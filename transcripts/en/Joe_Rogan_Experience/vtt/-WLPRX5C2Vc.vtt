WEBVTT

1
00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.610
<v Speaker 1>Boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're live back from Hawaii right</v>

2
00:00:05.611 --> 00:00:08.310
<v Speaker 1>before it fucking blows up and sinks</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the ocean.</v>

3
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:09.390
<v Speaker 1>Just in time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Woo.</v>

4
00:00:09.391 --> 00:00:14.160
<v Speaker 1>We barely made it when we were flying</v>
<v Speaker 1>above the big island as we were flying</v>

5
00:00:14.161 --> 00:00:15.420
<v Speaker 1>above.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's a matter?</v>

6
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.140
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As we were flying above the big island,</v>

7
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.770
<v Speaker 1>a 6.9 earthquake blew up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

8
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.300
<v Speaker 1>That's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

9
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.440
<v Speaker 1>Shane Dorian fucking lives there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We looked out the window and saw the</v>

10
00:00:28.441 --> 00:00:31.190
<v Speaker 1>island like explode in sync.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember that Ad.</v>

11
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.030
<v Speaker 1>That was so sad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at least,</v>

12
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean we had a good hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People were surfing though.</v>

13
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.070
<v Speaker 1>They caught those waves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're worried about a tsunami,</v>

14
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.950
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to sink,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's going to get bigger.</v>

15
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.060
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

16
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.340
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing is a fucking volcano.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are shocked.</v>

17
00:00:44.341 --> 00:00:45.360
<v Speaker 1>Weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The volcanoes.</v>

18
00:00:45.361 --> 00:00:46.340
<v Speaker 1>Volcano.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

19
00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You live on a Goddamn volcano.</v>

20
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.273
<v Speaker 1>Oh crap.</v>

21
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.380
<v Speaker 1>I wish it would have been out of fly</v>
<v Speaker 1>over it though.</v>

22
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was looking at the like the map of</v>

23
00:00:55.771 --> 00:00:56.850
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way we fly.</v>

24
00:00:56.851 --> 00:00:59.280
<v Speaker 1>We fly so we can't see it the entire</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

25
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is bullshit because it was cloudy.</v>

26
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.040
<v Speaker 1>Which is also bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would have been cool.</v>

27
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.010
<v Speaker 1>I even asked the guy like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which way do we go?</v>

28
00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be fucking awesome if we flew</v>

29
00:01:10.651 --> 00:01:11.840
<v Speaker 1>over that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

30
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.920
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>

31
00:01:13.921 --> 00:01:15.800
<v Speaker 1>Living on a volcano though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

32
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.330
<v Speaker 1>Good place to visit though is beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

33
00:01:18.331 --> 00:01:19.420
<v Speaker 1>stunning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

34
00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.360
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And where we were,</v>

35
00:01:21.361 --> 00:01:25.620
<v Speaker 1>we were on Lanai and alumni is an</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting place.</v>

36
00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.160
<v Speaker 1>3000 people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20,000 deer,</v>

37
00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:30.020
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

38
00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.710
<v Speaker 1>and so you do the math,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

39
00:01:31.711 --> 00:01:33.450
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is going to be gravy.</v>

40
00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.310
<v Speaker 1>There is way more deer than people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But God it was,</v>

41
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.930
<v Speaker 1>it's tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's tough hunting.</v>

42
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:41.273
<v Speaker 1>Hunting for sure.</v>

43
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.760
<v Speaker 1>Well this is one of the best examples,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

44
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.760
<v Speaker 1>of if you want to make an argument for</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting like this in certain situations,</v>

45
00:01:50.761 --> 00:01:54.270
<v Speaker 1>this is probably the best example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You must control the population in these</v>

46
00:01:54.271 --> 00:01:55.590
<v Speaker 1>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have any predators.</v>

47
00:01:55.591 --> 00:01:59.070
<v Speaker 1>And they evolved around tigers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They come from India.</v>

48
00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.480
<v Speaker 1>So these axis deer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were a gift from a Hong Kong to</v>

49
00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:08.460
<v Speaker 1>King Kamehameha the fifth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw your history lesson in 1860 and I</v>

50
00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:11.750
<v Speaker 1>was getting it all into it today because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to make my post about it as</v>

51
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.690
<v Speaker 1>awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

52
00:02:12.691 --> 00:02:14.410
<v Speaker 1>so they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did,</v>

53
00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.080
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the number that they shoot?</v>

54
00:02:16.081 --> 00:02:18.210
<v Speaker 1>How many did they shoot a week?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just to,</v>

55
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.650
<v Speaker 1>just to people and control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The population said 1500 but not a week</v>

56
00:02:22.651 --> 00:02:23.280
<v Speaker 1>was it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

57
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.840
<v Speaker 1>I think it was 30 a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

58
00:02:24.841 --> 00:02:27.000
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they were saying the shoot 30 a day,</v>

59
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.340
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they have to go at night.</v>

60
00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.220
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's night night vision scopes and</v>

61
00:02:32.221 --> 00:02:33.360
<v Speaker 1>shoot dose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

62
00:02:33.361 --> 00:02:35.010
<v Speaker 1>Just to take them out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to take them out.</v>

63
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.770
<v Speaker 1>Does that so many deer when we were</v>
<v Speaker 1>there at night,</v>

64
00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:38.880
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got,</v>

65
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.460
<v Speaker 1>first of all we got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got super lucky.</v>

66
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:42.331
<v Speaker 1>Thanks to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

67
00:02:42.331 --> 00:02:43.790
<v Speaker 1>you let me take that deer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

68
00:02:43.791 --> 00:02:45.330
<v Speaker 1>when white one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we landed,</v>

69
00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:47.940
<v Speaker 1>we went to Scout,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got out of the car,</v>

70
00:02:47.941 --> 00:02:52.941
<v Speaker 1>we went and looked around and within</v>
<v Speaker 1>five minutes we saw a buck feeding in a</v>

71
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.620
<v Speaker 1>doable spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I creeped in.</v>

72
00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.160
<v Speaker 1>It was total it w it just gives you a</v>
<v Speaker 1>distorted perception of your</v>

73
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.160
<v Speaker 2>chances of success because for the next</v>
<v Speaker 2>five days I got nothing until the last</v>

74
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.230
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in 15 minutes I got the first deer.</v>

75
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.610
<v Speaker 2>But when you get there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you realize how switched on these</v>

76
00:03:12.611 --> 00:03:14.940
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's,</v>

77
00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.330
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing like these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

78
00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've hunted in Africa,</v>

79
00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.190
<v Speaker 2>in the antelope there are pretty quick</v>
<v Speaker 2>also just like that just because of</v>

80
00:03:23.191 --> 00:03:25.310
<v Speaker 2>lions and hyenas and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

81
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.430
<v Speaker 2>just super jumpy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>twitchy.</v>

82
00:03:27.431 --> 00:03:29.650
<v Speaker 2>But in these deers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very similar,</v>

83
00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.350
<v Speaker 2>just quick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we were leaving that night when</v>

84
00:03:32.351 --> 00:03:33.840
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and me and Adam were in the truck and we</v>

85
00:03:33.841 --> 00:03:38.200
<v Speaker 2>were leaving and we turned the lights on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the truck and you could see hundreds of</v>

86
00:03:38.201 --> 00:03:39.530
<v Speaker 2>deer in front of us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

87
00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.510
<v Speaker 2>It was the craziest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it was like a crowd being led out</v>

88
00:03:43.511 --> 00:03:45.910
<v Speaker 2>of a concert or something like that or</v>
<v Speaker 2>basketball game,</v>

89
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.390
<v Speaker 2>basketball games over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause it is just that they're coming out</v>

90
00:03:49.391 --> 00:03:50.930
<v Speaker 2>of the trees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

91
00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.670
<v Speaker 2>crossing the road into the open field</v>
<v Speaker 2>where we'd been hunting and it's just</v>

92
00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:55.540
<v Speaker 2>hundreds.</v>

93
00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.750
<v Speaker 2>You can't imagine if you haven't been</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

94
00:03:57.751 --> 00:04:01.210
<v Speaker 2>You can't imagine if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you move there or if you just went</v>

95
00:04:01.211 --> 00:04:03.040
<v Speaker 2>there for a few days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd kind of get it.</v>

96
00:04:03.041 --> 00:04:03.761
<v Speaker 2>You'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

97
00:04:03.761 --> 00:04:05.710
<v Speaker 2>what do you do about these things?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

98
00:04:05.711 --> 00:04:09.400
<v Speaker 2>you can't give them birth control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they eat grass.</v>

99
00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.800
<v Speaker 2>So like how are you going to stop them</v>
<v Speaker 2>from breeding?</v>

100
00:04:11.801 --> 00:04:15.130
<v Speaker 2>You're not so what are you gonna do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're gonna introduce tigers to Lanai.</v>

101
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.740
<v Speaker 2>That would be cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That may be the only way to do it other</v>

102
00:04:17.741 --> 00:04:19.930
<v Speaker 2>than hunters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're going to start eating people</v>

103
00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:23.470
<v Speaker 2>just hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's such a destination for just</v>

104
00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.000
<v Speaker 2>getting good deer meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was thinking about it too,</v>

105
00:04:28.001 --> 00:04:30.370
<v Speaker 2>that stretch or are those hundreds of</v>
<v Speaker 2>deer cross the highway?</v>

106
00:04:30.371 --> 00:04:30.910
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

107
00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a straight as can be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can see,</v>

108
00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean great visibility,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the speed limit is 35 I think it's</v>

109
00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:41.260
<v Speaker 2>because deer are always jumped out in</v>
<v Speaker 2>front of cars there.</v>

110
00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.020
<v Speaker 2>People would be dying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

111
00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.960
<v Speaker 2>it seems like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is it 35 this is like you should be</v>

112
00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.680
<v Speaker 2>70 but so many deer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's also because they're like,</v>

113
00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:51.940
<v Speaker 2>where are you going?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

114
00:04:51.941 --> 00:04:52.910
<v Speaker 2>Slow down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

115
00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.630
<v Speaker 2>there's no hurry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the hurry man?</v>

116
00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.490
<v Speaker 2>Relax.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

117
00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.710
<v Speaker 2>3000 people on the island.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that,</v>

118
00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:00.910
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's part of it too.</v>

119
00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.460
<v Speaker 2>That islands so relaxed and the people</v>
<v Speaker 2>are so friendly.</v>

120
00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.740
<v Speaker 2>I was an awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>awesome place.</v>

121
00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:07.890
<v Speaker 2>It was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

122
00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:09.730
<v Speaker 2>anytime I go on a hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

123
00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:13.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm thankful for the experience and for</v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing the animals,</v>

124
00:05:13.541 --> 00:05:15.850
<v Speaker 2>but also meeting the people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

125
00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:17.170
<v Speaker 2>Alec,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bob,</v>

126
00:05:17.171 --> 00:05:18.730
<v Speaker 2>the butcher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

127
00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.360
<v Speaker 2>they're just like these people that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>ingrained in your,</v>

128
00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:24.160
<v Speaker 2>in your memory and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>

129
00:05:24.161 --> 00:05:25.960
<v Speaker 2>That's such a special part of the trip</v>
<v Speaker 2>also.</v>

130
00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the experience is very,</v>

131
00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.610
<v Speaker 2>very unusual because there's really not</v>
<v Speaker 2>a place like that that I know of</v>

132
00:05:33.611 --> 00:05:38.611
<v Speaker 2>anywhere on the planet that's just a</v>
<v Speaker 2>small island with a small population of</v>

133
00:05:38.831 --> 00:05:42.940
<v Speaker 2>people and a massive population of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>most delicious animals in the world.</v>

134
00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:47.290
<v Speaker 2>And even though there's so many of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good fucking luck getting one.</v>

135
00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:51.040
<v Speaker 2>Then we had our friend Ben O'brian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he went home empty handed.</v>

136
00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:55.620
<v Speaker 2>So one of us in a group of very</v>
<v Speaker 2>experienced hunters.</v>

137
00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean other than me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody in that group</v>

138
00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.530
<v Speaker 1>is super,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super experienced.</v>

139
00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:00.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

140
00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:05.890
<v Speaker 1>and still is no cake walk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These things are switched on and they</v>

141
00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:08.270
<v Speaker 1>dodge arrows like during the matrix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

142
00:06:08.271 --> 00:06:09.080
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>

143
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.550
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no gimmie's.</v>

144
00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:11.720
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's a,</v>

145
00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:14.030
<v Speaker 3>you can do everything right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can,</v>

146
00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.760
<v Speaker 3>you can think in your head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>While I travel all the way here,</v>

147
00:06:16.761 --> 00:06:18.560
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm here to hunt.</v>

148
00:06:18.561 --> 00:06:20.030
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need to take me home.</v>

149
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.690
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter those deer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no gimmie's.</v>

150
00:06:23.691 --> 00:06:27.080
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to stay alive and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>know what's up.</v>

151
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:30.440
<v Speaker 3>They get hunted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's every day because</v>

152
00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:32.300
<v Speaker 3>when their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when their antlers fall off,</v>

153
00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:33.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bucks probably are hunted.</v>

154
00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:35.930
<v Speaker 3>But because they're killing doe is at</v>
<v Speaker 3>night.</v>

155
00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.870
<v Speaker 3>They're hunted most days out of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>year.</v>

156
00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:41.960
<v Speaker 3>So they are as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as wired as it can be.</v>

157
00:06:41.961 --> 00:06:43.110
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they're,</v>

158
00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:44.390
<v Speaker 3>they're used to being pursued.</v>

159
00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:47.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's different than say like whitetail</v>

160
00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:50.400
<v Speaker 1>deer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like whitetail deer seem to kind of know</v>

161
00:06:50.401 --> 00:06:52.310
<v Speaker 1>when hunting season comes around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

162
00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:56.760
<v Speaker 1>Like when they're velvet drops off and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they rubbed their velvet off and then</v>

163
00:06:56.761 --> 00:06:58.950
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the females start coming into season.</v>

164
00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:02.460
<v Speaker 1>That's when they get fucking sketchy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>nervous because they know that guns are</v>

165
00:07:02.461 --> 00:07:03.520
<v Speaker 1>going to be going off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

166
00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:05.270
<v Speaker 1>arrows are going to be flying their way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

167
00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:08.400
<v Speaker 1>but you catch them during the summer and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then just kind of chilling.</v>

168
00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:10.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These things are never challenged</v>

169
00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.580
<v Speaker 3>polar in the winter after season.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just,</v>

170
00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:17.790
<v Speaker 3>they're a more focused on food and</v>
<v Speaker 3>putting on some weight to to make it</v>

171
00:07:17.861 --> 00:07:20.590
<v Speaker 3>through the winter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So other than hunting season,</v>

172
00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:22.300
<v Speaker 3>they are more chill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But these things,</v>

173
00:07:22.301 --> 00:07:23.620
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they ever get a day off.</v>

174
00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:26.830
<v Speaker 1>They don't get a day off and they can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>give him a day off because if they just,</v>

175
00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:28.810
<v Speaker 1>if everybody said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

176
00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.450
<v Speaker 1>let's just need these animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then man,</v>

177
00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:34.780
<v Speaker 1>if they did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would all die either of starvation</v>

178
00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:37.570
<v Speaker 1>or they would die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they had to eradicate the goat</v>

179
00:07:37.571 --> 00:07:41.110
<v Speaker 1>population on the island because people</v>
<v Speaker 1>brought goats there and the goats</v>

180
00:07:41.111 --> 00:07:44.320
<v Speaker 1>literally had decimated the vegetation</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the point where the island started</v>

181
00:07:44.321 --> 00:07:47.200
<v Speaker 1>going into a drought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand this,</v>

182
00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:51.130
<v Speaker 1>but somehow or another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you eat all of the vegetation,</v>

183
00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:54.100
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rain stops falling in certain areas</v>

184
00:07:54.101 --> 00:07:58.720
<v Speaker 1>where there's a lack of participation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reputation or condensation doesn't</v>

185
00:07:58.721 --> 00:08:02.620
<v Speaker 1>gather because there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no leaves to catch capture it.</v>

186
00:08:02.621 --> 00:08:06.340
<v Speaker 1>Or one of the ladies who lived there was</v>
<v Speaker 1>explaining it to me why they had to kill</v>

187
00:08:06.341 --> 00:08:07.160
<v Speaker 1>all the goats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

188
00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:08.020
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she was like,</v>

189
00:08:08.021 --> 00:08:09.970
<v Speaker 1>trees were dying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything was dying.</v>

190
00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:12.450
<v Speaker 1>And they're in the process right now of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

191
00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:16.120
<v Speaker 1>in Maui,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have this gigantic area that they</v>

192
00:08:16.121 --> 00:08:20.800
<v Speaker 1>are trying to eradicate deer from and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to fence it in to let the</v>

193
00:08:20.801 --> 00:08:25.240
<v Speaker 1>forest regrow because the forest doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a chance to regrow with again,</v>

194
00:08:25.241 --> 00:08:28.960
<v Speaker 1>same animal access deer because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>just eat all the little baby trees as a</v>

195
00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:31.480
<v Speaker 1>little trees are coming up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just chew those fuckers up and</v>

196
00:08:31.481 --> 00:08:33.850
<v Speaker 1>that's what they eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They shoots and they want the new</v>

197
00:08:33.851 --> 00:08:34.600
<v Speaker 1>browse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

198
00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:35.433
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Growth.</v>

199
00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:36.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

200
00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:39.670
<v Speaker 1>it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean as far as our trip goes.</v>

201
00:08:39.671 --> 00:08:40.930
<v Speaker 1>And that was another thing I wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 1>mention too,</v>

202
00:08:40.931 --> 00:08:42.730
<v Speaker 1>is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you said the group of people,</v>

203
00:08:42.731 --> 00:08:43.990
<v Speaker 1>Ben was one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

204
00:08:43.991 --> 00:08:44.521
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

205
00:08:44.521 --> 00:08:49.360
<v Speaker 1>we had just an awesome group of hunters</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are all our friends.</v>

206
00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:50.233
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

207
00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:52.360
<v Speaker 1>And some of the best bell hunters in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

208
00:08:52.361 --> 00:08:55.920
<v Speaker 1>And it was a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It a good time</v>

209
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.210
<v Speaker 4>hearing the stories from everybody was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

210
00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:02.010
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then John Dudley made an amazing meal,</v>

211
00:09:02.011 --> 00:09:06.490
<v Speaker 4>cooked up some meat one night and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is his cooking good man.</v>

212
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:09.870
<v Speaker 4>Good access dear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So delicious.</v>

213
00:09:09.871 --> 00:09:11.220
<v Speaker 4>It's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

214
00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:14.820
<v Speaker 4>It goes with my theory that the fastest</v>
<v Speaker 4>things are the most delicious because</v>

215
00:09:14.821 --> 00:09:16.680
<v Speaker 4>they're trying to get away cause they</v>
<v Speaker 4>know they taste good.</v>

216
00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:18.390
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe hey,</v>

217
00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:20.790
<v Speaker 4>it might be something to that salmon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How good is salmon?</v>

218
00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:21.990
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get me the fuck out of here.</v>

<v Speaker 4>But you don't like fish at all?</v>

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:52.140
<v Speaker 4>It was great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a,</v>

237
00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:57.440
<v Speaker 4>and just so much respect for guys like</v>
<v Speaker 4>those guys who are at the top of their</v>

238
00:09:58.591 --> 00:09:59.700
<v Speaker 4>game,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>

239
00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:02.550
<v Speaker 4>But learning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think people realize how hard it</v>

240
00:10:02.551 --> 00:10:03.660
<v Speaker 4>is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

241
00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:08.690
<v Speaker 4>So when I see these guys go out and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're successful with basically a</v>

242
00:10:08.821 --> 00:10:10.530
<v Speaker 4>sharp stick,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 4>it's on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially on an animal like that.</v>

244
00:10:13.231 --> 00:10:15.330

<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

247
00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:22.530
<v Speaker 4>when you see guys go out there and do</v>
<v Speaker 4>that on a new hunt in new country for</v>

266
00:11:10.861 --> 00:11:13.650
<v Speaker 4>elevated spot up on top of the hill.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was,</v>

267
00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:17.130
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you guys were up walking from a</v>

268
00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:18.180
<v Speaker 4>mile,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could see you easy,</v>

269
00:11:18.181 --> 00:11:19.410
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean binoculars,</v>

270
00:11:19.411 --> 00:11:21.420

<v Speaker 4>And then all of a sudden you're gone.</v>

271
00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:23.640
<v Speaker 4>And so I sit Alica Tech.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'm like,</v>

272
00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:25.530
<v Speaker 4>why are you guys hiding from me?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cause I was just like,</v>

273
00:11:25.531 --> 00:11:29.100
<v Speaker 4>you have to really glass really gas and</v>
<v Speaker 4>that'd be like there was a head okay</v>

274
00:11:29.101 --> 00:11:30.690
<v Speaker 4>there head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay now I see you guys.</v>

275
00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:33.780

<v Speaker 4>crawling for a long time.</v>

276
00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:35.700
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let me think how long,</v>

277
00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:40.050
<v Speaker 4>I would say an hour almost.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We crawled for an hour,</v>

278
00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:44.310
<v Speaker 4>an hour to get a quarter mile and it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is a lot of work.</v>

279
00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:46.500
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got a bow so you had a bow in your</v>

280
00:11:46.501 --> 00:11:50.250
<v Speaker 4>hand and I didn't have anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you're moving that bow with each.</v>

281
00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:54.310
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whatever you crawling step and in</v>

282
00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:57.180
<v Speaker 1>as basically doing a plank for an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

283
00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:00.700
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was winded by the time we got to where</v>

284
00:12:00.701 --> 00:12:02.470
<v Speaker 1>the deer were and now it's like take a</v>
<v Speaker 1>deep breath,</v>

285
00:12:02.471 --> 00:12:05.680
<v Speaker 1>take a deep breath because we got within</v>
<v Speaker 1>55 yards and I'm like,</v>

286
00:12:05.681 --> 00:12:07.690
<v Speaker 1>we're good right here and this is a good</v>
<v Speaker 1>spot.</v>

287
00:12:07.691 --> 00:12:12.490
<v Speaker 1>We're behind a Bush but it like my</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoulders are sore as I was doing</v>

288
00:12:12.491 --> 00:12:13.300
<v Speaker 1>pushups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

289
00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:16.630
<v Speaker 1>Cause like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're crawling like a cat,</v>

290
00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:19.900
<v Speaker 1>so you're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you try to be super quiet.</v>

291
00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:23.290
<v Speaker 1>So like if you saw us do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are listening,</v>

292
00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:26.800
<v Speaker 1>you're crawling but you're not just kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of crawling along.</v>

293
00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:31.130
<v Speaker 1>You're crawling as quietly as you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Kimmy,</v>

294
00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:35.990
<v Speaker 1>a deep respect for camouflage too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I was wearing a camouflage face</v>

295
00:12:35.991 --> 00:12:40.991
<v Speaker 1>mask and that hat and I had a camouflage</v>
<v Speaker 1>backpack by the final day I had gloves</v>

00:12:41.081 --> 00:12:43.030
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was fucking fully cam mode.</v>

<v Speaker 1>We went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>took the shoes off,</v>

298
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.920
<v Speaker 1>we were crawling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of it was in wool socks just so he</v>

299
00:12:47.921 --> 00:12:49.450
<v Speaker 1>could be even more quiet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

300
00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:50.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you can't take to greater measures on</v>

302
00:12:54.281 --> 00:12:56.890
<v Speaker 1>being more stealthier quiet on these</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals.</v>

303
00:12:56.910 --> 00:12:58.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

304
00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:00.400
<v Speaker 1>immediately I put up the post and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

305
00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:02.770
<v Speaker 1>I saw one negative comment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

306
00:13:02.771 --> 00:13:04.060

<v Speaker 1>I'm reading this shit.</v>

307
00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:06.710

<v Speaker 1>was there,</v>

308
00:13:06.711 --> 00:13:10.100
<v Speaker 1>it was my phone fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dropped my phone on the first day and</v>

00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:16.750
<v Speaker 1>And so I had to get a new phone so I</v>
<v Speaker 1>ordered a new phone and had it shipped</v>

312
00:13:16.751 --> 00:13:18.580
<v Speaker 1>to the island.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I was doing that,</v>

313
00:13:18.581 --> 00:13:21.520
<v Speaker 1>I didn't use anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't use any APPS.</v>

314
00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:25.660
<v Speaker 1>I didn't check my email,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't check twitter and I felt</v>

315
00:13:25.661 --> 00:13:26.494
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

317
00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:32.650
<v Speaker 1>I went cold Turkey for three days and</v>
<v Speaker 1>while I was out there going cold Turkey,</v>

318
00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:34.390
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel better.</v>

319
00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:37.600
<v Speaker 1>Like this is better.</v>

<v Speaker 1>But what are you looking for?</v>

332
00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:07.900
<v Speaker 1>Let's can we get this out of the news.</v>

333

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

335
00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:14.230

<v Speaker 1>since that time?</v>

336
00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:17.830
<v Speaker 1>You know it's irritating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you pay $135,000 like,</v>

337
00:14:17.831 --> 00:14:19.750
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're going to just keep it on the</v>

338
00:14:19.751 --> 00:14:20.441
<v Speaker 1>DL,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

339
00:14:20.441 --> 00:14:23.080
<v Speaker 1>We're good hundred 35 and then get the</v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

340
00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:27.490
<v Speaker 1>Now she's talking well deals that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't think she has that money anymore.</v>

341
00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:30.250
<v Speaker 1>I think she spent it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

342
00:14:30.251 --> 00:14:31.130
<v Speaker 1>she needs more money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

343
00:14:31.131 --> 00:14:35.440
<v Speaker 1>she needs more money and I think she</v>
<v Speaker 1>realizes this is an opportunity for,</v>

344
00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:40.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to look at it because</v>

345
00:14:40.111 --> 00:14:41.920
<v Speaker 1>on one hand I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

346
00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:46.500
<v Speaker 1>I think we should hold the president up</v>
<v Speaker 1>to higher standards and you,</v>

347
00:14:46.501 --> 00:14:49.720
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't be able to just lie all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time and be the president because</v>

348
00:14:49.721 --> 00:14:52.670
<v Speaker 1>how could we trust you if it comes to</v>
<v Speaker 1>something serious,</v>

349
00:14:52.671 --> 00:14:56.990
<v Speaker 1>like a warm war with China or some</v>
<v Speaker 1>something crazy or invading Iran.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you banged a porn star.</v>

354
00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:10.460

<v Speaker 1>10 years before he was elected or</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

360
00:15:20.211 --> 00:15:22.400
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't have fucked this porn star,</v>

361
00:15:22.401 --> 00:15:24.050
<v Speaker 1>but I couldn't help myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a pig,</v>

362
00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:27.140
<v Speaker 1>but I'm doing a good job as a president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The economy is up.</v>

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:32.120
<v Speaker 3>Support the troops,</v>
<v Speaker 3>troops,</v>

366
00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:33.770
<v Speaker 3>port,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the NRA.</v>

367
00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:34.820
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's the,</v>

368
00:15:34.821 --> 00:15:37.700
<v Speaker 3>I'm paying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you say you can't trust them because</v>

369
00:15:37.701 --> 00:15:39.870
<v Speaker 3>if you lie about this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

370
00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:43.010
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you say another president,</v>

371
00:15:43.011 --> 00:15:44.750
<v Speaker 3>how do you know they're not lying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are lying.</v>

372
00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:45.673
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

373
00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:47.370
<v Speaker 1>I think deval lied.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

374
00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:49.140
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that,</v>

375
00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:50.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a conversation with a friend of</v>

376
00:15:50.971 --> 00:15:55.050
<v Speaker 1>mine about a Hillary Clinton and he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a big Hillary Clinton supporter to</v>

377
00:15:55.051 --> 00:15:59.040
<v Speaker 1>the point where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he like Jamie with the cavaliers hat on,</v>

378
00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:00.750
<v Speaker 1>he might as well have a Hillary Clinton</v>
<v Speaker 1>hat on.</v>

379
00:16:00.751 --> 00:16:03.600
<v Speaker 1>He's like a Hillary Clinton says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure they do.</v>

380
00:16:03.601 --> 00:16:05.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure they had them right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm with her.</v>

381
00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:08.940
<v Speaker 1>This guy is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>him and his wife are both like Super</v>

382
00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:12.270
<v Speaker 1>Hillary supporters and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't bother you at all that she</v>

383
00:16:12.271 --> 00:16:14.850
<v Speaker 1>deleted 30,000 emails.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it doesn't bother you at all.</v>

384
00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:18.510
<v Speaker 1>Like they told her there's a probe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need to see all your emails,</v>

385
00:16:18.511 --> 00:16:20.280
<v Speaker 1>just deleted them all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't bother you.</v>

386
00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:22.680
<v Speaker 1>Like that doesn't seem like maybe she's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a liar.</v>

387
00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:26.010
<v Speaker 1>And then when you hear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>call me his account of what happened</v>

388
00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:29.130
<v Speaker 1>versus her account of what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's clearly not being honest.</v>

389
00:16:29.131 --> 00:16:30.990
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't bother you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

390
00:16:30.991 --> 00:16:32.940
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in comparison she doesn't apply</v>

391
00:16:32.941 --> 00:16:33.451
<v Speaker 1>as much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

392
00:16:33.451 --> 00:16:35.460
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like these are lies.</v>

393
00:16:35.461 --> 00:16:37.200
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter in comparison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

394
00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:41.100
<v Speaker 1>So my point is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think anybody who gets to that level</v>

395
00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:45.210
<v Speaker 1>of that business is slimy and one way or</v>
<v Speaker 1>another,</v>

396
00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:46.800
<v Speaker 1>everyone's slimy</v>

397
00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:50.860
<v Speaker 3>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we would like you to not be,</v>

398
00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:52.300
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'd be great.</v>

399
00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:55.180
<v Speaker 3>We'd like everybody to not be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

400
00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:56.660
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dunno.</v>

401
00:16:56.710 --> 00:17:01.120
<v Speaker 3>I think the only way to get to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>bottom of it is get him on the podcast.</v>

402
00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:03.690
<v Speaker 3>I would love to get him on the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll have to get them drunk.</v>

403
00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:05.060
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't drink.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

404
00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:07.050
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I was wondering.</v>

405
00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:11.440
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most people have podcasts that aren't</v>

406
00:17:12.090 --> 00:17:14.020
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost the Joe Rogan,</v>

407
00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:17.160
<v Speaker 3>but that's almost true right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like most people do have podcasts and</v>

408
00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:17.710
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

409
00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:18.060
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

410
00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:18.940
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now let me finish.</v>

411
00:17:18.941 --> 00:17:20.590
<v Speaker 3>So most people that do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'd be like,</v>

412
00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:24.490
<v Speaker 3>they got this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get this a dream guest list.</v>

413
00:17:24.491 --> 00:17:24.901
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

414
00:17:24.901 --> 00:17:27.640
<v Speaker 3>the wishlist and these are my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd love to have these people.</v>

415
00:17:28.090 --> 00:17:31.300
<v Speaker 3>And I was thinking about you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like it seems like,</v>

416
00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:32.320
<v Speaker 3>and I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not you,</v>

417
00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:37.350
<v Speaker 3>but like the Courtney to Walter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people you're interested in are more</v>

418
00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:43.000
<v Speaker 3>important to you than say like the Ala,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the like uh,</v>

419
00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:44.650
<v Speaker 3>the president United States.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

420
00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:49.660
<v Speaker 3>so how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you have a wishlist of I don't have</v>

421
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:51.280
<v Speaker 1>a wishlist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

422
00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:53.040
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were talking about this on the plane</v>

423
00:17:53.041 --> 00:17:54.210
<v Speaker 1>ride.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

424
00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:56.450
<v Speaker 1>I like talking to my friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

425
00:17:56.490 --> 00:17:57.780
<v Speaker 1>I like talking to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

426
00:17:57.810 --> 00:18:01.350
<v Speaker 1>I like talking to interesting people</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the sleep expert hat on the all the</v>

427
00:18:01.351 --> 00:18:03.990
<v Speaker 1>day Matthew Walker or pete you didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

428
00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:07.470
<v Speaker 1>and he's telling me he sleeps three</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours a night,</v>

429
00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:12.330
<v Speaker 1>so I didn't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to ignore him that you said</v>

430
00:18:12.331 --> 00:18:13.290
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy,</v>

431
00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:15.420
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you Monday we have Michael Chandler.</v>

432
00:18:15.421 --> 00:18:17.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking forward to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

433
00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:21.090
<v Speaker 1>I like talking to interesting people and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have to be famous to me at</v>

434
00:18:21.091 --> 00:18:23.490
<v Speaker 1>all right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of my favorite podcasts for people</v>

435
00:18:23.491 --> 00:18:24.670
<v Speaker 1>that aren't famous at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

436
00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:29.790
<v Speaker 1>Just like people that are interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's obviously a pretty blanket</v>

437
00:18:31.441 --> 00:18:34.470
<v Speaker 1>statement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I like people that are doing things</v>

438
00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:36.690
<v Speaker 1>that are unique,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are,</v>

439
00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:40.770
<v Speaker 1>that are like masters at a craft.</v>

440
00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:44.130
<v Speaker 1>People that are working hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that inspire me.</v>

441
00:18:44.131 --> 00:18:45.700
<v Speaker 1>I like to be inspired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

442
00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:50.070
<v Speaker 1>like I like talking to people who are</v>
<v Speaker 1>curious and who've studied things,</v>

443
00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:52.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's Sean Carroll or Neil</v>

444
00:18:52.351 --> 00:18:57.240
<v Speaker 1>degrasse Tyson or people that understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that I don't understand so I can</v>

445
00:18:57.241 --> 00:18:59.220
<v Speaker 1>pick their brain and ask them questions</v>
<v Speaker 1>about stuff.</v>

446
00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:02.820
<v Speaker 1>That to me is interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but trump habits sitting down with</v>

447
00:19:02.821 --> 00:19:06.390
<v Speaker 1>trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But B to me like a lot like sitting down</v>

448
00:19:06.391 --> 00:19:08.300
<v Speaker 1>with my friend Alex Jones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's,</v>

449
00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:09.360
<v Speaker 1>it'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

450
00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:14.480
<v Speaker 1>like it would be the best I would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you talked to him for three</v>

451
00:19:14.551 --> 00:19:16.860
<v Speaker 1>hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what kind of crazy stuff would come out?</v>

452
00:19:16.861 --> 00:19:19.260
<v Speaker 1>It'd be awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really think that if he wasn't</v>

453
00:19:19.261 --> 00:19:20.400
<v Speaker 1>president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would like him.</v>

454
00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:22.530
<v Speaker 1>I would really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would like him,</v>

455
00:19:22.531 --> 00:19:24.120
<v Speaker 1>I would think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would think he's a character if I</v>

456
00:19:24.121 --> 00:19:26.910
<v Speaker 1>didn't have business to do with him</v>
<v Speaker 1>where I was worried about like,</v>

457
00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:28.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting screwed over in some sort of a</v>

458
00:19:28.861 --> 00:19:29.820
<v Speaker 1>deal or something like that.</v>

459
00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:33.270
<v Speaker 1>I would like him cause I would think</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a wild man and he's a character.</v>

460
00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:37.260
<v Speaker 1>He's a fucking seven year old dude with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the crazy fucking hair.</v>

461
00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:41.460
<v Speaker 1>He wears a red bat baseball hat</v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere that says make America great</v>

462
00:19:41.461 --> 00:19:42.450
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>

463
00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:44.310
<v Speaker 1>You can't even wear that hat in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bars.</v>

464
00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:47.220
<v Speaker 1>Could you imagine that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is so divisive.</v>

465
00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:50.610
<v Speaker 1>Like he's so the people are so</v>
<v Speaker 1>conflicted.</v>

466
00:19:50.611 --> 00:19:54.060
<v Speaker 1>One side of the other against him that</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you wear that hat they will kick you</v>

467
00:19:54.061 --> 00:19:55.120
<v Speaker 1>out of places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

468
00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:57.710
<v Speaker 1>What world do we live in?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

469
00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:02.010
<v Speaker 1>well you can't wear something that says</v>
<v Speaker 1>make America great again.</v>

470
00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:02.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How,</v>

471
00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:04.800
<v Speaker 1>how could that be considered?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything but positive.</v>

472
00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:06.510
<v Speaker 1>How's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand.</v>

473
00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:10.050
<v Speaker 1>But he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people hate him so much and that's,</v>

474
00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:11.063
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

475
00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:15.860
<v Speaker 1>to me even a great accomplishment from</v>
<v Speaker 1>what he's done is like,</v>

476
00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:19.290
<v Speaker 1>he's got so much hate and he's still</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at all the positives that happen.</v>

477
00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:21.630
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people don't think any positives</v>

478
00:20:21.631 --> 00:20:24.510
<v Speaker 1>that happened because if most people in</v>
<v Speaker 1>my most people,</v>

479
00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:26.160
<v Speaker 1>I think there has been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

480
00:20:26.161 --> 00:20:29.790
<v Speaker 1>I think most people live in an echo</v>
<v Speaker 1>chamber and if you're like my friend</v>

481
00:20:29.791 --> 00:20:33.840
<v Speaker 1>who's a giant Hillary Clinton supporter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all you hear is trust the devil.</v>

482
00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:36.780
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was like completely convinced that it</v>

483
00:20:36.781 --> 00:20:40.620
<v Speaker 1>was going down and trump's going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>kicked out of office in the first 60</v>

484
00:20:40.621 --> 00:20:41.970
<v Speaker 1>days and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trust me,</v>

485
00:20:41.971 --> 00:20:43.140
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to last a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

486
00:20:43.141 --> 00:20:46.290
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to last a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A year later he's crying and he's</v>

487
00:20:46.291 --> 00:20:48.000
<v Speaker 1>fucking pulling his hair out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's</v>

488
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:49.360
<v Speaker 3>going crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

489
00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:51.150
<v Speaker 3>like Marie Keith Olbermann?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

490
00:20:51.151 --> 00:20:53.380
<v Speaker 3>he's open and he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he retired that show.</v>

491
00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:54.510
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

492
00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:57.490
<v Speaker 3>I don't need to do this anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just a matter of days.</v>

493
00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:00.430
<v Speaker 3>That was fucking six months ago I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When did he,</v>

494
00:21:00.431 --> 00:21:02.600
<v Speaker 3>when did he quit the resistance?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

495
00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:05.920
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't soon enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he just had to fucking take a</v>

496
00:21:05.921 --> 00:21:07.870
<v Speaker 3>break.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he was losing his marbles,</v>

497
00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:12.580
<v Speaker 3>but they're so interested in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>negative narrative that they're not,</v>

498
00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:14.410
<v Speaker 3>they won't even promote anything</v>
<v Speaker 3>positive.</v>

499
00:21:14.411 --> 00:21:18.760
<v Speaker 3>So it's like when he was saying all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>rocket man stuff,</v>

500
00:21:18.761 --> 00:21:19.330
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

501
00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:21.550
<v Speaker 3>trump's going to cause a nuclear war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

502
00:21:21.551 --> 00:21:26.350
<v Speaker 3>now he's talking and now they're in</v>
<v Speaker 3>negotiations with North Korea and south,</v>

503
00:21:26.351 --> 00:21:28.990
<v Speaker 3>north and south are talking and he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

504
00:21:29.050 --> 00:21:30.730
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trump had nothing to do with it.</v>

505
00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:31.390
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

506
00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:34.630
<v Speaker 3>how could he almost our nuclear war and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then have nothing to do with what's</v>

507
00:21:34.631 --> 00:21:35.170
<v Speaker 3>going on?</v>

508
00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:37.180
<v Speaker 3>It's like it can't be both.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

509
00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:39.670
<v Speaker 3>Well I guess it probably could if they</v>
<v Speaker 3>were like,</v>

510
00:21:39.671 --> 00:21:41.290
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's not start a nuclear war.</v>

511
00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:43.820
<v Speaker 3>How about what you and I talk like north</v>
<v Speaker 3>and South Korea,</v>

512
00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:45.310
<v Speaker 3>so let's get together and figure this</v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

513
00:21:45.311 --> 00:21:48.450
<v Speaker 3>This crazy ass hole on the other side of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the country or the world rather than,</v>

514
00:21:48.451 --> 00:21:49.390
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he's,</v>

515
00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:52.060
<v Speaker 3>he deserves credit for that sense of</v>
<v Speaker 3>respect.</v>

516
00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:56.200
<v Speaker 3>He's very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a very interesting guy and the fact</v>

517
00:21:56.201 --> 00:22:01.201
<v Speaker 3>that his methods are so outrageous and</v>
<v Speaker 3>outside the norm,</v>

518
00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:04.760
<v Speaker 3>then I don't think these world leaders</v>
<v Speaker 3>know what the fuck to do with him when</v>

519
00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:09.370
<v Speaker 3>he gets calling him rocket man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know my buttons bigger than yours.</v>

520
00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:10.300
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

521
00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:11.830
<v Speaker 3>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he says crazy shit.</v>

522
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.110
<v Speaker 3>He says crazy shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's what he's always done.</v>

523
00:22:17.111 --> 00:22:18.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

524
00:22:18.011 --> 00:22:19.330
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's consistent.</v>

525
00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:22.120
<v Speaker 3>We just expect them to do something</v>
<v Speaker 3>different because he's the president</v>

526
00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:26.350
<v Speaker 3>right now your working,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were talking about this on the plane</v>

527
00:22:26.351 --> 00:22:28.300
<v Speaker 3>too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're working with.</v>

528
00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:31.610

<v Speaker 3>your position in the administration</v>

529
00:22:31.611 --> 00:22:35.560
<v Speaker 3>because you actually have a wildlife</v>
<v Speaker 3>conservation position now in the</v>

530

<v Speaker 3>government.</v>

<v Speaker 3>going to happen?</v>

<v Speaker 3>Swear to God.</v>

582
00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:28.480
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

583
00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:32.960
<v Speaker 3>this the be good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause it was after.</v>

584
00:24:32.961 --> 00:24:35.240
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so trump put out the tweet and he said</v>

585
00:24:35.241 --> 00:24:39.500
<v Speaker 3>something like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't see how hunting for elephants</v>

586
00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:43.040
<v Speaker 3>is conservation or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or helps wildlife.</v>

587
00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:44.810
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a horror show.</v>

588
00:24:44.811 --> 00:24:46.830
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't know elephants or any other</v>
<v Speaker 3>animal,</v>

589
00:24:46.831 --> 00:24:48.230
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

590
00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:50.870
<v Speaker 3>what in the hell is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are we talking about?</v>

591
00:24:50.910 --> 00:24:52.820
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>elephants talk about elephants,</v>

592
00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:53.570
<v Speaker 3>that's fine.</v>

593
00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:55.250
<v Speaker 3>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he said,</v>

594
00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:58.070
<v Speaker 3>or any other animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I took that tweet,</v>

595
00:24:58.430 --> 00:25:03.430
<v Speaker 3>I posted it and addressed it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I don't know if he saw it,</v>

596
00:25:03.561 --> 00:25:06.320
<v Speaker 3>I don't really know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But soon after that I got a call for</v>

597
00:25:06.321 --> 00:25:07.880
<v Speaker 3>this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

598
00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:10.100
<v Speaker 3>cause I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

599
00:25:10.101 --> 00:25:13.040
<v Speaker 3>I know just from had in Africa and how</v>
<v Speaker 3>it works.</v>

600
00:25:13.041 --> 00:25:14.290
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

601
00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:18.170
<v Speaker 3>the hunting is necessary over there if</v>
<v Speaker 3>the animals are going to survive,</v>

602
00:25:18.171 --> 00:25:20.570
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if that's a complicated story.</v>

603
00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:23.400
<v Speaker 3>It's a complicated situation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but people,</v>

604
00:25:23.401 --> 00:25:25.600
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people don't want to hear that now.</v>

605
00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:29.960
<v Speaker 3>So here's an example of in Tanzania</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a,</v>

606
00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:34.640
<v Speaker 3>the largest hunting concession,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm trying to think how big it was.</v>

607
00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:37.370
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't put the number on how big it</v>

608
00:25:37.371 --> 00:25:38.900
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they'd been in business for 40</v>

609
00:25:38.901 --> 00:25:40.550
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So a hunting concession is,</v>

610
00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:41.720
<v Speaker 3>is they have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

611
00:25:41.721 --> 00:25:46.190
<v Speaker 3>hunters from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>usually America go over there.</v>

612
00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:49.760
<v Speaker 3>They pay for the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the access to the land and they pay</v>

613
00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:53.240
<v Speaker 3>for the right to hunt these animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this place had been in business for</v>

614
00:25:53.241 --> 00:25:54.980
<v Speaker 3>40 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

615
00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:57.890
<v Speaker 3>they went out of business because of</v>
<v Speaker 3>this import ban.</v>

616
00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:03.040
<v Speaker 3>Obama put an import ban on the ivory of</v>
<v Speaker 3>elephants coming back as trophies,</v>

617
00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:09.110
<v Speaker 3>but also bottom lines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the line thing was right after cecil the</v>

618
00:26:09.111 --> 00:26:11.960
<v Speaker 3>lion and it was done as a political</v>
<v Speaker 3>measure,</v>

619
00:26:12.050 --> 00:26:13.820
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he put a ban on,</v>

620
00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:17.000
<v Speaker 3>you can go over there and hunt him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Still it cause you know,</v>

621
00:26:17.001 --> 00:26:19.670
<v Speaker 3>we're from America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can't say what's legal in Africa,</v>

622
00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:24.530
<v Speaker 3>but he can say what he did was say we</v>
<v Speaker 3>can hunt them whatever because they</v>

623
00:26:24.531 --> 00:26:26.330
<v Speaker 3>can't control that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can't bring them home.</v>

624
00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:31.280
<v Speaker 3>So nobody's going to go and spend 75,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>kill an elephant or 50,000 to kill a</v>

625
00:26:31.281 --> 00:26:32.660
<v Speaker 3>lion if they can't bring it home.</v>

626
00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:33.843
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

627
00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:36.920
<v Speaker 3>So that basically shut down hunting and</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

628
00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:40.760
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this outfit in Tanzania that had</v>

629
00:26:40.770 --> 00:26:43.160
<v Speaker 3>business business for 40 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

630
00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:48.350
<v Speaker 3>cause they went out of business about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's about two months ago now.</v>

631
00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:51.360
<v Speaker 3>And what happens is when they don't have</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

632
00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:53.940
<v Speaker 3>the concession,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can't pay for that land.</v>

633
00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:58.380
<v Speaker 3>It is given back to the people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And for us here,</v>

634
00:26:58.381 --> 00:26:58.951
<v Speaker 3>there'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

635
00:26:58.951 --> 00:27:01.140
<v Speaker 3>that's great you gave the land back to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people.</v>

636
00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:03.150
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not good to give the land back to</v>

637
00:27:03.151 --> 00:27:04.740
<v Speaker 3>the people there because if people can't</v>
<v Speaker 3>do anything,</v>

638
00:27:04.741 --> 00:27:06.900
<v Speaker 3>you don't have any money there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't just like,</v>

639
00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:10.440
<v Speaker 3>so what happens is a poacher is as soon</v>
<v Speaker 3>as the hunting concession moves out,</v>

640
00:27:10.441 --> 00:27:15.441
<v Speaker 3>poachers move in and kill every animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only reason the animals that were</v>

641
00:27:15.961 --> 00:27:19.800
<v Speaker 3>being protected in that hunting</v>
<v Speaker 3>concession was because there was hunting</v>

642
00:27:19.801 --> 00:27:20.634
<v Speaker 3>in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These,</v>

643
00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:25.380
<v Speaker 3>this outfit would spin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think in the last three years they</v>

644
00:27:25.381 --> 00:27:29.010
<v Speaker 3>spent over $2 million on anti poaching</v>
<v Speaker 3>efforts.</v>

645
00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:32.610
<v Speaker 3>So $2 million to protect basically their</v>
<v Speaker 3>investment,</v>

646
00:27:32.611 --> 00:27:34.230
<v Speaker 3>which is those animals that were in</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

647
00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:36.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'd kill a couple because,</v>

648
00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:37.230
<v Speaker 3>because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

649
00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:40.440
<v Speaker 3>elephants were haunted and they ran the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ha's and probably lions.</v>

650
00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:44.130
<v Speaker 3>But by and large,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're protecting the majority of the</v>

651
00:27:44.131 --> 00:27:44.570
<v Speaker 3>herd.</v>

652
00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:45.171
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give me,</v>

653
00:27:45.171 --> 00:27:46.350
<v Speaker 1>give me those numbers again because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>

654
00:27:46.390 --> 00:27:48.920
<v Speaker 1>you were giving me the numbers on</v>
<v Speaker 1>elephants legally and illegally.</v>

655
00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:49.860
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

656
00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:51.870
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I asked this back at our first</v>

657
00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:55.110
<v Speaker 3>international wildlife conservation</v>
<v Speaker 3>council meeting and this,</v>

658
00:27:55.111 --> 00:27:57.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Peter was there and all these animal</v>

659
00:27:57.931 --> 00:27:59.790
<v Speaker 3>rights activists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

660
00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:02.850
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to say psychos that could</v>
<v Speaker 3>be disrespectful,</v>

661
00:28:02.851 --> 00:28:05.820
<v Speaker 3>but anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these extremists were there and so it</v>

662
00:28:05.821 --> 00:28:08.820
<v Speaker 3>was kind of heated in some point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some cases.</v>

663
00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:13.170
<v Speaker 3>But I did ask this question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many elephants are killed legally in</v>

664
00:28:13.171 --> 00:28:17.220
<v Speaker 3>Africa each year?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the number is about 400,</v>

665
00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:18.780
<v Speaker 3>400 a kid legally.</v>

666
00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:21.300
<v Speaker 1>The entire continent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

667
00:28:21.330 --> 00:28:24.510
<v Speaker 1>So g area so big that you can get</v>
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>

668
00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:27.480
<v Speaker 1>the United States of America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can also get all the European</v>

669
00:28:27.481 --> 00:28:29.640
<v Speaker 1>countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could fit a lot of shit in Africa.</v>

670
00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:31.450
<v Speaker 3>Africa is huge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>huge place.</v>

671
00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:32.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so there's some,</v>

672
00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:35.500
<v Speaker 3>there's some areas where you're not</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to hunt elephants because there's</v>

673
00:28:35.501 --> 00:28:37.940
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's not enough or um,</v>

674
00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:40.450
<v Speaker 3>they don't live there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there are some areas where there's</v>

675
00:28:40.451 --> 00:28:41.110
<v Speaker 3>too many elephant.</v>

676
00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:41.900
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

677
00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:43.260
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what's confusing to be where</v>

678
00:28:43.261 --> 00:28:45.770
<v Speaker 1>people here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>elephants are going extinct.</v>

679
00:28:45.771 --> 00:28:46.251
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

680
00:28:46.251 --> 00:28:48.620
<v Speaker 1>they are in some places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then another places.</v>

681
00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:53.480
<v Speaker 1>The problem is with local farmers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have these plots of land and the</v>

682
00:28:53.481 --> 00:28:56.870
<v Speaker 1>elephants come in and eat everything and</v>
<v Speaker 1>destroy their land and they can't do</v>

683
00:28:56.871 --> 00:28:58.250
<v Speaker 1>anything about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what are you going to do this?</v>

684
00:28:58.550 --> 00:28:59.660
<v Speaker 1>How the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how big is an elephant?</v>

685
00:28:59.661 --> 00:29:01.970
<v Speaker 1>How many thousands of pounds?</v>
<v Speaker 1>10,000 pounds or some shit.</v>

686
00:29:02.030 --> 00:29:03.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're huge.</v>

687
00:29:03.251 --> 00:29:05.080
<v Speaker 1>They're huge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't do a goddamn thing about</v>

688
00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:06.730
<v Speaker 1>care about elephants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't.</v>

689
00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:09.050
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the elephant is ruining my crop.</v>

690
00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:10.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I need to eat.</v>

691
00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:12.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to kill the elephant.</v>

692
00:29:12.211 --> 00:29:13.490
<v Speaker 1>It's going to lay there and rot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

693
00:29:13.491 --> 00:29:15.860
<v Speaker 1>There's these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people are starving.</v>

694
00:29:16.130 --> 00:29:19.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a food chain going on there and</v>

695
00:29:19.761 --> 00:29:22.730
<v Speaker 1>humans here where we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

696
00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:26.600
<v Speaker 1>we're so far above the food chain that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're like sitting in a platform looking</v>

697
00:29:26.601 --> 00:29:27.620
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching it.</v>

698
00:29:28.010 --> 00:29:29.570
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're embedded in it.</v>

699
00:29:29.610 --> 00:29:30.170
<v Speaker 1>There on</v>

700
00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:31.100
<v Speaker 3>level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll in there,</v>

701
00:29:31.101 --> 00:29:32.360
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the whole,</v>

702
00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:37.930
<v Speaker 3>it's a whole analogy of you can't have</v>
<v Speaker 3>first world world people solving third</v>

703
00:29:38.571 --> 00:29:41.380
<v Speaker 3>world problems and it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

704
00:29:41.381 --> 00:29:43.180
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people here have all the answers.</v>

705
00:29:43.181 --> 00:29:45.850
<v Speaker 3>It's like you have everything you want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have,</v>

706
00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:48.130
<v Speaker 3>you live in excess,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're fat,</v>

707
00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:49.900
<v Speaker 3>you have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you throw food away.</v>

708
00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:52.840
<v Speaker 3>What are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you have no idea what it's like in</v>

709
00:29:52.841 --> 00:29:56.380
<v Speaker 3>Africa?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they're 400 elephants are killed</v>

710
00:29:56.381 --> 00:29:58.780
<v Speaker 3>legally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>30,000 are poached a year,</v>

711
00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:04.350
<v Speaker 3>30,000 and the reason that's happening</v>
<v Speaker 3>is because the hunting had to move out.</v>

712
00:30:04.361 --> 00:30:08.950
<v Speaker 3>The hunting closed down or hunting is</v>
<v Speaker 3>what pays for the anti poaching efforts,</v>

713
00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:14.020
<v Speaker 3>but when hunting money isn't there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the poachers run rampant 30,000</v>

714
00:30:14.021 --> 00:30:16.210
<v Speaker 3>elephants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why they are devastated.</v>

715
00:30:16.290 --> 00:30:19.230
<v Speaker 1>It's such a not hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's such a hard thing for people to</v>

716
00:30:19.231 --> 00:30:23.040
<v Speaker 1>swallow because what this is from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>point of view of someone who loves</v>

717
00:30:23.041 --> 00:30:24.990
<v Speaker 1>wildlife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this is what people want.</v>

718
00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:29.910
<v Speaker 1>What they want is the humans to leave</v>
<v Speaker 1>the animals alone and the animals to</v>

719
00:30:29.911 --> 00:30:34.470
<v Speaker 1>live in this state of bliss where they</v>
<v Speaker 1>exist perfectly,</v>

720
00:30:34.471 --> 00:30:39.120
<v Speaker 1>and the balance of nature of Predator</v>
<v Speaker 1>and prey all plays out in a natural way</v>

721
00:30:39.330 --> 00:30:42.990
<v Speaker 1>without people going over there and</v>
<v Speaker 1>shooting elephants than sticking their</v>

722
00:30:42.991 --> 00:30:44.450
<v Speaker 1>tusks on their wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

723
00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:49.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean we've all seen those pictures of</v>
<v Speaker 1>these giant fat fucks holding a rifle</v>

724
00:30:49.081 --> 00:30:52.650
<v Speaker 1>standing over a lie and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this just looks wrong.</v>

725
00:30:52.690 --> 00:30:55.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like American gluttony makes</v>

726
00:30:55.531 --> 00:30:59.690
<v Speaker 1>its way over to Africa and some guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoots a line with a rifle.</v>

727
00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:03.630
<v Speaker 1>Now he's standing on its head and he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to put it on his wall and it's fat</v>

728
00:31:03.631 --> 00:31:06.510
<v Speaker 1>fucking house somewhere that bothers</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

729
00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:07.950
<v Speaker 1>I get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it too.</v>

730
00:31:08.010 --> 00:31:10.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not arguing that,</v>

731
00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:13.020
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you got to fix Africa first and you,</v>

732
00:31:13.021 --> 00:31:16.650
<v Speaker 1>you're not trying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this idea that if you just leave all</v>

733
00:31:16.651 --> 00:31:18.330
<v Speaker 1>those animals alone and stop hunting</v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

734
00:31:18.331 --> 00:31:19.560
<v Speaker 1>everything's going to be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

735
00:31:19.561 --> 00:31:21.330
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be wiped out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to,</v>

736
00:31:21.390 --> 00:31:25.620
<v Speaker 1>people have to look at it pragmatically</v>
<v Speaker 1>first and then idealistically.</v>

737
00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:29.250
<v Speaker 1>Cause pragmatically you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand that these animals,</v>

738
00:31:29.251 --> 00:31:32.100
<v Speaker 1>20 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're on the verge of extinction.</v>

739
00:31:32.101 --> 00:31:35.910
<v Speaker 1>So many different antelopes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so many different what we'd call game</v>

740
00:31:35.911 --> 00:31:37.380
<v Speaker 1>animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals that people eat.</v>

741
00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:41.940
<v Speaker 1>We're on the verge of extinction until</v>
<v Speaker 1>they started instituting these big</v>

742
00:31:41.941 --> 00:31:46.290
<v Speaker 1>hunting concessions and having people</v>
<v Speaker 1>come in from Europe and America and</v>

743
00:31:46.291 --> 00:31:49.980
<v Speaker 1>hunting in Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the community started to prosper</v>

744
00:31:49.981 --> 00:31:52.140
<v Speaker 1>because if someone's paying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

745
00:31:52.141 --> 00:31:54.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how much is it to shoot</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

746
00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:56.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a neil guy or something like that,</v>

747
00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:59.700
<v Speaker 1>maybe 1500.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So think of how many of those things get</v>

748
00:31:59.701 --> 00:32:01.980
<v Speaker 1>shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some of that money goes to the</v>

749
00:32:01.981 --> 00:32:03.690
<v Speaker 1>ranch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of that money goes to the</v>

750
00:32:03.691 --> 00:32:06.600
<v Speaker 1>professional hunting guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anti poaching conservation efforts,</v>

751
00:32:06.810 --> 00:32:11.610
<v Speaker 1>and then you have unprecedented numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's more of those animals today than</v>

752
00:32:11.611 --> 00:32:15.930
<v Speaker 1>there have been in decades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's all because people put value on</v>

753
00:32:15.931 --> 00:32:16.120
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

754
00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:18.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all about the animals have to have</v>

755
00:32:18.191 --> 00:32:20.200
<v Speaker 3>value and people will say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no will,</v>

756
00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:22.420
<v Speaker 3>the animal has value being alive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

757
00:32:22.421 --> 00:32:22.970
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

758
00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:24.590
<v Speaker 1>well it does to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It starts to you.</v>

759
00:32:24.591 --> 00:32:26.210
<v Speaker 1>If you don't live over there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're not pouring,</v>

760
00:32:26.211 --> 00:32:27.500
<v Speaker 1>your children aren't starving to death.</v>

761
00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:31.300
<v Speaker 3>A picture of an of a line is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

762
00:32:31.301 --> 00:32:34.780
<v Speaker 3>And that animal is beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's value in being alive,</v>

763
00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:38.860
<v Speaker 3>but he got to understand those people</v>
<v Speaker 3>need to eat,</v>

764
00:32:38.861 --> 00:32:40.220
<v Speaker 3>they need to work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if they're not,</v>

765
00:32:40.221 --> 00:32:42.380
<v Speaker 3>we're working for the hunting</v>
<v Speaker 3>concession.</v>

766
00:32:42.410 --> 00:32:44.150
<v Speaker 3>If the Huntington session goes out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>business,</v>

767
00:32:44.151 --> 00:32:46.760
<v Speaker 3>like the largest one in Tanzania did</v>
<v Speaker 3>after 40 years,</v>

768
00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:50.030
<v Speaker 3>what are they going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can't go get a job at the mill,</v>

769
00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:51.230
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no,</v>

770
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:55.030
<v Speaker 3>there's not industry over there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what happens is as they would,</v>

771
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:57.680
<v Speaker 3>some of those people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't know for a fact,</v>

772
00:32:57.681 --> 00:32:59.690
<v Speaker 3>but I would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to make an educated guess if</v>

773
00:32:59.691 --> 00:33:04.691
<v Speaker 3>they would go from working as anti</v>
<v Speaker 3>poetry and officers are or are helping</v>

774
00:33:04.731 --> 00:33:07.850
<v Speaker 3>keep the animals alive is as part of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>anti poaching program.</v>

775
00:33:08.210 --> 00:33:09.530
<v Speaker 3>Straight to poaching.</v>

776
00:33:09.790 --> 00:33:10.623
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that,</v>

777
00:33:10.630 --> 00:33:12.940
<v Speaker 1>that's happened back and forth both</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways,</v>

778
00:33:12.941 --> 00:33:13.600
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

779
00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:16.720
<v Speaker 1>Former poachers became anti poaching</v>
<v Speaker 1>officers when the opportunity.</v>

780
00:33:16.770 --> 00:33:18.870
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they were great ones because they</v>

781
00:33:18.871 --> 00:33:20.760
<v Speaker 3>knew how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how it worked and they knew where the</v>

782
00:33:20.761 --> 00:33:23.310
<v Speaker 3>weaknesses were were and that saved</v>
<v Speaker 3>animals.</v>

783
00:33:23.790 --> 00:33:25.900
<v Speaker 3>But it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

784
00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:28.650
<v Speaker 3>it's sad because that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

785
00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:32.580
<v Speaker 3>that last two months without that</v>
<v Speaker 3>hunting concession there without the</v>

786
00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:34.440
<v Speaker 3>anti-poaching,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

787
00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:37.920
<v Speaker 3>program in place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guarantee it's been a slaughter.</v>

788
00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:42.120
<v Speaker 3>The animals that were being protected</v>
<v Speaker 3>are now just being slaughtered by</v>

789
00:33:42.121 --> 00:33:42.740
<v Speaker 3>poachers.</v>

790
00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:45.080
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the difference between looking at things</v>

791
00:33:45.081 --> 00:33:47.270
<v Speaker 1>pragmatically and looking at things</v>
<v Speaker 1>idealistically,</v>

792
00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:50.060
<v Speaker 1>idealistically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would like all those people in Africa</v>

793
00:33:50.061 --> 00:33:54.260
<v Speaker 1>to have plenty of food and plenty of</v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity for employment and plenty of</v>

794
00:33:54.261 --> 00:33:56.180
<v Speaker 1>things to do with their life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't.</v>

795
00:33:56.510 --> 00:33:57.171
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

796
00:33:57.171 --> 00:34:01.370
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the situation that had emerged with</v>

797
00:34:01.371 --> 00:34:05.060
<v Speaker 1>these hunting sessions is superior to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the situation that's in place now.</v>

798
00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:08.120
<v Speaker 1>And it's also superior for the animals</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>

799
00:34:08.121 --> 00:34:11.690
<v Speaker 1>including the lions in Zimbabwe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had to kill,</v>

800
00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:13.310
<v Speaker 1>look this up Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see if you could,</v>

801
00:34:13.311 --> 00:34:17.270
<v Speaker 1>cause they had to call,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was something along the lines</v>

802
00:34:17.271 --> 00:34:22.271
<v Speaker 1>of 200 lions recently because they had</v>
<v Speaker 1>decimated the undulate population</v>

803
00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:25.130
<v Speaker 1>because there weren't kept in check</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the,</v>

804
00:34:25.131 --> 00:34:26.750
<v Speaker 1>Angela,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way these,</v>

805
00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:31.460
<v Speaker 1>the balance of nature works out is you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to have a balance between Predator</v>

806
00:34:31.461 --> 00:34:33.890
<v Speaker 1>and prey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only way to keep the balance of</v>

807
00:34:33.891 --> 00:34:35.090
<v Speaker 1>Predator as humans.</v>

808
00:34:35.150 --> 00:34:36.980
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the only thing that exists unless</v>

809
00:34:36.981 --> 00:34:37.814
<v Speaker 1>they keep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

810
00:34:37.850 --> 00:34:38.840
<v Speaker 1>Zimbabwe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>loud,</v>

811
00:34:38.841 --> 00:34:41.930
<v Speaker 1>rive reserve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll call 200 lines to control a</v>

812
00:34:41.931 --> 00:34:45.140
<v Speaker 1>population explosion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Claiming hunters have been scared off by</v>

813
00:34:45.141 --> 00:34:49.130
<v Speaker 1>the outcry over seas of the line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing is so weird because what</v>

814
00:34:49.131 --> 00:34:52.670
<v Speaker 1>people just jump on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that you watched the lion king.</v>

815
00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:53.870
<v Speaker 1>Oh Simba.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

816
00:34:53.871 --> 00:34:57.650
<v Speaker 1>don't kill Simba and oh see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he's got a name and all this</v>

817
00:34:57.651 --> 00:35:01.310
<v Speaker 1>craziness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It got to such a weird point where there</v>

818
00:35:01.311 --> 00:35:06.311
<v Speaker 1>was this discussion about Cecil's</v>
<v Speaker 1>brother that Cecil's brother got killed</v>

819
00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:08.750
<v Speaker 1>Jericho and they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

820
00:35:08.751 --> 00:35:12.410
<v Speaker 1>they killed Jericho.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then people were relieved because</v>

821
00:35:12.411 --> 00:35:14.810
<v Speaker 1>they found it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a different line and it wasn't</v>

822
00:35:14.811 --> 00:35:16.790
<v Speaker 1>Cecil's brother Jericho.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is like,</v>

823
00:35:16.791 --> 00:35:18.530
<v Speaker 1>they're watching it goddamn reality</v>
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

824
00:35:18.531 --> 00:35:21.200
<v Speaker 1>It's like keeping up with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kardashians in Africa.</v>

825
00:35:21.410 --> 00:35:24.500
<v Speaker 1>Like will you give a shit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fucking name of the APP the</v>

826
00:35:24.501 --> 00:35:28.250
<v Speaker 1>African lion is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're crazy.</v>

827
00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:29.690
<v Speaker 1>It's not Jericho.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

828
00:35:29.691 --> 00:35:30.140
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

829
00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:31.910
<v Speaker 1>it's Michael the lion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's okay.</v>

830
00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:34.040
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Still a fucking lion.</v>

831
00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:37.780
<v Speaker 1>But this shows you this first world view</v>
<v Speaker 1>of</v>

832
00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:43.050
<v Speaker 2>this wildlife situation that is not</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideal by any stretch of the imagination.</v>

833
00:35:43.290 --> 00:35:45.510
<v Speaker 2>I think part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like with that the whole Cecil lion</v>

834
00:35:45.511 --> 00:35:47.510
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it gave people a purpose as like,</v>

835
00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:49.020
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have something to stand for.</v>

836
00:35:49.021 --> 00:35:52.950
<v Speaker 2>I have a purpose now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's where I know people are</v>

837
00:35:52.951 --> 00:35:55.260
<v Speaker 2>struggling out there finding what's my</v>
<v Speaker 2>purpose,</v>

838
00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:56.880
<v Speaker 2>what am I doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

839
00:35:56.881 --> 00:35:58.560
<v Speaker 2>and they're spinning their wheels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't,</v>

840
00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:02.070
<v Speaker 2>I dunno what they do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that gave them something to fight</v>

841
00:36:02.071 --> 00:36:04.950
<v Speaker 2>for and it wasn't right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It didn't help anything.</v>

842
00:36:04.951 --> 00:36:09.951
<v Speaker 2>It hurt those 200 lions could have been</v>
<v Speaker 2>$50,000 each to a hunter.</v>

843
00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:15.560
<v Speaker 2>$10 million or two went to Zimbabwe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stayed there or,</v>

844
00:36:16.170 --> 00:36:19.590
<v Speaker 2>or at least employed people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But no,</v>

845
00:36:19.650 --> 00:36:22.200
<v Speaker 2>they were killed in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was no game.</v>

846
00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:25.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it still sucks all across the board.</v>

847
00:36:25.051 --> 00:36:26.940
<v Speaker 2>It's sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole situation sucks.</v>

848
00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:32.360
<v Speaker 2>These weird high fence operations where</v>
<v Speaker 2>they let lions loose and then they let</v>

849
00:36:32.611 --> 00:36:35.850
<v Speaker 2>him out of the cage and then people show</v>
<v Speaker 2>up that day and the lines on what the</v>

850
00:36:35.851 --> 00:36:37.740
<v Speaker 2>fuck's going on and they shoot this</v>
<v Speaker 2>line.</v>

851
00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:39.570
<v Speaker 2>And then stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That sucks too.</v>

852
00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:40.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like that.</v>

853
00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:45.180
<v Speaker 2>The whole thing is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not look wildlife in Africa and the</v>

854
00:36:45.181 --> 00:36:48.330
<v Speaker 2>high fence wildlife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not ideal by any stretch of the</v>

855
00:36:48.331 --> 00:36:53.331
<v Speaker 2>imagination and these animals that were</v>
<v Speaker 2>going extinct and now aren't because</v>

856
00:36:53.431 --> 00:36:56.310
<v Speaker 2>people were hunting them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking strange.</v>

857
00:36:56.340 --> 00:37:00.600
<v Speaker 2>That's a strange balance that the only</v>
<v Speaker 2>reason they exist is so people can come</v>

858
00:37:00.601 --> 00:37:02.460
<v Speaker 2>over there and shoot him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we don't,</v>

859
00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:03.630
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want that.</v>

860
00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:06.510
<v Speaker 2>I mean I would like them to just exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well the thing,</v>

861
00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:09.120
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people aren't going to contribute</v>

862
00:37:09.121 --> 00:37:12.720
<v Speaker 2>that money to pay for the anti poaching</v>
<v Speaker 2>just to go take a picture.</v>

863
00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:15.810
<v Speaker 2>It's like if you go to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you go to the Missouri breaks or</v>

864
00:37:15.811 --> 00:37:19.080
<v Speaker 2>something like that and you go hunting</v>
<v Speaker 2>mule deer like those,</v>

865
00:37:19.110 --> 00:37:23.460
<v Speaker 2>that's what I like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like animals that exist because they,</v>

866
00:37:23.461 --> 00:37:24.300
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're their,</v>

867
00:37:24.301 --> 00:37:25.320
<v Speaker 2>this is their spot.</v>

868
00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:29.010
<v Speaker 2>This is where they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you go to the Missouri breaks</v>

869
00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:33.660
<v Speaker 2>and you go up into those those hills and</v>
<v Speaker 2>look for for mule deer,</v>

870
00:37:33.870 --> 00:37:36.240
<v Speaker 2>those fuckers have been there for</v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of years.</v>

871
00:37:36.241 --> 00:37:40.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have found skulls of deer of</v>

872
00:37:40.231 --> 00:37:43.890
<v Speaker 2>whitetail deer in Florida that are 2</v>
<v Speaker 2>million years old,</v>

873
00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:46.650
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're the exact same animal 2 million</v>

874
00:37:46.651 --> 00:37:49.560
<v Speaker 2>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so for millions of years longer than</v>

875
00:37:49.561 --> 00:37:54.450
<v Speaker 2>there have been human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those things have been in that form</v>

876
00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:57.240
<v Speaker 2>running around North America and</v>
<v Speaker 2>wherever the fuck they can.</v>

877
00:37:57.270 --> 00:37:59.280
<v Speaker 2>That's what I like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like that too,</v>

878
00:37:59.310 --> 00:38:03.300
<v Speaker 2>but don't forget that hunting has played</v>
<v Speaker 2>a part in keeping those numbers healthy.</v>

879
00:38:03.390 --> 00:38:04.860
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the deer and the elk,</v>

880
00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:07.870
<v Speaker 2>there's more deer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no big game animal in north.</v>

881
00:38:07.871 --> 00:38:11.580
<v Speaker 2>The big game animals in North American</v>
<v Speaker 2>now than there were a hundred years ago,</v>

882
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.610
<v Speaker 2>and that's through hunting and</v>
<v Speaker 2>conservation.</v>

883
00:38:14.970 --> 00:38:18.390
<v Speaker 2>That is true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also because 150 years ago,</v>

884
00:38:18.391 --> 00:38:20.850
<v Speaker 2>people went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking ham wiped out.</v>

885
00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:24.480
<v Speaker 2>Most of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was real bad when the market hunting</v>

886
00:38:24.481 --> 00:38:25.950
<v Speaker 2>before refrigeration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

887
00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:27.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we've learned from that.</v>

888
00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:28.171
<v Speaker 2>We learn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

889
00:38:28.171 --> 00:38:29.940
<v Speaker 2>this is how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is how we need to do it.</v>

890
00:38:29.941 --> 00:38:32.160
<v Speaker 2>This is how hunting fits in this</v>
<v Speaker 2>equation.</v>

891
00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:34.200
<v Speaker 2>And that's where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

892
00:38:34.201 --> 00:38:37.030
<v Speaker 2>we talked about the intro National</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wildlife Conservation Council.</v>

893
00:38:37.210 --> 00:38:41.680
<v Speaker 3>That's given me a a way in to talk about</v>
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of other things too.</v>

894
00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:44.650
<v Speaker 3>So one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we talk about animals in North</v>

895
00:38:44.651 --> 00:38:47.980
<v Speaker 3>America is a Ryan Zinky who is the</v>
<v Speaker 3>secretary of Interior.</v>

896
00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:51.550
<v Speaker 3>He created this new,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess it's a bill.</v>

897
00:38:51.551 --> 00:38:54.660
<v Speaker 3>I'm not like this political expert.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm about hunger,</v>

898
00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:58.270
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wear a flannel shirt and baseball hat,</v>

899
00:38:58.271 --> 00:39:00.400
<v Speaker 3>but he did create this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

900
00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:02.800
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to call it a bill,</v>

901
00:39:03.070 --> 00:39:08.070
<v Speaker 3>but that protects the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the winter that we call them wildlife</v>

902
00:39:08.771 --> 00:39:11.200
<v Speaker 3>corridor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's where the animals can go from</v>

903
00:39:11.210 --> 00:39:13.990
<v Speaker 3>December,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some arrange to winter range where</v>

904
00:39:13.991 --> 00:39:15.850
<v Speaker 3>there's not going to be development</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

905
00:39:15.970 --> 00:39:18.940
<v Speaker 3>So He created that because that's how</v>
<v Speaker 3>those animals like in Montana,</v>

906
00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:22.810
<v Speaker 3>make it through the winter if they're up</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the summer.</v>

907
00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:24.970
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they make it through,</v>

908
00:39:25.750 --> 00:39:28.150
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting in the fall and then all of a</v>

909
00:39:28.151 --> 00:39:31.360
<v Speaker 3>sudden winter hits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have to have a way down into the</v>

910
00:39:31.361 --> 00:39:35.260
<v Speaker 3>low country to where they can their</v>
<v Speaker 3>winter migration to where they can</v>

911
00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:38.440
<v Speaker 3>survive the snow and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and where they can make down.</v>

912
00:39:38.441 --> 00:39:43.390
<v Speaker 3>And there's good feed down there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If there's gas rigs or mineral mineral</v>

913
00:39:43.391 --> 00:39:46.480
<v Speaker 3>extraction efforts going on that impede</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

914
00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:49.450
<v Speaker 3>then they might get hung up up there and</v>
<v Speaker 3>get stuck in the snow and die.</v>

915
00:39:49.451 --> 00:39:53.800
<v Speaker 3>So he realizes that he realized the need</v>
<v Speaker 3>for that and he created this,</v>

916
00:39:53.830 --> 00:39:57.340
<v Speaker 3>this new program that's going to make</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure that there's no development in</v>

917
00:39:57.341 --> 00:39:59.350
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It keeps those corridors open and</v>

918
00:39:59.351 --> 00:40:02.260
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why our numbers do so well is</v>

919
00:40:02.261 --> 00:40:05.500
<v Speaker 3>because there's people like that with</v>
<v Speaker 3>the vision on keeping our animals</v>

920
00:40:05.501 --> 00:40:06.120
<v Speaker 3>healthy.</v>

921
00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:07.260
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is another thing that we talked</v>

922
00:40:07.261 --> 00:40:08.110
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

923
00:40:08.111 --> 00:40:10.770
<v Speaker 1>on the flight that I think is important</v>
<v Speaker 1>to bring up.</v>

924
00:40:10.830 --> 00:40:14.820
<v Speaker 1>Remember when there was this talk about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the state monument or the National</v>

925
00:40:14.821 --> 00:40:18.210
<v Speaker 1>Monument in Utah and a Patagonia put</v>
<v Speaker 1>that thing on their page.</v>

926
00:40:18.211 --> 00:40:20.010
<v Speaker 1>The president stole your land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

927
00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:25.460
<v Speaker 1>Explain what actually happened because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not what everybody thinks it is.</v>

928
00:40:25.771 --> 00:40:28.500
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Rinella said it best if you say the</v>

929
00:40:28.501 --> 00:40:32.070
<v Speaker 1>president stole your land,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not being accurate with your</v>

930
00:40:32.071 --> 00:40:33.570
<v Speaker 1>words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not what happened.</v>

931
00:40:33.630 --> 00:40:34.463
<v Speaker 1>It was</v>

932
00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:39.070
<v Speaker 3>Patagonia did an awesome marketing job I</v>
<v Speaker 3>made and that there was efforts by</v>

933
00:40:39.071 --> 00:40:42.200
<v Speaker 3>saying the present sold your land form.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I've heard,</v>

934
00:40:42.250 --> 00:40:45.010
<v Speaker 3>it resulted in a 15% increase in</v>
<v Speaker 3>business for them.</v>

935
00:40:45.011 --> 00:40:47.920
<v Speaker 3>So it worked great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But with the truth is,</v>

936
00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:50.920
<v Speaker 3>is a lot of people felt like Obama when</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

937
00:40:50.921 --> 00:40:55.921
<v Speaker 3>before he left office did um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and overreach on the national monument</v>

938
00:40:56.351 --> 00:41:00.010
<v Speaker 3>protection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so there's protecting the national</v>

939
00:41:00.011 --> 00:41:04.750
<v Speaker 3>monument and then which has a certain</v>
<v Speaker 3>area he protected,</v>

940
00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:07.990
<v Speaker 3>he wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it encompassed 2 million acres in that</v>

941
00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:11.560
<v Speaker 3>national monument designation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which seems excessive.</v>

942
00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:14.590
<v Speaker 3>What Zinky says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the secretary of Interior,</v>

943
00:41:14.591 --> 00:41:16.780
<v Speaker 3>he went in there and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's an excessive,</v>

944
00:41:16.781 --> 00:41:19.570
<v Speaker 3>that's an overreach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to scale it back to what it was</v>

945
00:41:19.571 --> 00:41:20.380
<v Speaker 3>before Obama did and</v>

946
00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:22.570
<v Speaker 1>did that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now why is it excessive though?</v>

947
00:41:22.571 --> 00:41:25.840
<v Speaker 1>This is what gets confusing to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People think that protecting land is</v>

948
00:41:25.841 --> 00:41:26.920
<v Speaker 1>never accessive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

949
00:41:26.921 --> 00:41:29.950
<v Speaker 1>What he wants to do is make sure people</v>
<v Speaker 1>have access and what,</v>

950
00:41:30.310 --> 00:41:31.250
<v Speaker 1>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

951
00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:34.310
<v Speaker 1>so what's the difference between the Wa</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way it is</v>

952
00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:37.040
<v Speaker 3>under Obama and the way it is under</v>
<v Speaker 3>Zinky?</v>

953
00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:40.460
<v Speaker 3>It'll be Zinky scale it back to what it</v>
<v Speaker 3>was before,</v>

954
00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:43.880
<v Speaker 3>which that would be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's still national forest still federal</v>

955
00:41:43.881 --> 00:41:46.760
<v Speaker 3>land.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you'd be able to,</v>

956
00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:51.050
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not sure if it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it was wilderness or how the access</v>

957
00:41:51.051 --> 00:41:54.740
<v Speaker 3>would be w,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what Zinky would say is that like I</v>

958
00:41:54.741 --> 00:41:56.540
<v Speaker 3>would be able to go into the land all</v>
<v Speaker 3>the time,</v>

959
00:41:56.750 --> 00:41:59.690
<v Speaker 3>that 2 million acres,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I might be considered by some to</v>

960
00:41:59.691 --> 00:42:00.890
<v Speaker 3>be elite,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

961
00:42:00.891 --> 00:42:04.820
<v Speaker 3>because I can walk for 20 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not Everybody in the United States can</v>

962
00:42:04.821 --> 00:42:07.580
<v Speaker 3>walk 20 miles to get somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they want to put road systems.</v>

963
00:42:07.610 --> 00:42:10.100
<v Speaker 3>There's road systems already,</v>
<v Speaker 3>systems already,</v>

964
00:42:10.101 --> 00:42:12.440
<v Speaker 3>but wants to maintain the roads.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

965
00:42:12.441 --> 00:42:17.060
<v Speaker 3>but if it was a national monument,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right then no road system.</v>

966
00:42:17.061 --> 00:42:20.270
<v Speaker 3>It's like what is the difference that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>think the road systems would be gated</v>

967
00:42:20.271 --> 00:42:24.770
<v Speaker 3>off and it'd be walking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>walking on foot track traffic only</v>

968
00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:27.650
<v Speaker 3>instead of access through the roads.</v>

969
00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:32.630
<v Speaker 3>Now why did Obama make it 2 million</v>
<v Speaker 3>acres and close off the roads?</v>

970
00:42:32.631 --> 00:42:34.350
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's still federal land.</v>

971
00:42:34.351 --> 00:42:39.230
<v Speaker 3>So it's not like the government sold the</v>
<v Speaker 3>land off now and no mining permits have</v>

972
00:42:39.231 --> 00:42:42.650
<v Speaker 3>been issued and there's no plans to</v>
<v Speaker 3>drill or anything like that?</v>

973
00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:43.280
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I,</v>

974
00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:46.340
<v Speaker 3>when I looked that up because I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>unsure about it and I talked with Zinky</v>

975
00:42:46.341 --> 00:42:47.960
<v Speaker 3>about it just because it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

976
00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:52.990
<v Speaker 3>I'm learning all this as we go also.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was concerned when when I read the</v>

977
00:42:54.171 --> 00:42:55.400
<v Speaker 3>president's told your Atlanta,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

978
00:42:55.401 --> 00:42:57.380
<v Speaker 3>what's this about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

979
00:42:57.980 --> 00:42:58.880
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

980
00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:00.600
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what it is is what he,</v>

981
00:43:00.690 --> 00:43:05.690
<v Speaker 3>what zinc he wants to do is he wants to</v>
<v Speaker 3>just make sure people have not all</v>

982
00:43:05.811 --> 00:43:07.760
<v Speaker 3>abilities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause it's not like we want roads on</v>

983
00:43:07.790 --> 00:43:11.990
<v Speaker 3>every mountain but have access to two</v>
<v Speaker 3>national forests.</v>

984
00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:14.810
<v Speaker 3>So people that can drive in four by</v>
<v Speaker 3>fours,</v>

985
00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:18.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those little off unexisting.</v>

986
00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:21.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on existing roads and it's just like</v>

987
00:43:21.291 --> 00:43:23.570
<v Speaker 3>national forest now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>national force now has roads,</v>

988
00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:24.620
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

989
00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:27.770
<v Speaker 3>Designated wilderness areas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because then I talked about that too.</v>

990
00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:28.851
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

991
00:43:28.851 --> 00:43:30.860
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand.</v>

992
00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:32.990
<v Speaker 3>I understand access.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

993
00:43:32.991 --> 00:43:34.820
<v Speaker 3>that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want people to be able to enjoy the</v>

994
00:43:34.821 --> 00:43:38.540
<v Speaker 3>great outdoors also.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I also grew up hunting the Eagle cap</v>

995
00:43:38.541 --> 00:43:41.900
<v Speaker 3>wilderness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is Oregon's largest wilderness</v>

996
00:43:41.901 --> 00:43:44.630
<v Speaker 3>area,</v>
<v Speaker 3>356,000 acres of no roads.</v>

997
00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:49.790
<v Speaker 3>And I don't want roads in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want access in the middle of the</v>

998
00:43:49.791 --> 00:43:52.910
<v Speaker 3>heart of that wilderness because some of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the most pristine,</v>

999
00:43:52.911 --> 00:43:55.730
<v Speaker 3>beautiful country in the lower 48 I like</v>
<v Speaker 3>it like that.</v>

1000
00:43:55.731 --> 00:43:59.570
<v Speaker 3>So we still need to build to protect</v>
<v Speaker 3>those areas.</v>

1001
00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:02.960
<v Speaker 3>But this wasn't in this one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is bears ears and,</v>

1002
00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:05.480
<v Speaker 3>and Utah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This wasn't changing anything,</v>

1003
00:44:05.481 --> 00:44:08.560
<v Speaker 3>opening up anything or this big</v>
<v Speaker 3>nefarious plan of,</v>

1004
00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:11.950
<v Speaker 3>of mining and stripping everything out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

1005
00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:12.860
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were.</v>

1006
00:44:12.861 --> 00:44:15.320
<v Speaker 3>But all I did is they went back to what</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was before.</v>

1007
00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:18.920
<v Speaker 3>And at that time when our research that</v>
<v Speaker 3>there had been no mining permits,</v>

1008
00:44:18.921 --> 00:44:21.420
<v Speaker 3>that from what I understand is there is</v>
<v Speaker 3>no mineral,</v>

1009
00:44:21.470 --> 00:44:23.060
<v Speaker 3>there's not an,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's minerals in there,</v>

1010
00:44:23.061 --> 00:44:28.061
<v Speaker 3>but not enough to warrant going in there</v>
<v Speaker 3>and setting up a full mural extraction</v>

1011
00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:30.350
<v Speaker 3>mine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the building,</v>

1012
00:44:30.351 --> 00:44:32.070
<v Speaker 3>the reason that they changed</v>

1013
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:35.670
<v Speaker 1>the distinction is to allow people to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have more access to that wilderness</v>

1014
00:44:35.671 --> 00:44:37.620
<v Speaker 1>through roads that already exists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't be wilderness.</v>

1015
00:44:37.621 --> 00:44:38.910
<v Speaker 1>It'd be national forest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1016
00:44:38.911 --> 00:44:39.840
<v Speaker 1>The federal lands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1017
00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:42.510
<v Speaker 1>So why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why the uproar then?</v>

1018
00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:45.870
<v Speaker 1>Like why is everybody so confused?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it a lack of communication?</v>

1019
00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:49.680
<v Speaker 1>Is it a lack of understanding about what</v>
<v Speaker 1>the difference in the distinctions of</v>

1020
00:44:49.681 --> 00:44:50.520
<v Speaker 1>the two things are?</v>

1021
00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:51.340
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1022
00:44:51.340 --> 00:44:53.390
<v Speaker 3>it's just creating a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1023
00:44:53.391 --> 00:44:56.040
<v Speaker 3>a negative narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's sane.</v>

1024
00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:58.100
<v Speaker 3>It's something changed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1025
00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:00.340
<v Speaker 3>Obama had at this way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1026
00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:03.500
<v Speaker 3>Zinky scaled it back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that right there.</v>

1027
00:45:03.501 --> 00:45:04.460
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>

1028
00:45:04.490 --> 00:45:07.190
<v Speaker 3>What's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not really doing the research about,</v>

1029
00:45:07.310 --> 00:45:09.560
<v Speaker 3>he's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's just putting it back to what it was</v>

1030
00:45:09.561 --> 00:45:12.350
<v Speaker 3>because he thought that it was an</v>
<v Speaker 3>overreach by Obama.</v>

1031
00:45:12.890 --> 00:45:14.430
<v Speaker 3>So it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1032
00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:15.950
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these outfits,</v>

1033
00:45:15.980 --> 00:45:18.260
<v Speaker 3>they're in business.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1034
00:45:19.490 --> 00:45:20.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if everything's going good,</v>

1035
00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:26.360
<v Speaker 3>there's really no reason for people to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get fired up and contribute money.</v>

1036
00:45:26.750 --> 00:45:27.740
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of these,</v>

1037
00:45:27.950 --> 00:45:30.230
<v Speaker 3>some of these it's political in some</v>
<v Speaker 3>respects,</v>

1038
00:45:30.231 --> 00:45:31.400
<v Speaker 3>businesses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>political.</v>

1039
00:45:31.780 --> 00:45:32.190
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's</v>

1040
00:45:32.190 --> 00:45:33.100
<v Speaker 1>very cynical though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1041
00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:36.270
<v Speaker 1>I see what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that really what's going on</v>

1042
00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:40.480
<v Speaker 1>is people are very concerned and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>see any movement check,</v>

1043
00:45:40.510 --> 00:45:42.660
<v Speaker 1>concern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1044
00:45:42.661 --> 00:45:46.140
<v Speaker 1>But even the businesses like Patagonia's</v>
<v Speaker 1>businesses about the outdoors,</v>

1045
00:45:46.141 --> 00:45:49.370
<v Speaker 1>that's their whole business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they see anything that's changed in</v>

1046
00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:51.030
<v Speaker 1>the trump administration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in,</v>

1047
00:45:51.031 --> 00:45:54.600
<v Speaker 1>in the beginning when it came in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people were really worried about them in</v>

1048
00:45:54.601 --> 00:45:56.560
<v Speaker 1>terms of environmental concerns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1049
00:45:56.580 --> 00:45:58.440
<v Speaker 1>Because they had opened up offshore</v>
<v Speaker 1>drilling.</v>

1050
00:45:58.441 --> 00:46:00.870
<v Speaker 1>They had done a lot of things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people were really freaked out about.</v>

1051
00:46:01.110 --> 00:46:02.910
<v Speaker 1>They had opened up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was the area,</v>

1052
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:08.000
<v Speaker 1>Jamie in Alaska where they were going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>open up drilling that was near a salmon</v>

1053
00:46:09.451 --> 00:46:11.730
<v Speaker 1>runs that people were very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very concerned about.</v>

1054
00:46:12.270 --> 00:46:17.270
<v Speaker 1>They're were concerned about the idea of</v>
<v Speaker 1>money above nature like and then me to</v>

1055
00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:18.840
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And who's making that money?</v>

1056
00:46:18.841 --> 00:46:19.710
<v Speaker 1>You're not making money.</v>

1057
00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:23.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm not making any of that money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So someone else is going to make money</v>

1058
00:46:23.251 --> 00:46:27.480
<v Speaker 1>off of what's supposed to be our land</v>
<v Speaker 1>and our public land,</v>

1059
00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:30.450
<v Speaker 1>which you and I could maybe go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though you don't like salmon,</v>

1060
00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:32.760
<v Speaker 1>we could go salmon fishing in this land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1061
00:46:32.761 --> 00:46:37.620
<v Speaker 1>it could get fucked up by someone else</v>
<v Speaker 1>making billions of dollars in oil or</v>

1062
00:46:37.621 --> 00:46:40.440
<v Speaker 1>natural gas or whatever the fuck we do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they contaminate that.</v>

1063
00:46:40.470 --> 00:46:41.430
<v Speaker 1>I don't want that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1064
00:46:41.431 --> 00:46:42.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want that either.</v>

1065
00:46:42.451 --> 00:46:44.370
<v Speaker 1>And the people from Patagonia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want that either.</v>

1066
00:46:44.490 --> 00:46:46.950
<v Speaker 1>So when they see something like this</v>
<v Speaker 1>come up there,</v>

1067
00:46:46.951 --> 00:46:49.050
<v Speaker 1>red flags go up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to get people outraged.</v>

1068
00:46:49.051 --> 00:46:51.750
<v Speaker 1>They want to get people activated</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they think that they might be a</v>

1069
00:46:51.751 --> 00:46:54.480
<v Speaker 1>chance that if you protest enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can stop something like this</v>

1070
00:46:54.481 --> 00:46:58.410
<v Speaker 1>happening before it does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you do look at like what</v>

1071
00:46:58.411 --> 00:47:02.520
<v Speaker 1>happened in Alaska with that big oil</v>
<v Speaker 1>spill in the 80s or what happened with</v>

1072
00:47:02.521 --> 00:47:05.970
<v Speaker 1>the BP oil spill in the Gulf coast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that shit's devastating.</v>

1073
00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:07.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When something like that does happen,</v>

1074
00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:13.020
<v Speaker 1>someone else is profiting making fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>billions of dollars while our,</v>

1075
00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:16.500
<v Speaker 1>our planet that we all share is getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked up.</v>

1076
00:47:16.530 --> 00:47:19.620
<v Speaker 1>You're not making a nickel off of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not making a nickel off of it.</v>

1077
00:47:19.930 --> 00:47:24.510
<v Speaker 1>They're making billions of dollars and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're fucking up the land and by the</v>

1078
00:47:24.511 --> 00:47:26.430
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by trump or anybody else,</v>

1079
00:47:26.431 --> 00:47:29.680
<v Speaker 1>whoever's opening it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>giving them access to drill,</v>

1080
00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:29.980
<v Speaker 1>right</v>

1081
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:32.770
<v Speaker 2>to do all this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you open up the possibility of ruining</v>

1082
00:47:32.771 --> 00:47:33.760
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>

1083
00:47:33.970 --> 00:47:36.370
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's always going to be a balance</v>

1084
00:47:36.371 --> 00:47:37.030
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

1085
00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:38.890
<v Speaker 2>you can't just say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1086
00:47:38.891 --> 00:47:41.170
<v Speaker 2>nobody can drive past this point</v>
<v Speaker 2>forever.</v>

1087
00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:43.660
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's always so,</v>

1088
00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:45.670
<v Speaker 2>but you're saying that about the Eagle</v>
<v Speaker 2>cap wilderness,</v>

1089
00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:48.070
<v Speaker 2>you don't want them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's gotta be areas,</v>

1090
00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:50.620
<v Speaker 2>there's gotta be areas we have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>protect wilderness areas.</v>

1091
00:47:50.621 --> 00:47:54.190
<v Speaker 2>But for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where we've elk hunting in Colorado,</v>

1092
00:47:54.790 --> 00:47:56.050
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Big Bowls,</v>

1093
00:47:56.051 --> 00:47:59.740
<v Speaker 2>awesome elk hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's natural gas wells all over,</v>

1094
00:48:00.010 --> 00:48:01.120
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>

1095
00:48:01.121 --> 00:48:01.990
<v Speaker 2>Elk Hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1096
00:48:01.991 --> 00:48:03.130
<v Speaker 2>they've got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a bowel.</v>

1097
00:48:03.170 --> 00:48:03.761
<v Speaker 2>They're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1098
00:48:03.761 --> 00:48:05.660
<v Speaker 2>they're not fucking it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

1099
00:48:05.810 --> 00:48:10.810
<v Speaker 2>I don't want things wiped out in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a huge mineral extraction mine where</v>

1100
00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:13.810
<v Speaker 2>there's used to be beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

1101
00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:14.670
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't want that.</v>

1102
00:48:14.670 --> 00:48:17.320
<v Speaker 2>But ever is it a polluted right now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you can't just say,</v>

1103
00:48:17.321 --> 00:48:19.090
<v Speaker 2>we're not doing anything anywhere.</v>

1104
00:48:19.540 --> 00:48:22.000
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there can be a balance just like</v>

1105
00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:24.190
<v Speaker 2>where are we have hunted in Colorado.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There can be a balance,</v>

1106
00:48:24.191 --> 00:48:26.890
<v Speaker 2>but the real concern that the average</v>
<v Speaker 2>person has,</v>

1107
00:48:26.891 --> 00:48:29.530
<v Speaker 2>me included is that someone is going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>profit.</v>

1108
00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:33.820
<v Speaker 2>And by doing that we're where it's not</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to benefit you or anybody.</v>

1109
00:48:33.821 --> 00:48:36.610
<v Speaker 2>We know it's going to fuck it up for</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody else.</v>

1110
00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:38.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the real concern.</v>

1111
00:48:38.250 --> 00:48:39.041
<v Speaker 2>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

1112
00:48:39.041 --> 00:48:41.680
<v Speaker 2>That's why I've tried to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1113
00:48:41.890 --> 00:48:45.520
<v Speaker 2>that's what I've wanted to be involved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm on that council,</v>

1114
00:48:45.521 --> 00:48:48.670
<v Speaker 2>which has nothing to do with public</v>
<v Speaker 2>lands in North America,</v>

1115
00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:51.340
<v Speaker 2>but it's given me a way to get in there</v>
<v Speaker 2>and try to learn more.</v>

1116
00:48:51.370 --> 00:48:54.520
<v Speaker 2>That's all I'm trying to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you also were involved with it when</v>

1117
00:48:54.521 --> 00:48:59.521
<v Speaker 2>Jason Chaffetz had that proposal in Utah</v>
<v Speaker 2>to sell off public land,</v>

1118
00:49:00.130 --> 00:49:03.250
<v Speaker 2>public land.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were one of the people that sat down</v>

1119
00:49:03.251 --> 00:49:05.200
<v Speaker 2>with him and got his take on it.</v>

1120
00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:10.150
<v Speaker 2>And ultimately because the outcry from</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who love the outdoors and hunters</v>

1121
00:49:10.151 --> 00:49:11.770
<v Speaker 2>and fishermen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was stopped.</v>

1122
00:49:11.830 --> 00:49:13.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was very interesting.</v>

1123
00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:15.820
<v Speaker 2>And that Jason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he took a lot of shit,</v>

1124
00:49:15.940 --> 00:49:18.910
<v Speaker 2>but he seems like a very reasonable guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so too.</v>

1125
00:49:18.911 --> 00:49:20.440
<v Speaker 2>It's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1126
00:49:20.441 --> 00:49:22.720
<v Speaker 2>he's out of politics now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is he doing?</v>

1127
00:49:22.750 --> 00:49:24.400
<v Speaker 2>He's on Fox News.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1128
00:49:24.410 --> 00:49:25.900
<v Speaker 2>he's a correspondent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1129
00:49:25.990 --> 00:49:26.801
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's so,</v>

1130
00:49:26.801 --> 00:49:30.070
<v Speaker 2>he's completely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a congressman out of Utah and I</v>

1131
00:49:30.071 --> 00:49:33.130
<v Speaker 2>went back to DC and talk to talk to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was hr six,</v>

1132
00:49:33.131 --> 00:49:38.131
<v Speaker 2>22 and that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they wanted to sell what they determined</v>

1133
00:49:38.201 --> 00:49:40.660
<v Speaker 2>disposable public land.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

1134
00:49:40.661 --> 00:49:41.530
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a second.</v>

1135
00:49:42.370 --> 00:49:45.790
<v Speaker 2>Who says what's disposable?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause what's disposable to you?</v>

1136
00:49:45.791 --> 00:49:48.430
<v Speaker 2>Might not be to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's a great hunting area.</v>

1137
00:49:48.700 --> 00:49:49.810
<v Speaker 2>So I didn't really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1138
00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:53.410
<v Speaker 2>there wasn't really a way to determine</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was disposable.</v>

1139
00:49:53.710 --> 00:49:55.120
<v Speaker 2>That's what caught my attention and</v>
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>

1140
00:49:55.150 --> 00:49:58.630
<v Speaker 2>not just mine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but even people like Steve Rinella in a</v>

1141
00:49:58.631 --> 00:50:02.800
<v Speaker 2>lot of people in a loop and in the know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I got advice from,</v>

1142
00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:04.750
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's see,</v>

1143
00:50:04.751 --> 00:50:07.120
<v Speaker 2>Randy Nuber,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stever Nela,</v>

1144
00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:09.000
<v Speaker 2>Joel Webster at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1145
00:50:09.660 --> 00:50:10.241
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Theater,</v>

1146

<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1147
00:50:11.750 --> 00:50:15.790

<v Speaker 2>All those guys are really experts in the</v>

1148
00:50:15.791 --> 00:50:17.890
<v Speaker 2>field.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Back country hunters and anglers.</v>

1149
00:50:18.420 --> 00:50:21.280
<v Speaker 2>I didn't talk to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did was people were super active,</v>

1150
00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:24.490
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Getting people to complain and protest</v>

1151
00:50:24.491 --> 00:50:26.830
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that one that I did get a chance</v>

1152
00:50:26.831 --> 00:50:28.430
<v Speaker 2>to go back there and I did a podcast</v>

1153
00:50:28.430 --> 00:50:31.640
<v Speaker 3>with a [inaudible] and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he pulled it.</v>

1154
00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:33.050
<v Speaker 3>It was gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Never happen.</v>

1155
00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:33.950
<v Speaker 3>But yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

1156
00:50:34.250 --> 00:50:39.250
<v Speaker 3>I mean we just need to be educated on it</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I just don't like the,</v>

1157
00:50:39.710 --> 00:50:42.800
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dunno without that education jumping,</v>

1158
00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:45.200
<v Speaker 3>jumping in on the bandwagon and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1159
00:50:45.201 --> 00:50:47.870
<v Speaker 3>the president stole my land.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like what is that even true?</v>

1160
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:48.691
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1161
00:50:48.691 --> 00:50:52.020
<v Speaker 1>I always defer to Rinella when it comes</v>
<v Speaker 1>to things like this because he's so well</v>

1162
00:50:52.021 --> 00:50:54.210
<v Speaker 1>versed in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when he said that you're not being</v>

1163
00:50:54.211 --> 00:50:56.640
<v Speaker 1>accurate with your words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to look into it deeper,</v>

1164
00:50:56.641 --> 00:50:58.920
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't really understand it</v>
<v Speaker 1>totally until I was talking to you and</v>

1165
00:50:58.921 --> 00:51:02.730
<v Speaker 1>you were explaining to me the</v>
<v Speaker 1>distinction between how it was before</v>

1166
00:51:02.731 --> 00:51:07.731
<v Speaker 1>Obama was in office at Obama changed and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then bringing it back to how it was</v>

1167
00:51:07.771 --> 00:51:09.570
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's still federal land.</v>

1168
00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:13.230
<v Speaker 1>No one's sold it off and it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just giving people more access to</v>

1169
00:51:13.231 --> 00:51:15.450
<v Speaker 1>roads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but amazing how when something like that</v>

1170
00:51:15.451 --> 00:51:18.810
<v Speaker 1>happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is gigantic outcry and everybody</v>

1171
00:51:18.811 --> 00:51:19.660
<v Speaker 1>freaks out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1172
00:51:19.900 --> 00:51:22.030
<v Speaker 3>It's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's confusing.</v>

1173
00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:25.200
<v Speaker 3>It can be confusing cause I'll read two</v>
<v Speaker 3>different things and I'll be like,</v>

1174
00:51:25.610 --> 00:51:27.880
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is it this or is it that's going</v>

1175
00:51:27.881 --> 00:51:28.750
<v Speaker 3>on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1176
00:51:28.790 --> 00:51:29.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's where I,</v>

1177
00:51:29.980 --> 00:51:30.813
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when people say,</v>

1178
00:51:30.850 --> 00:51:33.370
<v Speaker 3>oh well Zinky he was lying to your face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1179
00:51:33.430 --> 00:51:34.570
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

1180
00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:35.433
<v Speaker 3>maybe</v>

1181
00:51:35.490 --> 00:51:37.480
<v Speaker 1>on video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had doubt it.</v>

1182
00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:39.960
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't seem like that guy.</v>

1183
00:51:40.090 --> 00:51:42.330
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he seems like he's a straight shooter.</v>

1184
00:51:42.380 --> 00:51:43.730
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I asked him about,</v>

1185
00:51:44.210 --> 00:51:49.210
<v Speaker 3>he was getting beat up because the</v>
<v Speaker 3>national parks advisory board wouldn't,</v>

1186
00:51:52.010 --> 00:51:53.690
<v Speaker 3>he wouldn't meet with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it was.</v>

1187
00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:55.100
<v Speaker 3>And so he got said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1188
00:51:55.250 --> 00:51:57.710
<v Speaker 3>Zeke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't care about national parks and</v>

1189
00:51:57.711 --> 00:51:59.420
<v Speaker 3>he won't meet with the advisory board.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1190
00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:02.900
<v Speaker 3>and so I asked him about that because</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was in the news and that was just</v>

1191
00:52:02.901 --> 00:52:03.351
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1192
00:52:03.351 --> 00:52:05.480
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe he doesn't care about public land,</v>

1193
00:52:05.481 --> 00:52:05.991
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1194
00:52:05.991 --> 00:52:09.340
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know what was going on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I wanted to ask them about that.</v>

1195
00:52:09.350 --> 00:52:10.183
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1196
00:52:10.190 --> 00:52:12.830
<v Speaker 3>they resigned in protest because you</v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't meet with him.</v>

1197
00:52:12.831 --> 00:52:13.940
<v Speaker 3>What was that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>

1198
00:52:13.941 --> 00:52:15.260
<v Speaker 3>well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're right.</v>

1199
00:52:15.261 --> 00:52:16.550
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't meet with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

1200
00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:20.870
<v Speaker 3>here's how it went.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I came in as secretary of interior and</v>

1201
00:52:20.871 --> 00:52:22.580
<v Speaker 3>in charge of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how many different</v>

1202
00:52:22.581 --> 00:52:24.560
<v Speaker 3>councils,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like the international one I'm on</v>

1203
00:52:24.561 --> 00:52:27.170
<v Speaker 3>in this park advisory board,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that what we're talking about.</v>

1204
00:52:27.170 --> 00:52:29.300
<v Speaker 3>And there's I think 200 and some that</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

1205
00:52:29.900 --> 00:52:32.180
<v Speaker 3>he really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he over,</v>

1206
00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:36.380
<v Speaker 3>I don't even thousands of employees,</v>
<v Speaker 3>billions of dollars.</v>

1207
00:52:36.740 --> 00:52:39.530
<v Speaker 3>And all he asked was for these advisory</v>
<v Speaker 3>boards.</v>

1208
00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:41.420
<v Speaker 3>He wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1209
00:52:41.540 --> 00:52:45.170
<v Speaker 3>a report written up that said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what have you done in the last two</v>

1210
00:52:45.171 --> 00:52:47.480
<v Speaker 3>years?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you working on now and what's</v>

1211
00:52:47.481 --> 00:52:51.380
<v Speaker 3>your goals for the next two years?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once you provide me with that report,</v>

1212
00:52:51.860 --> 00:52:53.480
<v Speaker 3>then I'll get up to speed and I'll meet</v>
<v Speaker 3>with you.</v>

1213
00:52:53.780 --> 00:52:57.920
<v Speaker 3>They never did it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he didn't meet with them and that was</v>

1214
00:52:57.921 --> 00:52:58.601
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That said,</v>

1215
00:52:58.601 --> 00:53:01.130
<v Speaker 3>the story was he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wouldn't meet with them and they</v>

1216
00:53:01.131 --> 00:53:04.850
<v Speaker 3>resigned in protest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the other half of the story was he</v>

1217
00:53:04.851 --> 00:53:08.480
<v Speaker 3>asked him to do something so he could</v>
<v Speaker 3>get up to speed and be educated on</v>

1218
00:53:08.481 --> 00:53:10.930
<v Speaker 3>what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he never supplied it.</v>

1219
00:53:11.350 --> 00:53:16.350
<v Speaker 1>Well if they are the typical government</v>
<v Speaker 1>employees and what is the typical</v>

1220
00:53:17.531 --> 00:53:19.420
<v Speaker 1>government employee?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Incompetent.</v>

1221
00:53:19.690 --> 00:53:21.280
<v Speaker 1>Lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a government,</v>

1222
00:53:24.070 --> 00:53:26.200
<v Speaker 1>but what are we typical?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1223
00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:28.560
<v Speaker 2>what do people think of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do people think of,</v>

1224
00:53:28.590 --> 00:53:30.480
<v Speaker 2>they think of incompetent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lazy,</v>

1225
00:53:31.620 --> 00:53:35.700
<v Speaker 2>entitled bureaucrats and they've got</v>
<v Speaker 2>this job and like all of a sudden he's</v>

1226
00:53:35.701 --> 00:53:39.750
<v Speaker 2>asking them to provide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just tell them what they've done,</v>

1227
00:53:39.751 --> 00:53:44.430
<v Speaker 2>but tell them what they're going to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>and provide like a framework for the</v>

1228
00:53:44.431 --> 00:53:45.600
<v Speaker 2>future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That makes,</v>

1229
00:53:45.630 --> 00:53:46.710
<v Speaker 2>that's a lot of work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1230
00:53:46.980 --> 00:53:51.570
<v Speaker 2>When someone's a lazy fuck if he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>just kind of half ass in your job,</v>

1231
00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:53.460
<v Speaker 2>it's just showing up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not saying they are.</v>

1232
00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:54.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1233
00:53:54.331 --> 00:53:55.950
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>

1234
00:53:55.951 --> 00:53:59.700
<v Speaker 2>they might have resented him for</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever their preconceived notions of</v>

1235
00:53:59.910 --> 00:54:02.820
<v Speaker 2>who he is coming into this job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they were,</v>

1236
00:54:04.140 --> 00:54:07.110
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if all 12 of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's 12 I don't,</v>

1237
00:54:07.230 --> 00:54:10.530
<v Speaker 2>but I think they were all democrat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh son of a bitches.</v>

1238
00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:12.630
<v Speaker 2>So I mean obviously he's a Republican.</v>

1239
00:54:12.630 --> 00:54:16.110
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's gone unpaid volunteers also unpaid</v>

1240
00:54:16.111 --> 00:54:17.530
<v Speaker 2>run paid volunteers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1241
00:54:17.531 --> 00:54:18.140
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1242
00:54:18.140 --> 00:54:21.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm an unpaid volunteer on that council.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you don't do this for money.</v>

1243
00:54:21.151 --> 00:54:23.040
<v Speaker 2>You do it to make a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1244
00:54:23.041 --> 00:54:25.740
<v Speaker 2>But if they're going to be a volunteer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if there are unpaid volunteer and</v>

1245
00:54:25.741 --> 00:54:28.470
<v Speaker 2>if he asks you to have a plan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should probably have a plan.</v>

1246
00:54:28.471 --> 00:54:29.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise,</v>

1247
00:54:29.461 --> 00:54:30.780
<v Speaker 2>why have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are you doing it?</v>

1248
00:54:30.781 --> 00:54:34.230
<v Speaker 2>Because I guarantee you there's someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>out there that would have a plan.</v>

1249
00:54:34.290 --> 00:54:36.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And especially when it comes to</v>

1250
00:54:36.421 --> 00:54:40.350
<v Speaker 2>something that's important as national</v>
<v Speaker 2>parks and public land,</v>

1251
00:54:40.380 --> 00:54:44.240
<v Speaker 2>things that are like really dear and</v>
<v Speaker 2>important to people is this,</v>

1252
00:54:44.310 --> 00:54:46.440
<v Speaker 2>this is something that you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1253
00:54:46.470 --> 00:54:48.570
<v Speaker 2>you want to have whoever these</v>
<v Speaker 2>volunteers are,</v>

1254
00:54:48.571 --> 00:54:50.970
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to appoint them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to have the best ones for the</v>

1255
00:54:50.971 --> 00:54:51.810
<v Speaker 2>job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1256
00:54:51.870 --> 00:54:54.750
<v Speaker 2>So it's asking someone to write a plan</v>
<v Speaker 2>up and that's,</v>

1257
00:54:54.780 --> 00:54:55.830
<v Speaker 2>if that's the only reason.</v>

1258
00:54:55.830 --> 00:54:58.500
<v Speaker 2>See it's tough because we don't have</v>
<v Speaker 2>their take on it.</v>

1259
00:54:58.830 --> 00:54:59.250
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

1260
00:54:59.250 --> 00:55:01.120
<v Speaker 2>I read what they wrote and what did they</v>
<v Speaker 2>write?</v>

1261
00:55:01.121 --> 00:55:04.160
<v Speaker 2>You just said that he wouldn't meet with</v>
<v Speaker 2>him and whatever.</v>

1262
00:55:04.540 --> 00:55:06.690
<v Speaker 2>So he wouldn't read,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meet with them until they did what he</v>

1263
00:55:06.691 --> 00:55:08.040
<v Speaker 2>asked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't say that.</v>

1264
00:55:08.070 --> 00:55:09.900
<v Speaker 2>He told me that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's what he says.</v>

1265
00:55:10.020 --> 00:55:11.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that makes sense.</v>

1266
00:55:11.820 --> 00:55:13.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1267
00:55:13.530 --> 00:55:15.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of in his camp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>

1268
00:55:15.451 --> 00:55:18.180
<v Speaker 2>if we're looking at it 100% accurately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1269
00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:19.860
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he told me face to face,</v>

1270
00:55:19.861 --> 00:55:21.000
<v Speaker 2>that's what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>

1271
00:55:21.180 --> 00:55:21.991
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can say,</v>

1272
00:55:21.991 --> 00:55:23.100
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe anybody,</v>

1273
00:55:23.190 --> 00:55:25.020
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe what you just told me.</v>

1274
00:55:25.050 --> 00:55:27.150
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe that at some point you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to be like,</v>

1275
00:55:27.270 --> 00:55:29.490
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seemed like he was telling me the</v>

1276
00:55:29.491 --> 00:55:31.530
<v Speaker 2>truth and I believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that makes sense.</v>

1277
00:55:31.770 --> 00:55:32.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1278
00:55:32.130 --> 00:55:34.860
<v Speaker 2>It does make sense that they would not</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to do that,</v>

1279
00:55:35.250 --> 00:55:36.300
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1280
00:55:36.330 --> 00:55:37.540
<v Speaker 2>What have you been working on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1281
00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:39.630
<v Speaker 2>chuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my living room going for his book.</v>

1282
00:55:39.631 --> 00:55:43.710
<v Speaker 2>When I'm at work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes we get pine cones.</v>

1283
00:55:44.590 --> 00:55:46.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>

1284
00:55:46.830 --> 00:55:50.700
<v Speaker 2>to me he seems like hardworking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty demanding.</v>

1285
00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:53.310
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he cares.</v>

1286
00:55:53.550 --> 00:55:55.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's in there trying to,</v>

1287
00:55:56.310 --> 00:55:59.430
<v Speaker 2>so the secretary of interior before the</v>
<v Speaker 2>St key,</v>

1288
00:55:59.580 --> 00:56:00.900
<v Speaker 2>I had no w I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

1289
00:56:00.930 --> 00:56:02.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1290
00:56:02.311 --> 00:56:05.070
<v Speaker 2>so that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what kind of involvement that</v>

1291
00:56:05.071 --> 00:56:09.150
<v Speaker 2>person had in hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the lives of hunting.</v>

1292
00:56:09.180 --> 00:56:12.540
<v Speaker 2>People like me are fishermen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when I didn't even know who it</v>

1293
00:56:12.541 --> 00:56:14.670
<v Speaker 2>wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come to find out her name was sally</v>

1294
00:56:14.671 --> 00:56:18.270
<v Speaker 2>jewel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was Obama's appointee before trump</v>

1295
00:56:18.271 --> 00:56:19.990
<v Speaker 2>appointed zinky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1296
00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:23.040
<v Speaker 2>so I like the fact that zinc,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's at shot show.</v>

1297
00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:24.130
<v Speaker 2>He's had me out</v>

1298
00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:26.950
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm on this council is at least I have a</v>

1299
00:56:26.951 --> 00:56:29.470
<v Speaker 4>seat at the table to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I don't know,</v>

1300
00:56:29.471 --> 00:56:32.890
<v Speaker 4>I might get kicked off this council.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I might never get invited back because</v>

1301
00:56:32.891 --> 00:56:34.960
<v Speaker 4>I'll ask him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so what's going on with this?</v>

1302
00:56:35.260 --> 00:56:37.150
<v Speaker 4>But right now I have a seat at the</v>
<v Speaker 4>table.</v>

1303
00:56:37.300 --> 00:56:39.320
<v Speaker 4>So whatever it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1304
00:56:39.730 --> 00:56:41.290
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I consider that a win.</v>

1305
00:56:41.320 --> 00:56:43.300
<v Speaker 4>At least I can try to find out and</v>
<v Speaker 4>learn.</v>

1306
00:56:43.750 --> 00:56:44.583
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1307
00:56:44.740 --> 00:56:46.690
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's an interesting thing because</v>

1308
00:56:47.410 --> 00:56:50.740
<v Speaker 4>everything that I've heard about him</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I've read in the media,</v>

1309
00:56:50.970 --> 00:56:53.380
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unless I'm reading like a hunting</v>

1310
00:56:53.381 --> 00:56:54.760
<v Speaker 4>website or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1311
00:56:54.790 --> 00:56:58.270
<v Speaker 4>Everything I've heard is like that it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>a horror show that he's bringing on all</v>

1312
00:56:58.271 --> 00:57:03.271
<v Speaker 4>these trophy hunters and there was an</v>
<v Speaker 4>article equating you would being a,</v>

1313
00:57:03.390 --> 00:57:07.620
<v Speaker 4>a trophy hunter and that this council</v>
<v Speaker 4>that he's put together is just this</v>

1314
00:57:07.960 --> 00:57:12.960
<v Speaker 4>disgusting sort of justification for</v>
<v Speaker 4>trophy hunting and that they're only</v>

1315
00:57:13.031 --> 00:57:15.880
<v Speaker 4>putting it together so that wealthy</v>
<v Speaker 4>people can bring back their elephants</v>

1316
00:57:15.881 --> 00:57:16.780
<v Speaker 4>that they shoot in Africa.</v>

1317
00:57:16.840 --> 00:57:17.620
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

1318
00:57:17.620 --> 00:57:19.150
<v Speaker 4>I've read that too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1319
00:57:19.300 --> 00:57:20.500
<v Speaker 4>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm not,</v>

1320
00:57:20.690 --> 00:57:22.240
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never killed an elephant.</v>

1321
00:57:22.241 --> 00:57:24.380
<v Speaker 4>I've never killed a lion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1322
00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:27.340
<v Speaker 4>in every purse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So even the people on the council that</v>

1323
00:57:27.341 --> 00:57:29.800
<v Speaker 4>have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they do care about animals,</v>

1324
00:57:29.830 --> 00:57:32.050
<v Speaker 4>they care.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're volunteers just like on the</v>

1325
00:57:32.060 --> 00:57:36.790
<v Speaker 4>parks advisory board and there they want</v>
<v Speaker 4>to make a positive difference.</v>

1326
00:57:36.850 --> 00:57:38.830
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know every person on that.</v>

1327
00:57:38.860 --> 00:57:42.880
<v Speaker 4>I don't know every person personally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I know they care about the people of</v>

1328
00:57:42.881 --> 00:57:46.600
<v Speaker 4>Africa and that's why they understand</v>
<v Speaker 4>how it works.</v>

1329
00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:48.550
<v Speaker 4>They've been there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've seen it.</v>

1330
00:57:48.670 --> 00:57:51.370
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the guys who I've hunted with,</v>

1331
00:57:51.371 --> 00:57:55.600
<v Speaker 4>their personally awesome people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hardworking people.</v>

1332
00:57:55.890 --> 00:57:56.480
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1333
00:57:56.480 --> 00:57:59.620
<v Speaker 4>the one guy on my last trip there to</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tanzania,</v>

1334
00:58:00.310 --> 00:58:03.580
<v Speaker 4>his daughter was in college and he'd</v>
<v Speaker 4>been a professional hunter over there</v>

1335
00:58:03.581 --> 00:58:08.170
<v Speaker 4>for over 20 or 30 years and she was</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to college now getting their</v>

1336
00:58:08.171 --> 00:58:08.890
<v Speaker 4>degree.</v>

1337
00:58:08.890 --> 00:58:10.960
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>explain with a professional hunter over</v>

1338
00:58:10.961 --> 00:58:12.550
<v Speaker 4>there is not what we think about it over</v>
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>

1339
00:58:12.750 --> 00:58:15.540
<v Speaker 4>When we think of overhear a professional</v>
<v Speaker 4>hunter be a guy hunts.</v>

1340
00:58:15.690 --> 00:58:19.030
<v Speaker 4>Oh that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Essentially a guide,</v>

1341
00:58:19.090 --> 00:58:21.700
<v Speaker 4>a guide.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They call them Ph is or professional</v>

1342
00:58:21.701 --> 00:58:24.970
<v Speaker 4>hunters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I mean because of hunting,</v>

1343
00:58:24.971 --> 00:58:29.050
<v Speaker 4>he's able to send his,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his daughter to college and I mean,</v>

1344
00:58:29.140 --> 00:58:31.200
<v Speaker 4>and now that's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1345
00:58:31.240 --> 00:58:33.510
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'm not saying every person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of them,</v>

1346
00:58:33.560 --> 00:58:37.510
<v Speaker 4>a lot of them and they're not getting</v>
<v Speaker 4>any better because right now,</v>

1347
00:58:37.720 --> 00:58:40.360
<v Speaker 4>so that policy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>trump said,</v>

1348
00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:43.600
<v Speaker 4>well where are we going to review it on</v>
<v Speaker 4>a case by case basis?</v>

1349
00:58:43.630 --> 00:58:46.120
<v Speaker 4>So he didn't say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he didn't say,</v>

1350
00:58:46.210 --> 00:58:48.850
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's legal now everybody can hunt and go</v>

1351
00:58:48.851 --> 00:58:51.280
<v Speaker 4>and bring their trophies back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said we'll review each one on a case</v>

1352
00:58:51.281 --> 00:58:54.580
<v Speaker 4>by case basis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that still doesn't make it that good</v>

1353
00:58:54.581 --> 00:58:55.990
<v Speaker 4>for hunter because they say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1354
00:58:55.991 --> 00:58:58.180
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to book a hunt if I don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>know for a fact.</v>

1355
00:58:58.181 --> 00:58:59.830
<v Speaker 4>I can bring my trophy back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1356
00:59:00.010 --> 00:59:02.020
<v Speaker 4>So it's not really that much better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1357
00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:04.420
<v Speaker 4>what you just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that freaks people out.</v>

1358
00:59:04.421 --> 00:59:06.550
<v Speaker 4>Like trophy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you saying trophy.</v>

1359
00:59:06.551 --> 00:59:08.670
<v Speaker 4>It's an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an animal's life and you got to</v>

1360
00:59:08.671 --> 00:59:09.640
<v Speaker 4>bring it back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1361
00:59:09.641 --> 00:59:13.630
<v Speaker 4>it's that that does,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that distinction is one of the things</v>

1362
00:59:13.631 --> 00:59:15.700
<v Speaker 4>that triggers people well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>trophy.</v>

1363
00:59:15.730 --> 00:59:18.200
<v Speaker 4>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see heads on your wall right here.</v>

1364
00:59:18.201 --> 00:59:19.150
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a trophy.</v>

1365
00:59:19.380 --> 00:59:22.040
<v Speaker 4>But also you ate the meat of that elk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh</v>

1366
00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:25.220
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I mean it's not like you can't be</v>

1367
00:59:25.221 --> 00:59:28.880
<v Speaker 3>both a trophy hunter and hunt for meat</v>
<v Speaker 3>that understand that,</v>

1368
00:59:28.881 --> 00:59:31.970
<v Speaker 3>but most people are not blink bringing</v>
<v Speaker 3>back lion meat.</v>

1369
00:59:32.750 --> 00:59:33.680
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not.</v>

1370
00:59:33.720 --> 00:59:37.220
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's also not mutually exclusive to</v>

1371
00:59:37.221 --> 00:59:40.340
<v Speaker 3>be a trophy hunter and eat the meat or</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the elephants.</v>

1372
00:59:40.820 --> 00:59:42.710
<v Speaker 3>Those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>none of that meat is going to waste on</v>

1373
00:59:42.711 --> 00:59:43.080
<v Speaker 3>an l.</v>

1374
00:59:43.080 --> 00:59:44.390
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it was.</v>

1375
00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:46.950
<v Speaker 1>Don't understand their orphans are</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>

01:00:05.690 --> 01:00:06.790
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they need it.</v>

1385
01:00:06.890 --> 01:00:11.560
<v Speaker 3>And there was a documentary on CNN</v>
<v Speaker 3>recently called trophy and I remember</v>

1386
01:00:11.561 --> 01:00:15.220
<v Speaker 3>there's a scene in there where the</v>
<v Speaker 3>hunter shot an elephant and it wasn't a</v>

1387
01:00:15.221 --> 01:00:18.610
<v Speaker 3>big one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the people were making fun of him</v>

1388
01:00:18.611 --> 01:00:19.870
<v Speaker 3>for shooting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

1389
01:00:19.990 --> 01:00:22.660
<v Speaker 3>he's this small,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they wanted a big elephant with lots of</v>

1390
01:00:22.661 --> 01:00:23.494
<v Speaker 3>meat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1391
01:00:23.530 --> 01:00:24.370
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he,</v>

1392
01:00:24.430 --> 01:00:28.120
<v Speaker 3>he got his quote trophy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They wanted more meat.</v>

1393
01:00:28.150 --> 01:00:30.570
<v Speaker 3>So it was like you can have both and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1394
01:00:30.571 --> 01:00:33.490
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll say trophy hunting because guys</v>

1395
01:00:33.491 --> 01:00:35.320
<v Speaker 3>aren't going over there for the meat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>

1396
01:00:35.410 --> 01:00:37.240
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not why you go to Africa,</v>

1397
01:00:37.750 --> 01:00:41.050
<v Speaker 3>you're going for the trophy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also that the meat isn't going to</v>

1398
01:00:41.051 --> 01:00:41.580
<v Speaker 3>waste.</v>

1399
01:00:41.580 --> 01:00:43.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The meat is going to the villagers.</v>

1400
01:00:43.801 --> 01:00:45.030
<v Speaker 1>It's not like they're going to let it</v>
<v Speaker 1>rot.</v>

1401
01:00:45.330 --> 01:00:47.040
<v Speaker 1>And these people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen it,</v>

1402
01:00:47.130 --> 01:00:48.720
<v Speaker 1>I've seen videos of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

1403
01:00:48.721 --> 01:00:52.470
<v Speaker 1>They show up with baskets on their head</v>
<v Speaker 1>filled with elephant meet and they're</v>

1404
01:00:52.471 --> 01:00:55.140
<v Speaker 1>carrying around like 150 pounds of meat</v>
<v Speaker 1>on their head.</v>

1405
01:00:55.300 --> 01:00:57.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's really nuts when you've</v>

1406
01:00:57.481 --> 01:01:02.481
<v Speaker 1>watched these people just run in and get</v>
<v Speaker 1>chunks of this elephant and they need</v>

1407
01:01:03.421 --> 01:01:03.851
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1408
01:01:03.851 --> 01:01:06.100
<v Speaker 1>it's really important protein for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1409
01:01:06.450 --> 01:01:10.050
<v Speaker 1>The solution is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very complicated.</v>

1410
01:01:10.470 --> 01:01:15.270
<v Speaker 1>Africa is such an enormous place and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>poverty is so intense and the options</v>

1411
01:01:15.271 --> 01:01:18.460
<v Speaker 1>are so limited for these people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

1412
01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:22.860
<v Speaker 1>this is not like a simple like ban the</v>
<v Speaker 1>trophy hunting and the animals will live</v>

1413
01:01:22.861 --> 01:01:24.930
<v Speaker 1>peacefully in the forest to tweet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tweet,</v>

1414
01:01:24.931 --> 01:01:25.764
<v Speaker 1>bird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bird.</v>

1415
01:01:25.830 --> 01:01:27.450
<v Speaker 1>That's not what's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dies.</v>

1416
01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:30.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just that everything over there</v>

1417
01:01:30.301 --> 01:01:31.710
<v Speaker 1>is really complicated.</v>

1418
01:01:31.710 --> 01:01:35.130
<v Speaker 1>And I always tell people to watch the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Louis through documentary.</v>

1419
01:01:35.131 --> 01:01:38.970
<v Speaker 1>He did a thing on this hunting thing in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Africa and he was over there for a long</v>

1420
01:01:38.971 --> 01:01:43.770
<v Speaker 1>time and when he was over there you got</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sense cause he's Louis through is a</v>

1421
01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:45.590
<v Speaker 1>really fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1422
01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:48.640
<v Speaker 1>British documentary guy and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1423
01:01:48.670 --> 01:01:52.740
<v Speaker 1>he asked fantastic questions and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's really polite and he like kind of</v>

1424
01:01:52.741 --> 01:01:55.380
<v Speaker 1>pastors them over and over and over</v>
<v Speaker 1>again until it gets to the heart of the</v>

1425
01:01:55.381 --> 01:01:57.720
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at the end of the documentary you</v>

1426
01:01:57.721 --> 01:02:02.340
<v Speaker 1>realize like this is complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not as simple as hey,</v>

1427
01:02:02.370 --> 01:02:05.550
<v Speaker 1>these mean people want to go over there</v>
<v Speaker 1>and kill animals and treat them as</v>

1428
01:02:05.551 --> 01:02:08.370
<v Speaker 1>objects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole place is kind of,</v>

1429
01:02:08.470 --> 01:02:11.790
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very confused.</v>

1430
01:02:12.180 --> 01:02:13.530
<v Speaker 1>Like it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a mess.</v>

1431
01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:14.080
<v Speaker 1>There's</v>

1432
01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:17.260
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a video right now,</v>

1433
01:02:17.530 --> 01:02:20.580
<v Speaker 3>Jamie could probably find it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but so I think there's three hunters and</v>

1434
01:02:20.581 --> 01:02:21.930
<v Speaker 3>they're over there and I can't remember</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they're,</v>

1435
01:02:21.931 --> 01:02:25.320
<v Speaker 3>they have bows and arrows or spears,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what they do,</v>

1436
01:02:25.321 --> 01:02:30.000
<v Speaker 3>this lion kills an animal for them to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get meat.</v>

1437
01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:35.400
<v Speaker 3>They run in there and chase off the loan</v>
<v Speaker 3>and chase off the lion and steal the</v>

1438
01:02:35.401 --> 01:02:37.950
<v Speaker 3>meat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I seen the cut cut the leg off the,</v>

1439
01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:39.390
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a will to be as a,</v>

1440
01:02:39.391 --> 01:02:42.210
<v Speaker 3>can't remember what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cut the leg off of it and get it out of</v>

1441
01:02:42.211 --> 01:02:46.860
<v Speaker 3>there before the lions because lions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you run out of lion sometimes they'll</v>

1442
01:02:46.861 --> 01:02:47.694
<v Speaker 3>be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoa,</v>

1443
01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:50.730
<v Speaker 3>that's weird and I'll back off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then before they figured out</v>

1444
01:02:50.731 --> 01:02:51.810
<v Speaker 3>there'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait a second,</v>

1445
01:02:52.350 --> 01:02:54.540
<v Speaker 3>I can kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then they'll go in that,</v>

1446
01:02:54.630 --> 01:02:57.840
<v Speaker 3>in that hesitation time they tried to</v>
<v Speaker 3>cut off that link and get out of there.</v>

1447
01:02:58.110 --> 01:03:03.110
<v Speaker 3>So you know when you're here in America</v>
<v Speaker 3>making decisions for people like that,</v>

1448
01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:05.430
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

1449
01:03:05.670 --> 01:03:07.590
<v Speaker 3>I got a problem with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1450
01:03:08.220 --> 01:03:09.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You will,</v>

1451
01:03:09.641 --> 01:03:13.620
<v Speaker 3>you said makes a lot of sense that it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>a first world perspective on a third</v>

1452
01:03:13.621 --> 01:03:17.400
<v Speaker 3>world problem where people are literally</v>
<v Speaker 3>starving to death.</v>

1453
01:03:17.420 --> 01:03:17.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're,</v>

1454
01:03:17.700 --> 01:03:20.820
<v Speaker 3>they're trying to figure out how to get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they need to survive.</v>

1455
01:03:21.030 --> 01:03:24.570
<v Speaker 3>They need protein.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That protein is like gold back there.</v>

1456
01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:26.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's um,</v>

1457
01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:28.290
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is it.</v>

1458
01:03:28.291 --> 01:03:30.360
<v Speaker 3>This is the video and this is on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>discovery channel.</v>

1459
01:03:30.370 --> 01:03:32.860
<v Speaker 3>We can't show it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but these people are running in the</v>

1460
01:03:32.910 --> 01:03:34.260
<v Speaker 3>human planet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you want to watch it,</v>

1461
01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:35.770
<v Speaker 3>I think it's on Netflix or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1462
01:03:35.870 --> 01:03:37.830
<v Speaker 3>A couple of places.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1463
01:03:37.831 --> 01:03:39.940
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty intense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the lions,</v>

1464
01:03:39.970 --> 01:03:41.820
<v Speaker 3>the lions basically covered with blood.</v>

1465
01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:45.480
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they,</v>

1466
01:03:45.481 --> 01:03:49.170
<v Speaker 3>the lions just don't know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They see these people walking out them</v>

1467
01:03:49.171 --> 01:03:52.440
<v Speaker 3>with look like weapons and they just</v>
<v Speaker 3>take a chance and bolt.</v>

1468
01:03:52.441 --> 01:03:55.140
<v Speaker 3>But what a fucking chance that is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1469
01:03:55.530 --> 01:03:56.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they got,</v>

1470
01:03:56.070 --> 01:03:59.550
<v Speaker 3>those are bows and arrows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looks like these things I know</v>

1471
01:03:59.551 --> 01:04:02.190
<v Speaker 3>staring at them and they're super</v>
<v Speaker 3>intense.</v>

1472
01:04:02.220 --> 01:04:03.930
<v Speaker 3>What's that video?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a title Jamie.</v>

1473
01:04:05.180 --> 01:04:06.350
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stealing.</v>

1474
01:04:06.610 --> 01:04:07.980
<v Speaker 3>Stealing meat from lions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1475
01:04:08.100 --> 01:04:09.090
<v Speaker 3>Check it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I mean,</v>

1476
01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:12.050
<v Speaker 3>until I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

1477
01:04:12.051 --> 01:04:14.430
<v Speaker 3>I'm obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not everybody's going to go do this,</v>

1478
01:04:15.090 --> 01:04:18.840
<v Speaker 3>but you need to watch us just to get an</v>
<v Speaker 3>idea of how rough it is.</v>

1479
01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:20.040
<v Speaker 3>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1480
01:04:20.330 --> 01:04:22.110
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the measures I'll take to get some</v>

1481
01:04:22.111 --> 01:04:23.670
<v Speaker 3>protein.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1482
01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:25.980
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that whole Cecil,</v>

1483
01:04:25.981 --> 01:04:30.981
<v Speaker 3>the lion thing just created this uproar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you steal to kill and nobody is hurt,</v>

1484
01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:35.130
<v Speaker 3>that's when you can relax.</v>

1485
01:04:35.390 --> 01:04:36.750
<v Speaker 3>She says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Christ.</v>

1486
01:04:37.140 --> 01:04:37.501
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There,</v>

1487
01:04:37.501 --> 01:04:40.440
<v Speaker 3>it goes to feel happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes with the hindquarter slung over</v>

1488
01:04:40.441 --> 01:04:41.420
<v Speaker 3>their shoulders.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1489
01:04:41.450 --> 01:04:44.100
<v Speaker 3>And he's carried his family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so to me,</v>

1490
01:04:44.101 --> 01:04:48.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hunters are vilified by a large majority</v>

1491
01:04:48.511 --> 01:04:53.511
<v Speaker 3>of the population here was we've said</v>
<v Speaker 3>before nineties 96% of America eats meat</v>

1492
01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:58.080
<v Speaker 3>and hunters are the ones out there</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting to themselves.</v>

1493
01:04:58.081 --> 01:05:00.480
<v Speaker 3>And like I remember that last buck I</v>
<v Speaker 3>killed,</v>

1494
01:05:01.230 --> 01:05:03.660
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Lanai to care.</v>

1495
01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:06.360
<v Speaker 3>I was like meticulous on taking care of</v>
<v Speaker 3>that meat.</v>

1496
01:05:06.361 --> 01:05:07.740
<v Speaker 3>And as I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got it,</v>

1497
01:05:07.741 --> 01:05:10.200
<v Speaker 3>the animal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as I took the bladder out,</v>

1498
01:05:10.260 --> 01:05:15.260
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember how what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like a drop of urine dropped on a</v>

1499
01:05:15.690 --> 01:05:18.160
<v Speaker 3>tiny little piece of the Bacchae Ham.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was just like,</v>

1500
01:05:18.190 --> 01:05:20.890
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was not happy.</v>

1501
01:05:21.100 --> 01:05:23.290
<v Speaker 3>And because that meat is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me,</v>

1502
01:05:23.860 --> 01:05:25.660
<v Speaker 3>it's everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's everything for the hunt.</v>

1503
01:05:25.661 --> 01:05:29.350
<v Speaker 3>And I was so disappointed in myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean obviously the meat's still</v>

1504
01:05:29.351 --> 01:05:30.970
<v Speaker 3>good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that I,</v>

1505
01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:33.610
<v Speaker 3>I want to be perfect when I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I'm taking care of it.</v>

1506
01:05:34.210 --> 01:05:38.200
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's people that eat 96% of people</v>

1507
01:05:38.201 --> 01:05:42.970
<v Speaker 3>eat meat and we throw away what's been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's been figured.</v>

1508
01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:46.240
<v Speaker 3>40% of our food goes in the trash</v>

1509
01:05:46.330 --> 01:05:47.800
<v Speaker 1>waste is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This country.</v>

1510
01:05:47.801 --> 01:05:50.290
<v Speaker 1>And I think Anthony Bordain just did a</v>
<v Speaker 1>documentary on it,</v>

1511
01:05:50.291 --> 01:05:51.940
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's out yet,</v>

1512
01:05:51.970 --> 01:05:54.720
<v Speaker 1>but he did a documentary on food waste.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1513
01:05:54.850 --> 01:05:59.850
<v Speaker 3>I'm worried about one little tiny piece</v>
<v Speaker 3>of me on an animal I killed and people</v>

1514
01:06:00.821 --> 01:06:05.500
<v Speaker 3>who throw away 40% of of what they buy</v>
<v Speaker 3>into the garbage,</v>

1515
01:06:06.010 --> 01:06:07.120
<v Speaker 3>they're judging me.</v>

1516
01:06:07.310 --> 01:06:08.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well there's a lot of that out there,</v>

1517
01:06:08.691 --> 01:06:08.991
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1518
01:06:08.991 --> 01:06:11.210
<v Speaker 1>it's real easy to be negative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1519
01:06:11.211 --> 01:06:12.180
<v Speaker 1>And that's one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1520
01:06:12.410 --> 01:06:15.050
<v Speaker 1>like I said about put up my post about</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lanai.</v>

1521
01:06:15.290 --> 01:06:17.360
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the solid or a couple of negative</v>

1522
01:06:17.361 --> 01:06:17.960
<v Speaker 1>comments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1523
01:06:17.960 --> 01:06:20.540
<v Speaker 1>am I even reading this stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like go have at it folks.</v>

1524
01:06:20.570 --> 01:06:22.040
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just walk away.</v>

1525
01:06:22.130 --> 01:06:23.810
<v Speaker 1>How did you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did you know what they said?</v>

1526
01:06:23.811 --> 01:06:26.030
<v Speaker 1>If he didn't read them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I put it up and I saw it</v>

1527
01:06:26.031 --> 01:06:27.980
<v Speaker 1>immediately afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you read it.</v>

1528
01:06:28.030 --> 01:06:33.030
<v Speaker 1>I read like a half a second of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But my point is that people will be</v>

1529
01:06:34.371 --> 01:06:38.420
<v Speaker 1>negative because it's easy to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause there are douchebags well they</v>

1530
01:06:38.421 --> 01:06:41.900
<v Speaker 1>don't even look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not even thinking it through.</v>

1531
01:06:41.990 --> 01:06:44.330
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're fucking just like</v>
<v Speaker 1>killing animals.</v>

1532
01:06:44.540 --> 01:06:49.540
<v Speaker 1>People like to just make a statement or</v>
<v Speaker 1>get a reaction or push a button or fuck</v>

1533
01:06:50.541 --> 01:06:51.440
<v Speaker 1>with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want,</v>

1534
01:06:51.441 --> 01:06:52.930
<v Speaker 1>they want a reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all it is.</v>

1535
01:06:52.931 --> 01:06:54.890
<v Speaker 1>So you can do one of two things so you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could ignore it.</v>

1536
01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:58.250
<v Speaker 1>You can interact with them and argue</v>
<v Speaker 1>with him back and forth.</v>

1537
01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:01.460
<v Speaker 1>You could block the comments and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>those things are kind of fucked.</v>

1538
01:07:01.570 --> 01:07:02.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just sucks.</v>

1539
01:07:02.890 --> 01:07:03.790
<v Speaker 3>It's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

1540
01:07:03.791 --> 01:07:06.850
<v Speaker 3>I've got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been pretty frustrated.</v>

1541
01:07:07.270 --> 01:07:10.570
<v Speaker 3>I've whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to say I don't read them</v>

1542
01:07:10.571 --> 01:07:13.420
<v Speaker 3>cause obviously I read them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I get frustrated.</v>

1543
01:07:14.830 --> 01:07:17.380
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just hunting.</v>

1544
01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:19.300
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people just don't understand hunting</v>

1545
01:07:19.301 --> 01:07:23.800
<v Speaker 3>because even hunters will say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll say I don't enjoy the kill and I</v>

1546
01:07:23.801 --> 01:07:25.930
<v Speaker 3>don't enjoy the kill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I enjoy,</v>

1547
01:07:26.710 --> 01:07:30.100
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting meat that I can feed my family</v>

1548
01:07:30.110 --> 01:07:30.620
<v Speaker 3>myself.</v>

1549
01:07:30.620 --> 01:07:33.910
<v Speaker 1>You don't enjoy the kill in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually care.</v>

1550
01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:36.080
<v Speaker 1>This is awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it is like,</v>

1551
01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:37.790
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a relief.</v>

1552
01:07:37.910 --> 01:07:40.220
<v Speaker 1>It feels good that your hard work paid</v>
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>

1553
01:07:40.250 --> 01:07:45.250
<v Speaker 1>It feels good that all the ethical</v>
<v Speaker 1>consideration that you put into making a</v>

1554
01:07:45.371 --> 01:07:50.371
<v Speaker 1>perfect shot is all worked out in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of work that's involved in</v>

1555
01:07:50.541 --> 01:07:52.070
<v Speaker 1>making,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1556
01:07:52.071 --> 01:07:54.710
<v Speaker 1>a 70 yard shot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>70 yards,</v>

1557
01:07:54.711 --> 01:07:57.470
<v Speaker 1>a long fucking way to hit an animal</v>
<v Speaker 1>perfectly.</v>

1558
01:07:57.610 --> 01:08:00.920
<v Speaker 1>And then to have it die in seconds and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then to get that meat,</v>

1559
01:08:01.220 --> 01:08:04.340
<v Speaker 1>there's an enjoyment that comes out of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a good feeling,</v>

1560
01:08:04.490 --> 01:08:07.970
<v Speaker 1>but it's not like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not shooting a three pointer at the</v>

1561
01:08:07.971 --> 01:08:11.050
<v Speaker 1>buzzer to win the championships and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's jumping up in the air.</v>

1562
01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:12.110
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not fun.</v>

1563
01:08:12.111 --> 01:08:13.100
<v Speaker 3>People will say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1564
01:08:13.101 --> 01:08:14.990
<v Speaker 3>hunting is killing is fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1565
01:08:15.140 --> 01:08:16.610
<v Speaker 3>it's not fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not for me.</v>

1566
01:08:16.611 --> 01:08:18.620
<v Speaker 3>It's not fun at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1567
01:08:19.030 --> 01:08:21.830
<v Speaker 3>I killed two bucks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>made two perfect shots.</v>

1568
01:08:22.220 --> 01:08:23.370
<v Speaker 3>They went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1569
01:08:24.380 --> 01:08:26.090
<v Speaker 3>not far.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're down in seconds.</v>

1570
01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:29.810
<v Speaker 3>And that was a huge relief to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why I do what I do every single</v>

1571
01:08:29.811 --> 01:08:31.040
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like I said,</v>

1572
01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:36.460
<v Speaker 3>I posted on it to be merciful and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't enjoy when I'm not as perfect as I</v>

1573
01:08:37.791 --> 01:08:40.760
<v Speaker 3>want to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I killed a bull last year in</v>

1574
01:08:40.761 --> 01:08:43.730
<v Speaker 3>Colorado.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was with Johnnie Hamilton,</v>

1575
01:08:43.731 --> 01:08:46.190
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know johnny and he was back cow cone</v>

1576
01:08:46.191 --> 01:08:47.690
<v Speaker 3>here at this bull,</v>
<v Speaker 3>comes up the hill,</v>

1577
01:08:48.260 --> 01:08:53.260
<v Speaker 3>he stops at 15 yards and I hit him</v>
<v Speaker 3>perfect right behind the shoulder.</v>

1578
01:08:53.721 --> 01:08:55.250
<v Speaker 3>It perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He ran down,</v>

1579
01:08:55.251 --> 01:08:57.080
<v Speaker 3>stopped at 30,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hesitated again.</v>

1580
01:08:57.081 --> 01:08:58.610
<v Speaker 3>I already had another arrow on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>

1581
01:08:58.611 --> 01:09:01.280
<v Speaker 3>hit him right beside the first show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first hole.</v>

1582
01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:06.590
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like that bull.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was so convinced he was down and I was</v>

1583
01:09:06.591 --> 01:09:07.680
<v Speaker 3>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh man,</v>

1584
01:09:07.681 --> 01:09:08.750
<v Speaker 3>not that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Felt good.</v>

1585
01:09:08.751 --> 01:09:11.570
<v Speaker 3>Got to in him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>perfect through the lungs.</v>

1586
01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:15.080
<v Speaker 3>He's going to be done in seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't done in seconds.</v>

1587
01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:17.270
<v Speaker 3>And I have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what happened,</v>

1588
01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:19.230
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1589
01:09:19.370 --> 01:09:21.890
<v Speaker 3>whether it was testosterone because he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>coming off the hill,</v>

1590
01:09:21.891 --> 01:09:25.490
<v Speaker 3>he's bugling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was super fired up so I don't know</v>

1591
01:09:25.491 --> 01:09:27.860
<v Speaker 3>what was going on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I ended up,</v>

1592
01:09:28.010 --> 01:09:32.180
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't as quick and kill is what I</v>

1593
01:09:32.181 --> 01:09:35.750
<v Speaker 3>have in my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What a prepare for what I'm happy</v>

1594
01:09:35.751 --> 01:09:39.800
<v Speaker 3>accepting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that in Johnny knows I wasn't happy.</v>

1595
01:09:39.801 --> 01:09:41.990
<v Speaker 3>I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was so disappointed.</v>

1596
01:09:43.190 --> 01:09:45.980
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dunno.</v>

1597
01:09:45.981 --> 01:09:49.700
<v Speaker 3>Maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe 20 minutes,</v>

1598
01:09:49.850 --> 01:09:51.440
<v Speaker 3>20 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

1599
01:09:51.470 --> 01:09:52.400
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

1600
01:09:52.420 --> 01:09:53.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1601
01:09:53.010 --> 01:09:54.260
<v Speaker 3>How's that possible?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1602
01:09:54.890 --> 01:09:56.420
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So tough.</v>

1603
01:09:56.980 --> 01:10:01.460
<v Speaker 3>And that's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I w it really bothered me.</v>

1604
01:10:01.910 --> 01:10:02.743
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1605
01:10:03.230 --> 01:10:03.860
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1606
01:10:03.860 --> 01:10:06.020
<v Speaker 3>it upset me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't,</v>

1607
01:10:06.050 --> 01:10:06.390
<v Speaker 3>I was</v>

1608
01:10:06.390 --> 01:10:08.220
<v Speaker 1>disappointed with myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was disowned.</v>

1609
01:10:08.221 --> 01:10:09.570
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing you could've done</v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

1610
01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:11.010
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1611
01:10:11.060 --> 01:10:12.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you've made a perfect</v>
<v Speaker 1>shot.</v>

1612
01:10:12.980 --> 01:10:15.560
<v Speaker 3>I felt like it was perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

1613
01:10:15.590 --> 01:10:19.040
<v Speaker 3>if it's perfect to animals dead and in</v>
<v Speaker 3>10 seconds,</v>

1614
01:10:19.550 --> 01:10:22.220
<v Speaker 3>so I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when I watched it,</v>

1615
01:10:22.221 --> 01:10:25.190
<v Speaker 3>I've killed a lot of bowls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've went through the process a lot.</v>

1616
01:10:25.550 --> 01:10:28.310
<v Speaker 3>I would take those two shots on any</v>
<v Speaker 3>animal,</v>

1617
01:10:28.311 --> 01:10:32.240
<v Speaker 3>any time and feel a hundred percent</v>
<v Speaker 3>confident he was going to go 50 yards.</v>

1618
01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:33.710
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1619
01:10:33.710 --> 01:10:38.240
<v Speaker 1>this was something that I was really</v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned about when we filmed that</v>

1620
01:10:38.270 --> 01:10:40.040
<v Speaker 1>underarmor hunt in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1621
01:10:40.041 --> 01:10:40.870
<v Speaker 1>Utah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1622
01:10:40.870 --> 01:10:41.511
<v Speaker 1>Cause I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1623
01:10:41.511 --> 01:10:43.790
<v Speaker 1>this is going to be on video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

1624
01:10:43.850 --> 01:10:45.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

1625
01:10:45.150 --> 01:10:46.970
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Big Animal.</v>

1626
01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:47.900
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1627
01:10:47.900 --> 01:10:49.430
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a big deal.</v>

1628
01:10:50.060 --> 01:10:53.180
<v Speaker 1>I want to make sure that this thing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a perfect hit.</v>

1629
01:10:53.270 --> 01:10:53.961
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1630
01:10:53.961 --> 01:10:58.961
<v Speaker 1>and so the feeling of relief that I got</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I saw that it was a perfect pass</v>

1631
01:10:59.361 --> 01:11:03.020
<v Speaker 1>through and that the era that he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>bleeding and po both sides in the exact</v>

1632
01:11:03.021 --> 01:11:06.020
<v Speaker 1>spot I wanted to hit and to watch him</v>
<v Speaker 1>wobble way,</v>

1633
01:11:06.410 --> 01:11:09.350
<v Speaker 1>like an very unsteady legs walked to</v>
<v Speaker 1>about 20,</v>

1634
01:11:09.351 --> 01:11:11.570
<v Speaker 1>30 yards and then tipped over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1635
01:11:12.110 --> 01:11:13.980
<v Speaker 1>That's an amazing of relief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

1636
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:16.210
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't feel good.</v>

1637
01:11:16.211 --> 01:11:17.220
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1638
01:11:17.221 --> 01:11:20.250
<v Speaker 4>it's not fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now there's a feeling of like</v>

1639
01:11:20.940 --> 01:11:24.930
<v Speaker 4>accomplishment but also of remorse and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're tied in together.</v>

1640
01:11:24.950 --> 01:11:26.160
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's uh,</v>

1641
01:11:27.090 --> 01:11:29.700
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and for the animal,</v>

1642
01:11:30.050 --> 01:11:33.090
<v Speaker 4>like with a bow with a perfect shot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1643
01:11:33.150 --> 01:11:35.190
<v Speaker 4>on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on these bucks that I killed,</v>

1644
01:11:35.310 --> 01:11:37.200
<v Speaker 4>they didn't know I was there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it was just,</v>

1645
01:11:37.230 --> 01:11:40.670
<v Speaker 4>I know they didn't feel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't like there's a,</v>

1646
01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:45.030
<v Speaker 4>a rifle report and bone shattering and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're dying from trauma.</v>

1647
01:11:45.031 --> 01:11:47.310
<v Speaker 4>They're dying from hemorrhage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like your bowl that in Utah,</v>

1648
01:11:47.311 --> 01:11:51.120
<v Speaker 4>that took off his legs were wobbly</v>
<v Speaker 4>because of blood pressure.</v>

1649
01:11:51.150 --> 01:11:53.220
<v Speaker 4>He had a blood pressure loss because of</v>
<v Speaker 4>hemorrhage.</v>

1650
01:11:53.550 --> 01:11:55.290
<v Speaker 4>That's not painful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

1651
01:11:55.770 --> 01:11:57.540
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so that's,</v>

1652
01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:01.980
<v Speaker 4>that was a perfect scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what we prepare for and that's,</v>

1653
01:12:02.190 --> 01:12:05.760
<v Speaker 4>that's our goal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when it doesn't work like that,</v>

1654
01:12:05.761 --> 01:12:06.570
<v Speaker 4>that bothers me.</v>

1655
01:12:06.570 --> 01:12:11.570
<v Speaker 4>And so when people chime in on your page</v>
<v Speaker 4>or on my page and these uneducated</v>

1656
01:12:12.841 --> 01:12:17.841
<v Speaker 4>comments trying to turn to tell me how I</v>
<v Speaker 4>feel or why I do what I do,</v>

1657
01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:19.980
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that does not make me happy.</v>

1658
01:12:20.010 --> 01:12:23.250
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I understand it's the ability to</v>

1659
01:12:23.251 --> 01:12:27.420
<v Speaker 4>comment on things is a very strange</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing because the ability to talk to</v>

1660
01:12:27.421 --> 01:12:31.020
<v Speaker 4>people is very different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very difficult to have an audience</v>

1661
01:12:31.230 --> 01:12:33.870
<v Speaker 4>to sit in front of someone that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1662
01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:36.450
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pick a person,</v>

1663
01:12:36.510 --> 01:12:39.300
<v Speaker 4>a famous like Morgan Freeman to sit down</v>
<v Speaker 4>across running.</v>

1664
01:12:39.301 --> 01:12:41.790
<v Speaker 4>And why pick Morgan Freeman?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very hard to,</v>

1665
01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:43.910
<v Speaker 4>it's very hard to be in front of him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1666
01:12:43.950 --> 01:12:47.610
<v Speaker 4>To be able to sit down and talk to</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone and to look them in the eyes.</v>

1667
01:12:47.611 --> 01:12:50.430
<v Speaker 4>You would choose your words properly and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'd have a conversation.</v>

1668
01:12:50.850 --> 01:12:52.710
<v Speaker 4>But if you just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's on your face,</v>

1669
01:12:52.711 --> 01:12:54.050
<v Speaker 4>bro,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you just,</v>

1670
01:12:54.180 --> 01:12:55.770
<v Speaker 4>what's all those black spots on your</v>
<v Speaker 4>face?</v>

1671
01:12:55.770 --> 01:12:58.890
<v Speaker 4>You dumb fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can just put that on twitter and</v>

1672
01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:00.570
<v Speaker 4>it's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's easy.</v>

1673
01:13:01.010 --> 01:13:04.230
<v Speaker 4>And that's so it's a human being</v>
<v Speaker 4>communicating with another human being</v>

1674
01:13:04.231 --> 01:13:07.020
<v Speaker 4>at saying something insulting and it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>so incredibly easy to do.</v>

1675
01:13:07.060 --> 01:13:08.340
<v Speaker 4>It's too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's too easy.</v>

1676
01:13:08.590 --> 01:13:10.920
<v Speaker 4>We think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we don't really understand what we're</v>

1677
01:13:10.921 --> 01:13:12.900
<v Speaker 4>doing with that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when it comes to hunting,</v>

1678
01:13:14.070 --> 01:13:19.070
<v Speaker 4>there's something about the fact that 90</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's 97% actually eat,</v>

1679
01:13:19.441 --> 01:13:24.441
<v Speaker 4>meet somewhere in the range and maybe 3%</v>
<v Speaker 4>do it themselves.</v>

1680
01:13:26.070 --> 01:13:28.770
<v Speaker 4>3% like what do you think it is</v>
<v Speaker 4>nationwide?</v>

1681
01:13:28.771 --> 01:13:31.290
<v Speaker 4>If you had to pick nationwide,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like how many people nationwide,</v>

1682
01:13:31.730 --> 01:13:33.060
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>killed their own food?</v>

1683
01:13:33.780 --> 01:13:35.950
<v Speaker 4>Is it even 5%?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1684
01:13:36.060 --> 01:13:37.110
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well there's,</v>

1685
01:13:37.290 --> 01:13:39.060
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I looked this up because I was</v>

1686
01:13:39.180 --> 01:13:41.130
<v Speaker 4>curious how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how many people I'm reaching on</v>

1687
01:13:41.131 --> 01:13:45.480
<v Speaker 4>instagram?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's 13 million licensed hunters.</v>

1688
01:13:46.980 --> 01:13:47.860
<v Speaker 4>13 million.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How?</v>

1689
01:13:47.861 --> 01:13:49.640
<v Speaker 4>13 million.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many isn't there?</v>

1690
01:13:49.650 --> 01:13:52.230
<v Speaker 4>300 and some how many people are in</v>
<v Speaker 4>America?</v>

1691
01:13:52.231 --> 01:13:55.200
<v Speaker 4>I think it's three 20 is it three 20</v>
<v Speaker 4>somewhere in the range.</v>

1692
01:13:55.201 --> 01:13:56.370
<v Speaker 4>320 million.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1693
01:13:56.371 --> 01:13:59.280
<v Speaker 4>So what does that under 5%?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1694
01:13:59.550 --> 01:14:00.780
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not a lot.</v>

1695
01:14:01.930 --> 01:14:05.700
<v Speaker 4>It's a very small amount.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And how many of them are only eating</v>

1696
01:14:05.701 --> 01:14:07.220
<v Speaker 4>that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many of them are,</v>

1697
01:14:07.260 --> 01:14:12.040
<v Speaker 4>are are spending so much time hunting</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they can live off of the</v>

1698
01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:13.570
<v Speaker 1>meat that they kill themselves?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1699
01:14:13.571 --> 01:14:15.540
<v Speaker 1>Only now it's one,</v>

1700
01:14:15.720 --> 01:14:18.510
<v Speaker 3>maybe 1%.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why even I saw people,</v>

1701
01:14:18.511 --> 01:14:22.950
<v Speaker 3>like we had the picture of your freezer</v>
<v Speaker 3>back here fold filled with meat and</v>

1702
01:14:22.951 --> 01:14:23.910
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1703
01:14:23.911 --> 01:14:26.490
<v Speaker 3>saying you couldn't eat that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I thought you,</v>

1704
01:14:26.491 --> 01:14:28.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just killing what you need to</v>

1705
01:14:28.141 --> 01:14:30.820
<v Speaker 3>eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But so that's just some big,</v>

1706
01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:33.080
<v Speaker 1>those people don't know what the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're talking about.</v>

1707
01:14:33.081 --> 01:14:35.540
<v Speaker 1>I do eat it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I eat all of it and I'll go through that</v>

1710
01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:42.510
<v Speaker 3>That was the key is that I was going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>say is every guest that comes,</v>

1711
01:14:42.511 --> 01:14:45.840

<v Speaker 3>take it on the fucking Mooch.</v>

<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1718
01:14:58.740 --> 01:15:01.140
<v Speaker 3>I thought he ate steaks like all day</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyday.</v>

1719
01:15:01.270 --> 01:15:02.490
<v Speaker 3>If you ask him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'll say he does.</v>

1720
01:15:02.830 --> 01:15:05.790
<v Speaker 3>I eat elk quads,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the,</v>

1722
01:15:06.850 --> 01:15:08.430
<v Speaker 1>top to bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

01:16:48.341 --> 01:16:50.590
<v Speaker 1>he's done with all the cuts and labeled</v>
<v Speaker 1>them all.</v>

1764
01:16:50.591 --> 01:16:54.460

<v Speaker 1>cook each individual cut.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's awesome man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1767
01:16:58.810 --> 01:17:01.870
<v Speaker 1>it makes me feel like I never saw any of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this when I was a kid.</v>

1768
01:17:01.871 --> 01:17:03.550
<v Speaker 1>I grew up in the city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never,</v>

1769
01:17:03.970 --> 01:17:06.370
<v Speaker 1>I used to fish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to eat fish that I caught,</v>

1770
01:17:06.371 --> 01:17:10.160
<v Speaker 1>but I never was involved in hunting at</v>
<v Speaker 1>all until I was in my forties so when</v>

1771
01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:11.420
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1772
01:17:11.421 --> 01:17:16.100
<v Speaker 2>I see comments from people that probably</v>
<v Speaker 2>grew up the way I grew up and they don't</v>

1773
01:17:16.101 --> 01:17:17.290
<v Speaker 2>get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They never,</v>

1774
01:17:17.300 --> 01:17:19.040
<v Speaker 2>they're never involved in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yet they're eating meat.</v>

1775
01:17:19.041 --> 01:17:21.500
<v Speaker 2>And it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's because no one's holding them</v>

1776
01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:24.190
<v Speaker 2>accountable for what they're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it,</v>

1777
01:17:24.191 --> 01:17:25.550
<v Speaker 2>cause it's easy to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1778
01:17:25.551 --> 01:17:27.270
<v Speaker 2>you got a little dirt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want it to load.</v>

1779
01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:30.350
<v Speaker 2>The animal got a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so common.</v>

1780
01:17:30.620 --> 01:17:32.990
<v Speaker 2>So Domino's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine if that's what it meant.</v>

1781
01:17:33.050 --> 01:17:34.700
<v Speaker 2>Like if you have a little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have a little deck,</v>

1782
01:17:34.701 --> 01:17:37.760
<v Speaker 2>you just want to go out and kill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be a lot of death out there.</v>

1783
01:17:37.940 --> 01:17:39.750
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot of the little dicks and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shell.</v>

1784
01:17:39.770 --> 01:17:41.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm just to prove her wrong.</v>

1785
01:17:44.420 --> 01:17:45.800

<v Speaker 2>zoo.</v>

1828
01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:20.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1829
01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:22.610

<v Speaker 2>bad to take pictures of bears.</v>

1830
01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:25.400
<v Speaker 2>It's a real common thing in yellowstone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have real issue with that.</v>

1831
01:19:25.401 --> 01:19:27.140
<v Speaker 2>But people would try and get real close</v>
<v Speaker 2>to bears,</v>

1832
01:19:27.141 --> 01:19:28.130
<v Speaker 2>take selfies with them.</v>

1833
01:19:28.370 --> 01:19:30.530
<v Speaker 2>I've done that before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

01:19:31.010 --> 01:19:33.020

<v Speaker 2>You've done it.</v>

1835
01:19:33.021 --> 01:19:34.430
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>While bear hunting.</v>

1836
01:19:34.670 --> 01:19:37.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you've only done it with black</v>

1837
01:19:37.311 --> 01:19:38.060
<v Speaker 2>bears.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1838
01:19:38.060 --> 01:19:40.140
<v Speaker 2>Like you'd never turn your back on</v>
<v Speaker 2>grizzly like down.</v>

1839
01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:40.420
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1840
01:19:40.420 --> 01:19:40.880

<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1841
01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:43.800

<v Speaker 2>saved.</v>

1842
01:19:43.820 --> 01:19:46.160
<v Speaker 2>I can say a smart at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely not.</v>

1843
01:19:46.180 --> 01:19:47.900
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1844
01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:50.330
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1845
01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:52.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can read bears.</v>

1846
01:19:53.270 --> 01:19:56.360
<v Speaker 2>Bears have a personality or attitude</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like dogs.</v>

1847
01:19:56.390 --> 01:19:58.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's a,</v>

1848
01:19:58.310 --> 01:20:01.700
<v Speaker 2>if there's an aggressive bear coming in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably not going to turn my back and</v>

1849
01:20:01.730 --> 01:20:04.850
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have one dog that I will let my kids</v>

1850
01:20:04.930 --> 01:20:06.530
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My massive,</v>

1851
01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:07.980
<v Speaker 2>my kids could ride that dog.</v>

1852
01:20:08.020 --> 01:20:10.110
<v Speaker 1>They can do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That dog is a loving dog.</v>

1853
01:20:10.140 --> 01:20:11.550
<v Speaker 1>He loves everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1854
01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:13.650
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I have another dog that's a</v>

1855
01:20:13.651 --> 01:20:16.790
<v Speaker 1>Shibu Ino bulldog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't let anybody fuck with him.</v>

1856
01:20:16.820 --> 01:20:18.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the littlest dog too.</v>

1857
01:20:18.061 --> 01:20:20.730
<v Speaker 1>He's an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you like try to get them to get</v>

1858
01:20:20.731 --> 01:20:22.320
<v Speaker 1>up and get out of the house in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>morning,</v>

1859
01:20:22.321 --> 01:20:23.370
<v Speaker 1>he'll growl at you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

1860
01:20:23.371 --> 01:20:25.080
<v Speaker 1>listen motherfucker,</v>

01:20:25.081 --> 01:20:26.250
<v Speaker 1>We'll go outside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1862
01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:28.800
<v Speaker 1>It's taught her well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you ground bitch?</v>

1863
01:20:28.850 --> 01:20:29.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on man.</v>

1864
01:20:30.160 --> 01:20:31.890
<v Speaker 1>Fatty for 14 years.</v>

1865
01:20:31.980 --> 01:20:33.730
<v Speaker 1>go out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just old and it's,</v>

1866
01:20:33.900 --> 01:20:35.470
<v Speaker 1>he's in pain a lot is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1867
01:20:36.060 --> 01:20:37.590
<v Speaker 1>it's really hard for him to get up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the point is,</v>

1868
01:20:38.010 --> 01:20:39.840
<v Speaker 1>the other dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure he's old too,</v>

1869
01:20:40.110 --> 01:20:41.540
<v Speaker 1>but he just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a sweetheart.</v>

1870
01:20:41.570 --> 01:20:44.070
<v Speaker 1>He's got no aggression in him towards</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1871
01:20:44.071 --> 01:20:45.300
<v Speaker 1>He's just a sweet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sweet dog.</v>

1872
01:20:45.540 --> 01:20:47.490
<v Speaker 1>That's just personalities.</v>

1873
01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:50.190
<v Speaker 1>Bears are just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is some bears that are cunts.</v>

1874
01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:51.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's actually,</v>

1875
01:20:51.361 --> 01:20:53.700
<v Speaker 1>there's a petition out there about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1876
01:20:53.880 --> 01:20:55.200
<v Speaker 1>band or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1877
01:20:55.201 --> 01:20:58.260
<v Speaker 1>something about me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it says I took a Selfie of a bear</v>

1878
01:20:58.261 --> 01:21:00.060
<v Speaker 1>then killed it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is false.</v>

1879
01:21:00.570 --> 01:21:04.650
<v Speaker 1>The bearer took a selfie of I did not</v>
<v Speaker 1>kill because it wasn't old enough.</v>

1880
01:21:04.770 --> 01:21:08.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So just to dispel any rumors,</v>

1881
01:21:08.101 --> 01:21:10.350
<v Speaker 1>those petitions are fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1882
01:21:10.380 --> 01:21:13.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't want you to kill bears.</v>

1883
01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:16.890
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't,</v>

1884
01:21:17.010 --> 01:21:20.060
<v Speaker 1>they don't want animals to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't want you to kill animals.</v>

1885
01:21:20.100 --> 01:21:22.410
<v Speaker 1>How do you feel about animals killing</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals?</v>

1886
01:21:22.411 --> 01:21:24.210
<v Speaker 1>Because if you don't want animals to</v>
<v Speaker 1>die,</v>

1887
01:21:24.211 --> 01:21:26.610
<v Speaker 1>one of the best ways to stop that is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>kill bears.</v>

1888
01:21:27.030 --> 01:21:28.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you kill bears,</v>

1889
01:21:28.500 --> 01:21:30.720
<v Speaker 1>they get more angry at you for killing</v>
<v Speaker 1>bears,</v>

1890
01:21:30.750 --> 01:21:34.380
<v Speaker 1>mountain lions and lions than anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

1891
01:21:34.410 --> 01:21:36.360
<v Speaker 1>Maybe elephants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which don't kill anything.</v>

1892
01:21:36.420 --> 01:21:38.490
<v Speaker 1>Total herb herbivores.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They kill people.</v>

1893
01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:42.420
<v Speaker 1>Elephants do occasionally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mostly when people do something stupid</v>

1894
01:21:42.421 --> 01:21:43.440
<v Speaker 1>like fuck with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

1895
01:21:43.441 --> 01:21:44.880
<v Speaker 1>they don't go out of their way to kill</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1896
01:21:44.881 --> 01:21:47.160
<v Speaker 1>I think they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I doubt it.</v>

1897
01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:49.410
<v Speaker 1>I changed me this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they kill people if people are</v>

1898
01:21:49.411 --> 01:21:51.870
<v Speaker 1>just where they want to go and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey asshole,</v>

1899
01:21:51.930 --> 01:21:54.660
<v Speaker 1>that's killing them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about you get away from the</v>

1900
01:21:54.661 --> 01:21:56.790
<v Speaker 1>elephant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know the,</v>

1901
01:21:56.791 --> 01:21:59.250
<v Speaker 1>the problem with that is like if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>grow in crops,</v>

1902
01:21:59.251 --> 01:22:00.990
<v Speaker 1>like we were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the elephant starts eating your</v>

1903
01:22:00.991 --> 01:22:01.950
<v Speaker 1>crops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you like get Outta here.</v>

1904
01:22:01.951 --> 01:22:02.761
<v Speaker 1>And the elephants like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1905
01:22:02.761 --> 01:22:03.770
<v Speaker 1>excuse me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1906
01:22:03.810 --> 01:22:04.860
<v Speaker 1>Stomp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1907
01:22:05.060 --> 01:22:06.000
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a wrap kid.</v>

1908
01:22:06.001 --> 01:22:08.010
<v Speaker 1>Elephants can be aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can,</v>

1909
01:22:08.011 --> 01:22:10.980
<v Speaker 1>but they're also fucked with constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1910
01:22:10.981 --> 01:22:14.340
<v Speaker 1>there's just something to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like elephants.</v>

1911
01:22:14.550 --> 01:22:15.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they'll ever,</v>

1912
01:22:15.750 --> 01:22:16.830
<v Speaker 1>they look awesome.</v>

1913
01:22:16.830 --> 01:22:18.140
<v Speaker 1>They're cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad they're,</v>

1914
01:22:18.260 --> 01:22:20.220
<v Speaker 1>they're real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know they're smart.</v>

1915
01:22:20.460 --> 01:22:23.550
<v Speaker 1>I know they have like tight bonds in</v>
<v Speaker 1>their community and you don't have to</v>

1916
01:22:23.551 --> 01:22:25.200
<v Speaker 1>kill one of those to eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1917
01:22:25.201 --> 01:22:29.010
<v Speaker 1>it's like there's plenty of other</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals to eat is I just,</v>

1918
01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:32.910
<v Speaker 1>but if I was starving to death and I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>living in a place that only had</v>

1919
01:22:32.911 --> 01:22:34.650
<v Speaker 1>elephants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure I'd kill an elephant.</v>

1920
01:22:34.680 --> 01:22:35.161
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1921
01:22:35.161 --> 01:22:38.400
<v Speaker 1>if that was all I had to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our friend Brian Stevens said it tasted</v>

1922
01:22:38.401 --> 01:22:40.410
<v Speaker 1>delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said he ate one in Africa,</v>

1923
01:22:40.530 --> 01:22:41.550
<v Speaker 1>did it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he said it was a,</v>

1924
01:22:41.560 --> 01:22:44.220
<v Speaker 1>is one of the most delicious steaks he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever had in his life.</v>

1925
01:22:44.460 --> 01:22:45.750
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

1926
01:22:45.810 --> 01:22:50.810
<v Speaker 1>Like how is that possible?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Endangered Elephants and tigers kill a</v>

1927
01:22:51.331 --> 01:22:53.340
<v Speaker 1>human.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One human a day in India is growing</v>

1928
01:22:53.341 --> 01:22:55.500
<v Speaker 1>population squeezes habitat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1929
01:22:55.501 --> 01:22:58.140
<v Speaker 1>But this is a crazy situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1930
01:22:58.170 --> 01:23:02.040
<v Speaker 1>India's fucking so overpopulated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a very,</v>

1931
01:23:02.041 --> 01:23:05.230
<v Speaker 1>very small place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is he doing trying to get over that</v>

1932
01:23:05.231 --> 01:23:06.120
<v Speaker 1>fence?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

<v Speaker 2>like any human deaths since 2014 wow.</v>

1934
01:23:10.691 --> 01:23:13.900
<v Speaker 2>So they kill people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>1,000 human deaths in four years,</v>

1935
01:23:13.990 --> 01:23:16.380
<v Speaker 2>whilst tigers have killed 92 people in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same period.</v>

1936
01:23:16.390 --> 01:23:19.730
<v Speaker 2>So elephants kill Weymar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

1937
01:23:19.870 --> 01:23:24.520
<v Speaker 2>That's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At the end of that bear selfie thing,</v>

1938
01:23:24.521 --> 01:23:27.160
<v Speaker 2>it said to other people were killed in</v>
<v Speaker 2>that state in India,</v>

1939
01:23:27.250 --> 01:23:29.410
<v Speaker 2>and they were both trying to take</v>
<v Speaker 2>selfies with elephants.</v>

1940
01:23:29.650 --> 01:23:31.870
<v Speaker 2>Fucking dip shits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One was a kid.</v>

1941
01:23:31.990 --> 01:23:33.850
<v Speaker 2>There's too many people in India.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1942
01:23:33.851 --> 01:23:37.240
<v Speaker 2>India is grossly overpopulated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>India,</v>

1943
01:23:37.241 --> 01:23:39.610
<v Speaker 2>I think is smarter than the United</v>
<v Speaker 2>States.</v>

1944
01:23:39.670 --> 01:23:40.660
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it?</v>

01:23:40.690 --> 01:23:43.630
<v Speaker 2>Like what size is India?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno.</v>

1946
01:23:44.050 --> 01:23:46.510

<v Speaker 2>United States,</v>

1947
01:23:46.511 --> 01:23:49.100
<v Speaker 2>but it has a billion people in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1948
01:23:49.101 --> 01:23:51.370
<v Speaker 2>It's slightly more than one third.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The size.</v>

1949
01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:52.750
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more than one third.</v>

1950
01:23:52.751 --> 01:23:53.584
<v Speaker 2>The size.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1951
01:23:54.580 --> 01:23:56.350
<v Speaker 2>1 billion is a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1952

<v Speaker 2>That's a lot of fucking people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1953
01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:00.580
<v Speaker 2>Triple a we have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the third the size.</v>

1954
01:24:00.670 --> 01:24:03.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No third larger.</v>

1955
01:24:03.460 --> 01:24:04.810
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what you're saying,</v>

1956
01:24:04.811 --> 01:24:06.610
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It says it's slightly more than one</v>

1957

<v Speaker 1>that Kanye said and like he would have</v>

<v Speaker 1>like he would have little kids say it</v>

2075
01:29:25.011 --> 01:29:26.070

<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

2080
01:29:30.601 --> 01:29:33.930
<v Speaker 1>why he cries about hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did he cry about?</v>

2081
01:29:33.931 --> 01:29:35.220
<v Speaker 1>Lions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sea Salt.</v>

2082
01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:37.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why.</v>

2083
01:29:37.141 --> 01:29:41.860
<v Speaker 1>Maybe some medication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes guys take things and it ups</v>

2084
01:29:41.861 --> 01:29:43.830
<v Speaker 1>their estrogen and they just get real</v>
<v Speaker 1>watery.</v>

2085
01:29:45.330 --> 01:29:46.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That cry went to be able to do really</v>

2086
01:29:46.891 --> 01:29:51.480
<v Speaker 1>well that I feel like a bitch sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I cried when conor mcgregor was talking</v>

2087
01:29:51.481 --> 01:29:52.920
<v Speaker 1>about the support he gets from Ireland.</v>

2088
01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:55.770
<v Speaker 1>I had to hold back the tears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you being honest?</v>

2089
01:29:55.890 --> 01:29:58.050
<v Speaker 1>I was paying honest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was interviewing him and he started</v>

2090
01:29:58.051 --> 01:30:00.360
<v Speaker 1>talking about the love I get from these</v>
<v Speaker 1>people from Ireland.</v>

2091
01:30:00.361 --> 01:30:00.751
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

2092
01:30:00.751 --> 01:30:02.430
<v Speaker 1>that must be amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That actually,</v>

2093
01:30:03.270 --> 01:30:03.901
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2094
01:30:03.901 --> 01:30:05.310
<v Speaker 1>I get that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get that.</v>

2095
01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:10.710
<v Speaker 1>That's different than Jimmy though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crying like drumming up stupid stuff for</v>

2096
01:30:10.711 --> 01:30:14.550
<v Speaker 1>Cecil the lion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The lion thing is weird.</v>

2097
01:30:15.010 --> 01:30:16.850
<v Speaker 1>Why don't think it's weird?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2098
01:30:17.010 --> 01:30:20.190
<v Speaker 1>there was a great article that was in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the New York Times in Zimbabwe.</v>

2099
01:30:20.191 --> 01:30:21.670
<v Speaker 1>We don't cry for lions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2100
01:30:21.680 --> 01:30:23.070
<v Speaker 1>It happened right after that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2101
01:30:23.190 --> 01:30:25.860
<v Speaker 1>This guy was talking about his family</v>
<v Speaker 1>members that were killed by lions.</v>

2102
01:30:26.550 --> 01:30:29.190
<v Speaker 1>We have a very idealistic view of what a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lion is,</v>

2103
01:30:29.340 --> 01:30:31.500
<v Speaker 1>and I'm a big fan of lions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd love that.</v>

2104
01:30:31.501 --> 01:30:33.540
<v Speaker 1>They're real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that they exist.</v>

2105
01:30:33.541 --> 01:30:35.100
<v Speaker 1>I love that you can see videos of them.</v>

2106
01:30:35.130 --> 01:30:39.780
<v Speaker 1>One of my favorite documentaries of all</v>
<v Speaker 1>time is it documented called relentless</v>

2107
01:30:39.781 --> 01:30:44.781
<v Speaker 1>enemies and it's about these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this one pack of lions that got a river</v>

2108
01:30:46.231 --> 01:30:51.231
<v Speaker 1>changed its path and they got stranded</v>
<v Speaker 1>on an island and there's one pack of,</v>

2109
01:30:51.541 --> 01:30:56.541
<v Speaker 1>I of lions grew enormous because all</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to hunt is water buffalo.</v>

2110
01:30:57.060 --> 01:30:59.610
<v Speaker 1>So instead of this variety of different</v>
<v Speaker 1>game animals,</v>

2111
01:30:59.611 --> 01:31:02.580
<v Speaker 1>all they have to hunt as these huge 2000</v>
<v Speaker 1>pound animals.</v>

2112
01:31:02.820 --> 01:31:07.820
<v Speaker 1>So they grew jacked like hulk size lines</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the female lions or as big as a</v>

2113
01:31:08.611 --> 01:31:10.140
<v Speaker 1>regular mail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>

2114
01:31:10.200 --> 01:31:14.550
<v Speaker 1>it's all fucking amazing document.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See if he could find some images from</v>

2115
01:31:14.551 --> 01:31:17.730
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way they look is just tracked.</v>

2116
01:31:18.070 --> 01:31:20.640
<v Speaker 1>There's so muscular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're fucking huge.</v>

2117
01:31:20.641 --> 01:31:22.860
<v Speaker 1>Like female lions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>600 lbs.</v>

2118
01:31:23.070 --> 01:31:24.480
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking amazing.</v>

2119
01:31:24.630 --> 01:31:28.890
<v Speaker 1>But the documentary is incredible</v>
<v Speaker 1>because these water buffalo are so big</v>

2120
01:31:28.891 --> 01:31:31.110
<v Speaker 1>and so hard to take out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They need like,</v>

2121
01:31:31.370 --> 01:31:32.203
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Cape Buffalo,</v>

2122
01:31:32.340 --> 01:31:37.230
<v Speaker 1>so they need like six or seven of them</v>
<v Speaker 1>just jump Oh fucking buffalo and drag</v>

2123
01:31:37.231 --> 01:31:39.720
<v Speaker 1>him to the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those things are solid muscle too.</v>

2124
01:31:39.780 --> 01:31:40.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Buffalo.</v>

2125
01:31:40.570 --> 01:31:42.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're giant.</v>

2126
01:31:42.390 --> 01:31:44.010
<v Speaker 1>But because of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this,</v>

2127
01:31:44.070 --> 01:31:48.360
<v Speaker 1>I believe this is over the period,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a short amount of time.</v>

2128
01:31:49.260 --> 01:31:51.330
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And short amount of time that these</v>

2129
01:31:51.331 --> 01:31:53.930
<v Speaker 1>lions have lived on this one island,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they did it.</v>

2130
01:31:53.931 --> 01:31:55.420
<v Speaker 1>A whole documentary about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2131
01:31:55.421 --> 01:32:00.160
<v Speaker 1>as all this on this island or hyenas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cape Buffalo</v>

2132
01:32:00.490 --> 01:32:02.990
<v Speaker 2>and lions and a few birds and</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>

2133
01:32:03.100 --> 01:32:04.360
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When they're neat,</v>

2134
01:32:04.390 --> 01:32:05.890
<v Speaker 2>they don't want to eat hyenas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2135
01:32:06.080 --> 01:32:09.590
<v Speaker 2>Mad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want a hyena steak tastes like awful</v>

<v Speaker 2>Today's great.</v>

2137
01:32:13.300 --> 01:32:15.400
<v Speaker 2>Imagine pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You look at a pig,</v>

2138
01:32:15.401 --> 01:32:16.960

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2139
01:32:17.110 --> 01:32:17.943
<v Speaker 2>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2140
01:32:18.340 --> 01:32:22.300
<v Speaker 2>Wild pig is fucking delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they looked disgusting in Africa.</v>

2141
01:32:22.301 --> 01:32:27.301
<v Speaker 2>They say hyenas are a witches witches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's see.</v>

2142
01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:29.190
<v Speaker 2>Margaret,</v>

<v Speaker 2>that was a whole thing.</v>

2145

<v Speaker 2>an Alpha female has a Dick Remember</v>

<v Speaker 2>it's bigger than anything else.</v>

2148
01:32:41.080 --> 01:32:46.080
<v Speaker 2>So Jimmy Kimmel also made the small</v>
<v Speaker 2>penis reference about hunters.</v>

2149
01:32:46.330 --> 01:32:51.010
<v Speaker 2>What does this Okavango Delta Lions from</v>

2177
01:33:55.971 --> 01:34:00.100
<v Speaker 2>are regular size on this island too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really confusing to biologists.</v>

2178
01:34:00.120 --> 01:34:00.471
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

<v Speaker 2>but here they're trying to take out this</v>

2183
01:34:13.900 --> 01:34:14.561
<v Speaker 2>Cape Buffalo out.</v>

2185
01:34:17.390 --> 01:34:19.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The females are much,</v>

2186
01:34:19.481 --> 01:34:22.630
<v Speaker 2>much larger than a regular female.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty brutal.</v>

2187
01:34:23.230 --> 01:34:24.520
<v Speaker 2>Amen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Evolution.</v>

2188
01:34:24.580 --> 01:34:27.790
<v Speaker 2>It's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shed watching things struggled to</v>

2189
01:34:27.791 --> 01:34:31.360
<v Speaker 2>survive</v>
<v Speaker 2>hard out there for a pimp.</v>

2190
01:34:31.420 --> 01:34:33.190
<v Speaker 2>Death has never pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2191
01:34:33.460 --> 01:34:38.460
<v Speaker 2>but it being the thing is people would</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a really hard time if a person was</v>

2192
01:34:40.211 --> 01:34:42.700
<v Speaker 2>doing any of the things that lions too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2193
01:34:42.701 --> 01:34:45.910
<v Speaker 2>you would think that would be awful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but do you have a hard time with lions</v>

2194
01:34:45.911 --> 01:34:47.350
<v Speaker 2>doing the things at lines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you say?</v>

2195
01:34:47.351 --> 01:34:49.060
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's natural.</v>

2196
01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:50.710
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well do you realize that the only reason</v>

2197
01:34:50.711 --> 01:34:53.530
<v Speaker 2>why people even exist is because people</v>
<v Speaker 2>did.</v>

2198
01:34:53.531 --> 01:34:57.130
<v Speaker 2>When lions do the differences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>humans have compassion.</v>

2199
01:34:57.290 --> 01:34:58.123
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>

2200
01:34:58.370 --> 01:35:00.590
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals,</v>

2201
01:35:01.100 --> 01:35:03.590
<v Speaker 1>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have time for compassion out</v>

2202
01:35:03.591 --> 01:35:04.580
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

2203
01:35:04.581 --> 01:35:06.710
<v Speaker 1>It's a nonexistent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the concept,</v>

2204
01:35:06.890 --> 01:35:10.580
<v Speaker 1>I put up this video on my instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the zebra had just,</v>

2205
01:35:10.780 --> 01:35:13.910
<v Speaker 1>the zebra full had just been dropped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2206
01:35:14.150 --> 01:35:18.560
<v Speaker 1>it was just barely standing wobbly legs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This lion,</v>

2207
01:35:18.590 --> 01:35:21.230
<v Speaker 1>big male lion walks up to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kills it.</v>

2208
01:35:21.231 --> 01:35:24.770
<v Speaker 1>Like it had been alive minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw that video.</v>

2209
01:35:24.860 --> 01:35:26.090
<v Speaker 1>That's life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That bum.</v>

2210
01:35:26.110 --> 01:35:27.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not as much as the one where you,</v>

2211
01:35:27.880 --> 01:35:30.500
<v Speaker 1>you had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was it a moose calf or an elk cap?</v>

2212
01:35:30.510 --> 01:35:31.343
<v Speaker 1>Kath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2213
01:35:31.450 --> 01:35:35.030
<v Speaker 1>eating it alive and it's screaming out</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's mother's just a few feet away</v>

2214
01:35:35.040 --> 01:35:37.910
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure out what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that grizzlies just tearing it</v>

2215
01:35:37.911 --> 01:35:39.020
<v Speaker 1>apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sucked.</v>

2216
01:35:39.080 --> 01:35:42.680
<v Speaker 1>But that's what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't control the populations of</v>

2217
01:35:42.681 --> 01:35:45.050
<v Speaker 1>grizzlies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that happens all the time.</v>

2218
01:35:45.080 --> 01:35:47.400
<v Speaker 1>And even today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now with the,</v>

2219
01:35:47.420 --> 01:35:51.140
<v Speaker 1>just the populations as they exist right</v>
<v Speaker 1>now in places like Alberta,</v>

2220
01:35:51.410 --> 01:35:56.410
<v Speaker 1>they estimate that 50% of all moose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>elk and deer calves are killed or fonts</v>

2221
01:35:57.980 --> 01:36:00.380
<v Speaker 1>or killed by bears.</v>

2222
01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:01.940
<v Speaker 1>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just tear them apart.</v>

2223
01:36:02.080 --> 01:36:02.913
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Half of them.</v>

2224
01:36:03.050 --> 01:36:05.360
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what happened up in British</v>

2225
01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:08.810
<v Speaker 1>Columbia because they did that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did a vote in Vancouver essentially</v>

2226
01:36:09.140 --> 01:36:12.500
<v Speaker 1>to vote on whether grizzly hunting</v>
<v Speaker 1>should be allowed.</v>

2227
01:36:13.220 --> 01:36:14.570
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in the city,</v>

2228
01:36:15.170 --> 01:36:16.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like here,</v>

2229
01:36:16.011 --> 01:36:18.080
<v Speaker 1>don't think there are hardly any</v>
<v Speaker 1>grizzlies left.</v>

2230
01:36:18.740 --> 01:36:20.360
<v Speaker 1>So they said no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the,</v>

2231
01:36:20.361 --> 01:36:21.500
<v Speaker 1>the new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2232
01:36:22.340 --> 01:36:24.500
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember what the political</v>
<v Speaker 1>parties called,</v>

2233
01:36:24.501 --> 01:36:29.150
<v Speaker 1>but the one in control now said grizzly</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting is no longer socially</v>

2234
01:36:29.151 --> 01:36:31.880
<v Speaker 1>acceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they can't hunt them.</v>

2235
01:36:32.150 --> 01:36:33.950
<v Speaker 1>And you'll see what's going to happen</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the,</v>

2236
01:36:34.010 --> 01:36:35.810
<v Speaker 1>with the other animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to have to hunt them,</v>

2237
01:36:35.811 --> 01:36:37.130
<v Speaker 1>but they're gonna hire people to hunt</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

2238
01:36:37.720 --> 01:36:41.690
<v Speaker 1>What happens in those situations is what</v>
<v Speaker 1>happens in California when it comes to</v>

2239
01:36:41.691 --> 01:36:43.370
<v Speaker 1>mountain lions and they still get</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunted,</v>

2240
01:36:43.371 --> 01:36:48.290
<v Speaker 1>but they get hunted in a very hush,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hush way higher assassins to go after</v>

2241
01:36:48.291 --> 01:36:48.830
<v Speaker 1>these lines.</v>

2242
01:36:48.830 --> 01:36:53.270
<v Speaker 1>It kill dogs and cats and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scare the shit out of joggers and that's</v>

2243
01:36:53.271 --> 01:36:54.590
<v Speaker 1>what they're going to have to do to</v>
<v Speaker 1>bears.</v>

2244
01:36:54.950 --> 01:36:59.950
<v Speaker 1>The problem with that hunt vote was the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way it was explained,</v>

2245
01:37:00.260 --> 01:37:04.940
<v Speaker 1>Gritty Bowman did a podcast about it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they were explaining was that it</v>

2246
01:37:04.941 --> 01:37:08.900
<v Speaker 1>was a very small percentage of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that even voted on this.</v>

2247
01:37:08.920 --> 01:37:10.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was like it just a few</v>

2248
01:37:10.820 --> 01:37:14.030
<v Speaker 1>thousand people voted on it and most</v>
<v Speaker 1>people were unaware of the consequences</v>

2249
01:37:14.480 --> 01:37:18.650
<v Speaker 1>that there needs to be a balance of</v>
<v Speaker 1>these bears and these animals.</v>

2250
01:37:19.250 --> 01:37:21.400
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise the animals are going to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>decimated in the bears getting</v>

2251
01:37:21.401 --> 01:37:23.960
<v Speaker 1>encroached on human populations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then on top of that,</v>

2252
01:37:24.740 --> 01:37:27.480
<v Speaker 1>these bears like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

2253
01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:32.520
<v Speaker 1>there's been this whole business of</v>
<v Speaker 1>guiding and outfitting for these bears</v>

2254
01:37:33.081 --> 01:37:37.190
<v Speaker 1>and the biologists are not talking to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people that are actually in the</v>

2255
01:37:37.191 --> 01:37:39.740
<v Speaker 1>woods on the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that the population numbers,</v>

2256
01:37:39.741 --> 01:37:42.710
<v Speaker 1>if you talk to people like my friend</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mike Cochran who lives up there,</v>

2257
01:37:42.711 --> 01:37:45.020
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll tell you there's a lot of bears.</v>

2258
01:37:45.470 --> 01:37:49.610
<v Speaker 1>There's a large population of grizzly</v>
<v Speaker 1>bears and it's very difficult to</v>

2259
01:37:49.611 --> 01:37:53.090
<v Speaker 1>determine what the actual population is</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're not listening to the people</v>

2260
01:37:53.091 --> 01:37:54.650
<v Speaker 1>that are on the ground every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2261
01:37:54.840 --> 01:37:55.673
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2262
01:37:55.830 --> 01:37:57.340
<v Speaker 1>you gotta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta listen to the people that are</v>

2263
01:37:57.420 --> 01:38:00.780
<v Speaker 1>boots on the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the in when you have a vote on something</v>

2264
01:38:00.781 --> 01:38:03.630
<v Speaker 1>like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one's taken into consideration these</v>

2265
01:38:03.631 --> 01:38:05.100
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you're just going bears,</v>

2266
01:38:05.130 --> 01:38:06.720
<v Speaker 1>why would you kill a bear?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're amazing.</v>

2267
01:38:06.820 --> 01:38:07.653
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2268
01:38:07.750 --> 01:38:08.583
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love,</v>

2269
01:38:09.060 --> 01:38:13.170
<v Speaker 1>I love bears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The anthropomorphization of animals is</v>

2270
01:38:13.171 --> 01:38:16.410
<v Speaker 1>one of the more dangerous things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have done with civilization where</v>

2271
01:38:16.411 --> 01:38:19.560
<v Speaker 1>we've decided that animals are like us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're our friends.</v>

2272
01:38:19.561 --> 01:38:21.930
<v Speaker 1>They have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they wear baseball hats and fucking</v>

2273
01:38:22.230 --> 01:38:23.370
<v Speaker 1>ties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>

2274
01:38:23.400 --> 01:38:28.260
<v Speaker 1>It's just weird and we do it from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time kids are little,</v>

2275
01:38:28.350 --> 01:38:30.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you give him a teddy bear and then you</v>

2276
01:38:30.781 --> 01:38:31.850
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you tell them,</v>

2277
01:38:31.851 --> 01:38:33.450
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't kill real bears.</v>

2278
01:38:33.450 --> 01:38:36.090
<v Speaker 1>Do you like real bears are going to kill</v>
<v Speaker 1>you?</v>

2279
01:38:36.091 --> 01:38:37.600
<v Speaker 1>Do you understand what a bear is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2280
01:38:37.890 --> 01:38:39.990
<v Speaker 1>like a bear is that thing with that guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>in India.</v>

2281
01:38:39.991 --> 01:38:41.610
<v Speaker 1>That's it there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a monster.</v>

2282
01:38:41.730 --> 01:38:43.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an awesome monster.</v>

2283
01:38:43.051 --> 01:38:43.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad they're real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2284
01:38:43.960 --> 01:38:47.160
<v Speaker 1>me too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But their meat is delicious.</v>

2285
01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:48.750
<v Speaker 1>It is nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other thing,</v>

2286
01:38:48.751 --> 01:38:51.270
<v Speaker 1>it's like people think that somehow now</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can't eat bears,</v>

2287
01:38:51.390 --> 01:38:53.760
<v Speaker 1>like people get mad at you for killing a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bear,</v>

2288
01:38:54.120 --> 01:38:58.050
<v Speaker 1>but they won't get mad at you for</v>
<v Speaker 1>killing a pig because pigs are ugly.</v>

2289
01:38:58.800 --> 01:39:03.150
<v Speaker 1>Like a wild,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like wild pigs or the one of those one</v>

2290
01:39:03.151 --> 01:39:06.780
<v Speaker 1>animals were vegans and animal rights</v>
<v Speaker 1>activists don't have an answer to.</v>

2291
01:39:06.990 --> 01:39:07.890
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2292
01:39:07.920 --> 01:39:09.870
<v Speaker 1>they really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't like seeing people shooting</v>

2293
01:39:09.871 --> 01:39:12.240
<v Speaker 1>them out of helicopters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't like seeing people hunting</v>

2294
01:39:12.241 --> 01:39:14.160
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you looked at the actual numbers,</v>

2295
01:39:14.161 --> 01:39:17.460
<v Speaker 1>I would love to sit down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have someone from Peta or any animal</v>

2296
01:39:17.461 --> 01:39:22.380
<v Speaker 1>rights activist group sit down with</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who really understands the wild</v>

2297
01:39:22.381 --> 01:39:27.180
<v Speaker 1>pig infestation problem that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>invasive species that doesn't have a</v>

2298
01:39:27.181 --> 01:39:31.530
<v Speaker 1>natural Predator that breeds three to</v>
<v Speaker 1>four times a year and can have as many</v>

2299
01:39:31.531 --> 01:39:36.060
<v Speaker 1>as six to eight pigletts and it's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>litter and they're just s just fucking</v>

2300
01:39:36.061 --> 01:39:39.390
<v Speaker 1>like there's no tomorrow and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>having tons of them and they just</v>

2301
01:39:39.391 --> 01:39:42.330

<v Speaker 1>nuanced objective approach.</v>

2305

<v Speaker 1>They haven't looked at this whole thing.</v>

2327
01:40:44.720 --> 01:40:47.610
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot of cool vegans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of vegans that are</v>

2328
01:40:47.611 --> 01:40:49.540
<v Speaker 1>just super self righteous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like once the,</v>

2329
01:40:49.570 --> 01:40:51.570
<v Speaker 1>once they're on that team,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're super self righteous.</v>

2330
01:40:51.571 --> 01:40:53.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And ask him how much time they have in</v>

2331
01:40:53.381 --> 01:40:54.100
<v Speaker 1>the woods.</v>

2332
01:40:54.100 --> 01:40:57.370
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How much time you have around bears,</v>

2333
01:40:57.640 --> 01:40:59.200
<v Speaker 4>how much time you have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2334
01:40:59.290 --> 01:41:02.500
<v Speaker 4>Got a lot of time in the woods to form</v>
<v Speaker 4>that opinion.</v>

2335
01:41:02.950 --> 01:41:04.720
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you really understand?</v>

2336
01:41:04.780 --> 01:41:06.220
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Come across a bear.</v>

2337
01:41:06.221 --> 01:41:09.870
<v Speaker 4>Tear it apart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A P a cub or a killing?</v>

2338
01:41:10.070 --> 01:41:12.020
<v Speaker 4>A calf elk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2339
01:41:12.160 --> 01:41:13.480
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean constantly.</v>

2340
01:41:13.481 --> 01:41:15.190
<v Speaker 4>I don't even,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I put that up,</v>

2341
01:41:15.220 --> 01:41:17.140
<v Speaker 4>I don't even like to watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a hunter.</v>

2342
01:41:17.200 --> 01:41:20.380
<v Speaker 4>I've killed a lot of animals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't like to watch it,</v>

2343
01:41:20.381 --> 01:41:22.580
<v Speaker 4>but we have to show it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2344
01:41:22.780 --> 01:41:25.870
<v Speaker 4>How do you think they feel about animals</v>
<v Speaker 4>killing animals?</v>

2345
01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:28.180
<v Speaker 4>Do you think they feel it's okay because</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's natural?</v>

2346
01:41:30.250 --> 01:41:33.040
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what they think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but wonder if it's just a convenient</v>

2347
01:41:33.041 --> 01:41:34.970
<v Speaker 4>thing that they just look past la,</v>
<v Speaker 4>la,</v>

2348
01:41:35.320 --> 01:41:36.110
<v Speaker 4>la,</v>
<v Speaker 4>la,</v>

2349
01:41:36.110 --> 01:41:37.990
<v Speaker 4>la.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's probably mostly what it</v>

2350
01:41:37.991 --> 01:41:38.920
<v Speaker 4>is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2351
01:41:38.921 --> 01:41:43.600
<v Speaker 4>because if they really did want to see</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what is more beautiful?</v>

2352
01:41:43.810 --> 01:41:46.570
<v Speaker 4>Well that's objective more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's what's more beautiful.</v>

2353
01:41:46.571 --> 01:41:47.560
<v Speaker 4>A deer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A bear.</v>

2354
01:41:47.740 --> 01:41:49.900
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I do know that one doesn't eat the</v>

2355
01:41:49.901 --> 01:41:52.620
<v Speaker 4>other deers don't eat bears,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

2356
01:41:52.630 --> 01:41:54.730
<v Speaker 4>So it feels like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2357
01:41:54.820 --> 01:41:57.400
<v Speaker 4>If you felt like they were both equally</v>
<v Speaker 4>beautiful,</v>

2358
01:41:57.401 --> 01:41:59.860
<v Speaker 4>you'd want to protect the deer from the</v>
<v Speaker 4>bear.</v>

2359
01:41:59.970 --> 01:42:01.930
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I dunno.</v>

2360
01:42:02.080 --> 01:42:04.750
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As a hunter I people always ask me,</v>

2361
01:42:04.751 --> 01:42:06.730
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do you enjoy hunting them out?</v>

2362
01:42:07.210 --> 01:42:08.200
<v Speaker 4>It's what our,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm hunting.</v>

2363
01:42:08.201 --> 01:42:09.760
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2364
01:42:09.970 --> 01:42:14.620
<v Speaker 4>I respect and I'm drawn to all that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like being close to all the animals.</v>

2365
01:42:14.710 --> 01:42:15.550
<v Speaker 4>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2366
01:42:15.880 --> 01:42:16.990
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't really,</v>

2367
01:42:16.991 --> 01:42:19.930
<v Speaker 4>I can't have a hard time writing them</v>
<v Speaker 4>personally.</v>

2368
01:42:20.230 --> 01:42:22.150
<v Speaker 4>Well for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2369
01:42:23.380 --> 01:42:27.460
<v Speaker 4>I just like the ones that are delicious</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they're all pretty delicious.</v>

2370
01:42:27.490 --> 01:42:30.250
<v Speaker 4>They also that we hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2371
01:42:30.310 --> 01:42:32.830
<v Speaker 4>they had the variety of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just liked the fact too that I'm not</v>

2372
01:42:32.831 --> 01:42:35.020
<v Speaker 4>getting meat from some fucking factory</v>
<v Speaker 4>farm.</v>

2373
01:42:35.440 --> 01:42:38.590
<v Speaker 4>The people that are getting meat from</v>
<v Speaker 4>the store and from Burger King and then</v>

2374
01:42:38.591 --> 01:42:40.600
<v Speaker 4>are still shitting on hunters and</v>
<v Speaker 4>saying,</v>

2375
01:42:40.601 --> 01:42:42.820
<v Speaker 4>you got a little Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you're being silly.</v>

2376
01:42:43.010 --> 01:42:44.740
<v Speaker 4>You're being silly now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>

2377
01:42:44.741 --> 01:42:47.920
<v Speaker 4>but I'm getting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so we've talked about this every single</v>

2378
01:42:47.921 --> 01:42:50.950
<v Speaker 4>time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the number of people reaching out is</v>

2379
01:42:50.951 --> 01:42:55.951
<v Speaker 4>growing exponentially daily on who wants</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be a hunter,</v>

2380
01:42:56.681 --> 01:43:01.570
<v Speaker 4>who wants to provide for themselves and</v>
<v Speaker 4>their family and really sees the draw to</v>

2381
01:43:01.571 --> 01:43:02.404
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that is,</v>

2382
01:43:02.440 --> 01:43:04.150
<v Speaker 4>it's the natural way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

2383
01:43:04.510 --> 01:43:06.510
<v Speaker 4>it's a every day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every week.</v>

2384
01:43:06.511 --> 01:43:11.410
<v Speaker 4>So the concern people have in the raw</v>
<v Speaker 4>real good concern for getting food that</v>

2385
01:43:11.411 --> 01:43:14.560
<v Speaker 4>hasn't been tainted with antibiotics and</v>
<v Speaker 4>hormones.</v>

2386
01:43:14.620 --> 01:43:16.210
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Getting natural food.</v>

2387
01:43:16.211 --> 01:43:20.500
<v Speaker 4>There's no more natural organic food</v>
<v Speaker 4>than an animal that is literally living</v>

2388
01:43:20.501 --> 01:43:23.710
<v Speaker 4>in the wild until you take it out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like they don't even know you're there</v>

2389
01:43:23.980 --> 01:43:27.700
<v Speaker 4>until that Arrow hits some of the most</v>
<v Speaker 4>perfect life up until that time</v>

2390
01:43:27.701 --> 01:43:29.140
<v Speaker 4>generally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's,</v>

2391
01:43:29.141 --> 01:43:30.430
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the,</v>

2392
01:43:30.431 --> 01:43:32.560
<v Speaker 4>it's a way it's meant to be really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

2393
01:43:32.620 --> 01:43:36.280
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>humans have hunted up until very</v>

2394
01:43:36.281 --> 01:43:38.580
<v Speaker 4>recently.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's for,</v>

2395
01:43:38.640 --> 01:43:41.320
<v Speaker 4>for most of our existence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kanye hunting,</v>

2396
01:43:42.610 --> 01:43:43.430
<v Speaker 4>if you just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

2397
01:43:43.430 --> 01:43:45.250
<v Speaker 4>you take anybody hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What'd you take?</v>

2398
01:43:45.251 --> 01:43:48.400
<v Speaker 4>Kanye,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what would you take him bear hunting?</v>

2399
01:43:48.450 --> 01:43:50.980
<v Speaker 4>I'd take him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bear bear is good because,</v>

2400
01:43:51.140 --> 01:43:51.973
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

2401
01:43:52.380 --> 01:43:54.770
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when we bet your first bow hunt was</v>

2402
01:43:54.771 --> 01:43:56.840
<v Speaker 4>bear,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just because it's,</v>

2403
01:43:56.960 --> 01:43:59.380
<v Speaker 4>it's pretty controlled.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of bear.</v>

2404
01:43:59.660 --> 01:44:02.840
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can go on some of these hunts and if</v>

2405
01:44:02.841 --> 01:44:05.420
<v Speaker 4>you went on an axis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>deer hunt for your first hunt would</v>

2406
01:44:05.430 --> 01:44:05.900
<v Speaker 4>quit.</v>

2407
01:44:05.900 --> 01:44:07.070
<v Speaker 4>That's tough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's tough.</v>

2408
01:44:07.250 --> 01:44:10.070
<v Speaker 4>So with bear,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a good first time and then</v>

2409
01:44:10.071 --> 01:44:13.400
<v Speaker 4>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like being able to explain why we're</v>

2410
01:44:13.401 --> 01:44:17.180
<v Speaker 4>bear hunting the bear we're looking for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're looking for the big old mail.</v>

2411
01:44:17.181 --> 01:44:19.580
<v Speaker 4>Here's how you identify it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like being right there.</v>

2412
01:44:19.820 --> 01:44:23.300
<v Speaker 4>So if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I took Kanye hunt hunting,</v>

2413
01:44:23.330 --> 01:44:24.810
<v Speaker 4>it would be bear hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hmm.</v>

2414
01:44:25.790 --> 01:44:28.760
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you think he would be able to do it?</v>

2415
01:44:29.750 --> 01:44:31.460
<v Speaker 4>I don't know him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's,</v>

2416
01:44:31.730 --> 01:44:33.740
<v Speaker 4>he seems crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I dunno,</v>

2417
01:44:34.060 --> 01:44:36.560
<v Speaker 4>it's Connie out there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bear hunting just bought like 300 acres</v>

2418
01:44:36.561 --> 01:44:38.150
<v Speaker 4>in Wyoming,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so maybe he did.</v>

2419
01:44:38.151 --> 01:44:40.220
<v Speaker 4>He and Connie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you bought 300 acres in Wyoming.</v>

2420
01:44:40.221 --> 01:44:42.560
<v Speaker 4>He's probably going to build a sneaker</v>
<v Speaker 4>factory out there.</v>

2421
01:44:43.520 --> 01:44:45.290
<v Speaker 4>That's a good looking country right</v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

2422
01:44:45.320 --> 01:44:46.940
<v Speaker 4>That's gorgeous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

2423
01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.970
<v Speaker 4>Why did he buy 300 acres in Wyoming?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's where he's filming our finishing</v>

2424
01:44:49.971 --> 01:44:50.750
<v Speaker 4>his album right now.</v>

2425
01:44:50.750 --> 01:44:52.490
<v Speaker 4>I think he filmed or recorded part of</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2426
01:44:52.491 --> 01:44:55.360
<v Speaker 4>I would go with the album again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all I'm telling you,</v>

2427
01:44:55.370 --> 01:44:56.600
<v Speaker 4>it's all fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It work for Kanye.</v>

2428
01:44:57.380 --> 01:44:59.330
<v Speaker 4>Tell him the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jimmy.</v>

2429
01:45:00.110 --> 01:45:02.960
<v Speaker 4>Jimmy's got a side job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2430
01:45:03.110 --> 01:45:05.810
<v Speaker 4>he's also apparently building in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>interview he talks about,</v>

2431
01:45:05.811 --> 01:45:07.670
<v Speaker 4>I think he's building some houses or</v>
<v Speaker 4>something out there to,</v>

2432
01:45:07.730 --> 01:45:10.940
<v Speaker 4>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You imagined Kim Kardashians wandering</v>

2433
01:45:10.941 --> 01:45:13.040
<v Speaker 4>around Wyoming.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2434
01:45:13.550 --> 01:45:16.220
<v Speaker 4>that's when people are going to really</v>
<v Speaker 4>want to get rid of the bear population</v>

2435
01:45:16.221 --> 01:45:17.810
<v Speaker 4>cause why am he's got some fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>grizzlies.</v>

2436
01:45:18.100 --> 01:45:21.080
<v Speaker 4>Imagine it's the big grizzly bears take</v>
<v Speaker 4>out the Kardashians.</v>

2437
01:45:21.170 --> 01:45:22.350
<v Speaker 4>Well I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2438
01:45:22.670 --> 01:45:26.330
<v Speaker 4>I think people like she's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I laugh and Jamie,</v>

2439
01:45:26.331 --> 01:45:28.310
<v Speaker 4>that's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That would,</v>

2440
01:45:28.340 --> 01:45:31.130
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>thank you about Wyoming.</v>

2441
01:45:31.150 --> 01:45:32.510
<v Speaker 4>Like goofy stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that's good.</v>

2442
01:45:32.570 --> 01:45:33.740
<v Speaker 4>But he's in Wyoming.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>

2443
01:45:33.741 --> 01:45:36.860
<v Speaker 4>About the album sales go crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2444
01:45:36.920 --> 01:45:39.950
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you like covered her would be fat and</v>

2445
01:45:39.951 --> 01:45:40.784
<v Speaker 4>fun horror movie.</v>

2446
01:45:41.030 --> 01:45:45.590
<v Speaker 4>Send her out there in the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think people like Kanye and I don't</v>

2447
01:45:45.591 --> 01:45:47.520
<v Speaker 4>know about Kim or,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2448
01:45:47.960 --> 01:45:50.900
<v Speaker 4>but man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>archery is a discipline people need.</v>

2449
01:45:51.050 --> 01:45:54.950
<v Speaker 4>So I mean they need some discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think archery can be,</v>

2450
01:45:55.770 --> 01:45:56.870
<v Speaker 4>it can be powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2451
01:45:56.871 --> 01:45:59.240
<v Speaker 4>I had sent you that quote I think</v>
<v Speaker 4>yesterday about,</v>

2452
01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:01.940
<v Speaker 4>there's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's things you do in your life or</v>

2453
01:46:01.941 --> 01:46:04.580
<v Speaker 4>theirs before you did them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And after he did them and there was a</v>

2454
01:46:04.581 --> 01:46:09.170
<v Speaker 4>definitive line right there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think archery can be aligned like that</v>

2455
01:46:09.171 --> 01:46:12.680
<v Speaker 4>where everything was before and now</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything after and it's that powerful.</v>

2456
01:46:13.070 --> 01:46:14.810
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think difficult things are important</v>

2457
01:46:14.811 --> 01:46:16.040
<v Speaker 4>for people to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

2458
01:46:16.041 --> 01:46:18.530
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think challenges are extremely</v>

2459
01:46:18.531 --> 01:46:19.910
<v Speaker 4>important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you don't have a challenge and you're</v>

2460
01:46:19.911 --> 01:46:21.830
<v Speaker 4>like the human mind,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2461
01:46:21.831 --> 01:46:26.450
<v Speaker 4>we were talking about idle time being</v>
<v Speaker 4>the devil's playground,</v>

2462
01:46:26.860 --> 01:46:29.630
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If the human mind needs challenges,</v>

2463
01:46:29.631 --> 01:46:34.631
<v Speaker 4>you need something that's stimulating</v>
<v Speaker 4>and intriguing to you and bow hunting is</v>

2464
01:46:35.391 --> 01:46:37.070
<v Speaker 4>insanely difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Archery,</v>

2465
01:46:37.071 --> 01:46:38.070
<v Speaker 4>forget about bow hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've,</v>

2466
01:46:38.071 --> 01:46:41.900
<v Speaker 4>you just want to eat vegetables all day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Archery is insanely difficult.</v>

2467
01:46:42.260 --> 01:46:44.600
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's something that requires</v>

2468
01:46:44.601 --> 01:46:47.090
<v Speaker 4>concentration on all these different</v>
<v Speaker 4>levels,</v>

2469
01:46:47.300 --> 01:46:50.070
<v Speaker 4>like mental concentration.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to focus on your</v>

2470
01:46:50.070 --> 01:46:53.670
<v Speaker 2>posture and your form and make sure that</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything's right and timing the</v>

2471
01:46:53.880 --> 01:46:58.230
<v Speaker 2>release of this shot is right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All that stuff requires so much of your</v>

2472
01:46:58.231 --> 01:47:02.070
<v Speaker 2>focus and so much thought that it cleans</v>
<v Speaker 2>your mind.</v>

2473
01:47:02.140 --> 01:47:04.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It cleans your mind of all these other</v>

2474
01:47:04.021 --> 01:47:06.240
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the bullshit and the life stress</v>

2475
01:47:06.241 --> 01:47:10.230
<v Speaker 2>goes away when that Arrow flies through</v>
<v Speaker 2>the air and shoot hits that Bullseye.</v>

2476
01:47:10.260 --> 01:47:12.180
<v Speaker 2>Like it feels amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

2477
01:47:12.220 --> 01:47:14.750
<v Speaker 2>that's one I had a lot of respect for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2478
01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:19.200
<v Speaker 2>Ryan Zinky when I went back there to DC</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I took them with a bow back</v>

2479
01:47:19.201 --> 01:47:21.750
<v Speaker 2>there and there's a huge group of people</v>
<v Speaker 2>standing around.</v>

2480
01:47:21.751 --> 01:47:25.530
<v Speaker 2>He's shooting an Arrow at a small target</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a gymnasium.</v>

2481
01:47:26.190 --> 01:47:27.270
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2482
01:47:27.271 --> 01:47:28.890
<v Speaker 2>you're putting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're putting yourself out there</v>

2483
01:47:28.891 --> 01:47:31.620
<v Speaker 2>because there's no guarantee you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be very good with a bow.</v>

2484
01:47:31.650 --> 01:47:33.090
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's doesn't have experience with it,</v>

2485
01:47:33.100 --> 01:47:33.390
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2486
01:47:33.390 --> 01:47:34.051
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2487
01:47:34.051 --> 01:47:35.280
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially now with that bow,</v>

2488
01:47:35.281 --> 01:47:37.770
<v Speaker 2>I think he shot one at the western</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunting expo,</v>

2489
01:47:38.010 --> 01:47:39.760
<v Speaker 2>but I saw him shooting in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the,</v>

2490
01:47:40.020 --> 01:47:41.880
<v Speaker 2>the Arrow was lined up like you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>shooting,</v>

2491
01:47:42.010 --> 01:47:43.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>down schools.</v>

2492
01:47:43.350 --> 01:47:46.650
<v Speaker 2>I instead of with a site,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how they used to do it.</v>

2493
01:47:46.651 --> 01:47:47.461
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a lot of,</v>

2494
01:47:47.461 --> 01:47:49.500
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw some old pictures of Ted nugent.</v>

2495
01:47:49.710 --> 01:47:53.940
<v Speaker 2>He used to shoot a compound bow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the release with without a release.</v>

2496
01:47:54.060 --> 01:47:56.250
<v Speaker 2>Oh without,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I don't know if he used a release,</v>

2497
01:47:56.251 --> 01:47:58.240
<v Speaker 2>but I know that he didn't have a site.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2498
01:47:58.320 --> 01:48:03.180
<v Speaker 2>And he was like looking down the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the shaft of the Arrow like a guy would</v>

2499
01:48:03.181 --> 01:48:04.760
<v Speaker 2>do with a recurve bow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2500
01:48:04.761 --> 01:48:05.780
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's not,</v>

2501
01:48:05.820 --> 01:48:07.530
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's in a good position.</v>

2502
01:48:07.531 --> 01:48:09.900
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that one right there so that,</v>

2503
01:48:09.930 --> 01:48:11.910
<v Speaker 2>that's a little more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a little more,</v>

2504
01:48:12.030 --> 01:48:12.360
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2505
01:48:12.360 --> 01:48:13.520
<v Speaker 2>Well that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a comp.</v>

2506
01:48:13.560 --> 01:48:15.180
<v Speaker 2>Well that's a recurve I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

2507
01:48:15.810 --> 01:48:18.120
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to tell cause you only looking</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the top of the riser.</v>

2508
01:48:18.630 --> 01:48:20.980
<v Speaker 2>But what is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that a recurve or comp?</v>

2509
01:48:21.100 --> 01:48:24.840
<v Speaker 2>And I can't tell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it says that,</v>

2510
01:48:25.970 --> 01:48:28.350
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ted nugent is an irresponsible idiot.</v>

2511
01:48:29.340 --> 01:48:32.110

<v Speaker 2>Too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scared.</v>

2515

<v Speaker 2>that's sorta how you do that.</v>

2516
01:48:42.480 --> 01:48:43.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See like there,</v>

2518
01:48:44.940 --> 01:48:48.510
<v Speaker 2>he's got no side on his boat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just looking down the arrow.</v>

2519
01:48:48.550 --> 01:48:50.180
<v Speaker 2>So that's how he used to hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2520
01:48:50.520 --> 01:48:53.190
<v Speaker 2>He used to shoot with a tiny little</v>
<v Speaker 2>stabilizer,</v>

2521
01:48:53.220 --> 01:48:57.690
<v Speaker 2>no site and shoot instinctive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they switched it up a few years back</v>

2522
01:48:57.691 --> 01:49:00.540
<v Speaker 2>and started shooting with sorry sites,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

2523
01:49:01.260 --> 01:49:03.330
<v Speaker 2>but so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so uh,</v>

01:49:03.600 --> 01:49:07.740
<v Speaker 2>Zinky was there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put himself out there and yeah,</v>

2525
01:49:07.741 --> 01:49:10.110

<v Speaker 2>ricocheted off in the crowd,</v>

<v Speaker 2>that that stuff like that is good for</v>

2530

<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's for sure.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm busy.</v>

2552
01:50:11.680 --> 01:50:13.630
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't keep up with everything.</v>

2553
01:50:13.680 --> 01:50:15.550
<v Speaker 1>Well at plus you're off social media</v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

2554
01:50:15.730 --> 01:50:19.990
<v Speaker 1>while I'm not often,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I posted twice today by bucketing the</v>

2555
01:50:19.991 --> 01:50:21.150
<v Speaker 1>flip phone instead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2556
01:50:21.820 --> 01:50:22.960
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have discipline.</v>

2557
01:50:22.990 --> 01:50:25.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm not like Ari should fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You heard me,</v>

2558
01:50:25.061 --> 01:50:27.250
<v Speaker 1>Ari,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got no fucking discipline.</v>

2559
01:50:27.310 --> 01:50:28.143
<v Speaker 1>Is that right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2560
01:50:28.150 --> 01:50:31.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean he talks about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's lucky if he gets his phone in his</v>

2561
01:50:31.301 --> 01:50:32.770
<v Speaker 1>hand like he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't.</v>

2562
01:50:32.770 --> 01:50:34.240
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be late for everything.</v>

2563
01:50:34.360 --> 01:50:35.920
<v Speaker 1>I'll be like 20 minutes late.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

2564
01:50:35.921 --> 01:50:38.020
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sit down and I can't get off.</v>

2565
01:50:38.021 --> 01:50:38.950
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm powerless.</v>

2566
01:50:39.580 --> 01:50:40.031
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

2567
01:50:40.031 --> 01:50:42.760
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't get that.</v>

2568
01:50:42.850 --> 01:50:46.120
<v Speaker 1>That's not good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do know that not thinking about</v>

2569
01:50:46.121 --> 01:50:48.790
<v Speaker 1>that stuff for three days made me feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

2570
01:50:49.350 --> 01:50:53.050
<v Speaker 1>It's like a cleanse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think ultimately there's a,</v>

2571
01:50:53.110 --> 01:50:57.040
<v Speaker 1>there's a tremendous amount of pressure</v>
<v Speaker 1>and being in the public eye,</v>

2572
01:50:57.580 --> 01:51:01.570
<v Speaker 1>whether you're in the public eye,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on social media or public eye doing a</v>

2573
01:51:01.571 --> 01:51:04.330
<v Speaker 1>podcast or anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for me,</v>

2574
01:51:04.331 --> 01:51:08.860
<v Speaker 1>doing nothing but bow hunting for six</v>
<v Speaker 1>days like was a,</v>

2575
01:51:10.480 --> 01:51:14.740
<v Speaker 1>it was a very difficult release yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In that difficult,</v>

2576
01:51:14.741 --> 01:51:17.050
<v Speaker 1>in a difficult task and not difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2577
01:51:17.080 --> 01:51:18.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I needed to go back to it quickly.</v>

2578
01:51:19.690 --> 01:51:22.330
<v Speaker 1>Difficult in that like bow hunting is</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard to do.</v>

2579
01:51:22.510 --> 01:51:25.990
<v Speaker 1>So in doing that thing and concentrating</v>
<v Speaker 1>on that thing only,</v>

2580
01:51:26.410 --> 01:51:31.210
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't thinking at all about like</v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter or you weren't distracted by</v>

2581
01:51:31.211 --> 01:51:32.500
<v Speaker 1>stupid shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the news.</v>

2582
01:51:32.760 --> 01:51:35.340
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I liked that last day,</v>

2583
01:51:35.610 --> 01:51:36.450
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2584
01:51:36.900 --> 01:51:39.480
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I loved,</v>

2585
01:51:39.540 --> 01:51:42.630
<v Speaker 3>let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I killed a buck earlier in the day.</v>

2586
01:51:43.320 --> 01:51:45.900
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you guys had been on some stocks,</v>

2587
01:51:46.710 --> 01:51:48.990
<v Speaker 3>you came,</v>
<v Speaker 3>drove down,</v>

2588
01:51:49.050 --> 01:51:51.030
<v Speaker 3>loaded the buck up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>took it to Bob,</v>

2589
01:51:51.031 --> 01:51:53.120
<v Speaker 3>the butcher,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then we're,</v>

2590
01:51:53.310 --> 01:51:54.930
<v Speaker 3>so it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think later in the morning,</v>

2591
01:51:54.931 --> 01:51:56.850
<v Speaker 3>normally when it'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2592
01:51:56.860 --> 01:52:01.140
<v Speaker 3>let's go get something to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll regroup and come back in the</v>

2593
01:52:01.140 --> 01:52:02.280
<v Speaker 3>afternoon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you're like,</v>

2594
01:52:02.460 --> 01:52:04.170
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to keep hunting.</v>

2595
01:52:04.230 --> 01:52:07.470
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were just so tunnel vision focused</v>

2596
01:52:07.471 --> 01:52:10.260
<v Speaker 3>on hunting and it was so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2597
01:52:10.590 --> 01:52:13.530
<v Speaker 3>I was so excited.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we were out there and it was getting</v>

2598
01:52:13.531 --> 01:52:18.531
<v Speaker 3>hot by this time and we're just finding</v>
<v Speaker 3>deer glassing dear putting together</v>

2599
01:52:18.751 --> 01:52:20.310
<v Speaker 3>these stocks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2600
01:52:20.360 --> 01:52:23.850
<v Speaker 3>it was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was seriously one of</v>

2601
01:52:25.350 --> 01:52:27.360
<v Speaker 3>sounds stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say the best day of my life.</v>

2602
01:52:27.361 --> 01:52:29.070
<v Speaker 3>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a perfect day for me.</v>

2603
01:52:29.100 --> 01:52:30.210
<v Speaker 3>It was fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

2604
01:52:30.240 --> 01:52:32.490
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you guys went down on that stock,</v>

2605
01:52:33.120 --> 01:52:37.290
<v Speaker 3>you and Alec and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I found that that bedded buck by</v>

2606
01:52:37.291 --> 01:52:38.790
<v Speaker 3>himself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the wide bug,</v>

2607
01:52:38.850 --> 01:52:40.200
<v Speaker 3>and it was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2608
01:52:40.320 --> 01:52:41.153
<v Speaker 3>what a great day.</v>

2609
01:52:41.190 --> 01:52:43.640
<v Speaker 1>It was an awesome day and that's how I</v>
<v Speaker 1>would've done it if my family wasn't</v>

2610
01:52:43.650 --> 01:52:44.940
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have just been doing it all.</v>

2611
01:52:45.350 --> 01:52:46.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to come back.</v>

2612
01:52:46.550 --> 01:52:48.680
<v Speaker 1>I would have just brought some snacks</v>
<v Speaker 1>and water and stayed out.</v>

2613
01:52:48.700 --> 01:52:49.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2614
01:52:49.440 --> 01:52:50.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm just one of their to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2615
01:52:51.320 --> 01:52:53.120
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2616
01:52:53.121 --> 01:52:53.930
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2617
01:52:53.930 --> 01:52:55.350
<v Speaker 1>it's like a cleanse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2618
01:52:55.520 --> 01:52:57.770
<v Speaker 1>There's something about the difficulty</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it,</v>

2619
01:52:57.771 --> 01:53:00.200
<v Speaker 1>especially when I was doing it by</v>
<v Speaker 1>myself.</v>

2620
01:53:01.070 --> 01:53:05.960
<v Speaker 1>There was a time for a while where I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>stocking on this buck by myself without</v>

2621
01:53:05.961 --> 01:53:07.010
<v Speaker 1>Alec,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without anybody.</v>

2622
01:53:07.011 --> 01:53:08.570
<v Speaker 1>And like this is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2623
01:53:08.660 --> 01:53:12.260
<v Speaker 1>it's such a singular focus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You thinking about one thing,</v>

2624
01:53:12.470 --> 01:53:14.810
<v Speaker 1>you just checking the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when checking your range,</v>

2625
01:53:14.930 --> 01:53:17.360
<v Speaker 1>trying to close it on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm putting bushes in between you and</v>

2626
01:53:17.361 --> 01:53:20.270
<v Speaker 1>him so he can't see you creep in trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

2627
01:53:20.271 --> 01:53:24.230
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something about that that's so,</v>

2628
01:53:24.830 --> 01:53:27.890
<v Speaker 1>it's so primal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just resonates with your DNA.</v>

2629
01:53:27.910 --> 01:53:30.470
<v Speaker 1>There's something about it where like</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get,</v>

2630
01:53:30.500 --> 01:53:33.980
<v Speaker 1>if you get one of those animals and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you're eating it,</v>

2631
01:53:33.981 --> 01:53:35.990
<v Speaker 1>you're going to remember that moment</v>
<v Speaker 1>forever.</v>

2632
01:53:36.020 --> 01:53:37.070
<v Speaker 1>You gotta remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2633
01:53:37.080 --> 01:53:40.250
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just like getting something</v>

2634
01:53:40.520 --> 01:53:42.410
<v Speaker 1>from a restaurant or from the grocery</v>
<v Speaker 1>store.</v>

2635
01:53:42.411 --> 01:53:44.500
<v Speaker 1>It's getting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're eating's I've got an action.</v>

2636
01:53:44.710 --> 01:53:46.550
<v Speaker 1>You have a massive connection to it.</v>

2637
01:53:46.850 --> 01:53:47.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

2638
01:53:47.760 --> 01:53:50.450
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I videoed a little bit on that deer I</v>

2639
01:53:50.451 --> 01:53:53.870
<v Speaker 3>killed that day and I put it on my</v>
<v Speaker 3>instagram story,</v>

2640
01:53:53.871 --> 01:53:56.640
<v Speaker 3>just little clips about where I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where the buck was kind of the,</v>

2641
01:53:56.660 --> 01:53:58.910
<v Speaker 3>the strategy taken off my boots and all</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2642
01:53:59.480 --> 01:54:02.600
<v Speaker 3>And so many people sent messages saying</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that was fascinating.</v>

2643
01:54:02.720 --> 01:54:04.520
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2644
01:54:04.560 --> 01:54:05.393
<v Speaker 3>does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2645
01:54:05.480 --> 01:54:07.610
<v Speaker 3>how long does the instagram stories stay</v>
<v Speaker 3>up?</v>

2646
01:54:08.420 --> 01:54:11.210
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I saved it on the highlights.</v>

2647
01:54:11.580 --> 01:54:12.830
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that when you saved.</v>

2648
01:54:12.880 --> 01:54:15.440
<v Speaker 3>So is it listed under,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it says access stock.</v>

2649
01:54:15.560 --> 01:54:16.580
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's bad house.</v>

2650
01:54:16.640 --> 01:54:17.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>

2651
01:54:17.390 --> 01:54:19.220
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people can check it out and it's just</v>

2652
01:54:19.221 --> 01:54:21.470
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was reading the comments and seeing</v>

2653
01:54:21.480 --> 01:54:24.830
<v Speaker 3>and reading the messages and people</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying how fascinating it was and it,</v>

2654
01:54:24.831 --> 01:54:28.880
<v Speaker 3>how educational and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on one hand I'm like,</v>

2655
01:54:28.881 --> 01:54:30.500
<v Speaker 3>that's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>On another hand,</v>

2656
01:54:30.501 --> 01:54:33.350
<v Speaker 3>it made me feel bad for him because</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's just,</v>

2657
01:54:33.980 --> 01:54:35.600
<v Speaker 3>I've done that so many times.</v>

2658
01:54:35.870 --> 01:54:37.570
<v Speaker 3>And it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2659
01:54:37.571 --> 01:54:40.520
<v Speaker 3>it's powerful and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it feels like the way it should be.</v>

2660
01:54:40.700 --> 01:54:42.860
<v Speaker 3>But I feel bad for people who haven't</v>
<v Speaker 3>experienced that.</v>

2661
01:54:43.080 --> 01:54:46.190
<v Speaker 3>So I feel good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now that you're in that and that,</v>

2662
01:54:46.191 --> 01:54:47.630
<v Speaker 3>but the people sending you messages,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2663
01:54:47.631 --> 01:54:51.410
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would love to almost be able to share</v>

2664
01:54:51.411 --> 01:54:54.650
<v Speaker 3>that with them somehow or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or I mean that's as good as I can do</v>

2665
01:54:54.651 --> 01:54:56.510
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the hardest things for</v>

2666
01:54:56.511 --> 01:54:59.600
<v Speaker 3>people's to get in it to get started.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2667
01:54:59.650 --> 01:55:03.410
<v Speaker 3>Cause it's like the learning curve.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I was gonna ask you is,</v>

2668
01:55:03.411 --> 01:55:05.960
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had been bow hunting now.</v>

2669
01:55:05.990 --> 01:55:08.780
<v Speaker 3>What was that first bow hunt we went on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What year was that?</v>

2670
01:55:09.260 --> 01:55:14.260
<v Speaker 3>2013 or 1414 so four years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

2671
01:55:17.480 --> 01:55:18.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2672
01:55:18.741 --> 01:55:22.360
<v Speaker 3>So for years and it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>

2673
01:55:22.420 --> 01:55:23.930
<v Speaker 3>it's what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

2674
01:55:24.410 --> 01:55:28.190
<v Speaker 3>what's changed from that first year to</v>
<v Speaker 3>this year for you?</v>

2675
01:55:28.191 --> 01:55:29.024
<v Speaker 3>I mean</v>

2676
01:55:29.270 --> 01:55:30.990
<v Speaker 1>experience for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2677
01:55:31.040 --> 01:55:34.970
<v Speaker 1>Having more hunts under my belt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding how little I really know.</v>

2678
01:55:35.180 --> 01:55:36.320
<v Speaker 1>It's like one of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>

2679
01:55:36.321 --> 01:55:40.970
<v Speaker 1>there's a great expression I think from</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dennis Mckenna that once the,</v>

2680
01:55:41.570 --> 01:55:44.790
<v Speaker 1>the bonfire of understanding</v>

2681
01:55:44.790 --> 01:55:48.390
<v Speaker 4>grows,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the surface area of ignorance is</v>

2682
01:55:48.391 --> 01:55:51.450
<v Speaker 4>revealed is that the bigger the bonfire,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the more you realize,</v>

2683
01:55:51.460 --> 01:55:54.480
<v Speaker 4>like the more you understand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the more you realize how much there is</v>

2684
01:55:54.481 --> 01:55:57.060
<v Speaker 4>to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's one of the things about hunting</v>

2685
01:55:57.061 --> 01:56:00.300
<v Speaker 4>with each experience,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially something like Lanai,</v>

2686
01:56:00.301 --> 01:56:05.301
<v Speaker 4>which is so it's so difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like the most difficult.</v>

2687
01:56:05.760 --> 01:56:08.820
<v Speaker 4>But I mean at least what I've</v>
<v Speaker 4>experienced in my short amount of time</v>

2688
01:56:08.821 --> 01:56:11.880
<v Speaker 4>doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the most difficult kind of hunting spot</v>

2689
01:56:11.881 --> 01:56:14.700
<v Speaker 4>and stocking things that are just</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking wired,</v>

2690
01:56:15.060 --> 01:56:18.570
<v Speaker 4>super pressured.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The stock is the most difficult.</v>

2691
01:56:18.630 --> 01:56:20.250
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean if you,</v>

2692
01:56:20.310 --> 01:56:22.020
<v Speaker 4>if you have to backpack in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>mountains.</v>

2693
01:56:22.380 --> 01:56:23.690
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a different kind of vessel.</v>

2694
01:56:23.700 --> 01:56:24.540
<v Speaker 4>Different kinds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2695
01:56:24.630 --> 01:56:27.480
<v Speaker 4>The stock of these and getting a bow</v>
<v Speaker 4>range and making the shot.</v>

2696
01:56:27.510 --> 01:56:28.081
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

2697
01:56:28.081 --> 01:56:30.300
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's almost as hard as it gets on the</v>

2698
01:56:30.301 --> 01:56:32.580
<v Speaker 4>animals that I've hunted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's some antelope in Africa that are</v>

2699
01:56:32.581 --> 01:56:35.370
<v Speaker 4>just as quick,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but um,</v>

2700
01:56:35.460 --> 01:56:37.680
<v Speaker 4>backpack hunting's probably the hardest</v>
<v Speaker 4>physically.</v>

2701
01:56:37.680 --> 01:56:38.340
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

2702
01:56:38.340 --> 01:56:39.360
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's,</v>

2703
01:56:39.570 --> 01:56:44.570
<v Speaker 4>that's a whole different challenge and a</v>
<v Speaker 4>whole different knowledge base that</v>

2704
01:56:45.061 --> 01:56:49.620
<v Speaker 4>you'd have to delve into,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but as far as stocking and getting those</v>

2705
01:56:49.621 --> 01:56:51.180
<v Speaker 4>killed with the bow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these access,</v>

2706
01:56:51.181 --> 01:56:52.200
<v Speaker 4>dear,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're right.</v>

2707
01:56:52.470 --> 01:56:57.470
<v Speaker 4>Also like I would imagine that backpack</v>
<v Speaker 4>hunting in the mountains is also more</v>

2708
01:56:58.081 --> 01:57:01.320
<v Speaker 4>mentally taxing because you can't just</v>
<v Speaker 4>go back to the cabin.</v>

2709
01:57:01.530 --> 01:57:05.310
<v Speaker 4>You can't just go back to the lodge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're out there in a tent and you're 20</v>

2710
01:57:05.311 --> 01:57:08.190
<v Speaker 4>miles in and if you break your ankle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to die.</v>

2711
01:57:08.250 --> 01:57:09.300
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

2712
01:57:09.450 --> 01:57:10.740
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to have to take that thing</v>

2713
01:57:10.741 --> 01:57:13.710
<v Speaker 4>up and crawl out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a little better now because people</v>

2714
01:57:13.711 --> 01:57:15.850
<v Speaker 4>have way more access than when I started</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I,</v>

2715
01:57:15.930 --> 01:57:18.240
<v Speaker 4>there was this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'd have to get to the top of the</v>

2716
01:57:18.241 --> 01:57:21.030
<v Speaker 4>mountain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even get barely cell phone service if</v>

2717
01:57:21.031 --> 01:57:23.270
<v Speaker 4>that was even possible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but now you know,</v>

2718
01:57:23.280 --> 01:57:24.450
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of light phones.</v>

2719
01:57:24.450 --> 01:57:25.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2720
01:57:25.110 --> 01:57:26.940
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people have access to which,</v>

2721
01:57:27.150 --> 01:57:29.280
<v Speaker 4>which is nice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but still it's,</v>

2722
01:57:29.640 --> 01:57:32.310
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's intimidating for a lot of people.</v>

2723
01:57:32.610 --> 01:57:34.470
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The barrier for entry is very high.</v>

2724
01:57:34.740 --> 01:57:36.600
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very hard to get started.</v>

2725
01:57:36.601 --> 01:57:40.290
<v Speaker 4>And I'm just really lucky that I got</v>
<v Speaker 4>started because of a podcast that I got</v>

2726
01:57:40.291 --> 01:57:44.460
<v Speaker 4>to meet Rinella and got into hunting and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then got to meet you and then got into</v>

2727
01:57:44.461 --> 01:57:46.410
<v Speaker 4>archery and bow hunting and all that</v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>

2728
01:57:46.411 --> 01:57:49.470
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's for someone on the outside</v>

2729
01:57:49.471 --> 01:57:52.740
<v Speaker 4>that's looking in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's extremely difficult now.</v>

2730
01:57:52.770 --> 01:57:55.950
<v Speaker 4>But here's what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You go to a archery pro shop.</v>

2731
01:57:56.160 --> 01:57:58.920
<v Speaker 4>Most people have those.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know there's one down here in San</v>

2732
01:57:58.920 --> 01:58:00.450
<v Speaker 4>Diego,</v>
<v Speaker 4>performance archery.</v>

2733
01:58:00.730 --> 01:58:03.780
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I met Scott Eastwood at one in Riverside</v>

2734
01:58:04.050 --> 01:58:07.200
<v Speaker 4>and I think it's called Riverside</v>
<v Speaker 4>archery back home.</v>

2735
01:58:07.201 --> 01:58:09.660
<v Speaker 4>It's a bottle rack,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's these pro shops if that's</v>

2736
01:58:09.661 --> 01:58:10.890
<v Speaker 4>what they do every day.</v>

2737
01:58:10.890 --> 01:58:13.920
<v Speaker 4>So the key with any hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>any archery hunting you're going to do</v>

2738
01:58:13.921 --> 01:58:16.530
<v Speaker 4>shooting that Bo and shooting it</v>
<v Speaker 4>consistently,</v>

2739
01:58:16.770 --> 01:58:19.350
<v Speaker 4>getting those reps in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's where,</v>

2740
01:58:19.640 --> 01:58:21.930
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't control the experience you</v>

2741
01:58:21.931 --> 01:58:22.770
<v Speaker 4>get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2742
01:58:23.190 --> 01:58:27.420
<v Speaker 4>that kind of comes slowly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But like what you've taken control of is</v>

2743
01:58:27.930 --> 01:58:31.260
<v Speaker 4>the repetition and the discipline was</v>
<v Speaker 4>shooting an Arrow and doing it</v>

2744
01:58:31.261 --> 01:58:34.200
<v Speaker 4>accurately.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So once you control that part of it,</v>

2745
01:58:34.500 --> 01:58:38.010
<v Speaker 4>the hunting experience is going to come.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The stock experience,</v>

2746
01:58:38.011 --> 01:58:39.450
<v Speaker 4>the learning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the animals that's going to come.</v>

2747
01:58:39.600 --> 01:58:41.980
<v Speaker 4>But at least when you get that</v>
<v Speaker 4>opportunity be able to make the shot.</v>

2748
01:58:42.220 --> 01:58:45.610
<v Speaker 4>So for what I fought for new people who</v>
<v Speaker 4>are interested,</v>

2749
01:58:45.730 --> 01:58:48.370
<v Speaker 4>get to an archer pro shop,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get set up with the good bow,</v>

2750
01:58:48.490 --> 01:58:50.890
<v Speaker 4>learn how to shoot correctly and do it a</v>
<v Speaker 4>lot,</v>

2751
01:58:51.130 --> 01:58:53.410
<v Speaker 4>and then you branch out and set up the</v>
<v Speaker 4>hunts.</v>

2752
01:58:53.650 --> 01:58:57.790
<v Speaker 4>It's just so difficult to execute a</v>
<v Speaker 4>shot.</v>

2753
01:58:57.790 --> 01:58:58.990
<v Speaker 4>An animal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2754
01:58:58.991 --> 01:59:03.160
<v Speaker 4>it was way different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People don't have any idea how much</v>

2755
01:59:03.161 --> 01:59:07.090
<v Speaker 4>anxiety and how much adrenaline is</v>
<v Speaker 4>pumping through your system when you're</v>

2756
01:59:07.091 --> 01:59:09.310
<v Speaker 4>drawn back on an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2757
01:59:09.660 --> 01:59:14.470
<v Speaker 4>I mean the consequences are so grave.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything is so high stakes.</v>

2758
01:59:15.220 --> 01:59:16.510
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2759
01:59:16.860 --> 01:59:18.730
<v Speaker 4>you only get this one shot like here it</v>
<v Speaker 4>is.</v>

2760
01:59:18.900 --> 01:59:21.490
<v Speaker 4>And especially say if you're on a back</v>
<v Speaker 4>country hunt,</v>

2761
01:59:21.910 --> 01:59:23.880
<v Speaker 4>you go 20 miles in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

2762
01:59:23.910 --> 01:59:26.650
<v Speaker 4>there's 190 inch mule deer just standing</v>
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>

2763
01:59:26.800 --> 01:59:30.340
<v Speaker 4>hey feeding and you get this one shot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is your one shot.</v>

2764
01:59:30.370 --> 01:59:32.790
<v Speaker 4>Even,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you haven't seen a deer in six days to</v>

2765
01:59:32.800 --> 01:59:37.670
<v Speaker 4>finally see a deer and you draw back and</v>
<v Speaker 4>your arms are shaking and you just try</v>

2766
01:59:37.671 --> 01:59:41.290
<v Speaker 4>and trying to go through your shot</v>
<v Speaker 4>process without flinching and fucking</v>

2767
01:59:41.291 --> 01:59:44.970
<v Speaker 4>panicking and just slamming that trigger</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it's fucking door in a monster or</v>

2768
01:59:44.971 --> 01:59:45.910
<v Speaker 4>something of his line of it.</v>

2769
01:59:46.060 --> 01:59:49.480
<v Speaker 4>People want a shortcut.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was the same way.</v>

2770
01:59:49.481 --> 01:59:51.220
<v Speaker 4>I'd been on hunts like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been on,</v>

2771
01:59:51.280 --> 01:59:54.340
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nate semans me on a hunt where I was in</v>

2772
01:59:54.341 --> 01:59:57.610
<v Speaker 4>the Eagle cap wilderness and I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to,</v>

2773
01:59:57.660 --> 01:59:59.620
<v Speaker 4>or I'm trying to think if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2774
01:59:59.621 --> 02:00:03.470
<v Speaker 4>we didn't see</v>
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>

2775
02:00:03.480 --> 02:00:05.380
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to say we didn't see an elk for</v>

2776
02:00:05.381 --> 02:00:10.381
<v Speaker 4>something like six days.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I killed a buck on day seven,</v>

2777
02:00:10.391 --> 02:00:12.820
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and a bowl on day eight.</v>

2778
02:00:13.210 --> 02:00:16.210
<v Speaker 4>But there was a long time in there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas like,</v>

2779
02:00:16.420 --> 02:00:18.230
<v Speaker 4>what are we doing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2780
02:00:18.280 --> 02:00:23.280
<v Speaker 4>So it's really easy when you finally do</v>
<v Speaker 4>get that opportunity to want to shortcut</v>

2781
02:00:23.590 --> 02:00:26.140
<v Speaker 4>from seeing it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to holding the antlers in your hands and</v>

2782
02:00:26.141 --> 02:00:28.780
<v Speaker 4>being successful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's where people rush it.</v>

2783
02:00:29.020 --> 02:00:30.740
<v Speaker 4>They get back and they just want to get</v>
<v Speaker 4>that air.</v>

2784
02:00:30.741 --> 02:00:34.090
<v Speaker 4>A lot of it's way anxiety cause as</v>
<v Speaker 4>sooner an arrow can be going towards</v>

2785
02:00:34.091 --> 02:00:37.600
<v Speaker 4>that animal that feel like the closer</v>
<v Speaker 4>they are to holding that animal to make</v>

2786
02:00:37.601 --> 02:00:38.434
<v Speaker 4>it a good shot.</v>

2787
02:00:38.470 --> 02:00:40.140
<v Speaker 4>But man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you still have to go.</v>

2788
02:00:40.310 --> 02:00:42.190
<v Speaker 4>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't skip a step.</v>

2789
02:00:42.790 --> 02:00:45.370
<v Speaker 4>Anxiety's a crazy thing man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2790
02:00:45.850 --> 02:00:49.370
<v Speaker 4>it's a crazy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like that adrenaline and that the</v>

2791
02:00:49.450 --> 02:00:53.200
<v Speaker 4>feeling of discomfort.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is like this like uncertainty</v>

2792
02:00:53.201 --> 02:00:54.260
<v Speaker 4>feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2793
02:00:54.700 --> 02:00:56.290
<v Speaker 4>It's just very hard for people to</v>
<v Speaker 4>handle.</v>

2794
02:00:56.291 --> 02:01:00.190
<v Speaker 4>But that's with the case of the anything</v>
<v Speaker 4>where you have to perform anything where</v>

2795
02:01:00.191 --> 02:01:02.440
<v Speaker 4>it's difficult to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where you're just like,</v>

2796
02:01:02.441 --> 02:01:03.400
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it happening?</v>

2797
02:01:03.430 --> 02:01:04.251
<v Speaker 4>It's happening right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2798
02:01:04.251 --> 02:01:07.030
<v Speaker 4>ah yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The brain is so,</v>

2799
02:01:07.120 --> 02:01:10.300
<v Speaker 4>it's wired with all these different</v>
<v Speaker 4>chemicals that are excreta.</v>

2800
02:01:11.110 --> 02:01:13.600
<v Speaker 4>When that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when that moment's happening,</v>

2801
02:01:13.601 --> 02:01:18.400
<v Speaker 4>when when there's a this final event,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is it.</v>

2802
02:01:18.580 --> 02:01:21.460
<v Speaker 4>Here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All my God ready action.</v>

2803
02:01:21.520 --> 02:01:26.520
<v Speaker 4>That's where I think all the reps you've</v>
<v Speaker 4>put in paid off cause on that first</v>

2804
02:01:26.681 --> 02:01:29.140
<v Speaker 4>buck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it was 15 minutes into the hut.</v>

2805
02:01:29.200 --> 02:01:32.980
<v Speaker 4>It was even Alec who's been doing that</v>
<v Speaker 4>for 30 years has never had a hunt that</v>

2806
02:01:32.981 --> 02:01:35.410
<v Speaker 4>played out that quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that perfectly.</v>

2807
02:01:35.860 --> 02:01:37.900
<v Speaker 4>But I think you told me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2808
02:01:38.230 --> 02:01:40.220
<v Speaker 4>I'm always,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm always trying to get into the,</v>

2809
02:01:40.280 --> 02:01:44.000
<v Speaker 4>to the heads of other hunters and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and just wanting to know what the</v>

2810
02:01:44.090 --> 02:01:46.640
<v Speaker 4>thought process is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I think you told me that when you're</v>

2811
02:01:46.641 --> 02:01:50.600
<v Speaker 4>in bow range of that buck right out of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the gate on the early in the hunt,</v>

2812
02:01:50.930 --> 02:01:54.650
<v Speaker 4>didn't you take a few deep breaths and</v>
<v Speaker 4>relaxed and you say that.</v>

2813
02:01:54.700 --> 02:01:55.670
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2814
02:01:55.910 --> 02:01:59.510
<v Speaker 4>And that's a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their tents,</v>

2815
02:01:59.570 --> 02:02:01.550
<v Speaker 4>their tents because there's so much</v>
<v Speaker 4>going on,</v>

2816
02:02:01.640 --> 02:02:05.030
<v Speaker 4>they never relax and that shot is just</v>
<v Speaker 4>not going to be accurate.</v>

2817
02:02:05.450 --> 02:02:08.600
<v Speaker 4>But when you can relax and then just</v>
<v Speaker 4>like in your backyard,</v>

2818
02:02:08.601 --> 02:02:12.170
<v Speaker 4>you come and you focus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're just as calm as you've done a</v>

2819
02:02:12.170 --> 02:02:14.210
<v Speaker 4>thousand times and you can pick that</v>
<v Speaker 4>spot,</v>

2820
02:02:14.240 --> 02:02:16.490
<v Speaker 4>level,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that bubble and slowly squeeze that</v>

2821
02:02:16.491 --> 02:02:18.350
<v Speaker 4>trigger.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's when it works.</v>

2822
02:02:18.740 --> 02:02:20.330
<v Speaker 4>That's super hard to do.</v>

2823
02:02:20.780 --> 02:02:24.860
<v Speaker 4>Well it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was happening so fast before we knew</v>

2824
02:02:24.861 --> 02:02:27.350
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We kicked her shoes off and we're</v>

2825
02:02:27.351 --> 02:02:28.490
<v Speaker 4>walking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2826
02:02:28.491 --> 02:02:30.190
<v Speaker 4>just with socks on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2827
02:02:30.260 --> 02:02:34.760
<v Speaker 4>Just creeping through the grass and we</v>
<v Speaker 4>got to 45 yards and he's like,</v>

2828
02:02:34.761 --> 02:02:35.780
<v Speaker 4>do you want to get closer?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

2829
02:02:35.781 --> 02:02:37.040
<v Speaker 4>this is perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stop right here.</v>

2830
02:02:37.230 --> 02:02:38.060
<v Speaker 4>Younger.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Got It.</v>

2831
02:02:38.060 --> 02:02:39.170
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I just went,</v>

2832
02:02:40.850 --> 02:02:42.490
<v Speaker 4>just took a couple of deep ones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2833
02:02:42.620 --> 02:02:45.140
<v Speaker 4>And it was feeding and then I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2834
02:02:45.530 --> 02:02:47.030
<v Speaker 4>I know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And just did it.</v>

2835
02:02:47.031 --> 02:02:48.500
<v Speaker 4>And when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they'll walk,</v>

2836
02:02:48.680 --> 02:02:51.050
<v Speaker 4>when I heard the impact of the arrows</v>
<v Speaker 4>was like,</v>

2837
02:02:51.051 --> 02:02:53.060
<v Speaker 4>holy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There it is.</v>

2838
02:02:53.120 --> 02:02:54.200
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2839
02:02:54.260 --> 02:02:56.690
<v Speaker 4>That was a perfect execution.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2840
02:02:56.691 --> 02:02:58.670
<v Speaker 4>It's a weird feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2841
02:02:58.671 --> 02:03:01.040
<v Speaker 4>When does like did that really happen?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did that really happen?</v>

2842
02:03:01.041 --> 02:03:03.680
<v Speaker 4>Then we're standing over the the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then I sent you a picture of it.</v>

2843
02:03:03.920 --> 02:03:04.753
<v Speaker 4>I said boom.</v>

2844
02:03:04.790 --> 02:03:06.650
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that was,</v>

2845
02:03:06.710 --> 02:03:08.240
<v Speaker 4>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>perfect execution,</v>

2846
02:03:08.241 --> 02:03:12.290
<v Speaker 4>not of killing the animal of the shot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it perfect execution of the shot?</v>

2847
02:03:12.291 --> 02:03:15.110
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying we were executing animals</v>
<v Speaker 4>that people don't understand.</v>

2848
02:03:15.111 --> 02:03:16.820
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not,</v>

2849
02:03:18.080 --> 02:03:23.080
<v Speaker 4>there's so much physical action involved</v>
<v Speaker 4>in pulling a bow back and being in</v>

2850
02:03:24.711 --> 02:03:28.700
<v Speaker 4>perfect position and making sure you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>not torquing the bow and leveling the</v>

2851
02:03:28.701 --> 02:03:32.600
<v Speaker 4>bubble on the site and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and pulling with the back muscles and</v>

2852
02:03:32.601 --> 02:03:36.830
<v Speaker 4>making sure everything's in line and</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no flinching or extra movement</v>

2853
02:03:36.831 --> 02:03:39.230
<v Speaker 4>and you're concentrating on the exact</v>
<v Speaker 4>spot.</v>

2854
02:03:39.231 --> 02:03:43.850
<v Speaker 4>You want that Arrow to hit as the things</v>
<v Speaker 4>releasing all under extreme anxiety and</v>

2855
02:03:43.851 --> 02:03:45.560
<v Speaker 4>pressure and this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it moving?</v>

2856
02:03:45.561 --> 02:03:47.450
<v Speaker 4>Is it going to keep walking?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's going to happen?</v>

2857
02:03:47.451 --> 02:03:50.960
<v Speaker 4>And there's so much involved,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the feeling when it's over the</v>

2858
02:03:50.961 --> 02:03:54.830
<v Speaker 4>relief and then knowing that I'm going</v>
<v Speaker 4>to have this organic meat,</v>

2859
02:03:55.050 --> 02:03:57.890
<v Speaker 4>it is the most delicious meat in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>world and I'm going to be cooking and I</v>

2860
02:03:57.891 --> 02:03:58.720
<v Speaker 4>can't wait to cook it.</v>

2861
02:03:58.720 --> 02:04:00.140
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I haven't cooked any of it,</v>

2862
02:04:00.141 --> 02:04:01.240
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2863
02:04:01.310 --> 02:04:02.870
<v Speaker 4>I can't wait.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to cook some tonight.</v>

2864
02:04:03.140 --> 02:04:04.490
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2865
02:04:04.610 --> 02:04:05.421
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a,</v>

2866
02:04:05.421 --> 02:04:09.350
<v Speaker 4>it's a powerful experience for almost</v>
<v Speaker 4>anybody and it's one that I know not</v>

2867
02:04:09.351 --> 02:04:11.620
<v Speaker 4>everybody can hunt and under ray who</v>
<v Speaker 4>listens to this is,</v>

2868
02:04:11.720 --> 02:04:16.010
<v Speaker 4>is probably ever going to hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But those that do will understand,</v>

2869
02:04:16.100 --> 02:04:17.360
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's not always going to be</v>

2870
02:04:17.361 --> 02:04:19.060
<v Speaker 4>comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not always killing an animal,</v>

2871
02:04:19.061 --> 02:04:22.550
<v Speaker 4>is not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people aren't going to have warm and</v>

2872
02:04:22.551 --> 02:04:24.830
<v Speaker 4>fuzzy feelings about seeing an animal</v>
<v Speaker 4>dead,</v>

2873
02:04:25.820 --> 02:04:27.980
<v Speaker 4>but they are going to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's something about taking</v>

2874
02:04:27.981 --> 02:04:31.070
<v Speaker 4>responsibility for the meat that you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>eating.</v>

2875
02:04:31.370 --> 02:04:34.880
<v Speaker 4>And that's going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if relief is the right</v>

2876
02:04:34.881 --> 02:04:36.350
<v Speaker 4>word,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>

2877
02:04:36.351 --> 02:04:39.660
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just that connection that I think</v>

2878
02:04:39.900 --> 02:04:41.490
<v Speaker 4>they're gonna it's gonna make more</v>
<v Speaker 4>sense.</v>

2879
02:04:41.880 --> 02:04:44.400
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one thing that confuses people with you</v>

2880
02:04:44.610 --> 02:04:48.930
<v Speaker 4>is when they find out that you run ultra</v>
<v Speaker 4>marathons and you're working out all the</v>

2881
02:04:48.931 --> 02:04:50.580
<v Speaker 4>time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like why is he doing all that stuff?</v>

2882
02:04:50.820 --> 02:04:51.121
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2883
02:04:51.121 --> 02:04:55.050
<v Speaker 4>I do that to be my very best when I'm in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the mountains,</v>

2884
02:04:55.051 --> 02:04:57.150
<v Speaker 4>when I'm hunting people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen people go,</v>

2885
02:04:57.151 --> 02:04:58.260
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2886
02:04:58.290 --> 02:04:59.070
<v Speaker 4>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wait a minute.</v>

2887
02:04:59.070 --> 02:05:02.100
<v Speaker 4>You work out every day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you run twice a day,</v>

2888
02:05:02.190 --> 02:05:06.060
<v Speaker 4>you run ultra marathons,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but to test yourself so that when you're</v>

2889
02:05:06.061 --> 02:05:08.340
<v Speaker 4>hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could be at your very best.</v>

2890
02:05:08.341 --> 02:05:09.870
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2891
02:05:09.900 --> 02:05:12.720
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think people understand how much</v>

2892
02:05:12.721 --> 02:05:14.730
<v Speaker 4>it means to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2893
02:05:14.910 --> 02:05:17.820
<v Speaker 4>I feel like I owe it to the animal to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>at my best.</v>

2894
02:05:18.510 --> 02:05:23.510
<v Speaker 4>I feel like if the animal suffers longer</v>
<v Speaker 4>than then I believe it should.</v>

2895
02:05:25.680 --> 02:05:28.320
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't like dealing with that.</v>

2896
02:05:28.321 --> 02:05:30.370
<v Speaker 4>I don't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I feel like I,</v>

2897
02:05:30.400 --> 02:05:34.440
<v Speaker 4>there's a weight of that on my shoulder,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shoulders where I need to be at my best</v>

2898
02:05:34.441 --> 02:05:36.960
<v Speaker 4>as a hunter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And to do that,</v>

2899
02:05:36.961 --> 02:05:40.080
<v Speaker 4>I put in work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I prepare every day and I just want to</v>

2900
02:05:40.081 --> 02:05:44.190
<v Speaker 4>know that I'm going to be merciful when</v>
<v Speaker 4>it comes time to kill the animal.</v>

2901
02:05:44.370 --> 02:05:48.060
<v Speaker 4>But you're also going to be in shape</v>
<v Speaker 4>enough to get to position to get to the</v>

2902
02:05:48.061 --> 02:05:50.460
<v Speaker 4>animal and have your heart rate dropped</v>
<v Speaker 4>down.</v>

2903
02:05:50.461 --> 02:05:52.170
<v Speaker 4>And also the state calm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2904
02:05:52.320 --> 02:05:54.540
<v Speaker 4>This is why you do so much cardio.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2905
02:05:54.660 --> 02:05:55.381
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

2906
02:05:55.381 --> 02:05:56.430
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on this hunt,</v>

2907
02:05:56.460 --> 02:06:00.150
<v Speaker 4>I've felt all that worked out exactly</v>
<v Speaker 4>how it was supposed to.</v>

2908
02:06:00.600 --> 02:06:01.840
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>quick,</v>

2909
02:06:01.890 --> 02:06:05.370
<v Speaker 4>very quick clean deaths and then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2910
02:06:05.371 --> 02:06:07.650
<v Speaker 4>like in the buck that I killed just a</v>
<v Speaker 4>couple of days ago,</v>

2911
02:06:07.651 --> 02:06:09.390
<v Speaker 4>that second buck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was able to,</v>

2912
02:06:09.630 --> 02:06:12.120
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's something about putting the a</v>

2913
02:06:12.121 --> 02:06:14.940
<v Speaker 4>dead animal on your shoulders and</v>
<v Speaker 4>packing it out that uh,</v>

2914
02:06:15.480 --> 02:06:17.070
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just part of the process.</v>

2915
02:06:17.071 --> 02:06:18.900
<v Speaker 4>It just feels right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2916
02:06:18.901 --> 02:06:22.350
<v Speaker 4>But for a lot of people that seem so</v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy,</v>

2917
02:06:22.351 --> 02:06:23.041
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wait a minute,</v>

2918
02:06:23.041 --> 02:06:27.540
<v Speaker 4>you run a marathon a day so that you</v>
<v Speaker 4>could be in shape to go hunting.</v>

2919
02:06:27.660 --> 02:06:29.190
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can't you just go hunting?</v>

2920
02:06:29.730 --> 02:06:31.080
<v Speaker 4>You can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people do.</v>

2921
02:06:31.490 --> 02:06:32.670
<v Speaker 4>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not here.</v>

2922
02:06:32.730 --> 02:06:36.180
<v Speaker 4>I'm not here to judge anybody or to tell</v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody that they need to do what I do</v>

2923
02:06:36.181 --> 02:06:39.270
<v Speaker 4>or they're doing it wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm saying that's what people that,</v>

2924
02:06:39.630 --> 02:06:41.820
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hunting is such a personal journey.</v>

2925
02:06:42.030 --> 02:06:45.270
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when people say maybe hunting is fun for</v>

2926
02:06:45.271 --> 02:06:49.050
<v Speaker 4>some people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe for some people it is fun to kill</v>

2927
02:06:49.051 --> 02:06:49.950
<v Speaker 4>an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2928
02:06:49.951 --> 02:06:51.900
<v Speaker 4>For me it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and people said,</v>

2929
02:06:52.080 --> 02:06:53.130
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you couldn't admit it.</v>

2930
02:06:53.131 --> 02:06:54.150
<v Speaker 4>It's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

2931
02:06:54.240 --> 02:06:55.270
<v Speaker 4>it's not fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2932
02:06:55.650 --> 02:06:58.710
<v Speaker 4>I know what it means to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What it means to me is I need to be at</v>

2933
02:06:58.711 --> 02:07:02.130
<v Speaker 4>my very best to be at my very best.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I need to run a marathon a day.</v>

2934
02:07:02.131 --> 02:07:04.560
<v Speaker 4>I need to work harder than I've ever</v>
<v Speaker 4>worked.</v>

2935
02:07:04.710 --> 02:07:07.560
<v Speaker 4>So I'm at the top of my game on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>hunt.</v>

2936
02:07:08.070 --> 02:07:12.660
<v Speaker 4>I don't care what you think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or I don't care about your mindset.</v>

2937
02:07:12.810 --> 02:07:14.310
<v Speaker 4>I'm not talking about you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm talking about me.</v>

2938
02:07:14.670 --> 02:07:16.260
<v Speaker 4>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people have a hard time with that.</v>

2939
02:07:16.560 --> 02:07:19.020
<v Speaker 4>Will they have a hard time believe in</v>
<v Speaker 4>first of all that you run a marathon a</v>

2940
02:07:19.021 --> 02:07:20.400
<v Speaker 4>day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even you saying that,</v>

2941
02:07:20.401 --> 02:07:21.840
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>imagine if I didn't know this guy.</v>

2953
02:07:42.670 --> 02:07:44.410
<v Speaker 3>to say why they don't do it is because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2954
02:07:44.411 --> 02:07:46.210
<v Speaker 3>I spend time with my family.</v>

02:08:42.100 --> 02:08:44.120
<v Speaker 3>So I go running.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2986
02:08:44.380 --> 02:08:46.660
<v Speaker 3>and how far do you run at lunch?</v>
<v Speaker 3>At lunch,</v>

2987
02:08:46.661 --> 02:08:48.310
<v Speaker 3>I'll try to get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I,</v>

2988
02:08:48.850 --> 02:08:51.550
<v Speaker 3>if I'm trying to get a marathon done a</v>
<v Speaker 3>day,</v>

2989
02:08:52.210 --> 02:08:53.110
<v Speaker 3>I don't go to the mountain.</v>

2990
02:08:53.110 --> 02:08:55.450
<v Speaker 3>I just go flat and I get at least 13</v>
<v Speaker 3>dental lunch.</v>

2991
02:08:55.990 --> 02:08:58.810
<v Speaker 3>So combined 19.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

2992
02:08:58.840 --> 02:09:02.620
<v Speaker 3>Before you even get home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then the last run of the day,</v>

2993
02:09:03.130 --> 02:09:05.980
<v Speaker 3>on my way home from work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll go to the mountain and I'll get</v>

2994
02:09:05.981 --> 02:09:10.750
<v Speaker 3>that last seven or eight done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's free runs a day.</v>

2995
02:09:10.870 --> 02:09:14.290
<v Speaker 3>And that'll be a marathon a day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a lot of fucking running now.</v>

2996
02:09:15.070 --> 02:09:18.010
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not for you because it was fine.</v>

2997
02:09:18.100 --> 02:09:21.010
<v Speaker 3>I don't feel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel 100% healthy.</v>

2998
02:09:21.490 --> 02:09:24.160
<v Speaker 3>I don't feel banged up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't feel anything.</v>

2999
02:09:24.170 --> 02:09:26.200
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a question I always get.</v>

3000
02:09:26.201 --> 02:09:27.034
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you,</v>

3001
02:09:27.130 --> 02:09:27.963
<v Speaker 3>people say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3002
02:09:28.240 --> 02:09:32.020
<v Speaker 3>how do you recover and how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or do you have so much muscle at?</v>

3003
02:09:32.021 --> 02:09:33.760
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I weigh 170 pounds.</v>

3004
02:09:33.761 --> 02:09:36.040
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have like muscle everywhere.</v>

3005
02:09:36.041 --> 02:09:39.850
<v Speaker 3>So I'm not big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I also eat meat all the time.</v>

3006
02:09:39.850 --> 02:09:40.810
<v Speaker 3>Every day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3007
02:09:40.811 --> 02:09:44.200
<v Speaker 3>you talked about the lions and wherever</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the river and they were eating just</v>

3008
02:09:44.201 --> 02:09:46.810
<v Speaker 3>buffalo and they were jacked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to have protein.</v>

3009
02:09:47.050 --> 02:09:51.340
<v Speaker 3>So if you can run a marathon a day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're eating salad,</v>

3010
02:09:51.341 --> 02:09:53.490
<v Speaker 3>you're going to wait 140 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

3011
02:09:53.830 --> 02:09:57.520
<v Speaker 3>If you run a marathon a day and you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>eating steak three times a day,</v>

3012
02:09:57.521 --> 02:09:59.620
<v Speaker 3>you're going to retain some muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's what I do.</v>

3013
02:09:59.800 --> 02:10:03.970
<v Speaker 3>I know what my body needs for calories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I know when I'm at my best,</v>

3014
02:10:03.971 --> 02:10:07.060
<v Speaker 3>it's when I have excess calories to</v>
<v Speaker 3>burn.</v>

3015
02:10:07.180 --> 02:10:09.280
<v Speaker 3>So that's what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I make sure I'm eating nonstop.</v>

3016
02:10:09.520 --> 02:10:11.500
<v Speaker 3>But you're also lifting weights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>

3017
02:10:11.530 --> 02:10:14.440
<v Speaker 3>How do you have the time to do all this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like listening to the schedule.</v>

3018
02:10:14.441 --> 02:10:15.580
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is ridiculous.</v>

3019
02:10:15.820 --> 02:10:17.140
<v Speaker 3>And then you shoot your bow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3020
02:10:17.230 --> 02:10:18.740
<v Speaker 3>And then you hang out with your family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3021
02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:20.470
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so campaigns,</v>

3022
02:10:20.670 --> 02:10:24.780
<v Speaker 3>the family,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the family time is about from a c I'll</v>

3023
02:10:24.790 --> 02:10:29.790
<v Speaker 3>get home at about six 30 till about and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then everybody will be going to bed at</v>

3024
02:10:31.601 --> 02:10:33.740
<v Speaker 3>10 so that's Fox time.</v>

3025
02:10:35.230 --> 02:10:37.000
<v Speaker 1>You know there's duck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3026
02:10:37.001 --> 02:10:38.890
<v Speaker 1>you fucking watches Fox News.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3027
02:10:38.891 --> 02:10:41.150
<v Speaker 1>in the evenings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really what you watch.</v>

3028
02:10:41.590 --> 02:10:43.360
<v Speaker 1>We watched the coins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Goddamn,</v>

3029
02:10:43.361 --> 02:10:45.350
<v Speaker 1>these liberals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we like watch the voice.</v>

3030
02:10:45.580 --> 02:10:47.620
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or American Luke's on the American art</v>

3031
02:10:47.680 --> 02:10:49.660
<v Speaker 3>or on American idol.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Luke Bryan's on there.</v>

3032
02:10:49.661 --> 02:10:51.640
<v Speaker 3>So we'll actually have a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes my daughter.</v>

3033
02:10:51.850 --> 02:10:55.510
<v Speaker 3>So that's what me and my daughter do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She loves the voice and uh,</v>

3034
02:10:56.350 --> 02:10:59.230
<v Speaker 3>and so it's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fine to get into that.</v>

3035
02:10:59.231 --> 02:11:01.570
<v Speaker 3>So that's what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I can,</v>

3036
02:11:02.020 --> 02:11:04.960
<v Speaker 3>if I'm just doing the close reps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like during the workweek,</v>

3037
02:11:05.470 --> 02:11:07.450
<v Speaker 3>it's generally just out of my house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just you know,</v>

3038
02:11:07.451 --> 02:11:10.630
<v Speaker 3>20 yards shooting my bow and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's just,</v>

3039
02:11:11.080 --> 02:11:15.160
<v Speaker 3>and then when I'll lift on Monday,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wednesday,</v>

3040
02:11:15.160 --> 02:11:20.160
<v Speaker 3>Friday I lift right after work and I'll</v>
<v Speaker 3>go outlaw strength and you know,</v>

3041
02:11:20.710 --> 02:11:23.140
<v Speaker 3>sometimes nick the trainer Dude hammered</v>
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>

3042
02:11:23.141 --> 02:11:27.190
<v Speaker 3>I'll take it home at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So on those days I'm not going to get a</v>

3043
02:11:27.191 --> 02:11:31.180
<v Speaker 3>marathon done a day on those three days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you feel like shit on those days</v>

3044
02:11:31.181 --> 02:11:32.440
<v Speaker 3>because you didn't get your marathon</v>
<v Speaker 3>then?</v>

3045
02:11:32.980 --> 02:11:35.090
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because lifting his heart they lifted in</v>

3046
02:11:35.100 --> 02:11:35.980
<v Speaker 3>his hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I,</v>

3047
02:11:36.040 --> 02:11:38.290
<v Speaker 3>I in the back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll be honest,</v>

3048
02:11:38.291 --> 02:11:40.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm not normal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>

3049
02:11:41.230 --> 02:11:46.230
<v Speaker 3>But in the back of my mind I'm thinking</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kind of suck a little bit cause I</v>

3050
02:11:46.601 --> 02:11:47.620
<v Speaker 3>didn't get a marathon done.</v>

3051
02:11:49.700 --> 02:11:51.150
<v Speaker 1>That is so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3052
02:11:51.350 --> 02:11:54.670
<v Speaker 1>That's my thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when you run an ultra and to save,</v>

3053
02:11:54.710 --> 02:11:58.940
<v Speaker 1>you run a hundred miles or more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When w w what kind of demons are going</v>

3054
02:11:58.941 --> 02:12:01.040
<v Speaker 1>through your head when you're out there</v>
<v Speaker 1>running?</v>

3055
02:12:01.290 --> 02:12:02.190
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

3056
02:12:02.191 --> 02:12:03.720
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what it is.</v>

3057
02:12:03.750 --> 02:12:04.500
<v Speaker 3>It's a</v>

3058
02:12:04.500 --> 02:12:08.310
<v Speaker 1>like the Moab to 40.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You rent 238 miles in three days.</v>

3059
02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:12.450
<v Speaker 1>What were you thinking while you were at</v>
<v Speaker 1>day two and a half?</v>

3060
02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:16.350
<v Speaker 3>Thinking is I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm honoring myself by getting the</v>

3061
02:12:16.351 --> 02:12:18.540
<v Speaker 3>absolute most out of my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I've,</v>

3062
02:12:18.810 --> 02:12:23.070
<v Speaker 3>I've reached my limit I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think if you're not getting the most</v>

3063
02:12:23.071 --> 02:12:24.450
<v Speaker 3>out of your body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not,</v>

3064
02:12:24.900 --> 02:12:26.940
<v Speaker 3>you're not taking advantage of your</v>
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>

3065
02:12:27.240 --> 02:12:30.480
<v Speaker 3>that you're not honoring your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So to me,</v>

3066
02:12:31.590 --> 02:12:36.450
<v Speaker 3>I need to find what my limit is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't halfway it.</v>

3067
02:12:36.480 --> 02:12:38.640
<v Speaker 3>I can't halfway because I feel like then</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>

3068
02:12:39.540 --> 02:12:40.373
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not,</v>

3069
02:12:40.950 --> 02:12:43.080
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't live with myself if I,</v>

3070
02:12:43.081 --> 02:12:44.690
<v Speaker 3>if I don't feel like I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm giving,</v>

3071
02:12:44.720 --> 02:12:46.710
<v Speaker 3>I have given everything that I have.</v>

3072
02:12:47.030 --> 02:12:50.900
<v Speaker 1>The weird thing about running is like as</v>
<v Speaker 1>you run more,</v>

3073
02:12:50.901 --> 02:12:55.190
<v Speaker 1>your capacity to run more increases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you realize like,</v>

3074
02:12:55.220 --> 02:12:59.390
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the body has more capability than</v>

3075
02:12:59.391 --> 02:13:03.950
<v Speaker 1>you think because you just have to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>accustomed to this amount of work and</v>

3076
02:13:03.951 --> 02:13:07.370
<v Speaker 1>then you can just do it all the time and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it gets used to it and then it</v>

3077
02:13:07.371 --> 02:13:10.940
<v Speaker 1>grows and expands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then your threshold and what your</v>

3078
02:13:10.941 --> 02:13:13.100
<v Speaker 1>expectations are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They increased too.</v>

3079
02:13:13.460 --> 02:13:17.240
<v Speaker 1>So in the beginning you were saying that</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you first started running,</v>

3080
02:13:17.241 --> 02:13:19.880
<v Speaker 1>like running a five k is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>holy shit,</v>

3081
02:13:19.881 --> 02:13:21.800
<v Speaker 1>this is hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or a 10 K is brutal.</v>

3082
02:13:21.950 --> 02:13:23.180
<v Speaker 1>You would never think like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

3083
02:13:23.181 --> 02:13:26.600
<v Speaker 1>can I do a marathon now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're fucking doing a marathon every</v>

3084
02:13:26.601 --> 02:13:27.560
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3085
02:13:27.860 --> 02:13:29.720
<v Speaker 1>And this is the same person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like,</v>

3086
02:13:29.721 --> 02:13:30.361
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are.</v>

3087
02:13:30.361 --> 02:13:32.250
<v Speaker 1>I've always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first time I started running,</v>

3088
02:13:32.251 --> 02:13:34.290
<v Speaker 1>I ran a fucking ultra marathon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3089
02:13:34.350 --> 02:13:34.690
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

3090
02:13:34.690 --> 02:13:35.291
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3091
02:13:35.291 --> 02:13:35.591
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

3092
02:13:35.591 --> 02:13:36.341
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3093
02:13:36.341 --> 02:13:38.740
<v Speaker 3>that's everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's everybody and everything.</v>

3094
02:13:39.040 --> 02:13:42.580
<v Speaker 3>You work up to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that it's no different from me.</v>

3095
02:13:42.581 --> 02:13:47.581
<v Speaker 3>I just feel like I'm finally getting to</v>
<v Speaker 3>my potential and I wasted a lot of years</v>

3096
02:13:48.970 --> 02:13:52.240
<v Speaker 3>not living up to my potential.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>

3097
02:13:52.810 --> 02:13:54.870
<v Speaker 3>when I do the running videos and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>smiling,</v>

3098
02:13:54.880 --> 02:13:57.550
<v Speaker 3>I'm in a good mood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's genuine cause I'm like,</v>

3099
02:13:57.551 --> 02:14:00.160
<v Speaker 3>this is my potential.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3100
02:14:00.580 --> 02:14:03.880
<v Speaker 3>I can't be happy sitting at home</v>
<v Speaker 3>watching t I'm going to do it because I</v>

3101
02:14:03.881 --> 02:14:06.250
<v Speaker 3>love my family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to hang out and do that,</v>

3102
02:14:06.490 --> 02:14:09.670
<v Speaker 3>but I can't be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't feel like that's my potential.</v>

3103
02:14:10.730 --> 02:14:14.390
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the thing that I think is very</v>

3104
02:14:14.391 --> 02:14:17.420
<v Speaker 1>important for people like you and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think a lot of people,</v>

3105
02:14:17.720 --> 02:14:21.470
<v Speaker 1>it's that in achieving goals and in</v>
<v Speaker 1>pushing hard,</v>

3106
02:14:21.770 --> 02:14:26.770
<v Speaker 1>there's a release of anxiety that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think overwhelmed a lot of people for</v>

3107
02:14:28.581 --> 02:14:30.950
<v Speaker 1>most of their life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of,</v>

3108
02:14:31.280 --> 02:14:35.570
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot of people that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>overwhelmed by anxiety and most of those</v>

3109
02:14:35.571 --> 02:14:38.690
<v Speaker 1>people that I know that are overwhelmed</v>
<v Speaker 1>by anxiety don't push themselves.</v>

3110
02:14:39.050 --> 02:14:43.730
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a connection there and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think that physically pushing yourself</v>

3111
02:14:43.731 --> 02:14:48.290
<v Speaker 1>to your limit all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's lifting weights or Jujitsu</v>

3112
02:14:48.291 --> 02:14:50.960
<v Speaker 1>or running or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do that strenuous,</v>

3113
02:14:51.440 --> 02:14:55.790
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a requirement for the human</v>
<v Speaker 1>body that we think of as an option.</v>

3114
02:14:56.150 --> 02:14:58.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's an option.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

3115
02:14:58.250 --> 02:15:00.440
<v Speaker 1>Especially not for mental health.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

3116
02:15:00.441 --> 02:15:02.240
<v Speaker 1>I think it's really critical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

3117
02:15:02.510 --> 02:15:05.360
<v Speaker 1>I think really hard exercises.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

3118
02:15:05.361 --> 02:15:08.720
<v Speaker 1>and I don't care what you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether you're swimming or whatever you</v>

3119
02:15:08.721 --> 02:15:10.880
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you enjoy mountain biking.</v>

3120
02:15:10.970 --> 02:15:15.830
<v Speaker 1>But I think really hard exercise is one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the most important requirements for</v>

3121
02:15:15.831 --> 02:15:17.360
<v Speaker 1>like a happy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy life.</v>

3122
02:15:17.720 --> 02:15:18.553
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>

3123
02:15:18.880 --> 02:15:20.010
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3124
02:15:21.670 --> 02:15:25.000
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could say that maybe I tried to</v>

3125
02:15:25.001 --> 02:15:29.680
<v Speaker 3>justify what I do to try to put logic to</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

3126
02:15:29.890 --> 02:15:32.680
<v Speaker 3>And maybe even what you're saying is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

3127
02:15:33.730 --> 02:15:36.340
<v Speaker 3>is a little bit of justification.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

3128
02:15:36.370 --> 02:15:40.390
<v Speaker 3>So I dunno if what I do is right or what</v>
<v Speaker 3>we should be doing.</v>

3129
02:15:40.420 --> 02:15:43.150
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just know how I feel when I do it,</v>

3130
02:15:43.600 --> 02:15:46.990
<v Speaker 3>but that doesn't mean I don't have</v>
<v Speaker 3>regret sometimes.</v>

3131
02:15:47.180 --> 02:15:50.080
<v Speaker 3>Like even with my kids now that they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>older and,</v>

3132
02:15:50.081 --> 02:15:51.340
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3133
02:15:51.520 --> 02:15:54.730
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really struggled wondering if the</v>

3134
02:15:54.731 --> 02:15:59.731
<v Speaker 3>message I had been sending to my family</v>
<v Speaker 3>about average is a failure.</v>

3135
02:16:01.030 --> 02:16:06.030
<v Speaker 3>If you're not giving your best,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not honoring your life basically.</v>

3136
02:16:06.190 --> 02:16:10.270
<v Speaker 3>And then I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe that's okay for some people.</v>

3137
02:16:10.300 --> 02:16:13.930
<v Speaker 3>Maybe not everybody needs to run a</v>
<v Speaker 3>marathon a day and they're fine and</v>

3138
02:16:13.931 --> 02:16:14.764
<v Speaker 3>they're happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

3139
02:16:15.310 --> 02:16:17.500
<v Speaker 3>who am I to say what makes somebody else</v>
<v Speaker 3>happy?</v>

3140
02:16:17.500 --> 02:16:20.920
<v Speaker 3>Just like I get mad when somebody tells</v>
<v Speaker 3>me how I should feel.</v>

3141
02:16:21.250 --> 02:16:23.560
<v Speaker 3>I can't say why they need.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so then I was like,</v>

3142
02:16:23.680 --> 02:16:28.680
<v Speaker 3>here's my kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My boys who are great young men strong,</v>

3143
02:16:29.680 --> 02:16:31.870
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have all the potential in the world.</v>

3144
02:16:32.200 --> 02:16:34.840
<v Speaker 3>Have I somehow have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

3145
02:16:35.440 --> 02:16:38.140
<v Speaker 3>being just a regular guy who has a job</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it comes home,</v>

3146
02:16:38.170 --> 02:16:39.940
<v Speaker 3>there's something wrong with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

3147
02:16:40.030 --> 02:16:42.130
<v Speaker 3>God did I screw up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's just like,</v>

3148
02:16:42.131 --> 02:16:45.340
<v Speaker 3>that's really been bothered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause my son quit a good job as a</v>

3149
02:16:45.341 --> 02:16:49.240
<v Speaker 3>deputy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my oldest and he joined the army because</v>

3150
02:16:49.300 --> 02:16:53.620
<v Speaker 3>he says he has more to offer this world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's hard.</v>

3151
02:16:54.620 --> 02:16:58.910
<v Speaker 1>Is it hard because well it's hard first</v>
<v Speaker 1>of all because your son is joining the</v>

3152
02:16:58.911 --> 02:17:00.740
<v Speaker 1>military and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

3153
02:17:00.770 --> 02:17:03.440
<v Speaker 1>my son could go to combat and I could</v>
<v Speaker 1>lose him.</v>

3154
02:17:03.500 --> 02:17:07.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But is it also hard because you feel</v>

3155
02:17:07.011 --> 02:17:12.011
<v Speaker 1>like your high expectations for yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>might have set a bar for him then maybe</v>

3156
02:17:14.961 --> 02:17:18.500
<v Speaker 1>doesn't line up with his initial</v>
<v Speaker 1>expectations?</v>

3157
02:17:18.501 --> 02:17:22.400
<v Speaker 1>You've made him think that whatever</v>
<v Speaker 1>might have made him happy before is not</v>

3158
02:17:22.401 --> 02:17:22.780
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

3159
02:17:22.780 --> 02:17:23.830
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that I,</v>

3160
02:17:23.870 --> 02:17:25.000
<v Speaker 3>that's what I thought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

3161
02:17:25.090 --> 02:17:25.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3162
02:17:27.860 --> 02:17:29.020
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3163
02:17:29.110 --> 02:17:31.660
<v Speaker 3>it was hard to deal with when he was</v>
<v Speaker 3>leaving.</v>

3164
02:17:31.661 --> 02:17:33.340
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

3165
02:17:33.640 --> 02:17:35.080
<v Speaker 3>what did I do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3166
02:17:35.140 --> 02:17:35.973
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3167
02:17:36.880 --> 02:17:37.900
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3168
02:17:37.901 --> 02:17:39.400
<v Speaker 3>I told him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3169
02:17:39.450 --> 02:17:42.130
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry if I ever made you feel that</v>

3170
02:17:42.430 --> 02:17:46.300
<v Speaker 3>that being a regular average person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was something wrong with that.</v>

3171
02:17:47.110 --> 02:17:49.360
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3172
02:17:49.820 --> 02:17:53.080
<v Speaker 3>the example that I've set growing up was</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

3173
02:17:53.081 --> 02:17:57.010
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to work hard and achieve big goals and,</v>

3174
02:17:57.280 --> 02:17:59.770
<v Speaker 3>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's what he wants to do.</v>

3175
02:18:00.280 --> 02:18:02.230
<v Speaker 3>And so he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>

3176
02:18:02.260 --> 02:18:03.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said that was for him.</v>

3177
02:18:04.300 --> 02:18:06.280
<v Speaker 3>And then my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my younger son,</v>

3178
02:18:06.970 --> 02:18:09.640
<v Speaker 3>who's in his third year of college now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

3179
02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:11.740
<v Speaker 3>I had the same talk with him and I just</v>
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

3180
02:18:11.741 --> 02:18:12.574
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3181
02:18:12.790 --> 02:18:16.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry if if I've done something to</v>
<v Speaker 3>make it feel like,</v>

3182
02:18:16.930 --> 02:18:18.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being,</v>

3183
02:18:18.460 --> 02:18:22.150
<v Speaker 3>being average was a failure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said that,</v>

3184
02:18:22.151 --> 02:18:24.040
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wants to graduate and he wants to</v>

3185
02:18:24.041 --> 02:18:28.150
<v Speaker 3>join the service and maybe try to go to</v>
<v Speaker 3>special forces too for the same reason.</v>

3186
02:18:28.151 --> 02:18:30.340
<v Speaker 3>And so I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dunno.</v>

3187
02:18:30.341 --> 02:18:34.090
<v Speaker 3>They don't act,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they act completely fine with it and</v>

3188
02:18:34.091 --> 02:18:34.924
<v Speaker 3>they'd love,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3189
02:18:34.960 --> 02:18:39.340
<v Speaker 3>they love working hard and have big</v>
<v Speaker 3>goals to achieve and um,</v>

3190
02:18:40.150 --> 02:18:44.260
<v Speaker 3>that part feels good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But sometimes I wonder if,</v>

3191
02:18:44.950 --> 02:18:46.090
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>

3192
02:18:46.091 --> 02:18:47.650
<v Speaker 3>I just second guess myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess.</v>

3193
02:18:49.350 --> 02:18:50.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard,</v>

3194
02:18:50.291 --> 02:18:51.124
<v Speaker 3>high expertise</v>

3195
02:18:51.380 --> 02:18:53.940
<v Speaker 1>and you put on kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult.</v>

3196
02:18:53.941 --> 02:18:56.160
<v Speaker 1>Like you want to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want them to be happy.</v>

3197
02:18:56.550 --> 02:19:00.070
<v Speaker 1>I just want them to live their lives on</v>
<v Speaker 1>their path and everyone,</v>

3198
02:19:00.450 --> 02:19:03.520
<v Speaker 1>like every kid has their own personality</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

3199
02:19:03.540 --> 02:19:06.570
<v Speaker 1>your three kids are all uniquely</v>
<v Speaker 1>different in their own way.</v>

3200
02:19:06.571 --> 02:19:09.180
<v Speaker 1>And who's to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's to say?</v>

3201
02:19:09.280 --> 02:19:12.510
<v Speaker 1>I think all you can do is live by</v>
<v Speaker 1>example and,</v>

3202
02:19:12.780 --> 02:19:16.620
<v Speaker 1>and support them and let them make the</v>
<v Speaker 1>choices that they decided to make.</v>

3203
02:19:16.950 --> 02:19:19.830
<v Speaker 1>The problem is the choices that they've</v>
<v Speaker 1>made are,</v>

3204
02:19:19.860 --> 02:19:21.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very stressful and very dangerous.</v>

3205
02:19:21.961 --> 02:19:23.710
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it might turn out to,</v>

3206
02:19:23.711 --> 02:19:28.010
<v Speaker 1>they might turn out like Tim Kennedy or</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone like Andy Stumpf be an awesome</v>

3207
02:19:28.010 --> 02:19:32.120
<v Speaker 4>human being,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's for you as a parent,</v>

3208
02:19:32.180 --> 02:19:37.070
<v Speaker 4>this is this incredibly stressful</v>
<v Speaker 4>pressure filled situation where you have</v>

3209
02:19:37.071 --> 02:19:40.670
<v Speaker 4>to reevaluate how you raised them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what I always,</v>

3210
02:19:41.120 --> 02:19:44.030
<v Speaker 4>my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what I told them growing up always was,</v>

3211
02:19:44.031 --> 02:19:47.240
<v Speaker 4>I don't care if you're the best at</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever you're doing,</v>

3212
02:19:47.270 --> 02:19:50.750
<v Speaker 4>but cause,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause not everybody can be the best.</v>

3213
02:19:50.751 --> 02:19:53.480
<v Speaker 4>But I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just give your best just be or best.</v>

3214
02:19:53.750 --> 02:19:56.030
<v Speaker 4>And so that's where I see if they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>coasting or whatever.</v>

3215
02:19:56.031 --> 02:19:57.920
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he got some more,</v>

3216
02:19:58.010 --> 02:20:00.850
<v Speaker 4>you got some more in you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's all I ever wanted.</v>

3217
02:20:00.940 --> 02:20:03.140
<v Speaker 4>But the things about people that coast</v>
<v Speaker 4>about stuff,</v>

3218
02:20:03.141 --> 02:20:08.030
<v Speaker 4>if they have like a thought of doing</v>
<v Speaker 4>better and they just don't put in the</v>

3219
02:20:08.031 --> 02:20:09.350
<v Speaker 4>effort,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they feel like shit.</v>

3220
02:20:09.380 --> 02:20:10.190
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3221
02:20:10.190 --> 02:20:11.900
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they feel like shit for you telling them</v>

3222
02:20:11.901 --> 02:20:13.700
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they feel like shit for shit,</v>

3223
02:20:13.820 --> 02:20:15.300
<v Speaker 4>for not doing well to yeah.</v>

3224
02:20:15.440 --> 02:20:17.450
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Especially if they have ambition.</v>

3225
02:20:17.451 --> 02:20:21.560
<v Speaker 4>If he unrealized potential as a fairy</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking horrible feeling,</v>

3226
02:20:21.730 --> 02:20:24.500
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unrealized potential and unrealized</v>

3227
02:20:24.501 --> 02:20:27.410
<v Speaker 4>expectations are just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like this feeling that you haven't</v>

3228
02:20:27.411 --> 02:20:29.000
<v Speaker 4>done enough,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll keep you up at night.</v>

3229
02:20:29.450 --> 02:20:31.280
<v Speaker 4>It will fuck with your head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's,</v>

3230
02:20:31.550 --> 02:20:35.600
<v Speaker 4>I just know how I felt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not giving all I got and I,</v>

3231
02:20:35.680 --> 02:20:39.050
<v Speaker 4>I don't want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't want my kids to feel like that,</v>

3232
02:20:39.051 --> 02:20:42.230
<v Speaker 4>so I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>make sure you're giving your best,</v>

3233
02:20:42.530 --> 02:20:44.390
<v Speaker 4>be your best.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>

3234
02:20:44.600 --> 02:20:46.610
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3235
02:20:47.060 --> 02:20:48.230
<v Speaker 4>but then I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then I was like,</v>

3236
02:20:48.590 --> 02:20:49.820
<v Speaker 4>what am I done?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3237
02:20:49.910 --> 02:20:52.190
<v Speaker 4>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3238
02:20:52.220 --> 02:20:54.650
<v Speaker 4>I can only speak for myself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3239
02:20:54.770 --> 02:20:55.520
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I,</v>

3240
02:20:55.520 --> 02:20:58.310
<v Speaker 4>when it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when tanner was born,</v>

3241
02:20:58.311 --> 02:21:00.350
<v Speaker 4>I was young.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3242
02:21:01.820 --> 02:21:03.350
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3243
02:21:03.351 --> 02:21:04.640
<v Speaker 4>being a parent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

3244
02:21:04.970 --> 02:21:09.260
<v Speaker 4>I feel like I'm better now than I was</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I was 24 years old.</v>

3245
02:21:09.920 --> 02:21:11.900
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3246
02:21:12.170 --> 02:21:14.540
<v Speaker 4>hopefully I'm pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe more,</v>

3247
02:21:15.250 --> 02:21:18.080
<v Speaker 4>I'm different with my daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's also a girl.</v>

3248
02:21:18.081 --> 02:21:19.190
<v Speaker 4>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is just,</v>

3249
02:21:19.191 --> 02:21:20.840
<v Speaker 4>that's different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But man,</v>

3250
02:21:20.841 --> 02:21:23.870
<v Speaker 4>it's like there's no blueprint on how to</v>
<v Speaker 4>be the perfect parent,</v>

3251
02:21:23.900 --> 02:21:26.600
<v Speaker 4>and now I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hope I did okay.</v>

3252
02:21:27.500 --> 02:21:29.570
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no blueprint.</v>

3253
02:21:29.600 --> 02:21:30.740
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's the blueprint?</v>

3254
02:21:30.741 --> 02:21:32.210
<v Speaker 4>And be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>be honest.</v>

3255
02:21:32.211 --> 02:21:36.800
<v Speaker 4>Give them the best version of your</v>
<v Speaker 4>thoughts on life that you can give them,</v>

3256
02:21:36.950 --> 02:21:38.990
<v Speaker 4>spend time with them when you can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3257
02:21:39.530 --> 02:21:41.150
<v Speaker 4>Then what is the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is the blueprint?</v>

3258
02:21:41.210 --> 02:21:44.300
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just try to help them figure out their</v>

3259
02:21:44.301 --> 02:21:46.370
<v Speaker 4>path in life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's also hard too,</v>

3260
02:21:46.371 --> 02:21:47.900
<v Speaker 4>because you've got a full time job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3261
02:21:47.901 --> 02:21:51.800
<v Speaker 4>how much time do you dedicate to them?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3262
02:21:51.801 --> 02:21:53.750
<v Speaker 4>how much time can you have?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3263
02:21:53.751 --> 02:21:56.860
<v Speaker 4>I mean it'd be be great if I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3264
02:21:56.861 --> 02:21:59.120
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to work anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just going to hang out with the kids</v>

3265
02:21:59.121 --> 02:22:00.260
<v Speaker 4>all day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3266
02:22:00.380 --> 02:22:01.730
<v Speaker 4>it's not realistic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3267
02:22:01.740 --> 02:22:06.410
<v Speaker 4>And you can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then also to be the example I felt</v>

3268
02:22:06.411 --> 02:22:11.411
<v Speaker 4>like I would need to set for the kids so</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'd believe they can achieve whatever</v>

3269
02:22:12.291 --> 02:22:14.570
<v Speaker 4>they wanted to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had to put in work myself.</v>

3270
02:22:14.960 --> 02:22:19.820
<v Speaker 4>I can't say you can be amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>While I'm half asking stuff.</v>

3271
02:22:20.180 --> 02:22:23.870
<v Speaker 4>When you say that you didn't reach your</v>
<v Speaker 4>full potential until like later in life,</v>

3272
02:22:23.871 --> 02:22:25.980
<v Speaker 4>like when do you feel like that was?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I</v>

3273
02:22:25.980 --> 02:22:26.910
<v Speaker 1>haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3274
02:22:26.911 --> 02:22:30.900
<v Speaker 1>but I mean like you realize that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>like really pushing to reach your full</v>

3275
02:22:30.901 --> 02:22:31.860
<v Speaker 1>potential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

3276
02:22:32.850 --> 02:22:35.460
<v Speaker 1>I still don't think I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I buy you're pushing towards it.</v>

3277
02:22:35.570 --> 02:22:36.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

3278
02:22:36.070 --> 02:22:37.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing more.</v>

3279
02:22:37.350 --> 02:22:38.730
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when did that change?</v>

3280
02:22:41.400 --> 02:22:44.790
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

3281
02:22:45.990 --> 02:22:47.610
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe,</v>

3282
02:22:48.120 --> 02:22:52.380
<v Speaker 3>maybe when I did my first hundred,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's 2009 I felt what,</v>

3283
02:22:53.310 --> 02:22:55.740
<v Speaker 3>what sacrifice real sacrifice was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

3284
02:22:57.360 --> 02:22:58.470
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3285
02:22:58.471 --> 02:23:02.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hard hunts when Roy and I would do super</v>

3286
02:23:02.161 --> 02:23:05.460
<v Speaker 3>hard hunts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd felt like I was given all I got</v>

3287
02:23:05.580 --> 02:23:08.130
<v Speaker 3>backpack haunts into the back country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3288
02:23:08.190 --> 02:23:10.050
<v Speaker 3>2008.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3289
02:23:10.051 --> 02:23:12.690
<v Speaker 3>I always did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did hard hunts by myself and Eagle</v>

3290
02:23:12.690 --> 02:23:14.550
<v Speaker 3>Cap,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's not really a great chance of</v>

3291
02:23:14.551 --> 02:23:16.230
<v Speaker 3>dying in the Eagle Cap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3292
02:23:16.231 --> 02:23:18.420
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could,</v>

3293
02:23:18.870 --> 02:23:20.160
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3294
02:23:20.940 --> 02:23:23.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I felt like I was,</v>

3295
02:23:23.580 --> 02:23:27.900
<v Speaker 3>I was given all I had on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the hunts that required the most of</v>

3296
02:23:27.901 --> 02:23:30.030
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then at that same time,</v>

3297
02:23:30.420 --> 02:23:33.120
<v Speaker 3>so that was 2007,</v>
<v Speaker 3>2008.</v>

3298
02:23:33.270 --> 02:23:36.600
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then at the same time I was also ramping</v>

3299
02:23:36.601 --> 02:23:40.800
<v Speaker 3>up what I did with running and pushing</v>
<v Speaker 3>my body 100 milers and things like that</v>

3300
02:23:41.030 --> 02:23:43.400
<v Speaker 1>because you realize that you needed more</v>
<v Speaker 1>endurance.</v>

3301
02:23:44.300 --> 02:23:46.010
<v Speaker 3>I just realized that I had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had,</v>

3302
02:23:46.340 --> 02:23:48.380
<v Speaker 3>I had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been doing what I've been telling</v>

3303
02:23:48.381 --> 02:23:50.600
<v Speaker 3>my kids not to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been coasting,</v>

3304
02:23:51.680 --> 02:23:53.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it still was more than a lot of people</v>

3305
02:23:53.450 --> 02:23:56.510
<v Speaker 3>are doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But to me it felt like I wasn't living</v>

3306
02:23:56.511 --> 02:23:58.580
<v Speaker 3>up to my full potential.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm like,</v>

3307
02:23:58.670 --> 02:23:59.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to do more.</v>

3308
02:24:00.110 --> 02:24:03.680
<v Speaker 3>And then that led to my lab and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and when I,</v>

3309
02:24:03.710 --> 02:24:07.940
<v Speaker 3>when I meet people and see people that</v>
<v Speaker 3>are doing amazing things,</v>

3310
02:24:07.941 --> 02:24:10.250
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it shows me what's possible.</v>

3311
02:24:10.280 --> 02:24:12.740
<v Speaker 3>And so that's why I know I can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have more offer.</v>

3312
02:24:13.410 --> 02:24:15.570
<v Speaker 1>That's a fascinating thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

3313
02:24:15.590 --> 02:24:20.310
<v Speaker 1>used to take these steps towards this</v>
<v Speaker 1>journey and then you realize as you're</v>

3314
02:24:20.400 --> 02:24:24.690
<v Speaker 1>making these steps that your capacity</v>
<v Speaker 1>for work is increasing.</v>

3315
02:24:24.870 --> 02:24:27.840
<v Speaker 1>So you have to push yourself further to</v>
<v Speaker 1>test your body.</v>

3316
02:24:28.140 --> 02:24:28.980
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3317
02:24:28.981 --> 02:24:30.840
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a marathon seems out of reach,</v>

3318
02:24:30.841 --> 02:24:32.850
<v Speaker 1>but then a marathon becomes a normal</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

3319
02:24:33.150 --> 02:24:38.150
<v Speaker 1>And then a 50 miler and then a hundred</v>
<v Speaker 1>miler than the 205 mile and a 238 mile</v>

3320
02:24:38.681 --> 02:24:40.170
<v Speaker 1>hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now you were talking the other day</v>

3321
02:24:40.171 --> 02:24:42.600
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess candace was considering a 500</v>

3322
02:24:42.601 --> 02:24:43.680
<v Speaker 1>miler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3323
02:24:43.681 --> 02:24:45.300
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She asked and I know,</v>

3324
02:24:45.380 --> 02:24:46.980

<v Speaker 3>like I did Moab and Courtney did she,</v>

<v Speaker 3>but she,</v>

3335
02:25:12.060 --> 02:25:13.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you can finish a finish line and</v>

3336
02:25:13.701 --> 02:25:15.080
<v Speaker 3>you're smiling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

3337
02:25:15.140 --> 02:25:16.360

<v Speaker 3>A little more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Got some more left.</v>

3339
02:25:18.280 --> 02:25:19.940
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's why,</v>

3340
02:25:20.330 --> 02:25:24.670
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sound of something epic 500</v>

3341
02:25:25.060 --> 02:25:28.930
<v Speaker 4>nonstop is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is so incredible.</v>

3342
02:25:29.020 --> 02:25:32.650
<v Speaker 4>That sounds so insane that you'd run 238</v>
<v Speaker 4>miles.</v>

3343
02:25:32.651 --> 02:25:34.960
<v Speaker 4>It'd be basically halfway done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3344
02:25:35.020 --> 02:25:36.430
<v Speaker 4>that sounds stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

3345
02:25:36.431 --> 02:25:38.950
<v Speaker 4>But listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when we were a hundred miles in,</v>

3346
02:25:39.300 --> 02:25:41.440
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a hundred miles is a long way.</v>

3347
02:25:41.441 --> 02:25:43.360
<v Speaker 4>And I told my brother was with me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Taylor.</v>

3348
02:25:43.870 --> 02:25:45.370
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3349
02:25:45.371 --> 02:25:46.750
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a different thought when you're not</v>

3350
02:25:46.751 --> 02:25:48.790
<v Speaker 4>even halfway and you've just done a</v>
<v Speaker 4>hundred.</v>

3351
02:25:49.270 --> 02:25:52.090
<v Speaker 4>100 is hertz.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3352
02:25:52.510 --> 02:25:54.760
<v Speaker 4>But you're not halfway.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's the same thing.</v>

3353
02:25:54.761 --> 02:25:55.600
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's really not that.</v>

3354
02:25:55.690 --> 02:25:58.120
<v Speaker 4>It's just a change in mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many days do you think you need to</v>

3355
02:25:58.121 --> 02:25:58.960
<v Speaker 4>run?</v>
<v Speaker 4>500.</v>

3356
02:26:00.160 --> 02:26:01.450
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I need a year.</v>

3357
02:26:01.660 --> 02:26:03.100
<v Speaker 4>Can I do that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3358
02:26:03.160 --> 02:26:05.110
<v Speaker 4>Can I have a year?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I need 10 hours of sleep at night.</v>

3359
02:26:05.111 --> 02:26:08.960
<v Speaker 4>I was listening to the Matthew Walker</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dr. Matthew Walker said 10 hours.</v>

3360
02:26:08.980 --> 02:26:10.330
<v Speaker 4>Just like God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3361
02:26:10.420 --> 02:26:12.600
<v Speaker 4>Courtney told me she slept one minute.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

3362
02:26:13.020 --> 02:26:13.853
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had,</v>

3363
02:26:14.260 --> 02:26:14.621
<v Speaker 4>I had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3364
02:26:14.621 --> 02:26:15.130
<v Speaker 4>one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3365
02:26:15.130 --> 02:26:15.670
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she,</v>

3366
02:26:15.670 --> 02:26:17.170
<v Speaker 4>she slept 27 minutes total.</v>

3367
02:26:17.170 --> 02:26:19.600
<v Speaker 4>She laid down for 20 minutes and she</v>
<v Speaker 4>couldn't sleep.</v>

3368
02:26:19.740 --> 02:26:21.400
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then the one time that she slept,</v>

3369
02:26:21.401 --> 02:26:23.470
<v Speaker 4>she slept for one minute.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did that exact,</v>

3370
02:26:23.590 --> 02:26:28.150
<v Speaker 4>Taylor was there and I did the exact</v>
<v Speaker 4>same thing for one minute because he was</v>

3371
02:26:28.151 --> 02:26:31.690
<v Speaker 4>watching the watch and I fell asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a picture and I woke up.</v>

3372
02:26:31.691 --> 02:26:33.400
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how long was I sleep?</v>

3373
02:26:33.430 --> 02:26:34.810
<v Speaker 4>He goes a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

3374
02:26:34.811 --> 02:26:36.640
<v Speaker 4>what's the go?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And for whatever reason,</v>

3375
02:26:36.641 --> 02:26:39.970
<v Speaker 4>that minute it does something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what does it do?</v>

3376
02:26:40.030 --> 02:26:40.960
<v Speaker 4>But she's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she had,</v>

3377
02:26:41.020 --> 02:26:43.210
<v Speaker 4>I don't have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Said she woke up and she was angry that</v>

3378
02:26:43.211 --> 02:26:45.610
<v Speaker 4>they let her sleep so long.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoever was there,</v>

3379
02:26:46.300 --> 02:26:47.950
<v Speaker 4>she thought it was longer and he was</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3380
02:26:47.951 --> 02:26:49.060
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you only slept for a minute.</v>

3381
02:26:49.330 --> 02:26:50.350
<v Speaker 4>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well let's go.</v>

3382
02:26:50.650 --> 02:26:51.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

3383
02:26:51.730 --> 02:26:54.250
<v Speaker 4>that's one thing I learned in that first</v>
<v Speaker 4>200 I did,</v>

3384
02:26:54.280 --> 02:26:57.760
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Richard won that race and that was a</v>

3385
02:26:57.761 --> 02:27:01.840
<v Speaker 4>mistake I made is um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was asking how,</v>

3386
02:27:01.880 --> 02:27:03.190
<v Speaker 4>how long he'd been sleeping.</v>

3387
02:27:03.370 --> 02:27:05.350
<v Speaker 4>That was what you said.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He sent me a quote,</v>

3388
02:27:05.351 --> 02:27:08.320
<v Speaker 4>but you said he'd go fucking Richard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cause he is like,</v>

3389
02:27:08.940 --> 02:27:12.460
<v Speaker 4>and he said that he says I was the</v>
<v Speaker 4>greatest day of my life and Joe Rogan</v>

3390
02:27:12.500 --> 02:27:14.440
<v Speaker 4>said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck Richard Kessler.</v>

3391
02:27:14.770 --> 02:27:15.603
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3392
02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:19.300
<v Speaker 4>but he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was sleeping short durations like 15</v>

3393
02:27:19.301 --> 02:27:22.690
<v Speaker 4>minutes and I didn't realize that your</v>
<v Speaker 4>body will reset that quick.</v>

3394
02:27:23.080 --> 02:27:25.210
<v Speaker 4>You thought you needed to like an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3395
02:27:25.250 --> 02:27:26.500

<v Speaker 4>I'm God,</v>

3399
02:27:32.231 --> 02:27:37.231
<v Speaker 4>it's really hard to be good at ultra</v>
<v Speaker 4>marathoning and also be able to want to</v>

3400

<v Speaker 4>I don't know if that's a towel,</v>

3440
02:29:21.321 --> 02:29:25.220
<v Speaker 4>but it's theirs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's having great endurance is a thing.</v>

3441
02:29:26.450 --> 02:29:28.400
<v Speaker 4>It's certainly a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3442
02:29:28.580 --> 02:29:32.240
<v Speaker 4>And managing the body to get the most</v>
<v Speaker 4>out of that endurance.</v>

3443
02:29:32.730 --> 02:29:35.930
<v Speaker 4>Most of it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is in,</v>

3444
02:29:36.050 --> 02:29:39.890
<v Speaker 4>Courtney said this too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she didn't realize how far she could</v>

3445
02:29:39.891 --> 02:29:41.990
<v Speaker 4>push in the paint shoes in.</v>

3446
02:29:41.990 --> 02:29:46.990
<v Speaker 4>So her first hundred she quit first</v>
<v Speaker 4>hundred mile or she dropped out of,</v>

3447
02:29:47.330 --> 02:29:48.650
<v Speaker 4>because she was in pain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was it.</v>

3448
02:29:49.190 --> 02:29:50.750
<v Speaker 4>And she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't do this.</v>

3449
02:29:51.020 --> 02:29:53.750
<v Speaker 4>And then she quit and she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wait a second.</v>

3450
02:29:55.010 --> 02:29:57.590
<v Speaker 4>I equipped for no reason.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I quit just because I was in pain.</v>

3451
02:29:57.770 --> 02:30:02.000
<v Speaker 4>So then after that she realized pain is</v>
<v Speaker 4>just part of the deal and has it quit</v>

3452
02:30:02.001 --> 02:30:05.630
<v Speaker 4>since.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so she just didn't realize that the</v>

3453
02:30:05.631 --> 02:30:08.450
<v Speaker 4>pain quotient of those races,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

3454
02:30:08.870 --> 02:30:11.210
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just cause the full,</v>

3455
02:30:11.230 --> 02:30:12.920
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Doesn't mean you stop.</v>

3456
02:30:12.980 --> 02:30:14.330
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3457
02:30:14.331 --> 02:30:15.320
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's,</v>

3458
02:30:15.350 --> 02:30:18.740
<v Speaker 4>that's the key.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most people can't push that push through</v>

3459
02:30:18.741 --> 02:30:20.720
<v Speaker 4>that amount of pain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It hurts,</v>

3460
02:30:21.140 --> 02:30:22.820
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the worst pain I've ever felt.</v>

3461
02:30:22.880 --> 02:30:26.720
<v Speaker 4>But what hurts the most?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It depends.</v>

3462
02:30:26.721 --> 02:30:29.210
<v Speaker 4>It's like I've run and my foot started</v>
<v Speaker 4>hurting.</v>

3463
02:30:29.211 --> 02:30:29.931
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God,</v>

3464
02:30:29.931 --> 02:30:30.290
<v Speaker 4>this is it.</v>

3465
02:30:30.290 --> 02:30:32.270
<v Speaker 4>I probably broke my foot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe stress fracture.</v>

3466
02:30:32.271 --> 02:30:33.830
<v Speaker 4>Then all of a sudden my other knee</v>
<v Speaker 4>hurts.</v>

3467
02:30:33.831 --> 02:30:34.740
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my,</v>

3468
02:30:34.850 --> 02:30:38.060
<v Speaker 4>okay my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my ligament is got tight cause I got</v>

3469
02:30:38.061 --> 02:30:40.160
<v Speaker 4>dehydrated as rubbing on my bone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's like,</v>

3470
02:30:40.190 --> 02:30:40.641
<v Speaker 4>oh wait,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3471
02:30:40.641 --> 02:30:44.330
<v Speaker 4>this other right hip hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just like everything hurts.</v>

3472
02:30:44.720 --> 02:30:46.940
<v Speaker 4>Different things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your feet get beat up,</v>

3473
02:30:46.941 --> 02:30:49.280
<v Speaker 4>you get blisters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're getting dried out.</v>

3474
02:30:49.281 --> 02:30:53.750
<v Speaker 4>So things are just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>things are different in your body.</v>

3475
02:30:54.110 --> 02:30:58.850
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I got a bone on top of my foot that</v>

3476
02:30:58.880 --> 02:31:03.260
<v Speaker 4>rubs and if I get dried out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that stuff's not sliding well enough.</v>

3477
02:31:03.261 --> 02:31:05.120
<v Speaker 4>So that rubs in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it swells up more.</v>

3478
02:31:05.121 --> 02:31:08.120
<v Speaker 4>So it's just like all sorts of things</v>
<v Speaker 4>happen.</v>

3479
02:31:09.100 --> 02:31:11.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People want everything to feel good</v>

3480
02:31:12.140 --> 02:31:13.460
<v Speaker 4>doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Felt comfortable.</v>

3481
02:31:13.580 --> 02:31:15.620
<v Speaker 4>And it does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You shouldn't push too hard for about</v>

3482
02:31:15.621 --> 02:31:17.600
<v Speaker 4>five miles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just be comfortable.</v>

3483
02:31:17.840 --> 02:31:19.040
<v Speaker 4>You should just be comfortable.</v>

3484
02:31:19.110 --> 02:31:21.630
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's the biggest thing as people.</v>

3485
02:31:22.170 --> 02:31:24.750
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

3486
02:31:24.780 --> 02:31:27.150
<v Speaker 4>there's this guy too that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's been following me.</v>

3487
02:31:27.151 --> 02:31:28.500
<v Speaker 4>I love,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love the guy.</v>

3488
02:31:28.800 --> 02:31:31.590
<v Speaker 4>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so he sees a pictures,</v>

3489
02:31:31.591 --> 02:31:33.300
<v Speaker 4>he follows along.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

3490
02:31:33.301 --> 02:31:38.280
<v Speaker 4>well I want to do a hundred miler and</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause it sounds amazing.</v>

3491
02:31:38.400 --> 02:31:40.240
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

3492
02:31:40.590 --> 02:31:44.370
<v Speaker 4>signed up to do 101 my brother just just</v>
<v Speaker 4>did recently.</v>

3493
02:31:44.400 --> 02:31:48.660
<v Speaker 4>It's called Badger Mountain and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hadn't done it before.</v>

3494
02:31:48.661 --> 02:31:51.390
<v Speaker 4>I think he came and ran Pisca did about</v>
<v Speaker 4>four summers,</v>

3495
02:31:51.391 --> 02:31:56.391
<v Speaker 4>one's about 16 miles or whatever and</v>
<v Speaker 4>went out and he's going to do a hundred</v>

3496
02:31:56.840 --> 02:31:59.650
<v Speaker 4>mile or after that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

3497
02:32:00.570 --> 02:32:04.800
<v Speaker 4>started throwing up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But like mile 30 threw up like 13 times</v>

3498
02:32:05.220 --> 02:32:10.220
<v Speaker 4>and couldn't walk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was dehydrated throwing up and it was a</v>

3499
02:32:10.621 --> 02:32:14.340
<v Speaker 4>hardest thing to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he had to drop and that,</v>

3500
02:32:14.670 --> 02:32:19.670
<v Speaker 4>so there's your getting your body to a</v>
<v Speaker 4>place where you can run that far and</v>

3501
02:32:19.681 --> 02:32:20.830
<v Speaker 4>then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that's part,</v>

3502
02:32:20.850 --> 02:32:21.900
<v Speaker 4>he hasn't been there yet.</v>

3503
02:32:21.930 --> 02:32:24.030
<v Speaker 4>And I think part of that was he wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>taking his salt.</v>

3504
02:32:24.031 --> 02:32:26.520
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of things that go on with pushing</v>

3505
02:32:26.521 --> 02:32:30.180
<v Speaker 4>your body that hard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he got 50 miles done for,</v>

3506
02:32:30.330 --> 02:32:32.520
<v Speaker 4>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought that was a great success</v>

3507
02:32:32.820 --> 02:32:37.820
<v Speaker 4>because just people just because they</v>
<v Speaker 4>want to run a hundred doesn't mess</v>

3508
02:32:37.980 --> 02:32:40.890
<v Speaker 4>necessarily mean you're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of things that have to go</v>

3509
02:32:40.900 --> 02:32:44.760
<v Speaker 4>into preparation and the tactics and</v>
<v Speaker 4>fueling and everything else.</v>

3510
02:32:44.910 --> 02:32:47.580
<v Speaker 4>Learning just like courtney did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>learning just like he did,</v>

3511
02:32:47.581 --> 02:32:50.040
<v Speaker 4>he got 50 in and now we signed up for</v>
<v Speaker 4>big foot,</v>

3512
02:32:50.610 --> 02:32:55.610
<v Speaker 4>so he's going to do 205 miles you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so he's going from dropping out at 5,205</v>

3513
02:32:55.981 --> 02:32:56.814
<v Speaker 4>miles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>

3514
02:32:56.910 --> 02:32:58.770
<v Speaker 4>And I think he can do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a sickness.</v>

3515
02:32:58.950 --> 02:33:02.430
<v Speaker 4>You guys are all sick in the head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd guys are all getting sick together.</v>

3516
02:33:02.580 --> 02:33:03.810
<v Speaker 4>I think he can do it.</v>

3517
02:33:03.840 --> 02:33:06.240
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's just as part of the process</v>

3518
02:33:06.241 --> 02:33:10.350
<v Speaker 4>of learning what you're capable of and</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not,</v>

3519
02:33:10.860 --> 02:33:13.620
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't happen like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you say take the salts and like</v>

3520
02:33:13.621 --> 02:33:14.700
<v Speaker 4>what are you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are you doing?</v>

3521
02:33:15.340 --> 02:33:16.650
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're called s caps,</v>

3522
02:33:16.651 --> 02:33:19.440
<v Speaker 4>so it's just salt pills.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I thought saw,</v>

3523
02:33:19.480 --> 02:33:21.180
<v Speaker 4>gives you high blood pressure and it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>bad for you.</v>

3524
02:33:21.990 --> 02:33:22.540
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

3525
02:33:22.540 --> 02:33:24.960
<v Speaker 4>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when you're sweating nonstop,</v>

3526
02:33:25.170 --> 02:33:26.880
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't give you high blood pressure</v>
<v Speaker 4>folks.</v>

3527
02:33:26.920 --> 02:33:28.380
<v Speaker 4>It's not bad for you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3528
02:33:28.381 --> 02:33:33.381
<v Speaker 4>So it's a fucking bad study from like</v>
<v Speaker 4>the 1970s that people recite salts in a</v>

3529
02:33:33.571 --> 02:33:34.950
<v Speaker 4>central mineral.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3530
02:33:34.951 --> 02:33:37.000
<v Speaker 4>so when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're doing it,</v>

3531
02:33:37.001 --> 02:33:38.730
<v Speaker 4>how much you taken in it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Take,</v>

3532
02:33:38.760 --> 02:33:41.010
<v Speaker 4>I take salt every hour.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And how much salt?</v>

3533
02:33:41.070 --> 02:33:43.620
<v Speaker 4>Couple pill.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Couple of capsules of s caps.</v>

3534
02:33:43.650 --> 02:33:46.860
<v Speaker 4>So it's a couple of capsules and if you</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't,</v>

3535
02:33:47.460 --> 02:33:49.470
<v Speaker 4>you won't make it really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

3536
02:33:50.520 --> 02:33:51.870
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nope.</v>

3537
02:33:52.440 --> 02:33:54.780
<v Speaker 4>So it's just your body just gets too</v>
<v Speaker 4>dehydrated.</v>

3538
02:33:54.970 --> 02:33:56.100
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Two deficient.</v>

3539
02:33:56.370 --> 02:33:58.950
<v Speaker 4>And what is the water in the salt?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like how does it,</v>

3540
02:33:58.980 --> 02:33:59.813
<v Speaker 4>what does it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what does,</v>

3541
02:33:59.850 --> 02:34:01.350
<v Speaker 4>what's happening when you're taking</v>
<v Speaker 4>salt?</v>

3542
02:34:02.090 --> 02:34:03.240
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I dunno,</v>

3543
02:34:04.170 --> 02:34:05.340
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody does it.</v>

3544
02:34:05.370 --> 02:34:06.480
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3545
02:34:06.600 --> 02:34:08.880
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but all I know is like,</v>

3546
02:34:09.240 --> 02:34:13.830
<v Speaker 4>I remember the first time I did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>western states had only done it once,</v>

3547
02:34:13.831 --> 02:34:18.831
<v Speaker 4>but it was a 100 miler in 2010 and I got</v>
<v Speaker 4>to mile 55 I think.</v>

3548
02:34:19.901 --> 02:34:23.390
<v Speaker 4>And I was dragging ass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You come out of the canyons a super hot</v>

3549
02:34:23.391 --> 02:34:24.550
<v Speaker 4>and there is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3550
02:34:24.580 --> 02:34:29.580
<v Speaker 4>nineties or a hundred it's in the canyon</v>
<v Speaker 4>so he can pop out on to mile 55 and I</v>

3551
02:34:29.891 --> 02:34:34.891
<v Speaker 4>was hurting and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and Sean mize and her who's been a very</v>

3552

3555
02:34:42.880 --> 02:34:46.390

<v Speaker 4>biggest difference that just salt.</v>

3571
02:35:36.160 --> 02:35:38.290
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3572
02:35:38.291 --> 02:35:40.270
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of evolving right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hundreds.</v>

3573
02:35:40.310 --> 02:35:45.310
<v Speaker 4>The two hundreds are and it's evolving</v>
<v Speaker 4>based on how far people can that are</v>

3574

3575
02:35:50.411 --> 02:35:54.070
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when this 500 does take place,</v>

3576

<v Speaker 4>I've terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've definitely terrible.</v>

3589
02:36:18.521 --> 02:36:19.354
<v Speaker 4>At business.</v>

3590
02:36:20.650 --> 02:36:22.030
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't be good at everything.</v>

3591
02:36:22.300 --> 02:36:23.350
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a fact.</v>

3592
02:36:23.590 --> 02:36:27.490
<v Speaker 4>It's not possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The number one thing I hate more than</v>

3593
02:36:27.491 --> 02:36:30.310
<v Speaker 4>anything is when business screws up my</v>
<v Speaker 4>passions.</v>

3594
02:36:30.610 --> 02:36:35.410
<v Speaker 4>So when I hate the business of hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it sounds weird because I'm probably</v>

3595
02:36:35.411 --> 02:36:37.240
<v Speaker 4>sitting here because of the business of</v>
<v Speaker 4>hunting,</v>

3596
02:36:37.540 --> 02:36:39.810
<v Speaker 4>but I can't stand it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know what you're saying.</v>

3597
02:36:40.060 --> 02:36:43.660
<v Speaker 4>The business of like the industry</v>
<v Speaker 4>involved in hunting gear,</v>

3598
02:36:43.750 --> 02:36:45.350
<v Speaker 4>it goods and all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3599
02:36:46.010 --> 02:36:47.560
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love hunting.</v>

3600
02:36:47.590 --> 02:36:51.970
<v Speaker 4>I love the connection with animals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love doing what I do and I know I have</v>

3601
02:36:51.971 --> 02:36:53.410
<v Speaker 4>value.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get it.</v>

3602
02:36:53.440 --> 02:36:55.780
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have value because it put my name on</v>

3603
02:36:55.781 --> 02:36:58.390
<v Speaker 4>stuff and they sell it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hate it.</v>

3604
02:37:00.010 --> 02:37:02.080
<v Speaker 4>That's probably what you're good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I Dunno.</v>

3605
02:37:02.560 --> 02:37:05.050
<v Speaker 4>I think those two are correlated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

3606
02:37:05.140 --> 02:37:08.170
<v Speaker 4>I'm fucking terrible at the business</v>
<v Speaker 4>part of comedy,</v>

3607
02:37:08.800 --> 02:37:09.670
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3608
02:37:09.700 --> 02:37:11.440
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just want to do it.</v>

3609
02:37:11.830 --> 02:37:13.870
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't like thinking about the money</v>

3610
02:37:13.871 --> 02:37:14.681
<v Speaker 4>part.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3611
02:37:14.681 --> 02:37:16.220
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's why I have managers</v>

3612
02:37:16.220 --> 02:37:17.120
<v Speaker 1>and agents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3613
02:37:17.150 --> 02:37:19.400
<v Speaker 1>They take care of everything so that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>can just be free.</v>

3614
02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:22.550
<v Speaker 1>And if you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3615
02:37:22.551 --> 02:37:24.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you only have certain amount of</v>

3616
02:37:24.531 --> 02:37:28.340
<v Speaker 1>resources and if you put all your</v>
<v Speaker 1>resources into the business side,</v>

3617
02:37:28.730 --> 02:37:32.000
<v Speaker 1>how are you going to have the</v>
<v Speaker 1>concentration to do all the other things</v>

3618
02:37:32.001 --> 02:37:32.930
<v Speaker 1>you're doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3619
02:37:33.110 --> 02:37:35.010
<v Speaker 1>Practice shooting and running,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the,</v>

3620
02:37:35.080 --> 02:37:38.030
<v Speaker 1>all the different things all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll fuck with your head too.</v>

3621
02:37:38.420 --> 02:37:41.270
<v Speaker 1>You got to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is one of the things that I was</v>

3622
02:37:41.271 --> 02:37:44.090
<v Speaker 1>thinking of when my phone didn't work</v>
<v Speaker 1>for four days or three days,</v>

3623
02:37:44.091 --> 02:37:47.870
<v Speaker 1>whatever it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was that how much time I'm wasting,</v>

3624
02:37:48.980 --> 02:37:50.870
<v Speaker 1>how much energy I'm wasting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3625
02:37:50.960 --> 02:37:55.960
<v Speaker 1>Like you can only interact so much with</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people's thoughts and ideas and</v>

3626
02:37:57.741 --> 02:38:02.741
<v Speaker 1>information and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a lot of things already in your</v>

3627
02:38:03.171 --> 02:38:08.171
<v Speaker 1>head that you're going over and thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about and managing and the more shit you</v>

3628
02:38:11.360 --> 02:38:15.380
<v Speaker 1>stuff in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't make you better at doing</v>

3629
02:38:15.381 --> 02:38:16.430
<v Speaker 1>those original things.</v>

3630
02:38:16.560 --> 02:38:17.930
<v Speaker 1>It dilutes it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3631
02:38:18.320 --> 02:38:20.930
<v Speaker 1>And it also diluted my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my peace of mind.</v>

3632
02:38:21.250 --> 02:38:24.560
<v Speaker 1>Like</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you know,</v>

3633
02:38:24.561 --> 02:38:26.720
<v Speaker 1>did you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you only have certain amount of</v>

3634
02:38:26.721 --> 02:38:29.660
<v Speaker 1>resources in your life and you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>choose what's important to you and</v>

3635
02:38:29.661 --> 02:38:30.950
<v Speaker 1>what's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3636
02:38:30.951 --> 02:38:33.320
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's real easy to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>distracted.</v>

3637
02:38:33.710 --> 02:38:37.160
<v Speaker 1>It's real easy to flood your brain with</v>
<v Speaker 1>nonsense.</v>

3638
02:38:37.190 --> 02:38:38.870
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3639
02:38:39.170 --> 02:38:40.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

3640
02:38:41.180 --> 02:38:44.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm good at a few things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I try to focus on those.</v>

3641
02:38:45.050 --> 02:38:46.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

3642
02:38:46.161 --> 02:38:47.600
<v Speaker 1>and that the business part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3643
02:38:47.601 --> 02:38:49.700
<v Speaker 1>You can take that over for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3644
02:38:49.701 --> 02:38:51.800
<v Speaker 1>I'll take it over for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even good at it,</v>

3645
02:38:51.801 --> 02:38:55.970
<v Speaker 1>but I'm good at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm good at what I'm good at is I know</v>

3646

3650
02:39:09.650 --> 02:39:13.730
<v Speaker 1>unexpected and peripheral,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of them is the ability to make</v>

<v Speaker 2>that's when it hit me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck?</v>

3781
02:44:42.851 --> 02:44:46.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm reaching like middle aged ladies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3782
02:44:46.340 --> 02:44:49.990
<v Speaker 2>It's past the middle aged ladies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If she lives to be 120 that's a hell of</v>

3783
02:44:49.991 --> 02:44:50.824
<v Speaker 2>a lady.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3784
02:44:50.850 --> 02:44:52.720
<v Speaker 2>cause we're middle age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're middle age.</v>

3785
02:44:52.780 --> 02:44:55.850
<v Speaker 2>If everything goes perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3786
02:44:55.960 --> 02:44:58.150
<v Speaker 2>But with science today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're probably not even,</v>

3787
02:44:58.151 --> 02:45:00.190
<v Speaker 2>I think we're probably one third aged.</v>

3788
02:45:00.530 --> 02:45:03.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's 100% easy today that</v>

3789
02:45:03.551 --> 02:45:06.040
<v Speaker 2>someone's going to live to be one 50 I</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't think there's any question</v>

3790
02:45:06.041 --> 02:45:07.180
<v Speaker 2>whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3791
02:45:07.300 --> 02:45:11.260
<v Speaker 2>What stem cell treatments and all this</v>
<v Speaker 2>other crazy nutter 50 yup.</v>

3792
02:45:11.680 --> 02:45:12.513
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that.</v>

3793
02:45:12.760 --> 02:45:16.960
<v Speaker 2>I believe people that are alive today</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I think technology and medical</v>

3794
02:45:16.961 --> 02:45:21.961
<v Speaker 2>science is increasing its viability and</v>
<v Speaker 2>its potential so fast and there's so</v>

3795
02:45:23.501 --> 02:45:26.440
<v Speaker 2>many people working on things all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time that if you do everything right</v>

3796
02:45:26.441 --> 02:45:28.450
<v Speaker 2>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're going to see people that</v>

3797
02:45:28.451 --> 02:45:31.260
<v Speaker 2>are alive today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to hit one 50 and I think</v>

3798
02:45:31.300 --> 02:45:34.060
<v Speaker 2>the people that are born like five years</v>
<v Speaker 2>from now,</v>

3799
02:45:34.061 --> 02:45:39.061
<v Speaker 2>10 years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll probably hit 200 um whoa before</v>

3800
02:45:39.701 --> 02:45:42.670
<v Speaker 2>we go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before we go Chicago,</v>

3801
02:45:43.060 --> 02:45:44.770
<v Speaker 2>UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ooh it's going to be a good one.</v>

3802
02:45:45.250 --> 02:45:47.340
<v Speaker 2>Colby Covington don't snap me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Slap me.</v>

3803
02:45:47.810 --> 02:45:48.940
<v Speaker 2>And he said you're going to slap me.</v>

3804
02:45:49.090 --> 02:45:50.770
<v Speaker 2>Slap me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's talking shit.</v>

3805
02:45:50.790 --> 02:45:51.940
<v Speaker 2>Lice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You going to slap you.</v>

3806
02:45:52.310 --> 02:45:54.670
<v Speaker 2>Cause I was telling them that Jon Jones</v>
<v Speaker 2>might slap him.</v>

3807
02:45:54.790 --> 02:45:58.060
<v Speaker 2>Oh</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like colby.</v>

3808
02:45:58.120 --> 02:46:00.580
<v Speaker 2>I like what he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's talking a lot of shit.</v>

3809
02:46:00.581 --> 02:46:02.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying be careful who you talk</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit to.</v>

3810
02:46:02.860 --> 02:46:05.950
<v Speaker 2>Talking Shit to Jon Jones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the baddest motherfucker has ever</v>

3811
02:46:05.951 --> 02:46:09.100
<v Speaker 2>lived.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know he's making a lot of money.</v>

3812
02:46:09.230 --> 02:46:11.900
<v Speaker 2>He's being smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh cold reason why colby is fighting for</v>

3813
02:46:11.901 --> 02:46:13.790
<v Speaker 2>the title.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reason why Colby is going to fight</v>

3814
02:46:13.791 --> 02:46:18.570
<v Speaker 2>Hofeld dos Anjos for the interim title</v>
<v Speaker 2>is not just because he's beaten good</v>

3815
02:46:18.571 --> 02:46:20.690
<v Speaker 2>guys cause he has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he beat Damien Maia.</v>

3816
02:46:20.870 --> 02:46:24.170
<v Speaker 2>But it's more importantly that he's got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's gonna put asses in the seats.</v>

3817
02:46:24.470 --> 02:46:27.260
<v Speaker 2>Well that's part of the fight business</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of the fight business.</v>

3818
02:46:27.261 --> 02:46:28.640
<v Speaker 2>Now you've got to sell it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3819
02:46:28.641 --> 02:46:30.770
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in pre and post conor</v>

3820
02:46:30.771 --> 02:46:31.730
<v Speaker 2>mcgregor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3821
02:46:32.090 --> 02:46:34.970
<v Speaker 2>And Post conor Mcgregor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fucking game has changed.</v>

3822
02:46:34.970 --> 02:46:38.270
<v Speaker 2>It's red panties night baby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything is different.</v>

3823
02:46:38.390 --> 02:46:39.770
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's just like,</v>

3824
02:46:39.950 --> 02:46:42.890
<v Speaker 2>I see people hate on it on Colby for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3825
02:46:43.100 --> 02:46:46.700
<v Speaker 2>did he deserve the shot at all?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know is he wins one fight.</v>

3826
02:46:46.940 --> 02:46:49.250
<v Speaker 2>He's holding the belt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3827
02:46:49.280 --> 02:46:53.690
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you look at one more beaten,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pull up his record.</v>

3828
02:46:53.691 --> 02:46:56.150
<v Speaker 2>Let me see his record.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look at who he's beaten in</v>

3829
02:46:56.151 --> 02:46:58.160
<v Speaker 2>comparison to somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's some people that have been</v>

3830
02:46:58.161 --> 02:47:00.620
<v Speaker 2>calling him out that can't get a fight</v>
<v Speaker 2>with him,</v>

3831
02:47:01.010 --> 02:47:04.010
<v Speaker 2>like a Camaro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uzman wants to fight him and that guy is</v>

3832
02:47:04.011 --> 02:47:06.770
<v Speaker 2>a beast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's some other guys that</v>

3833
02:47:06.771 --> 02:47:11.771
<v Speaker 2>are really talented but haven't beaten</v>
<v Speaker 2>like any high level guys yet.</v>

3834
02:47:13.340 --> 02:47:14.091
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

3835
02:47:14.091 --> 02:47:18.080
<v Speaker 2>So we lost a warley Alvarez and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at the guys he's beaten.</v>

3836
02:47:18.110 --> 02:47:21.130
<v Speaker 2>Brian Barbarian is a good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dumb Young Kim is a,</v>

3837
02:47:21.131 --> 02:47:23.420
<v Speaker 2>as a tough guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stung on cam and Damien Maia.</v>

3838
02:47:23.630 --> 02:47:26.840
<v Speaker 2>That is not really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm just going to be honest.</v>

3839
02:47:27.140 --> 02:47:32.140
<v Speaker 2>This is not a resume of someone who you</v>
<v Speaker 2>would normally see fighting for the</v>

3840
02:47:33.531 --> 02:47:36.320
<v Speaker 2>title right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's fighting for the title</v>

3841
02:47:36.321 --> 02:47:39.710
<v Speaker 2>based,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just on his beat beating Damien</v>

3842
02:47:39.710 --> 02:47:41.030
<v Speaker 2>Maia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's a really tough guy.</v>

3843
02:47:41.720 --> 02:47:46.640
<v Speaker 2>But I think on the fact that he's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>controversial,</v>

3844
02:47:46.670 --> 02:47:51.670
<v Speaker 2>very popular character.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does he talk so much shit and because</v>

3845
02:47:52.071 --> 02:47:55.780
<v Speaker 2>he's talked so much shit about</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brazilians and he dominated my,</v>

3846
02:47:55.790 --> 02:47:58.010
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was,</v>

3847
02:47:58.220 --> 02:48:00.690
<v Speaker 2>it was a domination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He dominated them and it's uh,</v>

3848
02:48:00.880 --> 02:48:02.300
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I was a big victory,</v>

3849
02:48:02.330 --> 02:48:06.650
<v Speaker 2>but that was his only big victory over a</v>
<v Speaker 2>titled a former title Challenger.</v>

3850
02:48:06.651 --> 02:48:08.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's like a top level guy who was also</v>

3851
02:48:08.511 --> 02:48:09.720
<v Speaker 2>40 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3852
02:48:09.770 --> 02:48:12.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean Damien Maia is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his best days are behind him.</v>

3853
02:48:12.560 --> 02:48:15.770
<v Speaker 2>Just as I say this as a huge Damien Maia</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fan.</v>

3854
02:48:16.520 --> 02:48:17.241
<v Speaker 2>Well I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3855
02:48:17.241 --> 02:48:22.241
<v Speaker 2>I look at it is you can't take too much</v>
<v Speaker 2>away from colby because I think of a lot</v>

3856
02:48:22.251 --> 02:48:27.251
<v Speaker 2>of great fighters say so if you say nate</v>
<v Speaker 2>Diaz who's been an icon for years,</v>

3857
02:48:27.411 --> 02:48:29.960
<v Speaker 2>one of my favorite of all time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's never fought for a title.</v>

3858
02:48:30.220 --> 02:48:31.250
<v Speaker 2>MM,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3859
02:48:32.030 --> 02:48:33.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

3860
02:48:33.250 --> 02:48:36.230
<v Speaker 2>So if colby got there however he got</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

3861
02:48:36.440 --> 02:48:39.050
<v Speaker 2>he wins one more fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's holding that belt.</v>

3862
02:48:39.530 --> 02:48:43.970
<v Speaker 2>I think about fighters who've come up</v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe if they've been quiet or maybe</v>

3863
02:48:43.971 --> 02:48:47.690
<v Speaker 2>they haven't sold their fights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe like as as well as colby has.</v>

3864
02:48:48.380 --> 02:48:52.010
<v Speaker 2>And so they've been grinding it out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beating good guys.</v>

3865
02:48:52.040 --> 02:48:53.960
<v Speaker 2>Maybe because they've taken that slow</v>
<v Speaker 2>road.</v>

3866
02:48:54.080 --> 02:48:56.250
<v Speaker 2>Maybe somebody who gets lucky in one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>these fights and,</v>

3867
02:48:56.450 --> 02:48:59.640
<v Speaker 2>and catches him on the Chin and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>there two rungs back and then they got</v>

3868
02:48:59.641 --> 02:49:00.860
<v Speaker 2>to grind all the way back up.</v>

3869
02:49:01.040 --> 02:49:02.780
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot of damaged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're taking,</v>

3870
02:49:02.990 --> 02:49:06.260
<v Speaker 2>we're colby didn't have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he played the game the right way</v>

3871
02:49:06.261 --> 02:49:08.300
<v Speaker 2>for today and it's paying off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3872
02:49:08.301 --> 02:49:09.810
<v Speaker 2>You want to is one loss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3873
02:49:09.811 --> 02:49:13.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think he's 11 and one now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

3874
02:49:13.350 --> 02:49:16.980
<v Speaker 2>but other people would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well look at guys like Anderson Silva</v>

3875
02:49:16.981 --> 02:49:18.930
<v Speaker 2>didn't talk any shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just fuck people up,</v>

3876
02:49:19.440 --> 02:49:20.220
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

3877
02:49:20.220 --> 02:49:23.190
<v Speaker 2>and became one of the greatest of all</v>
<v Speaker 2>time because of that.</v>

3878
02:49:23.220 --> 02:49:24.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>

3879
02:49:24.300 --> 02:49:25.290
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could,</v>

3880
02:49:25.320 --> 02:49:28.080
<v Speaker 2>you could look at it like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you want to get that shot at the</v>

3881
02:49:28.081 --> 02:49:31.200
<v Speaker 2>title or do you want to be the greatest</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's ever done it?</v>

3882
02:49:31.230 --> 02:49:32.940
<v Speaker 2>Like how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the difference?</v>

3883
02:49:32.970 --> 02:49:35.930
<v Speaker 2>I would rather get the title and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>show them the craters.</v>

3884
02:49:37.230 --> 02:49:38.930
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not mutually exclusive now.</v>

3885
02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:39.833
<v Speaker 2>Right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3886
02:49:40.020 --> 02:49:44.430
<v Speaker 2>So I mean if he wins then he'll probably</v>
<v Speaker 2>get it a fight with Woodley.</v>

3887
02:49:44.900 --> 02:49:45.330
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3888
02:49:45.330 --> 02:49:48.880
<v Speaker 2>he will definitely get a fight with</v>
<v Speaker 2>Woodley if he wins 100% right.</v>

3889
02:49:49.180 --> 02:49:50.910
<v Speaker 2>So what if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if that happens?</v>

3890
02:49:50.911 --> 02:49:52.950
<v Speaker 2>And what if Woodley showed a video</v>
<v Speaker 2>today?</v>

3891
02:49:52.951 --> 02:49:55.500
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know if I'm the of</v>

<v Speaker 2>looks like a fucking killer again.</v>

02:55:04.040 --> 02:55:08.180
<v Speaker 1>a world beater at one 70 and he's been</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to fight Woodley and he just beat</v>
