00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:04.590
Hey everybody,

2
00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.920
all of you talking to you.
What's going on.

3
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:10.920
This episode of the podcast is brought to you by blue apron.

4
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.270
Blue Apron is one of our latest and greatest podcast sponsors and it's a very

5
00:00:15.271 --> 00:00:16.320
interesting concept.

6
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.370
What they're doing is they're sending you ingredients,

7
00:00:20.371 --> 00:00:23.250
fresh ingredients in like a cooler.

8
00:00:23.251 --> 00:00:28.251
It's all chilled and shit and it's along with all the wars.

9
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.410
We're adjusting microphones here.
You good?
Uh,

10
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.450
they're sending you a cooler with all the ingredients for fresh meals along with

11
00:00:39.511 --> 00:00:44.460
ingredients.
Uh,
they have these step by step instructions,

12
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.270
the recipe with visual instructions on how to create fantastic meals.

13
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.810
And here's how it works for $9 and 99 cents a meal.

14
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.070
And these are excellent meals.

15
00:00:56.071 --> 00:00:59.460
They'll send you all the ingredients and the exact right proportions,

16
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.190
simple recipe instructions right to your door.

17
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:07.230
Meals are between 500 and 700 calories per serving and they,

18
00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:08.610
it would,
when you're eating it,

19
00:01:08.611 --> 00:01:11.070
you would think that it's a lot more because they're very delicious.

20
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.570
It's the yummy stuff that they've done it.

21
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.680
They've done a really excellent job and they've made everything completely idiot

22
00:01:16.681 --> 00:01:21.210
proof.
That step by step instructions with pictures.
It's fun.
It's fun to do.
It's,

23
00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.810
it's really,
I've enjoyed it.
I'm really getting a kick out of it.

Uh,
I love when someone comes up with a new concept,

27
00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:44.490
like a completely different idea that I haven't heard before.
And uh,

28
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.150
this is one of them.
Uh,
poultry,
fish,
meat,

29
00:01:48.151 --> 00:01:53.151
vegetables for like for this week I got oven fried chicken with corn and bean

30
00:01:54.541 --> 00:01:58.950
salad,
shrimp,
lobster rolls,
lamb p and mint.

31
00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.570
I can't even say this word or re charrettes.
How's that?
O.

T e only tell you something.
Blue Apron.

33
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.370
This is America.
Okay.
America.
We demand simplicity.

34
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.110
We don't want any fucking foreign names.

35
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.470
What does that as pasta or ketty pasta or Ketty.

36
00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.830
Thanks so or Ketty they'll look right or Chetty or chatting,

37
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.560
whatever it is,
purple spring onions and lemons.

38
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.630
The point is this and does not bland food.

39
00:02:27.631 --> 00:02:31.380
This is really like gourmet food that you can cook yourself and it's healthy and

40
00:02:31.381 --> 00:02:35.610
it's low in calories and it's really excellent and the quality of their

41
00:02:35.611 --> 00:02:38.020
ingredients.
I was pretty impressed by.
Uh,

42
00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.710
I was looking at all the stuff like the cuts of meat,
the fish,

43
00:02:40.711 --> 00:02:43.740
everything's super fresh and delicious and I love the idea.

44
00:02:43.741 --> 00:02:45.310
Like a lot of us are super busy.

45
00:02:45.311 --> 00:02:50.311
You don't have time to go to a store and buy a recipe book and then write down

46
00:02:51.241 --> 00:02:54.270
all the shit that you need to buy and measure it out and weigh it out.

47
00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.800
Blue Apron takes care of all the steps,
the shopping,
the,

48
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:00.010

It's easy to do.
I'm no chef.

52
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.110
I put them together.
And uh,
like I said,
it's quite yummy.

53
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.900
So give it a shot and I guarantee you will enjoy it.

54
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.550
Blue apron.com/rogan that's for two free meals,

55
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.580
blue apron.com/rogan we're also brought to you by [inaudible] dot com that's o n

56
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.430
n I t on it is a human optimization website and what we do is we sell you things

57
00:03:33.851 --> 00:03:37.930
that we think can improve your mind and prove your body.

58
00:03:37.931 --> 00:03:42.931
Anything that we can find that we use that helps physical fitness helps.

59
00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.020
There's,
there's supplements that help endurance.
There's a,

60
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.290
there's a product called a quarter steps mushroom that shroom tech sport is

61
00:03:50.291 --> 00:03:55.120
based on as one of my favorite supplements and I actually get really bummed out

62
00:03:55.121 --> 00:03:56.920
if I go to the gym and I realized that I haven't had it,

63
00:03:56.921 --> 00:03:57.970
I didn't put it in my bag.

64
00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.260
Shroom tech is based on this mushroom that the Chinese Olympic team started

65
00:04:02.261 --> 00:04:04.810
using and they were winning all these metals and the,

66
00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:09.811
the idea behind the cordyceps mushroom is they found a long time ago,

67
00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.870
these ancient cattle herders would,
they would go to high elevation.

68
00:04:13.871 --> 00:04:18.340
They found that these cows would be noticeably more lively when they would be

69
00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:22.510
eating the certain mushrooms.
And these mushrooms are cordyceps mushrooms.

70
00:04:22.511 --> 00:04:26.420
In 1993,
the Beijing Summer Games,
uh,
the,

71
00:04:26.421 --> 00:04:31.090
the Chinese long distance women's track team was running at a punishing full

72
00:04:31.091 --> 00:04:33.340
marathon every day in preparation.

73
00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.500
Several world records later and after extensive doping test,

74
00:04:37.501 --> 00:04:41.530
everything came up negative.
And the coach,
coach Ma,

75
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.880
that's a real name revealed that it was cordyceps mushrooms,
cordyceps,
sinensis.

76
00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.080
Um,
a lot of this stuff,
uh,
when it comes to,
you know,
any,

77
00:04:50.081 --> 00:04:54.170
any grand claims,
uh,
a lot of this stuff is,
uh,

78
00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.380
like understandably controversial.
And for that reason,
if you go to on it,

79
00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:04.220
all of the supplements that we sell have a research pages for a,

80
00:05:04.221 --> 00:05:04.931
all of them,

81
00:05:04.931 --> 00:05:09.931
including all the links to peer reviewed studies based on all the different

82
00:05:10.001 --> 00:05:12.160
individual ingredients,
whether it's for Alpha brain,

83
00:05:12.161 --> 00:05:14.920
whether it's for shroom tech or any of the,
any of the supplements.

84
00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:20.170
There's a reason why people use this stuff.
And it's not just anecdotal evidence,

85
00:05:20.171 --> 00:05:22.390
not just based on personal experiences,

86
00:05:22.391 --> 00:05:24.070
but there's actual science behind all of it.

87
00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.550
So if you go read the stuff and check it out,
you'll,

88
00:05:27.551 --> 00:05:30.220
you'll understand what we're talking about as far as fitness equipment.

89
00:05:30.221 --> 00:05:33.370
We're selling the very best strength and conditioning equipment we can.

90
00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:37.270
We're selling all this stuff that has been shown to Incruse increase what they

91
00:05:37.271 --> 00:05:39.040
call functional strength,

92
00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:44.070
functional strength meaning strength that you can use for a athletic endeavors.

93
00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:49.300
Meaning it uses your whole body as an individual unit,
which is really where um,

94
00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.290
strength and conditioning is in the 21st century.
He used to be a long time ago,

95
00:05:53.291 --> 00:05:58.291
the people used to do a lot of isolation exercises like curls

96
00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.590
<v 0>and a lot of doing tricep extensions,</v>

97
00:06:00.591 --> 00:06:03.620
all these different things that would strengthen a particular muscle group and

98
00:06:03.621 --> 00:06:07.430
you would do like back on Wednesday and then you would do buys and tries on

99
00:06:07.431 --> 00:06:09.890
Thursday.
People don't really do that stuff anymore.

100
00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:14.180
Now it's using your entire body as one unit.
And in doing so,

101
00:06:14.181 --> 00:06:18.470
what you do is you teach your body how to move heavyweights,

102
00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:23.090
how to do large amounts of work and how to do it in coordination.

103
00:06:23.091 --> 00:06:26.450
So whether it's using sand bags that we sell,

104
00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:29.930
whether it's using steel maces,
which is,
it looks like a weapon,

105
00:06:29.931 --> 00:06:30.591
but it's really a,

106
00:06:30.591 --> 00:06:35.591
just this large steel ball at the end of this long metal pipe and moving it

107
00:06:35.751 --> 00:06:37.790
around is incredibly awkward and doing so you,

108
00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:40.790
you use all these strange muscles and it's um,

109
00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:44.900
it's really excellent as far as like a direct correlation between the work that

110
00:06:44.901 --> 00:06:49.100
you put in the gym and physical performance in any athletic endeavor or just

111
00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.780
having a stronger,
healthier body.

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.160
<v 3>Thanks for doing this.
I really appreciate it.
Awesome to be here.</v>

122
00:07:29.161 --> 00:07:30.030
Thanks for having me on.

123
00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:34.030
<v 0>Have you,
you got a killer youtube page man.
And um,
you know,</v>

124
00:07:34.031 --> 00:07:36.760
I love when I can find out about a youtube page.

125
00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:40.420
Like if you go to some of your videos and you know,
you're like,

126
00:07:40.421 --> 00:07:44.950
well what does this video,
and you go,
holy shit,
it's video's got 726,000 hits.

127
00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:49.810
Other ones have millions.
What this one,
what if the earth stops spinning?

128
00:07:49.811 --> 00:07:54.310
4 million to 185,279 hits,

129
00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:58.630
which is just a testament to how fascinating these videos are and how

130
00:07:58.631 --> 00:07:59.290
interesting.

131
00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:03.220
And I think it's really cool that something that's educational and something

132
00:08:03.221 --> 00:08:05.680
that people can learn from and it's,
it's you're,

133
00:08:05.681 --> 00:08:07.440
you're getting incredibly popular because of it.
Yeah.

134
00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:08.880
<v 3>Isn't that amazing?
It's crazy.</v>

135
00:08:08.881 --> 00:08:12.150
For 4 million people wanted to learn about how the earth spun and what would

136
00:08:12.151 --> 00:08:16.110
happen if it didn't.
It's not going to stop spinning,
but the physics behind

137
00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:20.430
what if you were stopped spinning are fascinating and it makes you think about

138
00:08:20.431 --> 00:08:23.280
the world and sort of appreciate the things you don't even think about.
Way More.

139
00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:25.630
<v 0>Yeah.
The physics of the spinning earth.</v>

140
00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:28.900
It's very bizarre when you stop to think that the idea,

141
00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:34.410
all planets are constantly spinning in this weird way around a giant Sun and

142
00:08:34.751 --> 00:08:38.830
this outer planets and they're all spinning and like that.

143
00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:41.740
That's something that you don't think about on a day to day basis.

144
00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:44.200
They did a basis,
he just,
you know,

145
00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:47.200
just walk around and go to the mall and driving your car.

146
00:08:47.201 --> 00:08:47.930
You don't think about it.

147
00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:50.380
You're on a thousand miles an hour and a circle at all times.

148
00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:51.980
<v 3>Right.
And then on top of that,</v>

149
00:08:51.981 --> 00:08:56.460
the sun is revolving around the center of the galaxy even faster and our galaxy

150
00:08:56.461 --> 00:09:00.090
is going around the center of a supercluster even faster.
In fact,

151
00:09:00.091 --> 00:09:02.940
I think in the years,
Oh man,

152
00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:05.820
either in the year 1600 or 600 I don't remember.

153
00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:10.110
Earth was a light year away from where it is now relative to the center of the

154
00:09:10.111 --> 00:09:14.200
galaxy.
Holy Shit.
It's traveled a light year that gets a loan that,

155
00:09:14.201 --> 00:09:18.330
that amount of time.
It's either,
it's either,
I think it's 1400 years.

156
00:09:18.331 --> 00:09:21.360
That's how long it takes the earth to travel a light year just by spinning

157
00:09:21.361 --> 00:09:25.500
around with the son.
Where are we going around.

158
00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:30.300
Yeah.
And hundreds and hundreds of millions of years we'll be back.

159
00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:36.080
We'll be back in the same spot relative to the center of the galaxy.

160
00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:40.070
But the galaxy will have moved,
right.
There is no absolute reference frame.

161
00:09:40.071 --> 00:09:44.070
So the universe is expanding.
Yeah.
Yeah.

162
00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:47.730
<v 0>That's the other thing is there's maybe more than one universe.</v>

163
00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:51.830
<v 3>Yeah.
That could explain some of the,
the,
you know,</v>

164
00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:54.470
things we still don't know yet.

165
00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:58.580
There could be parallel universes where every other version of things happen.

166
00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:03.610
And that would explain things like why we happen to see the universe that we see

167
00:10:04.041 --> 00:10:07.100
now.
Why this one?
Um,

168
00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:09.770
yeah.

169
00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:11.420
<v 0>Yeah.
It's when,
you know,</v>

170
00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:15.050
it's almost kind of stoner talk because it's one of those things like,
man,

171
00:10:15.051 --> 00:10:16.820
try to wrap your head around that,
man.

172
00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:20.420
But it is a fascinating concept that,

173
00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:24.570
that we are in this essentially infinite universe.
I mean,

174
00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:29.240
they've tried to put dimensions on the universe itself.
Like there's a,

175
00:10:29.241 --> 00:10:32.480
there's an actual beginning and end to the university itself,

176
00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:37.130
but the infinity comes from the concept that inside every black hole is

177
00:10:37.131 --> 00:10:41.680
potentially another universe that every galaxy has a supermassive black hole.

178
00:10:41.681 --> 00:10:45.560
It's one half of 1% of the mass of the entire galaxy.

179
00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:47.600
And that inside that black hole,

180
00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:51.080
it's very possible that there's a whole nother universe with hundreds of

181
00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:53.060
billions of galaxies,
each with black holes inside of them,

182
00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:55.460
each with new universes inside of them,

183
00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:59.300
and that this fractal thing goes on and on and on and on,

184
00:10:59.301 --> 00:11:01.130
and there's literally no end.

185
00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:05.670
<v 3>Yeah,
and I don't know about black holes,
but the universe itself,</v>

186
00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:08.880
we give it a dimension.
We give it like a circumference or diameter,

187
00:11:08.881 --> 00:11:10.440
but that's just the observable universe.

188
00:11:10.441 --> 00:11:15.441
We don't really know what's beyond what we can see and it could go on

189
00:11:15.631 --> 00:11:16.464
infinitely.

190
00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:21.210
It could also wrap back on itself and be sort of infinite and one way in one

191
00:11:21.211 --> 00:11:23.970
sense.
But actually,
you know,
if you go far enough out,

192
00:11:23.971 --> 00:11:25.830
you curve around like an ant on a globe,

193
00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:28.950
that ant can just keep walking forward forever.

194
00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:30.690
He'll eventually return to where he came from,

195
00:11:30.691 --> 00:11:32.880
but he's never going to reach a wall,
an edge.

196
00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:37.890
We think that's how our universe works.
Is it wrapping back around itself?

197
00:11:37.891 --> 00:11:40.470
Well,
probably not.

198
00:11:40.471 --> 00:11:44.520
We've been able to look really far away and we don't see any evidence of things

199
00:11:44.521 --> 00:11:48.120
converging as if it's curving.
Yeah.
Like we're,

200
00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:51.870
we're 3d creatures on this four d shape.

201
00:11:51.871 --> 00:11:53.740
That wraps back around on itself.

202
00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:59.230
<v 4>Yeah.
The idea of the,
the universe having a finite amount of distance.</v>

203
00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:04.720
It's confusing as hell because then what's outside of the universe?
Well,
nothing.

204
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:09.080
Nothing.
So if it's finite,
then like where,

205
00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:11.620
what's it sitting in?
Right,
exactly.

206
00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.140
That's it's hard to wrap your head around and,
yeah,

207
00:12:13.141 --> 00:12:17.500
and it does sound like stoner talk,
but it's also cosmology talk.
I mean,

208
00:12:17.501 --> 00:12:21.580
it's a real science.
Real Science is stoner talk.

209
00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:25.240
If you really get down to it.
Yeah.
If you ask enough questions,
it gets down to,

210
00:12:25.241 --> 00:12:26.890
dude,
you're blowing my mind.
It's like,
no,

211
00:12:26.891 --> 00:12:31.690
that really is just the way this pen stays on the table is incredible.

212
00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:33.100
Yeah.
The Earth is spinning.

213
00:12:33.101 --> 00:12:37.390
Atomic mass of the earth is pulling everything down towards it and the more mass

214
00:12:37.391 --> 00:12:41.290
it has,
the heavier it will be and the more it'll stick.
I'm like,
what?

215
00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:46.660
Yeah.
The subatomic level,
then things become magic.
Yeah.

216
00:12:46.661 --> 00:12:51.400
And it's so sad that we're never going to see an atom there are too small.

217
00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:55.780
Like they're smaller than the wavelength needed for us to like see them.

218
00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.510
So we're never going to just be able to look at one.

219
00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:03.580
I don't think it makes any sense to ask what color anatomy is there beyond
color?

220
00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:06.460
They're just too small for it.
Too Small for color?
Yeah.

221
00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:10.760
Is it too small for our perceptions of what color color is or no.
No,

222
00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:12.820
they really are too small to trap light.

223
00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:15.670
The way color works doesn't apply to Adams individually.

224
00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:18.560
So even if we built like a super cool machine that,

225
00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:23.110
that tried to be better than our eyes,
there's no color to see acting together.

226
00:13:23.111 --> 00:13:26.380
Adam's can have a color obviously.
Would it be clear

227
00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:33.590
if there's no color,
how would you observe it?
Like what would you see?

228
00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:36.830
Would you see like wonder woman's plane?
Uh,

229
00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:39.980
number one to one was playing was invisible.
It was invisible.
Yeah.
Yeah.

230
00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:42.020
Had a lot of windows just didn't make any sense.

231
00:13:42.021 --> 00:13:45.140
Like who the fuck is she drew flying around with wonder woman?

232
00:13:45.141 --> 00:13:48.510
Didn't have just like a fighter jet.
She looked really corny.
Yeah,
she had,

233
00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:53.120
she was like an economy.
Yeah.
Uh,
no,

234
00:13:53.121 --> 00:13:56.960
but that's the thing.
There is,
there's no answer.
We don't know.

235
00:13:57.030 --> 00:14:00.950
They're not that we don't know.
We just know that that doesn't apply.

236
00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:04.820
And if that's the case,
okay,
if we can't see Adam's,

237
00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:08.360
how do we know so much about subatomic particles?

238
00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:12.450
Like what are we seeing when we're observing?
Right,
right.

239
00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:17.450
I see.
You were seeing their effects.
For instance,
in the cloud chamber,

240
00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:21.610
we can see individual particles because they interact with,
uh,
uh,

241
00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:26.090
gas in the Chamber and cause trails and we can follow the trail and photograph

242
00:14:26.091 --> 00:14:27.380
it and study it and say,
wow,

243
00:14:27.381 --> 00:14:30.950
look how it moved because of it's a span or because of its,
you know,

244
00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:35.240
the mass that we were able to detect.
It was probably a electron or whatever.

245
00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:37.940
Right.
But we can't look at it and say,
Oh dude,

246
00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:42.260
that was the same electron that I saw yesterday.
You know?
But if that's the case,

247
00:14:42.261 --> 00:14:44.870
how do they understand what they're measuring?

248
00:14:44.871 --> 00:14:47.000
Things like particles in super position,

249
00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:52.040
which means a particle that it's moving and still at the same time.
How are they

250
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:55.070
<v 1>doing that?
Look,
this is beyond my purview.</v>

251
00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:57.020
<v 3>Clearly it's something that I'd love to learn more about,</v>

252
00:14:57.021 --> 00:14:59.150
but I think that it's not so much that we see.

253
00:14:59.151 --> 00:15:02.150
Both were just like the only way to explain the way it behaves is that it was

254
00:15:02.151 --> 00:15:04.910
doing both before we made the measurement.
Okay.

255
00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:09.530
<v 1>Do you think that they'll one day have more accurate measuring and they like,</v>

256
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:12.740
oh my God,
we were so wrong.
It's possible.
Yeah.
It's more than one thing.
Yeah.

257
00:15:12.741 --> 00:15:13.320
There's a famous,
yeah.

258
00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:17.310
<v 3>What about science being a graveyard of dead ideas,
right.
Yeah.
Thanks.</v>

259
00:15:17.311 --> 00:15:19.470
We were like,
oh,
obviously the earth is the center.

260
00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:21.570
It seems that way and then someone goes up.

261
00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:26.500
<v 1>Oh,
actually,
that does create a problem,
doesn't it,
with educators.</v>

262
00:15:26.501 --> 00:15:30.310
Because if someone's been basing their entire life and their career writing

263
00:15:30.311 --> 00:15:34.570
books,
teaching a certain principle that turns out to be completely and totally

264
00:15:34.571 --> 00:15:39.160
incorrect at one point in time when new understanding come about,
what,
you know,

265
00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:42.550
that that runs into human areas,

266
00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:46.020
ego and weirdness when it comes to a,

267
00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:50.980
what people are willing to,
uh,
to accept and not wanting to.
Sure.
But the point,

268
00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:51.340
right

269
00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:55.570
<v 3>is not the facts.
It's the procedure,</v>

270
00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:59.680
the scientific method,
you know,
thinking scientifically and always basing these,

271
00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:01.360
these,
um,
you know,

272
00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:06.010
theories on things that we can experimentally test.
Right?

273
00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:09.310
That's what matters.
And,
and if you can devise better and better tests,

274
00:16:09.311 --> 00:16:11.950
you can learn more and more and be more and more sure of theories.

275
00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:15.880
But you should always be more excited about conquering ignorance than just like

276
00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:20.230
holding onto the,
the fact that you particularly liked or made up.

277
00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:24.570
<v 1>Yeah.
Most certainly.
You certainly should be.
But,
uh,
it is,
uh,</v>

278
00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:29.460
it's gotta be a real pain in the ass if you've spent your entire career teaching

279
00:16:29.461 --> 00:16:32.850
something,
writing books on something.
And it turns out to be correct,

280
00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:34.860
but that sort of comes with the territory.
Right.

281
00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:36.320
<v 3>I know,
and I've,
I've,
I actually,</v>

282
00:16:36.321 --> 00:16:39.890
I really want to do an episode at some point on like crazy things that people

283
00:16:39.891 --> 00:16:43.370
believe that you would consider super smart.
Like Dh Lawrence,
the author,

284
00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:47.300
he totally believed that the moon created light and refused to be convinced

285
00:16:47.301 --> 00:16:51.590
otherwise.
Hmm.
Right,
right.
Uh,
not,

286
00:16:51.591 --> 00:16:53.930
not because he was insane,
but because it was just like

287
00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:57.660
we had an advanced science enough.
Right.
Right.

288
00:16:57.700 --> 00:17:00.980
His science education was not great enough for him to go,
oh,

289
00:17:00.981 --> 00:17:04.000
it's reflecting from the sun right there.

290
00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:06.800
I'm sure there's all kinds of things like that.
Like William Shakespeare,

291
00:17:06.801 --> 00:17:08.280
what did he know?
He didn't know anything about,
about

292
00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:11.550
<v 1>black holes.
Right,
right.
He knew less about black holes.</v>

293
00:17:11.551 --> 00:17:15.120
Then the dumbest person listening to this show right now,
you know?
Yeah.
Right.

294
00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:17.010
No kidding.
Yeah.
It's,

295
00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:21.000
it's really bizarre when you think about the fact that people had,

296
00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:26.030
not only do they have like just a rudimentary understanding of the earth and its

297
00:17:27.001 --> 00:17:29.160
position in the stars and the universe,

298
00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:32.220
but with that rudimentary information,

299
00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:35.640
they were able to circumnavigate the globe.
Yeah.

300
00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:39.930
They were able to use those sextants and those like look at the stars and

301
00:17:39.931 --> 00:17:44.931
measured distances and figure out where they were based on constellations and go

302
00:17:44.941 --> 00:17:48.270
on the ocean in a fucking wouldn't floaty thing.

303
00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:50.250
And just the wind

304
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:54.420
<v 0>take them around a different yeah.
Dirt patches for years.
Yeah.</v>

305
00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:55.820
Hundreds and thousands of,
yeah.

306
00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:59.570
<v 3>You mentioned landing on a place where no one had been before and you're just</v>

307
00:17:59.571 --> 00:18:01.370
like,
well,
I hope we packed enough food.

308
00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:06.270
<v 0>Do you ever listen to radio lab?
Oh yeah.
It's great.
Great.
It's great cast.</v>

309
00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:10.910
They amazing an amazing piece on the Galapagos island recently.
Um,

310
00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:14.230
and it's uh,
where Darwin sort of,
uh,

311
00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:17.600
landed and PR partially where he formed his,

312
00:18:17.601 --> 00:18:20.620
his theories about evolution and because it's such a,

313
00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:24.000
just incredibly rich with diversity in different kinds of life.

314
00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:27.180
But when they were talking about this really amazing,

315
00:18:27.181 --> 00:18:32.181
and this is how little we understand about life and life's changes,

316
00:18:34.231 --> 00:18:36.870
and they're,
they're seeing life changes right now.

317
00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:41.190
They're seeing like the evolution of this new,
uh,
finch.
There's some,

318
00:18:41.191 --> 00:18:45.360
some new bird is forming because there's a larger finch that's dying off and the

319
00:18:45.361 --> 00:18:48.960
medium finch and the smaller fish are breeding and they're creating this new

320
00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:49.820
finch and it's right.

321
00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:54.780
And it's just unbelievably fascinating to think that all this is our point of

322
00:18:54.781 --> 00:18:57.150
reference is,
you know,
a thousand,

323
00:18:57.151 --> 00:19:01.320
a couple thousand years of people writing shit down and it's in the Greenwich

324
00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:03.060
Spectrum of life on Earth.
It's not,

325
00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:07.950
<v 3>it's nothing.
I was thinking the other day about a recorded audio and how,
uh,</v>

326
00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:12.510
briefly earth and humanity have been able to record audio.
Yeah.
Uh,

327
00:19:12.511 --> 00:19:16.470
and that brings up questions like,
what did George Washington sound like?
Yeah.

328
00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:18.060
Right.
Did he have a British accent?

329
00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:19.081
<v 0>Well,</v>

330
00:19:19.081 --> 00:19:24.030
they say that British accents actually didn't evolve until much later,

331
00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:29.330
and that the people that were in England in fact had a different accent in like

332
00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:31.920
the 16 hundreds.
Yeah.
Then they have today.

333
00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:35.720
<v 3>Yeah,
that's true.
And I think,
you know,
you find the right experts,</v>

334
00:19:35.721 --> 00:19:37.850
they can perform for you.

335
00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:42.930
These different accents not be not by,
uh,

336
00:19:42.931 --> 00:19:45.500
the fact that they've listened to recordings.
They have it,
there aren't any,

337
00:19:45.501 --> 00:19:49.100
but they can look at how words have changed over time and they can look at how

338
00:19:49.101 --> 00:19:52.830
spellings of changed over time and come to a pretty good,

339
00:19:52.831 --> 00:19:57.831
I see a pretty good conclusion about what a guy who lived in England in the year

340
00:19:58.641 --> 00:20:00.680
600 sounded like.

341
00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:05.740
<v 0>What's really trippy is when they go to dead languages.
Yeah.</v>

342
00:20:05.741 --> 00:20:09.460
And they tried to recreate the sound of like ancient Sumerian.

343
00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:11.680
<v 3>Oh Wow.
Yeah.
I hadn't thought of that.</v>

344
00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:12.041
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

345
00:20:12.041 --> 00:20:16.120
They're trying to figure out what it would sound like to hear like Gilgamesh

346
00:20:16.121 --> 00:20:17.830
talk,
right.
They,

347
00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:22.300
they have this sort of bizarre understanding.
I don't know.

348
00:20:22.301 --> 00:20:23.290
I don't really get it.

349
00:20:23.291 --> 00:20:26.620
I don't know how they could pull that out since nobody speaks it anymore.

350
00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:28.240
I don't know how they ever figured it out anyway.

351
00:20:28.241 --> 00:20:31.210
If you ever look at Cuny or form,
right.
I used to write back then,
right.

352
00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:36.040
A bunch of nails,
nails upwards and like old school nails,

353
00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:39.100
like I used to do construction when I lived in Boston.

354
00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:42.570
A lot of the buildings you would come across were really,
really old.
Yeah.

355
00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:44.770
Like they were from the 18 hundreds and they used to,

356
00:20:44.771 --> 00:20:47.200
the nails that they had back then were essentially handmade.

357
00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:50.980
They weren't the nails that we see today with like the circular top and the

358
00:20:50.981 --> 00:20:55.070
smooth,
uh,
the cylinder below at the smooth spike.

359
00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:59.020
They were like,
you know,
kind of ledges my wedges.

360
00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:02.800
And they were like crude and weird looking.
That's what cuneiform looks like,

361
00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:06.910
right?
A bunch of cute crude little wedges up and down and sideways.

362
00:21:06.911 --> 00:21:10.360
And they figured out how,
what that means,

363
00:21:10.361 --> 00:21:13.870
what they were saying essentially with debate,
you know,
of course.

364
00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:18.190
But they also are figuring out like what it sounded like when they were talking.

365
00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:23.590
That's weird.
I get the,
I get the translation thing.
Uh,
the,

366
00:21:23.591 --> 00:21:26.410
the Rosetta stone for instance,
really helped us go,
oh,

367
00:21:26.411 --> 00:21:29.830
thank goodness they wrote the same thing in three different languages and we

368
00:21:29.831 --> 00:21:33.390
know one of them or two of them.
Uh,
I don't know.
Um,

369
00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:38.500
I have a lot of respect for people that can do that.
Oh yeah.
Well,
it's also,

370
00:21:38.501 --> 00:21:42.970
it's gotta be maddening.
There's a national geographic,
I think it's,
yeah,

371
00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:46.900
probably pretty sure it's national geographic special called decoding the Maya.

372
00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:51.940
It's all about Mayan language and trying to understand how difficult that is.

373
00:21:51.941 --> 00:21:53.560
Another dead language essentially,

374
00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:57.430
but a dead language that's in hieroglyphic form.

375
00:21:57.730 --> 00:22:01.990
So images,
that means sounds,
you know,

376
00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:05.740
so like,
um,
Mckenna described it best.

377
00:22:05.741 --> 00:22:09.770
Like you would have like an eyeball assault,

378
00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:14.350
like the cuts would,
you'd have an aunt like the bug and the flower,

379
00:22:14.351 --> 00:22:18.040
like a rose.
And that's how you would say I saw aunt rose.

380
00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:23.950
Okay.
Yeah.
This clever.
Yeah.
But that's,
that's,
you know,

381
00:22:23.951 --> 00:22:28.330
that's how their language evolved.
Like our idea of,
I mean the,
is that,

382
00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:31.360
that would be ridiculous.
Like without fuck,
don't you have letters?

383
00:22:31.361 --> 00:22:34.750
Like can't you say Steve?
Where's Bob and Mike?

384
00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:37.090
But in their culture,
you know,

385
00:22:37.091 --> 00:22:41.470
that's what started and that's where it evolved and that's,
it grew out of that.

386
00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:43.990
And is that going to happen to English someday?

387
00:22:44.890 --> 00:22:47.470
I don't know what's going to happen with someday,
but I,
you know,

388
00:22:47.471 --> 00:22:50.500
me and my friends were sitting around the other day and we were talking about

389
00:22:50.501 --> 00:22:52.890
the idea of everything being on hard drives.
Yeah.

390
00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:58.020
And how bizarre that is that if anything happened and for whatever reason,

391
00:22:59.560 --> 00:22:59.981
you know,

392
00:22:59.981 --> 00:23:04.060
a good percentage of the population died and everybody that was left was

393
00:23:04.061 --> 00:23:05.050
computer illiterate.

394
00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:09.790
How long would it take before we lost everything that anybody ever figured out?

395
00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:10.781
I mean,

396
00:23:10.781 --> 00:23:15.781
there wouldn't be much left unless somehow or another genetically that

397
00:23:16.541 --> 00:23:21.430
information is stored or the revelations are somehow or another if there's a

398
00:23:21.431 --> 00:23:25.450
large enough segment of the population.
But if not,
that shit's gone.

399
00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:29.640
We have to leave instructions like here's how to play this blue ray.
Yeah.

400
00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:32.710
It contains information and history of earth.

401
00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:36.530
Well that's a thought that the people like Graham Hancock have when they stumble

402
00:23:36.531 --> 00:23:41.020
across these gigantic monolith that nobody can explain like bowel back in

403
00:23:41.021 --> 00:23:43.340
Lebanon and of course the,
this,

404
00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:46.580
the pyramids in Egypt and all these just bizarre,

405
00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:51.610
massive stone constructions that were not exactly sure how they put together.

406
00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:55.580
I mean,
still to this day,
they look at the great pyramid and they just go,
well,

407
00:23:55.610 --> 00:23:58.380
they may be,
we think that they kind of,

408
00:23:58.690 --> 00:24:02.950
<v 3>maybe the,
I dunno,
and they were made so long ago.
Yeah.
They weren't,</v>

409
00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:07.690
they're not like ancient Roman style.
Uh,
oldness it's way older than that.

410
00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:09.820
I did,
I did a video on,
uh,

411
00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:14.020
putting history in perspective and I've mentioned that the ancient Egyptian

412
00:24:14.021 --> 00:24:18.850
pyramids were as old to the ancient Romans as the ancient Romans are to us.

413
00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:21.673
There were,

414
00:24:21.910 --> 00:24:26.080
there were wooly mammoths still alive when the pyramids were built in Egypt.

415
00:24:26.081 --> 00:24:31.030
Oh yeah.
Was that true?
That's true.
Yeah.
On Wrangel island.
Yeah.
Well,

416
00:24:31.031 --> 00:24:34.540
I thought woolly mammoth died out 10,000 years ago.
I don't,

417
00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:37.540
I don't know when they died out or how,
we know

418
00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:39.900
<v 0>they died out of the pleistocene.
Right.
Didn't they?</v>

419
00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:43.560
I think woolly mammoths were a part of the great extinction event that they

420
00:24:43.561 --> 00:24:47.730
think is connected to a asteroidal impacts.
Least some people do.

421
00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:48.870
That's one of the theories.

422
00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:51.940
<v 3>Interesting.
Yeah.
Yeah.
All he knows that they were contemporaries,</v>

423
00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:53.290
the pyramids and woolly mammoths.

424
00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:57.610
And I can't tell you the exact date that these all happen.

425
00:24:58.670 --> 00:24:59.570
<v 0>That's amazing.</v>

426
00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:04.370
You know what's even more trippy is these new discoveries like this go Beckley

427
00:25:04.371 --> 00:25:09.371
TAPI thing that they're finding 12,000 plus years ago that they thought people

428
00:25:09.381 --> 00:25:12.020
back then were just hunter and gatherers and they're finding these gigantic

429
00:25:12.021 --> 00:25:17.021
carved stone columns with three d images of animals that are carved into it.

430
00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:20.390
Meaning like you have a large stone and you cut the stone down,

431
00:25:20.391 --> 00:25:25.270
but leave right off of a piece of stone that you could carve in a lizard.
Wow.

432
00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:27.950
It's super complicated work.
And that the,

433
00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:32.330
a lot of these lizards and animals aren't even native to the continent.

434
00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:34.790
Turkey is,
you know,

435
00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:39.530
we don't even think that these animals existed in the spot where this was going

436
00:25:39.531 --> 00:25:42.980
on.
And at least the current knowledges that we don't think they existed there.

437
00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:43.791
It's very,

438
00:25:43.791 --> 00:25:46.940
very strange because they thought people were just hunter gatherers back then

439
00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:49.280
and they built these massive,

440
00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:54.610
like a concentric circles with 19 foot high stone columns.

441
00:25:54.890 --> 00:25:57.650
Like they don't even know how to fuck they did it or who did it or what the

442
00:25:57.651 --> 00:25:58.431
culture was,

443
00:25:58.431 --> 00:26:02.810
and it's all new stuff over the last couple of decades found these and they're

444
00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:06.620
older to have to the ancient Egyptians.

445
00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:09.770
Then the ancient Egyptians are to us.
Wow.
Yeah.

446
00:26:09.771 --> 00:26:14.450
By almost seven years,
seven,
7,000 years,

447
00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:19.610
because they're 12,000 so the ancient Egyptians,
that's 2,500 BC,

448
00:26:19.611 --> 00:26:23.840
they think they built the pyramids.
So these guys are 12,000 plus.

449
00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:26.330
That's incredible.
Yeah.
It's not just incredible,

450
00:26:26.331 --> 00:26:30.560
but they don't even know really how old it is.
They just know 12,000 years ago,

451
00:26:30.561 --> 00:26:32.360
someone intentionally covered it up.

452
00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:38.110
They've done like carbon dating on the soil and the soil is uniform like that.

453
00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:41.630
The date of the soil is uniform,
which indicates to them,

454
00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:44.020
I think this is how they do it,
that the

455
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:46.770
<v 1>someone intentionally covered up this area.</v>

456
00:26:47.130 --> 00:26:50.220
<v 4>Maybe like someone conquered these fucking chairs that were building these</v>

457
00:26:50.221 --> 00:26:52.320
awesome things.
Like these guys are assholes.

458
00:26:52.321 --> 00:26:54.930
We need to go back to tents and cover all this crazy shit up.

459
00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:58.950
So they filled it all in 12,000 years ago.

460
00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:04.020
12,000 but humans have been around hundreds of thousands of million.
I mean,

461
00:27:04.021 --> 00:27:08.700
yeah.
It's like I'll never meet those people.
Yeah.

462
00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:11.880
Well,
and it's also the,
the,
the,
just that number,

463
00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:16.080
it's like just saying a thousand years,
this is like,
you put,

464
00:27:16.081 --> 00:27:20.790
try to put that in your head,
you're like,
okay.
But if you could see it

465
00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:23.300
<v 1>a thousand years and a timelapse,</v>

466
00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:27.860
if he could see it run through a timelapse and then see like seven of those in a

467
00:27:27.861 --> 00:27:32.300
row and then see like go Beckley tappy which is seven twice,
you know,

468
00:27:32.301 --> 00:27:36.560
and just like just run through how much change must've taken place on this

469
00:27:36.561 --> 00:27:41.540
planet and just one with his one bizarre life form that alters its environment.

470
00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:45.500
Right.
The only one in,
in,
you know,
in such a grand scale.

471
00:27:46.730 --> 00:27:46.941
Yeah.

472
00:27:46.941 --> 00:27:51.170
It's crazy trying to decipher that those people like archeologists trying to

473
00:27:51.171 --> 00:27:54.800
piece the past together.
That has got to be one of the most fastest.

474
00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:57.240
<v 4>Oh,
I know jobs ever.
Yeah,
I did.</v>

475
00:27:57.270 --> 00:28:01.710
I was reading about some of the oldest stuff we found is all about burial and

476
00:28:01.711 --> 00:28:04.500
death,
but we haven't found so many,
just like homes,

477
00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:09.000
like people's day to day lives weren't made to be nearly as permanent.

478
00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:13.710
Death was so much more important than where you spent your entire life.

479
00:28:14.590 --> 00:28:16.240
<v 1>Yeah.
Especially when they didn't really,
I mean,</v>

480
00:28:16.241 --> 00:28:18.730
not that we understand what happens when people die today.

481
00:28:18.731 --> 00:28:22.510
We just know they definitely die,
but we,
you know,
we don't,
we're still,

482
00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:26.590
it's a lot of guesswork about what the process is of shutting off the soul.

483
00:28:26.591 --> 00:28:27.670
If there is a soul,

484
00:28:27.671 --> 00:28:31.720
whatever that life spark is that the consciousness where it goes,

485
00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:34.350
does it go to the same place it goes when you're dreaming,
you know,
like what,

486
00:28:34.351 --> 00:28:37.120
what,
what exactly happens.
But back then,

487
00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:40.630
50% mortality rate for children if you're lucky,
you know,

488
00:28:40.631 --> 00:28:42.820
everybody's getting eaten by animals and like,

489
00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:47.600
<v 4>yeah.
Yeah.
I think I was reading in a Jared diamond's book,
um,</v>

490
00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:53.370
that germs and steel guns,
germs and know is newer one he was talking or or way,

491
00:28:53.371 --> 00:28:58.190
was that right?
Shoot?
I think so.
Yeah.
Anyway,

492
00:28:58.330 --> 00:29:00.230
I was talking about how there are,

493
00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:03.230
there are tribes that don't believe you're actually human until you're much

494
00:29:03.231 --> 00:29:07.580
older than a baby.
Like babies are just kind of like almost have souls,

495
00:29:07.581 --> 00:29:11.280
but not yet.
So if a baby dies,
it's like,
man,
wow.
Yeah,

496
00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:12.530
it hasn't been initiated yet.

497
00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:15.470
Or if you have too many kids you can just kill him cause they're there.

498
00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:20.120
They're just like
not like a mirror.
Cats do.

499
00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:23.720
Yeah,
maybe.
Right.
You just sit there and go,
wow,

500
00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:26.780
there's a lot of diversity of,
of everything on earth.

501
00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:29.830
Life and ideas will certainly,
yeah,
we

502
00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:32.550
<v 1>will.
We're,
we're big copycats.
You know,</v>

503
00:29:32.551 --> 00:29:37.080
we sort of imitate whatever the hell is going on around us if we have this idea

504
00:29:37.081 --> 00:29:38.910
that babies aren't alive yet.

505
00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.980
When you look at the horrible things that people were able justify doing

506
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:45.340
<v 0>to others,
just because those others are,
you know,</v>

507
00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:50.240
thought to be an enemy or a subhuman because they're the enemy.
Yeah.

508
00:29:50.970 --> 00:29:54.890
Yeah.
We're bizarre.
And is it this?
And it's,

509
00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:59.560
it's when you really stop and think about what this bizarre behavior,

510
00:29:59.561 --> 00:30:04.561
these bizarre behavior patterns people have and what they create like that they

511
00:30:04.811 --> 00:30:08.050
create these cultures that vary wildly,

512
00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:11.440
all human beings all on this planet.
But you know,

513
00:30:11.441 --> 00:30:14.290
look at the difference between Palestine and Chicago.

514
00:30:14.291 --> 00:30:18.310
Look at the difference between,
you know,
fill in the blank in Liberia,

515
00:30:18.311 --> 00:30:22.660
in San Francisco,
look at the difference between London and,
you know,
Mongolia,

516
00:30:22.661 --> 00:30:27.661
it's very strange how much things are different and how much they change.

517
00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:30.070
But yet everyone's just a person.

518
00:30:30.071 --> 00:30:33.100
Everyone can interbreed everyone can exchange ideas.

519
00:30:33.101 --> 00:30:36.670
And once you take someone from that culture and bring them into yours,

520
00:30:36.671 --> 00:30:41.500
they adopt those ideas.
If you took a baby from Nigeria,
brought them into,

521
00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:46.330
you know,
whatever,
Atlanta and raised him there,
talk to them.

522
00:30:46.331 --> 00:30:48.850
20 years later,
he's going to have an Atlanta accent.

523
00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:51.880
He's going to have all the cops.
He's probably going to be into,
you know,

524
00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:56.050
all the things that young kids are into and video games and young kids are into

525
00:30:56.051 --> 00:30:56.884
wearing the clothes.
I mean,

526
00:30:57.010 --> 00:31:01.600
he will look essentially entirely like an American kid.
Yeah,

527
00:31:01.910 --> 00:31:05.720
<v 3>yeah.
But humans aren't nearly as diverse as like dogs.
Right?</v>

528
00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:10.430
Dogs can come in huge,
have a huge variety of sizes and shapes and colors.

529
00:31:10.850 --> 00:31:14.180
Uh,
and they can all interbreed it's all the same species,

530
00:31:14.390 --> 00:31:16.520
but humans are pretty much all,
you know,

531
00:31:16.550 --> 00:31:21.530
we fall within this general distribution.
Is that true though?
I,
I dunno.
Is it,

532
00:31:21.531 --> 00:31:24.910
see,
I,
I want to make it clear that I have way more questions than answers.
Right.

533
00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:28.160
I asked the questions and then try to find answers.
I don't know.

534
00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:30.680
I could be wrong.
It could be like,
well,
Michael,
you know,

535
00:31:30.681 --> 00:31:34.190
we all just think humans are all pretty similar because we know them so well.

536
00:31:34.191 --> 00:31:35.030
Are we are them,

537
00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:36.670
<v 0>well,
a female dwarf,</v>

538
00:31:36.730 --> 00:31:40.570
a white female dwarf and Shaquille O'neal could have a baby.

539
00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:44.520
How is that any different than then a chihuahua and a great Dane?

540
00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:48.460
It's kind of similar,
the same difference.
It's kind of similar in a lot of ways.

541
00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:53.710
There's so different looking Shaquille O'Neal and a,
a female dwarf.
Yeah,

542
00:31:53.770 --> 00:31:57.130
they're very,
I mean,
assuming that the parts could fit right.

543
00:31:57.131 --> 00:32:00.070
I mean that's about as far up.
I mean,

544
00:32:00.071 --> 00:32:02.110
if you saw those two things and you'd be like,
oh,

545
00:32:02.111 --> 00:32:04.990
those are totally different things.
Do you think he would?
I think so.

546
00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:08.320
Totally different animals.
Yeah.
Well I like different specie.

547
00:32:08.321 --> 00:32:12.610
Here's a perfect example.
An Eagle can't fuck a pigeon and have a baby.

548
00:32:13.510 --> 00:32:15.400
You know what I'm saying?
Right.

549
00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:20.640
So Shaquille O'Neal and a female dwarf is a lot like an eagle and a pigeon.

550
00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:22.773
Uh Huh.

551
00:32:23.650 --> 00:32:26.890
I think we're going to have to do some experiments with the eagles and pigeons,

552
00:32:26.891 --> 00:32:29.620
I hope.
Oh,
okay.
That's what I meant.
I meant the Eagle.

553
00:32:30.130 --> 00:32:31.720
That's exactly what I meant.
Well,
you know,

554
00:32:31.721 --> 00:32:36.130
that's the argument that the ancient alien guys use to the point to the fact

555
00:32:36.131 --> 00:32:39.830
that human beings are genetically engineered because dogs were genetically

556
00:32:39.831 --> 00:32:40.100
engineer

557
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:41.310
<v 4>humans.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

558
00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:46.250
So their idea is that this is the proof that humans have been engineered and

559
00:32:46.251 --> 00:32:49.130
that there's many versions of us and that,
you know,

560
00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:53.480
there's been a bunch of different models that a crazy created and that's why we

561
00:32:53.481 --> 00:32:57.710
vary so widely as opposed to every other animal that can breed.

562
00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:03.040
Because hybrids in other species are usually sterile.

563
00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:05.780
But hybrids with human beings,

564
00:33:05.781 --> 00:33:08.960
like if you took Shaquille O'Neal and a white dwarf,

565
00:33:08.961 --> 00:33:12.020
you would assume that's a hybrid,
you know,
you assume but they're not,

566
00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:16.010
they're not.
It's the same race.
They totally like,

567
00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:19.430
they're totally compatible as far as the way that you breed with them.
Right,

568
00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:22.340
right.
Uh,
I,

569
00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:26.270
I am being distracted by how much I have to urinate.
Oh,

570
00:33:26.271 --> 00:33:31.070
go other day I was thinking about as just started man.
I know,

571
00:33:31.071 --> 00:33:34.670
but I was not prepared.
I had water,
I drank a whole one of these.
Good.

572
00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:36.230
And then I had hydrated stay healthy.

573
00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:40.400
And I had a bunch of coffee this morning too.
But uh,
I was thinking yesterday,

574
00:33:40.401 --> 00:33:44.390
this is related.
How much would you weigh if you never went to the bathroom?

575
00:33:45.650 --> 00:33:49.240
You'd be dead.
How quickly?
It wouldn't take long.
I mean,

576
00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:54.050
what if we had evolved to just not ever have to like a baby after just a month

577
00:33:54.051 --> 00:33:58.760
would be bigger than the biggest human ever.
Don't think I need to do the math.

578
00:33:59.090 --> 00:34:01.940
Well,
it depends on what you need to consume.
Like,

579
00:34:01.941 --> 00:34:05.900
if your body was so efficient that you no longer needed to urinate,

580
00:34:05.901 --> 00:34:09.560
like we kind of assume that your body would need to urinate,
but why?

581
00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:12.180
If your body needs water to stay alive,
like what,

582
00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:14.600
why are we assuming that it has to pull,

583
00:34:14.601 --> 00:34:18.230
it has to get rid of waste that it doesn't want anymore.
Well why could,

584
00:34:18.231 --> 00:34:20.900
could we just turn that into more hair instead?

585
00:34:21.110 --> 00:34:23.180
But why does it have to get rid of waste?

586
00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:27.170
Like isn't it possible that we can become so efficient that we no longer need to

587
00:34:27.171 --> 00:34:31.850
get rid of waste and we can just sort of exist by breathing?
Right,
right.

588
00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:34.690
Completely.
Just like self.
Yeah.

589
00:34:34.770 --> 00:34:39.350
I mean to get to a certain size and once we get to a certain size,

590
00:34:39.470 --> 00:34:40.760
we just,
you know,

591
00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:45.440
whatever you evaporate off by walking around like that you have to take back in.

592
00:34:45.590 --> 00:34:48.770
Right.
I guess,
you know.
Yeah.
Cause like they have,
you know,

593
00:34:48.771 --> 00:34:52.910
robots that that just dissipate heat.
They don't have her make a waste product.

594
00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:55.970
Your laptop doesn't create as much waste as a human,

595
00:34:55.971 --> 00:34:59.900
but it's also not nearly as complex.
Uh,

596
00:35:00.290 --> 00:35:01.940
but in some ways it's more complex.

597
00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:05.360
They've been able to make machines that can poop.

598
00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:09.770
You put food in and then it's got bacteria in different pumps and reservoirs

599
00:35:09.771 --> 00:35:14.771
inside and it creates something that resembles completely and smells just like a

600
00:35:15.261 --> 00:35:17.220
human dump.
Whoa.

601
00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:21.440
The first one I saw was done as a piece of art as art work.

602
00:35:21.441 --> 00:35:26.310
Like an artist created this machine that could poop just like a human.
And uh,

603
00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:28.640
now they do it as they call it a robo gut.

604
00:35:28.650 --> 00:35:31.760
It's actually a medical thing because when people have GI problems,

605
00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:36.500
a poop transplant is commonly used to reintroduce the healthy bacteria and

606
00:35:36.650 --> 00:35:39.750
taking from someone else and giving it to the sick person,
shoving it up.

607
00:35:39.751 --> 00:35:44.250
There is kind of like,
you know,
there's a lot of possibilities for rejection,

608
00:35:44.251 --> 00:35:45.690
infection,
stuff like that,
I guess.

609
00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:49.620
But the Robo Gut can make just perfectly clean poop just with the kind that you

610
00:35:49.621 --> 00:35:51.090
want.
Whoa.
Yeah.

611
00:35:51.550 --> 00:35:54.990
You get some artificial poop put up inside of you to fix any imbalances that you

612
00:35:54.991 --> 00:35:59.330
have in your gut flora that's fast and that crazy.

613
00:35:59.331 --> 00:36:03.480
You can have like a poop farm of robot intestine,
right.
That are just,

614
00:36:03.481 --> 00:36:08.040
and what do you feed them?
Yeah.
Digitally do burger runs for the robot guts.

615
00:36:08.041 --> 00:36:11.790
And they totally are.
It's gotta be totally organic.
It's got a probably,

616
00:36:11.791 --> 00:36:16.080
it's probably just like a paste or a liquid be like baby food.

617
00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:18.810
You wouldn't have to taste good.
The robot's not going to complain.
Yeah.

618
00:36:18.811 --> 00:36:23.460
Fuck that robot.
Just eat it,
bitch.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
So,

619
00:36:23.461 --> 00:36:26.550
so this is making them go to the bathroom.
Oh,
go urinate.

620
00:36:26.810 --> 00:36:29.660
<v 1>There's a million subjects,
so don't worry about it.
You come back,</v>

621
00:36:29.661 --> 00:36:33.530
we'll have many,
many things talk about and uh,
congratulations.

622
00:36:33.531 --> 00:36:37.910
You won the award for the quickest guy to p almost everybody.
Yeah.

623
00:36:37.911 --> 00:36:39.020
It's right there on the right hand side.

624
00:36:39.350 --> 00:36:44.130
Almost everybody has a point in time where,
uh,
the,
they,
they go,
oh,

625
00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:47.960
this is,
how long has this podcast go?
Um,
I got you see that look on their face.

626
00:36:47.961 --> 00:36:50.030
Like,
oh,
I think I have to pee.

627
00:36:51.410 --> 00:36:55.910
But this dude he made Michael made it to 50 minutes.

628
00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:59.990
That's not a lot of time,
but hey,
you gotta do what you gotta do.
I understand.

629
00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:05.060
Yeah,
she is that his girlfriend?
Maybe ex girl.
Oh my God.

630
00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:06.920
That's hilarious.

631
00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:09.980
She's like five feet tall I think is that is why I think that's his ex wife

632
00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:14.780
actually,
which is incredible that he was seven foot.

633
00:37:14.781 --> 00:37:18.410
What?
How tall is it?
Seven one seven one 50 easily,
dude.

634
00:37:18.411 --> 00:37:23.060
I did fear factor with him and uh,
I stand about penis high with him.

635
00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:26.900
And uh,
when we were doing it,
it was like I was with my dad.

636
00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:31.430
It was like I was with my giant black dad and he was standing next to me.

637
00:37:31.431 --> 00:37:32.264
He did the countdown.

638
00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:36.030
<v 4>Oh,</v>

639
00:37:36.210 --> 00:37:39.530
<v 1>it was fear effective for you or for you?</v>

640
00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:45.200
That's a big dude.
This guy,
Michael Stevens,
uh,

641
00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:49.800
if you have never heard of him and a,
I are interested in this conversation,

642
00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:54.990
his youtube page is fucking amazing.
It's really cool.
And a,

643
00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:58.890
it's called tweet sauce or vsauce rather tweet sauce is his,
um,

644
00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:02.040
his Twitter page and he's back.
I'm,

645
00:38:02.350 --> 00:38:04.380
I'm s I'm thinking he's going to have to pick one more.

646
00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:07.340
<v 4>You think so?
I think I'm going to be fine.
I basically,</v>

647
00:38:07.341 --> 00:38:11.300
when I heard that you couldn't just cut it out like my pee break,

648
00:38:11.301 --> 00:38:13.550
I got really nervous and I all of a sudden had to pee.

649
00:38:15.170 --> 00:38:18.800
And to be fair there was a,
it was a very voluminous urination.
Like it wasn't um,

650
00:38:18.801 --> 00:38:20.420
a nervous one.
It was a real one.

651
00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:24.440
You might be the first guy I've ever heard use volume illness when it comes to

652
00:38:24.441 --> 00:38:29.390
urination.
Oh I use it all the time.
Every time.
No,
no,
I do get concerned.
I'm like,

653
00:38:29.391 --> 00:38:31.940
am I peanut enough?
Cause I've said I've,
I've peed um,

654
00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:36.010
next to other guys like you know,
in different urinals.

655
00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:36.760
<v 3>Right.</v>

656
00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:41.290
And I can tell that like they're going a lot longer than me and the sound that

657
00:38:41.291 --> 00:38:41.741
it's making,

658
00:38:41.741 --> 00:38:46.720
it's just so much like the flow is so strong and it must contain so many gallons

659
00:38:46.721 --> 00:38:50.140
of,
and I'm like,
do you just hold it longer?
Is your bladder bigger than mine?

660
00:38:50.141 --> 00:38:54.940
I'm very insecure about how much Ip I feel like it's not impressive.

661
00:38:55.130 --> 00:38:57.110
<v 1>Depends on where you are.
If you're at a bar,</v>

662
00:38:57.140 --> 00:38:59.840
those guys are probably drinking beer.
And if you're drinking beer,

663
00:38:59.841 --> 00:39:02.280
you're going to pee massive oddity,
right?

664
00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:06.110
It's coming out hard and you probably having a conversation with somebody and

665
00:39:06.111 --> 00:39:08.570
you're holding it in for a while and then when you do let it go,

666
00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:13.580
<v 3>yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Waterfall.
Yeah,
that could be a while.
I was peeing.</v>

667
00:39:13.581 --> 00:39:18.060
I did think of something that kind of wraps up the whole first part of this pre

668
00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:23.030
p conversation and again goes back to Jared diamond who said,
uh,

669
00:39:23.031 --> 00:39:27.410
he tells a story about,
um,
Europeans first meeting a tribe in Papa New Guinea.

670
00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:31.730
And of course if you're this tribe and these guys show up using technology and

671
00:39:31.731 --> 00:39:34.820
materials you'd never seen before and they look very different and they dress

672
00:39:34.821 --> 00:39:37.520
very different,
you might think that they're gods,

673
00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:39.790
that there are different types of animal.
Um,

674
00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:43.610
and I think they thought they were gods until two things happened.
One,

675
00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:48.170
the tribe realized that the Europeans pooped and it smelled just like theirs.

676
00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:50.990
And secondly,
they could have sex.

677
00:39:51.290 --> 00:39:56.120
Those two things solidified the fact that they were all humans together.

678
00:39:56.390 --> 00:39:59.660
Wow.
Yeah.
They had different types of weapons.

679
00:39:59.661 --> 00:40:01.490
They had a different way of speaking and dressing,

680
00:40:01.491 --> 00:40:04.820
but there were things about them.
Those two things that really made,

681
00:40:04.910 --> 00:40:09.590
made both sides realize we are the same animal.
Wow.

682
00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:10.600
Yeah.

683
00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:14.420
<v 1>Can you imagine being someone who lives in some sort of a tribal environment in</v>

684
00:40:14.421 --> 00:40:18.140
the middle of the Amazon and all of a sudden a plane lands,
you know,

685
00:40:18.141 --> 00:40:22.640
on the water and people come out and you're like,
what the fuck is this?

686
00:40:22.641 --> 00:40:24.230
No one's ever seen another PR,

687
00:40:24.270 --> 00:40:28.250
especially a white person that has gotta be akin to an alien.

688
00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:30.780
<v 3>Oh,
it is.
It is.
And it's,</v>

689
00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:35.760
it's a kinda been visited by a god as well.
So look up the cargo cults.

690
00:40:36.810 --> 00:40:40.170
I don't remember what part of the world they live in,
but,
uh,
during,

691
00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:41.520
I think during a war,

692
00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:45.150
airplanes were coming in and out and these tribal people didn't know what they

693
00:40:45.151 --> 00:40:45.990
were.
They,
they,

694
00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:49.280
we still don't exactly know what they're thinking or what they were.
But,
uh,

695
00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:52.080
the plane stopped after a while.
The war was over.

696
00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:55.620
And to this day they have recreated,
I'm serious.

697
00:40:55.621 --> 00:41:00.390
They've recreated using materials that they find around where they live a runway

698
00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:02.640
and all the things that they associate with,

699
00:41:02.650 --> 00:41:06.300
whether they built a little airplane out a wood trying to get it to come back.

700
00:41:06.330 --> 00:41:08.680
Yeah.
Yeah.
Von Daniken.

701
00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:13.430
<v 1>Use that as an argument in chariots of the Gods and explain that,
uh,</v>

702
00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:15.910
this is one of the reasons why,
you know,

703
00:41:15.911 --> 00:41:20.911
these depictions of what could be interpreted as flying saucers and all these

704
00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:25.390
shares and modern art.
That's,
that's what it is.

705
00:41:25.391 --> 00:41:30.391
It's like the long lost information passed down generation to generation of,

706
00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:32.090
at one point in time we were,

707
00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:35.630
were visited by something from somewhere else and it sounds that's a,

708
00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:39.530
one of those subjects where as soon as you open up the possibility of that,

709
00:41:39.531 --> 00:41:43.340
you say like,
well we,
maybe we were visited,
but you like,
oh,
just fucking Christ.

710
00:41:43.341 --> 00:41:47.150
He's one of those guys.
Like it's an immediate reaction.
I have it.

711
00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:51.650
It's like when someone starts talking to me about the possibility of humans

712
00:41:51.651 --> 00:41:55.670
being visited,
extra terrestrials coming here,
right.
Manipulating our DNA.

713
00:41:55.671 --> 00:41:57.600
And we were okay.
All right,
I got you.

714
00:41:57.810 --> 00:41:58.770
<v 3>That's,
that's fine.</v>

715
00:41:58.771 --> 00:42:02.730
But I would like for them to show me experiments they've devised that'll give us

716
00:42:02.731 --> 00:42:06.540
evidence for that.
Otherwise,
it's not falsifiable.
Right.
I could say,
dude,

717
00:42:06.570 --> 00:42:10.470
you know that there's a blue rhinoceros on some planet that's billions of years

718
00:42:10.471 --> 00:42:15.240
away.
Seriously?
Well,
there might be,
yeah,

719
00:42:15.241 --> 00:42:19.710
there might be.
There might be aliens might have created the pyramids,
right?

720
00:42:20.250 --> 00:42:24.390
Probably not though.
Well,
they don't,
I don't,
I

721
00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:29.090
<v 1>think there's anyone credible that thinks that aliens created the pyramids.
Um,</v>

722
00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:33.910
but would they do think is that they created people and that they did some sort

723
00:42:33.911 --> 00:42:37.600
of a genetic manipulation.
Right,
right.
Things.
And when I say credible,

724
00:42:37.601 --> 00:42:41.140
like credible,
I mean,
what does that mean?
You know,

725
00:42:41.170 --> 00:42:44.050
there's no evidence whatsoever.
None.
None.

726
00:42:44.620 --> 00:42:48.640
I did this show for something fun.
Fiction though.
That'd be an awesome movie.

727
00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:51.610
Well,
that's that the whole base of prometheus's yeah.

728
00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:54.940
That we were somehow or another engineer,
the engineer's came down right here.

729
00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:58.570
And that's,
uh,
you know,
when you talk about Sumerian texts,

730
00:42:58.571 --> 00:42:59.470
we were talking about that earlier.

731
00:42:59.471 --> 00:43:03.100
That was the whole premise of this guy's Zechariah.

732
00:43:03.210 --> 00:43:07.720
It's worth work.
They've ever heard of that guy.
It sounds very familiar.
Oh,

733
00:43:07.721 --> 00:43:11.530
he's the king of all those,
uh,
people who are into wacky shit.

734
00:43:11.830 --> 00:43:16.540
Zacharias Hitchens,
the king.
Okay.
Because he believed that the Sumerian text,

735
00:43:16.830 --> 00:43:19.580
um,
if you deciphered it correctly,

736
00:43:19.581 --> 00:43:24.190
approves that we were engineered by something called the Annunaki and that the

737
00:43:24.191 --> 00:43:28.720
Annunaki,
the literal translation of auto as those from heaven to earth came,

738
00:43:29.050 --> 00:43:33.370
meaning that it was,
uh,
the same as the Elohim from the Bible.
Right.
That,

739
00:43:33.490 --> 00:43:36.700
you know,
these,
these beings came from another planet,

740
00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:41.350
genetically altered human beings and he points to these various images that
were,

741
00:43:41.351 --> 00:43:42.100
um,

742
00:43:42.100 --> 00:43:47.100
in the Sumerian text and Sumerian cuneiforms and all these different stone

743
00:43:47.531 --> 00:43:52.390
carvings that show what looks like the double helix of DNA.
Um,

744
00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:54.160
uh,
sure,
sure.
The caduceus,
you know,

745
00:43:54.161 --> 00:43:56.710
the two snakes that are wrapped around the pole that we associate with medicine,

746
00:43:57.130 --> 00:43:59.580
that he interprets that as being,
uh,
an an,

747
00:44:00.370 --> 00:44:03.450
an image of the Double Helix Dna,
right?

748
00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:09.280
Coincidence too.
It could be,
yeah.
But it does look a lot like it.
Right.

749
00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:12.940
You know,
the double helix and the,
the two snakes wrapped around a pole,

750
00:44:13.210 --> 00:44:17.670
but the weirdness is the,
the pictures of like,
there's one that shows a,

751
00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:20.350
one of these,
uh,
auto knocky with a,

752
00:44:20.650 --> 00:44:25.650
looks like a person with a tail sitting on his lap and they interpret that as

753
00:44:25.691 --> 00:44:30.691
being like this idea that they took sub human primates and manipulated the DNA,

754
00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:33.810
adding alien DNA creating.

755
00:44:34.250 --> 00:44:38.070
It's just incredibly bizarre stuff.

756
00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:42.570
But what gets me is,
yeah,
absolutely ridiculous.
Yeah,

757
00:44:42.571 --> 00:44:44.280
probably not right.
Most people,

758
00:44:44.310 --> 00:44:48.560
and there's also a website called Cichon is wrong,
where other,
sure.

759
00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:53.110
Other scholars who have studied the cuneiform and studied the Sumerian texts

760
00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:55.080
completely disagree with his interpretations.

761
00:44:55.410 --> 00:45:00.410
But if we could travel to another planet and we could do it successfully,

762
00:45:00.721 --> 00:45:01.720
and we've done it,
you know,

763
00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:04.750
for thousands and thousands of years and southern planet is,
you know,

764
00:45:04.770 --> 00:45:09.090
whey the fuck and the other side of the galaxy and we find some primates.

765
00:45:10.110 --> 00:45:13.140
I don't think it's outside the realm of possibility that we would manipulate

766
00:45:13.141 --> 00:45:13.900
their DNA

767
00:45:13.900 --> 00:45:16.690
<v 3>there.
There are actually protocols already in place,</v>

768
00:45:16.870 --> 00:45:18.610
not officially adopted by any government,

769
00:45:18.611 --> 00:45:23.611
but protocols about what do we do if we discover life because we,

770
00:45:24.310 --> 00:45:29.050
uh,
most likely would contaminate it by trying to observe it.
I think that there,

771
00:45:29.051 --> 00:45:33.340
there are even people arguing right now that Mars has been contaminated by the

772
00:45:33.341 --> 00:45:37.600
rovers,
by the rovers that have gotten there.
I mean,
we,
we've found,

773
00:45:37.990 --> 00:45:41.160
I think staph bacteria,
uh,

774
00:45:41.350 --> 00:45:46.350
on the moon that had been sent to the moon when we visited because we didn't

775
00:45:47.441 --> 00:45:48.820
completely sterilize everything.

776
00:45:48.870 --> 00:45:51.990
<v 1>Thank you.
Someone touched,
excuse me,
someone touching the object.</v>

777
00:45:51.991 --> 00:45:53.400
The object went to the moon,
right?

778
00:45:53.401 --> 00:45:57.900
Someone observed that staff being on the object living on the,
wow.

779
00:45:57.970 --> 00:46:02.440
<v 3>It wasn't living on the moon,
but it was just,
it was transferred there.
Yeah.
Um,</v>

780
00:46:02.740 --> 00:46:05.740
and so that's a huge problem.
Um,

781
00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:11.030
<v 1>well just space junk itself.
Just the idea of the rover being on Mars.
I mean,</v>

782
00:46:11.210 --> 00:46:15.650
if another life form visited Mars landed there and found the rover,

783
00:46:15.651 --> 00:46:18.680
they'd be like,
okay,
what the fuck is that?

784
00:46:19.010 --> 00:46:19.640
<v 3>Right.</v>

785
00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:23.810
And this brings up the whole question of kind of space archaeology or like space

786
00:46:23.811 --> 00:46:27.260
preservation.
So the,
the,
um,

787
00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:30.470
the stuff Neil Armstrong used to like get to the moon and walk around,

788
00:46:30.471 --> 00:46:35.030
it's all still there.
Right?
So if we ever start regularly going to the moon,

789
00:46:35.031 --> 00:46:37.520
do we set up a museum there?
Do we put fences up around it?

790
00:46:37.521 --> 00:46:38.990
Who owns that landing site?

791
00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:42.750
<v 1>Well,
your name was supposed to fly over those sites.
Right.
And then didn't they,</v>

792
00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:44.050
the,

793
00:46:44.050 --> 00:46:49.050
they made some sort of a ruling that any future space flights should not take

794
00:46:50.551 --> 00:46:53.220
place over those sites.
I didn't hear about that.
Yeah.

795
00:46:53.550 --> 00:46:57.090
I think they're worried about people fucking it up,
you know?
I mean,
look,
if we,

796
00:46:57.091 --> 00:47:02.091
if space travel becomes like as easy as at one point in time,

797
00:47:02.131 --> 00:47:05.430
getting across the country was a fucking heroic event.
You know,

798
00:47:05.790 --> 00:47:10.560
when the pilgrims landed and you had the,
I was watching this show last night,

799
00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:12.360
that was,
um,

800
00:47:12.450 --> 00:47:17.450
it was all about the wagons that they used to traverse the land to get from the

801
00:47:18.991 --> 00:47:23.210
east coast to the west coast.
Yeah.
Amazing stuff.
Because,
you know,

802
00:47:23.220 --> 00:47:26.430
we have like leaf spin springs and certain cars,

803
00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:29.890
they had them that they had made out of leather,

804
00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:34.030
<v 0>like they had concocted these sort of suspension cells,</v>

805
00:47:34.330 --> 00:47:36.610
these adjustable manipulate,
you know,
the,

806
00:47:36.650 --> 00:47:40.390
so they would move a little bit as they went over rocks and stuff and they had

807
00:47:40.391 --> 00:47:42.910
done all this stuff out of leather and is,

808
00:47:42.911 --> 00:47:47.911
it's just so strange to think that there were people that had put their life in

809
00:47:48.731 --> 00:47:51.870
their faith and they had,
you know,
some goods in the back,

810
00:47:51.871 --> 00:47:55.210
they have some food and they were hoping to find things to eat along the way,

811
00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:59.830
but it's going to take you fucking forever.
Yeah.
Now you get an a plane.

812
00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:04.690
And then I got,
uh,
I got uh,
uh,
uh,
La Flight I got to catch.
Um,

813
00:48:04.810 --> 00:48:09.720
so,
uh,
I land at noon,
I'll call you.
Love you ma.
Can I kids see a,

814
00:48:09.730 --> 00:48:13.990
yeah.
Daddy will call you when he lands,
what?
You just get in a plane.

815
00:48:13.991 --> 00:48:18.700
I mean that 200 years ago,
insanely preposterous.
So different.

816
00:48:18.790 --> 00:48:22.840
The idea is one day,
200 years from now,
whatever it is,

817
00:48:22.990 --> 00:48:24.730
it'll be that easy to get to the moon.

818
00:48:24.731 --> 00:48:26.950
So they're putting these protocols in place like,
Hey,

819
00:48:26.951 --> 00:48:29.170
don't go there and just steal shit,

820
00:48:29.210 --> 00:48:33.590
<v 4>steal it or yeah,
take a rental home with you.
Right,
right.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

821
00:48:33.591 --> 00:48:35.380
Lucy Kay is a great joke about that.
He's like,

822
00:48:35.390 --> 00:48:37.490
you used to be to go across the United States.

823
00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:41.570
It took so many years that people died.
People were born.

824
00:48:41.690 --> 00:48:43.190
It was a whole different group of people.

825
00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:47.030
By the time you finally got your destination,
this,
this is the Louis C k joke,

826
00:48:47.031 --> 00:48:50.510
and now it's just like you get in a plane and you're done.

827
00:48:51.170 --> 00:48:55.310
<v 0>You know,
when Elon Musk finishes these crazy high speed rails,</v>

828
00:48:55.640 --> 00:48:57.230
then it's going to be like an hour.

829
00:48:57.380 --> 00:49:01.240
<v 4>Oh,
it's crazy.
An hour to get to New York from here,
just show,</v>

830
00:49:02.990 --> 00:49:07.990
just taking off on some crazy magnetic rail system and virgin galactic as well,

831
00:49:08.300 --> 00:49:12.740
right?
They,
they'll get into like the sub orbital,
um,

832
00:49:13.340 --> 00:49:17.450
uh,
I guess tracks and uh,

833
00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:21.830
you can go from here to Australia in just a matter of minutes.

834
00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:25.040
They orbit to in the International Space Station.

835
00:49:25.041 --> 00:49:28.340
They orbit around the earth 17 times a day.
God,

836
00:49:28.610 --> 00:49:31.160
so yeah,
so crazy.

837
00:49:31.190 --> 00:49:35.810
They have 17 sunrises and sunsets every 24 hour period.
Oh my God.

838
00:49:35.811 --> 00:49:39.260
That's amazing.
That is amazing.
That's booking it.

839
00:49:40.250 --> 00:49:44.810
<v 0>That is so crazy.
So it's so a little less than every two hours.</v>

840
00:49:45.190 --> 00:49:46.230
<v 4>Yeah,
yeah,</v>

841
00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:52.220
yeah.
Fucking a,

842
00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:56.310
<v 0>and that's just the beginning.
You know,
a thousand years from now,</v>

843
00:49:56.340 --> 00:50:00.150
if we stay alive and don't blow each other up,
it'll be even easier to do that.

844
00:50:00.310 --> 00:50:01.720
<v 4>Yeah.
And people will say,
man,</v>

845
00:50:01.721 --> 00:50:05.590
remember back when people used to orbit the earth only 17 times every 24 hours.

846
00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:08.410
This is another,
and I don't remember the comedian who told this joke,

847
00:50:08.411 --> 00:50:11.140
but he's like,
in the future,
like everything's gonna be so fast.

848
00:50:11.350 --> 00:50:15.430
It's going to take like two seconds to go everywhere.
But the DMV,
man,

849
00:50:15.431 --> 00:50:18.340
it's going to take nine seconds and we're all going to hate it.

850
00:50:19.660 --> 00:50:20.650
That's so true.

851
00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:25.690
<v 0>That is,
is going to be very strange.
I think it is very strange now when you,
you,</v>

852
00:50:25.691 --> 00:50:30.290
you know,
it used to be if someone showed up on your border,

853
00:50:30.770 --> 00:50:34.220
no matter where you were,
it was usually a fucking problem.
You know,

854
00:50:34.221 --> 00:50:39.221
if a boat pulled up like very rarely where people just super cool and you know,

855
00:50:39.291 --> 00:50:44.120
you're not worried about it.
But today there's a thing called tourism,

856
00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:49.160
right?
And it's a huge part of life.
I mean a huge part of life in,

857
00:50:49.161 --> 00:50:54.161
in various cultures is people showing up and bringing with them money and uh,

858
00:50:55.161 --> 00:50:59.570
they,
you know,
you welcome them part of the economy of the area,
right?

859
00:50:59.870 --> 00:51:04.870
It's very strange how just that ability to traverse distances has changed the

860
00:51:05.961 --> 00:51:07.580
way human beings interact with each other.

861
00:51:07.790 --> 00:51:12.790
And it's also made the idea of countries and nationalities and your loyalty to

862
00:51:13.731 --> 00:51:16.850
those countries and nationalities a little bit more ridiculous.

863
00:51:16.850 --> 00:51:19.130
Every year a little bit more ridiculous.

864
00:51:19.150 --> 00:51:24.150
The closer we get to this ability to instantaneously travel from one place to

865
00:51:25.161 --> 00:51:28.280
another,
like these borders,
he's selfimposed borders.

866
00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:32.450
Like the border between Mexico and the United States is probably one of the most

867
00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:35.620
egregious.
When you stop and think about the,
the,

868
00:51:35.690 --> 00:51:39.630
the difference in prosperity between like,
yeah,
you know,

869
00:51:39.650 --> 00:51:44.510
Juarez and Los Angeles,
Tijuana and San Diego.
It's like,
fuck man.

870
00:51:44.511 --> 00:51:48.110
Like that's crazy that a third world country is right there.

871
00:51:48.710 --> 00:51:52.700
These poor people are starving to death and we won't let them come across this

872
00:51:52.701 --> 00:51:56.540
little imaginary line where everything is wonderful and everybody's fat,

873
00:51:57.210 --> 00:52:02.080
<v 4>you know?
Yeah,
yeah.
Uh,
and people often say like,
aw,</v>

874
00:52:02.081 --> 00:52:05.260
but dude,
when you're like,
look down on the earth from outer space,

875
00:52:05.261 --> 00:52:06.430
you don't see borders,

876
00:52:06.550 --> 00:52:11.410
but you do the border between India and Pakistan is lit up so brightly.

877
00:52:11.590 --> 00:52:16.120
You can see it from space.
What is it like?
Is it like,
uh,
like their,

878
00:52:16.121 --> 00:52:20.290
their borders at like a fence?
Like he's like the Great Wall of China.
Yeah.

879
00:52:20.300 --> 00:52:24.100
Parts of it.
Parts of it are just,
I think,
yeah.
Fenced off,

880
00:52:24.190 --> 00:52:27.810
militarized lit up and,
uh,
I,

881
00:52:27.820 --> 00:52:31.820
I've covered a few other borders that you can see from space in the past.

882
00:52:31.850 --> 00:52:34.380
I'm not remembering them at the moment,
but it's like we've,

883
00:52:34.850 --> 00:52:37.810
you could look down from Earth and tell that we don't all get along.

884
00:52:38.140 --> 00:52:40.930
My friend Ari that you see behind you right there on the or above you,

885
00:52:41.260 --> 00:52:42.710
that photo.
Um,

886
00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:48.000
Ari just got back from doing a tour of China and I took some photos of himself

887
00:52:48.041 --> 00:52:50.920
on the Great Wall.
And,
uh,
I,
you know,

888
00:52:50.921 --> 00:52:53.710
I'd read that you could see the Great Wall from space.
Apparently I can't,

889
00:52:54.280 --> 00:52:57.050
but when he was,
uh,
there,
you know,

890
00:52:57.070 --> 00:53:00.100
we were talking about the Great Wall and he was saying how fucking crazy it was.

891
00:53:00.101 --> 00:53:05.101
So then I started looking up the Great Wall and it's 5,000 miles long.

892
00:53:06.881 --> 00:53:10.610
It's a great wall.
That's not a good wall.
Yeah.
I mean,

893
00:53:10.630 --> 00:53:14.570
that really is a great wall.
That's a funny joke by the way.
I would,
if there's a,

894
00:53:14.610 --> 00:53:19.330
uh,
a wall in China,
people call the good wall.
China.
It's all right.
I mean,

895
00:53:19.331 --> 00:53:23.320
it's,
it keeps the ceiling up.
It's pretty good.
Bar's been set.
So high,

896
00:53:23.500 --> 00:53:26.100
good wall would have to be a few thousand miles.
You know,

897
00:53:26.101 --> 00:53:29.070
the good wall would have to be like 2000 miles.
Right,
right.
You know,

898
00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:33.240
what is that picture,
Jamie?
He pulled up,
yeah,
Pakistan border.
Yeah.
Look at that.

899
00:53:34.170 --> 00:53:38.070
Wow.
About 2000 kilometers long.
It's insane,
right?
Yeah.

900
00:53:38.071 --> 00:53:41.130
You could see that border.
That's legit.
That's a line.

901
00:53:41.180 --> 00:53:45.030
It's a highway is what it is.
This is what it looks like from the ground.
Really?

902
00:53:45.270 --> 00:53:49.920
Wow.
How fascinating to people look similar live right next door.

903
00:53:50.010 --> 00:53:54.000
Hate each other,
have nuclear weapons pointing at each other at all times.
Yeah.

904
00:53:54.030 --> 00:53:55.940
My friend Shane Smith,
the,
uh,

905
00:53:56.100 --> 00:53:59.670
he runs vice.com he's been to Indian,
Pakistan,

906
00:53:59.671 --> 00:54:04.470
and he says that is the one place where he's most terrified of a nuclear war

907
00:54:04.471 --> 00:54:08.890
breaking out.
Oh,
for sure.
Osama bin Laden was in Pakistan.
It's,

908
00:54:08.940 --> 00:54:13.380
it's crazy.
You know,
I was just in Mumbai and at the airport,

909
00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:18.210
a plane came in and it was from Iran.
I on airlines and I'm like,
wow,

910
00:54:18.211 --> 00:54:21.510
you don't see that in America.
They're not allowed to land there.
But,

911
00:54:21.540 --> 00:54:24.450
but I actually went over,
just watched the people getting off the plane.

912
00:54:24.450 --> 00:54:28.830
I was like,
hey,
fellow humans that I would never run into unless this happened.

913
00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:34.000
Also the fact that,
um,
to go from,
I went from Washington DC to Mumbai,
uh,

914
00:54:34.230 --> 00:54:38.160
we flew over Iraq and Afghanistan and I'm like,
Whoa,

915
00:54:38.340 --> 00:54:42.240
I didn't know we did this.
And then after what happened in the Ukraine,
I'm like,

916
00:54:42.450 --> 00:54:44.040
that's crazy.

917
00:54:44.041 --> 00:54:48.810
I felt like I was safe up there at 30,000 feet flying over,
um,

918
00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:52.980
the earth,
but apparently not.
What exactly has happened?

919
00:54:53.190 --> 00:54:57.450
Are they sure that these were blown up by missiles and not by bombs?
I haven't,

920
00:54:57.810 --> 00:54:59.490
I haven't been following the story well enough.

921
00:54:59.491 --> 00:55:03.680
Last I heard it was fired from an antiaircraft,
um,

922
00:55:04.410 --> 00:55:08.070
weapon from the ground.
So I didn't know they could do that.

923
00:55:08.100 --> 00:55:11.340
I know 30,000 feet in the air.
I didn't know that he would hit that.

924
00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:13.290
And just a few weeks before that happened,

925
00:55:13.291 --> 00:55:17.840
I was reading some article I found on dig that was all about,
uh,
you know,

926
00:55:17.850 --> 00:55:21.120
airport security keeps us from bringing things on the planes,

927
00:55:21.390 --> 00:55:25.290
but the real ness next threat is what people can do to planes from the ground.

928
00:55:25.590 --> 00:55:26.820
And I was like,
no way.

929
00:55:27.030 --> 00:55:29.760
But then if you're going to be in and out burger that's near that,
uh,

930
00:55:29.810 --> 00:55:30.900
this near lax,

931
00:55:31.230 --> 00:55:36.230
there's a great view of the planes coming in and they are close you.

932
00:55:36.440 --> 00:55:39.480
Oh yeah.
Once,
especially when they're taking off.
Yeah.
That's so true.

933
00:55:39.630 --> 00:55:43.560
No one's doing any security to keep you from putting a fucking antimissile or

934
00:55:43.561 --> 00:55:47.280
anti aircraft.
The slingshot,
honestly,
there's so close.

935
00:55:47.580 --> 00:55:51.870
What kind of slingshot that you,
Karen?
Well,
maybe I'm exaggerating,

936
00:55:51.950 --> 00:55:54.840
but not really.
If you break the window,
right.
I mean,

937
00:55:54.841 --> 00:55:58.560
could you break a window or shoot it into a turbine,
you know?
Oh,
you know,

938
00:55:58.561 --> 00:56:01.380
but they also had problems with that laser pointers.
People pointing,

939
00:56:01.381 --> 00:56:04.830
laser pointers,
it planes.
And that can be dangerous for pilots.
Yeah.

940
00:56:05.220 --> 00:56:08.940
Why not pilots like essentially running almost entirely on autopilot these days?

941
00:56:09.150 --> 00:56:12.360
I don't know.
All right.
Either.
Obviously not.

942
00:56:12.660 --> 00:56:15.770
Obviously they've got some control over what,
yeah,

943
00:56:15.990 --> 00:56:19.530
they certainly have some control,
but yeah.
You know,
there's a lot of like,

944
00:56:19.560 --> 00:56:24.040
we were so funny when we isolate threats.
Like,
I was thinking this

945
00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:26.020
<v 0>the other day while I was traveling,
you know,</v>

946
00:56:26.021 --> 00:56:28.210
we were going through the airport and you know,

947
00:56:28.211 --> 00:56:31.540
they're going through all your shit and they're scanning you and you're putting

948
00:56:31.541 --> 00:56:35.530
your hands over your head and the radio thing checks your body for weapons and

949
00:56:35.531 --> 00:56:38.860
you go through and you get the clear and you go.
But it's only the airport.

950
00:56:39.010 --> 00:56:42.400
There's this places where people congregate in by the thousands and there's

951
00:56:42.401 --> 00:56:44.560
virtually no security whatsoever.
Like malls.

952
00:56:44.900 --> 00:56:48.610
When was the last time nobody checks shit at the mall.
You go to the parking lot.

953
00:56:48.611 --> 00:56:52.990
It's filled with cars.
Yeah.
Times Square.
You go walk through.

954
00:56:52.991 --> 00:56:54.880
There's thousands of people in these malls.

955
00:56:55.400 --> 00:56:59.930
<v 3>Uh,
whenever I passed that security,
you know,
body scan screening,</v>

956
00:57:00.140 --> 00:57:04.900
I feel really good.
I really,
I feel like I did it.
I passed.

957
00:57:05.450 --> 00:57:08.770
Am I the only one?
I just,
I really loved that experience of like,

958
00:57:08.780 --> 00:57:12.200
I put my hands up,
the thing goes,
and then I stand there and the guy's like,
wait.

959
00:57:12.560 --> 00:57:16.760
And I'm like,
I'm clean,
I promise.
Then he hears it and he goes,
you can go ahead.

960
00:57:16.761 --> 00:57:21.110
And I'm like,
I did it.
I get credit for being not a threat and I love it.

961
00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:25.940
Why do you love me?
I don't know.
I think I'm a pleaser,
right at heart.

962
00:57:25.941 --> 00:57:29.210
I just want people to enjoy me and be happy with me.

963
00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:32.630
So walking through a metal detector and not having it go off.
Oh,

964
00:57:32.810 --> 00:57:37.460
I just could do that all day
if there's someone there watching going,
Yup,

965
00:57:37.900 --> 00:57:38.733
you're good,
you're good.

966
00:57:39.410 --> 00:57:44.410
That's an interesting admission ambassador to you don't feel this.

967
00:57:44.690 --> 00:57:46.880
It's not just relief.
It's like pride.

968
00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:49.410
<v 0>No I don't.
I definitely don't feel pride.</v>

969
00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:53.850
I definitely feel a slight relief.
Like,
okay,

970
00:57:53.851 --> 00:57:57.470
this is over.
Sure.
Cause I don't like the whole process.
Sure.

971
00:57:57.510 --> 00:57:59.550
I'm not a criminal and I'm not a threat.

972
00:57:59.580 --> 00:58:03.090
I'm not a terrorist and I don't have any plans on ever being one.

973
00:58:03.091 --> 00:58:07.980
So when I'm doing this,
I'm like,
this is just so crazy that this tiny minute one,

974
00:58:07.981 --> 00:58:10.680
100th of 1% of the population,

975
00:58:10.681 --> 00:58:13.690
if it's even that you ever have to worry about it.

976
00:58:13.691 --> 00:58:16.710
It's probably not even that statistically,
you know,
look,

977
00:58:16.711 --> 00:58:20.910
1% of the population means out of 100 million,
you have a million people,
right?

978
00:58:20.940 --> 00:58:24.720
That's 1% yeah.
So it's not that.

979
00:58:24.840 --> 00:58:28.440
So it's not that it's not evil.
It's very,
very,
very,
very,

980
00:58:28.441 --> 00:58:32.370
very small what the actual threat is.
But because of these fuckheads,

981
00:58:32.371 --> 00:58:36.120
these actual threats,
everyone has to be massively inconvenient.
Yeah.

982
00:58:36.510 --> 00:58:40.590
So I find it to be incredibly inefficient,
ridiculous,

983
00:58:40.620 --> 00:58:41.520
and almost,

984
00:58:43.260 --> 00:58:45.990
it almost sort of in forces,

985
00:58:45.991 --> 00:58:50.991
this idea of instability because although 99.999999999% of people are nothing to

986
00:58:53.311 --> 00:58:58.170
worry about because there is this minute tiny threat.

987
00:58:58.230 --> 00:59:01.470
Everyone has to be inconvenienced.
Everyone has to be a suspect,

988
00:59:01.950 --> 00:59:04.410
and you have to be treated by these.
You know,

989
00:59:04.411 --> 00:59:09.090
these people that are getting paid very little money in high stress situations,

990
00:59:09.091 --> 00:59:13.690
they're not experts.
It's sociology or psychology rather.
They're not,
you know,

991
00:59:13.710 --> 00:59:16.530
they're not experts in how their,
their,

992
00:59:16.860 --> 00:59:20.970
their behavior impacts people who are being treated like,

993
00:59:22.190 --> 00:59:25.250
yeah.
That,
that a job like that is fascinating.

994
00:59:25.600 --> 00:59:28.130
I want to do a documentary someday about people who,

995
00:59:28.580 --> 00:59:33.200
their job is to do something that everyone hates me.
Like a meter maid did.

996
00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:37.430
Was there a movie about meter maids and what it was like to just be like,

997
00:59:37.490 --> 00:59:41.390
all right,
time to start my job,
which literally is just being hated all day.

998
00:59:41.690 --> 00:59:44.330
Same with people who work at complaint departments.
Well,

999
00:59:44.331 --> 00:59:49.331
I worked as a security guard once for a concert venue and um,

1000
00:59:50.120 --> 00:59:52.910
you develop this us versus them mentality.

1001
00:59:52.910 --> 00:59:56.660
I only did it for a summer and just over the course of the summer,

1002
00:59:56.661 --> 00:59:57.770
because we were,

1003
00:59:57.920 --> 01:00:01.400
one of the things that we did was people were always trying to sneak in bottles

1004
01:00:01.401 --> 01:00:04.310
of booze.
The concert venue sold booze,

1005
01:00:04.311 --> 01:00:07.370
but obviously they were in paper cups and plastic cups.
Right.

1006
01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:10.790
But people would try to bring in bottles of wine,
like James Taylor concert.

1007
01:00:10.791 --> 01:00:13.340
Like we,
we busted more people with bottles of wine.

1008
01:00:13.390 --> 01:00:16.730
This James Taylor concert because everybody was trying to sneak them in their

1009
01:00:16.731 --> 01:00:19.240
purse,
right?
And we would check,
they'd be like,
no,
there's nothing in here.

1010
01:00:19.241 --> 01:00:21.440
And be like,
we have to check your purse.
Right?
Like,

1011
01:00:21.441 --> 01:00:22.460
why do you have to check my purse?

1012
01:00:22.490 --> 01:00:25.090
Because you might have a bottle of wine in there and they'll,

1013
01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:27.350
how do you know I have a bottle of wine because everybody has a fucking bottle

1014
01:00:27.351 --> 01:00:29.870
of wine.
It's a James Taylor concert.
Or you know,

1015
01:00:29.910 --> 01:00:33.260
like we're just going to come in and just have it,
nope,
can't do it,

1016
01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:37.670
but this is expensive.
Well,
go home and once you pass through that border,

1017
01:00:37.890 --> 01:00:42.590
right,
you can't bring it back,
you know,
it's over.
And um,
we would,

1018
01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:45.890
we would get these people that would be really angry at us,
like,

1019
01:00:45.891 --> 01:00:49.670
and real confrontational and how to add al just,
you know,

1020
01:00:49.671 --> 01:00:52.030
three months of me working there,
you,
you,

1021
01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:55.580
you develop this mentality where you like,
you know,
the fuck these people,

1022
01:00:55.581 --> 01:00:59.180
these people were assholes.
Like,
and that's just us versus them.
It just people,

1023
01:00:59.210 --> 01:00:59.900
right?

1024
01:00:59.900 --> 01:01:04.580
But because you're the one whose job is to enforce it and they're angry at you,

1025
01:01:04.581 --> 01:01:08.030
you develop this very conf confrontational relationship.
Yeah.

1026
01:01:08.450 --> 01:01:10.220
It was very weird and I noticed it.

1027
01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:14.510
It was super unhealthy and I decided after the one summer,
they're like,

1028
01:01:14.511 --> 01:01:17.810
I'm never doing this again,
but someone has to do that job.
Do they though?

1029
01:01:18.530 --> 01:01:21.470
Good question.
I don't know if they do.
You know,

1030
01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:26.270
I do not know if someone really needs to do that job.
I think,
um,
first of all,

1031
01:01:26.271 --> 01:01:29.750
if you just say don't bring any bags,
like what's the worst thing?

1032
01:01:29.751 --> 01:01:33.410
Someone bringing in a flask and they're gonna start a riot where everybody pulls

1033
01:01:33.411 --> 01:01:36.680
out their flasks and throws them at the same time and you know,

1034
01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:40.700
falls from the sky.
These fucking,
I don't know.
You know,
I don't,
I don't know.

1035
01:01:40.701 --> 01:01:44.780
But the job sucks.
Yeah.
And everywhere you go,

1036
01:01:44.781 --> 01:01:47.630
people were trying to get over on you and everywhere.
And that's minor.

1037
01:01:47.631 --> 01:01:51.710
That's just,
most of the people weren't bringing in stuff.
It was,
you know,

1038
01:01:51.711 --> 01:01:53.270
a small percentage,
you know,
and that,

1039
01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:56.180
that is that there's a distinction between that job and I'm working at a

1040
01:01:56.181 --> 01:01:58.700
complaint department where the complaint department,

1041
01:01:58.701 --> 01:02:01.940
maybe you're helping people with the problem they're experiencing,

1042
01:02:02.190 --> 01:02:05.390
but if all you do is stop people from bringing in the bottle of wine that they

1043
01:02:05.391 --> 01:02:09.620
want to have theirs,
you never,
you don't like work with them to make it work.

1044
01:02:09.710 --> 01:02:12.890
Yeah.
Good point.
That's a really good point.
Yeah.
Complaint departments,

1045
01:02:12.891 --> 01:02:17.390
they fucking hate it.
People hate it.
You know,
they hate that Gig.
Yeah.

1046
01:02:17.420 --> 01:02:19.140
I'm a Meta.
May would be the worst,
I think,

1047
01:02:19.141 --> 01:02:23.370
or one of the cops are one of the worst.
I always tell people like,
you know,

1048
01:02:23.550 --> 01:02:28.330
there's people like fuck cops.
I hate cops.
The cops are just people.
Okay.

1049
01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:33.150
People can vary.
They can be wonderful and they can be terrible.
And the,

1050
01:02:33.151 --> 01:02:38.130
if you imagine what it would be like if almost everyone you talk to is a to you,

1051
01:02:38.580 --> 01:02:41.760
almost everyone you talked to is in the middle of a crime that they don't want

1052
01:02:41.761 --> 01:02:43.590
you to figure out there in the middle of a crime.

1053
01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:46.230
Everyone's speeding and their lot.
I didn't know I was speeding.

1054
01:02:46.380 --> 01:02:49.140
Like you're just dealing with liars all day or you have you been drinking

1055
01:02:49.141 --> 01:02:52.440
certain,
no,
dude,
you fucking smell like alcohol.

1056
01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:55.890
Get out of the car ass all and you just like enough,
you're tired,

1057
01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:58.200
tired of your life being threatened by these people.

1058
01:02:58.420 --> 01:03:03.360
You're tired of the having to enforce these laws and nobody wants to listen and

1059
01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:07.770
they develop.
They're the worst to developing this US versus them mentality.

1060
01:03:08.210 --> 01:03:11.750
You think about 20 years as a police officer and all the,
the,

1061
01:03:11.790 --> 01:03:14.340
your perception of people,
you know,

1062
01:03:14.790 --> 01:03:19.680
it would be like asking a proc tologist what,
you know,
what asshole smell like.

1063
01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:23.010
Right.
You know,
like you're only dealing with people with like asshole problems,

1064
01:03:23.430 --> 01:03:26.430
you know?
Yeah,
exactly.
Yeah,

1065
01:03:26.431 --> 01:03:29.640
it's human beings are very bizarre man.
We're very bizarre.

1066
01:03:29.641 --> 01:03:34.410
And our solutions for dealing with issues oftentimes create new issues.

1067
01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:39.270
And I think that is most certainly the case with the TSA.

1068
01:03:39.300 --> 01:03:42.710
And I think that's most certainly the case.
The police,
I think w are,

1069
01:03:42.740 --> 01:03:46.920
are ways of handling things,
create greater issues.

1070
01:03:48.550 --> 01:03:50.440
<v 4>Did I talk about humans all the time?</v>

1071
01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:55.680
And I often compares to animals and animals don't have any of these problems or

1072
01:03:55.691 --> 01:03:59.890
do they?
But they would.
They would.
What if,
what if they could lie,

1073
01:04:00.310 --> 01:04:02.080
right?
Can a dog lie?

1074
01:04:02.130 --> 01:04:04.380
<v 0>If they could,
they'd be lying like a motherfucker.</v>

1075
01:04:04.620 --> 01:04:07.350
Could you imagine if a dog ate your steak?

1076
01:04:07.380 --> 01:04:10.050
Like if you put a steak on the counter and the dog ate it and you like,

1077
01:04:10.051 --> 01:04:11.570
did you eat my stag?
He's like,
no,

1078
01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:15.330
<v 4>no.
Right.
No food.
But if a dog could talk,</v>

1079
01:04:15.810 --> 01:04:16.740
could it lie?

1080
01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:20.070
That's one of the biggest problem with comparing the humans and animals is that

1081
01:04:20.071 --> 01:04:22.740
we can't ask the animal questions and get feedback from them.

1082
01:04:22.741 --> 01:04:26.610
We have to just think,
well,
the dog ate the steak and now he's,

1083
01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:32.640
you know,
involved in some other act dog activity.
But how does he lie?

1084
01:04:32.670 --> 01:04:36.450
Because I can't ask him if he did it or not.
Ken,
Ken,
it can a dog be deceptive.

1085
01:04:36.810 --> 01:04:39.630
Right?
And you could maybe teach a dog that like if you,

1086
01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:41.580
if you cover this thing up,
I won't know,

1087
01:04:41.581 --> 01:04:45.540
but is the dog actually intending to cover it or does the dog just know that

1088
01:04:45.541 --> 01:04:50.160
this action means this result?
Right?
Is it lying?
And,

1089
01:04:50.270 --> 01:04:53.930
and that's a fantastic question.
It is,
uh,

1090
01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:57.120
do they have the capacity for deception,
right?
Is that a complex?

1091
01:04:57.150 --> 01:04:59.700
What's really fun is trying to figure out how to even test it.

1092
01:05:00.180 --> 01:05:04.680
How can I prove that this dog can lie?
Right?
That's a very difficult,

1093
01:05:04.770 --> 01:05:07.380
and we still haven't been able to do it.
Well,
here's one.
Yeah.

1094
01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:10.320
I don't think they can lie,
but cats,

1095
01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:15.390
when a cat is creeping up on a bird,
aren't they lying?
I mean,

1096
01:05:15.391 --> 01:05:18.040
they're being deceptive.
There's slowly

1097
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:20.710
<v 0>moved.
Cause they don't want you to perceive that they're there.</v>

1098
01:05:20.820 --> 01:05:24.090
<v 4>That's a great point.
There's clearly a lot of deception in the animal kingdom.</v>

1099
01:05:24.270 --> 01:05:28.860
Camouflage shorts,
but a Venus fly traps,
even in the plant world,

1100
01:05:29.670 --> 01:05:34.440
this is just a beautiful flower snap.
Right?
This jail I'm going to eat you.

1101
01:05:34.590 --> 01:05:39.000
Here's another question.
If I took a monkey like that was in the jungle,
right.

1102
01:05:39.300 --> 01:05:44.300
And I time traveled him back 8,000 years and I put them back in that same jungle

1103
01:05:46.140 --> 01:05:49.920
with other monkeys.
Be Like what?
You're of monkey from the future.

1104
01:05:49.921 --> 01:05:50.790
You're so different.

1105
01:05:51.900 --> 01:05:55.530
Maybe not 8,000 but maybe half a million,
half a million.
Sure.

1106
01:05:55.531 --> 01:05:58.650
But if I took you and sent you back just 200 years,

1107
01:05:59.100 --> 01:06:02.490
you would be from the future and it people would freak out.
I would run shit,

1108
01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:06.720
you would run it,
but no,
no,
no,
no.
I would munch shit.
Does monkey culture,

1109
01:06:06.721 --> 01:06:11.160
does dog culture change at the same speed?
Right.
With the dogs be like,
ah,

1110
01:06:11.161 --> 01:06:15.480
whatever.
It's the year 10,000 BC.
It's fine.
Dogs are still dogs,

1111
01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:19.510
but humans can't time travel and fit in that well.
Well there's so many

1112
01:06:19.570 --> 01:06:22.660
<v 0>less variables in the dog world because they don't communicate.</v>

1113
01:06:23.140 --> 01:06:27.100
They don't have a database of information that drawing from that I've languages.

1114
01:06:27.101 --> 01:06:31.090
So the difference between a person of 200 years ago and a dog from 200 years
ago,

1115
01:06:31.091 --> 01:06:33.790
I think a dog would be exactly the same 200 years ago.

1116
01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:37.750
I don't think there would be,
of course,
different breeds,
you know,

1117
01:06:37.751 --> 01:06:40.420
like that people have engineered.
Sure,
sure.

1118
01:06:40.470 --> 01:06:45.010
Pit Bowls and poodles that wouldn't exist 200 years ago that have been,

1119
01:06:45.460 --> 01:06:49.780
I mean,
I have a dog,
it's called a regency mastiff and it's a massive,

1120
01:06:49.781 --> 01:06:53.890
that's been engineered by a friend of mine and he actually took a bunch of

1121
01:06:54.070 --> 01:06:58.810
different types of dogs and he bred a smaller mass if that's more athletic.
Wow.

1122
01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:03.220
And he also made sure that these dogs are,
have no dog aggression,
no people,

1123
01:07:03.221 --> 01:07:05.840
aggression.
Like this is sweetest dog ever.
Like my,

1124
01:07:05.860 --> 01:07:10.030
my three year old would just go up to it and grab it and grab her arms around

1125
01:07:10.031 --> 01:07:13.150
his neck and he would kiss her.
And it's like,
I never worry about this dog.

1126
01:07:13.151 --> 01:07:15.940
He's the sweetest and it's because he was engineered,

1127
01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:20.100
but in engineered over the course of a couple of decades by a friend.
Yeah.

1128
01:07:20.220 --> 01:07:23.710
So I know like the whole lineage.
I know how it all started.
It's really,

1129
01:07:23.711 --> 01:07:28.000
really fascinating.
Dogs or technology and a lot of ways.
Yeah.
Yeah,

1130
01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:33.100
they don't,
they don't have the database.
Like if you could go back 200 years ago,

1131
01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:36.340
you would be the wizard of the future,
you know,

1132
01:07:36.370 --> 01:07:39.700
how many years do you have what you have in your head?
I mean with you,

1133
01:07:39.701 --> 01:07:41.680
what you've accumulated and when you're,

1134
01:07:41.740 --> 01:07:46.350
if you could go back in time with the fucking iPad and your vsauce um,

1135
01:07:46.810 --> 01:07:48.910
videos on youtube,
my God,

1136
01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:53.590
<v 4>you would be one king maybe.
But could I convince people?
Uh,</v>

1137
01:07:53.830 --> 01:07:56.440
just,
just knowing,
um,

1138
01:07:57.190 --> 01:08:00.100
something about the moon doesn't mean that they're going to believe me.

1139
01:08:00.370 --> 01:08:00.761
And that's,

1140
01:08:00.761 --> 01:08:03.160
that's one of the things people don't think about when they imagine being the

1141
01:08:03.161 --> 01:08:06.070
king.
If they could travel back in time.
Is that,
sure.

1142
01:08:06.071 --> 01:08:09.370
You could explain to people that where you're from,
everyone has a cell phone,

1143
01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:14.380
but could you invent one for them?
No.
Could you put a satellite up into orbit?
No,

1144
01:08:14.381 --> 01:08:18.050
but you could explain that in the future.
People will put things into orbit.

1145
01:08:18.410 --> 01:08:22.850
But would you know more about how to get something into orbit than just some

1146
01:08:23.330 --> 01:08:27.500
random guy from the year 1200?
I certainly wouldn't,

1147
01:08:27.530 --> 01:08:30.770
but some people would.
You probably would.
Well,

1148
01:08:30.970 --> 01:08:33.950
I certainly know more than I would,
but you would wait.

1149
01:08:33.951 --> 01:08:35.630
You would know way more than they would.

1150
01:08:35.660 --> 01:08:38.180
They would have to listen to you if you had an iPad.

1151
01:08:38.181 --> 01:08:40.100
They'd fucking for sure know how helpful I'd be.

1152
01:08:40.101 --> 01:08:42.950
I wouldn't know what kind of propelling us to use.
I would just be like,

1153
01:08:43.100 --> 01:08:46.910
we need something strong enough to escape Earth's gravity.
And they'd be like,

1154
01:08:46.911 --> 01:08:51.860
well,
okay,
but what is that?
And I'm like,
well,
I don't exactly know.

1155
01:08:51.861 --> 01:08:53.840
I know that,
uh,
uh,

1156
01:08:53.841 --> 01:08:58.040
the space shuttle had a liquid fuel and it's tank and it had solid fuel and it's

1157
01:08:58.041 --> 01:09:01.280
solid rocket boosters,
the SRBs.
And they'll be like,
okay,

1158
01:09:01.910 --> 01:09:06.230
but what is the fuel made of?
I'm like,
I don't know.
Where do we get the fuel?

1159
01:09:06.231 --> 01:09:07.760
I don't know.
Well,

1160
01:09:07.790 --> 01:09:12.790
you kind of have an understanding of explosions and propellant and things that

1161
01:09:12.921 --> 01:09:17.690
are flammable,
but does that mean that I could build a rocket?
Can I explain to a,

1162
01:09:17.780 --> 01:09:19.910
uh,
a cultured how to make one?

1163
01:09:20.180 --> 01:09:23.860
<v 0>Well that's one of the cool things about human beings is that we,</v>

1164
01:09:24.030 --> 01:09:28.460
we work on each other's work totally.
And without like they're,

1165
01:09:28.730 --> 01:09:32.750
you know,
Obama came under a lot of criticism for this whole,
uh,
you know,

1166
01:09:32.751 --> 01:09:35.940
you didn't build it thing like if you built a small business,
you didn't bill,

1167
01:09:35.941 --> 01:09:39.050
you didn't build that infrastructure,
you didn't build those.
But that is kind of,

1168
01:09:39.290 --> 01:09:39.800
it was,

1169
01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:44.300
I don't think he was eloquently put and it left open a lot of room for counter.

1170
01:09:44.690 --> 01:09:48.920
But the reality of it is every single thing that any human being has invented

1171
01:09:48.950 --> 01:09:52.790
only took place because someone invented the ability to communicate some of the

1172
01:09:52.791 --> 01:09:54.980
village uh,
invented education.

1173
01:09:55.130 --> 01:09:59.160
Someone invented a society that's civil enough that you could think and,

1174
01:09:59.220 --> 01:10:02.360
and pontificate on these things and not have to worry about the barbarians

1175
01:10:02.361 --> 01:10:04.160
coming over the hills with fucking spears.

1176
01:10:04.370 --> 01:10:08.000
Like all of this only takes place because all,
I mean,

1177
01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:10.160
the only reason why you can build a rocket,

1178
01:10:10.161 --> 01:10:13.430
it's cause someone built alloys because someone filled out fit,

1179
01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:15.830
figured out propellant cause someone figured out,

1180
01:10:15.831 --> 01:10:20.831
contained explosion because someone figured out velocity and speed and how much

1181
01:10:21.261 --> 01:10:25.220
energy you actually have to have to escape the energy of gravity pulling you

1182
01:10:25.221 --> 01:10:29.750
down and all those,
the,
the,
the pull of the earth and then the,
you know,

1183
01:10:29.751 --> 01:10:32.330
the resistance of air and all these different variables.

1184
01:10:32.570 --> 01:10:37.570
There had to be untold number of people that had figured these things out before

1185
01:10:37.701 --> 01:10:39.650
you came along with your next step.
Right?
Right.

1186
01:10:39.810 --> 01:10:42.000
<v 4>So how valuable would I be to people in the past?</v>

1187
01:10:42.001 --> 01:10:45.840
I feel like I'd be most valuable when it came to just like all the jokes that I

1188
01:10:45.841 --> 01:10:50.130
know that comedians made up in between the past and now.

1189
01:10:50.340 --> 01:10:54.000
But I don't know how helpful I'd be about just like,
oh,

1190
01:10:54.001 --> 01:10:56.400
you guys didn't know there's a better way to grow corn.
Like we,

1191
01:10:56.401 --> 01:11:01.290
like corn is really cheap,
uh,
from where I'm from.
And they're like,
okay,

1192
01:11:01.291 --> 01:11:04.170
but how do you grow that?
And I'm like,
well,
I don't know exactly how they do it.

1193
01:11:04.220 --> 01:11:07.950
You guys know about Monsanto.
Will they make a,
you know,

1194
01:11:07.951 --> 01:11:12.660
special seeds that,
uh,
their,
you know,
their pesticides will own,
will not kill,

1195
01:11:12.860 --> 01:11:14.050
just do that.
And

1196
01:11:14.050 --> 01:11:15.690
<v 3>then I'd be like,
what's a pesticide?
And I'm like,
well,
I don't know.</v>

1197
01:11:15.691 --> 01:11:20.340
It's like a chemical that,
that kills pests.
And they're like,
well great.

1198
01:11:20.341 --> 01:11:24.930
You're just making up fictional stories.
Right.
I can do that too if the cars fly.

1199
01:11:24.990 --> 01:11:27.690
There you go.
Cause I mean,
you can build one over time though.

1200
01:11:27.900 --> 01:11:31.440
<v 1>Be able to explain enough that you'd be completely fascinating.
Um,</v>

1201
01:11:31.830 --> 01:11:36.250
I was watching a documentary recently about locust,
about the,
uh,

1202
01:11:36.270 --> 01:11:41.270
various times throughout history where locus and filled the sky like clouds of

1203
01:11:41.620 --> 01:11:45.210
locusts.
And it was about the old west and,
uh,

1204
01:11:45.211 --> 01:11:49.860
the army being brought in to deliver food to these poor people that had a,

1205
01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:53.760
that lived in,
you know,
the 1800 or 1700 or whatever the fuck it was.

1206
01:11:53.970 --> 01:11:57.090
But they had these black and white photos of the army and then they're bringing

1207
01:11:57.091 --> 01:12:01.140
in these,
these wagons filled with food and these poor people there.

1208
01:12:01.230 --> 01:12:06.030
Their crops just been completely devastated by these these things that just

1209
01:12:06.031 --> 01:12:09.710
showed up.
I'll fill the sky,
these grasshoppers and you know,

1210
01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:14.100
if you could go back and talk to those people and explained pesticides and shit

1211
01:12:14.460 --> 01:12:15.350
and like this is a,

1212
01:12:15.460 --> 01:12:19.920
what we need to do is find the root cause of the problem and find these bugs and

1213
01:12:19.921 --> 01:12:22.500
keep them from,
from breeding and like they'd be like,

1214
01:12:22.501 --> 01:12:27.030
what the fuck are you talking about?
Like pesticides,
what is that?
Well,

1215
01:12:27.031 --> 01:12:28.880
it's chemical that you spray on and keeps the

1216
01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:32.010
<v 3>right that's from many food.
Like cooking.</v>

1217
01:12:32.070 --> 01:12:35.550
Like if I went back to before there was pizza,

1218
01:12:35.910 --> 01:12:40.530
I could probably still make a pizza because as long as bread had still been like

1219
01:12:40.590 --> 01:12:44.160
invented and there was cheese and meat,

1220
01:12:44.310 --> 01:12:46.920
I could combine them in the right way to make a pizza.

1221
01:12:47.250 --> 01:12:51.270
I Dunno how to make exactly make pizza dough from the Greens had have back in

1222
01:12:51.271 --> 01:12:55.050
the past.
But that could blow people's mind.
If I made a really delicious pizza

1223
01:12:55.150 --> 01:12:57.940
<v 1>hug,
be hard to get yeast.
Where do you get used?</v>

1224
01:12:59.210 --> 01:13:01.150
<v 3>Uh,
from the store?
See,
that's the problem.</v>

1225
01:13:02.890 --> 01:13:06.820
And this was really well put in a show called connections,
um,

1226
01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:10.450
that there was on television a long time ago.
Uh,
in the very first episode.

1227
01:13:10.451 --> 01:13:14.920
The guy's like,
what if everyone on earth disappeared?
What would you do?

1228
01:13:14.921 --> 01:13:17.110
And everyone's like,
oh,
I know what I do.
I'd like,
you know,

1229
01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:20.410
find a farm and I could grow food.
And he's like,
really?
You could grow food.

1230
01:13:20.620 --> 01:13:23.020
When do you plant these seeds?
How far down the,
you'd plant them?

1231
01:13:23.021 --> 01:13:27.760
And everyone goes,
oh,
okay.
Nope.
I don't know.
Well,
you,

1232
01:13:28.230 --> 01:13:31.540
<v 1>it would probably be able to figure out a lot of shit.
You know,</v>

1233
01:13:31.541 --> 01:13:36.040
if you had a farm,
if you had a,
well,
if you had animals,

1234
01:13:36.430 --> 01:13:40.930
you would PR,
you're a smart guy.
He'd probably be able to get out a lot of shit.

1235
01:13:40.931 --> 01:13:44.410
You'd definitely make some errors,
but you'd be able to figure out a lot of shit.

1236
01:13:44.980 --> 01:13:46.540
I think you're right.
Yeah,
you're right.

1237
01:13:46.690 --> 01:13:50.740
The real part problem would be reengineering,
you know,
the,

1238
01:13:50.741 --> 01:13:54.370
the really complex stuff like communications networks.

1239
01:13:54.690 --> 01:13:57.600
And that would be mean.
That would be over.
I mean,
if,

1240
01:13:57.820 --> 01:14:00.130
if it was only up to,
you know,

1241
01:14:00.131 --> 01:14:05.131
if you could get a random group of a hundred people just completely random and

1242
01:14:05.411 --> 01:14:09.880
they wouldn't be the only people that survive,
we would be caveman.
I mean,

1243
01:14:09.881 --> 01:14:12.040
we literally,
if

1244
01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:12.341
<v 0>we,</v>

1245
01:14:12.341 --> 01:14:17.230
if you only had a hundred people and we removed all of the technology we have

1246
01:14:17.231 --> 01:14:22.231
today and the hundred people had to move forward and progress just based on the

1247
01:14:22.991 --> 01:14:27.190
information that they have inside their heads,
fuck,
good luck.

1248
01:14:27.670 --> 01:14:30.100
We in.
That's the weird thing about the human organism.

1249
01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:33.640
It really is a giant super organism that needs to itself.

1250
01:14:33.990 --> 01:14:34.823
<v 3>Yeah,
that's right there.</v>

1251
01:14:34.830 --> 01:14:37.890
There are definitely people you would want to be in that group of hundred and

1252
01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:40.860
people that you wouldn't,
wouldn't be nearly as helpful.
Sure.

1253
01:14:41.570 --> 01:14:44.990
<v 0>But we need a balance each other out.
Maybe the people that were in that group,</v>

1254
01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:47.240
maybe they had some great ideas scientifically,

1255
01:14:47.241 --> 01:14:49.650
but maybe they were fucked up socially.
Um,

1256
01:14:49.820 --> 01:14:54.820
maybe they couldn't deal with having the responsibility of being the Alpha,

1257
01:14:55.100 --> 01:14:57.200
you know,
maybe it's a bad look.

1258
01:14:57.201 --> 01:15:02.201
We've all seen people that get attention or that get a press or rather fame and

1259
01:15:03.501 --> 01:15:06.620
then it goes to their head and they become crazy.
And to become cult leaders,

1260
01:15:06.980 --> 01:15:11.660
you know,
it's a bad mix for them.
Right.
You know,
and then other people handle it.

1261
01:15:11.690 --> 01:15:12.051
You know,

1262
01:15:12.051 --> 01:15:17.051
Jimmy Carter style with eloquence and grace like him in a position of power and

1263
01:15:17.181 --> 01:15:22.120
influence,
he becomes more introspective,
more,
you know,
more passionate,

1264
01:15:22.130 --> 01:15:24.920
more compassionate.
Whereas other people just be,

1265
01:15:24.921 --> 01:15:26.600
just start believing their own bullshit.

1266
01:15:26.601 --> 01:15:30.110
And like what if there's one out of 100 believes his own bullshit and he's like

1267
01:15:30.230 --> 01:15:32.720
ordering us around and like,
oh well this fucking guy.

1268
01:15:32.870 --> 01:15:35.810
Well he thinks just because he knows how to grow corn,
he can tell us what to do.

1269
01:15:35.811 --> 01:15:39.200
Right?
You develop a whole new set of social issues.

1270
01:15:39.490 --> 01:15:42.550
<v 3>I want to see the first person to become king.</v>

1271
01:15:43.150 --> 01:15:46.990
I was on Wikipedia the other day looking at like the queen of England,
I guess.

1272
01:15:47.260 --> 01:15:51.310
And I could just keep clicking back in to find the previous ruler.

1273
01:15:51.910 --> 01:15:54.010
And I was like,
how far back does this go?

1274
01:15:54.520 --> 01:15:58.870
Where's the first guy who one day was like,
Hey,

1275
01:15:59.260 --> 01:16:02.260
could you get me that thing?
Why?
Uh,

1276
01:16:02.380 --> 01:16:06.580
because I'm kidding.
Yeah,
that's a new thing I just invented.

1277
01:16:06.790 --> 01:16:10.710
Like where did that come from?
I want to witness the,
um,

1278
01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:14.020
I can imagine all kinds of scenarios.
Like something happened,
you know,

1279
01:16:14.021 --> 01:16:17.620
a lightning struck and a tree caught fire and someone said,
I caused that.

1280
01:16:17.621 --> 01:16:20.320
Now you all have to obey me.
I have this like divine authority.

1281
01:16:20.500 --> 01:16:24.610
And that's where it came from.
But the idea of the,
the leaders emerging that way,

1282
01:16:25.060 --> 01:16:27.070
maybe they just were the strongest person.
I don't know.

1283
01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:31.180
<v 0>It probably definitely started off with who couldn't fuck everybody up.</v>

1284
01:16:31.660 --> 01:16:34.870
It probably started off with who can pick up the heaviest sword?

1285
01:16:34.871 --> 01:16:38.290
Who's the biggest,
yeah,
it has.
I mean that's how it is in the primate world.

1286
01:16:38.291 --> 01:16:40.120
If we run it to go back to the primate world,

1287
01:16:40.150 --> 01:16:43.390
the Alpha is the one with the most sharpest teeth,
the biggest muscles,
the,

1288
01:16:43.530 --> 01:16:47.950
the largest body.
I mean that's,
that's what they are.
If you go to champs,

1289
01:16:47.951 --> 01:16:52.180
if you go to lions,
if you go to any,
any animal that doesn't have a language,

1290
01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:54.760
that's the,
there's the leader of the tribe,

1291
01:16:54.790 --> 01:16:59.020
there's the Alpha lion that comes in and all the male lions have to scatter

1292
01:16:59.021 --> 01:17:01.270
until he's challenged by a new young lion.

1293
01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:04.930
And then he's forced into exile and has to fend for himself.
Right?

1294
01:17:04.931 --> 01:17:09.630
Happens with wolves.
It happens with all sorts of primates.
You know,
the,

1295
01:17:09.631 --> 01:17:11.660
the Alpha being that,
I mean,
the,

1296
01:17:11.810 --> 01:17:16.810
the one leader and that also probably serves a function of the one leader serves

1297
01:17:17.931 --> 01:17:18.890
it's function of,

1298
01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:24.400
there has to be some sort of competition in order for them to continue to

1299
01:17:26.241 --> 01:17:31.190
progress.
And so this competition for,
for breeding rights,
you know,

1300
01:17:31.220 --> 01:17:34.610
ensure strength and diversity.
You know,

1301
01:17:34.611 --> 01:17:38.420
this competition also manifest itself when it comes to the human world.

1302
01:17:38.570 --> 01:17:41.780
If one can figure out how to dominate all that,

1303
01:17:41.781 --> 01:17:45.230
well that's an interesting trait and you can get some shit done if you could

1304
01:17:45.231 --> 01:17:49.640
figure that out.
But then others need to challenge this one because you know why?

1305
01:17:49.641 --> 01:17:50.840
You know,
it can't be stagnant.

1306
01:17:50.870 --> 01:17:54.200
There has to be new new challenges in new competition.

1307
01:17:54.201 --> 01:17:57.620
And then everybody will have to elevate their game accordingly because of this.

1308
01:17:57.621 --> 01:18:02.390
And that's sort of eventually what leads us to 2014 [inaudible] America.

1309
01:18:03.020 --> 01:18:06.710
I mean,
that's essentially what's going on right now.
Right here we are sort of,

1310
01:18:06.740 --> 01:18:09.800
but now it's become bizarre and it's not really one,

1311
01:18:09.801 --> 01:18:11.300
it's one that's a figurehead,

1312
01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:16.100
which is controlled by other giant groups of individuals,

1313
01:18:16.101 --> 01:18:19.850
which would call corporations and military industrial complex and all these

1314
01:18:19.851 --> 01:18:24.851
different various points of influence that are trying to change the course of

1315
01:18:25.041 --> 01:18:29.330
how things are done in order to benefit themselves or their group.

1316
01:18:29.780 --> 01:18:32.330
And that means it's essentially like Alpha male shit,

1317
01:18:32.540 --> 01:18:36.470
but on this really bizarre and distorted scale.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1318
01:18:37.050 --> 01:18:39.660
I mean it's really just the same as monkeys,
right?
It's that,
yeah.

1319
01:18:39.740 --> 01:18:43.620
Sharp tea analogy is very,
very clear.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1320
01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:47.360
But also constantly in competition and moving forward.

1321
01:18:47.630 --> 01:18:49.250
And there's folks that want to say,
well,

1322
01:18:49.251 --> 01:18:53.570
that competition should stop and this is all terrible and morally and ethically.

1323
01:18:53.571 --> 01:18:57.770
Absolutely.
I agree with you 100% for the sake of the human race.
Sure.

1324
01:18:57.771 --> 01:19:02.180
For the sake of children and education and poverty.
Absolutely.
I'm with you,

1325
01:19:02.420 --> 01:19:07.420
but as an objective observer that's standing back and looking at what has got us

1326
01:19:07.521 --> 01:19:09.950
to this point,
it has been all of that.

1327
01:19:09.951 --> 01:19:11.960
It has been all this competition for dominance.

1328
01:19:12.170 --> 01:19:16.550
It's been all this weird alpha stuff.
I mean that's what's,

1329
01:19:16.580 --> 01:19:19.760
that's what's led to this point,
having these conversations.

1330
01:19:19.890 --> 01:19:24.680
Stan sitting over a laptop and talking on the Internet and it was some really

1331
01:19:24.681 --> 01:19:25.770
fascinating people.

1332
01:19:25.771 --> 01:19:30.620
I had to figure this out and there had to be a certain amount of compensation

1333
01:19:30.680 --> 01:19:32.600
for their efforts,
for their efforts,

1334
01:19:32.630 --> 01:19:37.630
like Microsoft achieve this global dominance as this gigantic promoter of,

1335
01:19:39.501 --> 01:19:41.770
of,
of computers because of the,

1336
01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:46.840
this is a massive amount of reward involved in that Bill Gates is $93 billion.

1337
01:19:47.510 --> 01:19:50.390
I mean it wasn't,
this wasn't entirely altruistic.
People can talk.

1338
01:19:50.391 --> 01:19:54.440
All they want about Bill Gates is the amount of money he's given to charity and

1339
01:19:54.500 --> 01:19:56.660
he's $93 billion.

1340
01:19:56.661 --> 01:20:01.100
You really need to have some huge charitable programs going on because otherwise

1341
01:20:01.101 --> 01:20:04.580
you're just gonna look,
when I'm honest,
when I was a kid,
it was always like,

1342
01:20:05.090 --> 01:20:08.190
can I just write bill gates to me $1 million?

1343
01:20:08.190 --> 01:20:11.520
<v 4>Like that's such a small amount of his is his net worth?</v>

1344
01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:13.800
Couldn't you just give me a million?
Would be awesome.

1345
01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:17.260
<v 0>What could you imagine being a guy that has that kind of money running into</v>

1346
01:20:17.261 --> 01:20:21.400
people?
Like I'm not that kind of rich by any stretch of the imagination,

1347
01:20:21.401 --> 01:20:25.590
but I constantly run into people that want me to fund their projects.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1348
01:20:25.810 --> 01:20:30.810
And there's not enough time in the world to engage these people and become a

1349
01:20:32.861 --> 01:20:36.400
part of their life and their world.
So they just want you to just like,
listen,

1350
01:20:36.401 --> 01:20:37.270
you don't have to be involved.

1351
01:20:37.271 --> 01:20:39.700
Just give me the money and I'll get the fuck outta here,
man.

1352
01:20:39.950 --> 01:20:43.120
You gotta get your own money.
Like,
I don't have time for this.
Like this is,
well,

1353
01:20:43.121 --> 01:20:45.940
you don't even have to think about it.
But I would because I would,

1354
01:20:45.941 --> 01:20:48.250
if I gave you money,
I'd be thinking about like,
and I don't,

1355
01:20:48.280 --> 01:20:49.720
I'm not involved in your project,

1356
01:20:50.020 --> 01:20:53.770
but I'm minuscule in comparison to a guy like Bill Gates.

1357
01:20:53.830 --> 01:20:54.663
<v 4>Right.
I,</v>

1358
01:20:54.750 --> 01:20:59.200
I think it really is true that the whole story,

1359
01:20:59.201 --> 01:21:04.201
but if Bill Gates walked down the street and saw a quarter in the street and he

1360
01:21:04.691 --> 01:21:07.750
like got went out of his way to pick it up,
he would lose money.

1361
01:21:07.860 --> 01:21:11.620
If we found $100 who was this money?
$100.

1362
01:21:11.621 --> 01:21:14.770
It would cost him more time.
Yes.
Of his time.
And you need,

1363
01:21:14.771 --> 01:21:18.910
or the folded it and put it in his wallet.
I don't have the time for that shit.

1364
01:21:18.940 --> 01:21:20.620
Can you imagine being so,

1365
01:21:20.860 --> 01:21:25.860
so important and valuable that like just folding your own money is not worth it?

1366
01:21:26.140 --> 01:21:30.580
Well also there's a weird thing of you become this bizarre target.
Yeah.

1367
01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:34.290
<v 0>You're,
you're,
you're a bank.
You're a walking bank.
Yeah.</v>

1368
01:21:34.530 --> 01:21:37.620
Like all someone have to do is grab Bill Gates and lock them in a room and say,

1369
01:21:37.621 --> 01:21:41.610
listen,
I'll let you out man,
but I need $1 million for him.
That's nothing,
right?

1370
01:21:41.700 --> 01:21:44.670
$1 million when you have 93,000 million.

1371
01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:45.500
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

1372
01:21:45.500 --> 01:21:48.260
I mean obviously he doesn't have like a bank account with that much cause he

1373
01:21:48.261 --> 01:21:52.160
could withdraw a lot of the other assets and it's not,
it's not all liquid.

1374
01:21:52.161 --> 01:21:53.920
But I wonder,
yeah,
if,

1375
01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:58.700
if we asked him to just produce by the end of this week,
a pile of cash,

1376
01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:02.360
how big of a pile of cash could he produce in a week?

1377
01:22:02.510 --> 01:22:06.760
<v 0>How much would that change someone's life or a group of people's lives or a</v>

1378
01:22:06.761 --> 01:22:11.140
community's life?
If Bill Gates decided,
okay,
I'm going to create utopia,

1379
01:22:11.590 --> 01:22:15.610
I'm going to go to Tijuana and I'm going to buy it,
I'm going to buy everything.

1380
01:22:15.611 --> 01:22:18.320
How much would it cost to buy everything in Tor

1381
01:22:18.690 --> 01:22:20.720
<v 4>free one and have them all agree to this,</v>

1382
01:22:21.750 --> 01:22:24.750
<v 0>hire everyone and give everyone like healthy,</v>

1383
01:22:24.751 --> 01:22:27.840
organic food and set up farms,

1384
01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:33.010
give people really high paying jobs and like build,

1385
01:22:33.210 --> 01:22:35.640
rebuild the entire infrastructure.

1386
01:22:35.641 --> 01:22:40.140
And could he create a utopia with $93 billion or is that not enough?
You

1387
01:22:40.140 --> 01:22:41.850
<v 4>could do something awesome.
Uh,</v>

1388
01:22:41.910 --> 01:22:45.690
I don't think people would accept the utopia that always find a reason to be

1389
01:22:45.691 --> 01:22:48.060
unhappy with it.
Always want to be the alpha.
Yeah.

1390
01:22:48.250 --> 01:22:52.510
That it was gonna be the Bill Gates boss.
$1 million.
Do you know how,

1391
01:22:52.511 --> 01:22:54.450
what $1 million it looks like?
Yeah.

1392
01:22:54.451 --> 01:22:59.250
There's an image of what $1 million looks like in stacks of hundreds would a

1393
01:22:59.251 --> 01:23:00.840
billion looks like and what a trillion.

1394
01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:06.130
A trillion is fucking a trillion is a lot a isn't,
you know,

1395
01:23:06.730 --> 01:23:09.250
it's not as much as you would think.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1396
01:23:09.580 --> 01:23:12.460
I've always wanted to do an episode about that and like actually work with a

1397
01:23:12.461 --> 01:23:14.530
bank and go to like the vault and say,

1398
01:23:14.531 --> 01:23:18.970
could I show people $1 million in hundreds and how it's,
I think it's,

1399
01:23:19.300 --> 01:23:23.550
I think that's just like five reams of paper towel.

1400
01:23:23.580 --> 01:23:28.150
Like that kind of stacks.
That's a million.
Well,
$10,000 is a small amount.

1401
01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:31.900
Yeah.
In hundred dollar bills,
it's not that much.
Right.
You know,

1402
01:23:31.930 --> 01:23:36.930
10 hundreds is 1,010 stacks of that is ten thousand ten thousand.

1403
01:23:37.271 --> 01:23:38.920
It's not that much.
It's not that much.

1404
01:23:39.150 --> 01:23:41.650
And so when you look at a million and stacks of hundreds,

1405
01:23:41.651 --> 01:23:45.220
it's a relatively small pile.
Yeah.
And a billion gets pretty big.

1406
01:23:45.221 --> 01:23:47.200
But a trillion is where shit gets really weird.

1407
01:23:47.530 --> 01:23:49.870
The thing about five reams of paper might be for dollar bills.

1408
01:23:49.871 --> 01:23:54.520
I didn't come prepared for all these little perspectives,
but yeah,
$1 million.

1409
01:23:55.060 --> 01:23:59.470
It's less less dollars than you would think in a,
in breaking bad.

1410
01:23:59.500 --> 01:24:04.060
The big pile of money.
That was insane.
Here's the,
here's the image.

1411
01:24:04.570 --> 01:24:09.400
This is a what it looks like.
Um,
what is that?
That small one.
A,

1412
01:24:09.410 --> 01:24:12.670
that's a million.
That's a million at small stacks and million.
I said a billion.

1413
01:24:12.700 --> 01:24:16.450
That's 100 million.
Wow.
1 billion.
That's a billion.

1414
01:24:16.451 --> 01:24:20.950
And here's a trillion car.
Poway and those are double stacks.
Yeah.

1415
01:24:22.060 --> 01:24:22.570
Yeah.

1416
01:24:22.570 --> 01:24:27.190
It's essentially a football field filled with cash and it's stacked up.

1417
01:24:27.220 --> 01:24:30.700
You know,
like Shaquille O'Neal.
Hi.
Yeah,

1418
01:24:32.530 --> 01:24:34.800
there's a lot of fucking money.
Have you ever seen those,
um,

1419
01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:37.270
images of those Mexican drug lords?
They bust,

1420
01:24:37.271 --> 01:24:40.180
they go to their house and they have like a whole room filled under dollars.

1421
01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:43.060
Yeah.
There's guys like didn't have banks,

1422
01:24:43.180 --> 01:24:46.780
they just have stacks and stacks of money and getting plated gun.

1423
01:24:46.781 --> 01:24:48.430
And often it's in multiple currencies.

1424
01:24:48.431 --> 01:24:53.431
They've got dollars and euros and in pounds and all because drugs are illegal.

1425
01:24:53.770 --> 01:24:58.180
Yeah,
yeah.
Forget.
Well,
you know,
it's really tough to like,

1426
01:24:59.020 --> 01:25:03.910
do I got really into money laundering during a breaking bad?

1427
01:25:03.911 --> 01:25:07.360
I like was obsessed with coming up with the best way to,
to,

1428
01:25:07.470 --> 01:25:12.130
to make money look legitimate.
What's the best way?
Well,

1429
01:25:13.030 --> 01:25:14.680
I feel like,
you know,

1430
01:25:14.681 --> 01:25:18.370
running something like a strip club is pretty good because the clients are

1431
01:25:18.371 --> 01:25:21.940
unlikely to really ever want to tell a lot about how much they spent and what

1432
01:25:21.941 --> 01:25:23.950
they spent it on.
So you could easily say,
yeah,

1433
01:25:23.951 --> 01:25:27.190
I made $1 million last year at my strip club.

1434
01:25:27.191 --> 01:25:30.210
Like I dare you to find the clients that,
that and,
and,

1435
01:25:30.211 --> 01:25:34.620
and account for all of this and cash in it.
And they would pay in cash.
Right,

1436
01:25:34.710 --> 01:25:38.590
right.
Um,
but also I was wondering what about just being like a life coach.

1437
01:25:38.830 --> 01:25:39.850
I could just say,
oh yeah,

1438
01:25:39.851 --> 01:25:43.480
someone paid me $1 million to teach them how to be happier.

1439
01:25:44.170 --> 01:25:49.060
Like you had that,
but that's a write off.
Someone paid you a million,

1440
01:25:49.740 --> 01:25:53.170
they would be able to write that off.
It's like educational expenses,
isn't it?

1441
01:25:53.710 --> 01:25:57.850
Coaching.
So,
so you're saying the strip clubs still a better way.

1442
01:25:57.851 --> 01:26:02.830
There's a batch of money.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Especially cause it's cash.

1443
01:26:03.500 --> 01:26:06.860
But then here's,
yeah,
you've,
you've got to get,
make that money.
Look clean.

1444
01:26:07.020 --> 01:26:11.060
Just keeping stacks of it in your house means that maybe you could totally go

1445
01:26:11.061 --> 01:26:15.860
for like nice dinners all the time,
but you can't buy a house very easily if,

1446
01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:17.900
if everyone just goes,
well,
how are you paying for this?

1447
01:26:18.140 --> 01:26:21.980
I have a room full of cash that I don't want a bank to know that I have.

1448
01:26:22.250 --> 01:26:25.370
Could you please do business with me?
It's tough.
Yeah.

1449
01:26:25.430 --> 01:26:26.100
<v 0>Well,
you know,</v>

1450
01:26:26.100 --> 01:26:31.100
we're running into this issue in Colorado with medical marijuana and then

1451
01:26:31.911 --> 01:26:36.800
becoming a recreational marijuana rather becoming a legal,

1452
01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:41.890
and then banks were not accepting the money from these.
Oh No.

1453
01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:45.140
Yeah.
And so they didn't,
they couldn't use credit cards.

1454
01:26:45.141 --> 01:26:46.370
They had to do everything in cash,

1455
01:26:46.610 --> 01:26:49.610
and then they would have to take that cash and they would have to take it when

1456
01:26:49.611 --> 01:26:52.370
it reaches a certain amount,
they would have to buy bank notes.

1457
01:26:52.760 --> 01:26:57.080
So I'd have to bring that money to the bank and cashing.
Yeah,
and exchange it.

1458
01:26:57.081 --> 01:26:59.690
So you have,
essentially,
you have these workers,
you know,

1459
01:26:59.691 --> 01:27:02.360
I don't know how much you're paying them per hour with a driving around with

1460
01:27:02.361 --> 01:27:04.100
insane amounts of money that's not safe.

1461
01:27:04.190 --> 01:27:07.270
It's very unsafe and very easily targeted.
Yeah.

1462
01:27:07.290 --> 01:27:12.170
I mean there's just giant medical marijuana take the money.
Well,

1463
01:27:12.171 --> 01:27:13.280
because the federal government,

1464
01:27:13.430 --> 01:27:18.290
the federal government is not allowing marijuana.
Not only that,

1465
01:27:18.291 --> 01:27:19.370
here's where it gets really tricky.

1466
01:27:19.371 --> 01:27:23.900
And this is important for anybody who's listening to this that lives in

1467
01:27:23.901 --> 01:27:27.620
Washington state or lives in Colorado,
where as a state,

1468
01:27:27.920 --> 01:27:31.490
marijuana is legal federally,
still not legal.

1469
01:27:31.491 --> 01:27:36.491
So if you go into a national park and you're in a national park and you smoke

1470
01:27:37.071 --> 01:27:39.770
Colorado or Colorado people getting arrested,

1471
01:27:40.310 --> 01:27:42.530
they're getting arrested by federal authorities.

1472
01:27:42.600 --> 01:27:46.740
<v 4>I should know more about this.
This is fascinating.
Yeah.
So the banks,</v>

1473
01:27:46.741 --> 01:27:49.800
because they're federally insured,
can well,

1474
01:27:49.830 --> 01:27:52.100
can't the bank just not ask where the money

1475
01:27:52.440 --> 01:27:56.850
<v 0>from?
I guess we tag the,</v>

1476
01:27:56.870 --> 01:27:58.620
no,
I think you have to.

1477
01:27:58.621 --> 01:28:01.170
I think you have to be able to report it because otherwise you're,

1478
01:28:01.171 --> 01:28:05.820
you're helping a binding drug dealers,
what they do in Florida and cocaine,

1479
01:28:06.060 --> 01:28:07.000
cocaine,
cowboys style.

1480
01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:10.050
That's a long time ago and that's a good question because they,

1481
01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:12.480
they did it illegally.
There's more,

1482
01:28:12.810 --> 01:28:17.810
there's more banks per capita in Florida than anywhere else in the world.

1483
01:28:18.390 --> 01:28:20.260
No kidding.
In Miami.
Yeah.

1484
01:28:20.700 --> 01:28:25.320
And they think that that is essentially because of the cocaine industry and that

1485
01:28:25.321 --> 01:28:26.940
Miami,
the cocaine cowboys,

1486
01:28:26.941 --> 01:28:30.510
which is a fantastic documentary by my friend Billy Corbin.

1487
01:28:30.511 --> 01:28:33.660
I've got to watch that.
Cowboys one and two.
It's great.

1488
01:28:33.840 --> 01:28:35.670
And we've been going back and forth on Twitter.

1489
01:28:35.671 --> 01:28:39.470
I've got to get that guy on the podcast because he's a really interesting guy on

1490
01:28:39.720 --> 01:28:43.530
his own and his documentaries are fantastic.
But cocaine cowboys is,

1491
01:28:43.590 --> 01:28:44.520
in my opinion,

1492
01:28:44.760 --> 01:28:49.760
the very best documentary ever on how crazy cocaine was in Miami at one time.

1493
01:28:51.690 --> 01:28:54.930
The entire graduating class of the police department.

1494
01:28:55.440 --> 01:28:58.860
They either wound up dead or in jail,
man,

1495
01:28:58.950 --> 01:29:02.160
like there was so much corruption.
Everyone

1496
01:29:02.190 --> 01:29:05.430
<v 1>was selling coke,
everyone was doing coke.
Everyone.</v>

1497
01:29:05.730 --> 01:29:10.730
The money was coming in in such insane piles and it was so unmanageable that

1498
01:29:11.551 --> 01:29:14.490
banks were popping up left and right to launder it.

1499
01:29:14.700 --> 01:29:19.700
People were just fucking coke dop and doing crazy shit like Scarface was really

1500
01:29:20.101 --> 01:29:24.030
sort of a minor version of what was really going on.

1501
01:29:25.410 --> 01:29:27.540
The reality was crazier than Tony Montana.

1502
01:29:27.570 --> 01:29:31.170
Tony Montana was very mild in comparison to the actual,

1503
01:29:31.410 --> 01:29:36.210
the actual dealings and craziness that was going on during the eighties the

1504
01:29:36.210 --> 01:29:39.900
cocaine days.
Wow.
It's amazing.
It's a fantastic documentary

1505
01:29:41.460 --> 01:29:45.720
and also all because of the fact that it was illegal.
I mean,

1506
01:29:45.721 --> 01:29:48.000
the same thing that's going on in Mexico right now,
I mean,

1507
01:29:48.001 --> 01:29:52.170
they kind of put the Kibosh on it in America or at least slowed it down

1508
01:29:52.171 --> 01:29:53.004
considerably,

1509
01:29:53.100 --> 01:29:58.100
but the reason why all this illegal violence was going on in the first place or

1510
01:29:58.260 --> 01:30:00.910
violence is going on in the first place was because it was illegal.
Yeah,

1511
01:30:01.050 --> 01:30:01.621
it was totally,

1512
01:30:01.621 --> 01:30:04.910
criminals could sell it and then they had to compete for dominance.
Right.

1513
01:30:04.970 --> 01:30:09.300
And you had no cash all around and houses and stuff.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1514
01:30:09.301 --> 01:30:10.440
This guy who was a pilot,

1515
01:30:10.700 --> 01:30:15.180
he used to have these a holes that he dug in his backyard and we'd put garbage

1516
01:30:15.181 --> 01:30:18.300
bags filled with like $1 million right in his backyard.

1517
01:30:18.301 --> 01:30:23.250
Most money cash you've ever held?
I haven't really held a lot.

1518
01:30:23.490 --> 01:30:25.850
Yeah,
I was thinking a couple thousand

1519
01:30:26.030 --> 01:30:27.100
<v 3>I think I've missed.
Yeah,</v>

1520
01:30:27.150 --> 01:30:31.560
I think 2000 I bought a couch with cash ones because there was like,

1521
01:30:31.910 --> 01:30:35.630
it was this weird deal that sounds so weird now,
but it was like,
well you know,

1522
01:30:35.631 --> 01:30:38.900
if you pay in cash it's like $200 less.
And I'm like,
really?

1523
01:30:39.170 --> 01:30:41.270
So I just went to the bank and I'm like,

1524
01:30:41.280 --> 01:30:43.640
I can I get 2000 cash or whatever it was.

1525
01:30:43.880 --> 01:30:46.460
And then they put it in an envelope and I walked back across the street and

1526
01:30:46.461 --> 01:30:47.690
bought the couch with the cash

1527
01:30:48.460 --> 01:30:51.160
<v 1>and that's because they have like credit card fees.
Like,</v>

1528
01:30:51.161 --> 01:30:56.161
I've had people ask me if I could pay with a visa instead of American Express

1529
01:30:56.860 --> 01:30:59.110
because American Express would give you like a higher fee.

1530
01:30:59.210 --> 01:31:04.010
<v 3>Ah,
yeah.
I've been to to uh,
like bars that don't accept American Express.</v>

1531
01:31:04.070 --> 01:31:07.820
Yeah.
Just purely because they hate the feed or something.
I don't know.

1532
01:31:07.821 --> 01:31:09.230
I'm not talking about anything.
I know anything.

1533
01:31:09.370 --> 01:31:13.240
<v 1>I think that's what it is.
Yeah.
Cause I,
I've,
I've,
I have seen that before.</v>

1534
01:31:13.241 --> 01:31:17.260
I've had people say to me,
is it,
do you have visa?
Like we take this,
if you don't,

1535
01:31:17.261 --> 01:31:19.990
it's okay.
I'm like,
well why don't you want it?
And then they'll tell you,
well,

1536
01:31:19.991 --> 01:31:23.830
they kill you with the fees.
I was like,
oh,
I didn't know that.
It varies

1537
01:31:25.390 --> 01:31:27.130
in American Express is always a weird one too,

1538
01:31:27.131 --> 01:31:30.790
because it was one where you paid it all off at the end of the month,

1539
01:31:31.030 --> 01:31:32.590
which I liked.
You know,

1540
01:31:32.740 --> 01:31:37.000
it wasn't like a visa card where say if you owe 1000 bucks,

1541
01:31:37.001 --> 01:31:40.900
you pay 10 a month.
It wasn't that.
It was like,
Yo,

1542
01:31:40.930 --> 01:31:43.240
if you spend 1000 bucks at the end of the month,
here's your bill.

1543
01:31:43.241 --> 01:31:47.230
It's 1000 bucks.
Which I like to just take care of that.
I don't,

1544
01:31:47.231 --> 01:31:48.910
I don't want that floating over.

1545
01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:52.840
I've been in debt before and it's a gross feeling to have this money just like

1546
01:31:52.841 --> 01:31:56.590
sitting over your head.
So the American Express thing,

1547
01:31:56.591 --> 01:31:58.000
I liked that you paid it off,

1548
01:31:58.001 --> 01:32:02.770
but I guess they charged more for that because otherwise why would it benefit

1549
01:32:02.771 --> 01:32:06.790
someone to pay in cash?
Like why would they want you to give them cash?

1550
01:32:07.310 --> 01:32:08.740
We can also involved.
Yeah.

1551
01:32:08.741 --> 01:32:12.910
Well with cash they could just pretend they wouldn't have to even pay tax on it.

1552
01:32:12.911 --> 01:32:15.850
They could just say,
and you're going illegal.
I'm not going illegal.

1553
01:32:16.180 --> 01:32:19.060
<v 3>You're trying to figure out the legitimate reason for it could have been the</v>

1554
01:32:19.061 --> 01:32:21.190
fees would have to be right.
Yeah.
Uh,

1555
01:32:21.750 --> 01:32:23.350
I'm going to forget all the details about this,

1556
01:32:23.351 --> 01:32:28.351
but I'm now remembering that I think I had $5,000 in my hand once because I was

1557
01:32:28.391 --> 01:32:33.310
investing this money in,
um,
a strip called Roth Ira.

1558
01:32:33.430 --> 01:32:36.160
Okay.
And I didn't have any checks with me.

1559
01:32:36.430 --> 01:32:39.430
I had checks in some other city and I'm like,

1560
01:32:39.431 --> 01:32:44.431
well how else am I going to give this $5,000 I so I got the cash and then turns

1561
01:32:44.771 --> 01:32:49.750
out you can't just show up at the cash to invest in the Roth Ira.

1562
01:32:49.870 --> 01:32:54.040
So I'm like,
ah,
okay.
Crutch hamp.
No,
they,
they,
they wouldn't even accept it.

1563
01:32:54.041 --> 01:32:55.460
And I was told by the,

1564
01:32:55.480 --> 01:32:59.170
the wealth management company that if you do that,

1565
01:32:59.270 --> 01:33:03.010
they don't want people coming in and out carrying lots of cash because that can

1566
01:33:03.011 --> 01:33:07.330
then cause like problems and outside where people know that people coming into

1567
01:33:07.331 --> 01:33:11.320
this business carrying lots of cash.
Huh.
So they wouldn't accept it.

1568
01:33:11.321 --> 01:33:13.540
So I had to just go and order more checks,

1569
01:33:13.720 --> 01:33:17.810
but I now I had $5,000 I had to put back in the bank.
Um,

1570
01:33:17.890 --> 01:33:19.240
and my mom did it for me.

1571
01:33:19.410 --> 01:33:22.450
This is what I'm not understanding why this story is so weird.

1572
01:33:22.451 --> 01:33:25.770
But she tried to do it in the bank,
flipped out and they were like,
well,

1573
01:33:25.771 --> 01:33:26.920
where did you get this money?

1574
01:33:27.040 --> 01:33:31.330
And she had to fill out a form and like tell them how she got it and what her

1575
01:33:31.331 --> 01:33:34.660
job was and why she had all this money in cash.

1576
01:33:35.370 --> 01:33:39.690
<v 1>Wow.
Yeah.
Bizarre.
We had a guy on recently,
um,</v>

1577
01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:41.030
who was a,
a,

1578
01:33:41.031 --> 01:33:44.670
a poker pro and he was talking about poker players who come back from other

1579
01:33:44.671 --> 01:33:46.950
countries and they win these poker tournaments.

1580
01:33:47.520 --> 01:33:51.750
Thousands of dollars and a lot of times it gets taken from them at the border

1581
01:33:52.290 --> 01:33:54.060
because they don't believe that they won this plan.

1582
01:33:54.100 --> 01:33:58.410
You have to prove that you right,
you've got $50,000 on you.
Oh yeah,
yeah.

1583
01:33:58.440 --> 01:34:01.290
You're a fucking drug dealer.
Like,
no,
I'm a professional poker player.

1584
01:34:01.291 --> 01:34:04.380
I won a tournament.
Here's my paperwork.
You,
Nope,
you've got to go to court.

1585
01:34:04.650 --> 01:34:07.170
And they would force them to go forward to try to get their money back.

1586
01:34:07.171 --> 01:34:09.190
They'd essentially steal their money and then make the,

1587
01:34:09.330 --> 01:34:13.230
but why would they have their poker winnings from a professional poker game in

1588
01:34:13.231 --> 01:34:16.530
cash?
Wouldn't you get it?
Well,
because you get it cashed out.
Like,

1589
01:34:16.531 --> 01:34:18.780
say if you're in Macau or something like that,

1590
01:34:19.670 --> 01:34:23.600
you win some gigantic poker.
Yeah.
You know thing?
Yeah.

1591
01:34:23.760 --> 01:34:27.480
You get your money and then you cash out cash in your chips.

1592
01:34:27.481 --> 01:34:31.290
They give you like in Vegas,
like I have a friend who's a degenerate gambler,

1593
01:34:31.770 --> 01:34:35.220
but he's also super wealthy.
So he,
uh,

1594
01:34:35.280 --> 01:34:39.040
he's Dana White.
He owns the UFC.
He's one of the owners of the UFC.

1595
01:34:39.240 --> 01:34:40.860
It's worth stupid amounts of money,

1596
01:34:41.160 --> 01:34:46.160
but he'll gamble and win $1 million in a night to hay and they give it to him in

1597
01:34:48.001 --> 01:34:52.020
garbage bags.
Like he has to go out to eat.
He goes out to his car,

1598
01:34:52.140 --> 01:34:56.070
they grab bags and they feel like $1 million.

1599
01:34:56.160 --> 01:35:00.860
They fill a garbage bag up with money and he'll leave with $1 million in cash in

1600
01:35:00.861 --> 01:35:04.430
a bag.
Oh,
he's talked about it many times talking about it on the podcast.

1601
01:35:04.760 --> 01:35:07.970
They would direct deposit it,
wouldn't they?
Nope.
Nope.

1602
01:35:08.030 --> 01:35:11.960
They give it to you in cash.
Wow.
I don't know if you want cash.

1603
01:35:11.961 --> 01:35:15.410
I don't know if they can direct deposit.
I'm not a gambler.
I don't understand.

1604
01:35:15.590 --> 01:35:16.520
I don't know any of this.

1605
01:35:16.521 --> 01:35:21.521
The most I've ever gambled on something is I think maybe a thousand dollars on

1606
01:35:22.461 --> 01:35:26.480
multiple bets.
Like before I used to be the commentator for the UFC.
Yeah.

1607
01:35:27.080 --> 01:35:31.280
I would bet on fights.
Okay.
And usually wasn't even the UFC,

1608
01:35:31.281 --> 01:35:32.690
it was like other organizations.

1609
01:35:32.691 --> 01:35:35.840
And I would go in and I kind of had an inside line.

1610
01:35:36.110 --> 01:35:40.580
Like there's still to this day I have a friend.
Um,
and uh,
I give him picks.

1611
01:35:40.670 --> 01:35:43.790
Like whenever the fights go,
like I go,
oh,
this is a lock,
this is a lock.

1612
01:35:43.791 --> 01:35:47.360
This is the bullshit of this.
These odds are idiots.
I don't know how this got in.

1613
01:35:47.540 --> 01:35:50.450
Like there's odds to this day that are really bad,
really.

1614
01:35:50.450 --> 01:35:53.480
Like you'll be guy who's a two to one favorite and you really should be a five

1615
01:35:53.481 --> 01:35:55.340
to one underdog happens all the time.

1616
01:35:55.550 --> 01:35:59.090
And it's because in order to understand mixed martial arts on a very,

1617
01:35:59.091 --> 01:36:03.710
very high level,
you have to have some competition.
You have to have competed,

1618
01:36:03.890 --> 01:36:04.790
you have to train,

1619
01:36:05.090 --> 01:36:07.910
you have to do it on a regular basis and you have to know the people.

1620
01:36:07.911 --> 01:36:09.170
And you have to know them inside and out.

1621
01:36:09.190 --> 01:36:12.260
You have to know what they're capable of.
If they're front runners,

1622
01:36:12.350 --> 01:36:16.430
there's certain people that will fold.
There's certain people that,
you know,

1623
01:36:16.460 --> 01:36:20.030
there's certain people that just have an intangible quality that they know how

1624
01:36:20.031 --> 01:36:22.940
to pull things off.
And that's how you sort of formulate the odds.

1625
01:36:23.090 --> 01:36:26.360
And a lot of times the odds makers are fat old white dudes who really don't know

1626
01:36:26.361 --> 01:36:29.870
what the fuck's going on.
They just know based on,
you know,

1627
01:36:29.871 --> 01:36:33.770
like this guy's more popular,
this guy's more famous or this guy,

1628
01:36:33.771 --> 01:36:35.670
he's beaten a lot of tough guys.

1629
01:36:35.671 --> 01:36:38.880
Like they don't know the other guy he's fighting.
Like,
um,

1630
01:36:38.930 --> 01:36:43.860
there's certain guys when they enter into the UFC for the first time,
um,
the,
the,

1631
01:36:43.910 --> 01:36:46.880
you know,
like a lot of people don't know how they did in other organizations.

1632
01:36:46.881 --> 01:36:49.820
That's when you can get sort of the best odds.
And so interesting,

1633
01:36:49.850 --> 01:36:54.680
this friend of mine,
I've given them these pigs,
we're like way over 80%,

1634
01:36:55.130 --> 01:36:59.930
like way over 80% winning.
So if I was,
if I was a real gambling man,

1635
01:36:59.960 --> 01:37:02.300
you know,
I'm not just cause I don't trust myself,

1636
01:37:02.720 --> 01:37:05.120
but if I was a real gambling man,
I would,
uh,

1637
01:37:05.121 --> 01:37:09.290
I'd be fucking killing them with that.
Yeah,
that's,
that's fascinating.

1638
01:37:09.291 --> 01:37:12.980
Who does get to set odds?
They have to be pretty smart,
but they're not,

1639
01:37:13.250 --> 01:37:16.190
they're not.
Some of them are,
some of them are smart,
you know,

1640
01:37:16.191 --> 01:37:18.260
I don't know who does it.
I don't know the people.

1641
01:37:18.261 --> 01:37:22.760
I used to know the guy who did it for USA Today,
um,
very smart guy.

1642
01:37:22.761 --> 01:37:26.030
And it was really interesting talking to him about odds.
But again,

1643
01:37:26.300 --> 01:37:30.350
an older guy didn't train,
you know,
didn't fight.
He was very knowledgeable.

1644
01:37:30.410 --> 01:37:34.040
But I think there's certain levels,
there's certain levels of understanding.

1645
01:37:34.310 --> 01:37:36.230
And then at the ultimate level of understanding,

1646
01:37:36.231 --> 01:37:39.530
like there's a certain guys who are like,
you know what,
if the shit hits the fan,

1647
01:37:39.560 --> 01:37:43.160
I think this guy folds up and you gotta you gotta take that into consideration

1648
01:37:43.161 --> 01:37:47.860
when he's fighting the guy who's not going to fold up.
But odds are very big.

1649
01:37:47.870 --> 01:37:52.130
Like,
I don't get,
how do you fucking make odds on a football game?

1650
01:37:52.380 --> 01:37:53.150
Like you're gonna,

1651
01:37:53.150 --> 01:37:58.140
you're gonna bet that these who like you have to follow injuries,

1652
01:37:58.141 --> 01:38:01.170
you have to make sure how's his ankle.
I heard that guy's going to bad ankle,

1653
01:38:01.171 --> 01:38:02.250
what's going on with his neck?

1654
01:38:02.251 --> 01:38:06.450
And this guy has got some new surgery for his fucking hip.
And um,
okay,

1655
01:38:06.451 --> 01:38:09.380
take that into consideration.
And this guy dropped the ball last week going,

1656
01:38:09.390 --> 01:38:10.310
we've got to factor that,
that,

1657
01:38:10.311 --> 01:38:14.250
and there's x amount of players on this team and y amount of players on that

1658
01:38:14.251 --> 01:38:18.420
team.
And they're all trying to move a ball across the line with all these random

1659
01:38:18.421 --> 01:38:21.780
variables.
It's not just who's going to win and who's going to lose,

1660
01:38:21.781 --> 01:38:24.360
but it's like by how many points.
Yeah.

1661
01:38:24.600 --> 01:38:28.280
And they're right so often know their rights.
So what my friend Joey Diaz,

1662
01:38:28.281 --> 01:38:30.750
as you never see a bookie with a part or the part time job.

1663
01:38:32.960 --> 01:38:33.793
<v 6>That's Joey.</v>

1664
01:38:35.380 --> 01:38:39.070
<v 1>Yeah,
the,
I don't get it.
But when you would think about it,</v>

1665
01:38:39.071 --> 01:38:42.340
like if people can understand the stock market,
which they sorta can,

1666
01:38:42.940 --> 01:38:44.980
and there's so much money involved in the stock market,

1667
01:38:45.400 --> 01:38:48.970
they would be able to figure out the variables involved in any sort of athletic

1668
01:38:48.971 --> 01:38:51.130
gambling too.
If there's money involved,

1669
01:38:51.131 --> 01:38:56.020
someone's going to try to do really well at it.
Uh,
like insurance is that way.

1670
01:38:56.150 --> 01:38:56.983
You know,

1671
01:38:57.340 --> 01:39:01.120
there's a bunch of people that are way smarter than you who were cranking away

1672
01:39:01.121 --> 01:39:05.830
at machines going,
what should we charge to make sure that we come out of this?

1673
01:39:05.860 --> 01:39:06.640
Well,
yeah.

1674
01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:11.470
And how do we fuck these people over when they do win or they do have a

1675
01:39:11.471 --> 01:39:13.780
legitimate claim,
how do we draw it out?

1676
01:39:13.781 --> 01:39:18.040
So we make as much money in interest during the time where we,
oh yeah.

1677
01:39:18.070 --> 01:39:21.150
While they're waiting.
Yeah.
I mean that's what they do.
That's why they,
I mean,

1678
01:39:21.400 --> 01:39:24.520
the more and the more they can get you to give up.
I mean,

1679
01:39:24.521 --> 01:39:28.150
some people just give up when faced with adversity,
faced with a challenge,
like,

1680
01:39:28.151 --> 01:39:31.030
you know,
you're gonna have to dispute this claim.
Ah,
fuck.

1681
01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:33.400
A lot of people just give up.
They just fold up shop.

1682
01:39:33.700 --> 01:39:36.130
Maybe they're just picking their battles.
Right.
They're like,
look,

1683
01:39:36.131 --> 01:39:39.100
it's not even worth it to me to fight this one.

1684
01:39:39.970 --> 01:39:42.370
I'm going to save that energy for something else.
Well,
there's,

1685
01:39:42.430 --> 01:39:44.380
there's definitely that.
And there's other people that go,
you know what?

1686
01:39:44.381 --> 01:39:48.790
I don't see,
I don't care if it's cost me $1 million to win 100,000.
Exactly.
Yeah.

1687
01:39:48.840 --> 01:39:50.350
There's a lot of people.
Those people are dangerous.

1688
01:39:50.620 --> 01:39:55.330
I had a great experience with the,
my,
my cell phone.
Uh,

1689
01:39:55.540 --> 01:39:58.540
it was,
it was a stolen I think.

1690
01:39:59.640 --> 01:40:01.890
<v 6>And uh,
uh,</v>

1691
01:40:02.150 --> 01:40:05.360
<v 1>yeah,
insurance fixed it all up.
I'm just got a new phone.
Really?
Yeah.</v>

1692
01:40:05.370 --> 01:40:07.610
Cause I mean,
I was paying for it though,
right?

1693
01:40:07.611 --> 01:40:09.710
I paid for like the best insurance,

1694
01:40:09.711 --> 01:40:12.830
like replacement policy and all I had to do is go in and say,
yeah,

1695
01:40:12.890 --> 01:40:16.400
this honestly was,
was stolen.
I,
you know,
I'm not lying to you check a box.

1696
01:40:16.401 --> 01:40:19.740
And then the next day they mailed me a brand new phone.
Well,

1697
01:40:19.741 --> 01:40:24.410
it's really crazy is people that have jewelry and they enjoy it.

1698
01:40:24.950 --> 01:40:29.950
I know a woman who lost a very expensive diamond ring and she filed an insurance

1699
01:40:33.051 --> 01:40:37.320
claim,
got paid and then found it in a jacket pocket.
So what do you do?

1700
01:40:37.730 --> 01:40:39.950
I don't know what she did.
I don't know her that well.

1701
01:40:40.130 --> 01:40:43.070
She was a friend of a friend but she apparent,

1702
01:40:43.300 --> 01:40:48.260
I hope she gave the money back cause if she gets caught she's like wealthy woman

1703
01:40:48.330 --> 01:40:52.010
right there.
She gets caught.
She's fucked.
Like they,
you know,

1704
01:40:52.040 --> 01:40:54.010
this was like $1,000

1705
01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:59.010
<v 4>ring or something crazy like that giant fat rock and she founded in her jacket</v>

1706
01:40:59.261 --> 01:41:01.510
pocket.
Like I think years later,

1707
01:41:02.410 --> 01:41:05.700
like she had made the claim and the whole deal and gotten paid.
Right.

1708
01:41:05.980 --> 01:41:10.420
She thought that some workers stolen.
Right.
Which definitely happened.

1709
01:41:10.421 --> 01:41:13.930
And then you find out that you,
you haven't actually committed fraud though,

1710
01:41:14.140 --> 01:41:14.770
right?

1711
01:41:14.770 --> 01:41:19.450
Unless you decide to not tell them right away that you found the ring and give

1712
01:41:19.451 --> 01:41:22.870
the money back.
But isn't it amazing that you could just do that?

1713
01:41:23.140 --> 01:41:25.780
You can just say,
someone stole my ring.
Yeah.

1714
01:41:25.870 --> 01:41:29.200
He can't prove who you file a police report and then you get the money.

1715
01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:32.650
And then you could just put the ring on and the darkness like fucking column.

1716
01:41:33.100 --> 01:41:37.420
Right,
right.
Well,
that's how I felt because this,
this phone,

1717
01:41:37.890 --> 01:41:42.190
uh,
I know where I left it and it was kind of in a public place and then it was

1718
01:41:42.191 --> 01:41:46.150
gone.
And I'm like,
ah,
I'm really sure I left it here.

1719
01:41:46.360 --> 01:41:50.050
I'm sure it was taken.
Why would someone take a phone though too?

1720
01:41:50.200 --> 01:41:52.190
Everyone's phone has a lock on it.
When you,

1721
01:41:52.200 --> 01:41:54.860
what are you going to do with that thing?
Cute.
Well,
I mean,

1722
01:41:54.870 --> 01:41:57.490
you can just like reset the whole thing.
Find my phone.
You know,

1723
01:41:57.491 --> 01:42:01.980
especially with iPhones.
Fucking mean people have been busted before.
Yeah.
That's,

1724
01:42:01.981 --> 01:42:03.010
that's happened many times.

1725
01:42:03.011 --> 01:42:07.330
And had a TSA worker got busted because they stole an iPad.
Yeah.
Good.

1726
01:42:07.331 --> 01:42:11.470
Fuck them fucking criminals.
And I took it.
Yeah.

1727
01:42:12.710 --> 01:42:15.310
And they found it and they went,
they traced it to the person's house.

1728
01:42:15.350 --> 01:42:17.470
I watched the episode where the guy's like,
yeah,

1729
01:42:17.471 --> 01:42:20.710
you know why there's an iPad in here?
And he's like,
what?
No,
it's my wife's.

1730
01:42:20.711 --> 01:42:25.660
And they're like,
well,
yeah.
No,
it's not.
That was really awkward.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1731
01:42:25.690 --> 01:42:29.830
Super Awkward.
Yeah.
Um,
how do they,

1732
01:42:30.250 --> 01:42:33.310
what do they do with android phones?
They have a similar,
yeah,
yeah.

1733
01:42:33.311 --> 01:42:37.210
They do like a find my phone feature.
Yeah.
Um,

1734
01:42:37.480 --> 01:42:40.300
and I've been using this thing called Google now,

1735
01:42:40.750 --> 01:42:45.750
which is a really pretty fun.

1736
01:42:46.250 --> 01:42:50.380
Uh,
I usually never update things.
I never allow things to know my location,

1737
01:42:50.381 --> 01:42:52.690
you know?
But this one I'm like,
I'm going to just see what it does.

1738
01:42:52.960 --> 01:42:56.260
And it was able to determine where I lived,
where my girlfriend lived.

1739
01:42:56.440 --> 01:42:58.600
It knows that I like,
like Taco Bell,

1740
01:42:58.720 --> 01:43:01.660
so it'll just tell me when I come to new cities,
it's like,
okay,

1741
01:43:01.661 --> 01:43:04.060
there's a Taco bell eight minutes away.
Uh,

1742
01:43:04.150 --> 01:43:05.890
here's the conversion between currency,

1743
01:43:05.891 --> 01:43:08.680
usually spend in the currency that they use where you are now,

1744
01:43:08.920 --> 01:43:11.830
here's some things that you might want to do based on where you're standing.

1745
01:43:11.860 --> 01:43:15.400
And I'm like,
whoa.
It's getting really squirrely with Google.

1746
01:43:16.420 --> 01:43:21.070
I love it.
I love it for convenience.
But man,
if you ever did something illegal,

1747
01:43:21.730 --> 01:43:25.660
like you're fucked by who?
I said,
if you ever did something illegal,

1748
01:43:25.770 --> 01:43:28.730
we wanted to track your whereabouts.
Like,
Oh,
you're not,

1749
01:43:28.830 --> 01:43:32.920
you mean it's all documented nuts that we are carrying around devices that tell

1750
01:43:32.921 --> 01:43:37.050
our locations in speeds or speeds.
Speeds.
Yeah.

1751
01:43:37.180 --> 01:43:41.140
If you're speeding permanent from your cell phone.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's a fact.

1752
01:43:41.350 --> 01:43:44.290
As you clip these different stations,

1753
01:43:44.291 --> 01:43:48.910
these different cell ports or whatever they are.
Channels.
Yeah.
Towers Towers.

1754
01:43:48.911 --> 01:43:51.320
Right.
Satellites.
Satellites.
Yeah.

1755
01:43:51.321 --> 01:43:55.100
Well cause you're that you're a gps is all satellite base so even if you have no

1756
01:43:55.101 --> 01:43:59.680
connection you can still use the gps to know your location.

1757
01:44:00.250 --> 01:44:02.390
That's true.
Yeah.
It used to be that

1758
01:44:02.690 --> 01:44:06.620
<v 0>ps,
was that on your phone?
Essentially?
It was.</v>

1759
01:44:07.250 --> 01:44:09.290
It doesn't usually calculating it from,

1760
01:44:09.320 --> 01:44:12.590
but it was calculating it from cell phone towers.
Now it's straight.

1761
01:44:12.600 --> 01:44:14.310
<v 4>I'm sure there's different ways that it works,</v>

1762
01:44:14.311 --> 01:44:18.090
but I know that like when I was in the,
the radio quiet zone in West Virginia,

1763
01:44:18.091 --> 01:44:23.091
there's no cell phone service but a satellite and gps worked.

1764
01:44:23.540 --> 01:44:24.040
Oh.

1765
01:44:24.040 --> 01:44:28.020
Because they're not talking with the same signals that are like band out there.

1766
01:44:28.080 --> 01:44:31.890
I said yeah,
the interfering with measurement times on the information.

1767
01:44:31.920 --> 01:44:36.900
Cause I know the old cell phones didn't work.
The GPS didn't work.

1768
01:44:37.050 --> 01:44:41.340
The navigation didn't work when you had no sir.
I think it can pull up.

1769
01:44:41.400 --> 01:44:43.770
You know where you are and how fast you're moving,

1770
01:44:43.771 --> 01:44:48.240
but you need the data plan to get the like images of the ground and the roads

1771
01:44:48.241 --> 01:44:52.500
and the where's the nearest thing that's all from data I think.

1772
01:44:52.560 --> 01:44:55.770
I mean it depends on what your plan is and what device you're using.

1773
01:44:55.771 --> 01:44:58.740
But this is going to come a time where you're not going to be able to drive.

1774
01:44:59.150 --> 01:45:01.500
It's coming really soon.
That's another Google thing.

1775
01:45:01.501 --> 01:45:04.910
These damn Google car self driving cars.
Well it's,
it's,

1776
01:45:04.950 --> 01:45:09.570
it's way safer right now.
Half the world take out all the fun.

1777
01:45:09.750 --> 01:45:13.020
I had a panic attack on the way here by the way.
Oh yeah.

1778
01:45:13.021 --> 01:45:17.850
I was driving and I just all of a sudden thought what if my site disappeared

1779
01:45:17.851 --> 01:45:18.684
immediately?

1780
01:45:21.020 --> 01:45:21.430
<v 0>That</v>

1781
01:45:21.430 --> 01:45:24.700
<v 4>and I was going so fast in this car that would be terrible.</v>

1782
01:45:25.030 --> 01:45:28.570
And that sort of freaking me out.
That's funny

1783
01:45:28.640 --> 01:45:31.100
<v 0>cause I had a similar dream recently.
It wasn't,</v>

1784
01:45:31.101 --> 01:45:34.430
what if my site disappeared is what if I had to navigate without sight.

1785
01:45:34.700 --> 01:45:37.940
And this is the strangest fucking dream and I can't believe I'm remembering
this,

1786
01:45:37.941 --> 01:45:41.750
but someone,
uh,
I don't know who the person was,

1787
01:45:42.200 --> 01:45:44.060
but they were very familiar to me.

1788
01:45:44.360 --> 01:45:49.270
They were driving by putting their,
their hand,
uh,

1789
01:45:49.280 --> 01:45:52.490
across their eyes and resting it on a mattress.

1790
01:45:52.520 --> 01:45:57.520
So they were driving from a mattress looking down like there was no visual

1791
01:45:57.681 --> 01:46:00.710
whatsoever.
And then they were steering with their,
and they were like,

1792
01:46:00.711 --> 01:46:02.060
you just got to go on your instincts.
I was like,

1793
01:46:02.061 --> 01:46:04.910
what the fuck are you talking about?
Like,
and they were,

1794
01:46:04.911 --> 01:46:09.800
they were moving a car from like,
without seeing where they were going at all.

1795
01:46:09.801 --> 01:46:11.210
I'm like,
how do you know where you're going?
Like,
well,

1796
01:46:11.211 --> 01:46:13.730
I know the path and I know how fast I'm going.
I'm like,
oh,

1797
01:46:13.731 --> 01:46:16.760
this is so fucking crazy.
And then I woke up,
it was one of those like,

1798
01:46:16.761 --> 01:46:18.830
this is just too much.
Uh,
I gotta wake up,

1799
01:46:19.110 --> 01:46:20.810
I woke up and for whatever reason I remember this.

1800
01:46:20.811 --> 01:46:25.310
But the idea of relying entirely on the sense of sight,

1801
01:46:25.850 --> 01:46:29.870
the c one sense that you use to determine where you are and where you're going.

1802
01:46:30.140 --> 01:46:34.910
And it was just the craziest thing to me that all this was being done without
it.

1803
01:46:35.270 --> 01:46:37.850
And I think of it as to in terms of submarines,

1804
01:46:38.430 --> 01:46:42.500
like submarines freaked me the fuck out because there's no windows and those

1805
01:46:42.501 --> 01:46:44.510
goddamn things,
it's just a metal tube.

1806
01:46:44.511 --> 01:46:49.511
It's relying on radar and you're in the ocean and you're fucking moving around

1807
01:46:50.280 --> 01:46:54.930
<v 4>like all this water pressure and there's rocks around and you have to rely on</v>

1808
01:46:54.931 --> 01:46:56.970
this radar.
And if the radar goes out,

1809
01:46:57.150 --> 01:47:02.150
you're piloting this huge tube through the ocean with no idea of what's around

1810
01:47:02.911 --> 01:47:06.330
you.
Yeah,
that's crazy.

1811
01:47:07.830 --> 01:47:09.540
Submarines are fucking crazy.

1812
01:47:09.870 --> 01:47:14.870
I mean that they figured out how to pilot things with sound and use radar waves

1813
01:47:16.260 --> 01:47:21.260
to figure out where objects are and sonar and that's just bizarre.

1814
01:47:22.830 --> 01:47:24.720
Yeah,
the it is.
And,
and the,

1815
01:47:24.721 --> 01:47:29.380
the suits that we built to like make that all possible or what inspired space

1816
01:47:29.381 --> 01:47:34.110
suits?
Um,
never been in a submarine.

1817
01:47:34.200 --> 01:47:38.950
How crazy is fucking James Cameron speaking about repairs.
Yeah,
go.
So Richard,

1818
01:47:38.960 --> 01:47:41.130
that's like your hobby.
Deepest depths of the earth.

1819
01:47:41.850 --> 01:47:44.070
He went to the deepest depths of the,
of the ocean.

1820
01:47:44.220 --> 01:47:47.930
He's like the first guy to like do the Mariana trench by himself.
Yeah.

1821
01:47:49.260 --> 01:47:50.220
Crazy fuck all.

1822
01:47:50.300 --> 01:47:55.300
All to make Avatar to supposedly it as an excuse to make Avatar to uh,

1823
01:47:57.300 --> 01:48:00.990
that's clever.
Well that's one of those,
he's one of those guys that were like,

1824
01:48:00.991 --> 01:48:05.280
what would you do if you had x amount of money?
Well that's what he would do.

1825
01:48:05.650 --> 01:48:08.520
And he's doing it.
Yeah.
I mean a lot of people would say like,

1826
01:48:08.521 --> 01:48:10.160
what would you do if you had,
you know,

1827
01:48:10.170 --> 01:48:14.250
fucking $50 billion and all the resources in the world and all these engineers

1828
01:48:14.251 --> 01:48:16.230
working for you and what would you do?
Well,

1829
01:48:16.231 --> 01:48:19.800
I'd probably devise the greatest submarine ever.

1830
01:48:19.950 --> 01:48:22.530
I was wondering what are the biggest wishes?

1831
01:48:23.010 --> 01:48:27.020
Like if you could just have one wish,
what would you wish for?
What has,

1832
01:48:27.030 --> 01:48:29.760
has anyone surveyed the population and been like,
well,

1833
01:48:29.761 --> 01:48:34.440
most people actually wished that they could fly or they wish for money or they

1834
01:48:34.441 --> 01:48:39.390
wish for x Ray Vision.
Like I want to see a list of the top 10 most wished,

1835
01:48:39.391 --> 01:48:43.170
wished,
wishes.
They would probably wish to have infinite wishes.

1836
01:48:43.740 --> 01:48:47.210
But isn't that like a trick like in that in a children's book?
Yeah.

1837
01:48:47.211 --> 01:48:50.250
You're not allowed to wish for more wishes.
That's always important.
Yeah.

1838
01:48:50.280 --> 01:48:54.120
That's the number one caveat.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You're allowed to,
uh,

1839
01:48:55.020 --> 01:48:59.970
what would you wish for if it was you?
Well,
great.

1840
01:48:59.971 --> 01:49:02.910
Now I'm having to answer this myself.
Yeah.
Why wouldn't you though?

1841
01:49:03.550 --> 01:49:06.550
If you're going to ask it,
why wouldn't you try to answer it yourself before you,

1842
01:49:06.950 --> 01:49:07.500
you know,

1843
01:49:07.500 --> 01:49:11.760
my answer should be that my wish is that there's complete peace on earth and

1844
01:49:11.761 --> 01:49:14.400
everyone's happy.
Right?

1845
01:49:16.030 --> 01:49:17.560
That's what we'd be.
Yeah.
But you know what,

1846
01:49:17.561 --> 01:49:19.330
that's the kind of wish that could easily,

1847
01:49:19.840 --> 01:49:22.510
you had to be careful what you wish for.
How long,
right.

1848
01:49:22.570 --> 01:49:24.640
For how long and also what does it mean that everyone's happy?

1849
01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:26.260
Is it that nothing changes,

1850
01:49:26.261 --> 01:49:29.770
but everyone's just has this contentness that won't go away.

1851
01:49:29.830 --> 01:49:34.090
Everyone's on Prozac.
Yeah.
It's,
everyone's got cysts.
S and then I'm like,

1852
01:49:34.091 --> 01:49:38.200
that's not what I meant.
But,
um,
I dunno.

1853
01:49:38.440 --> 01:49:41.110
I don't think flying would be that cool.
It'd be fun.
That kind of,

1854
01:49:41.111 --> 01:49:43.600
but it'd be too windy.
I'd have to build a suit.

1855
01:49:46.180 --> 01:49:48.580
Yeah.
The ability to teleport.

1856
01:49:48.940 --> 01:49:50.800
<v 0>Yes.
I want to be in New Zealand now.</v>

1857
01:49:50.880 --> 01:49:54.750
<v 3>Yeah.
I'm a New Zealand teleport.
Um,</v>

1858
01:49:56.370 --> 01:49:57.630
how many times would you be able to do it?

1859
01:49:57.660 --> 01:50:01.470
Would you be able to do it like blinking when you be able to do it as long as

1860
01:50:01.471 --> 01:50:03.300
you're alive?
Yeah.

1861
01:50:03.301 --> 01:50:07.110
And then also when you teleported would it still be you?
Right.

1862
01:50:07.160 --> 01:50:10.710
It's a huge question about teleportation.
It's like,
well,
wait,
if I,

1863
01:50:11.070 --> 01:50:15.540
if I assemble a bunch of Adam's somewhere else.
Exactly.
Replicate you.

1864
01:50:15.980 --> 01:50:17.100
Is that,
is that you?

1865
01:50:17.960 --> 01:50:21.590
<v 0>Well,
here's the real tricky one.
Um,
our memories,</v>

1866
01:50:21.740 --> 01:50:23.690
memories are always very strange,
right?

1867
01:50:23.691 --> 01:50:27.980
Our memories of just my memories of yesterday.
Yeah.
Here's a perfect example.

1868
01:50:27.981 --> 01:50:32.450
I had a great time yesterday.
I had a,
a really fun podcast.

1869
01:50:32.480 --> 01:50:36.020
Then I went and did two comedy shows at two different comedy clubs.

1870
01:50:36.021 --> 01:50:40.310
I drove around,
I hung out with my kids.
I had a great yesterday,

1871
01:50:40.340 --> 01:50:43.340
but my memory of it is quite sketchy.
I mean,

1872
01:50:43.341 --> 01:50:48.341
I can recall things in my head that I'm reasonably sure I did,

1873
01:50:49.460 --> 01:50:52.970
but it's pretty sketchy.
And then I went to sleep.

1874
01:50:53.240 --> 01:50:58.070
I shut off and I woke up and I woke up with the memory of this life.

1875
01:50:58.460 --> 01:51:02.000
And how do I even know that that's all the stuff that really happened?

1876
01:51:02.001 --> 01:51:04.790
How do I not know that I just started my life today?

1877
01:51:05.100 --> 01:51:06.780
<v 3>Yeah,
that's a great question.</v>

1878
01:51:07.040 --> 01:51:11.340
How can you prove that the universe didn't start 10 seconds ago?

1879
01:51:11.420 --> 01:51:14.410
<v 0>[inaudible] or your life didn't start getting seconds or,
yeah.</v>

1880
01:51:14.500 --> 01:51:18.480
Or the very least when you were rose,
when your consciousness,
I mean,

1881
01:51:18.481 --> 01:51:23.250
you know for sure,
reasonably sure that you were unconscious,

1882
01:51:23.310 --> 01:51:27.390
and then you became conscious this morning and when you became conscious this

1883
01:51:27.390 --> 01:51:30.360
morning,
you like,
where am I am in my bed?
Uh,
what time is it?

1884
01:51:30.361 --> 01:51:34.800
Let me check my phone.
What's today?
I think it's Wednesday.
Okay.

1885
01:51:34.801 --> 01:51:36.240
What do I do today?
Oh,
I've,

1886
01:51:36.241 --> 01:51:40.050
I'm Michael from vsauce is a Koan over is going to do a podcast that's going to

1887
01:51:40.051 --> 01:51:43.770
be cool.
Okay,
cool.
And I'm assuming based on my memory,

1888
01:51:44.070 --> 01:51:48.450
that this is the life that I've chosen and that this is the path that I'm on and

1889
01:51:48.451 --> 01:51:51.720
this is the events that are going to take place based on my iPhone calendar or

1890
01:51:51.721 --> 01:51:52.554
whatever.

1891
01:51:52.680 --> 01:51:57.420
But the reality is it's mostly just memory of a life that I've assumed.

1892
01:51:57.470 --> 01:51:59.670
<v 3>Yeah.
I lived at when I was a kid,</v>

1893
01:51:59.671 --> 01:52:04.110
I would freak myself out by just thinking about how I was trapped in my own

1894
01:52:04.111 --> 01:52:08.640
mind.
No one else was ever going to see out of my eyes.
No one else was me.

1895
01:52:09.210 --> 01:52:14.210
And it really made me feel lonely and trapped.

1896
01:52:15.420 --> 01:52:18.690
But isn't that of all the people I could have been seen out of,

1897
01:52:19.290 --> 01:52:21.270
out of all the mines,
I could have been on this one.

1898
01:52:22.490 --> 01:52:24.350
<v 0>That's a weird thing to freak out about.</v>

1899
01:52:24.410 --> 01:52:26.630
That's a very specific way to look at it.

1900
01:52:27.140 --> 01:52:30.800
That you're trapped in your own mind and you felt lonely because you were

1901
01:52:30.801 --> 01:52:33.890
trapped in your own mind.
I've never felt that.

1902
01:52:34.550 --> 01:52:34.931
<v 3>I've never,</v>

1903
01:52:34.931 --> 01:52:39.931
no one would ever look out of my eyes and be my head.

1904
01:52:43.550 --> 01:52:48.410
<v 0>Well maybe they will you the idea that we can record with a phone.</v>

1905
01:52:48.530 --> 01:52:52.190
Yeah.
You know,
you can record video and audio.
You could,
you could,

1906
01:52:52.280 --> 01:52:55.840
I could show you some stuff that happened yesterday.
Right?

1907
01:52:55.970 --> 01:52:59.390
This is a bird landed on my porch.
Look at,
I took a photo of,
yeah,

1908
01:52:59.570 --> 01:53:01.100
there's a video of it.
You can see the bird.

1909
01:53:01.130 --> 01:53:04.850
Oh there's the video that's sort of timed capture,
right.

1910
01:53:05.270 --> 01:53:06.890
Captured a moment in time.

1911
01:53:07.370 --> 01:53:10.550
There's gonna come a point in time where there's a much more sophisticated way

1912
01:53:10.551 --> 01:53:11.211
of doing that.

1913
01:53:11.211 --> 01:53:14.990
And I think it's going to be based on like some sort of a virtual reality oculus

1914
01:53:14.991 --> 01:53:17.900
rift type situation where we're going to have,

1915
01:53:18.500 --> 01:53:21.020
whether it'd be a Google Lens,
a contact lens,

1916
01:53:21.021 --> 01:53:25.250
or whether it be some sort of a neural implant that's able to accurately record

1917
01:53:25.670 --> 01:53:27.290
what you see and what you experience.

1918
01:53:27.290 --> 01:53:31.820
And then they're going to take it to the next level and the really advanced

1919
01:53:31.821 --> 01:53:35.840
versions of it.
We're going to be able to record a motions and touch and feeling.

1920
01:53:35.841 --> 01:53:37.460
And,
and your,
your own,

1921
01:53:37.550 --> 01:53:41.300
the battles that you have in your mind of perception,

1922
01:53:41.780 --> 01:53:43.070
the battles of a,

1923
01:53:43.100 --> 01:53:47.540
is this person being mean or are they just doing their job or how do I,

1924
01:53:47.600 --> 01:53:48.530
how do I go with this?

1925
01:53:48.740 --> 01:53:52.880
Is this traffic annoying or is it fascinating that there's all these cars,

1926
01:53:53.440 --> 01:53:54.350
you know,
what is,
you know,

1927
01:53:54.351 --> 01:53:58.010
what's my take on this and how do I choose to perceive the world?

1928
01:53:58.011 --> 01:53:59.790
Because that's a lot of what the world is,

1929
01:53:59.791 --> 01:54:04.430
is the choices that you make in perception.
It's not just the perception itself,

1930
01:54:04.460 --> 01:54:08.060
but how do you interpret that perception and what do you decide that it means?

1931
01:54:08.270 --> 01:54:09.920
Yeah.
And you know,

1932
01:54:09.921 --> 01:54:14.420
maybe you could like have insight as to why a person has fucked up like this.

1933
01:54:14.420 --> 01:54:16.910
There's some woe is me,
people that are really annoying.

1934
01:54:17.180 --> 01:54:20.720
Like everything is woe is me and there's always happens is bullshit.

1935
01:54:20.721 --> 01:54:25.070
And you know,
is it,
could you get in their head and could you find like,
oh,

1936
01:54:25.071 --> 01:54:29.840
you've got a hitch here,
right?
And how you look at stuff like you automatically,

1937
01:54:29.841 --> 01:54:30.051
you've,

1938
01:54:30.051 --> 01:54:33.620
you've developed a pattern where you automatically assume the world's out to get

1939
01:54:33.621 --> 01:54:37.280
you.
Yeah.
Like I know a dude and uh,
he's,

1940
01:54:37.370 --> 01:54:41.180
I wouldn't say he's smart because he's socially very dumb,

1941
01:54:41.570 --> 01:54:46.570
but he collects a lot of information and he believes that he's smart because he

1942
01:54:46.761 --> 01:54:51.761
collects a lot of information and collect information mean like he learns facts.

1943
01:54:52.370 --> 01:54:56.450
Well,
he runs a podcast and he's a,
he's a conspiracy theorist maximum.

1944
01:54:56.451 --> 01:55:00.260
Like he believes in chem trails and anyone who disagrees with them as an idiot,

1945
01:55:00.261 --> 01:55:04.190
he's super confrontational about it,
but he thinks that he's really bright.

1946
01:55:04.190 --> 01:55:06.770
But anybody who listens to his podcast,

1947
01:55:06.771 --> 01:55:09.500
who's objective could say there's something wrong with this guy.

1948
01:55:09.800 --> 01:55:14.290
Like he thinks everyone's a CIA disinformation agent.
And like,

1949
01:55:14.660 --> 01:55:16.910
it's really,
really bizarre when you listen to it.

1950
01:55:16.911 --> 01:55:21.911
Like he's accused me of being a disinflation agent for the CIA or the FBI or

1951
01:55:22.341 --> 01:55:26.450
you.
Not Anymore.
Oh,
okay.
It's just some fucking stupid,
but he,

1952
01:55:26.660 --> 01:55:27.860
in his mind,

1953
01:55:27.890 --> 01:55:32.030
he makes all these connections and he believes these conspiracies abound and

1954
01:55:32.031 --> 01:55:35.420
that they're everywhere.
And I would love to see what's wrong with his brain.

1955
01:55:35.660 --> 01:55:40.660
I would love to like go on like a schematic tour of the synapses,

1956
01:55:40.970 --> 01:55:45.490
how they fire and go,
Oh,
you've got Asperger's.
Oh you got it.

1957
01:55:45.540 --> 01:55:49.680
<v 1>Disease
conspiracies are fascinating.</v>

1958
01:55:49.710 --> 01:55:52.860
It's like you can't admit that just stuff happens.

1959
01:55:53.370 --> 01:55:55.320
It has to all be part of some plan.

1960
01:55:55.330 --> 01:55:59.220
It has to all be controlled by some like organization or person.

1961
01:55:59.430 --> 01:56:02.340
Well this is why,
because some of them are real.

1962
01:56:02.640 --> 01:56:04.980
This is why conspiracies are fascinating to people.

1963
01:56:05.010 --> 01:56:09.150
Like a lot of folks want to be in the no nonsense crowd and they want to say,

1964
01:56:09.151 --> 01:56:13.480
well,
you know,
spin spirits.
Either people can admit things just happen.

1965
01:56:13.860 --> 01:56:15.860
Okay,
but here's a good one.
Yeah.

1966
01:56:15.990 --> 01:56:19.800
Nine 11 do you think that nine 11 happened?

1967
01:56:20.430 --> 01:56:25.200
Meaning do you think that planes flew into towers and people died?

1968
01:56:25.260 --> 01:56:27.690
Do you think that that happened?
Yeah,
I do.
Okay.

1969
01:56:27.720 --> 01:56:30.800
Well then you believe in conspiracies because the,

1970
01:56:30.960 --> 01:56:35.010
what's the conspiracy that people can aspire to do that?
Ah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1971
01:56:35.180 --> 01:56:37.320
But it was very organized events.
Sure,
sure.

1972
01:56:37.321 --> 01:56:41.140
But I'm talking about the like things are being hidden from us.
Okay.

1973
01:56:41.220 --> 01:56:45.290
Do you believe that the government has tried to hide things from people?
Oh,

1974
01:56:45.300 --> 01:56:46.410
they have for sure.

1975
01:56:46.900 --> 01:56:51.610
<v 0>So then they're real and they advance those if of the events have actually taken</v>

1976
01:56:51.611 --> 01:56:55.300
place.
If events like,
like operation Northwoods,

1977
01:56:55.301 --> 01:56:57.810
you aware of operation Northwoods?
No.

1978
01:56:57.811 --> 01:57:00.580
It's one of the ones that conspiracy theorists love to point to because it's

1979
01:57:00.581 --> 01:57:05.140
pretty fascinating.
In 1962,
uh,
this was a,
uh,

1980
01:57:05.260 --> 01:57:09.940
this is signed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and operation Northwoods was a plan

1981
01:57:10.210 --> 01:57:14.290
to get the support of the American public for war against Cuba.

1982
01:57:14.650 --> 01:57:17.650
And what they were going to do is they were going to blow up a drone airliner.

1983
01:57:17.830 --> 01:57:19.000
They're going to blame it on cue.

1984
01:57:19.110 --> 01:57:23.610
<v 1>Ah,
yeah.
Arm.
If you heard this,
I think I'd read about false flag operations,</v>

1985
01:57:23.611 --> 01:57:25.050
all these things and I,
that one came up

1986
01:57:25.630 --> 01:57:30.630
<v 0>big ones because it was right around the time where we were considering going to</v>

1987
01:57:30.791 --> 01:57:35.791
war with Cuba because Cuba was allied with the Soviets and the whole deal and

1988
01:57:36.971 --> 01:57:41.440
they were going to arm Cuban friendlies and attack Guantanamo Bay and kill

1989
01:57:41.441 --> 01:57:43.960
American soldiers.
I mean this is a,

1990
01:57:44.210 --> 01:57:46.960
there was a whole series of events that they were planning.

1991
01:57:47.140 --> 01:57:50.710
This is all vetoed by Kennedy and it was a,
you know,

1992
01:57:50.950 --> 01:57:55.570
a real false flag plan.
And if you look at that,
you realize,

1993
01:57:55.571 --> 01:57:57.760
well that's how they think.

1994
01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.520
Like the people that were running the government at that point in time,

1995
01:58:00.521 --> 01:58:04.510
at least in 1962 there was a certain faction of them that thinks this way

1996
01:58:05.200 --> 01:58:09.550
everything evolves,
including evil.
Everything changes,
evolves,

1997
01:58:09.551 --> 01:58:14.050
becomes more complicated,
becomes more,
you know,
they,
they,
they,
they get better,

1998
01:58:14.051 --> 01:58:17.860
they innovate everything.
It's just the way things go.
Nothing,
nothing stays.

1999
01:58:17.860 --> 01:58:22.680
Still,
everything must elevate including its conspiracies.
Yeah.

2000
01:58:22.690 --> 01:58:24.010
I mean if,
if that's the case,

2001
01:58:24.020 --> 01:58:27.820
if operation Northwoods was really signed by the Joint Chiefs of staff and the

2002
01:58:27.821 --> 01:58:28.990
freedom of Information Act,

2003
01:58:29.350 --> 01:58:32.100
the documents that have been released show that it was right.

2004
01:58:32.320 --> 01:58:35.830
If that's the case and no one went to jail for that because no one did,

2005
01:58:35.860 --> 01:58:37.030
those are fucking criminals.
I mean,

2006
01:58:37.031 --> 01:58:42.031
those guys were planning on killing the children of Americans who went over and

2007
01:58:43.060 --> 01:58:43.480
we're,

2008
01:58:43.480 --> 01:58:47.560
we're working as soldiers believing that they were defending freedom and all

2009
01:58:47.561 --> 01:58:48.160
this jazz,

2010
01:58:48.160 --> 01:58:53.160
but they were going to be killed by other American soldiers or other American,

2011
01:58:53.440 --> 01:58:53.800
you know,

2012
01:58:53.800 --> 01:58:57.700
military people who are working in cahoots with the joint chiefs of Staff.

2013
01:58:57.730 --> 01:59:02.380
That's crazy.
It's a amazing,
yeah,
amazing fact.

2014
01:59:02.800 --> 01:59:07.000
So if that is true,
you,
you look at things like that and you've got to go,
okay,

2015
01:59:07.030 --> 01:59:09.640
well of course people believe in conspiracies.

2016
01:59:09.760 --> 01:59:14.380
If you don't believe in conspiracies,
I believe your infant tile,
I believe it's,

2017
01:59:14.381 --> 01:59:14.651
it's a,

2018
01:59:14.651 --> 01:59:18.700
it's a silly thing to think that the government doesn't conspire when you hear

2019
01:59:18.701 --> 01:59:23.080
that Dick Cheney and George Bush were considering a false flag attack,

2020
01:59:23.440 --> 01:59:24.640
uh,
on,
uh,

2021
01:59:24.670 --> 01:59:28.470
that they were going to say that Iran had attacked America.

2022
01:59:28.490 --> 01:59:31.120
This was something they had considered before they left office.

2023
01:59:31.750 --> 01:59:35.560
So the problem is that there are conspiracies,

2024
01:59:35.710 --> 01:59:38.920
but then there's another problem is that people see him in everything seem and

2025
01:59:38.921 --> 01:59:41.740
things and aren't conspiracy.
It's like you see chem trails,

2026
01:59:42.010 --> 01:59:45.730
they believe that con trails that are created when jet engines pass through

2027
01:59:45.731 --> 01:59:48.590
certain levels of condensation in the atmosphere is actually the government

2028
01:59:48.591 --> 01:59:52.630
spraying artificial clouds over.
Where does that idea begin?

2029
01:59:52.990 --> 01:59:56.920
The chem trail idea?
Yeah.
Begins with just,
well,
someone said like,

2030
01:59:56.950 --> 02:00:00.370
I feel different now than I did before airplanes flew over.

2031
02:00:00.370 --> 02:00:05.290
I wonder if the government created a chemical that makes us all obey them.

2032
02:00:05.800 --> 02:00:10.500
Have you ever seen prince talk about it?
No Way.
Prince,
the artists,
the musicians,

2033
02:00:10.510 --> 02:00:12.810
the artists was doing an interview.
Yeah.

2034
02:00:12.830 --> 02:00:16.480
And in the interview he was talking about chem trails and he was talking about

2035
02:00:16.481 --> 02:00:19.110
growing up and that you know,
he,
he,

2036
02:00:19.120 --> 02:00:23.080
when he was a kid he would see these trails in the sky and then all of a sudden

2037
02:00:23.081 --> 02:00:27.370
everyone would be fighting.
Everyone's fighting and I was like wondering,

2038
02:00:27.700 --> 02:00:30.610
they're spraying things is making everybody finding like,
Whoa,

2039
02:00:30.611 --> 02:00:35.590
what the fuck are you on prep day?
I don't know.
You'd have to ask him.

2040
02:00:36.040 --> 02:00:39.940
You'd have to ask him but it's,
see if we can find that.
It's you got it.
Okay.

2041
02:00:40.240 --> 02:00:44.950
We'll,
we'll pull it up because it's quite hilarious.
Like,
like first of all,

2042
02:00:44.980 --> 02:00:45.550
no one,

2043
02:00:45.550 --> 02:00:50.550
obviously he has formulated this incredibly complex theory that these people are

2044
02:00:51.731 --> 02:00:56.230
being quiet,
that thousands of pilots,
hundreds of pilots,
whatever,
engineers,

2045
02:00:56.350 --> 02:00:57.520
people that have armed the planes,

2046
02:00:57.580 --> 02:01:02.580
all of these people have formulated these methods of distributing some sort of a

2047
02:01:03.510 --> 02:01:08.510
unheard of chemical that can cause people to be aggressive and fight and only

2048
02:01:09.611 --> 02:01:11.980
target the hood.
You know,

2049
02:01:11.981 --> 02:01:16.480
you're 30,000 feet above it.
It's targeted,

2050
02:01:17.140 --> 02:01:22.140
but he's formulated this but made no attempt whatsoever to understand a is as

2051
02:01:23.530 --> 02:01:26.830
possible be.
Is there a disbursement way method of doing it?

2052
02:01:27.010 --> 02:01:30.160
See what are these trails that are in the sky?

2053
02:01:30.161 --> 02:01:33.680
What are these artificial clouds that everyone's so freaking out about?
Well,

2054
02:01:33.681 --> 02:01:36.790
they're not artificial clouds.
Their clouds that are created artificially.

2055
02:01:36.820 --> 02:01:40.070
That's all they are is clouds.
The reason why they look like clouds is because

2056
02:01:40.070 --> 02:01:42.640
<v 1>they are cleaning their water vapor at cloud.
Yeah.</v>

2057
02:01:42.650 --> 02:01:46.540
Jet Engine passes through condensation.
It changes because of the jet engine,

2058
02:01:46.560 --> 02:01:49.580
the heat of the,
of the engine that's spinning of the turbines.

2059
02:01:49.581 --> 02:01:50.414
The whole deal in it.

2060
02:01:50.540 --> 02:01:53.600
The reason why it looks like they're spraying clouds is cause they're making

2061
02:01:53.601 --> 02:01:56.720
clouds with the engine and it only occurs occasionally.

2062
02:01:56.930 --> 02:01:59.600
It only occurs when certain levels of condensation in the atmosphere.

2063
02:01:59.601 --> 02:02:04.190
This is all bright,
movable.
The point about the,
what's the simplest explanation?

2064
02:02:04.191 --> 02:02:06.260
That's the key thing.
I was like,
you know,

2065
02:02:06.261 --> 02:02:08.060
they could have also just puts stuff in the water.

2066
02:02:08.210 --> 02:02:12.470
Like why does it have to be such an elaborate conspiracy?

2067
02:02:12.500 --> 02:02:13.880
Because they see it.
Yeah.

2068
02:02:13.910 --> 02:02:18.910
Mick West who runs debunked.com metal bunk rather.

2069
02:02:19.220 --> 02:02:23.320
Um,
he's a former software guy,

2070
02:02:24.050 --> 02:02:29.050
made video games and he became fascinated by debunking like a really complex

2071
02:02:30.531 --> 02:02:31.370
things like this.

2072
02:02:31.371 --> 02:02:34.910
Like we're where people have all these like psychological connections to these

2073
02:02:34.911 --> 02:02:39.050
things and he calls it the training wheels of conspiracy theories because you

2074
02:02:39.051 --> 02:02:42.900
see them,
you see like what is that?
They sprang things.
What is that?
Like?

2075
02:02:43.060 --> 02:02:45.320
It's just a to Ed.
Like God dammit.

2076
02:02:45.440 --> 02:02:49.610
But nobody wants to look into it deep enough to,
you know,

2077
02:02:49.611 --> 02:02:51.440
to sort of debunk the whole thing.

2078
02:02:51.441 --> 02:02:56.441
But yet prince will go on television and have this really detailed idea that he

2079
02:02:56.841 --> 02:02:59.090
has in his head.
Well here we'll play it.
Yeah.
Cause he's,

2080
02:02:59.390 --> 02:03:02.090
it's quiet cause he's still in the back of my head.

2081
02:03:02.120 --> 02:03:04.290
I can't get him out of my buy head.
Where this conversation is.

2082
02:03:04.370 --> 02:03:06.050
<v 7>I'm sorry.
Um,</v>

2083
02:03:07.670 --> 02:03:12.670
who have you felt most often like in the ring fighting the record industry?

2084
02:03:14.140 --> 02:03:18.690
Like Jack or the opponent?
Oh,
like Jack,
like Jack.

2085
02:03:20.240 --> 02:03:23.450
Well,
because I knew I was right.
You know,

2086
02:03:23.451 --> 02:03:27.800
we talked about this in our very first interview and conversation together.

2087
02:03:28.140 --> 02:03:28.973
Um,

2088
02:03:29.900 --> 02:03:33.890
it's obvious now that artists are supposed to own their master recordings.

2089
02:03:34.160 --> 02:03:34.431
I mean,

2090
02:03:34.431 --> 02:03:38.240
in the future it'll be unconscionable to even think you can take somebodies

2091
02:03:39.110 --> 02:03:42.860
creation and claim ownership of it.
See,
unfortunately,

2092
02:03:43.160 --> 02:03:47.330
this discussion is going to start to barrel into a discussion about the human

2093
02:03:47.331 --> 02:03:51.770
genome and the DNA and all the rest of it.
Um,
when it gets there,

2094
02:03:51.771 --> 02:03:55.730
then we're going to be in deep water.
See?

2095
02:03:55.731 --> 02:04:00.731
So it's better to start the conversation now before we get into God talk,

2096
02:04:02.420 --> 02:04:03.253
you know,

2097
02:04:04.460 --> 02:04:06.170
<v 1>um,
you show this is the right video.</v>

2098
02:04:06.560 --> 02:04:10.340
There are four songs and I want to ask you about,

2099
02:04:10.820 --> 02:04:12.470
and I did what I have never done before,

2100
02:04:12.471 --> 02:04:14.410
which is to actually print these lyrics out.

2101
02:04:14.810 --> 02:04:16.910
Some of them just to record is so new.

2102
02:04:16.911 --> 02:04:19.370
I'm learning some of them I got just skipping ahead a little bit.

2103
02:04:19.710 --> 02:04:20.910
Some of the fucking list

2104
02:04:21.130 --> 02:04:23.670
<v 7>more about all of us because,
um,</v>

2105
02:04:24.640 --> 02:04:26.920
what he said affects all of them.

2106
02:04:27.270 --> 02:04:32.230
He said online or wherever and try to get a copy of it and just listen to it.

2107
02:04:32.380 --> 02:04:36.330
<v 1>Okay.
You're going to listen to this before.
This is not the right shit,
right?</v>

2108
02:04:37.230 --> 02:04:38.130
Find the right shit whale.

2109
02:04:38.700 --> 02:04:40.110
<v 0>Um,
the,
um,</v>

2110
02:04:40.140 --> 02:04:45.140
there is a video is that video and it is in that conversation that talks about

2111
02:04:45.811 --> 02:04:50.240
Kim trail,
but I see what he said that like,
you know,
the genome and the DNA,

2112
02:04:50.510 --> 02:04:55.510
like people will throw around big words like fascinating scientific terms like

2113
02:04:56.221 --> 02:05:00.210
that when they're talking about really ridiculous shit and you go,
okay,

2114
02:05:00.211 --> 02:05:00.840
well you've,

2115
02:05:00.840 --> 02:05:05.840
you've researched enough that you understand that there's a thing called DNA and

2116
02:05:05.870 --> 02:05:10.870
there's a thing called the human genome is very complex program that has been

2117
02:05:11.611 --> 02:05:14.640
devised to understand the,
the ingredients,

2118
02:05:14.641 --> 02:05:17.220
the very components of human life,

2119
02:05:17.610 --> 02:05:22.610
but yet you haven't looked at all into this whole plane spraying fake clouds

2120
02:05:25.411 --> 02:05:27.870
thing.
Yeah.
Enough to understand that.
First of all,

2121
02:05:27.900 --> 02:05:30.210
they think it's like aluminum and Barium.
Well,

2122
02:05:30.211 --> 02:05:33.510
aluminum and Barium doesn't look like water vapor.
Do you understand that?

2123
02:05:33.890 --> 02:05:37.530
Like if they were spraying aluminum and me saying this right now,

2124
02:05:37.590 --> 02:05:42.590
I will be accused of being a disinfect paid this information age just because I

2125
02:05:42.751 --> 02:05:45.390
simply,
I believe there are real conspiracies.

2126
02:05:45.390 --> 02:05:49.890
I believe there's a real threat to security,
peace,
prosperity in this world,

2127
02:05:50.250 --> 02:05:53.610
but it's not planes making fake clouds.
You know?

2128
02:05:53.700 --> 02:05:58.700
And if people really want to look at chem trails and the dangers of these jets,

2129
02:05:59.160 --> 02:06:02.760
look at all the instances of diseases where people live close to airports.

2130
02:06:02.970 --> 02:06:04.140
That's the real issue.

2131
02:06:04.410 --> 02:06:07.800
The real issue when it comes to air travel is the fact that this is not a free

2132
02:06:07.801 --> 02:06:10.770
ride.
No one rides for free in any way,
shape or form.

2133
02:06:10.920 --> 02:06:13.790
And when you're burning propellant and that it,

2134
02:06:13.850 --> 02:06:15.870
it gets dispersed through the atmosphere.

2135
02:06:15.990 --> 02:06:18.330
The people that are on the ground there breathing that shit.

2136
02:06:18.390 --> 02:06:21.000
And if you breathe that shit,
that's the real danger there.

2137
02:06:21.040 --> 02:06:24.390
The real concern is not these artificial clouds.

2138
02:06:24.570 --> 02:06:29.570
The real concern is the fact that you're burning fuel in the sky at a rate of

2139
02:06:29.820 --> 02:06:33.890
thousands and thousands of flights a day.
Yeah,

2140
02:06:34.710 --> 02:06:35.780
that's what's going on there.

2141
02:06:35.781 --> 02:06:40.781
There's a direct correlation between lung diseases and instances of asthma and

2142
02:06:41.251 --> 02:06:45.720
all directly related to people living close to airports.
I mean that's,

2143
02:06:45.721 --> 02:06:48.780
that's the real chem trails.
I mean that's real.

2144
02:06:48.781 --> 02:06:53.130
There's really are burning fuel and it's just pollution and it's not a special

2145
02:06:53.131 --> 02:06:55.170
chemical designed by the government.

2146
02:06:55.800 --> 02:06:58.980
Who was the government like I got like five guys all in a room where like don't

2147
02:06:58.981 --> 02:07:03.270
tell the rest of the reptile people that don't tell the rest of the planet,

2148
02:07:03.570 --> 02:07:07.230
but we've created a chemical that will make people want to fight because did you

2149
02:07:07.231 --> 02:07:11.790
find the Jamie?
Okay,
here it goes.
This is a,

2150
02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:15.180
this is one of my most favorite clips,

2151
02:07:16.310 --> 02:07:18.590
<v 7>phenomena of chem trails.</v>

2152
02:07:19.550 --> 02:07:22.880
And you know,
when I was a kid,

2153
02:07:22.881 --> 02:07:26.720
I used to see these trails in the sky all the time.

2154
02:07:26.721 --> 02:07:28.670
And so that's cool.

2155
02:07:28.900 --> 02:07:32.870
A jet just went over and then you started to see a whole bunch of,

2156
02:07:33.860 --> 02:07:37.420
and next thing you know in your neighborhood was fighting and arguing.

2157
02:07:37.421 --> 02:07:42.100
And you did know why.
Okay.
And,
and you really didn't know why.

2158
02:07:42.190 --> 02:07:45.850
I mean everybody was fighting.
So he,

2159
02:07:46.600 --> 02:07:51.600
he started riffing about the chem trails and

2160
02:07:53.620 --> 02:07:58.270
he started to say things that,
uh,
hit home so hard.

2161
02:07:58.540 --> 02:08:03.540
And I would recommend that everybody try to get what he said online or wherever

2162
02:08:06.610 --> 02:08:10.530
and try to get a copy of it and just listen to it because the uh,

2163
02:08:10.690 --> 02:08:12.670
I was so moved that I had to write the song.

2164
02:08:13.990 --> 02:08:18.040
<v 0>Are you write about Kim Jones?
First of all,
if,</v>

2165
02:08:19.190 --> 02:08:23.870
if,
if that hits home move.
Okay.

2166
02:08:24.110 --> 02:08:28.200
If that's,
if that hits home,
these chem trail,
these,

2167
02:08:28.310 --> 02:08:29.930
these planes are making people fight,

2168
02:08:30.110 --> 02:08:33.470
you need to move to a new home because your home is retarded.

2169
02:08:34.130 --> 02:08:37.340
I want to hear this song.
I don't want to hear the song.

2170
02:08:37.400 --> 02:08:40.700
I love Prince and he's got some great songs but he's a complex dude,

2171
02:08:40.701 --> 02:08:44.510
was filled with emotions and not a lot of critical thinking when it comes to

2172
02:08:44.511 --> 02:08:46.340
things like this.
You know,

2173
02:08:46.490 --> 02:08:50.620
the idea that somebody told him some nonsense and now you know,

2174
02:08:51.110 --> 02:08:54.110
in his defense pre-internet,

2175
02:08:54.111 --> 02:08:56.510
that was a lot of the ways that information was shared.
I mean,

2176
02:08:56.511 --> 02:08:58.940
how many conversations were happening?
Dude,

2177
02:08:58.941 --> 02:09:01.760
did you hear that the government is doing this thing and some of them,

2178
02:09:02.750 --> 02:09:06.380
some of them are so ridiculous,
they seem to like conspiracies.

2179
02:09:06.381 --> 02:09:09.470
But our real like the gay bomb.
Did you ever hear about the gay bomb?

2180
02:09:10.340 --> 02:09:12.080
I've heard things like it.
Yeah.

2181
02:09:12.250 --> 02:09:16.070
You got the government actively tried to figure out a way to make a bomb where

2182
02:09:16.071 --> 02:09:19.760
they could ignite it in the air or blow it up in the air,
detonate it rather.

2183
02:09:19.970 --> 02:09:23.090
And it would cause everyone on the ground to fall in love with each other and

2184
02:09:23.091 --> 02:09:25.100
write gay and that they would lose the will to fight.

2185
02:09:25.170 --> 02:09:29.940
<v 3>Right?
Yeah.
That was like a real plant.
But yeah,
before,
before the,</v>

2186
02:09:29.941 --> 02:09:33.150
um,
the internet and like mobile phones,

2187
02:09:33.151 --> 02:09:37.470
you couldn't easily just like fact check stuff people told you.
So urban legends,

2188
02:09:37.471 --> 02:09:42.300
I think we're way easier to spread.
They still spread.
They still spread.
But,

2189
02:09:42.600 --> 02:09:46.020
but it's like if you would just bother to look it up,
easily find it.

2190
02:09:46.021 --> 02:09:48.320
That's not true.
But when I was a kid,
the,

2191
02:09:48.430 --> 02:09:52.350
the thing with the girl in the hot dogs and that,
well it did happen.

2192
02:09:52.351 --> 02:09:56.450
It happened right here.
I'm just coming out when the story is this.
It's a little,

2193
02:09:56.460 --> 02:10:01.200
it's a little graphic,
but please a girl gets it,
gets a hot dog stuck insider.

2194
02:10:01.620 --> 02:10:02.453
And

2195
02:10:04.050 --> 02:10:08.610
it wasn't until I grew up that I started talking from people with people who

2196
02:10:08.611 --> 02:10:12.600
grew up in different cities and they all knew the same story about this girl.

2197
02:10:12.601 --> 02:10:16.230
And it's like,
wait a second,
right.
This never happened.

2198
02:10:16.260 --> 02:10:18.000
Or maybe it has happened,

2199
02:10:18.001 --> 02:10:21.000
but this wasn't something that happened in our Mike Unity.

2200
02:10:21.330 --> 02:10:26.010
<v 0>Yeah.
Well that's a story when,
when someone ever,
when someone creates like,</v>

2201
02:10:26.070 --> 02:10:29.610
uh,
like even something that really have,
like I had a buddy who,
um,

2202
02:10:29.790 --> 02:10:33.320
he's an ophthalmologist and he did his residency in Miami during the cocaine

2203
02:10:33.330 --> 02:10:34.840
years and uh,

2204
02:10:35.480 --> 02:10:39.860
he dealt with a lot of really crazy stuff.
Like he saw sure.

2205
02:10:39.950 --> 02:10:41.500
Gunshot wounds and all,

2206
02:10:41.540 --> 02:10:46.540
but he said by far the craziest things that were the most like,

2207
02:10:46.671 --> 02:10:50.700
wait,
what?
Where people with things stuck up their ass.
Yeah.

2208
02:10:50.780 --> 02:10:53.840
And he said like everything you can imagine,

2209
02:10:53.910 --> 02:10:57.350
electric toothbrushes,
light bulbs,

2210
02:10:57.470 --> 02:11:01.100
like they pulled out of people's asses.
Like,
if you can imagine it,

2211
02:11:01.101 --> 02:11:05.900
like the urban legends pale in comparison to the actual truth of fit pistols.

2212
02:11:05.901 --> 02:11:08.810
They found a pistol that was stopped at this guy's ass.
Yeah.

2213
02:11:08.811 --> 02:11:12.080
They stuffed a fucking 38 caliber pistol in his ass.

2214
02:11:12.870 --> 02:11:16.640
If you think about fisting,
someone can fist yeah,
if you can fit that and your,

2215
02:11:16.641 --> 02:11:19.850
but you can fit a lot of stuff.
You could fit a gun.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2216
02:11:20.420 --> 02:11:23.660
And did he do that for fun or was it a punishment or is he trying to like sneak

2217
02:11:23.661 --> 02:11:26.930
the gun?
A good question.
I don't think he's going to be honest.
Yeah.

2218
02:11:27.230 --> 02:11:29.600
Why do you have a pistol up your ass?
Well,
the government is paying,

2219
02:11:29.990 --> 02:11:32.720
it was on my ass.
I don't know.
You know,

2220
02:11:32.740 --> 02:11:37.400
but the reality of pistols in your ass that mean that that's as bout as bizarre

2221
02:11:37.401 --> 02:11:40.610
as that durable,
rich Richard Gere German.
I remember that.
Right?

2222
02:11:41.020 --> 02:11:45.480
<v 3>Yeah.
But when I first heard that story,
I had no way of confirming or denying it.</v>

2223
02:11:45.510 --> 02:11:47.790
I,
it was just a story.

2224
02:11:47.860 --> 02:11:51.070
<v 0>Well,
I can give you a story on that story.
I don't know if this is true,</v>

2225
02:11:51.071 --> 02:11:54.850
but what I had heard was that this was when Richard Gere had left Scientology

2226
02:11:55.120 --> 02:11:57.900
and that one of the ways they got back at him was treating this.

2227
02:11:58.090 --> 02:12:01.650
How do you release that story though?
I don't know,
but my friends to know,

2228
02:12:01.700 --> 02:12:03.790
I would like to know too.
It might not even be true,

2229
02:12:03.791 --> 02:12:08.791
but my friend Eddie grew up in La and I grew up in Boston and we met when we

2230
02:12:09.161 --> 02:12:14.161
were both in our like 30 years and we had both heard the same rumor growing up.

2231
02:12:15.430 --> 02:12:19.780
So somehow or another that's it.
Yeah.
Numer got across the continent.

2232
02:12:20.270 --> 02:12:22.690
<v 3>That's what I'm saying.
I heard these rumors,
like I,
I,</v>

2233
02:12:22.810 --> 02:12:27.740
I had friends who told me a story about a famous,

2234
02:12:27.741 --> 02:12:32.741
a fried chicken place in Chicago and this woman like goes up there and orders a

2235
02:12:32.991 --> 02:12:37.670
bunch of food,
like a lot like,
like eight chickens.
Right.

2236
02:12:37.850 --> 02:12:41.720
And,
and there's this funny conversation that they have a,

2237
02:12:41.721 --> 02:12:44.450
and it ends with the woman going,
you don't know my life.

2238
02:12:44.630 --> 02:12:46.310
And everyone told this like,
you know,

2239
02:12:46.520 --> 02:12:49.910
I was told that this happened in this like restaurant.

2240
02:12:50.870 --> 02:12:54.320
Four years later I'm driving around with his person who grew up in New York.

2241
02:12:54.560 --> 02:12:58.850
She tells me the same story and I'm like,
what is this?

2242
02:12:58.851 --> 02:13:03.590
Just one of those things where everyone has a friend who saw this happen.

2243
02:13:03.690 --> 02:13:04.523
<v 0>Right?</v>

2244
02:13:05.100 --> 02:13:10.100
Which is really strange when you stop and think about the length of time between

2245
02:13:11.100 --> 02:13:16.100
religious stories being told over campfires and through oral traditions and them

2246
02:13:18.090 --> 02:13:21.610
actually being written down somewhere.
Yeah.
Ha.

2247
02:13:21.940 --> 02:13:24.760
<v 3>Because if that story about the woman at the chicken restaurant,</v>

2248
02:13:24.761 --> 02:13:26.830
which I didn't even tell very well,
but it's not even very funny,

2249
02:13:26.831 --> 02:13:30.150
but it's just that story was accepted as fact.
Yeah.

2250
02:13:30.900 --> 02:13:34.560
A specific fact that occurred at a specific restaurant and then I realized that

2251
02:13:34.561 --> 02:13:38.250
it's just everyone has a friend who had this experience.

2252
02:13:38.750 --> 02:13:41.690
<v 0>Well,
Hawaii is incredibly fascinating to me.</v>

2253
02:13:41.880 --> 02:13:46.880
A one because it's just so beautiful and two because it's a volcano that sort of

2254
02:13:47.091 --> 02:13:50.780
popped out of the middle of the Pacific Ocean,
the most remote spot on earth,

2255
02:13:50.781 --> 02:13:54.590
in fact,
so remote.
It's incredible.
I love it.
It's my favorite place to visit.

2256
02:13:54.591 --> 02:13:58.910
But when I was there,
I was talking to this guy.
I went on this fishing trip and,

2257
02:13:58.911 --> 02:13:59.960
uh,
the guy who was the,

2258
02:14:00.530 --> 02:14:05.330
the captain a boat really cool guy was telling me about,
uh,
he,
he,
uh,

2259
02:14:05.390 --> 02:14:10.310
actually grew up in California and then made its way out to Hawaiian,

2260
02:14:10.311 --> 02:14:11.150
decided to stay there.

2261
02:14:11.300 --> 02:14:14.830
And we were talking about the local traditions and the local,
uh,
the,

2262
02:14:14.831 --> 02:14:19.010
the folk lore involving like how the islands were formed,

2263
02:14:19.011 --> 02:14:23.990
how the stars were formed and all their stuff was like in songs.
And,
you know,

2264
02:14:24.560 --> 02:14:29.030
their whole history was just oral tradition.
I mean,
it's a,
it's a people,

2265
02:14:29.240 --> 02:14:31.670
you know,
the Polynesian people settled in Hawaii,

2266
02:14:31.671 --> 02:14:36.530
first of people whose entire history was this,
the,
these very,

2267
02:14:36.531 --> 02:14:39.530
very important stories that they told to each other,

2268
02:14:39.710 --> 02:14:41.390
but they never really wrote them down.

2269
02:14:42.840 --> 02:14:44.610
<v 3>Yeah.
Incredible.
Yeah.</v>

2270
02:14:45.570 --> 02:14:48.570
<v 0>And like the stars were sewn together by the God.
Right.</v>

2271
02:14:48.710 --> 02:14:53.280
<v 4>And the maps they came up with were really,
really cool.
Yeah.
Um,</v>

2272
02:14:55.170 --> 02:14:58.290
<v 3>I was just talking to someone about how the,</v>

2273
02:14:58.320 --> 02:15:03.120
the native New Zealanders put south up in their maps.

2274
02:15:03.490 --> 02:15:06.150
Hmm.
Right.
Not North.
And so if you,

2275
02:15:06.151 --> 02:15:08.130
if you actually look at New Zealand upside down,

2276
02:15:08.131 --> 02:15:12.000
it looks like a fish and all this kind of thing.
Uh,
and that's,

2277
02:15:12.030 --> 02:15:13.620
that's what they thought their land was.

2278
02:15:13.621 --> 02:15:17.110
It was this fish that was coming out of a boat or whatever it is.
Um,

2279
02:15:17.140 --> 02:15:20.370
and then we came and said,
no,
no,
no north the other way.

2280
02:15:21.120 --> 02:15:22.050
It doesn't look like a fish.

2281
02:15:22.800 --> 02:15:26.760
<v 4>We decided,
we decided that north was up.
Yeah.
It's so subjective too.</v>

2282
02:15:26.761 --> 02:15:28.950
We've stopped to think about like what's up and what's down.

2283
02:15:29.240 --> 02:15:33.390
Like if the universe is this huge,
giant,
infinite thing and we're on a ball,

2284
02:15:33.620 --> 02:15:37.530
who are you to say which way is up?
The whole thing is circular.
It's spinning,

2285
02:15:37.800 --> 02:15:39.370
it's spinning around another ball.

2286
02:15:39.371 --> 02:15:42.600
And that ball is a part of a giant cluster that's spinning around at Cirque

2287
02:15:42.710 --> 02:15:43.500
wipeout.
Fuck.

2288
02:15:43.500 --> 02:15:46.950
How do you know what up is which way up when we can agree that it's gotta be one

2289
02:15:46.951 --> 02:15:51.060
of two places.
Right?
Cause there are polls that we,
that we were spinning around.

2290
02:15:51.080 --> 02:15:54.990
Yes,
but which ones north in which one?
South meaning,
which one should we put up?

2291
02:15:55.230 --> 02:15:58.740
It's just a matter of convention that needs maps easier to read.
If you tried

2292
02:15:58.920 --> 02:16:02.700
<v 3>Rita upside down map,
which exist,
we're all the letters can be red,
but the,</v>

2293
02:16:02.730 --> 02:16:06.690
but the land masses are upside down.
It's very confusing,

2294
02:16:06.850 --> 02:16:07.770
I'm sure.

2295
02:16:08.190 --> 02:16:13.190
But if you're standing in the south pole up as above you,

2296
02:16:14.830 --> 02:16:15.663
<v 8>that's up.</v>

2297
02:16:15.920 --> 02:16:18.200
<v 3>Yeah.
In every direction you faces north.</v>

2298
02:16:19.970 --> 02:16:21.320
There is no east or west

2299
02:16:21.420 --> 02:16:24.930
<v 4>standing on the South Pole.
What?
Yeah.
How's that work?</v>

2300
02:16:25.790 --> 02:16:30.050
<v 3>Well,
you've run out of east [inaudible]</v>

2301
02:16:30.700 --> 02:16:34.690
<v 4>because there's no,
there's no more,
there's no more circle around the earth.</v>

2302
02:16:34.691 --> 02:16:37.720
Now you're just at a point.
Oh,
I see.
And so yeah,

2303
02:16:37.721 --> 02:16:42.721
there's a famous puzzle about this and I think it goes something like a hunter

2304
02:16:43.211 --> 02:16:46.690
walks,
um,
you know,

2305
02:16:46.810 --> 02:16:51.810
10 feet south and then 10 feet east and 10 feet north and he's back where he

2306
02:16:51.881 --> 02:16:55.210
began.
What color was the bear he shot.
Huh?

2307
02:16:55.270 --> 02:16:57.520
And the answer is white because he's clearly at the North Pole.

2308
02:16:58.690 --> 02:17:02.470
That's the only way you could make,
you could do that walking like go south,

2309
02:17:02.680 --> 02:17:05.050
go east,
go north and you're back where you started.

2310
02:17:05.051 --> 02:17:08.230
It would have to be at the North Pole.
Right.
But how could there not be an east?

2311
02:17:08.231 --> 02:17:09.130
Cause if you're standing,

2312
02:17:09.131 --> 02:17:13.540
let's say you're standing at the very point of the North Pole,
the very top.

2313
02:17:13.810 --> 02:17:16.420
If you travel east,
you can't,

2314
02:17:17.170 --> 02:17:21.470
you have to go south a little bit first before you could go east.
Oh,
it's,

2315
02:17:21.530 --> 02:17:26.350
it's finished.
Go sideways when that tape now that would be north.
Oh,
I see.

2316
02:17:26.560 --> 02:17:29.170
Oh,
I see what you're saying.
I'm saying you were saying like East,
west,

2317
02:17:29.171 --> 02:17:30.370
forget wires.
A circle.

2318
02:17:30.371 --> 02:17:33.970
Would you have to go though before you could go east a step?
Yeah.

2319
02:17:33.971 --> 02:17:34.600
You'd have to go,

2320
02:17:34.600 --> 02:17:38.890
we'd have to define what's the smallest amount of distance you could travel and

2321
02:17:38.891 --> 02:17:41.770
still say that you moved.
Hmm.
Yeah,

2322
02:17:41.771 --> 02:17:44.350
because like I would say an inch or less,

2323
02:17:44.790 --> 02:17:48.540
I got the tiniest amount and then you go east.
Yeah.
I mean we're,
we're,

2324
02:17:48.700 --> 02:17:50.800
if we measure millimeters and how,

2325
02:17:50.801 --> 02:17:55.120
how precisely I remeasuring the point that is the north or South Pole.

2326
02:17:55.480 --> 02:17:58.240
Because if you're on that point,
your body is already bigger than the point.

2327
02:17:58.241 --> 02:18:00.070
So you can put,
you know,
but you need that.

2328
02:18:00.071 --> 02:18:03.670
You need to get away from it so that you can go around what the,

2329
02:18:03.700 --> 02:18:06.130
what's going to happen.
Maybe you can answer this.
Maybe can't,

2330
02:18:06.220 --> 02:18:10.150
what is gonna happen if the polls shift?
I don't know.
I haven't,

2331
02:18:10.180 --> 02:18:12.700
I haven't actually read a lot about what that could cause it.

2332
02:18:12.970 --> 02:18:16.390
It could be like a y two k thing where it's like no one even notices and they're

2333
02:18:16.391 --> 02:18:20.440
like,
oh,
but it could also mess stuff up I guess.
Um,

2334
02:18:20.980 --> 02:18:23.170
I dunno.
I Dunno.
What about animals that,

2335
02:18:23.230 --> 02:18:26.340
that can detect a magnetic fields and use it to navigate?

2336
02:18:26.341 --> 02:18:28.870
Are they going to be all freaked out?
What animals do that?

2337
02:18:29.280 --> 02:18:33.730
I think some migratory birds do.
That's what they do.
They detect magnetic.
Yeah,

2338
02:18:33.731 --> 02:18:35.470
I think so.
What the fuck?

2339
02:18:35.490 --> 02:18:38.530
Like rather than having the same five typical senses we have,

2340
02:18:38.531 --> 02:18:42.910
they've got one for magnets.
Bazaar.
Yeah.

2341
02:18:43.300 --> 02:18:47.650
How is that even possible that they feel they have a magnet in their head had

2342
02:18:47.651 --> 02:18:50.880
tells them where,
you know,
that's what like woodsmen always,
uh,

2343
02:18:50.980 --> 02:18:53.830
talk about like real outdoors,
the true north,

2344
02:18:53.831 --> 02:18:58.250
like having a good compass and also they use it as sort of an analogy to morals.

2345
02:18:58.370 --> 02:19:01.930
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
I understand.
True north,
you know,

2346
02:19:01.931 --> 02:19:03.760
this moral compass that they have,

2347
02:19:03.761 --> 02:19:07.630
it's very similar to the compass that an animal must have or a bird.

2348
02:19:07.880 --> 02:19:11.830
There are also cultures that don't have words for left and right.

2349
02:19:12.460 --> 02:19:17.440
Everything is just a,
uh,
north,
south,
east or west.
Really.
Yeah.

2350
02:19:17.500 --> 02:19:20.140
So you would never say,
hey,
could you give me that thing that's on your left?

2351
02:19:20.141 --> 02:19:22.570
You'd say,
Oh,
could you give me that thing that south of you,

2352
02:19:23.680 --> 02:19:28.250
what culture are those?
I think it's an aboriginal culture in Australia.
And so

2353
02:19:28.280 --> 02:19:29.730
<v 3>this is falls into the PSAP.</v>

2354
02:19:29.731 --> 02:19:33.920
You're worth hypothesis that like the words that you have changed how you can

2355
02:19:33.921 --> 02:19:34.580
think.

2356
02:19:34.580 --> 02:19:38.270
And if you lived in a culture that did not have the award for left and right,

2357
02:19:38.300 --> 02:19:43.300
are you like less individualistic because things aren't defined by you?

2358
02:19:44.300 --> 02:19:45.440
They're defined by the earth.

2359
02:19:45.650 --> 02:19:49.130
It's either north or south regardless of which way you face.

2360
02:19:49.160 --> 02:19:51.980
Whereas in our society,
like left changes,

2361
02:19:51.981 --> 02:19:56.270
my left changes according to me and so therefore like individual people's

2362
02:19:56.271 --> 02:20:01.250
perspectives matter and define how I talk about things in the environment.

2363
02:20:01.350 --> 02:20:04.740
<v 1>That's fascinating because left and right,
we associate with handedness,</v>

2364
02:20:04.780 --> 02:20:08.580
whereas east and West is [inaudible] position on the map

2365
02:20:08.690 --> 02:20:13.390
<v 3>does always east no matter which way I faced,
but left my left is changing.</v>

2366
02:20:13.660 --> 02:20:17.270
<v 1>Hmm.
Yeah.
But if you're facing,
if you're talking about stage right,</v>

2367
02:20:17.810 --> 02:20:19.550
would you talk about West

2368
02:20:20.320 --> 02:20:25.160
<v 3>or would you talk about east?
Uh Oh well it would depend how,</v>

2369
02:20:25.170 --> 02:20:26.730
which way the stage was built.

2370
02:20:27.040 --> 02:20:29.620
<v 1>Well,
I say we'll stage is a weird like,</v>

2371
02:20:29.800 --> 02:20:34.090
like say if you were in a building and then I said,
hey man,

2372
02:20:34.660 --> 02:20:37.120
go,
go east.
Would you need a compass?

2373
02:20:37.200 --> 02:20:40.710
<v 3>No.
Like they just always know which way north is</v>

2374
02:20:42.690 --> 02:20:45.480
because it's so important.
They don't have a word for left and right.
Right.

2375
02:20:45.660 --> 02:20:47.490
I don't know how to answer this one,

2376
02:20:47.491 --> 02:20:52.491
but how do you describe left and right to some someone who has never heard of

2377
02:20:53.941 --> 02:20:54.870
those concepts?

2378
02:20:55.440 --> 02:20:56.650
<v 1>My kids,
you know,</v>

2379
02:20:56.670 --> 02:21:01.170
I have a six year old and a four year old and I tried to describe left and right

2380
02:21:01.740 --> 02:21:05.790
and uh,
my daughter,
one of the ways that I,

2381
02:21:05.910 --> 02:21:10.350
I mean this doesn't make any sense other than showing her because um,

2382
02:21:10.580 --> 02:21:11.960
I say,
um,

2383
02:21:12.060 --> 02:21:16.080
make the letter l with your hand and the one that looks like analysis your left.

2384
02:21:16.140 --> 02:21:20.430
No,
the one that points like say if it,
is it pointing,

2385
02:21:20.700 --> 02:21:23.900
if like this is what I say,
like if you're looking at me,
yeah.
And you're,

2386
02:21:23.901 --> 02:21:27.600
you're writing,
you know like say you're writing the name of Laura.
Yeah.

2387
02:21:27.930 --> 02:21:29.550
Like where's your thumb pointing?

2388
02:21:29.640 --> 02:21:33.780
That's pointing towards your left and if you hold your hand up and your hand

2389
02:21:33.810 --> 02:21:37.590
makes an l see where your index finger,
that's the law.
That's the left.

2390
02:21:37.680 --> 02:21:40.170
So this one's pointing to the left.
This one is the left.

2391
02:21:40.200 --> 02:21:42.420
But you've got to make sure that you're not looking at your hands,

2392
02:21:42.780 --> 02:21:47.640
palms facing because then then the Ellis made by the right hand.
Yeah.

2393
02:21:47.790 --> 02:21:49.950
So if you hold your hand up,
I guess,

2394
02:21:50.610 --> 02:21:54.240
and that is the l like if forms it,
that's the one that is the Ale.

2395
02:21:54.420 --> 02:21:57.370
So if you hold your hand up and you see an l in front of you,
that's the,

2396
02:21:57.420 --> 02:21:59.310
that's the left,
right?

2397
02:22:00.130 --> 02:22:04.200
And if it's holding your other hand up and it's making an l to the other person,

2398
02:22:04.620 --> 02:22:09.210
but that's confusing.
Like get it little kid to write on a window,
like the one,

2399
02:22:09.240 --> 02:22:12.430
like a steamy,
like if they're taking a shower,
right.

2400
02:22:12.480 --> 02:22:16.500
Your name so that I could read it.
Did they get that?
No,

2401
02:22:16.590 --> 02:22:18.000
they always write it the wrong way.

2402
02:22:18.270 --> 02:22:21.510
And then you got to show him how to deal with the other way and they go,
oh,
okay.

2403
02:22:21.511 --> 02:22:25.720
But it's so squirrely in their head.
It's like,
oh,
like

2404
02:22:27.420 --> 02:22:28.740
<v 0>fascinating how kids,</v>

2405
02:22:29.370 --> 02:22:33.920
<v 3>Eh,
have to develop some of these,
uh,
ideas about the world,
like the,</v>

2406
02:22:33.970 --> 02:22:36.660
the old,
uh,
um,
uh,

2407
02:22:36.750 --> 02:22:41.670
constancy of volume or what does it really called?
Um,
uh,

2408
02:22:41.870 --> 02:22:45.690
that things stay the way they are when you're not looking like a really small

2409
02:22:45.691 --> 02:22:48.570
kid will even think that.
Like when they don't see you,
you're gone.

2410
02:22:48.571 --> 02:22:51.420
Like peekaboo was a really terrifying and,

2411
02:22:51.430 --> 02:22:56.370
and an amazing game to a child.
Yeah,
I vary.
I'm talking like a baby.
Right.

2412
02:22:56.430 --> 02:23:00.300
Um,
but then,
uh,
look this up on,
on youtube the,

2413
02:23:00.360 --> 02:23:04.140
they show an experiment where you take two different size containers.

2414
02:23:04.320 --> 02:23:08.670
One's really tall and skinny and one's short and fat and the tall skinny ones

2415
02:23:08.671 --> 02:23:09.504
full of water.

2416
02:23:09.720 --> 02:23:12.150
And then they pour the water into the other container and they're like,

2417
02:23:12.151 --> 02:23:15.480
which one has more water than like,
which one's bigger now?

2418
02:23:15.540 --> 02:23:18.060
And clearly the same amount of water is still there.

2419
02:23:18.540 --> 02:23:21.470
You just saw them pour the water.
No water was taken away.
Right?

2420
02:23:21.510 --> 02:23:26.130
But a kid doesn't get that yet.
They think that,
oh well it's not nearly as tall,

2421
02:23:26.131 --> 02:23:29.550
this other glass,
so there's must be less water.
And they'll grill the kid like,

2422
02:23:29.551 --> 02:23:32.280
well,
where'd the water go?
And the kid won't even know,

2423
02:23:32.400 --> 02:23:37.110
but will insist that there's less water now because it looks smaller.

2424
02:23:37.520 --> 02:23:40.400
<v 0>Is that a perception thing?
Like an animal thing,
like larger,</v>

2425
02:23:40.401 --> 02:23:42.850
taller things are more dangerous?
Sure,

2426
02:23:43.390 --> 02:23:45.520
<v 3>sure.
That it's,
it's like that's what matters.</v>

2427
02:23:45.521 --> 02:23:47.970
And it takes a while to understand the,

2428
02:23:48.060 --> 02:23:53.060
the less needed for survival process of realizing,

2429
02:23:53.290 --> 02:23:55.330
oh,
that's actually stayed constant.

2430
02:23:55.650 --> 02:23:59.220
<v 0>That kind of makes sense when you think about how animals will make themselves</v>

2431
02:23:59.221 --> 02:24:00.960
look bigger.
Yeah.
Like they,

2432
02:24:00.961 --> 02:24:04.770
their hair sticks up on it back in order to give them a sense of,

2433
02:24:04.840 --> 02:24:08.670
or an appearance of having more mass.
Yeah.
You know,
rowing,
yeah.

2434
02:24:08.760 --> 02:24:12.360
Bears will stand up on their hind legs and they tell people,

2435
02:24:12.390 --> 02:24:16.110
like if you're in you,
you encounter certain animals like mountain lions,

2436
02:24:16.111 --> 02:24:20.910
you should make,
make yourself look bigger.
Like wave your arms get larger.

2437
02:24:21.180 --> 02:24:23.220
If you have someone with you,
like a child,

2438
02:24:23.370 --> 02:24:28.350
put them on your show Lau and make it look like it's a bigger thing.
Right?
Yeah.

2439
02:24:28.560 --> 02:24:33.510
Like it's like a appear more of a,
a larger tricks.
The animal.
Yeah.

2440
02:24:33.540 --> 02:24:36.560
They're dumb as shit.
Yeah.
They're Dominican.

2441
02:24:36.570 --> 02:24:39.360
It's fun to watch these kid experiments because you're like,
oh wow,

2442
02:24:39.361 --> 02:24:42.410
kids are dumb.
They think that,

2443
02:24:42.580 --> 02:24:46.660
<v 3>you know,
this is,
uh,
any,
any idiot could tell Ya.</v>

2444
02:24:47.190 --> 02:24:48.330
<v 0>Well,
it's not that they're dumb,</v>

2445
02:24:48.331 --> 02:24:51.210
it's that they haven't come across this problem yet to solve.

2446
02:24:51.211 --> 02:24:53.170
So they don't have the data yet.
Exactly.

2447
02:24:53.171 --> 02:24:56.550
Like there's a difference between dom and a lack of data.

2448
02:24:56.700 --> 02:25:00.390
When you have a person and they're 50 years old and they still think that the

2449
02:25:00.391 --> 02:25:04.830
world is flat and they still think the earth is 6,000 years old and they still

2450
02:25:04.831 --> 02:25:08.400
think,
well that's a dumb person.
That's like,
they're the data,

2451
02:25:08.610 --> 02:25:10.440
they've probably been exposed to the evidence,

2452
02:25:10.460 --> 02:25:15.420
they be exposed to 50 years of Western civilization and their perceptions of

2453
02:25:15.421 --> 02:25:19.590
life are,
it's insane.
Yeah.
Given the data that's available,

2454
02:25:19.800 --> 02:25:24.650
that's a dumb person,
but a baby's just this bundle of potential that just,

2455
02:25:24.680 --> 02:25:28.740
that doesn't have any data yet.
And so they're just acting on,
you know,
like,

2456
02:25:29.020 --> 02:25:34.020
well what seems to make sense from an evolutionary standpoint or from a genetic

2457
02:25:34.291 --> 02:25:38.750
standpoint,
their animal instincts.
Very bizarre.

2458
02:25:39.170 --> 02:25:40.760
The idea also,

2459
02:25:40.790 --> 02:25:45.790
the idea that this is all changing and growing and then your children will have

2460
02:25:47.601 --> 02:25:51.230
the benefit of the information that you've accumulated over your life,

2461
02:25:51.620 --> 02:25:53.030
like through epigenetics,

2462
02:25:53.090 --> 02:25:55.890
and it's going to somehow or another pass to your children and they'll want to

2463
02:25:55.891 --> 02:25:57.800
know about the head.
I don't know about that either.

2464
02:25:58.470 --> 02:25:59.303
<v 5>Hmm.</v>

2465
02:25:59.780 --> 02:25:59.931
<v 3>Well,</v>

2466
02:25:59.931 --> 02:26:03.770
they say that certain things like even racism can be passed down to children.

2467
02:26:04.560 --> 02:26:07.830
You mean genetically,
genetically,
chemically.
Yeah.
I don't,

2468
02:26:07.960 --> 02:26:10.010
I haven't seen a lot of evidence for that kind of stuff.

2469
02:26:10.011 --> 02:26:13.550
But there was a famous experiment where a guy taught worms to move through a

2470
02:26:13.551 --> 02:26:18.551
maze and then he like ground them up and fed them to some other worms and those

2471
02:26:18.561 --> 02:26:21.830
worms like knew how to solve the maze without having to be taught.

2472
02:26:22.430 --> 02:26:23.960
But it's never been replicated.

2473
02:26:24.050 --> 02:26:27.380
But wouldn't that be cool if we found out that there was like a chemical basis

2474
02:26:27.381 --> 02:26:29.630
from Emory?
That would be amazing.
Yeah.

2475
02:26:30.010 --> 02:26:33.850
<v 0>Well they have shown that,
um,
they've taken,</v>

2476
02:26:33.880 --> 02:26:38.880
I believe it was mice and they used a certain smell and when that certain smell

2477
02:26:40.450 --> 02:26:41.800
was introduced to the mice,

2478
02:26:41.801 --> 02:26:45.430
they gave them a chemical shock or they gave them electrical shock on their feet

2479
02:26:45.970 --> 02:26:50.970
and the children of those mice when exposed to that smells like a citrusy smell.

2480
02:26:51.340 --> 02:26:53.260
They would have a panic attack.
Really.

2481
02:26:53.290 --> 02:26:57.280
They would have this panicky moment where they anticipated being shocked.
Huh.

2482
02:26:57.310 --> 02:27:00.790
Because it was programmed in their DNA that that smell equals danger.

2483
02:27:02.310 --> 02:27:05.160
That smell equals pain or discomfort,
right?

2484
02:27:06.290 --> 02:27:10.100
<v 3>Yeah.
So,
so that's different than just natural selection.
Where do you say,
well,</v>

2485
02:27:10.101 --> 02:27:13.730
the,
the,
the mice that just naturally didn't like that smell.

2486
02:27:13.731 --> 02:27:16.850
We're the ones that lived longer procreated more.
And so that's why

2487
02:27:17.200 --> 02:27:20.120
<v 0>I think that's probably true as well.
Yeah.</v>

2488
02:27:20.140 --> 02:27:22.690
I think it's one of those things like when we're talking about conspiracies,

2489
02:27:22.910 --> 02:27:26.560
you know,
while people,
can it just be a random coincidence?
Yes,
it can be,

2490
02:27:26.770 --> 02:27:30.730
but there's also evidence that people can spire,
right?
So there's both,

2491
02:27:30.731 --> 02:27:34.540
and we have this tendency to want to wrap things up in a nice,
neat little bow.

2492
02:27:34.840 --> 02:27:38.440
So the,
the concept of natural selection will,
there's natural selection.

2493
02:27:38.441 --> 02:27:40.840
This is very simple to explain its natural selection.

2494
02:27:41.050 --> 02:27:44.910
No natural selection is a factor.
That's also a fight.

2495
02:27:44.911 --> 02:27:48.160
It's not like it's nonexistent.
It,
no,
that happens as well.

2496
02:27:48.280 --> 02:27:51.880
But then there's also this weirdness is his weirdness where information is

2497
02:27:51.881 --> 02:27:52.714
transferred.

2498
02:27:52.780 --> 02:27:57.780
Like I've done Jujitsu since I was 1996 is when I started so in and I've also

2499
02:28:01.121 --> 02:28:05.080
been a commentator for more than a thousand professional fights.

2500
02:28:05.260 --> 02:28:10.260
I probably seen more mixed martial arts fights then most of the population ever

2501
02:28:11.400 --> 02:28:15.820
will in real life too.
And my kids,

2502
02:28:15.880 --> 02:28:18.580
when I watch them roll around,
when they watched them play,

2503
02:28:18.850 --> 02:28:20.110
especially my youngest,

2504
02:28:20.320 --> 02:28:25.320
she has instinctive moves that I don't think our natural moves like when they're

2505
02:28:26.271 --> 02:28:27.890
rolling around my,
my,

2506
02:28:28.070 --> 02:28:31.550
like there's a thing called the over under and it's what you do when you,

2507
02:28:31.551 --> 02:28:35.360
when you take someone's back taking someone's back is you'd gain an advantageous

2508
02:28:35.361 --> 02:28:39.050
position by being behind them and controlling their body in a way that they can

2509
02:28:39.051 --> 02:28:40.280
attack you,
but you can attack that.

2510
02:28:40.550 --> 02:28:44.030
You're forced into a very defensive position and they're in a very dominant spot

2511
02:28:44.300 --> 02:28:47.480
and the over under is one arm over shoulder,

2512
02:28:47.540 --> 02:28:50.750
one on under the armpit and you clasp your hands together and it's a very

2513
02:28:50.751 --> 02:28:54.650
dominant mode of control.
But it's not,
I don't think it's instinctual,

2514
02:28:54.830 --> 02:28:58.160
but my daughter goes to it immediate huh?
When my daughter,

2515
02:28:58.161 --> 02:29:02.780
who's who was three at the time when she was rolling around playing on the bed

2516
02:29:02.781 --> 02:29:05.980
with my,
on my,
um,
at the time,
five-year-old,

2517
02:29:06.410 --> 02:29:09.350
she would go over under all the time and then she would throw her legs around

2518
02:29:09.351 --> 02:29:13.250
and get her hooks in,
like instinctually being to do it.

2519
02:29:13.390 --> 02:29:18.390
He said these are like traditional Jujitsu positions and I think that it's in

2520
02:29:18.501 --> 02:29:21.320
her DNA.
I really do.
I'm like,
watch your took them out.

2521
02:29:21.560 --> 02:29:24.470
I watched her go from side control to the mount.

2522
02:29:24.590 --> 02:29:27.920
She slid her knee across the belly.
She did it like Jujitsu style.

2523
02:29:28.190 --> 02:29:33.190
Like I don't think that that's a natural thing to have like baby to have to do

2524
02:29:33.471 --> 02:29:36.410
some more experiments,
take a look at her genome.

2525
02:29:36.830 --> 02:29:41.000
I really think that it's instinctual and also like I've teaching them striking

2526
02:29:41.001 --> 02:29:42.050
and the way they learn it,

2527
02:29:42.051 --> 02:29:45.530
it's like they're learning and like they already knew it.
It's really weird.

2528
02:29:45.860 --> 02:29:46.371
They're learning,

2529
02:29:46.371 --> 02:29:49.610
like pivoting off the ball of their feet and throwing their weight into things.

2530
02:29:49.820 --> 02:29:52.580
It seems totally natural to them.
It's very strange.

2531
02:29:52.770 --> 02:29:56.030
I think if you catch people young enough,
they're still plastic enough that they,

2532
02:29:56.031 --> 02:29:59.210
they'll just get it.
Uh,
like language for instance.
And you know,

2533
02:29:59.211 --> 02:30:04.170
I learned English.
How long did it take me to learn English?
How long?

2534
02:30:04.171 --> 02:30:07.600
Maybe two years until you started talking about like when was I fluent enough?

2535
02:30:07.750 --> 02:30:09.810
Someone would say like,
yeah,
you'd pass a test.

2536
02:30:11.110 --> 02:30:14.880
Well is also is a weird thing where people say that their youngest learns

2537
02:30:14.881 --> 02:30:18.780
quicker because the youngest is around only adults.

2538
02:30:19.020 --> 02:30:22.140
So the youngest is sort of like forced to like try to be,

2539
02:30:22.141 --> 02:30:23.490
or like the things that they're around,

2540
02:30:24.120 --> 02:30:28.770
whereas the oldest has younger people around.
Exactly.
Whereas if your,

2541
02:30:28.830 --> 02:30:32.070
uh,
or the not the youngest,
I mean like the first born,

2542
02:30:32.370 --> 02:30:36.760
not the youngest I should say,
a learns quickest.
Whereas the,
um,

2543
02:30:36.840 --> 02:30:39.930
the ones that are born later,
they have all these little people that talk,

2544
02:30:40.140 --> 02:30:40.531
you know,

2545
02:30:40.531 --> 02:30:45.531
like babies around and takes a little longer to figure out how to communicate

2546
02:30:45.541 --> 02:30:49.680
like an adult.
Yeah.
The first born was like,
oh,

2547
02:30:49.740 --> 02:30:54.720
I'm the only kid here.
A better,
yeah,
yeah.
Pick it up.
Yeah.
You have to be like,

2548
02:30:54.750 --> 02:30:56.040
you have to imitate your atmosphere.

2549
02:30:57.210 --> 02:30:58.043
<v 9>Okay.</v>

2550
02:30:58.370 --> 02:31:02.600
<v 0>Where you a firstborn?
Yeah.
Siblings.
Yes.
I have an older or younger sister.
Okay.</v>

2551
02:31:02.990 --> 02:31:06.410
Me Too of younger sister dude.
We're like wow.

2552
02:31:07.310 --> 02:31:09.290
Crazy.
I'm probably the only ones,

2553
02:31:09.900 --> 02:31:14.690
probably the only two guys who have younger sisters who would have thought,
uh,

2554
02:31:15.020 --> 02:31:19.710
yeah,
I'm going to have to pee again.
I this is incredible.
You can do it.
Yeah,

2555
02:31:19.711 --> 02:31:20.070
I can do

2556
02:31:20.070 --> 02:31:22.160
<v 1>it.
Yeah,
go ahead.
Go Pee.
You promise you're not.
Yeah.</v>

2557
02:31:22.190 --> 02:31:24.720
You already know you're going to judge me when I even say look at that guy.

2558
02:31:24.721 --> 02:31:27.630
He just can't even do that.
You're a slave to his by judge you.

2559
02:31:27.631 --> 02:31:31.710
It will be highly good.
Okay,
good,
good.
Excellent.
So we'll um,

2560
02:31:32.550 --> 02:31:35.610
we only have about 15 minutes left anyway before we turn into a pumpkin.

2561
02:31:35.880 --> 02:31:39.180
This is a fascinating conversation and if your highest fuck right now,
I'm sorry.

2562
02:31:39.480 --> 02:31:43.470
I'm sorry for freaking you out.
Me.
Um,

2563
02:31:43.620 --> 02:31:45.750
these kind of conversations are always really cool though.

2564
02:31:45.900 --> 02:31:49.830
Whenever you're a involved in a conversation where you're sitting with someone

2565
02:31:49.831 --> 02:31:54.630
who you've never talked to before and you start going over weird shit like

2566
02:31:54.930 --> 02:31:59.370
genetics and what causes a person to be this and that and what,

2567
02:31:59.990 --> 02:32:04.200
what,
what are the steps that you take to become a human being?

2568
02:32:04.200 --> 02:32:09.200
And it's also like our rudimentary knowledge of wha how,

2569
02:32:09.511 --> 02:32:12.410
how he,
like when he was talking about,
uh,
we're,

2570
02:32:12.411 --> 02:32:17.411
we're talking about learn things and how much of it is natural selection and

2571
02:32:17.581 --> 02:32:21.060
then you find out things like the,
the mouse test where they,

2572
02:32:21.150 --> 02:32:24.270
they know that mice associate that sense of smell,

2573
02:32:24.300 --> 02:32:26.340
that smelling that thing with an electrical shock.

2574
02:32:26.370 --> 02:32:29.070
Even though these mice have never experienced that electrical shock,

2575
02:32:29.071 --> 02:32:30.060
it was their parents doing it.

2576
02:32:30.220 --> 02:32:34.140
Like that's pretty clear evidence that there's something being transmitted

2577
02:32:34.141 --> 02:32:38.820
through genetics.
Whatever it is,
they don't know.
But we'll know someday.

2578
02:32:38.940 --> 02:32:42.780
Someday we'll be like,
oh well that's,
yeah,
they definitely,
like we've found,

2579
02:32:42.781 --> 02:32:47.700
we've isolated the genes that cause people to transmit certain bits of

2580
02:32:47.701 --> 02:32:51.210
information to their children that are useful.
Like right now we're,

2581
02:32:52.290 --> 02:32:57.240
we're not much different than the people that we mock from a long time ago.

2582
02:32:57.240 --> 02:32:59.640
The thought that the earth was the center of the universe,
you know,

2583
02:33:00.210 --> 02:33:03.300
like the amount of information that we have.

2584
02:33:04.170 --> 02:33:08.560
I was just saying that as you're back from your potty break,
oh,

2585
02:33:08.561 --> 02:33:09.480
it feels so much better.

2586
02:33:09.540 --> 02:33:14.540
I'm sure the amount of information that we have today is kind of akin to like

2587
02:33:15.100 --> 02:33:15.730
we,
we,

2588
02:33:15.730 --> 02:33:20.010
we mock like people that lived in Galileo's time for not knowing that he was

2589
02:33:20.011 --> 02:33:23.190
correct,
that the earth was not the center of the universe.
You know,

2590
02:33:23.191 --> 02:33:26.880
we're like God out.
They pulled the torture,
the poor guy,
you know,
or,

2591
02:33:26.881 --> 02:33:30.360
or Bruno for the saying that the universe is infinite.

2592
02:33:30.361 --> 02:33:34.950
They burned them alive.
Right,
right.
You know,
and we think,
God,
this is so stupid,

2593
02:33:35.160 --> 02:33:39.360
but what we know now,
whenever you're alive,
the,

2594
02:33:39.361 --> 02:33:44.361
at that point in time is the greatest moment of knowledge in human history.

2595
02:33:44.791 --> 02:33:47.550
It is,
right?
Yeah.
And you think,
Oh wow,

2596
02:33:47.551 --> 02:33:49.980
so glad I'm here and not in the past,

2597
02:33:50.010 --> 02:33:52.980
but not giving and taking you collapses of civilizations,

2598
02:33:52.981 --> 02:33:56.490
which is her story entirely.
Well,
yeah,
it's tough.
It's a little more complicated,

2599
02:33:56.491 --> 02:33:59.670
but yeah.
But yeah,
it's not linear entirely,

2600
02:33:59.671 --> 02:34:02.340
but it's Kinda like an up and down up and it's progressive.

2601
02:34:02.700 --> 02:34:04.710
So at this point in time,
you know,

2602
02:34:04.711 --> 02:34:08.190
when we're talking about information being transferred from parents to children

2603
02:34:08.460 --> 02:34:11.130
and we're like,
I wonder,
I wonder,
I mean it natural selection.
I went,

2604
02:34:11.340 --> 02:34:13.320
but we don't,
we don't know it was one day,

2605
02:34:13.500 --> 02:34:16.530
whether it's a thousand years from now or whatever it is,
they're going to go,
oh,

2606
02:34:16.531 --> 02:34:18.010
those dummies.
They didn't even know.
I

2607
02:34:18.010 --> 02:34:21.160
<v 3>know.
Look at this,
we've got audio recording of Michael Stevens Sane.</v>

2608
02:34:21.340 --> 02:34:25.060
I don't know.
I think,
I think so.
Maybe natural selection.
And they're like,

2609
02:34:25.240 --> 02:34:29.650
that idiot fucking prince.
He thinks that they're spraying shit

2610
02:34:29.730 --> 02:34:34.640
<v 1>over the ghetto and making people fight.
No,
Duh.
But you know,
it's just,</v>

2611
02:34:34.641 --> 02:34:38.790
uh,
it's just one of those things is information progresses.

2612
02:34:39.180 --> 02:34:40.013
We'll find out

2613
02:34:40.200 --> 02:34:43.380
<v 3>that,
that this lava lamp,
by the ways,
huge that's in this room.</v>

2614
02:34:43.410 --> 02:34:45.030
It takes a long time to warm up.

2615
02:34:45.220 --> 02:34:48.630
<v 1>Yeah.
Well,
this podcast is almost three hours old and Jamie,</v>

2616
02:34:48.631 --> 02:34:52.840
you probably switched it on half hour before the show.
Yeah,
it takes a few hours,

2617
02:34:52.841 --> 02:34:55.300
but look at the little ones,
little ones up and cooking.

2618
02:34:55.340 --> 02:35:00.110
<v 3>That's cooking really well.
Wow.
That's a great lava lamp.
This big one,
um,</v>

2619
02:35:00.320 --> 02:35:03.350
never really gets going.
We need to shut up to leave it on all night,
all day.

2620
02:35:03.540 --> 02:35:08.230
Then Shit could go wrong.
Yeah.
We had one that had a crack in it.
Oh yeah.

2621
02:35:08.450 --> 02:35:11.570
We noticed it.
Where like,
is that a crack?
Then we had to learn,
you know,

2622
02:35:11.571 --> 02:35:16.010
lava lamps are used to generate random numbers and they can generate them very,

2623
02:35:16.011 --> 02:35:16.844
very well.

2624
02:35:16.940 --> 02:35:21.800
They're very difficult to find patterns in the,
if you,

2625
02:35:21.830 --> 02:35:23.060
I don't know how they do it,
but they,

2626
02:35:23.080 --> 02:35:26.900
they'll look at the shapes and movement of a lava lamp and that'll generate

2627
02:35:26.901 --> 02:35:31.370
numbers and they don't have patterns in them.
Really?
Yeah,

2628
02:35:31.640 --> 02:35:33.950
so you know you can go to like random.org.

2629
02:35:33.980 --> 02:35:38.980
I just did an episode on what really is random and random.org uses atmospheric

2630
02:35:38.991 --> 02:35:43.100
noise,
just noise in the atmosphere,
like radio static to generate numbers.

2631
02:35:43.130 --> 02:35:44.720
Pretty good lava lamps.

2632
02:35:44.750 --> 02:35:47.210
There used to be a website that had a lava lamp and you would type in,

2633
02:35:47.211 --> 02:35:50.750
give me random number and it would be based on the state of the lava lamp.

2634
02:35:50.870 --> 02:35:53.090
Give you a random number.
Uh,

2635
02:35:53.350 --> 02:35:55.160
<v 1>so if you watched a lava lamp,</v>

2636
02:35:55.161 --> 02:35:59.020
so if we had that lava lamp on and we maintain the same amount of heat coming

2637
02:35:59.021 --> 02:36:01.930
off of the light bulb in the same water temperature and the,

2638
02:36:02.110 --> 02:36:05.920
<v 3>yeah,
but you,
but you don't though.
That's,
that's what makes it so random.
The,</v>

2639
02:36:05.930 --> 02:36:10.270
the initial conditions are so difficult to know precisely enough to predict

2640
02:36:10.330 --> 02:36:13.060
which way it's going to float the temperature.

2641
02:36:13.090 --> 02:36:16.690
We only know the temperature to like a few degrees,
you know,
uh,
or,

2642
02:36:16.770 --> 02:36:18.550
or a 10th of a degree,
but that,

2643
02:36:18.640 --> 02:36:22.210
that millions of a degree difference is what's going to make it move now rather

2644
02:36:22.211 --> 02:36:24.220
than neck.
Then in the next second,
you know,

2645
02:36:24.580 --> 02:36:28.540
<v 1>possible to make an ultimate lava lamp that was incredibly precise.</v>

2646
02:36:28.780 --> 02:36:33.780
So the amount of heat that comes off of the bowl was really like really precise.

2647
02:36:34.930 --> 02:36:37.690
The amount,
the temperature of the water was incredibly stable.

2648
02:36:37.960 --> 02:36:42.550
The consistency of the wax was uniform throughout and that you set this like

2649
02:36:42.670 --> 02:36:47.670
perfectly measured lava lamp with the glass being the exact same diameter or the

2650
02:36:49.421 --> 02:36:54.100
exact same thickness rather over the entire circumference of the,

2651
02:36:54.101 --> 02:36:57.340
of the bottle that holds the water and the wax.

2652
02:36:57.341 --> 02:37:01.030
And would it be possible to make an ultimate precise lava lamp?

2653
02:37:01.430 --> 02:37:04.250
<v 3>Well,
it would you,
you could predict it better.</v>

2654
02:37:04.580 --> 02:37:06.200
I still don't think that it would be precise,

2655
02:37:06.201 --> 02:37:10.040
like symmetric all the time unless you put in special controls that like didn't

2656
02:37:10.041 --> 02:37:12.950
release the wax until it was ready or whatever.
Is it the,

2657
02:37:13.270 --> 02:37:16.280
<v 1>the wax moving up and through the water,</v>

2658
02:37:16.280 --> 02:37:18.720
<v 3>which changes the temperature of,</v>

2659
02:37:19.280 --> 02:37:22.790
of the wax because it's not in contact with the heat at the bottom.

2660
02:37:25.100 --> 02:37:28.100
Are you asking what makes it so unpredictable?
Yeah,
yeah.

2661
02:37:28.101 --> 02:37:31.250
It's just like every little movement of those blobs is affecting all the other

2662
02:37:31.251 --> 02:37:35.810
molecules inside that system and those are affecting how something moves later.

2663
02:37:35.960 --> 02:37:39.740
It's like a butterfly flapping its wings causing a tornado in Brazil,
you know?

2664
02:37:39.790 --> 02:37:42.620
Yeah.
But that doesn't really work that way.
That's sort of dopey.

2665
02:37:42.980 --> 02:37:46.190
I hate that butter.
The Butterfly flapping the wings of a butterfly.
No,

2666
02:37:46.260 --> 02:37:49.670
but it eventually lead to be a hurricane.
No,
it can't really because no,

2667
02:37:49.671 --> 02:37:53.090
it's true.
Whether it does its patterns,
they caused that,
right?

2668
02:37:53.091 --> 02:37:56.210
We're not going to be able to know like,
Hey,
have that butterfly flaps its wings.

2669
02:37:56.211 --> 02:37:57.650
That'll cause a tornado,
right?

2670
02:37:57.680 --> 02:38:01.310
It's just the point is that that little difference in initial conditions could

2671
02:38:01.311 --> 02:38:05.600
result in a completely dramatically different outcome.

2672
02:38:06.140 --> 02:38:10.130
You can do this with a double pendulum and it's pretty insane.
You,
you,
you,

2673
02:38:10.310 --> 02:38:13.880
you put two pendulums up and you release them and it feels like you dropped him

2674
02:38:13.881 --> 02:38:16.610
from the same place and you can use a robot to do this and everything,

2675
02:38:16.970 --> 02:38:18.350
but after just a few seconds,

2676
02:38:18.351 --> 02:38:21.080
they're both spinning completely differently from one another.

2677
02:38:22.550 --> 02:38:25.610
It doesn't mean that the butterfly will always be causing tornadoes.

2678
02:38:25.611 --> 02:38:30.480
It just means that you,
you,
you,
you have no idea how many variables are,
are,

2679
02:38:30.490 --> 02:38:34.160
are involved in and one little thing changes another little thing and that can

2680
02:38:34.161 --> 02:38:39.161
cause an end result that is way bigger and way more different than if the

2681
02:38:39.891 --> 02:38:42.290
butterfly hadn't flapped its wings.
Really.

2682
02:38:42.291 --> 02:38:47.291
So Butterfly flapping its wings really can put into motion a chain of events

2683
02:38:48.380 --> 02:38:51.950
that could lead to a changing of a weather pattern.
Weather patterns.
Oh yeah,

2684
02:38:51.980 --> 02:38:55.730
yeah.
Really?
Yeah.
What does a butterfly effect when it flaps its wings?

2685
02:38:56.680 --> 02:38:58.190
This is more of like a,
yeah,
it,

2686
02:38:58.700 --> 02:39:02.570
this isn't like we've studied it and we found a butterfly and we blamed him for

2687
02:39:02.660 --> 02:39:06.560
Hurricane Sandy Butterfly.
Yeah.
It's more like the,

2688
02:39:06.610 --> 02:39:11.060
the principal is that a law,
that little tiny,

2689
02:39:11.600 --> 02:39:12.433
um,

2690
02:39:13.250 --> 02:39:17.750
movement of air caused some larger massive air to actually,
you know,

2691
02:39:17.751 --> 02:39:21.080
move a bit more and,
and,
and this all stair steps up

2692
02:39:22.460 --> 02:39:24.950
to the point where the hurricane could happen.

2693
02:39:25.100 --> 02:39:27.770
Another example would be knowing the position of the earth in,

2694
02:39:27.771 --> 02:39:31.580
in billions of years or just millions of years,
hundreds of thousands.

2695
02:39:31.850 --> 02:39:35.540
We can only really predict where it's going to be and,
and,
and we're,

2696
02:39:35.541 --> 02:39:38.300
all the other planets will be so far into the future.

2697
02:39:38.990 --> 02:39:41.210
And even though those systems are pretty,
you know,

2698
02:39:41.211 --> 02:39:44.340
it's going in a circle around the sun,
like that's it,
right?
Yeah.

2699
02:39:44.410 --> 02:39:48.170
We should be able to guess.
Right.
But at a certain point,
we don't know.

2700
02:39:48.350 --> 02:39:51.470
We don't have enough information.
Uh,
just,

2701
02:39:51.471 --> 02:39:56.060
just launching a satellite causes the earth to spend a little more slowly

2702
02:39:56.090 --> 02:40:00.330
changes its position a little bit.
Really.
The,
this the APP.
Yes.

2703
02:40:00.380 --> 02:40:02.250
So Neil bring off,
yeah.
Yeah.

2704
02:40:02.630 --> 02:40:06.460
Neil degrasse Tyson did a great calculation and in his book,
um,

2705
02:40:07.670 --> 02:40:11.060
death by black hole,
I think,
uh,
where he says,
yeah,
he just,

2706
02:40:11.061 --> 02:40:14.310
just what it took to send up that satellite never comes back down

2707
02:40:14.610 --> 02:40:16.740
<v 4>means that earth is going to be</v>

2708
02:40:18.450 --> 02:40:21.870
a few degrees in some different direction in a million years.

2709
02:40:22.710 --> 02:40:26.310
And we don't know which direction that's going to be unless we,

2710
02:40:26.430 --> 02:40:31.430
unless we have an incredible amount of information about that satellite and how

2711
02:40:31.801 --> 02:40:34.140
it affected earth when it left.
So

2712
02:40:34.220 --> 02:40:38.660
<v 0>every single piece plays a part there.</v>

2713
02:40:38.661 --> 02:40:43.310
Every single variable,
every movement plays a part in the ultimate end result.

2714
02:40:43.430 --> 02:40:46.520
<v 4>Totally.
Yeah.
And that's what makes the weather so difficult to predict.</v>

2715
02:40:47.500 --> 02:40:47.970
<v 9>Yeah.</v>

2716
02:40:47.970 --> 02:40:49.010
<v 4>Find a lava lamp,</v>

2717
02:40:49.460 --> 02:40:53.820
butterflies and shit and lava lamps fucking up in the lightning storms.
Yeah.
Wow.

2718
02:40:55.240 --> 02:41:00.070
<v 0>Yo,
we're always trips me out that ancient people were able to figure out the</v>

2719
02:41:00.071 --> 02:41:01.330
procession of the equinox.

2720
02:41:01.540 --> 02:41:05.890
<v 4>Right.
Like every day they were just like checking like,
yeah,
yeah.</v>

2721
02:41:06.070 --> 02:41:08.490
Same time of day has somehow I knew that it was the same time,

2722
02:41:08.740 --> 02:41:11.080
time of day and I marked it.
Or maybe what do they do?

2723
02:41:11.081 --> 02:41:15.250
They just watch and see where the sun was when it was at its highest point.

2724
02:41:15.730 --> 02:41:19.090
Make a little mark somehow and then they realize,
hey,

2725
02:41:19.091 --> 02:41:22.210
it's going in this like a loop thing.
Well,
not only that,
the loop,

2726
02:41:22.211 --> 02:41:27.190
isn't it like thousands of years,
like the wobble.
The full wow.
Right,
right,
right.

2727
02:41:27.790 --> 02:41:31.930
Like what is the,
I don't know actually.
It's a really long amount of time.

2728
02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:35.460
<v 0>Yeah.
The procession of the equinoxes procession.</v>

2729
02:41:40.230 --> 02:41:40.660
<v 9>Okay.</v>

2730
02:41:40.660 --> 02:41:43.900
<v 0>Um,
I wanna I want to say it's thousands of years,</v>

2731
02:41:43.901 --> 02:41:47.740
but I don't remember the exact 26,000 year cycle.
Wow.

2732
02:41:47.770 --> 02:41:50.590
So they figured out a 26,000 year cycle,

2733
02:41:51.570 --> 02:41:56.570
<v 4>pretty good measurement to see a change year to year.</v>

2734
02:41:57.121 --> 02:41:59.550
That was just one 26000th.

2735
02:41:59.710 --> 02:42:03.930
<v 0>Yeah.
That's one of the ways that these,
um,
a lot of these,
um,</v>

2736
02:42:04.220 --> 02:42:09.220
revisionists of ancient Egyptian history point to the possibility besides the

2737
02:42:10.041 --> 02:42:14.600
erosion of the Sphinx pointed the possibility of the Sphinx is far older than we

2738
02:42:14.601 --> 02:42:19.100
think it is.
Um,
is that at 10,500 BC,

2739
02:42:19.130 --> 02:42:20.930
it was pointing towards the Constellation.

2740
02:42:20.931 --> 02:42:25.730
Leo At this lion was representative of this,

2741
02:42:26.150 --> 02:42:30.470
this constellation that has sort of been universally described as being

2742
02:42:30.471 --> 02:42:32.950
associated with a line because of its shape.
Okay.

2743
02:42:32.990 --> 02:42:36.100
This is the reason why they believe that 10,005,

2744
02:42:36.101 --> 02:42:39.410
both sides of the fact that there's all this water erosion around the sphinx

2745
02:42:39.620 --> 02:42:42.680
that can only be attributed to thousands of years of rainfall.

2746
02:42:42.920 --> 02:42:47.810
And the last time there was rainfall and the Nile Valley was 9,000 BC,

2747
02:42:48.440 --> 02:42:49.560
which they think,
you know,

2748
02:42:49.580 --> 02:42:53.360
they think that they want to attribute to the Sphinx to the same people that

2749
02:42:53.361 --> 02:42:57.470
they believe built the pyramids,
which is about 2,500 BC.

2750
02:42:57.890 --> 02:43:00.770
But they think that actually there might have been many,
many,

2751
02:43:00.771 --> 02:43:02.660
many older kingdoms.

2752
02:43:02.930 --> 02:43:07.040
Like there's hieroglyphs apparently the date back to 34,000 BC.

2753
02:43:07.460 --> 02:43:11.420
I don't know any of this.
Yeah.
They,
they date back as far as their descriptions,

2754
02:43:11.500 --> 02:43:12.160
not as far

2755
02:43:12.160 --> 02:43:13.140
<v 1>as like the actual,
uh,</v>

2756
02:43:13.150 --> 02:43:18.150
carbon dating and that their descriptions of Pharaoh's go back thousands and

2757
02:43:18.700 --> 02:43:20.680
thousands of years.
And so they get to a certain point in time,

2758
02:43:20.681 --> 02:43:24.280
the Egyptologists go,
well,
that was just fiction.
Yeah.
You know,
we'll,
we'll,
we'll,

2759
02:43:24.281 --> 02:43:27.700
we believe in Ramsey's.
We believe in,
you know,
Tut Moses,

2760
02:43:27.701 --> 02:43:30.130
we believe in all these different cats,
but the oldest stuff,

2761
02:43:30.131 --> 02:43:33.520
that was just the more,
yeah.
That was just horse shit made up.
Yeah.

2762
02:43:33.521 --> 02:43:38.521
But if the revisionist historians are correct and the geological evidence is,

2763
02:43:40.771 --> 02:43:43.420
it's really fascinating,
especially when it comes to this,

2764
02:43:43.480 --> 02:43:47.140
like a guy named Doctor Ron Shock,
Robert Schoch,
uh,

2765
02:43:47.200 --> 02:43:50.680
from the university.
Boston University.
Yeah.
Boston University.

2766
02:43:50.681 --> 02:43:54.010
He's a geologist and he's the one who sort of spearheaded this whole thing about

2767
02:43:54.011 --> 02:43:57.340
the sphinx because he's,
um,
he's a geologist and he's like,

2768
02:43:57.341 --> 02:44:02.260
this is clear water erosion around the Sphinx.
And,
um,
they,
uh,

2769
02:44:02.290 --> 02:44:06.400
they think that if that is the case,
then these stones had to be cut way,

2770
02:44:06.401 --> 02:44:10.630
way earlier than 25.
I need to look into all this.
It's fascinating.

2771
02:44:10.660 --> 02:44:14.770
And this procession of the Equinox is this 26,000 year cycle that wobble.

2772
02:44:14.920 --> 02:44:17.950
You know the idea is that the earth spins for folks who don't know what we're

2773
02:44:17.951 --> 02:44:21.040
talking about.
It doesn't spin in a perfect circle.

2774
02:44:21.220 --> 02:44:25.690
It kind of has a little wiggle to it and every 20 well it sort of like a top and

2775
02:44:25.691 --> 02:44:28.300
every 26,000 years that wiggles completed.

2776
02:44:28.450 --> 02:44:33.450
So the sky looks different through the entire 26,000 year cycle.

2777
02:44:33.910 --> 02:44:37.890
Right.
And that's,
that's one of the things that they point to this,

2778
02:44:37.900 --> 02:44:42.900
this constellation Leo at 10,500 BC aligning itself with the Sphinx also

2779
02:44:44.351 --> 02:44:49.351
coincidentally lines up the 10,500 BC lines up pretty close to what they believe

2780
02:44:51.851 --> 02:44:55.690
12,000 years ago was a massive asteroidal impact all over the earth.

2781
02:44:55.720 --> 02:44:58.420
Like this nuclear glass,
I think it's called Triton night,

2782
02:44:59.080 --> 02:45:01.110
you know that stuff that they find the,
the,

2783
02:45:01.111 --> 02:45:05.170
the do core samples and they find it at 12,000 years all over the place.

2784
02:45:05.170 --> 02:45:09.420
Evidence of a big impacts and not just a big but multiple.
Okay.

2785
02:45:09.430 --> 02:45:10.300
Meteor impacts.

2786
02:45:10.320 --> 02:45:15.320
Meteor showers that could have led to the extinction of saber tooth tigers,

2787
02:45:15.551 --> 02:45:19.090
woolly mammoths,
all these different animals that died off at a very sick,

2788
02:45:19.360 --> 02:45:21.520
very similar time period.
60%,

2789
02:45:21.521 --> 02:45:26.350
I think of all land mammals died off during that one time.
Yeah.

2790
02:45:26.410 --> 02:45:30.430
Fasa.
What's,
that's the theory that like humans survived.

2791
02:45:30.550 --> 02:45:33.850
Some did we didn't have as many predators or no,
no.

2792
02:45:33.851 --> 02:45:38.020
The theory is that just this huge interruption of life,

2793
02:45:38.590 --> 02:45:42.280
this massive meteor shower that they found all throughout Europe and Asia,

2794
02:45:42.281 --> 02:45:46.270
this nuclear glass that's very similar to uh,
the,
the uh,

2795
02:45:46.271 --> 02:45:49.720
the type of glass that they find after nuclear detonation tests,

2796
02:45:50.110 --> 02:45:51.640
that this nuclear glass,

2797
02:45:51.641 --> 02:45:56.320
which exists all over the places indicative of massive impacts that something

2798
02:45:56.350 --> 02:45:58.750
happened like,
and it's not in one spot.

2799
02:45:58.751 --> 02:46:01.240
It's multiple spots all over the place at the same time,

2800
02:46:01.600 --> 02:46:05.620
much more likely to be a meteor shower than anything else.
And that,

2801
02:46:05.621 --> 02:46:10.580
that probably was also the cause of the end of the ice age.
And that's what,
uh,

2802
02:46:10.640 --> 02:46:13.610
you know,
at 12,000 years ago,

2803
02:46:14.300 --> 02:46:17.900
more than half of North America was covered in a mile high sheet of ice.

2804
02:46:18.560 --> 02:46:23.360
And so they think that what caused that stuff to rapidly change was most likely

2805
02:46:23.361 --> 02:46:26.570
the same thing that caused this nuclear class to be all over the place,

2806
02:46:27.730 --> 02:46:32.620
which is a big mind fuck and also coincides with when the Sphinx was around

2807
02:46:33.010 --> 02:46:33.731
that,
you know,

2808
02:46:33.731 --> 02:46:37.450
it could be that there was a fairly advanced civilization at that point in time,

2809
02:46:37.600 --> 02:46:40.420
slammed with meteor showers,

2810
02:46:40.540 --> 02:46:44.920
massive amounts of people die and then they sort of have to rebuild and they

2811
02:46:44.950 --> 02:46:47.920
kind of learn like what it took them a few thousand years to get back on their

2812
02:46:47.921 --> 02:46:49.480
feet and writing.
You know,

2813
02:46:49.750 --> 02:46:52.030
a few thousand years later they're building the pyramids again.

2814
02:46:53.370 --> 02:46:55.060
I'll have to look into these stories.

2815
02:46:55.210 --> 02:46:58.750
That sounds really interesting and also it falls right in line with that whole,

2816
02:46:58.751 --> 02:47:00.790
what do you do when you have to start all over again?

2817
02:47:00.791 --> 02:47:04.150
How long does it take to get back up to where you were before?
Yeah,

2818
02:47:04.450 --> 02:47:06.550
well the idea that has been a linear linear progression,

2819
02:47:06.551 --> 02:47:07.900
complete linear progression,

2820
02:47:08.080 --> 02:47:12.940
straight line from caveman to us seems a little silly when you see all the

2821
02:47:12.941 --> 02:47:15.370
impacts that we know for sure happened.
When you know,

2822
02:47:15.371 --> 02:47:18.820
when you look at the Clovis comment,
when you look at all the,
the,
the different,

2823
02:47:19.090 --> 02:47:23.770
the Holocene crater,
all these different impacts that they know happened.

2824
02:47:23.860 --> 02:47:27.550
They know that this,
you know,
look at the moon,
it's Goddamn shooting gallery.

2825
02:47:27.580 --> 02:47:30.220
There's things happen.
And when things do happen,

2826
02:47:30.221 --> 02:47:34.180
all these stories like the Noah's Ark Story,
epic of Gilgamesh,

2827
02:47:34.181 --> 02:47:38.380
all the different cataclysmic events that have been documented through folklore,

2828
02:47:38.740 --> 02:47:40.930
most likely some shit went down.

2829
02:47:41.350 --> 02:47:45.190
And that was the idea that that's what freaks me out about hard drives.
That's,

2830
02:47:45.191 --> 02:47:48.610
it freaks me out about the idea of everything being stored on computers.

2831
02:47:49.920 --> 02:47:50.753
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

2832
02:47:52.120 --> 02:47:55.010
<v 1>Including this podcast,
including this podcast.
Yeah.</v>

2833
02:47:55.330 --> 02:47:59.470
Imagine if someone had to tell this podcast and an oral tradition,

2834
02:48:00.220 --> 02:48:00.670
some of that,

2835
02:48:00.670 --> 02:48:04.900
take the information that we discussed in this podcast and describe it.

2836
02:48:05.150 --> 02:48:05.983
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

2837
02:48:09.610 --> 02:48:12.100
<v 1>Because they couldn't play the file,
but they heard it before.</v>

2838
02:48:12.130 --> 02:48:14.720
They heard it before but then butchered it.
And it wasn't prints.

2839
02:48:14.721 --> 02:48:18.370
It was James Brown and,
and you know,
all the,

2840
02:48:18.940 --> 02:48:23.140
all the various things that we talked about get all screwed up.
Right.

2841
02:48:23.350 --> 02:48:25.990
But still attributed to us.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

2842
02:48:25.991 --> 02:48:28.990
But you would be like some information,
God from the future.

2843
02:48:28.991 --> 02:48:33.991
They'd remember the part about you going into the past and they would butcher

2844
02:48:34.241 --> 02:48:37.240
that.
He who pees a lot.
Yeah,
he's had a problem.

2845
02:48:37.241 --> 02:48:41.870
His bladder wouldn't forget that part.
No.
Yeah.

2846
02:48:41.890 --> 02:48:45.500
If you really stop and think we're in the process of something,

2847
02:48:46.070 --> 02:48:51.060
we're right in the middle or not even,
we're just,
well,
we're in the middle in,

2848
02:48:51.061 --> 02:48:53.570
in that it's going on,
but it's constantly going on.

2849
02:48:54.050 --> 02:48:56.510
It was going on when they were single celled organisms.

2850
02:48:56.511 --> 02:49:00.590
It was going on when the star Supernova to create carbon,

2851
02:49:00.591 --> 02:49:03.050
which created carbon based life,
which created us,

2852
02:49:03.051 --> 02:49:05.690
which created everything that came before us,

2853
02:49:05.691 --> 02:49:08.880
which going to create everything that comes from us.
Yeah.
That would be,

2854
02:49:08.881 --> 02:49:13.530
if I could see something I w I don't think if I had a choice of Chin going a

2855
02:49:13.531 --> 02:49:16.170
million years in the future or a million years in the past,

2856
02:49:16.590 --> 02:49:20.550
it just for a visual glimpse,
a million years of the past is pretty fascinating,

2857
02:49:20.880 --> 02:49:24.600
but a million years in the future to see what a human being looks like a million

2858
02:49:24.600 --> 02:49:28.740
years from now.
Yeah.
That's what I would want.
How different would we be?
We,

2859
02:49:29.850 --> 02:49:30.810
we have,

2860
02:49:33.250 --> 02:49:33.760
<v 5>okay,</v>

2861
02:49:33.760 --> 02:49:38.290
<v 1>we can change our own bodies a lot more now.
Uh,</v>

2862
02:49:38.410 --> 02:49:42.880
and we've made changes unnecessary in a way because we can you,

2863
02:49:42.890 --> 02:49:47.890
we have climate controlled buildings and we have vehicles and we have medical

2864
02:49:48.310 --> 02:49:51.610
care that can keep things the way they are

2865
02:49:54.050 --> 02:49:58.970
better than we'd had 3 million years ago.
Better than we have 300 years ago.

2866
02:49:59.000 --> 02:49:59.833
Yeah.

2867
02:50:00.680 --> 02:50:01.430
<v 5>Okay.</v>

2868
02:50:01.430 --> 02:50:05.420
<v 1>So what does a human going to look like in a million years?
I would guess</v>

2869
02:50:07.010 --> 02:50:11.450
not that different biologically,
but we'll be doing some pretty crazy stuff,

2870
02:50:11.480 --> 02:50:14.470
I would guess.
Radically different.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well,

2871
02:50:14.560 --> 02:50:17.750
I think physically we're very different from people that just lived a couple

2872
02:50:17.750 --> 02:50:20.390
hundred years ago because of nutrition.
Sure.
Look at how tiny people were.

2873
02:50:20.840 --> 02:50:24.880
Oh my God.
That's what's really weird when you see how little folks were.
Yeah.

2874
02:50:24.920 --> 02:50:28.580
Like the average size of people that were fighting in the civil war was like 125

2875
02:50:28.581 --> 02:50:32.210
pounds.
Wow.
That was an average man.
Wow.
There were tiny little dudes,

2876
02:50:32.211 --> 02:50:35.620
like people were like 80 pounds bigger on average now.
Right.

2877
02:50:35.870 --> 02:50:38.240
Which is really pretty substantial.
Yeah.

2878
02:50:38.300 --> 02:50:42.740
But I think that the real change is going to come with our integration of

2879
02:50:42.741 --> 02:50:46.400
technology in our lives [inaudible] and the symbiotic relationship that we have

2880
02:50:46.401 --> 02:50:48.980
with this technology,
which now you leave your phone behind,

2881
02:50:48.981 --> 02:50:53.090
you feel naked eventually it's going to be something much more integrated.
Yeah.

2882
02:50:53.600 --> 02:50:56.150
I think that's where things are going to get really squirrely.
Well,

2883
02:50:56.170 --> 02:51:01.040
I think where people are going to start to become connected inexorably with this

2884
02:51:01.041 --> 02:51:05.250
technology
aliens,
Bro.
That's what we're going to look like.

2885
02:51:05.700 --> 02:51:08.520
We're going to look like aliens does.
Yeah.
Think about it.

2886
02:51:08.521 --> 02:51:12.570
We ruined our atmosphere.
Okay.
We were fucking holes in the ozone layer.

2887
02:51:12.571 --> 02:51:15.810
You need permanent sunglasses,
so what are those big black eyes?

2888
02:51:16.050 --> 02:51:18.150
Those are giant sunglasses are built into your head.

2889
02:51:18.660 --> 02:51:22.890
No longer need to move things physically because we can do things with

2890
02:51:23.670 --> 02:51:24.600
telekinesis.

2891
02:51:24.720 --> 02:51:27.450
We have giant heads because our brains are going to grow the same way.

2892
02:51:27.630 --> 02:51:31.620
The human brain sides double over a period of 2 million years and you know

2893
02:51:32.160 --> 02:51:36.930
ancient proto hominids.
Right.
Our brains are huge compared to our body size.
Yeah.

2894
02:51:37.140 --> 02:51:40.140
I mean,
a whale brain is way bigger than our brain,

2895
02:51:40.170 --> 02:51:43.460
but whales are also huge and they need all,
um,

2896
02:51:43.620 --> 02:51:48.150
all of that for all those extra nerves.
But in our little bodies,

2897
02:51:48.151 --> 02:51:52.020
we've got a huge breaks off the charts.
Yeah.
No.

2898
02:51:52.710 --> 02:51:55.350
And used to be smaller in other,

2899
02:51:55.410 --> 02:52:00.270
other primates and whatever we came became,
you know,
however we became people,

2900
02:52:00.720 --> 02:52:03.690
that doubling of the human brain size is a massive mystery,
right?

2901
02:52:05.350 --> 02:52:07.360
Aliens,
we're going to look like aliens.

2902
02:52:07.600 --> 02:52:11.500
We're going to have these big goofy beach ball heads,
little skinny bodies,

2903
02:52:12.370 --> 02:52:15.950
and going to be able to manipulate manner.
Boy,

2904
02:52:15.951 --> 02:52:17.450
this fucking conversation got stupid.

2905
02:52:17.600 --> 02:52:21.070
I blame me that you were responsible for science and I,

2906
02:52:21.071 --> 02:52:24.830
I took us to the wolf stoner stuff.
I was like,
what?
It,
yeah.
What have we w yeah,

2907
02:52:24.831 --> 02:52:27.650
we wind up looking like aliens.
I think we'll,

2908
02:52:27.651 --> 02:52:32.651
if you think about like a gorilla or an ape or whatever monkey type animal we

2909
02:52:34.401 --> 02:52:38.030
used to be,
and this is big stipulation.
People say,
Oh,
you shouldn't see monkeys.

2910
02:52:38.330 --> 02:52:42.230
You know,
people aren't monkeys or apes.
Uh,
actually,
no,

2911
02:52:42.710 --> 02:52:46.160
we're all monkeys.
This is how it goes.
Um,

2912
02:52:46.490 --> 02:52:51.050
all apes or monkeys,
but not all monkeys or apes.

2913
02:52:51.260 --> 02:52:54.800
Is that true?
I don't know.
Dislike.
All humans are apes,

2914
02:52:54.801 --> 02:52:59.510
but not all apes are humans.
Monkeys,
not a real scientific term.
Ah.

2915
02:52:59.720 --> 02:53:03.890
So when you say something's a monkey,
like,
oh,
monkeys have tails.
No,

2916
02:53:03.891 --> 02:53:05.250
monkeys aren't even real.
They're sending.

2917
02:53:06.230 --> 02:53:10.050
So people who are con who like anal and correct you on that.
Tell him like,

2918
02:53:10.060 --> 02:53:14.720
fuck off,
fuck off.
Grammar.
Police.
You're incorrect.

2919
02:53:14.750 --> 02:53:18.890
I like that.
It's like,
it's like a is a,
um,

2920
02:53:19.820 --> 02:53:23.900
<v 3>what's a vegetable scientifically?
Because really I think vegetables,</v>

2921
02:53:23.901 --> 02:53:27.950
just a made up word for any other part of the plant.
Anything's a vegetable.

2922
02:53:28.160 --> 02:53:30.320
That's not a fruit really.
Yeah.

2923
02:53:30.321 --> 02:53:34.310
Well because fruit has a scientific definition,
right?

2924
02:53:34.311 --> 02:53:38.660
It bears the seeds and it contains the,
you know,
the Inuit,
the energy,
the food,

2925
02:53:38.661 --> 02:53:43.280
the,
the seeds need a,
but a vegetable is just,
you know,
it's the root.

2926
02:53:43.281 --> 02:53:47.480
In some cases it's the leaves.
In another case,
it's the trunk.
And another case,

2927
02:53:47.780 --> 02:53:51.830
what you eat is the vegetable,
right?
Vegetable matter.
Plant matter.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2928
02:53:52.100 --> 02:53:53.810
Yeah.
So again,

2929
02:53:53.811 --> 02:53:57.230
it's like I can't tell you whether it's a vegetable or not.

2930
02:53:57.240 --> 02:54:01.520
Does this go up to like what the chefs,
let's say like tomatoes?
Yeah,

2931
02:54:01.700 --> 02:54:05.420
there's a fruit.
Yeah.
They're fruits.
Bananas or are fruits,
but,

2932
02:54:05.480 --> 02:54:09.320
but modern bananas don't have seeds in there.
They're not fertile.

2933
02:54:09.321 --> 02:54:11.060
They're not going to grow.
You have banana tree.

2934
02:54:11.061 --> 02:54:15.140
So should we still call it a fruit?
Well,
from,
from a culinary perspective,

2935
02:54:15.141 --> 02:54:17.150
it's pretty fruity.
So we'll call it a fruit.

2936
02:54:18.480 --> 02:54:19.030
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

2937
02:54:19.030 --> 02:54:22.840
<v 1>It's fascinating stuff.
We're out of time.
We could do this forever though.</v>

2938
02:54:22.960 --> 02:54:25.510
I think you and I can have these conversations until our heads explode.
Yeah,

2939
02:54:25.511 --> 02:54:28.510
I think so.
Until we become alien.
Until my bladder explodes.
Yeah.

2940
02:54:28.511 --> 02:54:30.250
Your bladder is not that good dude.
You need to work.

2941
02:54:30.251 --> 02:54:33.520
But you drank two big things of water where you're sitting.
Yeah,
I know.
Come on.

2942
02:54:33.521 --> 02:54:34.121
Give me some credit.

2943
02:54:34.121 --> 02:54:39.070
Like I had both of those and I had one before we even started.

2944
02:54:39.340 --> 02:54:43.120
I'm a hydrated guy.
It's very good to be there.
It's very smart.
It's good to be.

2945
02:54:43.180 --> 02:54:47.740
Just this morning my urine was a bit dark.
Oh,
I really,
I was like,
nope.

2946
02:54:47.830 --> 02:54:52.390
Gotta drink some water.
Will you flying in now?
I've been here for a few days.

2947
02:54:52.410 --> 02:54:57.220
Where you boozing it up?
No,
you drinking a lot of coffee.
Yeah.
That could be it.

2948
02:54:57.400 --> 02:55:00.280
Yeah.
Energy drinks to those can really fuck you up.

2949
02:55:00.370 --> 02:55:03.650
Those will really dehydrate and those aren't good.
Yeah.

2950
02:55:03.680 --> 02:55:06.560
Those make me pee more than anything.
I could drink coffee and be fine,

2951
02:55:06.561 --> 02:55:10.490
but if I drink one red bull,
I got to pee.
Yeah.
Fascinating.

2952
02:55:10.760 --> 02:55:14.270
People don't care about my p listen,
but they do care about mine.

2953
02:55:14.300 --> 02:55:18.320
Your Youtube channel is awesome and it's been an honor to have you on the show,

2954
02:55:18.321 --> 02:55:19.640
man.
I really,
really appreciate it.

2955
02:55:19.850 --> 02:55:22.430
It's really cool talking to you honor to be here.
And uh,

2956
02:55:22.880 --> 02:55:27.880
I just think it's so cool that something like what color is a mirror has 10

2957
02:55:28.640 --> 02:55:33.170
million views on youtube.
Yeah.
And that's not,
it's not like a standup routine.

2958
02:55:33.590 --> 02:55:36.410
I really do get into the,
the physics of,

2959
02:55:36.411 --> 02:55:41.411
of reflection and a why the answer is kind of green and it's,

2960
02:55:41.960 --> 02:55:45.860
