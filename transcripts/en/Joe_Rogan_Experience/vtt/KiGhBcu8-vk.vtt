WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.570
[inaudible] are recording to server the fuck outta here.
Server.

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.570
We're playing music that no one's heard.
This shit is

3
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.110
<v 1>Diane.
D aunt word</v>

4
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.840
<v 2>original Max could climb a big fan of that shit.</v>

5
00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:16.400
Take this baby to maximum

6
00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.620
cash but feel

7
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:36.740
free to get back down.

8
00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.950
<v 1>Well,
uh,
just say that,
that,
that's a fucking South African band.</v>

9
00:00:48.951 --> 00:00:50.150
It's Deann or now,

10
00:00:50.151 --> 00:00:53.540
but they were a bunch of different things before they were Deann word.
And uh,

11
00:00:53.541 --> 00:00:55.850
I've been obsessed with them for the last couple of weeks.
Man.

12
00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.180
They're fucking awesome every now and then,
yet you catch a band.
That's the shit.

13
00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.510
Uh,
speaking to the shed,
Freddie Lockhart,
ladies and gentlemen,

14
00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.150
old school comedy road dog,
my friend from many,
many,
many,
many,

15
00:01:08.151 --> 00:01:09.850
many,
many moons ago through that,

16
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.170
back when Freddie was actually working at the comedy store,

17
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.440
Freddie started out the right way.
Like,
uh,

18
00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.670
like so many comedy store warriors have done work in there,
you know,

19
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.350
either doing the door or you know,
work in,
uh,
work in the cover booth.

20
00:01:24.351 --> 00:01:25.400
And you know,
there's,

21
00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.910
that's one of the cool things about the comedy store is that almost everybody

22
00:01:28.911 --> 00:01:33.770
working there is,
wants to be a comic.
Almost everybody working there wants to,

23
00:01:33.771 --> 00:01:36.230
uh,
wants to make it in show business.

24
00:01:36.231 --> 00:01:39.290
There's a lot of people that are great people that work in other clubs,

25
00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.080
but they're not,
they're not there because they want to be comedians.

26
00:01:42.081 --> 00:01:45.380
The comedy store is entirely comprised as people who want to be committed.

27
00:01:45.381 --> 00:01:48.470
And the accountants,
everybody.
Yeah.
Everybody.
It's ridiculous,
unfortunately,

28
00:01:48.471 --> 00:01:51.470
except for the fucking managers.
And that's why the place sucks.
A bag of dicks.

29
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.600
Oh,

30
00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.250
one of the all time classic comedy clubs,
but a CBGBS if you're up to calm,

31
00:01:59.251 --> 00:02:03.170
it's now run by Mitzi shore anymore,
unfortunately.
No.
Um,
but,
uh,

32
00:02:03.171 --> 00:02:04.340
it's still a great fucking place.

33
00:02:04.341 --> 00:02:07.760
And that's where I met Freddy Lockhart Bay back in the design flashlight.

34
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.900
Flashlight is our sponsor.
We have to,
uh,
let everybody know about that.

35
00:02:11.901 --> 00:02:14.540
You could go to Joe rogan.net and buy it.
And if you a,

36
00:02:14.541 --> 00:02:19.430
you click the link and enter in the code name Rogan,
you get 15% off.

37
00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.070
That's what it is.
Right?
Show.
Show him the flashlight.

38
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.700
This is the alien one.
It's blue.
It's got two clips.
Nice.
Put your finger in it.

39
00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.010
A star Trek.
Nobody's fuck this.
I wouldn't do that except me.

40
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.330
I've always wondered.
I was like,
what is it going to feel like?
That's,

41
00:02:35.331 --> 00:02:38.570
that's pretty good.
What do you think?
It's really interesting feeling,
right?

42
00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.890
It definitely feels better than,
well,
probably my rough hands.

43
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.070
You just warm that up on it and I was scratching,

44
00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.780
just warm it up a little and I'll be in Austin,
Texas this weekend,
all weekend,

45
00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.610
Thursday,
Friday and Saturday at Cap City comedy club.
And uh,

46
00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.250
Joey Coco Diaz will be with me.
It's a rare treat that we get to bring Joey

47
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.530
<v 3>on the road.
I think about Joey is Joey.
He's the best.</v>

48
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.840
He's my favorite comedian of all time,

49
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.080
but he's as about as reliable as fucking a fake Rolex.

50
00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.520
It had just like,
you just can't count on them.
I used to,

51
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.440
I started taking people with me.

52
00:03:17.441 --> 00:03:19.970
I only used to bring one opener for the longest time.
Right.

53
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:25.080
But Joey flaked so many times that I started taking a second opener with me just

54
00:03:25.631 --> 00:03:27.110
so that I could still book Joe.
Yeah.
And under.

55
00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.790
So if the shit hit the fan and only hit the family one out of every 20 times,

56
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.450
but it hit the fan every now and then you'd be in Jersey going,

57
00:03:34.451 --> 00:03:37.720
where the fuck are you?
I'm not going to lie to your dog.
I never left Vegas.

58
00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.020
The excuses always admirable and and and in an entertaining at best to get an

59
00:03:44.021 --> 00:03:48.430
excuse,
she might just not get phone calls back.
Yeah,
for like months.

60
00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.220
Black Dog.
And then once you do talk to them,
it never gets brought up.

61
00:03:51.221 --> 00:03:53.530
What up dog?
What are we doing?
What's up Qca clicker.

62
00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.070
I don't want to go back to those days of my life.
So he's going,

63
00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.740
we had a scare today.
I thought that thought it wasn't going to go.

64
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.550
You never know Joey,
anything could happen.
He's always got this,

65
00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.600
I got something going on in dogs.
That Disney channel movie.

66
00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.050
I think it's going to be big.
I get to show my balls,

67
00:04:08.051 --> 00:04:12.340
they're going to blow it out.
Have you seen the previews of his a Disney movie?

68
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:13.150
No,
laser called.

69
00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.640
It's called like the dog that saved Christmas and they released like they're

70
00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.570
releasing like a whole bunch of them in the first one Joey was like 400 pounds

71
00:04:22.571 --> 00:04:25.960
or whatever.
Oh yeah.
And then he lost a lot of ways and sent out.

72
00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.680
They were like really concerned.
But anyways,
I just saw the preview I,
but it's,

73
00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.490
I think it's just about to come on DVD.

74
00:04:30.491 --> 00:04:34.000
I saw the preview and Joey Diaz has a little scene in there where he's in drag

75
00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:35.950
and it's the cutest thing ever.

76
00:04:35.951 --> 00:04:38.860
See what the fuck would they care if you lose a hundred pounds?
He looks better.

77
00:04:38.861 --> 00:04:41.260
He's hitting it looks like he's healthy right into the goddamn.

78
00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.920
That's what they ended up doing.
They wrote in the whole weight watcher thing.

79
00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.720
Is he keeping it off?
He's still keeping the way.

80
00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.130
What does he does weight watchers?
He falls for him.
I got points,

81
00:04:51.131 --> 00:04:55.150
cock sucker and he'll explain it to you with anger in his voice.
Oh,
that's great.

82
00:04:55.151 --> 00:04:58.120
Good for him.
Yeah.
He's like a fucking slice of pizza and a coke.

83
00:04:58.121 --> 00:05:01.150
That's eight points.
You can't take eight point cock sucker.

84
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.240
You deserve to be fat.
They'll get fucking angry.

85
00:05:04.241 --> 00:05:06.550
He like gets very passionate about his weight watchers,

86
00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.490
but yet when I go out to eat,
he'll be like,
fuck,

87
00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.350
this is only for weight watcher points.
I'm like,
dude,

88
00:05:11.351 --> 00:05:15.790
that's not shows with salmon,
salmon,
snickers.
How many points is that?
Oh,

89
00:05:15.791 --> 00:05:18.510
it's like,
you know,
80 point like your home.

90
00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.300
Is that supposed to be your whole day?
So what did he lose?

91
00:05:22.301 --> 00:05:24.750
He lost a hundred pounds on your fucking pants.
Pretty fucking.
Yeah,

92
00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.300
he put it together.
Especially not doing the lap band or the Castro.

93
00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:33.400
He will old school way.
He got really upset about that too.
You know,

94
00:05:33.401 --> 00:05:35.320
we would talk about it.
He goes,
I'm not going to do it.
Talk.

95
00:05:35.321 --> 00:05:38.700
I'm not going to do it.
He got like real passionate about,
he goes by [inaudible].

96
00:05:38.701 --> 00:05:42.700
He's had that fucking thing.
He blew it out twice.
So surgeries,

97
00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.180
I'm not going to get cut open bro.
I'm going to get fucking cuddle.
Right.

98
00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.620
You just,
he manned up and up and he fucking lost the weight.
It's incredible.

99
00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.090
Well,
the thing with those things too,
it's like your,

100
00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.970
your brain doesn't catch up with what has happened to your body.

101
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.980
You know what I mean?
It's like that's part of the whole working it process,
you

102
00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.090
<v 1>know?
Yeah.</v>

103
00:05:59.091 --> 00:06:03.020
You can't just fucking rewire your body and then your brain is still jack.

104
00:06:03.021 --> 00:06:07.780
This need constant need for food.
You didn't pick time.
It's an obsession,
man.

105
00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:11.870
The people become so,
it's so easy for people to get obsessed with things.
For me,

106
00:06:11.871 --> 00:06:15.470
I can get obsessed with cute tips,
putting q-tips in my ears.

107
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.980
I can get obsessed with video games.
I get obsessed with beating off.

108
00:06:18.981 --> 00:06:22.190
I can get obsessed with things where they're like just like consume me.

109
00:06:22.191 --> 00:06:25.250
Like I have to do though.
What the fuck?

110
00:06:25.251 --> 00:06:30.140
Kind of a flaw is that share what a goofy ass flaw.
It's sucks to.

111
00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:33.740
It's,
we all have I,
it's not the food one.
Right,
exactly.

112
00:06:33.741 --> 00:06:36.860
It's like mine was always like the weed one,
you know,
the sleeping one.

113
00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:40.430
It could be bad things,
but I just at least smart enough to say,
you know,

114
00:06:40.431 --> 00:06:42.080
to not deny the addiction.
Just to know.

115
00:06:42.081 --> 00:06:44.960
It could get out of hand if I gave into it.
You gotta be careful,
you know,

116
00:06:44.961 --> 00:06:48.050
respect the beast in there.
You know you gotta be very careful.

117
00:06:48.051 --> 00:06:51.320
It's like due to use to smoke cigarettes,
I'm just going to have one cigarette

118
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:56.630
in a wrestling match right here with the devil.

119
00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.610
He's going to tie you up bitch.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You're,
you're,
you're screwed with that.

120
00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:03.920
You fucked up.
I just,
I just complete out and out say a for it.

121
00:07:03.921 --> 00:07:05.510
It's like the video games,
the grand theft auto.

122
00:07:05.511 --> 00:07:07.700
I got so addicted to it like my life was,

123
00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:12.260
I was literally dreaming and thinking and grant and my mindset would be like,

124
00:07:12.261 --> 00:07:15.940
oh just take that cop's car and Jack and then we'll get to,

125
00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:18.650
we'll get to the gig quicker.
Like I'm like real life.

126
00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:22.230
That's my subconscious mind.
But luckily in my conscious mind is like no,
you,

127
00:07:22.231 --> 00:07:26.480
you know there's eight that rewires kids and mixing it with him.

128
00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.030
I used to play this game where you jumped from building to building.

129
00:07:29.031 --> 00:07:32.780
I forget which game at [inaudible] city of heroes and after I played it for like

130
00:07:32.781 --> 00:07:36.050
a month straight for like 10 hours a day,
I would go outside and forget,

131
00:07:36.051 --> 00:07:38.530
I can't jump on top of buildings like I was just driving going,

132
00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:41.030
I can jump on that building and that building.
I'm like,
what am I thinking?

133
00:07:41.031 --> 00:07:44.840
And it's very Darwinian.
If you're a kid now,
if you're a kid,

134
00:07:44.841 --> 00:07:47.930
you haven't laid down those those at least those deep rooted thoughts and will

135
00:07:47.931 --> 00:07:50.450
tell you that you know you can't do that.
That little voice that says no,

136
00:07:50.451 --> 00:07:53.480
don't kill him.
It's like you don't have physical limitation.

137
00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:56.300
The law doesn't even hold you accountable until you're eight years old for

138
00:07:56.301 --> 00:07:57.830
murder or something like that.
So think about that.

139
00:07:57.831 --> 00:08:01.370
If you're playing those video games and your four or five,
that's all you know.

140
00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:04.250
You don't think he just pulled the trigger.
Especially boys,
you,
you,

141
00:08:04.251 --> 00:08:06.530
when you have little girls,
you see them around a little boys.

142
00:08:06.531 --> 00:08:10.790
You realize how fucking crazy boys are from the get go.
Like VR.

143
00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:14.600
There are a lot of the things that are fucked up about human beings because of

144
00:08:14.601 --> 00:08:17.390
our culture,
but there's a lot of shit that's just in there,
man.

145
00:08:17.391 --> 00:08:20.030
When you see like little boys and this little boy,

146
00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:22.730
there was two little two year old babies in this,

147
00:08:22.731 --> 00:08:27.650
this big inflatable play thing and won like seven,
eight year old boy.

148
00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:28.910
Okay.
And a seven,

149
00:08:28.911 --> 00:08:33.911
eight year old boy was fucking throwing himself through the air and crashing

150
00:08:34.251 --> 00:08:37.600
into the walls.
This thing with no regard to these babies that were around them.

151
00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:40.820
It was such a trip to watch and I was watching him like,
dude,

152
00:08:40.821 --> 00:08:41.720
you got to settle down.

153
00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:44.840
You got to sell down and you're looking at them like he can't even help himself.

154
00:08:44.841 --> 00:08:49.760
This kid is wired up with his fucking chimpanzee DNA.
I mean,
he's like six man.

155
00:08:49.761 --> 00:08:52.640
He's just throwing himself into the cage of this thing.

156
00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:56.160
They are there in grand that where they're crazy to get that shit out.

157
00:08:56.161 --> 00:08:56.881
It's inside of them.

158
00:08:56.881 --> 00:09:01.080
If you take a kid like that and don't exercise that it should be a crime.

159
00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:05.760
It should be a crime to have a little male monster and not work it out.
Yeah,

160
00:09:05.761 --> 00:09:08.400
you gotta you gotta treat him just like a dog.

161
00:09:08.401 --> 00:09:09.850
Give him a ball and make them go chase it to,

162
00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:12.340
when I first started doing wrestling in high school,

163
00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:17.040
I first started like really working out a real cause.
Like I used to,

164
00:09:17.041 --> 00:09:19.460
I did martial arts before that,
but quite honestly the,

165
00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:22.830
the karate class than I did before wrestling.
It wasn't good.

166
00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.770
It wasn't like it wasn't hard enough to really break.

167
00:09:25.771 --> 00:09:30.650
You are wrestling practice would break,
break,
make you question yourself and,

168
00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:34.640
but you get out of there though and you're so peaceful.
Oh yeah.

169
00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:36.600
Like there's nothing left.
Absolutely.
You don't,

170
00:09:36.601 --> 00:09:40.110
you don't need to get upset about some asshole who cuts in front of you.

171
00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:43.800
The red light,
it's all like whatever.
I would see those guys in high school.

172
00:09:43.801 --> 00:09:46.320
I played football and it was,
the thing is it was only hard for two weeks.

173
00:09:46.321 --> 00:09:49.230
Hell Week.
The beginning of summer,
especially in Arizona,
it's hot as hell,

174
00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:51.540
but the higher you went up and Varsity,

175
00:09:51.541 --> 00:09:53.600
it was so easy because they didn't want anybody to get hurt.

176
00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:55.950
Nobody was going into freshman football.
You had to hit the biggest gun.

177
00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:58.110
They didn't care.
They just size to anybody against anybody,

178
00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.810
but it would watch the wrestlers go back to the locker room.

179
00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:03.240
After we went back to the locker room,
I was like,
those guys just,
I mean,

180
00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:06.800
they were just,
they would just lay there,
there'd be drenched Brodo,
but they,

181
00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:10.230
you never saw them on campus during the meat head crap that we were doing.

182
00:10:10.231 --> 00:10:11.820
The football players,
they were exhausted.

183
00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:15.570
They're exhausted and they do get humbled to and they knew that they could,

184
00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:19.080
they could end this situation a lot quicker than we could,
you know of.

185
00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:21.290
There's also,
they get it out of their system.
Yeah.

186
00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:24.360
If you're always competing with men and you're always like throwing yourself in

187
00:10:24.361 --> 00:10:24.451
there,

188
00:10:24.451 --> 00:10:28.350
you don't want to do anything and it's like you're doing it and it's the safest

189
00:10:28.351 --> 00:10:30.780
way to do it and deal with your biology,

190
00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:33.840
what you're doing as you're doing it in a controlled environment with a bunch of

191
00:10:33.841 --> 00:10:37.530
other people who agree to it and it's honorable and you do it like you tap each

192
00:10:37.531 --> 00:10:39.780
other out and there's not even any hard feelings.
Right.
It's like,

193
00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.520
well you're like,
when you do Jujitsu,

194
00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:44.660
there's no hard feelings when God's get got,
you know,
somebody taps you out,

195
00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:46.950
you go,
that's what happens.
You get caught.
What did I do wrong?

196
00:10:46.951 --> 00:10:49.690
Did I put my arm through?
Oh,
I fucked up.
I forgot to put the arm here.

197
00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:51.840
I thank you.
Thank you.
And you go back again.
It's like,

198
00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:57.020
but you get all this ingrained male dominator shit out of your system that's

199
00:10:57.071 --> 00:11:00.750
opposed to live all like hanging out like this.
Oh yeah.
Chimps,

200
00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:02.460
you know like you,
you know,

201
00:11:02.461 --> 00:11:06.180
chimps don't like hang out that much ripped off other chimps.

202
00:11:06.181 --> 00:11:08.520
Like if they go meet other champs,
like they have like little tribes.

203
00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:11.610
I saw me to their ships.
They're fighting.
They're,
yeah,

204
00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:14.130
they're fucking fighting big for sure.
That did the death.

205
00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:17.160
Sometimes they creep over and they don't even know these champs is Jakob.

206
00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:19.290
They just decide who's in the team and that's it.

207
00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:22.250
But we've got to deal with so many people all day long.

208
00:11:22.251 --> 00:11:23.550
You can't just jack people,

209
00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:27.630
but those signals are still present in like ghostly form in your brain.

210
00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:30.300
That's why.
That's why my dick on youtube videos,

211
00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:35.880
I will lay.
What do you mean?
I'm just kidding.

212
00:11:35.881 --> 00:11:38.590
I'm not a dick.
I know it's true.

213
00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:43.440
It's like message boards watching people around message boards and psychosis and

214
00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:44.700
I'm,
I'm always like,
all right,

215
00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:47.790
if we are talking about something in a room together,

216
00:11:47.791 --> 00:11:51.390
all in a group and you're the person saying they're like this person's fat.

217
00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:54.130
Oh God,
this person sucks.
That's so stupid.
I'm like,

218
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:56.740
<v 3>are you gonna be sitting there going,
yeah,
listen to that guy.
No,</v>

219
00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:58.840
you're going to be doing the same thing you do on a message board where it's

220
00:11:58.841 --> 00:12:00.530
just like,
what's wrong with this?
Psycho crazy.

221
00:12:00.531 --> 00:12:04.780
Since we had a social face that we put on for social issues,
but at home,

222
00:12:04.781 --> 00:12:05.920
that's maybe who you really are.

223
00:12:05.921 --> 00:12:09.370
The you're saying on youtube fall been out with someone who's barely keeping it

224
00:12:09.371 --> 00:12:13.630
together.
Just like,
yeah.
Nice jets,
great shirt.
Like,
wow,

225
00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:16.450
why don't you just shut up my shirt?
You know,

226
00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:21.520
they just boiling under the skin around,
did you match this unsolicited?

227
00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:24.550
They do the thing where they,
they take a left turn when they see your reaction,

228
00:12:24.551 --> 00:12:27.070
like what the fuck?
And they're like,
oh no,
no,
no.
Yeah,
yeah,
I'm kidding.

229
00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:29.090
It just like,
I'm not that mean.
Yeah.

230
00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:32.620
There's a bunch of dudes who just like to get douchey with dudes.

231
00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:37.330
They just didn't want to get out of the fucking system.
Dare you Brian.

232
00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:42.520
It's funny,
the other day I called Freddy and he called me back and said,
sorry,

233
00:12:42.521 --> 00:12:45.250
I just woke up and I looked at the clock.
I was like,
oh,
it's two 30

234
00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:50.200
they had already ended.
It's the real shit.
He's rocking it,
man.

235
00:12:50.201 --> 00:12:55.010
He's a fucking comic.
Well,
he's an artist.
Chow Tommy.
Let me hear it.

236
00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:59.190
It's not just that.
Okay.
Have you been talking to Mitzi?
Wow.

237
00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:03.760
Mitsui and I did talk and you can work out in the belly room,

238
00:13:03.761 --> 00:13:07.660
Joe Chi.
But that's it for right now.
Wow.
What an honor.

239
00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:11.750
How often you rubber feet.
Wow.
It's not just,

240
00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:15.120
okay because Richard Pryor.
Yes.
Robert [inaudible].

241
00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:22.540
Freddy Lockhart,
by the way,
used to be on the Frank Kelly endo shown is,

242
00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:25.880
in my opinion,
one of the best impression of south.
There you,

243
00:13:25.881 --> 00:13:29.940
you do impressions that are very weird,
man.
You do some impressions that uh,

244
00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:33.220
no one else does.
That's,
I figured that that's what you should do.

245
00:13:33.221 --> 00:13:37.030
I always figured it's like,
why get in and do something.
The Nicholson,

246
00:13:37.031 --> 00:13:41.080
the ones like that,
it's like,
I try to find a strange one and I do it like I see,

247
00:13:41.081 --> 00:13:44.140
man,
don't nobody do ice tea punch of pitches.

248
00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:49.510
I do it better than I to t man.
Not Too with voiceover work and what not.

249
00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:53.350
I love to say what not.
Do you know the Lisbon,
everything.

250
00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:56.140
I try to make a little list there and he fights a little lift,

251
00:13:56.141 --> 00:13:58.690
but it's kind of gangster and it works for him.
You know what I'm saying?

252
00:13:58.720 --> 00:13:59.553
Cause it's dig it.

253
00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:04.120
I used to do that at the comedy store.

254
00:14:04.121 --> 00:14:07.360
I used to call the comedy stories ice tea and this poor guy,
Kenny Tenney,

255
00:14:07.361 --> 00:14:09.700
this guy used to work the phones there.
Do you remember this guy?

256
00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:13.990
He was Mitsis Pool Guy and there was something,
something was off with him.

257
00:14:13.991 --> 00:14:16.090
Definitely say,
I mean,
I don't want to say what he had,

258
00:14:16.091 --> 00:14:19.960
but he definitely wasn't one of,
you know,
he wasn't thinking right but he was,

259
00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:23.530
he was like,
he got uh,
he made money.
He,
he had a pool company,

260
00:14:23.531 --> 00:14:24.970
he cleaned pulls and he did it well,

261
00:14:24.971 --> 00:14:27.130
but he'd function like an eight year old and a,

262
00:14:27.131 --> 00:14:29.970
I would call him every time he would pick up the phone,

263
00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:32.620
I would call them and it would be ice tea and he would fall for it every time.

264
00:14:32.621 --> 00:14:35.320
But like,
Yo man,
I'm bringing 30 people in tonight,
man.

265
00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:40.080
What you got on my booth that you would
like?
I miss you too.

266
00:14:40.081 --> 00:14:43.840
We don't have a booth at six 30 I'm like,
you better build one for me.
Well,

267
00:14:43.841 --> 00:14:46.120
I'll see if we can,
I'm just like,
ah.

268
00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:49.930
That's how it would brush up on the impression as if I could full Kenny Tenney.

269
00:14:50.650 --> 00:14:54.890
I felt like it was golden.
Oh yeah.
How do you,
do you work in presidency?

270
00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:58.250
You practice them at home and then eventually bring on this stage or do you know

271
00:14:58.251 --> 00:15:00.820
when you hear somebody whether or not you can do it?
You know,
I,

272
00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:03.800
there's a lot of people,
if you hear them right away,
I know I could do,

273
00:15:03.801 --> 00:15:04.231
if somebody had,

274
00:15:04.231 --> 00:15:06.560
it tends to have a deeper voice or something like that or if there's a weird

275
00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:11.240
thing about them,
I know I can do it,
but I always more so than the way it sounds,

276
00:15:11.241 --> 00:15:14.420
it's the way somebody looks when they talk because people move their mouth a

277
00:15:14.421 --> 00:15:16.320
certain way.
That will reveal happy breath.

278
00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:19.790
Notice you did that with the Obama thing,
that Obama thing.

279
00:15:19.791 --> 00:15:23.450
I watched it online where they took some footage from like the 70s it looks like

280
00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:27.300
and inserted your clips.
Right.
That was great stuff,
man.
Yeah.

281
00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:29.540
Really do a good Obama.
It was a,

282
00:15:29.541 --> 00:15:32.990
that was a show in Super Lux said Internet series I had,
but the whole thing was,

283
00:15:32.991 --> 00:15:36.500
uh,
I,
I would take facts and skew them a little.
I love time.

284
00:15:36.501 --> 00:15:40.190
Traveling is my biggest obsession,
so that's fine.
Yeah,
I'm obsessed with it.

285
00:15:40.191 --> 00:15:42.080
I'm working on a show right now about time travel.

286
00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:44.930
And you're talking to the right guy.
I'm talking tacky on particles,

287
00:15:44.931 --> 00:15:48.710
the whole thing.
I'm into it,
man.
Who?
Ronald Maladies?
Do you know the whole story?

288
00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:51.050
No,
no,
no.
Fuck.
Is he a traveler?

289
00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:57.610
I love time travel to Ronald Malate is the premier expert in America on Tom

290
00:15:58.370 --> 00:15:59.500
Travel.
And this is the crazy part about,

291
00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:01.430
and we've talked to him on the essay about him on the show before,
but I'm gonna,

292
00:16:01.431 --> 00:16:04.040
I'm gonna bring it up again just cause it's such a fascinating story.

293
00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:06.440
The dude's like a fucking Spiderman comic book.
Okay.

294
00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:09.440
His Dad died when he was a child,
so he became obsessed.

295
00:16:09.441 --> 00:16:12.050
He loved his dad and became upstairs and read about him.

296
00:16:12.051 --> 00:16:15.320
I know exactly what he's like to see a black guy.
He has a black black.
Okay.

297
00:16:15.321 --> 00:16:16.550
Yeah sure.

298
00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:20.180
And he developed and isn't it funny that we have to say he's a black guy?

299
00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:23.450
But that's why I was like,
cause I was excited about it all.
He was black,

300
00:16:23.451 --> 00:16:27.430
super powerful.
You know?
Uh,
like Neil degrasse Tyson.
Yeah.
Those kind of guys.

301
00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:30.810
He's only a few of this son died.
You know his father,
Father Guy.

302
00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:35.150
Here's his story.
His father die.
Brian,
how dare you.

303
00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:38.870
Was he robbing a place so white to the way you say it?

304
00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:43.480
You just smelly cheese,
convenience store.
They were,

305
00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:45.080
they were in the baseball together.
Him and his old man,

306
00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:46.400
they left the club cards and stuff.

307
00:16:46.401 --> 00:16:48.620
So his whole life became obsessed with time travel.

308
00:16:48.621 --> 00:16:50.600
Cause you want to go back in time and save his dad,
right?

309
00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:52.490
Oh it's fucking trippy shit.
What did,

310
00:16:52.491 --> 00:16:56.390
the guy has a peer reviewed paper that he wrote on time travel with.

311
00:16:56.391 --> 00:17:00.140
They were physicists agree like theoretically this all makes sense.

312
00:17:00.141 --> 00:17:02.480
If you can develop this kind of power,
you could go back in time.

313
00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:05.690
Right now we can't develop the kind of power that's necessary to do it,
but,

314
00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:08.090
right.
But that's trippy shit.
I think he didn't,

315
00:17:08.091 --> 00:17:12.440
he isn't he currently building a light thing that he's trying to send the light?

316
00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:16.310
Yeah.
Light literally back in time.
And it makes sense what he's saying.
And I was,

317
00:17:16.311 --> 00:17:19.490
I actually,
when I spoke on that,
I was excited because I thought,
you know,

318
00:17:19.491 --> 00:17:21.230
time travel.
I always thought it'd be possible.

319
00:17:21.231 --> 00:17:23.060
My mom worked at NASA when I was a little kid and that,

320
00:17:23.061 --> 00:17:26.060
I think that's where the curiosity started when I lived at Edwards Air Force

321
00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:26.061
Base,

322
00:17:26.061 --> 00:17:30.140
they were always texting like testing ex jets and crazy shit that the government

323
00:17:30.141 --> 00:17:30.974
was working on,

324
00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:34.250
which just made me knew that they're really aware of shit that we had no idea

325
00:17:34.251 --> 00:17:36.830
about.
And that's when I kind of got an a timetable and I thought,
you know,

326
00:17:36.831 --> 00:17:39.500
you could future time travel,
just manipulation of time.

327
00:17:39.501 --> 00:17:43.190
Basically you stay above the earth's atmosphere at a mile or go gazillion miles

328
00:17:43.191 --> 00:17:46.450
an hour.
You'll come back and you'll have lost time.
You know,
you'll be here,

329
00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:49.830
you'll be ahead,
you'll be still 30 but everyone will be a hundred years old.

330
00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:50.250
Right.

331
00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:50.911
<v 1>So I was doing that,</v>

332
00:17:50.911 --> 00:17:53.580
but I got really excited when I read his article that you could go back in the

333
00:17:53.581 --> 00:17:57.100
past like wait a second,
you can,
you can do that.
You know you can take,

334
00:17:57.350 --> 00:18:01.000
it could only go back to the moment.
The first time machine machine was invented.

335
00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:02.233
That's just the,

336
00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:05.760
I had this argument with Brian and Christie about this and the whole thing about

337
00:18:05.761 --> 00:18:08.190
time travel.
It's like doesn't time.
Once it's exposed,

338
00:18:08.191 --> 00:18:11.100
isn't it all a moot point after that?
You know what I mean?

339
00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:13.350
But that's what they talk about.
What the grandfather clause.

340
00:18:13.351 --> 00:18:15.210
If you go back and you shoot your grandfather,

341
00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:18.240
then that makes it impossible for you to time travel.
But that doesn't,

342
00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:21.590
because I think that just means you break time.
They did not,

343
00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:24.480
didn't take that operate in day.
That option under consideration.

344
00:18:24.481 --> 00:18:27.480
When people talk about that story,
the grandfather paradox,
they always say,
well,

345
00:18:27.481 --> 00:18:29.280
if you did go back in time,

346
00:18:29.281 --> 00:18:32.580
he'd kill your grandfather before your father was ever born for you would never

347
00:18:32.581 --> 00:18:37.020
exist to make the time machine,
but that doesn't mean you couldn't do that.
Right?

348
00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:38.460
You could still do that.
People say,

349
00:18:38.461 --> 00:18:40.820
well that means you couldn't have a time machine.
We,
yeah,
you could.
Yeah,

350
00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:41.251
you could.

351
00:18:41.251 --> 00:18:45.390
You would just do that and then you break everything like a parallel life,

352
00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:49.230
like kind of like back to the [inaudible] to 1955 who want to become string

353
00:18:49.231 --> 00:18:52.350
theory.
It goes off into another world that believe,

354
00:18:52.351 --> 00:18:54.930
and this is a a very strange theory,

355
00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:58.260
but it might be just as real as the one we live in,

356
00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:02.520
that they believe that every second you live your life,
every,

357
00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:07.170
every decision you make,
everything you do,
all the energy that he puts out,

358
00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:11.340
guides you into various parallel dimensions.

359
00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:16.020
And now we are not just living in one dimension that we are living in in an

360
00:19:16.021 --> 00:19:18.630
infinite number of dimensions that are all around us all the time.

361
00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:23.550
And we can choose to slide through these dimensions with our thoughts.
Oh Wow.

362
00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:26.430
Is it as you live your life,
as you live your life correctly,

363
00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:29.820
as you live your life in the direction that you want to do with little

364
00:19:29.821 --> 00:19:34.410
procrastination focused and love and joy as you do this correctly,

365
00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:38.010
you move through higher and higher dimension.
Well that's a,

366
00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:41.340
they all exist all around too much with Buddhism teaches two and then the whole

367
00:19:41.341 --> 00:19:44.760
pot.
And even with the,
like the,
the Yogis,
they know about that and,
and you know,

368
00:19:44.761 --> 00:19:47.310
through meditation and plan travel,
they know about that.

369
00:19:47.311 --> 00:19:48.980
I mean you can't say they know.
They can't say.

370
00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:53.730
It's an idea that western science has come along and started to pick a path and

371
00:19:53.731 --> 00:19:57.090
ask why.
You know in the line the things in the brain that that make it possible.

372
00:19:57.091 --> 00:19:58.920
Did you guys see the thing on CNN last week,

373
00:19:58.921 --> 00:20:02.580
but the alleged time traveler lady with the silicone.
That's nonsense.

374
00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:07.680
There are crazy people.
People aren't even paying attention.
They,
they asked.

375
00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:10.350
They had hearing aids back then.
Right?
Exactly right.
Yeah.

376
00:20:10.351 --> 00:20:13.470
What's crazy is that video became big and then the next day all the places were

377
00:20:13.471 --> 00:20:16.800
like,
no,
it's just a hearing aid,
but yet I still get emails everyday from people,

378
00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:19.830
Twitter messages all day.
It's time to drove a real,
yeah,

379
00:20:19.831 --> 00:20:24.831
there's cell phone towers in 1910 how is this fucking phone works?

380
00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:29.340
Who's this punk calling with this bitch calling the future?

381
00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:32.250
She's calling from the past to the future because otherwise it's not a fucking

382
00:20:32.251 --> 00:20:36.090
phone for her to be calling more realistic.
If she was just like staring,

383
00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:38.860
editors are impressed by someone holding their ear up to their day.
Well,
the,

384
00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:39.950
yeah,
that one was just a,

385
00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:43.050
they wanted to throw it out there and they knew that they couldn't back it up.

386
00:20:43.051 --> 00:20:47.070
Like CNN ran it and it was like
running that.

387
00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:48.070
It was

388
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:48.903
<v 3>the front page.</v>

389
00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:53.740
So that's so stupid and distracting and you know,
I,

390
00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:55.510
as much as I love time travel is like,
come on,

391
00:20:55.511 --> 00:20:58.900
don't make a mockery of time travel by,
by showing crap like that.

392
00:20:58.901 --> 00:21:00.990
That's what really sucks.
Think about if you could even times help,

393
00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:02.800
you could go to the 80s and whip out your iPhone.

394
00:21:02.801 --> 00:21:06.610
You'd get arrested for witchcraft or I mean they would stomp you to death that

395
00:21:06.611 --> 00:21:10.180
they saw that the boys have done.
If you go 10 years ago,
that would happen too.

396
00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:13.120
You know what I mean?
It's like the way technology,
I think in our lifetime,

397
00:21:13.121 --> 00:21:18.040
like this kid's not gay.
It's true.
It's like the kids today,

398
00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:21.860
we're closer to kids who grew up in like the 1940s we're close to the cave men.

399
00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:24.190
Exactly the way things have changed.

400
00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:27.790
I'm watching kids today growing up with porn from the get go.

401
00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:30.320
These kids are like 13 they're taken in the ass.

402
00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:32.490
I think that would be supposed to do,
you know

403
00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:36.850
it's the chickens have come home to roost.

404
00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:40.090
All those shitty parents out there that make porn stars.

405
00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:44.780
All those shitty parents have infected other people's kids as well to porn porn

406
00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:45.650
on their playstation,

407
00:21:46.050 --> 00:21:49.150
taking pictures that pussies and chance sending them throughout class.

408
00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:52.210
People are,
kids are filthy today.
Dirty little fucks.

409
00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:56.020
I was cleaning my laptop out last night going through all this shit just trying

410
00:21:56.021 --> 00:21:59.260
to make room for it cause it's just crazy crowded and I'm just going through all

411
00:21:59.261 --> 00:22:03.130
these videos and I found out that like if you have the mail app and you have

412
00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:04.690
like a Gmail account on there,

413
00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:09.760
it will download everything from your Gmail account.
Every video,
every photo.

414
00:22:09.761 --> 00:22:11.260
At least that's the setting I had.

415
00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:13.210
And so it was like where's all my hard drive space?

416
00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:14.410
So I'm going through all this shit.

417
00:22:14.411 --> 00:22:16.750
And there was videos that people had sent me that message.

418
00:22:16.751 --> 00:22:20.170
It went to spam folders,
you know,
like crazy videos and like,
you know,

419
00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:24.100
just spam videos and stuff.
One of them was this woman where they're taking that.

420
00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:28.180
You've all seen this where the the funnel with the putting the eels and the

421
00:22:28.181 --> 00:22:32.200
woman and then it starts shooting out like salmon.
I'm showing my,

422
00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:36.490
this girl I just met,
I'm like doing this and she looks over.
She goes,

423
00:22:36.491 --> 00:22:39.820
what the fuck are you looking at?
I don't know,

424
00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:42.790
but that's just crazy to think like somebody sent me that video.

425
00:22:42.850 --> 00:22:45.460
If I ever lose my laptop and like the FBI goes,
hey,

426
00:22:45.461 --> 00:22:47.230
let's go see what's in this laptop.
Oh,

427
00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:50.980
he has videos of young girl with salmon is coming out of their ass.
Oh my God.
No.

428
00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:54.880
Was when the girl,
no,
I'm not saying salmon's are big.
I'm not saying that.

429
00:22:54.881 --> 00:22:58.460
I'm just saying what I was going to say,
that stream.

430
00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:02.080
But that video exists on my laptop and that would be knowing is what I'm talking

431
00:23:02.081 --> 00:23:05.950
about.
You know,
it could be anything.
It could be child porn,
it could be any.

432
00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:08.950
That's what I'm saying.
But that was kind of scary.
So fuck the mail APP.

433
00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:10.200
Well that's the thing too.
It's like,

434
00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:13.540
it's like that the sensitized think if you're in in third grade and you see that

435
00:23:13.541 --> 00:23:16.870
like you know around fifth grade we,
we'd get a,
Debbie does Dallas tape.

436
00:23:16.871 --> 00:23:18.120
Somebody's dad would have it,

437
00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:21.580
somebody would have the balls to gang kit while his old man was drunk and they

438
00:23:21.581 --> 00:23:22.810
would pass around eighth grade.

439
00:23:22.811 --> 00:23:26.260
You know like everybody got to see it and you put it back and you gave it back

440
00:23:26.261 --> 00:23:29.320
to the kid.
But that was,
that was pretty much born then.
And it's like now.
Yeah,

441
00:23:29.321 --> 00:23:32.480
they can look at it on their cell phone.
In class I iPhones.
Yeah.

442
00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:37.150
I phones get the html five is like the standard for porn sites now because,

443
00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:40.160
because the iPhone is don't use flat.
So all these points,

444
00:23:40.161 --> 00:23:43.330
I just switched into html five and you can watch a show on your iPhone.

445
00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:46.340
What would a gangster that was on Steve jobs

446
00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:49.530
<v 1>part too is gags and he goes,
he goes,
you know what?</v>

447
00:23:49.531 --> 00:23:52.700
I won't put flat plastic needs to catch up with me.
I mean,
that was just like,

448
00:23:52.701 --> 00:23:56.840
that was just like [inaudible] 85% of the animated websites on the Internet use

449
00:23:56.841 --> 00:23:58.720
it.
He's like,
no man,
no.

450
00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:01.320
<v 4>Back in the day when you liked a girl,
you would like,
Hey,</v>

451
00:24:01.321 --> 00:24:04.260
meet me at the big toy and I'll finger you or touch your boobs are stuff.

452
00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:05.730
Nowadays they're just like,
hey,

453
00:24:05.731 --> 00:24:09.240
go to the bathroom and finger your pussy and I'm going to go into the bathroom

454
00:24:09.241 --> 00:24:12.050
and finger my Dick and then we're going to facetime it.

455
00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:15.600
We're going to facetime it on the third grade.
Why Fi network?
You know?

456
00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:19.200
Can you imagine what these kids are doing nowadays with like facetime and kids

457
00:24:19.201 --> 00:24:21.120
and stuff?
It should also,

458
00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:24.870
it should also honestly make for some really smart fucking kid.
So if they,

459
00:24:24.871 --> 00:24:28.130
if they use the knowledge,
there's going to be some smart fucking kid,

460
00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:32.160
it'll be so much more aware of it.
Yeah,
they're going to be much,

461
00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:33.023
much more advanced.

462
00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:37.370
<v 1>So it one thing at that age,
I didn't know a damn thing and I was 18 I was,</v>

463
00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:38.220
I had,

464
00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:41.480
I get very uncomfortable around people who were religious because I thought

465
00:24:41.481 --> 00:24:42.560
maybe they knew something.

466
00:24:42.561 --> 00:24:44.570
I thought maybe they were in on something and they were like,

467
00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:47.000
they were like more powerful.
Oh Wow.
I believed it.

468
00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:50.900
I thought when I was 18 that's a fucking dumb.
I like,
I wasn't,

469
00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:53.120
I was religious when I was younger and then when I was 18,
I was like,

470
00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:56.210
because when you're young,
you're fucking dumb man.
Oh yeah.

471
00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:59.480
No access to information.
There's no fucking Internet.
When I was a kid,

472
00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:01.970
I had the people in my neighborhood and school.
Yeah.

473
00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:04.760
<v 4>Is that shit anywhere grounded inside your brain though?
Like it,</v>

474
00:25:04.761 --> 00:25:06.440
does it ever come out where you're sitting there like,

475
00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:08.810
like I could after earthquake and were like,
Jesus,

476
00:25:08.970 --> 00:25:12.800
you bring out your rosary and stuff and you said no,
no,
no,
not at all.
No.

477
00:25:12.801 --> 00:25:14.840
It's gone pretty big time.
Where you,
what you Catholic?

478
00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:18.010
<v 1>I was raised Catholic when I was in first grade.
And then,
uh,</v>

479
00:25:18.030 --> 00:25:21.330
I immediately thought it was horseshit because first grade was so horrible,

480
00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:25.290
this fucking cunt,
none that I had sister Mary Josephine,

481
00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:29.130
this fucking crazy bitch.
She was just incarnate evil,

482
00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:34.680
an evil dried up old woman who wasted her life on some nonsense and fucking

483
00:25:35.071 --> 00:25:40.060
hated kids who were just super religious growing up.
No,
not at all.
And um,

484
00:25:40.110 --> 00:25:41.480
my parents were an interracial couple.

485
00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:45.990
It's like already then don't do a lot of cocaine and my parents.

486
00:25:45.991 --> 00:25:50.160
So what happened with me is I went from this religious upbringing from,
you know,

487
00:25:50.161 --> 00:25:54.720
Catholic school in first grade to moving to San Francisco in second grade with

488
00:25:54.721 --> 00:25:58.020
my mother's new husband who was a hippie.
Oh Wow.

489
00:25:58.050 --> 00:25:59.700
Computer programmer with long hair.

490
00:25:59.701 --> 00:26:03.390
So my dad was just like Cop Douche bag in jersey,
you know,

491
00:26:03.391 --> 00:26:05.910
and I grew up like in that like Catholic,
you know,
hey,

492
00:26:05.911 --> 00:26:09.870
you're not in the Lord's name in vain book,
son of a bitch,
slap you.
That kind of,

493
00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:13.650
I grew up in that.
Like people would just smack in the head for no reason.
Wow.

494
00:26:13.770 --> 00:26:17.820
I grew up in that and then all of a sudden hippies in San Francisco.
Wow.

495
00:26:17.821 --> 00:26:20.640
It was a total trip.
My next door neighbors were these gay dudes.

496
00:26:20.641 --> 00:26:24.030
He used to get naked and hang out with my aunt because my aunt,
you know,

497
00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:27.240
didn't worry about them fucking her,
you know,
because they were gay as fuck.

498
00:26:27.241 --> 00:26:31.760
Big Muscular Black Guy,
dark black Africa,
Kenya,
black.

499
00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:35.520
It's fuck you just be naked.
One lobes and his boyfriend and the ball,

500
00:26:35.521 --> 00:26:36.241
both of them were just,

501
00:26:36.241 --> 00:26:39.610
then they all get together and just smoke weed and take their clothes off.
Wow.

502
00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:41.430
Nobody fucked.
Nobody did anything.

503
00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:44.640
They just lie around smoking weed and I about this when I was seven.
Wow.

504
00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:44.931
You know,

505
00:26:44.931 --> 00:26:49.931
so I went from this fucking crazy primate jungle of Jersey.

506
00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:55.080
Italians
can each other and throwing shit at each other.

507
00:26:55.081 --> 00:26:56.910
It's just like being in a chimp cage.
Right.

508
00:26:57.060 --> 00:27:01.770
So I went from that to hippies and gay dudes were a naked smoking weed.

509
00:27:01.771 --> 00:27:04.440
Hanging out with my aunt does is hilarious.

510
00:27:04.730 --> 00:27:08.280
This is the craziest fucking won 80 ever.

511
00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:11.580
And you've got good parts of both though.
When you say like good parts of like,

512
00:27:11.581 --> 00:27:15.390
you know the,
the progressive thoughts and,
and ideas,
but also the,
you know,

513
00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:17.610
you're,
you're not your typical pussy comic.

514
00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:22.850
I'll tell you that much coast thing is where men are forced to become men.

515
00:27:23.071 --> 00:27:27.390
Sure.
At a quick age you get fucked with good,
you look in to kick your ass.

516
00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:30.420
You know,
the line of the west coast people,

517
00:27:30.421 --> 00:27:33.690
it's a little more relaxed in that.
Yeah,
it's good.

518
00:27:33.691 --> 00:27:35.100
It's good that it's more relaxed in that,

519
00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:38.160
but I think it creates people that are a little more confused.
Yeah.

520
00:27:38.161 --> 00:27:43.050
There does seem to be a,
a survival of the fittest element in Jersey,

521
00:27:43.051 --> 00:27:45.450
New York area.
Like a lot of the kids who want a smart people there,

522
00:27:45.451 --> 00:27:49.920
two men talk to some stressed out smart motherfuckers in New York.
Oh yeah.

523
00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:51.950
They're intense,
man.
They're fucking stressed out.

524
00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:53.070
I'll step outside for a cigarette.

525
00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:56.130
You don't even know what's going on with Lehman Marcus.

526
00:27:56.131 --> 00:27:59.280
And if I go the whole way,
the system is set up,
it's impossible for them to fail.

527
00:27:59.281 --> 00:28:01.110
What they're doing is they're getting fucking paint the blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

528
00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:03.930
These are smart,
super intense motherfuckers.
It's like,

529
00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:08.010
I have to choose what I do here because I can go with you on this crusade.
Right?

530
00:28:08.011 --> 00:28:12.330
Yeah,
exactly.
I lose my life to this crazy type of thinking or I can go,
yeah,

531
00:28:12.390 --> 00:28:15.650
I'm going to go to California.
Yeah.
And I'm going to smoke some pot and relaxed.

532
00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:18.240
It's definitely is if there is an intensity on the east coast,

533
00:28:18.241 --> 00:28:20.310
I mean there's definitely a reason that all the Ivy League schools are on the

534
00:28:20.311 --> 00:28:23.230
east coast.
It's like there's an intensity there and there's a,
there's a,

535
00:28:23.231 --> 00:28:27.050
there's a fervor about things.
Part of it has to do with dealing with weather.

536
00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:31.440
Weather is a humbling thing and I think it makes you,
you know,

537
00:28:31.441 --> 00:28:33.330
you have to stockpile food for the winter.
Sure.

538
00:28:33.390 --> 00:28:37.050
You didn't just have to do it in 1950 you how to do it in 1850 when there's no

539
00:28:37.051 --> 00:28:38.300
refrigerator.
Okay.

540
00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:41.430
And a lot of those people that live there are the ancestors for people that

541
00:28:41.431 --> 00:28:44.070
lived.
I mean,
those are the people that are established it and the other people,

542
00:28:44.530 --> 00:28:46.860
if it wasn't for,
if they weren't there 200 years ago,

543
00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:48.630
they were in another country.
Okay.

544
00:28:48.631 --> 00:28:51.240
And they took a chance coming over on a fucking boat,

545
00:28:51.241 --> 00:28:54.750
some place they've never seen when there was no movies about it,
no Internet.

546
00:28:54.810 --> 00:28:58.650
They had in your stories from someone,
a letter,
you know,
Dear John,

547
00:28:58.830 --> 00:29:03.180
I have made it here to new land.
Oh,
the fruit is plenty.

548
00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:07.800
A Brown people are strange.
They have paint on their face.
Gold is everywhere.

549
00:29:07.801 --> 00:29:08.880
Come soon,
right?

550
00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:13.230
So they took chances and fucking gun boats and traveled across a goddamn ocean

551
00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:16.860
when there's no gps,
no cell phones to fucking flares pitch.

552
00:29:16.861 --> 00:29:19.490
If that fucking poke goes down,
you're done.
That's it.

553
00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:21.150
You're in the middle of the ocean,

554
00:29:21.151 --> 00:29:25.050
which is bigger than the continent on a gamble for a maybe dam.

555
00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:28.160
And you're just hoping to float it out.
Crazy ass.

556
00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:30.420
That's how bad Europe sucked.

557
00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:35.340
Your sucks so bad in the 17 hundreds dudes are willing to get dysentery.

558
00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:39.900
All a raw.
And what would they get scurvy from?
No.
Vitamin C,

559
00:29:40.050 --> 00:29:44.770
they were fucking eating rats,
bro,
to stay alive.
People were dying.

560
00:29:44.770 --> 00:29:48.790
They were throwing them off the boat.
A lot of people die.
They would get sick,

561
00:29:48.791 --> 00:29:52.900
everyone would get ill,
the plague,
all that.
That's why they come here.

562
00:29:52.901 --> 00:29:57.340
They'd rather come here to nothing,
to having an established roads and shit.

563
00:29:57.910 --> 00:30:00.510
We had nothing.
And then we built our own,
we our own.
Yeah.

564
00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:02.620
They became to trees and water and they're like,

565
00:30:02.621 --> 00:30:06.550
I'll take it will take me the fuck away from these Douche bags over there.
Yeah,

566
00:30:07.030 --> 00:30:09.040
exactly.
And they kept the attitude too,

567
00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:12.220
especially on the east coast where they call on us.
They just kept the attitude.

568
00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:16.270
And I think it seems to me that the west coast is all slowly as far,

569
00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:17.260
far as you get out,

570
00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:20.770
a big percentage of those people are going to be the children of the people who

571
00:30:20.771 --> 00:30:23.530
originally landed.
Oh right.
They're going to be the people that got there.

572
00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:26.260
Everybody landed on the east branch.
Right,
right.
And so then they go,

573
00:30:26.261 --> 00:30:28.000
oh fuck this place.
Let's keep moving west.

574
00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:29.770
And they kept going and going and going and going.

575
00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:33.970
So the people that made it all the way here,
it's almost like spoiled children.

576
00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:35.023
Yeah.

577
00:30:35.770 --> 00:30:40.120
It's almost like they don't appreciate what it takes to make all this happen.

578
00:30:40.121 --> 00:30:42.700
Like you,
you're lucky you're just in a lucky spot.

579
00:30:42.930 --> 00:30:46.030
You found a spot where it doesn't snow and it doesn't get too hot.

580
00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:49.530
Hardly ever rains.
It's an easy spot to live.
It really is.

581
00:30:49.550 --> 00:30:52.170
And they say it does something to the psyche as far as,
you know,

582
00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:54.520
the lack of change kind of almost puts us in a,

583
00:30:54.521 --> 00:30:58.670
in a trance gear up for winter and all that.
Uh,

584
00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:02.020
I do like the idea of socializing.
They're on the east coast.

585
00:31:02.021 --> 00:31:03.840
They are a lot more social with each other and,
and,

586
00:31:03.841 --> 00:31:06.460
and like if you're in New York,
you can see a real heated debate,

587
00:31:06.461 --> 00:31:09.760
get really heated but never come to blows were on the west coast it would come

588
00:31:09.761 --> 00:31:13.090
to blows because it comes to stupid.
We don't comes to.
Exactly.
We don't,

589
00:31:13.091 --> 00:31:15.640
we don't cross paths with each other as much as they do.

590
00:31:15.641 --> 00:31:18.850
We don't share a confined space.
It's real spread out here and always has been.

591
00:31:19.050 --> 00:31:23.170
Well,
it's the,
they walk,
they walk,
no one walks here.
Oh,
not at all.

592
00:31:23.171 --> 00:31:25.540
There's no walking.
So it's,
it's,
it's a worse,

593
00:31:25.570 --> 00:31:29.410
much worse set up because you're so disconnected from all the people around you.

594
00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:33.700
That's why it's like there's such a big contrast between the haves and haves

595
00:31:33.701 --> 00:31:37.420
nots here.
It's the most obvious,
the most bling bling part of the country.

596
00:31:37.690 --> 00:31:40.480
And one of the reasons why it's because you feel disconnected from other people

597
00:31:40.481 --> 00:31:43.030
that you're around.
You're not touching them,
you're not in contact with them.

598
00:31:43.150 --> 00:31:44.370
You're on the subway with them.
You know,

599
00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:46.030
walking down the street and interacting with them.

600
00:31:46.031 --> 00:31:48.910
And because of that you feel like you're disconnected from them.

601
00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:51.190
You feel like you're not a part of them.
There's something else.

602
00:31:51.191 --> 00:31:52.720
And it makes a separatism between the two,

603
00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:55.660
the two gaps and there's a lack of respect for each other.
And it's like,

604
00:31:55.661 --> 00:31:58.270
that's the thing is you don't hear a,
you know,
the most racist,

605
00:31:58.271 --> 00:32:01.310
homophobic people are,
are places where there aren't any.
Yeah.

606
00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:05.770
Which is so funny because [inaudible] just so it will never understand.

607
00:32:05.771 --> 00:32:09.130
People who hate gay people because it had all the gay people I've ever met.

608
00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:13.510
70% of them were entertaining is fun.
Nicest,
happiest people in the room.

609
00:32:13.511 --> 00:32:17.170
They're like little teddy bears at Dick's and her trying to Jeff the piano guy.

610
00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:22.660
Was he one of the coolest motherfuckers of all times.
So cool.
So creative,
cool,

611
00:32:22.661 --> 00:32:25.480
loyal.
I mean [inaudible] a great guy.
Boy,

612
00:32:25.650 --> 00:32:29.350
why would you care if it had nothing to do with you?
That's stupid.

613
00:32:29.351 --> 00:32:33.820
That's the real prejudice should be against people who are prejudice against gay

614
00:32:33.821 --> 00:32:37.980
people.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Right?
That's like being,
look,

615
00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:39.890
it sounds like a terrible thing to say,

616
00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:44.110
but it's like being upset at someone for any other physical abnormalities.

617
00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:46.920
Being short,
you know,
paying,
being,
be,

618
00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:50.080
having a big fucking nose like Jacqueline hate people that have a big nose.
He,

619
00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:51.020
he's born gay.

620
00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:54.920
I don't think someone's born gay kids hang out with gay people who choose all

621
00:32:54.921 --> 00:32:57.290
tell you man.
Almost to a man.

622
00:32:57.291 --> 00:33:00.920
They all were like when I was seven I looked at the catalogs and I got hard on

623
00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:05.180
why it's illustrated,
made my Dick Tangle.
They all,

624
00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:06.450
they all tell you that there's,

625
00:33:06.530 --> 00:33:09.870
there's some deep seated fear that they have it within them if they hate them.

626
00:33:09.890 --> 00:33:13.130
I just,
some dudes that can be pushed into it and I think they're very scared,

627
00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:15.800
very scared on the fence.
People,

628
00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:18.950
there's a lot of people there are also wired to do what they're not supposed to

629
00:33:18.951 --> 00:33:21.650
do.
There's a lot of people that are just wired to do shit that's wrong.

630
00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:24.530
I think it has something to do with people that like below top videos,

631
00:33:24.890 --> 00:33:28.160
guys that like below Javi,
I think.
No,
I think some dudes for real,

632
00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:32.900
like some dudes are so dumb that there so like they fight the system no matter

633
00:33:32.901 --> 00:33:36.030
what they're wired to not do what they're supposed to arrive.
Right.

634
00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:38.480
If they're in a situation where they're drunk and they're with a guy,

635
00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:41.870
the situation and not do is not let this guy suck.
You're definitely right.

636
00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:46.070
They might be so crazy and stupid.
Right?
Let's see what this is like.

637
00:33:46.090 --> 00:33:49.910
Oh you want to do this shit and I didn't know is I don't give a fuck bro.

638
00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.390
I'll do whatever.
And I know we all have guys in our head that we're thinking of,

639
00:33:53.391 --> 00:33:56.690
but it's just like I go cause probably some of the same guys too.

640
00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:59.780
Especially within this,
this thing.
When you meet guys like that,

641
00:33:59.781 --> 00:34:04.360
I've met so many one we were talking about earlier in your kitchen.
Yeah,

642
00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:06.000
there's a lot of them out there.
This is all,

643
00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:09.360
there's a lot of people that are a mess but still man,
the,

644
00:34:09.361 --> 00:34:10.580
the prejudice against hating,

645
00:34:10.610 --> 00:34:13.850
hating gay people to me is one of the most disturbing ones.
It's kitten.

646
00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:17.210
It's getting exposed at it ain't cool though.
I mean it's,
it's definitely there,

647
00:34:17.211 --> 00:34:20.480
but like some really cool people are starting to say knock it off.
You know,

648
00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:24.170
it has to be because I want to be able to use the word faggot and not worry

649
00:34:24.171 --> 00:34:27.390
about anything.
I don't want anybody thinking I'm a Goddamn homophobe.
Yeah,

650
00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:28.730
not at all.
Not even a little bit.

651
00:34:28.910 --> 00:34:32.330
And I want to be able to make fun of crazy people like 10 haggard and not be

652
00:34:32.331 --> 00:34:33.880
called a home hall.
Right.
Right.

653
00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:38.020
Or this Eddie long character has been banging kids like yourself out of these

654
00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:41.840
crazy religious assholes that are pretending to be straight.
Right.
Really,

655
00:34:41.841 --> 00:34:44.960
they're gay and they're fucking people.
Yeah.
That doesn't mean as anything.

656
00:34:44.961 --> 00:34:49.310
We're all being gay when I'm talking about some crazy lie or not talking about

657
00:34:49.311 --> 00:34:52.070
two people that are in a consensual relationship and they enjoy it to the

658
00:34:52.071 --> 00:34:55.070
company and they both happened to be,
guys,
what do I give a fuck about that?

659
00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:59.750
What's funny to me is crazy assholes like 10 hag.
Oh yeah.

660
00:34:59.751 --> 00:35:03.640
Who go on a crusade doing math and getting hooked herself.

661
00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:06.920
Craig is looking out,
but it's a funny thing.

662
00:35:06.921 --> 00:35:09.340
Whereas if you start making fun of that guy,
all of a sudden you're,

663
00:35:09.341 --> 00:35:12.350
you're making fun of all games.
Yeah.
That's where it's getting,

664
00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:15.560
it's getting kind of ridiculous.
It's like you still have to be able to like,

665
00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:18.560
you know,
don't make fun of everything.
That's,
if it's valid,

666
00:35:18.561 --> 00:35:20.240
there's hood people and we make fun of them.

667
00:35:20.241 --> 00:35:21.950
It's not like we were making fun of all black people.
Like,
Hey,

668
00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:25.060
remember everybody getting raped in here?
Remember that the Internet put,

669
00:35:25.130 --> 00:35:28.960
is that the one?
Whatever.
Oh yeah.
Getting raped in there.

670
00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:31.790
It's like we were made fun of that person.
Oh,
all black people.

671
00:35:31.791 --> 00:35:35.030
It's just that person.
Same with a flamboyant gay or the guy hiding it.

672
00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:36.680
I mean at the gate,
guys like Haggerty.
That's hilarious.

673
00:35:36.681 --> 00:35:40.970
It's like you find out he's not just gay,
but he's the most devious.

674
00:35:41.110 --> 00:35:45.690
Just disgusting.
Like,
like it's almost like a law and order episode.

675
00:35:45.691 --> 00:35:47.430
It's so bad.
It's like,
are you kidding me?

676
00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:50.760
I loved the gay hooker that he was banging,
went on CNN,

677
00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:54.390
my matches out of him and he's like,
yeah,
I'm a gay hooker.

678
00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:56.730
He just went on CNN.

679
00:35:56.731 --> 00:36:00.570
It admitted he was a gay prostitute and he had sex several times with Ted

680
00:36:00.570 --> 00:36:03.490
Haggard and they smoked meth together and shit.
So brilliant.

681
00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:10.140
I think he probably got more dick after that.
I bet his fucking roster was stock.

682
00:36:10.170 --> 00:36:12.280
Oh,
your day?
No,
the gay hooker gay.

683
00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:16.500
It was like the best thing for his business ever.
If he was smart.
He said,

684
00:36:16.501 --> 00:36:19.590
I'll go on.
Just give me poke my website up there plugging my website.
Yeah,

685
00:36:19.591 --> 00:36:24.300
he got my Bible,
but they it.
Why should I come?
That kind of guy,
like when they,

686
00:36:24.301 --> 00:36:26.130
when they find out about guys like that,
I just slept.

687
00:36:26.131 --> 00:36:28.550
It's like you never think you're going to see that kind of justice in your life

688
00:36:28.551 --> 00:36:31.340
or you want to do it like I know one of the worst part.
Or you're like,

689
00:36:31.350 --> 00:36:33.870
how is this?
For me it's like that's exactly,

690
00:36:33.871 --> 00:36:37.260
it's like a gift from the universe to see rush limbo really get his or somebody

691
00:36:37.261 --> 00:36:38.041
like that.
You know what I mean?

692
00:36:38.041 --> 00:36:41.310
Like to see it somebody who's hooked on Oxycontin,
so it was pretty close.

693
00:36:41.370 --> 00:36:41.791
Homeboy,

694
00:36:41.791 --> 00:36:46.791
he's taken a hundred auctions a day and go ranting on against the liberal elite.

695
00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:51.300
You don't just kick that well,
it made him go deaf.

696
00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:55.380
How about that?
He was doing so many oxies he lost his hearing.

697
00:36:55.381 --> 00:36:59.370
Kahala oh,
that's what it what though?
How the fuck does that word?

698
00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:03.660
I'll let Alex Jones explained the medical,
the reasoning behind the town.

699
00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:06.120
I don't remember it.
Nor do I know if it's correct,

700
00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:10.050
but what he said and it makes sense to me.
I don't think,
look,
you go deaf.

701
00:37:10.051 --> 00:37:12.950
And by the way,
you happen to be doing a hundred docs.
He's a day shift.

702
00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:17.340
Might be related.
I can't believe it.
I can't hear,

703
00:37:17.341 --> 00:37:20.430
but I'm going to continue to use it cause I like,
hi.

704
00:37:20.830 --> 00:37:24.540
Did you can do a rush Limbaugh,
man,
we need to make some parody.
Yes.

705
00:37:24.541 --> 00:37:28.980
Rush Limbaugh,
I buy this off of a liberal,
but I do them.

706
00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:34.290
It's so funny that kind of just tuned into that Dum Dum ideology that just dumb,

707
00:37:34.291 --> 00:37:38.590
dumb.
You know,
I'm the,
I'm a fucking patriot.
Um,
I'm here to do this.

708
00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:40.080
There's a good god,

709
00:37:40.081 --> 00:37:44.450
Christian loving country here and we need to support all these Goddamn,
you know,

710
00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:47.400
hippies out there and liberals.
They're trying to take down this democracy,

711
00:37:47.401 --> 00:37:49.270
this great thing that was founded in 17 [inaudible].

712
00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:53.280
They'll just start rattling off facts.
He believes all that.
You think their APP,

713
00:37:53.770 --> 00:37:57.180
they know the acts,
right?
Roll acts.
They know it's far more complex than that,

714
00:37:57.181 --> 00:38:01.140
but it's,
that position is an excellent profit position.
Yeah.

715
00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:04.140
You can make a lot of fucking money being the Super Patriot guy.

716
00:38:04.141 --> 00:38:07.560
Rallying against the liberals especially is nobody wants to be a pussy and

717
00:38:07.561 --> 00:38:10.440
liberals are pussies.
Yeah.
That's the problem.
That's a big,
you know,
people go,

718
00:38:10.441 --> 00:38:13.010
what do you owe?
Grogan?
Don't tell me you're a liberal.
Come on,

719
00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:14.640
don't tell me I want freedom.

720
00:38:14.641 --> 00:38:17.370
Don't tell me I want the ability to express yourself or hindered.

721
00:38:17.470 --> 00:38:18.960
But I believe in the First Amendment,

722
00:38:19.150 --> 00:38:21.990
I think gay people should be willing to do whatever the fuck they want to do or

723
00:38:21.991 --> 00:38:23.520
allowed to do whatever the fuck they want to do.

724
00:38:23.710 --> 00:38:26.220
People should be able to get married.
You shouldn't have,
you know,

725
00:38:26.221 --> 00:38:28.020
hate crimes shouldn't be real.
I think.
Yeah,

726
00:38:28.021 --> 00:38:30.210
we should figure out how to fucking clean up the ghettos.

727
00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:34.350
They think we should figure out how to use some of our taxes to fucking help out

728
00:38:34.351 --> 00:38:37.210
little kids that are born into some shit position.

729
00:38:37.210 --> 00:38:39.820
And it's supposed to be all within the jurisdiction of this country.
So yeah.

730
00:38:39.821 --> 00:38:42.940
Why aren't we approaching it?
Yeah.
So if that makes me a liberal,
yeah,

731
00:38:42.941 --> 00:38:43.750
I'm a liberal,
which,

732
00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:46.600
which everything you named a lot of people are scared to realize that they are.

733
00:38:46.601 --> 00:38:48.790
I have a lot of friends,
especially back in Arizona growing up there.

734
00:38:48.791 --> 00:38:52.530
Do you know who,
look girl,
I'm from conservative.
It's like,
look at you,
you,
you,

735
00:38:52.531 --> 00:38:56.500
you look like a a rapper right now.
You're not conservative.
You,

736
00:38:56.510 --> 00:38:58.870
you quote Tupac,
you're not conservative.

737
00:38:58.910 --> 00:39:01.480
You're just not what people think of conservative.

738
00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:05.890
A lot of it is in support of big business and that's a problem because they say,

739
00:39:05.891 --> 00:39:08.890
well,
hey,
it's just fuck capitalism.
That's what his country so great.

740
00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:13.120
I totally am in favor of big business.
If it wasn't for them,

741
00:39:13.121 --> 00:39:14.680
we wouldn't have all this cool shit,

742
00:39:15.010 --> 00:39:19.750
but the problem is big business likes to act like it's not a person like it's

743
00:39:19.751 --> 00:39:22.690
above.
Being a person of big business was a person and did all this shit.

744
00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:26.190
It would get sued and closed down and rested and you,
you'd have to,

745
00:39:26.191 --> 00:39:29.380
we don't be an asshole.
The Calbert and Hal Burton theater,

746
00:39:29.410 --> 00:39:34.240
there's $90 billion missing from Iraq.
90 billion.

747
00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:39.040
Hal Burton was a dude and he's like,
I don't know.
It's fucking God man.

748
00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:42.310
They like Bob.
There's 90 billion,

749
00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:46.780
90,000 million.
Where the fuck is it?
I don't know.

750
00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:49.960
Think you could do that.
They would arrest that guy.
They go.

751
00:39:49.961 --> 00:39:53.380
It would be in shackles and in the court there would be the number one story on

752
00:39:53.381 --> 00:39:56.200
the news ever.
Yeah,
Bob Halliburton and then in the court today,

753
00:39:56.430 --> 00:39:59.530
it doesn't know where he put the 98 billion.
It's like misplacing a state.

754
00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:00.393
Like where's my homie?

755
00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:06.430
My homie go a number 90 billion.
That is so huge.

756
00:40:07.070 --> 00:40:10.690
That is such a sizable piece of money that could do so much for every state in

757
00:40:10.691 --> 00:40:14.320
the nation to this.
They would notice it.
I'm talking major shit,

758
00:40:14.321 --> 00:40:17.110
but they're missing so much money over there and they're missing money from the

759
00:40:17.111 --> 00:40:20.770
the mercenary accounts for missing.
Oh,
where the fuck anything is going?

760
00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:22.810
It's amazing.
It Monsanto,

761
00:40:22.930 --> 00:40:26.570
the fucking seed corporation that [inaudible] Genetically Modified Food

762
00:40:26.570 --> 00:40:29.110
Corporation,
the one that sells seeds,
foggy butters,

763
00:40:29.230 --> 00:40:32.890
and then makes the farmer by new seeds next year.
And if you can't use the seat,

764
00:40:33.490 --> 00:40:37.480
yeah,
you can't like reread news them like nature intends.
You can't,

765
00:40:37.481 --> 00:40:41.410
like if you buy a fucking tomato,
tomato has seeds in it.
You know,
and you know,

766
00:40:41.411 --> 00:40:43.630
or you Gregory,
you buy seats with a tomato,

767
00:40:43.631 --> 00:40:45.820
grow the tomato and then take the seeds out of tomatoes.

768
00:40:45.821 --> 00:40:48.790
You grow and replant them.
Della rescue in the law,
you're breaking the law.

769
00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:51.920
They just bought blackwater.
Geez.
They

770
00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:56.650
just been boast.

771
00:40:56.710 --> 00:41:01.600
Evil Corporation bought the second most evil corvette is awful.

772
00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:04.840
I saw that.
I saw with the good to those poor farmers,
those poor guys.

773
00:41:04.841 --> 00:41:07.240
They're like,
what am I supposed to do?
They're like,
you go and see Joe,

774
00:41:07.241 --> 00:41:07.830
aren't you?

775
00:41:07.830 --> 00:41:11.440
A chick named Kirkland from tap out radio sent me a documentary and I've watched

776
00:41:11.441 --> 00:41:12.160
it and it's,

777
00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:15.610
it's all about these people from these impoverished countries that committed

778
00:41:15.611 --> 00:41:20.590
suicide because they couldn't repay the debt that they owe to Monsanto.
Dude,

779
00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:25.600
it's all about how what they figured out was if you could get patents on plants,

780
00:41:26.170 --> 00:41:29.830
if you could modify a plant and get a patent on it,
then you own it.

781
00:41:29.831 --> 00:41:32.680
Then you copyright that plant's yours.
No one else can grow it.

782
00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:37.430
You can control it.
Just like downloads on the Internet.
That's fucking nuts man.

783
00:41:37.431 --> 00:41:39.200
They figured out a way to do that with food.

784
00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:41.240
I figured out a way to to copyright foods.

785
00:41:42.110 --> 00:41:43.910
<v 3>When I saw that I saw,
you know,
a bunch of those,</v>

786
00:41:43.911 --> 00:41:45.410
that king cone and all those other ones.

787
00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:48.560
I was honest to God completely naive about the whole thing.

788
00:41:48.561 --> 00:41:51.230
I don't eat fast food right and that kind of crap.
But I was like,

789
00:41:51.231 --> 00:41:52.190
I think I'm doing okay,

790
00:41:52.191 --> 00:41:55.040
but I don't realize it doesn't matter that I'm getting the choice cut of beef at

791
00:41:55.041 --> 00:41:59.560
Ralph's.
It's still from this corn fed,
you know,
slaughtered.
Right.

792
00:41:59.570 --> 00:42:04.570
They said there was something like 14,000 slaughterhouses in America in the

793
00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:06.200
early eighties and now there's like five,
right?

794
00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:09.710
Like literally like it's all going down through one company,

795
00:42:09.890 --> 00:42:12.860
Tyson farms and and a,
I can't remember the other one,

796
00:42:12.861 --> 00:42:16.220
but it's like literally your meat is all and it's like if one's bad,

797
00:42:16.221 --> 00:42:17.780
that's why people are getting sick with a cold.

798
00:42:17.781 --> 00:42:21.050
I like all over it in mass numbers because it's like,
it's not,

799
00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:23.540
nothing's regionalize anymore.
It's all centralized.
It's,

800
00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:25.360
it's like we make it here,
we chopped the meetup,

801
00:42:25.370 --> 00:42:27.950
we put the bad with the good and would sell it to you.
You know,
it's like,

802
00:42:27.951 --> 00:42:32.150
unless you're getting shit from,
you know,
a farmer that,
you know,
as a farmer,

803
00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:36.920
your local.
Luckily here we've got 'em farmer's markets,
but it's just,

804
00:42:36.921 --> 00:42:37.760
it's disgusting.

805
00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:39.830
<v 1>That's fucked up thing about people.</v>

806
00:42:39.831 --> 00:42:42.980
The disconnect between the meat and your food,

807
00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:45.650
the disconnect between where it comes from.
Oh,
here's a,

808
00:42:45.651 --> 00:42:47.350
there's a big disconnect there.
You know,

809
00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:48.750
I've told people that I want to go hunting.

810
00:42:48.751 --> 00:42:52.030
I'm supposed to go hunting with Ricky Schroder this season.
And uh,

811
00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:56.300
Rick shorter loves to hunt.
Really?
Just kind of crazy.
But uh,
um,
but,

812
00:42:56.301 --> 00:42:58.370
and I tell people about that,
like,
why would you want to kill an animal?

813
00:42:58.371 --> 00:43:00.520
Why would you want to do that?
Like,
you eat meat,
don't you eat here?

814
00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:02.270
Someone's killing that.
Well,
you know what?

815
00:43:02.271 --> 00:43:04.190
I don't have to see it if I don't have to see it.
I want to say it.

816
00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:07.340
You don't want to see it,
but you're experiencing what comes from it.

817
00:43:07.341 --> 00:43:10.310
And that's like there's,
there's a disconnect there that can never be healthy,

818
00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:13.670
can never be healthy to be eating animals and not know what it feels like to

819
00:43:13.671 --> 00:43:15.820
kill an animal.
Yeah,
you're right about that.

820
00:43:16.070 --> 00:43:17.570
It can't be because you're not going to appreciate it.

821
00:43:17.830 --> 00:43:20.690
When you think about the people that we consider the most in tune with nature,

822
00:43:20.691 --> 00:43:22.040
those are the American Indians,
right?

823
00:43:22.041 --> 00:43:24.530
Those are the ones that we always glorify and we always,
you know,

824
00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:28.790
saying that these are the guys that were like in tune with the used every part

825
00:43:28.791 --> 00:43:31.220
of the buffalo that they killed.
They didn't waste anything.

826
00:43:31.221 --> 00:43:34.760
They'd lived harmonious,
harmonious harmoniously with her.
They would,
you know,

827
00:43:34.761 --> 00:43:38.520
like praise the spirit of the animal that provided them with food.
You know,
they,

828
00:43:38.521 --> 00:43:39.320
they had this,

829
00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:44.030
this respect for their own prey was like very prevalent throughout their
culture.

830
00:43:44.031 --> 00:43:44.271
You know,

831
00:43:44.271 --> 00:43:47.330
respect for the buffalo and all these different stories about the phone on fall

832
00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:48.710
on slaughter them all.

833
00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:52.070
Ood You mean you want to talk about how destructing human beings can be?

834
00:43:52.071 --> 00:43:55.610
That's one of the greatest stories ever.
Oh yeah.
Just how many they slaughter.

835
00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:58.910
Just slaughtered them.
And how short a time?
There was a millions.

836
00:43:59.210 --> 00:44:00.920
They used to be all over the place.

837
00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:04.610
Buffalo used to be like overwhelming all over this country.

838
00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:08.000
I freak out if I saw one once,
one in my life be crazy.

839
00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:12.050
And they just went just nutty shooting all of them and taken a skins that was

840
00:44:12.051 --> 00:44:15.380
like a big business shooting buffaloes and selling their skins.

841
00:44:15.470 --> 00:44:18.200
<v 3>Yeah.
And then,
and they didn't know they were picking them off like what?</v>

842
00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:18.471
You know,

843
00:44:18.471 --> 00:44:20.900
just like cherries in the beginning because they didn't know what to be afraid

844
00:44:20.901 --> 00:44:24.170
of man,
because they never had been.
And they never heard a gun,
you know,

845
00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:26.930
they didn't know to scatter when they heard that gun.
They just boom,

846
00:44:26.931 --> 00:44:28.570
one would drop,
boom.
Another withdrawal.

847
00:44:28.730 --> 00:44:33.730
<v 1>Talk about a fucking species getting jacked species living forever.</v>

848
00:44:34.321 --> 00:44:36.990
And there's one spot having no problems eating grass,

849
00:44:36.991 --> 00:44:41.991
wandering around and all sudden these little pink monkeys with metal bands come

850
00:44:42.421 --> 00:44:44.970
out of nowhere.
Just start dropping motherfuckers.

851
00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:49.050
We talk about an alien invasion man and you're terrifying muscle that she had

852
00:44:49.051 --> 00:44:51.540
been to buffalo.
Oh I know.
That's like an alien invasion.

853
00:44:51.541 --> 00:44:55.920
That's like fucking we are the war or war of world.
We are the world.

854
00:44:57.420 --> 00:45:00.210
We are the road.
All the monkeys are holding hands with the Buffalo.

855
00:45:00.510 --> 00:45:03.780
Think about how fucking freaky that would be a buffalo were intelligent and this

856
00:45:03.781 --> 00:45:06.570
just started happening and they were just stuck with these goofy buffalo bodies.

857
00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:10.840
Dolphine body softens can't really move anything around.
Yeah,
they can't,

858
00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:14.490
they can't manipulate things.
They're kind of stuck just as much as buffalo are.

859
00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:17.330
You just can't say that man doesn't have an effect on us.
An environment.

860
00:45:17.331 --> 00:45:22.020
Cause that's the first series of evidence that that proves that we wiped out

861
00:45:22.021 --> 00:45:23.910
Indians,
buffaloes and everything.

862
00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:27.840
We'd make shit extinct and then we bring a thing or two back like the California

863
00:45:27.841 --> 00:45:31.320
condor again.
But it was like who?
Yeah.
Right.
Keep that spot at home.

864
00:45:32.510 --> 00:45:36.540
That little prick.
Who is my front yard that Al,
I hate that prick.
I hate it.

865
00:45:36.541 --> 00:45:39.030
I hate his guts owl.
That lives in my neighborhood,
bro.

866
00:45:39.031 --> 00:45:41.670
I see this motherfucker at night.
He's a big like a dog.

867
00:45:42.770 --> 00:45:44.410
Eagles are no joke.

868
00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:48.660
They're not ar big and fucking scary and they're like the most ruthless

869
00:45:48.661 --> 00:45:52.140
predators.
Oh,
big time was attack eagles.
They go an eagle's nest.

870
00:45:52.141 --> 00:45:54.420
Why Eagles are sleeping and killed him.
How about that?

871
00:45:54.421 --> 00:45:57.210
Those are those fucking talons.
They get you,
man.
I seen them.

872
00:45:57.211 --> 00:46:00.000
Jack rabbits around here,
man.
It's a trip.
You're like,

873
00:46:00.001 --> 00:46:03.790
you're watching like wild kingdom type shit.
Right?
Right on my street.
It's weird.

874
00:46:03.791 --> 00:46:07.380
I have to have a bird.
There's a bird of prey living in our front yard.
Big One,

875
00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:10.560
and when he gets loud at night,
Ooh,
yeah.
I'm just like,
please be quiet.

876
00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:14.700
It's just so scary.
It's like you hear it coming from his diaphragm.

877
00:46:14.701 --> 00:46:18.130
He sees a man.
It's like,
yeah,
it's like a man.
It's like a 60 pound Anders,

878
00:46:18.150 --> 00:46:20.560
a dude out in the tree.
I mean,
I don't know how much they actually weigh,

879
00:46:20.561 --> 00:46:23.610
but it looks like if it was a dog and be like a wheel and a bed,
they get better.

880
00:46:23.611 --> 00:46:26.400
Take Five,
six foot wingspan flying cat.

881
00:46:26.430 --> 00:46:29.370
There was one outside bigger than cat and the cat,

882
00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:32.250
there was one outside my window the other day.
He was just sitting on my railing.

883
00:46:32.430 --> 00:46:37.290
Mother fucker was,
he had to be almost three feet tall,
loud.
It was playing their,

884
00:46:37.370 --> 00:46:40.650
their,
their pelts gray thing.
But I'm looking,

885
00:46:40.660 --> 00:46:45.660
I'm like that's how a demon thing that only comes out at night and just Jackson

886
00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:48.980
takes advantage of the fact that everyone else is sleeping and just fucks.

887
00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:50.880
Like you got to think like the first person to see.

888
00:46:50.881 --> 00:46:54.240
Like I was thinking that about silverback gorillas compared to the men that they

889
00:46:54.241 --> 00:46:57.950
are discovered pretty recently in the grand scheme of things.
I think the,

890
00:46:58.140 --> 00:47:00.900
the mountain gorilla in the 50s was like the first time somebody came across

891
00:47:00.901 --> 00:47:04.740
like this healthy,
furry black men who can,

892
00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:09.420
I'm half black by the way,
audience,
just to get that out of the way.
Um,

893
00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:12.570
but uh,
like just this monster monster,

894
00:47:12.590 --> 00:47:17.590
there's hundred town ferocious vegetarian and nobody would believe little tiny

895
00:47:18.751 --> 00:47:22.370
ones.
Yeah.
When he's full animals at that too,
you notice them versus the chimps.

896
00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:26.080
Chimps are the ones with those screws.
They start clapping,
you know,

897
00:47:26.170 --> 00:47:27.360
out of control.
They're like gangs,

898
00:47:27.361 --> 00:47:31.460
but the gorilla just eats and all the vegetarians.
That's the difference.
Yeah,

899
00:47:31.470 --> 00:47:33.030
that's clearly a difference.
I mean they,

900
00:47:33.050 --> 00:47:36.670
they figured out a way to supply the body with just plants.

901
00:47:36.730 --> 00:47:39.920
So there's no need to be aggressive except to protect themselves.
Are you,

902
00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:44.520
are you a vegetarian?
No.
Do you know a Herschel Walker?
Yes.
What's his,
his,
his,

903
00:47:44.830 --> 00:47:48.850
his,
his diet real.
It may not be bread and it doesn't make any sense,

904
00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:51.340
but it does it.
How does it make any sense?
You didn't maintain man?

905
00:47:51.341 --> 00:47:55.330
Apparently Hershel Walker is one of those guys and he's a tremendous athlete and

906
00:47:55.331 --> 00:47:56.410
an incredible competitor.

907
00:47:56.411 --> 00:48:00.410
I'm just a great football player and he's been a great spokesperson for,
uh,

908
00:48:00.490 --> 00:48:03.760
depression and for a brain injuries and shit like that.
And he's so fucking,

909
00:48:03.761 --> 00:48:07.450
and he's a bad motherfucker and he's a tremendous athlete and I'm very impressed

910
00:48:07.451 --> 00:48:08.680
with the way he gets to the strike force.

911
00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:13.240
But the knock on him is that he wants people to think and know that he's

912
00:48:13.241 --> 00:48:16.510
extraordinary.
Right.
You know,
so,
I mean,
he is extraordinary.
The athlete.

913
00:48:16.511 --> 00:48:18.850
He's got an extraordinary work ethic,
extraordinary abilities,

914
00:48:19.210 --> 00:48:22.240
but he wants people to think that he's like something out of this world.

915
00:48:22.241 --> 00:48:25.120
So when you say something like,
I don't know,
this is true.
I mean,

916
00:48:25.121 --> 00:48:27.610
this is just what I've heard.
What I've heard is that he'll say,
well,

917
00:48:27.611 --> 00:48:29.890
I only eat a bowl of soup a day.
Meanwhile,

918
00:48:30.370 --> 00:48:33.520
fucking eating food and I look at them,
weighs 220 pounds.
So had disappeared.

919
00:48:34.370 --> 00:48:36.880
That's the thing.
Coffee with your crazy talk,
he's massive.

920
00:48:36.881 --> 00:48:41.020
His trap start from the bottom of his ears and gun necessarily believe has died.

921
00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:44.800
Black.
I'm a huge fan.
He's,
I mean,
I've heard my whole life growing up,

922
00:48:44.801 --> 00:48:47.230
they were like,
he only does pushups.
The only just prison work.
Yeah.
I'm like,

923
00:48:47.231 --> 00:48:51.160
does he does that?
But the meal thing,
I was like,
there's no way.

924
00:48:51.190 --> 00:48:51.881
It doesn't make any sense.

925
00:48:51.881 --> 00:48:54.670
Your body eat it to your muscles would continue to eat them.

926
00:48:54.671 --> 00:48:57.520
So there's no food that's not enough calories.
Yeah,
that's ridiculous.

927
00:48:57.550 --> 00:49:00.630
It doesn't make any sense.
It's just,
it's like one plus one is 89 right.

928
00:49:00.670 --> 00:49:02.890
So what you're saying to me,
what you're saying,
you eat a bowl of soup every day.

929
00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:03.151
Okay.

930
00:49:03.151 --> 00:49:06.790
And you wait to 20 and you fucking do MMA workouts for three hours a day and

931
00:49:06.791 --> 00:49:10.030
you're 47.
Exactly.
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?

932
00:49:10.460 --> 00:49:12.900
You said some nonsense.
God,
that's another way.
I mean,

933
00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:15.640
I don't know what he's really eating it.
I don't even know what he really said,

934
00:49:15.730 --> 00:49:19.480
but I've heard people that were very knowledgeable that were professional

935
00:49:19.690 --> 00:49:24.300
fitness people,
instructors and you know,
and,
and personal trainers,

936
00:49:24.350 --> 00:49:26.860
fight trainers and nutritionists.
I've heard every,

937
00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:29.860
I've heard like a conversation like amongst six guys and they were all saying,

938
00:49:29.861 --> 00:49:33.040
there's no fucking way.
No Way.
There's no way.
Even with supplements,

939
00:49:33.041 --> 00:49:35.630
there's no way you just like,
this guy's eating food.
He has to eat foods.

940
00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:37.930
You have,
you know,
I mean,
some guys go vegan.

941
00:49:37.931 --> 00:49:40.760
There's a lot of guys that are vegans.
Yeah,
that's pretty extreme.
Um,

942
00:49:40.810 --> 00:49:43.630
Antonio Mckean,
he's very successful wrestler.
He's really good.

943
00:49:43.631 --> 00:49:46.300
He's been undefeated for like,
I think six,
seven years in a row.

944
00:49:46.510 --> 00:49:49.930
Just fuck it takes guys down out work some.
He's a,
he's a Vegan,

945
00:49:49.931 --> 00:49:53.300
straight Vegan Mac Dansik.
He's another one is how do you get,
I mean,

946
00:49:53.410 --> 00:49:56.110
how do you get your protein?
It's like I could never be one.
I mean,

947
00:49:56.111 --> 00:50:01.111
when he was the best source because keen was his grain licious spelled queen

948
00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:06.490
knowns.
It's spelled like Q,
u,
I o n a or something like that.
It's not,

949
00:50:06.790 --> 00:50:08.590
yeah,
it's really good.
And it's a,

950
00:50:08.591 --> 00:50:11.470
it's a grain that has all the amino acids in it,

951
00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:14.410
but if you have like hemp protein,
you're not going to get all of them.

952
00:50:14.411 --> 00:50:17.200
And if you have like,
you know,
rice protein,
you're not getting it.
All of them.

953
00:50:17.380 --> 00:50:21.190
It's,
you don't get the same stuff that you get out of meat unless you're very

954
00:50:21.191 --> 00:50:23.770
careful.
You gotta be really careful with your protein.
I mean,

955
00:50:24.130 --> 00:50:28.790
is it better to be a vegetarian do thing?
I don't.
So not necessarily,
you know,

956
00:50:28.791 --> 00:50:33.170
it's an interesting story when I'm Travis Barker from blink one 80 whatever the

957
00:50:33.171 --> 00:50:36.270
fuck it is.
What does he to do with tattoos?
Yeah.

958
00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:40.790
You know that guy got in a terrible plane crash with Tj and yeah.
Well when,

959
00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:42.740
when he got fucked up in that plane crash,

960
00:50:42.890 --> 00:50:47.180
that's when he became a meat eater because the skin gap graphs weren't taking

961
00:50:47.690 --> 00:50:50.540
skin graphs where I taking and then once he started eating meat,

962
00:50:50.541 --> 00:50:55.340
they started taking why I think I've been eating hardcore Vegan for like the

963
00:50:55.340 --> 00:50:57.820
last couple of weeks and how many dicks you suck in those times.
But no,
but,

964
00:50:57.830 --> 00:51:00.920
but I've been only doing it like 90% of the time.
Meaning I'm not like,

965
00:51:00.921 --> 00:51:03.800
I still throw in steak and stuff like that here and there,

966
00:51:03.801 --> 00:51:07.580
but so I'm not doing a 100% Vegan,
but I have noticed since I've been eating it,

967
00:51:07.581 --> 00:51:09.440
I just feel way better and like,
well,

968
00:51:09.441 --> 00:51:11.940
you need to clean your dog and cheese by the way.

969
00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:16.280
So are you using to clean your diet up?
You know that.
So I've always been,

970
00:51:16.460 --> 00:51:19.010
I've always been eating healthy for weight watchers because I've been doing

971
00:51:19.011 --> 00:51:21.380
weight watchers for like four years,
so I'm still,
I'm not eating,

972
00:51:22.700 --> 00:51:25.880
I've been on weight watchers to this this whole time.
But you will fluctuate.

973
00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:28.570
You'll go like back and forth.
What I'm saying is that there's,

974
00:51:28.580 --> 00:51:32.120
you're obviously not watching it all the time and if you do and you all of a

975
00:51:32.121 --> 00:51:34.760
sudden get on a strict thing like like a a Vegan Diet,

976
00:51:34.970 --> 00:51:37.970
when you're getting all these nutrients and all this fiber and all this water

977
00:51:37.971 --> 00:51:40.310
and your system,
you're going to feel way better for sure,

978
00:51:40.730 --> 00:51:43.530
but a lot of it is because I've been eating a shitload of Qinhuangdao.

979
00:51:43.580 --> 00:51:47.090
That's my new favorite thing came off.
Like I said,

980
00:51:47.091 --> 00:51:51.590
it's spelled funky but it's protein or it's what they say is the most complete

981
00:51:51.710 --> 00:51:55.430
plant based protein.
There's a plus.
What swingers that makes the best.

982
00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:58.310
You just go there and get a side of it.
I make protein shakes.

983
00:51:58.311 --> 00:51:59.360
I put hemp protein in it.

984
00:51:59.361 --> 00:52:01.910
Had protein is pretty good the way pros and really is better.

985
00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:02.841
That's what I was doing.

986
00:52:02.841 --> 00:52:06.170
I was doing 150 grams of the whey protein is probably strangely enough.

987
00:52:06.171 --> 00:52:09.350
I had developed a kidney stone shortly after that.
Ran The water shot.

988
00:52:09.380 --> 00:52:12.900
Next time you gotta drink water,
Sun Porch,
drinking a lot more now.

989
00:52:12.980 --> 00:52:17.390
Very important.
Even better than water.
You ever have coconut water?
Oh shit son.

990
00:52:17.420 --> 00:52:21.620
Oh,
you got to coconut water it up man.
It's the best.
Coco would no water.

991
00:52:21.621 --> 00:52:25.490
It's called o two C.

992
00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:27.420
It's called C o.

993
00:52:27.710 --> 00:52:32.140
C o two c two o c two.
Oh,

994
00:52:32.380 --> 00:52:33.710
that's fucking awesome.

995
00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:37.520
Wait way better than that coconut one or whatever it's called

996
00:52:39.900 --> 00:52:44.540
because it just crashed this coconut waters,
the fucking bomb diggity folks.

997
00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:47.840
And it's super healthy for you.
Coconut water,
if you,
uh,

998
00:52:47.930 --> 00:52:52.010
if you look at it's like nutritional profile,
it's way better for you then.
Um,

999
00:52:52.011 --> 00:52:55.820
sports drinks.
No,
it's like the best for you.

1000
00:52:55.821 --> 00:52:59.750
Like right after you get done working out.
Sweet.
It's delicious too.

1001
00:53:00.380 --> 00:53:02.990
It is good.
So you've got to take care of your body,
son.

1002
00:53:03.010 --> 00:53:06.680
It's all we're talking about here.
Fitness and shit.
I just started,
you know,

1003
00:53:06.681 --> 00:53:07.514
I'm 30.

1004
00:53:08.420 --> 00:53:12.680
I have to say this one more time because I get people complain when someone
goes,

1005
00:53:12.700 --> 00:53:17.000
Oh,
I'm a vegetarian.
I go,
how many dicks are so I'm not serious.
Okay.

1006
00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:20.380
Fucking relaxed with the tweets.
You ignorant.
Asshole.

1007
00:53:20.390 --> 00:53:22.450
Vegetarianism is not equal gate.

1008
00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:26.970
If you're dealing with animal suffering and cruelty.
It's just a joke,
man.

1009
00:53:27.080 --> 00:53:28.210
You think Mr. Rogers was,

1010
00:53:28.890 --> 00:53:32.580
cause I watched it the other day and I felt like I was watching like myself

1011
00:53:32.581 --> 00:53:35.940
getting raped or something like that was like,
oh,
this creepy guy.
Oh my God,

1012
00:53:35.941 --> 00:53:38.480
he's so gay now.
There's a lot of girls like that.

1013
00:53:38.490 --> 00:53:40.590
Or like Mr Wizzard that couldn't be around to me.

1014
00:53:40.591 --> 00:53:45.180
Like old guy I pyramid and the base to Rogers was probably one of those guys

1015
00:53:45.181 --> 00:53:46.260
that was gay.
Oh.

1016
00:53:46.290 --> 00:53:50.700
But he never did anything and do anything because he didn't want to ruin his

1017
00:53:50.701 --> 00:53:54.270
reputation.
He was very kept.
He probably and cried.

1018
00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:57.330
He probably had three secrets,
you know,
that haunted him everyday.

1019
00:53:57.840 --> 00:54:00.810
Tracy Rogers is a,
is a pillar in the woods.

1020
00:54:01.210 --> 00:54:04.440
It's something probably happened him in that,
but whatever that drawing,

1021
00:54:04.441 --> 00:54:08.460
the artist's guy used to go on canoe trips with kids.
Bob Ross

1022
00:54:10.820 --> 00:54:14.110
[inaudible] dealing with the kid and this weekend,

1023
00:54:15.420 --> 00:54:19.490
are you battling impressionists?
I like,
you know who I love if you'll Howser,

1024
00:54:19.550 --> 00:54:23.580
you know,
in an La guy for the rest of the country.

1025
00:54:24.070 --> 00:54:27.150
He says local guy and he's kind of,
he's,
he's kind of a country bumpkin,

1026
00:54:27.151 --> 00:54:29.790
but he's just as nice in his pleased with everything and you take them anywhere.

1027
00:54:29.791 --> 00:54:33.120
It's like,
wow,
what's that?
They'll be like,
it's a water fountain.
You know,

1028
00:54:33.121 --> 00:54:37.350
it's not even on the floor.
Let's go.
Oh Wow.
What does it do?
But he's on PBS.

1029
00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:40.850
It's one of these shows you get so addicted to watching.

1030
00:54:40.860 --> 00:54:44.220
It's such bad programming.
You begin to love it,
really love it.

1031
00:54:44.490 --> 00:54:48.180
And you just see this guy,
he goes all around California,
kind of annoying people,

1032
00:54:48.181 --> 00:54:51.030
but he's likable.
You know what I mean?
And I saw him one time,

1033
00:54:51.031 --> 00:54:54.980
I lived in La Hollywood for 10 years and I was like starstruck.
I was like not,

1034
00:54:54.981 --> 00:54:59.040
there's a star you'll houser cause you feel like you're the only one on earth

1035
00:54:59.041 --> 00:55:02.520
watching his show.
Well other people watch it too and it becomes entertaining.

1036
00:55:02.700 --> 00:55:05.820
What,
what is [inaudible] and it's terrible.
Right?

1037
00:55:05.970 --> 00:55:09.420
Becomes so terrible because it's awesome.
Yeah,
exactly.
Then because weird,

1038
00:55:09.450 --> 00:55:11.980
it's like watching a really bad news cast or something.

1039
00:55:11.981 --> 00:55:15.060
He don't know that it's the problem with like the guys that are like,

1040
00:55:15.300 --> 00:55:18.940
they're doing unintentional comedy.
I don't know.
They don't know.
Brilliant.

1041
00:55:19.130 --> 00:55:21.540
So when you talk to them,
that's when you get,
you get bummed out,

1042
00:55:21.790 --> 00:55:24.830
start talking to him and cause you're goofing on him.
But they don't,

1043
00:55:24.930 --> 00:55:28.490
they don't want to be goofed on a meeting with Oliver Stone.

1044
00:55:29.070 --> 00:55:33.630
Oh Wow.
It sure is Nate.
Some dudes don't.

1045
00:55:33.660 --> 00:55:36.950
They don't want to be that guy.
Yeah.
Who else is like that?

1046
00:55:36.951 --> 00:55:38.920
Like some people and some people embrace it though.
You know,

1047
00:55:38.921 --> 00:55:43.080
like you take like a hassle hopper or somebody William Shatner.

1048
00:55:43.081 --> 00:55:46.590
That's the coolest guy ever.
You know what I mean?
It's like I'm a Douche bag.
Yes,

1049
00:55:46.591 --> 00:55:49.620
but I'm a good one.
You know?
It's just got that.
It's got that.

1050
00:55:49.621 --> 00:55:53.850
I know I'm a douche feeling.
I don't think know.
We're used to just go so much.

1051
00:55:53.880 --> 00:55:57.510
So many people tugging on them.
You have to act a certain way.
He's,
he's,

1052
00:55:57.910 --> 00:56:01.380
you have to be able to distance yourself slightly from people.
Braces,

1053
00:56:01.381 --> 00:56:04.140
the caricature he is,
you know what I mean?
There's a little of that,

1054
00:56:04.141 --> 00:56:05.440
but he's also,
you know,

1055
00:56:05.550 --> 00:56:08.800
he's a fucking talented guys who've been around a long Goddamn to shipped.

1056
00:56:08.870 --> 00:56:13.300
It will be fuck with them all day.
I don't know anything about price.
Yeah,

1057
00:56:13.410 --> 00:56:16.650
exactly.
He was killer on,
that's why he's on the greatest twilight zone episode.

1058
00:56:16.651 --> 00:56:21.450
Ever nightmare at 20,000 feet.
How crazy is my man Charlie sheet?
Oh Dude,

1059
00:56:21.451 --> 00:56:24.550
I love it.
The story just keeps getting better,
man.
Charlie Sheen,

1060
00:56:25.140 --> 00:56:26.500
<v 3>if you don't know the story,</v>

1061
00:56:26.501 --> 00:56:30.280
Charlie Sheen got arrested in a hotel in New York City.

1062
00:56:30.281 --> 00:56:35.281
Coked up screaming nigger prostitute was locked in his bathroom porn process.

1063
00:56:36.660 --> 00:56:41.260
The porn star who wasn't even black porn stars wasn't even black.

1064
00:56:41.261 --> 00:56:45.970
He just brought the word and he,
um,
wanted to,
uh,
to get her to fuck him,

1065
00:56:45.971 --> 00:56:48.460
but she wouldn't do anything until she got her money and he couldn't find his

1066
00:56:48.461 --> 00:56:52.270
money.
This is a story that radar online was saying.
So,
uh,
he,
uh,

1067
00:56:52.810 --> 00:56:56.950
he fucking starts punching holes in the wall screaming nigger.
Yeah.
I love that.

1068
00:56:57.160 --> 00:56:59.890
When I heard that,
I was like,
it's getting so good now.
It's like,

1069
00:56:59.920 --> 00:57:01.500
it's like you can't get any better.

1070
00:57:01.530 --> 00:57:04.720
I it really wake you get better as if his bitch had her iPhone out,

1071
00:57:04.820 --> 00:57:08.710
please release released the video almost looking at this like guy at like almost

1072
00:57:08.711 --> 00:57:10.000
like he's untouchable.

1073
00:57:10.180 --> 00:57:14.320
This guy's on about the fuck he's got a race.

1074
00:57:15.310 --> 00:57:16.660
There's something going on there.

1075
00:57:16.661 --> 00:57:19.120
Cause I don't know if you guys remember like six months ago there was something

1076
00:57:19.121 --> 00:57:22.540
to do with like Mexican gangs and those guys and what guys,

1077
00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:27.420
the cast of that show,
the two kids,
the two dads and a kid was the kid.

1078
00:57:27.870 --> 00:57:28.690
Somebody was trying to,

1079
00:57:28.690 --> 00:57:33.690
his ex wife like hired a dude like Omar from the wire or something to go grill

1080
00:57:34.150 --> 00:57:34.600
him.

1081
00:57:34.600 --> 00:57:39.600
Like there was a no Daugherty from what the other guy from the show.

1082
00:57:39.620 --> 00:57:43.150
The other guy from the show that show is straight up gangster.

1083
00:57:43.151 --> 00:57:46.870
You go see a filming,
you said straight up and you do your hands.

1084
00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:50.820
You're the least gangster man ever exist.
You could do a filming of that.

1085
00:57:50.830 --> 00:57:52.750
There's probably some sketchy shit there.
You know,

1086
00:57:52.751 --> 00:57:56.930
like there's probably like crazy gang and the worst thing if the show is awful,

1087
00:57:56.931 --> 00:57:59.500
I went,
the show is,
oh,
it seems like it show is horrible.

1088
00:57:59.500 --> 00:58:02.010
I don't understand if mad men was rid of well shit like that,
I'd be like,
oh,

1089
00:58:02.011 --> 00:58:02.771
that'd be pretty cool.

1090
00:58:02.771 --> 00:58:06.010
But it's like this shows the worst show ever and it gets the best ratings ever.

1091
00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:10.360
Like it's the biggest,
it's the highest rated show.
But sitcoms,
there's only,

1092
00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:13.560
what is the big deal behind the show?
What is,
what do people like about,
you know,

1093
00:58:13.570 --> 00:58:16.630
it's the one liners.
It's the quips.
It's just,
you know,
it's just,

1094
00:58:16.660 --> 00:58:21.400
it appeals to families I guess.
I don't know.
I mean it's kind of,
you know,

1095
00:58:21.401 --> 00:58:24.370
I've watched it because I asked every gride dates for some reason,

1096
00:58:24.371 --> 00:58:26.500
likes that show.
So I have that shit on my DVR.

1097
00:58:26.501 --> 00:58:29.980
So once in a while that's one of my go to bed shows.
Very stupid.

1098
00:58:32.470 --> 00:58:35.590
But,
but like I put it on before,
like before I go to bed.

1099
00:58:35.591 --> 00:58:39.400
And so I ended up like half watching it.
You know,
it's just fucking,

1100
00:58:39.430 --> 00:58:42.130
it's a sitcom,
you know,
it's just,
it's,
it's a,
it's a soup.

1101
00:58:42.131 --> 00:58:45.140
Watched one part of one episode was like,
all right,

1102
00:58:45.150 --> 00:58:48.520
let's see what this is all about.
And I gave it like 15 seconds to fuck my watch.

1103
00:58:48.521 --> 00:58:52.490
I mean,
as a comedian,
you're a teacher.
You just can't,
you just can't.
Honestly,

1104
00:58:52.630 --> 00:58:52.990
like,

1105
00:58:52.990 --> 00:58:57.160
people don't know how hard it is to go from being a comedian to doing shitty

1106
00:58:57.161 --> 00:58:59.460
comedy.
Doing shitty comedy is hard.

1107
00:58:59.490 --> 00:59:02.230
Doing a Shitty Sit-com Shitty sitcoms are brutality.

1108
00:59:02.530 --> 00:59:05.830
They're really hard to do and they're terrible.
You've done sitcoms.

1109
00:59:06.190 --> 00:59:10.630
What was your Shogun for you on a shitty one,
man?
Frank TV that was,

1110
00:59:11.100 --> 00:59:15.520
no,
it wasn't a shitty one,
wasn't it?
No,
it wasn't a,
a decent,
it was decent scale.

1111
00:59:15.521 --> 00:59:19.100
It was small.
I'll say it was small,
so it was like,
you know,
definitely didn't,

1112
00:59:19.330 --> 00:59:21.980
it wasn't like showing up to the set of a major

1113
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:25.130
<v 1>network.
It was TBS,
but I had fun.
It was enjoyable.
But,</v>

1114
00:59:25.310 --> 00:59:26.840
but news radio now that's huge.

1115
00:59:26.841 --> 00:59:29.670
And then what was that like showing it wasn't huge.
We did that become a huge,

1116
00:59:30.150 --> 00:59:32.060
it became huge after while we were on the air.

1117
00:59:32.061 --> 00:59:35.870
I mean we got to syndication barely,
but we like,

1118
00:59:35.871 --> 00:59:38.270
we were suppose to get a hundred episodes.
We accidentally did 98,

1119
00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:40.970
but what happened with news radio is we just kept getting moved.

1120
00:59:40.971 --> 00:59:43.970
We got moved nine times over the course of five seasons.
Yeah.

1121
00:59:43.971 --> 00:59:45.140
We got moved like crazy.

1122
00:59:45.380 --> 00:59:49.610
And you realize that a lot of like what puts a Sitcom and certain places like

1123
00:59:49.611 --> 00:59:51.410
Paul Simms used to talk about it.

1124
00:59:51.411 --> 00:59:54.770
There was the shit sandwich between friends and uh,

1125
00:59:54.771 --> 00:59:57.680
there was something else that was on after friends and was great to something

1126
00:59:57.681 --> 00:59:59.000
else.
It was good.
And they would,

1127
00:59:59.001 --> 01:00:02.840
they would always sandwich these shitty shows in those spots before that.

1128
01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:05.860
And those shows would be huge.
Like,
like,
um,

1129
01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:09.800
there was a one called the single guy that was his terrible show,
you know,

1130
01:00:09.801 --> 01:00:13.160
really nice guy who was the star Jonathan something or another.

1131
01:00:13.260 --> 01:00:16.550
I remember that Super Nice Guy.
But the show was terrible.
It just wasn't good.

1132
01:00:16.551 --> 01:00:21.140
But meanwhile was getting giant monster ratings.
Yes.
So people would watch it.

1133
01:00:21.230 --> 01:00:21.711
And you know,

1134
01:00:21.711 --> 01:00:26.450
sims would pitch and we would get moved around and we were on like Tuesday and

1135
01:00:26.450 --> 01:00:28.100
Sunday and Wednesday and Monday we just got to get moved all over the place and

1136
01:00:28.101 --> 01:00:29.840
no one,
even when the show got canceled,

1137
01:00:30.350 --> 01:00:33.640
it partially was because Phil Hartman got killed.
You know.

1138
01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:35.870
And so the last season we did with love it's,
and the season,

1139
01:00:36.210 --> 01:00:38.360
the last season would,
for a couple reasons wasn't as good.

1140
01:00:38.390 --> 01:00:41.510
It wasn't as good because we had a different executive producer because Paul

1141
01:00:41.510 --> 01:00:44.750
Simms was working on this other thing called overseas that I was the star off.

1142
01:00:44.750 --> 01:00:47.000
It was another sitcom that they were trying to do on NBC.

1143
01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:51.740
And part of it was because Phil was gone and it was a totally different vibe.

1144
01:00:51.770 --> 01:00:54.800
Right.
You know,
so we had,
you know,
Jon Lovitz who was very funny,

1145
01:00:54.801 --> 01:00:57.260
but it's very different and we had to kind of adjust and everything was all

1146
01:00:57.261 --> 01:00:59.930
fucked up.
Cause you know,
just a few months ago,

1147
01:00:59.931 --> 01:01:03.740
the dude was hanging out with us and now he's murdered and we have to like do a

1148
01:01:03.741 --> 01:01:06.950
whole episode where we have to like,
you know,
talk about how he died.

1149
01:01:07.180 --> 01:01:10.310
And then this guy,
the love his character gets introduced.

1150
01:01:10.311 --> 01:01:13.670
And so that was part of the reason why I'm getting canceled.

1151
01:01:13.671 --> 01:01:15.700
But the other reason was it wasn't that successful.
They would,

1152
01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:16.370
they would come in,

1153
01:01:16.370 --> 01:01:20.650
we got moved around so many times the writers would come in like this guy,
uh,
uh,

1154
01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:23.480
Lou Morton who's Hilarious,
very,
very funny,

1155
01:01:23.481 --> 01:01:25.820
right in this motherfucker got me addicted to quake.

1156
01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:28.730
He was the guy who got me addicted because he was really good at and we battled

1157
01:01:28.780 --> 01:01:32.490
back and forth at work cause they had a whole quake lan local area networks set

1158
01:01:32.491 --> 01:01:34.120
up there.
He used to come in,
um,

1159
01:01:34.260 --> 01:01:38.210
on the day of the ratings were released with whatever number we were.

1160
01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:38.931
Cause like it was like,

1161
01:01:38.931 --> 01:01:42.350
it became like a joke written on his t shirt and he came in one day and it said

1162
01:01:42.351 --> 01:01:46.220
88,
88 or 88th.

1163
01:01:46.330 --> 01:01:48.530
And of all the shows on TV where 88 wow.

1164
01:01:48.650 --> 01:01:50.960
Especially what in 97 98 they were there.

1165
01:01:50.961 --> 01:01:55.160
Even that many shows on TV shows see where we're like,
Whoa,
wow,

1166
01:01:55.190 --> 01:01:59.120
eighth or we might've been 84 it was in the eighties I mean the thing is that w

1167
01:01:59.250 --> 01:02:03.050
weren't you just glad to show up and be working in Hollywood?
It's definitely,

1168
01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:05.500
absolutely,
but I'm saying is it just,
I,
I they would,

1169
01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:07.440
people would always bitch people on the site.
It would be like,

1170
01:02:07.441 --> 01:02:09.260
this is fucking bullshit.
You know?
Why does,

1171
01:02:09.261 --> 01:02:11.410
you know if Caroline in the city get to beyond,

1172
01:02:11.420 --> 01:02:12.860
they would call Caroline in the Shitty,

1173
01:02:13.390 --> 01:02:16.190
see the new Promo for Carolina Shinny fun shows.
Terrible.

1174
01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:19.770
There was a lot of that going on.
There's a lot of that going on on the set,

1175
01:02:19.771 --> 01:02:21.900
but there was also a lot of people that were like,
this is,

1176
01:02:21.901 --> 01:02:24.120
we're doing something really special.
This is like a lot of fun.
Well,

1177
01:02:24.150 --> 01:02:25.110
as a comedian too,

1178
01:02:25.111 --> 01:02:29.280
you already have kind of a more of a blue collar work ethic that we have over

1179
01:02:29.281 --> 01:02:31.020
actors I think a lot.
Not all,

1180
01:02:31.430 --> 01:02:35.170
but for sure appreciated it more because I never expected it,
you know,

1181
01:02:35.630 --> 01:02:39.480
and that's different thing.
Actors,
those grow up wanting to be in sitcoms.
Me,

1182
01:02:39.481 --> 01:02:43.200
I was on a sitcom like almost per chance.
Oh Wow.
It's a whole thing became,

1183
01:02:43.290 --> 01:02:45.670
I never took act.
Is it that you heard this story about that?

1184
01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:48.880
That did I hear right that Ray Romano was,
he was the original host.

1185
01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:54.630
They fired him and hired a another actor to do it for the pilot so that then the

1186
01:02:54.631 --> 01:02:58.350
other actor did it for the pilot and then they fired him and hired me.

1187
01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:01.830
So I didn't really take race part.
I took the guy who stole race part.

1188
01:03:01.831 --> 01:03:05.550
Isn't that something how stories work out?
Like just that,
that,
that close.

1189
01:03:05.551 --> 01:03:06.860
That could have been some other than this,

1190
01:03:07.050 --> 01:03:09.510
when they decided to go a different way with it,
they just,
you know,

1191
01:03:09.511 --> 01:03:11.430
it wasn't there.
Ray wasn't good.
It was like,
you know,

1192
01:03:11.431 --> 01:03:14.580
ray was older and was more relaxed and just try it.

1193
01:03:14.790 --> 01:03:19.790
They were trying to figure out the next guy was like the Zany guys and they're

1194
01:03:19.991 --> 01:03:22.170
like,
wow,
that didn't work either.
And then I just got lucky.

1195
01:03:22.170 --> 01:03:25.170
I just came in last year as you're taking a bunch of acting classes.
No,

1196
01:03:25.171 --> 01:03:28.140
I've been on a shitty show though.
I've got a development deal with Fox.

1197
01:03:28.470 --> 01:03:31.410
It was with Disney actually.
And then I was calling the show called hardball.

1198
01:03:31.530 --> 01:03:33.660
This is how bad the show us.
It was a baseball show.

1199
01:03:33.820 --> 01:03:36.630
It was a sick cow and it could have been hilarious cause the guys who originally

1200
01:03:36.631 --> 01:03:38.730
wrote it,
this guy's named Jeff Martin and Kevin Curran,

1201
01:03:39.030 --> 01:03:41.640
they were writers for the Simpsons and they wrote from married with children

1202
01:03:41.641 --> 01:03:44.670
that were brilliant.
They wrote a brilliant pilot.
The pilot was hilarious.

1203
01:03:44.970 --> 01:03:48.090
Jim Brewer was in the pilot,
so Algebra and uh,

1204
01:03:48.150 --> 01:03:50.560
Mike Star and you might have seen him,
he was in good fellows,

1205
01:03:50.570 --> 01:03:53.980
has been a bunch of movies and Bruce Greenwood and it was not a good,

1206
01:03:54.050 --> 01:03:57.890
good cast to go like good.
Alexandra went worth.
But the,
the,

1207
01:03:57.891 --> 01:04:02.610
the real problem was with the network and with,
uh,
they didn't want these guys,

1208
01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:05.160
Jeff and Kevin to be the producers of the show because they didn't think they

1209
01:04:05.161 --> 01:04:07.420
knew how to run a show.
So they brought in this other dude.

1210
01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:11.250
The other dude just started fucking hacking it up,
uh,
it up,

1211
01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:16.110
taking scripts and just butchering them and just terrible jokes.

1212
01:04:16.111 --> 01:04:19.950
And he would go and do coke on his yacht with this girl who was playing my

1213
01:04:19.951 --> 01:04:23.520
girlfriend in the,
in the,
in this,
uh,
first episode,
he,
uh,

1214
01:04:23.550 --> 01:04:26.280
he became friends with his check and we'd take her on his yacht and they would

1215
01:04:26.281 --> 01:04:30.300
write and he would do blown fucker and back with the worst crawl time.

1216
01:04:30.450 --> 01:04:34.540
But when they would come back,
like she would have like more reliance on God.

1217
01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:38.220
And finally it got to,

1218
01:04:38.310 --> 01:04:43.050
we filmed a few episodes with this guy and he was so hated and it was so the,

1219
01:04:43.051 --> 01:04:46.550
the,
the tension on the set was so bad that they decided to fire him.

1220
01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:51.240
They got him and they brought in another guy and the other guy closed it out.

1221
01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:54.260
And it was,
but it was only eight episodes,
only seven.
I'm aired and it was death.

1222
01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:58.230
It was,
and I was done with that.
I was like,
fuck acting.
This is terrible acting.

1223
01:04:58.380 --> 01:05:00.540
This is the shit you have to deal with.
I was ready to go back to New York,

1224
01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:04.800
but I fucked up and got a whole year lease on this apartment.
I couldn't afford.

1225
01:05:04.801 --> 01:05:07.800
I was ready to go back.
I was like,
this is,
I'm done.
I'm a comedian,
man.

1226
01:05:08.110 --> 01:05:13.110
That turned off by it.
I was totally ready to go and then all of a sudden,
boom,

1227
01:05:13.170 --> 01:05:16.410
I auditioned for news radio and I'm on it.
I mean,
literally like a month later,

1228
01:05:16.470 --> 01:05:18.190
I'm on this show and it's,
I'm fucking

1229
01:05:18.190 --> 01:05:21.820
<v 3>working with Phil Hartman.
So I go from never taking an acting class,</v>

1230
01:05:21.850 --> 01:05:23.710
never even thinking about doing,
acting,

1231
01:05:23.980 --> 01:05:27.340
doing stand up at fucking Jimmy's comedy alley and Queens.

1232
01:05:27.670 --> 01:05:29.450
And then a week later,
you know,

1233
01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:32.020
I'm in Hollywood and two months later I'm sitting across the table,

1234
01:05:32.021 --> 01:05:35.230
read from Phil Hartman going,
what the fuck is going on here?

1235
01:05:35.290 --> 01:05:39.130
That's of course should it was business.
I was be beyond bizarre.
Yeah,

1236
01:05:39.131 --> 01:05:41.770
that's cool.
You've lived like a multiple lives.

1237
01:05:41.771 --> 01:05:45.800
It seems like you're accomplished in multiple arenas where it's like a,

1238
01:05:46.090 --> 01:05:49.060
you did this,
done with that,
do this,
done with that.
It's like,

1239
01:05:49.061 --> 01:05:52.810
I think that's the thing about life.
You have to keep trying new shit.

1240
01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:53.800
Like there's so many things,

1241
01:05:53.801 --> 01:05:55.950
like a lot of times I'll say I want to get into this,
but it like,
like,

1242
01:05:56.020 --> 01:05:59.650
like my life's over.
I'm 31 it'd be like,
why not?
Why not?
You get to do anything.

1243
01:05:59.830 --> 01:06:02.800
You Know How many times I've contemplate playing professional pool,

1244
01:06:03.100 --> 01:06:05.920
I stop and think about how much money would it have to squirrel away for a year

1245
01:06:05.921 --> 01:06:09.310
to join the pro tour.
Right.
And,
and,
and,
and try to practice eight,

1246
01:06:09.311 --> 01:06:11.770
10 hours a day and try to make a run at playing pool and just play,

1247
01:06:11.771 --> 01:06:12.680
cause I just want to play tonight.

1248
01:06:12.710 --> 01:06:14.470
Do you know you got it in you because that's a thing.

1249
01:06:14.471 --> 01:06:15.970
It's like you get that feeling.

1250
01:06:15.971 --> 01:06:17.560
It's like when you come and you do something like this,

1251
01:06:17.561 --> 01:06:20.140
like in Hollywood or accomplished yourself in a sport,
you know,

1252
01:06:20.141 --> 01:06:23.350
when you become the elite of your company,
it's like you want to do it again.

1253
01:06:23.380 --> 01:06:24.720
You want to find some different things.

1254
01:06:24.890 --> 01:06:27.790
It's like guys who become scratch golfers like I think Justin Timberlake or

1255
01:06:27.791 --> 01:06:31.180
somebody almost like a scratch golfer at this point.
Like he's,
he's really good.

1256
01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:34.380
I'm like obsessed with it.
I'm like,
he kinda should be.
You know what I mean?

1257
01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:38.470
A mother fucker.
Yeah.
It's Musashi's quote.
Once you understand the way broadly,

1258
01:06:38.471 --> 01:06:39.940
you can see it in all things.

1259
01:06:40.180 --> 01:06:44.360
That's more one of my favorite quotes and it's all about a pal.

1260
01:06:44.380 --> 01:06:47.860
Recognizing what it takes to really master something really takes to get in tune

1261
01:06:47.861 --> 01:06:50.320
with what is great about something.
The Buddhist says,

1262
01:06:50.530 --> 01:06:53.260
if you want to know how good you're doing it something,
look back every 10 years.

1263
01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:54.700
That's another one.
That's one.

1264
01:06:54.701 --> 01:06:57.370
I love that because that takes 10 years to see your progress,

1265
01:06:58.090 --> 01:07:01.090
which he always been step looking back into your progress and just keep thinking

1266
01:07:01.110 --> 01:07:03.040
it right now.
God Damn Tricky Buddhist,

1267
01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:07.270
God dammit it was Johnny Appleseed seed real or is that just a fictional

1268
01:07:07.271 --> 01:07:10.690
character is real and the story is bullshit.
What is the story?

1269
01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:14.020
The story is that he sprinkled seeds basically all throughout the what?

1270
01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:17.130
What was it?
The western state from across the,
the,
the,

1271
01:07:17.131 --> 01:07:19.090
the neue when the Louisiana purchase happened,

1272
01:07:19.091 --> 01:07:21.500
I think he went just go sprinkling seeds like all men are next.

1273
01:07:23.060 --> 01:07:25.900
They said something,
they said,
I saw a thing about seeds and they're like,

1274
01:07:25.901 --> 01:07:30.190
apples don't grow that way.
Certain seeds or don't go in certain regions,

1275
01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:33.880
the first one dies,
you know,
and it's like there's a real maintenance.

1276
01:07:33.910 --> 01:07:37.750
You don't just spring an apple tree is a,
is a very,
is a hard fucking thing.

1277
01:07:37.751 --> 01:07:40.630
It's almost like a baby being born.
A lot of shit has to go right.

1278
01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:41.630
You know what I mean?

1279
01:07:41.630 --> 01:07:45.400
Apple trees are hard to pull off and they said that him just going around doing

1280
01:07:45.401 --> 01:07:48.220
that all it would create,
it's like sour grape size apples.

1281
01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:49.660
Like it just doesn't work that way.

1282
01:07:49.661 --> 01:07:52.180
You've got to cultivate you gotta you gotta know what you're doing.

1283
01:07:52.181 --> 01:07:55.750
So do you think he spent time to actually plan to properly or you just didn't

1284
01:07:55.751 --> 01:07:57.670
really do it and he was just trying to get attention?

1285
01:07:57.700 --> 01:08:01.750
I think he set up the one actual little farm for himself.
But like I said,

1286
01:08:01.751 --> 01:08:05.110
the second generation don't give off as good as the first and you have to stick

1287
01:08:05.111 --> 01:08:05.921
around and maintain that.

1288
01:08:05.921 --> 01:08:09.880
They act like he's just sprinkled it along the countryside wearing a pot on his

1289
01:08:09.881 --> 01:08:13.990
head.
Maybe it was just his song to promote his apple farm that he did like.

1290
01:08:14.020 --> 01:08:14.501
I think he's,

1291
01:08:14.501 --> 01:08:18.450
I think it's the legend is up there with like Paul Bunyan pretty much watch,

1292
01:08:18.590 --> 01:08:22.820
watch,
watch.
Shelly Appleseed has great,
great grand out her mother fucker.

1293
01:08:22.850 --> 01:08:23.683
Do you think,

1294
01:08:23.870 --> 01:08:27.200
do you think that you would just get used to live in like people live back in

1295
01:08:27.201 --> 01:08:29.580
those days?
I mean,
does it,

1296
01:08:29.590 --> 01:08:34.100
do people just get used to it or do you think it was like life sock back then?

1297
01:08:34.310 --> 01:08:38.440
Did they know where they,
their
life is too fucking hard.
Thanks.

1298
01:08:38.490 --> 01:08:39.323
So I think what those,

1299
01:08:39.350 --> 01:08:41.570
those pioneers and the people who came out to settle the west,

1300
01:08:41.571 --> 01:08:42.890
I mean it's like big balls,
you know,

1301
01:08:42.891 --> 01:08:46.070
I give them big credit for that because it's like they came down to s you know

1302
01:08:46.071 --> 01:08:49.820
the soil and like North Dakota,
like you can't get through that shit.

1303
01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:55.480
Good luck farming with horses and they were saying like the number of people

1304
01:08:55.851 --> 01:08:57.140
coming out were just dying in droves,

1305
01:08:57.141 --> 01:09:00.500
but the ones that they finally tackled it and got it going,
you know,

1306
01:09:00.501 --> 01:09:03.830
those are the ones who who obviously survived and later thrive,

1307
01:09:03.860 --> 01:09:07.500
but I wouldn't want to try that shit.
Crazy life.
There was a,

1308
01:09:07.570 --> 01:09:10.730
there was a thing they did on a national geographic is something as a reality

1309
01:09:10.731 --> 01:09:13.880
show,
but it was like,
it was basically a survivor but no prize to be won.

1310
01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:17.390
They just throw you out here,
you got to survive in Alaska.
So I'm watched that.

1311
01:09:17.391 --> 01:09:20.570
I watched the whole thing.
It was fucking great dude.
It really taught,

1312
01:09:20.571 --> 01:09:22.910
it talks about like dudes were getting hungry like in the first six hours,

1313
01:09:22.940 --> 01:09:24.370
like didn't do this shit.

1314
01:09:24.371 --> 01:09:27.350
And then when like even I'm real big like this cop dude,

1315
01:09:27.351 --> 01:09:30.160
like he couldn't hack it after awhile,
but ladies were able to hack it.

1316
01:09:30.161 --> 01:09:34.550
It was just they were killing squirrels with their bare hands to eat and they

1317
01:09:34.551 --> 01:09:35.750
quickly adapted to that.

1318
01:09:35.751 --> 01:09:39.890
When you say like after the first week all s civility goes out the window.

1319
01:09:39.891 --> 01:09:42.710
No more table manners or watched one of the first episodes only,

1320
01:09:42.711 --> 01:09:44.030
but they couldn't find anything to kill.

1321
01:09:44.031 --> 01:09:45.620
They killed a squirrel and it fell in a hole,

1322
01:09:45.970 --> 01:09:47.680
shot it and it fell in a hole and he couldn't get,

1323
01:09:47.820 --> 01:09:51.910
I couldn't get to and they were just,
there was nothing delirious.

1324
01:09:51.950 --> 01:09:55.820
Like you have to start to training your body in this sick way to to just take

1325
01:09:55.821 --> 01:09:58.790
one morsel of something and,
and maximize your shit.

1326
01:09:58.791 --> 01:10:02.150
They'd get a kill finally and they'd make a stew because stu will go further and

1327
01:10:02.151 --> 01:10:04.280
you can transport a stew because that's the thing too.

1328
01:10:04.281 --> 01:10:06.250
You've got to bring your food with you.
You know,

1329
01:10:06.260 --> 01:10:09.600
if you kill something and they eat a fucking eight a porcupine.
Yeah.

1330
01:10:09.620 --> 01:10:12.470
It was the most disgusting looking thing when they feel dressed,
this thing,

1331
01:10:12.471 --> 01:10:16.580
things spilled out of there.
I'd never seen in my life,
porcupine.

1332
01:10:18.930 --> 01:10:21.200
I don't remember.
It was something about Alaska.

1333
01:10:21.201 --> 01:10:24.410
Just something as I think I've got it saved him.
Yeah,
it was good.

1334
01:10:24.411 --> 01:10:26.550
I watched the whole thing.
It was pretty damn good.

1335
01:10:26.551 --> 01:10:30.610
And in the end they were in Macy's looking.
They looked horrible.
Yeah.

1336
01:10:30.650 --> 01:10:33.800
There's a guy we've talked about on the show that you ever go to that website,

1337
01:10:33.801 --> 01:10:35.030
vbs.tv.

1338
01:10:35.630 --> 01:10:39.920
There's a the vice guide to travel as a whole series of they do online.

1339
01:10:39.921 --> 01:10:42.860
It's great.
Great stuff.
And one of them,
they went to this guy,

1340
01:10:43.100 --> 01:10:46.130
I think his name is Huynh Mo.
It's,
you've got to,
it's a strange name,

1341
01:10:46.340 --> 01:10:49.640
but this guy lives in like North Eastern Alaska.

1342
01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:54.620
He lives in like this area where you're like only a few people that permission

1343
01:10:54.621 --> 01:10:57.180
to still live up there.
And he lives in this one room cabin.
Oh.

1344
01:10:57.360 --> 01:10:59.060
And he's been up there for 30 years.

1345
01:10:59.210 --> 01:11:02.240
This guy literally never saw the towers fall,
you know,

1346
01:11:02.241 --> 01:11:03.380
and he can speak good English.

1347
01:11:03.381 --> 01:11:07.070
He's a very intelligent guy and he lives his life just hunting and gathering,

1348
01:11:07.071 --> 01:11:09.410
just following Caribou around,
shooting him.

1349
01:11:09.411 --> 01:11:11.690
He has a couple of cabins that he walks too.
He has no car.

1350
01:11:12.050 --> 01:11:14.340
He does everything on foot.
He gets supplies

1351
01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:18.100
<v 1>dropped,
he gets like bullets and and and,</v>

1352
01:11:18.101 --> 01:11:21.160
and I guess he must get some vegetables.
I don't know what happens there.

1353
01:11:21.270 --> 01:11:22.830
I don't know if he gets canned vegetables,

1354
01:11:22.831 --> 01:11:25.140
but he's not eating any vegetables on the show.

1355
01:11:25.141 --> 01:11:28.710
What do you always eating is Caribou that he kills and a and fish that he

1356
01:11:28.711 --> 01:11:31.180
catches and that's,
that's what he does every day.

1357
01:11:31.210 --> 01:11:33.220
Every day following carob around shooting.

1358
01:11:33.300 --> 01:11:36.540
But he's a very bright guy and when he's talking he says that,

1359
01:11:36.541 --> 01:11:38.530
you know that men got away from the whole hunting

1360
01:11:38.630 --> 01:11:40.410
<v 5>gathering thing.
What is a</v>

1361
01:11:43.430 --> 01:11:48.080
firearm?
Firearm?

1362
01:11:48.950 --> 01:11:49.783
I don't know what that is.

1363
01:11:51.670 --> 01:11:55.490
<v 1>Oh,
it's a water or water thing raising.
He knows up pipe.</v>

1364
01:11:55.990 --> 01:11:59.660
I thought it was a cover of a fuck kind of show.
Is this dude that this is,

1365
01:11:59.661 --> 01:12:03.480
that's how ghetto the show is.
My pipes are making crazy.
No,
that's crazy.

1366
01:12:03.500 --> 01:12:07.580
I thought,
oh that's the inhouse vacuum cleaner.
It's been fucking up lately.

1367
01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:10.390
He has these vacuum cleaners where they'll just blog.

1368
01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:16.160
I've heard tale of those before and it was cool to actually see what this house

1369
01:12:16.161 --> 01:12:20.750
is the shit.
But that's what it was.
Cool.
This is think,
thank God you got that.
Uh,

1370
01:12:20.751 --> 01:12:24.830
that audition that it all worked out for money.
Yeah.
Well,

1371
01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:28.160
the reason why I was willing to do something like fear factor was after doing

1372
01:12:28.220 --> 01:12:31.940
like a bad sitcom and then entertain the idea of doing another bad sitcom

1373
01:12:31.941 --> 01:12:35.240
afternoons radio,
I was like,
I'd rather do something that's not funny at all.

1374
01:12:35.710 --> 01:12:38.960
You know?
I'd rather do.
What else can I do to get paid?

1375
01:12:38.990 --> 01:12:42.290
I can do this and you'll pay me.
Let's do this.
You can do that too.

1376
01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:44.480
I know as a comic,
I don't watch comedy.

1377
01:12:44.481 --> 01:12:47.060
I can't stand it and they won't make me laugh.
I don't like drama.
And I'm like,

1378
01:12:47.980 --> 01:12:51.200
I like the over,
hang over.
It was hilarious.
Movies are always good.
They don't,

1379
01:12:51.230 --> 01:12:52.520
they don't,
they don't screw you over.

1380
01:12:52.521 --> 01:12:55.770
They're not trying to fit in a laugh every minute and 10 seconds.
Right,
right.

1381
01:12:55.820 --> 01:12:57.860
They're trying to make a good story.
They can do a good story.

1382
01:12:57.861 --> 01:13:01.010
And I liked gala finac it's Ilana.
I think he's,
he's,
have you seen the new one?

1383
01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:05.580
Is it good?
I heard Brody's to Damon it,
bro.
You so great.
The protein.

1384
01:13:06.970 --> 01:13:10.280
Brent is easy,
so it said it was really good.
Lucky you can't go wrong.

1385
01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:11.540
Calvin acas,
he's just funny.

1386
01:13:11.570 --> 01:13:14.090
He's going to be like make a real mark like a Bill Murray.

1387
01:13:14.091 --> 01:13:18.560
I think I already like that.
The way people love him.
He's already a little bit,

1388
01:13:18.561 --> 01:13:21.080
the whole stink though that he would.
Then Bill Murray,
obviously he's a legend.

1389
01:13:21.290 --> 01:13:25.220
Absolutely is in when Bill Murray was coming up and he was in that,
that vibe,

1390
01:13:25.221 --> 01:13:27.820
you know like when stripes was,
you remember striking?
Absolutely.

1391
01:13:27.830 --> 01:13:29.560
When stripes is coming out man,
Bill Murray was there.

1392
01:13:29.561 --> 01:13:31.350
Like anything you could say was funny.
Yeah,

1393
01:13:31.460 --> 01:13:34.040
it would watch him and Galvin Atkins is like right here.
It's getting there.

1394
01:13:34.041 --> 01:13:36.800
I watched it.
I Never Watch standup comedy and I watched it,

1395
01:13:36.801 --> 01:13:38.210
but one night I was watching Netflix.
I was like,

1396
01:13:38.211 --> 01:13:39.560
I'll check him out at the purple onion.

1397
01:13:39.580 --> 01:13:42.470
It was like I was genuinely laughing my ass off.

1398
01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:45.880
He's very fun [inaudible] in as a,
as a performer I watched,
you know,
it's,

1399
01:13:45.881 --> 01:13:49.310
it's a very precise craft,
that thing that he does and he's really good at it.

1400
01:13:49.311 --> 01:13:51.620
You know what I mean?
To the point where I can respect and be like,
oh wow,

1401
01:13:51.650 --> 01:13:53.330
because there's a comedian,
it's like a magician.
It's like,
oh,

1402
01:13:53.331 --> 01:13:55.580
I know how he did it.
Right.
Well I see that.
That's great.
Good job.

1403
01:13:55.790 --> 01:13:57.350
But I was literally laughing.
I was like,

1404
01:13:57.351 --> 01:14:01.910
who makes you laugh the most besides mean guys like you Brodie,

1405
01:14:02.060 --> 01:14:06.170
obviously your friends.
I still laugh.
Like Brody,

1406
01:14:06.230 --> 01:14:10.160
he's probably the biggest on spoken treasure bro.
He probably,

1407
01:14:10.161 --> 01:14:12.090
he just gets to of us.
And the thing about Brody's

1408
01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:14.200
<v 3>you have to see him live.
I think you and I talked about that.</v>

1409
01:14:14.201 --> 01:14:17.690
You have to see him in person to get the joke because people who just feel them

1410
01:14:17.691 --> 01:14:18.580
online or something,
they don't,

1411
01:14:18.581 --> 01:14:20.560
there's something missing in the two dimensional world.

1412
01:14:20.561 --> 01:14:24.430
You have to see and feel and know the mannerisms and see that this is a

1413
01:14:24.431 --> 01:14:29.170
character.
But it,
goddammit,
is this character always,
you know,
being attended to.

1414
01:14:29.171 --> 01:14:34.040
It's like,
okay,
hold on,
I'm going to put a stop.
No,
stop talking.
So,
um,

1415
01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:37.940
he makes me laugh.
A pill per makes me laugh a lot.
Belper Vars,
lawyers,

1416
01:14:38.130 --> 01:14:41.650
I was always writing type of hood.
Has mentioned that,
that he's the best,

1417
01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:43.200
one of the best right now.
And you know,

1418
01:14:43.220 --> 01:14:45.400
people were starting to say that and it's like you get some knee deep and you

1419
01:14:45.401 --> 01:14:48.850
don't even like,
capital was my best friend.
And it's like,
I forget,
I forget,

1420
01:14:48.851 --> 01:14:52.900
he's famous now.
It's like,
it's weird.
It's like we go places and he gets mobbed.

1421
01:14:52.901 --> 01:14:55.930
I'm like,
wow.
From the Chelsea handler show.
Yeah.
Big Time that,
that,

1422
01:14:55.931 --> 01:14:58.630
that seemed to just put him through the roof and now he's doing great on the

1423
01:14:58.631 --> 01:15:02.350
road.
He's happy.
He just got engaged the other day.
Uh,
that should work out well.

1424
01:15:02.380 --> 01:15:05.530
Yeah.
And her,
most of the beach,
he got engaged.
Um,

1425
01:15:05.710 --> 01:15:07.520
and she got to let them play Xbox and

1426
01:15:10.350 --> 01:15:14.140
we'll still play Madden,
I'm sure.
But we'll play online.
But it's like,
uh,

1427
01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:15.480
you know,
I,

1428
01:15:15.790 --> 01:15:18.890
things make me laugh that sometimes it's not even a person or a comedian.

1429
01:15:18.891 --> 01:15:23.020
It's a dog.
Dogs make me my dog.
Right.
I mean,
like with standups,
like,

1430
01:15:23.260 --> 01:15:28.120
like do you like Patton Oswald?
I do Louie and off and on,
off and on.

1431
01:15:28.390 --> 01:15:30.470
I,
you know,
when he's one of my favorite spam,
the con,

1432
01:15:30.550 --> 01:15:34.690
the Comedians of comedy tour,
um,
you know,
I liked it a lot.
I like a um,

1433
01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:37.880
cause Guelph,
NAC has,
did some work on that one and then who is it?

1434
01:15:37.990 --> 01:15:41.560
Who are the other nerds?
Brian was saying,
yeah,
he's great.

1435
01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:44.110
I like Patanol is what I do cause he appeals to comedians.

1436
01:15:44.111 --> 01:15:48.580
It's just sometimes you just a little to me I think he's,
I,

1437
01:15:48.740 --> 01:15:52.470
he's comfortable,
comfortable with brilliant.
He,
he did this big,

1438
01:15:53.890 --> 01:15:56.590
he did this bit that I fucking one of those.

1439
01:15:56.591 --> 01:15:59.830
I wish I thought of that because I've often thought about it but I never thought

1440
01:15:59.831 --> 01:16:03.490
it was funny about how all those stores like on Melrose and stuff.

1441
01:16:03.491 --> 01:16:04.360
Like you're like how did it,

1442
01:16:04.420 --> 01:16:08.080
how did these places pay for their rent and was selling candles?
You know,

1443
01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:12.310
it's probably like $3,000 and it is a whole bid on that and fucking brilliant.

1444
01:16:12.990 --> 01:16:15.550
You know,
I think he said that was one that you just made up that night.

1445
01:16:15.550 --> 01:16:18.580
You see the kid and he's a writer,
a good writer.

1446
01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:21.760
You see the kid who ripped him off and was doing his job,
so that was hilarious.

1447
01:16:21.950 --> 01:16:23.770
It was like,
look,
you're not,
kids had ripped him off.

1448
01:16:23.771 --> 01:16:27.670
One kid ripped him off during a commencement speech or some sort of a graduation

1449
01:16:27.671 --> 01:16:32.650
speech.
Right.
Can you do that?
He fucked up and it was one that's online,
man.

1450
01:16:32.651 --> 01:16:35.890
It's like a fucking like especially now.
See that's what the Internet is doing.

1451
01:16:35.891 --> 01:16:37.090
It's eradicating liars.

1452
01:16:37.091 --> 01:16:40.360
It's getting rid of liars or at least there's a major reference point here.

1453
01:16:40.361 --> 01:16:42.010
It's like,
you know,
cause remember like when you were a kid,

1454
01:16:42.250 --> 01:16:44.890
you know there'd be kid and your fifth grade,
my dad please for the Raiders.

1455
01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:47.860
It's like,
I'm pretty sure he doesn't,
but I can't really prove that wrong.

1456
01:16:47.861 --> 01:16:51.010
But it's like now you can prove the person wrong on the spot.

1457
01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:52.690
There's some crazy liars out there.
Marijuana.

1458
01:16:52.691 --> 01:16:55.510
I remember one time I was at this club in Florida and this guy goes,
yeah,

1459
01:16:55.511 --> 01:16:58.750
my boys on the flat mother phoned my boy for chocolate l before beat them back

1460
01:16:58.751 --> 01:17:02.140
in [inaudible] 99 you know,
he's like 99 or whatever the fuck the date was,

1461
01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:05.380
so I get on the phone,
this guy,
I go,
what's up?
He goes,
yeah,
yeah.

1462
01:17:05.381 --> 01:17:09.010
Full chocolate Dell,
chill,
fuck chocolate dough.
What happened?

1463
01:17:09.020 --> 01:17:11.030
I stopped him start.
What year was this?

1464
01:17:11.510 --> 01:17:14.390
It tells me the Argo that that didn't happen.
I go,
the only people,

1465
01:17:14.391 --> 01:17:18.610
Chuck's last two at the time was Jeremy Horn and he had just lost to Randy.

1466
01:17:19.530 --> 01:17:23.110
Doesn't only people,
he's lost two.
What he talking about,
man?
No Man.

1467
01:17:23.790 --> 01:17:27.890
It like this guy just made something up just to keep the lately crazy story up

1468
01:17:27.891 --> 01:17:30.940
about about fighting chocolate down.
It was like totally artificial.
Yes.

1469
01:17:31.550 --> 01:17:34.510
Don't you think they'd document something that important?
You know?
Yeah.

1470
01:17:34.590 --> 01:17:37.850
It's just like how people come up to you and they're always like saying,
dude,

1471
01:17:38.300 --> 01:17:39.620
my friend used to hang out with you.

1472
01:17:39.621 --> 01:17:42.620
There's just these stories that people tell people.
They get like,

1473
01:17:42.770 --> 01:17:46.220
I was partying with him in Vegas.
What'd you,
you're going back to the room doors.

1474
01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:48.110
Hilarious.
I found out what a great jokes.

1475
01:17:48.140 --> 01:17:49.940
I found out exactly what the shit tastes like.

1476
01:17:49.941 --> 01:17:54.941
The C two o water drink it and think of serial water serial Miro milk after

1477
01:17:55.620 --> 01:17:58.220
Gordon Graham's because like that,
that's why it's delicious.

1478
01:17:58.250 --> 01:18:02.100
It's healthy for you too.
It's all real pure coconut water at a coconut.

1479
01:18:02.150 --> 01:18:04.510
Some good shit.
Where do you get that at all online.

1480
01:18:05.790 --> 01:18:07.460
Some dude got it in in La,

1481
01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:09.730
but I don't know what store he got it from and he brought it to Jujitsu and he's

1482
01:18:09.740 --> 01:18:10.550
handed them out.

1483
01:18:10.550 --> 01:18:13.700
They actually sell him at the nutrition stores and I just found out today.
Yeah,

1484
01:18:13.701 --> 01:18:15.050
it's like pretty good.

1485
01:18:15.140 --> 01:18:17.860
$2 a bottle should be getting a cut from this that we should podcast.

1486
01:18:17.861 --> 01:18:21.540
It should get sponsors.
Bullshit.
You got to get them.
You got to get free shit.

1487
01:18:21.541 --> 01:18:23.660
Less light and coconut water.
So,
you know,

1488
01:18:23.661 --> 01:18:26.900
I just realized talking to you about impressions,
you know,
I don't,

1489
01:18:27.080 --> 01:18:29.360
I've never practiced any of the impressions that I've done.

1490
01:18:29.390 --> 01:18:31.550
I just do them like with Joey Diaz or something like that.

1491
01:18:31.551 --> 01:18:34.490
I just know I can do it and I just do it.
Are you that way too?

1492
01:18:34.491 --> 01:18:36.020
Like you hear someone talk?
Yeah,

1493
01:18:36.021 --> 01:18:38.420
I think it's like you got to get out of your own way.

1494
01:18:38.450 --> 01:18:42.240
You just let it filter in and come out.
Come out here.
You know,
cause it's like,

1495
01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:45.020
like you'll hear it.
If you try to scrutinize it,

1496
01:18:45.021 --> 01:18:48.880
you'll really start to fuck it up.
You know,
I'll,

1497
01:18:48.910 --> 01:18:51.830
I'll listen to them on headphones and if I don't hear my voice anymore,

1498
01:18:51.831 --> 01:18:55.810
that means I've matched it low.
It means I've matched it.

1499
01:18:55.811 --> 01:18:58.740
It looks like the Morgan Freeman and I started working on an eighth grade.

1500
01:18:58.741 --> 01:19:02.240
I'm here that way.
I now hold on Joe Rogan.
Let me get to that.

1501
01:19:02.990 --> 01:19:07.040
Let's say here there's a fella named Morgan Freeman and I started working on the

1502
01:19:07.041 --> 01:19:11.060
impression when I was in the eighth grade.
Yes sir.
I was about 14 years old,

1503
01:19:11.210 --> 01:19:15.770
jerked off seven times a day to bad.
It's creepy.
And it took me forever.

1504
01:19:15.830 --> 01:19:18.590
What happens?
Creep.
And the way I finally perfected it,

1505
01:19:18.591 --> 01:19:22.880
when it was like 22 I saw Ben Affleck on,
on,
on um,
Dave Letterman,

1506
01:19:22.881 --> 01:19:25.490
and he was doing a Morgan Freeman impression,
but it was horrible.

1507
01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:28.490
But he was doing one thing.
I wasn't doing it right.
It's that thing.

1508
01:19:28.491 --> 01:19:31.580
It's all in here.
He was adding that everything else was wrong.

1509
01:19:31.970 --> 01:19:34.400
And I married the two and I was talking like Morgan Freeman all day.

1510
01:19:34.401 --> 01:19:39.180
I was calling restaurants,
but like,
I'd like to get a table for two planes.
Like,

1511
01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:42.440
okay,
Mr. Freeman,
I was testing it out and I was like,
oh my God.
Oh,
amazing.

1512
01:19:42.710 --> 01:19:43.461
So when I nailed one,

1513
01:19:43.461 --> 01:19:46.610
I've been working on a Tom Hanks for years and I still can't get it.

1514
01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:50.000
There's something,
but he's one of those like ice tea,
like Morgan Freeman.

1515
01:19:50.001 --> 01:19:52.920
Everybody knows who he is,
but nobody does.
And you know,

1516
01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:57.290
and it's somewhere in here.
I found that I can,
I can go back and forth with it,

1517
01:19:57.291 --> 01:19:59.440
but it's,
it's,
you'll miss it a little.
Yeah.

1518
01:19:59.940 --> 01:20:03.270
I'm game show host d with it right now,
but it's like there's scale.

1519
01:20:03.770 --> 01:20:08.010
There's World War II,
Tom Hanks who's very solemn and talks about war II.
But

1520
01:20:08.010 --> 01:20:11.160
<v 1>then there's,
you know,
I'm on Conan O'brien.
Like the shape of your head is wrong.</v>

1521
01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:15.900
I can make that noise.
That is,
I think that has a lot to do with impressions.

1522
01:20:16.080 --> 01:20:18.270
There's certain impressions that I can do that other people can't do.

1523
01:20:18.540 --> 01:20:20.190
I think it's the shape of my face.
There's money,

1524
01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:25.000
there's ways you can open your throat.
I mean,
luck until he was 12 book.

1525
01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:29.340
Definitely.
You know,
you can move.
Contort your mouth.
Like biggie smalls.

1526
01:20:29.341 --> 01:20:31.350
That's totally working on little person one time too.

1527
01:20:31.630 --> 01:20:33.510
And I found out how to sound like a Fackler.

1528
01:20:36.490 --> 01:20:38.160
Contort your mouth.
Be Rough,
man.

1529
01:20:47.250 --> 01:20:49.860
Much love Ralphie.
If you listen,
you know we love you.

1530
01:20:50.190 --> 01:20:54.430
He said Cartman on us as the Obama off.
He smokes more weed than any of them.

1531
01:20:54.460 --> 01:20:57.350
Oh did you hear the story about him getting caught?
Brilliant.

1532
01:20:57.970 --> 01:21:02.160
Pet the dog and my man is bringing weed across the world.

1533
01:21:02.490 --> 01:21:06.000
That's correct.
That's risky.
Don't you know anybody there?
You know,

1534
01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:10.110
I would much rather try to find a connect.
Then you can find a connect man.

1535
01:21:10.111 --> 01:21:14.010
Trust me,
they're growing that shit like crazy out there.

1536
01:21:14.070 --> 01:21:17.500
Big Time and it probably goes well.
It's a cash crop son.

1537
01:21:18.060 --> 01:21:19.750
Number one cash crop in Hawaiian.
They,

1538
01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:22.290
they're trying to eradicate it all the time today.
By the way,

1539
01:21:22.291 --> 01:21:25.090
he proposition 19 today.
It all goes down.
How's it looking as you,

1540
01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:29.110
when has been tracking me I their discover and post is keeping a latest news is

1541
01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:32.070
a way to score.
If it,
if it loses,

1542
01:21:32.071 --> 01:21:36.390
it will mark how oppressed we truly are going to pass.

1543
01:21:36.391 --> 01:21:37.990
I don't pass.

1544
01:21:38.380 --> 01:21:40.800
I think it's going to be like the Gava we all thought that was going to pass.

1545
01:21:40.801 --> 01:21:42.390
You know,
and I'm just basing it on,

1546
01:21:42.391 --> 01:21:45.210
there hasn't even been advertised and there's not been some big push for it.

1547
01:21:45.211 --> 01:21:46.950
It's,
it seems like it's definitely,
you know,

1548
01:21:46.951 --> 01:21:48.510
and then there's a lot of people against it.

1549
01:21:48.511 --> 01:21:51.630
A lot of the growers obviously cause who benefits during prohibition.

1550
01:21:51.631 --> 01:21:55.020
That's the problem.
You know,
growers,
a lot of the medical people are against it.

1551
01:21:55.980 --> 01:21:59.310
I don't know man.
I think it's evolution.
I understand their position.

1552
01:21:59.311 --> 01:22:01.770
I feel bad for doctors that had been prescribing.
We'd,

1553
01:22:01.771 --> 01:22:03.480
if it becomes legal then all of a sudden,
hey,

1554
01:22:03.481 --> 01:22:06.510
where's my business not making all my money sticking my neck out there

1555
01:22:06.511 --> 01:22:09.600
prescribing weed.
Right.
I gotta go back to giving kids bandaids.

1556
01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:11.300
What the fuck man.
You know,

1557
01:22:11.970 --> 01:22:15.360
maybe it will lower the cost of health care because they all have to go be

1558
01:22:15.361 --> 01:22:17.040
doctors again and there's more doctors.

1559
01:22:17.100 --> 01:22:19.830
How does that benefit that doctor just lost a job,
Brian?
This is a logical,

1560
01:22:20.190 --> 01:22:21.450
I think,
uh,
you know,

1561
01:22:21.451 --> 01:22:23.700
they just need to figure out another way to become a part of the system.

1562
01:22:23.701 --> 01:22:26.340
So selling it man,
fucking dispensary.

1563
01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:29.130
And you know what's funny on the other side is a cops or you know,

1564
01:22:29.131 --> 01:22:31.650
obviously they want it to be illegal so they don't have to deal with this.

1565
01:22:31.651 --> 01:22:35.260
I mean,
everybody knows it should be,
it's just political suicide.

1566
01:22:35.261 --> 01:22:39.420
It fuck about potheads they know the harmless.
They're worried about meth heads.

1567
01:22:39.810 --> 01:22:43.830
Fucking junkies and drunks had two cops worried about the worry about violent

1568
01:22:43.831 --> 01:22:44.140
people.

1569
01:22:44.140 --> 01:22:47.070
Just take somebody to actually do something and I don't think anybody did.

1570
01:22:47.070 --> 01:22:50.210
And nobody's going to commit political suicide this year and,
and,
and,

1571
01:22:50.270 --> 01:22:53.200
and come out.
That's what we need with somebody.
Huge.
The president,

1572
01:22:53.201 --> 01:22:55.650
somebody to said,
but I understand why they can't.
They just can't.

1573
01:22:55.740 --> 01:22:57.690
I don't know what happens when you get an office,

1574
01:22:57.691 --> 01:23:01.980
but clearly someone sits you down and adjust your agenda up before he was in

1575
01:23:01.981 --> 01:23:03.540
office,
you know,
you're sorry.

1576
01:23:03.550 --> 01:23:07.140
Inhaled or you could say it was the point of you doing Obama.
Well,
it's a,

1577
01:23:07.150 --> 01:23:12.100
it's time for weed.
I,
uh,
it's like pauses the tween every word I say.

1578
01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:17.260
So the stupid people can understand me.
Uh,
no.

1579
01:23:17.310 --> 01:23:21.280
Did you?
Oh,
in college sir,
uh,
I did you inhale?

1580
01:23:21.370 --> 01:23:25.360
I took bong rips out of a homemade bomb and I blew them.

1581
01:23:25.420 --> 01:23:27.490
And to everybody on the floors,
math,

1582
01:23:29.100 --> 01:23:30.850
we've got a high supplies at the site.

1583
01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:34.320
He talked about it openly and it,

1584
01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:36.420
when he was campaigner is something they sit you down.

1585
01:23:36.430 --> 01:23:39.070
It's like the men in black thing.
They go something at your agenda,
man.

1586
01:23:39.071 --> 01:23:43.240
Because it's,
it is,
it's,
it's,
it's a head.
It's a,
it's a figure.
You're not,

1587
01:23:43.270 --> 01:23:48.040
you know,
who is pulling the strings then the,
is there a one person,

1588
01:23:48.070 --> 01:23:51.780
is there a committee?
Is there hope?
Is there a society?
Is You fucking,

1589
01:23:51.790 --> 01:23:55.300
if you just read about the Illuminati and listen to Alex Jones,

1590
01:23:55.301 --> 01:23:59.200
you would know who there's gotta be.
There's gotta be one.

1591
01:23:59.210 --> 01:24:02.200
It's got to come all it's got to come down.
It's gotta be,
well,
her group,

1592
01:24:02.201 --> 01:24:05.670
it's definitely,
well,
it's international bankers,
right?
Yeah.

1593
01:24:05.680 --> 01:24:08.050
It's gotta be international because back in even Americans fan and like

1594
01:24:08.051 --> 01:24:10.450
Carnegie's and all of them,
they'd get together and be like,
it's our country,

1595
01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:13.690
dude.
I'm reading this Max Tie Eeb article that's in

1596
01:24:13.900 --> 01:24:17.590
<v 5>Rollingstone.
Dot.
I'm going to stop that shit.
I'll be right back.</v>

1597
01:24:18.770 --> 01:24:19.603
All right.

1598
01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:24.713
Hey.

1599
01:24:24.930 --> 01:24:29.200
<v 4>So then it went away.
Go on.
Let's turn this back.
All right.</v>

1600
01:24:29.870 --> 01:24:34.590
Uh,
so yeah,
I'm getting hungry.

1601
01:24:34.620 --> 01:24:38.800
Too Hungry.
This coconut water is delicious.
You A,

1602
01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:42.510
you actually believe in crazy dream stuff.

1603
01:24:42.750 --> 01:24:46.110
We have talked about this before where he sat me down and was telling his

1604
01:24:46.111 --> 01:24:49.110
theories.
He reads all these books on what kind of dreaming is that called again?

1605
01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:50.640
Dreaming Lucid Jr

1606
01:24:52.220 --> 01:24:57.220
<v 1>I think I have a problem with my,
uh,
in house vacuum cleaner unit.
It's screaming.</v>

1607
01:24:57.760 --> 01:24:58.930
He's letting me know it's dying.

1608
01:24:59.050 --> 01:25:02.360
What were we talking about before I took off because it was interesting.
Um,

1609
01:25:03.450 --> 01:25:06.460
smoking or the people who run the country,
who runs the country,

1610
01:25:06.461 --> 01:25:08.500
who the fuck do you think runs it?
It's not the voters.

1611
01:25:08.590 --> 01:25:10.420
Do you think happens when you get into office?

1612
01:25:10.421 --> 01:25:14.350
Do you think they actually Bill Hicks style sit you down and show you a,

1613
01:25:14.351 --> 01:25:17.080
an angle of the Kennedy assassination and no one's ever seen before?

1614
01:25:17.450 --> 01:25:19.220
If I sit in a room with that,
then what did he say?

1615
01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:23.160
A bunch of smokey industrialists.
Questions.
Yeah.

1616
01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:26.200
What's my agenda?
Doesn't it seem like they're kind of is though?
It's like,

1617
01:25:26.201 --> 01:25:28.990
think about like the skull and bones at,
yeah,
like these real,

1618
01:25:28.991 --> 01:25:32.530
real upper echelon kind of societies that you can never belonged to and you're

1619
01:25:32.531 --> 01:25:34.720
privy to information that nobody,
cause that's,
that's,

1620
01:25:34.750 --> 01:25:36.550
that's the most likely scenario.

1621
01:25:36.550 --> 01:25:40.250
Then it's these elite colleges to keep this group of people in power.
Right.

1622
01:25:40.460 --> 01:25:41.171
I know what she's talking about.

1623
01:25:41.171 --> 01:25:42.820
People that have been in the skull and bones from college,

1624
01:25:42.821 --> 01:25:45.460
I mean it was John Kerry.
It was Bush.
It was,

1625
01:25:45.580 --> 01:25:49.960
there's been a bunch of different people.
They're grown for this from the get go.

1626
01:25:49.961 --> 01:25:53.590
And it's like,
you know,
Obama,
not necessarily net really wasn't,

1627
01:25:53.591 --> 01:25:55.300
but was if you were going to Harvard,

1628
01:25:55.301 --> 01:25:57.010
it's not out of the question to become president,

1629
01:25:57.011 --> 01:25:58.920
but it's a 7% acceptance right there.

1630
01:25:59.390 --> 01:26:02.660
Everybody who becomes president always wanted to be perhaps a lutely.
It didn't,

1631
01:26:02.661 --> 01:26:05.720
it just to you someday.
It's the ultimate political rockstar.

1632
01:26:06.200 --> 01:26:09.380
Even John Kerry was doing,
that's why he went to Vietnam.
I mean,
at least he went,

1633
01:26:09.381 --> 01:26:10.520
but that's why he went,
he's like,

1634
01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:13.270
I'm going to be president and so I can be a hero and get pictures taken.

1635
01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:18.350
Absolutely.
Yeah.
How ruthless is that you're willing to say,

1636
01:26:18.410 --> 01:26:21.980
I am a veteran and I fought for my country.
Right.
Claps and cheers.
Yeah.

1637
01:26:22.100 --> 01:26:25.730
He didn't need to go.
You know what I mean?
Wow.
Yeah.

1638
01:26:25.731 --> 01:26:28.550
He was definitely in college at the time.
His dude's like Bush are like,
oh,

1639
01:26:28.551 --> 01:26:33.080
my back hurts.
I think that smart man,
as I've gotten older,

1640
01:26:33.650 --> 01:26:36.890
my opinion of bushes has changed over and over.
I have changing,

1641
01:26:36.891 --> 01:26:39.650
I used to think that Bush was his fucking monster and this,
this,

1642
01:26:39.651 --> 01:26:43.500
this ignorant piece of shit,
you know,
thrust into this,

1643
01:26:43.510 --> 01:26:46.820
this scenario to kind of lower our standards and make everybody think that

1644
01:26:46.821 --> 01:26:51.440
mediocre is good.
Right.
And you can invent words and it's okay to talk about God.

1645
01:26:51.700 --> 01:26:54.260
And then I realized that this is just a dude with a job.

1646
01:26:55.380 --> 01:27:00.020
I had the relationship with Dick Cheney.
Yeah.
I don't think number one,

1647
01:27:00.021 --> 01:27:03.160
I think he's probably one of the most fun of all presidents you can hang out

1648
01:27:03.170 --> 01:27:06.110
with.
You know,
in my,
my opinion of him changed when that,

1649
01:27:06.140 --> 01:27:08.860
that guy through his shoes at him in Iraq.
Oh yeah.

1650
01:27:08.900 --> 01:27:11.760
That's when I started looking at him when he ducked the shoe and smiled and

1651
01:27:11.770 --> 01:27:13.730
conduct the shoe and smiled.
He's like,
yeah,
I'm like,

1652
01:27:13.731 --> 01:27:17.390
this ain't no ruthless murderer.
Some fucking dude who's just got a job.

1653
01:27:17.420 --> 01:27:20.180
And I never thought that of him in the same thing that bothers me when people

1654
01:27:20.181 --> 01:27:22.550
shit on Obama for saying like,
oh,
he reads a teleprompter.

1655
01:27:22.610 --> 01:27:26.540
You know how many speeches he gives a day that is the dumbest ass and all he's

1656
01:27:26.541 --> 01:27:29.990
got notes and what the fuck he's prepared.
You're upset that he's prepared.

1657
01:27:29.991 --> 01:27:32.850
He wants to do a good job.
And it's the same thing when people say that George W.

1658
01:27:32.850 --> 01:27:36.170
Bush,
it's dumb.
I can promise you this.
He would bury me in a political debate.

1659
01:27:36.410 --> 01:27:40.130
He would no shit.
No,
you wouldn't.
No,
you wouldn't.
Maybe not about policy.

1660
01:27:40.300 --> 01:27:44.690
It's not anything.
Stop it.
I'm smarter than that guy.
Yes,
for sure.

1661
01:27:44.850 --> 01:27:49.100
It was something he was brought in to represent the common folk the same way

1662
01:27:49.340 --> 01:27:51.490
they enabled the,
uh,
the,

1663
01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:54.050
the conservatives to really gain control of this country by embracing the

1664
01:27:54.051 --> 01:27:56.780
Christian right.
When the Reagan administration came in line,

1665
01:27:56.930 --> 01:27:59.540
that was the first time when they really went out of their way to embrace

1666
01:27:59.541 --> 01:28:01.910
religion.
Oh yeah,
go,
go,
go through the Christians.

1667
01:28:02.150 --> 01:28:05.750
The the really zealot [inaudible] was no religious guy.
They never did that,

1668
01:28:05.751 --> 01:28:08.510
but they were very courtly.
But then I realize like,
shit,

1669
01:28:08.540 --> 01:28:09.620
the moonies are doing this.

1670
01:28:09.621 --> 01:28:11.510
All these other motherfuckers are doing this to run the,

1671
01:28:11.511 --> 01:28:13.040
they're making millions of dollars from these morons.

1672
01:28:13.340 --> 01:28:15.570
Let's just tap into this shit and we'll use this.

1673
01:28:15.571 --> 01:28:17.540
This is going to be a big part of our platform.

1674
01:28:17.540 --> 01:28:19.820
This will separate us from everybody else and make us more righteous.

1675
01:28:19.821 --> 01:28:21.860
It's amazing.
It's,
especially with Reagan,
it's like they,

1676
01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:23.840
the Conservatives always talk about too,
it's like,
oh,

1677
01:28:23.841 --> 01:28:25.550
Hollywood liberals and their actors and all that.

1678
01:28:25.551 --> 01:28:28.400
It's like the ones they champion the most are actors.
Ronald Reagan,

1679
01:28:28.610 --> 01:28:29.630
you know Fred Thompson.

1680
01:28:29.631 --> 01:28:33.590
Then it's like so crazy that you would allow a guy who's an expert at lying and

1681
01:28:33.591 --> 01:28:36.650
pretending to be the guy who's supposed to tell you the truth and a divorce.

1682
01:28:37.620 --> 01:28:40.450
That's a chick that's a chicken being guarded by wolves.

1683
01:28:40.451 --> 01:28:42.490
So that's the most ridiculous thing ever you can do.

1684
01:28:42.510 --> 01:28:44.450
Getting the guy who is the best faker ever,

1685
01:28:44.780 --> 01:28:46.340
and he's the one who's going to deliver the truth.

1686
01:28:47.210 --> 01:28:50.810
What a shot at thing recently at the Republican headquarters here,

1687
01:28:50.811 --> 01:28:53.720
and it was amazing to be in there and it's all pictures of Ronald Reagan as far

1688
01:28:53.721 --> 01:28:56.420
as the eyes can see,
which is understandable,
but I'm just like,

1689
01:28:56.750 --> 01:29:00.710
don't you guys remember Bush 41 and Bush 43 they both were presidents to then no

1690
01:29:00.711 --> 01:29:02.970
pictures all they're like,
no,
no,
no.
Brian,
Brian,

1691
01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:08.000
go on youtube and find Ronald Reagan speech where he talks about aliens.

1692
01:29:09.570 --> 01:29:10.380
Have you ever been to that,
Ron?

1693
01:29:10.380 --> 01:29:15.380
Each that is one of the trippiest speeches of president has ever given to two

1694
01:29:17.670 --> 01:29:22.050
people talking about that.
The intergalactic talked about if we quit,

1695
01:29:22.051 --> 01:29:25.710
how quickly we would abandon all of our troubles with each other if we were

1696
01:29:25.711 --> 01:29:28.380
being attacked by aliens from another planet.
Oh Wow.

1697
01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:33.930
I mean he was making a point clearly that,
you know,

1698
01:29:34.050 --> 01:29:38.340
we would be United as one conventionally group for sure.
We were.

1699
01:29:38.341 --> 01:29:41.640
You think we'd go after each other?
No we would not.
We would not.
If there was,

1700
01:29:41.641 --> 01:29:45.210
if there was aliens.
The only problem is if the aliens got to like,
you know,

1701
01:29:45.360 --> 01:29:49.430
some Douche bags,
I don't want to mention any names,
some douchebag countries.

1702
01:29:49.610 --> 01:29:50.850
I'm like,
listen,
just come with us.

1703
01:29:50.851 --> 01:29:54.240
We'll give you fucking flying saucers to sell out these other cons right now.

1704
01:29:54.260 --> 01:29:57.180
And then they'd go over and say,
listen,
we've made peace with the aliens,

1705
01:29:57.181 --> 01:29:59.100
the aliens are friends.
We just come over here,

1706
01:29:59.101 --> 01:30:01.140
we'll show you where they are and boom,
you're in a cage.

1707
01:30:01.490 --> 01:30:04.170
They're definitely hostile.
It their common maybe.
Well we,

1708
01:30:04.180 --> 01:30:08.550
we are where we're hustled to everything and like we talked about the east coast

1709
01:30:08.551 --> 01:30:11.410
and west coast and survival than it is.
And you know,
just the,

1710
01:30:11.411 --> 01:30:13.620
the what the massive changes happen in this country.

1711
01:30:13.621 --> 01:30:17.160
It's all been because of negative shit and all this massive change.

1712
01:30:17.161 --> 01:30:20.400
A lot of it is because of negativity.
He likes something in our lifetime,

1713
01:30:20.401 --> 01:30:21.031
it's going to happen.

1714
01:30:21.031 --> 01:30:24.390
Like big foot's going to get found like something cool like that.

1715
01:30:25.430 --> 01:30:28.650
Some legend is going to get expelled or some legends going to get proven true.

1716
01:30:28.710 --> 01:30:30.030
Well,
you know,
there's,
there's the,

1717
01:30:30.120 --> 01:30:33.120
the craziest theory about your life is that your life,

1718
01:30:33.150 --> 01:30:34.680
really what it actually is,

1719
01:30:34.681 --> 01:30:38.280
is as the world gets crazier and as you know,

1720
01:30:38.281 --> 01:30:42.060
more chaos ensues and you worry about extinction,
you worry about,
you know,

1721
01:30:42.061 --> 01:30:44.490
some sort of a cataclysmic disaster that wipes out the race.

1722
01:30:44.760 --> 01:30:49.560
What you're really realizing is that you're dying and that your own world,

1723
01:30:49.561 --> 01:30:53.190
this universe that you have created is slowly starting to fall apart at the

1724
01:30:53.191 --> 01:30:55.620
seams because your life is starting to end.

1725
01:30:55.980 --> 01:31:00.360
And this whole life of history and space,

1726
01:31:00.361 --> 01:31:03.360
it's all an illusion and it's all something that's been created by your

1727
01:31:03.361 --> 01:31:05.610
imagination as it plays out,

1728
01:31:05.850 --> 01:31:09.810
as it becomes more and more ridiculous and catastrophic and,
and,
and,

1729
01:31:09.840 --> 01:31:12.900
and as it ends that says your life ends.
Wow,

1730
01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:14.820
that's an interesting point to think of it that way.

1731
01:31:15.990 --> 01:31:20.970
Just as possible as you are one being and there's a billion other beings and

1732
01:31:20.971 --> 01:31:25.200
they're all in this one rock and all in this one galaxy.
And I mean that's,

1733
01:31:25.230 --> 01:31:29.160
that's crazy as it sounds in and of itself,
it's all crazy.
It makes sense.

1734
01:31:29.161 --> 01:31:31.380
And it makes you just realize sometimes too,
it's just a silly nice,

1735
01:31:31.381 --> 01:31:34.020
like sometimes you almost just want to sit down and just laugh at the silly shit

1736
01:31:34.021 --> 01:31:37.020
that we do.
Spend a fair,
oh my God,
look at why do I care?

1737
01:31:37.230 --> 01:31:40.800
Like I can detach myself from something really quickly through that,
you know?

1738
01:31:40.800 --> 01:31:42.510
And that's what kind of like Buddhism is always about.

1739
01:31:42.511 --> 01:31:45.090
Like just detaching from it,
not giving a shit.
You know what I mean?

1740
01:31:45.091 --> 01:31:49.440
It's like if it doesn't affect you,
like death does not scare me.
It's like,
man,

1741
01:31:49.500 --> 01:31:54.330
it's going to come.
Just suffering.
Fucking sucks.
Suffering socks,
being injured,

1742
01:31:54.331 --> 01:31:58.110
socks being,
you know,
being in pain socks.
But yeah,
death is like sleep,
right?

1743
01:31:58.120 --> 01:32:01.810
Losing someone.
Socks,
socks.

1744
01:32:02.110 --> 01:32:04.390
But it's like everybody's biggest fear is death and it's like,

1745
01:32:04.391 --> 01:32:07.330
if it ain't going to end,
even if it is your biggest fear and it happens,

1746
01:32:07.331 --> 01:32:08.550
then what happens?

1747
01:32:08.740 --> 01:32:11.200
I always talk about how one of the trickiest things in this life is that

1748
01:32:11.201 --> 01:32:14.630
everyone likes to sleep,
but no one wants to die.
No,
no,
no.
When you're sleeping,

1749
01:32:14.720 --> 01:32:17.770
you're looking forward to going away.
You're looking forward to shutting off,

1750
01:32:18.020 --> 01:32:18.640
right.

1751
01:32:18.640 --> 01:32:22.540
It looking forward to the relief that you get from turning your body off and

1752
01:32:22.541 --> 01:32:26.570
recovering.
Right.
That's some pretty crazy shit,
man.
Yeah,
dude,
I,
I,

1753
01:32:27.040 --> 01:32:30.960
it's the same kind of effect that the DMT is released during dream state that

1754
01:32:30.970 --> 01:32:33.340
that supposedly,
right.
It's all anecdotal evidence,

1755
01:32:33.341 --> 01:32:34.630
but that's what they believe happens.

1756
01:32:34.810 --> 01:32:39.160
But all I know is I don't give a fuck about,
I love it.
I love going asleep.
Oh,

1757
01:32:39.161 --> 01:32:39.641
here we go.

1758
01:32:39.641 --> 01:32:42.590
I don't think about the fact that I'm going to disappear for eight hours and you

1759
01:32:42.591 --> 01:32:45.130
just kind of trusted the world doesn't fall apart at the seams.

1760
01:32:45.450 --> 01:32:49.210
Billowed while I'm unconscious,
be cool to be able to hybrid a dude.

1761
01:32:49.240 --> 01:32:50.800
Bears don't really hibernate,
you know,

1762
01:32:50.810 --> 01:32:55.270
that semi-conscious full kind of just relaxation.
They just don't do much.

1763
01:32:55.330 --> 01:32:57.400
They just kind of like a fuck,
this sucks.
Yeah.

1764
01:32:57.401 --> 01:33:00.160
I guess you could still get up and fuck you up.
Yeah.

1765
01:33:00.161 --> 01:33:03.400
Cause there are bear attacks and the winter aren't crazy.
Yeah.
You Go,

1766
01:33:03.401 --> 01:33:06.040
the real scary thing about the bear attacks in the winter is there a lot.

1767
01:33:06.041 --> 01:33:09.280
Most of the time it's bears trying to eat you because they're starving to death.

1768
01:33:09.640 --> 01:33:10.960
That's how grizzly man died.

1769
01:33:11.290 --> 01:33:14.510
That crazy ass holders was living up in Alaska with doubles bears.
Yeah.

1770
01:33:14.530 --> 01:33:17.080
You heard the tape.
Have you seen the bit,
I haven't heard the tape.

1771
01:33:17.081 --> 01:33:19.730
The death tape.
There's a death Tapout.
Isn't there a death?

1772
01:33:21.460 --> 01:33:24.340
There's not one yet wanted to get it,
but it was when it was,

1773
01:33:24.341 --> 01:33:29.260
as the camera was running,
I was only audio and a Werner Herzog.

1774
01:33:29.290 --> 01:33:32.080
The director listens to it on camera.
You see him listening to,

1775
01:33:32.081 --> 01:33:33.630
that's what they should.
They didn't show that.

1776
01:33:33.640 --> 01:33:36.130
They don't actually play it at all.

1777
01:33:36.430 --> 01:33:41.240
It was like six minutes long,
man.
They,
they shut that guy on that.

1778
01:33:41.260 --> 01:33:45.370
I survived who got basically eaten and mauled by a bear and survived and the

1779
01:33:45.371 --> 01:33:50.200
bear was shitting on him peeing on him,
like treating him like his kill.

1780
01:33:50.200 --> 01:33:54.180
It was so nasty.
That's so scary.
It is.
How did he get out of that?

1781
01:33:54.181 --> 01:33:57.220
There was a threat to Ronald Reagan Shit.

1782
01:33:58.080 --> 01:34:02.140
This world where you wanted from the beginning of their species,
we wind it,

1783
01:34:02.141 --> 01:34:02.860
Brian.

1784
01:34:02.860 --> 01:34:07.660
Suddenly there was a threat to this world from some other species,

1785
01:34:08.230 --> 01:34:12.280
from another planet outside in the universe.

1786
01:34:12.940 --> 01:34:17.470
We'd forget all the little local differences that we have between our countries,

1787
01:34:17.500 --> 01:34:18.640
the United Nations.

1788
01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:24.000
Perhaps we need some outside universal threat to make us recognize this common

1789
01:34:24.581 --> 01:34:25.414
bound.

1790
01:34:26.140 --> 01:34:31.140
I occasionally think how quickly our differences worldwide would vanish if we

1791
01:34:33.011 --> 01:34:36.760
were facing an alien threat from outside this world.

1792
01:34:37.900 --> 01:34:38.560
Wow.

1793
01:34:38.560 --> 01:34:42.910
So true spaces filled with warriors just flying to other countries,

1794
01:34:42.940 --> 01:34:43.840
jacking people.

1795
01:34:43.990 --> 01:34:48.270
I'd like to think that we galvanize an ante up and I'll get together like in

1796
01:34:48.280 --> 01:34:52.150
science.
Do you think so?
Do you think,
well,
I think we would to attack the aliens,

1797
01:34:52.151 --> 01:34:55.450
but do you think that any species ever gets to a point where it doesn't fuck

1798
01:34:55.451 --> 01:34:59.780
with the weaker species?
It's hard.
Think that a mass collectiveness of,
of,

1799
01:34:59.930 --> 01:35:03.800
of a fight or flight.
What would happen?
I think most put fly.

1800
01:35:04.250 --> 01:35:08.000
Most people would just go hide and be scared.
No,
no,
no,
no.
What I'm saying is,

1801
01:35:08.001 --> 01:35:12.200
do you think that alien life in all,
all galaxies and all whatever,

1802
01:35:12.201 --> 01:35:14.810
wherever exists,
wherever it exists,
intelligent life,

1803
01:35:14.811 --> 01:35:16.970
do you think it always fucks with whatever's weaker than it?

1804
01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:20.420
Does that just help things become strong?
Yeah,
I think so.
I think that's nature,

1805
01:35:20.421 --> 01:35:23.810
right?
That's just dominant survival.
Or the candidate have to fuck with us.

1806
01:35:24.050 --> 01:35:25.100
They would have to fuck with us.

1807
01:35:25.101 --> 01:35:27.770
Now the thing I don't quite understand is why everybody gives them credit for

1808
01:35:27.771 --> 01:35:30.970
being so smart if they came here,
you know,
because they can get,

1809
01:35:30.971 --> 01:35:35.390
they can get here.
But what if we can get to where they're at?
Um,
well we can't,

1810
01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:39.120
we're getting closer.
We're getting closer but more water on the moon.
But,

1811
01:35:39.121 --> 01:35:41.180
but yeah,
they found water.
No more water.
Yeah,

1812
01:35:41.380 --> 01:35:43.080
a lot more than they thought that they,

1813
01:35:43.090 --> 01:35:46.520
there's also the idea that they could use that as like the moon is a refueling

1814
01:35:46.521 --> 01:35:48.050
station or something up there.

1815
01:35:48.051 --> 01:35:50.960
And they use that like as a launch because it's 260,000 miles out and it doesn't

1816
01:35:50.961 --> 01:35:54.110
have the same kind of gravity.
So they could start launching shit from the moon.

1817
01:35:54.111 --> 01:35:54.741
But you know,

1818
01:35:54.741 --> 01:35:57.800
you have to prove to me that you can survive in deep space for a long period of

1819
01:35:57.801 --> 01:36:00.590
time that people are going to willing to take,
be willing to take that chance.

1820
01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:04.580
Yeah.
There's like the,
the,
the Mars project and there's another thing that they,

1821
01:36:04.581 --> 01:36:08.480
uh,
they've been concentrating on this uh,
this idea of a hundred year spaceship,

1822
01:36:08.690 --> 01:36:12.230
a spaceship that can exist,
you know,
has enough fuel to run a hundred years.

1823
01:36:12.470 --> 01:36:14.660
Oh yeah.
And survive to colonize galaxy.

1824
01:36:14.690 --> 01:36:17.720
That's like a project that's currently in development.
That kind of stuff.

1825
01:36:17.750 --> 01:36:21.020
Like you know,
fuck man,
that's some,
that's some deep shit.

1826
01:36:21.021 --> 01:36:25.880
Like if they really at a hundred years
that's possible.

1827
01:36:26.120 --> 01:36:26.751
But that would suck.

1828
01:36:26.751 --> 01:36:29.770
Like being on a hundred year spaceship and then like a couple of years are
there,

1829
01:36:29.800 --> 01:36:31.810
they made like the 200 year spaceship and back,
man,

1830
01:36:31.811 --> 01:36:34.670
I want to be on the 200 year spaceship so my kids could live longer too.

1831
01:36:34.730 --> 01:36:35.810
Or You have a change in thought.

1832
01:36:35.811 --> 01:36:38.420
I think you have a hundred years to get somewhere and if you can't get there in

1833
01:36:38.421 --> 01:36:41.750
a hundred years,
you're fucked.
But the thing is how do they keep enough food?

1834
01:36:41.780 --> 01:36:45.740
How big is this goddamn spaceship?
Are they growing their own food?
Like yeah,

1835
01:36:45.741 --> 01:36:48.830
you'd have to do something like to grow your own food and what kind of power

1836
01:36:48.831 --> 01:36:51.560
would you be able to use nuclear power to use nuclear power?

1837
01:36:51.630 --> 01:36:52.510
How the fuck else could you?

1838
01:36:52.530 --> 01:36:55.520
What if everybody got radiation sickness and shit or you just blow the time he

1839
01:36:55.521 --> 01:36:55.850
got there?

1840
01:36:55.850 --> 01:37:00.260
Were you communicating with Shit and three I'd motherfuckers would six arms and

1841
01:37:00.261 --> 01:37:00.600
shit.

1842
01:37:00.600 --> 01:37:03.770
Everybody was a mutant from other radiation because they'd never done long term

1843
01:37:03.771 --> 01:37:06.200
exposure studies.
They had a trip.
We'd have to take a chance.

1844
01:37:06.290 --> 01:37:07.880
I'd sign up for that shit with you.

1845
01:37:08.390 --> 01:37:09.980
I always think when people think that maybe this,

1846
01:37:09.981 --> 01:37:12.980
if this is the last generation or if the Mayan calendar posture or something

1847
01:37:12.981 --> 01:37:13.221
like that,

1848
01:37:13.221 --> 01:37:16.850
I feel pretty damn honored to be on the last part of the last generation again,

1849
01:37:16.851 --> 01:37:20.090
that could just be the end of your life,
man.
Yeah,
exactly.
I manufactured.

1850
01:37:20.140 --> 01:37:22.940
So does that mean that you're a character in my life?
Seems like it.

1851
01:37:23.300 --> 01:37:26.720
Through your eyes.
I'm an actor.
Am I in yours?
Well,
maybe we're all both.

1852
01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:30.770
Maybe it's both.
Maybe.
Maybe there is no tangibility to life.

1853
01:37:30.771 --> 01:37:33.590
Maybe it's [inaudible].
Maybe it exists in both ways.

1854
01:37:33.680 --> 01:37:36.830
Maybe you're just a part of my imagination and I'm a part of yours.

1855
01:37:37.130 --> 01:37:40.040
Like that'd be crazy if you made up all this,
the earth,
the atmosphere,

1856
01:37:40.041 --> 01:37:41.040
you made it all the,

1857
01:37:41.041 --> 01:37:44.450
you made it up that it almost exists as a part of your program.

1858
01:37:44.480 --> 01:37:46.370
That's what we were talking about earlier.
Lucid dreaming.

1859
01:37:46.371 --> 01:37:48.140
Like the ability to wake up during your dreams.

1860
01:37:48.740 --> 01:37:51.830
Yon and I can't say I do it often.
It's hard.

1861
01:37:51.920 --> 01:37:54.140
I've only done it once or twice by accident.

1862
01:37:54.141 --> 01:37:56.070
And because I saw a movie where a guy

1863
01:37:56.070 --> 01:38:00.060
<v 3>had a technique where in real life,
every time we'd walk through a door,</v>

1864
01:38:00.061 --> 01:38:03.570
he would Charla the door.
He would knock on the door and go,
am I dreaming?
Yeah,

1865
01:38:03.600 --> 01:38:07.390
that's the,
that's the trick that during I did once in a dream that Steven,

1866
01:38:07.410 --> 01:38:09.000
Dr Steven Lind purge is the one,

1867
01:38:09.001 --> 01:38:11.250
I'd read all these books about it quite by accident one day,

1868
01:38:11.251 --> 01:38:14.340
but I started reading it was fascinating because he did it at Stanford and

1869
01:38:14.341 --> 01:38:17.220
taught all these kids to do it to the point where they were so good at it.

1870
01:38:17.221 --> 01:38:19.710
They were developing skills in their dreams.
They could do it at will.

1871
01:38:19.711 --> 01:38:21.270
It's basically like laying down in bed and saying,

1872
01:38:21.271 --> 01:38:22.750
here's what I'm going to dream about tonight.
Right?

1873
01:38:22.830 --> 01:38:25.470
It's like a meditation practice.
You can end,
you can do it two ways.

1874
01:38:25.471 --> 01:38:28.650
You can wake herself up in a dream or you can just enter it straight in and that

1875
01:38:28.651 --> 01:38:33.600
takes extreme concentration,
like focus,
focus,
focus.
But um,
you know,
in it,

1876
01:38:33.601 --> 01:38:37.170
it's like you start to realize how fascinating your brain is cause you'll

1877
01:38:37.440 --> 01:38:41.400
completely reproduce something to a t like you.
Like I fucking made that.

1878
01:38:41.430 --> 01:38:43.500
That's my thought.
I'm white.
How many times have you done this?

1879
01:38:43.501 --> 01:38:46.620
I've done it probably like five times in my life.
It's hard in.

1880
01:38:46.621 --> 01:38:49.800
The problem is it's like if you smoke pot,
you don't get true rem sleep.

1881
01:38:49.801 --> 01:38:52.440
Like a lot of people like you know,
you don't seem to,

1882
01:38:52.441 --> 01:38:55.830
you don't have potheads don't seem to remember dreams as well.

1883
01:38:55.831 --> 01:38:59.280
Some are different.
Maybe it's a different kind of your smoking.
It's that true.

1884
01:38:59.310 --> 01:39:02.610
If you inhibit your,
your your brain at all with alcohol,
anything,

1885
01:39:02.611 --> 01:39:06.170
you're going to have a harder time.
Dreaming stops me from dreaming.
Google that.

1886
01:39:06.180 --> 01:39:10.320
See I don't kill a dreamer but I don't know.
But I,
I know that the Times I've,

1887
01:39:10.380 --> 01:39:12.150
the best time that happened they say is in the morning.

1888
01:39:12.150 --> 01:39:15.790
Wake yourself up like at six in the morning and go back to sleep like Thomas.

1889
01:39:16.140 --> 01:39:19.860
That's when you can get them for the novice.
They say,
and I've only had a few,

1890
01:39:19.861 --> 01:39:24.300
but they're amazing.
It's like you manufactured this world.
You can fly this.

1891
01:39:24.301 --> 01:39:26.030
The thing that you,
you tend to do,
which I did.

1892
01:39:26.040 --> 01:39:29.190
You come around punching people because you can't,
it's just amazing.

1893
01:39:29.191 --> 01:39:32.760
But your brain says real as you and I are right now.
And if you just,

1894
01:39:32.790 --> 01:39:36.240
there was focus and techniques thing like you can use on youtube and stuff.

1895
01:39:36.241 --> 01:39:38.400
They'll see,
they'll show you how to do it.
But what I should explain,

1896
01:39:38.401 --> 01:39:41.460
what I was talking about before,
just the knock on the door.
I said,

1897
01:39:41.461 --> 01:39:44.240
knock on a door in real life,
when you're walking through your house,

1898
01:39:44.260 --> 01:39:46.320
knock on the door and go,
am I dreaming?
Right.

1899
01:39:46.350 --> 01:39:48.660
And then obviously you walked through it.
You're not training,

1900
01:39:48.960 --> 01:39:52.200
but you feel the knock.
And that's what a dot.
How you know you're not dreaming.

1901
01:39:52.230 --> 01:39:56.790
Right?
Well,
I did this for a couple of days and then I was in a dream and I went,

1902
01:39:57.150 --> 01:39:59.580
am I dreaming all my God,
I'm dreaming,
right?

1903
01:39:59.730 --> 01:40:02.310
My hand just went right through the door,
right?
And I was like,
whoa.

1904
01:40:02.311 --> 01:40:05.610
And so then I opened up the door and the door was like the edge of a cliff and

1905
01:40:05.611 --> 01:40:08.960
there was like clouds and shit and I just started flying.
Wow,
isn't this a shit?

1906
01:40:09.030 --> 01:40:10.000
The dope is fucking,

1907
01:40:10.100 --> 01:40:13.770
if you could on tested for like 30 seconds and a cause I was going,
oh shit,

1908
01:40:13.771 --> 01:40:17.430
I can't believe I'm drawing a flying.
How am I doing?
I'm w awake.
They,

1909
01:40:17.440 --> 01:40:20.490
they say they say that that's what happens the first time is you're so

1910
01:40:20.491 --> 01:40:24.720
overwhelmed by it.
You're like shot my love and my pants,
my pants off.

1911
01:40:24.720 --> 01:40:28.200
I shot my load.
That's what happened.
I was like,
well really going to have sex.

1912
01:40:28.650 --> 01:40:33.080
Oh fuck.
But it's like if you practice it enough,
it's just like meditation.

1913
01:40:33.090 --> 01:40:34.200
You can get good at it apparently.

1914
01:40:34.201 --> 01:40:36.690
I just forget the practice it cause I just crash half the time.

1915
01:40:36.780 --> 01:40:40.020
Well you know you asked me about the isolation tank you got to look into.

1916
01:40:40.050 --> 01:40:43.890
I'll talk all day because the isolation tank is lucid dreaming and 10 minutes

1917
01:40:43.920 --> 01:40:48.000
guaranteed guaranteed every time you're going to go somewhere.
Oh that's awesome.

1918
01:40:48.001 --> 01:40:49.920
And the more you,
the more you relax,

1919
01:40:49.921 --> 01:40:51.780
the more you get good at it and the more you get good at it,

1920
01:40:51.781 --> 01:40:53.980
the deeper you can go and do your things.
Get,
my dad

1921
01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:56.320
<v 1>always told me about it as a kid.
He did it a lot in the air force.</v>

1922
01:40:56.370 --> 01:40:59.010
What do you love about what part of La?
Uh,
have now?

1923
01:41:01.730 --> 01:41:05.920
You didn't have say this is a place in Burbank,
it's called soothing solutions.

1924
01:41:05.950 --> 01:41:07.080
It's really good.
And uh,

1925
01:41:07.330 --> 01:41:11.170
they have these tanks and your rent them by the hour and you get totally worth

1926
01:41:11.171 --> 01:41:12.550
it man.
So it's try it,

1927
01:41:12.580 --> 01:41:15.600
it's the same temperature as your body so you can't feel your body right.

1928
01:41:15.640 --> 01:41:16.570
You don't feel your body,

1929
01:41:16.690 --> 01:41:21.370
you just feel the water when you get into it in the water is filled with 800

1930
01:41:21.371 --> 01:41:24.930
pounds of salt.
So you float.
Alright.
And then once you relax you,

1931
01:41:24.960 --> 01:41:26.890
you're floating in that water and you don't hear anything.

1932
01:41:26.891 --> 01:41:28.690
You don't see anything.
You have no sensory input.

1933
01:41:28.810 --> 01:41:31.450
There's another place in Venice called the float lab.
That's awesome.

1934
01:41:31.930 --> 01:41:35.140
He's the guy who built my,
my latest tank.
He's the,
the state of the art guy.

1935
01:41:35.141 --> 01:41:37.630
If you go a full lab.com he's going to call his lab.

1936
01:41:37.720 --> 01:41:40.210
Like he's got all of his tanks and the design,

1937
01:41:40.211 --> 01:41:43.030
like it's all stainless steel and shit.
His stuff is like real high tech,

1938
01:41:43.031 --> 01:41:44.260
like top of the line.

1939
01:41:44.261 --> 01:41:47.740
So while it's basically the same amount of money as the other tanks on the

1940
01:41:47.741 --> 01:41:51.760
market,
he charges the same amount but there was fucking infinitely superior.

1941
01:41:52.090 --> 01:41:55.170
How long can you stay in now?
It's like go in there for hours.
Really?
Howard's,

1942
01:41:55.171 --> 01:41:58.900
yeah,
it's just like extreme meditation,
space travel,
Dude.

1943
01:41:58.901 --> 01:42:01.210
I was spaceship and the things that I've seen,

1944
01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:03.670
the shit that I see on a regular basis in there,

1945
01:42:04.030 --> 01:42:06.680
most people don't ever experience it their whole life and I experienced it

1946
01:42:06.710 --> 01:42:09.730
several times a week,
which,
which the cool thing is because the body,

1947
01:42:09.731 --> 01:42:12.640
if you're not physically there,
it's still a real experience.

1948
01:42:12.700 --> 01:42:14.170
You know what I mean?
It's still you still,

1949
01:42:14.171 --> 01:42:17.680
your mind is still learning experience.
Yes.
If it were real,

1950
01:42:18.090 --> 01:42:21.970
because you're untethered from your body,
so your body and you're,

1951
01:42:21.971 --> 01:42:23.470
you don't get any input from your body.

1952
01:42:23.471 --> 01:42:28.300
So your mind is free to just explore any ideas and and manifest and visualize

1953
01:42:28.301 --> 01:42:32.430
these ideas.
You know your imagination when it's not harness or,

1954
01:42:32.440 --> 01:42:35.260
or not like being controlled by the body,
you know,

1955
01:42:35.261 --> 01:42:38.790
were being hampered down by the body.
Your imagination like creates a world.

1956
01:42:38.840 --> 01:42:39.611
Oh yeah.
You know,

1957
01:42:39.611 --> 01:42:44.611
we don't fucking know exactly what thinking and imagination truly is and we've

1958
01:42:44.681 --> 01:42:49.120
not tapped his imagination.
The ability to create in your mind,

1959
01:42:49.360 --> 01:42:49.931
I mean that,

1960
01:42:49.931 --> 01:42:54.400
that seems to me to be some sort of a driving force in the universe.

1961
01:42:54.640 --> 01:42:58.660
If you look at what the idea of imagination,
the idea of creation,

1962
01:42:58.661 --> 01:43:02.470
it manifests itself in a bunch of different things and manifests itself in art

1963
01:43:02.620 --> 01:43:06.160
and it manifests itself in inventions and it manifests and manifest is things

1964
01:43:06.161 --> 01:43:09.430
that improve your life and keep people healthy and keep people alive.

1965
01:43:09.610 --> 01:43:13.540
Keep people alive longer so they figure things out more so they come up with

1966
01:43:13.541 --> 01:43:15.880
better ideas.
These are all products of the imagination.

1967
01:43:15.881 --> 01:43:20.350
Everything from science to vitamins.
These are products of someone went,

1968
01:43:20.560 --> 01:43:23.140
I think I can get that shit out of there and put it in a pill.

1969
01:43:23.370 --> 01:43:24.203
It's the imagination.

1970
01:43:24.220 --> 01:43:26.830
That's the mind trying to be curious and figure this shit out.

1971
01:43:26.980 --> 01:43:30.700
I mean it's like a driving force of the universe and it's kind of a cut like an

1972
01:43:30.701 --> 01:43:32.470
all a ubiquitous horse too.

1973
01:43:32.471 --> 01:43:36.020
Cause it's like sometimes inventions are being thought of at the same time.
Yeah,

1974
01:43:36.070 --> 01:43:38.120
sure.
Like the Wright brothers,
you know they were working on a thing,

1975
01:43:38.121 --> 01:43:40.750
but there was that guy over in England who had his thing he was working on and

1976
01:43:40.751 --> 01:43:43.330
they were racing each other.
I mean flight was inevitable.

1977
01:43:43.331 --> 01:43:45.400
You knew it was curling.
Perfect example.

1978
01:43:45.670 --> 01:43:49.780
Ozu would you saying earlier that cell phones,
if you had them in the past,

1979
01:43:49.781 --> 01:43:53.810
people would think of like you were a,
I said that so many times.
Perfect example,

1980
01:43:53.960 --> 01:43:56.250
but it's two people looking something.
Both of them are gone.
What was it?

1981
01:43:56.251 --> 01:43:59.810
If work is going on here and then they both people come to some sort of a same

1982
01:43:59.811 --> 01:44:01.670
conclusion when they figured out radio is the same thing.

1983
01:44:01.671 --> 01:44:04.670
There's a bunch of people that figured out the radio.
It was Marconi.
It was,

1984
01:44:04.680 --> 01:44:08.480
there's a bunch of different guys that were working on the the same situation

1985
01:44:08.660 --> 01:44:11.000
and then every now and then you get a guy like Nikola Tesla.

1986
01:44:11.030 --> 01:44:12.980
That's so fucking far out there.

1987
01:44:12.981 --> 01:44:16.320
No one thought of any of the shit that he came up with.
And you,

1988
01:44:16.321 --> 01:44:20.110
you look at his stuff,
you're like,
well,
what the fuck is this dude on dementia?

1989
01:44:20.120 --> 01:44:21.530
What?
They had dementia at the Getty.

1990
01:44:21.531 --> 01:44:24.200
I went and looked at his scribblings just like,
he literally like thick,

1991
01:44:24.360 --> 01:44:28.640
you know the helicopter,
all that shit.
Like the guy,
the guy was so bloody genius,

1992
01:44:28.641 --> 01:44:30.350
brilliant.
Like his sketches were just like,

1993
01:44:30.440 --> 01:44:32.960
I cannot believe somebody was thinking this advanced dude.

1994
01:44:32.961 --> 01:44:37.610
He wasn't even like the 14 hundreds somebody made a threat about it on the Rogan

1995
01:44:37.611 --> 01:44:39.570
board saying,
what was it?

1996
01:44:39.770 --> 01:44:43.910
Could you imagine this is the guy said if you lived in a world where everyone

1997
01:44:43.911 --> 01:44:45.950
else had down syndrome,
and he was like,

1998
01:44:45.951 --> 01:44:50.390
that's what it must have been like to be divinci Baxter in the 14 hundreds

1999
01:44:50.391 --> 01:44:55.391
creating helicopters and all these machines bisecting the human body diagramming

2000
01:44:55.881 --> 01:45:00.270
it to a t and your neighbors.
Just some retarders like what say you sir?
Yeah,

2001
01:45:00.350 --> 01:45:02.210
he's fucking his sheep.
And he probably,

2002
01:45:02.211 --> 01:45:04.760
and he's probably one of those guys like I can't believe it's a fucking 14

2003
01:45:04.761 --> 01:45:08.270
hundreds.
I can't wait.
I'm not going to be probably a time traveler.
Yeah,

2004
01:45:08.271 --> 01:45:10.490
big time dude.
I think there are times,

2005
01:45:10.860 --> 01:45:14.240
I think there is going to be time traveling.
Good.
We can do that shit.

2006
01:45:14.690 --> 01:45:17.810
There will be but there hasn't been.
There hasn't been.

2007
01:45:18.050 --> 01:45:21.080
And then when it does happen it's like I said it's gonna make everything Nolan

2008
01:45:21.081 --> 01:45:24.070
boy got to break the whole package.
Did you know they filmed uh,

2009
01:45:24.110 --> 01:45:24.861
back to the future?

2010
01:45:24.861 --> 01:45:28.850
They filmed like half the movie with Eric Stoltz as the role of Marty and then

2011
01:45:29.130 --> 01:45:32.800
Mike,
they just weren't feeling it and he'd had to go bust stop.

2012
01:45:32.801 --> 01:45:36.260
And we filmed the whole movie from the start.
There are a month,
Michael J,
Fox,

2013
01:45:36.440 --> 01:45:39.980
Michael J for a month then with salts and they just released recently cause they

2014
01:45:39.981 --> 01:45:42.140
just came out on DVD.
The DVD set.

2015
01:45:42.141 --> 01:45:44.640
I've seen it before cause I remember saying to Eric Stoltz footage and just
like,

2016
01:45:44.660 --> 01:45:48.470
it just,
that ain't right.
It's not right.
It's just not good.
Rocky.

2017
01:45:48.471 --> 01:45:49.890
Dennis has my back to the future.

2018
01:45:51.920 --> 01:45:55.040
Eric Stoltz is probably where it all fell apart for him.
And you know what?

2019
01:45:55.041 --> 01:45:56.330
That's a,
that's the thing.
It's like what do you do?

2020
01:45:56.331 --> 01:45:58.850
Have to get some kind of wonderful than bit parts here and there.

2021
01:45:58.851 --> 01:46:02.390
And fiction was the best pulp fiction.
This is as it was the apex of his career.

2022
01:46:02.480 --> 01:46:07.190
Was He in killings?
Zoe?
Yes.
That's one of my favorite movies.
That's a good God.

2023
01:46:07.670 --> 01:46:11.540
Nikita too.
There's guys like him like Matt Modine.

2024
01:46:11.541 --> 01:46:14.510
Like what happened in those guys?
Like Matt Modine?
Yeah.
Matthew Modine.

2025
01:46:14.970 --> 01:46:18.660
Imagine quest.
Yeah,
that guy was off in quest is a great God damn movie.

2026
01:46:19.040 --> 01:46:22.140
He's going to wrestle for state.
He's,
he's got the,
the,

2027
01:46:22.141 --> 01:46:25.490
the heat suit on that or a band now.
It's a good fucking mood.

2028
01:46:25.510 --> 01:46:28.670
That's was a good fucking luck.
Matt Modine and the hot chick.

2029
01:46:28.671 --> 01:46:31.130
What the fuck was her name and that movie?
Oh God.
Damn.

2030
01:46:31.131 --> 01:46:33.840
That pitch was pretty conscious.
What is her name?
Um,

2031
01:46:34.070 --> 01:46:38.720
who is envisioned quest [inaudible] it's not Diane Lane,
was it?
No,

2032
01:46:38.721 --> 01:46:42.560
I don't think it was Diane Lane.
Look it up.
You need,
can you,
uh,
I am DB.

2033
01:46:42.561 --> 01:46:45.920
It should be a vision quest.
Like they see,
this is the beauty of the Internet.

2034
01:46:46.360 --> 01:46:49.230
This is everything Brian cast.

2035
01:46:50.230 --> 01:46:53.420
<v 3>He writes asshole in everything.
Every question.</v>

2036
01:46:54.330 --> 01:46:56.760
Every time he does an internet search,
he'll,

2037
01:46:56.761 --> 01:47:01.761
he'll add finger butthole just to live at the photos on my is an asshole.

2038
01:47:04.890 --> 01:47:06.630
Who is the chick?
I'm still

2039
01:47:09.400 --> 01:47:13.140
a Linda Fluorine Tino.
Damn.
Nobody heard of her anymore.

2040
01:47:14.340 --> 01:47:18.390
She was hot as fuck dimension.
Remember how pretty she was?

2041
01:47:18.391 --> 01:47:19.770
She was [inaudible].

2042
01:47:20.820 --> 01:47:24.270
Maybe Kate's the fast times the dues in the bathroom fan.

2043
01:47:25.110 --> 01:47:26.810
And she walked in and caught them.
Was Dick in his hand?

2044
01:47:26.830 --> 01:47:30.190
She just kind of went away too.
Yeah.
Well she got pregnant.
I think that had some,

2045
01:47:30.191 --> 01:47:32.970
she's married to a,
the actor.
I'm

2046
01:47:34.810 --> 01:47:37.530
Greg Kinnear,
but the other one was kind of like from China.
Come climb.

2047
01:47:38.340 --> 01:47:41.220
I think she's married to Kevin Kline.
Haven't caused the Jonathan Taylor.
Oh,

2048
01:47:41.250 --> 01:47:44.250
Kevin Kline.
I thought it,
I'm thinking of a different Kevin Shit.

2049
01:47:44.400 --> 01:47:48.710
We're talking goddammit.
Whether if she's still,
she's still,

2050
01:47:49.760 --> 01:47:53.280
she kind of looks like a,
she got smushed against a wall on her.

2051
01:47:53.290 --> 01:47:57.040
I EMTB see how thick it looks like.
She just got sky hopes.
You damp,
right?

2052
01:47:57.041 --> 01:47:59.550
It's still pretty.
It's fun.
It would suck.

2053
01:48:01.830 --> 01:48:06.780
Lara Flynn Boyle.
She's 18 pounds.
I saw her at a photo.

2054
01:48:07.130 --> 01:48:11.100
She was walking on the beach and she looked like like,
like she was from Kenya.

2055
01:48:11.160 --> 01:48:12.720
I saw she was a stick figure.

2056
01:48:12.960 --> 01:48:15.950
I saw her maybe a couple of years ago and she just married some guy and she's

2057
01:48:15.990 --> 01:48:17.550
like,
this is my new husband and his poor guy.

2058
01:48:17.551 --> 01:48:21.690
Just like a regular fell out of Texas,
like a accountant or like has no idea.

2059
01:48:22.190 --> 01:48:25.020
Of course.
He's like,
yeah,
I'm in an area,
a movie star.
Sure.

2060
01:48:25.021 --> 01:48:28.710
If she's loving and just trying to keep it together.
Oh Man,
I've,

2061
01:48:28.830 --> 01:48:31.680
I've seen those before.
There's nothing sadder than a do who's on a ride?

2062
01:48:31.681 --> 01:48:35.880
He doesn't understand.
So true.
That's so true.

2063
01:48:35.940 --> 01:48:39.270
Regular civilian.
One's a married,
some crazy movie stars and stuff.

2064
01:48:39.271 --> 01:48:43.830
Fuck Jack Nicholson.
It'll decent texts that fell to,
oh,
I know.

2065
01:48:43.860 --> 01:48:47.520
Good luck with all your fucking country logic.
Stupid.
This shit.
I go to work.

2066
01:48:47.540 --> 01:48:51.210
I'll change him.
What has been the weirdest thing about,

2067
01:48:51.270 --> 01:48:55.650
about common here and you know,
starting out,
you know,
doing all the,
you know,

2068
01:48:55.651 --> 01:48:58.460
working for the comedy store and doing all that shit and then eventually winding

2069
01:48:58.500 --> 01:49:00.270
up on television and starting to make money.

2070
01:49:00.390 --> 01:49:02.130
What's been the weirdest part about it to you?

2071
01:49:03.150 --> 01:49:08.040
I think it's the weirdest part is for me it's like the distance put in between,

2072
01:49:08.650 --> 01:49:09.210
um,

2073
01:49:09.210 --> 01:49:12.660
some of your peers that you started with because there's this idea that comedy's

2074
01:49:12.661 --> 01:49:15.630
like freshmen football,
I'd been at it long enough,
I should get my shot,

2075
01:49:15.631 --> 01:49:18.760
but it's bull shit.
Some guys just haven't Reza rial,

2076
01:49:18.790 --> 01:49:20.490
but that itself that you're not good.

2077
01:49:20.550 --> 01:49:24.270
There's resentment among some guys that don't become successful about people who

2078
01:49:24.271 --> 01:49:26.510
are,
and it's really something sad too because it's,

2079
01:49:26.540 --> 01:49:29.220
it's one of these things where it's like,
you know,
we started off 10 years ago,

2080
01:49:29.221 --> 01:49:30.220
a bunch of us together,
me,

2081
01:49:30.221 --> 01:49:33.800
he kept Barolo is easy and it worked for some of us and for some it Dennis,

2082
01:49:33.870 --> 01:49:36.660
and it doesn't mean that it's owed to you because like I said,

2083
01:49:36.661 --> 01:49:39.450
it's like it's really hard.
Even if you're really good.

2084
01:49:39.451 --> 01:49:43.410
It's really hard and you're not,
Hollywood doesn't owe anybody any town,

2085
01:49:43.440 --> 01:49:44.251
not a damn thing.

2086
01:49:44.251 --> 01:49:46.530
And it didn't ask you to come here and it doesn't tell you when to leave,

2087
01:49:46.531 --> 01:49:47.980
but you got to know,
you know

2088
01:49:47.980 --> 01:49:50.560
<v 1>there's some people like you'll get it at the comedy store,
like guys be like,</v>

2089
01:49:50.561 --> 01:49:52.300
Oh man,
screw this store.
I don't get spots there.

2090
01:49:52.301 --> 01:49:54.220
But it's like tell me the other clubs that are giving you spots,

2091
01:49:54.250 --> 01:49:57.910
they can never name what you know.
And if they do,
it's some hole in the wall.

2092
01:49:58.450 --> 01:50:02.800
But if it's like comedy is the most justified art forum and you know there's

2093
01:50:02.801 --> 01:50:05.790
enough,
the audience is right there to tell you whether you're any good.

2094
01:50:05.860 --> 01:50:06.880
When I lived in Boston,

2095
01:50:06.881 --> 01:50:10.240
it was a shocking when guys would go somewhere and like get sitcoms,

2096
01:50:10.241 --> 01:50:12.790
are being movies.
You know what the local headliners would go.

2097
01:50:12.880 --> 01:50:15.100
He's a fucking Middle Act,
sky's the Middle Act.

2098
01:50:15.101 --> 01:50:18.430
And he's in a movie like to them it's like they didn't get there.

2099
01:50:18.431 --> 01:50:20.780
So that was a big attitude amongst Boston guy,

2100
01:50:20.830 --> 01:50:25.120
especially after Steven Wright hit,
oh,
it's a great documentary about Boston.

2101
01:50:25.600 --> 01:50:29.350
I forget what it's called.
S fucking shit.

2102
01:50:31.270 --> 01:50:36.220
Boston comedy.
We look up documentary on big sale for the laughter died.

2103
01:50:36.580 --> 01:50:39.500
I don't know what the fuck is his name?
Boston common.
The scene there,

2104
01:50:39.910 --> 01:50:41.020
there's a fantastic scene,

2105
01:50:41.021 --> 01:50:44.840
but the problem was the all the headliners that were the,

2106
01:50:44.841 --> 01:50:48.940
the main part of the movement in like the 70s and the eighties especially the

2107
01:50:48.940 --> 01:50:51.790
eighties all the guys who are like literally the most talented comedians in the

2108
01:50:51.791 --> 01:50:54.910
country,
they stayed in Boston and they just burnt out.

2109
01:50:54.911 --> 01:50:59.640
They did coke and they fucking tardy.
Didn't Y'all owed the IRS a million dollar?

2110
01:51:00.190 --> 01:51:02.470
They were fucking savages and they didn't write.

2111
01:51:02.500 --> 01:51:03.880
They didn't write a lot of new material,

2112
01:51:03.881 --> 01:51:08.740
but back then in those days I would put them up against any comic ever so people

2113
01:51:08.741 --> 01:51:09.670
had spent ever heard before.

2114
01:51:09.671 --> 01:51:12.760
I probably would put Don Gavin up against any comic I've ever seen ever.

2115
01:51:12.761 --> 01:51:17.110
As far as craftsmanship,
skill,
delivery,
timing,
confidence,

2116
01:51:17.410 --> 01:51:20.950
passion.
I'm not,
not even passionate,
I should say co just just,

2117
01:51:20.980 --> 01:51:25.310
just his charisma on stage.
His ability to just get,
get you to laugh.

2118
01:51:25.750 --> 01:51:29.110
Just a perfectly timed joke.
It just was a killer.

2119
01:51:29.140 --> 01:51:32.350
They don't like to leave the neighborhood.
Know how they got rich there.
I mean,

2120
01:51:32.351 --> 01:51:34.090
when you're making,
you know,

2121
01:51:34.270 --> 01:51:37.310
several thousand dollars a week doing comedy in Boston,
well also,

2122
01:51:37.311 --> 01:51:40.720
and you've got to go on the road and you're going to make one fourth that people

2123
01:51:40.721 --> 01:51:43.360
are going to not come out to see you.
You know you're doing the punch line.

2124
01:51:43.361 --> 01:51:44.270
Atlanta don't get,

2125
01:51:44.460 --> 01:51:47.620
they don't know who the fuck you are so that it's half full crowds and they

2126
01:51:47.621 --> 01:51:50.200
don't care about Boston so they don't want to hear all your Boston jokes,

2127
01:51:50.290 --> 01:51:52.140
which are your best jokes.
Right.
You know,

2128
01:51:52.150 --> 01:51:55.450
there's a lot of guys that have all this Boston centric material in Boston and

2129
01:51:55.451 --> 01:51:58.660
they will rush with it,
rush with it.

2130
01:51:59.110 --> 01:52:01.720
But if you go to Virginia,
they don't give a fuck about ball.

2131
01:52:01.960 --> 01:52:03.790
You want to talk about Denis leary in that scene?

2132
01:52:03.791 --> 01:52:05.560
Like who are all who came out of Anders in the scene.

2133
01:52:05.561 --> 01:52:08.470
He kind of got out of seeing pretty quick though.
He got out of a scene with his,

2134
01:52:08.471 --> 01:52:08.820
uh,

2135
01:52:08.820 --> 01:52:13.820
the MTV shit and then with his first special where he got all the comparisons to

2136
01:52:13.901 --> 01:52:17.290
Hex,
surely everybody's going to steal and Hicks material.
I've seen those,

2137
01:52:17.350 --> 01:52:22.330
those uh,
the different ones in their entirety.
Yeah,
they're interesting.

2138
01:52:23.260 --> 01:52:27.910
Very interesting.
Yeah.
Pretty obvious.
Well obvious.
Yeah.
He was a hack.

2139
01:52:27.970 --> 01:52:30.940
If from the beginning it's really sad.
It's like,
you know,

2140
01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.130
but he's Oh God to just was real,
super ambitious,

2141
01:52:33.131 --> 01:52:36.310
just wanted to make it and this is his thing.
He found this thing,
you know,

2142
01:52:36.311 --> 01:52:39.700
you created,
crafted this character and then all of a sudden,
you know,

2143
01:52:39.701 --> 01:52:41.470
he needed some material to go along with it.

2144
01:52:41.470 --> 01:52:44.860
So just kind of copied whatever the other people said that was cool and reworked

2145
01:52:44.861 --> 01:52:45.980
it and was very obvious.

2146
01:52:45.981 --> 01:52:49.160
I see that happen with some guys especially who had been just for a few short

2147
01:52:49.161 --> 01:52:53.670
years and they'll get an opportunity.
I'll see those guys do that for tea,

2148
01:52:53.780 --> 01:52:57.020
just to survive.
It's one of the biggest problems with a guy like stealing.
Yeah.

2149
01:52:57.140 --> 01:52:59.810
It's Delia and is a few other guys in town,
you know,
where they are.

2150
01:53:00.080 --> 01:53:03.650
And there's a few guys that are doing well and they're doing well by doing just

2151
01:53:03.651 --> 01:53:06.200
that.
And it's blatantly obvious to young kids coming up.

2152
01:53:06.560 --> 01:53:10.040
So instead of like when I started out in Boston,
I mean you were,

2153
01:53:10.070 --> 01:53:13.070
you were like ostracized.
If you are a thief,
you're a hack,

2154
01:53:13.071 --> 01:53:14.290
you were your point MP.

2155
01:53:14.300 --> 01:53:17.180
There was mistakes and sometimes people come up with jokes,

2156
01:53:17.181 --> 01:53:19.820
they don't even know that somebody else had said it.
I've seen it before.

2157
01:53:19.821 --> 01:53:22.760
It happens all the time itself.
There's mistakes and then there's,
you know,

2158
01:53:22.761 --> 01:53:24.620
people forget that they heard the joke before.

2159
01:53:25.100 --> 01:53:29.210
There's all sorts of shit that people have parallel thinking that's possible
too.

2160
01:53:29.480 --> 01:53:31.370
But there comes a point in time when you watch and do,

2161
01:53:31.371 --> 01:53:34.100
it's where you know they've seen someone before and you know,

2162
01:53:34.101 --> 01:53:38.090
oh he's just doing this and reworking it and changing it.
Making it this way.

2163
01:53:38.120 --> 01:53:39.610
Right.
Cause there's such a specific,
like a,

2164
01:53:39.630 --> 01:53:42.710
you know the thing obviously the Carlos thing that to the bill Cosby thing,

2165
01:53:42.711 --> 01:53:47.540
it's like that.
So still not common thinking,
my God,
he's a,
he's a sociopath.

2166
01:53:47.570 --> 01:53:51.710
There's some dude's got a disc in a,
you hear him on the mark man podcast.

2167
01:53:51.830 --> 01:53:54.080
I heard the Lord God and I'm good.

2168
01:53:54.081 --> 01:53:56.510
Good for mark for having them back the second time.
As Mark said,
you know,

2169
01:53:56.530 --> 01:54:00.450
I don't feel good about that.
I feel like the first thing was gross.
Yeah,

2170
01:54:00.451 --> 01:54:03.430
that's why he said because he was embarrassed by how gross sounds.

2171
01:54:04.280 --> 01:54:07.100
It wasn't just soft balls.
It was like he was like saying,

2172
01:54:07.101 --> 01:54:09.510
well you got there through comedy.
At least you did it through.

2173
01:54:10.180 --> 01:54:13.460
I don't know what the fuck that means.
You're a real comedian.

2174
01:54:13.930 --> 01:54:16.800
You mean you like comedy?
It's like,
come on,

2175
01:54:16.801 --> 01:54:21.260
what is this thing is he has this thing for people who've made it through
comedy,

2176
01:54:21.410 --> 01:54:24.290
you know?
He thinks that's the right way.
All these other people have sold out

2177
01:54:25.910 --> 01:54:28.460
and you didn't do it the right way,
but it's like,
good luck dude.
Go.

2178
01:54:28.461 --> 01:54:32.570
Grossest thing about the the marathon was that he's thought that the video that

2179
01:54:32.571 --> 01:54:34.010
Brian and I made,
he said,

2180
01:54:34.011 --> 01:54:36.920
I think it should have been handled through the community.
That's what I said.

2181
01:54:36.950 --> 01:54:38.990
Yes.
Then we could have been handled so well.

2182
01:54:38.990 --> 01:54:42.590
Like how has it ever been handled to the community?
Ever name one time.

2183
01:54:42.770 --> 01:54:45.530
They don't give a fuck the key.
That was the whole purpose for the whole thing.

2184
01:54:45.740 --> 01:54:47.030
The community didn't give a fuck.

2185
01:54:47.150 --> 01:54:50.360
They all knew he was stealing and everyone for comedy central knew he was

2186
01:54:50.361 --> 01:54:54.320
stealing.
Everybody that worked on the set on that show.
I knew writers,

2187
01:54:54.321 --> 01:54:57.500
they all knew he was stealing.
This was not,
no one was stopping this.

2188
01:54:57.590 --> 01:55:01.040
And then Marin says this and then he goes and has him on for fucking three hours

2189
01:55:01.041 --> 01:55:04.640
talking about it and tell it should have been handled into the queue with the

2190
01:55:04.641 --> 01:55:05.700
community inside the community.

2191
01:55:05.730 --> 01:55:07.790
You just talked about it for three hours on a pod.

2192
01:55:08.030 --> 01:55:11.900
Broadcasting to the community video was 10 minutes long mark.
Yeah,
exactly.

2193
01:55:13.090 --> 01:55:15.080
But he's one of those dudes.
Marin is one of those.

2194
01:55:15.140 --> 01:55:18.620
I remember that night and God damn it,
if that didn't really expose them,

2195
01:55:18.621 --> 01:55:21.320
if that didn't work.
Oh it worked.
It did work.

2196
01:55:21.770 --> 01:55:24.200
It's straight now out straightened out a real problem.

2197
01:55:24.230 --> 01:55:27.350
It was amazing to see Marin's comparisons were so ridiculous cause he was like,

2198
01:55:27.351 --> 01:55:30.320
you know,
he's talking about parallel thinking or guys sounding like guys,
that's,

2199
01:55:30.321 --> 01:55:32.240
yes,
those are obviously,

2200
01:55:32.360 --> 01:55:35.600
there's a very real circumstances in happens in amongst comics.
I mean,

2201
01:55:35.601 --> 01:55:39.050
I found myself many times my career sounding like other comedians and I admired,

2202
01:55:39.500 --> 01:55:42.850
but there's a big different screens and it's ganking people.
Sure.
We're all,

2203
01:55:42.920 --> 01:55:46.510
he was doing it blatantly in front of everybody all the time.
I mean it's,

2204
01:55:46.511 --> 01:55:50.130
it's crazy.
It's done for him.
And he's a pariah,
right?
Yes.
He is.
What he is,

2205
01:55:50.131 --> 01:55:50.790
he is his,

2206
01:55:50.790 --> 01:55:53.490
his audience has been reduced to what it should have been in the first place

2207
01:55:53.670 --> 01:55:56.820
where people without an Internet connection and people who are so stupid,

2208
01:55:56.821 --> 01:55:59.820
they don't care if you're full of shit.
What,
what kind of,
what kind of,

2209
01:55:59.910 --> 01:56:02.220
what does he look at it as?
He's doing theaters.
How,
how's it going?
Good.

2210
01:56:02.221 --> 01:56:03.840
I'm sure he's making a living.
Right.
You know,
look,

2211
01:56:03.841 --> 01:56:06.450
there's plenty of retards out there,
Brenda.
I think we'll get back on TV.

2212
01:56:06.460 --> 01:56:09.060
Nascar is huge.
Uh,
and you know,
I mean,

2213
01:56:09.061 --> 01:56:11.190
I'm not saying there's anything wrong with fast cars right now.

2214
01:56:11.220 --> 01:56:13.230
They're pretty fucking cool.
I would love to even,

2215
01:56:13.320 --> 01:56:15.450
wouldn't even mind going to see one lot,
right?

2216
01:56:15.451 --> 01:56:17.870
If you're looking in the audience and Nascar,
oh,
there's still,

2217
01:56:17.871 --> 01:56:21.630
there's people out there,
man,
and there's a lot of them.

2218
01:56:22.020 --> 01:56:25.500
And then Fuck Harry wrong.
He would see those Sarah Pailin book signing line.

2219
01:56:25.530 --> 01:56:27.060
Oh yeah.
The looks on them.

2220
01:56:29.200 --> 01:56:31.510
The teabag or rally listen to the looks on,
oh,

2221
01:56:31.650 --> 01:56:34.140
it's like you hate to lump people in state,
but it's like,
come on,

2222
01:56:34.141 --> 01:56:38.550
there's so many of them.
Let's talk about the live in a nerf society.

2223
01:56:38.551 --> 01:56:42.810
We live in a society that makes it real easy for these pussies to get by and

2224
01:56:42.811 --> 01:56:46.830
they just turn out dumb and simple and they want to be around other dumb simple

2225
01:56:46.831 --> 01:56:51.530
people and they want to fight it.
Well,

2226
01:56:51.650 --> 01:56:54.340
my grandfather died fighting footage,
man,

2227
01:56:55.110 --> 01:56:58.470
shut the fuck up.
I have kids and you just look at the kids.
You're like,

2228
01:56:58.471 --> 01:57:03.210
there's no blood clot for progress.
You dumped.

2229
01:57:03.211 --> 01:57:04.830
Fuck.
And that's the problem with voting.

2230
01:57:04.831 --> 01:57:08.310
The problem with voting is there's at least as many of them as there are people

2231
01:57:08.311 --> 01:57:11.340
that are sensible and there's a lot of people that are sensible that are barely

2232
01:57:11.341 --> 01:57:12.480
keeping it together.

2233
01:57:12.600 --> 01:57:16.560
The stress of modern day society is too much for the fucking mortal body.

2234
01:57:16.890 --> 01:57:20.190
People's bodies are not meant for fucking four hours every day and traffic and

2235
01:57:20.200 --> 01:57:21.033
bullshit,

2236
01:57:21.090 --> 01:57:23.790
fucking stress at work because you have to pretend to be someone that you're not

2237
01:57:23.820 --> 01:57:26.850
because you want to keep your job.
So you have to listen to his fucking cunt bag.

2238
01:57:26.851 --> 01:57:29.310
Stupid Retard boss.
The only reason he's in there,

2239
01:57:29.311 --> 01:57:32.040
cause he married the fucking boss's daughter and Holy Shit,

2240
01:57:32.041 --> 01:57:36.120
you're losing your marbles bro,
and you start falling apart at the seams.
Well,

2241
01:57:36.121 --> 01:57:38.370
you can vote too.
You can go to and you don't have your,

2242
01:57:38.400 --> 01:57:40.620
you don't have your brain in order.
You're not making good decisions.

2243
01:57:40.621 --> 01:57:43.860
Your whole life's a God damn mess.
Here's what we got a problem here.

2244
01:57:43.870 --> 01:57:48.150
We've got damn liberals want to take my pack fees.
That's not the problem.

2245
01:57:48.151 --> 01:57:50.760
We got a bigger problem with the way much of a problem.

2246
01:57:51.090 --> 01:57:55.410
We're moving in a direction and no one has analyzed the direction which is
going.

2247
01:57:55.470 --> 01:57:58.950
It's just amazing when those people though that they think if you make less than

2248
01:57:58.951 --> 01:58:03.540
$200,000 a year,
you're not Republican.
I hate to tell you what,
you're just not,

2249
01:58:04.140 --> 01:58:06.080
you're not a real one.
You don't know what you're doing,

2250
01:58:06.100 --> 01:58:09.060
don't know what you're doing and you're not servicing a party that's made for

2251
01:58:09.061 --> 01:58:09.420
you.

2252
01:58:09.420 --> 01:58:14.100
He's an amazing that they've managed to connect like being like good folk and

2253
01:58:14.101 --> 01:58:16.800
being like good God,
guns and government,

2254
01:58:16.980 --> 01:58:19.530
they've managed to connect all that together with big business.

2255
01:58:19.531 --> 01:58:21.510
It doesn't give a fuck about you or the environment.

2256
01:58:21.870 --> 01:58:24.360
Like they've managed connect,
connect,
hunting and fishing.

2257
01:58:24.660 --> 01:58:26.760
Like Bush would always be hunting and you know,

2258
01:58:26.761 --> 01:58:30.150
fucking the famous thing where Dick Cheney shot his friend in the face,
you know,

2259
01:58:30.151 --> 01:58:33.170
and Sarah Payne,
Lindsey,
are we shooting all the conservatives,

2260
01:58:33.190 --> 01:58:37.020
all the ones who want to let these fucking raping companies just continue these

2261
01:58:37.021 --> 01:58:42.021
Monsanto's and fucking Halliburton's continue to fucking just crush across the

2262
01:58:42.701 --> 01:58:44.830
world.
These are,
these are the hunters and they get,

2263
01:58:44.850 --> 01:58:48.340
they get the people like that.
Like the payer lens and it's,
it's cool.

2264
01:58:48.341 --> 01:58:52.690
It's chic now and especially in this election,
to be dumb,
to not know anything.

2265
01:58:52.691 --> 01:58:57.640
Ignorance is now celebrated in politics.
Elite is a Ms Poo pooed in shadow.
Oh,

2266
01:58:57.641 --> 01:59:01.240
he went to an Ivy League school.
That's a good thing.
That's a good thing.

2267
01:59:01.241 --> 01:59:03.870
When you go to an Ivy League school,
he doesn't understand us.

2268
01:59:03.880 --> 01:59:06.590
He doesn't understand us.
Regular folks.
No regular folks should know.

2269
01:59:06.670 --> 01:59:10.000
People are started out on my dad's farm.
Yeah.
Whoa,
Whoa,
whoa.

2270
01:59:10.300 --> 01:59:12.880
What books have you read?
Right?
Why the fuck are you going to be the leader?

2271
01:59:12.950 --> 01:59:17.080
Right?
What does exceptional about your philosophy?
What is it?
He said,

2272
01:59:17.230 --> 01:59:20.710
we're getting people that are just good talkers.
That's all we require,

2273
01:59:21.280 --> 01:59:24.550
which required him to be able to target in public and look like someone who

2274
01:59:24.551 --> 01:59:27.640
could be leader.
The president should be the smartest person in the room.
Right,

2275
01:59:27.641 --> 01:59:31.900
but is that possible?
I don't think that the whole world needs leaders.

2276
01:59:32.140 --> 01:59:34.270
I think that the way we exist right now,

2277
01:59:34.271 --> 01:59:38.650
we exist in the same manner that they existed when they was 500 monkey people to

2278
01:59:38.651 --> 01:59:43.150
a group and they all had a fight off the,
the,
the,
the coming tribes,
other tribes.

2279
01:59:43.151 --> 01:59:44.530
It would come and try to steal their shit.

2280
01:59:44.890 --> 01:59:47.620
And they all had to rely on the baddest motherfucker who was the guy who's been

2281
01:59:47.621 --> 01:59:50.800
around the longest,
he's ago,
knows how to escape.
He knows the trails,

2282
01:59:50.801 --> 01:59:53.500
he knows where the food is in the woods.
He knows the best places to hide.

2283
01:59:53.760 --> 01:59:56.290
You know,
I think the president should be Miss America.

2284
01:59:56.350 --> 02:00:01.330
Every year we get to look at a hot,
new sexy president.
Kimbrow
happy,

2285
02:00:01.331 --> 02:00:05.020
awesome.
Like the president gives speeches and like fucking swimsuits and stuff.

2286
02:00:05.050 --> 02:00:07.930
That'd be,
and you know,
it's hard to tell too,
it's like,
think about this,

2287
02:00:07.931 --> 02:00:10.450
like Obama,
he's only been in two years and it's like,
you know,

2288
02:00:10.550 --> 02:00:12.820
and he didn't make a good point on Jon Stewart show.
He's like,

2289
02:00:12.850 --> 02:00:17.800
I didn't guarantee this shit overnight.
Well,
here's the thing,
can it be fixed?

2290
02:00:17.940 --> 02:00:22.360
It doesn't.
It seem like it's built on a foundation of unfixable shit.

2291
02:00:22.530 --> 02:00:24.970
It seems like the the w our stock market,

2292
02:00:24.971 --> 02:00:27.700
this tie Eeb article that I was reading about the stock market when he was

2293
02:00:27.701 --> 02:00:31.960
talking about how many companies are betting against BP,

2294
02:00:32.230 --> 02:00:37.230
that there's like this gigantic derivatives market where people get to gamble on

2295
02:00:37.601 --> 02:00:41.260
whether or not some someone defaults on their loans and gamble whether or not a

2296
02:00:41.261 --> 02:00:43.270
company can succeed and repay loans.

2297
02:00:43.390 --> 02:00:45.970
And there's like this shadow economy that's based on all that.

2298
02:00:46.540 --> 02:00:48.640
It's a mind fuck.

2299
02:00:48.641 --> 02:00:52.780
That is what I've always said about this is if they can rip off accountants,

2300
02:00:52.930 --> 02:00:55.750
how crazy is this shit?
How crazy is this shit for real?

2301
02:00:56.230 --> 02:00:59.710
You and I who know nothing about the economy,
they're ripping off accountants.

2302
02:00:59.890 --> 02:01:02.020
That's how deep this fucking web,

2303
02:01:02.050 --> 02:01:06.130
they're creating non tangible things to make tangible money and they're getting

2304
02:01:06.131 --> 02:01:09.130
away with it somehow or another getting away with it and then instead of like

2305
02:01:09.250 --> 02:01:11.620
fixing and putting in a totally new operating system,
they're,

2306
02:01:11.621 --> 02:01:16.000
they're just putting up new paths and new parts of the registry and new pathways

2307
02:01:16.001 --> 02:01:17.260
and they'll talk about that.
That's,

2308
02:01:17.261 --> 02:01:20.860
that's what stifles America's growth in a lot of ways.
Like in Japan and China,

2309
02:01:20.861 --> 02:01:23.950
their Internet is just far superior to ours because it really,

2310
02:01:24.100 --> 02:01:28.300
cause we use the preexisting structure they have,
they have,
um,

2311
02:01:28.690 --> 02:01:31.960
what do they use the,
um,
what's it called?
Fiber optic fiber.

2312
02:01:32.200 --> 02:01:35.860
And see we have a preexisting,
a copper and kind of old school wiring.

2313
02:01:35.861 --> 02:01:39.230
That's why the cable companies and the Internet have never really gotten in bed

2314
02:01:39.231 --> 02:01:43.220
in this country everywhere else that Internet TV's normal really to access the

2315
02:01:43.221 --> 02:01:45.740
web from your TV and have it just don't really do that now.

2316
02:01:47.410 --> 02:01:49.910
Like it's a 40 inch or,
yeah,
they've got TV,
Internet,

2317
02:01:50.330 --> 02:01:53.170
everything from your team and they should have that and that and that,

2318
02:01:53.300 --> 02:01:55.490
that technology has been available for 10 fucking years.

2319
02:01:55.491 --> 02:01:57.950
They should have been doing this.
I think there's been a lot of resistance.

2320
02:01:57.990 --> 02:02:02.540
The cable companies are big time.
Like they run a fucking major made.

2321
02:02:02.570 --> 02:02:06.070
You want to talk some serious,
you know,
con artists.
It's a cable company.
Yeah.

2322
02:02:06.260 --> 02:02:08.330
Oh for sure.
And then the internet popped up.

2323
02:02:08.360 --> 02:02:11.060
We already had a preexisting structure and so China never had one,

2324
02:02:11.061 --> 02:02:12.740
so they just built all fucking new one.
It's like,

2325
02:02:12.741 --> 02:02:15.650
look at us like they laugh at our Internet.
It's instant,

2326
02:02:16.470 --> 02:02:20.210
instant do whenever I do a thread on your message board with like speed tests,

2327
02:02:20.270 --> 02:02:22.160
it's like I'm all proud of my,
you know,

2328
02:02:22.180 --> 02:02:25.880
through whatever 30 megabyte download connection but then be 30 minutes,

2329
02:02:25.910 --> 02:02:30.080
something like that.
Yeah,
and it's just the Uverse and t Uverse cat damp 30 mags.

2330
02:02:30.081 --> 02:02:31.520
Yeah,
but then you look at,

2331
02:02:31.521 --> 02:02:35.990
you look at other people's and they're like 88 89 I remember when I used to play

2332
02:02:35.991 --> 02:02:39.710
quake,
there was dudes,
it would get like four ping,
their ping would be like four.

2333
02:02:39.711 --> 02:02:41.780
I'm like,
how was this?
Are you in the room with the server?

2334
02:02:42.140 --> 02:02:45.950
How are you getting for it would just on some crazy fat fucking cable pipe.

2335
02:02:46.600 --> 02:02:50.870
When cable cable Internet first came around and everybody else had like Isd n Oh

2336
02:02:50.871 --> 02:02:54.820
my God,
you would,
you could get online and rape them.
Right.
Were like frozen.
They,

2337
02:02:55.080 --> 02:02:58.960
this shit would be like they'd have a 150 ping from like a 56 k modem or an eye

2338
02:02:58.961 --> 02:03:03.320
I SDN line and what Ping is the amount of milliseconds it takes between the

2339
02:03:03.321 --> 02:03:05.300
actual action and it happened all right.

2340
02:03:05.300 --> 02:03:07.670
You would have to lead like if you want to shoot a guy with a real gun,

2341
02:03:07.671 --> 02:03:09.870
you'd have to assume that he was going to keep running in the same direction.

2342
02:03:09.900 --> 02:03:10.970
You would actually lead him.

2343
02:03:11.120 --> 02:03:13.820
So you had aim right in front of him with a real gun and hit.

2344
02:03:13.821 --> 02:03:18.330
You'd have to plan in your mind for 150 millisecond.
Oh Wow.
Yeah.

2345
02:03:18.500 --> 02:03:20.780
You guys were really good.
There was guys that will kill you.

2346
02:03:20.781 --> 02:03:24.860
They would fuck you up even with a lag because his day because he knew how to

2347
02:03:24.861 --> 02:03:28.200
time the lag and they knew like what weapons were good to like to like you know

2348
02:03:28.280 --> 02:03:32.300
deal with the non non specific aiming that you had to employ.

2349
02:03:32.400 --> 02:03:35.700
That's pretty damn smart dude.
There was incredible good dudes become you.

2350
02:03:35.720 --> 02:03:39.920
You get tuned into it and you become like one of the things about like video

2351
02:03:39.921 --> 02:03:43.160
games,
it's like your,
your fast twitch and your movements and everything.

2352
02:03:43.370 --> 02:03:45.740
They become in tune with the parameters of the game.

2353
02:03:45.770 --> 02:03:48.660
Well they say that that teaches kids skills today that is helping their motors

2354
02:03:48.670 --> 02:03:51.050
cause cause I played that grand theft auto but I never sold cars.

2355
02:03:51.051 --> 02:03:52.720
I would go play this,
uh,
the,
the,

2356
02:03:52.721 --> 02:03:55.640
the free mode where you can just run around the city and wreak havoc and you

2357
02:03:55.641 --> 02:03:58.700
start to develop a lifestyle.
I became a sniper or a really good one.

2358
02:03:58.701 --> 02:04:02.120
I was Lee Harvey Oswald and I would stop people.
I was really,

2359
02:04:02.121 --> 02:04:05.870
really good at it and I would go sit on top of buildings and I would call you on

2360
02:04:05.871 --> 02:04:09.020
the cell phone because he had the ear piece and the guy would be like,
hello?

2361
02:04:09.200 --> 02:04:11.210
Like say cheese motherfucker.
Boom,

2362
02:04:11.240 --> 02:04:15.680
right off I'm from a skyscraper and it's like I started living this life and

2363
02:04:15.681 --> 02:04:18.590
just,
I just,
I would get thrills out of it.
I'd get excited.

2364
02:04:18.591 --> 02:04:21.050
I'd be proud of myself.
I got really good flying a helicopter.

2365
02:04:21.051 --> 02:04:25.280
It's fucking hard to fly a helicopter.
I wouldn't always do.

2366
02:04:26.240 --> 02:04:30.890
Everybody get in the helicopter?
I,
yeah,
I him about,

2367
02:04:31.940 --> 02:04:36.710
I laughed my ass off and you blow them up and you left.
Oh you just a job.

2368
02:04:36.890 --> 02:04:38.130
Yeah,
you'll commit suicide.

2369
02:04:38.130 --> 02:04:41.820
<v 3>But it Larry them cause that work cause they're like well look book or I was</v>

2370
02:04:41.821 --> 02:04:45.210
working on something over cause it goes over in Brooklyn.

2371
02:04:45.211 --> 02:04:48.380
You take me all the way over here to do this.
You fucking Dick Dude.
That's shit.

2372
02:04:48.490 --> 02:04:53.430
Or where you landed on top of like the Statue of Liberty.
Yeah.
It's just so fun.

2373
02:04:53.431 --> 02:04:56.040
You go around exploring,
there's no rules and you just run a muck.

2374
02:04:56.041 --> 02:04:59.310
But after awhile there is kind of like an understanding.

2375
02:04:59.311 --> 02:05:02.670
Like if you see another dude,
like sometimes the doodle just come up with beef,

2376
02:05:02.671 --> 02:05:06.030
like doing drive bys on you.
You're like all right,

2377
02:05:06.240 --> 02:05:09.310
but that's what to do to walk up and want to hang out.
Those are the guys.

2378
02:05:09.311 --> 02:05:12.960
You take her a ride.
I Roll Solo.
I'm Charles Bronson and that fucking feeling,

2379
02:05:12.990 --> 02:05:15.450
I ain't hanging out with nobody.
Right.
You get in my car,
I'm going to,

2380
02:05:15.451 --> 02:05:17.160
you're going to get got there.
You're done with.

2381
02:05:17.480 --> 02:05:19.670
I'm going to embarrass your people.
My Jack People.

2382
02:05:20.150 --> 02:05:24.030
I have no friends in liberty city.
Poor Matt.

2383
02:05:24.031 --> 02:05:26.990
The door got the comedy store was like,
Hey,
let's meet up man.
Give me your code.

2384
02:05:26.991 --> 02:05:28.470
And I was like,
yeah,
all right,
let's go right up.

2385
02:05:30.720 --> 02:05:34.020
I was like,
it's just the way it goes and liberty city homie,

2386
02:05:36.580 --> 02:05:37.413
dudes get hurt.

2387
02:05:39.190 --> 02:05:42.840
Why make friends if I can shoot you suffer?

2388
02:05:42.841 --> 02:05:46.870
No repercussions for it.
I'm going love friends in real life.
I'm a,

2389
02:05:46.920 --> 02:05:49.980
I'm a lone wolf in that fucking city.
Hilarious.

2390
02:05:49.981 --> 02:05:53.070
Grab a car and listen to some tunes.
Go do drive by some people.

2391
02:05:53.520 --> 02:05:55.590
<v 1>Police.
That game is so much fun.</v>

2392
02:05:55.650 --> 02:05:59.850
Now do you do this online with a piece doing with Xbox?
Do it online with what?

2393
02:05:59.880 --> 02:06:04.880
The ps three and a half fucking hate game controllers that had to get over it.

2394
02:06:04.921 --> 02:06:07.830
You need to do play it for a month and you'll get this to it.
Oh,
you only do it.

2395
02:06:07.831 --> 02:06:11.160
You only do a computer,
mouse and keyboards better.
Just better period.

2396
02:06:11.161 --> 02:06:13.920
I've tried both.
I understand the appeal of a little game control.

2397
02:06:13.921 --> 02:06:16.680
It is not as specific graphics better and computer.

2398
02:06:16.681 --> 02:06:20.130
I'll just always the graphics by the resolution's better but more importantly

2399
02:06:20.131 --> 02:06:22.530
when you're in front of the screen like you,
you're dealing with,

2400
02:06:22.560 --> 02:06:25.020
you know like you shouldn't be dealing with if you really want to pay attention

2401
02:06:25.021 --> 02:06:27.990
more than 21 inches,
right?
21 inch.
Do you want a small screen?

2402
02:06:28.020 --> 02:06:29.400
It's not too big cause otherwise your,

2403
02:06:29.430 --> 02:06:31.080
your eyes are not going to be to keep up with everything.

2404
02:06:31.080 --> 02:06:33.720
Right about the house and a keyboard is way better.
Yeah.

2405
02:06:34.170 --> 02:06:36.900
You can move much more specifically with a mouse and a keyboard.

2406
02:06:36.901 --> 02:06:39.030
A mouse is way more accurate as far as aim.

2407
02:06:39.540 --> 02:06:43.410
So in fast twitch games like quake and unreal tournament and all those crazy

2408
02:06:43.411 --> 02:06:45.480
games,
grand theft auto is not like that.
Can I?

2409
02:06:45.540 --> 02:06:49.470
Can I get grand theft auto on computer?
You can but you don't need to do mouse.

2410
02:06:49.510 --> 02:06:49.870
That's a game.

2411
02:06:49.870 --> 02:06:53.310
They get that grand theft auto is not a fast twitch all bring you in.

2412
02:06:53.320 --> 02:06:56.640
Most Games aren't,
aren't moving to joy stick though.
Full range of motion.

2413
02:06:56.641 --> 02:06:59.400
Most of them are.
I've gotten so good at that Xbox controller,

2414
02:06:59.401 --> 02:07:03.630
the ps three controller that I don't even realize I'm secondary.
If you,

2415
02:07:03.890 --> 02:07:04.980
once you've done quake,

2416
02:07:05.010 --> 02:07:09.990
once you've experienced this super high adrenaline rush of really high speed,

2417
02:07:10.120 --> 02:07:14.060
three d action,
the death,
death matches,
rocket launches.

2418
02:07:14.090 --> 02:07:18.840
I'm all about that shit out,
bro.
I'm all but that's,
I don't want to regular.

2419
02:07:18.870 --> 02:07:20.840
I want a game where I can walk regular speed,
right?

2420
02:07:20.880 --> 02:07:22.590
I want to come work in rocket jump.
Okay?

2421
02:07:22.591 --> 02:07:26.130
I want to shoot a rocket at the ground and jump at the same time and go flying

2422
02:07:26.131 --> 02:07:28.350
through the air.
That's bad ass.
That's cool.

2423
02:07:29.160 --> 02:07:33.330
So many more games when you play it every time you're talking about I get bored

2424
02:07:33.331 --> 02:07:35.970
when you play death match on on boring.

2425
02:07:36.250 --> 02:07:37.790
<v 3>I like that Shit on grand theft auto,</v>

2426
02:07:37.791 --> 02:07:42.790
that death match cause death match 18 people all around the world,
all games,

2427
02:07:42.791 --> 02:07:47.380
all around the world and you just love killing somebody.
I know it's real.

2428
02:07:47.381 --> 02:07:51.190
I just know somebody I'm on the other end is on the other guy that I really

2429
02:07:51.191 --> 02:07:54.040
experienced it and I got the earpiece and everything and I'd go into rooms.

2430
02:07:54.041 --> 02:07:54.671
It'd be a bunch of like,

2431
02:07:54.671 --> 02:07:57.580
teenage boys would be like Niggas who's ready to get killed?

2432
02:08:00.040 --> 02:08:03.550
Who is this guy?
Nobody would talk shit to me.
It's amazing how a voiceover work.

2433
02:08:03.551 --> 02:08:07.130
Nobody would talk shit.
But yeah,
mother fucker had that feel.
They'd be like,

2434
02:08:08.010 --> 02:08:11.540
I'm 12 I do voices and shit all the time.
It was fucking this one.

2435
02:08:11.541 --> 02:08:14.470
So everybody's allowed to talk.
When you get in a room where everybody can talk,

2436
02:08:14.471 --> 02:08:19.090
you can mute yourself.
French,
you'll hear Chinese like,
yeah,

2437
02:08:19.091 --> 02:08:21.640
you'll hear little kids that are fighting with their mom and you're giving them

2438
02:08:21.641 --> 02:08:25.210
advice,
like throw her vagina the ladder.
Right.
And then you'll hear it.

2439
02:08:25.211 --> 02:08:27.970
You'll hear the dismay of somebody when you fuck them up in a death match.

2440
02:08:27.971 --> 02:08:31.480
And I was like,
Nasty Shit.
I was a grenade expert.
I would try,

2441
02:08:31.481 --> 02:08:32.320
I would hold it and,

2442
02:08:32.321 --> 02:08:35.200
but I do a drive by and you and drop it at the last second and take off.

2443
02:08:35.201 --> 02:08:38.770
And just fattal's world battlefield where you've just dropped like a grenade,

2444
02:08:38.771 --> 02:08:41.440
like you're driving with somebody and then you get out and you put a grenade and

2445
02:08:41.820 --> 02:08:44.530
it's so good.
I mean that guy,
I had to stop playing.

2446
02:08:44.531 --> 02:08:47.050
I had to stop playing and living my life again.
I was like,

2447
02:08:47.051 --> 02:08:49.330
I'm not living my life.
For Robert from the comedy store,

2448
02:08:49.360 --> 02:08:53.520
the manager who got addicted to world,
Robert Davies oil,
the Warcraft?
No,

2449
02:08:53.530 --> 02:08:57.370
every other one.
Everquest was Robert Davis.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2450
02:08:57.371 --> 02:08:59.380
I didn't know he was into that famous Robert Quote.

2451
02:08:59.770 --> 02:09:01.870
I say this all the time to people when I'm talking about people who are addicted

2452
02:09:01.871 --> 02:09:02.370
to games.

2453
02:09:02.370 --> 02:09:05.740
We were in the back of the comedy store back by the bar area and he goes,

2454
02:09:05.741 --> 02:09:08.980
it's so weird.
I'm so successful in my online life,

2455
02:09:09.220 --> 02:09:13.750
but so unsuccessful in my real life because it's online life in everquest,

2456
02:09:13.751 --> 02:09:17.430
he was a pimp.
He was like a source where with magic and shit.
Yeah,

2457
02:09:17.460 --> 02:09:19.930
he had like pet dragons in his online life.

2458
02:09:20.280 --> 02:09:22.840
There was a documentary about those people,
that world of Warcraft.

2459
02:09:22.841 --> 02:09:26.860
Did you see that one?
It was amazing.
Like how,
like what it costs dangerous.

2460
02:09:26.861 --> 02:09:28.800
It's like a bad drug habit.
It's like neuro one,

2461
02:09:28.960 --> 02:09:32.500
like dudes are having fucking kids starve because they get addicted with these

2462
02:09:32.501 --> 02:09:33.640
online role playing games.

2463
02:09:33.910 --> 02:09:37.510
I met this hot chick that was like supermodel height and I found out that she

2464
02:09:37.511 --> 02:09:38.271
was addicted to,

2465
02:09:38.271 --> 02:09:42.520
I gave my 12 hours a day and it just blew my mind and it was like,
okay,

2466
02:09:42.521 --> 02:09:44.210
this game might not be too,
I would play,

2467
02:09:44.920 --> 02:09:48.130
I would play grand theft auto probably like up to four hours a day.

2468
02:09:48.130 --> 02:09:50.480
And I felt like that was even waste.

2469
02:09:50.590 --> 02:09:54.340
Cool though to put these headphones on and not in the click and enter into a

2470
02:09:54.341 --> 02:09:58.060
world.
There's a bunch of other people online and it's a gigantic,

2471
02:09:58.061 --> 02:10:02.020
massive arena so you can wander around all these different areas.

2472
02:10:02.021 --> 02:10:04.810
One that just came out,
Bobby Lee keeps trying to get me to get,
um,

2473
02:10:04.930 --> 02:10:09.520
he plays it all the time.
It's a Las Vegas.
Oh No.
Fall out.

2474
02:10:09.521 --> 02:10:13.230
Fall out playing.
Right.
So what's your plan?
You're like,
yeah,
fuck yeah.

2475
02:10:13.260 --> 02:10:16.500
I played the first one.
[inaudible] three dude.
Fuck that.

2476
02:10:16.501 --> 02:10:18.820
If we get far three for $19 play that thing,

2477
02:10:18.850 --> 02:10:21.880
you'll fucking love it and go with B because it's the exact same game.

2478
02:10:21.881 --> 02:10:24.670
But it's in Vegas.
I look match GTA so much.

2479
02:10:24.671 --> 02:10:26.380
I'd never felt the need to play another game.

2480
02:10:26.381 --> 02:10:29.470
And then I heard metal Bonners pretty good too.
What is this fallout game like?

2481
02:10:29.860 --> 02:10:32.980
It's more like first person shooter mixed with like a role playing,

2482
02:10:33.320 --> 02:10:34.100
but it's one of these

2483
02:10:34.100 --> 02:10:36.500
<v 1>games that if he,
cause he likes grand theft auto.</v>

2484
02:10:36.501 --> 02:10:39.950
It's just an open sandbox meaning there is tons of different endings.

2485
02:10:39.951 --> 02:10:42.620
There's tons of different,
you could either be a good person or a bad guy,

2486
02:10:42.710 --> 02:10:43.191
but what's cool,

2487
02:10:43.191 --> 02:10:46.590
it's just like going into these towns and it's really realistic and you can

2488
02:10:46.950 --> 02:10:51.390
search through people's a mouse and keyboard because everyone,
everyone's used,

2489
02:10:51.480 --> 02:10:54.170
everyone's used to the is accurate.
Yeah.

2490
02:10:54.171 --> 02:10:58.530
But only a certain amount of games like quake does it mean you need to be to

2491
02:10:58.540 --> 02:11:00.240
actually they've actually had um,

2492
02:11:00.560 --> 02:11:04.340
game offs where they're taking people with PC versions of the game and play them

2493
02:11:04.341 --> 02:11:06.860
against people that you have for quick,
not as quick.

2494
02:11:07.640 --> 02:11:10.760
There's only certain mount of games that need to be that accurate.

2495
02:11:10.790 --> 02:11:15.740
Meaning like if you are all playing a battlefield with a controller,
you,

2496
02:11:15.770 --> 02:11:17.450
there's people that are awesome at that,

2497
02:11:17.451 --> 02:11:20.780
but I'm telling you is that you're missing one of the most satisfying parts of

2498
02:11:20.781 --> 02:11:23.330
the game.
His sticks and notice quick,

2499
02:11:23.331 --> 02:11:26.120
I've never pulled the statistics and numbers I'm talking about the most

2500
02:11:26.121 --> 02:11:30.850
satisfying part of these third person shooters is having nasty aim is being able

2501
02:11:30.851 --> 02:11:31.640
to blast dude,

2502
02:11:31.640 --> 02:11:34.400
but they make games so that which came with the controller in mind.

2503
02:11:34.401 --> 02:11:37.790
So you ha you can't have nasty aim playing any of these games,

2504
02:11:37.791 --> 02:11:41.450
but you want to go to the game is playing with a mouse and a keyboard when

2505
02:11:41.451 --> 02:11:43.460
they've played against each other.
The mouse,
the keyboard.

2506
02:11:43.461 --> 02:11:46.730
People always when I have to say because it's more accurate,

2507
02:11:46.731 --> 02:11:49.140
I understand that it's accurate enough,
but you think it's accurate enough.

2508
02:11:49.340 --> 02:11:51.350
But if you were playing against a guy with a mouse and keyboard,

2509
02:11:51.351 --> 02:11:54.230
it's not that you're never playing with a guy with a mouse and a keyboard.

2510
02:11:54.231 --> 02:11:55.640
You're playing other people with controllers.

2511
02:11:55.900 --> 02:11:58.600
Why would you do that if you know a mouse and keyboards more accurate cause you

2512
02:11:58.601 --> 02:11:59.780
get hold.
I'm listen man.

2513
02:11:59.781 --> 02:12:03.770
The whole thing is accuracy and those games the whole time and quake.

2514
02:12:03.890 --> 02:12:05.390
The whole thing is strategy,

2515
02:12:05.660 --> 02:12:08.590
planning out your map and then being able to accurately pick a guy up.

2516
02:12:08.660 --> 02:12:12.190
They designed the game with the controller and accurate at the controllers.

2517
02:12:12.200 --> 02:12:13.550
Limitations in mind.

2518
02:12:13.551 --> 02:12:17.430
So what you might be playing quake where you are so much satisfying.

2519
02:12:17.490 --> 02:12:20.900
You're repeating yourself but I'm saying is it doesn't matter to me because I'll

2520
02:12:20.901 --> 02:12:24.680
always know that the mouse and a keyboard is more accurate for quake.
No,

2521
02:12:24.681 --> 02:12:26.850
anytime it's more accurate.
I know you played them.

2522
02:12:27.200 --> 02:12:30.500
Mouse is a more accurate way of aiming.
I bet.

2523
02:12:30.680 --> 02:12:35.680
I bet if you get like the best battlefield 1943 guy versus the best 1943

2524
02:12:36.930 --> 02:12:38.000
gardener,
a computer,

2525
02:12:38.001 --> 02:12:41.200
I bet there's not going to be a huge difference to to where you can go and spam.

2526
02:12:41.300 --> 02:12:44.510
There's a difference.
The mouse guys always win.
It's,
it's more accurate.
It's,

2527
02:12:44.511 --> 02:12:48.310
it's,
this is not like this.
Not like a an opinion.
This is what it's like.

2528
02:12:49.010 --> 02:12:50.640
It's more like you're,
you're shifting,

2529
02:12:51.280 --> 02:12:54.050
you're shutting off all games on the council because you don't like the

2530
02:12:54.051 --> 02:12:56.700
controller where a game,
why don't want to get addicted to games period.

2531
02:12:57.430 --> 02:13:01.010
Nothing to do with it.
But to me,
if I'm going to play video games,

2532
02:13:01.190 --> 02:13:04.010
I'm going to play the most thrilling ones and the most thrilling ones to me are

2533
02:13:04.011 --> 02:13:08.630
first person shooters,
death match style for quake,
counterstrike,

2534
02:13:08.631 --> 02:13:10.850
Shit like that.
You're running around shooting the mouse and keyboards.

2535
02:13:10.851 --> 02:13:11.840
The only way to go with those tests,

2536
02:13:11.841 --> 02:13:15.150
that's exactly what the death match and grand theft auto and you have all of the

2537
02:13:15.160 --> 02:13:17.630
New York City is your playground and everyone death match.

2538
02:13:17.800 --> 02:13:19.580
But I could be totally down with that though,

2539
02:13:19.581 --> 02:13:22.430
but I would want to be able to get people with like a mouse and keyboard.

2540
02:13:22.430 --> 02:13:25.710
You could snipe people and Shit and perfect Snyder.
I am a,
now he's up to,

2541
02:13:25.720 --> 02:13:29.480
that's what I'm saying.
They're not looking at a level 10 dude,

2542
02:13:30.900 --> 02:13:33.030
you're playing quake.
You don't get opportunities do,

2543
02:13:33.040 --> 02:13:35.170
don't sit around and just wait to be shot in the head.
Right.

2544
02:13:35.400 --> 02:13:38.180
Everybody's constantly moving.
So yeah,
you have to be very active.

2545
02:13:38.190 --> 02:13:40.910
These guys move all the time.
You go to the airport and have the death match.

2546
02:13:40.920 --> 02:13:44.100
Dude,
I go find a nest somewhere and I just let them run and I'll let them,

2547
02:13:44.101 --> 02:13:44.630
I'll eat them.

2548
02:13:44.630 --> 02:13:48.330
We call it and quick they call it camping like rocket jump up too was like

2549
02:13:48.331 --> 02:13:50.070
certain crazy trick moves he can do.

2550
02:13:50.071 --> 02:13:53.100
And one of them was this dude figured out how to double rocket jump right to the

2551
02:13:53.101 --> 02:13:54.060
top of this tower.

2552
02:13:54.180 --> 02:13:57.960
He would throw a grenade down and then he would rocket jump on the grenade.

2553
02:13:57.990 --> 02:14:01.830
Oh that's so he would make sure that the,
the grenade,
he timed the grenade clink,

2554
02:14:01.831 --> 02:14:05.410
clink,
clink and then he would rocket jump.
But it went off to lunch.

2555
02:14:05.411 --> 02:14:07.830
We'll go sailing to the top of this tower was a trick move.

2556
02:14:07.950 --> 02:14:10.140
And then he would just jack people and when the map,

2557
02:14:10.170 --> 02:14:12.630
because you couldn't get them out of there and he would just pick you off of the

2558
02:14:12.631 --> 02:14:16.080
rail or go get this today quick.
I'll fuck you could have got it yesterday.

2559
02:14:16.081 --> 02:14:20.480
It's one,
two,
three,
four.
There's all been out to kill zone to have you played.

2560
02:14:20.790 --> 02:14:22.920
Why do you want,
why do you say you don't want quick?
I want quick.

2561
02:14:23.160 --> 02:14:25.200
I love it because kills don't do as a million times better.

2562
02:14:25.230 --> 02:14:30.000
There's so many games to you but it's having played everything I like.

2563
02:14:30.001 --> 02:14:34.860
I love warfare.
I just love warfare.
If you have where you can use one on one.
Yes.

2564
02:14:35.150 --> 02:14:38.910
The one on one death matches with quake or the most fucking thrilling check and

2565
02:14:38.911 --> 02:14:39.710
everything online.

2566
02:14:39.710 --> 02:14:43.140
I I it's whittled down to one dude online and some before and if it gets real

2567
02:14:43.141 --> 02:14:45.900
exciting you have different tastes than me,
you know,
it's just,
no,
no,

2568
02:14:45.901 --> 02:14:46.920
I'm just saying my taste.

2569
02:14:47.190 --> 02:14:50.220
I'm just saying that they've taken that game and I've made it a million times

2570
02:14:50.221 --> 02:14:54.270
better.
So you're saying you're saying to you killed sounds pretty good.

2571
02:14:54.271 --> 02:14:55.104
That's a ton of games.

2572
02:14:55.790 --> 02:14:59.490
Mouse and keyboard and it's not that you can accurately accuracy.
You can,

2573
02:14:59.640 --> 02:15:04.410
you can get these for Mac is that most of these games are for Mac also a lot of

2574
02:15:04.411 --> 02:15:07.110
the call of duty.
It has a matte caught up Max.
Alright.

2575
02:15:07.420 --> 02:15:10.140
Ea has been pushing it out a little bit better.
What's a good one?

2576
02:15:10.141 --> 02:15:12.450
I can get them all.
Have they all have bootcamps?
I don't have,

2577
02:15:12.720 --> 02:15:15.720
can I get quake for Mac?
Is it getting to a point now though,

2578
02:15:15.721 --> 02:15:18.300
where most games are just going console for the most part?

2579
02:15:18.301 --> 02:15:20.830
I mean they still release him here and there,
but it's not,

2580
02:15:21.220 --> 02:15:23.670
it's they're selling a million times more on constantly.

2581
02:15:24.140 --> 02:15:27.930
Those are becoming just because you can have the best computer and then you get

2582
02:15:27.931 --> 02:15:28.920
that game and it's awesome.

2583
02:15:28.921 --> 02:15:31.350
Next year you're going to have to do something about your computer if you want

2584
02:15:31.351 --> 02:15:33.850
to do as good as a console.
So the console would,

2585
02:15:33.851 --> 02:15:36.690
they've done is they just kind of standardized everything and this is what you

2586
02:15:36.691 --> 02:15:40.200
get and Bam,
you just set it up.
It should be updatable though.
Like sounds,

2587
02:15:40.210 --> 02:15:43.440
I mean are the your computer,
if you're constantly updating a computer,

2588
02:15:43.441 --> 02:15:46.170
that's the problem and then you get a virus or you get something that slows down

2589
02:15:46.171 --> 02:15:48.030
your computer and you're fucked.
Console's,
you know,

2590
02:15:48.031 --> 02:15:50.490
everything's designed for the console like a Mac is,
you know,

2591
02:15:50.491 --> 02:15:52.770
all the programs are designed for Max.
So it definitely,

2592
02:15:52.771 --> 02:15:54.270
it doesn't ever really get slower.

2593
02:15:54.271 --> 02:15:57.890
Your ps three is going to be as fast as the first day you get his last day he

2594
02:15:57.900 --> 02:16:01.770
sees her,
the quake on the way home.
If you already got me into,
I love going.

2595
02:16:01.771 --> 02:16:06.360
So addictive.
Dude.
Are you good at aiming with a mouse and a keyboard?
No,

2596
02:16:06.390 --> 02:16:08.790
but I can get good at it.
I would go online,
man,

2597
02:16:08.791 --> 02:16:11.610
and I would play against dudes for professionals like every now and then due to

2598
02:16:11.611 --> 02:16:15.240
a real professional players of being in these rooms and you go one on one death

2599
02:16:15.241 --> 02:16:17.670
match against these guys and just get raped.

2600
02:16:19.500 --> 02:16:23.330
What kind of control and domination?
So I'm like,
I'm over you.
I always love Oak.

2601
02:16:23.340 --> 02:16:25.770
Exciting.
Your fucking heart is beating a million miles a minute.

2602
02:16:26.180 --> 02:16:29.880
Chasing after you see lightning going right by your head.
Barely miss a you

2603
02:16:30.960 --> 02:16:33.930
<v 3>did.
I love it.
I love it.
I love urban warfare to especially,</v>

2604
02:16:34.030 --> 02:16:36.490
that's the cool thing about grand theft auto.
They have the,
you know,

2605
02:16:36.491 --> 02:16:39.130
you can go to different boroughs in New York and stuff.
And actually if you,

2606
02:16:39.131 --> 02:16:40.730
you can get quick live for free,

2607
02:16:40.731 --> 02:16:45.730
just [inaudible] dot com and you can play for free live.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's a,

2608
02:16:45.731 --> 02:16:49.530
it's a web based program is works for Mac two and each fuck,

2609
02:16:49.590 --> 02:16:53.350
keep me away from it.
So scary man.
Wake,
live and Alon and I'm gaming.

2610
02:16:53.351 --> 02:16:58.330
He's your God damn life Bro.
They're going to get you
the chain gun.

2611
02:16:58.990 --> 02:17:01.720
Oh I love it.
I love it.
I love,

2612
02:17:01.730 --> 02:17:04.030
I was so nasty and death match and the other one,

2613
02:17:04.031 --> 02:17:07.000
it's like I would come up just to piss somebody off.
I'd stab them to death.

2614
02:17:07.210 --> 02:17:10.900
They'd have a gut check of the death.
Brian and I first met,

2615
02:17:10.930 --> 02:17:15.460
we played online once and uh,
this was like in the height of my quake addiction.

2616
02:17:15.910 --> 02:17:18.730
And we only played once just because I just,
yeah,

2617
02:17:18.731 --> 02:17:20.860
he like slammed three he went to,
he won like a hundred,

2618
02:17:20.861 --> 02:17:23.560
two times in a row or something like that.
Cause like I didn't even win.

2619
02:17:23.561 --> 02:17:27.940
But to me to see that.
To me that wasn't even like a fun experience.
I don't,

2620
02:17:27.941 --> 02:17:31.600
well that was because it was unmatched,
pleasant,
quick plane.
Unreal is,

2621
02:17:31.601 --> 02:17:36.490
I played the quakes all my life,
but to me the idea of just run,
run,
run,
kill,

2622
02:17:36.491 --> 02:17:39.340
kill,
die,
run,
run,
run,
kill,
die,
rent.
That's not fun to me.

2623
02:17:39.341 --> 02:17:42.520
It's like I want a little bit more of an adventure I guess mixed in with my

2624
02:17:42.521 --> 02:17:44.320
first person shooter or just,
you know,

2625
02:17:44.350 --> 02:17:48.340
not having to start over from scratch every 30 seconds or a minute,
you know,

2626
02:17:48.400 --> 02:17:51.010
like normally you don't,
you know,
we were just,
it was,

2627
02:17:51.011 --> 02:17:54.940
it was not enjoyable because you stay alive.
I matched,
we were poorly most,

2628
02:17:55.020 --> 02:17:56.950
the thing is I don't like,
I don't like tasks.

2629
02:17:56.951 --> 02:17:58.790
I've never stolen a car and grab them off.

2630
02:17:59.380 --> 02:18:04.330
I don't work for any management people down hallways and lightning gun,

2631
02:18:04.331 --> 02:18:08.500
someone to death.
I'm all about more.
I bring them here to hate walk at lunch.

2632
02:18:08.501 --> 02:18:12.220
You in the face pitch sketchy when you're hitting that bouncy pad,

2633
02:18:12.221 --> 02:18:12.811
jumping through the amp.

2634
02:18:12.811 --> 02:18:17.170
I want to catch you mid jump with a rail gun and watch you explode us pray of

2635
02:18:17.200 --> 02:18:22.060
Red Pixel.
It's wake line.com.
Is that what we're talking about?
So much.
Quake,

2636
02:18:22.061 --> 02:18:26.110
live.com get on and play for free.
So much fun.
Yeah,

2637
02:18:26.111 --> 02:18:29.140
I mean it consumes your life.
Never played it.

2638
02:18:29.141 --> 02:18:33.670
You'll probably like it but I think you're going to be easily like I uh,
no,
no.

2639
02:18:33.671 --> 02:18:35.320
I think you're just going to be easily bored with it.

2640
02:18:35.350 --> 02:18:38.590
You're going to be more one for like the Vegas Vegas or something.

2641
02:18:38.800 --> 02:18:39.551
Why would you say that?

2642
02:18:39.551 --> 02:18:42.730
Why would it be easily bored if you like grand theft auto type games?

2643
02:18:42.750 --> 02:18:46.540
He likes death match match in grand theft auto.
I never do the tasks.

2644
02:18:46.550 --> 02:18:48.640
I've never done any of the test.
Right,
right,
right.
That's what I'm saying.

2645
02:18:48.641 --> 02:18:49.780
But you like the open end rural,

2646
02:18:49.781 --> 02:18:52.580
you're not dying every three seconds and grand theft auto you're collecting.

2647
02:18:52.581 --> 02:18:57.310
You only die every three seconds when you fight
and the death match watch.

2648
02:18:57.340 --> 02:18:59.250
If you watch people in a death match equate,

2649
02:18:59.260 --> 02:19:03.250
people are dying at least once every minute or so.
You're talking.
Okay.

2650
02:19:03.251 --> 02:19:06.640
Once every minute.
Yeah.
But if you're also talking,
are you talking one on one?

2651
02:19:06.650 --> 02:19:07.331
Are you talking about,

2652
02:19:07.331 --> 02:19:11.590
I'm talking about death mat team deathmatch free for all you know,
from,

2653
02:19:11.780 --> 02:19:15.610
if I'm playing a death match in GTA and there's 18 people and that you're dying

2654
02:19:15.611 --> 02:19:18.730
about an average a minute and you're good if you're middle of it.

2655
02:19:18.760 --> 02:19:22.540
And especially for me,
I'm like you,
I get the sniper row collect my weapons.

2656
02:19:22.550 --> 02:19:25.960
I there's like some health she rooms where they only allow like the moderator

2657
02:19:25.961 --> 02:19:28.220
only allele rocket.
So you have to just basically

2658
02:19:28.220 --> 02:19:32.450
<v 1>go around shooting by people.
Right?
Yeah.
So those ones,</v>

2659
02:19:32.690 --> 02:19:35.990
those ones are cool too.
But I like warfare,
like it collecting my weapons and,

2660
02:19:35.991 --> 02:19:39.860
and getting a grenade into tactically leading somebody into which will,

2661
02:19:39.861 --> 02:19:43.430
that's the best thing about the death match and quake is that you control a map

2662
02:19:43.460 --> 02:19:46.580
and that the weapons will respond every 30 seconds.
And that's great.

2663
02:19:46.670 --> 02:19:50.360
You can keep running around snatching up the rock and launches as they respond

2664
02:19:50.660 --> 02:19:52.460
when every time you get them you get like,
you know,

2665
02:19:52.461 --> 02:19:54.320
extra rockets and this guy can't get shit.

2666
02:19:54.321 --> 02:19:56.240
So he's running around with this gay little pistol.
Oh,

2667
02:19:56.241 --> 02:19:59.060
there's only a certain amount of bullets and you're fully loaded with all the

2668
02:19:59.061 --> 02:20:03.170
armor.
Your timing on the armor,
timing,
all the weapon responds.

2669
02:20:03.250 --> 02:20:05.780
You have all your weapons,
all your armor,
and you just raping him.

2670
02:20:05.781 --> 02:20:08.750
Every time he responds.
How is it free?
Where are they making money?

2671
02:20:08.751 --> 02:20:10.700
Can you pull it?
US?
What's an old game?

2672
02:20:10.701 --> 02:20:15.200
Quake has been around for a long time and a quake live is just their way of

2673
02:20:15.201 --> 02:20:18.420
giving back to the community and making people excited about the game and making

2674
02:20:18.421 --> 02:20:23.421
it so that it's a cross platform thing that they can do where it's web based and

2675
02:20:23.511 --> 02:20:27.560
you know,
so they can work on their,
their shit while they develop new games.

2676
02:20:27.561 --> 02:20:30.830
They work on their ability to make them for the web.
Do you still play?

2677
02:20:30.850 --> 02:20:33.620
Are you still playing?
No,
it's scary to me.
Too scary.

2678
02:20:33.621 --> 02:20:34.680
I don't want to lose my life.
Oh,

2679
02:20:34.700 --> 02:20:37.430
I've talked about it so many times in the podcast.
I can't talk about it anymore,

2680
02:20:37.460 --> 02:20:41.790
but I have a real addiction to games.
I get addicted to things.
Um,

2681
02:20:41.990 --> 02:20:43.310
you know what I mean?
We talked about it.

2682
02:20:43.310 --> 02:20:46.730
I think how many comics are like us a lot,
right?
It's a part of it.

2683
02:20:46.731 --> 02:20:47.331
You have to be,

2684
02:20:47.331 --> 02:20:52.331
you have to be a sick fuck to want to go up and make strangers laugh to extract

2685
02:20:53.380 --> 02:20:56.140
an involuntary response for them intermittently.
It's,
it's,

2686
02:20:56.141 --> 02:20:59.570
it's a fucking weird and messed them not laughing and going through them not

2687
02:20:59.571 --> 02:21:03.110
laughing and rebound and try it again.
You should have seen,
I was an Iowa,

2688
02:21:03.111 --> 02:21:06.530
that's plenty funny bone last week and the Friday night they just stared at us

2689
02:21:07.490 --> 02:21:10.880
staring at us and I was like,
Oh my God,
I'm going to be a long,
we can.

2690
02:21:10.881 --> 02:21:14.390
Luckily it was just a different crowd and the rest of the crowds were great.

2691
02:21:14.450 --> 02:21:16.390
So much so.
In fact I was very impressed.
I was like,
Oh,

2692
02:21:16.400 --> 02:21:19.820
you guys are pretty fucking cool people here.
Like they were very,

2693
02:21:20.030 --> 02:21:22.700
this is a lot of cool people all over the country,
all over the Internet.

2694
02:21:23.240 --> 02:21:26.150
Kid kids are cool now.
Just a very cool and like there's not,

2695
02:21:26.180 --> 02:21:28.040
there was no conservative.
There's some,
you know,

2696
02:21:28.070 --> 02:21:29.930
some of the Libertarians which are like,

2697
02:21:29.960 --> 02:21:32.750
I feel bad for real libertarians and one that the tea baggers are starting to

2698
02:21:33.140 --> 02:21:35.390
extract their message,
which are nothing about real.

2699
02:21:35.391 --> 02:21:36.830
Libertarians aren't like that at all.

2700
02:21:37.010 --> 02:21:39.710
But there's some real libertarians out there and some cool guys that talk

2701
02:21:39.711 --> 02:21:42.890
politics and there's some tea baggers in a real libertarians.
Yeah,

2702
02:21:42.891 --> 02:21:44.480
there are as the Ron Paul's of the,

2703
02:21:44.481 --> 02:21:47.330
of the movement and I feel bad that they get lumped in with the wrong one.

2704
02:21:47.350 --> 02:21:50.000
The whole,
you know,
it's,
it's a very,

2705
02:21:50.001 --> 02:21:53.360
very tricky thing when you start getting a giant group together.
Cause it's like,

2706
02:21:53.361 --> 02:21:55.880
okay,
who's in this group?
Okay,
and what are your beliefs?

2707
02:21:56.170 --> 02:21:58.710
But you're calling yourself a tea bag or two,
but you don't like black people.

2708
02:21:58.920 --> 02:22:02.090
Okay.
And you think Obama should go back to Africa and you think he was born in

2709
02:22:02.091 --> 02:22:05.060
Indonesia and you're,
but you're a tea bag or two,
right?
So it's like,

2710
02:22:05.061 --> 02:22:07.700
it gets confusing.
It's like whenever you have a big group,
it's like God damn it.

2711
02:22:07.701 --> 02:22:11.510
Do I have to state what it is to be a t bagger?
Must love everyone.

2712
02:22:11.540 --> 02:22:14.180
You know indiscriminately,
you must do this.
You must do that.

2713
02:22:14.181 --> 02:22:18.410
You must not be a civil war.
Reenactor yeah.
I mean,
Libertarians had,

2714
02:22:18.411 --> 02:22:22.460
there's pretty well mapped out though before they knew exactly what they stood

2715
02:22:22.461 --> 02:22:24.380
for.
No police states,
no funny though.

2716
02:22:24.381 --> 02:22:26.970
That's such a fringe organization and it's thought of as fringe.

2717
02:22:27.410 --> 02:22:30.450
I voted libertarian.
Oh,
you fucking idiot.
And that's it.

2718
02:22:30.451 --> 02:22:33.900
That's the only way to make change.
If somebody finally does something and says,

2719
02:22:33.901 --> 02:22:36.360
fuck this,
fuck voting right or wrong,
or pluck voting,

2720
02:22:36.361 --> 02:22:39.600
I'm voting with how I feel because it's like they were saying when Obama was

2721
02:22:39.601 --> 02:22:42.580
running thing,
I liked Ron Paul a lot.
I really liked and I was like,
Dad,

2722
02:22:42.590 --> 02:22:44.940
I kind of think I want to vote for this guy.
You know?

2723
02:22:44.941 --> 02:22:47.250
I won't say whether I did or didn't it,
but it's like I could really,

2724
02:22:47.730 --> 02:22:50.490
I was more attuned with everything he was saying without a doubt.

2725
02:22:50.491 --> 02:22:53.830
But we've talked about this before,
that they always made him out to be cooks.

2726
02:22:54.040 --> 02:22:57.840
Everyone and Fox News made him out to be a cook.
Everyone on CNN.
I mean,

2727
02:22:57.841 --> 02:22:59.250
that's not an impartial reporting.
That's,

2728
02:22:59.251 --> 02:23:02.520
and even the news and they're doing is they were programming us to think that he

2729
02:23:02.521 --> 02:23:03.630
was a joke candidate.

2730
02:23:03.631 --> 02:23:06.470
That was the really is sad cause when you listen to that man talk,
he,

2731
02:23:06.900 --> 02:23:11.020
he says he makes more sense than anybody.
It's that he's not a politico.

2732
02:23:11.030 --> 02:23:13.620
These are not statements or catch phrases.
He's,

2733
02:23:13.621 --> 02:23:15.720
he'll tell you honestly and it's like,
wow,

2734
02:23:15.780 --> 02:23:18.480
you'll never get an office because nobody will ever have the balls to pull the

2735
02:23:18.481 --> 02:23:20.430
trigger on you.
It's a real wake up call.

2736
02:23:20.431 --> 02:23:23.250
Whenever there's any political campaigning,
whenever you,
uh,

2737
02:23:23.310 --> 02:23:26.910
look at that crazy lady in Arizona.
What is the woman's man,
Bro?
Yeah,

2738
02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:29.030
chamber who uh,

2739
02:23:29.130 --> 02:23:31.920
she made up some crazy shit about her father dying and World War II would be

2740
02:23:31.921 --> 02:23:35.250
wire fraud.
There's a lot there was that.
Now as that Dui,

2741
02:23:35.251 --> 02:23:37.950
things popping up and yeah,
she's fucking crazy.

2742
02:23:38.570 --> 02:23:43.570
No election made up shit about people losing the headless bodies being found on

2743
02:23:44.251 --> 02:23:48.660
the Mexican border and see her phone on her fucking debate.
How she just froze.

2744
02:23:48.661 --> 02:23:52.380
She stopped for 10 seconds.
Is that,
who really does that?

2745
02:23:52.410 --> 02:23:56.010
I wouldn't stop at gunpoint.
Well,
what it was explained to me was that she was,

2746
02:23:56.040 --> 02:23:59.010
she didn't,
wasn't never even elected for that job.
She was given that job.
Well,

2747
02:23:59.011 --> 02:24:01.860
when the Paula Tonto laughs,
she was lieutenant governor and she was,

2748
02:24:02.100 --> 02:24:03.720
and you know what,
they will elect her today.

2749
02:24:03.810 --> 02:24:06.780
You think so that's my old hometown man.
Um,
I,
I love,

2750
02:24:07.200 --> 02:24:10.280
I love my people there and I love springtime and Arizona,
but there's some,

2751
02:24:10.630 --> 02:24:13.530
some politically backwards.
It's gotten more backwards since I've left.

2752
02:24:13.560 --> 02:24:15.840
They was pretty cool in the 90s,
five Simonton was governor,

2753
02:24:15.841 --> 02:24:20.160
but we were in a club in Phoenix and Brian sent me hip to a,

2754
02:24:20.161 --> 02:24:24.990
one of the major problems in Phoenix.
Do you remember that?
A long time ago.
Many,

2755
02:24:24.991 --> 02:24:29.570
many years ago.
Cane Vampires.
Oh yeah.
We were in this club and a,

2756
02:24:29.580 --> 02:24:34.360
I had never done coke before.
And Brian goes,
everyone's on coke.
It's like,
well,

2757
02:24:34.361 --> 02:24:37.710
what are you talking about?
Everyone?
Everyone hears on coke.
Can I go?
Okay,
okay,

2758
02:24:38.250 --> 02:24:40.560
tell me how,
you know they're on coke?
And he goes,
watch.
He goes,

2759
02:24:40.561 --> 02:24:42.510
you're gonna look around.
I'm don't look at,
you're going to look around.

2760
02:24:42.511 --> 02:24:44.940
Everyone's going to be touching her nose and they're all going to be talking and

2761
02:24:44.941 --> 02:24:47.310
they're all going to be very excited and it's going to be like a lot of fist

2762
02:24:47.311 --> 02:24:49.290
pumps and a lot of fucking high fives.

2763
02:24:50.340 --> 02:24:53.520
Just look around and all of a sudden I looked around and he was like the
opening,

2764
02:24:54.410 --> 02:24:57.580
like the opening scene in blade with a bloods tied sprang from the ceiling.

2765
02:24:57.610 --> 02:25:01.680
The guys,
he was like,
what the hell man,

2766
02:25:01.860 --> 02:25:04.800
that's so true because it's too hot there in the day and they stay in the clubs

2767
02:25:04.801 --> 02:25:09.210
all night.
It's just a,
it's a very strange thing and it happened in the old west,

2768
02:25:09.211 --> 02:25:10.150
even in Wyatt Earp stay.

2769
02:25:10.151 --> 02:25:14.100
There's just always been this strange outlaw rogue mentality there.

2770
02:25:15.260 --> 02:25:18.600
Here's a problem with Phoenix.
I Love Phoenix.
I love going back there.

2771
02:25:18.990 --> 02:25:21.030
The problem with that places,
it gets too hot,

2772
02:25:21.230 --> 02:25:24.220
120 a to eight so hot and people stop

2773
02:25:24.220 --> 02:25:26.170
<v 3>thinking when it gets that high and it really isn't.</v>

2774
02:25:26.171 --> 02:25:27.100
It's something where it's like,
you know,

2775
02:25:27.101 --> 02:25:29.350
I haven't lived there in 10 11 years and I could never,

2776
02:25:29.351 --> 02:25:31.540
I don't know how I lived in it.
I don't know how I did it.

2777
02:25:31.570 --> 02:25:35.470
I don't have the extreme heat brings like a lack of days,
sick mentality.

2778
02:25:36.060 --> 02:25:38.280
You lackadaisical or you're like,
oh yeah,

2779
02:25:38.740 --> 02:25:40.620
you don't want to do anything you like fuck.

2780
02:25:40.780 --> 02:25:44.990
Just hopscotch from air conditioner to air conditioning.
Literally what you see,

2781
02:25:45.020 --> 02:25:49.690
not good.
I'd rather have,
I'd rather have Chili.
I'd rather that 30 days.
Yeah.

2782
02:25:49.700 --> 02:25:54.280
I would rather have 30 degrees like Colorado.
It's like 75 degrees every day.

2783
02:25:54.550 --> 02:25:58.450
It gets hot out here in the valley.
It gets hot.
It gets,
it gets,
it's awesome.

2784
02:25:58.451 --> 02:26:00.850
In Malibu.
Yeah.
When you look by the or by the ocean.

2785
02:26:00.851 --> 02:26:04.090
Santa Monica Marine layer because it's never hot.
It's never cold.

2786
02:26:04.091 --> 02:26:05.590
It's always like 70 something degrees.

2787
02:26:05.760 --> 02:26:07.800
You can always wear shorts and November if you will.

2788
02:26:07.801 --> 02:26:09.310
That's what's good about the marine layer.
It keeps,

2789
02:26:09.311 --> 02:26:12.820
it keeps the heat out and keeps the cool end when it needs to and go till a big

2790
02:26:12.821 --> 02:26:17.500
rock from the sky hits that bitch and the water comes out thousand miles high

2791
02:26:17.501 --> 02:26:21.790
towards the rocks and I'll be up there.
Looting son,
will you be?
Yeah,

2792
02:26:21.791 --> 02:26:22.600
I'll be out there.
Looting.

2793
02:26:22.600 --> 02:26:25.060
We'd go looting at the first sign of anything going wrong.

2794
02:26:26.410 --> 02:26:29.170
Would you put a mask on or do you think you would just fuck it?

2795
02:26:29.260 --> 02:26:31.500
Risk those youtube videos?
I think I,
you know,

2796
02:26:31.510 --> 02:26:35.320
I would do is just go completely like a lord of the flies.

2797
02:26:35.321 --> 02:26:40.180
I could get a crazy haircut,
just do everything.
One eyebrow maybe off,
you know,

2798
02:26:40.240 --> 02:26:43.840
whatever style.
Yeah.
Do you ever worry about that?
About the end of the society?

2799
02:26:43.841 --> 02:26:47.620
About everything falling apart?
I don't worry about it.
I think about it.

2800
02:26:47.830 --> 02:26:51.070
Like I said earlier,
I think it's a,
if I was part of the last generation,

2801
02:26:51.071 --> 02:26:55.010
that'd be a kind of a cool thing.
You know?
It would be,
it's like,
Eh,
yeah,

2802
02:26:55.030 --> 02:26:57.100
this generation.
What about that last generation?

2803
02:26:57.101 --> 02:27:00.280
That's some cool shit that we're all dying and it won't matter because there'll

2804
02:27:00.281 --> 02:27:03.700
be no one to tell the story too,
but you know what I exactly,
but there's no,

2805
02:27:04.600 --> 02:27:08.290
there's no Kaboom.
There's no we end all at once.
I think the idea is just like,

2806
02:27:08.500 --> 02:27:09.820
you know how it's happened before.

2807
02:27:09.821 --> 02:27:13.120
It's something real bad will happen and then people will die out and replenish

2808
02:27:13.121 --> 02:27:15.880
after a while,
but it'll just be shitty times,
you know?

2809
02:27:15.881 --> 02:27:18.490
Like even if nuclear war happens all over the world,

2810
02:27:18.730 --> 02:27:21.220
too good right now with refrigerators and cell phones.

2811
02:27:21.220 --> 02:27:24.820
We've got it wired and you go to a supermarket,
it's getting fat.
Steak,

2812
02:27:25.080 --> 02:27:29.690
pick up some fucking charcoal,
come home light that bitch kickback.

2813
02:27:29.740 --> 02:27:34.360
Watch a little of the fucking high def TV,
watch some HD net fights and shit.

2814
02:27:34.361 --> 02:27:38.600
How about cold beer?
I think or it's just getting better and better.
Ooh,

2815
02:27:38.740 --> 02:27:41.170
it's the greatest time to be alive ever.
It really is.

2816
02:27:41.171 --> 02:27:43.670
And every day you can say that.
And so when people say like to like go,

2817
02:27:43.671 --> 02:27:47.020
we'll bring kids into this world.
It's like shut up faggot.
Good.
Exactly.

2818
02:27:47.021 --> 02:27:49.730
Shut your mouth.
Would you rather bring them in the fucking King Arthur data?

2819
02:27:50.080 --> 02:27:55.010
Daya smallpox or stupid coach in fucking Pete and it would sticks.

2820
02:27:55.030 --> 02:27:58.720
Enlightened on fire plan is the best time to have people absolute best time.

2821
02:27:58.900 --> 02:28:03.050
And speaking of which I'm not,
speaking of which,
where are you a at next?

2822
02:28:03.070 --> 02:28:04.630
What are you doing?
Stand up.
Uh,

2823
02:28:04.631 --> 02:28:07.840
I'll be in comedy store locally here in La this week.

2824
02:28:07.841 --> 02:28:10.720
Then I'm going to be headlining in La Jolla.
What time where your spots?

2825
02:28:10.721 --> 02:28:12.220
Because you know the comedy store?
Uh,

2826
02:28:12.320 --> 02:28:17.140
I'm usually on at 10:00 PM 10:00 PM 10 45.
There's some times to avoid it.

2827
02:28:17.141 --> 02:28:19.750
That motherfucker.
Yeah,
there certainly is.
It's a,
you know,

2828
02:28:19.790 --> 02:28:22.730
the from nine o'clock until midnight.
It's,
it's pretty good.

2829
02:28:22.760 --> 02:28:25.760
How are you guys getting good crowds down there?
Yeah.
Real good crabs.

2830
02:28:25.761 --> 02:28:28.400
We've joined the 21st century thanks to Alpha Lamont.
We're on,

2831
02:28:28.460 --> 02:28:32.030
we're on the line now.
It's cool.
It's real cool.
Contacted me on Twitter.

2832
02:28:32.031 --> 02:28:33.070
I've gone back and forth with him.

2833
02:28:33.280 --> 02:28:35.690
He seems like he's a dedicated to the idea of the store.

2834
02:28:36.170 --> 02:28:38.960
The store always needs and need someone to come along the believes in the whole

2835
02:28:38.961 --> 02:28:42.350
message of it.
Sure.
And and,
and there really isn't a whole lot to do.
It's,

2836
02:28:42.410 --> 02:28:47.320
he's on it.
Yeah.
It's looking at Bethany and then Christmas vacation.
Oh,

2837
02:28:47.720 --> 02:28:49.520
it's a house on fire clock.

2838
02:28:50.030 --> 02:28:52.730
Tough battle to how many comic conversations do you have with Tommy and

2839
02:28:52.731 --> 02:28:55.820
irregular?
Oh Dude.
It's really,

2840
02:28:55.821 --> 02:28:59.550
since that's the most ridiculous shit he's ever said to you.
Um,
well,

2841
02:29:00.650 --> 02:29:03.760
uh,
my favorite thing about it is there is,

2842
02:29:03.890 --> 02:29:06.860
it's not even like people just like said race racist,
not really racist.

2843
02:29:06.861 --> 02:29:10.700
He just believe some crazy shit.
Like,

2844
02:29:10.800 --> 02:29:13.160
like if somebody does something to be like,
oh that's cause they're German,

2845
02:29:13.161 --> 02:29:17.000
I'd be like,
I know it's cause they're Protestant.
It's like,

2846
02:29:17.001 --> 02:29:19.310
well how do you even know?
You know,

2847
02:29:19.311 --> 02:29:23.330
it's just like he's a very interesting character.
Him and Giannis Zap,
you know,

2848
02:29:23.331 --> 02:29:26.330
there's characters up there that you'll never forget it as long as you live.

2849
02:29:26.620 --> 02:29:29.900
Shine is a magnet for crazy people.
It really is.
And it's just like,
it's like,

2850
02:29:29.910 --> 02:29:31.910
it's like a beacon for them on the sunset strip.

2851
02:29:31.910 --> 02:29:34.540
They wouldn't ever try to walk into another business.
No,

2852
02:29:34.600 --> 02:29:37.970
that wouldn't walk into the Andaz next door.
They want to try that at the house.

2853
02:29:37.971 --> 02:29:39.450
A place they come right to the store.

2854
02:29:39.451 --> 02:29:42.860
It's a magnet and they know they can go to the very back and come out without

2855
02:29:42.861 --> 02:29:44.020
being hassled.
They can go,

2856
02:29:44.090 --> 02:29:47.660
they know probably map provides you a fucking plastic bags popping out of his

2857
02:29:47.661 --> 02:29:48.860
clothes.
You see him hanging out there.

2858
02:29:49.010 --> 02:29:52.460
He insulates his body with plastic bags cause you gotta walk like 10 miles to

2859
02:29:52.461 --> 02:29:56.420
get to the stuff that I saw him like last week.
And I was talking,

2860
02:29:56.480 --> 02:29:59.630
he was talking to Tommy and I was like,
I just went to go like,
hey good.

2861
02:29:59.631 --> 02:30:03.090
You can't touch them.
You're all freaked out.

2862
02:30:03.310 --> 02:30:06.980
He'll start Yiping like a dog.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
He's nuts.

2863
02:30:07.160 --> 02:30:11.810
He played basketball at Ucla.
Yeah,
I heard he was quite brilliant.

2864
02:30:11.900 --> 02:30:14.000
Real everybody's this brilliant.
I mean I shouldn't,

2865
02:30:14.330 --> 02:30:18.920
he may have some sorts of brilliant dude and he's now he's living like downtown.

2866
02:30:18.921 --> 02:30:21.500
And then what?
How Tandra hotel.
He just went nuts.

2867
02:30:21.501 --> 02:30:24.410
It's like he schizophrenia got them.
Cause you can tell,

2868
02:30:24.411 --> 02:30:26.120
you can have a conversation with them.

2869
02:30:26.121 --> 02:30:30.470
I have Brian was just talking about another girl that we know that went nuts.
No,

2870
02:30:31.760 --> 02:30:33.960
because that's not,
it's personal.
But I,
you know,
I,

2871
02:30:34.010 --> 02:30:37.430
I think it's weird how like if you look at comics and journal,

2872
02:30:37.431 --> 02:30:41.030
there's a big part of these comics that uh,
you know,

2873
02:30:41.031 --> 02:30:44.450
they do end up losing their minds.
They do end up,
you know,

2874
02:30:44.480 --> 02:30:47.450
going through huge things that depression and you know,

2875
02:30:47.840 --> 02:30:51.080
getting into hardcore drug.
It's a crazy ride man.

2876
02:30:51.081 --> 02:30:56.081
The ride of needing to constantly be up and on that stage and constantly be

2877
02:30:56.360 --> 02:30:58.580
pumping it out and turning it on for people.

2878
02:30:58.970 --> 02:31:02.990
It's a very delicate balance and you have to balance out your ego with your

2879
02:31:02.991 --> 02:31:03.980
imagination,

2880
02:31:03.981 --> 02:31:07.970
with your desire to please people with your desire to make yourself look.
I mean,

2881
02:31:07.971 --> 02:31:10.850
you have to figure out what the fuck you're doing this for,
why you're doing it.

2882
02:31:11.060 --> 02:31:14.990
You have to figure out why bits aren't working and got to figure out why they're

2883
02:31:14.991 --> 02:31:17.700
not liking you.
There's a lot of shit going on.
It's a,

2884
02:31:17.990 --> 02:31:20.010
it's a lot of stress for a lot of people and some

2885
02:31:20.010 --> 02:31:21.460
<v 1>of them just can't handle it after awhile.</v>

2886
02:31:21.590 --> 02:31:23.520
Like did the very need for it in the first place.

2887
02:31:23.521 --> 02:31:27.120
Usually it usually signifies something went wrong in their childhood.
Oh,

2888
02:31:27.121 --> 02:31:29.760
absolutely.
I what that,
yeah,
I would say that that the,
you know,

2889
02:31:29.761 --> 02:31:32.290
Mine Dad didn't play ball with me.
That's why I'm a comedian.
Yeah.

2890
02:31:32.370 --> 02:31:36.000
That's exactly why I need the attention of people.
You know,
everybody,
right.

2891
02:31:36.001 --> 02:31:38.960
All of us.
And if you ever met anybody that's any good that isn't like that.
Yeah.

2892
02:31:38.970 --> 02:31:41.430
Or that had a great upbringing and childhood was great.

2893
02:31:41.440 --> 02:31:45.870
And it's one of the reasons why,
you know,
we can identify with each other.

2894
02:31:46.050 --> 02:31:47.790
It's one of the reasons why we,

2895
02:31:47.820 --> 02:31:51.360
we appreciate each other and respect each other in a way that,
like,

2896
02:31:51.361 --> 02:31:53.880
even when I was talking about Mark Marin earlier,
I liked mark.

2897
02:31:53.881 --> 02:31:57.750
I don't know how to sharpen with mark,
but if I saw mark in like Germany,

2898
02:31:57.930 --> 02:32:01.560
if I was like going to the airport and Germany and all of sudden I ran into
mark,

2899
02:32:01.590 --> 02:32:04.330
I'd be like genuinely happy to see him.
Right.
You know,
I'd be like,
well,

2900
02:32:04.470 --> 02:32:08.040
somebody of your ill now he's the of my,
he's like one of me.

2901
02:32:08.270 --> 02:32:10.560
You know what I mean?
We might be different,
but it's we're,

2902
02:32:10.561 --> 02:32:14.760
we're both comics like there might be a thousand of us in the whole country for

2903
02:32:14.761 --> 02:32:17.400
real.
I mean if you look at all the comedians in this country,

2904
02:32:17.401 --> 02:32:21.240
all the professional communities,
there's 300 million plus people and Mexicans.

2905
02:32:21.450 --> 02:32:21.751
Okay,

2906
02:32:21.751 --> 02:32:26.130
so who knows how many of that really is 300 million plus people and out of the

2907
02:32:26.131 --> 02:32:29.370
may be a thousand of them are professional comedians have that thousand

2908
02:32:29.371 --> 02:32:32.340
comedians.
Maybe.
How many are headliners?

2909
02:32:32.370 --> 02:32:36.730
Are there 300 or 500 is there even is or even that many?
It is a,

2910
02:32:36.731 --> 02:32:39.420
it's a very exclusive group.
It's a nutty number,
man.

2911
02:32:39.421 --> 02:32:42.670
500 people were just throwing that out off the top of my head,

2912
02:32:42.671 --> 02:32:43.890
but I think it's probably pretty accurate.

2913
02:32:43.920 --> 02:32:46.620
You're probably dead right about that because we live in comedy cities.

2914
02:32:46.621 --> 02:32:49.810
It's like,
yeah,
you know when people meet a comedian outside of la or something,

2915
02:32:50.040 --> 02:32:51.810
it's like meeting an astronaut to them.
They're just,

2916
02:32:51.840 --> 02:32:56.220
they don't know what it's about.
Totally.
The comedy community in Indianapolis,

2917
02:32:56.221 --> 02:32:59.190
when I was in Indianapolis,
I'll show some dudes are like local comics there.

2918
02:32:59.490 --> 02:33:00.360
It's nice to see.

2919
02:33:00.361 --> 02:33:03.600
It's nice to know that there's like a little amateur community and they've got

2920
02:33:03.660 --> 02:33:06.140
Google it.
Well,
she do around here.
Oh,
there's a bar that does comedy.

2921
02:33:06.141 --> 02:33:09.310
A Tuesday night.
There's this place and this guy runs a room,
you know,

2922
02:33:09.330 --> 02:33:12.450
they're trying to develop some little comedy community.
I've got to go to Iowa,

2923
02:33:12.451 --> 02:33:15.150
has it to,
when I was there,
they had a little community to go and he's like,

2924
02:33:15.151 --> 02:33:17.960
you got any advice?
Like go get the fuck out of Iowa.
We had a home,

2925
02:33:18.100 --> 02:33:21.360
but it's not bad to start out in a price suck.
It's not bad.
And you know what?

2926
02:33:21.361 --> 02:33:24.030
The Midwest,
they have some great clubs,
some funny bones there.

2927
02:33:24.031 --> 02:33:27.030
They're always good and I always feel the need to support those clubs too.

2928
02:33:27.031 --> 02:33:28.320
I'm coming back and do those clubs.

2929
02:33:28.520 --> 02:33:33.420
I tried to do all the cool little clubs like I love going back and doing the

2930
02:33:33.421 --> 02:33:36.340
punchline.
Atlanta,
you would do a punchline Atlanta.
Oh,

2931
02:33:36.420 --> 02:33:40.470
it's a fucking beautiful club.
Perfect size.
Got Wood paneling,

2932
02:33:40.800 --> 02:33:44.640
ancient photographs.
I mean it hasn't changed.
The underground.

2933
02:33:44.760 --> 02:33:48.060
Brian went up during a fucking UFC night.

2934
02:33:48.061 --> 02:33:52.140
He hadn't done comedy in years.
Okay.
And we were smoking weed and we were drunk.

2935
02:33:52.290 --> 02:33:55.920
And uh,
like you want to do some comedy tonight?
It's like,
Oh,
what tonight?

2936
02:33:56.070 --> 02:33:58.590
So nitrogen is fucking crowd.
Come on dudes.

2937
02:33:58.591 --> 02:34:00.400
She would just get up there and do it.
He goes,
all right,
let me,

2938
02:34:00.630 --> 02:34:01.800
let me try to remember my stuff.

2939
02:34:02.470 --> 02:34:05.220
He hasn't done comedy like how long have you been doing comedy for?

2940
02:34:05.250 --> 02:34:09.610
Years for you nearly did it like 10 times before that bid night.

2941
02:34:09.690 --> 02:34:11.910
UFC crowd a punchline.
Atlanta.

2942
02:34:11.911 --> 02:34:16.911
But that's how good the punchline is that a mid might fucking crowd on a UFC

2943
02:34:17.621 --> 02:34:21.310
night where there was just savages in the audience and he could still go on and

2944
02:34:21.311 --> 02:34:24.670
kill.
Oh that's great.
You're so fucking classic club.

2945
02:34:24.700 --> 02:34:28.780
Perfect size owners to great.
I like how they have like this little balcony.

2946
02:34:29.220 --> 02:34:33.130
The comedy works in Denver.
That's another one.
Yeah.
Fucking epic place.

2947
02:34:33.290 --> 02:34:37.610
Epic Little Club.
This weekend I'm doing the Cap City Comedy Club in uh,
in,

2948
02:34:37.611 --> 02:34:41.090
in Austin.
Do you ever do that?
Oh,

2949
02:34:43.170 --> 02:34:47.470
oh,
that's debit card.
That's clubs ever.
God,
this place is,

2950
02:34:47.620 --> 02:34:52.030
in my opinion,
the,
the most exciting place to perform in the whole country.

2951
02:34:52.300 --> 02:34:56.380
There's something about Austin and this cap city has been around forever and

2952
02:34:56.381 --> 02:34:58.690
there's like so many cool motherfuckers in Austin.

2953
02:34:58.691 --> 02:35:01.540
They get excited when cool people,
I love the arts in Austin.

2954
02:35:01.980 --> 02:35:03.250
Big Supporters of the arts.

2955
02:35:03.490 --> 02:35:08.140
Super appreciate good comedy too because Hicks had like a big base in Austin.

2956
02:35:08.560 --> 02:35:13.560
There's a lot of really good local comics and authentic it really smart artists.

2957
02:35:13.800 --> 02:35:15.820
They have a seen sixth street and all that.

2958
02:35:15.821 --> 02:35:19.660
They definitely have a kickass seen there.
Do you do a cap city?
You ever do that?

2959
02:35:19.690 --> 02:35:20.940
No.
Oh

2960
02:35:21.740 --> 02:35:24.910
<v 3>son,
you gotta go.
They gotta uh,
um,
you know,</v>

2961
02:35:24.950 --> 02:35:27.040
locally it's like obviously the store.

2962
02:35:27.050 --> 02:35:29.090
Are you ever going to come back to this store?
You know,
you're,

2963
02:35:29.150 --> 02:35:32.080
you're a man of your word.
I'll say you value one it,

2964
02:35:32.720 --> 02:35:36.850
I'll say you're never coming back to Ciro's.
Huh?
Cock suck.
I'd been there before.

2965
02:35:36.950 --> 02:35:39.070
<v 1>Been there,
done that moon on.
Sure.</v>

2966
02:35:40.050 --> 02:35:44.180
It would be in a front.
It would be a travesty.
It would be.

2967
02:35:44.360 --> 02:35:48.440
I could not do it.
They did everything that does not stand for comedy.

2968
02:35:48.650 --> 02:35:52.580
They stood for everything that they should have been fighting against.

2969
02:35:52.790 --> 02:35:55.310
They embraced the hackery,
the sh not just that,

2970
02:35:55.311 --> 02:35:57.950
the fact that I fucking work for those assholes for free.

2971
02:35:58.160 --> 02:36:01.370
My name was on the marquee every weekend I promoted on my myspace page.

2972
02:36:02.280 --> 02:36:04.680
<v 3>You're the only reason I could leave my shirt not inside out.</v>

2973
02:36:04.920 --> 02:36:06.030
Like when I worked the booth there,

2974
02:36:06.031 --> 02:36:08.130
I was so fucking embarrassed about that lineup.

2975
02:36:08.430 --> 02:36:12.000
Like you are the only saving grace and dare I even say Eddie Griffin,
if he's,

2976
02:36:12.030 --> 02:36:13.920
if he was in town,
some dark,
dark.

2977
02:36:14.380 --> 02:36:18.630
So there was a girl who would eat the Matzah,
no drums and there was,

2978
02:36:19.020 --> 02:36:20.880
there was the dingle and the,

2979
02:36:21.030 --> 02:36:26.030
there's so many people there that didn't work anywhere else and Mitzi gave him a

2980
02:36:26.191 --> 02:36:29.400
a fucking Friday,
Saturday night spots in the prime.

2981
02:36:29.401 --> 02:36:31.950
It like people would come up and be like,
do you work here?
Be like,
no,

2982
02:36:32.090 --> 02:36:35.360
you know I don't.
We had rented Zz nine.
He said the exact same thing.

2983
02:36:35.820 --> 02:36:39.230
Embarrassing.
It's like you're just like,
please job with Joe on put Joanna.

2984
02:36:39.240 --> 02:36:42.000
I would lie to like guys like guys would come up and be like,
am I on?
I was like,

2985
02:36:42.001 --> 02:36:45.630
no,
you're not all actually Mitzi called.
We've got to put your on now.
You know,

2986
02:36:45.631 --> 02:36:48.990
it was just like it,
it was just so bad.
And we would pay.

2987
02:36:48.991 --> 02:36:51.930
I look people in the face and tell him what was it like 10 bucks at the time.

2988
02:36:52.410 --> 02:36:54.210
But I'd make them come in there and pay and they'd be like,

2989
02:36:54.211 --> 02:36:56.660
when does the comedy going to start now I'll give him the credit.

2990
02:36:56.670 --> 02:37:01.420
It's young guys.
It's relevant people.
You've got some upcoming guys come comps.

2991
02:37:01.570 --> 02:37:04.680
There's AL,
there's,
there's,
you know Steve Byrne.
There's a lottery.

2992
02:37:04.890 --> 02:37:05.581
There's already,

2993
02:37:05.581 --> 02:37:09.840
there's a lot of guys who I would say you're getting a good show and there's

2994
02:37:09.841 --> 02:37:12.600
this new crop of guys who,
Bobby Lee and I were talking about this.

2995
02:37:12.601 --> 02:37:16.010
They don't quite mind their p's and q's all the time.
They don't the hierarchy

2996
02:37:16.010 --> 02:37:19.040
<v 1>there that you're not even allowed to look at me.
You know what I mean?</v>

2997
02:37:19.700 --> 02:37:21.840
Cause it gets,
Bobby gets real bent out of shape about that.
He's like,

2998
02:37:22.070 --> 02:37:25.900
the new guy.
I fucking hate that fucking guy.
He fucking looked at me.
I was like,

2999
02:37:26.570 --> 02:37:30.470
what?
Like to like have a hierarchy,
you know?
Yeah.
He was serious.
He was pissed.

3000
02:37:30.471 --> 02:37:32.120
He's like,
you guys did a lot of fucking talk to me.

3001
02:37:33.400 --> 02:37:36.650
I was laughing about it cause this disguise the nicest guy in the world that

3002
02:37:36.651 --> 02:37:39.320
he's talking about.
Everybody likes this.
New Comics get like that,
man.

3003
02:37:39.321 --> 02:37:41.690
I had a lot of comics when I was coming up that had been around before.

3004
02:37:41.691 --> 02:37:43.940
That would give you like advice and like a Saul.
Yeah.

3005
02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:46.430
When you get to fucking get two years in the business,

3006
02:37:46.670 --> 02:37:50.180
then tell me what you think's funny.
Okay,
kid.
Right,
right.
Well meanwhile dude,

3007
02:37:50.181 --> 02:37:53.180
you suck.
How about that?
Yeah.
How about you never going to be funny.
Yeah.

3008
02:37:53.181 --> 02:37:55.310
That's the thing too.
I used to hate,
I remember when I started there,

3009
02:37:55.311 --> 02:38:00.311
there was these like Frankie pace was still fitter fit or fitter.

3010
02:38:00.921 --> 02:38:05.570
Frankie pace face.
He was angry at everybody.
Look at this guy,

3011
02:38:05.571 --> 02:38:09.390
he's got a fucking deal.
He's on TV.
What about,
you know,

3012
02:38:09.410 --> 02:38:12.110
who's doing that now is Kravitz and he's always around.

3013
02:38:12.430 --> 02:38:15.040
I heard he took a long time off and then just started,

3014
02:38:15.041 --> 02:38:17.630
got coming back to how many friends coming back and we were always friendly with

3015
02:38:17.631 --> 02:38:19.760
each other.
I still am friendly with them,
but he's just a bitter,

3016
02:38:19.761 --> 02:38:23.930
bitter guy and that's a real bad thing in comedy.
So worse,
I've noticed,
you know,

3017
02:38:23.960 --> 02:38:27.500
I sell them shit on other comics because one,
I'm not watching them and two,

3018
02:38:27.501 --> 02:38:30.590
I don't care.
It's like,
the thing is,
it's like the Carlos,
I need to be addressed.

3019
02:38:30.590 --> 02:38:32.690
People shit on Dane Cook.
He's never taken anything from me.

3020
02:38:32.930 --> 02:38:36.590
It's not a bad person.
He's not taking anything from pain did.

3021
02:38:36.680 --> 02:38:40.760
He'd made some unfortunate choices and he's a super ambitious guy and he's a,

3022
02:38:40.770 --> 02:38:44.660
you know,
that's what I tell people.
So powerful motivated dude.
It's no,

3023
02:38:45.140 --> 02:38:47.380
he is who he is.
It's like people would be like,
like,

3024
02:38:47.390 --> 02:38:50.060
I'll meet these guys as young open.
Mike was like,
screw Dane Cook.
I'm like,

3025
02:38:50.360 --> 02:38:55.360
I was here 10 years ago when that guy was grinding and I've never met a comedian

3026
02:38:57.231 --> 02:38:59.870
who worked at hard.
Do you have to like us county?
No,
I don't like it.

3027
02:39:00.080 --> 02:39:02.370
But is he a comedian?
Yeah,
he's a [inaudible].

3028
02:39:02.600 --> 02:39:05.210
The difference between him and steal you was so evident.

3029
02:39:05.240 --> 02:39:08.720
It was a different slide that was pointed out too because like even like I think

3030
02:39:08.721 --> 02:39:10.400
when he was on your show he was like,
look,

3031
02:39:10.401 --> 02:39:13.430
I am not him and I not deserve to be put in that he does it.

3032
02:39:13.430 --> 02:39:16.640
He does not deserve to be put into that.
No,
not even remotely.
Not even close.

3033
02:39:17.220 --> 02:39:21.050
What happened with men steal your two was this crazy thing where he would go on

3034
02:39:21.051 --> 02:39:22.790
in front of guys and do their material.

3035
02:39:23.030 --> 02:39:26.420
Do you remember when he did that local thing and he went in front of Johnny

3036
02:39:26.420 --> 02:39:27.290
Sanchez and he did?
Yeah,

3037
02:39:27.350 --> 02:39:30.590
he did like his closing bit before he brought him up and he would do that to

3038
02:39:30.591 --> 02:39:31.910
people all the time.

3039
02:39:31.911 --> 02:39:35.480
It would just gang shit and do it in front of you and it was like an in your

3040
02:39:35.481 --> 02:39:38.540
face.
Look what I just got away with.
It was like some sort of like,

3041
02:39:38.840 --> 02:39:42.890
like Badass thing.
Yeah,
it's a very mind fuck thing.

3042
02:39:42.891 --> 02:39:45.470
I remember Marin pointed it out.
He said like,
you know,

3043
02:39:45.471 --> 02:39:48.970
tell me about your first comedy experience.
I went and bought a book jokes.

3044
02:39:48.970 --> 02:39:50.980
He said,
and then I went and told American thing.

3045
02:39:51.050 --> 02:39:53.450
That was the most disappointing thing is one of the reasons why.
I mean,

3046
02:39:53.540 --> 02:39:55.340
like I said,
I don't hate Marin and he's a good guy.

3047
02:39:55.520 --> 02:39:58.850
He's trying to do the right thing with his life,
but he said about this,

3048
02:39:58.851 --> 02:40:02.960
men see a thing that me and him on stage was to bullies,
arguing over bullshit.

3049
02:40:03.500 --> 02:40:04.160
I'm like,
man,

3050
02:40:04.160 --> 02:40:07.760
you know that's not fair because I didn't want this to happen and the only

3051
02:40:07.761 --> 02:40:10.940
reason it happened in the first place get more on called me up on stage.

3052
02:40:10.941 --> 02:40:14.040
He actually gone on stage,
took the microphone,
called her up on stage,

3053
02:40:14.390 --> 02:40:15.031
got on stage,

3054
02:40:15.031 --> 02:40:18.090
took it from a guy who was on stage who I brought up and so I was like,
look,

3055
02:40:18.091 --> 02:40:20.880
if you want to do this,
I'll do this.
Like,
I'm not scared of you.

3056
02:40:21.140 --> 02:40:23.370
Like if you want to call me out in front of a room full of people that I just

3057
02:40:23.371 --> 02:40:26.700
performed for and you want to continue this.
Okay,
if you have the microphone,

3058
02:40:26.730 --> 02:40:29.820
okay,
you don't deserve to have the,
when you're not even supposed to be on stage,

3059
02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:32.370
but if you want to do that and you've just hijacked the show,

3060
02:40:32.371 --> 02:40:34.230
I'll go up there and we'll figure out where this goes.

3061
02:40:34.320 --> 02:40:37.710
And that's what it was to me.
If it wasn't for Brian and Brian's editing skills,

3062
02:40:37.711 --> 02:40:40.740
I mean it would've never even hit the air.
I didn't even know he was in the room.

3063
02:40:40.741 --> 02:40:44.190
And you know,
it's crazy is before that even happened,

3064
02:40:44.320 --> 02:40:48.590
he knew who I was and hated me because I had earlier made this other Carlos and

3065
02:40:48.591 --> 02:40:51.150
see a video that was like not successful at all.

3066
02:40:51.360 --> 02:40:54.560
But I had made this video and he,
I remember he walked past me,

3067
02:40:54.570 --> 02:40:55.860
stopped right next to me,

3068
02:40:56.010 --> 02:40:59.570
looked at me and chicken neck meet and that was something like only bullies did

3069
02:40:59.571 --> 02:41:00.960
in like elementary school.

3070
02:41:00.960 --> 02:41:03.870
Like when you go up to somebody and he like flinched your face right into their

3071
02:41:03.871 --> 02:41:07.840
face.
Like,
Whoa,
you know,
like that,
you know,
that was like a week before.

3072
02:41:07.900 --> 02:41:10.170
So crazy chest checked me.

3073
02:41:10.620 --> 02:41:13.980
I was on the way off the stage before he went on stage and took the microphone

3074
02:41:13.981 --> 02:41:16.760
away from this guy.
He stood in front of me and my chest checking,

3075
02:41:16.780 --> 02:41:21.660
I can't believe,
and I was like,
are you crazy?
Of course he hasn't.
I was like,

3076
02:41:21.690 --> 02:41:24.780
I will.
I will end your life with my bare hands right here.

3077
02:41:24.810 --> 02:41:29.550
You know he started drinking.
Did he?
Yeah,
he's serious.
He's like 40 something.

3078
02:41:29.551 --> 02:41:30.930
He just started.
Wow.

3079
02:41:30.990 --> 02:41:34.890
I thought I heard this on a on Marin's pod because this is the reason why I

3080
02:41:34.891 --> 02:41:39.780
can't go back to the store.
They supported that guy.
They then brace that guy.

3081
02:41:40.210 --> 02:41:42.650
The worst exam you can still go anytime you want to do.

3082
02:41:42.730 --> 02:41:47.130
They set the worst example ever for the art and if there was one club who should

3083
02:41:47.160 --> 02:41:50.670
be governing of that?
You know,
it was a personal thing.
It wasn't.

3084
02:41:50.671 --> 02:41:54.330
It wasn't Mitsis choice because I had spoken even up there over four and a half,

3085
02:41:54.331 --> 02:41:57.260
you were doing that on behalf of all the guys.
He wasn't stealing from you.

3086
02:41:57.261 --> 02:41:58.240
You're doing it on behalf of the law.

3087
02:41:58.241 --> 02:42:02.190
It wasn't stealing from me because I was so vocal about it.
I knew it was coming.

3088
02:42:02.191 --> 02:42:06.150
So the end,
he did steal from me a bunch of times on the road.
I got,
I got,

3089
02:42:06.390 --> 02:42:09.570
I got calls from guys who opened for him all over the country.

3090
02:42:09.571 --> 02:42:11.670
They've got to get calls from guys who went to see him in Houston.

3091
02:42:11.671 --> 02:42:14.410
He was doing my bits.
He was,
he was doing everybody shit.

3092
02:42:14.700 --> 02:42:18.240
It wasn't just what you saw on the DVDs.
It was every fucking night he performed.

3093
02:42:18.390 --> 02:42:20.880
He was dealing people Shaddock that exposed him that night.

3094
02:42:20.881 --> 02:42:24.210
I can't believe I was there.
Right.
I mean it had to be done,

3095
02:42:24.300 --> 02:42:26.370
but that's what pissed me off about what Marin said.
It was like,

3096
02:42:26.371 --> 02:42:28.950
it's two bullies arguing over bullshit.
Like,
look man,

3097
02:42:29.130 --> 02:42:33.270
I might be allowed dude and I might be aggressive and I might be,
you know,

3098
02:42:33.510 --> 02:42:37.320
overly,
you know,
overly aggro.
But I'm not a bully.
Yeah.

3099
02:42:37.321 --> 02:42:39.810
You were championing the US,
our costs,
this person,

3100
02:42:39.811 --> 02:42:43.380
I'm going to be so nice to you.
If you're a nice guy,
I'm fucking for sure.

3101
02:42:43.381 --> 02:42:45.240
Nice back,
but if you're a dickhead to me,

3102
02:42:45.241 --> 02:42:48.690
I'm going to be a bigger dick back with that guy.

3103
02:42:48.691 --> 02:42:51.060
It wasn't even a matter of a bullying thing.

3104
02:42:51.061 --> 02:42:54.930
It was like we have a fucking criminal in our midst and it's being supported by

3105
02:42:54.931 --> 02:42:57.810
all the substructure.
It's being supported by all the club managers.

3106
02:42:57.811 --> 02:43:00.930
It's being supported by the thing agents who are profiting off this guy running

3107
02:43:00.931 --> 02:43:02.070
around stealing people's shit.

3108
02:43:02.160 --> 02:43:06.180
It's not like one guy like a Robin Williams who like occasionally he'll blurt

3109
02:43:06.181 --> 02:43:09.630
out someone's material or talking about a guy who's just straight ganking
people.

3110
02:43:09.631 --> 02:43:12.730
Right.
You know,
it's,
it was a totally different sort of a situation.

3111
02:43:12.910 --> 02:43:15.580
If you weren't there all the time like I was and you were,

3112
02:43:15.640 --> 02:43:18.090
you wouldn't see how horrible it was.
Yeah.

3113
02:43:18.360 --> 02:43:22.300
It was the worst atmosphere for creativity you could ever imagine.

3114
02:43:22.420 --> 02:43:25.720
Where everyone was worried and we used to have to light the fucking light up.

3115
02:43:25.721 --> 02:43:28.510
When the dude walked into the room,
you lit that light.

3116
02:43:29.320 --> 02:43:32.080
How many times do you like that?
Like a lot.
I knew when he was coming,

3117
02:43:32.110 --> 02:43:34.390
he was working the fucking cover booth.
Freddy was,

3118
02:43:34.391 --> 02:43:36.940
we're going to cover booth and when,
when men see would come in,

3119
02:43:37.060 --> 02:43:40.420
guys would need that light flashed for them to know that that guy was in the

3120
02:43:40.421 --> 02:43:43.330
room though that material is there and it's so dark.

3121
02:43:43.420 --> 02:43:46.300
It's amazing when you can okay that with yourself to still,

3122
02:43:46.330 --> 02:43:49.900
it would make comedy really smart.
Amazing that the club's allowed.

3123
02:43:50.290 --> 02:43:54.280
It's not amazing that one person crazy.
What's amazing is that these clubs go,

3124
02:43:54.281 --> 02:43:58.150
we can make money off this crazy person.
It's fucking not even just the clubs,

3125
02:43:58.151 --> 02:44:01.450
but it's like all of us to,
somebody should have said something more about it.

3126
02:44:01.451 --> 02:44:05.140
Yeah,
it took users.
It was,
but you know what?
Everyone says it like,
hey,

3127
02:44:05.141 --> 02:44:08.710
you did it.
You call them out.
It was a total random moment.

3128
02:44:08.990 --> 02:44:13.120
It didn't have to happen.
It wasn't planned out.
It was just he,
he,

3129
02:44:13.121 --> 02:44:15.240
what he did is he played on my ego,
you know,

3130
02:44:15.270 --> 02:44:16.690
was like he doesn't have the balls get up here.

3131
02:44:16.840 --> 02:44:19.420
I don't know if it was suicide by cop.
I don't know what it was.

3132
02:44:19.690 --> 02:44:22.660
It might've been because he had to know that this is going to end ugly.
Right?

3133
02:44:22.690 --> 02:44:24.460
What are you gonna do?
You're gonna intimidate me.
What are you going to do?

3134
02:44:24.461 --> 02:44:27.010
Are you gonna you gotta be wrong?
But he was so confident.

3135
02:44:27.011 --> 02:44:29.770
This is how I knew he was crazy.
When I went on stage,
he was so confident,

3136
02:44:29.920 --> 02:44:32.200
you know,
what the fuck have I ever stole?
When he was saying that to me,

3137
02:44:32.440 --> 02:44:35.670
he was so confident.
I was like,
oh my God,
am I crazy?
Did I make all this?

3138
02:44:35.671 --> 02:44:37.840
Sounds good.
I hate her.
Had My,

3139
02:44:37.940 --> 02:44:41.630
my whole philosophy and just be had been informed by my own jealousy.
Right?

3140
02:44:41.730 --> 02:44:43.510
So then I started naming bits and then as,

3141
02:44:43.511 --> 02:44:48.020
as I was naming basic swatch to fall apart,
I just watched his eyes were cracked.

3142
02:44:48.040 --> 02:44:50.440
Like glass was shattering in his eyes and like the,

3143
02:44:50.500 --> 02:44:53.590
the lens you'll be seeing the sunlight coming in and killing the vampire.

3144
02:44:54.040 --> 02:44:56.980
And then he sat down on the stool and then it became ugly and then it became the

3145
02:44:56.981 --> 02:44:58.900
audience turned on him.
And then at the end,

3146
02:44:58.901 --> 02:45:01.300
the crazy thing was after I got off stage,
it was like a half an hour.

3147
02:45:01.301 --> 02:45:02.980
It'd be rating him and you know,

3148
02:45:02.981 --> 02:45:06.070
and just exposing what he does and what's wrong with what he does.

3149
02:45:06.071 --> 02:45:07.030
And you're not an artist,

3150
02:45:07.150 --> 02:45:10.330
you're a fucking Myna bird and you repeat things that other people say and you

3151
02:45:10.331 --> 02:45:13.150
do what?
You take credit for their work.
You don't even understand what comedy is.

3152
02:45:13.270 --> 02:45:15.680
You don't understand the fucking language because you never learned it because

3153
02:45:15.681 --> 02:45:17.020
all he does repeat what other people say.

3154
02:45:17.140 --> 02:45:21.460
You're a person speaking in language you don't understand,
literally going crazy.

3155
02:45:21.550 --> 02:45:25.960
So this asshole,
so nuts.
He wants to perform after this.
Right?
He went on.

3156
02:45:25.990 --> 02:45:26.671
Do you remember that?

3157
02:45:26.671 --> 02:45:31.330
I remember they tried to do comedy comedy for like 10 minutes.
It was actually,

3158
02:45:31.460 --> 02:45:33.670
I actually have lots of footage of that people were going

3159
02:45:37.430 --> 02:45:39.790
and he kept going and then when he walked out,

3160
02:45:39.791 --> 02:45:42.760
it was like the end of Friday or something like Deebo just got beat up and

3161
02:45:42.761 --> 02:45:46.900
everybody was getting their kicks it to Carla.
Everybody did.

3162
02:45:47.630 --> 02:45:50.920
And then when I got the boot man,
he came back around on everybody,
you know,

3163
02:45:51.120 --> 02:45:55.970
he pulled me,
he pulled me aside and he's like,
oh wow.

3164
02:45:55.971 --> 02:45:57.760
It's like,
what are you want?
You know?

3165
02:45:57.761 --> 02:46:01.090
And then me and Steve asked him honestly were like,
then tell us about this,

3166
02:46:01.091 --> 02:46:03.640
but tell us about that.
But just like with Marin,
he has,

3167
02:46:04.030 --> 02:46:07.330
they should have the calming shores should have the comedy store should his

3168
02:46:07.420 --> 02:46:10.850
comedy shore.
Hello Freud.
Yeah,

3169
02:46:10.880 --> 02:46:13.310
that's what it's going to be after Mitzi dies.
Paul is going to rename it.

3170
02:46:13.900 --> 02:46:16.670
What they should have done is he should have stepped in and even if he wanted to

3171
02:46:16.671 --> 02:46:19.310
keep me band because I was filming there and they don't want me filming and

3172
02:46:19.320 --> 02:46:19.820
that's fine,

3173
02:46:19.820 --> 02:46:23.130
but you've got to make sure you don't have him headlines the next weekend.
Right.

3174
02:46:23.150 --> 02:46:27.650
And you don't get on stage and say,
this is my guy,
I'm with Carlos,

3175
02:46:27.980 --> 02:46:28.850
which is what he did.

3176
02:46:28.970 --> 02:46:33.170
You know what they did was support the worst vampire in the business and let

3177
02:46:33.171 --> 02:46:36.650
everybody to feel helpless and let everybody know that even though you are

3178
02:46:36.651 --> 02:46:38.810
successful and you do have things going on,

3179
02:46:38.811 --> 02:46:42.170
you can still get your life fucked with by somebody who's more successful.

3180
02:46:42.470 --> 02:46:45.470
And you could see that there are people that really do try to sabotage your

3181
02:46:45.471 --> 02:46:45.980
career.

3182
02:46:45.980 --> 02:46:49.610
If you expose someone for being a piece of shit and a thief and someone who's a

3183
02:46:49.640 --> 02:46:54.640
direct indirect opposition of what this art form is supposed to be all about,

3184
02:46:54.800 --> 02:46:58.640
which is you creating and forming your own shit and bring it out on stage and

3185
02:46:58.641 --> 02:47:02.570
people appreciating your work that you have talk after that you were with Gersh

3186
02:47:02.571 --> 02:47:07.070
at the time were still friends with uh,
my,
my agent at the time,

3187
02:47:07.071 --> 02:47:08.540
I don't want to mention his name because he's a good guy,

3188
02:47:08.720 --> 02:47:12.020
fucked up and he got in a bad situation and they made him choose.

3189
02:47:12.020 --> 02:47:15.470
The agency made him choose between Carlos and me and they only had me for

3190
02:47:15.471 --> 02:47:18.330
standup comedy.
They had him for standup comedy and television and film,

3191
02:47:18.790 --> 02:47:21.080
and so they were making more money off him that I was,

3192
02:47:21.081 --> 02:47:23.870
and they wanted me to either apologize to him or they're going to have to let me

3193
02:47:23.871 --> 02:47:27.380
go.
Did you guys ever talk again?
I ran into him.

3194
02:47:27.410 --> 02:47:29.690
We were on a flight once and we sat next to each other.

3195
02:47:29.830 --> 02:47:33.890
We were flying to do invincea.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
My agents.

3196
02:47:35.030 --> 02:47:39.710
Have you ever seen great movies?
I can't.
Nothing to say to him.

3197
02:47:39.711 --> 02:47:42.020
He and he knows everything he's going to say to me is not going to be real

3198
02:47:42.021 --> 02:47:44.860
anyway.
It's just going to be noise to try to make everything better and that's,

3199
02:47:44.890 --> 02:47:46.650
that's not going to happen.
Yeah.

3200
02:47:46.651 --> 02:47:50.360
So he's going to just come over and try to grow me like the little Beta monkey

3201
02:47:50.361 --> 02:47:52.550
trying to pick my little bugs off the alpha.

3202
02:47:52.820 --> 02:47:55.250
Who's going to come over and try and be nice to me and I'm going to go,
come on,

3203
02:47:55.251 --> 02:47:57.410
