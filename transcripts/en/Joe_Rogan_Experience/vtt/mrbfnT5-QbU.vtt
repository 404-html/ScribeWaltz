00:00:20.251 --> 00:00:21.740
<v Speaker 1>is brought to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Buy naturebox.</v>

14
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.930
<v Speaker 1>Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you ever had delicious and </v>

15
00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:26.930
<v Speaker 1>nutritious nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not only that,</v>

16
00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:27.320
<v Speaker 1>they sponsor the 10 minute podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

17
00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.610
<v Speaker 1>Box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually pretty good.</v>

18
00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:30.570
<v Speaker 1>It's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

19
00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.580
<v Speaker 1>I order you can order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I like about naturebox is that you </v>

20
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:36.840
<v Speaker 1>can order a specific stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I have them send me all gluten free</v>

21
00:00:36.841 --> 00:00:40.170
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I got like the Serratia cashews.</v>

22
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.790
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're devastating.</v>

23
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.820
<v Speaker 1>And then there's almonds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These blueberry almonds.</v>

24
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.860
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're fucking guilt free.</v>

25
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.830
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of stuff that you can get </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you know,</v>

26
00:00:49.831 --> 00:00:52.920
<v Speaker 1>it's more like pretzely stuff that </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably isn't the best for you,</v>

27
00:00:52.921 --> 00:00:56.580
<v Speaker 1>but what they always have is no </v>
<v Speaker 1>hydrogenated oils,</v>

28
00:00:56.581 --> 00:00:59.850
<v Speaker 1>no artificial colors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no artificial flavors,</v>

29
00:00:59.851 --> 00:01:02.440
<v Speaker 1>no artificial preservatives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no transfats,</v>

30
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.700
<v Speaker 1>no transfats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's really healthy stuff as far as </v>

31
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.570
<v Speaker 1>snacks go and depending on how you </v>
<v Speaker 1>choose,</v>

32
00:01:09.571 --> 00:01:12.020
<v Speaker 1>you can get it very healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Big Island pineapples.</v>

33
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.790
<v Speaker 1>Another great one I love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's their dried pineapple.</v>

34
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.160
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just slices of delicious,</v>

35
00:01:17.161 --> 00:01:19.620
<v Speaker 1>dried pineapple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically guilt free,</v>

36
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.210
<v Speaker 1>delicious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>awesome stuff.</v>

<v Speaker 1>vending machine food,</v>

42
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.720
<v Speaker 1>it's not that expensive either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you can get,</v>

43

<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get 20 bags for 40 bucks or </v>

<v Speaker 1>We're also brought to you by legalzoom.</v>

53
00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.680
<v Speaker 1>Legalzoom is a way of handling all sorts</v>
<v Speaker 1>of things online that you would normally</v>

54
00:02:16.681 --> 00:02:21.681
<v Speaker 1>have to go to a law office and meet with</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lawyer and pay a fuck load of money.</v>

55
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.600
<v Speaker 1>Most likely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead you could do it at home,</v>

56
00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.630
<v Speaker 1>drunk and naked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can be having sex and you could do </v>

57
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.541
<v Speaker 1>it with a laptop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could be giving head if you're so </v>

58
00:02:32.541 --> 00:02:33.540
<v Speaker 1>inclined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could give head and then come up for</v>

59
00:02:33.541 --> 00:02:35.670
<v Speaker 1>air every now and then and fill out some</v>
<v Speaker 1>forms.</v>

60
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.760
<v Speaker 1>I heard about legal zoom after they </v>
<v Speaker 1>sponsored my podcasts and I,</v>

61
00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.680
<v Speaker 1>but way too late because I set up an </v>
<v Speaker 1>LLC.</v>

62
00:02:40.681 --> 00:02:45.681
<v Speaker 1>It costs me $1,300</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you could have done it for like </v>

63
00:02:45.681 --> 00:02:45.681
<v Speaker 1>100 bucks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 bucks.</v>

64
00:02:45.681 --> 00:02:47.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can do it for 99 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can set it,</v>

65
00:02:47.361 --> 00:02:50.520
<v Speaker 1>you can incorporate or set up an llc for</v>
<v Speaker 1>99 bucks.</v>

66
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.550
<v Speaker 1>Someone told me you could do that free </v>
<v Speaker 1>online or that is like a bunch of steps </v>

67
00:02:55.861 --> 00:02:58.800
<v Speaker 1>that you have to go through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Legal Zoom makes it way more convenient.</v>

68
00:02:58.801 --> 00:03:00.820
<v Speaker 1>It's just a hundred bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking Weirdos.</v>

69
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:02.920
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

70
00:03:02.921 --> 00:03:07.921
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's way better than going to a a </v>

71
00:03:07.921 --> 00:03:07.921
<v Speaker 1>law office.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also.</v>

72
00:03:07.921 --> 00:03:09.310
<v Speaker 1>I'll law and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's.</v>

73
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you can do it for free.</v>

74
00:03:11.231 --> 00:03:12.880
<v Speaker 1>I think you have to do a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>different things.</v>

75
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.470
<v Speaker 1>The way legal zoom has it set up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's way easier.</v>

76
00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.070
<v Speaker 1>Fortunate they got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

<v Speaker 1>they got an a plus from the better </v>
<v Speaker 1>business bureau.</v>

78
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.560
<v Speaker 1>I love Shit like that so you don't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to worry about it.</v>

79
00:03:23.561 --> 00:03:25.480
<v Speaker 1>Plus I know a bunch of dudes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aubrey,</v>

<v Speaker 1>That was all done through legalzoom.</v>

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:33.070
<v Speaker 1>Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when incorporated desk won,</v>

83
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.280
<v Speaker 1>that was done through legal zoom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Add 10 customers would recommend </v>

84
00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.400
<v Speaker 1>legalzoom after they used it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know what that means,</v>

85
00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:44.550

161
00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:41.050
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yourself and that's what I've been </v>

162
00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:41.050
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you.</v>

164
00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:42.440
<v Speaker 1>With the kind of coffee?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

165
00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:47.420
<v Speaker 1>See we found out this is a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We actually talked about the fungus came</v>

166
00:06:47.421 --> 00:06:48.360
<v Speaker 1>out some bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

167
00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:49.750
<v Speaker 1>Well this is the deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

168
00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can never.</v>

169
00:06:52.641 --> 00:06:57.641
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to speculate anybody's </v>

170
00:06:57.641 --> 00:06:59.141
<v Speaker 1>intention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what I'll just tell you is the </v>

171
00:06:59.141 --> 00:07:00.941
<v Speaker 1>absolute facts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There have been cases where mycotoxins </v>

172
00:07:00.941 --> 00:07:02.270
<v Speaker 1>became an issue with coffee.</v>

173
00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:06.740
<v Speaker 1>Those cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of them have been resolved by going</v>

174
00:07:06.741 --> 00:07:11.741
<v Speaker 1>through these mycotoxin issues and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>rigorous testing and then figuring out </v>

175
00:07:11.741 --> 00:07:15.671
<v Speaker 1>ways to not provide an environment where</v>
<v Speaker 1>mycotoxins are toxins and hopefully </v>

176
00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:19.870
<v Speaker 1>heard that and took it and ran with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good for you.</v>

177
00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:21.710
<v Speaker 1>Here's the issue here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he stopped.</v>

178
00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:23.420
<v Speaker 1>He brought me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>

179
00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.450
<v Speaker 1>he brought me in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately me because he was,</v>

180
00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:31.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying it on my podcast and I repeated </v>

181
00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:33.821
<v Speaker 1>it without any research.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It used to be an issue and it can be an </v>

182
00:07:33.821 --> 00:07:36.290
<v Speaker 1>issue still if someone is not preparing </v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee correctly,</v>

183
00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:39.380
<v Speaker 1>but it's like when you buy really good </v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee,</v>

184
00:07:39.381 --> 00:07:42.740
<v Speaker 1>like there's a company called Rusty's </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hawaiian delicious,</v>

185
00:07:42.741 --> 00:07:47.741
<v Speaker 1>delicious coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their bags are rated by like coffee </v>

186
00:07:47.741 --> 00:07:50.831
<v Speaker 1>connoisseur,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sores were professional coffee graders </v>

187
00:07:50.831 --> 00:07:53.920
<v Speaker 1>that will taste the coffee and check out</v>
<v Speaker 1>various various beans and different </v>

188
00:07:54.291 --> 00:07:57.870
<v Speaker 1>roasts and then they grade it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they also tested for mycotoxins.</v>

189
00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:00.440
<v Speaker 1>Like if you have fungus in your fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee,</v>

190
00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:04.220
<v Speaker 1>you get a really low score.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fungus on my roast.</v>

191
00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:07.070
<v Speaker 1>They figured out a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

192
00:08:07.071 --> 00:08:12.071
<v Speaker 1>this is where it gets really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That coffee was originally established </v>

193
00:08:12.071 --> 00:08:15.461
<v Speaker 1>in Ethiopia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a dry climate and all these </v>

194
00:08:15.461 --> 00:08:17.210
<v Speaker 1>mycotoxin issues happened when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>started moving them out at Ethiopia,</v>

195
00:08:17.211 --> 00:08:19.070
<v Speaker 1>put them in other places where there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>moisture.</v>

196
00:08:19.071 --> 00:08:19.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

197
00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:21.620
<v Speaker 1>Growing them in different places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In California,</v>

198
00:08:21.621 --> 00:08:25.910
<v Speaker 1>wines have very few microtoxins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially Okra toxin a,</v>

199
00:08:25.911 --> 00:08:28.190
<v Speaker 1>which is the big one because it's so </v>
<v Speaker 1>dry,</v>

200
00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:30.620
<v Speaker 1>so they actually have very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very little of that.</v>

201
00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:32.600
<v Speaker 1>A very little issues with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

202
00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:34.460
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that interesting?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And corn as well.</v>

203
00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:36.750
<v Speaker 1>Corn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know there's.</v>

204
00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:39.740
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of different mycotoxins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the point.</v>

205
00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:43.190
<v Speaker 1>If you buy really good coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is most of you,</v>

206
00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:48.220
<v Speaker 1>what you buy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most likely you're not gonna have any </v>

207
00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:48.220
<v Speaker 1>issues whatsoever.</v>

208
00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:50.330
<v Speaker 1>If you do have issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>According to Dr Rhonda Patrick,</v>

209
00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:55.750
<v Speaker 1>she was saying that even like above </v>
<v Speaker 1>threshold doses of these mycotoxins even</v>

210
00:08:55.801 --> 00:09:00.801
<v Speaker 1>provide a beneficial reaction by your </v>
<v Speaker 1>body that your body reacting to these </v>

211
00:09:01.021 --> 00:09:05.430
<v Speaker 1>mycotoxins that aren't necessarily like </v>
<v Speaker 1>really bad for you in small doses,</v>

212
00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:10.610
<v Speaker 1>that your body might actually energize </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's immune system in response so it </v>

213
00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:12.120
<v Speaker 1>might have some sort of a corresponding </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive effect.</v>

214
00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:14.280
<v Speaker 1>This is obviously layman's terms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a retard.</v>

215
00:09:14.281 --> 00:09:15.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't really even know what I just </v>
<v Speaker 1>said.</v>

216
00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:18.420
<v Speaker 1>According to her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these things make sense.</v>

217
00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:23.930
<v Speaker 1>So what I'm saying is you can make that </v>
<v Speaker 1>style of coffee like coffee with grass </v>

218
00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:28.431
<v Speaker 1>fed butter and mct oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can make that with almost any good </v>

219
00:09:28.431 --> 00:09:31.400
<v Speaker 1>and you're blending it or you're just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just stuff that you're drinking </v>

220
00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:31.400
<v Speaker 1>right here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that delicious?</v>

221
00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:31.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't ever plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just.</v>

222
00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.360
<v Speaker 1>Black coffee scoop of butter.</v>

223
00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:36.150
<v Speaker 1>That's cool to t and start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fine too.</v>

224
00:09:36.151 --> 00:09:41.151
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a little more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A little Stevia can use the packets </v>

225
00:09:41.151 --> 00:09:41.220
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This bottle.</v>

226
00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:44.500
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A little too much in Jack.</v>

227
00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:49.410
<v Speaker 1>You if you only let,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a mist of Stevia is a plant extract</v>

228
00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.760
<v Speaker 1>zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zero sugar.</v>

229
00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.210
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to worry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

230
00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:54.570
<v Speaker 1>not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

231
00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:58.230
<v Speaker 1>it's probably like all things not great </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you ate it all day,</v>

232
00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even plants,</v>

233
00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:01.100
<v Speaker 1>I eat it all day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel great.</v>

234
00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:02.710
<v Speaker 1>Nine plants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our plants are toxic.</v>

235
00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:07.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean quite a lot of their own tie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They keep people from eating them </v>

236
00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:10.290
<v Speaker 1>discouraged when people are like juicing</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots and lots of leafy Greens.</v>

237
00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:12.570
<v Speaker 1>We'll do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll do that again.</v>

238
00:10:12.571 --> 00:10:14.520
<v Speaker 1>About the rest of the commercial was </v>
<v Speaker 1>just keep going.</v>

239
00:10:14.521 --> 00:10:16.140
<v Speaker 1>We don't have to play music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck it.</v>

240
00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:21.590
<v Speaker 1>Just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked throwing one out like that over </v>

241
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:21.590
<v Speaker 1>on a.com.</v>

242
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:21.590
<v Speaker 1>Use the code word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rogan saves money.</v>

243
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:22.340
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

244
00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:25.020
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this is the point is that this,</v>

245
00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:30.050
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these toxins may or may not be an issue </v>

246
00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:31.980
<v Speaker 1>in some coffee today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were at one point in time,</v>

247
00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:34.350
<v Speaker 1>but the coffee experts aren't worried </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>

248
00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:39.410
<v Speaker 1>When you talked to coffee experts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all worried about taste and </v>

249
00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:40.440
<v Speaker 1>flavor and where they're grown and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're also worried about the fact that</v>

250
00:10:40.441 --> 00:10:45.441
<v Speaker 1>the climate in Ethiopia apparently is </v>
<v Speaker 1>deteriorating because of global warming </v>

251
00:10:45.441 --> 00:10:49.850
<v Speaker 1>and they think within the next 50 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a good percentage of the species </v>

252
00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:51.360
<v Speaker 1>that only exists in Ethiopia will be </v>
<v Speaker 1>extinct.</v>

253
00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:52.350
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

254
00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:55.770
<v Speaker 1>Because there's all of the coffee in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world comes from Ethiopia.</v>

255
00:10:55.771 --> 00:10:58.200
<v Speaker 1>Originally my brother told me about this</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>

256
00:10:58.201 --> 00:11:03.201
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you realize in 50 years coffee is going </v>

257
00:11:03.201 --> 00:11:03.480
<v Speaker 1>to be no longer freaked out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I freaked out.</v>

258
00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:06.860
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will start storing comp.</v>

259
00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:09.450
<v Speaker 1>It'll be in Latin America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Costa Rica.</v>

260
00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:14.460
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't also matter like when you </v>

261
00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:18.021
<v Speaker 1>roast them versus when you drink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another thing that issue that </v>

262
00:11:18.021 --> 00:11:18.021
<v Speaker 1>people have with this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

263
00:11:18.021 --> 00:11:18.360
<v Speaker 1>upgraded coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although it's,</v>

264

<v Speaker 1>he's very successful at sells very well </v>

265
00:11:23.361 --> 00:11:23.361
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

266
00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:26.070
<v Speaker 1>so it's hard to keep on the shelf so </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's constantly moving.</v>

267
00:11:26.071 --> 00:11:27.930
<v Speaker 1>So you're getting fresh coffee when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>buying it.</v>

268
00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.660

<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:34.450
<v Speaker 2>He started as a blog and he said one </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing about white people,</v>

298
00:12:34.451 --> 00:12:37.060
<v Speaker 2>they are into their coffee man.</v>

300
00:12:41.201 --> 00:12:43.900
<v Speaker 2>you're the only guy I know who drinks </v>
<v Speaker 2>coffee in between rounds.</v>

<v Speaker 2>your cardio.</v>

305
00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:54.370
<v Speaker 2>He says he doesn't drink any.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't take any caffeine.</v>

306
00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:57.280

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:55.490
<v Speaker 1>a guy like Travis Brown or with guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>like John Jones or yourself,</v>

350
00:14:55.820 --> 00:15:00.820
<v Speaker 1>you getting a lot of people that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>athletes in other sports that were like </v>

351
00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:03.170
<v Speaker 1>high level athletes and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>transitioned over into fighting.</v>

352
00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:06.020
<v Speaker 1>So in the beginning you're seeing like </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're learning.</v>

353
00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:09.770
<v Speaker 1>They're really good athletes so they </v>
<v Speaker 1>move quicker than most people.</v>

354
00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:14.980
<v Speaker 1>They usually have a little bit more </v>
<v Speaker 1>physical explosion power than most </v>

355
00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:15.020
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then it takes them awhile to get all</v>

356
00:15:15.021 --> 00:15:20.021
<v Speaker 1>the techniques down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we're seeing like a lot of those </v>

357
00:15:20.021 --> 00:15:22.901
<v Speaker 1>dudes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is that we're seeing Osp is </v>

358
00:15:22.901 --> 00:15:22.901
<v Speaker 1>another one opens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say a lot.</v>

359
00:15:22.901 --> 00:15:24.890
<v Speaker 1>I think we're seeing a number of them </v>
<v Speaker 1>starting to transition,</v>

360
00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:28.850
<v Speaker 1>but the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I've done with tons of nfl guys,</v>

361
00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:33.910
<v Speaker 1>Mba,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when someone's trying to hit you in the </v>

362
00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:33.950
<v Speaker 1>face and you're just not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why it takes so long.</v>

363
00:15:33.951 --> 00:15:38.951
<v Speaker 1>I think for these athletes to adapt a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting because getting hit in the </v>

364
00:15:38.951 --> 00:15:38.951
<v Speaker 1>face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

365
00:15:38.951 --> 00:15:38.951
<v Speaker 1>it's just not either.</v>

366
00:15:38.951 --> 00:15:40.400
<v Speaker 1>You were born where you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

367
00:15:40.401 --> 00:15:42.140
<v Speaker 1>this is cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can live with this.</v>

368
00:15:42.141 --> 00:15:47.141
<v Speaker 1>I can learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Learn to get out of the way and you </v>

369
00:15:47.141 --> 00:15:47.141
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put my life on the line.</v>

370
00:15:47.141 --> 00:15:49.040
<v Speaker 1>And then usually when guys are that good</v>
<v Speaker 1>of athletes,</v>

371
00:15:49.041 --> 00:15:49.970
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forget this,</v>

372
00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:52.340
<v Speaker 1>forget this man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forget this,</v>

373
00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:53.270
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

374
00:15:53.310 --> 00:15:56.750
<v Speaker 1>I think you look like at the UFC and </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys starting to come around,</v>

375
00:15:56.751 --> 00:15:58.310
<v Speaker 1>but people think to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

376
00:15:58.430 --> 00:16:00.500
<v Speaker 1>in 10 years we have all these freak </v>
<v Speaker 1>athletes.</v>

377
00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:02.540
<v Speaker 1>You're not man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he's freak athletes.</v>

378
00:16:02.541 --> 00:16:05.000
<v Speaker 1>It's very rare you get a freak athlete </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's like,</v>

379
00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:10.120
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go fight another killer in </v>

380
00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:10.460
<v Speaker 1>a steel cage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a very interesting point.</v>

381
00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:12.770
<v Speaker 1>It's a very interesting point when </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's options to write,</v>

382
00:16:12.771 --> 00:16:17.771
<v Speaker 1>especially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when you're that good of an </v>

383
00:16:17.771 --> 00:16:17.771
<v Speaker 1>athlete and you're making way more </v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

384
00:16:17.771 --> 00:16:17.771
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily.</v>

385
00:16:17.771 --> 00:16:17.900
<v Speaker 1>Not necessarily.</v>

386
00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:20.000
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it depends on what level you're fighting</v>

387
00:16:20.001 --> 00:16:21.110
<v Speaker 1>in the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

388
00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:26.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a guy will say about this all </v>

389
00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:26.140
<v Speaker 1>the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

390
00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:26.140
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys don't get paid yet.</v>

391
00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:26.600
<v Speaker 1>I make a great living man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

392
00:16:26.601 --> 00:16:30.070
<v Speaker 1>It's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first one.</v>

393
00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:30.310
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

394
00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:31.450
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hold up.</v>

395
00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:33.440
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about the exception.</v>

396
00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.130
<v Speaker 1>I make more than a Lotta yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

397
00:16:37.131 --> 00:16:39.290
<v Speaker 1>here's what you have to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you look at pay,</v>

398
00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:43.160
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's pay that's listed like a.</v>

399
00:16:43.161 --> 00:16:45.190
<v Speaker 1>As far as like the purse that you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>admission,</v>

400
00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:50.250
<v Speaker 1>they list out what your staff does not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't take into account a lot of </v>

401
00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:54.521
<v Speaker 1>factors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of things that they want </v>

402
00:16:54.521 --> 00:16:56.171
<v Speaker 1>to remain private so you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not just getting paid that </v>

403
00:16:56.171 --> 00:16:56.171
<v Speaker 1>amount.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people are,</v>

404
00:16:56.171 --> 00:16:57.830
<v Speaker 1>some people are just getting paid that </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount,</v>

405
00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:01.480
<v Speaker 1>but guys you don't know that probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>should begin paid that amount,</v>

406
00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:05.870
<v Speaker 1>but when a guy is selling tickets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know someone is a big name fighter.</v>

407
00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:10.820
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of factors in there is </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's well incentives.</v>

408
00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:15.910
<v Speaker 1>Paperview pieces of paper for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like George St Pierre was making </v>

409
00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:15.910
<v Speaker 1>$5,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fight.</v>

410
00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:16.400
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

411
00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:18.380
<v Speaker 1>Let's make it a lot of fucking money and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

412
00:17:18.381 --> 00:17:20.000
<v Speaker 1>he's got sponsors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You said Gatorade,</v>

413
00:17:20.001 --> 00:17:25.001
<v Speaker 1>all this other stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All this other revenue coming in and </v>

414
00:17:25.001 --> 00:17:26.960
<v Speaker 1>George St Pierre made a load of money </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting so maybe maybe it didn't make </v>

415
00:17:27.621 --> 00:17:29.480
<v Speaker 1>as much as floyd mayweather,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but guess what?</v>

416
00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:34.840
<v Speaker 1>Floyd Mayweather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Floyd mayweather is one a bigger star to</v>

417
00:17:34.881 --> 00:17:36.680
<v Speaker 1>a better promoter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a fucking.</v>

418
00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:40.580
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't matter what a guide and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's that.</v>

419
00:17:40.581 --> 00:17:45.581
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social UFC now use is pretty worldwide </v>

420
00:17:45.581 --> 00:17:45.581
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't.</v>

421
00:17:45.581 --> 00:17:48.640
<v Speaker 1>You could be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There could be a spectacular fight in </v>

422
00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:51.041
<v Speaker 1>the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a crazy epic fight that everybody wants </v>

423
00:17:51.041 --> 00:17:51.041
<v Speaker 1>to see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That could do one and</v>

424
00:17:51.041 --> 00:17:52.020
<v Speaker 2>a half million,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2 million pay per view buys.</v>

425
00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:54.250
<v Speaker 2>That's what floyd mayweather is done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is possible.</v>

426
00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:59.280
<v Speaker 2>That could happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you think about before Floyd Floyd </v>

427
00:17:59.280 --> 00:17:59.280
<v Speaker 2>Mayweather,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>

428
00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:00.210
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to find like a guy since Oscar</v>
<v Speaker 2>de la Hoya,</v>

429
00:18:00.211 --> 00:18:02.310
<v Speaker 2>maybe manny Pacquiao a guy who can do </v>
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>

430
00:18:02.311 --> 00:18:04.860
<v Speaker 2>There's only a few of those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like everybody wants to say,</v>

431
00:18:04.861 --> 00:18:06.560
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in boxing they make so much more money.</v>

432
00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:07.840
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's about five of.</v>

433
00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:10.680
<v Speaker 2>You have those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about the exception.</v>

434
00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:15.420
<v Speaker 2>People always refer to the exception </v>
<v Speaker 2>mayweather Pacquiao or the exception.</v>

435
00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:18.510
<v Speaker 2>Look at the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you watch this,</v>

436
00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:21.900
<v Speaker 2>this last fight with Bradley,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at the undercard.</v>

437
00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:25.440
<v Speaker 2>It was pure shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was horrible.</v>

438
00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:28.140
<v Speaker 2>Those guys are scrapping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was a good fight.</v>

439
00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:30.340
<v Speaker 2>I thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought the undercard was pack.</v>

440
00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:32.070
<v Speaker 2>Y'all Bradley's pack your bag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was good.</v>

441
00:18:32.071 --> 00:18:37.071
<v Speaker 2>That was a really good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were some good fights in the </v>

442
00:18:37.071 --> 00:18:37.071
<v Speaker 2>undercard.</v>

443
00:18:37.071 --> 00:18:37.071
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I enjoyed it.</v>

444
00:18:37.071 --> 00:18:38.590
<v Speaker 2>Who was your favorite on the undercard?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

445
00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:40.320
<v Speaker 2>I'd have to look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

446
00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:41.760
<v Speaker 2>That's my.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my,</v>

447
00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:46.880
<v Speaker 2>that's my point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the problem with lots of no one </v>

448
00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:50.000
<v Speaker 2>gives a flying hoot about the underdog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one just no one gives a shit because </v>

449
00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.260
<v Speaker 2>you don't know him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These guys are super talented and </v>

450
00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:55.170
<v Speaker 2>they're not making any money on time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You okay?</v>

451
00:18:55.171 --> 00:18:57.060
<v Speaker 2>Here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At a certain point in time,</v>

452
00:18:57.090 --> 00:19:02.090
<v Speaker 2>there's only so many fucking room room </v>
<v Speaker 2>for so many fighters you can keep in </v>

453
00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:03.580
<v Speaker 2>your head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Put boxing,</v>

454
00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:05.490
<v Speaker 2>boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

455
00:19:05.491 --> 00:19:06.160
<v Speaker 2>let's go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

456
00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:08.960
<v Speaker 2>at heavyweight especially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got clear.</v>

457
00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:14.030
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Klitschko could probably deliver pizza </v>

458
00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:14.030
<v Speaker 2>next door and no one's going to ask for </v>
<v Speaker 2>an autograph.</v>

459
00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:14.280
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that weird?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy,</v>

460
00:19:14.281 --> 00:19:19.281
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's was so dominant that your </v>

461
00:19:19.281 --> 00:19:19.281
<v Speaker 2>heavyweight champ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one gives a shit.</v>

462
00:19:19.281 --> 00:19:19.281
<v Speaker 2>That's so weird.</v>

463
00:19:19.281 --> 00:19:21.600
<v Speaker 2>I find people were tweeting about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>under under crowd.</v>

464
00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:24.450
<v Speaker 2>They were tweeting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being defensive about the,</v>

465
00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:25.440
<v Speaker 2>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

466
00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:30.860
<v Speaker 2>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hbo commentators were being defensive </v>

467
00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:32.130
<v Speaker 2>about the quality of the undercard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So maybe you're right,</v>

468
00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:36.120
<v Speaker 2>I just tuned in and I may or may not </v>
<v Speaker 2>have been high as fuck.</v>

469
00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:40.600

<v Speaker 2>It hasn't.</v>

471
00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:45.870
<v Speaker 2>That's a misconception.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It hasn't fallen by the wayside.</v>

472
00:19:45.871 --> 00:19:48.820
<v Speaker 2>It's just there's only a few guys that </v>
<v Speaker 2>can sell big pay per view.</v>

473
00:19:48.821 --> 00:19:50.910
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like maybe you know,</v>

474
00:19:50.911 --> 00:19:53.330
<v Speaker 2>there's maybe like four or five guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>that can sell.</v>

475
00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:54.600
<v Speaker 2>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tell me one story.</v>

476
00:19:54.601 --> 00:19:56.790
<v Speaker 2>Look at the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a countdown.</v>

<v Speaker 2>decided to turn to fighting the UFC does</v>

479
00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:07.230
<v Speaker 2>the best job of marketing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's guys.</v>

480
00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:10.760
<v Speaker 2>There was one fight that was actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>really good vargas versus that.</v>

481
00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:11.940
<v Speaker 2>A Russian cat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

482
00:20:11.941 --> 00:20:12.980
<v Speaker 2>That was a good fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

483
00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:14.430
<v Speaker 2>They were both on the feeding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

484
00:20:14.431 --> 00:20:15.750
<v Speaker 2>That was good for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a very good.</v>

485
00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:20.820
<v Speaker 2>Again though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about that dude versus </v>

486
00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:20.820
<v Speaker 2>Russian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do these motherfuckers,</v>

487
00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:24.420
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beast Russians that are making their way</v>

488
00:20:24.421 --> 00:20:26.820
<v Speaker 2>into mma now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making their way into boxing now.</v>

489
00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:29.480
<v Speaker 2>It's really fascinating how many bad ass</v>
<v Speaker 2>Russians.</v>

490
00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:33.170
<v Speaker 2>It's just living in the area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Animals.</v>

491
00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:36.090
<v Speaker 2>Scary really well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also the epigenetics,</v>

492
00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:37.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're.</v>

493
00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:41.010
<v Speaker 2>They're saying that now that people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>have had family members,</v>

494
00:20:41.011 --> 00:20:43.200
<v Speaker 2>this was something that's passed down </v>
<v Speaker 2>through sperm.</v>

495
00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:48.470
<v Speaker 2>They believe traumatic events through </v>
<v Speaker 2>your ancestry or passed down through </v>

496
00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:53.191
<v Speaker 2>sperm and people who are children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who were the children's children </v>

497
00:20:53.651 --> 00:20:58.651
<v Speaker 2>and children of people who have survived</v>
<v Speaker 2>traumatic disorders or traumatic </v>

498
00:20:58.651 --> 00:21:02.821
<v Speaker 2>incidents were more likely to develop </v>
<v Speaker 2>all sorts of mental problems were more </v>

499
00:21:02.821 --> 00:21:05.380
<v Speaker 2>likely to be like schizophrenia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like all these,</v>

500
00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:10.530
<v Speaker 2>all these issues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mental issues that they could directly </v>

501
00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:12.460
<v Speaker 2>correlate possibly to the trauma that </v>
<v Speaker 2>their ancestors have established.</v>

502
00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:16.110
<v Speaker 2>Now think about how rude you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're little,</v>

503
00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:19.480
<v Speaker 2>if your little kenny grown up in Malibu </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you want to be a fighter,</v>

528
00:22:24.851 --> 00:22:26.920
<v Speaker 2>land but devastating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what we're talking about.</v>

00:22:40.931 --> 00:22:44.440
<v Speaker 2>19 year old or your Sergio Martinez </v>
<v Speaker 2>started at 30,</v>

<v Speaker 2>no matter when you start,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your clock is ticking.</v>

<v Speaker 2>prime and you're going to have these </v>

541
00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:01.350
<v Speaker 2>many great fights in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter when you start talking</v>

00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:03.310
<v Speaker 2>to eve Edwards about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's 37 now and he's,</v>

543
00:23:03.311 --> 00:23:08.311
<v Speaker 2>he's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was saying one of the frustrating </v>

544
00:23:08.311 --> 00:23:08.311
<v Speaker 2>things for fighters I think is that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>learn the art.</v>

545
00:23:08.311 --> 00:23:09.130
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you continue to learn.</v>

546
00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:14.160
<v Speaker 2>There's so much to learn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you continue to learn and then you </v>

547
00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:17.341
<v Speaker 2>get to be 37,</v>
<v Speaker 2>38 and you may be a step slower but you </v>

548
00:23:17.341 --> 00:23:17.650
<v Speaker 2>know so much more so you just want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>try it out.</v>

549
00:23:17.651 --> 00:23:20.890
<v Speaker 2>But the game is also timing and speed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And guess what?</v>

550
00:23:20.891 --> 00:23:24.220
<v Speaker 2>That's why it came about because those </v>
<v Speaker 2>37,</v>

551
00:23:24.221 --> 00:23:25.660
<v Speaker 2>38 year olds are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dang,</v>

00:23:25.661 --> 00:23:28.720
<v Speaker 2>I know so much man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my body's not the same.</v>

553
00:23:28.930 --> 00:23:31.270
<v Speaker 2>Let me talk this doctor over here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we have epic.</v>

554
00:23:31.271 --> 00:23:33.730
<v Speaker 2>Dammit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we've got big data.</v>

555
00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:36.960
<v Speaker 2>It's not an episodic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an epic.</v>

556
00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:39.640
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right though.</v>

557
00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:42.970
<v Speaker 2>In Brazil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spinning back,</v>

558
00:23:42.971 --> 00:23:45.540
<v Speaker 2>kick in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people's faces off in Brazil.</v>

559
00:23:45.541 --> 00:23:47.840
<v Speaker 2>All T are teed up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe Silva said it best.</v>

560
00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:53.110
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like [inaudible] or downloaded a </v>

561
00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:53.290
<v Speaker 2>taekwondo black belt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of a sudden thrown.</v>

562
00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:58.520
<v Speaker 2>We'll never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never to a wheelchair and then knocked </v>

563
00:23:58.520 --> 00:23:58.520
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Luke rockhold.</v>

564
00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:03.340
<v Speaker 2>Luke rockhold is a beast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean for him to do it with ease and </v>

565
00:24:03.651 --> 00:24:05.990
<v Speaker 2>then bisbing what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you nailed it.</v>

566
00:24:06.010 --> 00:24:11.010
<v Speaker 2>What you nailed is exactly what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that these guys get older and they </v>

567
00:24:11.010 --> 00:24:13.490
<v Speaker 2>get so much more experienced,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so much more knowledge,</v>

568
00:24:13.491 --> 00:24:15.020
<v Speaker 2>but that's the nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Balance.</v>

569
00:24:15.021 --> 00:24:17.480
<v Speaker 2>Nature gives you that experience and </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge so you can teach.</v>

570
00:24:17.481 --> 00:24:21.140
<v Speaker 2>It's like the two old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the two old buffalo,</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's why guys do drugs and stuff.</v>

637
00:26:53.041 --> 00:26:58.041
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the people are freaks and </v>

639
00:26:59.991 --> 00:27:02.130
<v Speaker 2>never opened the fucking curtain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those people are taking the same concept</v>

640
00:27:02.131 --> 00:27:02.790
<v Speaker 2>with sex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>if you do it on molly when all that </v>

718
00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:23.520
<v Speaker 3>You think about all the other avenues </v>
<v Speaker 3>you could have gone down to avoid </v>

719
00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:27.451
<v Speaker 3>jumping into that cage for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you add everything goes through </v>

720
00:30:27.451 --> 00:30:27.451
<v Speaker 3>your mind when all the other avenues in </v>

<v Speaker 3>I could've done this blending.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that.</v>

<v Speaker 3>When does that go away?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When does that go away?</v>

727
00:30:39.970 --> 00:30:42.360
<v Speaker 3>A man pray,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

728
00:30:42.370 --> 00:30:43.180
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

729
00:30:43.181 --> 00:30:45.040
<v Speaker 3>When I get in the cage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I hit the Kratom cool.</v>

730
00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:46.720
<v Speaker 3>In the back I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

731
00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:50.310
<v Speaker 3>what are we doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So once you hit the crowd then you like,</v>

732
00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:55.320
<v Speaker 3>it's on your load and your body can </v>
<v Speaker 3>relax and at least it's going to get a </v>

733
00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:56.640
<v Speaker 3>release from all this tension.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

734
00:30:56.770 --> 00:30:59.230
<v Speaker 3>isn't that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like once the first round starts,</v>

735
00:30:59.410 --> 00:31:00.370
<v Speaker 3>people would think like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

736
00:31:00.371 --> 00:31:03.820
<v Speaker 3>it must be scary to fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I would imagine that the most brutal</v>

737
00:31:03.821 --> 00:31:06.870
<v Speaker 3>thing is just getting the buildup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This building.</v>

741
00:31:13.411 --> 00:31:13.411
<v Speaker 3>second,</v>
<v Speaker 3>third fight.</v>

742
00:31:13.411 --> 00:31:15.430
<v Speaker 3>In Toronto you'll see one 65 million </v>
<v Speaker 3>summitry own.</v>

<v Speaker 3>at night.</v>

744
00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:21.580
<v Speaker 3>You're waiting around all day thinking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about the fight and when do you eat?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Your kid wants to fight and they,</v>

811
00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:54.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most likely there's going to be some </v>

812
00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:54.620
<v Speaker 1>trouble down the road with his brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he's a fighter,</v>

813
00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:54.620
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>

814
00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:57.680
<v Speaker 1>You say you do whatever you want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's what you want to do.</v>

815
00:33:57.770 --> 00:33:59.960
<v Speaker 1>You have to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't have asset.</v>

816
00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:01.850
<v Speaker 1>You can't have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want my kid to happen.</v>

817
00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:03.710
<v Speaker 1>I didn't say lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Muggy here.</v>

818
00:34:04.210 --> 00:34:06.080
<v Speaker 1>If you want to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that's what you want to do,</v>

819
00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:11.140
<v Speaker 1>that's what you should do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anyone should do anything </v>

820
00:34:11.140 --> 00:34:12.050
<v Speaker 1>other than that's gets to a certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>point until,</v>

821
00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:17.080
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I wanted to do when I was </v>

822
00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:17.080
<v Speaker 1>young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to fight.</v>

823
00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:17.080
<v Speaker 1>When I first figured out at a certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>point in time,</v>

824
00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:18.890
<v Speaker 1>there was no future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when I stopped doing it.</v>

825
00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:23.950
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm worried about bringing made you </v>

826
00:34:23.950 --> 00:34:23.950
<v Speaker 1>realize there is no fuel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing in 1989 when my hand,</v>

827
00:34:23.950 --> 00:34:25.580
<v Speaker 1>my last kickboxing match,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was nothing.</v>

828
00:34:25.581 --> 00:34:27.650
<v Speaker 1>There was no kickboxing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taekwondo.</v>

829
00:34:28.050 --> 00:34:33.050
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't respect it the way I used to </v>
<v Speaker 1>respect it because I started kickboxing </v>

830
00:34:33.050 --> 00:34:36.410
<v Speaker 1>and I realized kickboxing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start eating it.</v>

831
00:34:36.470 --> 00:34:41.470
<v Speaker 1>I fought above the waist pka style and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then I started training more and then I </v>

832
00:34:42.501 --> 00:34:46.990
<v Speaker 1>realized like there was even more holes </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the above the waist time,</v>

833
00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:48.950
<v Speaker 1>but above the waist pk style.</v>

834
00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:51.210
<v Speaker 1>The.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The real problem was the boxing there.</v>

835
00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:53.840
<v Speaker 1>I had done taekwondo for so long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like my,</v>

836
00:34:53.890 --> 00:34:58.890
<v Speaker 1>my hands were shit and my ability to </v>
<v Speaker 1>like move and throw kicks and punches </v>

837
00:34:58.890 --> 00:35:00.620
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was all disjointed.</v>

838
00:35:00.621 --> 00:35:02.300
<v Speaker 1>It just wasn't the right way to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

839
00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:06.200
<v Speaker 1>Then when did you get into Jujitsu?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ninety six.</v>

840
00:35:06.590 --> 00:35:07.090
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

841
00:35:07.150 --> 00:35:08.040
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Y'All caught me at it.</v>

842
00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:13.740
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went through this period where I was </v>

843
00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:15.740
<v Speaker 1>training like all the time in a martial </v>
<v Speaker 1>art that had all these holes in it,</v>

844
00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:17.840
<v Speaker 1>so I wasn't ever going to go back and </v>
<v Speaker 1>compete,</v>

845
00:35:17.841 --> 00:35:20.960
<v Speaker 1>like try to make the US Olympic team or </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything like that because I didn't feel</v>

846
00:35:20.961 --> 00:35:25.961
<v Speaker 1>the same way about taekwondo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to just do it anymore </v>

847
00:35:25.961 --> 00:35:28.720
<v Speaker 1>because I knew how easy it is for a guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>just cover up and walk you down and </v>

848
00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:33.161
<v Speaker 1>corner you in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a ring and fuck you up because you </v>

849
00:35:33.161 --> 00:35:33.830
<v Speaker 1>don't know how to deal with hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just there was so many holes in it.</v>

850
00:35:34.070 --> 00:35:37.920
<v Speaker 1>So it's so much easier to punch you in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the face when a guys were</v>

851
00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:43.430
<v Speaker 2>throwing kicks and punches together and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you didn't understand like the rhythm </v>

852
00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:46.500
<v Speaker 2>and the distance of punches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when I went from that,</v>

853
00:35:46.501 --> 00:35:49.110
<v Speaker 2>like I had no choice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was no options.</v>

854
00:35:49.170 --> 00:35:52.020
<v Speaker 2>But if there was an option,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if kickboxing paid,</v>

855
00:35:52.021 --> 00:35:56.820
<v Speaker 2>like what boxing does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there was a UFC option at that time I</v>

856
00:35:56.821 --> 00:36:01.821
<v Speaker 2>would have had to learn grappling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I probably still wouldn't have </v>

857
00:36:01.821 --> 00:36:01.821
<v Speaker 2>competed in the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If there was something like that,</v>

858
00:36:01.821 --> 00:36:02.920
<v Speaker 2>like when I first started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

859
00:36:02.970 --> 00:36:05.280
<v Speaker 2>grappling when I first started Jujitsu </v>
<v Speaker 2>in [inaudible] 96,</v>

860
00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:08.210
<v Speaker 2>I was amazed at how easy it was for </v>
<v Speaker 2>mended,</v>

861
00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:11.460
<v Speaker 2>just raped me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just ragdoll me,</v>

862
00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:14.430
<v Speaker 2>choked me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Armbar me at will because I had,</v>

863
00:36:14.490 --> 00:36:17.910
<v Speaker 2>they looked the same size as me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they look pretty similar.</v>

864
00:36:17.911 --> 00:36:19.740
<v Speaker 2>I looked at these people and I'd be </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

865
00:36:19.741 --> 00:36:21.090
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not bigger than me.</v>

866
00:36:21.091 --> 00:36:22.740
<v Speaker 2>Like if I realize how vulnerable you </v>
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>

867
00:36:22.770 --> 00:36:24.060
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's disturbing.</v>

868
00:36:24.210 --> 00:36:29.210
<v Speaker 2>I think fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like even learning a little bit of fun </v>

869
00:36:29.210 --> 00:36:29.210
<v Speaker 2>and makes you more afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not less for more humble for sure.</v>

870
00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:34.430
<v Speaker 2>So also don't you feel like at all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pro athletes fighters are probably the </v>

871
00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:36.060
<v Speaker 2>most approachable in the most down to </v>
<v Speaker 2>earth,</v>

872
00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:37.980
<v Speaker 2>easy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>easy shot.</v>

873
00:36:38.130 --> 00:36:41.940
<v Speaker 2>There's a reason why when a UFC fighter </v>
<v Speaker 2>goes into an event,</v>

874
00:36:41.941 --> 00:36:43.830
<v Speaker 2>whether it's the sps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>

875
00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:44.990
<v Speaker 2>all sorts of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

876
00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:47.640
<v Speaker 2>There can be NBA,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nhl,</v>

877
00:36:47.641 --> 00:36:48.870
<v Speaker 2>nfl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the WHO's who,</v>

878
00:36:48.871 --> 00:36:50.430
<v Speaker 2>actors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The room wants.</v>

879
00:36:50.450 --> 00:36:55.450
<v Speaker 2>Talk to the finer because guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one was willing to do what a fighter </v>

880
00:36:55.450 --> 00:36:59.601
<v Speaker 2>does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when a famous fighter walks in the </v>

881
00:36:59.601 --> 00:36:59.601
<v Speaker 2>room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's the center of attention.</v>

882
00:36:59.601 --> 00:36:59.601
<v Speaker 2>Every time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

883
00:36:59.601 --> 00:37:00.030
<v Speaker 2>that's fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And every time when,</v>

884
00:37:00.031 --> 00:37:02.520
<v Speaker 2>if there's Michael Jordan and like Uriah</v>
<v Speaker 2>Faber,</v>

885
00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:07.550
<v Speaker 2>different store in Michael Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Michael Jordan's lithium now Muhammad </v>

886
00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:10.170
<v Speaker 2>Ali.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Michael Jordan.</v>

887
00:37:10.171 --> 00:37:13.110
<v Speaker 2>I bet you Muhammad Ali's going to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>some Jordan's mom.</v>

888
00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:15.840
<v Speaker 2>I'll leave right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's on whatever when he was young.</v>

889
00:37:15.850 --> 00:37:16.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about.</v>

890
00:37:16.830 --> 00:37:17.640
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's prep Mike.</v>

891
00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:19.020
<v Speaker 2>Mike Tyson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>86.</v>

892
00:37:19.050 --> 00:37:19.920
<v Speaker 2>Mike Tyson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mike doing.</v>

893
00:37:19.921 --> 00:37:21.810
<v Speaker 2>I bet you more people go up to Mike </v>
<v Speaker 2>Tyson,</v>

894
00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:26.840
<v Speaker 2>Mike Tyson and 86 taps into the street </v>
<v Speaker 2>and people would call their friends to </v>

895
00:37:27.230 --> 00:37:32.230
<v Speaker 2>the fact that there's a man in the room </v>
<v Speaker 2>that can kill everybody with his bare </v>

896
00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:32.230
<v Speaker 2>hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

897
00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:32.230
<v Speaker 2>and that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

898
00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:33.690
<v Speaker 2>that's fascinating to met.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the John l Sullivan.</v>

899
00:37:33.691 --> 00:37:35.560
<v Speaker 2>I can lick any man in this room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but everyone.</v>

900
00:37:35.610 --> 00:37:37.470
<v Speaker 2>When you're a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone wants to be a fighter.</v>

901
00:37:37.471 --> 00:37:38.830
<v Speaker 2>You're fighting your brother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your kid.</v>

902
00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:39.970
<v Speaker 2>The neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

903
00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:42.960
<v Speaker 2>What sports boiled down to the raw </v>
<v Speaker 2>element.</v>

904
00:37:43.050 --> 00:37:45.510
<v Speaker 2>It's like the game you're playing is </v>
<v Speaker 2>let's play,</v>

905
00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:47.060
<v Speaker 2>kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's try.</v>

906
00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:48.700
<v Speaker 2>You try to kill me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried to kill you in.</v>

907
00:37:48.990 --> 00:37:51.300
<v Speaker 2>Some of them are the game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

908
00:37:51.390 --> 00:37:53.640
<v Speaker 2>Like football's a game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basketball is a game.</v>

909
00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:55.410
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if if Lebron James,</v>

910
00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:57.050
<v Speaker 2>Mrs Jumpshot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey listen,</v>

911
00:37:57.060 --> 00:38:02.060
<v Speaker 2>he's going to go tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I missed the timing of Mark Hunt's </v>

912
00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:03.150
<v Speaker 2>left hook,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

913
00:38:03.210 --> 00:38:05.880
<v Speaker 2>my jaws will be shattered in 30 </v>
<v Speaker 2>different spots.</v>

914
00:38:05.970 --> 00:38:07.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm not fighting for probably a year and</v>
<v Speaker 2>a half.</v>

915
00:38:07.381 --> 00:38:09.750
<v Speaker 2>That's the difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the stakes are a lot higher.</v>

916
00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:12.210
<v Speaker 2>Way Higher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not even comparable.</v>

917
00:38:12.211 --> 00:38:17.211
<v Speaker 2>It not comparable at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could lose 20 basketball games in a </v>

918
00:38:17.211 --> 00:38:20.721
<v Speaker 2>row and still go to the movies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You imagine if you lost 20 fights in a </v>

919
00:38:20.721 --> 00:38:20.721
<v Speaker 2>row,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not going to have a job.</v>

920
00:38:20.721 --> 00:38:22.020
<v Speaker 2>It'd be impossible when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>physically.</v>

921
00:38:22.390 --> 00:38:22.680
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

922
00:38:22.681 --> 00:38:27.681
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eddie Bravo and I were talking about </v>

923
00:38:27.681 --> 00:38:27.681
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a perfect way to describe.</v>

924
00:38:27.681 --> 00:38:31.491
<v Speaker 2>One of the great things about Hugh Jitsu</v>
<v Speaker 2>is think about how many times you've </v>

925
00:38:31.491 --> 00:38:32.460
<v Speaker 2>been tapped in your life in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Jujitsu.</v>

926
00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:34.980
<v Speaker 2>I probably been tapped a 100 times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

927
00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:36.190
<v Speaker 2>What if I had been head</v>

928
00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:37.970
<v Speaker 1>kick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knocked out 100 times?</v>

929
00:38:38.410 --> 00:38:41.500
<v Speaker 1>What if 100 times I got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll kick like Luke rockhold.</v>

930
00:38:42.130 --> 00:38:44.520
<v Speaker 1>Could you imagine a person who's been </v>
<v Speaker 1>wheelchair?</v>

931
00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:48.340
<v Speaker 1>I'd be dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you could take full meal.</v>

932
00:38:48.341 --> 00:38:51.880
<v Speaker 1>Kicks it back to those in your life to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have some problems.</v>

933
00:38:51.910 --> 00:38:54.340
<v Speaker 1>You'd have nothing left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd have literally nothing left,</v>

934
00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:59.520
<v Speaker 1>but you can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can get rid of naked choked 100 </v>

935
00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:00.500
<v Speaker 1>times in a month and you're okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>True.</v>

936
00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:02.650
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be sore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're really sore,</v>

937
00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:05.990
<v Speaker 1>but you're going to be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a big difference between the</v>

938
00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:08.770
<v Speaker 1>teeth move,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is the difference in striking.</v>

939
00:39:08.890 --> 00:39:10.810
<v Speaker 1>If someone's about to blast me with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right hand,</v>

940
00:39:10.811 --> 00:39:12.160
<v Speaker 1>I can't tap out and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>

941
00:39:12.161 --> 00:39:12.700
<v Speaker 1>we're good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

942
00:39:12.701 --> 00:39:13.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got that.</v>

943
00:39:13.331 --> 00:39:14.810
<v Speaker 1>You got that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's good too.</v>

944
00:39:15.530 --> 00:39:20.530
<v Speaker 1>If listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to get the guy who's </v>

945
00:39:20.530 --> 00:39:20.530
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I get a of some,</v>

946
00:39:20.530 --> 00:39:20.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to rip your arm up.</v>

947
00:39:20.530 --> 00:39:21.870
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna be in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some times,</v>

948
00:39:22.210 --> 00:39:23.630
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to be able to roll </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyday.</v>

949
00:39:24.050 --> 00:39:24.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the difference.</v>

950
00:39:24.881 --> 00:39:26.560
<v Speaker 1>That's true too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true too.</v>

951
00:39:26.650 --> 00:39:28.080
<v Speaker 1>There's a way out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just do.</v>

952
00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:30.580
<v Speaker 1>There's a white flag in boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

953
00:39:30.581 --> 00:39:32.200
<v Speaker 1>and these other sports.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no white flat.</v>

954
00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:37.380
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's so crazy when someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't use that white flag and you </v>

955
00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:37.630
<v Speaker 1>marched.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her shit gets snapped like hands.</v>

956
00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:41.770
<v Speaker 1>You're out for a long watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sakharova break his arm.</v>

957
00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:43.920

<v Speaker 1>Tim Silvia and Frank Mir.</v>

959
00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:48.800
<v Speaker 1>Frank Mir snapped his forearm and half </v>
<v Speaker 1>earlier,</v>

960
00:39:49.330 --> 00:39:51.160
<v Speaker 1>Tim Silvia's trying to punch him with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the left.</v>

961
00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:55.510
<v Speaker 1>He knew something was wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was like,</v>

962
00:39:55.511 --> 00:39:56.710
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck it.</v>

963
00:39:56.711 --> 00:39:59.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to hit him with my hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't see that.</v>

964
00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:00.850
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's snapped.</v>

965
00:40:00.970 --> 00:40:04.040
<v Speaker 1>Like the forearm was to stop.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Didn't know what was going on.</v>

969
00:40:10.661 --> 00:40:13.930
<v Speaker 1>So the audience was yelling and I had </v>

<v Speaker 1>You see?</v>

1006
00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:30.460
<v Speaker 1>Everybody is saying that he doesn't let </v>
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>

1007
00:41:30.490 --> 00:41:32.380
<v Speaker 1>They're going to jump on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No matter what he does.</v>

1008
00:41:32.381 --> 00:41:34.040
<v Speaker 1>If he gets submission,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're jumping on him.</v>

1009
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:37.250
<v Speaker 2>He absolutely is held submissions for </v>
<v Speaker 2>too long ago.</v>

1010
00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:38.870
<v Speaker 2>Absolute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just once,</v>

1011
00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:44.140
<v Speaker 2>many times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's fights of his in Brazil where </v>

1012
00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:45.040
<v Speaker 2>he's got a lock on a guy and he will not</v>
<v Speaker 2>let go in the referees.</v>

1013
00:41:45.041 --> 00:41:48.020
<v Speaker 2>Prior Anatomy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He will not let go and I don't remember.</v>

1014
00:41:48.021 --> 00:41:51.560
<v Speaker 2>It was a choke or was a leg lock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he fucked that guy up.</v>

1015
00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:53.410
<v Speaker 2>I heard in training.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's the exact same way.</v>

1016
00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:55.760
<v Speaker 2>You don't really only trains with his </v>
<v Speaker 2>brother,</v>

1017
00:41:55.890 --> 00:41:57.740
<v Speaker 2>his brother.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't do that with everyone else.</v>

1020
00:42:00.830 --> 00:42:03.260
<v Speaker 2>That's so scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A guy who does that ridiculous.</v>

1021
00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:05.630
<v Speaker 2>Especially a guy who's built like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean she.</v>

1022

<v Speaker 2>and 70 pounder I've ever seen anywhere.</v>

1023
00:42:10.930 --> 00:42:13.070

<v Speaker 2>the side here.</v>

1026
00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:20.750
<v Speaker 2>It's very similar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cro-Magnon,</v>

<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1030
00:42:28.401 --> 00:42:33.401
<v Speaker 2>he grabs a hold of one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like nine out of 10 someone's </v>

1031
00:42:33.401 --> 00:42:36.400
<v Speaker 2>tapping for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>except Alan Belcher beat the brakes off </v>

<v Speaker 2>belts or beat the British.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>

1033
00:42:36.650 --> 00:42:41.650
<v Speaker 2>Did he do it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He he like willingly went into because </v>

1034
00:42:41.650 --> 00:42:44.510
<v Speaker 2>he worked in all of it and just post </v>
<v Speaker 2>them in the face to face.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Sat on top,</v>
<v Speaker 2>punch pass.</v>

1036
00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:51.670
<v Speaker 2>I should ask Alan and give props to </v>
<v Speaker 2>whoever coached him on his leg locks </v>

1037
00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:56.201

<v Speaker 2>but Alan Belcher is a wizard at that </v>

1038
00:42:56.201 --> 00:42:58.571
<v Speaker 2>shit now because he prepared for that </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight and did everything every step of </v>

1039
00:42:58.571 --> 00:42:58.940
<v Speaker 2>the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like everything blocked.</v>

1040
00:42:58.941 --> 00:43:02.100
<v Speaker 2>Everything knew exactly what to expect </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can see Paul,</v>

1041
00:43:02.101 --> 00:43:05.330
<v Speaker 2>her was just so flustered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He really didn't know what to do because</v>

1042
00:43:05.331 --> 00:43:10.331
<v Speaker 2>Alan was like in right where he wanted </v>
<v Speaker 2>in this spiderweb defending everything </v>

1043
00:43:10.331 --> 00:43:11.060
<v Speaker 2>and then punching him in his face.</v>

1044
00:43:11.450 --> 00:43:15.410
<v Speaker 2>He says a little bit of an issue like do</v>
<v Speaker 2>there nate Marquardt when?</v>

1045
00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:17.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they pulled out the leg submission.</v>

1046
00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:18.540
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

1047
00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:23.740
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then Bam blasted in the face while </v>

1048
00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:26.070
<v Speaker 2>he was accusing native greasing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Leave that nate got out of his.</v>

1049
00:43:26.570 --> 00:43:26.930
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nate,</v>

1050
00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:29.000
<v Speaker 2>nate was pretty honest about what he </v>
<v Speaker 2>did.</v>

1051
00:43:29.001 --> 00:43:33.350
<v Speaker 2>He said I warmed up a lot because I knew</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy was a really good at leg locks.</v>

1052
00:43:33.351 --> 00:43:35.510
<v Speaker 2>I want it to be nice and slippery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I sweat a lot.</v>

1053
00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:37.610
<v Speaker 2>You're allowed to do that for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1054
00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:39.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's no issue with that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's like,</v>

1055
00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:40.490
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

1056
00:43:40.491 --> 00:43:41.720
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as he's pointing,</v>

1057
00:43:41.721 --> 00:43:44.900
<v Speaker 2>Nico's just dove on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was great.</v>

1058
00:43:44.901 --> 00:43:49.901
<v Speaker 2>What do you remember that fight?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He fought Dan Miller and jumped up on </v>

1059
00:43:49.901 --> 00:43:53.741
<v Speaker 2>the catch and hit him and rocked him and</v>
<v Speaker 2>for whatever reason decided to fight was</v>

1060
00:43:53.901 --> 00:43:54.290
<v Speaker 2>over.</v>

1061
00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:59.560
<v Speaker 2>So he starts celebrating Pars case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They pull them down from the cage.</v>

1062
00:43:59.570 --> 00:44:01.940
<v Speaker 2>The referees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fight still on like you have to keep</v>

1063
00:44:01.941 --> 00:44:03.560
<v Speaker 2>fighting like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1064
00:44:03.561 --> 00:44:05.360
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like did he end up winning?</v>

1065
00:44:05.540 --> 00:44:08.870
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you want to sit decision,</v>

1066
00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:11.150
<v Speaker 2>but it was one of the weirdest things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that embarrassing.</v>

1067
00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:16.180
<v Speaker 2>It's like he just decided to referee </v>
<v Speaker 2>stop real mccastle jumping up on the </v>

1068
00:44:16.180 --> 00:44:17.130
<v Speaker 2>cage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1069
00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:18.740
<v Speaker 2>they're literally grabbing his shorts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Were like,</v>

1070
00:44:18.741 --> 00:44:19.190
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you owe me.</v>

1071
00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:21.170
<v Speaker 2>You're still going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Paul hired.</v>

1072
00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:23.330
<v Speaker 2>Pull that up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Paul Harris versus Dan Miller.</v>

1073
00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:25.510
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well if you could find it,</v>

1074
00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:26.220
<v Speaker 2>find the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1075
00:44:26.260 --> 00:44:28.940
<v Speaker 2>the exchange because it's so bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sweep.</v>

1076
00:44:29.140 --> 00:44:34.140
<v Speaker 2>He has an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously if you hear you read about </v>

1077
00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:34.140
<v Speaker 2>that guys,</v>

1078
00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:37.100
<v Speaker 1>childhood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was one of the most horrific </v>

1079
00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:37.100
<v Speaker 1>childhoods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1080
00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:37.100
<v Speaker 1>that's it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1081
00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:39.270
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that look like he walks away.</v>

1082
00:44:39.390 --> 00:44:41.190
<v Speaker 1>He's on the cage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to tear them down.</v>

1083
00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:44.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at the finish again.</v>

1084
00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:49.080
<v Speaker 1>Watch how muscular he is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dan Miller going to do it all the way </v>

1085
00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:51.210
<v Speaker 1>back to the beginning so we can see what</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened before.</v>

1086
00:44:51.211 --> 00:44:53.190
<v Speaker 1>So he hits him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had some boom,</v>

1087
00:44:53.191 --> 00:44:54.840
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he just got,</v>

1088
00:44:55.100 --> 00:44:59.220
<v Speaker 1>he just decided.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just decided,</v>

1089
00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:01.730
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I live out.</v>

1090
00:45:01.731 --> 00:45:04.260
<v Speaker 1>Dan Miller's rushing over to them to </v>
<v Speaker 1>grab him on the cage.</v>

1091
00:45:04.650 --> 00:45:06.900
<v Speaker 1>What was he going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just those arms are.</v>

1092
00:45:06.930 --> 00:45:09.480
<v Speaker 1>So what does he weigh in there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

1093
00:45:09.481 --> 00:45:10.350
<v Speaker 1>80 five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1094
00:45:10.351 --> 00:45:12.270
<v Speaker 1>he weighed in at one 85.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's probably,</v>

1095
00:45:12.271 --> 00:45:13.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two plus.</v>

1096
00:45:13.590 --> 00:45:15.520
<v Speaker 1>His nickname means tree stump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1097
00:45:15.650 --> 00:45:18.860
<v Speaker 1>And this one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's terrible.</v>

1098
00:45:19.310 --> 00:45:20.090
<v Speaker 1>Carl and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1099
00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:21.180
<v Speaker 1>his childhood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1100
00:45:21.190 --> 00:45:21.550
<v Speaker 1>his trial.</v>

1101
00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:24.570
<v Speaker 1>It was unbelievably horrific when he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>working.</v>

1102
00:45:24.571 --> 00:45:29.571
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's working on a farm when he was a </v>

1103
00:45:29.571 --> 00:45:29.571
<v Speaker 1>little boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they eat pig slop,</v>

1104
00:45:29.571 --> 00:45:30.550
<v Speaker 1>like he literally had a pig slop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to stay alive.</v>

1105
00:45:30.551 --> 00:45:32.850
<v Speaker 1>We had no food when he first started </v>
<v Speaker 1>training,</v>

1106
00:45:32.851 --> 00:45:36.120
<v Speaker 1>he was just dirt poor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as poor as can be.</v>

1107
00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:41.780
<v Speaker 1>This big scar on his chest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they couldn't afford to take them </v>

1108
00:45:41.780 --> 00:45:43.050
<v Speaker 1>to a hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they glued it it like a giant gash on</v>

1109
00:45:43.051 --> 00:45:45.950
<v Speaker 1>his chest and they glued it together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1110
00:45:45.951 --> 00:45:47.730
<v Speaker 1>and when he was a little kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he,</v>

1111
00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:52.760
<v Speaker 1>he lived a hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard life probably filled with trauma </v>

1112
00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:56.961
<v Speaker 1>that people like us that grew up in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>nice neighborhood probably could never </v>

1113
00:45:56.961 --> 00:45:57.360
<v Speaker 1>understand again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kenny and Malibu,</v>

1114
00:45:57.361 --> 00:45:58.250
<v Speaker 1>who wants to fight?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1115
00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:03.280
<v Speaker 1>Macklin screwed bud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paul Harvey's is Super Glue in his ankle</v>

1116
00:46:03.841 --> 00:46:05.880
<v Speaker 1>walking pigs when he was eight years </v>
<v Speaker 1>old.</v>

1117
00:46:06.270 --> 00:46:07.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well we're talking.</v>

1118
00:46:07.100 --> 00:46:12.100
<v Speaker 1>We might've been talking about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was that before the podcast or was it </v>

1119
00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:12.100
<v Speaker 1>during the commercial?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we were saying that,</v>

1120
00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:16.670
<v Speaker 1>but it's the epigenetics thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientists have proven that fear and </v>

1121
00:46:16.670 --> 00:46:18.690
<v Speaker 1>memory can be inherited via sperm and </v>
<v Speaker 1>know that when did that,</v>

1122
00:46:18.691 --> 00:46:19.590
<v Speaker 1>when did they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when did they.</v>

1123
00:46:19.591 --> 00:46:21.180
<v Speaker 1>It's been a while,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

1124
00:46:21.210 --> 00:46:26.210
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's papers that have been published </v>

1125
00:46:26.210 --> 00:46:28.401
<v Speaker 1>on it now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently researches began testing the </v>

1126
00:46:28.401 --> 00:46:31.581
<v Speaker 1>pups of traumatized dad's for a startle </v>
<v Speaker 1>response to different smells.</v>

1127
00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:37.160
<v Speaker 1>The assetto Fino don't settle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fino and stimulus had a big effect which</v>

1128
00:46:38.401 --> 00:46:41.430
<v Speaker 1>was not seen in the controls to </v>
<v Speaker 1>emphasize here.</v>

1129
00:46:41.431 --> 00:46:46.431
<v Speaker 1>These pups never actually learned any </v>
<v Speaker 1>previous foot shock trials to the set of</v>

1130
00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:51.100
<v Speaker 1>phone that the phone was bad news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess that was evolutionarily though,</v>

1131
00:46:51.101 --> 00:46:52.470
<v Speaker 1>because remember Steve?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1132
00:46:52.471 --> 00:46:57.471
<v Speaker 1>because Steven Rinella said you start </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting and area the animals like the </v>

1133
00:46:57.471 --> 00:46:59.060
<v Speaker 1>elk in yellowstone because the wolves </v>
<v Speaker 1>are just introduced.</v>

1134
00:46:59.110 --> 00:47:01.770
<v Speaker 1>Their generation to generations have not</v>
<v Speaker 1>had to deal with wolves.</v>

1135
00:47:02.010 --> 00:47:05.730
<v Speaker 1>So what happens is they don't really </v>
<v Speaker 1>know how to defend against wolves.</v>

1136
00:47:05.731 --> 00:47:10.731
<v Speaker 1>They don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have the built in several </v>

1137
00:47:10.731 --> 00:47:10.731
<v Speaker 1>responses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>etc.</v>

1138
00:47:10.731 --> 00:47:11.670
<v Speaker 1>But as they start getting killed by </v>
<v Speaker 1>wolves,</v>

1139
00:47:11.671 --> 00:47:14.670
<v Speaker 1>more and more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their offspring will learn and it.</v>

1140
00:47:14.671 --> 00:47:16.770
<v Speaker 1>So it makes total sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is what happened.</v>

1141
00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:21.800
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they use the smell of this chemical </v>

1142
00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:24.261
<v Speaker 1>which has a citrusy smell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called a cdot finos and it was </v>

1143
00:47:24.721 --> 00:47:28.680
<v Speaker 1>paired with a slightly discomforting </v>
<v Speaker 1>electric shock to their feet.</v>

1144
00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:30.040
<v Speaker 1>So that's what they did to</v>

1145
00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:35.040
<v Speaker 2>the dads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they gave the children of the dads </v>

1146
00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:37.900
<v Speaker 2>this set of fino and spray and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>panicked.</v>

1147
00:47:38.830 --> 00:47:40.840
<v Speaker 2>This is rats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mice,</v>

1148
00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:41.410
<v Speaker 2>mice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1149
00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:43.690
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's some insane shit,</v>

1150
00:47:43.691 --> 00:47:48.691
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just joB is that whose job was </v>

1151
00:47:48.691 --> 00:47:48.920
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1152
00:47:48.921 --> 00:47:50.830
<v Speaker 2>you get the rats grabbed their feet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1153
00:47:50.890 --> 00:47:52.410
<v Speaker 2>Who was doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1154
00:47:52.450 --> 00:47:54.960
<v Speaker 2>that's given these rat that.</v>

1168
00:48:25.150 --> 00:48:28.240
<v Speaker 2>It's not awful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want anybody who's really skinny</v>

1169
00:48:28.241 --> 00:48:29.470
<v Speaker 2>to feel bad.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1176
00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:46.360
<v Speaker 2>I've never met a guy who just signed me </v>
<v Speaker 2>up for that skinny ass model.</v>

<v Speaker 2>to be that skinny guys don't like that.</v>

1179
00:48:52.300 --> 00:48:54.730
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's gay guys who are fashion designers.</v>

1180
00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:56.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying this trait cars aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of them are gay.</v>

1181
00:48:56.501 --> 00:48:58.600
<v Speaker 2>Let's be real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not homophobic to be honest.</v>

1182
00:48:59.530 --> 00:49:01.570
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of gay guys that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1183
00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:04.120
<v Speaker 2>obviously they're not looking for hips </v>
<v Speaker 2>to weight ratio.</v>

1184
00:49:04.330 --> 00:49:08.650
<v Speaker 2>Waist ratio asked to waist ratio because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not thinking about fucking them,</v>

1185
00:49:08.750 --> 00:49:10.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they like sledding,</v>

1186
00:49:11.980 --> 00:49:14.360

<v Speaker 2>hanger.</v>

1188
00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:21.840
<v Speaker 2>If we could get a chick to be that </v>
<v Speaker 2>skinny and thin so it'll look just like </v>

1189
00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:22.770
<v Speaker 2>that and then toss the blonde wig.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1190
00:49:23.660 --> 00:49:24.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Women decide that.</v>

1194
00:49:30.821 --> 00:49:32.620
<v Speaker 2>Women who looked like that look good </v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's the dna genetic,</v>

1207
00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:02.260
<v Speaker 2>but there's the cultural route.</v>

<v Speaker 3>we don't have any more because you lost </v>
<v Speaker 3>them all.</v>

1270
00:52:52.220 --> 00:52:57.220
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I told this story of my past three </v>

1271
00:52:57.220 --> 00:52:57.660
<v Speaker 3>different point I'm making is that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>found a guy who had an arsenal he had an</v>

1272
00:52:57.720 --> 00:53:01.290
<v Speaker 3>art show have to do with chicks and </v>
<v Speaker 3>shooting about shooting gun.</v>

1273
00:53:01.291 --> 00:53:06.291
<v Speaker 3>Same thing when you have a lot of ammo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had crazy amounts of ammo and all </v>

1274
00:53:06.291 --> 00:53:08.390
<v Speaker 3>kinds of machine guns and I said I </v>
<v Speaker 3>couldn't.</v>

1275
00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:11.830
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't squeeze off enough rounds </v>
<v Speaker 3>like day after day kick,</v>

1276
00:53:11.850 --> 00:53:12.240
<v Speaker 3>kick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kick,</v>

1277
00:53:12.241 --> 00:53:14.100
<v Speaker 3>kick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I became completely desensitized.</v>

1278
00:53:14.101 --> 00:53:15.240
<v Speaker 3>I was trying to shoot everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1279
00:53:15.390 --> 00:53:17.280
<v Speaker 3>what's that thing in the water?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that an otter?</v>

1280
00:53:17.340 --> 00:53:19.230
<v Speaker 3>That's very different than what we were </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about,</v>

1281
00:53:19.231 --> 00:53:21.510
<v Speaker 3>but I see why you can see what you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying.</v>

1282
00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:24.590
<v Speaker 3>See what type of bad correlation you </v>
<v Speaker 3>were talking about.</v>

1283
00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:26.090
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw</v>

1284
00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:28.240
<v Speaker 1>a report where they say some guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>

1285
00:53:28.290 --> 00:53:29.910
<v Speaker 1>what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who is that is?</v>

1286
00:53:29.911 --> 00:53:32.160
<v Speaker 1>I can sign me up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1287
00:53:32.161 --> 00:53:34.770
<v Speaker 1>Is that a real ass?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you sure?</v>

1288
00:53:35.220 --> 00:53:37.410
<v Speaker 1>Are you sure you showed that hasn't been</v>
<v Speaker 1>pumped up.</v>

1289
00:53:37.870 --> 00:53:38.550
<v Speaker 1>Yay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1290
00:53:38.580 --> 00:53:39.870
<v Speaker 1>guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care.</v>

1291
00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:43.140
<v Speaker 1>I do not care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1292
00:53:44.910 --> 00:53:46.180
<v Speaker 1>This is my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

1293
00:53:46.590 --> 00:53:47.640
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is welby?</v>

1294
00:53:47.670 --> 00:53:49.500
<v Speaker 1>Let's make it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's probably not even real.</v>

1295
00:53:49.710 --> 00:53:53.310
<v Speaker 1>Life is probably a gigantic </v>
<v Speaker 1>hallucination in the first place.</v>

1296
00:53:53.340 --> 00:53:54.040
<v Speaker 1>Hologram?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1297
00:53:54.060 --> 00:53:59.060
<v Speaker 1>Some sort of mathematical program from </v>
<v Speaker 1>space where we're on some computer </v>

1298
00:53:59.060 --> 00:53:59.490
<v Speaker 1>simulation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if that is the case,</v>

1299
00:53:59.491 --> 00:54:04.491
<v Speaker 1>you creating essentially everything with</v>
<v Speaker 1>your imagination that exists all around </v>

1300
00:54:04.491 --> 00:54:07.401
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're literally live the </v>

1301
00:54:07.401 --> 00:54:07.730
<v Speaker 1>point I was a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw,</v>

1302
00:54:07.770 --> 00:54:12.770
<v Speaker 1>I saw a report where it says you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>test trail where some guys are wired </v>

1303
00:54:12.770 --> 00:54:15.000
<v Speaker 1>where they just can't be faithful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just not wired to be monogamous.</v>

1304
00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:20.000
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if that has anything to do with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same thing that they're talking </v>

1305
00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:23.061
<v Speaker 1>about in this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this story with a sperm being </v>

1306
00:54:23.061 --> 00:54:26.541
<v Speaker 1>transferred from father to son.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if that's the case with um,</v>

1307
00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:32.300
<v Speaker 1>because there's some things that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>say like the children of racists are </v>

1308
00:54:32.300 --> 00:54:34.440
<v Speaker 1>almost inherently racist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not inherently racist,</v>

1309
00:54:34.441 --> 00:54:36.630
<v Speaker 1>like unavoidably so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or they can't learn,</v>

1310
00:54:36.780 --> 00:54:41.780
<v Speaker 1>but they will tend to show racist </v>
<v Speaker 1>tendencies more likely than someone who </v>

1311
00:54:41.780 --> 00:54:43.380
<v Speaker 1>was an adopted child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If someone who wasn't racist,</v>

1312
00:54:43.410 --> 00:54:44.670
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1313
00:54:44.671 --> 00:54:49.671
<v Speaker 1>I think they're trying now to figure out</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly what makeS a human being.</v>

1314
00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:52.680
<v Speaker 1>We don't know yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you see something like this with</v>

1315
00:54:52.681 --> 00:54:57.681
<v Speaker 1>mice and you gotta think what's more </v>
<v Speaker 1>complex and mice or person or persons </v>

1316
00:54:57.681 --> 00:55:01.910
<v Speaker 1>way more fucking complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if the underlying mechanisms like </v>

1317
00:55:01.910 --> 00:55:05.691
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what they're talking about in mice </v>

1318
00:55:05.691 --> 00:55:05.691
<v Speaker 1>does nothing for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't because it would.</v>

1319
00:55:05.691 --> 00:55:09.980
<v Speaker 1>If you were a guy and you got mugged by </v>
<v Speaker 1>a black guy and a black guy beat the </v>

1320
00:55:09.980 --> 00:55:13.551
<v Speaker 1>shit out of you and took your wallet and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you had a kid and your kid just </v>

1321
00:55:13.551 --> 00:55:14.220
<v Speaker 1>fucking shrieks every time it sees black</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1322
00:55:15.180 --> 00:55:20.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean That is real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the same mechanism that would </v>

1323
00:55:20.180 --> 00:55:24.050
<v Speaker 1>keep a look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a reason why rupert sheldrake </v>

1324
00:55:24.050 --> 00:55:24.630
<v Speaker 1>had this analogy about a kids and </v>
<v Speaker 1>monsters,</v>

1325
00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:27.030
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is every kid afraid of a monster?</v>

1326
00:55:27.031 --> 00:55:32.031
<v Speaker 1>Even a kid who grows up in New York city</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you should be afraid of car </v>

1327
00:55:32.031 --> 00:55:32.031
<v Speaker 1>accidents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1328
00:55:32.031 --> 00:55:35.870
<v Speaker 1>You should be afraid of floods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should be afraid of shit that's </v>

1329
00:55:35.870 --> 00:55:38.151
<v Speaker 1>real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but kids are afraid of a monster in the </v>

1330
00:55:38.151 --> 00:55:38.151
<v Speaker 1>dark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

1331
00:55:38.151 --> 00:55:38.910
<v Speaker 1>Because our ancestors get eaten by </v>
<v Speaker 1>jaguars.</v>

1332
00:55:39.150 --> 00:55:40.530
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we saw way,</v>

1333
00:55:40.531 --> 00:55:43.230
<v Speaker 1>way back in the day before they figured </v>
<v Speaker 1>out houses and spears,</v>

1334
00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:47.160
<v Speaker 1>all that come made the people of today </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all that stuff's in there.</v>

1335
00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:49.140
<v Speaker 1>That's why some people have a video </v>
<v Speaker 1>phobia.</v>

1336
00:55:49.350 --> 00:55:54.350
<v Speaker 1>Some people have arachnophobia they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>afraid of snakes or they're aFraid of </v>

1337
00:55:54.350 --> 00:55:54.420
<v Speaker 1>spiders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it is fucking paralyzing.</v>

1338
00:55:54.421 --> 00:55:57.120
<v Speaker 1>If you've ever seen from an evolutionary</v>
<v Speaker 1>point of view of the state in this book,</v>

1339
00:55:57.210 --> 00:56:00.000
<v Speaker 1>why evolution is true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are people afraid of snakes?</v>

1340
00:56:00.150 --> 00:56:03.390
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of people inherently from all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all over the place,</v>

1341
00:56:03.391 --> 00:56:05.450
<v Speaker 1>are afraid of snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>you take a fake snake on.</v>

1342
00:56:05.490 --> 00:56:09.390
<v Speaker 1>They've done these experiments right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where people are killed by cars way more</v>

1343
00:56:09.391 --> 00:56:10.560
<v Speaker 1>often.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

1344
00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:11.970
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>primates,</v>

1345
00:56:12.150 --> 00:56:14.910
<v Speaker 1>when they see a snake will climb a tree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost like they're afraid of snakes,</v>

1346
00:56:14.970 --> 00:56:16.830
<v Speaker 1>so they think it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think it's.</v>

1347
00:56:16.831 --> 00:56:19.230
<v Speaker 1>That's why they're still here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think it's an evolutionary memory.</v>

1348
00:56:19.460 --> 00:56:20.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1349
00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:22.730
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that human beings have carried from when</v>

1350
00:56:22.750 --> 00:56:23.650
<v Speaker 1>you know back back,</v>

1351
00:56:24.250 --> 00:56:29.250
<v Speaker 2>really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did a whole fucking research where </v>

1352
00:56:29.250 --> 00:56:31.640
<v Speaker 2>a guy listened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Snakes are scary as share reason though.</v>

1353
00:56:35.950 --> 00:56:40.360
<v Speaker 2>I know he's panicking for a car wreck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1354
00:56:40.390 --> 00:56:43.480
<v Speaker 2>You got into this thing where you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to anti intellectualize the whole</v>

1355
00:56:43.481 --> 00:56:45.710
<v Speaker 2>situation and you like this is your </v>
<v Speaker 2>watch.</v>

1356
00:56:45.720 --> 00:56:46.200
<v Speaker 2>Esco.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1357
00:56:46.210 --> 00:56:47.050
<v Speaker 2>not at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

1358
00:56:47.110 --> 00:56:51.710
<v Speaker 2>Not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1359
00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:56.760
<v Speaker 2>not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a reason because a rattle snake </v>

1360
00:56:56.760 --> 00:56:56.760
<v Speaker 2>will bite you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>correct.</v>

1361
00:56:56.760 --> 00:56:56.950
<v Speaker 2>Shake his sale,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bite you.</v>

1362
00:56:57.210 --> 00:57:01.840
<v Speaker 2>How often have you seen ralph not even </v>
<v Speaker 2>know that I don't even know that name.</v>

1363
00:57:01.870 --> 00:57:02.650
<v Speaker 2>Date.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Declamatory.</v>

1364
00:57:03.130 --> 00:57:05.620
<v Speaker 2>Almost immediately they see when they </v>
<v Speaker 2>bite you.</v>

1365
00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:10.680
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they don't know that we're talking </v>

1366
00:57:10.680 --> 00:57:10.680
<v Speaker 2>about things that have never been </v>
<v Speaker 2>exposed to snakes.</v>

1367
00:57:10.680 --> 00:57:12.040
<v Speaker 2>They don't have a book to read.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People that don't have videos to watch.</v>

1368
00:57:12.370 --> 00:57:13.330
<v Speaker 2>Just see us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1369
00:57:13.930 --> 00:57:18.930
<v Speaker 2>I saY see a snake with these huge things</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they don't know what that thing is.</v>

1370
00:57:19.331 --> 00:57:22.870
<v Speaker 2>It looks like a stick that people have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't touch a snake.</v>

1371
00:57:25.160 --> 00:57:30.160
<v Speaker 2>monkey of common sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brennan one sense reminiscences most </v>

1372
00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:31.110
<v Speaker 2>likely rented common sense was be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1373
00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:36.120
<v Speaker 2>be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Be afraid way more afraid of cars </v>

1374
00:57:36.120 --> 00:57:36.120
<v Speaker 2>because they kill way more people a </v>
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>

1375
00:57:36.120 --> 00:57:36.120
<v Speaker 2>Then do snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1376
00:57:36.120 --> 00:57:38.590
<v Speaker 2>But people we know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know cars.</v>

1377
00:57:38.650 --> 00:57:39.520
<v Speaker 2>People.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No snakes.</v>

1378
00:57:39.790 --> 00:57:42.520
<v Speaker 2>Not really what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why we're terrifying.</v>

1379
00:57:42.570 --> 00:57:44.830
<v Speaker 2>What are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>People don't know.</v>

1380
00:57:44.831 --> 00:57:45.880
<v Speaker 2>Snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1381
00:57:45.881 --> 00:57:47.290
<v Speaker 2>they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wait a minute.</v>

1382
00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:50.020
<v Speaker 2>Come on man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People don't know what a snake is.</v>

1383
00:57:50.730 --> 00:57:53.950
<v Speaker 2>Saw snakes taking my yard two days ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1384
00:57:53.980 --> 00:57:56.470
<v Speaker 2>good for you joe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You around rattle snakes all the time,</v>

1385
00:57:56.500 --> 00:57:59.080
<v Speaker 2>but everybody has an la la.</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have a yard,</v>

1386
00:57:59.310 --> 00:58:03.500
<v Speaker 2>it's very possible that snakes are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't know how many routes.</v>

1387
00:58:03.510 --> 00:58:08.510
<v Speaker 2>Thanks sir.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Zero rattle snake in your car.</v>

1388
00:58:09.190 --> 00:58:11.750
<v Speaker 2>Trust me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might not see a rattlesnake,</v>

1389
00:58:11.770 --> 00:58:16.770
<v Speaker 2>but they're out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's probably a very small </v>

1390
00:58:16.770 --> 00:58:16.770
<v Speaker 2>population in your neighborhood there.</v>

1391
00:58:16.770 --> 00:58:17.860
<v Speaker 2>The poInt I'm making is you're missing </v>
<v Speaker 2>the point.</v>

1392
00:58:17.861 --> 00:58:19.390
<v Speaker 2>Evolutionary scientists have to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

1393
00:58:19.391 --> 00:58:22.450
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've realized that we have a natural and</v>

1394
00:58:22.510 --> 00:58:27.510
<v Speaker 2>a human being seemed to have universally</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a phobia of snakes and things.</v>

1395
00:58:28.290 --> 00:58:29.160
<v Speaker 2>Hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hold on,</v>

1396
00:58:29.480 --> 00:58:30.320
<v Speaker 2>hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hold on,</v>

1397
00:58:30.760 --> 00:58:33.520
<v Speaker 2>hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have a natural phobia of snakes and</v>

1398
00:58:33.521 --> 00:58:36.040
<v Speaker 2>what that is probably as an evolutionary</v>
<v Speaker 2>memory,</v>

1399
00:58:36.041 --> 00:58:41.041
<v Speaker 2>and I'm talking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>joe was talking about how you have you </v>

1400
00:58:41.041 --> 00:58:43.930
<v Speaker 2>create fear memory through generations </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that is an example of that.</v>

1401
00:58:44.170 --> 00:58:46.040
<v Speaker 2>Whether or not you know you're afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Snakes.</v>

1402
00:58:46.041 --> 00:58:49.360
<v Speaker 2>What the point is is that there are </v>
<v Speaker 2>other things in life you could be.</v>

1403
00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:54.480
<v Speaker 2>You should be way more afraid of him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are not because we don't have as </v>

1404
00:58:54.480 --> 00:58:57.181
<v Speaker 2>long a memory of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's the argument from the </v>

1405
00:58:57.181 --> 00:58:57.370
<v Speaker 2>argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get both arguments then.</v>

1406
00:58:57.371 --> 00:58:59.800
<v Speaker 2>Why are people scared of aliens?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1407
00:58:59.801 --> 00:59:04.801
<v Speaker 2>because they're scared of the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not just only scared of things </v>

1408
00:59:04.801 --> 00:59:06.580
<v Speaker 2>that we see that are scary because our </v>
<v Speaker 2>grandfathers got bitten by one.</v>

1409
00:59:06.581 --> 00:59:09.340
<v Speaker 2>We're also scared of the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're scared of the dark period.</v>

1410
00:59:09.341 --> 00:59:11.530
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a good theory for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it makes sense,</v>

1411
00:59:11.531 --> 00:59:12.910
<v Speaker 2>but I think there's also some things </v>
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>

1412
00:59:12.911 --> 00:59:13.960
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1413
00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:16.300
<v Speaker 2>if a predator walks in my room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm be like,</v>

1414
00:59:16.301 --> 00:59:17.230
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's up?</v>

1415
00:59:17.231 --> 00:59:18.280
<v Speaker 2>Let's hang out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1416
00:59:18.390 --> 00:59:18.610
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1417
00:59:18.670 --> 00:59:21.590
<v Speaker 2>My children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you go like this to children,</v>

1418
00:59:22.310 --> 00:59:24.800
<v Speaker 1>they start crying little babies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That scared me.</v>

1419
00:59:24.890 --> 00:59:29.890
<v Speaker 1>Why though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's a memory of being eaten to </v>

1420
00:59:29.890 --> 00:59:29.890
<v Speaker 1>memory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of being eaten.</v>

1421
00:59:29.890 --> 00:59:30.830
<v Speaker 1>So what they found is even infants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you go,</v>

1422
00:59:30.890 --> 00:59:33.140
<v Speaker 1>when you bury your teeth and go like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this with your hands,</v>

1423
00:59:33.650 --> 00:59:36.560
<v Speaker 1>you go and grout,</v>
<v Speaker 1>low noises for infants.</v>

1424
00:59:36.561 --> 00:59:39.560
<v Speaker 1>That's why when men come into a room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times children when they hear a</v>

1425
00:59:39.561 --> 00:59:44.561
<v Speaker 1>low voice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when the person's talking </v>

1426
00:59:44.561 --> 00:59:46.631
<v Speaker 1>loud man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they immediately are way more afraid of </v>

1427
00:59:46.631 --> 00:59:47.390
<v Speaker 1>that than they are of of a woman with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>high voice.</v>

1428
00:59:47.391 --> 00:59:49.430
<v Speaker 1>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why did they start crying?</v>

1429
00:59:49.431 --> 00:59:50.800
<v Speaker 1>It's strange men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a.</v>

1430
00:59:50.840 --> 00:59:53.600
<v Speaker 1>That is according to a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary biologist.</v>

1431
00:59:53.630 --> 00:59:56.960
<v Speaker 1>That is a memory that you were actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>born with.</v>

1432
00:59:57.050 --> 00:59:58.370
<v Speaker 1>Not in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's that called?</v>

1433
00:59:58.760 --> 00:59:59.480
<v Speaker 1>Instinct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1434
00:59:59.481 --> 01:00:04.481
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's the type of incident or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>babies are scared because the giant do </v>

1435
01:00:04.481 --> 01:00:04.481
<v Speaker 1>talking all loud.</v>

1436
01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:08.020
<v Speaker 1>You just chalk it up to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not afraid of teenagers.</v>

1437
01:00:08.110 --> 01:00:10.850
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>babies are afraid of a lot of shit.</v>

1438
01:00:10.851 --> 01:00:12.080
<v Speaker 1>They're afraid of things don't make </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>

1439
01:00:12.081 --> 01:00:14.240
<v Speaker 1>Like a ladies hat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fucking giant feathers.</v>

1440
01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:19.940
<v Speaker 1>They freak out because it's to get the </v>
<v Speaker 1>point you're making and I think it's </v>

1441
01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:21.290
<v Speaker 1>true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I also think sometimes you just know</v>

1442
01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:22.100
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I think?</v>

1443
01:00:22.101 --> 01:00:24.350
<v Speaker 1>I think it's not either or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's both,</v>

1444
01:00:24.510 --> 01:00:29.510
<v Speaker 1>but what they're saying in this study </v>
<v Speaker 1>and memorize what's been proven in this </v>

1445
01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:31.460
<v Speaker 1>study though is pretty unavoidable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're.</v>

1446
01:00:31.461 --> 01:00:36.461
<v Speaker 1>They're detecting this stress response </v>
<v Speaker 1>to a very specific smell that they've </v>

1447
01:00:36.461 --> 01:00:39.941
<v Speaker 1>created that they associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>electric shocks and then the the </v>

1448
01:00:39.941 --> 01:00:42.110
<v Speaker 1>children have that same reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty much proof,</v>

1449
01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:46.700
<v Speaker 1>but then how's this go back?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy being faithful was saying is the</v>

1450
01:00:46.701 --> 01:00:51.701
<v Speaker 1>same thing with racism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was saying that there's things that </v>

1451
01:00:51.701 --> 01:00:52.370
<v Speaker 1>are even useless.</v>

1452
01:00:52.370 --> 01:00:57.370
<v Speaker 1>Things that are passed on from </v>
<v Speaker 1>generation to generation and I think at </v>

1453
01:00:57.370 --> 01:01:01.541
<v Speaker 1>least at one point in time there was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>time where the human race has probably </v>

1454
01:01:01.701 --> 01:01:06.701
<v Speaker 1>in jeopardy and it was probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous for one guy to have sex with </v>

1455
01:01:07.311 --> 01:01:09.890
<v Speaker 1>one woman and hope that the race was </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to keep going.</v>

1456
01:01:10.190 --> 01:01:15.190
<v Speaker 1>Everybody fucked as much as they could </v>
<v Speaker 1>because half the babies got eaten by </v>

1457
01:01:15.190 --> 01:01:15.350
<v Speaker 1>jaguars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1458
01:01:15.351 --> 01:01:20.351
<v Speaker 1>what are the odds of a fleshy little </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking shitty designed human disease?</v>

1459
01:01:20.580 --> 01:01:24.320
<v Speaker 1>Survive animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wolves,</v>

1460
01:01:24.350 --> 01:01:27.950
<v Speaker 1>fucking everything you until you figure </v>
<v Speaker 1>out weapons.</v>

1461
01:01:27.951 --> 01:01:30.710
<v Speaker 1>Then you have to band together and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't work out.</v>

1462
01:01:30.980 --> 01:01:35.980
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a hard road for a long time for </v>

1463
01:01:35.980 --> 01:01:38.981
<v Speaker 1>people to make it this far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's so out of control that we're </v>

1464
01:01:38.981 --> 01:01:42.851
<v Speaker 1>overwhelming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The population is overwhelming the </v>

1465
01:01:42.851 --> 01:01:44.870
<v Speaker 1>resources of the planet and will </v>
<v Speaker 1>continue to grow at this rate or have an</v>

1466
01:01:44.871 --> 01:01:47.660
<v Speaker 1>exponential rate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a long time ago,</v>

1467
01:01:47.661 --> 01:01:49.550
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was tough to keep people alive.</v>

1468
01:01:49.970 --> 01:01:54.970
<v Speaker 1>During the roman times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a 50 percent infant mortality </v>

1469
01:01:54.970 --> 01:01:54.970
<v Speaker 1>rate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fifty percent.</v>

1470
01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.830
<v Speaker 1>If you had two kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of them was going to die for sure,</v>

1471
01:01:58.130 --> 01:02:03.130
<v Speaker 1>and you just had to deal with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just having sex with whoever it </v>

1472
01:02:03.130 --> 01:02:03.130
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

1473
01:02:03.130 --> 01:02:04.880
<v Speaker 1>They were mad dog in it because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were trying to keep the race alive.</v>

1474
01:02:05.060 --> 01:02:10.060
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that they found when </v>

1475
01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:10.130
<v Speaker 1>they were going over the dead sea </v>
<v Speaker 1>scrolls was that they,</v>

1476
01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:14.600
<v Speaker 1>the dead sea scrolls is the most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the oldest stories of the bible that are</v>

1477
01:02:14.601 --> 01:02:19.601
<v Speaker 1>known.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the only form of the bible that's </v>

1478
01:02:19.601 --> 01:02:22.001
<v Speaker 1>written in aramaic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they found that in these scrolls in </v>

1479
01:02:22.001 --> 01:02:25.300
<v Speaker 1>Iran,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was written on animal skins and left </v>

1480
01:02:25.300 --> 01:02:26.700
<v Speaker 1>in these caves and these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these ceramic pots.</v>

1481
01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:32.120
<v Speaker 1>They found that a big part of What they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were concerned with was fertility </v>

1482
01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:36.561
<v Speaker 1>rituals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were concerned with making sure </v>

1483
01:02:36.561 --> 01:02:37.260
<v Speaker 1>that they breed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making sure that they carry on.</v>

1484
01:02:37.470 --> 01:02:38.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

1485
01:02:38.290 --> 01:02:40.590
<v Speaker 1>we're talking like thousands and </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of years ago.</v>

1486
01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:42.750
<v Speaker 1>We.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's nothing though.</v>

1487
01:02:42.751 --> 01:02:47.751
<v Speaker 1>When you think about the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>humans in this form of essentially been </v>

1488
01:02:47.751 --> 01:02:50.601
<v Speaker 1>around for close to a million years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so for a long time it was a hard </v>

1489
01:02:50.601 --> 01:02:54.491
<v Speaker 1>scrabble life where we might not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>might not fucking make it and the only </v>

1490
01:02:54.491 --> 01:02:58.101
<v Speaker 1>way we could make it is if we protect </v>
<v Speaker 1>our territory and fuck every chick we </v>

1491
01:02:58.101 --> 01:03:00.480
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is shooting and to everybody.</v>

1492
01:03:00.481 --> 01:03:02.190
<v Speaker 1>So miguel was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's do this.</v>

1493
01:03:02.220 --> 01:03:04.980
<v Speaker 1>Those are the men that made it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the men that made it,</v>

1494
01:03:05.010 --> 01:03:08.460
<v Speaker 1>the humans that made it were the ones </v>
<v Speaker 1>that had this evolutionary trait.</v>

1495
01:03:08.570 --> 01:03:09.990
<v Speaker 1>And it conversely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

1496
01:03:09.991 --> 01:03:11.610
<v Speaker 1>and you're saying that trades carried </v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

1497
01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:13.500
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that trade exists in primates,</v>

1498
01:03:14.150 --> 01:03:15.870
<v Speaker 1>but not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it'll all.</v>

1499
01:03:15.930 --> 01:03:20.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't think to all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess some still have it know it </v>

1500
01:03:20.930 --> 01:03:20.930
<v Speaker 1>exists in all primates.</v>

1501
01:03:20.930 --> 01:03:24.860
<v Speaker 1>Every single primary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only primate that it's ever been </v>

1502
01:03:24.860 --> 01:03:26.220
<v Speaker 1>observed to even try to be monogamous as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a human being.</v>

1503
01:03:26.430 --> 01:03:31.430
<v Speaker 1>All the monkeys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gorillas have harems and the </v>

1504
01:03:31.430 --> 01:03:33.750
<v Speaker 1>gorillas have such a domination over the</v>
<v Speaker 1>females that the females never cheat.</v>

1505
01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:35.340
<v Speaker 1>So because of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the grills,</v>

1506
01:03:35.341 --> 01:03:38.820
<v Speaker 1>dicks have shrunk the size of an inch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gorillas have tiny,</v>

1507
01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:44.960
<v Speaker 1>tiny little ball and the little chimp </v>
<v Speaker 1>pitches or whole ours chimps are sluts.</v>

1508
01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:48.180
<v Speaker 1>So chimps have giant balls and giant </v>
<v Speaker 1>eagle,</v>

1509
01:03:48.660 --> 01:03:52.230
<v Speaker 1>but not as big as humans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Human beings are the most promiscuous.</v>

1510
01:03:52.260 --> 01:03:57.260
<v Speaker 1>And there's a direct correlation between</v>
<v Speaker 1>female promiscuity and male testicular </v>

1511
01:03:57.260 --> 01:03:58.260
<v Speaker 1>size.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1512
01:03:58.261 --> 01:04:00.360
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bigger the balls,</v>

1513
01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:04.000
<v Speaker 1>the more likely the male is surrounded </v>
<v Speaker 1>by a bunch of hula.</v>

1514
01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:10.360
<v Speaker 1>The dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So your body recognizes this and the </v>

1515
01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:11.320
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The competition builds up so you,</v>

1516
01:04:11.321 --> 01:04:13.650
<v Speaker 1>you come more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you build up more.</v>

1517
01:04:13.790 --> 01:04:18.790
<v Speaker 1>There Was a bunch of faulty conclusion </v>
<v Speaker 1>reached by a book called sperm wars and </v>

1518
01:04:18.790 --> 01:04:22.881
<v Speaker 1>this book is basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of junk science attached </v>

1519
01:04:22.881 --> 01:04:25.941
<v Speaker 1>to it and a lot of it was about these </v>
<v Speaker 1>killer sperm that attacks sperm and </v>

1520
01:04:25.941 --> 01:04:29.931
<v Speaker 1>killed them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they've never been able to </v>

1521
01:04:29.931 --> 01:04:31.581
<v Speaker 1>conclusively prove that sperm have any </v>
<v Speaker 1>properties other than trying to get </v>

1522
01:04:31.581 --> 01:04:31.590
<v Speaker 1>someone pregnant.</v>

1523
01:04:31.740 --> 01:04:36.740
<v Speaker 1>There's never been proven that their </v>
<v Speaker 1>sperm that are attacking other sperm or </v>

1524
01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:38.580
<v Speaker 1>any mechanism which they kill the sperm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what it has been proven is your dick</v>

1525
01:04:38.581 --> 01:04:40.830
<v Speaker 1>is shaped a certain way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1526
01:04:40.831 --> 01:04:44.500
<v Speaker 1>And the big fat head at the end is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>goddamn plunger.</v>

1527
01:04:44.850 --> 01:04:48.220
<v Speaker 1>and like the evolutionary design,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a dude has got a little dickhead,</v>

1528
01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:51.360
<v Speaker 1>ever see a porn and the guy's got a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little head is poor bastard.</v>

1529
01:04:51.540 --> 01:04:52.500
<v Speaker 1>WhaT are you going to do with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing?</v>

1530
01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:55.140
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because evolutionary,</v>

1531
01:04:55.141 --> 01:04:58.920
<v Speaker 1>we look at that the same way we look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>a big ass or big tits.</v>

1532
01:04:58.921 --> 01:05:01.350
<v Speaker 1>Like that's not a good design.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like look at that little fat,</v>

1533
01:05:01.410 --> 01:05:03.570
<v Speaker 1>fat dick with a little head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a mess.</v>

1534
01:05:03.810 --> 01:05:06.110
<v Speaker 1>You're not plunging a can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>

1535
01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:06.950
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my girl,</v>

1536
01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:07.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not jealous.</v>

1537
01:05:07.981 --> 01:05:11.680
<v Speaker 1>You're plunging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'rE using this big fat dick head.</v>

1538
01:05:11.730 --> 01:05:16.730
<v Speaker 1>The bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the better to squirt out all the other </v>

1539
01:05:16.730 --> 01:05:17.100
<v Speaker 1>dudes sperm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then with the hood of the books.</v>

1540
01:05:17.300 --> 01:05:18.240
<v Speaker 1>Hooker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1541
01:05:18.250 --> 01:05:21.820
<v Speaker 2>It pulls it out and then you shoot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your own is intense.</v>

1542
01:05:21.850 --> 01:05:26.850
<v Speaker 2>It's intense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's the design of the human is </v>

1543
01:05:26.850 --> 01:05:26.980
<v Speaker 2>the plunger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1544
01:05:26.981 --> 01:05:28.880
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

1545
01:05:28.940 --> 01:05:31.050
<v Speaker 2>that's really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are there any anteaters in here?</v>

1546
01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:33.810
<v Speaker 2>Do you want to have a hood hanging over </v>
<v Speaker 2>me?</v>

1547
01:05:33.900 --> 01:05:38.320
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>believe it is as well and tortured,</v>

1548
01:05:38.321 --> 01:05:40.450
<v Speaker 2>but in england most of them have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hood.</v>

1549
01:05:40.451 --> 01:05:41.260
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1550
01:05:41.261 --> 01:05:46.261
<v Speaker 2>it should be because it's gentlemen </v>
<v Speaker 2>mutation really is because my coach tony</v>

1551
01:05:47.021 --> 01:05:49.270
<v Speaker 2>jeffries in santa monica,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's having a baby.</v>

1552
01:05:49.420 --> 01:05:49.960
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1553
01:05:49.961 --> 01:05:51.640
<v Speaker 2>if it's a boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to cut the hood off,</v>

1554
01:05:51.641 --> 01:05:53.150
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's weird to leave it on.</v>

1555
01:05:53.170 --> 01:05:54.820
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1556
01:05:54.940 --> 01:05:56.360
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who kissed her hood?</v>

1557
01:05:56.430 --> 01:05:57.640
<v Speaker 2>Off I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1558
01:05:57.940 --> 01:06:02.940
<v Speaker 2>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Haven't you ever seen the scene that </v>

1559
01:06:02.940 --> 01:06:03.790
<v Speaker 2>you're better at it can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No studies,</v>

1560
01:06:03.791 --> 01:06:08.460
<v Speaker 2>no studies whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All junk science shit under the,</v>

1561
01:06:08.580 --> 01:06:10.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of religious thing,</v>

1562
01:06:10.211 --> 01:06:10.480
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1563
01:06:10.540 --> 01:06:12.070
<v Speaker 2>They taught it a little bit of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>religious thing,</v>

1564
01:06:12.071 --> 01:06:17.071
<v Speaker 2>but it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that they're preparing for a </v>

1565
01:06:17.071 --> 01:06:19.561
<v Speaker 2>giant backlash of babies have had their </v>
<v Speaker 2>dick sliced because if circumcision was </v>

1566
01:06:19.561 --> 01:06:21.910
<v Speaker 2>proven to be genital mutilation and </v>
<v Speaker 2>stopped,</v>

1567
01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:25.840
<v Speaker 2>then guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You opened the door for suits.</v>

1568
01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:30.960
<v Speaker 2>If everybody just decides to go ape shit</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the american medical association or </v>

1569
01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:35.280
<v Speaker 2>anybody who allowed essentially a non </v>
<v Speaker 2>beneficial genital mutilation to norm to</v>

1570
01:06:36.821 --> 01:06:40.050
<v Speaker 2>be the norm or real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what kind of backlash?</v>

1571
01:06:40.060 --> 01:06:42.610
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not a propaganda or rather a,</v>

1572
01:06:42.611 --> 01:06:43.090
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1573
01:06:43.390 --> 01:06:44.950
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a conspiracy theory,</v>

1574
01:06:44.951 --> 01:06:46.540
<v Speaker 2>sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an idea.</v>

1575
01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:51.720
<v Speaker 2>This is the reality of what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Genital mutilation on a wide scale </v>

1576
01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:53.600
<v Speaker 2>that's completely unnecessary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that has no health benefits.</v>

1577
01:06:53.610 --> 01:06:55.660
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's weird is in a locked room,</v>

1578
01:06:55.661 --> 01:06:57.810
<v Speaker 2>nfl college locker room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you got a hood,</v>

1579
01:06:57.811 --> 01:06:58.720
<v Speaker 2>you were the outcast.</v>

1580
01:06:58.930 --> 01:07:01.060
<v Speaker 2>He made fun of your fund.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your dick.</v>

1581
01:07:01.090 --> 01:07:02.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but tony was saying england,</v>

1582
01:07:02.980 --> 01:07:05.290
<v Speaker 2>if you didn't have a hood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got made fun of.</v>

1583
01:07:05.350 --> 01:07:06.670
<v Speaker 2>I bet it's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1584
01:07:06.700 --> 01:07:07.750
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one's natural hair.</v>

1585
01:07:07.790 --> 01:07:08.890
<v Speaker 2>That's not right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1586
01:07:08.891 --> 01:07:13.891
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also about with the plates in the </v>

1587
01:07:13.891 --> 01:07:16.951
<v Speaker 2>lip and all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just whatever the culture decides </v>

1588
01:07:16.951 --> 01:07:19.681
<v Speaker 2>is the norm and the culture's decided </v>
<v Speaker 2>that cutting your dick to her house to </v>

1589
01:07:19.681 --> 01:07:24.410
<v Speaker 2>her of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have a better chance of not </v>

1590
01:07:24.410 --> 01:07:25.760
<v Speaker 2>contacting like a gonorrhea and things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's.</v>

1591
01:07:25.770 --> 01:07:30.400
<v Speaker 2>I think that's all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is no medical society in the world</v>

1592
01:07:30.401 --> 01:07:34.630
<v Speaker 2>that has recognized any real health </v>
<v Speaker 2>benefits to circumcision.</v>

1593
01:07:35.140 --> 01:07:37.540
<v Speaker 2>It's all bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not only that,</v>

1594
01:07:37.541 --> 01:07:39.850
<v Speaker 2>the risks include infection,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hemorrhage,</v>

1595
01:07:39.851 --> 01:07:41.860
<v Speaker 2>scarring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>difficulty urinating,</v>

1596
01:07:41.861 --> 01:07:45.130
<v Speaker 2>loss of part or all of the penis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and even death.</v>

1597
01:07:45.430 --> 01:07:50.430
<v Speaker 2>Circumcision complications can also and </v>
<v Speaker 2>do occur even if the best in the best </v>

1598
01:07:50.430 --> 01:07:55.141
<v Speaker 2>clinical settings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Early producers back in a little too </v>

1599
01:07:55.141 --> 01:07:55.141
<v Speaker 2>smiley.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1600
01:07:55.141 --> 01:07:58.050
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got some hoods that more than maybe </v>

1601
01:07:58.050 --> 01:08:02.430
<v Speaker 2>this decade has more than one baby has.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This decade has died in New York because</v>

1602
01:08:03.311 --> 01:08:05.070
<v Speaker 2>the rabbis who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1603
01:08:05.140 --> 01:08:10.090
<v Speaker 2>these really heavy religious jewish </v>
<v Speaker 2>dudes insist on using the moyle who uses</v>

1604
01:08:10.091 --> 01:08:15.091
<v Speaker 2>the traditional method of circumcision </v>
<v Speaker 2>where they circumcise the baby and then </v>

1605
01:08:15.091 --> 01:08:16.010
<v Speaker 2>suck his penis to stop the</v>

1606
01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:21.010
<v Speaker 1>bleeding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these rabbis have had herpes and </v>

1607
01:08:21.010 --> 01:08:24.311
<v Speaker 1>given her [inaudible] to the babies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they refused to stop this because this </v>

1608
01:08:24.311 --> 01:08:28.760
<v Speaker 1>is a religious procedure.</v>

<v Speaker 1>on animal skins and fucking chicken </v>
<v Speaker 1>scratch that you can't even read today,</v>

1621
01:09:02.390 --> 01:09:04.490
<v Speaker 1>and it says you could suck baby dicks.</v>

1622
01:09:04.670 --> 01:09:09.670
<v Speaker 1>You cut their dicks and then you suck </v>
<v Speaker 1>them in humanity if that didn't exist </v>

<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter like it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>to live for.</v>

1959
01:23:11.170 --> 01:23:13.660

<v Speaker 2>thing to do.</v>

1981
01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:03.010
<v Speaker 2>When I like clothes,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Never had a cap.</v>

2072
01:27:46.460 --> 01:27:48.740

2079
01:28:01.910 --> 01:28:04.430
<v Speaker 2>How about think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a weird response that is.</v>

2080
01:28:04.610 --> 01:28:09.610
<v Speaker 2>Normal shit for other people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a bag of peanuts given to some </v>

2081
01:28:09.610 --> 01:28:10.430
<v Speaker 2>people and it's death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2082
01:28:10.431 --> 01:28:15.431
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how about I was eating a lot of Brazil </v>

2083
01:28:15.431 --> 01:28:16.150
<v Speaker 2>nuts and then for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the my mouth.</v>

<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>not me.</v>

2086
01:28:18.290 --> 01:28:19.100
<v Speaker 2>Not me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get this.</v>

2087
01:28:19.130 --> 01:28:21.740
<v Speaker 2>The inside of my mouth would swell up to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the point where I was like,</v>

2088
01:28:21.770 --> 01:28:23.390
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is he inside of mouth?</v>

2089
01:28:23.391 --> 01:28:24.400
<v Speaker 2>Literally I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>

2090
01:28:24.460 --> 01:28:24.760
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

2091
01:28:25.240 --> 01:28:27.530
<v Speaker 2>And it got worse and worse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I was like,</v>

2092
01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:31.100
<v Speaker 2>what the hell is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my mother comes over and she goes,</v>

2093
01:28:31.670 --> 01:28:32.870
<v Speaker 2>those are Brazil nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

2094
01:28:32.871 --> 01:28:33.530
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She goes,</v>

2095
01:28:33.560 --> 01:28:35.390
<v Speaker 2>do you know if I eat one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would die.</v>

2096
01:28:36.370 --> 01:28:37.640
<v Speaker 2>And I went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean?</v>

2097
01:28:37.700 --> 01:28:39.850
<v Speaker 2>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't even eat.</v>

2098
01:28:39.920 --> 01:28:40.640
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2099
01:28:40.641 --> 01:28:45.641
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she ate half a Brazil nut that was in a </v>

2100
01:28:45.641 --> 01:28:45.641
<v Speaker 2>salad long time ago and she had to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>rushed to the hospital.</v>

2101
01:28:45.641 --> 01:28:46.040
<v Speaker 2>Why didn't this bitch tell you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2102
01:28:46.190 --> 01:28:51.190
<v Speaker 2>So what does that really mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm clearly alerted to Brazil nuts and I</v>

2103
01:28:53.431 --> 01:28:57.140
<v Speaker 2>was the wolfing down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean wolfing down at least partially.</v>

2104
01:28:57.200 --> 01:28:59.150
<v Speaker 2>You probably don't have it as bad as </v>
<v Speaker 2>her,</v>

2105
01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:00.650
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you lack,</v>

2106
01:29:00.690 --> 01:29:02.130
<v Speaker 2>I guess an enzyme for certain</v>

2107
01:29:02.130 --> 01:29:05.040
<v Speaker 1>nuts or whatever you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brazil nuts are high in zinc.</v>

2108
01:29:05.041 --> 01:29:10.041
<v Speaker 1>I have you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever had your bLood tested for </v>

2109
01:29:10.041 --> 01:29:10.041
<v Speaker 1>what you're allergic to?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to do my genome.</v>

2110
01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:15.200
<v Speaker 1>I did a whole diet where they test your </v>
<v Speaker 1>blood type to see what your lieutenants </v>

2111
01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:15.780
<v Speaker 1>that I'm allergic to egg yolk and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>really it.</v>

2112
01:29:16.530 --> 01:29:17.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nuts.</v>

2113
01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:18.560
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bruh,</v>

2114
01:29:18.580 --> 01:29:23.580
<v Speaker 1>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brazil nuts actually can increase your </v>

2115
01:29:23.580 --> 01:29:23.580
<v Speaker 1>testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I was eating them.</v>

2116
01:29:23.580 --> 01:29:25.440
<v Speaker 1>My trainer told me to take them in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>shake.</v>

2117
01:29:25.500 --> 01:29:30.500
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mass amount of them are lIke super </v>

2118
01:29:30.500 --> 01:29:34.941
<v Speaker 1>fucking healthy for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says a salinium apparently.</v>

2119
01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:38.580
<v Speaker 1>Also it helps lower your ldl or bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>cholesterol,</v>

2120
01:29:38.581 --> 01:29:41.250
<v Speaker 1>reduces the Incidence of blood clots in </v>
<v Speaker 1>heart disease.</v>

2121
01:29:41.610 --> 01:29:45.060
<v Speaker 1>If I eat a shitload of brazilian nuts or</v>
<v Speaker 1>they need a lot of nuts,</v>

2122
01:29:45.090 --> 01:29:49.290
<v Speaker 1>brendan tested positive for Brazil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Says here they actually caution limiting</v>

2123
01:29:49.291 --> 01:29:54.291
<v Speaker 1>yourself to no more than two Brazil nuts</v>
<v Speaker 1>per day because they are so loaded and </v>

2124
01:29:54.291 --> 01:29:56.640
<v Speaker 1>concentrated with millennium that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to overdose.</v>

2125
01:29:57.060 --> 01:29:59.370
<v Speaker 1>Copper and selenium are very important </v>
<v Speaker 1>minerals,</v>

2126
01:29:59.371 --> 01:30:04.371
<v Speaker 1>but with minerals like balance is really</v>
<v Speaker 1>key because you've got to be real </v>

2127
01:30:04.371 --> 01:30:06.480
<v Speaker 1>careful with like overdosing and certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>minerals.</v>

2128
01:30:06.530 --> 01:30:10.490
<v Speaker 1>There was cross a brazilian nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll take this into account from dose to</v>

2129
01:30:10.491 --> 01:30:12.870
<v Speaker 1>dose daily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were selling these mega vitamins,</v>

2130
01:30:12.871 --> 01:30:13.260
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2131
01:30:13.340 --> 01:30:15.780
<v Speaker 1>these kind of talking about how they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were selling vitamin d tablets,</v>

2132
01:30:15.781 --> 01:30:19.510
<v Speaker 1>gel caps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was 3000 over 3000 milligrams and</v>

2133
01:30:19.710 --> 01:30:24.710
<v Speaker 1>the guy said to get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to eat 1500 almonds to get </v>

2134
01:30:24.710 --> 01:30:26.070
<v Speaker 1>that much vitamin e.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's too much.</v>

2135
01:30:26.071 --> 01:30:27.920
<v Speaker 1>It's just too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got a lot of vitamins,</v>

2136
01:30:28.020 --> 01:30:29.730
<v Speaker 1>you gotta you gotta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be careful.</v>

2137
01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:31.510
<v Speaker 1>You can't be an idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2138
01:30:31.620 --> 01:30:33.840
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty basic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's easy to be an idiot.</v>

2139
01:30:33.841 --> 01:30:35.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's easy to be an idiot,</v>

2140
01:30:35.520 --> 01:30:40.520
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what's really weird about this </v>

2141
01:30:40.520 --> 01:30:40.520
<v Speaker 1>supplement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The supplement business like uh,</v>

2142
01:30:40.520 --> 01:30:41.460
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very tricky.</v>

2143
01:30:41.460 --> 01:30:44.670
<v Speaker 1>Like what effects certain people doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>affect other people.</v>

2144
01:30:44.760 --> 01:30:48.360
<v Speaker 1>Like with alpha brain for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we first put alpha brain now we had</v>

2145
01:30:48.390 --> 01:30:53.190
<v Speaker 1>slightly different ingredients because </v>
<v Speaker 1>some people had an adverse reaction.</v>

2146
01:30:53.191 --> 01:30:54.930
<v Speaker 1>They would get like a headache when they</v>
<v Speaker 1>would take.</v>

2147
01:30:54.931 --> 01:30:56.840
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't a dangerous thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was enough for like,</v>

2148
01:30:56.870 --> 01:30:57.960
<v Speaker 1>hm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

2149
01:30:58.200 --> 01:31:00.120
<v Speaker 1>we got to back this down a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you,</v>

2150
01:31:00.121 --> 01:31:03.810
<v Speaker 1>you got to be careful with like certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>reactions that some people have.</v>

2151
01:31:04.020 --> 01:31:06.410
<v Speaker 1>You know like you with cats like you </v>
<v Speaker 1>with peanuts,</v>

2152
01:31:06.420 --> 01:31:08.790
<v Speaker 1>like that's the thing when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 1>vaccinations,</v>

2153
01:31:08.791 --> 01:31:13.791
<v Speaker 1>like everybody talks about vaccinations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're either in the camp of you </v>

2154
01:31:13.791 --> 01:31:18.050
<v Speaker 1>believe that vaccinations are evil and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they cause autism or you're in the camp </v>

2155
01:31:18.050 --> 01:31:22.701
<v Speaker 1>that those people are idiots and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous and then these anti vaccine </v>

2156
01:31:22.701 --> 01:31:26.151
<v Speaker 1>people are really making all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>diseases like measles show up in New </v>

2157
01:31:26.151 --> 01:31:29.600
<v Speaker 1>York city again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the reality is that the truth lies </v>

2158
01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:32.400
<v Speaker 1>somewhere in the middle because yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vaccines are super important.</v>

2159
01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:37.400
<v Speaker 1>They're the reason why we don't have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of infectious diseases that wrecked </v>

2160
01:31:37.400 --> 01:31:39.870
<v Speaker 1>havoc and there's science behind them </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's fascinating.</v>

2161
01:31:39.871 --> 01:31:44.871
<v Speaker 1>The human beings have figured out how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>create these things that have fight off </v>

2162
01:31:44.871 --> 01:31:48.081
<v Speaker 1>diseases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some people are going to have </v>

2163
01:31:48.081 --> 01:31:48.140
<v Speaker 1>adverse reactions to everYthing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

2164
01:31:48.450 --> 01:31:51.780
<v Speaker 1>That's the reality of medication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the reality of foods.</v>

2165
01:31:51.781 --> 01:31:55.820
<v Speaker 1>That's the reality to environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some people that can't small.</v>

2166
01:31:56.310 --> 01:31:58.380
<v Speaker 1>You're right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're right on with the masses,</v>

2167
01:31:58.410 --> 01:32:03.410
<v Speaker 1>but you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you're dealing with 300 million </v>

2168
01:32:03.410 --> 01:32:03.650
<v Speaker 1>people for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you're trying to get people,</v>

2169
01:32:03.700 --> 01:32:06.460
<v Speaker 1>but what I'm saying is when you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>those small amount of people,</v>

2170
01:32:06.490 --> 01:32:08.770
<v Speaker 1>if you have 300 million people and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>of them get vaccinated,</v>

2171
01:32:08.920 --> 01:32:11.180
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have 100 people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a thousand people.</v>

2172
01:32:11.181 --> 01:32:16.181
<v Speaker 1>You can have all These examples of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that went wrong and people look </v>

2173
01:32:16.181 --> 01:32:16.181
<v Speaker 1>at that and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well look,</v>

2174
01:32:16.210 --> 01:32:18.310
<v Speaker 1>there's so many people where things are </v>
<v Speaker 1>going wrong,</v>

2175
01:32:18.311 --> 01:32:23.311
<v Speaker 1>but what you're not thinking about is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the just sheer numbers of people that </v>

2176
01:32:23.311 --> 01:32:26.410
<v Speaker 1>kept from being diseased,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sheer numbers of people that we.</v>

2177
01:32:26.500 --> 01:32:29.140
<v Speaker 1>How we contain polio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We contain anything.</v>

2178
01:32:29.141 --> 01:32:32.310
<v Speaker 1>Smallpox probably killed $500,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million people throughout history,</v>

2179
01:32:32.610 --> 01:32:37.610
<v Speaker 1>unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we squashed it out through </v>

2180
01:32:37.610 --> 01:32:40.771
<v Speaker 1>vaccination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All put so many children in on iron </v>

2181
01:32:40.771 --> 01:32:42.700
<v Speaker 1>lungs and in wheelchairs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not only that,</v>

2182
01:32:42.701 --> 01:32:44.350
<v Speaker 1>they did it in our grandparents' </v>
<v Speaker 1>lifetime.</v>

2183
01:32:44.880 --> 01:32:48.100
<v Speaker 1>Know incredible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredible discoveries have been made by</v>

2184
01:32:48.101 --> 01:32:53.101
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't mean that some people </v>

2185
01:32:53.101 --> 01:32:53.101
<v Speaker 1>have adverse reactions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people are going to eat peanuts and</v>

2186
01:32:53.101 --> 01:32:53.980
<v Speaker 1>they shouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to die.</v>

2187
01:32:54.010 --> 01:32:55.870
<v Speaker 1>It's going to happen every year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every year,</v>

2188
01:32:55.900 --> 01:32:58.000
<v Speaker 1>more than a thousand people die from </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspirin.</v>

2189
01:32:58.290 --> 01:33:00.220
<v Speaker 1>They take aspirin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you take supplements,</v>

2190
01:33:00.221 --> 01:33:04.360
<v Speaker 1>make sure you look into the data because</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of this stuff is not regulated,</v>

2191
01:33:04.361 --> 01:33:06.970
<v Speaker 1>so if you're going to take massive doses</v>
<v Speaker 1>of whatever it might be,</v>

2192
01:33:07.210 --> 01:33:10.840
<v Speaker 1>make sure you take a look at the data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take a look at the double blind studies,</v>

2193
01:33:10.870 --> 01:33:13.250
<v Speaker 1>see if it bears out well.</v>

2194
01:33:13.270 --> 01:33:15.810
<v Speaker 1>not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also when you get,</v>

2195
01:33:15.880 --> 01:33:20.880
<v Speaker 1>when you get a supplement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like say if you're running a supplement </v>

2196
01:33:20.880 --> 01:33:21.220
<v Speaker 1>company and you're buying vitamin b 12,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2197
01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:26.280
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to fucking task the vitamin b </v>

2198
01:33:26.280 --> 01:33:26.280
<v Speaker 1>12.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get from the source,</v>

2199
01:33:26.280 --> 01:33:27.900
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vitamin d,</v>

2200
01:33:28.110 --> 01:33:31.030
<v Speaker 1>whatever you're you're getting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to test it.</v>

2201
01:33:31.300 --> 01:33:36.300
<v Speaker 1>You have to test it independently </v>
<v Speaker 1>because with alpha brain we've had to </v>

2202
01:33:36.300 --> 01:33:39.721
<v Speaker 1>make sure we had in the past we had </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems with manufacturers having like </v>

2203
01:33:40.390 --> 01:33:45.390
<v Speaker 1>bad mixtures like when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so calcium from bone meal has a great </v>

2204
01:33:45.390 --> 01:33:46.880
<v Speaker 1>deal of lead in it or some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something like that.</v>

2205
01:33:46.890 --> 01:33:51.890
<v Speaker 1>Think is What is crazy amounts of lead </v>
<v Speaker 1>in bone meal for whatever reason.</v>

2206
01:33:52.300 --> 01:33:53.560
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember if that's the exact </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

2207
01:33:53.561 --> 01:33:54.880
<v Speaker 1>but it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like a metal,</v>

2208
01:33:54.950 --> 01:33:56.890
<v Speaker 1>it was a case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lawsuit,</v>

2209
01:33:57.370 --> 01:34:02.370
<v Speaker 1>and the vitamin company has brought up </v>
<v Speaker 1>on charges because the source of where </v>

2210
01:34:02.370 --> 01:34:03.580
<v Speaker 1>they were getting their calcium was very</v>
<v Speaker 1>heavy in.</v>

2211
01:34:03.970 --> 01:34:06.160
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe it was lead metal.</v>

2212
01:34:06.260 --> 01:34:11.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you got to know where it's sourced </v>

2213
01:34:11.260 --> 01:34:11.590
<v Speaker 1>from and you've got to know what your </v>
<v Speaker 1>body's life.</v>

2214
01:34:11.620 --> 01:34:13.720
<v Speaker 1>It's so hard to tell what the fuck's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on your body.</v>

2215
01:34:13.721 --> 01:34:15.330
<v Speaker 1>I told you I was having that problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a.</v>

2216
01:34:15.331 --> 01:34:18.040
<v Speaker 1>I had arsenic in my blood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It turned out it was from sardines.</v>

2218
01:34:22.320 --> 01:34:27.320
<v Speaker 1>Every science I've had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I've talked to about podcasts and </v>

2219
01:34:27.320 --> 01:34:27.320
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>says they always come down to one thing.</v>

01:37:03.080 --> 01:37:06.860
<v Speaker 3>Third one down will not drink coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will skip that one.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 3>going through the page.</v>

2296
01:37:11.811 --> 01:37:12.630
<v Speaker 3>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2299
01:37:14.870 --> 01:37:16.230
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about the coffee one.</v>

2300
01:37:16.230 --> 01:37:16.580
<v Speaker 3>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2301
01:37:16.581 --> 01:37:17.720
<v Speaker 3>yo,</v>

2303
01:37:19.580 --> 01:37:21.290
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can get into this if you want,</v>

2304
01:37:21.410 --> 01:37:23.840
<v Speaker 3>but there's clinical studies that show </v>
<v Speaker 3>coffee,</v>

2305
01:37:23.870 --> 01:37:28.870
<v Speaker 3>helps out with workouts and I mean it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>not bad for you if you do it in </v>

2306
01:37:28.870 --> 01:37:28.870
<v Speaker 3>moderation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She goes,</v>

2307
01:37:28.910 --> 01:37:30.230
<v Speaker 3>well then I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

2308
01:37:30.410 --> 01:37:31.190
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you right now.</v>

2309
01:37:31.191 --> 01:37:32.950

<v Speaker 3>I'll walk ouT right now.</v>

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:34.670
<v Speaker 3>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

2311
01:37:34.671 --> 01:37:37.040
<v Speaker 3>I'll make one exception and then just </v>
<v Speaker 3>right then I was like,</v>

2312
01:37:37.041 --> 01:37:38.300
<v Speaker 3>god,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not going good.</v>

2313
01:37:39.130 --> 01:37:41.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't work with her anymore.</v>

2314
01:37:41.931 --> 01:37:43.400
<v Speaker 3>Long story short,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she got fired.</v>

2315
01:37:43.430 --> 01:37:44.990
<v Speaker 3>Chili cheese fries should have fired </v>
<v Speaker 3>her.</v>

2316
01:37:44.991 --> 01:37:49.991
<v Speaker 3>That shit's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should be eating fruit and </v>

2317
01:37:49.991 --> 01:37:49.991
<v Speaker 3>vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not chili fries.</v>

2318
01:37:49.991 --> 01:37:52.670
<v Speaker 3>Chili cheese fries with rice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she said the calories.</v>

2319
01:37:53.270 --> 01:37:54.500
<v Speaker 3>Oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's so retarded.</v>

2320
01:37:54.530 --> 01:37:56.010
<v Speaker 3>This is pre workout.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did she ever</v>

2321
01:37:56.010 --> 01:37:59.190
<v Speaker 1>worked out hard a day in her life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what kinda throw up and shit</v>

2322
01:37:59.191 --> 01:38:01.470
<v Speaker 1>would come out of your body if you eat </v>
<v Speaker 1>chili cheese,</v>

2323
01:38:01.471 --> 01:38:03.960
<v Speaker 1>fries and that did like a strength and </v>
<v Speaker 1>conditioning workout.</v>

2324
01:38:03.961 --> 01:38:06.870
<v Speaker 1>Did box jumps and kettle bells and </v>
<v Speaker 1>battle ropes.</v>

2325
01:38:07.140 --> 01:38:09.720
<v Speaker 1>Chili running through your bowels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ready for this?</v>

2326
01:38:09.730 --> 01:38:10.380
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2327
01:38:11.140 --> 01:38:14.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to launch at the bell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only heavy weighting.</v>

2328
01:38:14.040 --> 01:38:16.800
<v Speaker 1>Who's on a diet like this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called the alpha diet.</v>

2329
01:38:17.580 --> 01:38:22.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't eat breakfast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do bulletproof coffee and the mct oil </v>

2330
01:38:22.580 --> 01:38:22.880
<v Speaker 1>and I hit the ground running.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2331
01:38:22.940 --> 01:38:25.680
<v Speaker 1>that is about don't you juice in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>morning?</v>

2332
01:38:25.710 --> 01:38:26.520
<v Speaker 1>Vegetable juice?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2333
01:38:26.540 --> 01:38:31.540
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh well that's something too and you'd </v>

2334
01:38:31.540 --> 01:38:31.890
<v Speaker 1>be amazed at how much butter and mct oil</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing.</v>

2335
01:38:32.130 --> 01:38:37.130
<v Speaker 1>The reason why this bulletproof blend </v>
<v Speaker 1>works is because you have the healthy </v>

2336
01:38:37.130 --> 01:38:39.210
<v Speaker 1>fats connected to the caffeine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a slow burn of the caffeine,</v>

2337
01:38:39.540 --> 01:38:41.430
<v Speaker 1>but you can't get over the actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>calories.</v>

2338
01:38:41.430 --> 01:38:46.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean someone should take one of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>things and find out how much like a </v>

2339
01:38:46.430 --> 01:38:50.331
<v Speaker 1>thermos of this bitch is calorically </v>
<v Speaker 1>with that much butter and that much mct </v>

2340
01:38:50.331 --> 01:38:51.390
<v Speaker 1>oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet it's quite a bit.</v>

2341
01:38:51.410 --> 01:38:56.410
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eating a funk on hunk of butter takes a </v>

2342
01:38:56.410 --> 01:38:56.410
<v Speaker 1>while for your body to digest those </v>
<v Speaker 1>fats,</v>

2343
01:38:56.490 --> 01:38:58.070
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm it though.</v>

2344
01:38:58.130 --> 01:39:00.630
<v Speaker 1>You could burn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a great way to work out,</v>

2345
01:39:00.750 --> 01:39:03.540
<v Speaker 1>like to drink that stuff in the morning </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you feel full,</v>

2346
01:39:03.541 --> 01:39:07.050
<v Speaker 1>you have energy and yet you still get a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good workout and drinking.</v>

2347
01:39:07.120 --> 01:39:10.960
<v Speaker 1>What about eating a sugar source before </v>
<v Speaker 1>you work out?</v>

2348
01:39:11.250 --> 01:39:13.080
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what would it be good.</v>

2349
01:39:13.170 --> 01:39:15.620
<v Speaker 1>Like they say nothing's better than </v>
<v Speaker 1>fruits.</v>

2350
01:39:15.630 --> 01:39:17.280
<v Speaker 1>So not pancakes or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2351
01:39:17.290 --> 01:39:17.910
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2352
01:39:17.911 --> 01:39:18.330
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2353
01:39:18.331 --> 01:39:21.240
<v Speaker 1>That's terrible for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pick some chili cheese fries.</v>

2354
01:39:21.270 --> 01:39:24.900
<v Speaker 1>If you're doing endurance sports.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gluten is a tricky thing,</v>

2355
01:39:24.901 --> 01:39:29.901
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you have a bad reaction to </v>

2356
01:39:29.901 --> 01:39:29.901
<v Speaker 1>gluten,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2357
01:39:29.901 --> 01:39:30.870
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have all sorts of issues</v>

2358
01:39:30.871 --> 01:39:33.450
<v Speaker 1>and even if you don't have a bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>reaction to gluten,</v>

2359
01:39:33.720 --> 01:39:38.720
<v Speaker 1>the studies are showing pretty clearly </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it causes inflammation and it may </v>

2360
01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:40.290
<v Speaker 1>be fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with a lot of people,</v>

2361
01:39:40.291 --> 01:39:41.970
<v Speaker 1>you get this bloated appearance.</v>

2362
01:39:42.120 --> 01:39:45.470
<v Speaker 1>Like I've seen people go from wheat to </v>
<v Speaker 1>no wheat and then they're,</v>

2363
01:39:45.471 --> 01:39:48.090
<v Speaker 1>the face shrinks in their body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looks different.</v>

2364
01:39:48.150 --> 01:39:53.150
<v Speaker 1>It's like your body's inflamed and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of weird calories.</v>

2365
01:39:53.580 --> 01:39:56.010
<v Speaker 1>It's calories where your body's breaking</v>
<v Speaker 1>down glue,</v>

2366
01:39:56.270 --> 01:39:57.690
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean taste great.</v>

2367
01:39:57.810 --> 01:39:59.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love lasagna,</v>

2368
01:39:59.251 --> 01:40:01.830
<v Speaker 1>I love pasta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love delicious bread.</v>

2369
01:40:02.020 --> 01:40:02.820
<v Speaker 1>Don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's great.</v>

2370
01:40:02.821 --> 01:40:04.320
<v Speaker 1>You go to a restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>italian restaurant,</v>

2371
01:40:04.321 --> 01:40:06.070
<v Speaker 1>they bring over that pregnant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smell it and yes,</v>

2372
01:40:06.120 --> 01:40:09.480
<v Speaker 1>I'll put some butter on that and me and </v>
<v Speaker 1>brian like a nice cheese plate,</v>

2373
01:40:10.110 --> 01:40:11.520
<v Speaker 1>little cheese plates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these plates.</v>

2374
01:40:11.521 --> 01:40:12.480
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

2375
01:40:12.481 --> 01:40:15.240
<v Speaker 1>The problem is gluten is just not a </v>
<v Speaker 1>smart choice.</v>

2376
01:40:15.241 --> 01:40:17.310
<v Speaker 1>If you thinking about what you're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to put in your body,</v>

2377
01:40:17.850 --> 01:40:22.850
<v Speaker 1>why fuck around with that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could have lettuce and you can have </v>

2378
01:40:22.850 --> 01:40:23.700
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of delicious greens and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could have fresh meats.</v>

2379
01:40:24.120 --> 01:40:27.390
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have a good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your body's going to get good nutrients,</v>

2380
01:40:27.391 --> 01:40:32.391
<v Speaker 1>can have What it needs when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>having gluten or pasta or anything like </v>

2381
01:40:32.391 --> 01:40:35.451
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just giving it a nice delicious </v>

2382
01:40:35.451 --> 01:40:35.451
<v Speaker 1>taste,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if that's where you're cool with,</v>

2383
01:40:35.451 --> 01:40:36.420
<v Speaker 1>that's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know you're just out on a date,</v>

2384
01:40:36.421 --> 01:40:41.421
<v Speaker 1>one to have a delicious meal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you want performance food for </v>

2385
01:40:41.421 --> 01:40:44.151
<v Speaker 1>your body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really shouldn't fuck with anything </v>

2386

<v Speaker 1>that's complicated.</v>

<v Speaker 2>and he goes,</v>

2407
01:41:33.100 --> 01:41:33.550
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

2408
01:41:33.551 --> 01:41:35.410
<v Speaker 2>if I had the one meeting every day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be out.</v>

2409
01:41:35.560 --> 01:41:40.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people think that giant animal </v>

2410
01:41:40.560 --> 01:41:40.560
<v Speaker 2>never had elk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should be hunter.</v>

2411
01:41:40.870 --> 01:41:41.910
<v Speaker 2>You'd love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hate.</v>

2412
01:41:41.970 --> 01:41:46.970
<v Speaker 2>I hate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sent a picture of the deer and we </v>

2413
01:41:46.970 --> 01:41:46.970
<v Speaker 2>could use bone marrow.</v>

2414
01:41:46.970 --> 01:41:46.970
<v Speaker 2>I'd be telling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2415
01:41:46.970 --> 01:41:47.860
<v Speaker 2>we'd be down for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

2416
01:41:47.920 --> 01:41:49.360
<v Speaker 2>let's do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said the three of us,</v>

2417
01:41:49.370 --> 01:41:52.000
<v Speaker 2>deer hunting to hone ranch would be down</v>
<v Speaker 2>for that.</v>

2418
01:41:52.060 --> 01:41:53.920
<v Speaker 2>I bet you would be down for naked and </v>
<v Speaker 2>afraid.</v>

2419
01:41:53.970 --> 01:41:56.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doing his thing.</v>

2420
01:41:56.190 --> 01:41:56.560
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2421
01:41:56.561 --> 01:42:01.561
<v Speaker 2>We're gonna wear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna wear extra clothes just </v>

2422
01:42:01.561 --> 01:42:03.601
<v Speaker 2>because I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I would wreck shop on that show.</v>

2423
01:42:04.240 --> 01:42:07.330
<v Speaker 2>I think you do find until you got your </v>
<v Speaker 2>dick bit by a spider and then you cry.</v>

2424
01:42:07.460 --> 01:42:11.560
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I'm telling you to own ranch,</v>

2425
01:42:11.620 --> 01:42:14.350
<v Speaker 2>hour and a half north of here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We stay for a weekend.</v>

2426
01:42:14.351 --> 01:42:19.351
<v Speaker 2>We film it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We go pig hunting with bows and arrows </v>

2427
01:42:19.351 --> 01:42:19.351
<v Speaker 2>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so down for two days though,</v>

2428
01:42:19.351 --> 01:42:19.900
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two days.</v>

2429
01:42:20.470 --> 01:42:22.780
<v Speaker 2>Saturday and sunday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then we say,</v>

2430
01:42:24.060 --> 01:42:25.630
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then we spot on sunday.</v>

2431
01:42:25.650 --> 01:42:28.620
<v Speaker 2>I'll fill his spot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spot each other lifting spot,</v>

2432
01:42:28.660 --> 01:42:30.170
<v Speaker 2>spa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spa,</v>

2433
01:42:30.220 --> 01:42:31.630
<v Speaker 2>hot tub,</v>
<v Speaker 2>facials.</v>

2434
01:42:31.810 --> 01:42:32.890
<v Speaker 2>I got confused.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2435
01:42:33.130 --> 01:42:35.050
<v Speaker 2>he's a prima donna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll be like,</v>

2436
01:42:35.080 --> 01:42:40.080
<v Speaker 2>what if he.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he got the toughest one of the </v>

2437
01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:40.080
<v Speaker 2>toughest guys in the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he misses a meal.</v>

2438
01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:40.980
<v Speaker 2>If he's a half hour late to him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2439
01:42:40.990 --> 01:42:43.270
<v Speaker 2>he's like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm lightheaded man.</v>

2440
01:42:43.540 --> 01:42:48.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm starving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you gotta think of what he's doing </v>

2441
01:42:48.540 --> 01:42:48.540
<v Speaker 2>with his body all day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't even imagine.</v>

2442
01:42:48.540 --> 01:42:50.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm chilly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm cold.</v>

2443
01:42:50.410 --> 01:42:50.770
<v Speaker 2>You guys.</v>

2444
01:42:53.290 --> 01:42:56.140
<v Speaker 2>Imagine how fucking much he works out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you don't.</v>

2445
01:42:56.170 --> 01:42:57.720
<v Speaker 2>You don't take that into consideration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2446
01:42:57.730 --> 01:43:02.730
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brian who I work out all the time once a</v>

2447
01:43:02.740 --> 01:43:07.740
<v Speaker 2>week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he might get in a workout once a week </v>

2448
01:43:07.740 --> 01:43:08.830
<v Speaker 2>and he probably instagrams that to just </v>
<v Speaker 2>work out moderately.</v>

2449
01:43:08.890 --> 01:43:11.380
<v Speaker 2>You might work out once a week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might go a month.</v>

2450
01:43:11.470 --> 01:43:15.910
<v Speaker 2>He's the guy on was the longest day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many days have you gone?</v>

2451
01:43:15.911 --> 01:43:17.950
<v Speaker 2>The longest without anyone at work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every single day.</v>

2452
01:43:18.010 --> 01:43:20.890
<v Speaker 2>The fuck away from that question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll come to your house and find you not</v>

2453
01:43:20.891 --> 01:43:24.850

2454
01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.220
<v Speaker 2>Twice a week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I work out too.</v>

2455
01:43:27.230 --> 01:43:29.800
<v Speaker 2>I don't work out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't ever work out everyday.</v>

2456
01:43:29.801 --> 01:43:31.690
<v Speaker 2>Nobody works out every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need days off.</v>

2457
01:43:31.790 --> 01:43:34.790
<v Speaker 2>I take sunday off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Brian's footwork is impressive.</v>

01:43:42.250 --> 01:43:44.440
<v Speaker 2>It's impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I saw pres.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He's got an aldi.</v>

2464

<v Speaker 2>I am definitely not.</v>

2469
01:44:01.470 --> 01:44:06.470
<v Speaker 2>As you get more tired boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just try to just try to move around and </v>

2470
01:44:06.470 --> 01:44:08.150
<v Speaker 2>you're exhausted.</v>

<v Speaker 2>but whenever I'm around brendan,</v>

2476
01:44:21.560 --> 01:44:23.150
<v Speaker 2>a little extra blood flows in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2477
01:44:23.151 --> 01:44:28.151
<v Speaker 2>you know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's that same thing that causes men </v>

2478
01:44:28.151 --> 01:44:29.090
<v Speaker 2>chimps to have bigger balls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're around a an alpha male,</v>

2479
01:44:29.091 --> 01:44:30.290
<v Speaker 2>and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2483
01:44:35.241 --> 01:44:37.930
<v Speaker 2>That's not the way to compete for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It very.</v>

2484
01:44:37.970 --> 01:44:40.520
<v Speaker 2>Obviously you're mixing it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get confused.</v>

2485
01:44:40.521 --> 01:44:42.350
<v Speaker 2>They'll get these chimps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Paul's looking at that.</v>

2486
01:44:42.710 --> 01:44:43.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Jesus christ.</v>

2488
01:44:46.250 --> 01:44:47.310
<v Speaker 2>Good luck with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2489
01:44:47.410 --> 01:44:52.410
<v Speaker 2>it's cancer or brutality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but totally different tendonous </v>

2490
01:44:52.410 --> 01:44:52.410
<v Speaker 2>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything's bigger and thicker.</v>

2491
01:44:52.820 --> 01:44:54.210
<v Speaker 2>Everything's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

2492
01:44:54.290 --> 01:44:59.290
<v Speaker 2>that thing weighs 150 pounds and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>can throw itself through the air with </v>

2493
01:44:59.290 --> 01:45:02.891
<v Speaker 2>its arms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's imagine that they grab a branch </v>

2494
01:45:02.891 --> 01:45:03.890
<v Speaker 2>and just throw themselves through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>air.</v>

2495
01:45:03.891 --> 01:45:08.230
<v Speaker 2>It's that other one like it's velcro and</v>
<v Speaker 2>just hang and fucking.</v>

2496
01:45:08.630 --> 01:45:11.030
<v Speaker 2>They could be a thousand feet off the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ground hanging from a branch.</v>

2497
01:45:11.670 --> 01:45:12.830
<v Speaker 2>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>joe?</v>

2498
01:45:12.831 --> 01:45:15.530
<v Speaker 2>Do you think you could tear it up on </v>
<v Speaker 2>naked and afraid?</v>

2499

<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>

2501
01:45:19.400 --> 01:45:24.400
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the stupidity of it all would insult me </v>

2502
01:45:24.400 --> 01:45:28.031
<v Speaker 2>as a human being so dumb that I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>willing to be on a show that was </v>

2503
01:45:28.031 --> 01:45:28.820
<v Speaker 2>exploiting me to the point of making me </v>
<v Speaker 2>naked.</v>

2504
01:45:29.060 --> 01:45:30.980
<v Speaker 2>Go through the fucking jungle.</v>

2510
01:45:44.181 --> 01:45:45.530

<v Speaker 2>this is so stupid.</v>

2511
01:45:45.531 --> 01:45:48.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm sleeping on dirt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's spiders everywhere.</v>

2512
01:45:49.050 --> 01:45:51.140
<v Speaker 2>I just like the challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not outdoors.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Guy had hunting gear like joe and I did </v>
<v Speaker 2>with gear with tense.</v>

2514
01:45:56.360 --> 01:45:58.400
<v Speaker 2>That's a bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That sounds super boring.</v>

2515
01:45:58.700 --> 01:46:00.350
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't boring at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was very exciting.</v>

2516
01:46:01.170 --> 01:46:06.170
<v Speaker 2>Brian in Montana,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was scary.</v>

2517
01:46:07.040 --> 01:46:08.750
<v Speaker 2>That was fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was really fun.</v>

2518
01:46:08.780 --> 01:46:13.780
<v Speaker 2>We went rafting 40 miles down the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Missouri river place where there's </v>

2519
01:46:13.780 --> 01:46:15.920

2520
01:46:16.140 --> 01:46:18.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm down to kill animals with a bow gun </v>
<v Speaker 2>does nothing for me.</v>

2521
01:46:19.040 --> 01:46:24.040
<v Speaker 2>Just super boring guns is a great way to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do it because you definitely kill them </v>

2522
01:46:24.040 --> 01:46:27.050
<v Speaker 2>and you also can get them at a large </v>
<v Speaker 2>distance so you can get many more shots.</v>

2523
01:46:27.290 --> 01:46:29.740
<v Speaker 2>Like getting up on some animals is super</v>
<v Speaker 2>problematic.</v>

2524
01:46:29.750 --> 01:46:32.800
<v Speaker 2>Problematic with a bone arrow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what we did kind of hunting.</v>

2525
01:46:33.070 --> 01:46:33.860
<v Speaker 2>We did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2526
01:46:33.861 --> 01:46:36.320
<v Speaker 2>They started a lot too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They also,</v>

2527
01:46:36.470 --> 01:46:37.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they.</v>

2528
01:46:37.641 --> 01:46:40.970
<v Speaker 2>They had been doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>they did okay and did pretty well.</v>

2529
01:46:40.971 --> 01:46:45.971
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot more buffalo back then </v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't have the long range rifle </v>

2530
01:46:45.971 --> 01:46:46.610
<v Speaker 2>capabilities of wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they got in the water.</v>

2531
01:46:46.611 --> 01:46:47.470
<v Speaker 2>A lot of times they went to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2532
01:46:47.500 --> 01:46:49.450
<v Speaker 2>they crossed the river and then they we </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do that.</v>

2533
01:46:49.600 --> 01:46:49.980
<v Speaker 2>That could</v>

2534
01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:51.950
<v Speaker 1>be the three of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We wait until they get in the water.</v>

2535
01:46:51.960 --> 01:46:54.730
<v Speaker 1>We start just bam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bam,</v>

2536
01:46:55.130 --> 01:46:58.650
<v Speaker 1>bam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whenever I have a 90 pound draw,</v>

2537
01:46:58.890 --> 01:47:03.050
<v Speaker 1>it shoots a 475 green arrow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty heavy.</v>

2538
01:47:03.070 --> 01:47:07.260
<v Speaker 1>Three hundred and two feet per second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It blows through everything.</v>

2539
01:47:07.590 --> 01:47:10.580
<v Speaker 1>It'll blow through a buffalo and elk </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

2540
01:47:10.590 --> 01:47:11.640
<v Speaker 1>Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boom,</v>

2541
01:47:11.641 --> 01:47:13.230
<v Speaker 1>right through bone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything.</v>

2542
01:47:13.290 --> 01:47:14.130
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's gone right?</v>

2543
01:47:14.131 --> 01:47:16.110
<v Speaker 1>It goes through trees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shoot it.</v>

2544
01:47:16.111 --> 01:47:21.111
<v Speaker 1>If I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I missed the target and it hit like </v>

2545
01:47:21.111 --> 01:47:21.111
<v Speaker 1>it hit the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2546
01:47:21.111 --> 01:47:23.100
<v Speaker 1>I had the target set up on this a fence </v>
<v Speaker 1>post.</v>

2547
01:47:23.280 --> 01:47:28.280
<v Speaker 1>It blew right through the fence post,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a big hey by four of would blew </v>

2548
01:47:28.280 --> 01:47:29.640
<v Speaker 1>right through and out the other side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a two by four.</v>

2549
01:47:30.060 --> 01:47:32.550
<v Speaker 1>Think about what it would do to a body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2550
01:47:32.610 --> 01:47:34.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of those,</v>

2551
01:47:35.100 --> 01:47:40.100
<v Speaker 1>you might as well have a gun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're going to have to be close </v>

2552
01:47:40.100 --> 01:47:41.160
<v Speaker 1>enough to hit it and shooting anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>20 yards away,</v>

2553
01:47:41.220 --> 01:47:41.850
<v Speaker 1>it's tough.</v>

2554
01:47:42.090 --> 01:47:45.300
<v Speaker 1>Forty yards away is really tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the difference between when I shoot</v>

2555
01:47:45.301 --> 01:47:47.940
<v Speaker 1>a target that's 20 yards away and 40 </v>
<v Speaker 1>yards away,</v>

2556
01:47:48.090 --> 01:47:51.290
<v Speaker 1>like the amount of movement that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could do before you release the arrow,</v>

2557
01:47:51.300 --> 01:47:56.300
<v Speaker 1>a 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got a little bit of wiggle room and </v>

2558
01:47:56.300 --> 01:47:58.191
<v Speaker 1>then you can release it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you get to 40 and it's so minute </v>

2559
01:47:58.191 --> 01:48:01.761
<v Speaker 1>because you're looking at something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not magnified your site and </v>

2560
01:48:01.761 --> 01:48:05.331
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at target that's so small</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's so far away and you just </v>

2561
01:48:05.331 --> 01:48:06.690
<v Speaker 1>keeping that motherfucker right there </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then letting it go.</v>

2562
01:48:06.810 --> 01:48:09.830
<v Speaker 1>Don't you find that more exciting than </v>
<v Speaker 1>having this done?</v>

2563
01:48:09.870 --> 01:48:12.640
<v Speaker 1>That basically does it all itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a video games.</v>

2564
01:48:12.660 --> 01:48:17.660
<v Speaker 1>Definitely more exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Animal comes walking through your </v>

2565
01:48:17.660 --> 01:48:20.541
<v Speaker 1>fricking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the problem with that logic </v>

2566
01:48:20.541 --> 01:48:20.541
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's a problem with that logic.</v>

2567
01:48:20.541 --> 01:48:20.541
<v Speaker 1>That poor animal will definitely get </v>
<v Speaker 1>killed.</v>

2568
01:48:20.541 --> 01:48:21.150
<v Speaker 1>If you have a rifle with a scope.</v>

2569
01:48:21.420 --> 01:48:22.590
<v Speaker 1>If you have a rifle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a scope,</v>

2570
01:48:22.591 --> 01:48:24.450
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at that animal from 200 </v>
<v Speaker 1>yards away.</v>

2571
01:48:24.451 --> 01:48:25.830
<v Speaker 1>That's a dead animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>

2572
01:48:25.831 --> 01:48:27.270
<v Speaker 1>You're blowing a hole through that thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>clean.</v>

2573
01:48:27.420 --> 01:48:32.420
<v Speaker 1>If that deer is sitting there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all in you not fucking up or your </v>

2574
01:48:32.420 --> 01:48:33.440
<v Speaker 1>your gear being off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could I.</v>

2575
01:48:33.450 --> 01:48:35.580
<v Speaker 1>I fucked up in Wisconsin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dropped my rifle.</v>

2576
01:48:35.581 --> 01:48:39.600
<v Speaker 1>I fell on a hill and my rifle scope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then when they installed the scope,</v>

2577
01:48:40.170 --> 01:48:45.170
<v Speaker 1>changed the scope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we got to Wisconsin and the guY </v>

2578
01:48:45.170 --> 01:48:45.170
<v Speaker 1>when he put the scope on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't have it tight and when we fail,</v>

2579
01:48:45.170 --> 01:48:50.130
<v Speaker 1>it was like you could lose it where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can move it with your fingers and it </v>

2580
01:48:50.130 --> 01:48:50.430
<v Speaker 1>caused an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get wounded you.</v>

2581
01:48:50.450 --> 01:48:55.450
<v Speaker 1>You don't want that and you have a way </v>
<v Speaker 1>more of a chance of that with a bow and </v>

2582
01:48:55.450 --> 01:48:59.730
<v Speaker 1>arrow way hard to shoot an animal with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>rifle.</v>

2583
01:49:00.030 --> 01:49:03.370
<v Speaker 1>Shooting an animal with a bow and arrow </v>
<v Speaker 1>is really good.</v>

2584
01:49:03.520 --> 01:49:07.020
<v Speaker 1>All this technology now that's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I saw the video of you,</v>

2585
01:49:07.080 --> 01:49:10.260
<v Speaker 1>the three of you just chilling like this</v>
<v Speaker 1>one sleeping bag,</v>

2586
01:49:10.261 --> 01:49:15.261
<v Speaker 1>telling jokes and then this little like </v>
<v Speaker 1>reindeer came prancing around and </v>

2587
01:49:15.261 --> 01:49:15.870
<v Speaker 1>caribou.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They live in Alaska.</v>

2588
01:49:15.900 --> 01:49:18.690
<v Speaker 1>You had like a bazooka and it came a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bazooka.</v>

2589
01:49:18.780 --> 01:49:19.300
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't a.</v>

2590
01:49:19.360 --> 01:49:24.360
<v Speaker 1>It was a canon light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had a helicopter gunshIp greater than</v>

2591
01:49:24.570 --> 01:49:25.740
<v Speaker 1>me while you eat me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

2592
01:49:25.741 --> 01:49:30.741
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just getting something that's </v>

2593
01:49:30.741 --> 01:49:32.810
<v Speaker 1>tortured all its life and then shoved </v>
<v Speaker 1>into a fucking vice and they put a </v>

2594
01:49:32.810 --> 01:49:33.150
<v Speaker 1>piston.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not against it.</v>

2595
01:49:33.180 --> 01:49:36.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying it doesn't seem very </v>
<v Speaker 1>exciting.</v>

2596
01:49:36.090 --> 01:49:41.090
<v Speaker 1>It's very exciting when that animal </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes out of the woods and it's looking </v>

2597
01:49:41.090 --> 01:49:41.300
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you get an animal in your sites,</v>

2598
01:49:41.550 --> 01:49:43.530
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've been tracking it for three days,</v>

2599
01:49:43.531 --> 01:49:46.050
<v Speaker 1>four days and you haven't seen and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>a wild animal.</v>

2600
01:49:46.080 --> 01:49:48.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying if you were it with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

2601
01:49:48.220 --> 01:49:50.110
<v Speaker 1>with bows and arrows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology,</v>

2602
01:49:50.111 --> 01:49:51.100
<v Speaker 1>it'd be a lot cooler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2603
01:49:51.101 --> 01:49:53.080
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Montana where we were,</v>

2604
01:49:53.081 --> 01:49:54.610
<v Speaker 1>if you were bow hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're fucked.</v>

2605
01:49:54.670 --> 01:49:56.200
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to get it close enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shot.</v>

2606
01:49:56.230 --> 01:49:59.770
<v Speaker 1>The closest shot I got was 200 yards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those the only shot that I got,</v>

2607
01:49:59.771 --> 01:50:02.530
<v Speaker 1>I got one deer shot it at 200 yards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a long way.</v>

2608
01:50:02.920 --> 01:50:05.800
<v Speaker 1>The you can't even see that far with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bow and arrow site.</v>

2609
01:50:05.801 --> 01:50:10.801
<v Speaker 1>I mean the idea that you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>hold that dear and it's gonna look so </v>

2610
01:50:10.801 --> 01:50:14.890
<v Speaker 1>small when you're looking at it with not</v>
<v Speaker 1>even harder.</v>

2611
01:50:14.891 --> 01:50:15.490
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2612
01:50:15.491 --> 01:50:17.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anybody's ever done it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe a few people have done it,</v>

2613
01:50:17.921 --> 01:50:22.921
<v Speaker 1>but you have to be like expert archers </v>
<v Speaker 1>to shoot a deer at 210 to 20 yards.</v>

2614
01:50:23.560 --> 01:50:25.510
<v Speaker 1>But with a rifle that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's common.</v>

2615
01:50:25.630 --> 01:50:26.540
<v Speaker 1>Super common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2616
01:50:26.740 --> 01:50:27.970
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you line it up,</v>

2617
01:50:27.971 --> 01:50:30.520
<v Speaker 1>it's a magnifying rifle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see the deer really clearly.</v>

2618
01:50:30.521 --> 01:50:32.650
<v Speaker 1>You locked the cross on his heart and </v>
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>

2619
01:50:32.651 --> 01:50:37.651
<v Speaker 1>it's over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think hundred would be a lot more </v>

2620
01:50:37.651 --> 01:50:38.560
<v Speaker 1>cooler if if you were hunting like </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that could sneak up on you and</v>

2621
01:50:38.561 --> 01:50:40.920
<v Speaker 1>kill you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be a lot cooler.</v>

2622
01:50:41.100 --> 01:50:42.660
<v Speaker 1>The problem like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like dear.</v>

2623
01:50:42.670 --> 01:50:44.830
<v Speaker 1>Oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I missed it goes prance and away.</v>

2624
01:50:44.831 --> 01:50:46.030
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like who cares?</v>

2625
01:50:46.060 --> 01:50:48.400
<v Speaker 1>So it would be cooler if Your life was </v>
<v Speaker 1>in danger.</v>

2626
01:50:48.580 --> 01:50:51.190
<v Speaker 1>That deere hat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like salim was like waterways,</v>

2627
01:50:51.550 --> 01:50:53.770
<v Speaker 1>water buffalo when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you should have water buffalo.</v>

2628
01:50:53.830 --> 01:50:57.490
<v Speaker 1>A lot of timeS they disappear into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tall grass and you must go into that.</v>

2629
01:50:57.491 --> 01:50:59.350
<v Speaker 1>Tallgrass and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and finish them off.</v>

2630
01:50:59.380 --> 01:51:01.900
<v Speaker 1>Now the video of cameron hanes shooting </v>
<v Speaker 1>a water bugs.</v>

2631
01:51:02.770 --> 01:51:05.530
<v Speaker 1>He's waiting for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My friend cameron hanes,</v>

2632
01:51:05.531 --> 01:51:10.531
<v Speaker 1>who uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the guy who got me hooked up with </v>

2633
01:51:10.531 --> 01:51:13.231
<v Speaker 1>hoyt and he's the guy who got me the 90 </v>
<v Speaker 1>pound bow is the same boat that he </v>

2634
01:51:13.231 --> 01:51:13.231
<v Speaker 1>shoots.</v>

2635
01:51:13.231 --> 01:51:14.950
<v Speaker 1>So I shot it at my house and it's so </v>
<v Speaker 1>accurate.</v>

2636
01:51:14.951 --> 01:51:16.030
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gotta get one of these things.</v>

2637
01:51:16.031 --> 01:51:17.710
<v Speaker 1>It's incredibLe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so accurate.</v>

2638
01:51:17.740 --> 01:51:21.100
<v Speaker 1>It makes me more confident to shoot </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I know that if it hits something</v>

2639
01:51:21.101 --> 01:51:22.570
<v Speaker 1>it's because it's got sites that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

2640
01:51:22.571 --> 01:51:23.180
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

2641
01:51:23.210 --> 01:51:24.520
<v Speaker 1>and it's just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So look at this.</v>

2642
01:51:24.670 --> 01:51:29.670
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he snuck up on this 2000 pound water </v>

2643
01:51:29.670 --> 01:51:31.180
<v Speaker 1>buffalo in Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are dangerous.</v>

2644
01:51:31.210 --> 01:51:36.210
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll try running first of all runs </v>

2645
01:51:36.210 --> 01:51:36.210
<v Speaker 1>faster than you and it weighs 2000 </v>
<v Speaker 1>pounds.</v>

2646
01:51:36.210 --> 01:51:37.660
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it only sees movement.</v>

2647
01:51:37.661 --> 01:51:42.661
<v Speaker 1>So You see how he's not moving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason why he's not moving is </v>

2648
01:51:42.661 --> 01:51:42.661
<v Speaker 1>because it's stopped because it's sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>movement.</v>

2649
01:51:42.661 --> 01:51:45.490
<v Speaker 1>So then when it goes back to eating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he starts creeping in.</v>

2650
01:51:45.491 --> 01:51:48.880
<v Speaker 1>This whole process is taking him along </v>
<v Speaker 1>to this guy.</v>

2651
01:51:48.940 --> 01:51:52.660
<v Speaker 1>This guy I'm going hunting with shape </v>
<v Speaker 1>two.</v>

2652
01:51:52.690 --> 01:51:53.680
<v Speaker 1>he's in very good shape.</v>

2653
01:51:53.680 --> 01:51:58.680
<v Speaker 1>He does 20 eIght chin ups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the reasons why he does </v>

2654
01:51:58.680 --> 01:52:01.381
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you could pull back this monster bow </v>

2655
01:52:01.381 --> 01:52:01.381
<v Speaker 1>because that beau is most human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can pull it back.</v>

2656
01:52:01.381 --> 01:52:03.560
<v Speaker 1>Brian can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so I'll do 28.</v>

2657
01:52:04.380 --> 01:52:06.820
<v Speaker 1>So eight pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how did he get this?</v>

2658
01:52:07.300 --> 01:52:09.340
<v Speaker 1>So this is a friend of his.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Behind him is filming this.</v>

2659
01:52:09.550 --> 01:52:14.550
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously there's a guy who was holding </v>

2660
01:52:14.550 --> 01:52:14.550
<v Speaker 1>the camera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he's is a long,</v>

2661
01:52:14.550 --> 01:52:15.520
<v Speaker 1>slow process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to speed it up,</v>

2662
01:52:15.521 --> 01:52:16.130
<v Speaker 1>leave it alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>

2663
01:52:16.450 --> 01:52:21.450
<v Speaker 1>this was a long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slow process where he has to wait for </v>

2664
01:52:21.450 --> 01:52:23.530
<v Speaker 1>this animal to give him a broadside shot</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when the animal's facing him,</v>

2665
01:52:23.531 --> 01:52:26.140
<v Speaker 1>he can't move at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy doesn't hunt with rifles.</v>

2666
01:52:26.290 --> 01:52:31.290
<v Speaker 1>All you hunt with bows and arrows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked this 60 pound ball and it was </v>

2667
01:52:31.691 --> 01:52:36.691
<v Speaker 1>really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're such a bitch going to shoot this </v>

2668
01:52:36.691 --> 01:52:36.691
<v Speaker 1>thing at the day and it takes a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>time bro,</v>

2669
01:52:36.691 --> 01:52:39.190
<v Speaker 1>because if you fuck up the thing knows </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're there and it's running at you.</v>

2670
01:52:39.610 --> 01:52:43.690
<v Speaker 1>Essentially it can't jump behind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The chair goes,</v>

2671
01:52:43.810 --> 01:52:48.810
<v Speaker 1>here it goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now the thing is going to give him a </v>

2672
01:52:48.810 --> 01:52:48.810
<v Speaker 1>broadside shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's close enough.</v>

2673
01:52:48.810 --> 01:52:50.180
<v Speaker 1>He's down to about 30 yards with a shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With an animal like this,</v>

2674
01:52:50.181 --> 01:52:53.450
<v Speaker 1>you want to ensure that you shoot that </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing through the fucking heart standing</v>

2675
01:52:55.030 --> 01:53:00.030
<v Speaker 1>faced the wrong way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has to go sideways totally because </v>

2676
01:53:00.030 --> 01:53:00.680
<v Speaker 1>right now it's quartering away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're only going to hit the shoulder</v>

2677
01:53:00.740 --> 01:53:03.800
<v Speaker 1>and it might not hit a vital organ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you've got an angry buffalo with</v>

2678
01:53:03.801 --> 01:53:08.801
<v Speaker 1>a stick in his arm and then it's running</v>
<v Speaker 1>at you and it weighs 2000 pounds and it </v>

2679
01:53:08.801 --> 01:53:09.650
<v Speaker 1>runs 40 miles an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good luck.</v>

2680
01:53:10.250 --> 01:53:11.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hi mohan.</v>

2681
01:53:11.421 --> 01:53:12.470
<v Speaker 1>Those trees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But look,</v>

2682
01:53:12.471 --> 01:53:14.900
<v Speaker 1>this thing is waiting and so he doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>move man,</v>

2683
01:53:14.901 --> 01:53:16.640
<v Speaker 1>because it's looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at this dude.</v>

2684
01:53:16.820 --> 01:53:21.820
<v Speaker 1>So this is a long fucking stock man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is like a 20 minute stock or he's </v>

2685
01:53:21.820 --> 01:53:26.120
<v Speaker 1>standing there with his 90 pound fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>bones man and he's not moving left.</v>

2686
01:53:26.260 --> 01:53:29.690
<v Speaker 1>So noW it goes back to eating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's decided that he's not.</v>

2687
01:53:29.840 --> 01:53:32.660
<v Speaker 1>He's nothing to be ashamed or to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned with.</v>

2688
01:53:32.690 --> 01:53:34.190
<v Speaker 1>Ashamed of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I saved up.</v>

2689
01:53:34.380 --> 01:53:36.770
<v Speaker 1>So now look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now he sees it and he pulls it back.</v>

2690
01:53:44.590 --> 01:53:44.720
<v Speaker 4>Good.</v>

2691
01:53:51.660 --> 01:53:55.270
<v Speaker 1>I think runs off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got to fucking grow through.</v>

2692
01:53:55.271 --> 01:54:00.271
<v Speaker 1>It goes through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the side of its arm and right into </v>

2693
01:54:00.271 --> 01:54:00.271
<v Speaker 1>its heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's Why there's so much blood pouring</v>

2694
01:54:00.271 --> 01:54:01.690
<v Speaker 1>out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why he hit it there.</v>

2695
01:54:01.790 --> 01:54:03.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well those animals,</v>

2696
01:54:03.510 --> 01:54:08.510
<v Speaker 1>you have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to know the anatomy of each </v>

2697
01:54:08.510 --> 01:54:09.420
<v Speaker 1>individual animal because animals have </v>
<v Speaker 1>their vitals in different areas.</v>

2698
01:54:09.421 --> 01:54:10.470
<v Speaker 1>So it's got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got an arrow.</v>

2699
01:54:10.471 --> 01:54:12.140
<v Speaker 1>It's heart right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2700
01:54:12.270 --> 01:54:17.270
<v Speaker 1>So it's going to sit there for a couple </v>
<v Speaker 1>seconds then realize it's done that </v>

2701
01:54:17.270 --> 01:54:17.520
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unlike that.</v>

2702
01:54:18.240 --> 01:54:23.240
<v Speaker 1>There it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to figure it out any second </v>

2703
01:54:23.240 --> 01:54:26.391
<v Speaker 1>now it just drops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean when you're dealing with an </v>

2704
01:54:26.391 --> 01:54:31.161
<v Speaker 1>animal that's that big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any other animal like a north american </v>

2705
01:54:31.161 --> 01:54:31.920
<v Speaker 1>animal would be dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A bear would be dead.</v>

2706
01:54:31.921 --> 01:54:33.720
<v Speaker 1>A deer would be dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything that's.</v>

2707
01:54:33.960 --> 01:54:37.170
<v Speaker 1>But this is just an enormous gigantic </v>
<v Speaker 1>animal.</v>

2708
01:54:37.860 --> 01:54:39.450
<v Speaker 1>Kidding me right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>

2709
01:54:40.050 --> 01:54:41.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it sort of takes awhile.</v>

2710
01:54:41.760 --> 01:54:44.910
<v Speaker 1>It's just sort of bleed out and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanders off and collapses.</v>

2711
01:54:46.170 --> 01:54:51.170
<v Speaker 1>He said he ate it and wayne,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he put one piece in his mouth and he </v>

2712
01:54:51.170 --> 01:54:53.010
<v Speaker 1>chewed it for half an hour before he </v>
<v Speaker 1>could swallow it.</v>

2713
01:54:53.040 --> 01:54:54.570
<v Speaker 1>That's some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's some dense muscle.</v>

2714
01:54:54.720 --> 01:54:55.890
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they were there,</v>

2715
01:54:55.891 --> 01:55:00.891
<v Speaker 1>they didn't bring any food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>they brought just enough snacks to get </v>

2716
01:55:00.891 --> 01:55:01.170
<v Speaker 1>them through like a day and they didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>bring any water,</v>

2717
01:55:01.230 --> 01:55:06.230
<v Speaker 1>so they had a boil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All This water and the water all had </v>

2718
01:55:06.230 --> 01:55:07.620
<v Speaker 1>buffalo piss in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So every drank,</v>

2719
01:55:07.680 --> 01:55:10.020
<v Speaker 1>every sip of water they drank was </v>
<v Speaker 1>buffalo pissed.</v>

2720
01:55:10.110 --> 01:55:11.940
<v Speaker 1>There's the thing fell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's done.</v>

2721
01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:13.610
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now this was in um,</v>

2722
01:55:14.220 --> 01:55:15.240
<v Speaker 1>in Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2723
01:55:15.330 --> 01:55:20.330
<v Speaker 1>Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know water buffaloes were in </v>

2724
01:55:20.330 --> 01:55:20.330
<v Speaker 1>Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2725
01:55:20.330 --> 01:55:20.330
<v Speaker 1>they're not native.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2726
01:55:20.330 --> 01:55:20.330
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what happened.</v>

2727
01:55:20.330 --> 01:55:24.870
<v Speaker 1>One of the reasons why they encourage </v>
<v Speaker 1>people to go over there and shoot them </v>

2728
01:55:24.870 --> 01:55:24.870
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A non native invasive species,</v>

2729
01:55:24.870 --> 01:55:29.781
<v Speaker 1>theY brought him over there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't have any natural </v>

2730
01:55:29.781 --> 01:55:29.781
<v Speaker 1>predators.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some things that can eat them,</v>

2731
01:55:29.781 --> 01:55:34.210
<v Speaker 1>like when they're babies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a crocodile I the size of that </v>

2732

<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2734

<v Speaker 2>companies like under armor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a famous bonner,</v>

2745
01:55:55.680 --> 01:55:59.700
<v Speaker 2>but this guy like he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he does ultra marathons.</v>

2746
01:55:59.701 --> 01:56:02.430
<v Speaker 2>He ran a 100 mile marathon beast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's an animal.</v>

2747
01:56:02.431 --> 01:56:07.431
<v Speaker 2>He's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what he does and he just does it </v>

2748
01:56:07.431 --> 01:56:07.431
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bow and arrow style.</v>

2749
01:56:07.431 --> 01:56:08.300
<v Speaker 2>That's my.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the shop.</v>

2750
01:56:08.560 --> 01:56:13.560
<v Speaker 2>After you retire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to need an outlet for all </v>

2751
01:56:13.560 --> 01:56:13.560
<v Speaker 2>this savage aggression you got inside </v>
<v Speaker 2>your body.</v>

2752
01:56:13.560 --> 01:56:13.920
<v Speaker 2>So I'll tell you what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not doing what?</v>

2753
01:56:13.980 --> 01:56:16.020
<v Speaker 2>Waiting six hours and shooting a water </v>
<v Speaker 2>buffalo.</v>

2754
01:56:17.590 --> 01:56:20.700
<v Speaker 2>Say you're not man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not iron man.</v>

2755
01:56:23.170 --> 01:56:27.000
<v Speaker 2>You like to hang out with you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll drink beers and stuff.</v>

2756
01:56:27.370 --> 01:56:30.540
<v Speaker 2>You'll do a lot of jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like when you retire.</v>

2757
01:56:30.970 --> 01:56:32.070
<v Speaker 2>Retire for fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2758
01:56:32.360 --> 01:56:37.360
<v Speaker 2>Do you have any?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do the world's actually in </v>

2759
01:56:37.360 --> 01:56:37.360
<v Speaker 2>may.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you really an ag?</v>

2760
01:56:37.360 --> 01:56:37.860
<v Speaker 2>Not geeky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

2761
01:56:38.100 --> 01:56:40.010
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You training with the gate?</v>

2762
01:56:40.011 --> 01:56:45.011
<v Speaker 2>Do you feel like that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you feel like it helps you in any </v>

2763
01:56:45.011 --> 01:56:45.011
<v Speaker 2>way?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would I do?</v>

2764
01:56:45.011 --> 01:56:48.351
<v Speaker 2>because if I have a 250 pound black </v>
<v Speaker 2>built on top of me and I can escape his </v>

2765
01:56:49.021 --> 01:56:53.580
<v Speaker 2>site controller or I can control them </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you take off the tee and these guys</v>

2766
01:56:53.581 --> 01:56:54.690
<v Speaker 2>are trying to punch me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>

2767
01:56:54.810 --> 01:56:57.090
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's easy for me really.</v>

2768
01:56:57.091 --> 01:56:58.350
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2769
01:56:58.351 --> 01:56:59.240
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's uh,</v>

2770
01:56:59.340 --> 01:57:03.210
<v Speaker 2>easier to defend because when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>defending with the ge you're more,</v>

2771
01:57:03.360 --> 01:57:05.870
<v Speaker 2>you hAve to be more technical with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>gif.</v>

2772
01:57:05.900 --> 01:57:07.200
<v Speaker 2>So much to worry about.</v>

2773
01:57:07.230 --> 01:57:12.230
<v Speaker 2>I have to worry about color chokes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy can grab me and control me </v>

2774
01:57:12.230 --> 01:57:12.780
<v Speaker 2>through my age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I'm saying?</v>

2775
01:57:12.781 --> 01:57:14.810
<v Speaker 2>So you feel like it's cross training?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2776
01:57:14.820 --> 01:57:19.820
<v Speaker 2>It takes away my explosiveness and my </v>
<v Speaker 2>athleticism and it forces me to use </v>

2777
01:57:19.820 --> 01:57:21.990
<v Speaker 2>technique.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I found that with defense for sure.</v>

2778
01:57:21.991 --> 01:57:26.991
<v Speaker 2>I get caught in a lot of arm bars with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the key that I would have never got </v>

2779
01:57:26.991 --> 01:57:29.721
<v Speaker 2>crushed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But also my in my defense goes through </v>

2780
01:57:29.721 --> 01:57:29.721
<v Speaker 2>the roof.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

2781
01:57:29.721 --> 01:57:33.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you play a different game when you </v>

2782
01:57:33.860 --> 01:57:35.631
<v Speaker 2>start doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just become much more technical and </v>

2783
01:57:35.631 --> 01:57:35.631
<v Speaker 2>much more aware of where the positions </v>
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>

2784
01:57:35.631 --> 01:57:36.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How flexible are you,</v>

2785
01:57:36.241 --> 01:57:37.620
<v Speaker 2>man?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2786
01:57:37.650 --> 01:57:40.080
<v Speaker 2>in cerTain areas like my hamstrings are </v>
<v Speaker 2>really tight,</v>

2787
01:57:40.420 --> 01:57:42.220
<v Speaker 2>but pretty flexible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2788
01:57:42.780 --> 01:57:43.830
<v Speaker 2>Do you have a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2789
01:57:43.831 --> 01:57:45.660
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't ask you this because someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>

2790
01:57:45.661 --> 01:57:47.790
<v Speaker 2>You might try to exploit it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you work your guard?</v>

2791
01:57:48.300 --> 01:57:49.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some guys are like,</v>

2792
01:57:49.860 --> 01:57:51.450
<v Speaker 2>fuck it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ain't going to be on my back.</v>

2793
01:57:51.480 --> 01:57:52.500
<v Speaker 2>That's stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2794
01:57:53.360 --> 01:57:54.000
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

2795
01:57:54.010 --> 01:57:56.910
<v Speaker 2>when I get taken down a little bit and </v>
<v Speaker 2>taken down twice in the octagon.</v>

2796
01:57:56.911 --> 01:57:59.070
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do not care.</v>

2797
01:57:59.220 --> 01:58:04.220
<v Speaker 2>Like if hunt was the whole game plan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he trained all this wrestling still </v>

2798
01:58:04.220 --> 01:58:08.841
<v Speaker 2>have a tough time taking me down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you trained all this wrestling </v>

2799
01:58:08.841 --> 01:58:08.841
<v Speaker 2>and decided to put me on my back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cool,</v>

2800
01:58:08.841 --> 01:58:10.380
<v Speaker 2>let's do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm all game for that.</v>

2801
01:58:10.470 --> 01:58:12.570
<v Speaker 2>I don't panic down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very comfortable down there.</v>

2802
01:58:12.720 --> 01:58:16.350
<v Speaker 2>I spent because you gotta remember my </v>
<v Speaker 2>daycare was shane carlin on top of me.</v>

2803
01:58:16.480 --> 01:58:18.090
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't getting a lot of take downs.</v>

2804
01:58:18.091 --> 01:58:23.091
<v Speaker 2>I was on my back all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a crazy way to start your </v>

2805
01:58:23.091 --> 01:58:23.340
<v Speaker 2>training in mma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was horrible.</v>

2806
01:58:23.910 --> 01:58:28.910
<v Speaker 2>Horrible mess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So credit is it like everyday just beat </v>

2807
01:58:28.910 --> 01:58:29.100
<v Speaker 2>me up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trevor whitman seems like a crazy dude,</v>

2808
01:58:29.101 --> 01:58:30.120
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's A good dude.</v>

2809
01:58:30.130 --> 01:58:31.860
<v Speaker 2>I mean like a very good dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good guy.</v>

2810
01:58:31.861 --> 01:58:36.861
<v Speaker 2>I haven't been there in years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A maniac like he had shane car when I'm </v>

2811
01:58:36.861 --> 01:58:41.380
<v Speaker 2>like why they wanted to have shankar </v>
<v Speaker 2>wind sport spar with gsp and gsp was </v>

2812
01:58:41.380 --> 01:58:41.380
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

2813
01:58:41.380 --> 01:58:42.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why</v>

2814
01:58:42.100 --> 01:58:42.900
<v Speaker 3>would I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>

2815
01:58:43.360 --> 01:58:45.610
<v Speaker 3>Why would I spar him?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what are you talking about?</v>

2816
01:58:45.611 --> 01:58:49.180
<v Speaker 3>You and I think like trevor's a genius </v>
<v Speaker 3>when comes straight and stuff like that.</v>

2817
01:58:49.181 --> 01:58:54.181
<v Speaker 3>But I think back on it and there's this </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing where I felt like I had to prove </v>

2818
01:58:54.181 --> 01:58:58.690
<v Speaker 3>day everyone I could hang with shane </v>
<v Speaker 3>carlin and no matter when we were </v>

2819
01:58:58.690 --> 01:59:01.950
<v Speaker 3>sparring,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's how my footwork got so good </v>

2820
01:59:01.950 --> 01:59:03.631
<v Speaker 3>because I'm used to this giant water </v>
<v Speaker 3>buffalo mad water buffalo chasing me </v>

2821
01:59:03.631 --> 01:59:08.281
<v Speaker 3>around the octagon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was trying to get out of the way </v>

2822
01:59:08.281 --> 01:59:08.680
<v Speaker 3>because he landed right hand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a short and he was not good man.</v>

2823
01:59:08.730 --> 01:59:09.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's trouble.</v>

2824
01:59:09.360 --> 01:59:10.630
<v Speaker 3>He hits so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got.</v>

2825
01:59:10.670 --> 01:59:13.360
<v Speaker 3>So I got used to that right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm moving nonstop.</v>

2826
01:59:13.540 --> 01:59:16.780
<v Speaker 3>And then when the bell go dinging with </v>
<v Speaker 3>30 seconds left,</v>

2827
01:59:17.110 --> 01:59:22.110
<v Speaker 3>literally no matter what we're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>me and shane would stop walk to the </v>

2828
01:59:22.110 --> 01:59:24.880
<v Speaker 3>middle of the cage and just rock 'em </v>
<v Speaker 3>sock 'em robots.</v>

2829
01:59:25.710 --> 01:59:30.430
<v Speaker 3>I did that for three years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then finally a part of me was like a</v>

2830
01:59:30.580 --> 01:59:35.580
<v Speaker 3>how about no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I shot a double bag on them and </v>

2831
01:59:35.580 --> 01:59:35.580
<v Speaker 3>we've never done that again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2832
01:59:35.580 --> 01:59:37.270
<v Speaker 3>But I think back on my training,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2833
01:59:37.271 --> 01:59:38.200
<v Speaker 3>god,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was stupid.</v>

2834
01:59:38.650 --> 01:59:39.820
<v Speaker 3>Even taking them down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2835
01:59:39.821 --> 01:59:41.980
<v Speaker 3>he's so strong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a big guY.</v>

2836
01:59:41.981 --> 01:59:44.560
<v Speaker 3>This guy ever is a big fucking guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2837
01:59:44.620 --> 01:59:49.620
<v Speaker 3>Strong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot stronger than you and your strong </v>

2838
01:59:49.620 --> 01:59:49.620
<v Speaker 3>shane is 100 percent stronger than me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>NoT even close.</v>

2839
01:59:49.620 --> 01:59:52.930
<v Speaker 3>he's ridiculously strong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>bone structure is just.</v>

2840
01:59:53.020 --> 01:59:54.960
<v Speaker 3>He's bigger than me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's bigger than lesnar.</v>

2841
01:59:55.260 --> 01:59:56.920
<v Speaker 3>Legs are thick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thick ass.</v>

2842
01:59:57.040 --> 01:59:59.050
<v Speaker 3>Huge shoulders.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His hands,</v>

2843
01:59:59.051 --> 02:00:00.950
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>before they did the,</v>

2844
02:00:01.030 --> 02:00:03.370
<v Speaker 3>they redid the ufc glove to fit over his</v>
<v Speaker 3>hands.</v>

2845
02:00:03.371 --> 02:00:04.450
<v Speaker 3>Shane's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shane's.</v>

2846
02:00:04.451 --> 02:00:07.480
<v Speaker 3>The reason why they changed the glove.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shane had a five xl gloves.</v>

2847
02:00:07.490 --> 02:00:10.990
<v Speaker 3>You have to cut the glove just to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>over to his hands are so ridiculous when</v>

2848
02:00:10.991 --> 02:00:11.470
<v Speaker 3>you shake them.</v>

2849
02:00:11.470 --> 02:00:14.170
<v Speaker 3>It's like holding onto a hand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what was frustrating to me is,</v>

2850
02:00:14.220 --> 02:00:16.040
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've always been in love with jujitsu.</v>

2851
02:00:16.050 --> 02:00:18.700
<v Speaker 3>I would spend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shane would get injured or you'd have to</v>

2852
02:00:18.701 --> 02:00:23.701
<v Speaker 3>work at a regular job and I was just </v>
<v Speaker 3>trained full time and I would think I </v>

2853
02:00:23.701 --> 02:00:26.641
<v Speaker 3>was being so good at jujitsu and shane </v>
<v Speaker 3>would come in off a nine to five shift </v>

2854
02:00:26.641 --> 02:00:28.050
<v Speaker 3>walk in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But jujitsu hunt,</v>

2855
02:00:28.080 --> 02:00:28.870
<v Speaker 3>let's do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2856
02:00:28.871 --> 02:00:31.870
<v Speaker 3>I'm going roll this big dude.</v>

2974
02:05:20.581 --> 02:05:22.410
<v Speaker 2>We'd do four classes back to back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>

2975
02:05:23.070 --> 02:05:24.930

<v Speaker 2>whatever man we can do.</v>

2984
02:05:44.640 --> 02:05:49.640
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could record it and both released </v>

2985
02:05:49.640 --> 02:05:49.640

<v Speaker 2>We do whatever we want and we don't,</v>

2987
02:05:50.220 --> 02:05:52.090
<v Speaker 2>but that would be really fun to break </v>
<v Speaker 2>down fights.</v>

2988
02:05:52.210 --> 02:05:54.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucking pumped about tim kennedy and</v>
<v Speaker 2>michael bisping.</v>

2989
02:05:55.260 --> 02:06:00.260
<v Speaker 2>This other thing with this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other thing with carla and what's </v>

2990
02:06:00.260 --> 02:06:01.530
<v Speaker 2>weird is there's the days of carwyn </v>
<v Speaker 2>lesnar who you just have these dudes who</v>

2991
02:06:01.531 --> 02:06:04.430
<v Speaker 2>are grill us cutting from 300 pounds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>

2992
02:06:04.450 --> 02:06:07.590
<v Speaker 2>Sixty five [inaudible] not that way </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore at the big boys are gone now.</v>

2993
02:06:07.591 --> 02:06:10.920
<v Speaker 2>You guys got like cain to 40 junior dos </v>
<v Speaker 2>santos to 40,</v>

2994
02:06:11.420 --> 02:06:14.940
<v Speaker 2>big brown to 40.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's kind of the more athletic.</v>

2995
02:06:15.300 --> 02:06:17.880
<v Speaker 2>I agree and I think that there's a point</v>
<v Speaker 2>of diminishing return,</v>

2996
02:06:17.881 --> 02:06:18.810
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you get too big,</v>

2997
02:06:18.811 --> 02:06:21.970
<v Speaker 2>your body just can't keep it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like When you saw kane.</v>

2998
02:06:22.060 --> 02:06:25.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm just running all over brock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the pace that he put on brock.</v>

2999
02:06:25.830 --> 02:06:30.830
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're dealing with a brock that was </v>

3000
02:06:30.830 --> 02:06:32.151
<v Speaker 2>sick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's hard to look at that like you </v>

3001
02:06:32.151 --> 02:06:33.030
<v Speaker 2>when now that we know that the dude had </v>
<v Speaker 2>that serious diverticulitis issue,</v>

3002
02:06:33.210 --> 02:06:35.190
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't mean you turn away from </v>
<v Speaker 2>punches.</v>

3003
02:06:35.340 --> 02:06:37.170
<v Speaker 2>Go carry on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's very good point.</v>

3004
02:06:37.320 --> 02:06:42.320
<v Speaker 2>There's also the issue of trying to deal</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a guy who's been striking for a </v>

3005
02:06:42.320 --> 02:06:43.630
<v Speaker 2>long fucking time and you are </v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially anonymously,</v>

3006
02:06:43.720 --> 02:06:44.500
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You knoW,</v>

3007
02:06:44.510 --> 02:06:46.500
<v Speaker 2>and you can't take the guy down if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>do take.</v>

3008
02:06:46.501 --> 02:06:47.710
<v Speaker 2>the guy did take it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>took,</v>

3009
02:06:47.730 --> 02:06:48.480
<v Speaker 2>came down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it came,</v>

3010
02:06:48.481 --> 02:06:51.780
<v Speaker 2>pops right back up to his feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you have to deal with that pace.</v>

3011
02:06:51.810 --> 02:06:53.430
<v Speaker 2>Well that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also mentally for him,</v>

3012
02:06:53.431 --> 02:06:55.110
<v Speaker 2>he gets guys down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're screwed.</v>

3013
02:06:55.111 --> 02:06:56.220
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Came down,</v>

3014
02:06:56.221 --> 02:06:58.500
<v Speaker 2>can got double risk and popped up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3015
02:06:58.501 --> 02:07:00.150
<v Speaker 2>And you and lazlo was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>damn.</v>

3016
02:07:00.280 --> 02:07:02.100
<v Speaker 2>You can see in his face like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>holy shit.</v>

3017
02:07:02.250 --> 02:07:03.690
<v Speaker 2>That's why when he fought shane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

3018
02:07:03.691 --> 02:07:06.390
<v Speaker 2>this fights over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This fight's over.</v>

3019

<v Speaker 2>shane just kind of get.</v>

3020
02:07:09.510 --> 02:07:11.400

<v Speaker 2>gases out.</v>

3021
02:07:11.401 --> 02:07:13.800
<v Speaker 2>Basically his body shut down on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gets choked out.</v>

3022

<v Speaker 2>I fought on the same night,</v>

<v Speaker 2>If he pays himself and picked his shot's</v>

3062
02:08:51.071 --> 02:08:52.600
<v Speaker 2>better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would he though?</v>

3063
02:08:52.601 --> 02:08:53.830
<v Speaker 2>They should've stopped the fight.</v>

3064
02:08:53.860 --> 02:08:58.860
<v Speaker 2>He's been to break up the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen fights stop for a lot less </v>

3065
02:08:59.620 --> 02:09:01.420
<v Speaker 2>cable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you were out that to be stopped,</v>

3066
02:09:01.421 --> 02:09:03.520
<v Speaker 2>that was you and you were okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like brock was.</v>

3067
02:09:03.630 --> 02:09:05.710
<v Speaker 2>Brock got back to his corner and he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>all right.</v>

3068
02:09:05.830 --> 02:09:07.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean he got hit with some big shots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree,</v>

3069
02:09:07.870 --> 02:09:08.930
<v Speaker 2>but he defended.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

3070
02:09:09.010 --> 02:09:10.990
<v Speaker 2>That's when I got a lot of respect for </v>
<v Speaker 2>brock.</v>

3071
02:09:11.050 --> 02:09:11.830
<v Speaker 2>After that fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

3072
02:09:11.850 --> 02:09:12.600
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's legit.</v>

3073
02:09:12.850 --> 02:09:13.990
<v Speaker 2>He's legit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I was like,</v>

3074
02:09:13.991 --> 02:09:15.730
<v Speaker 2>now sign me up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got rocked.</v>

3075
02:09:15.731 --> 02:09:17.950
<v Speaker 2>He got cut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had plenty of time to give up.</v>

3076
02:09:17.951 --> 02:09:19.900
<v Speaker 2>Plenty of time to give up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's when you were like,</v>

3077
02:09:19.940 --> 02:09:22.480
<v Speaker 2>I legit just didn't know how to deal </v>
<v Speaker 2>with canes hands.</v>

3078
02:09:22.510 --> 02:09:25.000
<v Speaker 2>Well came was just too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also he was.</v>

3079
02:09:25.690 --> 02:09:27.190
<v Speaker 2>He.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's operating in history.</v>

3080
02:09:27.310 --> 02:09:30.640
<v Speaker 2>His estimation at 40 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean in the real world?</v>

3081
02:09:30.640 --> 02:09:33.130
<v Speaker 2>Only he knows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>buT he definitely had diverticulitis.</v>

3082
02:09:33.131 --> 02:09:36.060
<v Speaker 2>Then even if you have 100 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you.</v>

3083
02:09:36.670 --> 02:09:38.950
<v Speaker 2>An a plus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A plus brock.</v>

02:09:39.310 --> 02:09:44.310
<v Speaker 2>Horrible matchup for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think it would be a great fight </v>

3085
02:09:44.310 --> 02:09:44.310
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fun fight while it lasted,</v>

3086
02:09:44.310 --> 02:09:45.280
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think they really don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>think so.</v>

3087
02:09:45.550 --> 02:09:47.030
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why because.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because.</v>

3088
02:09:47.250 --> 02:09:49.900
<v Speaker 2>Because candy canes a lot smarter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has more tools.</v>

3089
02:09:50.030 --> 02:09:53.800
<v Speaker 2>His gas tank so much better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think after awhile it take its toll on</v>

3090
02:09:53.801 --> 02:09:55.570
<v Speaker 2>brock and he tko them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Time after time.</v>

3091
02:09:55.870 --> 02:09:57.880
<v Speaker 2>Junior dos santos will never be the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

3092
02:09:57.970 --> 02:09:59.170
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3093
02:09:59.200 --> 02:10:03.280
<v Speaker 2>never ever be the same again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those two fights were fucking insane.</v>

3094
02:10:03.310 --> 02:10:04.840
<v Speaker 2>The corners should have threw in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>towel.</v>

3095
02:10:05.410 --> 02:10:06.100
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3096
02:10:06.160 --> 02:10:07.960
<v Speaker 2>you know when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it ended too.</v>

3097
02:10:07.961 --> 02:10:10.660
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy because it ended from him </v>
<v Speaker 2>falling on his head.</v>

3098
02:10:11.140 --> 02:10:11.920
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3099
02:10:12.040 --> 02:10:14.260
<v Speaker 2>he got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got a,</v>

3100
02:10:14.290 --> 02:10:17.080
<v Speaker 2>he tried to do like a power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good teen on,</v>

3101
02:10:17.140 --> 02:10:22.140
<v Speaker 2>on cain and cain ducked under and junior</v>
<v Speaker 2>was so tired and he'd taken such a </v>

3102
02:10:22.140 --> 02:10:26.581
<v Speaker 2>beating that he's holding onto this team</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he literally falls forward right </v>

3103
02:10:26.581 --> 02:10:27.950
<v Speaker 2>onto his head and like stuns himself.</v>

3104
02:10:27.960 --> 02:10:32.960
<v Speaker 2>Then they Stopped the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the beating that he took up until </v>

3105
02:10:32.960 --> 02:10:35.971
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was three st pete times were herb </v>

3106
02:10:35.971 --> 02:10:38.771
<v Speaker 2>dean was like moving close to stop the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight and then juniors heart pulled </v>

3107
02:10:38.771 --> 02:10:40.070
<v Speaker 2>through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was insane.</v>

3108
02:10:40.100 --> 02:10:42.440
<v Speaker 2>Junior dos santos does not fucking give </v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

3109
02:10:42.470 --> 02:10:47.470
<v Speaker 2>That's one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had as many opportunities to give up </v>

3110
02:10:47.470 --> 02:10:48.410
<v Speaker 2>as a human being ever gets in Life and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he will not give up.</v>

3111
02:10:48.440 --> 02:10:49.130
<v Speaker 2>It's tough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3112
02:10:49.131 --> 02:10:50.660
<v Speaker 2>And I think about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

3113
02:10:50.680 --> 02:10:54.140
<v Speaker 2>it's tough because if junior came five </v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago,</v>

3114
02:10:54.141 --> 02:10:56.450
<v Speaker 2>he's not dealing with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's the champ for a long time,</v>

3115
02:10:56.750 --> 02:11:00.920
<v Speaker 2>but because there's this group of guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's about matchups.</v>

3116
02:11:00.950 --> 02:11:04.100
<v Speaker 2>Ufc is about matchups cain velasquez,</v>
<v Speaker 2>junior.</v>

3117
02:11:04.101 --> 02:11:06.230
<v Speaker 2>Dos santos junior will never beat them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3118
02:11:06.231 --> 02:11:07.910
<v Speaker 2>He got that one lucky shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Other than that,</v>

3119
02:11:08.150 --> 02:11:11.270
<v Speaker 2>those guys fight 100 times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Canes went in [inaudible] 99.</v>

3120
02:11:11.271 --> 02:11:12.590
<v Speaker 2>Usually he just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just.</v>

3121
02:11:13.220 --> 02:11:15.800
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if junior fights verdugo,</v>

3122
02:11:15.830 --> 02:11:17.390
<v Speaker 2>travis brown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's probably gonna win.</v>

3123
02:11:17.540 --> 02:11:21.050
<v Speaker 2>It's just matchups man who is a better </v>
<v Speaker 2>match up for you for doom or,</v>

3124
02:11:21.051 --> 02:11:21.980
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or um,</v>

3125
02:11:22.300 --> 02:11:23.240
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>alice drove,</v>

3126
02:11:23.780 --> 02:11:25.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's random as hell.</v>

3127
02:11:25.730 --> 02:11:28.010
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or who's,</v>

3128
02:11:28.090 --> 02:11:29.030
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3129
02:11:29.070 --> 02:11:34.070
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you see a guy like allister that was </v>

3130
02:11:34.070 --> 02:11:34.700
<v Speaker 2>at a very high level and kickboxing came</v>
<v Speaker 2>over,</v>

3131
02:11:34.701 --> 02:11:36.710
<v Speaker 2>fought lesnar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>looked fantastic,</v>

3132
02:11:36.950 --> 02:11:40.730
<v Speaker 2>but then you see him in the big foot </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight post getting popped.</v>

3133
02:11:41.060 --> 02:11:43.730
<v Speaker 2>He got popped for testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You seem in the bigfoot fight.</v>

3134
02:11:43.731 --> 02:11:45.140
<v Speaker 2>and then you see him in the travis brown</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>

3135
02:11:45.260 --> 02:11:48.110
<v Speaker 2>How much do you think he's lost from not</v>
<v Speaker 2>having?</v>

3136
02:11:48.140 --> 02:11:51.320
<v Speaker 2>This is the thing though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he's destroying these guys,</v>

3137
02:11:51.370 --> 02:11:56.370
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you don't want to be that guy </v>

3138
02:11:56.370 --> 02:11:56.370
<v Speaker 2>in the first two minutes fighting </v>
<v Speaker 2>alistair overeem.</v>

3139
02:11:56.370 --> 02:12:00.530
<v Speaker 2>It is a nightmare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he didn't fight that way against me </v>

3140
02:12:00.530 --> 02:12:00.860
<v Speaker 2>or against me or he was very controlled.</v>

3141
02:12:00.890 --> 02:12:03.140
<v Speaker 2>Thanks for that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They mirror.</v>

3142
02:12:04.250 --> 02:12:06.440
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck are we doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did you do?</v>

3143
02:12:06.441 --> 02:12:08.690
<v Speaker 2>All training camp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are we doing?</v>

3144
02:12:08.780 --> 02:12:11.450
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you did nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you say?</v>

3145
02:12:11.470 --> 02:12:13.130
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't throw a punch.</v>

3146
02:12:13.430 --> 02:12:14.820
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he could hit him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3147
02:12:14.821 --> 02:12:17.700
<v Speaker 2>I think he was having a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do something,</v>

3148
02:12:17.720 --> 02:12:20.030
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder what the game plan was.</v>

3149
02:12:20.120 --> 02:12:21.310
<v Speaker 2>I would love to hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet.</v>

3150
02:12:21.410 --> 02:12:24.380
<v Speaker 2>I bet the game plan was figured out how </v>
<v Speaker 2>to tire him out and get them down to the</v>

3151
02:12:24.381 --> 02:12:25.930
<v Speaker 2>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet that was probably the game plan.</v>

3152
02:12:25.931 --> 02:12:29.210
<v Speaker 2>Stay on the outside was be very </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative.</v>

3153
02:12:29.260 --> 02:12:34.260
<v Speaker 2>Don't gas out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And [inaudible] is also controlling on </v>

3154
02:12:34.260 --> 02:12:34.260
<v Speaker 2>the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3155
02:12:34.260 --> 02:12:35.150
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't afraid of going to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>controller the heck out of them,</v>

3156
02:12:35.360 --> 02:12:36.590
<v Speaker 2>which is pretty shocking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3157
02:12:36.591 --> 02:12:39.650
<v Speaker 2>ran frank's a hell of a grappler and </v>
<v Speaker 2>really good off his back.</v>

3158
02:12:39.800 --> 02:12:41.040
<v Speaker 2>People forget that.</v>

3427
02:23:55.050 --> 02:23:55.050
<v Speaker 3>story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did,</v>

3428
02:23:55.050 --> 02:23:58.100
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't know him so I didn't know </v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>talk to them and now.</v>

3431
02:23:59.760 --> 02:24:01.100
<v Speaker 3>Now I know he loves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's.</v>

3432

<v Speaker 3>He's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's gone back to the porno stars </v>

3433
02:24:06.370 --> 02:24:09.261
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got a buddy who'S dating what he did </v>

3434
02:24:09.261 --> 02:24:10.620
<v Speaker 3>during the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so like made you a fighter and a kid.</v>

3439
02:24:20.681 --> 02:24:25.681

3440
02:24:25.681 --> 02:24:25.681
<v Speaker 3>because we get serious people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

<v Speaker 3>I don't want to have a conversation when</v>

<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

3503
02:26:45.960 --> 02:26:47.830
<v Speaker 2>the camp at the end and everybody was </v>
<v Speaker 2>safe,</v>

3504
02:26:48.400 --> 02:26:50.440
<v Speaker 2>but those monsters is way scarier than </v>
<v Speaker 2>the walking dead.</v>

3505
02:26:51.010 --> 02:26:52.300
<v Speaker 2>Dead.</v>

02:26:52.301 --> 02:26:54.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to run everywhere they </v>
<v Speaker 2>walk in.</v>

3507
02:26:54.400 --> 02:26:57.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to run it my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to cut down to about one 70.</v>

3508
02:26:57.910 --> 02:27:02.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a nice pair of kicks and I'm just </v>

<v Speaker 2>cardio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That shows a little too moody for me.</v>

3511
02:27:08.080 --> 02:27:10.000
<v Speaker 2>It's getting ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're eating people now.</v>

3512
02:27:10.001 --> 02:27:12.700
<v Speaker 2>It's like they've found a cannibal </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking colony.</v>

3513
02:27:13.020 --> 02:27:16.330
<v Speaker 2>it makes sense I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's plenty of deer left to.</v>

3514
02:27:16.331 --> 02:27:18.680
<v Speaker 2>It's not like the zombies are eating </v>
<v Speaker 2>deer or they eat a few of them,</v>

3515
02:27:18.681 --> 02:27:23.681
<v Speaker 2>but they can't catch him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand why everybody gets </v>

3516
02:27:23.681 --> 02:27:24.250
<v Speaker 2>guns when he could have a sword.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's good to have guns,</v>

3517
02:27:24.251 --> 02:27:27.350
<v Speaker 2>but that chick never gets fucked with </v>
<v Speaker 2>jacks.</v>

02:27:27.560 --> 02:27:29.860
<v Speaker 2>Everything will you run out of bullets </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a sword.</v>

<v Speaker 2>The rifle.</v>

3521
02:27:33.370 --> 02:27:38.370
<v Speaker 2>It takes a couple of seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You gotta fucking 100 zombies coming at </v>

3522
02:27:38.370 --> 02:27:41.611

3523
02:27:41.611 --> 02:27:43.621
<v Speaker 2>in the chamber.</v>

02:28:27.040 --> 02:28:28.520
<v Speaker 2>chimps and gets into people and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>spreads like wildfire.</v>

3541
02:28:28.750 --> 02:28:32.780
<v Speaker 2>When you think about what rabies does to</v>
<v Speaker 2>to animals and people and people,</v>

<v Speaker 2>near a body of water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they get near a body of water,</v>

3544

<v Speaker 2>they get so hysterical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to chain them down.</v>

3587
02:30:18.951 --> 02:30:23.951
<v Speaker 2>to a set of symptoms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The later stages of an infection with </v>

3604
02:31:02.720 --> 02:31:06.620
<v Speaker 2>That is the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your whole body seizes up and before you</v>

3605
02:31:06.621 --> 02:31:11.621
<v Speaker 2>die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're very acutely aware of all the </v>

3606
02:31:11.621 --> 02:31:13.211
<v Speaker 2>pain that he didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see this shit where a jon jones is </v>

3607
02:31:13.211 --> 02:31:13.670
<v Speaker 2>requesting that glover to share,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get drug tested?</v>

3608
02:31:14.270 --> 02:31:16.640
<v Speaker 2>Oh no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of fascinating.</v>

3609
02:31:16.970 --> 02:31:17.750
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3610
02:31:17.751 --> 02:31:19.890
<v Speaker 2>agree to a lot of testing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3611
02:31:19.980 --> 02:31:23.070
<v Speaker 1>this is what he says.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is exact quote is some fighters you</v>

3612
02:31:23.071 --> 02:31:25.530
<v Speaker 1>just know they're not on anything just </v>
<v Speaker 1>by looking at them.</v>

3613
02:31:25.800 --> 02:31:30.800
<v Speaker 1>I kind of disagree with that because </v>
<v Speaker 1>like guys like that look like Jeremy </v>

3614
02:31:30.800 --> 02:31:33.120
<v Speaker 1>Horn who doesn't look like he's on </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything who have tested positive,</v>

3615
02:31:33.270 --> 02:31:38.270
<v Speaker 1>like just because a guy has like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain body type doesn't mean that he </v>

3616
02:31:38.270 --> 02:31:39.180
<v Speaker 1>can't be on something like got a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys have tested positive.</v>

3617
02:31:40.220 --> 02:31:43.260
<v Speaker 1>I think you're taLking about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>exception there again perhaps,</v>

3618
02:31:43.380 --> 02:31:45.900
<v Speaker 1>but those are often the guys that wand </v>
<v Speaker 1>up taking it like,</v>

3619
02:31:45.960 --> 02:31:47.070
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a perfect example,</v>

3620
02:31:47.100 --> 02:31:49.780
<v Speaker 1>tim silvia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's tips a lot of folks don't know,</v>

3621
02:31:49.781 --> 02:31:53.370
<v Speaker 1>like tim silvia tested hot and before </v>
<v Speaker 1>tim silvia tested hot.</v>

3622
02:31:53.371 --> 02:31:55.680
<v Speaker 1>Like look at what he looked like when he</v>
<v Speaker 1>fought rico rodriguez.</v>

3623
02:31:56.010 --> 02:32:01.010
<v Speaker 1>I think that tim silvia that beat rico </v>
<v Speaker 1>rodriguez is one of the scariest </v>

3624
02:32:01.010 --> 02:32:01.170
<v Speaker 1>heavYweights ever.</v>

3625
02:32:01.200 --> 02:32:03.230
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tim silvia takedown defense,</v>

3626
02:32:03.620 --> 02:32:06.430
<v Speaker 1>great strategies to righthand monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just,</v>

3627
02:32:06.480 --> 02:32:11.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he couldn't keep that fucking hanging </v>

3628
02:32:11.480 --> 02:32:15.060
<v Speaker 1>off the side and I think he was getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>criticized for it and I feel like that's</v>

3629
02:32:15.061 --> 02:32:17.130
<v Speaker 1>why I did steroid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're right.</v>

3630
02:32:17.220 --> 02:32:18.090
<v Speaker 1>I think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3631
02:32:18.091 --> 02:32:19.930
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd always wanted to sell it to me.</v>

3632
02:32:20.170 --> 02:32:25.170
<v Speaker 1>he wanted to look the part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little embarrassed of his body a </v>

3633
02:32:25.170 --> 02:32:26.130
<v Speaker 1>little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I also think that it benefited him.</v>

3634
02:32:26.190 --> 02:32:30.150
<v Speaker 1>It benefited him physically the way he </v>
<v Speaker 1>would pull up a pull up.</v>

3635
02:32:30.151 --> 02:32:35.151
<v Speaker 1>Tim silvia versus rico rodriguez.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's tim when he was retired from the </v>

3636
02:32:36.181 --> 02:32:38.730
<v Speaker 1>ufc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's tim versus rico rodriguez.</v>

3637
02:32:39.120 --> 02:32:40.590
<v Speaker 1>you see that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That image.</v>

02:32:40.620 --> 02:32:44.460
<v Speaker 1>Look how fucking leni wasn't big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was dangerous motherfucker and he was</v>

3639
02:32:44.461 --> 02:32:46.890
<v Speaker 1>eating rico's leg kicks and dropping </v>
<v Speaker 1>right hands on.</v>

3640
02:32:47.250 --> 02:32:49.080
<v Speaker 1>Plus the video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you could find the video.</v>

3641
02:32:49.350 --> 02:32:51.090
<v Speaker 1>He.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a scary guy because he.</v>

3642
02:32:51.120 --> 02:32:56.120
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he also struggled to get down to two 65 </v>

3643
02:32:56.120 --> 02:32:56.730
<v Speaker 1>for that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was drawing to get down to,</v>

3644
02:32:56.731 --> 02:32:58.760
<v Speaker 1>to see ms dot wait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He missed wait the first time.</v>

3645
02:32:58.810 --> 02:33:01.380
<v Speaker 1>Walked around that I don't know him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was big.</v>

3646
02:33:01.381 --> 02:33:03.680
<v Speaker 1>So john saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not religious big,</v>

3647
02:33:03.860 --> 02:33:06.210
<v Speaker 1>not fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but big shoulders and neck.</v>

3648
02:33:06.240 --> 02:33:07.380
<v Speaker 1>Such a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3651
02:33:15.811 --> 02:33:20.811
<v Speaker 1>questioned it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no reason to think he's on </v>

3652
02:33:20.811 --> 02:33:23.301
<v Speaker 1>steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do wonder how someone can be so </v>

3653
02:33:23.301 --> 02:33:23.301
<v Speaker 1>strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

3654
02:33:23.450 --> 02:33:27.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure I have fought guys in the past </v>
<v Speaker 1>that were on steroids.</v>

3655
02:33:27.031 --> 02:33:32.031
<v Speaker 1>I Think it's pretty well documented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people haven't really argued </v>

3656
02:33:32.031 --> 02:33:33.780
<v Speaker 1>with it because they know it's true </v>
<v Speaker 1>statement.</v>

3657
02:33:33.840 --> 02:33:35.100
<v Speaker 1>I know it's a true statement.</v>

3658
02:33:35.100 --> 02:33:40.100
<v Speaker 1>I called dana white and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want glover to take steroid tests for </v>

3659
02:33:40.100 --> 02:33:40.290
<v Speaker 1>this fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He asked me,</v>

3660
02:33:40.470 --> 02:33:42.000
<v Speaker 1>what do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's on steroids,</v>

3661
02:33:42.060 --> 02:33:43.830
<v Speaker 1>and I told him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3662
02:33:43.831 --> 02:33:46.140
<v Speaker 1>I have no reason to accuse him of </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>

3663
02:33:46.260 --> 02:33:50.100
<v Speaker 1>but I would like to be sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can you be mad at that?</v>

3664
02:33:50.190 --> 02:33:53.880
<v Speaker 1>You can't be mad at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not mad at that at all,</v>

3665
02:33:53.980 --> 02:33:55.260
<v Speaker 1>and if he came out and was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3666
02:33:55.261 --> 02:33:56.730
<v Speaker 1>glover's on stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

3667
02:33:57.220 --> 02:33:57.990
<v Speaker 1>there's tim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sylvia,</v>

3668
02:33:57.991 --> 02:34:00.960
<v Speaker 1>when he fought rico.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3669
02:34:00.990 --> 02:34:05.990
<v Speaker 1>Look at that big motherfucker to rico.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Had a good guard to man are legitimate </v>

3670
02:34:06.061 --> 02:34:09.720
<v Speaker 1>shadow black belt for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tim silvia was scary back then,</v>

3671
02:34:09.721 --> 02:34:12.510
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Super scary and he knocked a lot of guys</v>

3672
02:34:12.511 --> 02:34:12.870
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

3673
02:34:13.040 --> 02:34:18.040
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people sleep on tim silvia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He never gets brought up because he had </v>

3674
02:34:18.040 --> 02:34:18.040
<v Speaker 1>sort of a dispute with ufc,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

3675
02:34:18.040 --> 02:34:23.040
<v Speaker 2>head kick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trade telemann knocked him out and tim </v>

3676
02:34:23.040 --> 02:34:23.170
<v Speaker 2>silvia was not a natural athlete by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

3677
02:34:23.440 --> 02:34:26.590
<v Speaker 2>This is all from toughness in training </v>
<v Speaker 2>mean pigeon toed.</v>

3678
02:34:26.591 --> 02:34:31.591
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his feet like naturally went towards </v>

3679
02:34:31.591 --> 02:34:31.750
<v Speaker 2>each other and here he stuffs to take </v>
<v Speaker 2>down again,</v>

3680
02:34:32.650 --> 02:34:36.310
<v Speaker 2>rough sum up on the ground and tim </v>
<v Speaker 2>silvia back then,</v>

3681
02:34:36.520 --> 02:34:37.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3682
02:34:37.211 --> 02:34:42.211
<v Speaker 2>you're dealing with a guy who really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is good fucking high guard has </v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3684
02:34:42.401 --> 02:34:45.280
<v Speaker 2>And it's like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>legit brazilian jiu jitsu,</v>

3685
02:34:45.281 --> 02:34:46.690
<v Speaker 2>black belt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very high level.</v>

3686
02:34:47.230 --> 02:34:49.180
<v Speaker 2>Especially at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3687
02:34:49.181 --> 02:34:54.181
<v Speaker 2>at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rico was one of very few brazilian </v>

3688
02:34:54.181 --> 02:34:54.430
<v Speaker 2>jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>black belts in the heavyweight division.</v>

3689
02:34:54.640 --> 02:34:59.640
<v Speaker 2>There wasn't a lot of guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see them sitting noguera's guard </v>

3690
02:34:59.640 --> 02:34:59.640
<v Speaker 2>risk control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

<v Speaker 2>of the scariest guys.</v>

3694
02:35:04.361 --> 02:35:05.920
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you,</v>

<v Speaker 2>credits like the shame he is fit as </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck.</v>

3769
02:38:04.541 --> 02:38:08.720
<v Speaker 2>It's the opposite came because cain is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>freak of nature,</v>

3770
02:38:08.721 --> 02:38:13.721
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He really is a freak of nature when it </v>

3771
02:38:13.721 --> 02:38:13.721
<v Speaker 2>comes to his cardio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You talked to bob cook,</v>

3772
02:38:13.721 --> 02:38:14.000
<v Speaker 2>he says it came will take like a month </v>
<v Speaker 2>off.</v>

3773
02:38:14.001 --> 02:38:15.530
<v Speaker 2>Get injured.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come back in,</v>

3774
02:38:15.531 --> 02:38:17.360
<v Speaker 2>outwork everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it doesn't make any sense,</v>

3775
02:38:17.370 --> 02:38:22.370
<v Speaker 2>like he doesn't have these like breaking</v>
<v Speaker 2>periods where he has to get back in </v>

3776
02:38:22.370 --> 02:38:22.590
<v Speaker 2>shape and some of that is just genetic </v>
<v Speaker 2>slips,</v>

3777
02:38:22.650 --> 02:38:25.400
<v Speaker 2>just like some people have incredible </v>
<v Speaker 2>fast twitch muscle fiber.</v>

3778
02:38:25.550 --> 02:38:27.350
<v Speaker 2>We've met guys that have never lifted </v>
<v Speaker 2>weights in there.</v>

3779
02:38:27.351 --> 02:38:30.690
<v Speaker 2>Fucking gigantic pick cafs and shit like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't even a.</v>

3780
02:38:30.910 --> 02:38:33.950
<v Speaker 2>But look at cane I w I wouldn't say </v>
<v Speaker 2>canes really explosive.</v>

3781
02:38:33.951 --> 02:38:38.951
<v Speaker 2>He kinda has that softer body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas the insurance is going to be </v>

3782
02:38:38.951 --> 02:38:38.951
<v Speaker 2>higher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's 100 percent genetics.</v>

3783
02:38:38.951 --> 02:38:41.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well he definitely doesn't have the same</v>

3784
02:38:41.151 --> 02:38:43.300
<v Speaker 2>kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You guys like hector lumbar,</v>

3785
02:38:43.330 --> 02:38:45.740
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's just jack to the gills.</v>

3786
02:38:45.741 --> 02:38:47.800
<v Speaker 2>His ears have fricking traps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3787
02:38:47.801 --> 02:38:50.840
<v Speaker 2>you just like swole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All explosiveness.</v>

3788
02:38:51.080 --> 02:38:53.030
<v Speaker 2>Nolan's more explosive than hector.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

3789
02:38:53.060 --> 02:38:56.510
<v Speaker 2>He's the most explosive guy that's ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>fought in mma right up there with melvin</v>

3790
02:38:56.560 --> 02:39:01.560
<v Speaker 2>manhoef.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's even more exposed to the </v>

3791
02:39:01.560 --> 02:39:01.560
<v Speaker 2>melbourne.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so too,</v>

3792
02:39:01.560 --> 02:39:01.910
<v Speaker 2>because of the judo and they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hector,</v>

3793
02:39:01.940 --> 02:39:06.770
<v Speaker 2>your giant swole muscles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's give you the vegan jake shields.</v>

3794
02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:10.860
<v Speaker 2>Let's see how this goes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fight and fight.</v>

3795
02:39:10.990 --> 02:39:13.430
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jagan steroids on its neck.</v>

3796
02:39:13.480 --> 02:39:17.330
<v Speaker 2>Jake caught his neck with the last </v>
<v Speaker 2>remaining second fight was hanging on.</v>

3797
02:39:17.331 --> 02:39:21.230
<v Speaker 2>Jake's got a god damn vice for a grip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When he gets that good team,</v>

3798
02:39:21.231 --> 02:39:26.231
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he tightened that shit up on robbie </v>

3799
02:39:26.231 --> 02:39:27.641
<v Speaker 2>lawler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He tightens that shit up on everybody </v>

3800
02:39:27.641 --> 02:39:27.641
<v Speaker 2>and you don't think he's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>able to get it.</v>

3801
02:39:27.641 --> 02:39:28.660
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a lot of guys think they </v>
<v Speaker 2>can get out of that.</v>

3802
02:39:28.670 --> 02:39:29.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jake jacobs strong.</v>

3803
02:39:30.080 --> 02:39:32.300
<v Speaker 2>Going to train with them on friday and </v>
<v Speaker 2>san francisco.</v>

3804
02:39:32.610 --> 02:39:37.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm hector lombard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Motherfucker hit some judo throws in </v>

3805
02:39:37.610 --> 02:39:41.470
<v Speaker 2>this light against jake shields that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like a ragdoll them.</v>

3806
02:39:41.480 --> 02:39:43.280
<v Speaker 2>If ever there's a reason why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey dad,</v>

3807
02:39:43.281 --> 02:39:45.020
<v Speaker 2>why can't I look at this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boom,</v>

3808
02:39:45.200 --> 02:39:50.200
<v Speaker 2>why watch that again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just back that up again and just back </v>

3809
02:39:50.200 --> 02:39:53.991
<v Speaker 2>that up to that judo toss to back it up </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the way to do this in a world class </v>

3810
02:39:54.291 --> 02:39:57.800
<v Speaker 2>grappler like jake shields is just </v>
<v Speaker 2>insane.</v>

3811
02:39:57.830 --> 02:40:01.550
<v Speaker 2>Watch this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He does it so beautifully.</v>

3812
02:40:01.551 --> 02:40:06.551
<v Speaker 2>Perfect technique and speed and he's one</v>
<v Speaker 2>of those storms of like athleticism and </v>

3813
02:40:07.821 --> 02:40:12.821
<v Speaker 2>technique and really started striking </v>
<v Speaker 2>once he was already an olympic judo.</v>

3814
02:40:14.320 --> 02:40:19.320
<v Speaker 1>That's when he started striking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he prefers to keep fight standing </v>

3815
02:40:19.320 --> 02:40:21.580
<v Speaker 1>just because he's such a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>specimen.</v>

3816
02:40:21.610 --> 02:40:22.560
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you won't be a vegan.</v>

3817
02:40:22.590 --> 02:40:24.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to play that tape for you,</v>

3818
02:40:24.240 --> 02:40:26.250
<v Speaker 1>but be here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watch this fight.</v>

3819
02:40:26.360 --> 02:40:31.360
<v Speaker 1>Like in all fairness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you talk about a style like jake </v>

3820
02:40:31.360 --> 02:40:31.360
<v Speaker 1>shields is kinda like what we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about could be a worse match up.</v>

3821
02:40:31.630 --> 02:40:33.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were trying to get rid of them.</v>

3822
02:40:33.270 --> 02:40:38.270
<v Speaker 1>Well I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were just trying to give him a </v>

3823
02:40:38.270 --> 02:40:38.270
<v Speaker 1>fight that was going to be a really </v>
<v Speaker 1>tough fight.</v>

3824
02:40:38.270 --> 02:40:38.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just,</v>

3825
02:40:38.940 --> 02:40:41.400
<v Speaker 1>it's like if you want to be in the top </v>
<v Speaker 1>10 and he wanted a title shot,</v>

3826
02:40:41.401 --> 02:40:44.400
<v Speaker 1>like if he beat book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if he caught him with that team the</v>

3827
02:40:44.401 --> 02:40:46.380
<v Speaker 1>first round and finished it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3828
02:40:46.530 --> 02:40:49.020
<v Speaker 1>he's likely in the short list for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>title shot.</v>

3829
02:40:49.220 --> 02:40:52.570
<v Speaker 1>If he could finish a guy basically five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'd be $500.</v>

3830
02:40:52.571 --> 02:40:56.670
<v Speaker 1>You see a guy like hector lumbar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that style of fucking sprinting.</v>

3831
02:40:56.790 --> 02:41:00.860
<v Speaker 1>You can't do it for three rounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can do it for five rounds.</v>

3832
02:41:01.230 --> 02:41:03.260
<v Speaker 1>Fight tyron woodley,</v>
<v Speaker 1>woodley.</v>

3833
02:41:03.880 --> 02:41:08.880
<v Speaker 1>He's fighting rory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rory mcdonald versus willie's a </v>

3834
02:41:08.880 --> 02:41:12.321
<v Speaker 1>fantastic fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if the rory that beat damien </v>

3835
02:41:12.321 --> 02:41:14.340
<v Speaker 1>maia shows up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If rory is motivated and aggressive,</v>

3836
02:41:14.700 --> 02:41:16.470
<v Speaker 1>he's gotta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get the fuck away from woodland.</v>

3837
02:41:16.471 --> 02:41:19.530
<v Speaker 1>That first round though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>buddy and woodley.</v>

3838
02:41:19.531 --> 02:41:20.160
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3839
02:41:20.250 --> 02:41:24.420
<v Speaker 1>woodley can move as fast as any fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>human being in the ufc.</v>

3840
02:41:24.421 --> 02:41:27.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't care if the 135 pounds at one </v>
<v Speaker 1>70,</v>

3841
02:41:27.181 --> 02:41:29.460
<v Speaker 1>that fucking dude can move like a fast </v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

3842
02:41:29.461 --> 02:41:31.200
<v Speaker 1>30 five is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that explosive.</v>

3843
02:41:31.201 --> 02:41:36.201
<v Speaker 1>He's as big as you can ever get and be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>world class hundred and 70 pounder.</v>

3844
02:41:37.120 --> 02:41:38.760
<v Speaker 1>And it's an interesting situation </v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

3845
02:41:39.270 --> 02:41:39.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

3846
02:41:40.030 --> 02:41:41.290
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3847
02:41:41.310 --> 02:41:43.650
<v Speaker 1>there was debate after I talked about it</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the,</v>

3848
02:41:43.651 --> 02:41:46.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the broadcast about this body type.</v>

3849
02:41:46.650 --> 02:41:49.380
<v Speaker 1>It has its benefits for sure as far as </v>
<v Speaker 1>explosion and speed,</v>

3850
02:41:49.590 --> 02:41:53.520
<v Speaker 1>but it also has a lot of requirements </v>
<v Speaker 1>like for oxygen.</v>

3851
02:41:53.521 --> 02:41:54.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

3852
02:41:54.361 --> 02:41:59.361
<v Speaker 1>can a guy take it deep into the rounds?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens if a guy survives fourth </v>

3853
02:41:59.361 --> 02:42:00.630
<v Speaker 1>and fifth?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because when nate beat them,</v>

3854
02:42:00.631 --> 02:42:05.631
<v Speaker 1>they beat him in the fourth round.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marquardt stopped him in strikeforce </v>

3855
02:42:05.631 --> 02:42:09.170
<v Speaker 1>welterweight title fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what happened is nate caught </v>

3856
02:42:09.170 --> 02:42:12.440
<v Speaker 1>him slowing down and nate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nate then was before he's had a couple </v>

3857
02:42:12.440 --> 02:42:14.610
<v Speaker 1>of these bad knockouts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the knockout against hector,</v>

3858
02:42:14.611 --> 02:42:19.611
<v Speaker 1>lumbar toughest to get knocked out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was when he fought tyron woodley.</v>

3859
02:42:19.681 --> 02:42:24.681
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about nate marquardt who </v>
<v Speaker 1>was at his best and but it's back </v>

3860
02:42:24.681 --> 02:42:25.130
<v Speaker 1>against the wall too because he had been</v>
<v Speaker 1>kicked out of the ufc,</v>

3861
02:42:25.650 --> 02:42:30.650
<v Speaker 1>finally gets back into strikeforce and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he gets a shot at the title at </v>

3862
02:42:30.650 --> 02:42:31.230
<v Speaker 1>strikeforce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a big fight and you know,</v>

3863
02:42:31.231 --> 02:42:32.370
<v Speaker 1>nate was primed.</v>

3864
02:42:32.400 --> 02:42:33.810
<v Speaker 1>It was in his prime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

3865
02:42:33.811 --> 02:42:38.811
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

<v Speaker 1>But it's like what we were talking about</v>

3868

<v Speaker 2>that could move that fast until </v>

3880
02:43:17.250 --> 02:43:21.571
<v Speaker 2>recently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one existed in the ufc like within </v>

3881
02:43:21.571 --> 02:43:21.571
<v Speaker 2>the last five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six years.</v>

3882
02:43:21.571 --> 02:43:25.381
<v Speaker 2>You're starting to see these guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>trickle in that have that kind of </v>

3883
02:43:25.381 --> 02:43:25.480
<v Speaker 2>explosion of that kind of athleticism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that kind of speed.</v>

3884
02:43:25.720 --> 02:43:27.460
<v Speaker 2>And hector is right up there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Heck,</v>

3885
02:43:27.490 --> 02:43:32.490
<v Speaker 2>it's like hector entirely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like as someone who analyzes </v>

3886
02:43:32.490 --> 02:43:34.630
<v Speaker 2>fights and it analyzes like there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>point of diminishing returns,</v>

3887
02:43:34.631 --> 02:43:39.631
<v Speaker 2>like what's the best body type?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it super muscular like hector </v>

3888
02:43:39.631 --> 02:43:41.050
<v Speaker 2>lombard?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or is it like a carlos condit guy that's</v>

3889
02:43:41.051 --> 02:43:43.960
<v Speaker 2>super durable and king last round after </v>
<v Speaker 2>round,</v>

3890
02:43:44.210 --> 02:43:45.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the woodley fight,</v>

3891
02:43:45.221 --> 02:43:48.430
<v Speaker 2>we saw woodley one me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he fucked up tyrons knee.</v>

3892
02:43:48.431 --> 02:43:49.480
<v Speaker 2>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But look,</v>

3893
02:43:49.630 --> 02:43:51.640
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't really a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His leg fell off,</v>

3894
02:43:51.670 --> 02:43:56.670
<v Speaker 2>his leg got hurt in the take down and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then he heard it again when he led </v>

3895
02:43:56.670 --> 02:43:56.670
<v Speaker 2>kitchen.</v>

3896
02:43:56.670 --> 02:43:59.170
<v Speaker 2>It's not the same as him beating him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like with no injuries,</v>

3897
02:43:59.171 --> 02:44:02.280
<v Speaker 2>but the bottom line is he wins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wins j.</v>

3898
02:44:02.310 --> 02:44:03.070
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't,</v>

3899
02:44:03.280 --> 02:44:04.720
<v Speaker 2>you can't really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

3900
02:44:04.721 --> 02:44:08.410
<v Speaker 2>Like you can't quantify it the same way </v>
<v Speaker 2>as a knockout or submission.</v>

3901
02:44:08.560 --> 02:44:11.230
<v Speaker 2>It's similar to cane versus brock </v>
<v Speaker 2>lesnar.</v>

3902
02:44:11.320 --> 02:44:14.450
<v Speaker 2>One guy's just swole to the gills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other guy,</v>

3903
02:44:14.620 --> 02:44:16.060
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you saw him with his shirt off,</v>

3904
02:44:16.061 --> 02:44:21.061
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no way you're the best except </v>

3905
02:44:21.061 --> 02:44:21.061
<v Speaker 2>the fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3906
02:44:21.061 --> 02:44:21.370
<v Speaker 2>would they was still there in the second</v>
<v Speaker 2>round,</v>

3907
02:44:21.510 --> 02:44:23.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's still going at it in the second</v>

3908
02:44:23.261 --> 02:44:23.800
<v Speaker 2>round,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

3909
02:44:23.801 --> 02:44:24.340
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right,</v>

3910
02:44:24.341 --> 02:44:29.341
<v Speaker 2>you're right about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's gotta be a balance like too </v>

3911
02:44:29.341 --> 02:44:29.790
<v Speaker 2>muscular has its liabilities and there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>a.</v>

3912
02:44:29.890 --> 02:44:34.890
<v Speaker 2>It's like they had that debate about </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the perfect way for the </v>

3913
02:44:34.890 --> 02:44:34.890
<v Speaker 2>heavyweight boxer?</v>

3914
02:44:34.890 --> 02:44:36.370
<v Speaker 2>When you get to a certain weight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you start losing speed and power.</v>

3915
02:44:37.050 --> 02:44:38.770
<v Speaker 2>So is it 2:30,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2:40</v>

3916
02:44:38.800 --> 02:44:40.240
<v Speaker 2>2:35?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It depends on the body.</v>

3917
02:44:40.270 --> 02:44:42.030
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think bo jackson tell you what number.</v>

3918
02:44:42.070 --> 02:44:44.270
<v Speaker 2>Bo jackson at 2:45.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That freaky ashlyn.</v>

3919
02:44:44.670 --> 02:44:49.480
<v Speaker 2>He would have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would have been probably the,</v>

3920
02:44:49.600 --> 02:44:52.360
<v Speaker 2>that's probably the optimal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the optimal.</v>

3921
02:44:52.361 --> 02:44:53.870
<v Speaker 2>And you know what he does now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bow hunts.</v>

3922
02:44:54.240 --> 02:44:54.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he does.</v>

3923
02:44:54.910 --> 02:44:57.040
<v Speaker 2>That's his shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Talked to him about hunting for.</v>

3924
02:44:57.130 --> 02:44:57.810
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3925
02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:02.710
<v Speaker 2>About two hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you live in jackson?</v>

3926
02:45:02.711 --> 02:45:07.711
<v Speaker 2>That's what you talked about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hunting and he talks about he wants to </v>

3927
02:45:07.711 --> 02:45:07.711
<v Speaker 2>talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what,</v>

3928
02:45:07.711 --> 02:45:08.790
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what he wants to talk about.</v>

3929
02:45:09.060 --> 02:45:12.160
<v Speaker 2>Like he's obsessed with the way we </v>
<v Speaker 2>talked about football and baseball too.</v>

3930
02:45:12.220 --> 02:45:15.780

3935
02:45:19.150 --> 02:45:20.890

<v Speaker 2>He was about six to 2:45</v>

3936
02:45:20.920 --> 02:45:21.670
<v Speaker 2>then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

3937
02:45:21.671 --> 02:45:22.660
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I said,</v>

3938
02:45:22.960 --> 02:45:24.450
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

3939

<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just scrapped it all and I just go in </v>

02:45:29.610 --> 02:45:29.610
<v Speaker 2>there and I'd hear them whispering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>posted the game post in the game.</v>

3941
02:45:29.610 --> 02:45:30.840
<v Speaker 2>He was just run through to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

3942
02:45:30.850 --> 02:45:32.620
<v Speaker 2>baseball is way harder than he thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>

3943
02:45:32.621 --> 02:45:35.710
<v Speaker 2>As he thought of it as a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very cerebral game.</v>

3944
02:45:35.711 --> 02:45:37.440
<v Speaker 2>Way more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's bowhunting.</v>

<v Speaker 2>it back at night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's about an inch high.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Oh no.</v>

4026
02:49:23.911 --> 02:49:26.550
<v Speaker 2>Somebody says exercise is always been a </v>
<v Speaker 2>religion to him.</v>

4027
02:49:26.551 --> 02:49:26.720
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>like multiple personality disorder.</v>

4030
02:49:33.390 --> 02:49:34.800
<v Speaker 2>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4031
02:49:34.801 --> 02:49:37.410
<v Speaker 2>he had something that was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard about this.</v>

4032
02:49:37.411 --> 02:49:42.411
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was going on before he had an mma </v>

4033
02:49:42.411 --> 02:49:42.411
<v Speaker 2>career and everybody was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute.</v>

4034
02:49:42.411 --> 02:49:44.160
<v Speaker 2>If he's had a trauma related,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4035
02:49:44.190 --> 02:49:47.310
<v Speaker 2>multiple personality disorder here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll pull that up.</v>

4036
02:49:49.120 --> 02:49:49.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

4037
02:49:49.931 --> 02:49:51.580
<v Speaker 2>Mercy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>multiple personality disorder.</v>

4038
02:49:51.581 --> 02:49:52.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

4039
02:49:52.451 --> 02:49:53.800
<v Speaker 2>um.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they started fighting,</v>

4040
02:49:54.220 --> 02:49:54.660
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4041
02:49:54.690 --> 02:49:55.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm bipolar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

4042
02:49:55.960 --> 02:49:57.510
<v Speaker 2>let's take punches to the face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4043
02:49:57.520 --> 02:50:02.520
<v Speaker 2>It's cnn Way back in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When was this article out in 2008.</v>

4044
02:50:03.550 --> 02:50:04.390
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4045
02:50:04.480 --> 02:50:09.480
<v Speaker 2>he put out a book about it and it was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>book about his multiple personalities </v>

4046
02:50:09.480 --> 02:50:12.070
<v Speaker 2>and they believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe it's trauma related.</v>

4047
02:50:12.280 --> 02:50:13.570
<v Speaker 2>I should probably google that too.</v>

4048
02:50:14.020 --> 02:50:16.610
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that,</v>

4049
02:50:17.180 --> 02:50:17.480
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4050
02:50:18.110 --> 02:50:19.820
<v Speaker 2>I'll be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>since I've started fighting,</v>

4051
02:50:19.821 --> 02:50:22.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm a little one more serious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>little,</v>

4052
02:50:22.130 --> 02:50:27.130
<v Speaker 2>little quicker trigger for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If something's getting on my nerves I'm </v>

4053
02:50:27.130 --> 02:50:27.130
<v Speaker 2>with on there with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

4054
02:50:27.130 --> 02:50:29.330
<v Speaker 2>I used to be super more laid back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd say.</v>

4055
02:50:29.600 --> 02:50:34.600
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Says usually has its roots in childhood </v>

4056
02:50:34.600 --> 02:50:34.600
<v Speaker 2>trauma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4057
02:50:34.600 --> 02:50:38.411
<v Speaker 2>So that might not mean head injury.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might mean like abuse child cope with</v>

4058
02:50:39.231 --> 02:50:41.290
<v Speaker 2>trauma or abuse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>hm.</v>

4059
02:50:41.930 --> 02:50:42.620
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

4060
02:50:45.200 --> 02:50:48.380
<v Speaker 2>And also it has to do with ptsd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ptsd.</v>

4061
02:50:48.500 --> 02:50:50.760
<v Speaker 2>So I guess it is talking about abuse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about um,</v>

4062
02:50:51.100 --> 02:50:52.120
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not physical,</v>

4063
02:50:52.130 --> 02:50:52.940
<v Speaker 2>not like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

4064
02:50:52.941 --> 02:50:54.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm being treated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean,</v>

4065
02:50:54.231 --> 02:50:59.231
<v Speaker 2>just think about the amount of head </v>
<v Speaker 2>trauma that you have to get playing </v>

4066
02:50:59.231 --> 02:50:59.231
<v Speaker 2>football at a high level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's unavoidable.</v>

4067
02:50:59.231 --> 02:51:00.680
<v Speaker 2>There's no right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you did it.</v>

4068
02:51:00.710 --> 02:51:02.180
<v Speaker 2>It's unavoidable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unavoidable.</v>

4069
02:51:02.240 --> 02:51:03.890
<v Speaker 2>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's practice.</v>

4070
02:51:04.160 --> 02:51:09.160
<v Speaker 2>It's the practice that does it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many times do you think you got </v>

4071
02:51:09.160 --> 02:51:09.160
<v Speaker 2>concussions while playing football?</v>

4072
02:51:09.590 --> 02:51:11.300
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five or six and not that many.</v>

4073
02:51:11.301 --> 02:51:16.301
<v Speaker 2>I was smart about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're aware of this kind of crazy at </v>

4074
02:51:16.301 --> 02:51:19.720
<v Speaker 2>five or six.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is like a low end for and I played </v>

4075
02:51:19.720 --> 02:51:22.530
<v Speaker 2>fullback h back where your.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See if you guys know the position,</v>

4076
02:51:22.910 --> 02:51:25.780
<v Speaker 2>you're constantly running five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's ridiculous now.</v>

4077
02:51:25.781 --> 02:51:29.000
<v Speaker 2>I think about five yards apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You run as fast as you can into that.</v>

4078
02:51:29.001 --> 02:51:31.340
<v Speaker 2>Go with your head first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I was doing nonstop.</v>

4079
02:51:31.610 --> 02:51:33.560
<v Speaker 2>She christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

4080
02:51:33.770 --> 02:51:35.210
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why wouldn't someone sent me?</v>

4081
02:51:35.211 --> 02:51:36.440
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm like running.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listen man.</v>

4082
02:51:36.650 --> 02:51:39.110
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's beneficial for your </v>
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>

4083
02:51:39.160 --> 02:51:43.150
<v Speaker 2>but you to that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But meanwhile you had success at that.</v>

4084

<v Speaker 2>That lead you to success in college?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4085
02:51:45.380 --> 02:51:45.980

<v Speaker 2>I said to him,</v>

4086
02:51:45.981 --> 02:51:50.981
<v Speaker 2>I asked him if he would have traded his </v>
<v Speaker 2>football career and for training and </v>

4087
02:51:50.981 --> 02:51:53.990
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said no because you could just talk </v>

4088
02:51:53.990 --> 02:51:53.990
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not back then.</v>

<v Speaker 2>learned how to be a dude.</v>

4091
02:51:58.101 --> 02:52:00.230
<v Speaker 2>I was training with killers.</v>
