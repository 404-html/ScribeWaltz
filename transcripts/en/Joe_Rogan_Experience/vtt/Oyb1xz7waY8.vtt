18
00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.530
<v Speaker 1>Like to a certain extent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not too many people I can look</v>

19
00:00:39.531 --> 00:00:41.990
<v Speaker 1>left and right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we,</v>

<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

25
00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:55.640
<v Speaker 1>not really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

26
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.250
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of a weird cold call.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm going to say?</v>

27
00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:03.310
<v Speaker 1>Hey jodie foster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I such a small clan of people,</v>

28
00:01:04.251 --> 00:01:06.790
<v Speaker 1>like if a comic called me that I knew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

29
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.870
<v Speaker 1>and they wanted to talk to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would talk to them.</v>

30
00:01:08.871 --> 00:01:10.820
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's such a small collection of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

31
00:01:10.821 --> 00:01:12.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean we do have our weekly therapy</v>
<v Speaker 1>sessions.</v>

32
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

33
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.790
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Me,</v>

34
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.270
<v Speaker 1>Elijah Wood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

35
00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.340
<v Speaker 1>Jodie Foster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

36
00:01:19.341 --> 00:01:20.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we all get together and yeah,</v>

37
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.860
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

38
00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:22.670
<v Speaker 1>we weep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

39
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.320
<v Speaker 1>it's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do primal screaming.</v>

40
00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.200
<v Speaker 1>That's what we do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was describing when it was like,</v>

41
00:01:27.201 --> 00:01:28.300
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

42
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.930
<v Speaker 1>Ricky Schroeder who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

43
00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:30.793
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

44
00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously it was very famous when he was</v>

45
00:01:32.451 --> 00:01:34.940
<v Speaker 1>young as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of my favorite theme songs,</v>

46
00:01:34.941 --> 00:01:37.070
<v Speaker 1>TV theme songs of all times for spoons.</v>

47
00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.920
<v Speaker 1>And I was saying that the way you</v>
<v Speaker 1>developed is not like the way the recipe</v>

48
00:01:42.921 --> 00:01:45.890
<v Speaker 1>calls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the recipe calls for you to have a</v>

49
00:01:45.891 --> 00:01:49.850
<v Speaker 1>childhood and try to figure out life and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then become a man and try to find</v>

50
00:01:49.851 --> 00:01:53.580
<v Speaker 1>yourself and then try to find your path.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by the time you be,</v>

51
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.910
<v Speaker 1>he became a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was already famous.</v>

52
00:01:55.911 --> 00:02:00.110
<v Speaker 1>And the same thing with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were already famous as you were</v>

53
00:02:00.111 --> 00:02:01.820
<v Speaker 1>developing and learning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

54
00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:02.763
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

55
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't know exactly how to like kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>even describe it because it's always the</v>

56
00:02:08.451 --> 00:02:12.440
<v Speaker 1>way my life has been kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like in the same way that like a lot of</v>

57
00:02:12.441 --> 00:02:13.101
<v Speaker 1>kids like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

58
00:02:13.101 --> 00:02:17.690
<v Speaker 1>they'd go out and they catch bugs and</v>
<v Speaker 1>play sandlot baseball or whatever.</v>

59
00:02:17.691 --> 00:02:18.501
<v Speaker 1>Like yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just like,</v>

60
00:02:18.501 --> 00:02:20.060
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's the way it is.</v>

61
00:02:20.061 --> 00:02:23.630
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't really realize how unique</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole situation is until you have</v>

62
00:02:23.631 --> 00:02:27.080
<v Speaker 1>perspective cause you have nothing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>compare it to really other than I guess</v>

63
00:02:27.081 --> 00:02:29.330
<v Speaker 1>tv shows and movies and things like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

64
00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.540
<v Speaker 1>So I knew that my upbringing was unique,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

65
00:02:32.541 --> 00:02:36.500
<v Speaker 1>I knew it knew it was different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time it's kind of just,</v>

66
00:02:36.501 --> 00:02:38.870
<v Speaker 1>it's not until you get some perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some life experience,</v>

67
00:02:38.871 --> 00:02:41.060
<v Speaker 1>but until you really realize that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh wait,</v>

68
00:02:41.061 --> 00:02:42.620
<v Speaker 1>this was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was particularly weird.</v>

69
00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.630
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the aspects is</v>

70
00:02:44.631 --> 00:02:48.830
<v Speaker 1>particularly weird about it is a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids that grow up famous,</v>

71
00:02:48.831 --> 00:02:51.520
<v Speaker 1>they grow up on the set.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

72
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.650
<v Speaker 1>And they grow up constantly around</v>
<v Speaker 1>people treat them very differently than</v>

73
00:02:54.651 --> 00:02:56.780
<v Speaker 1>everyone else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just that you're famous,</v>

74
00:02:56.781 --> 00:02:59.620
<v Speaker 1>it's that you're famous and you're also</v>
<v Speaker 1>the complete center attention.</v>

75
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.670
<v Speaker 1>Like you're the reason why we're here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're here to do this television show,</v>

76
00:03:03.671 --> 00:03:05.590
<v Speaker 1>we're here to do this movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're here to do this thing.</v>

77
00:03:05.591 --> 00:03:07.330
<v Speaker 1>You're the star.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>

78
00:03:07.331 --> 00:03:10.300
<v Speaker 1>I think for a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a very strange place to be.</v>

79
00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And especially like,</v>

80
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like when I was a kid,</v>

81
00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:14.860
<v Speaker 1>like me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even before I started working,</v>

82
00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:16.960
<v Speaker 1>I always liked being like the center of</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention kind of thing.</v>

83
00:03:16.961 --> 00:03:18.610
<v Speaker 1>I was definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just,</v>

84
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.680
<v Speaker 1>I was very boisterous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

85
00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.903
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

86
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.970
<v Speaker 1>but in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I'd never really liked being fussed</v>

87
00:03:24.971 --> 00:03:25.960
<v Speaker 1>over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

88
00:03:25.961 --> 00:03:26.830
<v Speaker 1>I didn't like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

89
00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:30.460
<v Speaker 1>like get the hair and makeup costume</v>
<v Speaker 1>people like poking at you all the time</v>

90
00:03:30.461 --> 00:03:32.950
<v Speaker 1>and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That actually wasn't a huge fan after a</v>

91
00:03:32.951 --> 00:03:35.350
<v Speaker 1>while of kind of like being that center</v>
<v Speaker 1>of attention.</v>

92
00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.891
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

93
00:03:35.891 --> 00:03:38.690
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does become a job after a while.</v>

94
00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:39.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

95
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.920
<v Speaker 1>like early on you kind of just do what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do.</v>

96
00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.900
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like I was good at it and boom it</v>

97
00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.010
<v Speaker 1>in the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they do like anything that you're</v>

98
00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.890
<v Speaker 1>like you like it's where the child labor</v>
<v Speaker 1>laws don't apply to acting.</v>

99
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do do that.</v>

100
00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.371
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

101
00:03:52.371 --> 00:03:53.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty well versed in child labor</v>

102
00:03:53.861 --> 00:03:54.591
<v Speaker 1>laws.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

103
00:03:54.591 --> 00:03:55.424
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how's that work then?</v>

104
00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.010
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it goes from state to state.</v>

105
00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.820
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can work you like,</v>

106
00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.840
<v Speaker 1>let's say look in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can work you 10 hours.</v>

107
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it stopped right there.</v>

108
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.880
<v Speaker 1>They can work you like you can't get a</v>
<v Speaker 1>job if that's what you're,</v>

109
00:04:06.881 --> 00:04:08.920
<v Speaker 1>that's what you're kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what their limit is.</v>

110
00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.950
<v Speaker 1>At the same time you have to get three</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours of schooling in plus an hour of</v>

111
00:04:11.951 --> 00:04:13.030
<v Speaker 1>lunch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So really you're only,</v>

112
00:04:13.031 --> 00:04:16.510
<v Speaker 1>you're available window is only six</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours or something like that a day.</v>

113
00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.090
<v Speaker 1>And then like that also in like in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>six hours,</v>

114
00:04:19.091 --> 00:04:21.850
<v Speaker 1>they're always like setting up the</v>
<v Speaker 1>lights for the next shot and you know,</v>

115
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.830
<v Speaker 1>hurry up and wait kind of part of you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

116
00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:25.870
<v Speaker 1>of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I like the second home alone.</v>

117
00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.320
<v Speaker 1>It took like nearly five months to film</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they can only,</v>

118

<v Speaker 1>I'm a classically trained ballerina</v>
<v Speaker 1>right here.</v>

130
00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.800
<v Speaker 1>That Ballerina,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a man,</v>

131
00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:03.520
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

132
00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.530

00:05:11.051 --> 00:05:13.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I can call myself a</v>

135
00:05:13.061 --> 00:05:14.740
<v Speaker 1>ballerina.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I just can't.</v>

136
00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.200
<v Speaker 1>It's too bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's from welcome back Kotter.</v>

137
00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:22.000
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Babbo Reno Fellow Reno.</v>

138
00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.710
<v Speaker 1>So I did that for a number of years and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of kids that do that and</v>

139
00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.170
<v Speaker 1>you get paid and you do the work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

140
00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.400
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are other,</v>

141
00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.670

<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

142
00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:37.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

143
00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.190
<v Speaker 1>That's what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's more than the performing</v>

144
00:05:39.191 --> 00:05:40.470
<v Speaker 1>arts kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't,</v>

145
00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:43.150
<v Speaker 1>you don't see a lot of kids work in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>coal mines anymore.</v>

146
00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:44.650
<v Speaker 1>Like that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

147
00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:45.580
<v Speaker 1>For good reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

148
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:48.970
<v Speaker 1>But some people think that that my six</v>
<v Speaker 1>year old dying of black lung,</v>

149
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.830

<v Speaker 1>there's some horrible pictures from like</v>

150
00:05:53.831 --> 00:05:57.610
<v Speaker 1>the early 19 hundreds of people actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>working in the coal mines when they were</v>

151
00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.150
<v Speaker 1>little tiny kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:00.170
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean there are no newsies anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

154
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:03.290
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

155
00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:06.110
<v Speaker 1>Did you have any say in whether or not</v>
<v Speaker 1>you worked when you were young?</v>

156
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:07.183
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not really.</v>

157
00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:08.620
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

158
00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:10.550
<v Speaker 1>it was after a while it became,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

159
00:06:10.551 --> 00:06:12.050
<v Speaker 1>a job and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

160
00:06:12.051 --> 00:06:14.900
<v Speaker 1>I never chose the projects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>

161
00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:16.370
<v Speaker 1>my parents took,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

162
00:06:16.371 --> 00:06:20.410
<v Speaker 1>essentially like chose them for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there was kind of feel news Mccauley.</v>

163
00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:21.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

164
00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:22.310
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

165
00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:25.560
<v Speaker 1>They called in the class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

166
00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:26.413
<v Speaker 1>there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good on.</v>

167
00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:28.400
<v Speaker 1>And like I never read any of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>scripts.</v>

168
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:31.340
<v Speaker 1>Like I would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would just read the lines for like the</v>

169
00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.290
<v Speaker 1>next day or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I would like get the gist of what</v>

170
00:06:33.291 --> 00:06:36.740
<v Speaker 1>the movie was about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then I just kind of show up and hit</v>

171
00:06:36.741 --> 00:06:37.910
<v Speaker 1>my marks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>find my light,</v>

172
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:38.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

173
00:06:38.841 --> 00:06:39.341
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

174
00:06:39.341 --> 00:06:40.610
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and recite my lines.</v>

175
00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:42.380
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so real.</v>

176
00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:43.700
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

177
00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:45.430
<v Speaker 1>it's what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

178
00:06:45.431 --> 00:06:48.950
<v Speaker 1>it's like in the same way that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like kids go to like school or something</v>

179
00:06:48.951 --> 00:06:49.310
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

180
00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:49.641
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

181
00:06:49.641 --> 00:06:50.090
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

182
00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:52.400
<v Speaker 1>you fall into a routine to a certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>extent,</v>

183
00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:53.510
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

184
00:06:53.511 --> 00:06:55.640
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing about the human mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

185
00:06:55.641 --> 00:07:00.410
<v Speaker 1>So flexible you could adopt to any sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of weird scenario and especially when</v>

186
00:07:00.411 --> 00:07:03.470
<v Speaker 1>you're a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can just bounce,</v>

187
00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:06.560
<v Speaker 1>look on with time adapt so easily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly,</v>

188
00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:08.960
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I always had like a good memory and</v>

189
00:07:08.961 --> 00:07:11.000
<v Speaker 1>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I know I liked,</v>

190
00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:11.943
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

191
00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:17.110
<v Speaker 1>I was big and charismatic and I like had</v>
<v Speaker 1>a good memory like so I could remember</v>

192
00:07:17.391 --> 00:07:19.310
<v Speaker 1>my lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's pretty much what like if</v>

193
00:07:19.311 --> 00:07:19.821
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

194
00:07:19.821 --> 00:07:22.910
<v Speaker 1>like not going to give any advice to any</v>
<v Speaker 1>people about like yeah,</v>

195
00:07:22.911 --> 00:07:24.410
<v Speaker 1>you should put your kid into this line</v>
<v Speaker 1>of work.</v>

196
00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:28.340
<v Speaker 1>But at the same time like what producers</v>
<v Speaker 1>really care about is whether or not you</v>

197
00:07:28.341 --> 00:07:31.430
<v Speaker 1>remember your lines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they like people to get to never</v>

198
00:07:31.431 --> 00:07:34.580
<v Speaker 1>work with kids or animals kind of thing.</v>

199
00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:36.950
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they really,</v>

200
00:07:36.951 --> 00:07:39.230
<v Speaker 1>all they really care about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you remember your lines really liked</v>

201
00:07:39.231 --> 00:07:43.550
<v Speaker 1>because I apparently that's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like for me it never was like if I ever</v>

202
00:07:43.551 --> 00:07:46.040
<v Speaker 1>lost my place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would just see the script in my head</v>

203
00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:47.390
<v Speaker 1>and just read it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

204
00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.640
<v Speaker 1>I kind of had a photographic memory back</v>
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>

205
00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:53.300
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's faded now I'm 37.</v>

206
00:07:53.301 --> 00:07:56.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm about to be 38 in two weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It feels weird,</v>

207
00:07:56.541 --> 00:07:57.380
<v Speaker 1>doesn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

208
00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:57.920
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

209
00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:00.410
<v Speaker 1>Look up my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my bowels are different.</v>

210
00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:03.820
<v Speaker 1>Like</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's different about your bowel?</v>

211
00:08:03.821 --> 00:08:04.350
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

212
00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:04.970
<v Speaker 1>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

213
00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:05.870
<v Speaker 1>I like she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just got,</v>

214
00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:06.713
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

215
00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:09.020
<v Speaker 1>doing some like random checkup kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and they're like,</v>

216
00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:10.100
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should scope you.</v>

217
00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:11.450
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they also,</v>

218
00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:12.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

219
00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:13.720
<v Speaker 1>I did the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the scoping like,</v>

220
00:08:13.721 --> 00:08:15.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my stomach kind of thing,</v>

221
00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:16.270
<v Speaker 1>but they also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

222
00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:19.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a colonoscopy so I was actually</v>

223
00:08:19.341 --> 00:08:21.000
<v Speaker 1>hoping like he's there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put me under,</v>

224
00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:22.610
<v Speaker 1>so I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it didn't really matter to me,</v>

225
00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:24.890
<v Speaker 1>but I was to put you under for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>colonoscopy.</v>

226
00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:25.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

227
00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:27.560
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least I had that and a scoping.</v>

228
00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:28.550
<v Speaker 1>So I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

229
00:08:28.551 --> 00:08:29.630
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's down the throat.</v>

230
00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:31.760
<v Speaker 1>I was hoping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was actually hoping they were going</v>

231
00:08:31.761 --> 00:08:32.594
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

232
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:34.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>use the butland first and then put it in</v>

233
00:08:34.761 --> 00:08:39.761
<v Speaker 1>my mouth and just asked to mouth boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>

234
00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:41.870
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently they use different cameras.</v>

235
00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:44.150
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably designed different,</v>

236
00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:45.530
<v Speaker 1>you don't go as deep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

237
00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:47.720
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause they were like all worried I might</v>

<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

240
00:08:51.051 --> 00:08:53.090
<v Speaker 1>something kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been a little iffy.</v>

241
00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:54.800
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the good news,</v>

242
00:08:54.801 --> 00:08:57.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't an ulcer bad news is I have two</v>
<v Speaker 1>ulcers.</v>

243
00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:00.000
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm dealing with that.</v>

244
00:09:00.001 --> 00:09:02.400
<v Speaker 1>I've had to like curtail my lifestyle in</v>
<v Speaker 1>general.</v>

245
00:09:02.401 --> 00:09:04.790
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm eating less red meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

246
00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:07.830
<v Speaker 1>less carbonated beverages like</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ibuprofen,</v>

247
00:09:07.831 --> 00:09:08.790
<v Speaker 1>no more Ibuprofen.</v>

248
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:10.830
<v Speaker 1>Like the honest stove.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's terrible for your gut.</v>

249
00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:11.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

250
00:09:11.911 --> 00:09:13.320
<v Speaker 1>So like I've had to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

251
00:09:13.321 --> 00:09:17.100
<v Speaker 1>I used to like eat like burgers every</v>
<v Speaker 1>single day and now it's like I can have</v>

252
00:09:17.101 --> 00:09:19.630
<v Speaker 1>two servings of red meat a week kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

253
00:09:19.631 --> 00:09:21.810
<v Speaker 1>And it wasn't too hard for me to curtail</v>
<v Speaker 1>my lifestyle.</v>

254
00:09:21.811 --> 00:09:23.790
<v Speaker 1>Look at smoking less,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to drink less,</v>

255
00:09:23.791 --> 00:09:27.840
<v Speaker 1>like things like that young guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the logic behind red meat?</v>

256
00:09:27.841 --> 00:09:29.050
<v Speaker 1>Less I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

257
00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:30.420
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

258
00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:33.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm not at the doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does the doctor have a method to his</v>

259
00:09:33.631 --> 00:09:34.201
<v Speaker 1>madness?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

260
00:09:34.201 --> 00:09:36.180
<v Speaker 1>just yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you read the list of like,</v>

261
00:09:36.181 --> 00:09:37.830
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that are good or bad for your</v>

262
00:09:37.831 --> 00:09:39.830
<v Speaker 1>ulcer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So things that aggravate it.</v>

263
00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:42.150
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So red meat like falls into that</v>

264
00:09:42.151 --> 00:09:44.400
<v Speaker 1>category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was funny microphone but chicken</v>

265
00:09:44.401 --> 00:09:47.100
<v Speaker 1>doesn't fish doesn't apparently not or</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least you know,</v>

266
00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:48.540
<v Speaker 1>less so weird.</v>

267
00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:49.770
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah my,</v>

268
00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.350
<v Speaker 1>cause my special lady friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was like,</v>

269
00:09:51.351 --> 00:09:52.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>worried about me and stuff.</v>

270
00:09:52.771 --> 00:09:54.450
<v Speaker 1>So she was reading up on like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

271
00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:57.780
<v Speaker 1>ulcers and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was like the first,</v>

272
00:09:57.781 --> 00:09:59.820
<v Speaker 1>like there was like seven things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

273
00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:04.740
<v Speaker 1>that flare it up at all of them were</v>
<v Speaker 1>like check marks for exactly what I was</v>

274
00:10:04.741 --> 00:10:06.120
<v Speaker 1>doing in my life kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

275
00:10:06.121 --> 00:10:08.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like I said red meats,</v>

276
00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:09.960
<v Speaker 1>smoking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drinking,</v>

277
00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:13.620
<v Speaker 1>like I had just had like a neck issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was taking a lot of Ibuprofen and</v>

278
00:10:13.621 --> 00:10:15.870
<v Speaker 1>it was just like every single check</v>
<v Speaker 1>mark,</v>

279
00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:16.710
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

280
00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:18.570
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've read something about Ibuprofen</v>

281
00:10:18.571 --> 00:10:22.260
<v Speaker 1>doing it because Ibuprofen disrupts gut</v>
<v Speaker 1>bacteria and they believe that gut</v>

282
00:10:22.261 --> 00:10:24.420
<v Speaker 1>bacteria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was there was something really</v>

283
00:10:24.421 --> 00:10:26.970
<v Speaker 1>recent about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a real recent study.</v>

284
00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:30.510
<v Speaker 1>They think that they found a new cause</v>
<v Speaker 1>for ulcers.</v>

285
00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:33.960
<v Speaker 1>Like they've changed what they feed</v>
<v Speaker 1>these to think it was caused by stress,</v>

286
00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:37.020
<v Speaker 1>which can do it like also like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I just started again.</v>

287
00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:40.200
<v Speaker 1>I have also had like I've just started a</v>
<v Speaker 1>new company and things like that.</v>

288
00:10:40.201 --> 00:10:42.360
<v Speaker 1>So like I have that kind of stress like</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of thing.</v>

289
00:10:42.361 --> 00:10:42.691
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

290
00:10:42.691 --> 00:10:43.261
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

291
00:10:43.261 --> 00:10:45.210
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hit a lot of the checkmarks look at</v>

292
00:10:45.211 --> 00:10:48.270
<v Speaker 1>when you say can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what they were saying was they</v>

293
00:10:48.271 --> 00:10:51.960
<v Speaker 1>used to think it can do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now they think it's all a matter of</v>

294
00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:54.270
<v Speaker 1>a bacteria in your stomach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

295
00:10:54.271 --> 00:10:57.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think that's a big part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also if you like,</v>

296
00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:00.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I did a movie in Thailand,</v>

297
00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:01.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like last year and uh,</v>

298
00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:02.940
<v Speaker 1>came back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

299
00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:06.690
<v Speaker 1>came back with a worm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what are those like single cell kind</v>

300
00:11:06.691 --> 00:11:07.540
<v Speaker 1>of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

301
00:11:07.541 --> 00:11:08.730
<v Speaker 1>I was getting the medication for it.</v>

302
00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:09.563
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what do I,</v>

303
00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:11.400
<v Speaker 1>what should I expect from this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

304
00:11:11.401 --> 00:11:13.710
<v Speaker 1>what do you expect you to get better?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>

305
00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:14.041
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

306
00:11:14.041 --> 00:11:15.260
<v Speaker 1>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what's like,</v>

307
00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:18.100
<v Speaker 1>am I going to shit a worm?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Am I going to shoot out of it?</v>

308
00:11:18.101 --> 00:11:18.671
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

309
00:11:18.671 --> 00:11:19.504
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

310
00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:21.450
<v Speaker 1>this is one of those single cell ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

311
00:11:21.451 --> 00:11:23.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it made me more susceptible to like</v>

312
00:11:23.941 --> 00:11:25.220
<v Speaker 1>getting ulcers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

313
00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:28.760
<v Speaker 1>So is this because of the antibiotics</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you had to take for the worm or I</v>

314
00:11:28.761 --> 00:11:30.470
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it just,</v>

315
00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:35.520
<v Speaker 1>it messes with your stomach chemistry</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of thing after that is when you got</v>

316
00:11:35.521 --> 00:11:36.150
<v Speaker 1>the ulcer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

317
00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:37.620
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

318
00:11:37.621 --> 00:11:38.210
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

319
00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:40.020
<v Speaker 1>soon dealing with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's actually,</v>

320
00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:41.430
<v Speaker 1>it's actually not so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

544
00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:24.630
<v Speaker 1>so I was back in the states and it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

545

<v Speaker 1>I remember waking up one of those days</v>

551
00:18:35.881 --> 00:18:37.760
<v Speaker 1>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure I have a worm looking to</v>

552
00:18:37.761 --> 00:18:38.760
<v Speaker 1>actually just popped in my head.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

554
00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:43.350

<v Speaker 1>It was almost kind of a mano s kind of</v>

555
00:18:43.351 --> 00:18:45.870

00:19:45.331 --> 00:19:47.010
<v Speaker 1>sleep in the bed together and stuff like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

591
00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:48.700
<v Speaker 1>Like Zur Bert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

592
00:19:48.701 --> 00:19:49.490
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

593
00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:53.340
<v Speaker 1>you should be tested for toxo plasma</v>
<v Speaker 1>toxoplasmosis.</v>

594
00:19:53.341 --> 00:19:56.230
<v Speaker 1>I've actually had that before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you have it then yeah,</v>

595
00:19:56.231 --> 00:19:57.240
<v Speaker 1>you have it for life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

596
00:19:57.241 --> 00:19:57.991
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

597
00:19:57.991 --> 00:20:00.150
<v Speaker 1>I went through the symptoms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I caught it from an under cooked piece</v>

598
00:20:00.151 --> 00:20:01.320
<v Speaker 1>of lamb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually.</v>

599
00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:04.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the four ways you can get it</v>

600
00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:05.230
<v Speaker 1>kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

601
00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:06.061
<v Speaker 1>no kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

602
00:20:06.061 --> 00:20:07.800
<v Speaker 1>you can get it from a yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from cats.</v>

603
00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:11.520
<v Speaker 1>You can get it from under cook lamb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get it through a blood</v>

604
00:20:11.521 --> 00:20:14.340
<v Speaker 1>transfusion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the other one is a mother</v>

605
00:20:14.341 --> 00:20:16.770
<v Speaker 1>can transfer it to its B to their baby.</v>

606
00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:18.323
<v Speaker 1>We're looking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe me,</v>

607
00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:21.330
<v Speaker 1>I went to the whole CDC website and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything like uh,</v>

608
00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:23.700
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that was like mono kind of thing.</v>

609
00:20:23.701 --> 00:20:26.850
<v Speaker 1>Like a lot of people catch it but they</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they just have the antibodies for</v>

610
00:20:26.851 --> 00:20:28.530
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was a little rundown.</v>

611
00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:32.400
<v Speaker 1>I was doing a play in London for like 10</v>
<v Speaker 1>months and also that kind of going out</v>

612
00:20:32.401 --> 00:20:34.980
<v Speaker 1>at night and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think my body was kind of just like</v>

613
00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:37.770
<v Speaker 1>not it's strongest and boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it hit me like a ton of bricks.</v>

614
00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:40.950
<v Speaker 1>Like it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like mono kind of thing and I was</v>

615
00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:43.040
<v Speaker 1>totally run down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

616
00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:47.160
<v Speaker 1>I got better after about like three</v>
<v Speaker 1>months or so,</v>

617
00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:48.400
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't get a hundred percent</v>

618
00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:51.010
<v Speaker 2>better for about a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a crazy article just written</v>

619
00:20:51.011 --> 00:20:55.660
<v Speaker 2>about toxo that it had some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>impact on people who are,</v>

620
00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:59.100
<v Speaker 2>who startup businesses that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>entrepreneur,</v>

621
00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:04.180
<v Speaker 2>more entrepreneurs have toxoplasmosis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a radically affects behavior</v>

622
00:21:04.451 --> 00:21:05.610
<v Speaker 2>apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

623
00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:06.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

624
00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:08.830
<v Speaker 2>I got it when I was like 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm going to ask.</v>

625
00:21:08.831 --> 00:21:11.800
<v Speaker 2>So it makes you more risk taking more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more.</v>

626
00:21:11.801 --> 00:21:13.410
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes you more than hair.</v>

627
00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:15.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Parasite founding cat poo has been</v>

628
00:21:15.191 --> 00:21:19.090
<v Speaker 2>linked to higher likelihood of</v>
<v Speaker 2>entrepreneurial behavior in people who</v>

629
00:21:19.091 --> 00:21:20.680
<v Speaker 2>get infected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

630
00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:22.163
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

631
00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:25.280
<v Speaker 2>I just launched my own website recently</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they,</v>

632
00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:26.140
<v Speaker 2>that kind of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

633
00:21:26.141 --> 00:21:26.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they go,</v>

634
00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:31.840
<v Speaker 2>I blame the toxoplasmosis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you read up on it a lot?</v>

635
00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:35.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any of Robert Sapolsky stuff?</v>

636
00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:36.430
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

637
00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:37.290
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not in a while.</v>

638
00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:37.721
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

639
00:21:37.721 --> 00:21:38.051
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

640
00:21:38.051 --> 00:21:41.410
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got this like in like 2000 2001 Paul</v>

641
00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:41.410
<v Speaker 2>Skis.</v>

642
00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:44.020
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a professor at Stanford and a,</v>

643
00:21:44.021 --> 00:21:48.550
<v Speaker 2>he's a biologist and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he specializes in toxoplasmosis and</v>

644
00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:51.100
<v Speaker 2>primate behavior and a lot of of his</v>
<v Speaker 2>biologist.</v>

645
00:21:51.101 --> 00:21:53.770
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is a discipline.</v>

646
00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:55.151
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

647
00:21:55.151 --> 00:21:57.970
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got some amazing talks on it.</v>

648
00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.670
<v Speaker 2>You really should listen to it since you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have it.</v>

649
00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:02.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fascinating stuff.</v>

650
00:22:02.411 --> 00:22:05.050
<v Speaker 2>They found a disproportionate number of</v>
<v Speaker 2>motorcycle victims,</v>

651
00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:09.140
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>motorcycle crashes taking you were</v>

652
00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:10.030
<v Speaker 2>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

653
00:22:10.090 --> 00:22:10.720
<v Speaker 2>That's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

654
00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:11.890
<v Speaker 2>that's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

655
00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:13.180
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know how it works.</v>

656
00:22:13.181 --> 00:22:18.181
<v Speaker 2>So it only,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can only reproduce inside the cat's</v>

657
00:22:18.281 --> 00:22:22.990
<v Speaker 2>gut and it rewires the sexual reward</v>
<v Speaker 2>system of a rat.</v>

658
00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:26.650
<v Speaker 2>So it makes a rat horny when it smells</v>
<v Speaker 2>cat piss.</v>

659
00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:30.550
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it completely changes the cats sexual</v>

660
00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:32.030
<v Speaker 2>reward system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

661
00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:33.093
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes sense.</v>

662
00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:34.510
<v Speaker 2>Excuse me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

663
00:22:34.511 --> 00:22:34.841
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

664
00:22:34.841 --> 00:22:35.400
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

665
00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:37.350
<v Speaker 2>like evolutionary advantage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

666
00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:40.450
<v Speaker 2>of pending to habit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary advantage.</v>

667
00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:41.111
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

668
00:22:41.111 --> 00:22:46.111
<v Speaker 2>it actually tricks the cat into killing</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rap and tricks the rat into being</v>

669
00:22:46.151 --> 00:22:48.130
<v Speaker 2>horny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They tend to come around.</v>

670
00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:48.761
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

671
00:22:48.761 --> 00:22:50.560
<v Speaker 2>That's what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an evolutionary advantage to</v>

672
00:22:50.561 --> 00:22:51.670
<v Speaker 2>them because like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

673
00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:53.260
<v Speaker 2>like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're a cat and you have</v>

674
00:22:53.261 --> 00:22:55.450
<v Speaker 2>toxoplasmosis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's going to,</v>

675
00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:56.350
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

676
00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:58.420
<v Speaker 2>it's going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to attract your pray to you.</v>

677
00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:00.160
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it actually doesn't know.</v>

678
00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:01.540
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't work that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

679
00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:03.580
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rat has to be infected.</v>

680
00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:07.090
<v Speaker 2>When the rats infected,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it smells cat urine and it gets</v>

681
00:23:07.091 --> 00:23:08.750
<v Speaker 2>horny when the cats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>

682
00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:11.770
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't do anything to the cat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems to have no change in the</v>

683
00:23:11.771 --> 00:23:13.870
<v Speaker 2>behavior of the cabinets and it gets to</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

684
00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:16.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it only affects really the behavior</v>

685
00:23:16.571 --> 00:23:17.950
<v Speaker 2>of people and rats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

686
00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:19.220
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

687
00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:20.560
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

688
00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:21.610
<v Speaker 2>I caught it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got the,</v>

689
00:23:21.611 --> 00:23:23.590
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got the antibodies for it or whatever.</v>

690
00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:25.390
<v Speaker 2>It's one of those like forever kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

691
00:23:25.391 --> 00:23:27.970
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't affect me like at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

692
00:23:27.971 --> 00:23:29.770
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no hell urgent issue.</v>

693
00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:31.043
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>health issue.</v>

694
00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:31.511
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I mean.</v>

695
00:23:31.511 --> 00:23:31.751
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

696
00:23:31.751 --> 00:23:32.441
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a,</v>

697
00:23:32.441 --> 00:23:33.161
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

698
00:23:33.161 --> 00:23:34.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was one of those things where like,</v>

699
00:23:34.541 --> 00:23:36.820
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got sick for a couple of months and</v>

700
00:23:36.821 --> 00:23:37.654
<v Speaker 2>then boom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

701
00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:38.680
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like Mano,</v>

702
00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:41.530
<v Speaker 2>I think it was just tired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Disproportionate number of successful</v>

703
00:23:41.531 --> 00:23:46.010
<v Speaker 2>soccer teams that come from countries</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are of high rates of toxoplasma</v>

704
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:47.480
<v Speaker 1>infection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should get into soccer.</v>

705
00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:49.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just one of those things.</v>

706
00:23:49.191 --> 00:23:49.960
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

707
00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:52.820
<v Speaker 1>it changes the way people behave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make some,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I can tell him interesting life you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you,</v>

947
00:31:08.381 --> 00:31:10.240
<v Speaker 1>so you just kind of do whatever you</v>
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>

948

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My friend Genx is,</v>

949
00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:13.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm a man of leisure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the way he described.</v>

950
00:31:13.541 --> 00:31:16.480
<v Speaker 1>It's like my life and lifestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good way to describe it.</v>

951
00:31:16.570 --> 00:31:17.351
<v Speaker 1>And it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And look,</v>

952
00:31:17.351 --> 00:31:20.380
<v Speaker 1>I kind of looked at him kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to spend some time just like</v>

953
00:31:20.410 --> 00:31:22.350
<v Speaker 1>jumping around like Europe or something</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

954
00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:22.811
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

955
00:31:22.811 --> 00:31:25.030
<v Speaker 1>and just like where you lived in Paris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who were saying,</v>

956
00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:28.000
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lived there for a number of years.</v>

957
00:31:28.001 --> 00:31:28.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still have,</v>

958
00:31:28.690 --> 00:31:30.070
<v Speaker 1>I still have my place there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

959
00:31:30.071 --> 00:31:33.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since like 2013 so many things,</v>

960
00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:35.590
<v Speaker 1>it's only in the last year I've been</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of spending more time in the</v>

961
00:31:35.591 --> 00:31:37.900
<v Speaker 1>states.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it that brought you to Paris?</v>

962
00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:39.010
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the food sucks.</v>

963
00:31:39.011 --> 00:31:40.780
<v Speaker 1>The wines terrible and the women are</v>
<v Speaker 1>ugly.</v>

964
00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:43.990
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but otherwise it's fantastic.</v>

965
00:31:43.991 --> 00:31:46.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

966
00:31:46.571 --> 00:31:48.880
<v Speaker 1>it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was an agreeable lifestyle.</v>

967
00:31:48.930 --> 00:31:51.430
<v Speaker 1>I did a bunch of friends out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were always asking me,</v>

968
00:31:52.270 --> 00:31:54.040
<v Speaker 1>what are you gonna move to Paris and</v>
<v Speaker 1>winning to learn French.</v>

969
00:31:54.090 --> 00:31:56.650
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the or your friends in Paris.</v>

970
00:31:57.320 --> 00:32:00.790
<v Speaker 1>And I was there just kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just kind of jumping around a</v>

971
00:32:00.791 --> 00:32:01.870
<v Speaker 1>little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

972
00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:04.600
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought about it for a second and I</v>

973
00:32:04.601 --> 00:32:05.434
<v Speaker 1>went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

974
00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:06.333
<v Speaker 1>how's next week?</v>

975
00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:09.880
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to leave my bags here,</v>

976
00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:11.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to fly back to New York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to going,</v>

977
00:32:11.921 --> 00:32:14.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll put my affairs in order.</v>

978
00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:16.180
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be back next week.</v>

979
00:32:16.250 --> 00:32:16.741
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

982
00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:22.660
<v Speaker 1>I realized that if I could pick up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>just move to France on a whim,</v>

983
00:32:23.130 --> 00:32:24.940
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it wouldn't affect like,</v>

984
00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:26.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like anyone's life or it wouldn't hurt</v>

985
00:32:26.741 --> 00:32:30.040
<v Speaker 1>anybody or think I'd be remiss if I</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't look,</v>

986
00:32:30.041 --> 00:32:30.551
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

1126
00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:47.850
<v Speaker 1>I for some reason it reminds me of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was an old onion article and it's one</v>

<v Speaker 2>Like I guess she has to maintain it and</v>

1180
00:38:47.501 --> 00:38:49.810
<v Speaker 2>you know that lifestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's what he wants for himself.</v>

1181
00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:51.880
<v Speaker 2>That's what he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's his life.</v>

1182
00:38:51.910 --> 00:38:54.500
<v Speaker 2>His life is spending all that money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1183
00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:57.640
<v Speaker 2>Like his whole life is doing movie that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1184
00:38:58.150 --> 00:39:02.470
<v Speaker 2>people though also when they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're involved in laborious projects</v>

1185
00:39:02.471 --> 00:39:04.750
<v Speaker 2>that they're not really interested in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1186
00:39:05.230 --> 00:39:07.120
<v Speaker 2>when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're doing something all day,</v>

1187
00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:09.490
<v Speaker 2>and I say this is a guy who hosted fear</v>
<v Speaker 2>factor</v>

1188
00:39:11.890 --> 00:39:15.640
<v Speaker 2>that you don't really enjoy doing while</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing it,</v>

1189
00:39:15.641 --> 00:39:16.810
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1190
00:39:16.930 --> 00:39:19.180
<v Speaker 2>time to go to work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was very thankful to have the</v>

1191
00:39:19.181 --> 00:39:19.630
<v Speaker 2>job.</v>

1192
00:39:19.630 --> 00:39:22.270
<v Speaker 2>Don't get me wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the reality is it was not enjoy.</v>

1193
00:39:22.350 --> 00:39:26.890
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't a fruitful endeavor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't like working for the UFC are</v>

1194
00:39:26.891 --> 00:39:28.970
<v Speaker 2>doing standup comedy or even doing a</v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast.</v>

1195
00:39:28.990 --> 00:39:30.790
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't a passion project.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1196
00:39:30.791 --> 00:39:34.810
<v Speaker 2>So when you do something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like people on bad sitcoms in</v>

1197
00:39:34.811 --> 00:39:37.030
<v Speaker 2>particular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they spend all their fucking money.</v>

1198
00:39:37.031 --> 00:39:37.864
<v Speaker 2>They go crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1199
00:39:37.970 --> 00:39:41.080
<v Speaker 2>Because the only thing that they look</v>
<v Speaker 2>forward to is what am I going to do with</v>

1200
00:39:41.081 --> 00:39:43.380
<v Speaker 2>this money?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're to buy a Ferrari,</v>

1201
00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:45.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to buy a mansion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to buy an island.</v>

1202
00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:48.370
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what Johnny got into.</v>

1203
00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:49.273
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1204
00:39:49.410 --> 00:39:53.710
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't see myself like doing a</v>
<v Speaker 2>sitcom or a television show kind of</v>

1205
00:39:53.711 --> 00:39:54.700
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what about a good,</v>

1206
00:39:55.020 --> 00:39:57.490
<v Speaker 2>a good one?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do like news radio's a fantastic show</v>

1207
00:39:57.491 --> 00:40:00.070
<v Speaker 2>look like you must have been that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That must have been like a fruitful</v>

1208
00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:00.700
<v Speaker 2>endeavor.</v>

1209
00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:02.400
<v Speaker 2>Reason why I never did another one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1210
00:40:02.490 --> 00:40:03.970
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to ruin that experience.</v>

1211
00:40:03.971 --> 00:40:05.590
<v Speaker 2>Every other one that came along was</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1212
00:40:05.591 --> 00:40:06.820
<v Speaker 2>this is shit go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>

1214
00:40:08.410 --> 00:40:10.960
<v Speaker 2>for a big bang theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Christ,</v>

1215
00:40:10.990 --> 00:40:12.790
<v Speaker 2>you got lucky and didn't get that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

1216
00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:13.750
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said like,</v>

1217
00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:15.520
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause it was kind of like the way that</v>

1218
00:40:15.521 --> 00:40:16.540
<v Speaker 2>pitch was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was kind of just like,</v>

1219
00:40:16.541 --> 00:40:18.740
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these two like astrophysicist nerds and</v>

1220
00:40:18.741 --> 00:40:21.910
<v Speaker 2>then a pretty girl lives with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He links like,</v>

1221
00:40:21.911 --> 00:40:25.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and like that was the pitch and it was</v>

1222
00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:26.590
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1223
00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:27.521
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1224
00:40:27.521 --> 00:40:29.020
<v Speaker 2>we're going to get some real like</v>
<v Speaker 2>physicists to like,</v>

1225
00:40:29.050 --> 00:40:29.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do the math.</v>

1226
00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:30.641
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1227
00:40:30.641 --> 00:40:31.600
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1228
00:40:31.601 --> 00:40:34.480
<v Speaker 2>Like thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they came back at me again and</v>

1229
00:40:34.481 --> 00:40:34.991
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1230
00:40:34.991 --> 00:40:35.390
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look.</v>

<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1233
00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:41.130
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they came back at me again and then</v>

1234
00:40:41.131 --> 00:40:43.610
<v Speaker 2>like even my manager,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like twisting my arm and I like,</v>

1235
00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:47.680
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd have hundreds of millions of dollars</v>

1236
00:40:47.681 --> 00:40:49.600
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like if I did that Gig at the</v>

1237
00:40:49.601 --> 00:40:51.700
<v Speaker 2>same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be bashing my head against the wall.</v>

1238
00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:52.870
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1239
00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:55.870
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what Johnny Depp's doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we can't really be into those pirate</v>

1240
00:40:55.871 --> 00:40:56.561
<v Speaker 2>movies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1242
00:40:57.071 --> 00:40:58.600
<v Speaker 2>he's interested.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the thing is that like,</v>

1243
00:40:58.601 --> 00:41:01.750
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't always like that all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like all about the money.</v>

1244
00:41:01.830 --> 00:41:02.621
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a thing,</v>

1245
00:41:02.621 --> 00:41:05.410
<v Speaker 2>I read an article,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an interview with him,</v>

1246
00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:08.470
<v Speaker 2>it was about two decades ago and he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about,</v>

1247
00:41:08.490 --> 00:41:09.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was in his thirties,</v>

1248
00:41:09.581 --> 00:41:11.860
<v Speaker 2>and he was doing a lot of weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obscure movies.</v>

<v Speaker 2>which is what he said.</v>

1254

<v Speaker 1>colorization of movies and talking about</v>

1266
00:41:44.091 --> 00:41:48.230
<v Speaker 1>how movies are or are part of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>heritage and you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

1268
00:41:50.391 --> 00:41:55.391
<v Speaker 1>He goes back 25 years later he's going</v>
<v Speaker 1>back and redoing his movies and it's</v>

1269
00:41:55.551 --> 00:41:55.821
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Look at a look at it.</v>

1297
00:43:02.541 --> 00:43:07.130
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is talking about that theory that</v>

1298
00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:09.530
<v Speaker 1>some people believe that Leonardo</v>
<v Speaker 1>Davinci,</v>

1299
00:43:09.950 --> 00:43:12.200
<v Speaker 1>that Mona Lisa was him in drag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1300
00:43:12.201 --> 00:43:14.180
<v Speaker 1>That it was a self portrait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who has it?</v>

1301
00:43:14.650 --> 00:43:17.510
<v Speaker 1>That when I was bringing up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kalin said that the other day.</v>

1302
00:43:17.620 --> 00:43:18.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen,</v>

1303
00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:21.380
<v Speaker 1>I've seen those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does it pull up a picture of him</v>

1304
00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:23.660
<v Speaker 1>with this and what we never did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We only pulled up a picture of the</v>

1305
00:43:23.661 --> 00:43:25.820
<v Speaker 1>photo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We never pulled up a picture of him and</v>

1306
00:43:25.821 --> 00:43:27.530
<v Speaker 1>the photo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if that's,</v>

1307
00:43:27.531 --> 00:43:29.270
<v Speaker 1>that's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that really was the case.</v>

1308
00:43:29.271 --> 00:43:32.150
<v Speaker 1>If he just decided to paint himself and</v>
<v Speaker 1>drag.</v>

1309
00:43:32.151 --> 00:43:33.560
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they found all kinds of things in that</v>

1310
00:43:33.561 --> 00:43:35.130
<v Speaker 1>painting.</v>

<v Speaker 1>like letters in there and stuff like</v>

1313
00:43:41.330 --> 00:43:42.290
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really tiny,</v>

1314
00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:46.340
<v Speaker 1>like straight Illuminati.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Demon comes right out of the ground.</v>

1315
00:43:46.730 --> 00:43:48.710

<v Speaker 1>he was an artist.</v>

1410
00:47:38.501 --> 00:47:40.740
<v Speaker 1>He was very aware that he was Picasso</v>
<v Speaker 1>lucky.</v>

1411

<v Speaker 1>He was already like the most famous</v>

1413
00:47:43.121 --> 00:47:45.370
<v Speaker 1>painter in the world and he knew it kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of thing.</v>

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1415
00:47:46.270 --> 00:47:49.120

<v Speaker 1>he didn't carry money or a wallet.</v>

1416
00:47:49.150 --> 00:47:51.160
<v Speaker 1>He just carried like a pad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if he wanted to get like a,</v>

1425
00:48:06.190 --> 00:48:08.230

<v Speaker 1>sketches,</v>

1427
00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:11.620
<v Speaker 1>like all around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're actually quite affordable,</v>

1428
00:48:11.621 --> 00:48:14.940
<v Speaker 1>at least in terms of owning the Picasso,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the keys,</v>

1429
00:48:14.950 --> 00:48:17.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was very prolific and just like a lot</v>

1430
00:48:17.751 --> 00:48:21.190
<v Speaker 1>of like ink drawings and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember there was the snl sketch,</v>

00:48:22.510 --> 00:48:25.360
<v Speaker 1>It's was playing Picasso and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like he kind of,</v>

1433
00:48:25.361 --> 00:48:28.180
<v Speaker 1>I think it went around kind of just</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing anything he wanted and he's like,</v>

1434
00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:30.340
<v Speaker 1>it's because I'm Picasso,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1435
00:48:30.341 --> 00:48:31.091
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was just like,</v>

1436
00:48:31.091 --> 00:48:34.000
<v Speaker 1>just being in church.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody you mentioned love.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1446
00:48:47.531 --> 00:48:49.810
<v Speaker 1>I've always like every time I bumped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bumped into him.</v>

1447
00:48:50.370 --> 00:48:51.580
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very nice person.</v>

00:48:51.581 --> 00:48:52.540
<v Speaker 1>That really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really sweet.</v>

1449
00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:53.860
<v Speaker 1>I ran into him at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1450
00:48:53.950 --> 00:48:55.540
<v Speaker 1>I went to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1451
00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:59.080
<v Speaker 1>with my buddy seth green.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We went to the peewee Herman a Broadway</v>

1452
00:48:59.081 --> 00:49:02.200
<v Speaker 1>show that they had a bunch of years back</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet I ran into love.</v>

1453
00:49:02.201 --> 00:49:03.760
<v Speaker 1>It's like they're backstage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's like,</v>

1454
00:49:03.761 --> 00:49:04.990
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like me,</v>

1455
00:49:04.991 --> 00:49:06.880
<v Speaker 1>Seth Greene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>peewee Herman and Jon Lovitz.</v>

1456
00:49:06.881 --> 00:49:07.900
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is quite a,</v>

1457
00:49:08.380 --> 00:49:10.200
<v Speaker 1>quite a little little get together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

1458
00:49:10.220 --> 00:49:12.070
<v Speaker 1>this is great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a great table.</v>

1459
00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:15.790
<v Speaker 1>I was doing standup for a while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he's doing any more</v>

1460
00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:17.020
<v Speaker 1>because I don't see him anymore.</v>

1461
00:49:17.260 --> 00:49:20.410
<v Speaker 1>But a few years back he was doing a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of standup,</v>

1462
00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:22.380
<v Speaker 1>like he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he bought,</v>

1463
00:49:23.710 --> 00:49:28.210
<v Speaker 1>he bought the Jon Lovitz Comedy Club.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And universal universal is the worst</v>

1464
00:49:28.270 --> 00:49:30.490
<v Speaker 1>comedy club design of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1465
00:49:30.491 --> 00:49:31.324
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1466
00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:34.240
<v Speaker 1>it's weird that he was actually able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>find a club that was already named after</v>

1467
00:49:34.241 --> 00:49:35.310
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wouldn't,</v>

1468
00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:36.131
<v Speaker 1>what are the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the odds?</v>

1469
00:49:36.131 --> 00:49:38.530
<v Speaker 1>He bought a place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It used to be the house of Blues.</v>

1470
00:49:38.531 --> 00:49:39.221
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1471
00:49:39.221 --> 00:49:42.040
<v Speaker 1>it was bb King's club.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was bb King's Blues Club.</v>

1472
00:49:42.220 --> 00:49:44.590
<v Speaker 1>And he turns it into the John Lovitz</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1473
00:49:44.950 --> 00:49:47.560
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

1474
00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:49.720
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really interesting.</v>

1475
00:49:49.721 --> 00:49:54.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm remembering that I saw Sean Penn had</v>
<v Speaker 1>that older brother,</v>

1476
00:49:54.491 --> 00:49:58.900
<v Speaker 1>that big brother that died crispin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw that guy there,</v>

1477
00:49:59.260 --> 00:50:04.120
<v Speaker 1>play the harmonica,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hammered one onstage and play the</v>

1478
00:50:04.121 --> 00:50:05.890
<v Speaker 1>harmonica and hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Chris Ben.</v>

1479
00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:07.990
<v Speaker 1>That was some weird Hollywood thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

1480
00:50:07.991 --> 00:50:09.760
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine that you're so famous.</v>

1481
00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:13.600
<v Speaker 1>You just jump on stage at a blues club</v>
<v Speaker 1>and play the harmonica and everybody's</v>

1482
00:50:13.601 --> 00:50:14.570
<v Speaker 1>happier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

1483
00:50:14.610 --> 00:50:15.250
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird.</v>

1484
00:50:15.250 --> 00:50:16.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

1485
00:50:16.570 --> 00:50:19.120
<v Speaker 1>I was hoping it was gonna be like Sean</v>
<v Speaker 1>Penn jumped up there and did like his</v>

1486
00:50:19.121 --> 00:50:20.550
<v Speaker 1>tight five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you would be on,</v>

1487
00:50:21.250 --> 00:50:23.950
<v Speaker 1>that would be strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Mayer does stand up.</v>

1488
00:50:23.980 --> 00:50:25.750
<v Speaker 1>I've heard that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very strange.</v>

1489
00:50:25.980 --> 00:50:28.220
<v Speaker 1>So if you're on stage bb King's</v>

1490
00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:29.690
<v Speaker 2>place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if this was a stage,</v>

1491
00:50:29.930 --> 00:50:33.440
<v Speaker 2>there would be a balcony,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it would be above you like way up</v>

1492
00:50:33.441 --> 00:50:36.590
<v Speaker 2>there right above you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so like you'd have to look up to see</v>

1493
00:50:36.591 --> 00:50:38.450
<v Speaker 2>the people that are white.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're basically looking straight</v>

1494
00:50:38.451 --> 00:50:42.010
<v Speaker 2>down on the top of your head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Worst idea for design,</v>

1495
00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:46.160
<v Speaker 2>but it's not as serious when you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing music,</v>

1496
00:50:46.190 --> 00:50:48.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't necessarily have to be as</v>

1497
00:50:48.711 --> 00:50:50.600
<v Speaker 2>connected to the person's face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been to,</v>

1498
00:50:50.601 --> 00:50:54.410
<v Speaker 2>I've been to a place where actually like</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were literally right over the band</v>

1499
00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:55.730
<v Speaker 2>and that was kind of neat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like actually watching,</v>

1500
00:50:55.740 --> 00:50:57.440
<v Speaker 2>watching the drummer from overhead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like kind of,</v>

1501
00:50:57.441 --> 00:50:58.700
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of neat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

1502
00:50:58.730 --> 00:51:00.770
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like just watching somebody with a</v>

1503
00:51:00.771 --> 00:51:03.980
<v Speaker 2>bald spot on the top of their head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's really close.</v>

1504
00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:07.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's Lebanese and hey look at me.</v>

1505
00:51:07.690 --> 00:51:11.150
<v Speaker 2>And they gave me pain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fanny and down clapping.</v>

1506
00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:12.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sell.</v>

1507
00:51:14.540 --> 00:51:16.730
<v Speaker 2>I imagined it was taller than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>

1508
00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:20.290
<v Speaker 2>My memory's not that good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1509
00:51:20.390 --> 00:51:21.223
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Getting whole day.</v>

1510
00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:22.193
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1511
00:51:22.490 --> 00:51:26.060
<v Speaker 2>Well it's just getting weird because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's got too much shit in there.</v>

1512
00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:28.610
<v Speaker 2>My brain has too much information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're running that a room?</v>

1513
00:51:28.630 --> 00:51:29.660
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

1514
00:51:29.661 --> 00:51:32.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm a deleting space on my hard drive</v>
<v Speaker 2>for new thing.</v>

1515
00:51:32.130 --> 00:51:34.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like seventh grade I went to seventh</v>

1516
00:51:34.671 --> 00:51:36.140
<v Speaker 2>grade done cheese.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>

1517
00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:41.780
<v Speaker 2>What happened to that seventh grade?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Funny that you know who needs curse if</v>

1518
00:51:41.810 --> 00:51:44.000
<v Speaker 2>am I right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder what John's doing.</v>

1519
00:51:44.001 --> 00:51:45.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder why he stopped doing standup</v>

1520
00:51:45.810 --> 00:51:48.050
<v Speaker 2>because he was actually pretty funny and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>

1521
00:51:48.170 --> 00:51:52.430
<v Speaker 2>it was weird because he was already</v>
<v Speaker 2>famous and one of the things was like I,</v>

1522
00:51:53.130 --> 00:51:56.780
<v Speaker 2>I had tried to encourage Phil Hartman to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do stand up several times because he</v>

1523
00:51:56.781 --> 00:51:59.480
<v Speaker 2>would do standup where he would warm up</v>

<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good for him.</v>

1545
00:52:52.041 --> 00:52:53.140
<v Speaker 2>Good for him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>

1546
00:52:53.141 --> 00:52:54.810

<v Speaker 2>Great Guy.</v>

1547
00:52:55.070 --> 00:52:57.800
<v Speaker 2>When I did SNL,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was the first season where he</v>

1548
00:52:57.801 --> 00:52:58.970
<v Speaker 2>had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had just left.</v>

1549
00:52:58.970 --> 00:53:03.710
<v Speaker 2>I think because I did it pretty much</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably if I had to pick a season,</v>

1550
00:53:03.740 --> 00:53:05.510
<v Speaker 2>I would have been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would have been that when I did.</v>

1551
00:53:05.780 --> 00:53:07.670
<v Speaker 2>Because you still had carvey and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>still had,</v>

1552
00:53:07.671 --> 00:53:09.740

<v Speaker 2>She's a hardcore conservative now.</v>

00:53:19.070 --> 00:53:21.350
<v Speaker 2>Huge like right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right winger.</v>

1557
00:53:21.380 --> 00:53:22.640

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1558
00:53:22.641 --> 00:53:24.850

1560
00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:28.711
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like she,</v>

1561
00:53:28.711 --> 00:53:33.711
<v Speaker 2>she shouted from the mountaintops,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was she like when you met her?</v>

1562
00:53:33.930 --> 00:53:35.090
<v Speaker 2>She was fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean listen,</v>

1563
00:53:35.180 --> 00:53:36.650
<v Speaker 2>it was she conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

1564
00:53:36.660 --> 00:53:39.240
<v Speaker 2>I was busy doing the show kind of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

1565
00:53:39.910 --> 00:53:41.650
<v Speaker 2>Cause it's a lot of work and mature now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

1566
00:53:41.660 --> 00:53:43.330
<v Speaker 2>that I had to do a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1567
00:53:43.890 --> 00:53:46.260
<v Speaker 2>I had to do it without cue cards cause</v>
<v Speaker 2>my father didn't want me to use cue</v>

1568
00:53:46.261 --> 00:53:46.680
<v Speaker 2>cards.</v>

1569
00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:48.840
<v Speaker 2>So I don't like to memorize all that</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

1570
00:53:48.870 --> 00:53:52.140
<v Speaker 2>Plus plus plus the skits that didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>even make it into the show.</v>

1571
00:53:52.141 --> 00:53:53.970
<v Speaker 2>So I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to memorize like schizo didn't</v>

1572
00:53:53.971 --> 00:53:55.580
<v Speaker 2>even end up in the sheets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1573
00:53:56.570 --> 00:53:57.640

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1574
00:53:58.290 --> 00:54:00.150
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a good memory and he didn't want</v>

1575
00:54:00.151 --> 00:54:01.140
<v Speaker 2>me reading.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1576
00:54:01.150 --> 00:54:02.280
<v Speaker 2>cause it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see it,</v>

1577
00:54:02.310 --> 00:54:05.070
<v Speaker 2>they can see it when people are reading.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he didn't want me to do in that,</v>

1578
00:54:05.100 --> 00:54:05.800
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1579
00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:09.480
<v Speaker 2>So Nokia card,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also that means the other actors do</v>

1580
00:54:09.481 --> 00:54:10.710
<v Speaker 2>cue card for them either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1581
00:54:10.711 --> 00:54:11.850
<v Speaker 2>of course not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1582
00:54:12.370 --> 00:54:12.991
<v Speaker 2>they had like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1583
00:54:12.991 --> 00:54:15.270
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure my father made a lot of friends</v>

1584
00:54:15.271 --> 00:54:16.104
<v Speaker 2>looking at him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1586
00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:21.630

<v Speaker 2>Like how can he dictate whether or not</v>

1587
00:54:21.631 --> 00:54:24.390
<v Speaker 2>the other actors get cue cards?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1588
00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:28.200
<v Speaker 2>Cause it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he apparently he could.</v>

1589
00:54:29.150 --> 00:54:31.320
<v Speaker 2>Victoria Jackson's a hardcore</v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative,</v>

1590
00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:32.460
<v Speaker 2>so straight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

1591
00:54:32.461 --> 00:54:34.480
<v Speaker 2>she shouted from the mountaintops and</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

<v Speaker 2>that kind of late eighties group.</v>

1595
00:54:39.830 --> 00:54:41.070
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then also it was a,</v>

1596
00:54:41.580 --> 00:54:43.650
<v Speaker 2>it was mick Meyer a second season,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

1597
00:54:43.651 --> 00:54:44.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was in,</v>

<v Speaker 2>See gonna Richard Dawson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy who was in Hogan's heroes with</v>

1859
01:06:15.641 --> 01:06:17.500
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was that fucking movie?</v>

1860
01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:18.780
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:24.400
<v Speaker 2>eight or eight millimeter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of those.</v>

1862
01:06:24.410 --> 01:06:28.690
<v Speaker 2>It's not that the movie where who?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was that guy's name?</v>

1863
01:06:28.780 --> 01:06:32.080
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was apparently he was the guy who was</v>

1864
01:06:32.081 --> 01:06:35.260
<v Speaker 2>the star of Hogan's heroes and then he</v>
<v Speaker 2>just became the freak of the week.</v>

1865
01:06:35.260 --> 01:06:39.030
<v Speaker 2>He just got homemade porno.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all he did.</v>

1866
01:06:39.031 --> 01:06:44.031
<v Speaker 2>That's all he did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they think the guy he did porn</v>

1867
01:06:44.081 --> 01:06:47.980
<v Speaker 2>with killed him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe his murder was never saw,</v>

1868
01:06:48.340 --> 01:06:53.340
<v Speaker 2>but there was some sort of extenuating</v>
<v Speaker 2>circumstances that connected his,</v>

1869
01:06:54.790 --> 01:06:57.520
<v Speaker 2>his porn buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy was in the movie.</v>

1870
01:06:57.550 --> 01:06:59.980
<v Speaker 2>I think they maybe that was what they</v>
<v Speaker 2>implied in the movie.</v>

1871
01:07:00.130 --> 01:07:01.600
<v Speaker 2>I think that was what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1872
01:07:01.601 --> 01:07:02.950
<v Speaker 2>if it was in a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has to be true.</v>

1873
01:07:03.850 --> 01:07:05.170
<v Speaker 2>You know it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't ever lie.</v>

1874
01:07:05.171 --> 01:07:06.160
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crime.</v>

1875
01:07:06.250 --> 01:07:08.740
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing about movies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When they do a story about your life,</v>

1876
01:07:08.741 --> 01:07:10.510
<v Speaker 2>they don't change shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1877
01:07:10.570 --> 01:07:14.920
<v Speaker 2>They literally get every word right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise they would lose credibility.</v>

1878
01:07:15.370 --> 01:07:16.203
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

1879
01:07:16.630 --> 01:07:17.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1880
01:07:17.711 --> 01:07:19.800
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's movies where they change shit.</v>

1881
01:07:19.810 --> 01:07:21.430
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why did you change that?</v>

1882
01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:25.220
<v Speaker 2>Like they just decide to like his</v>
<v Speaker 2>historical things like,</v>

1883
01:07:26.170 --> 01:07:29.260
<v Speaker 2>oh it's creative license or like we have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to condense things because a person's</v>

1884
01:07:29.261 --> 01:07:30.510
<v Speaker 2>life is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1885
01:07:30.580 --> 01:07:32.470
<v Speaker 2>so long and things like that.</v>

1886
01:07:32.650 --> 01:07:34.950
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember that movie about um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1887
01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:36.590
<v Speaker 2>the movie with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1888
01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:38.470
<v Speaker 2>it was with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1889
01:07:39.310 --> 01:07:42.560
<v Speaker 2>what's his name from the office?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1890
01:07:42.630 --> 01:07:46.210
<v Speaker 2>Steve Carell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He played that catch her.</v>

1891
01:07:46.270 --> 01:07:48.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were both thinking the same thing.</v>

1892
01:07:48.190 --> 01:07:50.270
<v Speaker 2>I was just waiting to get the</v>
<v Speaker 2>description cause I was going to say</v>

1893
01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:51.400
<v Speaker 2>foxcatcher he's back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1894
01:07:51.401 --> 01:07:53.740
<v Speaker 2>not that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that movie's based on two very famous</v>

1895
01:07:53.741 --> 01:07:56.440
<v Speaker 2>wrestlers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dave Schultz and Marshall and in the</v>

1896
01:07:56.441 --> 01:08:01.441
<v Speaker 2>movie they put a ton of bullshit in</v>
<v Speaker 2>there and don't mean a lot of in mark</v>

1897
01:08:01.601 --> 01:08:04.410
<v Speaker 2>was furious when the movie came out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember reading that and he,</v>

1898
01:08:04.420 --> 01:08:06.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he went on a crazy wild twitter storm.</v>

1899
01:08:06.731 --> 01:08:09.220
<v Speaker 2>But then after that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the end of the movie,</v>

1900
01:08:09.340 --> 01:08:11.440
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a historic moment in that,</v>

1901
01:08:11.980 --> 01:08:14.680
<v Speaker 2>in that movie that they just completely</v>
<v Speaker 2>made up.</v>

1902
01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:18.050
<v Speaker 2>Like he fought this guy named big daddy</v>
<v Speaker 2>goodrich in the UFC.</v>

1903
01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:20.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sports history and in terms of the,</v>

1904
01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:23.150
<v Speaker 2>it sounds like that sounds like a wwe</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrestler.</v>

1905
01:08:23.150 --> 01:08:26.480
<v Speaker 2>I know it does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could have been a wwe wrestler,</v>

1906
01:08:26.810 --> 01:08:29.080
<v Speaker 2>but a big daddy goodrich who's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1907
01:08:29.090 --> 01:08:32.140
<v Speaker 2>really a pioneer in mma fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1908
01:08:32.510 --> 01:08:36.850
<v Speaker 2>was this big fucking Jack Black Guy who</v>
<v Speaker 2>wore a,</v>

1909
01:08:36.851 --> 01:08:39.470
<v Speaker 2>a gay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wore like a traditional karate</v>

1910
01:08:39.471 --> 01:08:43.910
<v Speaker 2>getting into the octagon in the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have him fighting a white guy,</v>

1911
01:08:44.300 --> 01:08:45.710
<v Speaker 2>a Russian guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whitewash.</v>

1912
01:08:45.711 --> 01:08:49.040
<v Speaker 2>And they just decided they don't want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>see why guys.</v>

1913
01:08:49.220 --> 01:08:49.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1914
01:08:49.610 --> 01:08:51.380

<v Speaker 2>we have,</v>

1915
01:08:51.381 --> 01:08:52.730
<v Speaker 2>we have to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Russians was like,</v>

1916
01:08:52.731 --> 01:08:57.080
<v Speaker 2>why would you change the race and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>name of the guy he fought?</v>

1917
01:08:57.270 --> 01:08:59.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just seems like weird and like petty</v>

1918
01:08:59.601 --> 01:09:03.590
<v Speaker 2>almost till you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's this weird greasy producers who</v>

1919

<v Speaker 2>truth right in your face.</v>

<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

01:09:30.051 --> 01:09:31.970
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't the 80s well,</v>

<v Speaker 2>isn't it the case?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Please note takers in the 90s.</v>

<v Speaker 2>it was a,</v>

1937
01:09:35.631 --> 01:09:39.560

<v Speaker 2>Angle,</v>

1938
01:09:39.561 --> 01:09:41.340

<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1939
01:09:41.570 --> 01:09:43.340
<v Speaker 2>in that facility,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Fox catcher.</v>

1940
01:09:43.420 --> 01:09:46.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's talked about that.</v>

1941
01:09:46.050 --> 01:09:50.040
<v Speaker 2>You know how crazy that guy was just</v>
<v Speaker 2>decided to set up some wrestling thing</v>

1942
01:09:50.041 --> 01:09:51.770
<v Speaker 2>so you could get like weird with these</v>
<v Speaker 2>dudes,</v>

1943
01:09:52.380 --> 01:09:57.080
<v Speaker 2>like a bunch of strong sweaty men like</v>
<v Speaker 2>rubbing up against each other.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I bet you those red lose like wrestlers,</v>

1945
01:10:00.201 --> 01:10:02.720

<v Speaker 2>I bet you whoever their training with</v>

1946
01:10:02.780 --> 01:10:05.120
<v Speaker 2>knows their body better than their</v>
<v Speaker 2>wives.</v>

1947
01:10:05.590 --> 01:10:07.400
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a really intimate thing.</v>

1948
01:10:07.430 --> 01:10:07.791
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1949
01:10:07.791 --> 01:10:12.791
<v Speaker 2>I bet you they know every curve of their</v>
<v Speaker 2>trainee losing weight here at Tom.</v>

1950
01:10:12.910 --> 01:10:13.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

1951
01:10:13.830 --> 01:10:17.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to cinch this grip around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your waist just feels like a little</v>

1952
01:10:17.841 --> 01:10:18.630
<v Speaker 2>easier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1953
01:10:18.630 --> 01:10:21.650
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is intimate sport.</v>

1954
01:10:21.710 --> 01:10:25.340
<v Speaker 2>We're not some shoulder muscle</v>
<v Speaker 2>weight a little.</v>

1955
01:10:25.341 --> 01:10:26.091
<v Speaker 2>So all that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1956
01:10:26.091 --> 01:10:30.870
<v Speaker 2>say I had a gun and your baton.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1957
01:10:30.871 --> 01:10:34.700
<v Speaker 2>I remember when he was like in the movie</v>
<v Speaker 2>Steve Carell was so good in that movie.</v>

1958
01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:38.090
<v Speaker 2>I loved him and that God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he played that creep so well because he</v>

1959
01:10:38.091 --> 01:10:41.690
<v Speaker 2>played it like a guy who's like a loose</v>
<v Speaker 2>cannon,</v>

1960
01:10:41.691 --> 01:10:43.530
<v Speaker 2>like creepy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>weird and loose cannon,</v>

1961
01:10:43.531 --> 01:10:45.500
<v Speaker 2>small,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know the way he kind of like his</v>

1962
01:10:45.501 --> 01:10:47.570
<v Speaker 2>movements and his speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was good.</v>

1963
01:10:47.571 --> 01:10:49.880
<v Speaker 2>It was good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember when he was like,</v>

1964
01:10:49.881 --> 01:10:54.290
<v Speaker 2>he decided he was going to coach and</v>
<v Speaker 2>coach the wrestlers and show them how to</v>

1965
01:10:54.291 --> 01:10:57.000
<v Speaker 2>do certain moves and everybody just sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of tolerated.</v>

1966
01:10:57.050 --> 01:10:59.540
<v Speaker 2>Then they're kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh let them and let them have this one</v>

1967
01:10:59.910 --> 01:11:02.030
<v Speaker 2>strain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what a great scene.</v>

1968
01:11:02.150 --> 01:11:06.320
<v Speaker 2>But here's the thing like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that scene was so good,</v>

1969
01:11:06.470 --> 01:11:09.530
<v Speaker 2>but now I know you lied at the end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I know you lied to the end of the</v>

1970
01:11:09.531 --> 01:11:10.310
<v Speaker 2>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now I go,</v>

1971
01:11:10.310 --> 01:11:12.200
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you make up that scene starts losing</v>

1972
01:11:12.201 --> 01:11:13.700
<v Speaker 2>credibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did watch it.</v>

1973
01:11:13.701 --> 01:11:14.070
<v Speaker 2>I did watch</v>

1974
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:17.450
<v Speaker 1>a doc about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a 30 for 30 about the</v>

1975
01:11:17.460 --> 01:11:19.860
<v Speaker 1>Fox catcher institute or whatever it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>

1976
01:11:19.890 --> 01:11:23.370
<v Speaker 1>There was a lot of footage on that guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Corel fucking nailed it.</v>

1977
01:11:23.650 --> 01:11:24.660
<v Speaker 1>Dupont,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dupont,</v>

1978
01:11:25.020 --> 01:11:25.980
<v Speaker 1>dupont.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1979
01:11:26.010 --> 01:11:26.761
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1980
01:11:26.761 --> 01:11:28.350
<v Speaker 1>What a strange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strange guy.</v>

1981
01:11:28.351 --> 01:11:33.351
<v Speaker 1>That guy was mister dupont.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a unfortunate thing about those</v>

1982
01:11:33.511 --> 01:11:36.420
<v Speaker 1>wrestlers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's no real professional venue</v>

1983
01:11:36.450 --> 01:11:38.460
<v Speaker 1>other than fighting if they want to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>into mma.</v>

1984
01:11:38.940 --> 01:11:42.930
<v Speaker 1>And he was a coach at Brigham Young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mark Schultz was and he just,</v>

1985
01:11:43.230 --> 01:11:45.840
<v Speaker 1>he fought one time in the UFC and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>just stayed.</v>

1986
01:11:46.290 --> 01:11:47.790
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they wanted him doing it.</v>

1987
01:11:47.850 --> 01:11:51.750
<v Speaker 1>I think that was part of the dispute is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that his coach believe it was Brigham</v>

1988
01:11:51.750 --> 01:11:52.301
<v Speaker 1>Young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

1989
01:11:52.301 --> 01:11:54.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the school that he was coaching for,</v>

1990
01:11:54.001 --> 01:11:54.810
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

1991
01:11:54.810 --> 01:11:56.510
<v Speaker 1>you want a coach here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can't be cage fight.</v>

1992
01:11:56.630 --> 01:11:59.970
<v Speaker 1>Cause especially like early,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like MMA was not respected at all.</v>

1993
01:12:00.140 --> 01:12:01.860
<v Speaker 1>I remember John Mccain trying to let you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1994
01:12:01.861 --> 01:12:03.720
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it was a blood sport and he kept</v>

1995
01:12:03.721 --> 01:12:04.890
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what that was about?</v>

1996
01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:09.210
<v Speaker 1>That was about Budweiser because</v>
<v Speaker 1>budweiser sponsored boxing and MMA was</v>

1997
01:12:09.420 --> 01:12:13.520
<v Speaker 1>doing very well with paper view back</v>
<v Speaker 1>then and they wanted to uh,</v>

1998
01:12:13.650 --> 01:12:17.220
<v Speaker 1>stop it in its tracks and budweiser was</v>
<v Speaker 1>a big part of that.</v>

1999
01:12:17.221 --> 01:12:20.400
<v Speaker 1>And Budweiser sort of got behind him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all greasy.</v>

2000
01:12:20.580 --> 01:12:22.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the boxing world is so Greece</v>

2001
01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:24.690
<v Speaker 1>cause I'm a fight fan at least like</v>
<v Speaker 1>boxing.</v>

2002
01:12:24.691 --> 01:12:26.430
<v Speaker 1>I was kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're always kind of raised that way.</v>

2003
01:12:26.431 --> 01:12:28.470

2028
01:13:18.511 --> 01:13:21.390
<v Speaker 1>it was a great boxer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time I just remember</v>

2029
01:13:21.391 --> 01:13:22.440
<v Speaker 1>being driven nuts.</v>

2030
01:13:22.470 --> 01:13:23.670
<v Speaker 1>Like where he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

2031
01:13:23.700 --> 01:13:27.390
<v Speaker 1>where is like belt like up to here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it was like way past his belly</v>

2032
01:13:27.391 --> 01:13:29.130
<v Speaker 1>button and he's 48.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's already like six,</v>

2033
01:13:29.131 --> 01:13:31.380
<v Speaker 1>six already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's kind of just like,</v>

2034
01:13:31.381 --> 01:13:32.214
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he's,</v>

2035
01:13:32.220 --> 01:13:33.780
<v Speaker 1>he's wearing that thing too high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2036
01:13:33.781 --> 01:13:35.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he's getting away with murder like</v>

2037
01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:37.410
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what kind of thing it shouldn't,</v>

2038
01:13:37.450 --> 01:13:37.981
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2039
01:13:37.981 --> 01:13:39.500
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm surprised you've got away with that,</v>

2040
01:13:39.501 --> 01:13:40.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that equipment,</v>

2041
01:13:40.860 --> 01:13:43.250
<v Speaker 1>but both,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most referees will tell you you can hit</v>

2042
01:13:43.251 --> 01:13:44.400
<v Speaker 1>him here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2043
01:13:45.100 --> 01:13:46.110
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

2044
01:13:46.111 --> 01:13:48.120
<v Speaker 1>it was kind of just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it felt like an unfair advantage,</v>

2045
01:13:48.121 --> 01:13:50.640
<v Speaker 1>especially for a guy who was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

2046
01:13:50.641 --> 01:13:52.560
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six getting at and so ready.</v>

2047
01:13:52.561 --> 01:13:53.394
<v Speaker 1>Enormous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2048
01:13:53.430 --> 01:13:54.211
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2049
01:13:54.211 --> 01:13:54.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

2050
01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:56.040
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's even higher than normal and that</v>

2051
01:13:56.041 --> 01:13:58.710
<v Speaker 1>would be a big target for somebody who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like only like casino.</v>

2052
01:13:58.950 --> 01:14:01.040
<v Speaker 1>So you follow boxing today though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2053
01:14:01.380 --> 01:14:02.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm really looking forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2054
01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:04.920
<v Speaker 1>I want to see wilder versus a Joshua</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2055
01:14:04.921 --> 01:14:07.960
<v Speaker 1>that's when I want to see in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>heavyweight division for a while tasting</v>

2056
01:14:07.980 --> 01:14:09.970
<v Speaker 1>fury though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he's kind of back in the ring and</v>

2057
01:14:09.971 --> 01:14:12.160
<v Speaker 1>the ties fewer in my them all up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's</v>

2058
01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:15.460
<v Speaker 2>a problem because they're all big guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are big guys.</v>

2059
01:14:15.461 --> 01:14:19.570
<v Speaker 2>But Tyson fury looks fucking fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some footage on his instagram of</v>

2060
01:14:19.571 --> 01:14:22.960
<v Speaker 2>him doing pad work and he's fighting</v>
<v Speaker 2>really soon.</v>

2061
01:14:23.140 --> 01:14:25.360
<v Speaker 2>He just bought like a warm up kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2062

<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

2065
01:14:31.130 --> 01:14:33.970
<v Speaker 2>I think it just happened like air or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something or does he have another one</v>

2066
01:14:33.971 --> 01:14:34.804

<v Speaker 2>I think he's got it.</v>

2067
01:14:34.810 --> 01:14:37.540

01:15:49.810 --> 01:15:51.070
<v Speaker 2>He toyed with Klitschko.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2102
01:15:51.071 --> 01:15:52.270
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

2103
01:15:52.271 --> 01:15:56.080
<v Speaker 2>he's fucking good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he gives people fits yet the new</v>

2104
01:15:56.081 --> 01:15:58.180
<v Speaker 2>rumors is supposed to be wilder versus</v>
<v Speaker 2>fury.</v>

2105
01:15:58.510 --> 01:16:01.240
<v Speaker 2>Now the Joshua like talks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like not happening.</v>

2106
01:16:01.450 --> 01:16:02.980
<v Speaker 2>Well yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2107
01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:06.580
<v Speaker 2>Tyson fury.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He could fuck up that whole thing then.</v>

2108
01:16:06.670 --> 01:16:10.030
<v Speaker 2>So it's the 18th of August and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>both a little unorthodox too.</v>

2109
01:16:10.031 --> 01:16:12.460
<v Speaker 2>So it'd be actually interesting to see</v>
<v Speaker 2>like him square off with wilder.</v>

2110
01:16:12.461 --> 01:16:14.920
<v Speaker 2>Fuck yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're both super long.</v>

2111
01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:16.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be very interesting.</v>

2112
01:16:16.751 --> 01:16:19.150
<v Speaker 2>But I think it would be like the first</v>
<v Speaker 2>time who others finding somebody who's</v>

2113
01:16:19.151 --> 01:16:22.000
<v Speaker 2>bigger than him do not just bigger but</v>
<v Speaker 2>super slick.</v>

2114
01:16:22.001 --> 01:16:23.410
<v Speaker 2>He's going to give him fits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

2115
01:16:23.620 --> 01:16:24.420
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean look,</v>

2116
01:16:24.420 --> 01:16:27.370
<v Speaker 2>wilder can knock out anybody but Tyson</v>
<v Speaker 2>fury he,</v>

2117
01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:29.700
<v Speaker 2>he'll give you fits like that guys.</v>

2118
01:16:29.780 --> 01:16:33.630
<v Speaker 2>Cause Wilder is like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like 37 and hoe with 36 knockouts things</v>

2119
01:16:33.820 --> 01:16:35.770
<v Speaker 2>once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it's crazy.</v>

2120
01:16:36.010 --> 01:16:37.430
<v Speaker 2>That's a crazy record.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

2121
01:16:38.110 --> 01:16:41.050
<v Speaker 2>It's tasting esque like young Tyson has</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then they're completely different</v>

2122
01:16:41.051 --> 01:16:43.960
<v Speaker 2>fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Young Tyson was just so tight and like,</v>

2123
01:16:43.961 --> 01:16:46.000
<v Speaker 2>you know like and wilders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he puts his hands down,</v>

2124
01:16:46.420 --> 01:16:48.590
<v Speaker 2>he wants to counter punch like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's his whole thing.</v>

2125
01:16:48.620 --> 01:16:50.460
<v Speaker 2>What's interesting is people still don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>believe in,</v>

2126
01:16:50.470 --> 01:16:52.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had heard that the Anthony Joshua</v>

2127
01:16:52.511 --> 01:16:54.070
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I would think that that would be</v>

2128
01:16:54.071 --> 01:16:56.590
<v Speaker 2>like a pretty evenly matched fight that</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are like,</v>

2129
01:16:56.591 --> 01:16:57.424
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no gosh,</v>

2130
01:16:57.440 --> 01:17:00.030
<v Speaker 2>it was heads up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heads above everybody else.</v>

2131
01:17:00.060 --> 01:17:00.970
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2132
01:17:00.971 --> 01:17:02.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm not so sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

2133
01:17:02.021 --> 01:17:04.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you take it on some good challenges</v>

2134
01:17:04.421 --> 01:17:05.740
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like Joshua can go,</v>

2135
01:17:05.800 --> 01:17:07.930
<v Speaker 2>we can do some amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't get me wrong,</v>

2136
01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:10.370
<v Speaker 2>but he got knocked down by Klitschko</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tyson</v>

2137
01:17:10.370 --> 01:17:15.370
<v Speaker 1>fury toward with Klitschko putting his</v>
<v Speaker 1>hands behind his back and maybe it was</v>

2138
01:17:16.130 --> 01:17:18.950
<v Speaker 1>not the same as prepared a Klitschko.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2139
01:17:18.951 --> 01:17:21.110
<v Speaker 1>fighters are different for every fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which goes like,</v>

2140
01:17:21.111 --> 01:17:23.000
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like aging obviously.</v>

2141
01:17:23.001 --> 01:17:24.350
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At that point.</v>

2142
01:17:24.670 --> 01:17:27.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I just think that that style,</v>

2143
01:17:27.111 --> 01:17:29.060
<v Speaker 1>that Tyson fury style,</v>
<v Speaker 1>avoid that shit.</v>

2144
01:17:29.061 --> 01:17:31.350
<v Speaker 1>Like measles get away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2145
01:17:31.730 --> 01:17:34.900
<v Speaker 1>There's a reason why Joshua doesn't want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to fight wilder or fury.</v>

2146
01:17:34.940 --> 01:17:37.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause also he is the top draw right now.</v>

2147
01:17:37.730 --> 01:17:38.980
<v Speaker 1>Like he can sell out like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2148
01:17:38.990 --> 01:17:42.410
<v Speaker 1>like 40 50,000 in his home country where</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like wilder,</v>

2149
01:17:42.411 --> 01:17:43.380
<v Speaker 1>like in his home state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

2150
01:17:43.460 --> 01:17:46.340
<v Speaker 1>he fights a lot in Alabama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's like 10,000 or something like</v>

2151
01:17:46.341 --> 01:17:48.260
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Joshua was a bigger draw.</v>

2152
01:17:48.410 --> 01:17:50.810
<v Speaker 1>Well he's becoming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think while there is becoming a bigger</v>

2153
01:17:50.811 --> 01:17:55.220
<v Speaker 1>draw nationally now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that's also one of the</v>

2154
01:17:55.221 --> 01:17:56.060
<v Speaker 1>things with boxing.</v>

2155
01:17:56.060 --> 01:17:57.440
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're always trying to figure out</v>

2156
01:17:57.441 --> 01:17:59.090
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when do we make this fight?</v>

2157
01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:01.640
<v Speaker 1>Do we make it now or do we wait a couple</v>
<v Speaker 1>of months?</v>

2158
01:18:01.670 --> 01:18:04.060
<v Speaker 1>Let me see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The year undefeated champions find each</v>

2159
01:18:04.061 --> 01:18:05.210
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that doesn't really happen that</v>

2160
01:18:05.211 --> 01:18:07.040
<v Speaker 1>often,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in the heavyweight division.</v>

2161
01:18:07.380 --> 01:18:09.200
<v Speaker 1>It could be like something that's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>really special.</v>

2162
01:18:09.260 --> 01:18:11.390
<v Speaker 1>Someone could fuck up and lose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2163
01:18:11.420 --> 01:18:12.800
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

2164
01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:17.090
<v Speaker 1>It made me whether Pacquiao all over</v>
<v Speaker 1>again where it's like it happened,</v>

2165
01:18:17.091 --> 01:18:18.280
<v Speaker 1>but it happened too late.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

2166
01:18:18.650 --> 01:18:19.880
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2167
01:18:19.910 --> 01:18:22.790
<v Speaker 1>So it get stay the fuck away from Tyson</v>
<v Speaker 1>fury kids.</v>

2168
01:18:22.870 --> 01:18:26.150
<v Speaker 1>What'd you think about the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Mcgregor Mayweather fight?</v>

2169
01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:29.330
<v Speaker 1>It went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did much better than I thought he was</v>

2170
01:18:29.331 --> 01:18:30.420
<v Speaker 1>going to get me to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2171
01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:34.940
<v Speaker 1>but I think that may,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it was probably wanting to wear</v>

2172
01:18:34.941 --> 01:18:39.290
<v Speaker 1>him out and so allowed him to explain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he did catch me whether with a very</v>

2173
01:18:39.291 --> 01:18:42.610
<v Speaker 1>clean left was rabbit punching the whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>time that was driving me insane.</v>

2174
01:18:42.610 --> 01:18:44.600
<v Speaker 1>Just kept on just punching the back of</v>
<v Speaker 1>his head.</v>

2175
01:18:44.601 --> 01:18:45.331
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't like them.</v>

2176
01:18:45.331 --> 01:18:47.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm surprised that the left hand</v>
<v Speaker 1>hammered.</v>

2177
01:18:47.900 --> 01:18:48.700
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2178
01:18:48.700 --> 01:18:49.760
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't do that.</v>

2179
01:18:49.870 --> 01:18:51.320
<v Speaker 1>Look at me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm surprised like the ref,</v>

2180
01:18:51.321 --> 01:18:52.880
<v Speaker 1>like let them get away with murder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

2181
01:18:54.970 --> 01:18:58.100
<v Speaker 1>I think you wanted to frustrate me her</v>
<v Speaker 1>and get me whether to try to stay open</v>

2182
01:18:58.101 --> 01:19:00.680
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe whether it's defense is like</v>

2183
01:19:00.890 --> 01:19:02.100
<v Speaker 1>fantastic and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2184
01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:04.400
<v Speaker 1>he came in there like mayweather fought</v>
<v Speaker 1>a perfect kind of fight.</v>

2185
01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:05.000
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

2186
01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:06.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to let this guy get himself</v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

2187
01:19:06.470 --> 01:19:08.530
<v Speaker 1>And that's exactly what he did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well because we were going to knock</v>

2188
01:19:08.531 --> 01:19:09.920
<v Speaker 1>knockout artist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he knocked him out.</v>

2189
01:19:10.250 --> 01:19:13.100
<v Speaker 1>He definitely stopped him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Connor is not known for his cardio.</v>

2190
01:19:13.150 --> 01:19:13.480
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2191
01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:15.070
<v Speaker 1>he's a fast twitch guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2192
01:19:15.860 --> 01:19:18.680
<v Speaker 1>I think it was when they opened up the</v>
<v Speaker 1>books for that fight,</v>

2193
01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:21.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a thousand to one from Mcgregor</v>

2194
01:19:21.261 --> 01:19:22.280
<v Speaker 1>to win by decision.</v>

2195
01:19:23.180 --> 01:19:24.590
<v Speaker 1>I listen to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I almost,</v>

2196
01:19:24.591 --> 01:19:26.300
<v Speaker 1>I almost put a grand on that just</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>

2197
01:19:26.301 --> 01:19:29.380
<v Speaker 1>just on principle just to see like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

2198
01:19:29.480 --> 01:19:30.660
<v Speaker 1>I just want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want,</v>

2199
01:19:31.160 --> 01:19:36.160
<v Speaker 1>I just want $1 million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a reason why no one.</v>

2200
01:19:36.291 --> 01:19:37.970
<v Speaker 1>But I kinda wanna just sit there and</v>
<v Speaker 1>like turn to my friends.</v>

2201
01:19:37.971 --> 01:19:40.430
<v Speaker 1>Like I think I just won $1 million</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>

2202
01:19:40.431 --> 01:19:42.530
<v Speaker 1>That would be to win $1 million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're putting dots,</v>

2203
01:19:42.580 --> 01:19:43.730
<v Speaker 1>I guess that was in del,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet</v>

2204
01:19:46.460 --> 01:19:47.750
<v Speaker 1>there's been some crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but those,</v>

2205
01:19:47.780 --> 01:19:50.270
<v Speaker 1>those bets are nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like will it make it out of the first</v>

2206
01:19:50.271 --> 01:19:51.500
<v Speaker 1>round?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well yeah,</v>

2207
01:19:51.540 --> 01:19:53.810
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By decision even have like</v>

2208
01:19:53.811 --> 01:19:55.530
<v Speaker 1>disqualification beds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2209
01:19:56.110 --> 01:19:56.950
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

2210
01:19:56.990 --> 01:20:00.380
<v Speaker 1>I used to play a lot of cards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love prop bets.</v>

2211
01:20:00.820 --> 01:20:01.561
<v Speaker 1>Just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2212
01:20:01.561 --> 01:20:02.900
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in that moment it was like,</v>

2213
01:20:03.110 --> 01:20:04.850
<v Speaker 1>I bet you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can guess within,</v>

2214
01:20:04.851 --> 01:20:06.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a $100 how many chips are in front of</v>

2215
01:20:06.711 --> 01:20:06.770

2333
01:24:32.590 --> 01:24:36.730
<v Speaker 2>well I bet he was probably in his</v>
<v Speaker 2>thirties because people back then just</v>

2334
01:24:36.731 --> 01:24:38.170
<v Speaker 2>aged worse.</v>

<v Speaker 2>it's the,</v>

2338
01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:45.940
<v Speaker 2>it's the liquor and cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cigarettes and liquor.</v>

2363
01:25:56.291 --> 01:25:59.290
<v Speaker 2>My other favorite James Bond is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>potential James Bond.</v>

2364
01:25:59.300 --> 01:26:02.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if he's a James Bond yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is Idris Elba Idris sell button.</v>

2365
01:26:02.280 --> 01:26:04.340
<v Speaker 2>That's exact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And because</v>

2366
01:26:04.550 --> 01:26:09.550
<v Speaker 1>white people are mad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're fantastic for moving,</v>

2367
01:26:10.110 --> 01:26:11.360
<v Speaker 1>they get like Michael B.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jordan.</v>

2368
01:26:11.361 --> 01:26:13.670
<v Speaker 1>It's like everyone just calm down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at that right there.</v>

2369
01:26:13.700 --> 01:26:15.270
<v Speaker 1>Oh good Lord.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Luna's body.</v>

2370
01:26:15.300 --> 01:26:17.150
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>

2371
01:26:17.700 --> 01:26:18.080
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2372
01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:20.720
<v Speaker 1>he's already kind of got a little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>little like he's got the beginning of,</v>

2373
01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:25.760
<v Speaker 1>of meant it's not bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's better than my body fat.</v>

2374
01:26:26.900 --> 01:26:30.080
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't look like a guy who fought</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a fucking sword for a living.</v>

2375
01:26:30.230 --> 01:26:30.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's how they,</v>

2376
01:26:30.950 --> 01:26:33.790
<v Speaker 1>that's probably closer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like more accurate to what,</v>

2377
01:26:33.850 --> 01:26:35.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what actual,</v>

2378
01:26:35.271 --> 01:26:39.020
<v Speaker 1>like Romans and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not if there were actual gladiator,</v>

2379
01:26:39.410 --> 01:26:41.780
<v Speaker 1>is there an actual gladiator they had a</v>
<v Speaker 1>swing swords around,</v>

2380
01:26:42.020 --> 01:26:43.430
<v Speaker 1>look at that arm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>

2381
01:26:43.431 --> 01:26:48.431
<v Speaker 1>So I'm that army carrying those sorts</v>
<v Speaker 1>lean muscle.</v>

2382
01:26:49.041 --> 01:26:52.570
<v Speaker 1>It's lean muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wirey he got some,</v>

2383
01:26:52.630 --> 01:26:55.790
<v Speaker 1>he got some veins coming out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bro.</v>

2384
01:26:55.791 --> 01:26:58.140
<v Speaker 1>He's jacked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

2385
01:26:58.280 --> 01:26:59.950
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is Kubrick and people,</v>

2386
01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:01.460
<v Speaker 1>people always forget.</v>

2387
01:27:01.490 --> 01:27:03.620
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Confirm that.</v>

2388
01:27:03.621 --> 01:27:06.080
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's amazing.</v>

2389
01:27:06.330 --> 01:27:07.760
<v Speaker 1>Apparently he hated it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2390
01:27:07.761 --> 01:27:08.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2391
01:27:08.210 --> 01:27:09.340
<v Speaker 1>he hated the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2392
01:27:09.350 --> 01:27:11.540
<v Speaker 1>It was probably one of those things he</v>
<v Speaker 1>had to do.</v>

2393
01:27:11.870 --> 01:27:13.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2394
01:27:14.100 --> 01:27:15.140
<v Speaker 1>Geez.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

2395
01:27:15.141 --> 01:27:16.860
<v Speaker 1>I loved his movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2396
01:27:16.940 --> 01:27:18.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2397
01:27:18.171 --> 01:27:21.050
<v Speaker 1>this is actually one of the weaker ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really never read the shining.</v>

2398
01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:22.940
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really interesting.</v>

2399
01:27:22.941 --> 01:27:24.740
<v Speaker 1>Different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stephen King did not like it.</v>

2400
01:27:25.070 --> 01:27:25.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2401
01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:26.750
<v Speaker 1>the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the movie,</v>

2402
01:27:26.780 --> 01:27:30.470
<v Speaker 1>because they did the TV movie in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>early two thousands,</v>

2403
01:27:30.720 --> 01:27:32.240
<v Speaker 1>Stephen [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stephen Webber,</v>

2404
01:27:33.670 --> 01:27:36.230
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just decided that,</v>

2405
01:27:36.530 --> 01:27:40.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Kubrick had made Jack Nicholson</v>

2406
01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:45.280
<v Speaker 1>crazy already and he didn't like that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted a guy that was torn curtain crazy</v>

2407
01:27:46.461 --> 01:27:48.120
<v Speaker 1>by the house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2408
01:27:48.290 --> 01:27:50.890
<v Speaker 1>But then how the fuck are you going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do that in a two hour movie?</v>

2409
01:27:50.920 --> 01:27:52.760
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not scary hedges,</v>

2410
01:27:53.080 --> 01:27:53.601
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2411
01:27:53.601 --> 01:27:54.210
<v Speaker 1>they was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were like,</v>

2412
01:27:54.210 --> 01:27:55.880
<v Speaker 1>there's a thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like probably like,</v>

2413
01:27:55.910 --> 01:27:57.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet you if you,</v>

2414
01:27:57.071 --> 01:27:58.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you read it or whatever,</v>

2415
01:27:58.350 --> 01:27:59.720
<v Speaker 1>it's probably seems creepy.</v>

2416
01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:02.660
<v Speaker 1>Like when he's like talking about how</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hedges are moving when he's not</v>

2417
01:28:02.661 --> 01:28:05.120
<v Speaker 1>looking at stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you physically see it,</v>

2418
01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:07.460
<v Speaker 1>it's not scary at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

2419
01:28:07.461 --> 01:28:07.850
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2420
01:28:07.850 --> 01:28:09.110
<v Speaker 1>Like it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like things like that.</v>

2421
01:28:09.111 --> 01:28:11.330
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just don't think that usually translate,</v>

2422
01:28:11.390 --> 01:28:13.670
<v Speaker 1>but it worked in the book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The book's amazing.</v>

2423
01:28:13.970 --> 01:28:15.860
<v Speaker 1>The books really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a big ass book too.</v>

2424
01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:17.330
<v Speaker 1>It's a Stephen King.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2425
01:28:17.331 --> 01:28:17.931
<v Speaker 1>they're all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

2426
01:28:17.931 --> 01:28:19.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a big ass book.</v>

2427
01:28:20.220 --> 01:28:20.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

2428
01:28:20.710 --> 01:28:23.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm confusing it with the dark tower</v>
<v Speaker 1>series.</v>

2429
01:28:23.630 --> 01:28:25.610
<v Speaker 1>There's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stand is really thick too.</v>

2430
01:28:25.990 --> 01:28:27.740
<v Speaker 1>That's a dictionary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a paper weight.</v>

2431
01:28:28.250 --> 01:28:30.080
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it still is,</v>

2432
01:28:30.081 --> 01:28:32.030
<v Speaker 1>but so fucking prolific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing with the,</v>

2433
01:28:32.180 --> 01:28:33.680
<v Speaker 1>the mazes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

2434
01:28:33.681 --> 01:28:35.330
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the macy's keeps on kind of like</v>

2435
01:28:35.331 --> 01:28:37.820
<v Speaker 1>changing like the one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one that you see in the model there</v>

2436
01:28:37.970 --> 01:28:40.760
<v Speaker 1>and the one that exists and there's also</v>
<v Speaker 1>a map on the outside of it.</v>

2437
01:28:40.910 --> 01:28:45.620
<v Speaker 1>All three of those are different and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bushes and get a look from the top.</v>

2438
01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:47.840
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like kind of more like</v>
<v Speaker 1>stems.</v>

2439
01:28:47.870 --> 01:28:49.550
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they were like thick</v>
<v Speaker 1>branches.</v>

2440
01:28:49.551 --> 01:28:51.470
<v Speaker 1>Hack your way through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Walk Straight.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Plus he's scared of bushes.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That area?</v>

2457
01:29:20.880 --> 01:29:24.180
<v Speaker 1>It's supposed to be somewhere in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Colorado that's like that.</v>

2458
01:29:24.750 --> 01:29:25.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2459
01:29:25.410 --> 01:29:27.690
<v Speaker 1>I think that's where they filmed it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least the out,</v>

2460
01:29:27.720 --> 01:29:28.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the outdoors.</v>

2461
01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:30.960
<v Speaker 1>Some of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think they filmed some of it also</v>

2462
01:29:30.961 --> 01:29:33.150
<v Speaker 1>in upstate New York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a place like,</v>

2463
01:29:33.240 --> 01:29:34.040
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like,</v>

2464
01:29:34.040 --> 01:29:35.310
<v Speaker 1>and then they get like a studio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

2465
01:29:35.340 --> 01:29:38.550
<v Speaker 1>I think it was in London.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Usually Kubrick worked in out of London.</v>

2466
01:29:38.910 --> 01:29:40.200
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>It actually is like,</v>

2468
01:29:42.061 --> 01:29:43.500
<v Speaker 1>it's not called the overlooking in real</v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

2469
01:29:43.501 --> 01:29:44.880
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in Colorado.</v>

2472
01:29:48.690 --> 01:29:50.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't so many of them remember</v>

2473
01:29:50.251 --> 01:29:51.920
<v Speaker 1>eyes wide shut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was another one that was,</v>

2474
01:29:52.630 --> 01:29:54.340

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2475
01:29:54.510 --> 01:29:56.730
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people didn't like that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that was fascinating.</v>

2476
01:29:56.820 --> 01:29:57.300
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2477
01:29:57.300 --> 01:29:59.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm a little soft on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like at least when it comes to like,</v>

2478
01:29:59.850 --> 01:30:00.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's still great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2479
01:30:00.960 --> 01:30:03.130

<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

2487
01:30:15.750 --> 01:30:17.420
<v Speaker 1>It was like a legit genius.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>archives in,</v>

2489

<v Speaker 1>Do you see yourself over making movies</v>
<v Speaker 1>like producing or directing or writing?</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'd be open to doing something that,</v>

2497
01:30:43.201 --> 01:30:44.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

2498
01:30:44.131 --> 01:30:46.350
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a matter of like kind of the right</v>

2499
01:30:46.351 --> 01:30:48.300
<v Speaker 1>kind of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>timing and so forth.</v>

2500
01:30:48.720 --> 01:30:50.910
<v Speaker 1>Like right now it wouldn't be ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like,</v>

2501
01:30:50.911 --> 01:30:52.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a year from now,</v>

2502
01:30:52.201 --> 01:30:53.790
<v Speaker 1>like yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably might be a little freer.</v>

2503
01:30:53.820 --> 01:30:54.840
<v Speaker 1>Like that kind of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2504
01:30:54.841 --> 01:30:55.674
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2505
01:30:55.830 --> 01:30:57.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully the company will be moving on</v>

2506
01:30:57.901 --> 01:30:59.370
<v Speaker 1>to tailored by that and kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2507
01:30:59.450 --> 01:31:01.260
<v Speaker 1>Here's something I want to ask you about</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paris.</v>

2508
01:31:01.320 --> 01:31:03.600
<v Speaker 1>This is one thing that I was only there</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a short period of time,</v>

2509
01:31:03.601 --> 01:31:05.130
<v Speaker 1>but one thing is I was shocked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuck,</v>

2510
01:31:05.580 --> 01:31:10.580
<v Speaker 1>shocked by you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shucked shook is that all those people</v>

2511
01:31:11.140 --> 01:31:16.050
<v Speaker 1>are eating a bread and they're all</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating cheese and wine and no one's fat.</v>

2512
01:31:16.140 --> 01:31:17.670
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is that?</v>

2513
01:31:17.730 --> 01:31:18.451
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

2514
01:31:18.451 --> 01:31:21.360
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of the way that you kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat how you kind of had chemo.</v>

2515
01:31:21.361 --> 01:31:23.190
<v Speaker 1>You have a light breakfast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then a heavy dinner.</v>

2516
01:31:23.220 --> 01:31:24.270
<v Speaker 1>I think that has to do with it.</v>

2517
01:31:24.510 --> 01:31:29.400
<v Speaker 1>And also you can't call yourself a</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] like a bakery and less,</v>

2518
01:31:29.401 --> 01:31:33.910
<v Speaker 1>you make everything from scratch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So everything's made from scratch aid.</v>

2519
01:31:33.911 --> 01:31:35.950
<v Speaker 1>Like the thing is just that like you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2520
01:31:35.970 --> 01:31:39.840
<v Speaker 1>Baguette will be stale in 24 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same thing with the croissants.</v>

2521
01:31:39.841 --> 01:31:44.490
<v Speaker 1>Like there's no preservatives in</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything like all out in general out</v>

2522
01:31:44.491 --> 01:31:47.040
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like all your food spoils faster like in</v>

2523
01:31:47.041 --> 01:31:48.840
<v Speaker 1>your fridge because like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2524
01:31:48.870 --> 01:31:49.620
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2525
01:31:49.620 --> 01:31:50.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fresh.</v>

2526
01:31:50.820 --> 01:31:53.340
<v Speaker 1>There's no hormones and things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steroids.</v>

2527
01:31:53.970 --> 01:31:58.530
<v Speaker 1>He was an oncologist from Paris and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>lived in America and he went back to</v>

2528
01:31:58.531 --> 01:32:03.070
<v Speaker 1>France and brought back cheese because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cheese that he could get over there,</v>

2529
01:32:03.071 --> 01:32:06.520
<v Speaker 1>it was not homogenized or pasteurized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's literally illegal here.</v>

2530
01:32:06.730 --> 01:32:11.730
<v Speaker 1>So he would have to Tuck it in his carry</v>
<v Speaker 1>on or it is a check luggage and just</v>

2531
01:32:11.891 --> 01:32:14.740
<v Speaker 1>hope that no one would check when she</v>
<v Speaker 1>got the wheel of cheese.</v>

2532
01:32:14.980 --> 01:32:17.100
<v Speaker 1>Literally like walked back wheel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>excuse me sir.</v>

2533
01:32:17.300 --> 01:32:19.930
<v Speaker 1>And when he served it to us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like precious,</v>

2534
01:32:20.380 --> 01:32:21.580
<v Speaker 1>this precious cheese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2535
01:32:21.581 --> 01:32:24.880
<v Speaker 1>they make raw cheese and American now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this was,</v>

2536
01:32:25.020 --> 01:32:26.920
<v Speaker 1>but it's like specific and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2537
01:32:26.921 --> 01:32:27.850
<v Speaker 1>like you have to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2538
01:32:27.851 --> 01:32:30.040
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Boutiquey kind of thing,</v>

2539
01:32:30.550 --> 01:32:31.330
<v Speaker 1>cheek,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2540
01:32:31.330 --> 01:32:34.140
<v Speaker 1>niche kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2541
01:32:34.150 --> 01:32:36.880
<v Speaker 1>see thing with things like their eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't refrigerate their eggs over</v>

2542
01:32:36.881 --> 01:32:38.950
<v Speaker 1>there because he's done in the different</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of process.</v>

2543
01:32:39.370 --> 01:32:40.390
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

2544
01:32:40.480 --> 01:32:41.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget what it is,</v>

2545
01:32:41.631 --> 01:32:43.540
<v Speaker 1>have eggs that I get from my chickens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't,</v>

2546
01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:46.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't refrigerate them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the first year after a while you</v>

2547
01:32:46.481 --> 01:32:48.670
<v Speaker 1>can just watch them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think in America it's,</v>

2548
01:32:48.671 --> 01:32:51.310
<v Speaker 1>I think we like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like we,</v>

2549
01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:53.300
<v Speaker 1>I think we like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2550
01:32:53.480 --> 01:32:55.030
<v Speaker 1>like hit him with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're like super hot la.</v>

2551
01:32:55.060 --> 01:32:57.160
<v Speaker 1>There's a different process than they</v>
<v Speaker 1>have in Europe.</v>

2552
01:32:57.400 --> 01:32:59.290
<v Speaker 1>So in general you're not supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>refrigerate it ranks.</v>

2553
01:32:59.291 --> 01:33:02.920
<v Speaker 1>There were in state states are supposed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to just a different,</v>

2554
01:33:02.980 --> 01:33:05.200
<v Speaker 1>it's a different process of how things</v>
<v Speaker 1>are done.</v>

2555
01:33:05.290 --> 01:33:07.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the preservative thing makes a lot of</v>

2556
01:33:07.571 --> 01:33:09.850
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The preservatives and I think there's</v>

2557
01:33:09.851 --> 01:33:13.360
<v Speaker 1>also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's also different shit that's in,</v>

2558
01:33:13.390 --> 01:33:15.400
<v Speaker 1>in wheat and there's different kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>wheat.</v>

2559
01:33:15.430 --> 01:33:17.080
<v Speaker 1>They have heirloom wheat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wheat,</v>

2560
01:33:17.081 --> 01:33:19.460
<v Speaker 1>it's like older wheat before,</v>

<v Speaker 1>grew up Orthodox Jew and he took us</v>

2676
01:37:47.721 --> 01:37:52.721
<v Speaker 1>through this neighborhood where they</v>
<v Speaker 1>have like the crazy frisbee for hats on</v>

2677
01:37:53.860 --> 01:37:57.270
<v Speaker 1>the curls and they pay us and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2678
01:37:57.271 --> 01:37:59.750
<v Speaker 1>the fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the yarn hanging off their belt,</v>

2679
01:37:59.910 --> 01:38:00.750
<v Speaker 1>all the weird shit.</v>

2680
01:38:01.240 --> 01:38:02.940
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was basically saying like,</v>

2681
01:38:02.941 --> 01:38:06.210
<v Speaker 1>these people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they are here but they're not here.</v>

2682
01:38:06.211 --> 01:38:08.190
<v Speaker 1>Like they don't know what the fuck is</v>
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>

2683
01:38:08.191 --> 01:38:11.700
<v Speaker 1>They have no idea who Kim Kardashian is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't listen to any of the music.</v>

2684
01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:14.950
<v Speaker 1>They all stick together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They inner marry the Merion side of the</v>

2685
01:38:14.960 --> 01:38:17.010
<v Speaker 1>community if they get married young and</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at it.</v>

2686
01:38:17.540 --> 01:38:21.030
<v Speaker 1>And it's so interesting seeing them all</v>
<v Speaker 1>walk around the streets,</v>

2687
01:38:21.090 --> 01:38:22.740
<v Speaker 1>the sheets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of them do.</v>

2688
01:38:22.741 --> 01:38:24.810
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not acidic though too.</v>

2689
01:38:24.830 --> 01:38:26.880
<v Speaker 1>So there's just a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a hallway.</v>

2690
01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:29.700
<v Speaker 1>So I think just throw a sheet over and</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

2691
01:38:29.701 --> 01:38:32.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just perfectly framed the vagina right</v>

2692
01:38:32.311 --> 01:38:34.320
<v Speaker 1>there and I'll take care of it from</v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

2693
01:38:34.410 --> 01:38:36.600
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to touch naked women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ryan,</v>

2694
01:38:36.601 --> 01:38:39.030
<v Speaker 1>is that the idea?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a modesty kind of thing.</v>

2695
01:38:39.530 --> 01:38:40.890
<v Speaker 1>Kind of like tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of.</v>

2696
01:38:41.130 --> 01:38:42.780
<v Speaker 1>I just do that at home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just for fun.</v>

2697
01:38:42.930 --> 01:38:43.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

2698
01:38:44.340 --> 01:38:45.060
<v Speaker 1>honey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are these,</v>

2699
01:38:45.060 --> 01:38:47.190
<v Speaker 1>why are there holes and all these sheets</v>
<v Speaker 1>show hush.</v>

2700
01:38:47.250 --> 01:38:51.800
<v Speaker 1>Jesus wants this or</v>
<v Speaker 1>God we killed Jesus.</v>

2701
01:38:54.930 --> 01:38:56.310
<v Speaker 1>Jesus was a Jew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's okay.</v>

2702
01:38:56.760 --> 01:38:58.280
<v Speaker 1>It's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2703
01:38:58.320 --> 01:39:01.380
<v Speaker 1>so like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this community that we were driving</v>

2704
01:39:01.381 --> 01:39:03.930
<v Speaker 1>through is massive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Brooklyn and it was going to say</v>

2705
01:39:03.931 --> 01:39:05.580
<v Speaker 1>Brooklyn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like kind of in the southern kind of</v>

2706
01:39:05.630 --> 01:39:08.370
<v Speaker 1>parch massive community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2707
01:39:08.390 --> 01:39:10.380
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know how big Brooklyn was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2708
01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:11.940
<v Speaker 1>it's big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking huge.</v>

2709
01:39:12.210 --> 01:39:13.060
<v Speaker 1>It really is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2710
01:39:13.061 --> 01:39:15.240
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of like you're talking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the neighborhood that kind of like north</v>

2711
01:39:15.241 --> 01:39:16.770
<v Speaker 1>of Red Hook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but right there on the river.</v>

2712
01:39:16.780 --> 01:39:20.970
<v Speaker 1>Cause I bet I walked from my place in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lower Manhattan all the way down to red</v>

2713
01:39:20.971 --> 01:39:21.750
<v Speaker 1>hook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like one day.</v>

2714
01:39:21.750 --> 01:39:24.390
<v Speaker 1>And as long as it take maybe about an</v>
<v Speaker 1>hour,</v>

2715
01:39:24.780 --> 01:39:25.980
<v Speaker 1>an hour ish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's it.</v>

2716
01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:26.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

2717
01:39:26.930 --> 01:39:27.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I work at,</v>

2718
01:39:27.650 --> 01:39:30.300
<v Speaker 1>I walk in a New York Pace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He must have been sprinting.</v>

2719
01:39:30.390 --> 01:39:30.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2720
01:39:30.980 --> 01:39:31.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm uh,</v>

2721
01:39:31.690 --> 01:39:33.420
<v Speaker 1>I walk into New York base.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on a walker.</v>

2722
01:39:33.421 --> 01:39:36.810
<v Speaker 1>That's how I see something that you run</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven miles an hour.</v>

2723
01:39:36.840 --> 01:39:39.660
<v Speaker 1>That's like a fairly good clip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's gotta be more than seven miles.</v>

2724
01:39:39.750 --> 01:39:40.810
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2725
01:39:41.120 --> 01:39:41.790
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's actually,</v>

2726
01:39:41.790 --> 01:39:44.220
<v Speaker 1>no it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to understand that the whole of</v>

2727
01:39:44.221 --> 01:39:46.230
<v Speaker 1>Manhattan is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like 14 miles,</v>

2728
01:39:46.231 --> 01:39:49.170
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>14 by four and I'm already living in the</v>

2729
01:39:49.171 --> 01:39:50.740
<v Speaker 1>southern part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2730
01:39:50.790 --> 01:39:52.870
<v Speaker 1>It's probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

2731
01:39:52.890 --> 01:39:54.660
<v Speaker 1>like about three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three miles,</v>

2732
01:39:55.080 --> 01:39:57.450
<v Speaker 1>three miles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've walked about three to four miles an</v>

2733
01:39:57.451 --> 01:39:59.550
<v Speaker 1>hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the guys that was there with us,</v>

2734
01:39:59.850 --> 01:40:03.360
<v Speaker 1>the guy who was driving us was telling</v>
<v Speaker 1>us how Brooklyn has just overwhelmed</v>

2735
01:40:03.361 --> 01:40:06.750
<v Speaker 1>with building construction apartment</v>
<v Speaker 1>buildings now.</v>

2736
01:40:06.751 --> 01:40:09.270
<v Speaker 1>And everyone's moving out of Manhattan</v>
<v Speaker 1>into Brooklyn.</v>

2737
01:40:09.290 --> 01:40:10.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2738
01:40:10.020 --> 01:40:13.230
<v Speaker 1>it's because the thing about Manhattan</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that it's finite.</v>

2739
01:40:13.790 --> 01:40:14.191
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2740
01:40:14.191 --> 01:40:17.610
<v Speaker 1>so the only way you can build upwards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can only do that so much.</v>

2741
01:40:17.940 --> 01:40:19.610
<v Speaker 1>And so it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I let people were getting like</v>

2742
01:40:19.650 --> 01:40:21.480
<v Speaker 1>displaced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you have to have enough money just</v>

2743
01:40:21.481 --> 01:40:23.400
<v Speaker 1>to stay on the island of Manhattan.</v>

2744
01:40:23.890 --> 01:40:26.100
<v Speaker 1>And even people like that are getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>displaced then like,</v>

2745
01:40:26.101 --> 01:40:26.581
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2746
01:40:26.581 --> 01:40:27.900
<v Speaker 1>it's Brooklyn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>queens,</v>

2747
01:40:27.960 --> 01:40:29.010
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hoboken,</v>

2748
01:40:29.070 --> 01:40:33.000
<v Speaker 1>the people that I know that live in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Manhattan always have this thought in</v>

2749
01:40:33.001 --> 01:40:34.710
<v Speaker 1>their head that one day they might live</v>
<v Speaker 1>in La.</v>

2750
01:40:35.290 --> 01:40:36.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even bordain was saying,</v>

2751
01:40:37.020 --> 01:40:38.430
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes I think about it,</v>

2752
01:40:38.431 --> 01:40:42.270
<v Speaker 1>I think about the weather and I know</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of good things about La</v>

2753
01:40:42.271 --> 01:40:45.150
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of Nice places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lived here for the better part of</v>

2754
01:40:45.151 --> 01:40:47.820
<v Speaker 1>eight years in my early twenties and</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

2755
01:40:48.120 --> 01:40:48.931
<v Speaker 1>And it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2756
01:40:48.931 --> 01:40:50.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean it makes you soft.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean like,</v>

2757
01:40:50.720 --> 01:40:51.660
<v Speaker 1>cause it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2758
01:40:51.690 --> 01:40:53.770
<v Speaker 1>I think just like with the weather and</v>
<v Speaker 1>things like that.</v>

2759
01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:55.030
<v Speaker 2>And it's also like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2760
01:40:55.031 --> 01:40:56.890
<v Speaker 2>the leisurely kind of like kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

2761
01:40:56.891 --> 01:41:00.130
<v Speaker 2>Like there's not a lot of drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot more smoking weed just</v>

2762
01:41:00.131 --> 01:41:01.990
<v Speaker 2>because like everyone has to drive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2763
01:41:01.991 --> 01:41:02.950
<v Speaker 2>so nobody like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2764
01:41:02.960 --> 01:41:07.960
<v Speaker 2>so everyone just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it went by so fast because there's no</v>

2765
01:41:08.620 --> 01:41:11.080
<v Speaker 2>seasons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all the same.</v>

2766
01:41:11.110 --> 01:41:12.460
<v Speaker 2>So like I blinked and it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

2767
01:41:12.461 --> 01:41:15.610
<v Speaker 2>I've been living here for five years</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'm from New York.</v>

2768
01:41:15.611 --> 01:41:18.350
<v Speaker 2>It's like we have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have our winter winter's long.</v>

2769
01:41:18.351 --> 01:41:22.120
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the major cities like where</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a hundred degree weather shift</v>

2770
01:41:22.121 --> 01:41:25.330
<v Speaker 2>in one year it can be a hundred degrees</v>
<v Speaker 2>and later that you can be zero degrees.</v>

2771
01:41:25.580 --> 01:41:26.890
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>

2772
01:41:27.250 --> 01:41:29.380
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of a harsh kind of climate a</v>

2773
01:41:29.381 --> 01:41:32.650
<v Speaker 2>little bit and the summers they're like</v>
<v Speaker 2>suck cause it's just the humidity.</v>

2774
01:41:32.680 --> 01:41:34.630
<v Speaker 2>It just sticks to you and it's smelly.</v>

2775
01:41:34.660 --> 01:41:36.760
<v Speaker 2>Look at me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a huge fan of New York in the</v>

2776
01:41:36.760 --> 01:41:39.040
<v Speaker 2>summer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gets very pissed like,</v>

2777
01:41:39.090 --> 01:41:40.380
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes you can.</v>

2778
01:41:40.390 --> 01:41:43.740
<v Speaker 2>You can just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it sticks to you at six year hair like</v>

2779
01:41:43.741 --> 01:41:45.280
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He never lived in the city though.</v>

2780
01:41:45.880 --> 01:41:48.040
<v Speaker 2>I might've missed my shot because you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

2781
01:41:48.070 --> 01:41:51.540
<v Speaker 2>now I'm married and kids and the whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>deal and I'm so sorry.</v>

2782
01:41:51.560 --> 01:41:54.670
<v Speaker 2>Kind of stand up comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot of the,</v>

2783
01:41:54.671 --> 01:41:57.850
<v Speaker 2>the the only thing that we could</v>
<v Speaker 2>possibly make me live there is that like</v>

2784
01:41:57.851 --> 01:42:00.000
<v Speaker 2>I could do stand up there very easily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2785
01:42:00.170 --> 01:42:00.701
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>a lot of like,</v>

2787
01:42:01.811 --> 01:42:03.850

2788
01:42:03.851 --> 01:42:05.500
<v Speaker 2>only has like six of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Technically.</v>

2789
