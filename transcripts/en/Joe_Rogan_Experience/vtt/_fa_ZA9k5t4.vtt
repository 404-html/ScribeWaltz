00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:15.870
<v Speaker 1>So a lot has changed since the last time</v>
<v Speaker 1>we spoke and for people who don't know,</v>

3
00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.680
<v Speaker 1>you used to be the host of or one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>cohosts of citizen radio,</v>

4
00:00:20.681 --> 00:00:25.681
<v Speaker 1>like Super Progressive Lefty podcast and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were a Vegan,</v>

5
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:28.970
<v Speaker 1>but I ate a steak.</v>

6
00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:30.760
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hell's broken loose.</v>

7
00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:32.530
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what's happening.</v>

8
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:33.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't know where I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

9
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.840
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember I was thinking about like </v>

10
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.750
<v Speaker 2>being back in the studio and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never met Jamie before and I was like,</v>

11
00:00:40.751 --> 00:00:42.220
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone's been really nice to me.</v>

12
00:00:42.221 --> 00:00:44.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm like literally feel like I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this isn't,</v>

13
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.920
<v Speaker 2>this isn't a trick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe sent me very nice emails and I'm </v>

14
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:49.920
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm a very trickle guy.</v>

15
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.790
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I came in and yeah,</v>

16
00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.660
<v Speaker 2>everyone's just lovely and nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

17
00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.160
<v Speaker 2>yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of change.</v>

18
00:00:57.161 --> 00:00:59.560
<v Speaker 2>I went into hiding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hiding</v>

19
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.940
<v Speaker 1>because I only got like a peripheral </v>
<v Speaker 1>story of like what?</v>

20
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.690
<v Speaker 1>What went sideways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

21
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:07.180
<v Speaker 1>So like some people girls accused you.</v>

22
00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.810
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

00:01:07.811 --> 00:01:08.800
<v Speaker 2>that this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

24
00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.720
<v Speaker 2>this is the fucking worst time for me to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be like,</v>

25
00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.750
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that everyone's talking about </v>

26
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:15.750
<v Speaker 2>Weinstein's time for Kilstein to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>his return,</v>

27
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.210
<v Speaker 2>why too simple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like roads.</v>

28
00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like very,</v>

29
00:01:19.211 --> 00:01:21.640
<v Speaker 2>like Julie and predatory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I wrote,</v>

30
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.880
<v Speaker 2>I wrote Stan Hope I get a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When the wine,</v>

31
00:01:24.881 --> 00:01:25.690
<v Speaker 2>same thing happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

32
00:01:25.691 --> 00:01:27.220
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to like push off this return?</v>

33
00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.850
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're fine.</v>

34
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.070
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

35
00:01:30.071 --> 00:01:31.540
<v Speaker 2>So here's what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

36
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.970
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it kind of started where I was a comic a</v>

37
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.840
<v Speaker 2>for years and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as it got more progressive,</v>

38
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:39.590
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

39
00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.990
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

40
00:01:39.991 --> 00:01:44.991
<v Speaker 2>it got more into that judgmental </v>
<v Speaker 2>territory I guess where I feel like I </v>

41
00:01:45.941 --> 00:01:49.750
<v Speaker 2>definitely became one of those people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who would just be on twitter all day and</v>

42
00:01:49.751 --> 00:01:52.000
<v Speaker 2>instead of sort of talking about real </v>
<v Speaker 2>issues,</v>

43
00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.070
<v Speaker 2>it just becomes like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are we mad at that day?</v>

44
00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.170
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who used the wrong word that day?</v>

45
00:01:56.171 --> 00:02:01.171
<v Speaker 2>Who can we get fired that day?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's twitter mob stuff and it </v>

46
00:02:01.171 --> 00:02:01.171
<v Speaker 2>happens on the right and it happens on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the left.</v>

47
00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.180
<v Speaker 2>And it's just like kind of just people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who were sad who just live like in the </v>

48
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.180
<v Speaker 2>box,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I was like one of them.</v>

49
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.400
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fine.</v>

50
00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.440
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this is such an important </v>

51
00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.440
<v Speaker 1>conversation because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you've kind of stepped away from</v>

52
00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.941
<v Speaker 1>it and you see it for what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people don't realize that when </v>

53
00:02:15.941 --> 00:02:16.970
<v Speaker 1>they're caught up in the swirl of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the momentum of it,</v>

54
00:02:16.971 --> 00:02:19.400
<v Speaker 1>that it's almost like a natural human </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior pattern.</v>

55
00:02:19.401 --> 00:02:20.300
<v Speaker 1>It's very tribal.</v>

56
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it's tribal and it's physically </v>

57
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:26.130
<v Speaker 2>addictive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

58
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I've like gone back and forth with </v>

59
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.150
<v Speaker 2>like drinking and not drinking a pot and</v>
<v Speaker 2>not smoking pot.</v>

60
00:02:33.151 --> 00:02:36.000
<v Speaker 2>And I can tell you that the thing I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>addicted to the most was twitter.</v>

61
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.740
<v Speaker 2>It was refreshing twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

62
00:02:37.741 --> 00:02:40.130
<v Speaker 2>you literally get dopamine hits from </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

63
00:02:40.131 --> 00:02:43.890
<v Speaker 2>Like I remember when I first tried to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get off twitter,</v>

64
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.160
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was fighting with some fucking </v>

65
00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.160
<v Speaker 2>stranger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

66
00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.530
<v Speaker 2>in my living room on twitter and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

67
00:02:49.531 --> 00:02:50.230
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck this.</v>

68
00:02:50.231 --> 00:02:52.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go take a walk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't need a,</v>

69
00:02:52.471 --> 00:02:53.760
<v Speaker 2>I don't need to be involved in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy's life.</v>

70
00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.120
<v Speaker 2>I closed it and before I even knew it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like walking in the park,</v>

71
00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 2>fighting with some other guy on my </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking phone and I'm like,</v>

72
00:02:59.981 --> 00:03:03.280
<v Speaker 2>it follows you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if someone's calling you a cunt,</v>

73
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.530
<v Speaker 2>they're calling you a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a dinner with your girlfriend,</v>

74
00:03:05.531 --> 00:03:10.531
<v Speaker 2>they're calling you a con when you go to</v>
<v Speaker 2>like your brother's graduation and </v>

75
00:03:10.531 --> 00:03:10.531
<v Speaker 2>you're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>refreshing it,</v>

76
00:03:10.531 --> 00:03:12.850
<v Speaker 2>waiting for someone to tell you that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're good.</v>

77
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:18.240
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and sort of so that I got addicted to </v>

78
00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.240
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

79
00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.760
<v Speaker 2>more than anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And especially when I finally got an </v>

80
00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.870
<v Speaker 2>audience with the left have left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

81
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:27.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just to be very clear,</v>

82
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like I'm going to come on this </v>

83
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.000

<v Speaker 2>I'm Johnny Rape Joke.</v>

85
00:03:34.481 --> 00:03:38.860
<v Speaker 2>Those fucking bitches all had to come </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're just being a person.</v>

86
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:44.010
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's what I like wasn't doing for </v>

87
00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:44.290
<v Speaker 2>a very long time is I feel like I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to speak for people,</v>

88
00:03:44.291 --> 00:03:47.650
<v Speaker 2>but I feel like with me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always needed something to like define</v>

89
00:03:47.651 --> 00:03:48.880
<v Speaker 2>me right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where it's like,</v>

90
00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm a progressive or I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a Vegan or I'm just Jujitsu and </v>

91
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.630
<v Speaker 2>whatever I whatever I would become kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of currently obsessed with.</v>

92
00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.860
<v Speaker 2>I was sort of like throw the other shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>away and kind of like shit all over that</v>

93
00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.620
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

94
00:04:02.621 --> 00:04:05.260
<v Speaker 2>a lot of times I would feel like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>failure.</v>

95
00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.020
<v Speaker 2>Like that's really where the </v>
<v Speaker 2>progressive.</v>

96
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.360
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I still hold a lot of progressive</v>

97
00:04:10.361 --> 00:04:13.730
<v Speaker 2>ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's when I went from comic to the</v>

98
00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:18.770
<v Speaker 2>political.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't that I like wanted to make </v>

99
00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:19.300
<v Speaker 2>comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

101
00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.310

<v Speaker 2>I feel like I've failed.</v>

102
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:25.540
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

103
00:04:25.541 --> 00:04:30.541
<v Speaker 2>I dropped out of school to start a </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy like 17 and I did the things </v>

104
00:04:30.761 --> 00:04:32.860
<v Speaker 2>you're supposed to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

105
00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:37.890
<v Speaker 2>and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did Montreal a couple of times and </v>

106
00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.890
<v Speaker 2>Conan once,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

107
00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.060
<v Speaker 2>and I had this year where it seemed like</v>
<v Speaker 2>things were gonna happen and then,</v>

108
00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:45.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was kind of that guy that people were </v>

109
00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.450
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.251
<v Speaker 2>we like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can't do anything with you but we </v>

111
00:04:47.251 --> 00:04:49.111
<v Speaker 2>like you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I started to kind of make my own </v>

112
00:04:49.111 --> 00:04:49.111
<v Speaker 2>audience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the audience was fucking great.</v>

113
00:04:49.111 --> 00:04:51.010
<v Speaker 2>It was like a bunch of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

114
00:04:51.011 --> 00:04:53.740
<v Speaker 2>when that show started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a bunch of just weird.</v>

115
00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:59.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm sweet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nerdy comedy fans and then everything </v>

116
00:04:59.201 --> 00:05:03.550
<v Speaker 2>just started getting pushed a to two </v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy though.</v>

117
00:05:03.551 --> 00:05:08.551
<v Speaker 2>Like when I knew shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said this on Doug's podcast when I </v>

00:05:20.111 --> 00:05:23.420
<v Speaker 2>we appreciate you using a defending </v>
<v Speaker 2>trans people.</v>

123
00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.650
<v Speaker 2>The word idiot is able list and I want </v>
<v Speaker 2>it to be like,</v>

124
00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:28.840
<v Speaker 2>you're retarded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your retarded context.</v>

125
00:05:28.841 --> 00:05:28.950
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

126
00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:34.060
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to list for people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people making fun of people who don't </v>

127
00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.480
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it means anymore.</v>

128
00:05:35.481 --> 00:05:38.480
<v Speaker 1>I thought abelist was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy's in a wheelchair.</v>

129
00:05:38.481 --> 00:05:43.481
<v Speaker 1>Fuck him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I guess like all of these different </v>

130
00:05:43.481 --> 00:05:43.481
<v Speaker 1>terms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these everyday terms,</v>

131
00:05:43.481 --> 00:05:46.040
<v Speaker 1>like I guess idiot is abelist because </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking,</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's a bliss.</v>

135
00:05:49.591 --> 00:05:52.520
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're not an idiot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if your brain works well,</v>

136
00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:54.800
<v Speaker 1>you're mocking someone whose brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't work well.</v>

137
00:05:54.801 --> 00:05:58.150
<v Speaker 1>They're not able to think correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're enabling Joe,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I know that.</v>

140
00:06:02.121 --> 00:06:07.121
<v Speaker 1>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I looked like a meathead and I espoused </v>

141
00:06:07.121 --> 00:06:09.140
<v Speaker 1>some right wing ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when it comes to like social issues,</v>

142
00:06:09.141 --> 00:06:10.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm very progressive.</v>

143
00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:15.520
<v Speaker 2>We became friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You saw a gay rights thing I did on </v>

144
00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:15.520
<v Speaker 2>twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

145
00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.390
<v Speaker 2>Like you weren't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I'm.</v>

146
00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:20.180
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I saw happening you,</v>

147
00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:24.140
<v Speaker 1>but what I saw happening with you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what I see happening just in general,</v>

148
00:06:24.141 --> 00:06:25.720
<v Speaker 1>online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

149
00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:30.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was on citizens radio when you guys </v>

150
00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:30.730
<v Speaker 1>first started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're on our poster.</v>

151
00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:34.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's something that happened </v>

152
00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:36.110
<v Speaker 1>where people were around the time of </v>
<v Speaker 1>occupy Wall Street.</v>

153
00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:41.170
<v Speaker 1>Things got really heated up and people </v>
<v Speaker 1>started moving way left and then some </v>

154
00:06:41.271 --> 00:06:42.860
<v Speaker 1>folks started moving way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

155
00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:47.861
<v Speaker 1>And I really truly believe to this day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way left is what started the whole </v>

156
00:06:47.861 --> 00:06:50.810
<v Speaker 1>trump movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in response to the way left.</v>

157
00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:55.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think all these shit heads got </v>

158
00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.310
<v Speaker 1>together and they didn't like being </v>
<v Speaker 1>accused of being assholes are able lists</v>

159
00:06:58.311 --> 00:07:01.160
<v Speaker 1>or rapist or whatever it is by the ultra</v>
<v Speaker 1>progressives.</v>

160
00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:06.400
<v Speaker 1>So they went far right and all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the alt right essentially was </v>

161
00:07:08.031 --> 00:07:12.020
<v Speaker 1>people who didn't identify with these </v>
<v Speaker 1>old men who were bankers,</v>

162
00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:17.320
<v Speaker 1>but they also didn't want to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything to do with these ultra lefty </v>

163
00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:18.980
<v Speaker 1>progressive that we're calling everyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>a racist.</v>

164
00:07:18.981 --> 00:07:21.410
<v Speaker 1>Everyone a rapist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every man's a piece of shit.</v>

165
00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:21.800
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

166
00:07:21.801 --> 00:07:22.970
<v Speaker 1>I did all of that.</v>

167
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:23.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I straight up that,</v>

168
00:07:23.961 --> 00:07:26.980
<v Speaker 2>all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think one of the things with the,</v>

169
00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.810
<v Speaker 2>the ultra left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe this is me,</v>

170
00:07:29.811 --> 00:07:30.850
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

171
00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:36.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe this is me desperately trying to </v>

172
00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:36.200
<v Speaker 2>defend myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think in a weird way it was harder</v>

173
00:07:36.201 --> 00:07:41.201
<v Speaker 2>for me and it's harder for a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people to see themselves slipping into </v>

174
00:07:41.201 --> 00:07:45.221
<v Speaker 2>the extreme left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so like what I mean by that is I </v>

175
00:07:45.221 --> 00:07:47.501
<v Speaker 2>never thought when I heard people say </v>
<v Speaker 2>the extreme right is as is as bad as the</v>

176
00:07:47.931 --> 00:07:49.370
<v Speaker 2>extreme left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was always like,</v>

177
00:07:49.371 --> 00:07:52.780
<v Speaker 2>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because like the extreme left isn't like</v>

178
00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:57.900
<v Speaker 2>the bombing Palestine being like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give us free healthcare or let Trans </v>

179
00:07:57.900 --> 00:07:57.950
<v Speaker 2>People Piss in the right bathroom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

180
00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:58.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

181
00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:00.300
<v Speaker 2>even that like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

182
00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:02.720
<v Speaker 2>the shooter and not in Vegas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that DC shooter,</v>

183
00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:05.890
<v Speaker 2>like he was like a fucking crazy guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't able to.</v>

184
00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:08.930
<v Speaker 2>So I'm sorry he wasn't shooting the </v>
<v Speaker 2>politician screaming like,</v>

185
00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:10.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he liked the Bernie Sanders page,</v>

186
00:08:10.941 --> 00:08:15.941
<v Speaker 2>but it wasn't like we are launching a </v>
<v Speaker 2>wars against Islam for a Christianity.</v>

187
00:08:17.271 --> 00:08:18.600
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

188
00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:20.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

189
00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:22.310
<v Speaker 2>what we're doing this for free market </v>
<v Speaker 2>capitalism.</v>

190
00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:27.340
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me the extreme left when I heard </v>

191
00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:30.551
<v Speaker 2>people say it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reason I would scoff when </v>

192
00:08:30.551 --> 00:08:30.551
<v Speaker 2>someone like you would say it is because</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

193
00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:32.390
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the left should just be like,</v>

194
00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:33.920
<v Speaker 2>stand for like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>equality.</v>

195
00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:37.730
<v Speaker 2>Everyone has the right to an education.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone has the right to not go fucking</v>

196
00:08:37.731 --> 00:08:38.910
<v Speaker 2>hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

<v Speaker 2>to have health insurance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gay.</v>

198
00:08:41.151 --> 00:08:45.350
<v Speaker 2>People can do whatever they want with </v>
<v Speaker 2>their dicks than vaginas.</v>

199
00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:46.860
<v Speaker 2>Vaginas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It shouldn't</v>

200
00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:50.080
<v Speaker 1>be essentially like that on both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The right what,</v>

201
00:08:50.081 --> 00:08:55.081
<v Speaker 1>what being a conservative used to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>with small government and having the </v>

202
00:08:56.191 --> 00:09:00.330
<v Speaker 1>government stay out of your lives and </v>
<v Speaker 1>morphing</v>

203
00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:02.870
<v Speaker 2>where it's like we will stay out of your</v>
<v Speaker 2>lives,</v>

204
00:09:02.871 --> 00:09:07.871
<v Speaker 2>but we will be like in your pussy if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>want a fucking abortion will tell you </v>

206
00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:10.140
<v Speaker 1>abortion thing is where it gets real </v>
<v Speaker 1>squirrely.</v>

207
00:09:10.141 --> 00:09:15.141
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the abortion thing is </v>

208
00:09:15.141 --> 00:09:16.420
<v Speaker 1>essentially it's a religious thing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a religious thing.</v>

209
00:09:16.421 --> 00:09:21.421
<v Speaker 1>It's and it's a moral thing and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also what is an abortion.</v>

210
00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:25.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean you are ending a life but you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>ending a life inside a woman's body.</v>

211
00:09:25.921 --> 00:09:27.180
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when is it okay to do that?</v>

212
00:09:27.181 --> 00:09:28.140
<v Speaker 1>Is it okay to do that</v>

213
00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:33.820
<v Speaker 1>one day and as the grown woman's life </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter more than the cells are more than</v>

214
00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.050
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

215
00:09:35.051 --> 00:09:40.051
<v Speaker 1>That gets to a point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but initially it's like when is it </v>

216
00:09:40.051 --> 00:09:40.051
<v Speaker 1>defined as a life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if,</v>

217
00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:42.580
<v Speaker 1>if the moment of conception,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that moment,</v>

218
00:09:42.581 --> 00:09:44.880
<v Speaker 1>if 30 seconds later it's an abortion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

219
00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:47.920
<v Speaker 1>Like if you could hold your breath and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then the baby's dead.</v>

220
00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:53.190
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if we found out that the moment </v>

221
00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:55.261
<v Speaker 1>that God comes in a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if she could just hold her breath for a </v>

222
00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:55.261
<v Speaker 1>minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

223
00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:57.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why does that sound worried be murdered?</v>

224
00:09:57.890 --> 00:09:58.690
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it is.</v>

225
00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.970

226
00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:06.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm pro choice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but abortion is weird because like when </v>

227
00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:07.180
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it gets older,</v>

228
00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:09.640
<v Speaker 1>when you're four weeks in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six weeks in,</v>

229
00:10:09.641 --> 00:10:12.490
<v Speaker 1>it's still illegal and it's a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>little baby.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean it is a little baby look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

231

<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they have a heartbeat.</v>

233
00:10:18.521 --> 00:10:21.130
<v Speaker 1>If it gets to a certain age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on?</v>

234
00:10:21.131 --> 00:10:26.131
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm not saying that it should be my</v>
<v Speaker 1>choice to define whether or not someone </v>

235
00:10:26.131 --> 00:10:30.421
<v Speaker 1>should do it or not do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's very disingenuous when people </v>

236
00:10:30.421 --> 00:10:31.870
<v Speaker 1>frame this argument as it's a woman's </v>
<v Speaker 1>right to choose period.</v>

237
00:10:31.871 --> 00:10:34.060
<v Speaker 1>And that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just that.</v>

238
00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:35.590
<v Speaker 1>It's also killing a baby.</v>

239
00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:36.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

240
00:10:36.161 --> 00:10:37.590
<v Speaker 2>Feminists don't like me anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm like,</v>

241
00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:39.250
<v Speaker 2>coat hanger up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm out of this debate.</v>

242
00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:40.300
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a shit.</v>

243
00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:41.530
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a.</v>

244
00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:46.760
<v Speaker 1>It should be an honest debate because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a very controversial and very nuanced</v>

245
00:10:46.831 --> 00:10:49.410
<v Speaker 1>issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's not as simple as,</v>

246
00:10:49.411 --> 00:10:52.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right doesn't want a woman to choose</v>

247
00:10:52.351 --> 00:10:55.440
<v Speaker 1>and stay out of my body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just stay out of your body.</v>

248
00:10:55.441 --> 00:10:56.580
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are we doing?</v>

249
00:10:56.581 --> 00:10:58.950
<v Speaker 1>We're killing a baby that's in a woman's</v>
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>

250
00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:00.510
<v Speaker 1>At what age should that be legal?</v>

251
00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:05.530
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think that's the whole thing that </v>

252
00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:05.530
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about before with these </v>
<v Speaker 2>echo chambers where,</v>

253
00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:10.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the first time ever I've been </v>

254
00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:12.680
<v Speaker 2>listening to sort of like both sides of </v>
<v Speaker 2>issues.</v>

255
00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:16.730
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first time ever since recently.</v>

256
00:11:16.731 --> 00:11:17.320
<v Speaker 2>Yay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

257
00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:18.950
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because like you just see again,</v>

258
00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:21.320
<v Speaker 2>the majority of people like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

259
00:11:21.321 --> 00:11:22.670
<v Speaker 2>I'll totally fess up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

260
00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:27.820
<v Speaker 2>Like I didn't ask a lot of follow up </v>
<v Speaker 2>questions because your facebook feed is </v>

261
00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:31.361
<v Speaker 2>curated and your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your twitter is all of your friends and </v>

262
00:11:31.361 --> 00:11:32.000
<v Speaker 2>for the most part people you agree with </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

263
00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:37.060
<v Speaker 2>comedy was actually comedy now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I've been listening to like a ton </v>

264
00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:39.220
<v Speaker 2>of like backlogs of your show is because</v>
<v Speaker 2>once I was just like,</v>

265
00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:39.710
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't hit me.</v>

266
00:11:39.711 --> 00:11:40.910
<v Speaker 2>I can listen to the show again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>

267
00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:41.960
<v Speaker 2>Hated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

268
00:11:41.961 --> 00:11:43.700
<v Speaker 2>I know I never hated it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

269
00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:48.760
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I started listening to the show and </v>

270
00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:49.280
<v Speaker 2>like hearing pretty equal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

271
00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:54.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>progressive to conservative ideals and </v>

272
00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:58.110
<v Speaker 2>comedy was always kind of this cool </v>
<v Speaker 2>place where you could explore ideas </v>

273
00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:01.300
<v Speaker 2>because comedy and jokes and laughter </v>
<v Speaker 2>would sort of take the,</v>

274
00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:03.820
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take the edge off a little bit,</v>

275
00:12:03.821 --> 00:12:04.600
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

276
00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:09.600
<v Speaker 2>And you could actually talk about issues</v>
<v Speaker 2>and once I kind of became part of that </v>

277
00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:13.750
<v Speaker 2>crew that would um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even shit on comedy than it was like,</v>

278
00:12:13.751 --> 00:12:18.751
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can watch democracy now and I guess </v>

279
00:12:18.751 --> 00:12:18.751
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

280
00:12:18.751 --> 00:12:20.470
<v Speaker 2>and I have my.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I would feel fucking stupid.</v>

281
00:12:20.471 --> 00:12:22.360
<v Speaker 2>I hung out with journalists and hang out</v>
<v Speaker 2>with comics.</v>

282
00:12:22.361 --> 00:12:24.370
<v Speaker 2>I hung out with people where I was sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of like,</v>

283
00:12:24.371 --> 00:12:26.800
<v Speaker 2>felt like the joke monkey and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

284
00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:30.280
<v Speaker 2>the high school dropout part of me would</v>
<v Speaker 2>get really like.</v>

285
00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:35.310
<v Speaker 1>But you felt like the job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you feel like you had to be funny </v>

286
00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:35.310
<v Speaker 1>when you're around those pieces?</v>

287
00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:40.320
<v Speaker 2>Because when I tried to say something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like political or that I thought was </v>

288
00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:41.150
<v Speaker 2>smart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would just be kind of like a,</v>

289
00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:44.440
<v Speaker 2>a hushed because I'm not that smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

290
00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:47.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm good at telling stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

291
00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:49.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm good at like,</v>

292
00:12:49.511 --> 00:12:52.960
<v Speaker 2>I think listening and asking like decent</v>
<v Speaker 2>questions.</v>

293
00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:58.050
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was never like a fucking </v>

294
00:12:58.050 --> 00:12:58.050
<v Speaker 2>intellectual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

295
00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:00.070
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of that crowd is um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's good.</v>

296
00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:01.510
<v Speaker 2>We need those people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

297
00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:04.150
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I would,</v>

298
00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:05.440
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

299
00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:09.100
<v Speaker 2>it was really easy for me to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just shut up,</v>

300
00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:09.640
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

301
00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:11.430
<v Speaker 1>Is this all in your mind?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

302
00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:12.720
<v Speaker 1>you're a human being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

303
00:13:12.721 --> 00:13:14.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're just talking to these people,</v>

304
00:13:14.311 --> 00:13:16.260
<v Speaker 1>you're not an unintelligent person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

305
00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:21.440
<v Speaker 1>Is this just an insecurity that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>carried around with you when you were </v>

306
00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:21.440
<v Speaker 1>around the whole lay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

307
00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:22.790
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of it was the reason why I asked you</v>

308
00:13:22.791 --> 00:13:27.791
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your show was sort of in a lot of ways </v>

309
00:13:27.791 --> 00:13:27.791
<v Speaker 1>of entering into the world of </v>
<v Speaker 1>journalism.</v>

310
00:13:27.791 --> 00:13:27.791
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's right.</v>

311
00:13:27.791 --> 00:13:28.790
<v Speaker 2>It's going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

312
00:13:28.791 --> 00:13:30.740
<v Speaker 2>That's where I was going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like sort of way back,</v>

313
00:13:30.770 --> 00:13:32.270
<v Speaker 2>which was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

314
00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:34.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the show,</v>

315
00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:40.420
<v Speaker 2>a show started as a comedy show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was called drunk and politics before </v>

316
00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:42.050
<v Speaker 2>it was called citizen radio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

317
00:13:42.051 --> 00:13:44.690
<v Speaker 2>I think we changed it maybe around like </v>
<v Speaker 2>occupy,</v>

318
00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:50.170
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was comedy and like we had </v>

319
00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:50.170
<v Speaker 2>progressive ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's sort of what we talked about,</v>

320
00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:54.731
<v Speaker 2>but it wasn't that we had to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it became this thing where any </v>

321
00:13:54.731 --> 00:13:56.520
<v Speaker 2>progressive issue in the news that day </v>
<v Speaker 2>or on twitter we had to,</v>

322
00:13:56.990 --> 00:14:01.990
<v Speaker 2>we had to talk about that day and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of lost.</v>

323
00:14:02.391 --> 00:14:02.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

324
00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:05.360
<v Speaker 1>Did you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did it also interrupt interrupting here,</v>

325
00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:06.880
<v Speaker 1>but did it also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

326
00:14:06.881 --> 00:14:09.660
<v Speaker 1>you guys went to is sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>subscription service?</v>

327
00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:11.700
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we actually,</v>

328
00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:12.570
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

329
00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:12.690
<v Speaker 1>that</v>

330
00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:17.780
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm really proud of about that </v>
<v Speaker 2>show and why I'm definitely bummed out.</v>

331
00:14:18.241 --> 00:14:19.300
<v Speaker 2>I lost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

332
00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:21.750
<v Speaker 2>a lot of those fans are or whatever was </v>
<v Speaker 2>we.</v>

333
00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:23.940
<v Speaker 2>We started ages ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

334
00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:29.010
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were pretty early on with podcasts </v>

335
00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:29.580
<v Speaker 2>and we never had commercials and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>never had.</v>

336
00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:31.590
<v Speaker 2>You didn't really get anything if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>paid.</v>

337
00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:36.620
<v Speaker 2>It was voluntary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like a shitty version of NPR </v>

338
00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:37.080
<v Speaker 2>where it was like everybody gets to show</v>
<v Speaker 2>for free.</v>

339
00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:42.140
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like I was trying to be </v>

340
00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:43.340
<v Speaker 2>socialist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone gets to show for free if you </v>

341
00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:43.340
<v Speaker 2>can't afford $5 a month,</v>
<v Speaker 2>$10 a month,</v>

342
00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:44.210
<v Speaker 2>$50.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People do that way.</v>

343
00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:46.050
<v Speaker 2>Sam Harris does that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>

344
00:14:46.051 --> 00:14:46.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

345
00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:47.590
<v Speaker 2>We just didn't really have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

346
00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:49.530
<v Speaker 2>we couldn't afford to send you like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>tote bag or whatever,</v>

347
00:14:49.531 --> 00:14:50.760
<v Speaker 2>but yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it wasn't a pay model.</v>

348
00:14:50.761 --> 00:14:52.010
<v Speaker 2>Everything said anybody could</v>

349
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:52.880
<v Speaker 1>hear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

350
00:14:52.881 --> 00:14:57.881
<v Speaker 1>we occasionally did like little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like goofy bonus shows for like </v>

351
00:14:57.881 --> 00:14:57.881
<v Speaker 1>subscribers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that was it.</v>

352
00:14:57.881 --> 00:15:00.140
<v Speaker 1>That was the question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there was some shows that only people</v>

353
00:15:00.141 --> 00:15:03.220
<v Speaker 1>who subscribed because not a lot though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

354
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:05.210
<v Speaker 1>And it was five days a week too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was a lot.</v>

355
00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:07.700
<v Speaker 1>That's another thing when you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fucking show five days a week,</v>

356
00:15:07.701 --> 00:15:10.330
<v Speaker 1>you got to dig for things to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pissed off about a.</v>

357
00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:11.990
<v Speaker 1>to not be redundant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

358
00:15:11.991 --> 00:15:16.190
<v Speaker 1>I've done five days a week shows and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I'm at my best five days a</v>

359
00:15:16.191 --> 00:15:21.191
<v Speaker 1>week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think four days a week is where I </v>

360
00:15:21.191 --> 00:15:23.650
<v Speaker 1>start to break down anything after four </v>
<v Speaker 1>days a week unless I'm doing like fight </v>

361
00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:27.851
<v Speaker 1>companions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are just a goof that's just </v>

362
00:15:27.851 --> 00:15:27.851
<v Speaker 1>hanging out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching fights.</v>

363
00:15:27.851 --> 00:15:27.851
<v Speaker 1>That's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

364
00:15:27.851 --> 00:15:32.830
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to get stale board.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to force it into being a </v>

365
00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:32.830
<v Speaker 1>job.</v>

366
00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:36.850
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what I got out of you was that </v>

367
00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:39.160
<v Speaker 1>you or you were getting a lot of praise </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you were.</v>

368
00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:44.390
<v Speaker 1>You were being hailed like I saw Jessica</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bell wrote something where they called </v>

369
00:15:44.781 --> 00:15:48.920
<v Speaker 1>you a great example of an ally or that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was pre this year.</v>

370
00:15:48.921 --> 00:15:50.160
<v Speaker 1>He has a bell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

371
00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:52.340
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that expression was a.</v>

372
00:15:52.341 --> 00:15:53.990
<v Speaker 1>is a very odd expression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

373
00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:58.550
<v Speaker 1>I hate to sound like this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>disingenuous egalitarianism,</v>

374
00:15:58.551 --> 00:16:00.330
<v Speaker 1>but I really do believe this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we.</v>

375
00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:05.440
<v Speaker 1>We should be allies to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all should be this idea that like </v>

376
00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:09.641
<v Speaker 1>there's a God team war going on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie Kilstein is out there booking for </v>

377
00:16:09.641 --> 00:16:11.000
<v Speaker 1>the females.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it's like.</v>

378
00:16:11.001 --> 00:16:13.940
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's what they input.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They reward that.</v>

379
00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:16.300
<v Speaker 1>This is the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like some,</v>

380
00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:21.330
<v Speaker 1>and this is not the single outage as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well because I think they've got some </v>

381
00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:21.330
<v Speaker 1>great writers.</v>

382
00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:25.040
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something that happens with </v>

383
00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:27.761
<v Speaker 1>people when you write a lot of mean a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very critical stuff and you you become </v>

384
00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:36.790
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this attack machine and this is how you </v>

385
00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:40.720
<v Speaker 1>promote your ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is how you push your agenda by </v>

386
00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:42.110
<v Speaker 1>attacking people that some of them </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking deserve it for sure.</v>

387
00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:47.230
<v Speaker 1>Some of them we're definitely assholes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it becomes almost like the currency </v>

388
00:16:48.141 --> 00:16:49.400
<v Speaker 1>that you're dealing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

389
00:16:49.401 --> 00:16:51.080
<v Speaker 1>and that goes back to the insecurity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

390
00:16:51.081 --> 00:16:52.060
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

391
00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:57.330
<v Speaker 1>but let me finish sentence is that when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're an attack machine like that,</v>

392
00:16:58.131 --> 00:17:03.131
<v Speaker 1>and not saying that Jezza bill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of the blogs that are </v>

393
00:17:03.131 --> 00:17:05.951
<v Speaker 1>attack machines when you're attacked </v>
<v Speaker 1>machine and if you can be an ally on the</v>

394
00:17:07.671 --> 00:17:09.260
<v Speaker 1>other side are not even on the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>side,</v>

395
00:17:09.261 --> 00:17:11.900
<v Speaker 1>but an ally to the attack machine like </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they single you out,</v>

396
00:17:11.901 --> 00:17:14.060
<v Speaker 1>is that it gives you this feeling like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

397
00:17:14.061 --> 00:17:15.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to get attacked by them.</v>

398
00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:20.800
<v Speaker 1>This is good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you reinforce that behavior by </v>

399
00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:23.861
<v Speaker 1>ramping up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The types of things that you say that </v>

400
00:17:23.861 --> 00:17:25.280
<v Speaker 1>they like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they appreciate and it becomes a sort of</v>

401
00:17:25.281 --> 00:17:30.281
<v Speaker 1>weird exchange where you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like imply like I think this is </v>

402
00:17:30.281 --> 00:17:32.780
<v Speaker 1>what a lot of what goes on and political</v>
<v Speaker 1>circles as well.</v>

403
00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:37.810
<v Speaker 1>Like there's not as much bribery as </v>
<v Speaker 1>there is an understanding that if you do</v>

404
00:17:37.941 --> 00:17:40.610
<v Speaker 1>what we want you to do and you say what </v>
<v Speaker 1>we want you to do,</v>

405
00:17:40.611 --> 00:17:42.770
<v Speaker 1>then you're in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're on the good side.</v>

406
00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:47.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that goes back to that insecurity </v>

407
00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:49.130
<v Speaker 1>and I think a lot of people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>insecure.</v>

408
00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:49.980
<v Speaker 1>I think we're all</v>

409
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:51.330
<v Speaker 2>insecure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone is.</v>

410
00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:53.460
<v Speaker 2>And when you do find that tribe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

411
00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:55.860
<v Speaker 2>And you do find people who are going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

412
00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:59.070
<v Speaker 2>And the more you attack on twitter </v>
<v Speaker 2>because not just blogs,</v>

413
00:17:59.071 --> 00:18:00.660
<v Speaker 2>like remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like individuals on twitter,</v>

414
00:18:00.661 --> 00:18:03.210
<v Speaker 2>like me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when I would see like who's getting</v>

415
00:18:03.211 --> 00:18:05.250
<v Speaker 2>piled on today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

416
00:18:05.251 --> 00:18:10.251
<v Speaker 2>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This writer wrote something about </v>

417
00:18:10.251 --> 00:18:10.251
<v Speaker 2>mansplaning don't need to read the </v>
<v Speaker 2>article.</v>

418
00:18:10.251 --> 00:18:11.220
<v Speaker 2>What's the Hashtag?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the Hashtag.</v>

419
00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:16.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to say the fucking meanest </v>
<v Speaker 2>funny thing because I'm a comic and I'm </v>

420
00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:18.840
<v Speaker 2>funnier than journalists and then a </v>
<v Speaker 2>famous people are going to retweet me or</v>

421
00:18:18.841 --> 00:18:22.920
<v Speaker 2>phase me and then I get to feel like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking civil rights hero because that's</v>

422

<v Speaker 2>even if I tweeted somebody's sincere and</v>

424
00:18:28.621 --> 00:18:33.621
<v Speaker 2>this like sucks to admit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but even if I tweeted something like </v>

425
00:18:33.621 --> 00:18:36.380
<v Speaker 2>Hashtag black lives matter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm refreshing that shit to be like to </v>

00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:38.280
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm not doing it to be,</v>

428
00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:43.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you can feel good about </v>

429

430
00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:43.430
<v Speaker 2>Not Saying I did this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can go on the street and you can</v>

431
00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:48.141
<v Speaker 2>fucking ignore the homeless person and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can cross the street when you see </v>

432
00:18:48.141 --> 00:18:48.141
<v Speaker 2>like the scary black guy because you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>

433
00:18:48.141 --> 00:18:52.701
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm technically the Rosa Parks of </v>

434
00:18:52.701 --> 00:18:54.441
<v Speaker 2>twitter because I fucking tweeted that </v>
<v Speaker 2>joke at that writer who said that </v>

435
00:18:54.441 --> 00:18:54.900
<v Speaker 2>fucking thing that no one's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>remember tomorrow,</v>

436
00:18:54.901 --> 00:18:58.260
<v Speaker 2>but we were all angry about today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

437
00:18:58.290 --> 00:18:59.740
<v Speaker 2>This is the first time I've had caveman </v>
<v Speaker 2>coffee.</v>

438
00:19:00.170 --> 00:19:01.600
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's Nitros are no joke,</v>

439
00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:06.260
<v Speaker 1>drinking adderall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I've ever done adderall.</v>

440
00:19:06.261 --> 00:19:06.420
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

441
00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:11.740
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got adderall offered to me before the </v>

442
00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:14.671
<v Speaker 2>Stan hope podcast and he came up to me </v>
<v Speaker 2>afterwards and was like,</v>

443
00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:16.610
<v Speaker 2>ah man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you fucking talked a lot.</v>

444
00:19:16.611 --> 00:19:17.990
<v Speaker 2>That adderall fucked you up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

445
00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:20.300
<v Speaker 2>I didn't take it like I had it in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>pocket.</v>

446
00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:22.430
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was just me being spazzy.</v>

447
00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:25.970
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I think what happens is,</v>

448
00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.480
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you get that validation</v>

449
00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:33.470
<v Speaker 1>validation and it's essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an exchange and it was an exchange </v>

450
00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:35.100
<v Speaker 1>that you're talking about with twitter </v>
<v Speaker 1>being like this.</v>

451
00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:37.960
<v Speaker 1>You get this dopamine rush every time </v>
<v Speaker 1>you tweet and refresh.</v>

452
00:19:37.961 --> 00:19:42.961
<v Speaker 1>And it's one of the main reasons why I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't interact with people online very </v>

453
00:19:42.961 --> 00:19:43.890
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very rare that I do.</v>

454
00:19:43.891 --> 00:19:45.900
<v Speaker 1>And when I do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm almost always civil.</v>

455
00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:50.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I just don't think that unless </v>

456
00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:53.411
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of my friends called Berta fucking </v>

457
00:19:53.411 --> 00:19:53.411
<v Speaker 1>door because he called himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The machine is like,</v>

458
00:19:53.411 --> 00:19:54.960
<v Speaker 1>come on dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the machine.</v>

459
00:19:54.961 --> 00:19:58.230
<v Speaker 1>Like I love him so much years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let that go.</v>

460
00:19:58.250 --> 00:19:59.340
<v Speaker 1>Bird got to move on.</v>

461
00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:01.990
<v Speaker 2>I uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean that's just fake.</v>

462
00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:02.590
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

463
00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:04.390
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

464
00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:10.170
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't gonna say off that with man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just a sort of sidebar with twitter when</v>

465

473
00:20:32.111 --> 00:20:32.111
<v Speaker 2>controversial issues,</v>

<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you were talking about where you're</v>

483
00:20:49.211 --> 00:20:49.960
<v Speaker 2>attack machine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I swear to God,</v>

485
00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:55.540
<v Speaker 2>I emailed it to myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can be like Brogan,</v>

488
00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:02.320
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>

489
00:21:02.321 --> 00:21:05.050
<v Speaker 2>so that happened and what you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying with the allied title,</v>

490
00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:09.210
<v Speaker 2>I was never comfortable with a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

491
00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:12.460
<v Speaker 2>the stuff I got thrown into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

492
00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:16.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was constantly saying either the wrong</v>

493
00:21:16.691 --> 00:21:21.691
<v Speaker 2>or offensive things on the show that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>would have to do to try and be funny </v>

494
00:21:21.691 --> 00:21:24.960
<v Speaker 2>because I'm trying to be funny and we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to have to stop and edit it out </v>

495
00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:26.740
<v Speaker 2>and I would feel like a fucking idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

496
00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:32.340
<v Speaker 2>and I remember I did a college once and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was the first time it's ever </v>

497
00:21:34.001 --> 00:21:34.420
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>

498
00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:35.770
<v Speaker 2>Like usually they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

499
00:21:35.771 --> 00:21:39.220
<v Speaker 2>they introduce you by my measly credits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they would be like,</v>

500
00:21:39.221 --> 00:21:44.221
<v Speaker 2>he did Conan once and this time the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the woman at the college introduced me.</v>

501
00:21:44.771 --> 00:21:47.640
<v Speaker 2>She didn't give any comedy credits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She just goes out.</v>

502
00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:52.650
<v Speaker 2>Our headliner tonight is a male feminist</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I remember going into the mic and </v>

503
00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:53.470
<v Speaker 2>being like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes me sound like a rapist.</v>

504
00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:58.500
<v Speaker 2>Like it sounds so fucking creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I was like labeling </v>

505
00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:02.701
<v Speaker 2>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a label that was thrown at me </v>

506
00:22:02.701 --> 00:22:02.701
<v Speaker 2>and in my head I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

507
00:22:02.701 --> 00:22:02.701
<v Speaker 2>I don't hate women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I guess.</v>

508
00:22:02.701 --> 00:22:03.210
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

509
00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:08.430
<v Speaker 2>but male feminists sounds like you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>like cruising around in like a fucking </v>

510
00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:09.010
<v Speaker 2>male feminist van being like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who wants equal pay?</v>

511
00:22:09.011 --> 00:22:11.890
<v Speaker 2>Like it sounds so creepy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

512
00:22:11.891 --> 00:22:16.891
<v Speaker 2>I took it because there is so much </v>
<v Speaker 2>sexism on the other side that you're </v>

513
00:22:16.891 --> 00:22:17.020
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess man,</v>

514
00:22:17.021 --> 00:22:18.580
<v Speaker 2>I guess being an ally is good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

515
00:22:18.581 --> 00:22:23.581
<v Speaker 2>That's like you're defending people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then it gets to this level where </v>

516
00:22:23.581 --> 00:22:27.001
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to renew my ally dues and call </v>

517
00:22:27.001 --> 00:22:27.570
<v Speaker 2>somebody a fucking rapist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

518
00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:28.720
<v Speaker 2>and that's where it got stuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

519
00:22:28.721 --> 00:22:30.520
<v Speaker 2>And then this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this is where it bit me in the ass.</v>

520
00:22:30.550 --> 00:22:35.550
<v Speaker 2>So I come on this show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have the argument about a sexism </v>

521
00:22:36.850 --> 00:22:37.340
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

522
00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:38.260
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had,</v>

523
00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:43.350
<v Speaker 1>we had a discussion about Daniel Tosh </v>
<v Speaker 1>rape jokes when Daniel Tosh made a rape </v>

524
00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:43.670
<v Speaker 1>jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

525
00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:49.180
<v Speaker 1>and also there was this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this weird definition that people like </v>

526
00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:53.291
<v Speaker 1>to use in a term.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you're probably aware of the </v>

527
00:22:53.291 --> 00:22:53.840
<v Speaker 1>actual definition now of like how many </v>
<v Speaker 1>rapes actually occur,</v>

528
00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:59.130
<v Speaker 1>which is it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It all came from a study that I want,</v>

529
00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:01.280
<v Speaker 1>if I want to say it was out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>University of Arizona,</v>

530
00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:06.520
<v Speaker 1>but I forget where the study was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they essentially looked at almost </v>

531
00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:09.440
<v Speaker 1>any uncomfortable interaction between a </v>
<v Speaker 1>man and a woman.</v>

532
00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:13.980
<v Speaker 1>Unwanted or remorseful sex was rape a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot,</v>

533
00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:17.240
<v Speaker 1>a lot of different things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sex while intoxicated was raped.</v>

534
00:23:17.241 --> 00:23:20.720
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of different things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they use to define sex where they got to</v>

535
00:23:20.721 --> 00:23:21.670
<v Speaker 1>this one and five.</v>

536
00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:26.710
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is another reason we need to </v>

537
00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:26.710
<v Speaker 2>have the conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

538
00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:28.160
<v Speaker 2>Because like I'm remorseful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what that definition is,</v>

539
00:23:28.161 --> 00:23:31.370
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't sound like many people </v>
<v Speaker 2>have had sex.</v>

540
00:23:31.371 --> 00:23:33.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you have in the afterwards like</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the.</v>

541
00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:38.650
<v Speaker 2>Some people want to call that rape,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like a,</v>

542
00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:41.390
<v Speaker 2>if you're a fucking blackout drunk and </v>
<v Speaker 2>like the dude's not like.</v>

543
00:23:41.410 --> 00:23:41.840
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

544
00:23:41.841 --> 00:23:46.841
<v Speaker 2>That is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if we can't have the conversation </v>

545
00:23:46.841 --> 00:23:46.841
<v Speaker 2>and the girl's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get raped.</v>

546
00:23:46.841 --> 00:23:47.930
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because that's happened to me.</v>

547
00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:49.100
<v Speaker 2>That's happened to me too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

548
00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:51.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm straight up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Has it grover hit you.</v>

549
00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:54.410
<v Speaker 2>Hit me physically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had girl swinging at me.</v>

550
00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:59.180
<v Speaker 2>I got the Telegraph it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do they wind up and,</v>

551
00:23:59.181 --> 00:24:00.740
<v Speaker 2>and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're yelling,</v>

552
00:24:00.741 --> 00:24:02.870
<v Speaker 2>which I've been told that's what they </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell you to do on Krav Maga.</v>

553
00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:08.100
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they yell while they do and I'm </v>

554
00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:08.100
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

555
00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:08.100
<v Speaker 2>you can't yell before you throw a punch.</v>

556
00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:08.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to come coming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

557
00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:09.980
<v Speaker 2>but these are stories that like I </v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't even tell it.</v>

558
00:24:09.981 --> 00:24:12.230
<v Speaker 2>Like I had a girlfriend tried to beat </v>
<v Speaker 2>the shit out of me,</v>

559
00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:14.000
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was,</v>

560
00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:17.060
<v Speaker 2>when I was like 20 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it happened at the same time.</v>

561
00:24:17.061 --> 00:24:22.061
<v Speaker 2>So I swear to God I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just dodging what happened but I </v>

562
00:24:22.061 --> 00:24:22.061
<v Speaker 2>will get through it after this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

563
00:24:22.061 --> 00:24:22.160
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

564
00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:25.760
<v Speaker 2>she was breaking up with her but it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the same time that,</v>

565
00:24:25.810 --> 00:24:27.260
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you remember dyphus?</v>

567

<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

569
00:24:33.111 --> 00:24:38.111

<v Speaker 2>but it was child services essentially </v>

570
00:24:38.111 --> 00:24:39.680
<v Speaker 2>was at our house to do like an </v>
<v Speaker 2>inspection essentially to be like,</v>

571
00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:42.740
<v Speaker 2>is it fit to have kids here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

572
00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:45.080

<v Speaker 2>baby?</v>

<v Speaker 2>We had like a alcoholism in the family </v>

578
00:24:54.101 --> 00:24:55.460
<v Speaker 2>and neighbors were complaining and </v>
<v Speaker 2>screaming and like I was a fucking train</v>

650
00:27:27.961 --> 00:27:30.840
<v Speaker 3>because the articles I read don't have </v>
<v Speaker 3>the nuanced parts,</v>

651
00:27:30.841 --> 00:27:31.170
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:33.960
<v Speaker 3>So all I explain what actually have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

653
00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:37.140
<v Speaker 3>Daniel Tosh was not supposed to be on </v>
<v Speaker 3>stage that night.</v>

654
00:27:37.141 --> 00:27:40.850
<v Speaker 3>Daniel Tosh was just hanging out at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>laugh factory and his good friend Dom,</v>

655
00:27:40.910 --> 00:27:43.710
<v Speaker 3>I asked him to go up and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll go,</v>

656
00:27:43.711 --> 00:27:45.150
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have any to talk about.</v>

657
00:27:45.151 --> 00:27:46.470
<v Speaker 3>He goes on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody goes crazy.</v>

658
00:27:46.471 --> 00:27:47.640
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Daniel Tosh is here.</v>

659
00:27:47.641 --> 00:27:49.350
<v Speaker 3>This is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>

660
00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:50.310
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>

661
00:27:50.311 --> 00:27:53.310
<v Speaker 3>I don't have any material,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not even supposed to be up here.</v>

662
00:27:53.311 --> 00:27:56.520
<v Speaker 3>So what do you guys want to talk about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What you know in some guy yells out.</v>

663
00:27:57.870 --> 00:27:58.890
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

664
00:27:58.891 --> 00:27:59.310
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

665
00:27:59.311 --> 00:28:00.760
<v Speaker 3>that's real funny sir.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

666
00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:05.800
<v Speaker 3>what's funny about rape?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The humiliation of violence and this </v>

667
00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:05.800
<v Speaker 3>woman yells out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually,</v>

668
00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:09.240
<v Speaker 3>nothing's funny about rape,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like very self aggrandizing.</v>

669
00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:10.800
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't be funny.</v>

670
00:28:10.801 --> 00:28:12.720
<v Speaker 3>And five guys raped her right now like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

671
00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:15.750
<v Speaker 3>That's the funny part is like what a </v>
<v Speaker 3>comedian does.</v>

672
00:28:15.751 --> 00:28:18.810
<v Speaker 3>So that line was the line that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>circulating.</v>

673
00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:23.960
<v Speaker 3>But even that first part,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not that that part was ignored </v>

674
00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:24.720
<v Speaker 3>conveniently,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole part where he's just like,</v>

675
00:28:24.721 --> 00:28:26.820
<v Speaker 3>what's funny about it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like that's a good.</v>

676
00:28:26.850 --> 00:28:29.070
<v Speaker 3>Technically that's an anti rape joke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

677
00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:30.870
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

678
00:28:30.871 --> 00:28:33.010
<v Speaker 3>Daniel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's how he thinks he's not,</v>

679
00:28:33.090 --> 00:28:35.180
<v Speaker 3>he's not a bad guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No sense the one,</v>

680
00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:40.350
<v Speaker 3>that's a great way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that has to do with these echo </v>

681
00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:40.350
<v Speaker 3>chambers where I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why don't fucking hear that part of it?</v>

682
00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:41.070
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just hear the part,</v>

683
00:28:41.071 --> 00:28:44.310
<v Speaker 3>you just hear the part that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>supposed to attack.</v>

684
00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:45.140
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

685
00:28:45.290 --> 00:28:47.700
<v Speaker 3>ironically I went to one of Burt's </v>
<v Speaker 3>podcasts,</v>

686
00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:49.270

<v Speaker 3>with that.</v>

<v Speaker 3>the spot.</v>

693

00:29:12.381 --> 00:29:13.080
<v Speaker 3>Because I don't want to blow up his </v>
<v Speaker 3>spot.</v>

699
00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:18.740
<v Speaker 3>But essentially what happened was they </v>
<v Speaker 3>stand hope it'll just get people to </v>

700
00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:19.080
<v Speaker 3>listen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>

701
00:29:19.850 --> 00:29:21.620
<v Speaker 3>Stan hope started,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

702
00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:26.010
<v Speaker 3>talking about a rape and child rape and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole show became very rape themed.</v>

703
00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:31.220
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there was a girl next to me and </v>

704
00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:33.170
<v Speaker 3>there was a woman next to me and my </v>
<v Speaker 3>girlfriend who just started screaming </v>

705
00:29:33.170 --> 00:29:34.630
<v Speaker 3>like Dell talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like I said,</v>

706
00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:36.840
<v Speaker 3>they ignored her the whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

707
00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:40.200
<v Speaker 3>and my girlfriend and I would look over </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then she would like have another sip</v>

708
00:29:40.201 --> 00:29:42.120
<v Speaker 3>of her drink and watch show and giggle </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then rape</v>

709
00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:43.130
<v Speaker 2>will come up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But she was like stopped.</v>

710
00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:44.830
<v Speaker 2>We just screamed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like she didn't,</v>

711
00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:46.030
<v Speaker 2>she didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she didn't,</v>

712
00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:48.250
<v Speaker 2>she didn't leave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like she didn't get up and leave.</v>

713
00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:53.580
<v Speaker 2>And that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was so interesting to be on sort of </v>

714
00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:54.010
<v Speaker 2>the opposite end of that where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

715
00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:56.470
<v Speaker 2>nothing offensive was really happening </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like,</v>

716
00:29:56.471 --> 00:29:57.070
<v Speaker 2>fuck man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

717
00:29:57.071 --> 00:29:59.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm next to that lady from the show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

718
00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:02.950
<v Speaker 2>this is like my Karmic fate and I'm just</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

719
00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:04.720
<v Speaker 2>she should go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she should leave.</v>

720
00:30:04.721 --> 00:30:07.590
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I was on the not calm,</v>

721
00:30:07.591 --> 00:30:10.570
<v Speaker 2>excited of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by then I wasn't doing comedy clubs,</v>

722
00:30:10.571 --> 00:30:12.670
<v Speaker 2>I was never really accepted into comedy </v>
<v Speaker 2>clubs.</v>

723
00:30:12.671 --> 00:30:14.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm just playing for my progressive </v>
<v Speaker 2>audience.</v>

724
00:30:14.461 --> 00:30:17.050
<v Speaker 2>Said like a Vegan coffee house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's,</v>

725
00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:22.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm just playing random,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like little rock gigs for like my </v>

726
00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:22.080
<v Speaker 2>audience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>

727
00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:22.080
<v Speaker 2>Echo Chamber,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

728
00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:24.010
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not hanging out with comics.</v>

729
00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:26.140
<v Speaker 2>So when people were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why aren't you defending a comment?</v>

730
00:30:26.141 --> 00:30:27.130
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know man,</v>

731
00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:29.000
<v Speaker 2>because I don't think I am one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I didn't,</v>

732
00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:31.090
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't really consider myself one.</v>

733
00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:33.700
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

734
00:30:33.970 --> 00:30:36.700
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So me and you a me and you went at it.</v>

735
00:30:36.701 --> 00:30:40.600
<v Speaker 2>I believe it was very divisive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think half your audience thought I was</v>

736
00:30:40.601 --> 00:30:42.430
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a whiny bitch and the other half thought</v>

737
00:30:42.431 --> 00:30:43.870
<v Speaker 2>I was a whiny bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should get raped.</v>

738
00:30:43.890 --> 00:30:45.160
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was very one sided.</v>

739
00:30:45.161 --> 00:30:47.430
<v Speaker 2>Nobody liked me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was uh,</v>

740
00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:52.420
<v Speaker 2>I did not come off well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm told and,</v>

741
00:30:53.010 --> 00:30:54.880
<v Speaker 2>but I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess I did the right thing,</v>

742
00:30:54.881 --> 00:30:59.881
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess I sided with women over over a </v>

743
00:30:59.881 --> 00:31:01.090
<v Speaker 2>jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so from then on,</v>

744
00:31:01.091 --> 00:31:04.500
<v Speaker 2>any comic that did like Mei didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

745
00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:06.230
<v Speaker 4>let me stop you right there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

746
00:31:07.630 --> 00:31:12.630
<v Speaker 4>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm not trying to sound the same to </v>

747
00:31:12.630 --> 00:31:12.630
<v Speaker 4>me by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

748
00:31:12.630 --> 00:31:15.361
<v Speaker 4>the sake of honesty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the real issue came not just because of </v>

749
00:31:15.361 --> 00:31:16.900
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but because of your characterization the</v>

750
00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:17.560
<v Speaker 4>next day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

751
00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:22.620
<v Speaker 4>totally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the next day there's a video out </v>

752
00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:23.160
<v Speaker 4>about it that someone put together </v>
<v Speaker 4>called the Kilstein delusion and some of</v>

753
00:31:23.170 --> 00:31:25.140
<v Speaker 4>that shit was taken out of context.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some of that shit I will</v>

754
00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:27.780
<v Speaker 2>completely like own up to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I watched it like once,</v>

755
00:31:27.781 --> 00:31:30.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that point,</v>

756
00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:32.550
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just all hell broke loose.</v>

757
00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:35.400
<v Speaker 2>Like I lost my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lost my managers.</v>

758
00:31:35.401 --> 00:31:38.490
<v Speaker 2>I love was having like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone hacked my twitter and just wrote</v>

759
00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:40.410
<v Speaker 2>rape all over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was kind of like,</v>

760
00:31:40.411 --> 00:31:42.540
<v Speaker 2>did you lose your manager?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

761
00:31:42.570 --> 00:31:47.570
<v Speaker 2>they said it was because I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>cooperate with the comedy community.</v>

762
00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:49.410
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be fair to them.</v>

763
00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:54.590
<v Speaker 2>I was like a pain in the ass client.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was hard enough for me to fucking </v>

764
00:31:54.590 --> 00:31:54.590
<v Speaker 2>book and then every complicates me and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

765
00:31:54.590 --> 00:31:56.520
<v Speaker 2>I don't know man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they just like threw their hands</v>

766
00:31:56.521 --> 00:31:58.210
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

767
00:31:59.010 --> 00:32:01.200
<v Speaker 2>and so the next day was one of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>things where I'm like,</v>

768
00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:05.970
<v Speaker 2>I either doubled down and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was like,</v>

769
00:32:05.971 --> 00:32:07.920
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't like I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to lie.</v>

770
00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:11.760
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna try to uh,</v>

771
00:32:11.910 --> 00:32:14.070
<v Speaker 2>defend myself and give,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

772
00:32:14.130 --> 00:32:17.080

<v Speaker 4>it wouldn't stop you here real quick </v>
<v Speaker 4>because we're going way,</v>

774
00:32:19.711 --> 00:32:20.850
<v Speaker 4>way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>way back.</v>

775
00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:25.200
<v Speaker 4>The real issue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is like a year before,</v>

776
00:32:25.201 --> 00:32:27.360
<v Speaker 4>more than a year before everything went </v>
<v Speaker 4>sideways.</v>

777
00:32:27.390 --> 00:32:28.670
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

<v Speaker 4>So you're this Super Progressive Vegan </v>

779
00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:34.260
<v Speaker 4>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what went sideways?</v>

780
00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:34.830
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

781
00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:39.270

<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

783
00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:43.850

<v Speaker 2>I can say,</v>

784
00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:46.640
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

<v Speaker 2>we were pretty much just like really </v>
<v Speaker 2>good friends,</v>

815
00:34:00.351 --> 00:34:05.351
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who lived together and did a show </v>

816
00:34:05.351 --> 00:34:06.260
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm so years later,</v>

817
00:34:06.261 --> 00:34:11.261
<v Speaker 2>years after me and this girl broke up </v>
<v Speaker 2>years after all this shit,</v>

818
00:34:11.481 --> 00:34:13.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm living in La.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

819
00:34:14.150 --> 00:34:16.610
<v Speaker 2>I have a guy had a girlfriend for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>

820
00:34:16.610 --> 00:34:19.220
<v Speaker 2>It's like a very healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wonderful relationship.</v>

821
00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:21.440
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>years after all this.</v>

822
00:34:21.530 --> 00:34:25.520
<v Speaker 2>I guess what happened was one of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>girls,</v>

823
00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:30.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm essentially started to try to find </v>
<v Speaker 2>any girl who has been pissed off by me </v>

824
00:34:30.771 --> 00:34:35.771
<v Speaker 2>before and they found enough for an </v>
<v Speaker 2>article that,</v>

825
00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:38.300
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think like two articles came out.</v>

826
00:34:38.830 --> 00:34:43.830
<v Speaker 2>I left to do some radio because the show</v>
<v Speaker 2>was getting a ton of complaints because </v>

827
00:34:43.830 --> 00:34:46.730
<v Speaker 2>our inner circles started to find out </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the record unquote accusations,</v>

828
00:34:46.731 --> 00:34:49.420
<v Speaker 2>which the word accusation makes it sound</v>
<v Speaker 2>Weinstein.</v>

829
00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:51.860
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>accusations of.</v>

830
00:34:51.890 --> 00:34:54.590
<v Speaker 2>So that's what they were saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there was,</v>

831
00:34:54.591 --> 00:34:56.240
<v Speaker 2>it was very unspecific.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I've read,</v>

832
00:34:56.241 --> 00:34:58.310
<v Speaker 2>they said predatory behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

833
00:34:58.340 --> 00:34:59.930
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning he's trying to get laid.</v>

834
00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:04.960
<v Speaker 2>That's what a man does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Predatory in the sense of you're </v>

835
00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:06.830
<v Speaker 2>victimizing someone to raping someone or</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing something horrible to someone.</v>

836
00:35:06.831 --> 00:35:11.831
<v Speaker 2>Or even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is when my own words kind of </v>

837
00:35:11.831 --> 00:35:14.921
<v Speaker 2>bit me in the ass because you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I spent an entire year a or years being </v>

838
00:35:16.281 --> 00:35:16.850
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

839
00:35:16.851 --> 00:35:18.110
<v Speaker 2>a Hashtag believed women.</v>

840
00:35:18.110 --> 00:35:19.340
<v Speaker 2>And then you read that and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

841
00:35:19.341 --> 00:35:20.330
<v Speaker 2>Hashtag don't believe women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

842
00:35:20.331 --> 00:35:22.260
<v Speaker 2>you don't know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like I,</v>

843
00:35:22.261 --> 00:35:24.470
<v Speaker 2>I was always like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you call a girl who accuses you,</v>

844
00:35:24.471 --> 00:35:25.660
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

845
00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:26.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy,</v>

846
00:35:26.391 --> 00:35:28.280
<v Speaker 2>you're just projecting and like you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to.</v>

847
00:35:28.390 --> 00:35:29.990
<v Speaker 2>And then suddenly I'm reading this </v>
<v Speaker 2>article,</v>

848
00:35:29.991 --> 00:35:31.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is fucking crazy.</v>

849
00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:32.690
<v Speaker 2>And I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

850
00:35:32.770 --> 00:35:35.180
<v Speaker 2>all of my stuff in one article you talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the,</v>

851
00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:38.580
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was Jenzabar article and Hell hath</v>

852
00:35:38.581 --> 00:35:41.190
<v Speaker 2>no fury like a woman scorned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

853
00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:46.270
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was really bad and I read it for the </v>

854
00:35:46.270 --> 00:35:48.741
<v Speaker 2>first time and I don't want to go into </v>
<v Speaker 2>details because I don't want to shit on </v>

855
00:35:48.741 --> 00:35:48.741
<v Speaker 2>people who like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel like they were,</v>

856
00:35:48.741 --> 00:35:49.530
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

857
00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:51.190
<v Speaker 2>hurt or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

858
00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:55.320
<v Speaker 2>but a good majority of the article isn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>even fucking true.</v>

859
00:35:55.660 --> 00:35:58.920
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was one part where Jezza bell even</v>

860
00:35:58.921 --> 00:36:03.921
<v Speaker 2>wrote it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if we can make it about journalism </v>

861
00:36:03.921 --> 00:36:03.921
<v Speaker 2>Jenzabar because it's one woman who </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrote it.</v>

862
00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:05.070
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>

863
00:36:05.071 --> 00:36:06.450
<v Speaker 2>So this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the author,</v>

864
00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:10.980
<v Speaker 2>there's one moment in it and I'll try to</v>
<v Speaker 2>make this about journalism and not about</v>

865
00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:12.300
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the woman,</v>

866
00:36:12.301 --> 00:36:17.301
<v Speaker 2>but one of the complaints about me was I</v>
<v Speaker 2>had a consensual night with a lady in </v>

867
00:36:20.071 --> 00:36:21.600
<v Speaker 2>Nashville,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

868
00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:23.970
<v Speaker 2>who I guess because she listened to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>show,</v>

869
00:36:23.971 --> 00:36:28.971
<v Speaker 2>maybe they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's predatory because you're like </v>

870
00:36:28.971 --> 00:36:28.971
<v Speaker 2>famous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

871
00:36:28.971 --> 00:36:28.980
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one else thinks I'm fucking famous.</v>

872
00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:29.760
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

873
00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:30.720
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

874
00:36:30.721 --> 00:36:34.230
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were defining as predatory because</v>

875
00:36:34.231 --> 00:36:36.270
<v Speaker 1>you're famous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's part of it.</v>

876
00:36:36.570 --> 00:36:38.730
<v Speaker 1>Every time Mick Jagger gets laid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's predatory.</v>

877
00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:40.930
<v Speaker 2>That's part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I don't.</v>

878
00:36:41.050 --> 00:36:42.610
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>

879
00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:45.040
<v Speaker 2>fucking call me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I'm Mick Jagger famous,</v>

880
00:36:45.041 --> 00:36:46.750
<v Speaker 2>you can call me a fucking Predator if </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

881
00:36:46.751 --> 00:36:48.310
<v Speaker 2>I can barely get a plus one to have</v>

882
00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:51.860
<v Speaker 1>vegan festival famous like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't please do not call me a predator.</v>

883
00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:52.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

884
00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:54.620
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's levels to fame,</v>

885
00:36:54.621 --> 00:36:56.600
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I know you're being self deprecating</v>

886
00:36:56.601 --> 00:37:01.601
<v Speaker 1>and everything like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you did have a nice following and </v>

887
00:37:01.601 --> 00:37:02.060
<v Speaker 1>you did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw some of your videos online.</v>

888
00:37:02.061 --> 00:37:03.720
<v Speaker 1>We did big crowds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not,</v>

889
00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:08.860
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like you didn't have fans know </v>

890
00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:11.620
<v Speaker 1>she did that fans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the idea that you liking some woman </v>

891
00:37:12.291 --> 00:37:17.291
<v Speaker 1>who's a fan and her liking you somehow </v>
<v Speaker 1>know that you're a Predator because she </v>

892
00:37:17.331 --> 00:37:20.480
<v Speaker 1>enjoys your work is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was that how they were defining it?</v>

893
00:37:20.481 --> 00:37:22.490
<v Speaker 1>Because I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

894
00:37:22.491 --> 00:37:25.460
<v Speaker 1>but then it seems like they've been very</v>
<v Speaker 1>convenient.</v>

895
00:37:25.461 --> 00:37:26.430
<v Speaker 1>Their definition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

896
00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:29.270
<v Speaker 2>and that was part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a,</v>

897
00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:32.880
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was another one where it was like,</v>

898
00:37:32.970 --> 00:37:37.970
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the predatory stuff specifically was </v>

899
00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:40.491
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then what was even more fucked up </v>

900
00:37:40.491 --> 00:37:41.230
<v Speaker 2>about the article was it said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

901
00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:44.790
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not going to quote exactly.</v>

902
00:37:44.791 --> 00:37:46.830
<v Speaker 2>She also wrote into another podcast and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard this,</v>

903
00:37:46.831 --> 00:37:49.020
<v Speaker 2>but essentially what the woman said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we did not sleep together.</v>

904
00:37:49.021 --> 00:37:54.021
<v Speaker 2>It alluded that we slept together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It didn't say that I was in an open </v>

905
00:37:54.021 --> 00:37:54.021
<v Speaker 2>relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we didn't sleep together.</v>

906
00:37:54.021 --> 00:37:55.260
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she told me she didn't want to,</v>

907
00:37:55.390 --> 00:37:56.670
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

908
00:37:57.030 --> 00:37:57.900
<v Speaker 2>sleep together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

909
00:37:57.901 --> 00:37:59.070
<v Speaker 2>great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no problem.</v>

910
00:37:59.370 --> 00:37:59.970
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want,</v>

911
00:38:00.070 --> 00:38:01.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't want it to go further than that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

912
00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:03.330
<v Speaker 2>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cool.</v>

913
00:38:03.390 --> 00:38:05.280
<v Speaker 2>Even if you change your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to do it.</v>

914
00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:10.670
<v Speaker 2>Got It.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then in the article in the article </v>

915
00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:11.850
<v Speaker 2>about me being a Predator,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like I felt so safe and,</v>

916
00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:13.710
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was a great night and I was like,</v>

917
00:38:13.711 --> 00:38:15.840
<v Speaker 2>this sounds like an article about pep </v>
<v Speaker 2>and a good dude.</v>

918
00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:21.080
<v Speaker 2>And then it said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then weeks later she heard on the </v>

919
00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:25.311
<v Speaker 2>podcast that she was just a road fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then rebel in parentheses is one,</v>

920
00:38:26.221 --> 00:38:29.970
<v Speaker 2>Arthur Arthur from Isabel and fantasy </v>
<v Speaker 2>said Jezza bell could not find the clip,</v>

921
00:38:30.090 --> 00:38:32.460
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it doesn't fucking exist because</v>

922
00:38:32.461 --> 00:38:37.461
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to call someone a road </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck next to my wife on my feminist </v>

923
00:38:37.461 --> 00:38:37.461
<v Speaker 2>podcast.</v>

924
00:38:37.461 --> 00:38:38.620
<v Speaker 3>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to say it if you didn't</v>

925
00:38:38.621 --> 00:38:40.330
<v Speaker 3>even have sex with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We didn't have sex.</v>

926
00:38:40.450 --> 00:38:41.890
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is just,</v>

927
00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:46.920
<v Speaker 3>they just decided to take this </v>
<v Speaker 3>characterization by this one woman did </v>

928
00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:48.040
<v Speaker 3>in flavor the article.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

929
00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:50.380
<v Speaker 3>It's very unfair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Dude,</v>

930
00:38:50.381 --> 00:38:55.381
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is this punishment you think for you </v>

931
00:38:55.381 --> 00:38:56.560
<v Speaker 3>because you somehow or another.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's why it becomes easy.</v>

932
00:38:56.561 --> 00:38:58.240
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and just to be like incredibly clear,</v>

933
00:38:58.241 --> 00:39:00.790
<v Speaker 3>like if this woman was like hurt by </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

934
00:39:00.970 --> 00:39:05.970
<v Speaker 3>that sucks man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been burned by girls can do </v>

935
00:39:05.970 --> 00:39:09.031
<v Speaker 3>anything if she didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if she was hurt because you didn't </v>

936
00:39:09.031 --> 00:39:10.420
<v Speaker 3>eventually become her girlfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>her boyfriend rather.</v>

937
00:39:10.810 --> 00:39:13.090
<v Speaker 3>That's just on her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

938
00:39:13.410 --> 00:39:16.380
<v Speaker 3>Unless you're mischaracter no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

939
00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:16.690
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

940
00:39:16.691 --> 00:39:18.880
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just trying to be.</v>

941
00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:20.220
<v Speaker 3>You're trying to be nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That'd be nice.</v>

942
00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:23.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well I assume she is probably,</v>

943
00:39:23.771 --> 00:39:28.771
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's probably taken out of context as </v>

944
00:39:28.771 --> 00:39:28.771
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

945
00:39:28.771 --> 00:39:30.780
<v Speaker 3>There's a real problem with writing </v>
<v Speaker 3>things about people and one of the real </v>

946
00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:34.141
<v Speaker 3>problems with writing things about </v>
<v Speaker 3>people is they don't get a chance to </v>

947
00:39:34.141 --> 00:39:34.141
<v Speaker 3>respond in real time to things you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying.</v>

948
00:39:34.141 --> 00:39:35.770
<v Speaker 3>So you establish a narrative and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>you keep going with it.</v>

949
00:39:36.010 --> 00:39:38.110
<v Speaker 3>You write paragraph after paragraph with</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

950
00:39:38.350 --> 00:39:41.400
<v Speaker 3>no one responding to them months later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I counter to,</v>

951
00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:43.340
<v Speaker 3>I saw like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

952
00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:48.420
<v Speaker 3>the woman who wrote the article,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there was a request in my like </v>

953
00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:51.240
<v Speaker 3>other inbox and facebook that like you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't even see it and like for a </v>

954
00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:51.240
<v Speaker 3>comment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like,</v>

955
00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:52.390
<v Speaker 3>I mean I got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she did reach out,</v>

956
00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:57.690
<v Speaker 3>but at that point I was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at that point I was literally googling </v>

957
00:39:57.690 --> 00:39:58.030
<v Speaker 3>ways to kill myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm like,</v>

958
00:39:58.031 --> 00:40:03.031
<v Speaker 3>I did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did not get back to googling ways to </v>

959
00:40:03.031 --> 00:40:03.031
<v Speaker 3>kill yourself for real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

960
00:40:03.031 --> 00:40:07.230
<v Speaker 3>for real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we'll just to like why put it on the </v>

961
00:40:07.230 --> 00:40:07.230
<v Speaker 3>article?</v>

962
00:40:07.230 --> 00:40:10.860
<v Speaker 3>So here's what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this goes to your question before </v>

963
00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:14.220
<v Speaker 3>because I had called so many people </v>
<v Speaker 3>sexist because I had sort of made my </v>

964
00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:18.390
<v Speaker 3>almost career by that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

965
00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:24.000
<v Speaker 3>it was fucking fun man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When people heard about this like,</v>

966
00:40:24.370 --> 00:40:29.370
<v Speaker 3>and you see the headlines and this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>another problem with like click bait </v>

967
00:40:29.370 --> 00:40:32.551
<v Speaker 3>journalism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The headlines look like I was fucking </v>

968
00:40:32.551 --> 00:40:34.560
<v Speaker 3>accused of rape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a one article that used the </v>

969
00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:37.471
<v Speaker 3>word sexual harassment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sexual misconduct was in all the </v>

970
00:40:37.471 --> 00:40:37.471
<v Speaker 3>headlines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is that?</v>

971
00:40:37.471 --> 00:40:41.170
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen that one about people </v>

972
00:40:41.170 --> 00:40:42.550
<v Speaker 3>connected to Harvey Weinstein,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like about Ben Affleck,</v>

973
00:40:42.551 --> 00:40:45.280
<v Speaker 3>they called it sexual misconduct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does that mean?</v>

974
00:40:45.281 --> 00:40:50.281
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in something that you don't think </v>

975
00:40:50.281 --> 00:40:50.281
<v Speaker 3>they should do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's really creepy?</v>

976
00:40:50.281 --> 00:40:53.960
<v Speaker 3>Eagle and I almost lost a job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did just lose a gig because when you </v>

977
00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:58.900
<v Speaker 3>google and be like sexual misconduct </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff and like that's really a scary and</v>

978
00:40:58.901 --> 00:41:00.190
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to be like,</v>

979
00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:02.080
<v Speaker 3>you know who the real victim of Harvey </v>
<v Speaker 3>Weinstein is?</v>

980
00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:03.970
<v Speaker 3>Jamie Kilstein.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like,</v>

981
00:41:04.410 --> 00:41:05.950
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me just stop you right here.</v>

982
00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:08.700
<v Speaker 3>If you say like one more time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I fucking head's going to explode dude.</v>

983
00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:10.480
<v Speaker 3>I get comments like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's brutal.</v>

984
00:41:10.481 --> 00:41:11.860
<v Speaker 3>It's a brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't as bad as.</v>

985
00:41:11.890 --> 00:41:12.770
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to,</v>

986
00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.970
<v Speaker 3>I just want you to slow it down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to use it every now and then.</v>

987
00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.870
<v Speaker 3>Flip this coffee over here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Breaking like the light meter.</v>

988
00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:21.460
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do it to men.</v>

989
00:41:21.490 --> 00:41:23.350
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an easy one to do.</v>

990
00:41:23.370 --> 00:41:27.010
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to hit switched to water,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that word is a,</v>

991
00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:28.690
<v Speaker 3>it's an,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a.</v>

992
00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:30.790
<v Speaker 3>people use it as um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

993
00:41:30.970 --> 00:41:31.870
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's okay.</v>

994
00:41:31.930 --> 00:41:33.440
<v Speaker 3>I do it too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We all do it,</v>

995
00:41:33.441 --> 00:41:33.960
<v Speaker 3>but it's just,</v>

996
00:41:34.490 --> 00:41:35.560
<v Speaker 4>it's nice to know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

997
00:41:35.590 --> 00:41:36.110
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

998
00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:40.220
<v Speaker 4>it's also a very progressive thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there's a way that people talk,</v>

999
00:41:40.221 --> 00:41:45.221
<v Speaker 4>like when they're really progressive </v>
<v Speaker 4>that like you don't hear like left wing </v>

1000
00:41:45.221 --> 00:41:48.371
<v Speaker 4>people talk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I keep getting fucked over by the </v>

1001
00:41:48.371 --> 00:41:49.730
<v Speaker 4>progressive's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a way of appearing.</v>

1002
00:41:51.350 --> 00:41:56.350
<v Speaker 4>What's the word?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Submissive or passive?</v>

1003
00:41:56.620 --> 00:41:57.740
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not a,</v>

1004
00:41:57.741 --> 00:41:59.720
<v Speaker 4>it's not an aggressive way of </v>
<v Speaker 4>communicating.</v>

1005
00:41:59.770 --> 00:42:00.920
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What if I said like,</v>

1006
00:42:00.921 --> 00:42:04.970
<v Speaker 4>but like I kept punching the table like </v>
<v Speaker 4>as I did it on a fucking like,</v>

1007
00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:10.090
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like go to like step to me just smash up</v>

1008
00:42:10.091 --> 00:42:12.920
<v Speaker 4>perhaps a can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

1009
00:42:13.010 --> 00:42:18.010
<v Speaker 4>So you got a bunch of people that were </v>
<v Speaker 4>upset at you because you had embodied </v>

1010
00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:21.200
<v Speaker 4>the quintessential allies.</v>

1011
00:42:21.290 --> 00:42:26.290
<v Speaker 2>So it was there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody had a reason to like me or to </v>

1012
00:42:26.290 --> 00:42:30.050
<v Speaker 2>defend me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On one half of the twittersphere you had</v>

1013
00:42:30.170 --> 00:42:34.520
<v Speaker 2>progressives who thought I was a sexual </v>
<v Speaker 2>creep.</v>

1014
00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:38.780
<v Speaker 2>And then on the other half you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy fans who are like,</v>

1015
00:42:38.810 --> 00:42:43.810
<v Speaker 2>fuck this dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's the one who called everyone a </v>

1016
00:42:43.810 --> 00:42:43.810
<v Speaker 2>sexist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't need to read the article.</v>

1017
00:42:43.810 --> 00:42:44.630
<v Speaker 2>If you see a headline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1018
00:42:44.631 --> 00:42:49.631
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I attacked so many people without </v>

1019
00:42:49.631 --> 00:42:51.251
<v Speaker 2>fucking reading the articles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course there are people to this day </v>

1020
00:42:51.251 --> 00:42:52.250
<v Speaker 2>that will come up on citizen radio that </v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why I was mad at.</v>

1021
00:42:52.251 --> 00:42:55.010
<v Speaker 2>I would just figure out the story as we </v>
<v Speaker 2>were covering it and be like,</v>

1022
00:42:55.011 --> 00:42:56.240
<v Speaker 2>Yep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck that guy.</v>

1023
00:42:56.241 --> 00:42:59.840
<v Speaker 2>I guess of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so nobody.</v>

1024
00:42:59.841 --> 00:43:02.600
<v Speaker 2>There was no reason to root for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There wasn't a strong enough fan base.</v>

1025
00:43:02.601 --> 00:43:04.430
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't like if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1026
00:43:04.490 --> 00:43:06.650
<v Speaker 2>a bigger comic gets accused of </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

1027
00:43:06.650 --> 00:43:11.650
<v Speaker 2>Well he has thousands or millions of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fans and then this small community who </v>

1028
00:43:11.690 --> 00:43:16.690
<v Speaker 2>accused him of something I had sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody and when I burnt all the bridges </v>

1029
00:43:16.690 --> 00:43:20.700
<v Speaker 2>and in comedy and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never just showed up at clubs to do </v>

1030
00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:23.771
<v Speaker 2>sets and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just had this audience and sort of </v>

1031
00:43:23.771 --> 00:43:24.380
<v Speaker 2>thought I could never get fired,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1032
00:43:26.110 --> 00:43:31.110
<v Speaker 2>like when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when Allie and I sort of became more </v>

1033
00:43:31.110 --> 00:43:33.610
<v Speaker 2>platonic before the open relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there were days it was,</v>

1034
00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:34.340
<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1035
00:43:34.341 --> 00:43:34.910
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1036
00:43:34.911 --> 00:43:39.911
<v Speaker 2>I mean I would sleep on the couch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there were days I would go on the </v>

1037
00:43:39.911 --> 00:43:42.761
<v Speaker 2>road and I would not cheat and I would </v>
<v Speaker 2>go back to the hotel and shirk off and </v>

1038
00:43:42.761 --> 00:43:42.761
<v Speaker 2>like my orgasm was better because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1039
00:43:42.761 --> 00:43:46.760
<v Speaker 2>I saved citizen radio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I was trying so hard not to,</v>

1040
00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:50.480
<v Speaker 2>not to do anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so anyway,</v>

1041
00:43:50.481 --> 00:43:51.980
<v Speaker 2>I lost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1042
00:43:51.981 --> 00:43:54.410
<v Speaker 2>there was no one to root for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just had this small audience.</v>

1043
00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:59.440
<v Speaker 2>A small audience either thinks I'm a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Predator or they're too nervous to say </v>

1044
00:43:59.440 --> 00:43:59.440
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1045
00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:01.530
<v Speaker 4>you fit the quintile,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1046
00:44:01.531 --> 00:44:06.531
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a classic view of what a male </v>

1047
00:44:06.531 --> 00:44:09.941
<v Speaker 4>feminist is in that classic view is a </v>
<v Speaker 4>sneaky guy that is like getting in tight</v>

1048
00:44:10.641 --> 00:44:13.220
<v Speaker 4>with women and saying all the things </v>
<v Speaker 4>they really want to hear.</v>

1049
00:44:13.610 --> 00:44:18.610
<v Speaker 4>And the classic story is that those </v>
<v Speaker 4>women are never attracted to that guy </v>

1050
00:44:18.610 --> 00:44:20.220
<v Speaker 4>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And one up and go and fuck some jocks.</v>

1051
00:44:20.221 --> 00:44:25.221
<v Speaker 4>I'm Alpha Guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't mean that's literally what </v>

1052
00:44:25.221 --> 00:44:25.221
<v Speaker 4>happened was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1053
00:44:25.221 --> 00:44:25.221
<v Speaker 4>you don't say like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you?</v>

1054
00:44:25.221 --> 00:44:28.010
<v Speaker 4>But it's just this thing that people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

1055
00:44:28.260 --> 00:44:29.840
<v Speaker 4>it's just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1056
00:44:29.870 --> 00:44:32.250
<v Speaker 4>it's a cliche and I totally,</v>

1057
00:44:32.250 --> 00:44:36.400
<v Speaker 3>and I also think it was the homophobic </v>
<v Speaker 3>politician who sucks a Dick,</v>

1058
00:44:36.570 --> 00:44:41.570
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where they're like the super religious </v>

1059
00:44:41.570 --> 00:44:42.960
<v Speaker 3>guy who turns out to actually be gay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Ted,</v>

1060
00:44:42.990 --> 00:44:46.020
<v Speaker 3>what is that guy's name?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The guy from Colorado.</v>

1061
00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:49.660
<v Speaker 3>Can we just say careers and started?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You probably couldn't,</v>

1062
00:44:49.740 --> 00:44:51.080
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was definitely a price.</v>

1063
00:44:51.750 --> 00:44:54.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so haggard Ted Haggard.</v>

1064
00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:54.960
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1065
00:44:54.980 --> 00:44:58.770
<v Speaker 3>And the Chinese have a bit about them </v>
<v Speaker 3>and who didn't.</v>

1066
00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:02.580
<v Speaker 3>And so this is what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1067
00:45:02.581 --> 00:45:06.300
<v Speaker 3>This is sort of the problem with acting </v>
<v Speaker 3>like you don't have flaws.</v>

1068
00:45:06.301 --> 00:45:08.220
<v Speaker 3>And I always did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought on the show,</v>

1069
00:45:08.221 --> 00:45:13.221
<v Speaker 3>my favorite parts of my show were when I</v>
<v Speaker 3>talked about a depression or alcoholism </v>

1070
00:45:13.741 --> 00:45:18.741
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we would get emails in from people </v>

1071
00:45:18.741 --> 00:45:21.561
<v Speaker 3>who said it really helped them and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>wanted to talk so much about that stuff </v>

1072
00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:27.050
<v Speaker 3>because I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do think it's important to examine </v>

1073
00:45:27.050 --> 00:45:27.050
<v Speaker 3>your flaws,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but on a political level,</v>

1074
00:45:27.050 --> 00:45:30.530
<v Speaker 3>I held myself up as like an untouchable.</v>

1075
00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:35.540
<v Speaker 3>I think you were doing essentially the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same thing that you were talking about </v>

1076
00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:38.961
<v Speaker 3>doing on twitter where you're addicted </v>
<v Speaker 3>to this positive response and you're </v>

1077
00:45:38.961 --> 00:45:43.210
<v Speaker 3>addicted to saying these things about </v>
<v Speaker 3>people and attacking people there.</v>

1078
00:45:43.950 --> 00:45:48.950
<v Speaker 3>It's a real problem on the left where </v>
<v Speaker 3>there are people that essentially a </v>

1079
00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:53.940
<v Speaker 3>giant majority of what they do is </v>
<v Speaker 3>attacking people.</v>

1080
00:45:53.941 --> 00:45:58.941
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you also get scared about what you </v>

1081
00:45:58.941 --> 00:46:00.801
<v Speaker 3>can talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So one of the things that would come up </v>

1082
00:46:00.801 --> 00:46:02.430
<v Speaker 3>a lot was like fat shaming stories on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the show,</v>

1083
00:46:03.210 --> 00:46:07.200
<v Speaker 3>but what also came up was like I fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>loved Jujitsu and so we would get emails</v>

1084
00:46:07.201 --> 00:46:09.030
<v Speaker 3>from people who are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yo,</v>

1085
00:46:09.031 --> 00:46:11.910
<v Speaker 3>my doctor just said like I have to lose </v>
<v Speaker 3>weight or I'm fucked or whatever.</v>

1086
00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:17.240
<v Speaker 3>And the first thing I would recommend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I would give that advice and I </v>

1087
00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:17.240
<v Speaker 3>would be like Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go fucking do Jujitsu.</v>

1088
00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:20.640
<v Speaker 3>And then we got countless emails from </v>
<v Speaker 3>people who are like,</v>

1089
00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:22.530
<v Speaker 3>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I lost 100 pounds because I did Jujitsu.</v>

1090
00:46:22.531 --> 00:46:23.580
<v Speaker 3>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just got my blue belt.</v>

1091
00:46:23.581 --> 00:46:25.320
<v Speaker 3>Like I feel confident for the first time</v>
<v Speaker 3>or whatever.</v>

1092
00:46:25.470 --> 00:46:29.370
<v Speaker 3>And then we would get emails,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a counter emails being like,</v>

1093
00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:32.100
<v Speaker 3>I don't want you to talk about that </v>
<v Speaker 3>because that's fat shaming to me.</v>

1094
00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:36.570
<v Speaker 3>And I couldn't say that's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't say,</v>

1095
00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:41.600
<v Speaker 3>why couldn't you say that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it would be fetching it in the </v>

1096
00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:44.871
<v Speaker 3>box that I had put myself in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't say that I was capable of </v>

1097
00:46:44.871 --> 00:46:44.871
<v Speaker 3>saying it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought it.</v>

1098
00:46:44.871 --> 00:46:49.071
<v Speaker 3>I set it off the air.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you see this is where it gets real </v>

1099
00:46:49.071 --> 00:46:50.990
<v Speaker 3>problematic when it comes to expressing </v>
<v Speaker 3>your ideologies.</v>

1100
00:46:51.010 --> 00:46:53.640
<v Speaker 3>Like if you can't be honest about your </v>
<v Speaker 3>actual thoughts,</v>

1101
00:46:53.641 --> 00:46:55.890
<v Speaker 3>then what you're doing is bullshit </v>
<v Speaker 3>bullshit.</v>

1102
00:46:56.190 --> 00:47:01.190
<v Speaker 3>And there is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the the other side to the validation of </v>

1103
00:47:01.190 --> 00:47:04.620
<v Speaker 3>ones you find yourself in a box is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the policing of it.</v>

1104
00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:06.930
<v Speaker 3>So there's validation on one side and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then there's,</v>

1105
00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:09.330
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can get kicked out on the other side.</v>

1106
00:47:09.331 --> 00:47:10.800
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if I say this word,</v>

1107
00:47:10.801 --> 00:47:14.880
<v Speaker 3>I can get kicked out if I say that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you should not fucking come down on</v>

1108
00:47:14.881 --> 00:47:17.670
<v Speaker 3>someone for doing Jujitsu and getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>into better shape than you.</v>

1109
00:47:17.671 --> 00:47:22.671
<v Speaker 3>If you don't want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying this guy is doing </v>

1110
00:47:22.671 --> 00:47:22.671
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so fuck you for being fat.</v>

1111
00:47:22.671 --> 00:47:24.450
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying this guy's doing Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We should be proud of this guy who saved</v>

1112
00:47:24.451 --> 00:47:26.790
<v Speaker 3>his life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not fat shaming.</v>

1113
00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:31.820
<v Speaker 3>And there's so much of that projection </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the left were [inaudible] on </v>

1114
00:47:31.820 --> 00:47:34.330
<v Speaker 3>twitter in general where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why is that though?</v>

1115
00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:37.320
<v Speaker 3>I mean it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it really is the ideology thing.</v>

1116
00:47:37.350 --> 00:47:42.350
<v Speaker 3>So like you are unable to criticize </v>
<v Speaker 3>anyone that's in your team because this </v>

1117
00:47:43.301 --> 00:47:47.770
<v Speaker 3>is essentially what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they're using the phrase fat shaming,</v>

1118
00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:52.330
<v Speaker 3>which is obviously a progressive </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideology or it fits right into it.</v>

1119
00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:57.780
<v Speaker 3>But for someone to say that you're fat </v>
<v Speaker 3>shaming by discussing people </v>

1120
00:47:57.780 --> 00:48:01.830
<v Speaker 3>successfully managing their health,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's fucking intense where it gets </v>

1121
00:48:01.830 --> 00:48:01.990
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you,</v>

1122
00:48:03.010 --> 00:48:05.380
<v Speaker 3>if you wanted to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you wanted to talk about.</v>

1123
00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:07.280
<v Speaker 3>Of course I did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Allison,</v>

1124
00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:08.620
<v Speaker 3>who as well?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1125
00:48:08.650 --> 00:48:10.330
<v Speaker 3>I mean I can't speak for her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1126
00:48:10.331 --> 00:48:15.331
<v Speaker 3>But you guys have conversations off the </v>
<v Speaker 3>air about what this is crazy would have </v>

1127
00:48:15.331 --> 00:48:16.690
<v Speaker 3>conversations about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1128
00:48:17.050 --> 00:48:18.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you don't.</v>

1129
00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:20.170
<v Speaker 3>Because fat shaming sex,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1130
00:48:20.171 --> 00:48:22.060
<v Speaker 3>Like if someone gets fired for being </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1131
00:48:22.090 --> 00:48:24.370
<v Speaker 3>that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a middle ground,</v>

1132
00:48:24.590 --> 00:48:29.590
<v Speaker 3>so slippery road when you can honestly </v>
<v Speaker 3>communicate and this is what the debate </v>

1133
00:48:29.590 --> 00:48:29.650
<v Speaker 3>side gets silenced.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's done.</v>

1134
00:48:29.651 --> 00:48:31.960
<v Speaker 3>And that's what happens with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1135
00:48:31.961 --> 00:48:36.961
<v Speaker 3>I was listening to a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was Sam's podcast with the </v>

1136
00:48:36.961 --> 00:48:39.250
<v Speaker 3>guy who got screened off of that campus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sam Harris,</v>

1137
00:48:40.450 --> 00:48:42.450
<v Speaker 3>Jordan Peterson maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>

1138
00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:42.640
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1139
00:48:42.690 --> 00:48:44.950
<v Speaker 3>The guy that was a halloween costume </v>
<v Speaker 3>wise,</v>

1140
00:48:45.210 --> 00:48:46.030
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1141
00:48:46.031 --> 00:48:51.031
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from it was him and his wife and he was </v>

1142
00:48:51.031 --> 00:48:52.510
<v Speaker 3>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sounded like the sweetest guy.</v>

1143
00:48:52.540 --> 00:48:52.910
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>

1144
00:48:52.930 --> 00:48:54.040
<v Speaker 3>I just knew,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1145
00:48:54.041 --> 00:48:55.570
<v Speaker 3>I fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember when,</v>

1146
00:48:55.690 --> 00:48:59.760
<v Speaker 3>but I can guarantee there's an episode </v>
<v Speaker 3>about that guy was just like,</v>

1147
00:48:59.950 --> 00:49:01.140
<v Speaker 3>I was defending my wife.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

1148
00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:03.190
<v Speaker 3>I've given to progressive causes my </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole life.</v>

1149
00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:08.340
<v Speaker 3>I just tried to talk to them and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would raise his hand and they would </v>

1150
00:49:08.340 --> 00:49:09.310
<v Speaker 3>call it like a fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some kind of like microaggression or,</v>

1151
00:49:09.311 --> 00:49:10.720
<v Speaker 3>or I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even remember what,</v>

1152
00:49:11.130 --> 00:49:13.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happened to evergreen,</v>

1153
00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:15.790
<v Speaker 3>evergreen steaks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I heard it on your show.</v>

1154
00:49:15.791 --> 00:49:16.600
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1155
00:49:16.601 --> 00:49:17.830
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did hear that episode.</v>

1156
00:49:17.831 --> 00:49:18.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1157
00:49:18.881 --> 00:49:21.160
<v Speaker 3>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a very extreme example.</v>

1158
00:49:21.161 --> 00:49:23.410
<v Speaker 3>What they were telling the president to </v>
<v Speaker 3>put his hands down.</v>

1159
00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:25.460
<v Speaker 3>That's what I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you are making these,</v>

1160
00:49:25.461 --> 00:49:27.070
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're being aggressive with your hands.</v>

1161
00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:32.220
<v Speaker 3>So he did put his hands down and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>started laughing because that's what's </v>

1162
00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:32.220
<v Speaker 3>really going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a game.</v>

1163
00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:33.130
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the thing is too,</v>

1164
00:49:33.131 --> 00:49:38.131
<v Speaker 3>it's like we have such legit racism and </v>
<v Speaker 3>sexism in this country and I feel like </v>

1165
00:49:40.150 --> 00:49:43.300
<v Speaker 3>we should be going after those issues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1166
00:49:43.330 --> 00:49:48.330
<v Speaker 3>Well that's why I think you are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This conversation is very important </v>

1167
00:49:48.330 --> 00:49:52.690
<v Speaker 3>because you are an example of someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>who got caught up in the ideology of </v>

1168
00:49:52.690 --> 00:49:54.460
<v Speaker 3>things where your intentions were good </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the beginning,</v>

1169
00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:57.940
<v Speaker 3>but you got caught up in this whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>leftwing spiral.</v>

1170
00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:01.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing is if you go extreme,</v>

1171
00:50:01.300 --> 00:50:03.220
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like,</v>

1172
00:50:03.221 --> 00:50:04.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I had like a big,</v>

1173
00:50:04.301 --> 00:50:07.930
<v Speaker 3>like Nazi kill the Jews,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like closing prop bit.</v>

1174
00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:09.550
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I would know I was selling </v>
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>

1175
00:50:09.551 --> 00:50:12.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but on the left it's a creep man because</v>

1176
00:50:12.701 --> 00:50:14.320
<v Speaker 3>you really feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

1177
00:50:14.321 --> 00:50:16.750
<v Speaker 3>the baseline of homophobia is bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sexism is bad,</v>

1178
00:50:17.860 --> 00:50:20.890
<v Speaker 3>racism is bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are good things.</v>

1179
00:50:20.891 --> 00:50:25.891
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when it starts to creep into the </v>

1180
00:50:25.891 --> 00:50:26.980
<v Speaker 3>language policing and stuff like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least for me,</v>

1181
00:50:26.990 --> 00:50:28.280
<v Speaker 3>I didn't really</v>

1182
00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:30.680
<v Speaker 2>notice it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would notice it sometimes and be like,</v>

1183
00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:35.710
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish I could say this and I wouldn't </v>

1184
00:50:35.710 --> 00:50:36.800
<v Speaker 2>because I wouldn't wanna get in trouble </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it bit me in the ass anyway.</v>

1185
00:50:37.250 --> 00:50:42.250
<v Speaker 2>And you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the suicide stuff was like,</v>

1186
00:50:42.380 --> 00:50:44.000
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I had,</v>

1187
00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:48.920
<v Speaker 2>I had nothing people on twitter stopped </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing shows.</v>

1188
00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:49.900
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I stopped,</v>

1189
00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:52.430
<v Speaker 2>I got a day job for the first time in </v>
<v Speaker 2>like 15.</v>

1190
00:50:52.431 --> 00:50:54.850
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing for a living years?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A jujitsu stuff.</v>

1191
00:50:55.500 --> 00:50:58.280
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

1192
00:50:58.870 --> 00:51:03.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but even this stuff like I don't want to</v>

1193
00:51:03.261 --> 00:51:06.440
<v Speaker 2>put that fucking job is in jeopardy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1194
00:51:06.441 --> 00:51:10.490
<v Speaker 2>Like at least it's something I love and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

1195
00:51:10.491 --> 00:51:12.590
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't perform.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't because again,</v>

1196
00:51:12.591 --> 00:51:13.190
<v Speaker 2>remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1197
00:51:13.530 --> 00:51:16.040
<v Speaker 2>so you felt like your audience was gone?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Audience gone.</v>

1198
00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:16.790
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>straight up.</v>

1199
00:51:16.820 --> 00:51:19.910
<v Speaker 2>I mean there was a facebook comment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just stopped going online,</v>

1200
00:51:19.911 --> 00:51:22.310
<v Speaker 2>but there was a facebook comment from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the day before there was like,</v>

1201
00:51:22.340 --> 00:51:25.010
<v Speaker 2>just so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you saved me from killing myself.</v>

1202
00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:28.040
<v Speaker 2>And then the next day when all that shit</v>
<v Speaker 2>broke loose,</v>

1203
00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:33.160
<v Speaker 2>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can like add a comment to your </v>

1204
00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:33.160
<v Speaker 2>comment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

1205
00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:33.160
<v Speaker 2>fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope you whatever.</v>

1206
00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:35.030
<v Speaker 2>Same dude like literally added it to his</v>
<v Speaker 2>comment,</v>

1207
00:51:35.110 --> 00:51:40.110
<v Speaker 4>but you need to think about some of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>things that you said and realized that </v>

1208
00:51:40.110 --> 00:51:44.161
<v Speaker 4>you didn't really mean them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you were saying them because you </v>

1209
00:51:44.161 --> 00:51:45.580
<v Speaker 4>want your trading in the currency of </v>
<v Speaker 4>political,</v>

1210
00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:47.470
<v Speaker 4>correct,</v>
<v Speaker 4>left wing,</v>

1211
00:51:47.471 --> 00:51:49.150
<v Speaker 4>progressive ideology thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1212
00:51:49.170 --> 00:51:50.860
<v Speaker 4>And you were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you were getting from that.</v>

1213
00:51:51.070 --> 00:51:53.920
<v Speaker 4>But you gotta realize these other people</v>
<v Speaker 4>are doing the same thing.</v>

1214
00:51:54.220 --> 00:51:56.260
<v Speaker 4>Like they don't really mean what they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>saying.</v>

1215
00:51:56.261 --> 00:51:58.000
<v Speaker 4>They feel like they have to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck you.</v>

1216
00:51:58.001 --> 00:51:59.410
<v Speaker 4>I hope you die.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jamie Kilstein.</v>

1217
00:51:59.740 --> 00:52:03.580
<v Speaker 4>They don't even know you well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we have a real problem both left</v>

1218
00:52:03.581 --> 00:52:06.610
<v Speaker 4>and right in this country with attacking</v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

1219
00:52:06.730 --> 00:52:09.640
<v Speaker 4>And I hate to say this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think we have a problem with doing</v>

1220
00:52:09.641 --> 00:52:14.641
<v Speaker 4>that with trump because although he has </v>
<v Speaker 4>done some reprehensible things and he </v>

1221
00:52:14.951 --> 00:52:18.520
<v Speaker 4>said some really foolish things and his </v>
<v Speaker 4>ego is ridiculous.</v>

1222
00:52:18.521 --> 00:52:20.590
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of things wrong with him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1223
00:52:20.950 --> 00:52:24.670
<v Speaker 4>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the attacks on him at all this attacking</v>

1224
00:52:25.060 --> 00:52:30.060
<v Speaker 4>instead of sort of laying out a better </v>
<v Speaker 4>way instead of explaining what's wrong </v>

1225
00:52:31.991 --> 00:52:36.991
<v Speaker 4>with it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's all insulting and attacking that </v>

1226
00:52:36.991 --> 00:52:36.991
<v Speaker 4>doesn't fix anything and it's not</v>

1227
00:52:36.991 --> 00:52:41.330
<v Speaker 2>going to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it also is going to make his people </v>

1228
00:52:41.330 --> 00:52:41.330
<v Speaker 2>double down and they're not gonna want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to listen to it either.</v>

1229
00:52:41.330 --> 00:52:41.980
<v Speaker 2>My point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I.</v>

1230
00:52:41.981 --> 00:52:46.981
<v Speaker 2>that's what I noticed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why you never want a twitter </v>

1231
00:52:46.981 --> 00:52:46.981
<v Speaker 2>argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1232
00:52:46.981 --> 00:52:46.981
<v Speaker 2>Do you have like extreme one side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an extreme other side is like,</v>

1233
00:52:46.981 --> 00:52:51.721
<v Speaker 2>cool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna solve this in 140 </v>

1234
00:52:51.721 --> 00:52:51.721
<v Speaker 2>characters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

1235
00:52:51.721 --> 00:52:53.160
<v Speaker 4>The problem is also people start </v>
<v Speaker 4>insulting each other.</v>

1236
00:52:53.430 --> 00:52:55.490
<v Speaker 4>It just doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't yet.</v>

1237
00:52:55.860 --> 00:53:00.860
<v Speaker 4>It becomes a contest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like you try to do that and I go </v>

1238
00:53:00.860 --> 00:53:03.030
<v Speaker 4>check and then you go check and then we </v>
<v Speaker 4>move in back and forth and you're trying</v>

1239
00:53:03.031 --> 00:53:03.670
<v Speaker 4>to fucking get.</v>

1240
00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:09.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then like people's twitter bios or </v>

1241
00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:09.280
<v Speaker 2>like their whole bio or like here's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>list of people who blocked me.</v>

1242
00:53:09.281 --> 00:53:11.750
<v Speaker 2>It's like Yo man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that's your fucking,</v>

1243
00:53:11.860 --> 00:53:14.470
<v Speaker 2>that's your resume,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's your life accolades.</v>

1244
00:53:14.471 --> 00:53:19.471
<v Speaker 2>Like that's such a bummer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I wouldn't have people block me and </v>

1245
00:53:19.471 --> 00:53:22.891
<v Speaker 2>I never even communicated with them </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I somehow or another I got on </v>

1246
00:53:22.891 --> 00:53:26.881
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a list or someone decided </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was about a guy I use that and I </v>

1247
00:53:26.881 --> 00:53:26.881
<v Speaker 2>don't</v>

1248
00:53:26.881 --> 00:53:28.520
<v Speaker 3>know how to reverse it because now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>between each line and your power.</v>

1289
00:55:12.540 --> 00:55:17.280
<v Speaker 3>It's almost a performance art piece is </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing the actual standard.</v>

1290
00:55:17.281 --> 00:55:18.630

<v Speaker 3>They're not laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My friend just,</v>

<v Speaker 3>It was a cadence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like I'm a drummer and also when </v>

1294
00:55:27.430 --> 00:55:27.720
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't getting booked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like after nine slash 11,</v>

1295
00:55:28.650 --> 00:55:32.010
<v Speaker 3>my stuff was really political and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't getting booked in New York,</v>

1296
00:55:32.490 --> 00:55:35.280
<v Speaker 3>so I would just go to slam poetry places</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I just made,</v>

1297
00:55:35.310 --> 00:55:36.870
<v Speaker 3>if I had a gay rights joke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1298
00:55:36.900 --> 00:55:41.900
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well let's just do a three minute gay </v>

1299
00:55:41.900 --> 00:55:41.900
<v Speaker 3>rights chunk.</v>

1300
00:55:41.900 --> 00:55:41.900
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I started to get booked,</v>

1301
00:55:41.900 --> 00:55:43.050
<v Speaker 3>but at some of it was really well </v>
<v Speaker 3>written.</v>

1302
00:55:43.051 --> 00:55:48.051
<v Speaker 3>I saw this one thing that you did in </v>
<v Speaker 3>front of some big giant group of people </v>

1303
00:55:48.051 --> 00:55:48.051
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1304
00:55:48.051 --> 00:55:50.840

<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1305
00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:52.770
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was at the Lib qualys show.</v>

1306
00:55:52.810 --> 00:55:55.650

<v Speaker 3>All this shit happened like right after.</v>

1307
00:55:56.130 --> 00:55:56.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

1308
00:55:56.770 --> 00:56:00.870
<v Speaker 3>it was a real bummer right after I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in La,</v>

1309
00:56:01.060 --> 00:56:03.330
<v Speaker 3>my.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I was suicidal in New York,</v>

1310
00:56:03.810 --> 00:56:06.490
<v Speaker 3>which I've never talked about publicly </v>
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>

1311
00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:09.150
<v Speaker 3>Before that was very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was very,</v>

1312
00:56:09.151 --> 00:56:10.890
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very suicidal.</v>

1313
00:56:11.310 --> 00:56:12.140
<v Speaker 3>Here's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1314
00:56:12.210 --> 00:56:16.850
<v Speaker 3>I was just in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to say like love,</v>

1315
00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:21.940
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to be mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was in like a failed </v>

1316
00:56:21.940 --> 00:56:21.940
<v Speaker 3>relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

1317
00:56:21.940 --> 00:56:25.381
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I didn't have friends and I wasn't </v>

1318
00:56:25.381 --> 00:56:25.381
<v Speaker 3>doing comedy.</v>

1319
00:56:25.381 --> 00:56:28.060
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you have friends in New York?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had friends when I would do Jujitsu at</v>

1320
00:56:28.090 --> 00:56:31.600
<v Speaker 2>friends of Marcello's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like those guys were absolutely the best</v>

1321
00:56:31.601 --> 00:56:33.610
<v Speaker 2>friends I had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't have,</v>

1322
00:56:33.611 --> 00:56:37.960
<v Speaker 2>I didn't feel like I had like a career </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I had a couple friends.</v>

1323
00:56:37.961 --> 00:56:42.961
<v Speaker 2>I mean all of our friends were pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>much linked to that same sort of </v>

1324
00:56:42.961 --> 00:56:45.451
<v Speaker 2>progressive circle when I went home to </v>
<v Speaker 2>see my brothers and I could talk how I </v>

1325
00:56:45.451 --> 00:56:49.681
<v Speaker 2>want it to and I could shoot the shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I could like not police my own </v>

1326
00:56:49.681 --> 00:56:49.681
<v Speaker 2>language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was amazing.</v>

1327
00:56:49.681 --> 00:56:54.330
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would go walk around blocks just to </v>

1328
00:56:54.330 --> 00:56:56.521
<v Speaker 2>talk to my brother Nick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like for hours and we would just laugh </v>

1329
00:56:56.521 --> 00:56:59.680
<v Speaker 2>and tell jokes and shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I had depression forever and </v>

1330
00:56:59.840 --> 00:57:01.750
<v Speaker 2>I've been self hating forever and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1331
00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:06.760
<v Speaker 2>this is not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't by any means blaming on other </v>

1332
00:57:06.760 --> 00:57:06.760
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I remember,</v>

1333
00:57:06.760 --> 00:57:09.580
<v Speaker 2>and this kind of ties in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is really fucked up.</v>

1334
00:57:09.580 --> 00:57:12.930
<v Speaker 2>This kind of ties into what you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about with like microaggressions</v>

1335
00:57:12.940 --> 00:57:13.650
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1336
00:57:13.810 --> 00:57:18.810
<v Speaker 2>and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember I tried to open up to </v>

1337
00:57:18.810 --> 00:57:22.201
<v Speaker 2>somebody very close to me about being </v>
<v Speaker 2>suicidal and they told me that,</v>

1338
00:57:23.570 --> 00:57:26.560
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget the progressive word for it,</v>

1339
00:57:27.130 --> 00:57:29.500
<v Speaker 2>but they said it was like manipulative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Essentially.</v>

1340
00:57:29.950 --> 00:57:34.950
<v Speaker 2>You being depressed was a minute of me </v>
<v Speaker 2>being suicidal by telling them I was </v>

1341
00:57:34.950 --> 00:57:37.570
<v Speaker 2>suicidal because I was telling them what</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're looking for help right now.</v>

1342
00:57:37.571 --> 00:57:39.730
<v Speaker 2>With that said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people who were like,</v>

1343
00:57:39.731 --> 00:57:41.320
<v Speaker 2>if you break up with me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to kill myself.</v>

1344
00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:43.210
<v Speaker 2>That's fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1345
00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:48.600
<v Speaker 2>That's like holding them hostage or </v>
<v Speaker 2>making them feel like they would be </v>

1346
00:57:48.600 --> 00:57:51.451
<v Speaker 2>responsible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That I guess I would consider that's </v>

1347
00:57:51.451 --> 00:57:51.451
<v Speaker 2>manipulative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1348
00:57:51.451 --> 00:57:51.510
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's certainly not good.</v>

1349
00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:53.610
<v Speaker 2>It's not healthy yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>

1350
00:57:54.040 --> 00:57:57.820
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you reach out for help,</v>

1351
00:57:58.060 --> 00:57:58.870
<v Speaker 2>but that's fucked up.</v>

1352
00:57:59.050 --> 00:58:04.050
<v Speaker 2>And so I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't feel like I had a lot of </v>

1353
00:58:04.050 --> 00:58:06.511
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had my family and stuff like that and </v>

1354
00:58:06.511 --> 00:58:07.990
<v Speaker 2>that's why one of the reasons I moved to</v>
<v Speaker 2>La as I came out to here and I did a big</v>

1355
00:58:07.991 --> 00:58:11.320
<v Speaker 2>show and it was great and I love La and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always wanted to live here.</v>

1356
00:58:11.321 --> 00:58:13.090
<v Speaker 2>So once my relationship ended I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1357
00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:14.800
<v Speaker 2>I've always wanted to go to la.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go to La.</v>

1358
00:58:15.700 --> 00:58:18.460
<v Speaker 2>So I go to La and then the winter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1359
00:58:18.820 --> 00:58:21.160
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every New Yorker who's like,</v>

00:59:19.561 --> 00:59:22.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they make like really Marino will</v>

1385
00:59:22.310 --> 00:59:25.730
<v Speaker 4>wool clothing for hunting and they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the first guys to figure it out.</v>

1386
00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:28.520
<v Speaker 4>That's what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it's a natural fiber,</v>

1387
00:59:28.600 --> 00:59:32.180
<v Speaker 4>has a wool and wool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a weird thing,</v>

1388
00:59:32.181 --> 00:59:34.120
<v Speaker 4>like if you have a cotton shirt on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

1389
00:59:34.430 --> 00:59:37.130
<v Speaker 4>And you get wet from sweat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like say if you hike up a hill,</v>

1390
00:59:37.310 --> 00:59:41.060
<v Speaker 4>but it's cold out and then you sit down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you will freeze your fucking ass off and</v>

1391
00:59:41.061 --> 00:59:43.790
<v Speaker 4>it's really bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you can get hypothermia that way,</v>

1392
00:59:44.270 --> 00:59:47.030
<v Speaker 4>but if you have wool on it retains the </v>
<v Speaker 4>heat,</v>

1393
00:59:47.090 --> 00:59:48.500
<v Speaker 4>the buyer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even if it's wet,</v>

1394
00:59:48.530 --> 00:59:51.890
<v Speaker 4>it's really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you just were a,</v>

1395
00:59:51.950 --> 00:59:54.680
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a base layer of Merino wool,</v>

1396
00:59:55.110 --> 00:59:57.020
<v Speaker 4>like when you go out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like in cold weather,</v>

1397
00:59:57.380 --> 01:00:02.380
<v Speaker 4>you will get wet from the sweat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but your body will retain heat to stay </v>

1398
01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:02.380
<v Speaker 4>warm.</v>

1399
01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:06.270
<v Speaker 2>Well now in la I got to pull up the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking Hensley was my little </v>

1400
01:00:06.270 --> 01:00:09.150
<v Speaker 2>preassembled chain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say Bye to everybody and get back in my </v>

1401

<v Speaker 2>car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1402
01:00:09.150 --> 01:00:09.960
<v Speaker 2>it's fascinating.</v>

1403
01:00:10.060 --> 01:00:15.060
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to lay a towel down so you </v>

1404
01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:15.060
<v Speaker 4>don't sweat through your seat.</v>

1405
01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:15.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1406
01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:15.060
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>

1407
01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:15.400
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1408
01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:18.500
<v Speaker 2>so yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I moved to La and I met my girlfriend</v>

1409
01:00:18.501 --> 01:00:20.930
<v Speaker 2>and it's like the most healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wonderful relationship.</v>

1410
01:00:20.931 --> 01:00:25.931
<v Speaker 2>My poor girl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my girlfriend was a comedy fan when she </v>

1411
01:00:25.931 --> 01:00:27.980
<v Speaker 2>met me and not a feminist and she saw me</v>
<v Speaker 2>at cobb's.</v>

1412
01:00:27.981 --> 01:00:31.700
<v Speaker 2>I was one of the clubs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would still like play me and I,</v>

1413
01:00:31.701 --> 01:00:36.701
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when we first met I think she got </v>

1414
01:00:36.701 --> 01:00:39.581
<v Speaker 2>excited that she was going to date a </v>
<v Speaker 2>comic because she's like a huge comedy </v>

1415
01:00:39.581 --> 01:00:42.641
<v Speaker 2>fan dude and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we moved in together and she would be </v>

1416
01:00:42.641 --> 01:00:42.641
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1417
01:00:42.690 --> 01:00:43.910
<v Speaker 2>is exaggerated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it would be like,</v>

1418
01:00:43.911 --> 01:00:45.770
<v Speaker 2>do you listen to bill burrs podcast?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'd be like,</v>

1419
01:00:45.830 --> 01:00:50.830
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well let me tell you why he's </v>

1420
01:00:50.830 --> 01:00:50.830
<v Speaker 2>problematic and upholds the patriarchy </v>
<v Speaker 2>and she must've been like,</v>

1421
01:00:50.830 --> 01:00:52.500
<v Speaker 2>fucking shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But she's like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1423
01:00:54.700 --> 01:00:56.930
<v Speaker 2>kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now once all this shit happened,</v>

1424
01:00:56.931 --> 01:00:59.840
<v Speaker 2>I get to discover all these great people</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't allowed to watch.</v>

1425
01:00:59.930 --> 01:01:04.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you know that these woody Allen </v>

1426
01:01:04.930 --> 01:01:06.221
<v Speaker 2>movies are good?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I've watched Manchester by the sea </v>

1427
01:01:06.221 --> 01:01:06.221
<v Speaker 2>and it was great.</v>

1428
01:01:06.221 --> 01:01:06.221
<v Speaker 4>I met you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I met you.</v>

1429
01:01:06.221 --> 01:01:10.791
<v Speaker 4>You were deep in the throes or you were </v>
<v Speaker 4>beginning your journey of progressivism.</v>

1430
01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:12.300
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you were,</v>

1431
01:01:12.301 --> 01:01:13.290
<v Speaker 4>you were on your way.</v>

1432
01:01:13.460 --> 01:01:15.540
<v Speaker 2>First show we did was great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we know.</v>

1433
01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:15.750
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1434
01:01:15.750 --> 01:01:16.680
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not what I mean.</v>

1435
01:01:16.681 --> 01:01:17.910
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what I'm saying is,</v>

1436
01:01:17.911 --> 01:01:21.540
<v Speaker 4>but I knew people that knew you from </v>
<v Speaker 4>back in the day,</v>

1437
01:01:21.750 --> 01:01:23.000
<v Speaker 4>like stanhill Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1438
01:01:23.050 --> 01:01:24.690
<v Speaker 4>I remember what kills team is just a </v>
<v Speaker 4>comic.</v>

1439
01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:29.720
<v Speaker 4>It was just a comment because one of us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then he let you assume this </v>

1440
01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:30.020
<v Speaker 4>identity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but um,</v>

1441
01:01:30.450 --> 01:01:34.140
<v Speaker 4>all of us are susceptible to ideologies </v>
<v Speaker 4>and be like,</v>

1442
01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:39.200
<v Speaker 4>Jordan Peterson had a really fascinating</v>
<v Speaker 4>take a nazi-ism about these,</v>

1443
01:01:39.660 --> 01:01:44.660
<v Speaker 4>these people that became Nazis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what's most terrifying about it is </v>

1444
01:01:46.050 --> 01:01:47.970
<v Speaker 4>that have you were in their exact same </v>
<v Speaker 4>shoes.</v>

1445
01:01:47.971 --> 01:01:51.870
<v Speaker 4>You are a human being and it is quite </v>
<v Speaker 4>possible that you could have been a Nazi</v>

1446
01:01:51.871 --> 01:01:53.840
<v Speaker 4>too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that is terrifying people.</v>

1447
01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:57.300
<v Speaker 4>But that obviously that's a very evil </v>
<v Speaker 4>ideology.</v>

1448
01:01:57.301 --> 01:02:00.150
<v Speaker 4>But ideologies in general,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're all susceptible to them.</v>

1449
01:02:00.151 --> 01:02:02.310
<v Speaker 4>I've been susceptible to ideologies my </v>
<v Speaker 4>whole life.</v>

1450
01:02:02.311 --> 01:02:07.311
<v Speaker 4>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a very addictive personality and </v>

1451
01:02:07.311 --> 01:02:10.280
<v Speaker 4>I think that's one of the reasons why </v>
<v Speaker 4>you and I connect our on Jujitsu things </v>

1452
01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:13.851
<v Speaker 4>along those lines because you get </v>
<v Speaker 4>obsessed with these things and they </v>

1453
01:02:13.851 --> 01:02:17.430
<v Speaker 4>become a part of your identity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think for you,</v>

1454
01:02:17.490 --> 01:02:20.190
<v Speaker 4>progressivism was in that box.</v>

1455
01:02:20.190 --> 01:02:21.620
<v Speaker 3>It was in that wheelhouse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1456
01:02:21.740 --> 01:02:26.740
<v Speaker 3>and we all crave acceptance and comfort </v>
<v Speaker 3>and support and a tribe,</v>

1457
01:02:28.471 --> 01:02:30.050
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1458
01:02:30.150 --> 01:02:34.380
<v Speaker 3>and so and again with progressivism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't sound like an evil thing.</v>

1459
01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:37.590
<v Speaker 3>It's not like I was in a gang,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like no parents or warning kids.</v>

1460
01:02:37.591 --> 01:02:38.000
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1461
01:02:38.090 --> 01:02:40.830
<v Speaker 3>I hear Noam Chomsky blasted out of his </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking stereo.</v>

1462
01:02:40.831 --> 01:02:42.120
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't happen.</v>

1463
01:02:42.510 --> 01:02:45.730
<v Speaker 3>So you don't really does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really slow anyway,</v>

1464
01:02:45.731 --> 01:02:46.950
<v Speaker 3>are really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really slow.</v>

1465
01:02:47.670 --> 01:02:50.190
<v Speaker 3>He talks like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not a problem.</v>

1466
01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:53.340
<v Speaker 3>I tried to ask him a relationship </v>
<v Speaker 3>question just to change it up and he was</v>

1467
01:02:53.341 --> 01:02:54.510
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to answer that.</v>

1468
01:02:54.570 --> 01:02:55.450
<v Speaker 3>I was say that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1469
01:02:55.540 --> 01:02:56.250
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>

1470
01:02:56.430 --> 01:03:01.430
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1471

<v Speaker 3>the interview relationship question.</v>

<v Speaker 3>operates in.</v>

1482
01:03:16.050 --> 01:03:17.280
<v Speaker 3>Howard Zinn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I interviewed,</v>

1483
01:03:17.281 --> 01:03:18.630

<v Speaker 3>house.</v>

01:03:42.901 --> 01:03:44.430
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was awesome.</v>

1500
01:03:44.430 --> 01:03:49.430
<v Speaker 3>It was super cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I did not see that coming because </v>

1501
01:03:49.430 --> 01:03:51.681
<v Speaker 3>he just was really high energy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was self deprecating and the </v>

1502
01:03:51.681 --> 01:03:51.681
<v Speaker 3>interviews.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>

1503
01:03:51.681 --> 01:03:51.720
<v Speaker 3>it was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was really fun.</v>

1504
01:03:53.430 --> 01:03:58.430
<v Speaker 3>Going back to this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the reasons why I really wanted </v>

1505
01:03:58.430 --> 01:04:00.711
<v Speaker 3>to talk to you is because I think that </v>
<v Speaker 3>this is this trap of falling into any </v>

1506
01:04:01.081 --> 01:04:01.920
<v Speaker 3>ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1507
01:04:01.921 --> 01:04:05.760
<v Speaker 3>I know a lot of people that get really </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrapped up in right wing ideologies.</v>

1508
01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:09.120
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a trap and I think that </v>
<v Speaker 3>also this,</v>

1509
01:04:09.150 --> 01:04:13.260
<v Speaker 3>this tribal thing that we do attacking </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that aren't on that tribe,</v>

1510
01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:16.610
<v Speaker 3>it's a trap to him and you see it when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you get rewarded for it,</v>

1511
01:04:16.611 --> 01:04:21.611
<v Speaker 3>like Pz Myers as a whole career from it </v>
<v Speaker 3>attacking people and the other side </v>

1512
01:04:21.611 --> 01:04:25.200
<v Speaker 3>instead of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a way to get these ideas</v>

1513
01:04:25.201 --> 01:04:30.201
<v Speaker 3>across where you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to piss people off and </v>

1514
01:04:30.201 --> 01:04:30.720
<v Speaker 3>I don't think pissing people off is.</v>

1515
01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:35.720
<v Speaker 3>I think there's certain comfort to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's also people gravitate </v>

1516
01:04:36.151 --> 01:04:38.640
<v Speaker 3>towards you because they don't want you </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do that to them.</v>

1517
01:04:38.670 --> 01:04:40.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I know what I'm saying.</v>

1518
01:04:40.051 --> 01:04:41.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think everyone does that,</v>

1519
01:04:41.671 --> 01:04:42.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like pc,</v>

1520
01:04:42.850 --> 01:04:47.850
<v Speaker 3>pc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't been on twitter and for </v>

1521
01:04:47.850 --> 01:04:47.850
<v Speaker 3>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he was always really nice to me,</v>

1522
01:04:47.850 --> 01:04:50.511
<v Speaker 3>but the people he's also arguing against</v>
<v Speaker 3>her also kind of doing the same thing </v>

1523
01:04:50.511 --> 01:04:54.490
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had this fucking revelation today </v>

1524
01:04:54.490 --> 01:04:56.460
<v Speaker 3>coming into the studio when I was kind </v>
<v Speaker 3>of like worst case,</v>

1525
01:04:56.760 --> 01:04:57.930
<v Speaker 3>like battle planning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1526
01:04:57.960 --> 01:04:59.910
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what if he really hates something?</v>

1527
01:04:59.911 --> 01:05:01.050
<v Speaker 3>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we're gonna get into a fight,</v>

1528
01:05:01.051 --> 01:05:02.910
<v Speaker 3>and for the first time ever I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1529
01:05:02.911 --> 01:05:07.911
<v Speaker 3>I could listen to them and ask a </v>
<v Speaker 3>followup question like I could just </v>

1530
01:05:07.911 --> 01:05:09.270
<v Speaker 3>because that wasn't an option before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you have your.</v>

1531
01:05:09.390 --> 01:05:12.420
<v Speaker 3>Especially when you start going on MSNBC</v>
<v Speaker 3>and these news round tables,</v>

1532
01:05:12.570 --> 01:05:13.920
<v Speaker 3>no one asks questions.</v>

1533
01:05:14.010 --> 01:05:15.450
<v Speaker 3>No one goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you mean by that?</v>

1534
01:05:15.660 --> 01:05:19.240
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guys went on once and you were talking,</v>

1535
01:05:19.270 --> 01:05:21.670
<v Speaker 3>now this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is one time I actually got upset at</v>

1536
01:05:21.671 --> 01:05:23.440
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not upset at you,</v>

1537
01:05:23.441 --> 01:05:27.190
<v Speaker 3>but upset at the idea time to around the</v>
<v Speaker 3>eye.</v>

1538
01:05:27.191 --> 01:05:32.191
<v Speaker 3>You were going on after Charlie Hebdo </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you were saying that the cartoons </v>

1539
01:05:33.101 --> 01:05:38.101
<v Speaker 3>that they did was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were really racist and my thought </v>

1540
01:05:38.101 --> 01:05:38.950
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so fucking what you know.</v>

1541
01:05:38.951 --> 01:05:43.951
<v Speaker 3>Even if they were racist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these people got gunned down and killed </v>

1542
01:05:43.951 --> 01:05:45.160
<v Speaker 3>because of ridiculous religious </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideology.</v>

1543
01:05:45.190 --> 01:05:50.190
<v Speaker 3>This is what this is about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is about not being able to draw </v>

1544
01:05:50.190 --> 01:05:50.190
<v Speaker 3>Muhammad well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think that,</v>

1545
01:05:50.230 --> 01:05:54.750
<v Speaker 3>but you got wrapped up in this super </v>
<v Speaker 3>progressive like defense,</v>

1546
01:05:54.790 --> 01:05:59.790
<v Speaker 3>but you're also.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was so confusing to me because the </v>

1547
01:05:59.790 --> 01:06:04.531
<v Speaker 3>term Islamophobia is a very interesting </v>
<v Speaker 3>one to me because it's always used </v>

1548
01:06:04.531 --> 01:06:04.960
<v Speaker 3>essentially on the left.</v>

1549
01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:06.850
<v Speaker 3>It's very rarely used on the right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1550
01:06:07.570 --> 01:06:11.530
<v Speaker 3>And Islam promotes violence against </v>
<v Speaker 3>women.</v>

1551
01:06:11.730 --> 01:06:12.660
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is,</v>

1552
01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:15.410
<v Speaker 3>it's very.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In terms of like,</v>

1553
01:06:15.490 --> 01:06:17.860
<v Speaker 3>it's suppression of women's rights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1554
01:06:17.861 --> 01:06:18.240
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1555
01:06:18.290 --> 01:06:21.100
<v Speaker 3>it's very ancient.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's ideas.</v>

1556
01:06:21.101 --> 01:06:24.550
<v Speaker 3>Most religions do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is a very uniquely suppressive one.</v>

1557
01:06:24.730 --> 01:06:26.830
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you actually take the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Bible literally.</v>

1558
01:06:26.890 --> 01:06:29.170
<v Speaker 3>Did you know that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the Old Testament,</v>

1559
01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:34.560
<v Speaker 3>the Old Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the selling your daughter into </v>

1560
01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:37.261
<v Speaker 3>prostitution when they're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone who is literally taking that </v>

1561
01:06:37.331 --> 01:06:41.890
<v Speaker 3>version of it in practice and killing </v>
<v Speaker 3>cartoonists for drawing Muhammad.</v>

1562
01:06:41.910 --> 01:06:46.910
<v Speaker 3>So here's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's what I think you should be able </v>

1563
01:06:46.910 --> 01:06:46.910
<v Speaker 3>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's what I've been trying to do,</v>

1564
01:06:46.910 --> 01:06:48.370
<v Speaker 3>where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand why you can't go,</v>

1565
01:06:48.940 --> 01:06:51.550
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why you can't go racist.</v>

1566
01:06:51.551 --> 01:06:52.860
<v Speaker 3>Cartoons are bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1567
01:06:52.930 --> 01:06:56.290
<v Speaker 3>And hacky killing them is worse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1568
01:06:56.320 --> 01:06:58.210
<v Speaker 3>You shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't kill people.</v>

1569
01:06:58.450 --> 01:07:00.410
<v Speaker 3>Or if you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1570
01:07:00.460 --> 01:07:01.980
<v Speaker 3>that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1571
01:07:02.350 --> 01:07:07.350
<v Speaker 3>Islamophobia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>racism against Arab people who you're </v>

1572
01:07:07.841 --> 01:07:12.841
<v Speaker 3>just going to assume are all Muslim and </v>
<v Speaker 3>not just all regrets about Islam,</v>

1573
01:07:12.881 --> 01:07:17.881
<v Speaker 3>but exactly all like except same </v>
<v Speaker 3>versions of that homophobic that's bad.</v>

1574
01:07:18.850 --> 01:07:22.900
<v Speaker 3>But being sexist in the name of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>religion is also bad.</v>

1575
01:07:22.901 --> 01:07:27.901
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think this is what you were </v>

1576
01:07:27.901 --> 01:07:27.901
<v Speaker 3>talking about where it comes down to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1577
01:07:27.901 --> 01:07:31.831
<v Speaker 3>you got to pick a side deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's either everybody's racist or every </v>

1578
01:07:31.831 --> 01:07:34.790
<v Speaker 3>Muslim is a murder and it's like you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't have to pick a side and,</v>

1579
01:07:35.020 --> 01:07:40.020
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and post this fallout when I've been </v>

1580
01:07:40.020 --> 01:07:40.020
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1581
01:07:40.020 --> 01:07:44.520
<v Speaker 3>here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been healthier than I've ever been </v>

1582
01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:44.520
<v Speaker 3>in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1583
01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:48.270
<v Speaker 3>my girlfriend is fucking wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wake up at like five and I meditate </v>

1584
01:07:48.270 --> 01:07:49.450
<v Speaker 3>and like Jiu Jitsu saved my fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

1585
01:07:49.460 --> 01:07:53.800
<v Speaker 3>This literally saved my life this year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm at being off twitter.</v>

1586
01:07:53.801 --> 01:07:56.470
<v Speaker 3>Being off social media has been fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>great.</v>

1587
01:07:56.500 --> 01:07:59.290
<v Speaker 3>It's been incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And getting to hear,</v>

1588
01:07:59.410 --> 01:08:01.210
<v Speaker 3>like getting to listen to Sam Harris' </v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast,</v>

1589
01:08:01.211 --> 01:08:06.211
<v Speaker 3>getting to listen to your podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hearing both you guys say like really </v>

1590
01:08:06.211 --> 01:08:06.880
<v Speaker 3>progressive things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think people know that,</v>

1591
01:08:07.020 --> 01:08:12.020
<v Speaker 3>but I think they do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you were just in an echo </v>

1592
01:08:12.020 --> 01:08:12.020
<v Speaker 3>chamber,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>

1593
01:08:12.020 --> 01:08:12.760
<v Speaker 3>Well I think if you don't listen to what</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're saying is side.</v>

1594
01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:13.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the thing.</v>

1595
01:08:14.020 --> 01:08:16.160
<v Speaker 3>No one's running either side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1596
01:08:16.190 --> 01:08:17.630
<v Speaker 4>this is what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not,</v>

1597
01:08:17.690 --> 01:08:19.150
<v Speaker 4>it's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1598
01:08:19.180 --> 01:08:24.180
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it sounds like it's the dolphins versus </v>

1599
01:08:24.180 --> 01:08:24.180
<v Speaker 4>the raiders.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1600
01:08:24.180 --> 01:08:28.740
<v Speaker 4>like one team has very clear outfits and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're trying to move the ball across </v>

1601
01:08:28.740 --> 01:08:29.400
<v Speaker 4>this line.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1602
01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:30.740
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what any of those words </v>
<v Speaker 4>meant,</v>

1603
01:08:30.770 --> 01:08:31.760
<v Speaker 4>but I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I'm saying?</v>

1604
01:08:31.761 --> 01:08:35.240
<v Speaker 4>I really barely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I barely do no fighting,</v>

1605
01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:38.240
<v Speaker 4>but the idea is that these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these sides,</v>

1606
01:08:38.380 --> 01:08:43.380
<v Speaker 4>they're very fluid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're moving around all the time and </v>

1607
01:08:43.380 --> 01:08:46.870
<v Speaker 4>they solidify with resistance and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>think when people hear middle or middle </v>

1608
01:08:47.241 --> 01:08:52.241
<v Speaker 4>ground,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they always see that as wishy washy or </v>

1609
01:08:52.241 --> 01:08:52.241
<v Speaker 4>you're not taking aside.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1610
01:08:52.241 --> 01:08:52.241
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I.</v>

1611
01:08:52.241 --> 01:08:55.790
<v Speaker 4>But I feel like there is still,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's good middle ground,</v>

1612
01:08:55.791 --> 01:08:56.710
<v Speaker 4>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1613
01:08:56.720 --> 01:09:01.720
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the racism slash jihadism is really </v>

1614
01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:01.720
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1615
01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:03.860
<v Speaker 4>You can say that both are bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can say the jihadism is bad.</v>

1616
01:09:03.860 --> 01:09:05.810
<v Speaker 4>You can say the fucking profiling </v>
<v Speaker 4>Muslims is bad.</v>

1617
01:09:05.811 --> 01:09:08.510
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what's so fucking hard </v>
<v Speaker 4>about saying those things,</v>

1618
01:09:08.540 --> 01:09:13.540
<v Speaker 4>but also in an attacking all Muslims,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you are doing is solidifying their </v>

1619
01:09:14.511 --> 01:09:19.511
<v Speaker 4>position as well and you're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're making it very hard for them to </v>

1620
01:09:19.511 --> 01:09:23.830
<v Speaker 4>look.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All religions at one point in time were </v>

1621
01:09:23.830 --> 01:09:27.131
<v Speaker 4>extremely rigid and like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you go back to the early days of </v>

1622
01:09:27.131 --> 01:09:27.500
<v Speaker 4>Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go back to the inquisition.</v>

1623
01:09:27.510 --> 01:09:32.510
<v Speaker 4>Mean they did some fucking unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 4>horrific things in the name of God in </v>

1624
01:09:32.510 --> 01:09:34.640
<v Speaker 4>the name of Christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

1625
01:09:34.641 --> 01:09:39.641
<v Speaker 4>if you look at where the more moderate </v>
<v Speaker 4>Muslims are today,</v>

1626
01:09:39.970 --> 01:09:42.590
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's people that are reformers</v>

1627
01:09:42.620 --> 01:09:47.620
<v Speaker 4>that are still,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's still considered themselves most </v>

1628
01:09:47.620 --> 01:09:47.620
<v Speaker 4>of their grant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1629
01:09:47.620 --> 01:09:47.620
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1630
01:09:47.620 --> 01:09:48.240
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's a ton.</v>

1631
01:09:48.700 --> 01:09:52.280
<v Speaker 4>I had Hirsi Ali I guess is not no longer</v>
<v Speaker 4>considers himself a Muslim,</v>

1632
01:09:52.281 --> 01:09:56.450
<v Speaker 4>but Majid does mentioned wanting a lot </v>
<v Speaker 4>of them who consider themselves Muslims,</v>

1633
01:09:56.451 --> 01:09:59.750
<v Speaker 4>but they're moving towards a more </v>
<v Speaker 4>progressive ideology.</v>

1634
01:10:00.050 --> 01:10:01.760
<v Speaker 4>This,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is possible,</v>

1635
01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:05.510
<v Speaker 4>but it's only possible if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're not attacking,</v>

1636
01:10:05.830 --> 01:10:09.530
<v Speaker 4>see if you attack.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then the more radical of that base,</v>

1637
01:10:09.710 --> 01:10:14.060
<v Speaker 4>they they lean to that and they lean to </v>
<v Speaker 4>reinforcing their team.</v>

1638
01:10:14.090 --> 01:10:19.090
<v Speaker 4>Well not only the more radical,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but even just the younger ones where if </v>

1639
01:10:19.090 --> 01:10:22.871
<v Speaker 4>you are a 16 year old Muslim kid in </v>
<v Speaker 4>America and you immigrated here because </v>

1640
01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:28.600
<v Speaker 4>your fucking family got bombed in Iraq </v>
<v Speaker 4>or Syria or wherever by us and now </v>

1641
01:10:28.911 --> 01:10:31.880
<v Speaker 4>you're being profiled and being called </v>
<v Speaker 4>racist names here.</v>

1642
01:10:31.881 --> 01:10:34.420
<v Speaker 4>It's like that's how you make extremist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

1643
01:10:34.550 --> 01:10:37.460
<v Speaker 4>and so it's not only as the racism </v>
<v Speaker 4>racist,</v>

1644
01:10:37.461 --> 01:10:40.010
<v Speaker 4>but it's also fucking counterproductive </v>
<v Speaker 4>and a lot of ways.</v>

1645
01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:41.330
<v Speaker 4>A great way to put it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1646
01:10:41.331 --> 01:10:44.360
<v Speaker 4>It's like you are all these wars that we</v>
<v Speaker 4>say we're doing to defeat Islam.</v>

1647
01:10:44.361 --> 01:10:49.361
<v Speaker 4>They're also creating a fuck load of </v>
<v Speaker 4>extremists who maybe would have been </v>

1648
01:10:49.361 --> 01:10:49.361
<v Speaker 4>moderate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but now their houses in a rebel,</v>

1649
01:10:49.361 --> 01:10:50.720
<v Speaker 4>they don't have jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1650
01:10:50.780 --> 01:10:51.920
<v Speaker 4>One hundred percent and they're just </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1651
01:10:51.921 --> 01:10:56.921
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to avenge my family and this </v>

1652
01:10:56.921 --> 01:10:56.921
<v Speaker 4>dude says I got to go to heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So fuck yeah,</v>

1653
01:10:56.921 --> 01:10:58.010
<v Speaker 4>and this ideology and this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this point of view,</v>

1654
01:10:58.090 --> 01:11:03.090
<v Speaker 4>it's applicable to this whole team </v>
<v Speaker 4>mentality that we do with right versus </v>

1655
01:11:03.090 --> 01:11:05.030
<v Speaker 4>left as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that in attacking,</v>

1656
01:11:05.420 --> 01:11:09.140
<v Speaker 4>instead of explaining the positive </v>
<v Speaker 4>aspects of your positions,</v>

1657
01:11:09.650 --> 01:11:14.010
<v Speaker 4>attacking the other positions and </v>
<v Speaker 4>attacking an ad hominem attacks on</v>

1658
01:11:14.010 --> 01:11:16.590
<v Speaker 3>these people and attacking their </v>
<v Speaker 3>structure,</v>

1659
01:11:16.710 --> 01:11:19.410
<v Speaker 3>who they are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>attacking them as racist,</v>

1660
01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:20.820
<v Speaker 3>sexist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>homophobic,</v>

1661
01:11:21.060 --> 01:11:26.060
<v Speaker 3>instead of reinforcing the very positive</v>
<v Speaker 3>aspects of live and let live about being</v>

1662
01:11:27.751 --> 01:11:31.950
<v Speaker 3>open minded and being legitimately </v>
<v Speaker 3>progressive progress.</v>

1663
01:11:32.010 --> 01:11:37.010
<v Speaker 3>You totally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that one of the things that </v>

1664
01:11:37.010 --> 01:11:39.081
<v Speaker 3>I know I did and everyone I followed on </v>
<v Speaker 3>twitter did in sort of the progressive </v>

1665
01:11:39.081 --> 01:11:40.290
<v Speaker 3>world as you would like try to out </v>
<v Speaker 3>progressive each other.</v>

1666
01:11:40.291 --> 01:11:45.291
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like somebody has a progressive </v>

1667
01:11:45.291 --> 01:11:45.291
<v Speaker 3>take on the news.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do I make it like,</v>

1668
01:11:45.291 --> 01:11:45.291
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

1669
01:11:45.291 --> 01:11:47.730
<v Speaker 3>when same sex marriage became legal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people be like,</v>

1670
01:11:47.731 --> 01:11:50.130
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well tell that to the People Bama drone.</v>

1671
01:11:50.131 --> 01:11:55.131
<v Speaker 3>It's like fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can we just be happy about like one </v>

1672
01:11:55.131 --> 01:11:56.520
<v Speaker 3>thing or it's like they're finding ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like everyone likes cory booker.</v>

1673
01:11:56.521 --> 01:11:58.830
<v Speaker 3>What can I find that cory booker did </v>
<v Speaker 3>that was like fucked up?</v>

1674
01:11:59.540 --> 01:12:00.450
<v Speaker 3>Or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1675
01:12:00.451 --> 01:12:03.180
<v Speaker 3>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like you gave another example,</v>

1676
01:12:03.181 --> 01:12:05.370
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1677
01:12:05.870 --> 01:12:07.740
<v Speaker 3>I mean that just happened with rose </v>
<v Speaker 3>McGowan a little bit,</v>

1678
01:12:07.741 --> 01:12:07.970
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1679
01:12:07.980 --> 01:12:12.980
<v Speaker 3>Like she did this really brave thing but</v>
<v Speaker 3>coming out against Harvey Weinstein and </v>

1680
01:12:12.980 --> 01:12:17.121
<v Speaker 3>then people are calling it like white </v>
<v Speaker 3>lady feminism and it's like the left is </v>

1681
01:12:17.121 --> 01:12:21.351
<v Speaker 3>never going to win if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't let the rape survivor come </v>

1682
01:12:21.351 --> 01:12:24.660
<v Speaker 3>forward without attacking her for not </v>
<v Speaker 3>being raped progressively enough.</v>

1683
01:12:24.690 --> 01:12:26.040
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's nuts.</v>

1684
01:12:26.340 --> 01:12:31.340
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think that's one of the biggest </v>

1685
01:12:31.340 --> 01:12:33.681
<v Speaker 3>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's trying to be the best </v>

1686
01:12:33.681 --> 01:12:33.681
<v Speaker 3>example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1687
01:12:33.681 --> 01:12:37.850
<v Speaker 3>The best example of being progressive </v>
<v Speaker 3>and shit on someone who's less </v>

1688
01:12:37.850 --> 01:12:37.850
<v Speaker 3>progressive than you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1689
01:12:37.850 --> 01:12:39.130
<v Speaker 3>Or the most depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1690
01:12:39.250 --> 01:12:44.250
<v Speaker 3>And ramp up the radical aspects of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>progressive and the most depressed is </v>

1691
01:12:44.250 --> 01:12:46.650
<v Speaker 3>that we were saying the most oppressed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like for like a white guy like me,</v>

1692
01:12:46.651 --> 01:12:48.750
<v Speaker 3>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I'm not oppressed.</v>

1693
01:12:48.751 --> 01:12:53.751
<v Speaker 3>I'm not gonna start calling myself like </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying your Kilstein like I'm going to </v>

1694
01:12:53.751 --> 01:12:54.690
<v Speaker 3>be the ally so I'm not oppressed.</v>

1695
01:12:54.690 --> 01:12:59.690
<v Speaker 3>Because twitter was a great tool and is </v>
<v Speaker 3>a great tool where we wouldn't have had </v>

1696
01:12:59.690 --> 01:13:02.610
<v Speaker 3>a lot of like really big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think social justice victories without</v>

1697
01:13:02.611 --> 01:13:05.280
<v Speaker 3>twitter and it became a really good like</v>
<v Speaker 3>which ones?</v>

1698
01:13:05.340 --> 01:13:10.340
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it became a good watchdog for </v>

1699
01:13:10.340 --> 01:13:10.340
<v Speaker 3>the police violence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1700
01:13:10.340 --> 01:13:12.690
<v Speaker 3>And specifically twitter and not just </v>
<v Speaker 3>all social media in general.</v>

1701
01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:15.340
<v Speaker 3>Do you think facebook is more of an echo</v>
<v Speaker 3>chamber?</v>

1702
01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:17.010
<v Speaker 3>Like what do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Facebook?</v>

1703
01:13:17.011 --> 01:13:20.220
<v Speaker 3>I kind of just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean at least for me a facebook goes a</v>

1704
01:13:20.221 --> 01:13:23.880
<v Speaker 3>little slower and I mainly follow just </v>
<v Speaker 3>friends on facebook,</v>

1705
01:13:23.881 --> 01:13:25.740
<v Speaker 3>but I guess you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess facebook and twitter,</v>

1706
01:13:25.741 --> 01:13:30.741
<v Speaker 3>social media.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the problem with facebook is </v>

1707
01:13:30.741 --> 01:13:30.741
<v Speaker 3>that people have the opportunity to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>too verbose.</v>

1708
01:13:30.741 --> 01:13:35.270
<v Speaker 3>They can write these gigantic long </v>
<v Speaker 3>screens and no one's going to fucking </v>

1709
01:13:35.270 --> 01:13:38.961
<v Speaker 3>read it anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You give people too much of an </v>

1710
01:13:38.961 --> 01:13:38.961
<v Speaker 3>opportunity to be self indulgent.</v>

1711
01:13:38.961 --> 01:13:40.440
<v Speaker 3>That's all I did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all it is.</v>

1712
01:13:40.740 --> 01:13:42.750
<v Speaker 3>And then you just see it and you see a </v>
<v Speaker 3>word,</v>

1713
01:13:42.751 --> 01:13:44.640
<v Speaker 3>like you see a word like racism and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>

1714
01:13:44.641 --> 01:13:49.641
<v Speaker 3>I guess I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I Guess I like it because I don't want </v>

1715
01:13:49.641 --> 01:13:51.441
<v Speaker 3>to not like the big racism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then you also become item read </v>

1716
01:13:51.441 --> 01:13:55.911
<v Speaker 3>fucking articles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If the progressive person I knew shared </v>

1717
01:13:55.911 --> 01:13:56.460
<v Speaker 3>an article and the headline looked good </v>
<v Speaker 3>enough,</v>

1718
01:13:56.610 --> 01:13:59.490
<v Speaker 3>I would share the article and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the shit that happened to me.</v>

1719
01:13:59.730 --> 01:14:00.750
<v Speaker 3>How backfired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where I'm like,</v>

1720
01:14:00.751 --> 01:14:03.120
<v Speaker 3>how many people are actually reading </v>
<v Speaker 3>these fucking articles?</v>

1721
01:14:03.121 --> 01:14:08.121
<v Speaker 3>Reading the articles that say we could </v>
<v Speaker 3>not find that quote or we can not find </v>

1722
01:14:08.121 --> 01:14:09.330
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So all this shit went down.</v>

1723
01:14:09.331 --> 01:14:12.190
<v Speaker 3>Jessebelle writes an article about you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some other people write articles about</v>

1724
01:14:12.190 --> 01:14:14.140
<v Speaker 4>you and you just dropped off the face of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the earth.</v>

1725
01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:15.880
<v Speaker 4>So I just figured,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck this.</v>

1726
01:14:15.881 --> 01:14:16.960
<v Speaker 4>I'm deleting my twitter.</v>

1727
01:14:17.030 --> 01:14:17.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1728
01:14:17.561 --> 01:14:18.620
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I assumed.</v>

1729
01:14:18.980 --> 01:14:19.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could say.</v>

1730
01:14:19.881 --> 01:14:24.881
<v Speaker 2>Part of me didn't say anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Part of me didn't say anything because </v>

1731
01:14:24.881 --> 01:14:25.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I no longer.</v>

1732
01:14:25.330 --> 01:14:28.250
<v Speaker 2>I have to be a real person now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't do shows anymore.</v>

1733
01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:30.750
<v Speaker 2>So why did you say that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>B?</v>

1734
01:14:31.610 --> 01:14:36.610
<v Speaker 2>Just because I felt like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only world I knew completely was </v>

1735
01:14:36.610 --> 01:14:37.380
<v Speaker 2>crashing down and calling me things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't.</v>

1736
01:14:37.770 --> 01:14:42.770
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I already sort of burned comedy and </v>

1737
01:14:42.770 --> 01:14:44.180
<v Speaker 2>this is one I don't understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I don't,</v>

1738
01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:45.410
<v Speaker 2>I don't see</v>

1739
01:14:45.810 --> 01:14:48.280
<v Speaker 4>big accusation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll see them saying</v>

1740
01:14:48.570 --> 01:14:53.570
<v Speaker 2>fuck girls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's what happens is in my world </v>

1741
01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:57.740
<v Speaker 2>and former world pre,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1742
01:14:58.310 --> 01:15:01.130
<v Speaker 2>Weinstein and like this is what real </v>
<v Speaker 2>predators look like.</v>

1743
01:15:01.131 --> 01:15:04.040
<v Speaker 2>It was just fun to go after him and to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go after me.</v>

1744
01:15:04.580 --> 01:15:05.750
<v Speaker 2>But also,</v>

1745
01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:08.400
<v Speaker 4>so as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you had sort of set up</v>

1746
01:15:08.510 --> 01:15:09.730
<v Speaker 2>rotted out myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1747
01:15:09.820 --> 01:15:11.800
<v Speaker 2>And so my girlfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it happened,</v>

1748
01:15:11.801 --> 01:15:16.801
<v Speaker 2>my girlfriend was out of town.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I totally assumed she was breaking up </v>

1749
01:15:16.801 --> 01:15:19.540
<v Speaker 2>with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm in La and like,</v>

1750
01:15:19.650 --> 01:15:20.650
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my little apartment,</v>

1751
01:15:20.651 --> 01:15:22.060
<v Speaker 2>my cat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my girlfriend,</v>

1752
01:15:22.061 --> 01:15:24.490
<v Speaker 2>I assume has gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My family's talking to me,</v>

1753
01:15:24.550 --> 01:15:26.500
<v Speaker 2>which is great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But none of my friends.</v>

1754
01:15:26.501 --> 01:15:30.050
<v Speaker 2>Here's something I'll say this about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is one of the reasons I came back.</v>

1755
01:15:30.051 --> 01:15:32.150
<v Speaker 2>The comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1756
01:15:32.170 --> 01:15:32.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>besides,</v>

1757
01:15:32.651 --> 01:15:37.651
<v Speaker 2>I always loved it and I missed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the only fucking people that </v>

1758
01:15:37.651 --> 01:15:42.211
<v Speaker 2>reached out to see if I was okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're comics comics who I hadn't talked </v>

1759
01:15:42.211 --> 01:15:43.540
<v Speaker 2>to in years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None of the progressive journalists,</v>

1760
01:15:43.541 --> 01:15:47.560
<v Speaker 2>none of the people who knew about </v>
<v Speaker 2>depression or suicide or whatever.</v>

1761
01:15:47.910 --> 01:15:52.910
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know if they read the </v>

1762
01:15:52.910 --> 01:15:52.910
<v Speaker 2>fucking article like or if they just saw</v>
<v Speaker 2>that word and was like,</v>

1763
01:15:52.910 --> 01:15:55.480
<v Speaker 2>I will get in trouble if I mean Jim </v>
<v Speaker 2>Norton who I.</v>

1764
01:15:55.481 --> 01:16:00.481
<v Speaker 2>I knew when I was 22,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I probably asked him if I could do a </v>

1765
01:16:00.481 --> 01:16:03.301
<v Speaker 2>guest spot for him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like the stress factory wrote me to </v>

1766
01:16:03.301 --> 01:16:04.030
<v Speaker 2>see if I was okay like you wrote me a </v>
<v Speaker 2>really nice email.</v>

1767
01:16:04.210 --> 01:16:08.800
<v Speaker 2>Stan hope wrote me a couple of times to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make sure I was okay and prevents a wow.</v>

1768
01:16:08.820 --> 01:16:12.100
<v Speaker 2>It was comics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>comics,</v>

1769
01:16:12.300 --> 01:16:14.380
<v Speaker 2>real comics realize that we're all </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucked up</v>

1770
01:16:14.870 --> 01:16:17.780
<v Speaker 4>and I didn't go down your road,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if I was in your shoes,</v>

1771
01:16:17.781 --> 01:16:22.781
<v Speaker 4>I might've walked on your road.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very possible and to say that you </v>

1772
01:16:22.781 --> 01:16:22.781
<v Speaker 4>couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would never be in that position.</v>

1773
01:16:22.781 --> 01:16:24.110
<v Speaker 4>I would never do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would never say those things.</v>

1774
01:16:24.111 --> 01:16:25.640
<v Speaker 4>That's disingenuous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not true.</v>

1775
01:16:25.670 --> 01:16:26.500
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1776
01:16:26.501 --> 01:16:27.110
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't.</v>

1777
01:16:27.170 --> 01:16:29.750
<v Speaker 4>I didn't grow up in your house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't live your life.</v>

1778
01:16:29.751 --> 01:16:31.670
<v Speaker 4>I don't have your experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your genetics,</v>

1779
01:16:31.671 --> 01:16:32.230

<v Speaker 4>your,</v>

1780
01:16:32.231 --> 01:16:33.770
<v Speaker 4>your environment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't have those things.</v>

1781
01:16:33.980 --> 01:16:36.170
<v Speaker 4>If I did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I easily could have gone down your road.</v>

1782
01:16:36.390 --> 01:16:41.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know that definitely months </v>

1783
01:16:41.390 --> 01:16:46.160

<v Speaker 2>just reached out to thank him and I said</v>

1784
01:16:46.591 --> 01:16:47.730
<v Speaker 2>something that made him laugh and he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Was literally a to do know.</v>

1813
01:17:51.770 --> 01:17:54.400

<v Speaker 3>the first website that comes up is,</v>

1814
01:17:54.450 --> 01:17:55.190
<v Speaker 3>it's a lie.</v>

1815
01:17:55.370 --> 01:18:00.370
<v Speaker 3>It's they say like easiest way to kill </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself and then you click it and it's </v>

<v Speaker 3>Should we all do it together?</v>

1852
01:19:06.980 --> 01:19:08.000
<v Speaker 3>We could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1855
01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:14.750
<v Speaker 3>I will have to commercial freezers back </v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

1856
01:19:15.150 --> 01:19:16.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this place is fucking insane.</v>

1857
01:19:16.851 --> 01:19:17.680
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1858
01:19:17.750 --> 01:19:19.860
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Needed a fun house.</v>

1859
01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:24.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm so excited for like the mats that </v>
<v Speaker 3>comes this weekend.</v>

1860
01:19:24.710 --> 01:19:26.930
<v Speaker 3>Does it to this fucking great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1861
01:19:26.931 --> 01:19:30.260
<v Speaker 3>so this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this whole journey that you've been on,</v>

1862
01:19:30.261 --> 01:19:35.261
<v Speaker 3>and this is again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the reasons why I want you to </v>

1863
01:19:35.261 --> 01:19:37.811
<v Speaker 3>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we can all learn something from </v>

1864
01:19:37.811 --> 01:19:40.031
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope both communities learn something </v>

1865
01:19:40.031 --> 01:19:40.130
<v Speaker 3>from it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean maybe it's wishful thinking on my</v>

1866
01:19:40.131 --> 01:19:42.220
<v Speaker 3>part,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I really think like we,</v>

1867
01:19:42.980 --> 01:19:47.980
<v Speaker 3>this idea of right versus left is so god</v>
<v Speaker 3>damn crazy and we have more common </v>

1868
01:19:47.980 --> 01:19:52.541
<v Speaker 3>ground and we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think reasonable people think all </v>

1869
01:19:52.541 --> 01:19:56.291
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these core tenants that we were just </v>

1870
01:19:56.291 --> 01:19:58.340
<v Speaker 3>talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we think that we're egalitarianism.</v>

1871
01:19:58.341 --> 01:20:01.790
<v Speaker 3>I think that women should be treated </v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly the same way as men.</v>

1872
01:20:01.791 --> 01:20:03.920
<v Speaker 3>That you should be judged by your </v>
<v Speaker 3>character.</v>

1873
01:20:03.921 --> 01:20:07.560
<v Speaker 3>You shouldn't be judged by the color of </v>
<v Speaker 3>your skin or where are you from?</v>

1874
01:20:07.561 --> 01:20:07.910
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1875
01:20:07.990 --> 01:20:10.680
<v Speaker 4>how did the people that I know that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>cool people we have,</v>

1876
01:20:11.130 --> 01:20:13.470
<v Speaker 4>we have black friends,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have Asian friends.</v>

1877
01:20:13.471 --> 01:20:15.360
<v Speaker 4>We don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Especially in the world of comedy,</v>

1878
01:20:15.361 --> 01:20:20.361
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the only currency that you carry around </v>

1879
01:20:20.361 --> 01:20:20.361
<v Speaker 4>is your personality and whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're good,</v>

1880
01:20:20.370 --> 01:20:25.370
<v Speaker 4>whether you're funny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether you work hard and when you're </v>

1881
01:20:25.370 --> 01:20:25.380
<v Speaker 4>around people that are funny and work </v>
<v Speaker 4>hard,</v>

1882
01:20:25.410 --> 01:20:26.790
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those people are fuel</v>

1883
01:20:26.970 --> 01:20:28.440
<v Speaker 3>cute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're inspirational.</v>

1884
01:20:28.530 --> 01:20:29.340
<v Speaker 3>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1885
01:20:29.430 --> 01:20:33.480
<v Speaker 3>and I'll say this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I was not a good person.</v>

1886
01:20:34.140 --> 01:20:39.140
<v Speaker 3>I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least to the standard that I would </v>

1887
01:20:39.140 --> 01:20:42.141
<v Speaker 3>like to hold myself when I was just like</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrapped up into this world and we were </v>

1888
01:20:42.141 --> 01:20:43.210
<v Speaker 3>very.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1889
01:20:43.211 --> 01:20:44.520
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am flawed.</v>

1890
01:20:44.730 --> 01:20:49.730
<v Speaker 3>We all are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you are using a flawed operating </v>

1891
01:20:49.730 --> 01:20:49.730
<v Speaker 3>system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1892
01:20:49.730 --> 01:20:49.730
<v Speaker 3>And also like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was just,</v>

1893
01:20:49.730 --> 01:20:51.570
<v Speaker 3>I was just desperately searching for </v>
<v Speaker 3>validation.</v>

1894
01:20:51.571 --> 01:20:54.240
<v Speaker 3>I was very selfish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was really depressed.</v>

1895
01:20:54.450 --> 01:20:57.320
<v Speaker 3>And ever since this happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1896
01:20:57.630 --> 01:20:59.490
<v Speaker 3>I don't fuck him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have not watched.</v>

1897
01:20:59.550 --> 01:21:01.500
<v Speaker 3>I barely watch the news when people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1898
01:21:01.501 --> 01:21:02.830
<v Speaker 3>trump called North Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gay.</v>

1899
01:21:02.831 --> 01:21:03.690
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

1900
01:21:03.720 --> 01:21:05.010
<v Speaker 3>not to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I don't want,</v>

1901
01:21:05.011 --> 01:21:07.320
<v Speaker 3>I don't watch that shit anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just stepped back.</v>

1902
01:21:07.350 --> 01:21:10.140
<v Speaker 3>I totally stepped back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but ever since I sold a year.</v>

1903
01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:11.220
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1904
01:21:11.850 --> 01:21:13.890
<v Speaker 3>but I mean it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying this right now,</v>

1905
01:21:13.891 --> 01:21:14.940
<v Speaker 3>like I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1906
01:21:14.941 --> 01:21:16.470
<v Speaker 3>I'm just like walking the roads.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1908
01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:21.380
<v Speaker 3>in the first I forgot about him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You ever want to come through?</v>

1909
01:21:21.381 --> 01:21:23.520
<v Speaker 3>The legend continues not as popular.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1910
01:21:23.550 --> 01:21:25.380
<v Speaker 3>I fucked them quite as good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1911
01:21:25.820 --> 01:21:27.930
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was like different times.</v>

1912
01:21:27.960 --> 01:21:28.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like,</v>

1913
01:21:29.110 --> 01:21:30.240
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was still,</v>

1914
01:21:30.241 --> 01:21:32.490
<v Speaker 3>it was modern day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was still quite Chang Caine,</v>

1915
01:21:32.491 --> 01:21:34.620
<v Speaker 3>but his son was like a street cop if </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the fucking.</v>

1916
01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:36.390
<v Speaker 3>It was the best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so good.</v>

1917
01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:39.180
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1918
01:21:39.181 --> 01:21:43.320
<v Speaker 3>So the first year that kind of died with</v>
<v Speaker 3>a dildo possess a hanging by his neck.</v>

1919
01:21:43.330 --> 01:21:44.460
<v Speaker 3>Graduate Ham.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>that uh,</v>

1921
01:21:46.110 --> 01:21:46.880
<v Speaker 3>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was,</v>

1922
01:21:46.920 --> 01:21:49.320
<v Speaker 3>that was not on the list of suicide </v>
<v Speaker 3>options that I looked up.</v>

1923
01:21:49.350 --> 01:21:54.350
<v Speaker 3>They'll know in the ass hanging.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They think that he might've done </v>

1924
01:21:54.350 --> 01:21:57.711
<v Speaker 3>something to piss off tie gangsters </v>
<v Speaker 3>because he died in Thailand and he died </v>

1925
01:21:58.250 --> 01:22:01.470
<v Speaker 3>like what would be considered either a </v>
<v Speaker 3>shameful way.</v>

1926
01:22:01.500 --> 01:22:06.500
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was auto erotic comics fixation was </v>

1927
01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:06.600
<v Speaker 3>what they listed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what I've heard is,</v>

1928
01:22:06.810 --> 01:22:08.460
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that means nothing,</v>

1929
01:22:08.790 --> 01:22:13.790
<v Speaker 3>but what I have heard is that there are </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that consider the possibility </v>

1930
01:22:13.790 --> 01:22:18.651
<v Speaker 3>that he was murdered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the craziest Shit I've ever </v>

1931
01:22:18.651 --> 01:22:18.651
<v Speaker 3>heard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1932
01:22:18.651 --> 01:22:20.520
<v Speaker 3>and put them in a wetsuit and shoved a </v>
<v Speaker 3>dildo up his ass and we'll look.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I can't complain about my life anymore.</v>

1934
01:22:22.560 --> 01:22:25.110
<v Speaker 3>I didn't have a dildo shoved up my ass </v>
<v Speaker 3>by ty gangsters.</v>

1935
01:22:25.170 --> 01:22:27.300
<v Speaker 3>Apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't a nice guy really.</v>

1936
01:22:27.660 --> 01:22:29.370
<v Speaker 3>Well that host,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like taking the show from Bruce.</v>

1937
01:22:29.371 --> 01:22:30.780

<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1938
01:22:30.781 --> 01:22:33.160
<v Speaker 3>but like what companies like Bruce Lee </v>
<v Speaker 3>that was present,</v>

1939
01:22:33.270 --> 01:22:34.950
<v Speaker 3>he was probably just an actor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

01:22:34.980 --> 01:22:36.870
<v Speaker 3>I just like his people.</v>

01:22:36.920 --> 01:22:39.150
<v Speaker 3>And nobody knew who he was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like no one knew who he was.</v>

1942
01:22:39.151 --> 01:22:39.930
<v Speaker 3>He had zero power.</v>

1943
01:22:39.930 --> 01:22:40.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's very true.</v>

1944

01:23:06.460 --> 01:23:08.480
<v Speaker 2>You're owning that as like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a part of your,</v>

1956
01:23:08.481 --> 01:23:10.690
<v Speaker 2>your person when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you do this.</v>

1957
01:23:11.050 --> 01:23:16.050
<v Speaker 2>And to a certain extent I have to write </v>
<v Speaker 2>like if I meet with like an agent like </v>

1958
01:23:16.050 --> 01:23:17.440
<v Speaker 2>and they google it and they don't read </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1959
01:23:17.441 --> 01:23:19.720
<v Speaker 2>it looks fucking shady.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

1960
01:23:19.900 --> 01:23:24.900
<v Speaker 2>but it looks shady and all people do is </v>
<v Speaker 2>they google and they look at a headline </v>

1961
01:23:24.900 --> 01:23:24.900
<v Speaker 2>and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh fuck that.</v>

1962
01:23:24.900 --> 01:23:25.630
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be around that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1963
01:23:26.440 --> 01:23:29.500
<v Speaker 2>But for the second six months or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

1964
01:23:30.130 --> 01:23:32.620
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I've been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My family is like,</v>

1965
01:23:32.621 --> 01:23:35.020
<v Speaker 2>this is the most present and </v>
<v Speaker 2>communicative you've been.</v>

1966
01:23:35.290 --> 01:23:38.080
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I've been a better friend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my Jujitsu a skyrocket.</v>

1967
01:23:38.081 --> 01:23:40.090
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I have a family at my </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu school.</v>

1968
01:23:40.100 --> 01:23:43.240
<v Speaker 2>Like I've become a really good teacher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read more,</v>

1969
01:23:43.241 --> 01:23:45.880
<v Speaker 2>I fucking meditate more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like an awesome boyfriend.</v>

1970
01:23:45.880 --> 01:23:50.880
<v Speaker 2>Like I have such a good healthy fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship and I don't think any of </v>

1971
01:23:52.301 --> 01:23:57.301
<v Speaker 2>that shit would have happened if I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>still in social media world if I still </v>

1972
01:23:57.301 --> 01:24:00.421
<v Speaker 2>just woke up every day and was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the Hashtag that I have to tweet </v>

1973
01:24:00.421 --> 01:24:01.240
<v Speaker 2>about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are we angry about today?</v>

1974
01:24:01.241 --> 01:24:04.140
<v Speaker 2>Because that's how everyday starts as </v>
<v Speaker 2>you check twitter and you all.</v>

1975
01:24:04.150 --> 01:24:09.150
<v Speaker 2>There's a popular Hashtag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to come up with a fucking joke </v>

1976
01:24:09.150 --> 01:24:11.551
<v Speaker 2>because trump did a thing and it drove </v>
<v Speaker 2>me crazy and there's part of me that I </v>

1977
01:24:12.940 --> 01:24:14.230
<v Speaker 2>am like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe I'm selfish,</v>

1978
01:24:14.231 --> 01:24:15.130
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1979
01:24:15.180 --> 01:24:20.180
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would rather be a better person now </v>

1980
01:24:20.180 --> 01:24:22.030
<v Speaker 2>and try to be a comic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also forgot to like comedy fans,</v>

1981
01:24:22.031 --> 01:24:24.460
<v Speaker 2>just love comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when people came up to me after the</v>

1982
01:24:24.461 --> 01:24:29.461
<v Speaker 2>Stan hope show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't political on this Dan hope </v>

1983
01:24:29.461 --> 01:24:29.461
<v Speaker 2>show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they were like,</v>

1984
01:24:29.461 --> 01:24:29.461
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was really funny.</v>

1985
01:24:29.461 --> 01:24:29.800
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1986
01:24:29.801 --> 01:24:34.801
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you don't have to be overtly </v>

1987
01:24:34.801 --> 01:24:35.620
<v Speaker 2>fucking preachy or political to like </v>
<v Speaker 2>make someone's Day.</v>

1988
01:24:35.680 --> 01:24:37.120
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it sounds so cheesy.</v>

1989
01:24:37.121 --> 01:24:42.121
<v Speaker 2>Currency that you were training in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just thought you were trading and </v>

1990
01:24:42.121 --> 01:24:42.121
<v Speaker 2>progressive currency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1991
01:24:42.121 --> 01:24:46.531
<v Speaker 2>And I thought dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best and if I ever did was a story </v>

1992
01:24:46.531 --> 01:24:49.531
<v Speaker 2>about my dad and I almost didn't tell it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was with Janine Garafalo who's </v>

1993
01:24:49.531 --> 01:24:50.980
<v Speaker 2>very political in New York and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>telling her the story that happened.</v>

1994
01:24:50.981 --> 01:24:53.500
<v Speaker 2>We were just walking on union square and</v>
<v Speaker 2>she goes,</v>

1995
01:24:53.501 --> 01:24:55.990
<v Speaker 2>you have to tell that onstage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I literally said to her,</v>

1996
01:24:55.991 --> 01:24:57.640
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not political.</v>

1997
01:24:58.070 --> 01:24:59.410
<v Speaker 2>And she was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1998
01:24:59.411 --> 01:25:01.060
<v Speaker 2>you have to tell them on such a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>

1999
01:25:01.061 --> 01:25:02.560
<v Speaker 2>It's about a relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about,</v>

2000
01:25:02.580 --> 01:25:03.700
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your flaw is about what?</v>

2001
01:25:03.701 --> 01:25:05.500
<v Speaker 2>It was totally about me being flawed and</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucked up.</v>

2002
01:25:06.070 --> 01:25:11.070
<v Speaker 2>And it was the most enjoyable time I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had on stage was talking about that </v>

2003
01:25:11.921 --> 01:25:16.921
<v Speaker 2>and that's what I want to talk about now</v>
<v Speaker 2>is just like all the depression and </v>

2004
01:25:16.921 --> 01:25:17.550
<v Speaker 2>flaws and fuck ups and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2005
01:25:17.570 --> 01:25:22.570
<v Speaker 2>don't be a human herself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't box yourself into some category.</v>

2006
01:25:22.841 --> 01:25:24.520
<v Speaker 2>And that was the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2007
01:25:24.730 --> 01:25:27.130
<v Speaker 2>but I felt like I could only talk about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that stuff.</v>

2008
01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:27.880
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be like,</v>

2009
01:25:27.881 --> 01:25:31.000
<v Speaker 2>if you could only talk about like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>UFC and he'll talk about other shit.</v>

2010
01:25:31.110 --> 01:25:36.110
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been very fortunate that I don't </v>

2011
01:25:36.110 --> 01:25:37.821
<v Speaker 4>have to just talk about that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think I've been very conscious </v>

2012
01:25:37.821 --> 01:25:39.660
<v Speaker 4>about avoiding weird boxes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

2013
01:25:39.661 --> 01:25:44.661
<v Speaker 4>I've been stuck in some in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think that you can navigate this </v>

2014
01:25:44.661 --> 01:25:49.251
<v Speaker 4>world of social media,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it takes diligence and I think that </v>

2015
01:25:49.680 --> 01:25:54.680
<v Speaker 4>we're the first generation of human </v>
<v Speaker 4>beings that have had to encounter this </v>

2016
01:25:54.680 --> 01:25:59.030
<v Speaker 4>weird environment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean this is not an environment that </v>

2017
01:25:59.030 --> 01:25:59.030
<v Speaker 4>our parents grew up in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh.</v>

2018
01:25:59.030 --> 01:26:02.730
<v Speaker 4>So it's only if there's like a body of </v>
<v Speaker 4>information that we can draw upon.</v>

2019
01:26:03.170 --> 01:26:04.040
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not like a</v>

2020
01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:08.090
<v Speaker 3>lot of people have sort of figured it </v>
<v Speaker 3>out over the last hundred years and this</v>

2021
01:26:08.091 --> 01:26:09.830
<v Speaker 3>is how you manage the winter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2022
01:26:09.831 --> 01:26:14.831
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Firewood and you got to do this and </v>

2023
01:26:14.831 --> 01:26:17.111
<v Speaker 3>you've got to make sure that you drink a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of water when you go into the </v>

2024
01:26:17.111 --> 01:26:17.111
<v Speaker 3>mountains fucking move to la.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

2025
01:26:17.111 --> 01:26:17.930
<v Speaker 3>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2026
01:26:17.931 --> 01:26:21.530
<v Speaker 3>there's no history so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you become a real make mistakes.</v>

2027
01:26:21.531 --> 01:26:23.450
<v Speaker 3>You become really dependent on it and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>takes discipline,</v>

2028
01:26:23.451 --> 01:26:24.320
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2029
01:26:24.321 --> 01:26:29.321
<v Speaker 3>I like logged onto my twitter the other </v>
<v Speaker 3>day for the first time to like follow </v>

2030
01:26:29.321 --> 01:26:29.670
<v Speaker 3>you guys and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

2031
01:26:29.780 --> 01:26:34.780
<v Speaker 3>am I going to tweet anything?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I didn't because I just saw those </v>

2032
01:26:34.780 --> 01:26:37.661
<v Speaker 3>notifications and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some dark shit behind those </v>

2033
01:26:37.661 --> 01:26:37.661
<v Speaker 3>notifications that like of like I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 3>clicking it,</v>

2034
01:26:37.661 --> 01:26:40.850
<v Speaker 3>just can't be reading it and definitely </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't argue with people online.</v>

2035
01:26:41.300 --> 01:26:42.570
<v Speaker 3>There's no benefit to that.</v>

2036
01:26:42.820 --> 01:26:44.960
<v Speaker 3>I've almost essentially totally stopped </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing that.</v>

2037
01:26:44.961 --> 01:26:47.720
<v Speaker 3>Occasionally I'll fuck with someone if I</v>
<v Speaker 3>just am in the mood for it,</v>

2038
01:26:47.721 --> 01:26:50.690
<v Speaker 3>but the vast majority of the time my </v>
<v Speaker 3>phone is like this.</v>

2039
01:26:50.730 --> 01:26:52.280
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Face down.</v>

2040
01:26:52.550 --> 01:26:57.550
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget if it was like a jock or Tim </v>

2041
01:26:57.550 --> 01:26:57.550
<v Speaker 3>Ferriss or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or one of those guys,</v>

2042
01:26:57.550 --> 01:26:58.580
<v Speaker 3>but talking about like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2043
01:26:58.610 --> 01:27:03.610
<v Speaker 3>put it on airplane mode like an hour or </v>
<v Speaker 3>two before you go to bed and then like </v>

2044
01:27:03.610 --> 01:27:07.090
<v Speaker 3>not turning that shit on until like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've started doing all that and I just </v>

2045
01:27:07.090 --> 01:27:10.811
<v Speaker 3>feel so much healthier and I'm telling </v>
<v Speaker 3>you that when I was attacking people on </v>

2046
01:27:11.001 --> 01:27:16.001
<v Speaker 3>twitter everyday I was depressed as fuck</v>
<v Speaker 3>and straight up suicidal and projecting </v>

2047
01:27:16.220 --> 01:27:21.220
<v Speaker 3>and she's miserable and that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a rush.</v>

2048
01:27:21.291 --> 01:27:23.210
<v Speaker 3>You have a community,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have people who go,</v>

2049

<v Speaker 3>that whole sympathy,</v>

2056
01:27:34.430 --> 01:27:37.100
<v Speaker 3>mining something that a lot of people do</v>
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

2057
01:27:37.160 --> 01:27:39.620
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>important issues also get pushed aside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like [inaudible].</v>

2076
01:28:18.580 --> 01:28:18.580
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

2077
01:28:18.580 --> 01:28:18.580
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess if I'm going on Joe's,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2079
01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:21.200
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the fuck is going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw Kevin Spacey,</v>

01:28:21.201 --> 01:28:22.640
<v Speaker 3>I saw like people getting arrested and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that Mueller goes not playing </v>

2083
01:28:27.670 --> 01:28:27.670
<v Speaker 3>he's not fucking around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's,</v>

2084
01:28:27.670 --> 01:28:32.260
<v Speaker 3>it mean that guy was the longest running</v>
<v Speaker 3>head of the FBI since j Edgar Hoover.</v>

2085
01:28:33.050 --> 01:28:34.040
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2086
01:28:34.250 --> 01:28:39.250
<v Speaker 3>and he is like painstakingly broke down </v>
<v Speaker 3>this collusion with the Russians </v>

2087
01:28:41.390 --> 01:28:46.390
<v Speaker 3>situation and what it seems to me as an </v>
<v Speaker 3>outside person who doesn't really pay </v>

2088
01:28:46.911 --> 01:28:49.430
<v Speaker 3>too much attention to politics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I was going,</v>

2089
01:28:49.580 --> 01:28:53.240
<v Speaker 3>I would look at it like the mob,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I was going to attack the mob,</v>

2090
01:28:53.241 --> 01:28:56.100
<v Speaker 3>I would go after some low level people </v>
<v Speaker 3>first under at.</v>

2091
01:28:56.240 --> 01:28:58.340
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what he's doing.</v>

2092
01:28:58.700 --> 01:29:00.780
<v Speaker 3>He's bringing in these dudes that were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2093
01:29:00.810 --> 01:29:02.030
<v Speaker 3>manafort and he's bringing</v>

2094
01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:07.080
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these dudes that were running the </v>

2095
01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:07.080
<v Speaker 4>campaign and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

2096
01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:08.670
<v Speaker 4>and trump is unhinged today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Trump is making a bunch of,</v>

2097
01:29:08.671 --> 01:29:09.450
<v Speaker 4>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2098
01:29:09.451 --> 01:29:12.480
<v Speaker 4>it's great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know what's interesting too.</v>

2099
01:29:12.510 --> 01:29:17.510
<v Speaker 4>Then it just came out that Hillary and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the DNC funded the dossier on trump and </v>

2100
01:29:17.850 --> 01:29:20.340
<v Speaker 4>they spent millions to enlight about it </v>
<v Speaker 4>for the past year,</v>

2101
01:29:20.880 --> 01:29:25.880
<v Speaker 4>which is by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's you're trying to influence the </v>

2102
01:29:25.880 --> 01:29:29.151
<v Speaker 4>political process as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you're doing it by what you know is </v>

2103
01:29:29.151 --> 01:29:30.480
<v Speaker 4>fiction,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fictional story on trump with hookers,</v>

2104
01:29:30.481 --> 01:29:34.260
<v Speaker 4>pen on people and Shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's everyone's dirty and this is,</v>

2105
01:29:34.261 --> 01:29:39.261
<v Speaker 4>I think really important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the right has to recognize that </v>

2106
01:29:39.331 --> 01:29:44.331
<v Speaker 4>you're in a situation where you </v>
<v Speaker 4>absolutely have people that have </v>

2107
01:29:44.331 --> 01:29:48.951
<v Speaker 4>colluded with Russia the left half to </v>
<v Speaker 4>recognize you were in a situation where </v>

2108
01:29:48.951 --> 01:29:53.481
<v Speaker 4>you had a really corrupt career </v>
<v Speaker 4>politician who almost got in and don't </v>

2109
01:29:53.550 --> 01:29:58.550
<v Speaker 4>hold her up as some sort of high </v>
<v Speaker 4>standard for womanhood and progressive </v>

2110
01:29:58.550 --> 01:30:00.570
<v Speaker 4>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a woman that didn't even believe</v>

2111
01:30:00.571 --> 01:30:03.360
<v Speaker 4>in gay marriage until $2,013.</v>

2112
01:30:03.410 --> 01:30:05.180
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said that on stage when I was like,</v>

2113
01:30:05.190 --> 01:30:10.190
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when if you criticize hillary or that </v>

2114
01:30:10.190 --> 01:30:10.430
<v Speaker 2>people would say you're not a feminist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was like first rule of feminism,</v>

2115
01:30:10.431 --> 01:30:13.100
<v Speaker 2>like don't kill a bunch of fucking women</v>
<v Speaker 2>overseas.</v>

2116
01:30:13.101 --> 01:30:15.020
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you can't.</v>

2117
01:30:15.170 --> 01:30:17.510
<v Speaker 2>That was another problem with like my </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole thing is we couldn't.</v>

2118
01:30:17.660 --> 01:30:20.900
<v Speaker 2>If you criticize a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be one thing if you said,</v>

2119
01:30:20.990 --> 01:30:22.970
<v Speaker 2>I disagree with Hillary Clinton's </v>
<v Speaker 2>foreign policy,</v>

2120
01:30:23.150 --> 01:30:24.800
<v Speaker 2>that's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That should not be called sexist.</v>

2121
01:30:24.801 --> 01:30:29.801
<v Speaker 2>If you were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I disagree with Hillary Clinton's </v>

2122
01:30:29.801 --> 01:30:29.801
<v Speaker 2>foreign policy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what a whore.</v>

2123
01:30:29.801 --> 01:30:29.801
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2124
01:30:29.801 --> 01:30:29.810
<v Speaker 2>well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's unnecessary.</v>

2125
01:30:30.110 --> 01:30:31.610
<v Speaker 2>But you couldn't.</v>

2126
01:30:33.620 --> 01:30:36.250
<v Speaker 4>You couldn't say she is a known lie </v>
<v Speaker 4>because they would say,</v>

2127
01:30:36.251 --> 01:30:37.040
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a dog whistle.</v>

2128
01:30:37.041 --> 01:30:38.390
<v Speaker 4>That's what you call crazy ladies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2129
01:30:38.391 --> 01:30:43.391
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's when you call a fucking </v>

2130
01:30:43.391 --> 01:30:43.391
<v Speaker 4>politician.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2131
01:30:43.391 --> 01:30:45.610
<v Speaker 4>when they're crazy ladies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you should call them crazy crazy lady </v>

2132
01:30:45.610 --> 01:30:46.550
<v Speaker 4>politics or just crazy person will not </v>
<v Speaker 4>be specific to.</v>

2133
01:30:46.950 --> 01:30:48.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's also like,</v>

2134
01:30:48.451 --> 01:30:53.451
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the whole Caitlyn Jenner thing </v>

2135
01:30:53.451 --> 01:30:56.151
<v Speaker 2>where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't hate her because she's </v>

2136
01:30:56.151 --> 01:30:57.441
<v Speaker 2>translator because he's kind of a cut,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like she's a little bit of a fucking </v>

2137
01:30:57.441 --> 01:30:57.441
<v Speaker 2>republic.</v>

2138
01:30:57.441 --> 01:31:01.060
<v Speaker 4>The thing about Caitlyn Jenner,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Caitlyn Jenner doesn't believe in gay </v>

2139
01:31:01.060 --> 01:31:02.790
<v Speaker 4>marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is fucking patently insane.</v>

2140
01:31:02.820 --> 01:31:04.910
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's what people need to know.</v>

2141
01:31:05.220 --> 01:31:06.660
<v Speaker 4>You're a bad person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ale,</v>

2142
01:31:06.661 --> 01:31:08.790
<v Speaker 4>Kardashians.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what it is.</v>

2143
01:31:08.850 --> 01:31:12.600
<v Speaker 4>Who became a female car dash in and got </v>
<v Speaker 4>what he wanted,</v>

2144
01:31:12.720 --> 01:31:17.720
<v Speaker 4>which is massive amounts of attention.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you go back and look at Bruce Jenner </v>

2145
01:31:17.720 --> 01:31:22.040
<v Speaker 4>when he was Bruce Jenner and then look </v>
<v Speaker 4>at Caitlyn Jenner goal achieved </v>

2146
01:31:22.040 --> 01:31:23.910
<v Speaker 4>Katelyn's going at massive amounts of </v>
<v Speaker 4>attention.</v>

2147
01:31:24.030 --> 01:31:26.880
<v Speaker 4>People celebrating you're a hero.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're amazing.</v>

2148
01:31:26.970 --> 01:31:29.340
<v Speaker 4>Same dumb person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The</v>

2149
01:31:29.340 --> 01:31:34.200
<v Speaker 2>thing is I feel like you should this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It sounds like such a.</v>

2150
01:31:35.250 --> 01:31:40.250
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's easy for me to say it because I'm </v>

2151
01:31:40.250 --> 01:31:42.620
<v Speaker 2>like a white dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like I wish you could just </v>

2152
01:31:42.620 --> 01:31:46.131
<v Speaker 2>judge people as being people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we have systematic oppression of </v>

2153
01:31:46.131 --> 01:31:47.520
<v Speaker 2>certain groups of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2154
01:31:47.580 --> 01:31:51.600
<v Speaker 2>And I think a lot of people who say a </v>
<v Speaker 2>just judge people as people,</v>

2155
01:31:51.601 --> 01:31:55.170
<v Speaker 2>they're saying that while there's like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>black lives matter rally and it's like,</v>

2156
01:31:55.250 --> 01:31:57.420
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not the best time to like say it.</v>

2157
01:31:57.460 --> 01:31:58.660
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2158
01:31:59.020 --> 01:32:00.010
<v Speaker 2>but well,</v>

2159
01:32:00.010 --> 01:32:04.510
<v Speaker 3>the only reason why black lives matter </v>
<v Speaker 3>works at all is because it's an issue.</v>

2160
01:32:04.780 --> 01:32:07.550
<v Speaker 3>It's a matter doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2161
01:32:09.040 --> 01:32:10.210
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a real simple.</v>

2162
01:32:10.660 --> 01:32:12.190
<v Speaker 3>Like the only reason why people go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2163
01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:14.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll all lives matter.</v>

2164
01:32:14.290 --> 01:32:15.280
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But no one.</v>

2165
01:32:15.310 --> 01:32:18.730
<v Speaker 3>See there's a reason why no one's saying</v>
<v Speaker 3>white lives matter.</v>

2166
01:32:18.731 --> 01:32:23.731
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because the white people aren't being </v>

2167
01:32:23.731 --> 01:32:23.731
<v Speaker 3>oppressed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And people were like,</v>

2168
01:32:23.731 --> 01:32:24.670
<v Speaker 3>if you disagree with black lives matter </v>
<v Speaker 3>as an organization.</v>

2169
01:32:24.690 --> 01:32:26.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it was kind of run by.</v>

2170
01:32:26.441 --> 01:32:29.050
<v Speaker 3>One of them was really not really a </v>
<v Speaker 3>black guy.</v>

2171
01:32:29.051 --> 01:32:30.400
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole Shaun king thing.</v>

2172
01:32:30.820 --> 01:32:32.650
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he followed me on twitter.</v>

2173
01:32:33.640 --> 01:32:35.860
<v Speaker 3>Shut up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's kind of a fake black guy,</v>

2174
01:32:36.640 --> 01:32:41.640
<v Speaker 3>but there's a lot of issues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of issues for sure with </v>

2175
01:32:41.640 --> 01:32:45.541
<v Speaker 3>racism in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have a group that addresses those </v>

2176
01:32:45.541 --> 01:32:46.990
<v Speaker 3>issues and the group gets attacked by </v>
<v Speaker 3>people you gotta wonder like,</v>

2177
01:32:46.991 --> 01:32:48.330
<v Speaker 3>why is that group getting attacked?</v>

2178
01:32:48.370 --> 01:32:53.370
<v Speaker 3>And I'll even bring this back to like </v>
<v Speaker 3>even with the rape culture stuff,</v>

2179
01:32:53.680 --> 01:32:56.080
<v Speaker 3>which I did not think I would be saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the show again,</v>

2180
01:32:56.170 --> 01:33:01.170
<v Speaker 3>which is that they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd have guys online who every time a </v>

2181
01:33:02.261 --> 01:33:04.060
<v Speaker 3>woman got raped there'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2182
01:33:04.061 --> 01:33:06.220
<v Speaker 3>what about men who get raped?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you go,</v>

2183
01:33:06.221 --> 01:33:09.760
<v Speaker 3>well that's awful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but why do you say it when we're talking</v>

2184
01:33:09.761 --> 01:33:14.761
<v Speaker 3>about a woman being raped or why do you </v>
<v Speaker 3>only say all lives matter after like a </v>

2185
01:33:14.761 --> 01:33:16.600
<v Speaker 3>black kid was shot all the yeah buts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

2186
01:33:17.350 --> 01:33:18.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2187
01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:19.570
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

2188
01:33:19.571 --> 01:33:20.650
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what about us?</v>

2189
01:33:20.651 --> 01:33:22.450
<v Speaker 3>It's like it can not be about you for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>second.</v>

2190
01:33:22.451 --> 01:33:25.720
<v Speaker 3>And I was just as guilty of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like black lives matter when they go,</v>

2191
01:33:25.721 --> 01:33:27.160
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're racist against white people.</v>

2192
01:33:27.161 --> 01:33:29.710
<v Speaker 3>It's like the title itself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>black lives matter.</v>

2193
01:33:29.740 --> 01:33:32.500
<v Speaker 3>That's a low bar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just saying we exist,</v>

2194
01:33:32.501 --> 01:33:32.770
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2195
01:33:32.770 --> 01:33:36.100
<v Speaker 3>Like look at us like look at as being </v>
<v Speaker 3>gunned down in the St Louis being killed</v>

2196
01:33:36.101 --> 01:33:37.000
<v Speaker 3>by cops.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2197
01:33:37.001 --> 01:33:42.001
<v Speaker 3>It's not saying the black lives matter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>therefore like white people should be </v>

2198
01:33:42.001 --> 01:33:43.660
<v Speaker 3>killed by cops.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's nothing like that pool gets</v>

2199
01:33:43.680 --> 01:33:48.680
<v Speaker 3>so mad when it's not their group and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they always want to concentrate on </v>

2200
01:33:49.151 --> 01:33:52.150
<v Speaker 3>people that are black that make </v>
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous claims.</v>

2201
01:33:52.270 --> 01:33:57.270
<v Speaker 3>Like instead of just looking at the idea</v>
<v Speaker 3>behind why was black lives matter </v>

2202
01:33:57.270 --> 01:34:00.740
<v Speaker 3>formed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then they start looking at black people </v>

2203
01:34:00.740 --> 01:34:01.930
<v Speaker 3>to make ridiculous claims like black </v>
<v Speaker 3>people can't be racist because racism is</v>

2204
01:34:01.980 --> 01:34:04.960
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Our plus influence and prejudice,</v>

2205
01:34:04.990 --> 01:34:09.990
<v Speaker 3>which is just not read and that's the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same shit that people on the left would </v>

2206
01:34:09.990 --> 01:34:12.751
<v Speaker 3>do where they were just sort of like </v>
<v Speaker 3>nitpick at these very specific little </v>

2207
01:34:12.751 --> 01:34:15.010
<v Speaker 3>arguments and it's like there are bigger</v>
<v Speaker 3>things to fucking worry about.</v>

2208
01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:15.820
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2209
01:34:15.820 --> 01:34:19.600
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's why an organization </v>
<v Speaker 3>like black lives matter kits any heat at</v>

2210
01:34:19.601 --> 01:34:20.470
<v Speaker 3>all because right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>

2211
01:34:20.500 --> 01:34:21.640
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if people just said,</v>

2212
01:34:21.641 --> 01:34:25.090
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well course cops are absolutely shooting</v>

2213
01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:28.420
<v Speaker 3>black people at a disproportionate rate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2214
01:34:28.421 --> 01:34:33.421
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you just look at these incidences </v>

2215
01:34:33.421 --> 01:34:33.421
<v Speaker 3>that we've been forced to see in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>news,</v>

2216
01:34:33.421 --> 01:34:37.560
<v Speaker 3>there's been so many of them and these </v>
<v Speaker 3>people march and like what would that </v>

2217
01:34:37.560 --> 01:34:41.161
<v Speaker 3>one black woman who got pulled over and </v>
<v Speaker 3>refuse to put out a cigarette and the </v>

2218
01:34:41.161 --> 01:34:43.300
<v Speaker 3>cop was telling her to put out a </v>
<v Speaker 3>cigarette and she wants to be in dead in</v>

2219
01:34:43.301 --> 01:34:44.710
<v Speaker 3>her cell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a adult.</v>

2220
01:34:45.160 --> 01:34:46.500
<v Speaker 3>I think it was Sandra Bland.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2221
01:34:46.550 --> 01:34:48.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was just like hung herself.</v>

2222
01:34:48.001 --> 01:34:52.990
<v Speaker 3>That is a fucking insane story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That woman,</v>

2223
01:34:53.140 --> 01:34:54.640
<v Speaker 3>that cop was a piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2224
01:34:54.641 --> 01:34:57.650
<v Speaker 3>the way he was communicating with her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was not communicating with her.</v>

2225
01:34:57.651 --> 01:34:58.010
<v Speaker 3>Like she</v>

2226
01:34:58.010 --> 01:34:59.840
<v Speaker 1>was a woman that just got pulled over </v>
<v Speaker 1>for speeding.</v>

2227
01:35:00.140 --> 01:35:02.330
<v Speaker 1>He was communicating with her like she </v>
<v Speaker 1>was under him.</v>

2228
01:35:02.360 --> 01:35:05.900
<v Speaker 1>Like it was like he had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had to force his power on her.</v>

2229
01:35:06.350 --> 01:35:09.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean we've seen that kind of shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>before and if that's not racism,</v>

2230
01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:12.380
<v Speaker 1>it's absolutely shitty policing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the thing.</v>

2231
01:35:12.410 --> 01:35:17.410
<v Speaker 1>That's what we should talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's like what we were talking </v>

2232
01:35:17.410 --> 01:35:19.841
<v Speaker 1>about with the Islamophobia where it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're also being </v>

2233
01:35:19.841 --> 01:35:19.841
<v Speaker 1>counterproductive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2234
01:35:19.850 --> 01:35:24.350
<v Speaker 1>Like you want to say that the cops want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to go with like blue lives matter too.</v>

2235
01:35:24.351 --> 01:35:25.760
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cool,</v>

2236
01:35:26.150 --> 01:35:31.150
<v Speaker 1>why don't you guys should be the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>mad when there's Douche bags like that </v>

2237
01:35:31.150 --> 01:35:32.480
<v Speaker 1>who pulled over Sandra Bland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2238
01:35:32.540 --> 01:35:35.900
<v Speaker 1>You guys should be the most mad to clean</v>
<v Speaker 1>up your fucking organization to clean up</v>

2239
01:35:35.901 --> 01:35:38.610
<v Speaker 1>your shit and you should be on the front</v>
<v Speaker 1>lines.</v>

2240
01:35:39.040 --> 01:35:44.040
<v Speaker 1>How powerful would that be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like them on the front lines with black </v>

2241
01:35:44.040 --> 01:35:46.841
<v Speaker 1>lives matter being like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't want that shit in our </v>

2242
01:35:46.841 --> 01:35:46.841
<v Speaker 1>precincts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

2243
01:35:46.841 --> 01:35:48.230
<v Speaker 1>it's not even just about the way they </v>
<v Speaker 1>attack black people.</v>

2244
01:35:48.440 --> 01:35:53.440
<v Speaker 1>You saw that woman in Utah that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>arrested because she refused to draw </v>

2245
01:35:53.440 --> 01:35:54.040
<v Speaker 1>blood on someone who was in a coma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2246
01:35:54.080 --> 01:35:55.650
<v Speaker 1>I didn't say you didn't see that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2247
01:35:57.890 --> 01:36:02.890
<v Speaker 1>Someone got taken into custody or </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone got to take to the hospital </v>

2248
01:36:02.890 --> 01:36:02.890
<v Speaker 1>rather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2249
01:36:02.890 --> 01:36:06.380
<v Speaker 1>the cops showed up and demanded blood be</v>
<v Speaker 1>drawn without this person's consent,</v>

2250
01:36:06.381 --> 01:36:08.180
<v Speaker 1>which is against the law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>

2251
01:36:08.181 --> 01:36:10.220
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cop arrested the woman.</v>

2252
01:36:10.221 --> 01:36:15.221
<v Speaker 1>Now he's been fired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think most people are unqualified </v>

2253
01:36:15.381 --> 01:36:17.900
<v Speaker 1>to be police officers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a big job.</v>

2254
01:36:17.980 --> 01:36:22.980
<v Speaker 1>It's a big job and I think that there it</v>
<v Speaker 1>should be much more respected in which </v>

2255
01:36:24.590 --> 01:36:29.590
<v Speaker 1>it should be a much more difficult </v>
<v Speaker 1>position to attain and I think that this</v>

2256
01:36:29.790 --> 01:36:34.790
<v Speaker 1>here in lies the problem you're asking </v>
<v Speaker 1>regular people to deal with insane </v>

2257
01:36:34.790 --> 01:36:39.581
<v Speaker 1>amounts of power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Literally the ability to pull the </v>

2258
01:36:39.581 --> 01:36:41.780
<v Speaker 1>trigger on a person and their life and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we've seen time and time again,</v>

2259
01:36:41.930 --> 01:36:46.930
<v Speaker 1>people get away with ending lives in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>way in a matter that we the citizens </v>

2260
01:36:46.930 --> 01:36:47.580
<v Speaker 1>don't agree with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2261
01:36:47.590 --> 01:36:50.780
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bar is kind of crapped right?</v>

2262
01:36:50.810 --> 01:36:54.680
<v Speaker 1>Where now the things that you should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>using hand to hand combat for.</v>

2263
01:36:54.681 --> 01:36:57.290
<v Speaker 1>You're using tasers for the things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you should be tasting four,</v>

2264
01:36:57.291 --> 01:36:58.310
<v Speaker 1>you're shooting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2265
01:36:59.040 --> 01:36:59.900
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing,</v>

2266
01:36:59.901 --> 01:37:01.950
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't expect a,</v>

2267
01:37:01.990 --> 01:37:06.990
<v Speaker 1>the average police officer to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>use hand to hand combat on some person </v>

2268
01:37:06.990 --> 01:37:08.540
<v Speaker 1>when they have no idea what that </v>
<v Speaker 1>person's skill level.</v>

2269
01:37:09.280 --> 01:37:11.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless it's the cop is fucking steep.</v>

2270
01:37:11.501 --> 01:37:13.220
<v Speaker 1>Emile chick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the,</v>

2271
01:37:13.490 --> 01:37:15.110
<v Speaker 1>what are the odds?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to come out ahead.</v>

2272
01:37:15.460 --> 01:37:17.540
<v Speaker 1>You might get your fucking gun taken </v>
<v Speaker 1>away from you.</v>

2273
01:37:17.541 --> 01:37:18.560
<v Speaker 1>You might get shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2274
01:37:18.620 --> 01:37:20.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they should have to use </v>
<v Speaker 1>hand to hand combat.</v>

2275
01:37:20.751 --> 01:37:24.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's fucking insane position or </v>
<v Speaker 1>at least be trained better.</v>

2276
01:37:24.950 --> 01:37:26.630
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like people should not be dying.</v>

2277
01:37:26.930 --> 01:37:31.930
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't be tasting like mentally </v>
<v Speaker 1>ill people who are writing articles </v>

2278
01:37:31.930 --> 01:37:35.000
<v Speaker 1>also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of like really frail </v>

2279
01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:35.000
<v Speaker 1>people that are police officers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen them.</v>

2280
01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:35.000
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was some.</v>

2281
01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.550
<v Speaker 1>God that was the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were pulling this guy over and they</v>

2282
01:37:37.551 --> 01:37:39.950
<v Speaker 1>had this guy out on the curb and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>looked at this guy,</v>

2283
01:37:39.951 --> 01:37:42.560
<v Speaker 1>he had a little pot belly and these </v>
<v Speaker 1>little skinny arms.</v>

2284
01:37:42.561 --> 01:37:46.220
<v Speaker 1>That's adorable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not really look at it like I'm like this</v>

2285
01:37:46.221 --> 01:37:47.300
<v Speaker 1>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a victim.</v>

2286
01:37:47.510 --> 01:37:48.740
<v Speaker 1>Like if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone,</v>

2287
01:37:49.580 --> 01:37:52.790
<v Speaker 1>if someone just decided to turn on him </v>
<v Speaker 1>and punch him in the head,</v>

2288
01:37:52.791 --> 01:37:56.190
<v Speaker 1>he would be unconscious and he's a cop </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's like this frail</v>

2289
01:37:56.190 --> 01:38:01.190
<v Speaker 3>cop dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to have a friend who did </v>

2290
01:38:01.190 --> 01:38:02.160
<v Speaker 3>psychological profiles for people who </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to join the police academy.</v>

2291
01:38:02.370 --> 01:38:04.080
<v Speaker 3>And she told me some of the answers for </v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

2292
01:38:04.140 --> 01:38:06.450
<v Speaker 3>why these guys wanted to be cops.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like one guy,</v>

2293
01:38:06.451 --> 01:38:09.450
<v Speaker 3>she said literally wrote in his essay </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2294
01:38:09.570 --> 01:38:13.290
<v Speaker 3>I want to become a police officer so I </v>
<v Speaker 3>can finally get the respect I deserve.</v>

2295
01:38:13.830 --> 01:38:14.620
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2296
01:38:14.640 --> 01:38:16.010
<v Speaker 3>I mean they didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she didn't like,</v>

2297
01:38:16.050 --> 01:38:16.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he didn't go through,</v>

2298
01:38:16.951 --> 01:38:20.550
<v Speaker 3>but it's like there are those people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not all cops Hashtag.</v>

2299
01:38:20.700 --> 01:38:22.170
<v Speaker 3>There are those people who are just </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2300
01:38:22.171 --> 01:38:24.930
<v Speaker 3>there's one fucking power they want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They got fucking bullied.</v>

2301
01:38:24.931 --> 01:38:28.050
<v Speaker 3>They got for every good dumb enough to </v>
<v Speaker 3>say that on his application.</v>

2302
01:38:28.051 --> 01:38:30.060
<v Speaker 3>How many guys just internalized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I was saying.</v>

2303
01:38:30.120 --> 01:38:32.100
<v Speaker 3>All that guy that it was not fucking say</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2304
01:38:32.160 --> 01:38:37.160
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like that guy was so nuts enough </v>

2305
01:38:37.160 --> 01:38:37.160
<v Speaker 3>that he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

2306
01:38:37.160 --> 01:38:37.160
<v Speaker 3>They'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll understand.</v>

2307
01:38:37.160 --> 01:38:37.920
<v Speaker 3>They'll see where I'm coming from and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking wrote it.</v>

2308
01:38:37.921 --> 01:38:41.700
<v Speaker 3>There are so many fucking people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they need.</v>

2309
01:38:42.510 --> 01:38:44.700
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's a lot of people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't want to be police officers.</v>

2310
01:38:44.701 --> 01:38:49.701
<v Speaker 3>Like in La for awhile they hit these </v>
<v Speaker 3>giant billboards where they're </v>

2311
01:38:49.701 --> 01:38:50.190
<v Speaker 3>advertising how much you get to start.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2312
01:38:50.191 --> 01:38:52.800
<v Speaker 3>they're having trouble recruiting and </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit because nobody wants that job.</v>

2313
01:38:52.950 --> 01:38:55.290
<v Speaker 3>You're essentially the professional </v>
<v Speaker 3>enemy,</v>

2314
01:38:55.380 --> 01:38:56.970
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pulling people over.</v>

2315
01:38:56.971 --> 01:38:59.070
<v Speaker 3>Most of them have committed some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>a crime.</v>

2316
01:38:59.071 --> 01:39:01.350
<v Speaker 3>They're going to lie to you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they're dealing with liars all day.</v>

2317
01:39:02.340 --> 01:39:03.630
<v Speaker 3>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd ever thought about that,</v>

2318
01:39:03.631 --> 01:39:08.310
<v Speaker 3>but that's another thing where if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>also can't,</v>

2319
01:39:08.790 --> 01:39:13.790
<v Speaker 3>just like the cops should be trying </v>
<v Speaker 3>super hard to get rid of the bad ones.</v>

2320
01:39:15.270 --> 01:39:20.270
<v Speaker 3>If we demonize every cop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then those cops who have like a really </v>

2321
01:39:20.270 --> 01:39:22.890
<v Speaker 3>hard fucking job are going to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well fuck you guys.</v>

2322
01:39:22.980 --> 01:39:24.270
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>For sure.</v>

2323
01:39:24.390 --> 01:39:28.200
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's that it's that balance where and so</v>

2324
01:39:28.201 --> 01:39:32.340
<v Speaker 3>much of it comes down to just like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>economy and people's life sucking,</v>

2325
01:39:32.341 --> 01:39:33.630
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's really easy,</v>

2326
01:39:33.631 --> 01:39:38.070
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for people to shit on these like black,</v>

2327
01:39:38.071 --> 01:39:40.650
<v Speaker 3>like a inner city neighborhoods and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>

2328
01:39:40.850 --> 01:39:43.140
<v Speaker 3>why don't they call the cops?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is a neighborhood trash?</v>

2329
01:39:43.141 --> 01:39:43.530
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2330
01:39:43.531 --> 01:39:46.200
<v Speaker 3>because they called the cops and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>the dog gets shot or whatever.</v>

2331
01:39:46.220 --> 01:39:48.750
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it's like people just need.</v>

2332
01:39:48.810 --> 01:39:50.460
<v Speaker 3>I think that's why you sound like trump </v>
<v Speaker 3>and Bernie,</v>

2333
01:39:50.461 --> 01:39:52.380
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>People need fucking jobs.</v>

2334
01:39:52.440 --> 01:39:57.440
<v Speaker 3>They want to take care of their family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not reading twitter or the news </v>

2335
01:39:57.440 --> 01:40:01.491
<v Speaker 3>like I used to or that most of us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of us who live in this twitter </v>

2336
01:40:01.491 --> 01:40:04.911
<v Speaker 3>bubble,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these fucking so many of these </v>

2337
01:40:04.911 --> 01:40:05.370
<v Speaker 3>progressive journalists I hung out with </v>
<v Speaker 3>who were like 99 percent,</v>

2338
01:40:05.371 --> 01:40:10.371
<v Speaker 3>like so many of them were like fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>just spoiled rich kids who want it to </v>

2339
01:40:10.371 --> 01:40:10.371
<v Speaker 3>feel oppressed.</v>

2340
01:40:10.371 --> 01:40:10.830
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>

2341
01:40:10.950 --> 01:40:11.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2342
01:40:12.600 --> 01:40:17.600
<v Speaker 3>I hang out with all my white journalist </v>
<v Speaker 3>friends were like white kids.</v>

2343
01:40:18.180 --> 01:40:22.530
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see more diversity and fucking Jujitsu</v>

2344
01:40:22.770 --> 01:40:27.150
<v Speaker 3>than I ever did with the people who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>constantly talking about diversity.</v>

2345
01:40:27.151 --> 01:40:32.151
<v Speaker 3>It was a bunch of white kids trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>feel more progressive or more </v>

2346
01:40:32.151 --> 01:40:33.870
<v Speaker 3>intelligent and I'm very much including </v>
<v Speaker 3>myself.</v>

2347
01:40:34.290 --> 01:40:36.330
<v Speaker 3>And then I started going to Jujitsu and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2348
01:40:36.331 --> 01:40:38.490
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what a Mexican looks like.</v>

2349
01:40:38.491 --> 01:40:40.200
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2350
01:40:40.520 --> 01:40:42.240
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting back to what we're saying,</v>

2351
01:40:42.241 --> 01:40:47.241
<v Speaker 3>I think that one of the good things </v>
<v Speaker 3>about these groups like black lives </v>

2352
01:40:47.241 --> 01:40:49.140
<v Speaker 3>matter is regardless of whatever </v>
<v Speaker 3>controversy,</v>

2353
01:40:49.350 --> 01:40:51.540
<v Speaker 3>it's forcing the conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you have to have it?</v>

2354
01:40:51.570 --> 01:40:56.570
<v Speaker 3>You have to have that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just think they have to be careful </v>

2355
01:40:56.570 --> 01:40:56.570
<v Speaker 3>with</v>

2356
01:40:56.570 --> 01:40:58.980
<v Speaker 1>what they do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when kids get crazy and they want </v>

2357
01:40:58.980 --> 01:40:58.980
<v Speaker 1>to block off the highway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2358
01:40:58.980 --> 01:41:02.691
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't do that kind of shit because that </v>

2359
01:41:02.691 --> 01:41:04.651
<v Speaker 1>gives people a very bad impression of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what your organization stands for and </v>

2360
01:41:04.651 --> 01:41:08.580
<v Speaker 1>you're blocking off the highway and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>could stop people from saving your mom </v>

2361
01:41:08.580 --> 01:41:10.540
<v Speaker 1>who fell down and broke her head open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2362
01:41:10.541 --> 01:41:15.541
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna you're going to block off </v>

2363
01:41:15.541 --> 01:41:17.461
<v Speaker 1>the ambulance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to block off people that </v>

2364
01:41:17.461 --> 01:41:17.461
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that have to make a flight.</v>

2365
01:41:17.461 --> 01:41:17.830
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in and you're saying,</v>

2366
01:41:17.831 --> 01:41:18.310
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2367
01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:20.020
<v Speaker 1>that's how you make noise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2368
01:41:20.021 --> 01:41:21.580
<v Speaker 1>you cause people in convenience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2369
01:41:21.581 --> 01:41:26.581
<v Speaker 1>you disrupt the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the very systems that we need in order </v>

2370
01:41:26.581 --> 01:41:30.211
<v Speaker 1>to make civilization run correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you don't have to do that to get </v>

2371
01:41:30.211 --> 01:41:31.810
<v Speaker 1>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're saying you still okay now.</v>

2372
01:41:31.811 --> 01:41:32.380
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got It.</v>

2373
01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:37.560
<v Speaker 1>Because the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this you can blame on the media </v>

2374
01:41:37.560 --> 01:41:39.190
<v Speaker 1>where it's like those are the only </v>
<v Speaker 1>protest that get covered.</v>

2375
01:41:39.340 --> 01:41:42.610
<v Speaker 1>If you have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a peaceful protest with speakers,</v>

2376
01:41:42.730 --> 01:41:47.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>standing out for at a south side of </v>

2377
01:41:47.730 --> 01:41:49.441
<v Speaker 1>someone's like congressional office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's like that shit doesn't get </v>

2378
01:41:49.441 --> 01:41:49.441
<v Speaker 1>covered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember going to hold on a second.</v>

2379
01:41:49.441 --> 01:41:50.830
<v Speaker 1>You're right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the media,</v>

2380
01:41:50.890 --> 01:41:55.890
<v Speaker 1>but I think the media is slowly but </v>
<v Speaker 1>surely becoming irrelevant and the real </v>

2381
01:41:56.280 --> 01:41:59.990
<v Speaker 1>meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real media is what's left.</v>

2382
01:42:00.200 --> 01:42:05.200
<v Speaker 1>The only reason why the news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't even have to name an </v>

2383
01:42:05.200 --> 01:42:08.821
<v Speaker 1>organization in in quotes the news is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the news is because they have a long </v>

2384
01:42:08.921 --> 01:42:11.080
<v Speaker 1>history of disseminating information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2385
01:42:11.081 --> 01:42:13.810
<v Speaker 1>But people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>regular people are doing that now.</v>

2386
01:42:13.870 --> 01:42:18.870
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people are doing that now </v>
<v Speaker 1>through different websites and youtube </v>

2387
01:42:18.870 --> 01:42:21.160
<v Speaker 1>channels and I think that that's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>future and if we don't have to be,</v>

2388
01:42:21.460 --> 01:42:25.570
<v Speaker 1>as long as you're honest and you have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>real objective point of view,</v>

2389
01:42:25.720 --> 01:42:30.720
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to be sanctioned by some </v>
<v Speaker 1>gigantic corporation to get the fucking </v>

2390
01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:31.040
<v Speaker 1>truth now.</v>

2391
01:42:31.050 --> 01:42:31.870
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

2392
01:42:31.871 --> 01:42:36.871
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're less likely to get the truth out </v>

2393
01:42:36.871 --> 01:42:37.840
<v Speaker 1>because of your sponsors because of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean Msnbc is owned by Ge.</v>

2394
01:42:37.841 --> 01:42:42.841
<v Speaker 1>MSNBC is the quote unquote liberal </v>
<v Speaker 1>network and they're owned by like a </v>

2395
01:42:42.841 --> 01:42:43.930
<v Speaker 1>company that like fucking profit off a </v>
<v Speaker 1>war.</v>

2396
01:42:43.960 --> 01:42:48.960
<v Speaker 1>Dave Rubin had a post that he did today </v>
<v Speaker 1>to go to Dave Rubin's a twitter page </v>

2397
01:42:49.450 --> 01:42:54.450
<v Speaker 1>about why people distrust the media and </v>
<v Speaker 1>why the media is garbage today in their </v>

2398
01:42:54.450 --> 01:42:58.771
<v Speaker 1>coverage of this Kevin Spacey thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>because all of these different outlets </v>

2399
01:42:59.200 --> 01:43:02.440
<v Speaker 1>were saying that Kevin Spacey came out </v>
<v Speaker 1>as gay.</v>

2400
01:43:02.441 --> 01:43:03.970
<v Speaker 1>That was the name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the main headline,</v>

2401
01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:05.230
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't fuck a kiss.</v>

2402
01:43:05.380 --> 01:43:08.110
<v Speaker 1>Kevin Spacey came out as gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kevin Spacey came out as gay.</v>

2403
01:43:08.260 --> 01:43:09.390
<v Speaker 1>This was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2404
01:43:09.400 --> 01:43:10.870
<v Speaker 1>let's have a it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pull it up.</v>

2405
01:43:10.920 --> 01:43:12.460
<v Speaker 1>That sounds like we should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>applauding.</v>

2406
01:43:12.760 --> 01:43:13.750
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is.</v>

2407
01:43:14.650 --> 01:43:17.200
<v Speaker 1>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just shows you what it is like,</v>

2408
01:43:17.201 --> 01:43:20.640
<v Speaker 1>look at this media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why grow up?</v>

2409
01:43:20.650 --> 01:43:23.410
<v Speaker 1>Why doesn't the public trust us?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because this.</v>

2410
01:43:23.730 --> 01:43:28.090
<v Speaker 1>Look at this actor Kevin Spacey Decides,</v>
<v Speaker 1>declares he lives as a gay man.</v>

2411
01:43:28.330 --> 01:43:33.160
<v Speaker 1>Kevin Spacey announced Sunday night that</v>
<v Speaker 1>he will live as a gay man and we look at</v>

2412
01:43:33.161 --> 01:43:35.140
<v Speaker 1>all these different than New York Daily </v>
<v Speaker 1>News.</v>

2413
01:43:35.500 --> 01:43:37.420
<v Speaker 1>Reuters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the daily beast.</v>

2414
01:43:37.450 --> 01:43:42.450
<v Speaker 1>They're saying that he's gay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're saying he's gay because a </v>

2415
01:43:42.450 --> 01:43:46.540
<v Speaker 1>kid came out where a man now came out </v>
<v Speaker 1>and said Kevin tried to fuck him when he</v>

2416
01:43:46.541 --> 01:43:51.541
<v Speaker 1>was 14.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is like saying that he declares </v>

2417
01:43:51.541 --> 01:43:52.070
<v Speaker 1>he lives life</v>

2418
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:53.720
<v Speaker 3>as a gay man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God Damn it.</v>

2419
01:43:53.721 --> 01:43:56.060
<v Speaker 3>That's not the store know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That sounds like a festive thing.</v>

2420
01:43:56.061 --> 01:43:58.460
<v Speaker 3>We should all be like congratulations to</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kevin Spacey.</v>

2421
01:43:58.490 --> 01:44:03.490
<v Speaker 3>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said this in this statement where he </v>

2422
01:44:03.490 --> 01:44:05.330
<v Speaker 3>was apologizing for this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so like this.</v>

2423
01:44:05.870 --> 01:44:09.200
<v Speaker 3>This is so crazy one also.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how they choose,</v>

2424
01:44:09.410 --> 01:44:13.820
<v Speaker 3>but choose to frame it that way because </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone coming out is going to get a lot</v>

2425
01:44:13.821 --> 01:44:15.680
<v Speaker 3>of people paying attention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2426
01:44:16.100 --> 01:44:21.100
<v Speaker 3>Well and also I don't have the link to </v>
<v Speaker 3>link pedophilia always to.</v>

2427
01:44:21.140 --> 01:44:26.140
<v Speaker 3>Homosexuality isn't true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there are a lot of of people who </v>

2428
01:44:26.140 --> 01:44:27.770
<v Speaker 3>would consider themselves heterosexual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it was in the church or whatever</v>

2429
01:44:27.800 --> 01:44:32.800
<v Speaker 3>who are raping kids because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a power thing and they're sick or </v>

2430
01:44:32.800 --> 01:44:36.671
<v Speaker 3>pedophilia is just different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Being attracted to kids is different </v>

2431
01:44:36.671 --> 01:44:39.671
<v Speaker 3>than being attracted to like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like men and this is like also really </v>

2432
01:44:39.671 --> 01:44:42.560
<v Speaker 3>dangerous for to equate like uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to fuck a 14 year old,</v>

2433
01:44:42.650 --> 01:44:46.310
<v Speaker 3>which just like going down to west </v>
<v Speaker 3>Hollywood to like do some gay shit,</v>

2434
01:44:46.370 --> 01:44:51.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he has admitted that he did and </v>

2435
01:44:51.370 --> 01:44:51.750
<v Speaker 3>he said he doesn't recall it at all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he did say that</v>

2436
01:44:51.850 --> 01:44:53.900
<v Speaker 1>he had a problem with drinking and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

2437
01:44:54.010 --> 01:44:56.680
<v Speaker 1>if he did do anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was very sorry.</v>

2438
01:44:57.760 --> 01:45:00.640
<v Speaker 1>And we're talking about something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened at least 30 years ago.</v>

2439
01:45:00.710 --> 01:45:03.810
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's also a problem and this is,</v>

2440
01:45:03.850 --> 01:45:08.850
<v Speaker 1>this needs to be addressed because we </v>
<v Speaker 1>really don't know whether or not this </v>

2441
01:45:08.850 --> 01:45:10.810
<v Speaker 1>guy's memory is accurate because </v>
<v Speaker 1>something 30 years ago,</v>

2442
01:45:10.990 --> 01:45:13.780
<v Speaker 1>the problem with being 14 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his first of all,</v>

2443
01:45:13.781 --> 01:45:17.020
<v Speaker 1>14 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're so God damn confused.</v>

2444
01:45:17.021 --> 01:45:19.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He don't remember shit.</v>

2445
01:45:19.061 --> 01:45:23.620
<v Speaker 1>You are a wash in hormones and confusion</v>
<v Speaker 1>and insecurity.</v>

2446
01:45:23.680 --> 01:45:24.100
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

2447
01:45:25.070 --> 01:45:27.790
<v Speaker 3>he might've had something the last five </v>
<v Speaker 3>years of my life too.</v>

2448
01:45:28.030 --> 01:45:28.630
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2449
01:45:28.910 --> 01:45:33.910
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he might've had some weird run in with </v>

2450
01:45:33.910 --> 01:45:34.570
<v Speaker 1>Kevin Spacey that may or may not have </v>
<v Speaker 1>been sexually predatory.</v>

2451
01:45:34.660 --> 01:45:36.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what happened,</v>

2452
01:45:36.760 --> 01:45:41.760
<v Speaker 1>but to to decide that he's absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 1>telling the truth and Kevin Spacey's </v>

2453
01:45:41.760 --> 01:45:45.960
<v Speaker 1>absolutely covering this up by coming </v>
<v Speaker 1>out as gay to using that sort of </v>

2454
01:45:46.241 --> 01:45:47.990
<v Speaker 1>diffused the situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this sort of</v>

2455
01:45:48.650 --> 01:45:53.650
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is almost the opposite of when </v>

2456
01:45:53.650 --> 01:45:57.500
<v Speaker 3>twitter declares you guilty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is like the news declaring you </v>

2457
01:45:57.500 --> 01:45:57.500
<v Speaker 3>almost like innocent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2458
01:45:57.500 --> 01:46:02.120
<v Speaker 3>Where I don't know what happened to </v>
<v Speaker 3>letting a courts decide and talk about </v>

2459
01:46:03.451 --> 01:46:08.451
<v Speaker 3>people being accused and whatnot where </v>
<v Speaker 3>twitter can just like be like if they </v>

2460
01:46:08.451 --> 01:46:11.370
<v Speaker 3>say you're done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you had a John Ronson on.</v>

2461
01:46:11.371 --> 01:46:12.480
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did he talk?</v>

2462
01:46:12.481 --> 01:46:15.510
<v Speaker 3>Did he read that publicly?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shamed looks good and it's just like,</v>

2463
01:46:15.511 --> 01:46:17.010
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these people's lives are done.</v>

2464
01:46:17.011 --> 01:46:18.520
<v Speaker 3>And I was part of all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2465
01:46:18.600 --> 01:46:20.180
<v Speaker 3>I tweeted about fucking justine sacco.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

2466
01:46:20.340 --> 01:46:21.330
<v Speaker 3>Straight up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did.</v>

2467
01:46:21.630 --> 01:46:23.430
<v Speaker 3>And I read that book and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2468
01:46:23.431 --> 01:46:26.280
<v Speaker 3>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't think of that.</v>

2469
01:46:26.370 --> 01:46:27.240
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

2470
01:46:28.340 --> 01:46:29.180
<v Speaker 1>Shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2471
01:46:29.181 --> 01:46:32.540
<v Speaker 1>that's the worst example of that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are completely anonymous,</v>

2472
01:46:32.541 --> 01:46:34.070
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You weren't completely anonymous,</v>

2473
01:46:34.071 --> 01:46:39.071
<v Speaker 1>which is why you face the blowback where</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people that are just </v>

2474
01:46:39.071 --> 01:46:41.360
<v Speaker 1>have a twitter egg and they mean they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely anonymous.</v>

2475
01:46:41.361 --> 01:46:46.361
<v Speaker 1>They have a bunch of random letters and </v>
<v Speaker 1>numbers is their name and they fucking </v>

2476
01:46:46.361 --> 01:46:48.110
<v Speaker 1>attacked people left and right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a common thing on twitter.</v>

2477
01:46:48.770 --> 01:46:50.100
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're seeing</v>

2478
01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:55.160
<v Speaker 4>a new kind of interaction with human </v>
<v Speaker 4>beings and this interaction where </v>

2479
01:46:56.011 --> 01:47:01.011
<v Speaker 4>there's no social cues involved.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is virtually no repercussions for </v>

2480
01:47:01.011 --> 01:47:02.790
<v Speaker 4>saying the most evil,</v>
<v Speaker 4>vile shit.</v>

2481
01:47:03.060 --> 01:47:06.510
<v Speaker 4>And then people take it as a badge of </v>
<v Speaker 4>honor that they been blocked.</v>

2482
01:47:06.630 --> 01:47:07.490
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2483
01:47:07.950 --> 01:47:09.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And make it their twitter bio.</v>

2484
01:47:09.780 --> 01:47:10.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's,</v>

2485
01:47:11.040 --> 01:47:12.600
<v Speaker 2>it's weird times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2486
01:47:12.601 --> 01:47:13.680
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just wish,</v>

2487
01:47:14.250 --> 01:47:16.660
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being off twitter has I,</v>

2488
01:47:16.661 --> 01:47:19.110
<v Speaker 2>I wish it didn't happen in such a </v>
<v Speaker 2>horrific way,</v>

2489
01:47:19.230 --> 01:47:22.650
<v Speaker 2>but has definitely made me like I talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>to people more now.</v>

2490
01:47:22.680 --> 01:47:24.990
<v Speaker 2>I talked to people who disagree with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2491
01:47:25.110 --> 01:47:27.300
<v Speaker 2>I look people in the eyes more than I </v>
<v Speaker 2>used to.</v>

2492
01:47:27.301 --> 01:47:29.010
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not checking my phone.</v>

2493
01:47:29.890 --> 01:47:34.750
<v Speaker 4>Good thing to you all to ultimately to </v>
<v Speaker 4>because how else would you have escape?</v>

2494
01:47:34.751 --> 01:47:35.760
<v Speaker 4>I went live.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2495
01:47:35.770 --> 01:47:40.180
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's almost like you were in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>cult because I had a,</v>

2496
01:47:40.640 --> 01:47:45.640
<v Speaker 4>a Bret Weinstein's brother Eric on </v>
<v Speaker 4>recently and Eric was talking about the </v>

2497
01:47:45.880 --> 01:47:49.600
<v Speaker 4>cult of progressive ideology that it </v>
<v Speaker 4>literally is a cult.</v>

2498
01:47:49.900 --> 01:47:54.900
<v Speaker 4>Like the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the things that core things that </v>

2499
01:47:54.900 --> 01:47:56.620
<v Speaker 4>people keep saying is that biology and </v>
<v Speaker 4>gender are not related.</v>

2500
01:47:57.010 --> 01:48:02.010
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like there's some weird things that </v>

2501
01:48:02.010 --> 01:48:02.010
<v Speaker 4>people say in order to be supportive of </v>
<v Speaker 4>trans people.</v>

2502
01:48:02.010 --> 01:48:05.590
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of weird but these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these things that they're saying they're</v>

2503
01:48:05.591 --> 01:48:09.430
<v Speaker 4>not supported by science and they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>very culty and everyone repeats them and</v>

2504
01:48:09.431 --> 01:48:14.431
<v Speaker 4>they repeat them for the same reason why</v>
<v Speaker 4>people in certain religions repeat </v>

2505
01:48:14.801 --> 01:48:15.640
<v Speaker 4>religious phrases.</v>

2506
01:48:15.860 --> 01:48:20.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this goes back to that progressive </v>

2507
01:48:20.860 --> 01:48:20.860
<v Speaker 2>thing I was talking about where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2508
01:48:20.860 --> 01:48:24.760
<v Speaker 2>to me it was the reason that I wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>fully read a lot of those articles is </v>

2509
01:48:25.521 --> 01:48:28.250
<v Speaker 2>because I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I want to support those people.</v>

2510
01:48:28.251 --> 01:48:33.251
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And because I don't think trans people </v>

2511
01:48:33.251 --> 01:48:36.311
<v Speaker 2>should be discriminated against.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a shit where they want to </v>

2512
01:48:36.311 --> 01:48:36.560
<v Speaker 2>go to the bathroom unless it's like on </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody,</v>

2513
01:48:36.561 --> 01:48:37.790
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't care.</v>

2514
01:48:37.890 --> 01:48:39.600
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that everybody should,</v>

2515
01:48:39.680 --> 01:48:41.840
<v Speaker 2>should live and feel free as long as </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not being,</v>

2516
01:48:42.070 --> 01:48:43.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>predatory.</v>

2517
01:48:43.011 --> 01:48:45.030
<v Speaker 2>Or like when the Republicans were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2518
01:48:45.170 --> 01:48:47.420
<v Speaker 2>men are going to dress up as women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2519
01:48:47.421 --> 01:48:50.150
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's men like bosom buddies.</v>

2520
01:48:50.151 --> 01:48:55.151
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's like that was that like </v>

2521
01:48:55.151 --> 01:48:57.071
<v Speaker 2>trans people are different than men who </v>
<v Speaker 2>dress up as women and like sneaking the </v>

2522
01:48:57.071 --> 01:49:00.991
<v Speaker 2>fucking band,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be men who dress up like women </v>

2523
01:49:00.991 --> 01:49:01.640
<v Speaker 2>and seeking the bathrooms because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>can.</v>

2524
01:49:01.641 --> 01:49:06.641
<v Speaker 2>Because it's a loophole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they can just walk in the </v>

2525

01:49:06.641 --> 01:49:08.390
<v Speaker 4>there's going to be people that drive </v>
<v Speaker 4>into cards,</v>

2528
01:49:08.450 --> 01:49:10.050
<v Speaker 4>crowds of people with their car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2529
01:49:10.160 --> 01:49:12.480
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't mean that you shouldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 4>able to drive a car.</v>

2530
01:49:12.481 --> 01:49:13.180
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2531
01:49:13.460 --> 01:49:18.460
<v Speaker 4>you're going to have aberrations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not like there's a million </v>

2532
01:49:18.460 --> 01:49:20.630
<v Speaker 4>people right now sneaking into the </v>
<v Speaker 4>women's room to try to fuck kids.</v>

2533
01:49:21.550 --> 01:49:22.970
<v Speaker 4>I mean this is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is just,</v>

2534
01:49:22.971 --> 01:49:27.320
<v Speaker 4>you can't use those individual </v>
<v Speaker 4>incidences as aberrations.</v>

2535
01:49:28.050 --> 01:49:30.000
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so on awfulness.</v>

2536
01:49:30.001 --> 01:49:32.190
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so to go back to your cult thing,</v>

2537
01:49:32.300 --> 01:49:37.300
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do feel like you would have never </v>

<v Speaker 3>chats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We missed our opportunity radio lab and </v>

2576
01:51:11.851 --> 01:51:16.561
<v Speaker 3>voices and there I think there's an app </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were talking about and Sam Harris </v>

<v Speaker 3>Wayne articles.</v>

2579
01:51:21.020 --> 01:51:21.610
<v Speaker 3>Like it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

2580
01:51:21.611 --> 01:51:24.460
<v Speaker 3>we're steering a little too left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to balance this shit out.</v>

2581
01:51:24.461 --> 01:51:25.900
<v Speaker 3>And there's like an APP that can do </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

<v Speaker 3>now goes,</v>

<v Speaker 3>on your phone in general.</v>

2586

<v Speaker 3>and it's much better and,</v>

2587
01:51:38.710 --> 01:51:43.480

2591
01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:53.000
<v Speaker 3>other way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the reasons I didn't respond,</v>

2592
01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:56.880
<v Speaker 3>one of googling suicide and then I </v>
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't say this for my poor </v>

2593
01:51:56.880 --> 01:51:57.580
<v Speaker 3>girlfriend once she came back and like </v>
<v Speaker 3>had my back.</v>

2594
01:51:57.790 --> 01:52:01.270
<v Speaker 3>Like I said this on Doug actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>brought her up on stage for the podcast.</v>

2595
01:52:01.540 --> 01:52:02.490
<v Speaker 3>But she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2596
01:52:03.040 --> 01:52:04.900
<v Speaker 3>I thought she was going to break up with</v>
<v Speaker 3>me and she was like,</v>

2597
01:52:04.901 --> 01:52:07.390
<v Speaker 3>well I kind of wish you were more </v>
<v Speaker 3>predatory towards me.</v>

2598
01:52:07.391 --> 01:52:08.290
<v Speaker 3>And that's when I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna,</v>

2599
01:52:08.400 --> 01:52:09.970
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna marry you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're great.</v>

2600
01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:15.000
<v Speaker 3>You're a keeper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she totally had my back and creepy </v>

2601
01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:19.531
<v Speaker 3>thing to say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so many girls right now warming </v>

2602
01:52:19.531 --> 01:52:21.421
<v Speaker 3>up their fingers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting ready to attack a horrible </v>

2603
01:52:21.421 --> 01:52:21.470
<v Speaker 3>article was excited that his girlfriend </v>
<v Speaker 3>wants him to be friends.</v>

2604
01:52:22.060 --> 01:52:23.470
<v Speaker 3>She was kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's just funny.</v>

2605
01:52:23.471 --> 01:52:25.060
<v Speaker 3>She's a funny person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can be funny.</v>

2606
01:52:25.061 --> 01:52:28.580
<v Speaker 3>You can be funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can be funny and but fuck in.</v>

2607
01:52:29.020 --> 01:52:31.660
<v Speaker 3>When she had my back and like I kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>walked it back and was just like,</v>

2608
01:52:31.661 --> 01:52:34.420
<v Speaker 3>what am I going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was another part of me that didn't</v>

2609
01:52:34.421 --> 01:52:37.030
<v Speaker 3>want to write an article.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had people say to me,</v>

2610
01:52:37.480 --> 01:52:42.100
<v Speaker 3>I had one person who spoke at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>women's March who called me to be like,</v>

2611
01:52:42.101 --> 01:52:46.070
<v Speaker 3>this makes my job harder because when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you start to call</v>

2612
01:52:46.490 --> 01:52:50.260
<v Speaker 2>fighting with your girlfriend abuse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you start to call a a bad break up,</v>

2613
01:52:50.780 --> 01:52:55.780
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you start to call consensual </v>

2614
01:52:55.780 --> 01:52:58.990
<v Speaker 2>hookups on the road predatory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like this is what sexist point to </v>

2615
01:52:58.990 --> 01:53:03.550
<v Speaker 2>when they go the APP.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All these girls who talk about being </v>

2616
01:53:03.550 --> 01:53:03.550
<v Speaker 2>preyed on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's bullshit.</v>

2617
01:53:03.550 --> 01:53:07.420
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They point to like these in innocuous </v>

2618
01:53:07.420 --> 01:53:10.670
<v Speaker 2>normal situations and so that's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really scary.</v>

2619
01:53:10.671 --> 01:53:15.671
<v Speaker 2>But I also had people be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I defended myself and some people </v>

2620
01:53:15.671 --> 01:53:16.820
<v Speaker 2>told me this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I defended myself,</v>

2621
01:53:17.270 --> 01:53:22.270
<v Speaker 2>I would suddenly look like I'm saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't believe women or I'm saying that </v>

2622
01:53:22.820 --> 01:53:26.630
<v Speaker 2>because I'm defending just one person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>me and I'm like,</v>

2623
01:53:26.660 --> 01:53:28.340
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to be and I don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be.</v>

2624
01:53:28.341 --> 01:53:30.860
<v Speaker 2>I just want to be a fucking comic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be a voice for like,</v>

2625
01:53:30.861 --> 01:53:33.860
<v Speaker 2>bitches are crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I also don't want to be a voice for,</v>

2626
01:53:34.070 --> 01:53:36.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every guy is a fucking evil rapist,</v>

2627
01:53:36.291 --> 01:53:37.830
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want to tell jokes.</v>

2628
01:53:38.300 --> 01:53:42.620
<v Speaker 1>I move on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This experience in a lot of ways sort of</v>

2629
01:53:43.160 --> 01:53:48.160
<v Speaker 1>can guide you through it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what's been happening just in </v>

2630
01:53:48.160 --> 01:53:52.060
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Having this example of how it could all </v>

2631
01:53:52.060 --> 01:53:54.800
<v Speaker 1>go completely sideways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sideways and sideways,</v>

2632
01:53:55.180 --> 01:53:56.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>admittedly.</v>

2633
01:53:56.540 --> 01:53:59.510
<v Speaker 1>But even before it went bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was going sideways.</v>

2634
01:53:59.550 --> 01:54:04.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're attacking people without reading </v>

2635
01:54:04.550 --> 01:54:06.971
<v Speaker 1>the full story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I was depressed then and she </v>

2636
01:54:06.971 --> 01:54:07.220
<v Speaker 1>looking to get this sort of response by </v>
<v Speaker 1>attacking people,</v>

2637
01:54:07.240 --> 01:54:08.660
<v Speaker 1>gay people to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>

<v Speaker 1>James Positive total.</v>

2639
01:54:11.240 --> 01:54:13.430
<v Speaker 1>And then being addicted to this response</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

2640
01:54:13.431 --> 01:54:18.431
<v Speaker 1>And checking your phone all the time to </v>
<v Speaker 1>making sure you know the people on your </v>

2641
01:54:18.431 --> 01:54:19.610
<v Speaker 1>side where you're battling with someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>and calling them as sexist,</v>

2642
01:54:19.611 --> 01:54:22.210
<v Speaker 1>racist shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many followers this person has</v>

2644
01:54:25.830 --> 01:54:29.720

<v Speaker 2>and now just being able to like,</v>

2645
01:54:30.470 --> 01:54:33.450
<v Speaker 2>like wake up early,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take care of myself,</v>

2646
01:54:33.510 --> 01:54:35.460
<v Speaker 2>read books,</v>

<v Speaker 2>jokes and live your life as a human and </v>

2648
01:54:40.520 --> 01:54:43.740
<v Speaker 2>just be nice to people do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you I am nicer to people not</v>

2649
01:54:43.741 --> 01:54:46.500
<v Speaker 2>being this like fucking progress because</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just judging everybody.</v>

2650
01:54:46.530 --> 01:54:48.330
<v Speaker 2>How can you be nice to everyone?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can just like,</v>

2651
01:54:48.331 --> 01:54:49.830
<v Speaker 2>look at that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's fucking eating meat.</v>

2652
01:54:49.831 --> 01:54:50.880
<v Speaker 2>Look at that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

2653
01:54:51.120 --> 01:54:56.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got this fucking bumper sticker or </v>

2654
01:54:56.120 --> 01:54:58.011
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're just constantly looking to be </v>

2655
01:54:58.011 --> 01:54:58.011
<v Speaker 2>outraged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2656
01:54:58.011 --> 01:55:00.210
<v Speaker 1>The attack machine of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just the progressive ideology,</v>

2657
01:55:00.211 --> 01:55:02.880
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right wing ideology as well.</v>

2658
01:55:02.881 --> 01:55:05.700
<v Speaker 1>It's an attack machine and you can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>enjoy things like,</v>

2659
01:55:05.701 --> 01:55:06.930
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anytime you tweet,</v>

2660
01:55:06.931 --> 01:55:08.160
<v Speaker 1>like I went to this movie and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2661
01:55:08.161 --> 01:55:12.250
<v Speaker 1>well this actor is problematic or this </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie is fucking racist because of.</v>

2662
01:55:12.260 --> 01:55:13.500
<v Speaker 1>And it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know man,</v>

2663
01:55:13.501 --> 01:55:16.140
<v Speaker 1>I just had a good night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted to go see a fucking movie.</v>

2664
01:55:16.141 --> 01:55:19.590
<v Speaker 1>Like I think that people are getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>tired of it though,</v>

2665
01:55:19.680 --> 01:55:24.680
<v Speaker 1>and this is what I'm hoping if you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about this sort of balances out </v>

2666
01:55:24.680 --> 01:55:27.150
<v Speaker 1>and that this is a new form of </v>
<v Speaker 1>communication that we're engaging in and</v>

2667
01:55:27.151 --> 01:55:28.500
<v Speaker 1>people are doing it poorly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2668
01:55:28.501 --> 01:55:29.510
<v Speaker 1>and I'll say this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was</v>

2669
01:55:29.680 --> 01:55:32.170
<v Speaker 2>very surprised because I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was taught,</v>

2670
01:55:32.171 --> 01:55:37.171
<v Speaker 2>when I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I told some comic friends that I </v>

2671
01:55:37.171 --> 01:55:38.380
<v Speaker 2>wanted to go back to standup or Improv </v>
<v Speaker 2>you people and I was like,</v>

2672
01:55:39.250 --> 01:55:41.170
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one wants to hear about my shit.</v>

2673
01:55:41.180 --> 01:55:44.010
<v Speaker 2>No one wants to hear a rant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Being a moderate</v>

2674
01:55:44.010 --> 01:55:45.990
<v Speaker 3>and so many people like hush hush.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're like,</v>

2675
01:55:46.020 --> 01:55:51.020
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they do because they're sick of the </v>

2676
01:55:51.020 --> 01:55:51.020
<v Speaker 3>extremes on both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're sick of all this.</v>

2677
01:55:51.020 --> 01:55:54.981
<v Speaker 3>Like just everyone's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these trump jokes are just like so </v>

2678
01:55:54.981 --> 01:55:56.040
<v Speaker 3>fucking just it's white noise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>white noise.</v>

2679
01:55:56.041 --> 01:56:01.041
<v Speaker 3>So these progressive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're trying to out progressive each </v>

2680
01:56:01.041 --> 01:56:03.950
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So people that consider themselves </v>

2681
01:56:03.950 --> 01:56:04.110
<v Speaker 3>progressives are also getting attacked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the Bret Weinstein thing,</v>

2682
01:56:04.260 --> 01:56:05.940
<v Speaker 3>or do you mean he's getting called a </v>
<v Speaker 3>racist?</v>

2683
01:56:05.941 --> 01:56:10.941
<v Speaker 3>Like if you'd know him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like one of the most deeply </v>

2684
01:56:10.941 --> 01:56:13.491
<v Speaker 3>progressive guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like probably I've ever had a chance to </v>

2685
01:56:13.491 --> 01:56:13.491
<v Speaker 3>talk to why that was the rose McGowan </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

2686
01:56:13.491 --> 01:56:16.010
<v Speaker 3>That was the guy I heard on on Sam </v>
<v Speaker 3>Harris's where if,</v>

2687
01:56:16.120 --> 01:56:19.980
<v Speaker 3>if something happens to a white person </v>
<v Speaker 3>than someone will be like,</v>

2688
01:56:19.981 --> 01:56:21.150
<v Speaker 3>well what did that happen to a black </v>
<v Speaker 3>person?</v>

2689
01:56:21.151 --> 01:56:21.530
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

2690
01:56:21.540 --> 01:56:22.140
<v Speaker 3>that would be bad too.</v>

2691
01:56:22.140 --> 01:56:23.150
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well what if it happened to.</v>

2692
01:56:23.160 --> 01:56:28.160
<v Speaker 3>And then someone else would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what about a black trans person or </v>

2693
01:56:28.160 --> 01:56:30.660
<v Speaker 3>lensing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The silencing thing is so fucked up and </v>

2694
01:56:30.660 --> 01:56:31.560
<v Speaker 3>this is what people are trying to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to silence people.</v>

2695
01:56:31.680 --> 01:56:33.650
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to get people fired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the,</v>

2696
01:56:33.700 --> 01:56:37.980
<v Speaker 3>the answer to bad speech is not </v>
<v Speaker 3>silencing people.</v>

2697
01:56:38.010 --> 01:56:39.480
<v Speaker 3>It's better speech,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2698
01:56:39.520 --> 01:56:42.090
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that one of the things that nick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's his name?</v>

2699
01:56:42.300 --> 01:56:45.030
<v Speaker 3>What is his last name that was on Sam </v>
<v Speaker 3>Harris' podcast.</v>

2700
01:56:46.590 --> 01:56:47.580
<v Speaker 3>I'll pull it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2701
01:56:47.581 --> 01:56:50.190
<v Speaker 3>and I think that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was one of the really important things</v>

2702
01:56:50.191 --> 01:56:51.990
<v Speaker 3>that he said that I completely agree </v>
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>

2703
01:56:52.080 --> 01:56:57.080
<v Speaker 3>I will say that I do think both sides </v>
<v Speaker 3>say that like even when I was on not the</v>

2704
01:56:58.971 --> 01:57:01.430
<v Speaker 3>comedy side of the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of the thing,</v>

2705
01:57:01.460 --> 01:57:06.460
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like shouting down at the female </v>

2706
01:57:06.591 --> 01:57:08.600
<v Speaker 3>journalists are trying to get them </v>
<v Speaker 3>fired.</v>

2707
01:57:08.750 --> 01:57:13.010
<v Speaker 3>Is still just as bad as complaining </v>
<v Speaker 3>about tosses joke.</v>

2708
01:57:13.040 --> 01:57:14.750
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it is both sides.</v>

2709
01:57:14.751 --> 01:57:18.350
<v Speaker 3>Trying to shut the other person down </v>
<v Speaker 3>instead of like a dialogue.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 3>of my views on everything.</v>

2730
01:58:03.990 --> 01:58:04.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>So facing the crowd facing the crowd.</v>

2733
01:58:11.270 --> 01:58:16.270
<v Speaker 3>It was about women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This woman shouted him down and you </v>

2734
01:58:16.270 --> 01:58:16.490

<v Speaker 3>allowed to have like,</v>

2738
01:58:30.461 --> 01:58:31.490

01:58:45.280 --> 01:58:50.280
<v Speaker 5>which we last night to now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We've been arguing with people who are </v>

2744
01:58:50.280 --> 01:58:53.440
<v Speaker 5>not willing to be listened to for a long</v>
<v Speaker 5>time and all I see from you is arrogance</v>

2745
01:58:54.250 --> 01:58:58.090
<v Speaker 5>and ego.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I am sick looking at you.</v>

2746
01:58:58.150 --> 01:59:00.770
<v Speaker 5>I am disgusted watching.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Argue with you.</v>

2747
01:59:00.880 --> 01:59:03.190
<v Speaker 5>You are not listening.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You are disgusting.</v>

2748
01:59:08.820 --> 01:59:11.640
<v Speaker 5>I don't think you understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And before I wasn't I before,</v>

2749
01:59:11.641 --> 01:59:14.490
<v Speaker 5>I was not angry per say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was disappointed.</v>

2750
01:59:14.491 --> 01:59:17.490
<v Speaker 5>Maybe I thought maybe there was room for</v>
<v Speaker 5>before an apology.</v>

2751
01:59:17.491 --> 01:59:20.070
<v Speaker 5>You've clearly told us that children are</v>
<v Speaker 5>plant.</v>

2752
01:59:20.071 --> 01:59:25.071
<v Speaker 5>Offer an apology for your words.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You left the meeting last night to go </v>

2753
01:59:25.071 --> 01:59:26.880
<v Speaker 5>home and then tweaked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do not interrupt me.</v>

2754
01:59:27.060 --> 01:59:30.630
<v Speaker 5>Two tweets from your twitter and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>the filaments.</v>

2755
01:59:30.631 --> 01:59:32.280
<v Speaker 5>Twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you showed no remorse.</v>

2756
01:59:32.610 --> 01:59:35.730
<v Speaker 5>You tried to let your wife leave that </v>
<v Speaker 5>conversation without having answered for</v>

2757
01:59:35.731 --> 01:59:37.590
<v Speaker 5>herself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is disgusting.</v>

2758
01:59:37.650 --> 01:59:40.350
<v Speaker 5>That is sick and now I wasn't angry </v>
<v Speaker 5>before.</v>

2759
01:59:40.980 --> 01:59:43.620
<v Speaker 5>I was not angry before,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but now I'm actually angry.</v>

2760
01:59:43.621 --> 01:59:45.390
<v Speaker 5>Sir.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really do not interrupt me.</v>

2761
01:59:45.540 --> 01:59:49.530
<v Speaker 5>I was not angry and now I want your job </v>
<v Speaker 5>to be taken from me.</v>

2762
01:59:50.160 --> 01:59:55.160
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to have this job.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I am disgusted knowing that you worked </v>

2763
01:59:55.160 --> 01:59:55.980
<v Speaker 5>at Yale University where I will get my </v>
<v Speaker 5>degree.</v>

2764
01:59:56.400 --> 01:59:57.570
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I will look back and think.</v>

2765
01:59:57.571 --> 01:59:58.750
<v Speaker 5>I used to argue with you.</v>

2766
02:00:01.600 --> 02:00:03.710
<v Speaker 5>Don't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't do it.</v>

2767
02:00:04.020 --> 02:00:09.020
<v Speaker 5>To not do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is not the day you do not want to </v>

2768
02:00:09.020 --> 02:00:09.020
<v Speaker 5>play this game with or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't wanna.</v>

2769
02:00:09.020 --> 02:00:10.230
<v Speaker 5>Play this game with me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay?</v>

2770
02:00:10.231 --> 02:00:15.231
<v Speaker 5>I understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look at me in my face first of all and </v>

2771
02:00:15.231 --> 02:00:16.680
<v Speaker 5>understand that you are such a </v>
<v Speaker 5>disappointment to this university,</v>

2772
02:00:16.740 --> 02:00:18.480
<v Speaker 5>to your students,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to yourself,</v>

2773
02:00:18.550 --> 02:00:20.710
<v Speaker 5>to the things that you claim to agree </v>
<v Speaker 5>with you.</v>

2774
02:00:20.750 --> 02:00:24.420
<v Speaker 5>If you want free dialogue,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you want free speech.</v>

2775
02:00:24.510 --> 02:00:26.280
<v Speaker 5>This is how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Someone speaks,</v>

2776
02:00:26.370 --> 02:00:28.290
<v Speaker 5>you listen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're not cut them up.</v>

2777
02:00:28.380 --> 02:00:30.790
<v Speaker 5>You did not do these,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these condescending gesture.</v>

2778
02:00:30.810 --> 02:00:33.740
<v Speaker 5>You not smirk.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You look them in the face and you wait.</v>

2779
02:00:34.120 --> 02:00:35.940
<v Speaker 5>You wait,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your turn.</v>

2780
02:00:38.800 --> 02:00:43.670
<v Speaker 3>I think napping is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just so fucking characteristic.</v>

2781
02:00:43.700 --> 02:00:48.700
<v Speaker 3>The most upsetting part of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think what upset me the most is she </v>

2782
02:00:48.700 --> 02:00:50.520
<v Speaker 3>has my poetry cadence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like she was doing the same moves</v>

2783
02:00:50.521 --> 02:00:55.521
<v Speaker 3>and the same delivery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well she was just trying to be </v>

2784
02:00:55.521 --> 02:00:56.030
<v Speaker 3>intelligent and say something and shut </v>
<v Speaker 3>him up and sound sin.</v>

2785
02:00:56.031 --> 02:00:58.370
<v Speaker 3>But that's the most important thing is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that she didn't want a dialogue.</v>

2786
02:00:58.420 --> 02:00:59.720
<v Speaker 3>She wanted to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He also,</v>

2787
02:00:59.721 --> 02:01:02.480
<v Speaker 3>from what I remember on the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he didn't need to be out there.</v>

2788
02:01:02.510 --> 02:01:05.200
<v Speaker 3>He stayed up there for hours and talk to</v>
<v Speaker 3>those people are super reasonable.</v>

2789
02:01:05.240 --> 02:01:07.460
<v Speaker 3>So when she was saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're wasting my time or whatever.</v>

2790
02:01:07.461 --> 02:01:12.461
<v Speaker 3>Like he came out to try to Kinda like </v>
<v Speaker 3>have his wife's back and like calling </v>

2791
02:01:12.461 --> 02:01:14.810
<v Speaker 3>him like he came out to have a dial when</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hear them out.</v>

2792
02:01:14.811 --> 02:01:16.950
<v Speaker 3>But like he didn't fucking need to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

2793
02:01:17.160 --> 02:01:19.370
<v Speaker 3>What she was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to have your job.</v>

2794
02:01:19.371 --> 02:01:20.600
<v Speaker 3>This is where I'm going to get my </v>
<v Speaker 3>degree.</v>

2795
02:01:20.660 --> 02:01:22.210
<v Speaker 3>And guess what fucker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2796
02:01:22.230 --> 02:01:27.230
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as somebody who lost their job and as </v>

2797
02:01:27.831 --> 02:01:30.710
<v Speaker 3>someone who has gone after people on </v>
<v Speaker 3>twitter,</v>

2798
02:01:31.040 --> 02:01:36.040
<v Speaker 3>those people that we tried to get fired </v>
<v Speaker 3>or from a writing job or whatever,</v>

2799
02:01:38.780 --> 02:01:43.780
<v Speaker 3>you think about them the next day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the people who tried to get that </v>

2800
02:01:43.780 --> 02:01:46.070
<v Speaker 3>guy fired on twitter or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they don't think about him anymore.</v>

2801
02:01:46.190 --> 02:01:48.080
<v Speaker 3>If he got fired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are kids.</v>

2802
02:01:48.110 --> 02:01:50.570
<v Speaker 3>I mean you're looking at an 18 year old </v>
<v Speaker 3>or a 19 year old,</v>

2803
02:01:50.600 --> 02:01:54.470
<v Speaker 3>but the twitter and intoxicated </v>
<v Speaker 3>intoxicated by that moment as well,</v>

2804
02:01:54.471 --> 02:01:55.130
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2805
02:01:55.131 --> 02:01:57.440
<v Speaker 3>But the twitter mob behind them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a lot of me's,</v>

2806
02:01:57.590 --> 02:01:59.180
<v Speaker 3>a lot of adults too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2807
02:01:59.240 --> 02:02:01.520
<v Speaker 3>and like that dude got fired and his </v>
<v Speaker 3>wife got fired.</v>

2808
02:02:01.520 --> 02:02:03.200
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's,</v>

2809
02:02:03.440 --> 02:02:06.030
<v Speaker 3>that's like somebody's life who's done a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of really good progress.</v>

2810
02:02:06.031 --> 02:02:08.360
<v Speaker 3>They're saying even if he did fuck up </v>
<v Speaker 3>legitimately,</v>

2811
02:02:08.370 --> 02:02:13.370
<v Speaker 3>it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's also the consequence of </v>

2812
02:02:13.370 --> 02:02:13.580
<v Speaker 3>actually being able to be fired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a problem.</v>

2813
02:02:13.610 --> 02:02:16.640
<v Speaker 3>Like say if you were running a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Jamie Kilstein show,</v>

2814
02:02:16.641 --> 02:02:18.600
<v Speaker 3>you got your own podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone can't fire you,</v>

2815
02:02:18.800 --> 02:02:19.790
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

2816
02:02:19.850 --> 02:02:23.690
<v Speaker 3>that's really important to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 3>fully and completely express yourself.</v>

2817
02:02:23.720 --> 02:02:28.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you had done something </v>

2818
02:02:28.720 --> 02:02:30.761
<v Speaker 3>horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the marketplace of free ideas should </v>

2819
02:02:30.761 --> 02:02:31.730
<v Speaker 3>step in and say we're not going to watch</v>
<v Speaker 3>his show anymore when I got to listen to</v>

2820
02:02:31.731 --> 02:02:34.250
<v Speaker 3>him anymore and that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would be normal and real.</v>

2821
02:02:34.830 --> 02:02:38.510
<v Speaker 3>The problem with being a professor of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the university is twofold problem,</v>

2822
02:02:38.511 --> 02:02:43.511
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's tenure and tenure makes </v>

2823
02:02:43.511 --> 02:02:45.461
<v Speaker 3>professors arrogant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes professors realized that they </v>

2824
02:02:45.461 --> 02:02:46.940
<v Speaker 3>can't leave and then they suck at it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're terrible.</v>

2825
02:02:47.120 --> 02:02:48.410
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really common.</v>

2826
02:02:48.411 --> 02:02:53.411
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like winning the lottery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they become lazy and weak or they </v>

2827
02:02:53.411 --> 02:02:55.340
<v Speaker 3>become the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2828
02:02:55.450 --> 02:03:00.450
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ideal situation is they become </v>

2829
02:03:00.450 --> 02:03:00.450
<v Speaker 3>completely dedicated to being a </v>
<v Speaker 3>professor.</v>

2830
02:03:00.450 --> 02:03:02.480
<v Speaker 3>I don't have to worry anymore about </v>
<v Speaker 3>their job.</v>

2831
02:03:02.481 --> 02:03:06.020
<v Speaker 3>And so now they completely dedicate </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves to being an educator.</v>

2832
02:03:06.240 --> 02:03:11.240
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what we would hope that they </v>

2833
02:03:11.240 --> 02:03:11.240
<v Speaker 3>don't have to worry about being fired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2834
02:03:11.240 --> 02:03:13.610
<v Speaker 3>And I really hope that the people </v>
<v Speaker 3>listening to this,</v>

2835
02:03:13.740 --> 02:03:17.860
<v Speaker 3>because I wouldn't have listened to that</v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast if I brought up that podcast and</v>

2836
02:03:17.861 --> 02:03:20.270
<v Speaker 3>my old circle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would have gotten in trouble.</v>

2837
02:03:20.540 --> 02:03:25.540
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to listen to a lot of your </v>

2838
02:03:25.540 --> 02:03:27.371
<v Speaker 3>shows and I'm sure there are people who </v>
<v Speaker 3>completely disagree with me </v>

2839
02:03:27.371 --> 02:03:28.400
<v Speaker 3>ideologically who wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2840
02:03:28.460 --> 02:03:31.370
<v Speaker 3>read whatever that the interceptor </v>
<v Speaker 3>democracy now or,</v>

2841
02:03:31.371 --> 02:03:32.420
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or something on the other side.</v>

2842
02:03:32.780 --> 02:03:37.780
<v Speaker 3>And it's like my life has gotten so much</v>
<v Speaker 3>better and wider and vaster and I think </v>

2843
02:03:38.091 --> 02:03:40.280
<v Speaker 3>it's made me a more empathetic person </v>
<v Speaker 3>because again,</v>

2844
02:03:40.310 --> 02:03:45.310
<v Speaker 3>on the left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just assume you're empathetic </v>

2845
02:03:45.310 --> 02:03:45.310
<v Speaker 3>because you're on the left.</v>

2846
02:03:45.310 --> 02:03:48.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even though you're trying to get people </v>

2847
02:03:48.550 --> 02:03:50.081
<v Speaker 3>fired,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though you're going out for their </v>

2848
02:03:50.081 --> 02:03:50.081
<v Speaker 3>jobs and you're insulting them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

2849
02:03:50.081 --> 02:03:51.620
<v Speaker 3>you're labeling them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the,</v>

2850
02:03:51.640 --> 02:03:56.640
<v Speaker 3>the broadest strokes of racism and </v>
<v Speaker 3>sexism and know you're calling them </v>

2851
02:03:57.530 --> 02:04:02.530
<v Speaker 3>terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's the problem where it's like </v>

2852
02:04:02.530 --> 02:04:03.350
<v Speaker 3>framing and then that makes your larger </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideals,</v>

2853
02:04:03.530 --> 02:04:05.150
<v Speaker 3>which are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can be correct.</v>

2854
02:04:05.870 --> 02:04:07.600
<v Speaker 3>They don't matter as more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2855
02:04:07.670 --> 02:04:10.400
<v Speaker 3>because you're not acting like I came in</v>
<v Speaker 3>being.</v>

2856
02:04:10.401 --> 02:04:15.401
<v Speaker 3>And then it's also like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you actually even care about those </v>

2857
02:04:15.401 --> 02:04:15.401
<v Speaker 3>groups you're defending or do you just </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to be on sort of the right side and</v>

2858
02:04:15.401 --> 02:04:17.600
<v Speaker 3>get your bonus points?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is like,</v>

2859
02:04:17.690 --> 02:04:18.870
<v Speaker 3>that's a big part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2860
02:04:18.990 --> 02:04:21.410
<v Speaker 3>I would like to think I was both,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2861
02:04:21.411 --> 02:04:26.411
<v Speaker 3>like when they turned,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't suddenly just like fuck gay </v>

2862
02:04:26.411 --> 02:04:26.411
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

2863
02:04:26.411 --> 02:04:27.560
<v Speaker 3>But you did eat a steak right away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2864
02:04:27.980 --> 02:04:32.980
<v Speaker 3>But it was a heterosexual CIS cow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most cows are actually dumped the </v>

2865
02:04:34.570 --> 02:04:35.510
<v Speaker 3>Navajo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2866
02:04:35.511 --> 02:04:36.980
<v Speaker 3>that's what a steer is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>

2867
02:04:37.590 --> 02:04:38.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2868
02:04:38.190 --> 02:04:39.700
<v Speaker 4>they cut their balls off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got it.</v>

2869
02:04:39.720 --> 02:04:42.600
<v Speaker 4>But even that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I was emailing with,</v>

2870
02:04:43.240 --> 02:04:47.220
<v Speaker 4>I was emailing with Robb Wolf,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the big Paleo guy and it's like,</v>

2871
02:04:47.640 --> 02:04:52.640
<v Speaker 4>you know how much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of shit that vegans and </v>

2872
02:04:52.640 --> 02:04:54.741
<v Speaker 4>Paleo people could have in common when </v>
<v Speaker 4>it comes down to like hating factory </v>

2873
02:04:54.741 --> 02:04:56.810
<v Speaker 4>farms or like trying to get like the </v>
<v Speaker 4>healthiest like that,</v>

2874
02:04:56.811 --> 02:05:00.180
<v Speaker 4>like animal welfare and like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean eating show many of the,</v>

2875
02:05:00.210 --> 02:05:05.210
<v Speaker 4>these Paleo guys are like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the majority of what you're eating </v>

2876
02:05:05.210 --> 02:05:05.210
<v Speaker 4>should be fucking vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

2877
02:05:05.210 --> 02:05:05.210
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

2878
02:05:05.220 --> 02:05:06.050
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

2879
02:05:06.051 --> 02:05:11.051
<v Speaker 4>and they're just talking about health </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they are talking about animal </v>

2880
02:05:11.051 --> 02:05:11.051
<v Speaker 4>welfare and that's so fascinating where </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

2881
02:05:11.051 --> 02:05:15.470
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those conversations will never fucking </v>

2882
02:05:15.470 --> 02:05:15.470
<v Speaker 4>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2883
02:05:15.470 --> 02:05:15.470
<v Speaker 4>what we've done,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a real problem,</v>

2884
02:05:15.470 --> 02:05:18.780
<v Speaker 4>is jam too many people into a small area</v>
<v Speaker 4>where there's no one growing any food.</v>

2885
02:05:19.050 --> 02:05:24.050
<v Speaker 4>And so to solve that problem,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've figured out how to consolidate </v>

2886
02:05:24.050 --> 02:05:26.850
<v Speaker 4>massive amounts of growing into these </v>
<v Speaker 4>areas.</v>

2887
02:05:27.030 --> 02:05:32.030
<v Speaker 4>Both agriculture in terms of like </v>
<v Speaker 4>vegetables and grains and animals.</v>

2888
02:05:32.460 --> 02:05:34.500
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's all fucking gross.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

2889
02:05:34.501 --> 02:05:39.501
<v Speaker 4>What they do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way they grow vegetables is totally </v>

2890
02:05:39.501 --> 02:05:42.321
<v Speaker 4>unnatural.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not supposed to have a gigantic </v>

2891
02:05:42.321 --> 02:05:42.321
<v Speaker 4>swath of land.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

2892
02:05:42.321 --> 02:05:42.321
<v Speaker 4>It's only dedicated to wheat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2893
02:05:42.321 --> 02:05:44.370
<v Speaker 4>and then all the steroids that they give</v>
<v Speaker 4>the do.</v>

2894
02:05:44.430 --> 02:05:49.430
<v Speaker 4>I saw a picture of a cow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ones that I couldn't stand up because I </v>

2895
02:05:49.430 --> 02:05:49.560
<v Speaker 4>could utter was so fucking big.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like Wayne down.</v>

2896
02:05:49.561 --> 02:05:52.860
<v Speaker 4>Like that shit is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's actually a misconception.</v>

2897
02:05:53.420 --> 02:05:56.880
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very rare that they put steroids in</v>

2898
02:05:57.120 --> 02:05:58.300
<v Speaker 4>cows.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what is it?</v>

2899
02:05:58.350 --> 02:06:03.120
<v Speaker 4>What they do do is they put a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>antibiotics in the cows because the cows</v>

2900
02:06:03.121 --> 02:06:08.121
<v Speaker 4>are eating things that they're not </v>
<v Speaker 4>supposed to be eating like grain and </v>

2901
02:06:08.121 --> 02:06:11.181
<v Speaker 4>they get really sick and they're doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>that to fatten them up to make it </v>

2902
02:06:11.181 --> 02:06:11.181
<v Speaker 4>bigger.</v>

2903
02:06:11.181 --> 02:06:11.181
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

2904
02:06:11.181 --> 02:06:12.510
<v Speaker 4>And also that grain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could feasibly feed two people.</v>

2905
02:06:12.570 --> 02:06:13.620
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can.</v>

2906
02:06:13.621 --> 02:06:18.621
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm also the thing which was people </v>

2907
02:06:18.621 --> 02:06:19.350
<v Speaker 4>don't want to eat grass,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the yield is much higher.</v>

2908
02:06:19.380 --> 02:06:20.970
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they can get a cow,</v>

2909
02:06:20.971 --> 02:06:24.480
<v Speaker 4>they come to market quicker,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they grow faster,</v>

2910
02:06:24.600 --> 02:06:27.840
<v Speaker 4>but there are unhealthy there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you get a marbled steak,</v>

2911
02:06:28.190 --> 02:06:33.190
<v Speaker 4>like what's that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why goo stuff that people cherish and </v>

2912
02:06:33.190 --> 02:06:34.680
<v Speaker 4>love that Wagyu steak.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm the wrong person to ask,</v>

2913
02:06:34.681 --> 02:06:35.570
<v Speaker 4>but.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well it's.</v>

2914
02:06:35.580 --> 02:06:37.890
<v Speaker 4>It's a really obese cow as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2915
02:06:38.340 --> 02:06:42.740
<v Speaker 4>But if you eat grain and you're a cow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what happens to your basket.</v>

2916
02:06:42.750 --> 02:06:46.230
<v Speaker 4>I'll just get fat and gross chicken is </v>
<v Speaker 4>another one.</v>

2917
02:06:46.231 --> 02:06:49.170
<v Speaker 4>People always think the chickens are </v>
<v Speaker 4>getting pumped up with steroids.</v>

2918
02:06:49.530 --> 02:06:53.400
<v Speaker 4>Steroids are expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What would they do with chickens is it's</v>

2919
02:06:53.401 --> 02:06:58.401
<v Speaker 4>really a breeding thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just like the way you make a </v>

2920
02:06:58.401 --> 02:06:58.401
<v Speaker 4>bulldog or the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2921
02:06:58.401 --> 02:07:00.090
<v Speaker 4>how do you improve the biggest massive.</v>

2922
02:07:00.330 --> 02:07:03.090
<v Speaker 4>They take the biggest animals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they breed them with the biggest animals</v>

2923
02:07:03.091 --> 02:07:08.091
<v Speaker 4>and they've gotten to this position </v>
<v Speaker 4>where these chickens are so fucked up </v>

2924
02:07:08.091 --> 02:07:10.650
<v Speaker 4>because they bred them to be so large </v>
<v Speaker 4>they can't even stand up.</v>

2925
02:07:10.680 --> 02:07:15.680
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When they're like a clause like mold </v>

2926
02:07:15.680 --> 02:07:16.510
<v Speaker 4>around the cage and they're jammed into </v>
<v Speaker 4>these little areas to tough,</v>

2927
02:07:16.550 --> 02:07:20.070
<v Speaker 4>but then on top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the real issue is that these animals are</v>

2928
02:07:20.071 --> 02:07:22.560
<v Speaker 4>on top of each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're living in each other's shit.</v>

2929
02:07:22.561 --> 02:07:24.360
<v Speaker 4>They get sick all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2930
02:07:24.370 --> 02:07:26.970
<v Speaker 4>That was that super chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That chicken is actually healthy,</v>

2931
02:07:27.030 --> 02:07:28.740
<v Speaker 4>but by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you see it walk around.</v>

2932
02:07:28.741 --> 02:07:31.530
<v Speaker 4>That's just an enormous large breed of </v>
<v Speaker 4>chicken.</v>

2933
02:07:31.531 --> 02:07:33.600
<v Speaker 4>That chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sesame street character.</v>

2934
02:07:33.630 --> 02:07:36.110
<v Speaker 4>It's a perspective issue too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure if you were standing next to it</v>

2935
02:07:36.130 --> 02:07:37.860
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't look as big,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I mean,</v>

2936
02:07:37.900 --> 02:07:38.890
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's Turkeys.</v>

2937
02:07:38.891 --> 02:07:40.690
<v Speaker 4>Turkeys are pretty big,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the,</v>

2938
02:07:40.691 --> 02:07:42.760
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the real issue is antibiotics.</v>

2939
02:07:42.761 --> 02:07:46.030
<v Speaker 4>Antibiotics is a huge issue because </v>
<v Speaker 4>those antibiotics are,</v>

2940
02:07:46.510 --> 02:07:49.420
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get these animals like pigs.</v>

2941
02:07:49.720 --> 02:07:51.010
<v Speaker 4>The worst is pigs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2942
02:07:51.011 --> 02:07:54.150
<v Speaker 4>because pigs are fucking smart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At least chickens or reptile.</v>

2943
02:07:54.290 --> 02:07:55.570
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're birds.</v>

2944
02:07:56.170 --> 02:07:58.720
<v Speaker 2>They're brains are fucking tiny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Baby pigs are like.</v>

2945
02:07:58.721 --> 02:07:59.980
<v Speaker 2>Poppies are so cute.</v>

2946
02:08:00.350 --> 02:08:05.350
<v Speaker 4>Heard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a Glenn Greenwald article </v>

2947
02:08:05.350 --> 02:08:08.570
<v Speaker 4>recently that he published about these </v>
<v Speaker 4>people that got arrested because they </v>

2948
02:08:08.941 --> 02:08:13.941
<v Speaker 4>adopted these pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They actually stole these pigs from a </v>

2949
02:08:13.941 --> 02:08:14.340
<v Speaker 4>factory farm and nurse them back to </v>
<v Speaker 4>health,</v>

2950
02:08:14.670 --> 02:08:17.070
<v Speaker 4>but in doing so and them getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>arrested,</v>

2951
02:08:17.100 --> 02:08:20.450
<v Speaker 4>expose the horrific conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

2952
02:08:20.490 --> 02:08:25.230
<v Speaker 4>FBI's hunt for two missing piglets </v>
<v Speaker 4>reveals the federal cover up of barbaric</v>

2953
02:08:25.231 --> 02:08:30.231
<v Speaker 4>factory farms and that is a real cover </v>
<v Speaker 4>up because it's money and that's why </v>

2954
02:08:30.231 --> 02:08:32.130
<v Speaker 4>they have what they call ag gag laws and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure you're aware of these.</v>

2955
02:08:32.400 --> 02:08:37.020
<v Speaker 4>These AG gag laws are fucking insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where they make it illegal for people to</v>

2956
02:08:37.021 --> 02:08:42.021
<v Speaker 4>take footage and film what's going on in</v>
<v Speaker 4>these factory farms because they think </v>

2957
02:08:42.021 --> 02:08:43.400
<v Speaker 4>they will negatively impact the business</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the farm.</v>

2958
02:08:43.480 --> 02:08:43.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2959
02:08:43.991 --> 02:08:45.440
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes it will.</v>

2960
02:08:45.580 --> 02:08:48.420
<v Speaker 2>Because you're fucking break here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your main.</v>

2961
02:08:48.550 --> 02:08:50.490
<v Speaker 2>You're denying people information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2962
02:08:50.500 --> 02:08:52.630
<v Speaker 2>and that deny people information like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2963
02:08:53.170 --> 02:08:54.970
<v Speaker 2>That was one of those issues that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think I.</v>

2964
02:08:55.060 --> 02:09:00.060
<v Speaker 2>I think will potter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I knew a couple of those guys </v>

2965
02:09:00.060 --> 02:09:00.060
<v Speaker 2>because mercy for animals has done a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch of those,</v>

2966
02:09:00.060 --> 02:09:03.430
<v Speaker 2>like undercover operations and stuff and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one of those things that again,</v>

2967
02:09:03.431 --> 02:09:05.740
<v Speaker 2>that that should bring together both </v>
<v Speaker 2>sides.</v>

2968
02:09:06.650 --> 02:09:09.220
<v Speaker 2>We're all eating these animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2969
02:09:09.280 --> 02:09:11.830
<v Speaker 2>Or you're Vegan and you're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>stop this,</v>

2970
02:09:11.831 --> 02:09:14.020
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one for the most part,</v>

2971
02:09:14.021 --> 02:09:19.021
<v Speaker 2>it's like a fucking monster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one is like asking for like a </v>

2972
02:09:19.021 --> 02:09:21.601
<v Speaker 2>tortured animal like this who's like </v>
<v Speaker 2>rolling around in their own feces where </v>

2973
02:09:21.601 --> 02:09:23.320
<v Speaker 2>it's like everybody has the right to </v>
<v Speaker 2>know this.</v>

2974
02:09:23.321 --> 02:09:28.321
<v Speaker 2>This is something that I think the Vegan</v>
<v Speaker 2>community can be very mainstream about </v>

2975
02:09:28.321 --> 02:09:32.390
<v Speaker 2>and should get a lot of support and </v>
<v Speaker 2>greenwald to always been like a softie </v>

2976
02:09:32.390 --> 02:09:35.581
<v Speaker 2>for animals too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he does all of his like snowden </v>

2977
02:09:35.581 --> 02:09:38.341
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but dude has like 15 rescue dogs in </v>

2978
02:09:38.341 --> 02:09:38.341
<v Speaker 2>Brazil and he loves animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I'm,</v>

2979
02:09:38.341 --> 02:09:40.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad this is getting coverage from </v>
<v Speaker 2>these guys.</v>

2980
02:09:40.430 --> 02:09:43.090
<v Speaker 4>Getting coverage too and Kudos to him </v>
<v Speaker 4>for putting that out.</v>

2981
02:09:43.120 --> 02:09:43.870
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>

2982
02:09:44.920 --> 02:09:49.920
<v Speaker 4>he's highlighting something that's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>real issue and that if that issue is </v>

2983
02:09:49.920 --> 02:09:54.250
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a concerted effort to deny </v>

2984
02:09:54.250 --> 02:09:56.461
<v Speaker 4>people information because that </v>
<v Speaker 4>information would change the way they </v>

2985
02:09:56.461 --> 02:09:57.050
<v Speaker 4>feel about the food they eat and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

2986
02:09:57.070 --> 02:10:02.070
<v Speaker 4>the argument is that these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have to have these conditions </v>

2987
02:10:02.070 --> 02:10:06.390
<v Speaker 4>because this is the only way to give </v>
<v Speaker 4>people food very cheaply because you </v>

2988
02:10:06.390 --> 02:10:07.490
<v Speaker 4>have to feed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2989
02:10:07.540 --> 02:10:09.610
<v Speaker 4>20 million people in Los Angeles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I don't,</v>

2990
02:10:09.670 --> 02:10:11.710
<v Speaker 4>I don't buy that article,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't buy that argument.</v>

2991
02:10:12.080 --> 02:10:14.830
<v Speaker 4>I think this is just how it's convenient</v>
<v Speaker 4>to run.</v>

2992
02:10:14.831 --> 02:10:15.000
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2993
02:10:15.310 --> 02:10:16.600
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you also look at like,</v>

2994
02:10:16.601 --> 02:10:19.030
<v Speaker 2>what's the Shit we actually do subsidize</v>
<v Speaker 2>for poor people?</v>

2995
02:10:19.031 --> 02:10:24.031
<v Speaker 2>It's garbage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like coke and like processed food </v>

2996
02:10:24.031 --> 02:10:24.220
<v Speaker 2>and it's like subsidized corn as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2997
02:10:24.460 --> 02:10:26.620
<v Speaker 2>but even that isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not the best thing for,</v>

2998
02:10:26.621 --> 02:10:31.621
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially like when it turns into like </v>

2999
02:10:31.621 --> 02:10:33.781
<v Speaker 2>high fructose corn syrup and shit like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that where it's like people need to be </v>

3000
02:10:33.781 --> 02:10:37.651
<v Speaker 2>educated doctors or barely educated </v>
<v Speaker 2>about nutrition and health and if we </v>

3001
02:10:37.651 --> 02:10:41.471
<v Speaker 2>actually had healthy food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it be meat or vegetables or </v>

3002
02:10:41.471 --> 02:10:44.681
<v Speaker 2>whatever in these food deserts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's why I always got mad when </v>

3003
02:10:44.841 --> 02:10:45.680
<v Speaker 2>people were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3004
02:10:45.681 --> 02:10:47.960
<v Speaker 2>look at that fucking fat person on food </v>
<v Speaker 2>stamps.</v>

3005
02:10:47.970 --> 02:10:52.970
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well it's not because they're like </v>

3006
02:10:52.970 --> 02:10:54.280
<v Speaker 2>eating a ton of grass fed beef.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's because like they're fucking food </v>

3007
02:10:54.280 --> 02:10:58.151
<v Speaker 2>stamps can buy them and serial and Mac </v>
<v Speaker 2>and cheese boxes and shit like that.</v>

3008
02:10:58.820 --> 02:10:59.930
<v Speaker 2>But that's another thing where it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3009
02:10:59.931 --> 02:11:01.880
<v Speaker 2>well that's not a conversation we have </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we go,</v>

3010
02:11:01.881 --> 02:11:06.240
<v Speaker 2>you're either on the Vegan side or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Saturday or the pro government or your,</v>

3011
02:11:06.241 --> 02:11:08.810
<v Speaker 2>your antigovernment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like there are answers.</v>

3012
02:11:08.811 --> 02:11:13.811
<v Speaker 2>I feel like if people put their heads </v>
<v Speaker 2>together and weren't just trying to get </v>

3013
02:11:13.811 --> 02:11:13.811
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3014
02:11:13.811 --> 02:11:18.080
<v Speaker 2>the guy who used the wrong pejorative </v>
<v Speaker 2>fired from the New Yorker or whatever.</v>

3015
02:11:19.590 --> 02:11:21.660
<v Speaker 4>It's again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just like everything else.</v>

3016
02:11:21.750 --> 02:11:24.810
<v Speaker 4>There's more information available now </v>
<v Speaker 4>than ever before.</v>

3017
02:11:25.070 --> 02:11:27.900
<v Speaker 4>And I think more people are aware of </v>
<v Speaker 4>this information.</v>

3018
02:11:28.350 --> 02:11:31.680
<v Speaker 4>It's just so many people are distracted </v>
<v Speaker 4>by nonsense all day.</v>

3019
02:11:31.890 --> 02:11:32.540
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>airport and she's talking on the phone </v>
<v Speaker 4>about the most inane bullshit.</v>

<v Speaker 4>She's talking about amazing race and </v>
<v Speaker 4>amazing,</v>

3025

<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The teams on amazing race are just not,</v>

3026
02:11:49.170 --> 02:11:52.050
<v Speaker 4>they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm so annoyed with them so I'm not even</v>

3027
02:11:52.051 --> 02:11:53.370
<v Speaker 4>watching it anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but oh my God,</v>

<v Speaker 4>amazing Chiro and this is blah,</v>

3031
02:11:58.920 --> 02:11:59.340
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>blah.</v>

3032
02:11:59.341 --> 02:12:01.260
<v Speaker 4>And I'm supposed to be getting this </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing at work,</v>

3033
02:12:01.261 --> 02:12:06.261
<v Speaker 4>but know so far my pay increase hasn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>come through and when it comes through </v>

3034

<v Speaker 4>I'm going to save up my money and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to get this thing so mattered.</v>

3035
02:12:10.560 --> 02:12:12.260
<v Speaker 4>But this is what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3036
02:12:12.270 --> 02:12:14.500
<v Speaker 4>this is the average person's life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just,</v>

3037
02:12:14.520 --> 02:12:17.280
<v Speaker 4>they get distracted by nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They talk about bullshit.</v>

3038
02:12:17.281 --> 02:12:18.870
<v Speaker 4>They're watching stupidity.</v>

3039
02:12:18.980 --> 02:12:20.160
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard because it's getting,</v>

3040
02:12:20.190 --> 02:12:25.190
<v Speaker 2>it's getting fed to you and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people aren't doing what they actually </v>

3041
02:12:25.190 --> 02:12:26.670
<v Speaker 2>want to do and they don't believe they </v>
<v Speaker 2>can.</v>

3042
02:12:26.671 --> 02:12:31.671
<v Speaker 2>Actually do it and and they go to </v>
<v Speaker 2>college because they're told they're </v>

3043
02:12:31.671 --> 02:12:33.360
<v Speaker 2>supposed to go to college and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're riddled and student debt so they</v>

3044
02:12:33.361 --> 02:12:35.870
<v Speaker 2>get a job they hate that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll stick into it.</v>

3045
02:12:35.970 --> 02:12:40.970
<v Speaker 4>Point was what I was going to get to was</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you in your obsession with twitter </v>

3046
02:12:41.180 --> 02:12:42.370
<v Speaker 4>and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

3047
02:12:42.430 --> 02:12:47.430
<v Speaker 4>you're being addicted to it and </v>
<v Speaker 4>constantly checking in on it and going </v>

3048
02:12:47.430 --> 02:12:50.981
<v Speaker 4>back to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was your distraction because my </v>

3049
02:12:50.981 --> 02:12:53.711
<v Speaker 4>first one was finding distractions in </v>
<v Speaker 4>stupid television shows and bad food to </v>

3050
02:12:53.711 --> 02:12:57.170
<v Speaker 4>eat and nonsensical raises at work and </v>
<v Speaker 4>because of that,</v>

3051
02:12:57.590 --> 02:13:01.940
<v Speaker 4>this occupies so much of your time </v>
<v Speaker 4>between your job and your family and all</v>

3052
02:13:01.941 --> 02:13:06.941
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't have time to think about </v>

3053
02:13:06.941 --> 02:13:06.941
<v Speaker 4>factory farming</v>

3054
02:13:06.941 --> 02:13:09.500
<v Speaker 2>totally well and even now I can judge </v>
<v Speaker 2>that girl when I was doing the same </v>

3055
02:13:09.500 --> 02:13:11.010
<v Speaker 2>thing on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I could feel like well minds for the</v>

3056
02:13:11.011 --> 02:13:13.920
<v Speaker 2>cause.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mine's not for minds,</v>

3057
02:13:14.010 --> 02:13:18.480
<v Speaker 2>not for the amazing race minds like for </v>
<v Speaker 2>equal whatever.</v>

3058
02:13:18.481 --> 02:13:19.670
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well it's not,</v>

3059
02:13:19.700 --> 02:13:21.240
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not making a difference.</v>

3060
02:13:21.241 --> 02:13:23.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm just doing it for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a,</v>

3061
02:13:23.260 --> 02:13:24.480
<v Speaker 2>a little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a fav.</v>

3062
02:13:24.540 --> 02:13:27.330
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even have a fucking twitter </v>
<v Speaker 2>followers to be addicted to twitter.</v>

3063
02:13:28.150 --> 02:13:30.030
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't mean you don't mean having </v>
<v Speaker 4>followers,</v>

3064
02:13:30.070 --> 02:13:35.070
<v Speaker 4>not what makes you did and anybody can </v>
<v Speaker 4>engage with a large group of followers </v>

3065
02:13:35.070 --> 02:13:39.891
<v Speaker 4>just by saying something mean to someone</v>
<v Speaker 4>like Glenn Greenwald or someone who has </v>

3066
02:13:40.861 --> 02:13:45.861
<v Speaker 4>a lot of followers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not hard to do glen get shit from </v>

3067
02:13:45.861 --> 02:13:46.260
<v Speaker 4>all sides,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all sides.</v>

3068
02:13:46.261 --> 02:13:48.390
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>once the Edward Snowden thing came out,</v>

3069
02:13:48.391 --> 02:13:50.270
<v Speaker 4>he became a lightning rod for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3070
02:13:50.340 --> 02:13:52.050
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of people like that.</v>

3071
02:13:52.051 --> 02:13:53.340
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of people that are doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

3072
02:13:53.341 --> 02:13:55.050
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

3073
02:13:55.070 --> 02:14:00.070
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a unique time for the distribution </v>

3074
02:14:00.070 --> 02:14:03.021
<v Speaker 4>of information.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a unique time because we have to </v>

3075
02:14:03.021 --> 02:14:05.790
<v Speaker 4>sort out ourselves how we manage this </v>
<v Speaker 4>information and where it's,</v>

3076
02:14:06.230 --> 02:14:07.370
<v Speaker 4>how it's kitten in man</v>

3077
02:14:07.650 --> 02:14:12.650
<v Speaker 2>say like once I just sort of started </v>
<v Speaker 2>focusing on in a weird way being </v>

3078
02:14:13.831 --> 02:14:15.060
<v Speaker 2>selfish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like whereas like,</v>

3079
02:14:15.061 --> 02:14:20.061
<v Speaker 2>how can I just be a better person?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You end up that like,</v>

3080
02:14:20.130 --> 02:14:21.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can I better myself?</v>

3081
02:14:21.301 --> 02:14:23.730
<v Speaker 2>You end up being a better person where </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3082
02:14:23.790 --> 02:14:28.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what's going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who's getting arrested </v>

3083
02:14:28.790 --> 02:14:29.040
<v Speaker 2>right now for the Russia thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm like,</v>

3084
02:14:29.370 --> 02:14:34.370
<v Speaker 2>I know that like I'm picking my </v>
<v Speaker 2>girlfriend up from work after I like do </v>

3085
02:14:34.370 --> 02:14:34.800
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of Jujitsu at like a dope gym,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3086
02:14:34.801 --> 02:14:36.450
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of fine with that,</v>

3087
02:14:36.780 --> 02:14:38.460
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3088
02:14:38.580 --> 02:14:40.500
<v Speaker 2>I think it's just a healthier way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking live.</v>

3089
02:14:40.890 --> 02:14:41.370
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3090
02:14:41.371 --> 02:14:43.100
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're talking about yourself and your,</v>

3091
02:14:43.120 --> 02:14:48.120
<v Speaker 4>you're talking about your own sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>management of your life where it had </v>

3092
02:14:48.421 --> 02:14:53.421
<v Speaker 4>gone completely off the rails and now </v>
<v Speaker 4>you've got it back on track and you're </v>

3093
02:14:53.421 --> 02:14:57.051
<v Speaker 4>feeling yourself in a good place to </v>
<v Speaker 4>health and now it's like maybe there is </v>

3094
02:14:57.051 --> 02:14:57.051
<v Speaker 4>a middle ground.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3095
02:14:57.051 --> 02:14:57.051
<v Speaker 4>And maybe there isn't</v>

3096
02:14:57.051 --> 02:15:01.230
<v Speaker 2>way that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if I start doing shows again I can </v>

3097
02:15:01.230 --> 02:15:01.980
<v Speaker 2>like be on twitter and I'll be a douche </v>
<v Speaker 2>bag.</v>

3098
02:15:02.120 --> 02:15:03.350
<v Speaker 4>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you definitely can.</v>

3099
02:15:03.410 --> 02:15:07.490
<v Speaker 4>And I think that having this negative </v>
<v Speaker 4>experience and getting through it,</v>

3100
02:15:08.900 --> 02:15:11.510
<v Speaker 4>that's how you learn and grow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean these bad,</v>

3101
02:15:11.840 --> 02:15:15.560
<v Speaker 4>these big moments are big opportunities </v>
<v Speaker 4>for growth.</v>

3102
02:15:15.620 --> 02:15:19.280
<v Speaker 4>Whereas the same grind day in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>day out,</v>

3103
02:15:19.281 --> 02:15:21.050
<v Speaker 4>you become like the Gal at the airport,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

3104
02:15:21.051 --> 02:15:26.051
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these teams and amazing range here and </v>

3105
02:15:26.051 --> 02:15:26.230
<v Speaker 4>nine to put these chairs are their best </v>
<v Speaker 4>churros in their chairs.</v>

3106
02:15:26.231 --> 02:15:29.240
<v Speaker 4>Cheros are dry and boring.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3107
02:15:29.300 --> 02:15:34.300
<v Speaker 4>there's nothing happening.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Having a big moment where all these </v>

3108
02:15:34.300 --> 02:15:37.400
<v Speaker 4>people attacked you and things went </v>
<v Speaker 4>totally wrong.</v>

3109
02:15:37.460 --> 02:15:42.460
<v Speaker 4>It gave you this opportunity for self </v>
<v Speaker 4>reflection and in a way that you're </v>

3110
02:15:42.460 --> 02:15:45.680
<v Speaker 4>really probably were very unlikely to </v>
<v Speaker 4>achieve without this moment.</v>

3111
02:15:45.681 --> 02:15:46.620
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was even going to.</v>

3112
02:15:46.621 --> 02:15:51.621
<v Speaker 4>I was either going to be off the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Brooklyn Bridge or a bigger Douche bag </v>

3113
02:15:51.621 --> 02:15:55.230
<v Speaker 4>and I don't know which one was worse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You were at the all things comedy </v>

3114
02:15:55.230 --> 02:15:55.230
<v Speaker 4>festival.</v>

3115
02:15:55.230 --> 02:15:55.760
<v Speaker 4>You're hanging out with Bert and to </v>
<v Speaker 4>Oregon.</v>

3116
02:15:55.761 --> 02:16:00.020
<v Speaker 4>It was just literally the funniest </v>
<v Speaker 4>people on the planet and [inaudible] are</v>

3117
02:16:00.021 --> 02:16:03.520
<v Speaker 4>like the funniest people on the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Doug on Ari.</v>

3118
02:16:03.770 --> 02:16:04.730
<v Speaker 4>He peed on him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3119
02:16:04.760 --> 02:16:07.010
<v Speaker 4>That might've been the day after I left.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw so mature.</v>

3120
02:16:07.040 --> 02:16:10.530
<v Speaker 4>I definitely saw red friends.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen artistic.</v>

3121
02:16:10.680 --> 02:16:12.020
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw red deck.</v>

3122
02:16:12.021 --> 02:16:13.010
<v Speaker 4>I didn't see DAX.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dax,</v>

3123
02:16:13.011 --> 02:16:15.380
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I was in the wrong circles.</v>

3124
02:16:15.390 --> 02:16:18.560
<v Speaker 4>Ari could have sexually assaulted me </v>
<v Speaker 4>with his Dick by showing me his deck.</v>

3125
02:16:18.810 --> 02:16:20.300
<v Speaker 4>It would be considered some sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3126
02:16:20.360 --> 02:16:23.330
<v Speaker 4>my girlfriend pointed that out when he </v>
<v Speaker 4>came out on stage naked.</v>

3127
02:16:23.331 --> 02:16:28.331
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>would there be women in there that'd be </v>

3128
02:16:28.331 --> 02:16:29.891
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is sexual assault because I saw it </v>

3129
02:16:29.891 --> 02:16:30.370
<v Speaker 4>as a citizen's radio show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You</v>

<v Speaker 3>people would like,</v>

3131
02:16:31.930 --> 02:16:36.930

<v Speaker 3>their fingers would hurt from typing so </v>

3132
02:16:36.930 --> 02:16:37.710

<v Speaker 3>It would fill the comments.</v>

3133
02:16:37.740 --> 02:16:42.740
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't feel good about himself.</v>

<v Speaker 3>we could all be nicer.</v>

3139
02:16:53.890 --> 02:16:57.100
<v Speaker 3>We could all find some sort of a middle </v>

<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 3>listening to Fitzsimons pocket all these</v>

3149
02:17:20.830 --> 02:17:23.150
<v Speaker 3>podcasts about comedy and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

3150
02:17:23.151 --> 02:17:26.560
<v Speaker 3>and thinking about how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3151
02:17:26.561 --> 02:17:28.570
<v Speaker 3>just because I feel like I failed.</v>

3152
02:17:28.570 --> 02:17:33.570
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess I shit on all comics and </v>

3153
02:17:33.570 --> 02:17:33.570
<v Speaker 3>forgetting about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like even the comics,</v>

3154
02:17:33.570 --> 02:17:35.080
<v Speaker 3>you say the most horrific shit on stage </v>
<v Speaker 3>for the most part.</v>

3155
02:17:35.350 --> 02:17:40.350
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of really cool broken </v>
<v Speaker 3>sweet guys who like through all of the </v>

3156
02:17:40.781 --> 02:17:43.690
<v Speaker 3>bullshit had my back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I remember I heard burt,</v>

3157
02:17:44.130 --> 02:17:46.930
<v Speaker 3>I told burt this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think actually on the podcast,</v>

3158
02:17:46.931 --> 02:17:51.931
<v Speaker 3>maybe backstage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I told burt that like I was going </v>

3159
02:17:51.931 --> 02:17:54.451
<v Speaker 3>back and listening to a bunch of his </v>
<v Speaker 3>podcasts and I listened to the one he </v>

3160
02:17:54.451 --> 02:17:56.410
<v Speaker 3>did with metzker because I wanted that </v>
<v Speaker 3>other fucking side to it.</v>

3161
02:17:56.411 --> 02:18:01.411
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the other side's situation was </v>

3162
02:18:01.411 --> 02:18:01.411
<v Speaker 3>fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

3163
02:18:01.450 --> 02:18:01.960
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>

3164
02:18:01.961 --> 02:18:03.520
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if curt wants us to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>known,</v>

3165
02:18:03.521 --> 02:18:08.521
<v Speaker 3>but he was devastated by that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean like really bad loss and hurt a </v>

3166
02:18:08.521 --> 02:18:12.870
<v Speaker 3>lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was super unhealthy mean he felt he </v>

3167
02:18:12.870 --> 02:18:12.870
<v Speaker 3>felt it.</v>

3168
02:18:12.870 --> 02:18:13.090
<v Speaker 3>That he raged.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>

3169
02:18:13.091 --> 02:18:14.320
<v Speaker 3>when they come after you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3170
02:18:14.321 --> 02:18:16.870
<v Speaker 3>and when I heard him on the podcast and </v>
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>

3171
02:18:16.960 --> 02:18:21.960
<v Speaker 3>he gets a little mouthy on facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when I actually heard him on the </v>

3172
02:18:21.960 --> 02:18:21.960
<v Speaker 3>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>articulate what he was talking about,</v>

3173
02:18:21.960 --> 02:18:22.720
<v Speaker 3>where he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3174
02:18:22.721 --> 02:18:24.970
<v Speaker 3>I think this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for people who don't know,</v>

3175
02:18:24.971 --> 02:18:29.971
<v Speaker 3>like some fucking dude at ucb was </v>
<v Speaker 3>accused of rape I think.</v>

3176
02:18:30.420 --> 02:18:33.160
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Kurt essentially said,</v>

3177
02:18:33.520 --> 02:18:37.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he made it sort of in parody saying that</v>

3178
02:18:37.781 --> 02:18:41.350
<v Speaker 3>no woman could ever lie and a woman is </v>
<v Speaker 3>like my Bible.</v>

3179
02:18:41.351 --> 02:18:42.610
<v Speaker 3>It's always true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Yeah.</v>

3180
02:18:42.710 --> 02:18:47.710
<v Speaker 3>But he was also saying that like UCB </v>
<v Speaker 3>said like they did an investigation and </v>

3181
02:18:47.710 --> 02:18:49.750
<v Speaker 3>found this guy guilty and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't,</v>

3182
02:18:49.880 --> 02:18:54.880
<v Speaker 3>you can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't know how to play an Improv </v>

3183
02:18:54.880 --> 02:18:54.880
<v Speaker 3>theater can like yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And their way to the clues.</v>

3184
02:18:54.880 --> 02:18:55.310
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't know how that happened.</v>

3185
02:18:55.370 --> 02:18:56.770
<v Speaker 3>Not Detectives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3186
02:18:56.771 --> 02:19:01.771
<v Speaker 3>but now this dude can fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if he is guilty he can like shoot the </v>

3187
02:19:01.771 --> 02:19:01.810
<v Speaker 3>ucb he like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he can get.</v>

3188
02:19:01.811 --> 02:19:06.811
<v Speaker 3>And that's what Kurt was saying to where</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's worded it poorly and it turns out </v>

3189
02:19:06.811 --> 02:19:11.400
<v Speaker 3>that they believe the guy who is a piece</v>
<v Speaker 3>of shit and curse will be the first to </v>

3190
02:19:11.400 --> 02:19:11.400
<v Speaker 3>say that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So anyway,</v>

3191
02:19:11.400 --> 02:19:13.270
<v Speaker 3>so I listened to badly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3192
02:19:13.271 --> 02:19:18.271
<v Speaker 3>totally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I listened to this interview and </v>

3193
02:19:18.271 --> 02:19:18.271
<v Speaker 3>that has to do with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

3194
02:19:18.271 --> 02:19:19.030
<v Speaker 3>just judging people on the Internet </v>
<v Speaker 3>without facts.</v>

3195
02:19:19.120 --> 02:19:24.120
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I listened to this interview with </v>

3196
02:19:24.120 --> 02:19:26.491
<v Speaker 3>Kurt and burdens really good and I think</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was the first time I heard bird </v>

3197
02:19:26.491 --> 02:19:28.280
<v Speaker 3>show and at the end I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

3198
02:19:28.370 --> 02:19:33.370
<v Speaker 2>alright the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they started talking about me and they </v>

3199
02:19:33.370 --> 02:19:34.490
<v Speaker 2>weren't really wrong about a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff they said.</v>

3200
02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:40.000
<v Speaker 2>And I had this moment where burt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who I only met once,</v>

3201
02:19:40.071 --> 02:19:45.071
<v Speaker 2>we did some weird TV show together and </v>
<v Speaker 2>like Amsterdam and I only met him once </v>

3202
02:19:45.071 --> 02:19:49.750
<v Speaker 2>and he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was going to be like him </v>

3203
02:19:49.750 --> 02:19:50.360
<v Speaker 2>just being like this fucking faggot </v>
<v Speaker 2>feminist because that was the idea I had</v>

3204
02:19:50.361 --> 02:19:51.980
<v Speaker 2>of like all comics and how they thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>about me.</v>

3205
02:19:51.981 --> 02:19:53.480
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was just like,</v>

3206
02:19:53.481 --> 02:19:55.520
<v Speaker 2>yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just bummed out because I remember</v>

3207
02:19:55.521 --> 02:19:58.980
<v Speaker 2>like Jamie was nice and then like it </v>
<v Speaker 2>just like made me sad that he liked,</v>

3208
02:19:59.030 --> 02:20:00.950
<v Speaker 2>didn't stick up for comics and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3209
02:20:01.640 --> 02:20:06.640
<v Speaker 2>it was just like really sweet and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sincere and kind of like even like </v>

3210
02:20:06.640 --> 02:20:10.900
<v Speaker 2>vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I remember turning to my girlfriend </v>

3211
02:20:10.900 --> 02:20:13.311
<v Speaker 2>and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to apologize to Burton more than </v>

3212
02:20:13.311 --> 02:20:13.640
<v Speaker 2>I do these women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He sounded so sincere and sad and I just</v>

3213
02:20:13.641 --> 02:20:15.820
<v Speaker 2>forgot about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that,</v>

3214
02:20:15.830 --> 02:20:18.740
<v Speaker 2>that sort of comic camaraderie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3215
02:20:18.820 --> 02:20:23.820
<v Speaker 4>it's easy to characterize us in just to </v>
<v Speaker 4>lump us into this boarish group of </v>

3216
02:20:24.850 --> 02:20:28.040
<v Speaker 4>asshole men that are massage agnes and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3217
02:20:28.080 --> 02:20:33.080
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you ever see that thing where a Jim </v>

3218
02:20:33.080 --> 02:20:36.390
<v Speaker 4>Norton went on w Kamau bell and that was</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lindy West.</v>

3219
02:20:37.870 --> 02:20:42.870
<v Speaker 4>Lindy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>her characterization of that kind of </v>

3220
02:20:42.870 --> 02:20:44.560
<v Speaker 4>comedy was so caricature issue was so </v>
<v Speaker 4>ridiculous.</v>

3221
02:20:44.630 --> 02:20:45.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

3222
02:20:45.191 --> 02:20:47.310
<v Speaker 2>and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're characatures of like,</v>

3223
02:20:47.390 --> 02:20:50.260
<v Speaker 2>like I know feminists who aren't fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>insane and who like,</v>

3224
02:20:50.300 --> 02:20:55.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like she was wanting it to be a certain </v>

3225
02:20:55.300 --> 02:20:58.061
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of people do because it's </v>

3226
02:20:58.061 --> 02:20:58.370
<v Speaker 2>easier to eliminate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stereotyped and demonized.</v>

3227
02:20:58.371 --> 02:21:00.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because like you know,</v>

3228
02:21:00.490 --> 02:21:03.420
<v Speaker 2>it making that decision where I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

3229
02:21:03.480 --> 02:21:05.660
<v Speaker 2>fucking Rogan hates me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't need to listen to that podcast.</v>

3230
02:21:05.690 --> 02:21:08.360
<v Speaker 2>Like I'll just get the information </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's easier to digest that.</v>

3231
02:21:08.440 --> 02:21:09.620
<v Speaker 2>That's cake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3232
02:21:09.621 --> 02:21:10.190
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cool,</v>

3233
02:21:10.191 --> 02:21:15.191
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to listen to the shows </v>
<v Speaker 2>that agree with me and gave me </v>

3234
02:21:15.191 --> 02:21:15.191
<v Speaker 2>information that says you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're smart,</v>

3235
02:21:15.191 --> 02:21:17.390
<v Speaker 2>you're good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As opposed to the stuff that's like,</v>

3236
02:21:17.450 --> 02:21:18.860
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gotta look that up.</v>

3237
02:21:18.950 --> 02:21:23.950
<v Speaker 2>I have to like think about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to maybe change a behavior of </v>

3238
02:21:23.950 --> 02:21:23.950
<v Speaker 2>mine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3239
02:21:23.950 --> 02:21:26.960
<v Speaker 2>And people do that on both sides and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why it is so important where it's</v>

3240
02:21:26.961 --> 02:21:29.290
<v Speaker 2>like no one is the fucking stereotype of</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything that,</v>

3241
02:21:29.360 --> 02:21:30.800
<v Speaker 2>that people think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3242
02:21:30.801 --> 02:21:31.970
<v Speaker 2>I think we're in a</v>

3243
02:21:31.970 --> 02:21:34.010
<v Speaker 4>boat that's in rocky water,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3244
02:21:34.011 --> 02:21:36.680
<v Speaker 4>And I think it's going to rock left and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's going to rock right.</v>

3245
02:21:36.681 --> 02:21:41.681
<v Speaker 4>And hopefully we're going to right the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ship and we're going to figure out what </v>

3246
02:21:41.681 --> 02:21:44.591
<v Speaker 4>the fuck we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I mean collectively the human race </v>

3247
02:21:44.591 --> 02:21:47.420
<v Speaker 4>has probably never communicated clear </v>
<v Speaker 4>ever and then we do now and it's because</v>

3248
02:21:47.421 --> 02:21:52.421
<v Speaker 4>of our access to information,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's definitely going to be these </v>

3249
02:21:52.421 --> 02:21:53.020
<v Speaker 4>groups of people that so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

3250
02:21:53.021 --> 02:21:58.021
<v Speaker 4>they haul off and they get confirmation </v>
<v Speaker 4>bias and they made sure their walls up </v>

3251
02:21:58.581 --> 02:22:01.430
<v Speaker 4>with this group of likeminded folks in </v>
<v Speaker 4>an echo chamber.</v>

3252
02:22:01.431 --> 02:22:02.690
<v Speaker 4>There's always going to be that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

3253
02:22:02.691 --> 02:22:07.570
<v Speaker 4>But I think that is more obvious for </v>
<v Speaker 4>what it is today than ever before.</v>

3254
02:22:07.610 --> 02:22:09.350
<v Speaker 4>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's a good thing.</v>

3255
02:22:09.351 --> 02:22:12.260
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think that your ability to express</v>

3256
02:22:12.261 --> 02:22:17.261
<v Speaker 4>yourself like this on this podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've been talking now for two and a </v>

3257
02:22:17.261 --> 02:22:17.261
<v Speaker 4>half hours.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She is this.</v>

3258
02:22:17.261 --> 02:22:22.090
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a very unique way to </v>

3259
02:22:22.090 --> 02:22:24.851
<v Speaker 4>communicate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think this is a way to communicate </v>

3260
02:22:24.851 --> 02:22:26.260
<v Speaker 4>where you really get to know somebody </v>
<v Speaker 4>versus someone characterizing</v>

3261
02:22:26.280 --> 02:22:28.290
<v Speaker 3>uses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why have a problem with blogs?</v>

3262
02:22:28.740 --> 02:22:32.520
<v Speaker 3>When someone writes a blog entry on you </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you don't get a chance to respond,</v>

3263
02:22:32.521 --> 02:22:34.200
<v Speaker 3>they don't get a chance to see who you </v>
<v Speaker 3>really are.</v>

3264
02:22:34.220 --> 02:22:36.060
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then when someone like me who's in a</v>

3265
02:22:36.061 --> 02:22:40.770
<v Speaker 3>position to amplify it just reads that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just read it as fact,</v>

3266
02:22:40.771 --> 02:22:42.630
<v Speaker 3>just like you watch the news as fat </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you go,</v>

3267
02:22:42.640 --> 02:22:47.640
<v Speaker 3>well fucking called the news.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why it's interesting to see it </v>

3268
02:22:47.640 --> 02:22:48.270
<v Speaker 3>come back and bite you in the ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3269
02:22:48.430 --> 02:22:50.700
<v Speaker 3>And then see your response and see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You realize like,</v>

3270
02:22:50.760 --> 02:22:55.760
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then go through this essentially in </v>

3271
02:22:55.760 --> 02:22:55.760
<v Speaker 3>exile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>period.</v>

3272
02:22:55.760 --> 02:22:56.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3273
02:22:56.960 --> 02:22:59.340
<v Speaker 3>I mean you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you went a year without performing.</v>

3274
02:22:59.490 --> 02:23:03.730
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's good without talking to </v>
<v Speaker 3>people like without talking to,</v>

3275
02:23:03.840 --> 02:23:05.310
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to comics with,</v>

3276
02:23:05.370 --> 02:23:10.370
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it was also like working on me </v>

3277
02:23:10.370 --> 02:23:13.251
<v Speaker 3>because like I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not like the article was,</v>

3278
02:23:13.320 --> 02:23:18.320
<v Speaker 3>was garbage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not like I wasn't like a </v>

3279
02:23:18.320 --> 02:23:18.320
<v Speaker 3>Shitty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>selfish,</v>

3280
02:23:18.320 --> 02:23:19.710
<v Speaker 3>depressed in a bad spot person.</v>

3281
02:23:20.010 --> 02:23:24.360
<v Speaker 3>Like there were a ton of things I needed</v>
<v Speaker 3>to fucking look at myself and fix.</v>

3282
02:23:24.361 --> 02:23:29.361
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and was I being selfish and wasn't </v>

3283
02:23:29.361 --> 02:23:32.720
<v Speaker 3>making this all about me and was I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's not necessarily an accurate </v>

3284
02:23:32.720 --> 02:23:33.360
<v Speaker 3>characterization of who you are as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>

3285
02:23:33.510 --> 02:23:33.710
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3286
02:23:33.711 --> 02:23:33.870
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3287
02:23:33.871 --> 02:23:34.180
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

3288
02:23:34.200 --> 02:23:37.920
<v Speaker 3>But it was good for me to fix those </v>
<v Speaker 3>other things.</v>

3289
02:23:37.921 --> 02:23:38.400
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3290
02:23:38.401 --> 02:23:43.401
<v Speaker 3>I didn't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was kind of a Douche bag so I can </v>

3291
02:23:43.401 --> 02:23:43.401
<v Speaker 3>fix this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

3292
02:23:43.401 --> 02:23:43.880
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why I,</v>

3293
02:23:43.881 --> 02:23:46.350
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought comics believed that,</v>

3294
02:23:46.620 --> 02:23:49.050
<v Speaker 3>believed that article.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when I was talking to doug and I was</v>

3295
02:23:49.051 --> 02:23:49.980
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't read it.</v>

3296
02:23:50.040 --> 02:23:50.660
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

3297
02:23:50.710 --> 02:23:55.710
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just thought it was funny because </v>

3298
02:23:55.710 --> 02:23:55.710
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was talking to doug and I was like,</v>

3299
02:23:55.710 --> 02:23:55.710
<v Speaker 3>yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3300
02:23:55.710 --> 02:23:55.710
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

3301
02:23:55.710 --> 02:23:55.710
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3302
02:23:55.710 --> 02:23:58.120
<v Speaker 3>I don't really want to apologize because</v>
<v Speaker 3>I reread it and I,</v>

3303
02:23:58.130 --> 02:23:59.100
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's.</v>

3304
02:23:59.100 --> 02:23:59.670
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3305
02:23:59.671 --> 02:23:59.830
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3306
02:23:59.840 --> 02:24:00.080
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3307
02:24:00.100 --> 02:24:05.100
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>none of us think you're a fucking </v>

3308
02:24:05.100 --> 02:24:06.291
<v Speaker 3>predator.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're apologizing for being a Douche </v>

3309
02:24:06.291 --> 02:24:06.291
<v Speaker 3>bag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

3310
02:24:06.291 --> 02:24:06.291
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>

3311
02:24:06.291 --> 02:24:07.170
<v Speaker 3>It was the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the turning on comedy,</v>

3312
02:24:07.171 --> 02:24:10.070
<v Speaker 3>this self righteousness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw the article and I,</v>

3313
02:24:10.071 --> 02:24:15.071
<v Speaker 3>I looked at him like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Damn Joseph is going after Jamie </v>

3314
02:24:15.071 --> 02:24:15.510
<v Speaker 3>Kennedy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I laughed,</v>

3315
02:24:15.511 --> 02:24:18.240
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't think it was real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I felt like,</v>

3316
02:24:18.241 --> 02:24:19.680
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's probably trying to get laid.</v>

3317
02:24:19.890 --> 02:24:24.890
<v Speaker 3>And he said something and someone took </v>
<v Speaker 3>it and turned it into some horrific </v>

3318
02:24:24.890 --> 02:24:28.761
<v Speaker 3>offense against all women and turns out </v>
<v Speaker 3>that he's actually a Predator and you </v>

3319
02:24:28.761 --> 02:24:28.761
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck him,</v>

3320
02:24:28.761 --> 02:24:30.510
<v Speaker 3>he's cast out from the kingdom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3321
02:24:30.511 --> 02:24:31.650
<v Speaker 3>that's just what people do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3322
02:24:31.800 --> 02:24:36.800
<v Speaker 3>And one of the reasons why they do it is</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they're absolutely terrified </v>

3323
02:24:36.800 --> 02:24:37.680
<v Speaker 3>that they themselves are going to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>cast out from the kingdom.</v>

3324
02:24:37.890 --> 02:24:39.540
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have,</v>

3325
02:24:39.720 --> 02:24:41.730
<v Speaker 3>I totally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>totally.</v>

3326
02:24:41.731 --> 02:24:45.720
<v Speaker 3>Because everyone has their shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it is.</v>

3327
02:24:46.050 --> 02:24:51.050
<v Speaker 3>I mean it like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although the Weinstein stuff and the </v>

3328
02:24:51.050 --> 02:24:53.880
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are a lot of due to probably would</v>

3329
02:24:53.881 --> 02:24:56.940
<v Speaker 3>be supporting this more butter just </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3330
02:24:57.000 --> 02:24:57.540
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>

3331
02:24:57.870 --> 02:24:59.970
<v Speaker 3>I flirted with that one girl at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>office,</v>

3332
02:24:59.971 --> 02:25:01.350
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>am I like Weinstein?</v>

3333
02:25:01.351 --> 02:25:06.351
<v Speaker 3>And it's like you can't compare the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mustang because you have to go after </v>

3334
02:25:06.351 --> 02:25:08.280
<v Speaker 3>Weinstein with as much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3335
02:25:08.340 --> 02:25:10.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever vigor,</v>

3336
02:25:10.640 --> 02:25:15.640
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you do not go after the people who </v>

3337
02:25:15.640 --> 02:25:16.440
<v Speaker 3>were fucking flirting with the Weinstein</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

3338
02:25:16.441 --> 02:25:21.441
<v Speaker 3>What's unique about the Weinstein thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>is it is one of the worst cases you </v>

3339
02:25:22.021 --> 02:25:23.070
<v Speaker 3>could imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sort of like,</v>

3340
02:25:23.260 --> 02:25:24.100
<v Speaker 3>the cosby</v>

3341
02:25:24.100 --> 02:25:29.100
<v Speaker 4>thing is to drugging and raping.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like when you read about the number</v>

3342
02:25:29.741 --> 02:25:32.620
<v Speaker 4>of people that are accusing cosby and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>

3343
02:25:32.650 --> 02:25:34.720
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did he rape people for like,</v>

3344
02:25:34.721 --> 02:25:37.930
<v Speaker 4>this is like your full time job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Next to the cosby show is a rapist.</v>

3345
02:25:37.950 --> 02:25:42.950
<v Speaker 4>Somebody characterized him as the worst </v>
<v Speaker 4>serial rape or in human history.</v>

3346
02:25:43.541 --> 02:25:47.200
<v Speaker 4>I heard you say that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That might be real.</v>

3347
02:25:47.410 --> 02:25:49.930
<v Speaker 4>That might be real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he really might be.</v>

3348
02:25:49.931 --> 02:25:52.690
<v Speaker 4>He might have drugged and raped hundreds</v>
<v Speaker 4>of women.</v>

3349
02:25:52.691 --> 02:25:54.730
<v Speaker 4>We don't even know the numbers by the </v>
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>

3350
02:25:54.880 --> 02:25:59.880
<v Speaker 4>That's another fucking example now that </v>
<v Speaker 4>I think about it of what you were just </v>

3351
02:25:59.880 --> 02:26:03.601
<v Speaker 4>saying where the last however many years</v>
<v Speaker 4>he went from comic to lecturing like </v>

3352
02:26:05.740 --> 02:26:10.740
<v Speaker 4>black people about how to wear their </v>
<v Speaker 4>pants and how to articulate and he was </v>

3353
02:26:10.740 --> 02:26:12.160
<v Speaker 4>talking about manners and how to present</v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself and it's like,</v>

3354
02:26:12.340 --> 02:26:14.140
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're covering up drugging them,</v>

3355
02:26:14.141 --> 02:26:16.420
<v Speaker 4>raping people where it's like you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3356
02:26:16.421 --> 02:26:17.090
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>

3357
02:26:17.110 --> 02:26:22.110
<v Speaker 4>That is what bit him in the ass because </v>
<v Speaker 4>Hannibal burress talking about him on </v>

3358
02:26:22.110 --> 02:26:22.110
<v Speaker 4>stage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which in a comic,</v>

3359
02:26:22.110 --> 02:26:26.640
<v Speaker 4>that's what got him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I still can't handle comic saying,</v>

3360
02:26:26.831 --> 02:26:27.310
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

3361
02:26:27.490 --> 02:26:28.810
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you tell me not to swear,</v>

3362
02:26:28.870 --> 02:26:30.380
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at least I'm not out there raping women.</v>

3363
02:26:30.440 --> 02:26:31.950
<v Speaker 4>People were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wait,</v>

3364
02:26:32.020 --> 02:26:33.310
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

3365
02:26:33.450 --> 02:26:35.650
<v Speaker 4>Like the average person didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3366
02:26:35.710 --> 02:26:40.270
<v Speaker 4>I mean I heard about it way back in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>day when I was on Newsradio somebody who</v>

3367
02:26:40.271 --> 02:26:43.450
<v Speaker 4>the fuck just told me the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my friend Curtis,</v>

3368
02:26:43.660 --> 02:26:48.660
<v Speaker 4>my friend Curtis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his mom worked with bill cosby in the 19</v>

3369
02:26:49.530 --> 02:26:54.530
<v Speaker 4>sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the 19 sixties and she was an extra on </v>

3370
02:26:54.641 --> 02:26:58.690
<v Speaker 4>something that bill cosby was doing and </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone pulled her aside and said,</v>

3371
02:26:58.720 --> 02:27:01.120
<v Speaker 4>be careful around him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a fucking creep.</v>

3372
02:27:01.121 --> 02:27:03.380
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He will do something and you know,</v>

3373
02:27:03.400 --> 02:27:07.050
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if they specifically said </v>
<v Speaker 4>that they would drug him or the,</v>

3374
02:27:07.060 --> 02:27:08.170
<v Speaker 4>that he would drag her.</v>

3375
02:27:08.230 --> 02:27:09.730
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>be careful.</v>

3376
02:27:09.731 --> 02:27:14.731
<v Speaker 4>So people that worked with him knew he </v>
<v Speaker 4>was doing creepy shit like drugging </v>

3377
02:27:14.731 --> 02:27:19.321
<v Speaker 4>women in their sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we might be talking literally about </v>

3378
02:27:19.321 --> 02:27:24.061
<v Speaker 4>50 years up dragging rip 50 years of </v>
<v Speaker 4>drugging and raping.</v>

3379
02:27:24.131 --> 02:27:25.780
<v Speaker 4>And he did jokes about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's see.</v>

3380
02:27:25.781 --> 02:27:28.630
<v Speaker 4>I think curtis was talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he had bits about,</v>

3381
02:27:28.750 --> 02:27:32.890
<v Speaker 4>about putting Spanish fly into women's </v>
<v Speaker 4>drinks and about drugging women,</v>

3382
02:27:33.690 --> 02:27:35.740
<v Speaker 4>actual bits about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jesus,</v>

3383
02:27:35.860 --> 02:27:40.860
<v Speaker 4>but he got away with it forever until </v>
<v Speaker 4>this distribution of information that </v>

3384
02:27:40.860 --> 02:27:41.270
<v Speaker 4>we're experiencing now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yay.</v>

3385
02:27:41.280 --> 02:27:46.280
<v Speaker 4>And this is what would cause however you</v>
<v Speaker 4>want and that's why it's good and that's</v>

3386
02:27:46.331 --> 02:27:47.030
<v Speaker 4>why,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3387
02:27:47.050 --> 02:27:50.510
<v Speaker 4>I would never be like a social media is </v>
<v Speaker 4>the problem because you know,</v>

3388
02:27:50.530 --> 02:27:51.510
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3389
02:27:51.511 --> 02:27:56.511
<v Speaker 4>the me too campaign and Harvey Weinstein</v>
<v Speaker 4>and Cosby like it is good that these </v>

3390
02:27:56.511 --> 02:27:59.821
<v Speaker 4>people are being exposed is not good </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you also then go on witch hunts for</v>

3391
02:28:00.190 --> 02:28:04.120
<v Speaker 4>people who like aren't like Dla fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>rapists or whatever.</v>

3392
02:28:04.150 --> 02:28:09.150
<v Speaker 4>Well that's the difference and this is </v>
<v Speaker 4>the thing that a lot of men like they </v>

3393
02:28:09.150 --> 02:28:10.360
<v Speaker 4>see the Harvey Weinstein thing and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>start thinking about themselves and go,</v>

3394
02:28:10.361 --> 02:28:15.361
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what if every girl that I ever tried to </v>

<v Speaker 4>had a couple of drinks together.</v>

3399
02:28:22.250 --> 02:28:23.670
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3400
02:28:23.720 --> 02:28:27.230

<v Speaker 3>crazy addiction to doing that to women.</v>

3415
02:29:03.860 --> 02:29:06.510
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't just simply like he was trying</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get laid off.</v>

02:29:19.841 --> 02:29:21.350
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wanted to stick his dick in the mouth</v>

3423
02:29:21.351 --> 02:29:25.040
<v Speaker 3>of the woman who was in the movie and </v>
<v Speaker 3>know what he's watching the movie I came</v>

3424
02:29:25.041 --> 02:29:25.880
<v Speaker 3>in her mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did that.</v>

3425
02:29:27.320 --> 02:29:30.110
<v Speaker 3>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to get that rich.</v>

3426
02:29:30.140 --> 02:29:35.140
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It also was this new one accused of </v>

3427
02:29:35.140 --> 02:29:37.280
<v Speaker 3>raping employee in the Seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh God.</v>

3428
02:29:37.850 --> 02:29:42.850
<v Speaker 3>As more women come forward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a Goddamn rape fest out there.</v>

3429
02:29:43.490 --> 02:29:45.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's,</v>

3430
02:29:46.790 --> 02:29:48.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's horrible.</v>

3431
02:29:48.530 --> 02:29:51.560
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it also reinforces a lot of negative</v>

3432
02:29:51.561 --> 02:29:56.561
<v Speaker 3>ideas that women have about men too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's another part of the problem is </v>

3433
02:29:56.561 --> 02:29:56.561
<v Speaker 3>that they would go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

3434
02:29:56.561 --> 02:29:56.561
<v Speaker 3>we were right.</v>

3435
02:29:56.690 --> 02:29:57.790
<v Speaker 3>There is a rape culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>

3436
02:29:57.791 --> 02:29:58.550
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're right.</v>

3437
02:29:58.551 --> 02:29:59.270
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>men do.</v>

3438
02:29:59.271 --> 02:30:00.470
<v Speaker 3>I'll do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3439
02:30:00.471 --> 02:30:05.270
<v Speaker 3>and I think if people could actually go </v>
<v Speaker 3>after these rapists,</v>

3440
02:30:05.420 --> 02:30:08.570
<v Speaker 3>then again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>same thing with all of the middle ground</v>

3441
02:30:08.571 --> 02:30:10.010
<v Speaker 3>issues we were kind of finding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3442
02:30:10.011 --> 02:30:10.760
<v Speaker 3>Where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3443
02:30:10.761 --> 02:30:15.410
<v Speaker 3>let's go after the actual bad guys and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then not make,</v>

3444
02:30:16.220 --> 02:30:21.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there's a day where there's not a </v>

3445
02:30:21.220 --> 02:30:21.220
<v Speaker 3>rapist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>instead of like looking,</v>

3446
02:30:21.220 --> 02:30:24.760
<v Speaker 3>I mean statistically I'm probably wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like looking for like who can we </v>

3447
02:30:24.760 --> 02:30:25.190
<v Speaker 3>even be mad at for being sexist?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just go enjoy the day,</v>

3448
02:30:25.850 --> 02:30:27.890
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like um,</v>

3449
02:30:28.760 --> 02:30:31.400
<v Speaker 3>there doesn't always have to be a new </v>
<v Speaker 3>bad guy.</v>

3450
02:30:31.430 --> 02:30:36.430
<v Speaker 3>Like you can just like go after the </v>
<v Speaker 3>legit fucking predators and,</v>

3451
02:30:36.431 --> 02:30:36.920
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

3452
02:30:36.990 --> 02:30:37.520
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

3453
02:30:37.580 --> 02:30:40.610
<v Speaker 3>and rapists and there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's plenty of actual real targets.</v>

3454
02:30:41.150 --> 02:30:41.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3455
02:30:41.571 --> 02:30:42.330
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We talked to you.</v>

3456
02:30:42.331 --> 02:30:43.660
<v Speaker 3>You don't need to invent that.</v>

3457
02:30:43.660 --> 02:30:48.660
<v Speaker 3>And also like is that the thing to do or</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the thing to do to try to educate </v>

3458
02:30:48.660 --> 02:30:51.740
<v Speaker 3>humans is to how to behave with each </v>
<v Speaker 3>other and that this,</v>

3459
02:30:51.750 --> 02:30:56.750
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the reasons why this was he got </v>

3460
02:30:56.750 --> 02:31:00.041
<v Speaker 3>away with it is because he had this </v>
<v Speaker 3>extreme amount of power to control the </v>

3461
02:31:00.041 --> 02:31:03.341
<v Speaker 3>future of these women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just that that's how he got away </v>

3462
02:31:03.341 --> 02:31:06.191
<v Speaker 3>with getting them to do these things and</v>
<v Speaker 3>keep their mouth shut because he held </v>

3463
02:31:06.191 --> 02:31:09.170
<v Speaker 3>this incredible power over them because </v>
<v Speaker 3>he could control their future career.</v>

3464
02:31:09.171 --> 02:31:14.171
<v Speaker 3>He had the money and the influence to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get them and give them the career that </v>

3465
02:31:14.171 --> 02:31:14.770
<v Speaker 3>they desire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3466
02:31:14.780 --> 02:31:17.360
<v Speaker 3>It was that legit casting couch cliche.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just like,</v>

3467
02:31:17.361 --> 02:31:17.900
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was real.</v>

3468
02:31:17.901 --> 02:31:20.130
<v Speaker 3>And it was him and it was girls Whitney.</v>

3469
02:31:20.130 --> 02:31:23.640
<v Speaker 4>Cummings knows people that know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the,</v>

3470
02:31:23.641 --> 02:31:25.050
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the whole inside story.</v>

3471
02:31:25.051 --> 02:31:26.410
<v Speaker 4>And she,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what she said is like,</v>

3472
02:31:26.430 --> 02:31:28.890
<v Speaker 4>what you're hearing is all the women </v>
<v Speaker 4>that said no.</v>

3473
02:31:29.340 --> 02:31:34.340
<v Speaker 4>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you know how many famous women said </v>

3474
02:31:34.340 --> 02:31:34.340
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like graduating,</v>

3475
02:31:34.340 --> 02:31:34.340
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to ask you mean,</v>

3476
02:31:34.340 --> 02:31:35.880
<v Speaker 4>oh no data.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because it was a deal.</v>

3477
02:31:35.881 --> 02:31:38.190
<v Speaker 4>They made a deal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is how I get the leading part.</v>

3478
02:31:38.400 --> 02:31:39.680
<v Speaker 4>This is how I get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3479
02:31:39.700 --> 02:31:43.170
<v Speaker 4>a influence over editing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is how I get more lines.</v>

3480
02:31:43.171 --> 02:31:43.710
<v Speaker 4>So sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get.</v>

3481
02:31:43.711 --> 02:31:46.200
<v Speaker 4>And that literally he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they negotiated this.</v>

3482
02:31:46.650 --> 02:31:51.650
<v Speaker 4>She said he literally would negotiate </v>
<v Speaker 4>certain aspects of their careers with </v>

3483
02:31:52.050 --> 02:31:57.050
<v Speaker 4>sex and these women did it and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some of them probably be grudgingly and </v>

3484
02:31:57.050 --> 02:31:58.320
<v Speaker 4>some of them willingly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some of them happily,</v>

3485
02:31:58.680 --> 02:32:02.040
<v Speaker 4>who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's just what you're seeing is just</v>

3486
02:32:02.250 --> 02:32:06.390
<v Speaker 4>this is how this guy operates.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you saw the.</v>

3487
02:32:06.840 --> 02:32:11.840
<v Speaker 4>Harvey Levin is his name who released </v>
<v Speaker 4>all the various aspects of the contract </v>

3488
02:32:12.331 --> 02:32:16.800
<v Speaker 4>that he had where they had worked in </v>
<v Speaker 4>some glass?</v>

3489
02:32:16.940 --> 02:32:18.660
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he would get fined a certain amount,</v>

3490
02:32:18.930 --> 02:32:20.550
<v Speaker 4>like $100,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>for one,</v>

3491
02:32:20.820 --> 02:32:22.590
<v Speaker 4>$250,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>for this little,</v>

3492
02:32:22.591 --> 02:32:25.190
<v Speaker 4>like $500 for the naughty boy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fine.</v>

3493
02:32:25.350 --> 02:32:26.220
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

3494
02:32:26.280 --> 02:32:29.300
<v Speaker 4>like literally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but negotiated into the car.</v>

3495
02:32:29.370 --> 02:32:30.390
<v Speaker 4>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here it is.</v>

3496
02:32:31.120 --> 02:32:32.530
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3497
02:32:32.570 --> 02:32:35.880
<v Speaker 4>according to the contract of Weinstein </v>
<v Speaker 4>treated someone in properly in violation</v>

3498
02:32:35.881 --> 02:32:38.190
<v Speaker 4>of the company's Code of conduct,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which obviously means rape.</v>

3499
02:32:38.520 --> 02:32:41.670
<v Speaker 4>He must reimburse the Weinstein Company </v>
<v Speaker 4>for settlements or judgments.</v>

3500
02:32:41.671 --> 02:32:46.671
<v Speaker 4>Additionally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you will pay the company liquidated </v>

3501
02:32:46.671 --> 02:32:47.400
<v Speaker 4>damages of $250,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>for the first such instance,</v>

3502
02:32:47.401 --> 02:32:50.010
<v Speaker 4>$500,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>for the second 7:50</v>

3503
02:32:50.011 --> 02:32:53.280
<v Speaker 4>for the third and a million dollars for </v>
<v Speaker 4>each additional instance.</v>

3504
02:32:53.300 --> 02:32:54.630
<v Speaker 4>Subcontract is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

3505
02:32:54.631 --> 02:32:57.990
<v Speaker 4>you're going to get raped.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We know we know you're a piece of shit,</v>

3506
02:32:58.170 --> 02:33:00.850
<v Speaker 4>so we want to protect ourselves from </v>
<v Speaker 4>your piece of shit.</v>

3507
02:33:00.860 --> 02:33:04.680
<v Speaker 4>Place it is 100 percent known what the </v>
<v Speaker 4>contract says,</v>

3508
02:33:04.681 --> 02:33:08.550
<v Speaker 4>as long as Weinstein pays,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it constitutes a cure for the misconduct</v>

3509
02:33:08.551 --> 02:33:11.430
<v Speaker 4>and no further action can be taken.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Translation.</v>

3510
02:33:11.580 --> 02:33:16.170
<v Speaker 4>Weinstein could be sued over and over </v>
<v Speaker 4>and as long as you wrote a check,</v>

3511
02:33:16.171 --> 02:33:17.670
<v Speaker 4>he keeps his job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3512
02:33:17.910 --> 02:33:20.490
<v Speaker 4>which is fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just like they made a deal with the</v>

3513
02:33:20.491 --> 02:33:22.110
<v Speaker 4>devil.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They knew what they were doing,</v>

3514
02:33:22.140 --> 02:33:25.380
<v Speaker 4>but he just had a pile of like rape </v>
<v Speaker 4>checks and can just dole them out.</v>

3515
02:33:25.381 --> 02:33:30.381
<v Speaker 4>It's just amazing that this went on for </v>
<v Speaker 4>so long and that they literally had </v>

3516
02:33:30.601 --> 02:33:33.520
<v Speaker 4>negotiated this into a contract.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3517
02:33:33.550 --> 02:33:38.040
<v Speaker 4>I mean that is fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it takes that to change the culture.</v>

3518
02:33:38.190 --> 02:33:41.490
<v Speaker 4>It takes the cartoonish level.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

3519
02:33:41.550 --> 02:33:46.550
<v Speaker 4>It takes that to change the culture and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then all the people that are terrified </v>

3520
02:33:46.550 --> 02:33:50.001
<v Speaker 4>of being outed like him now will </v>
<v Speaker 4>recognize the consequences of those </v>

3521
02:33:50.001 --> 02:33:52.320
<v Speaker 4>actions and hopefully they're gonna </v>
<v Speaker 4>change their ways.</v>

3522
02:33:53.250 --> 02:33:54.990
<v Speaker 4>That's what we're hoping.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3523
02:33:55.050 --> 02:33:55.590
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3524
02:33:55.591 --> 02:33:56.300

<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

3525

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3528
02:34:03.150 --> 02:34:07.320
<v Speaker 4>And how do you know until you do it lies</v>
<v Speaker 4>the problem.</v>

3529
02:34:07.980 --> 02:34:09.930
<v Speaker 4>I was reading some fucking article,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
