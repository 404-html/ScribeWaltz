00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:04.800
<v Speaker 1>Four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

2
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.300
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

3
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.520
<v Speaker 1>And we're live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's up bro?</v>

4
00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:14.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing okay now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ten seconds ago around the area where I </v>

5
00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.650
<v Speaker 1>wanted it to be that way it's more </v>
<v Speaker 1>natural sometimes,</v>

6
00:00:18.651 --> 00:00:21.470
<v Speaker 1>like some of the best stuff gets said </v>
<v Speaker 1>off Mike.</v>

7
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.400
<v Speaker 1>So we figured now how to do it where </v>
<v Speaker 1>people get in and as soon as,</v>

8
00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.530
<v Speaker 1>pretty much as soon as we sit down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we started talking.</v>

9
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.120
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no complaints.</v>

10
00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.560
<v Speaker 1>So you contacted us after the Leah </v>
<v Speaker 1>Remini interview,</v>

11
00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.760
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you wanted to get on and you have </v>

12
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.901
<v Speaker 1>this book that you wrote called ruthless</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the correct pronunciation.</v>

13
00:00:41.301 --> 00:00:42.410
<v Speaker 1>Is Cabbage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>miscavige,</v>

14
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.940
<v Speaker 1>miscavige,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ms Dot Kavin.</v>

15
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.630
<v Speaker 1>The actual name of the book is rootless </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientology.</v>

16
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.740
<v Speaker 1>My son David miscavige in me right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me,</v>

17
00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.260
<v Speaker 1>let me just say this before we get </v>
<v Speaker 1>started,</v>

18
00:00:53.261 --> 00:00:58.261
<v Speaker 1>because scientology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the first time I've ever been </v>

19
00:00:58.261 --> 00:00:58.690
<v Speaker 1>contacted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They sent a,</v>

20
00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:03.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an email to my publicist and they have a</v>

21
00:01:03.791 --> 00:01:08.791
<v Speaker 1>rebuttal to what you wrote and their </v>
<v Speaker 1>rebuttal is that a website?</v>

22
00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.550
<v Speaker 1>Ron miscavige book dot Com.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they want people to know about their</v>

23
00:01:17.261 --> 00:01:20.230
<v Speaker 1>website,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is scientology.org.</v>

24
00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.470
<v Speaker 1>And they have a statement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is their statement,</v>

25
00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.930
<v Speaker 1>Ron miscavige is seeking to make money </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the name of his famous son,</v>

26
00:01:28.931 --> 00:01:31.360
<v Speaker 1>David miscavige.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

27
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.510
<v Speaker 1>David miscavige is taken care of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>father throughout his life,</v>

28
00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.070
<v Speaker 1>both financially and by helping him and </v>
<v Speaker 1>even the most dire circumstances.</v>

29
00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.430
<v Speaker 1>Ron miscavige was nowhere around when </v>
<v Speaker 1>David miscavige ascended to the </v>

30
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.751
<v Speaker 1>leadership of the Church of scientology </v>
<v Speaker 1>mentioned by and working directly with </v>

31
00:01:49.391 --> 00:01:54.391
<v Speaker 1>the religions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>founder l dot Ron Hubbard and entrusted </v>

32
00:01:54.391 --> 00:01:57.781
<v Speaker 1>by him with the future of the church and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he father exploiting his son in this </v>

33
00:01:58.481 --> 00:02:03.481
<v Speaker 1>manner is a sad exercise of betrayal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr David miscavige has far reaching </v>

34
00:02:04.331 --> 00:02:08.830
<v Speaker 1>vision and unrelenting dedication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has brought the Church of Scientology to</v>

35
00:02:08.831 --> 00:02:12.250
<v Speaker 1>where it is today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guaranteeing it's future for generations</v>

36
00:02:12.251 --> 00:02:17.251
<v Speaker 1>to come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scientologists worldwide love and </v>

37
00:02:17.251 --> 00:02:20.941
<v Speaker 1>respect Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ms Dot for his tireless work on behalf </v>

38
00:02:20.941 --> 00:02:20.941
<v Speaker 1>of their religion.</v>

39
00:02:20.941 --> 00:02:25.600
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's their statement that they wanted </v>

40
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.340
<v Speaker 1>to say and I feel like it's only fair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

41
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.400
<v Speaker 1>we had Leah Remini on and we have you on</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've had a Louis Theroux on and look</v>

42
00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.980
<v Speaker 1>at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I don't know the story,</v>

43
00:02:35.981 --> 00:02:40.810
<v Speaker 1>but anytime a father is so disconnected </v>
<v Speaker 1>from his son,</v>

44
00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.440
<v Speaker 1>they have to write a book about him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a sad time.</v>

45
00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.930
<v Speaker 1>Do you feel like that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

46
00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.470
<v Speaker 1>You don't feel sad at all?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel that.</v>

47
00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.050
<v Speaker 1>I just woke up one day and said I'd like</v>
<v Speaker 1>to write a book about scientology and if</v>

48
00:02:56.051 --> 00:02:58.300
<v Speaker 1>I can give you a short encapsulated </v>
<v Speaker 1>statement,</v>

49
00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.740
<v Speaker 1>I think we could a nice</v>

50
00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.100
<v Speaker 2>groundwork for the whole interview.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You mind if I do that?</v>

51
00:03:03.101 --> 00:03:03.800
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

52
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.980
<v Speaker 2>I was a scientologist for 42 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Were you raised in it?</v>

53
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.950
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got my family in in 1970,</v>

54
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.960
<v Speaker 2>but I was in the church for 42 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The last 26 and a half years.</v>

55
00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.990
<v Speaker 2>I worked at the international base in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hemet,</v>

56
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:25.020
<v Speaker 2>California.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I escaped from that base on March 25th,</v>

57
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.160
<v Speaker 2>2012.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You escaped?</v>

58
00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.480
<v Speaker 2>Escaped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

59
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.790
<v Speaker 2>I had the plan that escape for six </v>
<v Speaker 2>months.</v>

60
00:03:30.791 --> 00:03:35.791
<v Speaker 2>We can go into this in more detail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just let me give you this short </v>

61
00:03:35.791 --> 00:03:36.430
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>About a year and a half later,</v>

62
00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.060
<v Speaker 2>there was a private and guest </v>
<v Speaker 2>investigator caught by the name of </v>

63
00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.121
<v Speaker 2>Dwayne Powell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was around the corner from my house </v>

64
00:03:45.121 --> 00:03:50.070
<v Speaker 2>looking at a house to buy so he could </v>
<v Speaker 2>spy on me from that house and they just </v>

65
00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:54.660
<v Speaker 2>know shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a lady in the neighborhood som and </v>

66
00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:55.720
<v Speaker 2>she thought he was a drug dealer or up </v>
<v Speaker 2>to no good.</v>

67
00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.720
<v Speaker 2>So she called the West Allis police and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Nick Pike came out and confronted the </v>

68
00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.250
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He gave nicky some shit and nick said,</v>

69
00:04:03.251 --> 00:04:04.750
<v Speaker 2>hey listen man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're under arrest.</v>

70
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:10.110
<v Speaker 2>Do you mind if I look in your car?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Nick went to the van and opened it </v>

71
00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.360
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the trunk,</v>

72
00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.900
<v Speaker 2>there were five license plates from five</v>
<v Speaker 2>different states.</v>

73
00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.020
<v Speaker 2>There were two handguns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a stun gun,</v>

74
00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.620
<v Speaker 2>two rifles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One fitted up with a silencer in 2000 </v>

75
00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.030
<v Speaker 2>rounds of ammunition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they arrested the guy,</v>

76
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.360
<v Speaker 2>they took him in for interrogation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then his son came looking for him </v>

77
00:04:30.671 --> 00:04:32.680
<v Speaker 2>because his son was a partner in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>business.</v>

78
00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.310
<v Speaker 2>The father's name was Dwayne Powell and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the sun was Daniel Powell.</v>

79
00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.610
<v Speaker 2>Daniel came looking for his father.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>

80
00:04:39.611 --> 00:04:42.550
<v Speaker 2>if you want to hear these interviews,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're on Tony Ortega's website,</v>

81
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.880
<v Speaker 2>Tony Ortega to underground bunker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can hear what I'm telling you.</v>

82
00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:47.960
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Daniel is telling me,</v>

83
00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:49.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how they operated.</v>

84
00:04:49.901 --> 00:04:54.901
<v Speaker 2>They were getting paid $10,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>a week to follow me and report on my </v>

85
00:04:54.901 --> 00:04:56.380
<v Speaker 2>doings from 8:00</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the morning until 8:00</v>

86
00:04:56.381 --> 00:04:58.810
<v Speaker 2>every night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>An incident happened</v>

87
00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:00.380
<v Speaker 1>in Janesville,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wisconsin.</v>

88
00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:07.030
<v Speaker 1>What do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what could you possibly do that </v>

89
00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:07.580
<v Speaker 1>would be worth studying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it just a freak you out?</v>

90
00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.100
<v Speaker 1>Like that's what I don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you follow like if I fall,</v>

91
00:05:10.101 --> 00:05:11.100
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

92
00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:16.270
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm going to get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get Jamie looking at the </v>

93
00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.270
<v Speaker 1>Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie watching basketball.</v>

94
00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.350
<v Speaker 1>Maybe Jamie goes to the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe Jamie goes for a run.</v>

95
00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:23.580
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie goes on tinder and does a little </v>

96
00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.580
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right swiping right.</v>

97
00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.720
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could get out of watching them.</v>

98
00:05:26.721 --> 00:05:28.880
<v Speaker 1>It's not like you're out there burying </v>
<v Speaker 1>bodies.</v>

99
00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:30.360
<v Speaker 1>No kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

100
00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.150
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me continue because it just goes on</v>

101
00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:34.350
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're interrogating them.</v>

102
00:05:34.351 --> 00:05:36.150
<v Speaker 2>That's Nick Pie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there was an alcohol,</v>

103
00:05:36.151 --> 00:05:38.490
<v Speaker 2>tobacco and Firearms Agent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rick Warren Hankins,</v>

104
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.970
<v Speaker 2>and because they were concerned about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that sort of theory that hey,</v>

105
00:05:41.971 --> 00:05:45.690
<v Speaker 2>maybe they're out to hit me because I am</v>
<v Speaker 2>the father of the chairman of the board.</v>

106
00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.550
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then Daniel,</v>

107
00:05:47.551 --> 00:05:49.600
<v Speaker 2>the son is being interrogated and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>said they,</v>

108
00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.530
<v Speaker 2>they followed me to a town called </v>
<v Speaker 2>Janesville,</v>

109
00:05:52.531 --> 00:05:55.970
<v Speaker 2>Wisconsin where I went shopping and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>these grocery stores dark.</v>

110
00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:57.980
<v Speaker 1>This is very</v>

111
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.050
<v Speaker 2>detailed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you this is what happened.</v>

112
00:06:00.051 --> 00:06:03.170
<v Speaker 2>So I come out and I had bags of grocery </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was the summertime.</v>

113
00:06:03.171 --> 00:06:08.171
<v Speaker 2>So I had a pocket tee shirt on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bent over to put the groceries in the </v>

114
00:06:08.171 --> 00:06:11.561
<v Speaker 2>car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I taught myself and was going to fall </v>

115
00:06:11.561 --> 00:06:11.561
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I grabbed my left chest.</v>

116
00:06:11.561 --> 00:06:15.580
<v Speaker 2>They're looking at me in the van,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which they had been following me and </v>

117
00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.830
<v Speaker 2>they saw me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The father called his contact and said,</v>

118
00:06:18.831 --> 00:06:23.831
<v Speaker 2>listen to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks like the target is having a </v>

119
00:06:23.831 --> 00:06:23.831
<v Speaker 2>heart attack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What should we do?</v>

120
00:06:23.831 --> 00:06:23.831
<v Speaker 2>They refer to me as the target,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

121
00:06:23.831 --> 00:06:24.580
<v Speaker 2>Oh Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no shit.</v>

122
00:06:24.581 --> 00:06:27.260
<v Speaker 2>And they get a silencer and fucking 2000</v>
<v Speaker 2>rounds of Ammo.</v>

123
00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.280
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

124
00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:30.530
<v Speaker 2>So they called the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Greg said,</v>

125
00:06:30.531 --> 00:06:32.660
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me call you back.</v>

126
00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.270
<v Speaker 2>A couple minutes later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a guy come on the phone,</v>

127
00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.870
<v Speaker 2>identified himself as David miscavige </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he said to them,</v>

128
00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:41.150
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's his time to die,</v>

129
00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:43.820
<v Speaker 2>let him die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't do anything.</v>

130
00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:44.780
<v Speaker 2>Don't intervene.</v>

131
00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:48.690
<v Speaker 1>That's my son [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>

132
00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:51.310
<v Speaker 1>well it didn't just happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

133
00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:52.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't,</v>

134
00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:53.130
<v Speaker 1>you didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want,</v>

135
00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:55.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to interrupt your story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You feel like it goes on,</v>

136
00:06:55.660 --> 00:07:00.660
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your relationship with your son didn't </v>

137
00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:01.450
<v Speaker 1>just start there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it had to.</v>

138
00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:03.370
<v Speaker 1>It had it go sour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows shit,</v>

139
00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:04.510
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

140
00:07:04.511 --> 00:07:07.900
<v Speaker 1>my relationship with David when he was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>kid was incredible.</v>

141
00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got along great.</v>

142
00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:10.150
<v Speaker 1>He was</v>

143
00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:11.600
<v Speaker 2>a snappy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little kid.</v>

144
00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:14.190
<v Speaker 2>He was just very bright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great sense of humor.</v>

145
00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.350
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

146
00:07:16.351 --> 00:07:19.080
<v Speaker 2>I enjoyed his company,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as he grew older,</v>

147
00:07:19.081 --> 00:07:21.390
<v Speaker 2>as you got into scientology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I got him in,</v>

148
00:07:21.391 --> 00:07:22.920
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can get into that.</v>

149
00:07:22.921 --> 00:07:27.921
<v Speaker 2>How I got him in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He then started acquiring power and I </v>

150
00:07:27.921 --> 00:07:31.800
<v Speaker 2>think he went from Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jekyll and Mr Hyde as an example,</v>

151
00:07:31.801 --> 00:07:35.280
<v Speaker 2>when I worked on staff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he never referred to me as dad.</v>

152
00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:39.210
<v Speaker 2>He called me run the base that I lived </v>
<v Speaker 2>on in Hamot.</v>

153
00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:43.650
<v Speaker 2>It got to the point where if you wanted </v>
<v Speaker 2>to send a letter to somebody,</v>

154
00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:46.770
<v Speaker 2>you had to write the letter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put it in an unsealed envelope,</v>

155
00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:51.860
<v Speaker 2>two security guards would read it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see if there anything bad in there that </v>

156
00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:53.880
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't be saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>send it back and I would correct it when</v>

157
00:07:53.881 --> 00:07:58.881
<v Speaker 2>it was okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they sealed the envelope and send </v>

158
00:07:58.881 --> 00:07:58.881
<v Speaker 2>it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I wanted them to call somebody on the</v>

159
00:07:58.881 --> 00:08:00.380
<v Speaker 2>telephone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to have somebody to listen</v>

160
00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:05.560
<v Speaker 1>on the other extension and this is by </v>
<v Speaker 1>his orders versus just how scientology </v>

161
00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:08.320
<v Speaker 1>notch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not how scientology works it.</v>

162
00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:12.890
<v Speaker 1>He is the undisputed dictator of </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientology,</v>

163
00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:18.670
<v Speaker 1>so this is is Antara doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the way he wanted it to run </v>

164
00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:22.190
<v Speaker 1>scientology in 1970 when I got in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which totally different than what was it</v>

165
00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.650
<v Speaker 1>then it was like for a free spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

166
00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:27.890
<v Speaker 1>just very lost a fair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you did courses.</v>

167
00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:32.980
<v Speaker 1>You could come in and do things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>would actually improve your ability to </v>

168
00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:35.300
<v Speaker 1>communicate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have better interpersonal relations.</v>

169
00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:40.960
<v Speaker 1>I bought the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bought dianetics and 1994 because I </v>

170
00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:44.970
<v Speaker 1>moved to California and I was really </v>
<v Speaker 1>into self help books and stuff like </v>

171
00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:44.970
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I saw one of those,</v>

172
00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:46.760
<v Speaker 1>a late night infomercial ads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

173
00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:47.860
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

174
00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:48.810
<v Speaker 1>this looks like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

175
00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:50.210
<v Speaker 1>the reactive mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

176
00:08:50.211 --> 00:08:53.780
<v Speaker 1>I want to have control of the reactive </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind and uh,</v>

177
00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:54.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got into it,</v>

178
00:08:54.681 --> 00:08:56.100
<v Speaker 1>I read a little bed and I was like,</v>

179
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:58.650
<v Speaker 2>hm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably some good principles in here,</v>

180
00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:03.680
<v Speaker 2>some decent ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I always associated scientologists </v>

181
00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:06.300
<v Speaker 2>with being positive people that got a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of things done.</v>

182
00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:11.460
<v Speaker 2>That's a very true statement and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>telling you at what they call the bottom</v>

183
00:09:11.461 --> 00:09:16.020
<v Speaker 2>of the bridge because the entire </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientology experience would be a bridge</v>

184
00:09:16.021 --> 00:09:18.990
<v Speaker 2>to total freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You went to reading at a certain point,</v>

185
00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:21.570
<v Speaker 2>you're given basic things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basic courses,</v>

186
00:09:21.571 --> 00:09:23.610
<v Speaker 2>basic communication skills that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>taught.</v>

187
00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:29.330
<v Speaker 2>And I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go out on the street after you do </v>

188
00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:29.330
<v Speaker 2>this stuff and you're more effective in </v>
<v Speaker 2>handling life.</v>

189
00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:32.330
<v Speaker 2>So the early stages of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you feel I need it.</v>

190
00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:37.490
<v Speaker 2>They're very effective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they were effective then they're </v>

191
00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:37.680
<v Speaker 2>effective today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you'll learn the proper communication</v>

192
00:09:37.681 --> 00:09:40.950
<v Speaker 2>formula that will improve your life </v>
<v Speaker 2>alone.</v>

193
00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:43.320
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just communicating correctly,</v>

194
00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.630
<v Speaker 2>knowing there's component,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's parts of it.</v>

195
00:09:45.631 --> 00:09:46.740
<v Speaker 2>It's not just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

196
00:09:46.741 --> 00:09:49.110
<v Speaker 2>you and the other guy says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you want?</v>

197
00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:51.720
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's literally get the other person's</v>

198
00:09:51.721 --> 00:09:56.721
<v Speaker 2>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Make sure you're giving them a </v>

199
00:09:56.721 --> 00:10:00.591
<v Speaker 2>communication that he can understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to talk that somebody </v>

200
00:10:00.591 --> 00:10:00.591
<v Speaker 2>in French if he's English,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

201
00:10:00.591 --> 00:10:03.570
<v Speaker 2>just all little details that you learn </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you drilled these.</v>

202
00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:06.000
<v Speaker 2>And then there's other things about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

203
00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:10.580
<v Speaker 2>interpersonal relationships with your </v>
<v Speaker 2>wife or a group you'll learn to.</v>

204
00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:15.590
<v Speaker 2>You're better off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're essentially telling you how </v>

205
00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:15.750
<v Speaker 2>to be a better person in the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

206
00:10:15.751 --> 00:10:20.751
<v Speaker 2>And part of that you would then also </v>
<v Speaker 2>become more positive just simply by </v>

207
00:10:20.751 --> 00:10:21.390
<v Speaker 2>having this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these skills.</v>

208
00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:23.130
<v Speaker 2>Well this sounds good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is good.</v>

209
00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:25.050
<v Speaker 2>Where does it go bad?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

210
00:10:25.051 --> 00:10:27.330
<v Speaker 2>here's where it goes bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

211
00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:34.370
<v Speaker 2>the further on you get in the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me back up a second.</v>

212
00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:40.040
<v Speaker 2>Let's say you learn the component parts </v>
<v Speaker 2>of communication and you say,</v>

213
00:10:41.041 --> 00:10:41.510
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

214
00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:42.980
<v Speaker 2>This is good shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

215
00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:48.500
<v Speaker 2>You agree to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the first step on taking you on </v>

216
00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:51.990
<v Speaker 2>this entire journey and then you may be </v>
<v Speaker 2>a learn how you can divide your business</v>

217
00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:57.240
<v Speaker 2>into seven parts so that you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>monitor various parts of it or your life</v>

218
00:10:57.241 --> 00:11:01.050
<v Speaker 2>in the seven parts so you could manage a</v>
<v Speaker 2>how you're doing income wise,</v>

219
00:11:01.051 --> 00:11:06.051
<v Speaker 2>how education is your public relations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are all things you can easily </v>

220
00:11:06.051 --> 00:11:10.431
<v Speaker 2>agree to show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not a little later on there's a data or </v>

221
00:11:10.431 --> 00:11:11.850
<v Speaker 2>a fact introduced that doesn't quite </v>
<v Speaker 2>make sense to you,</v>

222
00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:15.290
<v Speaker 2>but you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

223
00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:17.010
<v Speaker 2>Everything they told me it was good so </v>
<v Speaker 2>far.</v>

224
00:11:17.011 --> 00:11:19.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to accept this now you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the road.</v>

225
00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:20.100
<v Speaker 2>Give me an example.</v>

226
00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:25.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it like Xenu type shit?</v>

227
00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:26.730
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

228
00:11:26.731 --> 00:11:29.190
<v Speaker 2>That would be a big example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the way down the line,</v>

229
00:11:29.191 --> 00:11:30.480
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's way down the line,</v>

230
00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:35.510
<v Speaker 2>but there's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some early wackiness that gives </v>

231
00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:36.360
<v Speaker 2>you an indication that things might to </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

232
00:11:36.361 --> 00:11:37.340
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're right.</v>

233
00:11:37.341 --> 00:11:42.341
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the one where you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>agreed to so many things so far and all </v>

234
00:11:42.341 --> 00:11:45.870
<v Speaker 2>of the auditing you've gotten that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's helped you when it comes to that.</v>

235
00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:48.480
<v Speaker 2>As an example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I got on that level,</v>

236
00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:50.640
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

237
00:11:50.641 --> 00:11:52.740
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's $150.</v>

238
00:11:52.741 --> 00:11:57.741
<v Speaker 2>Billion People on 76 nearby planets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they brought them here in spaceships</v>

239
00:11:58.550 --> 00:11:59.920
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck did to get everybody here.</v>

240
00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:05.220
<v Speaker 2>I looked at it from a physical point of </v>
<v Speaker 2>view from a point of view of logistics.</v>

241
00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:07.960
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot of spaceships,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I thought,</v>

242
00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:09.820
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll accept it.</v>

243
00:12:09.821 --> 00:12:14.821
<v Speaker 2>I'll just do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One hundred and 50 billion people per </v>

244
00:12:14.821 --> 00:12:14.821
<v Speaker 2>planet.</v>

245
00:12:14.821 --> 00:12:17.410
<v Speaker 2>That was the problem was overpopulation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but do you see what I'm saying?</v>

246
00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:20.140
<v Speaker 2>So at that point you've agreed to so </v>
<v Speaker 2>many things that were.</v>

247
00:12:20.141 --> 00:12:20.830
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

248
00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:23.170
<v Speaker 2>I understand it comes up to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to say,</v>

249
00:12:23.171 --> 00:12:24.690
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're out of your goddamn mind.</v>

250
00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:27.790
<v Speaker 2>It's helping you give you a direction in</v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

251
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.000
<v Speaker 2>It's making you more positive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's giving you better communication </v>

252
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.241
<v Speaker 2>skills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have a structure that you could </v>

253
00:12:36.241 --> 00:12:36.241
<v Speaker 2>fall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you communicate with people,</v>

254
00:12:36.241 --> 00:12:38.320
<v Speaker 2>it makes you more presentable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So everything's good in the beginning.</v>

255
00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:41.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why doesn't somebody just take that part</v>

256
00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:43.810
<v Speaker 2>and just like get rid of the rest?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>

257
00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.960
<v Speaker 2>I tell in my book what we're looking at </v>
<v Speaker 2>right here,</v>

258
00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:49.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rootless scientology,</v>

259
00:12:49.811 --> 00:12:53.290
<v Speaker 2>my son David miscavige and me I say at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the very end if they would,</v>

260
00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:56.320
<v Speaker 2>if they were to just to stick to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>beginning things,</v>

261
00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:02.340
<v Speaker 2>number one and number two have a general</v>
<v Speaker 2>amnesty where they forgive everybody who</v>

262
00:13:02.411 --> 00:13:05.320
<v Speaker 2>they think has tried to determine the </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit's gonna hit the fan,</v>

263
00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:10.620
<v Speaker 2>but maybe at the end of it you'd get </v>
<v Speaker 2>some people back and knock off the </v>

264
00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:10.620
<v Speaker 2>disconnection policy.</v>

265
00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:15.840
<v Speaker 2>I think if they did that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could be one of the best self help </v>

266
00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:18.781
<v Speaker 2>groups ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But once you get up into those upper </v>

267
00:13:18.781 --> 00:13:21.610
<v Speaker 2>levels where they tell you you're going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to become superhuman as an example,</v>

268
00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:24.490
<v Speaker 2>you will be able to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a spiritual being,</v>

269
00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:28.420
<v Speaker 2>leave your body and go some other place </v>
<v Speaker 2>as an example.</v>

270
00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:31.460
<v Speaker 2>And read a newspaper in Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

271
00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:34.030
<v Speaker 2>That it's not like remote viewing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

272
00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:35.260
<v Speaker 2>And I'm going to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

273
00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:38.470
<v Speaker 2>I was involved for 42 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He never went to Germany,</v>

274
00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:41.320
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never learned about in Portugal,</v>

275
00:13:41.321 --> 00:13:42.410
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a fucking,</v>

276
00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:47.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seriously though I never met one person </v>

277
00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:49.270
<v Speaker 2>that has ever achieved that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nor did I achieve it.</v>

278
00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:52.570
<v Speaker 2>But you don't talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand.</v>

279
00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:56.320
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that say you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about your case to somebody else,</v>

280
00:13:56.740 --> 00:14:00.060
<v Speaker 2>so that's compartmentalized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So everybody who's done this,</v>

281
00:14:00.061 --> 00:14:03.130
<v Speaker 2>his thinking and I never got it when </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe I'm the only one,</v>

282
00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:03.710
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

283
00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:06.640
<v Speaker 2>So like maybe if I just keep working at </v>
<v Speaker 2>this one day,</v>

284
00:14:06.641 --> 00:14:11.641
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna pop through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly when you go for the next </v>

285
00:14:11.641 --> 00:14:14.981
<v Speaker 2>slide today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>explain how you're going to do that as </v>

286
00:14:14.981 --> 00:14:15.400
<v Speaker 2>through meditation techniques.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it through some sort of hypnosis?</v>

287
00:14:15.401 --> 00:14:20.401
<v Speaker 2>Like how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how are they supposed to go to Germany </v>

288
00:14:20.401 --> 00:14:22.020
<v Speaker 2>and read newspaper?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well out of their body,</v>

289
00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:23.900
<v Speaker 2>there's drills that you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you,</v>

290
00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:28.030
<v Speaker 2>they have you do like in the earlier </v>
<v Speaker 2>what they call ot levels,</v>

291
00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:32.150
<v Speaker 2>operating Phaeton Phaeton his award they</v>
<v Speaker 2>use for spiritual being,</v>

292
00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:38.460
<v Speaker 2>and one of the drills that you would do </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be spot three objects outside of </v>

293
00:14:38.921 --> 00:14:42.820
<v Speaker 2>your body spot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three objects inside your body spot,</v>

294
00:14:42.821 --> 00:14:45.160
<v Speaker 2>three objects out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>judge your body spot,</v>

295
00:14:45.161 --> 00:14:50.161
<v Speaker 2>three objects inside your body on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>repetitive basis and that's supposed to </v>

296
00:14:50.161 --> 00:14:51.800
<v Speaker 2>let you out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So is that an example?</v>

297
00:14:51.801 --> 00:14:55.880
<v Speaker 2>So it's like a meditation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I guess it would be a spot.</v>

298
00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.730
<v Speaker 2>Are you saying like envision?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

299
00:14:58.731 --> 00:15:02.330
<v Speaker 2>I mean in the physical universe you </v>
<v Speaker 2>spots like that Clark,</v>

300
00:15:02.331 --> 00:15:07.331
<v Speaker 2>this book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then inside your body just think </v>

301
00:15:07.331 --> 00:15:09.140
<v Speaker 2>about three blocks from and lungs and </v>
<v Speaker 2>ribs.</v>

302
00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:09.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

303
00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:15.070
<v Speaker 2>But then the other thing is like when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you get to ot three and you're talking </v>

304
00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:15.070
<v Speaker 2>about body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Satan's.</v>

305
00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:19.550
<v Speaker 2>These are the alien beings that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>brought here,</v>

306
00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:25.120
<v Speaker 2>put on a nearby volcano,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a hydrogen bomb would shut off and they </v>

307
00:15:25.521 --> 00:15:28.020
<v Speaker 2>sent it for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grabbed these people liquid.</v>

308
00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:30.510
<v Speaker 2>You can look on the Internet and find </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

309
00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:35.760
<v Speaker 2>I've read it all unfortunately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what happens then is they are all </v>

310
00:15:36.201 --> 00:15:39.620
<v Speaker 2>latched to your body like a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fleas damage and they're affecting your,</v>

311
00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:44.830
<v Speaker 2>your thinking and your personality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the ID on these upper levels is to </v>

312
00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:48.560
<v Speaker 2>get rid of all of them and achieved </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

313
00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:54.040
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's ever done it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if there were three people who did </v>

314
00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:54.040
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd say,</v>

315
00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:54.040
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

316
00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:54.620
<v Speaker 2>maybe it can be right.</v>

317
00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:55.720
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a fucking one.</v>

318
00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:57.170
<v Speaker 2>Excuse my French buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

319
00:15:57.171 --> 00:15:58.280
<v Speaker 2>you can swear away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

322
00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:05.840
<v Speaker 2>so how did you go from that to this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you go from the Marine Corps,</v>

323
00:16:05.841 --> 00:16:08.150
<v Speaker 2>which is about as real as it gets to </v>
<v Speaker 2>this?</v>

<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:12.940
<v Speaker 2>So what scheme pyramid scheme right here</v>
<v Speaker 2>made.</v>

348
00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:13.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

349
00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:16.520
<v Speaker 2>So I went to an opportunity meeting and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>

350
00:17:16.521 --> 00:17:17.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe I could do this.</v>

351
00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:19.850
<v Speaker 2>So I bought in and I started doing it in</v>
<v Speaker 2>one day.</v>

352
00:17:19.851 --> 00:17:24.410
<v Speaker 2>We're at an opportunity meeting that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>were running and there's a girl standing</v>

353
00:17:24.411 --> 00:17:26.960
<v Speaker 2>next to me talking to a guy over here </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm talking to this guy.</v>

354
00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:30.020
<v Speaker 2>This guy says I'm a scientologist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just hang on a second.</v>

355
00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:35.260
<v Speaker 2>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I pinned him down for about a half an </v>

356
00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:35.390
<v Speaker 2>hour and for whatever reason the name </v>
<v Speaker 2>rang a bell.</v>

357
00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:42.130
<v Speaker 2>So he told me that I could go visit </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody who was a scientologist and </v>

358
00:17:42.651 --> 00:17:46.490
<v Speaker 2>they discuss it one day a week guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the name of Frank Ogle in Woodbury,</v>

359
00:17:46.491 --> 00:17:48.110
<v Speaker 2>New Jersey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

360
00:17:48.111 --> 00:17:49.170
<v Speaker 2>you're from North Jersey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't you?</v>

361
00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:50.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Newark,</v>

362
00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:51.030
<v Speaker 2>Newark,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

363
00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:57.020
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I go to this place and he would have </v>

364
00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:59.190
<v Speaker 2>little classes where he talk about </v>
<v Speaker 2>communication and various things.</v>

365
00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:02.880
<v Speaker 2>I went there for about four days in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>month,</v>

366
00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:05.640
<v Speaker 2>like for a month,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one day a week,</v>

367
00:18:05.641 --> 00:18:06.360
<v Speaker 2>and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

368
00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:07.020
<v Speaker 2>I got it now.</v>

369
00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:10.740
<v Speaker 2>Motor factor here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>David,</v>

370
00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:15.930
<v Speaker 2>when he was born,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was cursed with an asthma condition.</v>

371
00:18:15.931 --> 00:18:20.931
<v Speaker 2>That was the bane of his existence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean as a little baby sometimes he </v>

372
00:18:22.021 --> 00:18:24.630
<v Speaker 2>turned blue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He couldn't read out and it was horrible</v>

373
00:18:24.631 --> 00:18:29.631
<v Speaker 2>to watch this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was the one who took care of that </v>

374
00:18:29.631 --> 00:18:30.810
<v Speaker 2>just about totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As matter of fact,</v>

375
00:18:30.811 --> 00:18:35.811
<v Speaker 2>when he would have these attacks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would take him to a pediatrician in </v>

376
00:18:35.811 --> 00:18:36.510
<v Speaker 2>Burlington,</v>
<v Speaker 2>New Jersey called Dr Ziegler.</v>

377
00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:41.100
<v Speaker 2>He'd give them a shot of adrenaline and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew that given a little kid a shot of</v>

378
00:18:41.101 --> 00:18:43.170
<v Speaker 2>adrenaline was not great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

379
00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:45.310
<v Speaker 2>So I would try all kinds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't,</v>

380
00:18:45.370 --> 00:18:48.600
<v Speaker 2>they didn't have inhalers back then they</v>
<v Speaker 2>had inhalers,</v>

381
00:18:48.601 --> 00:18:53.460
<v Speaker 2>but that's handling the symptom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not the cause.</v>

382
00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:57.660
<v Speaker 2>And I didn't know what to do to handle </v>
<v Speaker 2>the cause I to the new shit.</v>

383
00:18:57.661 --> 00:19:01.440
<v Speaker 2>Like one winter he's just in a full </v>
<v Speaker 2>blown attack,</v>

384
00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:02.190
<v Speaker 2>turning blue.</v>

385
00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:04.140
<v Speaker 2>It's cold jersey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

386
00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:05.730
<v Speaker 2>gold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jersey winter.</v>

387
00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:08.730
<v Speaker 2>I took them upstairs to the bathroom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>took off his clothes,</v>

388
00:19:08.731 --> 00:19:10.340
<v Speaker 2>stuck off mine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stood in the shower,</v>

389
00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:12.540
<v Speaker 2>said David,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not punishing man.</v>

390
00:19:12.541 --> 00:19:14.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had the warm water on it,</v>

391
00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:19.650
<v Speaker 2>turned it off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That water is that coming out of there </v>

392
00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:21.210
<v Speaker 2>about 34 degrees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He started breathing,</v>

393
00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:26.750
<v Speaker 2>kicked it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wiped them down with a Turkish towel </v>

394
00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:26.750
<v Speaker 2>that handled it for the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to do shit like that.</v>

395
00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:31.071
<v Speaker 2>Anything to handle them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now I found out about scientology </v>

396
00:19:31.071 --> 00:19:34.050
<v Speaker 2>from this Nelson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sandy and Frank Ogle was the guy.</v>

397
00:19:34.051 --> 00:19:38.280
<v Speaker 2>I took David Down one day and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there anything you can do for David?</v>

398
00:19:38.281 --> 00:19:43.281
<v Speaker 2>Would Scientology Auditing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is basically another word for </v>

399
00:19:43.281 --> 00:19:45.801
<v Speaker 2>counseling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He took David in and 45 minutes later </v>

400
00:19:45.801 --> 00:19:47.400
<v Speaker 2>dave comes out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isaiah was a gun and he says,</v>

401
00:19:47.401 --> 00:19:48.330
<v Speaker 2>Dad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm handled,</v>

402
00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:52.230
<v Speaker 2>and he never had another severe attack </v>
<v Speaker 2>and his entire youth,</v>

403
00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:56.460
<v Speaker 2>he had some possible with communication,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with communication,</v>

404
00:19:56.461 --> 00:19:57.480
<v Speaker 2>you can stop asthma.</v>

405
00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:03.650
<v Speaker 2>You come to the point where you have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>realization maybe where it started or </v>

406
00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:06.400
<v Speaker 2>how you could be contributing to it or </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe where it starts kicking in old.</v>

407
00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:11.450
<v Speaker 2>Was He when you brought them in there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess this was using about nine years </v>

408
00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:11.450
<v Speaker 2>old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

409
00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:12.650
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like what?</v>

410
00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:15.870
<v Speaker 2>What tools did they use to help him kick</v>
<v Speaker 2>asthma?</v>

411
00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:20.220
<v Speaker 2>That communication,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that just communication like,</v>

412
00:20:20.221 --> 00:20:20.820
<v Speaker 2>hi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's,</v>

413
00:20:20.821 --> 00:20:21.690
<v Speaker 2>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on?</v>

414
00:20:21.691 --> 00:20:26.691
<v Speaker 2>He got asthma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What communication do you mean by </v>

415
00:20:26.691 --> 00:20:26.691
<v Speaker 2>communication?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

416
00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:30.060
<v Speaker 2>He did you use what's called the </v>
<v Speaker 2>creative processing,</v>

417
00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:35.240
<v Speaker 2>which is something that they used to use</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what it is is you figure out how you</v>

418
00:20:35.251 --> 00:20:40.251
<v Speaker 2>could be contributing to that and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you do a mental image picture of </v>

419
00:20:40.531 --> 00:20:45.531
<v Speaker 2>something that you think you're doing to</v>
<v Speaker 2>contribute to that and back and forth.</v>

420
00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:51.160
<v Speaker 2>It's a little for me to try to explain </v>
<v Speaker 2>it in a little session like this.</v>

421
00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:53.500
<v Speaker 2>It's a little hard because.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

422
00:20:53.501 --> 00:20:56.350
<v Speaker 2>it's a little hard to understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if it did work on him,</v>

423
00:20:56.500 --> 00:21:01.500
<v Speaker 2>so you're saying in some sense asthma </v>
<v Speaker 2>may be psychosomatic and maybe in your </v>

424
00:21:01.781 --> 00:21:04.810
<v Speaker 2>head for him it was to that degree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

425
00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:08.740
<v Speaker 2>I am saying never got asthma again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He never had a severe attack again.</v>

426
00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:12.670
<v Speaker 2>He had my minor attacks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was able to stop them with these.</v>

427
00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:16.580
<v Speaker 2>He used to get so bad that it would </v>
<v Speaker 2>debilitate them.</v>

428
00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:19.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was out of school for a week one time</v>

429
00:21:19.811 --> 00:21:21.640
<v Speaker 2>with an attack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is before we,</v>

430
00:21:21.641 --> 00:21:24.850
<v Speaker 2>I ever took him to see Frank Ogle and </v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

431
00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:32.730
<v Speaker 2>that impressed me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that this handle that for the </v>

432
00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:32.730
<v Speaker 2>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

433
00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:37.950
<v Speaker 2>so with that and some other things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I decided I'm going to get my whole </v>

434
00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:40.870
<v Speaker 2>family and scientology because it look </v>
<v Speaker 2>his whole life.</v>

435
00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:43.810
<v Speaker 2>That was a problem for me to handle and </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

436
00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:48.960
<v Speaker 2>at least at that moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got into the point where he was like in </v>

437
00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:49.390
<v Speaker 2>charge of it.</v>

438
00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:51.530
<v Speaker 2>It didn't happen to them again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That severe.</v>

439
00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:54.350
<v Speaker 2>Does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make sense.</v>

440
00:21:54.351 --> 00:21:59.351
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's what persuaded you to begin </v>

441
00:21:59.351 --> 00:21:59.950
<v Speaker 2>quite a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So everything was good for awhile.</v>

442
00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:01.240
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got in.</v>

443
00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:05.560
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you how good it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got in and my whole family got in.</v>

444
00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:10.890
<v Speaker 2>I decided to take my whole family to </v>
<v Speaker 2>England and in 1972 I moved there for a </v>

445
00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:15.871
<v Speaker 2>year and three months and it had the </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole family studies scientology in </v>

446
00:22:15.871 --> 00:22:15.871
<v Speaker 2>England.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

447
00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:21.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then came back for a little while </v>

448
00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:23.370
<v Speaker 2>and went over again in 1974 a study more</v>
<v Speaker 2>scientology when I was there that time I</v>

449
00:22:24.881 --> 00:22:29.881
<v Speaker 2>got a recording deal with the polydore </v>
<v Speaker 2>company solo album and I got a writer's </v>

450
00:22:30.071 --> 00:22:35.071
<v Speaker 2>contract with the chapels publishing and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got asked to plan BBC to all is in a </v>

451
00:22:35.071 --> 00:22:35.110
<v Speaker 2>book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

452
00:22:35.111 --> 00:22:35.870
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you the details.</v>

453
00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:39.610
<v Speaker 2>This was all while l Ron Hubbard was </v>
<v Speaker 2>alive while he was alive.</v>

454
00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:41.170
<v Speaker 2>And you meet him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never met him.</v>

455
00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:45.850
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But your son did listen to my son joined</v>

456
00:22:45.851 --> 00:22:47.980
<v Speaker 2>the sea organization when he was 16 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years old.</v>

457
00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:50.620
<v Speaker 2>Within seven months he was working with </v>
<v Speaker 2>l,</v>

458
00:22:50.621 --> 00:22:51.780
<v Speaker 2>Ron Hubbard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is this?</v>

459
00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:55.450
<v Speaker 2>The sea organization is explaining that </v>
<v Speaker 2>to people.</v>

460
00:22:55.630 --> 00:23:00.630
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are several different ways that </v>

461
00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:03.100
<v Speaker 2>you could do scientology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The number one way would be as if you're</v>

462
00:23:03.101 --> 00:23:07.420
<v Speaker 2>a public person and you just go into an </v>
<v Speaker 2>organization there called orgs.</v>

463
00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:12.280
<v Speaker 2>You go in and you buy services,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you live in the outside world.</v>

464
00:23:12.281 --> 00:23:14.320
<v Speaker 2>You have a job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a home,</v>

465
00:23:14.321 --> 00:23:17.350
<v Speaker 2>you know all these things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you pay for a service.</v>

466
00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:23.190
<v Speaker 2>That's number one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another level would be that you worked </v>

467
00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:26.550
<v Speaker 2>for an organization and you could sign a</v>
<v Speaker 2>two and a half year or a five year </v>

468
00:23:26.951 --> 00:23:31.180
<v Speaker 2>contract to work there and you get to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>billion year contracts to,</v>

469
00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:32.530
<v Speaker 2>well now what you're getting ahead of </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

470
00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:34.090
<v Speaker 2>That's public,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

471
00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:39.180
<v Speaker 2>that's working for an organization on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the level of a two and a half or five </v>

472
00:23:40.421 --> 00:23:45.421
<v Speaker 2>year contract.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The last step would be the sea </v>

473
00:23:45.421 --> 00:23:46.200
<v Speaker 2>organization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There you sign billion year contract.</v>

474
00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:49.280
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're signing away your future lives to</v>

475
00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:52.040
<v Speaker 2>get this scientology disseminated.</v>

476
00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:55.510
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has anybody ever challenged one of those</v>

477
00:23:55.511 --> 00:23:59.110
<v Speaker 2>billion year contracts?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what does it mean?</v>

478
00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:04.200
<v Speaker 2>Like do you listen to you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're getting the skinny and as hard as</v>

479
00:24:05.711 --> 00:24:10.180
<v Speaker 2>this is to believe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once you're in it for awhile and you see</v>

480
00:24:10.181 --> 00:24:12.670
<v Speaker 2>that this is helping you and maybe your </v>
<v Speaker 2>family,</v>

481
00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:16.960
<v Speaker 2>the point of is that they want to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>this disseminated to every man,</v>

482
00:24:16.961 --> 00:24:19.750
<v Speaker 2>woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and child on the planet and improve life</v>

483
00:24:19.751 --> 00:24:24.751
<v Speaker 2>for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like you're on this crusade to </v>

484
00:24:24.751 --> 00:24:28.471
<v Speaker 2>get it disseminated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they believe they're doing this to </v>

485
00:24:28.471 --> 00:24:28.471
<v Speaker 2>help people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

486
00:24:28.471 --> 00:24:28.670
<v Speaker 2>It all sounds good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

487
00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:30.100
<v Speaker 2>All sounds good in the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

488
00:24:30.101 --> 00:24:32.440
<v Speaker 2>it reads better than the lips.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that way at all.</v>

489
00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:33.820
<v Speaker 2>What will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how is it?</v>

490
00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:36.860
<v Speaker 2>How is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you these days right now,</v>

491
00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:37.780
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

492
00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:44.580
<v Speaker 2>They get people to donate money to </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's called the International </v>

493
00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:48.460
<v Speaker 2>Association of scientologists or donate </v>
<v Speaker 2>money to build an organization,</v>

494
00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:52.390
<v Speaker 2>build a new church someplace and it give</v>
<v Speaker 2>you a piece of paper and commend you.</v>

495
00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:53.890
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a nice business,</v>

496
00:24:53.891 --> 00:24:54.820
<v Speaker 2>low overhead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

497
00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:57.100
<v Speaker 2>so you give them money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they give you paper,</v>

498
00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:01.410
<v Speaker 2>they gave you a commendation or saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're the devil,</v>

499
00:25:01.690 --> 00:25:02.170
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

500
00:25:02.171 --> 00:25:03.250
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've achieved.</v>

501
00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:04.230
<v Speaker 2>The thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

502
00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:06.730
<v Speaker 2>they've opened a lot of new buildings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Joe,</v>

503
00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:09.280
<v Speaker 2>there's not people in air.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's air,</v>

504
00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:11.350
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they say we're expanding.</v>

505
00:25:11.351 --> 00:25:13.120
<v Speaker 2>They're expanding the real estate </v>
<v Speaker 2>interest,</v>

506
00:25:13.330 --> 00:25:18.330
<v Speaker 2>but they're not expanding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The number of people in scientology was </v>

507
00:25:18.330 --> 00:25:18.330
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

508
00:25:18.330 --> 00:25:22.681
<v Speaker 2>if you go on the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can find out all the abuses they've </v>

509
00:25:22.681 --> 00:25:25.681
<v Speaker 2>done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like people going bankrupt because they </v>

510
00:25:25.681 --> 00:25:28.201
<v Speaker 2>had to contribute so much money that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>get a second and third mortgage on her </v>

511
00:25:28.201 --> 00:25:28.201
<v Speaker 2>house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give it to the church.</v>

512
00:25:28.201 --> 00:25:30.190
<v Speaker 2>They can't afford it after they've </v>
<v Speaker 2>declared bankruptcy.</v>

513
00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:32.680
<v Speaker 2>People being disconnected from their </v>
<v Speaker 2>families.</v>

514
00:25:32.681 --> 00:25:33.640
<v Speaker 2>That.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's talk about that.</v>

515
00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:38.960
<v Speaker 2>Bill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to go back to the sea org thing </v>

516
00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:38.960
<v Speaker 2>for a second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then let's talk about that.</v>

517
00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:42.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the sea org thing is your son joins </v>

518
00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:42.840
<v Speaker 2>the sea org when he's 16 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's what happened.</v>

519
00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:48.030
<v Speaker 2>I came home from work one day and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>laying on his in his room on his bed,</v>

520
00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:51.720
<v Speaker 2>kind of like that with his head in his </v>
<v Speaker 2>hands as they day.</v>

521
00:25:51.721 --> 00:25:53.380
<v Speaker 2>What's up man?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>

522
00:25:53.381 --> 00:25:58.381
<v Speaker 2>Daddy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to go to school anymore is </v>

523
00:25:58.381 --> 00:25:58.381
<v Speaker 2>why not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

524
00:25:58.381 --> 00:25:58.750
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the kids are taking drugs,</v>

525
00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:03.780
<v Speaker 2>they just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't show the teachers any </v>

526
00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:07.471
<v Speaker 2>respect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not willing to learn anything I </v>

527
00:26:07.471 --> 00:26:07.471
<v Speaker 2>want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to join this year.</v>

528
00:26:07.471 --> 00:26:11.050
<v Speaker 2>I want to help l Ron Hubbard because by </v>
<v Speaker 2>this time we've been to England twice.</v>

529
00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:16.560
<v Speaker 2>He's trained to be an auditor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>An auditor is a person who applies this </v>

530
00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:19.510
<v Speaker 2>technology of scientology in auditing or</v>
<v Speaker 2>counseling.</v>

531
00:26:19.511 --> 00:26:21.170
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

532
00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:24.010
<v Speaker 2>this is what I want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought to myself,</v>

533
00:26:24.610 --> 00:26:26.080
<v Speaker 2>he's 15,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's going to be 16.</v>

534
00:26:26.081 --> 00:26:28.420
<v Speaker 2>Shortly after that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

535
00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:31.150
<v Speaker 2>when I was 17,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I joined the marines.</v>

536
00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:37.320
<v Speaker 2>My Dad had assigned for me because I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>only 17 and it probably was one of the </v>

537
00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:38.170
<v Speaker 2>best moves I ever made.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

538
00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:41.470
<v Speaker 2>the first night in bootcamp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said to myself,</v>

539
00:26:41.770 --> 00:26:44.250
<v Speaker 2>this is the worst fucking mistake ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>made in my life.</v>

540
00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:47.760
<v Speaker 2>At that moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>12 weeks later,</v>

541
00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:51.330
<v Speaker 2>I said to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can make myself do anything,</v>

542
00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:57.220
<v Speaker 2>and in that 12 weeks it turned me from </v>
<v Speaker 2>an undisciplined civilian into a </v>

543
00:26:57.220 --> 00:26:59.190
<v Speaker 2>discipline marine and I've utilized </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

544
00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:03.450
<v Speaker 2>My whole life has helped me always.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of looked at that and I thought,</v>

545
00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:05.460
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was 17,</v>

546
00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:08.160
<v Speaker 2>maybe it looked like I didn't know what </v>
<v Speaker 2>the hell I was doing,</v>

547
00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:12.690
<v Speaker 2>but I come out of winter and if David </v>
<v Speaker 2>wants to do this and what is he going to</v>

548
00:27:12.691 --> 00:27:16.320
<v Speaker 2>get out of going to school and he has no</v>
<v Speaker 2>desire to do anything else.</v>

549
00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:17.130
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

550
00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:19.500
<v Speaker 2>I'll help you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was it.</v>

551
00:27:19.501 --> 00:27:23.460
<v Speaker 2>So when he was 16,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the next day we put them on a plane.</v>

552
00:27:23.461 --> 00:27:26.660
<v Speaker 2>He went down to the flag land base in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Florida and they say,</v>

553
00:27:26.661 --> 00:27:28.050
<v Speaker 2>well then I think it was seven or eight </v>
<v Speaker 2>months,</v>

554
00:27:28.051 --> 00:27:31.500
<v Speaker 2>he was working right with l Ron Hubbard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fornia the sea org.</v>

555
00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:33.780
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it a boat you're actually on a boat?</v>

556
00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:38.880
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sea organization is a term used </v>

557
00:27:39.511 --> 00:27:44.511
<v Speaker 2>because in 1967,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ron started what he called the sea </v>

558
00:27:45.121 --> 00:27:50.121
<v Speaker 2>project where he bought these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ship and invited people to come with</v>

559
00:27:50.551 --> 00:27:55.551
<v Speaker 2>him to contribute to this project saying</v>
<v Speaker 2>that his research could be done better </v>

560
00:27:57.931 --> 00:28:00.190
<v Speaker 2>away from land masses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

561
00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:02.820
<v Speaker 2>in fact the law was after him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that,</v>

562
00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:04.020
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a tax thing,</v>

563
00:28:04.021 --> 00:28:04.830
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

564
00:28:04.831 --> 00:28:09.831
<v Speaker 2>I mean they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were trying to snag them and when </v>

565
00:28:09.831 --> 00:28:10.830
<v Speaker 2>you're out out in international waters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can serve you a subpoena,</v>

566
00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:13.710
<v Speaker 2>but it was such an adventure story.</v>

567
00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:15.040
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people look over,</v>

568
00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:17.790
<v Speaker 2>look at plus to get to where it </v>
<v Speaker 2>captain's outfit.</v>

569
00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:19.380
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not everybody.</v>

570
00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:21.000
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

571
00:28:21.390 --> 00:28:24.660
<v Speaker 2>admiral.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He give himself metals l,</v>

572
00:28:24.661 --> 00:28:25.710
<v Speaker 2>Ron Hubbard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

573
00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.270
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never saw that.</v>

574
00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:29.490
<v Speaker 2>All I saw was that he was considered the</v>
<v Speaker 2>commodore,</v>

575
00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:33.060
<v Speaker 2>but you remember the Peace Corps?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

576
00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:38.350
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was an adventure and people would </v>

577
00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:38.350
<v Speaker 2>go on our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they actually were doing something.</v>

578
00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:39.270
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was the sea org doing?</v>

579
00:28:39.390 --> 00:28:42.390
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the CEO was on this ship and they'd have</v>

580
00:28:42.391 --> 00:28:44.610
<v Speaker 2>people come there for advanced level </v>
<v Speaker 2>services,</v>

581
00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:50.120
<v Speaker 2>get that and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would send missions out to various </v>

582
00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:54.771
<v Speaker 2>organizations to correct any out indices</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the way maybe they were delivering </v>

583
00:28:54.771 --> 00:28:57.210
<v Speaker 2>the technology or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or fix something that was going wrong.</v>

584
00:28:57.390 --> 00:29:02.390
<v Speaker 2>It was run like a military organization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the sea org went ashore and </v>

585
00:29:04.831 --> 00:29:07.260
<v Speaker 2>they established the flag land base in </v>
<v Speaker 2>clearwater,</v>

586
00:29:07.261 --> 00:29:07.680
<v Speaker 2>Florida.</v>

587
00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:14.500
<v Speaker 2>So that is still referred to as flag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yet,</v>

588
00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:19.740
<v Speaker 2>when El Rey to Lr and Hubbard had the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ships that was going to consider the </v>

589
00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:19.740
<v Speaker 2>flagship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

590
00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:24.060
<v Speaker 2>Am I filling you in an definition?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he joined that.</v>

591
00:29:24.090 --> 00:29:25.860
<v Speaker 2>He ascended through the ranks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's working with l,</v>

592
00:29:25.861 --> 00:29:27.630
<v Speaker 2>Ron Hubbard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and slowly.</v>

593
00:29:27.631 --> 00:29:29.460
<v Speaker 2>You guys get disconnected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what happens?</v>

594
00:29:29.490 --> 00:29:30.630
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as matter of fact,</v>

595
00:29:30.631 --> 00:29:33.630
<v Speaker 2>when he was doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were still in very good communication</v>

596
00:29:33.631 --> 00:29:36.390
<v Speaker 2>with each other like I'm telling you </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

597
00:29:38.010 --> 00:29:40.260
<v Speaker 2>We had a lot of great times together </v>
<v Speaker 2>when he was growing up.</v>

598
00:29:40.390 --> 00:29:45.390
<v Speaker 2>It no two ways about it and I can't say </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it was like bad relationship in any</v>

599
00:29:45.791 --> 00:29:46.120
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

600
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.100
<v Speaker 2>There was a guy by the name of Lord </v>
<v Speaker 2>Acton.</v>

601
00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:54.730
<v Speaker 2>He was a Britisher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a member of parliament.</v>

602
00:29:54.731 --> 00:29:59.731
<v Speaker 2>He lived from 1834 to early 19 hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's the one that made the observation.</v>

603
00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:05.410
<v Speaker 2>Power tends to corrupt and absolute </v>
<v Speaker 2>power corrupts.</v>

604
00:30:05.411 --> 00:30:10.411
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think this is what happened to </v>

605
00:30:10.411 --> 00:30:11.800
<v Speaker 2>David,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that when l Ron Hubbard died,</v>

606
00:30:12.490 --> 00:30:17.490
<v Speaker 2>he saw a chance to move up and you got </v>
<v Speaker 2>people out of the way who didn't want to</v>

607
00:30:19.001 --> 00:30:24.001
<v Speaker 2>cooperate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Him Put people on various posts that </v>

608
00:30:24.001 --> 00:30:25.810
<v Speaker 2>would cooperate with them and he took </v>
<v Speaker 2>over the ownership and the leadership of</v>

609
00:30:25.811 --> 00:30:30.811
<v Speaker 2>scientology and what contributed to that</v>
<v Speaker 2>was an incident where he had a severe </v>

610
00:30:31.391 --> 00:30:35.590
<v Speaker 2>asthmatic attack and they had to take </v>
<v Speaker 2>him to the emergency room of a hospital.</v>

611
00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:40.950
<v Speaker 2>Paul Grady's a guy that took him there </v>
<v Speaker 2>and when Paul pick them up after they </v>

612
00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:43.420
<v Speaker 2>did the stuff that the handle him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was okay.</v>

613
00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:45.880
<v Speaker 2>They would set the Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>

614
00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:51.660
<v Speaker 2>I had a great realization when I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>there and it's this power is not </v>

615
00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:53.440
<v Speaker 2>granted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is assumed.</v>

616
00:30:54.490 --> 00:30:58.780
<v Speaker 2>So he assumed the leadership of </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientology and heroes right to the top.</v>

617
00:30:59.410 --> 00:31:04.410
<v Speaker 2>That's how that happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how did you get disconnected from </v>

618
00:31:04.410 --> 00:31:04.420
<v Speaker 2>them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

619
00:31:04.930 --> 00:31:09.930
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was an event that he had none of </v>

620
00:31:09.931 --> 00:31:11.110
<v Speaker 2>the event.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something that he did,</v>

621
00:31:11.111 --> 00:31:16.111
<v Speaker 2>which he'll always be admired for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got actually got the Church of </v>

622
00:31:16.111 --> 00:31:18.340
<v Speaker 2>scientology tax exemption.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>

623
00:31:19.030 --> 00:31:24.030
<v Speaker 2>He literally got the irs to grant the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fact that this is a church you have now </v>

624
00:31:24.041 --> 00:31:25.900
<v Speaker 2>a tax exemption.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People contribute to it,</v>

625
00:31:25.901 --> 00:31:29.140
<v Speaker 2>can you deduct it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a very,</v>

626
00:31:29.141 --> 00:31:32.620
<v Speaker 2>very big win that then gave him power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

627
00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:37.060
<v Speaker 2>I decided to join this organization in </v>
<v Speaker 2>1985.</v>

628
00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:40.000
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to contribute to doing whatever</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could to help him.</v>

629
00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:45.670
<v Speaker 2>I joined the Sea Organization and I'm at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Hamate base,</v>

630
00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:50.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm coming out of the music studio </v>

631
00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:54.091
<v Speaker 2>because since I was a musician,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I worked in the music studio and we did </v>

632
00:31:54.091 --> 00:31:54.091
<v Speaker 2>films.</v>

633
00:31:54.091 --> 00:31:57.990
<v Speaker 2>I'd composed music for various technical</v>
<v Speaker 2>films we had or public relations films </v>

634
00:31:58.150 --> 00:32:03.150
<v Speaker 2>and I walked out of the studio one day </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I saw him a little distance off the </v>

635
00:32:03.150 --> 00:32:04.510
<v Speaker 2>left with an entourage and I yelled out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey dave.</v>

636
00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:08.350
<v Speaker 2>And he turned around and he looked at me</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm telling you,</v>

637
00:32:08.351 --> 00:32:13.351
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he gave me a look that I thought I </v>

638
00:32:13.351 --> 00:32:15.481
<v Speaker 2>better never do that again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On that base I was then a staff member.</v>

639
00:32:18.550 --> 00:32:22.970
<v Speaker 2>The fact that I was biologically his </v>
<v Speaker 2>father and in fact his father,</v>

640
00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:28.120
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he referred to me as Ron when he spoke </v>

641
00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:30.301
<v Speaker 2>to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When he sent me a gift for my birthday </v>

642
00:32:30.301 --> 00:32:30.301
<v Speaker 2>or Christmas or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He always had their dad,</v>

643
00:32:31.570 --> 00:32:34.810
<v Speaker 2>but that was the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now with further on down the road we got</v>

644
00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:40.260
<v Speaker 2>the more it became,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to have to call him after a </v>

645
00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:40.720
<v Speaker 2>while.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

646
00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:44.570
<v Speaker 2>It became more and more me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ron Miscavige,</v>

647
00:32:44.571 --> 00:32:47.900
<v Speaker 2>the staff member,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and David is the leader of the church.</v>

648
00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:54.100
<v Speaker 2>Once they started implementing the rules</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the base where you couldn't send a </v>

649
00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:58.241
<v Speaker 2>letter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I without being checked where you </v>

650
00:32:58.241 --> 00:33:00.880
<v Speaker 2>surrounded with barb wire pointing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>pointing out you couldn't talk on the </v>

651
00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:01.280
<v Speaker 2>telephone without having somebody </v>
<v Speaker 2>listen.</v>

652
00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:06.580
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't drive off on your own to go</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a store to get a fucking pair of </v>

653
00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:07.730
<v Speaker 2>underwear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You had to order it on the Internet.</v>

654
00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:11.690
<v Speaker 2>If you got on the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a filter on it.</v>

655
00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:14.060
<v Speaker 2>Were anything about miscavige for </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientology?</v>

656
00:33:14.061 --> 00:33:15.080
<v Speaker 2>Come up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd be blocked.</v>

657
00:33:16.610 --> 00:33:20.450
<v Speaker 2>So now I'm living a sequestered life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Waking up in the morning,</v>

658
00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:23.510
<v Speaker 2>going to breakfast at 9:00,</v>
<v Speaker 2>9:30.</v>

659
00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:25.790
<v Speaker 2>Having a muster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know to muster is no.</v>

660
00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:28.160
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You line up your account for everybody.</v>

661
00:33:28.550 --> 00:33:30.800
<v Speaker 2>Alright?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Twelve o'clock,</v>

662
00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:34.430
<v Speaker 2>go to lunch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>12 30 lineup for another muster.</v>

663
00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:37.190
<v Speaker 2>Go to work in the afternoon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>5:00,</v>

664
00:33:37.191 --> 00:33:38.660
<v Speaker 2>go to dinner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>5:30,</v>

665
00:33:38.661 --> 00:33:41.240
<v Speaker 2>go to another muster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then work the rest of the night,</v>

666
00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:43.370
<v Speaker 2>or sometimes 9:30</v>
<v Speaker 2>or 10:00,</v>

667
00:33:43.390 --> 00:33:46.400
<v Speaker 2>have another muster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was my life seven days a week,</v>

668
00:33:46.401 --> 00:33:51.401
<v Speaker 2>except on Saturday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd work on the grounds to beautify </v>

669
00:33:51.401 --> 00:33:52.520
<v Speaker 2>the base.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't sound good time,</v>

670
00:33:52.521 --> 00:33:54.350
<v Speaker 2>Ron.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a great existence.</v>

671
00:33:54.351 --> 00:33:58.040
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how would you like to live that way?</v>

672
00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:00.230
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't sound good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't good.</v>

673
00:34:00.231 --> 00:34:02.150
<v Speaker 2>Stuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

674
00:34:02.450 --> 00:34:07.450
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were enough times when I did </v>

675
00:34:07.450 --> 00:34:12.341
<v Speaker 2>things that were good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we would do an album and it was a </v>

676
00:34:12.341 --> 00:34:13.250
<v Speaker 2>matter of fact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's something that we didn't.</v>

677
00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:18.020
<v Speaker 2>I first got in and there was a book that</v>
<v Speaker 2>came out called mission earth that l Ron</v>

678
00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:23.020
<v Speaker 2>Hubbard wrote Edgar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you remember Edgar Winter Know </v>

679
00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:24.020
<v Speaker 2>Edgar Winter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Johnny winters brother?</v>

680
00:34:24.170 --> 00:34:25.610
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She musician the musician.</v>

681
00:34:25.611 --> 00:34:26.450
<v Speaker 2>The Rock Guy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

682
00:34:26.740 --> 00:34:27.090
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

683
00:34:27.140 --> 00:34:29.420
<v Speaker 2>Edgar came to the base and we did an </v>
<v Speaker 2>album.</v>

684
00:34:29.421 --> 00:34:33.830
<v Speaker 2>I played on the album with him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Edgar winter just scientology was.</v>

685
00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:35.790
<v Speaker 2>He probably still is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

686
00:34:36.170 --> 00:34:37.040
<v Speaker 2>One of them's dead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

687
00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:39.350
<v Speaker 2>John said Johnny's dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Edgar,</v>

688
00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:45.100
<v Speaker 2>I mean he was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have no idea how good he is until </v>

689
00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:45.110
<v Speaker 2>you see them operating a studio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

690
00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:48.650
<v Speaker 2>I played the trumpet parts on the album,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I played solos and some of this stuff,</v>

691
00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:53.920
<v Speaker 2>the album,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was what I did and it was great </v>

692
00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:53.920
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bust your ass working,</v>

693
00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:56.360
<v Speaker 2>but that's a good time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right Isaac Hayes.</v>

694
00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:59.660
<v Speaker 2>I used to do gigs with him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

695
00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:03.830
<v Speaker 2>chase's great guy and those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those were fun times.</v>

696
00:35:03.831 --> 00:35:06.170
<v Speaker 2>There were other things that we did that</v>
<v Speaker 2>turned out good,</v>

697
00:35:06.890 --> 00:35:11.890
<v Speaker 2>but then there's time in between where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're working sometimes days on end </v>

698
00:35:11.890 --> 00:35:13.070
<v Speaker 2>with when the okay a couple of days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no sleep,</v>

699
00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:18.880
<v Speaker 2>working your ass off and if you screwed </v>
<v Speaker 2>up it was hell to pay and kind of work </v>

700
00:35:19.191 --> 00:35:19.850
<v Speaker 2>is being done.</v>

701
00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:21.380
<v Speaker 2>What does all the work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

702
00:35:21.381 --> 00:35:26.381
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you an example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's about six major events that are </v>

703
00:35:26.381 --> 00:35:29.550
<v Speaker 2>done by the church every year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's the a.</v>

704
00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:32.780
<v Speaker 2>In new years there's a major event.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

705
00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:38.620
<v Speaker 2>And then in March you have l,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ron Hubbard birthday and then in May you</v>

706
00:35:39.061 --> 00:35:40.940
<v Speaker 2>have dianetics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright guys,</v>

707
00:35:41.010 --> 00:35:42.480
<v Speaker 2>what do you guys do for Ellen's </v>
<v Speaker 2>birthday?</v>

708
00:35:43.070 --> 00:35:45.270
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there would be any event where you would</v>

709
00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:51.260
<v Speaker 2>show him in various aspects of life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>improving life in some aspect and we'd </v>

710
00:35:51.381 --> 00:35:54.420
<v Speaker 2>have a video on that and we would have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to write music for that.</v>

711
00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:59.760
<v Speaker 2>A city would have to shoot the pictures </v>
<v Speaker 2>or take old pictures and produce these,</v>

712
00:35:59.761 --> 00:36:04.761
<v Speaker 2>edit them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We do music for it and we'd have a </v>

713
00:36:04.761 --> 00:36:07.581
<v Speaker 2>product to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had an event when David's the one </v>

714
00:36:07.581 --> 00:36:09.591
<v Speaker 2>event,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they could present this for when the </v>

715
00:36:09.591 --> 00:36:11.460
<v Speaker 2>anniversary of dianetics modern science </v>
<v Speaker 2>of mental health.</v>

716
00:36:11.461 --> 00:36:12.330
<v Speaker 2>That was another event.</v>

717
00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:14.580
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then in your preparing for events,</v>

718
00:36:14.581 --> 00:36:17.250
<v Speaker 2>essentially all the time it was when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd end one,</v>

719
00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:22.280
<v Speaker 2>you'd have start the next one in June </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have the anniversary of the maiden </v>

720
00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:24.000
<v Speaker 2>voyage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was something we did every year and</v>

721
00:36:24.001 --> 00:36:26.580
<v Speaker 2>then there's auditor's Day in August.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

722
00:36:26.581 --> 00:36:31.581
<v Speaker 2>and then there's the international </v>
<v Speaker 2>association of Scientology Event in </v>

723
00:36:31.581 --> 00:36:34.851
<v Speaker 2>October.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So all this time you're just constantly </v>

724
00:36:34.851 --> 00:36:34.851
<v Speaker 2>working.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're never hanging out with your son.</v>

725
00:36:34.851 --> 00:36:38.871
<v Speaker 2>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have any quality time </v>

726
00:36:38.871 --> 00:36:40.551
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes he would come to the base for </v>

727
00:36:40.551 --> 00:36:40.551
<v Speaker 2>two months and wouldn't even give me a </v>
<v Speaker 2>phone call.</v>

728
00:36:41.250 --> 00:36:42.500
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

729
00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:47.510
<v Speaker 2>you got to understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish the fuck this didn't turn out </v>

730
00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:47.510
<v Speaker 2>this way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

731
00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:50.630
<v Speaker 2>Just straight up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I will feel responsible in any way </v>

732
00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:50.850
<v Speaker 2>for bringing them in.</v>

733
00:36:53.310 --> 00:36:58.310
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody deals with life the way they </v>

734
00:36:58.310 --> 00:37:01.131
<v Speaker 2>deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My other son isn't that way in my </v>

735
00:37:01.131 --> 00:37:01.131
<v Speaker 2>daughters aren't that way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is your other son.</v>

736
00:37:01.131 --> 00:37:03.180
<v Speaker 2>Scientology as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's on a scientology now.</v>

737
00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:05.460
<v Speaker 2>Did he quit with you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He quit earlier than me.</v>

738
00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:07.380
<v Speaker 2>And what about your daughters?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're in.</v>

739
00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:08.760
<v Speaker 2>They're in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

740
00:37:08.910 --> 00:37:12.030
<v Speaker 2>And if they were connected from them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're disconnected from me.</v>

741
00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:13.000
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not allowed to.</v>

742
00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:15.630
<v Speaker 2>They're not allowed to talk to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's what happens though.</v>

743
00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:20.660
<v Speaker 2>If they were to talk to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're friends would disconnect from </v>

744
00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:23.901
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have a job with the scientology </v>

745
00:37:23.901 --> 00:37:23.901
<v Speaker 2>employer and they found out that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>talked to me,</v>

746
00:37:23.970 --> 00:37:27.450
<v Speaker 2>he would get fired that day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's insidious.</v>

747
00:37:27.451 --> 00:37:32.280
<v Speaker 2>It spreads out the penalty for talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>to what's called a suppressive person,</v>

748
00:37:32.281 --> 00:37:36.930
<v Speaker 2>which would be me like real life prick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As an example,</v>

749
00:37:37.230 --> 00:37:42.230
<v Speaker 2>when I was 70 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>David and my two daughters bought me a </v>

750
00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:42.230
<v Speaker 2>car.</v>

751
00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:43.980
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A car,</v>

752
00:37:44.430 --> 00:37:47.940
<v Speaker 2>when I was 75 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my daughter sent me 75 gifts.</v>

753
00:37:48.690 --> 00:37:53.690
<v Speaker 2>Now I left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm the worst father who's ever </v>

754
00:37:53.690 --> 00:37:53.690
<v Speaker 2>lived.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a slimeball.</v>

755
00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:56.400
<v Speaker 2>They character assassinate me and their </v>
<v Speaker 2>hate sites.</v>

756
00:37:57.360 --> 00:37:59.460
<v Speaker 2>They would give a card to somebody who </v>
<v Speaker 2>was that bad.</v>

757
00:37:59.550 --> 00:38:00.570
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we made a mistake.</v>

758
00:38:00.571 --> 00:38:01.920
<v Speaker 2>He really was a prick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the along.</v>

759
00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:06.030
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you're trying to make sense out of</v>

760
00:38:06.031 --> 00:38:07.080
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't make sense.</v>

761
00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:09.870
<v Speaker 2>But this is built into the policy of </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientology.</v>

762
00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:14.900
<v Speaker 2>Anybody who leaves could be in says </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything about the church could be </v>

763
00:38:15.061 --> 00:38:20.061
<v Speaker 2>considered to be a suppressive person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And was this always the case or is this </v>

764
00:38:20.061 --> 00:38:21.420
<v Speaker 2>Polish exacerbated?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

765
00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:23.610
<v Speaker 2>l Ron Hubbard wrote the policies while </v>
<v Speaker 2>he was alive.</v>

766
00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:27.060
<v Speaker 2>He also wrote more fiction than anybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's ever lived.</v>

767
00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:32.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does everybody know that inside the </v>

768
00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:32.120
<v Speaker 2>church?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

769
00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:32.460
<v Speaker 2>they probably do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

770
00:38:32.610 --> 00:38:35.740
<v Speaker 2>But didn't they?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does anybody make that connection?</v>

771
00:38:35.810 --> 00:38:36.110
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

772
00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:42.060
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy wrote more fake shit than any </v>

773
00:38:42.060 --> 00:38:42.430
<v Speaker 1>person that's ever walked the face of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the earth.</v>

774
00:38:42.490 --> 00:38:47.320
<v Speaker 1>But he also had the time to talk to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>aliens to get all this data.</v>

775
00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:52.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To write this real stuff that is just,</v>

776
00:38:53.770 --> 00:38:55.360
<v Speaker 1>that is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

777
00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:59.410
<v Speaker 1>that's a suspension of disbelief that </v>
<v Speaker 1>defies logic.</v>

778
00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:03.490
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as fries defies understanding,</v>

779
00:39:03.650 --> 00:39:07.030
<v Speaker 1>as you said earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just need to get to a higher otc.</v>

780
00:39:07.090 --> 00:39:11.040
<v Speaker 1>What is it that it Ota level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Operating level.</v>

781
00:39:11.060 --> 00:39:16.060
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you got to understand most people </v>

782
00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:18.010
<v Speaker 1>who do it don't have rocks in your head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not nuts.</v>

783
00:39:18.011 --> 00:39:19.670
<v Speaker 1>They're not stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People know I've talked.</v>

784
00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:21.300
<v Speaker 1>I had a neighbor who was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientologist,</v>

785
00:39:21.301 --> 00:39:22.550
<v Speaker 1>a very nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

786
00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:26.080
<v Speaker 1>And he sort of fit that bill that I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking to get it earlier,</v>

787
00:39:26.130 --> 00:39:31.130
<v Speaker 1>but he fit that bill that I was talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about earlier where he's a guy that's </v>

788
00:39:31.130 --> 00:39:31.660
<v Speaker 1>always improving himself.</v>

789
00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:36.680
<v Speaker 1>He was healthy exercise dbs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well captiva was a nice neighbor.</v>

790
00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:38.950
<v Speaker 1>It was a good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

791
00:39:39.630 --> 00:39:40.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

792
00:39:40.511 --> 00:39:41.160
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

793
00:39:41.161 --> 00:39:44.800
<v Speaker 1>I sort of looked into scientology after </v>
<v Speaker 1>I became friends with him,</v>

794
00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:47.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

795
00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:49.510
<v Speaker 1>I got the book early on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

796
00:39:49.511 --> 00:39:51.550
<v Speaker 1>but I never really did anything other </v>
<v Speaker 1>than read the book.</v>

797
00:39:51.551 --> 00:39:54.760
<v Speaker 1>I never looked into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is before the Internet,</v>

798
00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:59.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the internet sort of exposed all this </v>

799
00:39:59.870 --> 00:39:59.870
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was the end of it.</v>

800
00:39:59.870 --> 00:40:04.260
<v Speaker 1>That literal use literally and tall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how much has it dropped off since </v>

801
00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:04.260
<v Speaker 1>then?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

802
00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:08.200
<v Speaker 1>it's been estimated by people who would </v>
<v Speaker 1>know that there's maybe 20,000</v>

803
00:40:08.201 --> 00:40:10.660
<v Speaker 1>scientologists right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was it at its peak?</v>

804
00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:12.540
<v Speaker 1>I think it was in the early 90 </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

805
00:40:12.541 --> 00:40:14.230
<v Speaker 1>About 100,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

806
00:40:14.270 --> 00:40:15.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

840
00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:45.230
<v Speaker 2>which I thought was pretty interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but anyway,</v>

841
00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:47.090
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to get the says,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

846
00:41:52.701 --> 00:41:57.701
<v Speaker 2>one day I'm reading something and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a feature on here where you see </v>

847
00:41:58.011 --> 00:42:00.410
<v Speaker 2>this is the camera on that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

00:42:01.010 --> 00:42:02.720
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see this little</v>

849
00:42:04.610 --> 00:42:08.990

850
00:42:09.310 --> 00:42:14.310
<v Speaker 2>down and in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you got a word that you'd like to </v>

00:42:14.310 --> 00:42:19.301
<v Speaker 2>look up and get the meaning of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd go to the library or not the </v>

<v Speaker 2>library,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dictionary,</v>

853
00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:25.540
<v Speaker 2>and you'd select the award and pressure </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the right and it would say search </v>

854
00:42:25.730 --> 00:42:30.730
<v Speaker 2>store.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I accidentally held it a little bit too </v>

855
00:42:30.730 --> 00:42:33.440
<v Speaker 2>long and it went right past search store</v>
<v Speaker 2>to google.</v>

00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:38.570
<v Speaker 2>I was on the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will no filter with your kindle,</v>

<v Speaker 2>There's no filter on this.</v>

861
00:42:52.490 --> 00:42:55.430
<v Speaker 2>That's why the security guards were </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to get it,</v>

862
00:42:55.460 --> 00:42:58.460
<v Speaker 2>but they wouldn't tell me that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously they're not going to say,</v>

863
00:42:58.461 --> 00:43:03.461
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no filter so you can get on the </v>

864
00:43:03.461 --> 00:43:03.461

<v Speaker 2>There aren't the sharpest knives in the </v>

866
00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:05.320
<v Speaker 2>drawer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:07.220
<v Speaker 2>But how did they know that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How they know about that?</v>

868
00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:12.600
<v Speaker 2>They're the ones who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you get a computer that you give it </v>

869
00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:15.161
<v Speaker 2>to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they put a filter on it and then I give </v>

870
00:43:15.161 --> 00:43:15.161
<v Speaker 2>it back to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

871
00:43:15.161 --> 00:43:15.161
<v Speaker 2>So they just know they've got some </v>
<v Speaker 2>techno geeks do.</v>

872
00:43:15.161 --> 00:43:19.931
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how to do that shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they had never done that to the </v>

873
00:43:19.931 --> 00:43:19.931
<v Speaker 2>kindle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they wanted to go.</v>

874
00:43:19.931 --> 00:43:24.761
<v Speaker 2>They wanted to take it away from me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Straight up googling stuff with your </v>

875
00:43:24.761 --> 00:43:24.761
<v Speaker 2>kindle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I looked at Google now,</v>

876
00:43:24.761 --> 00:43:29.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first time I've told that story </v>

877
00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:31.830
<v Speaker 2>about Joseph an exclusive UNICO.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Excited.</v>

878
00:43:32.070 --> 00:43:33.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

879
00:43:33.051 --> 00:43:37.220
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you one of the things I looked</v>
<v Speaker 2>at as like l Ron Hubbard's war record.</v>

880
00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:38.870
<v Speaker 2>He was not a hero.</v>

881
00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:43.610
<v Speaker 2>You didn't have two purple hearts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's fucking made up story.</v>

882
00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:49.780
<v Speaker 2>And there was a girl named Annie Tillman</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was with l Ron Hubbard when he died.</v>

883
00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:55.760
<v Speaker 2>And tinman was a messenger with l Ron </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hubbard since she was a little girl and </v>

884
00:43:57.681 --> 00:44:02.681
<v Speaker 2>she was with him when he actually died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Annie was a long term loyal </v>

885
00:44:04.071 --> 00:44:09.071
<v Speaker 2>scientologists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's at the base where I lived in </v>

886
00:44:09.071 --> 00:44:12.761
<v Speaker 2>Hamilton and she got lung cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they sent her to Los Angeles to get </v>

887
00:44:13.401 --> 00:44:18.401
<v Speaker 2>care and they sent a girl down to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a personal servant to take care of </v>

888
00:44:18.401 --> 00:44:19.370
<v Speaker 2>her needs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so she'd be okay.</v>

889
00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:24.260
<v Speaker 2>So occasionally I would say to Martin </v>
<v Speaker 2>who was the medical liaison officer.</v>

890
00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:30.430
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she took care of our health and she'd </v>

891
00:44:30.430 --> 00:44:30.430
<v Speaker 2>have us go to the doctors and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

892
00:44:30.430 --> 00:44:30.770
<v Speaker 2>Martin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how's Andy Doing?</v>

893
00:44:30.990 --> 00:44:31.590
<v Speaker 2>Ohhh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ronnie.</v>

894
00:44:31.591 --> 00:44:32.700
<v Speaker 2>She's doing a great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

895
00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:33.480
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

896
00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:37.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm on a kindle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She died six months earlier,</v>

897
00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:44.180
<v Speaker 2>never told anybody innovation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we're living in these apartments on </v>

898
00:44:44.180 --> 00:44:44.460
<v Speaker 2>the base.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it?</v>

899
00:44:44.461 --> 00:44:49.461
<v Speaker 2>Several days later and there was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>building called the laundry room where </v>

900
00:44:49.461 --> 00:44:51.540

<v Speaker 2>little Amenia ds like that and there's </v>

902
00:44:56.541 --> 00:44:57.420
<v Speaker 2>two girls outside the laundry room and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

904
00:44:59.341 --> 00:45:02.160
<v Speaker 2>present for Annie?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Nah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>but he's not really a bad kid.</v>

923
00:46:01.221 --> 00:46:02.640
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's hanging out with the wrong guys and</v>

924
00:46:02.641 --> 00:46:03.400
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah blah.</v>

925
00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:08.660
<v Speaker 2>And these are all saying the shit that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't say to this exclusive </v>

926
00:46:08.660 --> 00:46:11.360
<v Speaker 2>audience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>David hears that to handle this.</v>

927
00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:16.590
<v Speaker 2>Me and the rest of the band were sent to</v>
<v Speaker 2>work in the bilge on the ship</v>

928
00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:20.480
<v Speaker 2>because he fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We paid the price.</v>

929
00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:24.560
<v Speaker 2>What I should've done was kicked into </v>
<v Speaker 2>band because I was directing the band,</v>

930
00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:28.640
<v Speaker 2>kicked into band and start playing music</v>
<v Speaker 2>and drowned them out.</v>

931
00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:32.960
<v Speaker 2>You're going to build the temperature </v>
<v Speaker 2>down there is between $125.</v>

932
00:46:32.961 --> 00:46:35.660
<v Speaker 2>One hundred and 30 degrees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in my sixties.</v>

933
00:46:36.340 --> 00:46:39.920
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shit like that would go on.</v>

934
00:46:40.430 --> 00:46:42.410
<v Speaker 2>So when things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happened at that?</v>

935
00:46:42.411 --> 00:46:43.640
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can't live this way,</v>

936
00:46:43.641 --> 00:46:46.790
<v Speaker 2>but my wife Becky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she is an eternal optimist.</v>

937
00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:48.870
<v Speaker 2>She would always say run.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's gonna.</v>

938
00:46:48.890 --> 00:46:50.930
<v Speaker 2>Get better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can't keep on going this way.</v>

939
00:46:51.650 --> 00:46:56.650
<v Speaker 2>And I'd say becky listening because she </v>
<v Speaker 2>a boulder rolling down a mountain that </v>

940
00:46:56.650 --> 00:46:58.400
<v Speaker 2>boulder is not going to stop and start </v>
<v Speaker 2>rolling up.</v>

941
00:46:58.650 --> 00:47:01.400
<v Speaker 2>It's going to get worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If things are going bad,</v>

942
00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:03.590
<v Speaker 2>they have a tendency to continue going </v>
<v Speaker 2>bad.</v>

943
00:47:04.070 --> 00:47:09.070
<v Speaker 2>It's just fantastic to me that you found</v>
<v Speaker 2>out all this information on Google.</v>

944
00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:12.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that you were shielded from all this</v>

945
00:47:12.051 --> 00:47:12.680
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

946
00:47:13.450 --> 00:47:15.020
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the craziest part.</v>

947
00:47:15.021 --> 00:47:16.880
<v Speaker 2>And you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were 75 at the time,</v>

948
00:47:18.290 --> 00:47:20.530
<v Speaker 2>somewhere in that ruined our vision at </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

949
00:47:20.570 --> 00:47:23.030
<v Speaker 2>I think it was two years later that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually escaped.</v>

950
00:47:23.210 --> 00:47:25.460
<v Speaker 2>So how did you escape?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

951
00:47:25.461 --> 00:47:30.461
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to run the music department and </v>

952
00:47:32.050 --> 00:47:37.050
<v Speaker 2>when I say run it and I'd make sure that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we did all the jobs were supposed to do </v>

953
00:47:37.050 --> 00:47:38.890
<v Speaker 2>and I would compose music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I worked with a guy by the name of Peter</v>

954
00:47:38.891 --> 00:47:41.690
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

955
00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:43.930
<v Speaker 2>we had some nice shit that we did </v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

956
00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:46.240
<v Speaker 2>So at this point you'd been in for how </v>
<v Speaker 2>many years?</v>

957
00:47:46.270 --> 00:47:47.260
<v Speaker 2>Forty years?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

958
00:47:47.290 --> 00:47:52.290
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Industry Organization over 20 some </v>

959
00:47:52.290 --> 00:47:54.451
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Twenty something years in the sea </v>

960
00:47:54.451 --> 00:47:54.451
<v Speaker 2>organization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All in all.</v>

961
00:47:54.451 --> 00:47:54.451
<v Speaker 2>Scientology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Much more than that.</v>

962
00:47:54.451 --> 00:47:57.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I was in scientology for 42 years.</v>

963
00:47:57.251 --> 00:47:59.200
<v Speaker 2>This is your only source of income?</v>

964
00:47:59.950 --> 00:48:00.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's 50.</v>

965
00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:01.660
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to begin with,</v>

966
00:48:01.661 --> 00:48:04.210
<v Speaker 2>when I got in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got 30 bucks a week.</v>

967
00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:08.290
<v Speaker 2>And then journalists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's that generous?</v>

968
00:48:09.270 --> 00:48:12.970
<v Speaker 2>When it went up to 15 year olds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you got paid,</v>

969
00:48:13.390 --> 00:48:18.390
<v Speaker 2>when you get paid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes you'd go for months without </v>

970
00:48:18.390 --> 00:48:22.501
<v Speaker 2>getting paid at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the downside of that is you ain't </v>

971
00:48:22.501 --> 00:48:26.281
<v Speaker 2>paying much into social security,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you leave like some of these </v>

972
00:48:26.281 --> 00:48:27.010
<v Speaker 2>people will leave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got shit for social security.</v>

973
00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:29.050
<v Speaker 2>They may have no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no place to go,</v>

974
00:48:29.051 --> 00:48:32.320
<v Speaker 2>no marketable skill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a no car,</v>

975
00:48:32.770 --> 00:48:34.460
<v Speaker 2>what are they going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

976
00:48:35.050 --> 00:48:35.680
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

977
00:48:35.681 --> 00:48:37.510
<v Speaker 2>people say will stay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They stay,</v>

978
00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:42.540
<v Speaker 2>they gutted out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the position that you were </v>

979
00:48:42.540 --> 00:48:42.540
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

980
00:48:42.540 --> 00:48:43.000
<v Speaker 2>What made you decide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

981
00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:47.130
<v Speaker 2>well just to Google information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

982
00:48:47.370 --> 00:48:47.930
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

983
00:48:47.950 --> 00:48:52.950
<v Speaker 2>It was the treatment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way people were being treated and </v>

984
00:48:52.950 --> 00:48:55.000
<v Speaker 2>some of the shit that went down like so </v>
<v Speaker 2>you would have been okay if they treated</v>

985
00:48:55.001 --> 00:48:58.610
<v Speaker 2>you well and you still found out that a </v>
<v Speaker 2>woman had been dead for six months,</v>

986
00:48:58.611 --> 00:49:00.240
<v Speaker 2>that l Ron Hubbard wasn't really a </v>
<v Speaker 2>warning,</v>

987
00:49:00.310 --> 00:49:01.060
<v Speaker 2>but I'll tell you why.</v>

988
00:49:01.090 --> 00:49:06.090
<v Speaker 2>If they had been actually disseminating </v>
<v Speaker 2>this information and people on this </v>

989
00:49:06.610 --> 00:49:09.880
<v Speaker 2>planet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're doing better and life was becoming</v>

990
00:49:09.881 --> 00:49:14.881
<v Speaker 2>better for large numbers of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I still might be there </v>

991
00:49:14.881 --> 00:49:18.840
<v Speaker 2>in other words.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you could tell he was really being </v>

992
00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:19.750
<v Speaker 2>effective in doing what you thought it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was supposed to do.</v>

993
00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:22.720
<v Speaker 2>Precisely which has helped humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Precisely.</v>

994
00:49:23.020 --> 00:49:28.020
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that at the core that its </v>
<v Speaker 2>potential to help humanity is still </v>

995
00:49:28.020 --> 00:49:28.380
<v Speaker 2>there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think that like,</v>

996
00:49:28.820 --> 00:49:31.990
<v Speaker 2>like you were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the beginning stages of scientology</v>

997
00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:37.440
<v Speaker 2>are beneficial and there was something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like if they got all these beneficial </v>

998
00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:37.670
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

999
00:49:37.810 --> 00:49:41.230
<v Speaker 2>And just offer those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the odds of that happening.</v>

1000
00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:46.680
<v Speaker 2>The odds now we're talking about would </v>
<v Speaker 2>be the same odds as me turning into a </v>

1001
00:49:48.101 --> 00:49:50.590
<v Speaker 2>penguin right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not likely to act.</v>

1002
00:49:50.591 --> 00:49:52.840
<v Speaker 2>So likely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not very likely.</v>

1003
00:49:52.841 --> 00:49:54.550
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and your son,</v>

1004
00:49:54.580 --> 00:49:56.080
<v Speaker 2>he's going to be running it forever.</v>

1005
00:49:56.080 --> 00:50:01.080
<v Speaker 2>Does he?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there is absolutely nobody was gonna </v>

1006
00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:03.401
<v Speaker 2>take over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it election like fucking election </v>

1007
00:50:03.401 --> 00:50:03.610
<v Speaker 2>needs?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He runs it and that's the end of it.</v>

1008
00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:07.300
<v Speaker 2>He's surrounded by people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess you'd call them psycho fencers.</v>

1009
00:50:07.301 --> 00:50:08.810
<v Speaker 2>Sycophants took offense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1010
00:50:08.890 --> 00:50:11.770
<v Speaker 2>Who just pump him up all the time and if</v>
<v Speaker 2>he says,</v>

1011
00:50:11.771 --> 00:50:13.260
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would like to have such and such.</v>

1012
00:50:13.780 --> 00:50:16.570
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he might want a different car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go,</v>

1013
00:50:16.571 --> 00:50:19.810
<v Speaker 2>go out and get it from one of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>people like what are the people like the</v>

1014
00:50:19.930 --> 00:50:22.810
<v Speaker 2>surround him that enabled him to </v>
<v Speaker 2>maintain this power.</v>

1015
00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:28.260
<v Speaker 2>They feel that he's a power source and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they support him a power because he's </v>

1016
00:50:28.260 --> 00:50:30.020
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He runs the organization will.</v>

1017
00:50:30.021 --> 00:50:32.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he got his tax exemption a.</v>

1018
00:50:32.661 --> 00:50:34.280
<v Speaker 2>he'll do things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's tough.</v>

1019
00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:36.380
<v Speaker 2>He's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's actually.</v>

1020
00:50:36.381 --> 00:50:41.381
<v Speaker 2>David is a very smart guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it weren't for this streak in him </v>

1021
00:50:41.381 --> 00:50:44.240
<v Speaker 2>where he obtained all this power and had</v>
<v Speaker 2>this shit going on in scientology,</v>

1022
00:50:46.110 --> 00:50:46.790
<v Speaker 2>who knows?</v>

1023
00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:49.370
<v Speaker 2>I think you could been successful at </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

1024
00:50:49.530 --> 00:50:52.040
<v Speaker 2>I believe that as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think anybody who gets to.</v>

1025
00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:57.100
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's really unfortunate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it gets to any even a position of </v>

1026
00:50:57.100 --> 00:50:59.690
<v Speaker 2>being like a drug kingpin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pablo Escobar,</v>

1027
00:50:59.750 --> 00:51:03.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure he could have been successful </v>
<v Speaker 2>at other things here.</v>

1028
00:51:03.111 --> 00:51:07.490
<v Speaker 2>I decided to focus his mind in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>direction here.</v>

1029
00:51:07.491 --> 00:51:09.020
<v Speaker 2>Exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's how I feel.</v>

1030
00:51:09.350 --> 00:51:14.350
<v Speaker 2>So you feel like your son just fucked up</v>
<v Speaker 2>in getting on a path that is in your </v>

1031
00:51:15.081 --> 00:51:20.081
<v Speaker 2>eyes illegitimate versus you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>him being the CEO of ibm or something </v>

1032
00:51:20.081 --> 00:51:24.551
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could say that you could say that </v>

1033
00:51:24.551 --> 00:51:24.551
<v Speaker 2>and I'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it would be.</v>

1034
00:51:24.551 --> 00:51:24.551
<v Speaker 2>You would be correct not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you would be.</v>

1035
00:51:24.750 --> 00:51:29.750
<v Speaker 2>Does it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever talked to him about </v>

1036
00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:29.750
<v Speaker 2>scientology that you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't bring it up.</v>

1045
00:51:50.950 --> 00:51:53.681
<v Speaker 2>at that level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are of the belief that no spiritual </v>

1047
00:51:59.810 --> 00:52:04.810
<v Speaker 2>You happen to be occupying a body that </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe was given to you by another </v>

1048
00:52:05.871 --> 00:52:10.871
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in your heart you're actually an </v>

<v Speaker 2>independent thinking life unit.</v>

1053
00:52:20.110 --> 00:52:22.340
<v Speaker 2>because everybody else is going along </v>
<v Speaker 2>with it as it deserving?</v>

1054
00:52:22.630 --> 00:52:25.850
<v Speaker 2>Is there ever a time where you're alone </v>
<v Speaker 2>with somebody else's sea org?</v>

1055

1095
00:53:56.880 --> 00:53:57.810
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

1096
00:53:58.530 --> 00:54:03.530
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't dare do that if you were at</v>
<v Speaker 2>a place like I was at the international </v>

1097

<v Speaker 2>base.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

00:54:04.291 --> 00:54:06.400
<v Speaker 2>Which is Golden Arrow productions in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hemet,</v>

1099
00:54:06.401 --> 00:54:07.140
<v Speaker 2>California.</v>

1100
00:54:07.141 --> 00:54:12.141
<v Speaker 2>What would they do to you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'd sees you and then went out and </v>

1101
00:54:12.141 --> 00:54:12.141
<v Speaker 2>you'd be sequestered from the rest of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the group,</v>

1102
00:54:12.610 --> 00:54:15.960
<v Speaker 2>put it into a place where you weren't </v>
<v Speaker 2>associated with the rest of the group.</v>

1103
00:54:16.380 --> 00:54:20.090
<v Speaker 2>You'd go to lunch at a different time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd have a security guard watching you</v>

1104
00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:21.060
<v Speaker 2>morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>afternoon,</v>

1105
00:54:21.061 --> 00:54:22.170
<v Speaker 2>and night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can never leave.</v>

1106
00:54:22.230 --> 00:54:24.300
<v Speaker 2>So I tried somebody to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if.</v>

<v Speaker 2>What if you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want to go home.</v>

1108
00:54:26.590 --> 00:54:28.780
<v Speaker 2>I want to get out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to go get an apartment to do it,</v>

1109
00:54:28.790 --> 00:54:30.060
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just can't do it.</v>

1110
00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:33.240
<v Speaker 2>So they would just keep you at </v>
<v Speaker 2>physically like,</v>

1111
00:54:33.241 --> 00:54:34.760
<v Speaker 2>hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hold you gotta,</v>

<v Speaker 2>chill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chill.</v>

1113
00:54:36.210 --> 00:54:41.210
<v Speaker 2>And if the church,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I'm sure they're going to hurt </v>

1114
00:54:41.210 --> 00:54:41.210
<v Speaker 2>dish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they can say,</v>

1115
00:54:41.210 --> 00:54:41.210
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ron could have left anytime.</v>

1116
00:54:41.210 --> 00:54:41.820
<v Speaker 2>You could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's bullshit.</v>

1117
00:54:42.390 --> 00:54:47.390
<v Speaker 2>That's complete bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I would have been caught what I was </v>

1118
00:54:47.390 --> 00:54:47.390
<v Speaker 2>trying to leave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I'm going to get into,</v>

1119
00:54:47.390 --> 00:54:47.390
<v Speaker 2>I forget.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were talking about,</v>

1120
00:54:47.390 --> 00:54:49.350
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I would have been caught,</v>

1121
00:54:50.670 --> 00:54:54.210
<v Speaker 2>they would have taken me and becky </v>
<v Speaker 2>taking the keys to my car.</v>

1122
00:54:54.630 --> 00:54:57.690
<v Speaker 2>I would've been sequestered from her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She'd been to Western for me.</v>

1123
00:54:57.960 --> 00:55:02.540
<v Speaker 2>We would have both been security checked</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit down with the hands on an emailer,</v>

1124
00:55:02.570 --> 00:55:03.840
<v Speaker 2>which I'm sure you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is your.</v>

1125
00:55:03.850 --> 00:55:05.510
<v Speaker 2>I did one of those ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1126
00:55:05.540 --> 00:55:07.890
<v Speaker 2>I don't really think it works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't think it works?</v>

1127
00:55:09.090 --> 00:55:10.440
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1128
00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:16.040
<v Speaker 2>but that's not the point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd sit down with that and be </v>

1129
00:55:16.040 --> 00:55:17.580
<v Speaker 2>interrogated and then you'd work maybe </v>
<v Speaker 2>four or five hours away.</v>

1130
00:55:17.580 --> 00:55:19.770
<v Speaker 2>It's a manual labor and when you weren't</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing that,</v>

1131
00:55:19.950 --> 00:55:22.100
<v Speaker 2>you'd be back on the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On the cans again as they say,</v>

1132
00:55:22.140 --> 00:55:23.370
<v Speaker 2>what if you don't work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if you like,</v>

1133
00:55:23.371 --> 00:55:28.371
<v Speaker 2>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to work like a difficult </v>

1134
00:55:28.371 --> 00:55:28.371
<v Speaker 2>bastard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what's ever happened?</v>

1136
00:55:28.371 --> 00:55:29.610
<v Speaker 2>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Has Anybody ever rebelled?</v>

1137
00:55:29.620 --> 00:55:31.770
<v Speaker 2>And it's human nature to rebel against </v>
<v Speaker 2>authority.</v>

1138
00:55:32.150 --> 00:55:37.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but certain amount of human nature to </v>

1139
00:55:37.150 --> 00:55:37.150
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to come.</v>

1140
00:55:37.150 --> 00:55:40.370
<v Speaker 2>But when you're up at a place where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have three or 400 people who feel </v>

1141
00:55:40.370 --> 00:55:42.300
<v Speaker 2>differently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not that brave.</v>

1142
00:55:42.460 --> 00:55:46.470
<v Speaker 2>Does anybody ever have the gumption or </v>
<v Speaker 2>the notion to go,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1145
00:55:50.850 --> 00:55:54.900
<v Speaker 2>maybe we'll know what they do is they </v>
<v Speaker 2>escape like I did.</v>

1146
00:55:55.590 --> 00:55:59.620
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't speak up for.</v>

1147
00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:01.290
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They know what they're in for.</v>

1148
00:56:01.291 --> 00:56:03.150
<v Speaker 2>Who the F here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a guy named Alex.</v>

00:56:03.390 --> 00:56:06.900
<v Speaker 2>he wanted a route out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It took them four fucking years to route</v>

1150
00:56:06.901 --> 00:56:08.050

<v Speaker 2>proper way to leave where you sit down </v>

1152
00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:15.810
<v Speaker 2>and you do this routing form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's basically security checking.</v>

1153
00:56:15.811 --> 00:56:18.540
<v Speaker 2>You kill your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>You just walk out of the fucking place </v>
<v Speaker 2>and people do that in outer org,</v>

1158
00:56:31.810 --> 00:56:35.260

<v Speaker 2>you're living in a compound.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're surrounded.</v>

1161
00:56:41.681 --> 00:56:43.760
<v Speaker 2>Would barbwire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pointing in and pointing out.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you'll really screw yourself style,</v>

1163
00:56:46.981 --> 00:56:51.981
<v Speaker 2>but if you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say if you sign a five year contract </v>

1164
00:56:51.981 --> 00:56:52.360
<v Speaker 2>when the fifth year's up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get to leave.</v>

1165
00:56:52.690 --> 00:56:57.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to try to get you to re </v>

<v Speaker 2>let's say you're working at one of the </v>

<v Speaker 2>organization Gianelli okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1169
00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:03.580
<v Speaker 2>You can walk out in the street and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1170
00:57:03.581 --> 00:57:05.170
<v Speaker 2>see you later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are they going to do?</v>

1171
00:57:05.350 --> 00:57:07.480
<v Speaker 2>Because you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in the free world.</v>

1172
00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:12.510
<v Speaker 2>You're in the free world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not running world at the </v>

1173
00:57:12.510 --> 00:57:12.510
<v Speaker 2>international base.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand.</v>

1174
00:57:12.510 --> 00:57:16.610
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you had to plot some sort of an out </v>

1175
00:57:16.610 --> 00:57:19.651
<v Speaker 2>so you to think about it and then you </v>
<v Speaker 2>had to work with the wife and you guys </v>

1176
00:57:19.651 --> 00:57:20.110
<v Speaker 2>had to like hush hush.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1177
00:57:20.111 --> 00:57:22.300
<v Speaker 2>And you asked me what led to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1178
00:57:22.301 --> 00:57:24.940
<v Speaker 2>there's one major thing that led to it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that was this.</v>

1179
00:57:25.810 --> 00:57:28.840
<v Speaker 2>We got a new music director.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to have the post anymore.</v>

1180
00:57:28.990 --> 00:57:33.990
<v Speaker 2>I was getting old and got this young guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I would write melodies all day,</v>

1181
00:57:36.850 --> 00:57:38.410
<v Speaker 2>all week months.</v>

1182
00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:42.730
<v Speaker 2>Every melody I ever wrote was rejected </v>
<v Speaker 2>by him and other words.</v>

1183
00:57:43.390 --> 00:57:45.370
<v Speaker 2>Everything I was doing was a piece of </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>

1184
00:57:46.210 --> 00:57:51.210
<v Speaker 2>but I couldn't quit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this new guy was not fun to work </v>

1185
00:57:51.210 --> 00:57:51.970
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Terrible.</v>

1186
00:57:52.210 --> 00:57:53.110
<v Speaker 2>It was terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And yet,</v>

1187
00:57:53.120 --> 00:57:58.120
<v Speaker 2>toes division,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was the only one who had gotten a </v>

1188
00:57:58.120 --> 00:58:00.030
<v Speaker 2>recording contract on my own steam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody gave it to him.</v>

1189
00:58:00.031 --> 00:58:05.031
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have a rich daddy or a contract</v>
<v Speaker 2>with chapels publishing for my writing </v>

1190
00:58:05.980 --> 00:58:10.980
<v Speaker 2>and asked to play on the BBC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody had achieved that in that </v>

1191
00:58:10.980 --> 00:58:15.330
<v Speaker 2>department.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now maybe my skills weren't up to how </v>

1192
00:58:15.330 --> 00:58:15.330
<v Speaker 2>the right modern music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I used to beg him.</v>

1193
00:58:15.330 --> 00:58:15.820
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

1194
00:58:16.120 --> 00:58:17.980
<v Speaker 2>what do you want as an acceptable </v>
<v Speaker 2>particle?</v>

1195
00:58:17.981 --> 00:58:20.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm a trained musician.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1196
00:58:20.350 --> 00:58:23.470
<v Speaker 2>let me give me some ideas what you want </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'll start writing that.</v>

1197
00:58:23.650 --> 00:58:25.510
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you learn it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like I did this.</v>

1198
00:58:25.511 --> 00:58:27.040
<v Speaker 2>I was treated well.</v>

1199
00:58:27.040 --> 00:58:29.650
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't sound like a fun time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she'll wait a minute.</v>

1200
00:58:29.660 --> 00:58:30.910
<v Speaker 2>Talk to your son and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1201
00:58:30.911 --> 00:58:33.040
<v Speaker 2>kid listens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking new guy sucks.</v>

1202
00:58:33.070 --> 00:58:33.970
<v Speaker 2>Wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did that.</v>

1203
00:58:33.971 --> 00:58:35.920
<v Speaker 2>I called him and I would assume I wrote </v>
<v Speaker 2>to him.</v>

1204
00:58:35.921 --> 00:58:36.490
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dave,</v>

1205
00:58:36.790 --> 00:58:38.570
<v Speaker 2>you got to get together with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1206
00:58:38.650 --> 00:58:40.870
<v Speaker 2>So we got together and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1207
00:58:40.871 --> 00:58:43.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm working all day long and nothing I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing is being approved.</v>

1208
00:58:44.410 --> 00:58:46.150
<v Speaker 2>You got to get me a different job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I says,</v>

1209
00:58:46.210 --> 00:58:49.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't care if you hit me a job washing</v>
<v Speaker 2>cars in multiple,</v>

1210
00:58:49.420 --> 00:58:52.480
<v Speaker 2>but I want to do something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So at the end of the day you can say,</v>

1211
00:58:52.510 --> 00:58:53.710
<v Speaker 2>here's what he did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1212
00:58:54.730 --> 00:58:55.690
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll look into it.</v>

1213
00:58:55.691 --> 00:58:57.640
<v Speaker 2>He never looked into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A couple months later,</v>

1214
00:58:57.641 --> 00:58:58.240
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Becky,</v>

1215
00:58:58.241 --> 00:58:59.590
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're getting the fuck out of here.</v>

1216
00:58:59.980 --> 00:59:04.980
<v Speaker 2>Then we started planning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what was your plan as far as like </v>

1217
00:59:04.980 --> 00:59:07.090
<v Speaker 2>getting a job because you had been </v>
<v Speaker 2>working there for 25 years?</v>

1218
00:59:07.720 --> 00:59:08.260
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a,</v>

1219
00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:12.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm a good musician.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not just a punk.</v>

1220
00:59:12.011 --> 00:59:14.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean I played quite a bit of jobs in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Milwaukee.</v>

1221
00:59:14.980 --> 00:59:18.540
<v Speaker 2>So you had skill and skills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good salesman too,</v>

1222
00:59:18.600 --> 00:59:19.830
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1223
00:59:20.170 --> 00:59:23.780
<v Speaker 2>I also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's how I look.</v>

1224
00:59:23.910 --> 00:59:26.240
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm 76 years old.</v>

1225
00:59:26.241 --> 00:59:29.430
<v Speaker 2>I'll want to spend them at rest of my </v>
<v Speaker 2>life suffering out everyday.</v>

1226
00:59:29.450 --> 00:59:32.000
<v Speaker 2>Fuck this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting Outta here.</v>

1227
00:59:32.010 --> 00:59:32.780
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got It.</v>

1228
00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:34.610
<v Speaker 2>And becky finally says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1229
00:59:34.700 --> 00:59:38.780
<v Speaker 2>And she saw the writing on the wall that</v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't going to get better.</v>

1230
00:59:39.470 --> 00:59:44.470
<v Speaker 2>So now we don't want to leave and leave </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything behind because what little </v>

1231
00:59:45.741 --> 00:59:48.610
<v Speaker 2>possessions we had was what we had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

1232
00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:52.490
<v Speaker 2>so we started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

1233
00:59:52.491 --> 00:59:57.491
<v Speaker 2>I mentioned a little earlier that my </v>
<v Speaker 2>daughter sent me 75 gifts gifts on 75th </v>

1234
00:59:57.491 --> 00:59:57.491
<v Speaker 2>birthday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1235
00:59:57.491 --> 01:00:00.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Becky came up with the idea.</v>

1236
01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:02.600
<v Speaker 2>My mother is going to celebrate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

1237
01:00:02.601 --> 01:00:03.560
<v Speaker 2>my wife is younger than me.</v>

1238
01:00:03.570 --> 01:00:08.570
<v Speaker 2>My first wife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I divorced him and married a much </v>

1239
01:00:08.570 --> 01:00:11.681
<v Speaker 2>younger woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so her mother is going to have her 70th </v>

1240
01:00:11.681 --> 01:00:15.281
<v Speaker 2>birthday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we decided to send her mother 70 </v>

1241
01:00:15.281 --> 01:00:17.120
<v Speaker 2>gifts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now in order to do this,</v>

1242
01:00:17.121 --> 01:00:22.121
<v Speaker 2>it has to go to the security guards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we would send her like a detail and </v>

1243
01:00:22.121 --> 01:00:26.921
<v Speaker 2>kid for a car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean her chances of detailing the car </v>

1244
01:00:26.921 --> 01:00:30.530
<v Speaker 2>as a gift were nil to none.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they saw that,</v>

1245
01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:32.150
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're sending her 70 gifts.</v>

1246
01:00:32.180 --> 01:00:35.060
<v Speaker 2>So it got through them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We sent her center,</v>

1247
01:00:35.100 --> 01:00:40.100
<v Speaker 2>our l,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ron Hubbard library books that we had </v>

1248
01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:43.090
<v Speaker 2>some of the things and we got a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff out of there that I couldn't fit </v>

1249
01:00:43.090 --> 01:00:44.150
<v Speaker 2>in the car when we were going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1250
01:00:44.250 --> 01:00:46.130
<v Speaker 2>you see what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Smart.</v>

1251
01:00:47.090 --> 01:00:50.450
<v Speaker 2>And then after all was said and done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got everything out of there.</v>

1252
01:00:50.451 --> 01:00:54.080
<v Speaker 2>We plotted it out and I did this on </v>
<v Speaker 2>Sunday mornings.</v>

1253
01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:57.470
<v Speaker 2>On Sunday mornings you had breakfast at </v>
<v Speaker 2>9:00.</v>

1254
01:00:58.010 --> 01:01:03.010
<v Speaker 2>Now we lived on the southern side of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>base and we lived in rooms.</v>

1255
01:01:06.410 --> 01:01:09.350
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't have a refrigerator,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you couldn't have a coffeemaker there.</v>

1256
01:01:10.070 --> 01:01:13.760
<v Speaker 2>But across the street on the north side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I worked in the studio.</v>

1257
01:01:14.030 --> 01:01:16.580
<v Speaker 2>There was a refrigerator there and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>used to keep,</v>

1258
01:01:16.581 --> 01:01:19.800
<v Speaker 2>like Italian Salami may be super sad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1259
01:01:20.060 --> 01:01:22.310
<v Speaker 2>some Parmesan cheese,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Romano cheese.</v>

1260
01:01:22.670 --> 01:01:27.670
<v Speaker 2>So early Sunday morning at 9:00.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I planned this out because there's </v>

1261
01:01:27.670 --> 01:01:32.140
<v Speaker 2>two gates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's one main gate where there's a </v>

1262
01:01:32.140 --> 01:01:34.310
<v Speaker 2>security guard sitting in a booth and in</v>
<v Speaker 2>down the road about 200 yards,</v>

1263
01:01:34.311 --> 01:01:37.700
<v Speaker 2>there's another gate where there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little camera and they see you coming.</v>

1264
01:01:38.210 --> 01:01:43.210
<v Speaker 2>And they got used to me going across to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the north side to go to the studio and </v>

1265
01:01:43.881 --> 01:01:48.410
<v Speaker 2>I'd come back to the main gate and bring</v>
<v Speaker 2>the security guards a piece of cheese or</v>

1266
01:01:48.420 --> 01:01:48.950
<v Speaker 2>Salami.</v>

1267
01:01:49.370 --> 01:01:54.370
<v Speaker 2>So they thought a Sunday morning he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to get his goodies and that it </v>

1268
01:01:54.370 --> 01:01:55.310
<v Speaker 2>wasn't feeding the watchdogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is set up,</v>

1269
01:01:55.460 --> 01:01:56.010
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1270
01:01:57.200 --> 01:02:00.020
<v Speaker 2>So it comes a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to leave March 25th,</v>

1271
01:02:00.110 --> 01:02:05.110
<v Speaker 2>2012.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We get up real early and I had a little </v>

1272
01:02:05.110 --> 01:02:06.230
<v Speaker 2>notebook.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I must have checked it 20 times.</v>

1273
01:02:06.231 --> 01:02:11.231
<v Speaker 2>What I wanted to take,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I wanted to leave behind like the </v>

1274
01:02:11.231 --> 01:02:11.231
<v Speaker 2>night before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>

1275
01:02:11.231 --> 01:02:16.211
<v Speaker 2>my biggest cover on being able to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of there was the fact that I was 76 </v>

1276
01:02:16.211 --> 01:02:18.440
<v Speaker 2>years old and I was the father of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>chairman of the board.</v>

1277
01:02:18.930 --> 01:02:23.930
<v Speaker 2>Nobody would suspect that I was going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>leave unauthorized it like alright,</v>

1278
01:02:24.090 --> 01:02:29.090
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shout them out with a mesh bag full of </v>

1279
01:02:29.090 --> 01:02:29.090
<v Speaker 2>shoes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>putting it in the car.</v>

1280
01:02:29.090 --> 01:02:33.300
<v Speaker 2>And one of the security guards come by </v>
<v Speaker 2>on his bicycle and Italian Guy Sal.</v>

1281
01:02:33.690 --> 01:02:35.070
<v Speaker 2>Hey Ronnie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how are you doing that?</v>

1282
01:02:35.070 --> 01:02:35.550
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1283
01:02:35.551 --> 01:02:38.940
<v Speaker 2>And he sees me putting this in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he justifies it in his mind.</v>

1284
01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:40.200
<v Speaker 2>He'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's putting stuff in his car.</v>

1285
01:02:40.810 --> 01:02:44.820
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't think twice why it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course another guy's coming by an old</v>

1286
01:02:44.821 --> 01:02:49.821
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>scientologist I have a bag of clothes </v>

1287
01:02:49.821 --> 01:02:49.821
<v Speaker 2>and putting in a car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ronnie.</v>

1288
01:02:49.821 --> 01:02:49.821
<v Speaker 2>How's it going?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good deal.</v>

1289
01:02:49.821 --> 01:02:50.220
<v Speaker 2>Norm?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1290
01:02:50.430 --> 01:02:51.050
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1291
01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:53.220
<v Speaker 2>put it in the car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we got through all that.</v>

1292
01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:56.010
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now Sunday morning,</v>

1293
01:02:58.140 --> 01:02:59.970
<v Speaker 2>9:00</v>
<v Speaker 2>we get in the car,</v>

1294
01:03:00.660 --> 01:03:03.750
<v Speaker 2>we're loaded up and we're driving down </v>
<v Speaker 2>to get to that.</v>

1295
01:03:03.751 --> 01:03:06.360
<v Speaker 2>Second Gate is about a half mile down </v>
<v Speaker 2>the road.</v>

1296
01:03:07.380 --> 01:03:12.380
<v Speaker 2>We go there and I'm going past our mess </v>
<v Speaker 2>hall where we would eat and this is </v>

1297
01:03:12.380 --> 01:03:16.941
<v Speaker 2>called Masco Canyon in or MCI.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's where the crew would eat their </v>

1298
01:03:16.941 --> 01:03:21.000
<v Speaker 2>meals and I see the chase car like on </v>
<v Speaker 2>Sunday morning,</v>

1299
01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:23.310
<v Speaker 2>there's only two security guards on </v>
<v Speaker 2>duty.</v>

1300
01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:28.640
<v Speaker 2>One is in the main booth and the and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>other one is in a car so he can rove and</v>

1301
01:03:29.071 --> 01:03:30.630
<v Speaker 2>it's called the chase car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1302
01:03:31.230 --> 01:03:34.110
<v Speaker 2>So the chase car is parked outside of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the mess hall.</v>

1303
01:03:34.470 --> 01:03:39.470
<v Speaker 2>I knew sal was in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I go around another hundred yards </v>

1304
01:03:39.470 --> 01:03:40.650
<v Speaker 2>down the road,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get to the gate.</v>

1305
01:03:41.190 --> 01:03:46.190
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at this point in my heart is in my </v>

1306
01:03:46.190 --> 01:03:46.190
<v Speaker 2>throat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

1307
01:03:46.190 --> 01:03:47.100
<v Speaker 2>Because if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I hit that Buzzer,</v>

1308
01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:49.910
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to have said come up to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the boot,</v>

1309
01:03:50.580 --> 01:03:51.930
<v Speaker 2>that was it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was fucked.</v>

1310
01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:53.820
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hit the buzzer.</v>

1311
01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:57.170
<v Speaker 2>Didn't say anything to gate opens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I pulled out of the gate.</v>

1312
01:03:57.200 --> 01:04:02.200
<v Speaker 2>This is becky returning left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I turned left jam to throttle and I </v>

1313
01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:04.560
<v Speaker 2>knew I had to make it them that he's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's three roads.</v>

1314
01:04:04.590 --> 01:04:07.740
<v Speaker 2>One goes to route 60,</v>
<v Speaker 2>straight ahead rather.</v>

1315
01:04:08.340 --> 01:04:10.150
<v Speaker 2>The other one goes to route 10 and if I </v>
<v Speaker 2>turn,</v>

1316
01:04:10.151 --> 01:04:15.151
<v Speaker 2>unless they go into Hamot I knew by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time I'm going down a road and he would </v>

1317
01:04:15.730 --> 01:04:17.450
<v Speaker 2>be on trying to get me into next.</v>

1318
01:04:17.450 --> 01:04:18.780
<v Speaker 2>They'll run.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the hell are you doing?</v>

1319
01:04:19.290 --> 01:04:22.170
<v Speaker 2>They need called sal and sal get up to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the booth pronto.</v>

1320
01:04:22.590 --> 01:04:24.660
<v Speaker 2>I know sal would have to run out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get in the car.</v>

1321
01:04:24.690 --> 01:04:27.570
<v Speaker 2>I'd already be at those crossroads or </v>
<v Speaker 2>the tree roads.</v>

1322
01:04:28.050 --> 01:04:33.050
<v Speaker 2>So I knew in sal came,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he needed to turn right or go straight </v>

1323
01:04:33.050 --> 01:04:33.480
<v Speaker 2>ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I turned left Winton to Hamot.</v>

1324
01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:36.390
<v Speaker 2>We hit the boondocks and I was free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1325
01:04:36.420 --> 01:04:38.730
<v Speaker 2>So when did you do then?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We drove to Wisconsin.</v>

1326
01:04:38.731 --> 01:04:39.960
<v Speaker 2>To Jeff money on you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1327
01:04:39.990 --> 01:04:42.960
<v Speaker 2>I had money on me and I paid for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I paid for everything.</v>

1328
01:04:42.961 --> 01:04:43.620
<v Speaker 2>Cash.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

1329
01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:45.810
<v Speaker 2>you only get 50 bucks a week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How long did you save money?</v>

1330
01:04:46.570 --> 01:04:48.360
<v Speaker 2>While I was also getting social </v>
<v Speaker 2>security,</v>

1331
01:04:48.361 --> 01:04:51.240
<v Speaker 2>so I would solve that away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very low amount by the way,</v>

1332
01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:53.600
<v Speaker 2>because when we didn't get much money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1333
01:04:53.650 --> 01:04:56.190
<v Speaker 2>it's just bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>

1334
01:04:56.460 --> 01:04:58.290
<v Speaker 2>I paid for gas with cash.</v>

1335
01:04:58.470 --> 01:05:01.500
<v Speaker 2>We ate for cash.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We stayed in a motel.</v>

1336
01:05:01.501 --> 01:05:06.501
<v Speaker 2>Tonight's at paid cash.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you couldn't use your credit </v>

1337
01:05:06.501 --> 01:05:06.501
<v Speaker 2>cards too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'd be able to track.</v>

1338
01:05:06.501 --> 01:05:06.501
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

1339
01:05:06.501 --> 01:05:09.990
<v Speaker 2>So when you finally surfaced hodges </v>
<v Speaker 2>surface,</v>

1340
01:05:10.410 --> 01:05:14.000
<v Speaker 2>I went to her mother's place and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens then does,</v>

1341
01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:16.080
<v Speaker 2>do they try to get you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1342
01:05:16.081 --> 01:05:17.440
<v Speaker 2>here's what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1343
01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:19.840
<v Speaker 2>believe me too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They try to bring you back,</v>

1344
01:05:19.860 --> 01:05:24.040
<v Speaker 2>you'll look big misunderstanding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or here's how it went.</v>

1345
01:05:24.070 --> 01:05:29.070
<v Speaker 2>About two weeks later we're sitting in </v>
<v Speaker 2>her mother's house and it's a split </v>

1346
01:05:29.070 --> 01:05:32.800
<v Speaker 2>level where there's an upstairs and </v>
<v Speaker 2>downstairs in the kitchen.</v>

1347
01:05:33.310 --> 01:05:35.230
<v Speaker 2>The window is almost level with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ground.</v>

1348
01:05:35.231 --> 01:05:38.290
<v Speaker 2>You know how it goes and I'm looking out</v>
<v Speaker 2>the window,</v>

1349
01:05:38.291 --> 01:05:43.291
<v Speaker 2>we're having breakfast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>coffee and I see it's girl outside </v>

1350
01:05:43.291 --> 01:05:43.870
<v Speaker 2>Marion and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck,</v>

1351
01:05:43.871 --> 01:05:44.740
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They found me,</v>

1352
01:05:45.190 --> 01:05:50.170
<v Speaker 2>so I went through the garage outside and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's craig wool hair and he says,</v>

1353
01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:55.200
<v Speaker 2>Oh Ronny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess you're surprised it took us so </v>

1354
01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:55.200
<v Speaker 2>long to get here.</v>

1355
01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:58.320
<v Speaker 2>Ha ha ha.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We thought you're going to go to </v>

1356
01:05:58.320 --> 01:05:58.320
<v Speaker 2>Laurie's place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You never thought you'd come here.</v>

1357
01:05:58.320 --> 01:05:58.660
<v Speaker 2>Ha ha ha.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like nothing happened,</v>

1358
01:05:58.661 --> 01:05:59.410
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1359
01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:01.270
<v Speaker 2>So he says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1360
01:06:01.271 --> 01:06:01.990
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1361
01:06:02.220 --> 01:06:02.830
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Greg,</v>

1362
01:06:02.831 --> 01:06:04.270
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just wasting your time.</v>

1363
01:06:04.271 --> 01:06:06.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he says,</v>

1364
01:06:06.850 --> 01:06:08.110
<v Speaker 2>Ron,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1365
01:06:08.111 --> 01:06:09.370
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to live that life,</v>

1366
01:06:09.371 --> 01:06:12.040
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a terrible fucking life.</v>

1367
01:06:12.041 --> 01:06:13.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm not doing it again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>

1368
01:06:13.361 --> 01:06:18.361
<v Speaker 2>you blue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a term they use if you leave </v>

1369
01:06:18.361 --> 01:06:19.480
<v Speaker 2>without authorization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he pulled out this policy.</v>

1370
01:06:20.820 --> 01:06:23.170
<v Speaker 2>It's called leaving and leaves and what </v>
<v Speaker 2>it says,</v>

1371
01:06:23.171 --> 01:06:27.460
<v Speaker 2>even in leaves leaving and leaves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the name of it.</v>

1372
01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:30.040
<v Speaker 2>And what it says in there substantially </v>
<v Speaker 2>is this,</v>

1373
01:06:30.910 --> 01:06:35.910
<v Speaker 2>the only reason a person leaves a group </v>
<v Speaker 2>is because they have committed harmful </v>

1374
01:06:36.611 --> 01:06:40.480
<v Speaker 2>acts against the group and they went to </v>
<v Speaker 2>remove themself.</v>

1375
01:06:40.810 --> 01:06:44.050
<v Speaker 2>So they don't keep on committing harmful</v>
<v Speaker 2>acts against the group.</v>

1376
01:06:44.170 --> 01:06:46.510
<v Speaker 2>How convenient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No Shit.</v>

1377
01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:48.160

<v Speaker 2>leave.</v>

1378
01:06:48.610 --> 01:06:51.940
<v Speaker 2>You have to be aware to the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know you're working maybe 12,</v>

1379
01:06:51.941 --> 01:06:56.941

1381
01:06:57.490 --> 01:06:59.350
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't have done it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a nice raise.</v>

1383
01:07:02.110 --> 01:07:03.190

1384
01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:06.150
<v Speaker 2>when you say you're not going back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while they try to convince me in,</v>

<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it got to the point and says,</v>

1387

<v Speaker 2>I am not going back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I went in town and I saw him a </v>

<v Speaker 2>couple times and they said,</v>

<v Speaker 2>You have a kitchen.</v>

1394
01:07:27.941 --> 01:07:30.520
<v Speaker 2>We know you like to cook and then you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can train.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You can play with the band down there.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You get me down or it's going to be the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same thing.</v>

1398
01:07:36.971 --> 01:07:37.540
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it won't.</v>

1399
01:07:37.541 --> 01:07:41.380
<v Speaker 2>Runny and went on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So do you think they were just trying to</v>

1400
01:07:41.650 --> 01:07:43.750
<v Speaker 2>bullshit you like one?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Think.</v>

1401
01:07:43.751 --> 01:07:44.710
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They.</v>

1402
01:07:44.711 --> 01:07:46.720
<v Speaker 2>So if you got there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there'd be no apartment.</v>

1403
01:07:46.721 --> 01:07:49.060
<v Speaker 2>They'd punish you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>write out a knowledge report.</v>

1404
01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:50.560
<v Speaker 2>You can't do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1405
01:07:50.870 --> 01:07:53.680
<v Speaker 2>Do they want you to stay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do they give a fuck if you leave?</v>

1406
01:07:53.990 --> 01:07:57.070
<v Speaker 2>That's what they consider to be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>sensitive particle.</v>

1407
01:07:57.580 --> 01:08:00.360
<v Speaker 2>Like these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a Paul.</v>

1408
01:08:00.370 --> 01:08:03.910
<v Speaker 2>Here's what I mean by that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Dwayne Powell and Daniel Powell,</v>

1409
01:08:04.300 --> 01:08:06.070
<v Speaker 2>while I was a father of the chairman of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the board.</v>

1410
01:08:06.070 --> 01:08:07.690
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a blight.</v>

1411
01:08:07.691 --> 01:08:12.691
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you ever talk to your son after </v>

1412
01:08:12.691 --> 01:08:12.691
<v Speaker 2>this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried to call them once.</v>

1413
01:08:12.730 --> 01:08:17.730
<v Speaker 2>I tried to call him after I found out </v>
<v Speaker 2>the pis were following me and after I </v>

1414
01:08:17.781 --> 01:08:20.660
<v Speaker 2>heard that you got on the phone and said</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he dies,</v>

1415
01:08:20.690 --> 01:08:22.010
<v Speaker 2>let him die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't intervene.</v>

1416
01:08:22.011 --> 01:08:23.690
<v Speaker 2>Don't do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what you heard,</v>

1417
01:08:23.691 --> 01:08:25.910
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can hear it to you.</v>

1418
01:08:25.930 --> 01:08:28.340
<v Speaker 2>You design according to your fingers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1419
01:08:28.341 --> 01:08:29.980
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tony Ortega,</v>

1420
01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.060
<v Speaker 2>underground bunker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can hear these interviews.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

01:08:33.110 --> 01:08:36.170
<v Speaker 2>There is public as you're going to get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't hear his actual words.</v>

1423
01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:41.480
<v Speaker 2>Know that this guy would make up that </v>
<v Speaker 2>story to make things up.</v>

1424
01:08:42.291 --> 01:08:44.300
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>While.</v>

1425
01:08:44.301 --> 01:08:45.160
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's put it this way.</v>

1426
01:08:45.161 --> 01:08:47.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm just playing devil's advocate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can play devil's advocate.</v>

1427
01:08:47.810 --> 01:08:49.670
<v Speaker 2>The father was interrogated to begin </v>
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>

1428
01:08:50.210 --> 01:08:52.580
<v Speaker 2>He told the same story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The son came in later,</v>

1429
01:08:52.790 --> 01:08:54.320
<v Speaker 2>didn't have a chance to talk to his </v>
<v Speaker 2>father.</v>

1430
01:08:54.620 --> 01:08:55.940
<v Speaker 2>Told the same story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1431
01:08:57.410 --> 01:08:59.120
<v Speaker 2>so you haven't had a chance to talk to </v>
<v Speaker 2>your son.</v>

1432
01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:03.020
<v Speaker 2>I called and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an attorney got on the phone and said,</v>

1433
01:09:03.021 --> 01:09:05.030
<v Speaker 2>Ron,</v>
<v Speaker 2>David won't talk to you.</v>

1434
01:09:05.031 --> 01:09:06.560
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't feel he can trust,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1435
01:09:06.561 --> 01:09:07.670
<v Speaker 2>Let me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me ask you this.</v>

1436
01:09:08.090 --> 01:09:10.460
<v Speaker 2>As a father,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'm a father and your father,</v>

1437
01:09:12.380 --> 01:09:17.380
<v Speaker 2>the idea of being estranged from your </v>
<v Speaker 2>kids in that way where your kid hates </v>

1438
01:09:18.201 --> 01:09:21.050
<v Speaker 2>you and your kid doesn't want anybody to</v>
<v Speaker 2>save you.</v>

1439
01:09:21.051 --> 01:09:24.590
<v Speaker 2>If you die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you feel any remorse?</v>

1440
01:09:24.591 --> 01:09:26.840
<v Speaker 2>Do you feel like in any way you fucked </v>
<v Speaker 2>up?</v>

1441
01:09:26.870 --> 01:09:29.300
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever look at your life and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how did I.</v>

1442
01:09:29.630 --> 01:09:31.970
<v Speaker 2>How did I lose my connection with my </v>
<v Speaker 2>son?</v>

1443
01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:39.760
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's written in policy to do what David </v>

1444
01:09:41.751 --> 01:09:43.060
<v Speaker 2>did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Letters,</v>

1445
01:09:43.070 --> 01:09:44.450
<v Speaker 2>a policy that says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

1446
01:09:44.451 --> 01:09:47.630
<v Speaker 2>somebody understand that entirely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm talking to you as a human being,</v>

1447
01:09:47.750 --> 01:09:49.370
<v Speaker 2>as a human being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a human being.</v>

1448
01:09:49.371 --> 01:09:51.920
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was terrible because we had</v>
<v Speaker 2>a good life together,</v>

1449
01:09:51.950 --> 01:09:56.950
<v Speaker 2>but do you feel any responsibility?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you feel like there's anything you </v>

1450
01:09:56.950 --> 01:09:57.470
<v Speaker 2>could've done differently?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you get them in scientology?</v>

1451
01:09:57.530 --> 01:10:02.530
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can I feel like once he got into </v>

1452
01:10:02.530 --> 01:10:02.530
<v Speaker 2>scientology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not your fault.</v>

1453
01:10:02.530 --> 01:10:05.240
<v Speaker 2>He lives his life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's the one who got the power to do all</v>

1454
01:10:05.241 --> 01:10:06.320
<v Speaker 2>these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand,</v>

1455
01:10:06.321 --> 01:10:07.400
<v Speaker 2>but you raised them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1456
01:10:07.430 --> 01:10:12.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever connection and bond that you </v>

1457
01:10:12.430 --> 01:10:14.450
<v Speaker 2>developed with great life together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we that didn't carry forth in some way.</v>

1458
01:10:14.750 --> 01:10:16.250
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1459
01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:20.270
<v Speaker 2>obviously I'm not in scientology and </v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously I was not in your situation,</v>

1460
01:10:20.460 --> 01:10:22.760
<v Speaker 2>but I can't imagine that you must.</v>

1461
01:10:22.790 --> 01:10:27.790
<v Speaker 2>You must have gone over it and looked at</v>
<v Speaker 2>your communications with him and </v>

1462
01:10:28.221 --> 01:10:31.610
<v Speaker 2>wondered if maybe if you extended </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself more,</v>

1463
01:10:31.670 --> 01:10:33.720
<v Speaker 2>if you talked more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it was there,</v>

1464
01:10:33.721 --> 01:10:36.380
<v Speaker 2>something you could've done that </v>
<v Speaker 2>would've prevented any of this.</v>

1465
01:10:37.250 --> 01:10:38.150
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're dreaming.</v>

1466
01:10:38.390 --> 01:10:39.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't mind telling you that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1467
01:10:40.210 --> 01:10:41.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing it with all respect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1468
01:10:41.901 --> 01:10:43.620
<v Speaker 2>Because you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1469
01:10:43.621 --> 01:10:45.710
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do good interviews.</v>

1470
01:10:45.711 --> 01:10:47.260
<v Speaker 2>I've showed you the other interviews and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1471
01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:49.460
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm happy you got me on the show.</v>

1472
01:10:49.940 --> 01:10:54.940
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't have done anything different </v>

1473
01:10:54.940 --> 01:10:54.940
<v Speaker 2>except maybe not get them in </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientology.</v>

1474
01:10:54.940 --> 01:10:56.750
<v Speaker 2>So you've got the power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>

1475
01:10:56.860 --> 01:11:01.860
<v Speaker 2>there's policy that l Ron Hubbard wrote </v>
<v Speaker 2>and David loved l Ron Hubbard,</v>

1476
01:11:02.450 --> 01:11:05.240
<v Speaker 2>and he applies the policies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We believe all that stuff.</v>

1477
01:11:05.241 --> 01:11:08.840
<v Speaker 2>Does he believe there's a politic game?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you familiar with that?</v>

1478
01:11:08.870 --> 01:11:10.490
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the fair game?</v>

1479
01:11:10.970 --> 01:11:15.970
<v Speaker 2>If somebody goes against the or talks </v>
<v Speaker 2>out against the church and they're </v>

1480
01:11:15.970 --> 01:11:19.080
<v Speaker 2>declared a suppressive person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he can be lied to.</v>

1481
01:11:19.140 --> 01:11:22.680
<v Speaker 2>Trick to and destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No punishment and the person who did it,</v>

1482
01:11:22.890 --> 01:11:27.890
<v Speaker 2>but that's not what I mean is the really</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy stuff like the stuff that sounds </v>

1483
01:11:28.921 --> 01:11:33.921
<v Speaker 2>like science fiction about like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fatals and dropping them in a volcano </v>

1484
01:11:33.921 --> 01:11:35.170
<v Speaker 2>and the hydrogen bomb and all that stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>does.</v>

1485
01:11:35.250 --> 01:11:38.750
<v Speaker 2>Does everybody believe that stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of people do believe it.</v>

1486
01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:40.360
<v Speaker 2>Is it discussed?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1487
01:11:40.380 --> 01:11:41.940
<v Speaker 2>You don't discuss that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one discusses.</v>

1488
01:11:41.941 --> 01:11:46.941
<v Speaker 2>No one discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when we're sitting around the sea </v>

1489
01:11:46.941 --> 01:11:46.941
<v Speaker 2>org,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>

1490
01:11:46.941 --> 01:11:50.331
<v Speaker 2>let's get thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get back to which pertinent to dish and </v>

1491
01:11:50.331 --> 01:11:53.000
<v Speaker 2>that's the policy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How to operate as a group that won the </v>

1492
01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:54.570
<v Speaker 2>fair game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Policy is written and by the way,</v>

1493
01:11:54.900 --> 01:11:59.900
<v Speaker 2>just to satisfy you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll send you soft copies if you need </v>

1494
01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:00.270
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's okay.</v>

1495
01:12:00.271 --> 01:12:02.460
<v Speaker 2>Here's another one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A,</v>

1496
01:12:02.461 --> 01:12:07.461
<v Speaker 2>if a person does this find or </v>
<v Speaker 2>manufacturer data about the person.</v>

1497
01:12:08.580 --> 01:12:13.580
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So once you've become their enemy kind </v>

1498
01:12:13.580 --> 01:12:13.580
<v Speaker 2>of left alone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1499
01:12:13.580 --> 01:12:14.460
<v Speaker 2>you left them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1500
01:12:14.490 --> 01:12:19.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're the dad of the chairman of the </v>

1501
01:12:19.490 --> 01:12:19.500
<v Speaker 2>board.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a sensitive particle.</v>

1502
01:12:19.501 --> 01:12:21.960
<v Speaker 2>You got a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

1503
01:12:22.020 --> 01:12:27.020
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you said they took out a bunch of </v>

1504
01:12:27.020 --> 01:12:27.020
<v Speaker 2>different website addresses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not a bunch,</v>

1505
01:12:27.020 --> 01:12:27.570
<v Speaker 2>500.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

1506
01:12:27.990 --> 01:12:31.170
<v Speaker 2>they got 500 iterations or my name </v>
<v Speaker 2>variations.</v>

1507
01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:33.450
<v Speaker 2>So no matter what you put in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

1508
01:12:33.870 --> 01:12:35.320
<v Speaker 2>I have a website,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I did.</v>

1509
01:12:35.370 --> 01:12:39.030
<v Speaker 2>I just did it and it's called the real </v>
<v Speaker 2>ron miscavige.com.</v>

1510
01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:43.980
<v Speaker 2>You could see my website,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you put any other thing in there,</v>

1511
01:12:44.220 --> 01:12:48.390
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get a hate site that </v>
<v Speaker 2>tells you things about me that you think</v>

1512
01:12:48.391 --> 01:12:51.240
<v Speaker 2>I was the worst person who ever lived.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you write this book?</v>

1513
01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:53.850
<v Speaker 2>What was the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was the motivation?</v>

1514
01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:56.460
<v Speaker 2>Did you want to make money or natural </v>
<v Speaker 2>loading?</v>

1515
01:12:56.460 --> 01:12:57.420
<v Speaker 2>Nine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to help,</v>

1516
01:12:57.450 --> 01:12:58.590
<v Speaker 2>but you didn't make money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1517
01:12:58.680 --> 01:12:59.850
<v Speaker 2>You made some money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1518
01:12:59.851 --> 01:13:01.620
<v Speaker 2>but that isn't the reason to write in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>book.</v>

1519
01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:03.960
<v Speaker 2>The reason that the only reason I'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>write a book,</v>

1520
01:13:04.350 --> 01:13:09.350
<v Speaker 2>well not me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hundreds of families that are </v>

1521
01:13:09.350 --> 01:13:12.390
<v Speaker 2>disconnected from the kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand and I knew if I.</v>

1522
01:13:12.750 --> 01:13:15.540
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what led me to write it was not even him</v>

1523
01:13:15.541 --> 01:13:17.370
<v Speaker 2>saying if he dies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let him die.</v>

1524
01:13:18.180 --> 01:13:23.180
<v Speaker 2>I then took a CD with these </v>
<v Speaker 2>interrogations on Daniel Powell and </v>

1525
01:13:25.260 --> 01:13:28.710
<v Speaker 2>Dwayne Powell and my wife and I drove </v>
<v Speaker 2>down to Florida that she,</v>

1526
01:13:28.711 --> 01:13:33.711
<v Speaker 2>my daughters and I was going to play </v>
<v Speaker 2>these for them because now they're </v>

1527
01:13:33.711 --> 01:13:35.250
<v Speaker 2>disconnected from me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I went to my daughter's daughter,</v>

1528
01:13:35.251 --> 01:13:37.620
<v Speaker 2>Laurie's place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's not home.</v>

1529
01:13:37.621 --> 01:13:39.330
<v Speaker 2>I went to denise's place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Her husband,</v>

1530
01:13:39.331 --> 01:13:40.410
<v Speaker 2>Jerry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>answered the door,</v>

1531
01:13:41.130 --> 01:13:43.200
<v Speaker 2>answer the door about that far,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's talking to me.</v>

1532
01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:43.710
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jerry,</v>

1533
01:13:43.711 --> 01:13:45.360
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to speak to denise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1534
01:13:45.361 --> 01:13:47.730
<v Speaker 2>you can't because she's not here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1535
01:13:47.731 --> 01:13:48.630
<v Speaker 2>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where is she?</v>

1536
01:13:48.650 --> 01:13:50.640
<v Speaker 2>Because I got to get in communication </v>
<v Speaker 2>with her.</v>

1537
01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:51.480
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1538
01:13:51.481 --> 01:13:53.580
<v Speaker 2>you have to go to the church and handle </v>
<v Speaker 2>it with the church.</v>

1539
01:13:53.940 --> 01:13:54.630
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jerry,</v>

1540
01:13:54.631 --> 01:13:58.320
<v Speaker 2>for Christ sake and Jerry's as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course they are.</v>

1541
01:13:58.350 --> 01:13:59.880
<v Speaker 2>If your wife's in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to be in.</v>

1542
01:13:59.881 --> 01:14:01.290
<v Speaker 2>Is that how it works?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically,</v>

1543
01:14:01.291 --> 01:14:03.120
<v Speaker 2>as you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he said,</v>

1544
01:14:03.121 --> 01:14:04.140
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to handle with them.</v>

1545
01:14:04.141 --> 01:14:07.680
<v Speaker 2>And he said it's a waste of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm talking for about 20 minutes.</v>

1546
01:14:07.681 --> 01:14:09.150
<v Speaker 2>And I finally said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jerry,</v>

1547
01:14:09.151 --> 01:14:10.290
<v Speaker 2>what's up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does this mean?</v>

1548
01:14:10.710 --> 01:14:11.130
<v Speaker 2>He's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1549
01:14:11.131 --> 01:14:15.220
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you why denise and I are </v>
<v Speaker 2>through with you and becky forever.</v>

1550
01:14:16.330 --> 01:14:18.280
<v Speaker 2>That was it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

1551
01:14:18.281 --> 01:14:23.281
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do a book and I'm going to </v>

1552
01:14:23.281 --> 01:14:25.990
<v Speaker 2>expose what you do to people because if </v>
<v Speaker 2>I did a blog,</v>

1553
01:14:26.350 --> 01:14:26.980
<v Speaker 2>who am I?</v>

1554
01:14:27.550 --> 01:14:30.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to get maybe a couple thousand</v>
<v Speaker 2>people to look at this blog,</v>

1555
01:14:30.460 --> 01:14:34.210
<v Speaker 2>but a book I knew that I could get and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was on 20 slash 20.</v>

1556
01:14:34.211 --> 01:14:37.720
<v Speaker 2>I was on the Megan Kelly show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was on late night with Seth Meyers,</v>

1557
01:14:37.930 --> 01:14:40.000
<v Speaker 2>so we got a lot of exposure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of books.</v>

1558
01:14:40.270 --> 01:14:45.270
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people are seeing what they did</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm just hoping enough people do </v>

1559
01:14:46.661 --> 01:14:51.661
<v Speaker 2>this so they're going to drop that </v>
<v Speaker 2>disconnection policy because that's a </v>

1560
01:14:51.661 --> 01:14:55.711
<v Speaker 2>killer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you think if they drop the </v>

1561
01:14:55.711 --> 01:14:57.901
<v Speaker 2>disconnection policy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe a lot of the other policies would </v>

1562
01:14:57.901 --> 01:15:01.201
<v Speaker 2>be more tolerable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if they dropped the </v>

1563
01:15:01.201 --> 01:15:02.260
<v Speaker 2>disconnection policy and allowed you to </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk to your family,</v>

1564
01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:07.320
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they wanted to do scientology and I </v>

1565
01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:08.050
<v Speaker 2>could still talk to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't give a shit.</v>

1566
01:15:08.860 --> 01:15:09.510
<v Speaker 2>I'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fine,</v>

1567
01:15:09.511 --> 01:15:11.320
<v Speaker 2>do what you want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

1568
01:15:11.380 --> 01:15:13.060
<v Speaker 2>but wouldn't it bother you that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't leave?</v>

1569
01:15:13.830 --> 01:15:18.830
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're public because they're not in </v>

1570
01:15:18.830 --> 01:15:22.140
<v Speaker 2>the car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can't really leave if you're </v>

1571
01:15:22.140 --> 01:15:22.140
<v Speaker 2>public.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1572
01:15:22.140 --> 01:15:24.130
<v Speaker 2>was Leah Remedy in the Sea Org?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1573
01:15:24.131 --> 01:15:26.590
<v Speaker 2>she's a public scientologist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when she,</v>

1574
01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:27.700
<v Speaker 2>when she left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>

1575
01:15:28.540 --> 01:15:30.550
<v Speaker 2>she took her whole family with her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1576
01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.490
<v Speaker 2>So they didn't get a chance to pick them</v>
<v Speaker 2>out and say,</v>

1577
01:15:33.491 --> 01:15:35.880
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to disconnect from lists.</v>

1578
01:15:36.310 --> 01:15:41.310
<v Speaker 2>That is like one of the things that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a hallmark operation of problematic</v>

1579
01:15:41.921 --> 01:15:42.850
<v Speaker 2>organizations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1580
01:15:42.851 --> 01:15:44.950
<v Speaker 2>They separate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>separate you from your family?</v>

1581
01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:51.000
<v Speaker 2>I think it's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the worst thing you can do </v>

1582
01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:54.151
<v Speaker 2>to a person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at them and 45 fucking years </v>

1583
01:15:54.151 --> 01:15:54.151
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1584
01:15:54.151 --> 01:15:55.450
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm 81 years old in January.</v>

1585
01:15:55.960 --> 01:15:59.130
<v Speaker 2>I would like to see my family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would like to have something,</v>

1586
01:16:00.060 --> 01:16:03.460
<v Speaker 2>just pictures of my great grandchildren </v>
<v Speaker 2>on their facebooks.</v>

1587
01:16:03.940 --> 01:16:06.880
<v Speaker 2>I've never met these kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know what their names are.</v>

1588
01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:09.010
<v Speaker 2>Son of a bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean.</v>

1589
01:16:09.340 --> 01:16:11.530
<v Speaker 2>And you feel like your kids are going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be in there forever?</v>

1590
01:16:11.880 --> 01:16:16.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They never expressed any </v>

1591
01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:17.770
<v Speaker 2>dissatisfaction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1592
01:16:18.070 --> 01:16:23.070
<v Speaker 2>when I was in the sea org,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was not around them and we only would </v>

1593
01:16:23.070 --> 01:16:26.020
<v Speaker 2>only communicate through letters or they</v>
<v Speaker 2>would send each other gifts on birthdays</v>

1594
01:16:26.021 --> 01:16:29.170
<v Speaker 2>or Christmas or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't get leaves to see them.</v>

1595
01:16:29.470 --> 01:16:33.460
<v Speaker 2>At one point my daughter Laurie went to </v>
<v Speaker 2>see David and said,</v>

1596
01:16:33.461 --> 01:16:35.260
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if dad can't come to see us,</v>

1597
01:16:35.710 --> 01:16:38.860
<v Speaker 2>we would like to go to see him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he exceeded.</v>

1598
01:16:38.861 --> 01:16:43.861
<v Speaker 2>Just imagine she had to ask him if it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>okay to come and see me and they came to</v>

1599
01:16:44.870 --> 01:16:49.210
<v Speaker 2>celebrity center and we up soon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about four days together and just having</v>

1600
01:16:49.211 --> 01:16:50.400
<v Speaker 2>a good time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me Cooking,</v>

1601
01:16:50.410 --> 01:16:55.410
<v Speaker 2>just enjoying their company and just the</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole scene is really bad.</v>

1602
01:16:56.140 --> 01:16:59.470
<v Speaker 2>It's just not okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's the way it's set up,</v>

1603
01:16:59.471 --> 01:17:03.160
<v Speaker 2>it's built into the DNA as to how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>control people.</v>

1604
01:17:03.610 --> 01:17:05.440
<v Speaker 2>And you have a threat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have extortion,</v>

1605
01:17:05.441 --> 01:17:07.120
<v Speaker 2>you have leverage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what that is.</v>

1606
01:17:07.540 --> 01:17:09.980
<v Speaker 2>That is why I wrote the book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you look back on your</v>

1607
01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:13.960
<v Speaker 1>life joining this in the 19 seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1976 70,</v>

1608
01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:17.450
<v Speaker 1>when you look back on your life and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1609
01:17:18.260 --> 01:17:23.260
<v Speaker 1>you think about that move,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that initial move of joining,</v>

1610
01:17:24.860 --> 01:17:25.910
<v Speaker 1>what goes on in your head?</v>

1611
01:17:27.860 --> 01:17:29.960
<v Speaker 2>I don't think about it because there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing I can do about it,</v>

1612
01:17:29.961 --> 01:17:32.600
<v Speaker 2>but I can tell you this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't have done it.</v>

1613
01:17:33.650 --> 01:17:36.140
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I knew then what I knew now of course</v>

1614
01:17:36.141 --> 01:17:36.580
<v Speaker 2>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1615
01:17:36.770 --> 01:17:37.400
<v Speaker 2>fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1616
01:17:37.401 --> 01:17:38.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm not doing this right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think?</v>

1617
01:17:38.921 --> 01:17:41.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did New people join all the time?</v>

1618
01:17:43.550 --> 01:17:46.430
<v Speaker 2>I can't imagine there's very many new </v>
<v Speaker 2>people joining right now.</v>

1619
01:17:46.431 --> 01:17:51.431
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless they're a shepherd or somebody </v>

1620
01:17:51.431 --> 01:17:53.771
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or somebody who's never looked at the </v>

1621
01:17:53.771 --> 01:17:53.771
<v Speaker 2>internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't possibly.</v>

1622
01:17:53.771 --> 01:17:56.420
<v Speaker 2>And this is what people do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the checks up molecule googling.</v>

1623
01:17:56.780 --> 01:18:00.200
<v Speaker 2>That's very common and you start looking</v>
<v Speaker 2>at anything.</v>

1624
01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:01.730
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do I want to get involved in this?</v>

1625
01:18:01.750 --> 01:18:03.170
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

1626
01:18:03.171 --> 01:18:08.171
<v Speaker 2>in the book I give references to books </v>
<v Speaker 2>that were written in the late 18 </v>

1627
01:18:09.951 --> 01:18:11.540
<v Speaker 2>hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>early 19 hundreds.</v>

1628
01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:15.170
<v Speaker 2>The new thought movement and there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>many,</v>

1629
01:18:15.171 --> 01:18:20.171
<v Speaker 2>many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many datums about life that if you were </v>

1630
01:18:20.171 --> 01:18:21.980
<v Speaker 2>a scientologist and you see these as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>

1631
01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:24.170
<v Speaker 2>l Ron Hubbard used to say this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

1632
01:18:24.980 --> 01:18:28.700
<v Speaker 2>talking about the reactive mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember that from dianetics.</v>

1633
01:18:29.560 --> 01:18:33.710
<v Speaker 2>When Tim Atkinson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm an amateur guys,</v>

1634
01:18:33.711 --> 01:18:37.670
<v Speaker 2>they talk about the subconscious mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It records 24 hours a day.</v>

1635
01:18:37.671 --> 01:18:39.260
<v Speaker 2>They're talking about the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was.</v>

1636
01:18:39.470 --> 01:18:41.510
<v Speaker 1>Well Lawrence where I talked about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and going clear,</v>

1637
01:18:41.511 --> 01:18:46.511
<v Speaker 1>he said that it seems like at least some</v>
<v Speaker 1>of what was going on was l Ron Hubbard </v>

1638
01:18:46.511 --> 01:18:50.480
<v Speaker 1>trying to self medicate that he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>writing things to try to cure zone ils</v>

1639
01:18:50.740 --> 01:18:51.460
<v Speaker 2>probably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1640
01:18:52.030 --> 01:18:57.030
<v Speaker 2>but these people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can go on the Internet and </v>

1641
01:18:57.030 --> 01:18:57.460
<v Speaker 2>get these books are ninety nine cents </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's past 75 years.</v>

1642
01:18:57.461 --> 01:19:02.461
<v Speaker 2>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't copyright them and of course </v>

1643
01:19:02.461 --> 01:19:03.130
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't know if you weren't a </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientologist.</v>

1644
01:19:03.131 --> 01:19:05.950
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't know which parts that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>took out of that.</v>

1645
01:19:06.430 --> 01:19:11.430
<v Speaker 2>But I've run across many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many things in the books that he just </v>

1646
01:19:11.430 --> 01:19:16.411
<v Speaker 2>lifted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost copied and pasted it and put it </v>

1647
01:19:16.411 --> 01:19:16.411
<v Speaker 2>into what he called scientology.</v>

1648
01:19:16.411 --> 01:19:18.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1649
01:19:18.650 --> 01:19:23.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean if he's trying to get a great </v>
<v Speaker 1>collection of work on how to work the </v>

1650
01:19:24.201 --> 01:19:25.520
<v Speaker 1>mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mind works</v>

1651
01:19:26.260 --> 01:19:29.470
<v Speaker 2>and it worked then so he knew it would </v>
<v Speaker 2>work now</v>

1652
01:19:29.690 --> 01:19:33.800
<v Speaker 1>and so there is something to some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the principles.</v>

1653
01:19:33.890 --> 01:19:38.890
<v Speaker 1>That's not a question about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you think to this day that if you </v>

1654
01:19:38.890 --> 01:19:39.740
<v Speaker 1>could remove a lot of it,</v>

1655
01:19:40.930 --> 01:19:45.930
<v Speaker 2>if you could filter it down to those </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that are provably work workable.</v>

1656
01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:52.570
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it's saveable do you think </v>
<v Speaker 1>like let's say this,</v>

1657
01:19:53.170 --> 01:19:56.230
<v Speaker 1>what if you know your son listens to </v>
<v Speaker 1>this podcast and he's like,</v>

1658
01:19:56.231 --> 01:19:57.320
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This light,</v>

1659
01:19:57.350 --> 01:20:00.940
<v Speaker 1>this world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows this life is not going to last</v>

1660
01:20:00.941 --> 01:20:01.990
<v Speaker 1>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What am I doing?</v>

1661
01:20:01.991 --> 01:20:04.330
<v Speaker 1>I can't even talk to my dad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well maybe I've.</v>

1662
01:20:04.750 --> 01:20:07.060
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I've lost my way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I get together with.</v>

1663
01:20:08.150 --> 01:20:09.400
<v Speaker 2>We tried to figure this out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1664
01:20:10.350 --> 01:20:12.300
<v Speaker 2>And he says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what can we do to make this better?</v>

1665
01:20:14.430 --> 01:20:17.440
<v Speaker 2>I know I'm talking crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I know I'm talking to this guy.</v>

1666
01:20:17.470 --> 01:20:19.980
<v Speaker 2>What the hell you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's just as an exercise,</v>

1667
01:20:20.010 --> 01:20:22.530
<v Speaker 2>what would you do if he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's talk it out.</v>

1668
01:20:22.580 --> 01:20:27.570
<v Speaker 2>I talked to him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll talk to anybody about anything new.</v>

1669
01:20:27.571 --> 01:20:29.730
<v Speaker 2>People are joining scientology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got a real problem.</v>

1670
01:20:29.790 --> 01:20:34.790
<v Speaker 2>What do you think is the beneficial </v>
<v Speaker 2>aspects of it that we should keep and </v>

1671
01:20:34.790 --> 01:20:37.791
<v Speaker 2>which will get rid of and I think he </v>
<v Speaker 2>would come up with the things that I </v>

1672
01:20:37.791 --> 01:20:41.301
<v Speaker 2>come up with also.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have wrote about those in this </v>

1673
01:20:41.301 --> 01:20:44.361
<v Speaker 2>book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tell about four points you could do </v>

1674
01:20:44.361 --> 01:20:47.331
<v Speaker 2>and you could sell Bj,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the chances of that happening are </v>

1675
01:20:47.331 --> 01:20:50.390
<v Speaker 2>just show remote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't bet to Shantanu will not even</v>

1676
01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:55.400
<v Speaker 2>trying to bet on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but do you think that that is just what </v>

1677
01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:55.440
<v Speaker 2>happens with people they get into these </v>
<v Speaker 2>positions?</v>

1678
01:20:55.510 --> 01:20:59.190
<v Speaker 2>We created an ideology or you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the power.</v>

1679
01:20:59.191 --> 01:21:02.670
<v Speaker 2>It's the acquisition of power and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>in order to keep that power,</v>

1680
01:21:02.671 --> 01:21:07.110
<v Speaker 2>because I think power is almost like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>drug that's almost like crack cocaine.</v>

1681
01:21:07.410 --> 01:21:09.750
<v Speaker 2>You get hooked on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to let go of it right?</v>

1682
01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:12.460
<v Speaker 2>And now you have things going to hell </v>
<v Speaker 2>around you.</v>

1683
01:21:12.780 --> 01:21:17.780
<v Speaker 2>You're going to do anything you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>perceive to be beneficial to keep it </v>

1684
01:21:17.780 --> 01:21:21.381
<v Speaker 2>going and start implementing that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>like buying new buildings and just </v>

1685
01:21:23.100 --> 01:21:28.100
<v Speaker 2>making him into these palaces for people</v>
<v Speaker 2>to come and do services and then you </v>

1686
01:21:28.100 --> 01:21:29.520
<v Speaker 2>drive by them and there's nobody in </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

1687
01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:35.480
<v Speaker 2>Nobody in them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where are they getting all the money to </v>

1688
01:21:35.480 --> 01:21:35.480
<v Speaker 2>buy these buildings?</v>
<v Speaker 2>People donate it,</v>

1689
01:21:35.480 --> 01:21:36.510
<v Speaker 2>but there's only 20,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1690
01:21:36.870 --> 01:21:38.190
<v Speaker 2>But you have whales,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1691
01:21:38.191 --> 01:21:42.300
<v Speaker 2>There are people saying call.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1692
01:21:42.301 --> 01:21:44.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm calling them a and as a matter of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fact,</v>

1693
01:21:44.291 --> 01:21:45.330
<v Speaker 2>it's like a gambling term.</v>

1694
01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:50.600
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's somebody who goes to Las Vegas and </v>

1695
01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:50.600
<v Speaker 2>they got a lot of dope and they'll blow </v>
<v Speaker 2>it all.</v>

1696
01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:51.960
<v Speaker 2>They get crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on seven,</v>

1697
01:21:52.560 --> 01:21:53.130
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1698
01:21:53.131 --> 01:21:54.480
<v Speaker 2>it's a whale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1699
01:21:54.510 --> 01:21:58.440
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you have people in there and I feel</v>

1700
01:21:58.441 --> 01:21:59.870
<v Speaker 2>no need to mention their names.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>

1701
01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:01.950
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you off the air,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but okay.</v>

1702
01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:04.500
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to throw them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a lot of very wealthy people</v>

1703
01:22:04.620 --> 01:22:06.670
<v Speaker 2>and they donate a ton of tonic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One Guy,</v>

1704
01:22:06.671 --> 01:22:09.780
<v Speaker 2>he had a medical procedure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He sold for something like two,</v>

1705
01:22:10.140 --> 01:22:12.930
<v Speaker 2>two point $4,000,000,000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>

1706
01:22:12.931 --> 01:22:17.931
<v Speaker 2>He probably gave about 50 or $60,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the church and the church would get </v>

1707
01:22:17.931 --> 01:22:22.581
<v Speaker 2>for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do they take them around and one of </v>

1708
01:22:22.581 --> 01:22:23.040
<v Speaker 2>those things like one of those old </v>
<v Speaker 2>school king things,</v>

1709
01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:26.250
<v Speaker 2>none of those things called the carry </v>
<v Speaker 2>around wells carts.</v>

1710
01:22:26.750 --> 01:22:28.770
<v Speaker 2>I don't get a bunch of dudes that cools.</v>

1711
01:22:28.980 --> 01:22:29.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1712
01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:32.010
<v Speaker 2>That'd be dope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>History of the world part one.</v>

1713
01:22:32.250 --> 01:22:33.790
<v Speaker 2>Madeline Kahn was on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1714
01:22:33.850 --> 01:22:34.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of those.</v>

1768
01:24:34.021 --> 01:24:34.330
<v Speaker 1>think he so wacky that a lot of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>movies,</v>

1769
01:24:34.331 --> 01:24:37.120
<v Speaker 1>they don't get the credit they deserve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1770
01:24:37.121 --> 01:24:39.340
<v Speaker 1>Because he's so wacky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are gross motherfucker.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's not what I'm saying.</v>

1774
01:24:45.131 --> 01:24:50.131
<v Speaker 1>What I'm saying is I think that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't respect the movie is much like </v>

1775
01:24:50.131 --> 01:24:50.770
<v Speaker 1>people that are real connoisseurs of </v>
<v Speaker 1>film.</v>

01:24:50.890 --> 01:24:55.890
<v Speaker 1>That's a fantastic science fiction </v>
<v Speaker 1>movies and which are called the edge of </v>

1777
01:24:55.890 --> 01:24:55.890
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really good.</v>

1778
01:24:56.290 --> 01:24:57.550
<v Speaker 1>Three years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe four,</v>

1779

<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1780
01:24:59.830 --> 01:25:04.830
<v Speaker 1>It's a great movie man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I feel like if someone with no </v>

1781
01:25:04.830 --> 01:25:08.281
<v Speaker 1>controversy attached to them was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>star of that movie would have been </v>

1782
01:25:08.281 --> 01:25:08.281
<v Speaker 1>critically acclaimed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

1783
01:25:08.281 --> 01:25:09.640
<v Speaker 1>it's an amazing film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have any holes in it.</v>

1784
01:25:09.970 --> 01:25:10.900
<v Speaker 1>It's a really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1785
01:25:10.901 --> 01:25:12.880
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's controversy attached to him,</v>

1786
01:25:12.881 --> 01:25:13.930
<v Speaker 1>isn't there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a little bit.</v>

1787
01:25:14.050 --> 01:25:16.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you said there wasn't,</v>

1788
01:25:16.091 --> 01:25:18.880
<v Speaker 1>you'd be Glib.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't be Glib.</v>

1789
01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:22.750
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know we worked out when he got a house</v>

1790
01:25:22.780 --> 01:25:26.950
<v Speaker 1>in Beverly Hills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put the gym in,</v>

1791
01:25:27.030 --> 01:25:29.460
<v Speaker 1>I got the equipment for the gym in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>House and uh,</v>

1792
01:25:29.590 --> 01:25:30.460
<v Speaker 1>well he's a winner.</v>

1793
01:25:30.610 --> 01:25:35.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's just a winner and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>attributes a lot of those winning </v>

1794
01:25:35.610 --> 01:25:36.310
<v Speaker 1>attitudes to scientology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1795
01:25:36.670 --> 01:25:38.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean a lot of his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1796
01:25:38.021 --> 01:25:40.210
<v Speaker 1>his focus and the way he looks at </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1797
01:25:40.420 --> 01:25:45.010
<v Speaker 1>That's what I was think of when I used </v>
<v Speaker 1>to think of before I started researching</v>

1798
01:25:45.011 --> 01:25:49.060
<v Speaker 1>it and finding all the wacky stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But before I knew what scientology was,</v>

1799
01:25:49.510 --> 01:25:53.830
<v Speaker 1>I thought of it as being like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought of dianetics right.</v>

1800
01:25:53.831 --> 01:25:57.250
<v Speaker 1>I thought dianetics was sorta like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Anthony Robbins unlimited power.</v>

1801
01:25:57.251 --> 01:25:57.910
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1802
01:25:57.911 --> 01:26:00.580
<v Speaker 1>this is like a guideline for getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>your shit together.</v>

1803
01:26:00.581 --> 01:26:05.581
<v Speaker 1>And Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what I've always wanted to </v>

1804
01:26:05.581 --> 01:26:05.581
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My whole,</v>

1805
01:26:05.581 --> 01:26:05.581
<v Speaker 1>I've always felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

1806
01:26:05.581 --> 01:26:06.470
<v Speaker 1>I wish I was more disciplined that wish </v>
<v Speaker 1>I got my shit together more.</v>

1807
01:26:06.670 --> 01:26:08.110
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I need to read more books and </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

1808
01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:10.520
<v Speaker 1>read Anthony Robbins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I read dianetics.</v>

1809
01:26:10.521 --> 01:26:13.280
<v Speaker 1>I thought they were kind of the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing back in the day.</v>

1810
01:26:13.310 --> 01:26:18.310
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anthony Robbins did steal some things </v>

1811
01:26:18.310 --> 01:26:18.310
<v Speaker 1>just from scientology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no two ways about it.</v>

1812
01:26:18.700 --> 01:26:21.560
<v Speaker 1>And there's also another thing called </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

1813
01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:24.590
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard that used in that right now.</v>

1814
01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:26.630
<v Speaker 1>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that a cult too?</v>

1815
01:26:26.970 --> 01:26:29.240
<v Speaker 1>Is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're a little bit more.</v>

1816
01:26:29.740 --> 01:26:30.490
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know to.</v>

1817
01:26:30.500 --> 01:26:35.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't know too much about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know that there are some people </v>

1818
01:26:35.500 --> 01:26:35.500
<v Speaker 1>who've done it who felt they had a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of good wins out of it.</v>

1819
01:26:35.500 --> 01:26:36.290
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the thing,</v>

1820
01:26:36.291 --> 01:26:41.291
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when you look at a guy like Tom </v>

1821
01:26:41.291 --> 01:26:41.291
<v Speaker 1>Cruise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of undeniable that that guy is</v>

1822
01:26:41.291 --> 01:26:42.230
<v Speaker 1>very successful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very driven.</v>

1823
01:26:42.231 --> 01:26:43.760
<v Speaker 1>Motivated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1824
01:26:44.330 --> 01:26:49.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But don't forget it wasn't just </v>

1825
01:26:49.330 --> 01:26:50.060
<v Speaker 1>scientology that did it for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is a talented individual.</v>

1826
01:26:50.061 --> 01:26:55.061
<v Speaker 1>I remember the first one he did about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a kid at the valley forge </v>

1827
01:26:55.061 --> 01:26:55.061
<v Speaker 1>military academy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget what it's called.</v>

1828
01:26:55.061 --> 01:26:56.540
<v Speaker 1>That taps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Taps.</v>

1829
01:26:56.560 --> 01:26:58.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I shot that at that man,</v>

1830
01:26:58.551 --> 01:27:01.490
<v Speaker 1>I liked this guy ponyboy movie too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1831
01:27:01.610 --> 01:27:05.720
<v Speaker 1>The fuck was that called outsiders?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's great actor.</v>

1832
01:27:05.910 --> 01:27:10.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he did one with Paul Newman where </v>

1833
01:27:10.910 --> 01:27:10.910
<v Speaker 1>he's a bull shark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember the color of money?</v>

1834
01:27:10.910 --> 01:27:11.750
<v Speaker 1>One of my favorite movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1835
01:27:11.751 --> 01:27:14.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's no two ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your body and individually.</v>

1836
01:27:14.770 --> 01:27:15.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I met him many times.</v>

1837
01:27:15.891 --> 01:27:18.980
<v Speaker 1>He's a nice guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let us.</v>

1838
01:27:19.070 --> 01:27:24.070
<v Speaker 1>Does he have any knowledge of all this </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff when he sees all this </v>

1839
01:27:24.070 --> 01:27:25.490
<v Speaker 1>disconnection and if he's a nice guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why does it need to step in and go,</v>

1840
01:27:25.491 --> 01:27:27.290
<v Speaker 1>hey dave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got to fucking cut this shit.</v>

1841
01:27:28.070 --> 01:27:29.660

<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine that.</v>

1842
01:27:29.661 --> 01:27:32.300
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't know about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine it.</v>

1843
01:27:32.310 --> 01:27:35.210
<v Speaker 1>And so he just like a guy like you </v>
<v Speaker 1>separated from your family.</v>

1844
01:27:35.211 --> 01:27:37.880
<v Speaker 1>It's beyond his control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's with lrap.</v>

1845
01:27:38.150 --> 01:27:40.370
<v Speaker 1>Never do anything to go against.</v>

1846
01:27:40.370 --> 01:27:41.420
<v Speaker 1>Dave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is that?</v>

1847
01:27:41.810 --> 01:27:45.530
<v Speaker 1>He continues to David to be the top </v>
<v Speaker 1>spiritual being on this planet.</v>

1848
01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:46.670
<v Speaker 1>Look at their.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saluted each other.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's Jesus.</v>

1850
01:27:49.390 --> 01:27:51.440
<v Speaker 1>That's at the event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are they in the military?</v>

1851
01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:53.210
<v Speaker 1>Pardon me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are they in the military?</v>

1852
01:27:54.080 --> 01:27:58.040
<v Speaker 1>Are they know why they knew each other?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just curious.</v>

1853
01:27:58.190 --> 01:28:01.010
<v Speaker 1>Fuck's going on and when I see you in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the morning,</v>

1854
01:28:01.090 --> 01:28:02.690
<v Speaker 1>I want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're saluting from now on.</v>

1855
01:28:02.691 --> 01:28:04.340
<v Speaker 1>We're going to salute each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck it.</v>

1856
01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:06.130
<v Speaker 1>If he could do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1857
01:28:06.290 --> 01:28:08.180
<v Speaker 1>How does that work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could anybody salute anybody?</v>

1858
01:28:08.181 --> 01:28:10.520
<v Speaker 1>Is that rude?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it like cultural appropriation?</v>

1859
01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:12.890
<v Speaker 1>Like a person walking around with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pocahontas outfit on?</v>

1860
01:28:12.950 --> 01:28:14.510
<v Speaker 1>People get mad at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1861
01:28:14.511 --> 01:28:17.550
<v Speaker 1>anybody can shoot another person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might see somebody going up from the</v>

1862
01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:18.350
<v Speaker 1>plane and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1863
01:28:18.780 --> 01:28:23.780
<v Speaker 1>have a good trip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you would do it like almost a </v>

1864
01:28:23.780 --> 01:28:23.780
<v Speaker 1>throwaway Chica.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1865
01:28:23.780 --> 01:28:23.780
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1866
01:28:23.780 --> 01:28:24.090
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fucking way you.</v>

1867
01:28:24.110 --> 01:28:25.010
<v Speaker 1>I love you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1868
01:28:25.011 --> 01:28:30.011
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sheehy organization is a military </v>

1869
01:28:30.011 --> 01:28:33.820
<v Speaker 1>type organization and you would solute </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the middle of non-ironic,</v>

1870
01:28:33.830 --> 01:28:37.160
<v Speaker 1>saluting outside of the military to </v>
<v Speaker 1>seems awful.</v>

1871
01:28:37.250 --> 01:28:38.250
<v Speaker 1>Odd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1872
01:28:38.980 --> 01:28:43.980
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well there's a lot of things John about </v>

1873
01:28:43.980 --> 01:28:47.741
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for whatever reason it kept on </v>

1874
01:28:47.741 --> 01:28:50.231
<v Speaker 1>going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And while I think that's one of the </v>

1875
01:28:50.231 --> 01:28:50.510
<v Speaker 1>reasons why that man right there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tom Cruise.</v>

1876
01:28:50.540 --> 01:28:52.190
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People look at him and go,</v>

1877
01:28:52.191 --> 01:28:53.410
<v Speaker 1>this guy's in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's a winner.</v>

1878
01:28:53.940 --> 01:28:56.910
<v Speaker 1>Well now here's what l Ron Hubbard said </v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you,</v>

1879
01:28:57.010 --> 01:29:01.740
<v Speaker 1>we should get a celebrity gin because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they are opinion leaders</v>

1880
01:29:02.280 --> 01:29:04.140
<v Speaker 2>and what do you do with an opinion </v>
<v Speaker 2>leader?</v>

1881
01:29:04.410 --> 01:29:06.600
<v Speaker 2>You want to be like that person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1882
01:29:07.170 --> 01:29:09.360
<v Speaker 2>And if an opinion leader is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientologist,</v>

1883
01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:12.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to try this out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to try what scientology was.</v>

1884
01:29:12.841 --> 01:29:16.170
<v Speaker 2>John Travolta like very nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seems like a nice guy.</v>

1885
01:29:16.830 --> 01:29:21.830
<v Speaker 2>He's literally a nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there's something those guys are </v>

1886
01:29:21.871 --> 01:29:23.460
<v Speaker 2>getting out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1887
01:29:23.461 --> 01:29:26.280
<v Speaker 2>John Travolta and Kirstie alley and </v>
<v Speaker 2>people like that.</v>

1888
01:29:26.281 --> 01:29:31.281
<v Speaker 2>They get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get auditing and they get pampered </v>

1889
01:29:31.281 --> 01:29:33.211
<v Speaker 2>and enough to follow money rules.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for them it's almost like they're a </v>

1890
01:29:33.211 --> 01:29:35.910
<v Speaker 2>part of like a gang or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're in a clinic,</v>

1891
01:29:35.940 --> 01:29:39.220
<v Speaker 2>you're in a clergy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody kisses your ass is.</v>

1892
01:29:39.310 --> 01:29:41.760
<v Speaker 2>Nobody wants to Piss you off if you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>pissed off.</v>

1893
01:29:41.761 --> 01:29:43.680
<v Speaker 2>Like Leah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well with Leah,</v>

1894
01:29:43.950 --> 01:29:48.950
<v Speaker 2>she saw she had go on and shelly was not</v>
<v Speaker 2>there with David when you were at Tom </v>

1895
01:29:48.950 --> 01:29:53.870
<v Speaker 2>Cruise's wedding and she said to Tommy </v>
<v Speaker 2>Davis where Shelly and Tommy Davis has.</v>

1896
01:29:54.720 --> 01:29:59.720
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have the fucking ranked as </v>

1897
01:29:59.720 --> 01:29:59.720
<v Speaker 2>that question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1898
01:29:59.720 --> 01:30:00.630
<v Speaker 2>you gotta get a higher rank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought that was a figure of speech.</v>

1899
01:30:01.020 --> 01:30:03.480
<v Speaker 2>That was a figure of speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he would've said,</v>

1900
01:30:03.960 --> 01:30:06.240
<v Speaker 2>look at Shelly's off doing a correction </v>
<v Speaker 2>program.</v>

1901
01:30:06.241 --> 01:30:10.260
<v Speaker 2>That's why she's not here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Leah might still be in scientology.</v>

1902
01:30:10.610 --> 01:30:12.810
<v Speaker 2>So correction program was shelly fucked </v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

1903
01:30:13.260 --> 01:30:18.260
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it and everybody in scientology </v>

1904
01:30:18.260 --> 01:30:18.390
<v Speaker 2>knows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes sea org member isn't seeing if</v>

1905
01:30:18.391 --> 01:30:18.840
<v Speaker 2>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1906
01:30:18.841 --> 01:30:20.130
<v Speaker 2>doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing a correction program.</v>

1907
01:30:20.131 --> 01:30:20.640
<v Speaker 2>They'd go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1908
01:30:20.641 --> 01:30:22.830
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That will be it.</v>

1909
01:30:22.980 --> 01:30:27.240
<v Speaker 2>So they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The mistake was they disrespected Leah.</v>

1910
01:30:28.390 --> 01:30:31.430
<v Speaker 2>She's very fiery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a little bit really fired.</v>

1911
01:30:31.740 --> 01:30:33.630
<v Speaker 2>She's from Brooklyn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's very fiery.</v>

1912
01:30:33.660 --> 01:30:35.950
<v Speaker 2>She's a great person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's.</v>

1913
01:30:36.920 --> 01:30:41.920
<v Speaker 2>You know how I met Leah hundred meter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in celebrity center in what's </v>

1914
01:30:41.920 --> 01:30:45.960
<v Speaker 2>called the president's office and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>there for some event many years ago.</v>

1915
01:30:45.990 --> 01:30:48.090
<v Speaker 2>Is there an election that.</v>

1916
01:30:48.210 --> 01:30:50.010
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how does someone get to be president?</v>

1917
01:30:50.490 --> 01:30:55.490
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just you're given the post of the </v>

1918
01:30:55.490 --> 01:30:55.490
<v Speaker 2>president of that organization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1919
01:30:55.490 --> 01:30:59.410
<v Speaker 2>It's just granted now Leah comes walking</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of this room and she said,</v>

<v Speaker 2>That was it.</v>

1945
01:31:49.460 --> 01:31:51.270
<v Speaker 2>We didn't talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She didn't talk about it.</v>

1946
01:31:51.570 --> 01:31:52.300
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1947
01:31:52.460 --> 01:31:56.310
<v Speaker 2>and the show went on no matter what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A great show.</v>

1948
01:31:56.910 --> 01:32:01.910
<v Speaker 2>I enjoy it and I watch very little TV.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a show and I could pick it up </v>

1949
01:32:01.910 --> 01:32:05.851
<v Speaker 2>anytime and watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another thing I can watch is the eagles </v>

1950
01:32:05.851 --> 01:32:06.810
<v Speaker 2>beaten the giant meltdown at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>meadowlands.</v>

1951
01:32:06.880 --> 01:32:08.230
<v Speaker 2>I don't really ever see that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1952
01:32:09.040 --> 01:32:10.570
<v Speaker 2>but eagles are down with three </v>
<v Speaker 2>touchdowns.</v>

1953
01:32:10.571 --> 01:32:12.670
<v Speaker 2>They come back and winning the last 13 </v>
<v Speaker 2>seconds.</v>

1954
01:32:13.150 --> 01:32:15.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm originally from Pennsylvania.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1955
01:32:15.521 --> 01:32:17.110
<v Speaker 2>You're reminiscing now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what's going on here?</v>

1956
01:32:18.270 --> 01:32:20.990
<v Speaker 2>A little change of pace.</v>

1957
01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.560
<v Speaker 2>You break the tension.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no tension.</v>

1958
01:32:23.590 --> 01:32:24.730
<v Speaker 2>I know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So listen,</v>

1959
01:32:24.731 --> 01:32:26.440
<v Speaker 2>Ron,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good luck with this book.</v>

1960
01:32:26.500 --> 01:32:29.290
<v Speaker 2>It's called ruthless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People can get it everywhere.</v>

1961
01:32:29.340 --> 01:32:32.860
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm an eternal optimist and I would hope</v>

1962
01:32:32.861 --> 01:32:37.861
<v Speaker 2>that one day you'd be able to speak to </v>
<v Speaker 2>your kids and one day he'd be able to </v>

1963
01:32:37.861 --> 01:32:37.960
<v Speaker 2>speak to your son and everybody could </v>
<v Speaker 2>work this out,</v>

1964
01:32:37.990 --> 01:32:42.990
<v Speaker 2>but I would hope for the same thing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess I'm starting to lose a hope on </v>

1965
01:32:45.701 --> 01:32:48.250
<v Speaker 2>that matter because it's the years are </v>
<v Speaker 2>going by now.</v>

1966
01:32:48.251 --> 01:32:53.251
<v Speaker 2>I've been out for like five years and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know what's going to change it </v>

1967
01:32:53.251 --> 01:32:56.320
<v Speaker 2>other than maybe enough people speaking </v>
<v Speaker 2>out and then dropping that disconnection</v>

1968
01:32:56.330 --> 01:32:58.270
<v Speaker 2>politic to Tom Cruise.</v>
