1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.900
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience last night set was particularly,</v>

2
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:04.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.040
<v Speaker 1>rich and ideas and some of the new things that I've been working on are,</v>

4
00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:08.874
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:10.410
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of stuff in,</v>

6
00:00:10.411 --> 00:00:15.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm worth on about this sort of a weirdness of progressive thought later,</v>

7
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.790
<v Speaker 1>like this really aggressive progressiveness that's going on where people are</v>

8
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.720
<v Speaker 1>denying reality and they're doing it so because they feel like people have been</v>

9
00:00:24.721 --> 00:00:25.950
<v Speaker 1>marginalized in the past,</v>

10
00:00:25.951 --> 00:00:26.784
<v Speaker 1>which is true,</v>

11
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.100
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't mean you spring it back the other way.</v>

12
00:00:29.101 --> 00:00:30.260
<v Speaker 1>You say bunch of stupid shit.</v>

13
00:00:30.261 --> 00:00:31.140
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make any sense.</v>

14
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:31.350
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

15
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.530
<v Speaker 1>you judge people too harshly for judging people harshly.</v>

16
00:00:33.531 --> 00:00:33.841
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

17
00:00:33.841 --> 00:00:34.200
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

18
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.040
<v Speaker 1>How does that work,</v>

19
00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:35.430
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

20
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.350
<v Speaker 1>Getting people for hitting.</v>

21
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.261
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

22
00:00:37.261 --> 00:00:37.980
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

23
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.020
<v Speaker 1>Some of the most aggressive people I know are liberals,</v>

24
00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:41.070
<v Speaker 1>so it's really strange.</v>

25
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:41.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

26
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:43.520
<v Speaker 1>there's an amazing video of,</v>

27
00:00:43.521 --> 00:00:44.790
<v Speaker 1>of University of Toronto,</v>

28
00:00:44.791 --> 00:00:49.020
<v Speaker 1>of this guy who was speaking about men's rights waterfowl.</v>

29
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

30
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:50.593
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

31
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:51.503
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

32
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.520
<v Speaker 1>These feminists are protesting these students screaming in their face.</v>

33
00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.500
<v Speaker 1>The students that want to go see this man talk about women's of,</v>

34
00:01:01.501 --> 00:01:05.760
<v Speaker 1>about men's rights and about that you hate women and all this and they're</v>

35
00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.620
<v Speaker 1>incredibly aggressive.</v>

36
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.470
<v Speaker 1>The only hate IC is in the protesters,</v>

37
00:01:09.471 --> 00:01:11.020
<v Speaker 1>the only not going be,</v>

38
00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.300
<v Speaker 1>and by the way,</v>

39
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.090
<v Speaker 1>incredibly ignorant to what this guy,</v>

40
00:01:14.091 --> 00:01:15.150
<v Speaker 1>his actual words are.</v>

41
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.280
<v Speaker 1>And they weren't even aware.</v>

42
00:01:17.281 --> 00:01:19.200
<v Speaker 1>They didn't even bother doing the research.</v>

43
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.250
<v Speaker 1>They didn't even bother formulating a true opinion on these this guy's ideas.</v>

44
00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.410
<v Speaker 1>They just decided that this guy hates women.</v>

45
00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.760
<v Speaker 1>And that's a weird thing.</v>

46
00:01:26.761 --> 00:01:31.761
<v Speaker 1>Like I've had made some posts about feminism on online before and one of the</v>

47
00:01:31.771 --> 00:01:36.420
<v Speaker 1>things that I've found it incredibly strange is that I got called an Mra</v>

48
00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:37.263
<v Speaker 1>asshole.</v>

49
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.891
<v Speaker 1>And so I go,</v>

50
00:01:37.891 --> 00:01:38.250
<v Speaker 1>what does that,</v>

51
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:38.821
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean?</v>

52
00:01:38.821 --> 00:01:39.654
<v Speaker 1>What's the Mra?</v>

53
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.250
<v Speaker 1>So that I had a very simplified English.</v>

54
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.640
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know what it meant at all.</v>

55
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.800
<v Speaker 1>It's men's rights advocate or activist.</v>

56
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:48.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

57
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.923
<v Speaker 1>we're activity.</v>

58
00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.560
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

59
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.520
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

60
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.230
<v Speaker 1>I'll feminist.</v>

61
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.680
<v Speaker 1>A person who wants equal rights for women is saying that being a man who wants</v>

62
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.310
<v Speaker 1>equal rights for men is an idiot.</v>

63
00:02:02.311 --> 00:02:05.260
<v Speaker 1>Or I could call the Dodo and Mra Dodo and like,</v>

64
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.521
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

65
00:02:05.521 --> 00:02:06.450
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

66
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:07.050
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

67
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.400
<v Speaker 1>Yoga,</v>

68
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.540
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

69
00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.400
<v Speaker 1>they had a compressive Socratic arguments.</v>

70
00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.340
<v Speaker 1>I could call it MRI asshole.</v>

71
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:12.343
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

72
00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:13.500
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even know what an MRI,</v>

73
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.681
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

74
00:02:13.681 --> 00:02:17.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm not immense rights advocate and by any stretch of the imagination,</v>

75
00:02:17.401 --> 00:02:18.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't visit any blogs.</v>

76
00:02:18.871 --> 00:02:20.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't visit any forums,</v>

77
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.430
<v Speaker 1>but I'm a believer in equality.</v>

78
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.810
<v Speaker 1>Is,</v>

79
00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.300
<v Speaker 1>is as far as like the laws and regulations as they apply to human beings.</v>

80
00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.110
<v Speaker 1>And I do not believe that the laws and regulations as they apply to human beings</v>

81
00:02:31.111 --> 00:02:34.470
<v Speaker 1>in this country aren't even for men as the art and women.</v>

82
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they're even for women and I don't think they're even for men.</v>

83
00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

84
00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:39.040
<v Speaker 1>If an area,</v>

85
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.350
<v Speaker 1>forcible laws are fucking horrendous for men and some of them are atrocious,</v>

86
00:02:43.351 --> 00:02:44.280
<v Speaker 1>some of them are Canada,</v>

87
00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:45.960
<v Speaker 1>are God awful.</v>

88
00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.030
<v Speaker 1>Dave Foley for the longest time,</v>

89
00:02:48.031 --> 00:02:48.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he's resolved.</v>

90
00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.943
<v Speaker 1>Horrible,</v>

91
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.760
<v Speaker 1>horrible.</v>

92
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.170
<v Speaker 1>Anybody who's listening to this,</v>

93
00:02:52.171 --> 00:02:53.850
<v Speaker 1>just Google Day Foley,</v>

94
00:02:53.851 --> 00:02:55.590
<v Speaker 1>Joe Experience divorce.</v>

95
00:02:55.591 --> 00:02:56.041
<v Speaker 1>And there's a,</v>

96
00:02:56.041 --> 00:03:00.250
<v Speaker 1>there's a youtube video that someone compiled of just him talks about his</v>

97
00:03:00.251 --> 00:03:00.850
<v Speaker 1>divorce.</v>

98
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.410
<v Speaker 1>He will make your head spin and,</v>

99
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.030
<v Speaker 1>and I know they'll probably be honest TV because what he lost $10 million fund</v>

100
00:03:07.031 --> 00:03:07.750
<v Speaker 1>his last divorce.</v>

101
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:08.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

102
00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.920
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

103
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:09.210
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

104
00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:10.420
<v Speaker 1>Cause he said it's not alimony.</v>

105
00:03:10.421 --> 00:03:11.254
<v Speaker 1>It's all your money.</v>

106
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:12.500
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>

107
00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.090
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

108
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.480
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

109
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.170
<v Speaker 1>It's insane.</v>

110
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.920
<v Speaker 1>It's insane.</v>

111
00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.270
<v Speaker 1>And that's not fair.</v>

112
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.051
<v Speaker 1>It's not fair.</v>

113
00:03:17.051 --> 00:03:18.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't care what anybody says.</v>

114
00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.140
<v Speaker 1>I think that absolutely.</v>

115
00:03:20.141 --> 00:03:21.780
<v Speaker 1>If a man and woman get divorced and manage,</v>

116
00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:22.600
<v Speaker 1>get child support.</v>

117
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:23.380
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

118
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.530
<v Speaker 1>And if the woman was not working during the time of the marriage,</v>

119
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:28.690
<v Speaker 1>I think there should be some sort of compensation.</v>

120
00:03:28.691 --> 00:03:29.441
<v Speaker 1>Something Fair.</v>

121
00:03:29.441 --> 00:03:30.060
<v Speaker 1>It's something recent.</v>

122
00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.211
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

123
00:03:30.211 --> 00:03:32.790
<v Speaker 2>Some of the assets that he developed by focusing on whatever.</v>

124
00:03:32.791 --> 00:03:33.001
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

125
00:03:33.001 --> 00:03:33.420
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

126
00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:34.021
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

127
00:03:34.021 --> 00:03:35.280
<v Speaker 2>But that's a terrible payments.</v>

128
00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:36.653
<v Speaker 2>That's just not right.</v>

129
00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.901
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

130
00:03:36.901 --> 00:03:37.441
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

131
00:03:37.441 --> 00:03:38.101
<v Speaker 1>It's not right.</v>

132
00:03:38.101 --> 00:03:40.770
<v Speaker 1>And I have a friend who has to pay his ex wife.</v>

133
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:41.220
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

134
00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.580
<v Speaker 1>they were,</v>

135
00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:42.810
<v Speaker 1>they were married for 12 years.</v>

136
00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.990
<v Speaker 1>He has to pay her for the rest of her life until she gets married.</v>

137
00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.160
<v Speaker 1>So she plays this game.</v>

138
00:03:47.161 --> 00:03:50.800
<v Speaker 1>She has a boyfriend and the boyfriend of her and he sends a,</v>

139
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.450
<v Speaker 1>the investigators over to figure it out and the boyfriend's not there and then</v>

140
00:03:54.451 --> 00:03:55.870
<v Speaker 1>he leaves and the,</v>

141
00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.960
<v Speaker 1>the rescuers leaving in the boyfriend moves back in.</v>

142
00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.770
<v Speaker 1>And so he has to continue paying her.</v>

143
00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.290
<v Speaker 1>Like she's cohabitating with a man and he still has to continue to send her</v>

144
00:04:04.291 --> 00:04:04.770
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

145
00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:06.450
<v Speaker 1>And it's just a manipulation of the legal system.</v>

146
00:04:06.451 --> 00:04:09.210
<v Speaker 1>And this guy has paid her millions and millions and millions of dollars.</v>

147
00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.270
<v Speaker 1>She's in his $4 million Pacific Palisades home.</v>

148
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.610
<v Speaker 1>It crippled him financially.</v>

149
00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.620
<v Speaker 1>And on top of that he had to pay for her lawyer whether they want to,</v>

150
00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.340
<v Speaker 1>it's gone through divorce and here's where it gets really crazy.</v>

151
00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.940
<v Speaker 1>She went to every lawyer in town and consulted with them,</v>

152
00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.620
<v Speaker 1>every good lawyer in town that she knew of so that he could never use them as</v>

153
00:04:28.621 --> 00:04:29.454
<v Speaker 1>counsel.</v>

154
00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.761
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

155
00:04:29.761 --> 00:04:31.150
<v Speaker 1>Because they'd be conflict of interest.</v>

156
00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.720
<v Speaker 1>But some madness.</v>

157
00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean she planned it out.</v>

158
00:04:35.551 --> 00:04:37.770
<v Speaker 1>She plans to divorce out for a long time.</v>

159
00:04:37.771 --> 00:04:42.771
<v Speaker 1>It was incredibly calculating and the idea that men don't deserve rights and</v>

160
00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.720
<v Speaker 1>because of the fact that women have been marginalized,</v>

161
00:04:45.721 --> 00:04:46.380
<v Speaker 1>which is true,</v>

162
00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:47.213
<v Speaker 1>they have been,</v>

163
00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.200
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean that men haven't been either.</v>

164
00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:49.561
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

165
00:04:49.561 --> 00:04:52.680
<v Speaker 1>human beings deserve to be treated fairly.</v>

166
00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.480
<v Speaker 1>That's just true to you.</v>

167
00:04:54.481 --> 00:04:55.290
<v Speaker 1>You deserve,</v>

168
00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.060
<v Speaker 1>everyone deserves to be treated humanely.</v>

169
00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:58.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe men are,</v>

170
00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:59.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe women are,</v>

171
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe humans are.</v>

172
00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.470
<v Speaker 1>But the idea that you could separate and be a feminist,</v>

173
00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.300
<v Speaker 1>but the anti men's rights,</v>

174
00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.601
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

175
00:05:06.601 --> 00:05:08.340
<v Speaker 1>you're a fucking crazy person then.</v>

176
00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.791
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

177
00:05:08.791 --> 00:05:10.140
<v Speaker 1>you're not a humanist.</v>

178
00:05:10.141 --> 00:05:13.020
<v Speaker 1>You're not a person who's looking at all human beings as your brothers and</v>

179
00:05:13.021 --> 00:05:13.854
<v Speaker 1>sisters.</v>

180
00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.330
<v Speaker 1>You're a person with that agenda.</v>

181
00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:17.850
<v Speaker 1>You're a a person with an ideology.</v>

182
00:05:17.851 --> 00:05:19.620
<v Speaker 1>And that ideology is that you're on a team,</v>

183
00:05:19.621 --> 00:05:21.990
<v Speaker 1>you're on team vagina and everything that's on TV.</v>

184
00:05:21.991 --> 00:05:23.160
<v Speaker 1>Penis can go fuck itself.</v>

185
00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.061
<v Speaker 1>And that was the,</v>

186
00:05:24.061 --> 00:05:24.531
<v Speaker 1>that was the,</v>

187
00:05:24.531 --> 00:05:25.470
<v Speaker 1>the feedback.</v>

188
00:05:25.471 --> 00:05:29.460
<v Speaker 1>The blow back that I got for a joke about male feminists.</v>

189
00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:30.011
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

190
00:05:30.011 --> 00:05:30.161
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

191
00:05:30.161 --> 00:05:33.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've stepped on that landmine a couple of times and I keep going back to</v>

192
00:05:33.221 --> 00:05:33.820
<v Speaker 2>it cause it is,</v>

193
00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:34.870
<v Speaker 2>it is an important one.</v>

194
00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:36.490
<v Speaker 2>A young man in the legal system.</v>

195
00:05:36.491 --> 00:05:39.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean not just with divorce but I mean the sentencing disparities between men</v>

196
00:05:39.551 --> 00:05:39.851
<v Speaker 2>and women,</v>

197
00:05:39.851 --> 00:05:40.980
<v Speaker 2>what they call the Pussy Bass,</v>

198
00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

199
00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:42.031
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

200
00:05:42.031 --> 00:05:42.641
<v Speaker 2>it's horrendous.</v>

201
00:05:42.641 --> 00:05:46.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean you call Feminism Marxists with Penny's socialism,</v>

202
00:05:46.451 --> 00:05:46.961
<v Speaker 2>socialism,</v>

203
00:05:46.961 --> 00:05:47.531
<v Speaker 2>the original prop,</v>

204
00:05:47.531 --> 00:05:48.610
<v Speaker 2>the socialism with tests.</v>

205
00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:51.730
<v Speaker 2>But that was a bad character and one of my novels,</v>

206
00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:53.410
<v Speaker 2>but I just call it the feminism.</v>

207
00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.710
<v Speaker 2>Socialism is Panisse and it's very true because I mean,</v>

208
00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:57.710
<v Speaker 2>and then people call,</v>

209
00:05:57.711 --> 00:05:58.191
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

210
00:05:58.191 --> 00:05:58.791
<v Speaker 2>that's so terrible.</v>

211
00:05:58.791 --> 00:05:59.090
<v Speaker 2>Design.</v>

212
00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:02.390
<v Speaker 2>I just went through all the founding matriarchs of the feminist system that all</v>

213
00:06:02.391 --> 00:06:02.931
<v Speaker 2>Marxists,</v>

214
00:06:02.931 --> 00:06:04.310
<v Speaker 2>all leftist and so on.</v>

215
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:07.100
<v Speaker 2>And also if feminism is so pro woman,</v>

216
00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.680
<v Speaker 2>then where are they with Margaret Thatcher?</v>

217
00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:12.920
<v Speaker 2>Margaret Thatcher was like the first leader of a Western country.</v>

218
00:06:12.921 --> 00:06:14.420
<v Speaker 2>She struggled that from nothing.</v>

219
00:06:14.421 --> 00:06:16.040
<v Speaker 2>I made an incredibly powerful woman,</v>

220
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:17.150
<v Speaker 2>but she was on the right,</v>

221
00:06:17.151 --> 00:06:17.451
<v Speaker 2>you see,</v>

222
00:06:17.451 --> 00:06:18.290
<v Speaker 2>so they hate her.</v>

223
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:19.400
<v Speaker 2>What about Iran?</v>

224
00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:19.850
<v Speaker 2>I ran,</v>

225
00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:20.210
<v Speaker 2>wrote,</v>

226
00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:24.410
<v Speaker 2>wrote the most influential book outside the Bible and the second most</v>

227
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:28.670
<v Speaker 2>influential book in according to The New York Times review of books after the</v>

228
00:06:28.671 --> 00:06:29.330
<v Speaker 2>Bible,</v>

229
00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:29.540
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

230
00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:29.781
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

231
00:06:29.781 --> 00:06:34.310
<v Speaker 2>reshaped a western philosophy in many ways and western politics and the feminist</v>

232
00:06:34.311 --> 00:06:34.551
<v Speaker 2>hater.</v>

233
00:06:34.551 --> 00:06:34.761
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

234
00:06:34.761 --> 00:06:36.190
<v Speaker 2>Cause she was on the right cause he's,</v>

235
00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:36.861
<v Speaker 2>that's what they think.</v>

236
00:06:36.861 --> 00:06:40.730
<v Speaker 2>She was not actually on the right but so I mean I have these sort of suspicions</v>

237
00:06:40.731 --> 00:06:42.070
<v Speaker 2>when they're sort of the,</v>

238
00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.810
<v Speaker 2>is it the leftist ideology or the pro woman?</v>

239
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:47.810
<v Speaker 2>Now if it's the pro woman then they should be incredibly positive.</v>

240
00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:52.100
<v Speaker 2>Where are the feminists when people insult people like and culture.</v>

241
00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:54.390
<v Speaker 2>Where are the feminists when people insult Sarah Palin,</v>

242
00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:55.311
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

243
00:06:55.311 --> 00:06:55.941
<v Speaker 2>like Bill Maher,</v>

244
00:06:55.941 --> 00:06:56.840
<v Speaker 2>her called her a cunt.</v>

245
00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:59.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's really pretty vicious.</v>

246
00:06:59.361 --> 00:07:00.111
<v Speaker 2>Like publicly,</v>

247
00:07:00.111 --> 00:07:00.561
<v Speaker 2>openly,</v>

248
00:07:00.561 --> 00:07:00.831
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

249
00:07:00.831 --> 00:07:04.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean where are the fee because they're on the right and culture are considered</v>

250
00:07:04.701 --> 00:07:05.241
<v Speaker 2>to be on the right.</v>

251
00:07:05.241 --> 00:07:07.130
<v Speaker 2>So they get a pass when people go,</v>

252
00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:07.431
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

253
00:07:07.431 --> 00:07:09.740
<v Speaker 2>but you then say something bad about a woman on the left.</v>

254
00:07:09.741 --> 00:07:13.670
<v Speaker 2>And so I think that it is more left than it is pro women because when they</v>

255
00:07:13.671 --> 00:07:15.920
<v Speaker 2>choose between their politics and the agenda,</v>

256
00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:18.260
<v Speaker 2>they always seem to choose the politics over the agenda.</v>

257
00:07:18.261 --> 00:07:20.840
<v Speaker 2>And that's why I say it's leftist rather than than pro woman.</v>

258
00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:21.831
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

259
00:07:21.831 --> 00:07:26.710
<v Speaker 1>And I think there's a lot of really emotional and non objective thinking</v>

260
00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:28.660
<v Speaker 1>attached to feminism and there's a lot of,</v>

261
00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:30.430
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of really strange.</v>

262
00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:31.770
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

263
00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:31.951
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

264
00:07:31.951 --> 00:07:32.110
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

265
00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:35.590
<v Speaker 1>one of the more recent ones that I find incredibly strange is this,</v>

266
00:07:35.591 --> 00:07:35.771
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

267
00:07:35.771 --> 00:07:40.090
<v Speaker 1>there's this new trend of accusing men of rape if they have sex with a woman</v>

268
00:07:40.091 --> 00:07:41.050
<v Speaker 1>who's had something to drink.</v>

269
00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:42.160
<v Speaker 1>This is a,</v>

270
00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:42.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

271
00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:42.820
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

272
00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:46.630
<v Speaker 1>a broad sweeping thing that's going through the Internet.</v>

273
00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:47.730
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of these,</v>

274
00:07:47.731 --> 00:07:48.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

275
00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:50.440
<v Speaker 1>it's really weird because it seems to be,</v>

276
00:07:50.441 --> 00:07:51.350
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of it in this,</v>

277
00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:53.200
<v Speaker 1>what they call a skeptical community.</v>

278
00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:54.440
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

279
00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:58.480
<v Speaker 1>the skeptical community seems to be of like integrated with a lot of male</v>

280
00:07:58.481 --> 00:08:03.010
<v Speaker 1>feminists and feminist and this is something that they've adopted this idea that</v>

281
00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.680
<v Speaker 1>somehow or another skepticism and this idea,</v>

282
00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:06.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

283
00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:06.571
<v Speaker 1>that they,</v>

284
00:08:06.571 --> 00:08:07.420
<v Speaker 1>that they combine.</v>

285
00:08:07.421 --> 00:08:08.680
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

286
00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:10.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you're aware of of the case,</v>

287
00:08:10.631 --> 00:08:11.680
<v Speaker 1>the Michael Shermer thing,</v>

288
00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:13.000
<v Speaker 1>you know about all that accused,</v>

289
00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:13.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

290
00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:15.370
<v Speaker 1>some significant sexual impropriety,</v>

291
00:08:15.371 --> 00:08:15.560
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

292
00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:16.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

293
00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:21.090
<v Speaker 1>No evidence other than a person who doesn't want to reveal their name.</v>

294
00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:21.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

295
00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:21.621
<v Speaker 1>Who,</v>

296
00:08:21.621 --> 00:08:21.970
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

297
00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:24.660
<v Speaker 1>the guy who wrote the piece heard about second hand.</v>

298
00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:25.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

299
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.890
<v Speaker 1>He didn't even hear about it directly from the person.</v>

300
00:08:26.891 --> 00:08:28.440
<v Speaker 1>And this is the person who's supposed to spell it.</v>

301
00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:29.283
<v Speaker 1>They not see,</v>

302
00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:30.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand is,</v>

303
00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:32.290
<v Speaker 1>and he is getting sued now,</v>

304
00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:35.620
<v Speaker 1>but it's the idea of that being the skeptic community.</v>

305
00:08:35.621 --> 00:08:36.011
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

306
00:08:36.011 --> 00:08:40.360
<v Speaker 1>one of the things you learn as a skeptic when you're breaking down any idea,</v>

307
00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:44.200
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a religious idea or whether it's an idea about,</v>

308
00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:44.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

309
00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:49.450
<v Speaker 1>an event that took place is that a person's eye witness account of any</v>

310
00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:51.820
<v Speaker 1>individual event is suspect.</v>

311
00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.280
<v Speaker 1>And that it's one of the worst forms of,</v>

312
00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:55.383
<v Speaker 1>of evidence.</v>

313
00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:58.290
<v Speaker 1>And it doesn't mean that a terrible thing didn't happen with this person,</v>

314
00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.390
<v Speaker 1>but it does mean that if you look at the,</v>

315
00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:05.420
<v Speaker 1>in the context of the way it was explained in this guy's blog is that she was</v>

316
00:09:05.581 --> 00:09:07.860
<v Speaker 1>put in a position where she couldn't consent.</v>

317
00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:09.091
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

318
00:09:09.091 --> 00:09:11.610
<v Speaker 1>What kind of Weirdo language is that?</v>

319
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:12.940
<v Speaker 1>And then the,</v>

320
00:09:12.941 --> 00:09:17.220
<v Speaker 1>the corroborating evidence that he uses in this blog is that a woman went to a</v>

321
00:09:17.221 --> 00:09:22.221
<v Speaker 1>party with this guy and he kept giving her drinks and he was flirting and that</v>

322
00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:24.120
<v Speaker 1>she got drunker than she usually does.</v>

323
00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:25.290
<v Speaker 1>And that's it.</v>

324
00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:29.610
<v Speaker 1>That's the corroborating piece of evidence that the man and a woman who are both</v>

325
00:09:29.611 --> 00:09:32.640
<v Speaker 1>adults were drinking together and she got drunk.</v>

326
00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:33.503
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

327
00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:34.393
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

328
00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:39.030
<v Speaker 1>you talk about removing yourself a personal responsibility that he,</v>

329
00:09:39.031 --> 00:09:42.060
<v Speaker 1>this guy was responsible for you getting drunker.</v>

330
00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:43.500
<v Speaker 1>Like that's insane.</v>

331
00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:47.190
<v Speaker 1>Like that's insane for a person to say this and we'll be drinks.</v>

332
00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:49.590
<v Speaker 1>What choice did I am feminist?</v>

333
00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:50.041
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

334
00:09:50.041 --> 00:09:50.760
<v Speaker 1>why would you,</v>

335
00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:54.090
<v Speaker 1>how is it possible that a person who believes in the,</v>

336
00:09:54.091 --> 00:09:59.091
<v Speaker 1>in the power of being a woman could think that a woman is so much weaker than a</v>

337
00:09:59.611 --> 00:10:00.270
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

338
00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:03.690
<v Speaker 1>that she can't control how much liquor she consumes when she's around a man?</v>

339
00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:07.740
<v Speaker 1>If the man somehow or another like being with her and drinking with her forces</v>

340
00:10:07.741 --> 00:10:09.630
<v Speaker 1>her to consume more than she normally would,</v>

341
00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:13.290
<v Speaker 1>that's madness and there's no excuse called I was drunk.</v>

342
00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:15.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean try that with drunk driving,</v>

343
00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:15.450
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

344
00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:16.380
<v Speaker 1>It's all points that,</v>

345
00:10:16.381 --> 00:10:16.860
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

346
00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:17.221
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

347
00:10:17.221 --> 00:10:19.020
<v Speaker 1>you had diminished capacity while you were driving,</v>

348
00:10:19.021 --> 00:10:21.000
<v Speaker 1>but you were responsible for drinking and getting in the car.</v>

349
00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:25.080
<v Speaker 1>It's the one time when we're willing to alleviate someone of their own personal</v>

350
00:10:25.081 --> 00:10:26.820
<v Speaker 1>responsibility and only women.</v>

351
00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:31.870
<v Speaker 1>A man is more a man who if a man and man is more responsible if a man of women</v>

352
00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:32.910
<v Speaker 1>or drunk together,</v>

353
00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:36.300
<v Speaker 1>but the woman feels bad about the encounter in the morning,</v>

354
00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:37.163
<v Speaker 1>the man raped,</v>

355
00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:38.940
<v Speaker 1>maybe all the man was drunk as well,</v>

356
00:10:38.941 --> 00:10:42.000
<v Speaker 1>but the men are always the aggressors and always therefore guilty.</v>

357
00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:44.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's not humanism,</v>

358
00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:45.570
<v Speaker 1>but that has taken,</v>

359
00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:47.880
<v Speaker 1>and this is a long dock road,</v>

360
00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:48.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

361
00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:50.130
<v Speaker 1>that as a man and you know,</v>

362
00:10:50.131 --> 00:10:51.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry that if you're a woman,</v>

363
00:10:51.271 --> 00:10:52.560
<v Speaker 1>it's really hard to get this.</v>

364
00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:57.540
<v Speaker 1>We have had so much negativity over the past 40 or so years,</v>

365
00:10:57.550 --> 00:11:00.060
<v Speaker 1>pearls and masculinity that,</v>

366
00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:00.421
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

367
00:11:00.421 --> 00:11:02.280
<v Speaker 1>we were like half criminals just for breathing.</v>

368
00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:02.821
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

369
00:11:02.821 --> 00:11:03.531
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the,</v>

370
00:11:03.531 --> 00:11:04.830
<v Speaker 1>the role models on TV,</v>

371
00:11:04.831 --> 00:11:05.220
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

372
00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:06.370
<v Speaker 1>how men to portray,</v>

373
00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:06.601
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

374
00:11:06.601 --> 00:11:08.700
<v Speaker 1>the homeless Simpsons and the American Dads,</v>

375
00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:15.020
<v Speaker 1>they deck would all just idiots and sex trace and irresponsible and stupid at</v>

376
00:11:15.721 --> 00:11:19.920
<v Speaker 1>the amazing thing is that it's true that if you look at the belcove intelligence</v>

377
00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:20.850
<v Speaker 1>for women,</v>

378
00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:25.200
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of spikes in the middle of so many more women are average intelligence</v>

379
00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:26.063
<v Speaker 1>than men.</v>

380
00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:27.570
<v Speaker 1>Now you still have your brilliant women,</v>

381
00:11:27.571 --> 00:11:28.510
<v Speaker 1>you still have your done with it.</v>

382
00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:31.410
<v Speaker 1>But if you look at the bell curve of male intelligence is much flatter,</v>

383
00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:34.890
<v Speaker 1>which means that we have a lot more geniuses and allot my complete idiots,</v>

384
00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:35.611
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

385
00:11:35.611 --> 00:11:38.520
<v Speaker 1>And what's happening is everybody's focused on the idiots among them.</v>

386
00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:42.420
<v Speaker 1>And if completely began to ignore all the brilliance that men bring to the</v>

387
00:11:42.421 --> 00:11:42.720
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

388
00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:43.501
<v Speaker 1>all of the amazing,</v>

389
00:11:43.501 --> 00:11:45.570
<v Speaker 1>incredible inventions that men bring to the world.</v>

390
00:11:45.571 --> 00:11:47.550
<v Speaker 1>And it's just with focusing on this low cluster,</v>

391
00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:49.260
<v Speaker 1>which is incredibly biased.</v>

392
00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:50.071
<v Speaker 1>It's like saying,</v>

393
00:11:50.071 --> 00:11:50.341
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

394
00:11:50.341 --> 00:11:51.270
<v Speaker 1>well blacks in America,</v>

395
00:11:51.271 --> 00:11:54.100
<v Speaker 1>they commit more crimes and we're just gonna focus on that and say that's</v>

396
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:54.801
<v Speaker 2>all the blacks are.</v>

397
00:11:54.801 --> 00:11:56.170
<v Speaker 2>That's all we're going to portray as blacks,</v>

398
00:11:56.171 --> 00:11:56.861
<v Speaker 2>as criminals and blah,</v>

399
00:11:56.861 --> 00:11:56.951
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

400
00:11:56.951 --> 00:11:57.061
<v Speaker 2>blah.</v>

401
00:11:57.061 --> 00:11:58.330
<v Speaker 2>That would be incredibly racist.</v>

402
00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:01.810
<v Speaker 2>But the sexism of portraying men as idiots because we happen to have more</v>

403
00:12:01.811 --> 00:12:05.710
<v Speaker 2>cluster as a gender on that side and completely ignoring all of the incredible</v>

404
00:12:05.711 --> 00:12:07.570
<v Speaker 2>stuff that brilliant men bring to the world.</v>

405
00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:10.240
<v Speaker 2>It's incredibly sexist and it's really hard for,</v>

406
00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.490
<v Speaker 2>for for people to see.</v>

407
00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:14.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean like the idea that the,</v>

408
00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:15.281
<v Speaker 2>we were talking earlier,</v>

409
00:12:15.281 --> 00:12:18.430
<v Speaker 2>the idea that a woman can competently raise children without a man around.</v>

410
00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:19.840
<v Speaker 2>It's just taken for granted.</v>

411
00:12:19.841 --> 00:12:20.260
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

412
00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.770
<v Speaker 2>it's absolutely not true matter of essential to the healthy raising of children,</v>

413
00:12:23.771 --> 00:12:26.890
<v Speaker 2>but the idea that we would recognize that as a society,</v>

414
00:12:26.891 --> 00:12:28.390
<v Speaker 2>it's just we were just the disposable,</v>

415
00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:32.000
<v Speaker 1>very unfortunate situation.</v>

416
00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:34.100
<v Speaker 1>We're in in regards to feminism that uh,</v>

417
00:12:34.101 --> 00:12:38.330
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people are dealing with their own personal experiences that they've had</v>

418
00:12:38.331 --> 00:12:42.410
<v Speaker 1>with a few asshole men in their lives in regards to them not being sexually</v>

419
00:12:42.411 --> 00:12:45.320
<v Speaker 1>attractive or not fitting into a certain social group or not.</v>

420
00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:49.640
<v Speaker 1>And then they have somehow or another extrapolated that that all men are pieces</v>

421
00:12:49.641 --> 00:12:53.960
<v Speaker 1>of shit and rapists or a massive amount of need to be curved and laws need to be</v>

422
00:12:53.961 --> 00:12:54.411
<v Speaker 1>changed.</v>

423
00:12:54.411 --> 00:12:57.380
<v Speaker 1>And if you get drunk with a girl and you have sex with her,</v>

424
00:12:57.381 --> 00:12:58.190
<v Speaker 1>you're a rapist.</v>

425
00:12:58.190 --> 00:12:58.710
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

426
00:12:58.710 --> 00:13:03.650
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of this is based on their own negative interactions with men.</v>

427
00:13:03.651 --> 00:13:08.030
<v Speaker 1>And this stereotype of feminism unfortunately is like,</v>

428
00:13:08.031 --> 00:13:09.440
<v Speaker 1>there's a meme online,</v>

429
00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:12.260
<v Speaker 1>this is feminism and it's a woman who,</v>

430
00:13:12.261 --> 00:13:12.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

431
00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:13.101
<v Speaker 1>has a,</v>

432
00:13:13.101 --> 00:13:13.580
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

433
00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:13.941
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

434
00:13:13.941 --> 00:13:14.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

435
00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:14.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

436
00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:15.250
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

437
00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:15.610
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

438
00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:19.670
<v Speaker 1>of holding up a sign saying I'm a feminist and she's fucking 300 pounds.</v>

439
00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:20.863
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

440
00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:21.770
<v Speaker 1>and everyone's like,</v>

441
00:13:21.771 --> 00:13:22.130
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

442
00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:22.940
<v Speaker 1>that's feminism.</v>

443
00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:23.251
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

444
00:13:23.251 --> 00:13:23.750
<v Speaker 1>like this is,</v>

445
00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:23.901
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

446
00:13:23.901 --> 00:13:24.291
<v Speaker 1>you're right,</v>

447
00:13:24.291 --> 00:13:26.060
<v Speaker 1>it's a big fat are going to go that no one's a fuck.</v>

448
00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:27.680
<v Speaker 1>That's really unfortunate.</v>

449
00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:29.300
<v Speaker 1>But the person,</v>

450
00:13:29.301 --> 00:13:31.550
<v Speaker 1>the type of person that is a large,</v>

451
00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:34.600
<v Speaker 1>unattractive woman is going to deal with and uh,</v>

452
00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:35.960
<v Speaker 1>in measurably,</v>

453
00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:38.850
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be so much harder for,</v>

454
00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:41.990
<v Speaker 1>for her to find people who are sexually attracted to her,</v>

455
00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:45.370
<v Speaker 1>for her to find a healthy relationships for her too.</v>

456
00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:45.860
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>

457
00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:50.420
<v Speaker 1>it's an unfortunate reality in this world is that if you are not sexually</v>

458
00:13:50.421 --> 00:13:51.230
<v Speaker 1>attractive,</v>

459
00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:52.460
<v Speaker 1>you are not going to have,</v>

460
00:13:52.461 --> 00:13:54.530
<v Speaker 1>is easier to ride when it comes to the opposite sex.</v>

461
00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:55.393
<v Speaker 1>It's just a fact.</v>

462
00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:56.541
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

463
00:13:56.541 --> 00:13:56.811
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

464
00:13:56.811 --> 00:13:58.580
<v Speaker 2>but sexually attractive and 300 pounds,</v>

465
00:13:58.700 --> 00:13:59.001
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

466
00:13:59.001 --> 00:14:00.050
<v Speaker 2>somebody who's 300 pounds,</v>

467
00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:02.810
<v Speaker 2>he is for most people got gotta be sexually unattractive.</v>

468
00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:05.720
<v Speaker 2>But if they chose to lose weight and exercise,</v>

469
00:14:05.721 --> 00:14:06.770
<v Speaker 2>that's sort of a different matter.</v>

470
00:14:06.771 --> 00:14:08.810
<v Speaker 2>And that's just kind of have a basic human competence.</v>

471
00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:10.360
<v Speaker 2>But one of the things that I hadn't thought of it,</v>

472
00:14:10.361 --> 00:14:11.194
<v Speaker 2>like I grew up with a,</v>

473
00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:14.780
<v Speaker 2>a single mom and we lived because single moms are used to be broke,</v>

474
00:14:14.781 --> 00:14:14.991
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

475
00:14:14.991 --> 00:14:15.201
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

476
00:14:15.201 --> 00:14:16.370
<v Speaker 2>because it's a tough life.</v>

477
00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:18.260
<v Speaker 2>And so when I grew up with a single mom,</v>

478
00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:20.000
<v Speaker 2>everyone around me has single moms as well.</v>

479
00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:20.490
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

480
00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:25.490
<v Speaker 2>what's interesting is that the kind of man who float through single mom world,</v>

481
00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:28.040
<v Speaker 2>they're not always the best kind of men,</v>

482
00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:28.551
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

483
00:14:28.551 --> 00:14:29.301
<v Speaker 2>They kind of trashy,</v>

484
00:14:29.301 --> 00:14:29.541
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

485
00:14:29.541 --> 00:14:33.260
<v Speaker 2>Because like the really competent and successful and intelligent men aren't</v>

486
00:14:33.261 --> 00:14:35.810
<v Speaker 2>trawling the girlfriend farms at the single mom.</v>

487
00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:36.261
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

488
00:14:36.261 --> 00:14:37.360
<v Speaker 2>they'll rent housing getups.</v>

489
00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:38.120
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

490
00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:42.260
<v Speaker 2>And so I think what happens is a lot of these women have grown up in single mom</v>

491
00:14:42.261 --> 00:14:42.931
<v Speaker 2>households or,</v>

492
00:14:42.931 --> 00:14:46.400
<v Speaker 2>or in this sort of environment and see who the men who floating through that,</v>

493
00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:47.690
<v Speaker 2>they tend to kind of be losers.</v>

494
00:14:47.691 --> 00:14:49.130
<v Speaker 2>They tend to be pretty unstable.</v>

495
00:14:49.131 --> 00:14:51.140
<v Speaker 2>They tend to be kind of parasitical.</v>

496
00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:51.291
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

497
00:14:51.291 --> 00:14:51.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

498
00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:52.820
<v Speaker 2>they don't tend to be very,</v>

499
00:14:52.821 --> 00:14:54.050
<v Speaker 2>the very best specimens of,</v>

500
00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:55.070
<v Speaker 2>of masculinity.</v>

501
00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:56.940
<v Speaker 2>And so I think the breakdown of the family,</v>

502
00:14:56.941 --> 00:15:00.230
<v Speaker 2>he has created an environment where a lot of girls growing up don't have a</v>

503
00:15:00.231 --> 00:15:01.850
<v Speaker 2>positive male role model in their life.</v>

504
00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:04.310
<v Speaker 2>And the kind of men that they see floating through their moms,</v>

505
00:15:04.311 --> 00:15:05.720
<v Speaker 2>dads tend to be kind of trashy.</v>

506
00:15:05.721 --> 00:15:06.171
<v Speaker 2>So they're like,</v>

507
00:15:06.171 --> 00:15:06.291
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

508
00:15:06.291 --> 00:15:07.130
<v Speaker 2>this is masculinity.</v>

509
00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:10.150
<v Speaker 1>It's also very unfortunate that in their criticism of masculinity,</v>

510
00:15:10.151 --> 00:15:12.310
<v Speaker 1>you've removed a lot of allies,</v>

511
00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:13.031
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

512
00:15:13.031 --> 00:15:15.640
<v Speaker 1>but by blanket generalizations of men,</v>

513
00:15:15.641 --> 00:15:20.350
<v Speaker 1>you removed a lot of people like myself who I can't support you on that even</v>

514
00:15:20.351 --> 00:15:23.870
<v Speaker 1>though I'm an entirely approach human being and,</v>

515
00:15:23.871 --> 00:15:25.240
<v Speaker 1>and pro equality.</v>

516
00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:29.080
<v Speaker 1>But when you make these mass generalizations and call someone a men's rights</v>

517
00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:31.090
<v Speaker 1>advocate asshole like that,</v>

518
00:15:31.091 --> 00:15:31.361
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

519
00:15:31.361 --> 00:15:32.860
<v Speaker 1>these are nonsense statements.</v>

520
00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:35.590
<v Speaker 1>And it's unfortunate that I guarantee you these,</v>

521
00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:37.300
<v Speaker 1>and it's not saying that all feminists,</v>

522
00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:41.260
<v Speaker 1>feminists or unattractive or all feminists or uh,</v>

523
00:15:41.261 --> 00:15:41.661
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

524
00:15:41.661 --> 00:15:41.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

525
00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:42.081
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

526
00:15:42.081 --> 00:15:42.400
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

527
00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:43.570
<v Speaker 1>not sexually viable,</v>

528
00:15:43.571 --> 00:15:46.780
<v Speaker 1>but I guarantee you almost all of them,</v>

529
00:15:46.781 --> 00:15:48.730
<v Speaker 1>I've had a lot of negative experiences with men.</v>

530
00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:51.100
<v Speaker 1>And it doesn't mean that all men are negative.</v>

531
00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:56.200
<v Speaker 1>And it doesn't mean that there's not people out there that you would assume</v>

532
00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:57.190
<v Speaker 1>would be assholes,</v>

533
00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:58.570
<v Speaker 1>are actually very nice people.</v>

534
00:15:58.840 --> 00:15:59.680
<v Speaker 1>But you've got this,</v>

535
00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:00.820
<v Speaker 1>this idea that's,</v>

536
00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:04.810
<v Speaker 1>it's easier to define the world by these rigid dimensions that you've sort of</v>

537
00:16:04.811 --> 00:16:05.710
<v Speaker 1>set up for yourself.</v>

538
00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:07.040
<v Speaker 1>And when,</v>

539
00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:07.900
<v Speaker 1>when I,</v>

540
00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:11.950
<v Speaker 1>when I read things that are from this feminist point of view,</v>

541
00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:15.070
<v Speaker 1>there's so often aggressive and it's so often,</v>

542
00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:16.670
<v Speaker 1>and I get that there's a blowback.</v>

543
00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:17.681
<v Speaker 1>I do get that.</v>

544
00:16:17.681 --> 00:16:20.050
<v Speaker 1>I get that they've experienced marginalization.</v>

545
00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:21.420
<v Speaker 1>They believed that,</v>

546
00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:21.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

547
00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:26.610
<v Speaker 1>society is set up to support rape culture and all these strange ideas and that</v>

548
00:16:26.621 --> 00:16:27.760
<v Speaker 1>there's a blow back to it.</v>

549
00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.610
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think that the way it's being handled is,</v>

550
00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:31.773
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>

551
00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:32.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's objective.</v>

552
00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:36.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's irrational and I don't think it's balanced.</v>

553
00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:36.851
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

554
00:16:36.851 --> 00:16:37.150
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

555
00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:37.690
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

556
00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:42.490
<v Speaker 1>I find it really weird when really intelligent people attach themselves to these</v>

557
00:16:42.491 --> 00:16:43.570
<v Speaker 1>feminist ideas.</v>

558
00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:45.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

559
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:45.221
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

560
00:16:45.221 --> 00:16:45.570
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

561
00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:46.560
<v Speaker 2>but the problem is,</v>

562
00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:47.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

563
00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:49.680
<v Speaker 2>in Canada here I had a guy on my show,</v>

564
00:16:49.681 --> 00:16:51.060
<v Speaker 2>Greg can't bill Gehringer who wrote,</v>

565
00:16:51.061 --> 00:16:51.510
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

566
00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:51.900
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

567
00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:52.830
<v Speaker 2>at the end of the family.</v>

568
00:16:52.831 --> 00:16:53.664
<v Speaker 2>And it was,</v>

569
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.270
<v Speaker 2>and he pointed out that there's a revolution that occurs.</v>

570
00:16:57.271 --> 00:16:59.160
<v Speaker 2>I think that initially it's necessary.</v>

571
00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:01.270
<v Speaker 2>And I think this is also with blacks in America too.</v>

572
00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:03.690
<v Speaker 2>There's a revolution that occurs then is initially necessary,</v>

573
00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:07.830
<v Speaker 2>but the whole point of a revolution is to defend itself to end,</v>

574
00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:08.671
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

575
00:17:08.671 --> 00:17:09.181
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

576
00:17:09.181 --> 00:17:10.710
<v Speaker 2>I mean there was stuff that needed to be done.</v>

577
00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:11.820
<v Speaker 2>Obviously we've talked about the,</v>

578
00:17:11.821 --> 00:17:15.330
<v Speaker 2>certainly the blacks and the 60s and some stuff with women's kind of different,</v>

579
00:17:15.331 --> 00:17:15.541
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

580
00:17:15.541 --> 00:17:16.141
<v Speaker 2>So cause women,</v>

581
00:17:16.141 --> 00:17:17.700
<v Speaker 2>there's always been this women and children first,</v>

582
00:17:17.701 --> 00:17:17.901
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

583
00:17:17.901 --> 00:17:20.280
<v Speaker 2>Like the vast majority of the people who died on the titanic,</v>

584
00:17:20.281 --> 00:17:22.890
<v Speaker 2>we're men offering up their lifeboats to women,</v>

585
00:17:22.891 --> 00:17:23.100
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

586
00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:24.930
<v Speaker 2>Because there has been a sort of women and children first,</v>

587
00:17:24.931 --> 00:17:26.190
<v Speaker 2>and women have been kind of elevated.</v>

588
00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:29.180
<v Speaker 2>There was no black people for us in the south right there.</v>

589
00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:30.240
<v Speaker 2>So it's a little bit different.</v>

590
00:17:30.241 --> 00:17:31.260
<v Speaker 2>But there was,</v>

591
00:17:31.261 --> 00:17:31.561
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

592
00:17:31.561 --> 00:17:33.660
<v Speaker 2>some push for quality that needed to happen.</v>

593
00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:37.080
<v Speaker 2>But then what happens is you get a lot of people who get heavily invested in</v>

594
00:17:37.081 --> 00:17:38.850
<v Speaker 2>this course and they'd be,</v>

595
00:17:38.851 --> 00:17:39.670
<v Speaker 2>becomes their ego,</v>

596
00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:40.503
<v Speaker 2>their identity,</v>

597
00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:40.801
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

598
00:17:40.801 --> 00:17:41.940
<v Speaker 2>Like I fight for black lives,</v>

599
00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:43.320
<v Speaker 2>I fight for women's rights and so on.</v>

600
00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:47.610
<v Speaker 2>But then what happens is society will often listen and respond in a positive</v>

601
00:17:47.611 --> 00:17:48.360
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

602
00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:51.330
<v Speaker 2>and then what is that course begins to diminish?</v>

603
00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:52.490
<v Speaker 2>And people are like,</v>

604
00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:52.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

605
00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:53.251
<v Speaker 2>supporting,</v>

606
00:17:53.251 --> 00:17:53.431
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

607
00:17:53.431 --> 00:17:56.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to support you the abolitionists course because slavery is ended.</v>

608
00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:57.360
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm just not going to do with it.</v>

609
00:17:57.361 --> 00:17:57.721
<v Speaker 2>It's over.</v>

610
00:17:57.721 --> 00:17:57.901
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

611
00:17:57.901 --> 00:17:58.081
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

612
00:17:58.081 --> 00:17:59.040
<v Speaker 2>there may be other problems,</v>

613
00:17:59.041 --> 00:18:00.330
<v Speaker 2>but that's not the problem.</v>

614
00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:01.130
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

615
00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:03.150
<v Speaker 2>Like I know to support a lot of,</v>

616
00:18:03.151 --> 00:18:03.390
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

617
00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:03.621
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

618
00:18:03.621 --> 00:18:03.900
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>

619
00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:06.570
<v Speaker 2>let's deal with polio victims because we've got this vaccine and we don't really</v>

620
00:18:06.571 --> 00:18:07.590
<v Speaker 2>have polio victims anymore.</v>

621
00:18:07.591 --> 00:18:07.771
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

622
00:18:07.771 --> 00:18:10.410
<v Speaker 2>So the whole point of revolution is to defund itself,</v>

623
00:18:10.411 --> 00:18:12.390
<v Speaker 2>to end for people to move on with their lives.</v>

624
00:18:12.670 --> 00:18:14.490
<v Speaker 2>But what happens is when you haven't government,</v>

625
00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:16.710
<v Speaker 2>you get these voting blocks and you get,</v>

626
00:18:16.711 --> 00:18:17.610
<v Speaker 2>like in Canada,</v>

627
00:18:17.611 --> 00:18:19.050
<v Speaker 2>over the last 10 or 15 years,</v>

628
00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:22.230
<v Speaker 2>Katie government's given $300 million to feminist groups.</v>

629
00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:25.470
<v Speaker 2>That's not coming from Canadian women or Canadian men for that matter,</v>

630
00:18:25.471 --> 00:18:26.150
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>

631
00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:26.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

632
00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:27.660
<v Speaker 2>a lot of it's kind of been dealt with.</v>

633
00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:31.710
<v Speaker 2>But these groups continue by by poking these scams and by continuing these</v>

634
00:18:31.711 --> 00:18:35.340
<v Speaker 2>grievances and by finding the Trayvon Martin situation and blowing it up into a</v>

635
00:18:35.341 --> 00:18:36.810
<v Speaker 2>race war and all this kind of stuff.</v>

636
00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:38.580
<v Speaker 2>A lot of the stuff has been dealt with,</v>

637
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.070
<v Speaker 2>but because the government's still getting the money,</v>

638
00:18:41.071 --> 00:18:44.220
<v Speaker 2>they still need to whip up these kinds of hysteria there just to justify their</v>

639
00:18:44.221 --> 00:18:44.791
<v Speaker 2>own existence.</v>

640
00:18:44.791 --> 00:18:45.270
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

641
00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:49.110
<v Speaker 2>the whole point of a revolution is to end the whole point of I want to deal with</v>

642
00:18:49.111 --> 00:18:49.540
<v Speaker 2>measles.</v>

643
00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:51.240
<v Speaker 2>It's get a vaccine and end measles.</v>

644
00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:53.670
<v Speaker 2>You don't keep taking the same amount of money that year after year,</v>

645
00:18:53.671 --> 00:18:54.960
<v Speaker 2>but if you have a government funding it,</v>

646
00:18:54.961 --> 00:18:56.640
<v Speaker 2>then you have to manufacture these grievances,</v>

647
00:18:56.641 --> 00:18:58.440
<v Speaker 2>which just keeps things going and getting worse.</v>

648
00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:02.800
<v Speaker 1>The point of revolution has a resolution and resolution never seems to come</v>

649
00:19:02.801 --> 00:19:03.060
<v Speaker 1>play.</v>

650
00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:08.060
<v Speaker 1>It's never going to take place if you're approaches imbalanced and there's just</v>

651
00:19:09.161 --> 00:19:14.161
<v Speaker 1>some things that are being some proponents of feminism or endorsing one of them</v>

652
00:19:14.711 --> 00:19:17.350
<v Speaker 1>being the ability to withdraw consent equals rape.</v>

653
00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:19.450
<v Speaker 1>The ability that you mean after the fact?</v>

654
00:19:19.451 --> 00:19:19.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

655
00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:20.351
<v Speaker 1>after the fact.</v>

656
00:19:20.351 --> 00:19:20.531
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

657
00:19:20.531 --> 00:19:22.770
<v Speaker 1>That's sending you can send it to you.</v>

658
00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:25.890
<v Speaker 2>That's like me giving you my coffee and then judging you with theft when you</v>

659
00:19:25.891 --> 00:19:26.700
<v Speaker 2>walk out the room.</v>

660
00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:26.851
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

661
00:19:26.851 --> 00:19:27.684
<v Speaker 2>take my coffee.</v>

662
00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:28.021
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

663
00:19:28.021 --> 00:19:30.690
<v Speaker 2>officer that he stole my coffee because I changed my mind after the fact when he</v>

664
00:19:30.691 --> 00:19:30.960
<v Speaker 2>left.</v>

665
00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:31.141
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

666
00:19:31.141 --> 00:19:35.130
<v Speaker 1>the idea is that a man can lie to a woman in order to get in bed with her and</v>

667
00:19:35.131 --> 00:19:37.190
<v Speaker 1>then if she can prove that he did that,</v>

668
00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:40.380
<v Speaker 1>but that he's a rapist because he tricked her with his words.</v>

669
00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:40.651
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

670
00:19:40.651 --> 00:19:41.930
<v Speaker 2>because of course women never lie.</v>

671
00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:42.331
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

672
00:19:42.331 --> 00:19:43.170
<v Speaker 2>they don't use makeup.</v>

673
00:19:43.171 --> 00:19:44.550
<v Speaker 2>They don't puff up their tits.</v>

674
00:19:44.551 --> 00:19:45.384
<v Speaker 2>They don't ever</v>

675
00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:46.830
<v Speaker 1>falsify any therapy.</v>

676
00:19:46.831 --> 00:19:49.680
<v Speaker 1>You don't do anything like a man because he's wealthy and hope to get pregnant</v>

677
00:19:49.681 --> 00:19:50.170
<v Speaker 1>with him either.</v>

678
00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:50.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

679
00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:53.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't see any feminists that are decrying that and that's a,</v>

680
00:19:53.011 --> 00:19:54.990
<v Speaker 1>that's a horrible front to womanhood.</v>

681
00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:58.290
<v Speaker 1>I think that the only way that you could make a live in is to lie to a man and</v>

682
00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:01.460
<v Speaker 1>make him get you pregnant so that you can get money from them.</v>

683
00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:02.011
<v Speaker 1>From then on.</v>

684
00:20:02.011 --> 00:20:02.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

685
00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:03.530
<v Speaker 1>we're feminist.</v>

686
00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:05.970
<v Speaker 1>True feminists should be horrified by that,</v>

687
00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:07.151
<v Speaker 2>which I'll focus on.</v>

688
00:20:07.151 --> 00:20:08.350
<v Speaker 2>The false rape accusations,</v>

689
00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:10.330
<v Speaker 2>false rape accusations,</v>

690
00:20:10.331 --> 00:20:14.710
<v Speaker 2>which in some studies or 2030 or 40% of the study in the air force,</v>

691
00:20:14.890 --> 00:20:15.641
<v Speaker 2>but they actually do,</v>

692
00:20:15.641 --> 00:20:17.920
<v Speaker 2>even women who have withdrawn their accusations,</v>

693
00:20:17.921 --> 00:20:21.160
<v Speaker 2>2030 or 40% of Rick Rick accusations in some studies,</v>

694
00:20:21.161 --> 00:20:23.790
<v Speaker 2>who knows what it is universally are our fast.</v>

695
00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:27.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean how horrendous that and women should be coming down so hard.</v>

696
00:20:27.161 --> 00:20:30.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm wondering who make false rape accusations cause they make it so much harder</v>

697
00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:31.720
<v Speaker 2>for the women who actually happened,</v>

698
00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:31.991
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

699
00:20:31.991 --> 00:20:34.180
<v Speaker 2>Because then there's that problem or a false paternity.</v>

700
00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:37.520
<v Speaker 2>And the problem with fall three prepositions are very few women fees face</v>

701
00:20:37.521 --> 00:20:38.440
<v Speaker 2>repercussions for them.</v>

702
00:20:38.441 --> 00:20:38.611
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

703
00:20:38.611 --> 00:20:39.610
<v Speaker 2>Am I in my book?</v>

704
00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:40.630
<v Speaker 2>If you can,</v>

705
00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:42.760
<v Speaker 2>if you accuse someone of a crime and you lied,</v>

706
00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:43.630
<v Speaker 2>you get the punishment,</v>

707
00:20:43.631 --> 00:20:44.410
<v Speaker 2>they would have gotten,</v>

708
00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:45.650
<v Speaker 2>you should</v>

709
00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:48.070
<v Speaker 2>player football</v>

710
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:49.540
<v Speaker 1>player who has recently been released,</v>

711
00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:50.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

712
00:20:50.090 --> 00:20:51.400
<v Speaker 1>that he got on tape,</v>

713
00:20:51.401 --> 00:20:56.200
<v Speaker 1>this girl a admitting that she lied about him being him raping her and her</v>

714
00:20:56.201 --> 00:21:00.970
<v Speaker 1>family received $1 million or $850,000 and now they,</v>

715
00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:01.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

716
00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:02.620
<v Speaker 1>they have to pay the money back.</v>

717
00:21:02.621 --> 00:21:04.060
<v Speaker 1>But that's the extent of her punishment.</v>

718
00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:06.100
<v Speaker 1>This guy went to jail for five fucking years,</v>

719
00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:06.761
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

720
00:21:06.761 --> 00:21:11.140
<v Speaker 1>and now he's just trying to re pursue recording and he'd still be there.</v>

721
00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:11.321
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

722
00:21:11.321 --> 00:21:11.891
<v Speaker 1>not only that,</v>

723
00:21:11.891 --> 00:21:13.150
<v Speaker 1>he's just one of many.</v>

724
00:21:13.151 --> 00:21:15.850
<v Speaker 1>I have three friends that were falsely accused of rape.</v>

725
00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:17.710
<v Speaker 1>I also have friends that were raped.</v>

726
00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:18.940
<v Speaker 1>I know that there's,</v>

727
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:19.960
<v Speaker 1>I know rape is real.</v>

728
00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:20.590
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

729
00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:22.810
<v Speaker 1>I have friends that have been roofing and you know,</v>

730
00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:25.480
<v Speaker 1>got out of danger because someone recognized in been drug.</v>

731
00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:25.840
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

732
00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:26.860
<v Speaker 1>it's very common.</v>

733
00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:27.371
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

734
00:21:27.371 --> 00:21:28.810
<v Speaker 1>rape is a disgusting,</v>

735
00:21:28.811 --> 00:21:31.330
<v Speaker 1>horrible anti human crime.</v>

736
00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:32.341
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

737
00:21:32.341 --> 00:21:33.161
<v Speaker 1>I think rape is,</v>

738
00:21:33.161 --> 00:21:34.810
<v Speaker 1>should be treated the same way as murderers.</v>

739
00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:35.290
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

740
00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:37.030
<v Speaker 1>you're denying someone their humanity.</v>

741
00:21:37.031 --> 00:21:37.481
<v Speaker 1>You're doing,</v>

742
00:21:37.481 --> 00:21:39.190
<v Speaker 1>you're taking away something,</v>

743
00:21:39.191 --> 00:21:40.120
<v Speaker 1>some part of them,</v>

744
00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:43.750
<v Speaker 1>you're removing a part of the w the who they are as a person.</v>

745
00:21:43.751 --> 00:21:44.584
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of permanent.</v>

746
00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:44.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

747
00:21:44.890 --> 00:21:46.840
<v Speaker 1>Somebody you can get a new car,</v>

748
00:21:46.841 --> 00:21:49.780
<v Speaker 1>but there's something about sexual violations that it's kind of a permanent</v>

749
00:21:49.781 --> 00:21:49.891
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

750
00:21:49.891 --> 00:21:50.724
<v Speaker 1>It's horrible,</v>

751
00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:53.020
<v Speaker 1>but so is lying about it.</v>

752
00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:54.730
<v Speaker 1>That's horrible to lying about.</v>

753
00:21:54.731 --> 00:21:56.110
<v Speaker 1>A rape is just as hard a lot of it,</v>

754
00:21:56.111 --> 00:21:56.861
<v Speaker 1>but often we get them in,</v>

755
00:21:56.861 --> 00:21:57.430
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

756
00:21:57.430 --> 00:21:58.240
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

757
00:21:58.240 --> 00:21:58.631
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

758
00:21:58.631 --> 00:22:03.040
<v Speaker 1>And this idea of this idea of withdrawing consent,</v>

759
00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:03.851
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

760
00:22:03.851 --> 00:22:06.700
<v Speaker 1>and it's somehow or another you could do that and turn a guy into a rapist</v>

761
00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:09.100
<v Speaker 1>that's like hating thing that's uh,</v>

762
00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:09.650
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>

763
00:22:09.650 --> 00:22:09.900
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

764
00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:10.241
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

00:22:10.241 --> 00:22:10.530
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

766
00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:11.560
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing is you're,</v>

767
00:22:11.561 --> 00:22:11.891
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

768
00:22:11.891 --> 00:22:12.191
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

769
00:22:12.191 --> 00:22:14.230
<v Speaker 1>you're hating someone who's manipulative.</v>

770
00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:17.290
<v Speaker 1>You're hating someone who can con you into bed.</v>

771
00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:22.470
<v Speaker 1>But that's been what men have been trying to do since the beginning of time.</v>

772
00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:25.990
<v Speaker 1>Like you're eating of the game of courting a woman.</v>

774
00:22:30.281 --> 00:22:31.120
<v Speaker 1>would never buy.</v>

775
00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:31.811
<v Speaker 1>And cars.</v>

776
00:22:31.811 --> 00:22:35.590
<v Speaker 1>They don't give a shit about an apartment that they decorate just to get the</v>

777
00:22:35.591 --> 00:22:37.300
<v Speaker 1>woman to believe that they're like this.</v>

778
00:22:37.301 --> 00:22:38.460
<v Speaker 1>It's all a alive.</v>

779

787
00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:49.901
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

788

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:53.593
<v Speaker 2>Anthony,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm a predator.</v>

791
00:22:56.231 --> 00:22:57.300
<v Speaker 2>So I come over his house and like,</v>

796
00:23:01.241 --> 00:23:01.841
<v Speaker 2>So I saw that.</v>

00:23:01.841 --> 00:23:02.320
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

798
00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:03.430
<v Speaker 2>you're not fucking reading that.</v>

799
00:23:03.431 --> 00:23:03.611

800
00:23:03.611 --> 00:23:03.931
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

801
00:23:03.931 --> 00:23:05.560
<v Speaker 2>you're hoping a chick comes over.</v>

802
00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:07.090
<v Speaker 2>And she sees that and she's like,</v>

803
00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:07.411

805
00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:11.140
<v Speaker 2>He started laughing.</v>

806
00:23:11.141 --> 00:23:11.381
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

807

<v Speaker 2>it's true.</v>

808
00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:13.331
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>

809
00:23:13.331 --> 00:23:15.850
<v Speaker 2>I decorate my house to pretend I'm smarter than I am.</v>

810
00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:16.421
<v Speaker 2>I did that.</v>

811
00:23:16.421 --> 00:23:18.010
<v Speaker 2>There was a Stephen Hawking's book,</v>

812
00:23:18.011 --> 00:23:19.600
<v Speaker 2>a brief history of time or by the upper right.</v>

00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:22.001
<v Speaker 2>This woman,</v>

815

<v Speaker 2>I loved her to death.</v>

816
00:23:22.961 --> 00:23:23.681
<v Speaker 2>We went out for a while.</v>

817
00:23:23.681 --> 00:23:24.970
<v Speaker 2>This woman came over and she's like,</v>
