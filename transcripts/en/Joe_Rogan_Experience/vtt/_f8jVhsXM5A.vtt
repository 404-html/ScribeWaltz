<v Speaker 1>Chug this rosie first.</v>

12
00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:29.143
<v Speaker 1>What does that even mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just in one of those barrels and </v>

13
00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.000
<v Speaker 1>barrel to what?</v>

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've Ribeiro that fucking shotgun.</v>

15
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.900
<v Speaker 1>I've listened to the Jimi Hendrix live </v>
<v Speaker 1>machine gun,</v>

16
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.780
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's God damn.</v>

17
00:00:45.781 --> 00:00:46.614
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one of those songs where </v>

18
00:00:47.491 --> 00:00:51.180
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you hear it and you just go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh wow.</v>

19
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.043
<v Speaker 1>Like I've met.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe been missing out on how good this </v>

20
00:00:53.971 --> 00:00:58.570
<v Speaker 1>fucking song is there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's conjuring shit up out.</v>

21
00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.830
<v Speaker 1>It's just so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have that band of Gypsies record.</v>

22
00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:05.581
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

23
00:01:05.581 --> 00:01:07.980
<v Speaker 1>It's all live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I almost just stopped myself from saying</v>

24
00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.823
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I realized where we were just </v>

25
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:10.533
<v Speaker 1>thinking radio show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have we ever thought that one up on the </v>

26
00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.570
<v Speaker 1>radio and the censored radio?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

27
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.870
<v Speaker 1>but there's this song called a power of </v>
<v Speaker 1>love,</v>

28
00:01:21.871 --> 00:01:22.990
<v Speaker 1>so I just wanna keep talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy.</v>

29
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.350
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean all this stuff's in saint,</v>

30
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.193
<v Speaker 1>but there's this tone that he hits that </v>
<v Speaker 1>just like carves a piece out of your </v>

31
00:01:33.331 --> 00:01:35.760
<v Speaker 1>soul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I used to work with Phil Hartman,</v>

32
00:01:35.761 --> 00:01:36.594
<v Speaker 1>he told me a story about when he was at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the whiskey and I think he was a </v>

33
00:01:40.921 --> 00:01:41.754
<v Speaker 1>teenager,</v>
<v Speaker 1>still think phil was like 18 or 19 or </v>

34
00:01:43.861 --> 00:01:44.694
<v Speaker 1>something and he was working as a stage </v>
<v Speaker 1>hand and his job was to hold up the </v>

35
00:01:49.861 --> 00:01:50.694
<v Speaker 1>speaker while Jimmy Hendrix was onstage </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the stage was so small and the </v>

36
00:01:53.911 --> 00:01:56.340
<v Speaker 1>speaker was kind of rocking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he had a stand there,</v>

37
00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.620
<v Speaker 1>stand there and hold up the speaker and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

38
00:01:58.621 --> 00:02:01.650
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy Hendrix was feet in front of me.</v>

39
00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.120
<v Speaker 1>He said it was fucking incredible </v>
<v Speaker 1>tricks.</v>

40
00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.220
<v Speaker 1>Was just sort of becoming Hendrix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be like 1966.</v>

41
00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.040
<v Speaker 1>I could go back over when he died and </v>
<v Speaker 1>when he would have been like 18 or 19,</v>

42
00:02:17.041 --> 00:02:19.620
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She'd done 1970.</v>

43
00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.030
<v Speaker 1>Really pretty sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>

44
00:02:22.031 --> 00:02:27.031
<v Speaker 1>Look at you and Encyclopedia Britannica.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hartman died in I think 98,</v>

45
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.580
<v Speaker 1>so whatever that was 20 years before </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

46
00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:33.723
<v Speaker 1>There's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This would have been like in the early </v>

47
00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:35.490
<v Speaker 1>seventies I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

48
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:36.720
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually.</v>

49
00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.980
<v Speaker 1>I wish we could go back in time and </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience music like in the sixties and</v>

50
00:02:40.981 --> 00:02:43.440
<v Speaker 1>seventies when it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like everything was new.</v>

51
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.440
<v Speaker 1>He'd never heard anything like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

52
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.333
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the first time they got real </v>

53
00:02:48.151 --> 00:02:51.870
<v Speaker 1>drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait first time where the demonic chords</v>

54
00:02:51.871 --> 00:02:52.704
<v Speaker 1>band.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were talking about this the other </v>

55
00:02:52.951 --> 00:02:53.784
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a long time back in the </v>

56
00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.420
<v Speaker 1>renaissance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>16 hundreds.</v>

57
00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.010
<v Speaker 1>There was corps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They thought to evil.</v>

58
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:01.383
<v Speaker 1>They heard the shit we played today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be like you'd be burned at the </v>

59
00:03:04.061 --> 00:03:05.000
<v Speaker 1>stake because.</v>

60
00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:09.430
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck that.</v>

61
00:03:09.431 --> 00:03:12.310
<v Speaker 1>He would have been toast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll just the beginning of Voodoo child</v>

62
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.760
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never get sick of that.</v>

63
00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.110
<v Speaker 1>But when you really stop and think about</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there was a.</v>

64
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.040
<v Speaker 1>There was a clear evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

65
00:03:21.041 --> 00:03:21.874
<v Speaker 1>There was a bunch of shit going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was chuck Berry and there was </v>

66
00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:24.643
<v Speaker 1>little Richard and then there was elvis </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there was all these rock and roll </v>

67
00:03:27.431 --> 00:03:28.264
<v Speaker 1>guys and then all the sudden there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>this eruption of that and it's led </v>

68
00:03:32.051 --> 00:03:37.051
<v Speaker 1>Zepplin and it's the WHO and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>hendricks and it's like people that were</v>

69
00:03:37.491 --> 00:03:42.491
<v Speaker 1>just on a completely different level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>queen queen in their prime.</v>

70
00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.740
<v Speaker 1>But it's interesting like they all were </v>
<v Speaker 1>driven.</v>

71
00:03:44.741 --> 00:03:49.050
<v Speaker 1>Like Zeplin was all blues music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just stole a of Shit.</v>

72
00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.560
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of shit that's fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

73
00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.750
<v Speaker 1>It's fucked up that they are dicks about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

74
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.033
<v Speaker 1>but it's not out of the ordinary because</v>
<v Speaker 1>all those dudes were just playing each </v>

75
00:03:59.411 --> 00:04:00.690
<v Speaker 1>other's songs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>

76
00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:01.563
<v Speaker 1>Dad is a giant problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're the guy who created the </v>

77
00:04:03.911 --> 00:04:07.330
<v Speaker 1>opening riff to stairway to heaven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's about your song and when you try to</v>

78
00:04:07.331 --> 00:04:08.164
<v Speaker 1>do with the other side of that spectrum </v>
<v Speaker 1>is really fucked up though too because </v>

79
00:04:10.751 --> 00:04:11.584
<v Speaker 1>now you're in this game where like if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you play anything remotely sounds like </v>

80
00:04:15.671 --> 00:04:19.150
<v Speaker 1>that you'll get sued.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at this point like,</v>

81
00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't rip off songs from other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

82
00:04:21.851 --> 00:04:23.440
<v Speaker 1>We don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like you could make,</v>

83
00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.390
<v Speaker 1>you could write a song and then not know</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it had a similar thing,</v>

84
00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.110
<v Speaker 1>similar melody and somebody could come </v>
<v Speaker 1>after you and that fucking blows.</v>

85
00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:33.123
<v Speaker 1>We were just talking about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>bittersweet symphony song from the </v>

86
00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:36.373
<v Speaker 1>verve.</v>

87
00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:37.293
<v Speaker 1>How they gave all their money to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rolling stones because the opening riff </v>

88
00:04:39.971 --> 00:04:41.670
<v Speaker 1>was too similar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is crazy.</v>

89
00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:43.390
<v Speaker 1>They took a sample,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

90
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.411
<v Speaker 1>It's like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

91
00:04:44.411 --> 00:04:45.244
<v Speaker 1>This is kind of Andrew Oldham produced </v>
<v Speaker 1>the stones and did all this </v>

92
00:04:47.771 --> 00:04:49.720
<v Speaker 1>orchestrations for them and they just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

93
00:04:49.721 --> 00:04:52.000
<v Speaker 1>they just said that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does that work though?</v>

94
00:04:52.001 --> 00:04:54.700
<v Speaker 1>That seems kind of crazy that you give </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the money.</v>

95
00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mind you give him the money.</v>

96
00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.843
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure they didn't give all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they had publishing on their </v>

97
00:04:59.591 --> 00:05:01.760
<v Speaker 1>actual song.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that different?</v>

98
00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:02.560
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the facts.</v>

99
00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.393
<v Speaker 1>Is it different like as a musician,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you feel like that feels different </v>

100
00:05:05.841 --> 00:05:09.640
<v Speaker 1>with someone just uses like or like if </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone heard ice ice baby,</v>

101
00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.550
<v Speaker 1>they knew it was under pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

102
00:05:12.551 --> 00:05:13.384
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like it's not hurting your </v>

103
00:05:14.201 --> 00:05:15.034
<v Speaker 1>original solid operation at that point </v>
<v Speaker 1>because your song was inspired by </v>

104
00:05:17.891 --> 00:05:20.440
<v Speaker 1>another song and obviously there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>credit due for that,</v>

105
00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:21.303
<v Speaker 1>but it's just an interesting way that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the pie gets cut up and the way people </v>

106
00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.570
<v Speaker 1>just tenaciously hold onto their piece </v>
<v Speaker 1>in this way.</v>

107
00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:31.240
<v Speaker 1>That I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really bums me out to be.</v>

108
00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously you need to get paid </v>
<v Speaker 1>and make a living,</v>

109
00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.680
<v Speaker 1>but inspirationally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just.</v>

110
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:39.543
<v Speaker 1>The barometer is just so like people </v>
<v Speaker 1>just go so far off the chorus in order </v>

111
00:05:44.291 --> 00:05:47.350
<v Speaker 1>to get credit and money for things that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just bullshit,</v>

112
00:05:47.351 --> 00:05:48.184
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's so different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were just talking about that in </v>

113
00:05:49.481 --> 00:05:50.314
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so difficult to have a career that </v>

114
00:05:52.031 --> 00:05:56.320
<v Speaker 1>keeps paying you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If anybody has something that's close to</v>

115
00:05:56.321 --> 00:05:57.470
<v Speaker 1>the sun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just like,</v>

116
00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:58.693
<v Speaker 1>that's it because that's the only way </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be able to afford this </v>

117
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.350
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The music business in particular or the.</v>

118
00:06:03.351 --> 00:06:04.184
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't say the music business </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I never really said the comedy </v>

119
00:06:06.501 --> 00:06:08.180
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say the comedy world,</v>

120
00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:13.900
<v Speaker 1>because I think you guys are like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>closest to big business in the way,</v>

121
00:06:15.051 --> 00:06:16.340
<v Speaker 1>like your contracts.</v>

122
00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.550
<v Speaker 1>Are you always here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nike's nightmare contractual Jesus.</v>

123
00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:20.863
<v Speaker 1>Like for us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've never made money doing anything </v>

124
00:06:23.391 --> 00:06:24.224
<v Speaker 1>but performing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so no one ever like got a grip of the </v>

125
00:06:26.781 --> 00:06:28.280
<v Speaker 1>other stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

126
00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:31.340
<v Speaker 1>Like with musicians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys all made a lot of money selling</v>

127
00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:36.400
<v Speaker 1>actual albums back in the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Musicians that it could have folks to.</v>

128
00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:37.753
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I guess they always went through </v>

129
00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:40.550
<v Speaker 1>record labels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No money in it.</v>

130
00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:43.490
<v Speaker 1>There was no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I should say like a few guys made</v>

131
00:06:43.491 --> 00:06:44.324
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Dane Cook probably made a ton of </v>

132
00:06:45.021 --> 00:06:49.130
<v Speaker 1>money because he had the biggest selling</v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy album of all time.</v>

133
00:06:49.131 --> 00:06:52.040
<v Speaker 1>His was his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least platinum.</v>

134
00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:53.053
<v Speaker 1>It might've went double platinum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you get paid as an actor at that </v>

135
00:06:55.491 --> 00:06:57.350
<v Speaker 1>point or is it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it.</v>

136
00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:58.070
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he must.</v>

137
00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:58.903
<v Speaker 1>He must have had a deal with the record </v>
<v Speaker 1>company unless he released it </v>

138
00:07:00.411 --> 00:07:01.244
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people can release their stuff </v>

139
00:07:01.941 --> 00:07:02.774
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know.</v>

140
00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:05.350
<v Speaker 1>This isn't live DVD.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

141
00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.240
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as soon as it gets to be a live DVD,</v>

142
00:07:08.241 --> 00:07:09.074
<v Speaker 1>there's two options.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is you could pay for it all </v>

143
00:07:12.831 --> 00:07:13.664
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pay for the filming and then sell it to </v>

144
00:07:15.891 --> 00:07:16.724
<v Speaker 1>whatever organization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's Netflix or what have your </v>

145
00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:20.660
<v Speaker 1>comedy central.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could do it that way.</v>

146
00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:21.940
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is this?</v>

147
00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:26.430
<v Speaker 1>Both of them went platinum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The platinum.</v>

148
00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:27.750
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

149
00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:30.530
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a huge sales.</v>

150
00:07:30.531 --> 00:07:32.550
<v Speaker 1>One million,</v>
<v Speaker 1>$215,000</v>

151
00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:35.920
<v Speaker 1>and 1 million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two hundred or 264,000</v>

152
00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:37.700
<v Speaker 1>for the second one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's incredible.</v>

153
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:38.833
<v Speaker 1>Like for a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a standup comedian to sell that </v>

154
00:07:40.521 --> 00:07:42.040
<v Speaker 1>many albums.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a real.</v>

155
00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:46.010
<v Speaker 1>He bought them for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

156
00:07:46.011 --> 00:07:47.750
<v Speaker 1>That's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm wondering what was number one?</v>

157
00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:50.090
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

158
00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:52.590
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But theory,</v>

159
00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.510
<v Speaker 1>US comedy number one and two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

160
00:07:56.511 --> 00:07:57.500
<v Speaker 1>he's right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number one,</v>

161
00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:59.200
<v Speaker 1>but at the time the second one read </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

162
00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:02.150
<v Speaker 1>That's the highest I ever got was number</v>
<v Speaker 1>two.</v>

163
00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:05.060
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone out peaked.</v>

164
00:08:05.061 --> 00:08:10.061
<v Speaker 1>Old Chart Positions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Live audio record.</v>

165
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.590
<v Speaker 1>So that was number one on the comedy </v>
<v Speaker 1>charts.</v>

166
00:08:12.591 --> 00:08:15.680
<v Speaker 1>It was number one period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck would say?</v>

167
00:08:15.681 --> 00:08:17.490
<v Speaker 1>Number two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his was number one.</v>

168
00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:20.270
<v Speaker 1>Number four in the whole us chart </v>
<v Speaker 1>overall.</v>

169
00:08:20.271 --> 00:08:21.860
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>

170
00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:23.840
<v Speaker 1>That's huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's giant.</v>

171
00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:26.060
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's it.</v>

172
00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:27.163
<v Speaker 1>Like I didn't make shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I made some money when I had a </v>

173
00:08:28.821 --> 00:08:33.821
<v Speaker 1>record on warner brothers in 1999.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like a space monkey thing.</v>

174
00:08:35.091 --> 00:08:35.924
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was called I'm going to be dead </v>

175
00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.270
<v Speaker 1>someday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was my first thing.</v>

176
00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.910
<v Speaker 1>And then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then uh,</v>

177
00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:45.970
<v Speaker 1>the next one was a shiny happy jihad </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was Uhm,</v>

178
00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:47.203
<v Speaker 1>and then talking monkeys and space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need to get our collection for the </v>

179
00:08:51.231 --> 00:08:53.870
<v Speaker 1>road travels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll hook you guys up.</v>

180
00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:59.150
<v Speaker 1>How many albums you guys have?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No trace albums.</v>

181
00:08:59.160 --> 00:08:59.993
<v Speaker 1>Tricks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we just were releasing solo records </v>

182
00:09:01.411 --> 00:09:03.810
<v Speaker 1>this year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's been like a really interesting,</v>

183
00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:07.410
<v Speaker 1>like we're working together and </v>
<v Speaker 1>separately it's crazy.</v>

184
00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:08.513
<v Speaker 1>You just keeping it together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get weird with each other all the </v>

185
00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:11.710
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah.</v>

186
00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:15.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that is the way it is always.</v>

187
00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:16.950
<v Speaker 1>It's always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly,</v>

188
00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:20.970
<v Speaker 1>always will be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like as long as everyone's kind,</v>

189
00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:25.500
<v Speaker 1>it's unavoidable and it's part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>process of dealing with people.</v>

190
00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:29.070
<v Speaker 1>Well we get on each other's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We definitely act like shit heads.</v>

191
00:09:29.071 --> 00:09:32.970
<v Speaker 1>And then we have these moments of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>great communication.</v>

192
00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:35.810
<v Speaker 1>That's the end goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

193
00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:36.713
<v Speaker 1>I think I can say that our relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>has made my other relationships in my </v>

194
00:09:40.771 --> 00:09:41.604
<v Speaker 1>life so much better because you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>administer patients and listen and </v>

195
00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:49.680
<v Speaker 1>really just have a target for people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

196
00:09:49.681 --> 00:09:51.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you got to learn how to be wrong,</v>

197
00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:52.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and say you're sorry when you fuck up.</v>

198
00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:54.120
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm sorry I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was wrong.</v>

199
00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:55.800
<v Speaker 1>I was stupid of me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't have said that.</v>

200
00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:56.753
<v Speaker 1>It's also there's a balancing act that </v>
<v Speaker 1>some people never achieve of listening </v>

201
00:09:59.581 --> 00:10:00.414
<v Speaker 1>to someone and thinking about what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're saying and then responding </v>

202
00:10:02.971 --> 00:10:05.310
<v Speaker 1>because of that or just saying what's on</v>
<v Speaker 1>your mind.</v>

203
00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:08.130
<v Speaker 1>Like there's this balancing act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you just want to say what's on</v>

204
00:10:08.131 --> 00:10:12.690
<v Speaker 1>your mind and sometimes you have to like</v>
<v Speaker 1>absorb what this person is saying to you</v>

205
00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:13.823
<v Speaker 1>and then you have to respect it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>address it and try to figure out how as </v>

206
00:10:16.801 --> 00:10:17.634
<v Speaker 1>a person that cares about them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the best way to get out what </v>

207
00:10:20.911 --> 00:10:22.480
<v Speaker 1>you're thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you don't do that.</v>

208
00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:23.883
<v Speaker 1>Then you have to deal with emotions </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening at the same goddamn which </v>

209
00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:32.240
<v Speaker 1>completely changed the way you can speak</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that I got to.</v>

210
00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:36.390
<v Speaker 1>I got a great therapist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love her so much and she,</v>

211
00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:40.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>accepting people is a huge deal and just</v>

212
00:10:40.051 --> 00:10:40.681
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

213
00:10:40.681 --> 00:10:43.860
<v Speaker 1>you and I have very different truths or </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

214
00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:44.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not you and I,</v>

215
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:49.870
<v Speaker 1>but for anyone and when you're arguing </v>
<v Speaker 1>with somebody or you're in disagreement,</v>

216
00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:53.670
<v Speaker 1>what is true to them could be completely</v>
<v Speaker 1>different to you,</v>

217
00:10:53.671 --> 00:10:56.820
<v Speaker 1>but you know the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you just fight that and keep fighting</v>

218
00:10:56.821 --> 00:11:01.140
<v Speaker 1>that you're going to be so fucked and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like there's no,</v>

219
00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:05.610
<v Speaker 1>there's no piece involved in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that scenario.</v>

220
00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:07.580
<v Speaker 1>So just like accepting your differences </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

221
00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:10.770
<v Speaker 1>is half the battle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do we relay your message to the rest</v>

222
00:11:10.771 --> 00:11:15.771
<v Speaker 1>of the world and solve that problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world's worlds in conflict or how to</v>

223
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:19.770
<v Speaker 1>say you're sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>learn how to be wrong and then,</v>

224
00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:23.820
<v Speaker 1>and then listen to each other for crying</v>
<v Speaker 1>out loud.</v>

225
00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:28.830
<v Speaker 1>I think that's so important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like people want to be right when</v>

226
00:11:28.831 --> 00:11:32.370
<v Speaker 1>you politics right now are just such a </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit show.</v>

227
00:11:32.371 --> 00:11:33.204
<v Speaker 1>And if I try to stay on board,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just get so exhausted because it's </v>

228
00:11:37.051 --> 00:11:39.090
<v Speaker 1>never ending.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>

229
00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:43.080
<v Speaker 1>there's no moment of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of peace.</v>

230

<v Speaker 2>Somebody sent it to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know who it was and they posted</v>

00:12:46.691 --> 00:12:49.420

<v Speaker 2>it was stealing jokes,</v>

253
00:12:49.421 --> 00:12:50.254
<v Speaker 2>but if I don't it was his.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It definitely would have given them </v>

258
00:12:59.441 --> 00:13:00.274
<v Speaker 2>You can't help drop truth bombs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's Alex Jones in a hot tub with </v>

259
00:13:03.071 --> 00:13:04.030
<v Speaker 2>sunglasses on.</v>

260
00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:10.030
<v Speaker 2>Just such a perfect meme for Alex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a real art form.</v>

<v Speaker 2>People try to relax,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're still.</v>

266
00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.360
<v Speaker 2>You just have to drop another truth </v>
<v Speaker 2>bomb.</v>

267
00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:27.640
<v Speaker 2>Really Fun.</v>

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:31.700
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that might be a filter.</v>

270
00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:34.540
<v Speaker 2>Instagram uses a lot of filters and make</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look unhealthy.</v>

271
00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:39.190
<v Speaker 2>That's shaming with the meme stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

272
00:13:39.191 --> 00:13:41.550
<v Speaker 2>Now it's like if you start stealing </v>
<v Speaker 2>people's memes,</v>

273
00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:43.180
<v Speaker 2>you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a target.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Well yeah,</v>

275
00:13:44.471 --> 00:13:46.930
<v Speaker 2>but the problem is a lot of people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>still not aware.</v>

276
00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:49.810
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a lot of people that have </v>
<v Speaker 2>become famous because they have websites</v>

277
00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:50.673
<v Speaker 2>and their pages get millions and </v>
<v Speaker 2>millions and millions of followers and </v>

278
00:13:52.481 --> 00:13:53.870
<v Speaker 2>all they're doing is stealing people's </v>
<v Speaker 2>feelings.</v>

279
00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:54.703
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And some of them have been forced to </v>

280
00:13:55.931 --> 00:13:59.410
<v Speaker 2>credit people and some of them just sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of like that fat Jewish guy.</v>

281
00:13:59.411 --> 00:14:01.240
<v Speaker 2>He just sorta writes the person who </v>
<v Speaker 2>created it.</v>

282
00:14:01.241 --> 00:14:03.600
<v Speaker 2>It's name in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

283
00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:06.170
<v Speaker 2>the big trouble trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>but it's the,</v>

286
00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:13.900
<v Speaker 2>it's the wild west.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

287
00:14:13.901 --> 00:14:17.320

<v Speaker 2>cosby.</v>

291
00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:28.630

<v Speaker 2>It's fucked up enough.</v>

292
00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:30.460
<v Speaker 2>I could show it to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he sends it to me.</v>

293
00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:31.733
<v Speaker 2>Ha.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He might've.</v>

298
00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:47.740
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea.</v>

299
00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:50.560
<v Speaker 2>Eddie does a lot of funny shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He might've made that himself.</v>

300
00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:52.010
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who</v>

<v Speaker 3>stuff like that.</v>

325
00:15:53.301 --> 00:15:54.134
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like collage when you got in</v>
<v Speaker 3>that little battle with a battle over </v>

338
00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:34.933
<v Speaker 3>similarly bitchy thing because I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>reading about memes in a different </v>

339
00:16:37.581 --> 00:16:38.414
<v Speaker 3>context.</v>

00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:48.100
<v Speaker 3>it kind of drove it home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He called me a poetry.</v>

346
00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:56.210
<v Speaker 3>I was narrow minded minded because you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't agree with his assessment of memes</v>

347
00:16:56.781 --> 00:16:59.480
<v Speaker 3>because I went back at him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what that means.</v>

348
00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:02.930
<v Speaker 3>Narrow my friends and being like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey honey,</v>

349
00:17:02.931 --> 00:17:03.770
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're great.</v>

350
00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:04.723
<v Speaker 3>That was a great moment because Vernon </v>
<v Speaker 3>Reid from sprinkled in living color </v>

351
00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:09.660
<v Speaker 3>chimed in and stood up and he was my </v>
<v Speaker 3>knight in shining.</v>

352
00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:14.190
<v Speaker 3>I think we as human beings have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>resist names of the cancer cells,</v>

353
00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:16.640
<v Speaker 3>the cultural imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh God.</v>

354
00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:17.803
<v Speaker 3>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I hate about it the most </v>

355
00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:20.570
<v Speaker 3>no capital letter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No period.</v>

356
00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:23.990
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't do that.</v>

357
00:17:24.070 --> 00:17:28.520
<v Speaker 3>We were on tour when it's cool man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But sorry,</v>

358
00:17:28.521 --> 00:17:30.410
<v Speaker 3>but you're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I like,</v>

359
00:17:30.411 --> 00:17:33.610
<v Speaker 3>I definitely can't claim any victory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pull over.</v>

360
00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:35.750
<v Speaker 3>We had to pull over so we could figure </v>
<v Speaker 3>out what to do.</v>

361
00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:37.463
<v Speaker 3>We'll have a cigarette holder if you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>writing that should have a black </v>

362
00:17:40.251 --> 00:17:42.020
<v Speaker 3>turtleneck and a cigarette holder.</v>

363
00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:43.473
<v Speaker 3>No Bull Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Listening to you should be listening to </v>

364
00:17:47.361 --> 00:17:50.970
<v Speaker 3>jazz if you wrote that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing to chance is great,</v>

365
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.130
<v Speaker 3>but there's some people that listen to </v>
<v Speaker 3>jazz just so people know.</v>

366
00:17:53.131 --> 00:17:55.290
<v Speaker 3>They're listening to jazz.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Know that guy.</v>

367
00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:59.970

<v Speaker 3>So I just remembered there's this great.</v>

368
00:17:59.971 --> 00:18:00.804
<v Speaker 3>You said Little Richard and Jimi Hendrix</v>
<v Speaker 3>before Jimi Hendrix was in little </v>

369
00:18:03.751 --> 00:18:05.150
<v Speaker 3>Richard's band.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know that?</v>

370
00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:06.930
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forgot about before he was.</v>

371
00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:07.710
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

372
00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:08.543
<v Speaker 3>He was this great [inaudible] interview </v>
<v Speaker 3>with Little Richard talking about Jimi </v>

373
00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:14.970
<v Speaker 3>Hendrix.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just high as a kite.</v>

374
00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:18.300
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And also,</v>

375
00:18:18.301 --> 00:18:22.650
<v Speaker 3>how about Jerry Lee Lewis?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jerry Lee Lewis fucking killed.</v>

376
00:18:22.651 --> 00:18:27.651

<v Speaker 3>He said he made my toe go up my boot.</v>

377
00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:30.870
<v Speaker 3>What heroin?</v>

378
00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:33.760
<v Speaker 1>My Body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only property.</v>

379
00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:34.673
<v Speaker 1>Ms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people haven't been put the dip by </v>

380
00:18:36.061 --> 00:18:36.894
<v Speaker 1>and pull back on the.</v>

<v Speaker 3>She's just a little.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Richard's amazing.</v>

382
00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:43.133
<v Speaker 1>You got to be placed into the dipper and</v>
<v Speaker 1>pulled back down on the world and then </v>

383
00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:50.400
<v Speaker 1>men would see your good works and </v>
<v Speaker 1>glorify God.</v>

384
00:18:50.401 --> 00:18:51.234
<v Speaker 1>Jehovah,</v>

385
00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:55.550
<v Speaker 3>Jimi Hendrix could play that rock and </v>
<v Speaker 3>roll,</v>

386
00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:56.693
<v Speaker 1>be singing rock and get them to be gone </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he had that thing just romping and </v>

387
00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:05.800
<v Speaker 1>dumping all up under my toes at times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He</v>

388
00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:07.810
<v Speaker 3>used to make my big toe shoot up in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>boot.</v>

389
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:10.833
<v Speaker 3>So good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He gave it all to you and that's what </v>

390
00:19:14.201 --> 00:19:16.490
<v Speaker 3>you want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want it all or none,</v>

391
00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:17.483
<v Speaker 3>but pause this right here and to go on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't aspire to just be so fucking </v>

392
00:19:24.101 --> 00:19:27.050
<v Speaker 3>fabulous that you are undeniable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Freddie Mercury.</v>

393
00:19:27.051 --> 00:19:27.884
<v Speaker 3>We were talking about him earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen those mid seventies shit </v>

394
00:19:30.281 --> 00:19:32.300
<v Speaker 3>and it blows my mind because the dude </v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't.</v>

395
00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:33.333
<v Speaker 3>He looks like Lord Far Quad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if that means anything to anybody </v>

396
00:19:36.311 --> 00:19:37.144
<v Speaker 3>but he but he's tall and he's got to </v>
<v Speaker 3>skin tight white suit and his mid </v>

397
00:19:40.181 --> 00:19:43.350
<v Speaker 3>seventies and he's gay and his Dick is </v>
<v Speaker 3>just like boom.</v>

398
00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:46.850
<v Speaker 3>Like you could just see his.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you did that,</v>

399
00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:48.700
<v Speaker 3>now you'd be done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't do that.</v>

400
00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:53.980
<v Speaker 3>Can know who is up on stage with their </v>
<v Speaker 3>dick hanging out and it was literally,</v>

401
00:19:55.511 --> 00:19:56.021
<v Speaker 3>you're just like,</v>

404
00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:01.570
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're doing a good job.</v>

405
00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:03.760
<v Speaker 3>Clearly presented here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me clear this up.</v>

406
00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:09.270
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't need to be outside of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>transparent material stuck.</v>

407
00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:12.610
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if Justin timberlake did that,</v>

408
00:20:12.611 --> 00:20:16.180
<v Speaker 3>it would be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just didn't do it.</v>

<v Speaker 3>See what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get those feet moving fast.</v>

410
00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:24.100
<v Speaker 3>Some of us want to know that it was so </v>
<v Speaker 3>different than that.</v>

411
00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:29.130
<v Speaker 3>People were somehow except pantyhose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what is he got this like skin tight</v>

<v Speaker 3>White.</v>

414

<v Speaker 3>But how did it make you feel?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your wife?</v>

415
00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:35.830
<v Speaker 3>I was with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're looking at his dick,</v>

416
00:20:35.831 --> 00:20:37.810
<v Speaker 3>like as if he was wearing tight </v>
<v Speaker 3>underwear,</v>

417
00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:39.490
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's beyond that.</v>

418
00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:45.140
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying about like what</v>
<v Speaker 3>about stuff like that?</v>

419
00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:46.623
<v Speaker 3>Like what movie about people stripping.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a live concert in front of </v>

420
00:20:50.411 --> 00:20:52.030
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anybody can fucking go.</v>

421
00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:55.720
<v Speaker 3>And the dude's just like Bam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just shocked me,</v>

422
00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:56.583
<v Speaker 3>Michelle and inspired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember those old led Zeppelin </v>

423
00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:02.440
<v Speaker 3>record released this fall?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember those old,</v>

424
00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:08.300
<v Speaker 3>those old led Zepplin pictures where he </v>
<v Speaker 3>would have his hard tucked up on side of</v>

425
00:21:08.621 --> 00:21:12.970
<v Speaker 3>his leg work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't lie about that.</v>

426
00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:15.340
<v Speaker 3>You can't fake that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody would know.</v>

427
00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:16.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when you wear underwear,</v>

428
00:21:16.751 --> 00:21:19.540
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't show it that and he probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>got hard before the photo.</v>

429
00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:24.580
<v Speaker 3>While you're young and of itself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let alone an angel.</v>

430
00:21:24.890 --> 00:21:27.760
<v Speaker 3>If you just put a rubber band around </v>
<v Speaker 3>your cock and balls,</v>

431
00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:28.893
<v Speaker 3>go on and do it like that's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That looks like that looks </v>

432
00:21:33.101 --> 00:21:35.090
<v Speaker 3>uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Definitely was.</v>

433
00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:40.750
<v Speaker 3>Definitely was you walk cock out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at the one.</v>

434

<v Speaker 3>he's Juba.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>

436
00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:45.340
<v Speaker 3>So imagine that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine that.</v>

437
00:21:45.341 --> 00:21:50.341
<v Speaker 3>But if you could see the outline there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that'd be Freddie Mercury.</v>

438
00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:52.373
<v Speaker 3>Then you know it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe all your problem put his dick to </v>

439
00:21:56.081 --> 00:22:00.010
<v Speaker 3>the right and one way you can't really </v>
<v Speaker 3>change it.</v>

440

<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

<v Speaker 3>it would be really gross,</v>

<v Speaker 3>to know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is just right down the middle.</v>

447
00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:27.693
<v Speaker 3>Symmetrical.</v>

<v Speaker 3>He's got to choose a leg and he's just </v>

450
00:22:36.581 --> 00:22:39.310
<v Speaker 3>gotten comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got like a groove on the left side.</v>

451
00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:41.160
<v Speaker 3>Toxins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Is that a scrotum?</v>

458

00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:02.243
<v Speaker 3>That's a real blank one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there was the real one that's </v>

461
00:23:06.371 --> 00:23:08.320
<v Speaker 3>attached to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Encyclopedia Britannica.</v>

462
00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:09.393
<v Speaker 3>Is that a real cover on that one?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You actually see his dick because I </v>

463
00:23:12.381 --> 00:23:16.690
<v Speaker 3>would say the implication that I have </v>
<v Speaker 3>these moments when we're podcasting,</v>

464
00:23:16.691 --> 00:23:17.231
<v Speaker 3>where I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

465
00:23:17.231 --> 00:23:19.430
<v Speaker 3>I hope my parents never listen to this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They might,</v>

466
00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:22.000
<v Speaker 3>they might really be into it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

467
00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:23.140
<v Speaker 3>What do you think then?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

468
00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:24.033
<v Speaker 3>here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been going through things with my </v>

469
00:23:25.511 --> 00:23:26.344
<v Speaker 3>mom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't really know each other that </v>

470
00:23:27.011 --> 00:23:29.990
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the truth and I feel like this.</v>

471
00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:32.170
<v Speaker 3>She would learn a lot about me and my </v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

472
00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:33.860
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's heavy.</v>

473
00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:35.560
<v Speaker 3>That's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Should we send it to her?</v>

474
00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:36.910
<v Speaker 3>Definitely not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

475
00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:40.420
<v Speaker 3>I think she could handle it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would be freaked out.</v>

476
00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:42.070
<v Speaker 3>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mom.</v>

477
00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:43.000
<v Speaker 3>It's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She,</v>

478
00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:46.190
<v Speaker 3>she's a delicate person whenever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean especially</v>

479
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:47.270
<v Speaker 2>in this day and age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whenever.</v>

480
00:23:47.271 --> 00:23:48.104
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever chance to sit and talk to </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone for three hours straight like </v>

481
00:23:50.541 --> 00:23:51.470
<v Speaker 2>this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's rare.</v>

482
00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:52.783
<v Speaker 2>This is sort of the cure for what ails </v>
<v Speaker 2>us when it comes to communicating like </v>

483
00:23:56.091 --> 00:23:56.924
<v Speaker 2>podcast because there's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so informal and it's really just </v>

484
00:24:00.051 --> 00:24:00.884
<v Speaker 2>like sitting down talking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what a lot of us don't ever </v>

485
00:24:03.621 --> 00:24:04.454
<v Speaker 2>have the chance to do anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone is always doing a million </v>

486
00:24:05.871 --> 00:24:07.130
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're always looking at your phone.</v>

487
00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:10.160
<v Speaker 2>You're always about to go somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to meeting gotta this,</v>

488
00:24:10.161 --> 00:24:10.994
<v Speaker 2>you gotta that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When the fuck do you ever get three </v>

489
00:24:11.781 --> 00:24:12.614
<v Speaker 2>hours?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just sit to just sit and chill thing it </v>

490
00:24:16.461 --> 00:24:17.294
<v Speaker 2>is and it seems to be here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but isn't it crazy that just talking is </v>

491
00:24:20.991 --> 00:24:25.610
<v Speaker 2>a special thing that shows you how weird</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are right now as human beings,</v>

492
00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:29.930
<v Speaker 2>as an organism that grew up in a social </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment.</v>

493
00:24:29.931 --> 00:24:30.764
<v Speaker 2>I mean every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every person that survives that's alive </v>

494
00:24:33.891 --> 00:24:38.420
<v Speaker 2>today comes from a history of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that were in tribes were in these little</v>

495
00:24:38.421 --> 00:24:41.840
<v Speaker 2>groups of people and social interaction </v>
<v Speaker 2>was everything.</v>

496
00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:45.290
<v Speaker 2>But you had to know each show was being </v>
<v Speaker 2>alone and that doesn't happen very often</v>

497
00:24:45.291 --> 00:24:46.580
<v Speaker 2>either when people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

498
00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:48.200
<v Speaker 2>I mean someone's Moody.</v>

499
00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:52.780
<v Speaker 4>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

500
00:24:52.790 --> 00:24:55.710
<v Speaker 4>but you're talking about like devices </v>
<v Speaker 4>couldn't help myself.</v>

501
00:24:56.120 --> 00:25:00.930
<v Speaker 4>I love you but your niche.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's true.</v>

502
00:25:00.931 --> 00:25:03.570
<v Speaker 4>Like we know you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're always so busy.</v>

503
00:25:03.571 --> 00:25:07.320
<v Speaker 4>There's always shit going on and like I </v>
<v Speaker 4>definitely have these moments where like</v>

504
00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:08.423
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't just sitting not talking to </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone or looking at my phone like I </v>

505
00:25:11.491 --> 00:25:14.190
<v Speaker 4>can't remember when I wasn't just </v>
<v Speaker 4>moving,</v>

506
00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:16.080
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and not even meditating.</v>

507
00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:17.220
<v Speaker 4>Just sitting.</v>

508
00:25:17.410 --> 00:25:18.243
<v Speaker 2>I've become super aware lease over the </v>
<v Speaker 2>last year that there's a lot of wasted </v>

509
00:25:22.361 --> 00:25:26.100
<v Speaker 2>time in looking at devices and computers</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I've.</v>

510
00:25:26.150 --> 00:25:30.010
<v Speaker 2>I've been real aware of it to the point </v>
<v Speaker 2>where I had a way my bend,</v>

511
00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:33.160
<v Speaker 2>the benefits of it are the benefits are </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty numerous.</v>

512
00:25:33.161 --> 00:25:33.994
<v Speaker 2>Like I get a lot of really interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>articles off of social media and really </v>

513
00:25:36.911 --> 00:25:37.744
<v Speaker 2>interesting articles that I find online </v>
<v Speaker 2>and really interesting up to date </v>

514
00:25:41.470 --> 00:25:44.830
<v Speaker 2>information about space and science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's very,</v>

515
00:25:44.831 --> 00:25:48.340
<v Speaker 2>very valuable to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then there's also a lot of scrolling</v>

516
00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:49.673
<v Speaker 4>constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's equally as fruitful as it is </v>

517
00:25:51.311 --> 00:25:52.144
<v Speaker 4>beguiling because you'll get fucked up </v>
<v Speaker 4>and lost in it and like I wanted to </v>

518
00:25:55.451 --> 00:25:59.200
<v Speaker 4>invent this app that I think someone </v>
<v Speaker 4>probably already did it,</v>

519
00:25:59.230 --> 00:26:00.063
<v Speaker 4>but that puts a lock on your social </v>
<v Speaker 4>media so you only get like 20 minutes a </v>

520
00:26:03.191 --> 00:26:06.040
<v Speaker 4>day and once it's done it's done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have those.</v>

521
00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:07.570
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I don't want it.</v>

522
00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:10.990
<v Speaker 4>You just want to develop some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's also crucial for our careers,</v>

523
00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:14.260
<v Speaker 4>like it's crucial to your.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your thing is built on social.</v>

524
00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:15.990
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

525
00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:19.980
<v Speaker 2>The thing is though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd need time alone where your board,</v>

526
00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:21.900
<v Speaker 2>this is what I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>read a book.</v>

527
00:26:22.050 --> 00:26:22.883
<v Speaker 2>I think you need time to just be able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>sit and think about something or do </v>

528
00:26:25.711 --> 00:26:28.260
<v Speaker 2>something like practice something when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

529
00:26:28.290 --> 00:26:29.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you guys are like this with </v>
<v Speaker 2>music,</v>

530
00:26:29.881 --> 00:26:30.714
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where you don't practice or I'm really </v>

531
00:26:32.370 --> 00:26:36.340
<v Speaker 2>envious of his discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He practices his guitar every day.</v>

532
00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:37.531
<v Speaker 2>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

533
00:26:37.531 --> 00:26:39.150
<v Speaker 2>you got to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like meditation.</v>

534
00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:40.500
<v Speaker 2>It's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

535
00:26:40.501 --> 00:26:43.770
<v Speaker 2>I think that there's something to that </v>
<v Speaker 2>for that.</v>

536
00:26:43.771 --> 00:26:43.980
<v Speaker 2>Some</v>

537
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:44.813
<v Speaker 5>people don't experience you put your </v>
<v Speaker 5>phone over there or shut it off or put </v>

538
00:26:47.841 --> 00:26:50.770
<v Speaker 5>an airplane mode and just do your thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

539
00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:54.570
<v Speaker 5>We know what's crazy about the practices</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you can separate,</v>

540
00:26:54.571 --> 00:26:55.404
<v Speaker 5>because it's tough because I'll have </v>
<v Speaker 5>devices on my phone that helped me </v>

541
00:26:58.171 --> 00:26:59.004
<v Speaker 5>practice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll metronomes and being this stuff's </v>

542
00:27:01.651 --> 00:27:06.651
<v Speaker 5>going up and the difference between when</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't have my phone,</v>

543
00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:09.810
<v Speaker 5>when I'm not communicating with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>social media world of texting,</v>

544
00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:11.940
<v Speaker 5>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and when I do,</v>

545
00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:14.730
<v Speaker 5>it's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In 20 minutes it's like working out.</v>

546
00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:15.653
<v Speaker 5>If you focus for 20 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's going to replace three hours of </v>

547
00:27:18.781 --> 00:27:20.910
<v Speaker 5>shitty working out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Am I right about that?</v>

548
00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:22.140
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for sure.</v>

549
00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:23.520
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's all about how much,</v>

550
00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:26.400
<v Speaker 5>how deep you can go in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

551
00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:29.190
<v Speaker 5>just a cognitively.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>

552
00:27:29.191 --> 00:27:30.660
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I think in general,</v>

553
00:27:30.661 --> 00:27:31.494
<v Speaker 5>people were like coming to grips with </v>
<v Speaker 5>this now as I Connecticut because we </v>

554
00:27:34.681 --> 00:27:36.720
<v Speaker 5>didn't fucking 10 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 5>none of this stuff existed.</v>

555
00:27:36.721 --> 00:27:37.554
<v Speaker 5>This is like fresh out the gate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So we're trying to figure this out and </v>

556
00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:43.080
<v Speaker 5>there's this dude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You just see people paying more and more</v>

557
00:27:43.081 --> 00:27:43.914
<v Speaker 5>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Exactly what you're saying is this guy </v>

558
00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:48.720
<v Speaker 5>that wrote a book called deep work and </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's going viral.</v>

559
00:27:48.721 --> 00:27:49.554
<v Speaker 5>People are paying attention to this </v>
<v Speaker 5>guy's ideas that are exactly what we're </v>

560
00:27:51.211 --> 00:27:52.044
<v Speaker 5>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You need to shut off social media </v>

561
00:27:53.581 --> 00:27:54.810
<v Speaker 5>advice,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

562
00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:56.690
<v Speaker 5>stuff input,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

563
00:27:57.090 --> 00:28:02.090
<v Speaker 5>and allow your brain to sink down deep.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's where real value comes from,</v>

564
00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:04.060
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

565
00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:04.893
<v Speaker 3>The only way to access simple real value</v>
<v Speaker 3>where people don't even realize how it </v>

566
00:28:08.291 --> 00:28:10.780
<v Speaker 3>will take over your life in your </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationships.</v>

567
00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:11.740
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's new.</v>

568
00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:14.650
<v Speaker 3>It's too new.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>

569
00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:19.480
<v Speaker 3>So what is it like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shut up 1994 is the internet.</v>

570
00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:20.493
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's like the main spread of the </v>

571
00:28:21.911 --> 00:28:24.290
<v Speaker 3>Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now remember when we had this,</v>

572
00:28:24.450 --> 00:28:25.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

573
00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:27.880
<v Speaker 3>and it was like be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was electric.</v>

574

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Before that there were no apps.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a thing.</v>

592
00:29:10.241 --> 00:29:10.811
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

593
00:29:10.811 --> 00:29:12.910
<v Speaker 3>we did our first round motor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has been a thing with us,</v>

594
00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:13.773
<v Speaker 3>with us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Puzzle are you take this little </v>

595
00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:18.130
<v Speaker 3>character and you propel him with his </v>
<v Speaker 3>own farts,</v>

596
00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:21.760
<v Speaker 3>with your space bar and your arrows and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you think it sounds stupid,</v>

597
00:29:21.761 --> 00:29:24.010
<v Speaker 3>but you play your first game and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>just laughing.</v>

598
00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:25.173
<v Speaker 3>I love Neil degrasse Tyson and then he </v>
<v Speaker 3>has us talking about how you live your </v>

599
00:29:31.481 --> 00:29:32.314
<v Speaker 3>truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is actually something that brought </v>

600
00:29:35.081 --> 00:29:37.690
<v Speaker 3>us a lot of joy to start demo level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seems like you play.</v>

601
00:29:38.170 --> 00:29:39.490
<v Speaker 3>Did you play it online?</v>

602
00:29:39.730 --> 00:29:40.151
<v Speaker 5>Get it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>get it,</v>

603
00:29:40.151 --> 00:29:40.511
<v Speaker 5>get it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>get it.</v>

604
00:29:40.511 --> 00:29:41.980
<v Speaker 5>Yet it got to get</v>

605
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:43.960
<v Speaker 3>some sound.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>

606
00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:45.853
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to play puzzle Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie's going to operate the controls </v>

607
00:29:49.241 --> 00:29:54.241
<v Speaker 3>and play puzzle for one day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Challenge yourself a lot of fun.</v>

608
00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:56.440
<v Speaker 3>I just don't think people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

609
00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:57.313
<v Speaker 2>used to the idea of being alone anymore </v>
<v Speaker 2>without these devices and that's only </v>

610
00:30:01.721 --> 00:30:02.740
<v Speaker 2>been around for 10 years.</v>

611
00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:07.690
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot of false comfort,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think there's also like,</v>

612
00:30:07.691 --> 00:30:11.320
<v Speaker 3>there's all these different disorders </v>
<v Speaker 3>and things that they're coming up with,</v>

613
00:30:11.321 --> 00:30:12.154
<v Speaker 3>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>young kids and their identity with </v>

614
00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:15.033
<v Speaker 3>instagram and how it reflects their self</v>
<v Speaker 3>worth and how many likes they get and </v>

615
00:30:18.011 --> 00:30:20.170
<v Speaker 3>who liked their photos and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really scary.</v>

616
00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:22.420
<v Speaker 3>It's really until today where they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying</v>

617
00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:23.333
<v Speaker 2>the girls as early as nine years old and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then surgery to make their vaginas look </v>

618
00:30:26.621 --> 00:30:29.100
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not true.</v>

619
00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:31.470
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really might have be making it up.</v>

620
00:30:31.471 --> 00:30:32.304
<v Speaker 2>Just so talk.</v>

621
00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:33.143
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's in the daily mail so </v>

622
00:30:37.681 --> 00:30:40.390
<v Speaker 3>it might be questionable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but as parents what?</v>

623
00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:41.413
<v Speaker 3>But I know that vagina surgeries like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like aesthetic vagina surgeries are on </v>

624
00:30:46.351 --> 00:30:47.550
<v Speaker 3>the rise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

625
00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:49.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they didn't exist.</v>

626
00:30:49.490 --> 00:30:53.770
<v Speaker 3>There was a trend when you would die </v>
<v Speaker 3>your pubes blue and put a be dazzled.</v>

627
00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:56.500
<v Speaker 3>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

628
00:30:56.501 --> 00:31:01.501
<v Speaker 3>trying to surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's much talking about the same pipe.</v>

629
00:31:04.210 --> 00:31:07.020
<v Speaker 3>This is the BBC guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come on,</v>

630
00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:08.290
<v Speaker 3>that can't be right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

631
00:31:08.610 --> 00:31:13.050
<v Speaker 3>but that headline,</v>
<v Speaker 3>vaginal surgery sought by girls as young</v>

632
00:31:13.051 --> 00:31:13.710
<v Speaker 3>as nine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me.</v>

633
00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:15.510
<v Speaker 3>Vagina is a crazy looking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

634
00:31:15.511 --> 00:31:16.860
<v Speaker 3>but how.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

635
00:31:16.890 --> 00:31:20.980
<v Speaker 3>here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people get weird.</v>

636
00:31:21.150 --> 00:31:23.010
<v Speaker 3>You're right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a lot harder to discriminate.</v>

637
00:31:23.011 --> 00:31:27.630
<v Speaker 3>Sorry to interrupt you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I beg to differ to operate on a dick</v>

638
00:31:27.631 --> 00:31:28.590
<v Speaker 3>than a vagina.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't fuck it.</v>

639
00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:32.580
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about are we really making </v>
<v Speaker 3>judgment calls here and what's more.</v>

640
00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:35.510
<v Speaker 3>I really hope your mom doesn't listen to</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of these things that we know nothing</v>

641
00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:38.710
<v Speaker 3>about is more difficult operating on </v>
<v Speaker 3>body parts.</v>

642
00:31:39.930 --> 00:31:42.910
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you know like this</v>

643
00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.110
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like cnn just got busted for they get,</v>

644
00:31:47.150 --> 00:31:50.600
<v Speaker 2>they fired a bunch of people for writing</v>
<v Speaker 2>some story about trump and Russia.</v>

645
00:31:50.601 --> 00:31:52.160
<v Speaker 2>That wasn't true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You hear about that.</v>

646
00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:53.333
<v Speaker 2>People get like super over zealous </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to make a story real when they </v>

647
00:31:57.801 --> 00:32:00.530
<v Speaker 2>didn't do like all the background work </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was necessary.</v>

648
00:32:00.531 --> 00:32:01.364
<v Speaker 2>And people go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's why trump can get away </v>

649
00:32:02.721 --> 00:32:04.730
<v Speaker 2>with calling cnn fake news,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

650
00:32:05.170 --> 00:32:08.030
<v Speaker 2>Because they're doing children's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether they're doing desperado shit,</v>

651
00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:08.893
<v Speaker 2>they're getting into that blurry area </v>
<v Speaker 2>where they're doing things that are a </v>

652
00:32:12.061 --> 00:32:15.110
<v Speaker 2>little bit sensational,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little sensationalism,</v>

653
00:32:15.111 --> 00:32:17.490
<v Speaker 2>and they're trying to get people to pay </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention and the pedal.</v>

654
00:32:17.530 --> 00:32:20.410
<v Speaker 2>We know that that's not the case here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when you see somebody,</v>

655
00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:23.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure women are getting vagina </v>
<v Speaker 2>surgeries,</v>

656
00:32:24.050 --> 00:32:25.910
<v Speaker 2>we've heard of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know it's a real thing.</v>

657
00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:28.220
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you see as early as nine,</v>

658
00:32:28.221 --> 00:32:31.490
<v Speaker 2>like manifests an instant click bait </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>

659
00:32:31.491 --> 00:32:32.324
<v Speaker 2>proud saying as young as nine that might</v>
<v Speaker 2>be worth fucking hundreds of thousands </v>

660
00:32:36.621 --> 00:32:37.610
<v Speaker 2>of dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

661
00:32:37.670 --> 00:32:38.270
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

662
00:32:38.270 --> 00:32:40.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm just kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's one case of</v>

663
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:40.843
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could point to that as a reference </v>

664
00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:45.710
<v Speaker 1>and we'll see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I absurdity of a young child,</v>

665
00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:46.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone,</v>

666
00:32:46.761 --> 00:32:51.761
<v Speaker 1>anyone like looking at their vagina in </v>
<v Speaker 1>any kind of pleasurable way,</v>

667
00:32:52.831 --> 00:32:53.664
<v Speaker 1>it's totally fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why would a kid care about the </v>

668
00:32:55.701 --> 00:32:57.350
<v Speaker 1>appearance of their vagina?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what I mean?</v>

669
00:32:57.351 --> 00:32:58.700
<v Speaker 1>Like none of this makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

670
00:32:58.701 --> 00:32:59.660
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

671
00:32:59.661 --> 00:33:00.494
<v Speaker 1>what's even creepier as you cut baby </v>
<v Speaker 1>degree to make them look better for </v>

672
00:33:03.801 --> 00:33:06.000
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did that for Jews.</v>

673
00:33:06.001 --> 00:33:10.100
<v Speaker 1>This dude chooses not to be too </v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable here.</v>

674
00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:11.421

00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:59.320
<v Speaker 1>but to turn it over it's an aesthetic </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

<v Speaker 1>who benefits from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm curious like just beyond the veil,</v>

720
00:35:26.810 --> 00:35:27.643
<v Speaker 1>like what is the point they get to </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone to get paid for you clicking </v>

00:35:30.201 --> 00:35:31.034
<v Speaker 1>that button?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I hate that,</v>

723
00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:35.413
<v Speaker 1>but it's the same shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean like why do people buy fucking </v>

724
00:35:36.471 --> 00:35:38.100
<v Speaker 1>Doritos?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing,</v>

725
00:35:38.101 --> 00:35:39.120
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

726
00:35:39.121 --> 00:35:44.121
<v Speaker 1>What do you hate about it though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I want to use my time and energy</v>

727
00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:50.180
<v Speaker 1>wisely and not wasted on things like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that because I'd rather like sit with my</v>

728
00:35:50.911 --> 00:35:55.140
<v Speaker 1>phone off and my computer off or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or learn something that is beneficial.</v>

729
00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:57.690
<v Speaker 1>I think that's just wasteful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's junk food.</v>

<v Speaker 1>They're horrible.</v>

751
00:36:51.930 --> 00:36:56.910
<v Speaker 1>And the government has decided to outlaw</v>
<v Speaker 1>trans fats in two years.</v>

752
00:37:00.010 --> 00:37:02.250
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Just shallow going dive because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>obesity,</v>

754
00:37:06.181 --> 00:37:08.190
<v Speaker 1>because you're addicted to sucking down </v>
<v Speaker 1>these things.</v>

755
00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:10.530
<v Speaker 1>What am I going into the transplant in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada,</v>

00:37:10.830 --> 00:37:14.550
<v Speaker 1>they have their Heinz Ketchup and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>have our Heinz Ketchup in the Canadian.</v>

757
00:37:14.551 --> 00:37:16.800
<v Speaker 1>Heinz Ketchup does not have high </v>
<v Speaker 1>fructose corn syrup.</v>

758
00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:18.270
<v Speaker 1>What does it have?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sugar.</v>

759
00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:19.793
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't have high fructose corn </v>

760
00:37:20.971 --> 00:37:23.310
<v Speaker 1>syrup because it's band.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>

761
00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:26.100
<v Speaker 1>It tasted differently and I liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not kidding.</v>

762
00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:27.143
<v Speaker 1>I just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's interesting that like </v>

763
00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:29.213
<v Speaker 1>right on the other side of this border,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have better ketchup whether they </v>

764
00:37:31.981 --> 00:37:34.830
<v Speaker 1>have better coca cola in Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do use cane sugar.</v>

765
00:37:34.831 --> 00:37:37.070
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

766
00:37:37.130 --> 00:37:38.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really drink coca cola,</v>

767
00:37:38.791 --> 00:37:39.624
<v Speaker 1>but it's just interesting what the FDA </v>
<v Speaker 1>approves in our country for the food </v>

768
00:37:43.171 --> 00:37:44.300
<v Speaker 1>that we eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>

769
00:37:44.510 --> 00:37:46.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

770
00:37:46.831 --> 00:37:47.664
<v Speaker 1>All those government agencies are bunch </v>
<v Speaker 1>of puppets when it comes to diet and </v>

771
00:37:50.250 --> 00:37:54.660
<v Speaker 1>exercise and what you're allowed to put </v>
<v Speaker 1>in cigarettes and what you're allowed to</v>

772
00:37:54.661 --> 00:37:55.494
<v Speaker 1>put in all sorts of different drugs that</v>
<v Speaker 1>get past it is fucking bananas that </v>

00:37:59.581 --> 00:38:03.090
<v Speaker 1>there were talking about Nevada just </v>
<v Speaker 1>became legal for marijuana.</v>

774
00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:08.630
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking bananas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How it took until 2017.</v>

775
00:38:08.641 --> 00:38:10.530
<v Speaker 1>We're states finally started making </v>
<v Speaker 1>weed,</v>

776
00:38:10.531 --> 00:38:11.364
<v Speaker 1>legal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All people are dropping off left and </v>

777
00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:18.270
<v Speaker 1>right from opiates pills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there was a study that Dr Hart.</v>

778
00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:22.200
<v Speaker 1>Is that his name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's on my,</v>

779
00:38:22.201 --> 00:38:23.610
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my twitter.</v>

780
00:38:23.970 --> 00:38:27.300
<v Speaker 1>I tweeted it uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>earlier today or last night,</v>

781
00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:28.400
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

782
00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:33.400
<v Speaker 1>it was 93 percent of patients that have </v>
<v Speaker 1>pain preferred cannabis over opiods.</v>

783
00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:35.710
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>

784
00:38:35.711 --> 00:38:36.150
<v Speaker 1>Opioids,</v>

785
00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:37.800
<v Speaker 4>opioids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>opioids.</v>

786
00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:41.080
<v Speaker 4>Opioids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can attest to that.</v>

787
00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:41.933
<v Speaker 4>They of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean a menstrual cramps are </v>

788
00:38:47.081 --> 00:38:47.914
<v Speaker 4>debilitating for some ladies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll be honest and that's why I got my </v>

789
00:38:51.521 --> 00:38:56.000
<v Speaker 4>weed license because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is night and day thing.</v>

790
00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:59.590
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they feel comfortable.</v>

791
00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:00.753
<v Speaker 4>They have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have depositories that you put in </v>

792
00:39:03.271 --> 00:39:04.390
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in your twinkle,</v>

793
00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:07.840
<v Speaker 4>just no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't get you.</v>

794
00:39:07.841 --> 00:39:11.620
<v Speaker 4>I mean they get your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they make this warm,</v>

795
00:39:12.130 --> 00:39:12.963
<v Speaker 4>wonderful feeling in your belly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is the antithesis of writhing in </v>

796
00:39:16.631 --> 00:39:18.910
<v Speaker 4>pain and being out of commission for a </v>
<v Speaker 4>day,</v>

797
00:39:19.690 --> 00:39:20.523
<v Speaker 4>which happens every month.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get one or two days where I'm just </v>

798
00:39:22.271 --> 00:39:23.470
<v Speaker 4>down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm in so much pain,</v>

799
00:39:23.471 --> 00:39:25.690
<v Speaker 4>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't do anything and it's awful.</v>

800
00:39:25.830 --> 00:39:26.710
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

801
00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:31.800
<v Speaker 4>but weed has been the best thing that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>happened for that ailment.</v>

802
00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:35.080
<v Speaker 4>Whereas you take Motrin and you can take</v>
<v Speaker 4>Motrin,</v>

803
00:39:35.081 --> 00:39:37.630
<v Speaker 4>but it can give you a terrible song cake</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's really bad.</v>

804
00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:38.823
<v Speaker 4>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's really bad for your liver and you </v>

805
00:39:40.561 --> 00:39:41.770
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're taking like,</v>

806
00:39:41.890 --> 00:39:44.940
<v Speaker 4>just handfuls of mode training,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all those things.</v>

807
00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:45.761
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the same thing,</v>

808
00:39:45.761 --> 00:39:48.270
<v Speaker 4>but it's nonsteroidal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>antiinflammatories.</v>

809
00:39:48.310 --> 00:39:50.350
<v Speaker 4>Those things are super bad for your </v>
<v Speaker 4>body.</v>

810
00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:52.840
<v Speaker 4>But it's interesting that that's what </v>
<v Speaker 4>you would,</v>

811
00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:54.063
<v Speaker 4>you would take as opposed to having weed</v>
<v Speaker 4>legal in all of its different medicinal </v>

812
00:39:58.601 --> 00:40:01.060
<v Speaker 4>facets that can help you with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

813
00:40:01.061 --> 00:40:04.330
<v Speaker 4>the differences obviously there's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychoactive effect is probably unwanted</v>

814
00:40:04.331 --> 00:40:05.164
<v Speaker 4>for a lot of people that take advil.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just want to get rid of the </v>

815
00:40:06.821 --> 00:40:07.870
<v Speaker 4>headache.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't want to trip.</v>

816
00:40:07.871 --> 00:40:11.620
<v Speaker 4>They're fucking balls off CBDS to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

817
00:40:11.621 --> 00:40:12.700
<v Speaker 4>they're great,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're great.</v>

818
00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:13.863
<v Speaker 4>But apparently some people take cbds and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they experienced some sort of a </v>

819
00:40:17.111 --> 00:40:17.944
<v Speaker 4>psychoactive effect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've talked to quite a few people that </v>

820
00:40:19.541 --> 00:40:24.130
<v Speaker 4>say that I don't understand that maybe </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're getting stuff that's like weird,</v>

821
00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:25.490
<v Speaker 4>probably got popped.</v>

822
00:40:25.490 --> 00:40:28.750
<v Speaker 4>And I think that too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think some of the recipes,</v>

823
00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:32.200
<v Speaker 4>like I've definitely gotten edibles that</v>
<v Speaker 4>were duds and you have to.</v>

824
00:40:32.201 --> 00:40:32.940
<v Speaker 4>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

825
00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:34.330
<v Speaker 4>I think they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they miss something,</v>

826
00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:35.433
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's still sort of like a primitive </v>

827
00:40:36.610 --> 00:40:37.443
<v Speaker 4>market.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I think a lot of the companies and </v>

828
00:40:39.341 --> 00:40:41.950
<v Speaker 4>you see some of them like come in and </v>
<v Speaker 4>come out just like boom,</v>

829
00:40:41.951 --> 00:40:42.311
<v Speaker 4>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>boom,</v>

830
00:40:42.311 --> 00:40:45.100
<v Speaker 4>like new restaurants didn't make it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

831
00:40:45.310 --> 00:40:50.310
<v Speaker 4>I think there's definitely a search for </v>
<v Speaker 4>more reliable product in that regard,</v>

832
00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:52.040
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

833
00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:53.140
<v Speaker 4>we're all so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so different.</v>

834
00:40:53.141 --> 00:40:55.460
<v Speaker 4>Like um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know you will react to weeds,</v>

835
00:40:55.470 --> 00:40:56.770
<v Speaker 4>so different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Terrible.</v>

836
00:40:57.540 --> 00:40:59.590
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You might feel like last time we talked,</v>

837
00:40:59.710 --> 00:41:00.543
<v Speaker 4>you told me not to blow up your spot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but at one point you took a thousand </v>

838
00:41:04.030 --> 00:41:05.770
<v Speaker 4>milligrams.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that you have done that?</v>

839
00:41:05.771 --> 00:41:09.430
<v Speaker 4>A couple of insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I take 10 milligrams I'm fucked.</v>

840
00:41:09.870 --> 00:41:11.160
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I can't hang with Joey.</v>

841
00:41:11.410 --> 00:41:14.800
<v Speaker 4>Joey Diaz will take a thousand and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll eat 250 more in front of you and</v>

842
00:41:14.801 --> 00:41:15.634
<v Speaker 4>let that story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were at Coachella and I accidentally </v>

843
00:41:19.511 --> 00:41:23.290
<v Speaker 4>took a 25 milligram jolly rancher </v>
<v Speaker 4>because it was a hard candy.</v>

844
00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:25.570
<v Speaker 4>You don't just bite it in half.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And my friends were like,</v>

845
00:41:25.571 --> 00:41:26.740
<v Speaker 4>you took the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

846
00:41:26.741 --> 00:41:30.190
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I lost my mind watching radiohead.</v>

847
00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:34.070
<v Speaker 4>This is years ago and coincidentally ran</v>
<v Speaker 4>into Clark Jr and I was</v>

848
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:34.730
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

849
00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:37.980
<v Speaker 3>I was like Carrie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

850
00:41:38.090 --> 00:41:40.800
<v Speaker 3>you're fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I was like,</v>

851
00:41:40.801 --> 00:41:40.970
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

852
00:41:40.970 --> 00:41:43.060
<v Speaker 1>just losing my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we,</v>

853
00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:46.370
<v Speaker 1>I found out he was super helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I told you that story,</v>

854
00:41:46.371 --> 00:41:47.204
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you were like,</v>

855
00:41:47.210 --> 00:41:48.920
<v Speaker 1>fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd take 25 milligrams,</v>

856
00:41:48.921 --> 00:41:50.120
<v Speaker 1>go to the movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

857
00:41:50.121 --> 00:41:51.620
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you are very tough.</v>

858
00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:54.920
<v Speaker 1>Well this is the point is there's no </v>
<v Speaker 1>consistency.</v>

859
00:41:54.921 --> 00:41:55.754
<v Speaker 1>Like you get your 25 milligrams and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>also a matter of how much take and how </v>

860
00:41:58.761 --> 00:41:59.840
<v Speaker 1>often take it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

861
00:41:59.930 --> 00:42:01.220
<v Speaker 1>I definitely didn't say it like that.</v>

862
00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:07.240
<v Speaker 3>You're so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You check the tape gentlemen about it,</v>

863
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:14.330
<v Speaker 3>but you like to brag about how much they</v>
<v Speaker 3>could take me included,</v>

864
00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:15.693
<v Speaker 3>like pitch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I take that whole you journey journey </v>

865
00:42:20.690 --> 00:42:24.110
<v Speaker 3>pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joey Diaz is a horrible person though.</v>

866
00:42:24.111 --> 00:42:24.944
<v Speaker 3>Joey will take these Chiba Chews and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he'll take the ones that have 500 </v>

867
00:42:28.791 --> 00:42:33.791
<v Speaker 3>milligrams swap the package for one that</v>
<v Speaker 3>has 75 milligram to somebody.</v>

868
00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:36.433
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he'll laugh because he knows you're </v>

869
00:42:38.151 --> 00:42:40.430
<v Speaker 3>going to live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody lives.</v>

870
00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:41.833
<v Speaker 3>Everybody lives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had a friend because we had a friend </v>

871
00:42:43.101 --> 00:42:43.934
<v Speaker 3>who said</v>

872
00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:49.520
<v Speaker 1>he ate an edible and he slept for two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for 24 hours.</v>

873
00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:53.230
<v Speaker 1>We're not going to say who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we had a friend.</v>

874
00:42:53.410 --> 00:42:54.243
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember what you're talking </v>

875
00:42:54.940 --> 00:42:56.370
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was so high,</v>

876
00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:57.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know who I'm talking about.</v>

877
00:42:57.990 --> 00:42:58.391
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

878
00:42:58.391 --> 00:42:59.320
<v Speaker 1>but it's all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

879
00:42:59.321 --> 00:43:00.154
<v Speaker 1>Well a friend of yours had never had </v>
<v Speaker 1>weed before and someone gave him an </v>

880
00:43:04.391 --> 00:43:08.170
<v Speaker 1>edible and he slept for like 24 hours </v>
<v Speaker 1>and woke up like an entire day later.</v>

881
00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:12.520
<v Speaker 1>If you don't do it all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're not used to it.</v>

882
00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:13.413
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt more high on edibles then I have </v>

883
00:43:16.331 --> 00:43:19.600
<v Speaker 1>like taking mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't take that many mushrooms,</v>

884
00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:22.300
<v Speaker 1>but it's a very intense psychoactive </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

885
00:43:22.301 --> 00:43:24.430
<v Speaker 1>When you take an edible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is obviously.</v>

886
00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:26.230
<v Speaker 1>There's so many times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I apologize in advance,</v>

887
00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:30.130
<v Speaker 1>but your body produces something called </v>
<v Speaker 1>11 hydroxy metabolites process.</v>

888
00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:30.993
<v Speaker 1>When thc is processed by your liver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's five times more psychoactive than </v>

889
00:43:33.521 --> 00:43:34.000
<v Speaker 1>thc.</v>

890
00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:37.000
<v Speaker 1>It's way different drug and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychoactive when you smoke it,</v>

891
00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:39.400
<v Speaker 1>so like when you're smoking pot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're.</v>

892
00:43:39.490 --> 00:43:43.000
<v Speaker 1>Your body's not producing the 11 hydroxy</v>
<v Speaker 1>metabolite,</v>

893
00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:43.933
<v Speaker 1>but when you process it with your liver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body produces this intense </v>

894
00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:52.260
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic drug like you can have when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you eat weed and then close your eyes.</v>

895
00:43:52.541 --> 00:43:57.250
<v Speaker 1>You have some of the craziest fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>visuals that match up there.</v>

896
00:43:57.251 --> 00:44:00.760
<v Speaker 1>As long as you have enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go up right up to everything.</v>

897
00:44:00.790 --> 00:44:03.010
<v Speaker 1>They go right up to mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go,</v>

898
00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:05.940
<v Speaker 1>you can have like these many dmt trips </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you.</v>

899
00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:09.760
<v Speaker 1>I smoked DMT with weed once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was insane.</v>

900
00:44:10.410 --> 00:44:12.670
<v Speaker 1>How about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It changed my life.</v>

901
00:44:13.030 --> 00:44:13.863
<v Speaker 1>When did you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really is a couple of years ago and </v>

902
00:44:17.050 --> 00:44:22.050
<v Speaker 1>the good friend of mine and I took one </v>
<v Speaker 1>hit and it was like zero to 100.</v>

903
00:44:23.651 --> 00:44:26.320
<v Speaker 1>It was just like you exhale and then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>just take off.</v>

904
00:44:26.380 --> 00:44:29.380
<v Speaker 1>And I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd never smoked dmt before and I'm very</v>

905
00:44:29.381 --> 00:44:31.980
<v Speaker 1>sensitive to wheat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was high for two,</v>

906
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:37.010
<v Speaker 1>three hours was so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at one point I was watching,</v>

907
00:44:37.310 --> 00:44:38.143
<v Speaker 1>we were sitting on a balcony and I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching the street and it flipped into </v>

908
00:44:41.281 --> 00:44:43.290
<v Speaker 1>like negative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a photograph,</v>

909
00:44:43.590 --> 00:44:47.710
<v Speaker 1>like the colors changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You smoke the DMT and.</v>

910
00:44:47.711 --> 00:44:50.250
<v Speaker 1>And how many minutes later is this </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening?</v>

911
00:44:50.340 --> 00:44:53.070
<v Speaker 1>This was in about 10 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

912
00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:56.550
<v Speaker 1>So that was when it was most intense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you kept your eyes open?</v>

913
00:44:56.730 --> 00:44:58.470
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should I close my eyes?</v>

914
00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:00.320
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

915
00:45:00.330 --> 00:45:05.310
<v Speaker 1>tell me how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sounds like you took a small dose of you</v>

916
00:45:05.311 --> 00:45:06.980
<v Speaker 1>took one hit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

917
00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:09.180
<v Speaker 1>I took a couple heads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my first hit,</v>

918
00:45:09.181 --> 00:45:10.014
<v Speaker 1>it was just like literally like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like star wars when it just goes </v>

919
00:45:12.331 --> 00:45:14.040
<v Speaker 1>into warp speed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

920
00:45:14.930 --> 00:45:16.650
<v Speaker 1>like it was insane.</v>

921
00:45:16.650 --> 00:45:17.483
<v Speaker 1>Dante's got a weird threshold thing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>happens and it's telling me every three </v>

922
00:45:20.701 --> 00:45:22.950
<v Speaker 1>hits in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happened to something about three,</v>

923
00:45:23.370 --> 00:45:27.360
<v Speaker 1>three hits in is when reality dissolves </v>
<v Speaker 1>for most people.</v>

924
00:45:27.361 --> 00:45:28.710
<v Speaker 1>That's what they say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three hits.</v>

925
00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:31.920
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you took like one or two,</v>

926
00:45:31.921 --> 00:45:34.470
<v Speaker 1>you get crazy visuals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get weird freaky stuff.</v>

927
00:45:34.490 --> 00:45:36.910
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you don't go to the alien dementia I</v>

928
00:45:36.911 --> 00:45:37.531
<v Speaker 1>saw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

929
00:45:37.531 --> 00:45:37.861
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

930
00:45:37.861 --> 00:45:39.360
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I totally did.</v>

931
00:45:39.361 --> 00:45:40.081
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You took enough.</v>

932
00:45:40.081 --> 00:45:43.340
<v Speaker 1>So did you close your eyes while you </v>
<v Speaker 1>were there or did you have them open?</v>

933
00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:44.653
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was nighttime so I could see the </v>

934
00:45:46.381 --> 00:45:49.710
<v Speaker 1>stars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at one point I went completely deaf.</v>

935
00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:51.413
<v Speaker 1>All the sound just went and I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching a moving street and I couldn't </v>

936
00:45:55.291 --> 00:45:57.360
<v Speaker 1>hear anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was intense.</v>

937
00:45:57.390 --> 00:45:58.710
<v Speaker 1>How high up were you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A.</v>

938
00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:01.620
<v Speaker 1>Just a couple of stories to worried </v>
<v Speaker 1>about freaking out and trying to fly.</v>

939
00:46:01.940 --> 00:46:02.521
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

940
00:46:02.521 --> 00:46:03.030
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

941
00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:04.350
<v Speaker 1>I was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was on the,</v>

942
00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:05.303
<v Speaker 1>on the ride.</v>

943
00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:08.010
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell me more.</v>

944
00:46:08.730 --> 00:46:09.563
<v Speaker 1>Fear the big fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like someone taking a psychedelic </v>

945
00:46:11.850 --> 00:46:14.010
<v Speaker 1>balcony.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Bill Hicks used to have a bit about</v>

946
00:46:14.011 --> 00:46:16.890
<v Speaker 1>that young man on acid thought he could </v>
<v Speaker 1>fly,</v>

947
00:46:17.150 --> 00:46:19.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>left to tragically to his death.</v>

948
00:46:19.150 --> 00:46:20.400
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what a tragedy.</v>

949
00:46:20.430 --> 00:46:21.870
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what a Dick still here?</v>

950
00:46:21.871 --> 00:46:23.430
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did he thought he could fly?</v>

951
00:46:23.431 --> 00:46:24.960
<v Speaker 1>Why did he take off from the ground </v>
<v Speaker 1>first?</v>

952
00:46:26.490 --> 00:46:30.090
<v Speaker 1>Because we just lost a moron.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's awful.</v>

953
00:46:30.330 --> 00:46:31.690
<v Speaker 1>Oh boys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>

954
00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:39.620
<v Speaker 1>And then he had a positive drug store,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you never do here.</v>

955
00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:42.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is interesting.</v>

956
00:46:42.031 --> 00:46:42.864
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like to say that the news is </v>

957
00:46:43.531 --> 00:46:44.364
<v Speaker 1>fake because it's not fake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like they're doing the best they </v>

958
00:46:47.251 --> 00:46:48.084
<v Speaker 1>can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They vet themselves the best they can </v>

959
00:46:48.871 --> 00:46:51.810
<v Speaker 1>and they definitely fuck up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely people get ambitious,</v>

960
00:46:52.260 --> 00:46:53.093
<v Speaker 1>but it is kind of interesting that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>only tell you like sanction things like </v>

961
00:46:57.691 --> 00:46:58.524
<v Speaker 1>you're never going to see like a whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>Fox News article on the benefits of </v>

962
00:47:02.881 --> 00:47:03.714
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how it could change your </v>

963
00:47:04.651 --> 00:47:05.484
<v Speaker 1>consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how Suzanne smoke pot with Duncan </v>

964
00:47:08.431 --> 00:47:13.431
<v Speaker 1>trussell with dmt laced in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it could be,</v>

965
00:47:13.921 --> 00:47:14.754
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean take mushrooms with Duncan wants </v>

966
00:47:16.141 --> 00:47:18.000
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it was amazing.</v>

967
00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:22.710
<v Speaker 1>It was the first time I'd ever really </v>
<v Speaker 1>been high on mushrooms.</v>

968
00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:28.140
<v Speaker 1>I saw my grandfather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's intense.</v>

969
00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:29.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should talk that.</v>

970
00:47:29.411 --> 00:47:29.980
<v Speaker 1>Another time</v>

971
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:34.980
<v Speaker 2>I saw my grandfather once on weed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ate them that a bone in her dream.</v>

972
00:47:35.860 --> 00:47:39.820
<v Speaker 2>And that dream was really intense and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was talking to my grandfather.</v>

973
00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:43.900
<v Speaker 2>It was really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I hadn't seen him in forever,</v>

974
00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:44.793
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he died when I was who I was in my </v>

975
00:47:49.001 --> 00:47:51.560
<v Speaker 2>twenties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And feel real.</v>

976
00:47:52.210 --> 00:47:53.043
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you guys spend a lot of time </v>

977
00:47:54.101 --> 00:47:56.020
<v Speaker 2>together?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

978
00:47:56.021 --> 00:47:56.950
<v Speaker 2>we did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

979
00:47:56.951 --> 00:47:57.960
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

980
00:47:58.990 --> 00:48:01.090
<v Speaker 2>he used to take me fishing and stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

981
00:48:01.091 --> 00:48:05.550
<v Speaker 2>He was a really nice guy and just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

982
00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:08.260
<v Speaker 2>took care of my grandmother for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>last,</v>

983
00:48:08.261 --> 00:48:11.020
<v Speaker 2>like 12 years of her life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She had a stroke and then he had to take</v>

984
00:48:11.021 --> 00:48:13.870
<v Speaker 2>care of her for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She had an aneurism.</v>

985
00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:15.641
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

986
00:48:15.641 --> 00:48:16.474
<v Speaker 2>And I lived with them at that time </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'd moved from Boston to New </v>

987
00:48:20.410 --> 00:48:22.000
<v Speaker 2>York.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never placed a stay,</v>

988
00:48:22.330 --> 00:48:23.163
<v Speaker 2>so I live with my grandfather and my </v>
<v Speaker 2>grandmother in New Jersey and it was </v>

989
00:48:25.150 --> 00:48:26.860
<v Speaker 2>super dark time.</v>

990
00:48:27.610 --> 00:48:30.970
<v Speaker 2>But how old were you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A 24.</v>

991
00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:32.343
<v Speaker 2>Somewhere around then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it made me realize like really </v>

992
00:48:35.921 --> 00:48:36.754
<v Speaker 2>intensely that this life does not last </v>
<v Speaker 2>like in then you have to really be </v>

993
00:48:43.331 --> 00:48:48.331
<v Speaker 2>appreciative of health in your movement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your ability to move and your ability to</v>

994
00:48:48.341 --> 00:48:50.920
<v Speaker 2>experience things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it just seems so.</v>

995
00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:51.993
<v Speaker 2>It seems like such a given and because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's such a given and we get wrapped up </v>

996
00:48:55.121 --> 00:48:56.910
<v Speaker 2>in so many different things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's easy,</v>

997
00:48:57.040 --> 00:49:00.520
<v Speaker 2>super easy to lose touch with that to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>happy.</v>

998
00:49:00.521 --> 00:49:01.354
<v Speaker 2>Like I was talking to a really good </v>
<v Speaker 2>friend of mine who's going through a </v>

999
00:49:02.861 --> 00:49:06.220
<v Speaker 2>divorce and he started getting all </v>
<v Speaker 2>bummed out about it and this and that.</v>

1000
00:49:06.221 --> 00:49:07.180
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look man,</v>

1001
00:49:07.210 --> 00:49:09.730
<v Speaker 2>you are so lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're happy.</v>

1002
00:49:09.731 --> 00:49:11.830
<v Speaker 2>You're healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're alive.</v>

1003
00:49:11.831 --> 00:49:14.170
<v Speaker 2>You have a bunch of great friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're going to be fine.</v>

1004
00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:15.760
<v Speaker 2>Like if this is all gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be fine.</v>

1005
00:49:15.761 --> 00:49:16.594
<v Speaker 2>Like it's just like a little journey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to go through it and it's </v>

1006
00:49:18.221 --> 00:49:21.160
<v Speaker 2>all in like how you look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how you approach this journey,</v>

1007
00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:22.990
<v Speaker 2>how are you going to come out of it on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the other end,</v>

1008
00:49:23.470 --> 00:49:24.303
<v Speaker 2>but being a young guy and living with my</v>
<v Speaker 2>grandmother when she was dying and my </v>

1009
00:49:28.151 --> 00:49:28.984
<v Speaker 2>grandfather,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we to take care of her and seeing the </v>

1010
00:49:30.221 --> 00:49:32.180
<v Speaker 2>bolt of them like struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

1011
00:49:32.830 --> 00:49:35.140
<v Speaker 2>it was intense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can I ask you a question?</v>

1012
00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:36.420
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

1013
00:49:36.420 --> 00:49:38.160
<v Speaker 4>When you feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1014
00:49:38.220 --> 00:49:41.730
<v Speaker 4>when you had this psychedelic experience</v>
<v Speaker 4>where you saw your grandfather like does</v>

1015
00:49:41.731 --> 00:49:42.564
<v Speaker 4>that to you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that like a real experience of him </v>

1016
00:49:47.011 --> 00:49:49.860
<v Speaker 4>being somewhere else in communicating </v>
<v Speaker 4>with you or.</v>

1017
00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:50.743
<v Speaker 2>It's probably just an ego trip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably just me thinking that I </v>

1018
00:49:53.631 --> 00:49:56.780
<v Speaker 2>can recreate my memory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was what was interesting about as</v>

1019
00:49:56.781 --> 00:50:00.170
<v Speaker 2>the memories were so intense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were so realistic.</v>

1020
00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:03.350
<v Speaker 2>They were like my grandfather,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he used to talk and like he used to</v>

1021
00:50:03.351 --> 00:50:04.850
<v Speaker 2>behave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was always a very,</v>

1022
00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:06.133
<v Speaker 2>very gentle man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A very gentle guy with a very easy way </v>

1023
00:50:10.701 --> 00:50:12.260
<v Speaker 2>about him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he was a.</v>

1024
00:50:12.261 --> 00:50:15.740
<v Speaker 2>It was a really interesting guy when he </v>
<v Speaker 2>was like that in the dream it was,</v>

1025
00:50:15.770 --> 00:50:18.230
<v Speaker 2>he was that guy and the dream who makes </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense to,</v>

1026
00:50:18.231 --> 00:50:21.320
<v Speaker 2>if you go through a really impactful </v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

1027
00:50:21.321 --> 00:50:24.770
<v Speaker 2>it just digs those grooves deep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure in your brain.</v>

1028
00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:25.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>

1029
00:50:25.790 --> 00:50:26.623
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1030
00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:27.793
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had it once with Phil Hartman to </v>

1031
00:50:28.940 --> 00:50:32.780
<v Speaker 2>superintendents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Phil Hartman womb was super intense.</v>

1032
00:50:33.140 --> 00:50:36.830
<v Speaker 2>It was years after he died,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like maybe more than 10.</v>

1033
00:50:37.010 --> 00:50:37.843
<v Speaker 2>And in the dream he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sitting in a lawn chair and somehow </v>

1034
00:50:44.421 --> 00:50:45.254
<v Speaker 2>or another he was telling me what life </v>
<v Speaker 2>was like after his wife had killed </v>

1035
00:50:50.091 --> 00:50:52.370
<v Speaker 2>himself or killed him and they killed </v>
<v Speaker 2>herself.</v>

1036
00:50:52.910 --> 00:50:53.743
<v Speaker 2>It was a really intense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like somehow or another I was </v>

1037
00:50:57.711 --> 00:51:00.650
<v Speaker 2>talking to him from this next stage of </v>
<v Speaker 2>existence,</v>

1038
00:51:00.860 --> 00:51:01.693
<v Speaker 2>but the next stage of existence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't heaven and it wasn't the DMT </v>

1039
00:51:04.701 --> 00:51:06.500
<v Speaker 2>dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like a picnic.</v>

1040
00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:09.290
<v Speaker 2>It was like there was a lawn and it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1041
00:51:09.350 --> 00:51:11.390
<v Speaker 2>it was like bunch of people hanging out </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he had a.</v>

1042
00:51:12.350 --> 00:51:15.980
<v Speaker 2>It was just laughing and joking around </v>
<v Speaker 2>and being jovial about things.</v>

1043
00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:18.080
<v Speaker 2>And he was just talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

1044
00:51:18.081 --> 00:51:20.180
<v Speaker 2>we talked about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a human.</v>

1045
00:51:20.181 --> 00:51:21.860
<v Speaker 2>The wife after she shot him and killed </v>
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>

1046
00:51:21.861 --> 00:51:24.310
<v Speaker 2>he was like joking around in my dream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

1047
00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:24.600
<v Speaker 2>we had that.</v>

1048
00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:26.230
<v Speaker 2>We had to have a conversation about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1049
00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:28.290
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

1050
00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:30.320
<v Speaker 2>Was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was so crazy.</v>

1051
00:51:30.321 --> 00:51:32.050
<v Speaker 2>It was so intense because it was so </v>
<v Speaker 2>real.</v>

1052
00:51:32.090 --> 00:51:34.030
<v Speaker 2>It was him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1053
00:51:34.220 --> 00:51:38.000
<v Speaker 2>he fell backwards in his chair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like laughing,</v>

1054
00:51:38.350 --> 00:51:39.183
<v Speaker 2>fell backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is Chair almost like a prat fall and </v>

1055
00:51:41.871 --> 00:51:45.260
<v Speaker 2>then he was gone and then the dream was </v>
<v Speaker 2>gone and then it just,</v>

1056
00:51:45.290 --> 00:51:47.780
<v Speaker 2>it all went away and I woke up because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was so intense.</v>

1057
00:51:47.781 --> 00:51:49.820
<v Speaker 2>I woke up and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

1058
00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:52.220
<v Speaker 2>That really felt like I was talking to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Phil.</v>

1059
00:51:52.490 --> 00:51:54.500
<v Speaker 2>Like it didn't feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a memory.</v>

1060
00:51:54.530 --> 00:51:56.750
<v Speaker 2>It really felt like I was talking to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Phil.</v>

1061
00:51:57.290 --> 00:51:58.160
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is that?</v>

1062
00:51:58.161 --> 00:51:59.990
<v Speaker 2>Is that an ego trip?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that you imagine</v>

1063
00:52:00.710 --> 00:52:01.990
<v Speaker 4>memory stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1064
00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:03.390
<v Speaker 4>do you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are you all in?</v>

1065
00:52:04.050 --> 00:52:06.480
<v Speaker 4>I'm in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm in because I've had experience.</v>

1066
00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:07.020
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1067
00:52:07.020 --> 00:52:07.853
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a lot of bullshit with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You need to be skeptical from the </v>

1068
00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:13.710
<v Speaker 4>external people that try to tell you </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff,</v>

1069
00:52:14.190 --> 00:52:19.110
<v Speaker 4>but I've definitely had people help me </v>
<v Speaker 4>understand what all that shit means when</v>

1070
00:52:19.111 --> 00:52:22.620
<v Speaker 4>I've had dreams like that with my </v>
<v Speaker 4>deceased relatives.</v>

1071
00:52:22.621 --> 00:52:24.930
<v Speaker 4>And they told me things and then they </v>
<v Speaker 4>happened in.</v>

1072
00:52:25.170 --> 00:52:26.220
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it could be your ego,</v>

1073
00:52:26.221 --> 00:52:29.220
<v Speaker 4>but I like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that makes it a less</v>

1074
00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:32.300
<v Speaker 2>real though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's your ego or your mind,</v>

1075
00:52:32.660 --> 00:52:33.493
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>creating a scenario with a loved one or </v>

1076
00:52:34.641 --> 00:52:35.360
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's this.</v>

1077
00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:39.590
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's less real than the </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea of this spirit reembody being,</v>

1078
00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:41.360
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1079
00:52:41.430 --> 00:52:42.560
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>

1080
00:52:42.620 --> 00:52:44.160
<v Speaker 2>some sort of physical form or whatever.</v>

1081
00:52:44.610 --> 00:52:46.980
<v Speaker 4>I think it's both.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're both kind of valid.</v>

1082
00:52:47.250 --> 00:52:47.890
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1083
00:52:47.890 --> 00:52:48.723
<v Speaker 4>it's energy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's an exchange of energy and </v>

1084
00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:56.480
<v Speaker 4>we've definitely been in places where we</v>
<v Speaker 4>felt like not alone,</v>

1085
00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:57.581
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we,</v>

1086
00:52:57.581 --> 00:52:58.980
<v Speaker 4>and we weren't high.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were,</v>

1087
00:52:59.100 --> 00:53:00.750
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have those moments where like,</v>

1088
00:53:00.751 --> 00:53:01.584
<v Speaker 4>your instincts and your intuition are </v>
<v Speaker 4>like aware of external things that you </v>

1089
00:53:06.241 --> 00:53:09.000
<v Speaker 4>can't see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you can feel and maybe maybe you can</v>

1090
00:53:09.001 --> 00:53:11.520
<v Speaker 4>see him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen a ghost.</v>

1091
00:53:11.930 --> 00:53:12.890
<v Speaker 2>His dress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you just said,</v>

1092
00:53:12.891 --> 00:53:14.540
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a difference,</v>

1093
00:53:14.570 --> 00:53:16.340
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is a difference we can see because</v>

1094
00:53:16.341 --> 00:53:18.140
<v Speaker 2>you're one of them is your imagination </v>
<v Speaker 2>and one of them,</v>

1095
00:53:18.141 --> 00:53:21.140
<v Speaker 2>as you're talking to a gross,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a huge difference because one of</v>

1096
00:53:21.141 --> 00:53:23.180
<v Speaker 2>them that means go surreal or the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>

1097
00:53:23.181 --> 00:53:26.670
<v Speaker 2>it just means your imagination is real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are absolutely a 100 percent aware</v>

1098
00:53:26.671 --> 00:53:27.091
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1099
00:53:27.091 --> 00:53:29.250
<v Speaker 2>So we know people have ridiculous </v>
<v Speaker 2>imaginations.</v>

1100
00:53:29.251 --> 00:53:31.140
<v Speaker 2>They dream and imagine things </v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly.</v>

1101
00:53:31.590 --> 00:53:34.440
<v Speaker 2>So there is a big difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Share two of them because one of them,</v>

1102
00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:39.920
<v Speaker 2>one of them gives you a view into </v>
<v Speaker 2>mystical world that doesn't,</v>

1103
00:53:41.310 --> 00:53:46.170
<v Speaker 2>doesn't end in the eyes of science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't seem to make sense,</v>

1104
00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:48.440
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't seem to want exists.</v>

1105
00:53:48.450 --> 00:53:49.283
<v Speaker 2>If there's another world where people </v>
<v Speaker 2>can come back from the dead and talk to </v>

1106
00:53:51.301 --> 00:53:52.134
<v Speaker 2>you and have conversations with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one of the arguments that I've </v>

1107
00:53:54.541 --> 00:53:55.374
<v Speaker 2>always used with psychedelic drugs is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that if you feel like in a in a </v>

1108
00:53:59.930 --> 00:54:00.763
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you went to heaven and had a </v>

1109
00:54:03.751 --> 00:54:04.584
<v Speaker 2>conversation with God or you went to </v>
<v Speaker 2>another dimension and talk to the </v>

1110
00:54:06.781 --> 00:54:09.700
<v Speaker 2>infinite wisdom that controls the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1111
00:54:09.830 --> 00:54:11.700
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cells of the universe.</v>

1112
00:54:12.150 --> 00:54:16.350
<v Speaker 2>If you did do that or if you took the </v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs and felt like you did that,</v>

1113
00:54:16.351 --> 00:54:18.990
<v Speaker 2>it's the same experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the difference.</v>

1114
00:54:19.290 --> 00:54:20.123
<v Speaker 2>It's like I don't know if God's real and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the fuck happens when </v>

1115
00:54:22.061 --> 00:54:25.760
<v Speaker 2>he takes psychedelic drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but God damn it feels similar like it.</v>

1116
00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:26.753
<v Speaker 2>There's moments where you have intent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic trips where you really do </v>

1117
00:54:30.241 --> 00:54:34.770
<v Speaker 2>believe you're in the presence of like </v>
<v Speaker 2>this pure wisdom and pure love that sees</v>

1118
00:54:34.771 --> 00:54:37.780
<v Speaker 2>you in a way that is undeniable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't argue it.</v>

1119
00:54:37.860 --> 00:54:38.611
<v Speaker 4>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1120
00:54:38.611 --> 00:54:39.444
<v Speaker 4>I think sometimes it's your ego.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes it's some weird shit in your </v>

1121
00:54:41.491 --> 00:54:43.200
<v Speaker 4>brain and sometimes I think it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's.</v>

1122
00:54:43.350 --> 00:54:45.090
<v Speaker 4>It's very complicated.</v>

1123
00:54:45.220 --> 00:54:47.830
<v Speaker 2>It is complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My point is the same experience.</v>

1124
00:54:47.980 --> 00:54:51.700
<v Speaker 2>If you're talking to God or if you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking to your imagination that creates</v>

1125
00:54:51.701 --> 00:54:54.790
<v Speaker 2>this God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's for that brief moment.</v>

1126
00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:56.193
<v Speaker 2>In those 15 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the same experience and I don't </v>

1127
00:54:58.691 --> 00:55:01.660
<v Speaker 2>know if that's enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's something like,</v>

1128
00:55:01.661 --> 00:55:04.960
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what your.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your old time on earth is just time,</v>

1129
00:55:04.961 --> 00:55:05.980
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your time on earth.</v>

1130
00:55:05.981 --> 00:55:07.780
<v Speaker 2>It's just you have a limited finite </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount.</v>

1131
00:55:07.990 --> 00:55:10.480
<v Speaker 2>He got 100 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're fucking super lucky guy,</v>

1132
00:55:10.540 --> 00:55:12.730
<v Speaker 2>good genes and that's a wrap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1133
00:55:12.731 --> 00:55:14.710
<v Speaker 2>So this is just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have this whole time thing,</v>

1134
00:55:15.010 --> 00:55:18.340
<v Speaker 2>but during those 15 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a small amount of time,</v>

1135
00:55:18.341 --> 00:55:21.580
<v Speaker 2>but the whole life small during those 15</v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes,</v>

1136
00:55:21.850 --> 00:55:26.260
<v Speaker 2>you are absolutely experiencing </v>
<v Speaker 2>something divine.</v>

1137
00:55:26.520 --> 00:55:27.353
<v Speaker 2>Now is out in your imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that you finding some portal to </v>

1138
00:55:31.421 --> 00:55:32.254
<v Speaker 2>another dimension?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that the reason why your brain </v>

1139
00:55:34.241 --> 00:55:35.074
<v Speaker 2>produces these chemicals in the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>place is because we transitioned during </v>

1140
00:55:37.961 --> 00:55:40.650
<v Speaker 2>the time of death into this new realm?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that it?</v>

1141
00:55:40.900 --> 00:55:43.360
<v Speaker 2>But if he doesn't accept what divinity </v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

1142
00:55:43.361 --> 00:55:47.170
<v Speaker 2>includes all of that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he gets to be both right?</v>

1143
00:55:47.540 --> 00:55:48.373
<v Speaker 2>We sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean like there's a real problem </v>

1144
00:55:50.351 --> 00:55:52.780
<v Speaker 2>with defining something that you just </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't define.</v>

1145
00:55:52.990 --> 00:55:55.330
<v Speaker 2>Like the whole problem with psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 2>trips.</v>

1146
00:55:55.331 --> 00:55:56.164
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like free.</v>

1147
00:55:56.170 --> 00:55:57.003
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you guys feel this way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For me it's always like whenever I tell </v>

1148
00:55:59.711 --> 00:56:03.250
<v Speaker 2>somebody about them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like why even use words,</v>

1149
00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:04.900
<v Speaker 2>like the words don't work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1150
00:56:05.310 --> 00:56:07.420
<v Speaker 2>The Not enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not enough.</v>

1151
00:56:07.421 --> 00:56:08.900
<v Speaker 2>You could scramble them together and </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

1152
00:56:08.901 --> 00:56:09.050
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1153
00:56:09.050 --> 00:56:09.883
<v Speaker 4>perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And screaming from the rooftops to it </v>

1154
00:56:11.451 --> 00:56:15.220
<v Speaker 4>can almost like demean the experience or</v>
<v Speaker 4>diminish.</v>

1155
00:56:16.050 --> 00:56:16.883
<v Speaker 4>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well that's where we're pushing against </v>

1156
00:56:18.411 --> 00:56:21.170
<v Speaker 4>the limits of language,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1157
00:56:21.190 --> 00:56:24.220
<v Speaker 4>and that's why I think there's such a </v>
<v Speaker 4>wide</v>

1158
00:56:24.250 --> 00:56:25.083
<v Speaker 5>array of people's theories and beliefs </v>
<v Speaker 5>and thoughts and they're all valid </v>

1159
00:56:27.851 --> 00:56:31.270
<v Speaker 5>because we don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's no agreed upon language to say,</v>

1160
00:56:31.271 --> 00:56:32.104
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is how we all feel and this is how </v>

1161
00:56:32.831 --> 00:56:33.664
<v Speaker 5>we're doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1162
00:56:33.700 --> 00:56:34.880
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's similar,</v>

1163
00:56:35.050 --> 00:56:35.883
<v Speaker 5>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I always go back to music with this </v>

1164
00:56:37.361 --> 00:56:38.194
<v Speaker 5>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's a similar pathway and trend </v>

1165
00:56:41.111 --> 00:56:41.944
<v Speaker 5>in music where people are constantly </v>
<v Speaker 5>redefining the language of it and you </v>

1166
00:56:45.011 --> 00:56:46.600
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a kind of a mainstream,</v>

1167
00:56:46.820 --> 00:56:48.370
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>openness to that are,</v>

1168
00:56:48.371 --> 00:56:49.204
<v Speaker 5>there isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the idea that the point is the </v>

1169
00:56:51.071 --> 00:56:52.630
<v Speaker 5>language is dynamic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1170
00:56:52.631 --> 00:56:53.464
<v Speaker 5>and it goes on to continuously try and </v>
<v Speaker 5>express something that's kind of </v>

1171
00:56:56.861 --> 00:56:57.694
<v Speaker 5>inexpressible and that's why it acts as </v>
<v Speaker 5>a magnet for people suck because they </v>

1172
00:57:01.031 --> 00:57:01.930
<v Speaker 5>say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1173
00:57:02.500 --> 00:57:03.333
<v Speaker 5>this is kind of our pathway of </v>
<v Speaker 5>experimentation to understand these </v>

1174
00:57:07.990 --> 00:57:08.780
<v Speaker 5>phenomena.</v>

1175
00:57:08.780 --> 00:57:09.613
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like the fast food of music a </v>

1176
00:57:11.151 --> 00:57:11.984
<v Speaker 1>little bit and then there's some more </v>
<v Speaker 1>obscure like restaurants off the beaten </v>

1177
00:57:14.931 --> 00:57:17.420
<v Speaker 1>path that you've never tasted anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

1178
00:57:17.480 --> 00:57:19.790
<v Speaker 1>And they're developing the vocabulary </v>
<v Speaker 1>the most.</v>

1179
00:57:19.791 --> 00:57:22.280
<v Speaker 1>People like that fucking tastes gross.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not eating a cricket,</v>

1180
00:57:22.310 --> 00:57:23.540
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1181
00:57:23.690 --> 00:57:24.523
<v Speaker 1>but in 50 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that that vocabulary kind of </v>

1182
00:57:27.201 --> 00:57:30.020
<v Speaker 1>seeps its way in if it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's value.</v>

1183
00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:32.930
<v Speaker 1>I always felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you guys are the musicians,</v>

1184
00:57:32.931 --> 00:57:33.764
<v Speaker 1>but I always felt like what music sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of is almost like a vessel that the </v>

1185
00:57:37.611 --> 00:57:38.444
<v Speaker 1>artist filled with emotion and with like</v>
<v Speaker 1>passion and it's almost like it doesn't </v>

1186
00:57:43.251 --> 00:57:45.590
<v Speaker 1>even matter what the words are </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes.</v>

1187
00:57:45.650 --> 00:57:46.483
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it does because those words </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the feeling behind them enhance the </v>

1188
00:57:48.681 --> 00:57:50.780
<v Speaker 1>song.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like Voodoo child,</v>

1189
00:57:50.810 --> 00:57:51.643
<v Speaker 1>perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's like a lot of the lyrics </v>

1190
00:57:55.311 --> 00:57:58.160
<v Speaker 1>are particularly profound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the data was born.</v>

1191
00:57:58.410 --> 00:58:01.750
<v Speaker 1>Say the moon turned all the lyrics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just know the feeling.</v>

1192
00:58:02.990 --> 00:58:04.430
<v Speaker 1>Feel the song.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1193
00:58:04.431 --> 00:58:06.710
<v Speaker 1>It's just about being a bad mother </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucker.</v>

1194
00:58:06.711 --> 00:58:08.330
<v Speaker 1>I was born a bad motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitch.</v>

1195
00:58:09.390 --> 00:58:10.223
<v Speaker 1>He was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't lying and argue that staring </v>

1196
00:58:13.311 --> 00:58:14.144
<v Speaker 1>me in the eye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say that moving out of the night I </v>

1197
00:58:15.981 --> 00:58:17.810
<v Speaker 1>was born.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's not profound,</v>

1198
00:58:17.990 --> 00:58:18.823
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you hear him say it with that </v>

1199
00:58:21.171 --> 00:58:23.450
<v Speaker 1>guitar behind it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with those emotions,</v>

1200
00:58:23.451 --> 00:58:25.740
<v Speaker 1>it carries that song.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1201
00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:26.793
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and what's,</v>

1202
00:58:26.840 --> 00:58:29.140
<v Speaker 5>what's profound is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is the,</v>

1203
00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:32.110
<v Speaker 5>it's part of a lineage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

1204
00:58:32.380 --> 00:58:36.000
<v Speaker 5>That's a proclamation and that's part of</v>
<v Speaker 5>blues music and as part of African music</v>

1205
00:58:36.001 --> 00:58:37.480
<v Speaker 5>and it's part of all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You just like,</v>

1206
00:58:37.630 --> 00:58:40.840
<v Speaker 5>I'm a fucking man or woman or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm a human boom.</v>

1207
00:58:41.020 --> 00:58:41.853
<v Speaker 5>Here it is.</v>

1208
00:58:41.970 --> 00:58:43.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's more than that with him.</v>

1209
00:58:43.441 --> 00:58:45.270
<v Speaker 1>When he's saying he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a Voodoo child.</v>

1210
00:58:45.271 --> 00:58:47.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's basically claiming some </v>
<v Speaker 1>Robert Johnson type shit.</v>

1211
00:58:48.420 --> 00:58:51.330
<v Speaker 1>That night I was born,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the moon turned a fire red,</v>

1212
00:58:52.140 --> 00:58:54.330
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did he write that song?</v>

1213
00:58:54.331 --> 00:58:55.610
<v Speaker 1>Are we certain who?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Buddhist.</v>

1214
00:58:55.620 --> 00:59:00.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who wrote it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a watch watchtower,</v>

1215
00:59:00.661 --> 00:59:01.494
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's about.</v>

1216
00:59:01.590 --> 00:59:02.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this,</v>

1217
00:59:02.750 --> 00:59:03.421
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause he,</v>

1218
00:59:03.421 --> 00:59:04.320
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1219
00:59:04.370 --> 00:59:06.980
<v Speaker 1>his grandmother was a native American so</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has all this,</v>

1220
00:59:07.050 --> 00:59:07.883
<v Speaker 1>like there's two versions to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>version that's like the real bluesy </v>

1221
00:59:13.501 --> 00:59:15.810
<v Speaker 1>version of Voodoo child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1222
00:59:15.811 --> 00:59:17.700
<v Speaker 1>there's the Voodoo child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slight return.</v>

1223
00:59:17.800 --> 00:59:22.800
<v Speaker 1>Then there's that other version which is</v>
<v Speaker 1>much more or much more guitar driven.</v>

1224
00:59:25.470 --> 00:59:27.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he,</v>

1225
00:59:27.770 --> 00:59:30.200
<v Speaker 1>like guitar sounds is a perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1226
00:59:30.210 --> 00:59:31.043
<v Speaker 1>Gary Clark Jr is a perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when he came and played with you </v>

1227
00:59:34.641 --> 00:59:37.490
<v Speaker 1>guys on stage and I saw you guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>downtown a few months back.</v>

1228
00:59:38.090 --> 00:59:39.500
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he gets on stage,</v>

1229
00:59:39.590 --> 00:59:43.490
<v Speaker 1>his sound is Gary Clark Jr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know what I'm saying?</v>

1230
00:59:43.850 --> 00:59:46.310
<v Speaker 1>Like you guys were saying in midnight </v>
<v Speaker 1>rider,</v>

1231
00:59:46.311 --> 00:59:49.270
<v Speaker 1>which was fucking amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just plug in.</v>

1232
00:59:49.300 --> 00:59:49.810
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he.</v>

1233
00:59:49.810 --> 00:59:50.643
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just took my guitar playing trading </v>

1234
00:59:52.420 --> 00:59:53.253
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that sound is like a sound that you </v>

1235
00:59:56.840 --> 00:59:59.710
<v Speaker 1>instantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like stevie ray vaughn had it hendricks.</v>

1236
00:59:59.800 --> 01:00:00.633
<v Speaker 1>They'll get a sale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You instantly recognize one of his </v>

1237
01:00:03.261 --> 01:00:05.540
<v Speaker 1>riffs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>

1238
01:00:05.570 --> 01:00:07.100
<v Speaker 1>How does someone do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1239
01:00:07.150 --> 01:00:11.040
<v Speaker 1>Because it's talking about as far as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary to say,</v>

1240
01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:14.180
<v Speaker 1>and maybe this happens in fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I imagined it does,</v>

1241
01:00:14.210 --> 01:00:16.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have technIques or whatever,</v>

1242
01:00:16.491 --> 01:00:18.710
<v Speaker 1>that they slowly turned into their own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh sure.</v>

1243
01:00:19.190 --> 01:00:21.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what makes them well in their</v>

1244
01:00:21.621 --> 01:00:24.350
<v Speaker 1>derivative of a lot of things have a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of different techniques.</v>

1245
01:00:24.351 --> 01:00:26.060
<v Speaker 1>So then you kind of have this like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1246
01:00:26.550 --> 01:00:28.460
<v Speaker 1>at least for music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll speak for myself.</v>

1247
01:00:28.461 --> 01:00:32.240
<v Speaker 1>I just feel like I have this like garble</v>
<v Speaker 1>of stuff that just when people are like,</v>

1248
01:00:32.241 --> 01:00:32.930
<v Speaker 1>what are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

1249
01:00:32.930 --> 01:00:36.350
<v Speaker 1>how would you describe your sound?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so awkward because you're Like,</v>

1250
01:00:36.530 --> 01:00:38.800
<v Speaker 3>I sound just like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1251
01:00:38.820 --> 01:00:43.820
<v Speaker 3>There's really can't make it sound like </v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't do this.</v>

1252
01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:50.660
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't ask me that question.</v>

1253
01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:52.880
<v Speaker 3>What kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what kind of comedy are you?</v>

1254
01:00:52.890 --> 01:00:57.170
<v Speaker 3>Joe rogen show last week where a guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>asked me to make him laugh.</v>

1255
01:00:57.470 --> 01:00:59.870
<v Speaker 3>Oh fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

1256
01:00:59.871 --> 01:01:04.871
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's ridiculous.</v>

1257
01:01:05.340 --> 01:01:07.770
<v Speaker 3>So when someone calls up on the phone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're saying,</v>

1258
01:01:07.771 --> 01:01:09.110
<v Speaker 3>are you like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sing me a song?</v>

1259
01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:13.370
<v Speaker 3>it's really good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's hear you sing.</v>

1260
01:01:18.430 --> 01:01:19.263
<v Speaker 3>it's humbling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's super humbling because it's like </v>

1261
01:01:21.140 --> 01:01:22.790
<v Speaker 3>sometimes we've.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why's it humbling?</v>

1262
01:01:22.791 --> 01:01:24.620
<v Speaker 3>You're talking to a twat?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1263
01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:25.713
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're talking to someone who doesn't </v>

1264
01:01:26.091 --> 01:01:28.330
<v Speaker 3>understand why they're being a twat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

1265
01:01:28.430 --> 01:01:29.580
<v Speaker 3>But like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1266
01:01:30.260 --> 01:01:35.260
<v Speaker 3>I feel like the need to even connect </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the twat sometimes just say,</v>

1267
01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:36.760
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1268
01:01:36.770 --> 01:01:38.330
<v Speaker 3>I'll sing for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you don't like it,</v>

1269
01:01:38.331 --> 01:01:39.860
<v Speaker 3>that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll sing for you.</v>

1270
01:01:39.890 --> 01:01:41.480
<v Speaker 3>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not above that.</v>

1271
01:01:41.980 --> 01:01:46.980
<v Speaker 3>But that was my chair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One more time.</v>

1272
01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:58.680
<v Speaker 3>I would tell you and rebecca.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's weird.</v>

1273
01:02:03.250 --> 01:02:05.910
<v Speaker 3>That's where there's no need for </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody to ask that question.</v>

1274
01:02:05.990 --> 01:02:06.770
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1275
01:02:06.770 --> 01:02:07.603
<v Speaker 3>it's just lazy entertaining.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also that job of being like the </v>

1276
01:02:11.031 --> 01:02:15.110
<v Speaker 3>radio host is a tough fucking job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get three minutes to talk to someone</v>

1277
01:02:15.111 --> 01:02:18.020
<v Speaker 3>you never talked to you before and maybe</v>
<v Speaker 3>not so good at it.</v>

1278
01:02:18.021 --> 01:02:20.160
<v Speaker 3>And djs on radio stations</v>

1279
01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:22.320
<v Speaker 1>nowadays,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not even really djs anymore.</v>

1280
01:02:22.350 --> 01:02:24.900
<v Speaker 1>They don't kit the pick the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>songs.</v>

1281
01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:27.720
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck lets you pick the songs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One dude,</v>

1282
01:02:27.721 --> 01:02:28.554
<v Speaker 1>fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some big daddy's out there on </v>

1283
01:02:32.050 --> 01:02:32.883
<v Speaker 1>the radio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like 10 stations across the </v>

1284
01:02:36.301 --> 01:02:39.950
<v Speaker 1>nation that are still public radio like </v>
<v Speaker 1>heaven and became a w.</v>

1285
01:02:39.951 --> 01:02:41.910
<v Speaker 1>Like it doesn't Jason Bentley,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like pick,</v>

1286
01:02:41.970 --> 01:02:44.550
<v Speaker 1>pick his yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's a unique thing.</v>

1287
01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:45.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's what I'm saying.</v>

1288
01:02:45.750 --> 01:02:47.400
<v Speaker 1>But that's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's still some,</v>

1289
01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:48.263
<v Speaker 1>some people that are holding court.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like game of thrones just knocking </v>

1290
01:02:52.230 --> 01:02:53.063
<v Speaker 1>bitches out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think it has to be small stations </v>

1291
01:02:54.991 --> 01:02:55.824
<v Speaker 1>were not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people are paying attention </v>

1292
01:02:56.670 --> 01:02:57.503
<v Speaker 1>exactly because the big ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they need the money that's going to </v>

1293
01:03:00.151 --> 01:03:03.210
<v Speaker 1>dictate the platelets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean you still can't.</v>

1294
01:03:03.380 --> 01:03:06.150
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that part of your job as a dj is even</v>

1295
01:03:06.151 --> 01:03:06.984
<v Speaker 1>taken away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then what is your fucking job to be </v>

1296
01:03:08.461 --> 01:03:09.630
<v Speaker 1>interesting on the air?</v>

1297
01:03:09.690 --> 01:03:11.760
<v Speaker 1>They can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you?</v>

1298
01:03:11.761 --> 01:03:13.650
<v Speaker 1>Um.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know how they get ratings?</v>

1299
01:03:13.651 --> 01:03:16.350
<v Speaker 1>This is the most hilarious thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or they did at least until recently,</v>

1300
01:03:16.351 --> 01:03:19.410
<v Speaker 1>they still do the arbitron shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that how they do the radio ratings?</v>

1301
01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:20.633
<v Speaker 1>The way they do it as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they hand out books and they asked </v>

1302
01:03:22.951 --> 01:03:23.784
<v Speaker 1>people to fill out the books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell us what you were listening to and </v>

1303
01:03:25.471 --> 01:03:27.260
<v Speaker 1>when you were listening to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what you,</v>

1304
01:03:27.300 --> 01:03:28.133
<v Speaker 1>what do you get?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get the opinion of assholes that it </v>

1305
01:03:30.351 --> 01:03:33.690
<v Speaker 1>will fucking books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's going to fill out that book?</v>

1306
01:03:33.870 --> 01:03:35.230
<v Speaker 1>They're going to give you that book and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he go,</v>

1307
01:03:35.260 --> 01:03:36.093
<v Speaker 1>what to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not filling out this fucking radio </v>

1308
01:03:38.641 --> 01:03:40.240
<v Speaker 1>book isn't like a sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1309
01:03:40.290 --> 01:03:41.123
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like our first record had a single </v>

1310
01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:47.670
<v Speaker 1>called little toy gun and they would </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they were testing that.</v>

1311
01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:49.440
<v Speaker 1>I guess maybe it's different now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1312
01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:52.110
<v Speaker 1>They were calling people like potential </v>
<v Speaker 1>listeners,</v>

1313
01:03:52.111 --> 01:03:52.944
<v Speaker 1>kind of like a nielsen vibe a little and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would play them a bunch of songs </v>

1314
01:03:55.381 --> 01:03:55.861
<v Speaker 1>and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>

1315
01:03:55.861 --> 01:03:56.694
<v Speaker 1>what did you like it like literally over</v>
<v Speaker 1>the phone you'd hear like 20 seconds of </v>

1316
01:03:59.791 --> 01:04:00.624
<v Speaker 1>a song and you give it a thumbs up or </v>
<v Speaker 1>thumbs down and that's how you're </v>

1317
01:04:02.641 --> 01:04:05.040
<v Speaker 1>getting the ratings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what defines whether our song was</v>

1318
01:04:05.041 --> 01:04:05.874
<v Speaker 1>successful</v>

1319
01:04:05.890 --> 01:04:06.810
<v Speaker 4>different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now though,</v>

1320
01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:07.833
<v Speaker 4>there's like it now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now you've got internet radio that's </v>

1321
01:04:11.641 --> 01:04:14.610
<v Speaker 4>free so people don't have to pay for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't have to call in,</v>

1322
01:04:14.611 --> 01:04:17.130
<v Speaker 4>they just have to listen and that is </v>
<v Speaker 4>monitored through,</v>

1323
01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:18.030
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can,</v>

1324
01:04:18.030 --> 01:04:22.480
<v Speaker 4>you can measure that through spotify or </v>
<v Speaker 4>pandora or apple music and like I,</v>

1325
01:04:22.950 --> 01:04:26.810
<v Speaker 4>I have a single out right now that came </v>
<v Speaker 4>out a month ago and it's really,</v>

1326
01:04:27.050 --> 01:04:29.320
<v Speaker 4>it's doing really well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's called.</v>

1327
01:04:29.590 --> 01:04:33.270
<v Speaker 4>It's called ghost into my bed and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing better than I thought it would.</v>

1328
01:04:33.271 --> 01:04:37.020
<v Speaker 4>I had no idea that it would be like </v>
<v Speaker 4>jumping from playlist two playlist.</v>

1329
01:04:37.110 --> 01:04:38.760
<v Speaker 4>I um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is our,</v>

1330
01:04:38.761 --> 01:04:39.530
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're doing solo</v>

1331
01:04:39.530 --> 01:04:41.690
<v Speaker 1>projects this year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much of a fucking bad.</v>

1332
01:04:44.670 --> 01:04:46.160
<v Speaker 4>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I looked at it,</v>

1333
01:04:46.690 --> 01:04:50.110
<v Speaker 4>it came out June 1st.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had like a couple hundred followers on</v>

1334
01:04:50.111 --> 01:04:53.200
<v Speaker 4>spotify and like that week I got like </v>
<v Speaker 4>10,000</v>

1335
01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:54.273
<v Speaker 4>and then like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the other week it was at like </v>

1336
01:04:56.921 --> 01:04:58.450
<v Speaker 4>37,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>followers.</v>

1337
01:04:58.451 --> 01:04:59.080
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

1338
01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:00.430
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it blew my mind and I,</v>

1339
01:05:00.790 --> 01:05:04.810
<v Speaker 4>I call,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a pr team that's,</v>

1340
01:05:04.860 --> 01:05:06.520
<v Speaker 4>you have a team.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've got a team.</v>

1341
01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:07.301
<v Speaker 4>I've got a team.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1342
01:05:07.301 --> 01:05:11.890
<v Speaker 4>because I want to own my music.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I hired a publicist,</v>

1343
01:05:12.610 --> 01:05:13.443
<v Speaker 4>a distributor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you get your manufacturing and </v>

1344
01:05:15.941 --> 01:05:18.160
<v Speaker 4>that's really all you need is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is</v>

1345
01:05:18.520 --> 01:05:20.380
<v Speaker 1>doing the fucking work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that crazy?</v>

1346
01:05:20.381 --> 01:05:24.040
<v Speaker 1>To own your own shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gotta hire a bunch of people because</v>

1347
01:05:24.100 --> 01:05:26.830
<v Speaker 1>record companies make you think that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>need them and you don't.</v>

1348
01:05:27.490 --> 01:05:29.470
<v Speaker 1>Some of them are great too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>WHat do they do now?</v>

1349
01:05:29.471 --> 01:05:31.540
<v Speaker 1>Like what's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's a record company good for today?</v>

1350
01:05:32.350 --> 01:05:34.180
<v Speaker 1>It would depends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they're actually good at their job,</v>

1351
01:05:34.181 --> 01:05:35.014
<v Speaker 1>they're good at a fucking selling music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's very rare and that's hard to </v>

1352
01:05:37.541 --> 01:05:38.374
<v Speaker 1>do for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a combination though because </v>

1353
01:05:41.111 --> 01:05:43.180
<v Speaker 1>obviously like if the music's not good </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough,</v>

1354
01:05:43.181 --> 01:05:45.220
<v Speaker 1>it's not gonna work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if it is great,</v>

1355
01:05:45.460 --> 01:05:47.260
<v Speaker 1>but there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so many different.</v>

1356
01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:49.030
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1357
01:05:49.031 --> 01:05:51.370
<v Speaker 1>it's a labyrinth of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh no,</v>

1358
01:05:51.430 --> 01:05:52.450
<v Speaker 1>we're going to lose them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.</v>

1359
01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:53.970
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ben is going to be all smiles.</v>

1360
01:05:54.340 --> 01:05:55.173
<v Speaker 1>Blake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

1361
01:05:56.170 --> 01:05:58.330
<v Speaker 1>He was great fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was so funny.</v>

1362
01:05:58.331 --> 01:05:59.164
<v Speaker 1>When you start reading,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just say that money isn't like </v>

1363
01:06:01.570 --> 01:06:02.403
<v Speaker 1>fun.</v>

1364
01:06:02.690 --> 01:06:04.110
<v Speaker 1>Fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>

1365
01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:06.120
<v Speaker 1>is this a test?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying we have it now.</v>

1366
01:06:06.121 --> 01:06:07.570
<v Speaker 1>It's on the internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You said it.</v>

1367
01:06:09.050 --> 01:06:12.670
<v Speaker 1>She said you're not funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a lot of fights on.</v>

1368
01:06:12.671 --> 01:06:13.504
<v Speaker 1>Ben gets stoned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I also love you and want you to be </v>

1369
01:06:15.401 --> 01:06:17.100
<v Speaker 1>happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means a lot to me.</v>

1370
01:06:17.590 --> 01:06:18.590
<v Speaker 1>This is live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1371
01:06:20.100 --> 01:06:21.930
<v Speaker 1>Ben's mom might wasn't there one day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

1372
01:06:22.310 --> 01:06:25.220
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1373
01:06:25.390 --> 01:06:26.223
<v Speaker 1>But in terms of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the record companies and releasing </v>

1374
01:06:29.291 --> 01:06:30.280
<v Speaker 1>music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have.</v>

1375
01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:33.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every artist is different.</v>

1376
01:06:33.491 --> 01:06:34.324
<v Speaker 1>Every approach is differeNt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think what's interesting is </v>

1377
01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:42.000
<v Speaker 1>they're jobs are becoming more and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>obsolete because of the evolution of the</v>

1378
01:06:42.611 --> 01:06:43.444
<v Speaker 1>industry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but don't they try and take a piece of </v>

1379

1382
01:06:54.250 --> 01:06:56.500

<v Speaker 1>The live music,</v>

1383
01:06:56.650 --> 01:06:59.340
<v Speaker 1>it depends on your position,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your situation.</v>

1384
01:06:59.350 --> 01:07:03.930
<v Speaker 1>Who was it that we had in what musician </v>

<v Speaker 1>She had a lot of really interesting </v>

1387
01:07:10.431 --> 01:07:10.871
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

1388
01:07:10.871 --> 01:07:11.704
<v Speaker 1>She's so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She might be like one of the coolest </v>

1389
01:07:13.181 --> 01:07:17.790
<v Speaker 1>people or garbage and a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it a hole forming at the.</v>

1390
01:07:18.060 --> 01:07:20.970
<v Speaker 1>At the bowl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bowl,</v>

1392
01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:26.800
<v Speaker 1>I'd started to wash it with my mom and </v>
<v Speaker 1>dad.</v>

1393
01:07:29.730 --> 01:07:31.330
<v Speaker 1>There was a journal that they put out to</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

1394
01:07:31.410 --> 01:07:32.243
<v Speaker 1>reads journals with my parents bought </v>
<v Speaker 1>the book because I was such a huge fan </v>

1395
01:07:37.541 --> 01:07:39.120
<v Speaker 1>and I felt like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1396
01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:40.033
<v Speaker 1>I should not be doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to read this to channels </v>

1397
01:07:42.310 --> 01:07:44.320
<v Speaker 1>that do change the war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was another one.</v>

1398
01:07:44.321 --> 01:07:46.960
<v Speaker 1>Like that guy had a sound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was something going on,</v>

1399
01:07:47.020 --> 01:07:48.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the lights out.</v>

1400
01:07:48.551 --> 01:07:49.690
<v Speaker 1>it's less dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1401
01:07:49.691 --> 01:07:52.150
<v Speaker 1>come on man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the words mean something to the</v>

1402
01:07:52.151 --> 01:07:52.984
<v Speaker 1>words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's the way he's expressing those </v>

1403
01:07:55.331 --> 01:08:00.331
<v Speaker 1>words or joe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's interesting about the icons of</v>

1404
01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:02.460
<v Speaker 1>the decades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1405
01:08:02.470 --> 01:08:05.830
<v Speaker 1>you get the sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like come see.</v>

1406
01:08:05.970 --> 01:08:09.160
<v Speaker 1>So the fifties were like everything's </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect.</v>

1407
01:08:09.190 --> 01:08:10.023
<v Speaker 1>We have the cleanest music and we have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>cookie cutter home and this is the life </v>

1408
01:08:14.621 --> 01:08:15.960
<v Speaker 1>and this is the husband.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this was like</v>

1409
01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:19.100
<v Speaker 4>the generation after world war ii of </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1410
01:08:19.101 --> 01:08:21.170
<v Speaker 4>everything's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're cool.</v>

1411
01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:24.290
<v Speaker 4>We just came back from war.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to make a lot of babies.</v>

1412
01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:24.801
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

1413
01:08:24.801 --> 01:08:29.801
<v Speaker 4>The fifties and there's this like total </v>
<v Speaker 4>disillusionment of oh no,</v>

1414
01:08:29.961 --> 01:08:30.794
<v Speaker 4>it was more survival I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then the sixties or like people </v>

1415
01:08:33.590 --> 01:08:34.423
<v Speaker 4>trying to feel more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that was when psychedelics were </v>

1416
01:08:36.171 --> 01:08:37.004
<v Speaker 4>coming into the fifties and elvis and </v>
<v Speaker 4>all this stuff that was up ending all </v>

1417
01:08:39.390 --> 01:08:41.280
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he,</v>

1418
01:08:41.290 --> 01:08:44.690
<v Speaker 4>he was pioneering that though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was late fifties,</v>

1419
01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:46.670
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>

1420
01:08:46.700 --> 01:08:47.533
<v Speaker 4>and then going into the sixties of </v>
<v Speaker 4>people like there's this dichotomy of </v>

1421
01:08:50.931 --> 01:08:51.770
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1422
01:08:51.771 --> 01:08:52.604
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the people kind of experiencing other </v>

1423
01:08:55.281 --> 01:08:56.114
<v Speaker 4>areas of life that aren't this sanitized</v>
<v Speaker 4>version of society and Blossoming more </v>

1424
01:09:01.490 --> 01:09:04.700
<v Speaker 4>into the seventies of just like harder </v>
<v Speaker 4>rock,</v>

1425
01:09:04.900 --> 01:09:05.650
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>think,</v>

1426
01:09:05.650 --> 01:09:07.340
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sonically speaking,</v>

1427
01:09:07.341 --> 01:09:08.174
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going into zeppelin and pink </v>

1428
01:09:10.881 --> 01:09:12.920
<v Speaker 4>floyd and cooper,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Alice Cooper.</v>

1429
01:09:13.820 --> 01:09:14.653
<v Speaker 4>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The eighties or interesting that the </v>

1430
01:09:15.951 --> 01:09:16.784
<v Speaker 4>glam of the eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't really help me out with the </v>

1431
01:09:19.611 --> 01:09:22.580
<v Speaker 4>significance of what that meant to </v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

1432
01:09:23.330 --> 01:09:24.560
<v Speaker 4>I think it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>

1433
01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:25.513
<v Speaker 4>it kind of went back to a little more of</v>
<v Speaker 4>this like pristine version of people in </v>

1434
01:09:29.841 --> 01:09:31.400
<v Speaker 4>society.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like,</v>

1435
01:09:31.590 --> 01:09:32.423
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me give you the clean version of </v>

1436
01:09:33.241 --> 01:09:34.890
<v Speaker 2>what will a lot of people believe </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>

1437
01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:36.820
<v Speaker 2>Drugs became illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1438
01:09:36.821 --> 01:09:39.030
<v Speaker 2>1970,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sweeping drug legislation.</v>

1439
01:09:39.031 --> 01:09:41.190
<v Speaker 2>Zach to schedule one act from Richard </v>
<v Speaker 2>Nixon.</v>

1440
01:09:41.610 --> 01:09:44.280
<v Speaker 2>As soon as it became illegal to possess </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything,</v>

1441
01:09:44.281 --> 01:09:47.040
<v Speaker 2>whether it's marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is illegal for a long time.</v>

1442
01:09:47.041 --> 01:09:47.874
<v Speaker 2>Mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was really hard to do drugs and you </v>

1443
01:09:50.551 --> 01:09:51.384
<v Speaker 2>just got this massive drop off in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>creativity of music in the eighties was </v>

1444
01:09:55.710 --> 01:09:56.543
<v Speaker 2>the anger,</v>

1445
01:09:57.010 --> 01:09:59.950
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was the product of,</v>

1446
01:09:59.980 --> 01:10:01.330
<v Speaker 4>of that disillusionment.</v>

1447
01:10:01.540 --> 01:10:05.140
<v Speaker 2>I grew up with reagan on tv and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't want plastic.</v>

1448
01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:08.920
<v Speaker 2>They just wanted everything to be like </v>
<v Speaker 2>flannel and he wanted to rain everyday.</v>

1449
01:10:09.190 --> 01:10:10.170
<v Speaker 2>People needed that</v>

1450
01:10:10.210 --> 01:10:11.043
<v Speaker 4>truth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They needed that reality in that </v>

1451
01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:14.310
<v Speaker 4>expression of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1452
01:10:15.670 --> 01:10:16.503
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we need so many different </v>

1453
01:10:17.831 --> 01:10:22.710
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We always need love.</v>

1454
01:10:22.990 --> 01:10:23.823
<v Speaker 4>We always knew,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think right now we're So </v>

1455
01:10:25.900 --> 01:10:30.400
<v Speaker 4>complicated and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and in our individual rights,</v>

1456
01:10:30.401 --> 01:10:31.990
<v Speaker 4>but all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1457
01:10:32.070 --> 01:10:34.240
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what people need so many </v>
<v Speaker 4>diffeRent things now.</v>

1458
01:10:34.820 --> 01:10:36.660
<v Speaker 2>You can't really say that it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like,</v>

1459
01:10:36.750 --> 01:10:37.583
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying you can't really say </v>

1460
01:10:40.391 --> 01:10:41.760
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying like,</v>

1461
01:10:42.100 --> 01:10:42.933
<v Speaker 2>it's so hard to say people need loVe or </v>
<v Speaker 2>people need this or people need </v>

1462
01:10:46.350 --> 01:10:47.183
<v Speaker 2>education and people need because it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't really say that there's any </v>

1463
01:10:51.581 --> 01:10:55.420
<v Speaker 2>one group of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so many groups of people,</v>

1464
01:10:55.780 --> 01:10:56.740
<v Speaker 2>but I do think mean</v>

1465
01:10:57.230 --> 01:11:02.230
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't get pulled out of the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just the spiraling of the phones and the</v>

1466
01:11:03.471 --> 01:11:04.304
<v Speaker 4>stuff for social media and I think the </v>
<v Speaker 4>only things that get them out of that </v>

1467
01:11:07.550 --> 01:11:12.550
<v Speaker 4>are real inspiration and I think real </v>
<v Speaker 4>inspiration has a,</v>

1468
01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:13.673
<v Speaker 4>is the spectrum of that is very wide.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whether it's just a folk song or it's </v>

1469
01:11:17.341 --> 01:11:18.174
<v Speaker 4>like you're at a club and it's got that </v>
<v Speaker 4>whole rhythm of electronic music and </v>

1470
01:11:22.651 --> 01:11:23.484
<v Speaker 4>you're just with a group of people and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're having this like tribal </v>

1471
01:11:25.081 --> 01:11:26.910
<v Speaker 4>collective thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cool.</v>

1472
01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:28.553
<v Speaker 4>I Think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that that's why I feel like you </v>

1473
01:11:30.901 --> 01:11:32.610
<v Speaker 4>asked what people need.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1474
01:11:32.611 --> 01:11:33.990
<v Speaker 4>Everyone needs something different and </v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1475
01:11:33.991 --> 01:11:34.770
<v Speaker 4>you totally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1476
01:11:34.770 --> 01:11:37.320
<v Speaker 4>and whatever that is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it just needs to inspire them.</v>

1477
01:11:38.380 --> 01:11:39.213
<v Speaker 4>We just need to know as a group </v>
<v Speaker 4>recognize that we're all so fucking </v>

1478
01:11:43.081 --> 01:11:43.914
<v Speaker 4>different and we've got to stop trying </v>
<v Speaker 4>to fit everybody into these little </v>

<v Speaker 2>very well spoken guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people want you to follow their </v>

1489
01:12:09.630 --> 01:12:10.463
<v Speaker 2>guidelines for how you should think and </v>
<v Speaker 2>communicate and what you sort of accept </v>

1490
01:12:13.861 --> 01:12:14.694
<v Speaker 2>and what you should argue against or not</v>
<v Speaker 2>argue against and it becomes this weird </v>

1491
01:12:19.860 --> 01:12:20.693
<v Speaker 2>sort of control game that goes on and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what's happening with a lot of </v>

1492
01:12:24.361 --> 01:12:27.300
<v Speaker 2>people in this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this nation is fine nation right now.</v>

1493
01:12:27.301 --> 01:12:29.460
<v Speaker 2>People are realizing that they have </v>
<v Speaker 2>control over people,</v>

1494
01:12:29.670 --> 01:12:30.503
<v Speaker 2>so they're exerting that control almost </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same way as a person in power does </v>

1495
01:12:34.330 --> 01:12:35.163
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like one of the things that abraham </v>

1496
01:12:36.481 --> 01:12:37.560
<v Speaker 2>lincoln said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was really brilliant.</v>

1497
01:12:37.740 --> 01:12:40.410
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most men can overcome adversity.</v>

1498
01:12:40.411 --> 01:12:41.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm paraphrasing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

1499
01:12:41.420 --> 01:12:44.500
<v Speaker 2>most men can overcome adversity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you really want to test.</v>

1500
01:12:44.501 --> 01:12:45.690
<v Speaker 2>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd give them success.</v>

1501
01:12:46.710 --> 01:12:51.710
<v Speaker 2>Which I thought was really fascinating </v>
<v Speaker 2>for a lot of people like that are in big</v>

1502
01:12:52.951 --> 01:12:53.784
<v Speaker 2>positions of power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the president United States for </v>

1503
01:12:55.230 --> 01:12:56.910
<v Speaker 2>perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the.</v>

1504
01:12:56.920 --> 01:13:01.830
<v Speaker 2>The idea of him getting through that and</v>
<v Speaker 2>not falling apart his way.</v>

1505
01:13:01.860 --> 01:13:04.620
<v Speaker 2>Like you realize like what a bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>motherfuCker obama was.</v>

1506
01:13:04.650 --> 01:13:05.850
<v Speaker 2>Holy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

1507
01:13:06.210 --> 01:13:11.210
<v Speaker 2>people have zero idea how good obama's </v>
<v Speaker 2>composure was to get through that entire</v>

1508
01:13:12.810 --> 01:13:17.810
<v Speaker 2>eight years in the white house without </v>
<v Speaker 2>one like really gross misstep socially.</v>

1509
01:13:19.110 --> 01:13:22.300
<v Speaker 2>RigHt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't have one that's,</v>

1510
01:13:22.380 --> 01:13:23.213
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a lot of people that </v>

1511
01:13:23.971 --> 01:13:26.790
<v Speaker 2>would probably disagree with that and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't agree with them,</v>

1512
01:13:27.450 --> 01:13:28.283
<v Speaker 2>but that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that kind of ideological thing </v>

1513
01:13:30.001 --> 01:13:30.834
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do think that there was one thing </v>

1514
01:13:32.491 --> 01:13:34.140
<v Speaker 2>that he said he was joking around that </v>
<v Speaker 2>white horse,</v>

1515
01:13:34.260 --> 01:13:39.260
<v Speaker 2>white house press correspondents' dinner</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the jonas brothers and about a has</v>

1516
01:13:39.421 --> 01:13:41.490
<v Speaker 2>two words for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1517
01:13:41.491 --> 01:13:43.920
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember that it was something </v>
<v Speaker 2>about drones.</v>

1518
01:13:44.310 --> 01:13:48.290
<v Speaker 2>What's the word?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was the big name for the drone?</v>

1519
01:13:49.150 --> 01:13:51.240
<v Speaker 2>There's like a name or another name for </v>
<v Speaker 2>that drone.</v>

1520
01:13:51.730 --> 01:13:53.970
<v Speaker 2>It was like a type of drone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't there?</v>

1521
01:13:54.850 --> 01:13:56.850
<v Speaker 2>Didn't he say that to them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>To the jonas bRothers?</v>

1522
01:13:59.220 --> 01:14:00.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's kinda like a name.</v>

1523
01:14:00.301 --> 01:14:01.134
<v Speaker 2>There's a name for one of the drones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the things that he said and </v>

1524
01:14:02.971 --> 01:14:03.804
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on man,</v>

1525
01:14:03.990 --> 01:14:04.823
<v Speaker 2>you've killed like 84 percent civilians </v>
<v Speaker 2>with drones or the United States has </v>

1526
01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:11.070
<v Speaker 2>like to say to joke around</v>

1527
01:14:12.970 --> 01:14:15.310
<v Speaker 1>with someone who wants to date your </v>
<v Speaker 1>daughter.</v>

1528
01:14:15.311 --> 01:14:19.140
<v Speaker 1>Come on man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what was the predator?</v>

1529
01:14:19.590 --> 01:14:24.590
<v Speaker 1>Predator after them if they are huge </v>
<v Speaker 1>fans,</v>

1530
01:14:25.910 --> 01:14:30.910
<v Speaker 1>2010 Boys don't get any ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have two words for you.</v>

1531
01:14:31.690 --> 01:14:32.523
<v Speaker 1>Predator drones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll never see a comment that he's </v>

1532
01:14:38.021 --> 01:14:38.854
<v Speaker 1>joking around about killing people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know many people lost their </v>

1533
01:14:40.901 --> 01:14:44.110
<v Speaker 1>children to predator drones while he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>an office?</v>

1534
01:14:44.410 --> 01:14:47.380
<v Speaker 1>A lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of those things.</v>

1535
01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:50.860
<v Speaker 1>They take a look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people that are trying to kill those</v>

1536
01:14:51.460 --> 01:14:52.293
<v Speaker 1>terrorists out there and the isis </v>
<v Speaker 1>members and all the different people </v>

1537
01:14:54.881 --> 01:14:55.714
<v Speaker 1>that are doing horrible things like </v>
<v Speaker 1>blowing up ariana grande concerts and </v>

1538
01:14:59.531 --> 01:15:00.364
<v Speaker 1>all that kind of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the people that are trying to </v>

1539
01:15:02.231 --> 01:15:04.870
<v Speaker 1>stop those people have an insanely </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult job.</v>

1540
01:15:04.930 --> 01:15:09.650
<v Speaker 1>Don't get me wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you're shooting missiles out of</v>

1541
01:15:09.651 --> 01:15:13.000
<v Speaker 1>robots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're killing mostly innocent people.</v>

1542
01:15:13.270 --> 01:15:14.103
<v Speaker 1>It's not like clothes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like half and half like they </v>

1543
01:15:16.871 --> 01:15:19.030
<v Speaker 1>kill half bad guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good guys.</v>

1544
01:15:19.060 --> 01:15:21.850
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they killed mostly good people.</v>

1545
01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:23.070
<v Speaker 1>Put it in then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1546
01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:23.980
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's okay.</v>

1547
01:15:24.190 --> 01:15:25.023
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it speaks more to the position of the </v>

1548
01:15:25.961 --> 01:15:29.520
<v Speaker 1>president is being a tough fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can't.</v>

1549
01:15:29.590 --> 01:15:30.423
<v Speaker 1>You can't be a comedian and a comedian </v>
<v Speaker 1>can say whatever the fuck and it's fine </v>

1550
01:15:34.391 --> 01:15:36.550
<v Speaker 1>because you're a comedian or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would have better delivery.</v>

1551
01:15:37.630 --> 01:15:42.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm imagining coming a mile away to </v>
<v Speaker 1>adwords for you.</v>

1552
01:15:43.721 --> 01:15:44.680
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be funny words.</v>

1553
01:15:47.210 --> 01:15:50.230
<v Speaker 1>He's just joking around about something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a.</v>

1554
01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:51.470
<v Speaker 1>It's dark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1555
01:15:51.490 --> 01:15:55.480
<v Speaker 1>It's like you'll never see it coming </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of those people that died.</v>

1556
01:15:55.510 --> 01:15:57.890
<v Speaker 1>Thousands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of fucked up.</v>

1557
01:15:57.970 --> 01:15:58.803
<v Speaker 1>If you were living in a country where </v>
<v Speaker 1>obama was the guy who made the call and </v>

1558
01:16:04.691 --> 01:16:05.524
<v Speaker 1>the missiles came from the drones and </v>
<v Speaker 1>killed your dad and you have to watch </v>

1559
01:16:08.141 --> 01:16:08.974
<v Speaker 1>him joke around about shooting missiles </v>
<v Speaker 1>at some kids that want to fuck your </v>

1560
01:16:12.281 --> 01:16:14.490
<v Speaker 1>pretty good daughters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

1561
01:16:14.740 --> 01:16:15.573
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a.</v>

1562
01:16:16.690 --> 01:16:18.460
<v Speaker 1>We don't look at it that way because </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're over here,</v>

1563
01:16:18.490 --> 01:16:19.323
<v Speaker 1>but how can we like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can you process that level of a </v>

1564
01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:26.800
<v Speaker 1>variety?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a shitty word for it,</v>

1565
01:16:26.801 --> 01:16:27.634
<v Speaker 1>but like there's so much shit going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why all this social media is </v>

1566
01:16:30.761 --> 01:16:33.730
<v Speaker 1>happening because along with being a </v>
<v Speaker 1>distraction and a problem,</v>

1567
01:16:33.731 --> 01:16:36.970
<v Speaker 1>it's also helping us cope with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>degree of the world.</v>

1568
01:16:36.971 --> 01:16:39.130
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so many fucking people.</v>

1569
01:16:39.430 --> 01:16:44.430
<v Speaker 1>How,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how could you ever be sensitive to the,</v>

1570
01:16:44.770 --> 01:16:48.580
<v Speaker 1>to the entire situation while being an </v>
<v Speaker 1>authentic person.</v>

1571
01:16:48.610 --> 01:16:49.870
<v Speaker 1>Does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1572
01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:53.560
<v Speaker 1>but I think this is what we were talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about earlier of like trying to.</v>

1573
01:16:54.540 --> 01:16:59.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's the fucking smallest level</v>
<v Speaker 1>of like learn how to apologize,</v>

1574
01:16:59.350 --> 01:17:00.183
<v Speaker 1>but learn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>learn how to be different from each </v>

1575
01:17:01.961 --> 01:17:02.794
<v Speaker 1>other and also work together and know </v>
<v Speaker 1>that like we have different speeds and </v>

1576
01:17:06.461 --> 01:17:09.800
<v Speaker 1>different beliefs and have compassion</v>

1577
01:17:10.460 --> 01:17:11.293
<v Speaker 4>and I think that's where it's really </v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy to have so much exposure to the </v>

1578
01:17:16.341 --> 01:17:17.174
<v Speaker 4>global events and become desensitized to</v>
<v Speaker 4>them because there's so much stuff that </v>

1579
01:17:21.411 --> 01:17:23.180
<v Speaker 4>it eventually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you can't compute.</v>

1580
01:17:23.210 --> 01:17:25.880
<v Speaker 4>You can't process it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it doesn't.</v>

1581
01:17:25.881 --> 01:17:26.780
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously there's,</v>

1582
01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:27.673
<v Speaker 4>there's no excuse for making jokes about</v>
<v Speaker 4>drones and killing people had to make </v>

1583
01:17:31.521 --> 01:17:34.160
<v Speaker 4>some jokes and some forum,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but no,</v>

1584
01:17:34.161 --> 01:17:36.260
<v Speaker 4>you're totally right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's too much Information.</v>

1585
01:17:36.410 --> 01:17:40.620
<v Speaker 4>You're getting news from $7 million,</v>
<v Speaker 4>putting it on one man when he.</v>

1586
01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:41.833
<v Speaker 4>He is not just one man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he is a group of people working </v>

1587
01:17:46.491 --> 01:17:49.970
<v Speaker 4>together,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he has to speak for everyone and and</v>

1588
01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.490
<v Speaker 4>so does trump and so does whoever is </v>
<v Speaker 4>president and,</v>

1589
01:17:52.610 --> 01:17:53.443
<v Speaker 4>and that's really interesting is that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>think what has happened now with the </v>

1590
01:17:57.201 --> 01:18:00.890
<v Speaker 4>election of trump is that people are </v>
<v Speaker 4>becoming so much more aware that there's</v>

1591
01:18:01.130 --> 01:18:04.910
<v Speaker 4>an entire cabinet and congress and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>people that we elect,</v>

1592
01:18:04.911 --> 01:18:09.911
<v Speaker 4>that we choose are going to be part of </v>
<v Speaker 4>that entire team and it's,</v>

1593
01:18:11.071 --> 01:18:12.900
<v Speaker 4>it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1594
01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:15.890
<v Speaker 4>it's focusing people on politics in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>way it never has before.</v>

1595
01:18:16.780 --> 01:18:17.613
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is.</v>

1596
01:18:17.780 --> 01:18:20.690
<v Speaker 4>Corruption in a weird way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like a real transparent.</v>

1597
01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:23.420
<v Speaker 4>Speaking of corruption,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I talked to you about this guy.</v>

1598
01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:28.720
<v Speaker 4>I'm about a represent us and it's this </v>
<v Speaker 4>organization that I went to this meeting</v>

1599
01:18:30.140 --> 01:18:33.530
<v Speaker 4>and was really informed for the first </v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

1600
01:18:33.531 --> 01:18:38.531
<v Speaker 4>I'd never really understood how people </v>
<v Speaker 4>in congress kind of came to be these,</v>

1601
01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:40.620
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1602
01:18:41.090 --> 01:18:45.440
<v Speaker 4>runners in these elections,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whereas it costs 40 to $60,000</v>

1603
01:18:45.441 --> 01:18:49.010
<v Speaker 4>a day to run for congress and that is </v>
<v Speaker 4>legal.</v>

1604
01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:51.260
<v Speaker 4>That's not illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's so crazy.</v>

01:18:51.470 --> 01:18:53.060
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>they're working on a long day anti </v>

1609
01:18:58.371 --> 01:19:02.090
<v Speaker 4>corruption bills so that anybody can run</v>
<v Speaker 4>some,</v>

1610
01:19:02.150 --> 01:19:02.983
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1612
01:19:07.460 --> 01:19:08.293
<v Speaker 4>qual,</v>
<v Speaker 4>overqualified person from say columbia </v>

1613
01:19:11.121 --> 01:19:16.121
<v Speaker 4>or harvard or wherever in the world or </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the states who we elected.</v>

1614
01:19:16.340 --> 01:19:20.780
<v Speaker 4>Whereas these people that cost that much</v>
<v Speaker 4>money to run their,</v>

1615
01:19:20.781 --> 01:19:24.230
<v Speaker 4>they're controlled by the koch brothers </v>
<v Speaker 4>and all the major oil industries.</v>

1616
01:19:24.260 --> 01:19:26.810
<v Speaker 4>What are they spending the money on it </v>
<v Speaker 4>because that much a day.</v>

1617
01:19:27.380 --> 01:19:28.213
<v Speaker 4>That's just the game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's just transportation of </v>

1618
01:19:30.870 --> 01:19:31.703
<v Speaker 4>advertisement,</v>
<v Speaker 4>promotion and you don't qualify if you </v>

1619
01:19:34.251 --> 01:19:35.930
<v Speaker 4>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you don't play that game.</v>

1620
01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:37.660
<v Speaker 4>But here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can qualify,</v>

1621
01:19:37.700 --> 01:19:41.570
<v Speaker 4>like if you ran for senate or something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you would be spending $60 for president.</v>

1622
01:19:41.810 --> 01:19:43.730
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what's interesting,</v>

1623
01:19:43.731 --> 01:19:44.564
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I.</v>

1624
01:19:44.620 --> 01:19:48.050
<v Speaker 4>Well it because you have a platform </v>
<v Speaker 4>already and people have platforms in the</v>

1625
01:19:48.051 --> 01:19:49.460
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's Donald Trump.</v>

1626
01:19:49.730 --> 01:19:50.563
<v Speaker 4>Did you know that when you have a </v>
<v Speaker 4>platform she run up for like stan hope </v>

1627
01:19:52.741 --> 01:19:53.574
<v Speaker 4>was running for president for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We had a friend that ran for president </v>

1628
01:19:57.770 --> 01:19:58.603
<v Speaker 4>while he was running for president is </v>
<v Speaker 4>that he couldn't do standup shows </v>

1629
01:20:01.641 --> 01:20:05.150
<v Speaker 4>anymore because if he was going to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>something on stage,</v>

1630
01:20:05.151 --> 01:20:06.860
<v Speaker 4>he would have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If it was like a public</v>

1631
01:20:08.490 --> 01:20:09.323
<v Speaker 2>where people were coming to see him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would have to allot time for his </v>

1632
01:20:11.911 --> 01:20:13.450
<v Speaker 2>opponents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1633
01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:14.640
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

1634
01:20:14.700 --> 01:20:15.540
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1635
01:20:15.541 --> 01:20:16.950
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a crazy scam.</v>

1636
01:20:16.980 --> 01:20:18.800
<v Speaker 2>It's like you can most of the game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1637
01:20:18.870 --> 01:20:22.350
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of like weird freaky old </v>
<v Speaker 2>school rules.</v>

1638
01:20:22.351 --> 01:20:23.184
<v Speaker 2>Back when people would stand on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>soapbox and scream out into a large </v>

1639
01:20:26.371 --> 01:20:29.330
<v Speaker 2>group of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those rules still apply crazy.</v>

1640
01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:32.010
<v Speaker 2>But the thing is you can do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can still,</v>

1641
01:20:32.130 --> 01:20:34.440
<v Speaker 2>if you have 10 million people being </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1642
01:20:34.470 --> 01:20:37.380
<v Speaker 2>that's a stupid rule or however many it </v>
<v Speaker 2>takes,</v>

1643
01:20:37.650 --> 01:20:39.660
<v Speaker 2>it'll change maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But look,</v>

1644
01:20:39.661 --> 01:20:41.910
<v Speaker 2>it's still federally illegal to smoke </v>
<v Speaker 2>marijuana.</v>

1645
01:20:41.970 --> 01:20:45.510
<v Speaker 2>there's no reason why we did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the state legal,</v>

1646
01:20:45.540 --> 01:20:48.290
<v Speaker 2>but federally it's still illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not as simple as.</v>

1647
01:20:49.340 --> 01:20:52.860
<v Speaker 2>It's not as simple as like 10 million </v>
<v Speaker 2>people can say.</v>

1648
01:20:52.861 --> 01:20:54.810
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to take more totally </v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1649
01:20:54.930 --> 01:20:55.900
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the same day.</v>

1650
01:20:56.340 --> 01:20:58.050
<v Speaker 2>what's going to go on with our political</v>
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>

1651
01:20:58.051 --> 01:20:58.591
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1652
01:20:58.591 --> 01:21:00.420
<v Speaker 2>it needs an Overhaul and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it needs to be changed.</v>

1653
01:21:00.421 --> 01:21:01.254
<v Speaker 2>Needs to be updated for the internet and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the 2017 world that we live in and we </v>

1654
01:21:04.591 --> 01:21:06.240
<v Speaker 2>need to figure out a better way to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1655
01:21:06.241 --> 01:21:08.670
<v Speaker 2>We don't need the same sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>representative government that we alwaYs</v>

1656
01:21:08.671 --> 01:21:09.504
<v Speaker 2>needed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you had to take a message from a </v>

1657
01:21:11.161 --> 01:21:13.710
<v Speaker 2>fucking horse travel,</v>

1658
01:21:13.770 --> 01:21:15.360
<v Speaker 4>the pricing is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like if,</v>

1659
01:21:15.380 --> 01:21:16.213
<v Speaker 4>if you wAnna,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you want that to change from the </v>

1660
01:21:18.181 --> 01:21:19.014
<v Speaker 4>ground up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're asking the people that are </v>

1661
01:21:20.881 --> 01:21:24.210
<v Speaker 4>currently in office to bet against </v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves to say,</v>

1662
01:21:24.211 --> 01:21:26.050
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's make it illegal</v>

1663
01:21:26.230 --> 01:21:28.400

<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1664
01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:30.193
<v Speaker 2>Stop thinking that they're better or </v>
<v Speaker 2>different than us and that's where it </v>

1665
01:21:32.831 --> 01:21:34.150
<v Speaker 2>becomes unfathomable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1666
01:21:34.151 --> 01:21:37.390
<v Speaker 2>they have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to just like everybody else,</v>

1667
01:21:37.870 --> 01:21:41.290
<v Speaker 2>we all have to realize that we're all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same thing and every,</v>

1668
01:21:41.291 --> 01:21:42.124

01:21:44.981 --> 01:21:45.814
<v Speaker 2>other day that people couldn't at one </v>
<v Speaker 2>point in time couldn't imagine the idea </v>

<v Speaker 2>that one day there'd be no kings and </v>

<v Speaker 2>and it's for sure going to happen.</v>

1673
01:21:54.610 --> 01:21:57.370
<v Speaker 2>The president or whoever runs for </v>
<v Speaker 2>congress or senate,</v>

1674
01:21:57.610 --> 01:21:58.443
<v Speaker 2>they have to come to an understanding </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they are no different than us just </v>

1675
01:22:02.020 --> 01:22:04.570
<v Speaker 2>because they're in positions of power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not different.</v>

1676
01:22:05.340 --> 01:22:06.173
<v Speaker 2>We're all just people and that if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have extra power over people and you </v>

1677

<v Speaker 2>you're getting sun you.</v>

1694
01:22:44.710 --> 01:22:45.543
<v Speaker 4>This is a play on words.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bullshit that's happening in the media </v>

<v Speaker 4>They just circumvent around the truth or</v>

1697
01:22:55.031 --> 01:22:59.620
<v Speaker 4>whatever they're trying to say with just</v>
<v Speaker 4>just stupid rhetoric is so annoying.</v>

<v Speaker 4>ago</v>

1701
01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:06.813
<v Speaker 2>that news wouldn't have gotten out or </v>
<v Speaker 2>there would have been ways to just like </v>

<v Speaker 2>to hide that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just that.</v>

<v Speaker 2>When you hear something interesting that</v>

01:23:32.810 --> 01:23:33.643
<v Speaker 2>This interesting conversation really </v>
<v Speaker 2>made me think about something and then </v>

01:23:39.910 --> 01:23:44.080
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't available 20 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like all the social media stuff,</v>

<v Speaker 2>can make or podcast that people can make</v>
<v Speaker 2>or whatever the fuck it is.</v>

1717
01:23:51.340 --> 01:23:52.173
<v Speaker 2>Blogs that people can write.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of it is just information and that </v>

1718
01:23:56.741 --> 01:23:58.960
<v Speaker 2>flow of information has never been </v>
<v Speaker 2>greater.</v>

<v Speaker 2>fucking plastic surgery.</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is really happening.</v>

1729
01:24:33.870 --> 01:24:34.703
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's for sure a bad system that no one </v>

1730
01:24:36.001 --> 01:24:37.770
<v Speaker 2>wants to join in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're elon musk,</v>

1731
01:24:37.771 --> 01:24:39.210
<v Speaker 2>why the fuck would you want to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>president?</v>

1732
01:24:39.350 --> 01:24:41.540
<v Speaker 2>I can bang supermodels and build rocket </v>
<v Speaker 2>ships.</v>

1733
01:24:41.550 --> 01:24:42.530
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do I want to know?</v>

1734
01:24:42.530 --> 01:24:42.540
<v Speaker 2>Do you know</v>

1735
01:24:42.540 --> 01:24:43.373
<v Speaker 4>about our car?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you know the funny story about our </v>

1736
01:24:45.301 --> 01:24:46.860
<v Speaker 4>touring vehicle?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do not.</v>

1737
01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:47.490
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's great.</v>

1738
01:24:47.490 --> 01:24:48.360
<v Speaker 4>Drop it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1739
01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:49.350
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my god.</v>

1740
01:24:49.351 --> 01:24:50.430
<v Speaker 4>Ben,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it three years ago?</v>

1741
01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:52.260
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Twenty 15,</v>

1742
01:24:52.290 --> 01:24:56.400
<v Speaker 4>2015.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So in spring of 2015 we thought it would</v>

1743
01:24:56.401 --> 01:24:57.234
<v Speaker 4>be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is when we put punk kid up for a </v>

1744
01:24:59.611 --> 01:25:00.444
<v Speaker 4>donation so we could buy a car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we could tour and we didn't want to </v>

1745
01:25:02.701 --> 01:25:05.520
<v Speaker 4>buy a van because that's annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who wants a van?</v>

1746
01:25:05.910 --> 01:25:06.743
<v Speaker 4>And we ended up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were looking at [inaudible] and we </v>

1747
01:25:08.970 --> 01:25:13.150
<v Speaker 4>found a cadillac escalades.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Two thousand seven seas decided,</v>

1748
01:25:14.300 --> 01:25:18.090
<v Speaker 4>well they're all the same car ps four it</v>
<v Speaker 4>expeditions,</v>

1749
01:25:18.091 --> 01:25:20.700
<v Speaker 4>escalades navigators to whatever the </v>
<v Speaker 4>year.</v>

1750
01:25:20.701 --> 01:25:22.500
<v Speaker 4>They're the same,</v>
<v Speaker 4>same structure,</v>

1751
01:25:22.501 --> 01:25:23.334
<v Speaker 4>just different clothes and there was a </v>
<v Speaker 4>great deal on a cadillac escalades and </v>

1752
01:25:28.530 --> 01:25:29.363
<v Speaker 4>we had like good a lot of touring in </v>
<v Speaker 4>front of us and we bought it and we </v>

1753
01:25:34.651 --> 01:25:36.390
<v Speaker 4>were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we bought it with 60,000</v>

1754
01:25:36.391 --> 01:25:38.100
<v Speaker 4>miles on it and it was in mint </v>
<v Speaker 4>condition,</v>

1755
01:25:38.101 --> 01:25:39.300
<v Speaker 4>which was really strange.</v>

1756
01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:43.510
<v Speaker 4>And like the used car salesman logan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's clearly no kids in the backseat.</v>

1757
01:25:43.620 --> 01:25:45.130
<v Speaker 4>There's no cheerios took between the </v>
<v Speaker 4>seats.</v>

1758
01:25:46.170 --> 01:25:47.003
<v Speaker 4>And so we ended up buying this car and </v>
<v Speaker 4>we were looking through the user manual </v>

1759
01:25:52.410 --> 01:25:55.710
<v Speaker 4>to like what does this button do in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>former owner registration fell out.</v>

1760
01:25:55.711 --> 01:26:00.711
<v Speaker 4>Swear to got elon musk and ben had this </v>
<v Speaker 4>great idea,</v>

1761
01:26:01.830 --> 01:26:06.830
<v Speaker 4>great idea to get him to design a tesco </v>
<v Speaker 4>laid for better economical touring.</v>

1762
01:26:08.900 --> 01:26:11.060
<v Speaker 4>But to put it into perspective though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we did,</v>

1763
01:26:11.061 --> 01:26:12.680
<v Speaker 4>we bought it with 60,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>miles an hour.</v>

1764
01:26:12.681 --> 01:26:13.514
<v Speaker 4>It has like a 160,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>miles on it and that was just about a </v>

1765
01:26:16.701 --> 01:26:17.780
<v Speaker 4>little over two years ago.</v>

1766
01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:18.713
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen that shit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's going to do in California where he </v>

1767
01:26:20.070 --> 01:26:23.100
<v Speaker 2>bores holes under los angeles and makes </v>
<v Speaker 2>tunnels.</v>

1768
01:26:23.101 --> 01:26:25.740
<v Speaker 2>And you ride a sled through the tunnel?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard about it,</v>

1769
01:26:25.970 --> 01:26:26.803
<v Speaker 2>but I heard about briefly actually you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You dropped down into this tunnel and </v>

1770
01:26:30.371 --> 01:26:32.370
<v Speaker 2>you go shoot you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't drive your car.</v>

1771
01:26:32.910 --> 01:26:34.730
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>John?</v>

1772
01:26:34.731 --> 01:26:35.431
<v Speaker 2>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll pull it up.</v>

1773
01:26:35.431 --> 01:26:37.650
<v Speaker 2>You could see it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So watch what happens timmy.</v>

1774
01:26:38.030 --> 01:26:40.530
<v Speaker 2>You pull up to this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a wizard.</v>

1775
01:26:40.770 --> 01:26:44.460
<v Speaker 2>You pull up to this thing and it drops </v>
<v Speaker 2>you down to your car.</v>

1776
01:26:44.490 --> 01:26:45.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it drops you down.</v>

1777
01:26:45.870 --> 01:26:48.630
<v Speaker 2>You get your blood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get in the queue and you dropped down.</v>

1778
01:26:48.631 --> 01:26:51.810
<v Speaker 2>And then you get on a sled your cars on </v>
<v Speaker 2>a sled so you're not driving anymore.</v>

1779
01:26:52.150 --> 01:26:54.330
<v Speaker 2>And your car can be on a Solar powered </v>
<v Speaker 2>sled too,</v>

1780
01:26:54.331 --> 01:26:56.760
<v Speaker 2>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But all the power we have in la from the</v>

1781
01:26:56.761 --> 01:26:57.594
<v Speaker 2>sun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it never stops being sunny out </v>

1782
01:26:59.340 --> 01:26:59.490
<v Speaker 2>of.</v>

1783
01:26:59.490 --> 01:27:02.160
<v Speaker 2>They wanted to make these giant solar </v>
<v Speaker 2>banks to power this thing.</v>

1784
01:27:02.161 --> 01:27:03.740
<v Speaker 2>I bet they could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a video of it,</v>

1785
01:27:03.780 --> 01:27:05.910
<v Speaker 2>like the idea of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the animated version of it.</v>

1786
01:27:06.300 --> 01:27:08.760
<v Speaker 2>So of course everyone in the street,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's driving a tesla.</v>

1787
01:27:08.761 --> 01:27:09.594
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing but tesla's and an old </v>
<v Speaker 2>rotten shitty cars from the 60 pay more </v>

1788
01:27:14.940 --> 01:27:16.850
<v Speaker 2>to get on the sled to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1789
01:27:17.110 --> 01:27:20.040
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise you're one of those traffic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So watch this,</v>

1790
01:27:20.041 --> 01:27:22.590
<v Speaker 2>you dropped down and then once you </v>
<v Speaker 2>dropped down,</v>

1791
01:27:23.070 --> 01:27:23.903
<v Speaker 2>you are in these tunnels that he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>building that are totally earthquake </v>

1792
01:27:26.251 --> 01:27:28.260
<v Speaker 2>proof.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't worry when they fill up with water</v>

1793
01:27:28.261 --> 01:27:30.630
<v Speaker 2>and kill you and your family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't sweat it.</v>

1794
01:27:32.650 --> 01:27:37.650
<v Speaker 2>Look after you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Make sure you have your go bag ready.</v>

1795
01:27:38.761 --> 01:27:43.761
<v Speaker 2>Fan of is your oxygen mask on freeways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just need everybody to understand that</v>

1796
01:27:44.791 --> 01:27:45.624
<v Speaker 2>when the 1000 foot waves come,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will not survive in these fucking </v>

1797
01:27:48.451 --> 01:27:49.284
<v Speaker 2>tubes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They will fill up with water and you </v>

1798
01:27:51.541 --> 01:27:52.790
<v Speaker 2>will drown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

1799
01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:56.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm so scared of most likely that </v>
<v Speaker 2>tsunamis not common,</v>

1800
01:27:56.640 --> 01:27:58.570
<v Speaker 2>but if anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is insane.</v>

1801
01:27:58.650 --> 01:27:59.540
<v Speaker 2>That's a wrap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1802
01:27:59.570 --> 01:28:01.230
<v Speaker 2>a lot of thumbs downs though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1803
01:28:01.231 --> 01:28:02.850
<v Speaker 2>because people are freaking out about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ocean.</v>

1804
01:28:02.890 --> 01:28:03.723
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rIght next to the fucking ocean in the </v>

1805
01:28:04.951 --> 01:28:09.951
<v Speaker 2>ground moves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we shouldn't be flying cars,</v>

1806
01:28:15.090 --> 01:28:18.210
<v Speaker 2>flying cars that have batteries in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>front so they can hit each other.</v>

1807
01:28:18.211 --> 01:28:19.170
<v Speaker 2>So they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>repel,</v>

1808
01:28:21.270 --> 01:28:22.530
<v Speaker 2>repel.</v>

1817
01:28:46.490 --> 01:28:49.580
<v Speaker 4>just hacking hacking into any kind of </v>

1825
01:29:06.421 --> 01:29:07.254
<v Speaker 2>that journalists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they think the big conspiracy theory is </v>

1826
01:29:09.180 --> 01:29:09.660
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1827
01:29:09.660 --> 01:29:13.710
<v Speaker 2>he was killed because they overtook the </v>
<v Speaker 2>controls of his car and slammed him into</v>

1828
01:29:13.711 --> 01:29:15.600
<v Speaker 2>a tree and made him go 120 miles an </v>
<v Speaker 2>hour.</v>

1829
01:29:15.810 --> 01:29:17.100
<v Speaker 2>He was his name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>michael.</v>

1830
01:29:17.101 --> 01:29:18.640
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a fan.</v>

1831
01:29:18.750 --> 01:29:19.583
<v Speaker 2>it was a famous journalist who wrote a </v>
<v Speaker 2>story in the rolling stones about a </v>

1832
01:29:21.301 --> 01:29:25.230
<v Speaker 2>general and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was embedded with them,</v>

1833
01:29:25.290 --> 01:29:27.690
<v Speaker 2>I believe it was in Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Afghanistan.</v>

1834
01:29:27.720 --> 01:29:30.690
<v Speaker 2>And he was the dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1835
01:29:30.691 --> 01:29:31.790
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't about portrays.</v>

1836
01:29:31.950 --> 01:29:34.090
<v Speaker 2>It was another general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>

1837
01:29:34.340 --> 01:29:34.860
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1838
01:29:34.860 --> 01:29:37.760
<v Speaker 2>there's a different general michael </v>
<v Speaker 2>hastings.</v>

1839
01:29:38.580 --> 01:29:39.413
<v Speaker 2>So he wrote this article about this </v>
<v Speaker 2>general in the general how to step down </v>

1840
01:29:42.240 --> 01:29:47.240
<v Speaker 2>because the general was joking around </v>
<v Speaker 2>about obama or somethIng like that.</v>

1841
01:29:48.361 --> 01:29:50.880
<v Speaker 2>And there was just some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got a little loose.</v>

1842
01:29:51.480 --> 01:29:52.313
<v Speaker 2>What does this close sitting foot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this apparently they tried to say </v>

1843
01:29:57.961 --> 01:30:02.220
<v Speaker 2>that he committed suicide and some </v>
<v Speaker 2>people believe he did commit suicide and</v>

1844
01:30:02.221 --> 01:30:03.054
<v Speaker 2>some people believe so she's just flying</v>
<v Speaker 2>down and just slammed into a tree and </v>

1845
01:30:06.061 --> 01:30:09.330
<v Speaker 2>his fucking car blows up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1846
01:30:09.510 --> 01:30:12.960
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is like in the interest of full</v>

1847
01:30:12.961 --> 01:30:14.070
<v Speaker 2>disclosure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1848
01:30:14.250 --> 01:30:19.110
<v Speaker 2>they apparently said that they found </v>
<v Speaker 2>amphetamines on him,</v>

1849
01:30:19.560 --> 01:30:20.700
<v Speaker 2>on his body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1850
01:30:20.970 --> 01:30:24.810
<v Speaker 2>So that could mean that he was under the</v>
<v Speaker 2>influence of amphetamines.</v>

1851
01:30:24.811 --> 01:30:25.644
<v Speaker 2>What had happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or it could mean that he takes adderall </v>

1852
01:30:28.441 --> 01:30:30.660
<v Speaker 2>because a lot of journalists take </v>
<v Speaker 2>adderall,</v>

1853
01:30:30.661 --> 01:30:33.720
<v Speaker 2>so they found in his system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't necessarily mean he was speed</v>

1854
01:30:33.721 --> 01:30:36.420
<v Speaker 2>it up when he was driving like a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>maniac because he was off the rails.</v>

1855
01:30:36.660 --> 01:30:40.470
<v Speaker 2>It could just easily have meant that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>uses adderall to get his workload done,</v>

1856
01:30:40.471 --> 01:30:42.870
<v Speaker 2>which a shitload of journalists do.</v>

1857
01:30:42.990 --> 01:30:43.823
<v Speaker 2>So it might not have been anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we talked to people that are </v>

1858
01:30:45.391 --> 01:30:46.500
<v Speaker 2>experts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boy,</v>

1859
01:30:46.510 --> 01:30:50.430
<v Speaker 2>people that are experts that weigh in on</v>
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy car crash evidence.</v>

1860
01:30:50.431 --> 01:30:51.264
<v Speaker 2>They're weirdos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to find like who's right and </v>

1861
01:30:53.431 --> 01:30:54.264
<v Speaker 2>who's wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but some people said that the way the </v>

1862
01:30:57.030 --> 01:30:57.863
<v Speaker 2>car had a separate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way the engine had exploded and </v>

1863
01:31:01.020 --> 01:31:04.590
<v Speaker 2>launched itself from the car indicate </v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of an explosion more.</v>

1864
01:31:04.591 --> 01:31:07.470
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't impact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1865
01:31:07.680 --> 01:31:10.980
<v Speaker 2>because it just all hit the hit the tree</v>
<v Speaker 2>and blew up all at once,</v>

1866
01:31:11.160 --> 01:31:12.750
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could be bullshit,</v>

1867
01:31:12.990 --> 01:31:15.810
<v Speaker 2>but it is fucked up because the guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrote a very,</v>

1868
01:31:16.020 --> 01:31:16.853
<v Speaker 2>he wrote a very scathing article about </v>
<v Speaker 2>this general and I made the general </v>

1869
01:31:19.711 --> 01:31:20.544
<v Speaker 2>retire and I know that guy got a shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>ton of death threats and he was telling </v>

1870
01:31:23.221 --> 01:31:24.054
<v Speaker 2>everybody that if somebody kills me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like be be sure that I didn't kill </v>

1871
01:31:27.901 --> 01:31:28.734
<v Speaker 2>myself.</v>

1872
01:31:30.330 --> 01:31:31.500
<v Speaker 2>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>

1873
01:31:31.620 --> 01:31:33.540
<v Speaker 2>They can take over your car because your</v>
<v Speaker 2>car is a computer.</v>

1874
01:31:33.810 --> 01:31:36.720
<v Speaker 2>Your car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of cars today are connected to the</v>

1875
01:31:36.721 --> 01:31:38.820
<v Speaker 2>internet through wifi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of cars,</v>

1876
01:31:39.240 --> 01:31:41.400
<v Speaker 2>like they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have their own wifi hub.</v>

1877
01:31:41.670 --> 01:31:44.990
<v Speaker 2>Like you buy a new escalate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it comes with a wifi hubs.</v>

1878
01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:45.833
<v Speaker 2>All the people in the car can play on </v>
<v Speaker 2>their ipads or whatever while you drive </v>

1879
01:31:48.591 --> 01:31:51.660
<v Speaker 2>and you link up to the internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's on the um,</v>

1880
01:31:52.110 --> 01:31:54.660
<v Speaker 2>on the actual car itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a computer.</v>

1881
01:31:54.960 --> 01:31:56.760
<v Speaker 2>It's a computer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's connected to the net,</v>

1882
01:31:57.170 --> 01:31:59.060
<v Speaker 2>driving around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1883
01:31:59.350 --> 01:32:00.070
<v Speaker 2>somebody just gets</v>

1884
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:03.620
<v Speaker 5>in there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's,</v>

1885
01:32:04.330 --> 01:32:06.610
<v Speaker 5>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's no bounds at this point.</v>

1886
01:32:09.220 --> 01:32:14.220
<v Speaker 5>How can you keep things organized?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Probably isn't the right way,</v>

1887
01:32:14.590 --> 01:32:19.590
<v Speaker 5>but how do you keep us all alive without</v>
<v Speaker 5>surrendering personal freedom?</v>

1888
01:32:20.021 --> 01:32:20.771
<v Speaker 5>LIke boom,</v>
<v Speaker 5>boom,</v>

1889
01:32:20.771 --> 01:32:21.190
<v Speaker 5>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what?</v>

1890
01:32:21.190 --> 01:32:23.830
<v Speaker 5>Can we kind of have a crazy what's going</v>
<v Speaker 5>on with your question?</v>

1891
01:32:24.440 --> 01:32:27.960
<v Speaker 5>Just stop working on to see what the </v>
<v Speaker 5>deal was.</v>

1892
01:32:28.050 --> 01:32:30.190
<v Speaker 5>We don't have to talk about what you,</v>

1893
01:32:30.410 --> 01:32:31.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>

1894
01:32:32.210 --> 01:32:34.850
<v Speaker 2>you don't really have an answer to that </v>
<v Speaker 2>question because we don't even know what</v>

1895
01:32:34.851 --> 01:32:36.230
<v Speaker 2>they could really do right now.</v>

1896
01:32:36.650 --> 01:32:37.483
<v Speaker 5>One,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially if part of the important </v>

1897
01:32:38.841 --> 01:32:41.480
<v Speaker 5>thing we need to accept is that we're </v>
<v Speaker 5>all the same thing,</v>

1898
01:32:41.900 --> 01:32:42.733
<v Speaker 5>then we have to accept that we all have </v>
<v Speaker 5>to start acting like the same thing at </v>

1899
01:32:45.501 --> 01:32:46.700
<v Speaker 5>the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1900
01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:49.490
<v Speaker 2>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a very good point.</v>

1901
01:32:49.491 --> 01:32:50.324
<v Speaker 2>but it gets lost when you start talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about people that are in the military </v>

1902
01:32:53.430 --> 01:32:54.263
<v Speaker 2>and that are dealing with a national </v>
<v Speaker 2>emergencies or national security </v>

1903
01:32:59.421 --> 01:33:00.254
<v Speaker 2>situations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you make a general retire </v>

1904
01:33:03.560 --> 01:33:08.560
<v Speaker 2>because you um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you chose to write an article about some</v>

1905
01:33:08.811 --> 01:33:09.644
<v Speaker 2>things that you heard him say that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>gets him fired and then somehow or </v>

1906
01:33:11.961 --> 01:33:14.960
<v Speaker 2>another the military becomes compromised</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's very important.</v>

1907
01:33:14.961 --> 01:33:16.940
<v Speaker 2>Leader is no longer in a position of </v>
<v Speaker 2>power.</v>

1908
01:33:17.450 --> 01:33:20.940
<v Speaker 2>That's a very tricky situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very tricky.</v>

1909
01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.330
<v Speaker 2>You did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you dId get the scoop and you did get to</v>

1910
01:33:23.331 --> 01:33:25.580
<v Speaker 2>say how this guy was communicating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1911
01:33:25.760 --> 01:33:26.593
<v Speaker 2>candidly,</v>

1912
01:33:27.690 --> 01:33:29.370
<v Speaker 5>but things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>things are happening,</v>

1913
01:33:29.940 --> 01:33:33.780
<v Speaker 5>they're happening interdependently and </v>
<v Speaker 5>also completely and mess.</v>

1914
01:33:33.781 --> 01:33:36.360
<v Speaker 5>Like you can't mess the way that all </v>
<v Speaker 5>these things,</v>

1915
01:33:36.361 --> 01:33:37.141
<v Speaker 5>technology,</v>
<v Speaker 5>baba,</v>

1916
01:33:37.141 --> 01:33:40.530
<v Speaker 5>buzz is developing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But there it is.</v>

1917
01:33:40.710 --> 01:33:43.320
<v Speaker 5>There's no way this dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they can control that much.</v>

1918
01:33:43.321 --> 01:33:46.830
<v Speaker 5>There's no way people can control where </v>
<v Speaker 5>this is going.</v>

1919
01:33:46.831 --> 01:33:49.350
<v Speaker 5>And by this I mean everything to that </v>
<v Speaker 5>degree.</v>

1920
01:33:49.351 --> 01:33:54.351
<v Speaker 5>So you just have to deal with all these </v>
<v Speaker 5>new phenomenon.</v>

1921
01:33:55.050 --> 01:33:55.883
<v Speaker 5>They're happening.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I can't actually remember.</v>

2054
01:40:58.510 --> 01:40:59.343
<v Speaker 1>I think it has tricon resonators showing</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that you want to hear some </v>

2055
01:41:02.681 --> 01:41:03.600
<v Speaker 1>music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what you're getting?</v>

2056
01:41:03.601 --> 01:41:04.121
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2057
01:41:04.121 --> 01:41:05.740
<v Speaker 1>I want to see that guitar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

2058
01:41:06.520 --> 01:41:08.130
<v Speaker 1>that's it right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2059
01:41:08.140 --> 01:41:12.010
<v Speaker 1>that's not it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's hard now.</v>

2060
01:41:12.220 --> 01:41:14.970
<v Speaker 1>I thought a guitar had to be made at of </v>
<v Speaker 1>wood.</v>

2061
01:41:16.200 --> 01:41:18.670
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well this is technically a.</v>

2062
01:41:18.671 --> 01:41:21.220
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a different kind of guitar.</v>

2063
01:41:21.340 --> 01:41:26.340
<v Speaker 4>Some call them dobo definitely not </v>
<v Speaker 4>claiming any cone inside of.</v>

2064
01:41:26.390 --> 01:41:29.020
<v Speaker 4>I feel like I want ben here so I don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>look this up.</v>

2065
01:41:29.021 --> 01:41:29.854
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a resonator inside like a </v>

2066
01:41:32.291 --> 01:41:33.124
<v Speaker 4>speaker inside of see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>see how there's all this kind of mesh </v>

2067
01:41:37.210 --> 01:41:40.060
<v Speaker 4>look.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Will you go back up that one?</v>

2068
01:41:40.090 --> 01:41:40.923
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2069
01:41:40.930 --> 01:41:41.763
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's like a built in speaker and you </v>

2070
01:41:43.361 --> 01:41:45.940
<v Speaker 4>can plug them in so they're electric as </v>
<v Speaker 4>a speaker,</v>

2071
01:41:45.941 --> 01:41:48.850
<v Speaker 4>like a car speaker,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a stereo speaker.</v>

2072
01:41:49.330 --> 01:41:51.020
<v Speaker 4>I'm not necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2073
01:41:51.160 --> 01:41:54.070
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Without electronics.</v>

2074
01:41:54.190 --> 01:41:55.023
<v Speaker 4>There's a cone inside is that the sound </v>
<v Speaker 4>resonates louder like a banjo kind of a </v>

2075
01:42:00.431 --> 01:42:01.960
<v Speaker 4>little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>

2076
01:42:01.990 --> 01:42:05.220
<v Speaker 1>so it's not like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a stereo special.</v>

2077
01:42:05.230 --> 01:42:07.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm really sorry if I just put your </v>
<v Speaker 1>power,</v>

2078
01:42:07.500 --> 01:42:09.080
<v Speaker 1>the pitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well jamie's a,</v>

2079
01:42:09.300 --> 01:42:10.480
<v Speaker 1>the actual audio</v>

2080
01:42:10.580 --> 01:42:11.413
<v Speaker 4>powered,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it has a specific tone to it that </v>

2081
01:42:13.521 --> 01:42:17.330
<v Speaker 4>isn't like your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your regular acoustic or electric guitar</v>

2082
01:42:17.570 --> 01:42:18.403
<v Speaker 4>and when you plug it in it sounds </v>
<v Speaker 4>amazing and it has sort of like a down </v>

2083
01:42:21.231 --> 01:42:22.820
<v Speaker 4>homey vibe and it's beautiful.</v>

2084
01:42:24.180 --> 01:42:29.180
<v Speaker 1>Not interesting down homey vibe like </v>
<v Speaker 1>down home me music,</v>

2085
01:42:31.230 --> 01:42:34.380
<v Speaker 1>like acoustic music is like down homie </v>
<v Speaker 1>music,</v>

2086
01:42:34.381 --> 01:42:35.214
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2087
01:42:35.470 --> 01:42:36.700
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2088
01:42:37.120 --> 01:42:41.330
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean folk music and soul music or down</v>

2089
01:42:41.331 --> 01:42:41.790
<v Speaker 4>home,</v>

2090
01:42:41.790 --> 01:42:45.360
<v Speaker 1>resonator for guitar cover,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cover plate for biscuit.</v>

2091
01:42:45.900 --> 01:42:48.480
<v Speaker 1>Butchered the whole explanation of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>an nationalism.</v>

2092
01:42:49.010 --> 01:42:50.520
<v Speaker 1>She nailed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She nailed it.</v>

2093
01:42:50.700 --> 01:42:52.590
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So is there any word on that as the back</v>

2094
01:42:52.591 --> 01:42:55.420
<v Speaker 1>of that thing and the headstock and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>neck?</v>

2095
01:42:55.530 --> 01:42:57.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to pee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the body's metal.</v>

2096
01:42:58.140 --> 01:42:58.973
<v Speaker 1>That thing's insane looking man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what kind of a different sound </v>

2097
01:43:04.260 --> 01:43:06.620
<v Speaker 1>does this thing make than a regular </v>
<v Speaker 1>guitar?</v>

2098
01:43:08.990 --> 01:43:13.990
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's louder.</v>

2099
01:43:14.910 --> 01:43:17.010
<v Speaker 1>It cuts a lot more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more resonant.</v>

2100
01:43:17.280 --> 01:43:20.160
<v Speaker 1>It's got a metal sound to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

2101
01:43:20.161 --> 01:43:22.930
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one,</v>

2102
01:43:23.340 --> 01:43:25.290
<v Speaker 1>if I had a slide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These things are great for plants.</v>

2103
01:43:25.291 --> 01:43:30.291
<v Speaker 1>Slide with a because jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you got?</v>

2104
01:43:31.160 --> 01:43:33.000
<v Speaker 1>A lighter?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably fucked it up,</v>

2105
01:43:33.540 --> 01:43:36.340
<v Speaker 1>but you can kind of wander around one or</v>
<v Speaker 1>a flat round,</v>

2106
01:43:37.320 --> 01:43:42.320
<v Speaker 1>but you can kind hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe sound like shit,</v>

2107
01:43:42.601 --> 01:43:45.150
<v Speaker 1>but you know what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like some old school blue shit.</v>

2108
01:43:45.151 --> 01:43:48.020
<v Speaker 1>What does that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are some around.</v>

2109
01:43:48.030 --> 01:43:53.030
<v Speaker 1>Let's try that round cigar thing cohiba </v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever I hear that kind of shit.</v>

2110
01:43:57.471 --> 01:44:01.380
<v Speaker 1>I think of blues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2111
01:44:01.500 --> 01:44:04.940
<v Speaker 1>Because all that Robert Johnson stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>slide all that.</v>

2112
01:44:04.941 --> 01:44:06.260
<v Speaker 1>He probably didn't have resonated </v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

2113
01:44:06.950 --> 01:44:07.960
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2114
01:44:08.170 --> 01:44:10.190
<v Speaker 1>That's a complaint site,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a.</v>

2115
01:44:20.430 --> 01:44:22.500
<v Speaker 1>Are you with John Lee hooker?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2116
01:44:22.620 --> 01:44:27.620
<v Speaker 1>My is he still around maybe 10 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>

2117
01:44:30.411 --> 01:44:31.244
<v Speaker 1>Like an eight because he was old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was playing when he's in his </v>

2118
01:44:32.331 --> 01:44:33.164
<v Speaker 1>nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't discover them until it was </v>

2119
01:44:36.681 --> 01:44:39.260
<v Speaker 1>probably in his eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boom,</v>

2120
01:44:39.290 --> 01:44:40.011
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>

2121
01:44:40.011 --> 01:44:40.844
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2122
01:44:43.490 --> 01:44:44.900
<v Speaker 1>he could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what this is.</v>

2123
01:44:45.220 --> 01:44:46.970
<v Speaker 1>This will be big upside on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gary.</v>

2124
01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:48.980
<v Speaker 1>When I thought we said gary for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first time,</v>

2125
01:44:49.420 --> 01:44:51.710
<v Speaker 1>he was just acoustic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We played the show with him.</v>

2126
01:44:51.711 --> 01:44:52.544
<v Speaker 1>This was like 2011 or something and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>made me feel like John Lee hooker </v>

2127
01:44:56.630 --> 01:44:57.463
<v Speaker 1>because it was just him and there's this</v>
<v Speaker 1>hypnosis that he can kind of set over </v>

2128
01:45:01.461 --> 01:45:02.560
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2129
01:45:02.561 --> 01:45:04.090
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like a real blues.</v>

2130
01:45:04.150 --> 01:45:08.180
<v Speaker 1>That's where you get deeper into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These guys could really play that music.</v>

2131
01:45:08.650 --> 01:45:09.830
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>John lee hooker.</v>

2132
01:45:09.831 --> 01:45:11.780
<v Speaker 1>You listened to it and you kind of like </v>
<v Speaker 1>in trance.</v>

<v Speaker 3>to sing the words properly and I had to </v>

<v Speaker 3>the case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thousands of people enjoyed that.</v>

2151

<v Speaker 3>You can't control and you definitely </v>

2157
01:47:24.271 --> 01:47:25.830
<v Speaker 3>can't argue with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2158
01:47:25.860 --> 01:47:29.670
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is an effort to not care because I.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's because you're going to care.</v>

2164
01:47:41.340 --> 01:47:42.173
<v Speaker 3>It's about recognizing what that person </v>
<v Speaker 3>is and then not letting him into your </v>

2165
01:47:44.611 --> 01:47:45.740
<v Speaker 3>house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Agreed.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You know what that is?</v>

2167
01:47:47.251 --> 01:47:49.620
<v Speaker 3>It's a dummy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just want to get mad about stuff.</v>

2168
01:47:49.860 --> 01:47:50.693
<v Speaker 3>Especially if you found out what it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you were just checking the lyrics </v>

2169
01:47:53.101 --> 01:47:53.934
<v Speaker 3>to a song that you'd never sang before </v>
<v Speaker 3>and was singing live with Gary Clark jr </v>

<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

<v Speaker 3>time because he can't share what he's </v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

01:48:44.620 --> 01:48:45.453
<v Speaker 3>Like if I was batman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I can tell you and you </v>

01:48:49.040 --> 01:48:52.650
<v Speaker 3>You already are batman because people </v>
<v Speaker 3>just didn't know.</v>

2187
01:48:52.651 --> 01:48:53.750
<v Speaker 3>Did you ever see that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a.</v>

2188
01:48:54.160 --> 01:48:56.130
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess I was actually comic book.</v>

2189
01:48:56.160 --> 01:49:01.160
<v Speaker 3>It was a a forgetful professor was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>professor and in the comic book this guy</v>

2190
01:49:02.101 --> 01:49:02.934
<v Speaker 3>was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was forgetful about all these </v>

2191
01:49:05.071 --> 01:49:07.260
<v Speaker 3>different things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's like super genius professor and</v>

2192
01:49:07.261 --> 01:49:11.370
<v Speaker 3>at the end of the comic book he </v>
<v Speaker 3>recognized that he was actually an alien</v>

2193
01:49:11.371 --> 01:49:15.360
<v Speaker 3>from another planet come that came down </v>
<v Speaker 3>to earth to help us innovate,</v>

2194
01:49:15.510 --> 01:49:16.343
<v Speaker 3>but he forgot to jail for an alien from </v>
<v Speaker 3>another planet because you know it's </v>

2195
01:49:27.781 --> 01:49:28.614
<v Speaker 3>true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You guys should do more of those weird </v>

2196
01:49:31.321 --> 01:49:34.200
<v Speaker 3>little downtown shows though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We should shut.</v>

2197
01:49:34.210 --> 01:49:35.580
<v Speaker 3>Those were fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those were.</v>

2198
01:49:35.581 --> 01:49:37.210
<v Speaker 3>That was so strange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was really fun.</v>

2199
01:49:37.211 --> 01:49:37.920
<v Speaker 3>Night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>midnight,</v>

01:49:37.920 --> 01:49:39.510
<v Speaker 3>and it was so great because you were </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

2201
01:49:39.590 --> 01:49:40.530
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was great.</v>

2202
01:49:40.531 --> 01:49:41.820
<v Speaker 3>What a great time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was awesome.</v>

2203
01:49:41.990 --> 01:49:43.890
<v Speaker 3>It was fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was pretty fucking bad ass.</v>

2204
01:49:43.891 --> 01:49:44.724
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was amazing.</v>

2205
01:49:44.730 --> 01:49:46.830
<v Speaker 3>Intimate shows are so big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're so,</v>

2206
01:49:47.380 --> 01:49:47.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you</v>

2207
01:49:47.980 --> 01:49:51.340
<v Speaker 1>almost kind of have to do them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you just j lo,</v>

2208
01:49:51.341 --> 01:49:52.174
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing and you're on these big </v>
<v Speaker 1>gas giant stages for the rest of your </v>

2209
01:49:55.180 --> 01:49:56.040
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Giants.</v>

2210
01:49:56.130 --> 01:49:58.710
<v Speaker 1>Even when I'm mad if she's doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>

2211
01:49:58.780 --> 01:50:00.910
<v Speaker 1>she's going to be like separated from </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody.</v>

2212
01:50:01.200 --> 01:50:02.033
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The throwing couldn't close to rose </v>

2213
01:50:04.451 --> 01:50:05.960
<v Speaker 1>pedals that are feet and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2214
01:50:06.170 --> 01:50:10.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think that was as attractive to</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is.</v>

2215
01:50:10.570 --> 01:50:11.403
<v Speaker 1>Hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's the counterpoint is that </v>

2216
01:50:14.531 --> 01:50:15.364
<v Speaker 1>thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seems like that's like the worst thing </v>

2217
01:50:17.261 --> 01:50:18.094
<v Speaker 1>that could ever happen to you because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets so separated for everybody that </v>

2218
01:50:20.681 --> 01:50:21.514
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll put some giant ass stage and </v>

2219
01:50:23.110 --> 01:50:25.270
<v Speaker 1>everywhere you go you can interact with </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

2220
01:50:25.590 --> 01:50:29.500
<v Speaker 1>make all that Roger Waters last or two </v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks ago.</v>

2221
01:50:29.501 --> 01:50:31.510
<v Speaker 1>And it was incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tony,</v>

2222
01:50:31.511 --> 01:50:33.200
<v Speaker 1>when he said it was insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my god.</v>

2223
01:50:33.640 --> 01:50:35.570
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a.</v>

2224
01:50:35.740 --> 01:50:37.070
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

2225
01:50:37.710 --> 01:50:38.543
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a reason that he's doing what </v>

2226
01:50:40.001 --> 01:50:40.834
<v Speaker 1>he's doing and people are coming to see </v>
<v Speaker 1>him because it's incredible and it's </v>

2227
01:50:43.091 --> 01:50:43.924
<v Speaker 1>authentic and it's raw and like that man</v>
<v Speaker 1>has obviously he has teams around him </v>

2228
01:50:47.891 --> 01:50:48.940
<v Speaker 1>that helped build that show.</v>

2229
01:50:48.940 --> 01:50:52.720
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't do that by himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was,</v>

2230
01:50:53.440 --> 01:50:56.980
<v Speaker 1>oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't white rose pedals.</v>

2231
01:50:57.630 --> 01:51:01.600
<v Speaker 1>It was definitely a different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a different thing.</v>

2232
01:51:01.750 --> 01:51:03.490
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that fast food thing we were kind of</v>

2233
01:51:03.491 --> 01:51:06.160
<v Speaker 1>talking about earlier and I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a place for that too.</v>

2234
01:51:06.161 --> 01:51:08.800
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you're fucking starving and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you need something right now.</v>

2235
01:51:09.160 --> 01:51:12.940
<v Speaker 1>There's also like a lot of money in </v>
<v Speaker 1>being that icon,</v>

2236
01:51:12.970 --> 01:51:14.560
<v Speaker 1>that diva,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that thing,</v>

2237
01:51:14.590 --> 01:51:15.423
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's very attractive position </v>

2238
01:51:16.991 --> 01:51:17.824
<v Speaker 1>to try to attain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like you just run a little </v>

2239
01:51:21.101 --> 01:51:23.930
<v Speaker 1>clue to close to the sun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>burn the wax off your waist,</v>

2240
01:51:23.931 --> 01:51:26.680
<v Speaker 1>and some of it's authentic in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of it is totally.</v>

2241
01:51:26.681 --> 01:51:27.514
<v Speaker 1>You are a machine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are part of the manufactured </v>

2242
01:51:29.800 --> 01:51:33.910
<v Speaker 1>idealism that you represent and that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>a heavy burden.</v>

2243
01:51:33.940 --> 01:51:34.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

2244
01:51:34.900 --> 01:51:37.600
<v Speaker 1>it's probably not on anybody who </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably not enough.</v>

2245
01:51:37.600 --> 01:51:40.330
<v Speaker 1>Antick is people's ambition to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

2246
01:51:40.570 --> 01:51:44.500
<v Speaker 1>I think the people in those positions </v>
<v Speaker 1>are so fucking ravenous for that kind of</v>

2247
01:51:44.501 --> 01:51:45.334
<v Speaker 1>attention and that's the only way you </v>
<v Speaker 1>would possibly climb to the top of that </v>

2248
01:51:47.771 --> 01:51:50.770
<v Speaker 1>mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't be fucking focused.</v>

2249
01:51:51.480 --> 01:51:54.580
<v Speaker 1>I think some people are are manipulated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2250
01:51:54.581 --> 01:51:55.660
<v Speaker 1>I think some people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jackson,</v>

2251
01:51:55.810 --> 01:51:56.643
<v Speaker 1>I think some people have an idea of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>art and they're also exploited within </v>

2252
01:52:00.161 --> 01:52:00.994
<v Speaker 1>that realm because some parts of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>record industry are fucking insidious </v>

2253
01:52:05.910 --> 01:52:06.743
<v Speaker 1>and they take like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember you were talking about that </v>

2254
01:52:08.291 --> 01:52:11.920
<v Speaker 1>documentary with these 15 year old kids </v>
<v Speaker 1>that were so talented,</v>

2255
01:52:12.160 --> 01:52:16.630
<v Speaker 1>but they were clearly just getting just </v>
<v Speaker 1>sucked into the thing.</v>

2256
01:52:16.990 --> 01:52:17.823
<v Speaker 1>You're too young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're too young to know what you're </v>

2257
01:52:18.971 --> 01:52:20.410
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just no if,</v>

2258
01:52:20.411 --> 01:52:21.244
<v Speaker 1>ands or buts about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In order to make the decision to be a </v>

2259
01:52:23.200 --> 01:52:26.620
<v Speaker 1>giant like Michael Jackson when we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about jackson five earlier,</v>

2260
01:52:26.950 --> 01:52:30.700
<v Speaker 1>like when you sing an abc,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was a fucking baby.</v>

2261
01:52:30.940 --> 01:52:34.600
<v Speaker 1>He was baby baby and he was on tv.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2262
01:52:34.660 --> 01:52:36.580
<v Speaker 1>he was on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a huge star,</v>

2263
01:52:36.610 --> 01:52:37.443
<v Speaker 1>but also he had his family running the </v>
<v Speaker 1>show and it was like a really fucked up </v>

2264
01:52:40.391 --> 01:52:43.000
<v Speaker 1>dynamic and so it was almost like his.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2265
01:52:43.090 --> 01:52:44.920
<v Speaker 1>don't get me wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his talent was undeniable,</v>

2266
01:52:44.930 --> 01:52:46.340
<v Speaker 1>but like his family</v>

2267
01:52:46.340 --> 01:52:48.380
<v Speaker 4>were the record industry in that </v>
<v Speaker 4>respect.</v>

2268
01:52:48.381 --> 01:52:48.650
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2269
01:52:48.650 --> 01:52:53.370
<v Speaker 2>Whose talent was so undeniable that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>was the youngest one and he got to sing.</v>

2270
01:52:53.850 --> 01:52:58.290
<v Speaker 2>Could you imagine you grew up with four </v>
<v Speaker 2>bad motherfuckers as brothers.</v>

2271
01:52:58.291 --> 01:53:01.860
<v Speaker 2>Your dad is a professional musician and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you are so good.</v>

2272
01:53:01.861 --> 01:53:02.320
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2273
01:53:02.320 --> 01:53:03.153
<v Speaker 2>let him say like everybody else wants to</v>
<v Speaker 2>want them to saying they all did their </v>

2274
01:53:06.271 --> 01:53:07.104
<v Speaker 2>solo projects afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't say shit while michael had </v>

2275
01:53:09.901 --> 01:53:11.480
<v Speaker 2>the microphone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like I'm saying,</v>

2276
01:53:11.990 --> 01:53:16.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying just let him sing and people </v>
<v Speaker 2>reacted to them real way.</v>

2277
01:53:16.051 --> 01:53:16.561
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2278
01:53:16.561 --> 01:53:17.450
<v Speaker 2>that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh man,</v>

2279
01:53:17.700 --> 01:53:20.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the exploitative aspect and then</v>

2280
01:53:20.011 --> 01:53:21.840
<v Speaker 2>it's like everybody want to fucking see </v>
<v Speaker 2>him sing.</v>

2281
01:53:21.841 --> 01:53:23.970
<v Speaker 2>I wish I saw him saying it was two </v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

2282
01:53:24.060 --> 01:53:26.820
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was this emergence of this incredible</v>

2283
01:53:26.821 --> 01:53:27.654
<v Speaker 2>sound that came out of this one person </v>
<v Speaker 2>and all the different projects that he </v>

2284
01:53:30.061 --> 01:53:32.940
<v Speaker 2>was involved in and then it was also the</v>
<v Speaker 2>tragic,</v>

2285
01:53:33.570 --> 01:53:34.403
<v Speaker 2>almost like decimating of a potential </v>
<v Speaker 2>life because his life only existed so </v>

2286
01:53:39.481 --> 01:53:42.620
<v Speaker 2>strongly in the public eye that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't exist anywhere else in the,</v>

2287
01:53:42.621 --> 01:53:44.670
<v Speaker 2>in a normal form outside.</v>

2288
01:53:44.670 --> 01:53:45.503
<v Speaker 2>It was just a chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a mess of hanging out with kids and </v>

2289
01:53:48.300 --> 01:53:49.133
<v Speaker 2>weird relationships with women that </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't seem real and living in an </v>

2290
01:53:52.201 --> 01:53:54.060
<v Speaker 2>amusement park.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just a mess.</v>

2291
01:53:54.090 --> 01:53:54.923
<v Speaker 2>It was just a total disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like everything outside of the magic </v>

2292
01:53:59.281 --> 01:54:02.640
<v Speaker 2>that he did in the public eye was just </v>
<v Speaker 2>hell.</v>

2293
01:54:03.120 --> 01:54:06.150
<v Speaker 2>It's really weird because what he did in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the public eye,</v>

2294
01:54:06.210 --> 01:54:09.270
<v Speaker 2>like thriller and beat it and all those </v>
<v Speaker 2>different things.</v>

2295
01:54:09.271 --> 01:54:11.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean they were so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so intense.</v>

2296
01:54:12.180 --> 01:54:13.013
<v Speaker 2>Like I was in high school when all that </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff was going on and I remember just </v>

2297
01:54:17.260 --> 01:54:20.250
<v Speaker 2>just watching like thriller on </v>
<v Speaker 2>television,</v>

2298
01:54:20.280 --> 01:54:21.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they had the premiere,</v>

2299
01:54:21.271 --> 01:54:24.090
<v Speaker 2>the music video and everybody sat around</v>
<v Speaker 2>and watched thriller when it came out.</v>

2300
01:54:24.091 --> 01:54:28.000
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing like that ever ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was crazy.</v>

2301
01:54:28.020 --> 01:54:30.990
<v Speaker 2>Like sorta like when hendrix came along,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was nothing like that before.</v>

2302
01:54:31.200 --> 01:54:32.520
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when Michael Jackson came along,</v>

2303
01:54:32.550 --> 01:54:34.030
<v Speaker 2>there was nothing like that before </v>
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>

2304
01:54:34.031 --> 01:54:35.160
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>

2305
01:54:35.340 --> 01:54:36.173
<v Speaker 2>Like someone had taken the whole thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>and put it into this totally new </v>

2306
01:54:38.581 --> 01:54:42.750
<v Speaker 2>package.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas this feminine guy and he had one</v>

2307
01:54:42.751 --> 01:54:45.630
<v Speaker 2>glove on and he was dancing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody wanted to move like,</v>

2308
01:54:45.631 --> 01:54:46.141
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was like,</v>

2309
01:54:46.141 --> 01:54:47.200
<v Speaker 2>what in the fuck is</v>

2310
01:54:48.150 --> 01:54:48.983
<v Speaker 4>back to your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like freddie mercury kinda dick out </v>

2311
01:54:50.611 --> 01:54:51.444
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like he did what he wanted to do </v>

2312
01:54:54.121 --> 01:54:56.610
<v Speaker 4>and he wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was iconic because of it.</v>

2313
01:54:57.030 --> 01:54:58.440
<v Speaker 4>I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's part of it.</v>

2314
01:54:58.441 --> 01:55:01.020
<v Speaker 4>It's like you just have to own it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2315
01:55:01.030 --> 01:55:01.270
<v Speaker 4>what he</v>

2316
01:55:01.270 --> 01:55:06.270
<v Speaker 5>did it on a level that was undeniable,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just like you talked about before,</v>

2317
01:55:06.971 --> 01:55:09.370
<v Speaker 5>because he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because of his ambition,</v>

2318
01:55:09.400 --> 01:55:13.570
<v Speaker 5>it wasn't just I'm going to be me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was like I'm going gonna be me to the</v>

2319
01:55:13.571 --> 01:55:17.320
<v Speaker 5>furthest extent that I possibly fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>can and this is what happened.</v>

2320
01:55:17.620 --> 01:55:19.510
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have a friend who went to his house up</v>

2321
01:55:19.511 --> 01:55:20.344
<v Speaker 5>in los olivos and they went,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they toward his dance studio and he had </v>

2322
01:55:24.671 --> 01:55:25.504
<v Speaker 5>this private dance studio in this mirror</v>
<v Speaker 5>is against the wall and there's this </v>

2323
01:55:27.101 --> 01:55:29.650
<v Speaker 5>groove in the floor and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2324
01:55:29.651 --> 01:55:30.484
<v Speaker 5>he was later in his life at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he had worn out a part of the floor </v>

2325
01:55:33.370 --> 01:55:35.320
<v Speaker 5>from just practicing his shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

2326
01:55:35.390 --> 01:55:38.050
<v Speaker 5>This is way beyond his teens and </v>
<v Speaker 5>twenties.</v>

2327
01:55:38.080 --> 01:55:41.710
<v Speaker 5>That's just who he was all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2328
01:55:41.750 --> 01:55:44.040
<v Speaker 5>people don't respect a song.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dragon</v>

2329
01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:49.040
<v Speaker 3>attack,</v>
<v Speaker 3>attack.</v>

2330
01:55:49.530 --> 01:55:53.660
<v Speaker 3>I know the troll song ogre battle your </v>
<v Speaker 3>battle.</v>

2331
01:55:53.680 --> 01:55:54.513
<v Speaker 3>It's one of those songs to people for </v>
<v Speaker 3>god and he will play with the people on </v>

2332
01:55:58.141 --> 01:55:59.940
<v Speaker 3>youtube can hear it and we'll probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to.</v>

2333
01:56:00.230 --> 01:56:01.410
<v Speaker 3>We can play it for us though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2334
01:56:01.860 --> 01:56:06.330
<v Speaker 3>We have to do some fancy editing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably control for everything.</v>

2335
01:56:06.331 --> 01:56:11.120
<v Speaker 3>We show a video of a caterpillar and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>get yanked off youtube the last time we.</v>

2336
01:56:11.210 --> 01:56:14.280
<v Speaker 3>We get yanked off youtube for stuff like</v>
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

2337
01:56:14.310 --> 01:56:15.143
<v Speaker 3>when we put things on the air that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>on youtube that someone else has </v>

2338
01:56:18.660 --> 01:56:20.520

<v Speaker 7>things have a time limit where they're </v>

2380
01:58:57.480 --> 01:59:00.090

<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Just do you have your permanent for a </v>

2411
02:00:28.131 --> 02:00:30.740
<v Speaker 7>certain number of deer that you can.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Not in lanai.</v>

2412
02:00:30.890 --> 02:00:32.630
<v Speaker 7>In lanai,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they don't have any predators,</v>

2413
02:00:32.660 --> 02:00:34.130
<v Speaker 7>so you could really.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I only shot one of them.</v>

2414
02:00:34.131 --> 02:00:34.964
<v Speaker 7>They're really hard to get with a bow </v>
<v Speaker 7>and arrow and it's hard to get close to </v>

2415
02:00:36.771 --> 02:00:37.730
<v Speaker 7>them.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They're super.</v>

2416
02:00:37.731 --> 02:00:39.590
<v Speaker 7>Well they.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They evolved with tigers.</v>

2417
02:00:40.490 --> 02:00:41.323
<v Speaker 7>Will these.</v>

2418
02:00:43.180 --> 02:00:46.020
<v Speaker 7>They're so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I this happened more than once.</v>

2419
02:00:46.021 --> 02:00:49.750
<v Speaker 7>I shot at one and it ran away from the </v>
<v Speaker 7>arrow.</v>

2420
02:00:50.610 --> 02:00:51.443
<v Speaker 7>The arrow is going 200 and switch arrows</v>
<v Speaker 7>because I heavier arrows that go 245 </v>

2421
02:00:56.941 --> 02:00:57.774
<v Speaker 7>feet a second and in the mid hunt we had</v>
<v Speaker 7>to switch to these other errors that go </v>

2422
02:01:00.901 --> 02:01:01.734
<v Speaker 7>275 feet a second.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I had a gain an extra 30 feet a second </v>

2423
02:01:04.590 --> 02:01:07.290
<v Speaker 7>because the deer would even then they </v>
<v Speaker 7>still duct it.</v>

2424
02:01:07.560 --> 02:01:08.393
<v Speaker 7>They would look at the arrow coming </v>
<v Speaker 7>their way and get the fuck out of dodge </v>

2425
02:01:11.430 --> 02:01:12.270
<v Speaker 7>bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Are you kidding me?</v>

2426
02:01:12.900 --> 02:01:15.780
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're fascinated fast the.</v>

2427
02:01:15.840 --> 02:01:18.710
<v Speaker 7>Because they literally evolved running </v>
<v Speaker 7>away from tigers.</v>

2428
02:01:20.390 --> 02:01:21.223
<v Speaker 7>Crazy man.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That there's any chance that it's going </v>

2429
02:01:22.641 --> 02:01:24.920
<v Speaker 7>off anytime soon.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's no one around.</v>

2430
02:01:25.360 --> 02:01:27.680
<v Speaker 7>We don't have.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We've got issues folks.</v>

2431
02:01:27.760 --> 02:01:28.850
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we can play with the soundtrack.</v>

2432
02:01:28.900 --> 02:01:30.360
<v Speaker 7>We don't have to play.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We could do.</v>

2433
02:01:30.380 --> 02:01:32.930
<v Speaker 7>We could.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We could definitely just keep doing it.</v>

2434
02:01:33.110 --> 02:01:36.020
<v Speaker 7>Does it bother you that this thing has </v>
<v Speaker 7>gone kind of faded into the background?</v>

2435

<v Speaker 7>Weird drinks at this point?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I feel warm.</v>

<v Speaker 7>river that's very brackish and the </v>
<v Speaker 7>tigers drink the salt water and because </v>

2455
02:03:02.961 --> 02:03:03.794
<v Speaker 7>of the typhoons,</v>

<v Speaker 1>button.</v>

2615
02:10:30.881 --> 02:10:33.830
<v Speaker 1>It's an ingenious device that my </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends,</v>

2616
02:10:33.831 --> 02:10:37.640
<v Speaker 1>the rivets up in alberta told me about </v>

2620
02:10:48.021 --> 02:10:49.790
<v Speaker 1>and it heats up that blue pack.</v>

2621
02:10:49.790 --> 02:10:52.220
<v Speaker 1>Go back to that thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that blue pad.</v>

<v Speaker 1>After awhile they become white in that </v>

2623
02:10:55.461 --> 02:10:58.160
<v Speaker 1>blue pad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Puts out this fine mist.</v>

2624
02:10:58.400 --> 02:10:59.330
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it burns.</v>

2625
02:10:59.360 --> 02:11:01.610

<v Speaker 1>detect,</v>

2626
02:11:01.790 --> 02:11:03.920
<v Speaker 1>but fucking mosquitoes don't want no </v>

<v Speaker 1>somehow or another rep keeps mosquitoes.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good questions.</v>

2636
02:11:34.340 --> 02:11:35.173
<v Speaker 1>Fashion conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When it comes to mosquito protection </v>

2637
02:11:36.411 --> 02:11:38.450
<v Speaker 1>with looking into when we lived in </v>
<v Speaker 1>nashville,</v>

2638
02:11:38.540 --> 02:11:39.373
<v Speaker 1>I would have To wear off for sensitive </v>
<v Speaker 1>skin during the day because I would get </v>

2639
02:11:43.161 --> 02:11:43.994
<v Speaker 1>bit by mosquitoes all day and people </v>
<v Speaker 1>would always tell me that I smelled </v>

<v Speaker 1>markers.</v>

2643
02:11:56.700 --> 02:11:57.533
<v Speaker 1>Good pickup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What smells better than a fresh magic </v>

2644
02:11:59.911 --> 02:12:04.850
<v Speaker 1>word when you pop the top that I don't </v>

<v Speaker 1>Thermacell makes some lawn.</v>

2649
02:12:18.410 --> 02:12:21.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm like those little things that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>stick in the ground,</v>

2650
02:12:21.471 --> 02:12:25.460
<v Speaker 1>like a little lawn lantern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they keep mosquitoes away.</v>

2651
02:12:26.340 --> 02:12:28.940
<v Speaker 1>It's the same terms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So commercial,</v>

2652
02:12:28.970 --> 02:12:29.803

<v Speaker 1>California with the mosquitoes are easy </v>

2653
02:12:32.270 --> 02:12:33.103
<v Speaker 1>with everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking everything except for </v>

2655
02:12:35.451 --> 02:12:36.284
<v Speaker 1>We don't have whether he killed the </v>
<v Speaker 1>spider in my bedroom in the middle of </v>

2656
02:12:38.121 --> 02:12:42.260
<v Speaker 1>the night last week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my curtain window.</v>

2657
02:12:42.890 --> 02:12:46.190
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if you were living in hoonah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alaska grizzly bear,</v>

2658
02:12:46.340 --> 02:12:51.240
<v Speaker 1>you caught them out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The window was right after his app.</v>

2659
02:12:51.360 --> 02:12:55.400
<v Speaker 1>Like if you were like screaming from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>spider and you broke the curtain and you</v>

2660
02:12:55.401 --> 02:12:57.760
<v Speaker 1>looked out the window as the bear was in</v>
<v Speaker 1>full charge it.</v>

2661
02:12:57.770 --> 02:12:59.030
<v Speaker 1>We'll put it all in perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Witness.</v>

2662
02:12:59.031 --> 02:12:59.910
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What jim like,</v>

2663
02:13:00.110 --> 02:13:02.080
<v Speaker 1>goddammit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really didn't have a big deal.</v>

2664
02:13:02.180 --> 02:13:06.950
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eleven year old hunter.</v>

2665
02:13:07.540 --> 02:13:10.640
<v Speaker 1>It seems like you've kind of evaluated </v>
<v Speaker 1>east.</v>

2666
02:13:10.670 --> 02:13:13.340
<v Speaker 1>He's fucking own in that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bitches are on planes.</v>

2667
02:13:13.341 --> 02:13:14.174
<v Speaker 1>Go out and visit this kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's older women that tend towards </v>

2668
02:13:16.311 --> 02:13:17.144
<v Speaker 1>pedophilia that are right now grooming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just didn't want to wait a few </v>

2669
02:13:20.210 --> 02:13:20.841
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what they do.</v>

2670
02:13:20.841 --> 02:13:21.890
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to go to jail.</v>

2671
02:13:22.610 --> 02:13:23.443
<v Speaker 1>So the older girls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just become your friend and mentor </v>

2672
02:13:25.791 --> 02:13:29.230
<v Speaker 1>you for a few years and then when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>hit 18 they just just sucking.</v>

2673
02:13:29.840 --> 02:13:31.740
<v Speaker 1>That's what they tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just telling you.</v>

2674
02:13:32.590 --> 02:13:36.270
<v Speaker 1>That's what I hear because a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>women are realizing wrongly.</v>

2675
02:13:36.270 --> 02:13:38.610
<v Speaker 1>So they get arrested for having sex with</v>
<v Speaker 1>these young boys.</v>

2676
02:13:38.611 --> 02:13:39.444
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just let it go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But once these women do realize that </v>

2677
02:13:44.370 --> 02:13:47.170
<v Speaker 1>there's real consequences to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they do is just to friend them.</v>

2678
02:13:47.610 --> 02:13:49.520
<v Speaker 1>They become friends with these kids that</v>
<v Speaker 1>long.</v>

2679
02:13:50.010 --> 02:13:51.060
<v Speaker 1>They hang it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not dark.</v>

2680
02:13:51.061 --> 02:13:52.110
<v Speaker 1>It's only darkness.</v>

02:16:42.851 --> 02:16:43.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't matter.</v>

2737
02:16:43.841 --> 02:16:46.090
<v Speaker 1>But you just said like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got lucky.</v>

2738
02:16:46.091 --> 02:16:47.680
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you,</v>

2739
02:16:47.740 --> 02:16:51.130
<v Speaker 1>if you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is why like psychics or problem.</v>

2740
02:16:51.131 --> 02:16:54.280
<v Speaker 1>they start leading you and then they </v>
<v Speaker 1>give you a bunch of information,</v>

2741
02:16:54.310 --> 02:16:56.560
<v Speaker 1>you get a bunch of information first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they take a guest,</v>

2742
02:16:56.561 --> 02:16:57.394
<v Speaker 1>like if I told you that I was a psychic </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then we went through this whole </v>

2743
02:17:00.131 --> 02:17:01.930
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sense your dad is.</v>

2744
02:17:02.620 --> 02:17:04.330
<v Speaker 1>He's getting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's getting on,</v>

2745
02:17:04.331 --> 02:17:06.230
<v Speaker 1>but maybe not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he is.</v>

2746
02:17:06.231 --> 02:17:08.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe he's doing well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

2747
02:17:08.021 --> 02:17:08.854
<v Speaker 1>Your dad is.</v>

2748
02:17:09.190 --> 02:17:10.880
<v Speaker 1>My dad's really older.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

2749
02:17:10.910 --> 02:17:11.531
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

2750
02:17:11.531 --> 02:17:13.750
<v Speaker 1>I feel like he's older.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Am I onto something you'd be like,</v>

2751
02:17:13.751 --> 02:17:14.231
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

2752
02:17:14.231 --> 02:17:15.064
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I feel like it's a big </v>

2753
02:17:16.901 --> 02:17:17.734
<v Speaker 1>issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like he's older than you would </v>

2754
02:17:19.040 --> 02:17:21.280
<v Speaker 1>admit it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely been a thing,</v>

2755
02:17:21.281 --> 02:17:23.830
<v Speaker 1>so I feel like he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanT to say is 95.</v>

2756
02:17:23.831 --> 02:17:28.570
<v Speaker 1>Oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems like psychic.</v>

2757
02:17:28.600 --> 02:17:31.150
<v Speaker 1>That's what psychics do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>ThoSe fucks pitches.</v>

2758
02:17:31.180 --> 02:17:32.940
<v Speaker 1>Like I had a friend of mine and he went </v>
<v Speaker 1>to a psyche.</v>

2759
02:17:32.941 --> 02:17:35.260
<v Speaker 1>It's like dude's got a knew all aBout my</v>
<v Speaker 1>grandmother.</v>

2760
02:17:35.261 --> 02:17:36.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't you know about grandma?</v>

2761
02:17:37.300 --> 02:17:38.800
<v Speaker 1>You know about your grandma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>RIght?</v>

2762
02:17:38.950 --> 02:17:41.110
<v Speaker 1>So this guy knew some shit that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>already know.</v>

2763
02:17:41.290 --> 02:17:43.480
<v Speaker 1>Tell this guy to tell you some shit that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know.</v>

2764
02:17:43.910 --> 02:17:47.470
<v Speaker 1>You want someone to tell you thIngs you </v>
<v Speaker 1>already know that is fucking ridiculous.</v>

2765
02:17:47.500 --> 02:17:49.280
<v Speaker 1>You're going to set her off because </v>
<v Speaker 1>she's going,</v>

2766
02:17:49.780 --> 02:17:50.021
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2767
02:17:50.021 --> 02:17:50.741
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a bad way,</v>

2768
02:17:50.741 --> 02:17:51.220
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

2769
02:17:51.220 --> 02:17:54.040
<v Speaker 1>And I've only,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never experienced it first hand.</v>

2770
02:17:54.041 --> 02:17:58.330
<v Speaker 1>I've never had a psychic or someone with</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of energy.</v>

2771
02:17:58.331 --> 02:17:59.560
<v Speaker 1>Tell me something that I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

2772
02:17:59.561 --> 02:18:01.300
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck did you just like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

2773
02:18:01.301 --> 02:18:04.480
<v Speaker 1>There's people like you in my life who I</v>
<v Speaker 1>trust,</v>

2774
02:18:04.720 --> 02:18:05.553
<v Speaker 1>who have had experiences that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>unexplainable psychics tell me a family </v>

2775
02:18:12.341 --> 02:18:13.174
<v Speaker 1>secrets that I've bent over backwards to</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to understand how they could </v>

2776
02:18:15.881 --> 02:18:19.240
<v Speaker 1>possibly know what they knew and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>always skeptical.</v>

2777
02:18:19.690 --> 02:18:20.523
<v Speaker 1>That definitely had people that told me </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that there's fucking no way they </v>

2778
02:18:23.771 --> 02:18:25.120
<v Speaker 1>could know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the question though.</v>

2779
02:18:25.180 --> 02:18:28.150
<v Speaker 1>Did you give them any answers to other </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions before that?</v>

2780
02:18:28.900 --> 02:18:30.010
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None.</v>

2781
02:18:30.011 --> 02:18:30.844
<v Speaker 1>So they just told you right away your </v>
<v Speaker 1>uncle's gay and he has a boy that he </v>

2782
02:18:33.941 --> 02:18:35.350
<v Speaker 1>lives with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He pretends to son,</v>

2783
02:18:35.680 --> 02:18:36.730
<v Speaker 1>but it's really those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

2784
02:18:36.731 --> 02:18:38.740
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you serious?</v>

2785
02:18:38.741 --> 02:18:40.610
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>without hesiTation,</v>

2786
02:18:40.630 --> 02:18:42.880
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without that.</v>

2787
02:18:42.940 --> 02:18:43.773
<v Speaker 1>But something that ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>outrageous that they could only guess </v>

2788
02:18:46.720 --> 02:18:47.553
<v Speaker 1>and you didn't give him any answers to </v>
<v Speaker 1>any leading questions before that I </v>

2789
02:18:51.061 --> 02:18:53.410
<v Speaker 1>thought I heard on your podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe not,</v>

2790
02:18:53.411 --> 02:18:58.411
<v Speaker 1>but there is a documented history of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>military experimenting with.</v>

2791
02:18:59.040 --> 02:19:02.320
<v Speaker 1>So I mean if severe amending,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for years and years and years,</v>

2792
02:19:03.180 --> 02:19:06.360
<v Speaker 1>money if there's no actual question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2793
02:19:06.370 --> 02:19:07.203
<v Speaker 1>that's not necessarily true because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to find out if there was an </v>

2794
02:19:09.161 --> 02:19:11.170
<v Speaker 1>answer and the only way you find out is </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have,</v>

2795
02:19:11.200 --> 02:19:15.160
<v Speaker 1>you have to run some tests and they had </v>
<v Speaker 1>a thing called remote viewing.</v>

2796
02:19:15.640 --> 02:19:18.310
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we actually had some real remote viewing</v>

2797
02:19:18.311 --> 02:19:21.700
<v Speaker 1>experts on that tv show that I did for </v>
<v Speaker 1>awhile called the joe rogan questions.</v>

2798
02:19:21.701 --> 02:19:22.534
<v Speaker 1>Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We sat down with them and I had all </v>

2799
02:19:24.401 --> 02:19:27.990
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these remote viewing guys low</v>

2800
02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:31.340
<v Speaker 2>at the end of the dose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems a lot like psychics.</v>

2801
02:19:31.610 --> 02:19:33.620
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they,</v>

2802
02:19:33.670 --> 02:19:38.670
<v Speaker 2>they claim to have seen some things and </v>
<v Speaker 2>pointed out some things that helped some</v>

2803
02:19:39.291 --> 02:19:42.380
<v Speaker 2>operations and this and that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's all top secret.</v>

2804
02:19:42.381 --> 02:19:44.390
<v Speaker 2>Whether or not it's true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're never gonna know.</v>

2805
02:19:44.760 --> 02:19:45.593
<v Speaker 2>You're never goIng to know whether </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're bullshitting you or something </v>

2806
02:19:47.241 --> 02:19:50.300
<v Speaker 2>really did go down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've never seen anybody do it.</v>

2807
02:19:50.301 --> 02:19:51.134
<v Speaker 2>We had two guys try to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were supposedly extra sentence </v>

2808
02:19:52.900 --> 02:19:53.733
<v Speaker 2>they couldn't do shit</v>

2809
02:19:54.870 --> 02:19:59.100
<v Speaker 4>and I think there's a lot of people that</v>
<v Speaker 4>aren't authentic.</v>

2810
02:19:59.670 --> 02:20:03.570
<v Speaker 4>But that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of money in shenanigans.</v>

2811
02:20:03.810 --> 02:20:04.643
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of money in palm reading </v>
<v Speaker 4>that people that aren't going to charge </v>

2812
02:20:07.051 --> 02:20:07.884
<v Speaker 4>you the money are probably the people </v>
<v Speaker 4>that are actually doing something that </v>

2813
02:20:11.190 --> 02:20:11.610
<v Speaker 4>is meeting</v>

2814
02:20:11.610 --> 02:20:12.443
<v Speaker 2>for maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or It might be like a Stephen King book </v>

2815
02:20:13.901 --> 02:20:14.734
<v Speaker 2>were you driving down the street and see</v>
<v Speaker 2>that neon light and it says fortune </v>

2816
02:20:16.451 --> 02:20:17.284
<v Speaker 2>teller and you'd go in and it's some </v>
<v Speaker 2>lady who sees through your soul and she </v>

2817
02:20:19.481 --> 02:20:20.314
<v Speaker 2>does and she really does know things and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just like this is how she gets by </v>

2818
02:20:23.471 --> 02:20:26.320
<v Speaker 2>with this magic gift.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just pay 20 bucks a pop and she just</v>

2819
02:20:26.321 --> 02:20:28.660
<v Speaker 2>tells you crazy shit and you do what you</v>
<v Speaker 2>do with that.</v>

2820
02:20:28.870 --> 02:20:31.080
<v Speaker 2>But she knows and no one ever believes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She knows.</v>

2821
02:20:31.081 --> 02:20:34.330
<v Speaker 2>Cause it doesn't make any sense as </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking lady on ventura and victory like</v>

2822
02:20:35.010 --> 02:20:37.000
<v Speaker 2>fuck the more job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How does she know?</v>

2823
02:20:37.640 --> 02:20:40.570
<v Speaker 2>She know all this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she does.</v>

2824
02:20:40.660 --> 02:20:42.190
<v Speaker 2>Ventura doesn't intersect with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>victory.</v>

2825
02:20:42.450 --> 02:20:45.180
<v Speaker 4>Oh wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's the catch.</v>

2826
02:20:47.230 --> 02:20:50.160
<v Speaker 2>So when you're in the police office </v>
<v Speaker 2>telling them,</v>

2827
02:20:50.170 --> 02:20:51.940
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you the police was there.</v>

2828
02:20:51.970 --> 02:20:54.160
<v Speaker 2>It was real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was a real person.</v>

2829
02:20:54.161 --> 02:20:54.994
<v Speaker 2>I remembered the wilson's had been </v>
<v Speaker 2>living on ventura and victory for 37 </v>

2830
02:20:58.631 --> 02:21:01.350
<v Speaker 2>years and they've never moved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get back to the house.</v>

2831
02:21:01.360 --> 02:21:02.193
<v Speaker 2>It's the house</v>

2832
02:21:03.060 --> 02:21:04.110
<v Speaker 4>where.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where did,</v>

2833
02:21:04.650 --> 02:21:05.483
<v Speaker 4>where did the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where did fortune teller or you make it </v>

2834
02:21:08.201 --> 02:21:10.710
<v Speaker 4>fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I know I want to believe you right?</v>

2835
02:21:10.711 --> 02:21:12.480
<v Speaker 4>Because we're going to talk about this </v>
<v Speaker 4>at the barbecue.</v>

2836
02:21:13.050 --> 02:21:13.883
<v Speaker 4>My buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you really believe you believe in </v>

2837
02:21:16.381 --> 02:21:17.270
<v Speaker 4>psychics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>

2838
02:21:17.280 --> 02:21:18.113
<v Speaker 4>I've had too many things that I can't </v>
<v Speaker 4>explain that I am always going to </v>

2839
02:21:21.091 --> 02:21:22.820
<v Speaker 4>question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I have you.</v>

2840
02:21:22.850 --> 02:21:25.470
<v Speaker 4>Has anybody ever told you something was </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to happen then it happened?</v>

2841
02:21:25.620 --> 02:21:28.410
<v Speaker 4>I don't like that shit and I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't subscribe to that.</v>

2842
02:21:28.411 --> 02:21:29.244
<v Speaker 4>So if you shut your mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't subscribe to that because I </v>

2843
02:21:32.101 --> 02:21:34.050
<v Speaker 4>don't want someone to tell me my future.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

2844
02:21:34.051 --> 02:21:35.880
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's unfair and I think that's</v>

2845
02:21:36.180 --> 02:21:37.013
<v Speaker 4>disrespectful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I Think that weird word to use the </v>

2846
02:21:39.361 --> 02:21:44.361
<v Speaker 4>experiences I've had with these people </v>
<v Speaker 4>were with people that have died that uh,</v>

2847
02:21:45.550 --> 02:21:46.383
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've communicated with whether through </v>

2848
02:21:50.791 --> 02:21:51.624
<v Speaker 4>dreams or psychedelics and I had </v>
<v Speaker 4>questions but I didn't ask them and I </v>

2849
02:21:55.261 --> 02:21:56.094
<v Speaker 4>waited to see if they would tell me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's just kind of that sort of </v>

2850
02:22:00.460 --> 02:22:01.000
<v Speaker 4>setup.</v>

2851
02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:01.833
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thIng,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might be real and it might be that </v>

2852
02:22:04.930 --> 02:22:06.670
<v Speaker 2>real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What real is,</v>

2853
02:22:06.700 --> 02:22:10.960
<v Speaker 2>is so ridiculous that it's almost like </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't bottle it,</v>

2854
02:22:10.961 --> 02:22:11.794
<v Speaker 2>you can't measure it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't put it on the scale and it </v>

2855
02:22:13.181 --> 02:22:16.090
<v Speaker 2>only exists in these brief moments and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it comes and it goes.</v>

2856
02:22:16.091 --> 02:22:16.924
<v Speaker 2>You'll never be able to prove it and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>just comes and it goes and it makes you </v>

2857
02:22:18.971 --> 02:22:19.661
<v Speaker 2>think like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>god,</v>

2858
02:22:19.661 --> 02:22:20.494
<v Speaker 2>I think I really believe that really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really did happen and no one really </v>

2859
02:22:23.441 --> 02:22:24.820
<v Speaker 2>knows and everybody just goes about </v>
<v Speaker 2>their.</v>

2860
02:22:25.560 --> 02:22:26.010
<v Speaker 2>But it really</v>

2861
02:22:26.010 --> 02:22:27.930
<v Speaker 4>did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>he really did tap in.</v>

2862
02:22:28.170 --> 02:22:30.060
<v Speaker 4>He really did talk to someone who's not </v>
<v Speaker 4>there anymore.</v>

2863
02:22:31.040 --> 02:22:33.880
<v Speaker 4>I think whether you did or didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2864
02:22:34.590 --> 02:22:35.423
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is up to your acceptance of the </v>

2865
02:22:39.571 --> 02:22:40.404
<v Speaker 4>experience and whether it's your ego or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something you can't explain and if it </v>

2866
02:22:44.071 --> 02:22:46.620
<v Speaker 4>brings you comfort,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's great for sure.</v>

2867
02:22:46.621 --> 02:22:47.640
<v Speaker 4>if it brings you comfort,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2868
02:22:47.641 --> 02:22:49.710
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's the same argument for </v>
<v Speaker 4>religion.</v>

2869
02:22:49.870 --> 02:22:51.690
<v Speaker 4>YOu know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when people say the religions bullshit,</v>

2870
02:22:51.691 --> 02:22:52.524
<v Speaker 4>you go mom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's bullshit that makes people </v>

2871
02:22:54.361 --> 02:22:55.194
<v Speaker 4>happy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If it makes people happy then it's not </v>

2872
02:22:56.311 --> 02:22:57.144
<v Speaker 4>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's bullshit that makes people happy </v>

2873
02:22:58.711 --> 02:23:01.140
<v Speaker 4>and also controls people and does really</v>
<v Speaker 4>terrible things.</v>

2874
02:23:01.170 --> 02:23:04.140
<v Speaker 4>So it's also have to do all those </v>
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>

2875
02:23:04.141 --> 02:23:06.210
<v Speaker 4>But really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's a lot of,</v>

2876
02:23:07.930 --> 02:23:12.930
<v Speaker 4>it's very multifaceted subject sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but sugar sugar kills a lot of people,</v>

2877
02:23:13.621 --> 02:23:17.060
<v Speaker 4>but it also tastes delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you could just mention it,</v>

2878
02:23:17.070 --> 02:23:17.850
<v Speaker 4>like gets people.</v>

2879
02:23:17.850 --> 02:23:18.683
<v Speaker 4>But you know what's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I found out recently that a </v>

2880
02:23:20.700 --> 02:23:21.533
<v Speaker 4>scientology,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh religion is I'm the one of the main </v>

2881
02:23:27.061 --> 02:23:32.040
<v Speaker 4>backers for a narcotics anonymous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They are look it up,</v>

2882
02:23:32.670 --> 02:23:34.610
<v Speaker 4>I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tell me I'm wrong and going wrong.</v>

2883
02:23:34.680 --> 02:23:37.740
<v Speaker 4>Well they definitely don't like </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychiatric medicine and,</v>

2884
02:23:37.750 --> 02:23:38.583
<v Speaker 4>and so that's a really interesting </v>
<v Speaker 4>window into manipulation and tRying to </v>

2885
02:23:42.361 --> 02:23:46.560
<v Speaker 4>get people to subscribe to something and</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's the thing,</v>

2886
02:23:46.680 --> 02:23:48.650
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of fucking shit out there </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>

2887
02:23:48.651 --> 02:23:50.490
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what's right,</v>

2888
02:23:50.640 --> 02:23:51.473
<v Speaker 4>I can just speak to my own experiences </v>
<v Speaker 4>and things that I absolutely questioned </v>

2889
02:23:56.400 --> 02:23:59.630
<v Speaker 4>with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with so much thought and,</v>

2890
02:23:59.690 --> 02:24:03.770
<v Speaker 4>and continue to do so from things that </v>
<v Speaker 4>have happened years ago and I just,</v>

2891
02:24:04.060 --> 02:24:04.893
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't deny how I felt and what I've </v>

2892
02:24:06.991 --> 02:24:11.460
<v Speaker 4>experienced and I want to keep living </v>
<v Speaker 4>and understanding whatever it is,</v>

2893
02:24:12.180 --> 02:24:13.440
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>

2894
02:24:13.530 --> 02:24:15.930
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a reason why we're here or there</v>

2895
02:24:15.931 --> 02:24:18.360
<v Speaker 4>isn't and we're just here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I,</v>

2896
02:24:18.870 --> 02:24:19.703
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

2897
02:24:20.120 --> 02:24:20.940
<v Speaker 4>I'm not religious.</v>

2898
02:24:20.940 --> 02:24:21.773
<v Speaker 4>I feel a really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel inTerested in religion and some </v>

2899
02:24:26.461 --> 02:24:27.294
<v Speaker 4>of the things I've experienced over the </v>
<v Speaker 4>years being raised catholic and you're </v>

2900
02:24:31.860 --> 02:24:33.570
<v Speaker 4>kind of talking about a religious </v>
<v Speaker 4>experience.</v>

2901
02:24:33.600 --> 02:24:34.171
<v Speaker 4>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>

2902
02:24:34.171 --> 02:24:35.004
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do you think that everyone's going </v>

2903
02:24:37.141 --> 02:24:38.790
<v Speaker 4>to think of specific?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It had this argument.</v>

2904
02:24:38.791 --> 02:24:40.940
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't need is did we are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we are.</v>

2905
02:24:40.950 --> 02:24:42.870
<v Speaker 4>Because iT's not really a religion to </v>
<v Speaker 4>me,</v>

2906
02:24:42.871 --> 02:24:43.704
<v Speaker 4>it's not like some organized religion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm the spiritual energetic exchange of </v>

2907
02:24:50.671 --> 02:24:51.504
<v Speaker 4>information because I guess I equate </v>
<v Speaker 4>religion and this is where we can all </v>

2908
02:24:55.231 --> 02:24:58.230
<v Speaker 4>talk about this and like I am,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I don't know if I'm right,</v>

2909
02:24:58.280 --> 02:25:02.130
<v Speaker 4>I'm not like preaching,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but no one knows if you're wrong either,</v>

2910
02:25:02.190 --> 02:25:03.023
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but religion to me is like the </v>

2911
02:25:04.471 --> 02:25:05.304
<v Speaker 4>catholicism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was raised on that and that requires </v>

2912
02:25:08.120 --> 02:25:13.120
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>guilt and wrongfulness and sin and money</v>

2913
02:25:14.701 --> 02:25:18.060
<v Speaker 4>because you go to church and you put </v>
<v Speaker 4>your money in the basket every sunday.</v>

2914
02:25:18.480 --> 02:25:20.820
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

2915
02:25:21.590 --> 02:25:23.710
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen enough and I know enough about</v>

2916
02:25:23.740 --> 02:25:26.470
<v Speaker 4>pedophilia within the catholic church </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's undeniable.</v>

2917
02:25:26.471 --> 02:25:27.304
<v Speaker 4>You can't fucking deny any.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm talking about organization and </v>

2918
02:25:30.290 --> 02:25:32.360
<v Speaker 4>that's how I equate religion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

2919
02:25:33.130 --> 02:25:38.130
<v Speaker 4>But I think the different people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not the exact same that narcan and on.</v>

2920
02:25:39.640 --> 02:25:40.473
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Synonymous is so narcan is what the </v>

2921
02:25:43.221 --> 02:25:44.054
<v Speaker 2>scientology be people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an organization that promises </v>

2922
02:25:47.240 --> 02:25:49.520
<v Speaker 2>promotes rather than theories of </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientology.</v>

2923
02:25:49.521 --> 02:25:52.520
<v Speaker 2>Founder l ron hubbard regarding </v>
<v Speaker 2>substance abuse.</v>

2924
02:25:53.330 --> 02:25:56.190
<v Speaker 2>Same thing as narcotics or similar </v>
<v Speaker 2>groups.</v>

2925
02:25:56.470 --> 02:25:58.550
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate that in his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2926
02:25:58.551 --> 02:25:59.384
<v Speaker 2>all of l ron hubbard stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of it came from other psychology </v>

2927
02:26:03.670 --> 02:26:08.300
<v Speaker 2>textures and lectures rather than texts </v>
<v Speaker 2>and books and stuff.</v>

2928
02:26:08.530 --> 02:26:12.160
<v Speaker 4>If you read the rudimentary levels of of</v>
<v Speaker 4>l ron hubbard's teachings,</v>

2929
02:26:12.190 --> 02:26:13.023
<v Speaker 4>they're like amazing and then they start</v>
<v Speaker 4>getting weirder and weirder and you're </v>

2930
02:26:16.291 --> 02:26:17.051
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wait a minute,</v>

2931
02:26:17.051 --> 02:26:17.980
<v Speaker 4>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wait a minute.</v>

2932
02:26:18.400 --> 02:26:21.820
<v Speaker 4>It's really interesting and I think </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's even.</v>

2933
02:26:21.821 --> 02:26:23.950
<v Speaker 4>He didn't believe in psychics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

2934
02:26:25.470 --> 02:26:26.303
<v Speaker 4>What are you saying?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't really believe in psychics </v>

2935
02:26:29.711 --> 02:26:31.600
<v Speaker 4>either.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just believe in my experiences.</v>

2936
02:26:31.601 --> 02:26:33.730
<v Speaker 4>I think that there's a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a difference.</v>

2937
02:26:33.731 --> 02:26:34.564
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you should question everything </v>

2938
02:26:37.661 --> 02:26:40.600
<v Speaker 4>and then try to understand yourself the </v>
<v Speaker 4>best that you can.</v>

2939
02:26:40.790 --> 02:26:42.830
<v Speaker 2>I think that unique moments can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>unique.</v>

2940
02:26:43.040 --> 02:26:46.250
<v Speaker 2>I think there's this things have </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened When you think about someone on</v>

2941
02:26:46.251 --> 02:26:48.590
<v Speaker 2>the phone rings and they can tell you </v>
<v Speaker 2>all day long.</v>

2942
02:26:48.620 --> 02:26:50.300
<v Speaker 2>That's a coincidence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2943
02:26:50.301 --> 02:26:53.120
<v Speaker 2>How often do you think about them and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the phone doesn't ring.</v>

2944
02:26:53.480 --> 02:26:55.040
<v Speaker 2>The might be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might be right,</v>

2945
02:26:55.070 --> 02:26:57.920
<v Speaker 2>you might be right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there are some pretty unique moments</v>

2946
02:26:57.921 --> 02:27:00.680
<v Speaker 2>that I'm not exactly convinced our </v>
<v Speaker 2>measurable.</v>

2947
02:27:00.740 --> 02:27:02.660
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if they're measurable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2948
02:27:02.690 --> 02:27:04.670
<v Speaker 2>I think those unique moments where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>think about someone,</v>

2949
02:27:04.671 --> 02:27:06.140
<v Speaker 2>they text you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

2950
02:27:06.230 --> 02:27:09.890
<v Speaker 2>I don't necessarily think that there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>been adequate studies doing done on that</v>

2951
02:27:09.891 --> 02:27:10.724
<v Speaker 2>and I think there's a lot of people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>have these contrarion ideologies that </v>

2952
02:27:13.581 --> 02:27:18.110
<v Speaker 2>they really love to dismiss things like </v>
<v Speaker 2>this and they really love to dismiss the</v>

2953
02:27:18.111 --> 02:27:20.450
<v Speaker 2>potential connections that people have </v>
<v Speaker 2>between each other,</v>

2954
02:27:20.690 --> 02:27:23.180
<v Speaker 2>but we know we have connections when </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're near each other.</v>

2955
02:27:23.480 --> 02:27:24.313
<v Speaker 2>We know that like some people can just </v>
<v Speaker 2>look at you and you look at them and </v>

2956
02:27:26.840 --> 02:27:27.673
<v Speaker 2>let's get the fuck out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have like people have weird </v>

2957
02:27:31.251 --> 02:27:32.084
<v Speaker 2>connections with the other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You also know when someone's upset at </v>

2958
02:27:33.621 --> 02:27:35.210
<v Speaker 2>you and they're not being honest about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2959
02:27:35.211 --> 02:27:36.470
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's weird.</v>

2960
02:27:36.500 --> 02:27:37.333
<v Speaker 2>We have weird sort of ways of feeling </v>
<v Speaker 2>each other out that don't necessarily </v>

2961
02:27:41.121 --> 02:27:44.030
<v Speaker 2>fit on a scale but not quantifiable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're,</v>

2962
02:27:44.200 --> 02:27:45.033
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're.</v>

2963
02:27:45.410 --> 02:27:46.880
<v Speaker 2>You can't measure them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you feel them.</v>

2964
02:27:47.220 --> 02:27:48.053
<v Speaker 5>That's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was reading this article about that </v>

2965
02:27:49.690 --> 02:27:52.530
<v Speaker 5>kind of ties into music too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that just talking about,</v>

2966
02:27:53.200 --> 02:27:53.930
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2967
02:27:53.930 --> 02:27:57.870
<v Speaker 5>so you're talking about our ability to </v>
<v Speaker 5>read each other's facial expressions,</v>

2968
02:27:57.871 --> 02:28:00.660
<v Speaker 5>emotional expressions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's a successful trade,</v>

2969
02:28:00.920 --> 02:28:01.753
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's something that's part of the </v>

2970
02:28:02.580 --> 02:28:03.710
<v Speaker 5>development stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2971
02:28:04.080 --> 02:28:05.910
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and basically this,</v>

2972
02:28:05.911 --> 02:28:06.744
<v Speaker 5>I'm just getting into it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but this article is just talking about </v>

2973
02:28:08.131 --> 02:28:08.964
<v Speaker 5>how those,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just a lot of scientists trying to </v>

2974
02:28:11.251 --> 02:28:13.980
<v Speaker 5>understand are people like why the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 5>is music important?</v>

2975
02:28:13.981 --> 02:28:16.440
<v Speaker 5>Like this doesn't know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why is this such an obsession?</v>

2976
02:28:16.510 --> 02:28:21.510
<v Speaker 5>Human obsession just is a drug to that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it certainly is like even like</v>

2977
02:28:22.040 --> 02:28:22.873
<v Speaker 1>the other day I was watching rocky four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rocky ford came on just out of nowhere </v>

2978
02:28:25.281 --> 02:28:29.090
<v Speaker 1>else flipping to and songs that I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>even think are good anymore,</v>

2979
02:28:29.540 --> 02:28:30.373
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I recognize the drug like effect </v>

2980
02:28:32.300 --> 02:28:36.920
<v Speaker 1>that like one of those rocky songs will </v>
<v Speaker 1>survive a rocky songs.</v>

2981
02:28:37.310 --> 02:28:39.770
<v Speaker 1>But it's a combination of the movie and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the music.</v>

2982
02:28:39.771 --> 02:28:41.270
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just the music,</v>

2983
02:28:41.380 --> 02:28:43.490
<v Speaker 1>there's the visual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes not.</v>

2984
02:28:43.700 --> 02:28:45.890
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes just the music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2985
02:28:45.891 --> 02:28:50.891
<v Speaker 1>like when I run,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I run and if I listen to music,</v>

2986
02:28:51.201 --> 02:28:55.780
<v Speaker 1>I can go longer for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was that what the fuck's goIng on there?</v>

2987
02:28:56.080 --> 02:28:59.330
<v Speaker 1>How come you're not as tired when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to an emotional response?</v>

2988
02:29:00.050 --> 02:29:03.160
<v Speaker 1>You're inspired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're inspired by something that was,</v>

2989
02:29:03.920 --> 02:29:04.753
<v Speaker 1>that was taught to you at a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at a different time than the rhythm of </v>

2990
02:29:09.021 --> 02:29:12.140
<v Speaker 1>the music was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was ingrained in you.</v>

2991
02:29:12.141 --> 02:29:14.690
<v Speaker 1>At some point I can listen to motley </v>
<v Speaker 1>crue,</v>

2992
02:29:14.790 --> 02:29:17.150
<v Speaker 1>kickstart my heart and I can get up any </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking hell.</v>

2993
02:29:17.180 --> 02:29:19.490
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine if you take an </v>
<v Speaker 1>indigenous tribe in,</v>

2994
02:29:19.491 --> 02:29:21.230
<v Speaker 1>played like rock music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd be like,</v>

2995
02:29:21.231 --> 02:29:23.990
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had no idea what it was,</v>

2996
02:29:24.380 --> 02:29:28.660
<v Speaker 1>but maybe they wouldn't because there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's rhythm and there's a lot of um,</v>

2997
02:29:28.850 --> 02:29:29.683
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of musical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a tribal contributions to that area of </v>

2998
02:29:35.331 --> 02:29:39.710
<v Speaker 1>your life as a dancer.</v>

2999
02:29:43.310 --> 02:29:46.760
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not off the rails.</v>

3000
02:29:46.761 --> 02:29:47.570
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're good.</v>

3001
02:29:47.570 --> 02:29:52.570
<v Speaker 1>We're so good at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you're saying.</v>

3002
02:29:53.080 --> 02:29:56.090
<v Speaker 1>I feel like this is our best one yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we've said that before.</v>

3003
02:29:56.760 --> 02:29:59.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't done one in awhile.</v>

3004
02:29:59.760 --> 02:30:02.480
<v Speaker 1>It was over two years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two years.</v>

3005
02:30:02.900 --> 02:30:04.700
<v Speaker 1>Oh well shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

3009
02:30:12.500 --> 02:30:14.100
<v Speaker 1>We did a couple shows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are fun.</v>

<v Speaker 1>They were so much fun.</v>

<v Speaker 2>and then the life went on for five more </v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

3035
02:31:22.951 --> 02:31:24.780
<v Speaker 2>Like everything was going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

3036
02:31:24.781 --> 02:31:26.940
<v Speaker 2>thanks for bringing us on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was a lot of fun.</v>

3037
02:31:26.970 --> 02:31:28.830
<v Speaker 2>it was fun for us too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fun.</v>

3038
02:31:28.920 --> 02:31:31.950
<v Speaker 2>How did you get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how did you get the Alex Jones one to</v>

3039
02:31:31.951 --> 02:31:33.630
<v Speaker 2>be nine slash 11.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nine slash 11.</v>

3040
02:31:33.660 --> 02:31:37.920
<v Speaker 2>I had to plan it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do I had to fit some podcast in?</v>

3041
02:31:37.921 --> 02:31:38.754
<v Speaker 2>I had to do like extra ones the week </v>
<v Speaker 2>before just so I could get to number </v>

3042
02:31:41.461 --> 02:31:42.850
<v Speaker 2>nine slash 11 with alex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

3043
02:31:42.990 --> 02:31:43.823
<v Speaker 2>wasn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That sounds like a long seat of had him </v>

3044
02:31:46.460 --> 02:31:49.410
<v Speaker 2>on earlier and I would've definitely had</v>
<v Speaker 2>them on again for nine slash 11.</v>

3045
02:31:49.411 --> 02:31:51.510
<v Speaker 2>But having them on the first time for </v>
<v Speaker 2>nine slash 11,</v>

3046
02:31:51.630 --> 02:31:55.620
<v Speaker 2>and to this day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's our biggest podcast by far,</v>

3047
02:31:56.060 --> 02:31:59.610
<v Speaker 2>by maybe $5 million downloads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck yeah.</v>

3048
02:31:59.611 --> 02:32:00.890
<v Speaker 2>But here's the conspiracy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3049
02:32:00.930 --> 02:32:02.340
<v Speaker 2>Is that right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Am I saying correctly?</v>

3050
02:32:02.370 --> 02:32:03.480
<v Speaker 2>What is the actual number?</v>

3051
02:32:05.640 --> 02:32:06.473
<v Speaker 2>16 now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't check in the last two to three </v>

3052
02:32:07.531 --> 02:32:08.500
<v Speaker 2>days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but okay,</v>

3053
02:32:08.520 --> 02:32:10.950
<v Speaker 2>so $16,000,000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's what's crazy.</v>

3054
02:32:11.610 --> 02:32:12.443
<v Speaker 2>It never charted on itunes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The itunes charts magically went down </v>

3055
02:32:16.590 --> 02:32:17.423
<v Speaker 2>while the Alex Jones podcast was in </v>
<v Speaker 2>acute and they stayed down for over a </v>

3056
02:32:20.730 --> 02:32:23.490
<v Speaker 2>week conspiracy theory and then when it </v>
<v Speaker 2>came back up,</v>

3057
02:32:23.910 --> 02:32:27.270
<v Speaker 2>podcasts that got way less downloads </v>
<v Speaker 2>than alex's,</v>

3058
02:32:27.300 --> 02:32:29.580
<v Speaker 2>we're re were rated much higher than </v>
<v Speaker 2>his.</v>

3059
02:32:30.330 --> 02:32:31.163
<v Speaker 2>And theY had happened before and after </v>
<v Speaker 2>his was the only podcast that was left </v>

3060
02:32:36.091 --> 02:32:36.924
<v Speaker 2>out of the ratings loop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like for sure it would have been the </v>

3061
02:32:39.031 --> 02:32:39.864
<v Speaker 2>number one podcast in the country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the number one podcast we did by </v>

3062
02:32:41.761 --> 02:32:44.220
<v Speaker 2>a mile and I've had the number one </v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast before.</v>

3063
02:32:44.570 --> 02:32:45.403
<v Speaker 2>so the number one podcast episode that </v>
<v Speaker 2>was more than 5 million downloads more </v>

3064
02:32:49.441 --> 02:32:51.240
<v Speaker 2>than any other podcasts I had before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>

3065
02:32:51.440 --> 02:32:52.273
<v Speaker 2>So it's should for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably would have been number one if </v>

3066
02:32:53.671 --> 02:32:56.310
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't a lot of downloads,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless they had like one of those serial</v>

3067
02:32:56.311 --> 02:32:58.080
<v Speaker 2>episodes or something that came out that</v>
<v Speaker 2>week.</v>

3068
02:32:59.760 --> 02:33:02.080
<v Speaker 2>So there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's it.</v>

3069
02:33:02.100 --> 02:33:04.840
<v Speaker 2>It's very likely that someone's trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to hold Alex Jones back.</v>

3070
02:33:05.340 --> 02:33:07.970
<v Speaker 2>Stokes his fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't understand this,</v>

3071
02:33:07.971 --> 02:33:12.360
<v Speaker 2>the streisand effect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And stoke the fire of Alex Jones.</v>

3072
02:33:12.361 --> 02:33:13.470
<v Speaker 2>Even megan kelly's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>

3073
02:33:13.471 --> 02:33:16.920
<v Speaker 2>Now her show's going down the toilet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happened in the aftermath?</v>

3074
02:33:17.280 --> 02:33:18.330
<v Speaker 2>She.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the.</v>

3075
02:33:18.360 --> 02:33:19.970
<v Speaker 2>Here's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the problem.</v>

3076
02:33:20.010 --> 02:33:25.010
<v Speaker 2>Megan kelly was a fox news person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She left fox news to go to nbc.</v>

3077
02:33:25.200 --> 02:33:26.033
<v Speaker 2>Nbc is thought of as cnbc,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is thought of as fake news by </v>

3078
02:33:30.361 --> 02:33:33.810
<v Speaker 2>these right wing trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trump bands.</v>

3079
02:33:33.870 --> 02:33:36.240
<v Speaker 2>What would you call them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trump trumpers.</v>

3080
02:33:36.420 --> 02:33:39.390
<v Speaker 2>So as soon as she goes over there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to listen to her.</v>

3081
02:33:39.660 --> 02:33:43.650
<v Speaker 2>And then to the liberals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's fox news so they're not interested</v>

3082
02:33:43.651 --> 02:33:46.440
<v Speaker 2>in either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then she does this podcast with Alex</v>

3083
02:33:46.440 --> 02:33:49.230
<v Speaker 2>Jones or this interview rather with Alex</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jones and the interview with Alex Jones.</v>

3084
02:33:49.530 --> 02:33:50.363
<v Speaker 2>She says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to paint you out as a </v>

3085
02:33:52.411 --> 02:33:54.140

3086
02:33:54.180 --> 02:33:56.730
<v Speaker 2>like she's saying all these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's going to throw softballs this way.</v>

3087
02:33:56.731 --> 02:34:00.360
<v Speaker 2>I want people to get to know you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he releases all that and he's like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>this is that person,</v>

3089
02:34:01.321 --> 02:34:05.030

<v Speaker 2>gotta.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you gotta gotta go fox news full life.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3099
02:34:29.390 --> 02:34:30.223

<v Speaker 1>It's just kind of a natural thing for </v>

3100
02:34:33.131 --> 02:34:33.521
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>has got to be like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3103
02:34:38.080 --> 02:34:40.000
<v Speaker 1>I got to be somebody out there with no </v>
<v Speaker 1>leg hair.</v>

3104
02:34:41.230 --> 02:34:43.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called purity.</v>

3105
02:34:44.450 --> 02:34:45.670
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What it's called.</v>

3106
02:34:46.720 --> 02:34:47.553
<v Speaker 1>Sure has been brought it up one day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're all going to have no hair and </v>

3107
02:34:50.940 --> 02:34:52.650
<v Speaker 1>they're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look back at pictures of us going to go,</v>

3108
02:34:52.660 --> 02:34:54.700
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck were they doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>

3109
02:34:54.950 --> 02:34:57.340
<v Speaker 1>The human race,</v>
<v Speaker 1>facial hair and shit.</v>

3110
02:34:57.610 --> 02:35:02.610
<v Speaker 1>Everyone to know why brows and lashes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really think that's the future.</v>

3111
02:35:02.710 --> 02:35:04.960
<v Speaker 1>I think the future is those aliens for </v>
<v Speaker 1>close encounters.</v>

3112
02:35:04.960 --> 02:35:05.793
<v Speaker 1>I think the reason why we have those </v>
<v Speaker 1>archetypal images in our head that says </v>

3113
02:35:08.321 --> 02:35:12.580
<v Speaker 1>we know that's what we're going to talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>to paul hellyer or looked at his stuff.</v>

3114
02:35:13.240 --> 02:35:15.820
<v Speaker 1>He's like the canadian alien,</v>
<v Speaker 1>david.</v>

3115
02:35:16.400 --> 02:35:19.170
<v Speaker 1>They're all the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was.</v>

3116
02:35:19.180 --> 02:35:23.320
<v Speaker 1>He was part of the government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The government will have him for sure.</v>

3117
02:35:23.321 --> 02:35:24.154
<v Speaker 1>He's telling the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He specifically talks about the </v>

3118
02:35:26.440 --> 02:35:28.070
<v Speaker 1>different types of aliens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3119
02:35:28.071 --> 02:35:30.450
<v Speaker 1>well that makes them even more legit for</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

3120
02:35:30.460 --> 02:35:31.293
<v Speaker 1>With no evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He definitely would tell us all about </v>

3121
02:35:33.041 --> 02:35:33.874
<v Speaker 1>these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All different brands you might want to </v>

3122
02:35:35.441 --> 02:35:36.550
<v Speaker 1>have them on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>

3123
02:35:36.551 --> 02:35:38.610
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying there's no events.</v>

3124
02:35:39.400 --> 02:35:42.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't know him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know the whole alien alien.</v>

3125
02:35:42.970 --> 02:35:45.280
<v Speaker 1>You don't want people to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a business.</v>

3126
02:35:45.980 --> 02:35:46.813
<v Speaker 1>Values are who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Problem is there's a business and </v>

3127
02:35:49.931 --> 02:35:50.764
<v Speaker 1>telling people the candidates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aliens would give us some more tech if </v>

3128
02:35:55.091 --> 02:35:55.900
<v Speaker 1>we'd stop wars.</v>

3129
02:35:55.900 --> 02:35:56.800
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's play this.</v>

3130
02:35:56.980 --> 02:35:58.810
<v Speaker 1>I want to hear this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>

3131
02:35:59.530 --> 02:35:59.951
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

3132
02:35:59.951 --> 02:36:01.730
<v Speaker 1>but it's on our team,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but why is he the one?</v>

3133
02:36:02.220 --> 02:36:06.050
<v Speaker 1>He was on our t this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you talk to her,</v>

3134
02:36:06.060 --> 02:36:08.930
<v Speaker 1>but it says on our t proof of aliens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Presidents overwhelmed.</v>

3135
02:36:10.200 --> 02:36:14.020
<v Speaker 1>That's just a picture of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just a screenshot was on.</v>

3136
02:36:14.021 --> 02:36:15.180
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's got to be.</v>

3137
02:36:15.200 --> 02:36:16.270
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be a video of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3138
02:36:16.720 --> 02:36:17.553
<v Speaker 1>there's many videos of paul hellyer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you buy it when you listen to them </v>

3139
02:36:20.801 --> 02:36:23.110
<v Speaker 1>talk?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes me question to hear.</v>

3140
02:36:23.111 --> 02:36:23.944
<v Speaker 1>I'm interested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to hear his voice to see if my </v>

3141
02:36:25.391 --> 02:36:30.391
<v Speaker 1>crazy radar goes off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just give me a little on what you feel.</v>

3142
02:36:33.060 --> 02:36:34.390
<v Speaker 1>You got two different shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plan.</v>

3143
02:36:34.420 --> 02:36:35.410
<v Speaker 1>Jamie's a tabber.</v>

3144
02:36:36.880 --> 02:36:38.260
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>because I know that they are.</v>

3145
02:36:39.730 --> 02:36:40.563
<v Speaker 8>As a matter of fact,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they've been visiting our planet for </v>

3146
02:36:44.410 --> 02:36:45.243
<v Speaker 8>thousands of years and one of the cases </v>
<v Speaker 8>that would interest you most if they're </v>

3147
02:36:49.190 --> 02:36:53.230
<v Speaker 8>getting two or three minutes to answer </v>
<v Speaker 8>is during the cold war.</v>

3148
02:36:53.270 --> 02:36:54.103
<v Speaker 8>Nineteen 61 there were about 50 ufo </v>
<v Speaker 8>information flying south from Russia to </v>

3149
02:37:00.730 --> 02:37:05.730
<v Speaker 8>the across europe and the supreme allied</v>
<v Speaker 8>commander was very concerned,</v>

3150
02:37:07.190 --> 02:37:08.023
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and about ready to press the panic </v>

3151
02:37:09.911 --> 02:37:12.670
<v Speaker 8>button when they turned around and went </v>
<v Speaker 8>back over the north pole.</v>

3152
02:37:13.240 --> 02:37:14.073
<v Speaker 8>So they decided to do an investigation </v>
<v Speaker 8>and the investigators for three years </v>

3153
02:37:19.610 --> 02:37:24.610
<v Speaker 8>and they decided that with absolute </v>
<v Speaker 8>certainty that for species for different</v>

3154
02:37:26.181 --> 02:37:27.014
<v Speaker 8>species,</v>
<v Speaker 8>at least I've been visiting this planet </v>

3155
02:37:30.291 --> 02:37:33.570
<v Speaker 8>for thousands of years.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So that's a,</v>

3156
02:37:33.620 --> 02:37:34.453
<v Speaker 8>we have a long history of ufo is.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And of course there's been a lot more </v>

3157
02:37:37.341 --> 02:37:38.174
<v Speaker 8>activity on the last few decades since </v>
<v Speaker 8>we invented the atomic bomb and they're </v>

3158
02:37:45.320 --> 02:37:46.720
<v Speaker 8>very concerned about,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

3159
02:37:46.721 --> 02:37:48.540
<v Speaker 8>about that and the fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

3160
02:37:49.090 --> 02:37:49.923
<v Speaker 8>we might use it again and because the </v>
<v Speaker 8>whole cosmos is a unity and it affects </v>

3161
02:37:54.711 --> 02:37:57.290
<v Speaker 8>not just us,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but other people in the cosmos,</v>

3162
02:37:57.680 --> 02:37:58.513
<v Speaker 8>there are very much afraid that we might</v>
<v Speaker 8>be stupid enough to start using atomic </v>

3163
02:38:02.751 --> 02:38:03.530
<v Speaker 8>weapons again.</v>

3164
02:38:03.530 --> 02:38:06.410
<v Speaker 8>And this would be very bad for us and </v>
<v Speaker 8>for them as well.</v>

3165
02:38:06.740 --> 02:38:07.573
<v Speaker 9>So no serious scientists has ever </v>
<v Speaker 9>publicly confirmed evidence of an </v>

3166
02:38:10.971 --> 02:38:11.804
<v Speaker 9>encounter with extraterrestrials.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Why would scientists not confirm the </v>

3167
02:38:15.141 --> 02:38:16.640
<v Speaker 9>facts if they exist?</v>

3168
02:38:17.300 --> 02:38:18.133
<v Speaker 8>I'm afraid they must go out of their way</v>
<v Speaker 8>to not to find out because if they </v>

3169
02:38:21.751 --> 02:38:22.760
<v Speaker 8>didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

3170
02:38:22.800 --> 02:38:23.633
<v Speaker 8>even 10 percent of the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 8>research I've done in the last eight </v>

3171
02:38:25.801 --> 02:38:28.380
<v Speaker 8>years,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they would be as convinced as I am.</v>

3172
02:38:28.830 --> 02:38:30.570
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they could do it even faster,</v>

3173
02:38:30.890 --> 02:38:33.330
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>by taking them a little longer when they</v>

3174
02:38:33.331 --> 02:38:35.850
<v Speaker 8>didn't have a military background.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But,</v>

3175
02:38:35.851 --> 02:38:36.684
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there are so many wonderful books that </v>

3176
02:38:38.630 --> 02:38:43.110
<v Speaker 8>tell these stories and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and they've been authenticated.</v>

3177
02:38:43.150 --> 02:38:48.030
<v Speaker 8>The sightings have been authenticated by</v>
<v Speaker 8>more than one witness and also by.</v>

3178
02:38:48.031 --> 02:38:48.450
<v Speaker 8>Right?</v>

3179
02:38:48.450 --> 02:38:49.283
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the same horseshit debit </v>

3180
02:38:50.941 --> 02:38:52.670
<v Speaker 2>authenticated by witnesses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

3181
02:38:52.680 --> 02:38:54.750
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't mean anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no real video.</v>

3182
02:38:54.751 --> 02:38:57.000
<v Speaker 2>There's no real photographs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing looks good.</v>

3183
02:38:57.510 --> 02:38:58.343
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people were talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you think about how many human </v>

3184
02:39:00.781 --> 02:39:04.890
<v Speaker 2>beings there are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's 320 million plus in America.</v>

3185
02:39:05.100 --> 02:39:07.530
<v Speaker 2>How many of them are crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>At least one percent.</v>

3186
02:39:07.531 --> 02:39:09.090
<v Speaker 2>That's 3 million,</v>
<v Speaker 2>200,000</v>

3187
02:39:09.091 --> 02:39:12.510
<v Speaker 2>crazy people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many of them are really believe what</v>

3188
02:39:12.511 --> 02:39:14.130
<v Speaker 2>they're saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>At least half.</v>

3189
02:39:14.400 --> 02:39:18.630
<v Speaker 2>So you got 100.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got a lot of fucking crazy people.</v>

3190
02:39:18.690 --> 02:39:21.870
<v Speaker 2>Well this is one video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I've watched a couple of his and it's</v>

3191
02:39:21.871 --> 02:39:23.820
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting to think about in terms</v>

3192
02:39:23.821 --> 02:39:26.610
<v Speaker 2>of like we're here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting to think about,</v>

3193
02:39:26.611 --> 02:39:28.320
<v Speaker 2>but as soon as someone starts talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>

3194
02:39:28.620 --> 02:39:31.500
<v Speaker 2>he says they've been authenticated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was more than one witness.</v>

3195
02:39:31.680 --> 02:39:33.810
<v Speaker 2>That means nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are full of shit.</v>

3196
02:39:33.811 --> 02:39:34.644
<v Speaker 2>you just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw something doesn't mean anything </v>

3197
02:39:35.881 --> 02:39:36.714
<v Speaker 2>you might've you might not have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if he's 100 percent all in and he </v>

3198
02:39:39.391 --> 02:39:42.060
<v Speaker 2>hasn't had a ufo experience himself that</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's talking about,</v>

3199
02:39:42.790 --> 02:39:46.500
<v Speaker 2>then he seems gullible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talked to a lot of those people.</v>

3200
02:39:46.800 --> 02:39:47.633
<v Speaker 2>I talked to those people that had been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talked to people that have had </v>

3201
02:39:49.470 --> 02:39:53.160
<v Speaker 2>implants pulled out of their body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talked to people that were experts.</v>

3202
02:39:53.750 --> 02:39:54.583
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's gone.</v>

3203
02:39:54.780 --> 02:39:55.680
<v Speaker 2>What does it say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've seen one?</v>

3204
02:39:55.980 --> 02:39:56.813
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well it's something that gives me a </v>

3205
02:40:00.860 --> 02:40:03.270
<v Speaker 2>light.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mine haven't seen one,</v>

3206
02:40:03.271 --> 02:40:04.104
<v Speaker 2>but I'm curious to know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what he just said there did not </v>

3207
02:40:06.091 --> 02:40:06.924
<v Speaker 2>impress me because he said that multiple</v>
<v Speaker 2>people had seen it like more than one </v>

3208
02:40:10.471 --> 02:40:14.010
<v Speaker 2>person had confirmed it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't mean like</v>

3209
02:40:14.010 --> 02:40:14.843
<v Speaker 1>you could have five guys that ally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean they might tell the </v>

3210
02:40:16.831 --> 02:40:17.730
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

3211
02:40:17.880 --> 02:40:21.890
<v Speaker 1>italians call my people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do the ooh folks.</v>

3212
02:40:22.380 --> 02:40:23.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never heard that.</v>

3213
02:40:23.930 --> 02:40:25.050
<v Speaker 1>Is it two?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3214
02:40:26.070 --> 02:40:31.070
<v Speaker 1>two in a row do Harry Potter was a fail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I came back around.</v>

3215
02:40:32.820 --> 02:40:37.820
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not to dismiss,</v>

3216
02:40:40.580 --> 02:40:41.413
<v Speaker 1>dismiss the possibility of ufo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just that you gotta really be </v>

3217
02:40:43.801 --> 02:40:45.720
<v Speaker 1>careful with how people talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

3218
02:40:46.790 --> 02:40:48.450
<v Speaker 1>You got to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3219
02:40:48.451 --> 02:40:51.400
<v Speaker 1>if someone starts talking that they know</v>
<v Speaker 1>something and that's.</v>

3220
02:40:51.700 --> 02:40:52.533
<v Speaker 1>That's one video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've Watched a few of his videos and </v>

3221
02:40:54.421 --> 02:40:56.040
<v Speaker 1>they were really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>

3222
02:40:56.041 --> 02:41:00.440
<v Speaker 1>he was speaking with for canadian </v>
<v Speaker 1>congress talking about this and I,</v>

3223
02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:04.850
<v Speaker 1>I've watched a lot of it in its entirety</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's just worth thinking about.</v>

3224
02:41:04.860 --> 02:41:06.390
<v Speaker 1>That's all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the truth is.</v>

3225
02:41:06.391 --> 02:41:07.760
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3226
02:41:08.130 --> 02:41:08.761
<v Speaker 1>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please.</v>

3227
02:41:08.761 --> 02:41:09.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>always.</v>

3228
02:41:09.300 --> 02:41:11.100
<v Speaker 1>Just the fact that he has a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>videos out there,</v>

3229
02:41:11.101 --> 02:41:11.934
<v Speaker 1>it makes me wonder because that means </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he's making a living doing this or </v>

3230
02:41:14.851 --> 02:41:16.530
<v Speaker 1>this is this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a gig.</v>

3231
02:41:16.710 --> 02:41:21.490
<v Speaker 1>This is a thing he does your speaking </v>
<v Speaker 1>before the canadian congress chorus,</v>

3232
02:41:21.540 --> 02:41:22.373
<v Speaker 1>if he does a bunch of these other </v>
<v Speaker 1>interviews as well that allows them to </v>

3233
02:41:24.301 --> 02:41:25.590
<v Speaker 1>speak in front of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's his thing.</v>

3234
02:41:25.950 --> 02:41:28.050
<v Speaker 1>His thing is I'm the guy who knows </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything about ufo.</v>

3235
02:41:28.130 --> 02:41:30.840
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you were talking to scientists,</v>

3236
02:41:31.200 --> 02:41:33.060
<v Speaker 1>they would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>show us the residence.</v>

3237
02:41:33.150 --> 02:41:34.710
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing.</v>

3238
02:41:35.250 --> 02:41:38.250
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing about these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all have stories and no one has any</v>

3239
02:41:38.251 --> 02:41:42.000
<v Speaker 1>evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean feel evidence,</v>

3240
02:41:42.001 --> 02:41:43.680
<v Speaker 1>but it feels good to think that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>out there.</v>

3241
02:41:43.681 --> 02:41:45.360
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to know.</v>

3242
02:41:45.361 --> 02:41:48.030
<v Speaker 1>I want to know stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean like look at all the shit that we</v>

3243
02:41:48.031 --> 02:41:51.360
<v Speaker 1>have and we're here and all the things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we have,</v>

3244
02:41:51.710 --> 02:41:56.710
<v Speaker 1>all the resources that we use and we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>one planet in the universe full of other</v>

3245
02:41:59.911 --> 02:42:00.744
<v Speaker 1>plants.</v>

3246
02:42:01.100 --> 02:42:03.000
<v Speaker 1>That's all it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Way up there.</v>

3247
02:42:03.360 --> 02:42:04.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm not afraid to say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm.</v>

3248
02:42:04.560 --> 02:42:05.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm curious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm curious.</v>

3249
02:42:06.600 --> 02:42:10.230
<v Speaker 1>I think people generally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it feels like a normal thing to be like,</v>

3250
02:42:10.231 --> 02:42:11.250
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're fucking out there,</v>

3251
02:42:11.520 --> 02:42:14.130
<v Speaker 1>but what I think is hard to accept this </v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence.</v>

3252
02:42:14.180 --> 02:42:15.013
<v Speaker 1>What's hard to accept is that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicating with us and only certain </v>

3253
02:42:17.731 --> 02:42:19.570
<v Speaker 1>people like paul hellyer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3254
02:42:19.830 --> 02:42:22.350
<v Speaker 1>maybe he does know and maybe he has seen</v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

3255
02:42:22.351 --> 02:42:23.184
<v Speaker 1>but maybe he's full of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is if you haven't seen it </v>

3256
02:42:25.771 --> 02:42:26.604
<v Speaker 1>and I haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least I don't think I have and </v>

3257
02:42:28.600 --> 02:42:30.180
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about these things,</v>

3258
02:42:30.440 --> 02:42:31.273
<v Speaker 1>how much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much time you spend thinking and </v>

3259
02:42:32.371 --> 02:42:33.204
<v Speaker 1>talking about them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it gets to become almost like a </v>

3260
02:42:35.221 --> 02:42:36.054
<v Speaker 1>pathology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like why are you so invested in </v>

3261
02:42:37.261 --> 02:42:38.670
<v Speaker 1>something that you don't even know his </v>
<v Speaker 1>real,</v>

3262
02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:40.890
<v Speaker 1>but it becomes a thing that people were </v>
<v Speaker 1>into,</v>

3263
02:42:40.891 --> 02:42:43.950
<v Speaker 1>like they're into baseball scores or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>random bowling.</v>

3264
02:42:44.160 --> 02:42:46.860
<v Speaker 1>They get into ufo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get into it and then they start.</v>

3265
02:42:46.980 --> 02:42:49.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean this dude's obviously making a </v>
<v Speaker 1>career out of it.</v>

3266
02:42:49.380 --> 02:42:52.140
<v Speaker 1>He's out there traveling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's something to,</v>

3267
02:42:52.200 --> 02:42:57.150
<v Speaker 1>to investigate upon this conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it makes me think for years,</v>

3268
02:42:57.151 --> 02:42:59.580
<v Speaker 1>like I've seen some videos and I'm just </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3269
02:42:59.581 --> 02:43:00.500
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

3270
02:43:00.850 --> 02:43:01.683
<v Speaker 1>It makes me think that's all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I will always be curious about </v>

3271
02:43:05.010 --> 02:43:05.843
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>About aliens and psychics and all the </v>

3272
02:43:07.331 --> 02:43:08.164
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so controversial way where it's </v>

3273
02:43:10.561 --> 02:43:12.460
<v Speaker 1>like yes or no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't know,</v>

3274
02:43:12.461 --> 02:43:15.190
<v Speaker 1>but I want to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd love to keep learning I to,</v>

3275
02:43:15.520 --> 02:43:16.353
<v Speaker 1>but I think that with guys like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're talking about a subject </v>

3276
02:43:18.431 --> 02:43:22.390
<v Speaker 1>that's this mercurial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this such a difficult subject?</v>

3277
02:43:22.391 --> 02:43:25.000
<v Speaker 1>I think it's very impOrtant to only talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the actual facts,</v>

3278
02:43:25.250 --> 02:43:26.083
<v Speaker 1>like what we know or what we Don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he wants to talk about his own </v>

3279
02:43:27.971 --> 02:43:30.010
<v Speaker 1>personal experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one thing,</v>

3280
02:43:30.011 --> 02:43:30.844
<v Speaker 1>but when you start talking about stories</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you heard like people are full of </v>

3281
02:43:34.181 --> 02:43:35.014
<v Speaker 1>shit from the beginning of time when </v>
<v Speaker 1>telling stupid stories about werewolves </v>

3282
02:43:37.931 --> 02:43:40.690
<v Speaker 1>and vampires and of damages done to.</v>

3283
02:43:40.690 --> 02:43:44.320
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's all derivative passed </v>
<v Speaker 1>down like,</v>

3284
02:43:44.321 --> 02:43:45.154
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard this from this and this and </v>

3285
02:43:45.701 --> 02:43:47.180
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you weren't there so you don't know.</v>

3286
02:43:47.780 --> 02:43:52.780
<v Speaker 1>It's like I'm reading this book about </v>
<v Speaker 1>our brains and how our recollection of a</v>

3287
02:43:53.141 --> 02:43:56.230
<v Speaker 1>memory of memories and like eye </v>
<v Speaker 1>witnesses are usually inaccurate,</v>

3288
02:43:56.350 --> 02:43:57.183
<v Speaker 1>inaccurate because you don't really </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember like you think you did in your </v>

3289
02:43:59.951 --> 02:44:04.951
<v Speaker 1>brain lies to you and tells you that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>saw something a certain way and,</v>

3290
02:44:05.921 --> 02:44:07.910
<v Speaker 1>and even that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

3291
02:44:08.140 --> 02:44:08.973
<v Speaker 1>it's very important for people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely a lot of people out there </v>

3292
02:44:12.251 --> 02:44:15.190
<v Speaker 1>that think their memories are super </v>
<v Speaker 1>accurate and this ties into being wrong.</v>

3293
02:44:15.400 --> 02:44:16.233
<v Speaker 1>This ties into being like I didn't see </v>
<v Speaker 1>it the way that I think I did and I </v>

3294
02:44:21.071 --> 02:44:23.300
<v Speaker 1>might've made a mistake and I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3295
02:44:23.660 --> 02:44:24.493
<v Speaker 1>that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's important too because I think a </v>

3296
02:44:27.911 --> 02:44:28.744
<v Speaker 1>lot of times when you have some big </v>
<v Speaker 1>statement about something that you </v>

3297
02:44:30.821 --> 02:44:31.654
<v Speaker 1>believe in or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or like if you want to get down to </v>

3298
02:44:34.631 --> 02:44:38.860
<v Speaker 1>having some sort of a trial of this or </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and you say,</v>

3299
02:44:38.861 --> 02:44:40.420

<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

3303
02:44:50.770 --> 02:44:55.770
<v Speaker 1>Frightening really is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is people that are trying to convince</v>

3304
02:44:57.821 --> 02:44:58.654
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's one of the reasons why </v>

3305
02:44:59.261 --> 02:45:00.094
<v Speaker 1>being a president so crazy because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're basically like trying to trick </v>

3306
02:45:02.111 --> 02:45:02.944
<v Speaker 1>people into liking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You try to be charismatic and that's </v>

3307

<v Speaker 1>what sells the most.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made a mistake.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That song is fucking great.</v>

3473
02:58:33.061 --> 02:58:38.061
<v Speaker 1>Like what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will on our last record was a snafu.</v>

3474
02:58:38.640 --> 02:58:39.473
<v Speaker 1>There was some kind of label politics a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit like it was a little more </v>

3475
02:58:44.461 --> 02:58:47.040
<v Speaker 1>rock and roll and it wasn't as americana</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it just,</v>

3476
02:58:47.100 --> 02:58:47.933
<v Speaker 1>it was our choice to keep it off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eventually it got turned around and </v>

3477
02:58:50.581 --> 02:58:53.130
<v Speaker 1>around and around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that is a song that we.</v>

3478
02:58:53.220 --> 02:58:54.053
<v Speaker 1>This was a couple years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we came out here to work with a great </v>

3479
02:58:55.591 --> 02:58:59.460
<v Speaker 1>dude and kiefer's chancy a cnco,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3480
02:58:59.790 --> 02:59:00.623
<v Speaker 1>and we just did a set and there was that</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a couple other songs that we did </v>

3481
02:59:03.030 --> 02:59:04.050
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that were ours.</v>

3482
02:59:04.051 --> 02:59:05.660
<v Speaker 1>We own this music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when things are,</v>

3483
02:59:05.690 --> 02:59:07.770
<v Speaker 1>we owned it and they didn't want to pay </v>
<v Speaker 1>for it,</v>

3484
02:59:07.960 --> 02:59:10.740
<v Speaker 1>they didn't want it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we were going to record,</v>

3485
02:59:10.741 --> 02:59:13.590
<v Speaker 1>they would have owned it and not have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we were like,</v>

3486
02:59:13.591 --> 02:59:14.424
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we put all this effort into this song </v>

3487
02:59:15.461 --> 02:59:18.840
<v Speaker 1>and we love this song,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was just that thing where like we</v>

3488
02:59:18.841 --> 02:59:21.990
<v Speaker 1>had to fight for it and it's a great </v>
<v Speaker 1>song and it's not going anywhere.</v>

3489
02:59:22.020 --> 02:59:22.860
<v Speaker 1>It'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll come,</v>

3490
02:59:22.861 --> 02:59:23.694
<v Speaker 1>it'll come out eventually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dirty people don't know about that song </v>

3491
02:59:27.841 --> 02:59:28.674
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

3494
02:59:35.270 --> 02:59:40.270

<v Speaker 1>So both those classes,</v>

3495
02:59:41.790 --> 02:59:45.200
<v Speaker 1>it never made it on anything else other </v>
<v Speaker 1>than that youtube videos at all.</v>

<v Speaker 1>it?</v>

3497
02:59:47.350 --> 02:59:48.510
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we put it out.</v>

3498
02:59:48.511 --> 02:59:49.344
<v Speaker 1>People downloaded it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We used it to raise money for this </v>

3499
02:59:51.990 --> 02:59:52.823
<v Speaker 1>vehicle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we never put it down on rates on </v>

<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't like trip any alarms or </v>

<v Speaker 1>we just didn't want to give it up.</v>

3519
03:00:44.371 --> 03:00:45.720
<v Speaker 1>We didn't want someone else to be like,</v>
