00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.530
<v Speaker 1>You know how you go from one person's </v>
<v Speaker 1>page?</v>

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.570
<v Speaker 1>brother had died and he had been </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering with.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Like people are just fucking dying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

28
00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.650
<v Speaker 3>The ones that get me the worst,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the ones that like,</v>

29
00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.490
<v Speaker 3>he just died in his sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

30
00:01:06.491 --> 00:01:07.480
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Patton,</v>

00:01:07.481 --> 00:01:08.680
<v Speaker 3>Oswalt's wife.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

32
00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:09.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did it ever come out?</v>

33
00:01:09.971 --> 00:01:12.960
<v Speaker 3>What happened to her or do not know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do not know.</v>

34
00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:13.660
<v Speaker 3>So sad.</v>

35
00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.690
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all,</v>

36
00:01:16.691 --> 00:01:17.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all will go.</v>

37
00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.180
<v Speaker 1>Allegedly Bert Kreischer doesn't believe</v>
<v Speaker 1>it for a car.</v>

38
00:01:22.181 --> 00:01:23.230
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we are.</v>

39
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.400
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean proofread on?</v>

40
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.120
<v Speaker 1>You want me to kill you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what do you want me to do?</v>

41
00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.850
<v Speaker 1>We haven't previewed die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know people,</v>

42
00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.800
<v Speaker 1>they're not around anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

43
00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.000
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they died.</v>

44
00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.330
<v Speaker 1>So my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as opposed to just pretend they're not </v>

45
00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.140
<v Speaker 1>just not in this space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're in another space and in that</v>

46
00:01:41.141 --> 00:01:44.220
<v Speaker 1>space I'm there too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they went through a portal or what?</v>

47
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.920
<v Speaker 3>We had them on a kill Tony a couple days</v>
<v Speaker 3>ago and he was on this like weird pill.</v>

48
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.350
<v Speaker 3>He took this weird pill and he says that</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

49
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.300
<v Speaker 3>he fucks with my blood pressure though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if I laugh too hard I'll just faint</v>

50
00:01:56.301 --> 00:02:01.301
<v Speaker 3>and pass out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's happened three times already so I </v>

51
00:02:01.301 --> 00:02:01.301
<v Speaker 3>might pass it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

52
00:02:01.301 --> 00:02:01.301
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going,</v>

53
00:02:01.301 --> 00:02:02.000
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't not be famous.</v>

54
00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.720
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your brain is shutting off.</v>

55
00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.610
<v Speaker 1>Your brain is like too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're done.</v>

56
00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.000
<v Speaker 1>Funk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

57
00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say that's what happened to Hillary</v>

58
00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.420
<v Speaker 1>Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that she blacked out.</v>

59
00:02:16.421 --> 00:02:21.421
<v Speaker 1>She fainted and hit her head in 2012.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's all these concerns that people </v>

60
00:02:21.461 --> 00:02:23.200
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they're there.</v>

61
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.330
<v Speaker 1>They're founded in any fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but apparently the.</v>

62
00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.210
<v Speaker 1>The real incident did happen that she </v>
<v Speaker 1>fell down.</v>

63
00:02:31.211 --> 00:02:36.211
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she blacked out and fell down and hit </v>

64
00:02:36.211 --> 00:02:36.970
<v Speaker 1>her head and had a clot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which can be pretty serious,</v>

65
00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.420
<v Speaker 1>but there's an of course because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

66
00:02:40.421 --> 00:02:45.421
<v Speaker 1>there's people that are making all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy videos speculating that she has </v>

67
00:02:45.421 --> 00:02:47.830
<v Speaker 1>brain damage and she's out of her mind </v>
<v Speaker 1>that she's like super unhealthy.</v>

68
00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's.</v>

69
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.030
<v Speaker 1>See they'd taken these compilations of </v>
<v Speaker 1>her,</v>

70
00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

71
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.200
<v Speaker 1>she's doing hundreds and hundreds and </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds and hundreds of fucking </v>

72
00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.860
<v Speaker 1>interviews like this where people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking to her and</v>

73
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.390
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

74
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.900
<v Speaker 4>it probably becomes mind numbing after </v>
<v Speaker 4>a.</v>

75
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.160
<v Speaker 4>It looks like she's having fun to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's laughing,</v>

76
00:03:06.161 --> 00:03:11.161
<v Speaker 4>she's bombed her head up and down and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're saying that she's acting </v>

77
00:03:11.161 --> 00:03:15.031
<v Speaker 4>bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think she's a person who's dealing </v>

78
00:03:15.031 --> 00:03:15.031
<v Speaker 4>with massive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>massive amounts of stress.</v>

79
00:03:15.031 --> 00:03:19.640
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not necessarily a big fan of what </v>

80
00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.631
<v Speaker 4>she represents other than I think it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>Kinda cool that there's going to be a </v>

81
00:03:21.631 --> 00:03:22.780
<v Speaker 4>first chick that's a president,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>

82
00:03:22.781 --> 00:03:25.930
<v Speaker 4>I think it was good to have a first </v>
<v Speaker 4>black president as much as A.</v>

83
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.670
<v Speaker 4>People didn't think that that was a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

84
00:03:28.671 --> 00:03:30.550
<v Speaker 4>like important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was important.</v>

85
00:03:30.551 --> 00:03:32.890
<v Speaker 4>Socially it's important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's important.</v>

86
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.530
<v Speaker 4>Like having a chick president would be </v>
<v Speaker 4>interesting.</v>

87
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.330
<v Speaker 4>It'd be interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd like to see where it goes.</v>

88
00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:42.280
<v Speaker 4>The problem with her is she represents </v>
<v Speaker 4>like the oldest form of government.</v>

89
00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.260
<v Speaker 4>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you remember that movie?</v>

90
00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.730
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what was the fucking movie where there </v>

91
00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.790
<v Speaker 4>were the elder vampires?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm talking about?</v>

92
00:03:51.791 --> 00:03:53.410
<v Speaker 4>Like there was the Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>blade,</v>

93
00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.930
<v Speaker 4>the movie blade,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right where they were the ones that were</v>

94
00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:04.170
<v Speaker 4>turned into vampires.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then there was the old ones who are </v>

95
00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.290
<v Speaker 4>born vampires.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There were natural born vampires.</v>

96
00:04:05.291 --> 00:04:10.291
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they didn't like blade because he </v>

97
00:04:10.291 --> 00:04:10.920
<v Speaker 4>was half human and he was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

98
00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:12.010
<v Speaker 4>he was made</v>

99
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:13.710
<v Speaker 5>day Walker.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He said,</v>

100
00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:18.850
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was a day walker because he was half </v>

101
00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:18.850
<v Speaker 5>human.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He could.</v>

102
00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.380
<v Speaker 5>He could hang around a daytime.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I still maintain that first fucking </v>

103
00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:22.110
<v Speaker 5>movie,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that first blade movies.</v>

104
00:04:22.111 --> 00:04:23.910
<v Speaker 5>One of my all time favorite comic book </v>
<v Speaker 5>movies.</v>

105
00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.470
<v Speaker 5>Have you ever watched it lately?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

106
00:04:25.471 --> 00:04:29.070
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Either breaks and everything's breaking.</v>

107
00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.360
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going.</v>

108
00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.720
<v Speaker 5>I'm not gonna Watch us and one of my all</v>
<v Speaker 5>time favorite comic book movies.</v>

109
00:04:33.721 --> 00:04:36.570
<v Speaker 5>I fucking loved that movie,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that was the thing.</v>

110
00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.810
<v Speaker 5>So Hillary Clinton's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's one of those born vampires.</v>

111
00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.840
<v Speaker 5>She murders murders a lot of people is </v>
<v Speaker 5>what you're saying?</v>

112
00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.330
<v Speaker 5>I'm not saying she merged a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>

113
00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.230
<v Speaker 5>I'm saying people that get into conflict</v>
<v Speaker 5>with her wind up dead as fuck,</v>

114
00:04:49.231 --> 00:04:49.700
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whatever.</v>

115
00:04:49.701 --> 00:04:50.610
<v Speaker 5>Are we what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jamie?</v>

116
00:04:50.611 --> 00:04:52.890
<v Speaker 5>What number are we on now?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's 49,</v>

117
00:04:52.891 --> 00:04:54.210
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think up to somewhere,</v>

118
00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.550
<v Speaker 5>as the Internet says it's up to 49,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but now</v>

119
00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:02.410
<v Speaker 4>coincidence or is this evidence like </v>
<v Speaker 4>when we look at an evidence or or is </v>

120
00:05:03.441 --> 00:05:08.441
<v Speaker 4>this just will look at what these people</v>
<v Speaker 4>are doing and the last guy seemed to be </v>

121
00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.750
<v Speaker 4>like a robbery attempt or something like</v>
<v Speaker 4>that because it was 4:00</v>

122
00:05:11.751 --> 00:05:16.751
<v Speaker 4>in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He got shot walking down the street and </v>

123
00:05:16.751 --> 00:05:18.410
<v Speaker 4>Washington like know Washington's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>notoriously dangerous place.</v>

124
00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:21.860
<v Speaker 4>Me and barrier got elected after he got </v>
<v Speaker 4>arrested,</v>

125
00:05:21.861 --> 00:05:24.980
<v Speaker 4>went to jail for crack.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He then he got elected again.</v>

126
00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.060
<v Speaker 5>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's true.</v>

127
00:05:28.061 --> 00:05:33.061
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's a beehive for crazy people </v>

128
00:05:33.061 --> 00:05:33.061
<v Speaker 5>because anyone that likes government.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>

129
00:05:33.061 --> 00:05:34.240
<v Speaker 5>the guy that climbed trump tower,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's a crazy person.</v>

130
00:05:34.241 --> 00:05:39.241
<v Speaker 5>Who,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you saw his interview he talking </v>

131
00:05:39.241 --> 00:05:39.241
<v Speaker 5>about yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't know.</v>

132
00:05:39.241 --> 00:05:40.930
<v Speaker 5>You didn't hear about this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

133
00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:43.030
<v Speaker 5>This was like the biggest thing for like</v>
<v Speaker 5>three hours.</v>

134
00:05:43.031 --> 00:05:46.000
<v Speaker 5>This guy was suction cups,</v>
<v Speaker 5>climbing the trump tower.</v>

135
00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:51.230
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like police busting windows out of </v>

136
00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.230
<v Speaker 5>trump's windows,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like trying to grab and get.</v>

137
00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:52.120
<v Speaker 5>Couldn't get him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He kept on climbing.</v>

138
00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:56.110
<v Speaker 5>He released the guy released a video </v>
<v Speaker 5>like 12 hours before Sam,</v>

139
00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.160
<v Speaker 5>and if you listen to the video,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it sounds like</v>

140
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.670
<v Speaker 3>a youtube commentor like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just like,</v>

141
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:05.950
<v Speaker 3>like I want to give a mess appearance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't know how many people will </v>

142
00:06:06.141 --> 00:06:09.980
<v Speaker 3>walk this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd rather not be recognizable.</v>

143
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:13.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm an independent researcher.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're good.</v>

144
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.330
<v Speaker 3>I've had my fill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was pretty intense because he got</v>

145
00:06:17.331 --> 00:06:22.331
<v Speaker 3>up pretty high and could for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't think the police were going to </v>

146
00:06:22.331 --> 00:06:23.440
<v Speaker 3>be able to do anything but watching them</v>
<v Speaker 3>work in their,</v>

147
00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:26.390
<v Speaker 3>their tactics to catch a guy that has </v>
<v Speaker 3>suction cups,</v>

148
00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:27.740
<v Speaker 3>cups.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very interesting.</v>

149
00:06:27.741 --> 00:06:31.790
<v Speaker 3>This is when they pull him in and he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he means stone.</v>

150
00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:35.830
<v Speaker 3>It's like right here at me and he's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he's still connected to the rope.</v>

151
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:38.630
<v Speaker 3>There's probably beating the fuck out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>here it is.</v>

152
00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:40.910
<v Speaker 3>Dick's getting together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to undo them.</v>

153
00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.640
<v Speaker 3>They're just going to cut it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

154
00:06:42.641 --> 00:06:46.880
<v Speaker 3>they ended up pulling it off somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they destroyed that,</v>

155
00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:47.750
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that building.</v>

156
00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:51.170
<v Speaker 3>They broke a lot of windows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cut a lot of like crates or uh,</v>

157
00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:54.410
<v Speaker 3>air conditioning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What a crazy fucker.</v>

158
00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:57.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It not what happens to a guy like that.</v>

159
00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:59.690
<v Speaker 3>How long you go to jail for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

160
00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.540
<v Speaker 3>I don't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think that's a.</v>

161
00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.700
<v Speaker 3>whilst the charges today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was going to look at that second.</v>

162
00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:08.960
<v Speaker 3>I think mental,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's gonna be in a mental hospital more </v>

163
00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.760
<v Speaker 3>so than a a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a jail it seems like,</v>

164
00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:15.890
<v Speaker 3>but these kind of people or the people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that hang out in like Washington DC and </v>

165
00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:19.361
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why DC or Washington so a so </v>

166
00:07:19.361 --> 00:07:19.361
<v Speaker 3>dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

167
00:07:19.361 --> 00:07:23.441
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's because they're attracted to this </v>

168
00:07:23.441 --> 00:07:23.441
<v Speaker 3>crazy thing that's already happening.</v>

169
00:07:23.441 --> 00:07:28.250
<v Speaker 1>A hive of government and everybody knows</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got to a centralized location </v>

170
00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:32.330
<v Speaker 1>because the hive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington DC's the hive of our </v>

171
00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:34.860
<v Speaker 1>government and the penthouse is a or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pentagon.</v>

172
00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:38.760
<v Speaker 1>Penthouse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Pentagon is not that far from there.</v>

173
00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:40.170
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How far is that?</v>

174
00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:42.390
<v Speaker 1>It's in Virginia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

175
00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:46.260
<v Speaker 1>How far by air is the Pentagon or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>White House?</v>

176
00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:48.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're fairly close to each other,</v>

177
00:07:48.001 --> 00:07:50.730
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably be like a 12 hour drive.</v>

178
00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:53.910
<v Speaker 1>Something like that I guess isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that whole area though.</v>

179
00:07:53.911 --> 00:07:57.030
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's also that giant community of</v>

180
00:07:57.031 --> 00:08:02.031
<v Speaker 1>lobbyists that lives in Virginia just </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside of Washington dc that,</v>

181
00:08:02.101 --> 00:08:07.101
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian Cowen was telling me some of the </v>

182
00:08:07.101 --> 00:08:07.110
<v Speaker 1>richest people per capita in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>

183
00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:11.740
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pc Cemetery.</v>

184
00:08:11.741 --> 00:08:14.230
<v Speaker 3>It's just across the river from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm pretty sure it was pretty close.</v>

185
00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:15.940
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was way off.</v>

186
00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:19.640
<v Speaker 3>I had no idea it was that close to all </v>
<v Speaker 3>of our driver.</v>

187
00:08:19.641 --> 00:08:22.270
<v Speaker 3>It's a 12 minute walk from the Pentagon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

188
00:08:22.271 --> 00:08:24.070
<v Speaker 3>it's just literally really across the </v>
<v Speaker 3>river.</v>

189
00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:24.680
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

190
00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:29.200
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was more like a half hour </v>
<v Speaker 1>away in bad traffic.</v>

191
00:08:29.201 --> 00:08:30.640
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's what it is.</v>

192
00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:35.790
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was like a over the river </v>
<v Speaker 1>and through the woods to grandmother's </v>

193
00:08:35.790 --> 00:08:35.860
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We go.</v>

194
00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:39.160
<v Speaker 1>It's close as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the point being that that's a,</v>

195
00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:42.490
<v Speaker 1>that's a hub.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that one last guy that got shot,</v>

196
00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:47.820
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody who get shot in Washington DC </v>

197
00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:47.820
<v Speaker 1>walking around the street at 4:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the morning and get shot,</v>

198
00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:50.050
<v Speaker 1>it can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can zig zagged.</v>

199
00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:52.570
<v Speaker 1>You could rock it to the wrong dude at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the wrong time.</v>

200
00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:56.250
<v Speaker 1>And it can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just part of living in a high crime</v>

201
00:08:56.251 --> 00:08:58.050
<v Speaker 1>area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so who knows if that one was,</v>

202
00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:03.200
<v Speaker 1>but there's a gang of them that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>connected to the Clintons that just </v>

203
00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:03.420
<v Speaker 1>wound them getting whacked.</v>

204
00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:06.430
<v Speaker 3>Did you see all the crime that's been </v>
<v Speaker 3>going on in the Olympics?</v>

205
00:09:06.431 --> 00:09:11.431
<v Speaker 3>Like I sent Jamie this video of in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Brazil and it's just a collection of </v>

206
00:09:11.431 --> 00:09:15.601
<v Speaker 3>like the first or second day of the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have like these people just </v>

207
00:09:15.601 --> 00:09:19.501
<v Speaker 3>watching the streets for crime and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>just tons of these petty theft like </v>

208
00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:24.720
<v Speaker 3>people getting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to just steal people's stuff and </v>

209
00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:28.441
<v Speaker 3>this video,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this came out I think the first </v>

210
00:09:28.441 --> 00:09:28.441
<v Speaker 3>or second day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this video is nonstop.</v>

211
00:09:28.441 --> 00:09:32.490
<v Speaker 3>It's just happening like people just </v>
<v Speaker 3>coming up and trying to steal people's </v>

212
00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:34.510
<v Speaker 3>cell phones and some guys are really </v>
<v Speaker 3>smart with it.</v>

213
00:09:34.511 --> 00:09:37.300
<v Speaker 3>They get on these bikes and you now when</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're looking at your cell phone,</v>

214
00:09:37.301 --> 00:09:40.960
<v Speaker 3>you're just kind of holding it barely </v>
<v Speaker 3>and people are just coming up and taking</v>

215
00:09:40.961 --> 00:09:43.030
<v Speaker 3>their phones on bikes and then taking </v>
<v Speaker 3>off and it's.</v>

216
00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:48.390

<v Speaker 3>This guy is the biggest pussy in the </v>

217
00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:48.390
<v Speaker 3>road by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right here.</v>

218
00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:50.800

<v Speaker 3>knows like guys following him,</v>

219
00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:56.010
<v Speaker 3>he's getting close to his girl and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>just not doing anything and then this </v>

220
00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:58.300
<v Speaker 3>kid ends up stealing something from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy in front of them.</v>

221
00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:00.550
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

224
00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:09.160
<v Speaker 3>Some people</v>

225
00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:14.560
<v Speaker 1>super disenfranchise and poor and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was something that Byron bowers who </v>

226
00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:17.910
<v Speaker 1>talked about in the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the difference between people that are </v>

227
00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:18.460
<v Speaker 1>just trying to survive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just trying to survive.</v>

228
00:10:18.461 --> 00:10:23.461
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a totally different world that </v>

229
00:10:23.461 --> 00:10:23.461
<v Speaker 1>grow and fight at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's just like,</v>

230
00:10:23.461 --> 00:10:23.461
<v Speaker 1>just give it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

231
00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:28.690
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so how many people have supposedly been </v>

232
00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:28.690
<v Speaker 1>whacked?</v>

233
00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:31.610
<v Speaker 3>What does the Internet believe?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was 49.</v>

234
00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:36.320
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to find the.</v>

235
00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:39.210
<v Speaker 1>But is there anybody that makes a </v>
<v Speaker 1>compelling case?</v>

236
00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:41.650
<v Speaker 1>It says 96.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

237
00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:46.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it depends on which website you </v>

238
00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:46.990
<v Speaker 1>want to look up and find who was </v>
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy.</v>

239
00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:50.070
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to dig down?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's on snoopy's or snopes?</v>

240
00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:55.160
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's what one of the weirdest things </v>

241
00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:56.871
<v Speaker 1>about government is that it affects all </v>
<v Speaker 1>of us right in this room,</v>

242
00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:02.330
<v Speaker 1>but we couldn't be further away from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>type of person that would want to run </v>

243
00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:04.410
<v Speaker 1>the government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't want to run shit.</v>

244
00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:06.420
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to run shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

245
00:11:06.421 --> 00:11:08.760
<v Speaker 1>like the type of people that do want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do that.</v>

246
00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:14.300
<v Speaker 1>They are so not like most people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people do not want to run </v>

247
00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:18.741
<v Speaker 1>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you get people that are in that </v>

248
00:11:18.741 --> 00:11:22.231
<v Speaker 1>like higher echelon of government and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have the ability literally to </v>

249
00:11:22.241 --> 00:11:27.241
<v Speaker 1>manipulate which way the country thinks </v>
<v Speaker 1>that without really persuasive,</v>

250
00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:34.110
<v Speaker 1>articulate speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they really have the opportunity to </v>

251
00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:35.920
<v Speaker 1>change the way the country feels about </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

252
00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:36.940
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

253
00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:40.330
<v Speaker 1>like Kennedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like his summer Kennedy's speeches.</v>

254
00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:45.640
<v Speaker 1>You would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would listen to them and you would </v>

255
00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:47.100
<v Speaker 1>want to be a better person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You hear that guy talk and he,</v>

256
00:11:47.101 --> 00:11:52.101
<v Speaker 1>he said such poetic shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was so brilliant and the way he was </v>

257
00:11:52.391 --> 00:11:54.010
<v Speaker 1>able to communicate and a</v>

258
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:59.010
<v Speaker 6>lot of blase,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like a lot of people thought Obama was </v>

259
00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:02.101
<v Speaker 6>going to be like that too because it </v>
<v Speaker 6>seemed like he kind of was when he was </v>

260
00:12:02.101 --> 00:12:03.310
<v Speaker 6>running for office and we seemed like </v>
<v Speaker 6>when this guy gets in,</v>

261
00:12:03.311 --> 00:12:04.840
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's going to make some of those Kennedy</v>

262
00:12:04.841 --> 00:12:08.440
<v Speaker 6>type speeches and he made some really </v>
<v Speaker 6>good speeches for sure,</v>

263
00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:11.230
<v Speaker 6>but it always felt like he was.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Everything was down the middle,</v>

264
00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:15.460
<v Speaker 6>like everything was like a 90 Sitcom,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

265
00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:17.950
<v Speaker 6>It's like there was not much chances </v>
<v Speaker 6>being taken.</v>

266
00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:22.270
<v Speaker 6>It was like you wanted Seinfeld and you </v>
<v Speaker 6>got mad about you.</v>

267
00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:23.770
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>

268
00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:28.420
<v Speaker 6>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not that there's anything wrong with mad</v>

269
00:12:28.421 --> 00:12:33.421
<v Speaker 6>about you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So fine program went along on a long </v>

270
00:12:33.421 --> 00:12:33.421
<v Speaker 6>time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A lot of people enjoyed it,</v>

271
00:12:33.421 --> 00:12:34.510
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it wasn't curb your enthusiasm.</v>

272
00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:35.260
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's,</v>

273
00:12:35.261 --> 00:12:36.160
<v Speaker 6>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's,</v>

274
00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:41.640
<v Speaker 6>when,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when a guy comes out like Obama and his </v>

275
00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:43.960
<v Speaker 6>speeches at the Democratic convention </v>
<v Speaker 6>before he was elected,</v>

276
00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:45.640
<v Speaker 6>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Holy Shit.</v>

277
00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:49.240
<v Speaker 6>Like this is going to be the guy who's </v>
<v Speaker 6>going to be this super articulate,</v>

278
00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:52.570
<v Speaker 6>powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 6>powerful guy who writes all the wrongs,</v>

279
00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:57.310
<v Speaker 6>so one of two options,</v>
<v Speaker 6>either one,</v>

280
00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:01.570
<v Speaker 6>he was never really liked that and it </v>
<v Speaker 6>was just tricking us and is brilliant.</v>

281
00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:07.230
<v Speaker 6>Like a portrayal of this rebel of this </v>
<v Speaker 6>person who's gonna come in and give you </v>

282
00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:15.300
<v Speaker 6>hope and change or two,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you get in there and the sobering effect</v>

283
00:13:15.371 --> 00:13:18.760
<v Speaker 6>of what you're presented with every day </v>
<v Speaker 6>makes you realize like,</v>

284
00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:23.790
<v Speaker 6>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're just running around putting out </v>

285
00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:25.831
<v Speaker 6>fires all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a fucking like what you're </v>

286
00:13:25.831 --> 00:13:28.981
<v Speaker 6>seeing from those kids in that video in </v>
<v Speaker 6>the Olympics where these people are </v>

287
00:13:29.891 --> 00:13:34.891
<v Speaker 6>getting a purse snatched and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Tourists are getting personality pick </v>

288
00:13:34.891 --> 00:13:38.600
<v Speaker 6>pocketed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That is just what happens when things </v>

289
00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:39.940
<v Speaker 6>are all fucked up and unbalanced.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what happens.</v>

290
00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:41.080
<v Speaker 6>It's just what happened.</v>

291
00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:44.550
<v Speaker 3>That's just a whole mess.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like do you think this is the end of the</v>

292
00:13:44.551 --> 00:13:48.300
<v Speaker 3>Olympics?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just based on like how much trouble this</v>

293
00:13:48.301 --> 00:13:50.910
<v Speaker 3>Olympics has been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

294
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.000
<v Speaker 3>looking at all the hotel rooms where the</v>
<v Speaker 3>sinks are falling through the counters </v>

295
00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.811
<v Speaker 3>and how the water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you saw the water today </v>

296
00:13:59.811 --> 00:14:02.151
<v Speaker 3>is green because they have an allergy </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem or something like that and if </v>

297
00:14:02.521 --> 00:14:05.820
<v Speaker 3>you look at all the past Olympics and </v>
<v Speaker 3>how all the structures,</v>

298
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.260
<v Speaker 3>there's a website where it shows like </v>
<v Speaker 3>all the Olympics and how it just,</v>

299
00:14:09.261 --> 00:14:14.261
<v Speaker 3>they have all these concrete things that</v>
<v Speaker 3>are just now overrun by a trees and </v>

300
00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:19.290
<v Speaker 3>weeds and stuff and how much it costs to</v>
<v Speaker 3>make all this and now it's just ruined </v>

301
00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:19.290
<v Speaker 3>land.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

302
00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:24.200
<v Speaker 3>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once you put concrete on land it's </v>

303
00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:26.331
<v Speaker 3>pretty much ruined you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really hard for it to ever be </v>

304
00:14:26.331 --> 00:14:27.900
<v Speaker 3>farmed on again or things to grow when </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's concrete on there.</v>

305
00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:33.110
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I guess it makes sense that you'd have </v>

306
00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:33.110
<v Speaker 6>to look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean this is just things apart.</v>

307
00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:34.850
<v Speaker 3>This is old and as 1984 Olympics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just try.</v>

308
00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:35.720
<v Speaker 3>It looks trashy.</v>

309
00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:37.550
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they were using for a bike course.</v>

310
00:14:37.551 --> 00:14:38.960
<v Speaker 6>So that's kind of done.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It looks fun.</v>

311
00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:40.670
<v Speaker 6>Where's that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Where's that?</v>

312
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:42.740
<v Speaker 6>Sarah Yandell.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Hers is hers.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It governing his or Grovedale is a </v>

316
00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:51.560
<v Speaker 6>scrolled up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So we see that,</v>

317
00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:54.230
<v Speaker 6>so we'll look at that man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that looks fun as fuck.</v>

318
00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:59.350
<v Speaker 6>These dudes are on the Bob sled run,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's all graffiti'd up and they're </v>

319
00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:02.030
<v Speaker 6>riding bikes on it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That looks fucking bad ass man.</v>

320
00:15:02.031 --> 00:15:04.660
<v Speaker 6>If you lived there dude.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

321
00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:09.920
<v Speaker 6>That would be the coolest shit ever.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you were a kid and you were growing </v>

322
00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:10.310
<v Speaker 6>up in that neighborhood,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but that's probably like a.</v>

323
00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:12.620
<v Speaker 6>was probably got a lot of bullets in </v>
<v Speaker 6>that neighborhood too.</v>

324
00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:15.450
<v Speaker 6>It looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

325
00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:17.840
<v Speaker 6>that's what they're writing away from </v>
<v Speaker 6>rape.</v>

326
00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:22.520
<v Speaker 6>Like all this land,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this land is just ruined.</v>

327
00:15:22.521 --> 00:15:24.000
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>all skills and had dope though.</v>

328
00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:29.020
<v Speaker 6>It's kind of dope right now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but in 20 years that's going to look </v>

329
00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:29.020
<v Speaker 6>even shittier.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Look at that.</v>

330
00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:30.710
<v Speaker 6>A mosquito.</v>

331
00:15:30.711 --> 00:15:32.960

348
00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:19.630
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is a really fascinating man that </v>

349
00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:19.630
<v Speaker 6>we.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Those fuckers now have A.</v>

354
00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:29.120
<v Speaker 6>I heard a lot of criticism of it being a</v>
<v Speaker 6>fluff piece this year.</v>

355
00:16:29.121 --> 00:16:30.710
<v Speaker 6>A lot of people saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hey,</v>

356
00:16:30.711 --> 00:16:32.930
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to look at all these </v>
<v Speaker 6>stories that we're watching.</v>

357
00:16:32.931 --> 00:16:37.931
<v Speaker 6>America's got talent.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I want us just to see sports in the </v>

358
00:16:37.931 --> 00:16:37.931
<v Speaker 6>Olympics.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

359
00:16:37.931 --> 00:16:39.030
<v Speaker 6>there's something to that for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

360
00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:42.050
<v Speaker 6>they're trying to create stars and make </v>
<v Speaker 6>a lot of money and make a lot of Michael</v>

361
00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:44.440
<v Speaker 6>Phelps type people out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The more Michael Show.</v>

362
00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:45.420
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

363
00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:48.560
<v Speaker 6>The more Michael Phelps people come </v>
<v Speaker 6>along to,</v>

364
00:16:48.561 --> 00:16:53.561
<v Speaker 6>the more that's going to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the more you get these super successful </v>

365
00:16:53.561 --> 00:16:53.561
<v Speaker 6>guys that can.</v>

366
00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:58.770
<v Speaker 6>They can,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know how many limpic gold medals </v>

367
00:16:58.770 --> 00:16:59.300
<v Speaker 6>that guy won like 28 or something crazy </v>
<v Speaker 6>white too.</v>

368
00:16:59.301 --> 00:17:04.301
<v Speaker 6>I think you'd have to saying here's a </v>
<v Speaker 6>crazy picture of him in the pool from </v>

369
00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:10.750
<v Speaker 6>this past Olympics and he swimming and </v>
<v Speaker 6>the guy he's beating is looking at him </v>

370
00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:15.611
<v Speaker 6>and there was a meme that said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is the perfect example of losers.</v>

371
00:17:15.621 --> 00:17:17.630
<v Speaker 6>Focus on winners.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Winners.</v>

372
00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:22.640
<v Speaker 6>Winners focus on winning because he's </v>
<v Speaker 6>like just fucking laser beam straight on</v>

373
00:17:22.641 --> 00:17:23.360
<v Speaker 6>the target and the.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

374
00:17:23.361 --> 00:17:25.340
<v Speaker 6>The guy's looking at him like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fuck yeah,</v>

375
00:17:25.370 --> 00:17:27.980
<v Speaker 6>I remember when that picture is so </v>
<v Speaker 6>classic.</v>

376
00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:30.380
<v Speaker 6>That is a man saying,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fuck.</v>

377
00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:32.720
<v Speaker 6>I mean when I was back in the day,</v>
<v Speaker 6>believe it or not,</v>

378
00:17:32.721 --> 00:17:37.721
<v Speaker 6>I was on track.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I remember winning the best tips was </v>

379
00:17:37.721 --> 00:17:37.721
<v Speaker 6>never looked back because every time he </v>
<v Speaker 6>looked back,</v>

380
00:17:37.721 --> 00:17:39.710
<v Speaker 6>that takes like a second off your time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

381
00:17:39.711 --> 00:17:41.570
<v Speaker 6>and that's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If that's what he's doing it,</v>

382
00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:42.320
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he might not,</v>

383
00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:44.450
<v Speaker 6>he might just be breathing and you might</v>
<v Speaker 6>be breathing,</v>

384
00:17:44.451 --> 00:17:46.820
<v Speaker 6>but it certainly looks like he's looking</v>
<v Speaker 6>right at Michael Phelps.</v>

385
00:17:46.821 --> 00:17:48.920
<v Speaker 6>So it's good for the narrative.</v>

386
00:17:51.810 --> 00:17:55.360
<v Speaker 6>It's A.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's interesting that Michael Phelps won</v>

387
00:17:55.410 --> 00:18:00.410
<v Speaker 6>all those gold medals in swimming and </v>
<v Speaker 6>then he became this huge swimming star </v>

388
00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:04.350
<v Speaker 6>because think about how many swimming </v>
<v Speaker 6>stars I've been.</v>

389
00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:09.950
<v Speaker 6>How many other is Greg Louganis who was </v>
<v Speaker 6>more of a diving star that a swimming </v>

390
00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:12.990
<v Speaker 6>star?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Name me another famous swimmer.</v>

391
00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:16.170
<v Speaker 6>Summer Sanders.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know who the fuck that is.</v>

392
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.470
<v Speaker 6>She's not famous like Michael Phelps </v>
<v Speaker 6>that even the neighborhood.</v>

393
00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:24.120
<v Speaker 6>I've never been heard of her.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

394
00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:27.770
<v Speaker 6>no fence Ma'am does nickelodeon shows?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

395
00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:28.960
<v Speaker 6>she did?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

396
00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:31.710
<v Speaker 6>That's Kinda cool.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But Michael Phelps is like,</v>

397
00:18:31.711 --> 00:18:33.660
<v Speaker 6>here's the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>here's how I feel about sports.</v>

398
00:18:33.661 --> 00:18:35.100
<v Speaker 6>If I know your name,</v>
<v Speaker 6>God damn.</v>

399
00:18:35.101 --> 00:18:37.410
<v Speaker 6>He wants to be famous because I barely </v>
<v Speaker 6>pay attention.</v>

400
00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:41.130
<v Speaker 6>So that's how I looked like I knew about</v>
<v Speaker 6>Michael Phelps years and years and years</v>

401
00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:42.810
<v Speaker 6>and years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So if I know about him,</v>

402
00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:47.900
<v Speaker 6>he's got to be famous as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's crazy that like every now and then </v>

403
00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:49.560
<v Speaker 6>a sport,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we'll give you a one super famous person</v>

404
00:18:50.010 --> 00:18:51.990
<v Speaker 6>like one Lance Armstrong,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Tony Hawk,</v>

405
00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:54.810
<v Speaker 6>and then once we got one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's it.</v>

406
00:18:56.850 --> 00:18:59.250
<v Speaker 6>You Got Michael Phelps.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There was all these other guys that were</v>

407
00:18:59.251 --> 00:19:04.251
<v Speaker 6>on a relay with him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They didn't even mention that fucking </v>

408
00:19:04.251 --> 00:19:04.620
<v Speaker 6>Niggas over here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Nobody cares about that guy.</v>

409
00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:08.040
<v Speaker 6>They barely paid attention.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They just focused all on Phillips Golf.</v>

410
00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:09.870
<v Speaker 6>Name three names and golf.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

411
00:19:09.871 --> 00:19:11.040
<v Speaker 6>this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's right.</v>

412
00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:12.630
<v Speaker 6>Mark Spitz.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's right.</v>

413
00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:17.810
<v Speaker 6>I don't remember that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He was a [inaudible] 76 Olympics I </v>

414
00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:17.810
<v Speaker 6>think.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is that right?</v>

415
00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:22.320
<v Speaker 6>It has to be.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He looks like Burt Reynolds from </v>

416
00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:22.320
<v Speaker 6>deliverance was 72 72.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

417
00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:22.590
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's right.</v>

418
00:19:22.591 --> 00:19:23.760
<v Speaker 6>I forgot about that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

419
00:19:23.761 --> 00:19:28.761
<v Speaker 6>So he was the first of the um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the superstar Michael Phelps type </v>

420
00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:33.950
<v Speaker 6>swimmer dudes I think before,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I want to say before Phelps came along </v>

421
00:19:34.591 --> 00:19:39.591
<v Speaker 6>and I really don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I think that Spitz was the guy who </v>

422
00:19:39.591 --> 00:19:39.591
<v Speaker 6>won the most gold medals up until that </v>
<v Speaker 6>moment.</v>

423
00:19:39.591 --> 00:19:42.300
<v Speaker 6>And then Phelps just fucking blew him </v>
<v Speaker 6>out of the water.</v>

424
00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:44.790
<v Speaker 6>Where is he now?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

425
00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:49.910
<v Speaker 6>if I had to guess by the way it looks </v>
<v Speaker 6>and an burt reynolds movie from the </v>

426
00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:51.140
<v Speaker 6>Nineteen Seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

427
00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:53.460
<v Speaker 6>look at him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I hope that guy still rocks that.</v>

428
00:19:53.461 --> 00:19:58.461
<v Speaker 6>Look.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wonder if being in water more than a </v>

429
00:19:58.461 --> 00:20:01.580
<v Speaker 6>more average,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the average person is better or worse </v>

430
00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:01.580
<v Speaker 6>for your,</v>
<v Speaker 6>your skin.</v>

431
00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:05.241
<v Speaker 6>For every.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Probably worse because chlorine is not </v>

432
00:20:05.241 --> 00:20:05.241
<v Speaker 6>good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sure.</v>

433
00:20:05.241 --> 00:20:09.500
<v Speaker 6>It's not good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Chlorine kills everything that's in the </v>

434
00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:11.790
<v Speaker 6>water,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it also fucks with the floor of your</v>

435
00:20:11.791 --> 00:20:16.791
<v Speaker 6>own skin.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like it's not the best stuff in the </v>

436
00:20:16.791 --> 00:20:18.330
<v Speaker 6>world for your skin.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's sterile water.</v>

437
00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:20.370
<v Speaker 6>What about saltwater?</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's probably better for you.</v>

438
00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:21.370
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Let's say salt.</v>

439
00:20:21.371 --> 00:20:22.860
<v Speaker 6>Water is better for you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

440
00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:26.790
<v Speaker 6>So water is interesting man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because I can't get it in my eyes.</v>

441
00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:28.380
<v Speaker 6>I know some people can get it in their </v>
<v Speaker 6>eyes.</v>

442
00:20:28.381 --> 00:20:30.960
<v Speaker 6>They don't have a problem with it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I get in my eyes and fucking stings.</v>

443
00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:33.720
<v Speaker 6>I don't know why.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like when I go to,</v>

444
00:20:33.721 --> 00:20:34.770
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

445
00:20:34.771 --> 00:20:35.550
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the beach,</v>

446
00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:37.670
<v Speaker 6>if I get water in my eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it fucking stinks.</v>

447
00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:42.750
<v Speaker 6>Is that add to your sodium levels?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Mark Spitz wasn't even using a swim cap.</v>

448
00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:44.220
<v Speaker 6>When you're saying in your eyes were </v>
<v Speaker 6>stinging.</v>

449
00:20:44.221 --> 00:20:45.950
<v Speaker 6>He doesn't have goggles on either.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's got.</v>

450
00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:48.130
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I'm talking about a pool.</v>

451
00:20:48.131 --> 00:20:50.710
<v Speaker 6>He swam in a pool and the ocean is where</v>
<v Speaker 6>my eyes sting.</v>

452
00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:52.720
<v Speaker 6>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

453
00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:57.750
<v Speaker 6>Mark Spitz was old school is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fuck you probably swam in a flannel </v>

454
00:20:57.750 --> 00:20:57.750
<v Speaker 6>shirt.</v>

455
00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:05.040
<v Speaker 6>Those look at his body.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Short shorts have probably made from </v>

456
00:21:05.171 --> 00:21:10.171
<v Speaker 6>like red dye number nine.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They didn't do any strength and </v>

457
00:21:10.171 --> 00:21:10.171
<v Speaker 6>conditioning back there stops throwing </v>
<v Speaker 6>me.</v>

458
00:21:10.171 --> 00:21:12.420
<v Speaker 6>Just men in their underwear.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Jamie stop it.</v>

459
00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:17.640
<v Speaker 6>The iconic speedo endures.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So this a go to full body on this </v>

460
00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:20.200
<v Speaker 6>gentlemen.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Look at his fucking body man.</v>

461
00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:21.220
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you mean,</v>

462
00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:24.970
<v Speaker 6>I guess he kind of looks like an athlete</v>
<v Speaker 6>or he looks like a,</v>

463
00:21:24.971 --> 00:21:27.300
<v Speaker 6>your girlfriend's brother that's staying</v>
<v Speaker 6>with her over the.</v>

464
00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:28.630
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you get up in the morning,</v>

465
00:21:28.631 --> 00:21:30.430
<v Speaker 6>you meet him for the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well how are you doing man?</v>

466
00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:31.960
<v Speaker 6>Nice to meet you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh Hey man.</v>

467
00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:34.540
<v Speaker 6>Y'All got soap.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like that's what he looks like.</v>

468
00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:40.060
<v Speaker 6>He's like some,</v>
<v Speaker 6>some weird fucking dude might've worked </v>

469
00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:41.770
<v Speaker 6>out a couple of times in his underwear.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

470
00:21:41.771 --> 00:21:46.771
<v Speaker 6>why are you just standing your in your </v>
<v Speaker 6>underwear like that dude with gold </v>

471
00:21:46.771 --> 00:21:48.400
<v Speaker 6>chains around your neck?</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is a fucking strange picture.</v>

472
00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:52.990
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't really look to swimmer body </v>
<v Speaker 6>either.</v>

473
00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:58.220
<v Speaker 6>Like the difference between that body </v>
<v Speaker 6>and Michael Phelps body or any swimmer </v>

474
00:21:58.220 --> 00:21:58.220
<v Speaker 6>nowadays.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like pretty different.</v>

475
00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:00.130
<v Speaker 6>Like his legs actually seemed kind of </v>
<v Speaker 6>Chubby.</v>

476
00:22:00.131 --> 00:22:00.730
<v Speaker 6>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh.</v>

477
00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:03.370
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They don't really seem muscular.</v>

478
00:22:03.371 --> 00:22:07.550
<v Speaker 6>They kind of seem sexy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but what I'm just strengthened.</v>

479
00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:10.060
<v Speaker 6>But does Michael Phelps do strength and </v>
<v Speaker 6>conditioning workouts?</v>

480
00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:14.020
<v Speaker 6>I know he does that crazy cupping shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're paying attention to that?</v>

481
00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:16.930
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Everybody's copying these days.</v>

482
00:22:16.931 --> 00:22:18.500
<v Speaker 6>He's wacky.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Kids saw that and that.</v>

483
00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:20.950
<v Speaker 6>That falls into the chiropractor.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Bullshit stuff,</v>

484
00:22:20.951 --> 00:22:25.951
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like the like there's real no science </v>

485
00:22:25.951 --> 00:22:26.350
<v Speaker 6>behind it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've just anecdotal evidence.</v>

486
00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:31.650
<v Speaker 6>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think there's been scientific </v>

487
00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:31.650
<v Speaker 6>studies done on unfortunately.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

488
00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:34.750
<v Speaker 6>here's a breakdown of his training.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Routine warmup with Jack Knife crunches,</v>

489
00:22:34.751 --> 00:22:39.751
<v Speaker 6>three sets of 20 pushups,</v>
<v Speaker 6>three tests of 25 to 35 and bodyweight </v>

490
00:22:39.751 --> 00:22:43.590
<v Speaker 6>squats,</v>
<v Speaker 6>three sets of 25 begin the pool with 40 </v>

491
00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:43.590
<v Speaker 6>50 meter drills.</v>

492
00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:48.210
<v Speaker 6>So it's mostly swimming stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which seems like in some body weight </v>

493
00:22:48.251 --> 00:22:50.380
<v Speaker 6>exercises,</v>
<v Speaker 6>crunches and squats,</v>

494
00:22:50.381 --> 00:22:52.720
<v Speaker 6>but the majority of his stuff is about </v>
<v Speaker 6>lapse.</v>

495
00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:55.150
<v Speaker 6>High intensity swim distances of 200 </v>
<v Speaker 6>meters,</v>

496
00:22:55.151 --> 00:22:56.430
<v Speaker 6>150 meters,</v>
<v Speaker 6>100 meters,</v>

497
00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:59.440
<v Speaker 6>50 meters with 30 seconds of rest in </v>
<v Speaker 6>between each interval.</v>

498
00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:03.880
<v Speaker 6>He's a fucking animal.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just think about doing that sprints with</v>

499
00:23:03.881 --> 00:23:06.730
<v Speaker 6>high intensity.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What is a high intensity to the greatest</v>

500
00:23:06.731 --> 00:23:11.731
<v Speaker 6>swimmer of the world's ever known?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Can you even imagine operating those </v>

501
00:23:11.731 --> 00:23:14.550
<v Speaker 6>Rpms that he considered high intensity </v>
<v Speaker 6>when that fucking guy gets going in a </v>

502
00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:15.310
<v Speaker 6>pool,</v>
<v Speaker 6>dude,</v>

503
00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:19.090
<v Speaker 6>get video of him getting super-intense,</v>
<v Speaker 6>getting warmed up for his race the other</v>

504
00:23:19.091 --> 00:23:20.320
<v Speaker 6>day.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

505
00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:22.510
<v Speaker 6>I didn't say it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's kind of funny.</v>

506
00:23:22.511 --> 00:23:23.800
<v Speaker 6>The Dude's dancing around in front of </v>
<v Speaker 6>them.</v>

507
00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:26.550

<v Speaker 6>You've got to be.</v>

509
00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:34.300

<v Speaker 6>powerful mind to be able to do something</v>

510
00:23:34.301 --> 00:23:38.920
<v Speaker 6>that everybody can do like swim and do </v>
<v Speaker 6>it faster than anybody ever.</v>

511
00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:45.540
<v Speaker 6>You got to be a fucking real super </v>
<v Speaker 6>focused psycho mean psycho in a bad way.</v>

512
00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:50.270
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 6>Stairs.</v>

524
00:24:15.951 --> 00:24:19.520
<v Speaker 6>Adhd for today's millennials.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Started with natural born killers.</v>

525
00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:23.930
<v Speaker 6>So one guy is like dancing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like he's not even dancing.</v>

526
00:24:23.931 --> 00:24:27.020
<v Speaker 6>He's like shadow boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is that going to have fighter team?</v>

527
00:24:27.021 --> 00:24:30.170
<v Speaker 6>South America?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why is he staring at Michael Phelps?</v>

528
00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:35.590
<v Speaker 6>And he's just showing off for him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like he's like shaking in front of them </v>

529
00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:37.760
<v Speaker 6>and laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Michael Phelps does not give a fuck.</v>

530
00:24:37.850 --> 00:24:39.230
<v Speaker 6>He's probably happy that guy's doing </v>
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>

531
00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:41.450
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's a little test,</v>

532
00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:45.530
<v Speaker 6>a little test for him to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just continuous stare of death.</v>

533
00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:47.480
<v Speaker 6>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's pretty funny man.</v>

534
00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:50.690
<v Speaker 6>He's probably listening to some killer </v>
<v Speaker 6>creed music or something.</v>

535
00:24:50.691 --> 00:24:55.010
<v Speaker 6>And His earphones because Michael Phelps</v>
<v Speaker 6>listened to my dad.</v>

536
00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:00.020
<v Speaker 6>He doesn't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That is weird.</v>

537
00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:05.170
<v Speaker 6>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think you just got to be that guy if </v>

<v Speaker 6>Nobody ever.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

540
00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:08.570
<v Speaker 6>Who else was that intense?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Nobody.</v>

541
00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:10.850
<v Speaker 6>Nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He takes it on to the next level.</v>

542
00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:14.480
<v Speaker 6>God Damn crazy people out there winning </v>
<v Speaker 6>gold medals.</v>

543
00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:17.870
<v Speaker 6>Pretty fucking impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Smokes.</v>

544
00:25:17.871 --> 00:25:18.680
<v Speaker 6>A lot of wheat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I hear.</v>

545
00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:20.630
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sabika weed.</v>

546
00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:24.470
<v Speaker 6>Did you hear about the dea this morning?</v>
<v Speaker 6>That really pissed me off.</v>

547
00:25:24.650 --> 00:25:27.860
<v Speaker 6>They decided not to reclassify </v>
<v Speaker 6>marijuana.</v>

548
00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:31.940
<v Speaker 6>So they're keeping it in the same </v>
<v Speaker 6>category as heroin and stuff.</v>

549
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.150
<v Speaker 6>They decided that it has no medical </v>
<v Speaker 6>benefits.</v>

550
00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:41.260
<v Speaker 6>Why can't we just take him to one of </v>
<v Speaker 6>these kids that have seizures and just </v>

551
00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:41.260
<v Speaker 6>go here,</v>
<v Speaker 6>watch,</v>

552
00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:43.430
<v Speaker 6>see seizure now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>See no seizure.</v>

553
00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:44.780
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Shut the fuck up.</v>

554
00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:47.360
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>common sense knows common sense here,</v>

555
00:25:47.361 --> 00:25:47.600
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

556
00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:48.350
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean that's,</v>

557
00:25:48.351 --> 00:25:51.290
<v Speaker 6>that's definitely evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But I mean there's many,</v>

558
00:25:51.291 --> 00:25:56.291
<v Speaker 6>many cases of that that is evidence that</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's tests being done on these </v>

559
00:25:56.291 --> 00:25:57.680
<v Speaker 6>children in the real world and it's </v>
<v Speaker 6>working.</v>

560
00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:00.110
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whether or not it's scientific,</v>

561
00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:01.670
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>double blind,</v>

562
00:26:01.671 --> 00:26:03.170
<v Speaker 6>placebo controlled evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

563
00:26:03.171 --> 00:26:07.760
<v Speaker 6>but there's plenty of evidence about the</v>
<v Speaker 6>medicinal benefits of cannabis.</v>

564
00:26:07.790 --> 00:26:09.170
<v Speaker 6>There's plenty of it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's plenty.</v>

565
00:26:09.171 --> 00:26:14.171
<v Speaker 6>There's.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's all sorts of data that seems to </v>

566
00:26:14.171 --> 00:26:14.360
<v Speaker 6>indicate that it has some sort of a role</v>
<v Speaker 6>in reducing tumors.</v>

567
00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:17.690
<v Speaker 6>It can.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It definitely helps people with anxiety.</v>

568
00:26:17.691 --> 00:26:22.691
<v Speaker 6>There's A.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot of factors that it does </v>

569
00:26:22.691 --> 00:26:23.300
<v Speaker 6>that like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when Neal Brennan was on,</v>

570
00:26:23.301 --> 00:26:25.090
<v Speaker 6>he was talking about antidepressants and</v>
<v Speaker 6>he was like,</v>

571
00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:29.420
<v Speaker 6>they don't exactly know how they work </v>
<v Speaker 6>and that's a really good point,</v>

572
00:26:29.421 --> 00:26:32.330
<v Speaker 6>but they sell fucking ton of different </v>
<v Speaker 6>kinds of antidepressants.</v>

573
00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:37.720
<v Speaker 6>They know how cannabis works.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They know that there's cannabinoid </v>

574
00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:40.691
<v Speaker 6>receptors in the human mind,</v>
<v Speaker 6>meaning the human brain is designed or </v>

575
00:26:40.791 --> 00:26:44.070
<v Speaker 6>grew up or developed alongside</v>

576
00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:46.050
<v Speaker 1>cannabis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It knows what to do with it,</v>

577
00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:51.030
<v Speaker 1>so when you take marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body knows what it is.</v>

578
00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:55.380
<v Speaker 1>Your body even produces some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>cannabinoid response.</v>

579
00:26:55.381 --> 00:27:00.381
<v Speaker 1>When you run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's part of what you're getting in </v>

580
00:27:00.381 --> 00:27:00.381
<v Speaker 1>the runner's high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say it's similar.</v>

581
00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:01.950
<v Speaker 1>Is that correct?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's correct.</v>

582
00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:07.250
<v Speaker 1>How is this a true statement that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>add in there that they don't know the </v>

583
00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:08.400
<v Speaker 1>drugs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chemistry is not known or reproducible,</v>

584
00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:13.980
<v Speaker 1>that says no current obsession,</v>
<v Speaker 1>accepted medical use because the drugs </v>

585
00:27:14.161 --> 00:27:17.160
<v Speaker 1>chemistry is not reproducible,</v>

586
00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.950
<v Speaker 1>not known,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and reproducible means what?</v>

587
00:27:20.951 --> 00:27:22.450
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meaning drugs.</v>

588
00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:26.260
<v Speaker 1>Chemistry is not known in reproducible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meaning they can't create it in a lab.</v>

589
00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:29.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or they can't make two of the same.</v>

590
00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:32.470
<v Speaker 1>Maybe Maggie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't keep the same.</v>

591
00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:34.880
<v Speaker 1>You can't clone the same person over and</v>
<v Speaker 1>over again.</v>

592
00:27:34.930 --> 00:27:39.930
<v Speaker 1>Every time he hits a different person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe because when you get it as </v>

593
00:27:39.930 --> 00:27:43.141
<v Speaker 1>marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's hundreds of different types of </v>

594
00:27:43.141 --> 00:27:43.960
<v Speaker 1>cannabinoids apparently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're not just getting thc.</v>

595
00:27:43.961 --> 00:27:46.400
<v Speaker 1>You're getting all kinds of other groovy</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit in there too,</v>

596
00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:50.110
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a ton of different types</v>

597
00:27:50.111 --> 00:27:55.111
<v Speaker 1>of cannabinoids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's go down a little fucking </v>

598
00:27:55.111 --> 00:27:55.300
<v Speaker 1>information whole young Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many things?</v>

599
00:27:55.330 --> 00:28:00.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's 100 different types of </v>

600
00:28:00.330 --> 00:28:00.550
<v Speaker 1>cannabinoids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think?</v>

601
00:28:01.150 --> 00:28:03.350
<v Speaker 1>I would guess over a thousand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>

602
00:28:03.550 --> 00:28:08.550
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also think it's 12 hours to the </v>

603
00:28:08.550 --> 00:28:08.550
<v Speaker 1>Pentagon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>80 five.</v>

604
00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:11.980
<v Speaker 1>Cannabis contains at least 85 types of </v>
<v Speaker 1>cannabinoids.</v>

605
00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:14.260
<v Speaker 1>Many which have documented medical </v>
<v Speaker 1>value.</v>

606
00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:16.870
<v Speaker 1>That was 2014.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They probably found new ones.</v>

607
00:28:16.871 --> 00:28:17.860
<v Speaker 1>Bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

608
00:28:17.861 --> 00:28:22.861
<v Speaker 1>now there's only over 480 natural </v>
<v Speaker 1>components found in the cannabis sativa </v>

609
00:28:22.861 --> 00:28:23.500
<v Speaker 1>plant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

610
00:28:23.770 --> 00:28:26.050
<v Speaker 1>there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's different.</v>

611
00:28:26.290 --> 00:28:31.290
<v Speaker 1>So it's 480 natural components.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So 113 different canabinoids says one in</v>

612
00:28:33.521 --> 00:28:35.770
<v Speaker 1>wicken in wikipedia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

613
00:28:35.771 --> 00:28:37.770
<v Speaker 1>it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

614
00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:39.070
<v Speaker 1>scroll down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One more.</v>

615
00:28:39.071 --> 00:28:40.810
<v Speaker 1>The one that says how many different </v>
<v Speaker 1>cannabinoids?</v>

616
00:28:42.250 --> 00:28:43.500
<v Speaker 1>Sixty four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

617
00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:47.260
<v Speaker 1>So at the answers vary depending on </v>
<v Speaker 1>studying year.</v>

618
00:28:47.261 --> 00:28:48.930
<v Speaker 1>This is the most recent one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

619
00:28:49.010 --> 00:28:53.050
<v Speaker 1>This is 2000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hundred 11.</v>

620
00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:58.080
<v Speaker 1>I think that's this 1964.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you scroll up it's the post is </v>

621
00:28:58.080 --> 00:28:59.570
<v Speaker 1>from 2015.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

622
00:28:59.590 --> 00:29:01.330
<v Speaker 1>So I don't think this is old information</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

623
00:29:01.331 --> 00:29:06.331
<v Speaker 1>There wouldn't be used in 2011 data </v>
<v Speaker 1>would they just says that the thc was </v>

624
00:29:06.331 --> 00:29:07.990
<v Speaker 1>first discovered in 1964.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

625
00:29:07.991 --> 00:29:09.190
<v Speaker 1>that's really crazy that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

626
00:29:09.191 --> 00:29:14.191
<v Speaker 1>when they're talking about like data </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're talking about like well they </v>

627
00:29:14.191 --> 00:29:15.160
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't be using data from like 20 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>

628
00:29:15.570 --> 00:29:20.570
<v Speaker 1>like fucking ads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't know shit back then when we </v>

629
00:29:20.570 --> 00:29:21.890
<v Speaker 1>really do kind of think about it that </v>
<v Speaker 1>way sometimes.</v>

630
00:29:22.130 --> 00:29:27.130
<v Speaker 1>Like somebody sent me something the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other day that was from three years ago </v>

631
00:29:27.130 --> 00:29:27.980
<v Speaker 1>and I immediately was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking three years old,</v>

632
00:29:28.010 --> 00:29:32.360
<v Speaker 1>but it was a really interesting story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but unless it was happening that week,</v>

633
00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:35.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what that.</v>

634
00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:37.880
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's weird.</v>

635
00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:41.720
<v Speaker 7>That sounds like an assumption.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Everyone.</v>

636
00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:46.830
<v Speaker 7>Other people have done more research up </v>
<v Speaker 7>until now and I've looked at that maybe </v>

637
00:29:46.830 --> 00:29:51.540
<v Speaker 7>I would assume that a lot of times I </v>
<v Speaker 7>think if I saw something that said it </v>

638
00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:54.661
<v Speaker 7>was last month,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I would think at least five people I've </v>

639
00:29:54.661 --> 00:29:56.761
<v Speaker 7>seen it since then.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And snopes stood out and wrote another </v>

640
00:29:56.761 --> 00:29:56.761
<v Speaker 7>article.</v>

641
00:29:56.761 --> 00:29:57.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not even that.</v>

642
00:29:57.540 --> 00:30:00.270
<v Speaker 1>It's an actual news event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not at non.</v>

643
00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:03.450
<v Speaker 1>It's not debatable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just an actual news event from two years</v>

644
00:30:03.451 --> 00:30:05.040
<v Speaker 1>ago is bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck about it.</v>

645
00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:11.300
<v Speaker 1>It's weird like you look down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like whenever there's an article that </v>

646
00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:15.801
<v Speaker 1>someone will tweet or I find online or </v>
<v Speaker 1>reading it on dig or something like </v>

647
00:30:15.801 --> 00:30:19.881
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I find an old article or if I'm </v>

648
00:30:19.881 --> 00:30:23.661
<v Speaker 1>researching the subject,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I just start googling it and find </v>

649
00:30:23.661 --> 00:30:24.900
<v Speaker 1>something from 2013,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I all almost instantly go.</v>

650
00:30:25.250 --> 00:30:29.280
<v Speaker 1>It's like three years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man sold back then.</v>

651
00:30:29.281 --> 00:30:32.970
<v Speaker 1>They didn't know anything back then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also like two,</v>

652
00:30:32.971 --> 00:30:34.770
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight phone generations old too.</v>

653
00:30:34.771 --> 00:30:37.360
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what you think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

654
00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:41.550
<v Speaker 1>I know you see someone like from 2003 </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a flip phone,</v>

655
00:30:41.551 --> 00:30:43.140
<v Speaker 1>you want to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fucking moron.</v>

656
00:30:43.150 --> 00:30:44.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking very matrix</v>

657
00:30:45.530 --> 00:30:47.750
<v Speaker 7>that they just had like those little </v>
<v Speaker 7>slide out phones.</v>

658
00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:50.480
<v Speaker 7>No concept of what an iphone was even </v>
<v Speaker 7>going to be.</v>

659
00:30:50.481 --> 00:30:55.481
<v Speaker 7>Then I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and they weren't even discussing what </v>

660
00:30:55.481 --> 00:30:55.481
<v Speaker 7>that would have been like to have social</v>
<v Speaker 7>media or any.</v>

661
00:30:55.481 --> 00:30:57.680
<v Speaker 7>They're just texting each other I think.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And making phone calls.</v>

662
00:30:57.740 --> 00:30:58.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

663
00:30:58.550 --> 00:31:01.970
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the interesting things </v>
<v Speaker 1>about science fiction,</v>

664
00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:07.320
<v Speaker 1>is it science fiction is a really poor </v>
<v Speaker 1>indicator of what the future holds in </v>

665
00:31:07.401 --> 00:31:09.020
<v Speaker 1>most situations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

666
00:31:09.021 --> 00:31:11.840
<v Speaker 1>like no one who did star wars or star </v>
<v Speaker 1>Trek,</v>

667
00:31:11.841 --> 00:31:14.840
<v Speaker 1>they didn't think there would be able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate with each other in real time</v>

668
00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:19.870
<v Speaker 1>all around the world through video and </v>
<v Speaker 1>send emails and get all the information,</v>

669
00:31:20.571 --> 00:31:25.571
<v Speaker 1>but anything you wanted to get at any </v>
<v Speaker 1>given time wirelessly through the air </v>

670
00:31:25.571 --> 00:31:27.560
<v Speaker 1>and a little thing that's so small,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's slides in your front pocket.</v>

671
00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:29.240
<v Speaker 1>Nobody ever thought that was coming.</v>

672
00:31:30.170 --> 00:31:33.370
<v Speaker 3>Now Dee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the day they just said how they're doing</v>

673
00:31:33.371 --> 00:31:36.250
<v Speaker 3>like the five g right now and how back </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the day,</v>

674
00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:39.880
<v Speaker 3>you know we started off with three g or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever way tbg and stuff like that and</v>

675
00:31:40.150 --> 00:31:45.100
<v Speaker 3>now I think there's only a few countries</v>
<v Speaker 3>where 75 percent of the country is still</v>

676
00:31:45.101 --> 00:31:48.430
<v Speaker 3>using two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two g or three G and how they've run out</v>

677
00:31:48.431 --> 00:31:53.431
<v Speaker 3>of frequencies to build the five g.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But or so now they're going to have to </v>

678
00:31:53.431 --> 00:31:56.770
<v Speaker 3>start just kicking people off the two G </v>
<v Speaker 3>and three g and stuff like that.</v>

679
00:31:56.771 --> 00:31:58.900
<v Speaker 3>But back then we had three gene.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were like,</v>

680
00:31:58.930 --> 00:31:59.860
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is great.</v>

681
00:31:59.861 --> 00:32:02.560
<v Speaker 3>We can send text messages and we could </v>
<v Speaker 3>send pictures.</v>

682
00:32:02.561 --> 00:32:03.250
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't,</v>

683
00:32:03.251 --> 00:32:06.640
<v Speaker 3>weren't even thinking about Netflix,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hd streaming,</v>

684
00:32:06.641 --> 00:32:06.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

685
00:32:07.050 --> 00:32:12.050
<v Speaker 1>I was just thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if he gets kicked off because this </v>

686
00:32:12.050 --> 00:32:12.720
<v Speaker 1>phone can't keep up with the new shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's definitely happening.</v>

687
00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:17.780
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking maybe they should make a </v>
<v Speaker 1>new phone called the throwback for </v>

688
00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:19.590
<v Speaker 1>people like Ari and then this phone just</v>
<v Speaker 1>only has numbers on it.</v>

689
00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:24.740
<v Speaker 1>Can't even text.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Call me bitch a windows phone doesn't </v>

690
00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:28.251
<v Speaker 1>even get a text message.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just gets calls like an old Motorola </v>

691
00:32:28.251 --> 00:32:28.490
<v Speaker 1>Tristar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tristar.</v>

692
00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:29.570
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Talk</v>

693
00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:32.430
<v Speaker 7>to my dad about this today.</v>
<v Speaker 7>How important is that phone number still</v>

694
00:32:32.490 --> 00:32:37.490
<v Speaker 7>to like a person is.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like because there's so many </v>

695
00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:40.521
<v Speaker 7>different ways to communicate and you </v>
<v Speaker 7>can communicate through voice and video </v>

696
00:32:40.521 --> 00:32:40.521
<v Speaker 7>that facebook</v>

697
00:32:40.521 --> 00:32:42.470
<v Speaker 3>through facetime,</v>
<v Speaker 3>audio and Wifi.</v>

698
00:32:43.030 --> 00:32:45.780
<v Speaker 3>Do you really still need that 10 digit </v>
<v Speaker 3>phone number?</v>

699
00:32:45.810 --> 00:32:48.020
<v Speaker 3>Change my phone number almost every year</v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

700
00:32:48.290 --> 00:32:53.290
<v Speaker 3>And it's nowadays it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a better way to weed out people </v>

701
00:32:53.290 --> 00:32:54.200
<v Speaker 3>that shouldn't have your phone number.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I used to think that,</v>

702
00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:56.660
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had this number since I was 14,</v>

703
00:32:56.661 --> 00:32:59.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and now I don't give a fuck anymore.</v>

704
00:33:00.170 --> 00:33:04.370
<v Speaker 3>I know I keep my phone on the sleep mode</v>
<v Speaker 3>or whatever the,</v>

705
00:33:04.371 --> 00:33:09.371
<v Speaker 3>the moon that doesn't let any phone </v>
<v Speaker 3>calls go through and it doesn't </v>

706
00:33:09.371 --> 00:33:11.500
<v Speaker 3>interrupt you with alerts or anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

707
00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:14.510
<v Speaker 3>but if somebody calls you like two times</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a row or three times in a row it goes</v>

708
00:33:14.511 --> 00:33:15.630
<v Speaker 3>through,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it,</v>

709
00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:20.640
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I accidentally leave it on all the </v>

710
00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:20.640
<v Speaker 3>time and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

711
00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:21.770
<v Speaker 3>this is so peaceful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not hearing my fucking phone beeping and</v>

712
00:33:21.771 --> 00:33:26.771
<v Speaker 3>ringing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I think that's important because </v>

713
00:33:26.771 --> 00:33:29.411
<v Speaker 3>I think we forget that we didn't have </v>
<v Speaker 3>that growing up most of our lives and </v>

714
00:33:29.411 --> 00:33:31.760
<v Speaker 3>now it's almost like an alarm clock </v>
<v Speaker 3>going off every two minutes.</v>

715
00:33:31.790 --> 00:33:33.230
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>

716
00:33:33.290 --> 00:33:35.870
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't give you a chance to live </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a normal life.</v>

717
00:33:35.930 --> 00:33:39.590
<v Speaker 3>If you're constantly updating yourself </v>
<v Speaker 3>with twitter or with</v>

718
00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:41.760
<v Speaker 4>text messages and you're constantly </v>
<v Speaker 4>looking at it.</v>

719
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:47.000
<v Speaker 4>That's what your focus is on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's almost like you're not even </v>

720
00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.701
<v Speaker 4>living your life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're living your life through this </v>

721
00:33:49.701 --> 00:33:51.831
<v Speaker 4>screen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you're going into another world </v>

722
00:33:51.831 --> 00:33:54.411
<v Speaker 4>like this artificially created world and</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's how you're existing in a world </v>

723
00:33:54.411 --> 00:33:56.550
<v Speaker 4>where no one's talking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If they are talking to,</v>

724
00:33:56.551 --> 00:33:58.470
<v Speaker 4>talking to you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you click on a video,</v>

725
00:33:58.650 --> 00:34:03.650
<v Speaker 4>who you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most of the time what's going on as </v>

726
00:34:03.650 --> 00:34:05.751
<v Speaker 4>you're reading stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're reading stuff or someone sending </v>

727
00:34:05.751 --> 00:34:05.751
<v Speaker 4>something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lol.</v>

728
00:34:05.751 --> 00:34:05.880
<v Speaker 4>They're sending you a funny meme.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>

729
00:34:05.881 --> 00:34:06.810
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

730
00:34:06.811 --> 00:34:07.310
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

731
00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:11.160
<v Speaker 4>there's those things and that's like how</v>
<v Speaker 4>people are living.</v>

732
00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:14.790
<v Speaker 4>Like people are like seeking out funny </v>
<v Speaker 4>instagram posts,</v>

733
00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:16.150
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and like I,</v>

734
00:34:16.151 --> 00:34:21.151
<v Speaker 4>I have friends that have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they subscribed to like 10 different </v>

735
00:34:21.151 --> 00:34:23.700
<v Speaker 4>funny instagram meme posts and just </v>
<v Speaker 4>every 15 seconds they'll look at it,</v>

736
00:34:23.701 --> 00:34:26.290
<v Speaker 4>their phone going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>

737
00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:28.260
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you can do that.</v>

738
00:34:28.261 --> 00:34:33.261
<v Speaker 4>Like you can be fucking perpetually </v>
<v Speaker 4>entertained all day if you choose to do </v>

739
00:34:33.261 --> 00:34:37.671
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you follow the right instagram memes </v>

740
00:34:37.671 --> 00:34:40.520
<v Speaker 4>and you have the right people on twitter</v>
<v Speaker 4>that send you the interesting shit </v>

741
00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:43.850
<v Speaker 4>because there's always something new.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's always some new fucking crazy </v>

742
00:34:43.850 --> 00:34:44.850
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to be constant,</v>

743
00:34:44.970 --> 00:34:46.020
<v Speaker 4>constantly entertained.</v>

744
00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:52.350
<v Speaker 3>Going back to the marijuana thing with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the dea that they had that happen,</v>

745
00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:56.750
<v Speaker 3>they had to read or do that because the </v>
<v Speaker 3>governor got so many signed petitions or</v>

746
00:34:56.760 --> 00:35:01.760
<v Speaker 3>assigned names that it forced them to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to reclassify the marijuana.</v>

747
00:35:01.921 --> 00:35:05.520
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what governor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but whoever it was,</v>

748
00:35:05.610 --> 00:35:06.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they,</v>

749
00:35:06.361 --> 00:35:11.361
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they acquiesce to the demands of the </v>

750
00:35:11.361 --> 00:35:11.361
<v Speaker 3>Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

751
00:35:11.361 --> 00:35:12.150
<v Speaker 3>We definitely didn't do it enough then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

752
00:35:12.151 --> 00:35:16.020
<v Speaker 3>So if more ramped up and they say that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they couldn't clot,</v>

753
00:35:16.070 --> 00:35:21.070
<v Speaker 3>reclassify that to keep it the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they couldn't find any health </v>

754
00:35:21.070 --> 00:35:21.070
<v Speaker 3>benefits from it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

755
00:35:21.070 --> 00:35:25.260
<v Speaker 3>So what happens if the same governor </v>
<v Speaker 3>gets all the signatures to reclassify </v>

756
00:35:25.501 --> 00:35:30.501
<v Speaker 3>cigarettes or alcohol?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What would the da have to say then for </v>

757
00:35:30.501 --> 00:35:34.701
<v Speaker 3>the health benefits of those two?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would they have to reclassify it as </v>

758
00:35:34.701 --> 00:35:35.070
<v Speaker 3>illegal?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very good point.</v>

759
00:35:35.730 --> 00:35:36.810
<v Speaker 3>Let's try it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See what happens.</v>

760
00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:38.100
<v Speaker 3>I'd love to see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very</v>

761
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:39.840
<v Speaker 4>good point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a very good point.</v>

762
00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:45.080
<v Speaker 4>And here's another really good point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The classifying it in schedule one,</v>

763
00:35:45.091 --> 00:35:50.091
<v Speaker 4>because that's where it's been and </v>
<v Speaker 4>because they're they claim there's no </v>

764
00:35:50.091 --> 00:35:52.560
<v Speaker 4>known medical use or it can't be </v>
<v Speaker 4>reproducible.</v>

765
00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:55.350
<v Speaker 4>Whatever the fuck that means you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>grow it dummy.</v>

766
00:35:55.410 --> 00:35:57.750
<v Speaker 4>You can get clones and grow it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course it's reproducible.</v>

767
00:35:57.751 --> 00:36:02.751
<v Speaker 4>It's just reproducible as a plant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what they're saying is it trying to </v>

768
00:36:02.751 --> 00:36:04.470
<v Speaker 4>classify it as a drug,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what they're almost admitting themselves</v>

769
00:36:04.590 --> 00:36:06.720
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if what we're thinking is true.</v>

770
00:36:06.721 --> 00:36:08.340
<v Speaker 4>If what they're saying is that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>can't,</v>

771
00:36:08.850 --> 00:36:13.850
<v Speaker 4>it's not reproducible because it's not a</v>
<v Speaker 4>chemical that you can break down into a </v>

772
00:36:13.850 --> 00:36:18.621
<v Speaker 4>pill if that's what they're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you can't standardize it because </v>

773
00:36:18.621 --> 00:36:18.660
<v Speaker 4>it's too wild and it's free.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's growing.</v>

774
00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:22.310
<v Speaker 4>That's almost a perfect example of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fact that you're.</v>

775
00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:27.440
<v Speaker 4>You're not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You shouldn't be in a position where </v>

776
00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:27.440
<v Speaker 4>you're controlling a plant.</v>

777
00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:30.510
<v Speaker 4>You shouldn't have be in a position </v>
<v Speaker 4>where you're regulating nature,</v>

778
00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:32.940
<v Speaker 4>but that's so you're almost admitting it</v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself.</v>

779
00:36:33.590 --> 00:36:35.580
<v Speaker 4>It's not reproducible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>

780
00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:38.070
<v Speaker 4>If that's what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you're saying it's not a drug.</v>

781
00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:38.910
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

782
00:36:38.911 --> 00:36:41.070
<v Speaker 4>but as a psychoactive effect,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

783
00:36:41.130 --> 00:36:44.430
<v Speaker 4>now you have to prove that psychoactive </v>
<v Speaker 4>effect is dangerous.</v>

784
00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:51.320
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing that's the real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The real problem is classified in the </v>

785
00:36:51.421 --> 00:36:54.570
<v Speaker 4>category of the most dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>harmful drugs.</v>

786
00:36:55.110 --> 00:36:57.520
<v Speaker 4>There is no evidence that that's should </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

787
00:36:57.530 --> 00:36:59.220
<v Speaker 4>That should be correct.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no evidence,</v>

788
00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:04.340
<v Speaker 4>so that's where the dea is failing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're failing way more in that than </v>

789
00:37:04.681 --> 00:37:09.681
<v Speaker 4>they are in even not admitting that </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's medical evidence because if you </v>

790
00:37:09.681 --> 00:37:10.590
<v Speaker 4>wanted to follow it to the strictest </v>
<v Speaker 4>sense of the word,</v>

791
00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:15.860
<v Speaker 4>what studies have been done that have </v>
<v Speaker 4>absolutely been proven in a new modern </v>

792
00:37:17.011 --> 00:37:22.011
<v Speaker 4>form of like the most current science,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what studies have been done that show </v>

793
00:37:22.111 --> 00:37:23.370
<v Speaker 4>the medical benefits of cannabis?</v>

794
00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:28.500
<v Speaker 4>I'm not that many studies being done,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's because it's classified as </v>

795
00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:29.040
<v Speaker 4>schedule one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a total catch 22.</v>

796
00:37:29.250 --> 00:37:34.250
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to get studies done because </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a schedule one and so you can't </v>

797
00:37:34.250 --> 00:37:35.850
<v Speaker 4>prove it shouldn't be a schedule one </v>
<v Speaker 4>because there's not very many studies,</v>

798
00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:38.370
<v Speaker 4>but there's a ton of studies that have </v>
<v Speaker 4>been done by universities.</v>

799
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.880
<v Speaker 4>There's a ton of studies that have shown</v>
<v Speaker 4>positive benefits.</v>

800
00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:45.120
<v Speaker 4>If you want to go back into history,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even back into the Nixon administration,</v>

801
00:37:45.330 --> 00:37:50.330
<v Speaker 4>they were running studies that they </v>
<v Speaker 4>buried the results because the results </v>

802
00:37:50.330 --> 00:37:51.120
<v Speaker 4>showed no harm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They showed nothing.</v>

803
00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:56.300
<v Speaker 4>They can't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so when you follow just straight </v>

804
00:37:56.300 --> 00:37:56.300
<v Speaker 4>science,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no.</v>

805
00:37:56.300 --> 00:37:58.200
<v Speaker 4>There's no evidence whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It should be illegal.</v>

806
00:37:58.380 --> 00:38:03.380
<v Speaker 4>That's the most important thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not evidence of whether it should </v>

807
00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:03.380
<v Speaker 4>be legal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's like,</v>

808
00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:05.640
<v Speaker 4>you know the whole thing about you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>innocent until proven guilty.</v>

809
00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:07.590
<v Speaker 4>It should be the same way about </v>
<v Speaker 4>marijuana.</v>

810
00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:13.280
<v Speaker 4>It should be that you can't just make it</v>
<v Speaker 4>illegal and say it has to remain illegal</v>

811
00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:19.950
<v Speaker 4>because we don't know what it can do </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you do know can do you do.</v>

812
00:38:19.951 --> 00:38:21.990
<v Speaker 4>You definitely know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why do you think that millions of people</v>

813
00:38:21.991 --> 00:38:23.400
<v Speaker 4>like it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are they all crazy?</v>

814
00:38:23.730 --> 00:38:28.730
<v Speaker 4>What's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 4>All these millions and millions of </v>

815
00:38:28.730 --> 00:38:28.730
<v Speaker 4>adults that live in America,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are they fucking crazy?</v>

816
00:38:28.730 --> 00:38:31.350
<v Speaker 4>So what are you saying?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're saying you're smarter than them.</v>

817
00:38:31.650 --> 00:38:36.650
<v Speaker 4>Why don't you talk about it with </v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody that knows what the fuck </v>

818
00:38:36.650 --> 00:38:36.650
<v Speaker 4>they're talking about and you'll get </v>
<v Speaker 4>buried.</v>

819
00:38:36.650 --> 00:38:40.590
<v Speaker 4>Talk about it with a person who's like </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about it with like todd </v>

820
00:38:40.590 --> 00:38:43.531
<v Speaker 4>mccormick committed Tom Mccormick having</v>
<v Speaker 4>a debate with one of these dea guys </v>

821
00:38:43.531 --> 00:38:45.040
<v Speaker 4>about whether or not marijuana is </v>
<v Speaker 4>beneficial.</v>

822
00:38:45.130 --> 00:38:48.580
<v Speaker 4>He survived cancer because of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now a lot of people have.</v>

823
00:38:48.610 --> 00:38:50.950
<v Speaker 4>We have friends that have kids that have</v>
<v Speaker 4>autism.</v>

824
00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:56.160
<v Speaker 4>They give their fucking kids this </v>
<v Speaker 4>medical cannabis and all of a sudden </v>

825
00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:56.160
<v Speaker 4>they can talk.</v>

826
00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:57.520
<v Speaker 4>They relax,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they stop having seizures.</v>

827
00:38:57.910 --> 00:39:01.420
<v Speaker 4>It's a massive benefit to a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

828
00:39:01.570 --> 00:39:04.300
<v Speaker 4>It relaxes people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>makes people feel good,</v>

829
00:39:04.810 --> 00:39:09.810
<v Speaker 4>and we have a government agency in 2016 </v>
<v Speaker 4>that ignores all of that and wants to </v>

830
00:39:10.901 --> 00:39:14.200
<v Speaker 4>keep it in the category of some of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>most harmful and dangerous drugs.</v>

831
00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:17.050
<v Speaker 4>These people that live in an episode of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Hawaii,</v>

832
00:39:17.051 --> 00:39:22.051
<v Speaker 4>five o delivered in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're like 19 fifties people and what </v>

833
00:39:22.961 --> 00:39:27.961
<v Speaker 4>they think they can do is keep this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this bureaucracy and this paperwork and </v>

834
00:39:30.161 --> 00:39:35.161
<v Speaker 4>these classifications in in movement and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they can head off freedom because what </v>

835
00:39:36.731 --> 00:39:41.731
<v Speaker 4>they're trying to do is they're trying </v>
<v Speaker 4>to stop freedom and one of the reasons </v>

836
00:39:41.731 --> 00:39:43.210
<v Speaker 4>why they trap trying to stop freedom is </v>
<v Speaker 4>because they benefit from it.</v>

837
00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:46.120
<v Speaker 4>They benefit from stopping it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have more agents.</v>

838
00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:49.110
<v Speaker 4>If those eight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if all of a sudden most drugs are legal,</v>

839
00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:52.330
<v Speaker 4>what do those fucking thousands of Dea </v>
<v Speaker 4>agents going to do?</v>

840
00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:55.750
<v Speaker 4>They have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're protecting their own industry.</v>

841
00:39:56.080 --> 00:40:01.080
<v Speaker 4>This is a natural thing that any </v>
<v Speaker 4>organism does when it's threatened and </v>

842
00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:04.540
<v Speaker 4>if you start making drugs legal and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>start opening up that conversation like,</v>

843
00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:08.740
<v Speaker 4>who the fuck is any one adult to tell </v>
<v Speaker 4>any other adult,</v>

844
00:40:08.741 --> 00:40:12.430
<v Speaker 4>what's good or bad for you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>When a lot of shit we do,</v>

845
00:40:12.431 --> 00:40:13.600
<v Speaker 4>whether it's the food,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we eat,</v>

846
00:40:13.780 --> 00:40:15.340
<v Speaker 4>the alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we drank the cigarettes,</v>

847
00:40:15.341 --> 00:40:19.480
<v Speaker 4>we smoke the fucking sugar in our diet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All these things are bad for us.</v>

848
00:40:19.481 --> 00:40:22.660
<v Speaker 4>We all know that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we were afraid it was the government</v>

849
00:40:22.661 --> 00:40:25.180
<v Speaker 4>going to come in with a fucking machine </v>
<v Speaker 4>guns to stop you from eating a chocolate</v>

850
00:40:25.181 --> 00:40:27.310
<v Speaker 4>cake and smoking a cigarette.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck that.</v>

851
00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:29.050
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we all agree on that.</v>

852
00:40:29.450 --> 00:40:31.180
<v Speaker 4>If you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If they can't do that,</v>

853
00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:33.190
<v Speaker 4>they shouldn't be able to stop you from </v>
<v Speaker 4>smoking weed.</v>

854
00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:38.400
<v Speaker 4>This is archaic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is like this is some ancient </v>

855
00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:40.810
<v Speaker 4>fucking vampire shit and they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>clinging to civilization.</v>

856
00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:43.510
<v Speaker 4>They are totally irrelevant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>totally irrelevant.</v>

857
00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:48.070
<v Speaker 4>Your decision should be made 100 percent</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the facts that are available today.</v>

858
00:40:48.430 --> 00:40:53.430
<v Speaker 4>You can go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could research all the facts about </v>

859
00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:53.430
<v Speaker 4>matter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Marijuana.</v>

860
00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:56.140
<v Speaker 4>You find a few that make correlations </v>
<v Speaker 4>between some sort of mental illnesses,</v>

861
00:40:56.410 --> 00:40:58.210
<v Speaker 4>but those core,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most of the time,</v>

862
00:40:58.270 --> 00:41:01.540
<v Speaker 4>at least according to experts that I've </v>
<v Speaker 4>listened to talk about it,</v>

863
00:41:02.050 --> 00:41:07.050
<v Speaker 4>the correlations of schizophrenia to </v>
<v Speaker 4>marijuana use are directly in </v>

864
00:41:07.050 --> 00:41:11.791
<v Speaker 4>proportionate with the court.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The numbers of schizophrenia for any </v>

865
00:41:11.791 --> 00:41:15.331
<v Speaker 4>given population that there's always </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to be around one percent of the </v>

866
00:41:15.331 --> 00:41:18.751
<v Speaker 4>population that suffers from some type </v>
<v Speaker 4>of schizophrenia or severe mental </v>

867
00:41:18.751 --> 00:41:19.990
<v Speaker 4>distraction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Illness.</v>

868
00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:21.200
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a bunch of different categories.</v>

869
00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:24.700
<v Speaker 4>These little various mental diseases,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's always that number,</v>

870
00:41:24.970 --> 00:41:29.970
<v Speaker 4>so if they smoked pot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just a thousand people that smoked </v>

871
00:41:29.970 --> 00:41:31.780
<v Speaker 4>pot have schizophrenia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

872
00:41:32.290 --> 00:41:36.110
<v Speaker 4>If there was the same amount of people </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they didn't smoke pot,</v>

873
00:41:36.530 --> 00:41:38.260
<v Speaker 4>it might be the same amount of </v>
<v Speaker 4>schizophrenia,</v>

874
00:41:38.270 --> 00:41:40.340
<v Speaker 4>x,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they might not even be connected,</v>

875
00:41:40.341 --> 00:41:43.880
<v Speaker 4>but when you're talking about 300 </v>
<v Speaker 4>million people and you say 30,000</v>

876
00:41:43.881 --> 00:41:47.150
<v Speaker 4>people got schizophrenia for marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are you fucking sure?</v>

877
00:41:47.590 --> 00:41:50.060
<v Speaker 4>Are you a really fucking sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or is it just 30,000</v>

878
00:41:50.061 --> 00:41:52.880
<v Speaker 4>people have schizophrenia and they also </v>
<v Speaker 4>smoke marijuana.</v>

879
00:41:53.550 --> 00:41:55.820
<v Speaker 4>This is the car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a real problem with the way they</v>

880
00:41:55.821 --> 00:42:00.821
<v Speaker 4>present the data because it's just like </v>
<v Speaker 4>you coming up to me or to Jamie and you </v>

881
00:42:01.101 --> 00:42:05.480
<v Speaker 4>saying you've got new rules.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You as a 42 year old grown ass man.</v>

882
00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:10.870
<v Speaker 4>You have new rules and we did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't want us drinking alcohol </v>

883
00:42:10.870 --> 00:42:10.870
<v Speaker 4>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're gonna.</v>

884
00:42:10.870 --> 00:42:14.410
<v Speaker 4>You're gonna come in and you've hired </v>
<v Speaker 4>guards to keep us from smoking alcohol </v>

885
00:42:14.410 --> 00:42:16.520
<v Speaker 4>or drinking alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the same thing.</v>

886
00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:20.660
<v Speaker 4>If it's a 50,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>people with some big building with three</v>

887
00:42:20.661 --> 00:42:23.720
<v Speaker 4>letters in the front event or whether </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's one crazy fuck,</v>

888
00:42:23.890 --> 00:42:26.360
<v Speaker 4>who wants to stop his neighbor from </v>
<v Speaker 4>smoking pot?</v>

889
00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:29.750
<v Speaker 4>It's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're trying to stop someone from doing</v>

890
00:42:29.751 --> 00:42:32.690
<v Speaker 4>something that's not bad like you can't </v>
<v Speaker 4>do that.</v>

891
00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:34.760
<v Speaker 4>You don't have any evidence that it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>bad.</v>

892
00:42:34.970 --> 00:42:39.970
<v Speaker 4>There should be a fuck load of evidence </v>
<v Speaker 4>that if it's bad and it should be as </v>

893
00:42:39.970 --> 00:42:44.201
<v Speaker 4>much or worse than all the shit that you</v>
<v Speaker 4>know is bad that you sell open and make </v>

894
00:42:44.511 --> 00:42:46.160
<v Speaker 4>money from taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>alcohol,</v>

895
00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:48.080
<v Speaker 4>alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which we both love.</v>

896
00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:49.870
<v Speaker 4>I love,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but here's a great example.</v>

897
00:42:50.170 --> 00:42:53.450
<v Speaker 4>I talk a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just recently released a study that</v>

898
00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:58.480
<v Speaker 4>I think this week showing the like they </v>
<v Speaker 4>proved scientifically that wheat is </v>

899
00:42:59.271 --> 00:43:03.170
<v Speaker 4>better for sex and they not only did it </v>
<v Speaker 4>for pleasures,</v>

900
00:43:03.171 --> 00:43:06.170
<v Speaker 4>but they also explained how when you </v>
<v Speaker 4>have alcohol,</v>

901
00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:08.270
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you cheat more,</v>

<v Speaker 4>She's bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She talking some shit.</v>

918
00:43:59.351 --> 00:44:00.740
<v Speaker 4>She's trying to get people to pay </v>
<v Speaker 4>attention to her.</v>

919
00:44:00.741 --> 00:44:05.741
<v Speaker 4>I mean this will.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Conor mcgregor did so a lot of these </v>

920
00:44:05.741 --> 00:44:06.050
<v Speaker 4>fucking people do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a smart business move.</v>

921
00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:08.960
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that we all should be aware of.</v>

922
00:44:08.961 --> 00:44:10.070
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

923
00:44:10.071 --> 00:44:12.260
<v Speaker 4>it's not just a person saying this is </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone.</v>

924
00:44:12.290 --> 00:44:17.290
<v Speaker 4>It's a smart business move,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so she says this quote about Ronda </v>

925
00:44:17.290 --> 00:44:19.400
<v Speaker 4>Rousey and she says something about </v>
<v Speaker 4>Ronda Rousey having fat arms,</v>

926
00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:23.000
<v Speaker 4>and so the title of this whole piece,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she wants to beat her ass.</v>

927
00:44:23.001 --> 00:44:28.001
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This which she wants to do to Ronda </v>

928
00:44:28.001 --> 00:44:28.001
<v Speaker 4>Rousey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she wants to hold her down and she wants</v>

929
00:44:28.001 --> 00:44:28.760
<v Speaker 4>a mounir.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She wants to elbow her face bloody.</v>

930
00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:32.200
<v Speaker 4>She wants to punch her eyes so that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're swollen and shut down.</v>

931
00:44:32.370 --> 00:44:35.940
<v Speaker 1>She wants to get behind her and choke </v>
<v Speaker 1>her and say nasty shit to where she puts</v>

932
00:44:35.941 --> 00:44:38.160
<v Speaker 1>her unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what she wants to do.</v>

933
00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:39.660
<v Speaker 1>That's what you would like to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

934
00:44:39.661 --> 00:44:41.790
<v Speaker 1>That's what almost all of these fighters</v>
<v Speaker 1>would like to do.</v>

935
00:44:41.791 --> 00:44:45.270
<v Speaker 1>When they're locked in mortal combat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to beat the other person's ass</v>

936
00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:46.670
<v Speaker 1>and they want to choke them out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

937
00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:48.900
<v Speaker 1>The nasty stuff I made,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put that in myself.</v>

938
00:44:49.580 --> 00:44:50.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

939
00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:55.790
<v Speaker 1>point being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen people say some nasty shit to </v>

940
00:44:55.790 --> 00:44:55.790
<v Speaker 1>people whether choking them out by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

941
00:44:55.790 --> 00:44:58.320
<v Speaker 1>but point being that seems to be way </v>
<v Speaker 1>worse than Sanchez fat arms.</v>

942
00:44:58.470 --> 00:45:00.180
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's this going to look like?</v>

943
00:45:00.270 --> 00:45:01.590
<v Speaker 1>What's her face?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look beautiful.</v>

944
00:45:01.770 --> 00:45:02.640
<v Speaker 1>We're going opinions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beautiful.</v>

945
00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:04.680
<v Speaker 1>She's beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's beautiful,</v>

946
00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:06.180
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's Ronda Rousey,</v>

947
00:45:06.181 --> 00:45:11.181
<v Speaker 1>but she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that she said something about </v>

948
00:45:11.181 --> 00:45:11.181
<v Speaker 1>Ronda Rousey having fat arms.</v>

949
00:45:11.181 --> 00:45:15.920
<v Speaker 1>I forget what the quote was about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something about she's over her and you </v>

950
00:45:16.351 --> 00:45:19.920
<v Speaker 1>know the fucking the tie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that it said,</v>

951
00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:24.950
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one cares about Ronda rousey and her </v>

952
00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:24.950
<v Speaker 1>fat arms anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's listen,</v>

953
00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:26.860
<v Speaker 1>that's a funny thing to say and you see </v>
<v Speaker 1>Julia and opinions.</v>

954
00:45:26.890 --> 00:45:28.040
<v Speaker 1>He appreciated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

955
00:45:28.110 --> 00:45:30.180
<v Speaker 1>except for that knows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She just got beat up.</v>

956
00:45:30.181 --> 00:45:32.070
<v Speaker 1>That was a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all swollen up,</v>

957
00:45:32.071 --> 00:45:33.180
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not even beat up.</v>

958
00:45:33.181 --> 00:45:35.850
<v Speaker 1>She's never been beat up and she's a bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>ass.</v>

959
00:45:35.851 --> 00:45:39.060
<v Speaker 1>She's tough and she's trying to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>some try and make some waves.</v>

960
00:45:39.330 --> 00:45:44.330
<v Speaker 1>But the article that I read was talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the fat shaming that women should </v>

961
00:45:44.330 --> 00:45:44.330
<v Speaker 1>never fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shame each other.</v>

962
00:45:44.330 --> 00:45:45.540
<v Speaker 1>Women fighters shouldn't fetch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

963
00:45:45.870 --> 00:45:47.730
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's called talking shit.</v>

964
00:45:48.030 --> 00:45:51.750
<v Speaker 1>It's called talking shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't stop them from talking shit by</v>

965
00:45:51.751 --> 00:45:53.320
<v Speaker 1>putting it to this new category.</v>

966
00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:54.930
<v Speaker 1>Fat Shaming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

967
00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:58.110
<v Speaker 1>That is the most mild form of mockery </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>

968
00:45:59.310 --> 00:46:04.310
<v Speaker 1>A beautiful woman who has big arms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she'll fucking throw you on your head </v>

969
00:46:04.310 --> 00:46:08.241
<v Speaker 1>with those big arms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a reason for those fucking </v>

970
00:46:08.241 --> 00:46:08.241
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

971
00:46:08.241 --> 00:46:08.850
<v Speaker 1>They work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did date a girl with big arms.</v>

972
00:46:08.851 --> 00:46:12.540
<v Speaker 1>It was weird because I say it's so </v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful.</v>

973
00:46:12.570 --> 00:46:17.570
<v Speaker 1>Had a nice body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for some reason her arms are about </v>

974
00:46:17.570 --> 00:46:17.850
<v Speaker 1>double time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if she were the wrong shirts,</v>

975
00:46:17.851 --> 00:46:20.940
<v Speaker 1>it was very uncomfortable to continue to</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at,</v>

976
00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:22.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you have those,</v>

977
00:46:22.081 --> 00:46:27.081
<v Speaker 1>like a sexual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actual paids when you're like a in your </v>

978
00:46:27.081 --> 00:46:27.480
<v Speaker 1>early 19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 years,</v>

979
00:46:27.481 --> 00:46:28.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 20,</v>

980
00:46:28.111 --> 00:46:33.111
<v Speaker 1>21 you have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like sometimes you only meet someone </v>

981
00:46:33.111 --> 00:46:33.111
<v Speaker 1>you've never seen him again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is a,</v>

982
00:46:33.111 --> 00:46:34.530
<v Speaker 1>this is even more interesting because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

983
00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:37.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was no cell phones back then,</v>

984
00:46:37.170 --> 00:46:38.880
<v Speaker 1>so you couldn't really get in touch with</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that well,</v>

985
00:46:38.881 --> 00:46:41.880
<v Speaker 1>you got to call them at home if the </v>
<v Speaker 1>phone didn't pick up,</v>

986
00:46:41.881 --> 00:46:42.630
<v Speaker 1>they didn't have an answer.</v>

987
00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:45.060
<v Speaker 1>Machine couldn't even leave a message.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was weird back then.</v>

988
00:46:45.061 --> 00:46:46.260
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

989
00:46:46.261 --> 00:46:51.261
<v Speaker 1>I hooked up with this chick that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>always thought I've thought about for </v>

990
00:46:51.261 --> 00:46:51.261
<v Speaker 1>years after,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like whatever happened to that girl,</v>

991
00:46:51.261 --> 00:46:53.930
<v Speaker 1>she was a bank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh fuck.</v>

992
00:46:53.940 --> 00:46:56.550
<v Speaker 1>And she was in the weightlifting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

993
00:46:56.551 --> 00:47:00.150
<v Speaker 1>seriously in a weightlifting and she had</v>
<v Speaker 1>a full on six pack.</v>

994
00:47:00.330 --> 00:47:01.680
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got a full six pack.</v>

995
00:47:01.681 --> 00:47:06.681
<v Speaker 1>She was like frank and she had these big</v>
<v Speaker 1>ass fucking squatter legs and she was a </v>

996
00:47:08.610 --> 00:47:11.220
<v Speaker 1>freak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I always remember like,</v>

997
00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:12.710
<v Speaker 1>God damn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like whatever happened,</v>

998
00:47:12.730 --> 00:47:14.580
<v Speaker 1>that crazy girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was fun.</v>

999
00:47:14.850 --> 00:47:16.890
<v Speaker 1>You didn't look her up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't find her and if she's too big</v>

1000
00:47:16.891 --> 00:47:18.390
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man made me nervous.</v>

1001
00:47:18.870 --> 00:47:21.270
<v Speaker 1>She made me nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not kidding.</v>

1002
00:47:21.390 --> 00:47:24.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean she was real nice and she lived </v>
<v Speaker 1>like really far away to a thing.</v>

1003
00:47:24.871 --> 00:47:26.400
<v Speaker 1>She was like an hour and a half away </v>
<v Speaker 1>from me.</v>

1004
00:47:26.460 --> 00:47:27.470
<v Speaker 1>An hour and a half drive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

1005
00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:32.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those don't work out when you're 20 and </v>

1006
00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:32.480
<v Speaker 1>you're</v>

1007
00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:33.430
<v Speaker 4>busy with a million other things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But she was a tank.</v>

1008
00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:38.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been with a couple of girls that </v>

1009
00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:40.271
<v Speaker 3>were in mma to mma girls type girls' </v>
<v Speaker 3>bodies and it's not comfortable and </v>

1010
00:47:41.060 --> 00:47:41.660
<v Speaker 3>thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1011
00:47:41.661 --> 00:47:45.710
<v Speaker 3>this girl can kill me if I didn't like </v>
<v Speaker 3>having sex with them was weird.</v>

1012
00:47:45.740 --> 00:47:47.690
<v Speaker 3>It was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I'm fucking a guy.</v>

1013
00:47:47.850 --> 00:47:50.120
<v Speaker 4>We did a fica pen and the other day and </v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1014
00:47:50.180 --> 00:47:55.180
<v Speaker 4>Eddie Bravo was drunk off his rocker and</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were all having fun and talking about</v>

1015
00:47:56.031 --> 00:47:58.490
<v Speaker 4>whether or not female UFC fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what,</v>

1016
00:47:58.820 --> 00:48:02.300
<v Speaker 4>what untrained male could fuck up a </v>
<v Speaker 4>female UFC fighter.</v>

1017
00:48:02.301 --> 00:48:05.480
<v Speaker 4>Like how big does the woman have to be?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How big is the man?</v>

1018
00:48:05.481 --> 00:48:07.820
<v Speaker 4>I got to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We got the Cyborg versus Ray Lewis.</v>

1019
00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:12.920
<v Speaker 4>It was one of the most ridiculous </v>
<v Speaker 4>conversations we've ever had.</v>

1020
00:48:13.370 --> 00:48:18.370
<v Speaker 4>And he got to the point where he was </v>
<v Speaker 4>using like social justice warrior </v>

1021
00:48:18.370 --> 00:48:21.461
<v Speaker 4>tactics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said that we all hated women and he </v>

1022
00:48:22.350 --> 00:48:25.110
<v Speaker 4>was insisting that a good day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1023
00:48:25.190 --> 00:48:27.830
<v Speaker 4>he wanted to have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's a bad ass fighter.</v>

1024
00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:29.900
<v Speaker 4>But she also fights 100,</v>
<v Speaker 4>15 pounds.</v>

1025
00:48:30.110 --> 00:48:32.790
<v Speaker 4>Like how big would the man have to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>for like a,</v>

1026
00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:36.000
<v Speaker 4>we're thinking like a 190 pounds </v>
<v Speaker 4>untrained man I'm on.</v>

1027
00:48:36.020 --> 00:48:37.070
<v Speaker 4>And then we've got to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1028
00:48:37.071 --> 00:48:42.071
<v Speaker 4>well what's untrained?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What if he has a year of high school </v>

1029
00:48:42.071 --> 00:48:42.071
<v Speaker 4>wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have a year of high school wrestling.</v>

1030
00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:44.960
<v Speaker 4>That's the guy who understands how to </v>
<v Speaker 4>take people down at the very least.</v>

1031
00:48:44.990 --> 00:48:46.970
<v Speaker 4>And if he gets on top of you in 190 </v>
<v Speaker 4>pounds a year,</v>

1032
00:48:46.971 --> 00:48:48.920
<v Speaker 4>1:15</v>
<v Speaker 4>you might be Foxville.</v>

1033
00:48:48.980 --> 00:48:53.980
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so then we got into this crazy </v>

1034
00:48:53.980 --> 00:48:53.980
<v Speaker 4>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then it got to blink.</v>

1035
00:48:53.980 --> 00:48:55.880
<v Speaker 4>Seibold will fuck up any untrained dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What about Ray Lewis?</v>

1036
00:48:55.970 --> 00:48:56.660
<v Speaker 4>And then it got site.</v>

1037
00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:03.530
<v Speaker 4>So inside his twitter page,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ray Lewis,</v>

1038
00:49:03.531 --> 00:49:05.810
<v Speaker 4>249 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It says Chris Cyborg,</v>

1039
00:49:05.811 --> 00:49:08.840
<v Speaker 4>1:39.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is a fucking lie.</v>

1040
00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:11.600
<v Speaker 4>Cris Cyborg.</v>
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>

1041
00:49:12.500 --> 00:49:17.500
<v Speaker 4>I think they should make a 145 pound </v>
<v Speaker 4>weight class just for her because the </v>

1042
00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:21.371
<v Speaker 4>UFC right now has to 115 and 135 </v>
<v Speaker 4>recognized classes and the women's </v>

1043
00:49:23.181 --> 00:49:25.640
<v Speaker 4>division and they had sideboard get down</v>
<v Speaker 4>to 1:40</v>

1044
00:49:25.850 --> 00:49:29.630
<v Speaker 4>for one fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She fought a Leslie Smith at 1:40,</v>

1045
00:49:29.631 --> 00:49:32.180
<v Speaker 4>so that's more realistic that she weighs</v>
<v Speaker 4>1:45,</v>

1046
00:49:32.510 --> 00:49:35.180
<v Speaker 4>but you really only weighs 1:45</v>
<v Speaker 4>after a brutal weight cut.</v>

1047
00:49:35.181 --> 00:49:38.100
<v Speaker 4>She's probably closer to one 65 five.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1048
00:49:38.450 --> 00:49:43.450
<v Speaker 4>in real life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they keep making it get down to </v>

1049
00:49:43.450 --> 00:49:43.450
<v Speaker 4>1:40,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I don't.</v>

1050
00:49:43.450 --> 00:49:47.110
<v Speaker 4>I don't fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not like she's not going to fight </v>

1051
00:49:47.110 --> 00:49:47.110
<v Speaker 4>at 1:35.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's too big,</v>

1052
00:49:47.110 --> 00:49:49.850
<v Speaker 4>but there's a video of her making weight</v>
<v Speaker 4>for 1:40</v>

1053
00:49:49.851 --> 00:49:52.700
<v Speaker 4>that she just put up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's horrific,</v>

1054
00:49:52.701 --> 00:49:53.750
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's crying.</v>

1055
00:49:54.120 --> 00:49:59.120
<v Speaker 4>She's like broken down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean they get so fucking drained and </v>

1056
00:49:59.661 --> 00:50:01.340
<v Speaker 4>then they got to fight 24 hours later.</v>

1057
00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:04.160
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The whole process is crazy.</v>

1058
00:50:04.460 --> 00:50:07.820
<v Speaker 4>It's dangerous and it's stupid and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>unnecessary.</v>

1059
00:50:08.330 --> 00:50:13.330
<v Speaker 4>You should let these athletes like they </v>
<v Speaker 4>should figure out what I think the real </v>

1060
00:50:13.941 --> 00:50:15.290
<v Speaker 4>problem is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's one of the problems.</v>

1061
00:50:15.291 --> 00:50:17.960
<v Speaker 4>Is there a specific weight classes?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1062
00:50:18.290 --> 00:50:20.940
<v Speaker 4>There's like 1:55.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's 1:17</v>

1063
00:50:20.980 --> 00:50:24.980
<v Speaker 4>is one of 85 and in each specific weight</v>
<v Speaker 4>class the guy has.</v>

1064
00:50:25.940 --> 00:50:27.230
<v Speaker 4>There's a champion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1065
00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:28.790
<v Speaker 4>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1066
00:50:28.810 --> 00:50:33.080
<v Speaker 4>the variety of people like what your </v>
<v Speaker 4>natural weight should be,</v>

1067
00:50:33.950 --> 00:50:38.950
<v Speaker 4>it's really should be what you are when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're healthy in shape and you're </v>

1068
00:50:38.950 --> 00:50:41.060
<v Speaker 4>walking around and ideally that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly where you should be fighting.</v>

1069
00:50:41.570 --> 00:50:45.320
<v Speaker 4>The problem is people are going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking game the system and I think what</v>

1070
00:50:45.321 --> 00:50:49.070
<v Speaker 4>we have to do is we have to shame people</v>
<v Speaker 4>that try to gain the system.</v>

1071
00:50:49.370 --> 00:50:52.940
<v Speaker 4>People that try to dehydrate themselves </v>
<v Speaker 4>and fight smaller people.</v>

1072
00:50:52.970 --> 00:50:56.540
<v Speaker 4>That's like contrary to everything that </v>
<v Speaker 4>martial arts is supposed to be about.</v>

1073
00:50:56.870 --> 00:51:01.870
<v Speaker 4>You're supposed to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's supposed to be about testing your </v>

1074
00:51:01.870 --> 00:51:04.511
<v Speaker 4>skills and especially in the competition</v>
<v Speaker 4>sense versus someone who the exact same </v>

1075
00:51:04.511 --> 00:51:05.810
<v Speaker 4>size as you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you're testing your skills,</v>

1076
00:51:05.930 --> 00:51:09.710
<v Speaker 4>you're testing your ability against </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone who is the same size as you,</v>

1077
00:51:09.860 --> 00:51:14.860
<v Speaker 4>but if you pretend that you're that size</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you only that size for like an hour </v>

1078
00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:18.550
<v Speaker 4>because you dehydrate yourself but then </v>
<v Speaker 4>you below up and you're much bigger </v>

1079
00:51:18.550 --> 00:51:23.021
<v Speaker 4>after it's over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's sort of contrary to what martial </v>

1080
00:51:23.021 --> 00:51:23.090
<v Speaker 4>arts is supposed to be about.</v>

1081
00:51:23.140 --> 00:51:27.070
<v Speaker 3>Do you think it's the frequency of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>UFC is how many there are?</v>

1082
00:51:27.100 --> 00:51:29.920
<v Speaker 3>How many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you mean they're flooding the UFC?</v>

1083
00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:32.830
<v Speaker 3>There's one almost every two weeks now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think if they were like,</v>

1084
00:51:32.860 --> 00:51:34.600
<v Speaker 3>you're only allowed to fight every three</v>
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>

1085
00:51:34.601 --> 00:51:39.601
<v Speaker 3>but we're paying you twice as much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you think that would help out a </v>

1086
00:51:39.601 --> 00:51:39.601
<v Speaker 3>fighters?</v>

1087
00:51:39.601 --> 00:51:40.280
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that's the solution.</v>

1088
00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:43.280
<v Speaker 4>I think it's good to have a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 4>different suggestions,</v>

1089
00:51:43.850 --> 00:51:45.860
<v Speaker 4>but I think what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right now,</v>

1090
00:51:45.861 --> 00:51:49.220
<v Speaker 4>everyone's locked into these pathways of</v>
<v Speaker 4>fighting for titles.</v>

1091
00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:52.130
<v Speaker 4>This is what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's awesome.</v>

1092
00:51:52.520 --> 00:51:54.470
<v Speaker 4>Don't get me wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love when someone wins the belt.</v>

1093
00:51:54.710 --> 00:51:56.390
<v Speaker 4>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's exciting.</v>

1094
00:51:56.630 --> 00:52:01.630
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I get to walk up to someone and </v>

1095
00:52:01.630 --> 00:52:03.971
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tyron Woodley the new welterweight </v>

1096
00:52:03.971 --> 00:52:03.971
<v Speaker 4>champion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the world.</v>

1097
00:52:03.971 --> 00:52:04.640
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how does that sound like?</v>

1098
00:52:04.641 --> 00:52:09.641
<v Speaker 4>That's real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You get to participate in one of the </v>

1099
00:52:09.641 --> 00:52:11.630
<v Speaker 4>most special moments of an athlete's </v>
<v Speaker 4>career.</v>

1100
00:52:12.170 --> 00:52:17.170
<v Speaker 4>Have a fighter's entire struggle as a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a competitor in one of the most </v>

1101
00:52:18.021 --> 00:52:21.650
<v Speaker 4>difficult things a person could ever do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that moment is like,</v>

1102
00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:23.150
<v Speaker 4>that's a crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>critical,</v>

1103
00:52:23.151 --> 00:52:26.270
<v Speaker 4>huge,</v>
<v Speaker 4>massive moment for anyone.</v>

1104
00:52:26.930 --> 00:52:29.600
<v Speaker 4>I remember clearly saying that to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Should tate.</v>

1105
00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:31.630
<v Speaker 4>I remember clearly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sandra Day O'connor,</v>

1106
00:52:31.631 --> 00:52:33.530
<v Speaker 4>Mcgregor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tyron Woodley,</v>

1107
00:52:34.250 --> 00:52:35.750
<v Speaker 4>Robbie Lawler,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember it clearly.</v>

1108
00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:37.580
<v Speaker 4>A lot of these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a huge,</v>

1109
00:52:37.581 --> 00:52:42.581
<v Speaker 4>huge moments.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't think the average person and even </v>

1110
00:52:42.581 --> 00:52:42.581
<v Speaker 4>me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think,</v>

1111
00:52:42.581 --> 00:52:46.841
<v Speaker 4>I mean as close as I am to the struggle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the fights and calling them all and </v>

1112
00:52:47.421 --> 00:52:52.421
<v Speaker 4>being there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I understand it like he </v>

1113
00:52:52.421 --> 00:52:52.421
<v Speaker 4>understands it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no way I can't.</v>

1114
00:52:52.421 --> 00:52:53.540
<v Speaker 4>There's no way I do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just don't.</v>

1115
00:52:56.390 --> 00:53:00.410
<v Speaker 4>So there's that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But after that,</v>

1116
00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:04.460
<v Speaker 4>what do we really want to see?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We want to see the best people fight the</v>

1117
00:53:04.461 --> 00:53:09.461
<v Speaker 4>best people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if the title of champion is</v>

1118
00:53:09.711 --> 00:53:12.890
<v Speaker 4>the best way to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1119
00:53:12.891 --> 00:53:15.080
<v Speaker 4>we all are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're all obsessed with WHO's the best.</v>

1120
00:53:15.081 --> 00:53:17.720
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that is a good thing I guess because</v>

1121
00:53:17.721 --> 00:53:22.721
<v Speaker 4>it forces people to fucking just </v>
<v Speaker 4>polished that sword to the perfect </v>

1122
00:53:23.181 --> 00:53:24.980
<v Speaker 4>sharpness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But at the end of the day,</v>

1123
00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:27.030
<v Speaker 4>do we want to see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We want to see the best people fight the</v>

1124
00:53:27.031 --> 00:53:28.620
<v Speaker 4>best people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what we really want to say.</v>

1125
00:53:28.700 --> 00:53:33.700
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I say dia is double slap connor in the </v>

1126
00:53:33.700 --> 00:53:33.700
<v Speaker 4>face at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1127
00:53:33.700 --> 00:53:33.700
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

1128
00:53:33.700 --> 00:53:37.440
<v Speaker 4>let me ask you this right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If somebody had to offer you a paper </v>

1129
00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:41.400
<v Speaker 4>review tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if there's a paper review they were </v>

1130
00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:41.400
<v Speaker 4>doing tomorrow and it's Nick Diaz versus</v>
<v Speaker 4>George St Pierre.</v>

1131
00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:42.030
<v Speaker 4>There's no title on the line.</v>

1132
00:53:42.210 --> 00:53:45.270
<v Speaker 4>Who gives a fuck about a title?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't care at all.</v>

1133
00:53:45.450 --> 00:53:50.450
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't care less about a title if </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's George St Pierre Versus Nick Diaz.</v>

1134
00:53:51.010 --> 00:53:52.680
<v Speaker 4>I'm in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm in.</v>

1135
00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:53.330
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1136
00:53:53.350 --> 00:53:55.920
<v Speaker 4>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's the same thing with tyron</v>

1137
00:53:55.921 --> 00:54:00.921
<v Speaker 4>woodley versus Nick Diaz or Tyron </v>
<v Speaker 4>Woodley versus George St Pierre.</v>

1138
00:54:01.890 --> 00:54:04.830
<v Speaker 4>Like it doesn't have to be for a title </v>
<v Speaker 4>like I want to see that.</v>

1139
00:54:04.890 --> 00:54:09.890
<v Speaker 4>I want to see what that is and I mean </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's amazing when a person wins the </v>

1140
00:54:09.890 --> 00:54:12.150
<v Speaker 4>title,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is a gigantic achievement,</v>

1141
00:54:12.690 --> 00:54:16.140
<v Speaker 4>but what do you really want to see as </v>
<v Speaker 4>an.</v>

1142
00:54:16.500 --> 00:54:21.500
<v Speaker 4>As a person who enjoys the sport,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want to see a guy who was beating </v>

1143
00:54:21.500 --> 00:54:21.500
<v Speaker 4>everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1144
00:54:21.500 --> 00:54:22.770
<v Speaker 4>You want to see a guy who just keeps </v>
<v Speaker 4>beating.</v>

1145
00:54:22.771 --> 00:54:27.771
<v Speaker 4>Guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't matter if there's a belt on </v>

1146
00:54:27.771 --> 00:54:29.871
<v Speaker 4>the line.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I find out that Robbie lawler's one </v>

1147
00:54:29.871 --> 00:54:30.270
<v Speaker 4>six fights in a row against world class </v>
<v Speaker 4>competition,</v>

1148
00:54:30.271 --> 00:54:31.530
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's beaten this guy.</v>

1149
00:54:31.530 --> 00:54:33.390
<v Speaker 4>He's beaten that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's beaten Matt Brown.</v>

1150
00:54:33.391 --> 00:54:35.790
<v Speaker 4>He's beaten Johny Hendricks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>

1151
00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:38.760
<v Speaker 4>The belt doesn't mean a thing to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It really doesn't.</v>

1152
00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:42.510
<v Speaker 4>I just want to see Ken Robbie lawler </v>
<v Speaker 4>beat Tyron Woodley,</v>

1153
00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:45.210
<v Speaker 4>Tyron Woodley Beats Robbie lawler.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I start thinking,</v>

1154
00:54:45.211 --> 00:54:48.330
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can tyron Woodley beat George St Pierre.</v>

1155
00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:50.640
<v Speaker 4>Can you see George St Pierre Ready to </v>
<v Speaker 4>come back?</v>

1156
00:54:50.670 --> 00:54:53.490
<v Speaker 4>If he is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can tyron Woodley beat him or can George</v>

1157
00:54:53.500 --> 00:54:58.470
<v Speaker 4>fighter really smart fight all law the </v>
<v Speaker 4>way Rory Mcdonald did and Rory Macdonald</v>

1158
00:54:58.590 --> 00:55:03.590
<v Speaker 4>shut down a lot of tyrone's offense in </v>
<v Speaker 4>their fight and won a decision or is </v>

1159
00:55:03.751 --> 00:55:05.910
<v Speaker 4>tyron better than he was that I want to </v>
<v Speaker 4>see that.</v>

1160
00:55:05.940 --> 00:55:09.060
<v Speaker 4>Is he better?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to see is is he's super confident</v>

1161
00:55:09.061 --> 00:55:14.061
<v Speaker 4>now that he won the title is he just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is he going to take them to some whole </v>

1162
00:55:14.061 --> 00:55:14.660
<v Speaker 4>new level?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got.</v>

1163
00:55:14.670 --> 00:55:19.670
<v Speaker 4>You beat a guy like Robbie lawler.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You knock them out and in one round </v>

1164
00:55:19.670 --> 00:55:19.670
<v Speaker 4>you've got to think the momentum coming </v>
<v Speaker 4>off of that.</v>

1165
00:55:19.670 --> 00:55:20.400
<v Speaker 4>It's got to be stunning.</v>

1166
00:55:22.170 --> 00:55:27.170
<v Speaker 3>I would love to see fantasy UFC like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>show where they take maybe the fighters </v>

1167
00:55:27.170 --> 00:55:29.050
<v Speaker 3>that have retired or people that aren't </v>
<v Speaker 3>as good as the other fires and have them</v>

1168
00:55:29.060 --> 00:55:30.980
<v Speaker 3>like almost do like game shows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff like this.</v>

1169
00:55:31.010 --> 00:55:32.420
<v Speaker 3>Like you have to do a game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go.</v>

1170
00:55:32.450 --> 00:55:34.190
<v Speaker 3>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this fight you have your shoes tied,</v>

1171
00:55:34.191 --> 00:55:36.050
<v Speaker 3>you have to hold a banana and not crush </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1172
00:55:36.051 --> 00:55:37.970
<v Speaker 3>You have to protect this banana.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's a baby,</v>

1173
00:55:38.280 --> 00:55:40.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like fun things like that,</v>

1174
00:55:40.790 --> 00:55:42.840
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you're saying.</v>

1175
00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:47.010
<v Speaker 3>But because I think even as I think as a</v>
<v Speaker 3>fight it would still be fun just to have</v>

1176
00:55:47.390 --> 00:55:49.160
<v Speaker 3>other options.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like almost like a video game,</v>

1177
00:55:49.190 --> 00:55:51.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where your doctor.</v>

1178
00:55:51.540 --> 00:55:55.050
<v Speaker 3>I've told you many times something wrong</v>
<v Speaker 3>with his brain and we need competition.</v>

1179
00:55:55.051 --> 00:55:56.370
<v Speaker 3>Still have some kind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's,</v>

1180
00:55:57.050 --> 00:55:59.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fight is still a competition,</v>

1181
00:55:59.031 --> 00:56:04.031
<v Speaker 3>but if you take away the belt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you still maybe want to have like a </v>

1182
00:56:04.031 --> 00:56:04.280
<v Speaker 3>tournament a month,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not monthly,</v>

1183
00:56:04.281 --> 00:56:07.250
<v Speaker 3>but maybe a quarterly tournament or a </v>
<v Speaker 3>second season of some kind.</v>

1184
00:56:07.251 --> 00:56:09.010
<v Speaker 3>So there's something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you ever see,</v>

1185
00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:11.000
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>showtime did</v>

1186
00:56:11.370 --> 00:56:13.410
<v Speaker 4>in boxing with the middleweight </v>
<v Speaker 4>division,</v>

1187
00:56:14.910 --> 00:56:15.730
<v Speaker 4>that whole,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1188
00:56:16.110 --> 00:56:21.110
<v Speaker 4>series of a series of events a few years</v>
<v Speaker 4>back with Carl fraud and bunch of other,</v>

1189
00:56:21.901 --> 00:56:23.800
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Andre Ward was in it,</v>

1190
00:56:23.840 --> 00:56:25.330
<v Speaker 4>a super six,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that what it is?</v>

1191
00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:31.920
<v Speaker 4>Super Six world boxing classic and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>was super middleweight and they got the </v>

1192
00:56:31.931 --> 00:56:36.931
<v Speaker 4>best super middleweights in the world </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they paired them off against each </v>

1193
00:56:36.931 --> 00:56:40.351
<v Speaker 4>other and this long running series where</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're all committed to fighting each </v>

1194
00:56:40.351 --> 00:56:41.470
<v Speaker 4>other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was really interesting,</v>

1195
00:56:42.010 --> 00:56:43.840
<v Speaker 4>really interesting as an idea,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1196
00:56:43.870 --> 00:56:48.870
<v Speaker 4>as a combat sport idea and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you think about like what that could </v>

1197
00:56:48.870 --> 00:56:49.570
<v Speaker 4>mean for the future.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1198
00:56:49.630 --> 00:56:53.320
<v Speaker 4>I think something like that for mma,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mixed martial arts would be gigantic and</v>

1199
00:56:53.321 --> 00:56:58.321
<v Speaker 4>it could generate a lot of interest and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it could be something where they put up </v>

1200
00:56:58.321 --> 00:56:59.050
<v Speaker 4>a ton of money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like instead of a world title,</v>

1201
00:56:59.560 --> 00:57:01.900
<v Speaker 4>like what have they had an invitational.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What if they,</v>

1202
00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:06.960
<v Speaker 4>someone put together an invitation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they made a deal with the UFC and they </v>

1203
00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:07.090
<v Speaker 4>made a deal with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1204
00:57:07.091 --> 00:57:11.320
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one fc or whatever the organizations are</v>

1205
00:57:11.321 --> 00:57:16.321
<v Speaker 4>that are valid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you have a tournament where they're </v>

1206
00:57:16.321 --> 00:57:20.251
<v Speaker 4>all going to duke it out and there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to be some sort of split of </v>

1207
00:57:20.251 --> 00:57:23.611
<v Speaker 4>revenue of the paper view of this one </v>
<v Speaker 4>tournament and you'll have this super </v>

1208
00:57:23.681 --> 00:57:26.020
<v Speaker 4>six type thing like they did with </v>
<v Speaker 4>showtime with boxing.</v>

1209
00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:27.310
<v Speaker 4>Be Insane,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1210
00:57:27.910 --> 00:57:28.750
<v Speaker 4>That'd be epic.</v>

1211
00:57:29.720 --> 00:57:33.200
<v Speaker 7>Isn't fighting for that revenue also?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Maybe good or is that bad?</v>

1212
00:57:33.201 --> 00:57:36.260
<v Speaker 7>Because you could have extra problems </v>
<v Speaker 7>with that.</v>

1213
00:57:36.261 --> 00:57:39.000
<v Speaker 7>Maybe with people taking dives or </v>
<v Speaker 7>backend deals.</v>

1214
00:57:39.001 --> 00:57:39.830
<v Speaker 7>There's whatnot.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>

1215
00:57:39.890 --> 00:57:41.210
<v Speaker 7>I don't know how problems come in with </v>
<v Speaker 7>that,</v>

1216
00:57:41.211 --> 00:57:41.390
<v Speaker 7>but</v>

1217
00:57:41.490 --> 00:57:43.620
<v Speaker 4>the real money and fighting is always in</v>
<v Speaker 4>winning.</v>

1218
00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:47.730
<v Speaker 4>So like getting people to throw fights.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Boy,</v>

1219
00:57:47.731 --> 00:57:52.731
<v Speaker 4>that's unusual.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so unusual in a high end fighting </v>

1220
00:57:52.731 --> 00:57:55.530
<v Speaker 4>because when a fighter loses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not just about losing that fight.</v>

1221
00:57:55.560 --> 00:58:00.560
<v Speaker 4>It's also about they lost their last </v>
<v Speaker 4>fight so then they're coming into their </v>

1222
00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:03.711
<v Speaker 4>next fight as a loser.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they're getting less money so people </v>

1223
00:58:03.711 --> 00:58:04.860
<v Speaker 4>don't like them as much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

1224
00:58:05.100 --> 00:58:10.100
<v Speaker 4>if somebody hits you and you just fall </v>
<v Speaker 4>down and pretend that you got knocked </v>

1225
00:58:10.100 --> 00:58:10.100
<v Speaker 4>out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't do that.</v>

1226
00:58:10.100 --> 00:58:12.780
<v Speaker 4>And you can make money like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Somebody could bet you or promise you,</v>

1227
00:58:12.781 --> 00:58:13.830
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Someone could say,</v>

1228
00:58:14.110 --> 00:58:16.440
<v Speaker 4>I'm betting 300 grand and you go down </v>
<v Speaker 4>the first round,</v>

1229
00:58:16.470 --> 00:58:17.810
<v Speaker 4>I'll give you a $100,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>for.</v>

1230
00:58:17.830 --> 00:58:21.210
<v Speaker 4>I know you're only getting paid 20 grand</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so you do that.</v>

1231
00:58:21.211 --> 00:58:24.420
<v Speaker 4>And some dude that has totally been done</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the world of boxing.</v>

1232
00:58:24.450 --> 00:58:29.450
<v Speaker 4>It's definitely happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure it's probably happened in the </v>

1233
00:58:29.450 --> 00:58:29.450
<v Speaker 4>UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not aware of it happening,</v>

1234
00:58:29.450 --> 00:58:32.430
<v Speaker 4>but there's always the potential for </v>
<v Speaker 4>people being deceptive</v>

1235
00:58:32.990 --> 00:58:35.660
<v Speaker 7>happened in every sport.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm pretty sure at some point or another</v>

1236
00:58:35.990 --> 00:58:36.680
<v Speaker 7>at one time.</v>

1237
00:58:36.830 --> 00:58:39.380
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't an NBA referee scandal.</v>

1238
00:58:39.460 --> 00:58:40.030
<v Speaker 7>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1239
00:58:40.031 --> 00:58:41.650
<v Speaker 7>Tim,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Donna Hay,</v>

1240
00:58:41.651 --> 00:58:46.651
<v Speaker 7>I believe he lied and he went to jail </v>
<v Speaker 7>for it too and he was betting he was </v>

1241
00:58:46.651 --> 00:58:48.610
<v Speaker 7>making bets on things that he knew from </v>
<v Speaker 7>insight information,</v>

1242
00:58:48.611 --> 00:58:53.611
<v Speaker 7>whether it's like this particular </v>
<v Speaker 7>referee calls really bad against this </v>

1243
00:58:53.771 --> 00:58:58.771
<v Speaker 7>team because maybe he doesn't like </v>
<v Speaker 7>someone on the team or something like </v>

1244
00:58:58.771 --> 00:58:58.771
<v Speaker 7>that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They're not supposed to do that,</v>

1245
00:58:58.771 --> 00:58:59.020
<v Speaker 7>but he was calling out information </v>
<v Speaker 7>publicly.</v>

1246
00:58:59.021 --> 00:59:01.870
<v Speaker 7>I think he wrote a book about it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>All the referees also then said,</v>

1247
00:59:01.871 --> 00:59:03.430
<v Speaker 7>he's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He's an asshole.</v>

1248
00:59:03.700 --> 00:59:05.560
<v Speaker 7>He's obviously a scumbag,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he went to jail,</v>

1249
00:59:05.860 --> 00:59:10.860
<v Speaker 7>but when you look at the track records </v>
<v Speaker 7>of some of these things that he was </v>

1250
00:59:10.860 --> 00:59:13.621
<v Speaker 7>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it looks to say that there is some way </v>

1251
00:59:13.621 --> 00:59:13.621
<v Speaker 7>that there isn't a little bit of water </v>
<v Speaker 7>there,</v>

1252
00:59:13.621 --> 00:59:14.810
<v Speaker 7>that he's something so whether or not</v>

1253
00:59:18.370 --> 00:59:22.130
<v Speaker 4>try to get that statement of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I like to like where people</v>

1254
00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:23.060
<v Speaker 7>were talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh yeah.</v>

1255
00:59:23.190 --> 00:59:28.190
<v Speaker 7>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that fucking little bit of water in </v>

1256
00:59:28.190 --> 00:59:28.190
<v Speaker 7>there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Huh?</v>

1257
00:59:28.190 --> 00:59:28.420
<v Speaker 7>That statement holds water is what I was</v>
<v Speaker 7>trying to say.</v>

1258
00:59:29.090 --> 00:59:32.230
<v Speaker 7>So he might've got framed,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know about framed,</v>

1259
00:59:32.231 --> 00:59:33.100
<v Speaker 7>but they might.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He,</v>

1260
00:59:33.190 --> 00:59:37.350
<v Speaker 7>he definitely got caught and what he was</v>
<v Speaker 7>doing and I think it was betting store,</v>

1261
00:59:37.370 --> 00:59:39.060
<v Speaker 7>like maybe what Pete rose did.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

1262
00:59:39.530 --> 00:59:44.530
<v Speaker 7>But then he wrote a book afterwards </v>
<v Speaker 7>talking about all this stuff you knew </v>

1263
00:59:44.530 --> 00:59:45.760
<v Speaker 7>and all this scumbag shit other referees</v>
<v Speaker 7>were doing.</v>

1264
00:59:45.761 --> 00:59:47.630
<v Speaker 7>I'll take your name or anything like </v>
<v Speaker 7>that,</v>

1265
00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:52.010
<v Speaker 7>but somebody wanted to talk to him and </v>
<v Speaker 7>see if what other things he knows.</v>

1266
00:59:53.570 --> 00:59:54.320
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>

1267
00:59:54.350 --> 00:59:56.720
<v Speaker 7>I would imagine if you have something </v>
<v Speaker 7>where people bet on it,</v>

1268
00:59:57.260 --> 01:00:00.650
<v Speaker 7>like professional sports or even college</v>
<v Speaker 7>sports,</v>

1269
01:00:01.580 --> 01:00:06.580
<v Speaker 7>I would imagine there's so many people </v>
<v Speaker 7>that bet on those games that there's </v>

1270
01:00:06.580 --> 01:00:07.190
<v Speaker 7>always going to be like low lives.</v>

1271
01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:11.300
<v Speaker 7>Like I know friends who use actual real </v>
<v Speaker 7>old school bookies.</v>

1272
01:00:12.020 --> 01:00:12.950
<v Speaker 7>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

1273
01:00:12.951 --> 01:00:14.260

<v Speaker 7>They use real bookies.</v>

1274
01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:15.680
<v Speaker 7>Bookies still exists.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Tim,</v>

1275
01:00:15.770 --> 01:00:20.770
<v Speaker 7>Donna Hay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>100 percent of NBA referees gamble when </v>

1276
01:00:20.810 --> 01:00:22.460
<v Speaker 7>weird stuff was happening this year in </v>
<v Speaker 7>the NBA.</v>

1277
01:00:22.461 --> 01:00:24.230
<v Speaker 7>People always like to say that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

1278
01:00:24.860 --> 01:00:29.000
<v Speaker 7>they are setting things up for money and</v>
<v Speaker 7>ratings and whatnot.</v>

1279
01:00:29.001 --> 01:00:34.001
<v Speaker 7>And they'll go to wherever he wants to </v>
<v Speaker 7>write an article will go to him and get </v>

1280
01:00:34.001 --> 01:00:35.150
<v Speaker 7>a quote from him saying this thing was </v>
<v Speaker 7>fixed or this thing was staged.</v>

1281
01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:39.190
<v Speaker 7>And it's unprovable usually,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but he'll say it right.</v>

1282
01:00:39.510 --> 01:00:42.320
<v Speaker 7>Should hire amish people or something.</v>
<v Speaker 7>People,</v>

1283
01:00:42.321 --> 01:00:44.990
<v Speaker 7>they definitely don't care or have tvs.</v>

1288
01:00:53.930 --> 01:00:58.110
<v Speaker 4>You should be able to gamble on whatever</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fuck you want all over town.</v>

1289
01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:03.320

<v Speaker 4>one gambling should be taxed and that's </v>

1309
01:02:08.151 --> 01:02:08.151
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't blame gambling.</v>

<v Speaker 7>You can claim losses too.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Which is how some gamblers get through </v>

<v Speaker 7>I think throughout a year.</v>

1316
01:02:22.841 --> 01:02:22.860

01:04:44.310 --> 01:04:49.310
<v Speaker 4>but they just fucking animals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were living like savages and they </v>

1370
01:04:49.310 --> 01:04:49.310
<v Speaker 4>weren't paying the taxes and they one by</v>
<v Speaker 4>one.</v>

1371
01:04:49.310 --> 01:04:54.231
<v Speaker 4>They all got fucking thunderstruck and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a worst case scenario because it </v>

1372
01:04:54.841 --> 01:04:55.860
<v Speaker 4>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's the comedy.</v>

1373
01:04:55.861 --> 01:04:56.640
<v Speaker 4>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

1374
01:04:56.970 --> 01:05:01.970
<v Speaker 4>here's like the eighties comedy boom </v>
<v Speaker 4>where everybody's got rolled up sleeves </v>

1375
01:05:01.970 --> 01:05:02.960
<v Speaker 4>on fucking blazer and standing onstage.</v>

1376
01:05:03.060 --> 01:05:05.310
<v Speaker 4>Did she ever notice and that everybody's</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing that,</v>

1377
01:05:05.390 --> 01:05:06.360
<v Speaker 4>they're all killing it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1378
01:05:06.390 --> 01:05:08.490
<v Speaker 4>They're all over the evening at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Improv.</v>

1379
01:05:08.670 --> 01:05:12.240
<v Speaker 4>Can't get enough talent because there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>just not enough comedians.</v>

1380
01:05:12.250 --> 01:05:13.680
<v Speaker 4>They just need.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They need more.</v>

1381
01:05:13.681 --> 01:05:15.870
<v Speaker 4>They'll shows a huge people love,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like sitting in front of the TV,</v>

1382
01:05:15.871 --> 01:05:17.830
<v Speaker 4>like vege not watched an evening at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Improv.</v>

1383
01:05:18.210 --> 01:05:21.010
<v Speaker 4>So these comedy clubs explode all across</v>
<v Speaker 4>the country.</v>

1384
01:05:21.011 --> 01:05:26.011
<v Speaker 4>I mean fucking explode.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But as Joey as likes to say that </v>

1385
01:05:26.011 --> 01:05:28.720
<v Speaker 4>couldn't cover the spread,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they couldn't cover the spread.</v>

1386
01:05:28.721 --> 01:05:33.721
<v Speaker 4>Joe Rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People get tired of seeing the same </v>

1387
01:05:33.721 --> 01:05:35.290
<v Speaker 4>fucking act over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going out,</v>

1388
01:05:35.291 --> 01:05:38.830
<v Speaker 4>you're buying a fucking babysitter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's what happened.</v>

1389
01:05:38.890 --> 01:05:43.890
<v Speaker 4>It died off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So these guys made all their money in </v>

1390
01:05:43.890 --> 01:05:45.200
<v Speaker 4>the hay day and during the day they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>young blown.</v>

1391
01:05:45.201 --> 01:05:50.201
<v Speaker 4>I bugged him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Da da Da da every night killing.</v>

1392
01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:54.520
<v Speaker 4>And I told her,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not my fucking Dick.</v>

1393
01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:58.480
<v Speaker 4>The whole place goes crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The world goes nuts.</v>

1394
01:05:58.481 --> 01:06:03.481
<v Speaker 4>They'd fucking clink glasses at the bar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>After awhile they got a Mr Johnson.</v>

1395
01:06:06.770 --> 01:06:09.630
<v Speaker 4>It's Mr Peterson from the irs would love</v>
<v Speaker 4>to have a word with you.</v>

1396
01:06:10.020 --> 01:06:15.020
<v Speaker 4>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then they just go over the fact that</v>

1397
01:06:15.481 --> 01:06:20.481
<v Speaker 4>they audited the comedy club and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>comedy club has all these comics on </v>

1398
01:06:20.481 --> 01:06:22.620
<v Speaker 4>roster,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you are amongst them.</v>

1399
01:06:22.621 --> 01:06:25.860
<v Speaker 4>You made x amount of dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we got paid zero.</v>

1400
01:06:26.130 --> 01:06:29.720
<v Speaker 4>You owe as this plus a penalty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is that and you just.</v>

1401
01:06:31.210 --> 01:06:36.210
<v Speaker 4>And the common cause of dried up and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're getting older and a lot of tired</v>

1402
01:06:36.341 --> 01:06:41.341
<v Speaker 4>that drinking and partying all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get worn out and then all of a </v>

1403
01:06:41.341 --> 01:06:41.470
<v Speaker 4>sudden there's no more work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The work dies off.</v>

1404
01:06:42.230 --> 01:06:44.950
<v Speaker 4>You haven't really done the road so you </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't have a national presence,</v>

1405
01:06:44.951 --> 01:06:49.951
<v Speaker 4>you only have a local presence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then the fucking money guys come in </v>

1406
01:06:49.951 --> 01:06:54.461
<v Speaker 4>and suck it out yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'm just going to hook the strap to </v>

1407
01:06:54.461 --> 01:06:55.410
<v Speaker 4>your spine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pull the fluid out.</v>

1408
01:06:56.670 --> 01:06:57.960
<v Speaker 4>I recently had to go through</v>

1409
01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:00.360
<v Speaker 3>all my stuff too for the irs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was.</v>

1410
01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:05.900
<v Speaker 3>Nowadays it's a lot better though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess than it used to be because if </v>

1411
01:07:05.900 --> 01:07:05.900
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say a comedian,</v>

1412
01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:07.480
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go through and you just go like,</v>

1413
01:07:07.510 --> 01:07:08.440
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>comedy store.</v>

1414
01:07:08.530 --> 01:07:10.060
<v Speaker 3>I was at the comedy store,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a comedian,</v>

1415
01:07:10.390 --> 01:07:15.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I go to the comedy store almost </v>

1416
01:07:15.390 --> 01:07:15.400
<v Speaker 3>every single day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you also realize that everything you</v>

1417
01:07:15.401 --> 01:07:20.401
<v Speaker 3>do as a comic like that I could write </v>
<v Speaker 3>off because the parking next door I can </v>

1418
01:07:20.771 --> 01:07:25.771
<v Speaker 3>ride off if I even get Netflix,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could write that off because I'm </v>

1419
01:07:25.771 --> 01:07:27.070
<v Speaker 3>researching Netflix,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1420
01:07:27.071 --> 01:07:32.071
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's pretty amazing like how much </v>

1421
01:07:32.071 --> 01:07:34.770
<v Speaker 3>you know you can write off and how much </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's documented nowadays because </v>

1422
01:07:34.770 --> 01:07:35.830
<v Speaker 3>everyone's using their cards instead of </v>
<v Speaker 3>paying cash for it.</v>

1423
01:07:35.980 --> 01:07:37.120
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>

1424
01:07:37.350 --> 01:07:39.250
<v Speaker 3>it's gotten better for comics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

1425
01:07:39.251 --> 01:07:41.050
<v Speaker 3>you know now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

1426
01:07:41.051 --> 01:07:46.051
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>back then I couldn't even imagine just </v>

1427
01:07:46.051 --> 01:07:46.051
<v Speaker 3>having all those receipts and just being</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1428
01:07:46.051 --> 01:07:46.051
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I swear this was for her,</v>

1429
01:07:46.051 --> 01:07:46.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>comedy,</v>

1430
01:07:46.690 --> 01:07:48.730
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of screwy because if you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>like a writer,</v>

1431
01:07:48.731 --> 01:07:53.731
<v Speaker 4>you can do that to have your writer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can say that you're doing research </v>

1432
01:07:53.731 --> 01:07:53.731
<v Speaker 4>and you go to the movies</v>

1433
01:07:53.731 --> 01:07:53.731
<v Speaker 8>[inaudible]</v>

1434
01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:56.700
<v Speaker 4>I don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1435
01:07:56.980 --> 01:08:01.980
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is something screwy about it </v>

1436
01:08:01.980 --> 01:08:01.980
<v Speaker 4>because like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1437
01:08:01.980 --> 01:08:02.660
<v Speaker 4>I guess you could write it off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess it's research,</v>

1438
01:08:02.661 --> 01:08:04.400
<v Speaker 4>but really you're just having fun at the</v>
<v Speaker 4>movies,</v>

1439
01:08:04.401 --> 01:08:05.960
<v Speaker 4>aren't you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know</v>

1440
01:08:06.230 --> 01:08:06.690
<v Speaker 8>[inaudible].</v>

1441
01:08:07.810 --> 01:08:10.600
<v Speaker 3>I have this business lunches though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you've ever been on tons</v>

1442
01:08:10.601 --> 01:08:15.601
<v Speaker 3>of advice to work in restaurants where </v>
<v Speaker 3>people would come in and would use </v>

1443
01:08:15.601 --> 01:08:16.250
<v Speaker 3>friendship out of those credit and </v>
<v Speaker 3>quarter stakes</v>

1444
01:08:16.250 --> 01:08:18.920
<v Speaker 7>for 15 guys are sitting there drinking </v>
<v Speaker 7>whiskey at lunch.</v>

1445
01:08:19.770 --> 01:08:21.430
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but not talk about business.</v>

1446
01:08:21.780 --> 01:08:26.470
<v Speaker 4>This business in the sense like say like</v>
<v Speaker 4>a Brian and I had a business opportunity</v>

1447
01:08:26.471 --> 01:08:28.330
<v Speaker 4>for you and we want you to get excited </v>
<v Speaker 4>about it,</v>

01:08:28.331 --> 01:08:30.370
<v Speaker 4>so we're going to take you out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to get you drunk,</v>

1449
01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:35.560
<v Speaker 4>going to buy some steaks and we're going</v>
<v Speaker 4>to sit there and clink glasses together </v>

1450
01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:39.301
<v Speaker 4>and will feel a little loose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll have some comradery because of </v>

1451
01:08:39.301 --> 01:08:42.121
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Booze will be feeling good and we'll go </v>

1452
01:08:42.121 --> 01:08:42.121
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like this venture.</v>

1453
01:08:42.121 --> 01:08:45.751
<v Speaker 4>I think this could be really successful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we're going to work well </v>

1454
01:08:45.751 --> 01:08:48.031
<v Speaker 4>together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I have a good fucking diamond </v>

1455
01:08:48.031 --> 01:08:48.031
<v Speaker 4>click,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a real business</v>

1456
01:08:48.031 --> 01:08:51.940
<v Speaker 7>100 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but like in a wolf of Wall Street where </v>

1457
01:08:51.940 --> 01:08:54.581
<v Speaker 7>they're sitting there in this data is </v>
<v Speaker 7>looking through all their money they </v>

1458
01:08:54.581 --> 01:08:54.581
<v Speaker 7>spent on hookers and whatnot.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You really had to spend $78,000</v>

1459
01:08:54.581 --> 01:08:55.840
<v Speaker 7>on data,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but like you could,</v>

1460
01:08:55.860 --> 01:09:00.170
<v Speaker 7>we could have had lunch at Mcdonald's or</v>
<v Speaker 7>subway instead of having it at,</v>

1461
01:09:00.530 --> 01:09:03.920
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like the ivy or coy or whatever,</v>

1462
01:09:03.921 --> 01:09:06.230
<v Speaker 7>and Sushi.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We could've just got food.</v>

1463
01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:09.870
<v Speaker 7>Why did you have to spend $500?</v>
<v Speaker 7>You could have spent 100 right while you</v>

1464
01:09:09.871 --> 01:09:14.871
<v Speaker 7>guys had to have all the crazy steaks </v>
<v Speaker 7>and $500 bottles of wine to talk about </v>

1465
01:09:14.871 --> 01:09:16.460
<v Speaker 7>this meal.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's the same kind of thought.</v>

1466
01:09:16.461 --> 01:09:18.800
<v Speaker 7>Like what kind of fucking logic is that </v>
<v Speaker 7>pussy.</v>

1467
01:09:18.860 --> 01:09:23.270
<v Speaker 7>I'm just saying.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm crazy.</v>

1468
01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:25.180
<v Speaker 7>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's been.</v>

1469
01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:30.240
<v Speaker 7>It's been done plenty of times.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've had friends that make their living </v>

1470
01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:30.240
<v Speaker 7>off of,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're not going to impress me,</v>

1471
01:09:30.260 --> 01:09:30.730
<v Speaker 7>but Jamie,</v>

1472
01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:34.190
<v Speaker 4>what you're saying is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're talking about some big,</v>

1473
01:09:34.260 --> 01:09:36.900
<v Speaker 4>big business on a budget.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We could have gone to Mcdonald's</v>

1474
01:09:37.180 --> 01:09:39.600
<v Speaker 7>supersized.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm just sort of making it,</v>

1475
01:09:39.601 --> 01:09:44.601
<v Speaker 7>but like if you were going to spend $500</v>
<v Speaker 7>on the client when you can spend five,</v>

1476
01:09:44.671 --> 01:09:47.730
<v Speaker 7>well then don't spend any money on your </v>
<v Speaker 7>research to make your job better.</v>

1477
01:09:47.731 --> 01:09:52.731
<v Speaker 7>Like just watch,</v>
<v Speaker 7>watch people at the park instead of </v>

1478
01:09:52.731 --> 01:09:53.250
<v Speaker 7>paying 10 bucks to get better quality </v>
<v Speaker 7>research.</v>

1479
01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:58.280
<v Speaker 7>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's all I'm sure that's to watch </v>

1480
01:09:58.280 --> 01:09:58.280
<v Speaker 7>people at the park.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's free.</v>

1481
01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:01.800
<v Speaker 7>It's free entertainment and taking in a </v>
<v Speaker 7>movie I was making.</v>

1482
01:10:01.801 --> 01:10:03.220
<v Speaker 7>They look like a comics.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Good.</v>

1483
01:10:04.070 --> 01:10:04.560
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no.</v>

1484
01:10:04.561 --> 01:10:08.280
<v Speaker 7>I'm just saying as a comic looking for </v>
<v Speaker 7>material you have.</v>

1485
01:10:08.730 --> 01:10:11.790
<v Speaker 7>If you're going to make the argument of </v>
<v Speaker 7>saying I need to get material,</v>

1486
01:10:11.791 --> 01:10:13.470
<v Speaker 7>this is what I'm going to do to get my </v>
<v Speaker 7>material.</v>

1487
01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:16.470
<v Speaker 7>It could be anything you want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You could talk about basketball.</v>

1488
01:10:16.471 --> 01:10:20.160
<v Speaker 7>You could talk about poker to a strip </v>
<v Speaker 7>club joke in your at a park.</v>

1489
01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:22.410
<v Speaker 7>Trying to think of strip clubs yet.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's what I'm saying.</v>

1490
01:10:22.411 --> 01:10:25.050
<v Speaker 7>If you want to talk about strip clubs,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you have to go to a strip club.</v>

1491
01:10:25.110 --> 01:10:29.520
<v Speaker 7>So at this business guy making this big </v>
<v Speaker 7>deal deal at d at lunch.</v>

1492
01:10:29.540 --> 01:10:31.500
<v Speaker 7>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I have to go to this lunch and I have to</v>

1493
01:10:31.501 --> 01:10:34.170
<v Speaker 7>spend this money because to try to </v>
<v Speaker 7>impress my clients,</v>

1494
01:10:34.171 --> 01:10:35.370
<v Speaker 7>they can't impress,</v>
<v Speaker 7>not Mcdonald's.</v>

1495
01:10:35.371 --> 01:10:40.371
<v Speaker 7>There's just.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You can make the arguments if you want </v>

1496
01:10:40.371 --> 01:10:40.920
<v Speaker 7>all day long for the thing that is </v>
<v Speaker 7>needed for your business.</v>

1497
01:10:40.950 --> 01:10:45.950
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's the only thing I was trying to </v>

1498
01:10:45.950 --> 01:10:45.950
<v Speaker 7>say.</v>

1499
01:10:45.950 --> 01:10:47.900
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you mean from the employer's point of </v>

1500
01:10:47.900 --> 01:10:49.941
<v Speaker 4>view of allowing this to happen or from </v>
<v Speaker 4>the person who's the salesperson needs </v>

1501
01:10:49.941 --> 01:10:53.000
<v Speaker 4>to defend this action.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I suppose it's,</v>

1502
01:10:53.490 --> 01:10:54.240
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1503
01:10:54.260 --> 01:10:59.260
<v Speaker 4>I could see both arguments,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but honestly I think for a lot of the </v>

1504
01:10:59.260 --> 01:11:02.571
<v Speaker 4>people that have those accounts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it's kind of important that they </v>

1505
01:11:02.571 --> 01:11:05.721
<v Speaker 4>formed these relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why business launch is actually </v>

1506
01:11:05.721 --> 01:11:08.601
<v Speaker 4>an effective thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I would think that a business lunch </v>

1507
01:11:08.601 --> 01:11:08.601
<v Speaker 4>is one of the rare exceptions of </v>
<v Speaker 4>something that makes fun,</v>

1508
01:11:08.601 --> 01:11:11.040
<v Speaker 4>that you write off or make sense rather </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you write off.</v>

1509
01:11:11.430 --> 01:11:14.700
<v Speaker 4>But I could see that movies make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1510
01:11:14.701 --> 01:11:17.690
<v Speaker 4>like if you're a guy and you're a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're writing,</v>

1511
01:11:17.790 --> 01:11:20.880
<v Speaker 4>you're a writer and you're writing a </v>
<v Speaker 4>piece about modern horror movies,</v>

1512
01:11:20.881 --> 01:11:23.730
<v Speaker 4>about the lack of modern horror movies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if you're a modern,</v>

1513
01:11:23.790 --> 01:11:26.760
<v Speaker 4>if you're a fan of horror movies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck.</v>

1514
01:11:26.761 --> 01:11:31.761
<v Speaker 4>You have to wait a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How long do you have to wait for a good </v>

1515
01:11:31.761 --> 01:11:33.750
<v Speaker 4>goddamn vampire movie?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hold on for a werewolf movie,</v>

1516
01:11:33.751 --> 01:11:36.570
<v Speaker 4>it's every 30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>God Damn it.</v>

1517
01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:42.320
<v Speaker 4>Every now and then they tease you like </v>
<v Speaker 4>bleeding the ecl del Toro and that were </v>

1518
01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:42.320
<v Speaker 4>on the call,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's Atari.</v>

1519
01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:44.370
<v Speaker 4>He's not going to fuck it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is going to be amazing.</v>

1520
01:11:44.810 --> 01:11:49.020
<v Speaker 4>They fucked up Benito del Toro and </v>
<v Speaker 4>Anthony Hopkins and it's still blue.</v>

1521
01:11:49.790 --> 01:11:51.060
<v Speaker 4>Nicholas?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1522
01:11:51.061 --> 01:11:56.061
<v Speaker 4>That was the worst with Michelle </v>
<v Speaker 4>pfeiffer when she was so hot.</v>

1523
01:11:59.830 --> 01:12:02.120
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you every watched deliverance </v>
<v Speaker 3>the other day.</v>

1524
01:12:02.121 --> 01:12:04.640
<v Speaker 3>That's a horror movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't stop thinking about that.</v>

1525
01:12:04.670 --> 01:12:05.970
<v Speaker 3>Squeal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a pig seen.</v>

1526
01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:08.150
<v Speaker 3>Ugh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What a creepy,</v>

1527
01:12:08.151 --> 01:12:12.170
<v Speaker 3>realistic version of parts of life that </v>
<v Speaker 3>goes on every single day.</v>

1528
01:12:12.171 --> 01:12:13.460
<v Speaker 3>Probably,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably.</v>

1529
01:12:13.470 --> 01:12:14.270
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was a</v>

1530
01:12:14.270 --> 01:12:16.640
<v Speaker 4>crazy ass movie man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that Jack Nicholson?</v>

1531
01:12:17.410 --> 01:12:21.320
<v Speaker 4>That is so dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why is his forehead have zero hair?</v>

1532
01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:22.480
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's.</v>

1533
01:12:23.460 --> 01:12:25.640
<v Speaker 4>And when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when he turns into a wolf man,</v>

1534
01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:27.410
<v Speaker 4>there is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's the same size.</v>

1535
01:12:27.411 --> 01:12:28.220
<v Speaker 4>Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1536
01:12:28.221 --> 01:12:30.770

<v Speaker 4>That's not,</v>

1538
01:12:32.300 --> 01:12:33.020
<v Speaker 4>that's not him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1539
01:12:33.050 --> 01:12:34.750
<v Speaker 4>That's not Jack Nicholson.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I am.</v>

1540
01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:36.490
<v Speaker 4>Is that a different one or is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>another.</v>

1541
01:12:36.491 --> 01:12:40.880
<v Speaker 4>A scene in the movie like CGI,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Michelle Pfeiffer.</v>

1542
01:12:40.881 --> 01:12:44.640
<v Speaker 4>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who is that Jack made within?</v>

1543
01:12:44.650 --> 01:12:45.380
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1544
01:12:45.381 --> 01:12:50.381
<v Speaker 4>that's what he looked like at the end.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there was like stages of Werewolf </v>

1545
01:12:50.381 --> 01:12:51.590
<v Speaker 4>dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Remember this movie?</v>

1546
01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:54.170
<v Speaker 4>This is eyes for something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1547
01:12:54.171 --> 01:12:59.171
<v Speaker 4>this is different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Find out if there's a scene where you </v>

1548
01:12:59.171 --> 01:12:59.780
<v Speaker 4>see what Jack Nicholson looked like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was called Wolf.</v>

1549
01:13:00.410 --> 01:13:03.260
<v Speaker 4>It was really corny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They like jumped in slow motion.</v>

1550
01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:07.310
<v Speaker 4>Like whenever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you're showing slow motion.</v>

1551
01:13:07.311 --> 01:13:08.300
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you fucked up.</v>

1552
01:13:08.540 --> 01:13:11.990
<v Speaker 4>Horror movies should be about two </v>
<v Speaker 4>seconds scenes like,</v>

1553
01:13:12.020 --> 01:13:14.780
<v Speaker 4>like alien,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the first movie alien was perfect.</v>

1554
01:13:14.781 --> 01:13:19.781
<v Speaker 4>You rarely get to see the alien and when</v>
<v Speaker 4>you did see it it was like when he was a</v>

1555
01:13:21.470 --> 01:13:24.560
<v Speaker 4>perfect movie in that sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you see in Jack Nicholson,</v>

1556
01:13:24.561 --> 01:13:28.100
<v Speaker 4>who looks exactly like Jack Nicholson </v>
<v Speaker 4>with a thicker beard,</v>

1557
01:13:28.430 --> 01:13:32.720
<v Speaker 4>he looks like a Jack Nicholson.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That would be a Barista in a handcrafted</v>

1558
01:13:32.721 --> 01:13:35.570
<v Speaker 4>coffee place in Seattle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how fucking furry.</v>

1559
01:13:35.571 --> 01:13:37.880
<v Speaker 4>He is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Always get slightly bigger teeth,</v>

1560
01:13:37.881 --> 01:13:41.510
<v Speaker 4>which by the way you can buy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just like you can buy dental implants,</v>

1561
01:13:41.690 --> 01:13:46.690
<v Speaker 4>you can buy those slightly bigger teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you essentially could look fucking </v>

1562
01:13:46.690 --> 01:13:48.830
<v Speaker 4>exactly like Jack Nicholson in this </v>
<v Speaker 4>stupid wolf movie.</v>

1563
01:13:49.100 --> 01:13:54.100
<v Speaker 4>You could get some fake eyes where you </v>
<v Speaker 4>put contacts on that make you look </v>

1564
01:13:54.100 --> 01:13:55.010
<v Speaker 4>scary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

1565
01:13:55.011 --> 01:13:59.180
<v Speaker 4>so he's jumping in slow motion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And as each jumping in slow motion,</v>

1566
01:13:59.181 --> 01:14:02.150
<v Speaker 4>you realize like that's just like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>person's body and something,</v>

1567
01:14:02.151 --> 01:14:05.600
<v Speaker 4>even though it's not even weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just a guy like this,</v>

1568
01:14:06.740 --> 01:14:11.740
<v Speaker 4>these peanut here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Remember this movie he peed on James </v>

1569
01:14:11.740 --> 01:14:12.130
<v Speaker 4>Spader never.</v>
<v Speaker 4>James before he was in this</v>

1570
01:14:12.130 --> 01:14:16.280
<v Speaker 1>new fucking bullshit show isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

1571
01:14:16.860 --> 01:14:18.310
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't look like James Spader at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

1572
01:14:18.340 --> 01:14:19.100
<v Speaker 1>Was it super?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>

1573
01:14:19.110 --> 01:14:22.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying he's way too young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess this old thing go spader.</v>

1574
01:14:23.850 --> 01:14:25.210
<v Speaker 1>That's 1984,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1575
01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:27.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm not disagreeing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying is it 84 and 94?</v>

1576
01:14:27.620 --> 01:14:28.720
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen 94.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

<v Speaker 1>looks like because it was really bad.</v>

1579
01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:40.680
<v Speaker 1>I wish I was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish I was like friends with the </v>

<v Speaker 1>trailers.</v>

<v Speaker 10>She was psyched.</v>

1619
01:16:58.600 --> 01:17:02.260
<v Speaker 10>The blood lust of a savage beast though.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Both.</v>

1620
01:17:02.261 --> 01:17:02.980
<v Speaker 10>Man.</v>

1621
01:17:03.300 --> 01:17:06.510
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if that's a real trailer of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fan created.</v>

1622
01:17:06.950 --> 01:17:08.940
<v Speaker 1>It looks like a real trailer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does,</v>

1623
01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:11.360
<v Speaker 1>but I think they had trailers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did they have?</v>

1624
01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:13.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen 41.</v>

1625
01:17:13.461 --> 01:17:14.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had trailers back then.</v>

1626
01:17:14.451 --> 01:17:15.740
<v Speaker 1>Did that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1627
01:17:15.770 --> 01:17:17.030
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh wow.</v>

1628
01:17:17.090 --> 01:17:19.820
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think they did man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that for some movies,</v>

1629
01:17:19.821 --> 01:17:21.820
<v Speaker 1>like when you go to itunes and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1630
01:17:22.070 --> 01:17:24.770
<v Speaker 1>you go to click on trailer for some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like really shitty movies.</v>

1631
01:17:24.771 --> 01:17:27.290
<v Speaker 1>They don't really have a trailer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They Just take a chunk of the movie,</v>

1632
01:17:27.291 --> 01:17:30.500
<v Speaker 1>like stick it in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gives a fucking piece of shit movie.</v>

1633
01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:33.820
<v Speaker 1>I did that the other day with some </v>
<v Speaker 1>horror movie and I tried to watch it and</v>

1634
01:17:33.821 --> 01:17:35.130
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me see what the trailer is.</v>

1635
01:17:35.300 --> 01:17:38.810
<v Speaker 1>The traiLer wasn't a trailer at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just like they just took a snip.</v>

1636
01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:40.400
<v Speaker 1>What do you want?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like four minutes.</v>

1637
01:17:40.460 --> 01:17:42.140
<v Speaker 1>how long you want the trailer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Five minutes.</v>

1638
01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:46.580
<v Speaker 1>Not five minutes in particular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a good five titty.</v>

1639
01:17:48.110 --> 01:17:49.640
<v Speaker 1>If I did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't put that in there.</v>

1640
01:17:49.940 --> 01:17:52.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's a super common thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that.</v>

1641
01:17:52.730 --> 01:17:54.650
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what year they invented the </v>
<v Speaker 1>trailer.</v>

1642
01:17:54.860 --> 01:17:56.570
<v Speaker 1>Have you had to guess?</v>
<v Speaker 1>40 six,</v>

1643
01:17:57.110 --> 01:17:58.610
<v Speaker 1>46.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's 41.</v>

1644
01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:02.420
<v Speaker 1>30 six.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He six.</v>

1645
01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:05.480
<v Speaker 1>It certainly looks like a real trailer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like those fonts.</v>

1646
01:18:05.481 --> 01:18:07.580
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But how bad is the acting?</v>

1647
01:18:08.780 --> 01:18:09.380
<v Speaker 1>Even with them?</v>

1648
01:18:09.380 --> 01:18:14.380
<v Speaker 7>Murderer.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's bad acting and movies that I </v>

1649
01:18:14.380 --> 01:18:14.380
<v Speaker 7>thought were amazing 10 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 7>First</v>

1650
01:18:14.380 --> 01:18:19.160
<v Speaker 1>shown us fiLm theater in 1913.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

1651
01:18:19.261 --> 01:18:22.080
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1652
01:18:23.370 --> 01:18:26.460
<v Speaker 1>And we've been fucked ever since then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>advertising should be illegal,</v>

1653
01:18:26.461 --> 01:18:31.180
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still easy.</v>

1654
01:18:31.181 --> 01:18:34.290
<v Speaker 1>It'll fuck with our heads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like trailers more than I like movies.</v>

1655
01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:36.870
<v Speaker 1>How about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's a fucking juicy,</v>

1656
01:18:37.270 --> 01:18:39.920
<v Speaker 1>Like they figured out how to make it </v>
<v Speaker 1>into little sound bite.</v>

1657
01:18:41.390 --> 01:18:46.390
<v Speaker 7>That's what happened with suicide squad.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Apparently they made that cool trailer </v>

1658
01:18:46.390 --> 01:18:48.240
<v Speaker 7>that came out earlier last year and </v>
<v Speaker 7>everyone really liked that.</v>

1659
01:18:48.241 --> 01:18:51.110
<v Speaker 7>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the war on warner brotherS company lists</v>

1660
01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:56.120
<v Speaker 7>what I read,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they were afraid it wasn't going to be </v>

1661
01:18:56.120 --> 01:18:56.120
<v Speaker 7>that cool.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I wasn't going to look like that.</v>

1662
01:18:56.120 --> 01:19:00.301
<v Speaker 7>It wasn't going to deliver on that </v>
<v Speaker 7>promise when they're also freaked out </v>

1663
01:19:00.301 --> 01:19:02.631
<v Speaker 7>because of batman and superman that had </v>
<v Speaker 7>failed so hard that they hired that </v>

1664
01:19:02.631 --> 01:19:05.961
<v Speaker 7>company that made that trailer to re </v>
<v Speaker 7>edit the movie that the director was </v>

1665
01:19:05.961 --> 01:19:05.961
<v Speaker 7>making at the same time they were making</v>
<v Speaker 7>it,</v>

1666
01:19:05.961 --> 01:19:10.761
<v Speaker 7>so there's two cuts going around the </v>
<v Speaker 7>same time and then they molded them </v>

1667
01:19:10.761 --> 01:19:12.780
<v Speaker 7>together at the end of the summer.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Too many cooks too much come.</v>

1668
01:19:12.890 --> 01:19:16.230
<v Speaker 7>They too much in the egg drop soup.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They actually added jokes.</v>

1669
01:19:16.290 --> 01:19:19.170
<v Speaker 7>They had to reshoot a lot of stuff to </v>
<v Speaker 7>add more humor to it.</v>

1670
01:19:19.171 --> 01:19:24.171
<v Speaker 7>They ended it out the joker completely,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but all you know is that the director's </v>

1671
01:19:24.171 --> 01:19:27.740
<v Speaker 7>cuts probably.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They edited out the joker with jared </v>

1672
01:19:27.740 --> 01:19:28.500
<v Speaker 7>leto.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They edited a lot of the joker up.</v>

1673
01:19:28.501 --> 01:19:30.510
<v Speaker 7>Most of the joker.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He's barely in that movie.</v>

1674
01:19:30.511 --> 01:19:32.070
<v Speaker 7>I really.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I refuse to watch.</v>

1675
01:19:32.071 --> 01:19:32.880
<v Speaker 7>You heard.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

1676
01:19:32.881 --> 01:19:33.450
<v Speaker 7>no.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I read it.</v>

1677
01:19:33.451 --> 01:19:34.230
<v Speaker 7>I ride him.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He read</v>

1678
01:19:34.300 --> 01:19:37.290
<v Speaker 1>so true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He complained about it to.</v>

1679
01:19:37.650 --> 01:19:39.400

<v Speaker 1>Did you notice that he's not even in the</v>

<v Speaker 1>well?</v>

1682
01:19:45.070 --> 01:19:48.490

01:22:14.350 --> 01:22:17.260
<v Speaker 7>And there's also probably a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 7>bullshit stories that are put into the,</v>

1739
01:22:17.261 --> 01:22:22.120
<v Speaker 7>into the tmzs just so you have some </v>
<v Speaker 7>prior advertising of a movie that no one</v>

1743
01:22:28.240 --> 01:22:29.680
<v Speaker 7>you can say that they're doing it on </v>
<v Speaker 7>purpose.</v>

<v Speaker 7>for the longest time I don't trust.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't.</v>

1751
01:22:41.050 --> 01:22:43.930
<v Speaker 7>I used to think rotten tomatoes was </v>
<v Speaker 7>completely legit.</v>

1752
01:22:43.931 --> 01:22:48.931
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>but then you start seeing movies on </v>

01:22:48.931 --> 01:22:48.931
<v Speaker 7>rotten tomatoes and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I saw that movie.</v>

1754
01:22:48.931 --> 01:22:49.120

01:22:49.121 --> 01:22:51.220
<v Speaker 7>How in the fuck is that?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Ninety eight percent.</v>

1756
01:22:51.460 --> 01:22:55.550

<v Speaker 5>way.</v>

1797
01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:48.720
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And separated through critics and then </v>

1798
01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:51.121
<v Speaker 5>use the reviews and there's been like a </v>
<v Speaker 5>separate icon that you're supposed to </v>

1799
01:24:51.121 --> 01:24:52.540
<v Speaker 5>pay attention.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was just gO to the app.</v>

1800
01:24:53.100 --> 01:24:58.100
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then if you scroll down now if you </v>

1801
01:24:58.100 --> 01:24:58.100
<v Speaker 5>scroll down,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have lights.</v>

1802
01:24:58.100 --> 01:25:00.920
<v Speaker 5>Actually yelp go to the yelp app.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I'm good at rotten tomatoes was even</v>

1803
01:25:00.940 --> 01:25:02.370
<v Speaker 5>have an app.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do they make that up?</v>

1804
01:25:02.500 --> 01:25:03.130
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they did.</v>

1805
01:25:04.450 --> 01:25:07.510
<v Speaker 5>But then they have like the reverse.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then a lot of these reviewers,</v>

1806
01:25:07.660 --> 01:25:10.420
<v Speaker 5>there's somebody that actually chooses </v>
<v Speaker 5>if it's rotten or not.</v>

1807
01:25:10.421 --> 01:25:12.040
<v Speaker 5>I clicked on a few of these,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1808
01:25:12.220 --> 01:25:17.220
<v Speaker 5>like what they're called fresh reviews </v>
<v Speaker 5>where it's supposed to be positive </v>

1809
01:25:17.220 --> 01:25:18.340
<v Speaker 5>review and then they go through it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're like,</v>

1810
01:25:18.580 --> 01:25:23.580
<v Speaker 5>how did they get positive from this?</v>
<v Speaker 5>This sounds like they were kind of on </v>

1811
01:25:23.580 --> 01:25:23.580
<v Speaker 5>the fence,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a 50 slash 50 percent,</v>

1812
01:25:23.580 --> 01:25:25.210
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But then it's like all,</v>

1813
01:25:25.240 --> 01:25:28.990
<v Speaker 5>none of it makes real sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no real math on this at all.</v>

1814
01:25:29.020 --> 01:25:34.020
<v Speaker 5>It's it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's pretty bullshit because there's </v>

1815
01:25:34.020 --> 01:25:34.330
<v Speaker 5>been a few interesting that you Just </v>
<v Speaker 5>pointed that out.</v>

1816
01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:36.820
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's interestinG that that's critics.</v>

1817
01:25:36.930 --> 01:25:41.930
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really thought that the whole purpose </v>

1818
01:25:41.930 --> 01:25:42.130
<v Speaker 5>of those things was reviewers being </v>
<v Speaker 5>regular peopLe.</v>

1819
01:25:42.300 --> 01:25:47.300
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you look at it like a site like </v>

1820
01:25:47.300 --> 01:25:48.871
<v Speaker 5>metacritic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that seems like it's a little bit less </v>

1821
01:25:48.871 --> 01:25:51.751
<v Speaker 5>bias and a more faCtual and that makes </v>
<v Speaker 5>more sense because there's been so many </v>

1822
01:25:51.911 --> 01:25:53.380
<v Speaker 5>movies on your lately.</v>

<v Speaker 5>percent.</v>

1824
01:25:55.991 --> 01:25:56.770
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because you could,</v>

1825
01:25:56.800 --> 01:25:59.230
<v Speaker 5>if you had a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could just use these guys.</v>

1826
01:25:59.231 --> 01:26:01.590
<v Speaker 5>Take them to business.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Lunch plank length,</v>

<v Speaker 5>look at this now.</v>

1832
01:26:22.401 --> 01:26:27.401
<v Speaker 5>If you go to this one and look at the </v>
<v Speaker 5>same movies like sausage party or </v>

1833
01:26:27.401 --> 01:26:27.830
<v Speaker 5>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it won't match up.</v>

1834
01:26:27.920 --> 01:26:32.920
<v Speaker 5>Shouldn't they match up?</v>
<v Speaker 5>If they both do the exact same fucking </v>

1835
01:26:32.920 --> 01:26:32.920
<v Speaker 5>thing in their own farm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the same company.</v>

1836
01:26:32.920 --> 01:26:34.100
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I hate life.</v>

1837
01:26:34.150 --> 01:26:36.860
<v Speaker 5>That owned by the same company.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of them is owned by cbs.</v>

1838
01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:39.200
<v Speaker 5>The other one is owned by universal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1839
01:26:39.860 --> 01:26:44.860
<v Speaker 5>But yet notice how many.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How many reviewers on this one compared </v>

1840
01:26:44.860 --> 01:26:47.651
<v Speaker 5>to how many reviewers on the one that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>universal with sony universal work </v>

1841
01:26:47.651 --> 01:26:47.651
<v Speaker 5>together if not owned by the same </v>
<v Speaker 5>company.</v>

1842
01:26:47.651 --> 01:26:48.710
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How many different.</v>

1843
01:26:48.740 --> 01:26:51.140
<v Speaker 5>What is the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Was the numbers for metacritic?</v>

1844
01:26:51.630 --> 01:26:54.630
<v Speaker 4>Seventy four versus would've met a </v>
<v Speaker 4>critical</v>

1845
01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:02.010
<v Speaker 5>less.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1846
01:27:02.011 --> 01:27:03.900
<v Speaker 5>This is for critic reviews.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have 27,</v>

1847
01:27:03.901 --> 01:27:04.400
<v Speaker 5>six,</v>
<v Speaker 5>30,</v>

1848
01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:06.490
<v Speaker 5>34 or so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just 34.</v>

1849
01:27:08.340 --> 01:27:10.890
<v Speaker 5>So my folks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we had to get medicated.</v>

1850
01:27:11.100 --> 01:27:16.100
<v Speaker 5>So metacritic is not the same pool as </v>
<v Speaker 5>rotten tomatoes where all these extra </v>

1851
01:27:17.710 --> 01:27:20.960

<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cool.</v>

1871

<v Speaker 4>but I would imagine a company like </v>
<v Speaker 4>rotten tomatoes,</v>

1874
01:28:06.481 --> 01:28:10.230
<v Speaker 4>which you've used,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've used so many people have used to to</v>

1875
01:28:10.260 --> 01:28:13.040
<v Speaker 4>see a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They probably makes a cash,</v>

<v Speaker 6>I'll tell you the tell you the</v>

1975
01:31:54.520 --> 01:31:59.520
<v Speaker 3>full truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been waiting for this movie for a </v>

1976
01:31:59.520 --> 01:31:59.520
<v Speaker 3>long ass time because it's kind of like </v>
<v Speaker 3>a dream movie,</v>

1977
01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:01.990
<v Speaker 3>a pixar movie and having a dirty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like an old fritz,</v>

1978
01:32:01.991 --> 01:32:03.210
<v Speaker 3>the cat or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1979
01:32:03.460 --> 01:32:05.320
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a couple of scenes in there that</v>

1980
01:32:05.530 --> 01:32:06.790
<v Speaker 3>kind of our fun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

1981
01:32:06.791 --> 01:32:09.070
<v Speaker 3>very fun to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But overall it just,</v>

1982
01:32:09.280 --> 01:32:12.610
<v Speaker 3>it was just like having a kids movie </v>
<v Speaker 3>where they cussed at and it was like,</v>

1983
01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:14.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really kind of like,</v>

1984
01:32:14.680 --> 01:32:16.180
<v Speaker 3>oh god,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh jeez.</v>

1985
01:32:16.210 --> 01:32:17.770
<v Speaker 3>Oh my.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got bored.</v>

1986
01:32:17.860 --> 01:32:22.860
<v Speaker 3>That was the biggest thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just got really bored while watching </v>

1987
01:32:22.860 --> 01:32:25.381
<v Speaker 3>it and I was not expecting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was expecting that to be the best way </v>

1988
01:32:25.381 --> 01:32:25.381
<v Speaker 3>to get tattoo of it on my arm or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>

1989
01:32:25.381 --> 01:32:25.960
<v Speaker 3>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

1990
01:32:26.170 --> 01:32:29.920
<v Speaker 3>it was one of the biggest letdowns I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever had and the rotten tomatoes,</v>

1991
01:32:29.950 --> 01:32:34.950
<v Speaker 3>that's called reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Internet's coming for your son and I </v>

1992
01:32:34.950 --> 01:32:35.070
<v Speaker 3>love seth rogen movies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's my favorites.</v>

1993
01:32:35.140 --> 01:32:37.820
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if there was a Class of movie,</v>

1994
01:32:37.821 --> 01:32:39.700
<v Speaker 3>if seth rogen movies are my top </v>
<v Speaker 3>favorite,</v>

1995
01:32:39.701 --> 01:32:44.701
<v Speaker 3>but it just didn't like it was cheesy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they called the juice juice and </v>

1996

<v Speaker 3>I really,</v>

2001
01:32:55.340 --> 01:32:57.350
<v Speaker 3>maybe I was just a little bit of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>correction.</v>

2002
01:32:57.640 --> 01:33:00.470
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I waS just in the mood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will definitely watch it again and see</v>

2003
01:33:00.471 --> 01:33:05.471
<v Speaker 3>if it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seemed like a kids movie where they </v>

2004
01:33:05.471 --> 01:33:07.631
<v Speaker 3>cussed and it's pretty much like if I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to do the first or like a new </v>

2005

<v Speaker 6>Don't say anymore.</v>

2024

01:33:59.440 --> 01:34:01.060
<v Speaker 6>You know what man?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's.</v>

2030
01:34:06.490 --> 01:34:07.990

<v Speaker 6>Did you?</v>

2031
01:34:08.050 --> 01:34:08.610
<v Speaker 6>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I did.</v>

2032
01:34:08.680 --> 01:34:10.060
<v Speaker 6>God,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my girls want to see it.</v>

2033
01:34:10.061 --> 01:34:15.061
<v Speaker 6>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's perfect movie for her year old </v>

2034
01:34:15.061 --> 01:34:17.101
<v Speaker 6>girl.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a perfect movie for an eight year </v>

2035
01:34:17.101 --> 01:34:17.101
<v Speaker 6>old girl.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's my review.</v>

2036
01:34:17.101 --> 01:34:18.700
<v Speaker 6>Had she seen the original kind of scary.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She doesn't have to.</v>

2037
01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:24.120
<v Speaker 6>Here's the thing about.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Here's the thing about watching </v>

2038
01:34:24.120 --> 01:34:25.840
<v Speaker 6>ghostbusters in new form,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if the original didn't exist,</v>

2039
01:34:26.110 --> 01:34:28.660
<v Speaker 6>it's kind of a fun movie.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's stupid.</v>

2040
01:34:29.050 --> 01:34:31.480
<v Speaker 6>There's some giant leaps.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's some.</v>

2041
01:34:32.020 --> 01:34:35.290
<v Speaker 6>There's some kind of clunky writing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but there's also some funny shit.</v>

2042
01:34:35.830 --> 01:34:39.840
<v Speaker 6>There's some funny moment I heard it was</v>
<v Speaker 6>all man hating and ends with not all man</v>

2043
01:34:39.841 --> 01:34:41.680
<v Speaker 6>hating,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but definitely a lot of man hating.</v>

2044
01:34:41.890 --> 01:34:45.340
<v Speaker 6>There was definitely every move.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Every dude in the movie was a dork,</v>

2045
01:34:45.460 --> 01:34:49.450
<v Speaker 6>but it's not the only one who was really</v>
<v Speaker 6>unbelievable that.</v>

2046
01:34:49.451 --> 01:34:51.100
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like literally wasn't believable.</v>

2047
01:34:51.160 --> 01:34:53.620
<v Speaker 6>Was chris hemsworth the guy?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2048
01:34:53.980 --> 01:34:55.690
<v Speaker 6>it was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was really good.</v>

2049
01:34:55.691 --> 01:34:57.350
<v Speaker 6>I heard it was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was really funny,</v>

2050
01:34:57.560 --> 01:34:58.150
<v Speaker 6>but he's</v>

2051
01:34:58.160 --> 01:35:03.160
<v Speaker 1>so stupid in the movie that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievable and these girls are like </v>

2052
01:35:04.361 --> 01:35:06.590
<v Speaker 1>constantly enamored with him in love </v>
<v Speaker 1>with them,</v>

2053
01:35:06.591 --> 01:35:10.430
<v Speaker 1>but they can't believe how dumb he is </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's like sort of this running gag</v>

2054
01:35:10.431 --> 01:35:12.320
<v Speaker 1>to the point where it's almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous.</v>

2055
01:35:12.740 --> 01:35:16.550
<v Speaker 1>But here's what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if that bothers you,</v>

2056
01:35:16.670 --> 01:35:20.780
<v Speaker 1>what kind of a bitch are you like that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>really bothering you?</v>

2057
01:35:20.781 --> 01:35:25.781
<v Speaker 1>That these women are shitting on men to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the point where they're taking chris </v>

2058
01:35:25.781 --> 01:35:26.750
<v Speaker 1>hemsworth and they're making them dumb </v>
<v Speaker 1>kit at all.</v>

2059
01:35:26.751 --> 01:35:28.250
<v Speaker 1>The dumb bitches that had been in </v>
<v Speaker 1>movies.</v>

2060
01:35:28.251 --> 01:35:30.470
<v Speaker 1>Can't we have one movie where these </v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

2061
01:35:30.910 --> 01:35:35.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not so good looking girls take over the </v>

2062
01:35:35.910 --> 01:35:36.690
<v Speaker 1>fucking world and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and save everybody and,</v>

2063
01:35:36.691 --> 01:35:41.691
<v Speaker 1>and have the dudes be all fucked up </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking or a or a mass or crazy or chris</v>

2064
01:35:43.490 --> 01:35:45.980
<v Speaker 1>hemsworth and chris hemsworth was </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect and beautiful.</v>

2065
01:35:46.250 --> 01:35:51.250
<v Speaker 1>Also like the dumbest human being that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever walked the face of the planet and </v>

2066
01:35:51.250 --> 01:35:51.710
<v Speaker 1>an actor showing his head shots like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole deal.</v>

2067
01:35:51.710 --> 01:35:56.710
<v Speaker 1>You like super cliche.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I never go to the movies anymore </v>

2068
01:35:56.710 --> 01:36:00.790
<v Speaker 1>because of the problem I'm having with </v>
<v Speaker 1>things like ghostbusters though and </v>

2069
01:36:00.790 --> 01:36:01.280
<v Speaker 1>stuff where the hype doesn't live up to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the movie.</v>

2070
01:36:01.281 --> 01:36:04.400
<v Speaker 1>The movie sucks so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe I didn't have to suck.</v>

2071
01:36:04.430 --> 01:36:05.540
<v Speaker 1>That was my point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2072
01:36:05.570 --> 01:36:10.570
<v Speaker 1>It didn't have to suck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like there was some funny shit in </v>

2073
01:36:10.570 --> 01:36:13.031
<v Speaker 1>the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to give away any parts of </v>

2074
01:36:13.031 --> 01:36:13.031
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Were there,</v>

2075
01:36:13.031 --> 01:36:14.570
<v Speaker 1>there was some like clever turns in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning of the movie where I laughed.</v>

2076
01:36:14.660 --> 01:36:15.110
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

2077
01:36:15.111 --> 01:36:16.280
<v Speaker 1>this is funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is funny,</v>

2078
01:36:16.281 --> 01:36:18.860
<v Speaker 1>and I thought of myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to watch that movie saying,</v>

2079
01:36:18.890 --> 01:36:22.130
<v Speaker 1>if I saw this movie without having known</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the first movie,</v>

2080
01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:24.500
<v Speaker 1>what would I think about it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially because I'm taking my kids.</v>

2081
01:36:24.501 --> 01:36:26.240
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a good movie to take kids to.</v>

2082
01:36:26.240 --> 01:36:27.380
<v Speaker 1>It's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Silly.</v>

2083
01:36:27.381 --> 01:36:28.550
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of scary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like whoa,</v>

2084
01:36:28.551 --> 01:36:32.240
<v Speaker 1>but it's obviously really fake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>

2085
01:36:32.270 --> 01:36:37.270
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't that bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't a point where anybody would </v>

2086
01:36:37.270 --> 01:36:39.701
<v Speaker 1>get mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only reason why anybody got mad is </v>

2087
01:36:39.701 --> 01:36:42.671
<v Speaker 1>because it's a redo of the original </v>
<v Speaker 1>ghostbusters and it's all women instead </v>

2088
01:36:42.671 --> 01:36:44.750
<v Speaker 1>of all men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody got fucking terrified or angry</v>

2089
01:36:44.751 --> 01:36:48.650
<v Speaker 1>or frustrated or pissed or who's fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>social justice warriors.</v>

2090
01:36:49.190 --> 01:36:54.190
<v Speaker 1>My thought is who gives a fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like is that really a concern that </v>

2091
01:36:55.431 --> 01:36:59.060
<v Speaker 1>they've decided to try to make money by </v>
<v Speaker 1>reducing ghostbusters with chicks?</v>

2092
01:36:59.210 --> 01:37:01.060
<v Speaker 1>Like isn't that an obvious thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

2093
01:37:01.120 --> 01:37:06.120
<v Speaker 1>I thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the biggest concern for me </v>

2094
01:37:06.120 --> 01:37:06.120
<v Speaker 1>lately with movies is the stories aren't</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

2095
01:37:06.120 --> 01:37:09.941
<v Speaker 1>We're just looking at so much cgi and </v>
<v Speaker 1>tricks that they need to really think </v>

2096
01:37:09.941 --> 01:37:09.941
<v Speaker 1>about like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>holy shit,</v>

2097
01:37:09.941 --> 01:37:12.590
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck was the plot of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie?</v>

2098
01:37:12.740 --> 01:37:13.850
<v Speaker 1>Will that was ghostbusters?</v>

2099
01:37:14.060 --> 01:37:14.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>

2100
01:37:15.170 --> 01:37:20.170
<v Speaker 1>There was definitely part of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was also some really clunky </v>

2101
01:37:20.170 --> 01:37:20.170
<v Speaker 1>writing there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something like that,</v>

2102
01:37:20.170 --> 01:37:22.280
<v Speaker 1>like with the point where yoU saw them </v>
<v Speaker 1>in some scenes early on.</v>

2103
01:37:22.281 --> 01:37:26.420
<v Speaker 1>They're really fun and unexpected and </v>
<v Speaker 1>light fun kind of scenes like,</v>

2104
01:37:26.421 --> 01:37:28.700
<v Speaker 1>this is kind of fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This movie's kind of fucking weird.</v>

2105
01:37:28.940 --> 01:37:31.700
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's not a bad movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you're like,</v>

2106
01:37:32.120 --> 01:37:33.020
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's kinda bad.</v>

2107
01:37:33.021 --> 01:37:34.520
<v Speaker 1>Here we.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This part's kind of bad.</v>

2108
01:37:34.550 --> 01:37:36.080
<v Speaker 1>It's all like a bunch of different </v>
<v Speaker 1>movies.</v>

2109
01:37:36.081 --> 01:37:40.790
<v Speaker 1>It's not like if you go back and watch </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a pick a classic movie,</v>

2110
01:37:40.820 --> 01:37:42.740
<v Speaker 1>like if you go Watch the outlaw josey </v>
<v Speaker 1>wales,</v>

2111
01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:48.160
<v Speaker 1>the outlaw josey wales is the outlaw </v>
<v Speaker 1>josey wales froM minute one to the time </v>

2112
01:37:48.711 --> 01:37:51.650
<v Speaker 1>of the end of the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't vary in the way it feels.</v>

2113
01:37:52.160 --> 01:37:55.920
<v Speaker 1>It feels like the outlaw josey wales.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a beautiful work of art.</v>

2114
01:37:56.370 --> 01:38:01.370
<v Speaker 4>It's seamless iN its production,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the way it portrays everything is </v>

2115
01:38:02.071 --> 01:38:07.071
<v Speaker 4>the same through the whole movie and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>builds up and it makes you feel like </v>

2116
01:38:07.071 --> 01:38:07.320
<v Speaker 4>you're really engrossed in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gripped in it.</v>

2117
01:38:07.830 --> 01:38:12.830
<v Speaker 4>ThiS movie didn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This ghostbusters movie would take you </v>

2118
01:38:12.830 --> 01:38:13.140
<v Speaker 4>in and pull you away and take you to </v>
<v Speaker 4>push you away from it.</v>

2119
01:38:13.490 --> 01:38:15.170
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would be so clunky at tiMes.</v>

2120
01:38:15.171 --> 01:38:15.960
<v Speaker 4>You'd be like,</v>

01:40:02.090 --> 01:40:03.170
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So at home,</v>

2164
01:40:03.380 --> 01:40:06.590
<v Speaker 5>do you like seeing movies in the theater</v>
<v Speaker 5>or action movies specifically?</v>

2165
01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:09.530
<v Speaker 5>Do you think that's important to see </v>
<v Speaker 5>them there versus at home?</v>

2166
01:40:09.620 --> 01:40:14.620
<v Speaker 5>Unless your p digitally.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean like when you got some gigantic </v>

2167
01:40:14.620 --> 01:40:15.330
<v Speaker 5>ass fucking house with a movie theater </v>
<v Speaker 5>and it,</v>

2168
01:40:15.790 --> 01:40:18.200
<v Speaker 5>you're not going to get the same effect </v>
<v Speaker 5>of the sound.</v>

2169
01:40:18.480 --> 01:40:21.430
<v Speaker 4>I think the when when someone is a </v>
<v Speaker 4>composer,</v>

2170
01:40:21.490 --> 01:40:26.490
<v Speaker 4>like let's take for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like certain movies that have amazing </v>

2171
01:40:26.490 --> 01:40:29.350
<v Speaker 4>soundtracks and like you hear things </v>
<v Speaker 4>happening behind you.</v>

2172
01:40:29.351 --> 01:40:33.400
<v Speaker 4>Like The most recent star wars movie </v>
<v Speaker 4>soundtrack was incredible and like this,</v>

2173
01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:39.120
<v Speaker 4>all these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's all this shit going on.</v>

2174
01:40:39.121 --> 01:40:44.121
<v Speaker 4>It's part of the experience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'll wash this giant ass fucking </v>

2175
01:40:44.121 --> 01:40:44.121
<v Speaker 4>screen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'S beautiful.</v>

2176
01:40:44.121 --> 01:40:46.020
<v Speaker 4>Crystal clear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The sound is incredible.</v>

2177
01:40:46.021 --> 01:40:48.120
<v Speaker 4>Literally feels like it's coming from </v>
<v Speaker 4>everywhere in the room.</v>

2178
01:40:48.300 --> 01:40:51.780
<v Speaker 4>You can't reproduce that at home.</v>
<v Speaker 4>so in that case,</v>

2179
01:40:51.781 --> 01:40:54.010
<v Speaker 4>I think that yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for some kinds</v>

2180
01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:56.680
<v Speaker 1>of movies watching it in a movie theater</v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

2181
01:40:56.681 --> 01:41:01.681
<v Speaker 1>But how about a country with no country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no country for old men that's totally </v>

2182
01:41:02.801 --> 01:41:03.190
<v Speaker 1>unnecessary.</v>

2183
01:41:03.240 --> 01:41:05.430
<v Speaker 5>Watch that movie in the movie theater,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we don't need to require that.</v>

2184
01:41:05.620 --> 01:41:10.620
<v Speaker 5>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not a big sound movie though to </v>

2185
01:41:10.620 --> 01:41:10.620
<v Speaker 5>sound is required and whatnot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But like it's not.</v>

2186
01:41:10.620 --> 01:41:12.030
<v Speaker 5>There's no big sound elements in it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2187
01:41:12.031 --> 01:41:12.200
<v Speaker 5>It's awesome.</v>

2188
01:41:12.310 --> 01:41:15.580
<v Speaker 1>Some movie that might be better if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>absorb it by yourself,</v>

2189
01:41:15.760 --> 01:41:20.760
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to be influenced by </v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody because it's such a movie that </v>

2190
01:41:20.760 --> 01:41:20.860
<v Speaker 1>makes you think so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like even the end of it,</v>

2191
01:41:20.890 --> 01:41:22.960
<v Speaker 1>the individual sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to give it away,</v>

2192
01:41:22.961 --> 01:41:27.961
<v Speaker 1>but it's a very strange ending,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's one of the best movies I've </v>

2193
01:41:27.961 --> 01:41:31.381
<v Speaker 1>ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's one of those movies where as </v>

2194
01:41:31.381 --> 01:41:31.381
<v Speaker 1>you're watching it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like in gripped,</v>

2195
01:41:31.381 --> 01:41:31.870
<v Speaker 1>you're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2196
01:41:31.950 --> 01:41:36.950
<v Speaker 1>it takes you to this place and you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to be distracted in any way when </v>

2197
01:41:37.061 --> 01:41:42.061
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's not doing anything you </v>

2198
01:41:42.061 --> 01:41:42.910
<v Speaker 1>expected to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's doing all sorts of weird shit.</v>

2199
01:41:43.240 --> 01:41:45.580
<v Speaker 1>Like it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very different than a lot of movies</v>

2200
01:41:45.581 --> 01:41:50.581
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of movies that have this very </v>
<v Speaker 1>specific formula that even if they get </v>

2201
01:41:50.581 --> 01:41:54.061
<v Speaker 1>creative inside that formula,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they still stick to the formula and the </v>

2202
01:41:54.061 --> 01:41:54.430
<v Speaker 1>good guy wins in the end and all that </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff happened.</v>

2203
01:41:54.460 --> 01:41:56.710
<v Speaker 1>This movie is not like that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None.</v>

2204
01:41:56.920 --> 01:42:01.920
<v Speaker 1>No country for old men took me like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of years to really appreciate </v>

2205
01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:03.160
<v Speaker 1>what it was all about because I saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2206
01:42:03.190 --> 01:42:04.600
<v Speaker 1>god,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they acting is so good.</v>

2207
01:42:04.601 --> 01:42:06.220
<v Speaker 1>The story so compelling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what is,</v>

2208
01:42:06.250 --> 01:42:07.810
<v Speaker 1>what is missing in this thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2209
01:42:07.811 --> 01:42:09.310
<v Speaker 1>it's missing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not tidy.</v>

2210
01:42:09.820 --> 01:42:13.300
<v Speaker 1>It's like this just spectacular work of </v>
<v Speaker 1>drama.</v>

2211
01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:18.720
<v Speaker 1>So much shit going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just leaves you with this feeling of </v>

2212
01:42:18.720 --> 01:42:19.630
<v Speaker 1>whoa at the end of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2213
01:42:20.560 --> 01:42:22.580
<v Speaker 1>And I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2214
01:42:22.690 --> 01:42:24.340
<v Speaker 1>movies like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

2215
01:42:24.341 --> 01:42:26.950
<v Speaker 1>that's a rare accomplishment to like </v>
<v Speaker 1>they.</v>

2216
01:42:27.010 --> 01:42:32.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of like what we're talking </v>

2217
01:42:32.010 --> 01:42:32.010
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael Phelps being so incredible.</v>

2218
01:42:32.010 --> 01:42:34.380
<v Speaker 1>It's something that everybody could do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's,</v>

2219
01:42:34.820 --> 01:42:39.820
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's all kinds of movies that are </v>

2220
01:42:39.820 --> 01:42:41.911
<v Speaker 1>awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then every now and then you get a </v>

2221
01:42:41.911 --> 01:42:41.911
<v Speaker 1>movie that makes you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I got complete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>redefiner are</v>

2223
01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:47.450

<v Speaker 5>but when it happens,</v>

2224
01:42:47.460 --> 01:42:49.780
<v Speaker 5>when you hear that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the last five that aren't that like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>that sucked and everyone told me it was </v>

2226
01:42:56.180 --> 01:42:57.880
<v Speaker 5>an amazing movie inside out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is a pixar movie.</v>

<v Speaker 5>They think it's a legacy.</v>

2239
01:43:26.560 --> 01:43:31.560
<v Speaker 5>I hang out with a six year old that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>love dearly child that you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

2391
01:50:28.361 --> 01:50:31.900
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have bet anything on it.</v>

2392
01:50:33.670 --> 01:50:35.800
<v Speaker 1>It makes zero sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's all bet.</v>

2393
01:50:35.801 --> 01:50:37.240
<v Speaker 1>$5.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2394
01:50:37.410 --> 01:50:38.980
<v Speaker 1>Since you said he'd bet everything on </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2395
01:50:38.981 --> 01:50:41.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm putting you money on the table,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fella.</v>

2396
01:50:42.080 --> 01:50:44.200
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go to the carpet.</v>

2397
01:50:44.260 --> 01:50:45.130
<v Speaker 1>Tell us the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>

2398
01:50:45.220 --> 01:50:47.700
<v Speaker 1>Times moving faster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I was.</v>

2399
01:50:48.100 --> 01:50:53.100
<v Speaker 1>I was watching this thing on on planets </v>
<v Speaker 1>and about the expansion of the universe </v>

2400
01:50:53.291 --> 01:50:55.780
<v Speaker 1>and not only the expansion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the fact that it's accelerating.</v>

2401
01:50:56.050 --> 01:51:01.050
<v Speaker 1>It's moving apart faster and faster and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they dIdn't know this 20 years ago </v>

2402
01:51:01.050 --> 01:51:05.490
<v Speaker 1>and I was listening to this guy speak </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it and I remember thinking to </v>

2403
01:51:05.490 --> 01:51:06.130
<v Speaker 1>myself like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is so crazy,</v>

2404
01:51:06.131 --> 01:51:11.131
<v Speaker 1>like that is a huge factor in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence that this universe is not just</v>

2405
01:51:11.681 --> 01:51:16.681
<v Speaker 1>static but it's moving away and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>accelerating in some sort of strange way</v>

2406
01:51:17.630 --> 01:51:22.630
<v Speaker 1>and that they can measure it when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>measure it over 10 or 20 years is a </v>

2407
01:51:22.630 --> 01:51:24.880
<v Speaker 1>measurable number that allows them to </v>
<v Speaker 1>discern like,</v>

2408
01:51:24.881 --> 01:51:29.881
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were positive that this thing is not </v>

2409
01:51:29.881 --> 01:51:33.211
<v Speaker 1>just moving but accelerating and this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>our universe and they just figured that </v>

2410
01:51:33.211 --> 01:51:33.280
<v Speaker 1>out 20 years ago.</v>

2411
01:51:33.530 --> 01:51:38.530
<v Speaker 1>like we're just waking up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like we're on a starship and we're </v>

2412
01:51:38.530 --> 01:51:39.040
<v Speaker 1>flying through the university.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just came out of hyperspace and we're</v>

2413
01:51:39.041 --> 01:51:40.270
<v Speaker 1>all like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2414
01:51:40.390 --> 01:51:41.950
<v Speaker 1>where are we going?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is,</v>

2415
01:51:42.400 --> 01:51:43.210
<v Speaker 1>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is this?</v>

2416
01:51:43.230 --> 01:51:45.130
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does anybody have a manual?</v>

2417
01:51:45.360 --> 01:51:50.360
<v Speaker 1>Here's the manual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to go look through the shit </v>

2418
01:51:50.360 --> 01:51:51.190
<v Speaker 1>that the old people wrote down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We literally are exactly the same thing.</v>

2419
01:51:51.520 --> 01:51:56.520
<v Speaker 1>Like we get taught by people who get </v>
<v Speaker 1>taught by people who get taught by </v>

2420
01:51:56.520 --> 01:51:57.430
<v Speaker 1>people who are basically monkeys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2421
01:51:57.550 --> 01:52:02.550
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is like a few chains away from us </v>

2422
01:52:02.550 --> 01:52:02.680
<v Speaker 1>and dudes with sticks trying to kill </v>
<v Speaker 1>giraffes and shit.</v>

2423
01:52:02.970 --> 01:52:06.610
<v Speaker 1>There's not that many.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you Go back in time like numbers,</v>

2424
01:52:06.850 --> 01:52:11.850
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't get Like 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 times and then you're in the caveman </v>

2425
01:52:11.850 --> 01:52:12.460
<v Speaker 1>era.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That shit is not that far ago,</v>

2426
01:52:12.461 --> 01:52:15.040
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that far ago.</v>

2427
01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.730
<v Speaker 1>So we're like waking up in the middle of</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this trip,</v>

2428
01:52:22.040 --> 01:52:27.040
<v Speaker 1>this whole galaxy hurling through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe going a thousand miles an hour </v>

2429
01:52:27.040 --> 01:52:30.790
<v Speaker 1>and a circle flying around a huge </v>
<v Speaker 1>nuclear explosion a million times bigger</v>

2430
01:52:30.791 --> 01:52:35.791
<v Speaker 1>than it just flying through the universe</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're waking up and we're going,</v>

2431
01:52:36.250 --> 01:52:37.810
<v Speaker 1>what about gay marriage?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that.</v>

2435
01:52:41.170 --> 01:52:46.170
<v Speaker 1>WeLl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need to revamp the entire tax rates </v>

2436
01:52:46.170 --> 01:52:46.170

2437
01:52:46.190 --> 01:52:51.190
<v Speaker 6>meanwhile flying through infinity and we</v>
<v Speaker 6>just realizing it.</v>

2438
01:52:51.740 --> 01:52:52.490
<v Speaker 6>We're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

01:52:52.491 --> 01:52:57.491
<v Speaker 6>we're not.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not only is the son not the center of </v>

2440
01:52:57.491 --> 01:53:01.511
<v Speaker 6>the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not only is the earth not the center of </v>

2441
01:53:01.511 --> 01:53:03.251
<v Speaker 6>the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but this galaxy is just one of hundreds </v>

2442
01:53:03.251 --> 01:53:03.770
<v Speaker 6>of billions.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's untold numbers.</v>

2443
01:53:04.130 --> 01:53:06.670
<v Speaker 6>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but inside each galaxy is a supermassive</v>

2444
01:53:06.680 --> 01:53:11.680
<v Speaker 6>black hole that's one half of one </v>
<v Speaker 6>percent of the mass of the entire </v>

2445
01:53:11.680 --> 01:53:11.680
<v Speaker 6>galaxy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and if you go through that,</v>

2446
01:53:11.680 --> 01:53:13.910
<v Speaker 6>there might be an unlimited number of </v>
<v Speaker 6>universes.</v>

<v Speaker 6>In theory.</v>

2500
01:55:49.800 --> 01:55:54.800
<v Speaker 6>Here's why it doesn't work in practice.</v>

01:57:51.450 --> 01:57:52.980
<v Speaker 6>Like I have a good buddy of mine,</v>

<v Speaker 6>12 hours a day.</v>

01:57:54.710 --> 01:57:59.710
<v Speaker 6>He has hIs own business and he's always </v>
<v Speaker 6>working and he's fucking exhausted and </v>

2554
01:57:59.710 --> 01:58:01.060
<v Speaker 6>sometimes he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>ah,</v>

2555
01:58:01.080 --> 01:58:02.940
<v Speaker 6>what about the accounts and what about </v>
<v Speaker 6>this and that,</v>

01:58:03.320 --> 01:58:08.320
<v Speaker 6>and he'll take an ambient and pop off </v>
<v Speaker 6>and I feel like now all I have to do is </v>

2557
01:58:08.320 --> 01:58:12.471
<v Speaker 6>just eat and I'll fall asleep for like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know what it means.</v>

2558
01:58:12.720 --> 01:58:17.360
<v Speaker 6>Like last night I had chicken wings and </v>
<v Speaker 6>I fell asleep like men child.</v>

2559
01:58:18.720 --> 01:58:21.380
<v Speaker 6>Do you know about their child's brian?</v>
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

2560
01:58:21.390 --> 01:58:26.390
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's like I don't understand </v>
<v Speaker 6>these people like I guess we have jobs </v>

2561
01:58:26.390 --> 01:58:28.290
<v Speaker 6>and they don't sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Whatever funnel I could sleep,</v>

2562
01:58:28.530 --> 01:58:31.380
<v Speaker 6>I don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Food does not gIve me energy.</v>

2563
01:58:31.381 --> 01:58:33.630
<v Speaker 6>It just makes me sleepy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2564
01:58:33.710 --> 01:58:36.330
<v Speaker 6>it does,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but It also robs you of resources.</v>

2565
01:58:36.331 --> 01:58:41.331
<v Speaker 6>It's really not a good idea to eat a lot</v>
<v Speaker 6>of food before you go to bed because a </v>

2566
01:58:41.331 --> 01:58:42.010
<v Speaker 6>lot of times you bought body starts </v>
<v Speaker 6>digesting that food</v>

2567
01:58:42.010 --> 01:58:45.760
<v Speaker 4>and it uses up resources which you </v>
<v Speaker 4>should go to bed.</v>

2568
01:58:45.910 --> 01:58:50.910
<v Speaker 4>You shouldn't be hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there should be some time between </v>

2569
01:58:50.910 --> 01:58:54.291
<v Speaker 4>when you eat and when you go to bed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>allow your body to them food so that </v>

2570
01:58:54.291 --> 01:58:57.871
<v Speaker 4>your body can adequately go into the </v>
<v Speaker 4>many stages that it requires to really </v>

2571
01:58:57.871 --> 01:58:58.420
<v Speaker 4>rebuild your system.</v>

2572
01:58:58.810 --> 01:59:01.080
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to feel like I eat now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll fall asleep like I'll be like.</v>

2573
01:59:01.290 --> 01:59:06.290
<v Speaker 5>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'm just saying like it's not the </v>

2574
01:59:06.290 --> 01:59:06.290
<v Speaker 5>smartest thing to do.</v>

2575
01:59:06.290 --> 01:59:10.620
<v Speaker 4>Gets sleepy after they eat a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's really not the right the right </v>

2576
01:59:10.620 --> 01:59:10.620
<v Speaker 4>thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>the right thing to do,</v>

2577
01:59:10.620 --> 01:59:12.360
<v Speaker 4>especially if you eat anything heavy </v>

02:01:08.840 --> 02:01:09.450
<v Speaker 5>So.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2617
02:01:09.451 --> 02:01:11.300
<v Speaker 5>that's what baking in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2618
02:01:11.330 --> 02:01:12.770
<v Speaker 5>let me explain to you what bacon</v>

2619
02:01:12.770 --> 02:01:15.950
<v Speaker 4>is because if you don't know because I </v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't know until a couple of years ago.</v>

2620
02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:16.670
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bacon.</v>

2621
02:01:16.671 --> 02:01:19.710
<v Speaker 4>Is this part of the pig?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The bottom half a pig.</v>

2622
02:01:19.940 --> 02:01:24.770
<v Speaker 4>This is one of the reasons whY bacon </v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't really exist on wild boars.</v>

2623
02:01:25.790 --> 02:01:26.380
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2624
02:01:26.390 --> 02:01:31.130
<v Speaker 4>I've only shot one wild pig and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't have any bacon.</v>

2625
02:01:31.131 --> 02:01:33.410
<v Speaker 4>MaN.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're out there hustling.</v>

2626
02:01:33.870 --> 02:01:35.210
<v Speaker 4>They're a different animal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

2627
02:01:35.211 --> 02:01:36.710
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't look the same either.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2628
02:01:36.780 --> 02:01:39.110
<v Speaker 4>I shot a pretty big one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was pretty well fed,</v>

2629
02:01:39.500 --> 02:01:40.070
<v Speaker 4>but their</v>

2630
02:01:40.070 --> 02:01:40.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

2631
02:01:40.790 --> 02:01:44.450
<v Speaker 1>their skin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their flesh is not pink or white,</v>

2632
02:01:44.870 --> 02:01:45.640
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2633
02:01:45.670 --> 02:01:46.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was always pork.</v>

2634
02:01:46.671 --> 02:01:51.671
<v Speaker 1>The other white meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not supposed to be white because </v>

2635
02:01:51.671 --> 02:01:54.660
<v Speaker 1>they're out there eating egg corns and </v>
<v Speaker 1>ground nesting birds and all the stuff </v>

2636
02:01:54.660 --> 02:01:54.660
<v Speaker 1>that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

2637
02:01:54.660 --> 02:01:57.890
<v Speaker 1>they're not herbivores either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those things are omnivores.</v>

2638
02:01:57.920 --> 02:02:00.050
<v Speaker 1>TheY eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they eat fucking everything district.</v>

2639
02:02:00.140 --> 02:02:05.140
<v Speaker 1>There's this picture that I tweeted a </v>
<v Speaker 1>few months back of a boar running away </v>

2640
02:02:05.751 --> 02:02:10.751
<v Speaker 1>with a font in its mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a small deer and its mouth and a </v>

2641
02:02:10.751 --> 02:02:11.360
<v Speaker 1>lot of people were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

2642
02:02:11.420 --> 02:02:14.750
<v Speaker 1>I did not know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They eat babies,</v>

2643
02:02:14.780 --> 02:02:17.600
<v Speaker 1>they'll eat a deer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they fucking eat your cat.</v>

2644

<v Speaker 1>They'll you to you fuck an.</v>

2645
02:02:23.050 --> 02:02:28.050
<v Speaker 1>Apparently every year someone falls into</v>
<v Speaker 1>a pen with pigs on a farm and gets </v>

2646
02:02:28.050 --> 02:02:33.011
<v Speaker 1>jacked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at this pig running off with his </v>

2647
02:02:33.011 --> 02:02:33.011
<v Speaker 1>deer and it's mal.</v>

2648
02:02:33.011 --> 02:02:34.040
<v Speaker 1>How yo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's dark.</v>

2649
02:02:34.070 --> 02:02:36.040
<v Speaker 1>Do you see that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Speaking of pigs in derek,</v>

2650
02:02:36.050 --> 02:02:38.420
<v Speaker 1>did you see that cop shooting the deer </v>
<v Speaker 1>video?</v>

2651
02:02:38.421 --> 02:02:40.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fucked up man.</v>

2652
02:02:40.370 --> 02:02:42.470
<v Speaker 1>I did a shot right in the head is so </v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid.</v>

2653
02:02:43.200 --> 02:02:45.300
<v Speaker 1>It's so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he,</v>

2654
02:02:45.301 --> 02:02:47.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was really callous.</v>

2655
02:02:47.300 --> 02:02:49.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was brutal.</v>

2656
02:02:49.490 --> 02:02:50.330
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

2657
02:02:50.990 --> 02:02:52.160
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was really callous,</v>

2658
02:02:52.161 --> 02:02:53.210
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was weird.</v>

2659
02:02:53.270 --> 02:02:55.430
<v Speaker 1>I guess he had to do it though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what they said.</v>

2660
02:02:55.520 --> 02:02:56.510
<v Speaker 1>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have to shoot it?</v>

2661
02:02:57.170 --> 02:03:00.980
<v Speaker 1>I think he asked someone what to do and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they said put it down.</v>

2662
02:03:01.250 --> 02:03:06.250
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to put it Down the way </v>

2663
02:03:06.250 --> 02:03:08.081
<v Speaker 1>he did it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though it looked crazy because he </v>

2664
02:03:08.081 --> 02:03:08.081
<v Speaker 1>did it in front of everybody with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way he did,</v>

2665
02:03:08.081 --> 02:03:09.980
<v Speaker 1>it was the best way to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>honestly.</v>

2666
02:03:10.670 --> 02:03:12.680
<v Speaker 1>Shoeing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>HeRe's the thing.</v>

2667
02:03:12.810 --> 02:03:17.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what they're going to do </v>

2668
02:03:17.810 --> 02:03:17.810
<v Speaker 1>with the body.</v>

2669
02:03:17.810 --> 02:03:19.810
<v Speaker 1>I would hope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hope they give that meet to hunters for </v>

2670
02:03:19.810 --> 02:03:24.791
<v Speaker 1>the hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a program that's an America </v>

2671
02:03:24.791 --> 02:03:24.791
<v Speaker 1>where hunters like say if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2672
02:03:25.040 --> 02:03:29.990
<v Speaker 1>you come over here to experience like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the midwest of the United States,</v>

2673
02:03:29.991 --> 02:03:32.720
<v Speaker 1>like Iowa in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2674
02:03:32.800 --> 02:03:34.310
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kansas.</v>

2675
02:03:34.311 --> 02:03:39.311
<v Speaker 1>A lot of these areas are famous all </v>
<v Speaker 1>across the world for having these </v>

2676
02:03:39.311 --> 02:03:43.720
<v Speaker 1>gigantic white tail deer and it becomes </v>
<v Speaker 1>a thing like white tail deer in the </v>

2677
02:03:44.991 --> 02:03:49.991
<v Speaker 1>midwest of the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is something I've only found out </v>

2678
02:03:49.991 --> 02:03:53.081
<v Speaker 1>over the last few years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously of me getting interested in </v>

2679
02:03:53.081 --> 02:03:53.600
<v Speaker 1>hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but white tail deer hunting,</v>

2680
02:03:53.960 --> 02:03:57.290
<v Speaker 1>like people hear about it from scotland </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they want to come over here.</v>

2681
02:03:57.291 --> 02:03:59.510
<v Speaker 1>People hear about it from China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to come over here.</v>

2682
02:03:59.511 --> 02:04:04.200
<v Speaker 1>They want to experience what it's like </v>
<v Speaker 1>to to hunt white tail deer in Iowa.</v>

2683
02:04:04.201 --> 02:04:09.050
<v Speaker 1>It becomes like this thing and sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 1>people from other places that don't live</v>

2684
02:04:09.051 --> 02:04:09.770
<v Speaker 1>in Iowa will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll,</v>

2685
02:04:09.830 --> 02:04:14.830
<v Speaker 1>they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll put in tags and they'll put in </v>

2686
02:04:14.830 --> 02:04:16.751
<v Speaker 1>tags over and over and over and over and</v>
<v Speaker 1>over and over and over and finally they </v>

2687
02:04:16.751 --> 02:04:20.531
<v Speaker 1>get one and they can go there and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>can experience what it's like and then </v>

2688
02:04:20.531 --> 02:04:22.880
<v Speaker 1>they can't bring the meat back to China </v>
<v Speaker 1>or Australia.</v>

2689
02:04:22.880 --> 02:04:24.170
<v Speaker 1>They can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they won't let you.</v>

2690
02:04:24.350 --> 02:04:29.350
<v Speaker 1>Like if you try to fly with a dead deer </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the United States and flying into </v>

2691
02:04:29.350 --> 02:04:29.780
<v Speaker 1>Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd be like,</v>

2692
02:04:29.781 --> 02:04:32.240
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you,</v>

2693
02:04:32.270 --> 02:04:34.550
<v Speaker 1>you can't take a chance and going across</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fucking ocean,</v>

2694
02:04:34.760 --> 02:04:38.070
<v Speaker 1>it's really funny because if you go from</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nevada to like Ohio,</v>

2695
02:04:38.070 --> 02:04:38.790
<v Speaker 4>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2696
02:04:38.880 --> 02:04:39.670
<v Speaker 4>what do you got in there?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2697
02:04:39.671 --> 02:04:40.930
<v Speaker 4>I shot A deer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Congratulations.</v>

2698
02:04:41.310 --> 02:04:42.720
<v Speaker 4>but he can't fly across water.</v>

2699
02:04:44.210 --> 02:04:45.950
<v Speaker 5>We're going to cross water.</v>

2700
02:04:46.440 --> 02:04:51.440
<v Speaker 4>It's very tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even if you try to bring an animal down </v>

2701
02:04:51.440 --> 02:04:53.190
<v Speaker 4>from Canada into the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2702
02:04:53.260 --> 02:04:55.170
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'm talking about a dead animal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2703
02:04:55.171 --> 02:04:57.360
<v Speaker 4>you're trying to bring a dead animal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's um,</v>

2704
02:04:57.420 --> 02:05:01.680
<v Speaker 4>sO it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's one of those things Where it,</v>

2705
02:05:01.681 --> 02:05:06.681
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like these people donate money or do </v>

2706
02:05:06.681 --> 02:05:09.561
<v Speaker 4>they donate food?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if they come over here and they want </v>

2707
02:05:09.561 --> 02:05:09.561
<v Speaker 4>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they're a hunter from Australia,</v>

2708
02:05:09.561 --> 02:05:10.590
<v Speaker 4>they want to experience what it's like </v>
<v Speaker 4>to hunt in Iowa.</v>

2709
02:05:10.890 --> 02:05:15.890
<v Speaker 4>They can donate money or In the sense of</v>
<v Speaker 4>they can donate food rather to a,</v>

2710
02:05:16.530 --> 02:05:20.520
<v Speaker 4>like a lot of hungry people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if you shoot a 200 pound white tail</v>

2711
02:05:20.550 --> 02:05:25.550
<v Speaker 4>deer that's gonna feed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's going to be more than probably in</v>

2712
02:05:26.641 --> 02:05:31.080
<v Speaker 4>the neighborhood of 150 meals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's amazing.</v>

2713
02:05:32.170 --> 02:05:37.170
<v Speaker 4>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can give that away to all these </v>

2714
02:05:37.170 --> 02:05:37.170
<v Speaker 4>people that need it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2715
02:05:37.170 --> 02:05:37.440
<v Speaker 4>if you're from some other place.</v>

2716
02:05:38.670 --> 02:05:43.670
<v Speaker 5>This particular.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought I recognize this when I saw </v>

2717
02:05:43.670 --> 02:05:45.180
<v Speaker 5>the video.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Apparently this video is from 2013.</v>

2718
02:05:45.210 --> 02:05:47.610
<v Speaker 5>This is like two and a half years old.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is not a new thing.</v>

2719
02:05:47.611 --> 02:05:51.090
<v Speaker 5>It just happened to be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We don't care if it's three years old.</v>

2720
02:05:51.120 --> 02:05:53.340
<v Speaker 5>This is old shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is the one that's going around from</v>

2721
02:05:53.341 --> 02:05:58.341
<v Speaker 5>yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I saw it says also that the deer was </v>

2722
02:05:58.341 --> 02:06:02.211
<v Speaker 5>believed to be injured and what's going </v>
<v Speaker 5>to pretend a harm motorist if they try </v>

2723
02:06:02.211 --> 02:06:03.720
<v Speaker 5>to shoo it away,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is why they hit by a car.</v>

2724
02:06:04.210 --> 02:06:05.550
<v Speaker 5>It could have been hit by a car</v>

2725
02:06:06.090 --> 02:06:07.740
<v Speaker 4>also.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just could be on the way out.</v>

2726
02:06:07.920 --> 02:06:09.450
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that was a pretty big deer.</v>

2727
02:06:09.840 --> 02:06:13.200
<v Speaker 4>It could be on the way out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It could have been shot by an arrow or a</v>

2728
02:06:13.201 --> 02:06:14.300
<v Speaker 4>bullet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

2729
02:06:14.790 --> 02:06:15.720
<v Speaker 4>Somebody could have wounded it.</v>

2740
02:06:46.080 --> 02:06:48.810
<v Speaker 5>Oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look at the graphics shit.</v>

2741
02:06:51.090 --> 02:06:56.090
<v Speaker 12>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 12>so awesome.</v>

2742
02:07:05.890 --> 02:07:10.890
<v Speaker 12>Holy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Wow.</v>

2743
02:07:37.440 --> 02:07:39.010
<v Speaker 12>Pure,</v>
<v Speaker 12>pure,</v>

2744
02:07:40.080 --> 02:07:41.600
<v Speaker 12>pure.</v>
<v Speaker 12>That's</v>

2745
02:07:42.510 --> 02:07:44.470
<v Speaker 1>to be a super dork.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To know what fds is.</v>

2746
02:07:44.770 --> 02:07:45.080
<v Speaker 1>Frames</v>

2747
02:07:45.120 --> 02:07:46.580
<v Speaker 12>for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 12>That was an old hold</v>

2748
02:07:46.580 --> 02:07:48.530
<v Speaker 1>rocket arena map did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were just playing on.</v>

2749
02:07:48.890 --> 02:07:51.140
<v Speaker 1>That's what a dork I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that map.</v>

2750
02:07:51.800 --> 02:07:56.800
<v Speaker 1>The last map.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was an old map that we used to </v>

2751
02:07:56.800 --> 02:07:56.800
<v Speaker 1>always play on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember the map number.</v>

2752
02:07:57.110 --> 02:08:02.110
<v Speaker 1>There was an old map.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They definitely kept the fueled and the </v>

2753
02:08:02.110 --> 02:08:02.110
<v Speaker 1>look of the game by updated the </v>
<v Speaker 1>graphics.</v>

2754
02:08:02.110 --> 02:08:04.520
<v Speaker 1>I really liked how they stayed true to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the original formula.</v>

2755
02:08:04.550 --> 02:08:07.730
<v Speaker 1>I hope they make it so you can't shut </v>
<v Speaker 1>those graphics off.</v>

2756
02:08:08.240 --> 02:08:09.800
<v Speaker 1>This is why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people get mad at me.</v>

2757
02:08:09.980 --> 02:08:12.830
<v Speaker 1>Fuck bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Motherfucking computer doesn't have good</v>

2758
02:08:12.840 --> 02:08:17.840
<v Speaker 1>firms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is you're not playing the </v>

2759
02:08:17.840 --> 02:08:17.930
<v Speaker 1>same game as a person who's seen </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>

2760
02:08:18.140 --> 02:08:20.090
<v Speaker 1>like it's easier to play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2761
02:08:20.450 --> 02:08:25.450
<v Speaker 1>I take that back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I support your decision to mute all the </v>

2762
02:08:25.450 --> 02:08:26.240
<v Speaker 1>graphics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think he kinda missing part of the</v>

2763
02:08:26.241 --> 02:08:27.770
<v Speaker 1>fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when you play,</v>

2764
02:08:27.860 --> 02:08:29.450
<v Speaker 1>maybe not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I'm full of shit.</v>

2765
02:08:29.690 --> 02:08:32.510
<v Speaker 1>Here's why I'm full of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's why I'm definitely full of shit.</v>

2766
02:08:32.990 --> 02:08:37.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck about those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Walgett looks cool the first time you </v>

2767
02:08:37.990 --> 02:08:37.990
<v Speaker 1>see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2768
02:08:37.990 --> 02:08:39.620
<v Speaker 1>But what do you really want to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to shoot that fucking dude,</v>

2769
02:08:40.070 --> 02:08:45.070
<v Speaker 1>that's what I want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I shoot him in a perfectly muted </v>

2770
02:08:45.070 --> 02:08:46.730
<v Speaker 1>environment where he's the only thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I can aim at and everything else is</v>

2771
02:08:46.731 --> 02:08:48.730
<v Speaker 1>like mav.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2772
02:08:48.770 --> 02:08:49.850
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no tan.</v>

2773
02:08:50.240 --> 02:08:52.070
<v Speaker 1>Like what's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's a white people tan?</v>

2774
02:08:52.100 --> 02:08:57.100
<v Speaker 1>Would that be if you had a crayon like </v>
<v Speaker 1>people 10 trump or trump's not white.</v>

2775
02:09:00.020 --> 02:09:03.710
<v Speaker 1>It's like an orange garfield and people </v>
<v Speaker 1>would get super mad if you're asking for</v>

2776
02:09:03.711 --> 02:09:06.650
<v Speaker 1>a snow cone with nothing in it and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>gave him something to color of trump.</v>

2777
02:09:08.230 --> 02:09:13.230
<v Speaker 1>Like old man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his shadow leather color shed a leather </v>

2778
02:09:13.230 --> 02:09:16.270
<v Speaker 1>head today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shimmy definitely hit his head today.</v>

2779
02:09:17.860 --> 02:09:22.860
<v Speaker 1>Times spin on tmz.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Too long.</v>

2780
02:09:23.331 --> 02:09:28.331
<v Speaker 1>Did it jokes folks?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2781
02:09:29.450 --> 02:09:30.830
<v Speaker 1>no bullying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Relax.</v>

2782
02:09:30.920 --> 02:09:33.640
<v Speaker 1>Everybody relax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Relax.</v>

2783
02:09:33.810 --> 02:09:36.440
<v Speaker 1>Don't do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2784
02:09:36.560 --> 02:09:41.560
<v Speaker 1>what if you have a computer though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so powerful that it doesn't </v>

2785
02:09:41.560 --> 02:09:42.250
<v Speaker 1>matter if you have the graphics on our </v>
<v Speaker 1>night and like the textures.</v>

2786
02:09:42.260 --> 02:09:43.580
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that textures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do it.</v>

2787
02:09:43.610 --> 02:09:44.660
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't change anything.</v>

2788
02:09:44.690 --> 02:09:45.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But here's the thing.</v>

2789
02:09:45.740 --> 02:09:47.300
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not about that.</v>

2790
02:09:47.490 --> 02:09:50.990
<v Speaker 1>It used to be about some people used to </v>
<v Speaker 1>like to run it.</v>

2791
02:09:51.350 --> 02:09:53.110
<v Speaker 1>There's two things going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

2792
02:09:53.120 --> 02:09:58.120
<v Speaker 1>some people like to run it with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>graphics muted because they're video </v>

2793
02:09:58.120 --> 02:10:01.061
<v Speaker 1>card can handle the frames per second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The required to run it at like high </v>

2794
02:10:01.061 --> 02:10:04.361
<v Speaker 1>resolution with high frame rates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The higher frame rates make things more </v>

2795
02:10:04.361 --> 02:10:05.060
<v Speaker 1>smooth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you get,</v>

2796
02:10:05.090 --> 02:10:08.420
<v Speaker 1>they say the human eye can only see 30 </v>
<v Speaker 1>frame rates a second.</v>

2797
02:10:08.750 --> 02:10:13.750
<v Speaker 1>They need to update that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know for a fact they need to update </v>

2798
02:10:13.750 --> 02:10:15.650
<v Speaker 1>that because there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least maybe it doesn't apply,</v>

2799
02:10:15.680 --> 02:10:17.660
<v Speaker 1>I should say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to video games because there's something</v>

2800
02:10:17.661 --> 02:10:22.661
<v Speaker 1>that happens in video games when it goes</v>
<v Speaker 1>from 30 frames per second to 120 frames </v>

2801
02:10:23.091 --> 02:10:28.091
<v Speaker 1>per second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>plus it becomes far smoother and when </v>

2802
02:10:28.091 --> 02:10:30.470
<v Speaker 1>it's smoother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's less calculation as far as where</v>

2803
02:10:30.471 --> 02:10:34.190
<v Speaker 1>that person is at any given time because</v>
<v Speaker 1>though your mind</v>

2804
02:10:34.940 --> 02:10:37.430
<v Speaker 4>can't really say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2805
02:10:37.431 --> 02:10:42.410
<v Speaker 4>I see where there's a bunch of frames </v>
<v Speaker 4>that are rolling by and that's giving me</v>

2806
02:10:42.411 --> 02:10:45.980
<v Speaker 4>this illusion of movement and it's all </v>
<v Speaker 4>being calculated by a cpu.</v>

2807
02:10:46.160 --> 02:10:48.830
<v Speaker 4>Your brain doesn't really totally get </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

2808
02:10:48.831 --> 02:10:52.520
<v Speaker 4>but there's some amount of data that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>getting through when something.</v>

2809
02:10:52.560 --> 02:10:57.560
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of clunky.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's some amount of data that's </v>

2810
02:10:57.560 --> 02:10:57.560
<v Speaker 4>getting through that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2811
02:10:57.560 --> 02:11:00.641
<v Speaker 4>this is not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just gotta figure out where that </v>

2812
02:11:00.641 --> 02:11:00.641
<v Speaker 4>thing's going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this,</v>

2813
02:11:00.641 --> 02:11:01.970
<v Speaker 4>that thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's all like hickey.</v>

2814
02:11:02.150 --> 02:11:06.080
<v Speaker 4>It's a hiccupy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When it gets to 120 frames per second,</v>

2815
02:11:06.081 --> 02:11:08.450
<v Speaker 4>it's smooth as butter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then it starts looking like,</v>

2816
02:11:08.451 --> 02:11:09.500
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a cartoon.</v>

2817
02:11:09.740 --> 02:11:11.490
<v Speaker 4>Now I'm watching a cartoon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a cartoon,</v>

2818
02:11:11.491 --> 02:11:12.710
<v Speaker 4>and smooth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2819
02:11:12.711 --> 02:11:15.290
<v Speaker 4>A cartoon doesn't have anything to herky</v>
<v Speaker 4>jerky stuff to it,</v>

2820
02:11:15.500 --> 02:11:20.500
<v Speaker 4>and this is like a super smooth cartoon </v>
<v Speaker 4>like some of the video games you play </v>

2821
02:11:20.500 --> 02:11:21.500
<v Speaker 4>like unreal tournament.</v>

2822
02:11:21.500 --> 02:11:26.500
<v Speaker 4>Remember unreal Tournament,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get into high resolutions and each </v>

2823
02:11:26.500 --> 02:11:29.330
<v Speaker 4>the screams the players and she the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking laser beams shooting chunk,</v>

2824
02:11:29.331 --> 02:11:29.980
<v Speaker 4>chunk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>chunk,</v>

2825
02:11:29.990 --> 02:11:31.100
<v Speaker 4>chunk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy,</v>

2826
02:11:31.101 --> 02:11:32.090
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>

2827
02:11:32.780 --> 02:11:35.570
<v Speaker 4>And high frames per second.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very smooth.</v>

2828
02:11:35.780 --> 02:11:37.520
<v Speaker 4>It's really fun and interesting to </v>
<v Speaker 4>watch.</v>

2829
02:11:37.521 --> 02:11:41.460
<v Speaker 4>and when that happens your mind doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>have to calculate as much because it,</v>

2830
02:11:41.480 --> 02:11:43.100
<v Speaker 4>it's more predictable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

2831
02:11:43.101 --> 02:11:44.720
<v Speaker 4>it's smoother,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's more,</v>

2832
02:11:44.721 --> 02:11:46.640
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's more pleasing to the eyes,</v>

2833
02:11:46.850 --> 02:11:51.850
<v Speaker 4>but you're still dealing with all those </v>
<v Speaker 4>textures so that you're calculating </v>

2834
02:11:51.850 --> 02:11:51.980
<v Speaker 4>whether you like it or not or even know </v>
<v Speaker 4>it or not.</v>

2835
02:11:52.280 --> 02:11:56.900
<v Speaker 4>Every Time you pass by some gothic stone</v>
<v Speaker 4>wall and there's moss on it,</v>

2836
02:11:56.901 --> 02:12:01.901
<v Speaker 4>it's amazing looking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>your mind either has to deny the </v>

2837
02:12:01.901 --> 02:12:04.180
<v Speaker 4>existence of that or it has to calculate</v>
<v Speaker 4>that into what it's modeled.</v>

2838
02:12:04.190 --> 02:12:05.960
<v Speaker 4>The world is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's extra.</v>

2839
02:12:06.020 --> 02:12:08.930
<v Speaker 4>It's extra processing power.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's unnecessary.</v>

2840
02:12:09.110 --> 02:12:11.540
<v Speaker 4>So if the walls were all like the best </v>
<v Speaker 4>players,</v>

2841
02:12:11.541 --> 02:12:16.541
<v Speaker 4>what they would do is they would turn </v>
<v Speaker 4>all the textures off so they would only </v>

2842
02:12:16.541 --> 02:12:20.210
<v Speaker 4>have this like weird,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a tron world,</v>

2843
02:12:20.630 --> 02:12:25.630
<v Speaker 4>like with tron tron blew a fuse blew and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're in this strange virtual </v>

2844
02:12:25.731 --> 02:12:29.180
<v Speaker 4>environment or all the walls are flat </v>
<v Speaker 4>and matte white.</v>

2845
02:12:29.300 --> 02:12:29.490
<v Speaker 4>You.</v>

2846
02:12:30.920 --> 02:12:31.700
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

2847
02:12:31.740 --> 02:12:35.990
<v Speaker 6>it's something that I used to have to do</v>
<v Speaker 6>just to play in that game on my own.</v>

2848
02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:37.340
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my old computer.</v>

2849
02:12:38.420 --> 02:12:41.540
<v Speaker 6>But I think nowadays though,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think for the most part,</v>

2850
02:12:41.570 --> 02:12:46.570
<v Speaker 6>like a game like this should probably </v>
<v Speaker 6>run pretty perfectly on almost any </v>

2851
02:12:46.570 --> 02:12:48.530
<v Speaker 6>computer game right here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Has the shadows on.</v>

2852
02:12:48.830 --> 02:12:53.830
<v Speaker 6>But it has the textures off fine one </v>
<v Speaker 6>that has the shadows off too because </v>

2853
02:12:55.161 --> 02:12:59.690
<v Speaker 6>that happens to some crazy fuckers and </v>
<v Speaker 6>what might not be in quake three,</v>

2854
02:12:59.691 --> 02:13:04.691
<v Speaker 6>which I think that a quick live.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But I'm in the older games guys had </v>

2855
02:13:05.031 --> 02:13:08.060
<v Speaker 6>gotten it down to almost nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There was no shadow,</v>

2856
02:13:08.061 --> 02:13:13.061
<v Speaker 6>there was no nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Everything was like this weird </v>

2857
02:13:13.061 --> 02:13:15.710
<v Speaker 6>artificial environment.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you just started a textures off,</v>

2858
02:13:15.711 --> 02:13:19.330
<v Speaker 6>just like quick to react,</v>
<v Speaker 6>quick to um,</v>

2859
02:13:19.400 --> 02:13:23.360
<v Speaker 6>shadows off and textures often quick to </v>
<v Speaker 6>it might be a hack really.</v>

2860
02:13:23.361 --> 02:13:28.361
<v Speaker 6>It might not even necessarily be </v>
<v Speaker 6>something that I'm now that was in the </v>

2861
02:13:28.361 --> 02:13:28.361
<v Speaker 6>original settings.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I remember it.</v>

2862
02:13:28.361 --> 02:13:28.370
<v Speaker 6>Was it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2863
02:13:28.730 --> 02:13:30.590
<v Speaker 6>because it's all based on your graphics </v>
<v Speaker 6>card.</v>

2864
02:13:30.591 --> 02:13:32.370
<v Speaker 6>A lot of graphics cards couldn't handle </v>
<v Speaker 6>shadows</v>

2865
02:13:32.370 --> 02:13:33.570
<v Speaker 5>and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2866
02:13:33.571 --> 02:13:38.571
<v Speaker 5>But also in competition dudes figured </v>
<v Speaker 5>out pretty early on that it'd be easier </v>

2867
02:13:38.571 --> 02:13:38.820
<v Speaker 5>to hit people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There were the only things that you were</v>

2868
02:13:38.821 --> 02:13:40.590
<v Speaker 5>looking at?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2869
02:13:40.591 --> 02:13:43.290
<v Speaker 5>if I had to play like competitively,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I definitely shut everything off.</v>

2870
02:13:43.330 --> 02:13:45.990
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because it'll make you better cheating's</v>

2871
02:13:45.991 --> 02:13:50.991
<v Speaker 5>just like cutting weight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like cutting weight for video </v>

2872
02:13:50.991 --> 02:13:52.851
<v Speaker 5>games.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you used to play the old unreal </v>

2873
02:13:52.851 --> 02:13:52.851
<v Speaker 5>maps?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like the one in the bathroom?</v>

2874
02:13:52.851 --> 02:13:54.000
<v Speaker 5>We were sitting on top of the paper </v>
<v Speaker 5>roll.</v>

2875
02:13:54.080 --> 02:13:57.230
<v Speaker 5>I played that one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was unreal.</v>

2876
02:13:57.240 --> 02:13:58.620
<v Speaker 5>It was cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was cool.</v>

2877
02:13:58.650 --> 02:14:01.770
<v Speaker 5>It was like fans of quake made an </v>
<v Speaker 5>awesome game.</v>

2878
02:14:01.890 --> 02:14:03.240
<v Speaker 5>That's what it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2879
02:14:04.060 --> 02:14:07.290
<v Speaker 5>and plug.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was cool because didn't we get to see</v>

2880
02:14:07.291 --> 02:14:09.270
<v Speaker 5>unreal tournament before it even came </v>
<v Speaker 5>out?</v>

2881
02:14:10.080 --> 02:14:11.550
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We went to the studio.</v>

2882
02:14:11.551 --> 02:14:13.170
<v Speaker 5>I think it was unreal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was unreal.</v>

2883
02:14:13.200 --> 02:14:15.240
<v Speaker 5>It was one of the unreal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>eh.</v>

2884
02:14:15.390 --> 02:14:20.390
<v Speaker 5>One of the unreal releases.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm trying to remember which one it was </v>

2885
02:14:20.390 --> 02:14:22.440
<v Speaker 5>the first time we met cliff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cliff is so normal.</v>

2886
02:14:22.920 --> 02:14:24.290
<v Speaker 5>He's great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love cliff and he's.</v>

2887
02:14:24.330 --> 02:14:29.160
<v Speaker 5>He wouldn't think he'd be like some </v>
<v Speaker 5>super genius like video game creator.</v>

2888
02:14:29.370 --> 02:14:31.050
<v Speaker 5>He seems like such a normal dude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2889
02:14:31.051 --> 02:14:33.360
<v Speaker 5>totally.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you know his game by the way,</v>

2890
02:14:33.361 --> 02:14:37.290
<v Speaker 5>if one of his games just hit itunes </v>
<v Speaker 5>called shadow complex,</v>

2891
02:14:37.291 --> 02:14:39.420

<v Speaker 5>but now you can a phone,</v>

2892

2893
02:14:44.421 --> 02:14:44.421
<v Speaker 5>I think you could do it on the phone </v>
<v Speaker 5>too.</v>

2894
02:14:44.421 --> 02:14:45.810
<v Speaker 5>I just saw it the other day.</v>

<v Speaker 5>It's a like a side scroller like old </v>

<v Speaker 5>school kind of like where where you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>figuring out like puzzles and playing </v>

02:15:00.300 --> 02:15:02.860
<v Speaker 5>It's one of the best video games I've </v>

2904
02:15:13.601 --> 02:15:13.601
<v Speaker 5>couple of years ago when after he left,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2905
02:15:13.601 --> 02:15:13.850
<v Speaker 5>I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2906
02:15:14.040 --> 02:15:15.480
<v Speaker 5>he left epic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

2907
02:15:15.481 --> 02:15:18.360
<v Speaker 5>I'm so lucky I'm not a teenager today.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll get this.</v>

2908
02:15:18.361 --> 02:15:20.520
<v Speaker 5>Bullets are going under water.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would never get anything done.</v>

2909
02:15:20.880 --> 02:15:25.880
<v Speaker 5>I would get fucking nothing done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would have never gotten involved in </v>

2910
02:15:25.880 --> 02:15:25.880
<v Speaker 5>martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe I would've,</v>

2911
02:15:25.880 --> 02:15:28.320
<v Speaker 5>but I might not have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I might've just done this.</v>

2912
02:15:29.420 --> 02:15:31.170
<v Speaker 5>God damn.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I might've had more fun.</v>

2913
02:15:32.710 --> 02:15:37.710
<v Speaker 5>Might've been good at twitch then maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It just seems so fucking compelling.</v>

2914
02:15:39.090 --> 02:15:42.420
<v Speaker 5>When you watch these video games today,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're so goddamn compelling.</v>

2915
02:15:42.600 --> 02:15:47.600
<v Speaker 5>There's this new game that I just </v>
<v Speaker 5>finished that you can get for like 20 </v>

2916
02:15:47.600 --> 02:15:47.600
<v Speaker 5>bucks right now inside.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2917
02:15:48.540 --> 02:15:53.540
<v Speaker 5>But it's one of the best experiences of </v>
<v Speaker 5>video game I've ever had in my life was </v>

2918
02:15:54.350 --> 02:15:55.020
<v Speaker 5>the graphics.</v>

2919
02:15:55.050 --> 02:16:00.050
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like a puzzle kind of games and </v>

2920
02:16:00.050 --> 02:16:01.650
<v Speaker 5>game where you try to fIgure shit out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the ending and the fuel of the games</v>

2921
02:16:01.651 --> 02:16:02.010
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

2922
02:16:02.011 --> 02:16:02.430
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

2923
02:16:02.580 --> 02:16:06.930
<v Speaker 5>it's the field of game is some of the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>probably the one of the best video games</v>

2924
02:16:06.931 --> 02:16:10.860
<v Speaker 5>I've ever experienced in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's really hard.</v>

2925
02:16:10.890 --> 02:16:13.770
<v Speaker 5>Like there's words brian read.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's super cool.</v>

2926
02:16:13.771 --> 02:16:14.940
<v Speaker 5>I just played it too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

2927
02:16:14.970 --> 02:16:15.720
<v Speaker 5>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whoa,</v>

2928
02:16:15.721 --> 02:16:18.030
<v Speaker 5>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it doesn't tell you how to play.</v>

2929
02:16:18.040 --> 02:16:20.400
<v Speaker 5>There's no real.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just moving and jumping.</v>

2930
02:16:20.401 --> 02:16:21.690
<v Speaker 5>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't really need to.</v>

2931
02:16:21.840 --> 02:16:26.840
<v Speaker 5>There's no real strange controls.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But should we sell nothing off the for </v>

2932
02:16:27.820 --> 02:16:28.890
<v Speaker 5>anything?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's when the game.</v>

2933
02:16:28.960 --> 02:16:30.130
<v Speaker 5>It's not that long to play.</v>

2934
02:16:30.130 --> 02:16:31.990
<v Speaker 1>You can get through in a couple of hours</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're figuring it out,</v>

2935
02:16:31.991 --> 02:16:33.910
<v Speaker 1>but it'll take you longer if you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuck.</v>

2936
02:16:34.030 --> 02:16:39.030
<v Speaker 1>The ending is one of the most beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 1>pieces are our masterpieces of video </v>

2937
02:16:39.030 --> 02:16:40.210
<v Speaker 1>game I've ever seen in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2938

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2941
02:16:44.861 --> 02:16:47.470
<v Speaker 1>it's really fun with shadows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My god.</v>

2942
02:16:47.500 --> 02:16:50.200
<v Speaker 1>And this isn't even that crazy of </v>
<v Speaker 1>graphics.</v>

2943
02:16:50.201 --> 02:16:51.340
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

2944
02:16:51.430 --> 02:16:52.360
<v Speaker 1>it's done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

2945
02:16:52.390 --> 02:16:53.710
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good feeling.</v>

2946
02:16:53.740 --> 02:16:57.350
<v Speaker 1>Duncan trussell has the oculus rift and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he also has the vive.</v>

2947
02:16:57.430 --> 02:17:02.430
<v Speaker 1>The htc vive and he showed me this </v>
<v Speaker 1>archery game the other day and the htc </v>

2948
02:17:03.581 --> 02:17:05.890
<v Speaker 1>vive and I don't think I can have this </v>
<v Speaker 1>in my house.</v>

2949
02:17:06.130 --> 02:17:06.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can.</v>

2950
02:17:06.970 --> 02:17:07.870
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2951
02:17:07.871 --> 02:17:09.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I can have in the studio </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

2952
02:17:09.970 --> 02:17:12.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I could have it anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have.</v>

2953
02:17:12.460 --> 02:17:16.120
<v Speaker 1>I would have a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I played that fucking archery game until</v>

2954
02:17:16.121 --> 02:17:17.230
<v Speaker 1>my arms were shaking.</v>

2955
02:17:17.500 --> 02:17:22.500
<v Speaker 1>You're on the top of a castle and these </v>
<v Speaker 1>things are like charging at nacho and </v>

2956
02:17:23.051 --> 02:17:24.520
<v Speaker 1>shooting at them from the top of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>castle.</v>

2957
02:17:24.521 --> 02:17:26.610
<v Speaker 1>IT's super addictive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2958
02:17:26.710 --> 02:17:29.920
<v Speaker 1>Did you have a game called quiver?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just pulled this up when I was looking</v>

2959
02:17:29.921 --> 02:17:34.921
<v Speaker 1>for archery and divide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This looks like he's got a gang of </v>

2960
02:17:34.921 --> 02:17:37.681
<v Speaker 1>games,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this isn't the one that I played or </v>

2961
02:17:37.681 --> 02:17:38.710
<v Speaker 1>at least it's not the scene that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>played a lot of games,</v>

2962
02:17:38.711 --> 02:17:40.600
<v Speaker 1>but not good games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this is like,</v>

2963
02:17:40.610 --> 02:17:43.090
<v Speaker 1>like the graphics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This looks like a nintendo 64.</v>

2964
02:17:43.120 --> 02:17:45.520
<v Speaker 1>The graphics are not the best,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but seriously man,</v>

2965
02:17:45.521 --> 02:17:48.520
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to give a fuck when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>were in those goddamn htc vive.</v>

2966
02:17:48.521 --> 02:17:51.610
<v Speaker 1>Go goggles is the coolest shit in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

2967
02:17:51.850 --> 02:17:54.190
<v Speaker 1>You should get together with dunkin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to his house,</v>

2968
02:17:54.340 --> 02:17:56.360
<v Speaker 1>do his a podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2969
02:17:56.370 --> 02:17:58.690
<v Speaker 1>and play the vive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before you do it,</v>

2970
02:17:58.750 --> 02:18:00.010
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be blown away.</v>

2971
02:18:00.160 --> 02:18:01.090
<v Speaker 1>I have the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2972
02:18:01.190 --> 02:18:03.850
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cheap $30 one that you can buy where</v>

2973
02:18:03.851 --> 02:18:06.400
<v Speaker 1>you put your samsung phone in and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't do that.</v>

2974
02:18:06.900 --> 02:18:09.040
<v Speaker 1>This is the one I played.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the one I played.</v>

2975
02:18:09.100 --> 02:18:12.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these motherfuckers just vr archery.</v>

2976
02:18:12.600 --> 02:18:13.960
<v Speaker 1>You got to shoot at these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2977
02:18:14.500 --> 02:18:17.260
<v Speaker 1>these balloons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking real accurate.</v>

2978
02:18:17.261 --> 02:18:20.320
<v Speaker 1>That's what's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you just got to get a feel of which</v>

2979
02:18:20.321 --> 02:18:22.690
<v Speaker 1>way it's going and how fast it's going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

2980
02:18:22.691 --> 02:18:24.730
<v Speaker 1>like it has a certain amount of frames </v>
<v Speaker 1>per second,</v>

2981
02:18:25.670 --> 02:18:26.450
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2982
02:18:26.470 --> 02:18:28.450
<v Speaker 1>feet per second rather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the arrow,</v>

2983
02:18:28.630 --> 02:18:31.570
<v Speaker 1>you have to kind of lead them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you know they're jumping,</v>

2984
02:18:31.750 --> 02:18:33.940
<v Speaker 1>you have to figure out where they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be.</v>

2985
02:18:34.300 --> 02:18:36.210
<v Speaker 1>When the arrows get in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2986
02:18:36.220 --> 02:18:37.630
<v Speaker 1>if they're real close,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's easy,</v>

2987
02:18:37.631 --> 02:18:38.440
<v Speaker 1>like right there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bam.</v>

2988
02:18:38.441 --> 02:18:39.400
<v Speaker 1>It's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's right there.</v>

2989
02:18:39.610 --> 02:18:41.920
<v Speaker 1>But if they're moving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're moving left to right.</v>

2990
02:18:41.921 --> 02:18:44.570
<v Speaker 1>You kind of get a judgment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See how this guy is doing that.</v>

2991
02:18:44.590 --> 02:18:46.030
<v Speaker 1>He's figuring it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's leading them.</v>

2992
02:18:46.031 --> 02:18:46.960
<v Speaker 1>They're moving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bam.</v>

2993
02:18:47.080 --> 02:18:48.850
<v Speaker 1>They're running right into the arrows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>

2994
02:18:48.851 --> 02:18:53.851
<v Speaker 1>That's what I figured out how to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>after awhile and that gets super </v>

2995
02:18:53.851 --> 02:18:55.000
<v Speaker 1>addictive because it's really rewarding </v>
<v Speaker 1>because first of all,</v>

2996
02:18:55.001 --> 02:18:57.010
<v Speaker 1>you don't feel guilty at all because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not even people.</v>

2997
02:18:57.011 --> 02:19:02.011
<v Speaker 1>They're just total cartoons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Silhouettes With vikki helmets on and </v>

2998
02:19:02.011 --> 02:19:02.980
<v Speaker 1>shields,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you don't feel bad.</v>

2999
02:19:03.940 --> 02:19:04.510
<v Speaker 1>What happened here?</v>

3000
02:19:06.580 --> 02:19:08.440
<v Speaker 1>Is that the same thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what happened to the later?</v>

3001
02:19:08.441 --> 02:19:09.280
<v Speaker 1>Later?</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3002
02:19:09.750 --> 02:19:12.910
<v Speaker 1>They give you a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hilarious.</v>

3003
02:19:13.130 --> 02:19:14.140
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're so good.</v>

3004
02:19:14.290 --> 02:19:16.480
<v Speaker 1>You realize that it's stupid to have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bow and arrow here.</v>

3005
02:19:16.481 --> 02:19:17.530
<v Speaker 1>We'll give you a laser.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3006
02:19:17.531 --> 02:19:19.980
<v Speaker 1>they give you a laser radar later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Later,</v>

3007
02:19:20.050 --> 02:19:20.730
<v Speaker 1>later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>later,</v>

3008
02:19:20.750 --> 02:19:22.480
<v Speaker 1>later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The olympics.</v>

3009
02:19:22.481 --> 02:19:25.120
<v Speaker 1>Right now we're in this for samsung </v>
<v Speaker 1>devices.</v>

3010
02:19:25.390 --> 02:19:26.110
<v Speaker 1>They're in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>The porn though,</v>

3014
02:19:33.290 --> 02:19:34.340
<v Speaker 3>the no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did not.</v>

3015
02:19:34.370 --> 02:19:36.050
<v Speaker 3>Porn is what was going to choose</v>

3016
02:19:36.200 --> 02:19:41.200
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Duncan was too insistent that I do it </v>

3017
02:19:41.200 --> 02:19:41.200
<v Speaker 1>and I got nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got the fuck out of there.</v>

3018
02:19:41.600 --> 02:19:43.220
<v Speaker 1>I was Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to relax son.</v>

3019
02:19:43.550 --> 02:19:44.780

<v Speaker 1>make me nervous.</v>

3020
02:19:45.020 --> 02:19:46.070
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to have a gaga</v>

3021
02:19:46.220 --> 02:19:47.490
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you.</v>

3022
02:19:47.520 --> 02:19:51.290
<v Speaker 3>You got to watch the porn man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll sit over here.</v>

3023
02:19:51.530 --> 02:19:56.530
<v Speaker 3>You won't even see me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wanted to look at your lips when you </v>

3024
02:19:56.530 --> 02:19:59.120
<v Speaker 3>were watching it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Girl.</v>

3025
02:19:59.600 --> 02:20:01.240
<v Speaker 3>He probably snapchat the whole thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>while you.</v>

3026
02:20:01.241 --> 02:20:05.510
<v Speaker 3>You're playing anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did the porn.</v>

3027
02:20:05.720 --> 02:20:09.680
<v Speaker 3>The porn though really is something that</v>
<v Speaker 3>changes everything.</v>

3028
02:20:09.681 --> 02:20:12.650
<v Speaker 3>Like watching porn and that really like </v>
<v Speaker 3>you take it off and you're like,</v>

3029
02:20:12.651 --> 02:20:15.470
<v Speaker 3>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I felt closer to the girl than I thought</v>

3030
02:20:15.471 --> 02:20:16.680
<v Speaker 3>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

3031
02:20:16.880 --> 02:20:20.060
<v Speaker 3>that's going to save porn if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if this does catch on.</v>

3032
02:20:20.380 --> 02:20:25.380
<v Speaker 1>Well maybe because it'll make it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they can monetize the htc and the </v>

3033
02:20:25.420 --> 02:20:28.680
<v Speaker 1>oculus to the point where they can lock </v>
<v Speaker 1>down the format.</v>

3034
02:20:28.690 --> 02:20:30.430
<v Speaker 1>Like the way they have the iphone locked</v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

3035
02:20:30.610 --> 02:20:34.060
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't add anything to the app </v>
<v Speaker 1>store unless apple gives you approval if</v>

3036
02:20:34.061 --> 02:20:35.740
<v Speaker 1>they can control it and that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>same way.</v>

3037
02:20:35.890 --> 02:20:40.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying tHat's the best thing for</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody because I kinda liked the idea</v>

3038
02:20:40.450 --> 02:20:41.930
<v Speaker 1>of open source things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the,</v>

3039
02:20:42.610 --> 02:20:47.610
<v Speaker 1>I use a mac and I use it for convenience</v>
<v Speaker 1>and because I'm too busy I got have time</v>

3040
02:20:48.431 --> 02:20:53.431
<v Speaker 1>to fuck with some window shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but part of me likes the fact that </v>

3041
02:20:53.431 --> 02:20:55.090
<v Speaker 1>windows is open and I've heard that </v>
<v Speaker 1>argument before,</v>

3042
02:20:55.300 --> 02:20:57.550
<v Speaker 1>like I've had conversations with people </v>
<v Speaker 1>before with like,</v>

3043
02:20:57.551 --> 02:20:59.800
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody could write shit for windows.</v>

3044
02:20:59.930 --> 02:21:04.930
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you can make products that </v>

3045
02:21:04.930 --> 02:21:04.930
<v Speaker 1>work on windows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can make your own laptops,</v>

3046
02:21:04.930 --> 02:21:05.700
<v Speaker 1>you can put together your own desktops.</v>

3047
02:21:05.710 --> 02:21:08.740
<v Speaker 1>Like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a much more open sort of a platform</v>

3048
02:21:09.310 --> 02:21:13.030
<v Speaker 1>than mac is because mac is the software </v>
<v Speaker 1>developer and the hardware developer.</v>

3049
02:21:13.031 --> 02:21:15.790
<v Speaker 1>The good thing about that is everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>works pretty fucking good.</v>

3050
02:21:16.030 --> 02:21:20.830
<v Speaker 1>Like you get a laptop from apple pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking sure it's gonna work,</v>

3051
02:21:20.831 --> 02:21:21.850
<v Speaker 1>awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>etc.</v>

3052
02:21:21.920 --> 02:21:24.070
<v Speaker 1>And died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>

3053
02:21:24.420 --> 02:21:29.420
<v Speaker 1>Oh just stop working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we've had every Fucking computer </v>

3054
02:21:29.420 --> 02:21:29.420
<v Speaker 1>dies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Windows even,</v>

3055
02:21:29.530 --> 02:21:30.670
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all die.</v>

3056
02:21:31.600 --> 02:21:34.090
<v Speaker 1>What's my point?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My point is a point.</v>

3057
02:21:34.480 --> 02:21:39.480
<v Speaker 1>If I had a point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be that I'm taking it and </v>

3058
02:21:39.480 --> 02:21:44.011
<v Speaker 1>monetizing the applications that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>would use for the htc vive or oculus </v>

3059
02:21:44.410 --> 02:21:45.370
<v Speaker 1>only makes sense.</v>

3060
02:21:45.500 --> 02:21:47.150
<v Speaker 3>I thiNk what we're going to see though </v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

3061
02:21:47.151 --> 02:21:52.151
<v Speaker 3>especially when the xbox and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>playstation released their vr ca </v>

3062
02:21:52.151 --> 02:21:53.420
<v Speaker 3>counterpoints,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's when it's really going to</v>

3063
02:21:53.421 --> 02:21:57.770
<v Speaker 3>become an everyday thing and I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to hurt the,</v>

3064
02:21:58.100 --> 02:22:03.100
<v Speaker 3>the these kinds oF guys like the htcs </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the oculus people a lot because I </v>

3065
02:22:03.621 --> 02:22:06.620
<v Speaker 3>think it's going to be like computer </v>
<v Speaker 3>games and then,</v>

3066
02:22:06.621 --> 02:22:08.390
<v Speaker 3>oh hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is an x box.</v>

3067
02:22:08.391 --> 02:22:13.391
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that kind of killed pc gaming a lot and </v>

3068
02:22:13.391 --> 02:22:13.391
<v Speaker 3>a lot of a lot of ways.</v>

3069
02:22:13.391 --> 02:22:17.970
<v Speaker 1>I think there's going to be a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>copyright lawsuits for sure because </v>

3070
02:22:17.970 --> 02:22:20.971
<v Speaker 1>they're going to have to figure out who.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who invented the critical aspects for </v>

3071
02:22:21.600 --> 02:22:26.040
<v Speaker 1>like truly immersive virtual reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what</v>

3072
02:22:26.040 --> 02:22:28.410
<v Speaker 6>critical aspects are there?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Have they identified them?</v>

3073
02:22:28.650 --> 02:22:31.080
<v Speaker 6>Who invented those?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because those are huge.</v>

3074
02:22:31.410 --> 02:22:36.410
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if one guy figured out a way to make </v>

3075
02:22:36.410 --> 02:22:36.410
<v Speaker 6>this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the frame rate's incredibly smooth,</v>

3076
02:22:36.410 --> 02:22:40.551
<v Speaker 6>so there's no news,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no ability to discern when you moving </v>

3077
02:22:40.551 --> 02:22:40.551
<v Speaker 6>left to right,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whether you're moving fast or slow.</v>

3078
02:22:40.560 --> 02:22:45.560
<v Speaker 6>If one guy wrote some sort of a program </v>
<v Speaker 6>or figured out something that I would </v>

3079
02:22:45.560 --> 02:22:45.560
<v Speaker 6>imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not a lawyer obviously,</v>

3080
02:22:45.630 --> 02:22:47.940
<v Speaker 6>but I'd imagine there'd be some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 6>a case for that.</v>

3081
02:22:47.941 --> 02:22:52.941
<v Speaker 6>Like all these trolls,</v>
<v Speaker 6>patent trolls that apple gets hit with </v>

3082
02:22:52.941 --> 02:22:56.181
<v Speaker 6>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like I would imagine that that's going </v>

3083
02:22:56.181 --> 02:22:56.181
<v Speaker 6>to be crazy when it comes to this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3084
02:22:56.181 --> 02:22:58.740
<v Speaker 6>Unless It's already been licensed,</v>
<v Speaker 6>licensed it out,</v>

3085
02:22:58.741 --> 02:23:00.660
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it could be just some old guy going,</v>

3086
02:23:00.710 --> 02:23:02.220
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you'll give me $2,000,000</v>

3087
02:23:02.221 --> 02:23:02.640
<v Speaker 6>a year.</v>

3088
02:23:05.150 --> 02:23:10.150
<v Speaker 6>You might get brian's idea of commerce </v>
<v Speaker 6>is an episode or a fucking one of the,</v>

3089
02:23:14.071 --> 02:23:19.071
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>back to the future movies where like a </v>

3090
02:23:19.071 --> 02:23:23.060
<v Speaker 6>delorean and need some plutonium.</v>
<v Speaker 6>this guy just happens that I think </v>

3091
02:23:23.060 --> 02:23:23.060
<v Speaker 6>though,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think,</v>

3092
02:23:23.100 --> 02:23:25.020
<v Speaker 6>I think next year is when xbox is </v>
<v Speaker 6>releasing.</v>

3093
02:23:25.021 --> 02:23:30.021
<v Speaker 6>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think playstation's coming out this </v>

3094
02:23:30.021 --> 02:23:30.021
<v Speaker 6>year maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Maybe.</v>

3095
02:23:30.021 --> 02:23:30.021
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

3096
02:23:30.021 --> 02:23:30.690
<v Speaker 6>I don't think you can patent virtual </v>
<v Speaker 6>reality.</v>

3097
02:23:30.750 --> 02:23:33.780
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>lawnmower man was low as 1992.</v>

3098
02:23:33.840 --> 02:23:35.800
<v Speaker 6>What year was lawnmower man?</v>
<v Speaker 6>fInd that?</v>

3099
02:23:36.590 --> 02:23:40.710
<v Speaker 6>Let's guess.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would guess 1994.</v>

3100
02:23:40.770 --> 02:23:42.450
<v Speaker 6>Ninety four.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Ninety five.</v>

3101
02:23:42.900 --> 02:23:43.750
<v Speaker 6>I say nine.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Two,</v>

3102
02:23:44.360 --> 02:23:44.870
<v Speaker 6>nine,</v>
<v Speaker 6>two,</v>

3103
02:23:45.070 --> 02:23:46.520
<v Speaker 6>one.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

3104
02:23:47.400 --> 02:23:49.680
<v Speaker 6>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 6>complete total guests.</v>

3105
02:23:49.681 --> 02:23:51.330
<v Speaker 6>I had no idea it was right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

3106
02:23:51.331 --> 02:23:54.450
<v Speaker 6>But total recall is also a virtual </v>
<v Speaker 6>reality movie.</v>

3107
02:23:54.990 --> 02:23:57.270
<v Speaker 6>We watched the running man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

3108
02:23:57.271 --> 02:23:58.560
<v Speaker 6>that's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Horrible.</v>

3109
02:23:59.070 --> 02:24:02.160
<v Speaker 6>That did not have your childhood.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm telling you.</v>

3110
02:24:02.161 --> 02:24:04.050
<v Speaker 6>people were stupid as fuck back when we </v>
<v Speaker 6>were kids.</v>

3111
02:24:04.500 --> 02:24:06.780
<v Speaker 6>We didn't realize how dumb we were until</v>
<v Speaker 6>we watch old movies.</v>

3112
02:24:07.350 --> 02:24:11.390
<v Speaker 6>Was it was 1990 for a total recall.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Nineteen 90.</v>

3113
02:24:11.880 --> 02:24:13.230
<v Speaker 6>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Even earlier.</v>

3114
02:24:13.860 --> 02:24:14.890
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so those are those.</v>

3115
02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:18.450
<v Speaker 6>Those are vIrtual reality movies.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it's not like virtual reality is like</v>

3116
02:24:18.451 --> 02:24:23.040
<v Speaker 6>some thing that someone invented.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's really like a hope and a dream.</v>

3117
02:24:23.070 --> 02:24:28.070
<v Speaker 6>It's no waste to send a desert.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like everybody who lives a shitbag </v>

3118
02:24:28.070 --> 02:24:31.910
<v Speaker 6>life is hoping there's gotta be some way</v>
<v Speaker 6>that I can be superman told her recall </v>

3119
02:24:32.341 --> 02:24:37.341
<v Speaker 6>wasn't technically a virtual reality is </v>
<v Speaker 6>false memories being implanted in your </v>

3120
02:24:37.341 --> 02:24:40.830
<v Speaker 6>brain strain.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's why he's being danger days.</v>

3121
02:24:40.890 --> 02:24:44.010
<v Speaker 6>That's true,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's kind of that reality is kind of</v>

3122
02:24:44.040 --> 02:24:47.520
<v Speaker 6>virtual.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's creating an artificial memory.</v>

3123
02:24:47.521 --> 02:24:48.300
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're totally right.</v>

3124
02:24:48.540 --> 02:24:50.590
<v Speaker 6>it was an artificial memory movie.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3125
02:24:50.591 --> 02:24:52.590
<v Speaker 6>Strange days was a virtual reality </v>
<v Speaker 6>movie,</v>

3126
02:24:52.920 --> 02:24:54.240
<v Speaker 6>but there's been a few others.</v>
<v Speaker 6>RIght.</v>

3127
02:24:55.560 --> 02:24:57.450
<v Speaker 6>There's been a few others.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But um,</v>

3128
02:24:57.780 --> 02:24:59.460
<v Speaker 6>what do you think with the.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Was the big one?</v>

3129
02:24:59.490 --> 02:25:03.330
<v Speaker 6>What's the biggest one?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Virtual reality movie matrix.</v>

3130
02:25:03.500 --> 02:25:04.710
<v Speaker 6>The matrix.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3131
02:25:05.220 --> 02:25:06.240
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>of course.</v>

3132
02:25:06.270 --> 02:25:07.260
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't even think of that.</v>

3133
02:25:07.830 --> 02:25:08.970
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's the biggest.</v>

3134
02:25:09.300 --> 02:25:11.310
<v Speaker 6>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think anybody come along and say</v>

3135
02:25:11.311 --> 02:25:16.311
<v Speaker 6>they invented virtual reality,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like that's sort of like a whole.</v>

3136
02:25:16.670 --> 02:25:21.670
<v Speaker 6>It's like a horn blowing in the distance</v>
<v Speaker 6>that we all knew it was coming and it's </v>

3137
02:25:21.670 --> 02:25:22.500
<v Speaker 6>not even like if even if you look at </v>
<v Speaker 6>video games,</v>

3138
02:25:22.501 --> 02:25:24.220
<v Speaker 6>you can say video games are virtual </v>
<v Speaker 6>reality.</v>

3139
02:25:24.220 --> 02:25:26.080
<v Speaker 5>Just very bad versIons of him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3140
02:25:26.081 --> 02:25:27.790
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like super mario brothers.</v>

3141
02:25:27.791 --> 02:25:32.791
<v Speaker 5>That's a virtual reality of a plumber.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is this virtual reality is coming </v>

3142
02:25:33.341 --> 02:25:38.341
<v Speaker 5>to your movie theater near you ends.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've heard a lot of people talk about </v>

3143
02:25:38.341 --> 02:25:39.140
<v Speaker 5>this as a pretty cool movie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think I've ever seen or heard of</v>

3144
02:25:39.400 --> 02:25:41.230
<v Speaker 5>1999.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think jude law's in it.</v>

3145
02:25:41.320 --> 02:25:42.670
<v Speaker 5>That's a name of a boner pill.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jennifer.</v>

3146
02:25:42.671 --> 02:25:44.330
<v Speaker 5>Jason leigh.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mmm.</v>

3147
02:25:45.590 --> 02:25:46.780
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't speak on it,</v>

3148
02:25:46.781 --> 02:25:51.781
<v Speaker 5>but I've heard a lot of people said that</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was like an under the radar kind of </v>

3149
02:25:51.781 --> 02:25:52.150
<v Speaker 5>good movie came out in 1999,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is the same year.</v>

3150
02:25:52.151 --> 02:25:54.640
<v Speaker 5>the matrix came out probably.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why no one heard about it.</v>

3151
02:25:55.060 --> 02:26:00.060
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's supposed to be a good mom is a </v>

3152
02:26:00.060 --> 02:26:02.910
<v Speaker 1>three and a half stars is that three and</v>
<v Speaker 1>a quarter stars for three and a half to </v>

3153
02:26:02.910 --> 02:26:05.881
<v Speaker 1>eight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A 71 fucking rotten tomatoes star </v>

3154
02:26:05.881 --> 02:26:08.200
<v Speaker 1>search.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We covered in empire of allies.</v>

3155
02:26:09.030 --> 02:26:09.380
<v Speaker 8>[inaudible]</v>

3156
02:26:10.880 --> 02:26:15.880
<v Speaker 1>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the corporation realizes the </v>

3157
02:26:15.880 --> 02:26:18.581
<v Speaker 1>benefit isn't telling the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>THe way to make the money is not to </v>

3158
02:26:18.581 --> 02:26:23.110
<v Speaker 1>create bad reviews are fake reviews.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The money is in being brutally honest </v>

3159
02:26:25.730 --> 02:26:30.730
<v Speaker 1>and reaping the rewards of people coming</v>
<v Speaker 1>to read these really country review.</v>

3160
02:26:33.490 --> 02:26:37.540
<v Speaker 5>That's why I get my news and information</v>
<v Speaker 5>from only hashtags nowadays.</v>

3161
02:26:37.600 --> 02:26:38.390
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's good marriage.</v>

3162
02:26:38.950 --> 02:26:41.440
<v Speaker 5>You do that like every time there's any </v>
<v Speaker 5>helicopter in burbank.</v>

3163
02:26:41.441 --> 02:26:43.330
<v Speaker 5>I'm like hashtag burbank and like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's going on?</v>

3164

<v Speaker 5>wake up,</v>

3165
02:26:44.861 --> 02:26:49.861
<v Speaker 5>I go hashtag apocalypse.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See what's the most recent post I'm </v>

3166
02:26:49.861 --> 02:26:53.410
<v Speaker 5>going to go back to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I go outside and shoot my rubber elk.</v>

3167
02:26:53.470 --> 02:26:54.940
<v Speaker 5>It's more Fast.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Inaccurate though.</v>

3168
02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:58.210
<v Speaker 5>It's usually one guy going dude or the </v>
<v Speaker 5>helicopter down on the street.</v>

3169
02:26:58.420 --> 02:26:59.710
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's definitely some shit</v>

3170
02:26:59.740 --> 02:27:04.740
<v Speaker 1>going down in these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you follow like social media </v>

3171
02:27:04.740 --> 02:27:07.720
<v Speaker 1>news feeds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like people that are on the scene,</v>

3172
02:27:07.721 --> 02:27:10.480
<v Speaker 1>they're talking about some cops shooting</v>
<v Speaker 1>some kid or something like that.</v>

3173
02:27:10.481 --> 02:27:13.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's one of the best ways to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get some data.</v>

3174
02:27:13.960 --> 02:27:16.180
<v Speaker 1>The question is the veracity of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>data,</v>

3175
02:27:16.210 --> 02:27:18.760
<v Speaker 1>like whether or not it's god damn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sound like a professor.</v>

3176
02:27:19.190 --> 02:27:24.190
<v Speaker 1>I need to apply for a job somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Teaching the voracity of the data must </v>

3177
02:27:24.190 --> 02:27:27.520
<v Speaker 1>come into question the biases of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

3178
02:27:27.521 --> 02:27:29.650
<v Speaker 1>Did you go to their twitter page?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are they into?</v>

3179
02:27:29.680 --> 02:27:33.070
<v Speaker 1>How many noam chomsky books of the road?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you sure they're right?</v>

3180
02:27:34.250 --> 02:27:34.610
<v Speaker 8>Right?</v>

3181
02:27:36.010 --> 02:27:38.590
<v Speaker 1>You never know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you could find out some shit's going</v>

3182
02:27:38.591 --> 02:27:39.790
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like a.</v>

3183
02:27:39.791 --> 02:27:44.791
<v Speaker 1>There was a video of the dallas shootout</v>
<v Speaker 1>between the guy and the cops,</v>

3184
02:27:44.860 --> 02:27:45.240
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3185
02:27:45.241 --> 02:27:48.100
<v Speaker 1>the former military guy who killed all </v>
<v Speaker 1>those fucking cops.</v>

3186
02:27:49.800 --> 02:27:49.970
<v Speaker 8>Hmm.</v>

3187
02:27:50.930 --> 02:27:53.290
<v Speaker 1>Whew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a tough video to watch,</v>

3188
02:27:53.291 --> 02:27:54.700
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's this one scene.</v>

3189
02:27:55.210 --> 02:27:58.210
<v Speaker 1>I think it was him that did it or </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone else who shot someone else.</v>

3190
02:27:58.211 --> 02:28:03.211
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's all I saw a person was running </v>

3191
02:28:03.211 --> 02:28:04.540
<v Speaker 1>down the street and a person in this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

3192
02:28:04.541 --> 02:28:09.541
<v Speaker 1>these two people involved in a gunfight </v>
<v Speaker 1>and one guy shot behind the guy and hit </v>

3193
02:28:11.741 --> 02:28:16.741
<v Speaker 1>the wall behind them and then use that </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a distraction to run in front of him </v>

3194
02:28:16.871 --> 02:28:18.790
<v Speaker 1>and shoot him when he's laying down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3195
02:28:18.791 --> 02:28:20.950
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was.</v>

3196
02:28:21.140 --> 02:28:22.310
<v Speaker 1>That guy has done</v>

3197
02:28:22.310 --> 02:28:26.390
<v Speaker 5>this before games.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I hate this.</v>

<v Speaker 5>in this case,</v>

3200
02:28:30.831 --> 02:28:32.900
<v Speaker 5>if it's the same guy who killed all </v>
<v Speaker 5>those people,</v>

3201
02:28:33.200 --> 02:28:35.750
<v Speaker 5>it's a guy who was in war in the first </v>
<v Speaker 5>place.</v>

3202
02:28:35.751 --> 02:28:37.700
<v Speaker 5>So we'd actually play the ultimate video</v>
<v Speaker 5>game.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Here's some,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some crazy shit.</v>

3319
02:34:06.180 --> 02:34:11.180
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>did you know that like if someone's </v>

3320
02:34:11.180 --> 02:34:13.380
<v Speaker 5>allergic to horses they can't even ride </v>
<v Speaker 5>in a carriage behind a horse.</v>

3321
02:34:13.620 --> 02:34:14.520
<v Speaker 5>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3322
02:34:14.910 --> 02:34:16.620
<v Speaker 5>And I was thinking of this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3323
02:34:16.650 --> 02:34:18.040
<v Speaker 5>women,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some women</v>

3324
02:34:18.160 --> 02:34:21.250
<v Speaker 6>are literally allergic to their man's </v>
<v Speaker 6>come,</v>

3325
02:34:22.600 --> 02:34:25.360
<v Speaker 6>like the guy shoots loads on them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They get rashes all over their body.</v>

3326
02:34:25.361 --> 02:34:26.350
<v Speaker 6>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

3327
02:34:29.930 --> 02:34:32.140
<v Speaker 6>like literally some demonic shit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

3328
02:34:32.530 --> 02:34:36.250
<v Speaker 6>like a guy shoots a load on you and like</v>
<v Speaker 6>carved his name,</v>

3329
02:34:36.880 --> 02:34:41.880
<v Speaker 6>takes his load and writes it with his </v>
<v Speaker 6>finger and just leaves you there to dry </v>

3330
02:34:41.880 --> 02:34:42.700
<v Speaker 6>and you have the mark of the demon and </v>
<v Speaker 6>stomach.</v>

3331
02:34:43.090 --> 02:34:47.020
<v Speaker 6>Is that because of food allergies that </v>
<v Speaker 6>maybe that's inside the come?</v>

3332
02:34:47.021 --> 02:34:52.021
<v Speaker 6>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Maybe he or she is allergic to peanuts </v>

3333
02:34:52.021 --> 02:34:52.990
<v Speaker 6>and he just eats nonstop peanuts and she</v>
<v Speaker 6>does a very good question.</v>

3334
02:34:53.260 --> 02:34:55.060
<v Speaker 6>It's probably something like that could </v>
<v Speaker 6>be.</v>

3335
02:34:55.510 --> 02:34:58.630
<v Speaker 6>I'm wondering what it meant.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wonder if there's a reason jamie,</v>

3336
02:34:59.200 --> 02:35:04.200
<v Speaker 6>research that find out what makes come </v>
<v Speaker 6>allergenic and uh,</v>

3337
02:35:08.110 --> 02:35:11.380
<v Speaker 6>feel free to deduct any research from </v>
<v Speaker 6>your taxes.</v>

3338
02:35:11.440 --> 02:35:14.740
<v Speaker 6>I know like some,</v>
<v Speaker 6>some girls do that ph balance just,</v>

3339
02:35:14.741 --> 02:35:16.720
<v Speaker 6>it's totally different from you or </v>
<v Speaker 6>whatever.</v>

3340
02:35:16.720 --> 02:35:21.720
<v Speaker 6>And they break out or to of this is </v>
<v Speaker 6>saying she was dosed with diagnosed with</v>

3341
02:35:21.941 --> 02:35:26.220
<v Speaker 6>human seminal plasma hypersensitivity </v>
<v Speaker 6>and allergy to seaman.</v>

3342
02:35:26.560 --> 02:35:31.560
<v Speaker 6>The problem with guessing that is we </v>
<v Speaker 6>don't know how many different people </v>

3343
02:35:31.871 --> 02:35:36.871
<v Speaker 6>came on her and within it wasn't not at </v>
<v Speaker 6>all had the same effect.</v>

3344
02:35:37.511 --> 02:35:42.511
<v Speaker 6>And what's the pe ratio to do a double </v>
<v Speaker 6>blind placebo controlled gang.</v>

3345
02:35:43.570 --> 02:35:44.800
<v Speaker 6>Not gang bang,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but like,</v>

3346
02:35:44.801 --> 02:35:46.060
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what would it be?</v>

3347
02:35:46.070 --> 02:35:49.480
<v Speaker 6>A bunch of users jerked off on a girl </v>
<v Speaker 6>circle jerk.</v>

3348
02:35:50.280 --> 02:35:53.200
<v Speaker 6>there's a little peon come right circle </v>
<v Speaker 6>jerk involves a cracker though.</v>

3349
02:35:53.201 --> 02:35:56.390
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like an official sort of sloppy biscuit.</v>

3350
02:35:57.490 --> 02:36:02.490
<v Speaker 6>Loves that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I always thought that a circle jerk </v>

3351
02:36:02.490 --> 02:36:04.590
<v Speaker 6>involved.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just a bunch of dudes jerking off </v>

3352
02:36:04.590 --> 02:36:04.590
<v Speaker 6>together,</v>

<v Speaker 6>come just to eat the cracker.</v>

<v Speaker 6>What kind of a fucking world are we </v>
<v Speaker 6>inventing?</v>

<v Speaker 6>those crackers come?</v>

<v Speaker 13>Don't get in the game looking.</v>

3448

<v Speaker 13>they but fuck you.</v>

3449
02:40:46.700 --> 02:40:50.610
<v Speaker 13>And they picked the same cross up here </v>
<v Speaker 13>and then you know what I'm saying?</v>

3450
02:40:50.640 --> 02:40:52.920
<v Speaker 13>You can't come back from that.</v>
<v Speaker 13>You can't recover from that.</v>

3451
02:40:52.921 --> 02:40:54.360
<v Speaker 13>I'm not fucking laughing here.</v>

3452
02:41:03.150 --> 02:41:04.260
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I have.</v>

3453
02:41:05.880 --> 02:41:06.250
<v Speaker 13>Okay.</v>

3454
02:41:12.070 --> 02:41:15.610
<v Speaker 5>And I remember going when at that time </v>
<v Speaker 5>of that period of time,</v>

3455
02:41:15.611 --> 02:41:18.460
<v Speaker 5>like me and duncan,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would always go to his friend's house,</v>

3456
02:41:18.880 --> 02:41:23.880
<v Speaker 5>that guy and you'd get these houses.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was like people that believed in st.</v>

3457
02:41:24.610 --> 02:41:27.430
<v Speaker 5>Maybe not seriously or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I remember going,</v>

3458
02:41:27.431 --> 02:41:28.600
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dunkin is.</v>

3459
02:41:28.601 --> 02:41:32.020
<v Speaker 5>It's some deep shit to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dunkin was always,</v>

3460
02:41:32.021 --> 02:41:33.520
<v Speaker 5>I think a joke,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it was.</v>

3461
02:41:33.640 --> 02:41:36.970
<v Speaker 5>We were hanging out with really intense </v>
<v Speaker 5>tense people,</v>

3462
02:41:36.971 --> 02:41:37.660
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like.</v>

3463
02:41:37.770 --> 02:41:39.070
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>super intense.</v>

3464
02:41:39.190 --> 02:41:40.210
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

3465
02:41:40.211 --> 02:41:45.211
<v Speaker 5>Well duncan's into intense humans and </v>
<v Speaker 5>intense ideas and for awhile he was </v>

3466
02:41:45.211 --> 02:41:49.590
<v Speaker 5>really attracted to this idea not of </v>
<v Speaker 5>satanism in that satan is an actual </v>

3467
02:41:49.590 --> 02:41:52.570
<v Speaker 5>being in the devil is real and that </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're praying to the devil,</v>

3468
02:41:52.870 --> 02:41:56.050
<v Speaker 5>but satanism in that these people were </v>
<v Speaker 5>like essentially hedonist.</v>

3469
02:41:56.080 --> 02:42:01.080
<v Speaker 5>They were just like seeking pleasure and</v>
<v Speaker 5>trying to have as much fun as they </v>

3470
02:42:01.080 --> 02:42:01.080
<v Speaker 5>could,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they were also allowing other people</v>

3471
02:42:01.080 --> 02:42:03.940
<v Speaker 5>to do it too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you like redefining what satanism is</v>

3472
02:42:04.640 --> 02:42:05.130
<v Speaker 4>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3473
02:42:05.131 --> 02:42:10.131
<v Speaker 4>if that's okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the problem with all ideologies </v>

3474
02:42:10.131 --> 02:42:11.640
<v Speaker 4>like you're locked into,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you want to call it satanism and it's</v>

3475
02:42:11.641 --> 02:42:12.300
<v Speaker 4>all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey man,</v>

3476
02:42:12.301 --> 02:42:14.840
<v Speaker 4>just be free.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just have a good time and you know,</v>

3477
02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:18.420
<v Speaker 4>just fucking do whatever feels good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Terrible.</v>

3478
02:42:18.421 --> 02:42:23.421
<v Speaker 4>Don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But there's a big difference between </v>

3479
02:42:23.421 --> 02:42:23.421
<v Speaker 4>that in and of itself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is an awesome idea,</v>

3480
02:42:23.430 --> 02:42:25.320
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like everybody agrees like you should.</v>

3481
02:42:25.321 --> 02:42:26.100
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have fun,</v>

3482
02:42:26.101 --> 02:42:31.101
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're only here for a little bit at a </v>

3483
02:42:31.101 --> 02:42:31.101
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you get your toes sucked,</v>

3484
02:42:31.101 --> 02:42:33.210
<v Speaker 4>fucking get your toe socks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who cares,</v>

3485
02:42:33.270 --> 02:42:38.270
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there is a big fucking difference </v>

3486
02:42:38.270 --> 02:42:39.960
<v Speaker 4>between that and something that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>connected to a demon.</v>

3487
02:42:40.400 --> 02:42:43.290
<v Speaker 4>It's connected to a fallen angel who </v>
<v Speaker 4>became a devil,</v>

3488
02:42:43.470 --> 02:42:48.470
<v Speaker 4>who lives in us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a smoldering inferno in the middle of </v>

3489
02:42:48.470 --> 02:42:51.801
<v Speaker 4>the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and if he gets a hold of you and you </v>

3490
02:42:51.801 --> 02:42:52.620
<v Speaker 4>don't listen to god,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you will burn to the end of the time.</v>

3491
02:42:53.720 --> 02:42:55.950
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are you retarded?</v>

3492
02:42:56.250 --> 02:42:57.540
<v Speaker 4>Why does it have to be connected to </v>
<v Speaker 4>that?</v>

3493
02:42:57.740 --> 02:43:01.150
<v Speaker 5>Why is that good feeling and having a </v>
<v Speaker 5>good time and pleasure and</v>

3494
02:43:01.500 --> 02:43:04.840
<v Speaker 4>being a whole bag if that's what you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>into.</v>

3495
02:43:04.860 --> 02:43:06.630
<v Speaker 4>If you're a girl you like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're in dental,</v>

3496
02:43:06.631 --> 02:43:09.570
<v Speaker 4>floss up your ass and going out to bars </v>
<v Speaker 4>and sucking three dicks.</v>

3497
02:43:09.660 --> 02:43:11.470
<v Speaker 4>Who cares?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3498
02:43:11.710 --> 02:43:12.010
<v Speaker 4>Why does it</v>

3499
02:43:12.010 --> 02:43:14.230
<v Speaker 1>have to be connected to the devil?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that's a sin.</v>

3500
02:43:14.380 --> 02:43:18.510
<v Speaker 1>All those are synced to enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian red band.</v>

3501
02:43:19.300 --> 02:43:24.100
<v Speaker 1>I forsake v enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Enough with these fuckers.</v>

3502
02:43:24.670 --> 02:43:25.930
<v Speaker 7>One last little thing I want to show </v>
<v Speaker 7>you.</v>

3503
02:43:25.931 --> 02:43:28.720
<v Speaker 7>I have you seen this new game maybe or </v>
<v Speaker 7>may not have.</v>

3504
02:43:28.721 --> 02:43:30.830
<v Speaker 7>It's called no man's sky.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Whoops.</v>

3505
02:43:30.960 --> 02:43:33.700
<v Speaker 7>What's really interesting about it is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>as far as I understand,</v>

3506
02:43:33.770 --> 02:43:36.150
<v Speaker 7>I'm been trying to figure it out,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the uh,</v>

3507
02:43:36.690 --> 02:43:41.690
<v Speaker 7>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's an unexplored space and if there's </v>

3508
02:43:41.690 --> 02:43:46.080
<v Speaker 7>something like 10 billion planets that </v>
<v Speaker 7>are being populated in this multiplayer </v>

3509
02:43:46.080 --> 02:43:47.650
<v Speaker 7>universe,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and as a player,</v>

3510
02:43:47.651 --> 02:43:51.550
<v Speaker 7>what you're supposed to do is go and </v>
<v Speaker 7>explore and find species and planets.</v>

3511
02:43:51.610 --> 02:43:56.610
<v Speaker 7>Hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Can you say 10 billion planets in the </v>

3512
02:43:56.610 --> 02:43:57.970
<v Speaker 7>first 24 hours or two days?</v>
<v Speaker 7>This was up.</v>

3513
02:43:57.971 --> 02:44:01.570
<v Speaker 7>They've already named more species in </v>
<v Speaker 7>this game than there are on earth.</v>

3514
02:44:01.920 --> 02:44:02.250
<v Speaker 7>It.</v>
<v Speaker 7>See?</v>

3515
02:44:02.330 --> 02:44:04.660
<v Speaker 7>It's all computer generated.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So when you play the game,</v>

3516
02:44:04.661 --> 02:44:08.290
<v Speaker 7>it automatically generates a planet.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So it's just random random shit.</v>

3517
02:44:08.380 --> 02:44:09.370
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I get that.</v>

3518
02:44:09.371 --> 02:44:10.840
<v Speaker 7>But what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Say that again?</v>

3519
02:44:10.841 --> 02:44:13.840
<v Speaker 7>It's more species in this game and how </v>
<v Speaker 7>many days,</v>

3520
02:44:13.930 --> 02:44:18.050
<v Speaker 7>and I'll look up that article that says </v>
<v Speaker 7>more than more speed,</v>

3521
02:44:18.730 --> 02:44:23.730
<v Speaker 7>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the reviews of this game is pretty </v>

3522
02:44:23.730 --> 02:44:24.190
<v Speaker 7>boring.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh my god.</v>

3523
02:44:24.220 --> 02:44:25.990
<v Speaker 7>It's just a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's a little slower of a game.</v>

3524
02:44:25.991 --> 02:44:28.750
<v Speaker 7>It's not like a first person shooter.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's not that typical kind of game,</v>

3525
02:44:28.751 --> 02:44:31.330
<v Speaker 7>but it's supposedly a truly open </v>
<v Speaker 7>universe.</v>

3526
02:44:31.331 --> 02:44:36.331
<v Speaker 7>And the game just came out this week.</v>
<v Speaker 7>A lot of people have been really </v>

3527
02:44:36.331 --> 02:44:36.331
<v Speaker 7>anticipating it for like the last couple</v>
<v Speaker 7>months.</v>

3528
02:44:36.331 --> 02:44:39.050
<v Speaker 1>So is this game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it says truly open universe.</v>

3529
02:44:39.170 --> 02:44:42.380
<v Speaker 1>So is this game constantly inventing </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself on the fly?</v>

3530
02:44:43.240 --> 02:44:47.330
<v Speaker 1>Oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sort of like real dude.</v>

3531
02:44:47.340 --> 02:44:52.340
<v Speaker 1>Do you have any idea what it's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be like when that's on the htc vive and </v>

3532
02:44:52.340 --> 02:44:53.570
<v Speaker 1>we're not in 2016,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when they're in 2000,</v>

3533
02:44:53.571 --> 02:44:57.440
<v Speaker 1>67,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were living in another world man.</v>

3534
02:44:57.710 --> 02:45:02.710
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in one night we hit 10 million species </v>

3535
02:45:02.710 --> 02:45:06.251
<v Speaker 1>discovered in mms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's more than has been discovered on </v>

3536
02:45:06.251 --> 02:45:08.330
<v Speaker 1>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is going on?</v>

3537
02:45:09.200 --> 02:45:12.380
<v Speaker 1>It is a testament to how amazing our </v>
<v Speaker 1>network coders are.</v>

3538
02:45:12.560 --> 02:45:14.630
<v Speaker 1>That discoveries are still working at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

3539
02:45:14.780 --> 02:45:17.630
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is yesterday.</v>

3540
02:45:19.030 --> 02:45:20.720
<v Speaker 1>We're already in a simulation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>joe.</v>

3541
02:45:21.320 --> 02:45:23.430
<v Speaker 1>It is for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3542
02:45:23.431 --> 02:45:28.340
<v Speaker 1>it's like that's a simulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's not the best one,</v>

3543
02:45:28.580 --> 02:45:32.090
<v Speaker 1>but it's like taking a motorola startac.</v>
<v Speaker 1>IF someone says,</v>

3544
02:45:32.091 --> 02:45:33.080
<v Speaker 1>do you have a cell phone?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>

3545
02:45:33.081 --> 02:45:33.710
<v Speaker 1>yes I do.</v>

3546
02:45:33.740 --> 02:45:36.710
<v Speaker 1>And you pull out a motorola startac like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's on a fucking cell phone.</v>

3547
02:45:36.920 --> 02:45:39.170
<v Speaker 1>But it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just not a good one.</v>

3548
02:45:39.850 --> 02:45:41.870
<v Speaker 1>Like are we already in the simulation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3549
02:45:41.930 --> 02:45:43.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's already happened.</v>

3550
02:45:43.011 --> 02:45:45.740
<v Speaker 1>It's just not good yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You kind of know it's there,</v>

3551
02:45:46.370 --> 02:45:51.370
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely a simulation and it's </v>

3552
02:45:51.370 --> 02:45:53.060
<v Speaker 1>getting way weirder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's getting way weirder.</v>

3553
02:45:54.170 --> 02:45:59.170
<v Speaker 1>I feel like when I pay attention to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>news and I paid attention to the </v>

3554
02:45:59.170 --> 02:46:04.031
<v Speaker 1>internet and I just stepped back and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll look at this crazy trump clinton </v>

3555
02:46:05.331 --> 02:46:10.331
<v Speaker 1>race and I look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is bizarre,</v>

3556
02:46:10.600 --> 02:46:14.860
<v Speaker 5>strange world that we find ourselves </v>
<v Speaker 5>sorta like waking up in.</v>

3557
02:46:17.760 --> 02:46:21.570
<v Speaker 5>I can only imagine how fucking weird </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's going to be in a decade.</v>

3558
02:46:22.890 --> 02:46:27.890
<v Speaker 5>I can only imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We should really consider getting water </v>

3559
02:46:29.160 --> 02:46:32.700
<v Speaker 5>and shelter and figuring out how to get </v>
<v Speaker 5>solar power.</v>

3560
02:46:32.701 --> 02:46:36.980
<v Speaker 5>We can get this kid really fall apart.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That guy in Virginia does that.</v>

3561
02:46:37.590 --> 02:46:39.960
<v Speaker 5>They took away as the land.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What guy?</v>

3562
02:46:39.980 --> 02:46:41.360
<v Speaker 5>There's this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it was Virginia.</v>

3563
02:46:41.400 --> 02:46:44.550
<v Speaker 5>They took away his land because he was </v>
<v Speaker 5>off the grid,</v>

3564
02:46:44.580 --> 02:46:49.350
<v Speaker 5>like he did everything off the grid,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so he was not paying any city utility at</v>

3565
02:46:49.351 --> 02:46:54.351
<v Speaker 5>all and they didn't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they just took his land away from </v>

3566
02:46:54.351 --> 02:46:54.351
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Which guys?</v>

3567
02:46:54.351 --> 02:46:56.010
<v Speaker 5>This uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you google image was on the news,</v>

3568
02:46:56.520 --> 02:47:01.520
<v Speaker 5>Virginia homeowner fighting to keep </v>
<v Speaker 5>property from being taken away by </v>

3569
02:47:01.520 --> 02:47:01.520
<v Speaker 5>eminent domain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3570
02:47:01.520 --> 02:47:06.470
<v Speaker 5>I think that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just putting him in that domain is </v>

3571
02:47:06.470 --> 02:47:07.170
<v Speaker 5>different than when a company gets from </v>
<v Speaker 5>february.</v>

3572
02:47:07.940 --> 02:47:10.050
<v Speaker 5>It's old shit bro.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just too new.</v>

3573
02:47:10.100 --> 02:47:15.100
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Domain is scary because I'm going a </v>

3574
02:47:15.100 --> 02:47:15.100
<v Speaker 5>domain is like if they're trying to put </v>
<v Speaker 5>a highway through something,</v>

3575
02:47:15.100 --> 02:47:18.010
<v Speaker 5>they can just buy your house.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have to move a put,</v>

3576
02:47:18.690 --> 02:47:23.690
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you see those houses that are like </v>

3577
02:47:23.690 --> 02:47:23.690
<v Speaker 5>on the side of the four,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh five.</v>

3578
02:47:23.690 --> 02:47:25.020
<v Speaker 5>They're doomed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Doomed.</v>

3579
02:47:25.530 --> 02:47:30.530
<v Speaker 5>They're going to spread that bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't keep all these fucking people </v>

3580
02:47:30.530 --> 02:47:30.530
<v Speaker 5>together.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just not working.</v>

3581
02:47:30.600 --> 02:47:33.280
<v Speaker 5>There's too many of us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Unless everybody gets automatic cars,</v>

3582
02:47:33.281 --> 02:47:38.281
<v Speaker 5>there's no more accidents.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And even then we're going to realize </v>

3583
02:47:38.281 --> 02:47:40.971
<v Speaker 5>what a bottleneck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just the sheer volume of humans there </v>

3584
02:47:40.971 --> 02:47:43.491
<v Speaker 5>are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm pretty sure that's what's going to </v>

3585
02:47:43.491 --> 02:47:44.841
<v Speaker 5>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like even as China just released their </v>

3586
02:47:44.841 --> 02:47:44.841
<v Speaker 5>first neW bus</v>

3587
02:47:44.841 --> 02:47:44.841
<v Speaker 12>cars</v>

3588
02:47:44.841 --> 02:47:48.960
<v Speaker 5>underneath the bus and I'm going to have</v>
<v Speaker 5>you seen that where it's like it looks </v>

3589
02:47:48.960 --> 02:47:49.880
<v Speaker 5>like this and then the in the middle </v>
<v Speaker 5>looks like a,</v>

3590
02:47:50.090 --> 02:47:52.300
<v Speaker 5>like you're going through a bridge or a </v>
<v Speaker 5>tunnel.</v>

3591
02:47:52.570 --> 02:47:57.570
<v Speaker 5>He so cArs can drive through it in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>top part is the bus part and so things </v>

3592
02:47:57.941 --> 02:48:00.000
<v Speaker 5>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's say they're at.</v>

3593
02:48:00.170 --> 02:48:03.490
<v Speaker 5>I saw that it's like it's like a train </v>
<v Speaker 5>more than a bus,</v>

3594
02:48:03.491 --> 02:48:04.550
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because the tracks.</v>

3595
02:48:04.551 --> 02:48:09.551
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But things like that I think are going </v>

3596
02:48:09.551 --> 02:48:12.091
<v Speaker 5>to improve a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean imagine if that was just a non </v>

3597
02:48:12.091 --> 02:48:15.540
<v Speaker 5>continuous retards going to be playing </v>
<v Speaker 5>pokemon and slam into your fucking </v>

3598
02:48:15.540 --> 02:48:16.240
<v Speaker 5>train.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Knock it over on a traffic.</v>

3599
02:48:16.420 --> 02:48:17.550
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3600
02:48:17.760 --> 02:48:22.760
<v Speaker 5>That's the problem is when you have that</v>
<v Speaker 5>and retain things that are like regular </v>

3601
02:48:22.760 --> 02:48:24.070
<v Speaker 5>cars that are driving the same road </v>
<v Speaker 5>together.</v>

3602
02:48:24.250 --> 02:48:27.670
<v Speaker 5>If you go under someone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're almost like in contact with them.</v>

3603
02:48:27.671 --> 02:48:29.710
<v Speaker 5>So if you get an accident while you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>under there,</v>

3604
02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:36.000
<v Speaker 5>guys will change lanes while they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>underneath those buses and they'll </v>

3605
02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:36.000
<v Speaker 5>collide into each other and they'll </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking spin the,</v>

3606
02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:38.010
<v Speaker 5>the bus out of control to go off the </v>
<v Speaker 5>rails</v>

3607
02:48:38.100 --> 02:48:42.420
<v Speaker 14>crashed and other people,</v>
<v Speaker 14>the pulp will die in a horrible crash on</v>

3608
02:48:42.421 --> 02:48:42.960
<v Speaker 14>the four.</v>
<v Speaker 14>Oh,</v>

3609
02:48:42.961 --> 02:48:47.961
<v Speaker 14>five in los Angeles.</v>
<v Speaker 14>The best pub we've ever had was last at </v>

3610
02:48:47.961 --> 02:48:51.030
<v Speaker 14>this ridiculous policy of public </v>
<v Speaker 14>transportation in los angeles has always</v>

3611
02:48:51.031 --> 02:48:54.570
<v Speaker 14>been an individual transportation city.</v>
<v Speaker 14>People love their cars.</v>

3612
02:48:54.600 --> 02:48:55.830
<v Speaker 14>they love to be by themselves.</v>

3613
02:48:56.800 --> 02:48:59.050
<v Speaker 5>I'm looking at this article.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I found out this,</v>

3614
02:48:59.051 --> 02:49:01.210
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this might not even be real,</v>

3615
02:49:01.440 --> 02:49:03.490
<v Speaker 5>like this thing obviously exists.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a real thing.</v>

3616
02:49:03.491 --> 02:49:05.740
<v Speaker 5>But the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See this exact one that showed last week</v>

3617
02:49:05.741 --> 02:49:07.350
<v Speaker 5>or whenever this came out was the same</v>

3618
02:49:07.980 --> 02:49:10.980
<v Speaker 7>whatever train bus you want to call that</v>
<v Speaker 7>showed in a test that they use six years</v>

3619
02:49:10.981 --> 02:49:15.981
<v Speaker 7>before this.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And it was only on like a 300 meter </v>

3620
02:49:15.981 --> 02:49:19.160
<v Speaker 7>piece of land and 30.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Even now this says like if this project </v>

3621
02:49:19.171 --> 02:49:21.060
<v Speaker 7>is even feasible or if it's even real,</v>
<v Speaker 7>wasn't.</v>

3622
02:49:21.440 --> 02:49:23.400
<v Speaker 7>They were just road testing it like </v>
<v Speaker 7>this.</v>

3623
02:49:23.440 --> 02:49:27.240
<v Speaker 7>Or I read it as if they're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they're just seeing if this would work.</v>

3624
02:49:27.270 --> 02:49:28.870
<v Speaker 7>Like testing,</v>
<v Speaker 7>huh?</v>

3625
02:49:30.880 --> 02:49:32.330
<v Speaker 4>Well It makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3626
02:49:32.860 --> 02:49:34.900
<v Speaker 4>I mean it makes sense to have something </v>
<v Speaker 4>like that,</v>

3627
02:49:34.901 --> 02:49:37.760
<v Speaker 4>but if people can judge whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 4>they.</v>

3628
02:49:37.940 --> 02:49:40.240
<v Speaker 4>Like if something's on sale,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if it's a car,</v>

3629
02:49:40.241 --> 02:49:45.241
<v Speaker 4>it's one thing if a guy's hitting the </v>
<v Speaker 4>brakes and turn the wheel and all that </v>

3630
02:49:45.241 --> 02:49:45.241
<v Speaker 4>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's one thing.</v>

3631
02:49:45.241 --> 02:49:49.231
<v Speaker 4>Or if a bus same kind of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but as soon as people interact with </v>

3632
02:49:49.231 --> 02:49:53.611
<v Speaker 4>trains,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a problem with that because like </v>

3633
02:49:53.611 --> 02:49:56.790
<v Speaker 4>one of them is like super steady and </v>
<v Speaker 4>static or move to the same sort of </v>

3634
02:49:56.790 --> 02:49:58.210
<v Speaker 4>speeds and it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't vary.</v>

3635
02:49:58.211 --> 02:50:03.211
<v Speaker 4>That was hit the brakes and do a bunch </v>
<v Speaker 4>of things that people have cars do and </v>

3636
02:50:03.211 --> 02:50:04.300
<v Speaker 4>the other one does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the one that does the one that's real</v>

3637
02:50:04.301 --> 02:50:07.450
<v Speaker 4>mobile,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the person driven car is going to figure</v>

3638
02:50:07.451 --> 02:50:10.840
<v Speaker 4>out how to time that train.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They got to take some chances if they're</v>

3639
02:50:10.841 --> 02:50:15.841
<v Speaker 4>all running through the same road </v>
<v Speaker 4>together and they're cutting each other </v>

3640
02:50:15.841 --> 02:50:18.541
<v Speaker 4>off and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's gonna be some asshole doesn't </v>

3641
02:50:18.541 --> 02:50:19.480
<v Speaker 4>seem like it's to work as good people </v>
<v Speaker 4>are going to tax.</v>

3642
02:50:19.481 --> 02:50:22.480
<v Speaker 4>They're going to slam into that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just weird.</v>

3643
02:50:22.790 --> 02:50:24.670
<v Speaker 4>Can have a train in the car in the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>place.</v>

3644
02:50:25.410 --> 02:50:27.970
<v Speaker 7>It seems about as real as hyperloop </v>
<v Speaker 7>maybe is right now.</v>

3645
02:50:28.140 --> 02:50:28.460
<v Speaker 7>Which.</v>

3646
02:50:28.840 --> 02:50:30.600
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well that's sort of real.</v>

3647
02:50:30.601 --> 02:50:34.390
<v Speaker 4>At least everything that is real now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a whisper at one time,</v>

3648
02:50:34.420 --> 02:50:39.420
<v Speaker 4>so I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hyperloop is real in the sense that no </v>

3649
02:50:39.420 --> 02:50:39.420
<v Speaker 4>one's written on it yet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that is,</v>

<v Speaker 4>that's moving.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

3651
02:50:40.810 --> 02:50:42.520
<v Speaker 4>there's movement in that direction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

3652
02:50:42.910 --> 02:50:46.480
<v Speaker 4>there's concepts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's engineers working,</v>

02:50:51.481 --> 02:50:51.670
<v Speaker 4>involved in technology.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're beIng consulted.</v>

3655
02:50:51.671 --> 02:50:56.671
<v Speaker 4>They're trying to figure out how to make</v>
<v Speaker 4>that actually come to light so that it </v>

3656
02:50:56.671 --> 02:50:56.671
<v Speaker 4>is a real.</v>

<v Speaker 4>should be.</v>

3679
02:51:57.430 --> 02:52:01.970
<v Speaker 4>It should be razor sharp swords that if </v>

<v Speaker 6>any of those places where there's a lot </v>

3701
02:53:27.120 --> 02:53:28.050
<v Speaker 6>of deer,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think do.</v>

3702
02:53:28.080 --> 02:53:31.100
<v Speaker 6>Would you say Michigan is the worst?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You say?</v>

3703
02:53:31.120 --> 02:53:36.120
<v Speaker 6>Michigan.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We went over the country like how many </v>

3704
02:53:36.120 --> 02:53:38.881
<v Speaker 6>different people get in car accidents </v>
<v Speaker 6>with deer every year,</v>

3705
02:53:39.431 --> 02:53:44.431
<v Speaker 6>and I think Michigan was fucking insane.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like more than a hundred thousand people</v>

3706
02:53:44.940 --> 02:53:49.480
<v Speaker 6>get in car accidents a year with deer.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

3707
02:53:49.540 --> 02:53:51.130
<v Speaker 6>to Be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 6>alabama's the worst.</v>

3708
02:53:51.690 --> 02:53:52.660
<v Speaker 6>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What are they at?</v>

3709
02:53:52.930 --> 02:53:57.930
<v Speaker 5>One and 127.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One in 100.</v>

3710
02:53:58.961 --> 02:54:02.020
<v Speaker 5>20 seven car accidents involve the deer </v>
<v Speaker 5>chance of collision.</v>

3711
02:54:02.021 --> 02:54:03.520
<v Speaker 5>It says with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh my god,</v>

3712
02:54:03.521 --> 02:54:05.320
<v Speaker 5>that's a one percent chance.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Essentially.</v>

3713
02:54:05.710 --> 02:54:10.710
<v Speaker 5>That's like if you drive 100 times,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one time we got to kick fucking crazy.</v>

3714
02:54:11.190 --> 02:54:15.650
<v Speaker 5>That is if you drive 100 times,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how many times did you have 100 jobs?</v>

3715
02:54:15.700 --> 02:54:16.530
<v Speaker 5>Michigan's a little.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

3718
02:54:22.150 --> 02:54:27.150
<v Speaker 5>Minnesota times,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it doesn't matter if there's a deer </v>

3719
02:54:27.150 --> 02:54:27.220
<v Speaker 5>in the road.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I was in Montana recently,</v>
<v Speaker 5>every fucking person up there has a </v>

3726
02:54:42.540 --> 02:54:44.230
<v Speaker 5>battering ram welded to the front of </v>
<v Speaker 5>their truck.</v>

3727
02:54:44.620 --> 02:54:47.740
<v Speaker 5>Everyone one in 39.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my god.</v>

3729
02:54:50.770 --> 02:54:51.280
<v Speaker 5>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 5>go ahead.</v>

3730
02:54:51.370 --> 02:54:56.370
<v Speaker 5>I was in Michigan like a year ago and we</v>
<v Speaker 5>drove down to do shows in like Michigan </v>

3731
02:54:56.370 --> 02:54:56.950
<v Speaker 5>to columbus,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ohio to whatever.</v>

3732
02:54:57.220 --> 02:55:02.220
<v Speaker 5>But the drive from Michigan to columbus,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was so many dead deer on the side </v>

3733
02:55:02.220 --> 02:55:03.770
<v Speaker 5>of the road,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like every half mile there was just dead</v>

3734
02:55:04.220 --> 02:55:07.700
<v Speaker 1>bodies and in blood it was just guts and</v>
<v Speaker 1>blood and deer everywhere.</v>

3735
02:55:07.701 --> 02:55:10.520
<v Speaker 1>It was really disgusting how many deer </v>
<v Speaker 1>deer there were.</v>

3736
02:55:10.620 --> 02:55:12.710
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's rules and whether or not you</v>

3737
02:55:12.711 --> 02:55:17.711
<v Speaker 1>can eat it like a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you get there like right after the </v>

3738
02:55:17.711 --> 02:55:20.711
<v Speaker 1>accident,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you can call the cops and some </v>

3739
02:55:20.711 --> 02:55:21.440
<v Speaker 1>states and they'll let you take the deer</v>
<v Speaker 1>home and eat it.</v>

3740
02:55:21.800 --> 02:55:23.810
<v Speaker 1>Which is nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if somebody leaves it behind,</v>

3741
02:55:23.870 --> 02:55:28.870
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a person that's poor and you </v>

3742
02:55:28.870 --> 02:55:28.870
<v Speaker 1>run across a deer that just got hit by a</v>
<v Speaker 1>car,</v>

3743
02:55:28.870 --> 02:55:33.260
<v Speaker 1>that's like a hundred pounds of meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like 100 meals,</v>

3744
02:55:33.470 --> 02:55:35.870
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing for your family,</v>

3745
02:55:35.871 --> 02:55:40.871
<v Speaker 1>you know you can all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a lot of people that get </v>

3746
02:55:40.871 --> 02:55:42.290
<v Speaker 1>excited about roadkill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the real problem is it kills.</v>

3747
02:55:42.710 --> 02:55:46.400
<v Speaker 1>I think he kills 200 people a year in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this country.</v>

3748
02:55:46.430 --> 02:55:51.430
<v Speaker 1>Is that the number?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's 200 people a year in this </v>

3749
02:55:51.430 --> 02:55:55.001
<v Speaker 1>country alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Die from collisions with deere 200 times</v>

3750
02:55:55.521 --> 02:55:57.080
<v Speaker 1>more than we'd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's two.</v>

3751
02:55:57.081 --> 02:56:02.081
<v Speaker 1>It's 2 million car accidents or one </v>
<v Speaker 1>point 5 million car accidents in this </v>

3752
02:56:02.081 --> 02:56:05.210
<v Speaker 1>country every year with dear one point 5</v>
<v Speaker 1>million.</v>

3753
02:56:05.600 --> 02:56:08.210
<v Speaker 1>And I think the number of people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>dies like 200.</v>

3754
02:56:08.510 --> 02:56:12.050
<v Speaker 1>Does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But either way.</v>

3755
02:56:12.290 --> 02:56:15.090
<v Speaker 1>One point 5 million on 100 percent sure </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>

3756
02:56:15.260 --> 02:56:17.630
<v Speaker 1>It says leads to about 200 human deaths </v>
<v Speaker 1>in one point.</v>

3757
02:56:17.660 --> 02:56:19.830
<v Speaker 1>$1,000,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>in property damage.</v>

3758
02:56:20.190 --> 02:56:23.450
<v Speaker 1>Seen them property damage thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what about the deer's life?</v>

3759
02:56:23.570 --> 02:56:25.610
<v Speaker 1>Because that not worth money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You son of a bitch.</v>

3760
02:56:25.920 --> 02:56:27.710
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you put money on life.</v>

3761
02:56:28.970 --> 02:56:33.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm a killer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I turned into a werewolf that bear video</v>

3762
02:56:33.870 --> 02:56:35.960
<v Speaker 1>I think you posted the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

3763
02:56:36.180 --> 02:56:37.910
<v Speaker 1>That's so fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not good.</v>

3764
02:56:39.410 --> 02:56:41.060
<v Speaker 1>That makes me want to buy a gun just for</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

3765
02:56:42.240 --> 02:56:45.770
<v Speaker 1>Not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of not good lately.</v>

3766
02:56:45.900 --> 02:56:50.900
<v Speaker 1>What did you see?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The mountain lion one for the mountain </v>

3767
02:56:50.900 --> 02:56:53.201
<v Speaker 1>lion was falling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy around trying to figure out </v>

3768
02:56:53.201 --> 02:56:53.201
<v Speaker 1>whether or not it should jack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so not good.</v>

3769
02:56:53.201 --> 02:56:58.030
<v Speaker 1>Big ass old cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a big fucking cat and it's looking </v>

3770
02:56:58.030 --> 02:56:58.880
<v Speaker 1>at them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's an old cat,</v>

3771
02:56:58.881 --> 02:57:00.590
<v Speaker 1>but I mean it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a mature cat.</v>

3772
02:57:00.780 --> 02:57:02.210
<v Speaker 1>Big cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did he do it?</v>

3773
02:57:02.211 --> 02:57:07.211
<v Speaker 1>He should have done and that sits like </v>
<v Speaker 1>you kind of walked away and I thought </v>

3774
02:57:07.211 --> 02:57:08.150
<v Speaker 1>you're not supposed to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not supposed to walk back,</v>

3775
02:57:08.151 --> 02:57:10.340
<v Speaker 1>but you have to be careful and </v>
<v Speaker 1>challenging it.</v>

3776
02:57:10.341 --> 02:57:13.160
<v Speaker 1>You're not supposed to look at it in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes because it might.</v>

3777
02:57:13.430 --> 02:57:18.430
<v Speaker 1>It might instill a primal rage in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking murderers predator where it just</v>

3778
02:57:19.041 --> 02:57:23.240
<v Speaker 1>decides to fuck you up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to say what you're supposed to</v>

3779
02:57:23.241 --> 02:57:28.241
<v Speaker 1>do and what you're not supposed to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I've heard people say that you </v>

3780
02:57:28.241 --> 02:57:30.530
<v Speaker 1>should talk loud and I've heard people </v>
<v Speaker 1>say that you should just walk away,</v>

3781
02:57:30.830 --> 02:57:32.030
<v Speaker 1>jiggle your car keys.</v>

3782
02:57:32.300 --> 02:57:32.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3783
02:57:32.830 --> 02:57:37.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you can predict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like you can't predict like a </v>

3784
02:57:37.830 --> 02:57:40.430
<v Speaker 1>regular cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll get how many people have </v>

3785
02:57:40.430 --> 02:57:43.091
<v Speaker 1>different kinds of cats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you have different cats that I </v>

3786
02:57:43.091 --> 02:57:45.731
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all have different cats and I've had </v>

3787
02:57:45.731 --> 02:57:45.890
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of the same kind of cats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They behave different.</v>

3788
02:57:47.400 --> 02:57:50.000
<v Speaker 1>They just all fucking animals are </v>
<v Speaker 1>different,</v>

3789
02:57:50.001 --> 02:57:55.001
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can run across one wolf that wants </v>

3790
02:57:55.001 --> 02:57:57.431
<v Speaker 1>to fuck you up and you could walk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you can come across another wolf </v>

3791
02:57:57.431 --> 02:58:01.601
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't want to have anything to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>with you and wants to stay in the </v>

3792
02:58:01.601 --> 02:58:04.061
<v Speaker 1>background and move away from you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's entirely possible that this guy </v>

3793
02:58:04.061 --> 02:58:07.050
<v Speaker 1>just ran across a cat that was thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about eating a person.</v>

3794
02:58:07.490 --> 02:58:10.830
<v Speaker 1>What would he have been able to kill </v>
<v Speaker 1>this and had been okay.</v>

3795
02:58:11.260 --> 02:58:12.100
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh man.</v>

3796
02:58:12.700 --> 02:58:13.840
<v Speaker 1>Self defense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3797
02:58:14.160 --> 02:58:15.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he had a weapon,</v>

3798
02:58:15.151 --> 02:58:17.670
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think he had a weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he had anything like this.</v>

3799
02:58:17.671 --> 02:58:18.420
<v Speaker 1>This isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3800
02:58:18.421 --> 02:58:19.940
<v Speaker 1>You couldn't have just killed it because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's near them.</v>

3801
02:58:20.680 --> 02:58:25.680
<v Speaker 1>You would have to make a judgment call </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you'd have to be able to support </v>

3802
02:58:25.680 --> 02:58:26.040
<v Speaker 1>that judgment call.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if someone was out there,</v>

3803
02:58:26.041 --> 02:58:28.200
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you were a bow hunter and you have</v>

3804
02:58:28.201 --> 02:58:33.201
<v Speaker 1>an a stare down with this mountain lion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be absolutely sure that </v>

3805
02:58:33.201 --> 02:58:33.990
<v Speaker 1>you've exhausted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3806
02:58:34.010 --> 02:58:37.280
<v Speaker 4>all of the possibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But there's a fine line,</v>

3807
02:58:37.310 --> 02:58:39.830
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is like you want to,</v>

3808
02:58:39.920 --> 02:58:41.480
<v Speaker 4>you want to be able to preserve your own</v>
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>

3809
02:58:41.750 --> 02:58:45.810
<v Speaker 4>You want to make sure that you're okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you also want to you,</v>

3810
02:58:46.360 --> 02:58:48.620
<v Speaker 4>if you're going to kill this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want to be right about it.</v>

3811
02:58:49.040 --> 02:58:52.250
<v Speaker 4>So you have to figure out what is that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you may hit that switch.</v>

3812
02:58:52.580 --> 02:58:56.570
<v Speaker 4>So do you hold onto the arrow and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>hold your bone front of that cat.</v>

3813
02:58:56.900 --> 02:58:59.420
<v Speaker 4>Like right there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I gotta be honest with you.</v>

3814
02:58:59.960 --> 02:59:04.960
<v Speaker 4>I might shoot that fucking cat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The cat is 15 feet away from him and </v>

3815
02:59:04.960 --> 02:59:08.981
<v Speaker 4>this guy got away with it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he didn't have to and now the cat's </v>

3816
02:59:08.981 --> 02:59:11.111
<v Speaker 4>moving in on him at 15 feet away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The problem is once this thing jumps on </v>

3817
02:59:11.271 --> 02:59:13.520
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't have a fucking chance.</v>

3818
02:59:13.521 --> 02:59:17.060
<v Speaker 4>And once it realizes how weak you really</v>
<v Speaker 4>are because you look way bigger than it,</v>

3819
02:59:17.090 --> 02:59:18.380
<v Speaker 4>you're standing like right there.</v>

3820
02:59:18.440 --> 02:59:20.590
<v Speaker 4>That cat's dead right there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Broadside.</v>

3821
02:59:21.270 --> 02:59:26.270
<v Speaker 4>That's 15 feet away from.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm drawn an arrow back and I'm getting </v>

3822
02:59:26.270 --> 02:59:26.780
<v Speaker 4>rid of that cat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't take that chance.</v>

3823
02:59:26.781 --> 02:59:31.781
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to die because I don't </v>

3824
02:59:31.781 --> 02:59:31.781
<v Speaker 4>want it to die.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to kill it,</v>

3825
02:59:31.781 --> 02:59:34.640
<v Speaker 4>but I don't want it to kill me for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this is an animal that is absolutely</v>

3826
02:59:34.641 --> 02:59:37.370
<v Speaker 4>stocking a person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's trying to figure out whether or not</v>

3827
02:59:37.371 --> 02:59:38.510
<v Speaker 4>it can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

3828
02:59:38.511 --> 02:59:40.400
<v Speaker 4>in this guy's case,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he got lucky.</v>

3829
02:59:40.490 --> 02:59:43.340
<v Speaker 4>He talked enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He maybe he was a bigger guy.</v>

3830
02:59:43.940 --> 02:59:46.100
<v Speaker 4>Maybe the cat just didn't feel like it </v>
<v Speaker 4>was worth it.</v>

3831
02:59:46.470 --> 02:59:48.380
<v Speaker 4>I'd been throwing rocks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe.</v>

3832
02:59:48.440 --> 02:59:50.950
<v Speaker 4>Maybe the rocks would make it charge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you don't know,</v>

3833
02:59:50.960 --> 02:59:52.040
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't know.</v>

3834
02:59:52.041 --> 02:59:54.440
<v Speaker 4>That's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If someone can tell you if,</v>

3835
02:59:54.450 --> 02:59:54.970
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3836
02:59:55.020 --> 02:59:58.310
<v Speaker 4>the general rule of thumb is if a bear </v>
<v Speaker 4>attacks you play dead.</v>

3837
02:59:58.940 --> 03:00:00.980
<v Speaker 4>But if a cougar attacks you fight back.</v>

3838
03:00:01.070 --> 03:00:03.440
<v Speaker 1>Where was this app by the way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he was on his bike so he had his</v>

3839
03:00:03.441 --> 03:00:05.510
<v Speaker 1>bike in between them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe that's good.</v>

3840
03:00:05.511 --> 03:00:06.800
<v Speaker 1>Use it as like a little shield or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

3841
03:00:06.830 --> 03:00:08.420
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be taking those tires off.</v>

3842
03:00:08.421 --> 03:00:12.650
<v Speaker 1>I'd beat that fucking thing to death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be scared as fuck right here to.</v>

3843
03:00:12.950 --> 03:00:14.660
<v Speaker 1>This guy is so cool about this.</v>

3844
03:00:15.490 --> 03:00:20.490
<v Speaker 15>Unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 15>There's a mountain lion right here.</v>

3845
03:00:26.060 --> 03:00:27.650
<v Speaker 4>I mean folks were free.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People listening.</v>

3846
03:00:27.651 --> 03:00:32.651
<v Speaker 4>It's on a trail.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This thing is 15 feet in front of them </v>

3847
03:00:32.651 --> 03:00:32.810
<v Speaker 4>right in front of me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

3848
03:00:32.960 --> 03:00:34.580
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's 15 feet in front of him,</v>

3849
03:00:34.581 --> 03:00:36.620
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean maybe 20.</v>

3850
03:00:36.750 --> 03:00:41.750
<v Speaker 4>And he says this helmet on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whatever that thing's bite your face </v>

3851
03:00:41.750 --> 03:00:44.681
<v Speaker 4>off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a nice time to own a gun.</v>

3852
03:00:45.590 --> 03:00:47.180
<v Speaker 4>Right here is nice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You go,</v>

3853
03:00:48.080 --> 03:00:48.950
<v Speaker 4>hey man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey man.</v>

3854
03:00:49.100 --> 03:00:50.600
<v Speaker 4>Check this out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Boom.</v>

3855
03:00:51.410 --> 03:00:56.410
<v Speaker 4>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what I would've done if I </v>

3856
03:00:56.410 --> 03:00:56.410
<v Speaker 4>was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you have a gun,</v>

3857
03:00:56.410 --> 03:00:56.840
<v Speaker 4>you shoot it the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just just go,</v>

3858
03:00:56.870 --> 03:00:57.740
<v Speaker 4>bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3859
03:00:57.741 --> 03:01:00.370
<v Speaker 4>he's moving towards it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's cute.</v>

3860
03:01:01.070 --> 03:01:02.410
<v Speaker 6>I might say to you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I might.</v>

3861
03:01:02.440 --> 03:01:04.000
<v Speaker 6>He's backing up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I might.</v>

3862
03:01:05.770 --> 03:01:07.810
<v Speaker 6>I might go crazy and see if I could </v>
<v Speaker 6>scare them off here.</v>

3863
03:01:07.900 --> 03:01:10.360
<v Speaker 6>That's probably what I would be doing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'd be screaming at it more.</v>

3864
03:01:10.410 --> 03:01:11.440
<v Speaker 6>Be dead.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3865
03:01:11.441 --> 03:01:12.520
<v Speaker 6>most likely.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Let's be honest.</v>

3866
03:01:12.521 --> 03:01:14.410
<v Speaker 6>He'd be wheezing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Delicious.</v>

3867
03:01:14.430 --> 03:01:16.080
<v Speaker 6>You lit a cigarette up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Maybe he'd run away.</v>

3868
03:01:16.120 --> 03:01:21.120
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would use fire cigarette smoking </v>

3869
03:01:21.120 --> 03:01:21.120
<v Speaker 6>house.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would probably do that.</v>

3870
03:01:21.120 --> 03:01:25.121
<v Speaker 6>I'd probably like if I had my lighter </v>
<v Speaker 6>and light my shirt on fire or something </v>

3871
03:01:25.121 --> 03:01:28.291
<v Speaker 6>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There was an old man in Canada just a </v>

3872
03:01:28.291 --> 03:01:28.291
<v Speaker 6>couple of years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 6>killed one with a knife.</v>

3873
03:01:28.291 --> 03:01:29.950
<v Speaker 6>He got attacked by a mountain lion and </v>
<v Speaker 6>you're 60 years old.</v>

3874
03:01:29.951 --> 03:01:34.951
<v Speaker 6>He's fighting off and cut its neck </v>
<v Speaker 6>fighting to the death with a monster</v>

3875
03:01:38.720 --> 03:01:40.640
<v Speaker 1>jumps out clause.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A hold of them.</v>

3876
03:01:41.390 --> 03:01:46.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think mountain lions for just for the </v>

3877
03:01:46.390 --> 03:01:49.691
<v Speaker 1>record.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think mountain lions are fucking </v>

3878
03:01:49.691 --> 03:01:49.691
<v Speaker 1>awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big fan of mountain lions.</v>

3879
03:01:49.691 --> 03:01:51.050
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of the people that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>animal rights activists,</v>

3880
03:01:51.051 --> 03:01:53.650
<v Speaker 1>they might hear this and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what about the person?</v>

3881
03:01:53.900 --> 03:01:57.620
<v Speaker 1>The person shouldn't be there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the lion's home.</v>

3882
03:01:57.900 --> 03:02:02.150
<v Speaker 1>A persons in the lion's home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's be honest folks.</v>

3883
03:02:02.330 --> 03:02:05.900
<v Speaker 1>There's people that are beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They produced poetry,</v>

3884
03:02:05.930 --> 03:02:08.540
<v Speaker 1>they write songs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they make movies,</v>

3885
03:02:08.541 --> 03:02:11.000
<v Speaker 1>they love you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They take you out to dinner,</v>

3886
03:02:11.001 --> 03:02:12.680
<v Speaker 1>they're your friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can count on them.</v>

3887
03:02:12.681 --> 03:02:17.681
<v Speaker 1>They offer emotional support.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mountain lions don't give you any of </v>

3888
03:02:17.681 --> 03:02:17.681
<v Speaker 1>that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when it comes,</v>

3889
03:02:17.681 --> 03:02:19.130
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know why I said poetry,</v>

3890
03:02:19.131 --> 03:02:21.110
<v Speaker 1>I believe I agree with everything I said</v>
<v Speaker 1>up to poetry,</v>

3891
03:02:22.100 --> 03:02:24.950
<v Speaker 1>but it comes to who do I like more?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mountain lion or that guy on the bike.</v>

3892
03:02:25.550 --> 03:02:27.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know that guy on the bike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love him.</v>

3893
03:02:27.590 --> 03:02:29.000
<v Speaker 1>Give him a hug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shoot that fucking thing.</v>

3894
03:02:29.001 --> 03:02:31.850
<v Speaker 1>If I was nearby creepy ass predator cat,</v>

3895
03:02:32.970 --> 03:02:34.950
<v Speaker 6>it would be cool to have a full </v>
<v Speaker 6>simulation.</v>

3896
03:02:35.010 --> 03:02:35.940
<v Speaker 6>Like you can be like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>all right,</v>

3897
03:02:35.941 --> 03:02:38.930
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to see what happens if I went </v>
<v Speaker 6>up to it as if it was a normal cat,</v>

3898
03:02:39.100 --> 03:02:44.100
<v Speaker 6>like kind of like grizzly man style.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You just see red screen.</v>

3899
03:02:44.740 --> 03:02:46.890
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but if you could try everything.</v>

3900
03:02:46.940 --> 03:02:48.830
<v Speaker 6>Like now I'm ready.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Tried through mushu.</v>

3901
03:02:48.930 --> 03:02:53.930
<v Speaker 6>It'd be like a lawnmower.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hit your face spray all over the screen.</v>

3902
03:02:56.010 --> 03:03:01.010
<v Speaker 6>I just wonder like if there was like </v>
<v Speaker 6>that kind of calming approach or </v>

3903
03:03:01.011 --> 03:03:01.630
<v Speaker 6>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

3904
03:03:01.950 --> 03:03:02.670
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

3905
03:03:02.671 --> 03:03:07.380
<v Speaker 6>What are you the grizzly man?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hey mr.</v>

3906
03:03:08.880 --> 03:03:11.760
<v Speaker 6>It's going to be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He must just chocolate.</v>

3907
03:03:12.080 --> 03:03:14.030
<v Speaker 6>I remember there's a scene,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the grizzly man where uh,</v>

3908
03:03:14.040 --> 03:03:17.900
<v Speaker 6>the bear took a shit and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this came out of this.</v>

3909
03:03:18.030 --> 03:03:22.890
<v Speaker 6>Came out of her butt touching.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I feel like I'm touching inside of her.</v>

3910
03:03:23.240 --> 03:03:26.430
<v Speaker 6>Came out of her,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I get his hands on bear shit.</v>

3911
03:03:26.550 --> 03:03:28.590
<v Speaker 6>I wish there could be a sequel to that </v>
<v Speaker 6>movie so bad.</v>

3912
03:03:28.591 --> 03:03:30.840
<v Speaker 6>Like bob ross could plAy it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Or here's the thing.</v>

3913
03:03:30.940 --> 03:03:31.000
<v Speaker 6>It</v>

3914
03:03:31.010 --> 03:03:36.010
<v Speaker 1>wasn't a sequel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that guy made I think more than a </v>

3915
03:03:37.300 --> 03:03:39.640
<v Speaker 1>hundred hours of footage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had a,</v>

3916
03:03:39.641 --> 03:03:44.641
<v Speaker 1>an entire show that they did on one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the reality tv channels were.</v>

3917
03:03:45.311 --> 03:03:50.311
<v Speaker 1>It was a grizzly man show where it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like they edited a lot of his last </v>

3918
03:03:50.311 --> 03:03:53.770
<v Speaker 1>footage and it was really fascinating </v>
<v Speaker 1>because as misguided as this guy was who</v>

3919
03:03:53.771 --> 03:03:57.190
<v Speaker 1>was definitely misguided and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely had some issues for sure.</v>

3920
03:03:57.350 --> 03:03:57.980
<v Speaker 1>He really</v>

3921
03:03:57.980 --> 03:04:02.980
<v Speaker 4>did love bears and he was really </v>
<v Speaker 4>passionate about bears and he was </v>

3922
03:04:02.980 --> 03:04:06.791
<v Speaker 4>passionate about describing various </v>
<v Speaker 4>aspects of their behavior and it was </v>

3923
03:04:06.791 --> 03:04:10.220
<v Speaker 4>really interesting and he got some </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking bad ass footage,</v>

3924
03:04:10.221 --> 03:04:15.221
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He got some incredible footage like </v>

3925
03:04:15.221 --> 03:04:15.221
<v Speaker 4>really close up footage of bears </v>
<v Speaker 4>fighting.</v>

3926
03:04:15.221 --> 03:04:19.870
<v Speaker 4>He got footage of bears coming right up </v>
<v Speaker 4>to him and say like literally sniffing </v>

3927
03:04:19.870 --> 03:04:23.051
<v Speaker 4>his hand and running away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He got footage of wild fox is becoming </v>

3928
03:04:23.051 --> 03:04:27.161
<v Speaker 4>his friend,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like hanging around his camp and he </v>

3929
03:04:27.161 --> 03:04:27.161
<v Speaker 4>would feed them and hang out with them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They'd steal his hat.</v>

3930
03:04:27.161 --> 03:04:31.510
<v Speaker 4>He got amazing footage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so if you look at the guy's just like a </v>

3931
03:04:31.510 --> 03:04:32.810
<v Speaker 4>wildlife photographer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uk,</v>

3932
03:04:32.811 --> 03:04:37.811
<v Speaker 4>he's like one of the greatest of all </v>
<v Speaker 4>time in a way because what he did was </v>

3933
03:04:37.881 --> 03:04:41.750
<v Speaker 4>something that nobody was willing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Go full screen on this motherfucker.</v>

3934
03:04:42.860 --> 03:04:44.540
<v Speaker 4>Can't put this on youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3935
03:04:44.540 --> 03:04:45.290
<v Speaker 4>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course.</v>

3936
03:04:45.291 --> 03:04:46.100
<v Speaker 4>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course,</v>

3937
03:04:46.610 --> 03:04:47.440
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3938
03:04:47.540 --> 03:04:49.490
<v Speaker 4>if you haven't seen this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is two bears.</v>

3939
03:04:49.491 --> 03:04:54.491
<v Speaker 4>I think we did commentary on this during</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ice house chronicles because I was </v>

3940
03:04:54.491 --> 03:04:54.491
<v Speaker 4>talking about jitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

3941
03:04:54.491 --> 03:04:57.050
<v Speaker 4>he's got very good jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the way the big bear on top,</v>

3942
03:04:57.051 --> 03:04:59.420
<v Speaker 4>it's passing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The other guy on the bottom is trying to</v>

3943
03:04:59.421 --> 03:05:01.250
<v Speaker 4>work the guard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's putting feet on the hips,</v>

3944
03:05:01.400 --> 03:05:06.370
<v Speaker 4>but the big bears using pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like a old school like sallow.</v>

3945
03:05:06.371 --> 03:05:10.850
<v Speaker 4>He barrow like fucking rock solid </v>
<v Speaker 4>jujitsu.</v>

3946
03:05:10.880 --> 03:05:13.340
<v Speaker 4>Like this is what I'm looking at here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And pooping,</v>

3947
03:05:13.670 --> 03:05:14.300
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 4>to war.</v>

3949
03:05:16.460 --> 03:05:20.420
<v Speaker 4>But this is very much like jujitsu in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of ways.</v>

3950
03:05:20.421 --> 03:05:20.710
<v Speaker 4>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm.</v>

3951
03:05:20.711 --> 03:05:22.040

<v Speaker 4>when I'm watching this,</v>

3952
03:05:22.550 --> 03:05:26.360
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is like rafael lovato.</v>

3953
03:05:26.600 --> 03:05:29.840
<v Speaker 4>This is that kind of jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like super strong,</v>

3954
03:05:29.841 --> 03:05:33.680
<v Speaker 4>real technical pressure power to get on </v>
<v Speaker 4>top of you.</v>

3955
03:05:33.680 --> 03:05:36.080
<v Speaker 4>And they put the fucking clamped down on</v>
<v Speaker 4>you and you're dead.</v>

3956
03:05:36.610 --> 03:05:38.060
<v Speaker 4>Like this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bear is kind of doing that.</v>

3957
03:05:38.090 --> 03:05:39.920
<v Speaker 4>But the bottom bear got up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at this.</v>

3958
03:05:40.010 --> 03:05:41.660
<v Speaker 4>He's game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's not as big,</v>

3959
03:05:42.110 --> 03:05:45.080
<v Speaker 4>but he's game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They go to war,</v>

3960
03:05:45.081 --> 03:05:47.300
<v Speaker 4>the guy on the left is considerably </v>
<v Speaker 4>smaller if you see it,</v>

3961
03:05:47.360 --> 03:05:52.360
<v Speaker 4>you see how much smaller is like the one</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the right is like literally like 25 </v>

3962
03:05:52.360 --> 03:05:56.321
<v Speaker 4>percent larger,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the guy in the bottom is not given </v>

3963
03:05:56.321 --> 03:05:56.321
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>

<v Speaker 4>versus I'm a bodybuilder and I think the</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude was like,</v>

3972
03:06:21.831 --> 03:06:25.040
<v Speaker 4>I want to say it was like 240 pounds and</v>
<v Speaker 4>pedro sauer was like 1:50</v>

3973
03:06:25.520 --> 03:06:30.520
<v Speaker 4>and he got in this like street fight </v>
<v Speaker 4>with this guy in a gym and this is back </v>

3974
03:06:30.520 --> 03:06:32.780
<v Speaker 4>in the day when like the gracie </v>
<v Speaker 4>challenges were going on.</v>

3975
03:06:32.780 --> 03:06:36.170
<v Speaker 4>She'll like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is the guy he's fucking jacked.</v>

3976
03:06:36.680 --> 03:06:40.430
<v Speaker 4>And pedro sauer I believe is hixon </v>
<v Speaker 4>gracie linneage.</v>

3977
03:06:40.431 --> 03:06:42.350
<v Speaker 4>I apologize if I'm Wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but either way,</v>

3978
03:06:42.351 --> 03:06:45.220
<v Speaker 4>he's a super respected.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know he's great.</v>

3979
03:06:45.230 --> 03:06:50.230
<v Speaker 4>He's got a gracie ngayon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>super respected jujitsu instructor and </v>

3980
03:06:50.230 --> 03:06:54.191
<v Speaker 4>competitor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so he's got this giant Bodybuilder in </v>

3981
03:06:54.191 --> 03:06:54.560
<v Speaker 4>front of him and he's like side kicking </v>
<v Speaker 4>him in the thigh.</v>

3982
03:06:54.680 --> 03:06:56.040
<v Speaker 4>This is so old school.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I</v>

3983
03:06:56.040 --> 03:07:01.040
<v Speaker 1>wish I knew what year this was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he keeps hitting him with his front </v>

3984
03:07:01.040 --> 03:07:03.150
<v Speaker 1>legs because even thought he's way small</v>
<v Speaker 1>than this guy and the bodybuilder yet to</v>

3985
03:07:03.151 --> 03:07:08.151
<v Speaker 1>move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now he tries to make his move and he </v>

3986
03:07:08.151 --> 03:07:09.831
<v Speaker 1>throws a punch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it didn't work in and pedro sauer </v>

3987
03:07:09.831 --> 03:07:10.770
<v Speaker 1>starts jacking him with punches and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy takes him down.</v>

3988
03:07:10.950 --> 03:07:14.250
<v Speaker 1>So now when the guy takes him down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pedro sauer immediately sweeps him,</v>

3989
03:07:14.580 --> 03:07:19.580
<v Speaker 1>mounts on them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that the dude rolled him over at </v>

3990
03:07:19.580 --> 03:07:20.190
<v Speaker 1>least one time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but pedro didn't really take any damage.</v>

3991
03:07:20.191 --> 03:07:25.191
<v Speaker 1>You see how good like a real legit </v>
<v Speaker 1>brazilian jujitsu practitioner is at </v>

3992
03:07:26.341 --> 03:07:31.341
<v Speaker 1>protecting himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then especially the fact that he's </v>

3993
03:07:31.341 --> 03:07:33.501
<v Speaker 1>wearing a gi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is even better because he can </v>

3994
03:07:33.501 --> 03:07:33.501
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though the other guy is,</v>

3995
03:07:33.501 --> 03:07:35.040
<v Speaker 1>he's bare chested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if pedro's we're an aggie,</v>

3996
03:07:35.250 --> 03:07:37.830
<v Speaker 1>he can control the guy because it's all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's grippy,</v>

3997
03:07:38.080 --> 03:07:43.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the allows you to hold onto a big </v>

3998
03:07:43.080 --> 03:07:45.231
<v Speaker 1>fucking sweaty gorilla like this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he eventually catches homeboy in an </v>

3999
03:07:45.231 --> 03:07:46.770
<v Speaker 1>arm bar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same video I saw it,</v>

4000
03:07:47.100 --> 03:07:49.190
<v Speaker 1>but it's just pretty much idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4001
03:07:49.500 --> 03:07:51.540
<v Speaker 1>I want to say this was like 95 or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

4002
03:07:52.350 --> 03:07:55.170
<v Speaker 1>So he's holding onto the dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does it say?</v>

4003
03:07:56.530 --> 03:07:59.530
<v Speaker 1>what does it say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy was 92,</v>

4004
03:07:59.531 --> 03:08:04.531
<v Speaker 1>mr Utah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I thought I thought it was in </v>

4005
03:08:04.531 --> 03:08:04.531
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] 92.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4006
03:08:04.531 --> 03:08:04.600
<v Speaker 1>pedro sauer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's in Utah.</v>

4007
03:08:04.601 --> 03:08:08.200
<v Speaker 1>I think he's a salt lake city guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure I might be wrong,</v>

4008
03:08:09.040 --> 03:08:10.570
<v Speaker 1>but in either way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pedro sauer,</v>

4009
03:08:10.571 --> 03:08:15.571
<v Speaker 1>super respected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very a very high level jujitsu </v>

4010
03:08:15.571 --> 03:08:15.571
<v Speaker 1>instructor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of blood here.</v>

4011
03:08:15.571 --> 03:08:17.290
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's got the blood?</v>

4012
03:08:17.870 --> 03:08:18.760
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit.</v>

4013
03:08:18.761 --> 03:08:21.760
<v Speaker 1>Armbar son.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he.</v>

4014
03:08:21.880 --> 03:08:25.510
<v Speaker 1>He made that dude's fucking nose explode</v>
<v Speaker 1>before your arm barred him.</v>

4015
03:08:27.710 --> 03:08:29.510
<v Speaker 1>Is that guys face a bloody mess?</v>

4016
03:08:30.680 --> 03:08:31.390
<v Speaker 16>Really?</v>

4017
03:08:31.900 --> 03:08:32.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4018
03:08:32.651 --> 03:08:34.000
<v Speaker 1>there It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the blood.</v>

4019
03:08:34.090 --> 03:08:36.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He punched him in the nose and choke the</v>

4020
03:08:36.071 --> 03:08:37.900
<v Speaker 1>shit out of him and then took his.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Took his arm,</v>

4021
03:08:38.480 --> 03:08:42.160
<v Speaker 1>old school son,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the difference in strength and size,</v>

4022
03:08:42.220 --> 03:08:45.070
<v Speaker 1>pretty substantial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did you say?</v>

4023
03:08:45.580 --> 03:08:50.580
<v Speaker 1>Mine was obviously one of those facebook</v>
<v Speaker 1>videos I guess who wins when you </v>

4024
03:08:50.580 --> 03:08:54.850
<v Speaker 1>progress wrestler versus a bodybuilder </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the bodybuilder was just this huge </v>

4025
03:08:54.850 --> 03:08:57.520
<v Speaker 1>monster bodybuilder and the rest are </v>
<v Speaker 1>just had no problem.</v>

4026
03:08:57.521 --> 03:08:59.530
<v Speaker 1>Just throwing them on the ground </v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly.</v>

4027
03:08:59.620 --> 03:09:04.620
<v Speaker 1>Just it was just wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was an mma but it wasn't a pro </v>

4028
03:09:04.620 --> 03:09:04.620
<v Speaker 1>wrestler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You said progress or was it just like.</v>

4029
03:09:04.620 --> 03:09:05.340
<v Speaker 1>Just like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4030
03:09:05.400 --> 03:09:07.540
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I'm not a progress wrestler.</v>

4031
03:09:07.541 --> 03:09:09.610
<v Speaker 1>Like a professional wrestler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like s like oh,</v>

4032
03:09:09.611 --> 03:09:11.050
<v Speaker 1>like someone is an expert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Expert.</v>

4033
03:09:11.710 --> 03:09:12.370
<v Speaker 1>Expert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4034
03:09:13.420 --> 03:09:16.660
<v Speaker 1>Progress was used to be real wrestlers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like not that they're not now.</v>

4035
03:09:16.690 --> 03:09:19.180
<v Speaker 1>Now they're more real entertainers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they can wrestle.</v>

4036
03:09:19.181 --> 03:09:24.181
<v Speaker 1>Obviously brock lesnar can wrestle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the original days of progressing it </v>

4037
03:09:24.181 --> 03:09:25.810
<v Speaker 1>wasn't fake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is the weirdest thing.</v>

4038
03:09:26.170 --> 03:09:30.670
<v Speaker 1>That is the only sport that's a sport in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fucking olympics,</v>

4039
03:09:31.000 --> 03:09:35.170
<v Speaker 1>but in the professional world it's fake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I say fake,</v>

4040
03:09:35.260 --> 03:09:37.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean it disrespectfully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

4041
03:09:37.140 --> 03:09:40.570
<v Speaker 1>joked around about progressing a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>progressing fans.</v>

4042
03:09:40.571 --> 03:09:42.280
<v Speaker 1>Got super butthurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

4043
03:09:42.310 --> 03:09:46.180
<v Speaker 1>I absolutely respect the athletes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>their abilities and what they're doing.</v>

4044
03:09:46.600 --> 03:09:49.030
<v Speaker 1>I like to fuck with tony hinchcliffe </v>
<v Speaker 1>folks.</v>

4045
03:09:49.240 --> 03:09:50.290
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fun.</v>

4046
03:09:50.590 --> 03:09:54.100
<v Speaker 1>He loves wrestling a little too much and</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you burned along with</v>

4047
03:09:54.100 --> 03:09:55.330
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm so sorry,</v>

4048
03:09:55.690 --> 03:09:58.210
<v Speaker 4>but my honest feelings about pro </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrestling as I.</v>

4049
03:09:58.330 --> 03:10:03.330
<v Speaker 4>It disturbs me that guys who are so good</v>
<v Speaker 4>and women who are so good at wrestling </v>

4050
03:10:04.870 --> 03:10:09.870
<v Speaker 4>don't have a professional venue for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're wrestling is so exciting on an </v>

4051
03:10:09.870 --> 03:10:13.120
<v Speaker 4>amateur level.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas like tennis players have massive</v>

4052
03:10:13.121 --> 03:10:18.121
<v Speaker 4>opportunities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody else has massive </v>

4053
03:10:18.121 --> 03:10:18.121
<v Speaker 4>opportunities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4054
03:10:18.121 --> 03:10:21.570
<v Speaker 4>I guess swimming doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but a lot of like big time sports have </v>

4055
03:10:21.570 --> 03:10:21.570
<v Speaker 4>these huge opportunities,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what?</v>

4056
03:10:21.570 --> 03:10:26.371
<v Speaker 4>Swimming doesn't have his amateur </v>
<v Speaker 4>swimming and then fake swimming where </v>

4057
03:10:26.710 --> 03:10:28.660
<v Speaker 4>they're like rolling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's got jello.</v>

4058

<v Speaker 4>He got the job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>all ladies and gentlemen,</v>

03:13:29.970 --> 03:13:31.760
<v Speaker 4>You would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you would watch the internet show,</v>

<v Speaker 4>his podcast,</v>

4128
03:13:47.540 --> 03:13:52.540
<v Speaker 4>I don't even follow the nfl,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when he starts making fun of people </v>

4129
03:13:52.540 --> 03:13:55.280
<v Speaker 4>of the in the nfl and talking about fans</v>
<v Speaker 4>and stuff on his podcast,</v>

4130
03:13:55.640 --> 03:14:00.640
<v Speaker 4>it's hilarious if someone wises up and </v>
<v Speaker 4>gives bill burr some sort of a platform,</v>

4131
03:14:01.671 --> 03:14:05.540
<v Speaker 4>a gigantic platform reviewing football.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my god,</v>

4132
03:14:05.800 --> 03:14:09.800
<v Speaker 4>everybody else has done carl because he </v>
<v Speaker 4>knows his shit too.</v>

4133
03:14:10.160 --> 03:14:12.800
<v Speaker 4>Like bill burr understands football.</v>

4134
03:14:12.950 --> 03:14:14.300
<v Speaker 4>Like when I listened to them like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

4135
03:14:14.301 --> 03:14:17.090
<v Speaker 4>this guy is not just like a comedian </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking shit about stuff.</v>

4136
03:14:17.420 --> 03:14:22.420
<v Speaker 4>he actually understands football.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can listen to them talk about </v>

4137
03:14:22.420 --> 03:14:22.420
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love that dude.</v>

4138
03:14:22.850 --> 03:14:24.080
<v Speaker 4>He's an american treasure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck.</v>

4139
03:14:24.090 --> 03:14:27.680
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's more like the delivery method has</v>

4140
03:14:27.830 --> 03:14:30.010
<v Speaker 4>outpaced.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

4141
03:14:31.100 --> 03:14:34.910
<v Speaker 4>Content.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess it's eliminated the necessity of</v>

4142
03:14:34.911 --> 03:14:39.911
<v Speaker 4>a large studio.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like a friend of mine was going to do </v>

4143
03:14:39.911 --> 03:14:39.911
<v Speaker 4>something on the internet recently and </v>
<v Speaker 4>he's like,</v>

4144
03:14:40.430 --> 03:14:42.820
<v Speaker 4>this group wants to pay me money to be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4145
03:14:42.890 --> 03:14:44.870
<v Speaker 4>to be associated with this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I go,</v>

4146
03:14:44.900 --> 03:14:46.460
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are you going to do it on?</v>

4147
03:14:46.520 --> 03:14:51.520
<v Speaker 4>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to do it on youtube and my </v>

4148
03:14:51.520 --> 03:14:51.520
<v Speaker 4>uncle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4149
03:14:51.520 --> 03:14:54.430
<v Speaker 4>why would you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why would you want someone coming along </v>

4150
03:14:54.430 --> 03:14:55.310
<v Speaker 4>and being a part of that when you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>just do it yourself.</v>

4151
03:14:55.400 --> 03:14:56.000
<v Speaker 4>Like if you get.</v>

4152
03:14:56.240 --> 03:15:01.240
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you get in bed with this person or </v>

4153
03:15:01.240 --> 03:15:01.700
<v Speaker 4>this group,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a media conglomerate,</v>

4154
03:15:01.730 --> 03:15:06.730
<v Speaker 4>you get a bed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this media conglomerate with your </v>

4155
03:15:06.730 --> 03:15:06.730
<v Speaker 4>project that you're trying to launch </v>
<v Speaker 4>online,</v>

4156
03:15:06.730 --> 03:15:07.970
<v Speaker 4>you're going to be relieved as some of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the financial burden.</v>

4157
03:15:08.480 --> 03:15:12.140
<v Speaker 4>But in this case I was talking to a guy </v>
<v Speaker 4>is not hurting for money.</v>

4158
03:15:12.170 --> 03:15:17.170
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not talking about a substantial </v>

4159
03:15:17.170 --> 03:15:17.170
<v Speaker 4>investment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you need?</v>

4160
03:15:17.170 --> 03:15:17.390
<v Speaker 4>You need a camera.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You need to an employee,</v>

4161
03:15:17.600 --> 03:15:20.420
<v Speaker 4>you need an upload place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You need to send out.</v>

4162
03:15:20.450 --> 03:15:23.270
<v Speaker 4>You need something like youtube is </v>
<v Speaker 4>essentially free.</v>

4163
03:15:23.271 --> 03:15:24.800
<v Speaker 4>You just need a good internet </v>
<v Speaker 4>connection.</v>

4164
03:15:24.801 --> 03:15:29.801
<v Speaker 4>Good computers like the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the price of entry is not exorbitant in </v>

4165
03:15:29.801 --> 03:15:34.211
<v Speaker 4>relationship to the potential.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you get involved with some sort </v>

4166
03:15:34.211 --> 03:15:35.870
<v Speaker 4>of a media conglomerate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these guys,</v>

4167
03:15:36.230 --> 03:15:41.230
<v Speaker 4>all of these people are very smart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All these people that are involved in </v>

4168
03:15:41.230 --> 03:15:43.160
<v Speaker 4>all these different networks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have existed for the longest time.</v>

4169
03:15:43.190 --> 03:15:48.190
<v Speaker 4>They are the old vampire versions of </v>
<v Speaker 4>hollywood like they've existed forever </v>

4170
03:15:48.190 --> 03:15:52.900
<v Speaker 4>and they've grown up in this and some of</v>
<v Speaker 4>them have come along in different </v>

4171
03:15:52.900 --> 03:15:54.960
<v Speaker 4>transitionary phase of the system,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they realize right now the system is</v>

4172
03:15:54.961 --> 03:15:59.190
<v Speaker 4>in jeopardy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's in a very strange place because the</v>

4173
03:15:59.191 --> 03:16:03.180
<v Speaker 4>internet is slowly becoming more and </v>
<v Speaker 4>more prevalent in people's lives.</v>

4174
03:16:03.181 --> 03:16:08.181
<v Speaker 4>It's consuming more and more people's </v>
<v Speaker 4>entertainment time and it's becoming </v>

4175
03:16:08.181 --> 03:16:12.231
<v Speaker 4>more powerful and its abilities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The ability that someone has today is </v>

4176
03:16:12.231 --> 03:16:13.290
<v Speaker 4>what you can create an edit on a </v>
<v Speaker 4>computer.</v>

4177
03:16:13.530 --> 03:16:18.530
<v Speaker 4>It's literally getting to the point </v>
<v Speaker 4>where I could make a movie with you and </v>

4178
03:16:18.530 --> 03:16:21.801
<v Speaker 4>you don't even have to be in it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can just decide I'm going to make </v>

4179
03:16:21.801 --> 03:16:23.260
<v Speaker 4>fucking slumber party 10 with jamie </v>
<v Speaker 4>vernon and slow.</v>

<v Speaker 4>fucking pizza delivery outfit on and 15 </v>

4183
03:16:32.930 --> 03:16:36.910
<v Speaker 4>this 100 percent possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the only like 10 years away from </v>

4184
03:16:36.910 --> 03:16:36.910
<v Speaker 4>now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

<v Speaker 4>things online.</v>

4186
03:16:39.990 --> 03:16:44.990
<v Speaker 4>You're going to be able to create a film</v>
<v Speaker 4>with a regular laptop in a fucking phone</v>

4187
03:16:46.051 --> 03:16:47.760
<v Speaker 4>and it's going to look like a goddamn </v>
<v Speaker 4>movie.</v>

4188
03:16:47.761 --> 03:16:48.990
<v Speaker 4>People have probably already done it.</v>

4189
03:16:49.460 --> 03:16:51.560
<v Speaker 7>snapchat filters,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so there's a good example.</v>

<v Speaker 7>If you do it right now I can make a </v>

<v Speaker 7>Exactly.</v>

4192
03:16:55.250 --> 03:17:00.250

<v Speaker 7>talking about really that they used the </v>

4193
03:17:00.250 --> 03:17:03.371
<v Speaker 7>example of the new peewee herman movie </v>

03:17:03.371 --> 03:17:06.731
<v Speaker 7>what he should be throughout the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but they article describes how there's </v>
