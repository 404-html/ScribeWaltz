1
00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:07.460
Oh,

All right.
Hold on guys.
I got to do a commercial,

2
00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.790
the Joe Rogan experience podcast.
First of all.
Hello.
Hi,
my friends.

3
00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.960
The Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by the fleshlight.
Um,

4
00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.350
these guys are not just the sponsors.
We've actually hung out with them.

5
00:00:21.351 --> 00:00:24.160
We are friends with them.
They're nice people,
and they make a,

6
00:00:24.161 --> 00:00:28.370
a solid product from masturbation.
The number one sex toy from men in the world.

7
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.230
If you go to Joe rogan.net and enter in the code name Rogan under the fleshlight

8
00:00:33.231 --> 00:00:37.670
link,

with that said,
here we go.

9
00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.640
Buckle up.
Bitches.
Shit's about to get freaky.

10
00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:44.390
The Joe Rogan experience.

11
00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:52.970
<v 3>Yes.</v>

12
00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.530
<v 2>You know,
people complain about that drum thing in the beginning that don't,</v>

13
00:01:05.531 --> 00:01:09.890
don't smash the complaining man,
that fucks in my hearing.
Dude does it.

14
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.190
I don't like it.
It makes me,
blows my speakers up.

15
00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.000
It's there to let you know you're alive.
Wake up and you know,

16
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.750
waiting to let you know it's uncomfortable.
Yeah.
It doesn't feel right.

17
00:01:19.751 --> 00:01:22.870
It doesn't sound good.
It's sort of hook that would be better than then.

18
00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.280
Then you just talking like,
hi,
I'm here.
Maybe I'll come on.
Maybe that's better.

19
00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.880
No.
Is there a better term beat is there is no better.
No better.

20
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.910
There's no better.
Ladies and gentleman that drove.
He was tight man.

21
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Brian Whittaker and Darryl writer in the house.
Ladies and gentlemen.

22
00:01:37.001 --> 00:01:38.100
What's up guy?
Too?

23
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.000
Mad savages attacking the comedy scene in Los Angeles out there.

24
00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.740
Fucking making shit happen.

25
00:01:44.741 --> 00:01:49.350
You guys in the grinder out there whiten and scratching.

26
00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.030
Yeah.
First of all,
thank you for having me on it.

27
00:01:52.031 --> 00:01:53.920
They should be and on my friend Doug.
I appreciate it.

28
00:01:53.921 --> 00:01:57.640
I'm glad you're both here and it's funny.
Well,
it's accidental that Brian's here.

29
00:01:57.641 --> 00:02:00.620
Like Joe was like,
who the fuck is that?
I'm I no.
I'm like,
Oh darn.

30
00:02:00.621 --> 00:02:03.550
I might've brought some crazy friend.
No,
always at blog.

31
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.330
We want to pull my friend to see your face,
man.
I saw the sunlight and it's like,

32
00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.220
but the last time we had someone here,

33
00:02:09.221 --> 00:02:12.130
Pito Hanson brought his wife and she just started talking while we're in the

34
00:02:12.131 --> 00:02:14.200
middle of conversation and we had to give her a microphone.

35
00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.350
I haven't met her man.
She's nice.
She's nice.
She's nice,
but it was,

36
00:02:17.351 --> 00:02:20.590
but it was squirrelly.
Yeah.
He's like,
he's attached Bro.

37
00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.130
There's dudes that are attached to their wives and some days you never see that

38
00:02:24.131 --> 00:02:27.730
mother fucker without her.
It's like this is the unit.
They come as a unit.

39
00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.270
They don't,
they don't come individually.
It is what it is,
man.

40
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.160
It's your turn to talk,
but that's like roughing Atlanta now.
Yes.
Yes.

41
00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.060
That's like Ralphie and Latin and then
they're like attached at the hip.
She,

42
00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.010
yeah,
she's a sweetheart.
But you don't see Brian.

43
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.320
Is his microphone nylon or something?
Yeah,
it's fine.
It's just that he's so calm.

44
00:02:47.321 --> 00:02:52.150
I just,
I,
yeah.
How's that?
Yeah,
but Darrell's Darryl's doesn't sound right.

45
00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.500
It doesn't sound right to me either,
but yeah.
No,
I was thinking it now.

46
00:02:56.501 --> 00:03:00.070
It does now does.
Okay.
Okay.
Folks at home.

47
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.860
<v 4>What the fuck at all this time over a year,</v>

48
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.070
trying to get our technical fucking shit.
[inaudible] work with us.

49
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.610
I had technical envy when I went to Adam Carolla's place.

50
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.960
I went to Adelaide for his house to do the podcast down.

51
00:03:11.961 --> 00:03:15.250
Motherfuckers got his shit wired.
I'm an amateur man.

52
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.090
He's got stacks of compressors.
I mean stacks of audio.

53
00:03:19.091 --> 00:03:21.790
Compressor's not just one,
but we don't even have one.

54
00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.100
If when it gets loud and hurts your ears,
sorry,
someone's schooling,

55
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.980
you'll fuck when he starts going off.

56
00:03:29.981 --> 00:03:33.960
I have Brian has to dive on the microphone thing.
It's like a staff is what?

57
00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.940
How many of you would you say that a lot of people working for him?

58
00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.680
He's doing like
12 jobs right now.
You're not.

59
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.840
Adam does totally different set up.
First of all,
unimpressed people

60
00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.130
after ghetto ghetto as fuck.

61
00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.900
He's got people working like the cameras.

62
00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.930
He's got like individual cameras on each individual person and then someone

63
00:03:55.931 --> 00:03:58.540
manning a switch inside,
so there's a person who does that.

64
00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.630
Then there's a person who looks up stuff on the web and pulls it up.

65
00:04:01.631 --> 00:04:04.390
As you're talking about it.
So like I have to Google shit myself.

66
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.810
He's got to do to pull shit up on some giant big screen and then he's got a

67
00:04:07.811 --> 00:04:11.560
sound effects board,
which is,
that was the one thing that I would cut.

68
00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.410
You're like in the middle of the conversation that dude hits buttons and it

69
00:04:14.411 --> 00:04:16.820
sounds like a jail cell close and another one sounds good.

70
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.550
<v 5>Dork man.
He,
he uh,</v>

71
00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:23.580
he does his podcast club and it's like an hour and a half set up.

72
00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:27.750
It's tight.
Like if people go to see it live,
it's fucking wild,

73
00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.900
wild west.
Wild.
That mother fucker can go off on anything.

74
00:04:32.901 --> 00:04:36.230
He went off on the public school system in la by the time he was done,

75
00:04:36.231 --> 00:04:40.460
I was ready to vote for mayor.
I'll register.
You're the mayor now.

76
00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:45.030
You're the mayor of La.
The last time that you voted?
I voted for Obama.
Okay.

77
00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.380
Ahead.

78
00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.690
<v 4>I didn't,
I'm not happy about it now.
Now I just feel like I got duped.</v>

79
00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.540
I feel like a dumb ass.
I feel like it's all the same.
I just feel like I,

80
00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.580
I went against my own thinking on all this stuff I've always said I'll take,

81
00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.460
so like pro wrestling,
you know,
it might make you feel like you're,
you know,

82
00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.710
you're doing you and you're rooting on pro wrestling.

83
00:05:02.711 --> 00:05:05.260
You might feel like you're participating but I don't really think it counts.

84
00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:09.240
<v 5>I think you got to kind of give them a break and you know like for at yard at</v>

85
00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:13.830
never that don't know me.
Joe knows me.
Race is not an issue with me.

86
00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.080
Like I'm,
I'm a Nascar Fan.

87
00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.530
I'm a country music fan so it ain't one of those things.

88
00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.110
But I think in this particular case it's,

89
00:05:22.111 --> 00:05:25.800
he's the first black president and he doesn't want to overstep his bounds.

90
00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.180
That's what I'm hoping that it is.
Well that's silly.

91
00:05:28.181 --> 00:05:32.580
He fucking treading really lightly because he's like,

92
00:05:32.581 --> 00:05:34.230
he's like really treading really lightly.

93
00:05:34.231 --> 00:05:37.650
Cause what he should've said when he first got in and people started bitching,

94
00:05:37.651 --> 00:05:42.150
it's calm the fuck down.
I'm cleaning up some of Nigga Shit.
I give me some time.

95
00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.260
He hasn't even done that man.
He hasn't even fucking,
he hasn't really,

96
00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.450
he hasn't really stepped on nothing,
man.

97
00:05:48.451 --> 00:05:51.450
He's been walking around real light like he ain't

98
00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:58.310
fucking Libya.
I mean like he's got this whole new,
well now I'm offended.

99
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.590
I'm offended that we're even talking about this.

100
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:04.320
Like we're even pretending we have a fucking clue.
Oh,
I can't vote.

101
00:06:04.321 --> 00:06:08.240
So it's mad speculation.
I don't really care cause I can't vote.

102
00:06:08.241 --> 00:06:12.550
So either way it don't matter to me man.
Darrell done some bad things and

103
00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:17.650
I know that's coming.
I wonder why I'm asking Joey Diaz is that,

104
00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:21.700
let's talk about what should we know about the Joey does is act.
It was an,

105
00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:26.660
I can't vote mother.
All right.
I got some money.
Get fucked up,
man.

106
00:06:26.661 --> 00:06:27.060
I don't,

107
00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.520
<v 1>no.
Whether Obama's real or not,
I don't know.
I don't know what it is.</v>

108
00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:33.330
But all this Wall Street shit watching inside job and reading all of them.

109
00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:37.430
You Know Matt Taibbi is,
he's a writer for rolling stone.
He really know.

110
00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.960
He's bright,
some independent stuff too,
but he's,
he breaks,

111
00:06:39.961 --> 00:06:43.720
he's brilliant articles for rolling stone where he sort of like details the

112
00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:48.210
depths of the corruption that's involved in the financial institution.

113
00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:51.300
And it's like,
wait a minute.
First of all,
if this is true,

114
00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:54.840
how the fuck is this the only guy talking about this man,

115
00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:58.140
how is this the only guy screaming in the streets?
How was Matt,

116
00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:02.040
Matt Taibbi the only bad motherfucker who's writing these articles?

117
00:07:02.041 --> 00:07:03.910
It's exposing everything.
I mean there's,

118
00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.330
there's the guys who made that inside job movie.

119
00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:10.700
There's Matt Taibbi and then where the fuck are the politicians were all of

120
00:07:10.701 --> 00:07:11.070
these guys,

121
00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:15.320
<v 5>why they getting paid?
Like it's,
it's money,
it's money.
It's about money.</v>

122
00:07:15.321 --> 00:07:18.920
For example,
of corruption we've ever seen.
Sure.
About money.

123
00:07:18.921 --> 00:07:23.921
And the whole funny part is just like you would tell somebody to put a weed

124
00:07:24.141 --> 00:07:28.640
dealer in jail,
the first Wall Street dude that has to do hard time.

125
00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:32.530
It's over with.
They,
they will,
they will stop doing this shit.
So crazy.
No,

126
00:07:32.531 --> 00:07:33.850
they want to start killing people.

127
00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:36.740
That's what they'll start doing and start killing people that put people in
jail.

128
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:39.860
Cops will come up missing,
dude,
these are what you're talking about.

129
00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:45.020
Level of dollars here you're talking about money that's beyond our

130
00:07:45.021 --> 00:07:46.100
comprehension.
You're,

131
00:07:46.101 --> 00:07:49.640
you're getting into like where guys are getting fired because their bank failed

132
00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:52.460
and they're getting hundreds of millions of dollars in bonuses.

133
00:07:52.461 --> 00:07:55.900
What that does it,
it's just,
it doesn't make sense.
Now see,

134
00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:57.950
y'all are awesome deeper thinking than I am.

135
00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:01.430
When is it that people are going to just grabbed the pitch forks and start

136
00:08:01.431 --> 00:08:02.400
chopping these dudes is

137
00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.190
<v 1>no,
as long as they're comfortable man,</v>

138
00:08:04.191 --> 00:08:07.520
as long as there's enough comfort where people can sleep and they can watch

139
00:08:07.521 --> 00:08:10.060
cable and they can get fucking Wendy's,
you know,

140
00:08:10.061 --> 00:08:13.430
and get the double cheeseburger and as long as that it's all there for them.

141
00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:14.780
People aren't going to freak out.

142
00:08:14.781 --> 00:08:18.800
When shit gets bad is when people don't have food.
When people don't have gas,

143
00:08:18.801 --> 00:08:21.200
when people then then riots in the streets happened.

144
00:08:21.201 --> 00:08:24.650
As long as they can keep the infrastructure up and keep supermarkets stuffed and

145
00:08:24.651 --> 00:08:28.730
keep a reasonable amount of jobs available,
they can just keep fucking us

146
00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:32.160
<v 6>being the fucking increase lately and uh,</v>

147
00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:35.610
and these asshole bumps or drive up with a car like asking you for spare change

148
00:08:35.611 --> 00:08:36.840
at the fucking gas station.

149
00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.960
Like got a guy pull up in a car accident with her chin.
No,
they fucking,

150
00:08:39.961 --> 00:08:42.570
they want money from you to make their cargo further there.

151
00:08:42.571 --> 00:08:47.550
They're begging you at the gas station now from a car on a road trip,
road trip.

152
00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:50.350
Especially at imagine it happens real bad in la.
No,
no.

153
00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:54.820
He's saying what he's saying is that's a sad story out of mine.

154
00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:56.010
Oh yeah.
Well

155
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:58.970
<v 4>yeah,
I'm stranded.
Blah Blah Blah.
[inaudible] from home.
Go the fuck back.</v>

156
00:08:58.971 --> 00:09:00.310
You know what I'm saying?
I'm homeless.
Put on,

157
00:09:00.311 --> 00:09:03.540
I'm talking about just guys who want money to make their cargo further.

158
00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:05.280
That's it.
They just pull up,

159
00:09:05.281 --> 00:09:08.130
they pull into a gas station and they stay there and they take up a pump and

160
00:09:08.131 --> 00:09:10.130
they just want your fucking money.
They're just asking any,

161
00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:14.630
I've never seen this once.
Oh No,
maybe I live in the right.

162
00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:19.050
So you guys are getting an asked at the gas station.
Oh,
all the time.

163
00:09:19.051 --> 00:09:21.750
This is the way I know more lately.
Fuck.
Do you live?

164
00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:24.540
I live off of an album around,
yeah,
the Brown Franklin like by the,

165
00:09:24.541 --> 00:09:27.330
by the Capitol records building.
Okay,
so you're,
you're in the hood.
You're,

166
00:09:27.331 --> 00:09:28.590
I mean in Hollywood.

167
00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:36.050
I didn't mean the hood.
You know,
you're writing the hardest things.
Trainee,

168
00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:40.310
Boulevard,
Trendy,
whatever.
You know what man,
you're,

169
00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:43.310
that's one of the things in white guys.
Brown

170
00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:46.053
that's never happened

171
00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:49.900
<v 7>for money.
Not like that dog.
Like they,</v>

172
00:09:49.901 --> 00:09:52.920
they might hit me up for like change the fucking,
get something to drink,

173
00:09:52.921 --> 00:09:56.240
but just drive your car up to the gas station.
They asked about somebody.

174
00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:59.580
<v 4>Oh.
And they take up the damn pump and they stay there until they get something.</v>

175
00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:04.880
Somebody would have been slapped me up for money at Disneyland when I was

176
00:10:05.161 --> 00:10:10.130
carrying my kid in Disneyland.
Comes,
comes up to me and he's in Disneyland too.

177
00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:14.270
Yeah,
he's in Disneyland to tells me some story about his parents.
I could do it.

178
00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:17.700
Get the fuck Outta here.
Fuck do some young kid.

179
00:10:17.701 --> 00:10:22.080
He's like 19 and 20 years old and he came up to me and just with this fucking

180
00:10:22.081 --> 00:10:25.850
stupid story about his parents and he needs to get them somewhere and then

181
00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:30.750
there's short did he knows I have no idea what he knew.
I didn't want to hear it.

182
00:10:30.751 --> 00:10:32.070
I was like,
this is retarded.

183
00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:34.650
You know you need to get a fucking job or shut the fuck up.

184
00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:35.700
It's one or the other.
Either you're,

185
00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:38.850
you're ripping people off because you're faking all this story or you need to

186
00:10:38.851 --> 00:10:40.470
get your shit together and that's part of life.

187
00:10:40.471 --> 00:10:42.330
You don't always have your shit together from the get go.

188
00:10:42.331 --> 00:10:43.350
And when you're short on money,

189
00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:47.360
sometimes you have to have peanut butter sandwiches or roll pennies,
assholes.

190
00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:50.070
If the gas stations that you guys apparently never had to deal with,

191
00:10:50.071 --> 00:10:51.800
I don't know,
in case anybody else has theirs.
Listen,

192
00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:54.330
it's like if you can't afford a fucking car,
you know,

193
00:10:54.331 --> 00:10:59.100
just get a bigger car called a fucking bus.
People were out there on the ground,

194
00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:02.850
work for my car too.

195
00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:07.480
<v 7>What are the things that I think that I go through and I've been blessed in that</v>

196
00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:10.450
type of concept is just what you're,
you're saying?

197
00:11:10.451 --> 00:11:12.790
And that's personal responsibility.

198
00:11:12.791 --> 00:11:16.840
Like it's no secret I fucked up earlier but

199
00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:23.400
I shot a crackhead head.
What's the story?
What happened?
Okay.

200
00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:26.650
You want to get a job?
You want to hit a real story?

201
00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:30.790
I want to both give me the joke first joke.
It did not ruin it.
Well anyway,

202
00:11:30.791 --> 00:11:32.890
tell me the real story and then tell me the jug.
It won't be as good.
Right.

203
00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:35.590
You know what the joke is?
The real story.

204
00:11:35.591 --> 00:11:39.940
What happened was I was selling dope back in DC and uh,
this guy,

205
00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:42.160
I had fronted him some front of them,

206
00:11:42.161 --> 00:11:46.300
some dope actually it was crack and it was,
it was a crack head.

207
00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:50.020
And like he was across the street from me and my boys and we were drunk on his

208
00:11:50.021 --> 00:11:50.980
patio,
his shit,

209
00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:53.990
and he was across the street and I was like getting my money motherfucker

210
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:57.700
<v 5>drunk and leeway like high high and this one and this jackass is going to say</v>

211
00:11:57.701 --> 00:11:59.290
fuck you ain't paying you shit.

212
00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:03.850
I think he owed me like $10 so all of my boys was,
we were like,
oh,

213
00:12:03.851 --> 00:12:05.730
she's just going to let that crack here and talk to you like yeah,

214
00:12:05.731 --> 00:12:08.050
and I'm drunk with a fucking gun.

215
00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:12.110
So I shot across the street to scare this motherfucker,
but I hit him dope.

216
00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:17.560
Yet the rest is history.
Wow.
How old were you then?
I was,

217
00:12:17.561 --> 00:12:20.950
let's see,
I was 25 when that happened.
God Damn.

218
00:12:20.951 --> 00:12:23.170
Did you realize after you pull the trigger where you like,

219
00:12:23.171 --> 00:12:27.250
what the fuck am I doing?
Okay.
I didn't kill him.
I just shot his ass.

220
00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:29.860
I still didn't think like,
what the fuck am I doing?
I just shot a guy.

221
00:12:29.861 --> 00:12:34.450
It didn't know I was too drunk.
How drunk now when you,

222
00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:38.740
how long were you selling crack for?
How many years?
Crack like year and a half.

223
00:12:38.741 --> 00:12:42.850
But I was selling drugs,
like all types of drugs,
like just exclusively cracked,

224
00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:46.480
like a year and a half.
I don't know man.

225
00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:49.920
Like did you like listen to too many ice tea song?
No,
it had,

226
00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:54.340
it had nothing to do with fucking rap music and nothing.
It was just like,

227
00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:59.230
this is the thing that pisses me off.
And uh,
uh,

228
00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:03.160
the,
the culture that you come from,

229
00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:07.120
it's no,
well not me.
I mean not you but me.

230
00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:12.190
The culture tries to dictate that you can't do nothing but certain things and be

231
00:13:12.191 --> 00:13:15.700
successful.
Now I'm not a dumb motherfucker as y'all know,
cause you,

232
00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:17.350
cause you've heard my county and stuff like that,

233
00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:19.630
but that's a pretty bold of you.

234
00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:25.580
But it is like,
you know what,
when you're a certain age,

235
00:13:25.581 --> 00:13:29.110
just talk about shooting a crack head and it didn't really bother you that much

236
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:32.020
and then you're like,
I'm obviously very intelligent.
You guys know this.

237
00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:37.330
Fucking you gotta look at yourself piece mark.

238
00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:39.010
Cause I only did two years for that shit.

239
00:13:39.011 --> 00:13:41.130
So Ryan and I are the only people that are high right now.

240
00:13:41.131 --> 00:13:43.250
We'll just want to let you know folks at home.
Go on.

241
00:13:43.251 --> 00:13:46.180
There's two different frequencies going on here.
Yeah,
it's Sarah.

242
00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:49.360
I got Darrel high once and I was half of four fucking days.

243
00:13:49.361 --> 00:13:52.990
Like I'm using smoking dirt weed and Joe got the good shit.
Him and Ralph.

244
00:13:52.991 --> 00:13:56.590
He had that good shit.
We put them on Pluto.
I was,

245
00:13:56.740 --> 00:14:01.060
I think I was seeing shit like I was talking to people that was dead and having

246
00:14:01.061 --> 00:14:04.670
a conversation with them.
Just chilling dog.
Oh,

247
00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:07.400
that's some superman shit that he smokes,
man.
I don't,

248
00:14:07.401 --> 00:14:11.170
I'm not used to that shit dog.
I can't fuck with that.
It's the real weed,
bro.

249
00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:13.330
That's the real we'd done.
Other stuff is fake.

250
00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:18.430
That other stuff was just to get you to find the real weed.
It's good.

251
00:14:18.431 --> 00:14:22.150
The other stuff is like,
wow,
this feels kind of good.
Well,
I'm Kinda hungry,
Paul.

252
00:14:22.151 --> 00:14:27.100
Things are so funny.
I'm giggling.
He,
I was like,
this is not a kind of weed.

253
00:14:27.101 --> 00:14:30.580
This weeds called train wreck.
No,
it was 40 I wasn't laughing at Shit.

254
00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:34.090
Everything was cool.
Everything was serious because I was having conversations.

255
00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:38.610
That was fucking,
you're having conversation with people who weren't there

256
00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:43.480
while watching Nascar.
I watched NASCAR sober.
Don't try that shit.

257
00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:45.780
He don't fuck around.
Nascar is a SYRAH NASCAR's.

258
00:14:45.781 --> 00:14:47.740
Is that a NASCAR cap you're wearing right now?

259
00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:52.190
What is it better not ask that question.
It's like number,
I feel

260
00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:56.270
<v 4>bad.
I don't know shit about any sports.
Dale Earnhardt.
Okay.
I heard he's dead.</v>

261
00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:59.240
Yes.
That guy's done.
Yes.
He his son still racist.

262
00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.000
You don't a lot of money in Nascar.
I just thought it was like,
sorry,

263
00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:04.030
it's a lot of money in that shit.

264
00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:06.890
You really didn't know that this was the alert for real.

265
00:15:06.891 --> 00:15:10.250
How the fuck am I supposed to know that a number is some particular man's
number?

266
00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:14.130
How would I know that as a very good question cause you were,
cause you,

267
00:15:14.131 --> 00:15:17.510
you have seen that and have numbers on there.
No,
I don't.
Literally,

268
00:15:17.511 --> 00:15:19.700
I don't even know the rules to basketball.
I don't know.

269
00:15:19.701 --> 00:15:23.170
When someone gets mad at someone I'm like what did someone do?
I'm like,

270
00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:25.700
wait a minute,
you're mad that he touched you.
You fucking pussy

271
00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:32.120
whack ass sport is this.
We follow,
follow fighting mostly.

272
00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:34.550
I mean like every other sport and at least I don't know about you,

273
00:15:34.551 --> 00:15:36.710
but I mean like to me it's like every of the sport it's just kind of like a

274
00:15:36.711 --> 00:15:40.040
delusion of,
you know,
like,
I don't know,
it's just like other sports.

275
00:15:40.041 --> 00:15:44.150
It's watered down fighting and like you've talked to a fight and again I'm

276
00:15:44.151 --> 00:15:44.984
interested,

277
00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:49.290
<v 7>do you like your face,
know how much you really trucking,</v>

278
00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:50.690
follow fight and like just,

279
00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:52.470
<v 4>yeah,
they pretty much know.</v>

280
00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:56.080
The thing about sports is that's what sports don't have.

281
00:15:56.290 --> 00:15:59.400
Wood fighting doesn't have the sports do have like team sports is the,
the,

282
00:15:59.401 --> 00:16:01.840
the joy of seeing all these people work together.

283
00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:06.310
There's something beautiful about a basketball game or one dude makes a call on

284
00:16:06.311 --> 00:16:11.140
the other dude fakes of pass run and passes it off and the other dude hits the

285
00:16:11.141 --> 00:16:14.530
three and everything falls in line.
Like they practiced it and you're like,

286
00:16:14.531 --> 00:16:15.910
look at that man,
look at that.

287
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.160
And everybody gets crazy and now high five each other.

288
00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:20.950
You don't get that in fighting.
It doesn't exist.
So there's,

289
00:16:20.951 --> 00:16:22.570
there's something about teamwork.

290
00:16:22.571 --> 00:16:27.040
There's something beautiful about watching a soccer team pull off some crazy

291
00:16:27.041 --> 00:16:28.520
past that they've rehearsed,
you know,

292
00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:31.630
many times and the guy shoots the goal and there's something about that when

293
00:16:31.631 --> 00:16:35.800
everybody gets together and hugs and cheers.
You don't quite ever get that in,

294
00:16:35.801 --> 00:16:39.220
in fighting and fighting.
It's very much me.
It's individually

295
00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:44.170
<v 7>petition of um,
like I think even in comedy,</v>

296
00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:48.910
certain certain Comedians that competitive nature drives him

297
00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:51.650
<v 4>more than others.
A lot of people,
Eliza slash in German,</v>

298
00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:55.220
like she was talking about how it's heard number one thing that she's so

299
00:16:55.221 --> 00:16:56.050
competitive then.

300
00:16:56.050 --> 00:16:57.780
<v 7>My God,
I have no problem with like God.</v>

301
00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:03.170
I think it makes for great comedy because you can be friends offstage,
but Doug,

302
00:17:03.171 --> 00:17:07.610
when it's you and that microphone is,
that gets your juices going like

303
00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:09.640
<v 4>so.
You get real competitive too.</v>

304
00:17:09.641 --> 00:17:12.250
You can put it on not other friends and not competitive

305
00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:13.430
<v 7>in a negative way.</v>

306
00:17:13.431 --> 00:17:17.060
Like I don't dog other people's comedy cause I'm not the comedy police.

307
00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:21.680
But what I do do is if you just killed and I'm not dying dog,

308
00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:23.960
that ain't happening because it's that competition.
Like,

309
00:17:23.961 --> 00:17:26.790
I'm not going to be the one that brings the show down.
You know what I mean?

310
00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:27.633
It's funny.

311
00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:31.750
<v 4>Yeah.
I think I used to think about it like that.
I used to feel like that.</v>

312
00:17:31.751 --> 00:17:32.441
He used to feel like,
well,

313
00:17:32.441 --> 00:17:34.330
I don't want everyone Obama to go up there and kick ass,

314
00:17:34.331 --> 00:17:36.910
but now I don't think about it like that at all.
Now I only,

315
00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:40.180
I only always think about like,
what's the best thing to think about?

316
00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:43.870
The best thing to think about regardless of the circumstance is the act is,

317
00:17:43.871 --> 00:17:46.660
what am I going to say?
What a w where's my head at?
What am I talking about?

318
00:17:46.661 --> 00:17:47.690
That's the best thing to think about it.

319
00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:50.490
As soon as you start thinking about peripheral shit,

320
00:17:50.491 --> 00:17:54.210
like they're like he killed and what have they liked him more than me?

321
00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:56.040
I want to make sure they don't

322
00:17:56.690 --> 00:17:59.150
<v 7>surly the competition that I'm thinking of,</v>

323
00:17:59.151 --> 00:18:01.910
but probably because of the fact that this,
you know,

324
00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:04.940
I'm just getting to the point where I'm starting to,

325
00:18:04.941 --> 00:18:09.560
even people started even thinking about me headlining.
Once you know that you,

326
00:18:09.561 --> 00:18:13.070
you are the show,
it doesn't matter no more.
You know what I'm saying?

327
00:18:13.071 --> 00:18:17.090
Like and just like you,
you,
you said,
I'm still scrapping out here.

328
00:18:17.091 --> 00:18:20.270
You know what I'm saying?
As far as getting to to the point where I'm headlining.

329
00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:24.800
So I got to kind of think that a little bit.
But once I know that I'm the show,

330
00:18:24.801 --> 00:18:28.190
it doesn't matter whether the opener closer monkey out of his ass.

331
00:18:28.191 --> 00:18:30.560
It really doesn't matter how long you been doing comedy.

332
00:18:30.561 --> 00:18:32.540
Now it'll be nine years this year.

333
00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:36.710
<v 6>Nine years.
What about you Brian?
I don't really count.
Three.
Three years.
Yeah,</v>

334
00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:40.720
three years.
I mean that was just pretty much,
that was a,
yeah,
it was march.
March.

335
00:18:41.050 --> 00:18:43.750
Oh wait,
sort of working at the NPR.
I was a,
I was a bouncer.

336
00:18:43.751 --> 00:18:46.210
I came into this total fucking accident.
I was,
I was fucking,

337
00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:49.450
I was a bouncer like right off skid row in downtown La,
like for two years.

338
00:18:49.451 --> 00:18:50.140
Like in those little,

339
00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:52.660
those bars they got out there to move the hipsters in and make it safe and

340
00:18:52.661 --> 00:18:56.020
everything and you know,
just make the area,
I'm not familiar with that.

341
00:18:56.021 --> 00:18:59.110
What do they to use this?
All right,
well basically they've been slowly,
slowly,

342
00:18:59.111 --> 00:19:02.860
slowly pushing skid row in downtown la a little bit for their light just towards

343
00:19:02.861 --> 00:19:03.660
the fucking river

344
00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:08.030
<v 4>for,
if you've never seen this by the way I,
we filmed fear factor down there.</v>

345
00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:11.720
We used to do downtown La shit all the time and I used to drive up skid row.

346
00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:12.720
It is a fear

347
00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:17.390
crazy for the folks that don't know.

348
00:19:17.391 --> 00:19:22.391
There's areas of downtown La that are like a fucking George Romero Zombie world

349
00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:24.170
that I see.
Especially at night.

350
00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:31.560
I'm talking block after block of just crazed out homeless people who are

351
00:19:32.871 --> 00:19:37.220
sleeping right there on the ground with shopping carts and you know,

352
00:19:37.221 --> 00:19:41.870
one shoe on and tattered and everyone's crackdown on illegal.

353
00:19:41.871 --> 00:19:42.740
After a while I'll go ahead.

354
00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:45.680
Well they made it illegal after a while for them to put the tents up during the

355
00:19:45.681 --> 00:19:48.800
day,
but they were always up at night her yet illegal.

356
00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:53.480
You have to take your tent down.
There's another fucking thunder dome.

357
00:19:53.481 --> 00:19:57.170
It's a whole goddamn thunder dome of just homeless or shooting politicians.

358
00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:00.920
We made along.
You've got to take those tents down during the day.

359
00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:02.510
I'm in subway and

360
00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:05.750
<v 6>I was just working out there as a bouncer for awhile and it got depressing after</v>

361
00:20:05.751 --> 00:20:08.270
a fucking bit.
So I was looking for a positive environment to go to,

362
00:20:08.271 --> 00:20:12.120
to offer my services.
So I went to,
it was actually a comic,
Steve Simone,

363
00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:14.520
he told me,
hey,
go try it.
The comedy club,
you know,

364
00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:18.940
you'll be a security guy there.
So at the Improv Improv,
um,
and uh,

365
00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:22.170
and then you started going on stage.
Yeah.
I mean cause that will really,
cause I,

366
00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:22.401
yeah,

367
00:20:22.401 --> 00:20:25.250
I just got a little bit pissed because I was stuck in the showroom Washington at

368
00:20:25.251 --> 00:20:27.090
first I was so stoked because I was working around you.

369
00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:28.910
All of this does laughter and everything like that.

370
00:20:28.911 --> 00:20:31.430
And then I go into the showroom and I had to be making sure that everybody was

371
00:20:31.431 --> 00:20:32.510
behaving during a show.

372
00:20:32.511 --> 00:20:36.920
And so many of these comics just so just such a much a heartless hokey crap.

373
00:20:36.921 --> 00:20:39.860
And you can tell they're just looking to,
they're not up there for the audience.

374
00:20:39.861 --> 00:20:41.870
They're not out there to make people laugh it up there to get their fucking

375
00:20:41.871 --> 00:20:43.910
little,
you know,
sit tree are going and all that.

376
00:20:43.911 --> 00:20:46.670
And I got pissed and it was anger that drove me towards this stage.

377
00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:48.040
So you went up

378
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:50.290
<v 4>because of bad comedy.
Yeah.
That's interesting.</v>

379
00:20:50.291 --> 00:20:54.000
Made me and that I had to met me down.

380
00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:58.570
You're hilarious and you've calmed the fuck down.
Do you know how wired you are?

381
00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:02.010
Fucking weird.
Most people want to fucking fucking wipe my fucking money.

382
00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:03.820
Fuck you man.
You can have my fucking money.

383
00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:06.670
You know I sold these fucking comics neural heartless and Darryl knows I've

384
00:21:06.671 --> 00:21:10.040
calmed down.
Darryl knows you've calmed down.
And Darryl also knows that.

385
00:21:10.041 --> 00:21:14.630
Everybody knows he's smart.
This is a strange group,
you guys,
a little duo act.

386
00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:20.800
We need to get a new fairly brothers script or on Youtube fucks

387
00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:26.700
<v 7>do some comedy shows like three times a year down there.</v>

388
00:21:26.701 --> 00:21:28.790
It's a big ass homeless shelter down there and I,

389
00:21:28.791 --> 00:21:32.250
and I'll do comedy shows there like three times a year.
Really?
I will tell you,

390
00:21:32.251 --> 00:21:34.830
man,
it's fucking,
it's a zoo man.

391
00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:37.460
<v 4>It is a zoo.
It's a human zoo.</v>

392
00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:40.560
<v 7>Doing comedy in there is fun as shit.</v>

393
00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:43.130
<v 4>Yeah.
Because really</v>

394
00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:46.101
no.
What else?

395
00:21:46.101 --> 00:21:50.810
People who have made giant mistakes almost every step of the way.

396
00:21:50.811 --> 00:21:54.880
It's been a mistake.
Well,
yeah,
that's,
that's,
that's a lot of human beings,

397
00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:57.400
man has a point where they don't consider themselves human anymore.
They don't,

398
00:21:57.710 --> 00:22:01.750
they're not at the end of the day to show him away for a living for a long time.

399
00:22:01.790 --> 00:22:04.220
Just like shit being human is just like a,

400
00:22:04.221 --> 00:22:07.160
some program that you run over the animal system that,

401
00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:12.080
that runs the body and now being human,
it's just soup that's so fucking fragile.

402
00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:16.080
<v 7>So when do you think that the huge,
the humanity leads</v>

403
00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:19.440
<v 4>soon as shit gets ugly on,
as soon as the power goes out,</v>

404
00:22:19.441 --> 00:22:21.570
as soon as there's no food,
as soon as your baby's crying,

405
00:22:21.571 --> 00:22:25.350
as soon as this guy's got it,
you don't.
And as soon as soon as shit gets ugly,

406
00:22:25.351 --> 00:22:28.710
and I look at New Orleans,
man,
no one ones.
We saw how ugly that caught.

407
00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:32.520
There was some so many murders in New Orleans during the,
after Katrina.

408
00:22:32.610 --> 00:22:35.480
They didn't even,
they can't even get it.
I don't even know what to do.

409
00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:38.780
Niggas was murdering people in,
in New Orleans when the lights was on,

410
00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:41.560
but it got worse.
It got way,
way,
way,
way,
way worse.

411
00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:45.600
Got Worse with the cops to the cops went all Zombie vigilantism there were cops

412
00:22:45.601 --> 00:22:48.060
were driving around in pickup trucks,
picking people off of guns.

413
00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:50.280
There's a lot of crazy shit went down in New Orleans,
man.

414
00:22:50.281 --> 00:22:53.640
A lot of people were killed.
No.
You know,
and that's just,
look,
yeah,

415
00:22:53.641 --> 00:22:55.740
New Orleans is bad as it is,
but so's La man.

416
00:22:55.741 --> 00:22:58.200
Look what happened when Rodney King with the Rodney King Verdict.
You know,

417
00:22:58.201 --> 00:23:00.870
people forget about how crazy it got down here.

418
00:23:01.910 --> 00:23:03.750
The place I'm in the country,

419
00:23:03.751 --> 00:23:05.790
they have different rights in different cities and all that.
Hold on.

420
00:23:05.791 --> 00:23:10.280
You guys can't talk at the same time.
I'm not going to run my hands.
Be Smart.

421
00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:13.590
<v 7>The whole theory.
Oh thank you.
This is the whole theory with that though.</v>

422
00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:18.720
That shit went crazy until it got to about Beverly and then that's when they

423
00:23:18.721 --> 00:23:21.450
were like,
y'all niggas gotta go back to where y'all came from.
Y'All can,

424
00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:22.680
y'all can burn that.
True.

425
00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:25.710
Y'All can burn down Inglewood and you can burn down Compton.

426
00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:30.990
But once it got to like Beverly ish,
that's when the national guard was like,

427
00:23:30.991 --> 00:23:32.070
y'all ain't coming up here.

428
00:23:32.150 --> 00:23:35.270
<v 4>Is that what happened during the La Riots?
I was living here.</v>

429
00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:39.590
I was living in Palos Verdes is at a time I was 13 years old.

430
00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:43.040
And I can say that just paddles verdict pieces out by a,

431
00:23:43.041 --> 00:23:46.160
it's basically like South Bay area.
It's the where.
Um,

432
00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:50.480
so where is it in relationship to a of ghetto?
I mean like basically it's,
yeah,

433
00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:55.400
technically it's technically it's about 10 minutes away from 10 minutes away.

434
00:23:55.401 --> 00:23:57.590
So your,
your clothes so you gotta be nervous.

435
00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:01.130
I mean like really this is a freeway so it's not like they're gonna March down

436
00:24:01.131 --> 00:24:04.140
the freeway straight.
Exactly.
This scary people.

437
00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:12.770
It's ugly.
I think it could be kind of like a,
a physical barrier.

438
00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:16.160
This more than just cops.
When it comes to these,
I mean la is kind of like this,

439
00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:20.780
it's like this big circle and on the inside of the circle is like this is the

440
00:24:20.781 --> 00:24:21.830
pit of Shit and all that.

441
00:24:21.831 --> 00:24:24.350
And on the outside like you're kind of safe like the beach and then the hills

442
00:24:24.351 --> 00:24:26.840
and everything like that.
And it's like this physical barrier

443
00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:32.450
for level one to level two and three situations.

444
00:24:32.451 --> 00:24:35.320
Everything's off limits.
There's chaos in the streets.

445
00:24:35.321 --> 00:24:38.610
The cops have been in their positions,
but we were talking about this,
Robert,

446
00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:40.790
is this stop where like when you come to a hill like this,

447
00:24:40.791 --> 00:24:43.670
you start because you're thinking,
if I get caught up here,
I'm fucking,

448
00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:45.650
I'm not getting out of it.
But listen to what I'm saying.

449
00:24:45.651 --> 00:24:48.560
This is only level one stuff you're talking about.
No chaos.

450
00:24:48.561 --> 00:24:51.830
You talking about no loss of civility you're talking about it's basically

451
00:24:51.831 --> 00:24:54.650
society is running and it's just a few fuck ups that are going crazy.

452
00:24:55.290 --> 00:24:58.130
Well when the shit hits the fan,
if the shit ever hits the fan,

453
00:24:58.250 --> 00:25:00.800
probably not going to be like that.
It's not going to be lecture.

454
00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:02.870
There's not going to be civility.
No,
of

455
00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:06.050
<v 5>course not.
I mean cause like just being in jail like</v>

456
00:25:07.790 --> 00:25:10.060
it's a whole nother world and it's like a,

457
00:25:10.090 --> 00:25:14.810
I think a lot of times that I'm still kind of institutionalized with like just

458
00:25:14.811 --> 00:25:15.351
little shit.

459
00:25:15.351 --> 00:25:19.550
Like I can't sleep in my house without a door or like a window open like patio

460
00:25:19.551 --> 00:25:22.790
door.
Why?
I don't know.
It's just something that,
you know,

461
00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:25.370
somebody can sneak in your house in the middle of the night if they want it to

462
00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:28.390
tell people you don't want people to come in and kiss you.
Come on,

463
00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:32.150
guess what you're asking.
Any Lehman would come on in,
you can leave.

464
00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:36.740
I mean come in,
but you ain't leaving.
You're scared of kisses.
Oh fuck that.
Well,

465
00:25:36.741 --> 00:25:40.700
yours is this a freedom thing?
Yeah.
It's like,
it's like,

466
00:25:41.130 --> 00:25:45.590
it's like being able to know even subconsciously then I'm not trapped.
Yeah.

467
00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:50.460
Wow.
Yeah.
How many years were you in jail for?
Two to dam and it's like,
um,

468
00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:51.770
even with what you were saying,

469
00:25:51.771 --> 00:25:56.150
like I hate when people use the term subtle to anything.
It's like,

470
00:25:56.510 --> 00:26:00.970
it's just terminology nowadays.
It's just pissing me off because it's like dark.

471
00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:06.110
I'm a firm believer that it ain't no such thing as racism.
No more.

472
00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:11.810
Are you talking about I'm raising
those Nascar motherfuckers.
Got You.

473
00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:13.730
Brainwashed.
It's true.
Racism,

474
00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:20.330
sexism and racism and black people.
Heat light,
Brown people.

475
00:26:21.270 --> 00:26:22.570
It's not that.

476
00:26:22.571 --> 00:26:26.300
It's like that is some shit that people make up so that they can make money off

477
00:26:26.301 --> 00:26:28.820
of that shit.
Oh my God.
Jesse Jackson has a,

478
00:26:28.821 --> 00:26:33.410
W Jesse Jackson has a w two man.
No,
I'm,
I'm not trying to need,

479
00:26:33.411 --> 00:26:36.230
we need to pause this thing that you both bought.
You need to get high

480
00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:41.810
because,
listen,
Joe,
Joe,
listen to this though.
Listen to my theory.

481
00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:44.130
My theory is this.

482
00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:48.330
<v 7>When you give yourself an excuse to fail,</v>

483
00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:51.810
then you have that excuse.
Whereas there was a,

484
00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:56.820
there was a time that my race could stop me from accomplishing certain things.

485
00:26:57.300 --> 00:27:02.190
Those days are over with now,
so as far as the racism as we think it is,

486
00:27:02.191 --> 00:27:03.600
I don't think it's that anymore.

487
00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:06.630
My race can't stop me from doing anything that I wanted to.

488
00:27:06.670 --> 00:27:09.360
<v 1>Dude's certainly less intense,
but it doesn't.</v>

489
00:27:09.361 --> 00:27:12.900
Just because it can't stop you from accomplishing your goals doesn't mean it's

490
00:27:12.901 --> 00:27:16.380
not there.
No matter what you do,
it is human nature.

491
00:27:16.381 --> 00:27:20.130
It is a genetic imperative that we judge.

492
00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:23.690
We look at genetics,
we look at the shape of a woman's body.
Your,

493
00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:27.030
your body tells you this is sexually attractive because this is a woman's going

494
00:27:27.031 --> 00:27:30.600
to have good babies.
It's,
it's the,
our entire society is set up.

495
00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:34.140
You look at people that are bigger than you.
You become intimidated.
It's natural.

496
00:27:34.141 --> 00:27:36.390
That person can dominate you physically.
All this shit is in place.

497
00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:38.990
You look at people that aren't you,
they're black and I'm white.

498
00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.060
Maybe they'll side with themselves and maybe they're on their own team and I

499
00:27:42.061 --> 00:27:43.950
should be afraid of them because this is a different team.

500
00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:48.120
It's almost completely natural now as an intelligent person,

501
00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:51.330
you're supposed to be able to recognize this is just a human being that was born

502
00:27:51.331 --> 00:27:54.180
Chinese and this is a human being that was born African and this,

503
00:27:54.190 --> 00:27:56.320
and then it's all just some crazy lottery.

504
00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:59.100
We were all in this together and you should judge people in their actions.

505
00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:02.460
That is,
that's,
that's the intelligent evolved approach,

506
00:28:02.490 --> 00:28:05.700
but how many fucking people are intelligent and evolved?

507
00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:07.920
It is natural that racism is going to exist.

508
00:28:07.921 --> 00:28:09.990
It's going exist just like being stupid.

509
00:28:10.910 --> 00:28:14.590
<v 7>It's,
it is.
It is when it's a human instinct.
Well,</v>

510
00:28:14.591 --> 00:28:18.470
well I think right now if I want it to,
you could be,
if I want it to,

511
00:28:18.471 --> 00:28:22.490
if I'm not going to exist in this room,
that it could exist,

512
00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:28.540
but to me it's still insanity.

513
00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:29.690
<v 1>Well,
you're saying,</v>

514
00:28:29.691 --> 00:28:32.900
you're saying two totally different things and on one hand I totally agree with

515
00:28:32.901 --> 00:28:36.170
you that you can accomplish anything you want to do on an oftentimes you put

516
00:28:36.171 --> 00:28:38.930
limitations on yourself saying,
you know,
hey,
as a black man,

517
00:28:38.931 --> 00:28:42.140
I'm never going to pass this.
Hey,
as a guy who was born up here,

518
00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:44.900
I'm never going to be on television.
I'm never going to do that.

519
00:28:44.901 --> 00:28:47.240
You can impose those limitations on you right there.

520
00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:49.100
Those are self fulfilling prophecies,
man.

521
00:28:49.101 --> 00:28:52.340
You can really decide your life is going to be a shitty life.

522
00:28:52.910 --> 00:28:54.470
You're absolutely correct about that.

523
00:28:54.471 --> 00:28:57.880
No one can stop you from doing what you want to do,
but they will try.

524
00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:02.470
Don't think they will say things.
Don't think racism is there.
No,

525
00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:07.130
it's not fair.
But you can't say racism isn't real it.
Fuck yeah,
it's real.

526
00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:10.610
But it doesn't mean that it has to stop you and it doesn't mean we have to

527
00:29:10.611 --> 00:29:14.540
tolerate it,
but it means it slowly.
We're moving away from the animal,

528
00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:17.570
but how long have we been a human?

529
00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:21.410
I mean when you go back at what point in time is it stopped being a human,

530
00:29:21.411 --> 00:29:24.380
is it Australia pithy kiss and went,
what the fuck?
Which,
which,

531
00:29:24.381 --> 00:29:27.410
which monkey is it where you say that's not a human anymore.

532
00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:31.070
So everything from that is trying to get away from being an animal.

533
00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:33.620
The animal is still here though.

534
00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:36.560
It takes some time to get all that shit out of your system.

535
00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:39.120
<v 7>Well,
you also have to,
you also have to be,
I think,</v>

536
00:29:39.121 --> 00:29:43.720
forward thinking in type of concept because you know what,
for instance,

537
00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:48.700
I'll give you a great example of this.
You know what I'm saying?
Um,
just the fact,

538
00:29:48.701 --> 00:29:51.850
and this is gonna sound weird,
just the fact that I'm on this podcast,

539
00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:54.050
for instance,
it's,

540
00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:59.110
it's plenty of of comics that I respect and I love,

541
00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:04.300
but they would not let me into their home.
So what does that,

542
00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:07.120
you know what I'm saying?
Is that racism or is that just

543
00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:10.640
<v 5>you say that though.
Every time we've hung out you're like,
man,</v>

544
00:30:10.641 --> 00:30:12.760
I'm so happy hanging out with me and look at the fuck you talking about.

545
00:30:12.770 --> 00:30:13.790
We're all hanging out together.

546
00:30:13.810 --> 00:30:16.970
But you said that to me when I've gotten you on stage before you said you know

547
00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.510
this guy,
but I don't stress we get,
we all go on stage.

548
00:30:20.511 --> 00:30:23.180
But I don't keep putting that shit on yourself.
No,

549
00:30:23.181 --> 00:30:28.040
but you don't understand the stages that I normally get up do though.

550
00:30:28.041 --> 00:30:30.560
Cause I seen you at the Improv and you get at the Improv Bro.
It ain't,

551
00:30:30.561 --> 00:30:33.560
it's not like you only get these shitty places,
but

552
00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:39.070
<v 7>saying that to say this is not a matter of what race I am as far as that's</v>

553
00:30:40.691 --> 00:30:43.150
concerned.
It's just the comfort level.
You know what I'm saying?

554
00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:48.040
And where were you were saying that people see stuff a certain way?

555
00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:51.820
I think that I programmed myself to put race

556
00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:56.550
<v 5>CISM out of the picture and just handle myself a certain way.
I can't,</v>

557
00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:58.420
I don't understand that with your mind.
Right.

558
00:30:58.430 --> 00:31:00.670
Understanding that you are doing that.
So,
so,

559
00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:03.940
so maybe me making that blanket statement was a little bit too much,

560
00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:05.440
but in my mind,

561
00:31:05.470 --> 00:31:10.470
I can't see racism as an option for me to blame something or something exterior

562
00:31:10.931 --> 00:31:12.520
for me not doing what I got you.

563
00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:16.060
We can have an awesome TV show where take you and put you in a fucking bow tie

564
00:31:16.061 --> 00:31:18.880
and burn your around white neighborhoods in the south and you will see some

565
00:31:18.881 --> 00:31:23.260
fucking racism like you wouldn't believe.
Add to what you're saying.
I mean,

566
00:31:23.290 --> 00:31:25.720
I've like been to the south man.
I know you have it.

567
00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:28.960
I love the south because my hope is what I'm saying.

568
00:31:28.961 --> 00:31:31.980
You by yourself with a clipboard going through white neighborhoods.
Smile there.

569
00:31:32.030 --> 00:31:32.940
Now see now

570
00:31:33.670 --> 00:31:37.160
<v 6>every time someone calls you a nigger need more paper</v>

571
00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:44.570
paper.
Well you need a fucking phone book.

572
00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:49.840
That's what
we're not,
I wouldn't say racism either.

573
00:31:49.850 --> 00:31:52.510
I think that's always a bold statement.
He's Megan.
But I mean like honestly,

574
00:31:52.511 --> 00:31:56.380
like we're at a point now where it's like,
all right,
when,
when when people,

575
00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:59.470
wingers for instance,
okay wiggers people say

576
00:32:01.650 --> 00:32:03.890
they wish they were black,
they were sealed bad.
Saying wigger

577
00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:08.860
I feel when I say we're going to somebody,
I feel like I kinda sorta said,
nigger,

578
00:32:10.290 --> 00:32:14.950
mother fucking trigger fingers.
Don't want to be black.
You got to remember,

579
00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:18.880
I'm trying to tell him and I'm like,
we're just trying to be black people.

580
00:32:18.881 --> 00:32:21.280
Like this is like an old taking this way too seriously.

581
00:32:22.030 --> 00:32:23.590
This is what the fuck are you laughing with us?

582
00:32:23.591 --> 00:32:26.940
He's got his wigger point that he wants to get through your point.

583
00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:31.720
More powerful.
And I say fucking wigger too.
All right.

584
00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:34.450
They don't want to be black.
They're winners.
All right.
They're not,

585
00:32:34.451 --> 00:32:36.400
we're not talking about they want to be when African Americans,

586
00:32:36.401 --> 00:32:37.740
they want to be there.
Wiggers you know,
I mean like,

587
00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:39.740
they're not looking to take Obama's place one day

588
00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:42.020
<v 8>trying to be these thug ass retards,</v>

589
00:32:42.050 --> 00:32:45.140
like the lowest of what the black race could possibly have to offer.

590
00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:48.320
And I mean like basically this is just something that is,
again,

591
00:32:48.321 --> 00:32:51.250
generalize in the old school thought.
Whereas nowadays

592
00:32:51.330 --> 00:32:55.550
<v 2>you can say any blocking and talking about some nonsense.</v>

593
00:32:55.650 --> 00:32:58.100
Tro In jazz,
right.

594
00:33:00.610 --> 00:33:05.610
Fucking make his point so I can get hired firing up.

595
00:33:07.390 --> 00:33:11.250
You're talking nonsense.
So I know it's like,
go ahead cause I'm getting,
listen,

596
00:33:11.251 --> 00:33:11.740
it's very,

597
00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:15.060
it's important to get called on nonsense talk cause you can go your whole life

598
00:33:15.061 --> 00:33:16.820
talking nonsense and get away with

599
00:33:16.990 --> 00:33:17.411
<v 8>fed shit.</v>

600
00:33:17.411 --> 00:33:22.300
I'm starting to have heart palpitations right now about the show from what?

601
00:33:22.301 --> 00:33:26.800
From being so high right now.
Coffee,
coffee.

602
00:33:27.310 --> 00:33:28.900
But I could always get hired.
Joe,

603
00:33:28.901 --> 00:33:31.780
I had the most crazy thing happened to me last night.

604
00:33:31.781 --> 00:33:36.781
I found out about a whole new sex fetish that I had no idea existed.

605
00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:40.690
And it's the most disturbing fucking thing in the rug.

606
00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:45.720
It's for kids when you're a kid and your mom yells at you and you liked it,

607
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.730
you know like you know when your mom used to yell at you,
you hated it.

608
00:33:48.731 --> 00:33:51.760
But there's people out there that when you're,
their mom yelled at them,

609
00:33:51.850 --> 00:33:53.500
they loved it.
And so when they grew up,

610
00:33:53.710 --> 00:33:56.890
they like these things called gigantic women.
And so,

611
00:33:57.090 --> 00:33:59.270
you know like the old saifai videos of like,
you know,

612
00:33:59.290 --> 00:34:03.460
the attack of the art crumb type women or giant,

613
00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:05.590
the attack of the 50 foot women and stuff like that.

614
00:34:05.770 --> 00:34:10.570
So there's now fetish websites where it's like little GI Joe characters and like

615
00:34:10.571 --> 00:34:14.990
naked girls.
And it's fucking so creepy though.

616
00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.430
The lifestyle that,
that there is a,
there's also this,

617
00:34:18.431 --> 00:34:21.010
there's the fetishes women with dolls,

618
00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:24.850
women with small dolls that they kind of 10 that it's a person.
Yeah.

619
00:34:24.851 --> 00:34:27.730
And like they're bad.
They're like,
they like command them to do things.

620
00:34:27.731 --> 00:34:31.210
They lock them up in cages when they have full on movies.
Wait a minute,

621
00:34:31.211 --> 00:34:33.860
the women command the dolls to do things or they're,
they're,

622
00:34:33.910 --> 00:34:37.000
they're yelling at the dolls,
like,
you know,
kind of like as a mom,

623
00:34:37.140 --> 00:34:40.180
like I was talking to one of the girls that was in one of these movies and

624
00:34:40.181 --> 00:34:41.860
they're like,
yeah,
it's really weird because like,

625
00:34:41.861 --> 00:34:44.890
you're yelling at these dolls and then like one would knock over and then you'd

626
00:34:44.891 --> 00:34:47.770
have to kind of set it back up while you're in scene and stuff like that.

627
00:34:48.070 --> 00:34:51.550
So I went to this website,
and this is a beautiful website.
The,

628
00:34:51.690 --> 00:34:54.160
at first I was shocked,
but now I think I love this shit.

629
00:34:54.161 --> 00:34:58.700
And I think it's the coolest shit ever.
It's called giantess.net g,
I,

630
00:34:58.701 --> 00:35:02.230
N T,
e s energy I a n t,

631
00:35:02.231 --> 00:35:07.231
I a n t e s s.net and they have forums,

632
00:35:07.631 --> 00:35:09.730
they have chat rooms and they have everything like that.

633
00:35:09.731 --> 00:35:14.500
But the crazy thing is that they sell clips like,
like girls,

634
00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:20.530
girls small.
Look at this shit.
Look at this

635
00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:27.130
calls with little penises that they're like sucking on the doors and then

636
00:35:27.131 --> 00:35:29.330
there's like parts where like they're putting dolls in ohm.

637
00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:33.290
<v 2>I think they'll feel yelling at the dogs when they put them in each other.
Yeah.</v>

638
00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:36.010
<v 8>Why is it dolls?
I don't get it.</v>

639
00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:41.360
It's because it's the little man big Gi doll.
Yeah.

640
00:35:41.370 --> 00:35:44.480
Maybe pretend that that's damn or something people.
Yeah.
People sit there.

641
00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:48.990
It's a little green Dominic dolls and even look,
humans are stupid looking thing.

642
00:35:48.991 --> 00:35:52.530
It's got a big flat bottom where it has to stand up.
You know,
like it's surfing.

643
00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:55.360
That always bugged me out about those dolls.
Like you pee,

644
00:35:55.370 --> 00:35:57.810
you can't even make a doll.
Army men,
right.

645
00:35:57.811 --> 00:36:00.450
Candidate can't even make one that stands on its own.

646
00:36:00.451 --> 00:36:03.600
You have to have a surfboard under it everywhere.
It can't even pretend.

647
00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:06.120
My favorite shits,
the Emily Parker ones.

648
00:36:06.121 --> 00:36:08.440
If you look at search that website for the Emily Parker,

649
00:36:08.441 --> 00:36:13.140
it's also on size fetish zone.com and you'll just become addicted to this shit.

650
00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:16.370
Well,
I'm looking at the forums right now,
man.
Look at this.

651
00:36:16.590 --> 00:36:20.820
I'm afraid scientists and small men.
Oh my God,
this forum is stuffed.
Yeah.

652
00:36:20.821 --> 00:36:22.320
And it's so strange.

653
00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:26.340
It's all these girls and they're sucking these dicks of these little tiny men

654
00:36:26.530 --> 00:36:30.780
have like little Dixie they put on them.
This is so strange is awesome.

655
00:36:31.590 --> 00:36:33.090
It's super popular.

656
00:36:33.091 --> 00:36:35.780
And it's weird like when you see the Scifi movies with the TAC,

657
00:36:35.850 --> 00:36:39.720
the 50 foot woman,
most guys just go,
wow,
that's kinda cool.
A big woman.

658
00:36:39.810 --> 00:36:44.100
But there's people addicted to that shit.
Like that's what gets him off.
Wow.

659
00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:49.080
So I spent
a lot of people would a lot of time on their fucking,

660
00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:51.540
she's at a time thing,
man.
Or it's a

661
00:36:53.310 --> 00:36:57.240
developing a human being from child to adult is very,

662
00:36:57.241 --> 00:37:01.020
very complicated and all sorts of things are set up in place,
you know,

663
00:37:01.021 --> 00:37:03.840
to make sure that you become a successful person or to encourage you.

664
00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:08.160
And when those things get hijacked and weird shit happens,
like abuse,
you know,

665
00:37:08.161 --> 00:37:11.580
weird little little fucking fetish is developing the mind.

666
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.190
This check this that says this,
this is a trailer.

667
00:37:14.191 --> 00:37:18.120
If you go on youtube and type in giant his trailer 2009 this is kind of giving

668
00:37:18.121 --> 00:37:20.700
you a sample where it shows a really,

669
00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:25.760
oh my God woman and little people love and it's,

670
00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:29.220
it's,
and she's standing around in the middle of the street.
Oh my God,

671
00:37:29.221 --> 00:37:32.220
you crushed it
and look at this.

672
00:37:32.221 --> 00:37:35.100
It's just giant women and small men.

673
00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:38.190
Well there's small women in their underwear.

674
00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:41.820
Women are stomping on them and there's swallowing them and stuffing them in

675
00:37:41.821 --> 00:37:44.810
their pussies.
And this only came from their mom's yelling at him.

676
00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:47.920
That's what supposedly like the people that are into this thing.

677
00:37:47.921 --> 00:37:52.170
It's has a mom in small,
these ones are,
yeah,
that's a big bitch.

678
00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:55.650
Just goes to show.
It's how you're built,
man.
You can put any kid through anybody.

679
00:37:55.651 --> 00:38:00.330
I guess it's just how you're built.
That is insane.
That's amazing.
That's insane.

680
00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:04.920
And I'm addicted to it now and now have that fetish and it's not for a boner.

681
00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:07.900
Totally.
See where that's going.
I could totally see where that's going.

682
00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:11.610
That's trench.
Yeah.
I,
I've always thought about that because you know,

683
00:38:11.611 --> 00:38:14.850
like the Indian in the cupboard,
I was always thinking like,
wow,
you know,

684
00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:20.490
this is a book for kids about a naked half dressed man that it's put in.

685
00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:24.720
He kept them in his pocket and his name is like big bear or something like that.

686
00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:27.140
And there was something weird and sexual about that yet.

687
00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:31.020
Naked Indian guy and your kid,
if your kid,
if your kid came up to you,

688
00:38:31.350 --> 00:38:34.050
they get Indian man in your pocket,
you'd be fucking pissed.

689
00:38:34.051 --> 00:38:35.980
Was he a naked one or he one of those Indians

690
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:37.900
<v 2>would all the feathers and shit.
Yeah.
Well,
no,
he had,</v>

691
00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:41.080
I think he just had like that little loin cloth on little loin cloth with a

692
00:38:41.090 --> 00:38:43.180
little feather fall hanging out on one side.

693
00:38:43.181 --> 00:38:46.330
Weird little naked man hiding in your fucking plates.
And the kid was like,

694
00:38:46.331 --> 00:38:48.610
never tell your parents about our secret con.

695
00:38:48.611 --> 00:38:52.690
That's like it's a fucking Indian in the cupboard,
man.

696
00:38:52.691 --> 00:38:55.780
They don't make then they make the sex stories like that.

697
00:38:56.570 --> 00:39:00.190
That was there a movie.
But in these,
who was in that movie?

698
00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:06.430
Somebody romantic
fuck a little girl down.

699
00:39:07.530 --> 00:39:09.640
Who was in it?
The guy from the,

700
00:39:11.410 --> 00:39:12.620
Oh my God.

701
00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:20.500
What's the movie with,
no,
the guy from the,

702
00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:25.060
from the movie where they keep going to weddings and fucking bitches.
Oh,

703
00:39:25.061 --> 00:39:26.830
wedding crashers.
Yeah.
The wedding crashers.

704
00:39:26.890 --> 00:39:29.260
The one guy from the wedding crashers went in it cause he,

705
00:39:29.261 --> 00:39:34.261
cause he played a cowboy from 1995 and then they played a cowboy in that house.

706
00:39:34.410 --> 00:39:39.340
Scardino Lightfoot and Lindsay crouse are listed as the actors.

707
00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:42.900
Oh no,
he was in,
no,
he was in the Smithsonian movie now

708
00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:48.100
telling you we had to have a new rule no more.

709
00:39:48.101 --> 00:39:51.580
So people when they'd come over here and they don't smoke weed,
okay,
look,
here's,

710
00:39:51.581 --> 00:39:55.930
here's what the deal was.
Let's be,
let's be perfectly,
but I am a drinker.

711
00:39:55.931 --> 00:39:58.660
So you were about to say perfectly blunt,
but you don't even say that word.

712
00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:01.750
Now don't even say I am a,
I am a drinker,

713
00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:04.260
but I wasn't going to come to Joe's house.
Fucked up.
Listen,

714
00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:07.540
you bitches need to get on some comedy steroids.
That's what's going on.

715
00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:11.860
I need to get on this.
We'd stop playing around playing games.

716
00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:14.920
You're playing games in the future.
You're risking,

717
00:40:14.921 --> 00:40:17.190
you're risking a future talking nonsense.
Ooh,

718
00:40:17.530 --> 00:40:22.340
I'm not talking about you can save you from this can save you from an about

719
00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:26.380
pedophilia,
shit and all that.
I'm still tripping out who?

720
00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:30.040
Who the fuck pedophilia is important.
That is whatever that is.

721
00:40:30.041 --> 00:40:31.120
We need to find out about that.

722
00:40:31.121 --> 00:40:33.510
We need to invest in the fucking ass time for that Shit,
man.

723
00:40:33.511 --> 00:40:36.850
I know it's not a time thing,
man.
It's like that's what they liked best.

724
00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:39.550
If they had all the time in the world,
they would do that.

725
00:40:39.551 --> 00:40:40.980
If they had an hour a day not to do that.

726
00:40:41.170 --> 00:40:45.840
How do you find out that you like that shit?
That's a good question.
No,
it's no,

727
00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:47.370
it's more than your mom yells at you,

728
00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:51.460
got your mom spanked you and then she felt bad about it so she jerked you off.

729
00:40:52.410 --> 00:40:53.230
You know what I'm saying?

730
00:40:53.230 --> 00:40:56.040
It's like something like that has to happen early on that man.

731
00:40:56.041 --> 00:41:01.041
That's some shit where as though you have to discover that you like that shit

732
00:41:01.211 --> 00:41:02.800
man.
You have to discover that.

733
00:41:02.801 --> 00:41:06.070
And then the crazy thing about the internet is if you like something you'll just

734
00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:08.770
gotta be a website out there where there's a gang of other people that love it

735
00:41:08.771 --> 00:41:13.400
too.
You know it's not like the old days scary zoo.

736
00:41:14.590 --> 00:41:16.950
Oh my God.
It's crazy.
Yeah.

737
00:41:17.050 --> 00:41:19.270
Cause I mean they were talking about how like they thought they were alone and

738
00:41:19.271 --> 00:41:21.970
then the internet came out and then there are other people who fuck horses too

739
00:41:21.971 --> 00:41:24.850
and it's okay.
I can be part of a club now.
I mean it just,

740
00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:29.140
it was one of the weirdest documentaries ever.
It's weird how they did it too.

741
00:41:29.141 --> 00:41:32.830
Cause it was like a reenactment.
They didn't really have footage so they had a,

742
00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:37.880
but they were just cutting away real quick.
The editing with a fucking note.

743
00:41:38.430 --> 00:41:41.030
They had like the actual video of the dude getting fucked to death by the horse

744
00:41:41.031 --> 00:41:43.400
and then like the hardy were fucking disturbing.

745
00:41:43.401 --> 00:41:47.330
I mean sure you can imagine that much but I mean I admitted I got rock hard

746
00:41:47.331 --> 00:41:49.790
though.
Did you get hard?
What part?

747
00:41:49.850 --> 00:41:54.110
What part got your hard during the fucking other horse.
All right,
go to Chi died.

748
00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:56.690
Hit that shit kid.
Stuff playing around.

749
00:41:57.770 --> 00:41:59.870
Some mother fuckers want to come down and stay sober.

750
00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:03.290
Going small kind of shit is this,
get some of that Daryl,
stop.

751
00:42:03.590 --> 00:42:06.530
Darryl stops playing around your round.
Everyone needs fucking around down.

752
00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:09.980
Darrell just have a little,
it's better for you.
I'm telling you,

753
00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:13.370
you'll see the world in a better light.
Good light.

754
00:42:14.170 --> 00:42:16.510
Don't be scared of weed bro.
It's on sale.

755
00:42:17.210 --> 00:42:20.060
I took a little pussy like Nick Diaz says,
don't be scared homie.

756
00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:23.480
The reason I quit the wheat him and really it's not.
It's not because,
you know,

757
00:42:23.481 --> 00:42:26.150
it's a fear thing and thing like that.
And I just,
the last time I think it was,

758
00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:29.170
<v 6>it was my old boxing trainer and he was leaving the gym and I was like,
oh,
okay.</v>

759
00:42:29.171 --> 00:42:30.280
And you know,
he wanted to smoke.
So I was like,

760
00:42:30.290 --> 00:42:31.840
it's like a little bonding session that we have.

761
00:42:31.841 --> 00:42:34.810
And so we smoked out and then after we were done smoking out,
I mean,

762
00:42:34.811 --> 00:42:37.330
he's a stoner and I forget,
he's totally used to it.
So he's just like,
all right,

763
00:42:37.331 --> 00:42:40.420
get out of my truck.
And I'm like,
you can leave me alone.
I'm just high as shit.

764
00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:41.321
I ended up going home,

765
00:42:41.321 --> 00:42:44.800
eating all my food and I watched America's got talent for an hour and a half and

766
00:42:44.801 --> 00:42:47.530
then I woke up going,
that was the most useless fucking night of my life.
I mean,

767
00:42:47.531 --> 00:42:48.364
I just,

768
00:42:50.810 --> 00:42:52.930
<v 4>I'm still testing,
sorry.
And American Eagle apartments,</v>

769
00:42:52.931 --> 00:42:56.570
like I should have gone and tried to do something that,
that ruined you.

770
00:42:56.571 --> 00:43:00.080
This one time was smoking weed and I'd stopped years before,

771
00:43:00.081 --> 00:43:02.060
but then I went back and I was like,
well,
that was dumb.

772
00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:04.160
It was just like for real,
it's not for everybody,

773
00:43:04.250 --> 00:43:06.440
but a lot of people they give it up too quick.

774
00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:11.780
<v 7>No,
I was just telling him this be before we went on.</v>

775
00:43:12.110 --> 00:43:12.471
I'm like,

776
00:43:12.471 --> 00:43:15.530
someday I probably will go back to smoking weed because I don't find nothing

777
00:43:15.531 --> 00:43:20.060
wrong with it is just at the time where I'm at right now I'm on grind mode so

778
00:43:20.061 --> 00:43:24.440
it's like,
oh,
I don't have time to just be high.
You know what I'm saying?

779
00:43:24.890 --> 00:43:26.510
<v 4>It depends on what you're trying to do.
You know?</v>

780
00:43:26.511 --> 00:43:30.010
Some people are trying to get high because I just want to get fucked up,
not,

781
00:43:30.020 --> 00:43:33.710
I just want to kick back and they just want to just chill out and get fucked up

782
00:43:33.711 --> 00:43:36.160
and just sort of skate their life away and just like,

783
00:43:36.710 --> 00:43:40.670
but we'd makes me more ambitious and I don't know about,
you know,

784
00:43:40.671 --> 00:43:44.960
but we'd makes me like realize like,
damn,
I've got to get some shit done hour now

785
00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:49.360
<v 7>Garrett to be more ambitious than I am.
Are you really ambitious?
It's like,</v>

786
00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:53.010
but not,
not in a,
not in a Hollywood type of way.

787
00:43:53.011 --> 00:43:56.270
Just type of like a life type of way.
Like it's so much like,

788
00:43:56.271 --> 00:44:00.390
it's so much stuff that I'm using comedy for in my life,
you know what I mean?

789
00:44:00.750 --> 00:44:05.430
More than just more than just like TV or some shit like that is just,

790
00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:10.260
you know,
look comedy.
Sometimes it's penance.
I look at it as,
as penance.

791
00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:12.480
Oh yeah.
What do you mean I've done some evil shit.

792
00:44:13.230 --> 00:44:16.360
<v 4>Comedy is somehow or another your,
your punishment for doing this?</v>

793
00:44:16.510 --> 00:44:20.230
<v 7>No,
like penance as far as payback for the evil shit that I've done.</v>

794
00:44:20.260 --> 00:44:25.060
Making people laugh.
Yeah.
Laugh.
It's like Paris or like,
is that the right word?

795
00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:29.540
<v 4>Not Quite.
Maybe.
I see what you're saying though.
Whatever the word is.</v>

796
00:44:29.541 --> 00:44:32.250
I know exactly what you're saying.
Yes,
yes,
yes.
You guess

797
00:44:32.250 --> 00:44:33.390
<v 2>you were right about bleeding.</v>

798
00:44:33.690 --> 00:44:36.370
Guess you were right about me saying that I was smart because I'm using the

799
00:44:36.371 --> 00:44:39.660
wrong fucking worlds and there,
yeah,
that's all.
Well,
you're not a dumb guy,
man.

800
00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:44.720
You know it's match to leash and prop Ameesh said that in a black voice.

801
00:44:45.450 --> 00:44:50.130
Racist.
Fuck.
No,
but it's like,
like,
um,
like,
uh,

802
00:44:50.250 --> 00:44:52.590
like,
uh,
for instance,
um,

803
00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:57.690
I was lucky enough to get with the managers that I got.

804
00:44:57.691 --> 00:45:01.000
You already know who they are,
but it's who's your manager?
Oh,
you just,

805
00:45:01.590 --> 00:45:06.570
I don't pay attention to shit.
I'm mad.
It's about by George Carlin's manager,

806
00:45:06.571 --> 00:45:10.860
man.
Jay Hamza.
Wow.
I like got with them.

807
00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:15.900
That's pretty huge.
Yeah.
And it's like dog.
So as far as me being,

808
00:45:16.650 --> 00:45:19.440
what kind of advice they give you dog,
it sucks for me.

809
00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:27.540
Can you lighten your skin and no,
it's,
I can do a clean set.
No,

810
00:45:27.541 --> 00:45:31.980
it's actually just the opposite man.
Blacker.
No,
not to get a Tan.
No,

811
00:45:31.981 --> 00:45:33.710
not even nigger it up a little dog.

812
00:45:35.170 --> 00:45:40.040
I've actually had people tell me that damn dog tell you I've had it,

813
00:45:40.041 --> 00:45:43.680
dude.
Tell me.
Right there was a manager that told me,

814
00:45:43.681 --> 00:45:47.190
cause I do shit based on the news and Shit.
And he was like,
you know what?

815
00:45:47.730 --> 00:45:51.030
You really should stop reading the newspaper because black people don't read

816
00:45:51.031 --> 00:45:54.740
newspapers.
And I'm like,
what?
Well,
who told you this dog?

817
00:45:54.750 --> 00:45:56.740
It's a fucking agent that Toby,

818
00:45:56.970 --> 00:46:00.030
I've heard some of the worst advice ever from agents and managers.

819
00:46:00.090 --> 00:46:04.290
Here's my favorite.
Kevin James old manager said,
Kevin,
when you lose weight,

820
00:46:04.291 --> 00:46:09.120
you're losing rules.
He told him to not lose weight because if you lose weight,

821
00:46:09.121 --> 00:46:11.950
you're gonna lose parts.
You won't be able to go out for for roles.

822
00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:15.510
You won't be the fat guy like you fuck being healthy.

823
00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:18.300
You're not capable of doing it on your own.

824
00:46:18.450 --> 00:46:20.610
You're here and you're going to get lucky.
Exactly.

825
00:46:20.611 --> 00:46:22.350
We're not going to find some special town you.

826
00:46:22.351 --> 00:46:25.440
He also said that he would never be the lead in anything you're going to

827
00:46:25.710 --> 00:46:28.230
understand just because of your body talking to him.
There would be the lead.

828
00:46:28.470 --> 00:46:29.040
Meanwhile,

829
00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:33.870
the fuck man was on King of Queens or seven years is in movies and make hundreds

830
00:46:33.870 --> 00:46:35.100
of millions.
I just shut the fuck up.
It's just,

831
00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:37.760
it's always added but is always the motherfuckers.

832
00:46:37.770 --> 00:46:40.970
They can't do it that tell you what you,
you can't do.
They make.

833
00:46:40.980 --> 00:46:44.700
See there's the reason being is they make money from you and they want to figure

834
00:46:44.701 --> 00:46:47.130
out what is the way they can make the most money from you.

835
00:46:47.130 --> 00:46:48.900
What is the way you're going to be the most successful?

836
00:46:48.901 --> 00:46:52.050
And they think that they can kind of mold you and get you to become something

837
00:46:52.051 --> 00:46:55.680
that you're not in.
That thing will be more successful,
but they don't understand.

838
00:46:55.681 --> 00:46:58.340
You'll never achieve greatness.
Not that we ever will,
but you know,

839
00:46:58.590 --> 00:47:00.810
I mean you'd never hit the zone instead of achieve greatness.

840
00:47:00.811 --> 00:47:03.840
It sounds very grandiose and I never think about myself that way honestly.

841
00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:07.560
But I do think of hitting the zone and I think you can't hit the zone if you're

842
00:47:07.561 --> 00:47:10.590
trying to pretend to be something that you're not or you're putting on some sort

843
00:47:10.591 --> 00:47:15.450
of an act.
I think you hit the zone when you have like the purest expression of,

844
00:47:15.451 --> 00:47:18.690
of,
of your thoughts on stage in an entertaining form.
He said,

845
00:47:19.010 --> 00:47:20.430
you are your real thoughts.

846
00:47:20.431 --> 00:47:24.570
It's not like cause you cause you to get someone to like you more or you know

847
00:47:24.571 --> 00:47:27.790
you're not dressed.
I've done that before,
dressed away to get people to like,

848
00:47:28.430 --> 00:47:30.220
cause you cause you touch people

849
00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:34.600
<v 5>and more of an authentic type of way if it's you,
you know what I'm saying?</v>

850
00:47:34.970 --> 00:47:38.560
What you feel when you touch the people.

851
00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:40.790
It's the only way you really touched them.
Yeah.

852
00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:45.670
Like and APP and just the opposite with my manager is he has so much money from

853
00:47:45.671 --> 00:47:49.510
Carlin that he's not really in a hurry to make money,

854
00:47:49.630 --> 00:47:54.430
which sucks for me,
but oh well cause he,

855
00:47:54.490 --> 00:47:58.060
cause he doesn't like this is,
this is probably listening right now.

856
00:47:58.630 --> 00:48:01.150
This is one of his favorite sayings cause I was like,
you know,

857
00:48:01.151 --> 00:48:02.770
it was some stuff happening and I,

858
00:48:02.771 --> 00:48:06.430
it was some stuff that I wanted to try out for and he was like,
Ugh,

859
00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:09.520
that's not good for your career in the long haul.
And I'm like,

860
00:48:09.521 --> 00:48:12.360
well I need the money.
And he's like,
will you stop thinking like a,

861
00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:14.130
like a broke ass Nigga and think

862
00:48:15.070 --> 00:48:18.990
<v 4>yeah,
ass nigger.
Yes.
Wow.</v>

863
00:48:19.110 --> 00:48:24.060
Maybe he just took you on it just so he could use those words.
Welcome fetish.

864
00:48:24.430 --> 00:48:29.340
It's his giant woman.
No cause it's like,

865
00:48:29.341 --> 00:48:29.690
no

866
00:48:29.690 --> 00:48:34.550
<v 5>and and he's,
and he's right.
What was it that he told you not to do?</v>

867
00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:38.470
I wanted to try out to try to do def jam [inaudible] jam.

868
00:48:39.090 --> 00:48:43.040
I like comedy central and he was like,
no,
you aren't going to do that shit.

869
00:48:43.100 --> 00:48:46.010
You aren't?
Yeah.
He's like,
you aren't going to dumb down your,

870
00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:48.070
your comedy to be on this bullshit.

871
00:48:48.170 --> 00:48:50.490
<v 4>Here's,
here's the deal,
dude.
You don't have to dumb it down.</v>

872
00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:54.090
You just have to do your best shit just to do some shit is tight or some shit

873
00:48:54.091 --> 00:48:56.390
that's funny and tight.
You don't,
he's silly.

874
00:48:56.860 --> 00:49:01.480
<v 5>What?
But what wound up happening is I wound up getting this special on showtime</v>

875
00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:06.490
instead.
That's uncensored.
That's basically me doing a spot.
That's me.

876
00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:10.600
It's everything that I do.
Which is,
what is that for?
Oh,

877
00:49:10.601 --> 00:49:14.030
it's on next Saturday.
April 23rd on showtime.

878
00:49:14.380 --> 00:49:17.550
It's actually with Jon Lovitz.
Okay.
Is it a what?

879
00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:22.120
What is this is John Leverage presents.
Oh,
okay.

880
00:49:22.420 --> 00:49:27.120
It's a bunch of comics.
Yeah,
it's me,
Quinn,
Dale and he and back.
Okay.
Nine.
Yeah.

881
00:49:27.130 --> 00:49:28.010
It's going to be fun,
man.

882
00:49:28.011 --> 00:49:32.680
And it's like uncensored is all of us doing 15 with John each and shit.

883
00:49:32.710 --> 00:49:33.543
And um,

884
00:49:33.630 --> 00:49:37.740
<v 4>but here's the thing about def jam too,
just to counter your,
your,
your managers.</v>

885
00:49:37.810 --> 00:49:40.990
What he said Dave Chappelle did,
did def jam.
Okay.
Yeah,

886
00:49:40.991 --> 00:49:43.360
but that wouldn't mean that would mean it was necessary though.
Joe.

887
00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:47.410
Didn't everybody do def jam?
That Martin Lawrence to def jam those guys?

888
00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:50.170
That was when it was necessary.
Yeah,
but bro,

889
00:49:50.171 --> 00:49:54.160
it doesn't matter if it's necessary on unnecessary.
It matters.
Is there a stage?

890
00:49:54.161 --> 00:49:57.520
Is there a microphone?
Do you want to do it?
Do you want to do it then go do it.

891
00:49:57.670 --> 00:50:01.480
Really?
Yeah.
You just doing stand up man.
Look is a fuck if it's on def jam.

892
00:50:01.481 --> 00:50:04.540
It's you.
When that,
when they say ladies and gentlemen,
Dow,
right,

893
00:50:04.660 --> 00:50:05.740
and you take that microphone,

894
00:50:05.890 --> 00:50:08.920
it doesn't fucking matter if it's on def jam or if it's on anything.

895
00:50:08.921 --> 00:50:12.520
It's just you.
It's you with a microphone and a stage and the camera on you.

896
00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:16.090
Chappelle has done a few times,
even did the poetry jam.
He's done multiple.

897
00:50:16.091 --> 00:50:18.900
The poetry jam.
That was some ridiculous shit,
man.

898
00:50:19.170 --> 00:50:22.420
You want to talk about some cell phone if you want to write all that sloppy but

899
00:50:22.421 --> 00:50:26.950
to give me some fucking laughs in there.
I am a strong woman.
Grow up in the,

900
00:50:27.590 --> 00:50:30.270
by the time I was six strong,
good.

901
00:50:30.530 --> 00:50:34.940
By the time I was eight iron instead I am what?
I am.

902
00:50:34.941 --> 00:50:39.350
Rise from the fire flames inside of me wanting to burst out,

903
00:50:39.351 --> 00:50:43.160
not wanting to accept my lower class.
Got,
I just made that shit up.

904
00:50:44.490 --> 00:50:48.200
You can go up there and you could write those.
They're easy and they're stupid.

905
00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:50.570
Stop it.
Why is it,
why did it shut up?

906
00:50:50.571 --> 00:50:54.290
Why is it always the light switch was always the light skin.

907
00:50:54.291 --> 00:50:56.360
Black people that write the fucking cause.

908
00:50:56.361 --> 00:51:00.140
They're confusing white mom and a black dad and the white mom is really into

909
00:51:00.141 --> 00:51:04.750
yoga and Tofu.
Black Dad didn't want to stick around as a lot of issues.

910
00:51:05.380 --> 00:51:08.150
You can't really quite rock bread dreadlocks.

911
00:51:08.151 --> 00:51:10.640
She tries but she got up there with the nose ring.

912
00:51:10.641 --> 00:51:14.210
It's spit out that fucking poetry jam 40 that's bullshit.

913
00:51:14.660 --> 00:51:16.460
I should clarify.
I'm bullshitting.

914
00:51:16.461 --> 00:51:18.400
Mostly I'm just playing around because there's something,

915
00:51:18.410 --> 00:51:22.340
I went to a poetry jam breeding wants in Venice and it was kind of interesting.

916
00:51:22.490 --> 00:51:23.990
There was a few people that were legit.

917
00:51:24.110 --> 00:51:26.180
It's like they have that sort of legit thoughts,
you know,

918
00:51:26.181 --> 00:51:29.150
it's like most poetry you saying well what is it?
It's it's horse shit.

919
00:51:29.151 --> 00:51:34.100
It's like it's a bunch of self indulgent,
you know,
wishy washy nonsense.

920
00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:37.910
But then you read like Bukowski,
Bukowski had some poetry that you're like,
whoa.

921
00:51:38.060 --> 00:51:41.300
Like he had a great fucking story about taking a shit,

922
00:51:41.330 --> 00:51:44.210
having a beer shit and his wallet falling into the Shit.

923
00:51:44.210 --> 00:51:47.120
And it was really fucking funny.
But it was basically poetry.

924
00:51:47.300 --> 00:51:49.550
I mean it was poetry and these little little short stories.

925
00:51:49.551 --> 00:51:50.660
Did you ever write poetry too?

926
00:51:50.661 --> 00:51:54.210
Like women are ex girlfriends or anything like that?
Cause I would die out.

927
00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:57.890
Pay Money to read one of your fucking phones.
Good.
Probably.

928
00:51:57.891 --> 00:52:01.550
So I must have,
I can't remember specific.

929
00:52:01.551 --> 00:52:06.200
I know I left some weak ass voicemails.
Oh right.
Well you were,

930
00:52:06.201 --> 00:52:07.220
you're a kid.
First of all,

931
00:52:07.221 --> 00:52:10.070
you get dumped and you don't want to accept it and you want to figure out

932
00:52:10.071 --> 00:52:11.420
there's gotta be a way to get this chip bag.

933
00:52:11.421 --> 00:52:15.470
And so he started trying to pretend and trying to like manipulate the,

934
00:52:15.471 --> 00:52:18.440
you know the situation and pretend you have feelings other than the ones that

935
00:52:18.441 --> 00:52:21.710
you do cause you think it wasn't moving.
It was not even that he wants a pussy.

936
00:52:21.710 --> 00:52:24.650
I think it's like your self esteem doesn't want to accept this person doesn't

937
00:52:24.651 --> 00:52:27.920
like anymore and she just start pretending to be somebody who you're not so

938
00:52:27.921 --> 00:52:31.790
natural,
you know,
so be at one point in time it becomes a game.
It's like,

939
00:52:31.791 --> 00:52:35.900
you know when you teach a chimp that if he puts a bunch of little pegs in order

940
00:52:35.930 --> 00:52:37.490
than a piece of fruit comes out.

941
00:52:37.670 --> 00:52:40.070
Well that chimps going to figure that that's his reward thing,

942
00:52:40.071 --> 00:52:41.750
you know for for a dude,

943
00:52:41.751 --> 00:52:44.750
like you start getting pussy and you start getting love and then all of a sudden

944
00:52:44.751 --> 00:52:45.800
this person breaks up.

945
00:52:46.050 --> 00:52:49.860
Like what little buttons do I have to press to get my apple bank?

946
00:52:50.270 --> 00:52:54.860
You know it's like song once for a check.
I don't play any fucking fucking song.

947
00:52:54.861 --> 00:52:58.280
I didn't know cause it was so unlike me like non top.

948
00:52:58.281 --> 00:53:01.640
Can you talk about it on stage?
Oh my God,
I have to start cause I mean no good.

949
00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:02.860
I never had to sing it.

950
00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:05.960
I swear to God I could've sworn at the time I was thinking like,

951
00:53:05.961 --> 00:53:07.850
well if she sees this come out of me,

952
00:53:07.851 --> 00:53:10.070
I'll just sing it to her without me fucking instruments

953
00:53:12.530 --> 00:53:16.620
and so fucking thankful I never got around to sing in that song.

954
00:53:17.540 --> 00:53:22.540
Is there any one thing in life that's more embarrassing than a song that you

955
00:53:24.321 --> 00:53:26.070
sing to a tells

956
00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:27.900
<v 2>you that song socks and</v>

957
00:53:29.700 --> 00:53:31.470
you write a song and he'd go,
listen,

958
00:53:31.490 --> 00:53:33.810
if you don't talk to me after today and for the rest of your life,

959
00:53:33.900 --> 00:53:35.970
I just want you to know that I wrote this for you to sit down,

960
00:53:35.971 --> 00:53:39.870
please listen to this.
And then at the end she's like,
that was fucking terrible.

961
00:53:39.871 --> 00:53:43.650
I'm so glad I had dumped you.
You are sad,
pathetic.

962
00:53:43.770 --> 00:53:48.720
Fuck you made a shit of soil for me.
You asked him like,
man,
Shit,

963
00:53:49.020 --> 00:53:53.070
now I'm on some man.
Shit,
I'm going to put that on my Wikipedia.

964
00:53:53.071 --> 00:53:57.240
Somebody I know.
By the way,
I've never edited my Wikipedia.
I don't touch it.

965
00:53:57.241 --> 00:53:59.700
I'll never even read it.
I don't correct bad things.

966
00:53:59.701 --> 00:54:02.510
So if you want to just make some shit up,
if you want to look put,

967
00:54:02.580 --> 00:54:06.890
please feel free.
But I want that on there,
Joe.
Rosa,
man,
Shit,

968
00:54:06.930 --> 00:54:08.870
I'm on some mad shit.
Okay,
now

969
00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:12.270
that's just my only request.

970
00:54:12.910 --> 00:54:15.780
I have to write any credits and they don't really have to make a t shirt that

971
00:54:15.781 --> 00:54:19.610
says I'm on some manage.
I don't have crones disease either.
So please stop email.

972
00:54:19.620 --> 00:54:24.300
Yes,
fellow crones sufferers.
I appreciate your illness,

973
00:54:24.301 --> 00:54:26.800
but I just,
I feel bad that all these people think that I have because

974
00:54:28.430 --> 00:54:32.010
Ricky Pedia,
they just make shit up Wikipedia.
It also says Brian Collins,

975
00:54:32.011 --> 00:54:34.680
my brother,
you know was,
I don't change it.
He's my brother.

976
00:54:34.740 --> 00:54:35.700
As far as I'm concerned,

977
00:54:35.701 --> 00:54:39.420
I've had like 10 Wikipedia is and they automatically get could just get to lead

978
00:54:39.421 --> 00:54:40.970
it because it's the most retarded shit.

979
00:54:40.971 --> 00:54:45.170
Like there's not even a one sentence that was ever real and then it doesn't want

980
00:54:45.180 --> 00:54:50.040
worst.
The absolute worst is when you know a dude wrote his own Wikipedia.

981
00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:54.330
Is there anything creepy or in life and reading some dudes thing like you know,

982
00:54:54.331 --> 00:54:58.770
and an honored and cherished member of the comedy community.

983
00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:03.590
He has been yelling,
dude,
fuck yeah,
they do to fuck.
Yeah,
they do.
Yeah.
I've,

984
00:55:03.591 --> 00:55:06.360
I've read sports casters that I'm known like colic,

985
00:55:06.361 --> 00:55:08.850
fight commentators that I know.
They wrote their own shit.

986
00:55:08.970 --> 00:55:11.100
I've read it for Comedians.
I know they wrote their own shit.

987
00:55:11.101 --> 00:55:11.761
You read and you're like,

988
00:55:11.761 --> 00:55:16.761
what the fuck is this nonsense breath of fresh air in a stagnant comedy

989
00:55:17.881 --> 00:55:18.714
community

990
00:55:20.050 --> 00:55:24.720
food when you're talking about what am I doing wrong where I would never do no

991
00:55:24.721 --> 00:55:28.530
shit like what are you doing?
Right?
Of course you wouldn't do that.
That's insane.

992
00:55:28.950 --> 00:55:29.810
Listen man,
you,

993
00:55:29.811 --> 00:55:34.470
you got to spend as little time as possible like projecting who you want people

994
00:55:34.471 --> 00:55:36.690
to think you are.
Do that shit through your work.

995
00:55:36.900 --> 00:55:39.580
If you've got somebody that wants to write a bio for you or you,

996
00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:44.070
if you write a bio of your own,
it better be silly dog blowing yourself up.

997
00:55:44.220 --> 00:55:47.700
I know third time on stage I let to present or no,

998
00:55:47.820 --> 00:55:50.430
this was going to be the next big star of comedy.

999
00:55:50.550 --> 00:55:53.550
I sh I held myself to up to that standard.
I've had it ever since.

1000
00:55:53.551 --> 00:55:54.480
That would be hilarious.

1001
00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:59.940
That's actually what I'm going through right now is like this management team.

1002
00:55:59.970 --> 00:56:02.160
They want me to help write a bio and I'm like,

1003
00:56:02.161 --> 00:56:05.010
what the fuck am I supposed to say man?
Well,
you know,
I mean look,

1004
00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:09.390
you should help write it because it's your [inaudible].
Am I supposed to say?

1005
00:56:09.391 --> 00:56:14.070
I don't know why some are low funny man.
Just be funny about it.
Just look,

1006
00:56:14.130 --> 00:56:17.140
if you're going to write a bio man,
this is why I say if you're a calm,
I don't,

1007
00:56:17.150 --> 00:56:18.060
I didn't write my bio.

1008
00:56:18.061 --> 00:56:20.720
My Bio is written by someone else and it's embarrassing and I don't like

1009
00:56:21.870 --> 00:56:24.010
taekwondo stuff there and I was shit that

1010
00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:26.380
<v 1>I would never put in there.
If I was going to rewrite my bio,</v>

1011
00:56:26.381 --> 00:56:30.220
I would definitely have to make it funny.
You have to make it silly.

1012
00:56:30.221 --> 00:56:32.860
As silly as possible.
He'll make up some shit,

1013
00:56:32.890 --> 00:56:35.170
make up some shit about unicorn wrestling.

1014
00:56:35.370 --> 00:56:39.040
You know whatever the fuck you're going to do.
But when you read,

1015
00:56:39.041 --> 00:56:44.041
when you read someone's like really self congratulatory bio's and how they

1016
00:56:44.561 --> 00:56:48.220
really view themselves like,
oh it's disgusting.

1017
00:56:48.370 --> 00:56:51.430
You can't even enjoy them on stage cause you think all this guy's doing is he

1018
00:56:51.431 --> 00:56:52.550
just wants you to think he's

1019
00:56:55.390 --> 00:57:00.010
jacking himself off for one of the most unpleasant things is someone who takes

1020
00:57:00.011 --> 00:57:03.880
himself way too seriously.
That's insane up there.
You know,

1021
00:57:03.881 --> 00:57:07.420
trying to make you laugh and there everything's a joke.
I said to them,

1022
00:57:07.540 --> 00:57:11.920
how about comics that try shit out on you?
Hey man,
how about this bit?

1023
00:57:12.130 --> 00:57:15.310
I'm thinking about doing it whole stage.
Hey folks,
have you ever known?

1024
00:57:15.311 --> 00:57:18.500
Is that when you,
you know like trying to on you,

1025
00:57:18.610 --> 00:57:20.170
<v 7>you know what,
what,
what?</v>

1026
00:57:20.260 --> 00:57:25.260
What are suffer from is I hate when you're off stage and you can tell it's

1027
00:57:25.721 --> 00:57:30.110
coming.
Yeah.
I'm saying this isn't a conversation.
This is a setup,

1028
00:57:30.530 --> 00:57:31.680
like you got your set up,

1029
00:57:33.130 --> 00:57:37.340
<v 1>he's faking a conversation and to get to his job.
Exactly.
And you're like,</v>

1030
00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:39.400
motherfucker,
you practicing materials on me?
Yeah.

1031
00:57:39.401 --> 00:57:41.470
At least if like you're a comic and you say,
Hey dude,

1032
00:57:41.471 --> 00:57:43.570
I've got a problem with this bit,
Tuck it back.
Exactly.

1033
00:57:43.571 --> 00:57:47.110
That's kind of get out of this book,
you know.
I mean we all have bits,
right?

1034
00:57:47.111 --> 00:57:49.840
Don't you have a bit,
I mean I,
I've had a few bits where I'm like,
Damn,

1035
00:57:49.841 --> 00:57:52.820
how do I get out of this motherfucker?
Like I got all these laughs but uh,

1036
00:57:52.830 --> 00:57:54.790
how do I get out of this?
There's no way to get out of it.

1037
00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:58.740
It's like a segway where is it just ends on a cliff and then you,

1038
00:57:58.741 --> 00:58:00.310
you sometimes you can do it.
That's good.

1039
00:58:00.520 --> 00:58:04.150
<v 7>See that's why.
That's why I really don't hang out as much.</v>

1040
00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:07.270
Like you see me at comedy clubs,
but I believe know,

1041
00:58:07.271 --> 00:58:10.000
hang out with like a whole bunch of comics because it's like,

1042
00:58:10.001 --> 00:58:11.290
I like real conversations.

1043
00:58:11.291 --> 00:58:15.520
Like I like going to bars and just hanging out and stuff like that and just

1044
00:58:15.521 --> 00:58:16.354
talking to people.

1045
00:58:16.440 --> 00:58:19.050
<v 1>You can have real conversations with comics.
It's just not on,</v>

1046
00:58:19.890 --> 00:58:21.140
you got to find the right call me.

1047
00:58:21.440 --> 00:58:23.510
<v 7>See this is,
this is,
this is what happened to me.</v>

1048
00:58:23.511 --> 00:58:27.200
Like when I moved out to Los Angeles,
like you,

1049
00:58:27.590 --> 00:58:30.050
you and some other comics and guys were,

1050
00:58:30.070 --> 00:58:33.200
were we're lucky cause you have comics in your class per se.

1051
00:58:33.201 --> 00:58:35.070
It's like dudes that you came up through the rights.

1052
00:58:35.730 --> 00:58:39.350
Well I moved out to La and I was in a weird circumstance cause I was like kind

1053
00:58:39.351 --> 00:58:41.570
of by myself moving out here by myself.

1054
00:58:42.170 --> 00:58:45.680
I really didn't fit in on open mic circuit but I wasn't a headliner.

1055
00:58:45.681 --> 00:58:49.760
So I was right in the middle because I had spent so much time in New York kind

1056
00:58:49.820 --> 00:58:53.690
of getting seasoned.
So I wasn't quite an open miker as far as my skill,

1057
00:58:53.691 --> 00:58:55.130
but as far as my notoriety.

1058
00:58:55.310 --> 00:58:58.700
But I wasn't a headliner cause I didn't have that type of pool.

1059
00:58:58.701 --> 00:59:01.400
So I was really stuck in the middle of some shit.

1060
00:59:01.401 --> 00:59:05.600
And then you have classes of comics that all grew up together,

1061
00:59:05.601 --> 00:59:08.960
so I really can't bounce shit off of.
I know what you're saying.
You know,

1062
00:59:08.970 --> 00:59:12.470
so was hard.
It was really good.
Like that's the one thing,

1063
00:59:12.500 --> 00:59:17.060
that's the one thing that I wished that I had come to la earlier or maybe later,

1064
00:59:17.420 --> 00:59:22.070
not when I did,
is because if I come earlier,
I would have group of people,

1065
00:59:22.230 --> 00:59:23.650
you know what I'm saying?
You have that group,

1066
00:59:23.690 --> 00:59:26.810
<v 1>the name,
she never think like that.
He came at the exact right time for you.</v>

1067
00:59:27.170 --> 00:59:28.520
We can't ever think like that.
You know,

1068
00:59:28.700 --> 00:59:31.640
there's a self defeating thoughts like that don't get you anywhere.
I'm like,
man,

1069
00:59:31.641 --> 00:59:35.540
if I had just come this,
you know,
it's good to be around a group of people,

1070
00:59:35.541 --> 00:59:38.860
but it's also good to be around some people that are way ahead of you and your,

1071
00:59:38.861 --> 00:59:39.630
your force,

1072
00:59:39.630 --> 00:59:43.760
you're forced to pick up the pace and celebrate to their frequency has been

1073
00:59:43.761 --> 00:59:46.360
lucky.
I've been lucky as hell on that level

1074
00:59:46.470 --> 00:59:51.390
<v 7>because,
and that goes back to to the competition aspect of me.
It's like,
um,</v>

1075
00:59:51.460 --> 00:59:53.640
uh,
just as far as man working with you,

1076
00:59:53.790 --> 00:59:58.790
I've done shows with Bill Burgess thought well fucking fire as comics and it's

1077
00:59:59.071 --> 01:00:03.120
like dog.
It's just these dudes are so tight that it's just like,

1078
01:00:03.150 --> 01:00:06.600
it makes you look at your own shit and say,
I gotta tighten this shit up.

1079
01:00:06.990 --> 01:00:10.410
That's what,
that's what I'm supposed to be doing.
Not the jokes,

1080
01:00:10.411 --> 01:00:14.250
but that's how it's supposed to be and this is what I'm doing so I'm doing

1081
01:00:14.251 --> 01:00:15.690
something wrong.
You know what I mean?

1082
01:00:16.110 --> 01:00:18.780
<v 1>Right.
I know what you mean.
It's like that type of shit.
Yeah,
that's,</v>

1083
01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:22.410
that's one of the best things about being around a high level comedians like in

1084
01:00:22.411 --> 01:00:27.240
La,
like you get to see like real high level stuff and be inspired by it and it

1085
01:00:27.241 --> 01:00:29.970
makes your own,
like you recognize what you like about that,
you know,

1086
01:00:29.971 --> 01:00:30.781
like what does it old man,

1087
01:00:30.781 --> 01:00:32.840
he's got like very little time in between his punchlines.

1088
01:00:32.850 --> 01:00:35.970
You hit you hard with it and then like,
oh,
you know,
you,
you,
you see that.

1089
01:00:35.971 --> 01:00:38.730
You're like,
what am I enjoying and how come I'm not my pace?

1090
01:00:38.731 --> 01:00:40.530
I need to pick my pace up.
I need to do this.

1091
01:00:40.531 --> 01:00:43.560
Maybe I have too many words in these jokes.
Maybe you know,
maybe it's a,
you know,

1092
01:00:43.561 --> 01:00:44.670
so that it's,
it's fine.

1093
01:00:44.830 --> 01:00:46.210
<v 7>Yeah.
And then the whole,</v>

1094
01:00:46.211 --> 01:00:49.930
the whole one thing that really trips me out about you is,

1095
01:00:49.931 --> 01:00:54.931
and I'll tell him that dog is so cool to know Joe because the funny part is he

1096
01:00:55.211 --> 01:00:59.480
doesn't have to be funny,
but he works at being funny.
Like,
like,

1097
01:01:00.010 --> 01:01:02.860
like looking at all these stars,
doing comedy nowadays.
Like you,

1098
01:01:02.861 --> 01:01:07.540
you could go out just as the UFC dude and make money.
I mean that's not you,

1099
01:01:07.541 --> 01:01:08.710
but you could do that.

1100
01:01:08.770 --> 01:01:13.770
But like for you to even bother to work at this craft and,

1101
01:01:14.050 --> 01:01:16.360
and actually be funny and work at it though,

1102
01:01:16.420 --> 01:01:19.420
that says something about your personality dog because you really don't got to

1103
01:01:19.421 --> 01:01:20.254
do it.

1104
01:01:20.820 --> 01:01:24.420
<v 1>But I do because it's,
it's what makes me better at everything I do.
It makes me,</v>

1105
01:01:24.630 --> 01:01:27.690
it makes me a better commentator.
You know,
being,

1106
01:01:27.691 --> 01:01:30.750
doing standup I think makes me better as a human being.
It makes me,

1107
01:01:30.751 --> 01:01:33.300
it forces me to think about things when a whole nother level,

1108
01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:37.260
it forces me to consider every single angle of every single subject,

1109
01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:41.120
whether it's something that's going on nuclear problem in China or you know,

1110
01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:44.550
financial bullshit,
whatever the fuck it is.
When I'm,
when you're a comic man,
you,

1111
01:01:44.551 --> 01:01:47.820
you start probing things.
Not just because you're curious about it,

1112
01:01:47.940 --> 01:01:48.920
but also because like,
what,

1113
01:01:48.930 --> 01:01:52.350
is there a joke in here in which the angle of this fucking thing,
what's wrong?

1114
01:01:52.380 --> 01:01:53.970
How could this have been avoided?
Well,
what the fuck?

1115
01:01:54.060 --> 01:01:57.800
How come they didn't do that?
There's a joke.
You know what I mean?
Like that's,

1116
01:01:57.801 --> 01:01:58.740
that's a lot of times

1117
01:01:58.850 --> 01:02:02.350
<v 7>landed my,
it's really expanded my view on life.</v>

1118
01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:05.820
<v 1>Yeah.
And just a lot of fun.
You'll do it forever,</v>

1119
01:02:06.090 --> 01:02:07.500
but whatever else comes,

1120
01:02:07.590 --> 01:02:10.440
that's the one thing you'll realize is that comedy is the most fun.

1121
01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:11.730
It's the most rewarding.

1122
01:02:11.910 --> 01:02:15.600
And like even a fucking hundred people are at 80 tomorrow night or tonight

1123
01:02:15.601 --> 01:02:18.330
rather.
We're doing south comedy hall.
There'll be 80 people there tonight.

1124
01:02:18.370 --> 01:02:20.790
You come in,
you're going do it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's awesome place.

1125
01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:21.990
Southcom he holds his shit.

1126
01:02:21.991 --> 01:02:24.600
If you never been were there tonight where they're almost every Wednesday,

1127
01:02:24.601 --> 01:02:25.440
I won't be there next week,

1128
01:02:25.710 --> 01:02:29.910
but almost every Wednesday it's on Melrose Street and it's this fun little tight

1129
01:02:29.911 --> 01:02:33.330
ass club.
And we go in there and when we,
when we fuck around and it's,

1130
01:02:33.670 --> 01:02:35.160
here's my point,
what the hell was I talking about before

1131
01:02:35.380 --> 01:02:40.380
<v 7>as far as expanding your mind as far as how you think and then doing comedy</v>

1132
01:02:40.811 --> 01:02:43.030
forever.
And that's the most fun that you had.
Yeah,

1133
01:02:43.210 --> 01:02:45.580
<v 1>it's the most fun.
It's the point was,
yeah,</v>

1134
01:02:45.820 --> 01:02:48.970
it doesn't matter if it's ADP boat or if it's fucking,
you know,
Toronto,

1135
01:02:48.971 --> 01:02:51.460
April 29th I'm doing this 2,500 people,
you know,

1136
01:02:51.461 --> 01:02:56.290
it's almost sold out to 2,500 fucking people.
I did 1800 in Seattle.
It's a,

1137
01:02:56.291 --> 01:03:00.460
you know,
you do these giant fucking shows.
There are fun as shit,
but guess what?

1138
01:03:00.461 --> 01:03:04.720
It's also fun to do 50 fucking people.
It's fun.
It's fun to do a late night show.

1139
01:03:04.721 --> 01:03:08.260
You stop in on a Wednesday night at the Improv and you'd go on last and it's the

1140
01:03:08.261 --> 01:03:11.290
10:00 PM show and there's a hundred people in that audience and they're tired

1141
01:03:11.291 --> 01:03:14.290
and it's still fun as shit.
It doesn't matter if it's on television,
it doesn't.

1142
01:03:14.710 --> 01:03:16.540
When you start getting good at comedy,

1143
01:03:16.541 --> 01:03:20.800
you will realize that that is the number one fun thing to do as an entertainer.

1144
01:03:20.860 --> 01:03:24.670
So all my other shit that I do,
I kind of do like also,

1145
01:03:24.910 --> 01:03:26.500
but if I had to choose one,
it would,

1146
01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:28.280
<v 7>I was thinking like it for sure.</v>

1147
01:03:28.340 --> 01:03:31.430
Like if like if somebody took everything away and said,
all you

1148
01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:34.650
<v 1>do is one thing,
we wouldn't even be close.
There's,</v>

1149
01:03:34.651 --> 01:03:38.520
I wouldn't say there's no way I would just do commentating for the UFC because

1150
01:03:38.521 --> 01:03:41.250
I'm a fucking fan of fighting of,
of MMA.

1151
01:03:41.251 --> 01:03:46.080
I would be a fan just as big if I never worked with UFC a day in my life.

1152
01:03:46.290 --> 01:03:48.360
If tomorrow do,
UFC called me up and said,

1153
01:03:48.361 --> 01:03:53.220
go fuck yourself were higher and Mario Lopez
getting old,

1154
01:03:53.221 --> 01:03:56.820
dude,
it's over.
If they,
if they did that and I'd be like,
all right,

1155
01:03:56.821 --> 01:03:58.860
I guess I'm just watching on TV from now on.
It'd be,

1156
01:03:58.861 --> 01:04:00.330
I would watch the same amount of fights.

1157
01:04:00.331 --> 01:04:03.750
I wouldn't be there for the prelims cause I wouldn't see the live shows.
Dude,

1158
01:04:03.751 --> 01:04:05.490
I probably watched the same amount of televised.

1159
01:04:05.730 --> 01:04:07.290
<v 7>So that's,
that's,
that's like,</v>

1160
01:04:07.370 --> 01:04:11.130
and that's one of the theories that I've always had is like,
Doug,

1161
01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:12.990
I want to do this for the rest of my life.

1162
01:04:13.050 --> 01:04:16.080
So that's why I guess you were an artist.
You know,
I'm,

1163
01:04:16.090 --> 01:04:18.900
I guess that's why I'm not really in a hurry for a lot of things.

1164
01:04:18.901 --> 01:04:23.340
Like this is going to be my,
my,
my first TV credit of any kind ever.
Man,

1165
01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:27.130
<v 1>we'll make you better at everything else you try to do to see if you want to try</v>

1166
01:04:27.131 --> 01:04:28.420
to do something else.
Like say if you try to,

1167
01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:31.690
one day you want to host a talk show or one day you want to do some other kind

1168
01:04:31.691 --> 01:04:35.200
of a television show,
you're going to get better at it because you're a comic.

1169
01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:38.140
It makes you,
it's the hardest.
It's the most rewarding,

1170
01:04:38.141 --> 01:04:41.650
but it's also the most difficult form in my opinion of of talking.

1171
01:04:41.690 --> 01:04:43.430
<v 7>So how do you like feel about these,</v>

1172
01:04:43.460 --> 01:04:48.460
these dudes that just run out here cause they and put together the comedy

1173
01:04:48.771 --> 01:04:49.640
towards just because

1174
01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:51.080
<v 1>I think as I've gotten older,</v>

1175
01:04:51.081 --> 01:04:54.740
one thing that I've gotten really good at is finding who to get mad at and who

1176
01:04:54.741 --> 01:04:56.060
it's a waste of time to get mad at.

1177
01:04:56.390 --> 01:04:58.550
And one of the things it's a waste of time to get mad at.

1178
01:04:58.580 --> 01:05:01.390
It's some person just trying to make it,
what does,
who gives a,

1179
01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:02.570
who gives a fuck what they're doing,

1180
01:05:02.780 --> 01:05:07.190
whether they're doing some stupid fucking game show on television like I did,

1181
01:05:07.191 --> 01:05:09.020
whether they're doing,
you know,
they're,
they're,

1182
01:05:09.021 --> 01:05:11.960
they're trying to do stand up comedy when they're 37 years old and they're just

1183
01:05:11.961 --> 01:05:13.880
coming off a sitcom and they never done standup ever.

1184
01:05:14.140 --> 01:05:16.400
It would it just fucking look at Charlie Murphy,

1185
01:05:16.430 --> 01:05:20.500
who's a good of mine match Holly Murphy.
I admire the fuck out of what he did.

1186
01:05:20.870 --> 01:05:25.180
He would,
Charlie,
Charlie Murphy jumped right in as a headliner.
Right.

1187
01:05:25.230 --> 01:05:28.900
Then he went,
he and I went on the road.
We did 22 gigs together.
Okay.

1188
01:05:28.901 --> 01:05:32.050
And this guy had only been doing comedy for like a couple of years.
Right?

1189
01:05:32.550 --> 01:05:35.680
Two years.
We're doing thousands of cedars,
you know,

1190
01:05:35.681 --> 01:05:39.160
20002000500 seaters,
giant fucking places.

1191
01:05:39.340 --> 01:05:43.090
And Charlie's going on after me and I'm doing an hour,
I'm doing an hour,
we're,

1192
01:05:43.091 --> 01:05:45.190
we're,
we're co headlining.
Oh,
we did this.

1193
01:05:45.191 --> 01:05:48.790
We went back and forth and back and forth.
That mother fucker's got balls.

1194
01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:52.660
He just jumped into the fire.
So I mean,
you know,
these people go,

1195
01:05:52.750 --> 01:05:55.300
these fucking goes,
hey,
these fucking goes,
they think you're a comic.

1196
01:05:55.301 --> 01:05:56.690
You're not a comic yet.
Yo,

1197
01:05:56.730 --> 01:06:00.520
Dr Dies trying to be a comic and so is Steve Steevo and so is,
you know,

1198
01:06:00.521 --> 01:06:04.360
other people that they get into it,
man,
it's fun.
There's room for more.

1199
01:06:04.420 --> 01:06:06.010
Everybody can be a comic.
No,

1200
01:06:06.011 --> 01:06:08.830
it can be an 80 year old doctor and one day you decide,
you know what,

1201
01:06:09.010 --> 01:06:11.440
I want to do some fucking stand up and I'll tell you what.

1202
01:06:11.441 --> 01:06:15.160
If you go on stage and you kick some ass,
comics will take you right in,
right?

1203
01:06:15.161 --> 01:06:17.740
Don't you see that?
Like will like you and I,
when we met,

1204
01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:22.690
here's the language that we understood.
You're funny.
You're funny.
I'm a comic.

1205
01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:26.350
You're calm.
Like this kid's a comic.
He's fucking funny.
Boom,
you're in.

1206
01:06:26.470 --> 01:06:29.680
You know that's how it is.
But a real comics don't ever like say,
Oh,

1207
01:06:29.681 --> 01:06:32.050
this guy's a headliner,
but this guy's an opener.

1208
01:06:32.051 --> 01:06:35.710
We can't talk to him and would real comics you're in when you're in.

1209
01:06:35.780 --> 01:06:38.060
<v 7>Yeah.
Funny is funny,
but that's the,
that's the,</v>

1210
01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:42.590
that's the thing that I think helped me out a lot is when I stopped getting mad

1211
01:06:42.591 --> 01:06:47.420
at everybody.
At the end of the day,
I'm still a comedy fan,
man.
I love a good,

1212
01:06:47.740 --> 01:06:50.170
<v 1>even if they serve a good land,
if they suck,
just don't listen.</v>

1213
01:06:50.171 --> 01:06:53.170
Just get out of the room when they're on stage.
Right.
There's guys that suck.
Man.

1214
01:06:53.171 --> 01:06:56.680
I can't watch them on stage cause it hurts my head.
You know what I'm saying?

1215
01:06:56.740 --> 01:06:57.240
Like,
you know,

1216
01:06:57.240 --> 01:07:01.030
it hurts what what they're doing is so out of whack and it's not funny.

1217
01:07:01.031 --> 01:07:02.170
And so unaware.

1218
01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:06.340
It almost like screws up my sense of comedy and I get confused and I don't want

1219
01:07:06.341 --> 01:07:09.300
to go on stage and have,
when you're on stage,
man,
if you're,

1220
01:07:09.310 --> 01:07:13.480
there's a person on stage and they're really rocking it,
you get into their mind,

1221
01:07:13.481 --> 01:07:16.660
man,
you were on their frequency,
whether it's,
you know,

1222
01:07:16.661 --> 01:07:21.160
Joe Diaz or Louie Ck,
Louis Ck is a great example of that.
He's a great comic.

1223
01:07:21.161 --> 01:07:22.030
But one of the things he does,

1224
01:07:22.031 --> 01:07:26.050
it's really great is he pulls you into the way he's thinking.
You know,

1225
01:07:26.051 --> 01:07:29.440
he pulls you in to how he's looking things and you start thinking the way he

1226
01:07:29.441 --> 01:07:32.080
thinks as he's doing it.
And it's hilarious.
And that's one of the,

1227
01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:36.490
but when someone's got some whack ass thoughts and there unedited and they're

1228
01:07:36.491 --> 01:07:41.340
sloppy and they're stupid and the shit they're saying makes no fucking sense and

1229
01:07:41.341 --> 01:07:45.070
it's all shut up.
That's gotta leave the room.
But you can't be mad at him.

1230
01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:47.950
The Guy who trying to do his thing,
he just can't do it.
Oh No.

1231
01:07:48.250 --> 01:07:51.400
I used to get mad at them.
I used to get mad at people.
That sucked.

1232
01:07:51.401 --> 01:07:53.770
I used to get mad at,
especially if there were more successful than me,

1233
01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:54.753
I would get mad.

1234
01:07:55.150 --> 01:07:59.470
<v 7>I am,
I am so glad that I'm past that because I had a problem with,</v>

1235
01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:04.090
if I'm onstage and I'm bitter,
I suck.
As long as I'm having fun,
I'm good.

1236
01:08:04.250 --> 01:08:07.250
Like we're not necessarily fine,
but as long as you know,

1237
01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:12.220
I had to take the bitterness out of my act because it was funny,
but it wasn't.

1238
01:08:12.730 --> 01:08:15.330
It was like people were like,
that might be too much.
Right.

1239
01:08:15.331 --> 01:08:19.520
So once I got that bitterness out where you know what to each his own and just

1240
01:08:19.521 --> 01:08:24.290
like you were saying is wrong for all of us.
But I just wish that,

1241
01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:25.550
you know,
like for instance,

1242
01:08:25.551 --> 01:08:30.551
one of my big pet peeves is I wish that white comics could see whatever they

1243
01:08:31.821 --> 01:08:36.770
want to because that would free black comics up in a way.

1244
01:08:36.771 --> 01:08:38.360
And I know it sounds crazy,
but

1245
01:08:38.580 --> 01:08:40.530
<v 1>boy,
why comics to pretty much say whatever they want.</v>

1246
01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:44.820
<v 7>Yeah,
but y'all don't,
y'all can't say the n word.
You can't say fat like,
well,</v>

1247
01:08:44.821 --> 01:08:45.840
you can't get away with no one.

1248
01:08:46.020 --> 01:08:50.520
I can get away with saying Faggot a lot easier than your average white comic

1249
01:08:50.521 --> 01:08:51.930
could just cause I'm a black guy.

1250
01:08:52.050 --> 01:08:56.780
<v 1>Disagree.
When Jim Norton says Faggot,
it comes out.
It's like poetry,
music.
True.</v>

1251
01:08:56.920 --> 01:08:59.140
<v 7>Well,
there's,
I mean,
but that's put,</v>

1252
01:08:59.230 --> 01:09:01.590
but that's one of the baddest comics going I'm talking

1253
01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:03.520
<v 1>was he's a real comic anyway,</v>

1254
01:09:04.510 --> 01:09:06.070
<v 7>but even,
but even,
sorry,</v>

1255
01:09:06.071 --> 01:09:09.970
black comics can say faggot and not have a point and they don't get in any type

1256
01:09:10.030 --> 01:09:12.250
<v 1>in trouble or it's not a trial type of trouble board.</v>

1257
01:09:12.260 --> 01:09:14.810
They do do as the audience loses a little bit of respect for him,

1258
01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:18.560
especially if it doesn't belong.
If it doesn't go on what they're saying,

1259
01:09:18.780 --> 01:09:20.480
if they just didn't have a shotgun or they're doing it,

1260
01:09:20.481 --> 01:09:21.940
it's an ignorant with things that they're saying.

1261
01:09:22.380 --> 01:09:25.700
They're saying you lose value with the audience.
You lose a,

1262
01:09:25.820 --> 01:09:29.180
they don't respect the connection that you've made.
They'll let you keep going,

1263
01:09:29.390 --> 01:09:34.370
but there's lost,
lost a piece of respect.
And that's really what's going on,
man.

1264
01:09:34.371 --> 01:09:37.880
If you,
if you go up there with your thoughts,
your thoughts are,
you know,
you,
you,

1265
01:09:37.881 --> 01:09:40.360
you have to hone them down to the,
to the,

1266
01:09:40.430 --> 01:09:44.300
the best of your abilities to get them into these people's minds with the most,

1267
01:09:44.420 --> 01:09:46.580
the less,
the least ego possible,

1268
01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:50.120
the most amount of respect for the person's attention span and the most amount

1269
01:09:50.121 --> 01:09:52.360
of focus on the material,
like the most,

1270
01:09:52.670 --> 01:09:57.470
so that you can hit po points and notes and have ideas that they didn't come up

1271
01:09:57.471 --> 01:09:59.870
with.
Like they didn't even say,
wow,
I never even looked at it that way.

1272
01:10:00.190 --> 01:10:02.030
That's one of the best things about comedy,
man.

1273
01:10:02.150 --> 01:10:05.720
When someone makes you laugh about some shit and then they point out one thing

1274
01:10:05.721 --> 01:10:09.050
and you're like,
fuck it,
that's so true,
man.
That is so ridiculous.
They have,

1275
01:10:09.051 --> 01:10:11.780
why are they doing that?
You know,
what the fuck?
Why aren't they,

1276
01:10:12.380 --> 01:10:13.400
why aren't they doing this?

1277
01:10:13.490 --> 01:10:15.080
<v 7>Just like,
I'm just like,</v>

1278
01:10:15.770 --> 01:10:20.690
what happens with me a lot of times is like you,
um,

1279
01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:25.300
I'll,
I'll talk about jail but I also talk.
Yeah.

1280
01:10:25.410 --> 01:10:27.960
<v 1>How do you bring that up?
I'm going to shut a crack head</v>

1281
01:10:28.300 --> 01:10:30.910
<v 7>basically.
Well it actually comes after me talking about,</v>

1282
01:10:31.210 --> 01:10:35.800
well it actually talks about me paying paying taxes now,
which is,

1283
01:10:35.830 --> 01:10:38.020
which is a concept that is fascinating to me.

1284
01:10:38.021 --> 01:10:42.360
Like I just started paying taxes like three years ago and this whole tax payer

1285
01:10:42.370 --> 01:10:45.700
concept fascinates me and people find it weird.

1286
01:10:45.701 --> 01:10:50.170
But what you got to understand his dog,
you don't pay taxes on a dope money.

1287
01:10:50.171 --> 01:10:50.910
So it's like

1288
01:10:50.910 --> 01:10:53.700
<v 1>worried though that they're gonna come after you for now that you talk about it</v>

1289
01:10:53.701 --> 01:10:55.980
on stage and shit the one day the IRS ago,
listen,

1290
01:10:56.130 --> 01:10:59.250
you owe us money from selling coke.
Come and get it.

1291
01:10:59.251 --> 01:11:02.650
Cause I don't know how much I fucking made.
And they don't,

1292
01:11:03.010 --> 01:11:05.480
they go bring crackheads and bring them in the courtroom.

1293
01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:08.490
They would never be able to talk about that.
They bought off.

1294
01:11:10.970 --> 01:11:14.340
I bought $1 million half of crack off motherfucker.
Really?

1295
01:11:15.450 --> 01:11:18.490
<v 4>Where did you get to rob a bank?
And this is my fucking,</v>

1296
01:11:18.500 --> 01:11:21.660
show me your main downswing.
That's the beauty of comments and Louis in June.

1297
01:11:21.661 --> 01:11:22.830
Now the speech as a joke

1298
01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:25.350
<v 7>and then,
but that's where the whole,</v>

1299
01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:29.130
that's where the whole thing about going to jail comes in is after I talk about

1300
01:11:29.131 --> 01:11:30.000
paying taxes now

1301
01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:32.990
<v 4>can you go to jail for two years for shooting somebody?
What's that all about?</v>

1302
01:11:33.260 --> 01:11:36.110
<v 7>Because of the intent.
It was oil.
Yeah,
it was,
well,</v>

1303
01:11:36.111 --> 01:11:38.730
I mean you weren't trying to kill the guy.
I can't really talk about this.
Okay,

1304
01:11:38.740 --> 01:11:42.080
well I proved that I can put it like that word,
put it like this.

1305
01:11:42.260 --> 01:11:43.340
They never found a gun.

1306
01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:46.700
So it was one of those things where the guy knew that I shot him,

1307
01:11:46.701 --> 01:11:50.300
but they never found the gun and everybody it's you say I didn't shoot him.

1308
01:11:50.980 --> 01:11:53.570
I didn't bother.
That was,
that was me making a deal.

1309
01:11:53.571 --> 01:11:55.730
Like I wasn't going to fight this shit too.

1310
01:11:56.150 --> 01:11:59.300
Two fucking years for shooting somebody.
It's pretty fucking good.

1311
01:11:59.301 --> 01:12:03.200
So I just took the deal.
I'm like,
fuck that I can do to,
I'm not,

1312
01:12:03.260 --> 01:12:06.560
what is it like doing two years in the pokey dog?
It's fucking,

1313
01:12:06.610 --> 01:12:10.250
did you see a lot of rape?
Yes.
Really?
Yeah.
What happened?
What'd you say?

1314
01:12:10.340 --> 01:12:14.140
What's that smell?
Just fucking
great.

1315
01:12:15.570 --> 01:12:20.480
Well,
well,
well,
well not like,

1316
01:12:20.481 --> 01:12:24.920
not like,
not like,
not like rate,
but just motherfuckers given up that ass,

1317
01:12:24.921 --> 01:12:29.320
like just,
yeah,
it was just,
it was just accepted.
Like for some motherfuckers,

1318
01:12:29.390 --> 01:12:33.020
like a lot of it is,
I was just thinking,
coming up here,

1319
01:12:33.110 --> 01:12:37.600
I remember playing a game of space,
right?
I was,
I was playing a space game hard.

1320
01:12:37.650 --> 01:12:41.780
Yeah.
Cars phase.
Please let him win at the end of this game.
And then,
no,
no,
no.

1321
01:12:41.781 --> 01:12:44.420
And then,
and then there was a dude sitting to my left,

1322
01:12:44.421 --> 01:12:47.360
like Joe is another dude walked up behind him,
tapped him on the shoulder,

1323
01:12:47.390 --> 01:12:50.450
do got up,
pulled his pants down,
and then it went to his cell.
Cause that,

1324
01:12:50.451 --> 01:12:53.780
cause it's time,
you know what I'm saying?
It's just time for you to get.
Fuck,

1325
01:12:53.930 --> 01:12:56.570
<v 4>Whoa,
Whoa,
whoa.
So the guy comes over taps,
dude,</v>

1326
01:12:56.571 --> 01:12:58.780
you're playing cards to this dude and what does the guy live there is,

1327
01:12:58.781 --> 01:13:03.650
who are you guys like blessing upon?
Nothing crazy.
None of that shit taps him.

1328
01:13:03.651 --> 01:13:06.080
And the guy just pulls his pants down before he starts walking.

1329
01:13:06.830 --> 01:13:09.850
So to let everybody know this is what's going on.
Like he's drowning that.

1330
01:13:09.860 --> 01:13:13.400
I guess it's just the way he do it,
I guess the way,
I guess that was his choice.

1331
01:13:13.401 --> 01:13:15.470
But he just goes in there,
pulls his pants down.

1332
01:13:15.471 --> 01:13:17.000
And the guy who started fucking him in front of everybody.

1333
01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:20.200
<v 7>Well he,
well he went into the cell like he had a,</v>

1334
01:13:20.201 --> 01:13:23.830
he had a cell over there,
but he went into itself,

1335
01:13:24.010 --> 01:13:25.270
<v 4>got done.
So the cells,</v>

1336
01:13:25.271 --> 01:13:29.270
a lot of times the cells are open and everybody's just wandering around.
Fuck.

1337
01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:32.620
Yeah.
So it's like prison.
How much time are you wondering around?

1338
01:13:32.850 --> 01:13:37.470
<v 7>Um,
okay.
You got count like three times.
Well,</v>

1339
01:13:37.471 --> 01:13:39.930
the jails I was in,
we had account four times a day.

1340
01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:44.690
So unless you had somebody do something stupid on what they call it,

1341
01:13:44.691 --> 01:13:47.430
the tier you be out for the rest of that day and sell.

1342
01:13:47.431 --> 01:13:49.410
It was either time to go to lunch,
dinner,

1343
01:13:50.290 --> 01:13:53.170
<v 4>hang out all day.
Yeah.
So basically the jail is like,</v>

1344
01:13:53.171 --> 01:13:56.290
you got a cell and the cells open most of the time and you guys are just

1345
01:13:56.291 --> 01:13:59.440
wandering around playing checkers and doing over the fuck you want tickling each

1346
01:13:59.441 --> 01:14:02.860
sucking dicks.
I was always curious about this and then,
you know,

1347
01:14:02.861 --> 01:14:05.680
family members and I've never been able to ask him exactly like as far as the

1348
01:14:05.681 --> 01:14:06.251
prison rules,

1349
01:14:06.251 --> 01:14:09.070
what's the socially acceptable allotment of time that you gotta be in there

1350
01:14:09.071 --> 01:14:12.040
before?
It's just socially acceptable to start another dude.

1351
01:14:12.190 --> 01:14:13.960
<v 2>Well,
if you go in there for life,
well,</v>

1352
01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:18.720
life,
everything.
We never thought we'd do

1353
01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:22.130
<v 7>like,
uh,
well I can't speak for every jail,</v>

1354
01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:25.010
but all I do know is where did you go to jail?

1355
01:14:25.580 --> 01:14:29.670
I was in jail in DC and then Maryland and then,
uh,

1356
01:14:29.730 --> 01:14:34.180
I was in Baltimore city.
They moved you around?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Wow.
And um,

1357
01:14:34.820 --> 01:14:39.500
I can't speak for every jail.
Why they move you did you do some gangster shit?
No,

1358
01:14:39.501 --> 01:14:44.450
cause it was,
well I actually went to solitary for 45 days for tickling.
No,

1359
01:14:44.451 --> 01:14:46.250
not particular player.
Uh,

1360
01:14:46.540 --> 01:14:51.180
<v 2>cause that's the first time you've ever said that,
that if you take a look,
yeah,</v>

1361
01:14:51.610 --> 01:14:52.540
that's a rare

1362
01:14:55.840 --> 01:15:00.150
combination to
you're now you're taking them player,

1363
01:15:01.990 --> 01:15:06.610
particular player.
Yeah.
That's a very rare statement.
That's a hardcore state.

1364
01:15:06.611 --> 01:15:07.444
We right there.

1365
01:15:07.950 --> 01:15:10.580
<v 7>Oh No.
But okay.</v>

1366
01:15:11.670 --> 01:15:14.820
I went in right and I had some shoes,

1367
01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:17.190
tennis shoes and these dudes,
one of them.

1368
01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:20.100
And I had to fight them every day to keep my fucking shoes.

1369
01:15:20.101 --> 01:15:21.900
And then I got sick of fighting these guys.

1370
01:15:22.260 --> 01:15:26.020
So I had a bright idea that instead of fight,
now I'll just hit the COO.

1371
01:15:26.021 --> 01:15:29.310
So niggas would think that I'm crazy.
Right.
Well I did that.

1372
01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:32.500
And what happened was they got these people called this did,

1373
01:15:32.540 --> 01:15:34.320
they got these cops called the storm troopers.

1374
01:15:34.321 --> 01:15:37.320
Like they'll run into the tear in riot gear if anything break out,

1375
01:15:37.321 --> 01:15:39.960
like full riot gear,
fucking all that shit.

1376
01:15:40.650 --> 01:15:45.480
I hate to see yo and these dudes roll in.
And when I woke up,

1377
01:15:45.481 --> 01:15:49.760
I was in the infirmary.
I had broken ribs,
like they fucked me up.
Damn.

1378
01:15:50.370 --> 01:15:54.990
So when I got out of the infirmary,
they sent me to solitary for 45 days.

1379
01:15:55.220 --> 01:15:57.050
<v 2>You should have asked somebody about that plan.</v>

1380
01:15:57.620 --> 01:16:00.230
Looked to who am I gonna talk to my lonely.

1381
01:16:00.231 --> 01:16:02.690
At first I'm thinking about going crazy and fucking up a cup.

1382
01:16:03.380 --> 01:16:07.460
I didn't have a chance to fuck him up.
I,
I hit that cop one time.

1383
01:16:07.461 --> 01:16:10.520
Just a body shot.
Just some niggas think dog before.

1384
01:16:10.521 --> 01:16:14.700
I think I drew my fish back.
I had like 10 motherfuckers there.
Right.

1385
01:16:15.290 --> 01:16:18.260
Take your shoes after that.
Yeah,
no,
no.

1386
01:16:19.510 --> 01:16:23.120
<v 7>Oh the cops fuck me up.
But people thought I was nuts.
And it's like,</v>

1387
01:16:23.650 --> 01:16:26.240
but the whole,
the whole,
so they leave you alone.

1388
01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:28.700
And then once I,

1389
01:16:28.830 --> 01:16:31.390
<v 2>once you have accomplished the same thing by kicking the shit out of one of the</v>

1390
01:16:31.391 --> 01:16:33.930
guys who took your sneakers.
Not every day.
No,
no.
Nobody.

1391
01:16:33.931 --> 01:16:36.510
You would just poop on my shoes.
I didn't know one would want,
it doesn't work.

1392
01:16:36.690 --> 01:16:39.130
Brian like doesn't work in advance.
I like to wait.

1393
01:16:39.131 --> 01:16:43.230
You know it doesn't work when you're on ship them off.
They'll just clean it.

1394
01:16:43.250 --> 01:16:45.360
You're in jail.
You aren't here though.

1395
01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:50.210
It's like it's a whole different menu.
They'll just clean them off.
Big Deal.

1396
01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:54.890
Yeah.
The clean that shit out fucking s like rub it into the inside of Martin.

1397
01:16:55.420 --> 01:16:57.620
Cause of cause of my balls on the outside.

1398
01:17:00.550 --> 01:17:01.950
No,
it always kills me.

1399
01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:03.850
<v 7>He is,
whenever somebody saying how they,</v>

1400
01:17:03.890 --> 01:17:07.130
how they would survive in jail is always wrong.

1401
01:17:07.900 --> 01:17:10.100
<v 2>It's Paul Ryan has a way to get away from</v>

1402
01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:10.480
<v 4>rape.</v>

1403
01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:13.000
<v 8>Yeah.
Brian.
Yeah.
Some guys trying to make me suck his dick.</v>

1404
01:17:13.001 --> 01:17:16.540
I'll just grab his balls and run as fast as I can in the opposite direction.

1405
01:17:16.650 --> 01:17:20.890
The brick off the bucking balls off.
Feels like he can dig my nails in there.

1406
01:17:21.180 --> 01:17:23.300
Grab a thing or two and just fucking power.

1407
01:17:23.310 --> 01:17:25.780
Where are you going to go when you run away?
Huh?

1408
01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:28.990
I'm going to be ripping his balls and wearing it as a mess down the fucking

1409
01:17:28.991 --> 01:17:29.780
whatever it's called.

1410
01:17:29.780 --> 01:17:34.780
The stairway and tomorrow I will have that mask on my head still and no one will

1411
01:17:35.261 --> 01:17:36.630
fuck with me cause I'll rip your balls off.

1412
01:17:36.631 --> 01:17:41.020
But there's tomorrow mask and guess what guys starts in front of me,

1413
01:17:41.021 --> 01:17:41.430
I'll take it.

1414
01:17:41.430 --> 01:17:43.050
<v 4>There's no happy end of this conversation</v>

1415
01:17:44.670 --> 01:17:48.960
for our listeners right now are hemorrhaging.
They're in the car.

1416
01:17:49.890 --> 01:17:54.060
Shot him the fuck up.
I swear to God,

1417
01:17:54.061 --> 01:17:56.640
I'll unsubscribe to this fucking stupid podcast.

1418
01:17:57.300 --> 01:18:00.180
This ridiculous by hurting fucked here.
This ridiculous idea.

1419
01:18:00.210 --> 01:18:02.160
Nobody's [inaudible] podcasts ago.

1420
01:18:05.780 --> 01:18:10.110
It's still just as good as this is idea.
It's look what he's going to do.

1421
01:18:10.111 --> 01:18:13.470
It's his plan.
God bless you.
But you never know man.
You might have a killer grip.

1422
01:18:13.500 --> 01:18:15.840
I did.
Some dudes have a grip.
It's very shocking.

1423
01:18:15.841 --> 01:18:18.720
Every now and then like you do Jujitsu with the guy grabs your wrist and go,

1424
01:18:18.721 --> 01:18:22.220
God damn,
this motherfucker's got a grip.
You know it can't even fuck

1425
01:18:24.350 --> 01:18:26.500
some guys.
Some guys can hold on to your man Brian.

1426
01:18:26.510 --> 01:18:31.510
Maybe may Brian's got that kind of grip.
I hope so.
Cause that shit.

1427
01:18:32.010 --> 01:18:35.650
Well listen,
at least he's got a plan plan plan.

1428
01:18:36.830 --> 01:18:41.750
No one else.
No one a much better plan is don't fucking go to jail.
I was like,

1429
01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:44.700
the absence heath is this Japanese nuclear power plant?

1430
01:18:44.701 --> 01:18:48.660
Is that the worst plan that human beings have ever made as far as like plans

1431
01:18:48.661 --> 01:18:52.570
that didn't work out,
plans that were chuge disaster here.

1432
01:18:52.571 --> 01:18:54.600
Is there a single worst plan?

1433
01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:59.720
Then building a nuclear reactor on a fucking a monkey making aids.

1434
01:18:59.970 --> 01:19:01.230
I don't think that's how it's happened,

1435
01:19:01.250 --> 01:19:04.740
but I don't think I'd be really fucked him.
Uncle Sam Kinison,

1436
01:19:06.300 --> 01:19:09.990
did they actually know that that shit was on a fault line?
Oh,
for sure.

1437
01:19:09.991 --> 01:19:14.970
So he built it to last to take it up to an 8.2 they thought that was pretty

1438
01:19:14.971 --> 01:19:17.290
generous.
You know,
that's kind of extravagant earthquake.

1439
01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:20.810
They got a fucking nine after yesterday's podcasts.

1440
01:19:20.811 --> 01:19:23.640
A lot of people are saying that it's not as bad in Japan as everyone is saying.

1441
01:19:23.670 --> 01:19:25.080
That's nonsense.
That's not true at all.

1442
01:19:25.170 --> 01:19:28.890
They've just updated it to Chernobyl status.
They've just,
it's bad.

1443
01:19:30.210 --> 01:19:33.240
Here's the thing about it being bad.
It's not getting better.
Okay.

1444
01:19:33.360 --> 01:19:36.810
It's getting better maybe in a hundred thousand years and it's getting more and

1445
01:19:36.811 --> 01:19:40.290
more fucked up and more and more nuclear materials is leaking.

1446
01:19:40.380 --> 01:19:43.920
The reason why the it keeps getting worse and now it's level seven Chernobyl

1447
01:19:43.921 --> 01:19:46.980
levels is because it's getting worse.
It's not.
It's like,

1448
01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:49.440
well it's going to get to a certain point then it's just going to stop.

1449
01:19:49.460 --> 01:19:54.300
Oh this is a bad situation.
It's bad.
And in Japan,
Japan is not big man.

1450
01:19:54.330 --> 01:19:55.163
It's not big.

1451
01:19:55.230 --> 01:19:59.040
It's not like this shit is happening in Nebraska and you're living in Alaska and

1452
01:19:59.041 --> 01:20:02.610
it never really hits,
you know,
this is Japan is fucking tiny man.

1453
01:20:02.611 --> 01:20:05.550
It's just so nice place.
So let me take a wild guess.

1454
01:20:05.610 --> 01:20:08.100
They built it on a fault because the land was cheap

1455
01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:11.760
<v 1>or whatever.
So they decided to build all of Japan prime.
I mean,</v>

1456
01:20:11.761 --> 01:20:14.280
Japan is an island,
you know,
and it's not that big.

1457
01:20:14.310 --> 01:20:17.160
So there's a lot of spots in Japan where the fucking ground moves.

1458
01:20:17.161 --> 01:20:17.901
Like what are you gonna do?

1459
01:20:17.901 --> 01:20:19.730
You can just going to hope that you've got it figured,

1460
01:20:19.740 --> 01:20:22.110
figured out where it doesn't go bad if the ground moves.

1461
01:20:22.290 --> 01:20:25.950
But they never knew the ground was going to go to a nine I mean nine for five

1462
01:20:25.951 --> 01:20:26.581
minutes.
I mean,

1463
01:20:26.581 --> 01:20:30.510
it just broke everything and then the tsunami came in and killed the generators

1464
01:20:30.511 --> 01:20:33.180
and they couldn't cool the look the rods down and cut a break there.

1465
01:20:33.181 --> 01:20:36.240
Did they just no.
Yeah,
but they didn't plan it out.
Well,

1466
01:20:36.241 --> 01:20:39.010
it's like one of the worst plans ever.
We're going to create an a,

1467
01:20:39.011 --> 01:20:43.260
a some sort of a reactor that harnesses the power of the fucking Sun,

1468
01:20:43.620 --> 01:20:47.570
but we don't know how to shut it off.
Just in case we don't know.

1469
01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:49.710
We don't know what happens if the power goes out of the power.

1470
01:20:49.711 --> 01:20:52.170
We're good for about eight hours.
The power goes out.

1471
01:20:52.171 --> 01:20:56.550
They had battery backup for eight hours.
Does that?
Yeah.
So in those eight hours,

1472
01:20:56.551 --> 01:20:59.220
you got a fucking,
okay,
how,

1473
01:20:59.790 --> 01:21:04.560
how fucking greedy are these motherfuckers like nobody.
Nobody thought like,
Hey,

1474
01:21:04.950 --> 01:21:07.410
it's not possible for acceptable risks.

1475
01:21:07.411 --> 01:21:10.380
They were willing to take what they felt were acceptable risks and the

1476
01:21:10.381 --> 01:21:12.480
acceptable risk just really aren't that planned out.

1477
01:21:12.650 --> 01:21:14.850
It's human beings have such a narrow,

1478
01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:19.770
we have such a narrow window of reference because our lives are only 30 40 50

1479
01:21:19.771 --> 01:21:21.300
years.
By the time we're making these choices,

1480
01:21:21.450 --> 01:21:24.270
you don't learn that much in those 50 years.
You don't,
you just don't.

1481
01:21:24.450 --> 01:21:27.640
And then when you add those 50 years to all of the fucking,
the,
the,

1482
01:21:27.641 --> 01:21:31.440
the previous people that have lived to be 50 60 years old in human history and

1483
01:21:31.441 --> 01:21:34.110
all they figured out and you're at the forefront of it and you've created this

1484
01:21:34.111 --> 01:21:36.900
new thing called nuclear power and you're the guy who's like,
you know,

1485
01:21:36.901 --> 01:21:38.820
people are listening to Neil,
like,
how do we do this?
Well,

1486
01:21:38.821 --> 01:21:40.850
this is what we do when we got this thing and it cools the rods.

1487
01:21:41.250 --> 01:21:43.560
What happens when it goes off?
Well,
don't worry.
We've got fail safes.

1488
01:21:43.561 --> 01:21:46.770
Everything's got be fine.
Okay,
this guy says it's good.
Let's go with him.
Well,

1489
01:21:46.771 --> 01:21:47.910
he's a clueless fuck.

1490
01:21:48.030 --> 01:21:51.330
Just like were all clueless flux interrupt for about what one human lifetime.

1491
01:21:51.960 --> 01:21:54.840
We don't have enough fucking nuclear power.
Is Clean,

1492
01:21:54.841 --> 01:21:58.290
safe energy sometimes yes,
sometimes.

1493
01:21:58.440 --> 01:22:00.300
And sometimes he eats a whole through the earth.

1494
01:22:00.600 --> 01:22:04.230
And kills everything within a hundred miles,
you know?
Yeah.
Sometimes it's fucked.

1495
01:22:04.410 --> 01:22:08.850
I hate to sound like a dick head,
but like how does that affect us?

1496
01:22:09.290 --> 01:22:12.390
Effects us very badly because first of all,
there's,
there's power,

1497
01:22:12.420 --> 01:22:15.780
there's nuclear reactors in Orange County and they're on fault lines and

1498
01:22:15.781 --> 01:22:19.410
anything over an 8.2 shit gets very tricky and you don't know what the fuck

1499
01:22:19.411 --> 01:22:23.490
happens if they have a big 8.2 down in fucking the oh saying and that nuclear

1500
01:22:23.491 --> 01:22:24.930
power plant gets fucked in,

1501
01:22:24.931 --> 01:22:27.780
the power can't come back on and they can't cool the rods and it just,

1502
01:22:27.960 --> 01:22:32.480
and it goes into a meltdown.
Well,
we're fucked.
Mexico's Fox.

1503
01:22:32.481 --> 01:22:36.060
San Diego's fucked.
Everyone's fucked.
You know,
the,
these,

1504
01:22:36.061 --> 01:22:38.970
these guys that are doing this in Japan,
they don't know how to shut this off.

1505
01:22:39.090 --> 01:22:42.030
And they've got engineers that are willing to risk their lives going in there

1506
01:22:42.031 --> 01:22:43.080
trying to shut things down.

1507
01:22:43.170 --> 01:22:46.800
There's over 50 guys have gone in there knowing for sure that it's a death

1508
01:22:46.801 --> 01:22:49.530
sentence,
knowing for sure that they're going to get cancer,

1509
01:22:49.531 --> 01:22:52.650
they're going to die horrible,
terrible deaths because of radiation exposure.

1510
01:22:52.680 --> 01:22:55.200
And they're still doing it.
They're still doing it.
They took chances.

1511
01:22:55.350 --> 01:22:57.360
They went there until they couldn't take it anymore and then they went to the

1512
01:22:57.361 --> 01:23:00.570
hospital for radiation poisoning and they're fucked and he's got until it's

1513
01:23:00.580 --> 01:23:03.580
going to get 100% death.
Wish it.
Guess what?
They wouldn't do that in America.
No,

1514
01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:06.100
I was going to do that here.
They ain't have no take that Honda

1515
01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:09.550
<v 5>robot and make him do whatever the has to be done on the robots or retard,
bro.</v>

1516
01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:12.130
You can't do shit.
He's good at like he plays basketball,

1517
01:23:13.960 --> 01:23:17.420
can't get him to fucking join rods and pull rocks out and robot

1518
01:23:18.570 --> 01:23:20.610
<v 1>bunch of robots.
Well they don't really play basketball.</v>

1519
01:23:20.611 --> 01:23:22.230
They have different things that they do.
Like one of them,

1520
01:23:22.350 --> 01:23:23.400
if you see any dribble a ball,

1521
01:23:23.950 --> 01:23:24.820
<v 5>I think they get dance.</v>

1522
01:23:24.821 --> 01:23:27.140
I can think of they could do everything and then they could throw the armature

1523
01:23:27.141 --> 01:23:31.840
on.
Obviously it's a programmed like if that fucker can dance,

1524
01:23:31.841 --> 01:23:36.841
send them down there your way down there to make it more positive eventually.

1525
01:23:37.030 --> 01:23:38.770
<v 1>That's no doubt that's going to happen.</v>

1526
01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:41.140
Eventually there's going to be a robot that can do every single thing,

1527
01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:44.530
any movement in articulation that a human being can.
Because look,

1528
01:23:44.531 --> 01:23:45.820
we know how human works.

1529
01:23:46.210 --> 01:23:47.370
<v 5>I'm scared of that type of shit.</v>

1530
01:23:47.371 --> 01:23:51.260
Hopefully that type of shit scares and that some terminator robots.
Yeah.
Not,

1531
01:23:51.780 --> 01:23:53.040
not necessarily robots.

1532
01:23:53.100 --> 01:23:57.660
It's just getting to the point where I'm that dependent on a robot.

1533
01:23:57.690 --> 01:24:00.990
You know what I'm saying?
Because I know,
I know that I'm lazy.

1534
01:24:01.020 --> 01:24:04.530
So if I had a robot to do that shit,
I would do it.
Fuck,
you know,

1535
01:24:04.730 --> 01:24:06.630
like do that and do that and do that.

1536
01:24:06.631 --> 01:24:09.610
And then it turns out I'm not doing shit no more like,
yeah.

1537
01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:13.950
Basically I have a wind.
Makes you think you would do that?
Cause I'm,

1538
01:24:14.180 --> 01:24:18.050
cause I'm fucking lazy.
But believe me,
man,
robots are expensive.

1539
01:24:18.580 --> 01:24:20.010
It's going to be hard to get that robot.

1540
01:24:20.040 --> 01:24:23.190
It's not going to be using in your lifetime.

1541
01:24:23.191 --> 01:24:26.700
Robots are never going to be cheap at the time.
A robots cheap,
you'll be dead

1542
01:24:28.470 --> 01:24:29.670
<v 1>downloaded into a robot.</v>

1543
01:24:29.700 --> 01:24:33.930
It'll be like that movies one little downloaded into a robot.

1544
01:24:34.140 --> 01:24:37.830
There's a movie that's out right now.
Uh,
trends,
trends and dent.

1545
01:24:37.890 --> 01:24:40.350
No transcendent man.
Yeah.
Transcendent man,

1546
01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:44.880
the Ray cartwheel documentary and it's out right now on iTunes.
Yeah.

1547
01:24:44.910 --> 01:24:48.210
Transcendent man.
I,
I watched half of it today before the podcast.

1548
01:24:48.211 --> 01:24:51.270
I'm going to watch the rest of it later.
It's fascinating shit.
And Rake Kurt's,

1549
01:24:51.271 --> 01:24:53.310
we'll is this super genius who's,

1550
01:24:53.730 --> 01:24:58.050
he's made a bunch of different inventions and he's like,
you know,

1551
01:24:58.051 --> 01:25:03.051
at the forefront of the idea of the exponential growth of technology eventually

1552
01:25:03.991 --> 01:25:07.290
coming to a point where there's some sort of a singularity and artificial

1553
01:25:07.291 --> 01:25:10.590
intelligence and uh,
potential,
uh,

1554
01:25:10.920 --> 01:25:15.900
like potential download of the human consciousness into computers will,

1555
01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:19.410
you will live forever as long as the power stays on,
as long as you know,

1556
01:25:19.411 --> 01:25:22.470
you can figure out a way to have a power source that is,
well,

1557
01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:25.380
that is a bit much for me,
man.
It's,
it's a bit much,

1558
01:25:25.381 --> 01:25:26.790
but it's fascinating because it's all about,

1559
01:25:26.791 --> 01:25:29.880
first of all it's about nanotechnology and the idea of these little tiny

1560
01:25:29.881 --> 01:25:33.870
computers that are going to be the size of a cell of blood,
a blood cell,

1561
01:25:34.020 --> 01:25:36.750
and they're going to be in your bloodstream repairing things.

1562
01:25:36.751 --> 01:25:38.540
And fixing cancer and doing all kinds of,

1563
01:25:39.650 --> 01:25:42.010
<v 5>that's awesome.
Chefs this carry shit,</v>

1564
01:25:42.011 --> 01:25:47.011
that type of shit that only a comedy comedy would have ever heard about this

1565
01:25:47.171 --> 01:25:51.910
shit cause I'm telling you as far as building my mind and expanding that shit.

1566
01:25:51.970 --> 01:25:56.020
Oh you don't hear about this shit when you're on the corner and in DC fucking

1567
01:25:56.021 --> 01:25:59.020
slinging crack is like a cubicle.
It's fucking man.

1568
01:25:59.021 --> 01:26:01.930
Oh technology and shit like that.
Like oh yeah.

1569
01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:04.160
A lot of people don't hear about stuff until the hear about

1570
01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:06.560
<v 1>it on Twitter or they hear about it on Facebook or they hear about on this</v>

1571
01:26:06.561 --> 01:26:08.780
podcast and I hear about a lot of this shit.

1572
01:26:08.781 --> 01:26:10.100
A lot of the things that I hear about,

1573
01:26:10.250 --> 01:26:12.110
like I found out the transcendent man was out.

1574
01:26:12.140 --> 01:26:15.320
I knew it was coming out on DVD but I thought it was like in a few months.

1575
01:26:15.500 --> 01:26:18.680
But it came out on iTunes first and the only reason I found out is somebody put

1576
01:26:18.681 --> 01:26:22.640
it up on Twitter.
I mean it's,
and I find out so much on Twitter,

1577
01:26:22.641 --> 01:26:25.540
so many different weird fucking interesting stories.
Welcome

1578
01:26:25.940 --> 01:26:29.780
<v 7>cause I like follow you on Twitter and you'll be posting some shit and I'll go</v>

1579
01:26:29.781 --> 01:26:32.180
to it.
And I'm like,
what in the hell?
It's like Yo,

1580
01:26:32.510 --> 01:26:36.530
like you'll post stories that ain't nobody would even think of.

1581
01:26:36.531 --> 01:26:40.640
And I'm just like,
what the fuck?
Just just from the hour we'd check it out.

1582
01:26:40.641 --> 01:26:44.090
But it's like,
oh,
that's a bit much.
As far as nano technology and shit like that.

1583
01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:45.710
<v 1>Well it's,
it's what it is,</v>

1584
01:26:45.711 --> 01:26:49.640
is that computers are eventually gonna get stronger and stronger and smaller and

1585
01:26:49.641 --> 01:26:50.001
smaller.

1586
01:26:50.001 --> 01:26:52.580
I mean that's just the trend they've always done and they're going to be able to

1587
01:26:52.581 --> 01:26:53.690
do more and more and more.

1588
01:26:53.691 --> 01:26:56.100
And eventually what they're going to be able to do is you're gonna be able to

1589
01:26:56.101 --> 01:27:00.650
figure out what are the components of a human being and how can we reproduce

1590
01:27:00.651 --> 01:27:03.110
that because they can make artificial flesh already.

1591
01:27:03.111 --> 01:27:05.450
They've already figured out a way to make artificial ham.

1592
01:27:05.660 --> 01:27:07.310
They've figured out a way to make artificial like,

1593
01:27:07.311 --> 01:27:11.630
but they've grown ears on rats ever seen that grow a human ear on a mouse as

1594
01:27:11.631 --> 01:27:13.450
body.
They haven't done a human.
Yeah.

1595
01:27:13.460 --> 01:27:18.320
They know how to do so much that eventually it's going to get better and as it

1596
01:27:18.321 --> 01:27:21.830
gets better,
it's going to be an artificial human beings do all those things.

1597
01:27:21.831 --> 01:27:24.320
They did that go was a goat or a lamb or something in Japan.

1598
01:27:24.321 --> 01:27:27.350
They had that Dolly the sheep.
They cloned it,

1599
01:27:27.351 --> 01:27:29.810
but that's not an artificial duplicate.

1600
01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:31.400
<v 7>If they can do all of that,</v>

1601
01:27:32.060 --> 01:27:35.210
then why the fuck is there still a skid row?

1602
01:27:36.220 --> 01:27:38.260
<v 1>Well,
here's the thing,
you can do all that.</v>

1603
01:27:39.550 --> 01:27:43.450
You can't fix a human's development.
Once it's developed,

1604
01:27:43.630 --> 01:27:47.260
that's when it's a real,
it's like fixing a dog that's already fucking crazy.

1605
01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:52.690
You know,
you got a dog started attacking babies and fucking bites cars and shit,

1606
01:27:52.930 --> 01:27:54.340
man,
try fixing that dog.

1607
01:27:54.630 --> 01:27:58.300
But to keep that dog from becoming that dog that you can do.

1608
01:27:58.360 --> 01:28:01.570
If you treat the dog with love and respect and you train them and you train him

1609
01:28:01.571 --> 01:28:03.850
that he's your buddy and you know,
then you've got a happy dog.

1610
01:28:03.851 --> 01:28:06.670
When he meets people,
they'll associate people with being happy.
You know,

1611
01:28:06.671 --> 01:28:08.360
it'll be like a positive experience do.

1612
01:28:08.361 --> 01:28:11.170
You don't have to worry about retraining them.
It's retraining people.

1613
01:28:11.171 --> 01:28:14.100
That's hard.
So you get to skid row,
they're already fuck.

1614
01:28:14.290 --> 01:28:18.820
<v 7>So then would you consider somebody like me an exception to that rule that you</v>

1615
01:28:18.821 --> 01:28:19.654
just made?

1616
01:28:19.700 --> 01:28:21.260
<v 1>Well me,
I'm accepted to it too.</v>

1617
01:28:21.261 --> 01:28:23.990
I wasn't a perfect human being when I was a child.
I was fucking crazy.

1618
01:28:24.170 --> 01:28:27.530
I was crazy through most of my,
my young twenties you know,

1619
01:28:27.531 --> 01:28:30.800
like legitimately crazy.
You know?
And if you,
if you know,

1620
01:28:30.801 --> 01:28:34.160
you look at who you are now and who you used to be and there's evolution,

1621
01:28:34.161 --> 01:28:37.370
but it has to be from yourself.
You have to decide to do it on your own.

1622
01:28:37.371 --> 01:28:39.560
It's very difficult.
You gotta be objective.

1623
01:28:39.590 --> 01:28:40.850
You're going to have to probably do drugs.

1624
01:28:40.851 --> 01:28:43.330
You're gonna have to find yourself for real need.

1625
01:28:44.550 --> 01:28:46.040
We won't really get there on your own.

1626
01:28:47.300 --> 01:28:50.090
<v 7>Well,
I beg to differ a little bit.</v>

1627
01:28:50.091 --> 01:28:55.091
I think that's what me being in isolation did for me when I was in jail.

1628
01:28:55.920 --> 01:29:00.560
Makes Sense.
Because it's not like dog,
like you have to think.
You have to,

1629
01:29:00.561 --> 01:29:05.010
I mean after you,
after you blame the lawyers and God and your parents,

1630
01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:06.780
you still got 43 days left.

1631
01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:10.160
<v 1>So you get analyze yourself.
Here's the deal,
man,
here's the deal.
You live,</v>

1632
01:29:10.161 --> 01:29:14.390
you can blame everybody for your problems in life,
but you might be right,

1633
01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:16.780
but you can't change that,
right?

1634
01:29:16.790 --> 01:29:21.790
What you can change is what you think and how you react and what power you give

1635
01:29:22.100 --> 01:29:26.720
other people's actions and thoughts over you right now from getting pissed off

1636
01:29:26.721 --> 01:29:29.150
with them.
By using that energy for yourself,

1637
01:29:29.151 --> 01:29:33.200
using that energy for positive shit and using that energy to try to accomplish
it

1638
01:29:33.260 --> 01:29:34.220
<v 7>like that can either,</v>

1639
01:29:34.250 --> 01:29:38.400
that could either drive you crazy or it could make you a better person.

1640
01:29:38.840 --> 01:29:40.520
And that's why,
you know,

1641
01:29:40.970 --> 01:29:45.740
I know that I brought a lot of shit on myself,
but I'm glad that I was used,

1642
01:29:45.810 --> 01:29:49.490
able to use the time that I was in jail to say,
dog,

1643
01:29:49.520 --> 01:29:51.500
you can't keep doing this dumb shit,
man.

1644
01:29:51.501 --> 01:29:54.500
You have to try to do something and be it.
Be at calm.

1645
01:29:54.501 --> 01:29:59.180
And the reason that I even bothered to think that I could be a comic is cause

1646
01:29:59.181 --> 01:30:02.690
that was one of my survival while I was in jail.
I've always been this size.

1647
01:30:03.170 --> 01:30:06.680
So I was the guy that if somebody did something or said something,

1648
01:30:06.681 --> 01:30:10.040
I have something quick to say.
They kept brava smiling.

1649
01:30:10.130 --> 01:30:12.680
Cause though that's a long time to be anywhere.

1650
01:30:12.950 --> 01:30:17.420
So just a smile for that one day or,
or,
or like a laugh.

1651
01:30:17.630 --> 01:30:18.710
Especially in jail.

1652
01:30:18.730 --> 01:30:22.730
It means a whole lot more than just us talking and laughing here because dog,

1653
01:30:22.760 --> 01:30:25.760
it's a miserable existence.
It really is.
No,

1654
01:30:27.530 --> 01:30:30.410
not to say that I didn't deserve to be there,
but uh,

1655
01:30:30.590 --> 01:30:33.730
it's for eight fucking sucks.
It's like don't let rappers fool you.

1656
01:30:33.731 --> 01:30:35.690
That shit sucks man.
It's nothing.

1657
01:30:35.990 --> 01:30:39.980
It's nothing hard about doing something stupid and winding up in jail is fucking

1658
01:30:39.981 --> 01:30:44.980
dumb.
It's really stupid to do something to wind up in jail and it's,

1659
01:30:45.020 --> 01:30:46.760
it's just fucking awful.
So

1660
01:30:46.950 --> 01:30:49.170
<v 1>Joey Diaz has the same story then when he was in jail,</v>

1661
01:30:49.171 --> 01:30:51.990
making people laugh in jails where it got him into being a standup comedian.

1662
01:30:52.050 --> 01:30:54.710
But he would have,
they would have like show movies,
something to move with soc.

1663
01:30:54.740 --> 01:30:57.450
They'd say,
coco get up there,
get up there and tell stories.

1664
01:30:57.630 --> 01:30:59.700
And he would get up there and he'd start making everybody laugh.

1665
01:30:59.701 --> 01:31:02.850
And that's like what started him off on the road to being a comic.

1666
01:31:02.940 --> 01:31:07.380
<v 7>Oh see I,
but then,
then the other part of it,
I also stuttered.</v>

1667
01:31:07.920 --> 01:31:11.670
So what would happen is he,
like if I said something that was slick,

1668
01:31:11.671 --> 01:31:15.000
people would laugh and sometimes I would try to talk and stutter and people

1669
01:31:15.001 --> 01:31:18.540
would laugh.
So either way I'm cool.
You know,
I say so.

1670
01:31:18.930 --> 01:31:22.590
But with that we were just that laughter man.

1671
01:31:22.591 --> 01:31:26.610
Like laughter is something that I think that we as comic shouldn't take for

1672
01:31:26.611 --> 01:31:28.500
granted.
It's a powerful thing.
Like if it,

1673
01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:33.420
if it can help somebody get through jail,
like la just laughing once a day.

1674
01:31:33.860 --> 01:31:35.000
<v 1>No,
it's just very powerful.</v>

1675
01:31:35.060 --> 01:31:37.560
It's a very powerful thing and I don't think about it cause it's,

1676
01:31:37.610 --> 01:31:40.310
it seems frivolous,
it seems like,
oh you just laughing.
You're silly.

1677
01:31:40.311 --> 01:31:43.400
You're a silly person.
Oh,
it's important for your health.

1678
01:31:43.960 --> 01:31:47.800
<v 7>It really mental health also.
It's like,
oh,
some,
some shit.</v>

1679
01:31:47.920 --> 01:31:52.600
Just fucking let it ride,
man.
Let it ride.
And even with,

1680
01:31:53.530 --> 01:31:58.450
even with,
um,
what I'm doing as far as comedy,
man,

1681
01:31:58.451 --> 01:32:02.640
it's like dog.
It's really cool to make people laugh.
Like I've,

1682
01:32:02.710 --> 01:32:05.470
I've gotten to that point.
I've been angry dude.

1683
01:32:05.471 --> 01:32:09.460
But now it's really cool to make people laugh,
man.
It's really fucking

1684
01:32:09.520 --> 01:32:12.310
<v 2>cool.
Well,
you're pushing positive instead of negative,
you know,</v>

1685
01:32:12.380 --> 01:32:15.560
that's what it is when you have to find some shitty things in your life to

1686
01:32:15.561 --> 01:32:17.000
figure out what you don't want to be doing.

1687
01:32:17.030 --> 01:32:18.980
Learn from your mistakes and then you move on.

1688
01:32:19.110 --> 01:32:21.930
<v 7>Yeah.
And just like,
just like,
uh,
for instance,</v>

1689
01:32:21.960 --> 01:32:25.530
and something else with being in solitary confinement is,

1690
01:32:26.630 --> 01:32:31.630
I'm not as concerned with what goes on around me as far as which,

1691
01:32:31.830 --> 01:32:34.290
which was that first statement that I was making as far as racism.

1692
01:32:34.291 --> 01:32:39.180
But we had to clear that up.
I don't care.
I am a country music fan.

1693
01:32:39.450 --> 01:32:44.130
I like country music.
I love probably because I'm a drinker first,
but I like,

1694
01:32:44.940 --> 01:32:49.290
I like coaching me.
I don't even know why I like it.
I like Dwight Yoakam.

1695
01:32:50.040 --> 01:32:53.430
I like a lot.
Mostly all of it man.

1696
01:32:53.431 --> 01:32:57.120
Like other than that country pop shit where you,
where you got pop stars.

1697
01:32:57.121 --> 01:32:59.940
They couldn't make it as pop.
So they tried to do country.

1698
01:32:59.941 --> 01:33:03.270
Now I think that's a little bit much.
But other than that,
like straight country.

1699
01:33:03.271 --> 01:33:03.820
I love it

1700
01:33:03.820 --> 01:33:05.470
<v 2>man.
Well I'm a big Johnny Cash fan,</v>

1701
01:33:05.471 --> 01:33:07.630
but I never even think of Johnny Cash is being country.

1702
01:33:07.631 --> 01:33:11.440
Johnny Cash is like some weird white rap.
I said that Johnny Cash Fan.

1703
01:33:11.441 --> 01:33:16.060
I wouldn't say I'm a country music fan
boy named sue.

1704
01:33:16.061 --> 01:33:19.010
That song,
man,
that's sad.
It's not really a country music song man.

1705
01:33:25.320 --> 01:33:27.160
Get Away with that back though.

1706
01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:31.930
Cut off a piece of my ear and he said he has a fucking,

1707
01:33:32.070 --> 01:33:36.190
it was a song about a knife fight with his dad was his dad cuts off a piece of

1708
01:33:36.191 --> 01:33:40.900
his ear.
It was written by one,
his name Shel Silverstein.
That poet.
Really,

1709
01:33:40.980 --> 01:33:45.080
man,
he didn't write that.
It's like his song.
He made it his Silverstein.

1710
01:33:45.990 --> 01:33:48.370
I have to respect Shel Silverstein.
I'm still stolen,

1711
01:33:48.371 --> 01:33:50.340
but I've noticed that you say the word dog alive.

1712
01:33:50.380 --> 01:33:52.150
Is that something you've been doing your whole life for it?

1713
01:33:52.210 --> 01:33:55.440
Cause I mean Brian is block.
I know,
but I,
I've never,

1714
01:33:55.510 --> 01:33:59.920
I don't have a word like that.
I guess you need to get one son.
That's my word.

1715
01:34:00.010 --> 01:34:04.600
I need to get a word.
You'll cat cat.
I can say cat.

1716
01:34:05.190 --> 01:34:08.430
<v 7>Hey Kat.
No,
I guess it's a DC thing too.</v>

1717
01:34:08.710 --> 01:34:13.710
<v 2>We like that Stephens is the d set that and like that like player player play</v>

1718
01:34:14.030 --> 01:34:16.300
is.
That might've been one of the funniest things that's ever been said on the

1719
01:34:16.301 --> 01:34:17.920
podcast.
Not For tickle employer.

1720
01:34:20.900 --> 01:34:25.080
That might've been,
it might've been one of the top lines.
Sure.
Out of that.

1721
01:34:25.090 --> 01:34:28.800
Cause I would get lost and
there's a,

1722
01:34:28.810 --> 01:34:32.280
if there's a demand we might have to start doing podcasts,
quote,
tee shirts.

1723
01:34:32.281 --> 01:34:33.160
And that's a pretty good one.

1724
01:34:33.470 --> 01:34:37.060
Particularly for the one with you that on the Wikipedia too though.

1725
01:34:37.420 --> 01:34:38.253
I'm on my man.

1726
01:34:38.260 --> 01:34:41.440
Oh there's already 10 entries in the Wikipedia were put people put that in.

1727
01:34:42.010 --> 01:34:44.050
Of course I'm on some man.
Shit,

1728
01:34:45.250 --> 01:34:47.950
<v 7>what dog?
That's how I like see you as,</v>

1729
01:34:47.951 --> 01:34:52.480
because you know the only way comics is basically like dealing with females for

1730
01:34:52.481 --> 01:34:55.990
the strippers,
strippers,
so like,

1731
01:34:55.991 --> 01:34:59.000
so like talking to Joe is cool because that's what I call it.

1732
01:34:59.001 --> 01:35:03.260
Like Joe is on some mass yet so we can just talk as two men without me having to

1733
01:35:03.261 --> 01:35:07.200
worry about hurting his feelings or saying something that now you in a corner of

1734
01:35:07.201 --> 01:35:11.660
fucking crying or some shit like that.
So it's like,
that's why I say it's a man.

1735
01:35:11.661 --> 01:35:14.410
Shit.
It's like dog.
It's just two men fucking compensating.

1736
01:35:14.450 --> 01:35:15.280
You know what I'm saying?

1737
01:35:15.280 --> 01:35:16.380
<v 1>Proceeding.
I love that word.</v>

1738
01:35:19.250 --> 01:35:22.110
And you hear that crackling in the background.
What the fuck is that?

1739
01:35:22.410 --> 01:35:25.800
That is the volcano.
The sound was the,

1740
01:35:26.800 --> 01:35:28.720
<v 2>that's the compressor.
The crackling.</v>

1741
01:35:28.930 --> 01:35:33.310
The crackling is the plastic bag that contains the pure THC myth.

1742
01:35:34.600 --> 01:35:37.870
People actually wrote that on his witness down.
He's,

1743
01:35:38.960 --> 01:35:43.960
that's the exhale people wrote down your wake up that people wrote it like 10

1744
01:35:44.381 --> 01:35:48.190
times.
Man.
How'd he wrote on his?
I want some man.
Shit.

1745
01:35:48.980 --> 01:35:52.700
I'm all right.
Good.
Don't be scared.

1746
01:35:53.410 --> 01:35:56.910
I guess that means I had it.
Come on man.
This is the home stretch.
Okay.
Fuck it.

1747
01:35:56.930 --> 01:35:59.580
You know what I'm talking about?
That's what I'm talking about,
dude.

1748
01:35:59.610 --> 01:36:02.290
Just push it in and take a deep breath.

1749
01:36:04.180 --> 01:36:06.400
Take a deep breath.
Deep breath and then blow it out.

1750
01:36:06.401 --> 01:36:10.390
That's what I'm talking about,
dog.
You'd probably be good with one.

1751
01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:12.070
Keep you at one.

1752
01:36:12.190 --> 01:36:15.580
We don't want him to get to going crazy here and trying to call it.
That is what?

1753
01:36:15.590 --> 01:36:19.670
A podcast right there.
All right.
Do you want anybody?
Ooh,
trying to claw the,

1754
01:36:20.020 --> 01:36:23.020
the walls up so you know Tony Woods.
Cause you were a DC guy.

1755
01:36:23.930 --> 01:36:28.590
<v 7>No,
he was.
Tony did.
Tony is a funny guy.
He is incredible.
Tom Woods out there.</v>

1756
01:36:28.591 --> 01:36:31.070
Holler at me if you're ever in La.
I love to have you on the podcast.

1757
01:36:31.071 --> 01:36:34.320
Tony is one of the funniest comics that I've ever liked.
How was that?

1758
01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:38.340
I was in New York one night and Tony was doing the old Boston right.

1759
01:36:38.820 --> 01:36:42.480
It was four people in,
in the audience,
right.
Tony is crushing.

1760
01:36:42.780 --> 01:36:45.000
Some lady has to go to the bathroom.
She's like,

1761
01:36:45.001 --> 01:36:49.740
could you wait as he waits for it to come back because 20 more minutes.

1762
01:36:49.830 --> 01:36:52.470
He's the only guy I've ever seen.
You get a standing o from four people.

1763
01:36:52.560 --> 01:36:55.710
<v 1>That's hilarious.
Yeah.
There's something about doing those fucking sets.</v>

1764
01:36:55.711 --> 01:36:57.300
We should talk about that at the comedy store too,

1765
01:36:57.301 --> 01:36:59.820
that does those sets that you would get where there's only like 10 people in the

1766
01:36:59.821 --> 01:37:03.060
audience or less.
It's so much fun.
I did two with danger fields,

1767
01:37:03.070 --> 01:37:06.360
wants me and a bunch of other dudes.
It was like three,

1768
01:37:06.450 --> 01:37:09.840
three other comics that also did sets in front of fucking two people.

1769
01:37:10.320 --> 01:37:13.890
It was one of those gigs where danger fields is a weird place.
You know,

1770
01:37:13.891 --> 01:37:15.750
it was like,
it was Rodney Dangerfield,

1771
01:37:16.130 --> 01:37:20.420
<v 7>but was it still down the street from,
from the comic strip I was nowadays</v>

1772
01:37:20.920 --> 01:37:23.360
<v 1>remember,
I don't even remember what street it was on.</v>

1773
01:37:23.361 --> 01:37:25.880
I know it was somewhere on the east side.
I did a lot of gigs in there though.

1774
01:37:25.930 --> 01:37:27.260
Yeah,
it was Isa.
But,
um,

1775
01:37:27.320 --> 01:37:30.380
when I lived in New York that was like one of my main spots cause they give you

1776
01:37:30.381 --> 01:37:33.140
what they called Prom shows and what prompts shows were,

1777
01:37:33.141 --> 01:37:38.141
and I did these with our blue bell and I did these with a auto and George and a

1778
01:37:38.631 --> 01:37:42.200
couple other guys.
I can't remember their names,
but what we did was we,

1779
01:37:42.201 --> 01:37:46.310
we were forced to do that.
They never took the audience out.

1780
01:37:46.640 --> 01:37:48.110
They would stuff them in with kids.

1781
01:37:48.111 --> 01:37:52.010
They were all like 17 and drunk and throwing up and fallen out of their chairs

1782
01:37:52.160 --> 01:37:56.750
and then violent like one big football player got on stage and and blues,

1783
01:37:56.760 --> 01:38:00.570
fucking cigar smoke and Al Belle's face and took the microphone from him and no

1784
01:38:00.571 --> 01:38:02.880
one did shit about it.
Man.
It was a big ass kid.

1785
01:38:02.881 --> 01:38:06.720
He was a big kid and you know they would do as these kids would be,

1786
01:38:06.721 --> 01:38:07.680
they would do their prom,

1787
01:38:07.710 --> 01:38:10.500
they would have their prom and then they would come to a comedy show and they

1788
01:38:10.501 --> 01:38:14.250
never took the audience out.
They just kept pumping more people in.

1789
01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:16.200
So they wanted you to come up again.

1790
01:38:16.250 --> 01:38:19.830
Do you would do five or six shows in a night.
So they would have a rotation,

1791
01:38:19.831 --> 01:38:23.280
they would have a host and then they'll have like an opener and then the second

1792
01:38:23.281 --> 01:38:24.114
guy,
the third guy,

1793
01:38:24.180 --> 01:38:28.350
and then you would go back up again and the same people would be there.

1794
01:38:28.620 --> 01:38:30.900
It would be there and they would say you have to do the same act cause we want

1795
01:38:30.901 --> 01:38:33.450
to get rid of them.
But you're not going to do the same act.

1796
01:38:33.960 --> 01:38:36.330
You're not going to want to eat it,
man.
You're not going to want to bomb.

1797
01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:38.970
So they would tell you to do the same Mac and I always a,
I be like,
look man,

1798
01:38:38.971 --> 01:38:42.360
you hired me to do comedy.
You can't tell me what comedy to do.
Right.
You know,

1799
01:38:42.361 --> 01:38:44.880
once you,
you're going to throw me out five times a night,
that's all good.

1800
01:38:44.881 --> 01:38:47.070
But you're not,
you can't tell me what comedy do.

1801
01:38:47.071 --> 01:38:50.160
I'm not going to die up there still kids who are still there.

1802
01:38:50.250 --> 01:38:53.370
And you would do a half hour sets and you would word it depends.

1803
01:38:53.371 --> 01:38:55.800
Sometimes we have 20 minutes.
Depends on how many people are in the show.

1804
01:38:55.950 --> 01:38:58.710
But the kids were there and you would do your,

1805
01:38:58.790 --> 01:39:02.940
your sat and they wanted you to go and do the exact same set for the exact same

1806
01:39:02.941 --> 01:39:05.210
kids in an hour and a half.
That is,

1807
01:39:05.220 --> 01:39:07.850
they wanted to get rid of the kids and you know,
they would just put,

1808
01:39:07.860 --> 01:39:11.340
people would just pull up in limos and then the guy would come in every now and

1809
01:39:11.341 --> 01:39:13.560
then if you're going the show,
this guy is Bobby,
have you seen the show?

1810
01:39:13.560 --> 01:39:15.870
Have you seen a show?
If you've seen it,
please leave.
If you've seen it,

1811
01:39:15.871 --> 01:39:19.230
please leave.
And these kids are just running around like fucking animals.

1812
01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:23.160
So I did that play.
So danger fields was a weird club man.
It was real weird.

1813
01:39:23.250 --> 01:39:26.220
It was real dark and nobody went there.
Man.

1814
01:39:26.221 --> 01:39:29.780
It was fucking a small crowds all the time and not the best comics.
I've,

1815
01:39:29.820 --> 01:39:32.070
to be honest,
it wasn't like the highest level guys.

1816
01:39:32.071 --> 01:39:35.640
The highest level guys were at the Strip and in catch a rising star back then.

1817
01:39:35.790 --> 01:39:38.720
So anyway,
this fucking couple comes in.
We're all sitting around.

1818
01:39:38.740 --> 01:39:43.260
In my spot was at like eight o'clock and I got there and everybody was just

1819
01:39:43.261 --> 01:39:44.430
sitting in the,
um,
in,

1820
01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:47.340
in the bar area and the show was already supposed to start it.
I'm like,

1821
01:39:47.341 --> 01:39:50.040
what the fuck's going on?
And they were like,
there's no one here.
I go,

1822
01:39:50.041 --> 01:39:51.840
there's no one here.
No one zero.

1823
01:39:51.930 --> 01:39:54.720
And then right when we were saying that two people showed up right this way,

1824
01:39:54.721 --> 01:39:57.410
ladies and gentlemen,
right this way.
And they lead them into the showroom.

1825
01:39:57.420 --> 01:39:58.380
Like these people have no idea.

1826
01:39:58.381 --> 01:40:00.810
We're here to see the shell and they pay their money and they get their tickets.

1827
01:40:00.811 --> 01:40:04.740
They think there's a fucking show gone.
They walk in there,
it's dead empty.

1828
01:40:06.030 --> 01:40:08.180
And they sit down by themselves and ladies,
gentlemen,

1829
01:40:08.190 --> 01:40:10.320
please welcome your emcee for this evening.

1830
01:40:10.500 --> 01:40:14.220
And he brings up the MC and the MC was some dude,
he had like,
oh look,

1831
01:40:14.480 --> 01:40:17.070
a little keyboard on stage to do this kind of a musical thing.

1832
01:40:17.160 --> 01:40:20.700
So he goes up in front of two fucking people and then another comic goes up and

1833
01:40:20.701 --> 01:40:21.361
he does his set.

1834
01:40:21.361 --> 01:40:24.180
And then I went up and I did my sat and then I had another guy went up and we

1835
01:40:24.181 --> 01:40:27.730
did,
we did a real full show for two people.
Sweet.
Cool.
It was.

1836
01:40:27.750 --> 01:40:29.400
But when you do those man,

1837
01:40:29.430 --> 01:40:32.700
it's like you get a weird connection with people that you don't get.
You know,

1838
01:40:32.701 --> 01:40:34.390
you don't,
you don't get in a big ass.

1839
01:40:34.630 --> 01:40:36.580
<v 8>I have done something very similar a couple of times,</v>

1840
01:40:36.581 --> 01:40:38.440
but I don't do my regular shit.

1841
01:40:38.441 --> 01:40:43.441
Then I ended up just fucking around and being real like sarcastic like yeah.

1842
01:40:44.021 --> 01:40:46.780
So I went to the store,
you know like,
like I wouldn't,

1843
01:40:46.781 --> 01:40:48.890
I do it a completely different just because I,

1844
01:40:48.891 --> 01:40:50.580
I don't even want to bother trying.
Well

1845
01:40:50.650 --> 01:40:52.720
<v 1>my whole thing,
I went to the store,</v>

1846
01:40:52.880 --> 01:40:56.470
you actually could do the opposite and it would help your act and the opposite

1847
01:40:56.471 --> 01:40:57.550
being you,
you know,

1848
01:40:57.551 --> 01:41:01.150
realize like how much of your axioms fake and you can get away with it because

1849
01:41:01.151 --> 01:41:04.840
there's 200 people as opposed to when you're telling it just to one person,

1850
01:41:04.990 --> 01:41:08.260
you can really trim the fat off your material that way.
You know,
for me,

1851
01:41:08.261 --> 01:41:11.780
I find small crowds really make you trim the fat because you,
you,
you,

1852
01:41:11.800 --> 01:41:16.090
you're not putting on a show anymore.
You're talking to people and so,
yeah,

1853
01:41:16.091 --> 01:41:17.050
and when you're doing that,
you know,

1854
01:41:17.051 --> 01:41:21.250
you really get to the real meat of the topic better instead of like some

1855
01:41:21.251 --> 01:41:26.170
bullshit show stuff where you're saying things.
So first I not really,

1856
01:41:26.410 --> 01:41:27.510
well,
I thought

1857
01:41:28.410 --> 01:41:31.050
<v 5>plus the plus the fact that me personally,</v>

1858
01:41:31.650 --> 01:41:33.630
I think that if you paid your money,

1859
01:41:33.720 --> 01:41:36.390
it doesn't matter if it's two or like a hundred dog y'all,

1860
01:41:36.420 --> 01:41:38.490
y'all pay just as much as the rest of these people.

1861
01:41:38.491 --> 01:41:41.970
So why not give y'all something other than me fucking around like I,

1862
01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:46.650
that's one thing I personally hate coming from New York is when people are like,

1863
01:41:46.680 --> 01:41:49.220
oh,
it's a full house tonight.
Who gives a fuck?
It's,

1864
01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:54.680
it's five people here and all of them are paying $8 a fucking drink less.

1865
01:41:54.780 --> 01:41:57.070
I have some fun.
You know what I'm saying?
That's how I look at it.

1866
01:41:57.080 --> 01:42:00.960
It was worse than the of slaves.
There is no disappointment,

1867
01:42:00.961 --> 01:42:03.840
especially with me at the stage that I'm at.

1868
01:42:04.230 --> 01:42:07.980
I know that y'all didn't come to see me anyway.
So for me to be arrogant,

1869
01:42:08.070 --> 01:42:10.140
that's even more of me being a jackass.

1870
01:42:10.260 --> 01:42:13.360
<v 1>Yeah.
It's just shit.
You feel like more pressure.
That's what it feels like.</v>

1871
01:42:13.361 --> 01:42:15.810
Doesn't feel more pressure for you.
And there's like only a couple of people.

1872
01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:20.120
<v 8>No,
I,
I don't even try.
So why not?
Why don't you try it?</v>

1873
01:42:20.180 --> 01:42:23.690
Because it's just,
to me,
that's just,
I don't know.
I just,

1874
01:42:24.720 --> 01:42:26.440
when I'm clearly your father,

1875
01:42:26.710 --> 01:42:30.640
mother fucker needs coffee more than I've done it three times and all three

1876
01:42:30.680 --> 01:42:33.830
times.
I just just,
it was like,
fuck,
there's two people there.
I don't give a shit,

1877
01:42:34.990 --> 01:42:37.460
<v 1>but why wouldn't he give a shit?
Why wouldn't you treat those two people?</v>

1878
01:42:37.461 --> 01:42:38.294
Like it's a real show.

1879
01:42:38.490 --> 01:42:39.323
<v 5>Oh,</v>

1880
01:42:39.990 --> 01:42:44.370
<v 8>for now it's the energy to,
to waste on TV.
Oh God.
Okay.</v>

1881
01:42:44.820 --> 01:42:45.653
Right.

1882
01:42:45.860 --> 01:42:50.320
<v 5>If there's two people there,
like didn't those,
what makes,</v>

1883
01:42:50.500 --> 01:42:52.210
I dunno.
Like I,
they still special.

1884
01:42:52.530 --> 01:42:57.160
<v 8>Here's the thing with me,
I started Cami,
completely different.
I,
you know,
I,</v>

1885
01:42:57.220 --> 01:43:00.720
I think of it as like I could jump on Ustream and talk to two people,

1886
01:43:01.380 --> 01:43:05.100
but I jumped on Ustream and I talked in like a hundred people immediately.

1887
01:43:05.250 --> 01:43:07.290
You know,
it's,
to me that's,
that's way worth it.

1888
01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:10.740
Then going to a comedy club and doing the same thing in front of two people that

1889
01:43:10.770 --> 01:43:12.930
they're like,
who's this guy on stage?
You know,

1890
01:43:13.380 --> 01:43:17.400
like that person is never going to follow me.
That person is not.
If I do good,

1891
01:43:17.401 --> 01:43:20.460
those two people are just going to most likely just going to go away and not

1892
01:43:20.461 --> 01:43:23.870
even remember that night.
That's a weird way of looking at it

1893
01:43:26.960 --> 01:43:30.360
<v 5>like Noah,
but you're absolutely right.
Basically.
Hold on.
Gosh,</v>

1894
01:43:30.380 --> 01:43:33.500
we can't talk over each other like that.
You're absolutely right though man.

1895
01:43:33.540 --> 01:43:37.200
Because when you say that you started comedy differently,

1896
01:43:38.130 --> 01:43:42.390
that's true because like I've had to do those shows,
right?

1897
01:43:42.450 --> 01:43:47.370
Like I've had to do a show for two people period and you haven't had to do that

1898
01:43:47.680 --> 01:43:50.260
<v 8>I guess.
I don't know.
I mean I do,
I do.</v>

1899
01:43:50.261 --> 01:43:53.720
I do open mic almost every day and I do it in front of two people.
I've done it.

1900
01:43:53.750 --> 01:43:53.990
We've,

1901
01:43:53.990 --> 01:43:56.840
what's even worse is five people that have seen your act a million times cause

1902
01:43:56.841 --> 01:43:59.690
they're all comics and they're not even a real audience.
But you're like,

1903
01:43:59.691 --> 01:44:04.470
why am I doing so like doesn't he worked with Uli joke?
Yeah.

1904
01:44:04.850 --> 01:44:07.460
So then if you're doing that,

1905
01:44:07.461 --> 01:44:11.390
you already know that it's practice for you to perform a lot of pizzas too easy

1906
01:44:11.391 --> 01:44:13.430
for you to get on stage.
You don't appreciate it enough.

1907
01:44:13.990 --> 01:44:18.080
If you were really grinding,
if you were really trying to really be a comic,

1908
01:44:18.440 --> 01:44:21.670
you're talking about the situations I'm in,
which is open mikes.
Yeah,
it's,
it's,

1909
01:44:21.710 --> 01:44:25.220
it's like most of the time if there's two people,
two people in that audience,

1910
01:44:25.221 --> 01:44:29.510
man,
you got to treat those two people.
Like that's a crowd.
It's harder to do,

1911
01:44:29.570 --> 01:44:32.660
but you're not doing a real show and open mics.
You're just fucking around.

1912
01:44:32.661 --> 01:44:35.130
So like when I go on stage,
I'm not going to a full,

1913
01:44:35.770 --> 01:44:37.490
but you're doing material right?
I do.

1914
01:44:37.760 --> 01:44:39.290
I'd love to just sit there with a thumb up my ass.

1915
01:44:39.291 --> 01:44:42.410
I'm just saying I don't do my normal shit.
I fucking just sit there and be like,

1916
01:44:42.411 --> 01:44:46.190
so you know,
I do it like a completely different act.
It's like,
Hey,

1917
01:44:46.191 --> 01:44:48.890
I'm not you like saying is that you don't have to do that.

1918
01:44:49.250 --> 01:44:53.690
You can do a version of your act that's,
that's better.
You know,

1919
01:44:53.691 --> 01:44:56.240
you could trim it down and trim it down for two people.
It's so,

1920
01:44:56.540 --> 01:44:58.330
sometimes it feels weird,
you know,
and,
and,

1921
01:44:58.331 --> 01:45:02.430
and you realize what jokes that stand out in your act as being artificial when

1922
01:45:02.440 --> 01:45:04.940
you're,
when you're talking to two people,
man,
you can really,

1923
01:45:04.970 --> 01:45:08.210
you feel like the jokes that aren't good,
you know,
they're like,
man,

1924
01:45:08.211 --> 01:45:11.690
this one needs work.
This is the shits clunky.
It feels weird to talk to people.

1925
01:45:11.740 --> 01:45:12.573
But what I'm saying,

1926
01:45:12.740 --> 01:45:15.500
you can benefit if you really want to truly keep doing standup,

1927
01:45:15.800 --> 01:45:18.290
you can benefit from that just by doing your real set.

1928
01:45:18.320 --> 01:45:22.740
If you get a laugh from two people,
you know that joke is going on.

1929
01:45:25.580 --> 01:45:29.340
I guess the biggest reason why I think this is why I think it elevate.
Uh,

1930
01:45:29.420 --> 01:45:33.110
there's been so many times doing open mic where you do a new bit that you're,

1931
01:45:33.111 --> 01:45:36.770
you,
you,
you,
you believe in and you like it and it fucking no,
no one,

1932
01:45:36.771 --> 01:45:40.610
no response at all.
So you try it again,
same exact thing,
no response at all.

1933
01:45:40.790 --> 01:45:44.960
Then you get a real show and then you try that same bit and it fucking kills and

1934
01:45:44.961 --> 01:45:45.711
you're like,
God damn,

1935
01:45:45.711 --> 01:45:49.700
I almost lost that bit because that bit failed because you're in this horrible

1936
01:45:49.701 --> 01:45:52.070
atmosphere of like two people or

1937
01:45:54.050 --> 01:45:57.500
it's all a part of the vibe.
You got to,
you got to tune it all in.

1938
01:45:57.860 --> 01:46:00.620
It's all a part of the process of being a standup comic.
You know,

1939
01:46:00.621 --> 01:46:04.040
you can't really develop only in front of large audiences.

1940
01:46:04.160 --> 01:46:05.330
Once you've got your shit together,

1941
01:46:05.331 --> 01:46:08.840
then you could pretty much do any kind of audience.
I think you're thinking,

1942
01:46:08.841 --> 01:46:10.490
I'm saying something completely different cause you're,

1943
01:46:10.491 --> 01:46:13.880
you're making it seem like you don't like to perform when there's two people you

1944
01:46:13.920 --> 01:46:17.280
liked.
[inaudible] that's not my saying what section?
Saying that when I'm done,

1945
01:46:17.390 --> 01:46:20.930
there's two people in the audience,
I'm not going to fucking do a whole like,
hey,

1946
01:46:20.931 --> 01:46:23.690
so I went down the street.
I don't want to just kind of fuck around.

1947
01:46:23.691 --> 01:46:26.190
I'm not going to do my regular material.
I'm going to just go,

1948
01:46:26.210 --> 01:46:29.120
I'm not going to give them the,
I understand what you're saying.
So let's,

1949
01:46:29.121 --> 01:46:33.440
let's break that down.
Let's just of interesting,
no,

1950
01:46:33.441 --> 01:46:35.390
he's got say pretty basic.
It's kind of interesting.

1951
01:46:35.690 --> 01:46:37.630
Let's break that down because what you,

1952
01:46:37.631 --> 01:46:40.430
what you're saying is that you're not going to give them this like,
hey,

1953
01:46:40.580 --> 01:46:43.760
like really animated when he's saying,
I'm not saying that.

1954
01:46:43.761 --> 01:46:48.761
I like how I considered like that the act that I do is takes a lot of like

1955
01:46:50.610 --> 01:46:54.690
timing and,
and like,
uh,
like it's a whole process.

1956
01:46:54.690 --> 01:46:56.970
It's not just sitting out there going,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

1957
01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:00.380
It's kind of like,
it's more work than then just saying,
you know what,

1958
01:47:00.381 --> 01:47:02.670
I'm just going to fuck around and do some,
some bits,
you know,

1959
01:47:02.671 --> 01:47:06.240
just try some stuff or,
or,
you know,
just fuck around.
So I would,

1960
01:47:06.241 --> 01:47:07.890
so if there's two people in the audience,

1961
01:47:07.891 --> 01:47:12.891
I'm not going to like bother trying to like change my whole act to go around to

1962
01:47:13.531 --> 01:47:17.880
people,
you know what I'm saying is why does it have to be changed?

1963
01:47:18.390 --> 01:47:22.120
Because it's funnier if you say certain things when there's an audience.
It's,

1964
01:47:22.130 --> 01:47:24.990
it's funny if you say the same thing in front of two people is you should say it

1965
01:47:24.991 --> 01:47:28.050
different.
You agree if there's a group of people,
right?

1966
01:47:28.590 --> 01:47:31.320
Sometimes it depends on what you're talking about,
what I could sign it.

1967
01:47:31.321 --> 01:47:35.120
They're completely different in,
in front of 400 people then two people.
Right?

1968
01:47:35.580 --> 01:47:40.290
But why even fuck around trying to even do the math of how it would work best?

1969
01:47:40.380 --> 01:47:41.370
Wouldn't you just want to be like,
hey,

1970
01:47:41.371 --> 01:47:45.550
there's two pp or I'm just gonna fuck around some new shit.
I think,
um,

1971
01:47:45.600 --> 01:47:48.630
I think you have to address the fact,
obviously this is only two people.

1972
01:47:48.631 --> 01:47:51.120
You have to make some light to that.
But then once you do that,

1973
01:47:51.300 --> 01:47:54.240
you can pretty much,
if your act as tight,
you could pretty much do your act.

1974
01:47:54.460 --> 01:47:56.850
But you know,
could or you could just fuck around.
You know,

1975
01:47:56.851 --> 01:48:01.450
why even try to change things.
Because what I'm saying is for me

1976
01:48:01.570 --> 01:48:05.050
<v 1>when I do small crowds,
it makes me well aware of the Ed,</v>

1977
01:48:05.051 --> 01:48:08.410
the space that I have on my act and I need to trim out like I'm talking too much

1978
01:48:08.411 --> 01:48:12.120
here or this is too disingenuous or this is so this seems a little fake.

1979
01:48:12.180 --> 01:48:14.830
You can tell it's like,
yeah,
this is like my segway.

1980
01:48:14.831 --> 01:48:17.610
The segway is like ham handed,
you know this,

1981
01:48:17.790 --> 01:48:21.030
this punchline is like a little like sticky,
like yeah.
Yeah.

1982
01:48:21.050 --> 01:48:22.180
I feel the difference when I do

1983
01:48:23.100 --> 01:48:26.630
<v 7>cause I mean like me personally,</v>

1984
01:48:26.631 --> 01:48:31.631
I wish that I knew when I did the shows for four people that I would be playing

1985
01:48:31.851 --> 01:48:35.150
for 200 sometime in the near future.

1986
01:48:35.420 --> 01:48:38.210
So that's why I was more like whenever I get onstage,

1987
01:48:38.280 --> 01:48:42.980
no matter how many people it is,
I got to make the most of this being on a stage.

1988
01:48:43.010 --> 01:48:47.270
Even in,
even in New York where I was,
where you get onstage a lot more.

1989
01:48:48.020 --> 01:48:51.830
Even there,
it's like,
oh,
I used to always just be like,

1990
01:48:51.860 --> 01:48:55.310
I'm so grateful to be onstage at all.
First of all.

1991
01:48:55.700 --> 01:48:58.130
Second of all,
um,

1992
01:48:58.790 --> 01:49:03.790
maybe I just appreciate that these people would even listen to my bullshit.

1993
01:49:05.060 --> 01:49:09.340
Who in the fuck am I that I'm looking at y'all like it should be more.
Yeah,

1994
01:49:09.920 --> 01:49:10.160
I want to

1995
01:49:10.160 --> 01:49:12.110
<v 1>do it.
You have to think about it like that.
You know,</v>

1996
01:49:12.120 --> 01:49:17.120
you have to be almost obsessed with it.
You know?
Oh,
I'm saying about this,

1997
01:49:17.121 --> 01:49:19.100
uh,
doing,
you know,

1998
01:49:19.190 --> 01:49:24.170
doing shows and not appreciating it as much or not thinking about as much.

1999
01:49:24.390 --> 01:49:24.981
Brian has.

2000
01:49:24.981 --> 01:49:28.130
One point that's really important is that when you're starting out and you start

2001
01:49:28.190 --> 01:49:32.180
eating,
anytime you eat it,
it chips away a big chunk of your confidence.

2002
01:49:32.360 --> 01:49:34.160
And when you can look at something and go,
well,

2003
01:49:34.161 --> 01:49:35.930
this is just not even set up for comedy.

2004
01:49:35.931 --> 01:49:40.120
Why am I fucking running uphill with sandbags?
You know,
this is getting,

2005
01:49:40.130 --> 01:49:41.300
give me a bad feeling.

2006
01:49:41.301 --> 01:49:43.840
I'm going to go up there and do some jokes that I have some,
you know,

2007
01:49:43.850 --> 01:49:46.550
some hope for and they're gonna die because it's not an easy crowd.

2008
01:49:46.700 --> 01:49:48.010
So that point too,
I see

2009
01:49:48.010 --> 01:49:51.310
<v 8>that point too,
but uh,
yeah,
there's both.
It's really,</v>

2010
01:49:51.311 --> 01:49:54.890
it's not either or there's bolts.
It's a completely personal preference.

2011
01:49:54.891 --> 01:49:58.120
And like last time I was on stage was right after we got out of Portland,

2012
01:49:58.121 --> 01:50:01.930
I decided to do an open mic at Sal's and I decided,
you know what,

2013
01:50:01.960 --> 01:50:05.950
just as an idea,
because I had just done five shows in a row as certain way,

2014
01:50:06.130 --> 01:50:11.130
I'm going to do the exact same way at south there was about eight people in the

2015
01:50:11.441 --> 01:50:13.210
audience.
I did the exact,

2016
01:50:13.211 --> 01:50:17.920
like almost a recorded version of what I just did the whole week just to see

2017
01:50:17.921 --> 01:50:21.520
what happens.
And it was the most awkward mother fucking thing ever.

2018
01:50:21.550 --> 01:50:23.860
I'll let you listen to the,
it's so weird.

2019
01:50:24.190 --> 01:50:27.910
I started like I have a part of my act where I just started doing this where I

2020
01:50:27.911 --> 01:50:30.580
have a really uncomfortable pause,
you know?

2021
01:50:30.610 --> 01:50:33.870
And then mostly like there would be like a couple of people that start get it

2022
01:50:33.880 --> 01:50:35.230
like,
okay,
I get it now.

2023
01:50:35.231 --> 01:50:38.980
This is creepy at league and then a bunch of people start laughing.
I did that.

2024
01:50:38.981 --> 01:50:40.540
They're in front of eight people,
no one.

2025
01:50:40.630 --> 01:50:44.200
There was never that one person that just started giggling to get it to to make

2026
01:50:44.201 --> 01:50:47.260
the other people laugh and so that it was just like complete silence.

2027
01:50:47.320 --> 01:50:51.010
It was so weird.
You blame the audience or do you blame the way you perform?
No,

2028
01:50:51.011 --> 01:50:52.870
no.
I think the whole idea of that bit,

2029
01:50:52.871 --> 01:50:56.290
that one particular bit is that there's going to be a few people that get it and

2030
01:50:56.291 --> 01:50:59.820
start giggling and then the other pages really can't,

2031
01:51:00.290 --> 01:51:02.980
can't really come into to the mob mentality and everyone will laugh at one

2032
01:51:02.981 --> 01:51:07.700
person.
It's,
it's where I said,
you're a fucking porn star.
Right,

2033
01:51:07.990 --> 01:51:10.360
and just sit there and sit there and it's something,

2034
01:51:10.361 --> 01:51:12.910
a couple of people giggle and then suddenly everyone starts fucking giggling.

2035
01:51:12.911 --> 01:51:14.260
It's like this new thing I started importantly,

2036
01:51:14.440 --> 01:51:17.620
so I did that at South Korea's not that one.
We'll get to it.

2037
01:51:17.621 --> 01:51:20.050
Sometimes people are giggling just because they want to laugh.

2038
01:51:20.410 --> 01:51:22.840
Sometimes people are Google them because they're at a comedy show and no one

2039
01:51:22.860 --> 01:51:24.370
drinks and they just want to laugh.

2040
01:51:24.520 --> 01:51:26.890
And if you give them a pause and they're laughing at some stuff before,

2041
01:51:26.891 --> 01:51:30.160
they'll just start laughing.
Right,
right.
But it's,
that's not what in this case,

2042
01:51:30.190 --> 01:51:34.060
this case,
this case is the whole bit is I can't give away my bit,

2043
01:51:34.061 --> 01:51:36.910
but you know that what you're saying is that people put it together was like

2044
01:51:36.911 --> 01:51:39.460
comparing that with,
wait,
you're a fucking porn star.

2045
01:51:39.520 --> 01:51:43.000
So one person starts giggling.
Not Making enough sense without saying the bill.

2046
01:51:43.960 --> 01:51:45.590
So anyways,
well I know what you're saying.

2047
01:51:46.190 --> 01:51:48.110
<v 7>No,
but I know what he's saying.</v>

2048
01:51:48.560 --> 01:51:50.060
<v 8>It's like it's something like if you have,</v>

2049
01:51:50.790 --> 01:51:53.970
you gotta got to adjust when there's a small crowd.
It's that simple.

2050
01:51:54.450 --> 01:51:55.530
I know what you're saying.
I just,

2051
01:51:55.570 --> 01:51:59.580
so you just wanted to try it as an experiment to not adjust,
not adjust.

2052
01:51:59.640 --> 01:52:03.780
Did you do,
exactly.
I worked on some bits.
Somebody who's completely worked fine.

2053
01:52:03.840 --> 01:52:06.130
Did you feel like bailing out halfway into it though?

2054
01:52:06.210 --> 01:52:09.360
Because it's eight people and most of these people were just other comics.

2055
01:52:09.420 --> 01:52:11.400
So I was just like,
you know,
I'm gonna experiment with this.

2056
01:52:11.401 --> 01:52:14.100
That's one good thing about what we're doing every day is just experimenting.

2057
01:52:14.150 --> 01:52:17.010
You know?
That's just an experiment.
So what happens?
It's like a video again.

2058
01:52:17.070 --> 01:52:20.850
Like am I try jumping over this platform once we recommend whatever you do,

2059
01:52:20.851 --> 01:52:24.020
don't try to bomb.
Oh I don't try to bomb.
And it's not like,

2060
01:52:24.450 --> 01:52:28.220
and it's not like this is one thing you would tell someone and I tried,

2061
01:52:28.290 --> 01:52:30.210
I'm just thinking about going up there and bombing on purpose.

2062
01:52:32.060 --> 01:52:33.220
That's the beauty of open mic though.

2063
01:52:34.790 --> 01:52:36.110
<v 7>That's one of those things where as though,</v>

2064
01:52:36.111 --> 01:52:38.980
cause you lived in New York for awhile,
right Joe?
Yeah.

2065
01:52:39.320 --> 01:52:43.250
That's one of the things that being out here and being in New York,

2066
01:52:43.610 --> 01:52:48.610
I think when you are in New York doing comedy stage time is like yes you get on

2067
01:52:50.291 --> 01:52:52.450
stage more.
But it's kind of harder to,

2068
01:52:52.451 --> 01:52:55.490
cause when I was there I had to pay to go up on open mics.

2069
01:52:55.520 --> 01:52:59.810
I had to either pay $5 or buy a couple of drinks or do something to get our open

2070
01:52:59.811 --> 01:53:03.980
mics.
That was like six years ago.
I don't know if it's changed since then,

2071
01:53:03.981 --> 01:53:06.590
but you had to spend money to get on that stage,

2072
01:53:06.800 --> 01:53:10.460
so no matter what or who was there,

2073
01:53:10.461 --> 01:53:14.090
you just spent some money to talk and now you're going to fuck around.

2074
01:53:14.300 --> 01:53:17.000
So I think at my level,

2075
01:53:17.240 --> 01:53:20.300
we didn't have time to play because I just paid to get on a stage,

2076
01:53:20.540 --> 01:53:24.110
so I'm going to try to get better.
Oh.
When I was there,

2077
01:53:24.111 --> 01:53:27.620
you had to either buy two drinks,
which for comics was like $6 we all,

2078
01:53:27.621 --> 01:53:32.090
she had to pay $5 and dark for mostly every open mic.

2079
01:53:32.180 --> 01:53:33.170
At a comedy club?

2080
01:53:34.110 --> 01:53:39.090
<v 8>Yeah.
$5.
Yeah.
Wow.
Cafe or Moda?
Most places.</v>

2081
01:53:39.091 --> 01:53:42.180
Most places make you buy her a drink.
Sounds does.
It makes you buy a drink.

2082
01:53:42.210 --> 01:53:47.190
I think it was a comics up to buy a now to spend $5 and you get a ticket and

2083
01:53:47.191 --> 01:53:51.430
then you're allowed to go on stage.
But actually,
so it's common.
Common.

2084
01:53:51.500 --> 01:53:55.140
It's common.
It's not.
I'm in,
but it's in La,
it's common.

2085
01:53:55.220 --> 01:53:55.780
<v 4>It's looked at.</v>

2086
01:53:55.780 --> 01:53:59.090
The most important thing is that there is some sort of an open mic system.
Right.

2087
01:53:59.091 --> 01:54:01.190
It's unfortunate when you get an open mic system,
it makes you pay it.

2088
01:54:01.570 --> 01:54:03.750
<v 8>I don't mind it because I'm going to fucking buy a beer,</v>

2089
01:54:04.460 --> 01:54:08.370
but still some guys don't have five bucks every day.
Like I told,
I told Boone,

2090
01:54:08.371 --> 01:54:12.510
you guys know Boone,
he,
he's a homeless guy.
I think he's home on this,

2091
01:54:12.511 --> 01:54:16.950
but he isn't open or he's a miker and he,
I think he's hilarious.
And he was like,

2092
01:54:16.951 --> 01:54:19.440
I'm like,
why aren't you going to,
you know,
sounds anymore.
And he goes,
well,

2093
01:54:19.441 --> 01:54:22.590
because I,
I can't afford that,
you know,
five bucks.
And I'm like,
look,

2094
01:54:22.620 --> 01:54:23.640
I have one or two beers.

2095
01:54:23.670 --> 01:54:26.490
I have two or three beers at least every time I go to south,

2096
01:54:26.670 --> 01:54:29.880
you just let me know.
I'll buy you a beer,
get you a ticket,
you know,
so,
um,

2097
01:54:30.030 --> 01:54:31.440
you can mooch off my beers

2098
01:54:31.990 --> 01:54:36.940
<v 7>plugin.
It's crazy.
It's a fun,</v>

2099
01:54:37.160 --> 01:54:39.500
crazy because in New York,

2100
01:54:39.501 --> 01:54:44.010
like I remember talking to sell whether he was going to start a charge,

2101
01:54:44.011 --> 01:54:44.870
he's like,
yeah,

2102
01:54:44.871 --> 01:54:48.110
might as well cause it's like nobody that's not really common from what I've

2103
01:54:48.111 --> 01:54:51.830
seen here when I first got here.
But now it's coming.

2104
01:54:51.860 --> 01:54:56.300
Young people going to have to kick out and I think a lot less of that plan will

2105
01:54:56.301 --> 01:54:57.860
be going on as far as,

2106
01:54:58.220 --> 01:55:02.840
well I can just play around because dog,
you just kicked out and

2107
01:55:03.540 --> 01:55:05.520
<v 4>if you're going to do it and if you're going to have a place to call up,</v>

2108
01:55:05.521 --> 01:55:07.380
five bucks is not bad.
And if you know,

2109
01:55:07.381 --> 01:55:10.290
if that's the difference between having an open mic night and not having an open

2110
01:55:10.291 --> 01:55:13.830
mic night,
then it's worth the five bucks because it's the most important thing,

2111
01:55:13.831 --> 01:55:17.790
man.
Stage time,
getting,
getting good spots,
getting a bunch of people around you.

2112
01:55:18.150 --> 01:55:21.200
There's no substitute for it in the beginning,
right?
No,
not at all.
You know,

2113
01:55:21.210 --> 01:55:24.420
you gotta just hustle.
You got to do it all.
Even the stuff that sucks,

2114
01:55:24.421 --> 01:55:27.270
it just jump up there.
It's dude,
people

2115
01:55:27.270 --> 01:55:29.700
<v 6>cry.
As we were talking about,
I mean like,
you know,
you gotta be up there,</v>

2116
01:55:29.701 --> 01:55:31.920
you've got gotta be practicing no matter what.
I mean,
like I know shit.

2117
01:55:31.921 --> 01:55:34.380
I'm pretty much it,
you know,
we're the same level almost.
I mean like just,

2118
01:55:34.381 --> 01:55:37.220
I'm right above the open mic phase at my fucking point.
But uh,

2119
01:55:37.260 --> 01:55:38.340
when two people show up,

2120
01:55:38.341 --> 01:55:42.270
that means it was either them or nobody and they're doing you a favor just by

2121
01:55:42.271 --> 01:55:44.040
being there.
So,
I mean,
the least you can

2122
01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:47.370
<v 1>do is give them your fucking all and adjust yourself to the room and all that</v>

2123
01:55:47.670 --> 01:55:51.000
the most,
get it out,
you know,
appreciative you are in every situation.

2124
01:55:51.060 --> 01:55:55.380
The better the most that you appreciate every opportunity,
the better.
And that's,

2125
01:55:55.381 --> 01:55:58.320
you know,
there's negative at to it,
but it's also the,
you can do,

2126
01:55:58.321 --> 01:55:59.220
you could turn down around,

2127
01:55:59.370 --> 01:56:02.670
one person can go up in front of that same crowd and kill,
you know,
I'm an,

2128
01:56:02.671 --> 01:56:05.580
I've seen that before where I didn't like something I didn't leave the room was

2129
01:56:05.581 --> 01:56:08.860
not to my liking or whatever and I went up with a shitty attitude I'm going to

2130
01:56:08.861 --> 01:56:12.380
do to go on after you and kill and you're like,
okay,
I was an idiot,
you know.

2131
01:56:12.490 --> 01:56:14.980
Now I know.
You know I was young and stupid and it,

2132
01:56:15.020 --> 01:56:17.140
now I've made a mistake and now I learned from that shit

2133
01:56:18.690 --> 01:56:21.660
<v 5>cause it's like,
I guess to be honest,</v>

2134
01:56:21.661 --> 01:56:24.540
I'm just appreciative of the fact that

2135
01:56:26.050 --> 01:56:27.360
his legal,
first of all,

2136
01:56:27.361 --> 01:56:31.620
this is legal and second of all people let me talk some shit to him,
man.

2137
01:56:31.621 --> 01:56:36.420
Like if you were telling me when I was in jail that I'd ever be doing this or

2138
01:56:36.540 --> 01:56:39.660
like anything of this nature,
I told you he was crazy.

2139
01:56:39.780 --> 01:56:42.300
<v 1>How much are you getting worked out?
You getting roadwork and Shit,</v>

2140
01:56:42.370 --> 01:56:44.980
<v 5>you have an STD that just came out too,
right?
Oh,
it's coming out.</v>

2141
01:56:44.981 --> 01:56:47.650
They actually pushed the date back.
Hold on.
It's coming.

2142
01:56:48.160 --> 01:56:52.630
It's coming out on August the first now iTunes.
Uh,
yeah,

2143
01:56:52.660 --> 01:56:54.520
but it's actually,
um,

2144
01:56:54.910 --> 01:56:59.910
it's actually the first a CD that's coming out on George Carlin's label other

2145
01:57:00.881 --> 01:57:02.860
than his,
other than his word,

2146
01:57:03.520 --> 01:57:06.190
<v 1>your manager situation.
Skype keeps giving you shit advice.</v>

2147
01:57:07.780 --> 01:57:12.560
<v 5>Motherfucker got lucky with George Carlin
dog.</v>

2148
01:57:12.620 --> 01:57:15.880
It didn't take much work,
Jared,
and just really whatever you are a fellow.
No,

2149
01:57:15.890 --> 01:57:19.310
Jerry.
Jerry has a good,
it's the only,

2150
01:57:19.340 --> 01:57:22.720
it's the only CD other than Georgia has worked to ever come out on what's it

2151
01:57:22.721 --> 01:57:26.030
called?
It's called wildly inappropriate wild.

2152
01:57:27.550 --> 01:57:30.920
And yes,
your mom's going to get autographed copies,
but it's like,
um,

2153
01:57:31.430 --> 01:57:34.790
it's like that.
And I,
I'd like to thank Kelly man.

2154
01:57:34.791 --> 01:57:39.410
Kelly is Kelly Kelly Collins.
Awesome.
She's awesome.

2155
01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:44.510
Kelly George's daughter,
our daughter Kelly Carlin,
she,
uh,

2156
01:57:44.540 --> 01:57:49.450
she was the producer for a,
Paul showed yes,
she'd hundred producers for that.

2157
01:57:49.451 --> 01:57:52.970
Right.
She's awesome because she heard my CD and she's like,
Oh hey,
cool.
Like,

2158
01:57:52.971 --> 01:57:55.420
cause you have to clear it with all of these people because it's their father.

2159
01:57:55.490 --> 01:57:58.280
<v 1>So are you,
um,
are you doing standup on the road now?</v>

2160
01:57:59.120 --> 01:58:03.250
<v 5>I still don't have a TV credit coat into a coin to a lot of comedy club owners.</v>

2161
01:58:03.251 --> 01:58:05.600
I don't have a TV credits.
You can't even get like middle work.

2162
01:58:06.070 --> 01:58:10.350
Nobody's going to let me middle form.
What Doug?

2163
01:58:10.470 --> 01:58:13.540
Nobody's not let me middle for.
Well who says that?
Why?
Why do you say that?

2164
01:58:13.600 --> 01:58:17.860
It's happened too many times I've gotten complaints from middles.

2165
01:58:17.861 --> 01:58:22.000
And what's the complaint first is to first it's that I'm too dirty and then,

2166
01:58:22.240 --> 01:58:26.560
and then the second show I'll do my whole act clean and then the third show I'll

2167
01:58:26.561 --> 01:58:28.570
take out certain jokes that they don't want it done.

2168
01:58:29.110 --> 01:58:31.500
And by the fourth show is normally just fuck them.

2169
01:58:31.630 --> 01:58:36.430
It's just like we can't stop this dude from doing what he does.
And um,

2170
01:58:36.570 --> 01:58:37.261
<v 1>so you meet your,</v>

2171
01:58:37.261 --> 01:58:39.540
so you're saying they don't want you and because you're too good,

2172
01:58:39.600 --> 01:58:40.433
is that what you're saying?

2173
01:58:40.850 --> 01:58:41.980
<v 5>That's I would think,
but</v>

2174
01:58:41.980 --> 01:58:43.030
<v 7>that's kind of arrogant.</v>

2175
01:58:43.390 --> 01:58:46.250
<v 2>So I'm just like been there for some of these fucking shows where he's gotten,</v>

2176
01:58:46.960 --> 01:58:50.100
because he's scared to fall.
You call them out.
Who are they?
No,

2177
01:58:50.120 --> 01:58:54.430
it's been one of them had time for this.
Oh yeah,

2178
01:58:54.431 --> 01:58:59.140
that one was good when it was funny.
The position to call Omar for.
Okay,

2179
01:58:59.141 --> 01:59:00.940
well why don't you tell me the name and I'll call them out.

2180
01:59:01.360 --> 01:59:02.410
I'm not doing that either.

2181
01:59:02.870 --> 01:59:06.510
You Agley hit them with some subtle chest shit moves ahead.

2182
01:59:06.580 --> 01:59:08.380
I didn't go three gotta go.

2183
01:59:08.381 --> 01:59:11.670
Three army got to go through but it isn't dues.

2184
01:59:11.671 --> 01:59:13.660
Like I have some fucked up stories man.

2185
01:59:13.690 --> 01:59:16.840
And it's like so guys take you on the road with them.
No,
no,
no,
no.

2186
01:59:17.190 --> 01:59:18.930
<v 7>I'm just talking about just from Hollywood.</v>

2187
01:59:18.931 --> 01:59:21.930
People have seen my act in there like there's no way in hell I'm taking them on

2188
01:59:21.931 --> 01:59:22.610
the road

2189
01:59:22.610 --> 01:59:24.630
<v 2>and it's just cause you're too dirty.
What does it curve?</v>

2190
01:59:25.450 --> 01:59:29.000
Maybe know what I'll just say cause I'm too dirty even though I don't consider

2191
01:59:29.001 --> 01:59:31.310
myself dirty,
dirty,
astute on the road world with me.

2192
01:59:31.400 --> 01:59:36.270
Joey does being dirty and Joey that's ever existed to see his balls in the green

2193
01:59:36.271 --> 01:59:40.430
room.
I want us,
I don't want to say it's because I'm too funny cause who knows.

2194
01:59:40.431 --> 01:59:43.550
Funny is funny as well.
If you're following shit comics,

2195
01:59:43.551 --> 01:59:45.950
there are comics that want only scrubs to go on before them.

2196
01:59:46.130 --> 01:59:47.150
It's a real common thing.

2197
01:59:47.151 --> 01:59:50.330
Like there's a lot of people that get surprised when they come to see some of my

2198
01:59:50.331 --> 01:59:50.991
shows.
I'm like dude,

2199
01:59:50.991 --> 01:59:53.630
you got or we should fear and Joey Diaz going on in front of you.

2200
01:59:53.631 --> 01:59:54.800
Like those guys are both headlines,

2201
01:59:55.170 --> 01:59:55.651
<v 7>which is,</v>

2202
01:59:55.651 --> 02:00:00.651
which is because I think it's cause you're like you're like a a comic.

2203
02:00:01.200 --> 02:00:04.140
I mean you're a comedian.
You aren't somebody.

2204
02:00:04.200 --> 02:00:07.920
This just here to just say a couple of jokes and get on a sitcom.

2205
02:00:07.921 --> 02:00:11.580
Like you really take this as an art and as part of the art of comedy,

2206
02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:13.450
you don't want scrubs up

2207
02:00:13.690 --> 02:00:16.370
<v 2>front of me.
I don't want anybody to suffer,
suffer through any bad.</v>

2208
02:00:16.650 --> 02:00:17.483
<v 8>Exactly.</v>

2209
02:00:17.790 --> 02:00:20.730
I don't understand why you would even think like that because to me I think it's

2210
02:00:20.731 --> 02:00:23.100
like riding waves one like wouldn't you want to bury?

2211
02:00:24.670 --> 02:00:28.920
<v 2>You have the guy who goes on in front of you and barely gets by for 20 minutes</v>

2212
02:00:28.921 --> 02:00:31.200
or whatever and the crowd gets uncomfortable and then the comic,

2213
02:00:31.230 --> 02:00:35.340
the main event guy comes out and just comes out guns blazing and crushes.

2214
02:00:35.490 --> 02:00:37.700
It makes you look like a fucking superhero.
Yeah,

2215
02:00:38.130 --> 02:00:40.490
the other guy bombed and you just destroyed in.

2216
02:00:40.500 --> 02:00:43.560
There's some guys like that and they need it and the last thing they want to do

2217
02:00:43.561 --> 02:00:46.710
is be in the green room ready to go on and hear some guy out there killing like

2218
02:00:46.860 --> 02:00:49.750
it fucks with them.
They're taking away from my crowd.

2219
02:00:49.850 --> 02:00:52.130
<v 8>There was a comic wouldn't even allow his black comic,</v>

2220
02:00:52.131 --> 02:00:55.280
he wouldn't let our buddy who's a black dude open forum because it was in his

2221
02:00:55.281 --> 02:00:58.520
claws with his manager that no other black comic will go on before me because I

2222
02:00:58.521 --> 02:00:59.354
want to black it up.

2223
02:00:59.360 --> 02:01:02.870
<v 2>Well there was a really funny he got but you still always talk about that on the</v>

2224
02:01:02.871 --> 02:01:03.351
east coast.

2225
02:01:03.351 --> 02:01:07.610
It was funny how if you were to go on the road and there's two white guys and

2226
02:01:07.611 --> 02:01:10.430
one black guy,
the black guy is always like,
yo Yo I was supposed to headline,

2227
02:01:10.460 --> 02:01:14.690
I was supposed to headline but if there's the black guy shows up and there's two

2228
02:01:14.691 --> 02:01:16.490
other black guys like yo I got to go on first,

2229
02:01:16.550 --> 02:01:18.920
I got to go on first because they're doing the same material.

2230
02:01:19.030 --> 02:01:24.030
<v 7>I don't care cause like I haven't heard no black guy say some of the shit that I</v>

2231
02:01:24.491 --> 02:01:29.491
say so I don't care like and even even with some of the comics like you were

2232
02:01:29.711 --> 02:01:32.440
talking about roadwork,
like I'm in Vegas,
the law,

2233
02:01:32.470 --> 02:01:34.990
the next gig that I got booked is for Vegas.

2234
02:01:35.340 --> 02:01:40.340
I like the first week of June I get no work because I'm in that nexus of he's

2235
02:01:41.631 --> 02:01:43.010
not funny enough to headline by us.

2236
02:01:43.510 --> 02:01:47.270
<v 1>I'm going to ask what's your for nobody you sell,
you set yourself up.</v>

2237
02:01:47.480 --> 02:01:51.260
You got like some negative little roadblocks in your head as because down them

2238
02:01:51.261 --> 02:01:51.621
and you like,

2239
02:01:51.621 --> 02:01:54.310
people ain't going to let me and this is going to happen and I got a,

2240
02:01:54.350 --> 02:01:56.960
because people want to fuck with me because you have this,

2241
02:01:57.020 --> 02:01:58.610
you have this little thing in your head.

2242
02:01:58.611 --> 02:02:02.300
You automatically are in conflict with people you like.
People don't want to,

2243
02:02:02.340 --> 02:02:04.280
the people don't want to middle me people don't they?

2244
02:02:04.520 --> 02:02:07.600
You just got to do your shit man.
Don't worry about that.

2245
02:02:07.640 --> 02:02:08.650
The people that are going to,

2246
02:02:08.840 --> 02:02:11.240
the people that are going to be intimidated by you don't dwell on them.

2247
02:02:11.241 --> 02:02:11.900
Don't even,

2248
02:02:11.900 --> 02:02:16.010
<v 7>well I'm not and that's why I think that things are getting better for me as far</v>

2249
02:02:16.011 --> 02:02:18.670
as career wise and mentally wise like it.

2250
02:02:18.680 --> 02:02:20.750
Don't even bring that stuff up in conversation.

2251
02:02:20.751 --> 02:02:24.020
Just abandoned those thoughts that I was talking about just because you asked

2252
02:02:24.021 --> 02:02:26.920
that question,
but what he's holding you back,
man,
that's,
I'm telling you,

2253
02:02:27.100 --> 02:02:28.190
nobody's trying to hold you back.

2254
02:02:28.220 --> 02:02:32.810
I know that because the whole thing is I don't care if they work,

2255
02:02:32.840 --> 02:02:37.190
it's,
it's my job to be the best that I can be on that stage.

2256
02:02:37.220 --> 02:02:39.620
That's all anybody that's all that I can control.

2257
02:02:39.740 --> 02:02:43.160
Like I can't control who wants to take me on the road.

2258
02:02:43.430 --> 02:02:45.380
I can't control who wants to make,

2259
02:02:45.381 --> 02:02:50.381
how many times you've been on the road by myself or do you go on the road a lot?

2260
02:02:50.750 --> 02:02:51.110
No,

2261
02:02:51.110 --> 02:02:55.850
I just worked like books me at his Improv's where's Bud's Improv?

2262
02:02:56.120 --> 02:02:59.630
Oh,
his,
his Vegas and Tahoe.
He still needs still books.
Vegas.
He still was,

2263
02:02:59.680 --> 02:03:04.670
he just retired but saw me one night.
And I guess you're talking about,

2264
02:03:04.671 --> 02:03:05.740
um,
but Friedman,

2265
02:03:05.830 --> 02:03:08.230
<v 1>Bud Freeman,
the legendary guy from the Improv with the Monaco.</v>

2266
02:03:08.231 --> 02:03:09.560
Remember those emails the put on?

2267
02:03:10.050 --> 02:03:10.883
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

2268
02:03:10.950 --> 02:03:15.720
So I play Improv's and I'm like buds and thrives and then I,

2269
02:03:15.721 --> 02:03:19.230
um,
play Vegas Song,
but that's about it,
man.
That's too far.

2270
02:03:19.240 --> 02:03:21.180
As far as me and traveling,
that's about it.

2271
02:03:21.720 --> 02:03:24.670
I really haven't gotten on the road with any,
like,

2272
02:03:24.750 --> 02:03:27.180
I've never worked with anybody on the road on the road.

2273
02:03:27.270 --> 02:03:30.340
<v 1>Oh,
now that you've got the showtime special,
you'd be able to get some gigs,</v>

2274
02:03:30.341 --> 02:03:34.780
right.
Hopefully yet.
Oh,
George Carlin's manager in the showtime special Bro.
Yeah,

2275
02:03:34.781 --> 02:03:37.360
hopefully.
Yeah.
Put it all together.
Hopefully.

2276
02:03:37.390 --> 02:03:40.480
So if people want to get ahold of you,
they get you on Twitter.
Yes,

2277
02:03:40.481 --> 02:03:42.010
Darrell underscore.
Right.

2278
02:03:42.490 --> 02:03:47.170
And Brian is Brian Whittaker and of course red band.
Very weird.

2279
02:03:47.220 --> 02:03:49.210
Ben's very upset of his Twitter follower.

2280
02:03:49.390 --> 02:03:51.850
<v 8>Yeah.
I don't have it so low,
so low.</v>

2281
02:03:51.851 --> 02:03:54.400
I don't get so many people hate me.

2282
02:03:56.050 --> 02:03:57.920
I had a dog collar I today,
Joe,

2283
02:03:57.970 --> 02:04:01.420
I don't know it was going to itself for the girlfriend,

2284
02:04:01.900 --> 02:04:05.740
but it has like 10 levels and like the first level,
you know,
it's very mild.

2285
02:04:05.741 --> 02:04:07.840
And then if it keeps on barking,

2286
02:04:08.130 --> 02:04:10.620
it gets higher and higher and goes after these 10 levels.
Right,
right.

2287
02:04:10.720 --> 02:04:14.950
So we had Ma'am Miller on today's I skeptic tank with Articia fear and we

2288
02:04:14.951 --> 02:04:19.090
decided to like,
Hey,
my Pekinese is wearing this.
It's not going to be that bad.

2289
02:04:19.091 --> 02:04:23.950
So may and puts it around his neck barks and fucking,
he's just like,

2290
02:04:23.951 --> 02:04:26.830
this is awful.
This is awful.
And I'm like,
all right,
are you have to tripe?

2291
02:04:26.890 --> 02:04:30.760
Didn't think that that it went up another level because of that.

2292
02:04:30.790 --> 02:04:33.850
Cause he barked every time we do the kitchen and it had already,

2293
02:04:33.851 --> 02:04:36.790
because my dog had made it go up to like level two or three or something like

2294
02:04:36.791 --> 02:04:38.850
that.
So it was already on like level three.

2295
02:04:38.970 --> 02:04:41.460
Then Ari puts it on right on his throat,
like on his neck.

2296
02:04:41.770 --> 02:04:44.750
Embark's shocks the fuck out.
I'm like,
all right,
it's not that bad.
And,

2297
02:04:44.910 --> 02:04:47.280
but I wasn't going to do it.
I was like,
fuck that you guys,
you know.

2298
02:04:47.340 --> 02:04:48.031
So I was holding,

2299
02:04:48.031 --> 02:04:51.210
I want to hold it and they were laughing so hard and I started laughing that it

2300
02:04:51.211 --> 02:04:55.630
vibrated and it made the noise and shock me,
enhance my hands.
Still fuels numb.

2301
02:04:56.970 --> 02:04:58.090
It's pretty shocked.

2302
02:04:58.530 --> 02:05:02.220
<v 4>It doesn't fucking,
what the Hell's his name?
Um,
Jason.</v>

2303
02:05:02.221 --> 02:05:04.320
Alice doesn't need to like fights were dance.

2304
02:05:04.350 --> 02:05:06.360
We're dog collars and it shocked them remotely.

2305
02:05:06.420 --> 02:05:09.590
<v 8>That's what,
how,
why we decided to do it because the man was talking about,</v>

2306
02:05:09.591 --> 02:05:12.440
he just did it with nick Swardson where they had fights and then they had him

2307
02:05:12.441 --> 02:05:15.180
like wrap it around the all eggs and stuff and which is

2308
02:05:15.470 --> 02:05:19.910
<v 4>via that.
Oh,
just drop dude.
I am not down with that.
Yeah,
those guys are crazy.</v>

2309
02:05:19.920 --> 02:05:23.240
I got played today.
Jason Ellis show.
Yes or nos.
Yeah.

2310
02:05:23.260 --> 02:05:27.160
He's electrocuting themselves.
That's ridiculous.
Why get Ellis on here man?

2311
02:05:27.220 --> 02:05:31.420
I will do.
He was,
I'm supposed to do his show too where we have it in planning.

2312
02:05:32.250 --> 02:05:34.170
Electrocuting it because it's hot man.
Right.

2313
02:05:34.990 --> 02:05:39.560
So next week will be on Monday and Tuesday next week.
Um,

2314
02:05:39.910 --> 02:05:43.690

I almost said filium Philadelphia.

2317
02:05:53.590 --> 02:05:57.460
That's what happens at the end of the show folks.
Your brain is done.

there was only a couple of tickets left for Thursday night late show.

2320
02:06:03.071 --> 02:06:06.040
That was all that was left.
We added a late show Thursday.

2328
02:06:36.411 --> 02:06:39.680
I got somebody who made a fake page on me on Facebook and I checked it yesterday

2329
02:06:39.681 --> 02:06:42.800
and uh,
I was thinking,
oh,
maybe I got some other fans I didn't hear about.

2330
02:06:43.090 --> 02:06:47.180
It was one follower on this fake page.
Wow.
Just so depressing.
It was like,
Damn.

2331
02:06:47.181 --> 02:06:51.200
Somebody made a fake page out of me and I got one fake fan checkout desk.
