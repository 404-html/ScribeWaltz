WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.080
Recording and we're back,

2
00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:05.130
you know,

3
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:05.970
can't get annoyed.

4
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:06.750
Really.

5
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.790
It's amazing that this can even happen at all.

6
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.120
It's amazing that the fucking kitchen table in my office connected to Time

7
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.910
Warner cable or whatever the fuck I've got can do that.

8
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:18.901
That's amazing.

9
00:00:18.901 --> 00:00:19.290
Anyway,

10
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.750
so it's amazing in the first place that this is even possible.

11
00:00:21.751 --> 00:00:25.950
So if every 128th episode,

12
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.740
an audio input fries on the laptop,

13
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.430
I should be fucking amazed at that stupid thing.

14
00:00:32.431 --> 00:00:34.380
Put out a 127 episodes.

15
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:34.561
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

16
00:00:34.561 --> 00:00:37.410
you don't have to have a 200 foot antenna on your roof.

17
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:38.120
It's,

18
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.140
I show up somewhere.

19
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.850
It's like we're like Christian Slater and pump up the volume side

20
00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:43.190
<v 0>to be like,</v>

21
00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.150
like fucking art bell living out there and pull romp Nevada.

22
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.330
You ever seen that guy's house?

23
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.081
Dude?

24
00:00:51.081 --> 00:00:52.410
It's the coolest shit ever.

25
00:00:52.411 --> 00:00:54.580
But our bell is right out of a goddamn movie.

26
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.550
If you don't know who he is.

27
00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.140
Art Bell was the dude who he had this late night radio show.

28
00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:00.861
He still does it,

29
00:01:00.861 --> 00:01:01.700
I think on the weekends.

30
00:01:01.701 --> 00:01:02.534
Right?

31
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.051
But he had it.

32
00:01:03.051 --> 00:01:03.890
He did it every night.

33
00:01:03.891 --> 00:01:08.210
For a while called coast to coast am and you could not shake art bell,

34
00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:09.890
you could call him up art.

35
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.910
I'm aware of Wolf.

36
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.833
Really.

37
00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.220
How long have you been aware of Wolf?

38
00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.300
Who would just go along with that?

39
00:01:15.301 --> 00:01:16.610
But he will never find me.

40
00:01:16.611 --> 00:01:17.121
Come on.

41
00:01:17.121 --> 00:01:20.060
Of course he has questions but he will never questioned you.

42
00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.870
He will,

43
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.470
I mean he will question you who asks you questions but it'll never ridicule you

44
00:01:24.471 --> 00:01:26.360
or cast judgment on your craziness.

45
00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.470
And so because of that,

46
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.470
he would just get one nutty mother fucker after another,

47
00:01:30.471 --> 00:01:35.090
calling him up with crazy predictions and all kinds of nutty shit about the

48
00:01:35.091 --> 00:01:40.091
Mayans and 2012 and mind control and you FO's house for all things,

49
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:42.380
all things crazy.

50
00:01:42.381 --> 00:01:43.580
It was great though.

51
00:01:43.581 --> 00:01:48.140
It's the perfect time to deliver to that shit is when it was on,

52
00:01:48.141 --> 00:01:49.100
it was on from like,

53
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.090
I think 10:00 PM at night until like two in the morning or something like that.

54
00:01:52.091 --> 00:01:55.520
You looks to her bad listener as a kid and just listened to me like the best.

55
00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:56.150
Yeah,

56
00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:57.140
<v 1>like guys like that.</v>

57
00:01:57.141 --> 00:01:57.470
And then,

58
00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:57.900
um,

59
00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:58.280
uh,

60
00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.910
Dr Demento like guys who are just carve out little niches for themselves as

61
00:02:01.911 --> 00:02:02.744
well.

62
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:03.450
For me,

63
00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.910
no,

64
00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:04.820
there's no comparison.

65
00:02:04.821 --> 00:02:05.360
Our bells,

66
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.800
the kangaroo because our belt,

67
00:02:06.801 --> 00:02:09.560
I always knew that I would get some sort of juicy,

68
00:02:09.561 --> 00:02:10.400
crazy talk,

69
00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:10.940
you know,

70
00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.460
that I could be listening to on the way home.

71
00:02:13.461 --> 00:02:15.440
But all the sexy stuff you have folds,

72
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.010
bigfoot,

73
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.910
anything sexy.

74
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.230
Didn't you fall in love with that shit though?

75
00:02:18.231 --> 00:02:18.500
Like A,

76
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.311
and I remember as a kid,

77
00:02:19.311 --> 00:02:20.091
you listened to the radio.

78
00:02:20.091 --> 00:02:22.820
It's like a real intimate thing when you're just listening to something cause

79
00:02:22.821 --> 00:02:25.470
you just go off because all your other senses just chill out and you go off to

80
00:02:25.471 --> 00:02:26.570
another place and you're part of it.

81
00:02:26.571 --> 00:02:28.890
You're in the discussion to the point where you almost saying shit and like why

82
00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:29.773
dance dancer and me,

83
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.090
I think this podcast is just like that too.

84
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.811
It's better.

85
00:02:32.811 --> 00:02:34.730
It's better in audio form I think.

86
00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:35.990
And it's a beeline to,

87
00:02:35.991 --> 00:02:36.770
to the people,

88
00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.720
like there's an intimacy or I'm finding with,

89
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.380
you know,

90
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:40.430
even my podcasts,

91
00:02:40.431 --> 00:02:41.700
like the intimacy and,

92
00:02:41.701 --> 00:02:41.811
and,

93
00:02:41.811 --> 00:02:41.981
and,

94
00:02:41.981 --> 00:02:43.250
and nice plug by the way,

95
00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.920
but he's Lockhart has a podcast on death squad,

96
00:02:45.921 --> 00:02:48.800
squad.tv and it's called a what's good?

97
00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.951
Well,

98
00:02:48.951 --> 00:02:51.010
let's go to the Freddy Lockhart and you've done three of them so far,

99
00:02:51.011 --> 00:02:51.844
right?

100
00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:53.300
But it's like a sun.

101
00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.140
It's like the loyalty of your listeners.

102
00:02:55.141 --> 00:02:56.600
And I'm talking to people from Finland,

103
00:02:56.601 --> 00:02:57.171
Australia.

104
00:02:57.171 --> 00:03:00.070
It's like I never even thought I would even those people,

105
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.800
<v 0>like they're feeling what we're saying and they're sharing things and it's just</v>

106
00:03:02.801 --> 00:03:03.370
like,

107
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.120
it's so cool that we have the ability to do this now.

108
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.720
And it's cool that what we're doing,

109
00:03:07.721 --> 00:03:10.030
the way we're doing it too is that we're all doing it together.

110
00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.530
You know,

111
00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.740
it's,

112
00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:11.573
um,

113
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.580
Brian runs this death squad podcast network and it's all our friends.

114
00:03:15.581 --> 00:03:16.030
It's,

115
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.721
it's Freddie,

116
00:03:16.721 --> 00:03:17.800
it's Thompson Jura.

117
00:03:17.801 --> 00:03:19.090
It's Ari should fear.

118
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:20.920
It's a Sam Tripoli.

119
00:03:20.921 --> 00:03:23.770
It's funny people and it's all funny fucking,

120
00:03:23.771 --> 00:03:25.840
and it's free and it's on all the time.

121
00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.060
And it connects everybody with everybody else.

122
00:03:28.061 --> 00:03:31.630
And everybody gets to know about a guy like Sam Tripoli or know about a guy like

123
00:03:31.631 --> 00:03:32.590
Freddy Loc or Nova,

124
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:37.330
and we get to introduce our fans to each other in a way that you would never be

125
00:03:37.331 --> 00:03:39.790
able to do on morning radio or anything,

126
00:03:39.791 --> 00:03:40.180
man.

127
00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.931
And that's what it's cool.

128
00:03:40.931 --> 00:03:41.320
It's like,

129
00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.960
I would love to get to where you're at to not ever have to do radio again

130
00:03:43.961 --> 00:03:47.080
because it's like you have the most amazing thing ever.

131
00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:48.850
It's never a,

132
00:03:48.851 --> 00:03:51.220
there's never been a time in my career ever.

133
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.400
Or I could sell a theater or a club or just with people that I communicate with

134
00:03:57.131 --> 00:03:59.260
online and it's fun and you don't have fun.

135
00:03:59.261 --> 00:04:02.470
It's fun and it's free and they like it and you're giving them something.

136
00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:03.370
It's for me,

137
00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:05.680
it feels like a real honest exchange.

138
00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.320
Like I liked the fact that it doesn't cost anything.

139
00:04:08.321 --> 00:04:09.890
I want you to just was,

140
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.370
we're having fun and enjoy this shit and,

141
00:04:12.371 --> 00:04:12.790
and,

142
00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:13.031
and,

143
00:04:13.031 --> 00:04:13.331
you know,

144
00:04:13.331 --> 00:04:13.911
and I think it,

145
00:04:13.911 --> 00:04:14.920
it does good.

146
00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:15.230
It's got,

147
00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:15.410
it's,

148
00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.260
it's sets out a good mindset.

149
00:04:17.261 --> 00:04:18.310
It makes when I was a kid,

150
00:04:18.311 --> 00:04:20.890
I always imitated the way other people behaved on TV.

151
00:04:20.891 --> 00:04:21.910
If I thought it was cool,

152
00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.331
you know,

153
00:04:22.331 --> 00:04:24.130
I always wanted to be like that guy.

154
00:04:24.131 --> 00:04:25.360
I wanted to be like this kind of movie.

155
00:04:25.361 --> 00:04:26.530
It's absolutely normal.

156
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:27.191
You know?

157
00:04:27.191 --> 00:04:28.300
And if you,

158
00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.590
if you have a podcast where you can get out there to people,

159
00:04:32.591 --> 00:04:37.120
a way of thinking that's not necessarily mainstream way of thinking,

160
00:04:37.121 --> 00:04:37.954
that's,

161
00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.943
you know,

162
00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.870
thought out by a bunch of really honest,

163
00:04:40.871 --> 00:04:45.520
smart people who have stepped back and really analyze this and compared notes.

164
00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:46.120
You know,

165
00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.751
we've all,

166
00:04:46.751 --> 00:04:49.420
all of us have our different ways about life,

167
00:04:49.421 --> 00:04:50.250
but we all,

168
00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.470
uh,

169
00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:50.891
you know,

170
00:04:50.891 --> 00:04:53.680
one of the cool things about having a group of smart friends is,

171
00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:54.070
you know,

172
00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.400
if say if I want to talk to you about some shit that you experienced,

173
00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.320
some shit that I have no knowledge of.

174
00:04:59.321 --> 00:04:59.620
No.

175
00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.480
I know I can sit down and go,

176
00:05:01.481 --> 00:05:02.170
Freddy,

177
00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.140
tell me about fishing off this p or tell me and you'll,

178
00:05:05.141 --> 00:05:07.990
you'll just give me the straight dope and it'd be like,

179
00:05:07.991 --> 00:05:09.160
I knew it myself,

180
00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:10.150
you know,

181
00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.983
thing in our group.

182
00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.610
I think we all are mindful of,

183
00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:12.940
you know,

184
00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.240
I won't speak about something unless I can speak and tell him.

185
00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.050
We all know that there's actual,

186
00:05:17.051 --> 00:05:20.320
you get benefit from admitting that you don't know something.

187
00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:21.880
And then being honest,

188
00:05:21.881 --> 00:05:26.320
like people respect that in like that way more than you pretending.

189
00:05:26.321 --> 00:05:27.520
You know what you don't know.

190
00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.850
Right.

191
00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:28.540
Oh absolutely.

192
00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:29.650
No benefit to it.

193
00:05:29.651 --> 00:05:29.801
It's,

194
00:05:29.801 --> 00:05:30.001
it's,

195
00:05:30.001 --> 00:05:30.161
it's,

196
00:05:30.161 --> 00:05:30.881
it's a trick.

197
00:05:30.881 --> 00:05:33.970
It's something that you got stuck doing when you were a little kid and you

198
00:05:33.971 --> 00:05:34.804
stayed with it.

199
00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:36.850
None of us do any of that.

200
00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.970
The only time I still lie though is when somebody starts telling me about a

201
00:05:39.971 --> 00:05:40.721
movie and they're like,

202
00:05:40.721 --> 00:05:41.680
did you ever see that one?

203
00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:43.600
I saw just still they'll stop.

204
00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:44.531
So they'll stop.

205
00:05:44.531 --> 00:05:45.940
Cause if you don't cause then they'll tell you.

206
00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:47.470
They'll give you the backstory on it.

207
00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:48.551
Whoops.

208
00:05:48.551 --> 00:05:49.384
Was that me?

209
00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:50.693
Yeah,

210
00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:51.753
it works.

211
00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.913
Sound good?

212
00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:54.490
No,

213
00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:55.390
but always complaining.

214
00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:57.123
Yup.

215
00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:57.741
That's crazy.

216
00:05:57.741 --> 00:05:59.150
As this was laptop the whole time.

217
00:05:59.230 --> 00:05:59.490
Yeah.

218
00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:01.580
Well we had a buzzing noise at one episode.

219
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:03.760
Length should be amazed at that fucking piece of shit.

220
00:06:03.761 --> 00:06:05.900
That little 13 inch wonky one.

221
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.500
Yeah.

222
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:06.920
And we,

223
00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:07.221
you know,

224
00:06:07.221 --> 00:06:11.990
there's gotta be some bad Karma to the fact that these people that are making

225
00:06:11.991 --> 00:06:16.190
these laptops and computers are all working in these factories where they have

226
00:06:16.191 --> 00:06:19.280
dormitories and fucking suicide nets all over the place.

227
00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:20.511
Have you seen that shit,

228
00:06:20.511 --> 00:06:21.050
man,

229
00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.501
that's got,

230
00:06:21.501 --> 00:06:21.650
um,

231
00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:23.060
does that freak you out man,

232
00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:23.930
it freaked me out.

233
00:06:23.931 --> 00:06:24.111
I mean,

234
00:06:24.111 --> 00:06:24.861
I know that they say,

235
00:06:24.861 --> 00:06:25.041
well,

236
00:06:25.041 --> 00:06:26.960
these have the best work conditions and you know,

237
00:06:26.961 --> 00:06:28.250
we've provided them with counseling.

238
00:06:28.251 --> 00:06:28.431
Look,

239
00:06:28.431 --> 00:06:29.810
they have a billiards hall to play in.

240
00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:33.080
They still seem like slaves still seems something crazy.

241
00:06:33.081 --> 00:06:36.200
You got a bunch of people living in a warehouse and then they're working x

242
00:06:36.201 --> 00:06:40.460
amount of hours a day for fucking 25 cents an hour or something crazy like that.

243
00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:40.821
Their lives.

244
00:06:40.821 --> 00:06:41.631
What are they getting paid?

245
00:06:41.631 --> 00:06:42.690
Turning a product and that,

246
00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:43.130
yeah,

247
00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:44.870
it's weird whether you're paid or not.

248
00:06:44.871 --> 00:06:46.730
If your life is devoted to making a product,

249
00:06:46.731 --> 00:06:49.010
if you're now an industrialized part of machinery,

250
00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:49.791
you know what I mean?

251
00:06:49.791 --> 00:06:50.090
That's,

252
00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:50.930
you're a slave.

253
00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:51.131
You're,

254
00:06:51.131 --> 00:06:51.440
you're,

255
00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:52.190
you're enslaved.

256
00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:53.660
W willing workers who,

257
00:06:53.661 --> 00:06:54.530
where there's no work.

258
00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:55.610
See in America,

259
00:06:55.611 --> 00:06:59.630
we have a lot of really fucking shit jobs that nobody wants.

260
00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:00.231
But in,

261
00:07:00.231 --> 00:07:01.070
in China,

262
00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:04.490
I think the difference is when you get to like around a billion people,

263
00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:08.480
there's places where there's no options and these people were willing workers,

264
00:07:08.481 --> 00:07:09.111
but they're really,

265
00:07:09.111 --> 00:07:09.381
their,

266
00:07:09.381 --> 00:07:11.240
their environment sucks so bad.

267
00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.850
There's no options but to work for these factories.

268
00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:15.001
And so they,

269
00:07:15.001 --> 00:07:16.490
they're forced into that situation.

270
00:07:16.491 --> 00:07:17.870
It's not sort of like America,

271
00:07:17.871 --> 00:07:19.850
there's more opportunity to move around.

272
00:07:19.851 --> 00:07:20.930
There's more different shit,

273
00:07:20.931 --> 00:07:21.680
more variety,

274
00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:22.580
at least as far as,

275
00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.290
as China has been explained to me.

276
00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:24.620
You know,

277
00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:27.870
there's like terribly poor places that are just frightening.

278
00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:28.221
No,

279
00:07:28.221 --> 00:07:29.030
I've never been there.

280
00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:31.490
But there's also incredible amount of rich people too.

281
00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:35.360
Someone said that in Shanghai there's over a hundred thousand millionaires.

282
00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:36.321
I believe it.

283
00:07:36.321 --> 00:07:37.880
There's 28 million people live in there.

284
00:07:37.881 --> 00:07:39.200
So it's like per capita that's,

285
00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.900
we have 100,000 millionaires.

286
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:42.800
And you know,

287
00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.630
the thing about China too is the,

288
00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:48.440
the big point is they are not trying to take over the world.

289
00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:50.060
They're trying to sell you shit.

290
00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:50.811
Okay?

291
00:07:50.811 --> 00:07:51.860
They're trying to make money.

292
00:07:51.861 --> 00:07:53.090
They're trying to do business.

293
00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.200
That's what they're trying to do.

294
00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:56.390
The Chinese aren't trying to take over the world.

295
00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:57.200
You know,

296
00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.510
they've had their issues with ty.

297
00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:00.620
They've had their issues with,

298
00:08:00.621 --> 00:08:00.860
uh,

299
00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:01.250
with,

300
00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:03.200
with Thailand and they've had their issues with,

301
00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:03.801
you know,

302
00:08:03.801 --> 00:08:04.010
uh,

303
00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:04.360
with,

304
00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:05.120
um,

305
00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:07.190
where's the Dalai Lama from Tibet.

306
00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:07.800
Tibet.

307
00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:08.633
Sorry to be,

308
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:10.101
yeah,

309
00:08:10.101 --> 00:08:11.540
there's a lot of shit with Tibet,

310
00:08:11.541 --> 00:08:11.720
right?

311
00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:13.290
There's always a free Tibet bumper sticker.

312
00:08:13.291 --> 00:08:15.680
So China's not innocent in a abroad,

313
00:08:15.681 --> 00:08:20.681
but when you look at like how much we're involved in shit in other parts of the

314
00:08:20.991 --> 00:08:21.824
world,

315
00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:22.680
he just,

316
00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:25.760
the economic impact of all this fucking military action.

317
00:08:25.761 --> 00:08:27.080
It's staggering.

318
00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:27.680
You know,

319
00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:28.700
we don't consider it and we say,

320
00:08:28.701 --> 00:08:28.880
Oh,

321
00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:29.910
look at China blowing up.

322
00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:30.031
Well,

323
00:08:30.031 --> 00:08:30.864
you're trying to blow it up.

324
00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:33.980
It doesn't have to worry about fucking taken over the world.

325
00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:35.210
China doesn't have to worry about that.

326
00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:35.540
China,

327
00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:36.070
China doesn't,

328
00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:36.321
you know,

329
00:08:36.321 --> 00:08:38.300
they're not invested and I mean a little bit.

330
00:08:38.301 --> 00:08:39.020
I'm sure they are,

331
00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:40.970
but they're not invested nearly as much as we are.

332
00:08:40.971 --> 00:08:41.540
And this shit.

333
00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:41.691
Well,

334
00:08:41.691 --> 00:08:44.930
I think they take into the old school way of thinking was it's like even in the

335
00:08:44.931 --> 00:08:47.690
fourth it's like he with the nukes is the winner,

336
00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.090
but what they've realized is this is the new era.

337
00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:51.200
We all got nukes.

338
00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:51.771
You know what I mean?

339
00:08:51.771 --> 00:08:52.461
You pull the trigger,

340
00:08:52.461 --> 00:08:53.390
we're all going down.

341
00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:57.000
So the way to get ahead is to be an economical superpower.

342
00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:02.060
It's fucking truly amazing that that's how it's still run in 2011 it really is

343
00:09:02.131 --> 00:09:04.200
like a weapon that can kill you thing.

344
00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:04.960
The handle a weapon.

345
00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:05.220
It's,

346
00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:05.420
well,

347
00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:06.061
it's not just that.

348
00:09:06.061 --> 00:09:07.560
I mean it always was a weapon that can kill you.

349
00:09:07.561 --> 00:09:09.030
It used to be I had a sword and then it was,

350
00:09:09.031 --> 00:09:09.691
I have a spear.

351
00:09:09.691 --> 00:09:11.850
Then as I have a canon and it's still,

352
00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:13.410
I have some shit that will kill you.

353
00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:14.190
It's still,

354
00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:16.750
I mean basically it's the same dynamic.

355
00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:18.870
All comes down to that one carnal instinct.

356
00:09:18.871 --> 00:09:19.704
I'll kill you.

357
00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:22.230
It's amazing control of resources.

358
00:09:22.231 --> 00:09:23.010
I'll kill you.

359
00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:23.910
Give me the resources,

360
00:09:23.911 --> 00:09:25.500
I'll fucking kill you if you're the shit.

361
00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:26.371
It's amazing.

362
00:09:26.371 --> 00:09:31.371
Now 2011 I wonder if it's going to be able to continue this way because it seems

363
00:09:32.341 --> 00:09:36.190
like the tolerance that people have for it today is,

364
00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.170
is very short.

365
00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:40.020
It's very different than it was a few decades ago.

366
00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:41.910
Did very different than it was before the Internet.

367
00:09:41.911 --> 00:09:42.181
To me,

368
00:09:42.181 --> 00:09:47.110
I think people think of war as much more distasteful people or if anyone is

369
00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:50.670
likely to buy into any wacky conspiracy theory.

370
00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:55.740
The big one would be that the military industrial complex has their fingers in

371
00:09:55.741 --> 00:09:58.230
all parts of the world for making money and they force wars.

372
00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:00.180
It sounds crazy,

373
00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:03.740
but if you look at Eisenhower's speech and if you look at all the evidence that

374
00:10:03.741 --> 00:10:04.950
that's exactly what they do,

375
00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:08.280
that's a conspiracy that more people would be willing to buy.

376
00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:08.490
Right?

377
00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:10.410
That almost any other wacky conspiracy,

378
00:10:10.411 --> 00:10:11.430
that war is big business.

379
00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:12.450
Of course we forced them.

380
00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:13.770
That's a fringe idea,

381
00:10:13.771 --> 00:10:14.041
man.

382
00:10:14.041 --> 00:10:17.400
I mean that's not something that you could bring up on CBS news and they'll just

383
00:10:17.401 --> 00:10:18.510
let you slide with that.

384
00:10:18.511 --> 00:10:19.080
You know,

385
00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:20.880
the challenge is it's a fringe idea,

386
00:10:20.881 --> 00:10:21.890
but it's one of these things where I,

387
00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:25.140
is it so much fringe or just unpopular as popular to say on TV,

388
00:10:25.141 --> 00:10:26.820
it's unpopular to look at reality.

389
00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:27.571
It's unpopular.

390
00:10:27.571 --> 00:10:31.410
Look that we are living inside the balls of the Dick that's fucking the world

391
00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.000
and that's what's going down.

392
00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:33.150
Well,

393
00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:34.270
people don't want to know that.

394
00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:35.700
They don't want to think about it.

395
00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:37.290
They want to thank USA USA.

396
00:10:37.291 --> 00:10:38.490
They don't want to think of what does that mean?

397
00:10:38.491 --> 00:10:38.671
Yeah.

398
00:10:38.671 --> 00:10:39.180
You,

399
00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:39.600
yes.

400
00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.520
If you and USAA and main USA,

401
00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:42.690
you're talking about dudes,

402
00:10:42.691 --> 00:10:42.900
right?

403
00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:47.900
Bad ass books and dudes who sing great songs and people who make bad ass houses

404
00:10:48.721 --> 00:10:52.710
and real American ingenuity and craftsmanship and construction.

405
00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:53.370
Yes.

406
00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:53.760
Yes.

407
00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:54.560
Go USA,

408
00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:54.730
right?

409
00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:55.080
Yeah.

410
00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:55.330
Yeah.

411
00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:56.071
Go Go.

412
00:10:56.071 --> 00:10:58.740
All the comics that have ever come out of America go,

413
00:10:58.741 --> 00:11:00.690
all of the movie makers go on.

414
00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:01.021
I mean,

415
00:11:01.021 --> 00:11:02.190
you want to talk creativity.

416
00:11:02.191 --> 00:11:06.870
There's brilliant artists all over the world or what a fucking pool of on there

417
00:11:06.871 --> 00:11:07.810
are here with a Mac.

418
00:11:07.811 --> 00:11:07.940
What?

419
00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:09.540
What an amazing fucking country.

420
00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:11.160
This is this,

421
00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:12.630
but not the military.

422
00:11:12.631 --> 00:11:14.220
That fucking runs our shit,

423
00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:15.001
not them.

424
00:11:15.001 --> 00:11:15.631
They're not us.

425
00:11:15.631 --> 00:11:16.440
That's money.

426
00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:17.041
That's all.

427
00:11:17.041 --> 00:11:18.570
What that is is a virus.

428
00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:23.040
It's a virus that runs on money and that virus is killing people left and right,

429
00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.170
and it might as well be a fucking disease.

430
00:11:25.171 --> 00:11:29.130
It might as well be the plague or super aids or gonorrhea,

431
00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:31.860
but it's a fucking virus and that virus is,

432
00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:32.850
it needs money.

433
00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:35.850
It's a virus fueled by money and it's willing to kill.

434
00:11:35.851 --> 00:11:37.950
But how much of a of our budget do we,

435
00:11:37.951 --> 00:11:38.221
a lot.

436
00:11:38.221 --> 00:11:41.880
So it's a huge amounts of money and then an absurd amount.

437
00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:44.490
If we kind a quarter of it,

438
00:11:44.491 --> 00:11:46.320
like we'd be doing completely fine too.

439
00:11:46.321 --> 00:11:47.070
Whatever arenas.

440
00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:47.550
A lot.

441
00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:48.750
It doesn't make any sense.

442
00:11:48.751 --> 00:11:50.190
And it's like we're addicted to it.

443
00:11:50.191 --> 00:11:51.570
We're addicted to be in these,

444
00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:52.770
in these conflicts.

445
00:11:52.771 --> 00:11:53.501
It really is.

446
00:11:53.501 --> 00:11:54.670
Like Eisenhower said,

447
00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:57.640
Eisenhower predicted this shit and whatever the fuck it was,

448
00:11:57.641 --> 00:11:58.510
1950

449
00:11:59.140 --> 00:11:59.770
<v 2>the the,</v>

450
00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:00.760
there was a FDR.

451
00:12:00.761 --> 00:12:03.190
People always said too that he was trying to keep us out of World War II,

452
00:12:03.191 --> 00:12:04.510
but that wasn't the case at all.

453
00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:09.010
He made one real poignant speech even before the chaps that attacked Pearl

454
00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:10.330
Harbor and he said something like,

455
00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:11.290
if we don't,

456
00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.170
we can't rest on our laurels and,

457
00:12:13.171 --> 00:12:13.331
and,

458
00:12:13.331 --> 00:12:14.800
and this is a summation,

459
00:12:14.801 --> 00:12:17.800
but we can't rest on our laurels and relaxed here in our own country.

460
00:12:17.801 --> 00:12:18.930
We have to go find it.

461
00:12:18.931 --> 00:12:22.240
Povey opposing flows overseas if we want to feel safe here.

462
00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:23.320
Which was basically like,

463
00:12:23.321 --> 00:12:23.471
hey,

464
00:12:23.471 --> 00:12:24.221
prepare America.

465
00:12:24.221 --> 00:12:25.300
This is big business,

466
00:12:25.301 --> 00:12:26.134
this fucking war.

467
00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:26.950
And it was,

468
00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:28.120
it was big business.

469
00:12:28.121 --> 00:12:28.700
It made us,

470
00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:30.590
it gave us money and invented the suburbs.

471
00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:32.590
It was huge fucking business that war,

472
00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:34.270
war bonds and all that shit.

473
00:12:34.271 --> 00:12:37.330
But it's like now it's not a lucrative business like it used to be.

474
00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:38.740
What's lucrative is the contracts,

475
00:12:38.741 --> 00:12:41.980
they get to build the shit they get to justify the money they're going to spend

476
00:12:41.981 --> 00:12:42.790
next year.

477
00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:46.180
So it's like we keep giving all this fucking money to this thing for that sky is

478
00:12:46.181 --> 00:12:48.010
falling thing when the sky isn't falling.

479
00:12:48.011 --> 00:12:51.850
There was that movie gung Ho with Michael Keaton member that 1996 and there was

480
00:12:51.851 --> 00:12:55.330
a quote in there and he said the American spirit is alive and alive and well

481
00:12:55.331 --> 00:12:56.800
it's just in Hong Kong right now.

482
00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:58.240
And it's like that was,

483
00:12:58.270 --> 00:12:58.540
you know,

484
00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:02.350
it was very prophetic because it is because over in China they're just like,

485
00:13:02.351 --> 00:13:02.681
you know what?

486
00:13:02.681 --> 00:13:03.401
Let's build shit.

487
00:13:03.401 --> 00:13:03.851
Let's be,

488
00:13:03.851 --> 00:13:04.930
let's just make shit.

489
00:13:04.931 --> 00:13:07.300
Let's keep fucking making it like we used to do.

490
00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:08.191
<v 0>You know?</v>

491
00:13:08.191 --> 00:13:12.180
And the most disappointing part about it is that a lot of these guys,

492
00:13:12.181 --> 00:13:13.140
a lot of the troops,

493
00:13:13.141 --> 00:13:14.130
a lot of the people that are,

494
00:13:14.131 --> 00:13:16.260
that are all working for,

495
00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:16.831
you know,

496
00:13:16.831 --> 00:13:18.510
what they believe is a good cause.

497
00:13:18.511 --> 00:13:18.871
You know,

498
00:13:18.871 --> 00:13:19.320
these are,

499
00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:20.490
these are real heroes,

500
00:13:20.491 --> 00:13:21.030
man.

501
00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:24.340
I mean there are some real fucking heroes in this country volunteering,

502
00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:28.020
willing to go to other parts of the world to protect the people that are back

503
00:13:28.021 --> 00:13:28.201
here.

504
00:13:28.201 --> 00:13:29.040
That's legit.

505
00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:29.490
Yeah,

506
00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:30.690
they're legit heroes.

507
00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:33.540
They're just getting used by people with bad intentions.

508
00:13:33.541 --> 00:13:35.600
Shirts this as clearly as as it is today.

509
00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:37.060
People are doing their bidding there.

510
00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:39.960
There's no doubt the American military is fucking amazing.

511
00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:43.230
If they were just used for defense and just used,

512
00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:43.561
you know,

513
00:13:43.561 --> 00:13:44.220
for good,

514
00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:46.200
it would be the most incredible force ever.

515
00:13:46.201 --> 00:13:46.731
I think our,

516
00:13:46.731 --> 00:13:47.564
our hall

517
00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:52.070
<v 2>I our biggest asset as we can bring war to any corner of the globe and in less</v>

518
00:13:52.071 --> 00:13:53.000
than 24 hours,

519
00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:54.173
you're done.

520
00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:55.340
We don't have the biggest,

521
00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:56.090
we just got,

522
00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:57.540
we got the biggest weapons and we got it.

523
00:13:57.550 --> 00:13:57.700
We

524
00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:58.533
<v 0>can have everything.</v>

525
00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:01.150
We got military in over a hundred countries.

526
00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:02.220
Our installments were,

527
00:14:02.221 --> 00:14:04.030
we were like France used to be Nigga,

528
00:14:04.031 --> 00:14:04.870
we everywhere.

529
00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:06.550
It's more than ridiculous.

530
00:14:06.551 --> 00:14:07.840
No one's ever been like this.

531
00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:10.150
No one's ever had this kind of presence in the world.

532
00:14:10.151 --> 00:14:10.331
I mean,

533
00:14:10.331 --> 00:14:11.920
this is the United States of the world.

534
00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:12.570
That's what it is.

535
00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:12.850
Yeah.

536
00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:16.120
Everybody else is like our little buddy who's our neighbor who yells at us,

537
00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:17.050
but you know,

538
00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:18.460
he knows that will burn this fucking house.

539
00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:19.240
Yeah.

540
00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:19.601
You put,

541
00:14:19.601 --> 00:14:20.140
you know what it is.

542
00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:20.450
We're,

543
00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:23.170
we're a compilation of all of them and act like where these elitist,

544
00:14:23.171 --> 00:14:23.921
separatist and all that,

545
00:14:23.921 --> 00:14:25.900
but we're the where they all start lineup of the world.

546
00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:26.330
Well,

547
00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:30.730
we're the end of the line as far as like people that wanted to take shit to the

548
00:14:30.731 --> 00:14:31.470
next level.

549
00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:32.141
That's what happened.

550
00:14:32.141 --> 00:14:33.460
They were in Europe and they're like,

551
00:14:33.461 --> 00:14:34.780
this ain't working for me.

552
00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:38.290
I'm going to get out of fucking boat and fly to some unknown land.

553
00:14:38.291 --> 00:14:38.800
Yeah,

554
00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:39.380
so those,

555
00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:40.330
that genetics,

556
00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:40.511
the,

557
00:14:40.511 --> 00:14:41.650
those are the freaks.

558
00:14:41.651 --> 00:14:42.970
Those are the crazy assholes.

559
00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:43.601
You know?

560
00:14:43.601 --> 00:14:44.434
It's like,

561
00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:44.951
I mean,

562
00:14:44.951 --> 00:14:46.560
Australia is a bad ass country.

563
00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:48.220
One of the reasons why it's a bad ass countries.

564
00:14:48.221 --> 00:14:51.010
It started out a God damn prison colony because a logo a lot.

565
00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:52.010
Those people are like the

566
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:54.350
<v 1>grandparents and the grandchildren and great,</v>

567
00:14:54.351 --> 00:14:54.561
great,

568
00:14:54.561 --> 00:14:54.771
great,

569
00:14:54.771 --> 00:14:58.160
great grandchildren of fucking crazy criminals from England.

570
00:14:58.430 --> 00:14:59.051
They got rid of it.

571
00:14:59.051 --> 00:14:59.900
Get the fuck out of here.

572
00:14:59.901 --> 00:15:00.661
You crazy as hell.

573
00:15:00.661 --> 00:15:02.000
We're going to send you to an island,

574
00:15:02.001 --> 00:15:04.070
but which is so far away you can never get back to us.

575
00:15:04.071 --> 00:15:04.311
Okay?

576
00:15:04.311 --> 00:15:05.144
We don't want to kill you.

577
00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:06.200
Just get the fuck out of here.

578
00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:09.380
You'll have a skewed accent and everything while they're awesome.

579
00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:10.840
They're really is amazing.

580
00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:12.370
Most well traveled people in the world.

581
00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:12.770
Aussies,

582
00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:14.570
I think because they have to travel to go anywhere,

583
00:15:14.571 --> 00:15:15.860
but it's like everywhere they go.

584
00:15:15.861 --> 00:15:16.221
And they was like,

585
00:15:16.221 --> 00:15:16.691
I'm going to stay.

586
00:15:16.691 --> 00:15:18.720
And you catch Mankin and be here for six weeks.

587
00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:19.220
Yeah.

588
00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:19.910
Oh,

589
00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:22.730
we were in Hawaii and there was a couple from,

590
00:15:22.731 --> 00:15:23.060
uh,

591
00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:23.510
from,

592
00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:24.320
from um,

593
00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:24.951
Australia.

594
00:15:24.951 --> 00:15:25.784
They were from Melbourne,

595
00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:26.653
Melbourne,

596
00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:27.231
Melbourne,

597
00:15:27.231 --> 00:15:29.180
and they took the kids out as a long flight.

598
00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:29.571
You know,

599
00:15:29.571 --> 00:15:32.870
they had a fly like 11 hours and then two hours and you know,

600
00:15:32.871 --> 00:15:33.704
it's like,

601
00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:34.790
oh,

602
00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:35.840
fucking just do it man.

603
00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:38.510
Just the friendliest people in the world really are well traveled.

604
00:15:38.511 --> 00:15:39.344
Lanes are amazing,

605
00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:39.771
friendly.

606
00:15:39.771 --> 00:15:42.450
And I think something like 80% of Australia is uninhabited.

607
00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:43.340
Uninhabitable.

608
00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:44.270
Uninhabitable.

609
00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:44.740
Well,

610
00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:44.990
yeah.

611
00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:46.360
It's just put the places that you can't.

612
00:15:46.361 --> 00:15:47.194
Perth,

613
00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:48.253
Sydney,

614
00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:49.430
Melbourne,

615
00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:51.800
like the places you can live are fucking phenomenal.

616
00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:54.250
But I also heard it's the most deadly place on earth.

617
00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:58.370
You can get killed by more insects and indigenous creatures.

618
00:15:58.430 --> 00:15:59.263
They're

619
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:00.921
jellyfish,

620
00:16:00.921 --> 00:16:01.561
jellyfish,

621
00:16:01.561 --> 00:16:02.060
sting rays.

622
00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:03.290
They have a certain jellyfish,

623
00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:04.610
I want to say man of war,

624
00:16:04.611 --> 00:16:05.391
but I think I'm wrong.

625
00:16:05.391 --> 00:16:06.320
I don't think that's the name of it.

626
00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:06.600
There's a,

627
00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:07.490
there's a name for it.

628
00:16:07.491 --> 00:16:08.630
I'm not sure what the jellyfish is,

629
00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:13.780
but a really super toxic one where almost 90% of the people that get hit by this

630
00:16:13.941 --> 00:16:14.774
thing tie.

631
00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:19.940
You got to get treatment like within seconds and they have these giant jugs of

632
00:16:19.941 --> 00:16:21.380
vinegar that they keep in,

633
00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:21.680
um,

634
00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:26.680
like little boxes all around the beach in case people get hit by a jellyfish to

635
00:16:27.111 --> 00:16:29.030
pour this vinegar on them somehow or another.

636
00:16:29.031 --> 00:16:30.800
It's like lessens the impact.

637
00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:34.670
But the f jellyfish are fucking ferocious there.

638
00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:36.560
Toxins are so ruthless,

639
00:16:36.561 --> 00:16:38.000
whatever this jellyfish is just,

640
00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:39.410
it just jacks people.

641
00:16:39.411 --> 00:16:41.150
This one lady was scarred the fuck up.

642
00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:42.480
Is it a box jellyfish?

643
00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:42.711
Yeah,

644
00:16:42.711 --> 00:16:43.320
I think that is,

645
00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:44.660
it was one lady,

646
00:16:44.661 --> 00:16:45.494
her legs.

647
00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:46.820
She made it through,

648
00:16:46.821 --> 00:16:48.590
but her legs were just mangled.

649
00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:49.760
Do you swim in the seat?

650
00:16:49.761 --> 00:16:50.594
Do you get in that way?

651
00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:52.370
That shit son.

652
00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:55.130
I get close to the shore and a boogie board.

653
00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:56.910
If I'm feeling frisky hemp,

654
00:16:56.930 --> 00:16:58.730
would it be to have a jelly fish though?

655
00:16:58.731 --> 00:17:02.150
And when it was black light aquariums in the middle of your living room,

656
00:17:02.151 --> 00:17:04.970
that's like nature's Joe Lava and I get real,

657
00:17:04.971 --> 00:17:08.330
my eyes are very sensitive and when I get saltwater and then it burns like fuck.

658
00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:10.220
I think it's because when I did fear factor a lot,

659
00:17:10.221 --> 00:17:13.310
I had a lot of sunscreen going in my eyes.

660
00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:14.480
It happened many times.

661
00:17:14.690 --> 00:17:15.271
I remember that.

662
00:17:15.271 --> 00:17:15.390
I mean,

663
00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:15.660
yeah,

664
00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:17.630
a bunch of times where I was like on stage and this,

665
00:17:17.830 --> 00:17:20.030
but my sweat from my forehead while being on stage,

666
00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:23.600
the sunscreen would leak into my eyes and it's like I fried my retinas or

667
00:17:23.601 --> 00:17:24.050
something.

668
00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:24.230
Oh,

669
00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:24.800
it's like I,

670
00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:27.450
my eyes are much more sensitive now to salt water.

671
00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:28.550
Yeah.

672
00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:30.050
I think I fucked him up from my boss.

673
00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:31.040
I can't see good.

674
00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:33.170
But I think they're much more sensitive now.

675
00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:34.580
I could tear up real easy.

676
00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:36.740
So I had to wear like goggles and shit like that.

677
00:17:36.741 --> 00:17:37.640
But the,

678
00:17:37.641 --> 00:17:37.760
uh,

679
00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:41.180
the idea that there's some shit out there that can kill you and it does every

680
00:17:41.181 --> 00:17:44.300
now and then every year someone gets bit somewhere and you don't want to get got

681
00:17:44.301 --> 00:17:45.140
by a fish.

682
00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:47.570
Got got a year ago right out here.

683
00:17:47.571 --> 00:17:49.030
Santa Barbara by a jellyfish.

684
00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:49.890
No fucking shark.

685
00:17:49.891 --> 00:17:50.610
Bit them in half.

686
00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:51.180
Oh Wow.

687
00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:51.570
Wow.

688
00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:51.811
Yeah.

689
00:17:51.811 --> 00:17:54.450
And they found a great white really recently around Malibu.

690
00:17:54.451 --> 00:17:55.710
They spot it from a plane.

691
00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:58.230
There's a great white tooling around Malibu,

692
00:17:58.270 --> 00:17:59.100
chief rowdy 10.

693
00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:00.240
Most of these beaches down.

694
00:18:00.241 --> 00:18:00.900
Listen man,

695
00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:02.250
they're out there.

696
00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:03.103
They're there.

697
00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:06.720
They're just a big muscle swimming and fucking Australia.

698
00:18:06.721 --> 00:18:07.441
There's everything.

699
00:18:07.441 --> 00:18:08.460
There's crocodiles.

700
00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:12.930
Crocodiles are easily the scariest fucking thing on the planet for me.

701
00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:14.310
Even more scary than sharks.

702
00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:15.540
Yeah,

703
00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:17.640
because I don't fucking go in the water that much,

704
00:18:17.641 --> 00:18:17.881
man.

705
00:18:17.881 --> 00:18:19.260
So sharks are scary and shit,

706
00:18:19.261 --> 00:18:20.340
but I know they're out there,

707
00:18:20.341 --> 00:18:21.250
so I'm cool.

708
00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:21.690
I'll,

709
00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:23.160
I'll take less chances over here.

710
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:24.510
You know,

711
00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:29.310
the idea that you jump into their world and it just subject to their rules and

712
00:18:29.311 --> 00:18:31.560
their laws and crocodiles live in our world.

713
00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:34.710
I think like they exist.

714
00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:38.220
You ever see the one picture of the crocodile hunter holding his baby and

715
00:18:38.221 --> 00:18:39.480
feeding of a crocodile,

716
00:18:39.481 --> 00:18:42.960
a chicken that the most irresponsible.

717
00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:45.600
I didn't have children when I first saw that photo.

718
00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:46.590
I didn't have,

719
00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:49.110
it had never reproduced,

720
00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:49.440
right?

721
00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:51.150
So to me it was just a norm.

722
00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:53.610
It was just a logical thing like,

723
00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:54.421
well that's ridiculous.

724
00:18:54.421 --> 00:18:55.090
Why is he doing that?

725
00:18:55.090 --> 00:18:56.760
That's crazy with his kid got hurt.

726
00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:00.810
But when you have children and you think about the idea that just for a goof,

727
00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:05.520
you will stand in front of this fucking unpredictable Munster and take some,

728
00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:08.680
maybe it's one out of a thousand chance you're willing to do that.

729
00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:13.420
What if your kid got eaten by a fucking crocodile right in front of you and

730
00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:14.370
you're the crocodile hunter?

731
00:19:14.371 --> 00:19:16.230
That would make you sound very bad at your job.

732
00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:20.490
What if something happened and it's stumbled as you were giving it the chicken

733
00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:23.910
and the chicken bounced out of it's mouth and it looked at the baby and said,

734
00:19:23.911 --> 00:19:25.020
I'll go for this next.

735
00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:28.590
And it pulls your arms off with the fucking baby and it does.

736
00:19:28.591 --> 00:19:29.940
The role does a death row.

737
00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:30.961
And just snap,

738
00:19:30.961 --> 00:19:31.231
snap,

739
00:19:31.231 --> 00:19:35.100
snap and your elbows fucking pop off and he started shooting like a sprinkler.

740
00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:36.580
You watched it,

741
00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:37.620
you watch the swamp people,

742
00:19:37.621 --> 00:19:38.580
you've seen them out there?

743
00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:38.821
Yeah,

744
00:19:38.821 --> 00:19:41.970
with the to check their traps and stuff and then they just point blank shoot him

745
00:19:41.971 --> 00:19:45.900
in the face with a gun and that's to bring them back in and they're looking for

746
00:19:45.901 --> 00:19:47.610
like 12 footers like me and eat them.

747
00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:48.271
Yeah,

748
00:19:48.271 --> 00:19:51.100
I it's delicious and make nice boots and all that stuff too.

749
00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:55.440
But those guys hunting for them a crazy dude that's a wild monster that you're

750
00:19:55.441 --> 00:19:57.510
out there shooting and alligators are pussies.

751
00:19:57.660 --> 00:19:59.640
They're like poodles compared to pit bulls.

752
00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:01.740
When you compare like an alligator to a crocodile,

753
00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:03.390
crocodiles are way more ferocious,

754
00:20:03.391 --> 00:20:04.081
way crazier,

755
00:20:04.081 --> 00:20:04.914
way meaner,

756
00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:05.910
way more dangerous.

757
00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:06.451
We quicker,

758
00:20:06.451 --> 00:20:08.420
it's just one of those things where you let your mind absorb it.

759
00:20:08.421 --> 00:20:08.791
It's like wow,

760
00:20:08.791 --> 00:20:11.520
that exists among footers man.

761
00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:12.420
How about they don't,

762
00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:14.950
they can hold their breath for like a couple hours.

763
00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:15.600
Just killers.

764
00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:18.360
They can get into like a pond and go underwater.

765
00:20:18.361 --> 00:20:22.050
It just sit there and not move for a couple hours and they look mean as fuck.

766
00:20:22.051 --> 00:20:23.220
They don't look like well-wishers.

767
00:20:23.221 --> 00:20:24.840
They look like they're here to fuck shit up.

768
00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:27.930
He looks meaner than a fucking crack and it looks like teeth are all up and

769
00:20:27.931 --> 00:20:28.441
down.

770
00:20:28.441 --> 00:20:29.241
They look fake.

771
00:20:29.241 --> 00:20:31.650
It's like you sit here and tell kids there's no such thing as monsters.

772
00:20:31.651 --> 00:20:32.610
What if you live in Florida?

773
00:20:32.611 --> 00:20:32.851
Yeah,

774
00:20:32.851 --> 00:20:34.390
there is fucking her in Florida.

775
00:20:34.391 --> 00:20:35.340
And that was under your bed.

776
00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:37.290
What are those deep water fish?

777
00:20:37.291 --> 00:20:40.350
They have like the fangs and the eye and had that thing that uh,

778
00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:41.213
like an intense,

779
00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:42.710
it's almost like,

780
00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:42.870
oh,

781
00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:43.650
I know what you're talking about.

782
00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:44.100
It almost like,

783
00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:45.450
I think it's called the Angler fish.

784
00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:48.250
It has like it's own fake swimming fishing rod.

785
00:20:48.251 --> 00:20:48.611
Sure.

786
00:20:48.611 --> 00:20:49.081
I know what you mean.

787
00:20:49.081 --> 00:20:49.361
Yeah.

788
00:20:49.361 --> 00:20:52.570
And it looks like it looks like a lure in front of them and they fish come near

789
00:20:52.571 --> 00:20:53.270
and he Jackson,

790
00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:54.430
that's he fishes for fish.

791
00:20:54.431 --> 00:20:54.900
That's fucking,

792
00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:56.520
that's how monster son,

793
00:20:57.090 --> 00:20:57.923
lucky,

794
00:20:58.030 --> 00:21:01.300
lucky don't live in his world to an exact two killers of the seat.

795
00:21:01.301 --> 00:21:02.380
And that's like those sharks,

796
00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:03.010
man.

797
00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:07.330
I watched jaws the other night for the 700,000 time because my girlfriend hadn't

798
00:21:07.331 --> 00:21:08.110
seen it great.

799
00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:08.650
And she's like,

800
00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:09.101
she's like,

801
00:21:09.101 --> 00:21:10.660
I don't like these kind of movies.

802
00:21:10.661 --> 00:21:10.960
I was like,

803
00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:12.140
oh great American.

804
00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:12.820
When she get her,

805
00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:13.480
when I hear,

806
00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:14.800
when I hear her shit on movies,

807
00:21:14.801 --> 00:21:15.720
that's how she talks and,

808
00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:16.590
and she,

809
00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:16.741
she,

810
00:21:16.741 --> 00:21:16.901
you know,

811
00:21:16.901 --> 00:21:17.561
she was like,

812
00:21:17.561 --> 00:21:18.850
I don't want to watch it and watch it.

813
00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:19.301
I'm like,

814
00:21:19.301 --> 00:21:20.350
it's not what you think it is.

815
00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:20.561
I go,

816
00:21:20.561 --> 00:21:21.850
it's a movie that plays on your fears.

817
00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:24.670
It's not something that's going to show you a bunch of Gore the whole time

818
00:21:24.671 --> 00:21:26.620
you're going to see Quinn get gut at the end.

819
00:21:26.621 --> 00:21:27.280
But that's it,

820
00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:27.770
right.

821
00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:28.750
It's a glorious thing.

822
00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:31.240
But it's like that whole amazing thing of it playing on your fears.

823
00:21:31.241 --> 00:21:32.320
And so we watched jaws again.

824
00:21:32.321 --> 00:21:32.861
It was this like,

825
00:21:32.861 --> 00:21:33.041
yeah,

826
00:21:33.041 --> 00:21:33.221
dude,

827
00:21:33.221 --> 00:21:35.590
that thing's just a swimming bucking garbage disposal,

828
00:21:35.591 --> 00:21:36.430
looking to destroy.

829
00:21:36.431 --> 00:21:37.264
No reason,

830
00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:37.961
no sympathy,

831
00:21:37.961 --> 00:21:38.794
no empathy,

832
00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:41.260
just muscles and teeth and eating.

833
00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:43.210
And that's fucking bad ass that that exists.

834
00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:44.200
You just stay away from it,

835
00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:45.713
you know?

836
00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:47.020
But she ended up liking the movie.

837
00:21:47.021 --> 00:21:47.410
She's like,

838
00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:48.161
I liked that man.

839
00:21:48.161 --> 00:21:48.380
I was like,

840
00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:49.270
does that tail of the,

841
00:21:49.271 --> 00:21:49.631
see?

842
00:21:49.631 --> 00:21:50.770
How could you not like it?

843
00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:53.650
We have completely separated ourselves from the food chain.

844
00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:54.520
We were just like,

845
00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:55.120
listen,

846
00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:55.391
listen,

847
00:21:55.391 --> 00:21:55.721
listen,

848
00:21:55.721 --> 00:21:56.554
stop.

849
00:21:56.650 --> 00:21:58.630
No one's eaten us back the fuck up.

850
00:21:58.631 --> 00:21:58.900
Nope.

851
00:21:58.900 --> 00:21:59.733
We're out of the game.

852
00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:00.790
Out of the game.

853
00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:01.450
Here's the deal.

854
00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:02.260
We got tanks.

855
00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:03.400
I got nuclear weapons.

856
00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:03.820
All right.

857
00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:04.900
You want to get crazy?

858
00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:06.070
You want to get crazy will kill you.

859
00:22:06.071 --> 00:22:06.820
All right?

860
00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:07.391
But for right now,

861
00:22:07.391 --> 00:22:08.080
we're out of the game.

862
00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:10.670
So you go eat [inaudible] we're not going to stop any of that.

863
00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:14.050
We're not going to protect the monkeys from the chimps were not protecting

864
00:22:14.051 --> 00:22:15.130
anybody from anybody else.

865
00:22:15.131 --> 00:22:16.210
We let it all go down,

866
00:22:16.211 --> 00:22:16.540
right?

867
00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:17.373
Except people,

868
00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:18.190
except people.

869
00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:19.510
As soon as you start eating people,

870
00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:20.740
you ain't hunting me.

871
00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:21.311
That's for fun.

872
00:22:21.311 --> 00:22:22.990
Some lady got killed in Africa last week,

873
00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:23.500
uh,

874
00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:26.230
ally and made it into her yard and killed her.

875
00:22:26.231 --> 00:22:26.681
She was,

876
00:22:26.681 --> 00:22:27.130
um,

877
00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:27.341
uh,

878
00:22:27.341 --> 00:22:29.050
apparently this is a line had escaped.

879
00:22:29.051 --> 00:22:30.730
There was a hole in one of the fences.

880
00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:34.870
They have game parks where they have lion reserve just wild.

881
00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:36.820
And apparently they're fucking actually fenced in,

882
00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:39.340
which is amazing to try to wrap your head around.

883
00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:44.240
But something like a rhino or a fucking elephant damage the fence and align.

884
00:22:44.241 --> 00:22:44.780
Snuck through.

885
00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:45.670
Started eating people.

886
00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:46.470
Yeah.

887
00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:49.300
And they found her like remains in the bushes.

888
00:22:49.301 --> 00:22:51.040
Just it just nothing left.

889
00:22:51.041 --> 00:22:51.400
What's that?

890
00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:53.560
What's a dollar skin eight or body?

891
00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:57.850
What's the movie with Willem Defoe and the lions and the ghost and the darkness.

892
00:22:58.210 --> 00:22:59.043
Not Willing to,

893
00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:00.830
it's a Michael Douglas and vow kill.

894
00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:01.331
That's right.

895
00:23:01.331 --> 00:23:01.751
That's right.

896
00:23:01.751 --> 00:23:03.460
Movie is story.

897
00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:03.851
That's the fuck.

898
00:23:03.851 --> 00:23:04.150
Yeah.

899
00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:05.350
Really Happy People.

900
00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:06.700
Osca yeah.

901
00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:07.830
Ooh,

902
00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:08.710
that's a good movie.

903
00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:13.840
That's a great horror movie about a real animal and about shit that can happen.

904
00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:14.621
Fuck yeah.

905
00:23:14.621 --> 00:23:15.221
It can happen.

906
00:23:15.221 --> 00:23:16.054
Dude.

907
00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:17.200
That's an amazing film.

908
00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:17.701
And uh,

909
00:23:17.701 --> 00:23:18.491
really about a,

910
00:23:18.491 --> 00:23:19.480
a group of lines.

911
00:23:19.481 --> 00:23:21.870
I think it was two lions together.

912
00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:22.740
Something.

913
00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:22.990
Yeah.

914
00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:23.823
I think that the,

915
00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:27.600
what was interesting about it was that they didn't know that male lions would a

916
00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:28.240
hunt.

917
00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:28.540
Right.

918
00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:30.130
There was always said that males don't hunt,

919
00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:30.970
they stay home.

920
00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:33.850
But these males just decided to start hunting people cause I got bored.

921
00:23:33.851 --> 00:23:34.840
They're like they let's go hunt.

922
00:23:34.841 --> 00:23:35.674
Hom Yeah,

923
00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:37.570
I think they just realize how easy it is.

924
00:23:37.571 --> 00:23:38.290
Yeah.

925
00:23:38.290 --> 00:23:40.630
I think once one of them just eats a person and goes,

926
00:23:40.631 --> 00:23:41.464
Jesus Christ,

927
00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:43.100
why am I chasing after gazelles?

928
00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:46.280
This is a person as a hundred percent catch.

929
00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:48.880
<v 0>You ever watch like Gizelle's almost get away.</v>

930
00:23:48.881 --> 00:23:49.760
You're going to have to seven years.

931
00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:50.420
Yeah.

932
00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:53.350
Cause sometimes I take a left when it was a good thing to take a left.

933
00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:54.440
You're gone.

934
00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:59.050
When you watch a tiger chasing down a fucking gazelle or anything online,

935
00:23:59.051 --> 00:24:00.290
in chasing down in any,

936
00:24:00.291 --> 00:24:00.710
any,

937
00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:01.011
anything,

938
00:24:01.011 --> 00:24:02.360
chasing down a fast thing,

939
00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:07.130
but how fucking fast that thing is running to stay alive and then think of how

940
00:24:07.131 --> 00:24:08.690
slow you are.

941
00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:10.160
Oh my God,

942
00:24:10.161 --> 00:24:11.540
we're so slow.

943
00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:12.950
30 or 40 mile an hour.

944
00:24:12.951 --> 00:24:14.570
Chase is happening in the world.

945
00:24:14.650 --> 00:24:16.120
<v 3>Have you ever seen them attack a hippo?</v>

946
00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:16.790
I saw it was one,

947
00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:19.510
it was like six of them on top of a hippo trying to get this hippo,

948
00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:20.413
hippo,

949
00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:21.191
hippo Hybels,

950
00:24:21.191 --> 00:24:22.510
or like one of the most dangerous animals.

951
00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:24.161
Oh yeah.

952
00:24:24.161 --> 00:24:24.671
And this one,

953
00:24:24.671 --> 00:24:26.510
hippo was just like slowly walking water.

954
00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:26.920
It's like,

955
00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:31.920
like all these tires are lines on it and like just trying to eat it after beast.

956
00:24:32.111 --> 00:24:34.660
A lot of a out of their main videos,

957
00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:38.440
lions attacking hip and it's just a slow walk.

958
00:24:38.441 --> 00:24:38.621
Wow.

959
00:24:38.621 --> 00:24:40.390
This hippo is just being eaten alive.

960
00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:41.201
God,

961
00:24:41.201 --> 00:24:42.310
this is crazy.

962
00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:43.870
I'm watching it right now.

963
00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:44.733
All My god,

964
00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:48.070
this is the lion is riding on the back of the hippo while he's eating it.

965
00:24:48.071 --> 00:24:48.730
Just getting it.

966
00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:49.563
He's just hanging on.

967
00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:51.510
<v 0>Is that fucking crazy?</v>

968
00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:53.420
And look at,

969
00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:55.310
there's the next day you see it with the,

970
00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:57.390
with the spine is hanging out.

971
00:24:57.420 --> 00:24:58.760
Literally took a hunk out of the,

972
00:24:58.761 --> 00:25:00.180
of the spine of this thing.

973
00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:03.150
<v 3>Where are you going home and let me get a bite and you ever watched that?</v>

974
00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:04.410
Oh my God,

975
00:25:04.411 --> 00:25:05.490
this is hard to watch.

976
00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:07.260
Mad Cause they can't kill it.

977
00:25:07.770 --> 00:25:08.603
It's

978
00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:12.120
when you see the eyes of what the animal is happening too.

979
00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:13.350
Like why are you doing this to me?

980
00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:13.800
I know.

981
00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:14.640
Who are you eating me?

982
00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:15.450
I just want to go.

983
00:25:15.450 --> 00:25:16.570
He's just dealing with it.

984
00:25:17.330 --> 00:25:19.350
There's a good show called big cats diary.

985
00:25:19.351 --> 00:25:21.840
I think it is a big fan of that show,

986
00:25:21.841 --> 00:25:23.050
but they always have this.

987
00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:23.970
There was one recently,

988
00:25:23.971 --> 00:25:24.710
there was a,

989
00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:25.081
what was it,

990
00:25:25.081 --> 00:25:26.450
a nerd folks

991
00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:28.570
<v 0>wash as it's called lion attack.</v>

992
00:25:28.571 --> 00:25:29.404
Hippo.

993
00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:33.250
This is fucking gnarly.

994
00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:35.073
Wow.

995
00:25:37.630 --> 00:25:38.530
Holy Shit.

996
00:25:38.531 --> 00:25:41.830
Something completely off subject that is freaking me out.

997
00:25:41.831 --> 00:25:43.080
That video just frequent it.

998
00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:48.400
How amazing is it that that's a real everyday occurrence out there in the world

999
00:25:48.401 --> 00:25:49.030
somewhere?

1000
00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:49.121
Oh,

1001
00:25:49.121 --> 00:25:53.950
there's a spot of the world where there's a giant monsters taking down 3000

1002
00:25:53.951 --> 00:25:54.721
pound animals.

1003
00:25:54.721 --> 00:25:55.120
Yeah.

1004
00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:56.790
Slowly biting their spine.

1005
00:25:56.910 --> 00:25:59.500
<v 2>You know the day that we're going to get excited where I think we're all going</v>

1006
00:25:59.501 --> 00:26:01.740
to call each other and I really feel like the state is going to happen.

1007
00:26:01.741 --> 00:26:02.760
Is that breaking news?

1008
00:26:02.761 --> 00:26:04.410
It's going to come in and we found big foot.

1009
00:26:04.411 --> 00:26:05.244
We got them,

1010
00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:06.240
we found them.

1011
00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:06.641
We went on.

1012
00:26:06.641 --> 00:26:07.474
I think there's,

1013
00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:08.533
yeah,

1014
00:26:08.550 --> 00:26:09.120
I didn't know.

1015
00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:09.990
I don't think it,

1016
00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:12.060
I think I'm open to the possibility.

1017
00:26:12.061 --> 00:26:12.481
It's just,

1018
00:26:12.481 --> 00:26:12.781
you know what?

1019
00:26:12.781 --> 00:26:15.740
So your 2011 lots of cameras bring me his head and nothing less.

1020
00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:16.940
You know what I mean?

1021
00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:20.400
Big Foot is very sexy or that joke he used to have that you used to talk about

1022
00:26:20.401 --> 00:26:23.460
in search of a loch ness or whatever it was like it'd be like in search of

1023
00:26:23.461 --> 00:26:24.294
snuffaluffagus.

1024
00:26:24.330 --> 00:26:25.650
Well now they have the inserts a bigfoot,

1025
00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:25.861
right?

1026
00:26:25.861 --> 00:26:26.340
Yeah.

1027
00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:29.100
And it's like somebody gave money to this and that's one of those things we

1028
00:26:29.101 --> 00:26:29.934
talked about,

1029
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.530
like we were talking about somebody earlier,

1030
00:26:31.531 --> 00:26:33.480
like not believing things are checking fast.

1031
00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:35.070
Things are very simple to understand.

1032
00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:36.210
Like I've said this before,

1033
00:26:36.211 --> 00:26:37.920
like if somebody in this world is levitating,

1034
00:26:37.921 --> 00:26:40.110
he'd be the most famous person in the history of time ever.

1035
00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:42.150
He would have done the most impressive thing ever.

1036
00:26:42.770 --> 00:26:43.320
He would made,

1037
00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:43.531
you know,

1038
00:26:43.531 --> 00:26:43.980
Da Vinci

1039
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:45.210
<v 1>and everybody looked like poop,</v>

1040
00:26:45.211 --> 00:26:47.310
but a sex professor x from the x men.

1041
00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:47.940
Yeah.

1042
00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:48.631
It's just like,

1043
00:26:48.631 --> 00:26:49.231
what the fuck?

1044
00:26:49.231 --> 00:26:50.064
So people would be like,

1045
00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:51.840
the others do really could levitate.

1046
00:26:51.841 --> 00:26:52.130
Yeah,

1047
00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:52.420
yeah.

1048
00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:52.540
No,

1049
00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:52.921
it's like,

1050
00:26:52.921 --> 00:26:53.340
no,

1051
00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:54.930
you would be amazing if you could.

1052
00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:55.920
You know,

1053
00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:56.700
if you really could.

1054
00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:57.870
But so the big foot thing,

1055
00:26:57.900 --> 00:26:59.010
that logic tells you this,

1056
00:26:59.011 --> 00:26:59.401
it's like,

1057
00:26:59.401 --> 00:26:59.641
look,

1058
00:26:59.641 --> 00:27:02.880
they would preempt the president's state of the Union address to tell you they

1059
00:27:02.881 --> 00:27:03.714
found big foot.

1060
00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:05.760
They would preempt anything.

1061
00:27:05.761 --> 00:27:07.410
It would be the most important story ever.

1062
00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:08.550
Yeah,

1063
00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:11.790
so a lot of the resources to going to look for it and the only way it can exist

1064
00:27:11.791 --> 00:27:12.650
is because here,

1065
00:27:12.690 --> 00:27:13.350
here's why.

1066
00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:17.610
Here's the side I'll take is we have this arrogance is as men basically that

1067
00:27:17.611 --> 00:27:18.810
we've conquered all of the earth.

1068
00:27:18.811 --> 00:27:20.220
We know every nook and cranny,

1069
00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:22.350
you know there's places that you can go down,

1070
00:27:22.351 --> 00:27:23.850
you can go sideways into the earth.

1071
00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:25.590
There's just so many nooks and crannies.

1072
00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:26.041
Now.

1073
00:27:26.041 --> 00:27:26.760
If there's some,

1074
00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:27.001
you know,

1075
00:27:27.001 --> 00:27:29.640
seven foot eight walking around and hasn't been seen,

1076
00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:31.380
maybe in the Himalayas somewhere,

1077
00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:33.840
maybe we're man can't get to maybe the abominable,

1078
00:27:33.841 --> 00:27:34.461
a bound minimum.

1079
00:27:34.461 --> 00:27:35.880
It'll go a little snow man.

1080
00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:36.451
Whatever.

1081
00:27:36.451 --> 00:27:36.870
The white,

1082
00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:37.320
the white,

1083
00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:38.310
the white pig foot,

1084
00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:40.590
you're more inclined to believe that like the Tibet.

1085
00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:42.680
Then the board clients squat bleed,

1086
00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:44.040
the Yeti version.

1087
00:27:44.041 --> 00:27:48.300
Then the Pacific Northwestern version think it was probably a real animal.

1088
00:27:48.330 --> 00:27:49.050
That's what I think.

1089
00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:51.540
I think it probably went extinct a long time ago,

1090
00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:52.860
which I can't show many.

1091
00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:53.821
It's gigantic.

1092
00:27:53.821 --> 00:27:54.860
Pethica says the action.

1093
00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:55.860
The Chicago Museum,

1094
00:27:55.861 --> 00:27:57.210
they have a nice mockup of his,

1095
00:27:57.211 --> 00:27:57.930
his skeleton.

1096
00:27:57.930 --> 00:27:58.080
Yeah,

1097
00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:01.020
and it's like this giant eight foot fucking gorilla and it totally looks like

1098
00:28:01.021 --> 00:28:02.280
what you would think of as big foot.

1099
00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:03.263
I guess it was by,

1100
00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:04.380
it wasn't bipedal though.

1101
00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:05.880
It would sometimes walk on a time,

1102
00:28:05.881 --> 00:28:06.660
legs,

1103
00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:10.230
but enough so that if you saw one walking on its hind legs,

1104
00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:11.250
who the fuck knows?

1105
00:28:11.251 --> 00:28:14.370
I mean it's all completely speculation of all of her.

1106
00:28:14.770 --> 00:28:18.000
If you're playing the the Joe Rogan experience drinking game,

1107
00:28:18.001 --> 00:28:18.930
I think that's one shot.

1108
00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:19.801
What is the Joe Rogan?

1109
00:28:19.801 --> 00:28:20.840
Who's a foster knows I go,

1110
00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:21.841
cause I say that all the time.

1111
00:28:21.841 --> 00:28:23.040
Who the fuck knows who the fuck knows?

1112
00:28:23.150 --> 00:28:24.060
I think that's one shot.

1113
00:28:24.090 --> 00:28:25.620
Did you hear that story of Oliver,

1114
00:28:25.621 --> 00:28:27.150
the purported man champion ever?

1115
00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:29.670
Did I tell you I watched that and watched a whole documentary on him.

1116
00:28:29.671 --> 00:28:31.110
He was a chimpanzee.

1117
00:28:31.111 --> 00:28:32.340
They just had a really weird,

1118
00:28:32.341 --> 00:28:32.761
amazing,

1119
00:28:32.761 --> 00:28:33.840
weird anomaly.

1120
00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:35.160
A bunch of them walked,

1121
00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:36.420
walks straight up,

1122
00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:39.900
didn't want to crouch over and walk on all fours and wanted to fuck women

1123
00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:40.741
wanting to fuck women.

1124
00:28:40.741 --> 00:28:41.640
And it was,

1125
00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:42.070
yeah,

1126
00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:45.030
was like hanging around with people and really despise chimps.

1127
00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:48.030
But he started getting really creepy with the woman and in front of me had a

1128
00:28:48.031 --> 00:28:48.864
lock 'em up,

1129
00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:50.730
ready to rape all over.

1130
00:28:50.731 --> 00:28:52.200
The chimps don't have any moral span.

1131
00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:53.041
The Dick gets hard.

1132
00:28:53.041 --> 00:28:54.900
They're ready to rape cause that's how it works in the chimp world.

1133
00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:56.040
They don't have the in.

1134
00:28:56.041 --> 00:28:57.780
So he was doing his best to listen,

1135
00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:00.180
but he's fighting against some crazy instincts.

1136
00:29:00.181 --> 00:29:03.210
He's not getting any sexual satisfaction and he's going to find it somewhere.

1137
00:29:03.211 --> 00:29:03.721
He,

1138
00:29:03.721 --> 00:29:06.960
they were showing him because in the 70s they actually concluded that he was

1139
00:29:06.961 --> 00:29:07.471
half man,

1140
00:29:07.471 --> 00:29:11.370
half eight because DNA testing was so crude that they couldn't narrow it down.

1141
00:29:11.371 --> 00:29:11.880
Now they're like,

1142
00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:12.181
oh no,

1143
00:29:12.181 --> 00:29:13.050
he's just a fucked up.

1144
00:29:13.051 --> 00:29:13.360
Hey.

1145
00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:14.160
Yeah.

1146
00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:17.430
And every once where I think a gorilla came out last year who walks on on,

1147
00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:21.540
he was bipedal walks around just looking around at shit just as humans.

1148
00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:22.580
It's like w you know,

1149
00:29:22.590 --> 00:29:23.640
so many people would conclude.

1150
00:29:23.641 --> 00:29:23.881
It's like,

1151
00:29:23.881 --> 00:29:24.810
I've never seen that.

1152
00:29:24.811 --> 00:29:25.351
It's new.

1153
00:29:25.351 --> 00:29:26.550
It's obviously half man.

1154
00:29:26.551 --> 00:29:29.640
It's like part of me would like to think there's somebody out there tinkering

1155
00:29:29.641 --> 00:29:30.391
with something like that,

1156
00:29:30.391 --> 00:29:32.610
but that's a really fucked up thing to do.

1157
00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:32.911
Well,

1158
00:29:32.911 --> 00:29:33.061
it's,

1159
00:29:33.061 --> 00:29:36.030
Leslie happened and there was a recent article in,

1160
00:29:36.031 --> 00:29:36.420
um,

1161
00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:37.750
I know it's not the best source of the,

1162
00:29:37.751 --> 00:29:42.120
the UK in the daily mail was talking about a scientists have created,

1163
00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:45.500
I believe it was over a hundred different embryos that were hybrids of,

1164
00:29:45.730 --> 00:29:46.960
of babies and you know,

1165
00:29:46.961 --> 00:29:48.660
human and some other animal.

1166
00:29:48.770 --> 00:29:48.871
Well,

1167
00:29:48.871 --> 00:29:51.610
what I recommend created embryos when I read about the light and all the

1168
00:29:51.611 --> 00:29:52.391
different shit they did,

1169
00:29:52.391 --> 00:29:54.400
I thought it was just Napoleon dynamite fucking around.

1170
00:29:54.401 --> 00:29:54.491
We,

1171
00:29:54.491 --> 00:29:55.520
I think we talked about the class.

1172
00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:56.230
I know laggers.

1173
00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:56.700
Israel,

1174
00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:57.533
the real deal.

1175
00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:57.941
They don't,

1176
00:29:57.941 --> 00:30:00.250
I don't think there's ever a time in the wild where they're,

1177
00:30:00.251 --> 00:30:01.420
they're in the same habitat,

1178
00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:01.961
but you know,

1179
00:30:01.961 --> 00:30:04.480
what they said is the only has to happens in captivity.

1180
00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:05.800
I think it happens in captivity,

1181
00:30:05.801 --> 00:30:07.720
but they were saying this and this has happened recently.

1182
00:30:07.721 --> 00:30:08.020
They're like,

1183
00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:08.831
they can't reproduce.

1184
00:30:08.831 --> 00:30:10.450
So they're all born sterile or they're all,

1185
00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:11.650
you know that that's it.

1186
00:30:11.651 --> 00:30:12.880
That's one generation hybrid.

1187
00:30:12.881 --> 00:30:16.050
It's just like there's hybrid fish that have the same situation.

1188
00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:17.820
Some hat reproduce really.

1189
00:30:17.890 --> 00:30:20.800
So that's telling you that genetically now they're adapting and this lagger

1190
00:30:20.801 --> 00:30:24.610
thing would get killed out in the wild because it's fucking enormous and slow.

1191
00:30:24.910 --> 00:30:26.920
It's giant and slow to sitting target.

1192
00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:28.510
Like I thought it was really slow.

1193
00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:29.390
They're slow because they're,

1194
00:30:29.391 --> 00:30:31.930
they're twice the size of a normal lion or tiger.

1195
00:30:32.170 --> 00:30:34.270
They're the size of a lion and the tiger put together.

1196
00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:36.340
But when an animal is be more scared of it though,

1197
00:30:36.341 --> 00:30:39.310
so they might actually be there and art and animals.

1198
00:30:39.670 --> 00:30:41.920
Just as you saw that line in Japan on a hippos back,

1199
00:30:41.921 --> 00:30:42.860
don't give a fuck.

1200
00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:46.750
This is how brilliant Napoleon dynamite was to this day.

1201
00:30:46.751 --> 00:30:48.880
It's ridiculous to talk about a lagger.

1202
00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:51.820
I just was avoiding talking about this animal.

1203
00:30:51.821 --> 00:30:53.170
I was avoiding talking about this.

1204
00:30:53.171 --> 00:30:54.370
Cause you know what dude?

1205
00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:55.990
The proliant dynamite already covered this.

1206
00:30:57.340 --> 00:30:57.851
But you know,

1207
00:30:57.851 --> 00:30:59.500
I thought he was joking.

1208
00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:00.393
No,

1209
00:31:00.910 --> 00:31:01.743
no.

1210
00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:04.010
Most people think it's a joke there.

1211
00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:05.200
They're so ridiculous looking.

1212
00:31:05.201 --> 00:31:05.921
They're cartoonish.

1213
00:31:05.921 --> 00:31:07.570
There's the one that you'll see online.

1214
00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:09.970
I always look for the video and the one in motion,

1215
00:31:09.971 --> 00:31:11.470
it's just this amazingly,

1216
00:31:11.530 --> 00:31:12.910
absurdly huge thing.

1217
00:31:12.911 --> 00:31:13.331
But it's like,

1218
00:31:13.331 --> 00:31:13.541
you know,

1219
00:31:13.541 --> 00:31:14.980
they keep miniaturizing things.

1220
00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:16.480
I want to see them make things bigger.

1221
00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:16.940
Well,

1222
00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:17.130
no,

1223
00:31:17.130 --> 00:31:18.100
apparently what it is,

1224
00:31:18.101 --> 00:31:19.000
is that the,

1225
00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:24.060
the gene for like ceasing growth or do the gene that limits growth is removed

1226
00:31:26.410 --> 00:31:27.880
when the to mate with each other.

1227
00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:28.171
Right.

1228
00:31:28.171 --> 00:31:30.280
It's like a male tiger or female line.

1229
00:31:30.281 --> 00:31:32.710
I think I got it right when that happens.

1230
00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:33.200
The,

1231
00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:34.960
the gene for growth,

1232
00:31:34.961 --> 00:31:35.331
like the,

1233
00:31:35.331 --> 00:31:37.810
the gene for regulating growth gets all fucked up.

1234
00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:38.980
So they just grow shoe.

1235
00:31:39.010 --> 00:31:40.450
There's one on the other side too.

1236
00:31:40.451 --> 00:31:41.284
There's the,

1237
00:31:41.670 --> 00:31:42.431
there's the lagger.

1238
00:31:42.431 --> 00:31:42.861
But the,

1239
00:31:42.861 --> 00:31:44.260
the Thai tie,

1240
00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:45.153
I don't know what they're calling.

1241
00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:46.090
They're mixing the words together.

1242
00:31:46.150 --> 00:31:47.650
So now you're talking about,

1243
00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:48.580
um,

1244
00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:49.031
you know,

1245
00:31:49.031 --> 00:31:50.470
like a tiger with a Maine.

1246
00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:52.690
Why not tangled tiger with a main,

1247
00:31:52.810 --> 00:31:54.190
oh dude.

1248
00:31:55.090 --> 00:31:55.930
What's that called?

1249
00:31:56.010 --> 00:31:56.560
Uh,

1250
00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:57.920
look up a tea,

1251
00:31:57.950 --> 00:32:00.340
Greg maybe or a a tea grass.

1252
00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:00.790
Really?

1253
00:32:00.790 --> 00:32:01.241
I don't ever,

1254
00:32:01.241 --> 00:32:01.871
I don't remember.

1255
00:32:01.871 --> 00:32:02.231
It was,

1256
00:32:02.231 --> 00:32:03.064
uh,

1257
00:32:03.330 --> 00:32:03.740
I,

1258
00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:06.700
it's when I was looking at those laggers that time and I started seeing all

1259
00:32:06.701 --> 00:32:08.740
these fucked up animals they've been messing with.

1260
00:32:08.741 --> 00:32:09.610
It's amazing.

1261
00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:10.030
Well,

1262
00:32:10.030 --> 00:32:10.630
did they,

1263
00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:14.380
I wonder if anybody would like to find out if that happened naturally,

1264
00:32:14.381 --> 00:32:17.840
the lagger thing or if that was something that people fucked around with a

1265
00:32:17.850 --> 00:32:18.030
assume.

1266
00:32:18.030 --> 00:32:18.851
It probably had to.

1267
00:32:18.851 --> 00:32:20.230
I always look for videos in motion.

1268
00:32:20.231 --> 00:32:21.250
I won't accept a picture.

1269
00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:22.010
You know what I mean?

1270
00:32:22.010 --> 00:32:22.151
Well,

1271
00:32:22.151 --> 00:32:23.950
I don't think Fred scratches the surface.

1272
00:32:23.951 --> 00:32:24.640
Joe Rogan.

1273
00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:25.181
I understand.

1274
00:32:25.181 --> 00:32:25.511
You know what I mean?

1275
00:32:25.511 --> 00:32:26.470
It's good when I dig deep,

1276
00:32:26.530 --> 00:32:27.400
when I go to Wikipedia,

1277
00:32:27.401 --> 00:32:29.140
check your sources and then I check your sources.

1278
00:32:29.141 --> 00:32:29.974
Sources.

1279
00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:33.370
Has anybody ever been killed by one of these things?

1280
00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:34.210
I don't.

1281
00:32:34.210 --> 00:32:34.720
I don't think so.

1282
00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:35.531
Cause high gone.

1283
00:32:35.531 --> 00:32:36.370
This Guy Saigon.

1284
00:32:36.371 --> 00:32:36.820
Yeah.

1285
00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:37.240
Let me see.

1286
00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:38.320
Let me check out a tag on,

1287
00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:39.580
cause now and they're kind of,

1288
00:32:39.730 --> 00:32:39.870
they're,

1289
00:32:39.870 --> 00:32:40.070
they're

1290
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:40.840
<v 0>funny looking,</v>

1291
00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:41.890
but the bangle buyers,

1292
00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:42.480
the biggest.

1293
00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:43.313
Cool.

1294
00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:44.091
These are cool.

1295
00:32:44.091 --> 00:32:44.751
It's fun,

1296
00:32:44.751 --> 00:32:45.410
aren't they?

1297
00:32:45.410 --> 00:32:46.250
Wow.

1298
00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:48.260
That's all we need.

1299
00:32:48.261 --> 00:32:50.120
More giant shit that can kill us.

1300
00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:53.120
There's a photo of this lady lying on a,

1301
00:32:53.130 --> 00:32:53.850
uh,

1302
00:32:53.850 --> 00:32:54.410
uh,

1303
00:32:54.410 --> 00:32:56.690
a tie gone and it's enormous.

1304
00:32:56.691 --> 00:32:57.524
It's so big.

1305
00:32:57.710 --> 00:32:58.640
Oh my God,

1306
00:32:58.641 --> 00:32:59.474
it's big.

1307
00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:02.090
Wow.

1308
00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:03.260
I wouldn't you dude,

1309
00:33:03.261 --> 00:33:08.261
I would be scared of a fucking cat that weighs 10 pounds for cat weighs 10

1310
00:33:08.751 --> 00:33:09.620
pounds of a rat,

1311
00:33:09.621 --> 00:33:10.700
weighed five pounds.

1312
00:33:10.701 --> 00:33:11.960
I'm terrified of a rat,

1313
00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:13.450
a five pound rant.

1314
00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:14.900
This is coming to try to fuck you up.

1315
00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:15.840
You know,

1316
00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:18.140
it's you just some manage and help God damn help us.

1317
00:33:18.141 --> 00:33:18.920
You would feel.

1318
00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:20.540
But Tiger decided to Jackie.

1319
00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:20.840
Yeah.

1320
00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:22.230
They have nothing but bad intentions.

1321
00:33:22.231 --> 00:33:23.420
So there's no reasoning with it.

1322
00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:26.810
Are they nice to loggers or they're like calm down.

1323
00:33:26.811 --> 00:33:29.780
They're pretty docile as a result of being manmade,

1324
00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:32.270
sitting around with only zookeepers and zoologists.

1325
00:33:32.270 --> 00:33:33.860
And actually no one said it was a jack.

1326
00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:34.640
A lagger.

1327
00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:36.890
You'd have to be a crypto zoologist to even,

1328
00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:39.970
has anyone been killed by Allegra chipped?

1329
00:33:40.030 --> 00:33:41.000
Believe I'm doing this.

1330
00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:42.490
Maybe there's a or up at Folsom.

1331
00:33:42.491 --> 00:33:43.251
I kill folks.

1332
00:33:43.251 --> 00:33:43.361
Well,

1333
00:33:43.361 --> 00:33:44.001
that's the problem,

1334
00:33:44.001 --> 00:33:44.211
man.

1335
00:33:44.211 --> 00:33:46.430
This fucking Napoleon dynamite is ruined his life.

1336
00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:49.430
People think it's fictional to the point when I tell people,

1337
00:33:49.431 --> 00:33:49.810
they're like,

1338
00:33:49.810 --> 00:33:50.320
Ooh,

1339
00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:51.153
route,

1340
00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:52.353
and I'm like,

1341
00:33:52.790 --> 00:33:57.790
has anybody Leiger attack kills animal handler first fucking page.

1342
00:33:58.760 --> 00:33:59.660
People magazine.

1343
00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:00.350
Yep.

1344
00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:05.330
Against protocol handler entered lion tigered hybrid space during feeding

1345
00:34:05.390 --> 00:34:06.530
oopsies.

1346
00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:07.701
Wow.

1347
00:34:07.701 --> 00:34:11.900
An animal handler with thousands of hours of experiences died after being mauled

1348
00:34:11.901 --> 00:34:15.710
by a 1000 pound lion tiger hybrid.

1349
00:34:15.711 --> 00:34:17.840
He was feeding 1000 pounds,

1350
00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:21.080
1000 pounds,

1351
00:34:21.081 --> 00:34:21.914
half a ton.

1352
00:34:23.470 --> 00:34:23.861
You talk,

1353
00:34:23.861 --> 00:34:25.190
it says you're talking about an animal.

1354
00:34:25.191 --> 00:34:28.340
There's 20 times more powerful than the human being that was feeding it.

1355
00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:32.390
One of the most important protocols with these powerful cats in captivity is

1356
00:34:32.391 --> 00:34:35.420
never entered their enclosure with the animal present,

1357
00:34:35.421 --> 00:34:37.280
especially when it involves food.

1358
00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:38.640
Yeah.

1359
00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:41.570
She's even like keeping your domestic house.

1360
00:34:41.571 --> 00:34:43.070
Cat goes straight for those instincts,

1361
00:34:43.071 --> 00:34:43.970
those while instincts.

1362
00:34:43.971 --> 00:34:46.010
It's like even if you drag a little mouse in front of it,

1363
00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:47.030
they go right into hunting mode.

1364
00:34:47.031 --> 00:34:47.720
It's not playtime.

1365
00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:47.901
It's like,

1366
00:34:47.901 --> 00:34:48.321
oh my God,

1367
00:34:48.321 --> 00:34:48.861
that thing's moving.

1368
00:34:48.861 --> 00:34:49.400
You've got to kill it.

1369
00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:51.910
What an amazing animal that nature has created.

1370
00:34:52.370 --> 00:34:57.370
It's basically this super killer that just keeps all the weak things dead and

1371
00:34:58.401 --> 00:35:00.830
keeps the population in check and breasts,

1372
00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:02.660
breasts and just chills,

1373
00:35:02.661 --> 00:35:03.021
rest,

1374
00:35:03.021 --> 00:35:04.310
and he would look at the spot.

1375
00:35:04.430 --> 00:35:07.550
Look at this spot of the world where the most cattle the most,

1376
00:35:07.830 --> 00:35:08.300
you know,

1377
00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:09.470
undulate animals,

1378
00:35:09.471 --> 00:35:12.440
the most hooved animals are running around those.

1379
00:35:12.441 --> 00:35:14.210
That spot spot is Africa,

1380
00:35:14.211 --> 00:35:14.630
right?

1381
00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:18.470
That's where you get these great her hordes of Willdabeast and Sarah and gather

1382
00:35:18.471 --> 00:35:23.060
buffaloes and to make all these amazing fucking animals and that's where the big

1383
00:35:23.061 --> 00:35:23.781
monsters live.

1384
00:35:23.781 --> 00:35:25.540
They're the cleanup crew man there,

1385
00:35:25.570 --> 00:35:30.180
the genetic cleanup crew there to make sure that only the super healthy one

1386
00:35:30.181 --> 00:35:30.920
survive.

1387
00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:34.610
You make sure you keep your genetic strong because everything is little and weak

1388
00:35:34.611 --> 00:35:35.211
and slow.

1389
00:35:35.211 --> 00:35:38.160
We're going to get them on the phone and nature

1390
00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:39.390
<v 1>even works in our society.</v>

1391
00:35:39.391 --> 00:35:41.010
I think a lot more than than people know too.

1392
00:35:41.370 --> 00:35:41.880
It does.

1393
00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:42.120
You know?

1394
00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:42.953
Unfortunately,

1395
00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:44.640
even when it's domestic,

1396
00:35:44.641 --> 00:35:45.570
we consider ourselves,

1397
00:35:45.571 --> 00:35:47.010
don't you think we weed out the weak shoe,

1398
00:35:47.011 --> 00:35:47.431
the mops,

1399
00:35:47.431 --> 00:35:48.570
but the mountain keep moving on.

1400
00:35:48.930 --> 00:35:49.141
Yeah,

1401
00:35:49.141 --> 00:35:49.471
we do.

1402
00:35:49.471 --> 00:35:50.520
I think there's a balance.

1403
00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:52.230
I think there's a balance in doing that.

1404
00:35:52.290 --> 00:35:54.330
I think the week definitely need to be chewed up.

1405
00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:57.720
We need to fucking set a standard need to kick people in the balls get him,

1406
00:35:57.721 --> 00:35:57.811
well,

1407
00:35:57.811 --> 00:35:59.190
there's a lot of weak pitches in this world,

1408
00:35:59.250 --> 00:36:01.430
but we also need to have compassionate at the same time.

1409
00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:02.211
It needs to be like a,

1410
00:36:02.211 --> 00:36:03.300
a protocol.

1411
00:36:03.450 --> 00:36:07.380
The need needs to be like a level of compassionate and understanding where you

1412
00:36:07.381 --> 00:36:09.030
don't want people to suffer.

1413
00:36:09.031 --> 00:36:09.940
You don't want people to starve.

1414
00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:12.570
You don't want people who are in bad straits to get,

1415
00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:12.870
you know,

1416
00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:14.880
people would just got fucked by life and you know,

1417
00:36:14.881 --> 00:36:16.500
tornadoes or some horrible thing.

1418
00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:17.880
You don't want them to be out in the cold,

1419
00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:20.730
but you don't want people being wiki either.

1420
00:36:20.731 --> 00:36:22.530
You don't want people being lazy fucks that.

1421
00:36:22.531 --> 00:36:23.430
Rely on the government,

1422
00:36:23.431 --> 00:36:24.370
take care of their bills,

1423
00:36:24.450 --> 00:36:27.400
and then they want to sit around and be a welfare douche.

1424
00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:28.030
You know,

1425
00:36:28.030 --> 00:36:28.261
there's,

1426
00:36:28.261 --> 00:36:29.340
there's that too.

1427
00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:30.360
That's real,

1428
00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:30.931
you know,

1429
00:36:30.931 --> 00:36:31.241
so it,

1430
00:36:31.241 --> 00:36:34.050
it becomes a weird fine line.

1431
00:36:34.051 --> 00:36:34.231
Like,

1432
00:36:34.231 --> 00:36:35.430
where do you draw and how do you,

1433
00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:36.180
how do you,

1434
00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:40.380
how do you make the distinction between being a humanitarian person and being a

1435
00:36:40.381 --> 00:36:41.250
kind person,

1436
00:36:41.251 --> 00:36:41.880
being,

1437
00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:42.211
you know,

1438
00:36:42.211 --> 00:36:45.480
a person wants to help their neighbor and being someone who supports laziness.

1439
00:36:45.481 --> 00:36:47.160
Being someone who enables,

1440
00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:51.330
enables some broken fuck with no discipline to skate through this life.

1441
00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:51.691
That's that,

1442
00:36:51.691 --> 00:36:51.860
that,

1443
00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:53.490
that whole idea of like Buddhism though,

1444
00:36:53.491 --> 00:36:55.390
and his whole theory about it is,

1445
00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:57.510
is as you can't end their suffering,

1446
00:36:57.511 --> 00:36:59.550
you can just end you feeling sorry for them.

1447
00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:00.331
You know what I mean?

1448
00:37:00.331 --> 00:37:01.080
You really can,

1449
00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:02.310
and not in a bad way.

1450
00:37:02.330 --> 00:37:02.461
You know,

1451
00:37:02.461 --> 00:37:02.821
you're right.

1452
00:37:02.821 --> 00:37:04.170
It's like I feel for him,

1453
00:37:04.171 --> 00:37:05.940
but he's not going to affect me in that way.

1454
00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:07.530
You can do that with anything.

1455
00:37:07.531 --> 00:37:09.570
You can do that with the fucking news man.

1456
00:37:09.590 --> 00:37:09.751
Yeah.

1457
00:37:09.751 --> 00:37:10.021
You know,

1458
00:37:10.021 --> 00:37:13.500
you can decide that the world is ending every day of the week because every day

1459
00:37:13.501 --> 00:37:16.470
of the week you can go online and there's some horrible story about some woman

1460
00:37:16.471 --> 00:37:20.070
who was killed by her boyfriend and chopped up and put in a fucking meat locker.

1461
00:37:20.250 --> 00:37:21.390
There's a hundred of those.

1462
00:37:21.391 --> 00:37:22.170
They're coming.

1463
00:37:22.170 --> 00:37:22.621
They're coming,

1464
00:37:22.621 --> 00:37:23.000
every,

1465
00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.090
the sky's falling everywhere.

1466
00:37:24.091 --> 00:37:27.200
This guy's phone with riots and that crazy guy in,

1467
00:37:27.201 --> 00:37:27.441
in,

1468
00:37:27.441 --> 00:37:30.580
in Oslo and killed all those kids and like horrible,

1469
00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:31.321
horrible,

1470
00:37:31.321 --> 00:37:34.440
horrible shit going on somewhere all over the place,

1471
00:37:34.441 --> 00:37:35.274
all the time.

1472
00:37:35.330 --> 00:37:37.530
But if you decide to take all that in,

1473
00:37:37.531 --> 00:37:38.300
man,

1474
00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:39.210
and it's certain point,

1475
00:37:39.330 --> 00:37:44.330
there's a balance between being informed and it benefiting you psychologically,

1476
00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:48.000
there's information and then there's an inundation of information said where now

1477
00:37:48.001 --> 00:37:49.150
you don't have a clearinghouse,

1478
00:37:49.170 --> 00:37:50.310
you're not processing it,

1479
00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:52.170
and now you're starting your leasing out.

1480
00:37:52.170 --> 00:37:52.881
Your opinion to,

1481
00:37:52.881 --> 00:37:56.070
to those who are giving you all this information and now you're seeking out

1482
00:37:56.071 --> 00:37:57.220
particular information.

1483
00:37:57.221 --> 00:37:57.570
Yeah.

1484
00:37:57.570 --> 00:37:58.351
That adheres to it.

1485
00:37:58.351 --> 00:38:01.920
And it's like isolation and lack of challenge of friends and people to say,

1486
00:38:01.921 --> 00:38:02.161
no.

1487
00:38:02.161 --> 00:38:03.060
Well look at it this way.

1488
00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:07.230
I have a buddy who gets real political and thankfully he doesn't live near here,

1489
00:38:07.231 --> 00:38:08.340
so I don't talk to him very much,

1490
00:38:08.341 --> 00:38:10.950
but he'll just start yelling and getting angry and angry.

1491
00:38:10.951 --> 00:38:12.960
I talked to him about like politicians,

1492
00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:13.411
you know,

1493
00:38:13.411 --> 00:38:14.700
he'll just go fucking crazy.

1494
00:38:14.701 --> 00:38:17.670
You see that shit on the Senate floor with fucking Bonner and the bullshit that

1495
00:38:17.671 --> 00:38:19.020
he said or a boner.

1496
00:38:19.021 --> 00:38:19.854
Is that what the guy's name?

1497
00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:24.090
And he'll like argue with you and yelled yo like Yo dude dude dude,

1498
00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:24.420
dude,

1499
00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:24.800
dude,

1500
00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:25.320
yeah,

1501
00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:26.640
get your own shit together.

1502
00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:27.361
Okay,

1503
00:38:27.361 --> 00:38:27.571
you're,

1504
00:38:27.571 --> 00:38:31.670
you're picking a fight and so you've been digit to this crazy stuff.

1505
00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:34.950
You got your whole life investing in it and it's clearly a distraction.

1506
00:38:35.110 --> 00:38:35.980
Your own fucked

1507
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:36.371
<v 2>up light,</v>

1508
00:38:36.371 --> 00:38:38.200
which is the theme of what we've been talking about it.

1509
00:38:38.201 --> 00:38:39.760
It's like saying like the Buddhist sense,

1510
00:38:39.761 --> 00:38:43.840
it's like in suffering and yourself that you won't be a suffering prick anymore

1511
00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:46.360
because then you won't care about what other people are doing if you just end it

1512
00:38:46.361 --> 00:38:46.860
in yourself.

1513
00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:47.641
<v 0>But then people will say,</v>

1514
00:38:47.641 --> 00:38:49.230
well that's ridiculous cause then you saying,

1515
00:38:49.231 --> 00:38:49.410
you know,

1516
00:38:49.410 --> 00:38:51.090
don't pay attention to politics.

1517
00:38:51.091 --> 00:38:51.310
Don't,

1518
00:38:51.310 --> 00:38:52.650
which is not what I'm saying at all.

1519
00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:56.260
What I'm saying is you got to regulate how you're,

1520
00:38:56.270 --> 00:38:56.810
you're,

1521
00:38:56.810 --> 00:38:57.330
what,

1522
00:38:57.330 --> 00:38:58.440
what impacts you.

1523
00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:02.220
You got to regulate what you take in regulate the amount of negativity and

1524
00:39:02.221 --> 00:39:02.821
positivity.

1525
00:39:02.821 --> 00:39:07.080
You actually can do that and he can have a realistic politics or political,

1526
00:39:07.081 --> 00:39:07.914
the politicking.

1527
00:39:08.070 --> 00:39:08.903
I'm not mad.

1528
00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:11.940
Well it's also in a few like really take it seriously.

1529
00:39:11.941 --> 00:39:14.910
You kind of endorse it and if you endorse it even though you know,

1530
00:39:14.911 --> 00:39:16.800
like my friend Jamie Kilstein,

1531
00:39:16.801 --> 00:39:19.770
he's like super political and he was on the podcast and Brian and I were talking

1532
00:39:19.771 --> 00:39:21.900
to him about this and one of the things that we were saying,

1533
00:39:21.901 --> 00:39:22.350
we were like,

1534
00:39:22.350 --> 00:39:24.150
do you think that even by,

1535
00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:28.470
I know that you think it's bullshit and I know you think the special interest

1536
00:39:28.471 --> 00:39:29.640
groups and all these things,

1537
00:39:29.641 --> 00:39:31.830
different things that are affecting the government and affecting,

1538
00:39:32.070 --> 00:39:35.670
but do you think that by like really being into it and critiquing it,

1539
00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:39.540
like you almost like legitimize it cause you almost like you almost like say

1540
00:39:39.541 --> 00:39:39.720
like,

1541
00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:41.730
well this is a real thing that's going on here,

1542
00:39:41.731 --> 00:39:43.020
but it's clearly not a real thing.

1543
00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:44.153
And not to anyone.

1544
00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:46.620
Anyone can get to the position where they can be president.

1545
00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:46.861
Right.

1546
00:39:46.861 --> 00:39:48.300
Super fucking difficult time.

1547
00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:50.490
Every time Ron Palmach makes a run,

1548
00:39:51.090 --> 00:39:54.150
even though his message resonates with so many fucking people.

1549
00:39:54.330 --> 00:39:55.740
So many people are excited by that guy.

1550
00:39:55.741 --> 00:39:58.470
So many people love new radical approach.

1551
00:39:58.830 --> 00:40:00.030
Every single,

1552
00:40:00.031 --> 00:40:00.990
whether it's NBC,

1553
00:40:00.991 --> 00:40:01.741
CBS,

1554
00:40:01.741 --> 00:40:03.000
any news coverage,

1555
00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:04.320
I'll make him look like a joke.

1556
00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:05.493
They,

1557
00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:08.790
they are on purpose forcing him to the joke position.

1558
00:40:08.791 --> 00:40:13.791
It's like it's so obvious that their news departments are in in some way like

1559
00:40:14.161 --> 00:40:14.710
they have a,

1560
00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:18.750
an agenda to mock him because there's no cooperation that want that.

1561
00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:20.430
Once that motherfucker to be in control,

1562
00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:24.300
there's no one who's in a position of power now that would want that crazy

1563
00:40:24.450 --> 00:40:29.450
fucking non evolution believing brilliant man who has so many important things

1564
00:40:30.991 --> 00:40:33.780
that make sense to say fuck.

1565
00:40:33.781 --> 00:40:34.614
They wouldn't let him,

1566
00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:35.610
they wouldn't let him.

1567
00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.100
Then there is no real running for president.

1568
00:40:38.101 --> 00:40:38.934
It's fake.

1569
00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:39.850
It's fake.

1570
00:40:39.850 --> 00:40:40.081
And it's,

1571
00:40:40.081 --> 00:40:40.440
we have,

1572
00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:44.790
we have to admit that we have to interview you if you have this conversation,

1573
00:40:44.791 --> 00:40:47.400
you know like well the Democrats need to do and where the Republicans need to

1574
00:40:47.401 --> 00:40:47.730
do.

1575
00:40:47.730 --> 00:40:48.563
They're not real.

1576
00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:49.860
They're not real.

1577
00:40:50.010 --> 00:40:50.520
Your work.

1578
00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:51.600
This is a corporation.

1579
00:40:51.970 --> 00:40:53.190
Corporations running shit.

1580
00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:55.470
And there's a God damn opera going on.

1581
00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:56.333
That's what it's like.

1582
00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:57.600
It's so antiquated.

1583
00:40:57.601 --> 00:40:58.434
This form of,

1584
00:40:58.500 --> 00:40:59.810
of communication and,

1585
00:40:59.910 --> 00:41:01.950
and this play that's playing back,

1586
00:41:01.951 --> 00:41:05.410
which of the Liberals and the Republicans Talk Radio?

1587
00:41:05.411 --> 00:41:05.640
It's,

1588
00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:06.540
it's shell play.

1589
00:41:06.541 --> 00:41:08.070
It almost seems real.

1590
00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:10.160
<v 2>It's one of those things where it's like an insane,</v>

1591
00:41:10.170 --> 00:41:12.030
she stepped back and look at all the dynamics of it.

1592
00:41:12.031 --> 00:41:12.271
It's like,

1593
00:41:12.271 --> 00:41:13.410
you know the Democrats do it,

1594
00:41:13.411 --> 00:41:14.250
the Republicans do it.

1595
00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:16.620
It's like we get you to not focus on the task at hand.

1596
00:41:16.621 --> 00:41:17.090
We'll create,

1597
00:41:17.090 --> 00:41:17.551
we'll create.

1598
00:41:17.551 --> 00:41:18.720
An enemy will create a fear.

1599
00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:21.180
We'll create something and while all of them are running around,

1600
00:41:21.181 --> 00:41:22.410
you know enough about politics.

1601
00:41:22.411 --> 00:41:23.244
I do too,

1602
00:41:23.250 --> 00:41:24.001
but at the end of the day,

1603
00:41:24.001 --> 00:41:25.770
whether it's George Bush or Barack Obama,

1604
00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:27.180
I ain't going to stop smoking dope.

1605
00:41:27.181 --> 00:41:29.910
I ain't going to stop having fun and being curious about shit.

1606
00:41:30.150 --> 00:41:30.661
You know what I mean?

1607
00:41:30.661 --> 00:41:32.160
It's like they can run their corporation.

1608
00:41:32.161 --> 00:41:33.530
Just don't fuck with me and I'm fine.

1609
00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:33.741
Well,

1610
00:41:33.741 --> 00:41:33.980
that's

1611
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:34.701
<v 1>how it should be.</v>

1612
00:41:34.701 --> 00:41:36.110
But they don't think that the,

1613
00:41:36.111 --> 00:41:36.441
you know,

1614
00:41:36.441 --> 00:41:39.080
the government doesn't think that they should give people very much freedom

1615
00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:40.850
because the more freedom you give more people,

1616
00:41:40.851 --> 00:41:42.200
the more freedom you they want.

1617
00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:43.300
And the more we keep them.

1618
00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:45.560
If you keep them suppressed to a certain point,

1619
00:41:45.650 --> 00:41:47.570
but give them a healthy standard,

1620
00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:48.081
you know,

1621
00:41:48.081 --> 00:41:48.920
not too bad,

1622
00:41:48.921 --> 00:41:49.740
not too crazy,

1623
00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:52.460
just just keep them down a little bit but not too crazy.

1624
00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:57.140
You're way better off in the government's eyes than just giving them free rein

1625
00:41:57.260 --> 00:41:57.830
here.

1626
00:41:57.830 --> 00:42:00.050
Have legalized prostitution here.

1627
00:42:00.110 --> 00:42:02.150
Have drugs decriminalized here.

1628
00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:06.410
Make your own choice when it comes to acid and mushrooms and Mescalero,

1629
00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:07.730
it's like you said about Ron Paul.

1630
00:42:07.731 --> 00:42:08.001
It's like,

1631
00:42:08.001 --> 00:42:08.181
you know,

1632
00:42:08.181 --> 00:42:08.931
people were surprised.

1633
00:42:08.931 --> 00:42:09.770
Obama got elected.

1634
00:42:09.771 --> 00:42:10.191
I'm not,

1635
00:42:10.191 --> 00:42:11.090
he's of the ILC.

1636
00:42:11.091 --> 00:42:12.090
He's a Harvard man.

1637
00:42:12.100 --> 00:42:13.130
Best top of his class.

1638
00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:14.990
It's all the things we ask of our president.

1639
00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:15.770
He was,

1640
00:42:15.770 --> 00:42:16.640
they just looked different,

1641
00:42:16.641 --> 00:42:19.370
but all the things we asked him and he didn't come and let you know,

1642
00:42:19.371 --> 00:42:19.791
like Clinton,

1643
00:42:19.791 --> 00:42:20.930
he was kind of a self made guy,

1644
00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:22.520
but it's like he belonged there.

1645
00:42:22.660 --> 00:42:23.060
You know?

1646
00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:24.230
And even if you don't like to hear this,

1647
00:42:24.231 --> 00:42:25.040
George W.

1648
00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:26.120
Bush came from the ILC.

1649
00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:26.740
He wasn't,

1650
00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:27.110
you know,

1651
00:42:27.110 --> 00:42:28.010
maybe not the intelligence,

1652
00:42:28.011 --> 00:42:28.880
but he came from the hill.

1653
00:42:28.910 --> 00:42:29.743
You don't know.

1654
00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:32.390
Intelligence is a questionable thing.

1655
00:42:32.510 --> 00:42:33.410
And this is one.

1656
00:42:33.530 --> 00:42:36.980
Have you ever seen some of the videos when he was running for Governor of Texas?

1657
00:42:37.010 --> 00:42:37.161
No.

1658
00:42:37.161 --> 00:42:37.431
Sure.

1659
00:42:37.431 --> 00:42:38.600
But what we do is going to have to enrich.

1660
00:42:38.610 --> 00:42:40.280
We spoke occasionally.

1661
00:42:40.281 --> 00:42:40.451
You know,

1662
00:42:40.451 --> 00:42:42.590
he occasionally when we spoke about certain things,

1663
00:42:42.610 --> 00:42:43.010
yeah,

1664
00:42:43.010 --> 00:42:44.000
but you got to realize,

1665
00:42:44.001 --> 00:42:44.421
first of all,

1666
00:42:44.421 --> 00:42:49.250
these guys are working some insane amount of hours a day when George Bush was

1667
00:42:49.251 --> 00:42:51.500
campaigning for president and when he became president,

1668
00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:55.070
the hours at these fucking guys are accountable a day.

1669
00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:56.450
It must be staggering.

1670
00:42:56.451 --> 00:42:59.360
The pressure of being the president must be unbelievable.

1671
00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:02.450
So of course the guy's tired all the time and occasional let's say something

1672
00:43:02.451 --> 00:43:05.480
really stupid cause he's only using fucking half his brain,

1673
00:43:05.481 --> 00:43:06.800
half his brains out working right now.

1674
00:43:06.810 --> 00:43:08.510
That's why it's like I never questioned.

1675
00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:09.351
I just don't look.

1676
00:43:09.351 --> 00:43:09.561
I,

1677
00:43:09.561 --> 00:43:10.221
I think,

1678
00:43:10.221 --> 00:43:12.650
do you ever see the videos of him when he was running for governor?

1679
00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:15.330
It would speak Spanish a lot to remember that.

1680
00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:15.771
He really,

1681
00:43:15.771 --> 00:43:15.891
yeah,

1682
00:43:15.891 --> 00:43:17.300
he speaks Spanish pretty fluently.

1683
00:43:17.301 --> 00:43:17.780
Uh,

1684
00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:18.230
uh,

1685
00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:20.390
I thought he took Anne Richards job right from her.

1686
00:43:20.391 --> 00:43:20.921
I think so.

1687
00:43:20.921 --> 00:43:21.711
It's very beloved.

1688
00:43:21.711 --> 00:43:22.610
But she was a democrat.

1689
00:43:22.611 --> 00:43:23.181
Very rare.

1690
00:43:23.181 --> 00:43:24.140
But she was still like,

1691
00:43:24.141 --> 00:43:27.170
I'll pull that the electric chair and I'll put you in it.

1692
00:43:27.171 --> 00:43:28.280
But she was kind of bad.

1693
00:43:28.281 --> 00:43:29.360
I got an Annie Oakley.

1694
00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:31.490
I would love if we had a governor like that.

1695
00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:31.940
Yeah.

1696
00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:33.440
There was something about that chick.

1697
00:43:33.441 --> 00:43:33.621
I mean,

1698
00:43:33.621 --> 00:43:36.680
I don't know what her policies where if I would've agreed with everything,

1699
00:43:36.681 --> 00:43:38.120
but I'd love the character.

1700
00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:39.680
I know it's tough.

1701
00:43:39.930 --> 00:43:40.660
Texas,

1702
00:43:40.660 --> 00:43:41.493
Texas politics,

1703
00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:43.070
but she was pretty bad ass,

1704
00:43:43.071 --> 00:43:44.090
but he took her over.

1705
00:43:44.091 --> 00:43:45.980
So it's like he was good in the beginning,

1706
00:43:45.981 --> 00:43:46.340
man.

1707
00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:46.681
Yeah.

1708
00:43:46.681 --> 00:43:46.911
You know,

1709
00:43:46.911 --> 00:43:48.200
if you listen to him talk,

1710
00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:49.221
you know when people say,

1711
00:43:49.221 --> 00:43:49.731
oh well,

1712
00:43:49.731 --> 00:43:50.061
you know,

1713
00:43:50.061 --> 00:43:51.870
he fucking owned part of the,

1714
00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:52.231
the,

1715
00:43:52.231 --> 00:43:53.750
the Houston was an Astros.

1716
00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:54.490
Who the owner.

1717
00:43:54.490 --> 00:43:54.830
Yeah,

1718
00:43:54.830 --> 00:43:57.170
he only Houston Astros and they all fucking,

1719
00:43:57.171 --> 00:43:57.831
it all fell apart.

1720
00:43:57.831 --> 00:43:59.180
Like everything he touched fell apart.

1721
00:43:59.181 --> 00:43:59.600
Like,

1722
00:43:59.600 --> 00:43:59.841
hey,

1723
00:43:59.841 --> 00:44:00.950
it's hard out there bro.

1724
00:44:00.970 --> 00:44:01.150
Yeah.

1725
00:44:01.150 --> 00:44:01.320
It's,

1726
00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:02.001
it's hard out there.

1727
00:44:02.001 --> 00:44:02.960
Hard out there for an air.

1728
00:44:03.050 --> 00:44:05.900
I think that what George Bush provided us with a very,

1729
00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:06.350
um,

1730
00:44:06.350 --> 00:44:09.590
unique insight into what the being the president is really all about.

1731
00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:15.220
George Bush was the first guy where I got to look at the president in office and

1732
00:44:15.801 --> 00:44:15.951
go,

1733
00:44:15.951 --> 00:44:16.784
okay,

1734
00:44:16.910 --> 00:44:19.970
it's clearly they're not letting this guy run this.

1735
00:44:20.050 --> 00:44:20.710
Right.

1736
00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:22.040
It's as clear as fucking po.

1737
00:44:22.070 --> 00:44:23.420
You couldn't make it any more clear.

1738
00:44:23.421 --> 00:44:25.640
Every time there would be some shit that would go down.

1739
00:44:25.850 --> 00:44:27.680
You would talk about Dick Cheney being in the bunker.

1740
00:44:28.070 --> 00:44:30.980
It would be the Dick Cheney is out in the bunker somewhere like Dick Cheney's in

1741
00:44:31.050 --> 00:44:31.351
bunker.

1742
00:44:31.351 --> 00:44:32.220
Where's Bush Bushes

1743
00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:33.120
<v 0>on the roof?</v>

1744
00:44:33.290 --> 00:44:33.540
Uh,

1745
00:44:33.540 --> 00:44:36.810
standing in the middle of a red circle and a white circles around it.

1746
00:44:37.540 --> 00:44:39.030
They didn't give a fuck about him.

1747
00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:40.980
They were worried about protecting Cheney.

1748
00:44:41.010 --> 00:44:41.401
It was a,

1749
00:44:41.401 --> 00:44:42.660
it's all that gangster politics.

1750
00:44:42.661 --> 00:44:43.021
There's that,

1751
00:44:43.021 --> 00:44:45.300
that the documentary on right now put Atwater,

1752
00:44:45.301 --> 00:44:46.770
who's that campaign at the biggest,

1753
00:44:46.771 --> 00:44:48.930
most famous campaign manager ever?

1754
00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:49.681
Atwater.

1755
00:44:49.681 --> 00:44:50.221
What's his first name?

1756
00:44:50.221 --> 00:44:51.460
He's a Republican strategist.

1757
00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:52.660
Uh,

1758
00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:54.360
he like talk tot Karl Rove,

1759
00:44:54.361 --> 00:44:55.230
how to be a gangster.

1760
00:44:55.231 --> 00:44:56.370
You know what I really like?

1761
00:44:56.371 --> 00:44:56.670
Uh,

1762
00:44:56.670 --> 00:44:58.020
he was a real architect of it,

1763
00:44:58.021 --> 00:45:00.780
but he was the one hit and it goes back on a scale of one to 10.

1764
00:45:00.781 --> 00:45:01.860
How gays call row.

1765
00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:02.281
Oh,

1766
00:45:02.281 --> 00:45:02.601
he's,

1767
00:45:02.601 --> 00:45:02.931
he's,

1768
00:45:02.931 --> 00:45:03.930
he's 15,

1769
00:45:03.931 --> 00:45:04.320
60,

1770
00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:05.640
like Marcus Bachmann gang.

1771
00:45:05.641 --> 00:45:08.870
He's handjobs behind Kinko's gay at one thing.

1772
00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:12.480
You think so you don't think he's got some dude just locked in a basement

1773
00:45:12.481 --> 00:45:14.370
somewhere and sucking his dick every Tuesday.

1774
00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:16.230
Oh yeah.

1775
00:45:16.310 --> 00:45:17.143
He's got some,

1776
00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:20.010
he's got some fucking guy that and on my face for a moment.

1777
00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:20.551
Yeah.

1778
00:45:20.551 --> 00:45:21.270
He's,

1779
00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:25.470
he takes care of this guy and some locked apartment with assassin's outside of

1780
00:45:25.471 --> 00:45:26.800
every door to they're evil,

1781
00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:27.871
evil people.

1782
00:45:27.871 --> 00:45:28.200
I was,

1783
00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:29.490
this guy just screams forum.

1784
00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:34.260
You fucking bitch you to come over here so I can suck your cock and get my

1785
00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:35.640
weekly job.

1786
00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:40.590
This poor guy just living in a basement waiting for Karl Rove to come over and

1787
00:45:40.591 --> 00:45:42.960
fuck his mouth and then leave God.

1788
00:45:43.050 --> 00:45:43.861
But those guys,

1789
00:45:43.861 --> 00:45:44.250
they know,

1790
00:45:44.250 --> 00:45:44.971
they know what to show.

1791
00:45:44.971 --> 00:45:47.370
You show him this and then tell him to just show him something.

1792
00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:47.881
Brilliant.

1793
00:45:47.881 --> 00:45:48.151
Believe.

1794
00:45:48.151 --> 00:45:48.510
Yeah,

1795
00:45:48.510 --> 00:45:49.380
he's a monster.

1796
00:45:49.381 --> 00:45:50.820
That guy is a monster.

1797
00:45:50.821 --> 00:45:51.091
You,

1798
00:45:51.091 --> 00:45:51.924
you watched the,

1799
00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:52.360
the,

1800
00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:57.090
the documentaries talking about him and how he fucking figured out how to pull

1801
00:45:57.091 --> 00:45:58.800
the strings behind the Bush administration.

1802
00:45:58.830 --> 00:46:03.830
He's a master of it all about making a guy like John Kerry look like a pussy for

1803
00:46:03.961 --> 00:46:05.940
having volunteered for Vietnam.

1804
00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:08.010
They made him look like a pussy.

1805
00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:13.160
They're genius and how they dissect hats off the whole Bush administration was

1806
00:46:13.381 --> 00:46:15.660
so twisted because they had that guy,

1807
00:46:15.690 --> 00:46:16.501
Jeff Gannon,

1808
00:46:16.501 --> 00:46:20.370
that prostitute the gay prostitute who was the embedded White House reporter

1809
00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:21.750
going after or before.

1810
00:46:21.751 --> 00:46:23.730
These guys didn't understand the Internet.

1811
00:46:23.790 --> 00:46:24.060
Right.

1812
00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:24.930
They didn't get it.

1813
00:46:24.931 --> 00:46:28.440
Which is amazing to think that just just in the bushes administration,

1814
00:46:28.530 --> 00:46:30.720
they didn't get the internet just of back off.

1815
00:46:30.870 --> 00:46:30.961
Well,

1816
00:46:30.961 --> 00:46:34.200
there was a guy who he would lie about these softball questions.

1817
00:46:34.201 --> 00:46:35.034
You remember?

1818
00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:35.510
Absolutely.

1819
00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:36.120
We're him.

1820
00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:36.570
He would go,

1821
00:46:36.570 --> 00:46:37.980
or the story of Mr President,

1822
00:46:37.981 --> 00:46:42.240
when are the Democrats just going to come to their senses and realize that they

1823
00:46:42.241 --> 00:46:43.680
live in a fantasy land?

1824
00:46:43.850 --> 00:46:46.770
Like that was a question to ask and then the real reporters would be like,

1825
00:46:46.771 --> 00:46:48.390
who is this motherfucker like,

1826
00:46:48.570 --> 00:46:49.680
what's going on here?

1827
00:46:49.681 --> 00:46:50.580
They were like looking at this guy,

1828
00:46:50.581 --> 00:46:52.770
trying to study them and so then they um,

1829
00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:55.920
they started doing an investigation on him and they found out that he had some

1830
00:46:56.130 --> 00:47:01.130
gay military escort service where it was like him with dog tags on with a towel

1831
00:47:01.801 --> 00:47:04.800
over his cock and he's laying back and this was the embedded White House

1832
00:47:04.801 --> 00:47:08.580
reporter and this fucking website was Latin on God's Internet.

1833
00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:09.510
Anyone can get on it.

1834
00:47:09.511 --> 00:47:10.950
Just www,

1835
00:47:11.490 --> 00:47:12.990
horny army Cox or something.

1836
00:47:12.991 --> 00:47:13.590
Dot.

1837
00:47:13.590 --> 00:47:18.360
Completely Aloof to as a gay escorts or he was a gay escort and he was living

1838
00:47:18.540 --> 00:47:18.811
like,

1839
00:47:18.811 --> 00:47:20.490
I mean he was an embedded White House reporter.

1840
00:47:20.491 --> 00:47:21.120
He's actually in,

1841
00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:23.400
stayed overnight once at the White House.

1842
00:47:23.460 --> 00:47:26.050
He slept at the White House and the Lincoln Bedroom.

1843
00:47:26.460 --> 00:47:27.000
Who's,

1844
00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:27.900
who is that call?

1845
00:47:27.901 --> 00:47:28.470
Rose boy,

1846
00:47:28.470 --> 00:47:28.680
man.

1847
00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:29.410
What's going on?

1848
00:47:29.410 --> 00:47:29.870
Oh,

1849
00:47:29.870 --> 00:47:30.050
there's

1850
00:47:30.050 --> 00:47:30.670
<v 1>somebody,</v>

1851
00:47:30.670 --> 00:47:32.800
somebody fucking some deck guy sucking somebody deck.

1852
00:47:33.010 --> 00:47:33.620
Okay.

1853
00:47:33.620 --> 00:47:34.690
What's going on there?

1854
00:47:34.750 --> 00:47:38.650
That whole presidency was so kinky handjobs and a reach around skill floor.

1855
00:47:38.830 --> 00:47:39.700
Don't go down that hall.

1856
00:47:39.740 --> 00:47:42.340
There's so kinky because it was all suppressive.

1857
00:47:42.341 --> 00:47:42.580
Yeah,

1858
00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:43.211
it was all,

1859
00:47:43.211 --> 00:47:43.481
you know,

1860
00:47:43.481 --> 00:47:44.680
they didn't want gay marriage.

1861
00:47:44.710 --> 00:47:45.461
They didn't want this.

1862
00:47:45.461 --> 00:47:47.690
They didn't want that like that conservative,

1863
00:47:48.190 --> 00:47:52.300
but to be so creepy and so suppressive,

1864
00:47:52.420 --> 00:47:55.540
most of the people that are really suppressive and creepy like that,

1865
00:47:55.630 --> 00:47:58.630
they're afraid of it in themselves or they're finding it in themselves.

1866
00:47:58.810 --> 00:48:03.810
So if you look at an administration that was marked by this kind of like creepy,

1867
00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:05.650
overly conservative,

1868
00:48:05.651 --> 00:48:06.760
overly Christian,

1869
00:48:06.761 --> 00:48:08.650
overly invasive sex,

1870
00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:09.670
what was going on with that?

1871
00:48:09.671 --> 00:48:10.330
What was that?

1872
00:48:10.330 --> 00:48:12.070
You know what it was was that they were just fucking,

1873
00:48:12.071 --> 00:48:13.630
and they just wanted to keep all the heat off of them.

1874
00:48:13.930 --> 00:48:14.741
We need to stop this,

1875
00:48:14.741 --> 00:48:15.574
but fucking,

1876
00:48:15.630 --> 00:48:15.970
no,

1877
00:48:15.970 --> 00:48:16.920
they just can't stop.

1878
00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:17.411
But fuck,

1879
00:48:17.411 --> 00:48:19.440
I know you don't never know who they're going to find.

1880
00:48:19.830 --> 00:48:23.790
They're going to find bloody under Roos and his fucking closet is Joel Olsteen.

1881
00:48:23.810 --> 00:48:24.001
Dude,

1882
00:48:24.001 --> 00:48:25.480
they're going to want Joe Olsteen,

1883
00:48:25.481 --> 00:48:26.610
Joel Ost O'steen,

1884
00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:27.340
which was that.

1885
00:48:27.340 --> 00:48:28.690
He's like the mega church guy.

1886
00:48:28.691 --> 00:48:29.141
Like he,

1887
00:48:29.141 --> 00:48:30.870
I say real creepy smile lock,

1888
00:48:30.871 --> 00:48:35.500
stock lowered and it has like 18,000 parishioners that is mega church in fucking

1889
00:48:35.501 --> 00:48:38.800
Texas and they go out there and think about if they're all paying him just a

1890
00:48:38.801 --> 00:48:39.670
buck to be there.

1891
00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:41.710
He's doing a nice Improv Gig,

1892
00:48:41.711 --> 00:48:42.430
headlining.

1893
00:48:42.430 --> 00:48:42.731
No,

1894
00:48:42.731 --> 00:48:46.420
they're all paying him a hundred bucks each to be there and he's cleaning up

1895
00:48:46.450 --> 00:48:46.531
there.

1896
00:48:46.531 --> 00:48:48.160
That's why it's like guys,

1897
00:48:48.161 --> 00:48:50.440
it's like rush Limbaugh and you'll see guys,

1898
00:48:50.441 --> 00:48:51.220
they're slowly,

1899
00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:51.701
Glenn Beck,

1900
00:48:51.701 --> 00:48:52.534
perfect example.

1901
00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:55.900
He slowly moving its way into the religious sect to the point where in the

1902
00:48:55.901 --> 00:48:57.550
religious sec you're protected by the religion.

1903
00:48:57.551 --> 00:48:59.470
You can say anything you want in the money.

1904
00:48:59.670 --> 00:49:02.590
You don't have to adhere to all that PC bullshit cause fox,

1905
00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:03.330
he can't,

1906
00:49:03.330 --> 00:49:04.630
if Fox is way too,

1907
00:49:04.810 --> 00:49:05.591
you know he,

1908
00:49:05.591 --> 00:49:07.030
he needs to let go back.

1909
00:49:07.031 --> 00:49:10.780
He wants to go talk about fags and niggers and spics and all the shit he wants

1910
00:49:10.781 --> 00:49:11.201
to say.

1911
00:49:11.201 --> 00:49:13.960
All the horrible things that even Fox won't let them say.

1912
00:49:14.140 --> 00:49:15.910
So now it's like if he's a religious guy,

1913
00:49:15.911 --> 00:49:17.770
if he's a religious not he can have his coat,

1914
00:49:17.771 --> 00:49:18.371
his followers,

1915
00:49:18.371 --> 00:49:20.110
and it's all under the guise of the Lord.

1916
00:49:20.430 --> 00:49:21.670
You know as people always do.

1917
00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:22.061
Have you,

1918
00:49:22.061 --> 00:49:22.361
Lord,

1919
00:49:22.361 --> 00:49:25.330
have you been to any Santa clause but you don't even have to pay taxes.

1920
00:49:25.331 --> 00:49:26.340
That's the craziest thing about it.

1921
00:49:26.350 --> 00:49:27.580
In China for religion,

1922
00:49:27.581 --> 00:49:28.640
you don't got to pay taxes.

1923
00:49:28.660 --> 00:49:29.493
It's

1924
00:49:29.620 --> 00:49:31.990
<v 2>have you been following the White House Twitter?</v>

1925
00:49:32.050 --> 00:49:32.420

1928
00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:35.350
Rick rolled somebody the other day.

1929
00:49:35.710 --> 00:49:38.770

1930
00:49:38.771 --> 00:49:40.540
Rick Roll someone in the White House.

1931
00:49:40.541 --> 00:49:42.430

1932
00:49:44.220 --> 00:49:46.360

1933

1936
00:49:50.741 --> 00:49:51.521
I'm like thinking,

1937
00:49:51.521 --> 00:49:52.354
wow there.

1938
00:49:52.460 --> 00:49:54.580
They're out of control at the White House.

1939
00:49:54.581 --> 00:49:54.941
Twitter.

1940
00:49:54.941 --> 00:49:56.110
They should not be like,

1941
00:49:56.170 --> 00:49:59.020
you know what the fuck on on the White House.

1942
00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:00.070
They say WTF.

1943
00:50:00.100 --> 00:50:00.371
Yeah.

1944
00:50:00.371 --> 00:50:00.791

1946
00:50:02.051 --> 00:50:02.830

1947
00:50:02.830 --> 00:50:03.663
That's pretty dope.

1948
00:50:03.850 --> 00:50:04.940
Oh yeah.

1949
00:50:05.740 --> 00:50:06.090
I mean,

1950
00:50:06.090 --> 00:50:06.881
when you think about it,

1951
00:50:06.881 --> 00:50:07.121
man,

1952
00:50:07.121 --> 00:50:07.421
look,

1953
00:50:07.421 --> 00:50:08.111
there's this guy,

1954
00:50:08.111 --> 00:50:10.270
Obama is only like a few years older than I am.

1955
00:50:10.990 --> 00:50:11.651
I'm 43,

1956
00:50:11.651 --> 00:50:12.910

1961
00:50:17.431 --> 00:50:18.010
I'm following.

1962
00:50:18.010 --> 00:50:18.430
He's still not,

1963
00:50:18.430 --> 00:50:19.310
I don't know what that means.

1964
00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:21.960
So I'm on some FBI watch list.

1965
00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:25.360
I think we said something about privacy now you layer has way more hits than the

1966
00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:26.040
White House does.

1967
00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:26.500
Really?

1968
00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:26.770
Yeah.

1969
00:50:26.770 --> 00:50:27.710
Way More followers.

1970
00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:33.000
<v 3>Buddy from Ohio called me and he was talking about this guy that used to live</v>

1971
00:50:33.001 --> 00:50:33.730
with him.

1972
00:50:33.730 --> 00:50:34.890
He and this guy was like,

1973
00:50:34.891 --> 00:50:37.770
one of those guys would always bring home crazy bitches like the chicks that

1974
00:50:37.771 --> 00:50:37.951
are,

1975
00:50:37.951 --> 00:50:38.311
you know,

1976
00:50:38.311 --> 00:50:40.350
like getting wasted and domestic violence type,

1977
00:50:40.351 --> 00:50:41.730
like psycho crazy girls.

1978
00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:42.331
Anyways,

1979
00:50:42.331 --> 00:50:44.280
he got married and uh,

1980
00:50:44.281 --> 00:50:49.281
they went to a wedding and his wife got completely hammered and fucked up and

1981
00:50:49.981 --> 00:50:53.400
started hitting him and doing all this crazy shit at somebody else's wedding.

1982
00:50:53.610 --> 00:50:56.220
Went into her car and wouldn't like get out of the car.

1983
00:50:56.340 --> 00:51:00.600
So they called the cops and the cops came and wouldn't get out of the car and

1984
00:51:00.601 --> 00:51:04.160
suddenly like they had to pull her out and she pulls out her boob and starts

1985
00:51:04.161 --> 00:51:09.090
squirting breast milk on the cob and now she's like hit with five charges,

1986
00:51:09.091 --> 00:51:11.270
including assault on an officer and like,

1987
00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:11.700
uh,

1988
00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:15.750
Ohio has this law against bodily fluids as a weapon and stuff like that.

1989
00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:17.250
So now she's got at least,

1990
00:51:17.310 --> 00:51:17.730

1991
00:51:17.730 --> 00:51:20.150
So now she's got like a fifth degree felony and,

1992
00:51:20.190 --> 00:51:20.621
and all that.

1993
00:51:20.621 --> 00:51:20.820
Sure.

1994
00:51:20.820 --> 00:51:23.970
I have like a squirting flower titty milk from a crippled nipple.

1995
00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:25.753
<v 1>I,</v>

1996
00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:27.350
I'm really disappointed.

1997
00:51:27.351 --> 00:51:29.330
The Kristina Agular is Twitter numbers.

1998
00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:32.400
Why they're only 536,000 oh relationship.

1999
00:51:32.590 --> 00:51:33.550
<v 3>Have you seen her lately?</v>

2000
00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:33.961
So she,

2001
00:51:33.961 --> 00:51:36.100
I saw her last night on Jay Leno or something.

2002
00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:37.030
What happened?

2003
00:51:37.030 --> 00:51:37.780
She's big.

2004
00:51:37.780 --> 00:51:38.500
She's gotten big.

2005
00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:39.191
<v 1>Listen Bro,</v>

2006
00:51:39.191 --> 00:51:41.050
she's not feeling good about life right now.

2007
00:51:41.250 --> 00:51:41.790
Big Plumbing.

2008
00:51:41.790 --> 00:51:42.710
She's a Amanda.

2009
00:51:42.730 --> 00:51:43.061
Slow,

2010
00:51:43.061 --> 00:51:43.894
closer,

2011
00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:44.471
slow,

2012
00:51:44.471 --> 00:51:47.170
kiss her and go down on her and make her feel better and hug her and go to

2013
00:51:47.171 --> 00:51:48.970
movies with her and just not getting that right now.

2014
00:51:49.030 --> 00:51:50.680
Now I feel a bit lonely.

2015
00:51:50.750 --> 00:51:51.490
She needs to get done.

2016
00:51:51.490 --> 00:51:54.460
Go real fucking so it gets straight.

2017
00:51:54.461 --> 00:51:55.241
Congo wax.

2018
00:51:55.241 --> 00:51:55.620
Yeah.

2019
00:51:55.620 --> 00:51:56.590
Just give me a call.

2020
00:51:58.480 --> 00:51:58.981
Freddy Loc.

2021
00:51:58.981 --> 00:51:59.140
Right?

2022
00:51:59.140 --> 00:52:01.780
You got so much fucking facial hair going on right now.

2023
00:52:01.781 --> 00:52:02.101
You look,

2024
00:52:02.101 --> 00:52:02.800
you look to girls,

2025
00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:04.240
you must just reek of man.

2026
00:52:05.030 --> 00:52:06.490
He's just a furry geese.

2027
00:52:06.810 --> 00:52:07.990
You're a furry animal too.

2028
00:52:07.991 --> 00:52:08.711
Fucking crazy.

2029
00:52:08.711 --> 00:52:10.470
Pharaoh's appeared for the men who can't.

2030
00:52:10.590 --> 00:52:11.740
When I see those who can't,

2031
00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:13.210
I laugh at yeah,

2032
00:52:13.220 --> 00:52:14.550
right now where I'm filming fear factor.

2033
00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:15.393
I can't have a beard.

2034
00:52:16.060 --> 00:52:16.780
I should shave.

2035
00:52:16.780 --> 00:52:17.531
It's the best way.

2036
00:52:17.531 --> 00:52:18.980
Don't you think so gay about it?

2037
00:52:19.090 --> 00:52:20.950
To have a beard is the easiest way.

2038
00:52:20.951 --> 00:52:22.810
Cause if they call you and say we need you with this or that,

2039
00:52:22.811 --> 00:52:23.680
you can shave it down.

2040
00:52:23.681 --> 00:52:24.240
But yeah,

2041
00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:24.390
beer,

2042
00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:25.121
it's the natural,

2043
00:52:25.121 --> 00:52:26.080
easiest way for me.

2044
00:52:26.350 --> 00:52:27.280
Well it's comfortable.

2045
00:52:28.090 --> 00:52:29.410
It makes me feel like I'm a man.

2046
00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:30.333
I keep it.

2047
00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:32.530
<v 3>I hate my face when it's not.</v>

2048
00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:34.600
When I shave it looked like I like now I'm like,

2049
00:52:34.601 --> 00:52:34.871
wow,

2050
00:52:34.871 --> 00:52:36.020
I like the beard more than I,

2051
00:52:36.250 --> 00:52:38.740
<v 1>my two main real estate between my nose and my lip here,</v>

2052
00:52:39.390 --> 00:52:40.660
a conversation.

2053
00:52:40.690 --> 00:52:42.600
This is proof that were queer and I was getting,

2054
00:52:42.620 --> 00:52:44.200
if I have a boner and tight jeans,

2055
00:52:44.210 --> 00:52:44.600
right.

2056
00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:45.433
That's what's gay.

2057
00:52:46.180 --> 00:52:47.013
Yeah.

2058
00:52:47.320 --> 00:52:47.501
Hey,

2059
00:52:47.501 --> 00:52:48.191
you guys like boners?

2060
00:52:48.191 --> 00:52:49.024
I probably,

2061
00:52:51.630 --> 00:52:54.070
what was this thing that you were telling me about that you were reading?

2062
00:52:54.071 --> 00:52:54.761
We were in the kitchen.

2063
00:52:54.761 --> 00:52:56.170
I said save this for the podcast.

2064
00:52:56.350 --> 00:52:58.960
Some mind control fucking book.

2065
00:52:59.470 --> 00:53:01.010
Some book about people fucking with your mind,

2066
00:53:01.980 --> 00:53:02.950
like your enemies,

2067
00:53:02.951 --> 00:53:04.270
like people don't know what to have the enemies.

2068
00:53:05.070 --> 00:53:07.660
Where was this is the book the book mind control?

2069
00:53:07.661 --> 00:53:07.860
They do.

2070
00:53:07.860 --> 00:53:08.370
It's called reading.

2071
00:53:08.370 --> 00:53:08.600
Writing.

2072
00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:09.433
It's called mind control.

2073
00:53:09.540 --> 00:53:10.373
Who Do you know?

2074
00:53:11.590 --> 00:53:12.310
Kimmy young.

2075
00:53:12.310 --> 00:53:13.460
I believe it is mine.

2076
00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:14.221
Control by Kim.

2077
00:53:14.221 --> 00:53:15.490
Your line control by Kim Young.

2078
00:53:15.491 --> 00:53:17.290
I put it out on Twitter before,

2079
00:53:17.590 --> 00:53:18.940
but it's not one of these where it's like,

2080
00:53:18.941 --> 00:53:19.151
hey,

2081
00:53:19.151 --> 00:53:20.140
here's how you can get the edge.

2082
00:53:20.140 --> 00:53:21.190
It's just one of these where it's like,

2083
00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:24.160
here's how people see things and you can see it like this way if you want to,

2084
00:53:24.161 --> 00:53:25.000
but you don't have to,

2085
00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:26.160
but you do have enemies.

2086
00:53:26.161 --> 00:53:27.690
Let's call them th the tractors,

2087
00:53:27.691 --> 00:53:29.250
let's call them whatever we need to call them.

2088
00:53:29.460 --> 00:53:30.390
But you do have people,

2089
00:53:30.391 --> 00:53:33.300
like we were talking about people earlier who wish you ill will,

2090
00:53:33.620 --> 00:53:36.050
because I'm aloof to that cause I don't wish to the Mll,

2091
00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:36.620
I,

2092
00:53:36.620 --> 00:53:38.010
I'm not aware of that.

2093
00:53:38.250 --> 00:53:38.940
These people can't,

2094
00:53:38.940 --> 00:53:40.550
can be out there and you know,

2095
00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:42.990
trying to plant things and I don't want to get paranoid about it.

2096
00:53:42.991 --> 00:53:43.320
Right.

2097
00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:46.590
But they will work to better themselves by solely in your progress.

2098
00:53:46.830 --> 00:53:49.710
But all in all you can do is the best weapon is be better than him.

2099
00:53:49.770 --> 00:53:53.570
Infinitely knowing that you're better than them and they fucking hate that know,

2100
00:53:53.930 --> 00:53:54.870
not even man.

2101
00:53:54.870 --> 00:53:58.110
I think the best weapon is she's just to be positive and living well.

2102
00:53:58.270 --> 00:53:58.550
Yeah.

2103
00:53:58.550 --> 00:53:58.981
Yeah.

2104
00:53:58.981 --> 00:53:59.521
And you know what,

2105
00:53:59.521 --> 00:54:01.950
every now and then you're going to have to point it out every now and then.

2106
00:54:01.951 --> 00:54:03.390
If it gets annoying and he gets in the way,

2107
00:54:03.391 --> 00:54:06.510
you're going to have to expose it and people can see that that's a negative

2108
00:54:06.511 --> 00:54:06.781
thing.

2109
00:54:06.781 --> 00:54:07.620
And it definitely is,

2110
00:54:07.790 --> 00:54:08.160
you know,

2111
00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:09.420
it's definitely,

2112
00:54:09.540 --> 00:54:11.540
no much less energy is,

2113
00:54:11.770 --> 00:54:12.121
you know,

2114
00:54:12.121 --> 00:54:13.170
is is transferred.

2115
00:54:13.171 --> 00:54:15.480
That's negative if you just turn the other cheek and walk away from it.

2116
00:54:15.780 --> 00:54:17.670
But at a certain point in time you have a,

2117
00:54:17.671 --> 00:54:21.840
an obligation as a human being involved in a community to establish a certain

2118
00:54:21.841 --> 00:54:22.920
level of behavior,

2119
00:54:23.100 --> 00:54:23.460
you know,

2120
00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:28.460
in a friendly level and knowing human nature and knowing the people if allowed

2121
00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:32.880
to can get very fucking self centered and be really shitty to each other.

2122
00:54:32.910 --> 00:54:33.240
Right.

2123
00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:35.820
And the only reason why they're doing it is because no one's checking them.

2124
00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:39.360
They either they don't have good friends or they don't have people that are

2125
00:54:39.361 --> 00:54:40.300
rational around them.

2126
00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:43.220
It just had the balls to step up and and going,

2127
00:54:43.240 --> 00:54:43.501
dude,

2128
00:54:43.501 --> 00:54:44.334
you're being a cunt.

2129
00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:45.131
That simple.

2130
00:54:45.131 --> 00:54:46.290
You need peers in life,

2131
00:54:46.590 --> 00:54:47.520
social network,

2132
00:54:47.550 --> 00:54:50.010
peers and I mean physical ones not on the computer,

2133
00:54:50.011 --> 00:54:54.060
I mean physical peers or or that's where your checks and balances come from.

2134
00:54:54.270 --> 00:54:57.450
That's why you stopped believing in Santa and shit like that because of your

2135
00:54:57.451 --> 00:54:58.231
fucking peers,

2136
00:54:58.231 --> 00:54:58.530
you know,

2137
00:54:58.530 --> 00:55:01.140
they wise you up or they can bring you down but it can bring you,

2138
00:55:01.141 --> 00:55:02.400
do you know if you're hanging around I'll,

2139
00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:03.840
I'll bounce if you're negative.

2140
00:55:04.140 --> 00:55:05.340
I got no fucking time.

2141
00:55:05.341 --> 00:55:06.150
You will,

2142
00:55:06.150 --> 00:55:06.490
we go,

2143
00:55:06.490 --> 00:55:08.160
we got one go around at this life.

2144
00:55:08.161 --> 00:55:09.180
I'm not a religious dude.

2145
00:55:09.181 --> 00:55:12.070
So I'm like this is it and I'm going to make the most of it and I'm going to

2146
00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:15.390
learn as much as I can do and I will levitate some day and I will find big.

2147
00:55:15.660 --> 00:55:16.650
We all agree,

2148
00:55:16.651 --> 00:55:16.921
we,

2149
00:55:16.921 --> 00:55:21.720
all of us that roll together really have that same sort of sensibility when it

2150
00:55:21.721 --> 00:55:22.554
comes to things,

2151
00:55:22.830 --> 00:55:23.131
you know?

2152
00:55:23.131 --> 00:55:23.970
And I think there's,

2153
00:55:23.971 --> 00:55:26.100
there's only one way to go through this life.

2154
00:55:26.130 --> 00:55:27.330
You can choose to be happy.

2155
00:55:27.420 --> 00:55:27.751
Yeah.

2156
00:55:27.751 --> 00:55:28.950
It's a choice to have fun.

2157
00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:29.191
I mean,

2158
00:55:29.191 --> 00:55:31.230
unless you guys have a serious brain issue that you really need to go to a

2159
00:55:31.231 --> 00:55:31.980
doctor for,

2160
00:55:31.980 --> 00:55:32.341
you can,

2161
00:55:32.341 --> 00:55:33.360
you can choose to it.

2162
00:55:33.570 --> 00:55:35.670
You can choose to set your sails in a,

2163
00:55:35.671 --> 00:55:36.720
in a positive direction.

2164
00:55:37.260 --> 00:55:39.750
And a lot of people just aren't fucking doing that cause they were around some

2165
00:55:39.810 --> 00:55:41.730
idiots that are eating up their time.

2166
00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:42.331
Right.

2167
00:55:42.331 --> 00:55:42.751
And you know,

2168
00:55:42.751 --> 00:55:43.890
what happens is most people,

2169
00:55:43.891 --> 00:55:45.880
they feel like whether it's after high school or college,

2170
00:55:45.881 --> 00:55:46.890
I no longer a student.

2171
00:55:46.920 --> 00:55:50.080
I think if you're a student and you keep learning and you keep your mind open,

2172
00:55:50.090 --> 00:55:54.270
now you're going to evolve and you're going to remain socially relevant.

2173
00:55:54.330 --> 00:55:54.451
Well,

2174
00:55:54.451 --> 00:55:54.751
you know,

2175
00:55:54.751 --> 00:55:56.580
I it a certain point in time I've,

2176
00:55:56.590 --> 00:55:59.610
I've thought that once I started doing standup comedy,

2177
00:55:59.611 --> 00:56:01.470
there's going to be a certain point in time where I really felt like a

2178
00:56:01.471 --> 00:56:02.304
professional.

2179
00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:02.611
You know,

2180
00:56:02.611 --> 00:56:06.420
in the beginning I really felt like I was running on ice skates and slipping all

2181
00:56:06.421 --> 00:56:10.020
over the place and I didn't have any solid ground and I would fall down and get

2182
00:56:10.021 --> 00:56:10.650
back up.

2183
00:56:10.650 --> 00:56:13.620
I wasn't convinced I would keep doing it or could keep doing it,

2184
00:56:13.621 --> 00:56:15.090
that I would get to a point of,

2185
00:56:15.450 --> 00:56:15.781
you know,

2186
00:56:15.781 --> 00:56:20.781
of expertise where I felt so comfortable that I could just relax and let go.

2187
00:56:20.850 --> 00:56:21.001
Right.

2188
00:56:21.001 --> 00:56:22.110
That was always the goal.

2189
00:56:22.230 --> 00:56:24.100
There's always the goal where would see a guy like,

2190
00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:25.001
<v 0>you know,</v>

2191
00:56:25.001 --> 00:56:29.440
whoever you name your really good comic on television,

2192
00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:30.940
you know Jerry Seinfeld,

2193
00:56:30.941 --> 00:56:31.361
whoever,

2194
00:56:31.361 --> 00:56:32.740
you know Eddie Murphy,

2195
00:56:32.741 --> 00:56:33.700
you'd see them on TV,

2196
00:56:33.730 --> 00:56:36.280
but like there's no fucking way I'll ever hit that level.

2197
00:56:36.281 --> 00:56:40.270
That guy is at this level of perfection where he could never not be funny.

2198
00:56:40.460 --> 00:56:41.293
He just in this,

2199
00:56:41.390 --> 00:56:43.660
this super powerful groove and I'm like,

2200
00:56:43.661 --> 00:56:43.991
man,

2201
00:56:43.991 --> 00:56:47.170
what must that feel like to be like totally done?

2202
00:56:47.290 --> 00:56:50.260
Like you're as good as you can ever get and you'd never have to worry about

2203
00:56:50.261 --> 00:56:50.921
comedy again.

2204
00:56:50.921 --> 00:56:53.410
He never get nervous before you go on stage because you're fucking Eddie Murphy,

2205
00:56:53.740 --> 00:56:56.350
but then you realize as you get older that that's not real.

2206
00:56:56.410 --> 00:56:57.460
It never really happens.

2207
00:56:57.650 --> 00:56:59.830
You always don't know what the fuck you're doing.

2208
00:56:59.920 --> 00:57:03.910
You always are constantly evolving and working on it and if you don't,

2209
00:57:03.940 --> 00:57:05.530
you're going to sock right.

2210
00:57:05.710 --> 00:57:06.071
If you,

2211
00:57:06.071 --> 00:57:09.430
if you're not always in the hunt and always in the struggle and always writing

2212
00:57:09.431 --> 00:57:10.960
and always thinking and always performing,

2213
00:57:11.110 --> 00:57:12.700
you're going to eat some dick up there,

2214
00:57:12.701 --> 00:57:13.031
dude,

2215
00:57:13.031 --> 00:57:13.864
if you're not really,

2216
00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:18.190
if you're not constantly improving and then you're going to f so you never feel

2217
00:57:18.191 --> 00:57:18.870
comfortable,

2218
00:57:18.870 --> 00:57:20.920
you've got to be comfortable and not being comfortable.

2219
00:57:21.100 --> 00:57:21.731
<v 1>Absolutely.</v>

2220
00:57:21.731 --> 00:57:22.250
And that's what it,

2221
00:57:22.250 --> 00:57:24.040
and it goes for all walks and not even just your career,

2222
00:57:24.041 --> 00:57:25.890
but it's like you've got to put yourself out there for everything,

2223
00:57:26.530 --> 00:57:27.320
for everything.

2224
00:57:27.320 --> 00:57:28.840
That's the only way you evolve.

2225
00:57:28.900 --> 00:57:29.200
You know,

2226
00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:29.781
my girlfriend,

2227
00:57:29.781 --> 00:57:32.770
and sometimes I'm guilty of being too mean to her sometimes because I have a low

2228
00:57:32.771 --> 00:57:34.330
threshold for whining and complaining.

2229
00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:35.141
I'm just like,

2230
00:57:35.141 --> 00:57:35.410
wait,

2231
00:57:35.410 --> 00:57:36.041
you're not retarded.

2232
00:57:36.041 --> 00:57:36.650
You're not four.

2233
00:57:36.650 --> 00:57:37.240
Figure it out.

2234
00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:37.490
You know?

2235
00:57:37.490 --> 00:57:37.620
And,

2236
00:57:37.620 --> 00:57:38.080
and again,

2237
00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:40.610
it's called the Penn Pan and absolutely give me some knuckles for that man.

2238
00:57:40.630 --> 00:57:41.463
I'm saying

2239
00:57:42.940 --> 00:57:44.140
this are rocking it like that.

2240
00:57:44.141 --> 00:57:47.620
It's a lot of bitches out there that are quitting racket ball because the wife

2241
00:57:47.621 --> 00:57:48.850
wants that extra hour with you.

2242
00:57:48.910 --> 00:57:49.180
Yeah.

2243
00:57:49.180 --> 00:57:49.750
And it's like,

2244
00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:50.980
here's the thing in my whole thing

2245
00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:54.350
<v 0>Hackaball I don't know where that came from.</v>

2246
00:57:54.590 --> 00:57:55.423
<v 1>So what is she doing?</v>

2247
00:57:55.500 --> 00:57:57.510
But it's like is she said she's great and she knows this,

2248
00:57:57.511 --> 00:57:57.961
but it's like,

2249
00:57:57.961 --> 00:57:58.411
you know me,

2250
00:57:58.411 --> 00:57:58.950
it's like I,

2251
00:57:58.950 --> 00:58:00.060
if you know,

2252
00:58:00.090 --> 00:58:02.250
if you're an adult and you're whining or complaining to me,

2253
00:58:02.490 --> 00:58:03.780
I'll go off on you.

2254
00:58:03.781 --> 00:58:04.351
If you're a kid,

2255
00:58:04.351 --> 00:58:04.711
I'll get it.

2256
00:58:04.711 --> 00:58:05.341
It's like a kid.

2257
00:58:05.341 --> 00:58:05.481
You're,

2258
00:58:05.481 --> 00:58:06.240
you're new,

2259
00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:07.010
you're learning shit,

2260
00:58:07.010 --> 00:58:07.151
dude.

2261
00:58:07.151 --> 00:58:07.981
I tell my three year old,

2262
00:58:07.981 --> 00:58:08.814
stop whining.

2263
00:58:08.940 --> 00:58:09.691
It's just tough.

2264
00:58:09.691 --> 00:58:10.860
Dad would never let me whine.

2265
00:58:10.861 --> 00:58:11.480
He wouldn't do this.

2266
00:58:11.480 --> 00:58:11.730
I go,

2267
00:58:11.730 --> 00:58:12.470
this is ridiculous.

2268
00:58:12.470 --> 00:58:14.310
You need to keep repeating yourself over and over again.

2269
00:58:14.370 --> 00:58:14.571
Yeah.

2270
00:58:14.571 --> 00:58:15.120
Be Nice.

2271
00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:15.371
Yeah.

2272
00:58:15.371 --> 00:58:17.430
It's just like you can get some perspective and love everything,

2273
00:58:17.431 --> 00:58:20.160
but my girlfriend is super cool cause she's got to put with a Dick like me.

2274
00:58:20.161 --> 00:58:22.070
I'm like the Comic Book Guy of hip hop.

2275
00:58:22.071 --> 00:58:22.760
I'm a dick.

2276
00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:23.160
You know what I mean?

2277
00:58:23.160 --> 00:58:24.000
But you're not a dick.

2278
00:58:24.030 --> 00:58:24.870
You're a nice guy.

2279
00:58:25.080 --> 00:58:27.390
What you are is you're not tolerant of stupid shit.

2280
00:58:29.010 --> 00:58:31.740
I'm not tolerant of stupid shit from intelligent people.

2281
00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:32.633
Yes.

2282
00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:36.510
Where people will fall back into that mode yet really negative whining mode.

2283
00:58:36.520 --> 00:58:36.730
Yeah.

2284
00:58:36.730 --> 00:58:37.471
That's not good.

2285
00:58:37.471 --> 00:58:39.330
That's what sits unhealthiest fuck.

2286
00:58:39.360 --> 00:58:39.720
Yeah.

2287
00:58:39.720 --> 00:58:41.880
And anybody does it and she doesn't do that often.

2288
00:58:41.881 --> 00:58:42.790
It's just that some people,

2289
00:58:42.840 --> 00:58:43.231
when I do,

2290
00:58:43.231 --> 00:58:44.730
it's just like I turned into such a Dick.

2291
00:58:44.731 --> 00:58:46.590
If somebody fast man,

2292
00:58:46.591 --> 00:58:48.120
we have all these different modes.

2293
00:58:48.150 --> 00:58:48.840
We,

2294
00:58:48.840 --> 00:58:49.830
all of us,

2295
00:58:50.070 --> 00:58:51.900
we sort of imitate our environment.

2296
00:58:51.901 --> 00:58:55.740
We imitate our atmosphere and we lock into some sort of predetermined pattern

2297
00:58:56.010 --> 00:58:59.850
that we continue to follow through our life with little minimal changes here and

2298
00:58:59.851 --> 00:59:04.410
there because of horrible fuck ups when you like really get humiliated and then

2299
00:59:04.411 --> 00:59:05.490
you'd have to rebuild,

2300
00:59:05.520 --> 00:59:07.950
but don't you always see the forest through the trees and don't you always say,

2301
00:59:07.951 --> 00:59:08.131
look,

2302
00:59:08.131 --> 00:59:08.911
I'm not special.

2303
00:59:08.911 --> 00:59:10.500
People get broken up with all the time.

2304
00:59:10.770 --> 00:59:12.090
Marriages end all the time.

2305
00:59:12.100 --> 00:59:13.830
Deaths happened on timely all the time.

2306
00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:16.860
And so people would let one of these situations dictate their entire life.

2307
00:59:16.861 --> 00:59:19.140
Like they're the first person that ever happened to.

2308
00:59:19.320 --> 00:59:19.621
It's like,

2309
00:59:19.621 --> 00:59:19.861
look,

2310
00:59:19.861 --> 00:59:20.281
grieve,

2311
00:59:20.281 --> 00:59:22.070
feel bad feel for years if you have

2312
00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:22.460
<v 0>to,</v>

2313
00:59:22.460 --> 00:59:24.860
but eventually know this too shall fucking pass it.

2314
00:59:24.861 --> 00:59:25.640
Always done.

2315
00:59:25.640 --> 00:59:25.851
Yeah,

2316
00:59:25.851 --> 00:59:26.241
you can.

2317
00:59:26.241 --> 00:59:26.460
It's,

2318
00:59:26.460 --> 00:59:27.290
you could say that,

2319
00:59:27.290 --> 00:59:32.290
but actually intellectualizing that while you're in emotional pain is almost

2320
00:59:32.481 --> 00:59:33.141
impossible.

2321
00:59:33.141 --> 00:59:34.040
And that's the problem.

2322
00:59:34.041 --> 00:59:35.420
The problem is we're,

2323
00:59:35.510 --> 00:59:40.130
we're engineered to love each other whenever we're engineered to get things done

2324
00:59:40.131 --> 00:59:43.340
by being in tribes and being close to each other.

2325
00:59:43.670 --> 00:59:44.270
Yeah.

2326
00:59:44.270 --> 00:59:46.460
Being communal and sharing with each other,

2327
00:59:46.461 --> 00:59:48.620
like were engineered to love each other's company.

2328
00:59:48.830 --> 00:59:51.080
So when someone dumps you,

2329
00:59:51.410 --> 00:59:52.370
no matter what,

2330
00:59:52.371 --> 00:59:54.350
you could rationalize through the fucking roof.

2331
00:59:54.380 --> 00:59:54.651
Oh,

2332
00:59:54.651 --> 00:59:55.700
it's going to be fine.

2333
00:59:55.730 --> 00:59:56.240
Every,

2334
00:59:56.240 --> 00:59:58.760
every dark crowd has a chauffeur lining.

2335
00:59:59.080 --> 00:59:59.450
Listen,

2336
00:59:59.450 --> 01:00:00.650
you've got to get through the hard times.

2337
01:00:00.651 --> 01:00:03.050
You got to the good time to rationalize all you want,

2338
01:00:03.051 --> 01:00:06.200
but you're going to howl like a baby when that girl leaves you

2339
01:00:08.660 --> 01:00:13.310
swinging that I can get you set up toxoplasmosis that,

2340
01:00:14.210 --> 01:00:15.080
but you know what the thing is?

2341
01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:15.771
I would cry,

2342
01:00:15.771 --> 01:00:16.430
but you know what?

2343
01:00:16.430 --> 01:00:19.500
I lived long enough to know that it passes.

2344
01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:19.850
Yes,

2345
01:00:19.850 --> 01:00:20.660
it does pass,

2346
01:00:20.660 --> 01:00:21.740
but you've got to experience it,

2347
01:00:21.741 --> 01:00:21.921
man.

2348
01:00:21.921 --> 01:00:25.430
You can tell people that all you want and I and I will experience so I don't

2349
01:00:25.431 --> 01:00:26.211
shoot away either.

2350
01:00:26.211 --> 01:00:26.541
It's like,

2351
01:00:26.541 --> 01:00:26.900
you know,

2352
01:00:26.900 --> 01:00:27.560
even now,

2353
01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:28.430
32 Joe Rogan,

2354
01:00:28.431 --> 01:00:29.270
I'll cry if I couldn't move.

2355
01:00:29.271 --> 01:00:30.680
It comes down to the guy and I should cry.

2356
01:00:30.740 --> 01:00:32.820
I might cry a little girl's movies there.

2357
01:00:32.850 --> 01:00:33.890
I believe that.

2358
01:00:34.130 --> 01:00:34.511
You know what I mean?

2359
01:00:34.511 --> 01:00:35.344
Tangled.

2360
01:00:35.350 --> 01:00:37.400
I was watching good will hunting the other than that,

2361
01:00:37.401 --> 01:00:38.234
it's not your fault.

2362
01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:40.770
You have a tangle isn't even real people.

2363
01:00:40.850 --> 01:00:41.880
You guys are too big.

2364
01:00:41.890 --> 01:00:42.810
They animated pay.

2365
01:00:42.930 --> 01:00:43.763
Hey

2366
01:00:45.380 --> 01:00:46.190
<v 2>cry a little bit,</v>

2367
01:00:46.190 --> 01:00:47.170
which was the spectacle.

2368
01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:48.433
Pixar movies.

2369
01:00:48.450 --> 01:00:48.710
Uh,

2370
01:00:48.710 --> 01:00:49.380
Steve Carell.

2371
01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:50.510
I wasn't a Pixar movie.

2372
01:00:51.290 --> 01:00:54.920
I just think they all are there and there's all those little yellow guys

2373
01:00:54.921 --> 01:00:55.360
everywhere.

2374
01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:58.480
<v 0>I didn't know how to deal with that one is what we,</v>

2375
01:00:58.540 --> 01:00:59.710
what we've seen before that though.

2376
01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:00.460
<v 2>Um,</v>

2377
01:01:00.460 --> 01:01:01.360
I think we were talking about,

2378
01:01:02.710 --> 01:01:02.790
oh,

2379
01:01:02.790 --> 01:01:03.670
it's not my girlfriend.

2380
01:01:03.671 --> 01:01:05.020
I was using her as a poor example,

2381
01:01:05.021 --> 01:01:07.420
but it doesn't hurt to tell you how big of a Dick I become.

2382
01:01:07.750 --> 01:01:08.740
And she doesn't do it often,

2383
01:01:08.741 --> 01:01:11.650
but it's like I become very intolerant of people who it's like you have the

2384
01:01:11.651 --> 01:01:12.100
intellect,

2385
01:01:12.100 --> 01:01:13.180
you're capable of doing it,

2386
01:01:13.660 --> 01:01:14.493
figure it out.

2387
01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:16.990
Every answer you need to know is in that computer right there.

2388
01:01:16.991 --> 01:01:18.310
Every fucking answer.

2389
01:01:18.430 --> 01:01:19.780
You need to know anything.

2390
01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:20.301
It's like,

2391
01:01:20.301 --> 01:01:20.530
like,

2392
01:01:20.530 --> 01:01:20.800
like,

2393
01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:21.010
uh,

2394
01:01:21.010 --> 01:01:21.821
some friends will ask me,

2395
01:01:21.821 --> 01:01:22.031
it's like,

2396
01:01:22.031 --> 01:01:22.660
hey,

2397
01:01:22.660 --> 01:01:23.890
I can't look my playstation up.

2398
01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:24.641
There's a tutorial,

2399
01:01:24.641 --> 01:01:25.870
some 12 year old kid on youtube.

2400
01:01:25.871 --> 01:01:27.130
We'll show you how to fucking do it.

2401
01:01:27.330 --> 01:01:27.730
Everything.

2402
01:01:27.730 --> 01:01:27.890
Yeah,

2403
01:01:27.890 --> 01:01:28.940
<v 0>you didn't know is out there.</v>

2404
01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:31.640
If you haven't some shitty times in your life,

2405
01:01:31.790 --> 01:01:33.770
the best thing to have his good friends.

2406
01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:38.210
There's nothing that's even close to it when you're in a shit mood and some you

2407
01:01:38.211 --> 01:01:38.510
just,

2408
01:01:38.510 --> 01:01:39.440
you just feel like,

2409
01:01:39.441 --> 01:01:40.490
God damn man,

2410
01:01:40.491 --> 01:01:42.950
my life is just not where I want it to be.

2411
01:01:42.951 --> 01:01:44.500
And you go and hang out with like Chili

2412
01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:48.210
<v 2>and Eddie Bravo at Ari and we all get high and go and eat</v>

2413
01:01:48.310 --> 01:01:49.180
<v 0>together or something like that.</v>

2414
01:01:49.330 --> 01:01:53.230
You'll be laughing so much by the end of that you'll feel so like if you have

2415
01:01:53.231 --> 01:01:54.064
good friends,

2416
01:01:54.190 --> 01:01:56.080
good friends can get you through any fucking creepy,

2417
01:01:56.081 --> 01:01:56.914
weird shit.

2418
01:01:56.950 --> 01:01:59.740
And there's a lot of people out there that don't have good friends.

2419
01:01:59.950 --> 01:02:03.550
There's a lot of people out there that really have never sort of fostered any

2420
01:02:03.551 --> 01:02:05.590
like really deep connection with people.

2421
01:02:05.710 --> 01:02:08.740
Really honest connection with people for years and years and years and years to

2422
01:02:08.741 --> 01:02:09.491
the point where you're really,

2423
01:02:09.491 --> 01:02:09.821
really,

2424
01:02:09.821 --> 01:02:10.654
really know each other.

2425
01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:13.530
<v 2>It's suspicious to me and dude say who comes from his hometown?</v>

2426
01:02:13.531 --> 01:02:15.740
It doesn't have any buddies back home or you know,

2427
01:02:15.780 --> 01:02:16.471
something like that.

2428
01:02:16.471 --> 01:02:18.230
Somebody who can't vouch for his character,

2429
01:02:18.270 --> 01:02:18.541
you know,

2430
01:02:18.541 --> 01:02:19.510
from way it's like,

2431
01:02:19.570 --> 01:02:20.310
are you

2432
01:02:20.310 --> 01:02:20.620
<v 0>speak?</v>

2433
01:02:20.620 --> 01:02:21.980
Tell me a few.

2434
01:02:22.260 --> 01:02:23.250
I have a few friends.

2435
01:02:23.251 --> 01:02:27.680
I have like a four or five friends from back home still I have to retouch with.

2436
01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:28.130
Yeah,

2437
01:02:28.130 --> 01:02:28.860
but that's it.

2438
01:02:28.860 --> 01:02:29.130
There's a,

2439
01:02:29.130 --> 01:02:30.300
there was a bunch that I couldn't,

2440
01:02:30.330 --> 01:02:31.410
after a certain point in time,

2441
01:02:31.510 --> 01:02:32.261
<v 2>it whittles down.</v>

2442
01:02:32.261 --> 01:02:32.591
It's like,

2443
01:02:32.591 --> 01:02:33.550
you know some of your friends,

2444
01:02:33.551 --> 01:02:34.001
it's like you're,

2445
01:02:34.001 --> 01:02:34.834
you're out with him and said,

2446
01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:35.501
you got my back.

2447
01:02:35.501 --> 01:02:37.660
If shit jumps off going to a wedding bro,

2448
01:02:37.661 --> 01:02:38.500
what the fuck is going to check?

2449
01:02:38.530 --> 01:02:39.281
What is wrong with you?

2450
01:02:39.281 --> 01:02:39.731
Or 30.

2451
01:02:39.731 --> 01:02:40.640
So I went out with

2452
01:02:40.970 --> 01:02:42.410
<v 0>my two buddies,</v>

2453
01:02:42.610 --> 01:02:43.100
um,

2454
01:02:43.100 --> 01:02:44.630
Jimmy did Teleo and Jimmy lawless,

2455
01:02:44.631 --> 01:02:47.090
two good friends of mine from back when my high school days,

2456
01:02:47.870 --> 01:02:48.141
you know,

2457
01:02:48.141 --> 01:02:52.190
there's are my two closest friends back then and I'm still very,

2458
01:02:52.191 --> 01:02:52.491
you know,

2459
01:02:52.491 --> 01:02:56.570
always in contact with them and Jimmy Lawless as a moderator on my message

2460
01:02:56.571 --> 01:02:57.200
board.

2461
01:02:57.200 --> 01:02:57.710
Oh Wow.

2462
01:02:57.710 --> 01:02:57.911
Yeah,

2463
01:02:57.911 --> 01:02:58.140
he's,

2464
01:02:58.140 --> 01:02:58.970
he's a great guy.

2465
01:02:58.970 --> 01:03:02.510
And we all went out to dinner last time that UFC was in town.

2466
01:03:02.511 --> 01:03:05.150
I got them tickets for the UFC and then we all went out to dinner and we had

2467
01:03:05.151 --> 01:03:06.560
some Chinese food when we're eating,

2468
01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:08.810
we're sitting around with Jimmy's kids.

2469
01:03:08.890 --> 01:03:09.621
Wasn't Jimmy's kid?

2470
01:03:09.621 --> 01:03:09.921
It was a,

2471
01:03:09.921 --> 01:03:10.100
yeah,

2472
01:03:10.100 --> 01:03:10.711
Jimmy lawless,

2473
01:03:10.711 --> 01:03:11.241
his kid,

2474
01:03:11.241 --> 01:03:12.320
his son was there,

2475
01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:13.221
his cousin was there,

2476
01:03:13.221 --> 01:03:14.510
and we're all sitting around together.

2477
01:03:14.511 --> 01:03:15.261
We're likely look at us,

2478
01:03:15.261 --> 01:03:16.430
we're like fucking grownups.

2479
01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:18.710
Now how bizarre is is you have kids,

2480
01:03:18.730 --> 01:03:19.640
your here's your kid,

2481
01:03:19.641 --> 01:03:20.000
your kids,

2482
01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.830
like a polite young teenager.

2483
01:03:22.630 --> 01:03:24.250
<v 2>But when you say separately from your friends,</v>

2484
01:03:24.251 --> 01:03:25.390
you all evolved together.

2485
01:03:26.110 --> 01:03:26.770
What do you mean?

2486
01:03:26.770 --> 01:03:28.030
Are these the kinds of friends like I,

2487
01:03:28.031 --> 01:03:28.301
you know,

2488
01:03:28.301 --> 01:03:29.530
I've got friends back home that,

2489
01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:29.710
you know,

2490
01:03:29.710 --> 01:03:32.970
we shared an experience as children but it my life and obviously yours

2491
01:03:32.980 --> 01:03:35.230
especially so much different than it used to be.

2492
01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:36.011
You know what I mean?

2493
01:03:36.011 --> 01:03:38.290
Like a lot of them look at you like you live on the moon or something.

2494
01:03:38.710 --> 01:03:39.221
They don't.

2495
01:03:39.221 --> 01:03:42.700
They know me pretty well and we hanging out and I guess what I'm saying is like

2496
01:03:42.701 --> 01:03:43.271
there's guys,

2497
01:03:43.271 --> 01:03:46.480
it's like I moved away and some of them just went a different way and have

2498
01:03:46.481 --> 01:03:47.560
different set of beliefs.

2499
01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:48.760
Totally understandable.

2500
01:03:48.761 --> 01:03:49.211
But there's some,

2501
01:03:49.211 --> 01:03:50.310
even though we grew up apart,

2502
01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:51.280
evolve together,

2503
01:03:51.580 --> 01:03:51.911
like you know,

2504
01:03:51.911 --> 01:03:55.180
I have a buddy Scotty Gee who took me to hit the ditch one time in high school,

2505
01:03:55.660 --> 01:03:57.580
like my junior year in highs or,

2506
01:03:57.640 --> 01:03:57.851
yeah,

2507
01:03:57.851 --> 01:03:58.511
my junior year,

2508
01:03:58.511 --> 01:03:59.960
his senior year I was,

2509
01:03:59.980 --> 01:04:00.200
you know,

2510
01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:00.880
I was a jock.

2511
01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:02.560
I was into lifting weights and kicking ass.

2512
01:04:02.561 --> 01:04:03.161
At least that was,

2513
01:04:03.161 --> 01:04:03.370
you know,

2514
01:04:03.370 --> 01:04:04.630
what I wanted to be about.

2515
01:04:04.810 --> 01:04:08.050
But there was part of me that just was so curious about what these dudes are,

2516
01:04:08.051 --> 01:04:08.291
you know,

2517
01:04:08.291 --> 01:04:09.610
with the weed getting high.

2518
01:04:09.611 --> 01:04:11.980
And Scotty g one time pulls up in his orange bug.

2519
01:04:11.981 --> 01:04:12.191
He's like,

2520
01:04:12.191 --> 01:04:12.311
hey,

2521
01:04:12.311 --> 01:04:13.480
let's ditch and go play pool.

2522
01:04:13.990 --> 01:04:14.410
I was like,

2523
01:04:14.410 --> 01:04:15.243
all right.

2524
01:04:15.310 --> 01:04:16.270
That changed my life.

2525
01:04:16.300 --> 01:04:19.300
It made me pretty much half of who I am today that day.

2526
01:04:19.330 --> 01:04:20.500
Who wasn't a ditch school.

2527
01:04:20.501 --> 01:04:21.880
One day I did school with Scotty.

2528
01:04:21.881 --> 01:04:22.121
Gee,

2529
01:04:22.121 --> 01:04:22.954
it's because he,

2530
01:04:23.020 --> 01:04:28.020
he turned me on that day to cool dope and to seventies rock and roll music all

2531
01:04:28.121 --> 01:04:28.820
in one day.

2532
01:04:28.820 --> 01:04:32.230
One day Gloria say me and that guy talk like all the time,

2533
01:04:32.231 --> 01:04:34.060
like we lost Tux but we got back in touch.

2534
01:04:34.061 --> 01:04:36.490
But we talk all the time because even though it was years apart,

2535
01:04:36.491 --> 01:04:37.390
we evolve together.

2536
01:04:37.450 --> 01:04:38.470
What songs we're playing

2537
01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.740
the joker I got into Steve Miller,

2538
01:04:41.950 --> 01:04:42.491
you know what I mean?

2539
01:04:42.491 --> 01:04:42.821
Like that.

2540
01:04:42.821 --> 01:04:46.390
The basic pool hall teeth Miller is the most famous guy that no one can

2541
01:04:46.391 --> 01:04:47.224
recognize.

2542
01:04:47.590 --> 01:04:47.950
Oh yeah,

2543
01:04:47.950 --> 01:04:48.290
like see,

2544
01:04:48.290 --> 01:04:50.250
like I have no idea who the fuck Steve Miller wouldn't be.

2545
01:04:50.490 --> 01:04:51.490
That's not lady Gaga.

2546
01:04:51.730 --> 01:04:53.020
He could be at the grocery store.

2547
01:04:53.021 --> 01:04:53.831
You'd have no idea.

2548
01:04:53.831 --> 01:04:57.040
You're standing next to the guy that sang a million grand.

2549
01:04:57.041 --> 01:04:58.180
Fucking probably say his name.

2550
01:04:58.181 --> 01:04:58.751
And I still would be like,

2551
01:04:58.751 --> 01:04:59.180
all right,

2552
01:04:59.180 --> 01:04:59.531
generic.

2553
01:04:59.531 --> 01:05:04.010
Now some people call me to space cowboy Tom.

2554
01:05:04.830 --> 01:05:05.750
Me The joke.

2555
01:05:06.580 --> 01:05:06.940
Yeah,

2556
01:05:06.940 --> 01:05:08.290
he's a bad motherfucker.

2557
01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:09.610
He had a bunch of jungle love.

2558
01:05:09.611 --> 01:05:10.660
That's a great jam.

2559
01:05:10.661 --> 01:05:13.690
He had a bunch of great fucking songs and nobody knows what he looks like.

2560
01:05:14.940 --> 01:05:15.773
That was him.

2561
01:05:15.790 --> 01:05:16.623
That's ridiculous.

2562
01:05:16.930 --> 01:05:18.310
Looks like that guy works for Microsoft.

2563
01:05:18.310 --> 01:05:18.551
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

2564
01:05:18.551 --> 01:05:19.120
exactly.

2565
01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:20.590
That's one of bombers executives.

2566
01:05:20.730 --> 01:05:21.940
But there's like guys in your life,

2567
01:05:21.941 --> 01:05:24.820
it's like you keep buddies that just kind of turned you onto one thing or two of

2568
01:05:24.821 --> 01:05:25.990
you on another and it's like he's,

2569
01:05:25.991 --> 01:05:28.780
he was one of those guys and I would have other buddies that you just get along

2570
01:05:28.781 --> 01:05:28.931
with,

2571
01:05:28.931 --> 01:05:29.230
but,

2572
01:05:29.230 --> 01:05:29.381
well,

2573
01:05:29.381 --> 01:05:30.071
my tunes part,

2574
01:05:30.071 --> 01:05:32.080
there's some can be real weird.

2575
01:05:32.170 --> 01:05:32.951
My two buddies,

2576
01:05:32.951 --> 01:05:33.521
a Jimmy,

2577
01:05:33.521 --> 01:05:34.060
Jimmy,

2578
01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:34.720
Jimmy Tutelian,

2579
01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:35.321
Jimmy lost.

2580
01:05:35.321 --> 01:05:37.810
One of the things that I learned from those guys when I was in high school.

2581
01:05:38.020 --> 01:05:38.740
They're both uh,

2582
01:05:38.740 --> 01:05:39.990
Jimmy to Taleo.

2583
01:05:40.010 --> 01:05:40.151
Yeah,

2584
01:05:40.151 --> 01:05:41.140
they're both a year older than me.

2585
01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:43.720
One of the things I learned from both of them was work ethic.

2586
01:05:43.780 --> 01:05:45.430
These guys Bolt Boston,

2587
01:05:45.431 --> 01:05:46.180
their ass,

2588
01:05:46.180 --> 01:05:46.391
you know,

2589
01:05:46.391 --> 01:05:50.820
there's that east coast work ethic that one of them is Jimmy's a Jimmy Detillie

2590
01:05:50.830 --> 01:05:53.770
was an electrician and he had his own company like right at high school.

2591
01:05:54.540 --> 01:05:57.370
I started working for works for an electrician for like a year and then branched

2592
01:05:57.371 --> 01:05:57.560
out,

2593
01:05:57.560 --> 01:05:58.391
got his own business,

2594
01:05:58.391 --> 01:06:00.960
had people working for and had fans and shit all over time.

2595
01:06:01.230 --> 01:06:03.760
He was always working hard,

2596
01:06:03.770 --> 01:06:04.930
never complaints.

2597
01:06:05.020 --> 01:06:06.910
He helped me deliver newspapers.

2598
01:06:06.911 --> 01:06:07.300
Man.

2599
01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:11.110
When my fucking car broke down Boston Globe on a Sunday,

2600
01:06:11.111 --> 01:06:11.471
dude,

2601
01:06:11.471 --> 01:06:15.520
it was like fucking had a pick him up at like three o'clock in the morning.

2602
01:06:15.521 --> 01:06:15.751
I thought,

2603
01:06:15.751 --> 01:06:16.180
I didn't think,

2604
01:06:16.180 --> 01:06:17.500
I think we stayed up all night.

2605
01:06:17.501 --> 01:06:18.041
I think what it is,

2606
01:06:18.041 --> 01:06:18.850
we went out,

2607
01:06:18.850 --> 01:06:19.720
we went out drinking,

2608
01:06:19.721 --> 01:06:24.721
went out to a club and then he came with me and we fucking drove around and toss

2609
01:06:24.911 --> 01:06:26.110
newspaper like at four in the morning.

2610
01:06:26.111 --> 01:06:27.100
That's when they're hot off the press,

2611
01:06:27.101 --> 01:06:27.301
right?

2612
01:06:27.301 --> 01:06:27.640
Like yeah,

2613
01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:30.010
we're going to do it from four in the morning till like nine and it was like,

2614
01:06:30.011 --> 01:06:31.690
I can't believe you'd do this every week.

2615
01:06:31.690 --> 01:06:32.530
You fucking idiot.

2616
01:06:32.890 --> 01:06:35.740
He was laughing but he's still was down to do it.

2617
01:06:36.100 --> 01:06:36.680
Does that,

2618
01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:37.990
that east coast work.

2619
01:06:37.991 --> 01:06:38.291
I was like,

2620
01:06:38.291 --> 01:06:38.500
man,

2621
01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:41.650
he's a guy who was already working 50 fucking 60 hours a ride and his own

2622
01:06:41.651 --> 01:06:42.450
business.

2623
01:06:42.450 --> 01:06:44.200
It can help instill things in use sometimes too.

2624
01:06:44.201 --> 01:06:44.501
It's like,

2625
01:06:44.501 --> 01:06:44.771
okay,

2626
01:06:44.771 --> 01:06:45.604
cool.

2627
01:06:45.610 --> 01:06:46.660
I was a lazy cunt,

2628
01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:47.171
you know,

2629
01:06:47.171 --> 01:06:49.600
and I was not lazy and working out.

2630
01:06:49.630 --> 01:06:50.230
Those are the only thing.

2631
01:06:50.230 --> 01:06:51.063
I was not lazy,

2632
01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:51.911
not lazy,

2633
01:06:51.911 --> 01:06:54.880
and going to Taco window class and you get it in my work and sparring and

2634
01:06:54.881 --> 01:06:55.211
training,

2635
01:06:55.211 --> 01:06:55.620
all that.

2636
01:06:55.620 --> 01:06:57.550
There was the only thing my whole life I wasn't lazy at.

2637
01:06:57.760 --> 01:06:59.890
But then I went when I would do something that I didn't want to do,

2638
01:06:59.891 --> 01:07:00.641
like a job,

2639
01:07:00.641 --> 01:07:00.970
I was like,

2640
01:07:00.970 --> 01:07:02.080
oh fuck all this.

2641
01:07:02.650 --> 01:07:04.030
And for both of those guys,

2642
01:07:04.031 --> 01:07:06.820
I realized how hard some people work.

2643
01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:10.990
Like Jimmy Lawless went on to be a successful contractor and he got me a job

2644
01:07:10.991 --> 01:07:12.640
working one summer with his,

2645
01:07:12.641 --> 01:07:13.060
uh,

2646
01:07:13.060 --> 01:07:13.893
his boss.

2647
01:07:14.420 --> 01:07:14.930
I didn't worry,

2648
01:07:14.930 --> 01:07:15.820
I didn't last very long.

2649
01:07:15.821 --> 01:07:16.654
I think I lasted,

2650
01:07:16.660 --> 01:07:18.340
I think I did two weeks.

2651
01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:22.990
We were building a wheelchair ramp for a knights of Columbus Hall.

2652
01:07:23.140 --> 01:07:24.410
So for two weeks,

2653
01:07:24.420 --> 01:07:24.840
a wheelchair.

2654
01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:27.940
All I was doing was carrying cement and pressure,

2655
01:07:27.941 --> 01:07:29.620
treated lumber and work,

2656
01:07:29.621 --> 01:07:30.011
dude.

2657
01:07:30.011 --> 01:07:30.880
So my hands,

2658
01:07:30.881 --> 01:07:31.151
you know,

2659
01:07:31.151 --> 01:07:31.481
pressure,

2660
01:07:31.481 --> 01:07:32.081
treated lumber,

2661
01:07:32.081 --> 01:07:33.310
they treat it with chemicals.

2662
01:07:33.580 --> 01:07:37.840
So you get these gnarly ass fucking splinters in your hand and were you working

2663
01:07:37.841 --> 01:07:38.680
as a labor man?

2664
01:07:38.681 --> 01:07:40.000
They're not paying you to buy gloves,

2665
01:07:40.001 --> 01:07:40.241
dude.

2666
01:07:40.241 --> 01:07:40.871
You just show up,

2667
01:07:40.871 --> 01:07:41.470
bitch.

2668
01:07:41.470 --> 01:07:42.251
You don't get a glove.

2669
01:07:42.251 --> 01:07:43.780
Just pick it up with your fucking hand.

2670
01:07:44.650 --> 01:07:45.490
That east coast,

2671
01:07:45.491 --> 01:07:45.790
you know,

2672
01:07:45.790 --> 01:07:46.361
Boston,

2673
01:07:46.361 --> 01:07:47.410
it's fucking freezing out.

2674
01:07:47.411 --> 01:07:49.150
Pick that fucking thing up the Hammock,

2675
01:07:49.151 --> 01:07:50.460
the bank show up,

2676
01:07:51.010 --> 01:07:51.371
show up,

2677
01:07:51.371 --> 01:07:52.204
you do your work.

2678
01:07:52.280 --> 01:07:53.050
Don't complain.

2679
01:07:53.050 --> 01:07:53.331
Yeah.

2680
01:07:53.331 --> 01:07:53.711
And so,

2681
01:07:53.711 --> 01:07:54.011
you know,

2682
01:07:54.011 --> 01:07:55.090
I lasted two weeks,

2683
01:07:55.091 --> 01:07:55.271
man.

2684
01:07:55.271 --> 01:07:57.970
We were carrying bags of cement all day when he was,

2685
01:07:58.230 --> 01:08:02.230
he was actually like a carpenter's apprentice and he wasn't doing as much grunt

2686
01:08:02.231 --> 01:08:02.530
work.

2687
01:08:02.530 --> 01:08:02.790
Right?

2688
01:08:02.790 --> 01:08:03.623
But everybody,

2689
01:08:03.700 --> 01:08:05.440
if you want to become a carpenter,

2690
01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:06.221
you have to,

2691
01:08:06.221 --> 01:08:06.491
you know,

2692
01:08:06.491 --> 01:08:07.810
you've got to become an apprentice.

2693
01:08:07.811 --> 01:08:08.441
You gotta work hard,

2694
01:08:08.441 --> 01:08:11.110
you gotta learn every single aspect of the fucking business.

2695
01:08:12.610 --> 01:08:14.880
He realized how much hard work is involved and what does he,

2696
01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:15.710
he's huge now.

2697
01:08:15.710 --> 01:08:16.140
Like anyone

2698
01:08:16.140 --> 01:08:16.361
<v 1>that said,</v>

2699
01:08:16.361 --> 01:08:16.580
you know,

2700
01:08:16.580 --> 01:08:19.130
he does really well and you just got to know his own construction company.

2701
01:08:19.131 --> 01:08:21.840
And I thought everybody got hit by the economy,

2702
01:08:22.010 --> 01:08:24.410
especially in that business because that business is,

2703
01:08:24.411 --> 01:08:24.651
you know,

2704
01:08:24.651 --> 01:08:27.770
people doing renovations and doing things they didn't want and that's not

2705
01:08:27.771 --> 01:08:28.970
necessarily need,

2706
01:08:29.180 --> 01:08:31.490
but they might want their elective thing.

2707
01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:32.780
Let's build a new house,

2708
01:08:32.781 --> 01:08:33.040
let's,

2709
01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:33.271
you know,

2710
01:08:33.271 --> 01:08:36.560
and so those businesses get hit hard when it comes to,

2711
01:08:36.561 --> 01:08:36.860
uh,

2712
01:08:36.860 --> 01:08:37.131
you know,

2713
01:08:37.131 --> 01:08:38.450
when the economy gets Shitty,

2714
01:08:38.630 --> 01:08:39.830
which I don't understand at all.

2715
01:08:39.900 --> 01:08:40.260
Yeah.

2716
01:08:40.260 --> 01:08:40.431
Yeah.

2717
01:08:40.431 --> 01:08:42.080
It's funny cause my buddy a Scottish,

2718
01:08:42.081 --> 01:08:43.170
you ended up owning us.

2719
01:08:43.230 --> 01:08:45.860
He owns a carpet cleaning business and he builds it up like,

2720
01:08:45.890 --> 01:08:47.990
but he showed me that you could be a pothead and driven.

2721
01:08:48.290 --> 01:08:49.220
That's what it was.

2722
01:08:49.460 --> 01:08:52.040
It was like he smokes dope on the constant like I do.

2723
01:08:52.041 --> 01:08:55.040
But like the guy owned a super successful carpet business to the point where you

2724
01:08:55.041 --> 01:08:55.730
had to have somebody,

2725
01:08:55.730 --> 01:08:57.770
he cleans ice tea and Coco's carpet.

2726
01:08:58.070 --> 01:08:59.090
That's hilarious.

2727
01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:01.010
They got a spot out in Chandler,

2728
01:09:01.011 --> 01:09:02.390
Arizona or something like that.

2729
01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:03.021
But it's like,

2730
01:09:03.021 --> 01:09:05.450
it's one of those thing coco to hangs around in the house where her ass hanging

2731
01:09:05.451 --> 01:09:06.350
out apparently.

2732
01:09:06.351 --> 01:09:08.660
So she does all the time.

2733
01:09:08.690 --> 01:09:09.523
Oh.

2734
01:09:09.870 --> 01:09:10.820
And he just,

2735
01:09:10.950 --> 01:09:14.270
well her minions who can clean it for them,

2736
01:09:14.271 --> 01:09:15.770
but I think he takes that job himself.

2737
01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:16.730
Jesus Christ,

2738
01:09:16.731 --> 01:09:17.564
man.

2739
01:09:17.810 --> 01:09:18.590
Wow.

2740
01:09:18.590 --> 01:09:19.311
That's a big ass.

2741
01:09:19.311 --> 01:09:20.230
If you're in the big assets,

2742
01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:21.420
that's the ass big thing.

2743
01:09:21.580 --> 01:09:22.021
I'm a chick.

2744
01:09:22.021 --> 01:09:22.854
That's a big one.

2745
01:09:23.690 --> 01:09:24.260
No,

2746
01:09:24.260 --> 01:09:25.630
I think it's real big thing.

2747
01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:27.300
It's not really their seating white girl with an asset.

2748
01:09:28.370 --> 01:09:29.061
Something happened.

2749
01:09:29.061 --> 01:09:29.600
Their son,

2750
01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:30.433
they did some,

2751
01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:31.430
they did some work.

2752
01:09:31.940 --> 01:09:32.391
Yo Man,

2753
01:09:32.391 --> 01:09:33.670
it's real cause I see it.

2754
01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:34.460
Joe Rogan.

2755
01:09:34.460 --> 01:09:35.330
Oh the ice tea.

2756
01:09:35.430 --> 01:09:37.400
Impressive returns here man.

2757
01:09:37.610 --> 01:09:39.770
I heard it said some shitty thing about me.

2758
01:09:39.860 --> 01:09:40.520
Really.

2759
01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:43.810
Someone was saying that he was happy to go to the fights because he had a CD and

2760
01:09:43.811 --> 01:09:45.470
the Joe Rogan run his mouth.

2761
01:09:46.010 --> 01:09:47.300
Maybe it was just joking around,

2762
01:09:47.630 --> 01:09:49.520
but me as an old school ice tea fan,

2763
01:09:49.521 --> 01:09:49.821
I was like,

2764
01:09:49.821 --> 01:09:50.360
yeah,

2765
01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:52.010
I used to talk too much.

2766
01:09:52.011 --> 01:09:53.780
Well I run my mouth,

2767
01:09:53.900 --> 01:09:54.411
Yo man,

2768
01:09:54.411 --> 01:09:56.020
I ain't gotta hear show broken.

2769
01:09:56.060 --> 01:10:01.060
Run his mouth talking expert shit saying thin,

2770
01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:02.780
intelligent shit.

2771
01:10:02.860 --> 01:10:04.100
And He'd been watching this show at all.

2772
01:10:04.190 --> 01:10:05.030
No,

2773
01:10:05.130 --> 01:10:05.571
I walked,

2774
01:10:05.571 --> 01:10:05.871
I walked in.

2775
01:10:05.871 --> 01:10:07.280
I cannot have enough room.

2776
01:10:07.310 --> 01:10:10.950
There's not a room on the hard drive for another crazy wacky fucking show.

2777
01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:12.430
I saw when I get addicted to us,

2778
01:10:12.431 --> 01:10:13.221
it's pretty interesting.

2779
01:10:13.221 --> 01:10:14.330
He's got his dog and everything.

2780
01:10:14.331 --> 01:10:19.331
I've put that I got a dope pit bull named felony hit and he plays video games to

2781
01:10:20.021 --> 01:10:20.510
go out there.

2782
01:10:20.510 --> 01:10:21.500
So what you telling me?

2783
01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:22.393
I'd like to,

2784
01:10:22.730 --> 01:10:23.870
I'd like to be buddies with them.

2785
01:10:23.871 --> 01:10:24.704
I hope that works out.

2786
01:10:25.010 --> 01:10:25.761
I would love to tell him,

2787
01:10:25.761 --> 01:10:25.971
look,

2788
01:10:25.971 --> 01:10:26.271
I used to,

2789
01:10:26.271 --> 01:10:26.660
I'm sorry.

2790
01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:28.010
I know you when I do my commentary.

2791
01:10:28.011 --> 01:10:28.650
Can we just hang out?

2792
01:10:28.650 --> 01:10:29.790
Is he following you smoke a joint.

2793
01:10:29.830 --> 01:10:30.910
See she was following him on too.

2794
01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:31.491
Is he following you?

2795
01:10:31.491 --> 01:10:34.730
I don't think he doesn't even like next level or the final level kind of video

2796
01:10:34.731 --> 01:10:35.564
game guys.

2797
01:10:35.710 --> 01:10:38.780
You know the final levels like the baddest boss of the video game,

2798
01:10:38.781 --> 01:10:40.490
but I think he should follow you before you him.

2799
01:10:40.491 --> 01:10:41.940
I think he needs the yield on that ship.

2800
01:10:42.850 --> 01:10:44.030
Jerry's ice tea man.

2801
01:10:44.060 --> 01:10:44.351
Next to you.

2802
01:10:44.351 --> 01:10:46.070
I've seen you should say I am a man.

2803
01:10:46.310 --> 01:10:47.091
I would love to.

2804
01:10:47.091 --> 01:10:47.840
I love the guy.

2805
01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:50.900
I was a huge ice tea fan when I was delivering newspapers.

2806
01:10:50.901 --> 01:10:52.310
I used to listen to fucking colors,

2807
01:10:52.311 --> 01:10:52.700
colors,

2808
01:10:52.700 --> 01:10:53.091
colors,

2809
01:10:53.091 --> 01:10:53.840
colors,

2810
01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:56.000
colors for real.

2811
01:10:56.001 --> 01:10:57.110
I listened to a lot of ice tea.

2812
01:10:57.111 --> 01:10:58.820
Don't show me regional gangster,

2813
01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:00.130
get butt naked in fun.

2814
01:11:00.740 --> 01:11:03.170
I used to have all those on cassette son.

2815
01:11:03.410 --> 01:11:05.450
I'd be driving around in my fucking,

2816
01:11:05.451 --> 01:11:08.930
I had a a Gmc van that I bought for 500 bucks,

2817
01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:10.360
Brown with no windows.

2818
01:11:10.370 --> 01:11:11.450
What was cargo vans?

2819
01:11:11.690 --> 01:11:12.710
And I drove my,

2820
01:11:12.711 --> 01:11:13.050
uh,

2821
01:11:13.050 --> 01:11:16.140
I've drove that around and deliver newspapers when I was listening to ice tea

2822
01:11:16.330 --> 01:11:17.450
called us comments,

2823
01:11:17.530 --> 01:11:21.090
syndicate and what was the biohazard years too?

2824
01:11:21.100 --> 01:11:21.320
Yeah,

2825
01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:21.411
I,

2826
01:11:21.411 --> 01:11:21.661
you know,

2827
01:11:21.661 --> 01:11:23.790
it's weird to be around the bases now.

2828
01:11:23.820 --> 01:11:25.110
He's amazingly relevant.

2829
01:11:25.111 --> 01:11:26.610
Isn't that amazing how irrelevant.

2830
01:11:26.611 --> 01:11:27.880
He's remained my,

2831
01:11:27.900 --> 01:11:30.930
his best work and my opinion is in pimps up hoes down.

2832
01:11:31.630 --> 01:11:32.910
Tell everybody that he's a pimp.

2833
01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:35.010
You know that he might go back into the pimp game,

2834
01:11:35.060 --> 01:11:35.181
right?

2835
01:11:35.181 --> 01:11:38.430
It's like I didn't know if he was bullshitting or if he was hustling or,

2836
01:11:38.610 --> 01:11:39.270
but I'm like,

2837
01:11:39.270 --> 01:11:39.650
if you,

2838
01:11:39.650 --> 01:11:41.070
if you talk to ice tea,

2839
01:11:41.071 --> 01:11:43.230
iced tea is always talking about and he's a hustler.

2840
01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:47.790
So whether or not he ever did any pimping at all is irrelevant.

2841
01:11:47.940 --> 01:11:51.570
What's relevant and he talks so much about his pimping that he wind up in a pimp

2842
01:11:51.571 --> 01:11:52.350
movie.

2843
01:11:52.350 --> 01:11:53.790
That's what pimping is all about.

2844
01:11:53.820 --> 01:11:54.960
His pimp hand is strong.

2845
01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:55.241
Yeah.

2846
01:11:55.241 --> 01:11:55.711
It was like,

2847
01:11:55.711 --> 01:11:57.330
the thing is it's like he gives lectures,

2848
01:11:57.331 --> 01:11:58.590
like if you've seen his show,

2849
01:11:58.591 --> 01:11:59.490
he goes to college.

2850
01:11:59.491 --> 01:12:01.560
It's like like Ivy League schools and gives lectures.

2851
01:12:01.770 --> 01:12:02.011
I'm like,

2852
01:12:02.011 --> 01:12:03.370
that's pretty bad ass and why?

2853
01:12:03.371 --> 01:12:03.990
What does he get lunch?

2854
01:12:03.990 --> 01:12:04.771
Just on whatever.

2855
01:12:04.771 --> 01:12:05.281
I'm like,

2856
01:12:05.281 --> 01:12:06.114
oh man.

2857
01:12:07.260 --> 01:12:08.093
I would listen.

2858
01:12:08.100 --> 01:12:11.190
I would love to get iced tea on the pocket when life gives you lemons to tell it

2859
01:12:11.191 --> 01:12:12.420
to suck your Dick.

2860
01:12:12.421 --> 01:12:14.940
Joe Rogan is the only thing that I thought it was pretty ridiculous though.

2861
01:12:14.941 --> 01:12:17.250
It's when he got mad at Soulja boy for ruling and hip hop.

2862
01:12:17.940 --> 01:12:18.721
Did you hear that soldier?

2863
01:12:18.721 --> 01:12:18.890
Boy,

2864
01:12:18.890 --> 01:12:21.830
he's going to bite I Chet hotmail five minute by minute.

2865
01:12:21.831 --> 01:12:22.664
Is that true?

2866
01:12:22.980 --> 01:12:24.060
Probably have that much money.

2867
01:12:24.540 --> 01:12:26.160
When fear factor gets back on it.

2868
01:12:26.161 --> 01:12:26.970
Let's get a jet.

2869
01:12:26.970 --> 01:12:27.271
I say,

2870
01:12:27.271 --> 01:12:28.740
let's see hammers.

2871
01:12:28.741 --> 01:12:29.130
Shit.

2872
01:12:29.130 --> 01:12:29.963
No,

2873
01:12:30.300 --> 01:12:31.330
I don't think I ever want to chat.

2874
01:12:31.350 --> 01:12:32.090
Let's get hell on it.

2875
01:12:32.090 --> 01:12:34.290
I'm going to wait for the next thing after the jet.

2876
01:12:34.340 --> 01:12:35.060
Yeah.

2877
01:12:35.060 --> 01:12:37.500
I feel like as soon as the large Hadron collider kicks in,

2878
01:12:37.501 --> 01:12:38.334
we learned some shit.

2879
01:12:38.580 --> 01:12:42.340
There'll be some things better than industrial jet packs are available and earth

2880
01:12:42.470 --> 01:12:42.871
personal.

2881
01:12:42.871 --> 01:12:43.760
I want to find saucer.

2882
01:12:43.761 --> 01:12:44.594
It's what I'm saying.

2883
01:12:44.730 --> 01:12:47.420
I made out of some titanium type shit.

2884
01:12:47.421 --> 01:12:50.390
It doesn't break some gravitational.

2885
01:12:50.580 --> 01:12:52.800
You know when a solar backup Holla at your boy.

2886
01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:56.490
Then I'll fly through the sky dubs on that shit and then I'll fly through the

2887
01:12:56.491 --> 01:12:56.940
sky.

2888
01:12:56.940 --> 01:12:58.740
I don't want to be driving around in a model t.

2889
01:12:58.830 --> 01:12:59.490
You know what I'm saying?

2890
01:12:59.490 --> 01:13:00.150
That's stupid.

2891
01:13:00.150 --> 01:13:02.220
I'll wait for the cars to become good to drive.

2892
01:13:02.460 --> 01:13:04.500
I want to get myself a mosquito helicopter.

2893
01:13:04.501 --> 01:13:05.334
A little person.

2894
01:13:05.740 --> 01:13:07.150
I need a little helicopter,

2895
01:13:07.151 --> 01:13:07.741
a one seat,

2896
01:13:07.741 --> 01:13:12.000
or they sell them since the 70s tiny type of mosquito helicopter.

2897
01:13:12.210 --> 01:13:14.190
It looks like a tiny Apache war helicopter.

2898
01:13:14.191 --> 01:13:15.060
The fucking dope.

2899
01:13:15.270 --> 01:13:15.660
How?

2900
01:13:15.660 --> 01:13:16.890
It's like a model helicopter.

2901
01:13:16.891 --> 01:13:17.724
You can fly.

2902
01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:19.440
You can make one for like a hundred grand.

2903
01:13:19.441 --> 01:13:19.891
Do you remember?

2904
01:13:19.891 --> 01:13:23.070
Do you remember those army jeeps you could buy and you could put it together?

2905
01:13:23.510 --> 01:13:26.040
Like I remember like before I had got my first car,

2906
01:13:26.070 --> 01:13:28.330
I was thinking about buying one of those and just like,

2907
01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:28.591
Yo,

2908
01:13:28.591 --> 01:13:29.570
this is crazy.

2909
01:13:29.580 --> 01:13:30.850
Just mosquito helicopters.

2910
01:13:30.870 --> 01:13:31.860
Tiny man.

2911
01:13:31.970 --> 01:13:33.300
What's the dude flight around man?

2912
01:13:33.301 --> 01:13:34.051
They're fucking dope.

2913
01:13:34.051 --> 01:13:34.884
I need to be one.

2914
01:13:35.070 --> 01:13:35.940
Wow.

2915
01:13:35.970 --> 01:13:36.721
How much these costs?

2916
01:13:36.721 --> 01:13:37.620
$100,000.

2917
01:13:37.650 --> 01:13:39.120
This is pretty bad price,

2918
01:13:39.121 --> 01:13:40.230
I think up to a quarter mill.

2919
01:13:40.231 --> 01:13:41.280
But I'm talking about like,

2920
01:13:41.281 --> 01:13:42.114
think about that.

2921
01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:43.580
We could get that you could get to the car,

2922
01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:45.720
you know you can land on the roof of a clot from home.

2923
01:13:45.810 --> 01:13:49.110
How good must it feel to fly one of those things high as fuck.

2924
01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:49.350
Yeah,

2925
01:13:49.350 --> 01:13:49.800
Dude.

2926
01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:50.633
Let's be honest.

2927
01:13:50.700 --> 01:13:52.260
It'd be the shit and those are the baddest man.

2928
01:13:52.261 --> 01:13:55.290
You don't want to crash when your highest fucking ruined the cause crushed

2929
01:13:55.370 --> 01:13:56.280
because it was hot as fuck.

2930
01:13:56.700 --> 01:13:58.590
You got to really know what you're doing before you do that.

2931
01:13:58.650 --> 01:14:01.710
It's like I wouldn't ever recommend someone to just started smoking weed to

2932
01:14:01.711 --> 01:14:02.610
drive when you're hot.

2933
01:14:02.650 --> 01:14:03.000
All right,

2934
01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:06.390
you've got gotta be a Goddamn Jed eye night on the weed to just think about

2935
01:14:06.391 --> 01:14:08.010
getting in your car and not worrying about it.

2936
01:14:08.270 --> 01:14:10.680
I wouldn't have to go all negotiate some crazy maneuvers,

2937
01:14:10.681 --> 01:14:14.110
but you gotta be a Goddamn Jedi Knight as a driver already too.

2938
01:14:14.140 --> 01:14:15.850
You gotta know your shit as both.

2939
01:14:15.851 --> 01:14:19.210
So you know a helicopter pilots have to real sophisticated minds and that cause

2940
01:14:19.211 --> 01:14:22.450
you have the road and the rudder and you're basically negotiating two completely

2941
01:14:22.451 --> 01:14:23.450
separate things at once.

2942
01:14:23.451 --> 01:14:23.860
Yeah.

2943
01:14:23.860 --> 01:14:26.170
And these guys can invert and they can go upside down.

2944
01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:29.410
It's very complicated and it looks like it looks like a real sensitivity thing.

2945
01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:29.990
It is.

2946
01:14:29.990 --> 01:14:31.930
And you know who the most bad ass mother fuckers are?

2947
01:14:31.931 --> 01:14:33.280
The Vietnam helicopter pilots.

2948
01:14:33.281 --> 01:14:34.270
Cause you've gotta be able to fly,

2949
01:14:34.271 --> 01:14:36.520
extract men in a in and out and take fire.

2950
01:14:36.670 --> 01:14:37.550
Oh she is.

2951
01:14:37.730 --> 01:14:39.550
That's why they're all fucking cool and chill.

2952
01:14:39.580 --> 01:14:40.720
Vietnam helicopter pilots.

2953
01:14:40.721 --> 01:14:42.600
This is an amazing fucking pictures.

2954
01:14:42.610 --> 01:14:43.000
Videos.

2955
01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:43.900
So let's get one

2956
01:14:44.950 --> 01:14:46.120
<v 3>cause she was incredible.</v>

2957
01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:48.070
I know this guy that owns a helicopter,

2958
01:14:48.071 --> 01:14:53.071
a company here in Los Angeles and during the Carmageddon he was for $80 he would

2959
01:14:53.531 --> 01:14:56.500
like pick you up over here and take you to lax.

2960
01:14:57.080 --> 01:15:00.380
<v 1>The Carmen getting turned out to be nothing turned out to be the traffic was</v>

2961
01:15:00.381 --> 01:15:01.020
really light.

2962
01:15:01.020 --> 01:15:01.853
Yeah.

2963
01:15:02.220 --> 01:15:03.860
Everybody is smart and stayed home.

2964
01:15:04.340 --> 01:15:08.120
The real carmageddon is going to be an earthquake when we find out how fucking

2965
01:15:08.130 --> 01:15:09.230
trap we really are.

2966
01:15:10.350 --> 01:15:10.940
Yeah.

2967
01:15:10.940 --> 01:15:12.530
You ever see the movie or a quick breath?

2968
01:15:12.650 --> 01:15:13.070
No.

2969
01:15:13.070 --> 01:15:14.480
Which one was the access to the most recent?

2970
01:15:14.690 --> 01:15:16.760
I think Gerald didn't give me your hand.

2971
01:15:17.620 --> 01:15:18.560
It's so bad.

2972
01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:19.920
Like the camera's just shaping you.

2973
01:15:19.921 --> 01:15:20.170
They're like,

2974
01:15:20.170 --> 01:15:20.721
hey earthquake.

2975
01:15:20.721 --> 01:15:21.140
And it's like,

2976
01:15:21.140 --> 01:15:21.471
I was like,

2977
01:15:21.471 --> 01:15:23.330
this is like a 30 minute earthquake.

2978
01:15:23.660 --> 01:15:25.850
I mean this is going on for a long fucking time.

2979
01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:27.350
Earthquake last about two minutes.

2980
01:15:27.351 --> 01:15:27.710
I was like,

2981
01:15:27.710 --> 01:15:28.401
Jesus.

2982
01:15:28.401 --> 01:15:30.770
I think the one in Japan lasted a long time ago.

2983
01:15:30.790 --> 01:15:31.670
That was like forever.

2984
01:15:31.671 --> 01:15:32.504
It was just a,

2985
01:15:33.230 --> 01:15:36.260
I think that might've been like 30 minutes and be like,

2986
01:15:36.261 --> 01:15:37.460
let me off this mother fucker.

2987
01:15:37.820 --> 01:15:39.800
I would have liked to find out how many minutes that is.

2988
01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:40.440
<v 3>Eh,</v>

2989
01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:41.610
I don't know if it was 30 minutes,

2990
01:15:41.611 --> 01:15:44.580
but it was on and off for four hours,

2991
01:15:44.610 --> 01:15:45.910
wasn't it like a

2992
01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:50.510
<v 1>oh the aftershocks and she shot the aftershocks are ruthless man.</v>

2993
01:15:50.940 --> 01:15:51.171
You know,

2994
01:15:51.171 --> 01:15:54.290
aftershocks can be like an eight when you have a an earthquake,

2995
01:15:54.291 --> 01:15:55.730
that's a nine you know,

2996
01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:57.260
8.9 magnitude.

2997
01:15:57.420 --> 01:16:00.290
You know the aftershocks wood must be incredible.

2998
01:16:00.460 --> 01:16:00.660
Yeah,

2999
01:16:00.660 --> 01:16:01.460
I was living in,

3000
01:16:01.460 --> 01:16:01.701
sorry,

3001
01:16:01.701 --> 01:16:03.620
when I was living in Hollywood in [inaudible] 95 I got it.

3002
01:16:03.621 --> 01:16:03.951
I didn't,

3003
01:16:03.951 --> 01:16:05.450
wasn't here for the 94 earthquake,

3004
01:16:05.690 --> 01:16:07.610
but I was here right afterwards or was,

3005
01:16:07.611 --> 01:16:08.444
it wasn't the north.

3006
01:16:08.550 --> 01:16:12.920
Now he's at 94 [inaudible] 94 I went the route here literally two months later,

3007
01:16:13.190 --> 01:16:13.971
parts of the highway.

3008
01:16:13.971 --> 01:16:17.090
We're still fucking falling over and I wasn't here for the big one,

3009
01:16:17.091 --> 01:16:20.420
but I was here for a 5.5 5.5 to 5.7 something like that.

3010
01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:24.270
I was sitting in my apartment and all of a sudden the walls of the apartment and

3011
01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:25.430
a sway back and forth,

3012
01:16:25.431 --> 01:16:28.160
like I was in a refrigerator box and the crazy,

3013
01:16:28.490 --> 01:16:29.860
it didn't even seem real bad.

3014
01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:30.980
You feel about that big.

3015
01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:31.640
Yeah.

3016
01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:32.930
I felt like I was hallucinating.

3017
01:16:33.240 --> 01:16:34.370
We'll all just started moving.

3018
01:16:34.550 --> 01:16:35.540
It wasn't even a noise.

3019
01:16:35.630 --> 01:16:36.800
And then you hear some dog,

3020
01:16:36.801 --> 01:16:36.981
dog,

3021
01:16:36.981 --> 01:16:37.181
dog,

3022
01:16:37.181 --> 01:16:37.541
dog,

3023
01:16:37.541 --> 01:16:38.090
dog.

3024
01:16:38.090 --> 01:16:38.480
Yeah.

3025
01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:39.291
Just crazy.

3026
01:16:39.291 --> 01:16:39.591
Thump,

3027
01:16:39.591 --> 01:16:39.821
thump,

3028
01:16:39.821 --> 01:16:40.160
thump.

3029
01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:43.670
So like you could hear the earth literally moving and making noise.

3030
01:16:43.671 --> 01:16:46.040
Like rock SLAAC a sliding next to each other.

3031
01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:47.313
Yeah.

3032
01:16:47.810 --> 01:16:48.643
That's fucking,

3033
01:16:49.370 --> 01:16:50.000
don't you feel like,

3034
01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:50.570
like I felt,

3035
01:16:50.570 --> 01:16:52.710
I felt when I'm like,

3036
01:16:52.740 --> 01:16:52.900
why?

3037
01:16:52.900 --> 01:16:54.500
I remember so well it was Monday,

3038
01:16:54.501 --> 01:16:56.270
September 10th,

3039
01:16:56.270 --> 01:16:56.991
2001 there was an earthquake.

3040
01:16:56.991 --> 01:16:58.520
It's about 4.5 wow.

3041
01:16:58.521 --> 01:17:01.580
And it shook me up and I was reeling from trimet and obviously the next day

3042
01:17:01.581 --> 01:17:02.480
something bigger happen.

3043
01:17:02.510 --> 01:17:02.870
Right.

3044
01:17:02.870 --> 01:17:04.850
And I mean maybe it was like that weekend or something,

3045
01:17:04.851 --> 01:17:06.590
but I remember it was my first like,

3046
01:17:06.710 --> 01:17:07.130
you know,

3047
01:17:07.130 --> 01:17:08.090
moderate earthquake.

3048
01:17:08.300 --> 01:17:09.950
Now I won't up unless it's like,

3049
01:17:09.951 --> 01:17:10.040
you

3050
01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:10.221
<v 2>know,</v>

3051
01:17:10.221 --> 01:17:11.240
Shit's really moving.

3052
01:17:11.241 --> 01:17:12.860
But I was in an apartment to time.

3053
01:17:12.861 --> 01:17:16.220
It was swaying and then it was eerily quiet and then all of a sudden,

3054
01:17:16.221 --> 01:17:17.780
yeah you heard that shifting and shit.

3055
01:17:18.050 --> 01:17:19.100
But I felt so helpless.

3056
01:17:19.101 --> 01:17:19.431
I was like,

3057
01:17:19.431 --> 01:17:20.780
there's nobody you could call.

3058
01:17:20.781 --> 01:17:22.380
This is one big bad beats.

3059
01:17:22.381 --> 01:17:24.350
There's nobody who could kick this earthquakes ass.

3060
01:17:24.650 --> 01:17:27.950
And you feel about that small cause you realize man and you think God,

3061
01:17:27.951 --> 01:17:30.230
you don't live in some third world where we're all made a dirt.

3062
01:17:30.540 --> 01:17:31.190
You know what I mean?

3063
01:17:31.190 --> 01:17:31.580
Yeah.

3064
01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:34.370
Cause it's like we have pretty good infrastructure here and it's still will go

3065
01:17:34.371 --> 01:17:34.710
down.

3066
01:17:34.710 --> 01:17:36.180
<v 0>Well we have to accept the fact that the,</v>

3067
01:17:36.220 --> 01:17:36.520
the,

3068
01:17:36.520 --> 01:17:37.353
the top,

3069
01:17:37.470 --> 01:17:40.620
the top of topographical surface of the earth,

3070
01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:42.300
the surface of the earth changes.

3071
01:17:42.510 --> 01:17:44.520
It changes the topography constantly.

3072
01:17:44.670 --> 01:17:45.000
You know,

3073
01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:45.833
we know that,

3074
01:17:45.870 --> 01:17:46.051
you know,

3075
01:17:46.051 --> 01:17:50.220
there's like fish bones and shift that you can find in Montana through tectonics

3076
01:17:50.230 --> 01:17:52.350
or only fine because everything moves.

3077
01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:53.700
Everything is constantly moving.

3078
01:17:53.701 --> 01:17:54.120
You know,

3079
01:17:54.120 --> 01:17:55.590
they know that mega dawn's,

3080
01:17:55.690 --> 01:17:57.840
they found mega don teeth in Montana.

3081
01:17:58.150 --> 01:18:00.540
So Montana at one point in time was like under the ocean.

3082
01:18:01.710 --> 01:18:03.690
We know that this whole thing used to be pangea.

3083
01:18:03.691 --> 01:18:06.750
It used to be one giant continent and something happened.

3084
01:18:06.930 --> 01:18:10.470
Or supposedly that's the most widely accepted theory until someone comes up with

3085
01:18:10.471 --> 01:18:10.950
a better one.

3086
01:18:10.950 --> 01:18:11.041
Well,

3087
01:18:11.041 --> 01:18:12.560
I mean you put all of those countries together,

3088
01:18:12.570 --> 01:18:13.070
they,

3089
01:18:13.070 --> 01:18:13.903
they fit.

3090
01:18:13.930 --> 01:18:14.370
Yeah.

3091
01:18:14.370 --> 01:18:15.050
And Shit.

3092
01:18:15.050 --> 01:18:16.380
Shit changes and moves man.

3093
01:18:16.381 --> 01:18:17.490
And we just got to accept that.

3094
01:18:17.490 --> 01:18:20.370
And sometimes the spot you're at sucks now,

3095
01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:20.701
you know,

3096
01:18:20.701 --> 01:18:21.410
it changes,

3097
01:18:21.410 --> 01:18:22.230
you know,

3098
01:18:22.230 --> 01:18:25.980
the Bering strait things come along and steal things up or we fucked up like

3099
01:18:25.981 --> 01:18:26.490
Japan,

3100
01:18:26.490 --> 01:18:30.360
human beings fucked up and created some spot where you can't hang out anymore.

3101
01:18:30.550 --> 01:18:31.050
You know,

3102
01:18:31.050 --> 01:18:32.970
we're going to put a fence up around this and you know,

3103
01:18:32.971 --> 01:18:35.100
put some big skull and crossbones.

3104
01:18:35.101 --> 01:18:35.934
Shit,

3105
01:18:35.950 --> 01:18:36.783
don't go near.

3106
01:18:37.130 --> 01:18:39.030
We broke one of the spots.

3107
01:18:39.031 --> 01:18:39.420
Yeah,

3108
01:18:39.420 --> 01:18:40.081
we fucked it up.

3109
01:18:40.081 --> 01:18:41.160
We broke up for good Kermit.

3110
01:18:41.250 --> 01:18:41.810
Yeah.

3111
01:18:41.810 --> 01:18:42.180
You know,

3112
01:18:42.180 --> 01:18:42.781
and that's the,

3113
01:18:42.781 --> 01:18:44.400
the earth is constantly gonna Shift.

3114
01:18:44.420 --> 01:18:45.170
There's no,

3115
01:18:45.170 --> 01:18:49.950
we know that for a fact that the North Pole is moving towards Russia at some

3116
01:18:49.951 --> 01:18:50.511
sort of a,

3117
01:18:50.511 --> 01:18:55.511
a crazy pace of like 35 miles a year to the point where the pole is shifting and

3118
01:18:55.801 --> 01:18:57.390
they apparently had to,

3119
01:18:57.660 --> 01:19:00.750
they had to reroute some planes in Florida.

3120
01:19:00.751 --> 01:19:04.500
They had to do something to the runway to adjust for the fact that it's moving.

3121
01:19:04.501 --> 01:19:06.270
The poll is moving in a certain direction.

3122
01:19:06.271 --> 01:19:09.240
You could see it visually like it within even a hundred years.

3123
01:19:09.241 --> 01:19:09.900
That's scary.

3124
01:19:09.900 --> 01:19:10.351
It's crazy.

3125
01:19:10.351 --> 01:19:10.831
You know what I mean?

3126
01:19:10.831 --> 01:19:11.551
Apparently though,

3127
01:19:11.551 --> 01:19:12.810
that's inevitable.

3128
01:19:12.811 --> 01:19:14.490
That's just how it always goes.

3129
01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:18.450
We're confused into thinking that the state that this country is in right now is

3130
01:19:18.451 --> 01:19:19.950
the state that it stays in forever.

3131
01:19:19.980 --> 01:19:20.431
That's what we did.

3132
01:19:20.431 --> 01:19:22.140
We plant our flag here and nothing will change,

3133
01:19:22.370 --> 01:19:23.190
but it's like in Venice,

3134
01:19:23.190 --> 01:19:23.521
Italy,

3135
01:19:23.521 --> 01:19:24.060
all of it.

3136
01:19:24.060 --> 01:19:26.750
They're going on there and there's nothing they can do in Venice.

3137
01:19:27.430 --> 01:19:29.170
<v 2>What happened with Venice here in California,</v>

3138
01:19:29.171 --> 01:19:29.711
they tried it.

3139
01:19:29.711 --> 01:19:30.640
It just didn't work out,

3140
01:19:30.820 --> 01:19:34.370
but it's like eventually earth is constantly changing you.

3141
01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:37.000
Dennis is going to be gone in a hundred years gone.

3142
01:19:37.060 --> 01:19:38.380
That's what I mean is completely submerged.

3143
01:19:38.550 --> 01:19:38.821
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

3144
01:19:38.821 --> 01:19:39.020
Well the,

3145
01:19:39.020 --> 01:19:40.680
unless they can come up with some engineering,

3146
01:19:42.180 --> 01:19:44.250
but you're really fighting things off like in New Orleans.

3147
01:19:44.670 --> 01:19:44.821
Well,

3148
01:19:44.821 --> 01:19:45.151
you are,

3149
01:19:45.151 --> 01:19:45.631
but that's,

3150
01:19:45.631 --> 01:19:46.800
that's still a possibility.

3151
01:19:47.300 --> 01:19:47.730
You know,

3152
01:19:47.730 --> 01:19:48.450
I don't,

3153
01:19:48.450 --> 01:19:49.800
I don't think that's the right way to do it,

3154
01:19:49.801 --> 01:19:52.500
but try to convince everybody to get out of there,

3155
01:19:52.950 --> 01:19:53.311
you know?

3156
01:19:53.311 --> 01:19:54.300
And then everybody wants to go,

3157
01:19:54.330 --> 01:19:54.481
oh,

3158
01:19:54.481 --> 01:19:55.350
but the history,

3159
01:19:55.830 --> 01:19:56.100
no,

3160
01:19:56.100 --> 01:19:56.730
that's cool.

3161
01:19:56.730 --> 01:19:57.001
You know,

3162
01:19:57.001 --> 01:19:58.140
there's some awesome real estate.

3163
01:19:58.141 --> 01:19:58.890
It's called Atlanta.

3164
01:19:58.890 --> 01:20:00.000
It's off the coast of Spain.

3165
01:20:00.170 --> 01:20:01.830
You fucking know go out there too.

3166
01:20:01.831 --> 01:20:03.290
They didn't want to abandon that shit either.

3167
01:20:03.660 --> 01:20:04.141
They loved it.

3168
01:20:04.141 --> 01:20:05.670
It was the best civilization ever,

3169
01:20:06.250 --> 01:20:06.601
you know,

3170
01:20:06.601 --> 01:20:07.430
and it,

3171
01:20:07.430 --> 01:20:07.650
you know,

3172
01:20:07.650 --> 01:20:08.371
things change,

3173
01:20:08.371 --> 01:20:08.971
things shift.

3174
01:20:08.971 --> 01:20:09.780
You've got to keep moving.

3175
01:20:09.780 --> 01:20:11.550
You know what an idea I heard recently that I kind of,

3176
01:20:11.570 --> 01:20:14.430
I thought it was the most credible one about,

3177
01:20:14.431 --> 01:20:14.960
um,

3178
01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:15.610
um,

3179
01:20:15.610 --> 01:20:16.411
how did Easter island,

3180
01:20:16.411 --> 01:20:16.741
but the,

3181
01:20:16.741 --> 01:20:16.951
the,

3182
01:20:16.951 --> 01:20:17.640
the um,

3183
01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:18.180
what do you call it?

3184
01:20:18.180 --> 01:20:21.660
The Stonehenge through wintertime on ice.

3185
01:20:22.020 --> 01:20:23.370
Ever hear of that one winter time?

3186
01:20:23.371 --> 01:20:24.420
Would they moved them on ice?

3187
01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:25.320
I just did it on ice.

3188
01:20:25.321 --> 01:20:26.154
You ever heard of that thing?

3189
01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:29.310
I guess that would work if you had enough ice so they could ice up there.

3190
01:20:29.340 --> 01:20:32.750
Cause I think the weather is that it feels like you would have to have like a,

3191
01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:36.990
you would have to like really lay it down nice and thick and then even then what

3192
01:20:36.991 --> 01:20:38.160
support that kind of weight.

3193
01:20:38.170 --> 01:20:40.170
But they were saying like the idea that there was no tracks,

3194
01:20:40.171 --> 01:20:41.100
there was no evidence of it.

3195
01:20:41.101 --> 01:20:41.521
But it's like,

3196
01:20:41.521 --> 01:20:41.731
you know,

3197
01:20:41.731 --> 01:20:42.660
when you don't have TV,

3198
01:20:42.661 --> 01:20:45.120
your mind can come up with creative shit to move things.

3199
01:20:45.121 --> 01:20:45.954
It's like I don't,

3200
01:20:46.110 --> 01:20:47.790
what do you do you think they were put there by aliens?

3201
01:20:47.791 --> 01:20:48.600
I don't know man.

3202
01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:49.590
Put them there and it's just too,

3203
01:20:49.591 --> 01:20:52.410
we had the guy from ancient aliens on the last podcast,

3204
01:20:52.411 --> 01:20:53.244
the last episode.

3205
01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:53.971
I got to listen to that one.

3206
01:20:53.971 --> 01:20:55.440
I didn't listen a lot of interesting one.

3207
01:20:55.590 --> 01:20:56.370
Um,

3208
01:20:56.370 --> 01:20:56.671
you know,

3209
01:20:56.671 --> 01:20:57.031
he's,

3210
01:20:57.031 --> 01:20:57.450
uh,

3211
01:20:57.450 --> 01:21:00.720
he's really a big proponent of what's called the,

3212
01:21:00.740 --> 01:21:01.573
um,

3213
01:21:01.620 --> 01:21:04.980
the ancient alien or a alien astronaut theory that,

3214
01:21:05.010 --> 01:21:05.280
you know,

3215
01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:06.660
earth who was seated or at least,

3216
01:21:06.661 --> 01:21:06.901
you know,

3217
01:21:06.901 --> 01:21:08.730
we were given some information or some,

3218
01:21:08.731 --> 01:21:11.400
some technology at one point in the past by aliens.

3219
01:21:11.580 --> 01:21:12.870
And he's 100% convinced.

3220
01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:14.280
I'm not 100% convinced,

3221
01:21:14.281 --> 01:21:16.200
but I think it's a fascinating topic.

3222
01:21:16.230 --> 01:21:16.501
You know,

3223
01:21:16.501 --> 01:21:16.680
it's,

3224
01:21:16.680 --> 01:21:17.550
it's a very sexy,

3225
01:21:17.551 --> 01:21:19.650
just like big foot and it's very sexy.

3226
01:21:19.651 --> 01:21:19.861
It's a,

3227
01:21:19.861 --> 01:21:20.161
it's a,

3228
01:21:20.161 --> 01:21:21.240
it's an interesting topic,

3229
01:21:21.241 --> 01:21:21.750
you know,

3230
01:21:21.750 --> 01:21:22.201
I think,

3231
01:21:22.201 --> 01:21:22.500
uh,

3232
01:21:22.500 --> 01:21:23.670
it's certainly possible,

3233
01:21:23.730 --> 01:21:24.001
you know,

3234
01:21:24.001 --> 01:21:24.271
I mean,

3235
01:21:24.271 --> 01:21:24.481
look,

3236
01:21:24.481 --> 01:21:26.550
if we know that if we can send something to Mars,

3237
01:21:26.551 --> 01:21:27.780
even if there's not a person in it,

3238
01:21:27.990 --> 01:21:32.250
just extrapolate the fact that as technology grows at an exponential rate,

3239
01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:32.880
ego,

3240
01:21:32.880 --> 01:21:34.140
a thousand years from now,

3241
01:21:34.141 --> 01:21:37.020
just this society will be able to do something crazy like visit some other

3242
01:21:37.021 --> 01:21:37.770
planet.

3243
01:21:37.770 --> 01:21:41.460
So we know that it's within the grasp of potential.

3244
01:21:41.461 --> 01:21:42.900
It's within the grasp of reality.

3245
01:21:43.110 --> 01:21:44.250
I just feel like the way we are,

3246
01:21:44.251 --> 01:21:45.480
and with the Internet and everything now,

3247
01:21:45.481 --> 01:21:47.940
I think we're do something monumental in our lifetime.

3248
01:21:47.941 --> 01:21:49.050
And I mean monumental like,

3249
01:21:49.080 --> 01:21:49.720
you know,

3250
01:21:49.720 --> 01:21:52.410
I use a big foot thing as an example or a loch ness,

3251
01:21:52.411 --> 01:21:52.981
whatever it is,

3252
01:21:52.981 --> 01:21:56.670
just something really amazingly monumental that will galvanize the world to at

3253
01:21:56.671 --> 01:21:57.900
least for a day or two and go,

3254
01:21:57.901 --> 01:21:59.250
holy fucking shit.

3255
01:21:59.610 --> 01:22:00.443
You know what I mean?

3256
01:22:00.540 --> 01:22:03.330
We have this weird desire to uncover hidden secrets.

3257
01:22:03.331 --> 01:22:03.511
You know,

3258
01:22:03.511 --> 01:22:04.021
people love.

3259
01:22:04.021 --> 01:22:05.130
That's why we love mysteries,

3260
01:22:05.131 --> 01:22:05.491
man.

3261
01:22:05.491 --> 01:22:05.850
You know,

3262
01:22:05.850 --> 01:22:07.800
I got sucked into watching uh,

3263
01:22:07.950 --> 01:22:10.290
one of those 48 hour mystery shows,

3264
01:22:10.291 --> 01:22:10.471
you know,

3265
01:22:10.471 --> 01:22:12.390
those real live shows last night.

3266
01:22:12.420 --> 01:22:12.870
Wow.

3267
01:22:12.870 --> 01:22:13.681
There's a good one too,

3268
01:22:13.681 --> 01:22:13.921
man.

3269
01:22:13.921 --> 01:22:14.670
They got me,

3270
01:22:14.670 --> 01:22:18.840
it was a preacher that killed his wife and the wife and the mother of his

3271
01:22:18.841 --> 01:22:21.420
children because he was having an affair with his younger holler.

3272
01:22:21.430 --> 01:22:23.250
Cheddar's newsmagazine the,

3273
01:22:23.390 --> 01:22:24.060
yeah.

3274
01:22:24.060 --> 01:22:24.893
When the guy,

3275
01:22:24.970 --> 01:22:27.990
he always says that he's got a great voice hour special on a man.

3276
01:22:27.991 --> 01:22:29.430
I watched the shit out of that show.

3277
01:22:29.910 --> 01:22:31.860
It was creepy as fuck this dude grow.

3278
01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:32.310
I mean,

3279
01:22:32.310 --> 01:22:32.581
man,

3280
01:22:32.581 --> 01:22:33.570
he was such an idiot.

3281
01:22:33.571 --> 01:22:35.460
Like he left his tracks everywhere.

3282
01:22:35.461 --> 01:22:35.730
I mean,

3283
01:22:35.730 --> 01:22:37.020
he did everything wrong.

3284
01:22:37.050 --> 01:22:37.750
This guy,

3285
01:22:37.750 --> 01:22:38.700
I mean from,

3286
01:22:38.730 --> 01:22:40.950
from talking to nine one one,

3287
01:22:41.190 --> 01:22:41.371
I mean,

3288
01:22:41.371 --> 01:22:45.540
he was talking to downland one and supposedly putting clothes on her while he

3289
01:22:45.541 --> 01:22:46.410
was talking to her.

3290
01:22:46.590 --> 01:22:47.281
She's dead weight,

3291
01:22:47.281 --> 01:22:48.180
completely unconscious.

3292
01:22:48.330 --> 01:22:51.390
And he supposedly has the phone up to his ear and he's like,

3293
01:22:51.410 --> 01:22:53.430
like he didn't even think it through at all.

3294
01:22:53.590 --> 01:22:54.570
Folks just can't be,

3295
01:22:55.260 --> 01:22:56.610
he's a fucking idiot.

3296
01:22:56.790 --> 01:22:58.290
But he,

3297
01:22:58.291 --> 01:22:58.530
uh,

3298
01:22:58.530 --> 01:23:01.290
was banging this hottie she was pretty hot though.

3299
01:23:01.350 --> 01:23:02.131
She's kind of Chubby,

3300
01:23:02.131 --> 01:23:02.964
but hot as fuck.

3301
01:23:03.210 --> 01:23:04.043
She's really pretty.

3302
01:23:04.260 --> 01:23:04.831
And He,

3303
01:23:04.831 --> 01:23:05.110
uh,

3304
01:23:05.110 --> 01:23:07.840
he killed her for her and he even told her,

3305
01:23:07.841 --> 01:23:11.980
he told her he killed her to be with her and then she left him and he was like,

3306
01:23:11.981 --> 01:23:12.220
you know,

3307
01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:12.790
hey man,

3308
01:23:12.790 --> 01:23:15.490
I fucking killed my wife to be with you and you leave me,

3309
01:23:15.730 --> 01:23:16.010
you know?

3310
01:23:16.010 --> 01:23:16.571
And then she was like,

3311
01:23:16.571 --> 01:23:16.961
oh my God,

3312
01:23:16.961 --> 01:23:17.771
he's going to kill me too.

3313
01:23:17.771 --> 01:23:19.720
So then she started talking to the cops,

3314
01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:20.861
but before then,

3315
01:23:20.861 --> 01:23:21.820
apparently she was,

3316
01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:22.211
you know,

3317
01:23:22.211 --> 01:23:23.290
she was trying to tell the cops,

3318
01:23:23.291 --> 01:23:23.650
nope,

3319
01:23:23.650 --> 01:23:23.950
nope,

3320
01:23:23.950 --> 01:23:25.240
never fucked them.

3321
01:23:25.241 --> 01:23:26.590
We're not having an affair.

3322
01:23:26.770 --> 01:23:28.840
She denied the affair and then,

3323
01:23:28.841 --> 01:23:29.111
you know,

3324
01:23:29.111 --> 01:23:30.730
he threatened her that she would,

3325
01:23:30.760 --> 01:23:31.001
you know,

3326
01:23:31.001 --> 01:23:32.320
he would kill her if she told anybody.

3327
01:23:32.321 --> 01:23:32.740
And she really,

3328
01:23:32.740 --> 01:23:35.230
she goes and testifies on the witness stand,

3329
01:23:35.530 --> 01:23:36.640
but it's so crazy,

3330
01:23:36.641 --> 01:23:36.821
man.

3331
01:23:36.821 --> 01:23:37.654
The emotions,

3332
01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:39.760
the real raw emotions of seeing,

3333
01:23:39.800 --> 01:23:40.330
uh,

3334
01:23:40.330 --> 01:23:41.770
that woman who he,

3335
01:23:42.110 --> 01:23:42.461
you know,

3336
01:23:42.461 --> 01:23:44.380
was living with those that he said he loved her.

3337
01:23:44.390 --> 01:23:44.591
They were,

3338
01:23:44.591 --> 01:23:45.610
fuck they're having sex.

3339
01:23:45.820 --> 01:23:50.680
And she's on the witness stand telling everyone that he killed his wife and that

3340
01:23:50.681 --> 01:23:51.940
he explained how he did it,

3341
01:23:51.941 --> 01:23:55.840
how he smothered her with a pillow and how she was gasping for air.

3342
01:23:55.930 --> 01:23:57.760
And then he thought she was already dead from the pills,

3343
01:23:57.761 --> 01:23:59.050
but she started gasping for air.

3344
01:23:59.140 --> 01:24:02.410
So then he smothered her mouth with a pillow I get is some dark,

3345
01:24:02.470 --> 01:24:03.100
dark,

3346
01:24:03.100 --> 01:24:04.000
dark shit.

3347
01:24:04.150 --> 01:24:05.770
And all the while they're looking over at the,

3348
01:24:05.780 --> 01:24:06.070
the,

3349
01:24:06.070 --> 01:24:06.490
you know,

3350
01:24:06.490 --> 01:24:07.380
focused in on the,

3351
01:24:07.381 --> 01:24:11.040
the preacher and his eyes are shifting back and forth and left and right.

3352
01:24:11.070 --> 01:24:11.560
You're like,

3353
01:24:11.560 --> 01:24:12.560
<v 2>oh,</v>

3354
01:24:12.580 --> 01:24:13.380
this is so

3355
01:24:13.380 --> 01:24:14.213
<v 0>creepy.</v>

3356
01:24:14.220 --> 01:24:15.053
Dark.

3357
01:24:15.420 --> 01:24:16.800
Why don't you just break up with her,

3358
01:24:16.801 --> 01:24:19.290
you fuck head while the wife of his,

3359
01:24:19.410 --> 01:24:21.060
the mother of his children to the,

3360
01:24:21.061 --> 01:24:22.320
it's two cute little girls.

3361
01:24:22.321 --> 01:24:23.310
You kind of wonder where somebody is.

3362
01:24:23.311 --> 01:24:24.120
Mine is when it's like,

3363
01:24:24.120 --> 01:24:24.511
oh,

3364
01:24:24.511 --> 01:24:25.290
I'll murder them.

3365
01:24:25.290 --> 01:24:26.370
That's what I'll do there.

3366
01:24:26.371 --> 01:24:27.181
They're figuring,

3367
01:24:27.181 --> 01:24:27.480
look,

3368
01:24:27.480 --> 01:24:30.570
they're bullshitting people all day long with this religion,

3369
01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:31.680
with this nonsense.

3370
01:24:31.710 --> 01:24:32.371
They're not living,

3371
01:24:32.371 --> 01:24:33.540
they're not living this way at all.

3372
01:24:33.690 --> 01:24:35.140
They're not real Christian.

3373
01:24:35.141 --> 01:24:35.761
So many of them,

3374
01:24:35.761 --> 01:24:39.000
they get a taste of that power and the girls are smiling and next thing you know

3375
01:24:39.001 --> 01:24:40.520
they're getting their dick sucked in the back.

3376
01:24:40.790 --> 01:24:40.911
<v 2>Well,</v>

3377
01:24:40.911 --> 01:24:41.320
it's like they,

3378
01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:43.670
it works as a perfect disguise for them because not only,

3379
01:24:43.671 --> 01:24:44.780
you're not going to suspect them,

3380
01:24:44.781 --> 01:24:47.420
they're going to be able to get away with anything they want to all day until

3381
01:24:47.421 --> 01:24:47.751
it's like,

3382
01:24:47.751 --> 01:24:48.171
but you know what?

3383
01:24:48.171 --> 01:24:51.590
Irony always tells you it's like a guy that that's that against gay people get

3384
01:24:51.591 --> 01:24:54.830
married to the guy getting dry hand jobs on the side from little boy,

3385
01:24:55.280 --> 01:24:56.270
but fucking dudes.

3386
01:24:56.271 --> 01:24:56.930
You know what I mean?

3387
01:24:56.930 --> 01:24:57.170
Yeah.

3388
01:24:57.170 --> 01:24:58.003
Back in pooped,

3389
01:24:58.040 --> 01:24:58.880
it's exactly what it is,

3390
01:24:58.881 --> 01:24:59.061
man.

3391
01:24:59.061 --> 01:25:00.500
They're trying to throw you off course.

3392
01:25:00.710 --> 01:25:01.431
The trying to let you know,

3393
01:25:01.431 --> 01:25:02.131
I'm on your side.

3394
01:25:02.131 --> 01:25:02.990
You're just God damn queries.

3395
01:25:02.991 --> 01:25:03.824
What are they doing it all?

3396
01:25:03.970 --> 01:25:08.130
I've never done anything to anybody to hurt anybody and apparently they're

3397
01:25:08.131 --> 01:25:11.630
staying married a lot more than heterosexuals are keeping it together.

3398
01:25:11.631 --> 01:25:13.700
That's queers and we got there.

3399
01:25:13.701 --> 01:25:14.001
Brian,

3400
01:25:14.001 --> 01:25:14.834
what are you holding up?

3401
01:25:15.470 --> 01:25:16.640
This is a video on youtube.

3402
01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:18.980
It's gotten like almost 6 million hits.

3403
01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:21.680
I this guy built Stonehenge by himself.

3404
01:25:22.110 --> 01:25:22.980
His own version of it.

3405
01:25:23.450 --> 01:25:27.730
Using only like ropes and would straight poolies lippers.

3406
01:25:27.740 --> 01:25:28.130
Yeah,

3407
01:25:28.130 --> 01:25:28.851
it's on Youtube.

3408
01:25:28.851 --> 01:25:30.740
It's called building stone head and shit.

3409
01:25:30.741 --> 01:25:31.910
The man who can move anything.

3410
01:25:31.940 --> 01:25:32.480
Oh Wow.

3411
01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:33.200
That's pretty cool.

3412
01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:33.501
Yeah.

3413
01:25:33.501 --> 01:25:33.960
I mean

3414
01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:34.531
<v 0>the idea of that,</v>

3415
01:25:34.531 --> 01:25:37.290
people always say that it's impossible for people to move those today.

3416
01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:38.101
I always go,

3417
01:25:38.101 --> 01:25:38.820
man,

3418
01:25:38.820 --> 01:25:39.990
how can you say impossible?

3419
01:25:39.991 --> 01:25:40.280
Yeah.

3420
01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:43.740
That can't say impossible because levers and fulcrums are fucking amazing.

3421
01:25:43.741 --> 01:25:46.270
They allow men to move massive thing.

3422
01:25:46.350 --> 01:25:47.430
There's a video,

3423
01:25:47.490 --> 01:25:48.750
a photo online.

3424
01:25:48.751 --> 01:25:52.410
I guess there's video of it to have this gigantic earth crushing machine if they

3425
01:25:52.411 --> 01:25:53.244
haven't in Russia.

3426
01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:58.520
It's like it digs tunnels and it's so goddamn big stress.

3427
01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:02.910
I wouldn't even know this thing exists like a thousand feet a day.

3428
01:26:02.911 --> 01:26:04.340
It tear down or something like that.

3429
01:26:04.370 --> 01:26:05.600
If it wasn't for the Internet,

3430
01:26:05.630 --> 01:26:07.100
I would never know this existed.

3431
01:26:07.101 --> 01:26:11.660
I would think this is just like some fucking like a a fake machine and a John

3432
01:26:11.660 --> 01:26:12.800
Carpenter movie about space.

3433
01:26:12.801 --> 01:26:13.520
You know what I mean?

3434
01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:17.450
But meanwhile it is real and these things can just do insane things to move

3435
01:26:17.451 --> 01:26:19.130
earth and you stop and think about it,

3436
01:26:19.131 --> 01:26:19.610
man,

3437
01:26:19.610 --> 01:26:20.443
look,

3438
01:26:20.750 --> 01:26:25.370
human beings are capable of ingenious feats and whether it's building some giant

3439
01:26:25.371 --> 01:26:29.930
machine to move things or figuring out some crazy series of levers and,

3440
01:26:29.931 --> 01:26:30.071
and,

3441
01:26:30.071 --> 01:26:33.650
and wedges and dedicating all this time to doing it.

3442
01:26:33.650 --> 01:26:33.850
It's,

3443
01:26:33.850 --> 01:26:38.850
it's very possible that they had some in insane like technological capabilities

3444
01:26:40.190 --> 01:26:43.730
that we don't credit them for because it's just too many thousands of years ago

3445
01:26:43.970 --> 01:26:44.451
and we don't,

3446
01:26:44.451 --> 01:26:46.010
we don't know what there,

3447
01:26:46.380 --> 01:26:49.130
during the fire at the library of Alexandria,

3448
01:26:49.250 --> 01:26:50.240
we lost everything.

3449
01:26:50.241 --> 01:26:51.680
We lost all their written work.

3450
01:26:51.681 --> 01:26:52.010
Right.

3451
01:26:52.010 --> 01:26:53.090
Their history and you know,

3452
01:26:53.091 --> 01:26:54.320
so there's a lot of it.

3453
01:26:54.321 --> 01:26:56.640
They're trying to piece together what the Egyptians couldn't,

3454
01:26:56.660 --> 01:26:57.410
couldn't do well they,

3455
01:26:57.410 --> 01:26:57.670
they,

3456
01:26:57.670 --> 01:26:57.920
you know,

3457
01:26:57.920 --> 01:27:01.460
and I've seen a lot of the ideas of how they got each of the things together.

3458
01:27:01.461 --> 01:27:03.490
But what surprises me is that the GMS,

3459
01:27:03.530 --> 01:27:04.880
that geometric and the,

3460
01:27:04.970 --> 01:27:06.320
all the accuracy behind it,

3461
01:27:06.350 --> 01:27:07.183
that's amazing.

3462
01:27:07.250 --> 01:27:08.083
That's what's the,

3463
01:27:08.120 --> 01:27:10.040
it's not the lifting that impresses me.

3464
01:27:10.041 --> 01:27:11.810
It's the geometry to the point.

3465
01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:12.830
More so than any,

3466
01:27:13.040 --> 01:27:14.520
any other manmade device can,

3467
01:27:14.530 --> 01:27:16.490
can pinpoint things in the world.

3468
01:27:16.491 --> 01:27:17.050
It's like,

3469
01:27:17.050 --> 01:27:17.421
you know,

3470
01:27:17.421 --> 01:27:17.640
the,

3471
01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:18.740
they did it amazing.

3472
01:27:18.770 --> 01:27:22.010
They did it so that it's very close to pointing at perfect north,

3473
01:27:22.011 --> 01:27:22.341
south,

3474
01:27:22.341 --> 01:27:23.000
east and west.

3475
01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:24.730
And they reconciled the,

3476
01:27:24.910 --> 01:27:29.910
the lack of perfection with the procession of the equinoxes every 26,000 years,

3477
01:27:30.321 --> 01:27:33.170
there's a cycle and the earth wobbles on its axis,

3478
01:27:33.171 --> 01:27:35.180
so it changes the night sky changes.

3479
01:27:35.181 --> 01:27:39.680
So it's the way it points to certain constellations and stuff is off or on,

3480
01:27:39.681 --> 01:27:41.780
depending on the procession of the equinoxes,

3481
01:27:42.170 --> 01:27:42.480
you know?

3482
01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:43.110
So it's,

3483
01:27:43.110 --> 01:27:43.450
it's,

3484
01:27:43.450 --> 01:27:43.760
there's,

3485
01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:44.210
it's,

3486
01:27:44.210 --> 01:27:46.190
it's amazing what they did mathematically,

3487
01:27:46.191 --> 01:27:47.040
but it's,

3488
01:27:47.090 --> 01:27:48.980
it seems to be that it can be done.

3489
01:27:48.981 --> 01:27:49.520
Yeah.

3490
01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:50.470
I mean be done with,

3491
01:27:50.530 --> 01:27:50.720
with,

3492
01:27:50.720 --> 01:27:51.690
with the animals and,

3493
01:27:51.691 --> 01:27:52.041
and,

3494
01:27:52.041 --> 01:27:54.350
and slave labor for the love of God.

3495
01:27:54.351 --> 01:27:56.780
They say though that they don't believe it was slave labor.

3496
01:27:56.781 --> 01:28:00.680
Now they believe that they were paid well and that they were a w considered

3497
01:28:00.681 --> 01:28:01.610
working craftsmen.

3498
01:28:01.640 --> 01:28:05.900
Maybe it was like during the great depression when they erected the empire state

3499
01:28:05.901 --> 01:28:06.360
building and,

3500
01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:06.830
and,

3501
01:28:06.830 --> 01:28:07.920
and the uh,

3502
01:28:07.960 --> 01:28:08.830
the um,

3503
01:28:09.030 --> 01:28:09.950
the Chrysler building.

3504
01:28:10.070 --> 01:28:10.371
It's like,

3505
01:28:10.371 --> 01:28:10.641
okay,

3506
01:28:10.641 --> 01:28:14.360
let's provide jobs and these are great jobs for guys in need of work.

3507
01:28:14.361 --> 01:28:15.230
So it makes sense,

3508
01:28:15.231 --> 01:28:15.501
right?

3509
01:28:15.501 --> 01:28:16.191
All come one,

3510
01:28:16.191 --> 01:28:16.521
come all,

3511
01:28:16.521 --> 01:28:18.380
we're building this fucking amazing thing.

3512
01:28:18.440 --> 01:28:21.380
But I think they respected people's ability to construct them.

3513
01:28:21.381 --> 01:28:26.120
I think one of the reasons for this conclusion is that they found some sites,

3514
01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:29.210
home sites of the workers and the food that they had,

3515
01:28:29.211 --> 01:28:29.521
like the,

3516
01:28:29.521 --> 01:28:31.040
the bones and stuff was like,

3517
01:28:31.370 --> 01:28:31.611
you know,

3518
01:28:31.611 --> 01:28:32.980
high end food and that the,

3519
01:28:32.981 --> 01:28:35.210
the clothing was like fairly high end.

3520
01:28:35.410 --> 01:28:37.310
And so that what they were looking at was like saying like,

3521
01:28:37.311 --> 01:28:40.490
well these people aren't slaves eating slop because people seem to be getting

3522
01:28:40.491 --> 01:28:42.800
good food and good clothing and go out there.

3523
01:28:42.801 --> 01:28:43.634
Probably not.

3524
01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:44.810
Well,

3525
01:28:44.810 --> 01:28:47.750
I think they found bones and certain things that indicated that they were,

3526
01:28:47.751 --> 01:28:48.170
you know,

3527
01:28:48.170 --> 01:28:49.400
eating expensive stuff.

3528
01:28:49.700 --> 01:28:50.120
So I was like,

3529
01:28:50.120 --> 01:28:50.241
oh,

3530
01:28:50.241 --> 01:28:50.481
they're,

3531
01:28:50.481 --> 01:28:51.470
they're paid workers.

3532
01:28:51.471 --> 01:28:52.680
These guys are interesting.

3533
01:28:52.840 --> 01:28:53.690
They're a rather,

3534
01:28:53.691 --> 01:28:54.080
um,

3535
01:28:54.080 --> 01:28:54.381
you know,

3536
01:28:54.381 --> 01:28:54.710
um,

3537
01:28:54.710 --> 01:28:56.540
a skilled workers rather than just thinking of him.

3538
01:28:56.550 --> 01:28:58.490
A slave possibly brought from all over the world.

3539
01:28:58.491 --> 01:28:59.330
If you're thinking about that,

3540
01:28:59.331 --> 01:29:01.440
because that was a big hub of trade back then too,

3541
01:29:01.441 --> 01:29:01.810
wasn't it?

3542
01:29:01.810 --> 01:29:02.140
I

3543
01:29:02.140 --> 01:29:02.750
<v 1>would,</v>

3544
01:29:02.750 --> 01:29:02.910
I,

3545
01:29:02.910 --> 01:29:04.620
if I would be willing to just,

3546
01:29:05.220 --> 01:29:08.460
how much would you be willing to pay just to go back in time just for,

3547
01:29:08.500 --> 01:29:10.620
let me watch them build it for 20 minutes.

3548
01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:11.880
Just let me watch them.

3549
01:29:13.070 --> 01:29:14.640
<v 4>Oh,</v>

3550
01:29:15.230 --> 01:29:15.760
<v 1>dog.</v>

3551
01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:16.070
Tara.

3552
01:29:16.070 --> 01:29:16.910
Dactyl that's the thing.

3553
01:29:16.911 --> 01:29:17.211
It's like,

3554
01:29:17.211 --> 01:29:18.200
just because people,

3555
01:29:18.201 --> 01:29:20.150
this is the arrogance people have in modern times.

3556
01:29:20.151 --> 01:29:20.451
It's like,

3557
01:29:20.451 --> 01:29:21.170
look,

3558
01:29:21.170 --> 01:29:21.381
you know,

3559
01:29:21.381 --> 01:29:25.040
we knew flat screen TVs were common in the 70s we just didn't have the fucking

3560
01:29:25.041 --> 01:29:25.641
technology,

3561
01:29:25.641 --> 01:29:26.990
but we wanted him really bad.

3562
01:29:27.240 --> 01:29:28.760
So that's kind of the same mentality.

3563
01:29:28.761 --> 01:29:29.361
They have be like,

3564
01:29:29.361 --> 01:29:29.541
look,

3565
01:29:29.541 --> 01:29:32.660
we don't have cranes so we've got to make something in the meanwhile,

3566
01:29:32.810 --> 01:29:33.111
God,

3567
01:29:33.111 --> 01:29:34.370
I would love to have seen it though.

3568
01:29:34.640 --> 01:29:35.630
I believe that.

3569
01:29:35.690 --> 01:29:35.991
I believe.

3570
01:29:35.991 --> 01:29:36.411
I don't,

3571
01:29:36.411 --> 01:29:36.651
you know,

3572
01:29:36.651 --> 01:29:39.050
I at one point in time subscribe to the alien theory,

3573
01:29:39.260 --> 01:29:40.940
but I did it with very little consideration.

3574
01:29:41.120 --> 01:29:44.270
I did it because it was like fucking aliens made that I didn't like sit down and

3575
01:29:44.271 --> 01:29:45.410
really work it through.

3576
01:29:45.860 --> 01:29:48.500
I just fun to say we're fucking smart.

3577
01:29:48.740 --> 01:29:49.370
Well it's,

3578
01:29:49.370 --> 01:29:50.450
it's that we're smart,

3579
01:29:50.570 --> 01:29:54.680
but it's also that we forget shit sometimes and then the people learn some

3580
01:29:54.681 --> 01:29:55.310
pretty,

3581
01:29:55.310 --> 01:29:56.810
pretty deep and impressive stuff.

3582
01:29:56.810 --> 01:29:57.171
And then,

3583
01:29:57.171 --> 01:29:57.770
you know,

3584
01:29:57.770 --> 01:30:00.950
the small group of people that we're concentrating on that died off and other

3585
01:30:00.951 --> 01:30:02.690
people didn't take up the discipline and you know,

3586
01:30:02.691 --> 01:30:03.140
we lose,

3587
01:30:03.140 --> 01:30:04.100
lose touch with things.

3588
01:30:04.101 --> 01:30:04.670
Right.

3589
01:30:04.670 --> 01:30:07.490
It's just amazing to think that they lost touch with a city.

3590
01:30:07.820 --> 01:30:12.020
Like the entire structure was completely abandoned when people found it because

3591
01:30:12.021 --> 01:30:12.230
you know,

3592
01:30:12.230 --> 01:30:13.940
the Sphinx was covered in sand.

3593
01:30:14.230 --> 01:30:14.391
You know,

3594
01:30:14.391 --> 01:30:16.160
like even when the Polian found the spanx,

3595
01:30:16.161 --> 01:30:18.680
it was covered to its neck and saying that was the place was abandoned.

3596
01:30:18.740 --> 01:30:20.960
But it's amazing how like basically like you're saying,

3597
01:30:20.961 --> 01:30:24.350
ignorance can sweep the world to the point where they stopped using that psychic

3598
01:30:24.351 --> 01:30:25.184
guy that that,

3599
01:30:25.740 --> 01:30:30.740
but how bizarre is it that you can actually abandoned a whole area and then an

3600
01:30:32.661 --> 01:30:35.960
area that was literally the peak of civilization.

3601
01:30:35.961 --> 01:30:40.961
At one point everybody moved out and then moved into far inferior shit holes

3602
01:30:41.750 --> 01:30:43.520
that were right down the street like,

3603
01:30:43.521 --> 01:30:46.100
and then they set up shacks and start grilling shitty houses.

3604
01:30:46.100 --> 01:30:46.611
Who knows?

3605
01:30:46.611 --> 01:30:47.180
Man,

3606
01:30:47.180 --> 01:30:47.661
who knows?

3607
01:30:47.661 --> 01:30:51.170
I mean there was a bunch of things that happened was political unrest.

3608
01:30:51.171 --> 01:30:52.970
They were conquered by the New Orleans.

3609
01:30:53.120 --> 01:30:54.860
A lot of things happen to ancient Egypt.

3610
01:30:54.861 --> 01:30:58.010
The fact that they kept it together as long as they did all those pharaoh's one

3611
01:30:58.011 --> 01:30:58.471
after the other.

3612
01:30:58.471 --> 01:30:59.660
They're all building pyramids.

3613
01:30:59.661 --> 01:31:01.640
All building giant fucking Mani.

3614
01:31:01.830 --> 01:31:04.520
The Holy Roman Empire comes together on the other side too.

3615
01:31:04.521 --> 01:31:08.960
And it's like you're talking epic wars with animals and shit that you can't even

3616
01:31:08.961 --> 01:31:09.860
begin to imagine.

3617
01:31:09.861 --> 01:31:11.810
Must've been amazing back then.

3618
01:31:11.811 --> 01:31:13.930
What a fascinating traveling all over,

3619
01:31:14.010 --> 01:31:18.110
bring in spices and shit to trade with bringing dope son.

3620
01:31:18.290 --> 01:31:19.490
I got the funny though.

3621
01:31:19.520 --> 01:31:22.070
If you had to go back and live in that world,

3622
01:31:22.071 --> 01:31:23.240
you would fucking hate it.

3623
01:31:23.270 --> 01:31:24.320
You wouldn't want to kill yourself.

3624
01:31:24.321 --> 01:31:25.370
You wouldn't even want to live.

3625
01:31:25.590 --> 01:31:28.670
But back then they didn't know any better and they just kept on trucking,

3626
01:31:29.850 --> 01:31:30.200
man.

3627
01:31:30.200 --> 01:31:32.390
I just did it and it's like that's like the people who set out to discover

3628
01:31:32.391 --> 01:31:32.691
America.

3629
01:31:32.691 --> 01:31:33.501
It's like this sucks.

3630
01:31:33.501 --> 01:31:36.350
Let's go see what's over there and if and if it's socks so that we're fucked,

3631
01:31:37.310 --> 01:31:38.143
but we'll stay.

3632
01:31:39.140 --> 01:31:40.070
God Damn.

3633
01:31:40.460 --> 01:31:43.160
And we're going to have to probably do that sometime to some shit's going to go

3634
01:31:43.161 --> 01:31:43.491
down.

3635
01:31:43.491 --> 01:31:45.590
Some tsunami going to hit the west coast,

3636
01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:47.900
Peel Malibu out into the middle of the ocean.

3637
01:31:48.170 --> 01:31:52.010
Just giant fucking Johnny Carson's size of states floating out in the middle of

3638
01:31:52.011 --> 01:31:52.730
the ocean.

3639
01:31:52.730 --> 01:31:55.610
But that squad will be up there like red dawn in the mountains.

3640
01:31:55.611 --> 01:31:55.841
Dude,

3641
01:31:55.841 --> 01:31:56.674
we'll be out.

3642
01:31:56.850 --> 01:32:00.340
We'll be up there with fucking canned food and be stuck in Burbank.

3643
01:32:00.450 --> 01:32:00.670
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

3644
01:32:00.670 --> 01:32:01.220
I'll be stuck.

3645
01:32:01.220 --> 01:32:02.580
Browbeating of Hormel out of the hot.

3646
01:32:02.740 --> 01:32:04.090
It'll be hiking is way over here.

3647
01:32:04.110 --> 01:32:04.720
Yeah,

3648
01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:05.710
I'll bring fishing poles.

3649
01:32:06.010 --> 01:32:07.330
So we're going to go fishing for sure.

3650
01:32:07.360 --> 01:32:07.781
Fuck yeah.

3651
01:32:07.781 --> 01:32:10.570
We're going to go to lake state and catch some large mouth bath son.

3652
01:32:10.610 --> 01:32:12.550
Let's do perhaps we'll use rubber worms.

3653
01:32:12.551 --> 01:32:14.120
We don't give a fuck to your hands.

3654
01:32:14.121 --> 01:32:17.620
Do you ever see that shit where they just grabbed their hands and fish cafes?

3655
01:32:18.180 --> 01:32:19.150
They call it noodling.

3656
01:32:19.151 --> 01:32:20.860
For some reason I can't get with that.

3657
01:32:21.070 --> 01:32:22.450
That sounds like the south.

3658
01:32:22.480 --> 01:32:24.460
The South is one of the least appreciated,

3659
01:32:24.510 --> 01:32:24.790
uh,

3660
01:32:24.790 --> 01:32:25.970
forms of entertainment.

3661
01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:26.530
Hell,

3662
01:32:26.530 --> 01:32:27.061
this shit.

3663
01:32:27.061 --> 01:32:29.710
And the people would do it in the south and the efficient for these,

3664
01:32:29.711 --> 01:32:30.880
if you don't know what noodling is,

3665
01:32:30.881 --> 01:32:34.090
they catch giant ass catfish like a hundred pounds.

3666
01:32:34.091 --> 01:32:35.870
I'm a monster office down the hall.

3667
01:32:36.730 --> 01:32:41.140
They stick their hand inside the cap fits his mouth and they Gillam they grab

3668
01:32:41.141 --> 01:32:42.220
them and they pull them out.

3669
01:32:42.280 --> 01:32:42.640
Yeah,

3670
01:32:42.640 --> 01:32:44.050
that's insane,

3671
01:32:44.051 --> 01:32:44.620
man.

3672
01:32:44.620 --> 01:32:48.310
You're letting that giant ass fucking fish bite your arm and you're trying to

3673
01:32:48.460 --> 01:32:49.720
kill it with your bare hands.

3674
01:32:50.110 --> 01:32:52.270
They literally have like a life or death,

3675
01:32:52.330 --> 01:32:55.780
mortal combat battle with a giant fish in the water.

3676
01:32:55.870 --> 01:32:57.990
The one of probably other than a sturgeon,

3677
01:32:58.000 --> 01:32:58.691
a couple of other fish,

3678
01:32:58.691 --> 01:33:00.810
one of the biggest freshwater fishes there.

3679
01:33:00.850 --> 01:33:02.200
They get up to 47 pounds.

3680
01:33:02.370 --> 01:33:03.940
What the biggest bass was what?

3681
01:33:03.941 --> 01:33:05.020
22 and a half pounds.

3682
01:33:05.070 --> 01:33:05.680
Large mouth,

3683
01:33:05.680 --> 01:33:06.820
I think it was like,

3684
01:33:07.020 --> 01:33:07.470
yeah,

3685
01:33:07.470 --> 01:33:08.770
other than a sea bass or something like that.

3686
01:33:08.800 --> 01:33:12.190
You're talking cat fish get to be the size of of medium sized dogs.

3687
01:33:12.480 --> 01:33:14.380
They get even bigger than that man ain't China.

3688
01:33:14.381 --> 01:33:16.840
You ever seen some of the ones that haven't I in Thailand and Vietnam,

3689
01:33:17.250 --> 01:33:18.520
their GI,

3690
01:33:19.510 --> 01:33:19.900
they're like,

3691
01:33:19.900 --> 01:33:21.310
they're basically like sea monsters.

3692
01:33:21.350 --> 01:33:22.090
Lionfish.

3693
01:33:22.090 --> 01:33:22.871
They probably,

3694
01:33:22.871 --> 01:33:23.111
you know,

3695
01:33:23.111 --> 01:33:26.500
responsible for a lot of like depictions of sea monsters from ancient tradition.

3696
01:33:26.710 --> 01:33:27.543
Oh yeah.

3697
01:33:27.790 --> 01:33:29.170
Fucking little dogs and shit.

3698
01:33:29.240 --> 01:33:29.911
Early babies.

3699
01:33:29.911 --> 01:33:30.160
That's,

3700
01:33:30.160 --> 01:33:30.511
that's all.

3701
01:33:30.511 --> 01:33:31.900
I got a baby floating around the water.

3702
01:33:31.901 --> 01:33:34.240
A fucking hundred and 50 pound catfish comes along.

3703
01:33:34.241 --> 01:33:35.074
I'll just eat your baby.

3704
01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:35.650
I'm like,

3705
01:33:35.650 --> 01:33:36.370
you don't think,

3706
01:33:36.370 --> 01:33:40.300
you don't think a baby's been eaten by Cath or sometime in the history of that

3707
01:33:40.301 --> 01:33:40.710
shit.

3708
01:33:40.710 --> 01:33:41.291
It probably has.

3709
01:33:41.291 --> 01:33:42.124
I mean want to see it.

3710
01:33:42.430 --> 01:33:43.420
That would make me feel bad.

3711
01:33:43.620 --> 01:33:43.990
Yeah.

3712
01:33:43.990 --> 01:33:44.171
Yeah.

3713
01:33:44.171 --> 01:33:44.621
So let's go.

3714
01:33:44.621 --> 01:33:45.011
I want to go,

3715
01:33:45.011 --> 01:33:46.930
let's [inaudible] are you in town a while or we're going to go?

3716
01:33:46.990 --> 01:33:47.380
Yeah.

3717
01:33:47.380 --> 01:33:48.970
Well I'm filled with fear factor right now.

3718
01:33:48.980 --> 01:33:49.610
Back to work.

3719
01:33:49.610 --> 01:33:50.351
How is it?

3720
01:33:50.351 --> 01:33:50.801
How's it going?

3721
01:33:50.801 --> 01:33:51.634
Very strange.

3722
01:33:51.750 --> 01:33:52.600
It feels bizarre.

3723
01:33:52.970 --> 01:33:53.651
I can watch.

3724
01:33:53.651 --> 01:33:54.010
Yeah,

3725
01:33:54.010 --> 01:33:54.221
yeah,

3726
01:33:54.221 --> 01:33:54.431
sure.

3727
01:33:54.431 --> 01:33:55.500
And I want to talk to him and watch it.

3728
01:33:55.510 --> 01:33:56.201
It feels like,

3729
01:33:56.201 --> 01:33:56.650
uh,

3730
01:33:56.650 --> 01:33:57.430
like,

3731
01:33:57.430 --> 01:33:58.970
like our Matt Kuehn.

3732
01:33:58.971 --> 01:34:00.220
It's one of the producers said it best.

3733
01:34:00.221 --> 01:34:00.461
She said,

3734
01:34:00.461 --> 01:34:03.880
it feels like we all went into a coma and woke up and just started doing fear

3735
01:34:03.881 --> 01:34:04.540
factor.

3736
01:34:04.540 --> 01:34:07.270
How many times in history has this ever happened where they took a hit show and

3737
01:34:07.271 --> 01:34:08.830
brought it back and it's a hit show of family.

3738
01:34:09.040 --> 01:34:09.851
We don't know if it's a hit show.

3739
01:34:09.851 --> 01:34:10.810
It can be a total flop now.

3740
01:34:10.811 --> 01:34:12.520
And you guys are going to be syndicated the globe over,

3741
01:34:12.521 --> 01:34:16.750
you know that she knows most of your staff return almost everyone.

3742
01:34:16.780 --> 01:34:16.931
Well,

3743
01:34:16.931 --> 01:34:21.640
the beauty of fear factor is that the people behind the scenes are the nicest

3744
01:34:21.641 --> 01:34:22.930
fucking people in the world.

3745
01:34:22.960 --> 01:34:25.390
Everyone is so nice and Rupert the director,

3746
01:34:25.391 --> 01:34:29.080
so great guy and he has all these cameramen who follow him wherever he goes

3747
01:34:29.260 --> 01:34:30.670
because he's a great guy to work for.

3748
01:34:30.671 --> 01:34:31.421
Super Supportive,

3749
01:34:31.421 --> 01:34:32.021
Super Nice,

3750
01:34:32.021 --> 01:34:32.801
just to an end,

3751
01:34:32.801 --> 01:34:33.634
very competent,

3752
01:34:33.800 --> 01:34:37.750
an excellent director for those kind of like action reality shows and he's a

3753
01:34:37.751 --> 01:34:38.650
genius for that Shit.

3754
01:34:38.950 --> 01:34:42.070
And so he has this grand crew and then Matt Kunis does the nicest guy ever.

3755
01:34:42.070 --> 01:34:45.160
He's one of the executive producers and he brings his crew and David Horowitz is

3756
01:34:45.161 --> 01:34:48.340
another one on the nicest fucking people I've ever met and he brings his crew.

3757
01:34:48.490 --> 01:34:53.490
So it's like this giant group of really nice people and almost 80% of them are

3758
01:34:53.831 --> 01:34:55.250
still working for the same guys.

3759
01:34:55.260 --> 01:34:55.461
Oh,

3760
01:34:55.461 --> 01:34:57.440
that's all they brought everybody back together again.

3761
01:34:57.441 --> 01:34:59.630
The same sound guys while the same camera guys.

3762
01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:03.330
I mean it seems bizarre as fuck and that's how people get shit done there.

3763
01:35:03.350 --> 01:35:04.970
That's especially in this town.

3764
01:35:04.971 --> 01:35:05.361
Like I was saying,

3765
01:35:05.361 --> 01:35:06.081
they don't do that.

3766
01:35:06.081 --> 01:35:07.430
They don't just bring a show back.

3767
01:35:07.500 --> 01:35:09.860
So weird like the first day and I'm like,

3768
01:35:09.861 --> 01:35:10.251
you know,

3769
01:35:10.251 --> 01:35:14.060
stare fear in the eye and you're wearing on your way to winning $100,000 while

3770
01:35:14.061 --> 01:35:14.990
I'm saying it and they're cheering,

3771
01:35:14.991 --> 01:35:15.390
I'm going,

3772
01:35:15.390 --> 01:35:15.621
Whoa,

3773
01:35:15.621 --> 01:35:16.700
this doesn't even seem real.

3774
01:35:17.220 --> 01:35:21.140
All the sudden the helicopters are flying overhead and people are fucking dive

3775
01:35:21.141 --> 01:35:23.690
it off these helicopters and it's fucking crazy.

3776
01:35:23.730 --> 01:35:24.563
This man,

3777
01:35:24.920 --> 01:35:27.050
the other one is still globally syndicated.

3778
01:35:27.051 --> 01:35:27.261
Right?

3779
01:35:27.261 --> 01:35:27.591
It's still,

3780
01:35:27.591 --> 01:35:28.250
that's,

3781
01:35:28.250 --> 01:35:29.210
that's what happened.

3782
01:35:29.390 --> 01:35:32.600
What happened was fear factor was on this thing called chiller.

3783
01:35:32.750 --> 01:35:35.900
Chiller is one of NBCS little satellite networks,

3784
01:35:35.901 --> 01:35:39.770
a small network that they have and they played the replays on chiller all the

3785
01:35:39.771 --> 01:35:40.011
time.

3786
01:35:40.011 --> 01:35:43.910
They got killer ratings like way better than any of the other shows on chillers.

3787
01:35:43.911 --> 01:35:44.561
So what,

3788
01:35:44.561 --> 01:35:45.290
what are we going to do?

3789
01:35:45.290 --> 01:35:45.570
You know,

3790
01:35:45.570 --> 01:35:45.861
what's,

3791
01:35:45.861 --> 01:35:46.040
uh,

3792
01:35:46.040 --> 01:35:46.370
what's,

3793
01:35:46.370 --> 01:35:46.730
you know,

3794
01:35:46.730 --> 01:35:47.210
what's,

3795
01:35:47.210 --> 01:35:50.780
they didn't never expected it was going to like even other and other NBC,

3796
01:35:50.830 --> 01:35:51.170
um,

3797
01:35:51.170 --> 01:35:51.501
little,

3798
01:35:51.501 --> 01:35:55.010
the other affiliates which fighting to get the fear factor reruns on their

3799
01:35:55.011 --> 01:35:55.460
network.

3800
01:35:55.460 --> 01:35:56.120
Oh Wow.

3801
01:35:56.120 --> 01:35:57.500
Because it does so good on chiller.

3802
01:35:57.710 --> 01:35:58.910
So then someone,

3803
01:35:58.970 --> 01:35:59.240
uh,

3804
01:35:59.240 --> 01:36:01.220
I guess Matt Kunis goes to NBC and says,

3805
01:36:01.221 --> 01:36:01.491
listen,

3806
01:36:01.491 --> 01:36:03.260
let's fucking bring this pitch back.

3807
01:36:03.261 --> 01:36:03.980
Come on son.

3808
01:36:03.980 --> 01:36:05.180
You know what it was is because the,

3809
01:36:05.181 --> 01:36:09.260
back when you guys were on the air before it was before the shit was real viral

3810
01:36:09.261 --> 01:36:11.000
on the Internet and you thrived.

3811
01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:12.230
But think about now with the Internet,

3812
01:36:12.231 --> 01:36:15.380
cause that kind of is all great for just good scenes.

3813
01:36:15.381 --> 01:36:15.621
Yeah,

3814
01:36:15.621 --> 01:36:15.981
good,

3815
01:36:15.981 --> 01:36:16.311
good.

3816
01:36:16.311 --> 01:36:17.120
Like,

3817
01:36:17.120 --> 01:36:17.421
you know,

3818
01:36:17.421 --> 01:36:17.861
like any,

3819
01:36:17.861 --> 01:36:20.990
any crazy stunt and he crazy wild shit that goes down.

3820
01:36:20.991 --> 01:36:21.260
Yeah,

3821
01:36:21.260 --> 01:36:23.450
that's definitely going to be good fodder for the Internet.

3822
01:36:23.690 --> 01:36:27.150
But it's also that reality shows we're sort of the redheaded stepchild of

3823
01:36:27.160 --> 01:36:28.190
television back then.

3824
01:36:28.280 --> 01:36:29.660
There's so many of them now,

3825
01:36:30.210 --> 01:36:35.120
so many different games shows and I think fear factor and really survivor first

3826
01:36:35.150 --> 01:36:40.150
sort of pave the way for this sort of kind of a crazy extreme game show on

3827
01:36:40.731 --> 01:36:42.650
television survivor of course,

3828
01:36:42.651 --> 01:36:44.060
being much more about,

3829
01:36:44.090 --> 01:36:44.780
you know,

3830
01:36:44.780 --> 01:36:48.410
the people and getting to know them and them living together forever.

3831
01:36:48.470 --> 01:36:49.460
We're working together.

3832
01:36:49.461 --> 01:36:50.041
And then the,

3833
01:36:50.041 --> 01:36:53.420
the fucking psychological aspect of voting each other off and all that shit.

3834
01:36:53.510 --> 01:36:54.290
Any of the stunts.

3835
01:36:54.290 --> 01:36:55.610
Just insane.

3836
01:36:55.630 --> 01:36:56.151
Oh dude,

3837
01:36:56.151 --> 01:36:56.751
there's so nuts.

3838
01:36:56.751 --> 01:36:58.100
I wish I could fucking tell you though.

3839
01:36:58.400 --> 01:36:58.641
There's,

3840
01:36:58.641 --> 01:37:01.510
some of them are so ridiculous that they had this tell me donkeys.

3841
01:37:01.511 --> 01:37:01.910
Semen.

3842
01:37:01.910 --> 01:37:03.410
They had to tell me and I w y.

3843
01:37:03.460 --> 01:37:03.661
Oh,

3844
01:37:03.661 --> 01:37:04.270
ah.

3845
01:37:04.270 --> 01:37:05.103
I've just made that up.

3846
01:37:06.220 --> 01:37:07.040
They had to tell me,

3847
01:37:07.040 --> 01:37:07.400
um,

3848
01:37:07.400 --> 01:37:09.170
they had to tell me the things twice because I was like,

3849
01:37:09.171 --> 01:37:10.100
what are you talking about?

3850
01:37:10.160 --> 01:37:11.060
You tell me this again.

3851
01:37:11.390 --> 01:37:12.240
They're going to do what?

3852
01:37:13.800 --> 01:37:14.370
<v 2>Ridiculous.</v>

3853
01:37:14.370 --> 01:37:15.203
Wait.

3854
01:37:15.580 --> 01:37:16.930
Are you guys going to top yourself?

3855
01:37:16.931 --> 01:37:20.030
I saw people is in eighth grade.

3856
01:37:21.240 --> 01:37:22.500
When I did it used to watch for your factor.

3857
01:37:22.501 --> 01:37:23.740
I'd watch like this all the time.

3858
01:37:24.220 --> 01:37:24.551
I just,

3859
01:37:24.551 --> 01:37:26.440
for some reason I thought I smelled like I would,

3860
01:37:26.470 --> 01:37:27.470
my gag would hit if I,

3861
01:37:27.500 --> 01:37:29.800
I thought it smelled what they're thinking about the HD.

3862
01:37:29.801 --> 01:37:31.920
If they're going deep well that's one of the things they thought about it.

3863
01:37:31.921 --> 01:37:34.030
They've got like a hundred fucking cameras on everything now.

3864
01:37:34.370 --> 01:37:34.730
Yeah.

3865
01:37:34.730 --> 01:37:35.770
They're going to get every angle,

3866
01:37:35.800 --> 01:37:38.980
no bugs bursting and writing I the one episode where you almost beat the dude

3867
01:37:38.981 --> 01:37:39.161
up.

3868
01:37:39.161 --> 01:37:41.140
That was pretty funny because he hits of our sheet.

3869
01:37:41.141 --> 01:37:45.670
He came up and hit somebody whose wife did is somebody that was very sad,

3870
01:37:45.760 --> 01:37:47.610
but it's funny to watch the little dog [inaudible].

3871
01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:49.233
Well,

3872
01:37:49.270 --> 01:37:50.100
when I grabbed him,

3873
01:37:50.100 --> 01:37:50.230
yeah,

3874
01:37:50.230 --> 01:37:50.741
he rolled over.

3875
01:37:50.741 --> 01:37:51.401
I just got hit me,

3876
01:37:51.401 --> 01:37:51.670
man.

3877
01:37:51.670 --> 01:37:51.921
Yeah,

3878
01:37:51.921 --> 01:37:54.220
well it looked like he thought he thought he was going to two and then he

3879
01:37:54.221 --> 01:37:55.620
realized how Adeline he was.

3880
01:37:55.650 --> 01:37:55.951
Well,

3881
01:37:55.951 --> 01:37:56.160
when

3882
01:37:56.160 --> 01:37:57.720
<v 0>someone grabs you a Thai clinch,</v>

3883
01:37:57.750 --> 01:38:00.720
if you don't know what the feeling is like to get caught in what's called the

3884
01:38:00.721 --> 01:38:02.770
plum and then with the Moitai plumbing,

3885
01:38:02.780 --> 01:38:04.080
he grabbed the back of someone's neck.

3886
01:38:04.230 --> 01:38:07.080
You can control the fuck out of someone with that position anywhere.

3887
01:38:07.410 --> 01:38:08.940
That's my Goto Shit.

3888
01:38:08.941 --> 01:38:10.200
If I think of guys trying to hit me,

3889
01:38:10.380 --> 01:38:11.390
I just grabbed the back of us.

3890
01:38:11.410 --> 01:38:11.881
I mean it's not,

3891
01:38:11.881 --> 01:38:14.250
I shouldn't say my code to share cause it's never really happened before,

3892
01:38:14.460 --> 01:38:18.510
but automatically in that spot and no one ever on the show I'd ever gotten in my

3893
01:38:18.511 --> 01:38:20.300
face or screaming in my face before like,

3894
01:38:20.490 --> 01:38:21.001
and this guy,

3895
01:38:21.001 --> 01:38:24.570
we'd been told before that he was dangerous through his wife,

3896
01:38:24.571 --> 01:38:26.910
down on television and assaulted and got on another show.

3897
01:38:27.180 --> 01:38:28.020
So I was like this guys,

3898
01:38:28.021 --> 01:38:29.190
I'm not going to let this dude hit me,

3899
01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:29.970
but you Greg,

3900
01:38:29.970 --> 01:38:31.230
that's the best way to control somebody,

3901
01:38:31.231 --> 01:38:31.440
man.

3902
01:38:31.440 --> 01:38:33.030
Grab a hold their neck like theories that kid.

3903
01:38:33.540 --> 01:38:35.550
Do you remember years ago there were beaten his wife,

3904
01:38:35.551 --> 01:38:38.250
there was some special ops guy who was trying to sniff,

3905
01:38:38.280 --> 01:38:39.510
sniff you out one night.

3906
01:38:39.511 --> 01:38:41.050
Like you're at the comedy store.

3907
01:38:41.110 --> 01:38:43.380
I had a special special ops like army rangers sent me.

3908
01:38:43.381 --> 01:38:44.131
He's a big dude.

3909
01:38:44.131 --> 01:38:45.150
He's about six foot five.

3910
01:38:45.151 --> 01:38:47.610
And you could tell like he was trying to challenge you a little bit.

3911
01:38:47.611 --> 01:38:50.140
Like you were told that that's friends with um,

3912
01:38:50.170 --> 01:38:50.940
what's his film?

3913
01:38:50.940 --> 01:38:53.220
Mike or Somebody who's friends with nick?

3914
01:38:53.221 --> 01:38:53.820
Yusuf.

3915
01:38:53.820 --> 01:38:55.360
Was He friends with talk?

3916
01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:57.260
It was really mean to Brian.

3917
01:38:57.660 --> 01:38:58.493
That's a big ass.

3918
01:38:58.720 --> 01:39:01.170
And then he was trying to sniff around you for a second,

3919
01:39:01.171 --> 01:39:03.650
but then like you did this thing like where you stare at them and they liked,

3920
01:39:03.651 --> 01:39:05.880
there was a stare off at like two dudes sniffing each other.

3921
01:39:05.880 --> 01:39:06.121
I was like,

3922
01:39:06.121 --> 01:39:06.870
oh this.

3923
01:39:06.870 --> 01:39:07.651
And then all of a sudden like,

3924
01:39:07.651 --> 01:39:08.484
he almost like,

3925
01:39:08.640 --> 01:39:10.320
it's like you sent out some mental message.

3926
01:39:10.321 --> 01:39:10.740
He's like,

3927
01:39:10.740 --> 01:39:11.460
I got it.

3928
01:39:11.460 --> 01:39:12.600
But it just stood down.

3929
01:39:12.601 --> 01:39:13.434
It was like I got,

3930
01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:17.010
I understand he was drunk and I was trying to tell him that he was drunk and I

3931
01:39:17.011 --> 01:39:17.780
was trying to tell him,

3932
01:39:17.780 --> 01:39:17.960
uh,

3933
01:39:17.960 --> 01:39:18.270
you know,

3934
01:39:18.270 --> 01:39:19.400
there's no need for me,

3935
01:39:19.401 --> 01:39:20.550
you to be aggressive to me.

3936
01:39:20.580 --> 01:39:21.450
I'm not doing anything to you.

3937
01:39:21.480 --> 01:39:21.960
Right.

3938
01:39:21.960 --> 01:39:22.351
And then,

3939
01:39:22.351 --> 01:39:22.621
you know,

3940
01:39:22.621 --> 01:39:24.450
he was talking about them and see a thing.

3941
01:39:24.451 --> 01:39:27.150
He was giving me a hard time because it was the night of Mitzia,

3942
01:39:27.240 --> 01:39:27.631
you know,

3943
01:39:27.631 --> 01:39:29.580
and he was saying that he grew up in Boston.

3944
01:39:29.581 --> 01:39:30.361
We don't play that way.

3945
01:39:30.361 --> 01:39:31.200
If you want to kick somebody,

3946
01:39:31.520 --> 01:39:32.940
if you fucking don't like somebody,

3947
01:39:32.941 --> 01:39:33.211
you don't,

3948
01:39:33.211 --> 01:39:34.680
you don't just talk about it on stage.

3949
01:39:34.681 --> 01:39:35.850
You kicked a fucking ass.

3950
01:39:36.120 --> 01:39:36.451
And I go,

3951
01:39:36.451 --> 01:39:36.781
really?

3952
01:39:36.781 --> 01:39:37.060
I go,

3953
01:39:37.060 --> 01:39:38.430
you're not allowed to work things out.

3954
01:39:38.820 --> 01:39:39.271
You can't work.

3955
01:39:39.271 --> 01:39:39.990
You can't talk.

3956
01:39:39.990 --> 01:39:40.980
You have to beat each other up.

3957
01:39:41.340 --> 01:39:41.611
He said,

3958
01:39:41.611 --> 01:39:41.711
yeah,

3959
01:39:41.711 --> 01:39:42.120
I go,

3960
01:39:42.120 --> 01:39:43.650
did anybody who thinks like that?

3961
01:39:43.680 --> 01:39:44.041
For sure.

3962
01:39:44.041 --> 01:39:45.330
You haven't been in a lot of fights,

3963
01:39:45.520 --> 01:39:45.720
right?

3964
01:39:45.720 --> 01:39:46.890
Like you haven't been in a lot of fights.

3965
01:39:46.891 --> 01:39:47.790
You don't know how to fight.

3966
01:39:48.090 --> 01:39:49.290
And then he got angry at me.

3967
01:39:49.410 --> 01:39:50.041
He's a good food.

3968
01:39:50.041 --> 01:39:51.330
The fuck do you think you already told me?

3969
01:39:51.331 --> 01:39:52.080
I don't know if I,

3970
01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:52.321
I go,

3971
01:39:52.321 --> 01:39:52.951
if you knew how to fight,

3972
01:39:52.951 --> 01:39:53.761
if had been in a lot of fights,

3973
01:39:53.761 --> 01:39:54.930
you'd know that you get hurt in fights.

3974
01:39:54.960 --> 01:39:56.100
You break your hands and shit.

3975
01:39:56.101 --> 01:39:57.360
Punching people are weakened.

3976
01:39:57.620 --> 01:39:58.260
Yeah.

3977
01:39:58.260 --> 01:39:59.310
And you go to jail,

3978
01:39:59.311 --> 01:39:59.640
you get,

3979
01:39:59.640 --> 01:40:00.720
you get arrested.

3980
01:40:00.721 --> 01:40:00.961
You know,

3981
01:40:00.961 --> 01:40:01.171
I go,

3982
01:40:01.171 --> 01:40:02.160
it ain't that easy dude.

3983
01:40:02.180 --> 01:40:02.340
It's,

3984
01:40:02.340 --> 01:40:03.031
it's illegal.

3985
01:40:03.031 --> 01:40:03.601
And by the way,

3986
01:40:03.601 --> 01:40:04.560
you kick someone's ass.

3987
01:40:04.740 --> 01:40:05.461
They don't like that.

3988
01:40:05.461 --> 01:40:05.941
So what do they do?

3989
01:40:05.941 --> 01:40:09.270
They come back with a bat or they shoot you when you're not looking and cut your

3990
01:40:09.271 --> 01:40:10.800
tires every day for the rest of your life.

3991
01:40:11.110 --> 01:40:11.310
You know,

3992
01:40:11.310 --> 01:40:12.870
people don't just like getting their ass kicked,

3993
01:40:12.871 --> 01:40:12.981
man.

3994
01:40:12.981 --> 01:40:14.640
And you're living in some crazy boondock saints,

3995
01:40:14.641 --> 01:40:15.241
fake world.

3996
01:40:15.241 --> 01:40:17.160
We just get away with shit and move on to the next scene.

3997
01:40:17.190 --> 01:40:17.730
Exactly.

3998
01:40:17.730 --> 01:40:18.091
You know,

3999
01:40:18.091 --> 01:40:19.100
and so I said that to him.

4000
01:40:19.110 --> 01:40:19.440
I was like,

4001
01:40:19.440 --> 01:40:20.940
you just to fucking chill out man.

4002
01:40:20.941 --> 01:40:21.450
Leave me alone.

4003
01:40:21.450 --> 01:40:22.330
I'm not fucking with you.

4004
01:40:22.350 --> 01:40:23.101
Don't fuck with me.

4005
01:40:23.101 --> 01:40:23.700
And then he,

4006
01:40:23.700 --> 01:40:26.730
he backed away but then he came again and then he keep Brian a hard time.

4007
01:40:26.731 --> 01:40:28.250
It's like intimidating again,

4008
01:40:28.251 --> 01:40:31.380
but it's like that second time he came again like you like gave him this look

4009
01:40:31.381 --> 01:40:34.260
like that look you get when two dudes are about to throw down and even in the

4010
01:40:34.261 --> 01:40:35.094
way off,

4011
01:40:35.280 --> 01:40:36.020
you know like that.

4012
01:40:36.020 --> 01:40:36.570
Yeah.

4013
01:40:36.570 --> 01:40:38.220
Like you gave him this look that like,

4014
01:40:38.221 --> 01:40:39.780
it was almost like Michael j,

4015
01:40:39.781 --> 01:40:43.030
Fox and teen wolf and he was like a keg of beer and his red,

4016
01:40:43.110 --> 01:40:43.861
his eyes turned red.

4017
01:40:43.861 --> 01:40:44.161
I was like,

4018
01:40:44.161 --> 01:40:44.251
well,

4019
01:40:44.251 --> 01:40:45.720
cause the guy picked up on it was like,

4020
01:40:45.780 --> 01:40:46.380
oh,

4021
01:40:46.380 --> 01:40:46.920
I get it.

4022
01:40:46.920 --> 01:40:50.180
Well here's his drunk and stupid and foolish and poured Nick Usif.

4023
01:40:50.190 --> 01:40:50.311
You know,

4024
01:40:50.311 --> 01:40:51.144
it was a good dude.

4025
01:40:51.230 --> 01:40:52.920
Good Buddy got around them.

4026
01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:53.741
But any of those.

4027
01:40:53.741 --> 01:40:54.010
I'm

4028
01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:55.300
<v 1>from Boston guys.</v>

4029
01:40:55.301 --> 01:40:56.470
You know I'm from Chicago.

4030
01:40:56.471 --> 01:40:57.470
We don't fucking play that way.

4031
01:40:57.540 --> 01:40:58.660
That's just come from everywhere.

4032
01:40:58.690 --> 01:41:00.310
But whatever dickless thing to say.

4033
01:41:01.570 --> 01:41:02.530
Higher Standard.

4034
01:41:03.400 --> 01:41:07.810
You're threatening me with your geographic location of bad asses from De Moines.

4035
01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:09.460
I don't care what the fuck a lot of them,

4036
01:41:09.461 --> 01:41:10.030
by the way.

4037
01:41:10.030 --> 01:41:11.480
Wrestling Shit to do out there.

4038
01:41:12.070 --> 01:41:13.910
Pick each other up and throw each other on their heads.

4039
01:41:14.070 --> 01:41:14.910
Bad Ass motherfucker.

4040
01:41:14.950 --> 01:41:17.380
The last thing you want to do is wrestle some dude who lives in the middle of

4041
01:41:17.381 --> 01:41:17.800
nowhere.

4042
01:41:17.800 --> 01:41:18.430
Yeah.

4043
01:41:18.430 --> 01:41:22.300
That's why the Iowa Hawkeyes especially if they have brothers like those Matt

4044
01:41:22.300 --> 01:41:23.140
Hughes type characters.

4045
01:41:23.290 --> 01:41:26.680
You don't want a dude with a brother who lives in the middle of nowhere where

4046
01:41:26.681 --> 01:41:31.000
they're both athletically like superior DNA and they're beating the shit out of

4047
01:41:31.001 --> 01:41:34.880
each other all day and your dad's scheduling fights to fight your brother Jesus.

4048
01:41:35.440 --> 01:41:35.690
Well,

4049
01:41:35.690 --> 01:41:37.390
you boys need to work it out to Europe together.

4050
01:41:37.610 --> 01:41:39.410
We're going out on your own movie with Stephen.

4051
01:41:40.630 --> 01:41:43.240
See that movie with Stephen Dorff where he goes to prison for shooting a guy or

4052
01:41:43.241 --> 01:41:47.170
something like that who broke into his house like it shows how he has to adapt

4053
01:41:47.171 --> 01:41:48.850
to the prison lifestyle because they make you fight.

4054
01:41:49.030 --> 01:41:51.070
Come on Stephen Dorff fights in prison.

4055
01:41:51.850 --> 01:41:53.950
He gets beat up the DVD type shit.

4056
01:41:53.980 --> 01:41:54.161
Nah,

4057
01:41:54.161 --> 01:41:54.820
home boy.

4058
01:41:54.820 --> 01:41:55.271
This was a,

4059
01:41:55.271 --> 01:41:56.081
this was a hit movie.

4060
01:41:56.081 --> 01:41:56.791
Come on sign.

4061
01:41:56.791 --> 01:41:59.140
And do I ever come incorrect with movies?

4062
01:41:59.170 --> 01:42:02.050
What happened to Cuba Gooding jr he should have never happened.

4063
01:42:02.051 --> 01:42:03.040
That's what happens is some,

4064
01:42:03.041 --> 01:42:04.240
some dude's just disappear,

4065
01:42:04.241 --> 01:42:04.511
man.

4066
01:42:04.511 --> 01:42:05.350
I was Stephen Dorff.

4067
01:42:05.351 --> 01:42:06.490
I would say that's one of 'em too.

4068
01:42:06.491 --> 01:42:06.900
He was,

4069
01:42:06.900 --> 01:42:08.080
he was in Goddamn blade.

4070
01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:09.713
Um,

4071
01:42:09.760 --> 01:42:10.250
he's still around.

4072
01:42:10.250 --> 01:42:10.850
He's still around.

4073
01:42:10.850 --> 01:42:11.810
He's still around.

4074
01:42:11.820 --> 01:42:14.920
He's about to race that new movie with Christina Ricci.

4075
01:42:15.490 --> 01:42:15.880
Oh,

4076
01:42:15.880 --> 01:42:16.713
he is?

4077
01:42:17.290 --> 01:42:20.800
He's got a bit of an accent it up before in the bathroom and Jeremy Hood,

4078
01:42:22.060 --> 01:42:22.780
who's bigger time?

4079
01:42:22.780 --> 01:42:24.010
I would like to sit down and watch that.

4080
01:42:24.300 --> 01:42:25.120
Oh yeah.

4081
01:42:25.120 --> 01:42:25.601
I'd be like,

4082
01:42:25.601 --> 01:42:25.691
well,

4083
01:42:25.691 --> 01:42:26.451
he's kinda point man.

4084
01:42:26.451 --> 01:42:26.951
That's got to put no,

4085
01:42:26.951 --> 01:42:27.041
no,

4086
01:42:27.041 --> 01:42:27.111
no,

4087
01:42:27.111 --> 01:42:27.191
no,

4088
01:42:27.191 --> 01:42:27.480
he's,

4089
01:42:27.480 --> 01:42:28.313
he's right too.

4090
01:42:28.680 --> 01:42:28.980
Yeah,

4091
01:42:28.980 --> 01:42:30.190
you would because you'd be like,

4092
01:42:30.191 --> 01:42:32.170
you'd like to see them both kicked the shit out of you to help.

4093
01:42:32.171 --> 01:42:35.530
Max Kellerman sits down on HBO and he has two boxers sit down next to each other

4094
01:42:35.531 --> 01:42:36.850
and he interviews them and he has,

4095
01:42:36.851 --> 01:42:38.800
I'm talking face each other about what they're going to do.

4096
01:42:39.220 --> 01:42:40.150
I would like to do that with him.

4097
01:42:40.780 --> 01:42:42.460
That'd be fun there.

4098
01:42:42.461 --> 01:42:42.830
Take me,

4099
01:42:42.830 --> 01:42:43.970
take me to fear factor.

4100
01:42:43.971 --> 01:42:45.680
I take me to UFC again or you have UFC match.

4101
01:42:45.681 --> 01:42:45.921
Mashable.

4102
01:42:45.921 --> 01:42:46.541
You anytime,

4103
01:42:46.541 --> 01:42:46.960
dude.

4104
01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:47.640
Anytime.

4105
01:42:47.640 --> 01:42:49.270
Because I want to get into that gets people.

4106
01:42:49.271 --> 01:42:49.810
All My,

4107
01:42:49.810 --> 01:42:52.750
a lot of my listeners are now asking me why don't want to ever talk about it.

4108
01:42:52.751 --> 01:42:53.351
It's like I said earlier,

4109
01:42:53.351 --> 01:42:54.220
I won't talk about something.

4110
01:42:54.220 --> 01:42:57.280
I can't talk about it intelligently and it's like I'm just now new to it.

4111
01:42:57.281 --> 01:42:58.620
I could talk about boxing and tell it.

4112
01:42:58.621 --> 01:42:59.500
Eat up a lot of your time,

4113
01:42:59.501 --> 01:42:59.681
man.

4114
01:42:59.681 --> 01:43:00.820
There's a lot of fights to watch.

4115
01:43:00.990 --> 01:43:02.410
I'll watch the kids to learn.

4116
01:43:02.411 --> 01:43:02.861
It's like I,

4117
01:43:02.861 --> 01:43:03.281
you know,

4118
01:43:03.281 --> 01:43:04.900
I know fade or million echo is,

4119
01:43:04.930 --> 01:43:06.030
you know that guy we,

4120
01:43:06.270 --> 01:43:07.060
that's right.

4121
01:43:07.060 --> 01:43:08.620
Dan Henderson knocked him out last night.

4122
01:43:08.700 --> 01:43:11.860
I was hearing about this then I saw what you were tweeting and my buddy Scotty,

4123
01:43:11.900 --> 01:43:15.060
he was saying something about a bad call was well look,

4124
01:43:15.080 --> 01:43:18.310
like from one angle it looked like it could have been a little premature,

4125
01:43:18.490 --> 01:43:20.380
but then from the final angle they showed it.

4126
01:43:20.381 --> 01:43:21.460
I completely agreed with it.

4127
01:43:21.461 --> 01:43:21.970
He went,

4128
01:43:21.970 --> 01:43:22.661
he flat lined,

4129
01:43:22.661 --> 01:43:23.290
he went out,

4130
01:43:23.290 --> 01:43:24.160
he got back up.

4131
01:43:24.290 --> 01:43:25.900
He'll keep what even got woken up.

4132
01:43:25.901 --> 01:43:29.710
Maybe you know like he like he was out for like a split second it looked like

4133
01:43:29.711 --> 01:43:30.370
and then you know,

4134
01:43:30.370 --> 01:43:32.380
sometimes people say that a punch can wake you up,

4135
01:43:32.381 --> 01:43:34.660
but I don't think that that makes a lot of logical sense.

4136
01:43:35.050 --> 01:43:36.550
But people do swear by it,

4137
01:43:36.551 --> 01:43:40.330
but I think it's just that you get hit as your body's kind of rebooting itself.

4138
01:43:40.331 --> 01:43:41.590
It probably will happen at the same time.

4139
01:43:41.591 --> 01:43:46.270
So it probably looks like this is my amateur neurology point of view.

4140
01:43:46.660 --> 01:43:50.110
But point is he got blasted Dan Henderson fucking put a whooping on him.

4141
01:43:50.111 --> 01:43:51.320
That's just no if,

4142
01:43:51.321 --> 01:43:52.250
ands or buts about

4143
01:43:52.250 --> 01:43:52.310
<v 0>it.</v>

4144
01:43:52.310 --> 01:43:53.660
It was all wild,

4145
01:43:53.750 --> 01:43:55.190
like minute and a half I think.

4146
01:43:55.191 --> 01:43:55.881
Throw down,

4147
01:43:55.881 --> 01:43:58.400
they would just swing in leather and Dan had,

4148
01:43:58.430 --> 01:44:02.150
they went to the ground and Dan Henderson hit this sweet wrestling reversal on

4149
01:44:02.151 --> 01:44:04.760
him where he was underneath him in half guard reaches up,

4150
01:44:04.761 --> 01:44:08.990
grabs a leg and ducks under and comes out the back door and just blast him with

4151
01:44:08.991 --> 01:44:11.840
an uppercut right in the jaw and fade or face plants,

4152
01:44:11.841 --> 01:44:12.381
bonk,

4153
01:44:12.381 --> 01:44:16.580
flatlines arms out and then Henderson blasts and twice in the back of the head,

4154
01:44:16.730 --> 01:44:17.750
I can like the side,

4155
01:44:17.980 --> 01:44:18.920
I don't know if it was illegal,

4156
01:44:18.921 --> 01:44:19.101
look,

4157
01:44:19.101 --> 01:44:20.240
look legal to me it was,

4158
01:44:20.241 --> 01:44:21.440
it was borderline though.

4159
01:44:21.441 --> 01:44:21.860
Anyway,

4160
01:44:21.860 --> 01:44:22.461
whatever it is,

4161
01:44:22.461 --> 01:44:23.211
he was done.

4162
01:44:23.211 --> 01:44:23.600
Anyway,

4163
01:44:23.600 --> 01:44:24.590
Henderson's winning this fight,

4164
01:44:24.710 --> 01:44:28.700
he's blasting him and then they stopped the fight and then fado rolls over and

4165
01:44:28.701 --> 01:44:30.140
everybody was like premature stoppage.

4166
01:44:30.260 --> 01:44:31.910
And from one angle I agreed with it.

4167
01:44:31.910 --> 01:44:32.150
I said,

4168
01:44:32.150 --> 01:44:32.450
hmm,

4169
01:44:32.450 --> 01:44:33.470
that might be premature.

4170
01:44:33.590 --> 01:44:34.910
But then from the last angle,

4171
01:44:34.911 --> 01:44:36.740
I looked at it from where herb dean could see it,

4172
01:44:37.010 --> 01:44:38.210
the referee and his,

4173
01:44:38.211 --> 01:44:38.870
he's out,

4174
01:44:38.870 --> 01:44:39.441
he's out,

4175
01:44:39.441 --> 01:44:42.680
he got nailed and then you see them face plant and he's out.

4176
01:44:43.110 --> 01:44:46.430
He hits him again and he hits him again and herb dean steps in and then he rolls

4177
01:44:46.431 --> 01:44:46.970
over.

4178
01:44:46.970 --> 01:44:49.790
So it looks like you have let him recover.

4179
01:44:49.791 --> 01:44:50.900
But he wasn't recovering.

4180
01:44:50.920 --> 01:44:51.200
I don't,

4181
01:44:51.200 --> 01:44:53.840
I think it was ultimately probably a good call,

4182
01:44:53.870 --> 01:44:54.703
but it's,

4183
01:44:54.740 --> 01:44:55.041
it's,

4184
01:44:55.041 --> 01:44:58.580
he's got to err on the side of caution when he sees a guy flatline like that and

4185
01:44:58.581 --> 01:45:00.320
he has to assume that guy's not going to recover.

4186
01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:03.950
Especially when a guy like Dan fucking Henderson is dropping hammers on your

4187
01:45:03.951 --> 01:45:04.690
head.

4188
01:45:04.690 --> 01:45:05.523
<v 2>You know,</v>

4189
01:45:05.600 --> 01:45:06.401
I say when you get hit,

4190
01:45:06.401 --> 01:45:07.270
especially in this side of it,

4191
01:45:07.271 --> 01:45:07.710
and then your,

4192
01:45:07.710 --> 01:45:10.000
your brain just bounces against your brain pan.

4193
01:45:10.001 --> 01:45:10.341
It's like,

4194
01:45:10.341 --> 01:45:11.740
it's not good to get hit anywhere in the head

4195
01:45:12.440 --> 01:45:12.951
<v 0>one spot.</v>

4196
01:45:12.951 --> 01:45:13.491
That's awesome.

4197
01:45:13.491 --> 01:45:13.640
Like,

4198
01:45:13.640 --> 01:45:13.821
Ooh,

4199
01:45:13.821 --> 01:45:14.601
hit me here please,

4200
01:45:14.601 --> 01:45:15.350
please.

4201
01:45:15.350 --> 01:45:16.550
I mean if you want to get hit anywhere,

4202
01:45:16.551 --> 01:45:17.480
I would say the forehead,

4203
01:45:17.600 --> 01:45:19.550
but the forehead can really fuck with your equilibrium.

4204
01:45:19.690 --> 01:45:20.523
Your mobile boom.

4205
01:45:21.800 --> 01:45:22.041
No,

4206
01:45:22.041 --> 01:45:23.150
it makes your balance go.

4207
01:45:23.170 --> 01:45:23.450
Yeah.

4208
01:45:23.450 --> 01:45:26.960
So does the temple temple flux with the equilibrium or as like a shot to the

4209
01:45:26.961 --> 01:45:27.351
jaw,

4210
01:45:27.351 --> 01:45:28.730
just like shuts everything off.

4211
01:45:30.140 --> 01:45:33.020
Just shuts the machinery off and the Lego shots

4212
01:45:33.220 --> 01:45:33.611
<v 2>mouth.</v>

4213
01:45:33.611 --> 01:45:34.444
Not y'all.

4214
01:45:34.610 --> 01:45:35.140
I got,

4215
01:45:35.140 --> 01:45:35.831
I got knocked off.

4216
01:45:35.831 --> 01:45:36.700
I got hit one time,

4217
01:45:36.730 --> 01:45:38.740
hit in the head and then I got hit.

4218
01:45:38.800 --> 01:45:41.470
I hit a bumper of a car that I hit the street,

4219
01:45:41.500 --> 01:45:41.860
Danielle.

4220
01:45:41.860 --> 01:45:45.310
Then my mans and them scooped me up after they all came to cause some bad ass

4221
01:45:45.311 --> 01:45:46.810
marine came out and challenged all of us.

4222
01:45:46.811 --> 01:45:47.650
We just kicked ass.

4223
01:45:47.651 --> 01:45:49.480
We thought we did and some older dude,

4224
01:45:49.481 --> 01:45:50.770
we were just a bunch of high school kids.

4225
01:45:50.771 --> 01:45:54.130
We kicked this dude's ass and that due to some older dude marine came out in,

4226
01:45:54.150 --> 01:45:56.260
in systematically kicked all of our assets.

4227
01:45:56.320 --> 01:45:56.891
That's what I mean.

4228
01:45:56.891 --> 01:45:57.724
You get hit by a car.

4229
01:45:58.180 --> 01:46:01.060
I know he hit me in the head and I hit the bumper of a car.

4230
01:46:01.090 --> 01:46:01.770
I just thought,

4231
01:46:01.770 --> 01:46:02.390
wow,

4232
01:46:02.390 --> 01:46:04.720
if the bumper of a car and hit the pavement and I guys scooped me up,

4233
01:46:04.721 --> 01:46:05.530
I never felt it.

4234
01:46:05.530 --> 01:46:06.430
I just went out lights.

4235
01:46:06.580 --> 01:46:07.210
Wow.

4236
01:46:07.210 --> 01:46:07.841
Keep shouting me.

4237
01:46:07.841 --> 01:46:10.370
But I almost glad he did because if I would've saw that thing coming up,

4238
01:46:10.420 --> 01:46:11.350
I still couldn't have done it.

4239
01:46:11.520 --> 01:46:13.530
<v 3>I thought it was gonna get my ass kicked the other day with you.</v>

4240
01:46:13.531 --> 01:46:18.150
Like there was just some guy screaming at pass in Pasadena like after a comedy

4241
01:46:18.151 --> 01:46:21.700
show after Joe Show and he was screaming for a tax or doing something nice.

4242
01:46:21.770 --> 01:46:25.290
So I went around the corner and started recording and with my camera and he goes

4243
01:46:25.291 --> 01:46:26.580
right in my face cause yo yo yo.

4244
01:46:27.040 --> 01:46:29.610
And I thought he was like going to hit me and I'm like I hate,

4245
01:46:29.620 --> 01:46:30.453
I don't see you later.

4246
01:46:30.630 --> 01:46:31.560
And then suddenly he's like,

4247
01:46:31.561 --> 01:46:31.711
no,

4248
01:46:31.711 --> 01:46:31.850
no,

4249
01:46:31.850 --> 01:46:32.130
no,

4250
01:46:32.130 --> 01:46:32.551
you come here,

4251
01:46:32.551 --> 01:46:33.000
you come here.

4252
01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:36.210
And then he looks up and there's like everybody from the comedy club was

4253
01:46:36.211 --> 01:46:36.751
watching.

4254
01:46:36.751 --> 01:46:40.410
So it was like 30 people in this alley all staring at him and he looks up like

4255
01:46:40.411 --> 01:46:41.131
he was going to like,

4256
01:46:41.131 --> 01:46:41.550
you know,

4257
01:46:41.550 --> 01:46:42.361
do something to me.

4258
01:46:42.361 --> 01:46:44.640
And then he looks up and sees like 30 people staring,

4259
01:46:44.641 --> 01:46:45.380
watching the whole,

4260
01:46:45.380 --> 01:46:47.390
<v 0>we were just walking towards it.</v>

4261
01:46:47.391 --> 01:46:47.790
Yeah.

4262
01:46:47.790 --> 01:46:49.290
We were walking towards you because you,

4263
01:46:49.291 --> 01:46:51.330
you got ahead of us because we heard the screams.

4264
01:46:51.510 --> 01:46:51.600
Oh,

4265
01:46:51.600 --> 01:46:52.320
so we're all set.

4266
01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:55.470
We're all hanging out after the show or we hear the screaming at the Ice House.

4267
01:46:55.590 --> 01:46:57.990
We hear the screaming on the street like we think like maybe there's a fight

4268
01:46:57.991 --> 01:46:58.800
going on or something.

4269
01:46:58.800 --> 01:46:59.790
So we start walking.

4270
01:46:59.791 --> 01:47:01.590
Brian starts running and he runs with the camera,

4271
01:47:01.591 --> 01:47:03.180
but we're all walking behind him.

4272
01:47:03.390 --> 01:47:05.700
And then this guy got like super douchey with Brian.

4273
01:47:05.701 --> 01:47:07.320
Like I didn't know where like was like,

4274
01:47:07.321 --> 01:47:07.471
no,

4275
01:47:07.471 --> 01:47:07.590
no,

4276
01:47:07.590 --> 01:47:08.423
you're not going anywhere.

4277
01:47:08.520 --> 01:47:11.670
And then he turns and saw all of us walking towards it and there's like 20 or 30

4278
01:47:11.671 --> 01:47:12.031
people.

4279
01:47:12.031 --> 01:47:12.301
It was,

4280
01:47:12.301 --> 01:47:13.240
the grade is like,

4281
01:47:13.310 --> 01:47:16.100
I like the word that's come back.

4282
01:47:16.110 --> 01:47:18.150
Oh yeah.

4283
01:47:18.151 --> 01:47:18.631
You don't want to,

4284
01:47:18.631 --> 01:47:18.901
you know,

4285
01:47:18.901 --> 01:47:19.111
see,

4286
01:47:19.111 --> 01:47:20.820
I have 30 people walking away going,

4287
01:47:20.821 --> 01:47:21.240
Oh really?

4288
01:47:21.240 --> 01:47:21.700
Dick?

4289
01:47:21.700 --> 01:47:21.991
Yeah,

4290
01:47:21.991 --> 01:47:22.250
right.

4291
01:47:22.250 --> 01:47:22.510
Shows,

4292
01:47:22.510 --> 01:47:25.080
clank and bottles together quickly.

4293
01:47:25.260 --> 01:47:28.470
He was one of those guys that was super eager to meet me before the show started

4294
01:47:28.471 --> 01:47:29.040
to,

4295
01:47:29.040 --> 01:47:31.950
there's certain guys that just have this weird maniacal and need to shake your

4296
01:47:31.951 --> 01:47:32.310
hand.

4297
01:47:32.310 --> 01:47:32.581
It's not,

4298
01:47:32.581 --> 01:47:33.990
even though he came to the show,

4299
01:47:34.050 --> 01:47:35.550
he was the guy he was,

4300
01:47:35.551 --> 01:47:37.320
he was nutty before the show even started.

4301
01:47:37.710 --> 01:47:39.420
It was nutty and certain dudes of just,

4302
01:47:39.421 --> 01:47:39.721

4305
01:47:40.741 --> 01:47:42.120

4306
01:47:42.121 --> 01:47:42.960

Some people just take your hand or like,

4309
01:47:44.900 --> 01:47:45.750
I just want to touch your soul.

4310
01:47:45.810 --> 01:47:50.690
I want to take so right next to you and then now you're like the DJ.

4311
01:47:50.691 --> 01:47:51.061
I talk,

4312
01:47:51.061 --> 01:47:51.310

4313
01:47:51.310 --> 01:47:51.440
Yeah.

4314
01:47:51.440 --> 01:47:52.081
I got the script.

4315
01:47:52.081 --> 01:47:52.914
I'd love you to read.

4316
01:47:53.270 --> 01:47:54.103
Read my script.

4317
01:47:54.510 --> 01:47:57.240
There's a lot of people that just think they need to meet you and then once they

4318
01:47:57.241 --> 01:47:57.750
meet you,

4319
01:47:57.750 --> 01:48:00.140
they're going to get the script through and then all of a sudden they're going

4320
01:48:00.141 --> 01:48:01.050
to be boondock saints.

4321
01:48:01.080 --> 01:48:01.500
Yeah.

4322
01:48:01.500 --> 01:48:01.980
Yeah.

4323
01:48:01.980 --> 01:48:04.660
Especially it's on because it's like I'm the only guy who knows about you,

4324
01:48:04.661 --> 01:48:04.950
John.

4325
01:48:04.950 --> 01:48:06.150
How many do you have guys?

4326
01:48:06.151 --> 01:48:06.520
That wouldn't,

4327
01:48:06.520 --> 01:48:08.550
especially when you were on a Frank Kelly endo show,

4328
01:48:08.730 --> 01:48:12.120
did you have a guys that were coming to you with sit-com ideas and all kinds of

4329
01:48:12.121 --> 01:48:12.630
shit like that?

4330
01:48:12.630 --> 01:48:12.751
Well,

4331
01:48:12.751 --> 01:48:15.150
the worst is when people who aren't even in the business what?

4332
01:48:15.151 --> 01:48:15.901
Submit new ideas.

4333
01:48:15.901 --> 01:48:16.021
Hey,

4334
01:48:16.021 --> 01:48:16.980
I think I got an idea.

4335
01:48:16.981 --> 01:48:18.150
You don't work in the shop.

4336
01:48:18.151 --> 01:48:19.860
Why are you tying to talk shop to me?

4337
01:48:20.120 --> 01:48:20.230
Hey,

4338
01:48:20.230 --> 01:48:21.063
I'll run this by you.

4339
01:48:21.080 --> 01:48:21.280
Hey,

4340
01:48:21.280 --> 01:48:22.300
you should use this and your back.

4341
01:48:22.320 --> 01:48:23.520
You should shut the fuck up.

4342
01:48:24.180 --> 01:48:25.110
I had a friend that goes,

4343
01:48:25.350 --> 01:48:28.290
I would like to have you listened to my ideas,

4344
01:48:29.010 --> 01:48:31.890
but I'm going to need you to sign some paperwork first.

4345
01:48:32.710 --> 01:48:34.710
He actually said this cause his fucking idea.

4346
01:48:34.711 --> 01:48:35.221
I'm telling you,

4347
01:48:35.221 --> 01:48:36.050
it's not that they don't trust you.

4348
01:48:36.050 --> 01:48:37.470
It's because these ideas are so good.

4349
01:48:37.710 --> 01:48:38.550
Oh my God.

4350
01:48:38.551 --> 01:48:38.761
I go,

4351
01:48:38.761 --> 01:48:39.090
dude,

4352
01:48:39.090 --> 01:48:41.340
you can't pay me enough to listen to your fucking,

4353
01:48:42.060 --> 01:48:43.140
what are you talking about?

4354
01:48:43.200 --> 01:48:43.410
Oh,

4355
01:48:43.410 --> 01:48:44.700
I'm going to go sign paperwork with you.

4356
01:48:44.701 --> 01:48:45.480
You crackpot.

4357
01:48:45.480 --> 01:48:45.691
Go,

4358
01:48:45.691 --> 01:48:46.501
go do your thing,

4359
01:48:46.501 --> 01:48:46.720
man.

4360
01:48:46.720 --> 01:48:48.570
Can do patent work done.

4361
01:48:48.571 --> 01:48:49.350
Sign that shit.

4362
01:48:49.350 --> 01:48:50.340
Have your new soap.

4363
01:48:50.341 --> 01:48:51.060
Fix the world.

4364
01:48:51.060 --> 01:48:51.870
Fucking idiot.

4365
01:48:51.870 --> 01:48:52.920
Crazy assholes.

4366
01:48:53.400 --> 01:48:53.790
But that's,

4367
01:48:53.790 --> 01:48:54.271
that's this.

4368
01:48:54.271 --> 01:48:57.780
This part of the world is like people think that they're going to hit this one

4369
01:48:57.781 --> 01:48:59.040
thing and boom,

4370
01:48:59.041 --> 01:49:00.090
that's going to change everything.

4371
01:49:00.300 --> 01:49:02.100
This is happy when instead of grinding,

4372
01:49:02.190 --> 01:49:02.370
yeah,

4373
01:49:02.370 --> 01:49:03.720
no one down here knows how to get that.

4374
01:49:06.090 --> 01:49:09.660
Everybody wants the haymaker the fuck down and lands from kicking off the fence.

4375
01:49:09.661 --> 01:49:10.650
And the one punch knockout.

4376
01:49:11.090 --> 01:49:11.730
No,

4377
01:49:11.730 --> 01:49:13.570
the grind is where the beauty is should,

4378
01:49:13.930 --> 01:49:15.930
that's where the fucking human spirit has shown.

4379
01:49:15.960 --> 01:49:19.650
He's slowly pieced together a mother fucking empire.

4380
01:49:22.350 --> 01:49:23.700
Lockhart's speaking to empire,

4381
01:49:23.701 --> 01:49:27.150
where can all these fine folks see the Great Freddie Lockhart perform?

4382
01:49:27.300 --> 01:49:27.600
Uh,

4383
01:49:27.600 --> 01:49:28.500

4385
01:49:31.050 --> 01:49:32.390

01:49:34.051 --> 01:49:34.711
That's my new product.

4389
01:49:34.711 --> 01:49:35.520
What does it say it again,

4390
01:49:35.520 --> 01:49:35.740
Mike?

4391
01:49:35.740 --> 01:49:36.401
Talking token.

4392
01:49:36.401 --> 01:49:37.720
He taught them and tow.

4393
01:49:38.460 --> 01:49:38.731
Okay.

4394
01:49:38.731 --> 01:49:41.070
Explain it to my new sponsor on my show.

4395
01:49:41.071 --> 01:49:41.520
Scotty.

4396
01:49:41.520 --> 01:49:41.821
Gee,

4397
01:49:41.821 --> 01:49:45.390
my good guy who got me turned onto the weed and good music and good times,

4398
01:49:45.720 --> 01:49:46.080
uh,

4399
01:49:46.080 --> 01:49:48.160
invented the talk and talk and it's great for anybody wants to get high.

4400
01:49:48.161 --> 01:49:48.780
It's a sponsor,

4401
01:49:48.780 --> 01:49:49.150
my show.

4402
01:49:49.150 --> 01:49:51.160
I won't talk about it too much since you got your own sponsors,

4403
01:49:51.161 --> 01:49:52.150
but that's going to talk about it.

4404
01:49:52.151 --> 01:49:52.840
Go ahead man.

4405
01:49:52.840 --> 01:49:54.430
Go to [inaudible] dot com and what it is,

4406
01:49:54.431 --> 01:49:55.021
it's like a hook,

4407
01:49:55.021 --> 01:49:56.440
a hose at the bottom of it.

4408
01:49:56.441 --> 01:49:59.290
It's a bowl and you can put it in your mouth while you probably didn't smoke it.

4409
01:49:59.291 --> 01:50:02.320
It kicks ass against when the elements of your skiing up in Colorado,

4410
01:50:02.321 --> 01:50:03.154
if you're at the beach.

4411
01:50:03.250 --> 01:50:07.720
So it's just a long tube along who could hose with a wooden handle.

4412
01:50:07.721 --> 01:50:09.100
And then at the endorsing this,

4413
01:50:09.101 --> 01:50:10.270
did you say while you're driving,

4414
01:50:10.271 --> 01:50:11.760
did you really just say that absolutely dead?

4415
01:50:12.160 --> 01:50:16.420
Why would you ever want to get behind a product that you're trying to sell and

4416
01:50:16.421 --> 01:50:18.520
you're saying who's this and drive?

4417
01:50:18.760 --> 01:50:18.941
No,

4418
01:50:18.941 --> 01:50:20.140
I'm not saying use this and drive.

4419
01:50:20.141 --> 01:50:21.740
I'm saying drive while you're girlfriend license.

4420
01:50:22.200 --> 01:50:23.140
That's what I'm going to show.

4421
01:50:23.150 --> 01:50:23.471
Come on.

4422
01:50:23.471 --> 01:50:23.831
What do you think?

4423
01:50:23.831 --> 01:50:25.010
I'm new and you think I was born yet?

4424
01:50:25.100 --> 01:50:27.070
Ecru to be saying this on the radio.

4425
01:50:27.310 --> 01:50:27.860
Internet.

4426
01:50:27.860 --> 01:50:29.140
So cast thingy.

4427
01:50:29.200 --> 01:50:29.860
So anyway,

4428
01:50:29.860 --> 01:50:31.180
I didn't save you put pot in there.

4429
01:50:31.181 --> 01:50:31.840
It's for cigarettes.

4430
01:50:31.840 --> 01:50:33.640
Not everybody should be doing that.

4431
01:50:33.670 --> 01:50:33.820
Yeah.

4432
01:50:33.820 --> 01:50:34.730
Not everybody should do that.

4433
01:50:34.731 --> 01:50:35.620
Like everything else.

4434
01:50:37.360 --> 01:50:38.560
Can't even handle jerking off.

4435
01:50:38.561 --> 01:50:39.390
How about that?

4436
01:50:39.390 --> 01:50:40.270
They can break things.

4437
01:50:40.300 --> 01:50:43.840
They can choose their jobs because they can't stop jerking off at work about

4438
01:50:43.841 --> 01:50:44.110
that.

4439
01:50:44.110 --> 01:50:44.680
Right.

4440
01:50:44.680 --> 01:50:46.260
And then come see me at the comedy store.

4441
01:50:46.710 --> 01:50:47.650
Do you ever come back?

4442
01:50:47.651 --> 01:50:48.121
That'd be great.

4443
01:50:48.121 --> 01:50:48.460
Possible.

4444
01:50:48.460 --> 01:50:48.950
I know you won't.

4445
01:50:48.950 --> 01:50:49.530
Can't happen.

4446
01:50:49.530 --> 01:50:51.880
You're a man of your word every weekend at the comedy store.

4447
01:50:51.881 --> 01:50:52.810
Listen to the podcast.

4452
01:50:59.060 --> 01:50:59.860
What's done?

4453
01:50:59.860 --> 01:51:01.660
How many weeks or days a week you're doing this?

4454
01:51:01.870 --> 01:51:02.800
We're doing it once a week.

4455
01:51:03.070 --> 01:51:03.531
Once a week.

4456
01:51:03.531 --> 01:51:03.730
Yeah.

4457
01:51:03.730 --> 01:51:04.300
Powerful.

4458
01:51:04.300 --> 01:51:05.133
Yeah.

4459
01:51:05.170 --> 01:51:07.930
This Wednesday we have one more podcast rocking with,

4460
01:51:07.931 --> 01:51:08.590
uh,

4461
01:51:08.590 --> 01:51:10.690
my friend Chris who changed his fucking name,

4462
01:51:11.100 --> 01:51:15.100
Chris a used to be the guy from the flashlight and he quit working for the

4463
01:51:15.101 --> 01:51:20.101
flashlight and started on it labs and on it is on it.com o n n I t.com.

4464
01:51:20.381 --> 01:51:23.830
And that's the company that we're working with and we're putting together this

4465
01:51:23.831 --> 01:51:25.780
Alpha brain package.

4466
01:51:25.810 --> 01:51:27.940
It fucking works for real.

4467
01:51:28.700 --> 01:51:29.650
It's not snake oil.

4468
01:51:29.651 --> 01:51:29.831
Yeah,

4469
01:51:29.831 --> 01:51:30.910
I just got a couple of new bottles.

4470
01:51:30.940 --> 01:51:31.810
It's not snake oil.

4471
01:51:31.811 --> 01:51:32.021
I know.

4472
01:51:32.021 --> 01:51:32.770
People are like,

4473
01:51:32.770 --> 01:51:33.431
you know why it's,

4474
01:51:33.431 --> 01:51:34.181
what are you selling?

4475
01:51:34.181 --> 01:51:34.630
Like,

4476
01:51:34.630 --> 01:51:35.170
look,

4477
01:51:35.170 --> 01:51:37.630
I have a very small stake in this and I,

4478
01:51:37.631 --> 01:51:38.411
I really,

4479
01:51:38.411 --> 01:51:39.400
really believe in it.

4480
01:51:39.460 --> 01:51:41.170
What it is is nutrients for your brain.

4481
01:51:41.410 --> 01:51:42.400
It's really that simple.

4482
01:51:42.401 --> 01:51:47.401
It's all scientist based common goals and fucking testing test has been done and

4483
01:51:50.300 --> 01:51:53.110
Paco binds in order thing that's known to work,

4484
01:51:53.280 --> 01:51:53.690
you know,

4485
01:51:53.690 --> 01:51:54.520
into one pill.

4486
01:51:54.520 --> 01:51:56.680
So you're not having 5,000 pills to take.

4487
01:51:56.681 --> 01:52:00.790
There's plenty of evidence on the Internet about there's various supplements

4488
01:52:00.791 --> 01:52:02.680
that you can take that increased mental function.

4489
01:52:02.860 --> 01:52:03.071
You know,

4490
01:52:03.071 --> 01:52:03.491
I know,

4491
01:52:03.491 --> 01:52:04.120
um,

4492
01:52:04.120 --> 01:52:05.140
the football player,

4493
01:52:05.200 --> 01:52:06.250
a Roman ASCII bill,

4494
01:52:06.251 --> 01:52:07.570
Rowan Ascii is that his name,

4495
01:52:08.570 --> 01:52:09.430
a Broncos.

4496
01:52:10.420 --> 01:52:11.680
Roman ASCII had a,

4497
01:52:11.690 --> 01:52:12.280
um,

4498
01:52:12.280 --> 01:52:15.550
a company called neuro one and I took their shit and it's,

4499
01:52:15.551 --> 01:52:17.380
it really works and it's like,

4500
01:52:17.530 --> 01:52:18.040
it,

4501
01:52:18.040 --> 01:52:18.521
it makes you,

4502
01:52:18.521 --> 01:52:20.350
it gives you this heightened sense of awareness.

4503
01:52:20.530 --> 01:52:23.020
And I found that I could access information easier.

4504
01:52:23.021 --> 01:52:24.580
I've found that my memory work clear.

4505
01:52:24.790 --> 01:52:25.630
I found that,

4506
01:52:25.660 --> 01:52:25.831
uh,

4507
01:52:25.831 --> 01:52:28.090
I felt like I was a little bit more creative.

4508
01:52:28.091 --> 01:52:32.770
Like my thoughts were flowing and I don't know what these substances do exactly.

4509
01:52:32.771 --> 01:52:33.131
Other than that,

4510
01:52:33.131 --> 01:52:35.260
I know that they're all herbal and that they're all,

4511
01:52:35.261 --> 01:52:35.630
you know,

4512
01:52:35.630 --> 01:52:39.190
they've basically been proven throughout the years to have a subjective effect

4513
01:52:39.191 --> 01:52:40.210
on people's consciousness.

4514
01:52:40.330 --> 01:52:40.721
Yeah,

4515
01:52:40.721 --> 01:52:41.011
and you know,

4516
01:52:41.011 --> 01:52:41.230
I,

4517
01:52:41.230 --> 01:52:41.891
I told you,

4518
01:52:41.891 --> 01:52:43.180
I just took a couple of the other night,

4519
01:52:43.181 --> 01:52:47.240
but I was able to get into that link still and meditation mode that I normally

4520
01:52:47.241 --> 01:52:48.370
find very hard to get into.

4521
01:52:48.371 --> 01:52:49.430
The amazing for dreams.

4522
01:52:49.460 --> 01:52:51.370
It gives me the most incredible dream.

4523
01:52:51.440 --> 01:52:52.130
Yeah.

4524
01:52:52.130 --> 01:52:55.510
I don't take it at night because I don't want to have these nutty fucking take

4525
01:52:55.520 --> 01:52:56.353
it in the morning.

4526
01:52:57.890 --> 01:52:58.701
I took it at night,

4527
01:52:58.701 --> 01:52:59.960
but I fall asleep awake.

4528
01:52:59.961 --> 01:53:04.961
So I took that and it was fucking awesome and it's great for jet lag when you,

4529
01:53:05.001 --> 01:53:06.530
when you fly into some new place,

4530
01:53:06.570 --> 01:53:08.120
that's when it clears the cobwebs out.

4531
01:53:08.121 --> 01:53:10.310
I popped three of those bad boys consciousness.

4532
01:53:10.860 --> 01:53:11.940
I'm signs cards,

4533
01:53:11.990 --> 01:53:12.741
Alpha brain,

4534
01:53:12.741 --> 01:53:13.300
it's all gone.

4535
01:53:13.300 --> 01:53:14.133
I,

4536
01:53:15.040 --> 01:53:15.530
it's,

4537
01:53:15.530 --> 01:53:18.590
you can only preorder right now and we'll have Chris on,

4538
01:53:18.591 --> 01:53:19.440
on [inaudible].

4539
01:53:19.790 --> 01:53:20.750
I'm not calling them Aubrey.

4540
01:53:21.030 --> 01:53:21.340
Come on.

4541
01:53:21.340 --> 01:53:21.920
What have in him,

4542
01:53:21.920 --> 01:53:22.730
I change his name.

4543
01:53:22.730 --> 01:53:23.930
This is homeboy went to,

4544
01:53:23.931 --> 01:53:26.060
you're going to love this podcast is going to be a lot of fun because he's a

4545
01:53:26.061 --> 01:53:26.781
brilliant guy.

4546
01:53:26.781 --> 01:53:27.620
I love him to death.

4547
01:53:27.860 --> 01:53:31.370
He went to Peru and drank from the vine.

4548
01:53:31.371 --> 01:53:33.110
He went and had a shamonic experience.

4549
01:53:33.111 --> 01:53:38.111
Several of them drinking IOWASCA and he had some sort of an a revelation that he

4550
01:53:39.351 --> 01:53:44.351
needed to restart his life by changing his name or he murdered somebody and has

4551
01:53:44.850 --> 01:53:45.890
named his middle name,

4552
01:53:46.310 --> 01:53:47.143
middle name.

4553
01:53:47.360 --> 01:53:48.410
Either gain or something,

4554
01:53:48.411 --> 01:53:48.591
you know,

4555
01:53:48.591 --> 01:53:49.460
should I Alaska,

4556
01:53:49.910 --> 01:53:50.391
which is,

4557
01:53:50.391 --> 01:53:50.690
you know,

4558
01:53:50.690 --> 01:53:53.150
literally that's the spirit shit.

4559
01:53:53.180 --> 01:53:55.010
That's basically DMT in a,

4560
01:53:55.011 --> 01:53:56.000
in an oral form.

4561
01:53:56.310 --> 01:53:59.480
It's the most intense experience you can have supposedly told me about that.

4562
01:53:59.481 --> 01:54:00.290
I'm scared to try it.

4563
01:54:00.290 --> 01:54:01.280
You should be,

4564
01:54:01.460 --> 01:54:03.920
but he's going to come out on Wednesday and explained to us why it took on a

4565
01:54:03.921 --> 01:54:08.570
girl's name and tell us in that Wednesday will be when this shit will be for

4566
01:54:08.571 --> 01:54:09.404
sale.

4567
01:54:09.620 --> 01:54:10.431
If you don't like it,

4568
01:54:10.431 --> 01:54:11.000
don't buy it.

4569
01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:11.150
I,

4570
01:54:11.150 --> 01:54:11.961
if you can't afford it,

4571
01:54:11.961 --> 01:54:12.291
don't buy it.

4572
01:54:12.291 --> 01:54:15.380
I don't want anybody spending any money that they don't want to spend.

4573
01:54:15.381 --> 01:54:16.580
I don't want you to a,

4574
01:54:16.581 --> 01:54:20.720
I don't want you to ever think that you know that advertising should ever really

4575
01:54:20.721 --> 01:54:22.010
work on you with any shit like this.

4576
01:54:22.011 --> 01:54:24.230
But what I am telling you is it as a product,

4577
01:54:24.231 --> 01:54:25.670
I think there's some merit to this.

4578
01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:27.110
I think it's a,

4579
01:54:27.140 --> 01:54:27.471
it's a,

4580
01:54:27.471 --> 01:54:32.090
it's a strange combination of nutrients and together and conjunction and when

4581
01:54:32.091 --> 01:54:33.560
they work together synergistically,

4582
01:54:33.561 --> 01:54:35.090
I think it has an effect on your mind.

4583
01:54:35.270 --> 01:54:36.080
I feel it,

4584
01:54:36.080 --> 01:54:37.700
you feel too full bars.

4585
01:54:37.701 --> 01:54:38.534
That's what it does.

4586
01:54:38.990 --> 01:54:39.920
I think it's Legit,

4587
01:54:40.130 --> 01:54:40.521
you know?

4588
01:54:40.521 --> 01:54:44.600
And I think it's probably also one of those things that in time as you continue

4589
01:54:44.601 --> 01:54:44.811
to do it,

4590
01:54:44.811 --> 01:54:46.550
it's like when you take vitamins,

4591
01:54:46.640 --> 01:54:48.800
like I noticed for me at least,

4592
01:54:48.890 --> 01:54:51.230
if I stopped taking vitamins for like a week or so,

4593
01:54:51.350 --> 01:54:52.161
I take them,

4594
01:54:52.161 --> 01:54:53.240
I start taking them again.

4595
01:54:53.240 --> 01:54:55.940
I'll feel good for one day and then I'll feel better the next day and then I'll

4596
01:54:55.941 --> 01:54:59.210
feel a little bit better and I feel a little more even and I'll feel a little

4597
01:54:59.211 --> 01:54:59.991
more energy.

4598
01:54:59.991 --> 01:55:00.650
I feel a little more,

4599
01:55:00.650 --> 01:55:01.820
I feel better,

4600
01:55:02.180 --> 01:55:03.200
more with time.

4601
01:55:03.201 --> 01:55:04.760
So if I'm consistent with vitamins,

4602
01:55:04.761 --> 01:55:05.160
if I,

4603
01:55:05.160 --> 01:55:05.550
you know,

4604
01:55:05.550 --> 01:55:07.550
I get lazy sometimes and I'll take a couple of days off.

4605
01:55:07.551 --> 01:55:10.250
But if I'm real consistent after five or six days,

4606
01:55:10.251 --> 01:55:12.950
that's when I really start to feel subjectively.

4607
01:55:12.951 --> 01:55:13.990
I really start to feel the effect.

4608
01:55:14.010 --> 01:55:14.930
Like I feel energetic.

4609
01:55:14.931 --> 01:55:16.040
I feel really healthy right now.

4610
01:55:16.280 --> 01:55:19.130
I think a lot of it has to do with a really balanced diet and getting all my

4611
01:55:19.131 --> 01:55:19.964
nutrients in order.

4612
01:55:20.150 --> 01:55:21.470
I think that's the same with this shit.

4613
01:55:21.710 --> 01:55:22.580
Cause as I've taken it,

4614
01:55:22.581 --> 01:55:24.140
the more of taking it more days in a row,

4615
01:55:24.290 --> 01:55:26.930
the more I start feeling like really tuned in man.

4616
01:55:26.960 --> 01:55:28.160
Cause it's like you get your mind,

4617
01:55:28.161 --> 01:55:31.130
body and soul and once you get all those three things hit and it's so seldom we

4618
01:55:31.131 --> 01:55:31.731
have it like that,

4619
01:55:31.731 --> 01:55:32.271
that that,

4620
01:55:32.271 --> 01:55:33.590
but if you can find that balance,

4621
01:55:33.591 --> 01:55:33.850
man,

4622
01:55:33.850 --> 01:55:34.030
shit,

4623
01:55:34.030 --> 01:55:36.500
soul is a silly word is a funny one.

4624
01:55:36.530 --> 01:55:36.951
It's like what are,

4625
01:55:36.951 --> 01:55:38.020
what are we even talking about here?

4626
01:55:38.050 --> 01:55:38.883
No one can agree.

4627
01:55:39.530 --> 01:55:40.011
I like that.

4628
01:55:40.011 --> 01:55:44.050
I don't want to call it greens down with waffles and chicken together.

4629
01:55:44.080 --> 01:55:46.500
They're delicious combination brisket Nigga,

4630
01:55:46.501 --> 01:55:47.334
what?

4631
01:55:47.490 --> 01:55:49.440
It's not a fig Fogo de Chao at the mall.

4632
01:55:49.890 --> 01:55:50.760
I liked that place.

4633
01:55:50.780 --> 01:55:51.530
It's good.

4634
01:55:51.530 --> 01:55:52.400
The fake one at the malls.

4635
01:55:52.410 --> 01:55:53.243
Not Bad.

4636
01:55:53.300 --> 01:55:54.870
The two [inaudible] my friend,

4637
01:55:55.340 --> 01:55:56.173
um,

4638
01:55:56.520 --> 01:55:57.420
August 13th,

4639
01:55:57.421 --> 01:55:59.760
I'm in Milwaukee at the PAPP's theater.

4640
01:55:59.880 --> 01:56:01.530
There's still some tickets available for that.

4641
01:56:01.531 --> 01:56:02.880
That's going to be a lot of fun.

4642
01:56:02.910 --> 01:56:05.280
I'll be bringing Joey Diaz with me to Milwaukee.

4643
01:56:05.550 --> 01:56:07.770
I haven't been back to Milwaukee and a long time,

4644
01:56:07.771 --> 01:56:09.360
but I'm looking forward to going there.

4645
01:56:09.360 --> 01:56:10.193
And it's a,

4646
01:56:10.710 --> 01:56:12.890
they're having a UFC there too and that's the home of,

4647
01:56:12.891 --> 01:56:13.260
uh,

4648
01:56:13.260 --> 01:56:14.100
the Rufus camp.

4649
01:56:14.101 --> 01:56:18.990
One of the best when we tie a camps in America is a out of Milwaukee and they

4650
01:56:18.991 --> 01:56:21.000
also have a lot of guys will fight in the UFC.

4651
01:56:21.001 --> 01:56:22.170
Pat Barry fights with them.

4652
01:56:22.171 --> 01:56:23.310
Anthony Pettis fights for them.

4653
01:56:23.610 --> 01:56:24.450
So Milwaukee's a,

4654
01:56:24.451 --> 01:56:27.210
a bad ass town to have a UFC and to do comedy there.

4655
01:56:27.211 --> 01:56:28.740
So yeah,

4656
01:56:29.150 --> 01:56:30.050
I've loved doing that.

4657
01:56:30.060 --> 01:56:30.330
That's,

4658
01:56:30.330 --> 01:56:34.800
there's nothing more fun for me than when I do like a weekend where I do stand

4659
01:56:34.801 --> 01:56:36.750
up one night and then the UFC is the next night.

4660
01:56:37.580 --> 01:56:38.413
It's like,

4661
01:56:39.060 --> 01:56:40.660
really fuck.

4662
01:56:40.680 --> 01:56:40.850
Yeah,

4663
01:56:40.850 --> 01:56:41.070
yeah,

4664
01:56:41.070 --> 01:56:41.670
yeah.

4665
01:56:41.670 --> 01:56:42.180
I'll hook them up.

4666
01:56:42.180 --> 01:56:42.390
Okay.

4667
01:56:42.390 --> 01:56:45.330
So that's a August 13th in Milwaukee at the PAPP's theater.

4668
01:56:45.331 --> 01:56:46.290
Can't fucking wait for that.

4669
01:56:46.291 --> 01:56:47.580
Joey Diaz is coming with me.

4670
01:56:47.880 --> 01:56:49.680
If you have never seen Joey Diaz before,

4671
01:56:49.830 --> 01:56:50.940
he's bringing the thunder.

4672
01:56:51.150 --> 01:56:56.150
September 23rd Joey Diaz and I are at the paramount theater in Denver,

4673
01:56:56.281 --> 01:56:57.180
Colorado.

4674
01:56:57.450 --> 01:56:58.080
Um,

4675
01:56:58.080 --> 01:56:59.550
and tickets are selling fast to that.

4676
01:56:59.551 --> 01:57:00.900
So a hop on that shit.

4677
01:57:01.530 --> 01:57:02.400
The paramount theater,

4678
01:57:02.430 --> 01:57:03.950
we tried to bring him to a,

4679
01:57:04.030 --> 01:57:04.711
the comedy works,

4680
01:57:04.711 --> 01:57:04.931
but Joe,

4681
01:57:04.931 --> 01:57:07.680
he's banned from the comedy works cause something naughty.

4682
01:57:07.681 --> 01:57:08.610
He did back in,

4683
01:57:08.611 --> 01:57:11.970
it's open mic days when he was struggling and clawing and scratching.

4684
01:57:12.330 --> 01:57:13.230
And so he's a,

4685
01:57:13.231 --> 01:57:14.520
he's banned from the franchise.

4686
01:57:14.521 --> 01:57:15.001
He can't work.

4687
01:57:15.001 --> 01:57:15.690
The company works.

4688
01:57:15.690 --> 01:57:18.990
So we have circumvented system and brought him into the paramount theater.

4689
01:57:19.220 --> 01:57:19.591
DENVER,

4690
01:57:19.591 --> 01:57:20.161
Colorado.

4691
01:57:20.161 --> 01:57:21.630
I bring you Joey Diaz.

4692
01:57:22.470 --> 01:57:22.981
What the fuck?

4693
01:57:22.981 --> 01:57:23.814
Cock suckers.

4694
01:57:23.880 --> 01:57:25.770
You got to see Joey Diaz at one time in your life.

4695
01:57:25.800 --> 01:57:27.900
It's like I got to see Kennison live when I was a kid.

4696
01:57:28.230 --> 01:57:28.471
You know,

4697
01:57:28.471 --> 01:57:29.820
you need to see Joey Diaz live.

4698
01:57:29.850 --> 01:57:31.590
That's September 23rd Denver,

4699
01:57:31.591 --> 01:57:32.280
Colorado.

4700
01:57:32.280 --> 01:57:33.780
Holla at your boy.

4701
01:57:33.870 --> 01:57:35.220
So we'll be back next,

4702
01:57:35.280 --> 01:57:35.911
this Wednesday,

4703
01:57:35.911 --> 01:57:39.450
this upcoming Wednesday with a my friend Chris Marcus who wants me to call him

4704
01:57:39.451 --> 01:57:39.870
Aubrey.

4705
01:57:39.870 --> 01:57:43.770
But that shit ain't happening and he's going to tell us all about how he went to

4706
01:57:43.771 --> 01:57:45.480
the jungle and took on a girl's name.

4707
01:57:45.660 --> 01:57:47.100
And I think what we need to do is,

4708
01:57:47.101 --> 01:57:47.640
uh,

4709
01:57:47.640 --> 01:57:49.680
I think Iowasca gave him a girl's name.

4710
01:57:49.740 --> 01:57:50.640
Jack Daniels.

4711
01:57:50.700 --> 01:57:52.020
Give him a fucking man's name.

4712
01:57:52.230 --> 01:57:52.771
We're going to route,

4713
01:57:52.771 --> 01:57:53.541
we're going to take them out.

4714
01:57:53.541 --> 01:57:55.470
We're going to give us some shots and we're going to get them to a band,

4715
01:57:55.471 --> 01:57:58.330
that girlie name and come up with something better like bolt.

4716
01:57:58.630 --> 01:57:59.690
This is your new name.

4717
01:57:59.691 --> 01:58:00.070
Lunch.

4718
01:58:00.070 --> 01:58:01.800
