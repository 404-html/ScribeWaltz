<v Speaker 1>that car,</v>

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.920

46
00:01:09.311 --> 00:01:10.144
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>

47
00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.420
<v Speaker 3>I wonder are what quick wonderful relationship.</v>

48
00:01:13.421 --> 00:01:14.254
<v Speaker 3>This is.</v>

49
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.301
<v Speaker 1>Then I got the car.</v>

50
00:01:15.301 --> 00:01:16.150
<v Speaker 1>I paid cash.</v>

51
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.871
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

52
00:01:16.871 --> 00:01:17.381
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

53
00:01:17.381 --> 00:01:19.180
<v Speaker 1>that's a war horse of a fucking car,</v>

54
00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.150
<v Speaker 1>but Don Maria has no goddamn navigation system in that thing,</v>

55
00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.350
<v Speaker 1>but it looks beautiful.</v>

56
00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.760
<v Speaker 1>I listened to the ground like it's like an Indian scout dumped them.</v>

57
00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm feeling the wheels beneath my feet.</v>

58
00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.191
<v Speaker 1>All radio.</v>

59
00:01:30.191 --> 00:01:31.750
<v Speaker 1>That's an evil work and fix it.</v>

60
00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.390
<v Speaker 1>I had my radio break once and it fucking,</v>

61
00:01:34.391 --> 00:01:36.250
<v Speaker 1>I thought up more shit that day.</v>

62
00:01:36.251 --> 00:01:39.700
<v Speaker 1>Then and then any other day I like I should break my radio all the time.</v>

63
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.350
<v Speaker 2>The biggest drag or that car is it only has a tape deck.</v>

64
00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.040
<v Speaker 3>Oh no it does.</v>

65
00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.190
<v Speaker 3>It's really hard to get tapes.</v>

66
00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.960
<v Speaker 3>I went into a place and they have no</v>

67
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.930
<v Speaker 1>tapes left.</v>

68
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.030
<v Speaker 1>That is Goddamn hilarious.</v>

69
00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.930
<v Speaker 1>You have a tape deck,</v>

70
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.300
<v Speaker 3>but all these other cars I've got it.</v>

71
00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.050
<v Speaker 3>I've got a brand new Cadillac for leasing and all that.</v>

72
00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:00.360
<v Speaker 3>Something went wrong with him.</v>

73
00:02:00.361 --> 00:02:00.691
<v Speaker 3>This one,</v>

74
00:02:00.691 --> 00:02:01.530
<v Speaker 3>nothing stops it.</v>

75
00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.711
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

76
00:02:01.711 --> 00:02:03.810
<v Speaker 3>you know those Lexus's or fucking bulletproof.</v>

81
00:02:15.541 --> 00:02:16.680
<v Speaker 3>go on some MCT oil.</v>

82
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.390
<v Speaker 2>Could you repeat that because I didn't get that.</v>

83
00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.660
<v Speaker 2>This</v>

84
00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.340
<v Speaker 1>is a complicated advertisement.</v>

<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

101
00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:58.170
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

102
00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.381
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

103
00:02:58.381 --> 00:02:59.214
<v Speaker 1>Hepped up on.</v>

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.290
<v Speaker 1>None of these things will get you higher,</v>

105
00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.191
<v Speaker 1>but a,</v>

106
00:03:02.191 --> 00:03:04.260
<v Speaker 1>the Alpha brain will definitely,</v>

107
00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:05.491
<v Speaker 1>hopefully,</v>

108
00:03:05.491 --> 00:03:06.300
<v Speaker 1>if it works for you,</v>

109
00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.070
<v Speaker 1>it works for almost everybody.</v>

110
00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.840
<v Speaker 1>But I believe people,</v>

111
00:03:09.841 --> 00:03:11.220
<v Speaker 1>when they say it has no effect on him.</v>

112
00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.480
<v Speaker 1>I absolutely believe them.</v>

113
00:03:12.481 --> 00:03:14.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how you're fucking dumb marks.</v>

114
00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't even understand how mind works.</v>

115
00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.960
<v Speaker 1>But I do know that every single ingredient,</v>

116
00:03:18.961 --> 00:03:21.330
<v Speaker 1>if you go to onnit.com there's a whole page.</v>

117
00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:26.610
<v Speaker 1>It's a based on the science behind all of these supplements and all of it has</v>

118
00:03:27.871 --> 00:03:32.280
<v Speaker 1>been shown to increase memory or a aid and test scores.</v>

119
00:03:32.281 --> 00:03:32.760
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

120
00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.450
<v Speaker 1>they're all just essentially nutrients that help cognitive function.</v>

121
00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.390
<v Speaker 1>It's a very controversial thing and because it's controversial,</v>

122
00:03:39.391 --> 00:03:44.391
<v Speaker 1>we want to treat this thing like as evenly and as honestly and as morally as</v>

123
00:03:45.601 --> 00:03:46.171
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>

124
00:03:46.171 --> 00:03:47.910
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of hard to do when you run a business,</v>

125
00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:53.270
<v Speaker 1>but the idea behind on it is a real genuine and honest one.</v>

126
00:03:53.851 --> 00:03:57.420
<v Speaker 1>And it's to try to sell you the best shit possible at,</v>

127
00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.100
<v Speaker 1>at a very reasonable price and make it so that no one feels ripped off.</v>

128
00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:07.100
<v Speaker 1>And one of the ways we do that is we have a 90 day 100% money back guarantee on</v>

129
00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:10.500
<v Speaker 1>the first 30 pills of whether it's Alpha brain,</v>

130
00:04:10.501 --> 00:04:11.334
<v Speaker 1>a shroom tech.</v>

131
00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:12.330
<v Speaker 1>If you try it,</v>

132
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.631
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

133
00:04:12.631 --> 00:04:12.960
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

134
00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:13.231
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

135
00:04:13.231 --> 00:04:13.831
<v Speaker 1>you use it,</v>

136
00:04:13.831 --> 00:04:14.880
<v Speaker 1>you don't feel like it was,</v>

137
00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.740
<v Speaker 1>it had an effect on you get your money back,</v>

138
00:04:16.741 --> 00:04:17.820
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have to return the product.</v>

139
00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:18.960
<v Speaker 1>No one's trying to rip you off,</v>

140
00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.071
<v Speaker 1>but we're,</v>

141
00:04:20.071 --> 00:04:25.071
<v Speaker 1>what we are doing is selling you the best shit possible that we actually use</v>

142
00:04:26.431 --> 00:04:27.120
<v Speaker 1>ourselves.</v>

143
00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.040
<v Speaker 1>I actually use Alpha brain,</v>

144
00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.941
<v Speaker 1>shroom tech,</v>

145
00:04:29.941 --> 00:04:30.331
<v Speaker 1>new mood.</v>

<v Speaker 4>He distended it.</v>

234

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.160
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of an interesting approach to life.</v>

246
00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:03.340
<v Speaker 1>Just talking about backfire.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I see that kerosene games is one of our new sponsors and they have this new game</v>

250
00:07:13.221 --> 00:07:15.200
<v Speaker 1>called blade runner or blade slinger.</v>

<v Speaker 1>the graphics are amazing.</v>

259
00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:23.730
<v Speaker 1>It's that is,</v>

260
00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:25.520
<v Speaker 1>that's the actual graphics of the game.</v>

261
00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:30.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean it is really well done and it's not a game that's ported over from a</v>

262
00:07:30.411 --> 00:07:31.160
<v Speaker 1>computer.</v>

266
00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:41.060

313
00:08:37.811 --> 00:08:41.230
<v Speaker 5>Especially the galaxy s three and one is the Google maps.</v>

314
00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.390
<v Speaker 5>Like just having Google maps back,</v>

315
00:08:43.391 --> 00:08:46.060
<v Speaker 5>the original application that's not on the iPhone anymore.</v>

316
00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:47.350
<v Speaker 5>It's so nice.</v>

317
00:08:47.351 --> 00:08:49.720
<v Speaker 5>And on the Google or the the galaxy s three,</v>

00:08:56.051 --> 00:08:56.980
<v Speaker 5>I'm still playing with it.</v>

324
00:08:56.981 --> 00:09:00.640
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if it's just because I'm so used to the iPhone for the last five</v>

325
00:09:00.641 --> 00:09:04.990
<v Speaker 5>years using the same operating system or if it's just like everything is set up</v>

326
00:09:04.991 --> 00:09:05.860
<v Speaker 5>so nice.</v>

327
00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:06.601
<v Speaker 6>It's very,</v>

328
00:09:06.601 --> 00:09:07.500
<v Speaker 6>very intuitive.</v>

00:11:36.621 --> 00:11:36.801
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

424
00:11:36.801 --> 00:11:38.420

425
00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:38.780

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:41.750
<v Speaker 6>I like down.</v>

429
00:11:41.751 --> 00:11:43.280
<v Speaker 6>So I like tranquilizers.</v>

430
00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:45.350
<v Speaker 6>If I was going to do any drug,</v>

431
00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:46.363
<v Speaker 6>I would do heroin.</v>

432
00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:47.540
<v Speaker 6>But what,</v>

433
00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:48.171
<v Speaker 6>from what they say,</v>

434
00:11:48.171 --> 00:11:51.650
<v Speaker 6>it feels like Robert Schimmel told me he accidentally took Adderall once.</v>

435
00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:52.611
<v Speaker 6>He,</v>

<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

437
00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:57.360
<v Speaker 6>I guess it was someone he thought it was one of his pills after he had his heart</v>

438
00:11:57.361 --> 00:11:57.980
<v Speaker 6>condition.</v>

<v Speaker 6>He had cancer and cancer,</v>

440
00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:01.680
<v Speaker 6>cancer and he had a heart condition as well.</v>

441
00:12:01.681 --> 00:12:01.861
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

442
00:12:01.861 --> 00:12:02.970
<v Speaker 6>It was having a hard problems,</v>

443

<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

444
00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:04.070
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

445
00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:05.010
<v Speaker 6>whatever he was on,</v>

446
00:12:05.011 --> 00:12:06.060
<v Speaker 6>whatever medication he is on,</v>

447
00:12:06.061 --> 00:12:10.140
<v Speaker 6>he accidentally take someone else's Adderall while he was worried.</v>

448
00:12:10.141 --> 00:12:11.100
<v Speaker 6>But his doctor said he would help,</v>

449
00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:11.940
<v Speaker 6>would be okay.</v>

450
00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:12.091
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

451
00:12:12.091 --> 00:12:12.650

454
00:12:14.701 --> 00:12:15.534
<v Speaker 6>How many milligrams?</v>

455
00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:16.561
<v Speaker 6>You're going to be fine.</v>

456
00:12:16.561 --> 00:12:17.700
<v Speaker 6>It's just going to take a while.</v>

457
00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:18.700
<v Speaker 6>Just go get them.</v>

458
00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:19.440
<v Speaker 6>He's done.</v>

459
00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:21.060
<v Speaker 6>So he let run it around his house.</v>

460
00:12:21.061 --> 00:12:21.811
<v Speaker 6>He's be organized.</v>

461
00:12:21.811 --> 00:12:22.644
<v Speaker 6>His office,</v>

462
00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:25.890
<v Speaker 6>he said he organized all of his notes and put them in alphabetical order,</v>

463
00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:28.680
<v Speaker 6>like doing shit that he would never do without it.</v>

464
00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:29.910
<v Speaker 6>It makes you think like,</v>

465
00:12:29.911 --> 00:12:30.181
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

466

00:12:30.631 --> 00:12:30.841
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

468
00:12:30.841 --> 00:12:32.610
<v Speaker 6>if you could manage that correctly,</v>

469
00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:36.360
<v Speaker 6>if you were a confident that you could manage that Adderall stuff,</v>

470
00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.340
<v Speaker 6>it seems like you get a lot of shit done on that.</v>

471
00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:40.320
<v Speaker 6>It coffee gets me high.</v>

472
00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:40.951

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:42.901
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

00:12:42.901 --> 00:12:43.691
<v Speaker 6>I mean that's what it looks.</v>

476
00:12:43.691 --> 00:12:44.850
<v Speaker 6>Especially Starbucks.</v>

477
00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:45.061
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

478
00:12:45.061 --> 00:12:47.010
<v Speaker 6>that's why this stuff is a everywhere.</v>

479
00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:48.420
<v Speaker 6>Everybody's addicted to this stuff.</v>

480
00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:51.570
<v Speaker 2>That was that last night I had two drinks and I couldn't interview you.</v>

481
00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:53.130
<v Speaker 2>You get an Mba.</v>

482
00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:53.820
<v Speaker 2>We were fun.</v>

483
00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:54.370
<v Speaker 2>It was fun.</v>

484
00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:54.781
<v Speaker 2>It's fun.</v>

485
00:12:54.781 --> 00:12:55.140
<v Speaker 2>But I was,</v>

486
00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:55.921
<v Speaker 2>I had to think,</v>

487
00:12:55.921 --> 00:12:56.101
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

488
00:12:56.101 --> 00:12:56.611
<v Speaker 2>usually,</v>

489
00:12:56.611 --> 00:12:58.440
<v Speaker 2>I mean with you it's like just flows.</v>

490
00:12:58.441 --> 00:13:01.140
<v Speaker 2>But I'm telling you the two drinks affecting me ever since.</v>

491
00:13:01.141 --> 00:13:02.520
<v Speaker 2>I said I stopped drinking.</v>

492
00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:03.540
<v Speaker 2>I started,</v>

493
00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:03.990
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

494
00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:05.130
<v Speaker 2>I thought you stopped drinking.</v>

495
00:13:05.131 --> 00:13:05.670
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>

496
00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:06.590
<v Speaker 2>I Sat,</v>

497
00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:07.111
<v Speaker 2>but I do.</v>

498
00:13:07.111 --> 00:13:09.840
<v Speaker 2>I stopped drinking and then I have a couple drinks every night almost to</v>

499
00:13:09.841 --> 00:13:12.610
<v Speaker 2>celebrate my sobriety and that's,</v>

500
00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:13.873
<v Speaker 2>that's what happens.</v>

501
00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:17.040
<v Speaker 2>I get higher because I don't drink as much.</v>

502
00:13:17.041 --> 00:13:18.550
<v Speaker 2>And I had those two Irish coffees.</v>

503
00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:18.930
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

504
00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:19.763
<v Speaker 2>I was fucking,</v>

505
00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:23.220
<v Speaker 2>how many days a week are you back to drinking a seven?</v>

506

507
00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:28.890
<v Speaker 2>I didn't drink on Monday.</v>

508
00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:30.060
<v Speaker 2>And I told my God,</v>

509

512
00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:34.021
<v Speaker 2>She said,</v>

586
00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:00.340
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

587
00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:01.173
<v Speaker 4>just like,</v>

588
00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:01.980
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

589
00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:04.060
<v Speaker 4>Well you realize you're killing your body slower.</v>

590
00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:04.450
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

591
00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:04.650
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

592
00:15:04.650 --> 00:15:05.441
<v Speaker 4>that's the feeling.</v>

593
00:15:05.441 --> 00:15:07.600
<v Speaker 4>Like you realize your impending doom.</v>

594
00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:08.381
<v Speaker 4>That's a danger.</v>

595
00:15:08.381 --> 00:15:09.191
<v Speaker 4>Be a comedian too.</v>

596
00:15:09.191 --> 00:15:12.820
<v Speaker 4>Cause you can fucking live the life of a degenerate and then be fine by 10</v>

597
00:15:12.821 --> 00:15:13.654
<v Speaker 4>o'clock at night.</v>

598
00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:16.090
<v Speaker 4>And let's be honest about,</v>

599
00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:16.361
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

600
00:15:16.361 --> 00:15:17.194
<v Speaker 4>how much,</v>

601
00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:20.170
<v Speaker 4>how much sobriety is required in our jobs.</v>

602
00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:20.790
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

603
00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:20.950
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

604
00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:21.551
<v Speaker 4>you can go on,</v>

605
00:15:21.551 --> 00:15:23.560
<v Speaker 4>have fucked up and have a great set.</v>

606
00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:28.620
<v Speaker 4>I can go on drunk and not even remember to set and just go on wrote.</v>

607
00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:29.501
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

608
00:15:29.501 --> 00:15:30.370
<v Speaker 4>I hate to do that,</v>

609
00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:31.001
<v Speaker 4>but if I have,</v>

610
00:15:31.001 --> 00:15:34.850
<v Speaker 4>I've done so much standup that I could get.</v>

611
00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:35.600
<v Speaker 4>I literally,</v>

612
00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:37.190
<v Speaker 6>I don't even really from a Hammock,</v>

613
00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:39.170
<v Speaker 6>I never,</v>

614
00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:39.650
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

615
00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:42.400
<v Speaker 6>I remember watching people when I was younger,</v>

616
00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:46.760
<v Speaker 6>phone it in and we've all seen guys phone it in where they're not really</v>

617
00:15:46.761 --> 00:15:49.890
<v Speaker 6>engaging in what they're saying and not really thinking about it.</v>

618
00:15:49.891 --> 00:15:50.930
<v Speaker 6>And I don't like to do that.</v>

619
00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:51.800
<v Speaker 6>It's weird.</v>

620
00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:52.910
<v Speaker 6>It's weird when you see it,</v>

621
00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:53.300
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

622
00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:54.350
<v Speaker 6>it's weird when you see it.</v>

623
00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:56.180
<v Speaker 6>And it's weird when it happens to you too,</v>

624
00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:59.240
<v Speaker 6>and maybe sometimes it doesn't always happen to you on PR,</v>

625
00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:03.530
<v Speaker 6>like especially starting out and developing like along the way you kind of like</v>

626
00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:04.730
<v Speaker 6>realize like,</v>

627
00:16:04.731 --> 00:16:06.050
<v Speaker 6>well that's set went great.</v>

628
00:16:06.051 --> 00:16:07.100
<v Speaker 6>What did I do different?</v>

629
00:16:07.101 --> 00:16:08.420
<v Speaker 6>And this set didn't go as good.</v>

630
00:16:08.421 --> 00:16:09.350
<v Speaker 6>What did I do wrong?</v>

631
00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:12.160
<v Speaker 6>But I remember Rah Ray Romano got offset it.</v>

632
00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:12.490
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

633
00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:12.690
<v Speaker 6>we,</v>

634
00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:14.540
<v Speaker 6>I worked with him at Jimmy's comedy alley.</v>

635
00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:15.760
<v Speaker 6>[inaudible] said,</v>

636
00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:16.480
<v Speaker 6>I love that place.</v>

637
00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:16.730
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

638
00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:19.100
<v Speaker 6>I middled for Ray Romano back in the day.</v>

639
00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:20.073
<v Speaker 6>It was awesome.</v>

640
00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:21.470
<v Speaker 6>He was a great guy too.</v>

641
00:16:21.471 --> 00:16:22.191
<v Speaker 6>What does a great guy,</v>

642
00:16:22.191 --> 00:16:23.480
<v Speaker 6>he's such a sweetheart.</v>

643
00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:25.250
<v Speaker 6>He hates to follow anybody's drunk,</v>

644
00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:26.810
<v Speaker 6>but he was great about it though.</v>

645
00:16:26.811 --> 00:16:27.980
<v Speaker 6>He was so funny,</v>

646
00:16:27.981 --> 00:16:28.281
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

647
00:16:28.281 --> 00:16:29.820
<v Speaker 6>He was so goddamn good.</v>

648
00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:30.291
<v Speaker 6>But anyway,</v>

649
00:16:30.291 --> 00:16:31.130
<v Speaker 6>he got off stage.</v>

650
00:16:31.131 --> 00:16:31.431
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

651
00:16:31.431 --> 00:16:33.860
<v Speaker 6>he just crushed for 45 minutes.</v>

652
00:16:33.861 --> 00:16:35.330
<v Speaker 6>I absolutely destroyed.</v>

653
00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:39.080
<v Speaker 6>And then he got off to a job wound that was about the most autopilot I've ever</v>

654
00:16:39.081 --> 00:16:39.470
<v Speaker 6>been.</v>

655
00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:41.570
<v Speaker 6>Really just walked right through that one.</v>

656
00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:43.700
<v Speaker 6>It's like he just,</v>

657
00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:44.241
<v Speaker 6>he goes,</v>

658
00:16:44.241 --> 00:16:46.310
<v Speaker 6>I totally found it in and they fucking bought it.</v>

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:48.500
<v Speaker 6>It was hilarious.</v>

662

00:17:16.161 --> 00:17:17.030
<v Speaker 6>I didn't know that you talked to</v>

695
00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:18.470
<v Speaker 4>that and you know,</v>

696
00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:19.101
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

697
00:17:19.101 --> 00:17:19.934
<v Speaker 4>of course.</v>

698
00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:20.870
<v Speaker 4>I don't give a fuck.</v>

699
00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:21.651
<v Speaker 4>Do you give a fuck?</v>

700
00:17:21.651 --> 00:17:22.310
<v Speaker 4>I didn't like,</v>

701
00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:22.611
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

702
00:17:22.611 --> 00:17:24.230
<v Speaker 4>I don't care if I tell you what I took.</v>

703
00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:29.320
<v Speaker 4>I did a bit that Johnny Sanchez did and I knew that I had to have heard it</v>

704
00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:32.960
<v Speaker 4>subconsciously because I swear to God and Johnny knows me.</v>

705
00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:34.160
<v Speaker 4>He knows I wouldn't take it,</v>

706
00:17:34.161 --> 00:17:39.161
<v Speaker 4>but it was too specific was about Mesopotamia and Persia and Babylonia.</v>

707
00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:43.100
<v Speaker 4>Like it had too many rings to it that I thought John,</v>

708
00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:43.701
<v Speaker 4>he goes,</v>

709
00:17:43.701 --> 00:17:43.881
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

710
00:17:43.881 --> 00:17:44.211
<v Speaker 4>do it.</v>

711
00:17:44.211 --> 00:17:44.510
<v Speaker 4>Like go,</v>

712
00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:45.410
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to do it.</v>

713
00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:49.090
<v Speaker 4>Cause I know I had to like I could've been sitting upstairs the laugh factory,</v>

714
00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:50.400
<v Speaker 4>not even paying attention.</v>

715
00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:52.230
<v Speaker 1>Heard it in my mind.</v>

716
00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:52.891
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

717
00:17:52.891 --> 00:17:55.590
<v Speaker 1>That's the dangerous somebody didn't cause sometimes it's not malicious.</v>

718
00:17:57.270 --> 00:18:00.600
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it's that weird thing where you're working with a guy and they have a</v>

719
00:18:00.601 --> 00:18:03.530
<v Speaker 1>bit that's on the same subject as your bed,</v>

720
00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:07.140
<v Speaker 1>but it's a different bit like all the sudden your friend has a time machine bit</v>

721
00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:08.160
<v Speaker 1>but old out of nowhere.</v>

722
00:18:08.161 --> 00:18:08.381
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

723
00:18:08.381 --> 00:18:08.670
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

724
00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:08.941
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

725
00:18:08.941 --> 00:18:09.271
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

726
00:18:09.271 --> 00:18:09.781
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

727
00:18:09.781 --> 00:18:10.141
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

728
00:18:10.141 --> 00:18:11.220
<v Speaker 1>Well that's not my bed.</v>

729
00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:11.641
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

730
00:18:11.641 --> 00:18:12.360
<v Speaker 1>Yours is a def.</v>

731
00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:13.260
<v Speaker 1>Definitely a different bit,</v>

732
00:18:13.261 --> 00:18:16.190
<v Speaker 1>but you're going to do a time machine bit right before I do a time machine bit</v>

733
00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:16.710
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

734
00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:17.071
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

735
00:18:17.071 --> 00:18:19.560
<v Speaker 1>I've seen that on the road where you have the Middle Act to do,</v>

736
00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:20.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to lack the next night.</v>

737
00:18:20.641 --> 00:18:22.620
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden has same subject matter.</v>

738
00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:25.000
<v Speaker 1>He wrote anything on your material,</v>

739
00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:25.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

740
00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:26.601
<v Speaker 1>guys who,</v>

741
00:18:26.601 --> 00:18:26.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

742
00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:28.500
<v Speaker 1>open for you when they're doing that shit.</v>

743
00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:29.790
<v Speaker 1>It's so gross,</v>

744
00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:30.840
<v Speaker 1>so transparent,</v>

745
00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:31.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

746
00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:33.330
<v Speaker 1>and I hate to tell people what to do,</v>

747
00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:33.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

748
00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:34.770
<v Speaker 1>before the subject matter.</v>

749
00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:35.570
<v Speaker 1>I feel like so,</v>

750
00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:36.270
<v Speaker 1>but you can't,</v>

751
00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:36.860
<v Speaker 1>you cannot,</v>

752
00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:37.660
<v Speaker 1>it's just to you,</v>

753
00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:38.131
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

754
00:18:38.131 --> 00:18:40.710
<v Speaker 1>when someone's got actual bits and you know,</v>

755
00:18:40.711 --> 00:18:43.590
<v Speaker 1>when someone is just trying to step on a step on the subject matter,</v>

756
00:18:43.591 --> 00:18:46.290
<v Speaker 1>it's a weird thing that people do when they get competitive with the other acts</v>

757
00:18:46.291 --> 00:18:47.124
<v Speaker 1>that they're working with.</v>

758
00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:49.140
<v Speaker 1>And it just ruins the whole vibe.</v>

759
00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:51.960
<v Speaker 1>Like if you go on the road with people and everybody's having a good time and</v>

760
00:18:51.961 --> 00:18:53.430
<v Speaker 1>everybody wants everybody else to do well,</v>

761
00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:57.930
<v Speaker 1>that's like a great feeling when you're working with a guy and he wants you to</v>

762
00:18:57.931 --> 00:18:58.321
<v Speaker 1>eat it.</v>

763
00:18:58.321 --> 00:19:00.150
<v Speaker 1>And so he's trying to like bury you.</v>

764
00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:01.830
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to do shit to burry you.</v>

765
00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:03.060
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird feeling.</v>

766
00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:04.370
<v Speaker 1>Even imagine that way.</v>

767
00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:07.710
<v Speaker 1>I won't guy that did that to me.</v>

768
00:19:07.711 --> 00:19:08.544
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

769
00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:12.780
<v Speaker 1>And a New Jersey and he just kept trying to fuck me and I could tell,</v>

770
00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:13.710
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

771
00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:14.070
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

772
00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:14.191
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

773
00:19:14.191 --> 00:19:15.360
<v Speaker 1>that's the area for it.</v>

774
00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:15.841
<v Speaker 1>I had,</v>

775
00:19:15.841 --> 00:19:16.680
<v Speaker 1>mine was in Philly,</v>

776
00:19:16.681 --> 00:19:18.300
<v Speaker 1>my worst case examples in Philly.</v>

777
00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:23.840
<v Speaker 1>I had this whole bit about Madonna and this dude did the bit in front of me and</v>

778
00:19:24.571 --> 00:19:26.070
<v Speaker 1>use Janet Jackson.</v>

779
00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:26.820
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

780
00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:28.650
<v Speaker 1>like did the exact same bit.</v>

781
00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:30.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was the same number.</v>

782
00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:33.090
<v Speaker 1>You called her a whore in it.</v>

783
00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:33.690
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

784
00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:34.070
<v Speaker 1>a tall,</v>

785
00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:35.040
<v Speaker 1>beautiful human being.</v>

786
00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:35.230
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

787
00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:35.581
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

788
00:19:35.581 --> 00:19:36.630
<v Speaker 1>We're called the wrong bit.</v>

789
00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:37.290
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

790
00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:37.591
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

791
00:19:37.591 --> 00:19:38.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

792
00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:40.380
<v Speaker 1>it was just about watching the videos.</v>

793
00:19:40.381 --> 00:19:41.250
<v Speaker 1>A stupid joke.</v>

794
00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:43.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't even remember the exact wording of it.</v>

795
00:19:43.021 --> 00:19:47.190
<v Speaker 1>And watching a video on Madonna video while my girlfriend was in the room and</v>

796
00:19:47.191 --> 00:19:48.770
<v Speaker 1>having to feel dumb questions.</v>

797
00:19:48.790 --> 00:19:51.000
<v Speaker 1>Like if you had to choose our enemy,</v>

798
00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:51.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

799
00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:52.140
<v Speaker 1>Jack,</v>

800
00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:53.190
<v Speaker 1>I want you to be honest.</v>

801
00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:54.361
<v Speaker 1>And they choke.</v>

802
00:19:54.361 --> 00:19:59.160
<v Speaker 1>It's like I would fuck her in front of you over your mother's house on the</v>

803
00:19:59.161 --> 00:20:01.620
<v Speaker 1>kitchen table with her ass and your corn flakes.</v>

804
00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:03.300
<v Speaker 1>So it was a stupid joke,</v>

805
00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:08.080
<v Speaker 1>but this dude had the exact same joke the next day with Janet Jackson.</v>

806
00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:08.371
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

807
00:20:08.371 --> 00:20:09.360
<v Speaker 1>well that's crazy.</v>

808
00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:10.860
<v Speaker 1>Like you just stole that joke.</v>

809
00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:11.461
<v Speaker 1>And it was,</v>

810
00:20:11.461 --> 00:20:12.140
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know,</v>

811
00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:12.601
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

812
00:20:12.601 --> 00:20:13.291
<v Speaker 1>back in the day,</v>

813
00:20:13.291 --> 00:20:14.740
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really know exactly how it,</v>

814
00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:15.840
<v Speaker 1>how you dealt with that.</v>

815
00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:17.730
<v Speaker 1>I had enough material that it didn't matter.</v>

816
00:20:17.731 --> 00:20:18.570
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have to do it.</v>

817
00:20:18.571 --> 00:20:20.250
<v Speaker 1>It was like already phasing that bit out.</v>

818
00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:21.390
<v Speaker 1>But I thought it was crazy.</v>

819
00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:23.730
<v Speaker 1>This guy had like two or three bits.</v>

820
00:20:23.731 --> 00:20:26.880
<v Speaker 1>All of the sudden they were on the same subjects and one of them was like</v>

821
00:20:26.881 --> 00:20:30.480
<v Speaker 1>basically the same exact joke and just reworded it.</v>

822
00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:33.360
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever throw something away and somebody picks it up and runs with it?</v>

823
00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:37.830
<v Speaker 1>I had like a thing where I was talking about I'm not a racist unless I'm in</v>

824
00:20:37.831 --> 00:20:38.664
<v Speaker 1>traffic,</v>

825
00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:39.900
<v Speaker 1>then I become a racist,</v>

826
00:20:39.901 --> 00:20:40.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

827
00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:41.820
<v Speaker 1>it's gotta be a fucking Chink in front of me.</v>

828
00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:44.820
<v Speaker 1>I know it's gotta be a chink broad.</v>

829
00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:45.660
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

830
00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:46.493
<v Speaker 1>And I drive with,</v>

831
00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:47.900
<v Speaker 1>see it is,</v>

832
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:48.813
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

833
00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:51.110
<v Speaker 2>why would you ever throw that away?</v>

834
00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:51.611
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

835
00:20:51.611 --> 00:20:51.711
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

836
00:20:51.711 --> 00:20:51.920
<v Speaker 2>Gee,</v>

837
00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:52.670
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

838
00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:53.503
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>

839
00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:55.000
<v Speaker 2>there's an act at the,</v>

840
00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:55.560
<v Speaker 2>at the,</v>

841
00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:55.850
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

842
00:20:55.850 --> 00:20:56.601
<v Speaker 2>plant factor now.</v>

843
00:20:56.601 --> 00:21:00.780
<v Speaker 2>His whole first five minutes is about that in a racist and traffic.</v>

844
00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:01.150
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

845
00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:01.481
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

846
00:21:01.481 --> 00:21:02.800
<v Speaker 1>And he heard you talk about this.</v>

847
00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:03.843
<v Speaker 1>He had to hear it.</v>

848
00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:04.300
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

849
00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:05.390
<v Speaker 1>that's really pathetic.</v>

850
00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:07.180
<v Speaker 1>Pathetically like motivated.</v>

851
00:21:07.181 --> 00:21:08.230
<v Speaker 1>I've seen guys do that.</v>

852
00:21:08.231 --> 00:21:11.950
<v Speaker 1>I've seen guys take a bit that someone else said in a conversation and all of a</v>

853
00:21:11.951 --> 00:21:12.784
<v Speaker 1>sudden they,</v>

854
00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:13.180
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

855
00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:14.800
<v Speaker 1>what they don't understand is that a lot of times,</v>

856
00:21:14.801 --> 00:21:16.450
<v Speaker 1>like when you say something in conversation,</v>

857
00:21:16.451 --> 00:21:19.140
<v Speaker 1>you might have already said it on stage or you,</v>

858
00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:19.361
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

859
00:21:19.361 --> 00:21:21.550
<v Speaker 1>if you have like a point of view on something,</v>

860
00:21:21.551 --> 00:21:24.160
<v Speaker 1>it might be something you've already been working on for a long time.</v>

861
00:21:24.161 --> 00:21:26.770
<v Speaker 1>And if you lay out the premise like that to a guy,</v>

862
00:21:26.771 --> 00:21:27.640
<v Speaker 1>like that's,</v>

863
00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:29.890
<v Speaker 1>it's just as bad as stealing material.</v>

864
00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:30.400
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

865
00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:31.090
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

866
00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:32.290
<v Speaker 1>some things you can't steal.</v>

867
00:21:32.291 --> 00:21:34.780
<v Speaker 1>Like when you were doing the two bits about your daughter,</v>

868
00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:37.000
<v Speaker 1>it's so vivid.</v>

869
00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:38.710
<v Speaker 1>Like you can see that that's a,</v>

870
00:21:38.711 --> 00:21:38.911
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

871
00:21:38.911 --> 00:21:39.010
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

872
00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:39.431
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

873
00:21:39.431 --> 00:21:40.264
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to tell you that.</v>

874
00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:41.590
<v Speaker 2>That's what makes it so funny,</v>

875
00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:46.950
<v Speaker 2>but it's like perfectly executed in the sense that you see her and you see you</v>

876
00:21:47.831 --> 00:21:48.250
<v Speaker 2>and hear you.</v>

877
00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:49.083
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

878
00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:49.440
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

879
00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:50.380
<v Speaker 2>not just the banana thing,</v>

880
00:21:50.381 --> 00:21:55.150
<v Speaker 2>but the second thing is fucking hilarious because it brings you in to something</v>

881
00:21:55.151 --> 00:21:55.450
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

882
00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:59.080
<v Speaker 2>that's what people hopefully can't steal is your essence and your,</v>

883
00:21:59.110 --> 00:21:59.943
<v Speaker 2>your own,</v>

884
00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:00.641
<v Speaker 2>your own life.</v>

885
00:22:00.641 --> 00:22:00.821
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

886
00:22:00.821 --> 00:22:02.650
<v Speaker 2>if somebody starts talking about my cousin Johnny,</v>

887
00:22:02.651 --> 00:22:03.640
<v Speaker 2>I know they stole from me.</v>

888
00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:05.500
<v Speaker 2>I know they can fuck around and dance around.</v>

889
00:22:05.501 --> 00:22:05.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

890
00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:06.443
<v Speaker 1>Shit but,</v>

891
00:22:06.530 --> 00:22:11.530
<v Speaker 1>but this is a weird thing with being influenced by people versus stealing from</v>

892
00:22:12.001 --> 00:22:13.610
<v Speaker 1>people because yeah,</v>

893
00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:16.500
<v Speaker 1>we're all influence is like we didn't get here on our own.</v>

894
00:22:16.501 --> 00:22:17.430
<v Speaker 1>None of us get her on her own.</v>

895
00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:19.210
<v Speaker 1>I think what we would,</v>

896
00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:23.040
<v Speaker 1>everybody is always concerned with though is like the honesty of where these</v>

897
00:22:23.041 --> 00:22:24.120
<v Speaker 1>ideas are coming from.</v>

898
00:22:24.121 --> 00:22:26.190
<v Speaker 1>Like you're taking ideas from other people.</v>

899
00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:30.540
<v Speaker 1>The whole vibe of what you're doing is completely different because they're like</v>

900
00:22:30.541 --> 00:22:32.220
<v Speaker 1>the vibe of a standup comedian.</v>

901
00:22:32.221 --> 00:22:36.270
<v Speaker 1>Like what I love about say a guy like you when you're on stage and you're killin</v>

902
00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:41.630
<v Speaker 1>is I know that this is your mind putting all this together.</v>

903
00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:47.300
<v Speaker 1>I know this is like any individual's point of view and expression and I lock</v>

904
00:22:47.821 --> 00:22:50.460
<v Speaker 1>into it and have a great time with your thoughts.</v>

905
00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:55.610
<v Speaker 1>But as soon as I think that you're just parroting someone else's words,</v>

906
00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:58.230
<v Speaker 1>as soon as I think that this isn't something that you've absorbed,</v>

907
00:22:58.231 --> 00:22:59.700
<v Speaker 1>this isn't a part of you as a human,</v>

908
00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:00.211
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

909
00:23:00.211 --> 00:23:01.530
<v Speaker 1>these aren't your actual thoughts.</v>

910
00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:03.120
<v Speaker 1>These aren't your actual conclusions.</v>

911
00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:03.361
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

912
00:23:03.361 --> 00:23:05.250
<v Speaker 1>This is just you saying some shit.</v>

913
00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:06.900
<v Speaker 1>Well then you lose,</v>

914
00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:09.340
<v Speaker 1>you lose a big chunk of that connection then.</v>

915
00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:10.050
<v Speaker 1>Then you,</v>

916
00:23:10.050 --> 00:23:11.910
<v Speaker 1>then we have a bullshit relationship.</v>

917
00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:13.020
<v Speaker 1>There's no soul to it.</v>

918
00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:17.340
<v Speaker 1>I was watching a guy last week and he really was stuck in the 80s and really</v>

919
00:23:17.341 --> 00:23:17.750
<v Speaker 1>stuck,</v>

920
00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:18.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

921
00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:20.820
<v Speaker 1>for witness without being able to budge and he was just doing,</v>

922
00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:21.750
<v Speaker 1>he had nothing,</v>

923
00:23:21.751 --> 00:23:22.584
<v Speaker 1>had any heart too.</v>

924
00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:24.150
<v Speaker 1>It was just like,</v>

925
00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:25.680
<v Speaker 1>it Kinda like Rodney did.</v>

926
00:23:25.681 --> 00:23:28.050
<v Speaker 1>It's so extreme that it was funny.</v>

927
00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:29.820
<v Speaker 1>You knew that it was a character.</v>

928
00:23:29.821 --> 00:23:32.460
<v Speaker 1>You knew it was jokes and it was funny because his character is so brilliant.</v>

929
00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:34.860
<v Speaker 1>This guy was trying to act like it was him,</v>

930
00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:36.390
<v Speaker 1>but it was jokey jokes.</v>

931
00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:37.231
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what I mean?</v>

932
00:23:37.231 --> 00:23:38.580
<v Speaker 1>It was bizarre and I thought,</v>

933
00:23:38.581 --> 00:23:38.990
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

934
00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:40.160
<v Speaker 2>would you put that away?</v>

935
00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:43.700
<v Speaker 2>What happened is a video of me and I was like 20 years old.</v>

936
00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:44.690
<v Speaker 2>This is so crazy.</v>

937
00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:45.440
<v Speaker 2>Somebody just like,</v>

938
00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:46.170

939
00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:48.080

940
00:23:48.081 --> 00:23:48.460
<v Speaker 7>So I'm like,</v>

941
00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:51.400
<v Speaker 7>I wonder if I can find that clip and I just hold it up.</v>

949
00:24:02.490 --> 00:24:03.210
<v Speaker 1>Flexibility.</v>

950
00:24:03.210 --> 00:24:03.840

956
00:24:08.421 --> 00:24:09.390
<v Speaker 1>It's probably terrible though.</v>

957
00:24:09.391 --> 00:24:09.901
<v Speaker 1>Whatever it is.</v>

958
00:24:09.901 --> 00:24:11.220

00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:15.241
<v Speaker 7>Do not.</v>

962
00:24:15.241 --> 00:24:16.600
<v Speaker 7>Last thing I want to hear is my oldest</v>

<v Speaker 7>fuck outta here with that here a minute.</v>

964
00:24:22.850 --> 00:24:24.350
<v Speaker 1>One minute and go to Google.</v>

965
00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:26.090
<v Speaker 1>Go Youtube it yourself.</v>

966
00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:27.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't listen to myself,</v>

967
00:24:27.891 --> 00:24:28.310
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

968
00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:29.143
<v Speaker 1>The last thing,</v>

969
00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:30.801
<v Speaker 1>even my special,</v>

970
00:24:30.801 --> 00:24:32.780
<v Speaker 1>like I didn't listen to it until last week.</v>

971
00:24:33.210 --> 00:24:35.570
<v Speaker 1>I would like a a day to,</v>

972
00:24:35.571 --> 00:24:35.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

973
00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:39.330
<v Speaker 1>to edit it and I watched it for the first time that night.</v>

974
00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:40.813
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

975
00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:42.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't like watching myself.</v>

976
00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:42.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't either.</v>

977
00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:43.400
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

978
00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:47.360
<v Speaker 1>I do it for the purposes of working on material.</v>

979
00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:51.650
<v Speaker 1>Like I'll listen to the recordings and I do learn shit when I watch myself.</v>

980
00:24:51.651 --> 00:24:52.310
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>

981
00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:53.690
<v Speaker 1>what I think is more effective,</v>

982
00:24:53.691 --> 00:24:56.960
<v Speaker 1>like what pauses are more effective or moves and more effective,</v>

983
00:24:56.961 --> 00:24:57.470
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

984
00:24:57.470 --> 00:24:58.810
<v Speaker 1>and you can incorporate what you,</v>

985
00:24:58.811 --> 00:25:00.200
<v Speaker 1>you figure it out from watching yourself.</v>

986
00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:01.370
<v Speaker 1>But it's like,</v>

987
00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:05.540
<v Speaker 1>it takes away from a lot of the fun of the improvisation of it all.</v>

988
00:25:05.541 --> 00:25:06.374
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

989
00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:07.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to watch myself.</v>

990
00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:10.490
<v Speaker 1>Do you mind if we watch?</v>

991
00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:11.460
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

992
00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:12.930
<v Speaker 7>Well you might step it out for a minute.</v>

993
00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:14.920
<v Speaker 7>I cannot wait to watch it.</v>

994
00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:16.420
<v Speaker 7>I just,</v>

995
00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:17.520
<v Speaker 7>I'd never seen that before.</v>

996
00:25:17.521 --> 00:25:18.820
<v Speaker 7>You kill up in Montreal.</v>

997
00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:21.390
<v Speaker 1>Dom and I became friends because,</v>

998
00:25:21.391 --> 00:25:21.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

999
00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:22.381

1003
00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:25.221
<v Speaker 1>What was,</v>

1004
00:25:25.221 --> 00:25:26.640
<v Speaker 1>it might've been called the danger zone.</v>

1005
00:25:26.670 --> 00:25:28.730
<v Speaker 1>Danger zone from the danger zone or something like that.</v>

1006
00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:29.610
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1007

1008
00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:33.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1009
00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:34.940
<v Speaker 1>And that was the first time I met you with it.</v>

1010
00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:35.191
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1012
00:25:37.681 --> 00:25:38.430
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

1013
00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:39.263
<v Speaker 1>I think I did.</v>

1014
00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:43.230
<v Speaker 1>He did MTV half hour comedy hour before that and then I,</v>

1015
00:25:43.231 --> 00:25:45.360
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't really care about that one cause I couldn't swear.</v>

1016
00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:45.961
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1017
00:25:45.961 --> 00:25:47.430
<v Speaker 1>so I want to do a real one.</v>

1018
00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:52.460
<v Speaker 1>That was like my first real set and then dom and I met again an Amsterdam</v>

1019
00:25:52.891 --> 00:25:54.450
<v Speaker 1>billiards and that's when we fell in love.</v>

1020
00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:56.580
<v Speaker 1>Yet we found out that we played pool.</v>

1021
00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:58.650
<v Speaker 1>Dom and I played pool.</v>

1022
00:25:58.651 --> 00:26:03.651
<v Speaker 1>We were regulars at a set of established that will remain unnamed.</v>

1023
00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:04.713
<v Speaker 7>Look at that guy,</v>

1024
00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:09.560
<v Speaker 7>young chap from 19 it's like I got a wig on it.</v>

1025
00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:10.870
<v Speaker 7>Look at the fucking moves.</v>

1026
00:26:10.871 --> 00:26:14.530
<v Speaker 7>He's got stomach three it'd be 64 inches long.</v>

1027
00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:16.773
<v Speaker 7>I don't even remember that.</v>

1028
00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:22.060
<v Speaker 7>Right about this guy.</v>

1029
00:26:22.061 --> 00:26:24.220
<v Speaker 7>He got hit by two trains in one day.</v>

1030
00:26:27.390 --> 00:26:27.821
<v Speaker 7>Listen,</v>

<v Speaker 7>listen,</v>

1032
00:26:28.181 --> 00:26:29.200
<v Speaker 7>we don't have to do that to you.</v>

1033
00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:34.650
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it weird like seeing a recorded version of yourself?</v>

1034
00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:39.810
<v Speaker 1>I was like 50 pounds lighter with the big head of hair.</v>

1035
00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:40.920
<v Speaker 1>Dom Irrera listen.</v>

1036
00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:43.670
<v Speaker 1>Well we need to do is get you a podcast first of all.</v>

00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:46.690
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

1041
00:26:46.690 --> 00:26:47.200
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

1042
00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:47.501
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

1043
00:26:47.501 --> 00:26:48.220
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

1044
00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:48.610
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

1045
00:26:48.610 --> 00:26:49.443
<v Speaker 1>let me finish.</v>

1046
00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:50.950
<v Speaker 1>When you have a podcast,</v>

1047
00:26:50.951 --> 00:26:55.951
<v Speaker 1>what I'm saying is we need to get you a podcast that just deals with you not</v>

1048
00:26:56.921 --> 00:26:57.754
<v Speaker 1>drinking.</v>

1049
00:26:57.970 --> 00:26:58.391
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

1050
00:26:58.391 --> 00:27:01.480
<v Speaker 1>I'll podcasts where you just,</v>

1051
00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:03.880
<v Speaker 1>you get all or any,</v>

1052
00:27:03.881 --> 00:27:07.210
<v Speaker 1>any like momentum you have,</v>

1053
00:27:07.211 --> 00:27:09.430
<v Speaker 1>any motivation that you have to drink,</v>

1054
00:27:09.431 --> 00:27:12.070
<v Speaker 1>any like release a podcast about it.</v>

1055
00:27:12.250 --> 00:27:15.580
<v Speaker 1>Release a podcast about why you want to go have a drink or why you don't want to</v>

1056
00:27:15.581 --> 00:27:16.390
<v Speaker 1>have a drink.</v>

1057
00:27:16.390 --> 00:27:20.860
<v Speaker 1>And I think people would be absolutely fascinated by the struggle of it all.</v>

1058
00:27:20.861 --> 00:27:22.150
<v Speaker 1>Cause you're very open about it.</v>

1059
00:27:22.151 --> 00:27:23.170
<v Speaker 1>You're very honest about it.</v>

1060
00:27:23.171 --> 00:27:26.530
<v Speaker 1>Every time you've come on the podcast when you haven't drank and you were</v>

1061
00:27:26.531 --> 00:27:29.080
<v Speaker 1>telling me how great your field and then now you're like,</v>

1062
00:27:29.081 --> 00:27:29.260
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

1063
00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:30.580
<v Speaker 1>it's too fucking fun shit.</v>

1064
00:27:30.650 --> 00:27:31.483
<v Speaker 2>I'll be your cohost.</v>

1065
00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:32.880
<v Speaker 2>And I try not to judge told the,</v>

1066
00:27:32.881 --> 00:27:33.051
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1067
00:27:33.051 --> 00:27:37.580
<v Speaker 2>like in a young Frankenstein when gene wilder says no matter what,</v>

1068
00:27:37.581 --> 00:27:39.620
<v Speaker 2>I say don't do not open that door.</v>

1069
00:27:39.621 --> 00:27:41.300
<v Speaker 2>And he walks in to talk to the monster.</v>

1070
00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:41.830
<v Speaker 2>Remember that?</v>

1071
00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:42.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1072
00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:42.741
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1073
00:27:42.741 --> 00:27:45.350
<v Speaker 2>I said to Noel last night at the laugh factory said,</v>

1074
00:27:45.351 --> 00:27:46.610
<v Speaker 2>do not give me a drink,</v>

1075
00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:47.421
<v Speaker 2>another drink.</v>

1076
00:27:47.421 --> 00:27:48.710
<v Speaker 2>Are there any circumstances?</v>

1077
00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:50.900
<v Speaker 2>I come back 10 minutes later I'll take another drink.</v>

1078
00:27:50.901 --> 00:27:51.390
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

1079
00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:52.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what to do.</v>

1080
00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:53.480
<v Speaker 2>You just told me that to give it to.</v>

1081
00:27:53.481 --> 00:27:53.780
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1082
00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:54.411
<v Speaker 2>forget about what?</v>

1083
00:27:54.411 --> 00:27:55.010
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1084
00:27:55.010 --> 00:27:55.970
<v Speaker 2>don't you gotta listen to me.</v>

1085
00:27:55.971 --> 00:27:56.804
<v Speaker 2>I'm a drunk.</v>

1086
00:27:57.730 --> 00:27:58.481
<v Speaker 1>You can't.</v>

1087
00:27:58.481 --> 00:27:59.314
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1088
00:27:59.440 --> 00:27:59.950
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1089
00:27:59.950 --> 00:28:04.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can't keep like seesaw on like that and I think maybe doing a podcast</v>

1090
00:28:04.631 --> 00:28:07.090
<v Speaker 1>would be a good catharsis.</v>

1091
00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:07.451
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1092
00:28:07.451 --> 00:28:12.451
<v Speaker 1>a good sort of a method to try to stay sober if you really want to.</v>

1093
00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:13.271
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1094
00:28:13.271 --> 00:28:14.260
<v Speaker 1>if you don't want to look,</v>

1095
00:28:14.290 --> 00:28:14.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1096
00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:17.530
<v Speaker 1>I would never try to go to Stan hope and tell him a sober up.</v>

1097
00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:18.671
<v Speaker 1>She hasn't.</v>

1098
00:28:18.671 --> 00:28:20.110
<v Speaker 1>Why can't imagine him sober?</v>

1099
00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:21.100
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't want to do it.</v>

1100
00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:22.120
<v Speaker 1>If he wanted any.</v>

1101
00:28:22.121 --> 00:28:23.230
<v Speaker 1>And if you wanted to do it,</v>

1102
00:28:23.231 --> 00:28:23.770
<v Speaker 1>he could do it.</v>

1103
00:28:23.770 --> 00:28:24.940
<v Speaker 1>He can do it anytime he wanted to.</v>

1104
00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:25.330
<v Speaker 1>He could.</v>

1105
00:28:25.330 --> 00:28:26.770
<v Speaker 1>He could do it tomorrow if you want it to.</v>

1106
00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:27.701
<v Speaker 1>He couldn't.</v>

1107
00:28:27.701 --> 00:28:29.770
<v Speaker 1>Mitch Hedberg was the one I tried to reach out to.</v>

1108
00:28:30.130 --> 00:28:30.580
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1109
00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:30.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1110
00:28:30.850 --> 00:28:31.541
<v Speaker 1>Because he,</v>

1111
00:28:31.541 --> 00:28:32.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1112
00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:32.771
<v Speaker 1>he was killing him,</v>

1113
00:28:32.771 --> 00:28:33.604
<v Speaker 1>so obviously,</v>

1114
00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:34.301
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>

1115
00:28:34.301 --> 00:28:34.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1116
00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:36.910
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know he was doing heroin well.</v>

1117
00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:37.773
<v Speaker 1>I was worried.</v>

1118
00:28:37.810 --> 00:28:40.510
<v Speaker 1>I think statistically heroin safer than alcohol.</v>

1119
00:28:40.810 --> 00:28:41.350
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1120
00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:42.183
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1121
00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:43.451
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1122
00:28:43.451 --> 00:28:44.284
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1123
00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:45.700
<v Speaker 1>I think alcohol is a,</v>

1124
00:28:45.701 --> 00:28:46.900
<v Speaker 1>it's a really dangerous shit.</v>

1125
00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:49.270
<v Speaker 1>We just don't think it's dangerous because it's everywhere.</v>

1126
00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:51.850
<v Speaker 1>It crushes your immune system,</v>

1127
00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:53.730
<v Speaker 1>but it also makes you feel great too.</v>

1128
00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:54.760
<v Speaker 1>I've got a couple of whiskeys,</v>

1129
00:28:54.770 --> 00:28:55.780
<v Speaker 1>senior sweet home.</v>

1130
00:28:55.781 --> 00:28:56.880
<v Speaker 1>Alabama comes on me.</v>

1131
00:28:57.660 --> 00:28:59.820
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the secret is going back to beer for me.</v>

1132
00:28:59.821 --> 00:29:01.080
<v Speaker 2>I think I need to just go,</v>

1133
00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:04.530
<v Speaker 2>I used to only drink beer then I just got on this Jack Daniels kick out of</v>

1134
00:29:04.531 --> 00:29:05.490
<v Speaker 2>nowhere and I'm just like,</v>

1135
00:29:05.491 --> 00:29:06.750
<v Speaker 2>why am I drinking so much jack?</v>

1136
00:29:06.751 --> 00:29:09.460
<v Speaker 2>I could through almost 75% of bottled and no,</v>

1137
00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:11.710
<v Speaker 2>I think gunfighter in the old west.</v>

1138
00:29:11.730 --> 00:29:11.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1139
00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:13.320
<v Speaker 2>I drink like whiskey now.</v>

1140
00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:14.480
<v Speaker 1>Me Too.</v>

1141
00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:15.313
<v Speaker 1>That was that about,</v>

1142
00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:16.610
<v Speaker 1>I like it.</v>

1143
00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:17.140
<v Speaker 1>I like it.</v>

1144
00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:18.230
<v Speaker 1>It makes me feel like I'm alive.</v>

1145
00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:20.030
<v Speaker 1>I love that feeling down your throat.</v>

1146
00:29:20.210 --> 00:29:21.043
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

1147
00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:21.561
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1148
00:29:21.561 --> 00:29:24.890
<v Speaker 1>I had a shot last weekend before I went on stage and Seattle.</v>

1149
00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:25.551

00:29:25.551 --> 00:29:26.480
<v Speaker 1>A parlor live,</v>

1151
00:29:26.481 --> 00:29:27.600
<v Speaker 1>if you have to do that place up there,</v>

1152
00:29:27.770 --> 00:29:28.940
<v Speaker 1>it's quick right club.</v>

<v Speaker 1>like a that like if you really wanted to hang out with somebody,</v>

1231
00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:18.311
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1232
00:31:18.311 --> 00:31:19.690
<v Speaker 1>if he was on a deserted island,</v>

1233
00:31:19.691 --> 00:31:20.890
<v Speaker 1>he would want it to be a woman.</v>

1234
00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.020
<v Speaker 1>Cause cause he gets fucking bored of talking to her.</v>

1235
00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:25.450
<v Speaker 1>You know he's not compatible like yeah.</v>

1236
00:31:25.451 --> 00:31:30.430
<v Speaker 1>If you want to be attracted to a woman like unfortunately for the male</v>

1237
00:31:30.431 --> 00:31:34.660
<v Speaker 1>reproductive system and we get our bodies get triggered by young fertile women.</v>

1238
00:31:35.330 --> 00:31:36.970
<v Speaker 1>It's an amazing hell interesting.</v>

1239
00:31:36.971 --> 00:31:40.540
<v Speaker 1>They'd become like a leave so stupid and I find it riveting.</v>

1242
00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:45.960
<v Speaker 1>It's just so crazy that are,</v>

1243
00:31:46.010 --> 00:31:49.610
<v Speaker 1>our bodies are like programmed to that where rationally your,</v>

1244
00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:50.740
<v Speaker 1>your consciousness,</v>

1245
00:31:50.890 --> 00:31:52.660
<v Speaker 1>the idea is like if we're going to evolve,</v>

1246
00:31:52.661 --> 00:31:54.970
<v Speaker 1>your consciousness should be able to look at that and go I have nothing in</v>

1247
00:31:54.971 --> 00:31:56.690
<v Speaker 1>common with his 23 year olds drive.</v>

1254
00:32:10.991 --> 00:32:14.280
<v Speaker 1>your body unfortunately wants that.</v>

1255
00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:16.390

00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:38.901
<v Speaker 4>They were all,</v>

1308
00:33:38.901 --> 00:33:39.560
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1309
00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:40.161
<v Speaker 4>citizens.</v>

1310
00:33:40.161 --> 00:33:41.020
<v Speaker 4>I was proud to say</v>

1311
00:33:42.650 --> 00:33:43.760
<v Speaker 4>not of the United States,</v>

1312
00:33:43.770 --> 00:33:47.630
<v Speaker 4>but do you feel bad for like a chick that has to date a comedian?</v>

1313
00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:48.620
<v Speaker 4>Like for the most part,</v>

1314
00:33:48.650 --> 00:33:52.160
<v Speaker 4>like why would you want to date crazy fucking comedian?</v>

1315
00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:56.180
<v Speaker 4>Because comedians are like some of the brightest people I've ever met.</v>

1316
00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:57.120
<v Speaker 4>So I think that,</v>

1317
00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:58.070
<v Speaker 4>see that's the difference.</v>

1318
00:33:58.380 --> 00:33:59.530
<v Speaker 4>We're just going back to,</v>

1319
00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:01.100
<v Speaker 4>they find that attractive.</v>

1320
00:34:01.130 --> 00:34:03.440
<v Speaker 4>You can get women because they are,</v>

1321
00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:04.160
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1322
00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:06.450
<v Speaker 4>they're just shallow in a different way there.</v>

1323
00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:06.860
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

1324
00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:07.280
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1325
00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:07.910
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

1326
00:34:07.910 --> 00:34:10.400
<v Speaker 4>they couldn't be with a guy who just a good guy,</v>

1327
00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:11.420
<v Speaker 4>they have to laugh,</v>

1328
00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:11.871
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1329
00:34:11.871 --> 00:34:12.580
<v Speaker 4>especially like,</v>

1330
00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:13.490
<v Speaker 4>like these models.</v>

1331
00:34:13.491 --> 00:34:17.150
<v Speaker 4>I remember working at the river cafe when I was parking cars and the models,</v>

1332
00:34:17.151 --> 00:34:19.580
<v Speaker 4>nobody asks them out because there were too fucking hot.</v>

1333
00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:20.360
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1334
00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:21.500
<v Speaker 4>So they were alone all the time,</v>

1335
00:34:22.070 --> 00:34:22.640
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1336
00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:23.390
<v Speaker 4>and like they,</v>

1337
00:34:23.390 --> 00:34:25.190
<v Speaker 4>nobody was attracted to them or no,</v>

1338
00:34:25.370 --> 00:34:26.600
<v Speaker 4>I guess people were afraid of them,</v>

1339
00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:27.440
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1340
00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:28.670
<v Speaker 4>they just didn't want to get shot down.</v>

1341
00:34:28.670 --> 00:34:29.470
<v Speaker 4>They didn't think they were.</v>

1342
00:34:29.470 --> 00:34:30.050
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1343
00:34:30.050 --> 00:34:32.110
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever been in that situation before where girls,</v>

1344
00:34:32.170 --> 00:34:34.730
<v Speaker 4>you just felt like a girl was too good for you and you couldn't even try?</v>

1345
00:34:35.110 --> 00:34:35.600
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1346
00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:36.680
<v Speaker 4>I'm that thick.</v>

1347
00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:37.400
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1348
00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:37.821
<v Speaker 4>never.</v>

1349
00:34:37.821 --> 00:34:38.700
<v Speaker 4>Even when you were in Denver,</v>

1350
00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:39.021
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1351
00:34:39.021 --> 00:34:44.021
<v Speaker 4>I tried everything and I've gotten girls way out of my league just being funny</v>

1352
00:34:44.871 --> 00:34:46.060
<v Speaker 4>and honesty.</v>

1353
00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:46.310
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1354
00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:48.890
<v Speaker 4>you've been a comedian for so fucking long to,</v>

1355
00:34:48.891 --> 00:34:50.500
<v Speaker 4>it's like you probably don't know her weight.</v>

1356
00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:57.250
<v Speaker 4>You probably don't remember what it's like to just be a out there in the free</v>

1357
00:34:57.561 --> 00:34:58.190
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>

1358
00:34:58.190 --> 00:34:58.670
<v Speaker 4>But I was,</v>

1359
00:34:58.670 --> 00:35:03.350
<v Speaker 4>I was like better looking then I was better as I got less good looking,</v>

1360
00:35:03.380 --> 00:35:03.920
<v Speaker 4>my,</v>

1361
00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:05.990
<v Speaker 4>I got richer and more famous.</v>

1362
00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:06.240
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1363
00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:06.620
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

1364
00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:08.120
<v Speaker 4>So it kind of balanced off,</v>

1365
00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:09.500
<v Speaker 4>you know what I'm saying?</v>

1366
00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:10.880
<v Speaker 4>If you go to like a third world country,</v>

1367
00:35:10.881 --> 00:35:14.630
<v Speaker 4>you'll press the Fuckos Kailand I'm big,</v>

1368
00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:15.800
<v Speaker 4>big dial in.</v>

1369
00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:17.180
<v Speaker 4>I think with the kids.</v>

1370
00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:20.150
<v Speaker 4>I enjoy it though.</v>

1371
00:35:20.151 --> 00:35:20.391
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1536
00:39:26.771 --> 00:39:27.131

<v Speaker 4>he didn't realize about you.</v>

1562
00:40:03.850 --> 00:40:05.680
<v Speaker 4>Write it down on a piece of paper and slide it over here.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I don't want to do that.</v>

1566
00:40:08.590 --> 00:40:09.423

00:40:38.531 --> 00:40:39.760
<v Speaker 4>let's call the crazy brother.</v>

1595
00:40:40.210 --> 00:40:41.170
<v Speaker 4>And the crazy one said,</v>

1596
00:40:41.171 --> 00:40:41.770
<v Speaker 4>don't go.</v>

1597
00:40:41.770 --> 00:40:42.071
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1598
00:40:42.071 --> 00:40:43.480
<v Speaker 4>You know what the issue is dumb.</v>

1599
00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:47.800
<v Speaker 4>It's like so far everything has been,</v>

1600
00:40:47.890 --> 00:40:49.430
<v Speaker 4>the casualties have been capped,</v>

1601
00:40:49.450 --> 00:40:51.880
<v Speaker 4>like at least mildly in check.</v>

1602
00:40:52.450 --> 00:40:55.570
<v Speaker 4>But it doesn't mean that someone can't do something fucking crazy.</v>

1603
00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:56.800
<v Speaker 4>And it might not happen.</v>

1604
00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:57.641
<v Speaker 4>And it might be,</v>

1605
00:40:57.641 --> 00:40:58.121
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1606
00:40:58.121 --> 00:41:01.930
<v Speaker 4>a few people die here and few people respond and die here and might be the way</v>

1607
00:41:01.931 --> 00:41:04.330
<v Speaker 4>it's coming on or might be an event.</v>

1608
00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:04.601
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1609
00:41:04.601 --> 00:41:06.460
<v Speaker 4>I'm totally sympathetic to these people too.</v>

1610
00:41:06.461 --> 00:41:11.170
<v Speaker 4>It's not like I do care and sterilely situations for refrigerator.</v>

1611
00:41:11.210 --> 00:41:11.370
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

1612
00:41:11.370 --> 00:41:13.540
<v Speaker 4>And I was afraid of not getting bombed.</v>

1613
00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:14.710
<v Speaker 4>That's so random.</v>

1614
00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:17.170
<v Speaker 4>I was afraid of the airport getting bombed and stucked yeah.</v>

1615
00:41:17.171 --> 00:41:19.410
<v Speaker 4>Getting stuck there and you have to think about that,</v>

1616
00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:21.880
<v Speaker 4>cause it's not like I can go to Damascus can catch a flight.</v>

1617
00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:22.661
<v Speaker 4>It's not like,</v>

1618
00:41:22.661 --> 00:41:22.871
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1619
00:41:22.871 --> 00:41:27.820
<v Speaker 4>if you're in Europe and they're an airline goes on Air France goes on strike,</v>

1620
00:41:27.821 --> 00:41:28.810
<v Speaker 4>you just drive to Spain.</v>

1621
00:41:28.930 --> 00:41:29.560
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1622
00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:31.000
<v Speaker 4>But it ain't like that in the Middle East.</v>

1623
00:41:31.001 --> 00:41:31.930
<v Speaker 4>It's not like that at all.</v>

1624
00:41:31.931 --> 00:41:35.030
<v Speaker 4>And that is one of the that people use.</v>

1625
00:41:35.031 --> 00:41:36.230
<v Speaker 4>If they're attacking a city,</v>

1626
00:41:36.231 --> 00:41:37.490
<v Speaker 4>they'll attack the airport.</v>

1627
00:41:37.491 --> 00:41:38.850
<v Speaker 4>So they keep us goods the,</v>

1628
00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:39.980
<v Speaker 4>anyways,</v>

1629
00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:40.760
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1630
00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:41.593
<v Speaker 4>that's what they do.</v>

1631
00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:42.740
<v Speaker 4>It's this is,</v>

1632
00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:43.821
<v Speaker 4>it's a very,</v>

1633
00:41:43.821 --> 00:41:45.350
<v Speaker 4>very volatile situation.</v>

1634
00:41:45.351 --> 00:41:47.300
<v Speaker 4>And you could have gone over there and you could have been fine.</v>

1635
00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:47.690
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

00:41:47.690 --> 00:41:49.130
<v Speaker 4>he could have got over there and you could have died.</v>

1637
00:41:49.210 --> 00:41:49.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1638
00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:52.070
<v Speaker 4>It's like that's reality in those parts of the world.</v>

1639
00:41:52.071 --> 00:41:57.071
<v Speaker 4>It's like we have this sort of a ridiculous notion that,</v>

1640
00:41:57.680 --> 00:41:57.920
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1641
00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:02.150
<v Speaker 4>because we're safe over here because a wood that we don't really have to think</v>

1642
00:42:02.151 --> 00:42:02.860
<v Speaker 4>about that shit too.</v>

1643
00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:02.960
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1644
00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:03.950
<v Speaker 4>the world is smaller now.</v>

1645
00:42:03.951 --> 00:42:05.660
<v Speaker 4>There was a time when it did mean a lot.</v>

1646
00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:06.410
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1647
00:42:06.410 --> 00:42:06.561
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1648
00:42:06.561 --> 00:42:08.570
<v Speaker 4>the fact that we were isolated over here,</v>

1649
00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:10.310
<v Speaker 4>away from Europe and Asia,</v>

1650
00:42:10.610 --> 00:42:10.791
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1651

1655
00:42:15.351 --> 00:42:15.680
<v Speaker 4>They would,</v>

1656
00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:17.630
<v Speaker 4>they could get inside people.</v>

1657
00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:19.720
<v Speaker 4>Terrorists could do something here if they want to do,</v>

00:44:03.591 --> 00:44:04.424
<v Speaker 4>I go back to my,</v>

1737
00:44:04.610 --> 00:44:05.160
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1738
00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:06.380
<v Speaker 4>sometimes it's fun.</v>

1739
00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:06.621
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

1740
00:44:06.621 --> 00:44:07.880
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying you shouldn't drink.</v>

1741
00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:08.571
<v Speaker 4>I love drink.</v>

1742
00:44:08.571 --> 00:44:08.691
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1743
00:44:08.691 --> 00:44:09.120
<v Speaker 4>but I,</v>

1744
00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:09.920
<v Speaker 4>I agree with,</v>

1745
00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:10.970
<v Speaker 4>but I don't do it every day.</v>

1746
00:44:10.980 --> 00:44:12.820
<v Speaker 4>But you're in a lot fucking better shape than me.</v>

1747
00:44:12.830 --> 00:44:13.011
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1748
00:44:13.011 --> 00:44:13.731
<v Speaker 4>you can drink.</v>

1749
00:44:13.731 --> 00:44:14.564
<v Speaker 4>I shouldn't drink.</v>

1750
00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:14.871
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1751
00:44:14.871 --> 00:44:15.441
<v Speaker 4>even me,</v>

1752
00:44:15.441 --> 00:44:16.160
<v Speaker 4>I feel it.</v>

1753
00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:18.950
<v Speaker 4>I feel it when I drank and I feel the difference in my body.</v>

1754
00:44:18.980 --> 00:44:20.120
<v Speaker 4>It's just not good for you.</v>

1755
00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:20.901
<v Speaker 4>It's not smart.</v>

1756
00:44:20.901 --> 00:44:21.411
<v Speaker 4>And I don't,</v>

1757
00:44:21.411 --> 00:44:22.280
<v Speaker 4>I don't have an issue with it.</v>

1758
00:44:22.281 --> 00:44:23.330
<v Speaker 4>I can take it or leave it.</v>

1759
00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:24.141
<v Speaker 4>I like it.</v>

1760
00:44:24.141 --> 00:44:24.531
<v Speaker 4>I like it.</v>

1761
00:44:24.531 --> 00:44:25.190
<v Speaker 4>Look with a meal.</v>

1762
00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:26.300
<v Speaker 4>I like some wine with a meal,</v>

1763
00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:28.130
<v Speaker 4>but I can take it or leave it.</v>

1764
00:44:28.170 --> 00:44:28.640
<v Speaker 4>What I,</v>

1765
00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:31.960
<v Speaker 4>what I think is important though is when you can't take something or leave it,</v>

1766
00:44:31.990 --> 00:44:33.100
<v Speaker 1>when you have to take it,</v>

1767
00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:35.820
<v Speaker 1>that's sort of a situation where you've got a really wore,</v>

1768
00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:35.951
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1769
00:44:35.951 --> 00:44:37.150
<v Speaker 1>what is this thing doing to me?</v>

1770
00:44:37.180 --> 00:44:39.190
<v Speaker 1>Is this thing that I can't take as helping me?</v>

1771
00:44:39.191 --> 00:44:42.040
<v Speaker 1>Do I feel better or is it fucking with my whole life?</v>

1772
00:44:42.310 --> 00:44:42.701
<v Speaker 1>And for you,</v>

1773
00:44:42.701 --> 00:44:43.990
<v Speaker 1>I think it fucks with your whole life,</v>

1774

1780
00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:52.151
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1781
00:44:52.151 --> 00:44:53.530
<v Speaker 1>you do whatever the fuck you want to do.</v>

1782
00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:54.393
<v Speaker 1>You know how I am.</v>

1783

<v Speaker 1>I give people advice if they want it.</v>

1784
00:44:57.250 --> 00:44:57.790
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

1785
00:44:57.790 --> 00:44:58.760
<v Speaker 1>you and I have had this,</v>

1786
00:44:58.761 --> 00:44:59.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

00:44:59.230 --> 00:45:00.610
<v Speaker 1>this conversation many,</v>

1788
00:45:00.611 --> 00:45:03.550
<v Speaker 1>many times and it never really told you what you should do or shouldn't do.</v>

1789
00:45:03.551 --> 00:45:05.320
<v Speaker 1>I sort of just let you talk and you know,</v>

1790
00:45:05.350 --> 00:45:06.790
<v Speaker 1>and asked you questions and,</v>

1791
00:45:07.270 --> 00:45:07.950
<v Speaker 1>but if,</v>

1792
00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:09.250
<v Speaker 1>if you wanted my advice,</v>

1793
00:45:09.251 --> 00:45:09.971
<v Speaker 1>my advice would say,</v>

1794
00:45:09.971 --> 00:45:10.930
<v Speaker 1>you gotta stop drinking.</v>

1795
00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:12.190
<v Speaker 1>It's not good for you.</v>

1796
00:45:12.810 --> 00:45:13.750
<v Speaker 1>How they look great.</v>

1797
00:45:14.690 --> 00:45:16.900
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>

1798
00:45:16.901 --> 00:45:17.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1799
00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:21.310
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those things like some people can have a drink every now and again</v>

1800
00:45:21.610 --> 00:45:24.340
<v Speaker 1>and some people can't do that and all of a sudden it creeps up and becomes your</v>

1801
00:45:24.341 --> 00:45:25.174
<v Speaker 1>whole day.</v>

1802
00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:25.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1803
00:45:25.750 --> 00:45:26.583

1804
00:45:26.590 --> 00:45:27.320
<v Speaker 1>but it does.</v>

1805
00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:28.570
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely creep back up.</v>

1806
00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:29.111
<v Speaker 1>But for you,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1811
00:45:33.580 --> 00:45:33.970
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>

1812
00:45:33.970 --> 00:45:35.020

1818
00:45:40.290 --> 00:45:44.170

1865
00:46:34.711 --> 00:46:34.950
<v Speaker 1>damn,</v>

1866

<v Speaker 1>it's bad on the bottom.</v>

1867
00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:36.860
<v Speaker 1>Nobody ever says something like,</v>

1868
00:46:36.950 --> 00:46:37.440
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you look good.</v>

1870
00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:39.920
<v Speaker 1>What are you drinking again?</v>

1871
00:46:41.060 --> 00:46:41.960
<v Speaker 1>Really got it together.</v>

1872
00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:42.531
<v Speaker 1>But it's not,</v>

1873
00:46:42.531 --> 00:46:42.951
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1874
00:46:42.951 --> 00:46:46.490
<v Speaker 1>they say like a glass of wine every night and it's not even bad for it.</v>

1875
00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:47.331
<v Speaker 1>And matter of fact,</v>

1876
00:46:47.331 --> 00:46:48.260
<v Speaker 1>it might be beneficial,</v>

1877
00:46:48.350 --> 00:46:49.640
<v Speaker 1>an ounce of alcohol,</v>

1878
00:46:49.730 --> 00:46:54.350
<v Speaker 1>whether it's in a beer wine or it's supposed to be good for your circulation.</v>

1879
00:46:55.100 --> 00:46:55.251
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1880
00:46:55.251 --> 00:46:55.581
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1881
00:46:55.581 --> 00:46:58.760
<v Speaker 1>people used to drink wine with food because they thought it prevented food</v>

1882
00:46:58.761 --> 00:46:59.594
<v Speaker 1>poisoning,</v>

1883
00:46:59.660 --> 00:47:02.390
<v Speaker 1>prevented travelers poison travelers sickness.</v>

1884
00:47:02.391 --> 00:47:05.180
<v Speaker 1>They would call it because back then when they were traveling around those</v>

1885
00:47:05.181 --> 00:47:09.970
<v Speaker 1>assholes with drinking wine out of like animal skins and showing like that they</v>

1886
00:47:09.971 --> 00:47:12.560
<v Speaker 1>made like these flasks out of animal skins.</v>

1887
00:47:12.561 --> 00:47:13.610
<v Speaker 1>That's how they drank their wines.</v>

1888
00:47:13.940 --> 00:47:15.740
<v Speaker 1>I rationalized too because I go,</v>

1889
00:47:15.741 --> 00:47:19.190
<v Speaker 1>I only had two drinks but they're two martinis are like eight shots each of them</v>

1890
00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:23.380
<v Speaker 1>and there are two jumbo drinks to imagine how hard it must have been carried</v>

1891
00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:24.233
<v Speaker 1>food back then.</v>

1892
00:47:24.410 --> 00:47:26.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean they probably all got food sickness,</v>

1893
00:47:26.630 --> 00:47:26.871
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1894
00:47:26.871 --> 00:47:27.740
<v Speaker 1>because Oh my God,</v>

1895
00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:29.430
<v Speaker 1>how long was meat stay good.</v>

1896
00:47:29.431 --> 00:47:30.780
<v Speaker 1>A couple of hours after he killed it.</v>

1897
00:47:30.781 --> 00:47:31.021
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1898
00:47:31.021 --> 00:47:32.190
<v Speaker 1>how many of you have a day?</v>

1899

<v Speaker 1>What do you have?</v>

1900

<v Speaker 1>Do you have two days?</v>

1902
00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:36.220

00:48:15.421 --> 00:48:15.960
<v Speaker 1>airplane.</v>

1936

<v Speaker 8>Wow.</v>

1938

<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1959

<v Speaker 1>He's the guy from operation paperclip.</v>

1962
00:48:48.510 --> 00:48:48.841

<v Speaker 1>or Jewish.</v>

1966

1972
00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:07.410
<v Speaker 1>States after World War II.</v>

<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1979
00:49:11.211 --> 00:49:12.720
<v Speaker 1>they started with Wernher von Braun.</v>

1980
00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:16.740
<v Speaker 1>They got Wernher von Braun and all these different Nazi dudes under operation</v>

1981
00:49:16.741 --> 00:49:17.221
<v Speaker 1>paperclip,</v>

1982
00:49:17.221 --> 00:49:18.780
<v Speaker 1>but they were all like legit Nazis.</v>

1983
00:49:19.110 --> 00:49:22.410
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the dark secrets of the American space program.</v>

1984
00:49:22.830 --> 00:49:23.150
<v Speaker 1>There was,</v>

1985
00:49:23.150 --> 00:49:24.110
<v Speaker 1>it was run by Nazis.</v>

1986
00:49:24.180 --> 00:49:26.340
<v Speaker 1>Wernher von Braun was a legit Nazi,</v>

1987
00:49:26.610 --> 00:49:28.350
<v Speaker 1>like if he was alive today,</v>

1988
00:49:28.351 --> 00:49:31.650
<v Speaker 1>the Simon Wiesenthal Center said they would prosecute him for crimes against</v>

1989
00:49:31.651 --> 00:49:32.310
<v Speaker 1>humanity.</v>

1990
00:49:32.310 --> 00:49:32.820
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1991
00:49:32.820 --> 00:49:36.840
<v Speaker 1>Apparently he had a rocket factory in Berlin and there was this guy who did this</v>

1992
00:49:36.841 --> 00:49:38.530
<v Speaker 1>documentary on m and a,</v>

1993
00:49:38.590 --> 00:49:39.361
<v Speaker 1>the Moon landings,</v>

1994
00:49:39.361 --> 00:49:40.710
<v Speaker 1>and he interviewed,</v>

1995
00:49:40.750 --> 00:49:41.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1996
00:49:41.250 --> 00:49:43.080
<v Speaker 1>people that worked in the rocket factory.</v>

1997
00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:47.190
<v Speaker 1>This guy had tattoos from being the concentration camp and he talked about how</v>

1998
00:49:47.191 --> 00:49:48.050
<v Speaker 1>wonderful I'm Brown.</v>

1999
00:49:48.270 --> 00:49:53.160
<v Speaker 1>Like they would hang the five slowest Jews in front of the rocket factory every</v>

2000
00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:53.450
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

2001
00:49:53.450 --> 00:49:55.110
<v Speaker 1>I think it was like really dark,</v>

2002
00:49:55.170 --> 00:49:56.600
<v Speaker 1>dark education lunch.</v>

2003
00:49:57.190 --> 00:49:57.670
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

2004
00:49:57.670 --> 00:49:57.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2005
00:49:57.930 --> 00:50:00.810
<v Speaker 1>that's beyond hate in humanity.</v>

2006
00:50:00.811 --> 00:50:02.100
<v Speaker 1>It's like that regime,</v>

2007
00:50:02.101 --> 00:50:03.820
<v Speaker 1>that Nazi regime there,</v>

2008
00:50:03.830 --> 00:50:08.670
<v Speaker 1>that ruthlessness also yielded some incredible science.</v>

2009
00:50:09.060 --> 00:50:10.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean the scientific achievements,</v>

2010
00:50:10.951 --> 00:50:14.070
<v Speaker 1>it just in the rocketry and engine engine building and you know,</v>

2011
00:50:14.071 --> 00:50:14.261
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2012
00:50:14.261 --> 00:50:14.401
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2013
00:50:14.401 --> 00:50:15.990
<v Speaker 1>the shit that they were able to do.</v>

2014
00:50:16.410 --> 00:50:19.500
<v Speaker 1>And then Russia scoop some of them up and we scooped some of them up.</v>

2015
00:50:19.501 --> 00:50:22.500
<v Speaker 1>And that's where the autonomy it was invented here.</v>

2016
00:50:22.950 --> 00:50:23.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2017
00:50:23.430 --> 00:50:24.450
<v Speaker 1>Manhattan project.</v>

2018
00:50:24.451 --> 00:50:24.601
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2019
00:50:24.601 --> 00:50:25.560
<v Speaker 1>That was Oppenheimer.</v>

2020
00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:27.480
<v Speaker 1>It was that he a,</v>

2021
00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:28.201
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2022
00:50:28.201 --> 00:50:29.190
<v Speaker 1>it sounds pretty Jewish.</v>

2023
00:50:29.380 --> 00:50:30.420
<v Speaker 1>Is Oppenheimer Jewish.</v>

2024
00:50:30.670 --> 00:50:31.470
<v Speaker 1>It must be right,</v>

2025
00:50:31.470 --> 00:50:32.303

<v Speaker 1>dammit.</v>

2059
00:51:12.180 --> 00:51:13.620
<v Speaker 1>We showed this on a podcast before.</v>

2060
00:51:13.621 --> 00:51:15.450
<v Speaker 1>That is not to experiment with the dog head.</v>

2061
00:51:15.510 --> 00:51:16.111
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2062
00:51:16.111 --> 00:51:18.630
<v Speaker 1>They had electrical impulses into the dog.</v>

2063
00:51:18.631 --> 00:51:21.030
<v Speaker 1>Hadn't made it move after is detached from the body.</v>

2064
00:51:21.210 --> 00:51:22.021
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

2065
00:51:22.021 --> 00:51:23.850

00:51:23.851 --> 00:51:24.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2067

<v Speaker 1>That dog is alive.</v>

2068
00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:26.670
<v Speaker 1>Do they did some crazy shit.</v>

2069
00:51:27.210 --> 00:51:31.530
<v Speaker 1>The Nazis did some crazy shit and they were really obsessed with the cult.</v>

2070
00:51:32.100 --> 00:51:32.401
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

2071
00:51:32.401 --> 00:51:33.270
<v Speaker 1>that's really weird.</v>

2072
00:51:33.271 --> 00:51:34.590
<v Speaker 1>I wonder how much of it is uh,</v>

2073
00:51:34.620 --> 00:51:35.101
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2074
00:51:35.101 --> 00:51:35.600
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2075
00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:40.380
<v Speaker 1>sort of revisionist bullshit that like these reality TV shows try to,</v>

2076
00:51:40.381 --> 00:51:40.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2077
00:51:40.710 --> 00:51:43.750
<v Speaker 1>to do these sort of half documentary type shows.</v>

2078
00:51:44.050 --> 00:51:45.240
<v Speaker 1>Like I love,</v>

2079
00:51:45.300 --> 00:51:46.020
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2080
00:51:46.020 --> 00:51:47.610
<v Speaker 1>ancient aliens a fun show,</v>

2081
00:51:47.611 --> 00:51:49.590
<v Speaker 1>but the reality is they get a lot of shit wrong.</v>

2082
00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:52.590
<v Speaker 1>Like they're not trying to be like super duper accurate about some of their</v>

2083
00:51:52.591 --> 00:51:53.424
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

2084
00:51:53.430 --> 00:51:55.740
<v Speaker 1>And so like when they say something like that,</v>

2085
00:51:55.870 --> 00:51:56.040
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2086
00:51:56.040 --> 00:51:56.680
<v Speaker 1>that the,</v>

2087
00:51:56.680 --> 00:51:59.010
<v Speaker 1>the Nazis were really into the call.</v>

2088
00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:01.800
<v Speaker 1>I really wish I knew how much into the cult they were.</v>

2089
00:52:02.010 --> 00:52:04.380
<v Speaker 1>That was a theme of like Indiana Jones and the template.</v>

2090
00:52:05.390 --> 00:52:05.680
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2091
00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:08.550
<v Speaker 1>remember the old Raiders of the lost Ark when they found the Ark of the covenant</v>

2092
00:52:08.551 --> 00:52:11.070
<v Speaker 1>that was supposed to be the Nazis were after all this a culture.</v>

2093
00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:11.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2094
00:52:11.430 --> 00:52:12.960
<v Speaker 1>Apparently they had like a reputation.</v>

2095
00:52:12.961 --> 00:52:13.411
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>

2096
00:52:13.411 --> 00:52:14.760
<v Speaker 1>we should educate myself on that.</v>

2097
00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:15.833
<v Speaker 1>Find out how,</v>

2098
00:52:15.970 --> 00:52:18.270
<v Speaker 1>how deep that was and what the fuck that was all about.</v>

2099
00:52:20.190 --> 00:52:20.911
<v Speaker 1>But this guy,</v>

2100
00:52:20.911 --> 00:52:21.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2101
00:52:21.510 --> 00:52:22.343
<v Speaker 1>Oppenheimer,</v>

2102
00:52:22.470 --> 00:52:23.303
<v Speaker 1>one of the creepiest,</v>

2103
00:52:23.310 --> 00:52:24.143
<v Speaker 1>you look at it that now.</v>

00:52:24.210 --> 00:52:24.511
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2105
00:52:24.511 --> 00:52:25.201
<v Speaker 1>When he,</v>

2106
00:52:25.201 --> 00:52:25.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2107
00:52:25.530 --> 00:52:26.100
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

2108
00:52:26.100 --> 00:52:27.570
<v Speaker 1>when he blew up the,</v>

2109
00:52:27.750 --> 00:52:28.800
<v Speaker 1>the nuclear bomb,</v>

2110
00:52:29.550 --> 00:52:29.941
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

2111
00:52:29.941 --> 00:52:30.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2112
00:52:30.420 --> 00:52:34.830
<v Speaker 1>he quoted the Bhagavad Gita is this ancient Hindu religious text.</v>

2113
00:52:35.070 --> 00:52:35.401
<v Speaker 1>It said,</v>

2114
00:52:35.401 --> 00:52:36.810
<v Speaker 1>now I am become death.</v>

2115
00:52:36.811 --> 00:52:38.490
<v Speaker 1>The destroyer of worlds.</v>

2116
00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:39.210
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2117
00:52:39.210 --> 00:52:41.220
<v Speaker 1>Could you imagine standing next to a dude?</v>

2118
00:52:41.330 --> 00:52:41.540
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2119
00:52:41.540 --> 00:52:45.300
<v Speaker 1>So fucking smart that he created an atomic bomb,</v>

2120
00:52:45.301 --> 00:52:49.440
<v Speaker 1>like his inventions let gave birth of the atomic bomb and then you're standing</v>

2121
00:52:49.441 --> 00:52:51.810
<v Speaker 1>next to him why it blows up and he quotes that kind of shit.</v>

2122
00:52:52.350 --> 00:52:53.400
<v Speaker 1>Like he's happy about it.</v>

2123
00:52:53.550 --> 00:52:54.383
<v Speaker 1>He's not happy.</v>

2124
00:52:54.780 --> 00:52:55.680
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't happy at all.</v>

2125
00:52:55.681 --> 00:52:56.710
<v Speaker 1>He thought it was a terrible term.</v>

2126
00:52:56.730 --> 00:52:57.390
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

2127
00:52:57.390 --> 00:52:58.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2128
00:52:58.020 --> 00:53:02.010
<v Speaker 1>Well a lot of these guys that are scientists that the real issue is,</v>

2129
00:53:02.210 --> 00:53:03.990
<v Speaker 1>and becoming a scientist,</v>

2130
00:53:04.290 --> 00:53:04.680
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

2131
00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:04.981
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

2132
00:53:04.981 --> 00:53:07.710
<v Speaker 1>you're pursuing knowledge.</v>

2133
00:53:07.740 --> 00:53:08.790
<v Speaker 1>You're pursuing the,</v>

2134
00:53:08.791 --> 00:53:09.031
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2135
00:53:09.031 --> 00:53:11.040
<v Speaker 1>the measurement of a,</v>

2136
00:53:11.041 --> 00:53:11.500
<v Speaker 1>of a,</v>

2137
00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:12.690
<v Speaker 1>of different experiments.</v>

2138
00:53:12.690 --> 00:53:12.911
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2139
00:53:12.911 --> 00:53:13.210
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2140
00:53:13.210 --> 00:53:13.410
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2141
00:53:13.410 --> 00:53:14.041
<v Speaker 1>and you're,</v>

2142
00:53:14.041 --> 00:53:17.640
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to invent and create with technology,</v>

2143
00:53:17.910 --> 00:53:19.110
<v Speaker 1>but at a certain point in time,</v>

2144
00:53:19.111 --> 00:53:21.450
<v Speaker 1>you must know that if you continue down this path,</v>

2145
00:53:21.630 --> 00:53:24.840
<v Speaker 1>it's going to lead to insane amounts of people dying.</v>

2146
00:53:25.050 --> 00:53:26.430
<v Speaker 1>And in your mind,</v>

2147
00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:27.750
<v Speaker 1>it's a battle now,</v>

2148
00:53:27.751 --> 00:53:27.980
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>

2149
00:53:27.980 --> 00:53:29.880
<v Speaker 1>cause it's because as a scientist,</v>

2150
00:53:29.910 --> 00:53:30.743
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>

2151
00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:31.590
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>

2152
00:53:31.590 --> 00:53:33.540
<v Speaker 1>a person is trying to achieve a goal,</v>

2153
00:53:33.630 --> 00:53:36.120
<v Speaker 1>you wanted to see if you can be the first person to do this.</v>

2154
00:53:36.121 --> 00:53:39.750
<v Speaker 1>You want to see if you can be the first person to split an atom inside of bomb</v>

2155
00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:40.441
<v Speaker 1>and lead.</v>

2156
00:53:40.441 --> 00:53:42.360
<v Speaker 1>To this incredible explosion of energy.</v>

2157
00:53:42.361 --> 00:53:43.194
<v Speaker 1>You want to be,</v>

2158
00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:44.100
<v Speaker 1>you want to do that,</v>

2159
00:53:44.310 --> 00:53:45.690
<v Speaker 1>but then you have to realize like,</v>

2160
00:53:45.691 --> 00:53:45.901
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

2161
00:53:45.901 --> 00:53:46.830
<v Speaker 1>if I do do that,</v>

2162
00:53:46.831 --> 00:53:48.270
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck am I really doing?</v>

2163
00:53:48.750 --> 00:53:49.171
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm,</v>

2164
00:53:49.171 --> 00:53:49.530
<v Speaker 1>I am,</v>

2165
00:53:49.530 --> 00:53:51.300
<v Speaker 1>I am the only way this can get done.</v>

2166
00:53:51.570 --> 00:53:52.680
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the argument,</v>

2167
00:53:52.681 --> 00:53:52.771
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2168
00:53:52.771 --> 00:53:53.341
<v Speaker 1>if you don't do it,</v>

2169
00:53:53.341 --> 00:53:54.330
<v Speaker 1>the Nazis are going to do it.</v>

2170
00:53:54.331 --> 00:53:55.500
<v Speaker 1>We have to do it argument.</v>

2171
00:53:55.810 --> 00:53:56.880
<v Speaker 1>That's what the argument was.</v>

2172
00:53:57.270 --> 00:54:02.220
<v Speaker 1>And so this guy was caught in there and he got there first and when he said</v>

2173
00:54:02.221 --> 00:54:02.940
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2174
00:54:02.940 --> 00:54:03.151
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2175
00:54:03.151 --> 00:54:08.151
<v Speaker 1>that that became one of the creepiest quotes ever a attributed to anybody that's</v>

2176
00:54:09.211 --> 00:54:11.940
<v Speaker 1>responsible for anything like really monumental.</v>

2177
00:54:12.330 --> 00:54:17.330
<v Speaker 1>I had read that a lot of the scientists we got were Jews who left Nazi Germany</v>

2178
00:54:17.611 --> 00:54:18.444
<v Speaker 1>when they could get out.</v>

2179
00:54:18.510 --> 00:54:19.410
<v Speaker 1>I bet there was that too.</v>

2180
00:54:19.890 --> 00:54:20.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there was that as well.</v>

2181
00:54:20.911 --> 00:54:21.121
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2182
00:54:21.121 --> 00:54:21.954
<v Speaker 1>that's Einstein.</v>

2183
00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:22.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2184
00:54:22.710 --> 00:54:23.100
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2185
00:54:23.100 --> 00:54:23.701
<v Speaker 1>but I think,</v>

2186
00:54:23.701 --> 00:54:24.310
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2187
00:54:24.310 --> 00:54:26.640
<v Speaker 1>the rocketry program in particular,</v>

2188
00:54:26.700 --> 00:54:29.190
<v Speaker 1>the NASA got a lot of,</v>

2189
00:54:29.220 --> 00:54:29.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2190
00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:30.000
<v Speaker 1>they were,</v>

2191
00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:31.750
<v Speaker 1>they were still a lot of no Germans.</v>

2192
00:54:32.700 --> 00:54:33.810
<v Speaker 1>There were never Nazis.</v>

2193
00:54:34.050 --> 00:54:36.020
<v Speaker 1>It was a operation paperclip and meeting.</v>

2194
00:54:36.030 --> 00:54:38.850
<v Speaker 1>And how many of them were Nazis because their families were forced into that</v>

2195
00:54:38.851 --> 00:54:39.720
<v Speaker 1>because there were stuck there.</v>

2196
00:54:39.720 --> 00:54:43.760
<v Speaker 1>How many of were Nazis because they were really fucking psychopath creeps.</v>

2197
00:54:44.310 --> 00:54:47.040
<v Speaker 1>Who knows how many of them are actually responsible for murder?</v>

2198
00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:48.713
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2199
00:54:48.750 --> 00:54:50.400
<v Speaker 1>I would love to know what he was saying though.</v>

2200
00:54:50.401 --> 00:54:53.010
<v Speaker 1>Cause you got to admit the guy was a riveting performer.</v>

2201
00:54:53.430 --> 00:54:54.263
<v Speaker 1>Hitler,</v>

2202
00:54:55.590 --> 00:54:56.850
<v Speaker 1>charismatic speaker.</v>

2203
00:54:56.851 --> 00:54:57.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean I thought,</v>

2204
00:54:57.670 --> 00:54:59.350
<v Speaker 1>do you ever see pictures of cruise chef?</v>

2205
00:54:59.610 --> 00:54:59.850
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2206
00:54:59.850 --> 00:55:01.440
<v Speaker 1>When he took his shoe off and bang,</v>

2207
00:55:01.490 --> 00:55:01.711
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

2208
00:55:01.711 --> 00:55:04.940
<v Speaker 1>well Barry you fuck takes their shoe or for the Yulin?</v>

2209
00:55:05.230 --> 00:55:06.063
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2210
00:55:06.550 --> 00:55:07.383
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2211
00:55:08.310 --> 00:55:09.930
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember that fear that we had?</v>

2212
00:55:10.310 --> 00:55:11.810
<v Speaker 1>You know there was a oh yeah.</v>

2213
00:55:11.910 --> 00:55:12.181
<v Speaker 1>Of,</v>

2214
00:55:12.181 --> 00:55:14.310
<v Speaker 1>of being in a nuclear war with Russia.</v>

2215
00:55:14.430 --> 00:55:15.180
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

2216
00:55:15.180 --> 00:55:15.720
<v Speaker 1>And it was on,</v>

2217
00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:16.530
<v Speaker 1>it was all the time.</v>

2218
00:55:16.530 --> 00:55:18.810
<v Speaker 1>We always felt it like that was a,</v>

2219
00:55:18.840 --> 00:55:21.110
<v Speaker 1>like in the eighties Dan was like,</v>

2220
00:55:21.130 --> 00:55:23.100
<v Speaker 1>especially because there was no internet back then,</v>

2221
00:55:23.250 --> 00:55:24.910
<v Speaker 1>we didn't know what the fuck was really going on.</v>

2222
00:55:24.930 --> 00:55:25.351
<v Speaker 1>Button.</v>

2223
00:55:25.351 --> 00:55:25.801
<v Speaker 1>The red,</v>

2224
00:55:25.801 --> 00:55:28.220
<v Speaker 1>the red phone picking it,</v>

2225
00:55:28.300 --> 00:55:28.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2226
00:55:28.460 --> 00:55:29.820
<v Speaker 1>the president had that power.</v>

2227
00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:32.340
<v Speaker 1>But you would get your news like from,</v>

2228
00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:32.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2229
00:55:32.730 --> 00:55:36.270
<v Speaker 1>either newspapers or the news shows that that's where you got your news.</v>

2230
00:55:36.271 --> 00:55:39.420
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if it ever came close to a nuclear war.</v>

2231
00:55:39.720 --> 00:55:39.871
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2232
00:55:39.871 --> 00:55:40.681
<v Speaker 1>they say that,</v>

2233
00:55:40.681 --> 00:55:41.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2234
00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:42.300
<v Speaker 1>the Bay of pigs,</v>

2235
00:55:42.330 --> 00:55:43.440
<v Speaker 1>they say the bay of Pigs,</v>

2236
00:55:43.470 --> 00:55:44.520
<v Speaker 1>it got pretty close.</v>

2237
00:55:44.580 --> 00:55:45.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2238
00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:46.113
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2239
00:55:46.270 --> 00:55:49.990
<v Speaker 5>Jerry here about their Russian sleep experiment that they did back in the,</v>

2240
00:55:49.991 --> 00:55:50.651
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2241
00:55:50.651 --> 00:55:52.510
<v Speaker 5>I want to say the 1940s,</v>

2242
00:55:52.990 --> 00:55:55.750
<v Speaker 5>they wanted to keep five prisoners awake.</v>

2243
00:55:55.880 --> 00:55:57.400
<v Speaker 1>I meant the Cuban missile crisis,</v>

2244
00:55:57.460 --> 00:55:58.570
<v Speaker 1>not a bay of pigs,</v>

2245
00:55:58.571 --> 00:55:58.901
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

2246
00:55:58.901 --> 00:55:59.560
<v Speaker 1>what did they do?</v>

2247
00:55:59.560 --> 00:56:02.130
<v Speaker 5>They wanted to keep a five people wait,</v>

2248
00:56:02.140 --> 00:56:03.620
<v Speaker 5>they took five prisoners and they said like,</v>

2249
00:56:03.670 --> 00:56:04.170
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

2250
00:56:04.170 --> 00:56:04.490
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2251
00:56:04.490 --> 00:56:07.450
<v Speaker 5>we went to do some experiments on here and then we'll let you go.</v>

2252
00:56:07.540 --> 00:56:08.600
<v Speaker 5>So for a,</v>

2253
00:56:08.730 --> 00:56:11.470
<v Speaker 5>I think the first five days everyone was kind of,</v>

2254
00:56:11.530 --> 00:56:12.363
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2255
00:56:12.730 --> 00:56:13.361
<v Speaker 5>fine,</v>

2256
00:56:13.361 --> 00:56:13.781
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2257
00:56:13.781 --> 00:56:18.070
<v Speaker 5>and then it went from them like screaming like four hours at a time.</v>

2258
00:56:18.071 --> 00:56:19.630
<v Speaker 5>Like get me Outta here.</v>

2259
00:56:19.631 --> 00:56:21.520
<v Speaker 5>And like they had microphones in this,</v>

2260
00:56:21.521 --> 00:56:22.840
<v Speaker 5>like in this pen,</v>

2261
00:56:22.980 --> 00:56:23.580
<v Speaker 5>it was like,</v>

2262
00:56:23.580 --> 00:56:23.861
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2263
00:56:23.861 --> 00:56:27.700
<v Speaker 5>a sealed kind of thing that had no windows and they had microphones.</v>

2264
00:56:27.701 --> 00:56:28.990
<v Speaker 5>So they could record everybody,</v>

2265
00:56:29.020 --> 00:56:30.880
<v Speaker 5>what they we talked about and stuff,</v>

2266
00:56:30.881 --> 00:56:31.960
<v Speaker 5>and they started going crazy.</v>

2267
00:56:31.961 --> 00:56:34.750
<v Speaker 5>They start screaming and everything and they were pumping this room,</v>

2268
00:56:34.751 --> 00:56:35.170
<v Speaker 5>fill,</v>

2269
00:56:35.170 --> 00:56:38.190
<v Speaker 5>there's some gas and test gas that they were trying to exclude.</v>

2270
00:56:38.210 --> 00:56:40.240
<v Speaker 5>It could keep soldiers up for 10 days at a time,</v>

2271
00:56:40.241 --> 00:56:40.810
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

2272
00:56:40.810 --> 00:56:41.260
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2273
00:56:41.260 --> 00:56:43.450
<v Speaker 5>and so then all the people started screaming.</v>

2274
00:56:43.540 --> 00:56:44.470
<v Speaker 5>Then they were quiet.</v>

2275
00:56:44.590 --> 00:56:46.180
<v Speaker 5>Then all the scientists were like,</v>

2276
00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:50.140
<v Speaker 5>I think the microphones aren't working when they're not making any noises at</v>

2277
00:56:50.141 --> 00:56:50.860
<v Speaker 5>all.</v>

2278
00:56:50.860 --> 00:56:52.920
<v Speaker 5>And so they go in there and uh,</v>

2279
00:56:52.990 --> 00:56:53.291
<v Speaker 5>they're all,</v>

2280
00:56:53.291 --> 00:56:54.580
<v Speaker 5>the people are just very calm.</v>

2281
00:56:54.581 --> 00:56:56.920
<v Speaker 5>They didn't want to leave anymore and stuff like that.</v>

2282
00:56:56.921 --> 00:56:57.850
<v Speaker 5>And then when they experiment,</v>

2283
00:56:57.851 --> 00:56:58.684
<v Speaker 5>it's over.</v>

2284
00:56:58.750 --> 00:57:00.100
<v Speaker 5>They wouldn't leave.</v>

2285
00:57:00.101 --> 00:57:01.960
<v Speaker 5>Like they were like fighting.</v>

2286
00:57:02.500 --> 00:57:03.100
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>

2287
00:57:03.100 --> 00:57:04.840
<v Speaker 5>they wanted to stay in this chamber.</v>

2288
00:57:04.841 --> 00:57:05.291
<v Speaker 5>They started,</v>

2289
00:57:05.291 --> 00:57:06.400
<v Speaker 5>people started like,</v>

2290
00:57:06.430 --> 00:57:09.340
<v Speaker 5>I guess people started like killing themselves because they didn't want to go,</v>

2291
00:57:09.341 --> 00:57:11.260
<v Speaker 5>like ripping their throats out and stuff like that.</v>

2292
00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:11.720
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2293
00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:12.070
<v Speaker 5>And there's,</v>

2294
00:57:12.070 --> 00:57:14.560
<v Speaker 5>there's a video on youtube called,</v>

2295
00:57:15.160 --> 00:57:17.950
<v Speaker 5>what is the exact name of the Russian sleep experiment?</v>

2296
00:57:17.951 --> 00:57:18.460
<v Speaker 5>It's on,</v>

2297
00:57:18.460 --> 00:57:19.930
<v Speaker 5>it's on youtube and there's a bigger,</v>

2298
00:57:19.931 --> 00:57:22.690
<v Speaker 5>I think it's what the microphones recorded.</v>

2299
00:57:23.140 --> 00:57:23.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

2300
00:57:23.480 --> 00:57:25.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm remembering this now,</v>

2301
00:57:25.250 --> 00:57:29.390
<v Speaker 1>but I think I might've in my own head incorporated it into that.</v>

2302
00:57:29.540 --> 00:57:31.760
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember that movie in the mouth of madness?</v>

2303
00:57:32.130 --> 00:57:32.963
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2304
00:57:33.830 --> 00:57:36.890
<v Speaker 1>It was a movie about a dude who was an author went fucking crazy.</v>

2305
00:57:36.891 --> 00:57:40.370
<v Speaker 1>And I think I attributed some of the aspects of his,</v>

2306
00:57:40.540 --> 00:57:40.871
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2307
00:57:40.871 --> 00:57:44.920
<v Speaker 1>the book had some weird power over people when they read the book that gets</v>

2308
00:57:44.921 --> 00:57:46.550
<v Speaker 1>sucked into this crazy world.</v>

2309
00:57:46.551 --> 00:57:47.900
<v Speaker 1>Like the world around them would change.</v>

2310
00:57:48.050 --> 00:57:49.190
<v Speaker 1>Really fascinating book.</v>

2311
00:57:49.770 --> 00:57:50.480
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2312
00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:51.620
<v Speaker 1>I forget who wrote it.</v>

2313
00:57:52.370 --> 00:57:53.011
<v Speaker 1>I want to say it,</v>

2314
00:57:53.011 --> 00:57:53.571
<v Speaker 1>Stephen King,</v>

2315
00:57:53.571 --> 00:57:56.810
<v Speaker 1>but it's not the mouth of madness.</v>

2316
00:57:56.830 --> 00:57:57.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2317
00:57:57.230 --> 00:57:57.700
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2318
00:57:57.700 --> 00:58:01.300
<v Speaker 5>there's a website called creepy Pasta Wiki or whatever,</v>

2319
00:58:01.301 --> 00:58:02.920
<v Speaker 5>just typing the Russian sleep experiment.</v>

2320
00:58:02.921 --> 00:58:04.260
<v Speaker 5>There's the whole story and he goes,</v>

2321
00:58:04.300 --> 00:58:06.040
<v Speaker 5>he breaks it down per hour.</v>

2322
00:58:06.310 --> 00:58:07.210
<v Speaker 5>And then like how,</v>

2323
00:58:07.420 --> 00:58:08.260
<v Speaker 5>how people just,</v>

2324
00:58:08.290 --> 00:58:09.850
<v Speaker 5>they started going crazy and,</v>

2325
00:58:10.430 --> 00:58:11.263
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

2326
00:58:11.970 --> 00:58:12.301
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2327
00:58:12.301 --> 00:58:12.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2328
00:58:12.580 --> 00:58:12.790
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2329
00:58:12.790 --> 00:58:14.420
<v Speaker 1>the movie moving the mouth of mantises,</v>

2330
00:58:14.421 --> 00:58:14.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2331
00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:16.110
<v Speaker 1>it's a John Carpenter movie.</v>

2332
00:58:16.260 --> 00:58:17.220
<v Speaker 1>Creepy ass movie.</v>

2333
00:58:17.221 --> 00:58:18.120
<v Speaker 1>It's a really good movie.</v>

2334
00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:18.751
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

2335
00:58:18.751 --> 00:58:18.931
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2336
00:58:18.931 --> 00:58:19.111
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2337
00:58:19.111 --> 00:58:21.000
<v Speaker 1>for some reason I incorporated that.</v>

2338
00:58:21.001 --> 00:58:22.620
<v Speaker 1>I guess that is like a real news story.</v>

2339
00:58:22.621 --> 00:58:24.090
<v Speaker 1>I incorporated that in my memory.</v>

2340
00:58:24.210 --> 00:58:27.060
<v Speaker 1>That's just goes to show you how like memories can be faulty as,</v>

2341
00:58:28.110 --> 00:58:28.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2342
00:58:28.560 --> 00:58:32.490
<v Speaker 1>I incorporated that reality into a fake memory.</v>

2343
00:58:33.410 --> 00:58:36.230
<v Speaker 5>I guess some one of the people were hurt and they tried to give him an</v>

2344
00:58:36.231 --> 00:58:37.550
<v Speaker 5>anesthesia and the guy was like,</v>

2345
00:58:37.551 --> 00:58:38.870
<v Speaker 5>I must remain awake.</v>

2346
00:58:38.871 --> 00:58:38.991
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2347
00:58:38.991 --> 00:58:39.771
<v Speaker 5>I must stay awake.</v>

2348
00:58:39.771 --> 00:58:40.190
<v Speaker 5>Like they,</v>

2349
00:58:40.190 --> 00:58:41.023
<v Speaker 5>whoa.</v>

2350
00:58:41.460 --> 00:58:42.293
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2351
00:58:42.300 --> 00:58:43.133
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2352
00:58:44.810 --> 00:58:45.690
<v Speaker 5>It's interesting though.</v>

2353
00:58:45.720 --> 00:58:46.460
<v Speaker 5>I read it if,</v>

2354
00:58:46.460 --> 00:58:47.780
<v Speaker 5>when you get a chance to read this whole thing,</v>

2355
00:58:47.781 --> 00:58:49.670
<v Speaker 5>are you sure this is not fiction?</v>

2356
00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:51.590
<v Speaker 5>I always thought it was real.</v>

2357
00:58:51.591 --> 00:58:53.990
<v Speaker 5>I've heard that there's people that questioned it,</v>

2358
00:58:54.010 --> 00:58:54.280
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2359
00:58:54.280 --> 00:58:54.730
<v Speaker 5>because of the,</v>

2360
00:58:54.730 --> 00:58:56.360
<v Speaker 5>based on the youtube video,</v>

2361
00:58:56.810 --> 00:58:59.030
<v Speaker 5>because the youtube video is just the microphone.</v>

2362
00:58:59.031 --> 00:59:00.080
<v Speaker 5>So I think a lot of people are like,</v>

2363
00:59:00.090 --> 00:59:00.861
<v Speaker 5>and that's not real.</v>

2364
00:59:00.861 --> 00:59:02.030
<v Speaker 5>It's somebody just bullshitting,</v>

2365
00:59:02.060 --> 00:59:02.271
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

2366
00:59:02.271 --> 00:59:05.810
<v Speaker 5>Cause at one point they do start screaming and running around and stuff,</v>

2367
00:59:05.811 --> 00:59:06.221
<v Speaker 5>but I don't,</v>

2368
00:59:06.221 --> 00:59:06.461
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

2369
00:59:06.461 --> 00:59:06.530
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

2370
00:59:06.530 --> 00:59:06.741
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2371
00:59:06.741 --> 00:59:08.090
<v Speaker 5>I never really researched it.</v>

2372
00:59:08.660 --> 00:59:09.410
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2373
00:59:09.410 --> 00:59:10.131
<v Speaker 5>it's something,</v>

2374
00:59:10.131 --> 00:59:10.964
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2375
00:59:11.060 --> 00:59:12.350
<v Speaker 5>that I heard a long time ago.</v>

2376
00:59:13.790 --> 00:59:14.623
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

2377
00:59:14.870 --> 00:59:16.400
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

2378
00:59:16.760 --> 00:59:19.040
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure Internet will tell me if it's real or not.</v>

2379
00:59:19.190 --> 00:59:21.080
<v Speaker 5>So if it's on the Internet,</v>

2380
00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:21.831
<v Speaker 5>it's gotta be true.</v>

2381
00:59:21.831 --> 00:59:22.550
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2382
00:59:22.550 --> 00:59:23.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2383
00:59:23.030 --> 00:59:25.280
<v Speaker 1>I wanna I wanna I wanna find out if this is true.</v>

2384
00:59:25.300 --> 00:59:26.510
<v Speaker 1>Should I go to Snopes?</v>

2385
00:59:26.870 --> 00:59:29.030
<v Speaker 1>Is the Russian experiment sleep experiment?</v>

2386
00:59:29.031 --> 00:59:29.864
<v Speaker 1>True?</v>

2387
00:59:31.860 --> 00:59:32.693
<v Speaker 8>Huh?</v>

2388
00:59:33.900 --> 00:59:34.201
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2389
00:59:34.201 --> 00:59:36.120
<v Speaker 1>I need to find this out because we can't keep,</v>

2390
00:59:36.510 --> 00:59:37.250
<v Speaker 1>it helps to make sure.</v>

2391
00:59:37.250 --> 00:59:38.071
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting though,</v>

2392
00:59:38.071 --> 00:59:38.300
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2393
00:59:38.300 --> 00:59:38.650
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2394
00:59:38.650 --> 00:59:43.650
<v Speaker 1>This information p people get so aggro with correcting us.</v>

2395
00:59:44.700 --> 00:59:44.911
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

2396
00:59:44.911 --> 00:59:48.210
<v Speaker 1>you're F you're spreading false knowledge.</v>

2397
00:59:48.810 --> 00:59:50.970
<v Speaker 1>I try so hard to get shit right.</v>

00:59:55.930 --> 00:59:57.540
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] says it's a cousin,</v>

2402
00:59:57.541 --> 00:59:59.010
<v Speaker 1>like everywhere online,</v>

<v Speaker 1>He be see has it?</v>

2406
01:00:04.741 --> 01:00:05.551
<v Speaker 1>It's a strain.</v>

2407
01:00:05.551 --> 01:00:08.220
<v Speaker 1>It's a different strain and it's the male of the species.</v>

2408
01:00:08.221 --> 01:00:09.630
<v Speaker 1>And I understand that.</v>

2409
01:00:10.020 --> 01:00:12.930
<v Speaker 1>And this guy was saying that I was spreading dish information.</v>

2410
01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:15.630
<v Speaker 1>It's like people like are like jumping up,</v>

2411
01:00:15.631 --> 01:00:18.000
<v Speaker 1>trying to catch you saying something wrong.</v>

2412
01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:20.430
<v Speaker 1>So when we have something like this,</v>

2413
01:00:21.990 --> 01:00:22.140
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2414
01:00:22.140 --> 01:00:22.591
<v Speaker 1>this is a way,</v>

2415
01:00:22.591 --> 01:00:23.880
<v Speaker 1>a nice way to say thanks folks.</v>

01:00:24.210 --> 01:00:24.541
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2417
01:00:24.541 --> 01:00:25.321
<v Speaker 1>And if something's wrong,</v>

2418
01:00:25.321 --> 01:00:25.891
<v Speaker 1>say hey,</v>

2419
01:00:25.891 --> 01:00:29.730
<v Speaker 1>I think maybe there's a dispute about the definition of this.</v>

2420
01:00:29.731 --> 01:00:30.564
<v Speaker 1>Or Hey,</v>

2421
01:00:30.570 --> 01:00:31.740
<v Speaker 1>maybe you didn't know.</v>

2422
01:00:31.741 --> 01:00:33.390
<v Speaker 1>But even though everybody calls it a cousin,</v>

2423
01:00:33.391 --> 01:00:34.260
<v Speaker 1>it's something else.</v>

2424
01:00:34.261 --> 01:00:35.040
<v Speaker 1>Or Hey,</v>

2425

2429
01:00:39.180 --> 01:00:42.160
<v Speaker 1>I have to stop with the disinformation.</v>

2430
01:00:42.170 --> 01:00:43.380
<v Speaker 1>Like you're doing it on purpose.</v>

2431
01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:47.220
<v Speaker 1>I have two friends that are lawyers and one of them always ends the argument by</v>

2432
01:00:47.221 --> 01:00:47.491
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>

2433
01:00:47.491 --> 01:00:48.324
<v Speaker 1>you're wrong.</v>

2434
01:00:48.330 --> 01:00:49.230
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>

2435
01:00:49.260 --> 01:00:50.490
<v Speaker 1>So that shuts it all down.</v>

2436
01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:51.353
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>

2437
01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:52.730
<v Speaker 1>Those that,</v>

2438
01:00:52.730 --> 01:00:54.930
<v Speaker 1>those guys are just so gross.</v>

2439
01:00:56.070 --> 01:00:56.431
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>

2440
01:00:56.431 --> 01:00:57.360
<v Speaker 1>you have a conversation,</v>

2441
01:00:57.361 --> 01:00:58.194
<v Speaker 1>you weak bitch,</v>

2442
01:00:58.370 --> 01:01:01.740
<v Speaker 1>have a conversation with someone who has a completely different point of view</v>

2443
01:01:01.741 --> 01:01:03.090
<v Speaker 1>from you and take it in.</v>

2444
01:01:03.750 --> 01:01:07.140
<v Speaker 1>That's why I don't talk politics because I've never seen anybody go at the end</v>

2445
01:01:07.141 --> 01:01:08.160
<v Speaker 1>of the political discussion.</v>

2446
01:01:08.161 --> 01:01:08.994
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

2447
01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:09.833
<v Speaker 1>You got a good point.</v>

2448
01:01:10.020 --> 01:01:11.460
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm going to change my mind you,</v>

2449
01:01:11.461 --> 01:01:15.180
<v Speaker 1>there's an issue with a lot of men socially when it comes to arguing about</v>

2450
01:01:15.181 --> 01:01:17.250
<v Speaker 1>things and that issue is they're trying to win.</v>

2451
01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:17.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2452
01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:17.970
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2453
01:01:17.970 --> 01:01:18.660
<v Speaker 1>they're not just,</v>

2454
01:01:18.660 --> 01:01:21.480
<v Speaker 1>they're not comfortable with themselves enough to just be themselves.</v>

2455
01:01:21.481 --> 01:01:21.780
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2456
01:01:21.780 --> 01:01:25.680
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to establish societal dominance is trying to establish a social</v>

2457
01:01:25.681 --> 01:01:26.514
<v Speaker 1>dominance.</v>

<v Speaker 1>change my life,</v>

2507
01:02:17.450 --> 01:02:18.550
<v Speaker 1>make them really uncomfortable.</v>

2508
01:02:19.060 --> 01:02:20.100
<v Speaker 1>We hang out together more.</v>

2509
01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:21.360
<v Speaker 4>Cause I think I can learn from you.</v>

2510
01:02:21.660 --> 01:02:22.920
<v Speaker 4>There's just something about you.</v>

2511
01:02:23.110 --> 01:02:23.943
<v Speaker 4>And what'd he do?</v>

2512
01:02:24.310 --> 01:02:24.900
<v Speaker 4>Progressive,</v>

2513
01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:25.733
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2514
01:02:26.260 --> 01:02:27.420
<v Speaker 4>mock them or do you,</v>

2515
01:02:27.421 --> 01:02:28.620
<v Speaker 4>do you call them out on it?</v>

2516
01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:30.020
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't call them out.</v>

2517
01:02:30.180 --> 01:02:33.060
<v Speaker 4>I think it's like the guy who was the Israel thing.</v>

2518
01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:37.380
<v Speaker 4>When I found out that he had posted this thing four times,</v>

2519
01:02:37.381 --> 01:02:38.430
<v Speaker 4>I called him up and I says,</v>

2520
01:02:38.431 --> 01:02:39.030
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2521
01:02:39.030 --> 01:02:40.680
<v Speaker 4>really look forward to working with you again.</v>

2522
01:02:40.710 --> 01:02:41.910
<v Speaker 4>I understand you're coming in today.</v>

2523
01:02:41.911 --> 01:02:42.744
<v Speaker 4>If you need a,</v>

2524
01:02:42.890 --> 01:02:44.860
<v Speaker 4>I could send the car for her at the airport.</v>

2525
01:02:44.861 --> 01:02:48.120
<v Speaker 4>Or if I kept myself totally just being fucking evil,</v>

2526
01:02:48.630 --> 01:02:49.111
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>

2527
01:02:49.111 --> 01:02:49.944
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2528
01:02:50.630 --> 01:02:51.301
<v Speaker 4>but instead of like,</v>

2529
01:02:51.301 --> 01:02:52.111
<v Speaker 4>don't fuck you.</v>

2530
01:02:52.111 --> 01:02:53.370
<v Speaker 4>And then he's got that recorded.</v>

2531
01:02:53.371 --> 01:02:53.701
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2532
01:02:53.701 --> 01:02:54.534
<v Speaker 4>hey man,</v>

2533
01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:55.800
<v Speaker 4>thank you for doing that.</v>

2534
01:02:55.801 --> 01:02:56.431
<v Speaker 4>I appreciate it.</v>

2535
01:02:56.431 --> 01:02:57.750
<v Speaker 4>The exposure in Israel,</v>

2536
01:02:57.810 --> 01:02:58.170
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2537
01:02:58.170 --> 01:02:58.501
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

2538
01:02:58.501 --> 01:02:59.670
<v Speaker 4>it's indefensible.</v>

2539
01:02:59.700 --> 01:03:03.690
<v Speaker 4>The fact this guy wanted you to fly into a war zone is fucking nuts to tell some</v>

2540
01:03:03.691 --> 01:03:04.590
<v Speaker 4>jokey jokes,</v>

2541
01:03:04.890 --> 01:03:05.220
<v Speaker 4>guys,</v>

2542
01:03:05.220 --> 01:03:05.900
<v Speaker 4>an asshole.</v>

2543
01:03:05.900 --> 01:03:06.270
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2544
01:03:06.270 --> 01:03:08.940
<v Speaker 4>he didn't like the fact that it would give us deposit back or whatever the fuck</v>

2545
01:03:08.941 --> 01:03:09.660
<v Speaker 4>went wrong.</v>

2546
01:03:09.660 --> 01:03:10.231
<v Speaker 4>But guess what,</v>

2547
01:03:10.231 --> 01:03:10.680
<v Speaker 4>Dude?</v>

2548
01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:15.150
<v Speaker 4>That's part of what goes on when you're dealing with shit in a war zone and it's</v>

2549
01:03:15.151 --> 01:03:17.180
<v Speaker 4>not the fucking entertainers fault.</v>

2550
01:03:17.230 --> 01:03:19.260
<v Speaker 4>They don't want to fly into a fucking war zone.</v>

2551
01:03:19.290 --> 01:03:19.711
<v Speaker 4>And the guy,</v>

2552
01:03:19.711 --> 01:03:22.080
<v Speaker 4>the writer apologized and he said,</v>

2553
01:03:22.081 --> 01:03:24.990
<v Speaker 4>we gotta be careful not to get comedians that they're skittish.</v>

2554
01:03:25.290 --> 01:03:26.220
<v Speaker 4>So in other words,</v>

2555
01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:27.091
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2556
01:03:27.091 --> 01:03:28.800
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry for what I said,</v>

2557
01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:30.690
<v Speaker 4>but these guys are pussies.</v>

2558
01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:32.610
<v Speaker 4>Skiddish skiddish yeah.</v>

2559
01:03:32.611 --> 01:03:33.060
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2560
01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:36.040
<v Speaker 4>I don't think you used the word skittish when there's bombs,</v>

2561
01:03:37.090 --> 01:03:38.490
<v Speaker 4>he's skittish around bomb.</v>

2562
01:03:38.790 --> 01:03:41.310
<v Speaker 4>If there's actual bombs going off,</v>

2563
01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:43.950
<v Speaker 4>attacks from getting shot at,</v>

2564
01:03:44.010 --> 01:03:45.150
<v Speaker 4>is it a real war?</v>

2565
01:03:45.270 --> 01:03:45.481
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2571
01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:52.350
<v Speaker 4>Skiddish you'd judgemental cunt face.</v>

2605
01:04:38.070 --> 01:04:39.810
<v Speaker 4>Apparently it was just a piece of fiction.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Your pulse elevated.</v>

2617
01:04:50.460 --> 01:04:50.900
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2618
01:04:50.900 --> 01:04:51.051
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

2619
01:04:51.051 --> 01:04:55.410
<v Speaker 4>we learned about this shit from powerful Dave Asprey and powerful Tim Ferris.</v>

2620
01:04:55.980 --> 01:04:56.251
<v Speaker 4>It's an,</v>

2621
01:04:56.251 --> 01:04:57.084
<v Speaker 4>I just feel awake.</v>

2622
01:04:57.120 --> 01:04:58.080
<v Speaker 4>I will say no more.</v>

2623
01:04:59.580 --> 01:04:59.990
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2625
01:05:00.781 --> 01:05:01.614
<v Speaker 4>if it works.</v>

2626
01:05:01.620 --> 01:05:02.453
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2627
01:05:02.550 --> 01:05:02.901
<v Speaker 4>that's the,</v>

2628
01:05:02.901 --> 01:05:06.810
<v Speaker 4>one of the cool things about having this podcast is that I get to hang out and</v>

2629
01:05:06.811 --> 01:05:10.440
<v Speaker 4>talk to all these like dudes way off the beaten path.</v>

2630
01:05:10.490 --> 01:05:12.120
<v Speaker 4>It would never get to communicate with like,</v>

2633
01:05:14.670 --> 01:05:17.100

2634
01:05:18.070 --> 01:05:18.811
<v Speaker 1>And he runs a,</v>

<v Speaker 1>a tech company.</v>

2637
01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:21.940

2649
01:05:46.710 --> 01:05:47.110
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2650
01:05:47.110 --> 01:05:48.550
<v Speaker 1>podcasts while like after it's over,</v>

2651
01:05:48.551 --> 01:05:52.210
<v Speaker 1>like you've got to go back with a piece of paper and write down shit and Google</v>

2652
01:05:52.211 --> 01:05:52.721
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

2653

<v Speaker 1>And yeah,</v>

2654
01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:54.550
<v Speaker 1>it was a crazy podcast.</v>

2655
01:05:54.551 --> 01:05:56.140
<v Speaker 1>I learned a lot of stuff and like how,</v>

2656
01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:58.780
<v Speaker 1>what are the odds of getting a chance to talk to a guy like that?</v>

2657
01:05:58.781 --> 01:06:00.190
<v Speaker 1>If you didn't have a podcast like this,</v>

2658
01:06:00.430 --> 01:06:03.010
<v Speaker 1>how would you get someone to sit down with you for three hours and talk about</v>

2659
01:06:03.011 --> 01:06:03.420
<v Speaker 1>shit?</v>

2660
01:06:03.420 --> 01:06:03.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

2663
01:06:05.281 --> 01:06:06.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm always amazed by the mind.</v>

2664
01:06:06.990 --> 01:06:08.230
<v Speaker 1>And I used to teach school.</v>

2665
01:06:08.231 --> 01:06:11.350
<v Speaker 1>I taught fourth grade and I was amazed at how kids had different intelligence</v>

2666
01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:12.753
<v Speaker 1>and how,</v>

2667
01:06:12.910 --> 01:06:13.091
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2668
01:06:13.091 --> 01:06:14.950
<v Speaker 1>I remember I was really bad in math,</v>

2669
01:06:14.980 --> 01:06:16.270
<v Speaker 1>but I knew every,</v>

2670
01:06:16.990 --> 01:06:18.490
<v Speaker 1>the batting average of every,</v>

2671
01:06:18.610 --> 01:06:21.850
<v Speaker 1>the top 10 players in American national league without even thinking about it.</v>

2672
01:06:22.330 --> 01:06:23.320
<v Speaker 1>I knew that er,</v>

2673
01:06:23.350 --> 01:06:26.620
<v Speaker 1>they earned run average of the pictures and that incredible the way your mind</v>

2674
01:06:26.621 --> 01:06:27.431
<v Speaker 1>accepts things.</v>

2675
01:06:27.431 --> 01:06:29.950
<v Speaker 1>And then I was like fucking retarded in math.</v>

2676
01:06:30.190 --> 01:06:30.461
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2677
01:06:30.461 --> 01:06:31.360
<v Speaker 1>I always loved that I could,</v>

2678
01:06:31.361 --> 01:06:33.390
<v Speaker 1>I knew like Marvin Hagler record.</v>

2679
01:06:33.570 --> 01:06:33.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2680
01:06:33.970 --> 01:06:34.301
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2681
01:06:34.301 --> 01:06:34.930

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2683
01:06:35.500 --> 01:06:36.700
<v Speaker 1>who we lost to,</v>

2684
01:06:36.701 --> 01:06:37.750
<v Speaker 1>what the decision was.</v>

2685
01:06:38.070 --> 01:06:38.291
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2686
01:06:38.291 --> 01:06:40.210
<v Speaker 1>I knew a Durand's record,</v>

2687
01:06:40.211 --> 01:06:40.391
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2688
01:06:40.391 --> 01:06:43.030
<v Speaker 1>I could read you back like how,</v>

2689
01:06:43.031 --> 01:06:43.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2690
01:06:43.510 --> 01:06:43.781
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>

2691
01:06:43.781 --> 01:06:48.730
<v Speaker 1>where he had his first loss when he beat can be Canon to get the title to watch</v>

2692
01:06:48.731 --> 01:06:49.660
<v Speaker 1>that whole fight the other night.</v>

2693
01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:50.321
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2694
01:06:50.321 --> 01:06:50.741
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>

2695
01:06:50.741 --> 01:06:51.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2696
01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:51.720
<v Speaker 1>I pack.</v>

2697
01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:52.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2698
01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:52.990
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2699
01:06:52.990 --> 01:06:53.201
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2700
01:06:53.201 --> 01:06:53.741
<v Speaker 1>That was a,</v>

2701
01:06:53.741 --> 01:06:54.574
<v Speaker 1>that was crazy.</v>

2702
01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:56.170
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy the way he walked into it.</v>

2703
01:06:56.180 --> 01:06:57.013
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

2704
01:06:57.160 --> 01:06:59.940
<v Speaker 1>You can't let that and you can't make that instantaneous mistake.</v>

2705
01:06:59.941 --> 01:07:00.790
<v Speaker 1>And boxing you'd done?</v>

2706
01:07:01.180 --> 01:07:04.750
<v Speaker 1>I think he's got his attention very stretched as well.</v>

2707
01:07:04.780 --> 01:07:07.150
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of issues if pack.</v>

2708
01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:07.341
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2709
01:07:07.341 --> 01:07:07.780
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

2710
01:07:07.780 --> 01:07:10.030
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the big issues is that he's like,</v>

2711
01:07:10.570 --> 01:07:14.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we can even wrap our heads around how famous that guy is.</v>

2712
01:07:14.110 --> 01:07:14.300
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2713
01:07:14.300 --> 01:07:15.133
<v Speaker 1>in the Philippines,</v>

2714
01:07:15.940 --> 01:07:17.110
<v Speaker 1>he's like a God,</v>

2715
01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:18.460
<v Speaker 1>he's gonna be president.</v>

2716
01:07:18.461 --> 01:07:19.810
<v Speaker 1>He could be president of the Philippines.</v>

2717
01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:23.350
<v Speaker 1>So there's that and he being a congressman over there,</v>

2718
01:07:23.380 --> 01:07:26.950
<v Speaker 1>well who knows what kind of crazy fucking pressure that guys under,</v>

2719
01:07:27.220 --> 01:07:27.910
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>

2720
01:07:27.910 --> 01:07:28.571
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand.</v>

2721
01:07:28.571 --> 01:07:29.321
<v Speaker 1>Then on top of that,</v>

2722
01:07:29.321 --> 01:07:33.520
<v Speaker 1>he's trying to chain train and then on top of that he's super famous,</v>

2723
01:07:33.521 --> 01:07:34.620
<v Speaker 1>so he's got to constantly do,</v>

2724
01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:35.920
<v Speaker 1>be doing media things,</v>

2725
01:07:36.070 --> 01:07:37.190
<v Speaker 1>constantly be doing interviews,</v>

2726
01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:40.060
<v Speaker 1>was constantly talking to people and then on top of that he has a family.</v>

2727
01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:42.340
<v Speaker 1>Like that's a lot of shit.</v>

2728
01:07:42.700 --> 01:07:43.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

2729
01:07:43.150 --> 01:07:44.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2730
01:07:44.470 --> 01:07:45.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2731
01:07:45.070 --> 01:07:46.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you could really do that.</v>

2732
01:07:46.630 --> 01:07:49.990
<v Speaker 1>I think you could do it for a little while because you were so good at boxing to</v>

2733
01:07:49.991 --> 01:07:50.824
<v Speaker 1>begin with.</v>

2734
01:07:51.190 --> 01:07:55.960
<v Speaker 1>But I think he's at a point where his skills have started to slip because of the</v>

2735
01:07:55.961 --> 01:07:59.380
<v Speaker 1>fact that he's not putting the same amount of focus into it as it was because to</v>

2736
01:07:59.381 --> 01:08:02.380
<v Speaker 1>me the strategy and then on top of that he's had a lot of wars and he's had a</v>

2737
01:08:02.381 --> 01:08:03.340
<v Speaker 1>lot of crazy fights.</v>

2738
01:08:03.370 --> 01:08:03.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2739
01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:06.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean he wasn't getting hit too much in other fights but man these,</v>

2740
01:08:06.250 --> 01:08:07.600
<v Speaker 1>these God mark has fights.</v>

2741
01:08:07.601 --> 01:08:08.890
<v Speaker 1>Mark has just has his number.</v>

2742
01:08:09.550 --> 01:08:10.500
<v Speaker 1>Some guys just have a,</v>

2743
01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:12.070
<v Speaker 1>I think he was winning up to that point.</v>

2744
01:08:12.340 --> 01:08:12.790
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

2745
01:08:12.790 --> 01:08:13.390
<v Speaker 1>yes I did.</v>

<v Speaker 6>you see someone on television,</v>

2978
01:14:06.381 --> 01:14:10.570
<v Speaker 6>you can get completely convinced that they're involved in some sort of civic</v>

2979
01:14:10.580 --> 01:14:11.850
<v Speaker 6>society to hold you down.</v>

2989
01:14:27.660 --> 01:14:31.340
<v Speaker 1>there's much less conspiracy afoot than people would like to see fit there.</v>

2990
01:14:31.350 --> 01:14:32.480
<v Speaker 1>Then people would like to,</v>

2991
01:14:32.490 --> 01:14:33.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2992
01:14:33.090 --> 01:14:33.923
<v Speaker 1>like to believe.</v>

2993
01:14:33.930 --> 01:14:36.030
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever been contacted by any of these groups?</v>

2994
01:14:36.031 --> 01:14:36.301
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2995
01:14:36.301 --> 01:14:38.270
<v Speaker 3>like Scientologists are Illuminati</v>

2996
01:14:39.330 --> 01:14:39.691
<v Speaker 1>ontology.</v>

2997
01:14:39.691 --> 01:14:40.081
<v Speaker 1>They seem to,</v>

2998
01:14:40.081 --> 01:14:42.300
<v Speaker 1>they have a lot of money and then they protect their people.</v>

2999
01:14:42.301 --> 01:14:43.134
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3000
01:14:43.260 --> 01:14:44.760
<v Speaker 1>we have to rework some of your rules,</v>

3001
01:14:44.970 --> 01:14:45.900
<v Speaker 1>but I think we'll be fine.</v>

3002
01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:47.101
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3003
01:14:47.101 --> 01:14:47.690
<v Speaker 3>But I guess if you,</v>

3004
01:14:47.690 --> 01:14:49.010
<v Speaker 3>not saying that religion did,</v>

3005
01:14:49.011 --> 01:14:49.770
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

3006
01:14:49.770 --> 01:14:54.740
<v Speaker 3>did they believe in God or they believe they're a group about assets.</v>

3007
01:14:55.170 --> 01:14:56.450
<v Speaker 1>They're very successful.</v>

3008
01:14:56.600 --> 01:14:57.950
<v Speaker 1>If you look at what Scientology has done,</v>

3009
01:14:57.960 --> 01:14:58.150
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

3010
01:14:58.150 --> 01:15:01.670
<v Speaker 1>they're amazing at making money and it managing their business,</v>

3011
01:15:01.671 --> 01:15:05.630
<v Speaker 1>their business of Scientology and amazing at acquiring really expensive real</v>

3012
01:15:05.631 --> 01:15:06.290
<v Speaker 1>estate.</v>

3013
01:15:06.290 --> 01:15:08.990
<v Speaker 1>I think they're like a big real estate holder in Los Angeles.</v>

3014
01:15:08.991 --> 01:15:11.060
<v Speaker 1>They own like some really big fucking buildings,</v>

3015
01:15:11.061 --> 01:15:12.500
<v Speaker 1>a lot of like really expensive stuff.</v>

3016
01:15:12.860 --> 01:15:13.693
<v Speaker 1>So they're smart.</v>

3017
01:15:13.770 --> 01:15:14.810
<v Speaker 1>That was all on Hubbard,</v>

3018
01:15:14.811 --> 01:15:15.110
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3019
01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:15.411
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3020
01:15:15.411 --> 01:15:17.900
<v Speaker 1>Well he's the guy who started it has been dead for a long time.</v>

3021
01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:19.220
<v Speaker 1>Do they think that,</v>

3022
01:15:19.250 --> 01:15:19.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3023
01:15:19.580 --> 01:15:21.560
<v Speaker 1>did they believe in a god or they believe their God,</v>

3024
01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:23.460
<v Speaker 1>they believe aliens.</v>

3025
01:15:23.570 --> 01:15:26.330
<v Speaker 1>They believe some crazy shit written by l Ron Hubbard.</v>

3026
01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:27.620
<v Speaker 1>That's what's really weird about it.</v>

3027
01:15:27.621 --> 01:15:29.120
<v Speaker 1>It's like they believe some,</v>

3028
01:15:30.170 --> 01:15:35.170
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me that some people just need a structure that needs some stuff that</v>

3029
01:15:36.501 --> 01:15:38.660
<v Speaker 1>tells them all the answers.</v>

3030
01:15:38.690 --> 01:15:40.880
<v Speaker 1>Every question that they have is answered,</v>

3031
01:15:40.881 --> 01:15:42.440
<v Speaker 1>whether it logical or not.</v>

3032
01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:47.800
<v Speaker 1>Some people just need that base covered and they'll take that base from time</v>

3033
01:15:48.141 --> 01:15:49.370
<v Speaker 1>tology of tea.</v>

3034
01:15:49.520 --> 01:15:53.450
<v Speaker 1>They'll take that base from Buddhism or they'll take that base from</v>

3035
01:15:53.480 --> 01:15:54.313
<v Speaker 1>Christianity,</v>

3036
01:15:54.380 --> 01:15:56.210
<v Speaker 1>they'll take that base from whoever gets there first.</v>

3037
01:15:56.330 --> 01:15:57.350
<v Speaker 1>Whoever gets there first,</v>

3038
01:15:57.410 --> 01:16:00.140
<v Speaker 1>whoever's in the right position who resonates with them the most,</v>

3039
01:16:00.350 --> 01:16:01.183
<v Speaker 1>they'll accept that.</v>

3040
01:16:01.700 --> 01:16:03.620
<v Speaker 1>And for something like Scientology,</v>

3041
01:16:03.621 --> 01:16:06.380
<v Speaker 1>one of the good things about Scientology as opposed to a lot of the other</v>

3042
01:16:06.381 --> 01:16:11.381
<v Speaker 1>religions is there's a lot of like pretty interesting principles that they,</v>

3043
01:16:12.170 --> 01:16:16.860
<v Speaker 1>that they masked with in terms of managing your consciousness in terms of</v>

3044
01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:20.060
<v Speaker 1>positive thinking and accepting um,</v>

3045
01:16:20.090 --> 01:16:20.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3046
01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:22.850
<v Speaker 1>positive things in your life and acting change.</v>

3047
01:16:22.851 --> 01:16:24.620
<v Speaker 1>Like then there's like a lot of like,</v>

3048
01:16:24.621 --> 01:16:25.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3049
01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:27.350
<v Speaker 1>like that's why dianetics were so successful.</v>

3050
01:16:27.351 --> 01:16:29.360
<v Speaker 1>Like dianetics when they sold it on TV,</v>

3051
01:16:29.540 --> 01:16:32.960
<v Speaker 1>you didn't know that you were becoming a part of some sort of crazy religious</v>

3052
01:16:32.961 --> 01:16:33.510
<v Speaker 1>cult.</v>

3053
01:16:33.510 --> 01:16:35.600
<v Speaker 1>The thought that you were buying a self help book.</v>

3054
01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:36.321
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

3055
01:16:36.321 --> 01:16:37.940
<v Speaker 1>I bought a bunch of self help books,</v>

3056
01:16:37.941 --> 01:16:38.180
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3057
01:16:38.180 --> 01:16:39.710
<v Speaker 1>I bought Tony Robbins Shit.</v>

3058
01:16:39.711 --> 01:16:41.120
<v Speaker 1>I listened to his books on tape.</v>

3059
01:16:41.270 --> 01:16:41.511
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3060
01:16:41.511 --> 01:16:42.090
<v Speaker 1>When I was a,</v>

3061
01:16:42.090 --> 01:16:43.250
<v Speaker 1>when I was poor as fuck,</v>

3062
01:16:43.251 --> 01:16:44.150
<v Speaker 1>living in revere.</v>

3063
01:16:44.450 --> 01:16:44.990
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3064
01:16:44.990 --> 01:16:46.200
<v Speaker 1>I used to live in cities.</v>

3065
01:16:46.350 --> 01:16:46.821
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3066
01:16:46.821 --> 01:16:47.654
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>

3067
01:16:47.830 --> 01:16:49.540
<v Speaker 1>I was well struggling comedian,</v>

3068
01:16:49.590 --> 01:16:53.180
<v Speaker 1>I was listening to Anthony Robbins tapes and just thinking about like how to</v>

3069
01:16:53.210 --> 01:16:54.150
<v Speaker 1>make things happen.</v>

3070
01:16:54.180 --> 01:16:56.360
<v Speaker 1>Like he's like really good motivator,</v>

3071
01:16:56.570 --> 01:16:56.931
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3072
01:16:56.931 --> 01:16:58.270
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

3073
01:16:58.271 --> 01:16:59.750
<v Speaker 1>the dianetics thing,</v>

3074
01:16:59.751 --> 01:17:01.370
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was this very similar,</v>

3075
01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:02.390
<v Speaker 1>that's what I thought it was.</v>

3076
01:17:02.690 --> 01:17:03.710
<v Speaker 1>And then when I got it,</v>

3077
01:17:03.711 --> 01:17:04.131
<v Speaker 1>when I,</v>

3078
01:17:04.131 --> 01:17:04.964
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3079
01:17:05.210 --> 01:17:10.210
<v Speaker 1>when I got the book they sent me invitations to go to like the Scientology</v>

3080
01:17:11.391 --> 01:17:12.590
<v Speaker 1>center and all this different Shit.</v>

3081
01:17:12.591 --> 01:17:14.840
<v Speaker 1>They sent me them almost every month.</v>

3082
01:17:15.020 --> 01:17:17.630
<v Speaker 1>They were relentless for years.</v>

3083
01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:19.280
<v Speaker 1>Like if you are lost,</v>

3084
01:17:19.310 --> 01:17:21.830
<v Speaker 1>they reach out and they just get you,</v>

3085
01:17:21.831 --> 01:17:23.510
<v Speaker 1>it's like this is pre internet.</v>

3086
01:17:23.510 --> 01:17:23.721
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3087
01:17:23.721 --> 01:17:25.100
<v Speaker 1>Cause this is like 1994.</v>

3088
01:17:25.310 --> 01:17:29.390
<v Speaker 1>So it was fascinating to me because I didn't understand what it was.</v>

3089
01:17:29.450 --> 01:17:30.050
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>

3090
01:17:30.050 --> 01:17:30.950
<v Speaker 1>we had no internet.</v>

3091
01:17:30.951 --> 01:17:31.201
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3092
01:17:31.201 --> 01:17:32.150
<v Speaker 1>We'll wrap your head around that.</v>

3093
01:17:32.151 --> 01:17:32.720
<v Speaker 1>People.</v>

3094
01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:33.553
<v Speaker 1>So when I,</v>

3095
01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:36.350
<v Speaker 1>if someone asked me what Scientology was,</v>

3096
01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:38.330
<v Speaker 1>I had to like literally go to a store.</v>

3097
01:17:38.331 --> 01:17:39.240
<v Speaker 1>I had a bio book,</v>

3098
01:17:39.241 --> 01:17:40.310
<v Speaker 1>I had read it myself.</v>

3099
01:17:40.580 --> 01:17:44.900
<v Speaker 1>So in reading this dianetics book and then getting all these emails from these</v>

3100
01:17:44.901 --> 01:17:45.351
<v Speaker 1>males,</v>

3101
01:17:45.351 --> 01:17:48.440
<v Speaker 1>actual physical mail sent to my mailbox from this group,</v>

3102
01:17:48.441 --> 01:17:48.741
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3103
01:17:48.741 --> 01:17:49.850
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is this?</v>

3104
01:17:49.900 --> 01:17:53.690
<v Speaker 1>So then it piqued my curiosity and then I really looked into when I was like,</v>

3105
01:17:53.691 --> 01:17:54.170
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

3106
01:17:54.170 --> 01:17:54.720
<v Speaker 1>this is a,</v>

3107
01:17:54.720 --> 01:17:55.580
<v Speaker 1>this is amazing.</v>

3108
01:17:55.581 --> 01:17:58.220
<v Speaker 1>This is a cult and this is ever going to get any of that.</v>

3109
01:17:58.370 --> 01:17:58.640
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3110
01:17:58.640 --> 01:17:58.791
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3111
01:17:58.791 --> 01:18:00.020
<v Speaker 1>I never went to like a meeting or anything,</v>

3112
01:18:00.021 --> 01:18:03.890
<v Speaker 1>but I did sit down with a dude and he did that a stress test thing on me.</v>

3113
01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:04.670
<v Speaker 1>What they did.</v>

3114
01:18:04.670 --> 01:18:04.891
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3115
01:18:04.891 --> 01:18:05.081
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3116
01:18:05.081 --> 01:18:05.540
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3117
01:18:05.540 --> 01:18:06.560
<v Speaker 1>But that was way later.</v>

3118
01:18:06.561 --> 01:18:07.940
<v Speaker 1>That was like a couple of years ago.</v>

3119
01:18:07.970 --> 01:18:08.121
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3120
01:18:08.121 --> 01:18:09.110
<v Speaker 1>you definitely needed,</v>

3121
01:18:09.111 --> 01:18:09.320
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

3122
01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:11.690
<v Speaker 1>Didn't like the outcome of that test was like,</v>

3123
01:18:11.691 --> 01:18:12.890
<v Speaker 1>you need to become a scientologist.</v>

3124
01:18:12.891 --> 01:18:13.310
<v Speaker 1>It was pretty,</v>

3125
01:18:13.310 --> 01:18:14.143
<v Speaker 1>pretty clear.</v>

3126
01:18:15.180 --> 01:18:15.770
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3127
01:18:15.770 --> 01:18:16.160
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

3128
01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:18.050
<v Speaker 1>it's the most ridiculous device ever.</v>

3129
01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:18.740
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3130
01:18:18.740 --> 01:18:20.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm sitting there and I don't think,</v>

3131
01:18:20.181 --> 01:18:20.961
<v Speaker 1>I wish that we had,</v>

3132
01:18:20.961 --> 01:18:21.610
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3133
01:18:21.610 --> 01:18:21.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3134
01:18:21.950 --> 01:18:25.100
<v Speaker 1>Kara Santa Maria on who she could explain us the science behind it and how</v>

3135
01:18:25.101 --> 01:18:27.590
<v Speaker 1>woefully lacking it is and real science.</v>

3136
01:18:27.830 --> 01:18:28.970
<v Speaker 1>But it gives,</v>

3137
01:18:28.971 --> 01:18:29.804
<v Speaker 1>you really does.</v>

3138
01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:30.810
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>

3139
01:18:30.810 --> 01:18:31.170
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3140
01:18:31.170 --> 01:18:31.580
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

3141
01:18:31.580 --> 01:18:35.690
<v Speaker 1>they would sit down with you and you hold on to this e meter and even ask you</v>

3142
01:18:35.691 --> 01:18:36.524
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>

3143
01:18:36.710 --> 01:18:38.750
<v Speaker 1>And I don't remember the nature of the questions,</v>

3144
01:18:38.870 --> 01:18:40.880
<v Speaker 1>but I just remember it being so ridiculous.</v>

3145
01:18:41.180 --> 01:18:42.470
<v Speaker 1>And I remember asking like,</v>

3146
01:18:42.471 --> 01:18:44.240
<v Speaker 1>how many different things can affect this?</v>

3147
01:18:44.270 --> 01:18:44.600
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3148
01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:46.800
<v Speaker 1>what about intent does intent if effect it,</v>

3149
01:18:46.801 --> 01:18:47.601
<v Speaker 1>what if I get angry?</v>

3150
01:18:47.601 --> 01:18:48.434
<v Speaker 1>Does that affect it?</v>

3151
01:18:48.470 --> 01:18:52.880
<v Speaker 1>So then I tried to just like think of answers like in a fucked up way.</v>

3152
01:18:52.900 --> 01:18:55.790
<v Speaker 1>So like really raised my craziness up.</v>

3153
01:18:56.150 --> 01:18:57.020
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>

3154
01:18:57.070 --> 01:18:57.903
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3155
01:18:57.910 --> 01:19:02.180
<v Speaker 1>I I I I'm not exactly sure cause it was really high when I did this.</v>

3156
01:19:02.690 --> 01:19:03.170
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3157
01:19:03.170 --> 01:19:04.340
<v Speaker 1>but so it wasn't that long ago.</v>

3158
01:19:04.341 --> 01:19:04.810
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't,</v>

3159
01:19:04.810 --> 01:19:05.660
<v Speaker 1>it was a couple years ago.</v>

3160
01:19:05.900 --> 01:19:06.321
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

3161
01:19:06.321 --> 01:19:07.154
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3162
01:19:07.250 --> 01:19:08.540

3163
01:19:08.690 --> 01:19:09.320
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3164
01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:10.220
<v Speaker 1>game show in my head.</v>

3165
01:19:10.410 --> 01:19:11.243
<v Speaker 9>Okay.</v>

3166
01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:12.840
<v Speaker 1>We were down there cause so that was,</v>

3167
01:19:12.841 --> 01:19:13.674
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3168
01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:15.750
<v Speaker 1>that was pre before fear factor came out.</v>

3169
01:19:15.751 --> 01:19:16.800
<v Speaker 1>So it was a couple of years ago,</v>

3170
01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:18.300
<v Speaker 1>at least three years ago.</v>

3171
01:19:18.390 --> 01:19:18.930
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

3172

3208
01:20:01.611 --> 01:20:05.330
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're asking me these weird questions when I'm holding onto the floor,</v>

3209

01:20:09.731 --> 01:20:14.731
<v Speaker 1>your life and what they would recommend is that you look into dianetics and then</v>

3213
01:20:15.521 --> 01:20:17.470
<v Speaker 1>you look into dianetics and then boom,</v>

<v Speaker 1>For what it's Christianity or anything.</v>

3223
01:20:34.690 --> 01:20:36.040
<v Speaker 1>When you give someone a framework,</v>

3224
01:20:36.041 --> 01:20:37.000
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it just looked,</v>

3242
01:21:00.011 --> 01:21:01.150

3249
01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:09.710
<v Speaker 1>What the reason.</v>

3250
01:21:09.860 --> 01:21:10.693
<v Speaker 1>Lack of integrity.</v>

3251
01:21:11.070 --> 01:21:11.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3252

01:21:17.750 --> 01:21:18.980
<v Speaker 1>let's listen to this.</v>

3258
01:21:19.170 --> 01:21:20.003
<v Speaker 1>Let's see if we can,</v>

3259
01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:25.190
<v Speaker 10>there was a reason for people getting sab</v>

3260
01:21:28.020 --> 01:21:30.060
<v Speaker 10>75 billion years ago.</v>

3261
01:21:30.900 --> 01:21:31.410
<v Speaker 10>Back then,</v>

3262
01:21:31.410 --> 01:21:32.800
<v Speaker 10>that was a galactic federation,</v>

3263
01:21:33.750 --> 01:21:37.640
<v Speaker 10>which was ruled over by the Lord Walk,</v>

3264
01:21:37.660 --> 01:21:37.951
<v Speaker 10>walk,</v>

3265
01:21:37.951 --> 01:21:38.260
<v Speaker 10>walk,</v>

3266
01:21:38.260 --> 01:21:39.093
<v Speaker 10>walk.</v>

3267
01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:43.500
<v Speaker 10>Galaxy was overpopulated and so he rounded up the hop as aliens from all</v>

3268
01:21:43.501 --> 01:21:45.390
<v Speaker 10>different plans and the hospitals.</v>

3269
01:21:51.470 --> 01:21:52.301
<v Speaker 1>The graphic it says,</v>

3270
01:21:52.301 --> 01:21:54.090
<v Speaker 1>this is what Scientology was actually right,</v>

3271
01:21:54.140 --> 01:21:59.020
<v Speaker 10>believe which looked like DC Hayes except the croc cruisers.</v>

3272
01:21:59.030 --> 01:22:04.030
<v Speaker 10>They took the frozen alien bodies to harm and dump them into the volcanoes of</v>

3273
01:22:04.161 --> 01:22:04.994
<v Speaker 10>Hawaii.</v>

3274
01:22:06.180 --> 01:22:07.820
<v Speaker 10>The aliens were no longer have chosen</v>

3275
01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:10.700
<v Speaker 10>the souls of those aliens.</v>

3276
01:22:10.701 --> 01:22:13.970
<v Speaker 10>However they've gone and all bloated up towards the sky.</v>

3277
01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:19.960
<v Speaker 10>But the evil Lord Zino had repaired for this Paul Paul Walker shows to return.</v>

3278
01:22:21.080 --> 01:22:23.450
<v Speaker 10>And so we built giant full catchers in the sky,</v>

3279
01:22:26.860 --> 01:22:31.860
<v Speaker 10>the rain watching to see what he wishes he knew about all the phones were forced</v>

3280
01:22:32.061 --> 01:22:33.860
<v Speaker 10>to watch days of brainwashing material.</v>

3281
01:22:34.100 --> 01:22:36.680
<v Speaker 10>What's trick them into believing a false reality.</v>

01:23:32.600 --> 01:23:33.433
<v Speaker 3>Or Know</v>

3318
01:23:34.510 --> 01:23:34.900
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

3319
01:23:34.900 --> 01:23:35.900
<v Speaker 2>Wear her outfit with the,</v>

3320
01:23:35.901 --> 01:23:39.720
<v Speaker 2>but I remember one night we were working at the Mirage and I would,</v>

3321
01:23:40.480 --> 01:23:40.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3322
01:23:40.790 --> 01:23:42.290
<v Speaker 2>and when we work in like casinos,</v>

3323
01:23:42.291 --> 01:23:46.190
<v Speaker 2>we would see each other like I don't have an arena or there'd be a break after</v>

3324
01:23:46.191 --> 01:23:46.460
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

3325
01:23:46.460 --> 01:23:46.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3326
01:23:46.850 --> 01:23:49.730
<v Speaker 2>so I would never see her cause she'd be putting on one over wigs and her</v>

3327
01:23:49.740 --> 01:23:50.360
<v Speaker 2>eyelashes,</v>

3328
01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:51.193
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>

3329
01:23:51.260 --> 01:23:52.190
<v Speaker 2>And she goes to me,</v>

3330
01:23:52.191 --> 01:23:53.024
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3331
01:23:53.900 --> 01:23:54.501
<v Speaker 2>as we're walking,</v>

3332
01:23:54.501 --> 01:23:55.460
<v Speaker 2>we're walking by and she goes,</v>

3333
01:23:55.461 --> 01:23:58.220
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe you did a just over a hedge joke,</v>

3334
01:23:58.250 --> 01:23:59.330
<v Speaker 2>my grandmothers here.</v>

3335
01:24:00.630 --> 01:24:00.981
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

3336
01:24:00.981 --> 01:24:03.710
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe that your grandfather gets to see your ass.</v>

3337
01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:08.270
<v Speaker 3>Later on that night were downstairs</v>

3338
01:24:08.450 --> 01:24:11.990
<v Speaker 2>party in her room and her grandmother says like,</v>

3339
01:24:11.991 --> 01:24:13.210
<v Speaker 2>almost like it was a sitcom.</v>

3340
01:24:13.220 --> 01:24:13.581
<v Speaker 2>She goes,</v>

3341
01:24:13.581 --> 01:24:15.590
<v Speaker 2>I love that bit you did about the hedge.</v>

3342
01:24:15.980 --> 01:24:16.813
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

3343
01:24:17.830 --> 01:24:18.663
<v Speaker 3>She goes,</v>

3344
01:24:18.740 --> 01:24:19.670
<v Speaker 3>you know what the fuck?</v>

3345
01:24:20.580 --> 01:24:21.413
<v Speaker 3>She was cool.</v>

3346
01:24:21.590 --> 01:24:22.131
<v Speaker 2>Very cool.</v>

3347
01:24:22.131 --> 01:24:22.371
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3348
01:24:22.371 --> 01:24:23.900
<v Speaker 2>it's so weird how people are,</v>

3349
01:24:23.901 --> 01:24:25.550
<v Speaker 2>like friend of mine is working with her,</v>

3350
01:24:25.551 --> 01:24:28.730
<v Speaker 2>they're doing a gig in Russia soon and she,</v>

3351
01:24:28.750 --> 01:24:29.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3352
01:24:29.020 --> 01:24:31.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean she's very fucking talented,</v>

3353
01:24:31.311 --> 01:24:31.521
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3354
01:24:31.521 --> 01:24:35.360
<v Speaker 2>obviously she accomplished whether you like her or not and she's insecure about</v>

3355
01:24:35.361 --> 01:24:36.194
<v Speaker 2>her voice,</v>

3356
01:24:36.430 --> 01:24:37.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3357
01:24:37.040 --> 01:24:37.301
<v Speaker 2>and I'm,</v>

3358
01:24:37.301 --> 01:24:37.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

3359
01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:38.151
<v Speaker 2>I'm fuck,</v>

3360
01:24:38.151 --> 01:24:39.020
<v Speaker 2>I suck,</v>

3361
01:24:39.050 --> 01:24:40.130
<v Speaker 2>but I love to sing.</v>

3362
01:24:40.430 --> 01:24:42.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm singing with him or all my fucking arm.</v>

3363
01:24:42.061 --> 01:24:42.860
<v Speaker 2>Then it's secure.</v>

3364
01:24:42.860 --> 01:24:43.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

3365
01:24:43.090 --> 01:24:44.210
<v Speaker 2>but of course she's famous,</v>

3366
01:24:44.211 --> 01:24:44.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3367
01:24:44.460 --> 01:24:45.111
<v Speaker 2>as a singer.</v>

3368
01:24:45.111 --> 01:24:48.890
<v Speaker 2>But it's just so weird how people can be insecure and we know this from any part</v>

3369
01:24:48.891 --> 01:24:49.724
<v Speaker 2>of show business,</v>

3370
01:24:50.140 --> 01:24:50.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3371
01:24:50.420 --> 01:24:52.220
<v Speaker 2>the needy comedian would you think?</v>

3372
01:24:52.310 --> 01:24:53.143
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3373
01:24:53.300 --> 01:24:57.230
<v Speaker 6>It's the worst and unfortunately this is a lot of us that I really liked it or</v>

3374
01:24:57.231 --> 01:24:59.390
<v Speaker 6>like that they want to come up and see is this good?</v>

3375
01:24:59.391 --> 01:25:00.091
<v Speaker 6>Is this okay?</v>

3376
01:25:00.091 --> 01:25:00.301
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3377
01:25:00.301 --> 01:25:00.500
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3378
01:25:00.500 --> 01:25:00.681

3381
01:25:03.980 --> 01:25:04.880
<v Speaker 6>Go up there dude.</v>

3382
01:25:05.090 --> 01:25:07.070
<v Speaker 6>It's funny because the way we do stand up,</v>

3383
01:25:07.100 --> 01:25:08.210
<v Speaker 6>all of us together,</v>

3384
01:25:08.211 --> 01:25:10.580
<v Speaker 6>it's kind of the same way when we all get together.</v>

3385
01:25:10.760 --> 01:25:11.541
<v Speaker 6>We have these shows,</v>

3386
01:25:11.541 --> 01:25:14.720
<v Speaker 6>whether it's a are your Dunkin or or Joey or whatever.</v>

3387
01:25:14.870 --> 01:25:17.930
<v Speaker 6>We're just hanging out and then one of us will go on stage,</v>

3388
01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:18.311
<v Speaker 6>meaning we,</v>

3389
01:25:18.311 --> 01:25:19.250
<v Speaker 6>you've done these shows with us.</v>

3390
01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:20.720
<v Speaker 6>Of course another one would go onstage,</v>

3391
01:25:21.020 --> 01:25:24.810
<v Speaker 6>but every now and then we'll bring someone new into the mix and then they're</v>

3392
01:25:24.830 --> 01:25:25.371
<v Speaker 6>like I said,</v>

3393
01:25:25.371 --> 01:25:26.630
<v Speaker 6>he could match it up with this,</v>

3394
01:25:26.631 --> 01:25:27.464
<v Speaker 6>which I did.</v>

3395
01:25:27.470 --> 01:25:28.340
<v Speaker 6>What are you doing?</v>

3396
01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:29.393
<v Speaker 6>Go Up.</v>

3397
01:25:29.960 --> 01:25:30.681
<v Speaker 6>Go up there.</v>

3398
01:25:30.681 --> 01:25:31.341
<v Speaker 6>Come on man.</v>

3399
01:25:31.341 --> 01:25:32.770
<v Speaker 6>Joey was both of them.</v>

3400
01:25:32.810 --> 01:25:34.370
<v Speaker 6>Both of them were on that show list and I did.</v>

3401
01:25:34.371 --> 01:25:35.690
<v Speaker 6>They left I think before you came in.</v>

3402
01:25:36.070 --> 01:25:36.903
<v Speaker 6>I just,</v>

3403
01:25:36.940 --> 01:25:38.300
<v Speaker 6>I met Ari upstairs.</v>

3404
01:25:38.370 --> 01:25:38.920
<v Speaker 6>They were both,</v>

3405
01:25:38.920 --> 01:25:40.340
<v Speaker 6>they're both fucking really funny,</v>

3406
01:25:40.341 --> 01:25:42.560
<v Speaker 6>but Joey was fucking high as it could.</v>

3407
01:25:42.561 --> 01:25:42.810
<v Speaker 6>I can't.</v>

3408
01:25:42.810 --> 01:25:44.470
<v Speaker 6>His eyes were like clothes.</v>

3409
01:25:44.550 --> 01:25:47.870
<v Speaker 6>There's I'm so fucking item and they almost fell.</v>

3410
01:25:48.410 --> 01:25:48.891
<v Speaker 6>I tell you,</v>

3411
01:25:48.891 --> 01:25:50.300
<v Speaker 6>it must fell off to big boy.</v>

3412
01:25:50.330 --> 01:25:50.811
<v Speaker 6>Big Boy.</v>

3413
01:25:50.811 --> 01:25:51.381
<v Speaker 6>That's not good.</v>

3414
01:25:51.381 --> 01:25:52.790
<v Speaker 6>If he falls off that stage,</v>

3415
01:25:52.791 --> 01:25:55.730
<v Speaker 6>that's not a fall backwards near the way.</v>

3416
01:25:55.731 --> 01:25:56.564
<v Speaker 6>He's good,</v>

3417
01:25:56.610 --> 01:25:58.790
<v Speaker 6>but he would have killed the shingles up front.</v>

3418
01:25:59.180 --> 01:25:59.421
<v Speaker 6>He can.</v>

3419
01:25:59.421 --> 01:26:00.350
<v Speaker 6>You can break things.</v>

3420
01:26:00.380 --> 01:26:01.213
<v Speaker 6>I wish I was.</v>

3421
01:26:01.970 --> 01:26:02.870
<v Speaker 6>I was watching those</v>

3422
01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:07.210
<v Speaker 4>when you were doing some of those bits and said they couldn't fucking help but</v>

3423
01:26:07.211 --> 01:26:08.044
<v Speaker 4>laugh,</v>

3424
01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:10.760
<v Speaker 4>you know when you did the the the last bit,</v>

3425
01:26:10.780 --> 01:26:11.613
<v Speaker 4>but you know.</v>

3426
01:26:11.720 --> 01:26:12.081
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3427
01:26:12.081 --> 01:26:12.351
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3428
01:26:12.351 --> 01:26:12.790
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

01:26:12.790 --> 01:26:13.100
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

3430
01:26:13.100 --> 01:26:14.160
<v Speaker 4>I loved watching him.</v>

3431
01:26:14.180 --> 01:26:17.570
<v Speaker 4>I love watching people who can't help laugh even though they think I've seen</v>

3432
01:26:17.571 --> 01:26:19.100
<v Speaker 4>people shake their head and laugh.</v>

3433
01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:19.410
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

3434
01:26:19.410 --> 01:26:19.520
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3435
01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:24.020
<v Speaker 4>you can't disapprove and left 11 when you're out with coworkers and because you</v>

3436
01:26:24.021 --> 01:26:26.780
<v Speaker 4>don't want those other ladies in your office to how you know,</v>

3437
01:26:26.781 --> 01:26:29.630
<v Speaker 4>like you're all on the corporate ladder together.</v>

3438
01:26:29.631 --> 01:26:31.850
<v Speaker 4>You don't want them to have a turn it on.</v>

3439
01:26:31.851 --> 01:26:32.091
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3440
01:26:32.091 --> 01:26:32.361
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3441
01:26:32.361 --> 01:26:35.210
<v Speaker 4>We went there and you see this one every fucking blow job jokes.</v>

3442
01:26:35.211 --> 01:26:36.350
<v Speaker 4>She's laughing her ass off.</v>

3443
01:26:37.250 --> 01:26:40.730
<v Speaker 4>But before you came in I asked him something that you really shouldn't ask</v>

3444
01:26:40.731 --> 01:26:41.130
<v Speaker 4>women.</v>

3445
01:26:41.130 --> 01:26:41.963
<v Speaker 4>We shouldn't ask him.</v>

3446
01:26:42.020 --> 01:26:42.710
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

3447
01:26:42.710 --> 01:26:43.610
<v Speaker 4>which one are you?</v>

3448
01:26:44.030 --> 01:26:48.800
<v Speaker 4>Which one of you ladies do you think is the hottest and also the at least hot.</v>

3449
01:26:49.370 --> 01:26:51.950
<v Speaker 4>And then one of them was their boss and go leave her out of it.</v>

3450
01:26:51.951 --> 01:26:53.210
<v Speaker 4>Then she's the boss.</v>

3451
01:26:53.211 --> 01:26:53.870
<v Speaker 4>But just like,</v>

3452
01:26:53.870 --> 01:26:54.141
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3453
01:26:54.141 --> 01:26:56.570
<v Speaker 4>obviously one of you is in a different league than the others.</v>

3454
01:26:56.600 --> 01:26:56.811
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3455
01:26:56.811 --> 01:26:57.061
<v Speaker 4>I could,</v>

3456
01:26:57.061 --> 01:27:00.500
<v Speaker 4>I could see and they were like fucking laughing and at least one of them is</v>

3457
01:27:00.501 --> 01:27:00.680
<v Speaker 4>thinking,</v>

3458
01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:01.640
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if it's me,</v>

3459
01:27:02.050 --> 01:27:02.660

3471
01:27:14.750 --> 01:27:17.210
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to be a fucking a plugged machine,</v>

3472

<v Speaker 4>but it's going to be called busting balls with dom.</v>

3473
01:27:19.580 --> 01:27:20.620
<v Speaker 4>Rarer and,</v>

3474
01:27:20.810 --> 01:27:24.290
<v Speaker 4>and we encourage interaction with the crowd and how they say,</v>

3475
01:27:24.291 --> 01:27:25.460
<v Speaker 4>no talking during the show.</v>

3476
01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:26.810
<v Speaker 4>I want you to fucking talk.</v>

3477
01:27:27.140 --> 01:27:29.030
<v Speaker 4>I want you to break balls then we have,</v>

3480
01:27:29.980 --> 01:27:30.641
<v Speaker 4>we'll have a,</v>

3481
01:27:30.641 --> 01:27:31.100
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>also an interview and we can bust each other's balls where we can be fucking</v>

3483
01:27:33.981 --> 01:27:34.371
<v Speaker 4>goofy,</v>

3484
01:27:34.371 --> 01:27:34.870
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3485
01:27:34.870 --> 01:27:38.360
<v Speaker 4>so it's essentially not heckling because you're actually encouraging the</v>

3486
01:27:38.361 --> 01:27:39.020
<v Speaker 4>interaction.</v>

3487
01:27:39.020 --> 01:27:39.741
<v Speaker 4>It's not heckling,</v>

3488
01:27:39.741 --> 01:27:39.881
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3489
01:27:39.881 --> 01:27:41.180
<v Speaker 4>it's not like a regular comedy show.</v>

3490
01:27:41.220 --> 01:27:42.053
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3491
01:27:42.190 --> 01:27:42.640
<v Speaker 4>that's second.</v>

3492
01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:44.990
<v Speaker 4>It's going to confuse the shit out of your regular comedy club people.</v>

3493
01:27:45.170 --> 01:27:46.520
<v Speaker 4>But I'll say it at the beginning,</v>

3494
01:27:46.521 --> 01:27:47.030
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3495
01:27:47.030 --> 01:27:47.950
<v Speaker 4>but then they're gonna want,</v>

3496
01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:49.850
<v Speaker 4>they're gonna want that kind of Damo rarer action.</v>

3497
01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:50.560
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna.</v>

3498
01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:51.393
<v Speaker 4>I don't want that,</v>

3499
01:27:51.470 --> 01:27:51.950
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

3500
01:27:51.950 --> 01:27:53.180
<v Speaker 4>that spontaneous shit.</v>

3501
01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:54.073
<v Speaker 4>I don't mind.</v>

3502
01:27:54.450 --> 01:27:55.283
<v Speaker 4>You don't mind.</v>

3503
01:27:55.370 --> 01:27:56.180
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3504
01:27:56.180 --> 01:27:58.460
<v Speaker 4>I don't like when it bits get interrupted.</v>

3505
01:27:58.640 --> 01:27:59.960
<v Speaker 4>I don't mind talking to people.</v>

3506
01:28:00.990 --> 01:28:02.600

<v Speaker 4>you give sometimes.</v>

3509
01:28:04.310 --> 01:28:05.090
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes you do.</v>

3510
01:28:05.090 --> 01:28:07.250
<v Speaker 4>You know this drunk man drops for a while.</v>

3511
01:28:07.251 --> 01:28:08.870
<v Speaker 4>That's part of our business and they,</v>

3512
01:28:08.871 --> 01:28:12.020
<v Speaker 4>and they also want to like have an interaction with you.</v>

3513
01:28:12.210 --> 01:28:13.880
<v Speaker 4>You ever have people call out your bits?</v>

3514
01:28:13.910 --> 01:28:15.640
<v Speaker 4>Like you're not doing enough that,</v>

<v Speaker 4>can't fuck.</v>

3519
01:28:20.430 --> 01:28:22.610
<v Speaker 4>It's really hard to do a bit when someone asks,</v>

3520
01:28:22.670 --> 01:28:24.650
<v Speaker 4>you can do it cause it's so and spontaneous.</v>

3521
01:28:24.651 --> 01:28:27.290
<v Speaker 4>It's also really hard to do a bit when you know that they already know it.</v>

3522
01:28:27.420 --> 01:28:28.190
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 6>and anybody getting hungry.</v>

01:30:29.800 --> 01:30:30.790
<v Speaker 6>And when you score it,</v>

3609
01:30:30.791 --> 01:30:34.720
<v Speaker 6>you squirt like you've never scored it before and then you just make a decision.</v>

<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3643
01:31:24.080 --> 01:31:25.290
<v Speaker 4>A couple of years ago they said,</v>

<v Speaker 4>And they said he might've shoemaker up was for you.</v>

3650
01:31:33.750 --> 01:31:35.730
<v Speaker 4>Now he was getting $7,500 to open.</v>

3651
01:31:35.731 --> 01:31:35.881
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

3652
01:31:35.881 --> 01:31:36.420
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3653
01:31:36.420 --> 01:31:37.290
<v Speaker 4>I was getting good money,</v>

3654
01:31:37.291 --> 01:31:38.040
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3655
01:31:38.040 --> 01:31:38.581
<v Speaker 4>So I said,</v>

<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>

3657

3659
01:31:40.651 --> 01:31:41.350
<v Speaker 4>Let them open.</v>

3660
01:31:41.350 --> 01:31:41.730
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3661
01:31:41.730 --> 01:31:45.780
<v Speaker 4>That's 45 minutes instead of 25 to fuck me.</v>

3662
01:31:45.980 --> 01:31:46.950
<v Speaker 4>And you know what he said at the end,</v>

3663
01:31:47.700 --> 01:31:48.533
<v Speaker 4>he goes,</v>

3664
01:31:48.690 --> 01:31:49.930
<v Speaker 4>I'll never work with you again.</v>

3665
01:31:49.931 --> 01:31:50.430
<v Speaker 4>And I said,</v>

3666
01:31:50.430 --> 01:31:50.911
<v Speaker 4>why is that?</v>

3667
01:31:50.911 --> 01:31:51.391
<v Speaker 4>And I'm thinking,</v>

3668
01:31:51.391 --> 01:31:52.790
<v Speaker 4>you don't got a chance to work with me again.</v>

3669
01:31:52.800 --> 01:31:53.101
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

3670
01:31:53.101 --> 01:31:55.020
<v Speaker 4>because I can't believe you could follow me.</v>

3671
01:31:55.080 --> 01:31:56.070
<v Speaker 4>What a fucking ego.</v>

3672
01:31:56.430 --> 01:31:56.861
<v Speaker 4>What a jerk.</v>

3673
01:31:56.861 --> 01:31:57.694
<v Speaker 4>He was upset.</v>

3674
01:31:57.720 --> 01:31:59.460
<v Speaker 4>He was upset because I him,</v>

3675
01:31:59.461 --> 01:32:00.390
<v Speaker 4>he thought he buried me.</v>

3676
01:32:00.450 --> 01:32:01.560
<v Speaker 4>So was it like a Jew?</v>

3677
01:32:01.650 --> 01:32:04.350
<v Speaker 4>Was he like sort of jokingly,</v>

3678
01:32:04.410 --> 01:32:05.243
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3679
01:32:05.340 --> 01:32:06.810
<v Speaker 4>jokingly praising,</v>

3680
01:32:06.811 --> 01:32:07.591
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3681
01:32:07.591 --> 01:32:08.940
<v Speaker 4>he's just such a deck.</v>

3682
01:32:08.970 --> 01:32:10.200
<v Speaker 4>He wasn't joking at all.</v>

3683
01:32:10.290 --> 01:32:13.260
<v Speaker 4>He just really thought nobody could follow him cause he got a standing ovation.</v>

3684
01:32:13.500 --> 01:32:14.101
<v Speaker 4>So I walked out,</v>

3685
01:32:14.101 --> 01:32:15.450
<v Speaker 4>I got like a fucking guy up for me.</v>

3686
01:32:15.451 --> 01:32:16.740
<v Speaker 4>It got a standing ovation when I'm not going,</v>

3687
01:32:16.741 --> 01:32:18.270
<v Speaker 4>what am I supposed to fly around the room?</v>

3688
01:32:18.770 --> 01:32:19.160
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3689
01:32:19.160 --> 01:32:19.531
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3690
01:32:19.531 --> 01:32:19.950
<v Speaker 4>and then,</v>

3691
01:32:19.950 --> 01:32:21.240
<v Speaker 4>but they were there to see me.</v>

3692
01:32:21.320 --> 01:32:22.110
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

3693
01:32:22.110 --> 01:32:22.740
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3694
01:32:22.740 --> 01:32:22.981
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>

3695
01:32:22.981 --> 01:32:23.814
<v Speaker 4>it was not hard.</v>

3696
01:32:24.180 --> 01:32:26.900
<v Speaker 4>Really hard to bury someone when people are there to see you.</v>

3697
01:32:27.150 --> 01:32:28.120
<v Speaker 4>I know he was just,</v>

3698
01:32:28.210 --> 01:32:29.580
<v Speaker 4>and I didn't even get laid into him.</v>

3699
01:32:29.580 --> 01:32:31.800
<v Speaker 4>Like what an ancillary was telling him about the time.</v>

3700
01:32:32.220 --> 01:32:32.400
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3701
01:32:32.400 --> 01:32:32.900
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3702
01:32:32.900 --> 01:32:35.430
<v Speaker 4>imagine just doing 20 minutes over when you're opening for somebody.</v>

3703
01:32:35.450 --> 01:32:36.930
<v Speaker 4>Just money and fucking run.</v>

01:32:36.990 --> 01:32:37.171
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3705
01:32:37.171 --> 01:32:38.750
<v Speaker 4>Why did he do that to Jack Him?</v>

3706
01:32:39.210 --> 01:32:39.541
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3707
01:32:39.541 --> 01:32:41.460
<v Speaker 4>because I just didn't want to communicate with him.</v>

3708
01:32:41.461 --> 01:32:44.100
<v Speaker 4>I didn't want to fucking have a talk out with them and because I don't want to</v>

3709
01:32:44.101 --> 01:32:44.880
<v Speaker 4>be friends with them.</v>

3710
01:32:44.880 --> 01:32:45.713

4026
01:40:05.321 --> 01:40:08.290
<v Speaker 1>British royals is staggering and that's why we're,</v>

4034
01:40:21.641 --> 01:40:22.211
<v Speaker 1>I can see.</v>

<v Speaker 1>She feels no shame about the death of this woman.</v>

01:40:26.380 --> 01:40:29.290
<v Speaker 1>She's saying nothing about the death of this poor woman.</v>

4038
01:40:30.190 --> 01:40:30.461
<v Speaker 1>Boy.</v>

4039
01:40:30.461 --> 01:40:32.440
<v Speaker 1>Morrissey needs a fucking hug.</v>

4040
01:40:33.340 --> 01:40:34.960
<v Speaker 1>What a depressed guy.</v>

4041
01:40:35.380 --> 01:40:35.921
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

4042
01:40:35.921 --> 01:40:38.680
<v Speaker 1>How does he know what another person feels?</v>

4043
01:40:39.100 --> 01:40:40.030
<v Speaker 1>How can he say like,</v>

4044
01:40:40.031 --> 01:40:41.080
<v Speaker 1>she feels nothing.</v>

4045
01:40:41.280 --> 01:40:41.580
<v Speaker 1>How,</v>

4046
01:40:41.580 --> 01:40:42.460
<v Speaker 1>how can you,</v>

4047
01:40:42.461 --> 01:40:43.510
<v Speaker 1>how can you really say that?</v>

4048
01:40:44.130 --> 01:40:44.560
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4049
01:40:44.560 --> 01:40:45.161
<v Speaker 1>what is,</v>

4050
01:40:45.161 --> 01:40:48.040
<v Speaker 1>what is someone say when someone commits suicide over a prank?</v>

4051
01:40:48.040 --> 01:40:48.530
<v Speaker 1>Like that?</v>

4052
01:40:48.530 --> 01:40:49.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4053
01:40:49.080 --> 01:40:51.040
<v Speaker 1>but you can't say she feels no shame.</v>

4054
01:40:51.400 --> 01:40:52.540
<v Speaker 1>She's saying nothing.</v>

4055
01:40:52.690 --> 01:40:53.050
<v Speaker 1>How did,</v>

4056
01:40:53.050 --> 01:40:53.250
<v Speaker 1>does she,</v>

4057
01:40:53.250 --> 01:40:55.410
<v Speaker 1>is she supposed to say something publicly about that?</v>

4058
01:40:55.411 --> 01:40:55.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4059
01:40:55.860 --> 01:40:56.151
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

4060
01:40:56.151 --> 01:40:58.440
<v Speaker 1>what obligations do you have to,</v>

4061
01:40:58.570 --> 01:40:59.403
<v Speaker 1>she has,</v>

4062
01:40:59.580 --> 01:40:59.911
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4063
01:40:59.911 --> 01:41:00.930
<v Speaker 1>she has nothing to do with it.</v>

4064
01:41:00.931 --> 01:41:04.380
<v Speaker 1>What obligations does she have to comment on something that's obviously a</v>

4065
01:41:04.381 --> 01:41:05.220
<v Speaker 1>horrific thing.</v>

4066
01:41:05.430 --> 01:41:07.260
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

4067
01:41:07.261 --> 01:41:08.130
<v Speaker 1>to blame her,</v>

4068
01:41:08.131 --> 01:41:09.270
<v Speaker 1>that's so ridiculous.</v>

4069
01:41:10.320 --> 01:41:11.340
<v Speaker 1>Silly Morrissey,</v>

4070
01:41:12.360 --> 01:41:14.580
<v Speaker 1>the idea of the royal family is crazy though,</v>

4071
01:41:14.970 --> 01:41:16.470
<v Speaker 1>that the fact that you could give a fuck,</v>

4072
01:41:16.590 --> 01:41:17.820
<v Speaker 1>CNN had it on,</v>

4073
01:41:17.940 --> 01:41:18.720
<v Speaker 1>it was the,</v>

4074
01:41:18.720 --> 01:41:20.190
<v Speaker 1>the problems in Gaza.</v>

4075
01:41:20.250 --> 01:41:20.551
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4076
01:41:20.551 --> 01:41:24.210
<v Speaker 1>And CNN was talking about the dangers of Gaza showed like some night vision with</v>

4077
01:41:24.211 --> 01:41:25.740
<v Speaker 1>a bomb going off and shit like that.</v>

4078
01:41:25.741 --> 01:41:26.574
<v Speaker 1>And then they said,</v>

4079
01:41:26.790 --> 01:41:27.810
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

4080
01:41:27.811 --> 01:41:28.620
<v Speaker 1>Royal Kate,</v>

4081
01:41:28.620 --> 01:41:29.970
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck her name is,</v>

4084
01:41:34.010 --> 01:41:34.843
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

4085
01:41:34.850 --> 01:41:35.683
<v Speaker 1>next to it.</v>

4086
01:41:35.810 --> 01:41:36.290
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4087
01:41:36.290 --> 01:41:36.801
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

4088
01:41:36.801 --> 01:41:37.050
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

4089
01:41:37.050 --> 01:41:38.660
<v Speaker 4>and it stands cause itself.</v>

4090
01:41:40.220 --> 01:41:41.053
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>

4091
01:41:41.270 --> 01:41:41.541
<v Speaker 4>Joe.</v>

4092
01:41:41.541 --> 01:41:42.490
<v Speaker 4>I was in uh,</v>

4093
01:41:42.590 --> 01:41:46.850
<v Speaker 4>Canada and when the Queen Mother died at 102 I had a bit about her,</v>

4094
01:41:46.880 --> 01:41:47.271
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4095
01:41:47.271 --> 01:41:47.601
<v Speaker 4>about it,</v>

4096
01:41:47.601 --> 01:41:48.050
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4097
01:41:48.050 --> 01:41:49.460
<v Speaker 4>like she looked 101,</v>

4098
01:41:49.461 --> 01:41:52.340
<v Speaker 4>this whole thing she got on the treadmill thing.</v>

4099
01:41:52.700 --> 01:41:53.600
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

4100
01:41:54.050 --> 01:41:54.290
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

4101
01:41:54.290 --> 01:41:55.610
<v Speaker 4>when I did it in Montreal,</v>

4102
01:41:55.670 --> 01:41:56.750
<v Speaker 4>it got an applause.</v>

4103
01:41:57.050 --> 01:41:59.150
<v Speaker 4>It's interesting how people react to royalty.</v>

4104
01:41:59.390 --> 01:42:00.470
<v Speaker 4>When I did it in Ottawa,</v>

4105
01:42:00.530 --> 01:42:04.010
<v Speaker 4>which is more mixed Montreals mostly French and a French and English,</v>

4106
01:42:04.011 --> 01:42:04.844
<v Speaker 4>but they're not,</v>

4107
01:42:05.540 --> 01:42:08.120
<v Speaker 4>they're not under the auspices of the crown by any stretch.</v>

4108
01:42:09.230 --> 01:42:10.063
<v Speaker 4>Ottawa,</v>

4109
01:42:10.370 --> 01:42:10.880
<v Speaker 4>it a little bit,</v>

4110
01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:11.121
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4111
01:42:11.121 --> 01:42:11.954
<v Speaker 4>laugh,</v>

4112
01:42:12.020 --> 01:42:12.860
<v Speaker 4>mild applause,</v>

4113
01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:14.840
<v Speaker 4>Toronto and nothing.</v>

4114
01:42:15.560 --> 01:42:16.011
<v Speaker 4>Nothing.</v>

4115
01:42:16.011 --> 01:42:17.500
<v Speaker 4>Not a fucking sound.</v>

4116
01:42:18.370 --> 01:42:18.530
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4117
01:42:18.530 --> 01:42:18.741
<v Speaker 4>it did.</v>

4118
01:42:18.741 --> 01:42:22.580
<v Speaker 4>An American would have the arrogance to come up and do something against the</v>

4119
01:42:22.581 --> 01:42:24.470
<v Speaker 4>Queen and that funny,</v>

4120
01:42:24.620 --> 01:42:25.970
<v Speaker 4>like the same fucking job,</v>

4121
01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:27.150
<v Speaker 4>just a couple of hundred miles</v>

4122
01:42:27.150 --> 01:42:27.960
<v Speaker 1>west boom.</v>

4123
01:42:27.960 --> 01:42:32.910
<v Speaker 1>Now it's very weird when you see people that are really like it taken into the</v>

4124
01:42:32.940 --> 01:42:34.380
<v Speaker 1>royal family thing.</v>

4125
01:42:34.410 --> 01:42:36.350
<v Speaker 1>The oils like leave the royals,</v>

4126
01:42:36.400 --> 01:42:38.550
<v Speaker 1>they live their lives that they read about them,</v>

4127
01:42:38.551 --> 01:42:40.350
<v Speaker 1>like as if their thoughts are more,</v>

4128
01:42:40.380 --> 01:42:41.250
<v Speaker 1>more important.</v>

4129
01:42:41.251 --> 01:42:41.850
<v Speaker 1>And yeah,</v>

4130
01:42:41.850 --> 01:42:42.141
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

4131
01:42:42.141 --> 01:42:45.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm making fun of the Queen when I was,</v>

4132
01:42:45.091 --> 01:42:45.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4133
01:42:45.390 --> 01:42:46.890
<v Speaker 1>when I was in England one time,</v>

4134
01:42:46.950 --> 01:42:48.720
<v Speaker 1>I forgot which town were around,</v>

4135
01:42:49.200 --> 01:42:50.460
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't like London,</v>

4136
01:42:50.730 --> 01:42:51.151
<v Speaker 1>London.</v>

4137
01:42:51.151 --> 01:42:52.500
<v Speaker 1>They probably would have laughed their asses off,</v>

4138
01:42:52.501 --> 01:42:53.590
<v Speaker 1>but these people were like,</v>

4139
01:42:53.790 --> 01:42:54.121
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

4140
01:42:54.121 --> 01:42:55.400
<v Speaker 1>you gotta Watch Manchester.</v>

4141
01:42:55.460 --> 01:42:57.270
<v Speaker 1>While I don't remember what town it was.</v>

4142
01:42:57.410 --> 01:42:58.440
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't Manchester.</v>

4143
01:42:58.680 --> 01:42:59.550
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it was new castle,</v>

4144
01:42:59.650 --> 01:43:00.483
<v Speaker 1>maybe was Newcastle.</v>

4145
01:43:00.540 --> 01:43:01.020
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

4146
01:43:01.020 --> 01:43:01.860

4153
01:43:17.370 --> 01:43:17.551
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

4187
01:44:06.170 --> 01:44:06.770
<v Speaker 1>they went with it.</v>

4188
01:44:06.770 --> 01:44:07.281
<v Speaker 1>They went with it.</v>

4189
01:44:07.281 --> 01:44:07.910
<v Speaker 1>Eventually,</v>

4190
01:44:07.910 --> 01:44:08.750
<v Speaker 1>eventually I beat,</v>

4191

4196
01:44:14.691 --> 01:44:18.650
<v Speaker 1>You don't need the ancestors of the people who suppressed your ancestors and</v>

4197
01:44:18.651 --> 01:44:19.910
<v Speaker 1>give them some special favors.</v>

4198
01:44:19.911 --> 01:44:20.744
<v Speaker 1>This is crazy.</v>

4199

<v Speaker 1>the Middle Eastern guys,</v>

4240
01:45:27.111 --> 01:45:29.840
<v Speaker 1>they rock it the right way when they want to go balls out.</v>

4241
01:45:29.870 --> 01:45:30.021
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4242
01:45:30.021 --> 01:45:30.600
<v Speaker 1>they do it.</v>

4243
01:45:30.600 --> 01:45:35.600
<v Speaker 1>I would pay girls hundreds of thousands of dollars to be sex slaves and then</v>

4244
01:45:36.471 --> 01:45:38.330
<v Speaker 1>they have definitely,</v>

4245
01:45:38.710 --> 01:45:40.610
<v Speaker 1>cause you're not judged as much.</v>

4246

4268
01:46:22.641 --> 01:46:23.474
<v Speaker 1>It's old shit.</v>

4269
01:46:23.600 --> 01:46:24.620
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>

01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:27.350
<v Speaker 1>There's those guys have so much money that this guy,</v>

4271
01:46:27.500 --> 01:46:27.891
<v Speaker 1>the salt,</v>

4272
01:46:27.891 --> 01:46:30.020
<v Speaker 1>no Brunei apparently has a disco in his house,</v>

4273
01:46:30.990 --> 01:46:31.791
<v Speaker 1>makes his own discount,</v>

4274
01:46:31.791 --> 01:46:32.690
<v Speaker 1>which is beautiful.</v>

4275
01:46:32.720 --> 01:46:37.720
<v Speaker 1>Unbelievably lavishly appointed disco gold gilded work on the ceiling and</v>

4276
01:46:38.560 --> 01:46:41.920
<v Speaker 1>magnificent and just filled with tens.</v>

4277
01:46:42.170 --> 01:46:47.170
<v Speaker 1>She's tens everywhere and this guy just goes out there and slides amongst them.</v>

4278
01:46:47.211 --> 01:46:51.120
<v Speaker 1>It has a cocktail mingles mixes with the next group or they're all trying to</v>

4279
01:46:51.121 --> 01:46:53.100
<v Speaker 1>impress him and they're all trying to compete.</v>

4280
01:46:53.130 --> 01:46:54.450
<v Speaker 1>And it was him and a few of his friends,</v>

4281
01:46:54.451 --> 01:46:55.040
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

4282
01:46:55.040 --> 01:46:57.030
<v Speaker 1>I think it just fucking bang them.</v>

4283
01:46:57.240 --> 01:47:02.240
<v Speaker 1>Just walk every night and every night he's fishing in this stock pond.</v>

4284
01:47:02.910 --> 01:47:03.151
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4285
01:47:03.151 --> 01:47:03.930
<v Speaker 1>it's really the,</v>

4286
01:47:03.930 --> 01:47:07.020
<v Speaker 1>nobody's ever been such a baller because he's not,</v>

4287
01:47:07.200 --> 01:47:09.540
<v Speaker 1>he's not actually enslaving anybody.</v>

4288
01:47:09.541 --> 01:47:11.610
<v Speaker 1>He's paying them significant amounts of money.</v>

4289
01:47:11.790 --> 01:47:12.121
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

4290
01:47:12.121 --> 01:47:13.560
<v Speaker 1>He's not corrupting their morals.</v>

4291
01:47:13.740 --> 01:47:14.730
<v Speaker 1>They're willing to do this.</v>

4292
01:47:14.760 --> 01:47:15.220
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4293
01:47:15.220 --> 01:47:18.740
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing wrong with the exchange because the amount of money to make an</v>

4294
01:47:18.750 --> 01:47:20.400
<v Speaker 1>is really fucking staggering.</v>

4295
01:47:20.880 --> 01:47:24.300
<v Speaker 1>But when you really stop and think about like how many guys have ever done it</v>

4296
01:47:24.301 --> 01:47:24.960
<v Speaker 1>like that?</v>

4297
01:47:24.960 --> 01:47:26.940
<v Speaker 1>The Sultan of Brunei is probably doing it the nicest.</v>

4298
01:47:26.980 --> 01:47:29.070
<v Speaker 1>Wherever everybody else who did it,</v>

4299
01:47:29.190 --> 01:47:30.240
<v Speaker 1>they did it with armies.</v>

4300
01:47:30.420 --> 01:47:30.840
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4301
01:47:30.840 --> 01:47:31.081
<v Speaker 1>every,</v>

4302
01:47:31.081 --> 01:47:32.700
<v Speaker 1>every other guy that's like lived like that,</v>

4303
01:47:32.701 --> 01:47:34.790
<v Speaker 1>they did it with swords and you know,</v>

4304
01:47:34.800 --> 01:47:37.800
<v Speaker 1>conquering towns and keeping chicks in cages and shit.</v>

4305
01:47:38.100 --> 01:47:41.520
<v Speaker 1>This guy just pays him stupid amounts of money based on oil money.</v>

4306
01:47:41.760 --> 01:47:42.593
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

4307
01:47:43.040 --> 01:47:43.910
<v Speaker 4>That sounds like fun.</v>

4308
01:47:44.240 --> 01:47:44.491
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4309
01:47:44.491 --> 01:47:49.430
<v Speaker 4>I think pre Prince Charles is kind of sad because he's at the point now where</v>

4310
01:47:49.431 --> 01:47:49.731
<v Speaker 4>he's like,</v>

4311
01:47:49.731 --> 01:47:50.541
<v Speaker 4>he loves his mother,</v>

4312
01:47:50.541 --> 01:47:50.990
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

4313
01:47:50.990 --> 01:47:51.351
<v Speaker 4>mom,</v>

4314
01:47:51.351 --> 01:47:52.430
<v Speaker 4>could you die already?</v>

4315
01:47:52.490 --> 01:47:56.580
<v Speaker 4>So it can be King Charles to be king before I'm 70 do you know if she lives to a</v>

4316
01:47:56.581 --> 01:47:58.880
<v Speaker 4>hundred you know what the fuck's going to happen to him?</v>

4317
01:47:59.180 --> 01:47:59.720
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4318
01:47:59.720 --> 01:48:00.560
<v Speaker 4>She might outlive live him.</v>

4319
01:48:00.860 --> 01:48:01.250
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4320
01:48:01.250 --> 01:48:02.090
<v Speaker 4>it's possible.</v>

4321
01:48:02.120 --> 01:48:02.953
<v Speaker 4>Oh sure.</v>

4322
01:48:03.740 --> 01:48:05.180
<v Speaker 4>You know who's under more stress?</v>

4323
01:48:05.330 --> 01:48:05.480
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

4324
01:48:05.480 --> 01:48:07.190

4425
01:50:09.870 --> 01:50:14.400
<v Speaker 1>I paid two nights in a row because dom could make in one night and his plane was</v>

4426
01:50:14.580 --> 01:50:15.840
<v Speaker 1>delayed or something like that.</v>

4427
01:50:15.900 --> 01:50:16.860
<v Speaker 1>And Denis Leary,</v>

4428
01:50:16.950 --> 01:50:17.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4429
01:50:17.280 --> 01:50:19.680
<v Speaker 1>went up and that's how I found out about Denis leary.</v>

4430
01:50:20.790 --> 01:50:23.040
<v Speaker 1>And Denis leary became my favorite comedian for six months.</v>

4431
01:50:23.550 --> 01:50:24.020
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>

4432
01:50:24.020 --> 01:50:24.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4433
01:50:24.390 --> 01:50:24.931
<v Speaker 1>I paid,</v>

4434
01:50:24.931 --> 01:50:25.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4435
01:50:25.410 --> 01:50:27.780
<v Speaker 1>we had some good shows on there where before we were ever friends.</v>

4436
01:50:28.430 --> 01:50:29.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4437
01:50:29.030 --> 01:50:30.660
<v Speaker 1>That place is a classic place.</v>

4438
01:50:30.750 --> 01:50:31.650
<v Speaker 1>So these people,</v>

4439
01:50:31.660 --> 01:50:32.450
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4440
01:50:32.450 --> 01:50:34.710
<v Speaker 1>did they get fired or did they quit?</v>

4441
01:50:35.450 --> 01:50:35.691
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

4442
01:50:35.691 --> 01:50:36.111
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

4443
01:50:36.111 --> 01:50:36.640
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

4444
01:50:36.640 --> 01:50:39.930
<v Speaker 5>they said that they were going to leave the radio show until,</v>

4445
01:50:40.200 --> 01:50:40.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4446
01:50:40.650 --> 01:50:40.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4447
01:50:40.980 --> 01:50:43.200
<v Speaker 1>kind of tell a ship blows over.</v>

4448
01:50:43.201 --> 01:50:46.950
<v Speaker 1>It's a tough place to rebound to cause such a small country if not in size,</v>

4449
01:50:46.951 --> 01:50:47.820
<v Speaker 1>but in population.</v>

4450
01:50:49.440 --> 01:50:50.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you can blame that.</v>

4451
01:50:50.530 --> 01:50:51.420
<v Speaker 1>Know the guy.</v>

4452
01:50:51.421 --> 01:50:52.590
<v Speaker 1>They're just trying to be funny.</v>

4453
01:50:53.400 --> 01:50:54.320
<v Speaker 1>If somebody would kill them.</v>

4454
01:50:54.330 --> 01:50:57.390
<v Speaker 1>So they thought that they would like have a conversation with somebody who would</v>

4455
01:50:57.391 --> 01:50:58.170
<v Speaker 1>it be silly?</v>

4456
01:50:58.170 --> 01:50:58.471
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4457
01:50:58.471 --> 01:51:00.060
<v Speaker 1>they've done that before with other people.</v>

4458
01:51:00.090 --> 01:51:00.810
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4459
01:51:00.810 --> 01:51:02.460
<v Speaker 1>they did one of those with Sarah Pailin.</v>

4460
01:51:02.461 --> 01:51:03.450
<v Speaker 1>Remember those Canadian guys?</v>

4461
01:51:03.451 --> 01:51:04.680
<v Speaker 1>They called and they told Sarah Palin,</v>

4462
01:51:04.800 --> 01:51:05.633
<v Speaker 1>Sarah Palin,</v>

4463
01:51:05.670 --> 01:51:05.890
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4464
01:51:05.890 --> 01:51:06.960
<v Speaker 1>nobody killed anybody,</v>

4465
01:51:07.140 --> 01:51:08.190
<v Speaker 1>and so they were okay,</v>

4466
01:51:08.191 --> 01:51:10.770
<v Speaker 1>but that this is not okay because the lady kills herself.</v>

4467
01:51:10.820 --> 01:51:11.181
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

4468
01:51:11.181 --> 01:51:11.701
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

4469
01:51:11.701 --> 01:51:12.421
<v Speaker 1>It's craziness,</v>

4470
01:51:12.421 --> 01:51:12.930
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4471
01:51:12.930 --> 01:51:14.190
<v Speaker 1>You can't blame these people.</v>

4472
01:51:14.280 --> 01:51:15.240
<v Speaker 1>You can say,</v>

4473
01:51:15.570 --> 01:51:15.871
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

4474

4475
01:51:17.311 --> 01:51:17.730
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

4476
01:51:17.730 --> 01:51:19.530
<v Speaker 1>I don't think these people should even be fired.</v>

4477
01:51:19.740 --> 01:51:21.720
<v Speaker 1>It's really what they did was not a bad thing.</v>

4478
01:51:22.080 --> 01:51:23.370
<v Speaker 1>It was a silly thing,</v>

4479
01:51:23.520 --> 01:51:24.540
<v Speaker 1>but it's not a bad thing.</v>

4480
01:51:24.660 --> 01:51:27.120
<v Speaker 1>The woman was in the hospital because she wasn't feeling well.</v>

4481
01:51:27.121 --> 01:51:27.871
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like,</v>

4482
01:51:27.871 --> 01:51:28.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4483
01:51:28.440 --> 01:51:31.560
<v Speaker 1>like there had been some horrible accident and they were keeping medical</v>

4484
01:51:31.561 --> 01:51:34.920
<v Speaker 1>attention from her that was going to save her life and it led to her death.</v>

4485
01:51:34.950 --> 01:51:37.440
<v Speaker 1>There was no obstruction of health services.</v>

4486
01:51:37.650 --> 01:51:39.030
<v Speaker 1>It was just a silly thing.</v>

4487
01:51:39.240 --> 01:51:41.230
<v Speaker 1>You can't blame these people for a fucking site.</v>

4488
01:51:41.520 --> 01:51:41.701
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

01:51:41.701 --> 01:51:43.470
<v Speaker 1>you don't know it's going to backfire that much.</v>

4490
01:51:43.471 --> 01:51:45.240
<v Speaker 1>It's a bunch of pussies.</v>

4496
01:51:53.101 --> 01:51:57.300
<v Speaker 1>but he won't let anyone on his crew eat any animals either.</v>

4497
01:51:57.390 --> 01:51:59.850
<v Speaker 1>So the crew guys will like get together,</v>

01:51:59.851 --> 01:52:03.060
<v Speaker 1>they'll meet and one guy's room and they order a bunch of Burgers for room</v>

<v Speaker 1>service and they hide and one guy watches the door.</v>

01:52:09.120 --> 01:52:12.540

4504
01:52:12.541 --> 01:52:12.930
<v Speaker 1>room.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And now,</v>

4561
01:53:30.030 --> 01:53:31.850
<v Speaker 1>apparently 20 years later,</v>

<v Speaker 1>they've got restraining orders against each other for domestic abuse.</v>

4567
01:53:38.361 --> 01:53:39.650
<v Speaker 1>They both have restraining orders</v>

4568
01:53:43.030 --> 01:53:43.510

<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

4570

<v Speaker 1>he's got,</v>

4571
01:53:44.991 --> 01:53:47.410
<v Speaker 1>he became like Joe Piscopo.</v>

4572
01:53:47.420 --> 01:53:51.820
<v Speaker 1>It became like this weird sort of a caricature of who he used to make fun of it.</v>

4573
01:53:51.870 --> 01:53:52.431
<v Speaker 1>Like that whole,</v>

4574
01:53:52.431 --> 01:53:53.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm from Jersey,</v>

4575
01:53:53.630 --> 01:53:57.380
<v Speaker 1>well now it's like he's really weird become that.</v>

01:53:57.410 --> 01:53:57.621
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4577
01:53:57.621 --> 01:53:59.900
<v Speaker 1>And he tells like these joke episcopal shows,</v>

4578
01:53:59.901 --> 01:54:03.620
<v Speaker 1>his live shows places and you fills up these really small places and he's,</v>

4579
01:54:03.800 --> 01:54:04.101
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4580

<v Speaker 1>kinda scratching by and try to it.</v>

4581
01:54:06.020 --> 01:54:09.590
<v Speaker 1>And it's weird like hearing him get fucked with by Opie and Anthony.</v>

4582
01:54:09.591 --> 01:54:11.030
<v Speaker 1>It was like really painful.</v>

4583
01:54:11.031 --> 01:54:11.420
<v Speaker 1>Like they were.</v>

4584
01:54:11.420 --> 01:54:11.870
<v Speaker 1>Why would he,</v>

4585
01:54:11.870 --> 01:54:12.800
<v Speaker 1>why would he do the show?</v>

4586
01:54:12.820 --> 01:54:13.460
<v Speaker 1>Cause it gets,</v>

4587
01:54:13.460 --> 01:54:15.770
<v Speaker 1>it gets people paying attention to them when people go see him.</v>

4588
01:54:16.190 --> 01:54:17.300
<v Speaker 1>Even as a goof.</v>

4589
01:54:17.690 --> 01:54:18.051
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4590
01:54:18.051 --> 01:54:18.410
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

4591
01:54:18.410 --> 01:54:20.750
<v Speaker 1>I would go see it if I knew that he was going to be in town.</v>

4592
01:54:20.780 --> 01:54:21.471
<v Speaker 1>I would go see it.</v>

4593
01:54:21.471 --> 01:54:22.011
<v Speaker 1>I would go see it.</v>

4594
01:54:22.011 --> 01:54:22.844
<v Speaker 1>Even if I'm,</v>

4595
01:54:22.890 --> 01:54:24.830
<v Speaker 1>I will go see a lot of things that I,</v>

4596
01:54:25.220 --> 01:54:26.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure I'm going to suck.</v>

4597
01:54:27.160 --> 01:54:27.501
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4598
01:54:27.501 --> 01:54:30.380
<v Speaker 1>if it's going to be an inexperienced comedically though,</v>

4599
01:54:30.381 --> 01:54:31.220
<v Speaker 1>you could sit through it.</v>

4600
01:54:31.490 --> 01:54:32.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's comedy.</v>

4601
01:54:33.130 --> 01:54:34.820
<v Speaker 1>I think he's like singing thank,</v>

4602
01:54:34.840 --> 01:54:35.870
<v Speaker 1>he's like singing songs.</v>

4603
01:54:35.871 --> 01:54:36.201
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

4604
01:54:36.201 --> 01:54:36.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

4605
01:54:36.620 --> 01:54:38.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't really think he's doing comedy.</v>

4606
01:54:38.660 --> 01:54:41.990
<v Speaker 1>I think he's doing like a lot of Sinatra songs and shit like that really did</v>

4607
01:54:41.991 --> 01:54:42.501
<v Speaker 1>stand up.</v>

4608
01:54:42.501 --> 01:54:46.530
<v Speaker 1>He did character pressures of the sports caster.</v>

4609
01:54:46.840 --> 01:54:47.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm an entertainer.</v>

4610
01:54:47.720 --> 01:54:48.553
<v Speaker 1>I'm an entertainer.</v>

4611
01:54:48.890 --> 01:54:49.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm a triple threat,</v>

4612
01:54:49.700 --> 01:54:50.600
<v Speaker 1>but having him,</v>

4643
01:55:30.050 --> 01:55:31.420
<v Speaker 1>The reasons I started doing standup,</v>

4644
01:55:31.421 --> 01:55:33.070
<v Speaker 1>that was hilarious because he was so bad.</v>

4645
01:55:33.250 --> 01:55:36.400
<v Speaker 1>I was getting hired for Saturday night live and they,</v>

4646
01:55:36.490 --> 01:55:38.380
<v Speaker 1>cause Eddie Murphy like Joe,</v>

4647
01:55:38.710 --> 01:55:40.000
<v Speaker 1>the only two people that kept,</v>

4648
01:55:40.001 --> 01:55:41.070
<v Speaker 1>I got hired by shine that lap.</v>

4649
01:55:41.080 --> 01:55:44.340
<v Speaker 1>They change producers and Eddie Murphy</v>

4650
01:55:44.370 --> 01:55:44.881
<v Speaker 4>like Joe,</v>

4651
01:55:44.881 --> 01:55:47.970
<v Speaker 4>they were friends and they kept Joe because of Eddie.</v>

4652
01:55:48.450 --> 01:55:48.931
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

4653
01:55:48.931 --> 01:55:51.360
<v Speaker 4>Joe was fine on the show it on him and put him down.</v>

4654
01:55:51.361 --> 01:55:52.194
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

4655
01:55:52.320 --> 01:55:53.101
<v Speaker 4>I thought to myself,</v>

4656
01:55:53.101 --> 01:55:53.820
<v Speaker 4>fuck this,</v>

4657
01:55:53.820 --> 01:55:54.840
<v Speaker 4>I can do that.</v>

4658
01:55:54.841 --> 01:55:55.740
<v Speaker 4>I could do stand up,</v>

4659
01:55:56.300 --> 01:55:56.610
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4660
01:55:56.610 --> 01:56:01.020
<v Speaker 4>I became a standard cause I didn't want to deal with the fucking agents and Shit</v>

4661
01:56:01.021 --> 01:56:01.740
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

4662
01:56:01.740 --> 01:56:03.570
<v Speaker 4>policy or was this 1980.</v>

4663
01:56:04.050 --> 01:56:04.531
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

4664
01:56:04.531 --> 01:56:09.150
<v Speaker 4>So that's when you started standing up best at the Improv and sad passed right</v>

4665
01:56:09.151 --> 01:56:11.230
<v Speaker 4>away because I was already a polished performer,</v>

4666
01:56:11.260 --> 01:56:12.020
<v Speaker 4>not to be a jerk,</v>

4667
01:56:12.020 --> 01:56:17.020
<v Speaker 4>but I had done so much acting and Improv that stand up all I was really okay.</v>

4668
01:56:17.881 --> 01:56:21.090
<v Speaker 4>I just had no act and I couldn't understand how standards had to repeat</v>

4669
01:56:21.091 --> 01:56:21.870
<v Speaker 4>themselves to,</v>

4670
01:56:21.870 --> 01:56:22.703
<v Speaker 4>to hone it.</v>

4671
01:56:22.950 --> 01:56:24.210
<v Speaker 4>That was the tough part for me,</v>

4672
01:56:24.211 --> 01:56:24.570
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4673
01:56:24.570 --> 01:56:27.640
<v Speaker 4>so pissed Capone never did a stand up and he did,</v>

4674
01:56:28.290 --> 01:56:30.160
<v Speaker 4>but he used to do this thing where he'd come in and like,</v>

4675
01:56:30.161 --> 01:56:30.760
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4676
01:56:30.760 --> 01:56:32.400
<v Speaker 4>you could see right through it and then he'd go,</v>

4677
01:56:32.730 --> 01:56:33.511
<v Speaker 4>hey everybody,</v>

4678
01:56:33.511 --> 01:56:34.860
<v Speaker 4>I just stopped in to say hello.</v>

4679
01:56:35.370 --> 01:56:35.581
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

4680
01:56:35.581 --> 01:56:36.391
<v Speaker 4>And they'd be clapping,</v>

4681
01:56:36.391 --> 01:56:36.541
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4682
01:56:36.541 --> 01:56:37.081
<v Speaker 4>like in other words,</v>

4683
01:56:37.081 --> 01:56:37.831
<v Speaker 4>I'm saying hello,</v>

4684
01:56:37.831 --> 01:56:38.760
<v Speaker 4>which is good enough.</v>

4685
01:56:38.780 --> 01:56:39.960
<v Speaker 4>Now if I happen to be funny,</v>

4686
01:56:40.380 --> 01:56:40.831
<v Speaker 4>great,</v>

4687
01:56:40.831 --> 01:56:43.280
<v Speaker 4>but don't expect me to be funny because once I didn't live,</v>

4688
01:56:43.760 --> 01:56:45.320
<v Speaker 4>oh see that's what he would say.</v>

4689
01:56:46.470 --> 01:56:47.210
<v Speaker 4>Hello.</v>

4690
01:56:47.210 --> 01:56:47.790
<v Speaker 4>Famous.</v>

4691
01:56:47.790 --> 01:56:48.541
<v Speaker 4>How famous was he?</v>

4692
01:56:48.541 --> 01:56:49.680
<v Speaker 4>At one point I was really famous.</v>

4693
01:56:50.010 --> 01:56:52.050
<v Speaker 4>He was famous enough to be on Saturday night live,</v>

4694
01:56:52.051 --> 01:56:52.351
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4695
01:56:52.351 --> 01:56:52.801
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>

4696
01:56:52.801 --> 01:56:53.850
<v Speaker 4>He was a pretty big name.</v>

4697
01:56:53.851 --> 01:56:54.601
<v Speaker 4>I know who he is.</v>

4698
01:56:54.601 --> 01:56:54.841
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4699
01:56:54.841 --> 01:56:56.190
<v Speaker 4>I knew who he is when I was in high school,</v>

4700
01:56:56.191 --> 01:56:56.850
<v Speaker 4>so he must be,</v>

4701
01:56:56.850 --> 01:56:58.020
<v Speaker 4>he must have been really famous.</v>

4702
01:56:58.140 --> 01:56:58.771
<v Speaker 4>That was the 80s.</v>

4703
01:56:58.771 --> 01:57:03.210
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't one that was 80 for 80 on that was a few years after that.</v>

4704
01:57:03.211 --> 01:57:04.830
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember what happened to him after that.</v>

4705
01:57:05.170 --> 01:57:05.630
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

4706
01:57:05.630 --> 01:57:06.690
<v Speaker 4>he's always a nice guy,</v>

4707
01:57:06.750 --> 01:57:07.111
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4708
01:57:07.111 --> 01:57:07.381
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4709
01:57:07.381 --> 01:57:07.831
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

4710
01:57:07.831 --> 01:57:08.664
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4711
01:57:08.850 --> 01:57:10.320
<v Speaker 4>I don't think standup was his thing.</v>

4712
01:57:10.350 --> 01:57:13.300
<v Speaker 4>He was listening to Ona town apartments.</v>

4713
01:57:13.510 --> 01:57:14.400
<v Speaker 4>So brutal.</v>

4714
01:57:14.430 --> 01:57:14.551
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4715
01:57:14.551 --> 01:57:15.600
<v Speaker 4>he's from a different era,</v>

4716
01:57:15.850 --> 01:57:16.191
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4717
01:57:16.191 --> 01:57:16.370
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>

4718
01:57:16.370 --> 01:57:16.680
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>

4719
01:57:16.680 --> 01:57:19.170
<v Speaker 4>we're a Sinatra era kind of.</v>

4720
01:57:19.260 --> 01:57:19.681
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4721
01:57:19.681 --> 01:57:21.090
<v Speaker 4>And then even though he's younger than that,</v>

4722
01:57:21.180 --> 01:57:22.770
<v Speaker 4>reading his tweets about it,</v>

4723
01:57:22.771 --> 01:57:23.101
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4724
01:57:23.101 --> 01:57:23.570
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

4725
01:57:23.570 --> 01:57:25.870
<v Speaker 4>like trying to like sort of justify it and everything.</v>

4726
01:57:25.871 --> 01:57:26.704
<v Speaker 4>It's just like,</v>

4727
01:57:26.910 --> 01:57:27.743
<v Speaker 4>he's like,</v>

4728
01:57:27.870 --> 01:57:31.230
<v Speaker 4>he sacrifices himself so he can get that attention,</v>

4729
01:57:31.231 --> 01:57:33.690
<v Speaker 4>but that is really the only attention that he's getting really.</v>

4730
01:57:33.691 --> 01:57:34.950
<v Speaker 4>If you stop and think about it without,</v>

4731
01:57:34.980 --> 01:57:36.000
<v Speaker 4>without that kind of stuff,</v>

4732
01:57:36.001 --> 01:57:36.840
<v Speaker 4>without opie and Anthony,</v>

4733
01:57:37.020 --> 01:57:38.340
<v Speaker 4>they mean they really are helping them out.</v>

<v Speaker 4>And Jim Norton actually like put it on his,</v>

<v Speaker 4>his tweet,</v>

4737
01:57:41.221 --> 01:57:41.400
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

4738
01:57:41.400 --> 01:57:41.551
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

4739
01:57:41.551 --> 01:57:41.991
<v Speaker 4>go see you.</v>

4740
01:57:41.991 --> 01:57:42.824

01:57:42.870 --> 01:57:43.740
<v Speaker 4>he's such a good guy.</v>

4742
01:57:45.210 --> 01:57:46.440
<v Speaker 4>He's a great guy.</v>

4743
01:57:46.441 --> 01:57:47.160
<v Speaker 4>He really is.</v>

4744
01:57:47.160 --> 01:57:48.240
<v Speaker 4>He's my favorite performer.</v>

4745
01:57:48.690 --> 01:57:52.090
<v Speaker 4>He is because he's so unabashed and unapologetic about it.</v>

4746
01:57:52.390 --> 01:57:54.120
<v Speaker 4>He talks about like Midi pussies.</v>

4747
01:57:54.500 --> 01:57:55.110
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

4748
01:57:55.110 --> 01:57:57.580
<v Speaker 4>you could see like it's a little hands get sweaty and his pod,</v>

4749
01:57:57.581 --> 01:57:58.680
<v Speaker 4>he starts squirming,</v>

4750
01:57:58.681 --> 01:58:00.630
<v Speaker 4>gets him getting dumped on that.</v>

4751
01:58:00.760 --> 01:58:01.470
<v Speaker 4>That makes,</v>

4752
01:58:01.470 --> 01:58:03.060
<v Speaker 4>that even makes me uncomfortable.</v>

4753
01:58:04.830 --> 01:58:05.221
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4754
01:58:05.221 --> 01:58:05.761
<v Speaker 4>he's a,</v>

4755
01:58:05.761 --> 01:58:06.960
<v Speaker 4>he's not playing it clean.</v>

4756
01:58:07.380 --> 01:58:08.610

4784
01:58:43.381 --> 01:58:44.340
<v Speaker 4>Tom Cruise or whatever.</v>

4785
01:58:44.610 --> 01:58:46.080
<v Speaker 4>Somebody who's supposed to be good looking.</v>

4786
01:58:46.260 --> 01:58:47.430
<v Speaker 4>You don't see Jim Norton.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Nice.</v>

4795
01:58:54.931 --> 01:58:55.591
<v Speaker 4>A little puffy,</v>

4796
01:58:55.591 --> 01:58:56.100
<v Speaker 4>overweight.</v>

4797
01:58:56.100 --> 01:58:56.521
<v Speaker 4>I like that.</v>

4798
01:58:56.521 --> 01:58:57.354
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

4800
01:59:00.300 --> 01:59:02.130
<v Speaker 4>Merera the video that we had on earlier,</v>

4805
01:59:10.410 --> 01:59:11.850

4806
01:59:11.851 --> 01:59:12.510
<v Speaker 4>or his book.</v>

4807
01:59:12.510 --> 01:59:13.343
<v Speaker 4>I think his book,</v>

4808
01:59:15.030 --> 01:59:15.810
<v Speaker 4>he's funny.</v>

4809
01:59:15.810 --> 01:59:17.060
<v Speaker 4>He's a juvenile jail.</v>

4810
01:59:17.400 --> 01:59:19.290
<v Speaker 4>The problem is they have a Deli platter right at the end.</v>

4818
01:59:31.230 --> 01:59:33.180

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

01:59:35.010 --> 01:59:36.330

01:59:38.881 --> 01:59:40.770
<v Speaker 4>What did Christopher Hitchens say when he,</v>

4826
01:59:40.771 --> 01:59:40.980
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4827
01:59:40.980 --> 01:59:42.080
<v Speaker 4>he got cancer and died.</v>

4828
01:59:42.090 --> 01:59:44.070
<v Speaker 4>He said he burnt the candle at both ends.</v>

4829
01:59:44.071 --> 01:59:44.660
<v Speaker 4>But what a,</v>

4830
01:59:44.660 --> 01:59:46.050
<v Speaker 4>what a lovely glow it made.</v>

4831
01:59:48.900 --> 01:59:50.370
<v Speaker 4>I don't burn it at both ends cause I,</v>

4832
01:59:50.490 --> 01:59:51.570
<v Speaker 4>I get plenty of rest,</v>

4833
01:59:51.950 --> 01:59:52.783
<v Speaker 4>so that's okay.</v>

4834
01:59:53.370 --> 01:59:54.240
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying it's okay,</v>

4835
01:59:54.241 --> 01:59:55.450
<v Speaker 4>but it's better than not rest.</v>

4836
01:59:55.451 --> 01:59:57.330
<v Speaker 4>And to take care of your health at all.</v>

02:05:59.631 --> 02:05:59.871
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

5099
02:05:59.871 --> 02:06:00.704
<v Speaker 1>I've done Tampa.</v>

5100
02:06:00.950 --> 02:06:01.783
<v Speaker 1>Bobby jewels.</v>

5101
02:06:02.060 --> 02:06:02.691
<v Speaker 1>I did know,</v>

5102
02:06:02.691 --> 02:06:03.800
<v Speaker 1>I did all the Improv,</v>

5103
02:06:04.100 --> 02:06:06.470
<v Speaker 1>the improvement side splitters.</v>

5104
02:06:06.530 --> 02:06:07.520
<v Speaker 1>My folks used to live out there.</v>

5105
02:06:07.521 --> 02:06:11.030
<v Speaker 1>They still live in Clearwater where all the scientists Scientologists are.</v>

5106
02:06:11.690 --> 02:06:12.770
<v Speaker 1>That's where the Phillies train.</v>

5107
02:06:13.340 --> 02:06:13.941
<v Speaker 1>If it matters,</v>

5108
02:06:13.941 --> 02:06:15.200
<v Speaker 1>maybe they're Scientologists too.</v>

5109
02:06:15.290 --> 02:06:16.280
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's why they do so well.</v>

5110
02:06:16.310 --> 02:06:19.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing that in January with his Knoxville club,</v>

5111
02:06:19.731 --> 02:06:24.110
<v Speaker 1>which is funny because I can't draw a fucking person in Nashville and Knoxville.</v>

5112
02:06:24.111 --> 02:06:25.220
<v Speaker 1>He sold out Nashville.</v>

5113
02:06:25.250 --> 02:06:26.083
<v Speaker 1>Tricky.</v>

5114
02:06:26.210 --> 02:06:27.670
<v Speaker 1>Why would I sell that Knoxville?</v>

5115
02:06:27.930 --> 02:06:31.280
<v Speaker 1>But Nashville is a particularly tricky apparently for comedy.</v>

5116
02:06:31.420 --> 02:06:31.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5117
02:06:31.830 --> 02:06:32.663
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why.</v>

5118
02:06:32.890 --> 02:06:33.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5119
02:06:33.080 --> 02:06:33.231
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

5120
02:06:33.231 --> 02:06:33.451
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

5121
02:06:33.451 --> 02:06:34.580
<v Speaker 1>there are cities where it's tough.</v>

5122
02:06:34.960 --> 02:06:35.120
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5123
02:06:35.120 --> 02:06:35.301
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

5124
02:06:35.301 --> 02:06:36.140
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to,</v>

5125
02:06:36.260 --> 02:06:36.471
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5126
02:06:36.471 --> 02:06:36.821
<v Speaker 1>they don't have,</v>

5127
02:06:36.821 --> 02:06:39.710
<v Speaker 1>they don't have a comedy community and it seems like it wouldn't really make</v>

5128
02:06:39.711 --> 02:06:40.310
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>

5129
02:06:40.310 --> 02:06:40.501
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5130

<v Speaker 1>he gets,</v>

5131
02:06:40.791 --> 02:06:42.630
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't feel like it held up on music.</v>

5132
02:06:42.631 --> 02:06:42.890
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

5133
02:06:42.890 --> 02:06:43.940
<v Speaker 1>It's such a music town.</v>

02:07:51.010 --> 02:07:52.240
<v Speaker 6>He's so fucking badly.</v>

5191
02:07:52.870 --> 02:07:54.010
<v Speaker 6>He found that character</v>

5192
02:07:55.870 --> 02:07:57.970
<v Speaker 6>muscle fitness with Joe Piscopo on.</v>

5193
02:07:57.971 --> 02:08:01.510
<v Speaker 6>It looks like his head is in planted on a muscle,</v>

5194
02:08:01.511 --> 02:08:02.081
<v Speaker 6>men's body.</v>

5195
02:08:02.081 --> 02:08:05.440
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't look right while he's in fucking killer shape back then,</v>

5196
02:08:05.760 --> 02:08:06.600
<v Speaker 6>he's probably Royden.</v>

5197
02:08:06.940 --> 02:08:07.420
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah.</v>

5198
02:08:07.420 --> 02:08:08.510
<v Speaker 6>Joe Piscopo.</v>

5199
02:08:09.250 --> 02:08:13.480
<v Speaker 6>Johnny dangerously girls like trying to take him down and he's holding onto her</v>

5200
02:08:13.481 --> 02:08:13.751
<v Speaker 6>hand.</v>

5201
02:08:13.751 --> 02:08:15.190
<v Speaker 6>What kind of a fucking w what?</v>

5202
02:08:15.210 --> 02:08:16.210
<v Speaker 6>What does that statement,</v>

5203
02:08:16.211 --> 02:08:17.440
<v Speaker 6>why is she behind him?</v>

5204
02:08:17.950 --> 02:08:19.330
<v Speaker 6>She should be holding them in front of them.</v>

5205
02:08:19.480 --> 02:08:20.890
<v Speaker 6>It looks like they Photoshop the cock out.</v>

5206
02:08:20.920 --> 02:08:21.730
<v Speaker 6>It's a weird thing.</v>

5207
02:08:21.730 --> 02:08:23.280
<v Speaker 6>It's always a smooth over his deck.</v>

5208
02:08:23.320 --> 02:08:24.310
<v Speaker 6>Those were darker days.</v>

5209
02:08:25.180 --> 02:08:26.780
<v Speaker 6>People didn't have as many Cox in their life.</v>

5210
02:08:27.650 --> 02:08:28.800
<v Speaker 6>Anybody who was on the Internet.</v>

5211
02:08:28.810 --> 02:08:29.700
<v Speaker 6>That's my golden rule.</v>

5212
02:08:29.720 --> 02:08:30.190
<v Speaker 6>The Internet.</v>

5213
02:08:30.190 --> 02:08:32.020
<v Speaker 6>If you have a photo on the Internet somewhere,</v>

5214
02:08:32.021 --> 02:08:33.820
<v Speaker 6>someone has Photoshop to dick in your mouth.</v>

5215
02:08:33.850 --> 02:08:36.340
<v Speaker 6>It's just the fact there's no getting around that.</v>

5216
02:08:36.341 --> 02:08:37.630
<v Speaker 6>I think that's better for everybody.</v>

5217
02:08:38.700 --> 02:08:39.610
<v Speaker 6>I was watching this show.</v>

5218
02:08:39.611 --> 02:08:40.180
<v Speaker 6>There was talking.</v>

5219
02:08:40.180 --> 02:08:43.120
<v Speaker 6>It was that you ever watch that Morgan Freeman show through the wormhole?</v>

5220
02:08:43.570 --> 02:08:43.930
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

5221
02:08:43.930 --> 02:08:44.763
<v Speaker 6>He narrates it.</v>

5222
02:08:44.770 --> 02:08:45.603
<v Speaker 6>Oh yes.</v>

5223
02:08:45.610 --> 02:08:47.650
<v Speaker 6>It's like a Cya discovery or one of those.</v>

5224
02:08:47.680 --> 02:08:48.160
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

5225
02:08:48.160 --> 02:08:48.710
<v Speaker 6>it blows.</v>

5226
02:08:48.710 --> 02:08:51.700
<v Speaker 6>It's mind blowing if you haven't DVR did folks,</v>

5227
02:08:51.701 --> 02:08:52.960
<v Speaker 6>it's a must DVR.</v>

5228
02:08:53.170 --> 02:08:53.980
<v Speaker 6>Especially when you,</v>

5229
02:08:53.980 --> 02:08:54.311
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5230
02:08:54.311 --> 02:08:57.040
<v Speaker 6>like if you're looking for something really freaky to watch two o'clock in the</v>

5231
02:08:57.041 --> 02:09:02.041
<v Speaker 6>morning and they were talking about the fact that just by virtue of the laws of</v>

5232
02:09:02.981 --> 02:09:04.570
<v Speaker 6>probability this,</v>

5233
02:09:04.571 --> 02:09:05.010
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

5234
02:09:05.010 --> 02:09:06.430
<v Speaker 6>I think that's what they were citing.</v>

5235
02:09:06.460 --> 02:09:11.290
<v Speaker 6>That because of the fact that the universe may be infinite and what that means</v>

5236
02:09:11.291 --> 02:09:11.790
<v Speaker 6>is that,</v>

5237
02:09:11.790 --> 02:09:12.100
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5238
02:09:12.100 --> 02:09:12.661
<v Speaker 6>we have a,</v>

5239
02:09:12.661 --> 02:09:16.360
<v Speaker 6>an idea that the universe is like 14 billion years old and it started,</v>

5240
02:09:16.570 --> 02:09:17.590
<v Speaker 6>there's a lot of people,</v>

5241
02:09:17.591 --> 02:09:21.010
<v Speaker 6>a lot of these physicists that actually think that instead of it being finite,</v>

5242
02:09:21.011 --> 02:09:22.980
<v Speaker 6>like you can measure the distance of the Internet,</v>

5243
02:09:23.080 --> 02:09:24.100
<v Speaker 6>that it might be infinite.</v>

5244
02:09:24.280 --> 02:09:24.890
<v Speaker 6>And if it is,</v>

5245
02:09:24.890 --> 02:09:26.260
<v Speaker 6>and I have no idea,</v>

5246
02:09:26.261 --> 02:09:27.130
<v Speaker 6>I don't understand any of it.</v>

5247
02:09:27.160 --> 02:09:29.440
<v Speaker 6>I don't understand how it can be 14 billion years old.</v>

5248
02:09:29.560 --> 02:09:31.870
<v Speaker 6>I don't understand how it could have 14 billion.</v>

5249
02:09:32.800 --> 02:09:35.500
<v Speaker 6>I don't understand how it could have not existed in an existed.</v>

5250
02:09:35.501 --> 02:09:36.550
<v Speaker 6>I really don't understand it.</v>

5251
02:09:36.670 --> 02:09:39.940
<v Speaker 6>But what I do know is that what this guy was saying was that if the universe is</v>

5252
02:09:39.960 --> 02:09:40.630
<v Speaker 6>infinite,</v>

5253
02:09:40.630 --> 02:09:45.630
<v Speaker 6>that means there's not just one but several versions of you exactly out there</v>

5254
02:09:47.020 --> 02:09:49.690
<v Speaker 6>just because of the laws of that.</v>

5255
02:09:49.690 --> 02:09:51.970
<v Speaker 6>The fact that there's so many variables,</v>

5256
02:09:52.210 --> 02:09:54.180
<v Speaker 6>it's like it's like a they,</v>

5257
02:09:54.220 --> 02:09:56.950
<v Speaker 6>what they showed is they showed this giant pattern of rocks,</v>

5258
02:09:56.951 --> 02:10:01.840
<v Speaker 6>like this huge pile of rocks and they were showing that if you get a like this,</v>

5259
02:10:01.841 --> 02:10:03.430
<v Speaker 6>there's like one blue rock,</v>

5260
02:10:03.431 --> 02:10:04.300
<v Speaker 6>one white rock,</v>

5261
02:10:04.301 --> 02:10:05.170
<v Speaker 6>one black rock,</v>

5262
02:10:05.290 --> 02:10:10.060
<v Speaker 6>like in this order right next to each other in this massive pile of rocks,</v>

5263
02:10:10.061 --> 02:10:12.400
<v Speaker 6>you're going to have this occur x amount of times.</v>

5264
02:10:12.401 --> 02:10:13.330
<v Speaker 6>It's just inevitable.</v>

5265
02:10:13.331 --> 02:10:14.164
<v Speaker 6>It just will occur.</v>

5266
02:10:14.170 --> 02:10:17.950
<v Speaker 6>And he walks around and he picks it out and then they were starting to talk</v>

5267
02:10:17.951 --> 02:10:18.601
<v Speaker 6>about the,</v>

5268
02:10:18.601 --> 02:10:22.090
<v Speaker 6>the distance of infinity and the idea of the infinite.</v>

5269
02:10:22.120 --> 02:10:24.130
<v Speaker 6>And the idea that if that is the case,</v>

5270
02:10:24.540 --> 02:10:29.540
<v Speaker 6>there is so many possibilities that every like one,</v>

5271
02:10:30.070 --> 02:10:30.610
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5272
02:10:30.610 --> 02:10:32.690
<v Speaker 6>x amount of trillion light years,</v>

5273
02:10:33.200 --> 02:10:34.340
<v Speaker 6>there will be another</v>

5274
02:10:34.340 --> 02:10:34.611
<v Speaker 1>dom.</v>

5275
02:10:34.611 --> 02:10:35.001
<v Speaker 1>Irrera.</v>

5276
02:10:35.001 --> 02:10:35.834
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

5277
02:10:36.650 --> 02:10:36.801
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

5278
02:10:36.801 --> 02:10:37.730
<v Speaker 4>I hope you lost weight.</v>

5279
02:10:38.840 --> 02:10:39.201
<v Speaker 4>You know what,</v>

5280
02:10:39.201 --> 02:10:40.034
<v Speaker 4>I could just stop.</v>

5281
02:10:40.150 --> 02:10:40.611
<v Speaker 4>You know what?</v>

5282
02:10:40.611 --> 02:10:43.520
<v Speaker 4>I can't fathom 186,000 miles a second.</v>

5283
02:10:43.550 --> 02:10:44.840
<v Speaker 4>I believe the speed of light is,</v>

5284
02:10:45.260 --> 02:10:48.220
<v Speaker 4>and they say light years and then they say a trillion light years.</v>

5285
02:10:48.470 --> 02:10:49.660
<v Speaker 4>That's fucking unfathomed.</v>

5286
02:10:49.670 --> 02:10:51.480
<v Speaker 4>I think it was several trillion light years.</v>

5287
02:10:51.490 --> 02:10:51.670
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>

5288
02:10:51.670 --> 02:10:52.071
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

5289
02:10:52.071 --> 02:10:54.350
<v Speaker 4>hundred million light years or something like that.</v>

5290
02:10:54.440 --> 02:10:54.700
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

5291
02:10:54.700 --> 02:10:55.533
<v Speaker 4>I can't,</v>

5292
02:10:55.850 --> 02:10:56.780
<v Speaker 4>my mind can't.</v>

5293
02:10:57.220 --> 02:10:59.660
<v Speaker 4>We can't 93 million miles as a son.</v>

5294
02:10:59.720 --> 02:11:00.590
<v Speaker 4>I can understand that.</v>

5295
02:11:00.620 --> 02:11:01.311
<v Speaker 4>93 million.</v>

5296
02:11:01.311 --> 02:11:02.144
<v Speaker 4>I can deal with that.</v>

5297
02:11:02.460 --> 02:11:02.910
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

5298
02:11:02.910 --> 02:11:05.390
<v Speaker 4>the Earth is 24,000 miles around 93 million.</v>

5299
02:11:05.391 --> 02:11:05.661
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>

5300
02:11:05.661 --> 02:11:06.080
<v Speaker 4>The Sun,</v>

5301
02:11:06.080 --> 02:11:07.710
<v Speaker 4>but fucking trillion light years.</v>

5302
02:11:07.830 --> 02:11:07.921
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5303
02:11:07.921 --> 02:11:09.020
<v Speaker 1>what's really fucked up,</v>

5304
02:11:09.030 --> 02:11:09.320
<v Speaker 1>Homie,</v>

5305
02:11:09.320 --> 02:11:12.270
<v Speaker 1>me universe is that if the WWE universe is infinite,</v>

5306
02:11:12.271 --> 02:11:14.530
<v Speaker 1>when you get to 1 trillion light years,</v>

5307
02:11:14.700 --> 02:11:19.130
<v Speaker 1>you're not even like 1000000th of 1% done here.</v>

5308
02:11:19.330 --> 02:11:20.880
<v Speaker 1>Like it never ends.</v>

5309
02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:22.230
<v Speaker 1>So it doesn't matter.</v>

5310
02:11:22.231 --> 02:11:22.710
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

5311
02:11:22.710 --> 02:11:24.480
<v Speaker 1>it will go on literally forever.</v>

5312
02:11:24.510 --> 02:11:25.680
<v Speaker 1>So how can we get cocky?</v>

5313
02:11:25.950 --> 02:11:26.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

5314
02:11:26.310 --> 02:11:27.143
<v Speaker 1>How could we help people?</v>

5315
02:11:27.870 --> 02:11:28.231
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

5316
02:11:28.231 --> 02:11:30.240
<v Speaker 1>you know what's helped people get cocky cities,</v>

5317
02:11:30.630 --> 02:11:31.470
<v Speaker 1>I think lights,</v>

5318
02:11:31.730 --> 02:11:32.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5319
02:11:32.130 --> 02:11:33.060
<v Speaker 1>like light pollution,</v>

5320
02:11:33.750 --> 02:11:34.450
<v Speaker 1>security.</v>

5321
02:11:34.450 --> 02:11:35.283
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5322
02:11:35.310 --> 02:11:36.870
<v Speaker 1>I think those old cave men,</v>

5323
02:11:36.871 --> 02:11:41.871
<v Speaker 1>people like they had a great reverence to the sky because like at nighttime the</v>

5324
02:11:42.031 --> 02:11:43.140
<v Speaker 1>shit was overwhelming.</v>

5325
02:11:43.470 --> 02:11:47.910
<v Speaker 1>Like you would have Sunday time and then at nighttime they were had to be nights</v>

5326
02:11:47.940 --> 02:11:49.860
<v Speaker 1>back when there was no pollution whatsoever.</v>

5327
02:11:49.950 --> 02:11:53.360
<v Speaker 1>Especially high altitude people where they must've just seen have low.</v>

5328
02:11:53.370 --> 02:11:53.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5329
02:11:53.640 --> 02:11:54.810
<v Speaker 1>it's got to be lit up.</v>

5330
02:11:54.840 --> 02:11:55.560
<v Speaker 1>Everything.</v>

5331
02:11:55.560 --> 02:11:56.131
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

5332
02:11:56.131 --> 02:11:59.820
<v Speaker 1>the reverence that they must've had for their journey on this biological</v>

5333
02:11:59.821 --> 02:12:00.420
<v Speaker 1>spaceship,</v>

5334
02:12:00.420 --> 02:12:03.330
<v Speaker 1>this organic spaceship hurling through the galaxy.</v>

5335
02:12:03.510 --> 02:12:05.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean it must've been far greater than ours now.</v>

5336
02:12:05.790 --> 02:12:10.560
<v Speaker 1>So like as we develop more and more technology that allows us to do more and</v>

5337
02:12:10.561 --> 02:12:14.580
<v Speaker 1>more things that make us almost superhuman in our abilities as far as like our</v>

5338
02:12:14.581 --> 02:12:15.220
<v Speaker 1>ability to,</v>

5339
02:12:15.220 --> 02:12:18.660
<v Speaker 1>to send information and receive information and get questions answered,</v>

5340
02:12:18.661 --> 02:12:19.494
<v Speaker 1>learn things,</v>

5341
02:12:19.590 --> 02:12:20.730
<v Speaker 1>transmit data,</v>

5342
02:12:20.731 --> 02:12:21.810
<v Speaker 1>photos and videos.</v>

5343
02:12:21.811 --> 02:12:23.670
<v Speaker 1>It's like unprecedented.</v>

5344
02:12:23.860 --> 02:12:27.300
<v Speaker 1>Like it's nothing has ever even been close to this before.</v>

5345
02:12:28.140 --> 02:12:29.010
<v Speaker 1>And when you see that,</v>

5346
02:12:29.011 --> 02:12:31.230
<v Speaker 1>like it really makes you wonder,</v>

5347
02:12:32.520 --> 02:12:33.690
<v Speaker 1>it really makes you wonder.</v>

5348
02:12:33.780 --> 02:12:36.840
<v Speaker 1>It really makes you wonder if like while we're doing that and then while we're</v>

5349
02:12:36.841 --> 02:12:40.020
<v Speaker 1>blocking out all this sun with all this light and you get all this light</v>

5350
02:12:40.021 --> 02:12:43.110
<v Speaker 1>pollution and then we have all this actual pollution where we don't see the</v>

5351
02:12:43.111 --> 02:12:43.944
<v Speaker 1>mountains.</v>

5352
02:12:44.130 --> 02:12:46.530
<v Speaker 1>You know that weird feeling that you get in la where you can't see the</v>

5353
02:12:46.531 --> 02:12:46.860
<v Speaker 1>mountains.</v>

5354
02:12:46.860 --> 02:12:50.780
<v Speaker 1>Then one day it rains and all of a sudden you see fucking mountains everywhere</v>

5355
02:12:50.820 --> 02:12:53.760
<v Speaker 1>coming down such that there's a snow cap mountain and you're like,</v>

5356
02:12:53.761 --> 02:12:54.720
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

5357
02:12:54.721 --> 02:12:57.180
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck put that up.</v>

5358
02:12:57.210 --> 02:13:01.980
<v Speaker 1>But it's like think about that the the areas where human beings are at their</v>

5359
02:13:01.981 --> 02:13:02.610
<v Speaker 1>biggest,</v>

5360
02:13:02.610 --> 02:13:04.730
<v Speaker 1>the areas where they're at their most overpopulated,</v>

5361
02:13:04.731 --> 02:13:08.220
<v Speaker 1>that's you also at your most disconnected from nature.</v>

5362
02:13:08.370 --> 02:13:11.670
<v Speaker 1>You're most disconnected from the view of space because of the light pollution</v>

5363
02:13:11.790 --> 02:13:15.210
<v Speaker 1>you most disconnected from the view of the mountains because of the pollution.</v>

5364
02:13:15.330 --> 02:13:20.330
<v Speaker 1>It's really fascinating cause that that sort of mindset comes out of the lack of</v>

5365
02:13:21.151 --> 02:13:22.110
<v Speaker 1>reverence for nature.</v>

5366
02:13:22.111 --> 02:13:23.910
<v Speaker 1>The Moron mindset of the city.</v>

5367
02:13:24.240 --> 02:13:25.180
<v Speaker 1>Like that's like the,</v>

5368
02:13:25.181 --> 02:13:28.590
<v Speaker 1>the lack of respect for the fact that this amazing deal with nature.</v>

5369
02:13:28.650 --> 02:13:29.520
<v Speaker 1>Crazy because it all,</v>

5370
02:13:29.521 --> 02:13:32.730
<v Speaker 1>it all happens in this big and it's easy to do.</v>

5371
02:13:32.730 --> 02:13:35.400
<v Speaker 1>Like if you live in Manhattan and you take the subway to work and you fucking</v>

5372
02:13:35.640 --> 02:13:37.920
<v Speaker 1>buy your food at this grocery store on the block and your apartments,</v>

5373
02:13:37.921 --> 02:13:38.754
<v Speaker 1>I looked up,</v>

5374
02:13:38.790 --> 02:13:39.330
<v Speaker 1>why bother?</v>

5375
02:13:39.330 --> 02:13:41.190
<v Speaker 1>What do you give a fuck if food's there you go,</v>

5376
02:13:41.191 --> 02:13:41.701
<v Speaker 1>you pay it,</v>

5377
02:13:41.701 --> 02:13:42.361
<v Speaker 1>you go to your job,</v>

5378
02:13:42.361 --> 02:13:42.901
<v Speaker 1>you get your money,</v>

5379
02:13:42.901 --> 02:13:43.734
<v Speaker 1>you pay for your groceries.</v>

5380
02:13:43.890 --> 02:13:45.800
<v Speaker 1>Why even pay attention to where it's being farmed?</v>

5381
02:13:45.810 --> 02:13:46.230
<v Speaker 1>Weight.</v>

5382
02:13:46.230 --> 02:13:48.090
<v Speaker 1>Even paying attention to pesticides,</v>

5383
02:13:48.091 --> 02:13:48.371
<v Speaker 1>agenda.</v>

5384
02:13:48.371 --> 02:13:52.140
<v Speaker 1>They can genetically modified foods or who has to go to war to control what part</v>

5385
02:13:52.141 --> 02:13:52.830
<v Speaker 1>of the world?</v>

5386
02:13:52.830 --> 02:13:53.011
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

5387
02:13:53.011 --> 02:13:53.844
<v Speaker 1>Why give a fuck?</v>

5388
02:13:53.860 --> 02:13:55.410
<v Speaker 1>That's the weird sort of an arrogance.</v>

5389
02:13:55.411 --> 02:13:57.600
<v Speaker 1>It develops and some place where you don't,</v>

5390
02:13:57.830 --> 02:13:58.041
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

5391
02:13:58.041 --> 02:13:59.430
<v Speaker 1>you're not connected to it.</v>

5392
02:13:59.431 --> 02:13:59.911
<v Speaker 1>It's like we're,</v>

5393
02:13:59.911 --> 02:14:04.410
<v Speaker 1>we're developing things in these cities where we're escaping the connection of</v>

5394
02:14:04.411 --> 02:14:06.360
<v Speaker 1>nature and like creating it ourselves.</v>

5395
02:14:06.720 --> 02:14:07.500
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5396
02:14:07.500 --> 02:14:11.520
<v Speaker 1>people that have those indoor greenhouses and shit cause something bad ass about</v>

5397
02:14:11.521 --> 02:14:11.590
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

5398
02:14:11.590 --> 02:14:13.230
<v Speaker 1>But it's something crazy like why you,</v>

5399
02:14:13.290 --> 02:14:16.990
<v Speaker 1>why you got all this food and under lamps and stuff and like in a,</v>

5400
02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:18.120
<v Speaker 1>in a basement,</v>

5401
02:14:18.300 --> 02:14:18.751
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5402
02:14:18.751 --> 02:14:19.380
<v Speaker 1>like that's,</v>

5403
02:14:19.380 --> 02:14:21.990
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend who would grow vegetables in his basement.</v>

5404
02:14:22.370 --> 02:14:22.561
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

5405
02:14:22.561 --> 02:14:23.610
<v Speaker 1>what's wrong with the dirt?</v>

5406
02:14:24.990 --> 02:14:26.160
<v Speaker 1>But you should the dirt.</v>

5407
02:14:26.161 --> 02:14:27.020
<v Speaker 1>What are you do it?</v>

5408
02:14:28.100 --> 02:14:28.251
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5409
02:14:28.251 --> 02:14:29.840
<v Speaker 1>some of it is this because they can't connect.</v>

5410
02:14:29.890 --> 02:14:30.723
<v Speaker 1>They can't</v>

5411
02:14:32.100 --> 02:14:33.290
<v Speaker 1>raise things in the winter.</v>

5412
02:14:33.350 --> 02:14:34.280
<v Speaker 1>That kind of Oh yeah,</v>

5413
02:14:34.281 --> 02:14:34.521
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

5414
02:14:34.521 --> 02:14:34.701
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

5415
02:14:34.701 --> 02:14:35.534
<v Speaker 1>Oh definitely.</v>

5416
02:14:35.890 --> 02:14:36.723
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5417
02:14:37.400 --> 02:14:39.470
<v Speaker 1>But agriculture to me and you and kill the climate.</v>

5418
02:14:40.070 --> 02:14:40.311
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5419
02:14:40.311 --> 02:14:41.270
<v Speaker 1>One day I watched those,</v>

5420
02:14:41.271 --> 02:14:41.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5421
02:14:41.600 --> 02:14:45.890
<v Speaker 1>those Alaska shows where people are like preserving all their food and getting</v>

5422
02:14:45.891 --> 02:14:46.381
<v Speaker 1>ready for the,</v>

5423
02:14:46.381 --> 02:14:49.040
<v Speaker 1>the cold to put the fucking crazy in there.</v>

5424
02:14:49.430 --> 02:14:50.390
<v Speaker 1>How did those guys,</v>

5425
02:14:50.391 --> 02:14:51.380
<v Speaker 1>the Eskimos and all,</v>

5426
02:14:51.430 --> 02:14:51.600
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>

5427
02:14:51.600 --> 02:14:52.610
<v Speaker 1>why would you ask him?</v>

5428
02:14:52.880 --> 02:14:54.260
<v Speaker 1>Why would you stop there?</v>

5429
02:14:55.010 --> 02:14:55.390
<v Speaker 1>The end,</v>

5430
02:14:55.390 --> 02:14:55.761
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>

5431
02:14:55.761 --> 02:14:57.380
<v Speaker 1>Whoever the do it,</v>

5432
02:14:57.830 --> 02:14:59.110
<v Speaker 1>what do they call it?</v>

5433
02:14:59.570 --> 02:15:00.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm not the idiot.</v>

5434
02:15:00.950 --> 02:15:01.161
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5435
02:15:01.161 --> 02:15:02.600
<v Speaker 1>where it came from was,</v>

5436
02:15:02.660 --> 02:15:03.410
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5437
02:15:03.410 --> 02:15:05.450
<v Speaker 1>the people that came down the Bering strait,</v>

5438
02:15:05.510 --> 02:15:06.590
<v Speaker 1>the same people that,</v>

5439
02:15:06.740 --> 02:15:07.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5440
02:15:07.280 --> 02:15:10.310
<v Speaker 1>that populated North America before the Europeans,</v>

5441
02:15:10.640 --> 02:15:11.473
<v Speaker 1>they walked.</v>

5442
02:15:11.570 --> 02:15:11.751
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5443
02:15:11.751 --> 02:15:12.561
<v Speaker 1>But when you start,</v>

5444
02:15:12.561 --> 02:15:14.420
<v Speaker 1>when you keep walking until you got a little warmer.</v>

5445
02:15:14.470 --> 02:15:14.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5446
02:15:14.810 --> 02:15:15.531
<v Speaker 1>I would say so.</v>

5447
02:15:15.531 --> 02:15:16.341
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

5448
02:15:16.341 --> 02:15:18.920
<v Speaker 1>they might've found like a good check that doesn't mind the cold.</v>

5449
02:15:18.921 --> 02:15:19.940
<v Speaker 1>And they started fucking,</v>

5450
02:15:19.980 --> 02:15:22.580
<v Speaker 1>they had some kids and they couldn't move to the kid got older and they said,</v>

5451
02:15:22.581 --> 02:15:22.851
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

5452
02:15:22.851 --> 02:15:23.900
<v Speaker 1>I know how to catch seal.</v>

5453
02:15:23.901 --> 02:15:24.770
<v Speaker 1>It's just stay here.</v>

5454
02:15:25.160 --> 02:15:25.401
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5455
02:15:25.401 --> 02:15:26.960
<v Speaker 1>we got to make fires every night.</v>

5456
02:15:26.961 --> 02:15:27.351
<v Speaker 1>But so why?</v>

5457
02:15:27.351 --> 02:15:29.750
<v Speaker 1>We'll make a fire rather than make it glues.</v>

5458
02:15:29.840 --> 02:15:30.673
<v Speaker 1>It's beautiful.</v>

5459
02:15:31.340 --> 02:15:31.820
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5460
02:15:31.820 --> 02:15:35.390
<v Speaker 1>there's a place in Siberia called the Thai Gow and there's this guy,</v>

5461
02:15:35.391 --> 02:15:37.940
<v Speaker 1>you mean you ever see that documentary grizzly man?</v>

5462
02:15:38.110 --> 02:15:38.880
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

5463
02:15:38.880 --> 02:15:41.640
<v Speaker 1>He ever heard of Werner Herzog documentary and he's,</v>

5464
02:15:41.690 --> 02:15:43.370
<v Speaker 1>he got a bunch of really good documentaries.</v>

5465
02:15:43.370 --> 02:15:44.750
<v Speaker 1>He's famous for his documentary.</v>

5466
02:15:44.751 --> 02:15:46.090
<v Speaker 1>That most recent one was about the,</v>

5467
02:15:46.200 --> 02:15:47.810
<v Speaker 1>you see that one about the cave paintings,</v>

5468
02:15:48.130 --> 02:15:49.670
<v Speaker 1>the cave paintings in France,</v>

5469
02:15:49.671 --> 02:15:50.700
<v Speaker 1>that really ancient,</v>

5470
02:15:50.780 --> 02:15:51.980
<v Speaker 1>incredible cave paintings.</v>

5471
02:15:52.340 --> 02:15:52.701
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>

5472
02:15:52.701 --> 02:15:53.600
<v Speaker 1>this Herzog guy,</v>

5473
02:15:53.601 --> 02:15:58.340
<v Speaker 1>he's a really good documentary and he had this thing about people that live in</v>

5474
02:15:58.341 --> 02:16:02.390
<v Speaker 1>Siberia and it was like happy people life on the taiga.</v>

5475
02:16:02.960 --> 02:16:05.870
<v Speaker 1>And it's all about these people that just fucking trap and fish.</v>

5476
02:16:06.140 --> 02:16:07.010
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

5477
02:16:07.160 --> 02:16:08.210
<v Speaker 1>there's still their culture.</v>

5478
02:16:08.300 --> 02:16:08.990
<v Speaker 1>That's all they do.</v>

5479
02:16:08.990 --> 02:16:09.561
<v Speaker 1>That's all they do.</v>

5480
02:16:09.561 --> 02:16:12.610
<v Speaker 1>And they trap and that pays for like chainsaws and shit like that.</v>

5481
02:16:12.611 --> 02:16:13.050
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>

5482
02:16:13.050 --> 02:16:13.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5483
02:16:13.310 --> 02:16:14.690
<v Speaker 1>the tools are essential tools.</v>

5484
02:16:15.110 --> 02:16:17.180
<v Speaker 1>And then from that they,</v>

5485
02:16:17.210 --> 02:16:17.720
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5486
02:16:17.720 --> 02:16:18.041
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

5487
02:16:18.041 --> 02:16:22.160
<v Speaker 1>they just fish and trap and hunt all year that is there,</v>

5488
02:16:22.161 --> 02:16:23.810
<v Speaker 1>that that's their entire existence.</v>

5489
02:16:23.811 --> 02:16:27.050
<v Speaker 1>And apparently there's like no mental problems.</v>

5490
02:16:27.150 --> 02:16:27.540
<v Speaker 1>Everybody,</v>

5491
02:16:27.540 --> 02:16:30.050
<v Speaker 1>like people are fairly healthy is skincare to them,</v>

5492
02:16:30.051 --> 02:16:32.650
<v Speaker 1>that it's life is clear and um,</v>

5493
02:16:32.651 --> 02:16:32.891
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

5494
02:16:32.891 --> 02:16:34.030
<v Speaker 1>they actually enjoy it.</v>

5495
02:16:34.180 --> 02:16:36.580
<v Speaker 1>Like they were all getting together and they were talking about how,</v>

5496
02:16:36.581 --> 02:16:37.780
<v Speaker 1>what good fun hunting,</v>

5497
02:16:37.781 --> 02:16:38.720
<v Speaker 1>what do you want to do tomorrow?</v>

5498
02:16:38.760 --> 02:16:39.700
<v Speaker 1>Let's go fishing.</v>

5499
02:16:40.280 --> 02:16:41.350
<v Speaker 1>They fished and they hunt.</v>

5500
02:16:41.500 --> 02:16:42.101
<v Speaker 1>It's a good idea.</v>

5501
02:16:42.101 --> 02:16:44.470
<v Speaker 1>And they have to store up a certain amount of meat.</v>

5502
02:16:44.620 --> 02:16:48.580
<v Speaker 1>So from that show I started getting obsessed with all these other Alaska shows</v>

5503
02:16:48.970 --> 02:16:49.511
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

5504
02:16:49.511 --> 02:16:51.220
<v Speaker 1>the show mountain men were these dude,</v>

5505
02:16:51.221 --> 02:16:53.440
<v Speaker 1>this one dude's living in North Carolina,</v>

5506
02:16:53.441 --> 02:16:56.860
<v Speaker 1>another dude's living in Montana and other dude was living in Alaska.</v>

5507
02:16:56.890 --> 02:16:57.920
<v Speaker 1>But the guy living in Alaska,</v>

5508
02:16:57.921 --> 02:17:01.900
<v Speaker 1>it's live in the craziest fucking life because this guy is a trapper and he</v>

5509
02:17:01.901 --> 02:17:06.901
<v Speaker 1>flies on a little plane hours into the wilderness hours and then lands and he</v>

5510
02:17:07.511 --> 02:17:09.010
<v Speaker 1>has the same spotty lands every year.</v>

5511
02:17:09.011 --> 02:17:12.730
<v Speaker 1>He's got this clearance that he's made and he has a trail that he's made and he</v>

5512
02:17:12.790 --> 02:17:14.170
<v Speaker 1>is a trap trail.</v>

5513
02:17:14.171 --> 02:17:17.650
<v Speaker 1>So he takes this trail with a snowmobile and leaves,</v>

5514
02:17:17.651 --> 02:17:19.120
<v Speaker 1>traps all along the way,</v>

5515
02:17:19.390 --> 02:17:22.180
<v Speaker 1>and then comes back every day or every couple days,</v>

5516
02:17:22.181 --> 02:17:22.571
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

5517
02:17:22.571 --> 02:17:25.660
<v Speaker 1>and collects the dead animals and he stays up there from months.</v>

5518
02:17:25.930 --> 02:17:29.830
<v Speaker 1>No people believe just by himself in a fucking log cabin.</v>

5519
02:17:30.190 --> 02:17:33.640
<v Speaker 1>It's Khorasan like you watching this guy's life and you go,</v>

5520
02:17:33.641 --> 02:17:34.150
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

5521
02:17:34.150 --> 02:17:36.220
<v Speaker 1>That's where your fucking coat comes from.</v>

5522
02:17:36.700 --> 02:17:40.360
<v Speaker 1>Like that is something that's a crazy lifestyle choice.</v>

5523
02:17:40.420 --> 02:17:41.640
<v Speaker 1>That's a correct whoever he'll go with,</v>

5524
02:17:41.641 --> 02:17:42.311
<v Speaker 1>stand up comedy.</v>

5525
02:17:42.311 --> 02:17:43.630
<v Speaker 1>It's gotta be the hardest thing in the world.</v>

5526
02:17:43.690 --> 02:17:45.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking liquid his life.</v>

5527
02:17:45.160 --> 02:17:46.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm obsessed with these shows,</v>

5528
02:17:46.361 --> 02:17:46.571
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

5529
02:17:46.571 --> 02:17:46.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm set.</v>

5530
02:17:46.930 --> 02:17:49.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm obsessed with the idea of subsistence living,</v>

5531
02:17:49.630 --> 02:17:50.470
<v Speaker 1>living off the land,</v>

5532
02:17:50.471 --> 02:17:51.460
<v Speaker 1>these people living off the land.</v>

5533
02:17:51.490 --> 02:17:52.323
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

5534
02:17:52.360 --> 02:17:52.961
<v Speaker 1>And Alaska.</v>

5535
02:17:52.961 --> 02:17:56.860
<v Speaker 1>The last frontier is the best one because they got really intelligent people.</v>

5536
02:17:56.861 --> 02:17:58.330
<v Speaker 1>That's a new discovery channel show.</v>

5537
02:17:58.630 --> 02:18:02.110
<v Speaker 1>They have these really smart fucking people like you're hearing them talk and</v>

5538
02:18:02.111 --> 02:18:04.870
<v Speaker 1>like these are not uneducated people there.</v>

5539
02:18:04.871 --> 02:18:09.871
<v Speaker 1>They're smart people that have lived several generations up there in Alaska.</v>

5540
02:18:10.540 --> 02:18:15.540
<v Speaker 1>They're family was a escaping a war torn Europe and so they moved to Alaska to</v>

5541
02:18:15.551 --> 02:18:16.420
<v Speaker 1>be homesteaders.</v>

5542
02:18:16.420 --> 02:18:19.870
<v Speaker 1>They got like this giant piece of land starting to growing cattle out there.</v>

5543
02:18:20.470 --> 02:18:24.190
<v Speaker 1>So crazy fucking reality that these people live.</v>

5544
02:18:24.250 --> 02:18:24.940
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>

5545
02:18:24.940 --> 02:18:26.380
<v Speaker 1>they seem pretty fucking happy man.</v>

5546
02:18:26.410 --> 02:18:27.220
<v Speaker 1>You've been up there?</v>

5547
02:18:27.220 --> 02:18:27.490
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5548
02:18:27.490 --> 02:18:28.330
<v Speaker 1>never been to Alaska.</v>

5549
02:18:28.360 --> 02:18:29.260
<v Speaker 1>It's supposed to be amazing though.</v>

5550
02:18:29.850 --> 02:18:30.710
<v Speaker 1>It's supposed to be some Ma.</v>

5551
02:18:30.970 --> 02:18:32.470
<v Speaker 1>It's real game changing shit.</v>

5552
02:18:32.500 --> 02:18:37.030
<v Speaker 1>Like when you say like the the wilderness up there that it's a state so far away</v>

5553
02:18:37.120 --> 02:18:38.950
<v Speaker 1>they say eagles are everywhere there.</v>

5554
02:18:39.610 --> 02:18:42.670
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen like any of those videos of eagles like swarming,</v>

5555
02:18:42.671 --> 02:18:44.860
<v Speaker 1>like the where the fishermen go?</v>

5556
02:18:45.280 --> 02:18:46.690
<v Speaker 1>I'd never seen a swarm of eagles.</v>

5557
02:18:47.470 --> 02:18:48.640
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>No swamp vehicles.</v>

5581
02:19:16.260 --> 02:19:16.861
<v Speaker 1>Salmon,</v>

5582
02:19:16.861 --> 02:19:17.694
<v Speaker 1>Alaska.</v>

5583
02:19:18.360 --> 02:19:18.710
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

5584
02:19:18.710 --> 02:19:19.110
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

5585
02:19:19.110 --> 02:19:19.860
<v Speaker 1>they swore,</v>

5586
02:19:19.860 --> 02:19:20.341
<v Speaker 1>I mean you,</v>

5587
02:19:20.341 --> 02:19:21.240
<v Speaker 1>you can't believe it though.</v>

5588
02:19:21.241 --> 02:19:23.550
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about like 30 or 40 bald eagles.</v>

5589
02:19:23.790 --> 02:19:25.020
<v Speaker 1>They're sitting on this lawn.</v>

5590
02:19:25.740 --> 02:19:26.610
<v Speaker 1>It's incredible.</v>

5591
02:19:27.210 --> 02:19:28.250
<v Speaker 1>It's really a,</v>

5592
02:19:28.380 --> 02:19:32.490
<v Speaker 1>one of those things that if you didn't see it on the video,</v>

5593
02:19:32.491 --> 02:19:33.570
<v Speaker 1>you would think it'd be fake.</v>

5594
02:19:33.930 --> 02:19:35.550
<v Speaker 1>But apparently people that go up there and say,</v>

5595
02:19:35.551 --> 02:19:36.780
<v Speaker 1>that's really what they're like up there.</v>

5596
02:19:36.781 --> 02:19:38.130
<v Speaker 1>There's a shitload of eagles,</v>

5597
02:19:39.270 --> 02:19:40.360
<v Speaker 6>but you still can't kill him.</v>

5598
02:19:40.600 --> 02:19:41.060

<v Speaker 1>flock.</v>

5602
02:19:46.130 --> 02:19:46.941
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that was it,</v>

02:19:46.941 --> 02:19:47.180
<v Speaker 1>Brian.</v>

5604

5610
02:19:51.550 --> 02:19:52.383
<v Speaker 6>crazy to watch.</v>

5611
02:19:52.660 --> 02:19:52.991
<v Speaker 6>Eagles.</v>

<v Speaker 6>I never saw anything like that.</v>

5660
02:20:57.740 --> 02:20:58.573
<v Speaker 6>It's crazy.</v>

<v Speaker 6>you do live in the frozen.</v>

5667
02:21:03.351 --> 02:21:04.490
<v Speaker 6>We'll new wilderness,</v>

5668
02:21:04.700 --> 02:21:06.140
<v Speaker 6>but you get to see shit like this.</v>

5669
02:21:06.141 --> 02:21:07.100
<v Speaker 6>This is a trip.</v>

5670
02:21:07.580 --> 02:21:07.761
<v Speaker 6>Now.</v>

5671
02:21:07.761 --> 02:21:09.130
<v Speaker 6>This is a protector it up in the last,</v>

02:21:09.711 --> 02:21:11.360
<v Speaker 6>they arm and they're protected everywhere,</v>

5674
02:21:11.450 --> 02:21:12.950
<v Speaker 6>but this is a part of your reality.</v>

5675
02:21:12.951 --> 02:21:13.710
<v Speaker 6>If you live up there,</v>

5676
02:21:13.710 --> 02:21:14.780
<v Speaker 6>look at this reality.</v>

5677
02:21:14.930 --> 02:21:19.190
<v Speaker 6>Your reality is you're surrounded by bald eagles and mountains,</v>

5678
02:21:20.090 --> 02:21:21.620
<v Speaker 6>and especially like right now in the summer,</v>

5679
02:21:21.621 --> 02:21:22.850
<v Speaker 6>it must be awesome.</v>

5680
02:21:23.930 --> 02:21:25.190
<v Speaker 6>The thing is like,</v>

5681
02:21:25.490 --> 02:21:26.930
<v Speaker 6>look at these kids walking up.</v>

5682
02:21:26.960 --> 02:21:27.321
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

5683
02:21:27.321 --> 02:21:29.390
<v Speaker 6>I would not let my kid go near a fucking eagle.</v>

5684
02:21:30.860 --> 02:21:32.780
<v Speaker 6>I would have a shotgun and trained on those pugs</v>

5685
02:21:35.390 --> 02:21:37.220
<v Speaker 6>because eagles have carried off babies before.</v>

5686
02:21:37.910 --> 02:21:38.061
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

5687
02:21:38.061 --> 02:21:38.451
<v Speaker 6>that's true,</v>

5688
02:21:38.451 --> 02:21:38.820
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

5689
02:21:38.820 --> 02:21:39.560
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah.</v>

5690
02:21:39.560 --> 02:21:42.650
<v Speaker 6>All these executives to just take these children and he is an old picture of an</v>

5691
02:21:42.651 --> 02:21:44.480
<v Speaker 6>eagle trying to carry off a child.</v>

5692
02:21:44.810 --> 02:21:47.810
<v Speaker 6>There's a video of a eagles killing wolves.</v>

5693
02:21:51.190 --> 02:21:52.280
<v Speaker 6>You got to see that.</v>

5694
02:21:52.430 --> 02:21:53.330
<v Speaker 6>Look at these fucking,</v>

5695
02:21:53.331 --> 02:21:56.000
<v Speaker 6>that kid has no idea how different his life is.</v>

5696
02:21:57.070 --> 02:21:57.903
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

5697
02:21:58.160 --> 02:21:58.341
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

5698
02:21:58.341 --> 02:21:59.800
<v Speaker 6>they don't have any idea how weird it is.</v>

5699
02:21:59.801 --> 02:22:01.550
<v Speaker 6>See a gang of eagles in your backyard.</v>

5700
02:22:02.360 --> 02:22:03.320
<v Speaker 6>30 Eagles.</v>

5701
02:22:04.720 --> 02:22:06.410
<v Speaker 6>I thought there were solitary animals.</v>

5702
02:22:06.411 --> 02:22:07.610
<v Speaker 6>I didn't know they flew together.</v>

5703
02:22:08.360 --> 02:22:13.340
<v Speaker 6>I think there's so much salmon in Alaska that when the salmon is running,</v>

5704
02:22:13.370 --> 02:22:17.720
<v Speaker 6>apparently they'd go bananas and they just all get together and say fuck it.</v>

5705
02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:24.350
<v Speaker 6>Ari Shaffir did stand up in Alaska and went salmon fishing and he said it's the</v>

5706
02:22:24.351 --> 02:22:25.740
<v Speaker 6>craziest thing he's ever done in his life.</v>

5707
02:22:26.160 --> 02:22:27.000
<v Speaker 6>He said it was amazing.</v>

5708
02:22:27.001 --> 02:22:28.950
<v Speaker 6>I shouldn't say it's the craziest thing he's ever done in his life,</v>

5709
02:22:28.951 --> 02:22:29.784
<v Speaker 6>cause I wouldn't be,</v>

5710
02:22:29.820 --> 02:22:30.653
<v Speaker 6>that wouldn't be true.</v>

5711
02:22:30.780 --> 02:22:34.950
<v Speaker 6>But he said it was amazing and they would eat raw salmon right from the side of</v>

5712
02:22:34.951 --> 02:22:35.401
<v Speaker 6>the boat.</v>

5713
02:22:35.401 --> 02:22:36.930
<v Speaker 6>That would just slap the salmon down,</v>

5714
02:22:37.110 --> 02:22:37.950
<v Speaker 6>cut it open,</v>

5715
02:22:38.550 --> 02:22:39.960
<v Speaker 6>take chunks out of it and just eat it.</v>

5716
02:22:39.961 --> 02:22:40.710
<v Speaker 6>That's correct.</v>

5717
02:22:40.710 --> 02:22:41.760
<v Speaker 6>He said it was delicious.</v>

5718
02:22:41.761 --> 02:22:43.980
<v Speaker 6>It sounds like the greatest Sushi could ever eat in your life.</v>

5719
02:22:44.410 --> 02:22:45.091
<v Speaker 6>You think that's gross,</v>

5720
02:22:45.091 --> 02:22:45.321
<v Speaker 6>but yeah,</v>

5721
02:22:45.321 --> 02:22:46.120
<v Speaker 6>you had Sushi.</v>

5722
02:22:46.120 --> 02:22:46.953
<v Speaker 6>I know.</v>

5723
02:22:47.080 --> 02:22:48.390
<v Speaker 6>I just don't like the faces.</v>

5724
02:22:49.220 --> 02:22:49.850
<v Speaker 6>Faces.</v>

5725
02:22:49.850 --> 02:22:50.011
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

5726
02:22:50.011 --> 02:22:50.701
<v Speaker 6>the faces.</v>

5727
02:22:50.701 --> 02:22:53.310
<v Speaker 6>You don't like the being responsible for the death.</v>

5728
02:22:53.820 --> 02:22:54.720
<v Speaker 6>Have you ever killed a fish?</v>

5729
02:22:54.980 --> 02:22:55.221
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

5730
02:22:55.221 --> 02:22:55.401
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5731
02:22:55.401 --> 02:22:56.780
<v Speaker 5>We haven't gone fishing and all that shit.</v>

5732
02:22:56.810 --> 02:22:57.980
<v Speaker 5>But you always feel bad.</v>

5733
02:22:58.010 --> 02:22:58.311
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5734
02:22:58.311 --> 02:22:59.144
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

5735
02:22:59.930 --> 02:23:00.763
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

5736
02:23:01.180 --> 02:23:02.013
<v Speaker 6>not me.</v>

5737
02:23:02.780 --> 02:23:03.613
<v Speaker 6>Not Fish.</v>

5738
02:23:03.850 --> 02:23:05.170
<v Speaker 6>I don't really feel bad about fish at all.</v>

5739
02:23:05.200 --> 02:23:05.381
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

5740
02:23:05.381 --> 02:23:06.790
<v Speaker 6>I don't want them to be tortured,</v>

5741
02:23:06.970 --> 02:23:08.320
<v Speaker 6>but I will eat the shit out of them.</v>

5742
02:23:08.400 --> 02:23:09.090
<v Speaker 6>And if I catch,</v>

5743
02:23:09.090 --> 02:23:10.570
<v Speaker 6>if you hook them button in their mouth,</v>

5744
02:23:10.571 --> 02:23:11.890
<v Speaker 6>they already starting to torture.</v>

5745
02:23:12.240 --> 02:23:12.610
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

5746
02:23:12.610 --> 02:23:14.350
<v Speaker 6>someone sounds like if Hagen,</v>

<v Speaker 6>no history person for if a fish people for ethical treatment of fish.</v>

5748
02:23:21.160 --> 02:23:23.070
<v Speaker 6>I like to think of it pit,</v>

5749

<v Speaker 6>if that's the cracks you have about people that only their pescatarians.</v>

5752
02:23:28.001 --> 02:23:30.450
<v Speaker 6>how do you know a fish doesn't have fucking bad feelings?</v>

5753
02:23:30.451 --> 02:23:31.420
<v Speaker 6>Someone said this to my wife.</v>

5754
02:23:31.421 --> 02:23:31.870
<v Speaker 6>She said,</v>

5756

5758
02:23:33.010 --> 02:23:34.210
<v Speaker 6>fish don't raise their babies.</v>

5759
02:23:35.410 --> 02:23:35.711
<v Speaker 6>I went,</v>

5760
02:23:35.711 --> 02:23:36.500
<v Speaker 6>whoa.</v>

5761
02:23:36.500 --> 02:23:37.140
<v Speaker 6>She was truly,</v>

5762
02:23:37.140 --> 02:23:37.973
<v Speaker 6>even dolphins.</v>

5763
02:23:38.320 --> 02:23:39.340
<v Speaker 6>Dolphins aren't fish.</v>

5764
02:23:39.370 --> 02:23:39.791
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah,</v>

5765
02:23:39.791 --> 02:23:40.624
<v Speaker 6>they're mammals.</v>

5766
02:23:41.170 --> 02:23:42.200
<v Speaker 6>But she said no.</v>

5767
02:23:42.400 --> 02:23:44.490
<v Speaker 6>There's dolphins that are fish to whites.</v>

5768
02:23:44.590 --> 02:23:45.423
<v Speaker 6>There's dolphins,</v>

5769
02:23:47.320 --> 02:23:47.711
<v Speaker 6>Mahi,</v>

5770
02:23:47.711 --> 02:23:48.041
<v Speaker 6>Mahi.</v>

5771
02:23:48.041 --> 02:23:49.480
<v Speaker 6>Actually they call them dolphin fish.</v>

5772
02:23:49.510 --> 02:23:49.691
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

5773
02:23:49.691 --> 02:23:50.471
<v Speaker 6>I know what you're talking about.</v>

5774
02:23:50.471 --> 02:23:50.890
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

5775
02:23:50.890 --> 02:23:51.271
<v Speaker 6>that's fine.</v>

5776
02:23:51.271 --> 02:23:54.550
<v Speaker 6>Because I read that in a magazine once when I was just starting to fish and I</v>

5777
02:23:54.551 --> 02:23:54.851
<v Speaker 6>was like,</v>

5778
02:23:54.851 --> 02:23:56.350
<v Speaker 6>why people fish for dolphins?</v>

5779
02:23:56.351 --> 02:23:57.200
<v Speaker 6>That's crazy.</v>

5780
02:23:57.240 --> 02:23:58.090
<v Speaker 6>It's not the same dog.</v>

5781
02:23:58.091 --> 02:23:58.820
<v Speaker 6>It's not the,</v>

5782
02:23:58.820 --> 02:24:01.660
<v Speaker 6>it's actually a fish that the flipper type don't know.</v>

5783
02:24:01.780 --> 02:24:02.141
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

5784
02:24:02.141 --> 02:24:05.290
<v Speaker 6>It's not really called a dolphin very often.</v>

5785
02:24:05.530 --> 02:24:06.790
<v Speaker 6>It's mostly called Mahima.</v>

5786
02:24:06.990 --> 02:24:07.240
