1
00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.530
<v Speaker 1>Hey Joe Rogan podcast by night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all day he was sitting there was still</v>

2
00:00:05.581 --> 00:00:09.780
<v Speaker 1>that kind of prestigious like app after</v>
<v Speaker 1>he lost that and it's like,</v>

3
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:10.510
<v Speaker 1>oh fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4
00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:11.343
<v Speaker 1>we can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Coach</v>

5
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.590
<v Speaker 1>coaches were saying that his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his own mma coach,</v>

6
00:00:16.591 --> 00:00:20.430
<v Speaker 1>after he knocked out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brett Rogers said that fate or one with</v>

7
00:00:20.431 --> 00:00:23.370
<v Speaker 1>his old tricks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he would have liked to have him for</v>

8
00:00:23.371 --> 00:00:26.040
<v Speaker 1>more time training and he thinks he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

9
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.280
<v Speaker 1>he's not approaching it correctly and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>just won by being fader.</v>

10
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.680
<v Speaker 1>But he also caught,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

11
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for doom with that old trick.</v>

12
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.190
<v Speaker 1>He caught him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knocked him down,</v>

13
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.490
<v Speaker 1>and then the mistake of federal members,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he jumped into his guard,</v>

14
00:00:38.491 --> 00:00:41.640
<v Speaker 1>but remember he jumped into pound,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he caught him really,</v>

15
00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:44.220
<v Speaker 1>really well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Knocked him down with the exact same</v>

16
00:00:44.221 --> 00:00:47.250
<v Speaker 1>time that he did to everybody before</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

17
00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.570
<v Speaker 1>So maybe maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe Verdugo goes down on purpose</v>

18
00:00:52.711 --> 00:00:55.560
<v Speaker 1>the moment a punch him so he could drag</v>
<v Speaker 1>you into,</v>

19
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.233
<v Speaker 1>which he does.</v>

20
00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.990
<v Speaker 1>He's a smart guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're doing is a very smart guy.</v>

21
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.860
<v Speaker 1>Fight fights than Saturday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Definitely did not face first because he</v>

22
00:01:04.861 --> 00:01:07.290
<v Speaker 1>got tagged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you watch the stoppage,</v>

23
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.820
<v Speaker 1>if you see if you can find the</v>
<v Speaker 1>highlight,</v>

24
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.640
<v Speaker 1>I'll show it to you because this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that I wish somebody brought</v>

25
00:01:11.641 --> 00:01:16.641
<v Speaker 1>up during the actual commentary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got tagged right before he got</v>

26
00:01:16.831 --> 00:01:19.240
<v Speaker 1>knocked out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got tagged doing the same thing with</v>

27
00:01:19.241 --> 00:01:20.850
<v Speaker 1>the right hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He moved forward.</v>

28
00:01:20.851 --> 00:01:22.410
<v Speaker 1>He was making these advances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He moved forward.</v>

29
00:01:22.411 --> 00:01:26.100
<v Speaker 1>He got tagged with that right hand and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think he was on Queer Street and I think</v>

30
00:01:26.101 --> 00:01:30.540
<v Speaker 1>he went running at steep a on queer</v>
<v Speaker 1>street and got knocked the fuck out and</v>

31
00:01:30.541 --> 00:01:34.140
<v Speaker 1>the way they did it was a fucking work</v>
<v Speaker 1>of art.</v>

32
00:01:34.141 --> 00:01:36.360
<v Speaker 1>The angle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like Anderson Silva and forest</v>

33
00:01:36.361 --> 00:01:41.361
<v Speaker 1>baby step to the right and even better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His angle was sick and obviously his</v>

34
00:01:42.031 --> 00:01:43.020
<v Speaker 1>right hand was nasty.</v>

35
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.600
<v Speaker 1>It's also volume did get hit early and</v>
<v Speaker 1>in boardrooms training.</v>

36
00:01:49.831 --> 00:01:53.850
<v Speaker 1>If you've seen him train it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this competition within that.</v>

37
00:01:53.851 --> 00:01:55.030
<v Speaker 1>Jim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you get hit it's like,</v>

38
00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:56.400
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got to get them back.</v>

39
00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.660
<v Speaker 1>I think it was more gets hit and he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

40
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:00.900
<v Speaker 1>go charging bull.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And was like,</v>

41
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.630
<v Speaker 1>fuck this man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's probably a little of both.</v>

42
00:02:03.631 --> 00:02:07.890
<v Speaker 1>I agree because I definitely think both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got crack crack and I'm like,</v>

43
00:02:07.891 --> 00:02:10.830
<v Speaker 1>well that is a big right hand that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>got hit with and it's in the same</v>

44
00:02:10.831 --> 00:02:12.360
<v Speaker 1>manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same managed charging.</v>

45
00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.880
<v Speaker 1>40 got hit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how although got knocked out</v>

46
00:02:14.881 --> 00:02:15.714
<v Speaker 1>against Mcgregor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

47
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.170
<v Speaker 1>You got to be fucking real careful</v>
<v Speaker 1>charging for</v>

48
00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.140
<v Speaker 1>harder because.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

49
00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.160
<v Speaker 1>Steve Bay's not got some great guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's not a knockout artist per se.</v>

50
00:02:26.161 --> 00:02:28.080
<v Speaker 1>If you compare them to like a mark</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nelson,</v>

51
00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.800
<v Speaker 1>he's not knockout artist when the guy's</v>
<v Speaker 1>charging in like that and then you're</v>

52
00:02:31.801 --> 00:02:33.990
<v Speaker 1>counting with right hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes it seem way.</v>

53
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.600
<v Speaker 1>Well here's my take on steep based</v>
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>

54
00:02:36.601 --> 00:02:40.070
<v Speaker 1>I think Steve Bay has big power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think he fights economically and</v>

55
00:02:40.071 --> 00:02:42.060
<v Speaker 1>intelligently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a smooth fighter,</v>

56
00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.050
<v Speaker 1>a boxer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a very good boxer,</v>

57
00:02:44.051 --> 00:02:48.030
<v Speaker 1>a golden gloves boxer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's smooth and relaxed in the way</v>

58
00:02:48.031 --> 00:02:49.740
<v Speaker 1>he spars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the things that makes them</v>

59
00:02:49.741 --> 00:02:52.920
<v Speaker 1>so dangerous because as he does things</v>
<v Speaker 1>very correctly,</v>

60
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think,</v>

61
00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>DC was on the commentary for the UFC</v>

62
00:02:57.601 --> 00:02:59.440
<v Speaker 1>recently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was talking about getting the rub,</v>

63
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was talking about that experience.</v>

64
00:03:01.541 --> 00:03:03.610
<v Speaker 1>When you have a tough fight with</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone,</v>

65
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.040
<v Speaker 1>you get the rub and he fought junior dos</v>
<v Speaker 1>Santos and they went to war.</v>

66
00:03:07.041 --> 00:03:08.980
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean rubbed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what I mean,</v>

67
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.690
<v Speaker 1>what he was saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

68
00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:12.460
<v Speaker 1>Daniel says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you fight someone that's really</v>

69
00:03:12.461 --> 00:03:15.550
<v Speaker 1>good and they're better than you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you lose you,</v>

70
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:16.600
<v Speaker 1>it elevates you.</v>

71
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.530
<v Speaker 1>You get the rub like just by sharing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ring with them just by being in that re,</v>

72
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.320
<v Speaker 1>by competing with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you realize how good you are when you</v>

73
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.920
<v Speaker 1>actually get better and you realize how</v>
<v Speaker 1>good that person is.</v>

74
00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he got the rub when he fought</v>

75
00:03:28.211 --> 00:03:31.930
<v Speaker 1>junior dos Santos in a way because he</v>
<v Speaker 1>went five rounds with a guy who was the</v>

76
00:03:31.931 --> 00:03:34.120
<v Speaker 1>one of the toughest of the tough guy was</v>
<v Speaker 1>at Warren,</v>

77
00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.780
<v Speaker 1>a champion or knocked out Cain Velasquez</v>
<v Speaker 1>was one punch and he went five hard</v>

78
00:03:37.781 --> 00:03:41.440
<v Speaker 1>rounds with them and the decision will</v>
<v Speaker 1>could have went either way and took his</v>

79
00:03:41.441 --> 00:03:44.440
<v Speaker 1>best shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I also think that to go back to</v>

80
00:03:44.441 --> 00:03:46.270
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] point and your point with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rub,</v>

81
00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.650
<v Speaker 1>I think at the UTC level of special</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't get in that top echelon.</v>

82
00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:51.610
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're getting,</v>

83
00:03:51.611 --> 00:03:55.810
<v Speaker 1>people are telling you you're good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like when he beat Orlowski starched</v>

84
00:03:55.811 --> 00:03:55.960
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

85
00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.760
<v Speaker 1>You don't learn much from that man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he go up to a decision with a world</v>

86
00:03:59.761 --> 00:04:01.780
<v Speaker 1>class guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you know,</v>

87
00:04:01.781 --> 00:04:03.670
<v Speaker 1>like you're doing something right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your camp,</v>

88
00:04:03.671 --> 00:04:05.500
<v Speaker 1>you're doing it right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had good gas,</v>

89
00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.510
<v Speaker 1>you realize what works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does it.</v>

90
00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.790
<v Speaker 1>So you learn so much more and he's going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

91
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.520
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more with jds and we see them getting</v>

92
00:04:12.521 --> 00:04:17.170
<v Speaker 1>better and better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's really interesting now is here's</v>

93
00:04:17.171 --> 00:04:21.130
<v Speaker 1>the dark horse that nobody talks about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stephan Struve is only 28 years old.</v>

94
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.330
<v Speaker 1>That fucking dude is gigantic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's seven feet tall.</v>

95
00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.240
<v Speaker 1>And if he could put it together and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>put it together on big foot silver the</v>

96
00:04:28.241 --> 00:04:29.260
<v Speaker 1>other night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knocked him out.</v>

97
00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.570
<v Speaker 1>I love the guy has a bunch of knockout</v>
<v Speaker 1>losses.</v>

98
00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.880
<v Speaker 1>I know he does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he knocked out steepbank.</v>

99
00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.170
<v Speaker 1>Struve got steeper</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the UFC.</v>

100
00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

101
00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:40.890
<v Speaker 1>Dude Struve do not count that guy out</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>

102
00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.740
<v Speaker 1>Struve did an inside leg kick and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got that heart issue and stuff.</v>

103
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.480
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what he's got going on</v>

104
00:04:46.481 --> 00:04:48.610
<v Speaker 1>physically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm saying that kid,</v>

105
00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.970
<v Speaker 1>if he puts it all together when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven feet tall,</v>

106
00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:55.750
<v Speaker 1>how long does it take before you even</v>
<v Speaker 1>get coordinated?</v>

107
00:04:55.751 --> 00:04:58.090
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like you're sending a</v>

108
00:04:58.091 --> 00:05:02.290
<v Speaker 1>message and it's got to go so far before</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gets to your fucking hand.</v>

109
00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you ever thought you fought guys</v>

110
00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.790
<v Speaker 1>are super tall like Jack Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those guys.</v>

111
00:05:06.791 --> 00:05:11.791
<v Speaker 1>I mean it like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing is is steep aid would be,</v>

112
00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.130
<v Speaker 1>or not Steve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a strew would be such a fricking handful</v>

113
00:05:15.131 --> 00:05:19.090
<v Speaker 1>of could learn to use his reach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you guys like Roy Nelson.</v>

114
00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.750
<v Speaker 1>When you get these upper echelon guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

115
00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.080
<v Speaker 1>nothing gets bigfoot but off trt or</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the case,</v>

116
00:05:25.081 --> 00:05:26.250
<v Speaker 1>he actually needs it off it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't know what he's got.</v>

130
00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:55.480
<v Speaker 1>What is the medical condition?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget.</v>

131
00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.830
<v Speaker 1>We have the same manager,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he deals with it all the time.</v>

132
00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.080
<v Speaker 1>That Mark Hunt knockouts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ Marco,</v>

133
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.330
<v Speaker 1>would that leaching left hook shattered</v>

<v Speaker 1>So fucking you've been caged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sad scene that.</v>

136
00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:08.240
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fast.</v>

137
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:12.560
<v Speaker 1>Too</v>
<v Speaker 1>steep a can get.</v>

138
00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:17.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm curious to see if they can get but</v>
<v Speaker 1>within boxing distance of allister and</v>

139
00:06:17.541 --> 00:06:19.400
<v Speaker 1>take away any of those kicks and how he</v>
<v Speaker 1>sets it up.</v>

140
00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:22.010
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alster combox man.</v>

141
00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.000
<v Speaker 1>He can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

142
00:06:23.001 --> 00:06:26.060
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Better than to tell you knocked out</v>

143
00:06:26.061 --> 00:06:28.310
<v Speaker 1>junior with one punch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>

144
00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:33.410
<v Speaker 1>He's the best striker in the UFC</v>
<v Speaker 1>heavyweight division maybe of all time.</v>

145
00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:33.770
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

146
00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:34.840
<v Speaker 1>So Steve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steve Bay,</v>

147
00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:37.180
<v Speaker 1>then it's going to have to close that</v>
<v Speaker 1>distance and knocks him.</v>

148
00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:39.530
<v Speaker 1>Not necessarily note Steve Bay could</v>
<v Speaker 1>crack him.</v>

149
00:06:39.531 --> 00:06:40.880
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ben Rothwell knocked him out in the</v>

150
00:06:40.881 --> 00:06:42.450
<v Speaker 1>first round cup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has better fulfilled,</v>

151
00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:45.920
<v Speaker 1>can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Footwork and house has been stopped a</v>

152
00:06:45.921 --> 00:06:47.870
<v Speaker 1>lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chins the question.</v>

153
00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:49.910
<v Speaker 1>This is the other thing people forget</v>
<v Speaker 1>with allister.</v>

154
00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.140
<v Speaker 1>Then we'll fucking grapple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

155
00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:53.930
<v Speaker 1>In wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Grappling his ass off.</v>

156
00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:55.130
<v Speaker 1>So you want to go to the ground with</v>
<v Speaker 1>them?</v>

157
00:06:55.131 --> 00:06:56.150
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna be in a world of trouble.</v>

158
00:06:56.150 --> 00:07:00.440
<v Speaker 1>Well he won the Abu Dhabi European</v>
<v Speaker 1>trials and in pride he submitted tour.</v>

159
00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:02.270
<v Speaker 1>He's got an.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He also submitted Mark Hunt.</v>

160
00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.090
<v Speaker 1>He has a nasty guillotine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

161
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:07.910
<v Speaker 1>His team always forgetting about</v>
<v Speaker 1>birthing of just as a striker,</v>

162
00:07:07.911 --> 00:07:10.580
<v Speaker 1>but you want to go to the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think Steve Bay has a lot of</v>

163
00:07:10.581 --> 00:07:14.240
<v Speaker 1>submission.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Work under is so steep and I trained for</v>

164
00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:17.300
<v Speaker 1>two years together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That kid has submission defense.</v>

165
00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:18.950
<v Speaker 1>So you're not were shot as his black</v>
<v Speaker 1>belt.</v>

166
00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:22.850
<v Speaker 1>If you asked Rashad to show you like</v>
<v Speaker 1>Omoplata a real specific,</v>

167
00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:24.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>offensive move.</v>

168
00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:27.530
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think at that black belt level,</v>

169
00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:32.750
<v Speaker 1>but his defense and that's steep based</v>
<v Speaker 1>defense is nes super nasty.</v>

170
00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.250
<v Speaker 1>It's just what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's really good at.</v>

171
00:07:34.251 --> 00:07:36.500
<v Speaker 1>Defense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a very smart athlete,</v>

172
00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:40.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's when you have a guy who's a who</v>

173
00:07:40.611 --> 00:07:43.130
<v Speaker 1>could probably be a professional ball</v>
<v Speaker 1>player,</v>

174
00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:44.250
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Will Bay.</v>

175
00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:46.010
<v Speaker 1>He could probably be a professional</v>
<v Speaker 1>ball.</v>

176
00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.130
<v Speaker 1>He didn't make it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

177
00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:49.280
<v Speaker 1>he didn't make it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's at this level of an,</v>

178
00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:50.780
<v Speaker 1>of an athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

179
00:07:50.781 --> 00:07:54.620
<v Speaker 1>What I'm saying is it's rare that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>see a guy like that who comes over to</v>

180
00:07:54.621 --> 00:07:57.920
<v Speaker 1>mma and fights like super technical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super smart,</v>

181
00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:02.490
<v Speaker 1>who's also really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really tough firefighter for</v>

182
00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:04.420
<v Speaker 1>professional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>full time head.</v>

183
00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:07.090
<v Speaker 1>His head is the biggest head I've ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever seen into large set.</v>

184
00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:08.960
<v Speaker 1>Nicest guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a great guy,</v>

185
00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:12.260
<v Speaker 1>but he's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got a rare set of attributes,</v>

186
00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:15.470
<v Speaker 1>meaning that he's at pro sports athlete</v>
<v Speaker 1>level,</v>

187
00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:18.320
<v Speaker 1>like as far as like like his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his ability,</v>

188
00:08:18.321 --> 00:08:22.010
<v Speaker 1>his movement and his intelligence in his</v>
<v Speaker 1>approach and his training and then on</v>

189
00:08:22.011 --> 00:08:27.011
<v Speaker 1>top of that he's tough as fuck stuff is</v>
<v Speaker 1>tough as fuck.</v>

190
00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:29.180
<v Speaker 1>Like in this fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me tell you something,</v>

191
00:08:29.181 --> 00:08:31.850
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched this fight very careful and</v>

192
00:08:31.851 --> 00:08:36.350
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that I was noticing</v>
<v Speaker 1>was how calm he was through everything</v>

193
00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:37.340
<v Speaker 1>through the walk.</v>

194
00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:38.930
<v Speaker 1>When they watch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're staring each other down.</v>

195
00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:42.680
<v Speaker 1>One of the things you really pay</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention to is the shortness of the</v>

196
00:08:42.681 --> 00:08:46.340
<v Speaker 1>breathing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you watch people breathing during,</v>

197
00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:49.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm like nervous situations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times even if they look calm,</v>

198
00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:54.380
<v Speaker 1>you could sort of see this uneasiness in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way they're taking in oxygen.</v>

199
00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:56.400
<v Speaker 1>You're sensing tension,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not seeing.</v>

200
00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:58.080
<v Speaker 1>You don't sense any of that shit looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>at,</v>

201
00:08:58.081 --> 00:09:01.380
<v Speaker 1>you know what's impressive to if he</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't come from like a mastermind</v>

202
00:09:01.381 --> 00:09:02.214
<v Speaker 1>camp?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

203
00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:04.050
<v Speaker 1>it's just his boys and Cleveland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

204
00:09:04.051 --> 00:09:07.290
<v Speaker 1>he just might have a mastermind can be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of masterminds out there</v>

205
00:09:07.291 --> 00:09:09.590
<v Speaker 1>that don't have the right pupils.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying he's not from like a</v>

206
00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:14.490
<v Speaker 1>Jackson's Aka the att.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He kicks his shit within Cleveland and</v>

207
00:09:14.491 --> 00:09:18.180
<v Speaker 1>does work and then goes and saves people</v>
<v Speaker 1>from burning buildings.</v>

208
00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:21.540
<v Speaker 1>Who else is in that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That camp is the guard style.</v>

209
00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:22.770
<v Speaker 1>MMA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's also the.</v>

210
00:09:22.771 --> 00:09:25.410
<v Speaker 1>Isn't there a Leslie Smith from there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

211
00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:26.700
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Raquel Pennington,</v>

212
00:09:26.701 --> 00:09:29.570
<v Speaker 1>Right Jessica?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Jessica.</v>

213
00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:32.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have tough fighters.</v>

214
00:09:32.611 --> 00:09:36.780
<v Speaker 1>It's just like if a guy's like a really</v>
<v Speaker 1>skillful trainer and you know you've</v>

215
00:09:36.781 --> 00:09:39.570
<v Speaker 1>only been doing it for a few years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to wait for the right guy to</v>

216
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:44.600
<v Speaker 1>sort of walk through your door.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then walking through the door with Eddie</v>

217
00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:48.780

<v Speaker 1>Took forever for him to find someone who</v>

218
00:09:48.781 --> 00:09:53.781
<v Speaker 1>could do his style and prove in</v>
<v Speaker 1>competition that it's very effective.</v>

219
00:09:53.911 --> 00:09:56.740
<v Speaker 1>Not just with him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had a unique style phase.</v>

220
00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:59.310
<v Speaker 1>Brother or dad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy with the mustache.</v>

221

<v Speaker 1>Remember he's fighting right now.</v>

224
00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:06.180

<v Speaker 1>Brian.</v>

225
00:10:06.181 --> 00:10:09.390
<v Speaker 1>Why are you calling that guy his dad?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because his older brother,</v>

226

228
00:10:16.891 --> 00:10:18.340
<v Speaker 1>point about this.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He was making that face that he may say,</v>

232
00:10:23.881 --> 00:10:25.500
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so sick of that face.</v>

233
00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:26.940
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's being funny.</v>

234
00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:29.400
<v Speaker 1>It's being silly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's anything wrong</v>

235
00:10:29.401 --> 00:10:32.040
<v Speaker 1>with a fighter trying to stay loose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't at all.</v>

236
00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:33.750
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's one of the things that</v>

237
00:10:33.751 --> 00:10:36.580
<v Speaker 1>fabrizio does to have a good time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He likes to make that silly.</v>

238
00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:40.720
<v Speaker 1>He's been doing it forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the man he's bullied for ever do</v>

239
00:10:40.721 --> 00:10:42.240
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you won the fight and made that face,</v>

240
00:10:42.241 --> 00:10:45.570
<v Speaker 1>no one say a fucking word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you went out there and head kicked,</v>

241
00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:47.870
<v Speaker 1>steep meo chick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

242
00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:50.610
<v Speaker 1>no one would say a word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it didn't work out.</v>

243
00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:53.610
<v Speaker 1>So when it doesn't work out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when everybody comes shitting on</v>

244
00:10:53.611 --> 00:10:54.444
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same.</v>

245
00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.520
<v Speaker 1>What's the same with connor?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Connor?</v>

246
00:10:56.850 --> 00:11:00.240
<v Speaker 1>Connor was walking out like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

247
00:11:00.241 --> 00:11:03.360
<v Speaker 1>same with Rhonda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When Ronda lost everybody's mad at all</v>

248
00:11:03.361 --> 00:11:06.600
<v Speaker 1>the shit that they loved her for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they love to for don't be a do nothing,</v>

249
00:11:06.601 --> 00:11:09.180
<v Speaker 1>bitch and fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm making it to the top.</v>

250
00:11:09.181 --> 00:11:10.510

<v Speaker 1>Or they hate it.</v>

251
00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:12.680
<v Speaker 1>They now we think she's arrogant to</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

252
00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:13.700
<v Speaker 1>Same with Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If</v>

253
00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:18.720
<v Speaker 1>he's in Venice right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>driving around a royals Royce just</v>

254
00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:20.740
<v Speaker 1>wiling out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

255
00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.710
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

256
00:11:22.711 --> 00:11:26.250
<v Speaker 1>it's just what comes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's part of what people love about</v>

257
00:11:26.251 --> 00:11:28.200
<v Speaker 1>people bragging or they want to bring</v>
<v Speaker 1>you down though,</v>

258
00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:31.200
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look how loose deep it looks because</v>

259
00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:33.720
<v Speaker 1>loose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's fighting for the title nice</v>

260
00:11:33.721 --> 00:11:35.370
<v Speaker 1>and loose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he moves away.</v>

261
00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:37.860
<v Speaker 1>Keeping argued.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He should've got title earlier too,</v>

262
00:11:37.861 --> 00:11:41.520
<v Speaker 1>but he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's just such a nice guy and a lot of</v>

263
00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:42.310
<v Speaker 1>checking to.</v>

264
00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:44.870
<v Speaker 1>Lot of good checking of kicks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a kid's ties.</v>

265
00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:48.690
<v Speaker 1>Very good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very educated with his movements and</v>

266
00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:51.840
<v Speaker 1>look for breezy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's got some fucking nasty kicks man?</v>

267
00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:55.090
<v Speaker 1>And he's like right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His striking is much improved.</v>

268
00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:56.890
<v Speaker 1>We saw it in the Travis Brown fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

269
00:11:57.910 --> 00:11:59.160
<v Speaker 1>Dangerous on the feet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

270
00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:03.130
<v Speaker 1>Alaska is dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His striking is fucking legit.</v>

271
00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:06.730
<v Speaker 1>He's long shit and he's got confidence</v>
<v Speaker 1>in it.</v>

272
00:12:06.731 --> 00:12:08.550
<v Speaker 1>That nice switch kick there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

273
00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:11.140
<v Speaker 1>but he's a beast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in order to be that dangerous of</v>

274
00:12:11.141 --> 00:12:13.090
<v Speaker 1>a fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have to open yourself up</v>

275
00:12:13.091 --> 00:12:15.550
<v Speaker 1>a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then when you fight a real strategic guy</v>

276
00:12:15.551 --> 00:12:17.530
<v Speaker 1>like steep a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're to get a little bit of trouble.</v>

277
00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:19.630
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what happened in this fight in</v>

278
00:12:19.631 --> 00:12:22.270
<v Speaker 1>particular is that he forced it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

279
00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:25.030
<v Speaker 1>thank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was in this gigantic soccer arena.</v>

280
00:12:25.031 --> 00:12:28.420
<v Speaker 1>It's the biggest crowd in history and</v>
<v Speaker 1>mma in Brazil.</v>

281
00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:30.550
<v Speaker 1>Look at that beautiful leg kick though</v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

282
00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:33.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the inside 90 Chad that to.</v>

283
00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:35.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all nice.</v>

284
00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:38.680
<v Speaker 1>Like the technique is real nice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think for Breesa was just so</v>

285
00:12:38.681 --> 00:12:42.250
<v Speaker 1>ramped up because there's all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in Brazil and I think he's a</v>

286
00:12:42.251 --> 00:12:44.650
<v Speaker 1>confident man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he thinks he's the fucking best</v>

287
00:12:44.651 --> 00:12:46.750
<v Speaker 1>in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just has to get ahold of this dude.</v>

288
00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:49.070
<v Speaker 1>There's a right hand and nailed the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

289
00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:51.280
<v Speaker 1>so now we can take a shot tab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now.</v>

290
00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:52.780
<v Speaker 1>But now look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's forcing it.</v>

291
00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:54.790
<v Speaker 1>Forcing it because he landed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

292
00:12:54.791 --> 00:12:56.590
<v Speaker 1>So Watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he starts to force it,</v>

293
00:12:56.740 --> 00:13:00.580
<v Speaker 1>he gets hit real hard and then he gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>hit hard and knocked out.</v>

294
00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:05.540
<v Speaker 1>He tried that knee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tries forward and when sees he got a</v>

295
00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:07.780
<v Speaker 1>terrible single attempt there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was like such a.</v>

296
00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:09.860
<v Speaker 1>you're like getting steeper on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was also,</v>

297
00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:12.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean he might've been just trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make them work,</v>

298
00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:14.320
<v Speaker 1>but look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe open up possibilities.</v>

299
00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:18.380
<v Speaker 1>I think you dropped for a single mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

300
00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:20.470
<v Speaker 1>And so he's not afraid to just be</v>
<v Speaker 1>writing their girls.</v>

301
00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:24.490
<v Speaker 1>Not though be he's not reading range,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's real relaxed.</v>

302
00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:26.220
<v Speaker 1>Even the waste throwing that chap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that top,</v>

303
00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:28.720
<v Speaker 1>top,</v>
<v Speaker 1>top now like he's economical and when</v>

304
00:13:28.721 --> 00:13:31.230

<v Speaker 1>super chat.</v>

305

<v Speaker 1>He's timing that jasmine great inside</v>

306
00:13:35.831 --> 00:13:39.220
<v Speaker 1>leg kick in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Jab also is super light.</v>

307
00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:43.340
<v Speaker 1>Like he's just floating it out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pop his nice lots of steps.</v>

308
00:13:43.341 --> 00:13:45.760
<v Speaker 1>20 Jepson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We stepped to the side there like that.</v>

309
00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:48.540
<v Speaker 1>Like look at that jacket on sale like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is to talk,</v>

310
00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:50.890
<v Speaker 1>you know he's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no tension there.</v>

311
00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:54.010
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's like flowing a check that link</v>

312
00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:55.150
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nice leg kick by.</v>

313
00:13:55.151 --> 00:13:56.590
<v Speaker 1>Steep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A nice switch.</v>

314
00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:01.760
<v Speaker 1>So right now for Mesa was realizing</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

315
00:14:01.761 --> 00:14:04.750
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is an easy part.</v>

316
00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:07.370
<v Speaker 1>That's the one you're reading right</v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

317
00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:08.500
<v Speaker 1>Bang.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the chaos.</v>

318
00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:12.140
<v Speaker 1>Now back it up again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch just just back it up just a little</v>

319
00:14:12.141 --> 00:14:14.950
<v Speaker 1>bit to where it's chasing them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So watching these channels,</v>

320
00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:16.920
<v Speaker 1>he got rocky NBA players.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

321
00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:20.450
<v Speaker 1>You're correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

322
00:14:20.451 --> 00:14:21.800
<v Speaker 1>I saw the correct though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>

323
00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:24.140
<v Speaker 1>I didn't see that until.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he got mad and he came out.</v>

324
00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:24.980
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

325
00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:25.990
<v Speaker 1>He got his tag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

326
00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:28.400
<v Speaker 1>He got tagged hard with that right hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

327
00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:31.640
<v Speaker 1>And then he kept charging and then he</v>
<v Speaker 1>got face planted with the second one</v>

328
00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:34.010
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that first right hand had him on Queer</v>

329
00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:35.600
<v Speaker 1>Street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee you because he's moving</v>

330
00:14:35.601 --> 00:14:39.110
<v Speaker 1>forward and steep a drops it in on them</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's the same punch he knocked him</v>

331
00:14:39.111 --> 00:14:42.440
<v Speaker 1>out with and it's when when Steve Bay</v>
<v Speaker 1>throws a punch and this is how,</v>

332
00:14:42.441 --> 00:14:45.590
<v Speaker 1>you know he's good at me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously fucking good,</v>

333
00:14:45.591 --> 00:14:47.050
<v Speaker 1>but this is how you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

334
00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:48.710
<v Speaker 1>techniques at a real high level.</v>

335
00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:53.890
<v Speaker 1>His arm is like loose and then he throws</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and then as it gets to his face he</v>

336
00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:59.150
<v Speaker 1>tightens it down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does this stack like as he's moving</v>

337
00:14:59.151 --> 00:15:00.480
<v Speaker 1>away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

338
00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:05.490
<v Speaker 1>it's a super efficient,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like really technical punch to the</v>

339
00:15:05.961 --> 00:15:08.270
<v Speaker 1>throat that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Moving back back.</v>

340
00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:10.770
<v Speaker 1>In that sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very much like what Anderson did.</v>

341
00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:12.890
<v Speaker 1>Forrest Griffin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also calculated because you threw</v>

342
00:15:12.891 --> 00:15:15.050
<v Speaker 1>it twice and they both land and there</v>
<v Speaker 1>built.</v>

343
00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:17.300
<v Speaker 1>You can tell they're working on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he threw.</v>

344
00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:18.050
<v Speaker 1>He threw the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

345
00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:21.400
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the left hook twice to check,</v>

346
00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:21.711
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

347
00:15:21.711 --> 00:15:24.120
<v Speaker 1>Moving back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>moving back and something as he stepped</v>

348
00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:28.370
<v Speaker 1>into the side when he does that or you</v>
<v Speaker 1>had to guess it doesn't even necessarily</v>

349
00:15:28.371 --> 00:15:31.160
<v Speaker 1>have to be that he planned it out and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a part of the game plan.</v>

350
00:15:31.161 --> 00:15:33.950
<v Speaker 1>I think Steve Bay does that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's a really good striker.</v>

351
00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:35.190
<v Speaker 1>If you look at his movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

352
00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:39.740
<v Speaker 1>and I think you're looking at a guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's super fucking determined,</v>

353
00:15:39.741 --> 00:15:42.530
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steve Bay is super determined and when</v>

354
00:15:42.531 --> 00:15:46.280
<v Speaker 1>you're a guy that's that focused,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get fucking really good</v>

355
00:15:46.281 --> 00:15:48.370
<v Speaker 1>at everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So after he gets that fight,</v>

356
00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:49.790
<v Speaker 1>that Jab,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jab,</v>

357
00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:52.540
<v Speaker 1>it's like an upper customer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is too.</v>

358
00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:56.300
<v Speaker 1>It's so everything he's doing is so</v>
<v Speaker 1>relaxed and efficient.</v>

359
00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:58.260
<v Speaker 1>You don't see a lot of jazz for</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bluetooth.</v>

360
00:15:58.270 --> 00:16:01.400
<v Speaker 1>Can you see a lot of jobs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like my all time favorite fighter?</v>

361
00:16:01.401 --> 00:16:04.310
<v Speaker 1>Probably if I were to tell you who I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>most excited to see you fight is</v>

362
00:16:04.311 --> 00:16:06.470

365
00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:12.680

<v Speaker 1>His legs jolted.</v>

366
00:16:12.681 --> 00:16:16.460
<v Speaker 1>He had like you could see his legs</v>
<v Speaker 1>stiffen up when he got hit by that first</v>

367
00:16:16.461 --> 00:16:17.210
