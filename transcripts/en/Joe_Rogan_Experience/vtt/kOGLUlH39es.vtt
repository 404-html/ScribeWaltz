<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2
00:00:02.251 --> 00:00:05.190
<v Speaker 1>I think some people would have been</v>
<v Speaker 1>different timetables and make it like,</v>

3
00:00:05.191 --> 00:00:08.580
<v Speaker 1>to me of be happy masturbating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like forever for life.</v>

4
00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:11.550
<v Speaker 1>I've looked at a canary or if you went</v>
<v Speaker 1>to jail for life.</v>

5
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.451
<v Speaker 1>For Life,</v>

<v Speaker 1>masturbating when it just like some</v>

00:00:15.391 --> 00:00:17.430
<v Speaker 1>sweet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sweet boy wants to suck your Doug did.</v>

8
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.300
<v Speaker 1>Unless it was like Justin Bieber style</v>
<v Speaker 1>or something like that.</v>

9
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.890
<v Speaker 1>So you would do it if it was a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>boy to do it if you looked under it.</v>

10
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:24.221
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

11
00:00:24.221 --> 00:00:24.870
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just kidding.</v>

12
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:25.650
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>

13
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy with masturbation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think masturbation is great.</v>

14
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.240
<v Speaker 1>I have no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now if I'm in jail and I have nothing to</v>

15
00:00:30.241 --> 00:00:32.070
<v Speaker 1>look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd probably have to draw my own women</v>

16
00:00:32.071 --> 00:00:33.160
<v Speaker 1>and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

17
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.450
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't just go from memory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would go for your own after a while</v>

18
00:00:36.451 --> 00:00:37.470
<v Speaker 1>you want to have memory anymore.</v>

<v Speaker 1>What'd you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what'd you kind of be too foggy?</v>

20
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.820
<v Speaker 1>I have some memories from my childhood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would drop right when it got in there</v>

21
00:00:41.821 --> 00:00:46.821
<v Speaker 1>and draw a vagina and boobs and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just so I have references for what they</v>

22
00:00:47.431 --> 00:00:48.530
<v Speaker 1>look like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

23
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.840
<v Speaker 1>You would think that at least they could</v>
<v Speaker 1>get them some fucking porn jail man.</v>

24
00:00:51.841 --> 00:00:52.960

27
00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.690

120
00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.950
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What just do Brian if said that to me,</v>

121
00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:59.150
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take it.</v>

122
00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:00.260
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

123
00:06:00.261 --> 00:06:04.280
<v Speaker 1>but let me go down on you first and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you would take his pants off,</v>

124
00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.460
<v Speaker 1>right and I would just like fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>start karate chopping his dick as hard</v>

125
00:06:07.461 --> 00:06:08.840
<v Speaker 1>as I could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you really think that's going to</v>

126
00:06:08.841 --> 00:06:12.020
<v Speaker 1>work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

127
00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:16.190
<v Speaker 1>you'd probably be hypnotized by it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a Cobra to a flute.</v>

128
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:20.030
<v Speaker 1>I would probably look at that big giant</v>
<v Speaker 1>black fucking snake in front of you.</v>

129
00:06:20.031 --> 00:06:23.990
<v Speaker 1>You might start out of fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would probably grab it as hard as I</v>

130
00:06:23.991 --> 00:06:27.890
<v Speaker 1>could and run as fast as I could to snap</v>
<v Speaker 1>it off.</v>

131
00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:39.490
<v Speaker 1>The worst crop Magog glass ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would be though the worst self</v>

132
00:06:41.121 --> 00:06:42.710
<v Speaker 1>defense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The structure of all time.</v>

133
00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:43.640
<v Speaker 1>Probably just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

134
00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:46.380
<v Speaker 1>this is what we want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably would do something deck</v>

135
00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:47.330
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd probably like,</v>

00:06:47.331 --> 00:06:49.640
<v Speaker 1>could you imagine if you had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was your fucking plan.</v>

137
00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:53.750
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if somebody hired someone to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a rape prevention course and you</v>

138
00:06:53.751 --> 00:06:56.570
<v Speaker 1>were the guy and that you would come in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were totally unqualified.</v>

139
00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.400
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to grab the Dick.</v>

140
00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:01.370
<v Speaker 1>We're going to run as hard as we can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've tried to rip it off.</v>

141
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:06.620
<v Speaker 1>You definitely people practicing like if</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got his dick and it's on the floor,</v>

142
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:09.260
<v Speaker 1>do you think he's going to be worried</v>
<v Speaker 1>about hurting you or Gideon's tick</v>

143
00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:12.710
<v Speaker 1>attached back to his body?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not going to spend the time to kick</v>

144
00:07:12.711 --> 00:07:13.730
<v Speaker 1>your ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trust me.</v>

145

<v Speaker 1>You pull his dick off.</v>

146
00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:17.590
<v Speaker 1>The fight is over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I called this move.</v>

147
00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:19.700
<v Speaker 1>Picking up the phone Dick to take the</v>
<v Speaker 1>grab,</v>

148
00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:23.760
<v Speaker 1>grab the balls as hard as you can and</v>
<v Speaker 1>just pull it up as fast as he can can</v>

149
00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:25.640
<v Speaker 1>own book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine that.</v>

150
00:07:25.641 --> 00:07:27.320
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if you were to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you're like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>but you might be able to rip someone's</v>

155
00:07:40.311 --> 00:07:41.810
<v Speaker 1>testicles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What might be possible?</v>

161

<v Speaker 1>got,</v>

00:07:54.141 --> 00:07:56.000
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to do now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's going to beat the fuck out.</v>

163
00:07:56.001 --> 00:07:58.680

250
00:11:42.241 --> 00:11:43.650
<v Speaker 1>eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We doesn't seem that dumb.</v>

251
00:11:43.651 --> 00:11:45.780
<v Speaker 1>He just seemed to fucking prison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got caught.</v>

252
00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:47.800
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a criminal Brian.</v>

253
00:11:47.801 --> 00:11:49.440
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of them were just there doing so</v>

254
00:11:49.441 --> 00:11:50.910
<v Speaker 1>much crime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just will get caught.</v>

255
00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.170
<v Speaker 1>You gotta be smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dexter didn't get caught.</v>

256
00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:56.590
<v Speaker 1>Oh Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he would rape you.</v>

257
00:11:57.780 --> 00:11:59.110
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he'd raped me,</v>

258
00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:01.060
<v Speaker 1>but I think he'd raped you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a,</v>

259
00:12:01.061 --> 00:12:03.280
<v Speaker 1>we'd have a problem though if he and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>were in jail together.</v>

260
00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:06.580
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you would not try to rape</v>

261
00:12:06.581 --> 00:12:07.680
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he definitely worked.</v>

262
00:12:07.681 --> 00:12:08.590
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

263
00:12:08.591 --> 00:12:09.690
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he probably tries to record</v>

264
00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:12.640
<v Speaker 1>everybody smoking cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

265
00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:13.481
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got a question.</v>

266
00:12:13.481 --> 00:12:16.480
<v Speaker 1>His gas tank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are we always talking about gay sex</v>

267
00:12:16.481 --> 00:12:19.930
<v Speaker 1>and this shit cause we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're tarting how many people are like,</v>

268
00:12:19.931 --> 00:12:21.770
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all they do is to book assholes until</v>

269
00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:24.430
<v Speaker 1>this is fascinating fucking guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

270
00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:28.060
<v Speaker 1>This isn't just talking about gay sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's fascinating to me is about this</v>

271
00:12:28.061 --> 00:12:32.380
<v Speaker 1>guy being so brazen about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's just talking about it and like</v>

272
00:12:32.381 --> 00:12:35.440
<v Speaker 1>he's obviously loving the attention and</v>
<v Speaker 1>all those cameras are putting on them.</v>

273
00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:38.200
<v Speaker 1>So I'm trying to figure out how much of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is true.</v>

274
00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:40.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to figure out how much of it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is just,</v>

275
00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:41.710
<v Speaker 1>he's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

276
00:12:41.711 --> 00:12:45.220
<v Speaker 1>exaggerating everything to seem even</v>
<v Speaker 1>cooler for this TV show because he knows</v>

277
00:12:45.221 --> 00:12:46.090
<v Speaker 1>they're going to air him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

278
00:12:46.091 --> 00:12:48.400
<v Speaker 1>he's probably a fucking star now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have TV in prison,</v>

279
00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:50.920
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they probably have seen this show and</v>

280
00:12:50.921 --> 00:12:53.440
<v Speaker 1>so I'm saying that he probably went out</v>
<v Speaker 1>and tried to rape somebody that night</v>

281
00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:54.790
<v Speaker 1>just to fucking celebrate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

282
00:12:56.070 --> 00:12:57.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if you can probably listen to this</v>

283
00:12:57.761 --> 00:12:59.170
<v Speaker 1>podcast and he's sitting there fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

284
00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:01.390
<v Speaker 1>if I ever get out of here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to show this boy.</v>

285
00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:04.520
<v Speaker 1>I'll be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be deputes asphalt school.</v>

286
00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:06.010
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry about it bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got them.</v>

287
00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:10.330
<v Speaker 1>We get them before he comes near you x,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would suck.</v>

288
00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:13.780
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no way we can end the show this</v>

289
00:13:13.781 --> 00:13:15.610
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yet we are doing it.</v>

290
00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:17.530
<v Speaker 1>I would buy that guy a fleshlight like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

291
00:13:17.531 --> 00:13:18.250
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>calm down second.</v>

292
00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:19.810
<v Speaker 1>That's not what he wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or the Guy Asshole.</v>

293
00:13:19.811 --> 00:13:20.660
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he likes it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

294
00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:24.370
<v Speaker 1>they have butthole flashlights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't feel as good holding a person</v>

295
00:13:24.371 --> 00:13:26.980
<v Speaker 1>down the hole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You be in panic and your blood,</v>

296
00:13:26.981 --> 00:13:28.540
<v Speaker 1>sweat and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It probably,</v>

297
00:13:28.541 --> 00:13:29.830
<v Speaker 1>that's what he probably looks forward</v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

298
00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:33.260
<v Speaker 1>Probably looks forward to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole domination aspect of it is</v>

299
00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:36.040
