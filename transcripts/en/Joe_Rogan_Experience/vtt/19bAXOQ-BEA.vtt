<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you out rushing to Russians?</v>

31
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:20.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>

32
00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.330
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say out rushing to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

33
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:24.620
<v Speaker 1>but that's what they do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

34
00:01:24.621 --> 00:01:25.540
<v Speaker 1>That's the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

35
00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.460
<v Speaker 1>I think only Russians can out Russian</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russians.</v>

36
00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.010
<v Speaker 1>So he's climbing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

37
00:01:31.011 --> 00:01:34.250
<v Speaker 1>how hard is it to get to this tower?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're looking at this video and I am</v>

38
00:01:34.251 --> 00:01:36.920
<v Speaker 1>fucking freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How high are you up here?</v>

39
00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.220
<v Speaker 1>This one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was like just over 200</v>

40
00:01:40.221 --> 00:01:41.054
<v Speaker 1>meters.</v>

41
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.180
<v Speaker 1>This is my staying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

42
00:01:44.181 --> 00:01:48.380
<v Speaker 1>He's hanging by one hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This one is the second tallest building</v>

43
00:01:48.381 --> 00:01:49.214
<v Speaker 1>in new crane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

44
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.530
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you go in the bottom and it's</v>

45
00:01:51.531 --> 00:01:55.250
<v Speaker 1>like a shopping center.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they took me like through all</v>

46
00:01:55.251 --> 00:01:58.220
<v Speaker 1>these little doors and then we took a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lift down into like the basement and</v>

47
00:01:58.221 --> 00:02:00.180
<v Speaker 1>then we walked through the basement and</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight another lift.</v>

48
00:02:00.181 --> 00:02:02.030
<v Speaker 1>And Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's standing on the edge here.</v>

49
00:02:02.031 --> 00:02:03.830
<v Speaker 1>Who standing yet?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You must thing again.</v>

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.390
<v Speaker 1>Oh my keys out of his fucking mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Fuck.</v>

51
00:02:08.391 --> 00:02:10.520
<v Speaker 1>This video is hard to watch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

52
00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.350
<v Speaker 1>So in these mosques and what your hair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

53
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.530
<v Speaker 1>what led you to this and how long have</v>
<v Speaker 1>you been doing this?</v>

54
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.740
<v Speaker 1>So I've done Porco for nine years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what Parkour is?</v>

55
00:02:21.741 --> 00:02:22.820
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jumping around,</v>

56
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.730
<v Speaker 1>all that fun stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That classes for little kids now they</v>

57
00:02:25.731 --> 00:02:26.780
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kids have pretty cool.</v>

58
00:02:26.781 --> 00:02:28.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Break their arms at about four years</v>

59
00:02:28.671 --> 00:02:31.850
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to a point where I was like</v>

60
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.340
<v Speaker 1>satisfied with what I was able to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

61
00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.500
<v Speaker 1>But I was still like super scared of</v>
<v Speaker 1>heights,</v>

62
00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:37.693
<v Speaker 1>so I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

63
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.190
<v Speaker 1>I know that if I want to get over this</v>
<v Speaker 1>fear of fights,</v>

64
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.720
<v Speaker 1>I need to do it face my fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So is this your stuff?</v>

65
00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is you running on trees and</v>

66
00:02:48.171 --> 00:02:53.171
<v Speaker 1>stuff and the whole idea behind</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] is to use the world around</v>

67
00:02:53.451 --> 00:02:57.920
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steps and fences and all kinds of crazy</v>

68
00:02:57.921 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>shit and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

69
00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:03.700
<v Speaker 1>you're essentially performing acrobatics</v>
<v Speaker 1>with all this stuff.</v>

70
00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:04.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just jumping around.</v>

71
00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the now how do you do this and</v>

72
00:03:07.271 --> 00:03:10.150
<v Speaker 1>not get hurt?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just practice a lot.</v>

73
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.730
<v Speaker 1>Like the whole idea isn't to go out and</v>
<v Speaker 1>just do crazy stuff and,</v>

74
00:03:13.731 --> 00:03:14.690
<v Speaker 1>and risk your life.</v>

75
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.700
<v Speaker 1>You start slow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start with small jumps and then you</v>

76
00:03:18.701 --> 00:03:23.320
<v Speaker 1>progress steadily and sensibly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then eventually you'll get to a</v>

77
00:03:23.321 --> 00:03:26.770
<v Speaker 1>point where you can do things that make</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people feel a bit sick.</v>

78
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.690
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did you start doing?</v>

79
00:03:28.691 --> 00:03:30.700
<v Speaker 1>Did you take gymnastics and snowed or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something?</v>

80
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.520
<v Speaker 1>I was like a little fat kid when I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>younger.</v>

81
00:03:33.521 --> 00:03:35.230
<v Speaker 1>Not Super Fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but unhealthy.</v>

82
00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:36.850
<v Speaker 1>Just played computer games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was it.</v>

83
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.750
<v Speaker 1>How were you able to jump so far too?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another thing that freaks me out.</v>

84
00:03:40.751 --> 00:03:41.820
<v Speaker 1>There's growing legs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

85
00:03:41.821 --> 00:03:43.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm six foot three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can jump.</v>

86
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.640
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of people that are six</v>

87
00:03:45.641 --> 00:03:47.590
<v Speaker 1>foot three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't jump from one building to a</v>

88
00:03:47.591 --> 00:03:49.720
<v Speaker 1>next.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I've seen some of the ridiculous</v>

89
00:03:49.721 --> 00:03:53.350
<v Speaker 1>ones where you jump from the top of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>building to another building,</v>

90
00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.740
<v Speaker 1>like on a very small ledge that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>landing on.</v>

91
00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This practice,</v>

92
00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.580
<v Speaker 1>you start with like the fuck do you</v>
<v Speaker 1>practice that?</v>

93
00:04:00.581 --> 00:04:02.740
<v Speaker 1>You stopped with the jumping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like four foot wide.</v>

94
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.060
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then as you get,</v>

95
00:04:04.061 --> 00:04:07.030
<v Speaker 1>but you do that hundreds and hundreds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>times until that becomes like nothing.</v>

96
00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:09.670
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you'll realize that you can now</v>

97
00:04:09.671 --> 00:04:11.560
<v Speaker 1>jump five feet and then blah blah blah</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah blah.</v>

98
00:04:11.561 --> 00:04:14.050
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my peaks like 1111 and a half foot</v>

99
00:04:14.051 --> 00:04:17.290
<v Speaker 1>standing jump and a half foot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

100
00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.750
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Duty should be in the Olympics.</v>

101
00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:24.790
<v Speaker 1>They are on another level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How far can like a long jumper jump?</v>

102
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:27.970
<v Speaker 1>Eight feet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 feet,</v>

103
00:04:27.971 --> 00:04:30.600
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the record's probably 2122 with</v>

104
00:04:30.601 --> 00:04:35.601
<v Speaker 1>the whole shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but still 11 feet in between buildings.</v>

105
00:04:35.621 --> 00:04:37.870
<v Speaker 1>Now when you're jumping in one buildings</v>
<v Speaker 1>taller,</v>

106
00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.190
<v Speaker 1>another building smaller,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gives you more time to,</v>

107
00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:42.520
<v Speaker 1>to travel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

108
00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:43.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>

109
00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.740
<v Speaker 1>like when you're jumping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw this one video of you were on,</v>

110
00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:50.860
<v Speaker 1>you were on the ledge and you leapt</v>
<v Speaker 1>across from one building to another and</v>

111
00:04:50.861 --> 00:04:52.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this has gotta be Photoshop.</v>

112
00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.080
<v Speaker 1>This can't even be real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one that you post are,</v>

113
00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.600
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

114
00:04:55.601 --> 00:04:58.570
<v Speaker 1>That one's in Cambridge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That one's actually a small jump because</v>

115
00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:03.340
<v Speaker 1>it's quite big height difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Massive impact because of the height.</v>

116
00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you've got alleged that's maybe like</v>

117
00:05:05.321 --> 00:05:09.490
<v Speaker 1>a foot deep to land on and then there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a scaffolding pole right in front of it,</v>

118
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.680
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you kind of slam into.</v>

119
00:05:11.681 --> 00:05:13.750
<v Speaker 1>You can see it in the video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I slam into that pole,</v>

120
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:14.980
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that,</v>

121
00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.500
<v Speaker 1>that's all part of taking the impact to</v>
<v Speaker 1>you use your arms as well.</v>

122
00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:19.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>

123
00:05:19.291 --> 00:05:21.250
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't seem like something could</v>
<v Speaker 1>practice a lot.</v>

124
00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.500
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Slamming into something that hard.</v>

125
00:05:23.501 --> 00:05:25.920
<v Speaker 1>Those ones you can't practice a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no.</v>

126
00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:27.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you figure it out.</v>

127
00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.210
<v Speaker 1>You figure out how to take impact and</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

128
00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.880
<v Speaker 1>So you started doing this about four</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>

129
00:05:33.881 --> 00:05:35.110
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You started doing the height stuff,</v>

130
00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:37.900
<v Speaker 1>started doing the climbing kind of scary</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

131
00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.140
<v Speaker 1>And when did you start releasing videos</v>
<v Speaker 1>right away?</v>

132
00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:45.400
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no I don't really,</v>

133
00:05:45.401 --> 00:05:47.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd released one though.</v>

134
00:05:47.151 --> 00:05:49.420
<v Speaker 1>This one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh this one makes me shit my pants.</v>

135
00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:52.000
<v Speaker 1>This is it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems so far.</v>

136
00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.390
<v Speaker 1>That seems so far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How far it's not that fun.</v>

137
00:05:54.391 --> 00:05:56.800
<v Speaker 1>Like you could jump to the lower bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>there quite easily.</v>

138
00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.420
<v Speaker 1>That's what other people have done</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

139
00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:59.760
<v Speaker 1>Into a pole arc.</v>

140
00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:03.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is bananas,</v>

141
00:06:03.031 --> 00:06:03.890
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

142
00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:04.720
<v Speaker 1>So how many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

143
00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.900
<v Speaker 1>how much is the distance between those</v>
<v Speaker 1>two buildings?</v>

144
00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:10.950
<v Speaker 1>Between those?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably like 10 foot,</v>

145
00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:14.240
<v Speaker 1>12 foot maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does not seem like it,</v>

146
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.230
<v Speaker 1>but didn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's because there's a big drop as</v>

147
00:06:16.231 --> 00:06:20.340
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more about judging it correctly and</v>

148
00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:22.380
<v Speaker 1>not jumping too far and not jumping too</v>
<v Speaker 1>little.</v>

149
00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:23.420
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

150
00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.410
<v Speaker 1>I see it like 12 foot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

151
00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.500
<v Speaker 1>Run that one more time Jeremy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to see this one more time</v>

152
00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:30.510
<v Speaker 1>cause this freaks me out every time I</v>
<v Speaker 1>see it.</v>

153
00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.670
<v Speaker 1>Every time I see it I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's gonna die for sure.</v>

154
00:06:32.671 --> 00:06:36.540
<v Speaker 1>There's no way you can make it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you kind of like lean forward and</v>

155
00:06:36.541 --> 00:06:40.080
<v Speaker 1>then swing your arms and then push off</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>

156
00:06:40.081 --> 00:06:41.520
<v Speaker 1>So you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like a standard.</v>

157
00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jump cause you're already committing to</v>

158
00:06:45.151 --> 00:06:46.380
<v Speaker 1>the jump as you like.</v>

159
00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:49.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could see it in your momentum like</v>

160
00:06:49.441 --> 00:06:52.470
<v Speaker 1>your head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause you have a Gopro on his above.</v>

161
00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:56.820
<v Speaker 1>It's past the center line of like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that beam that you're standing on and</v>

162
00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.260
<v Speaker 1>you're going out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's it called?</v>

163
00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:02.030
<v Speaker 1>And that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh that's the idea.</v>

164
00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.440
<v Speaker 1>Like you train,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you train enough so that when you're</v>

165
00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:06.930
<v Speaker 1>stood on the edge looking at something</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you have no doubt,</v>

166
00:07:06.931 --> 00:07:10.410
<v Speaker 1>you can't afford to have any doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I doubted myself there and I commit</v>

167
00:07:10.411 --> 00:07:12.600
<v Speaker 1>to it and Eileen and then I back out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm dead.</v>

168
00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:15.750
<v Speaker 1>I had him go crazy dream last night man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That I'm just remembering.</v>

169
00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:17.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a crazy dream that I was climbing</v>

170
00:07:17.881 --> 00:07:19.380
<v Speaker 1>with Alex honnold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

171
00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:23.190
<v Speaker 1>no Alex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alex has been on the podcast before and</v>

172
00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every now and then I'll think about how</v>

173
00:07:25.441 --> 00:07:27.990
<v Speaker 1>crazy he is about how crazy what he does</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

174
00:07:27.991 --> 00:07:31.680
<v Speaker 1>but how like mellow and she is about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

175
00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:33.600
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know when he's describing climbing,</v>

176
00:07:33.601 --> 00:07:35.340
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really actually kind of mellow.</v>

177
00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:38.700
<v Speaker 1>It's like if anything is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're really scared,</v>

178
00:07:38.701 --> 00:07:40.650
<v Speaker 1>so he's gone horribly wrong and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

179
00:07:40.651 --> 00:07:42.210
<v Speaker 1>really bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly the same.</v>

180
00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:43.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People think I'm like,</v>

181
00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:46.960
<v Speaker 1>hello and Adrenalin jumping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

182
00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:48.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says he fell,</v>

183
00:07:48.211 --> 00:07:51.240
<v Speaker 1>but unless you just fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She pulls it out right there then.</v>

184
00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:52.560
<v Speaker 1>There it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

185
00:07:52.561 --> 00:07:55.440

<v Speaker 1>Is this Alex?</v>

186
00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:56.970
<v Speaker 1>That's not hidden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't think so.</v>

187
00:07:56.971 --> 00:07:58.140
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like,</v>

188
00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:00.300
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

189
00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:01.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm not into that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>

190
00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:06.650
<v Speaker 1>That's too much trust in the backpack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything I do is like interesting</v>

191
00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:07.723
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

192
00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:09.450
<v Speaker 1>not into that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My friend Andy,</v>

193
00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:11.790
<v Speaker 1>Andy Stump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he does that wingsuit shit.</v>

194
00:08:11.791 --> 00:08:14.190
<v Speaker 1>He's got with a world record and</v>
<v Speaker 1>wingsuit flying.</v>

195
00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's out of his fucking mind.</v>

196
00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:19.920
<v Speaker 1>He just loves to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He gets to the top cliffs of the world</v>

197
00:08:19.921 --> 00:08:23.670
<v Speaker 1>and just throws his fucking body Hoff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it has like a squirrel suit,</v>

198
00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:28.420
<v Speaker 1>like the close proximity stuff where</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we watched one the other day where</v>

199
00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:30.120
<v Speaker 1>a guy slammed into a bridge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

200
00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:31.160
<v Speaker 1>He missed in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

201
00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:32.080
<v Speaker 1>I've seen that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

202
00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:34.530
<v Speaker 1>The sound as Rod.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why.</v>

203
00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:37.230
<v Speaker 1>Rough and expect it to be so loud.</v>

204
00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:38.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

205
00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:41.120
<v Speaker 1>The meat and those people on the bridge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

206
00:08:41.121 --> 00:08:42.770
<v Speaker 1>And his family were there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

207
00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:44.510
<v Speaker 1>That's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not good.</v>

208
00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:46.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

209
00:08:46.401 --> 00:08:48.840
<v Speaker 1>do you worry about that when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing these crazy jumps?</v>

210
00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:49.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I mean it's,</v>

211
00:08:49.951 --> 00:08:51.800
<v Speaker 1>it's in my mind like if I make a</v>
<v Speaker 1>mistake,</v>

212
00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:54.740
<v Speaker 1>that's it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't make mistakes.</v>

213
00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:56.640
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what you got to be confident and</v>

214
00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:59.460
<v Speaker 1>you've got to have confidence in what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing.</v>

215
00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:00.690
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're,</v>

216
00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:02.730
<v Speaker 1>if you're up there and you're scared,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

217
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:04.680
<v Speaker 1>The chances of failing are so much</v>
<v Speaker 1>higher,</v>

218
00:09:04.681 --> 00:09:05.700
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

219
00:09:05.701 --> 00:09:07.050
<v Speaker 1>I think with anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

220
00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:08.880
<v Speaker 1>you have to be in the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

221
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.160
<v Speaker 1>Well prepared in the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

222
00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:14.250
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much of what you're doing or is it</v>

223
00:09:14.251 --> 00:09:18.780
<v Speaker 1>really you taking a chance and how much</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it is just you having a better</v>

224
00:09:18.781 --> 00:09:22.050
<v Speaker 1>understanding of what your body is</v>
<v Speaker 1>capable of and the average person than</v>

225
00:09:22.051 --> 00:09:23.920
<v Speaker 1>most people I should say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not taking chances.</v>

226
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:26.700
<v Speaker 1>Maybe like 10%.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

227
00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:28.300
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

228
00:09:28.301 --> 00:09:33.301
<v Speaker 1>that's only on me taking shots and</v>
<v Speaker 1>trusting structures.</v>

229
00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:37.710
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe jumping to something that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not able to check first.</v>

230
00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:39.150
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it doesn't happen often.</v>

231
00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.030
<v Speaker 1>Every time I do it I'm like probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't have done that.</v>

232
00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:44.040
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also the,</v>

233
00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:49.050
<v Speaker 1>that you picking this up four years ago</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's like who's stopping you right now?</v>

351
00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:34.480
<v Speaker 1>Send my friend Simon is up there with me</v>
<v Speaker 1>and another friend Doug was there too.</v>

352
00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:36.400
<v Speaker 1>What do you think Simon and Doug would</v>
<v Speaker 1>do if you fell?</v>

353
00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:38.110
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just hurry up real down and oh</v>

354
00:14:38.111 --> 00:14:39.280
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go in one handed</v>

355
00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:43.830
<v Speaker 1>mother fucker dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what are you thinking?</v>

356
00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:45.690
<v Speaker 1>Why you're doing this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

357
00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:48.340
<v Speaker 1>Just like Alec Arnold said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not much going on.</v>

358
00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:50.890
<v Speaker 1>It's just me in that moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there is,</v>

359
00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:53.030
<v Speaker 1>you get a first time to eat breakfast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

360
00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:55.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But thinking about what you're going to</v>

361
00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:56.500
<v Speaker 1>eat for breakfast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

362
00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:59.690
<v Speaker 1>most of the time when you get to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>situation where you're about to do</v>

363
00:14:59.691 --> 00:15:02.990
<v Speaker 1>something that you've never done before</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you kind of naturally,</v>

364
00:15:02.991 --> 00:15:05.870
<v Speaker 1>your brain kind of hyped it up and makes</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seem a lot worse than what it</v>

365
00:15:05.871 --> 00:15:06.320
<v Speaker 1>actually is.</v>

366
00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:08.810
<v Speaker 1>And then you do it and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why the fuck was I scared of that?</v>

367
00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:12.410
<v Speaker 1>That was exactly the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like just scared of that because</v>

368
00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:14.900
<v Speaker 1>if you fell you're fucking dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

369
00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:18.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's not rocket science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a thick pole you're hanging on</v>

370
00:15:18.561 --> 00:15:20.120
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sound like a small poles,</v>

371
00:15:20.121 --> 00:15:22.040
<v Speaker 1>like super easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you do a one arm chin up?</v>

372
00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:23.090
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>

373
00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:26.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm not like particular stone fatigue at</v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

374
00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:29.270
<v Speaker 1>Please work on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should be able to do it when I'm</v>

375
00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:30.400
<v Speaker 1>channel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if your like what?</v>

376
00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:31.630
<v Speaker 1>Active limbs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

377
00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:33.080
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not easy to do one.</v>

378
00:15:33.081 --> 00:15:35.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm Chins when you have this big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's gotta be some crossfit guys</v>

379
00:15:35.421 --> 00:15:36.410
<v Speaker 1>that can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

380
00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:39.580
<v Speaker 1>I feel like strength isn't in my jeans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

381
00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:40.423
<v Speaker 1>Started out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that</v>

382
00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:45.200
<v Speaker 1>you were hanging from your fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how long did you hang for a,</v>

383
00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:46.490
<v Speaker 1>I saw him three times.</v>

384
00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:49.970
<v Speaker 1>Probably like 30 seconds each time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to hang 30 seconds.</v>

385
00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:52.790
<v Speaker 1>30 seconds is tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not when you like,</v>

386
00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:55.880
<v Speaker 1>when you do that all the time we'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff is swinging around and all that</v>

387
00:15:55.881 --> 00:15:56.870
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's quite easy.</v>

388
00:15:57.050 --> 00:15:59.570
<v Speaker 1>But most people overestimate the amount</v>
<v Speaker 1>of time that they can hang.</v>

389
00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:01.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I uh,</v>

390
00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:05.080
<v Speaker 1>we had this thing on fear factor where</v>
<v Speaker 1>people had to hold onto a bar that</v>

391
00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:08.420
<v Speaker 1>hangover like a river and a girls beat</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guys.</v>

392
00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:09.560
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

393
00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:11.540
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because girls don't weigh as much thing.</v>

394
00:16:11.541 --> 00:16:14.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the girls would be like 110 pounds</v>

395
00:16:14.061 --> 00:16:15.560
<v Speaker 1>and they'd be able to hang on for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of minutes.</v>

396
00:16:15.561 --> 00:16:17.210
<v Speaker 1>Where's the guys at?</v>
<v Speaker 1>About a minute and a half.</v>

397
00:16:17.211 --> 00:16:19.610
<v Speaker 1>There were all tromping off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

398
00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:22.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I weighed 200 pounds.</v>

399
00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:24.410
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot of weight to carry around</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your hands.</v>

400
00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:28.610
<v Speaker 1>Flat at the moment so that I don't know</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you could possibly allow yourself to</v>

401
00:16:28.611 --> 00:16:30.800
<v Speaker 1>get fat when you're not jumping across</v>
<v Speaker 1>every,</v>

402
00:16:30.801 --> 00:16:32.480
<v Speaker 1>I think every ounce is important.</v>

403
00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:34.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like backpackers lose weight so they</v>

404
00:16:34.881 --> 00:16:36.410
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have as much body weight</v>

405
00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:38.210
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to lose it.</v>

406
00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:40.340
<v Speaker 1>I need to sort my life out and start</v>
<v Speaker 1>your life.</v>

407
00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:43.370
<v Speaker 1>You're doing crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>

408
00:16:43.371 --> 00:16:45.680
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is like what you do professionally</v>

409
00:16:45.681 --> 00:16:46.514
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

410
00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:50.750
<v Speaker 1>How does that work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

411
00:16:50.751 --> 00:16:53.600
<v Speaker 1>what is a normal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a normal day.</v>

412
00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:56.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you go out,</v>

413
00:16:56.001 --> 00:16:57.370
<v Speaker 1>jump up and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

414
00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:00.560
<v Speaker 1>the normal day I do a lot of work behind</v>
<v Speaker 1>the scenes.</v>

415
00:17:00.561 --> 00:17:04.940
<v Speaker 1>Just like editing and emails and just</v>
<v Speaker 1>like boring stuff that people don't see</v>

416
00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:06.620
<v Speaker 1>this trait of duties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

417
00:17:06.621 --> 00:17:07.371
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has to be done,</v>

418
00:17:07.371 --> 00:17:10.670
<v Speaker 1>but it just works the same as any other</v>
<v Speaker 1>online influence.</v>

419
00:17:10.671 --> 00:17:12.260
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>And if you do something like that,</v>

421
00:17:15.561 --> 00:17:19.160
<v Speaker 1>that's a bit different and a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess crazy to most people.</v>

422
00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:21.650
<v Speaker 1>Even cooler opportunities come in when</v>
<v Speaker 1>it that's,</v>

423
00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:22.640
<v Speaker 1>that's it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you work directly with sponsors.</v>

431
00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:40.220
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna have to take it to next</v>

432
00:17:40.221 --> 00:17:41.240
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you walk into your hands?</v>

433
00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:43.580
<v Speaker 1>Can you walk in your hands on top of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russians?</v>

434
00:17:43.581 --> 00:17:46.490
<v Speaker 1>The Russians are walking on their hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't beat the Russians,</v>

435
00:17:46.491 --> 00:17:48.470
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't go too crazy.</v>

436
00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:52.460
<v Speaker 1>How many of them die a lot?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's,</v>

437
00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:56.220
<v Speaker 1>there's a few videos floating around of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people falling off cranes and shit,</v>

438
00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:58.280
<v Speaker 1>but it's super like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

439
00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:00.060
<v Speaker 1>that's not nice to look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

440
00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:02.550
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen those videos?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen any of these.</v>

441
00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:04.200
<v Speaker 1>I want to see him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

442
00:18:04.201 --> 00:18:06.750
<v Speaker 1>the wingsuit guy flying to the bridge</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other day,</v>

443
00:18:06.751 --> 00:18:09.920
<v Speaker 1>I thought I didn't want to see it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then I watched it six times in a row</v>

444
00:18:09.921 --> 00:18:11.340
<v Speaker 1>and blacks out before he hits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

445
00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:13.380
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you found that?</v>

446
00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:15.180
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

447
00:18:15.181 --> 00:18:19.290
<v Speaker 1>you see him bounce off the bridge and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>sounds like a car accident.</v>

448
00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:24.150
<v Speaker 1>It's a bang sound like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bang.</v>

449
00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:26.850
<v Speaker 1>But it sounds like a car accident.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

450
00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:31.080
<v Speaker 1>it's fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the screams afterwards that get me.</v>

451
00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:32.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all bad.</v>

452
00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:34.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of it's bad that people going,</v>

453
00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:35.083
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bone line.</v>

454
00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:40.190
<v Speaker 1>But that is half of the reason why these</v>
<v Speaker 1>people were watching is the possibility</v>

455
00:18:40.891 --> 00:18:43.110
<v Speaker 1>that that could happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though they don't want it to</v>

456
00:18:43.111 --> 00:18:45.120
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That accentuates thrill.</v>

457
00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:46.170
<v Speaker 1>It's a strange thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

458
00:18:46.171 --> 00:18:47.460
<v Speaker 1>Because I hate watching and stuff like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

459
00:18:47.461 --> 00:18:50.700
<v Speaker 1>but there's something in me that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't not click it.</v>

460
00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:53.610
<v Speaker 1>How could you say you hate watching</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that?</v>

461
00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:56.790
<v Speaker 1>Because you do dare devil videos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

462
00:18:56.791 --> 00:18:58.530
<v Speaker 1>I hate watching people die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

463
00:18:58.560 --> 00:18:59.393
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand that.</v>

464
00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:04.410
<v Speaker 1>But do you like watching people live?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you like watching people take risks</v>

465
00:19:04.411 --> 00:19:06.090
<v Speaker 1>and live or do you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh Jesus,</v>

466
00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:08.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really watch that much stuff.</v>

467
00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:11.430
<v Speaker 1>So you just do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just do stuff.</v>

468
00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:12.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

469
00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:15.850
<v Speaker 1>So do you look at like the competitors?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like is there like a,</v>

470
00:19:15.851 --> 00:19:18.540
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of you that are like pushing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>boundaries and you're like,</v>

471
00:19:18.541 --> 00:19:19.374
<v Speaker 1>Huh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>

472
00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:24.180
<v Speaker 1>I literally have no interest in beating</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people or making something better</v>

473
00:19:24.181 --> 00:19:27.210
<v Speaker 1>or more dangerous than other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no interest in that.</v>

474
00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:30.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing it because I love it and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>love making videos and you just see</v>

475
00:19:30.361 --> 00:19:33.930
<v Speaker 1>those guys that were walking on their</v>
<v Speaker 1>hands and they were doing flips and then</v>

476
00:19:33.931 --> 00:19:37.020
<v Speaker 1>they were doing hoverboards on the edge</v>
<v Speaker 1>of this building.</v>

477
00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:39.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That when I have a real problem as rough</v>

478
00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:43.260
<v Speaker 1>because I've been on hover boards before</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes you fall off,</v>

479
00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:45.990
<v Speaker 1>sometimes they fuck up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes they stop working,</v>

480
00:19:45.991 --> 00:19:50.310
<v Speaker 1>sometimes she goes wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're trusting and some cheaply</v>

481
00:19:50.311 --> 00:19:53.160
<v Speaker 1>made Chinese hunk of Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>

482
00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:55.870
<v Speaker 1>Oh you fucks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't.</v>

483
00:19:55.920 --> 00:20:00.180
<v Speaker 1>Oh he's spinning around in circles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spinning bothers me so much.</v>

484
00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:05.190
<v Speaker 1>And he's like literally like getting to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the edge and spinning around.</v>

485
00:20:05.191 --> 00:20:09.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean inches from fucking certain death</v>
<v Speaker 1>and moving quite quickly by the way.</v>

486
00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:12.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's that bad.</v>

487
00:20:12.451 --> 00:20:14.390
<v Speaker 1>Like shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course it's,</v>

488
00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:16.050
<v Speaker 1>I've been in one of those and it's quite</v>
<v Speaker 1>easy.</v>

489
00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:17.100
<v Speaker 1>Shut it off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>

490
00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:18.930
<v Speaker 1>He's got his hands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his hands,</v>

491
00:20:18.931 --> 00:20:20.940
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's standing on his hands on a fucking</v>

492
00:20:20.941 --> 00:20:23.160
<v Speaker 1>hoverboard on a building on the top of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

493
00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:25.680
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's crazy.</v>

494
00:20:25.681 --> 00:20:26.514
<v Speaker 1>These people are crazy.</v>

495
00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:27.910
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my hands are Russian.</v>

496
00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:29.280
<v Speaker 1>Russian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

497
00:20:30.370 --> 00:20:31.620
<v Speaker 1>they're different folk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

498
00:20:31.621 --> 00:20:32.454
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

499
00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:36.570
<v Speaker 1>They're their own species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are definitely wild folk.</v>

500
00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:38.640
<v Speaker 1>It's just the ability to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>

501
00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:43.420
<v Speaker 1>and this new thing that we have now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can take videos of it and just upload</v>

502
00:20:43.421 --> 00:20:46.070
<v Speaker 1>it instantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to have any sort of a</v>

503
00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:50.410
<v Speaker 1>network or anything that approves it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You put up your own thing and then boom,</v>

504
00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:51.970
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

505
00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:55.300
<v Speaker 1>you're a one man show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like the most amazing thing about</v>

506
00:20:55.301 --> 00:20:59.380
<v Speaker 1>youtube is it's like everybody has a job</v>
<v Speaker 1>on youtube.</v>

507
00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:01.450
<v Speaker 1>Anybody can go on Youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>upload stuff,</v>

508
00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:02.410
<v Speaker 1>get paid for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

509
00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:03.790
<v Speaker 1>That's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just so cool.</v>

510
00:21:03.791 --> 00:21:07.190
<v Speaker 1>And then if you make good stuff that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>inspiring people or people enjoy</v>

511
00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:09.430
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

512
00:21:09.431 --> 00:21:10.750
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So cool.</v>

513
00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:12.190
<v Speaker 1>It's very strange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

514
00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:15.580
<v Speaker 1>It's a completely new world that I don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>think that anybody anticipated that they</v>

515
00:21:15.581 --> 00:21:17.740
<v Speaker 1>were going to have individual content</v>
<v Speaker 1>providers.</v>

516
00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:19.570
<v Speaker 1>We're essentially going to be like their</v>
<v Speaker 1>own network.</v>

517
00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:20.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now how,</v>

518
00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:23.450
<v Speaker 1>what kind of an obligation do you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the people that are,</v>

519
00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:26.350
<v Speaker 1>that are watching your show?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how often do you post stuff?</v>

520
00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:30.040
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no like set schedule.</v>

521
00:21:30.041 --> 00:21:33.130
<v Speaker 1>I probably should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I grow a lot more if I had</v>

522
00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:34.690
<v Speaker 1>set that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the more I upload,</v>

523
00:21:34.691 --> 00:21:36.850
<v Speaker 1>the more I grow and that's just how it</v>
<v Speaker 1>works.</v>

524
00:21:36.851 --> 00:21:39.580
<v Speaker 1>But like how often can you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Common ground climb stuff every day,</v>

525
00:21:39.581 --> 00:21:40.414
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that.</v>

526
00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:41.320
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how,</v>

527
00:21:41.321 --> 00:21:46.321
<v Speaker 1>how many days a week a good month in</v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of like video uploads would be</v>

528
00:21:48.521 --> 00:21:50.890
<v Speaker 1>like three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three or four videos.</v>

529
00:21:50.891 --> 00:21:53.770
<v Speaker 1>One I was like good for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

530
00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:56.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because some people try to up hit,</v>

531
00:21:56.161 --> 00:21:58.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to do better but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's hard though,</v>

532
00:21:58.571 --> 00:22:00.250
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just given the nature of what you</v>

533
00:22:00.251 --> 00:22:01.084
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

534
00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:03.480
<v Speaker 1>And I live in the UK most of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>

535
00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:06.510
<v Speaker 1>the weather there is just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

536
00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:09.970
<v Speaker 1>you can't be hanging when it's raining</v>
<v Speaker 1>out and it's always,</v>

537
00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:12.370
<v Speaker 1>oh fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

538
00:22:12.371 --> 00:22:14.590
<v Speaker 1>you get up there and just do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but your friends are there with the</v>

539
00:22:14.591 --> 00:22:15.191
<v Speaker 1>camera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

540
00:22:15.191 --> 00:22:15.611
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was,</v>

541
00:22:15.611 --> 00:22:17.670
<v Speaker 1>tell what off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell it off.</v>

542
00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:20.920
<v Speaker 1>I've had a few Jewy situations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck.</v>

543
00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:22.151
<v Speaker 1>Climate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's normal.</v>

544
00:22:22.151 --> 00:22:24.210
<v Speaker 1>And then when you get to the top,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what it was like,</v>

545
00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:26.440
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where did this witness come from?</v>

546
00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:28.690
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you put that sticky shit on</v>

547
00:22:28.691 --> 00:22:30.760
<v Speaker 1>your hands?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like football players use football,</v>

548
00:22:30.761 --> 00:22:32.500
<v Speaker 1>American football.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sticky Shit.</v>

549
00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:33.560
<v Speaker 1>Like chalk or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

550
00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:37.030
<v Speaker 1>it was like for cars like glue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they spray glue in their hand,</v>

551
00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:38.160
<v Speaker 1>stick them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stick on his own.</v>

552
00:22:38.161 --> 00:22:38.810
<v Speaker 1>What's called,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

553
00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:40.480
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spray some shit in your hands.</v>

554
00:22:40.481 --> 00:22:42.220
<v Speaker 1>Make some sticky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

555
00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:43.113
<v Speaker 1>hmm.</v>

556
00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:45.990
<v Speaker 1>Thinking to taking it to the next level</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the sticky.</v>

557
00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:48.220
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if you're like hanging in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just kind of get off.</v>

558
00:22:48.370 --> 00:22:50.630
<v Speaker 1>Stripper's use it to allegedly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

559
00:22:51.010 --> 00:22:54.820
<v Speaker 1>some stuff that you could buy that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would,</v>

560
00:22:54.821 --> 00:22:56.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put on.</v>

561
00:22:56.590 --> 00:23:00.370
<v Speaker 1>I think they spray on their legs so they</v>
<v Speaker 1>could cling onto bars better and their</v>

562
00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:01.310
<v Speaker 1>hololens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

563
00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:02.303
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes sense.</v>

564
00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:05.440
<v Speaker 1>They also helps not getting like</v>
<v Speaker 1>calluses and stuff.</v>

565
00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:06.610
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense.</v>

566
00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:07.660
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't make sense.</v>

567
00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:10.360
<v Speaker 1>Because you think like it would you want</v>
<v Speaker 1>it to be lubricated then?</v>

568
00:23:10.361 --> 00:23:11.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

569
00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:15.280
<v Speaker 1>when they start to like get sore</v>
<v Speaker 1>blister,</v>

570
00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:18.000
<v Speaker 1>if I use chalk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't get that because they either rip</v>

571
00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:19.700
<v Speaker 1>shock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

572
00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:22.720
<v Speaker 1>I use chalk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I use truck for weightlifting and stuff</v>

573
00:23:22.721 --> 00:23:23.800
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sweat a lot though.</v>

574
00:23:23.801 --> 00:23:25.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm really sweaty hands for whatever</v>
<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>

575
00:23:25.531 --> 00:23:26.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm just a sweaty fuck.</v>

576
00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:29.440
<v Speaker 1>So when I watch your videos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I start sweating,</v>

577
00:23:29.441 --> 00:23:31.450
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started freaking out to change your</v>

578
00:23:31.451 --> 00:23:32.410
<v Speaker 1>clothes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

579
00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:36.100
<v Speaker 1>Like when I used to play pool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always found it really hard to use</v>

580
00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:38.320
<v Speaker 1>a pool cue that doesn't have a wrap on</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

581
00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:40.690
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like if it's just a,</v>

582
00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:43.120
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a piece of wood that had like a Polish</v>

583
00:23:43.121 --> 00:23:43.760
<v Speaker 1>or a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

584
00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:46.640
<v Speaker 1>a finish on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what I would do is I would get that</v>

585
00:23:46.641 --> 00:23:48.530
<v Speaker 1>stripper stuff and I'd put it on my</v>
<v Speaker 1>hands.</v>

586
00:23:48.531 --> 00:23:51.580
<v Speaker 1>And then that way it allows you to like</v>
<v Speaker 1>gently hold onto the pool cue.</v>

587
00:23:51.581 --> 00:23:53.870
<v Speaker 1>That sounds so dorky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

588
00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:56.990
<v Speaker 1>this stuff unfortunately though gets on</v>
<v Speaker 1>your hands and then you could transfer</v>

589
00:23:56.991 --> 00:23:59.150
<v Speaker 1>it to the balls and it makes the ball</v>
<v Speaker 1>stick to each other.</v>

590
00:23:59.151 --> 00:24:00.440
<v Speaker 1>It's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Good.</v>

591
00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:03.170
<v Speaker 1>So that's my knowledge of a stripper.</v>

592
00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:05.600
<v Speaker 1>Gooky stuff that you can have it on with</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>

593
00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:07.910
<v Speaker 1>but it's not stick them though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably something similar,</v>

594
00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:12.500
<v Speaker 1>but there's also a product that I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>used called dry hands that it's like any</v>

595
00:24:12.501 --> 00:24:15.140
<v Speaker 1>per sprint for your hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

596
00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:16.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found out about this cause I tried to</v>

597
00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:19.040
<v Speaker 1>choke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You seen that stuff?</v>

598
00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:19.940
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's that,</v>

599
00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:23.060
<v Speaker 1>it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it comes out like a Suntan lotion.</v>

600
00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:25.400
<v Speaker 1>Ah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it just rubs in and kind of</v>

601
00:24:25.401 --> 00:24:27.470
<v Speaker 1>dries out and make some pretty sticky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

602
00:24:27.471 --> 00:24:28.760
<v Speaker 1>I haven't heard of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Liquid Chalk.</v>

603
00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:29.750
<v Speaker 1>I bet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the same thing.</v>

604
00:24:29.890 --> 00:24:30.471
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

605
00:24:30.471 --> 00:24:30.940
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

606
00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:34.340
<v Speaker 1>essentially somehow or another they've</v>
<v Speaker 1>figured out a way to stop you from</v>

607
00:24:34.341 --> 00:24:36.200
<v Speaker 1>sweating if they spray some stuff on</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

608
00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:36.561
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

609
00:24:36.561 --> 00:24:39.470
<v Speaker 1>that's what antiperspirant is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a big thing that people like.</v>

610
00:24:39.471 --> 00:24:40.670
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they like to not sweat and their</v>

611
00:24:40.671 --> 00:24:41.504
<v Speaker 1>underarms.</v>

612
00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:42.710
<v Speaker 1>Disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

613
00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:44.160
<v Speaker 1>Fuck man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

614
00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:46.370
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really have a hard time just watching</v>

615
00:24:46.371 --> 00:24:49.430
<v Speaker 1>these videos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine if this is like the</v>

616
00:24:49.431 --> 00:24:51.250
<v Speaker 1>world that you've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

617
00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:53.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is the path you've chosen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your on your,</v>

618
00:24:53.721 --> 00:24:55.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in one of the top guys in this</v>

619
00:24:56.030 --> 00:24:59.390
<v Speaker 1>madness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

620
00:24:59.450 --> 00:25:02.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are not for me to say no,</v>

621
00:25:02.151 --> 00:25:04.130
<v Speaker 1>but I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean in terms of ranking,</v>

622
00:25:04.131 --> 00:25:06.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a crazy path to take with your</v>

623
00:25:06.951 --> 00:25:08.140
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What digital.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

625
00:25:09.261 --> 00:25:10.940
<v Speaker 1>It's unusual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

626
00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:14.870
<v Speaker 1>but I've never been kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never fit into like just the normal</v>

627
00:25:14.871 --> 00:25:16.460
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hated school.</v>

628
00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:18.650
<v Speaker 1>I ended up quitting school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like fairly early.</v>

629
00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:20.350
<v Speaker 1>No qualifications,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so high school I quit like two years</v>

636
00:25:33.021 --> 00:25:34.970
<v Speaker 1>before the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I was like 13,</v>

637
00:25:34.971 --> 00:25:36.140
<v Speaker 1>14.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 1>early.</v>

<v Speaker 1>So at 22 you're out there filming these</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking crazy adventures.</v>

646
00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:59.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What'd your parents think then?</v>

647
00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:03.080
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I started like I started a little</v>

648
00:26:03.081 --> 00:26:04.720
<v Speaker 1>bit of filming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the park or stuff.</v>

649
00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:09.050
<v Speaker 1>Maybe in like 2001,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it won't be in now what I was 17,</v>

650
00:26:09.051 --> 00:26:13.130
<v Speaker 1>18 was what I think I first I first made</v>
<v Speaker 1>a video and it was me just jumping</v>

651
00:26:13.131 --> 00:26:16.490
<v Speaker 1>between railings and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like small stuff,</v>

652
00:26:16.491 --> 00:26:17.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>safe stuff.</v>

653
00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:18.410
<v Speaker 1>Moms like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh that's nice.</v>

654
00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:23.420
<v Speaker 1>And now I remember what I felt shut out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that she was just like not the fuck.</v>

655
00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:24.820
<v Speaker 1>I think she hit me by the back of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>

656
00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:28.670
<v Speaker 1>How old were you when you showed her the</v>
<v Speaker 1>video of you hanging from the crane?</v>

657
00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:31.370
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I released it three is it goes right</v>

658
00:26:31.371 --> 00:26:32.720
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when you look,</v>

659
00:26:32.930 --> 00:26:35.420
<v Speaker 1>check this out mom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never show her.</v>

660
00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:37.820
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't really know about things</v>
<v Speaker 1>until I,</v>

661
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.040
<v Speaker 1>until the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the video is done and it's uploaded.</v>

662
00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:42.010
<v Speaker 1>That's a good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

663
00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:44.220
<v Speaker 1>So what did she say to you when she saw</v>
<v Speaker 1>that besides hitting,</v>

664
00:26:44.221 --> 00:26:46.280
<v Speaker 1>you did have to sit down was he never</v>
<v Speaker 1>hits me.</v>

665
00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:49.050
<v Speaker 1>It's usually just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think she was just freaked out and</v>

666
00:26:49.051 --> 00:26:49.980
<v Speaker 1>blown away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

667
00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:52.050
<v Speaker 1>But I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember.</v>

668
00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:55.800
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like encouraging words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

669
00:26:56.250 --> 00:26:58.950
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing right while you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing this and do you remember what you</v>

670
00:26:58.951 --> 00:27:01.890
<v Speaker 1>said?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not really.</v>

671
00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:04.110
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I usually just say the same thing.</v>

672
00:27:04.111 --> 00:27:05.400
<v Speaker 1>I enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just enjoy it.</v>

673
00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:06.753
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

674
00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:12.090
<v Speaker 1>Now was there any legal repercussions to</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing something like that?</v>

675
00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:14.310
<v Speaker 1>Have any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has anybody ever gotten mad at you?</v>

676
00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:15.780
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

677
00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:17.520
<v Speaker 1>In the UK,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not really,</v>

678
00:27:17.521 --> 00:27:18.900
<v Speaker 1>because it's trespass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

679
00:27:18.901 --> 00:27:21.060
<v Speaker 1>And there's no like criminal damage or</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

680
00:27:21.061 --> 00:27:24.000
<v Speaker 1>And Trespass in the UK isn't a criminal</v>
<v Speaker 1>offense.</v>

681
00:27:24.001 --> 00:27:27.900
<v Speaker 1>It's a civil offense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I can only get in trouble for it if</v>

682
00:27:27.901 --> 00:27:31.950
<v Speaker 1>the owner of the property for some</v>
<v Speaker 1>reason wants to take me to court,</v>

683
00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:36.450
<v Speaker 1>I sweating like a pig over here thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>of you hanging from that bar over that</v>

684
00:27:36.451 --> 00:27:37.860
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking sweating.</v>

685
00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:39.600
<v Speaker 1>My hands are sweating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my feet are sweating.</v>

686
00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:46.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry I interrupted you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But so it's just a civil offense.</v>

687
00:27:46.770 --> 00:27:47.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Uk,</v>

688
00:27:47.410 --> 00:27:49.140
<v Speaker 1>it's just a civil offense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if they catch you,</v>

689
00:27:49.141 --> 00:27:50.760
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you have to pay a fine or</v>

690
00:27:50.761 --> 00:27:51.594
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

691
00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:54.360
<v Speaker 1>the people that catch me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's usually just the police.</v>

692
00:27:54.450 --> 00:27:56.130
<v Speaker 1>Somebody sees me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>calls the police,</v>

693
00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:58.440
<v Speaker 1>the police come and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you doing?</v>

694
00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:02.430
<v Speaker 1>Try to kind of tell me off and then sent</v>
<v Speaker 1>me on my way.</v>

695
00:28:02.431 --> 00:28:03.600
<v Speaker 1>Cause there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing they can do,</v>

696
00:28:03.601 --> 00:28:05.010
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is good for me.</v>

697
00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:07.890
<v Speaker 1>What is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie makes climbing a tower guard.</v>

698
00:28:07.891 --> 00:28:08.850
<v Speaker 1>There's a guy up there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

699
00:28:09.450 --> 00:28:10.283
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this,</v>

700
00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:12.480
<v Speaker 1>this is the tallest thing I've ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>climbed,</v>

701
00:28:12.481 --> 00:28:14.280
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're in the middle of get up there and</v>

702
00:28:14.281 --> 00:28:15.810
<v Speaker 1>there's a dude up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

703
00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:18.630
<v Speaker 1>So I went up and then about 10 minutes</v>
<v Speaker 1>after I got to the top,</v>

704
00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:22.290
<v Speaker 1>the crane starts powering up like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like spinning and shit.</v>

705
00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:24.000
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the Hell is going on?</v>

706
00:28:24.001 --> 00:28:26.640
<v Speaker 1>Like somebody like got a remote for this</v>
<v Speaker 1>crane.</v>

707
00:28:26.641 --> 00:28:29.220
<v Speaker 1>So I climbed back down from the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's one of these,</v>

708
00:28:29.221 --> 00:28:30.930
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a little kind of thing here.</v>

709
00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:32.910
<v Speaker 1>And then that's the main arm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

710
00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:37.910
<v Speaker 1>So I climbed down from the backside and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then he's in his little room doing this</v>

711
00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:40.950
<v Speaker 1>crazy stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you're still climbing even though</v>

712
00:28:40.951 --> 00:28:43.320
<v Speaker 1>you know this thing's gonna move all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spoke to him and he said,</v>

713
00:28:43.321 --> 00:28:45.060
<v Speaker 1>hey brother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a little conversation and I was</v>

714
00:28:45.061 --> 00:28:46.230
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can I climb this crane?</v>

715
00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:49.170
<v Speaker 1>And then I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you,</v>

716
00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:54.230
<v Speaker 1>can you just like leave the crane still</v>
<v Speaker 1>lock it off for like 10 minutes while I</v>

717
00:28:54.421 --> 00:28:55.770
<v Speaker 1>do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I've come all this way.</v>

718
00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:57.330
<v Speaker 1>And what'd he say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>

719
00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:58.170
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

720
00:28:58.170 --> 00:28:59.280
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a nice guy.</v>

721
00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:00.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

722
00:29:00.210 --> 00:29:02.760
<v Speaker 1>And this has been moved down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bottom does in Dubai.</v>

723
00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:03.960
<v Speaker 1>This is in Dubai.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the Marina.</v>

724
00:29:03.961 --> 00:29:05.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was really cool.</v>

725
00:29:05.521 --> 00:29:07.800
<v Speaker 1>I love what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now when you're doing this and you're</v>

726
00:29:07.801 --> 00:29:09.870
<v Speaker 1>climbing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're worried about being</v>

727
00:29:09.871 --> 00:29:11.520
<v Speaker 1>arrested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause if you get arrested in Dubai,</v>

728
00:29:11.521 --> 00:29:13.290
<v Speaker 1>that's no joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

729
00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:15.300
<v Speaker 1>So they say I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

730
00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:16.680
<v Speaker 1>Dubai.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dubai's a funny one.</v>

731
00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:19.410
<v Speaker 1>I felt like they've got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like they've got bigger fish to</v>

732
00:29:19.411 --> 00:29:21.690
<v Speaker 1>fry and they're kind of dealing with</v>
<v Speaker 1>actual serious stuff.</v>

733
00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:23.480
<v Speaker 1>This what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

734
00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:26.910
<v Speaker 1>what happened when I got down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to like sit with all the site</v>

735
00:29:26.911 --> 00:29:30.960
<v Speaker 1>managers and everything for a few hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the main guy,</v>

736
00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:34.290
<v Speaker 1>like the site manager,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the main site manager said if they</v>

737
00:29:34.291 --> 00:29:36.390
<v Speaker 1>phoned the police,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll all lose their jobs.</v>

738
00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:39.390
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's kind of how it works.</v>

739
00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:40.290
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

740
00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:42.880
<v Speaker 1>So usually they beat the fuck out of you</v>
<v Speaker 1>and tell you don't come back.</v>

741
00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:45.510
<v Speaker 1>They don't know and never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

742
00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:46.870
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm joking,</v>

743
00:29:46.871 --> 00:29:50.050
<v Speaker 1>but they can't be happy that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing this right.</v>

744
00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:52.630
<v Speaker 1>And it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they also work because it just blew</v>

745
00:29:52.631 --> 00:29:53.540
<v Speaker 1>their minds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

746
00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:54.880
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time it's the same.</v>

747
00:29:54.881 --> 00:29:56.200
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't be doing this.</v>

748
00:29:56.201 --> 00:29:58.750
<v Speaker 1>They tried to tell me off and then when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

749
00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:00.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to me leaving they're</v>

750
00:30:00.311 --> 00:30:03.910
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can we take a picture with you every</v>

751
00:30:03.911 --> 00:30:06.060
<v Speaker 1>time you're so high up here man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How,</v>

752
00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:07.130
<v Speaker 1>how high are up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your right,</v>

753
00:30:07.131 --> 00:30:11.430
<v Speaker 1>it is 450 meters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What in the fuck is,</v>

754
00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:13.770
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just thinking of 450 feets</v>

755
00:30:13.790 --> 00:30:16.120
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>450 meters.</v>

756
00:30:16.130 --> 00:30:18.160
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's insanity one over the water was</v>

757
00:30:18.161 --> 00:30:22.000
<v Speaker 1>only 300 feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is like full times,</v>

758
00:30:22.550 --> 00:30:23.383
<v Speaker 3>full time.</v>

759
00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:27.470
<v Speaker 1>It would take you a long time to hit the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ground.</v>

760
00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:32.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah it would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So while you're climbing up here,</v>

761
00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:35.720
<v Speaker 1>what is going through your mind?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just being careful and watching</v>

762
00:30:35.721 --> 00:30:38.590
<v Speaker 1>your stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This one was like really greasy cause</v>

763
00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:43.070
<v Speaker 1>I've been for that for two years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the driver's head and it was</v>

764
00:30:43.071 --> 00:30:47.480
<v Speaker 1>just coated in like grease and dust the</v>
<v Speaker 1>air and fuck.</v>

765
00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:51.020
<v Speaker 1>It was like climbing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>climbing yet like somebody had just</v>

766
00:30:51.050 --> 00:30:53.930
<v Speaker 1>smothered it in moderation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

767
00:30:53.931 --> 00:30:56.480
<v Speaker 1>Just while I'm gone slow and I'm getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>my feet in the right place.</v>

768
00:30:56.481 --> 00:31:00.260
<v Speaker 1>And so the feet part of slippery too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything is like butter.</v>

769
00:31:00.261 --> 00:31:01.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christ,</v>

770
00:31:03.530 --> 00:31:04.550
<v Speaker 1>James,</v>
<v Speaker 1>James,</v>

771
00:31:04.551 --> 00:31:05.420
<v Speaker 1>James,</v>
<v Speaker 1>James,</v>

772
00:31:05.421 --> 00:31:06.740
<v Speaker 1>James.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you get up to the top.</v>

773
00:31:06.741 --> 00:31:09.150
<v Speaker 1>Please tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't hang from the top of this too,</v>

774
00:31:09.250 --> 00:31:11.420
<v Speaker 1>but it was just too slippery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

775
00:31:11.690 --> 00:31:15.020
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck you made a judgment call while</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're there.</v>

776
00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:17.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is such a mind.</v>

777
00:31:17.481 --> 00:31:18.770
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good Lord.</v>

778
00:31:18.771 --> 00:31:21.770
<v Speaker 1>You're up by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How awesome is Dubai credits?</v>

779
00:31:22.010 --> 00:31:23.540
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a crazy.</v>

780
00:31:23.541 --> 00:31:26.840
<v Speaker 1>A city that didn't exist just a few</v>
<v Speaker 1>decades ago.</v>

781
00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:30.230
<v Speaker 1>So cool man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of my favorite places mainly</v>

782
00:31:30.231 --> 00:31:33.380
<v Speaker 1>because you can do stuff like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where do you do when you get up to the</v>

783
00:31:33.381 --> 00:31:34.240
<v Speaker 1>top?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you just like put,</v>

784
00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:38.560
<v Speaker 1>throw your hands up like I'm the king of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world or do you have a jerk off up</v>

785
00:31:38.561 --> 00:31:41.240
<v Speaker 1>there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'd be a feat.</v>

786
00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:45.200
<v Speaker 1>It's a light up there in case a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>plane hits it.</v>

787
00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:47.710
<v Speaker 1>It's how high you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Oh,</v>

788
00:31:47.970 --> 00:31:50.990
<v Speaker 1>trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to watch.</v>

789
00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:51.830
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

790
00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:55.190
<v Speaker 1>how many hours did it take you to do to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get up there or how long did it take</v>

791
00:31:55.191 --> 00:31:56.540
<v Speaker 1>you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two hours.</v>

792
00:31:56.600 --> 00:32:01.600
<v Speaker 1>But it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the beginning was I got there at like</v>

793
00:32:01.851 --> 00:32:06.020
<v Speaker 1>three 30 in the morning and in Dubai</v>
<v Speaker 1>they start work at like three 30 or four</v>

794
00:32:06.021 --> 00:32:10.910
<v Speaker 1>o'clock because it's cooler and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like hundreds and hundreds of these</v>

795
00:32:10.911 --> 00:32:14.450
<v Speaker 1>dudes stood outside the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the entrance to the site.</v>

796
00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:16.130
<v Speaker 1>So I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the hell am I going to get into this</v>

797
00:32:16.131 --> 00:32:18.260
<v Speaker 1>place dark when this is all going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was pitch black.</v>

798
00:32:18.261 --> 00:32:20.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I managed to find like a little</v>

799
00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:25.900
<v Speaker 1>corner that I could sneak in and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>sneak over the fence and there's people</v>

800
00:32:26.031 --> 00:32:28.830
<v Speaker 1>everywhere and I don't know how I</v>
<v Speaker 1>managed to get in without them seeing</v>

801
00:32:28.850 --> 00:32:30.200
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then as soon as I dropped down,</v>

802
00:32:30.201 --> 00:32:33.240
<v Speaker 1>I just dropped to the floor and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>crawled across the floor between like</v>

803
00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:35.450
<v Speaker 1>these scaffolding bars and stuff like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

804
00:32:35.950 --> 00:32:40.070
<v Speaker 1>And then Tom Cruise mission impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had some cool situations,</v>

805
00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:41.930
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some really fun stuff.</v>

806
00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:43.970
<v Speaker 1>And then I get to the bottom of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>crane.</v>

807
00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:49.280
<v Speaker 1>So the idea is I get to the crane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I climb up like a bit of the crane and</v>

808
00:32:49.281 --> 00:32:51.560
<v Speaker 1>then I get into the building.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the easiest way.</v>

809
00:32:51.561 --> 00:32:56.561
<v Speaker 1>And usually because to climb the crane</v>
<v Speaker 1>for 450 meters is just like insane.</v>

810
00:32:56.930 --> 00:33:01.400
<v Speaker 1>Especially in that heat is a killer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I had like just one of these one</v>

811
00:33:01.401 --> 00:33:04.490
<v Speaker 1>bottle of wineries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you are your,</v>

812
00:33:04.491 --> 00:33:06.170
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it takes you a couple of hours and</v>

813
00:33:06.171 --> 00:33:09.140
<v Speaker 1>you're going through the building first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it took me a while to get up the</v>

814
00:33:09.141 --> 00:33:12.170
<v Speaker 1>crane and then in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I've got backpack and it's hot and</v>

815
00:33:12.171 --> 00:33:15.170
<v Speaker 1>it's like dry and it's hard to breathe</v>
<v Speaker 1>and wow.</v>

816
00:33:15.890 --> 00:33:17.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the wrong time of the year to do</v>

817
00:33:17.511 --> 00:33:20.870
<v Speaker 1>it really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I get in and then it's just</v>

818
00:33:20.930 --> 00:33:22.920
<v Speaker 1>stares and stares and stares.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

819
00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:25.580
<v Speaker 1>You get here at three 30 and everybody's</v>
<v Speaker 1>just showing up for work too.</v>

820
00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:28.970
<v Speaker 1>So they work three 30 until like early</v>
<v Speaker 1>morning and then they quit.</v>

821
00:33:29.810 --> 00:33:32.000
<v Speaker 1>They seem to work nonstop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those guys,</v>

822
00:33:32.090 --> 00:33:33.770
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how they do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not good.</v>

823
00:33:33.771 --> 00:33:36.500
<v Speaker 1>And that probably paid like two bucks a</v>
<v Speaker 1>day or something.</v>

824
00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:36.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

825
00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:39.640
<v Speaker 1>There was a whole a vice special on it</v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

826
00:33:39.641 --> 00:33:42.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the more unscrupulous builders</v>

827
00:33:42.261 --> 00:33:43.850
<v Speaker 1>out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they do is they go to third world</v>

828
00:33:43.851 --> 00:33:47.120
<v Speaker 1>countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They promise these people a certain</v>

829
00:33:47.121 --> 00:33:49.610
<v Speaker 1>amount of money and then they bring them</v>
<v Speaker 1>over to the life.</v>

830
00:33:49.810 --> 00:33:51.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they going to be able to send money</v>

831
00:33:51.591 --> 00:33:54.290
<v Speaker 1>home and change their family's lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they go there and take these jobs and</v>

832
00:33:54.291 --> 00:33:55.940
<v Speaker 1>they take their passports away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

833
00:33:56.030 --> 00:33:59.060
<v Speaker 1>We give them a fraction of what they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were offered and then they live in</v>

834
00:33:59.061 --> 00:34:01.670
<v Speaker 1>squalor through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I've seen it.</v>

835
00:34:01.671 --> 00:34:04.070
<v Speaker 1>They live like out in the middle of</v>
<v Speaker 1>nowhere and they will have these shared</v>

836
00:34:04.071 --> 00:34:06.980
<v Speaker 1>showers and toilets and toilet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a hole in the ground.</v>

837
00:34:06.981 --> 00:34:07.940
<v Speaker 1>It was awful.</v>

886
00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:01.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spice it up a bit.</v>

887
00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:03.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked dlt cups.</v>

<v Speaker 1>those are fun.</v>

889
00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:05.610
<v Speaker 1>That fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

890
00:36:05.610 --> 00:36:10.610
<v Speaker 1>But for a guy like you who experienced</v>
<v Speaker 1>is real life and death fears like that.</v>

891
00:36:11.461 --> 00:36:13.020
<v Speaker 1>Disneyland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit's gotta be boring as hell,</v>

892
00:36:13.021 --> 00:36:13.511
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

893
00:36:13.511 --> 00:36:15.270
<v Speaker 1>It was pretty boring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty Boring.</v>

894
00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:17.100
<v Speaker 1>But it's like something you've got to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>once in your life,</v>

895
00:36:17.101 --> 00:36:18.840
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bawled like a little Mickey Mickey</v>

896
00:36:18.841 --> 00:36:21.540
<v Speaker 1>Mouse and there's an adult version out</v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

897
00:36:21.541 --> 00:36:23.280
<v Speaker 1>You've got to go to six flags.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Six flags.</v>

898
00:36:23.330 --> 00:36:25.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the one that's opposite?</v>

899
00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:28.140
<v Speaker 1>California is something that's right</v>
<v Speaker 1>next to Disneyland.</v>

900
00:36:28.650 --> 00:36:30.050
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>California adventure.</v>

901
00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:31.133
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

902
00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:32.281
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really good.</v>

903
00:36:32.281 --> 00:36:34.050
<v Speaker 1>I felt like the rides were better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

904
00:36:34.051 --> 00:36:35.760
<v Speaker 1>it's more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're more adult oriented,</v>

905
00:36:35.761 --> 00:36:37.470
<v Speaker 1>but they have a bunch of kids rides</v>
<v Speaker 1>there too.</v>

906
00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:38.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

907
00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:42.540
<v Speaker 1>six flags.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Six flags is way more like the sum of</v>

908
00:36:42.541 --> 00:36:43.400
<v Speaker 1>their roller coasters.</v>

909
00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:45.990
<v Speaker 1>Just fucking ridiculous on their way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crazier.</v>

910
00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:47.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Way crazier.</v>

911
00:36:47.610 --> 00:36:49.200
<v Speaker 1>But it's a different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

912
00:36:49.201 --> 00:36:51.480
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more like older people.</v>

913
00:36:51.481 --> 00:36:54.950
<v Speaker 1>It's more like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like high school age and up versus</v>

914
00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:56.760
<v Speaker 1>Disneyland's is really fun for little</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids.</v>

915
00:36:56.761 --> 00:36:57.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Six flags.</v>

916
00:36:57.931 --> 00:37:00.780
<v Speaker 1>I got like a lot of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not even designed for little kids.</v>

917
00:37:00.830 --> 00:37:03.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that some of those ones where</v>

918
00:37:03.091 --> 00:37:06.300
<v Speaker 1>you go upside down some of the roller</v>
<v Speaker 1>coaster once and same one,</v>

919
00:37:06.301 --> 00:37:08.280
<v Speaker 1>what is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an x factor or something like that?</v>

920
00:37:08.281 --> 00:37:10.680
<v Speaker 1>X something out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should go while I'm here.</v>

921
00:37:10.681 --> 00:37:12.510
<v Speaker 1>I should check it out if it's a good</v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

922
00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:13.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's exciting,</v>

923
00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:15.360
<v Speaker 1>but it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're just thinking like,</v>

924
00:37:15.361 --> 00:37:17.940
<v Speaker 1>do a guy like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that kind of excitement is probably</v>

925
00:37:17.941 --> 00:37:19.410
<v Speaker 1>really bland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

926
00:37:19.411 --> 00:37:22.170
<v Speaker 1>But like I said before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's not in my control,</v>

927
00:37:22.171 --> 00:37:23.940
<v Speaker 1>it's still kind of gets me a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

928
00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:24.900
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

929
00:37:24.901 --> 00:37:25.820
<v Speaker 1>It's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

930
00:37:25.830 --> 00:37:28.020
<v Speaker 1>it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scares me a bit.</v>

931
00:37:28.110 --> 00:37:29.390
<v Speaker 1>Do you think long term</v>

932
00:37:30.450 --> 00:37:30.980
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

933
00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:33.320
<v Speaker 1>Little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

934
00:37:33.730 --> 00:37:34.910
<v Speaker 1>a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like,</v>

935
00:37:34.911 --> 00:37:37.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think long term is as far as like</v>

936
00:37:37.311 --> 00:37:40.370
<v Speaker 1>how long you can do this stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not really.</v>

937
00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:41.090
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

938
00:37:41.090 --> 00:37:44.150
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems to be the thing that people</v>

939
00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:45.440
<v Speaker 1>tell me the most.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

940
00:37:45.590 --> 00:37:46.730
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if this is your job now,</v>

941
00:37:46.731 --> 00:37:50.210
<v Speaker 1>surely you've got like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a limited kind of time to it.</v>

942
00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:55.520
<v Speaker 1>And like I'm 26 I would say I've still</v>
<v Speaker 1>got another 10 years of good strength,</v>

943
00:37:55.521 --> 00:37:56.420
<v Speaker 1>good health in me.</v>

944
00:37:57.260 --> 00:37:57.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

945
00:37:57.940 --> 00:38:00.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in that time I can build</v>

946
00:38:00.131 --> 00:38:03.940
<v Speaker 1>something else up so I don't need to</v>
<v Speaker 1>worry about what happens after.</v>

947
00:38:04.210 --> 00:38:09.100
<v Speaker 1>So do you want to stay in some form of</v>
<v Speaker 1>entertainment?</v>

948
00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:10.930
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

949
00:38:10.931 --> 00:38:12.580
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to have a good entertainer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

950
00:38:13.370 --> 00:38:16.900
<v Speaker 1>Consider yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

951
00:38:16.901 --> 00:38:18.790
<v Speaker 1>I hit you with all those career goals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just a dude,</v>

952
00:38:18.791 --> 00:38:21.920
<v Speaker 1>but what people call me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

953
00:38:21.930 --> 00:38:24.210
<v Speaker 1>You're a professional dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a little data.</v>

954
00:38:24.211 --> 00:38:24.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

955
00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:28.270
<v Speaker 1>It's a new disk distinction nation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like.</v>

956
00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:33.010
<v Speaker 1>So after I did the TV thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really enjoyed it and I've shot like a</v>

957
00:38:33.011 --> 00:38:36.280
<v Speaker 1>couple of pilots since then for things</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think I'd just like to,</v>

958
00:38:36.281 --> 00:38:38.530
<v Speaker 1>to have my own TV show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

959
00:38:38.890 --> 00:38:40.840
<v Speaker 1>Well doing what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what would you do?</v>

960
00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:42.220
<v Speaker 1>Do Crazy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

961
00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:46.180
<v Speaker 1>The idea in the moment that I shot the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pilot for is I travel the world and</v>

962
00:38:46.181 --> 00:38:51.181
<v Speaker 1>meeting other extreme athletes and I try</v>
<v Speaker 1>out what they do and that's,</v>

963
00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:53.200
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good luck getting insurance for that</v>

964
00:38:53.201 --> 00:38:54.034
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

965
00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:56.470
<v Speaker 1>That's going to be a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might have to shoot it on your own</v>

966
00:38:56.471 --> 00:38:57.780
<v Speaker 1>and sell it somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

967
00:38:58.200 --> 00:38:59.470
<v Speaker 1>Device.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like if,</v>

968
00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:01.630
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you do something like that and</v>

969
00:39:01.631 --> 00:39:03.000
<v Speaker 1>somebody falls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

970
00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:08.100
<v Speaker 1>Then when you do the show it</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if I was there and I filmed it,</v>

971
00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:10.150
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't know.</v>

972
00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:12.520
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if you show them falling and at the</v>

973
00:39:12.521 --> 00:39:15.220
<v Speaker 1>end you just put a smiley face.</v>

975
00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:20.220
<v Speaker 1>lol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lol.</v>

976
00:39:21.690 --> 00:39:23.650
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't see the actual impact.</v>

977
00:39:23.651 --> 00:39:26.920
<v Speaker 1>You just see a smiley face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe a bouncing smiley pace where they</v>

978
00:39:26.921 --> 00:39:28.630
<v Speaker 1>were going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>

979
00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:31.210
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then year dip,</v>

980
00:39:31.230 --> 00:39:33.700
<v Speaker 1>dip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all folks cut to commercial.</v>

981
00:39:33.850 --> 00:39:35.650
<v Speaker 1>By the time you come back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are thinking about other things</v>

982
00:39:35.651 --> 00:39:37.180
<v Speaker 1>are ready,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their phone's buzzing and people are</v>

983
00:39:37.181 --> 00:39:39.100
<v Speaker 1>texting them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to get laid.</v>

984
00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:42.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pizza got delivered or over it.</v>

985
00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:43.503
<v Speaker 1>I wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

986
00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:44.343
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

987
00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:47.280
<v Speaker 1>what would they tell you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you were doing something for a</v>

988
00:39:47.290 --> 00:39:49.930
<v Speaker 1>production company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think they would want to include</v>

989
00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:51.270
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

990
00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:55.270
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I surely they're not allowed,</v>

991
00:39:55.271 --> 00:39:56.300
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

992
00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:57.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are they allowed to do and not to</v>

993
00:39:57.881 --> 00:40:00.280
<v Speaker 1>do if people died in reality shows</v>
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>

994
00:40:00.281 --> 00:40:05.281
<v Speaker 1>I got to think they must've done that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reality shows have been around for quite</v>

995
00:40:06.311 --> 00:40:09.850
<v Speaker 1>a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's the kind of thing that would</v>

996
00:40:09.851 --> 00:40:12.790
<v Speaker 1>happen and then they'd</v>
<v Speaker 1>cut it out.</v>

997
00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:13.750
<v Speaker 1>It's not live though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was it?</v>

998
00:40:13.751 --> 00:40:14.950
<v Speaker 1>So you can cut it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

999
00:40:14.951 --> 00:40:17.020
<v Speaker 1>you would cut it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but everybody would find out.</v>

1000
00:40:17.210 --> 00:40:20.110
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a show footage always leaks as</v>

1001
00:40:20.111 --> 00:40:20.621
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1002
00:40:20.621 --> 00:40:24.790
<v Speaker 1>there's always something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there was a show in the early two</v>

1003
00:40:24.791 --> 00:40:29.791
<v Speaker 1>thousands where these people were doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a wilderness adventure type</v>

1004
00:40:30.491 --> 00:40:32.220
<v Speaker 1>show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a race through the wilderness.</v>

1005
00:40:32.250 --> 00:40:37.250
<v Speaker 1>They were on rafts or kayaks or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something along those lines on rapids</v>

1006
00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:41.520
<v Speaker 1>and a woman got trapped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1007
00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:44.230
<v Speaker 1>we've got wedge and a rock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her boat,</v>

1008
00:40:44.231 --> 00:40:46.150
<v Speaker 1>capsize weights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think she died.</v>

1009
00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:49.210
<v Speaker 1>And that was the first one that I had</v>
<v Speaker 1>heard of and I was like in the early two</v>

1010
00:40:49.211 --> 00:40:50.980
<v Speaker 1>thousands but there's gotta be a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 1>of them</v>

1011
00:40:52.910 --> 00:40:55.180
<v Speaker 1>because there's so many shitty reality</v>
<v Speaker 1>shows now too.</v>

1012
00:40:55.450 --> 00:40:57.280
<v Speaker 1>There's so many production companies</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are just,</v>

1013
00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:01.600
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are going to die.</v>

1014
00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:03.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People up must be dying already.</v>

1015
00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.190
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that something that you think about</v>

1016
00:41:06.191 --> 00:41:07.960
<v Speaker 1>when you're doing this show?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're hanging out with these</v>

1017
00:41:07.961 --> 00:41:10.780
<v Speaker 1>crazy Russian cats and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing these things,</v>

1018
00:41:10.910 --> 00:41:13.390
<v Speaker 1>it is a possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you do it a thousand times,</v>

1019
00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:15.530
<v Speaker 1>there is a possibility that one of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>times,</v>

1020
00:41:15.531 --> 00:41:17.590
<v Speaker 1>so I'm just going to fall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1021
00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:18.573
<v Speaker 1>I dunno.</v>

1022
00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:21.100
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been in situations,</v>

1023
00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:23.830
<v Speaker 1>it was one building in Ukraine where I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>sad.</v>

1024
00:41:24.130 --> 00:41:26.200
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you shared this clip where I'm</v>

1025
00:41:26.201 --> 00:41:29.530
<v Speaker 1>walking across the white beams and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like nothing underneath it.</v>

1026
00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:33.440
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we both walk out to the edge and</v>

1027
00:41:33.441 --> 00:41:37.610
<v Speaker 1>then Mustang climbs down and hangs off</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and I'm looking down at him and I'm</v>

1028
00:41:37.611 --> 00:41:40.580
<v Speaker 1>thinking like I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can create the image in my head of him</v>

1029
00:41:40.581 --> 00:41:43.820
<v Speaker 1>slipping and just disappearing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1030
00:41:43.821 --> 00:41:45.350
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had a few moments like that where</v>

1031
00:41:45.351 --> 00:41:48.350
<v Speaker 1>I've just kind of tried to imagine what</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would look like,</v>

1032
00:41:48.351 --> 00:41:51.740
<v Speaker 1>but it's not a nice thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1033
00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:56.510
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely not a nice thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's the whole reason why it's</v>

1034
00:41:56.511 --> 00:42:01.280
<v Speaker 1>interesting is because it's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if I was doing a video in here of me</v>

1035
00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:04.460
<v Speaker 1>hanging from a chin up bar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the only a foot off the ground,</v>

1036
00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:08.150
<v Speaker 1>nobody would give a shit if I'm there</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking everybody one arm.</v>

1037
00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:10.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just like James Kingston and do</v>

1038
00:42:10.870 --> 00:42:11.703
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

1039
00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:13.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1040
00:42:13.491 --> 00:42:16.100
<v Speaker 1>there's a floor below me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if I perform the exact same</v>

1041
00:42:16.101 --> 00:42:18.170
<v Speaker 1>movements that you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm not,</v>

1042
00:42:18.171 --> 00:42:20.390
<v Speaker 1>my life isn't in danger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not even interesting at all.</v>

1043
00:42:20.391 --> 00:42:23.450
<v Speaker 1>The only reason why it's interesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because your life is in danger.</v>

1044
00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:24.411
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's,</v>

1045
00:42:24.411 --> 00:42:27.140
<v Speaker 1>that's like one of the funny things</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it because it is a simple as</v>

1046
00:42:27.141 --> 00:42:28.460
<v Speaker 1>handing off a bar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1047
00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:30.620
<v Speaker 1>But people are just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

1048
00:42:31.070 --> 00:42:33.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if there's a small ledge.</v>

1049
00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:34.640
<v Speaker 1>Oh Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>

1050
00:42:34.730 --> 00:42:35.563
<v Speaker 1>Barefoot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

1051
00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:38.460
<v Speaker 1>How come you decided to go barefoot?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get bad grip barefoot.</v>

1052
00:42:39.850 --> 00:42:41.630
<v Speaker 1>Jesus son.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is that moment.</v>

1053
00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:44.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're standing up there looking at</v>

1054
00:42:44.181 --> 00:42:46.100
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just looking down on him and he's</v>

1055
00:42:46.101 --> 00:42:51.101
<v Speaker 1>hanging and then he'd like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does this stuff always go on one handed?</v>

1056
00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:53.840
<v Speaker 1>Oh Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only goes one handed for a little</v>

1057
00:42:53.841 --> 00:42:55.340
<v Speaker 1>bit and then he goes back to one handed.</v>

1058
00:42:55.370 --> 00:42:57.470
<v Speaker 1>Oh you fucker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>

1060
00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:00.680
<v Speaker 1>You're freaking me out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's just hanging there too,</v>

1061
00:43:00.681 --> 00:43:02.270
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's hanging in there.</v>

1062
00:43:02.271 --> 00:43:05.050
<v Speaker 1>He's still hanging in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's one arming it the entire time while</v>

1063
00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:07.100
<v Speaker 1>this security like patrolling around the</v>
<v Speaker 1>button.</v>

1064
00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:08.590
<v Speaker 1>No idea that were there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1065
00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:11.600
<v Speaker 1>the clang of his body weight hits that</v>
<v Speaker 1>ground,</v>

1066
00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:16.550
<v Speaker 1>that fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's laughing and smiling.</v>

1067
00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:18.650
<v Speaker 1>What is he saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>His hands are slippery.</v>

1068
00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:20.510
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a strange color.</v>

1069
00:43:20.511 --> 00:43:22.460
<v Speaker 1>Like you'd end up with like chalky</v>
<v Speaker 1>hands,</v>

1070
00:43:22.461 --> 00:43:24.800
<v Speaker 1>but it was like a purple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He kind of color from the paint.</v>

1071
00:43:24.890 --> 00:43:26.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow Dude.</v>

1072
00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:27.940
<v Speaker 1>You guys ready?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's wearing sneakers.</v>

1073
00:43:27.950 --> 00:43:29.170
<v Speaker 1>That's the security down there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let,</v>

1074
00:43:29.450 --> 00:43:34.450
<v Speaker 1>oh Jesus dog as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jump on that dog right from there dude.</v>

1075
00:43:36.201 --> 00:43:38.810
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have this,</v>

1076
00:43:38.811 --> 00:43:42.920
<v Speaker 1>a desire to like keep upping the ante?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that an issue?</v>

1077
00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:46.310
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not really.</v>

1078
00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:47.480
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just like,</v>

1079
00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:51.340
<v Speaker 1>ultimately I just like creating stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I liked making videos and I liked</v>

1080
00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:52.940
<v Speaker 1>exploring places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like heights,</v>

1081
00:43:52.970 --> 00:43:57.970
<v Speaker 1>I like jumping between stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the natural progression for me is</v>

1082
00:43:58.341 --> 00:44:00.320
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to get higher and things get bigger.</v>

1083
00:44:00.321 --> 00:44:02.360
<v Speaker 1>That's just how it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it just happens.</v>

1084
00:44:02.361 --> 00:44:05.070
<v Speaker 1>But bright but not thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not thinking like,</v>

1085
00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:07.040
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've just released this so now I need to</v>

1086
00:44:07.041 --> 00:44:09.650
<v Speaker 1>do something bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's just there.</v>

1087
00:44:09.651 --> 00:44:12.560
<v Speaker 1>It's just not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how do you go about making a video?</v>

1088
00:44:12.561 --> 00:44:14.480
<v Speaker 1>If you decide I'm going to make a new</v>
<v Speaker 1>video,</v>

1089
00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:16.220
<v Speaker 1>like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have a thought in your head like,</v>

1090
00:44:16.221 --> 00:44:17.840
<v Speaker 1>I need to get on the Eiffel Tower?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

1091
00:44:17.910 --> 00:44:19.850
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Eiffel Tower was?</v>

1092
00:44:19.851 --> 00:44:21.380
<v Speaker 1>Never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never a plan.</v>

1093
00:44:21.381 --> 00:44:24.350
<v Speaker 1>I never thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go to Paris and do the Eiffel</v>

1094
00:44:24.350 --> 00:44:25.380
<v Speaker 1>Tower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you do the Eiffel Tower?</v>

1095
00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:29.120
<v Speaker 1>So how'd you do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's not a plan,</v>

1096
00:44:29.121 --> 00:44:31.160
<v Speaker 1>how'd you do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was in Denmark just traveling</v>

1097
00:44:31.170 --> 00:44:34.920
<v Speaker 1>around with a bunch of friends and</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of getting in the minivan and</v>

1098
00:44:34.921 --> 00:44:37.020
<v Speaker 1>driving all the way back to London,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1099
00:44:37.021 --> 00:44:39.060
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to sit in a van for 15</v>

1100
00:44:39.061 --> 00:44:41.580
<v Speaker 1>hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's just fly somewhere and continue</v>

1101
00:44:41.581 --> 00:44:45.120
<v Speaker 1>this adventure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So me and my friend flew to Paris and</v>

1102
00:44:45.121 --> 00:44:48.300
<v Speaker 1>then the next day we ended up climbing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now for tower.</v>

1103
00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:51.840
<v Speaker 1>Do you think this kind of stuff was</v>
<v Speaker 1>being done before people were</v>

1104
00:44:51.841 --> 00:44:54.150
<v Speaker 1>videotaping it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like was this must've been,</v>

1105
00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:57.600
<v Speaker 1>it must have been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like for certain people it's just</v>

1106
00:44:57.601 --> 00:44:59.730
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just in them to kind of explore</v>

1107
00:44:59.731 --> 00:45:02.820
<v Speaker 1>places you shouldn't really explore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think he's,</v>

1108
00:45:02.850 --> 00:45:03.510
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1109
00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:05.820
<v Speaker 1>for you it seems like something that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>fostered though,</v>

1110
00:45:05.821 --> 00:45:07.650
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you started off just doing the</v>

1111
00:45:07.651 --> 00:45:10.380
<v Speaker 1>par course tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this became of it.</v>

1112
00:45:10.970 --> 00:45:12.030
<v Speaker 1>But you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I was a kid,</v>

1113
00:45:12.031 --> 00:45:13.650
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was annoying little kid.</v>

1114
00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:16.360
<v Speaker 1>I was always do things that I shouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>

1115
00:45:16.410 --> 00:45:17.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1116
00:45:18.130 --> 00:45:21.720
<v Speaker 1>And I mean now I'm just a big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a big version of what I was then.</v>

1117
00:45:21.930 --> 00:45:22.763
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>

1118
00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:24.380
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

1119
00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:25.860
<v Speaker 5>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's some pretty cool videos.</v>

1120
00:45:25.861 --> 00:45:28.880
<v Speaker 5>If you look up on youtube of like urban</v>
<v Speaker 5>exploration and people were finding</v>

1121
00:45:28.890 --> 00:45:31.110
<v Speaker 5>weird pathways and like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh shit.</v>

1122
00:45:31.111 --> 00:45:33.810
<v Speaker 5>Looked on 60 feet underground,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we made it and there's this shit that's</v>

1123
00:45:33.811 --> 00:45:37.140
<v Speaker 5>been buried under here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wonder why it's buried and look old</v>

1124
00:45:37.141 --> 00:45:40.860
<v Speaker 5>electronics fifties and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like under like uncovering the hatch and</v>

1125
00:45:40.861 --> 00:45:42.750
<v Speaker 5>lost.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it was sort of like that.</v>

1126
00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:43.810
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1127
00:45:43.930 --> 00:45:45.640
<v Speaker 1>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's very interesting to me.</v>

1128
00:45:45.641 --> 00:45:49.150
<v Speaker 1>But what I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm really most fascinated by is</v>

1129
00:45:49.151 --> 00:45:52.390
<v Speaker 1>this willingness to put your life in</v>
<v Speaker 1>mortal danger.</v>

1130
00:45:53.410 --> 00:45:54.180
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1131
00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:56.340
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how exciting this is for people to</v>

1132
00:45:56.341 --> 00:45:58.170
<v Speaker 1>watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what's the most viewed video that</v>

1133
00:45:58.171 --> 00:45:59.520
<v Speaker 1>you have?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many hits does it have?</v>

1134
00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:02.250
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think just over 4 million</v>

1135
00:46:04.770 --> 00:46:05.660
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1136
00:46:07.170 --> 00:46:09.080
<v Speaker 1>this one's got a few million I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1137
00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:10.730
<v Speaker 1>this is you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get,</v>

1138
00:46:11.450 --> 00:46:12.480
<v Speaker 1>so we climbed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We went,</v>

1139
00:46:12.540 --> 00:46:15.870
<v Speaker 1>we just pushed it too far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we went up to the very top</v>

1140
00:46:15.871 --> 00:46:17.160
<v Speaker 1>platform.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you've been to Paris,</v>

1141
00:46:17.490 --> 00:46:18.780
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it didn't say off the tower.</v>

1142
00:46:19.710 --> 00:46:21.150
<v Speaker 1>So you can take the lift up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1143
00:46:21.250 --> 00:46:22.270
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can walk.</v>

1144
00:46:22.271 --> 00:46:24.120
<v Speaker 1>Can you take the stairs to the second</v>
<v Speaker 1>platform?</v>

1145
00:46:24.121 --> 00:46:25.650
<v Speaker 1>That's the highest you can take the</v>
<v Speaker 1>stairs too.</v>

1146
00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:28.290
<v Speaker 1>There is stairs to the top,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't allow it because they're</v>

1147
00:46:28.291 --> 00:46:32.490
<v Speaker 1>like weird and narrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you take the lift to the top and</v>

1148
00:46:32.491 --> 00:46:36.510
<v Speaker 1>then there's like a door that's always</v>
<v Speaker 1>manned by a security guard that is the</v>

1149
00:46:36.511 --> 00:46:37.470
<v Speaker 1>door to that staircase.</v>

1150
00:46:37.470 --> 00:46:39.240
<v Speaker 1>And that's what we came up from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>backside.</v>

1151
00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:40.680
<v Speaker 1>So we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we went up,</v>

1152
00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:43.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for some reason we just had the urge to</v>

1153
00:46:43.171 --> 00:46:46.260
<v Speaker 1>just go inside even though it's lit up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though there's cameras everywhere.</v>

1154
00:46:47.050 --> 00:46:48.210
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we opened that door,</v>

1155
00:46:48.211 --> 00:46:52.200
<v Speaker 1>I step in to the top platform and then I</v>
<v Speaker 1>just hear this,</v>

1156
00:46:52.201 --> 00:46:54.300
<v Speaker 1>this walkie talkie just go like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

1157
00:46:54.510 --> 00:46:57.480
<v Speaker 1>like you go crazy and French.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

1158
00:46:57.481 --> 00:46:59.520
<v Speaker 1>Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've definitely been seen.</v>

1159
00:46:59.521 --> 00:47:01.710
<v Speaker 1>Let's disappear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then we ran down,</v>

1160
00:47:02.030 --> 00:47:05.250
<v Speaker 1>we climbed out of the staircase and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>on each,</v>

1161
00:47:05.310 --> 00:47:08.970
<v Speaker 1>on opposite corners of the tower in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>main beams,</v>

1162
00:47:08.971 --> 00:47:13.530
<v Speaker 1>there's like kind of like a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>pocket inside the beam that you can jump</v>

1163
00:47:13.531 --> 00:47:16.140
<v Speaker 1>into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It must be like two by two.</v>

1164
00:47:16.141 --> 00:47:18.940
<v Speaker 1>Like size.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I barely for intimate,</v>

1165
00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:19.830
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause I'm huge.</v>

1166
00:47:20.010 --> 00:47:23.160
<v Speaker 1>My friend is small.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you just like Brooke disappeared into</v>

1167
00:47:23.161 --> 00:47:28.161
<v Speaker 1>this hole and then we sat on opposite</v>
<v Speaker 1>ends of the tower and hid and the lifts,</v>

1168
00:47:28.231 --> 00:47:30.880
<v Speaker 1>you start hitting lifts coming up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start hitting people running up and</v>

1169
00:47:30.881 --> 00:47:31.030
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

1170
00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:34.900
<v Speaker 1>The stairs you see taught is</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything's kicking off and we're</v>

1171
00:47:34.901 --> 00:47:38.920
<v Speaker 1>hitting these little holes</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're searching for us.</v>

1172
00:47:38.921 --> 00:47:41.830
<v Speaker 1>And I'm just like hiding in this hole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

1173
00:47:41.890 --> 00:47:43.960
<v Speaker 1>I've got one shoe off because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't fit in.</v>

1174
00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:47.920
<v Speaker 1>I've got my knee wrestling on my shoe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've lost all feeling in my leg because</v>

1175
00:47:47.921 --> 00:47:51.330
<v Speaker 1>the blood circulation has gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My head's sticking out the top and I've</v>

1176
00:47:51.331 --> 00:47:56.260
<v Speaker 1>got like my tee shirt of my head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a little Ninja and this people with</v>

1177
00:47:56.330 --> 00:47:58.060
<v Speaker 1>torches going up and down looking for</v>
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>

1178
00:47:58.540 --> 00:48:02.050
<v Speaker 1>So do you have video on that little</v>
<v Speaker 1>pocket that you were in?</v>

1179
00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:05.530
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not in this,</v>

1180
00:48:05.531 --> 00:48:06.364
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do have,</v>

1181
00:48:07.330 --> 00:48:10.000
<v Speaker 1>it's only on two sides of the tower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is strange,</v>

1182
00:48:10.060 --> 00:48:11.920
<v Speaker 1>but it's kind of similar to this gap</v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

1183
00:48:11.970 --> 00:48:12.430
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>

1184
00:48:12.430 --> 00:48:14.680
<v Speaker 1>It's there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in the right in that corner there.</v>

1185
00:48:14.681 --> 00:48:15.514
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>

1186
00:48:15.700 --> 00:48:17.710
<v Speaker 1>And it's like a foot and a half by a</v>
<v Speaker 1>foot and a half.</v>

1187
00:48:17.711 --> 00:48:21.250
<v Speaker 1>I think I barely fit in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how long did they wait?</v>

1188
00:48:21.460 --> 00:48:24.130
<v Speaker 1>So we're in the room in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was coming up right now.</v>

1189
00:48:24.340 --> 00:48:26.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what it was starting to open up.</v>

1190
00:48:26.590 --> 00:48:29.000
<v Speaker 1>This was like as we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this is like right where as here,</v>

1191
00:48:29.010 --> 00:48:30.000
<v Speaker 1>just before we go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

1192
00:48:30.090 --> 00:48:31.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So He'd tucked in.</v>

1193
00:48:31.940 --> 00:48:34.720
<v Speaker 1>It was just before he got caught.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how'd you get caught?</v>

1194
00:48:35.350 --> 00:48:37.430
<v Speaker 1>Because the lifts started coming up</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of that.</v>

1195
00:48:37.460 --> 00:48:42.100
<v Speaker 1>The staff start coming up to work or to</v>
<v Speaker 1>clean or something and they just saw us.</v>

1196
00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:45.160
<v Speaker 1>We're just like running around these</v>
<v Speaker 1>beams and there's lifts everywhere.</v>

1197
00:48:47.650 --> 00:48:49.490
<v Speaker 1>So what happens then?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it like,</v>

1198
00:48:49.510 --> 00:48:52.240
<v Speaker 1>so we're still in this hole and we sit</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this whole for like two hours,</v>

1199
00:48:52.241 --> 00:48:54.640
<v Speaker 1>at least two hours where they're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>up and down.</v>

1200
00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:57.010
<v Speaker 1>It goes quiet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I jumped out of the hole.</v>

1201
00:48:57.370 --> 00:48:58.980
<v Speaker 1>I have a look around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go and see stevie.</v>

1202
00:48:58.981 --> 00:49:02.770
<v Speaker 1>Stevie's like half asleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just chilling in the hole and then</v>

1203
00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:05.890
<v Speaker 1>come back to the whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1204
00:49:05.891 --> 00:49:07.960
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems like pretty clear now.</v>

1205
00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:11.920
<v Speaker 1>I think they must have thought that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>jumped off with parachutes and we would</v>

1206
00:49:12.050 --> 00:49:14.890
<v Speaker 1>go because they couldn't find us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I was like,</v>

1207
00:49:14.891 --> 00:49:16.270
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this seems pretty clear.</v>

1208
00:49:16.271 --> 00:49:19.750
<v Speaker 1>And then every single light on the tower</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes,</v>

1209
00:49:21.010 --> 00:49:24.190
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing lights up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this isn't like the twinkly lights</v>

1210
00:49:24.191 --> 00:49:28.180
<v Speaker 1>that they have on every hour at night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is like internal lights that are</v>

1211
00:49:28.181 --> 00:49:33.181
<v Speaker 1>like this big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the whole fucking tower up.</v>

1212
00:49:34.150 --> 00:49:36.320
<v Speaker 1>So I jumped straight back in the hole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1213
00:49:36.550 --> 00:49:38.530
<v Speaker 1>what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then lifts again,</v>

1214
00:49:38.531 --> 00:49:41.200
<v Speaker 1>people up and down the stairs again</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking for us.</v>

1215
00:49:41.770 --> 00:49:44.230
<v Speaker 1>So when we sat in these holes again for</v>
<v Speaker 1>ages</v>

1216
00:49:45.730 --> 00:49:48.280
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it finally goes quiet,</v>

1217
00:49:48.420 --> 00:49:51.700
<v Speaker 1>the lights are still on for a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>while and then the whole thing just</v>

1218
00:49:51.970 --> 00:49:54.040
<v Speaker 1>shuts down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that was it.</v>

1219
00:49:54.190 --> 00:49:56.260
<v Speaker 1>So I jumped out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a look around to went and got</v>

1220
00:49:56.261 --> 00:50:00.790
<v Speaker 1>stevie and then it was ours again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we were up there until like</v>

1221
00:50:00.910 --> 00:50:03.160
<v Speaker 1>9:00 AM I think it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long was that?</v>

1222
00:50:03.220 --> 00:50:05.650
<v Speaker 1>How many hours?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A 1:00 AM til 9:00 AM.</v>

1223
00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:08.440
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you were climbing around I think for</v>

1224
00:50:08.441 --> 00:50:10.600
<v Speaker 1>eight fucking hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's nuts.</v>

1225
00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:12.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Running some.</v>

1226
00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:14.740
<v Speaker 1>That French chocolate barb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was really good.</v>

1227
00:50:15.250 --> 00:50:15.941
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all you eat.</v>

1228
00:50:15.941 --> 00:50:16.780
<v Speaker 1>It's all we had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1229
00:50:17.910 --> 00:50:20.830
<v Speaker 1>So he came down because you were hungry</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we came down because we got caught</v>

1230
00:50:21.300 --> 00:50:21.610
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

1231
00:50:21.610 --> 00:50:24.370
<v Speaker 1>And so you would have stayed there for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest of the day.</v>

1232
00:50:24.420 --> 00:50:28.310
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea was to like wait till it opened</v>

1233
00:50:28.790 --> 00:50:31.640
<v Speaker 1>and then get into a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a place where you could hide like near</v>

1234
00:50:31.641 --> 00:50:34.850
<v Speaker 1>the second platform and then just drop</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the second platform and just merge</v>

1235
00:50:34.851 --> 00:50:37.970
<v Speaker 1>in was like the tourists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we didn't get that far.</v>

1236
00:50:38.180 --> 00:50:42.560
<v Speaker 1>That would have been car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the plan was to wait for it to open</v>

1237
00:50:42.561 --> 00:50:45.980
<v Speaker 1>and sneak out with the crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just jumped out of the beam into the</v>

1238
00:50:45.981 --> 00:50:47.750
<v Speaker 1>crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Disappearance or lift done.</v>

1239
00:50:47.751 --> 00:50:50.300
<v Speaker 1>So when you get caught then what</v>
<v Speaker 1>happens?</v>

1240
00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:53.690
<v Speaker 1>So we've got seen by like a big group of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in,</v>

1241
00:50:53.691 --> 00:50:57.590
<v Speaker 1>in one of the lifts and we just like</v>
<v Speaker 1>waving and they're like,</v>

1242
00:50:57.850 --> 00:51:00.800
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like angry looking people but like angry</v>

1243
00:51:00.801 --> 00:51:02.300
<v Speaker 1>people and happy people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

1244
00:51:02.301 --> 00:51:04.160
<v Speaker 1>what the heck's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

1245
00:51:04.590 --> 00:51:06.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were like above slightly above and</v>

1246
00:51:06.451 --> 00:51:10.490
<v Speaker 1>maintenance platform where they have</v>
<v Speaker 1>like lifts that take workers up.</v>

1247
00:51:10.580 --> 00:51:12.650
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we had to climb down and we met</v>

1248
00:51:12.651 --> 00:51:16.280
<v Speaker 1>people on the maintenance platform</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting the left.</v>

1249
00:51:16.310 --> 00:51:19.010
<v Speaker 1>There's like five of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to me and Stevie and they're like</v>

1250
00:51:19.020 --> 00:51:20.570
<v Speaker 1>few other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Security,</v>

1251
00:51:20.571 --> 00:51:22.520
<v Speaker 1>just like private security for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>tower.</v>

1252
00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:26.100
<v Speaker 1>And then we come down to like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>basement lifts open.</v>

1253
00:51:26.101 --> 00:51:31.101
<v Speaker 1>There's just like a room full of</v>
<v Speaker 1>policemen and we're like go scene in the</v>

1254
00:51:31.521 --> 00:51:34.500
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when they do that bit,</v>

1255
00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:39.050
<v Speaker 1>I had to hide every single way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sd card and everything that I had on me.</v>

1256
00:51:39.410 --> 00:51:40.610

<v Speaker 1>Three counters?</v>

1257
00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:42.170
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1258
00:51:42.170 --> 00:51:44.180
<v Speaker 1>It was an option.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the only option.</v>

1259
00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:47.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't had to do that yet.</v>

1260
00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:49.780

1272
00:52:12.801 --> 00:52:13.910
<v Speaker 1>from the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the big one.</v>

1273
00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:18.800
<v Speaker 1>And I had like this bag that I had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like little tiny pen pockets,</v>

1274
00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:21.050
<v Speaker 1>like really thin pockets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1275
00:52:21.320 --> 00:52:24.640
<v Speaker 1>And I just stuffed the Mike cresty cars</v>
<v Speaker 1>down there and it had like a,</v>

1276
00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:27.770
<v Speaker 1>a little rip in the back padding of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bag.</v>

1277
00:52:27.771 --> 00:52:32.630
<v Speaker 1>So I just threw the CF card in the back</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the bag and it just fell down and I</v>

1278
00:52:32.631 --> 00:52:35.870
<v Speaker 1>just hoped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when like we got to the police</v>

1279
00:52:35.871 --> 00:52:37.640
<v Speaker 1>station,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were like,</v>

1280
00:52:37.670 --> 00:52:41.330
<v Speaker 1>you have so many cameras on you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clearly you've been filming.</v>

1281
00:52:41.330 --> 00:52:42.410
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1282
00:52:43.130 --> 00:52:45.050
<v Speaker 1>I forgot the SD cards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cameras died.</v>

1283
00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:49.280
<v Speaker 1>And they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they believed that I had to surrender</v>

1284
00:52:49.281 --> 00:52:51.800
<v Speaker 1>everything on my phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I um,</v>

1285
00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:53.510
<v Speaker 1>you had to surrender everything on your</v>
<v Speaker 1>phone.</v>

1286
00:52:53.511 --> 00:52:53.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1287
00:52:53.950 --> 00:52:55.400
<v Speaker 1>so I had three cameras,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1288
00:52:55.401 --> 00:52:57.440
<v Speaker 1>So it was like I had three cameras and</v>
<v Speaker 1>my phone.</v>

1289
00:52:57.441 --> 00:53:00.020
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have to give something up</v>

1290
00:53:00.410 --> 00:53:03.650
<v Speaker 1>to try and save the most valuable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most valuable footage.</v>

1291
00:53:04.790 --> 00:53:05.960
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were like,</v>

1292
00:53:05.961 --> 00:53:07.910
<v Speaker 1>did you feel most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I only filmed in my phone because my</v>

1293
00:53:07.911 --> 00:53:11.330
<v Speaker 1>camera's died and I forgot my SD cards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they went through like the</v>

1294
00:53:11.331 --> 00:53:13.330
<v Speaker 1>footage on the phone just made me delete</v>
<v Speaker 1>it or,</v>

1295
00:53:13.610 --> 00:53:14.810
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's cool.</v>

1296
00:53:14.811 --> 00:53:16.550
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the footage and the phone was like a</v>

1297
00:53:16.551 --> 00:53:20.030
<v Speaker 1>ruse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The footage on the phone was like me in</v>

1298
00:53:20.031 --> 00:53:22.340
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the little hole filming,</v>

1299
00:53:22.341 --> 00:53:25.710
<v Speaker 1>talking to the camera and like filming</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people looking cause was like this</v>

1300
00:53:25.711 --> 00:53:26.760
<v Speaker 1>and I put my phone down.</v>

1301
00:53:26.970 --> 00:53:28.830
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That you had something to give them.</v>

1302
00:53:28.890 --> 00:53:30.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1303
00:53:30.210 --> 00:53:32.610
<v Speaker 1>So now then what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long did they detain you?</v>

1304
00:53:32.700 --> 00:53:34.200
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were there for like eight hours.</v>

1305
00:53:34.910 --> 00:53:37.830
<v Speaker 1>So that another eight hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you're eight hours up there</v>

1306
00:53:37.890 --> 00:53:39.130
<v Speaker 1>climbing around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you pee?</v>

1307
00:53:39.500 --> 00:53:42.510
<v Speaker 1>You pee off the edge of the town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

1308
00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:45.960
<v Speaker 1>That's probably where he got arrested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The person on these French people as if</v>

1309
00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:48.360
<v Speaker 1>life wasn't clicked on them enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1310
00:53:48.361 --> 00:53:49.800
<v Speaker 1>I think by the time it gets to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ground,</v>

1311
00:53:49.801 --> 00:53:51.630
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of all spread out and we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

1312
00:53:51.660 --> 00:53:54.660
<v Speaker 1>or it's a fucking raging river of pis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1313
00:53:54.661 --> 00:53:56.700
<v Speaker 1>On some little Old Lady's head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1314
00:53:56.701 --> 00:53:59.820
<v Speaker 1>It seems like if you were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't you just pee on the tower that</v>

1315
00:53:59.821 --> 00:54:02.850
<v Speaker 1>way it dribbles down slowly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't hit anybody in the head.</v>

1316
00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:05.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you were sitting on the Eiffel</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tower and you needed to pay,</v>

1317
00:54:05.530 --> 00:54:08.240
<v Speaker 1>there was no one below you because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 4:00 AM okay.</v>

1318
00:54:08.310 --> 00:54:11.610
<v Speaker 1>You'd pay off the edge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's even ruder.</v>

1319
00:54:12.930 --> 00:54:15.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry enough person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I did pay on them,</v>

1320
00:54:15.420 --> 00:54:17.520
<v Speaker 1>maybe it was a romantic couple going for</v>
<v Speaker 1>a walk,</v>

1321
00:54:17.521 --> 00:54:20.460
<v Speaker 1>maybe it would have really worked out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden the girl goes to lighter</v>

1322
00:54:20.461 --> 00:54:25.170
<v Speaker 1>cigarette and you piss running her head</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she gets mad and the fucking evening</v>

1323
00:54:25.171 --> 00:54:27.480
<v Speaker 1>and poorly and they could have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could have been a perfect</v>

1324
00:54:27.481 --> 00:54:28.680
<v Speaker 1>relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you ruined it.</v>

1325
00:54:28.740 --> 00:54:29.830
<v Speaker 1>I killed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1326
00:54:30.690 --> 00:54:33.540
<v Speaker 1>So you come down and then another eight</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours of detention.</v>

1327
00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:35.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what do they do to you?</v>

1328
00:54:35.430 --> 00:54:38.220
<v Speaker 1>Handcuffed us to a chair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just sat in the middle of the,</v>

1329
00:54:38.510 --> 00:54:42.330
<v Speaker 1>of this police station.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like sales behind us with people</v>

1330
00:54:42.331 --> 00:54:47.331
<v Speaker 1>going crazy and like people bleeding</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the eyeballs and we just sat there</v>

1331
00:54:47.371 --> 00:54:50.000
<v Speaker 1>like people bleeding from the rivals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from other crimes,</v>

1332
00:54:50.530 --> 00:54:53.430
<v Speaker 1>nighttime fights and stuff like that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>just drunk people.</v>

1333
00:54:53.430 --> 00:54:58.110
<v Speaker 1>And we just sat there for ages and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>we finally got taken into separate rooms</v>

1334
00:54:58.111 --> 00:55:00.240
<v Speaker 1>where we were questioned by some high</v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

1335
00:55:00.830 --> 00:55:03.780
<v Speaker 1>I had a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had a dude and we were both</v>

1336
00:55:03.781 --> 00:55:07.740
<v Speaker 1>questioned for a couple hours and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were back out handcuffed to the</v>

1337
00:55:07.741 --> 00:55:10.440
<v Speaker 1>chairs again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they took all of our stuff and</v>

1338
00:55:10.441 --> 00:55:12.140
<v Speaker 1>they searched it and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1339
00:55:12.180 --> 00:55:14.880
<v Speaker 1>if they find it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be like,</v>

1340
00:55:14.940 --> 00:55:16.890
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just told us that you feel nothing.</v>

1341
00:55:17.100 --> 00:55:19.320
<v Speaker 1>And we've just found hours and hours of</v>
<v Speaker 1>footage,</v>

1342
00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:22.440
<v Speaker 1>like what's the deal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>

1343
00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:24.590
<v Speaker 1>oh please.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cods.</v>

1344
00:55:24.770 --> 00:55:26.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

1345
00:55:26.131 --> 00:55:27.510
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they finally brought the,</v>

1346
00:55:27.690 --> 00:55:29.460
<v Speaker 1>brought the bags back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it must've been an hour.</v>

1347
00:55:29.461 --> 00:55:32.280
<v Speaker 1>They had them full and I thought they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were going to go through everything,</v>

1348
00:55:32.281 --> 00:55:34.800
<v Speaker 1>but they brought it back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I checked it and I was like,</v>

1349
00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:37.930
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] the gods are still here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then we just like,</v>

1350
00:55:38.310 --> 00:55:39.690
<v Speaker 1>we just lost it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were so happy.</v>

1351
00:55:39.691 --> 00:55:41.210
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the policemen,</v>

1352
00:55:41.350 --> 00:55:45.330
<v Speaker 1>I had no idea what we were doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So did they kick you out of the country?</v>

1353
00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:46.641
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Record.</v>

1354
00:55:46.641 --> 00:55:49.680
<v Speaker 1>And I said nothing at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I had to go back to that room.</v>

1355
00:55:49.700 --> 00:55:54.690
<v Speaker 1>I had to sign an agreement that said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I promise I will not climb the Eiffel</v>

1356
00:55:54.690 --> 00:55:56.670
<v Speaker 1>Tower for three years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For three years.</v>

1357
00:55:56.671 --> 00:55:57.720
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was it.</v>

1358
00:55:57.721 --> 00:55:58.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait a bad them.</v>

1359
00:55:58.801 --> 00:56:00.930
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How come they only give you,</v>

1360
00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:02.730
<v Speaker 1>how can we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll take forever.</v>

1361
00:56:05.310 --> 00:56:06.840
<v Speaker 1>They must like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1362
00:56:06.920 --> 00:56:08.440
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interviewing me,</v>

1363
00:56:08.520 --> 00:56:09.930
<v Speaker 1>he loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She did.</v>

1364
00:56:09.931 --> 00:56:12.480
<v Speaker 1>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really shouldn't be doing this,</v>

1365
00:56:12.481 --> 00:56:15.180
<v Speaker 1>but how did you do this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's incredible.</v>

1366
00:56:15.210 --> 00:56:16.940
<v Speaker 1>Like she loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why Oak?</v>

1367
00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:17.760
<v Speaker 1>He loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1368
00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:19.410
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think once they realize that you're</v>

1369
00:56:19.411 --> 00:56:20.730
<v Speaker 1>polite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a gentlemen,</v>

1370
00:56:20.731 --> 00:56:23.120
<v Speaker 1>you're a very nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just a thrill seeker.</v>

1371
00:56:23.121 --> 00:56:23.640
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1372
00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:25.570
<v Speaker 1>this is not a threat to society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1373
00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:27.470
<v Speaker 1>Sky's in a terrorist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1374
00:56:27.490 --> 00:56:30.580
<v Speaker 1>So the second question she asked me was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you leave a bomb up there?</v>

1375
00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:32.230
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I just laughed.</v>

1376
00:56:32.231 --> 00:56:33.064
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

1377
00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:34.930
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

1378
00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:36.520
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's something they have to take any</v>

1379
00:56:36.521 --> 00:56:38.080
<v Speaker 1>consideration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have to actually trust you.</v>

1380
00:56:38.081 --> 00:56:40.300
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they let you go and turns out you did</v>

1381
00:56:40.301 --> 00:56:43.060
<v Speaker 1>leave a bottom up down [inaudible] then</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to like,</v>

1382
00:56:43.090 --> 00:56:45.950
<v Speaker 1>they would have to comb over the</v>
<v Speaker 1>building with a fine tooth comb and you</v>

1383
00:56:45.951 --> 00:56:47.500
<v Speaker 1>just say he's going to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1384
00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:49.930
<v Speaker 1>you know what I did?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I left the bulb up there.</v>

1385
00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:51.210
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one would write.</v>

1386
00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:53.730
<v Speaker 1>So they really have to trust you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1387
00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:56.560
<v Speaker 1>Fucking Europeans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ridiculous,</v>

1388
00:56:57.640 --> 00:56:59.470

00:57:05.970 --> 00:57:08.030
<v Speaker 1>They throw dogs in there with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

1392
00:57:09.360 --> 00:57:13.150
<v Speaker 1>It just seems like um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're a little bit looser over there.</v>

1393
00:57:13.210 --> 00:57:15.000
<v Speaker 1>A little more relaxed about things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1394
00:57:15.820 --> 00:57:20.820
<v Speaker 1>I was under,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was driving from La to San Fran a</v>

1395
00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:25.240
<v Speaker 1>couple of weeks ago up the one is it the</v>
<v Speaker 1>one amazing drive and I find like a</v>

1396
00:57:25.241 --> 00:57:27.450
<v Speaker 1>couple of cranes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went and saw like some elephants,</v>

1397
00:57:27.451 --> 00:57:31.960
<v Speaker 1>the elephant seals and then shortly</v>
<v Speaker 1>after that I just found like a building</v>

1398
00:57:31.961 --> 00:57:33.340
<v Speaker 1>site on the site,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like near the beach,</v>

1399
00:57:33.370 --> 00:57:35.290
<v Speaker 1>like a hundred meters back from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>beach.</v>

1400
00:57:35.400 --> 00:57:36.700
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course I need to stop.</v>

1401
00:57:36.970 --> 00:57:38.470
<v Speaker 1>And just do this because it's dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

1402
00:57:38.471 --> 00:57:39.670
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we can,</v>

1403
00:57:39.671 --> 00:57:41.800
<v Speaker 1>was it a holiday weekend?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1404
00:57:42.130 --> 00:57:45.550
<v Speaker 1>So I did it and I stopped and I climbed</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and then I'm at the top and I looked</v>

1405
00:57:45.551 --> 00:57:48.100
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I had like a rental Mustang and I</v>

1406
00:57:48.101 --> 00:57:51.010
<v Speaker 1>popped the Mustang in the site,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like on the top of this peak,</v>

1407
00:57:51.011 --> 00:57:53.620
<v Speaker 1>it looked really cool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you could see it from the road.</v>

1408
00:57:53.890 --> 00:57:55.450
<v Speaker 1>So a cop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cops driving past,</v>

1409
00:57:55.540 --> 00:57:56.590
<v Speaker 1>he sees the Mustang.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

1410
00:57:56.591 --> 00:57:59.260
<v Speaker 1>what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he pulls in and he's walking around</v>

1411
00:57:59.570 --> 00:58:02.260
<v Speaker 1>looking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you looked up and he sees me at</v>

1412
00:58:02.261 --> 00:58:06.040
<v Speaker 1>the top of this crane and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get your ass down here right now.</v>

1413
00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:07.210
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

1417
00:58:12.791 --> 00:58:14.410

00:58:14.830 --> 00:58:15.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1431
00:58:40.001 --> 00:58:41.960
<v Speaker 1>I've got this all on video as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He shouts at me,</v>

1432
00:58:41.961 --> 00:58:44.800
<v Speaker 1>I come down and then he just lays into</v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

1433
00:58:45.590 --> 00:58:47.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Asking me from England,</v>

1434
00:58:47.531 --> 00:58:49.030
<v Speaker 1>you don't know any better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1435
00:58:49.031 --> 00:58:49.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

1436
00:58:49.540 --> 00:58:50.810
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in England it's nicely.</v>

1437
00:58:51.790 --> 00:58:52.650
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not an,</v>

1438
00:58:52.790 --> 00:58:54.940
<v Speaker 1>you're in the United States of America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>

1439
00:58:55.180 --> 00:58:58.900
<v Speaker 1>and you need to do what you should do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>

1440
00:58:59.290 --> 00:59:01.060
<v Speaker 1>So he doesn't want to fill out the</v>
<v Speaker 1>paperwork.</v>

1441
00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:05.670
<v Speaker 1>It took my driver's license.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He checked all my stuff and then he,</v>

1442
00:59:05.720 --> 00:59:06.491
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1443
00:59:06.491 --> 00:59:08.170
<v Speaker 1>He came back after like 10 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

1444
00:59:08.171 --> 00:59:10.570
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I made a decision and I'm going to</v>

1445
00:59:10.571 --> 00:59:13.120
<v Speaker 1>leave this in the hands of the site</v>
<v Speaker 1>manager.</v>

1446
00:59:13.570 --> 00:59:15.640
<v Speaker 1>So he goes and he tries to find a site</v>
<v Speaker 1>manager,</v>

1447
00:59:15.641 --> 00:59:16.600
<v Speaker 1>but it's a holiday weekend.</v>

1448
00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:18.760
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he goes to the office,</v>

1449
00:59:18.761 --> 00:59:22.700
<v Speaker 1>he phones up some number on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the door and he speaks to the site</v>

1450
00:59:22.701 --> 00:59:26.390
<v Speaker 1>manager and the site managers just got</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to La from,</v>

1451
00:59:26.540 --> 00:59:29.120
<v Speaker 1>from where he's working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>

1452
00:59:29.121 --> 00:59:30.410
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've just got back home.</v>

1453
00:59:30.411 --> 00:59:33.010
<v Speaker 1>I cannot be bothered to deal with this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So just,</v>

1454
00:59:33.011 --> 00:59:35.330
<v Speaker 1>just let him go and then we just go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was it.</v>

1455
00:59:36.290 --> 00:59:38.330
<v Speaker 1>What is the worst you've ever gotten in</v>
<v Speaker 1>trouble?</v>

1456
00:59:38.720 --> 00:59:42.920
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing,</v>

1457
00:59:42.921 --> 00:59:43.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

1458
00:59:43.970 --> 00:59:46.820
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing like bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you worried now though there with</v>

1459
00:59:46.821 --> 00:59:50.000
<v Speaker 1>your Internet fame that now you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting millions of hits in these videos</v>

1460
00:59:50.001 --> 00:59:52.490
<v Speaker 1>that people are gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're gonna recognize you and maybe</v>

1461
00:59:52.491 --> 00:59:56.180
<v Speaker 1>even like a target you yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Set an example.</v>

1462
00:59:56.210 --> 00:59:58.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1463
00:59:58.730 --> 01:00:01.200
<v Speaker 1>I've thought about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't seem to happen.</v>

1464
01:00:01.330 --> 01:00:03.800
<v Speaker 1>Happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems to be getting easier because</v>

1465
01:00:03.801 --> 01:00:06.150
<v Speaker 1>that all shit Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy like can I take a picture of</v>

1466
01:00:06.151 --> 01:00:06.270
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

1467
01:00:06.270 --> 01:00:10.010
<v Speaker 1>That's just how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you worry that you're encouraging</v>

1468
01:00:10.011 --> 01:00:13.580
<v Speaker 1>people that are not as competent or</v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughtful as you?</v>

1469
01:00:13.820 --> 01:00:18.050
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm worried that somebody that is a bit</v>

1470
01:00:18.051 --> 01:00:19.940
<v Speaker 1>silly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might see it and think,</v>

1471
01:00:19.970 --> 01:00:20.920
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to do this to,</v>

1472
01:00:21.050 --> 01:00:23.480
<v Speaker 1>to be cool or to look cool in front of</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mates.</v>

1473
01:00:23.510 --> 01:00:24.830
<v Speaker 1>Like young kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1474
01:00:25.250 --> 01:00:26.330
<v Speaker 1>The allegory about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1475
01:00:26.331 --> 01:00:28.860
<v Speaker 1>but there's not much I can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's,</v>

1476
01:00:28.910 --> 01:00:32.690
<v Speaker 1>there's so many more things out there</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are so easily available on the</v>

1477
01:00:32.691 --> 01:00:35.720
<v Speaker 1>Internet that kids could watch and be</v>
<v Speaker 1>inspired by.</v>

1478
01:00:35.730 --> 01:00:38.660
<v Speaker 1>And like I'd just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always make it clear that what I'm</v>

1479
01:00:38.661 --> 01:00:40.220
<v Speaker 1>doing is just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1480
01:00:40.230 --> 01:00:44.030
<v Speaker 1>I want people to get from this is like</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going out exploring the world,</v>

1481
01:00:44.031 --> 01:00:47.990
<v Speaker 1>live in my life in a way that I enjoy</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing things that make me happy,</v>

1482
01:00:48.630 --> 01:00:50.090
<v Speaker 1>pushing myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>developing myself,</v>

1483
01:00:50.091 --> 01:00:51.980
<v Speaker 1>becoming a better person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a stronger person.</v>

1484
01:00:52.370 --> 01:00:54.880
<v Speaker 1>And that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And climbing and jumping around.</v>

1485
01:00:54.890 --> 01:00:57.020
<v Speaker 1>It's just my way of doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we all have our own little</v>

1486
01:00:57.021 --> 01:00:57.854
<v Speaker 1>passions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1487
01:00:58.130 --> 01:01:00.740
<v Speaker 1>That's just mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yours might be badminton or like</v>

1488
01:01:01.130 --> 01:01:04.190
<v Speaker 1>something Ping Pong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another thing that's interesting</v>

1489
01:01:04.191 --> 01:01:09.191
<v Speaker 1>that's happening now with the larger</v>
<v Speaker 1>number of content providers,</v>

1490
01:01:09.291 --> 01:01:11.180
<v Speaker 1>like so many people like yourself that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are doing things like this.</v>

1491
01:01:11.190 --> 01:01:14.960
<v Speaker 1>The idea that one person is responsible</v>
<v Speaker 1>for their influence becomes less and</v>

1492
01:01:14.961 --> 01:01:17.600
<v Speaker 1>less plausible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just comes more like,</v>

1493
01:01:17.601 --> 01:01:18.920
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is he representing?</v>

1494
01:01:18.921 --> 01:01:20.840
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's representing a 26 year old guy who</v>

1495
01:01:20.841 --> 01:01:23.000
<v Speaker 1>absolutely knows how to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1496
01:01:23.001 --> 01:01:25.550
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to do what he's doing,</v>

1497
01:01:25.551 --> 01:01:29.060
<v Speaker 1>but he can do what he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So are you supposed to stop doing what</v>

1498
01:01:29.061 --> 01:01:30.960
<v Speaker 1>you're doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which you obviously very case actually,</v>

1499
01:01:31.490 --> 01:01:35.720
<v Speaker 1>because you're not a good example with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're the perfect example of someone</v>

1500
01:01:35.721 --> 01:01:36.680
<v Speaker 1>doing it correctly.</v>

1501
01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:37.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1502
01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:40.430
<v Speaker 1>But that people just don't just don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>get that well.</v>

1503
01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:42.830
<v Speaker 1>The idea that you're influencing people</v>
<v Speaker 1>is always,</v>

1504
01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:45.410
<v Speaker 1>it's always very tricky because we'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>please supposed to do,</v>

1505
01:01:45.411 --> 01:01:48.680
<v Speaker 1>he's supposed to live your life in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>cushion room so no one gets injured</v>

1506
01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:51.620
<v Speaker 1>because that's the only way to influence</v>
<v Speaker 1>people positively.</v>

1507
01:01:51.660 --> 01:01:53.360
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In terms of like if you're going to do</v>

1508
01:01:53.361 --> 01:01:57.650
<v Speaker 1>risky things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could always be an example or be an</v>

1509
01:01:57.690 --> 01:02:00.020
<v Speaker 1>inspiration to someone who's not as</v>
<v Speaker 1>competent as you.</v>

1510
01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:00.741
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm naked.</v>

1511
01:02:00.741 --> 01:02:01.790
<v Speaker 1>Risk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>death or injury.</v>

1512
01:02:02.150 --> 01:02:03.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think,</v>

1513
01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:08.060
<v Speaker 1>honestly I don't think anybody is stupid</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to see it go out and try it.</v>

1514
01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:10.520
<v Speaker 1>Like most people on Earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1515
01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:13.280
<v Speaker 1>Can put them up a crane and they'll shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

1516
01:02:13.281 --> 01:02:15.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think any 12 year old,</v>

1517
01:02:15.351 --> 01:02:17.270
<v Speaker 1>14 year old kid is going to say it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>be like,</v>

1518
01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:18.550
<v Speaker 1>oh dude to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the climate.</v>

1519
01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:19.351
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And off it.</v>

1520
01:02:19.351 --> 01:02:20.730
<v Speaker 1>I just don't see that happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1521
01:02:20.731 --> 01:02:22.770
<v Speaker 1>they're definitely gonna do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I disagree.</v>

1522
01:02:22.890 --> 01:02:24.600
<v Speaker 1>There's going to be a bunch of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1523
01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:26.730
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of crazy fucks out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like you pal.</v>

1524
01:02:27.420 --> 01:02:28.253

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1528
01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:37.753
<v Speaker 1>As far as I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1529
01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:39.840

<v Speaker 1>This guy's out of his fucking mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's doing like flips and he's doing</v>

1547
01:03:25.561 --> 01:03:28.140
<v Speaker 1>chin ups and he's letting go of his</v>
<v Speaker 1>hands.</v>

1548
01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:29.970
<v Speaker 1>He's doing chin ups and he gets to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>top.</v>

1549
01:03:29.971 --> 01:03:32.130
<v Speaker 1>He lets go of his hands and he's doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>several of them.</v>

1550
01:03:32.310 --> 01:03:37.130
<v Speaker 1>He's doing one leg with one leg crossed</v>
<v Speaker 1>over the other one kind of winded.</v>

<v Speaker 1>This is driving me nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you see like there's a bunch of</v>

1554
01:03:47.071 --> 01:03:49.780
<v Speaker 1>videos of dudes in this place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

01:03:49.781 --> 01:03:51.390
<v Speaker 1>Well how many people have died from this</v>
<v Speaker 1>place?</v>

1556
01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:55.850
<v Speaker 1>It must be a few.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

1557
01:03:55.851 --> 01:03:59.120
<v Speaker 1>Look at this guy gripping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

01:04:04.100 --> 01:04:04.780
<v Speaker 1>This is so sad,</v>

1560
01:04:04.780 --> 01:04:06.070
<v Speaker 5>Gary.</v>
<v Speaker 5>As a watch.</v>

1561
01:04:06.790 --> 01:04:09.400
<v Speaker 5>This video isn't that old.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you think this may be started once</v>

1562
01:04:09.401 --> 01:04:10.330
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sorry,</v>

1563
01:04:10.331 --> 01:04:12.850
<v Speaker 5>once cameras became the portable enough</v>
<v Speaker 5>to get up there,</v>

1564
01:04:12.851 --> 01:04:15.090
<v Speaker 5>like the small little flip cams and</v>
<v Speaker 5>blogging cam.</v>

1565
01:04:15.100 --> 01:04:16.330
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe it wasn't,</v>

1566
01:04:16.510 --> 01:04:20.680
<v Speaker 5>you weren't capable of taking a big ass</v>
<v Speaker 5>vcr camera like you got a drone in one</v>

1567
01:04:20.681 --> 01:04:22.870
<v Speaker 5>of yours.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I saw them and drones are being able to</v>

1568
01:04:22.871 --> 01:04:24.820
<v Speaker 5>do live video now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look at my hands.</v>

1569
01:04:25.090 --> 01:04:25.810
<v Speaker 5>He could,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I could.</v>

1570
01:04:25.810 --> 01:04:28.350
<v Speaker 5>I could like ring the out in a glass</v>

1571
01:04:28.950 --> 01:04:31.410
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm watching this video and I'm freaking</v>

1572
01:04:31.411 --> 01:04:33.390
<v Speaker 1>out and these guys are doing it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're laughing.</v>

1573
01:04:33.710 --> 01:04:35.970
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're so high up.</v>

1574
01:04:36.210 --> 01:04:37.950
<v Speaker 1>Look at that forest below them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1575
01:04:39.510 --> 01:04:41.160
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're right that people have</v>

1576
01:04:41.161 --> 01:04:42.600
<v Speaker 1>always probably done this.</v>

1577
01:04:42.990 --> 01:04:43.823
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1578
01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:47.260
<v Speaker 1>Amazing feats of athleticism too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at this guy bouncing in his</v>

1579
01:04:47.261 --> 01:04:48.560
<v Speaker 1>hands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his feet up boxes,</v>

1580
01:04:49.300 --> 01:04:52.030
<v Speaker 1>full plank hanging off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at this guy.</v>

1581
01:04:52.031 --> 01:04:54.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's some serious fucking strength.</v>

1582
01:04:56.330 --> 01:04:56.920
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1583
01:04:56.920 --> 01:05:01.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's such a crazy endeavor.</v>

1584
01:05:02.270 --> 01:05:05.410
<v Speaker 5>Where are you doing some of this before</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could film it like before you even</v>

1585
01:05:05.411 --> 01:05:08.170
<v Speaker 5>had a camera.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's not just about showing people.</v>

1586
01:05:08.770 --> 01:05:10.510
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you know anybody who's fallen and</v>

1587
01:05:10.511 --> 01:05:11.290
<v Speaker 5>died?</v>

1588
01:05:11.290 --> 01:05:14.410
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1589
01:05:14.411 --> 01:05:15.420
<v Speaker 1>None personally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1590
01:05:15.421 --> 01:05:17.620
<v Speaker 1>there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a park old guy that fell off a</v>

1591
01:05:17.621 --> 01:05:18.880
<v Speaker 1>rooftop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was doing a back.</v>

1592
01:05:18.881 --> 01:05:20.800
<v Speaker 1>Some are still on the edge of a rooftop</v>
<v Speaker 1>from you,</v>

1593
01:05:20.801 --> 01:05:24.370
<v Speaker 1>like a wool like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like an easy thing to do,</v>

1594
01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:28.360
<v Speaker 1>but something must've got to him and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>fell off and he died.</v>

1595
01:05:29.220 --> 01:05:31.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>16 stories,</v>

1596
01:05:31.001 --> 01:05:31.840
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Woo.</v>

1597
01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:35.560
<v Speaker 1>This is recent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Couple of years ago,</v>

1598
01:05:35.561 --> 01:05:36.640
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where do you fall?</v>

1599
01:05:37.460 --> 01:05:39.250
<v Speaker 1>What place?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1600
01:05:39.251 --> 01:05:40.990
<v Speaker 1>I think it was Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty sure it was rush.</v>

1601
01:05:41.030 --> 01:05:42.130
<v Speaker 1>You Google it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll find it.</v>

1602
01:05:42.340 --> 01:05:45.070
<v Speaker 1>So it's surprisingly few deaths.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1603
01:05:45.180 --> 01:05:47.170
<v Speaker 1>That we know about the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a publicized,</v>

1604
01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:48.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't see that many.</v>

1605
01:05:51.170 --> 01:05:52.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is good.</v>

1606
01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:53.870
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1607
01:05:53.900 --> 01:05:56.390
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're planning a lot of leads me to</v>

1608
01:05:56.391 --> 01:05:59.990
<v Speaker 1>believe that people aren't stupid enough</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go out and mess up.</v>

1609
01:06:00.350 --> 01:06:03.470
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's such a scary thing to do that it</v>

1610
01:06:03.471 --> 01:06:05.990
<v Speaker 1>just takes a very small percentage of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1611
01:06:06.170 --> 01:06:07.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1612
01:06:07.130 --> 01:06:09.320
<v Speaker 1>and it grabs a hold of them and says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to do this too.</v>

1613
01:06:09.380 --> 01:06:11.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a video that's actually on</v>

1614
01:06:11.751 --> 01:06:13.820
<v Speaker 1>youtube that probably shouldn't be on</v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Have somebody fill me from the ground up</v>
<v Speaker 1>at a crane and a guy like walks across</v>

1616
01:06:19.731 --> 01:06:22.520
<v Speaker 1>the top beam of the crane and falls and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd just see his body just,</v>

1675
01:08:30.831 --> 01:08:32.870

<v Speaker 1>turbo,</v>

1676
01:08:32.871 --> 01:08:33.860
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You like it</v>

1677
01:08:35.730 --> 01:08:39.230
<v Speaker 1>like it's a completely different sound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I like it.</v>

1678
01:08:39.260 --> 01:08:43.220
<v Speaker 1>I used to have like a turbo charged car</v>
<v Speaker 1>before the va m three and I missed all</v>

1679
01:08:43.221 --> 01:08:45.740
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the little hisses and the wobbles and I</v>

1680
01:08:45.741 --> 01:08:47.120
<v Speaker 1>missed it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now I've got it back.</v>

1681
01:08:47.420 --> 01:08:50.720
<v Speaker 1>That's stuff much faster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people like the roar of the v</v>

1682
01:08:50.721 --> 01:08:53.360
<v Speaker 1>eight yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the big complaint about the m three</v>

1683
01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:56.690
<v Speaker 1>m four rather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't have that roar and it</v>

1684
01:08:56.691 --> 01:08:57.740
<v Speaker 1>doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's completely different,</v>

1685
01:08:57.741 --> 01:08:59.240
<v Speaker 1>but I wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't compare them.</v>

1686
01:08:59.241 --> 01:09:00.620
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say all the m three is</v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

1687
01:09:00.621 --> 01:09:02.090
<v Speaker 1>It's just a different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a different breed,</v>

1688
01:09:02.091 --> 01:09:02.840
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1689
01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:04.310
<v Speaker 1>well we're getting used to cars that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>make.</v>

1690
01:09:05.180 --> 01:09:08.030
<v Speaker 1>Those electric cars are becoming more</v>
<v Speaker 1>and more prevalent.</v>

1691
01:09:08.420 --> 01:09:10.250
<v Speaker 1>I saw that the Tesla numbers the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>

<v Speaker 1>like the software update,</v>

1698
01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:29.440
<v Speaker 1>like a foam or update at speed to your</v>

1708
01:09:44.871 --> 01:09:47.450
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does this zero to 60 in 2.5 seconds</v>

1711
01:10:01.670 --> 01:10:03.410
<v Speaker 1>What does it say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it a different one</v>

1712
01:10:05.020 --> 01:10:07.370
<v Speaker 1>and model two?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They make that sweet one,</v>

1713
01:10:07.550 --> 01:10:09.380
<v Speaker 1>that little tiny one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do they still,</v>

1714

<v Speaker 1>there's Tesla's still make that little</v>
<v Speaker 1>sports car one.</v>

1715
01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:12.913
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't,</v>

1716
01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:14.960
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they released them in limited numbers.</v>

1717
01:10:15.350 --> 01:10:18.010
<v Speaker 1>The little tiny one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The little little lotus look at him.</v>

1718
01:10:18.260 --> 01:10:18.761
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1719
01:10:18.761 --> 01:10:22.490
<v Speaker 1>That Lotus looking one was beautiful</v>
<v Speaker 1>that first wasn't it?</v>

1720
01:10:22.550 --> 01:10:25.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it is on skinny tires and apparently</v>

1721
01:10:25.851 --> 01:10:28.640
<v Speaker 1>the weights all fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like Porsche nine 11,</v>

1722
01:10:28.641 --> 01:10:30.560
<v Speaker 1>but way to the extreme cause all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>weights in the back.</v>

1723
01:10:30.590 --> 01:10:31.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like a Porsche,</v>

1724
01:10:31.671 --> 01:10:33.080
<v Speaker 1>but way more weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1725
01:10:33.140 --> 01:10:35.960
<v Speaker 1>So it's like if you go around a corner</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the asset and kicks out on you,</v>

1726
01:10:35.961 --> 01:10:38.420
<v Speaker 1>you just won't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or if you're going around a corner and</v>

1727
01:10:38.421 --> 01:10:40.850
<v Speaker 1>you're hitting the gas and you let off</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gas,</v>

1728
01:10:40.910 --> 01:10:41.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get that,</v>

<v Speaker 1>calculation that's involved and creating</v>

1759
01:12:04.201 --> 01:12:06.900
<v Speaker 1>something that's so capable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1814
01:14:30.251 --> 01:14:32.980
<v Speaker 1>the guy lived,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not negative,</v>

1815
01:14:33.250 --> 01:14:33.900
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

01:14:53.890 --> 01:14:57.490
<v Speaker 1>Like you build your hands up so that you</v>

01:15:20.710 --> 01:15:23.380
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your legs take as much of the impact as</v>

1836
01:15:23.381 --> 01:15:26.530
<v Speaker 1>they physically can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you smash your bum until the</v>

1837
01:15:26.531 --> 01:15:27.910
<v Speaker 1>ground and then you just do it</v>
<v Speaker 1>backwards.</v>

1838
01:15:27.911 --> 01:15:28.690
<v Speaker 1>Roll.</v>

<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1843
01:15:40.301 --> 01:15:43.300
<v Speaker 1>He did a back flip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like somebody gave him something like a</v>

1844
01:15:43.301 --> 01:15:44.890
<v Speaker 1>dollar or something crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1845
01:15:44.950 --> 01:15:48.370
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't it like 20 bucks or something</v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous with this dude?</v>

1846
01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:49.510
<v Speaker 1>Like he's standing there.</v>

1847
01:15:50.750 --> 01:15:51.480
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

1848
01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:55.680
<v Speaker 1>And this is no one had to</v>
<v Speaker 1>please don't hurt yourself.</v>

1849
01:15:55.681 --> 01:16:00.681
<v Speaker 1>Please look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going gonna say a prayer.</v>

1850
01:16:02.760 --> 01:16:03.800
<v Speaker 1>You hear that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm ready.</v>

1851
01:16:05.330 --> 01:16:06.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't even want to look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

1852
01:16:06.611 --> 01:16:08.120
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to turn away either</v>
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>

1853
01:16:08.121 --> 01:16:11.900
<v Speaker 1>are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to be there.</v>

1854
01:16:12.020 --> 01:16:14.390
<v Speaker 1>So this guy is standing there with his</v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

1855
01:16:14.660 --> 01:16:16.670
<v Speaker 1>He's building height right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here it goes.</v>

1856
01:16:18.950 --> 01:16:21.050
<v Speaker 6>Smash.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And he made it.</v>

1857
01:16:25.650 --> 01:16:27.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm good bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm good.</v>

1858
01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:36.480
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got strong bones would be snapped.</v>

1859
01:16:36.750 --> 01:16:37.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is.</v>

1860
01:16:37.741 --> 01:16:39.650
<v Speaker 1>And that was a hard surface he fell</v>
<v Speaker 1>onto.</v>

1861
01:16:39.980 --> 01:16:41.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would just think that if someone</v>

1862
01:16:41.491 --> 01:16:42.690
<v Speaker 1>just jumped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1863
01:16:42.691 --> 01:16:46.410
<v Speaker 1>is the flip helping at all?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does how's that?</v>

1864
01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:49.440
<v Speaker 1>Just because of the momentum is it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going this way instead of just going to</v>

1865
01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:50.790
<v Speaker 1>slam straight down.</v>

1866
01:16:52.190 --> 01:16:54.290
<v Speaker 1>I think it makes sense some of that into</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1867
01:16:54.291 --> 01:16:55.250
<v Speaker 1>which is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1868
01:16:55.251 --> 01:16:58.070
<v Speaker 1>when you see people jumping massive roof</v>
<v Speaker 1>gaps and they laugh and they roll,</v>

1869
01:16:58.430 --> 01:17:02.390
<v Speaker 1>that's converting all this downwards</v>
<v Speaker 1>momentum into a forward and to Ford.</v>

1870
01:17:02.391 --> 01:17:04.490
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that means you can jump a lot further</v>

1871
01:17:04.491 --> 01:17:05.360
<v Speaker 1>than you think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1872
01:17:05.361 --> 01:17:06.590
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1873
01:17:06.620 --> 01:17:09.080
<v Speaker 1>but how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have to drop straight,</v>

1874
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:11.180
<v Speaker 1>what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>

1875
01:17:11.181 --> 01:17:14.060
<v Speaker 1>you lied and you just slam your hands</v>
<v Speaker 1>until the ground as well.</v>

1876
01:17:14.090 --> 01:17:16.130
<v Speaker 1>Spread out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The impact is as best you can.</v>

1877
01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:18.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It rolls are any good,</v>

1878
01:17:18.291 --> 01:17:19.730
<v Speaker 1>really a feel going forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quite a lot.</v>

1879
01:17:20.150 --> 01:17:22.880
<v Speaker 1>So running.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you had to jump off of that 40</v>

1880
01:17:22.881 --> 01:17:24.830
<v Speaker 1>foot high wall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy was on,</v>

1881
01:17:24.831 --> 01:17:26.070
<v Speaker 1>how would you jump?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1882
01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:27.770
<v Speaker 1>I'd probably hang off the edge and just</v>
<v Speaker 1>straight drop.</v>

1883
01:17:27.950 --> 01:17:29.870
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1884
01:17:29.890 --> 01:17:32.270
<v Speaker 1>It's not one that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not that high at the fuck.</v>

1885
01:17:32.270 --> 01:17:36.590
<v Speaker 1>Are you saying you don't think you'd</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a problem making that jump?</v>

1886
01:17:36.770 --> 01:17:38.270
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1887
01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:40.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done big drops.</v>

1888
01:17:40.990 --> 01:17:42.170
<v Speaker 1>It helps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm big as well.</v>

1889
01:17:42.171 --> 01:17:45.080
<v Speaker 1>So does it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but makes it your heavy too,</v>

1890
01:17:45.081 --> 01:17:46.130
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1891
01:17:46.131 --> 01:17:47.430
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my legs a lot.</v>

1892
01:17:47.570 --> 01:17:48.620
<v Speaker 1>I've got good legs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1893
01:17:48.750 --> 01:17:52.640
<v Speaker 1>My legs like my strongest thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you exercise or do you just do a lot</v>

1894
01:17:52.641 --> 01:17:54.590
<v Speaker 1>of that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just the exercise comes from doing it</v>

1895
01:17:54.591 --> 01:17:56.870
<v Speaker 1>and that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how often do you do it now?</v>

1896
01:17:56.871 --> 01:17:58.400
<v Speaker 1>Not so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to do a lot,</v>

1897
01:17:58.401 --> 01:18:01.400
<v Speaker 1>like I used to go out every day and</v>
<v Speaker 1>train all day and just repeat jumps and</v>

1898
01:18:01.940 --> 01:18:03.770
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's kind of like bill in me,</v>

1899
01:18:04.130 --> 01:18:05.600
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a problem.</v>

1900
01:18:05.601 --> 01:18:08.750
<v Speaker 1>Like as the more famous you get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more obligations you get,</v>

1901
01:18:08.751 --> 01:18:12.500
<v Speaker 1>the less time you have to practice and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more people expect of you do crazier</v>

1902
01:18:12.501 --> 01:18:13.334
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

1903
01:18:13.490 --> 01:18:14.301
<v Speaker 1>It's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1904
01:18:14.301 --> 01:18:16.340
<v Speaker 1>But fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1905
01:18:17.350 --> 01:18:18.860
<v Speaker 1>don't die dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You seem like a nice guy.</v>

1906
01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:20.540
<v Speaker 1>No it die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Please don't.</v>

1907
01:18:20.780 --> 01:18:22.520
<v Speaker 1>That'd be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be a wonderful story if you made it</v>

1908
01:18:22.521 --> 01:18:23.400
<v Speaker 1>through this thing.</v>
