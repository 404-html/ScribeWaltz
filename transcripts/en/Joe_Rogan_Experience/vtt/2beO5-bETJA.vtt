151
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.320
<v Speaker 1>I did assured that you watched a grown man Jack off bus near you.</v>

152
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:09.220
<v Speaker 1>Not on your face.</v>

153
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:10.600

<v Speaker 1>Know what man?</v>

155
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.030
<v Speaker 1>When you were 11 years old.</v>

156
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.330
<v Speaker 1>Weird Shit can happen to you to this 11 year old hockey.</v>

157
00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:17.200

<v Speaker 1>You got lucky.</v>

159
00:03:17.891 --> 00:03:19.330
<v Speaker 1>But I'm not saying that would have happened.</v>

160
00:03:19.331 --> 00:03:20.860
<v Speaker 1>You would've stood around with a guy jerked off.</v>

161
00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.410
<v Speaker 1>But I am saying it's possible that a guy,</v>

162
00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:24.371
<v Speaker 1>when you were 11,</v>

163
00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:25.600
<v Speaker 1>could've lied down and say,</v>

164
00:03:25.601 --> 00:03:25.871
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

165

00:03:28.001 --> 00:03:28.870

168
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:29.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

169
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.900
<v Speaker 1>It's good to have fatty foods is fun.</v>

170
00:03:31.901 --> 00:03:33.040
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it's not.</v>

171
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.581
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

172
00:03:33.581 --> 00:03:38.581
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe it's good to miss out on all the pleasures in life because some</v>

173
00:03:38.651 --> 00:03:39.610
<v Speaker 1>people get hooked on them.</v>

174
00:03:39.611 --> 00:03:39.911
<v Speaker 1>I sing.</v>

175
00:03:39.911 --> 00:03:41.070
<v Speaker 1>I think that's horseshit.</v>

176
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.770
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

177
00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.290
<v Speaker 1>Like Bacon is fucking delicious.</v>

178
00:03:44.291 --> 00:03:45.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm not quitting.</v>

179
00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.410
<v Speaker 1>I will never stop eating bacon.</v>

180
00:03:47.411 --> 00:03:48.820
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to fucking happen.</v>

181
00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.050
<v Speaker 1>It's too good.</v>

182
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.010
<v Speaker 1>When I sit there and I'm chewing on a crispy piece of Bacon,</v>

183
00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.080
<v Speaker 1>this cooked maybe just a little too long,</v>

184
00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:01.290
<v Speaker 1>but it's just crunching on my mouth and the saltiness and the sweetness of the</v>

185
00:04:01.331 --> 00:04:02.260
<v Speaker 1>pig fat.</v>

186
00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.980
<v Speaker 1>It's just warm and melting in my mouth as I chew it down.</v>

187
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.970
<v Speaker 1>Breaking down the crispy fat.</v>

188
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:11.703
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>

189
00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:12.641
<v Speaker 1>I'm not stopping.</v>

190
00:04:12.641 --> 00:04:13.990
<v Speaker 1>Never have any Naza.</v>

191
00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.560
<v Speaker 2>If you bake bacon at like four,</v>

192
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:18.860
<v Speaker 2>25 or 20 minutes,</v>

193
00:04:18.861 --> 00:04:19.694
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>

194
00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:20.481
<v Speaker 2>the perfect.</v>

195
00:04:20.481 --> 00:04:20.711
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

196
00:04:20.711 --> 00:04:20.830
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

197
00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:24.740
<v Speaker 2>it's translucent and it melts in your mouth and I swear to God of dictates like</v>

198
00:04:24.741 --> 00:04:24.921

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.190

209
00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.631
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

210
00:04:44.631 --> 00:04:45.650
<v Speaker 1>it's a ritual.</v>

211
00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.530
<v Speaker 1>He gets that fat bacon from wholefoods,</v>

212
00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:51.040

217
00:04:59.421 --> 00:05:00.590
<v Speaker 1>filling the house.</v>

218

225
00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:07.381
<v Speaker 2>my wife.</v>

00:05:07.381 --> 00:05:10.680
<v Speaker 2>You know how like women have sense like a woman to have a sense when you start</v>

227
00:05:10.681 --> 00:05:10.891
<v Speaker 2>dating.</v>

228
00:05:10.891 --> 00:05:11.130
<v Speaker 2>They were like,</v>

229
00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:11.230

232
00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:13.760
<v Speaker 2>I had a,</v>

233
00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:14.610
<v Speaker 2>I had a chick one time,</v>

234
00:05:14.611 --> 00:05:15.780
<v Speaker 2>it smelled like fucking Bologna.</v>

235
00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:16.623
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

236
00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:18.840
<v Speaker 2>Adam Dana for two years process.</v>

237
00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:19.620
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.600
<v Speaker 2>biscuits and fruit for the kids every fucking morning.</v>

242
00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:28.463
<v Speaker 2>Good call,</v>

243
00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:28.951
<v Speaker 2>good call.</v>

00:05:28.951 --> 00:05:29.820
<v Speaker 2>That's a good backrest.</v>

245
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.430
<v Speaker 2>My house reeks of bay.</v>

246
00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.300
<v Speaker 2>I'd even take my bacon game to the next level.</v>

247
00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:34.500
<v Speaker 2>When you go to buy your Bacon,</v>

248
00:05:34.501 --> 00:05:36.270
<v Speaker 2>if you buy it at like just a regular story,</v>

249
00:05:36.271 --> 00:05:37.970
<v Speaker 2>they have the thick cut you get.</v>

250
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:39.360
<v Speaker 2>Don't get the thick cut that spread out.</v>

251
00:05:39.361 --> 00:05:40.290
<v Speaker 2>Like playing cards,</v>

252
00:05:40.291 --> 00:05:40.710
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

253
00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:41.580
<v Speaker 2>like fanned out,</v>

254
00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:44.190
<v Speaker 2>get the thick cut that's packed in like dollar bills.</v>

255
00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:46.000
<v Speaker 2>And then look at this.</v>

256
00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:50.220
<v Speaker 2>You've got to make sure that the beginning to the end of that thick cut is even.</v>

257
00:05:50.221 --> 00:05:51.270
<v Speaker 2>You don't want any dips in it.</v>

258
00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.070
<v Speaker 2>Go for fucking straight even.</v>

259
00:05:53.071 --> 00:05:55.080
<v Speaker 2>That's the most amount of bacon you can get for your money.</v>

260
00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:56.593
<v Speaker 2>I'll take them my bay.</v>

261
00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:58.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm taking my pink and pretty seriously</v>

262
00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:59.330
<v Speaker 1>needs to go to a butcher.</v>

263
00:05:59.331 --> 00:06:00.890
<v Speaker 1>That's when you take into the next level,</v>

264
00:06:00.891 --> 00:06:01.460
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

265
00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:02.810
<v Speaker 1>When you're really taking the next level,</v>

266
00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.720
<v Speaker 1>when you raise your own fucking pigs walk,</v>

267
00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:06.800
<v Speaker 1>raise your own pigs,</v>

268
00:06:06.801 --> 00:06:08.690
<v Speaker 1>get friendly with them and then shoot them right in the head,</v>

269
00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:10.580
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

270
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to lean my headlights into your bedroom windows through blah blah,</v>

271
00:06:14.511 --> 00:06:14.810
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

272
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:15.870
<v Speaker 1>redneck crazy redneck,</v>

273
00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.550
<v Speaker 1>crazy for fuck.</v>

274
00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:18.170
<v Speaker 1>But that.</v>

275
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:18.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

276
00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:19.280
<v Speaker 1>and people,</v>

277
00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:22.790
<v Speaker 1>it's playing on pop radio because it strikes a chord and I think some girls</v>

278
00:06:22.791 --> 00:06:23.270
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

279
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:23.571
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

280
00:06:23.571 --> 00:06:24.610
<v Speaker 1>he really was into,</v>

281
00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:25.101
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

282
00:06:25.101 --> 00:06:25.460
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

283
00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.940
<v Speaker 1>he really loved her because look at what he's doing on the other side and that's</v>

284
00:06:28.941 --> 00:06:29.480
<v Speaker 1>just the.</v>

285
00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:33.350
<v Speaker 1>That's just a tricky little trap that we got to transcend the least of my</v>

286
00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:34.070
<v Speaker 1>concerns.</v>

287
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:37.440
<v Speaker 1>My concerns is that there'll be guys that listened to it and think it's okay to</v>

288
00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:41.420
<v Speaker 1>act like that if a girl is so silly that she thinks all that.</v>

289
00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:42.590
<v Speaker 1>He just loves him.</v>

290
00:06:42.591 --> 00:06:44.150
<v Speaker 1>That's why he's all doing that.</v>

291
00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.290
<v Speaker 1>Shooting up the house.</v>

292
00:06:45.291 --> 00:06:46.124
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

293
00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:48.860
<v Speaker 1>You think he really wants to shoot up it's fucking house and just letting her</v>

294
00:06:48.861 --> 00:06:49.694
<v Speaker 1>know he loves</v>

295
00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.480
<v Speaker 1>his women who grow up like that.</v>

296
00:06:53.481 --> 00:06:56.150
<v Speaker 1>They all fucking black guy and there having this conversation to their kid with</v>

297
00:06:56.151 --> 00:06:58.640
<v Speaker 1>a Marlboro hanging out of their mouth lists and sugar.</v>

298
00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:03.280
<v Speaker 1>Your Dad and I have very passionate relationship and I pushed his buttons and</v>

299
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:03.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

300
00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.020
<v Speaker 1>and he loves me and if he didn't love me,</v>

301
00:07:06.021 --> 00:07:08.990
<v Speaker 1>he wouldn't fucking hit me and I know I don't make sense to you right now,</v>

302
00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:10.280
<v Speaker 1>but someday we'll.</v>

303
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:11.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

304
00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:12.773
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

305
00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:17.990
<v Speaker 1>That's this old paradigm that is in dire need of transcendence and the need is</v>

306
00:07:18.801 --> 00:07:19.634
<v Speaker 1>basically,</v>

307
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:19.911
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

308
00:07:19.911 --> 00:07:21.320
<v Speaker 1>we have to be fully full.</v>

309
00:07:21.321 --> 00:07:23.420
<v Speaker 1>I think Don Miguel Ruiz makes the example of,</v>

310
00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:24.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

311
00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:25.610
<v Speaker 1>create enough self,</v>

312
00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:26.110
<v Speaker 1>love enough,</v>

313
00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:30.020
<v Speaker 1>self satisfaction enough inside yourself that you don't need anything from</v>

314
00:07:30.021 --> 00:07:30.854
<v Speaker 1>anybody else.</v>

315
00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:33.350
<v Speaker 1>Your kitchen is fully stocked so you're not starving.</v>

316
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:38.660
<v Speaker 1>You stock your own kitchen with your own self fulfillment and then you don't</v>

317
00:07:38.661 --> 00:07:41.720
<v Speaker 1>need to eat any little burger that comes on the side of the road or something.</v>

318
00:07:41.721 --> 00:07:42.830
<v Speaker 1>Hot Dog from a stand.</v>

319
00:07:42.831 --> 00:07:44.360
<v Speaker 1>Whatever you can get because you're starving.</v>

320
00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:45.830
<v Speaker 1>You got plenty to eat.</v>

321
00:07:45.831 --> 00:07:46.281
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

322
00:07:46.281 --> 00:07:47.660
<v Speaker 1>I think the analogy that we need to have.</v>

323
00:07:47.661 --> 00:07:51.530
<v Speaker 1>We need to be full and whole and we need to have standards as human beings we</v>

324
00:07:51.531 --> 00:07:53.240
<v Speaker 1>accept of ourselves,</v>

325
00:07:53.241 --> 00:07:55.040
<v Speaker 1>like what you shouldn't accept from yourself.</v>

326
00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:57.560
<v Speaker 1>Don't accept from yourself that you're the guy that's going to be outside</v>

327
00:07:57.561 --> 00:07:58.910
<v Speaker 1>someone's house at 3:00 in the morning,</v>

328
00:07:58.911 --> 00:08:01.430
<v Speaker 1>shiny head light to their fucking windows and throwing beer cans.</v>

329
00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:02.810
<v Speaker 1>Don't accept that you're that guy.</v>

330
00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:03.310
<v Speaker 1>You're not.</v>

331
00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:05.600
<v Speaker 1>You can't be that guy if you're that guy.</v>

332
00:08:05.601 --> 00:08:07.310
<v Speaker 1>No one's gonna come to you for advice.</v>

333
00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:08.990
<v Speaker 1>No one's going to take you seriously.</v>

334
00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:09.191
<v Speaker 1>You're.</v>

335
00:08:09.191 --> 00:08:10.490
<v Speaker 1>You're a fucking dumb ass.</v>

336
00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:14.420
<v Speaker 1>You're a dumb ass child who gives into every whim.</v>

337
00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.890
<v Speaker 1>It's like someone who comes after one stroke every time.</v>

338
00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:17.450
<v Speaker 1>I can't help,</v>

339
00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:19.520
<v Speaker 1>but like you're a baby.</v>

340
00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:20.930
<v Speaker 1>You're a fucking baby.</v>

341
00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:22.850
<v Speaker 1>You learned some goddamn discipline.</v>

342
00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:23.301

346
00:08:24.921 --> 00:08:25.191
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

353
00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:32.210
<v Speaker 1>That's why there's so many of us.</v>

373
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:58.680
<v Speaker 1>who have been getting some pleasure from another entity.</v>
