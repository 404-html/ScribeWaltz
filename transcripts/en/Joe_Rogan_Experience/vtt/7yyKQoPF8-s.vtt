00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.700
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:03.350
<v Speaker 1>And when you structure your stories,</v>

3
00:00:03.351 --> 00:00:06.840
<v Speaker 1>do you use a software program to use index cards on a,</v>

4
00:00:06.841 --> 00:00:08.150
<v Speaker 1>a bulletin board?</v>

5
00:00:08.151 --> 00:00:12.770
<v Speaker 1>Like how do you set up where you're moving all your pieces in your tetris game?</v>

6
00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.450
<v Speaker 2>I used to things we do use,</v>

7
00:00:14.451 --> 00:00:15.284
<v Speaker 2>I got a,</v>

8
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:15.950
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

9
00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.660
<v Speaker 2>magnetic whiteboard in the office and write on the index cards and put them all</v>

10
00:00:20.661 --> 00:00:21.261
<v Speaker 2>up with that.</v>

11
00:00:21.261 --> 00:00:21.921
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes,</v>

12
00:00:21.921 --> 00:00:22.071
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

13
00:00:22.071 --> 00:00:23.150
<v Speaker 2>strings between the cards,</v>

14
00:00:23.151 --> 00:00:23.781
<v Speaker 2>that kind of thing.</v>

15
00:00:23.781 --> 00:00:27.020
<v Speaker 2>That's the general getting it all down the flow.</v>

16
00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.360
<v Speaker 2>And then I use a program called scrivener,</v>

17
00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.460
<v Speaker 2>which people can use for Mac or PC.</v>

18
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.470
<v Speaker 2>And it's basically the same thing.</v>

19
00:00:33.471 --> 00:00:36.740
<v Speaker 2>It's little index cards in the computer and there's an index card that</v>

20
00:00:36.741 --> 00:00:38.450
<v Speaker 2>represents a document,</v>

21
00:00:38.451 --> 00:00:39.890
<v Speaker 2>each document as a chapter.</v>

22
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.911
<v Speaker 2>But it's great.</v>

23
00:00:40.911 --> 00:00:45.500
<v Speaker 2>It's better than Microsoft word because Microsoft word,</v>

24
00:00:45.501 --> 00:00:46.760
<v Speaker 2>once you get a bit pass a hundred pages,</v>

25
00:00:46.761 --> 00:00:47.331
<v Speaker 2>200 pages,</v>

26
00:00:47.331 --> 00:00:50.510
<v Speaker 2>you're copping big chunks and moving around and it becomes a nightmare cause</v>

27
00:00:50.511 --> 00:00:51.530
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna screw something up.</v>

28
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:53.271
<v Speaker 2>But Scribner,</v>

29
00:00:53.271 --> 00:00:55.640
<v Speaker 2>he's grabbed this icon and drag it before this icon.</v>

30
00:00:55.641 --> 00:00:56.690
<v Speaker 2>It rearranges everything.</v>

31
00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.310
<v Speaker 2>So I've gotten pretty adept at using that.</v>

32
00:00:58.311 --> 00:00:59.300
<v Speaker 2>A highly recommend it.</v>

33
00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.910
<v Speaker 2>It's great for scatterbrain to keep everything flowing.</v>

34
00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.710
<v Speaker 2>And then a lot of times it'll just be,</v>

35
00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:04.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

36
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.310
<v Speaker 2>I get overwhelmed with the screen and everything going on and I'll just pull out</v>

37
00:01:07.311 --> 00:01:10.220
<v Speaker 2>the three by five index cards and start writing everything down again,</v>

38
00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.580
<v Speaker 2>bullet points and those put them up on the board and go through it that way.</v>

39
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.050
<v Speaker 1>So you like to do it digitally,</v>

40
00:01:16.051 --> 00:01:17.570
<v Speaker 1>you like to do it manually,</v>

41
00:01:17.571 --> 00:01:21.560
<v Speaker 1>you like to just mix it up and constantly keep doing it in a different way that</v>

42
00:01:21.561 --> 00:01:22.850
<v Speaker 1>keeps your brain moving?</v>

43
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

44
00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.210
<v Speaker 2>What I find is when you get stuck,</v>

45
00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:26.500
<v Speaker 2>there's a couple of different things.</v>

46
00:01:26.501 --> 00:01:26.861
<v Speaker 2>Number one,</v>

47
00:01:26.861 --> 00:01:27.900
<v Speaker 2>if you just staring at that screen,</v>

48
00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:28.743
<v Speaker 2>you're stuck.</v>

49
00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.060
<v Speaker 2>Just getting your hands involved and a pen and I,</v>

50
00:01:31.061 --> 00:01:31.221
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

51
00:01:31.221 --> 00:01:34.170
<v Speaker 2>like just an ink pen and paper is a tactile experiences,</v>

52
00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.901
<v Speaker 2>different experience.</v>

53
00:01:34.901 --> 00:01:37.150
<v Speaker 2>It activates different parts of your brain sometimes can like,</v>

54
00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.140
<v Speaker 2>oh now I get it,</v>

55
00:01:38.141 --> 00:01:39.310
<v Speaker 2>now I see what I was stuck on.</v>

56
00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:40.630
<v Speaker 2>So that's part of it.</v>

57
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.060
<v Speaker 2>And other parts of it is either,</v>

58
00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.470
<v Speaker 2>there's only so much screen real estate,</v>

59
00:01:44.471 --> 00:01:46.330
<v Speaker 2>so you can only see so many things at one time.</v>

60
00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:47.591
<v Speaker 2>If you're really stuck,</v>

61
00:01:47.591 --> 00:01:48.190
<v Speaker 2>you pull back,</v>

62
00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.461
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

63
00:01:48.461 --> 00:01:49.241
<v Speaker 2>All these index cards,</v>

64
00:01:49.241 --> 00:01:49.841
<v Speaker 2>you put it up in this,</v>

65
00:01:49.841 --> 00:01:50.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

66
00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.550
<v Speaker 2>four foot by five foot whiteboard and you kind of look at everything that can</v>

67
00:01:54.551 --> 00:01:56.410
<v Speaker 2>spring your brain free at times too.</v>

68
00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.120
<v Speaker 2>So it's largely,</v>

69
00:01:58.121 --> 00:01:59.230
<v Speaker 2>it's grabbing whatever's,</v>

70
00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:00.670
<v Speaker 2>if I get stuck in one area,</v>

71
00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.690
<v Speaker 2>I'll start going to other areas and um,</v>

72
00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.190
<v Speaker 2>when I get really overwhelmed and frustrated,</v>

73
00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.710
<v Speaker 2>I am more comfortable slipping back into,</v>

74
00:02:08.711 --> 00:02:08.951
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

75
00:02:08.951 --> 00:02:10.300
<v Speaker 2>the eight year old version of me,</v>

76
00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.320
<v Speaker 2>which is a little piece of paper and some notes or an index card and go back and</v>

77
00:02:14.321 --> 00:02:16.090
<v Speaker 2>just ride it out until it all kind of flows out of it.</v>

78
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.950
<v Speaker 1>So as long as the process is just continuing over and over and over again,</v>

79
00:02:19.951 --> 00:02:20.280
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

80
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.240
<v Speaker 1>that's a scrivener.</v>

81
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.720
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

82
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.901
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

83
00:02:21.901 --> 00:02:23.540
<v Speaker 1>I use that for jokes I used.</v>

84
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:24.593
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

85
00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:25.533
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

86
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.310
<v Speaker 1>I use it.</v>

87
00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.160
<v Speaker 1>I use a,</v>

88
00:02:27.161 --> 00:02:28.100
<v Speaker 1>a couple of different things.</v>

89
00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.620
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

90
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.350
<v Speaker 1>I use a real chalkboard or real a corkboard rather.</v>

91
00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.010
<v Speaker 1>And I have index cards and I put 'em up with pins and I have bits.</v>

92
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.110
<v Speaker 1>I have a one star,</v>

93
00:02:37.111 --> 00:02:38.400
<v Speaker 1>two star and three star.</v>

94
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.230
<v Speaker 1>One star is a completely new bit,</v>

95
00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.071
<v Speaker 1>two stars a bit.</v>

96
00:02:41.071 --> 00:02:42.030
<v Speaker 1>That's still improving.</v>

97
00:02:42.031 --> 00:02:43.140
<v Speaker 1>Three stars is a bit,</v>

98
00:02:43.141 --> 00:02:44.880
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty close to being done.</v>

99
00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.160
<v Speaker 1>They always grow and change and get weird.</v>

100
00:02:47.161 --> 00:02:50.100
<v Speaker 1>And there's always like new directions they take on certain shows.</v>

101
00:02:50.101 --> 00:02:51.570
<v Speaker 1>And because I mixed them up too,</v>

102
00:02:51.571 --> 00:02:56.400
<v Speaker 1>I'll mix up the order of like the different pieces inside the bit to try to</v>

103
00:02:56.401 --> 00:02:57.810
<v Speaker 1>figure out which way works.</v>

104
00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.150
<v Speaker 1>And I liked scrivener because could take those cards and just move them around.</v>

105
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.670
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes when I'm just studying,</v>

106
00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:04.930
<v Speaker 1>just thinking about my act,</v>

107
00:03:04.931 --> 00:03:06.760
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'll listen to recordings.</v>

108
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.820
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the most uncomfortable parts of standup.</v>

109
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.630
<v Speaker 1>But I think one of the most important,</v>

110
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.700
<v Speaker 1>you got to listen and see yourself,</v>

111
00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.520
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

112
00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.890
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

113
00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:14.723
<v Speaker 1>and listened to like,</v>

114
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.921
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

115
00:03:14.921 --> 00:03:15.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't like how I did that.</v>

116
00:03:15.851 --> 00:03:16.541
<v Speaker 1>Like there's too much,</v>

117
00:03:16.541 --> 00:03:20.380
<v Speaker 1>too much bullshit and that joke and that this joke is Kinda clunky and the</v>

118
00:03:20.381 --> 00:03:24.640
<v Speaker 1>wording's not good or the inflection is too fake or what have you.</v>

119
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.450
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

120
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:25.811
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

121
00:03:25.811 --> 00:03:26.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

122
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.900
<v Speaker 1>that process is aided by that.</v>

123
00:03:28.901 --> 00:03:31.300
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that I really love was going to ask you about is right</v>

124
00:03:31.301 --> 00:03:31.680
<v Speaker 1>room ever.</v>

125
00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.500
<v Speaker 1>He's right room.</v>

126
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.600
<v Speaker 1>I've used it just to look on the phone now.</v>

127
00:03:34.601 --> 00:03:37.990
<v Speaker 1>Right room is the one that takes your entire screen and makes it black and gives</v>

128
00:03:37.991 --> 00:03:39.310
<v Speaker 1>you that green tag that to you.</v>

129
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:40.400
<v Speaker 1>Oh does it really?</v>

130
00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.720
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

131
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.300
<v Speaker 1>he's got a white out or a blackout feature on,</v>

132
00:03:43.301 --> 00:03:45.550
<v Speaker 1>I can get rid of everything on the screen except what you're reading.</v>

133
00:03:45.551 --> 00:03:46.420
<v Speaker 1>So kind of the same thing.</v>

134
00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:46.721
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

135
00:03:46.721 --> 00:03:46.961
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

136
00:03:46.961 --> 00:03:47.410
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>

137
00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

138
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:49.090
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a right room.</v>

139
00:03:49.091 --> 00:03:50.500
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't give you access to anything.</v>

140
00:03:50.501 --> 00:03:51.760
<v Speaker 1>You can't go to the tool bar.</v>

141
00:03:51.761 --> 00:03:52.870
<v Speaker 1>You can say what time it is.</v>

142
00:03:52.871 --> 00:03:53.704
<v Speaker 1>You don't get shit.</v>

143
00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:54.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

144
00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.551
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

145
00:03:54.551 --> 00:03:54.761
<v Speaker 1>Room.</v>

146
00:03:54.761 --> 00:03:55.594
<v Speaker 1>That's what it looks like.</v>

147
00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:56.321
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>

148
00:03:56.321 --> 00:03:56.891
<v Speaker 1>really like it.</v>

149
00:03:56.891 --> 00:03:57.724
<v Speaker 1>It's my favorite.</v>

150
00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.580
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

151
00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.390
<v Speaker 1>it's something I probably need to start using more in scrivener because I get</v>

152
00:04:01.391 --> 00:04:04.300
<v Speaker 1>distracted and trying to stay in touch with social media and everything else.</v>

153
00:04:04.301 --> 00:04:06.550
<v Speaker 1>And if you're on the computer and a fan is asking a question,</v>

154
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.280
<v Speaker 1>the natural impulses to go answer that question.</v>

155
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.000
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

156
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

157
00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:11.950
<v Speaker 1>getting to a point where I can just ignore all that.</v>

158
00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.970
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

159
00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.970
<v Speaker 1>I was just in Vegas for the new media expo and when I really get into it and I</v>

160
00:04:18.221 --> 00:04:19.300
<v Speaker 1>was under deadline,</v>

161
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.000
<v Speaker 1>so I started writing at noon.</v>

162
00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.360
<v Speaker 1>We were staying at the Rio,</v>

163
00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.310
<v Speaker 1>don't have the seafood buffet at the rail.</v>

164
00:04:24.311 --> 00:04:25.060
<v Speaker 1>I will tell you that.</v>

165
00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.893
<v Speaker 1>How dare you.</v>

166
00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:26.733
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

167
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.690
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

168
00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.110
<v Speaker 1>I said that the top,</v>

169
00:04:29.111 --> 00:04:31.470
<v Speaker 1>the best vomit of my whole life and has been a lot of vomiting,</v>

170
00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:32.740
<v Speaker 1>clams and a musket.</v>

171
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:33.130
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

172
00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.963
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know.</v>

173
00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.141
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it was,</v>

174
00:04:35.141 --> 00:04:35.800
<v Speaker 1>but it was,</v>

175
00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:36.910
<v Speaker 1>it was Linda Blair shit.</v>

176
00:04:36.911 --> 00:04:37.870
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy.</v>

177
00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.890
<v Speaker 1>But I'm,</v>

178
00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:42.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm writing and it's like noon out and like there's the window and the window is</v>

179
00:04:42.341 --> 00:04:45.670
<v Speaker 1>open and by the time I got finished it looked out and it was pitch black</v>

180
00:04:45.671 --> 00:04:46.151
<v Speaker 1>outside.</v>

181
00:04:46.151 --> 00:04:50.500
<v Speaker 1>So sometimes I can't imagine it's the same thing when you're writing more of the</v>

182
00:04:50.501 --> 00:04:52.420
<v Speaker 1>short form jokes and moving around from the jokes.</v>

183
00:04:52.421 --> 00:04:54.790
<v Speaker 1>But for this long form things like 50 page story,</v>

184
00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.160
<v Speaker 1>I had my own screen came up and I,</v>

185
00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.200
<v Speaker 1>that's all I was working on.</v>

186
00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.140
<v Speaker 1>I didn't look at anything else.</v>

187
00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:00.130
<v Speaker 1>Just wrote the whole thing through.</v>

188
00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.551
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

189
00:05:00.551 --> 00:05:01.690
<v Speaker 1>you can get in those zones.</v>

190
00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't write jokes like joke jokes.</v>

191
00:05:04.511 --> 00:05:08.230
<v Speaker 1>What I do is I write about subjects and I find the jokes in what I write about</v>

192
00:05:08.231 --> 00:05:09.190
<v Speaker 1>it when he went.</v>

193
00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.890
<v Speaker 1>What I find is that when I'm writing about things,</v>

194
00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.330
<v Speaker 1>it takes longer for me to write the word history then for me to think of it or</v>

195
00:05:16.331 --> 00:05:17.164
<v Speaker 1>know it exists.</v>

196
00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.680
<v Speaker 1>If I'm thinking about history I can think about it.</v>

197
00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:21.870
<v Speaker 1>But I have to say his tier.</v>

198
00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean I have to actually individually type all the letters and in that you,</v>

199
00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:31.180
<v Speaker 1>you have much more consideration to every sentence that you write every,</v>

200
00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.440
<v Speaker 1>every chapter,</v>

201
00:05:32.441 --> 00:05:33.670
<v Speaker 1>every concept.</v>

202
00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:34.960
<v Speaker 1>Cause you're,</v>

203
00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.420
<v Speaker 1>you're thinking a lot quicker than your writing.</v>

204
00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.700
<v Speaker 1>So as you're writing it down,</v>

205
00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.280
<v Speaker 1>you're considering deeply each indivi.</v>

206
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:47.110
<v Speaker 1>It's like its forces you to pause and consider each individual word.</v>

207
00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:48.210
<v Speaker 1>Consider the,</v>

208
00:05:48.211 --> 00:05:48.481
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

209
00:05:48.481 --> 00:05:48.760
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

210
00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.060
<v Speaker 1>the concept of you're actually talking about far more than if you were just</v>

211
00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:53.260
<v Speaker 1>having a conversation.</v>

212
00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:54.610
<v Speaker 1>You're having a conversation.</v>

213
00:05:54.611 --> 00:05:55.120
<v Speaker 1>It takes more,</v>

214
00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.511
<v Speaker 1>it takes,</v>

215
00:05:55.511 --> 00:05:57.530
<v Speaker 1>it's much quicker to get the words right.</v>

216
00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.200
<v Speaker 1>I think in that slowing you down,</v>

217
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.860
<v Speaker 1>it makes you consider things more and then sometimes you'll just miss like</v>

218
00:06:03.861 --> 00:06:04.820
<v Speaker 1>really obvious shit.</v>

219
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.400
<v Speaker 1>You would have missed it if you were talking,</v>

220
00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:08.420
<v Speaker 1>but when you're riding like,</v>

221
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:08.870
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

222
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:10.220
<v Speaker 1>and what about this?</v>

223
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.580
<v Speaker 1>And then you'll go off in some other directions.</v>

224
00:06:12.581 --> 00:06:14.570
<v Speaker 1>Like you give your brain like a different rhythm.</v>

225
00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:15.920
<v Speaker 1>The rhythm of writing.</v>

226
00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:16.940
<v Speaker 1>No talking,</v>

227
00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:17.241
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

228
00:06:17.241 --> 00:06:17.750
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

229
00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:18.620
<v Speaker 1>no distractions,</v>

230
00:06:18.621 --> 00:06:19.520
<v Speaker 1>no fucking music.</v>

231
00:06:19.521 --> 00:06:20.570
<v Speaker 1>Stop all the nonsense.</v>

232
00:06:20.571 --> 00:06:21.404
<v Speaker 1>Locked the door,</v>

233
00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:23.750
<v Speaker 1>hit the right room and just go.</v>

234
00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:24.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

235
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:24.950
<v Speaker 1>Do you find,</v>

236
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:28.010
<v Speaker 1>do you find you have to go for a certain amount of time before all of a sudden</v>

237
00:06:28.011 --> 00:06:29.060
<v Speaker 1>shit starts to take off?</v>

238
00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm useless for the first half hour.</v>

239
00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:31.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

240
00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:31.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

241
00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:32.540
<v Speaker 1>So let's ask some harder.</v>

242
00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:33.650
<v Speaker 1>It was full of the word.</v>

243
00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:35.800
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I,</v>

244
00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:39.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't even take credit for the things I write because it's not me writing</v>

245
00:06:39.021 --> 00:06:39.550
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

246
00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:40.070
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

247
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.551
<v Speaker 1>It's your inner,</v>

248
00:06:40.551 --> 00:06:41.450
<v Speaker 1>your inner muse.</v>

249
00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:42.343
<v Speaker 1>We'd wrote it.</v>

250
00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:43.760
<v Speaker 1>We wrote that one.</v>

251
00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:44.061
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

252
00:06:44.061 --> 00:06:45.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how that one in me,</v>

253
00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:46.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

254
00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.740
<v Speaker 1>the first 30 minutes are usually just trash,</v>

255
00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:49.760
<v Speaker 1>absolute trash work,</v>

256
00:06:49.761 --> 00:06:52.670
<v Speaker 1>and then at some point something just takes over and you're making really good</v>

257
00:06:52.671 --> 00:06:53.060
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

258
00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:53.661
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting,</v>

259
00:06:53.661 --> 00:06:54.021
<v Speaker 1>isn't it,</v>

260
00:06:54.021 --> 00:06:58.400
<v Speaker 1>that that weird switch that goes off where you find yourself really zen in what</v>

261
00:06:58.401 --> 00:06:59.234
<v Speaker 1>you're doing?</v>

262
00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:00.201
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>

263
00:07:00.201 --> 00:07:01.640
<v Speaker 1>it is probably around the same time,</v>

264
00:07:01.641 --> 00:07:03.920
<v Speaker 1>about 30 minutes in 2030 minutes.</v>

265
00:07:03.921 --> 00:07:04.850
<v Speaker 1>The first 20 minutes just,</v>

266
00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:05.631
<v Speaker 1>I don't even think,</v>

267
00:07:05.631 --> 00:07:10.631
<v Speaker 1>I'm just trying to smash keys and write things down and just thinking,</v>

268
00:07:10.881 --> 00:07:12.830
<v Speaker 1>but just kind of getting into it and trying to,</v>

269
00:07:12.831 --> 00:07:14.990
<v Speaker 1>and then somewhere along the line he catch traction.</v>

270
00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:16.550
<v Speaker 1>My add so bad.</v>

271
00:07:16.551 --> 00:07:20.780
<v Speaker 1>Now I've got a technique like I'll just set the alarm on the phone instead of 30</v>

272
00:07:20.781 --> 00:07:22.070
<v Speaker 1>minutes and then I'm like,</v>

273
00:07:22.071 --> 00:07:22.311
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

274
00:07:22.311 --> 00:07:23.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm just not going to look at anything else.</v>

275
00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:25.280
<v Speaker 1>I can do this for 30 minutes.</v>

276
00:07:25.281 --> 00:07:27.040
<v Speaker 1>It's just 30 minutes that bad.</v>

277
00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:27.211
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

278
00:07:27.211 --> 00:07:27.800
<v Speaker 1>it's bad.</v>

279
00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.360
<v Speaker 1>Force yourself to write for 30 minutes.</v>

280
00:07:29.361 --> 00:07:30.350
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't matter what you write.</v>

281
00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:33.560
<v Speaker 1>And then almost invariably by the time the buzzer goes off,</v>

282
00:07:33.561 --> 00:07:35.000
<v Speaker 1>you're just like turn it off and you're just like,</v>

283
00:07:35.001 --> 00:07:35.361
<v Speaker 1>cause you're,</v>

284
00:07:35.361 --> 00:07:36.350
<v Speaker 1>you're rolling at that point.</v>

285
00:07:36.351 --> 00:07:39.170
<v Speaker 1>But you have to force yourself to be like a half to get into the groove.</v>

286
00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:42.260
<v Speaker 1>My groove is usually also to move around the house.</v>

287
00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:45.620
<v Speaker 1>I like to pick up my laptop and go sit somewhere else,</v>

288
00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.090
<v Speaker 1>go sit in my uh,</v>

289
00:07:47.091 --> 00:07:47.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

290
00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:48.290
<v Speaker 1>sit in my living room,</v>

291
00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:49.790
<v Speaker 1>go sit upstairs,</v>

292
00:07:49.791 --> 00:07:50.990
<v Speaker 1>go sit in front of the TV.</v>

293
00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:51.830
<v Speaker 1>You don't even watch TV.</v>

294
00:07:51.831 --> 00:07:52.670
<v Speaker 1>Just sit on the couch.</v>

295
00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:53.121
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

296
00:07:53.121 --> 00:07:54.320
<v Speaker 1>I think that when I do that,</v>

297
00:07:54.321 --> 00:07:56.780
<v Speaker 1>instead of just being in my office and stare at the screen and sometimes just</v>

298
00:07:56.781 --> 00:07:57.830
<v Speaker 1>being in a different space,</v>

299
00:07:57.831 --> 00:07:59.910
<v Speaker 1>sitting in a different place to go,</v>

300
00:07:59.911 --> 00:08:00.111
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

301
00:08:00.111 --> 00:08:05.000
<v Speaker 1>we're here now and that just that changing of your routine,</v>

302
00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:08.900
<v Speaker 1>just a little variation on it sometimes can spark the mind.</v>

303
00:08:08.901 --> 00:08:10.790
<v Speaker 1>An interesting new direction you get.</v>

304
00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:14.210
<v Speaker 1>You get down these wormholes and just getting any other kind of sensory input,</v>

305
00:08:14.211 --> 00:08:16.610
<v Speaker 1>which goes back to now I'm going to write things down and said a type them out</v>

306
00:08:16.611 --> 00:08:19.190
<v Speaker 1>or anything like that can cause it's all in there.</v>

307
00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:20.900
<v Speaker 1>All that stuff you want to come up with is in there.</v>

308
00:08:20.901 --> 00:08:21.590
<v Speaker 1>It's not like you're,</v>

309
00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:21.921
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

310
00:08:21.921 --> 00:08:24.530
<v Speaker 1>it's not like you have a factory where you have to make all this crap.</v>

311
00:08:24.531 --> 00:08:25.550
<v Speaker 1>It's all already in there.</v>

312
00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:26.660
<v Speaker 1>You just kind of getting,</v>

313
00:08:26.661 --> 00:08:29.750
<v Speaker 1>figuring out how to mine it out of your own brain and put it onto the page.</v>

314
00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:31.820
<v Speaker 1>You know what I also find super beneficial.</v>

315
00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:32.773
<v Speaker 1>A Walk,</v>

316
00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:33.500
<v Speaker 1>a walk.</v>

317
00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:33.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

318
00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:34.640
<v Speaker 1>Walk,</v>

319
00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:35.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

320
00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:35.530
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

321
00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:38.090
<v Speaker 1>used to bring a recorder but now with these new cell phones,</v>

322
00:08:38.091 --> 00:08:42.020
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to use your phone can record amazing notes and I just go for a</v>

323
00:08:42.021 --> 00:08:42.291
<v Speaker 1>walk,</v>

324
00:08:42.291 --> 00:08:43.610
<v Speaker 1>walk my dogs or something like that,</v>

325
00:08:43.611 --> 00:08:44.390
<v Speaker 1>go down the street.</v>

326
00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:48.590
<v Speaker 1>And just when I'm thinking about something and I've got something in my head and</v>

327
00:08:48.591 --> 00:08:51.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm done writing and then I'm reviewing the things that I wrote and like how</v>

328
00:08:51.921 --> 00:08:52.754
<v Speaker 1>would I,</v>

329
00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:55.560
<v Speaker 1>how would I view this if I was a person who reading it?</v>

330
00:08:55.561 --> 00:08:56.100
<v Speaker 1>Like how would I,</v>

331
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:56.933
<v Speaker 1>how would I take this?</v>

332
00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:57.721
<v Speaker 1>Like I'll,</v>

333
00:08:57.721 --> 00:09:00.060
<v Speaker 1>I'll take it into consideration as I'm walking.</v>

334
00:09:00.061 --> 00:09:00.894
<v Speaker 1>It's like the fat,</v>

335
00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:01.171
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

336
00:09:01.171 --> 00:09:04.380
<v Speaker 1>there's something about forcing yourself to do a mundane,</v>

337
00:09:04.381 --> 00:09:05.610
<v Speaker 1>very obvious task,</v>

338
00:09:05.611 --> 00:09:06.061
<v Speaker 1>left foot,</v>

339
00:09:06.061 --> 00:09:06.511
<v Speaker 1>right foot,</v>

340
00:09:06.511 --> 00:09:06.901
<v Speaker 1>left foot,</v>

341
00:09:06.901 --> 00:09:07.291
<v Speaker 1>right foot,</v>

342
00:09:07.291 --> 00:09:10.010
<v Speaker 1>and then you can get into that groove of introspective thought.</v>

343
00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:10.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

344
00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:10.841
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

345
00:09:10.841 --> 00:09:11.461
<v Speaker 2>And it does,</v>

346
00:09:11.461 --> 00:09:12.360
<v Speaker 2>some of that to me is like,</v>

347
00:09:12.361 --> 00:09:12.630
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

348
00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:13.950
<v Speaker 2>I've got this little tiny office,</v>

349
00:09:13.951 --> 00:09:14.850
<v Speaker 2>but there's like a loop.</v>

350
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:18.960
<v Speaker 2>There's like four rooms and you actually go from kitchen to this room to the</v>

351
00:09:18.961 --> 00:09:20.490
<v Speaker 2>entryway to the writing room.</v>

352
00:09:20.491 --> 00:09:21.324
<v Speaker 2>And I just,</v>

353
00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:23.460
<v Speaker 2>I just start doing labs.</v>

354
00:09:23.461 --> 00:09:26.460
<v Speaker 2>And it usually doesn't take very long because you're turning right all the time,</v>

355
00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:27.631
<v Speaker 2>every two steps.</v>

356
00:09:27.631 --> 00:09:27.961
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

357
00:09:27.961 --> 00:09:30.960
<v Speaker 2>there's something about your brain has to put some level of attention on it,</v>

358
00:09:30.961 --> 00:09:32.130
<v Speaker 2>not walking into things.</v>

359
00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:35.430
<v Speaker 2>And that usually comes from the part that's blocking you.</v>

360
00:09:35.431 --> 00:09:36.360
<v Speaker 2>The part that stopped me.</v>

361
00:09:36.361 --> 00:09:37.650
<v Speaker 2>Like you're convincing yourself,</v>

362
00:09:37.651 --> 00:09:39.390
<v Speaker 2>you can't get this shit out and now.</v>

363
00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:39.720
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

364
00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:39.901
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

365
00:09:39.901 --> 00:09:40.141
<v Speaker 2>all right.</v>

366
00:09:40.141 --> 00:09:42.600
<v Speaker 2>Boom that run back to the desk and start writing similar things down really</v>

367
00:09:42.601 --> 00:09:42.930
<v Speaker 2>quick.</v>

368
00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:46.230
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever tried using speech recognition software for writing</v>

369
00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:48.390
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't work for me only because I'm,</v>

370
00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:51.270
<v Speaker 2>by the time I block a sentence down,</v>

371
00:09:51.271 --> 00:09:52.250
<v Speaker 2>it's probably already be written.</v>

372
00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:53.490
<v Speaker 2>Been rewritten three times.</v>

373
00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:54.301
<v Speaker 2>Start a sentence,</v>

374
00:09:54.301 --> 00:09:54.631
<v Speaker 2>go back,</v>

375
00:09:54.631 --> 00:09:55.081
<v Speaker 2>start sentence,</v>

376
00:09:55.081 --> 00:09:55.471
<v Speaker 2>go back.</v>

377
00:09:55.471 --> 00:09:58.020
<v Speaker 2>And unfortunately a pretty fast typer.</v>

378
00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:02.490
<v Speaker 2>I learned that a long time ago is I knew I wanted to write and yeah,</v>

379
00:10:02.491 --> 00:10:03.271
<v Speaker 2>I just changed things.</v>

380
00:10:03.271 --> 00:10:03.841
<v Speaker 2>Sell fast.</v>

381
00:10:03.841 --> 00:10:04.920
<v Speaker 2>Like it's all muscle memory now.</v>

382
00:10:04.921 --> 00:10:05.581
<v Speaker 2>It's like copy this,</v>

383
00:10:05.581 --> 00:10:05.971
<v Speaker 2>paste this,</v>

384
00:10:05.971 --> 00:10:06.804
<v Speaker 2>move this around.</v>

385
00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:07.390
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

386
00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:09.750
<v Speaker 2>I cannot imagine speech recognition would ever work for me.</v>

387
00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:11.000
<v Speaker 1>The um,</v>

388
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:11.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

389
00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:13.220
<v Speaker 1>Mavis Bacon teaches typing.</v>

390
00:10:13.221 --> 00:10:14.054
<v Speaker 1>That's the one I owe.</v>

391
00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:15.760
<v Speaker 1>I owe that Mavis Bacon.</v>

392
00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:16.643
<v Speaker 1>She looked me up.</v>

393
00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:17.721
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

394

<v Speaker 1>that was a for me man.</v>

395
00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:20.780
<v Speaker 1>I was the poker guy.</v>

396
00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:21.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

397
00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:23.150
<v Speaker 1>This looking right at them.</v>

398
00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:24.410
<v Speaker 1>It took a long time.</v>

399
00:10:24.411 --> 00:10:25.191
<v Speaker 1>Genius product.</v>

400
00:10:25.191 --> 00:10:25.370
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

401
00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:25.551
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

402
00:10:25.551 --> 00:10:27.620
<v Speaker 1>just play video games pitch and like what?</v>

403
00:10:27.621 --> 00:10:29.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm just playing video games and all of a sudden I can type.</v>

404
00:10:29.541 --> 00:10:30.301
<v Speaker 1>It was amazing.</v>

405
00:10:30.301 --> 00:10:33.470
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing and it's their fun games like you're racing and share what you're</v>

406
00:10:33.471 --> 00:10:33.621
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

407
00:10:33.621 --> 00:10:36.650
<v Speaker 1>All kinds of different stuff and figuring out where the little keys are.</v>

408
00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:37.520
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

409
00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:38.420
<v Speaker 1>that's so important,</v>

410
00:10:38.421 --> 00:10:38.960
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

411
00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:40.660
<v Speaker 1>I used to have one of those goofy keyboards.</v>

412
00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:42.210
<v Speaker 1>It was like separated split ones.</v>

413
00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:42.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

414
00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:46.310
<v Speaker 1>and your hands rest on it and ship those tied off.</v>

415
00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:48.740
<v Speaker 1>What happened is supposed to be working on</v>

416
00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:50.220
<v Speaker 2>work for crap.</v>

417
00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:51.180
<v Speaker 2>They're supposed to be good for you.</v>

418
00:10:51.181 --> 00:10:53.100
<v Speaker 2>I had the one that actually was like a transformer.</v>

419
00:10:53.101 --> 00:10:56.850
<v Speaker 2>It actually had a hinge when this thing was bad ass.</v>

420
00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:59.480
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever get the one where you sink in?</v>

421
00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:00.890
<v Speaker 1>You sink your fingers in.</v>

422
00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:04.370
<v Speaker 1>There was a weird one like this or your fingers like sit in a cradle.</v>

423
00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:05.390
<v Speaker 1>I still have to look</v>

424
00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:08.260
<v Speaker 2>like every now and then I'm still glancing down to get some kind of tracking</v>

425
00:11:08.261 --> 00:11:09.094
<v Speaker 2>going on,</v>

426
00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:10.390
<v Speaker 2>which I don't need to do any more,</v>

427
00:11:10.391 --> 00:11:12.400
<v Speaker 2>but I can't break myself of the habit like I can.</v>

428
00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:13.593
<v Speaker 2>I can.</v>

429
00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:14.351
<v Speaker 2>I do this.</v>

430
00:11:14.351 --> 00:11:16.540
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes when I'm overwhelmed with an idea,</v>

431
00:11:16.541 --> 00:11:19.980
<v Speaker 2>I'll just close my eyes and just start typing so I don't need to do it anymore,</v>

432
00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:20.800
<v Speaker 2>but I'm still,</v>

433
00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.780
<v Speaker 2>I can't break that habit of looking down at the screen.</v>

434
00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:24.141
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>

435
00:11:24.141 --> 00:11:24.441
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>

436
00:11:24.441 --> 00:11:24.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

437
00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:25.011
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

438
00:11:25.011 --> 00:11:26.000
<v Speaker 1>I had one of those.</v>

439
00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:27.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

440
00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:30.620
<v Speaker 1>there was those and then there was the Microsoft ones are a little bit more</v>

441
00:11:30.621 --> 00:11:33.410
<v Speaker 1>curly and they had like an actual space in between.</v>

442
00:11:33.411 --> 00:11:34.244
<v Speaker 1>It didn't separate.</v>

443
00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:34.851
<v Speaker 1>They're just,</v>

444
00:11:34.851 --> 00:11:35.900
<v Speaker 1>it's more like lumpy.</v>

445
00:11:35.901 --> 00:11:39.680
<v Speaker 1>They called them ergonomic keyboards things anymore.</v>

446
00:11:39.681 --> 00:11:40.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't think,</v>

447
00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:41.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

448
00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:42.200
<v Speaker 1>You know what the problem is?</v>

449
00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:43.280
<v Speaker 1>You get used to those,</v>

450
00:11:43.281 --> 00:11:44.640
<v Speaker 1>then you go to a laptop and it's,</v>

451
00:11:44.641 --> 00:11:45.474
<v Speaker 1>it feels weird,</v>

452
00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:48.980
<v Speaker 1>you know a lot of people are typing their stuff on laptops now,</v>

453
00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:54.190
<v Speaker 1>so like the way you learn how to type on a laptop is you want your to be right</v>

454
00:11:54.191 --> 00:11:57.850
<v Speaker 1>in that position of j and f the fingers across the board and then from there you</v>

455
00:11:57.851 --> 00:11:58.600
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>

456
00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:01.480
<v Speaker 1>If you go back and forth from laptop to keyboard,</v>

457
00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:05.310
<v Speaker 1>this is like a thinking part where you have to like a quarterback changing.</v>

458
00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:05.951
<v Speaker 1>You're throwing lotion,</v>

459
00:12:05.951 --> 00:12:07.540
<v Speaker 1>it's to change everything around.</v>

460
00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:07.811
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

461
00:12:07.811 --> 00:12:08.644
<v Speaker 1>It fucks with you.</v>

462
00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:09.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

463
00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:12.910
<v Speaker 1>But the speech recognition software is fascinating to me because I wonder if</v>

464
00:12:12.911 --> 00:12:15.480
<v Speaker 1>that I'll ever be something that I'm interested in because,</v>

465
00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:16.343
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

466
00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:17.331
<v Speaker 2>for the walks,</v>

467
00:12:17.331 --> 00:12:18.410
<v Speaker 2>I have to imagine,</v>

468
00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:19.491
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

469
00:12:19.491 --> 00:12:19.701
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

470
00:12:19.701 --> 00:12:20.181
<v Speaker 2>You're walking,</v>

471
00:12:20.181 --> 00:12:21.590
<v Speaker 2>you still speak everything down.</v>

472
00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:22.041
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

473
00:12:22.041 --> 00:12:22.940
<v Speaker 1>I just record it.</v>

474
00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:23.270
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

475
00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:23.991
<v Speaker 1>And Go back and listen to,</v>

476
00:12:23.991 --> 00:12:24.111
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

477
00:12:24.111 --> 00:12:25.190
<v Speaker 1>I go back and listen to it.</v>

478
00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:28.280
<v Speaker 1>I really find that there's a completely different state of mind,</v>

479
00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:30.410
<v Speaker 1>the actual writing state of mind,</v>

480
00:12:30.411 --> 00:12:35.411
<v Speaker 1>and I find that I'm way more creative when I could just sit in total silence,</v>

481
00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:38.240
<v Speaker 1>not hear my voice or anybody's voice and for right.</v>

482
00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:38.841
<v Speaker 1>I allow,</v>

483
00:12:38.841 --> 00:12:42.050
<v Speaker 1>allow my brain to go in all sorts of weird directions when they're not,</v>

484
00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:43.940
<v Speaker 1>it's not attached to flowing,</v>

485
00:12:43.941 --> 00:12:44.900
<v Speaker 1>moving language.</v>

486
00:12:44.901 --> 00:12:49.100
<v Speaker 1>Ideas can serve a merge instantaneously and I just try to follow them and</v>

487
00:12:49.101 --> 00:12:50.240
<v Speaker 1>capture them in writing.</v>

488
00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:51.261
<v Speaker 1>I think a,</v>

489
00:12:51.261 --> 00:12:53.240
<v Speaker 1>I limit myself when I'm actually talking.</v>

490
00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:54.170
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

491
00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:54.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

492
00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:55.280
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

493
00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:56.420
<v Speaker 2>it comes to writing things.</v>

494
00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:56.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

495
00:12:56.910 --> 00:12:57.350
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

496
00:12:57.350 --> 00:12:58.490
<v Speaker 2>it's for me,</v>

497
00:12:58.491 --> 00:12:59.810
<v Speaker 2>but at this point it's just down to,</v>

498
00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:01.790
<v Speaker 2>it's a process.</v>

499
00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:04.340
<v Speaker 2>Now I've got the process going and getting more and more comfort with the</v>

500
00:13:04.341 --> 00:13:04.761
<v Speaker 2>process.</v>

501
00:13:04.761 --> 00:13:06.680
<v Speaker 2>So hopefully I'm growing towards that.</v>

502
00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:06.980
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

503
00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:11.810
<v Speaker 2>Stephen King's process is just so fast that your process is also very creative.</v>

504
00:13:11.811 --> 00:13:12.021
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

505
00:13:12.021 --> 00:13:13.340
<v Speaker 2>you have to have this idea,</v>

506
00:13:13.341 --> 00:13:16.850
<v Speaker 2>you have to have the story of to create this story after that part's never</v>

507
00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:18.171
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

508
00:13:18.171 --> 00:13:19.400
<v Speaker 2>Some people talking about writer's block,</v>

509
00:13:19.401 --> 00:13:20.360
<v Speaker 2>I've never had that.</v>

510
00:13:20.361 --> 00:13:21.200
<v Speaker 2>I've had the opposite,</v>

511
00:13:21.201 --> 00:13:24.770
<v Speaker 2>which is just this on slot of cool ideas.</v>

512
00:13:24.771 --> 00:13:27.290
<v Speaker 2>Like this would be a good book and this be a good book and trying to try and</v>

513
00:13:27.291 --> 00:13:28.280
<v Speaker 2>keep track of everything.</v>

514
00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:29.081
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>

515
00:13:29.081 --> 00:13:30.050
<v Speaker 2>the creative part,</v>

516
00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:30.740
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

517
00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:31.573
<v Speaker 2>being scatterbrained,</v>

518
00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:34.340
<v Speaker 2>middle kid fortunately just has never been an issue for me.</v>

519
00:13:34.341 --> 00:13:34.911
<v Speaker 2>It's all it with me.</v>

520
00:13:34.911 --> 00:13:39.320
<v Speaker 2>It's always been the discipline of being able to write it down and trying to</v>

521
00:13:39.321 --> 00:13:41.150
<v Speaker 2>fight the add and you know,</v>

522
00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:45.800
<v Speaker 2>and like I have to keep working on this to make it the best it can be.</v>

523
00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:47.180
<v Speaker 2>When after the first draft,</v>

524
00:13:47.181 --> 00:13:48.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of already done with it.</v>

525
00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:48.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

526
00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:48.741
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

527
00:13:48.741 --> 00:13:49.030
<v Speaker 2>I want to,</v>

528
00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:49.910
<v Speaker 2>I want to go do something else.</v>

529
00:13:49.911 --> 00:13:50.331
<v Speaker 2>But you can't,</v>

530
00:13:50.331 --> 00:13:52.130
<v Speaker 2>you gotta go back and keep hammering on that sword,</v>

531
00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:52.520
<v Speaker 2>make it,</v>

532
00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:53.353
<v Speaker 2>make it a good weapon.</v>

533
00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:54.291
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

534
00:13:54.291 --> 00:13:54.621
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

535
00:13:54.621 --> 00:13:58.980
<v Speaker 2>that's really interesting that it's the different types of creative</v>

536
00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:01.530
<v Speaker 1>processes that all try to achieve the same thing,</v>

537
00:14:01.531 --> 00:14:03.600
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a song or a movie or a book or,</v>

538
00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:04.673
<v Speaker 1>or a joke.</v>

539
00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:06.540
<v Speaker 1>It's this completely fascinating to me.</v>

540
00:14:06.541 --> 00:14:08.670
<v Speaker 1>The different ways that people approach it and different,</v>

541
00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:12.180
<v Speaker 1>the different mindsets they have in approaching it too.</v>

542
00:14:12.181 --> 00:14:12.780
<v Speaker 1>Do</v>

543
00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:14.280
<v Speaker 2>you know that there's,</v>

544
00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:16.530
<v Speaker 2>there's no one pattern,</v>

545
00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:18.420
<v Speaker 2>which is what's fascinating about the human brain.</v>

546
00:14:18.421 --> 00:14:21.900
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's got a different way of doing it and just keep working at it till you</v>

547
00:14:21.901 --> 00:14:25.890
<v Speaker 2>get to that end product and where you can hopefully look at what you finished</v>

548
00:14:25.891 --> 00:14:28.770
<v Speaker 2>with and I think all creative people kind of have the same thing.</v>

549
00:14:28.771 --> 00:14:29.491
<v Speaker 2>You probably have it too,</v>

550
00:14:29.491 --> 00:14:31.050
<v Speaker 2>like that's a pretty good joke.</v>

551
00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:32.790
<v Speaker 2>That's not the best it could possibly be,</v>

552
00:14:32.791 --> 00:14:33.900
<v Speaker 2>but I think that's pretty good.</v>

553
00:14:33.901 --> 00:14:36.780
<v Speaker 2>That's going to go in the arsenal for the next stand up and with me,</v>

554
00:14:36.781 --> 00:14:38.550
<v Speaker 2>it's like that book is pretty good.</v>

555
00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.410
<v Speaker 2>I would work on that book for the next 10 years.</v>

556
00:14:40.411 --> 00:14:42.450
<v Speaker 2>Every day to try and make everything perfect.</v>

557
00:14:42.451 --> 00:14:43.580
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

558
00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:44.131
<v Speaker 2>at least for me,</v>

559
00:14:44.131 --> 00:14:44.361
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

560
00:14:44.361 --> 00:14:46.260
<v Speaker 2>there is no perfection like,</v>

561
00:14:46.261 --> 00:14:47.190
<v Speaker 2>and you hear some others go,</v>

562
00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:49.110
<v Speaker 2>I keep working on until I've absolutely the perfect,</v>

563
00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:51.000
<v Speaker 2>the perfect phrase and a perfect sentence in a perfect,</v>

564
00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.153
<v Speaker 2>in the perfect page,</v>

565
00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:53.000
<v Speaker 2>that's great.</v>

566
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:53.720
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

567
00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:57.380
<v Speaker 2>we got to put a book out and sell some books so I can't work on a book for 10</v>

568
00:14:57.381 --> 00:14:58.214
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

569
00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:07.790
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
