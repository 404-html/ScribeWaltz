00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:02.860
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:05.750
<v Speaker 2>You know I think about that last year I </v>
<v Speaker 2>did blow.</v>

3
00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.080
<v Speaker 2>I was ready to call 60 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4
00:00:09.081 --> 00:00:09.914
<v Speaker 2>Think of this state of mind right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I had already a pitch for 60 </v>

5
00:00:12.861 --> 00:00:16.070
<v Speaker 2>minutes to explain to them that I had </v>
<v Speaker 2>found the cure for cocaine.</v>

6
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.020
<v Speaker 2>If you do heroin on Mondays just a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit,</v>

7
00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:21.854
<v Speaker 2>you will not snort the rest of the week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I was really going to pit 60 </v>

8
00:00:25.281 --> 00:00:26.114
<v Speaker 2>minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was going to get an agent and go to </v>

9
00:00:26.901 --> 00:00:29.750
<v Speaker 2>CBS and the list.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a groundbreaking idea.</v>

10
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.063
<v Speaker 2>There's no reason for rehabs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll get that white powder you </v>

11
00:00:32.961 --> 00:00:34.210
<v Speaker 2>motherfuckers are going to war for</v>

12
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:36.753
<v Speaker 2>and we'll get that little white poppy </v>
<v Speaker 2>seed will make it into some pill and </v>

13
00:00:39.371 --> 00:00:40.204
<v Speaker 2>we'll get people high on Monday because </v>
<v Speaker 2>the rest of the week I didn't want to </v>

14
00:00:42.311 --> 00:00:44.240
<v Speaker 2>get high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How crazy is that?</v>

15
00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.940
<v Speaker 2>I was doing heroin on a Monday and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't let me do the rest of the week.</v>

16
00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.630
<v Speaker 2>I look forward to Mondays.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fox,</v>

17
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.080
<v Speaker 2>CSI Miami.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why only Monday?</v>

18
00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:54.840
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>

19
00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.390
<v Speaker 2>I have no fucking idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was just a week off,</v>

20
00:00:58.391 --> 00:01:00.490
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was just snorting it.</v>

21
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Snort at two little lines of heroin just</v>

22
00:01:03.641 --> 00:01:05.080
<v Speaker 2>to get me out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what does it do?</v>

23
00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:06.540
<v Speaker 2>Like what's the feeling?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hit.</v>

24
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.620
<v Speaker 2>Tell me what it feels like when it hits </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

25
00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.280
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it takes a couple minutes to hit and you</v>

26
00:01:12.281 --> 00:01:13.114
<v Speaker 2>feel this weird thing and then you feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>like your blood pressure going up and </v>

27
00:01:16.301 --> 00:01:21.040
<v Speaker 2>you feel like this euphoric warmth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You feel like this fucking to.</v>

28
00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.160
<v Speaker 2>I felt like my body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you ever take a white shit?</v>

29
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.850
<v Speaker 2>It's warmer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can see if you shit outside.</v>

30
00:01:27.851 --> 00:01:28.684

<v Speaker 2>That's what your body feels like that </v>

31
00:01:31.031 --> 00:01:33.580
<v Speaker 2>one and then I would get an urge to puke</v>

32
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.440
<v Speaker 2>for a couple minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would gag and Puke a little bit,</v>

33
00:01:37.441 --> 00:01:39.990
<v Speaker 2>would come out of yellow and then after </v>
<v Speaker 2>I put a little bit,</v>

34
00:01:39.991 --> 00:01:44.991
<v Speaker 2>I would just go into this state of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking bonus for four hours.</v>

35
00:01:45.211 --> 00:01:48.310
<v Speaker 2>It was like smoking in their cars all </v>
<v Speaker 2>day and mum onus,</v>

36
00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.730
<v Speaker 2>like just sitting there smoking a </v>
<v Speaker 2>cigarette,</v>

37
00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:51.683
<v Speaker 2>looking out a window,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'd make believe I was writing John </v>

38
00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.310
<v Speaker 2>Lennon type lyrics to until I looked at </v>
<v Speaker 2>them the next day.</v>

<v Speaker 2>This brilliance about a refrigerator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I remember writing a bit about a </v>

40
00:02:02.441 --> 00:02:06.060
<v Speaker 2>refrigerator once and looking at it the </v>
<v Speaker 2>next day and say,</v>

108
00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:42.870

<v Speaker 2>if I'm thinking it might be,</v>

109
00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:43.803
<v Speaker 2>I don't like doing documentaries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I need to do a documentary about </v>

110
00:05:46.991 --> 00:05:50.120
<v Speaker 2>this family because it's the rise and </v>
<v Speaker 2>fall of American family.</v>

111
00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:50.973
<v Speaker 2>I saw before my eyes as a child that </v>
<v Speaker 2>went over there and ate with them and </v>

112
00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:56.143
<v Speaker 2>hanging out with all three brothers by </v>
<v Speaker 2>the like I wasn't just friends or </v>

<v Speaker 2>but bone hood was my nighttime guy.</v>

115
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:09.560
<v Speaker 2>Bonehead used to take me into the murky </v>
<v Speaker 2>waters of the underworld.</v>

116
