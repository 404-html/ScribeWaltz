00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.460
<v Speaker 1>Hey everybody that sound in the back is </v>
<v Speaker 1>not me going to the bathroom.</v>

2
00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:09.690
<v Speaker 1>That's just pouring coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Folks.</v>

3
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.050
<v Speaker 1>Don't get crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This episode of the podcast is brought </v>

4
00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:16.020
<v Speaker 1>to you by a new sponsor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called blue apron and blue apron.</v>

5
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:16.860
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

6
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm just try this out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This week they sent it to me.</v>

7
00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:25.521
<v Speaker 1>This is what blue apron is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a way to get all the ingredients </v>

8
00:00:25.521 --> 00:00:28.740
<v Speaker 1>for healthy meals along with recipes </v>
<v Speaker 1>shipped to your house.</v>

9
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.690
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

10
00:00:30.691 --> 00:00:32.310
<v Speaker 1>I was a bit skeptical at first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

11
00:00:32.311 --> 00:00:37.311
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what exactly they're going to do and </v>

12
00:00:37.311 --> 00:00:37.311
<v Speaker 1>then they send you this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got this sheet,</v>

13
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.840
<v Speaker 1>it's got photographs of what everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>looks like,</v>

14
00:00:39.841 --> 00:00:44.841
<v Speaker 1>shows you how to cook everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the meals are between 500 and 700 </v>

15
00:00:44.841 --> 00:00:49.311
<v Speaker 1>calories per serving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A really interesting way to low </v>

16
00:00:49.311 --> 00:00:51.840
<v Speaker 1>calories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>low for how delicious they are.</v>

17
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.870
<v Speaker 1>It's all healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>excellent food and it's all stuff that </v>

18
00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.521
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to go to a store,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to going where they'll </v>

19
00:01:01.521 --> 00:01:04.950
<v Speaker 1>ship everything to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all like in these coolers that have</v>

20
00:01:04.951 --> 00:01:09.951
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's freeze dried or something </v>

21
00:01:09.951 --> 00:01:09.951
<v Speaker 1>like not freeze dried.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's that stuff called?</v>

22
00:01:09.951 --> 00:01:11.040
<v Speaker 1>Dry Eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dry Eyes to keep it cold,</v>

23
00:01:11.041 --> 00:01:12.120
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

24
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.330
<v Speaker 1>it sat inside my house for like 10 hours</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was still nice and cold when I </v>

25
00:01:17.401 --> 00:01:18.710
<v Speaker 1>opened it up and put it in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>frigerator.</v>

26
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.660

<v Speaker 1>were said,</v>

28
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.430

<v Speaker 1>totally idiot proof.</v>

29
00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.610
<v Speaker 1>They work around your schedule and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>dietary preferences and the cooking </v>

30
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.881

<v Speaker 1>blown away by the quality and the </v>

<v Speaker 1>freshness.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I've never heard anything like this </v>

40
00:02:05.171 --> 00:02:06.570
<v Speaker 1>before and like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was kind of like a bit skeptical,</v>

41
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.780
<v Speaker 1>but the meals are delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Last night I had had some,</v>

42
00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.990
<v Speaker 1>I forgot the name of the Tacos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was a steak Taco,</v>

43
00:02:15.991 --> 00:02:19.110
<v Speaker 1>but they all the spices they give you </v>
<v Speaker 1>like onions,</v>

44
00:02:19.111 --> 00:02:24.111

52
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.680
<v Speaker 1>We're also brought to you by ting and if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go to Rogan.ting.com,</v>

53
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.040
<v Speaker 1>you can get in on what is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>the future of cell phone purchasing and </v>

54
00:02:52.591 --> 00:02:55.930
<v Speaker 1>cell phone use in my opinion with Ting </v>
<v Speaker 1>does is they,</v>

55
00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.610
<v Speaker 1>they rent the sprint backbone so it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>just like having sprint phone except you</v>

56
00:03:00.611 --> 00:03:03.310
<v Speaker 1>have no contracts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have no early termination fees,</v>

57
00:03:03.311 --> 00:03:04.810
<v Speaker 1>no add ons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no bs,</v>

58
00:03:04.811 --> 00:03:08.500
<v Speaker 1>no weird hidden payments that you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do to deal with.</v>

59
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.390
<v Speaker 1>Most of the time when you buy a cell </v>
<v Speaker 1>phone,</v>

60
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.990
<v Speaker 1>if you buy a cell phone and the cell </v>
<v Speaker 1>phone says it costs $200,</v>

61
00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.230
<v Speaker 1>it's not really $200,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most likely it's probably quite a bit </v>

62
00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.771
<v Speaker 1>more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what they do is they defer that </v>

63
00:03:22.771 --> 00:03:22.771
<v Speaker 1>money over the course of the term of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your contract,</v>

64
00:03:22.771 --> 00:03:25.210
<v Speaker 1>so the phone might really cost $600 </v>
<v Speaker 1>bucks.</v>

65
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.970
<v Speaker 1>So for the next three years that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>under contract,</v>

66
00:03:27.971 --> 00:03:30.670
<v Speaker 1>you're slowly paying off that phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't realize that.</v>

67
00:03:30.671 --> 00:03:33.280
<v Speaker 1>So when you go to try to cancel your </v>
<v Speaker 1>contract,</v>

68
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.590
<v Speaker 1>you owe them a bunch of money and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of annoying.</v>

69
00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.640
<v Speaker 1>It's also annoying the way they have it </v>
<v Speaker 1>set up at most cell phone companies.</v>

70
00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.310
<v Speaker 1>Accepting this is the only one I know of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that does it differently.</v>

71
00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.090
<v Speaker 1>Ting has it setup where you only pay for</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you use.</v>

72
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.350
<v Speaker 1>Like say if you have like 120 minutes a </v>
<v Speaker 1>month plan,</v>

73
00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.180
<v Speaker 1>most of the time you're not going to use</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that.</v>

74
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.580
<v Speaker 1>And what happens when you don't use it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>

75
00:03:54.581 --> 00:03:56.950
<v Speaker 1>You don't get any money back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you use more,</v>

76
00:03:56.951 --> 00:03:59.170
<v Speaker 1>you pay more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get you a fee.</v>

77
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.780
<v Speaker 1>But if you use less,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do not get paid.</v>

78
00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.850
<v Speaker 1>You don't get that money back with Ting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you only pay for what you use.</v>

79
00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:12.090
<v Speaker 1>It's an awesome company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really love doing business with them </v>

80
00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.090
<v Speaker 1>because first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're completely,</v>

81
00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.980
<v Speaker 1>totally ethical there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're also very generous.</v>

82
00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.340
<v Speaker 1>When Tim had its two year anniversary </v>
<v Speaker 1>for no reason whatsoever,</v>

83
00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:23.050
<v Speaker 1>other than the fact that they wanted to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they decided to cut rates on slash rates</v>

84
00:04:23.051 --> 00:04:25.330
<v Speaker 1>on their data,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which really affected heavy users.</v>

85
00:04:25.331 --> 00:04:30.331
<v Speaker 1>Especially 98 percent of people would </v>
<v Speaker 1>save money with Tim and that is because </v>

86
00:04:30.341 --> 00:04:33.820
<v Speaker 1>they do mobile differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go to [inaudible] dot ting.com</v>

87
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000
<v Speaker 1>for more details.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have all the new and greatest </v>

88
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.330
<v Speaker 1>android phones available,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including the iphone five.</v>

89
00:04:40.331 --> 00:04:43.000
<v Speaker 1>You can get the iphone five for 260 </v>
<v Speaker 1>bucks.</v>

90
00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.910
<v Speaker 1>That's ridiculous folks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's cheap.</v>

91
00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.350
<v Speaker 1>It's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's awesome.</v>

92
00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.200
<v Speaker 1>And they have been a sponsor of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast for a long time.</v>

93
00:04:50.201 --> 00:04:52.930
<v Speaker 1>So if you were in the market for a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>cell phone,</v>

<v Speaker 1>We got a lot of interesting stuff to </v>

98
00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:08.280
<v Speaker 1>talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>

99
00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:13.230
<v Speaker 1>we have a very special guest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cue The music Camp Jamie and I'll </v>

100
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.230
<v Speaker 1>introduce him to the world,</v>

101
00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.510
<v Speaker 1>the Joe Rogan experience</v>

102
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:23.720
<v Speaker 2>Joe Rogan podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have.</v>

103
00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:30.780
<v Speaker 1>Is it okay to call you the Godfather?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Please do the godfather here.</v>

104
00:05:30.781 --> 00:05:35.781
<v Speaker 1>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is in reference to a music </v>

105
00:05:35.781 --> 00:05:38.310
<v Speaker 1>video that you were a part of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>

106
00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:39.970
<v Speaker 1>How do I say your last name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sat.</v>

107
00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.960
<v Speaker 1>Just sat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fine.</v>

108
00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:43.110
<v Speaker 1>Cad side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's two a's.</v>

109
00:05:43.111 --> 00:05:48.111
<v Speaker 1>It gets tricky when this next phase </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's a guttural sound from </v>

110
00:05:48.111 --> 00:05:48.111
<v Speaker 1>Arabic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

111
00:05:48.111 --> 00:05:49.050
<v Speaker 1>how will you say it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Side side.</v>

112
00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:51.750
<v Speaker 1>But since most westerners couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>pronounce that,</v>

113
00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.610
<v Speaker 1>you just do the AA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

114
00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:56.190
<v Speaker 1>that's got to be annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where this.</v>

115
00:05:56.191 --> 00:05:57.860
<v Speaker 1>We're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we gentrify everything.</v>

116
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.370
<v Speaker 3>We push everything down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

117
00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:05.980
<v Speaker 3>you are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are an expert in evolutionary </v>

118
00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:09.581
<v Speaker 3>psychology and in this is where rick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really fascinating evolutionary </v>

119
00:06:09.581 --> 00:06:12.530
<v Speaker 3>psychology and its effect on </v>
<v Speaker 3>consumerism,</v>

120
00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:18.010
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I basically apply a evolutionary </v>

121
00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:18.500
<v Speaker 3>psychology on this time that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>consumed with Tori nature.</v>

122
00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:22.490
<v Speaker 3>What are the biological forces that can </v>
<v Speaker 3>pedal us to be the consumers that we are</v>

123
00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.970
<v Speaker 3>defined consumption very broadly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not just consuming Coca Cola,</v>

124
00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.460
<v Speaker 3>but we consume friendships,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we consume religion,</v>

125
00:06:28.461 --> 00:06:32.060
<v Speaker 3>we consume marriages.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's a consumption with a capital c.</v>

126
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:35.020
<v Speaker 3>that's fascinating to me because you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

127
00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:38.730
<v Speaker 3>we have these general definitions that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we use in,</v>

128
00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:39.830
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in culture.</v>

129
00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:45.760
<v Speaker 3>And one of them is consumerism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Consumerism almost always pertains to </v>

130
00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.870
<v Speaker 3>buying things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what you're looking at it.</v>

131
00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:51.760
<v Speaker 3>And as I like that better because it is </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of what we do.</v>

132
00:06:51.761 --> 00:06:54.020
<v Speaker 3>We do consume relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't want exactly.</v>

133
00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:56.000
<v Speaker 3>I mean we consume cultural products,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

134
00:06:56.001 --> 00:06:59.900
<v Speaker 3>So why is it that certain songs are so </v>
<v Speaker 3>appealing to us?</v>

135
00:06:59.901 --> 00:07:00.290
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

136
00:07:00.291 --> 00:07:03.500
<v Speaker 3>what are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is it about song lyrics that are,</v>

137
00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:07.880
<v Speaker 3>that trigger an emotional pull us why </v>
<v Speaker 3>our movies appealing?</v>

138
00:07:07.881 --> 00:07:12.881
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you study these sculptural products </v>

139
00:07:12.881 --> 00:07:14.981
<v Speaker 3>because they say something really about </v>
<v Speaker 3>the evolution of the human mind that's </v>

140
00:07:14.981 --> 00:07:18.820
<v Speaker 3>do you study songs that are annoying as </v>
<v Speaker 3>well because I've always wondered why </v>

141
00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:20.270
<v Speaker 3>some songs are like super appealing to </v>
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>

142
00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.880
<v Speaker 3>but then just infuriating to other </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

143
00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:26.000
<v Speaker 3>So that would probably be a musicologist</v>
<v Speaker 3>who would study the,</v>

144
00:07:26.001 --> 00:07:29.480
<v Speaker 3>the musical structure of songs to know </v>
<v Speaker 3>what makes them appealing or not.</v>

145
00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:33.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm specifically looking at the lyrics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>

146
00:07:33.051 --> 00:07:38.051
<v Speaker 3>if you look at hip hop videos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're wonderful Darwinian laboratory </v>

147
00:07:38.051 --> 00:07:42.221
<v Speaker 3>because all the political correctness is</v>
<v Speaker 3>cut out and basically your real </v>

148
00:07:42.221 --> 00:07:43.550
<v Speaker 3>Darwinian being shines through,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

149
00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:46.280
<v Speaker 3>So men are going to signal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

150
00:07:46.281 --> 00:07:48.020
<v Speaker 3>I've got the Missouri Audi,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got the Porsche,</v>

151
00:07:48.021 --> 00:07:49.190
<v Speaker 3>get with me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

152
00:07:49.191 --> 00:07:50.830
<v Speaker 3>women are going to signal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

153
00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:52.430
<v Speaker 3>beauty markers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's only women,</v>

154
00:07:52.431 --> 00:07:57.431
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who denigrate men if they have low </v>

155
00:07:57.431 --> 00:07:57.431
<v Speaker 3>social status,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

156
00:07:57.431 --> 00:07:58.040
<v Speaker 3>It's never going to be a guy saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey Linda,</v>

157
00:07:58.041 --> 00:08:01.430
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't work hard enough so you're not</v>

158
00:08:01.431 --> 00:08:03.380
<v Speaker 3>ambitious enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to have sex with you.</v>

159
00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:06.230
<v Speaker 3>But the other way around you see a </v>
<v Speaker 3>million songs like that,</v>

160
00:08:06.231 --> 00:08:07.220
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

161
00:08:07.221 --> 00:08:08.420
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All you know,</v>

162
00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:11.090
<v Speaker 3>like she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's not a gold digger,</v>

163
00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:15.020
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's very interesting.</v>

164
00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:17.690
<v Speaker 3>I'm a musicologist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that a real person?</v>

165
00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:19.520
<v Speaker 3>A real person?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

166
00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:22.360
<v Speaker 3>That's a musicologist would study lyrics</v>
<v Speaker 3>and dope and.</v>

167
00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:27.550
<v Speaker 3>Well they would probably study that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The structure structure of the musical </v>

168
00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:27.550
<v Speaker 3>notes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

169
00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:27.920
<v Speaker 3>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

170
00:08:27.921 --> 00:08:32.921
<v Speaker 3>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what types of notes are innately </v>

171
00:08:32.921 --> 00:08:32.921
<v Speaker 3>appealing to people.</v>

172
00:08:32.921 --> 00:08:33.440
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that,</v>

173
00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:34.920
<v Speaker 3>that's certainly not what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

174
00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:39.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking only at song lyrics as one </v>
<v Speaker 3>of many types of cultural products.</v>

175
00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:42.950
<v Speaker 3>The lyrics would be the thing that would</v>
<v Speaker 3>be annoying to most though.</v>

176
00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:48.410
<v Speaker 3>I mean that would be the thing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>would really try them out as being </v>

177
00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:48.410
<v Speaker 3>annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like some inane,</v>

178
00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:49.460
<v Speaker 3>retarded songs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They love Taylor swift.</v>

179
00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:51.170
<v Speaker 3>What you said it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not me.</v>

180
00:08:51.171 --> 00:08:54.700
<v Speaker 3>How dare you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how dare you suffered?</v>

181
00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:58.440
<v Speaker 3>I know one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you date Terrell's swift,</v>

182
00:08:58.441 --> 00:09:03.441
<v Speaker 3>you're a fucking idiot because that shit</v>
<v Speaker 3>will write songs about you for the end </v>

183
00:09:03.441 --> 00:09:04.680
<v Speaker 3>of time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's got whole books about John Mayer.</v>

184
00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:05.870
<v Speaker 3>Is that his name?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Aaron Meyer.</v>

185
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:09.110
<v Speaker 3>I always say it wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>John Mayer chicks copy books on that.</v>

186
00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:12.080
<v Speaker 3>So that's unfair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine that.</v>

187
00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:14.700
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so your,</v>

188
00:09:14.701 --> 00:09:18.810
<v Speaker 3>your thing would be more along the lines</v>
<v Speaker 3>of studying,</v>

189
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:22.260
<v Speaker 3>like why people are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why they find it appealing,</v>

190
00:09:22.261 --> 00:09:27.261
<v Speaker 3>like the rap type song,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why they find it appealing like Taylor </v>

191
00:09:27.261 --> 00:09:27.261
<v Speaker 3>swift,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the contents of those songs,</v>

192
00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:32.130
<v Speaker 3>if you take a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a ancient Greek poem,</v>

193
00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:32.760
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

194
00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:36.210
<v Speaker 3>We still studied at university today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>3000 years later,</v>

195
00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:41.540
<v Speaker 3>precisely because that poem is going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>speak to certain realities,</v>

196
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.680
<v Speaker 3>sibling rivalry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>status,</v>

197
00:09:43.681 --> 00:09:46.240
<v Speaker 3>competition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>parental conflicts with,</v>

198
00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:50.460
<v Speaker 3>with their offspring,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a paternal uncertainty.</v>

199
00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:54.120
<v Speaker 3>All of these factors as what makes </v>
<v Speaker 3>literature interesting.</v>

200
00:09:54.121 --> 00:09:59.121
<v Speaker 3>So we could study those ancient Greek </v>
<v Speaker 3>poems today and still address updates </v>

201
00:09:59.121 --> 00:10:03.090
<v Speaker 3>with us precisely because they are </v>
<v Speaker 3>speaking about some universal truths.</v>

202
00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:04.780
<v Speaker 3>That is amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

203
00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:09.800
<v Speaker 3>That stuff from 3,300</v>
<v Speaker 3>plus years ago is still studied on a </v>

204
00:10:10.051 --> 00:10:15.051
<v Speaker 3>daily basis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but some books from like 50 years ago </v>

205
00:10:15.051 --> 00:10:15.051
<v Speaker 3>gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

206
00:10:15.051 --> 00:10:16.590
<v Speaker 3>That's got to be frustrating as hell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're a writer,</v>

207
00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:18.390
<v Speaker 3>if you're an author and you're just </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

208
00:10:18.391 --> 00:10:21.630
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That guy is so overrated.</v>

209
00:10:21.631 --> 00:10:24.630
<v Speaker 3>I'm so tired of Ealing hearing about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

210
00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.730
<v Speaker 3>aristotle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>aristotle,</v>

211
00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:28.140
<v Speaker 3>go fuck yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bro.</v>

212
00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:33.380
<v Speaker 3>That shit was so long ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You didn't know anything or they knew a </v>

213
00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:33.380
<v Speaker 3>lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't know a lot of.</v>

214
00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:35.340
<v Speaker 3>Certainly knew the mysteries of human </v>
<v Speaker 3>nature.</v>

215
00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:40.640
<v Speaker 3>I'm fascinated by that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am absolutely fascinated by what was </v>

216
00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:44.511
<v Speaker 3>going on thousands and thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago and like what was the mindset </v>

217
00:10:44.511 --> 00:10:49.011
<v Speaker 3>and communication with those people and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can kind of pull a little bit of it </v>

218
00:10:49.011 --> 00:10:49.620
<v Speaker 3>out of the writing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but man,</v>

219
00:10:49.621 --> 00:10:54.621
<v Speaker 3>if I could go back in time to some.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it would have to be a culture </v>

220
00:10:54.621 --> 00:10:55.980
<v Speaker 3>obviously that speaks English where it </v>
<v Speaker 3>could understand what they're saying,</v>

221
00:10:55.981 --> 00:10:59.730
<v Speaker 3>but I think that would be incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 3>fascinating to go back three or 4,000</v>

222
00:10:59.731 --> 00:11:04.731
<v Speaker 3>years ago and communicate with people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just try to figure out how they see the </v>

223
00:11:04.731 --> 00:11:04.731
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

224
00:11:04.731 --> 00:11:09.470
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people are very stuck on </v>

225
00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:09.470
<v Speaker 3>identifying cultural differences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

226
00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:13.820
<v Speaker 3>So the French eat this type of food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Malaysians do this type of dance </v>

227
00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:17.690
<v Speaker 3>and.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what they miss is that underneath </v>

228
00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:19.821
<v Speaker 3>all of these important cross cultural </v>
<v Speaker 3>differences is this bedrock of human </v>

229
00:11:19.821 --> 00:11:22.620
<v Speaker 3>universals that make us a lot more </v>
<v Speaker 3>similar than different from one another.</v>

230
00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:28.220
<v Speaker 3>And especially in the social sciences </v>
<v Speaker 3>where people are really focused on just </v>

231
00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:29.520
<v Speaker 3>identifying differences,</v>
<v Speaker 3>differences,</v>

232
00:11:29.521 --> 00:11:31.890
<v Speaker 3>differences,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but of course there are also things that</v>

233
00:11:31.891 --> 00:11:33.720
<v Speaker 3>are so common so that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

234
00:11:33.721 --> 00:11:36.240
<v Speaker 3>beauty markets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are certain beauty markers that if</v>

235
00:11:36.241 --> 00:11:39.240
<v Speaker 3>I went to the Yanomami tribe in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Amazon,</v>

236
00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:41.940
<v Speaker 3>they're going to find exactly the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>

237
00:11:41.941 --> 00:11:45.930
<v Speaker 3>attractive and the beautiful girls in </v>
<v Speaker 3>rap videos as you and I would.</v>

238
00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:50.580
<v Speaker 3>And that's because those beauty markers </v>
<v Speaker 3>are evolutionary markers and so yes,</v>

239
00:11:50.581 --> 00:11:55.581
<v Speaker 3>culture matters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody denies the fact that the culture </v>

240
00:11:55.581 --> 00:11:58.110
<v Speaker 3>important,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but underneath these cultural </v>

241
00:11:58.110 --> 00:11:58.270
<v Speaker 3>differences is a biological,</v>
<v Speaker 3>biological heritage that makes you and I</v>

242
00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:00.340
<v Speaker 3>are very similar to one another.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>

243
00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:03.790
<v Speaker 3>what changes over time that makes beauty</v>
<v Speaker 3>markers differently?</v>

244
00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:08.830
<v Speaker 3>Like I've always been fascinated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like if you look at the renaissance </v>

245
00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:08.830
<v Speaker 3>paintings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the women were very.</v>

246
00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:13.020
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't even call them voluptuous </v>

247
00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:13.020
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

248
00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:13.330
<v Speaker 3>They're overweight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ruben Ruben asked like they eat a lot of</v>

249
00:12:13.331 --> 00:12:15.820
<v Speaker 3>Ruben's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is she even asked me?</v>

250
00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:20.880
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's rubin was a painter who was </v>

251
00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:23.371
<v Speaker 3>particularly had a pension for drawing </v>
<v Speaker 3>these voluptuous women who was a fatty </v>

252
00:12:23.371 --> 00:12:25.290
<v Speaker 3>chaser.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a bit of a fatty chase.</v>

253
00:12:25.291 --> 00:12:30.291
<v Speaker 3>Ruined that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I must say this is the first time that </v>

254
00:12:30.291 --> 00:12:30.790
<v Speaker 3>I've held an interview where fatty </v>
<v Speaker 3>chaser has come up,</v>

255
00:12:30.791 --> 00:12:31.750
<v Speaker 3>so thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

256
00:12:31.751 --> 00:12:35.000
<v Speaker 3>you need to be involved in more </v>
<v Speaker 3>podcasting because fatty taste.</v>

257
00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:38.200
<v Speaker 3>It's important to say now that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>fat shaming,</v>

258
00:12:38.201 --> 00:12:43.201
<v Speaker 3>that's the newest thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you follow these ultra super </v>

259
00:12:43.201 --> 00:12:46.030
<v Speaker 3>sensitive terms and their evolution?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You said we've got up to three hours.</v>

260
00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:47.920
<v Speaker 3>I could talk about this for about 30 </v>
<v Speaker 3>hours.</v>

261
00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:52.960
<v Speaker 3>Poly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually went recently to a and we </v>

262
00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:52.960
<v Speaker 3>come back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll come back to the rubin,</v>

263
00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:57.040
<v Speaker 3>so we'll come back to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I recently gave a talk at Wellesley </v>

264
00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:58.830
<v Speaker 3>College,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all women's college women's college data</v>

265
00:12:58.840 --> 00:12:59.590
<v Speaker 3>chicken went there.</v>

266
00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:01.650
<v Speaker 3>Is that right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Times are rough.</v>

267
00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:03.050
<v Speaker 3>Tough time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It.</v>

268
00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:04.640
<v Speaker 3>Taylor swift.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

269
00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:09.850
<v Speaker 3>it was a gal who did not shave her legs </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it was patriarchal to beautify </v>

270
00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:10.840
<v Speaker 3>yourself there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

271
00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:12.310
<v Speaker 3>she can pull it off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was blonde,</v>

272
00:13:12.311 --> 00:13:14.560
<v Speaker 3>but whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Her roommate was a Hobbit,</v>

273
00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:17.820
<v Speaker 3>showed hairy feet old thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but hey,</v>

274
00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:18.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

275
00:13:18.821 --> 00:13:20.410
<v Speaker 3>It's just cultural norms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

276
00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:25.440
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I give a talk there under this thing </v>

277
00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:27.760
<v Speaker 3>called the freedom project,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which tries to promote sort of iconic,</v>

278
00:13:27.761 --> 00:13:32.761
<v Speaker 3>classic ideas that kind of break the </v>
<v Speaker 3>shackles of political correctness and </v>

279
00:13:32.761 --> 00:13:36.951
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was just amazing that kind of stuff </v>

280
00:13:36.951 --> 00:13:39.121
<v Speaker 3>that was happening there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'll just give you one or two </v>

281
00:13:39.121 --> 00:13:39.121
<v Speaker 3>examples.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A,</v>

282
00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:44.610
<v Speaker 3>apparently it was a form of oppression </v>
<v Speaker 3>to assume for a professor to assume that</v>

283
00:13:46.451 --> 00:13:51.250
<v Speaker 3>when he meets students he right away </v>
<v Speaker 3>categorizes them as either being male or</v>

284
00:13:51.251 --> 00:13:52.480
<v Speaker 3>female.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>

285
00:13:52.481 --> 00:13:55.690
<v Speaker 3>if I see you in my class and I say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey sir,</v>

286
00:13:56.860 --> 00:14:01.860
<v Speaker 3>while the law,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that would be a form of oppression </v>

287
00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:04.531
<v Speaker 3>because I'm assuming based on your outer</v>
<v Speaker 3>markers that you are male rather than </v>

288
00:14:04.531 --> 00:14:08.881
<v Speaker 3>what I should do is sort of do a quick </v>
<v Speaker 3>polling of each person in terms of how </v>

289
00:14:10.571 --> 00:14:11.770
<v Speaker 3>they'd like to be addressed.</v>

290
00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:15.530
<v Speaker 3>So you may be biologically male but you </v>
<v Speaker 3>are a gender,</v>

291
00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:17.260
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>transgender,</v>

292
00:14:17.261 --> 00:14:18.730
<v Speaker 3>you'd be queer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can be queer,</v>

293
00:14:18.731 --> 00:14:20.080
<v Speaker 3>you can be this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So as you know,</v>

294
00:14:20.081 --> 00:14:23.480
<v Speaker 3>facebook has 50 markers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the 50,</v>

295
00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:24.610
<v Speaker 3>there's 55,</v>
<v Speaker 3>zero,</v>

296
00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:26.300
<v Speaker 3>zero.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could only,</v>

297
00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:29.240
<v Speaker 3>I could 10,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

298
00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:31.450
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fifty 50.</v>

299
00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:33.940
<v Speaker 3>And for folks who don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>queer is not a slur.</v>

300
00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:35.320
<v Speaker 3>When I'm saying Queer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

301
00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:37.630
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying it like that.</v>

302
00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:42.810
<v Speaker 3>Queer is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they do not want to be interpreted as </v>

303
00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:45.730
<v Speaker 3>male or female.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want to be just whatever they are.</v>

304
00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:50.760
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so now you have at universities of </v>

305
00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:53.180
<v Speaker 3>discussion as to whether you should have</v>
<v Speaker 3>not male and female bathrooms,</v>

306
00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:55.700
<v Speaker 3>but you should have gender neutral </v>
<v Speaker 3>bathrooms.</v>

307
00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:57.410
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so on and so forth.</v>

308
00:14:57.411 --> 00:15:00.730
<v Speaker 3>And so on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Academia and the world that I reside in,</v>

309
00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:01.440
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

310
00:15:01.441 --> 00:15:03.500
<v Speaker 3>it's there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is it getting so squirrely?</v>

311
00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:04.130
<v Speaker 3>What's going on?</v>

312
00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:06.200
<v Speaker 3>Are we too soft?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do we have to hunt for our own food?</v>

313
00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:11.300
<v Speaker 3>Do we have to deal with the winter more?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do we have to like chop wood to keep </v>

314
00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:15.671
<v Speaker 3>warm?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is making us concentrate on these </v>

315
00:15:15.671 --> 00:15:18.401
<v Speaker 3>frivolous matters of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not just a politically correct </v>

316
00:15:18.401 --> 00:15:22.331
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like it's coddling the most </v>

317
00:15:22.331 --> 00:15:24.740
<v Speaker 3>ridiculously over-sensitive notions that</v>
<v Speaker 3>human beings have ever constructed.</v>

318
00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:29.890
<v Speaker 3>I think we've been parameterized by an </v>
<v Speaker 3>astonishing farm of political </v>

319
00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:30.700
<v Speaker 3>correctness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean what [inaudible] like,</v>

320
00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:32.020
<v Speaker 3>like a parasite that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

321
00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:37.220
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in the same way that I like that </v>

322
00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:37.980
<v Speaker 3>word,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that viruses can enter your body,</v>

323
00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:43.410
<v Speaker 3>a virus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's of the mind can also take over </v>

324
00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:43.410
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your.</v>

325
00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:45.980
<v Speaker 3>I mean religion is an example of a Mima </v>
<v Speaker 3>plex form of.</v>

326
00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:48.170
<v Speaker 3>I mean some people would be upset by </v>
<v Speaker 3>what I'm saying,</v>

327
00:15:48.171 --> 00:15:51.200
<v Speaker 3>but a form of parasite that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>rewires your thinking.</v>

328
00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:56.700
<v Speaker 3>So political correctness is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an astonishing form of parasitic </v>

329
00:15:57.171 --> 00:16:02.171
<v Speaker 3>thinking where everything is viewed </v>
<v Speaker 3>through the lens of I should not offend </v>

330
00:16:02.171 --> 00:16:07.151
<v Speaker 3>anyone and so common sense and just </v>
<v Speaker 3>reason goes out the window and the </v>

331
00:16:07.151 --> 00:16:08.090
<v Speaker 3>pursuit of non offense.</v>

332
00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:10.190
<v Speaker 3>You know what though I have an issue </v>
<v Speaker 3>with it,</v>

333
00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:13.700
<v Speaker 3>that most people who practice this in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the extreme form,</v>

334
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.020
<v Speaker 3>they say that they should not offend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know who they offend,</v>

335
00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:23.050
<v Speaker 3>they offend anyone who does not agree </v>
<v Speaker 3>with their notion that you should not </v>

336
00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:26.441
<v Speaker 3>offend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They will be violent and angry and </v>

337
00:16:26.441 --> 00:16:29.291
<v Speaker 3>fucking incredibly insulting to people </v>
<v Speaker 3>who do not agree with their,</v>

338
00:16:29.661 --> 00:16:34.661
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their terms of what is a fence and </v>

339
00:16:34.661 --> 00:16:35.440
<v Speaker 3>what's not offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have been some of the Ma,</v>

340
00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:40.540
<v Speaker 3>meanest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nastiest things had been said to me by </v>

341
00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:43.271
<v Speaker 3>people who claim to be a in this sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>ultra sensitive super open minded </v>

342
00:16:44.751 --> 00:16:49.751
<v Speaker 3>category,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is quite fascinating to me that </v>

343
00:16:49.751 --> 00:16:49.880
<v Speaker 3>you're exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll give you a fantastic quote.</v>

344
00:16:49.881 --> 00:16:51.020
<v Speaker 3>I might be paraphrasing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like that.</v>

345
00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:56.030
<v Speaker 3>I think it's Thomas Soul A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm an economist who basically was </v>

346
00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:58.370
<v Speaker 3>criticizing so-called diversity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>

347
00:16:58.371 --> 00:17:03.371
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so at American universities or in </v>

348
00:17:03.371 --> 00:17:03.371
<v Speaker 3>western universities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody talks about diversity,</v>

349
00:17:03.371 --> 00:17:07.961
<v Speaker 3>but the only form of diversity that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>not allowed is intellectual and </v>

350
00:17:07.961 --> 00:17:07.961
<v Speaker 3>political diversity.</v>

351
00:17:07.961 --> 00:17:08.750
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

352
00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:13.810
<v Speaker 3>so you want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We want diversity in terms of skin </v>

353
00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:15.941
<v Speaker 3>color.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We wanted diversity in terms of sexual </v>

354
00:17:15.941 --> 00:17:15.941
<v Speaker 3>orientation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We want diversity in terms of genders.</v>

355
00:17:15.941 --> 00:17:17.630
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So all forms of diversity are welcome,</v>

356
00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:23.050
<v Speaker 3>but don't you dare step out of line with</v>
<v Speaker 3>the accepted politically correct </v>

357
00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:24.590
<v Speaker 3>positions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now that's diversity that we don't want.</v>

358
00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:26.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is that?</v>

359
00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:26.990
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

360
00:17:26.991 --> 00:17:28.970
<v Speaker 3>how do they not see that thought?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Police?</v>

361
00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:31.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I face it.</v>

362
00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:33.140
<v Speaker 3>I mean eventually I guess we'll come </v>
<v Speaker 3>back to my work.</v>

363
00:17:33.141 --> 00:17:35.650
<v Speaker 3>I face it very much in my work because </v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

364
00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:40.660
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I rile up all sorts of different people </v>

365
00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:40.660
<v Speaker 3>out of the woods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the woodwork.</v>

366
00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:44.681
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>radical feminists hate my work because </v>

367
00:17:44.681 --> 00:17:44.930
<v Speaker 3>how dare you say that we are biological </v>
<v Speaker 3>beings?</v>

368
00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:46.940
<v Speaker 3>How dare you say that there are sex </v>
<v Speaker 3>differences.</v>

369
00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:51.240
<v Speaker 3>A postmodernist will hate my work </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the truth is all relative.</v>

370
00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:53.100
<v Speaker 3>There's no such thing as scientific </v>
<v Speaker 3>truth.</v>

371
00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:54.640
<v Speaker 3>It's all relative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

372
00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:58.410
<v Speaker 3>the religious folks will hate my work </v>
<v Speaker 3>because if Darwinian theory is correct,</v>

373
00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:03.420
<v Speaker 3>it is a then where is God in all this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's this long queue of people who</v>

374
00:18:03.421 --> 00:18:05.270
<v Speaker 3>will come out of the woodworks to </v>
<v Speaker 3>criticize you.</v>

375
00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:07.930
<v Speaker 3>Not for any valid scientific reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but because they,</v>

376
00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:09.870
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it shakes their ideological beliefs.</v>

377
00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:15.280
<v Speaker 3>It's fascinating to me the parallels </v>
<v Speaker 3>between religious nutters and </v>

378
00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:17.250
<v Speaker 3>politically correct nutters because it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>very similar in a lot of ways that their</v>

379
00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:21.990
<v Speaker 3>ideology is just so cemented in their </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness.</v>

380
00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:25.290
<v Speaker 3>More bile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's rock solid.</v>

381
00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:27.330
<v Speaker 3>It's not going anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you disagree,</v>

382
00:18:27.331 --> 00:18:30.440
<v Speaker 3>you patriarchal piece of shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

383
00:18:30.441 --> 00:18:34.260
<v Speaker 3>male fucking suppressor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you horrible thing.</v>

384
00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:37.090
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's quite fascinating if,</v>

385
00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:38.390
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there aren't,</v>

386
00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:40.140
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they're not differences,</v>

387
00:18:40.141 --> 00:18:45.141
<v Speaker 3>any differences in the sexist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do they use these radical </v>

388
00:18:45.141 --> 00:18:48.411
<v Speaker 3>feminists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do they use to define the reason </v>

389
00:18:48.411 --> 00:18:49.370
<v Speaker 3>why humans have such varying behavior </v>
<v Speaker 3>between the male and female gender?</v>

390
00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:52.770
<v Speaker 3>Are you ready for this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything.</v>

391
00:18:52.771 --> 00:18:55.920
<v Speaker 3>Short of genitalia is a social </v>
<v Speaker 3>construction,</v>

392
00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:58.200
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So even for example,</v>

393
00:18:58.201 --> 00:19:03.201
<v Speaker 3>the fact that Baba grew up to be a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a block center for the University of </v>

394
00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:11.270
<v Speaker 3>Oklahoma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and hence he could bench press 500 </v>

395
00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:11.270
<v Speaker 3>pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not due to,</v>

396
00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:14.990
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any physiological reasons that he is so </v>

397
00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:17.421
<v Speaker 3>strong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's because what happened is his </v>

398
00:19:17.421 --> 00:19:17.421
<v Speaker 3>parents,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

399
00:19:17.421 --> 00:19:20.640
<v Speaker 3>aggressively nurtured rough tumble play.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas for girls,</v>

400
00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:26.030
<v Speaker 3>they told them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen to them that you should not be </v>

401
00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:28.311
<v Speaker 3>playing so rough and that then either </v>
<v Speaker 3>gives the green light or the red light </v>

402
00:19:28.311 --> 00:19:29.910
<v Speaker 3>to express your physicality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's insane.</v>

403
00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:33.350
<v Speaker 3>That's absolutely insane that that idea </v>
<v Speaker 3>is insane.</v>

404
00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:38.430
<v Speaker 3>That there's not a difference in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>physiological properties of the bodies </v>

405
00:19:38.551 --> 00:19:43.551
<v Speaker 3>of men and women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the biological differences are </v>

406
00:19:43.551 --> 00:19:43.920
<v Speaker 3>scientific.</v>
<v Speaker 3>While they are there.</v>

407
00:19:43.921 --> 00:19:45.270
<v Speaker 3>There are some feminists and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

408
00:19:45.271 --> 00:19:50.271
<v Speaker 3>I'm paraphrasing the quote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll say there's no such thing as a </v>

409
00:19:50.271 --> 00:19:53.691
<v Speaker 3>male or female brain as there is no such</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing as a male or female pancreas or </v>

410
00:19:53.691 --> 00:19:53.691
<v Speaker 3>liver.</v>

411
00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:54.750
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

412
00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:59.520
<v Speaker 3>so the Oregon that defines your </v>
<v Speaker 3>personhood is actually gender neutral.</v>

413
00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:04.730
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is astonishing because we are a </v>

414
00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:06.501
<v Speaker 3>sexually reproducing species,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so one of the foundational tenants on </v>

415
00:20:06.501 --> 00:20:10.521
<v Speaker 3>which biological understanding happens </v>
<v Speaker 3>is that we have two types of </v>

416
00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:13.590
<v Speaker 3>polymorphisms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you'd like to type,</v>

417
00:20:13.591 --> 00:20:16.200
<v Speaker 3>we have a male and a female so that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>could sexually reproduce.</v>

418
00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:19.680
<v Speaker 3>So the idea that much of this as social </v>
<v Speaker 3>reconstruction,</v>

419
00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:21.840
<v Speaker 3>this social construction is just </v>
<v Speaker 3>laughable.</v>

420
00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:24.510
<v Speaker 3>I think it comes though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean just to be fair to them,</v>

421
00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:29.430
<v Speaker 3>I think it originally comes from a </v>
<v Speaker 3>desire to fight sex,</v>

422
00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:34.490
<v Speaker 3>institutionalized sexism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what happens is that they mix </v>

423
00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:37.200
<v Speaker 3>equality under the law as being </v>
<v Speaker 3>indistinguishable beings,</v>

424
00:20:37.201 --> 00:20:42.201
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We we could be different beings yet we </v>

425
00:20:42.201 --> 00:20:44.130
<v Speaker 3>should be equal under the law,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they argued that if you admit to the</v>

426
00:20:44.131 --> 00:20:48.370
<v Speaker 3>fact that we are different than that </v>
<v Speaker 3>makes it easier for the status</v>

427
00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:49.210
<v Speaker 4>quo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sexist,</v>

428
00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:53.620
<v Speaker 4>patriarchy to maintain it's privileged </v>
<v Speaker 4>position and so they create this edifice</v>

429
00:20:53.621 --> 00:20:58.621
<v Speaker 4>of the past 50 to 100 years of social </v>
<v Speaker 4>science research that is completely </v>

430
00:20:58.721 --> 00:21:03.721
<v Speaker 4>laughable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that they hang onto like religious </v>

431
00:21:03.721 --> 00:21:03.721
<v Speaker 4>beliefs.</v>

432
00:21:03.721 --> 00:21:07.200
<v Speaker 1>It's so fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a woman that has a video </v>

433
00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:09.951
<v Speaker 1>online on youtube where she claimed that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is no difference in the physical </v>

434
00:21:09.951 --> 00:21:14.181
<v Speaker 1>strength of men and women and it's just </v>
<v Speaker 1>that men have been encouraged to engage </v>

435
00:21:14.181 --> 00:21:16.260
<v Speaker 1>in weightlifting and all these different</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that women did the same thing.</v>

436
00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:19.230
<v Speaker 1>They'd be just as strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is insane.</v>

437
00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:24.740
<v Speaker 1>It's so insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have 10 times more testosterone than </v>

438
00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:24.740
<v Speaker 1>women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that a social construction?</v>

439
00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:29.510
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also insane because women who are </v>

440
00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:32.271
<v Speaker 1>athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>women who are elite world class </v>

441
00:21:32.271 --> 00:21:35.511
<v Speaker 1>athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they compare their hand strength to </v>

442
00:21:35.511 --> 00:21:35.970
<v Speaker 1>men who don't even exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>men are stronger.</v>

443
00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:39.000
<v Speaker 1>Just the ability to grab things and grip</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

444
00:21:39.001 --> 00:21:44.001
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was an issue where there was a </v>

445
00:21:44.001 --> 00:21:46.311
<v Speaker 1>woman who is a transgender,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she became a transgender woman and she </v>

446
00:21:46.311 --> 00:21:50.421
<v Speaker 1>used to be a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was a man for 30 years and then she </v>

447
00:21:50.421 --> 00:21:50.421
<v Speaker 1>didn't tell anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>start fighting women and women's mma and</v>

448
00:21:50.421 --> 00:21:51.120
<v Speaker 1>I was furious.</v>

449
00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:56.120
<v Speaker 1>I went crazy about it and I got so much </v>
<v Speaker 1>hate from people that were calling me </v>

450
00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:57.410
<v Speaker 1>transphobic because you're transforming </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm like,</v>

451
00:21:57.570 --> 00:22:00.120
<v Speaker 1>that's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't understand.</v>

452
00:22:00.121 --> 00:22:03.360
<v Speaker 1>There's a difference in the male frame.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a difference in the shape of the</v>

453
00:22:03.361 --> 00:22:04.680
<v Speaker 1>hips,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dye,</v>

454
00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:06.450
<v Speaker 1>the mechanics of the short,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like everything.</v>

455
00:22:06.451 --> 00:22:09.030
<v Speaker 1>The whole body is built different and </v>
<v Speaker 1>not only that,</v>

456
00:22:09.031 --> 00:22:13.260
<v Speaker 1>the fact that it takes 30 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're 30 years of being a man with</v>

457
00:22:13.261 --> 00:22:18.261
<v Speaker 1>full testosterone and then it takes like</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 years before your bone density even </v>

458
00:22:18.261 --> 00:22:22.761
<v Speaker 1>starts decreasing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they wanted to make it so it's </v>

459
00:22:22.761 --> 00:22:25.551
<v Speaker 1>completely indistinguishable and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>also have support from transgender </v>

460
00:22:25.551 --> 00:22:30.231
<v Speaker 1>surgeons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is quite fascinating and </v>

461
00:22:30.231 --> 00:22:32.661
<v Speaker 1>completely biased.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These transgender surgeons who want to </v>

462
00:22:32.661 --> 00:22:36.021
<v Speaker 1>or reassignment doctors and they want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretend that their exact equals </v>

463
00:22:37.050 --> 00:22:38.380
<v Speaker 1>physiologically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got.</v>

464
00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:43.570
<v Speaker 4>Sorry on that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So in my first book I talk about John </v>

465
00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:47.500
<v Speaker 4>Money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who was a very famous psychologist at </v>

466
00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:50.291
<v Speaker 4>Johns Hopkins,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really around maybe the fifties to </v>

467
00:22:50.291 --> 00:22:53.531
<v Speaker 4>seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was a big gender theorists who </v>

468
00:22:53.531 --> 00:22:56.291
<v Speaker 4>basically argued that everything is due </v>
<v Speaker 4>to socialization so that when surgeons </v>

469
00:22:56.291 --> 00:23:00.470
<v Speaker 4>would go see him because they had to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>gender reassignment either,</v>

470
00:23:00.471 --> 00:23:02.600
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say at a circumcision,</v>

471
00:23:02.601 --> 00:23:07.601
<v Speaker 4>you in the rare case where you botch the</v>
<v Speaker 4>circumcision and now you have a problem </v>

472
00:23:07.601 --> 00:23:10.010
<v Speaker 4>in terms of having a functioning penis </v>
<v Speaker 4>or if you have,</v>

473
00:23:10.011 --> 00:23:11.150
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a condition,</v>

474
00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:15.110
<v Speaker 4>a micro penis where you're unlikely to </v>
<v Speaker 4>be a functioning mail when you grow up,</v>

475
00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:18.320
<v Speaker 4>while he would say don't worry about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just have the surgery,</v>

476
00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:23.500
<v Speaker 4>put a dress on the kid and raised him as</v>
<v Speaker 4>a girl and they'd be absolutely no </v>

477
00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:25.730
<v Speaker 4>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And of course the reality is that that's</v>

478
00:23:25.731 --> 00:23:29.180
<v Speaker 4>not how biological sex is determined.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the most famous cases,</v>

479
00:23:29.181 --> 00:23:34.181
<v Speaker 4>David Reimer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who was one of his patients who after </v>

480
00:23:34.181 --> 00:23:34.181
<v Speaker 4>having gone through the treatment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>committed suicide.</v>

481
00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:35.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember that case.</v>

482
00:23:35.391 --> 00:23:38.380
<v Speaker 1>So it was a fascinating story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

483
00:23:38.381 --> 00:23:40.060
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reality of,</v>

484
00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:45.270
<v Speaker 1>of what you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the more fascinating aspects of </v>

485
00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:49.111
<v Speaker 1>it is the difference between us all </v>
<v Speaker 1>being equal as human beings and being </v>

486
00:23:49.111 --> 00:23:52.040
<v Speaker 1>the same because we are not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not equal,</v>

487
00:23:52.290 --> 00:23:55.370
<v Speaker 1>we are very different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we all should be equal as far as our</v>

488
00:23:55.371 --> 00:23:56.270
<v Speaker 1>rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

489
00:23:56.510 --> 00:24:01.510
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as how we're treated by each </v>

490
00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:02.480
<v Speaker 1>other and the law and what a person can </v>
<v Speaker 1>get away with.</v>

491
00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:03.320
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

492
00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:06.290
<v Speaker 1>what keeps our society civil and kind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

493
00:24:06.291 --> 00:24:11.291
<v Speaker 1>Those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we should all have equality </v>

494
00:24:11.291 --> 00:24:11.291
<v Speaker 1>including children and old people and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone.</v>

495
00:24:11.291 --> 00:24:12.860
<v Speaker 1>Everyone should have equality in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that aspect.</v>

496
00:24:12.861 --> 00:24:15.950
<v Speaker 1>That's what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what makes a civilized caring society,</v>

497
00:24:15.951 --> 00:24:20.951
<v Speaker 1>but the idea that there's no differences</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as the other thing that we are </v>

498
00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:25.400
<v Speaker 1>equal as far as like physical strength </v>
<v Speaker 1>or as equal as far as like our wants and</v>

499
00:24:25.401 --> 00:24:26.600
<v Speaker 1>desires and needs.</v>

500
00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:31.960
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's denying hundreds of years of </v>

501
00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:35.540
<v Speaker 1>literature of the struggle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the struggle in all cultures between the</v>

502
00:24:35.541 --> 00:24:40.100
<v Speaker 1>male trying to understand the female,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the female trying to understand the male</v>

503
00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:45.130
<v Speaker 1>were completely alien to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We exist amongst each other when we </v>

504
00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:46.730
<v Speaker 1>gather information over a long period of</v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

505
00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:52.030
<v Speaker 1>but then we say ridiculous things like </v>
<v Speaker 1>here's one of the things that people </v>

506
00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:52.030
<v Speaker 1>love to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>happy wife,</v>

507
00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:52.900
<v Speaker 1>happy life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

508
00:24:53.150 --> 00:24:58.150
<v Speaker 1>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because make her happy and she'll stop </v>

509
00:24:58.150 --> 00:24:58.150
<v Speaker 1>screaming at you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't understand her.</v>

510
00:24:58.150 --> 00:24:59.690
<v Speaker 1>Just make her happy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do whatever she wants,</v>

511
00:24:59.691 --> 00:25:02.390
<v Speaker 1>and then she'll calm down and you'll be </v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

512
00:25:02.391 --> 00:25:04.370
<v Speaker 1>But believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't just be yourself.</v>

513
00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:09.610
<v Speaker 1>You can't just be what you want to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>and do what you want to do because </v>

514
00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:13.690
<v Speaker 1>that's going to drive her fucking crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you want to have sex with 100 </v>

515
00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:14.060
<v Speaker 1>women who want to drive 50,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>miles an hour.</v>

516
00:25:14.061 --> 00:25:16.130
<v Speaker 1>You want to disappear for weeks at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

517
00:25:16.131 --> 00:25:16.150
<v Speaker 1>I</v>

518
00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:18.450
<v Speaker 4>thought by the Patriarchy you had been </v>
<v Speaker 4>given the.</v>

519
00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:20.370
<v Speaker 4>I've been brainwashed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>brainwashed by the,</v>

520
00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:22.580
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>speaking of sexual variety,</v>

521
00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:25.310
<v Speaker 4>which is kind of a central issue in </v>
<v Speaker 4>evolutionary psychology.</v>

522
00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:30.660
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you should see some of the hate mail I </v>

523
00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:30.660
<v Speaker 4>get when I state something has been out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As you know,</v>

524
00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:35.441
<v Speaker 4>men would have evolved a greater pension</v>
<v Speaker 4>for sexual variety for terribly trivial </v>

525
00:25:35.441 --> 00:25:36.110
<v Speaker 4>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>To explain,</v>

526
00:25:36.111 --> 00:25:38.840
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean women have a think called greater</v>

527
00:25:38.841 --> 00:25:39.980
<v Speaker 4>parental investment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

528
00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:43.730
<v Speaker 4>Women on average have from from there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when the he start to,</v>

529
00:25:43.731 --> 00:25:46.910
<v Speaker 4>when they have menopause,</v>
<v Speaker 4>400 x 400 x,</v>

530
00:25:46.911 --> 00:25:51.911
<v Speaker 4>so it's a scarce resource.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Men and one ejaculation have 250 </v>

531
00:25:52.221 --> 00:25:57.221
<v Speaker 4>spermatozoa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so our gametes are very cheap and </v>

532
00:25:57.221 --> 00:26:01.961
<v Speaker 4>abundant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then of course you add the cost of </v>

533
00:26:01.961 --> 00:26:01.961
<v Speaker 4>gestation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

534
00:26:01.961 --> 00:26:05.000
<v Speaker 4>But the likelihood of having mortality </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you were giving birth.</v>

535
00:26:05.001 --> 00:26:08.990
<v Speaker 4>So for all these reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 4>women have much greater minimal parental</v>

536
00:26:08.991 --> 00:26:09.800
<v Speaker 4>obligations.</v>

537
00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:15.040
<v Speaker 4>Therefore evolutionary theory would </v>
<v Speaker 4>predict that they would be much more </v>

538
00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:17.810
<v Speaker 4>judicious when they're making a choice </v>
<v Speaker 4>because if they make a poor mate choice,</v>

539
00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:20.600
<v Speaker 4>that looms much larger for them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That on the other hand,</v>

540
00:26:20.601 --> 00:26:25.601
<v Speaker 4>for men,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the costs of making a poor mate choice </v>

541
00:26:25.601 --> 00:26:28.510
<v Speaker 4>are not as great,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the benefits of having multiple </v>

542
00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:31.151
<v Speaker 4>meeting opportunities are quite </v>
<v Speaker 4>beneficial and therefore that's why on </v>

543
00:26:31.151 --> 00:26:34.340
<v Speaker 4>average you expect men to have a much </v>
<v Speaker 4>greater pension for sexual variety.</v>

544
00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:39.550
<v Speaker 4>Now that's been documented in 17 </v>
<v Speaker 4>trillion different ways and yet you </v>

545
00:26:39.550 --> 00:26:41.810
<v Speaker 4>still have people that will send you </v>
<v Speaker 4>hate mail saying,</v>

546
00:26:41.811 --> 00:26:42.410
<v Speaker 4>Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>

547
00:26:42.411 --> 00:26:44.640
<v Speaker 4>are you a pig?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How could you promulgate</v>

548
00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:49.910
<v Speaker 3>this garbage will you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think when you're looking at human </v>

549
00:26:49.910 --> 00:26:52.410
<v Speaker 3>beings and you're talking about these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these variables,</v>

550
00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:55.860
<v Speaker 3>you're looking at it as objectively and </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientifically as possible.</v>

551
00:26:56.160 --> 00:27:01.160
<v Speaker 3>When people want that concrete world </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we've discussed this political </v>

552
00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:04.110
<v Speaker 3>correct concrete world politically </v>
<v Speaker 3>correct,</v>

553
00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:09.320
<v Speaker 3>they have this resistance to looking at </v>
<v Speaker 3>it in any way other than the way that </v>

554
00:27:10.021 --> 00:27:15.021
<v Speaker 3>they have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's completely non scientific and </v>

555
00:27:15.021 --> 00:27:15.021
<v Speaker 3>that's why it's religious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

556
00:27:15.021 --> 00:27:19.610
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's actually one of the </v>

557
00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:19.610
<v Speaker 3>criticisms that you often get about </v>
<v Speaker 3>evolutionary psychology.</v>

558
00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:21.690
<v Speaker 3>People think that you are trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>justify behaviors.</v>

559
00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:26.870
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you explain why people are likely to </v>

560
00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:27.000
<v Speaker 3>cheat and they're on their monogamous </v>
<v Speaker 3>unions,</v>

561
00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:27.900
<v Speaker 3>then they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

562
00:27:27.901 --> 00:27:32.901
<v Speaker 3>well you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're offering father to why people </v>

563
00:27:32.901 --> 00:27:32.901
<v Speaker 3>should do it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>

564
00:27:32.901 --> 00:27:36.180
<v Speaker 3>my rebuttal is I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm certainly doing no such thing.</v>

565
00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:38.970
<v Speaker 3>Similar to how an oncologist studies </v>
<v Speaker 3>cancer.</v>

566
00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.530
<v Speaker 3>He's not justifying counselor.</v>

567
00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:42.610
<v Speaker 3>He's not for cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's right.</v>

568
00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:47.630
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just explains he or she explains </v>

569
00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:48.780
<v Speaker 3>cancer and so I don't have a moral </v>
<v Speaker 3>position,</v>

570
00:27:48.781 --> 00:27:51.510
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't come to the table when I'm doing</v>

571
00:27:51.511 --> 00:27:54.030
<v Speaker 3>my scientific research hoping for one </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing or another.</v>

572
00:27:54.031 --> 00:27:56.160
<v Speaker 3>The data speaks for itself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but again,</v>

573
00:27:56.161 --> 00:28:01.161
<v Speaker 3>the ideologues will say no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if this forbidden knowledge gets </v>

574
00:28:01.161 --> 00:28:04.050
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it makes it easier for people to justify</v>

575
00:28:04.051 --> 00:28:09.051
<v Speaker 3>this behavior or that behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's absolutely fascinating to me how </v>

576
00:28:09.051 --> 00:28:13.191
<v Speaker 3>human beings react and act and so this </v>
<v Speaker 3>subject is quite near and dear to my </v>

577
00:28:13.191 --> 00:28:14.550
<v Speaker 3>heart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>

578
00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:15.990
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm.</v>

579
00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:21.190
<v Speaker 3>I'm fascinated by the cast of it all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love watching people flail and scream </v>

580
00:28:21.511 --> 00:28:24.600
<v Speaker 3>and get angry about whether it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>religious anger,</v>

581
00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:27.270
<v Speaker 3>like people who are like legitimately </v>
<v Speaker 3>Christian,</v>

582
00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:30.640
<v Speaker 3>like I love the God hates fags people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Westboro baptist.</v>

583
00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:32.880
<v Speaker 3>I don't love them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love everybody.</v>

584
00:28:32.910 --> 00:28:34.650
<v Speaker 3>In one way I would like everybody to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>nice,</v>

585
00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:39.830
<v Speaker 3>but I love the fact that they exist </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I'm absolutely fascinated by </v>

586
00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:42.951
<v Speaker 3>their folly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm absolutely fascinated by this idea </v>

587
00:28:42.951 --> 00:28:45.390
<v Speaker 3>that they have in their head that's so </v>
<v Speaker 3>concrete that they believe that soldiers</v>

588
00:28:45.391 --> 00:28:48.300
<v Speaker 3>are dying because men are being allowed </v>
<v Speaker 3>to marry other men.</v>

589
00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:53.840
<v Speaker 3>It's unbelievably weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but compelling to me and in,</v>

590
00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:56.190
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in an equal way.</v>

591
00:28:56.370 --> 00:29:01.370
<v Speaker 3>The idea that you saying that there is </v>
<v Speaker 3>some sort of an invested commitment that</v>

592
00:29:01.831 --> 00:29:06.831
<v Speaker 3>a woman has an a man does not have </v>
<v Speaker 3>objectively just looking at us as a </v>

593
00:29:06.831 --> 00:29:10.140
<v Speaker 3>biological reproducing species that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>had experienced hate because of that.</v>

594
00:29:10.141 --> 00:29:11.910
<v Speaker 3>As a scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a person,</v>

595
00:29:11.911 --> 00:29:15.120
<v Speaker 3>just analyzing data.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm amazed and I'm fascinated.</v>

596
00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:17.490
<v Speaker 3>I'm just drawn into it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't help myself.</v>

597
00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:19.410
<v Speaker 3>You want to talk about some religious </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff?</v>

598
00:29:19.530 --> 00:29:20.520
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

599
00:29:21.090 --> 00:29:22.020
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

600
00:29:22.021 --> 00:29:24.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was born in Lebanon,</v>

601
00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:25.890
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were Lebanese Jews.</v>

602
00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:27.240
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although I'm,</v>

603
00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:30.270
<v Speaker 3>I'm a non believing Jewish guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How dare you.</v>

604
00:29:30.330 --> 00:29:32.400
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know you believe in some things.</v>

605
00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:35.810
<v Speaker 3>Tell you what I believe it's science and</v>
<v Speaker 3>truth and uh,</v>

606
00:29:36.290 --> 00:29:39.570
<v Speaker 3>and so we escaped Lebanon actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>during the civil war.</v>

607
00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:42.460
<v Speaker 3>My parents in 80 were kidnapped</v>

608
00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:44.910
<v Speaker 4>by father,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the very peaceful because,</v>

609
00:29:44.911 --> 00:29:45.760
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's all peaceful.</v>

610
00:29:46.150 --> 00:29:47.860
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

611
00:29:47.861 --> 00:29:52.861
<v Speaker 4>and then after that we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've never gone back to Lebanon and so </v>

612
00:29:52.861 --> 00:29:53.110
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from a very young age,</v>

613
00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:57.760
<v Speaker 4>I think I already had sort of the innate</v>
<v Speaker 4>pension to question religious belief,</v>

614
00:29:57.761 --> 00:30:02.761
<v Speaker 4>which certainly created fiction within </v>
<v Speaker 4>my family because you should just </v>

615
00:30:02.761 --> 00:30:02.860
<v Speaker 4>believe in shut up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

616
00:30:03.390 --> 00:30:05.200
<v Speaker 4>But then when I saw the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

617
00:30:05.290 --> 00:30:09.160
<v Speaker 4>the hatred that religion in genders </v>
<v Speaker 4>firsthand,</v>

618
00:30:09.161 --> 00:30:14.161
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean facing execution as we were </v>

619
00:30:14.161 --> 00:30:14.560
<v Speaker 4>trying to escape Lebanon and then coming</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the west,</v>

620
00:30:15.250 --> 00:30:18.550
<v Speaker 4>I think I became that much more forceful</v>
<v Speaker 4>in my convictions to,</v>

621
00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:19.330
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

622
00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:24.470
<v Speaker 4>to try to combat religious dogma and of </v>
<v Speaker 4>course some of the biggest hate mail </v>

623
00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:29.161
<v Speaker 4>that you get this when you do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I've even had real professional </v>

624
00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:34.320
<v Speaker 4>situations where I've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've lost professionally because of my </v>

625
00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:34.320
<v Speaker 4>position is actually here in California.</v>

626
00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:37.780
<v Speaker 4>I've had several schools who otherwise </v>
<v Speaker 4>were very,</v>

627
00:30:37.781 --> 00:30:42.781
<v Speaker 4>very interested in making me very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very lucrative offers who after maybe </v>

628
00:30:42.781 --> 00:30:47.011
<v Speaker 4>doing a bit of due diligence on me and </v>
<v Speaker 4>seeing that I'd written stuff that was </v>

629
00:30:47.011 --> 00:30:48.520
<v Speaker 4>critical of religion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Suddenly I became persona non grata.</v>

630
00:30:48.730 --> 00:30:50.320
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

631
00:30:50.321 --> 00:30:55.321
<v Speaker 4>That's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't think that there'll will be </v>

632
00:30:55.321 --> 00:30:57.001
<v Speaker 4>the case as far as they are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're even schools in southern </v>

633
00:30:57.001 --> 00:31:00.511
<v Speaker 4>California that won't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they do this legally because they </v>

634
00:31:00.511 --> 00:31:02.920
<v Speaker 4>are religiously founded institution.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're not the seventh,</v>

635
00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:06.900
<v Speaker 4>seventh day adventists,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can grant you tenure it.</v>

636
00:31:06.970 --> 00:31:11.970
<v Speaker 4>There's another school that had a god </v>
<v Speaker 4>squad whereby you go up in front of the </v>

637
00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:11.970
<v Speaker 4>Gospel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

638
00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:13.560
<v Speaker 4>that's literally their term where,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

639
00:31:13.670 --> 00:31:18.220
<v Speaker 4>you have to sort of show that you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>accepting Jesus in your heart.</v>

640
00:31:18.221 --> 00:31:20.740
<v Speaker 4>And I remember when I school,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a school college,</v>

641
00:31:20.741 --> 00:31:22.090
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very prominent school.</v>

642
00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:23.130
<v Speaker 4>Please.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then it though.</v>

643
00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:28.720
<v Speaker 4>Can you write it rhymes with Layola </v>
<v Speaker 4>Marymount?</v>

644
00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:29.560
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not,</v>

645
00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:31.920
<v Speaker 4>but it's within that general area.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

646
00:31:32.030 --> 00:31:35.200
<v Speaker 4>there's another school three years ago </v>
<v Speaker 4>who was going to make me a huge,</v>

647
00:31:35.290 --> 00:31:40.290
<v Speaker 4>huge offer in Orange County that didn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>work out now to the person who wanted me</v>

648
00:31:40.931 --> 00:31:43.450
<v Speaker 4>to appear in front of the God squad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This was several years ago when I was at</v>

649
00:31:43.451 --> 00:31:44.950
<v Speaker 4>UC Irvine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I told him,</v>

650
00:31:45.010 --> 00:31:48.790
<v Speaker 4>you do realize that I am a atheist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lebanese Jew.</v>

651
00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:53.350
<v Speaker 4>Evolution is so it's going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be a while before I accept</v>

652
00:31:53.351 --> 00:31:58.351
<v Speaker 4>Jesus in my heart and it his answer was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

653
00:31:58.961 --> 00:31:59.710
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but don't worry.</v>

654
00:31:59.711 --> 00:32:01.180
<v Speaker 4>We'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll coach you as to,</v>

655
00:32:01.270 --> 00:32:03.040
<v Speaker 4>as to what to say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

656
00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:06.790
<v Speaker 4>so that's a euphemism for lying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

657
00:32:06.850 --> 00:32:09.320
<v Speaker 4>How's that fit with the whole real?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>

658
00:32:09.321 --> 00:32:13.840
<v Speaker 4>this is right here in 21st century,</v>
<v Speaker 4>southern California in academia,</v>

659
00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:18.920
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you better hold certain religious </v>

660
00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:18.920
<v Speaker 4>beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>otherwise we'll punish you.</v>

661
00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:18.920
<v Speaker 4>Jew.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Boy,</v>

662
00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:23.250
<v Speaker 4>that's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's some colleges and then or </v>

663
00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:24.850
<v Speaker 4>some universities and the universities </v>
<v Speaker 4>to complete opposite.</v>

664
00:32:24.851 --> 00:32:29.851
<v Speaker 4>If you're not an atheist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure that you'd take a lot of slash </v>

665
00:32:29.851 --> 00:32:33.250
<v Speaker 4>true at other universities or in </v>
<v Speaker 4>academia in general,</v>

666
00:32:33.330 --> 00:32:38.330
<v Speaker 4>it is quite a progressive to criticize </v>
<v Speaker 4>certainly Christianity,</v>

667
00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:41.900
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because you're seen as a progressive guy</v>

668
00:32:41.901 --> 00:32:43.670
<v Speaker 4>who doesn't buy into all this brunch </v>
<v Speaker 4>aid,</v>

669
00:32:43.671 --> 00:32:46.260
<v Speaker 4>superstitions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there is one religion that</v>

670
00:32:46.410 --> 00:32:49.120
<v Speaker 1>Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she Islamophobia.</v>

671
00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:53.270
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that fascinating?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>

672
00:32:53.271 --> 00:32:58.271
<v Speaker 1>This is same ultra progressives that </v>
<v Speaker 1>would give you a million different ways </v>

673
00:32:58.271 --> 00:33:03.221
<v Speaker 1>to address someone based on whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>gender they identify with or you know,</v>

674
00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:06.590
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Weird ultra super sensitive thing.</v>

675
00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:09.830
<v Speaker 1>I find that completely fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This Islamophobia thing you find,</v>

676
00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:14.120
<v Speaker 1>there's several websites that I frequent</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to freak myself out,</v>

677
00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:15.400
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

678
00:33:15.450 --> 00:33:18.080
<v Speaker 1>the super sensitive ones on a regular </v>
<v Speaker 1>basis,</v>

679
00:33:18.081 --> 00:33:20.550
<v Speaker 1>we'll go over this Islamophobia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

680
00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:20.810
<v Speaker 1>because</v>

681
00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:21.540
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

682
00:33:21.541 --> 00:33:21.820
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

683
00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:26.730
<v Speaker 4>it's actually a very astute way to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to have intellectual warfare.</v>

684
00:33:26.731 --> 00:33:31.731
<v Speaker 4>You're actually saying that people who </v>
<v Speaker 4>are concerned about particular aspects </v>

685
00:33:31.731 --> 00:33:34.050
<v Speaker 4>of this ideology are crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

686
00:33:34.051 --> 00:33:39.051
<v Speaker 4>They suffer from a phobia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you are denigrating them at their </v>

687
00:33:39.051 --> 00:33:41.370
<v Speaker 4>core.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You must be nuts to actually fear this.</v>

688
00:33:42.010 --> 00:33:45.180
<v Speaker 4>And actually the term started as you may</v>
<v Speaker 4>or may not know,</v>

689
00:33:45.181 --> 00:33:50.181
<v Speaker 4>it started with the Muslim Brotherhood,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a very smart strategy where they knew </v>

690
00:33:50.251 --> 00:33:53.550
<v Speaker 4>that the west is very open to being </v>
<v Speaker 4>tolerant and so on.</v>

691
00:33:53.730 --> 00:33:58.730
<v Speaker 4>And so they kind of piggybacked on that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so in academia you just never </v>

692
00:33:58.730 --> 00:34:00.630
<v Speaker 4>criticized that one I got.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now that's very dangerous because in a,</v>

693
00:34:00.631 --> 00:34:04.710
<v Speaker 4>in a sane world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all beliefs should be open to criticism.</v>

694
00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:06.460
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And not only that,</v>

695
00:34:06.461 --> 00:34:10.630
<v Speaker 1>how about the one that is responsible </v>
<v Speaker 1>for most of the suicide bombing?</v>

696
00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:13.660
<v Speaker 1>Some of phobic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am Islamophobia.</v>

697
00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:15.610
<v Speaker 1>Set it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Islamophobia,</v>

698
00:34:15.650 --> 00:34:17.080
<v Speaker 1>Juha phobic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Catholic,</v>

699
00:34:17.081 --> 00:34:21.340
<v Speaker 1>a phobic Christian of phobic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm afraid of all of your reason.</v>

700
00:34:21.350 --> 00:34:24.130
<v Speaker 1>Fillic you love the reason that I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

701
00:34:24.131 --> 00:34:26.350
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was raised a Catholic for a very short</v>

702
00:34:26.351 --> 00:34:28.720
<v Speaker 1>amount of time and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got very lucky.</v>

703
00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:33.640
<v Speaker 1>I had a very tumultuous childhood and </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was in first grade my parents put</v>

704
00:34:33.641 --> 00:34:38.641
<v Speaker 1>me in Catholic school and up until then </v>
<v Speaker 1>I was obviously don't remember much of </v>

705
00:34:38.921 --> 00:34:43.921
<v Speaker 1>this because it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was very religious and it was </v>

706
00:34:43.921 --> 00:34:46.831
<v Speaker 1>because my parents were divorcing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a lot of violence in the </v>

707
00:34:46.831 --> 00:34:50.821
<v Speaker 1>household and I have this idea in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>head that somehow or another God was the</v>

708
00:34:51.341 --> 00:34:52.930
<v Speaker 1>right way and everybody else was wrong.</v>

709
00:34:53.410 --> 00:34:56.230
<v Speaker 1>Going to Catholic school cured me of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that entirely.</v>

710
00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:59.020
<v Speaker 1>The nun that I had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sister Mary Josephine,</v>

711
00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:02.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember much about being six </v>
<v Speaker 1>years old,</v>

712
00:35:02.561 --> 00:35:04.980
<v Speaker 1>but I remember that bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

713
00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:06.880
<v Speaker 1>she was very important to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

714
00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:11.940
<v Speaker 1>she really straightened me out because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>realized that she has no connection </v>

715
00:35:11.981 --> 00:35:16.981
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever to anything holy or majestic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She represented and she,</v>

716
00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:22.480
<v Speaker 1>she showed all of the horrors of </v>
<v Speaker 1>humanity.</v>

717
00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:24.430
<v Speaker 1>Meanness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>evilness,</v>

718
00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:29.280
<v Speaker 1>being nasty to children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fearmongering and this,</v>

719
00:35:29.281 --> 00:35:32.170
<v Speaker 1>this is ailia killed everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the above.</v>

720
00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:33.730
<v Speaker 1>It was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was nothing,</v>

721
00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:38.880
<v Speaker 1>nothing holy about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was pretty obvious pretty quickly </v>

722
00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:40.740
<v Speaker 1>that it was all bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was cured from one year of Catholic</v>

723
00:35:40.741 --> 00:35:45.741
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told my parents was gonna run away </v>

724
00:35:45.741 --> 00:35:45.741
<v Speaker 1>from home if they tried to put me in </v>
<v Speaker 1>second grade.</v>

725
00:35:45.741 --> 00:35:45.741
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

726
00:35:45.741 --> 00:35:45.990
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm done.</v>

727
00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:47.630
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't understand what it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

728
00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:49.020
<v Speaker 1>I went from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

729
00:35:49.021 --> 00:35:51.210
<v Speaker 1>being around my mother was this great </v>
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

730
00:35:51.211 --> 00:35:54.210
<v Speaker 1>sweet my grandparents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or great to all of a sudden,</v>

731
00:35:54.211 --> 00:35:55.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't go to kindergarten.</v>

732
00:35:55.381 --> 00:36:00.381
<v Speaker 1>I just went to first grade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was my first year in school to being </v>

733
00:36:00.381 --> 00:36:03.141
<v Speaker 1>round these monsters and this monster </v>
<v Speaker 1>school that was just filled with </v>

734
00:36:03.141 --> 00:36:07.340
<v Speaker 1>darkness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like the whole school was just </v>

735
00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:07.340
<v Speaker 1>dark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the priests,</v>

736
00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:08.340
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember their faces,</v>

737
00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:11.700
<v Speaker 1>they all had these gin blossoms all over</v>
<v Speaker 1>their faces from drinking,</v>

738
00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:17.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the nuns were all overweight and </v>

739
00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:20.150
<v Speaker 1>bitter and angry and they're fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>skin was having a bad relationship with </v>

740
00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:21.810
<v Speaker 1>their face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like hanging off of them.</v>

741
00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:23.610
<v Speaker 1>Everything about them was just </v>
<v Speaker 1>monstrous.</v>

742
00:36:23.611 --> 00:36:28.611
<v Speaker 1>That evilness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm keeping accounts that have the </v>

743
00:36:28.611 --> 00:36:28.920
<v Speaker 1>amount of hate mail that's to </v>
<v Speaker 1>comfortable with come bitches.</v>

744
00:36:28.921 --> 00:36:31.230
<v Speaker 1>Let it come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just send it right back to you.</v>

745
00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:33.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't get it.</v>

746
00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:36.000
<v Speaker 1>You know I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fascinated by it,</v>

747
00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:41.030
<v Speaker 1>but I understand that people need that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have this desire to believe in </v>

748
00:36:41.431 --> 00:36:43.230
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand that,</v>

749
00:36:43.231 --> 00:36:46.110
<v Speaker 1>but I don't understand how you can be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>rational,</v>

750
00:36:46.111 --> 00:36:51.111
<v Speaker 1>intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>objective person who looks at some shit </v>

751
00:36:51.111 --> 00:36:51.210
<v Speaker 1>that people wrote thousands of years ago</v>
<v Speaker 1>and say,</v>

752
00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:52.140
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is.</v>

753
00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:55.720
<v Speaker 1>This is immobile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is exactly it's.</v>

754
00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:59.180
<v Speaker 1>You cannot alter it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what it is and this is.</v>

755
00:36:59.181 --> 00:37:01.500
<v Speaker 1>This is written in stone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is.</v>

756
00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:03.660
<v Speaker 1>There's no way around this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is God's word.</v>

757
00:37:03.930 --> 00:37:05.400
<v Speaker 1>Anybody questions that as a full.</v>

758
00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:08.760
<v Speaker 4>I do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and in my one of my latest books,</v>

759
00:37:08.761 --> 00:37:13.761
<v Speaker 4>I have a chapter which I think got me in</v>
<v Speaker 4>trouble with one of the southern </v>

760
00:37:13.761 --> 00:37:15.300
<v Speaker 4>California schools that I was getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>enough from it because I've given them a</v>

761
00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:18.720
<v Speaker 4>signed copy of that book and then they </v>
<v Speaker 4>probably got to that chapter.</v>

762
00:37:18.721 --> 00:37:21.750
<v Speaker 4>It's called that chapter's called </v>
<v Speaker 4>marketing hope by selling lies.</v>

763
00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:27.200
<v Speaker 4>And so what I do in that chapter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as I go through different hope Adler's </v>

764
00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:30.330
<v Speaker 4>of which religion is the greatest,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but others will be medical quackery,</v>

765
00:37:30.331 --> 00:37:31.800
<v Speaker 4>self help,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gurus and so on.</v>

766
00:37:32.130 --> 00:37:35.910
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so different agents that peddle hope,</v>

767
00:37:36.150 --> 00:37:38.840
<v Speaker 4>and I argue again from an evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 4>perspective because they,</v>

768
00:37:38.980 --> 00:37:42.320
<v Speaker 4>they're very successful because they </v>
<v Speaker 4>cater to these very basil,</v>

769
00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:47.400
<v Speaker 4>Darwinian insecurities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>None greater than the very obvious one </v>

770
00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:48.080
<v Speaker 4>of existential angst,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

771
00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:51.600
<v Speaker 4>We're the only animal that we're aware </v>
<v Speaker 4>of that actually is aware that we are on</v>

772
00:37:51.601 --> 00:37:52.560
<v Speaker 4>a death sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

773
00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:54.050
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know that I've got another thing,</v>

774
00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:56.190
<v Speaker 4>luckily maybe 40 years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

775
00:37:56.490 --> 00:37:57.960
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I have high cholesterol,</v>

776
00:37:57.961 --> 00:38:00.050
<v Speaker 4>I go to my physician,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he gives me lipitor,</v>

777
00:38:00.090 --> 00:38:01.440
<v Speaker 4>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ldl goes down,</v>

778
00:38:01.441 --> 00:38:02.990
<v Speaker 4>everybody's happy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but how?</v>

779
00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:07.410
<v Speaker 4>What pill do I take to solve this really</v>
<v Speaker 4>looming problem that's at the end of the</v>

780
00:38:07.411 --> 00:38:09.120
<v Speaker 4>road called my death?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

781
00:38:09.150 --> 00:38:11.940
<v Speaker 4>different religions will give you </v>
<v Speaker 4>different dances,</v>

782
00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:15.270
<v Speaker 4>but they all certainly promise you some </v>
<v Speaker 4>form of eternity.</v>

783
00:38:15.271 --> 00:38:16.890
<v Speaker 4>It could be in the form of </v>
<v Speaker 4>reincarnation,</v>

784
00:38:16.891 --> 00:38:18.120
<v Speaker 4>it could be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll be with Jesus.</v>

785
00:38:18.121 --> 00:38:22.230
<v Speaker 4>It could be a divergence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there are all sorts of ways by which</v>

786
00:38:22.231 --> 00:38:27.231
<v Speaker 4>I could secure my attorney and I think </v>
<v Speaker 4>for most people it's very difficult to </v>

787
00:38:29.010 --> 00:38:34.010
<v Speaker 4>not drink that kool aid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it takes almost a pathological </v>

788
00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:36.040
<v Speaker 4>and dysfunctional to</v>

789
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:37.480
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to buy that.</v>

790
00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:42.540
<v Speaker 1>I realize that I've got 80 years and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to really do the best that I can </v>

791
00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:46.291
<v Speaker 1>drink those 80 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a lot more comforting to </v>

792
00:38:46.291 --> 00:38:46.291
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

793
00:38:46.291 --> 00:38:47.770
<v Speaker 1>this part is going to go on forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It certainly more comforting.</v>

794
00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:52.150
<v Speaker 1>It's also there's something about human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings where we realized somewhere along</v>

795
00:38:52.151 --> 00:38:57.151
<v Speaker 1>the line that it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no one alive that has any more </v>

796
00:38:57.151 --> 00:39:01.981
<v Speaker 1>answers about what lies beyond the great</v>
<v Speaker 1>beyond after death.</v>

797
00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:06.820
<v Speaker 1>What lies beyond the yawning grave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one has any answers.</v>

798
00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:08.710
<v Speaker 1>You can't give you what the answer is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>

799
00:39:08.770 --> 00:39:12.340
<v Speaker 1>Nothing you would hope so are you would </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that you have that answer,</v>

800
00:39:12.341 --> 00:39:13.930
<v Speaker 1>but have you ever done psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 1>drugs?</v>

801
00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:19.180
<v Speaker 1>Haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There you go so you don't answer so </v>

802
00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:20.670
<v Speaker 1>quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I tell you there are two ways of of</v>

803
00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:25.510
<v Speaker 1>seeking to reach and mortality at one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>course is it might seem a bit crass,</v>

804
00:39:25.511 --> 00:39:27.640
<v Speaker 1>but through just the genetic </v>
<v Speaker 1>propagation,</v>

805
00:39:27.641 --> 00:39:32.641
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your children are in a sense your form </v>

806
00:39:32.641 --> 00:39:32.641
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>

807
00:39:32.641 --> 00:39:32.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't buy that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't like that one?</v>

808
00:39:32.770 --> 00:39:35.410
<v Speaker 1>It's not immortal because the earth </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't last.</v>

809
00:39:35.650 --> 00:39:40.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless someone figures out how to get </v>

810
00:39:40.650 --> 00:39:42.541
<v Speaker 1>off the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we only have what one point 9 billion </v>

811
00:39:42.541 --> 00:39:42.541
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

812
00:39:42.541 --> 00:39:46.670
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we don't have enough time for </v>

813
00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:46.670
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no way.</v>

814
00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:50.460
<v Speaker 1>There's no in mortality unless there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a fractal nature to the </v>

815
00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:54.391
<v Speaker 1>universe where it's life and death is </v>
<v Speaker 1>just completely ongoing cycle where the </v>

816
00:39:54.391 --> 00:39:57.520
<v Speaker 1>deeper you go it starts again and yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about that.</v>

817
00:39:57.550 --> 00:40:00.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about that either,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is possible.</v>

818
00:40:01.090 --> 00:40:06.090
<v Speaker 1>The universe itself is so bizarre and </v>
<v Speaker 1>unexpected and the more you look into </v>

819
00:40:06.090 --> 00:40:07.540
<v Speaker 1>the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I remember when I was a kid,</v>

820
00:40:07.541 --> 00:40:12.541
<v Speaker 1>I used to think space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to think of space like a </v>

821
00:40:12.541 --> 00:40:12.640
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really did.</v>

822
00:40:12.830 --> 00:40:16.630
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember very succinctly that,</v>

823
00:40:16.631 --> 00:40:21.631
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would like look at like buck rogers </v>

824
00:40:21.631 --> 00:40:21.631
<v Speaker 1>and all these different space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

825
00:40:21.631 --> 00:40:25.130
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to go over to this town </v>

826
00:40:25.130 --> 00:40:25.130
<v Speaker 1>and they're going to come back and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>is our neighborhood.</v>

827
00:40:25.130 --> 00:40:25.930
<v Speaker 1>They're going to go to that neighborhood</v>
<v Speaker 1>and come back.</v>

828
00:40:26.350 --> 00:40:31.350
<v Speaker 1>And then as I got older and I started </v>
<v Speaker 1>studying astronomy and I started </v>

829
00:40:31.350 --> 00:40:35.760
<v Speaker 1>studying the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as I got older also the knowledge </v>

830
00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:39.810
<v Speaker 1>that they had about the amount of stars </v>
<v Speaker 1>changed and they started talking about </v>

831
00:40:39.810 --> 00:40:43.960
<v Speaker 1>how there's more stars in our galaxy </v>
<v Speaker 1>than there are grains of sand on all the</v>

832
00:40:43.961 --> 00:40:45.320
<v Speaker 1>beaches and all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

833
00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:48.670
<v Speaker 1>all the beaches on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I remember just thinking like,</v>

834
00:40:48.671 --> 00:40:53.671
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a motherfucker of a </v>

835
00:40:53.671 --> 00:40:54.931
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this is starting to get really </v>

836
00:40:54.931 --> 00:40:54.931
<v Speaker 1>strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>

837
00:40:54.931 --> 00:40:57.040
<v Speaker 1>And then as you get older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>still you realize that they,</v>

838
00:40:57.100 --> 00:40:59.920
<v Speaker 1>there's no way they know how big it all </v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

839
00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:03.880
<v Speaker 1>They have a general sense of 14 plus </v>
<v Speaker 1>billion light years.</v>

840
00:41:04.030 --> 00:41:07.090
<v Speaker 1>But then there's the fractal nature of </v>
<v Speaker 1>black holes.</v>

841
00:41:07.091 --> 00:41:12.091
<v Speaker 1>The possibility that inside every galaxy</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a black hole that contains an </v>

842
00:41:12.091 --> 00:41:16.141
<v Speaker 1>entirely new universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is something that's being </v>

843
00:41:16.141 --> 00:41:16.141
<v Speaker 1>thrown about by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not by freaks,</v>

844
00:41:16.141 --> 00:41:18.580
<v Speaker 1>but by like real serious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>legitimate scientists.</v>

845
00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:24.000
<v Speaker 1>So that alone is so bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that you live and die seems </v>

846
00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:28.350
<v Speaker 1>very trivial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They come back again or reincarnation </v>

847
00:41:28.350 --> 00:41:28.530
<v Speaker 1>mean why not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If a,</v>

848
00:41:28.570 --> 00:41:30.590
<v Speaker 1>if a supernova can exist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

849
00:41:30.610 --> 00:41:33.890
<v Speaker 1>why is it so crazy that a person lives </v>
<v Speaker 1>for and just</v>

850
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:36.080
<v Speaker 3>continues to reincarnate?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

851
00:41:36.110 --> 00:41:38.150
<v Speaker 3>and in light of all that vast vastness </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you said,</v>

852
00:41:38.151 --> 00:41:40.640
<v Speaker 3>isn't it incredible that all of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>monotheistic,</v>

853
00:41:40.641 --> 00:41:45.641
<v Speaker 3>Abrahamic religions would argue that on </v>
<v Speaker 3>some small speck of sand in some bronze </v>

854
00:41:46.401 --> 00:41:49.760
<v Speaker 3>age point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God spoke to some profit and told them,</v>

855
00:41:49.761 --> 00:41:54.761
<v Speaker 3>you really better not eat pig know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in this great unit universe,</v>

856
00:41:56.010 --> 00:42:01.010
<v Speaker 3>ca know this cosmos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really important that you don't </v>

857
00:42:01.010 --> 00:42:04.301
<v Speaker 3>wear leather,</v>
<v Speaker 3>leather shoes that young people or </v>

858
00:42:04.301 --> 00:42:06.671
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just astonishing to me that people </v>

859
00:42:06.671 --> 00:42:07.160
<v Speaker 3>actually buy this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

860
00:42:07.161 --> 00:42:09.410
<v Speaker 3>I think that the reason for the pig </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>

861
00:42:09.411 --> 00:42:10.140
<v Speaker 3>and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

862
00:42:10.190 --> 00:42:11.000
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

863
00:42:11.001 --> 00:42:13.700
<v Speaker 3>I've talked about this recently with my </v>
<v Speaker 3>friend already who,</v>

864
00:42:13.701 --> 00:42:18.701
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was raised very religious Judaism and </v>

865
00:42:18.701 --> 00:42:20.500
<v Speaker 3>then as he got older just decided to </v>
<v Speaker 3>abandon it all.</v>

866
00:42:20.530 --> 00:42:22.580
<v Speaker 3>Now he's at dirty comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hilarious,</v>

867
00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:27.940
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were talking about that the pork </v>

868
00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:27.940
<v Speaker 3>thing was probably due to diseases.</v>

869
00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:30.870
<v Speaker 3>I talk about that in my analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I,</v>

870
00:42:30.871 --> 00:42:33.770
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't do the analysis for a pork,</v>

871
00:42:33.771 --> 00:42:38.570
<v Speaker 3>I do it for shellfish and so if you look</v>
<v Speaker 3>at shelf red tide and things along those</v>

872
00:42:38.571 --> 00:42:41.960
<v Speaker 3>lines so you can't tell which one is </v>
<v Speaker 3>infected,</v>

873
00:42:42.410 --> 00:42:44.810
<v Speaker 3>you can't look at the water and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

874
00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:49.430
<v Speaker 3>and predict which one would likely have </v>
<v Speaker 3>the bacteria.</v>

875
00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:54.820
<v Speaker 3>And so all you know is that once in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>while somebody would eat it and drop </v>

876
00:42:54.820 --> 00:42:58.971
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Since you don't have any ability during </v>

877
00:42:58.971 --> 00:43:02.261
<v Speaker 3>the bronze age to refrigerate and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well you don't have any access to the </v>

878
00:43:02.261 --> 00:43:07.091
<v Speaker 3>germ theory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Certainly they didn't know anything </v>

879
00:43:07.091 --> 00:43:08.951
<v Speaker 3>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well then it must be some mild </v>

880
00:43:08.951 --> 00:43:10.841
<v Speaker 3>addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you're exactly right that there </v>

881
00:43:10.841 --> 00:43:10.841
<v Speaker 3>are very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very clear,</v>

882
00:43:10.841 --> 00:43:12.830
<v Speaker 3>obvious biological explanations for most</v>
<v Speaker 3>of these food taboos.</v>

883
00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:18.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just ridiculous that in 2014 Peter </v>

884
00:43:18.190 --> 00:43:18.190
<v Speaker 3>People don't realize the origins of </v>
<v Speaker 3>these.</v>

885
00:43:18.190 --> 00:43:23.140
<v Speaker 3>Like yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a great idea 2000 years ago </v>

886
00:43:23.140 --> 00:43:25.751
<v Speaker 3>before we understood thermometers that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you you have to cook your meat to 150 </v>

887
00:43:25.751 --> 00:43:28.070
<v Speaker 3>degrees that kills the bacteria and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's perfectly,</v>

888
00:43:28.071 --> 00:43:32.150
<v Speaker 3>totally healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you try to eat pork the same way,</v>

889
00:43:32.151 --> 00:43:37.151
<v Speaker 3>you will try to eat venison,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get really sick and </v>

890
00:43:37.151 --> 00:43:37.160
<v Speaker 3>that's why religions like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey look,</v>

891
00:43:37.161 --> 00:43:39.740
<v Speaker 3>if we want to keep our people alive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've got to tell them not to eat.</v>

892
00:43:39.741 --> 00:43:42.980
<v Speaker 3>This particular animal is an animal that</v>
<v Speaker 3>eats a lot of stupid shit.</v>

893
00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:45.250
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

894
00:43:45.650 --> 00:43:50.650
<v Speaker 3>so religion has been the biggest blow </v>
<v Speaker 3>back of your work or actually probably </v>

895
00:43:53.241 --> 00:43:58.241
<v Speaker 3>the ones that are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that were the most acerbic and their </v>

896
00:43:58.241 --> 00:44:00.740
<v Speaker 3>criticisms have been other social </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientists even more.</v>

897
00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:05.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the social sciences have very </v>

898
00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:09.281
<v Speaker 3>much developed over the past hundred </v>
<v Speaker 3>years with a complete rejection of </v>

899
00:44:09.281 --> 00:44:10.340
<v Speaker 3>biology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How is that a science then?</v>

900
00:44:10.470 --> 00:44:14.020
<v Speaker 3>They called social sciences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You rejected biology,</v>

901
00:44:14.021 --> 00:44:16.880
<v Speaker 3>which is measurable and Social Sciences </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of.</v>

902
00:44:16.910 --> 00:44:21.910
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they argue is that what makes us </v>

903
00:44:21.910 --> 00:44:24.641
<v Speaker 3>human is that we transcend our biology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so don't use the evolutionary mechanisms</v>

904
00:44:24.951 --> 00:44:29.951
<v Speaker 3>that explain the behavior of the Zebra </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the dog and the mosquito to explain </v>

905
00:44:29.951 --> 00:44:31.980
<v Speaker 3>our behaviors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What makes us it human is</v>

906
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:35.130
<v Speaker 4>precisely that we're able to transcend </v>
<v Speaker 4>these biological imperatives.</v>

907
00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:36.510
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

908
00:44:36.511 --> 00:44:38.930
<v Speaker 4>the field of anthropology,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not anthropology,</v>

909
00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:41.640
<v Speaker 4>which is a subset of anthropology that </v>
<v Speaker 4>recognizes biology,</v>

910
00:44:41.780 --> 00:44:44.430
<v Speaker 4>but for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cultural anthropology is all about going</v>

911
00:44:44.431 --> 00:44:48.900
<v Speaker 4>to all of these exotic cultures and </v>
<v Speaker 4>demonstrating how each culture is unique</v>

912
00:44:48.901 --> 00:44:53.901
<v Speaker 4>and different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And hence there are no such thing as </v>

913
00:44:53.901 --> 00:44:55.941
<v Speaker 4>human universals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A social psychology is pretty much </v>

914
00:44:55.941 --> 00:44:56.310
<v Speaker 4>operated without any understanding of </v>
<v Speaker 4>biology.</v>

915
00:44:56.640 --> 00:45:01.640
<v Speaker 4>So what I did in my work as I came along</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I founded this field which I coined </v>

916
00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:06.411
<v Speaker 4>evolutionary consumption,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where I apply evolutionary theory in </v>

917
00:45:06.411 --> 00:45:07.290
<v Speaker 4>biology to study consumer behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but more generally my,</v>

918
00:45:07.310 --> 00:45:11.390
<v Speaker 4>my real goal is to what I call maybe </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a grand goal to Darwin eyes,</v>

919
00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:14.460
<v Speaker 4>the business school.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The idea is that you can study anything.</v>

920
00:45:14.461 --> 00:45:19.461
<v Speaker 4>You can't study invest investment </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychology or personnel psychology or </v>

921
00:45:19.461 --> 00:45:22.890
<v Speaker 4>organizational behavior or consumer </v>
<v Speaker 4>behavior without recognizing that all of</v>

922
00:45:22.891 --> 00:45:25.380
<v Speaker 4>these players are biological beings,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

923
00:45:25.650 --> 00:45:30.650
<v Speaker 4>The decision that you make if your blood</v>
<v Speaker 4>sugar is low and you're hungry is very </v>

924
00:45:30.650 --> 00:45:31.890
<v Speaker 4>different than decision you make if </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're satiated,</v>

925
00:45:31.891 --> 00:45:32.220
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

926
00:45:32.221 --> 00:45:34.260
<v Speaker 4>that's a trivial example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but a very obvious one.</v>

927
00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:39.710
<v Speaker 4>So the idea that economists have spent </v>
<v Speaker 4>100 years developing all these fanciful </v>

928
00:45:39.710 --> 00:45:44.540
<v Speaker 4>mathematical models without ever </v>
<v Speaker 4>recognizing that there are these </v>

929
00:45:44.540 --> 00:45:48.711
<v Speaker 4>biological forces that compel us to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>the decision makers that we are is </v>

930
00:45:48.711 --> 00:45:53.420
<v Speaker 4>astounding to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the greatest blow back has been from </v>

931
00:45:53.420 --> 00:45:56.271
<v Speaker 4>social scientists who typically have </v>
<v Speaker 4>been very reticent to accept what this </v>

932
00:45:57.481 --> 00:46:00.180
<v Speaker 4>biology boys saying about consumer </v>
<v Speaker 4>behavior and so on.</v>

933
00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:02.580
<v Speaker 4>Fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not the good news.</v>

934
00:46:02.990 --> 00:46:07.990
<v Speaker 4>Can I kind of go on please?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always use a quote by a guy called the</v>

935
00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:14.480
<v Speaker 4>JBS Haldane,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who was a very evolutionary geneticist </v>

936
00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:14.520
<v Speaker 4>who was very quotable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very had all these great clips.</v>

937
00:46:14.910 --> 00:46:19.910
<v Speaker 4>So he said that there are four stages </v>
<v Speaker 4>that scientists go through before they </v>

938
00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:22.020
<v Speaker 4>accept the theory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'll start paraphrasing.</v>

939
00:46:22.021 --> 00:46:24.030
<v Speaker 4>So Stage one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is bullshit.</v>

940
00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:27.510
<v Speaker 4>This is garbage stage two,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well this might be true,</v>

941
00:46:27.511 --> 00:46:30.400
<v Speaker 4>but it's rather perverse stage three.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

942
00:46:30.410 --> 00:46:31.680
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is true,</v>

943
00:46:31.770 --> 00:46:35.460
<v Speaker 4>but largely unimportant and stage four </v>
<v Speaker 4>or I always set so</v>

944
00:46:37.170 --> 00:46:39.110
<v Speaker 3>the reason why that quote</v>

945
00:46:39.210 --> 00:46:41.700
<v Speaker 4>captures,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean if I ever did an autobiography of</v>

946
00:46:41.701 --> 00:46:42.760
<v Speaker 4>my scientific career,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I.</v>

947
00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:48.080
<v Speaker 4>That quote is basically my book because </v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen people go through these four </v>

948
00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:51.810
<v Speaker 4>stages in their responses to my work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At first I couldn't get an invitation to</v>

949
00:46:51.811 --> 00:46:55.750
<v Speaker 4>go to to get 20 minutes at a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at a conference to speak because what?</v>

950
00:46:55.751 --> 00:47:00.751
<v Speaker 4>What does biology you have to do with </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything and now of course sciences and </v>

951
00:47:00.751 --> 00:47:04.640
<v Speaker 4>author corrective process.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The evidence is coming in my way and I </v>

952
00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:04.640
<v Speaker 4>don't mean to gloat about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

953
00:47:05.930 --> 00:47:10.930
<v Speaker 3>Now they're all coming fast and furious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're the man and I remember 10 years </v>

954
00:47:11.681 --> 00:47:14.410
<v Speaker 3>ago I've still kept your email where you</v>
<v Speaker 3>said I was a bullshitter.</v>

955
00:47:15.020 --> 00:47:15.940
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that wasn't me.</v>

956
00:47:15.941 --> 00:47:18.810
<v Speaker 3>That must have been my research </v>
<v Speaker 3>assistant who hacked my email.</v>

957
00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:25.420
<v Speaker 3>How Dane is a great guy to quote.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had a fantastic quote that I love.</v>

958
00:47:25.450 --> 00:47:30.450
<v Speaker 3>Not only is the universe queer than we </v>
<v Speaker 3>suppose it's queer than we can it that </v>

959
00:47:30.450 --> 00:47:30.450
<v Speaker 3>you</v>

960
00:47:30.450 --> 00:47:31.000
<v Speaker 4>know what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're my.</v>

961
00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:33.670
<v Speaker 4>You're my new coolest guy to to actually</v>
<v Speaker 4>know who,</v>

962
00:47:33.671 --> 00:47:35.820
<v Speaker 4>how Dane is your event.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

963
00:47:35.870 --> 00:47:38.210
<v Speaker 4>it's a special quote.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's just an amazing.</v>

964
00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:40.370
<v Speaker 4>I'm the Beatles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know the exact.</v>

965
00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:41.290
<v Speaker 4>Do you know this one?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

966
00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:44.200
<v Speaker 4>I think there are something like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hope I'm not getting it wrong,</v>

967
00:47:44.201 --> 00:47:49.201
<v Speaker 4>but maybe 300,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>species of beetles and so in his quote,</v>

968
00:47:49.421 --> 00:47:50.250
<v Speaker 4>he basically says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

969
00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:55.380
<v Speaker 4>if God exists,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he must have a particular penchant for </v>

970
00:47:55.380 --> 00:47:59.431
<v Speaker 4>beetles for having spent so much effort </v>
<v Speaker 4>and coming up with all of these </v>

971
00:47:59.431 --> 00:48:00.940
<v Speaker 4>different species variations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

972
00:48:00.941 --> 00:48:01.690
<v Speaker 4>no kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

973
00:48:01.870 --> 00:48:06.870
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is it frustrating being a man who </v>

974
00:48:06.870 --> 00:48:10.591
<v Speaker 4>is an intellectual who is trying to go </v>
<v Speaker 4>over the variables and try to figure it </v>

975
00:48:13.571 --> 00:48:18.571
<v Speaker 4>all out and piece it together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it frustrating to you to see these </v>

976
00:48:18.571 --> 00:48:22.860
<v Speaker 4>obvious biases and this is obvious,</v>
<v Speaker 4>muddy thinking that enters into this,</v>

977
00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:25.210
<v Speaker 4>this sort of debate.</v>

978
00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:29.800
<v Speaker 4>It is on two levels,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on sort of the intrinsic level.</v>

979
00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:32.110
<v Speaker 4>I'm a dog,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a pursuer of the truth,</v>

980
00:48:32.111 --> 00:48:37.111
<v Speaker 4>and so I almost get offended by these </v>
<v Speaker 4>positions and so in that sense it's </v>

981
00:48:37.111 --> 00:48:37.590
<v Speaker 4>frustrating,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's also an extra,</v>

982
00:48:37.660 --> 00:48:40.870
<v Speaker 4>like a real sort of tangible way that </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's frustrating.</v>

983
00:48:41.110 --> 00:48:46.110
<v Speaker 4>A lot of these gatekeepers are the ones </v>
<v Speaker 4>who decide whether I get a position in </v>

984
00:48:46.110 --> 00:48:49.360
<v Speaker 4>southern California not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so if I play within the paradigm,</v>

985
00:48:49.361 --> 00:48:51.820
<v Speaker 4>if I do the research that is expected of</v>
<v Speaker 4>me,</v>

986
00:48:52.090 --> 00:48:56.980
<v Speaker 4>that doesn't sort of bust any existing </v>
<v Speaker 4>theories that I'm good,</v>

987
00:48:57.070 --> 00:49:00.640
<v Speaker 4>but if I'm this guy from the outside </v>
<v Speaker 4>who's trying to biologies the field,</v>

988
00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:01.200
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who,</v>

989
00:49:01.350 --> 00:49:03.730
<v Speaker 4>who does this guy think he is?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So in that sense,</v>

990
00:49:03.731 --> 00:49:06.430
<v Speaker 4>I think it's also frustrating and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my wife always tells me,</v>

991
00:49:06.700 --> 00:49:07.330
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't worry.</v>

992
00:49:07.331 --> 00:49:09.060
<v Speaker 4>I mean if you can keep this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sorry,</v>

993
00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:14.080
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it makes a big difference how you can </v>

994
00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:14.080
<v Speaker 4>move it around.</v>

995
00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:14.080
<v Speaker 4>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't mean to interrupt.</v>

996
00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:15.760
<v Speaker 4>So your wife tells you something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My wife tells me,</v>

997
00:49:15.761 --> 00:49:16.660
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

998
00:49:16.661 --> 00:49:17.790
<v Speaker 4>don't worry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

999
00:49:18.330 --> 00:49:19.810
<v Speaker 4>you'll get all your vindication.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

1000
00:49:19.811 --> 00:49:24.811
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to get vindicated when I'm </v>

1001
00:49:24.811 --> 00:49:24.811
<v Speaker 4>dead.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The postmortems I want.</v>

1002
00:49:24.850 --> 00:49:26.260
<v Speaker 4>I want the rewards now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And not,</v>

1003
00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:31.320
<v Speaker 4>not in a narcissistic way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but because there are also perks to </v>

1004
00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:32.890
<v Speaker 4>people finding out that hopefully you </v>
<v Speaker 4>are correct.</v>

1005
00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:38.280
<v Speaker 4>Now the reality is that more and more </v>
<v Speaker 4>people are coming around and so if I </v>

1006
00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:40.930
<v Speaker 4>look at the level of hostility that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>faced 10 years ago versus today,</v>

1007
00:49:40.931 --> 00:49:45.931
<v Speaker 4>it's night and day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was the first major backlash that </v>

1008
00:49:45.931 --> 00:49:50.611
<v Speaker 4>you experienced?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What social scientists not being A.</v>

1009
00:49:50.750 --> 00:49:53.620
<v Speaker 4>I mean having my papers desk rejected by</v>
<v Speaker 4>editors.</v>

1010
00:49:53.621 --> 00:49:55.330
<v Speaker 4>So that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you familiar with that?</v>

1011
00:49:55.410 --> 00:50:00.410
<v Speaker 4>To explain it for people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that means basically when you send </v>

1012
00:50:00.410 --> 00:50:03.511
<v Speaker 4>your paper to a scientific journal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>usually the editor will look at your </v>

1013
00:50:03.511 --> 00:50:03.520
<v Speaker 4>paper and say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1014
00:50:03.521 --> 00:50:08.521
<v Speaker 4>well here are three reviewers that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>think would be appropriate for this </v>

1015
00:50:08.521 --> 00:50:08.521
<v Speaker 4>paper.</v>

1016
00:50:08.521 --> 00:50:13.500
<v Speaker 4>And then he sends it off and then the </v>
<v Speaker 4>process starts and it goes back and </v>

1017
00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:16.381
<v Speaker 4>forth for probably several,</v>
<v Speaker 4>several years when he desk rejects says </v>

1018
00:50:16.381 --> 00:50:20.410
<v Speaker 4>he's basically saying that this paper is</v>
<v Speaker 4>not worthy of even going out for review.</v>

1019
00:50:21.070 --> 00:50:22.080
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1020
00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:27.160
<v Speaker 4>I would send all of these papers to </v>
<v Speaker 4>these top journals and the editor would </v>

1021
00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:27.380
<v Speaker 4>write back to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sorry,</v>

1022
00:50:27.381 --> 00:50:29.210
<v Speaker 4>I'm not even sending it through the </v>
<v Speaker 4>review process,</v>

1023
00:50:29.450 --> 00:50:31.940
<v Speaker 4>what do you remember what one of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>original ones was?</v>

1024
00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:34.770
<v Speaker 4>Was the subject of A.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1025
00:50:34.790 --> 00:50:39.790
<v Speaker 4>the probably the first one was one where</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was introducing the theoretical </v>

1026
00:50:39.790 --> 00:50:44.111
<v Speaker 4>framework of how to apply evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychology and understanding marketing </v>

1027
00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:48.790
<v Speaker 4>and usually the the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the argument that I would receive it,</v>

1028
00:50:48.850 --> 00:50:53.850
<v Speaker 4>which which is breathtakingly inane and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's stupidity as well.</v>

1029
00:50:55.101 --> 00:50:58.280
<v Speaker 4>Evolutionary theory is just a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 4>just so storytelling,</v>

1030
00:50:58.630 --> 00:51:03.630
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just come up with these fanciful </v>

1031
00:51:03.630 --> 00:51:05.910
<v Speaker 4>post hoc stories since obviously you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>not conducting an experiment in a lab to</v>

1032
00:51:06.681 --> 00:51:11.681
<v Speaker 4>demonstrate the evolution and of course </v>
<v Speaker 4>that that is so laughable because if </v>

1033
00:51:11.681 --> 00:51:13.970
<v Speaker 4>that were true,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how is it that astrophysicists study the</v>

1034
00:51:13.971 --> 00:51:17.210
<v Speaker 4>origins of the universe that's 14 </v>
<v Speaker 4>billion years ago,</v>

1035
00:51:17.211 --> 00:51:17.510
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1036
00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:21.410
<v Speaker 4>They certainly don't conduct an </v>
<v Speaker 4>experiment in the lab and to build their</v>

1037
00:51:21.411 --> 00:51:23.300
<v Speaker 4>own stars all stars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

1038
00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:24.650
<v Speaker 4>so but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but again,</v>

1039
00:51:24.710 --> 00:51:29.420
<v Speaker 4>if you're very parodic magically bound </v>
<v Speaker 4>to manipulating something in the lab,</v>

1040
00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:34.720
<v Speaker 4>then somehow evolutionary theory seems </v>
<v Speaker 4>epistemologically in terms of the </v>

1041
00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:36.530
<v Speaker 4>philosophy of science.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It seems as though it's.</v>

1042
00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:38.990
<v Speaker 4>You're just waving your hand and telling</v>
<v Speaker 4>stories.</v>

1043
00:51:38.991 --> 00:51:43.991
<v Speaker 4>Post hoc stories.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now the reality is that that's exactly </v>

1044
00:51:43.991 --> 00:51:44.630
<v Speaker 4>the opposite of what we do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If anything,</v>

1045
00:51:44.660 --> 00:51:49.660
<v Speaker 4>there is no intellectual idea that has </v>
<v Speaker 4>received as much empirical support as </v>

1046
00:51:51.111 --> 00:51:53.810
<v Speaker 4>evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it is as clear as gravity.</v>

1047
00:51:54.380 --> 00:51:59.380
<v Speaker 4>Yet people somehow can't get around to </v>
<v Speaker 4>understanding how you could explain </v>

1048
00:52:00.231 --> 00:52:03.680
<v Speaker 4>something that happened hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 4>thousands if not millions of years ago.</v>

1049
00:52:03.681 --> 00:52:06.110
<v Speaker 4>And so the original rejections were </v>
<v Speaker 4>always,</v>

1050
00:52:06.260 --> 00:52:07.010
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but come on,</v>

1051
00:52:07.011 --> 00:52:09.350
<v Speaker 4>we don't take thing on faith here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We need,</v>

1052
00:52:09.351 --> 00:52:12.380
<v Speaker 4>we need concrete evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's how it all started.</v>

1053
00:52:12.830 --> 00:52:14.690
<v Speaker 4>So that was the first blow back.</v>

1054
00:52:14.690 --> 00:52:19.690
<v Speaker 4>Did you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When did you hesitate when you first </v>

1055
00:52:19.690 --> 00:52:19.690
<v Speaker 4>experienced this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you go,</v>

1056
00:52:19.690 --> 00:52:20.770
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going down a dark road and.</v>

1057
00:52:20.771 --> 00:52:21.700
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I.</v>

1058
00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:26.840
<v Speaker 4>and that's a great question because I </v>
<v Speaker 4>think I was fortunate enough to have the</v>

1059
00:52:27.351 --> 00:52:29.960
<v Speaker 4>personality for this endeavor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In other words,</v>

1060
00:52:30.140 --> 00:52:33.650
<v Speaker 4>it's not just that you had to have the </v>
<v Speaker 4>brains to do what I was doing.</v>

1061
00:52:34.100 --> 00:52:39.100
<v Speaker 4>If I would suck my thumb going into a </v>
<v Speaker 4>fetal position and start crying every </v>

1062
00:52:39.100 --> 00:52:40.520
<v Speaker 4>time somebody rejected me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>rejected my work,</v>

1063
00:52:40.550 --> 00:52:42.950
<v Speaker 4>then I wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But because I was a fighter,</v>

1064
00:52:43.010 --> 00:52:47.840
<v Speaker 4>because I was a high testosterone guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then that only compelled me to come back</v>

1065
00:52:47.841 --> 00:52:49.550
<v Speaker 4>and say I'm going to prove these guys </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrong,</v>

1066
00:52:49.850 --> 00:52:54.850
<v Speaker 4>but at the delayed the process,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I was kept out of many of the </v>

1067
00:52:54.850 --> 00:52:56.630
<v Speaker 4>leading consumer behavior and marketing </v>
<v Speaker 4>journals for.</v>

1068
00:52:56.720 --> 00:53:01.720
<v Speaker 4>So I kind of went around them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I published books that became best </v>

1069
00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:05.181
<v Speaker 4>sellers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I published in medicine and Economics </v>

1070
00:53:05.181 --> 00:53:07.841
<v Speaker 4>and psychology and only recently have I </v>
<v Speaker 4>tried to come back to the to the folks </v>

1071
00:53:07.841 --> 00:53:11.000
<v Speaker 4>that I'm most trying to convince and </v>
<v Speaker 4>those are the consumer psychologist now.</v>

1072
00:53:11.001 --> 00:53:16.001
<v Speaker 4>Luckily I'm their friend,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but for years I was really sort of at </v>

1073
00:53:16.001 --> 00:53:17.700
<v Speaker 4>the periphery.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's fascinating as well that the.</v>

1074
00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:22.720
<v Speaker 4>The attitudes about the subjects have </v>
<v Speaker 4>evolved and changed within science and </v>

1075
00:53:22.940 --> 00:53:24.860
<v Speaker 4>within modern academia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1076
00:53:25.010 --> 00:53:25.670
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's</v>

1077
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:31.010
<v Speaker 3>really interesting to see this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>evolution of these ideas and the </v>

1078
00:53:31.010 --> 00:53:33.090
<v Speaker 3>acceptance of ideas that didn't exist </v>
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>

1079
00:53:33.330 --> 00:53:38.330
<v Speaker 3>But along with the new craziness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the new fat acceptance and you know,</v>

1080
00:53:38.431 --> 00:53:43.431
<v Speaker 3>all this other nonsense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this new politically correct terms in </v>

1081
00:53:43.431 --> 00:53:46.740
<v Speaker 3>this parasitic thinking that you saw </v>
<v Speaker 3>described so well,</v>

1082
00:53:47.490 --> 00:53:51.210
<v Speaker 3>this is the new threat to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to unbiased,</v>

1083
00:53:51.211 --> 00:53:56.211
<v Speaker 3>objective thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely is desired and offend no one </v>

1084
00:53:56.211 --> 00:53:56.550
<v Speaker 3>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

1085
00:53:56.600 --> 00:53:58.900
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

1086
00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:01.260
<v Speaker 3>the reality is that now there's a thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>called,</v>

1087
00:54:01.350 --> 00:54:03.990
<v Speaker 3>have you heard of trigger warnings?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Love it.</v>

1088
00:54:04.890 --> 00:54:07.020
<v Speaker 3>I love them my whole life to trigger </v>
<v Speaker 3>warning.</v>

1089
00:54:07.410 --> 00:54:11.070
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly what I said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to put in my course outline.</v>

1090
00:54:11.460 --> 00:54:14.970
<v Speaker 3>Warning life is a trigger warning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

1091
00:54:15.420 --> 00:54:15.810
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1092
00:54:16.020 --> 00:54:18.000
<v Speaker 3>imagine that it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As a matter of fact,</v>

1093
00:54:18.001 --> 00:54:18.450
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1094
00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:20.640
<v Speaker 3>in my Wellesley talk that I mentioned </v>
<v Speaker 3>earlier,</v>

1095
00:54:20.850 --> 00:54:25.850
<v Speaker 3>I put up a list of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>suggests the suggested topics that these</v>

1096
00:54:27.331 --> 00:54:30.330
<v Speaker 3>trigger warning folks were saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>required trigger warnings.</v>

1097
00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:32.160
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was literally everything.</v>

1098
00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:35.100
<v Speaker 3>That discussion of pregnancy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of sex,</v>

1099
00:54:35.340 --> 00:54:37.380
<v Speaker 3>of disease,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of war,</v>

1100
00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:40.170
<v Speaker 3>of criminality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of mating,</v>

1101
00:54:40.410 --> 00:54:43.640
<v Speaker 3>all of these things could potentially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1102
00:54:43.890 --> 00:54:48.890
<v Speaker 3>cause some distress to somebody and </v>
<v Speaker 3>should therefore come with a trigger </v>

1103
00:54:48.890 --> 00:54:52.941
<v Speaker 3>warning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now for somebody who escaped Lebanon </v>

1104
00:54:52.941 --> 00:54:56.670
<v Speaker 3>under immediate threat of execution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I look at that and say,</v>

1105
00:54:57.061 --> 00:54:57.940
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

1106
00:54:57.941 --> 00:55:02.941
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a decadent society in that if </v>

1107
00:55:02.941 --> 00:55:05.870
<v Speaker 3>that's the things that worry people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they should really go spend a day in the</v>

1108
00:55:06.220 --> 00:55:11.220
<v Speaker 3>neighborhoods where I grew up and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe they'd have a different </v>

1109
00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:12.210
<v Speaker 3>perspective as to what they should be </v>
<v Speaker 3>picketing against.</v>

1110
00:55:12.270 --> 00:55:16.080
<v Speaker 3>I agree entirely in my term is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean my,</v>

1111
00:55:16.110 --> 00:55:21.110
<v Speaker 3>not my term,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my thought is that people are just so </v>

1112
00:55:21.110 --> 00:55:23.670
<v Speaker 3>used to this soft life of everything </v>
<v Speaker 3>being really easy to achieve,</v>

1113
00:55:23.970 --> 00:55:27.840
<v Speaker 3>that they have never developed this </v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding of the,</v>

1114
00:55:27.870 --> 00:55:32.870
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how fortunate we are to be living this </v>

1115
00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:34.950
<v Speaker 3>in this time and age to experience this </v>
<v Speaker 3>easy life that we live in,</v>

1116
00:55:34.951 --> 00:55:37.050
<v Speaker 3>but that we're really lucky.</v>

1117
00:55:37.470 --> 00:55:42.470
<v Speaker 3>We're really lucky and to focus on a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bunch of nonsense and to get carried </v>

1118
00:55:43.921 --> 00:55:48.921
<v Speaker 3>away thinking about all these ultra </v>
<v Speaker 3>supersensitive notions and to dwell on </v>

1119
00:55:50.581 --> 00:55:55.581
<v Speaker 3>them as if in some way you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>make the world a better place by doing </v>

1120
00:55:55.581 --> 00:55:56.070
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's nonsense.</v>

1121
00:55:56.071 --> 00:55:58.590
<v Speaker 3>It's preposterous because it's their </v>
<v Speaker 3>posers.</v>

1122
00:55:58.650 --> 00:56:01.110
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so a way to demonstrate that.</v>

1123
00:56:01.111 --> 00:56:05.120
<v Speaker 3>I care,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in doing it with very little cost,</v>

1124
00:56:05.121 --> 00:56:10.121
<v Speaker 3>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it takes a lot more guts to stand up </v>

1125
00:56:10.121 --> 00:56:12.630
<v Speaker 3>against Islam than to stand up against </v>
<v Speaker 3>some hick evolution,</v>

1126
00:56:12.631 --> 00:56:15.510
<v Speaker 3>denying senator who's Republican.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>

1127
00:56:15.511 --> 00:56:20.511
<v Speaker 3>if I look at my facebook friends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I put up a post that is critical of </v>

1128
00:56:22.081 --> 00:56:25.390
<v Speaker 3>the senator who was a Redneck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a Republican,</v>

1129
00:56:25.900 --> 00:56:30.100
<v Speaker 3>I'll get from my academic colleagues 80 </v>
<v Speaker 3>likes and at some inane,</v>

1130
00:56:30.150 --> 00:56:35.150
<v Speaker 3>silly thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if I put some horrifying reality </v>

1131
00:56:35.150 --> 00:56:37.720
<v Speaker 3>about 200,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>Syrians being butchered,</v>

1132
00:56:38.350 --> 00:56:43.060
<v Speaker 3>they are so loud in their silence </v>
<v Speaker 3>because that's scary.</v>

1133
00:56:43.090 --> 00:56:44.620
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the,</v>

1134
00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:46.960
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the western feminists are very,</v>

1135
00:56:46.961 --> 00:56:51.961
<v Speaker 3>very quick to chastise David Letterman </v>
<v Speaker 3>if he makes a sexist joke or whatever it</v>

1136
00:56:52.541 --> 00:56:55.270
<v Speaker 3>was to his intern that shows great </v>
<v Speaker 3>courage,</v>

1137
00:56:55.500 --> 00:56:59.290
<v Speaker 3>but so to speak against genital </v>
<v Speaker 3>mutilation in the Islamic world or other</v>

1138
00:56:59.291 --> 00:57:03.190
<v Speaker 3>parts of the world or all kinds of other</v>
<v Speaker 3>injustices that women face.</v>

1139
00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:05.140
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we should be quiet about that.</v>

1140
00:57:05.141 --> 00:57:07.840
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at the Ion Hirsi Ali issue.</v>

1141
00:57:07.841 --> 00:57:08.920
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you familiar with that?</v>

1142
00:57:08.940 --> 00:57:09.440
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1143
00:57:09.900 --> 00:57:12.040
<v Speaker 3>Do you know who I am?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hirsi Ali is in Hirsi.</v>

1144
00:57:12.041 --> 00:57:17.041
<v Speaker 3>Ali is a woman who was born into Islam </v>
<v Speaker 3>who escaped an arranged marriage,</v>

1145
00:57:17.201 --> 00:57:19.420
<v Speaker 3>move to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to Netherlands,</v>

1146
00:57:20.020 --> 00:57:25.020
<v Speaker 3>became a Dutch parliamentarian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then was part of a documentary that </v>

1147
00:57:25.020 --> 00:57:26.460
<v Speaker 3>was offensive to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

1148
00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:31.680
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some Muslims and then she had to have </v>

1149
00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:31.680
<v Speaker 3>then protection for the rest of her </v>
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>

1150
00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:36.210
<v Speaker 3>now has moved to the United States and </v>
<v Speaker 3>has spent pretty much her entire career </v>

1151
00:57:36.210 --> 00:57:37.870
<v Speaker 3>fighting for the rights of women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just Muslim women,</v>

1152
00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:41.200
<v Speaker 3>women in general,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but of course many Muslim women in those</v>

1153
00:57:41.201 --> 00:57:42.880
<v Speaker 3>areas are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are mistreated.</v>

1154
00:57:43.300 --> 00:57:46.000
<v Speaker 3>So Brandeis University,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sites to bestow her,</v>

1155
00:57:46.030 --> 00:57:47.500
<v Speaker 3>this is very recently,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a couple of months ago,</v>

1156
00:57:47.501 --> 00:57:49.570
<v Speaker 3>but still bestow her a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

1157
00:57:49.571 --> 00:57:54.571
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe honorary doctorate or speech </v>

1158
00:57:54.571 --> 00:57:57.481
<v Speaker 3>convocation to speak at the convocation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then all of the professors rallied </v>

1159
00:57:58.630 --> 00:58:03.630
<v Speaker 3>against this woman who is speaking on </v>
<v Speaker 3>behalf of half the population called </v>

1160
00:58:04.661 --> 00:58:05.740
<v Speaker 3>women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1161
00:58:06.280 --> 00:58:09.910
<v Speaker 3>And they said this is a hate monger and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Islamophobic,</v>

1162
00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:10.300
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>

1163
00:58:10.301 --> 00:58:12.550
<v Speaker 3>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so they rescinded her invitation.</v>

1164
00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:14.380
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there you go.</v>

1165
00:58:15.250 --> 00:58:16.680
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1166
00:58:16.710 --> 00:58:21.710
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're pretty much lost as a society if </v>

1167
00:58:21.710 --> 00:58:25.270
<v Speaker 3>we can't identify who the heroes are and</v>
<v Speaker 3>who is on the right side of each issue,</v>

1168
00:58:25.290 --> 00:58:26.530
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not just that,</v>

1169
00:58:26.531 --> 00:58:28.750
<v Speaker 3>but the educators are the ones that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>having this issue.</v>

1170
00:58:28.780 --> 00:58:33.780
<v Speaker 3>The educators are the ones that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>having a hard time recognizing who's on </v>

1171
00:58:33.780 --> 00:58:36.781
<v Speaker 3>the right side of things that I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's one very important thing that </v>

1172
00:58:36.781 --> 00:58:37.160
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1173
00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:40.060
<v Speaker 3>you brought up and it's the social </v>
<v Speaker 3>aspect,</v>

1174
00:58:40.270 --> 00:58:45.270
<v Speaker 3>the social gratification,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's social reward aspect of </v>

1175
00:58:45.270 --> 00:58:49.951
<v Speaker 3>supporting things that we all agree upon</v>
<v Speaker 3>that these Hicks senators are bad,</v>

1176
00:58:50.820 --> 00:58:55.300
<v Speaker 3>that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then the scariness of Islam,</v>

1177
00:58:55.520 --> 00:59:00.520
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the scariness of criticizing the Muslim </v>

1178
00:59:00.520 --> 00:59:00.520
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

1179
00:59:00.520 --> 00:59:02.380
<v Speaker 3>And then this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this concept of Islamophobia that's sort</v>

1180
00:59:02.381 --> 00:59:07.381
<v Speaker 3>of gotten to people's minds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that thing that people do where they</v>

1181
00:59:07.930 --> 00:59:10.660
<v Speaker 3>seek out what I call socially </v>
<v Speaker 3>Progressive Brownie points.</v>

1182
00:59:10.750 --> 00:59:14.560
<v Speaker 3>Exactly like men who declare themselves </v>
<v Speaker 3>openly feminists,</v>

1183
00:59:14.830 --> 00:59:16.600
<v Speaker 3>male feminists like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1184
00:59:16.690 --> 00:59:21.690
<v Speaker 3>I'm a humanist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe that we are all just brothers </v>

1185
00:59:22.131 --> 00:59:23.810
<v Speaker 3>and sisters on this planet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of us,</v>

1186
00:59:24.050 --> 00:59:26.180
<v Speaker 3>including people and other cultures and </v>
<v Speaker 3>countries.</v>

1187
00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:29.690
<v Speaker 3>And I'm not a nationalist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's all nonsense.</v>

1188
00:59:29.691 --> 00:59:34.691
<v Speaker 3>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I would love it if we could all </v>

1189
00:59:34.691 --> 00:59:36.880
<v Speaker 3>understand each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it would make a lot more sense </v>

1190
00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:37.850
<v Speaker 3>if we spoke one language so I could </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand people in China,</v>

1191
00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:43.120
<v Speaker 3>but I don't feel about them any </v>
<v Speaker 3>differently than I feel about a guy </v>

1192
00:59:43.120 --> 00:59:44.330
<v Speaker 3>lives down the street.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I try very hard to work on that.</v>

1193
00:59:44.540 --> 00:59:49.540
<v Speaker 3>So when I get this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this thing where people start </v>

1194
00:59:49.540 --> 00:59:53.800
<v Speaker 3>identifying with one gender and one </v>
<v Speaker 3>gender specifically and there's another </v>

1195
00:59:53.800 --> 00:59:58.451
<v Speaker 3>thing that men are doing where they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>not only proclaiming themselves as a </v>

1196
00:59:58.451 --> 01:00:01.550
<v Speaker 3>male feminist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're also saying that if they are</v>

1197
01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:06.640
<v Speaker 3>unjustly accused of something that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>would happily be unjustly accused of </v>

1198
01:00:07.671 --> 01:00:11.780
<v Speaker 3>something if it could somehow another </v>
<v Speaker 3>prevent women from being persecuted.</v>

1199
01:00:11.830 --> 01:00:15.710
<v Speaker 3>What martyrs in that amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're so cool and strong like that,</v>

1200
01:00:16.010 --> 01:00:21.010
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you know the term </v>

1201
01:00:21.010 --> 01:00:21.170
<v Speaker 3>identity politics is that I've heard the</v>
<v Speaker 3>term,</v>

1202
01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:26.440
<v Speaker 3>so basically you have sort of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>balkanization of different identity </v>

1203
01:00:26.931 --> 01:00:31.220
<v Speaker 3>groups and there is what's called a </v>
<v Speaker 3>poker identity game.</v>

1204
01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:36.340
<v Speaker 3>You know which,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which identity group has larger </v>

1205
01:00:36.340 --> 01:00:39.641
<v Speaker 3>victimology and greater grievances and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the top group that you really can't </v>

1206
01:00:39.861 --> 01:00:42.500
<v Speaker 3>touch our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our people of the Muslim faith.</v>

1207
01:00:42.530 --> 01:00:46.950
<v Speaker 3>What about Islamic transgender male </v>
<v Speaker 3>feminist that that's.</v>

1208
01:00:46.990 --> 01:00:51.990
<v Speaker 3>That's the royal flush.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's you're holding the royal flush </v>

1209
01:00:51.990 --> 01:00:52.020
<v Speaker 3>right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're a fucking.</v>

1210
01:00:52.700 --> 01:00:57.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't be beat and you've got five </v>

1211
01:00:57.700 --> 01:00:59.951
<v Speaker 3>jokers at my university and my </v>
<v Speaker 3>university right now in Montreal.</v>

1212
01:01:00.531 --> 01:01:05.531
<v Speaker 3>At one point I sat precisely because </v>
<v Speaker 3>people had a sense of some of the </v>

1213
01:01:05.531 --> 01:01:08.621
<v Speaker 3>positions I held.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They asked me to come in and sit on a </v>

1214
01:01:08.621 --> 01:01:08.690
<v Speaker 3>religious accommodation committee.</v>

1215
01:01:09.950 --> 01:01:14.950
<v Speaker 3>We're a secular university in a secular </v>
<v Speaker 3>society officially as the official law.</v>

1216
01:01:15.350 --> 01:01:20.350
<v Speaker 3>So what does it mean to say that we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to now enact a religious </v>

1217
01:01:20.350 --> 01:01:24.611
<v Speaker 3>accommodation policy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's like saying I am a virgin </v>

1218
01:01:24.611 --> 01:01:27.491
<v Speaker 3>but I'm pregnant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's really the term can't make </v>

1219
01:01:27.491 --> 01:01:27.491
<v Speaker 3>sense how.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1220
01:01:27.491 --> 01:01:32.020
<v Speaker 3>So my position was I am equally non </v>
<v Speaker 3>pliant to anybody's religious beliefs.</v>

1221
01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:37.030
<v Speaker 3>If Jews come to my class and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we want to do young people,</v>

1222
01:01:37.100 --> 01:01:37.430
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>

1223
01:01:37.431 --> 01:01:42.431
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I'm Jewish and I'm still going to </v>

1224
01:01:42.431 --> 01:01:44.951
<v Speaker 3>come to the lecture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now if Moslems come and say we want </v>

1225
01:01:44.951 --> 01:01:47.780
<v Speaker 3>to take Hash for three weeks at Mecca so</v>
<v Speaker 3>we won't be showing up to your class for</v>

1226
01:01:47.781 --> 01:01:48.950
<v Speaker 3>three weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1227
01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:52.340
<v Speaker 3>I'm equally unreceptive that idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1228
01:01:52.490 --> 01:01:57.490
<v Speaker 3>it seemed like most people were pretty </v>
<v Speaker 3>happy with my general position as long </v>

1229
01:01:57.490 --> 01:01:58.430
<v Speaker 3>as it didn't apply to this one </v>
<v Speaker 3>particular group.</v>

1230
01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:00.530
<v Speaker 3>Now that suicidal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1231
01:02:00.531 --> 01:02:05.531
<v Speaker 3>That can't be because that's already </v>
<v Speaker 3>institutionalizing the fact that people </v>

1232
01:02:05.531 --> 01:02:06.980
<v Speaker 3>are not all equal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1233
01:02:07.070 --> 01:02:11.540
<v Speaker 3>Some people deserve more accommodations </v>
<v Speaker 3>than others.</v>

1234
01:02:11.570 --> 01:02:12.710
<v Speaker 3>That's dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1235
01:02:13.070 --> 01:02:16.670
<v Speaker 3>That's so in the US.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Freedom of religion also includes,</v>

1236
01:02:16.671 --> 01:02:17.780
<v Speaker 3>as you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's a cliche.</v>

1237
01:02:17.810 --> 01:02:20.130
<v Speaker 3>Freedom from religion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>be religious,</v>

1238
01:02:20.190 --> 01:02:25.190
<v Speaker 3>just don't put it in my face,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think in our desperate desire to </v>

1239
01:02:25.190 --> 01:02:26.760
<v Speaker 3>constantly accommodate people would </v>
<v Speaker 3>going down the wrong path,</v>

1240
01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:29.370
<v Speaker 3>but not just constantly accommodate </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

1241
01:02:29.371 --> 01:02:33.060
<v Speaker 3>but accommodate people that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>perceived to have been persecuted,</v>

1242
01:02:33.090 --> 01:02:38.090
<v Speaker 3>only not accommodate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People that have a contrary point of </v>

1243
01:02:38.090 --> 01:02:42.051
<v Speaker 3>view,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not debate them or look at them all </v>

1244
01:02:42.051 --> 01:02:42.630
<v Speaker 3>objectively true and consider all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>various possibilities.</v>

1245
01:02:42.780 --> 01:02:47.780
<v Speaker 3>Have we been incorrect in our thinking?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is this a possible like the woman that </v>

1246
01:02:47.780 --> 01:02:48.060
<v Speaker 3>you were talking about that from </v>
<v Speaker 3>Brandeis.</v>

1247
01:02:48.061 --> 01:02:48.480
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

1248
01:02:48.740 --> 01:02:53.740
<v Speaker 3>that's unbelievably shocking for someone</v>
<v Speaker 3>who have gone through something so </v>

1249
01:02:53.740 --> 01:02:56.040
<v Speaker 3>horrifying to be escaping running for </v>
<v Speaker 3>their life,</v>

1250
01:02:56.070 --> 01:03:00.310
<v Speaker 3>really escaping to America and then to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be called an Islamophobia.</v>

1251
01:03:00.330 --> 01:03:02.100
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And as you said,</v>

1252
01:03:02.340 --> 01:03:05.880
<v Speaker 3>who is spearheading that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The professors and by the way,</v>

1253
01:03:05.881 --> 01:03:07.980
<v Speaker 3>Brandeis University,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you may know,</v>

1254
01:03:08.130 --> 01:03:13.130
<v Speaker 3>was founded by a liberal a lot by </v>
<v Speaker 3>brandeis who was trying to kind of found</v>

1255
01:03:14.911 --> 01:03:19.911
<v Speaker 3>an institution that would be open to all</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would be pluralistic precisely </v>

1256
01:03:19.911 --> 01:03:23.240
<v Speaker 3>because of some of the antisemitism that</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jewish students would have faced at some</v>

1257
01:03:23.241 --> 01:03:28.241
<v Speaker 3>of the sort of northeastern schools.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the school is founded on these </v>

1258
01:03:28.241 --> 01:03:32.451
<v Speaker 3>principles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then at the first opportunity you </v>

1259
01:03:32.451 --> 01:03:34.761
<v Speaker 3>violate everything that you stand for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there any movement to try to change </v>

1260
01:03:34.761 --> 01:03:35.850
<v Speaker 3>this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there any discussion to try to,</v>

1261
01:03:36.530 --> 01:03:40.720
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this sort of real issue with academia as</v>

1262
01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:43.260
<v Speaker 3>well?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I can be a modest,</v>

1263
01:03:43.261 --> 01:03:46.010
<v Speaker 3>I think it's guys like me who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying,</v>

1264
01:03:46.110 --> 01:03:51.110
<v Speaker 3>who are really in the wilderness who try</v>
<v Speaker 3>to come out of the woodworks and have </v>

1265
01:03:51.110 --> 01:03:54.090
<v Speaker 3>the courage and the big festivals to try</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do that,</v>

1266
01:03:54.091 --> 01:03:56.790
<v Speaker 3>but I think most people have heard </v>
<v Speaker 3>instinct,</v>

1267
01:03:56.791 --> 01:03:59.070
<v Speaker 3>but even if you say that you have the </v>
<v Speaker 3>testicles to do this,</v>

1268
01:03:59.071 --> 01:03:59.670
<v Speaker 3>how dare you.</v>

1269
01:03:59.670 --> 01:04:03.180
<v Speaker 3>You can't do this with ovaries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that what you're saying?</v>

1270
01:04:04.670 --> 01:04:07.390
<v Speaker 3>I apologize for having said that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have testicle now.</v>

1271
01:04:07.430 --> 01:04:09.690
<v Speaker 3>It's this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an expression of courage.</v>

1272
01:04:09.691 --> 01:04:12.570
<v Speaker 3>Women have balls too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know a lot of checks with balls if you</v>

1273
01:04:12.571 --> 01:04:14.880
<v Speaker 3>look at it that way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's unfortunate that a woman has to</v>

1274
01:04:14.910 --> 01:04:15.900
<v Speaker 3>hear that and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh well,</v>

1275
01:04:15.901 --> 01:04:18.260
<v Speaker 3>great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's associated with male gender have.</v>

1276
01:04:18.390 --> 01:04:20.970
<v Speaker 3>Well that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if a guy is a great guy,</v>

1277
01:04:20.971 --> 01:04:22.020
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy's the tits.</v>

1278
01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:25.050
<v Speaker 3>I mean that is something that people say</v>
<v Speaker 3>to like my friend Steve,</v>

1279
01:04:25.051 --> 01:04:30.051
<v Speaker 3>he says every everything is good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He calls titties titties movie man.</v>

1280
01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:35.400
<v Speaker 3>Like I used to be a competitive soccer </v>
<v Speaker 3>player and the kind of trash talking </v>

1281
01:04:37.951 --> 01:04:42.951
<v Speaker 3>that would happen as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you would know your athlete is </v>

1282
01:04:42.951 --> 01:04:45.460
<v Speaker 3>astounding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The things that would be sad for example</v>

1283
01:04:45.461 --> 01:04:49.560
<v Speaker 3>of calling you some homophobic slur name</v>
<v Speaker 3>go to move,</v>

1284
01:04:49.561 --> 01:04:49.830
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1285
01:04:49.860 --> 01:04:51.120
<v Speaker 3>Or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or calling you.</v>

1286
01:04:51.121 --> 01:04:56.121
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember at one point I played in the </v>

1287
01:04:56.121 --> 01:04:56.850
<v Speaker 3>league called the Black Lake where you </v>
<v Speaker 3>would only to not to non black guys.</v>

1288
01:04:57.240 --> 01:04:58.920
<v Speaker 3>I was one of them and so they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1289
01:04:58.930 --> 01:05:00.870
<v Speaker 3>I would if somebody with tackling and </v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

1290
01:05:00.871 --> 01:05:02.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stop whining,</v>

1291
01:05:02.221 --> 01:05:05.940
<v Speaker 3>get up white bitch right now in today's </v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

1292
01:05:05.970 --> 01:05:10.970
<v Speaker 3>Usually the way I fought that as I say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to get by this guy next </v>

1293
01:05:11.491 --> 01:05:13.230
<v Speaker 3>time around and I'm going to score a </v>
<v Speaker 3>goal.</v>

1294
01:05:13.260 --> 01:05:15.900
<v Speaker 3>I didn't kind of curl into a fetal </v>
<v Speaker 3>position.</v>

1295
01:05:15.901 --> 01:05:17.980
<v Speaker 3>Start crying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well today they are.</v>

1296
01:05:18.520 --> 01:05:21.610
<v Speaker 3>I mean facetiously that are commissar </v>
<v Speaker 3>standing around the field,</v>

1297
01:05:21.820 --> 01:05:24.040
<v Speaker 3>making sure that nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>others,</v>

1298
01:05:24.041 --> 01:05:29.041
<v Speaker 3>any of these slur words because then you</v>
<v Speaker 3>could be taken to hate speech code </v>

1299
01:05:29.041 --> 01:05:31.900
<v Speaker 3>tribunal mean in Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have hate speech laws.</v>

1300
01:05:32.210 --> 01:05:33.100
<v Speaker 3>They.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How could that be?</v>

1301
01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:33.670
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>

1302
01:05:33.671 --> 01:05:38.671
<v Speaker 3>I'm not suggesting that we should all be</v>
<v Speaker 3>insulting one another and of course we </v>

1303
01:05:38.671 --> 01:05:38.980
<v Speaker 3>should all be kind and gentle to each </v>
<v Speaker 3>other,</v>

1304
01:05:39.220 --> 01:05:42.460
<v Speaker 3>but the idea that if you tell me a white</v>
<v Speaker 3>bitch,</v>

1305
01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:47.520
<v Speaker 3>I could actually impose upon you to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>to a hate speech tribunals is </v>

1306
01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:48.100
<v Speaker 3>astounding.</v>

1307
01:05:48.130 --> 01:05:48.410
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

1308
01:05:48.610 --> 01:05:53.610
<v Speaker 3>What's freedom of speech?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Freedom of speech is the right to also </v>

1309
01:05:53.610 --> 01:05:53.610
<v Speaker 3>be an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>

1310
01:05:53.610 --> 01:05:58.400
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but unfortunately now everything is </v>

1311
01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:01.111
<v Speaker 3>sanitized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything is just freedom of speech is </v>

1312
01:06:01.111 --> 01:06:01.180
<v Speaker 3>the right to be an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But on,</v>

1313
01:06:01.230 --> 01:06:03.550
<v Speaker 3>in other terms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>freedom of speech,</v>

1314
01:06:03.580 --> 01:06:08.580
<v Speaker 3>on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in response to your being an asshole is </v>

1315
01:06:08.580 --> 01:06:11.941
<v Speaker 3>the right to ostracize you like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>right to get you out of social groups </v>

1316
01:06:11.941 --> 01:06:13.270
<v Speaker 3>and that's how you recognize asphalts </v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly,</v>

1317
01:06:13.271 --> 01:06:18.271
<v Speaker 3>but when you sanitize the world and </v>
<v Speaker 3>remove half the language and put trigger</v>

1318
01:06:18.701 --> 01:06:20.380
<v Speaker 3>warnings out for everything that </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody says,</v>

1319
01:06:20.740 --> 01:06:23.650
<v Speaker 3>it's very difficult to get to the heart </v>
<v Speaker 3>of what someone's trying to communicate,</v>

1320
01:06:23.651 --> 01:06:25.990
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When we're making mouth noises,</v>

1321
01:06:26.050 --> 01:06:30.640
<v Speaker 3>trying to express our thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we're limited in such an amazing way</v>

1322
01:06:30.641 --> 01:06:32.770
<v Speaker 3>by so many different forms of </v>
<v Speaker 3>expression.</v>

1323
01:06:33.060 --> 01:06:33.510
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

1324
01:06:33.590 --> 01:06:38.590
<v Speaker 3>here's a great example that's happening </v>
<v Speaker 3>all over the West and certainly in </v>

1325
01:06:38.590 --> 01:06:42.151
<v Speaker 3>Canada and the US try to give a lecture </v>
<v Speaker 3>or invite somebody either that has a pro</v>

1326
01:06:43.540 --> 01:06:48.540
<v Speaker 3>Israel position or an anti Islam </v>
<v Speaker 3>position and go to UC Irvine and see </v>

1327
01:06:49.241 --> 01:06:49.780
<v Speaker 3>what happens.</v>

1328
01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:51.000
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1329
01:06:51.001 --> 01:06:53.590
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the former ambassador of Israel tried to</v>

1330
01:06:53.591 --> 01:06:57.490
<v Speaker 3>come and give a lecture and I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't an incendiary thing.</v>

1331
01:06:57.491 --> 01:07:02.491
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't going to be saying some </v>
<v Speaker 3>horribly controversial things and yet </v>

1332
01:07:02.491 --> 01:07:05.170
<v Speaker 3>they tried to shut them down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Benjamin Netanyahu,</v>

1333
01:07:05.171 --> 01:07:10.030
<v Speaker 3>the current prime minister of Israel was</v>
<v Speaker 3>shut down at my university.</v>

1334
01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:13.030
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At Concordia University in Montreal,</v>

1335
01:07:13.300 --> 01:07:18.300
<v Speaker 3>the Prime Minister of a democratic </v>
<v Speaker 3>elected government are only supposed to </v>

1336
01:07:19.450 --> 01:07:24.450
<v Speaker 3>true ally in the Middle East was unable </v>
<v Speaker 3>to speak because there was great a </v>

1337
01:07:25.090 --> 01:07:29.380
<v Speaker 3>threat of danger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now that's a v astonishingly dangerous,</v>

1338
01:07:29.381 --> 01:07:29.740
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1339
01:07:29.741 --> 01:07:30.100
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

1340
01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:34.450
<v Speaker 3>if that guy can't speak,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably you and I are not going to have</v>

1341
01:07:34.451 --> 01:07:37.000
<v Speaker 3>much of a voice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a university in Toronto,</v>

1342
01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:42.360
<v Speaker 3>I forget which one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there was a speech by a guy who was </v>

1343
01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:44.810
<v Speaker 3>considered to be a men's rights advocate</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the,</v>

1344
01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:48.130
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the insult as they call them Mras and he</v>

1345
01:07:48.131 --> 01:07:53.131
<v Speaker 3>had written a book and he was giving the</v>
<v Speaker 3>speech and these feminists were </v>

1346
01:07:53.131 --> 01:07:54.100
<v Speaker 3>protesting and York University was at </v>
<v Speaker 3>York.</v>

1347
01:07:54.130 --> 01:07:58.260
<v Speaker 3>I think it was your and violent </v>
<v Speaker 3>opposition and what he had,</v>

1348
01:07:58.600 --> 01:08:01.390
<v Speaker 3>what they had said that he said and what</v>
<v Speaker 3>he actually said.</v>

1349
01:08:01.510 --> 01:08:06.510
<v Speaker 3>It was so completely diametrically op.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean was so incorrect that it was </v>

1350
01:08:06.941 --> 01:08:08.920
<v Speaker 3>almost like they'd never read what he </v>
<v Speaker 3>had said.</v>

1351
01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:12.730
<v Speaker 3>They had just decided that this was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>target because he was a.</v>

1352
01:08:12.820 --> 01:08:17.820
<v Speaker 3>He was an example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a figurehead of the patriarchy </v>

1353
01:08:17.820 --> 01:08:20.590
<v Speaker 3>and so they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These people were showing up for these </v>

1354
01:08:20.590 --> 01:08:20.590
<v Speaker 3>lectures like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1355
01:08:20.590 --> 01:08:20.590
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1356
01:08:20.590 --> 01:08:22.670
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I read websites that I don't agree with.</v>

1357
01:08:22.671 --> 01:08:27.290
<v Speaker 3>I watch a republican debates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I watch.</v>

1358
01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:33.040
<v Speaker 3>I watched these bizarre Republican Fox </v>
<v Speaker 3>News talk shows where they have these </v>

1359
01:08:33.561 --> 01:08:35.870
<v Speaker 3>insane views of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't agree with them.</v>

1360
01:08:35.990 --> 01:08:40.990
<v Speaker 3>I watch it because I'm fascinated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I watch it because I want to know what </v>

1361
01:08:40.990 --> 01:08:41.050
<v Speaker 3>this knucklehead thinks about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1362
01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:42.440
<v Speaker 3>God and climate change.</v>

1363
01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:44.540
<v Speaker 3>God has a great sense of humor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1364
01:08:44.541 --> 01:08:45.890
<v Speaker 3>look the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have we.</v>

1365
01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:47.840
<v Speaker 3>We played a video the other day of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>woman who's.</v>

1366
01:08:47.930 --> 01:08:50.180
<v Speaker 3>She's running for Congress.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy bitch.</v>

1367
01:08:50.210 --> 01:08:51.180
<v Speaker 3>She,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was.</v>

1368
01:08:51.310 --> 01:08:56.310
<v Speaker 3>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can prove there's no global warming </v>

1369
01:08:56.310 --> 01:08:56.330
<v Speaker 3>with a simple tool,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a thermometer,</v>

1370
01:08:56.720 --> 01:08:59.360
<v Speaker 3>and she pulls it out like I'm fascinated</v>
<v Speaker 3>by that lady.</v>

1371
01:08:59.361 --> 01:09:01.070
<v Speaker 3>I will watch that lady talk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mean I'm.</v>

1372
01:09:01.110 --> 01:09:03.080
<v Speaker 3>I agreed with her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So these,</v>

1373
01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:05.360
<v Speaker 3>these feminists is radical feminists as </v>
<v Speaker 3>it were.</v>

1374
01:09:05.530 --> 01:09:06.860
<v Speaker 3>Whatever your radical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

1375
01:09:06.950 --> 01:09:10.460
<v Speaker 3>anything we usually an idiot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but these radical feminists,</v>

1376
01:09:10.461 --> 01:09:12.890
<v Speaker 3>we're keeping people from attending </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

1377
01:09:13.010 --> 01:09:15.760
<v Speaker 3>Not just the people that were speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1378
01:09:15.860 --> 01:09:18.140
<v Speaker 3>they weren't protesting the people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>were speaking,</v>

1379
01:09:18.290 --> 01:09:21.120
<v Speaker 3>they were screaming and yelling at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>people they're trying to go into,</v>

1380
01:09:21.140 --> 01:09:23.750
<v Speaker 3>listen to this person talk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>agree or disagree.</v>

1381
01:09:23.751 --> 01:09:28.751
<v Speaker 3>The idea that you are trying to oppose </v>
<v Speaker 3>or trying to stop you are in opposition </v>

1382
01:09:29.420 --> 01:09:32.720
<v Speaker 3>of a person listening to a contrary </v>
<v Speaker 3>point of view.</v>

1383
01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:34.130
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1384
01:09:34.131 --> 01:09:36.140
<v Speaker 3>I already dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very dangerous.</v>

1385
01:09:36.141 --> 01:09:39.110
<v Speaker 3>I wrote an article on my psychology </v>
<v Speaker 3>today blog,</v>

1386
01:09:39.111 --> 01:09:44.111
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe about two years ago where this </v>

1387
01:09:44.111 --> 01:09:45.910
<v Speaker 3>wasn't my study.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just simply summarizing somebody </v>

1388
01:09:45.910 --> 01:09:46.610
<v Speaker 3>else's work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what he had basically done,</v>

1389
01:09:46.611 --> 01:09:48.020
<v Speaker 3>or I think there were several </v>
<v Speaker 3>researchers,</v>

1390
01:09:48.021 --> 01:09:53.021
<v Speaker 3>they had looked at the political </v>
<v Speaker 3>leanings of professors at American </v>

1391
01:09:53.691 --> 01:09:55.590
<v Speaker 3>universities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1392
01:09:55.610 --> 01:10:00.610
<v Speaker 3>whether they're Democrat or Republican </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they actually then broke it down by </v>

1393
01:10:00.860 --> 01:10:02.270
<v Speaker 3>departments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>

1394
01:10:02.271 --> 01:10:07.271
<v Speaker 3>what would be the Democrat versus </v>
<v Speaker 3>Republican ratio in sociology versus in </v>

1395
01:10:07.271 --> 01:10:11.620
<v Speaker 3>physics?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What they found is that I think if I'm </v>

1396
01:10:11.620 --> 01:10:14.771
<v Speaker 3>going on memory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that the ratio is about five to </v>

1397
01:10:14.771 --> 01:10:17.531
<v Speaker 3>one Democrat to Republican and in some </v>
<v Speaker 3>departments,</v>

1398
01:10:17.930 --> 01:10:19.640
<v Speaker 3>most notably,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

1399
01:10:19.641 --> 01:10:21.920
<v Speaker 3>in the humanities and sociology and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

1400
01:10:21.980 --> 01:10:24.670
<v Speaker 3>it was 44 to one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I,</v>

1401
01:10:24.820 --> 01:10:27.290
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't present this as this is good or</v>

1402
01:10:27.291 --> 01:10:32.291
<v Speaker 3>this is bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I certainly was trying to make the </v>

1403
01:10:32.291 --> 01:10:33.590
<v Speaker 3>point that on some issues that's not a </v>
<v Speaker 3>good idea.</v>

1404
01:10:33.650 --> 01:10:36.170
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what should be fiscal policy,</v>

1405
01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:37.530
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1406
01:10:37.550 --> 01:10:39.590
<v Speaker 3>what should be our position regarding </v>
<v Speaker 3>immigration.</v>

1407
01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:40.590
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1408
01:10:40.610 --> 01:10:42.440
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is the position regarding the death</v>

1409
01:10:42.441 --> 01:10:47.441
<v Speaker 3>penalty?</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are not clear sort of </v>

1410
01:10:47.441 --> 01:10:47.441
<v Speaker 3>scientifically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1411
01:10:47.441 --> 01:10:47.441
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1412
01:10:47.441 --> 01:10:50.980
<v Speaker 3>it depends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And to have a sanitized campus,</v>

1413
01:10:51.290 --> 01:10:54.350
<v Speaker 3>we're only one group of people really </v>
<v Speaker 3>dominate.</v>

1414
01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:56.690
<v Speaker 3>I thought was dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should've seen the blowback.</v>

1415
01:10:56.691 --> 01:10:58.570
<v Speaker 3>I got there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1416
01:10:58.970 --> 01:11:03.350
<v Speaker 3>the only thing that protects me in such </v>
<v Speaker 3>situations is that being Canadian,</v>

1417
01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:08.680
<v Speaker 3>I could say these things without </v>
<v Speaker 3>appearing as though I have a dog in the </v>

1418
01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:08.680
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

1419
01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:10.910
<v Speaker 3>I'm not Democrat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm Republican Canadian,</v>

1420
01:11:11.180 --> 01:11:16.180
<v Speaker 3>so I must be unbiased and in a sense </v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll give me a bit of a get out of </v>

1421
01:11:16.180 --> 01:11:18.810
<v Speaker 3>jail card because I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't appear as though I'm fighting</v>

1422
01:11:18.811 --> 01:11:23.811
<v Speaker 3>for one or the other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but still the blow back was astonishing </v>

1423
01:11:23.811 --> 01:11:25.320
<v Speaker 3>because how dare I point to this as </v>
<v Speaker 3>though it were a bad thing.</v>

1424
01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:30.320
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody knows that every Democrat is </v>

1425
01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:31.560
<v Speaker 3>perfect on everything and every </v>
<v Speaker 3>Republican is an idiot,</v>

1426
01:11:31.590 --> 01:11:33.690
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>toothless evolution,</v>

1427
01:11:33.691 --> 01:11:38.691
<v Speaker 3>denying buffoon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that strikes me as astonishing from </v>

1428
01:11:38.691 --> 01:11:39.960
<v Speaker 3>otherwise intelligent people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The world is more nuanced,</v>

1429
01:11:39.961 --> 01:11:44.961
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are many issues on which I agree </v>

1430
01:11:44.961 --> 01:11:47.061
<v Speaker 3>with Democrats as a Canadian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are a few issues on which I </v>

1431
01:11:47.061 --> 01:11:47.610
<v Speaker 3>actually agree more with Republicans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1432
01:11:47.700 --> 01:11:49.830
<v Speaker 3>and so I kind of pick and choose my </v>
<v Speaker 3>battles,</v>

1433
01:11:50.220 --> 01:11:54.450
<v Speaker 3>but that's not how it is in academia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in their defense though,</v>

1434
01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:59.640
<v Speaker 3>the points that are taken by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Republicans so often are there really,</v>

1435
01:12:01.410 --> 01:12:04.740
<v Speaker 3>if you had to choose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like one side that's paying attention to</v>

1436
01:12:04.741 --> 01:12:07.510
<v Speaker 3>science and one side that's paying </v>
<v Speaker 3>attention to religion,</v>

1437
01:12:07.511 --> 01:12:10.050
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty clear except well listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm going to have solutionist.</v>

1438
01:12:10.051 --> 01:12:12.360
<v Speaker 3>So obviously when it's going to come on </v>
<v Speaker 3>that issue,</v>

1439
01:12:12.660 --> 01:12:15.180
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be a lot more with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Democrats then all the.</v>

1440
01:12:15.540 --> 01:12:17.880
<v Speaker 3>But for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my position,</v>

1441
01:12:17.881 --> 01:12:19.590
<v Speaker 3>you may disagree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope you don't kick me out of here.</v>

1442
01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:23.040
<v Speaker 3>I will never take you out of your very </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of the death penalty.</v>

1443
01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:28.760
<v Speaker 3>I think that if you are having raped and</v>
<v Speaker 3>killed 10 children and we've got the DNA</v>

1444
01:12:28.830 --> 01:12:31.170
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of you on the potential,</v>

1445
01:12:31.220 --> 01:12:33.930
<v Speaker 3>it's incontrovertible that you are </v>
<v Speaker 3>guilty.</v>

1446
01:12:34.340 --> 01:12:39.340
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't see it as a terrible moral issue</v>

1447
01:12:39.870 --> 01:12:43.200
<v Speaker 3>that we could potentially discuss the </v>
<v Speaker 3>possibility of executing you.</v>

1448
01:12:43.260 --> 01:12:45.150
<v Speaker 3>As a matter of fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that in some cases,</v>

1449
01:12:45.420 --> 01:12:49.380
<v Speaker 3>the amount of rights that we give to </v>
<v Speaker 3>otherwise horrifying monsters,</v>

1450
01:12:49.381 --> 01:12:52.290
<v Speaker 3>that itself is barbaric.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So on that dimension,</v>

1451
01:12:52.350 --> 01:12:56.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm likely to be much more quote </v>
<v Speaker 3>Republican and I am as well.</v>

1452
01:12:56.430 --> 01:13:01.430
<v Speaker 3>I agree with you 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So know nuance thinking is as a mark of </v>

1453
01:13:01.430 --> 01:13:03.030
<v Speaker 3>somebody who kind of has a sense of what</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world looks like.</v>

1454
01:13:03.330 --> 01:13:08.330
<v Speaker 3>And I think that that's also a mark of </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone who doesn't have a dog in the </v>

1455
01:13:08.330 --> 01:13:08.820
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As I said before.</v>

1456
01:13:09.030 --> 01:13:14.030
<v Speaker 3>I think when you look at the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of variables that must be </v>

1457
01:13:14.030 --> 01:13:18.291
<v Speaker 3>taken into consideration as soon as you </v>
<v Speaker 3>deny those variables because you have a </v>

1458
01:13:18.291 --> 01:13:20.340
<v Speaker 3>specific stance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a predetermined pattern of thinking</v>

1459
01:13:20.341 --> 01:13:24.300
<v Speaker 3>that you've aligned yourself with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm on the left and as a Democrat,</v>

1460
01:13:24.530 --> 01:13:29.530
<v Speaker 3>like I was having a conversation with </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone the other day and they were </v>

1461
01:13:29.530 --> 01:13:31.581
<v Speaker 3>talking to you about upcoming elections </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they said if we lose the house,</v>

1462
01:13:31.711 --> 01:13:34.110
<v Speaker 3>if we lose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he's a fucking comedian.</v>

1463
01:13:34.740 --> 01:13:39.740
<v Speaker 3>He's a comedian that I'm talking to and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's talking about the Democrats and </v>

1464
01:13:39.740 --> 01:13:40.080
<v Speaker 3>he's on team.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

1465
01:13:40.081 --> 01:13:43.310
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm 100 percent for the death penalty in</v>

1466
01:13:43.311 --> 01:13:46.050
<v Speaker 3>terms in like a Ted Bundy type </v>
<v Speaker 3>character.</v>

1467
01:13:46.051 --> 01:13:48.570
<v Speaker 3>Some monster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But my problem with it,</v>

1468
01:13:48.571 --> 01:13:53.571
<v Speaker 3>my number one problem with it is that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't believe that the system is a good </v>

1469
01:13:54.151 --> 01:13:54.930
<v Speaker 3>system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

1470
01:13:54.990 --> 01:13:59.990
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe it's an infallible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a lot of issues when it </v>

1471
01:13:59.990 --> 01:14:03.510
<v Speaker 3>comes to people who are prosecutors who </v>
<v Speaker 3>deny evidence,</v>

1472
01:14:03.511 --> 01:14:05.170
<v Speaker 3>withhold evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

1473
01:14:05.180 --> 01:14:10.180
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they know that they're wrong and they </v>

1474
01:14:10.180 --> 01:14:10.180
<v Speaker 3>still arrest people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They still prosecute people.</v>

1475
01:14:10.180 --> 01:14:12.490
<v Speaker 3>This has been so many instances of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't trust</v>

1476
01:14:12.670 --> 01:14:14.230
<v Speaker 1>their judgment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't trust.</v>

1477
01:14:14.410 --> 01:14:19.410
<v Speaker 1>There was a video the other day of a man</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's a police officer pulling some </v>

1478
01:14:19.410 --> 01:14:23.611
<v Speaker 1>woman she was trying to resist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He threw it to the ground and he's </v>

1479
01:14:23.611 --> 01:14:23.700
<v Speaker 1>beating her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>punching her in the face in,</v>

1480
01:14:23.701 --> 01:14:28.701
<v Speaker 1>in Los Angeles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as long as that is a part of our </v>

1481
01:14:28.701 --> 01:14:28.870
<v Speaker 1>legal system that this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy.</v>

1482
01:14:29.050 --> 01:14:30.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean she wasn't fighting back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't.</v>

1483
01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:33.430
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't fighting for his life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was resisting.</v>

1484
01:14:33.431 --> 01:14:35.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the circumstances </v>
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>

1485
01:14:35.321 --> 01:14:40.321
<v Speaker 1>but whatever I know is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that is the only way you can handle </v>

1486
01:14:40.321 --> 01:14:40.321
<v Speaker 1>that woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't be a police officer.</v>

1487
01:14:40.321 --> 01:14:42.400
<v Speaker 1>And as ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as that exists,</v>

1488
01:14:42.610 --> 01:14:47.610
<v Speaker 1>that's part of our legal system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just a human flaw that exists on </v>

1489
01:14:47.610 --> 01:14:51.931
<v Speaker 1>all levels that will exist as far as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>police officer who's on the street that </v>

1490
01:14:51.931 --> 01:14:54.040
<v Speaker 1>will exist as far as a prosecutor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a judge,</v>

1491
01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:59.440
<v Speaker 1>a person running a prison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's going to be human flaws and the </v>

1492
01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:03.451
<v Speaker 1>entire system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the only reason why I </v>

1493
01:15:03.451 --> 01:15:04.060
<v Speaker 1>hesitate as far as.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in that sense,</v>

1494
01:15:04.061 --> 01:15:09.061
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm way more Republican than I am </v>

1495
01:15:09.061 --> 01:15:09.061
<v Speaker 1>Democrat.</v>

1496
01:15:09.061 --> 01:15:11.250
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I tell you a story about a sort of </v>

1497
01:15:11.250 --> 01:15:11.250
<v Speaker 5>police misconduct,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1498
01:15:11.250 --> 01:15:16.160
<v Speaker 5>many years ago I had met a guy who would</v>
<v Speaker 5>serve as a public defender in the La </v>

1499
01:15:18.971 --> 01:15:21.500
<v Speaker 5>county system.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And as we were chatting,</v>

1500
01:15:21.501 --> 01:15:26.501
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was very interested in all of this </v>

1501
01:15:26.501 --> 01:15:26.501
<v Speaker 5>stuff that he had to say.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He said to me,</v>

1502
01:15:26.501 --> 01:15:29.630
<v Speaker 5>one advice I could give you is don't </v>
<v Speaker 5>ever do anything in California that will</v>

1503
01:15:29.631 --> 01:15:32.170
<v Speaker 5>have you end up in La County jail.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I said,</v>

1504
01:15:32.171 --> 01:15:32.860
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why's that?</v>

1505
01:15:33.370 --> 01:15:35.380
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>give me an example of why would somebody</v>

1506
01:15:35.381 --> 01:15:36.040
<v Speaker 5>like me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>

1507
01:15:36.041 --> 01:15:40.510
<v Speaker 5>let's suppose you were a recidivist </v>
<v Speaker 5>drink and drive kind of guy,</v>

1508
01:15:40.540 --> 01:15:43.720
<v Speaker 5>and the cops are pissed off at you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They'll take you to the jail,</v>

1509
01:15:43.750 --> 01:15:48.750
<v Speaker 5>they'll throw you with all the </v>
<v Speaker 5>gangbangers and they'll simply scream </v>

1510
01:15:48.750 --> 01:15:50.170
<v Speaker 5>out fresh fish out of water.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's exactly the term that he used,</v>

1511
01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:54.910
<v Speaker 5>which basically is the code word for </v>
<v Speaker 5>have that in boys and we won't,</v>

1512
01:15:55.300 --> 01:15:57.990
<v Speaker 5>we won't hurt here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>His screams and,</v>

1513
01:15:58.180 --> 01:15:59.270
<v Speaker 5>and I remember this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

1514
01:15:59.350 --> 01:16:04.350
<v Speaker 5>this isn't in the late eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And subsequently I actually met the son </v>

1515
01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:10.440
<v Speaker 5>of the sky coincidentally and later </v>
<v Speaker 5>found out that that was his father by </v>

1516
01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:10.990
<v Speaker 5>quincy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was an academic also.</v>

1517
01:16:11.470 --> 01:16:12.230
<v Speaker 5>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so that's,</v>

1518
01:16:12.231 --> 01:16:14.380
<v Speaker 5>that's an example of misconduct where,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1519
01:16:14.381 --> 01:16:17.950
<v Speaker 5>if you piss off these gaps,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they could do all sorts of things to you</v>

1520
01:16:17.960 --> 01:16:20.920
<v Speaker 5>that can have some profound consequences</v>
<v Speaker 5>on your body.</v>

1521
01:16:21.010 --> 01:16:22.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to state for the record,</v>

1522
01:16:22.331 --> 01:16:27.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big supporter of law enforcement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Always have been one bad cop is not cops</v>

1523
01:16:27.311 --> 01:16:29.440
<v Speaker 1>make bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make all cops are bad.</v>

1524
01:16:30.940 --> 01:16:32.230
<v Speaker 1>Humans were flawed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1525
01:16:32.231 --> 01:16:35.380
<v Speaker 1>not every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not every doctor is a good person.</v>

1526
01:16:35.410 --> 01:16:37.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend who used to work when he</v>

1527
01:16:37.541 --> 01:16:42.541
<v Speaker 1>was younger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he worked at a resort and he said he </v>

1528
01:16:42.541 --> 01:16:46.291
<v Speaker 1>would overhear these doctors very </v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically remembered overhearing </v>

1529
01:16:46.291 --> 01:16:49.801
<v Speaker 1>these doctors bragging about talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy into a surgery and about how </v>

1530
01:16:49.801 --> 01:16:50.510
<v Speaker 1>he's going to buy a car now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1531
01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:50.890
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1532
01:16:50.940 --> 01:16:53.500
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a new whatever it was,</v>

1533
01:16:53.670 --> 01:16:54.490
<v Speaker 1>porsche,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

1534
01:16:54.491 --> 01:16:55.400
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1535
01:16:55.660 --> 01:17:00.660
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was bragging about talking to </v>

1536
01:17:00.660 --> 01:17:00.660
<v Speaker 1>this kind of surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Incredible.</v>

1537
01:17:00.660 --> 01:17:00.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1538
01:17:00.660 --> 01:17:02.620
<v Speaker 1>that's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That does happen.</v>

1539
01:17:02.900 --> 01:17:05.950
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there there's bad people in all walks of</v>

1540
01:17:05.951 --> 01:17:10.951
<v Speaker 1>life and I think that that is my number,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my only really resistance to something </v>

1541
01:17:11.841 --> 01:17:16.841
<v Speaker 1>like the death penalty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you look at the recidivism </v>

1542
01:17:16.841 --> 01:17:17.390
<v Speaker 1>rates for child rapists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just through the roof.</v>

1543
01:17:17.391 --> 01:17:18.200
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

1544
01:17:18.620 --> 01:17:22.550
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if you've seen the stat I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I can't cite who came up with it,</v>

1545
01:17:22.551 --> 01:17:25.850
<v Speaker 5>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>apparently when you catch a pedophile,</v>

1546
01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:30.880
<v Speaker 5>he's on average committed 100 </v>
<v Speaker 5>transgressions prior to you catching him</v>

1547
01:17:31.311 --> 01:17:32.780
<v Speaker 5>for the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1548
01:17:33.190 --> 01:17:37.610
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so why does this guy benefit from all of</v>

1549
01:17:37.611 --> 01:17:39.010
<v Speaker 5>our legals?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it,</v>

1550
01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:39.590
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

1551
01:17:39.650 --> 01:17:44.650
<v Speaker 5>If you've done this stuff so many times,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why do we have to be humane?</v>

1552
01:17:45.170 --> 01:17:48.890
<v Speaker 5>I would actually argue it's inhumane to </v>
<v Speaker 5>be so human to this guy,</v>

1553
01:17:49.220 --> 01:17:52.310
<v Speaker 5>and I wrote an article on on psychology </v>
<v Speaker 5>today where I was talking about,</v>

1554
01:17:52.610 --> 01:17:57.290
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if you remember the case </v>
<v Speaker 5>with the two guys in Connecticut who did</v>

1555
01:17:57.291 --> 01:18:02.291
<v Speaker 5>a home invasion and they raped the girls</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the mother and set the house on </v>

1556
01:18:03.171 --> 01:18:04.520
<v Speaker 5>fire,</v>
<v Speaker 5>beat the father,</v>

1557
01:18:04.521 --> 01:18:09.521
<v Speaker 5>but he survived and so on and so it was </v>
<v Speaker 5>coming up to their death penalty and so </v>

1558
01:18:09.521 --> 01:18:11.670
<v Speaker 5>I sort of as a tribute to that case,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wrote a,</v>

1559
01:18:12.030 --> 01:18:17.030
<v Speaker 5>an article on my psychology today blog,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which I think I titled is the Death </v>

1560
01:18:17.030 --> 01:18:18.650
<v Speaker 5>Penalty Barbaric and I was arguing that </v>
<v Speaker 5>in for these kinds of guys.</v>

1561
01:18:18.651 --> 01:18:19.250
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not.</v>

1562
01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:24.760
<v Speaker 5>While you should have seen my </v>
<v Speaker 5>progressive enlightened cafe sipping </v>

1563
01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:28.220
<v Speaker 5>academic colleagues scoff at my barber </v>
<v Speaker 5>isn't right.</v>

1564
01:18:28.730 --> 01:18:32.330
<v Speaker 5>What kind of Hick must it be to actually</v>
<v Speaker 5>even hold those sentences?</v>

1565
01:18:32.350 --> 01:18:33.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got news for you,</v>

1566
01:18:33.431 --> 01:18:34.450
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it comes between,</v>

1567
01:18:34.451 --> 01:18:39.451
<v Speaker 1>put me in jail for the rest of my life </v>
<v Speaker 1>and some cage where I have to be </v>

1568
01:18:39.451 --> 01:18:40.920
<v Speaker 1>constantly in fear of men raping me and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stabbing me with tooth parses,</v>

1569
01:18:41.380 --> 01:18:46.380
<v Speaker 1>sharp knives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll take death exactly that way and I </v>

1570
01:18:46.380 --> 01:18:46.380
<v Speaker 1>think we should all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's no,</v>

1571
01:18:46.380 --> 01:18:48.700
<v Speaker 1>no possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable hope for parole.</v>

1572
01:18:48.850 --> 01:18:52.150
<v Speaker 1>The idea of keeping someone to jail and </v>
<v Speaker 1>a jail to rot for the rest of their life</v>

1573
01:18:52.300 --> 01:18:54.100
<v Speaker 1>is probably more subtle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More cruel.</v>

1574
01:18:54.101 --> 01:18:54.790
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1575
01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.330
<v Speaker 1>It's just bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that that's,</v>

1576
01:18:57.350 --> 01:19:02.200
<v Speaker 1>that's somehow or another humane is so </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy and a lot of them,</v>

1577
01:19:02.201 --> 01:19:04.060
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>solitary confinement,</v>

1578
01:19:04.210 --> 01:19:07.210
<v Speaker 1>which is probably one of the worst </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that you could do to a person,</v>

1579
01:19:07.370 --> 01:19:10.580
<v Speaker 1>especially a social,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a social analyst person.</v>

1580
01:19:10.750 --> 01:19:15.750
<v Speaker 1>People were weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need to be connected so much and one </v>

1581
01:19:15.750 --> 01:19:19.321
<v Speaker 1>of the worst punishments you could do it</v>
<v Speaker 1>just leave us alone while we're in </v>

1582
01:19:19.321 --> 01:19:20.260
<v Speaker 1>prison,</v>
<v Speaker 1>surrounded by murderers,</v>

1583
01:19:20.261 --> 01:19:21.460
<v Speaker 1>rapists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thieves,</v>

1584
01:19:21.461 --> 01:19:23.260
<v Speaker 1>thugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drug dealers.</v>

1585
01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:26.050
<v Speaker 1>The worst thing they can do is put you </v>
<v Speaker 1>by yourself.</v>

1586
01:19:26.230 --> 01:19:28.540
<v Speaker 5>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Amazed that there's a guy,</v>

1587
01:19:28.541 --> 01:19:30.250
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember his name,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a Harvard,</v>

1588
01:19:30.270 --> 01:19:33.070
<v Speaker 5>a professor who had studied,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1589
01:19:33.290 --> 01:19:35.570
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what makes people healthy for,</v>

1590
01:19:35.590 --> 01:19:38.740
<v Speaker 5>for something like 60 years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think the bottom line,</v>

1591
01:19:38.980 --> 01:19:43.510
<v Speaker 5>if I'm paraphrasing him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that people need social relationships</v>

1592
01:19:43.660 --> 01:19:46.660
<v Speaker 5>to be healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's sort of the number one thing that</v>

1593
01:19:46.870 --> 01:19:49.720
<v Speaker 5>maintains your health,</v>
<v Speaker 5>psychological and physiological</v>

1594
01:19:50.170 --> 01:19:52.340
<v Speaker 1>and happy social relationships to </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1595
01:19:52.350 --> 01:19:52.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1596
01:19:52.860 --> 01:19:57.860
<v Speaker 1>everyone that I know that has these </v>
<v Speaker 1>horrible relationships with either </v>

1597
01:19:57.860 --> 01:20:01.780
<v Speaker 1>boyfriends and girlfriends or with their</v>
<v Speaker 1>parents or with their job or the like,</v>

1598
01:20:01.830 --> 01:20:04.620
<v Speaker 1>they seem to like carry those on like </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>

1599
01:20:04.621 --> 01:20:06.930
<v Speaker 1>It's like becomes almost a part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>norm of.</v>

1600
01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:08.070
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

1601
01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:13.070
<v Speaker 3>the people that I know that have healthy</v>
<v Speaker 3>relationships with their boyfriends and </v>

1602
01:20:13.070 --> 01:20:16.851
<v Speaker 3>girlfriends or wives and husbands,</v>
<v Speaker 3>healthy relationships with their </v>

1603
01:20:16.851 --> 01:20:19.551
<v Speaker 3>children,</v>
<v Speaker 3>healthy relationships with their </v>

1604
01:20:19.551 --> 01:20:19.551
<v Speaker 3>friends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are the happiest people I know,</v>

1605
01:20:19.551 --> 01:20:19.551
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you can't,</v>

1606
01:20:19.551 --> 01:20:24.171
<v Speaker 3>you could foster that and you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>somehow or another j generate this sort </v>

1607
01:20:24.171 --> 01:20:27.300
<v Speaker 3>of beautiful environment around the </v>
<v Speaker 3>closest people to you.</v>

1608
01:20:27.470 --> 01:20:29.490
<v Speaker 3>You'll have a much better life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just that simple.</v>

1609
01:20:29.670 --> 01:20:34.670
<v Speaker 3>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>evolutionary psychologists study all of </v>

1610
01:20:34.670 --> 01:20:34.670
<v Speaker 3>these kinds of things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1611
01:20:34.670 --> 01:20:38.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why is it that we would jump into a </v>

1612
01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:38.360
<v Speaker 3>river to save two brothers or better </v>
<v Speaker 3>yet,</v>

1613
01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:40.170
<v Speaker 3>why would we jump into a river to save a</v>
<v Speaker 3>stranger?</v>

1614
01:20:40.710 --> 01:20:41.240
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it,</v>

1615
01:20:41.350 --> 01:20:46.350
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it boils down to the fact that it's tit </v>

1616
01:20:46.350 --> 01:20:46.350
<v Speaker 3>for tat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1617
01:20:46.350 --> 01:20:47.880
<v Speaker 3>It's what's called reciprocal altruism </v>
<v Speaker 3>a.</v>

1618
01:20:48.060 --> 01:20:50.040
<v Speaker 3>are you familiar with this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1619
01:20:50.390 --> 01:20:52.300
<v Speaker 3>so someone will do that for you someday.</v>

1620
01:20:52.460 --> 01:20:53.360
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1621
01:20:53.530 --> 01:20:56.400
<v Speaker 3>And so the idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1622
01:20:56.460 --> 01:21:01.460
<v Speaker 3>as you said that it's a real punishment </v>
<v Speaker 3>that put people in confinement is borne </v>

1623
01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:06.560
<v Speaker 3>out by evolutionary theory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My friend Rammi jumped into a river to </v>

1624
01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:06.560
<v Speaker 3>save a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She,</v>

1625
01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:07.740
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was in a canoe canoe,</v>

1626
01:21:07.741 --> 01:21:09.420
<v Speaker 3>flipped over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>husband drowned.</v>

1627
01:21:09.421 --> 01:21:13.590
<v Speaker 3>The husband's body floated face first </v>
<v Speaker 3>passed him and the woman was screaming,</v>

1628
01:21:13.591 --> 01:21:18.591
<v Speaker 3>help me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he saw he saw her in the river and </v>

1629
01:21:18.591 --> 01:21:22.041
<v Speaker 3>he just dove in and he's lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's in incredible shape and he's an </v>

1630
01:21:22.041 --> 01:21:23.490
<v Speaker 3>outdoorsman and he's there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a very good athlete,</v>

1631
01:21:23.491 --> 01:21:25.530
<v Speaker 3>very good sweater.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got real good endurance.</v>

1632
01:21:25.531 --> 01:21:29.850
<v Speaker 3>So he got to death's door,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like literally on death's door,</v>

1633
01:21:29.910 --> 01:21:31.190
<v Speaker 3>thought it was over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thought it,</v>

1634
01:21:31.230 --> 01:21:36.230
<v Speaker 3>he's not going to make it out of here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he just sacrificed his life trying </v>

1635
01:21:36.230 --> 01:21:37.950
<v Speaker 3>to save this woman and then rescued,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or they figured out a way to shore.</v>

1636
01:21:37.950 --> 01:21:41.280
<v Speaker 3>But when he describes the feeling and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the experience,</v>

1637
01:21:41.750 --> 01:21:45.180
<v Speaker 3>it was almost beyond his control.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like he saw this woman.</v>

1638
01:21:45.370 --> 01:21:47.310
<v Speaker 3>It was only him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was no one else there.</v>

1639
01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:51.300
<v Speaker 3>He had to do it and just jumped in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>While there's this thing,</v>

1640
01:21:51.690 --> 01:21:54.570
<v Speaker 3>speaking of guys who are in the business</v>
<v Speaker 3>of doing heroic acts,</v>

1641
01:21:54.571 --> 01:21:57.030
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've heard of the fireman fantasy.</v>

1642
01:21:57.031 --> 01:22:02.031
<v Speaker 3>I mean that the fact that women find </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys bought firemen to be very </v>

1643
01:22:02.031 --> 01:22:06.771
<v Speaker 3>attractive and it actually turns out </v>
<v Speaker 3>that there was a study that was done </v>

1644
01:22:06.771 --> 01:22:10.400
<v Speaker 3>that actually shows us to be the case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I have discussed this in one of my </v>

1645
01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:13.011
<v Speaker 3>articles on psychology today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you have a guy approach women either </v>

1646
01:22:13.011 --> 01:22:14.160
<v Speaker 3>wearing a fireman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sooth or not,</v>

1647
01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:19.680
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his chances of getting her phone number </v>

1648
01:22:19.680 --> 01:22:21.150
<v Speaker 3>increases quite substantially.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really if he is wearing a fireman.</v>

1649
01:22:21.151 --> 01:22:22.470
<v Speaker 3>So how do they know this?</v>

1650
01:22:22.650 --> 01:22:27.650
<v Speaker 3>Did they do a study guide?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where do they have the same guy?</v>

1651
01:22:28.020 --> 01:22:31.380
<v Speaker 3>Not where the firemen with the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>approach and the same.</v>

1652
01:22:31.410 --> 01:22:32.780
<v Speaker 3>Same word,</v>
<v Speaker 3>same scripts,</v>

1653
01:22:32.781 --> 01:22:34.410
<v Speaker 3>same everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One version.</v>

1654
01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:36.910
<v Speaker 3>It's called the field experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In one version you,</v>

1655
01:22:36.940 --> 01:22:40.310
<v Speaker 3>you approach women at a cafe wearing the</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff and another version you don't.</v>

1656
01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:44.040
<v Speaker 3>The Guy who actually did that research </v>
<v Speaker 3>is a French psychologist.</v>

1657
01:22:44.041 --> 01:22:49.041
<v Speaker 3>His name is Nicola Guy and I've actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>covered a few of his studies on my </v>

1658
01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:54.680
<v Speaker 3>website,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my most read article ever over maybe </v>

1659
01:22:54.680 --> 01:22:55.710
<v Speaker 3>three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>400,000</v>

1660
01:22:55.711 --> 01:23:00.711
<v Speaker 3>readers as is one of his studies where I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was sympathetic because we're going to </v>

1661
01:23:00.751 --> 01:23:03.060
<v Speaker 3>talk about the blowback issue now here </v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

1662
01:23:03.480 --> 01:23:06.040
<v Speaker 3>it was a study where he looked at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>likelihood</v>

1663
01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:11.070
<v Speaker 5>of women being picked up as hitchhikers </v>
<v Speaker 5>as a function of their breast size.</v>

1664
01:23:12.430 --> 01:23:17.430
<v Speaker 5>So he actually had the same woman and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they artificially manipulated her breast</v>

1665
01:23:18.191 --> 01:23:21.220
<v Speaker 5>size and on different days she would </v>
<v Speaker 5>stand there.</v>

1666
01:23:21.221 --> 01:23:26.221
<v Speaker 5>And and of course it turned out that men</v>
<v Speaker 5>were much more likely to pick up the </v>

1667
01:23:26.221 --> 01:23:28.120
<v Speaker 5>woman if she had the same woman that she</v>
<v Speaker 5>had bigger breast side.</v>

1668
01:23:28.390 --> 01:23:31.300
<v Speaker 5>So I just summarize that study,</v>
<v Speaker 5>put it up,</v>

1669
01:23:31.390 --> 01:23:33.190
<v Speaker 5>and then I remember I had gone on </v>
<v Speaker 5>vacation,</v>

1670
01:23:33.850 --> 01:23:36.700
<v Speaker 5>came back from vacation father that I </v>
<v Speaker 5>had to completely gone viral,</v>

1671
01:23:37.030 --> 01:23:41.410
<v Speaker 5>but I had a million hate mail,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not just from readers,</v>

1672
01:23:41.710 --> 01:23:46.710
<v Speaker 5>but from fellow psychologists that they </v>
<v Speaker 5>bloggers who were arguing that I was </v>

1673
01:23:47.140 --> 01:23:52.140
<v Speaker 5>peddling pornography because I had a </v>
<v Speaker 5>picture as the teaser image for that </v>

1674
01:23:52.140 --> 01:23:56.071
<v Speaker 5>article.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had a photo of a woman sitting in a </v>

1675
01:23:56.071 --> 01:23:56.071
<v Speaker 5>passenger seat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>would big wood,</v>

1676
01:23:56.071 --> 01:23:56.830
<v Speaker 5>large breasts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1677
01:23:56.831 --> 01:24:01.831
<v Speaker 5>it seemed appropriate for the topic </v>
<v Speaker 5>given that that's what the topic of the </v>

1678
01:24:01.831 --> 01:24:05.011
<v Speaker 5>study was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But by putting that image I was </v>

1679
01:24:05.011 --> 01:24:06.820
<v Speaker 5>objectifying women.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was treating them as sex objects.</v>

1680
01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:12.000
<v Speaker 5>And so even though I had nothing to do </v>
<v Speaker 5>with the study and I was simply </v>

1681
01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.791
<v Speaker 5>summarizing somebody else's work,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was a horrifying pornographic </v>

1682
01:24:15.010 --> 01:24:15.370
<v Speaker 5>pedaling.</v>

1683
01:24:15.470 --> 01:24:19.070
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it funny that just a photograph of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a woman with large breasts is considered</v>

1684
01:24:19.071 --> 01:24:19.790
<v Speaker 1>pornographic</v>

1685
01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:20.480
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>

1686
01:24:20.481 --> 01:24:25.481
<v Speaker 5>listen to this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So then I've also written articles on </v>

1687
01:24:25.481 --> 01:24:26.690
<v Speaker 5>psychology today where I talk about all </v>
<v Speaker 5>kinds of issues dealing with penis size.</v>

1688
01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:32.000
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so do women want a guy with a bigger </v>

1689
01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:32.000
<v Speaker 5>penis?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Are they more likely to have orgasms?</v>

1690
01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:32.280
<v Speaker 5>She's got a bigger penis.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1691
01:24:32.780 --> 01:24:35.310
<v Speaker 5>if you're in a gay relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

1692
01:24:35.340 --> 01:24:40.340
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are you likely to be top or bottom as a </v>

1693
01:24:40.340 --> 01:24:42.770
<v Speaker 5>function of your penis size?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That study has been done by science,</v>

1694
01:24:43.100 --> 01:24:47.930
<v Speaker 5>and so for those articles I put sexy </v>
<v Speaker 5>images of men.</v>

1695
01:24:48.470 --> 01:24:52.730
<v Speaker 5>So then I wrote to each of those people </v>
<v Speaker 5>who had written the hate man.</v>

1696
01:24:52.731 --> 01:24:53.570
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1697
01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:57.650
<v Speaker 5>in all fairness,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you now have to write an equally hateful</v>

1698
01:24:57.651 --> 01:25:01.370
<v Speaker 5>thing because I'm also sexually </v>
<v Speaker 5>exploiting men's bodies.</v>

1699
01:25:01.610 --> 01:25:03.500
<v Speaker 5>Of course they went away and never came </v>
<v Speaker 5>back.</v>

1700
01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:05.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1701
01:25:05.561 --> 01:25:10.150
<v Speaker 1>the idea being that women are more </v>
<v Speaker 1>oppressed than men are not equal,</v>

1702
01:25:10.151 --> 01:25:13.360
<v Speaker 1>but it is equal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very tricky,</v>

1703
01:25:13.361 --> 01:25:18.361
<v Speaker 1>but the idea that a woman with big </v>
<v Speaker 1>breasts sitting there and I passed her </v>

1704
01:25:18.361 --> 01:25:21.271
<v Speaker 1>seat of a car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could somehow or another be </v>

1705
01:25:21.271 --> 01:25:21.271
<v Speaker 1>pornographic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was ridiculous.</v>

1706
01:25:21.271 --> 01:25:21.271
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Women have big breasts,</v>

1707
01:25:21.271 --> 01:25:23.320
<v Speaker 1>so some of them they exists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in a big penises.</v>

1708
01:25:23.590 --> 01:25:25.150
<v Speaker 1>It all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all real stuff.</v>

1709
01:25:25.390 --> 01:25:28.840
<v Speaker 1>Some people have two eyes and noses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interestingly,</v>

1710
01:25:28.841 --> 01:25:29.320
<v Speaker 1>some of the</v>

1711
01:25:29.550 --> 01:25:31.970
<v Speaker 5>college,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these are psychologists were saying,</v>

1712
01:25:32.270 --> 01:25:34.790
<v Speaker 5>why do you write about these issues of </v>
<v Speaker 5>sexuality?</v>

1713
01:25:34.791 --> 01:25:36.740
<v Speaker 5>What does that have to do with </v>
<v Speaker 5>psychology?</v>

1714
01:25:36.860 --> 01:25:41.860
<v Speaker 5>Why are you so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so that psychologists could actually </v>

1715
01:25:41.860 --> 01:25:45.971
<v Speaker 5>argue that issues dealing with sexuality</v>
<v Speaker 5>were outside the purview of psychology.</v>

1716
01:25:46.910 --> 01:25:47.150
<v Speaker 5>That's.</v>

1717
01:25:47.880 --> 01:25:48.870
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's stupid.</v>

1718
01:25:48.990 --> 01:25:53.990
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's scary stupid because it's denying </v>

1719
01:25:53.990 --> 01:25:55.950
<v Speaker 1>reality in order to fit with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideology.</v>

1720
01:25:56.160 --> 01:25:58.830
<v Speaker 1>This ideology of politically correct </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>

1721
01:25:58.831 --> 01:26:01.170
<v Speaker 1>And I don't like the term politically </v>
<v Speaker 1>correct.</v>

1722
01:26:01.530 --> 01:26:04.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't like it because it's been sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of overrun</v>

1723
01:26:04.610 --> 01:26:07.580
<v Speaker 3>and overused and it's kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a beaten term,</v>

1724
01:26:07.610 --> 01:26:08.360
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1725
01:26:08.361 --> 01:26:11.990
<v Speaker 3>but it's the appropriate one just to </v>
<v Speaker 3>convey the idea.</v>

1726
01:26:12.030 --> 01:26:14.470
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's just,</v>

1727
01:26:14.510 --> 01:26:17.570
<v Speaker 3>it's so prevalent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so prevalent and that the fact that</v>

1728
01:26:17.571 --> 01:26:20.960
<v Speaker 3>it's so prevalent amongst academics is </v>
<v Speaker 3>really disturbing to me.</v>

1729
01:26:21.170 --> 01:26:22.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm with you,</v>

1730
01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:23.690
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have you had,</v>

1731
01:26:23.720 --> 01:26:26.670
<v Speaker 3>have you had many other academics on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>show quite a bit.</v>

1732
01:26:27.380 --> 01:26:32.380
<v Speaker 3>What's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how are they like in terms of their </v>

1733
01:26:32.380 --> 01:26:32.380
<v Speaker 3>general positions?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1734
01:26:32.380 --> 01:26:32.380
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many,</v>

1735
01:26:32.380 --> 01:26:34.460
<v Speaker 3>many of them share your points of view.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>

1736
01:26:34.720 --> 01:26:39.720
<v Speaker 3>Luckily.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now is it just that you happen to </v>

1737
01:26:39.720 --> 01:26:42.790
<v Speaker 3>gravitate towards guys that you would </v>
<v Speaker 3>think that already would sort of not be </v>

1738
01:26:42.790 --> 01:26:43.490
<v Speaker 3>these little wimpy guys or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or.</v>

1739
01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:48.800
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how come it turns out that they're all </v>

1740
01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:48.800
<v Speaker 3>sharing because we're certainly in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>minority in academia,</v>

1741
01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:50.270
<v Speaker 3>so those are the only ones I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>interested in.</v>

1742
01:26:50.900 --> 01:26:51.660
<v Speaker 3>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1743
01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:56.680
<v Speaker 3>I'm actually quite fascinating talk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would love to talk to some male </v>

1744
01:26:56.680 --> 01:26:59.870
<v Speaker 3>feminist who shares these Islamic phobic</v>
<v Speaker 3>hating ideas,</v>

1745
01:26:59.871 --> 01:27:02.960
<v Speaker 3>like hating Islamophobia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'll send you,</v>

1746
01:27:02.961 --> 01:27:06.200
<v Speaker 3>I'll send you some names.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the problem is,</v>

1747
01:27:06.201 --> 01:27:11.201
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would get ugly somewhere along the </v>

1748
01:27:11.201 --> 01:27:11.201
<v Speaker 3>line,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1749
01:27:11.201 --> 01:27:13.810
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure one of us would resort to </v>

1750
01:27:13.810 --> 01:27:13.810
<v Speaker 3>insults not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't be.</v>

1751
01:27:13.940 --> 01:27:17.690
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't put.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am utterly fascinated by ideology,</v>

1752
01:27:18.470 --> 01:27:21.020
<v Speaker 3>ideologies that I support or do not </v>
<v Speaker 3>support,</v>

1753
01:27:21.290 --> 01:27:22.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of them.</v>

1754
01:27:22.071 --> 01:27:22.910
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1755
01:27:22.911 --> 01:27:23.240
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1756
01:27:23.241 --> 01:27:27.140
<v Speaker 3>I'm fascinated by the Dalai Lama.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm fascinated by how many people take a</v>

1757
01:27:27.141 --> 01:27:29.120
<v Speaker 3>guy who only wears orange robe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seriously.</v>

1758
01:27:29.690 --> 01:27:34.690
<v Speaker 3>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you really think God gives a fuck </v>

1759
01:27:34.690 --> 01:27:34.690
<v Speaker 3>what clothes you wear?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is He,</v>

1760
01:27:34.690 --> 01:27:37.220
<v Speaker 3>is he staying warm in that or is he.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's no different than that fucking Phil</v>

1761
01:27:37.220 --> 01:27:38.560
<v Speaker 3>Robertson Guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's from duck dynasty.</v>

1762
01:27:38.580 --> 01:27:43.580
<v Speaker 3>Always worse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cammo was wearing a God damn outfit and </v>

1763
01:27:43.580 --> 01:27:43.580
<v Speaker 3>buy that outfit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You recognize that he,</v>

1764
01:27:43.580 --> 01:27:48.341
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a man of peace and of enlightened </v>

1765
01:27:48.341 --> 01:27:48.341
<v Speaker 3>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1766
01:27:48.341 --> 01:27:49.550
<v Speaker 3>he's a silly man who wears orange,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't have sex.</v>

1767
01:27:49.670 --> 01:27:51.470
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And why does he not have sex?</v>

1768
01:27:51.471 --> 01:27:53.450
<v Speaker 3>Because he has an ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1769
01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:57.200
<v Speaker 3>This ideology tells him that he's a holy</v>
<v Speaker 3>man from birth.</v>

1770
01:27:57.580 --> 01:28:02.580
<v Speaker 3>And if you don't think that's fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous because he's friends with </v>

1771
01:28:02.580 --> 01:28:02.580
<v Speaker 3>Sharon stone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You and I have nothing to talk about.</v>

1772
01:28:02.890 --> 01:28:03.310
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

1773
01:28:03.420 --> 01:28:05.590
<v Speaker 3>he's buddies with Richard Gere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He must be holy.</v>

1774
01:28:05.870 --> 01:28:07.320
<v Speaker 3>You get the fuck Outta here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1775
01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:12.400
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's funny you talk about these </v>

1776
01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:13.991
<v Speaker 3>Hollywood types.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wrote an article which one of those </v>

1777
01:28:13.991 --> 01:28:17.291
<v Speaker 3>really popular ones on psychology today </v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was talking about the narcissism </v>

1778
01:28:17.291 --> 01:28:19.980
<v Speaker 3>and grandiosity of celebrities were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1779
01:28:20.300 --> 01:28:21.000
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1780
01:28:21.230 --> 01:28:24.950
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's her madonna because of her cabala</v>

1781
01:28:24.951 --> 01:28:26.180
<v Speaker 3>juice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1782
01:28:26.210 --> 01:28:27.570
<v Speaker 3>says that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1783
01:28:27.590 --> 01:28:32.590
<v Speaker 3>the radiation problem and some lake in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Ukraine could be resolved by putting </v>

1784
01:28:32.590 --> 01:28:34.020
<v Speaker 3>some cabala juice on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she's really,</v>

1785
01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:36.500
<v Speaker 3>she's really astounding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come on,</v>

1786
01:28:36.510 --> 01:28:40.180
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kabbalah Kabbalah.</v>

1787
01:28:40.190 --> 01:28:41.560
<v Speaker 3>Holy Water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know anyone.</v>

1788
01:28:41.620 --> 01:28:44.390
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to help her in any way by </v>
<v Speaker 3>bringing this up.</v>

1789
01:28:44.430 --> 01:28:44.730
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1790
01:28:45.090 --> 01:28:48.020
<v Speaker 3>when Paul had some other thing about </v>
<v Speaker 3>beauty,</v>

1791
01:28:48.290 --> 01:28:49.450
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1792
01:28:49.470 --> 01:28:50.210
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1793
01:28:50.660 --> 01:28:51.070
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1794
01:28:51.220 --> 01:28:52.600
<v Speaker 3>the autism girl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

1795
01:28:53.210 --> 01:28:53.900
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jenny McCarthy,</v>

1796
01:28:53.901 --> 01:28:57.090
<v Speaker 3>Jenny McCarthy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the autism was,</v>

1797
01:28:57.500 --> 01:29:02.010
<v Speaker 3>was shocked that the NIH,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Institute of Health was</v>

1798
01:29:02.010 --> 01:29:06.420
<v Speaker 5>not taking her scientific research </v>
<v Speaker 5>seriously demonstrating that that's what</v>

1799
01:29:06.910 --> 01:29:09.590
<v Speaker 5>she has.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Scientists know she does research.</v>

1800
01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:14.720
<v Speaker 5>She,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think she must've played once at some </v>

1801
01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:14.720
<v Speaker 5>point.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1802
01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:14.970
<v Speaker 5>but seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what I argue there is that,</v>

1803
01:29:15.710 --> 01:29:16.780
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1804
01:29:16.860 --> 01:29:21.860
<v Speaker 5>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're walking all day with yes men </v>

1805
01:29:21.860 --> 01:29:26.600
<v Speaker 5>catering to each of your whims,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you actually live in a world where you </v>

1806
01:29:26.600 --> 01:29:27.570
<v Speaker 5>truly start thinking that you're data.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1807
01:29:27.571 --> 01:29:32.571
<v Speaker 5>you really did save the world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm Tom Cruise and I saved the world in </v>

1808
01:29:32.571 --> 01:29:32.571
<v Speaker 5>mission impossible,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever,</v>

1809
01:29:32.571 --> 01:29:37.010
<v Speaker 5>and therefore it is perfectly reasonable</v>
<v Speaker 5>that I have something profound to say </v>

1810
01:29:37.010 --> 01:29:41.661
<v Speaker 5>about everything right there for Tom </v>
<v Speaker 5>Cruise says that there is no such thing </v>

1811
01:29:41.661 --> 01:29:44.010
<v Speaker 5>as psych,</v>
<v Speaker 5>psychiatric instant illnesses.</v>

1812
01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:49.160
<v Speaker 5>You just have to do exercise and </v>
<v Speaker 5>vitamins and that we don't take that </v>

1813
01:29:49.160 --> 01:29:52.911
<v Speaker 5>seriously is really an affront to him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so I had written an article where I </v>

1814
01:29:52.911 --> 01:29:57.111
<v Speaker 5>was saying that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's really astounding the type of </v>

1815
01:29:57.111 --> 01:29:58.830
<v Speaker 5>narcissism that these folks and I argued</v>
<v Speaker 5>that it is part,</v>

1816
01:29:58.860 --> 01:30:03.860
<v Speaker 5>it comes from a form of guilt that deep </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the recesses of their bedrooms,</v>

1817
01:30:04.741 --> 01:30:08.250
<v Speaker 5>when they turn off the lights,</v>
<v Speaker 5>many of them actually know that they are</v>

1818
01:30:08.251 --> 01:30:12.360
<v Speaker 5>frauds that are not really deserving of </v>
<v Speaker 5>all of the perks that they've received.</v>

1819
01:30:12.660 --> 01:30:17.660
<v Speaker 5>And so one of the ways that maybe I </v>
<v Speaker 5>could fix that is by demonstrating that </v>

1820
01:30:17.660 --> 01:30:20.370
<v Speaker 5>I am much more than a mere actor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm really helping in Darfur.</v>

1821
01:30:20.371 --> 01:30:25.371
<v Speaker 5>I'm really helping solve the radiation </v>
<v Speaker 5>problem in the Ukraine and so on and so </v>

1822
01:30:25.371 --> 01:30:28.020
<v Speaker 5>forth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because then I seem as though maybe I am</v>

1823
01:30:28.021 --> 01:30:31.020
<v Speaker 5>more worthy of all the accolades that </v>
<v Speaker 5>are being bestowed upon me.</v>

1824
01:30:31.300 --> 01:30:33.500
<v Speaker 1>That's a very fascinating way of looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>at it.</v>

1825
01:30:33.530 --> 01:30:35.440
<v Speaker 1>I think you probably are onto something </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1826
01:30:35.650 --> 01:30:40.120
<v Speaker 1>I think the knowledge and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding that they're frauds,</v>

1827
01:30:40.900 --> 01:30:45.900
<v Speaker 1>the deep seated knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether they avoid it and deny it or </v>

1828
01:30:45.900 --> 01:30:49.441
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I there's a lot of people that are </v>

1829
01:30:49.441 --> 01:30:52.051
<v Speaker 1>horrible people that are involved in </v>
<v Speaker 1>charitable organizations and one of the </v>

1830
01:30:52.051 --> 01:30:54.970
<v Speaker 1>reasons being is to church sort of show </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they are good people.</v>

1831
01:30:55.420 --> 01:31:00.420
<v Speaker 1>There's a guy who's a pretty blatant </v>
<v Speaker 1>plagiarist who's involved in some pretty</v>

1832
01:31:01.990 --> 01:31:04.060
<v Speaker 1>interesting charities for good </v>
<v Speaker 1>charities,</v>

1833
01:31:04.120 --> 01:31:09.120
<v Speaker 1>very good charities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I had a conversation with someone </v>

1834
01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:09.340
<v Speaker 1>about it and they were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1835
01:31:09.341 --> 01:31:14.341
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He does so much good for this </v>

1836
01:31:14.341 --> 01:31:14.341
<v Speaker 1>organization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

1837
01:31:14.341 --> 01:31:14.341
<v Speaker 1>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1838
01:31:14.341 --> 01:31:16.000
<v Speaker 1>do you understand that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's probably why he does that.</v>

1839
01:31:16.220 --> 01:31:19.990
<v Speaker 1>Like the guy's a complete sociopath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's fucked over his friends.</v>

1840
01:31:19.991 --> 01:31:23.530
<v Speaker 1>You stolen their work and pass it off as</v>
<v Speaker 1>his own.</v>

1841
01:31:23.700 --> 01:31:27.100
<v Speaker 1>Yet he supports firefighters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you not understand that that's what's</v>

1842
01:31:27.101 --> 01:31:27.970
<v Speaker 1>going on there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1843
01:31:27.971 --> 01:31:32.971
<v Speaker 1>he's pretty obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you listen to him talk for any long </v>

1844
01:31:32.971 --> 01:31:32.971
<v Speaker 1>period of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something wrong.</v>

1845
01:31:32.971 --> 01:31:37.950
<v Speaker 1>There's like some some connections </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside the mind that are not being made </v>

1846
01:31:37.950 --> 01:31:40.240
<v Speaker 1>and he's had a strategy and a strategy </v>
<v Speaker 1>to avoid criticism is to show charitable</v>

1847
01:31:40.241 --> 01:31:41.830
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Lance Armstrong,</v>

1848
01:31:41.980 --> 01:31:44.230
<v Speaker 1>whenever he was confronted about his </v>
<v Speaker 1>drug use,</v>

1849
01:31:44.231 --> 01:31:46.360
<v Speaker 1>would always talk about how much he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing for cancer,</v>

1850
01:31:46.630 --> 01:31:48.820
<v Speaker 1>for cancer research.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was this whole thing,</v>

1851
01:31:48.940 --> 01:31:52.690
<v Speaker 1>despite the fact that he'd sued people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that had claimed that they,</v>

1852
01:31:52.930 --> 01:31:55.810
<v Speaker 1>their lives had been affected by his </v>
<v Speaker 1>drug use,</v>

1853
01:31:56.050 --> 01:32:00.190
<v Speaker 1>that they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people that they love had been</v>

1854
01:32:00.460 --> 01:32:02.530
<v Speaker 3>drug tested and that they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1855
01:32:02.531 --> 01:32:07.531
<v Speaker 3>they lost their whole entire career and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they were aligned with Lance </v>

1856
01:32:07.531 --> 01:32:08.230
<v Speaker 3>Armstrong did drugs with Lance </v>
<v Speaker 3>Armstrong,</v>

1857
01:32:08.440 --> 01:32:10.690
<v Speaker 3>Lance Armstrong would sue these people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1858
01:32:10.691 --> 01:32:15.691
<v Speaker 3>you're in La.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then finally came out and told the </v>

1859
01:32:15.691 --> 01:32:17.581
<v Speaker 3>truth and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>passed off as organization to other </v>

1860
01:32:17.581 --> 01:32:20.761
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now he's a fucking broken man and </v>

1861
01:32:20.761 --> 01:32:20.770
<v Speaker 3>rightly so because he's a God damn </v>
<v Speaker 3>sociopath.</v>

1862
01:32:21.130 --> 01:32:26.130
<v Speaker 3>But that this instance or this </v>
<v Speaker 3>insistence rather of being a part of a </v>

1863
01:32:26.130 --> 01:32:27.790
<v Speaker 3>charitable organization and being the </v>
<v Speaker 3>figurehead,</v>

1864
01:32:28.080 --> 01:32:30.350
<v Speaker 3>not just silently like I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1865
01:32:30.360 --> 01:32:34.960
<v Speaker 3>I'm a big fan of not talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>charities that I contribute to.</v>

1866
01:32:34.961 --> 01:32:37.570
<v Speaker 3>I don't like to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I think there's something sneaky</v>

1867
01:32:37.810 --> 01:32:39.480
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like it,</v>

1868
01:32:40.390 --> 01:32:42.190
<v Speaker 3>like if you give a thousand dollars to a</v>
<v Speaker 3>charity,</v>

1869
01:32:42.191 --> 01:32:43.660
<v Speaker 3>but then you let everybody know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1870
01:32:43.661 --> 01:32:45.460
<v Speaker 3>I just get a thousand dollars to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>charity.</v>

1871
01:32:45.490 --> 01:32:46.780
<v Speaker 3>I talk about that in my books.</v>

1872
01:32:46.940 --> 01:32:48.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's something there.</v>

1873
01:32:49.090 --> 01:32:51.340
<v Speaker 3>You know what my money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is an old philosophy,</v>

1874
01:32:51.370 --> 01:32:53.180
<v Speaker 3>Jewish philosopher from the twelfth </v>
<v Speaker 3>century.</v>

1875
01:32:53.181 --> 01:32:58.181
<v Speaker 3>He's very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very important guy in Jewish moral </v>

1876
01:32:58.181 --> 01:33:00.781
<v Speaker 3>philosophy at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He talked about eight levels of said </v>

1877
01:33:00.781 --> 01:33:03.000
<v Speaker 3>that cuts is charity giving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1878
01:33:03.220 --> 01:33:08.220
<v Speaker 3>in terms of the purity of the act,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the most pure form of Tzedakah is where </v>

1879
01:33:08.501 --> 01:33:13.501
<v Speaker 3>the altruist and the recipient of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>altruism don't know of one another </v>

1880
01:33:13.720 --> 01:33:18.720
<v Speaker 3>because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he said this a thousand years ago </v>

1881
01:33:18.720 --> 01:33:18.890
<v Speaker 3>where he had no evolutionary attorney,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I then I then package it as,</v>

1882
01:33:18.910 --> 01:33:23.910
<v Speaker 3>as an evolutionary argument because </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's great social signaling rewards </v>

1883
01:33:23.910 --> 01:33:27.340
<v Speaker 3>that come from you writing the Joe Rogan</v>
<v Speaker 3>cancer ward,</v>

1884
01:33:27.380 --> 01:33:28.720
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1885
01:33:29.500 --> 01:33:34.500
<v Speaker 3>If you are in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why do the upper uppers don't drive </v>

1886
01:33:34.500 --> 01:33:37.330
<v Speaker 3>maseratis because everybody in their </v>
<v Speaker 3>circle can also buy a Maserati.</v>

1887
01:33:37.420 --> 01:33:42.420
<v Speaker 3>So they actually drive pretty oftentime,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty cheapest cars because that's not </v>

1888
01:33:42.420 --> 01:33:47.161
<v Speaker 3>going to be a very honest signal of my </v>
<v Speaker 3>true value because everybody in my </v>

1889
01:33:47.161 --> 01:33:48.890
<v Speaker 3>social group can imitate it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if I can give $100,</v>

1890
01:33:48.891 --> 01:33:52.350
<v Speaker 3>million dollars to the soul and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>cancer or buy a $100,</v>

1891
01:33:52.351 --> 01:33:54.420
<v Speaker 3>million dollar painting that a two year </v>
<v Speaker 3>old could,</v>

1892
01:33:54.460 --> 01:33:55.720
<v Speaker 3>could have otherwise painted.</v>

1893
01:33:56.020 --> 01:33:57.880
<v Speaker 3>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's an honest signal of my quality.</v>

1894
01:33:57.881 --> 01:34:02.881
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I actually talk about this exact </v>

1895
01:34:02.881 --> 01:34:04.690
<v Speaker 3>idea of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of not advertising your generosity.</v>

1896
01:34:05.140 --> 01:34:06.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I call it happiness bombs.</v>

1897
01:34:06.701 --> 01:34:11.701
<v Speaker 3>When I leave a big tip at a restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get out of there before the waiter </v>

1898
01:34:11.701 --> 01:34:12.310
<v Speaker 3>could see what the Ta is nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like to do that.</v>

1899
01:34:12.370 --> 01:34:14.950
<v Speaker 3>I like to leave big tips and then run </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fuck out of there.</v>

1900
01:34:14.951 --> 01:34:19.951
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to see that person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I say thank you to them on the way out </v>

1901
01:34:19.951 --> 01:34:19.951
<v Speaker 3>the door,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't want to see the tip and then</v>

1902
01:34:19.951 --> 01:34:22.340
<v Speaker 3>thank me back because it almost like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1903
01:34:22.360 --> 01:34:23.560
<v Speaker 3>it takes away from it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1904
01:34:23.860 --> 01:34:28.860
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if someone donates a thousand dollars </v>

1905
01:34:28.860 --> 01:34:28.860
<v Speaker 3>but then tells the world they do a </v>
<v Speaker 3>$1,000,</v>

1906
01:34:28.860 --> 01:34:29.830
<v Speaker 3>I think you owe another thousand </v>
<v Speaker 3>dollars,</v>

1907
01:34:30.270 --> 01:34:32.230
<v Speaker 3>you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll always silent thousand.</v>

1908
01:34:32.700 --> 01:34:33.680
<v Speaker 3>Do you know the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1909
01:34:33.770 --> 01:34:35.350
<v Speaker 3>you must know the show curb your </v>
<v Speaker 3>enthusiasm.</v>

1910
01:34:35.350 --> 01:34:37.790
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's an episode on Tuesday,</v>

1911
01:34:37.830 --> 01:34:42.830
<v Speaker 3>Asm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where Larry David is at some function </v>

1912
01:34:42.830 --> 01:34:46.690
<v Speaker 3>with Ted Danson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They both gave anonymous donations,</v>

1913
01:34:46.870 --> 01:34:49.930
<v Speaker 3>but everybody keeps walking up to that </v>
<v Speaker 3>dance and telling you,</v>

1914
01:34:49.980 --> 01:34:51.790
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>congratulations on this donation.</v>

1915
01:34:51.791 --> 01:34:53.800
<v Speaker 3>That was so generous of you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Larry,</v>

1916
01:34:53.801 --> 01:34:55.840
<v Speaker 3>David go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>David goes crazy because he goes,</v>

1917
01:34:55.990 --> 01:34:56.890
<v Speaker 3>that's bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1918
01:34:56.891 --> 01:34:59.150
<v Speaker 3>You're from this whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not anonymous.</v>

1919
01:34:59.151 --> 01:35:01.430
<v Speaker 3>Nobody knows that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's exactly what we were talking about.</v>

1920
01:35:01.431 --> 01:35:06.431
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that whole episode was a great </v>

1921
01:35:06.431 --> 01:35:07.910
<v Speaker 3>episode because whoever wrote it </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually understands our human nature.</v>

1922
01:35:08.210 --> 01:35:09.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a fascinating,</v>

1923
01:35:09.651 --> 01:35:12.070
<v Speaker 3>fascinating aspect of human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>

1924
01:35:12.071 --> 01:35:14.770
<v Speaker 3>this need to be considered altruistic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1925
01:35:14.780 --> 01:35:19.780
<v Speaker 3>Need to be considered benevolent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know the to to advertise it instead </v>

1926
01:35:19.780 --> 01:35:24.431
<v Speaker 3>of just being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know that you can't exist in the </v>

1927
01:35:24.431 --> 01:35:27.140
<v Speaker 3>silence of the personal satisfaction of </v>
<v Speaker 3>contributing and giving,</v>

1928
01:35:27.141 --> 01:35:31.100
<v Speaker 3>giving out love and generosity that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to be rewarded for it.</v>

1929
01:35:31.130 --> 01:35:36.130
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a section in my first book which </v>

1930
01:35:36.130 --> 01:35:36.130
<v Speaker 3>I titled Philanthropy as a costly </v>
<v Speaker 3>signal,</v>

1931
01:35:36.710 --> 01:35:41.710
<v Speaker 3>constantly signaling and biology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the Peacock's tail is a constantly </v>

1932
01:35:41.710 --> 01:35:45.491
<v Speaker 3>signal because it actually serves as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>really honest signal of my worth for me </v>

1933
01:35:45.861 --> 01:35:48.980
<v Speaker 3>to carry this burden,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tail and avoid predators.</v>

1934
01:35:49.250 --> 01:35:54.250
<v Speaker 3>Then you really should take me seriously</v>
<v Speaker 3>all you female hands because here I am </v>

1935
01:35:54.250 --> 01:35:57.761
<v Speaker 3>here and I've survived.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's called an honest signal or a </v>

1936
01:35:57.761 --> 01:35:57.761
<v Speaker 3>costly sigma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1937
01:35:57.761 --> 01:36:00.650
<v Speaker 3>philanthropy I argue in many cases is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that us on a signal?</v>

1938
01:36:00.680 --> 01:36:02.270
<v Speaker 3>Precisely for the reasons that we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about.</v>

1939
01:36:02.271 --> 01:36:07.271
<v Speaker 3>So I am fascinated by peacocks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm fascinated by black guys who go to </v>

1940
01:36:07.271 --> 01:36:09.980
<v Speaker 3>clubs with $100,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>worth of jewelry on them.</v>

1941
01:36:10.460 --> 01:36:11.050
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1942
01:36:11.060 --> 01:36:12.530
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's amazing that,</v>

1943
01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:14.870
<v Speaker 3>that aspect of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially the rap community.</v>

1944
01:36:14.871 --> 01:36:15.200
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1945
01:36:15.201 --> 01:36:15.610
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1946
01:36:15.620 --> 01:36:17.700
<v Speaker 3>the throwing the money and all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>videos.</v>

1947
01:36:17.770 --> 01:36:20.600
<v Speaker 3>I'm making sure I got an article on </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1948
01:36:20.601 --> 01:36:23.090
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you ever think that you would have a</v>

1949
01:36:23.091 --> 01:36:27.140
<v Speaker 3>scientist on your show talking about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>evolutionary roots of making it rain?</v>

1950
01:36:27.310 --> 01:36:29.600
<v Speaker 3>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm so happy to be talking to you now.</v>

1951
01:36:29.610 --> 01:36:31.640
<v Speaker 3>I was happy to talk to you already,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now more so,</v>

1952
01:36:31.910 --> 01:36:32.860
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is,</v>

1953
01:36:33.230 --> 01:36:34.930
<v Speaker 3>what is that like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1954
01:36:34.931 --> 01:36:36.800
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the diamonds and the gold chains.</v>

1955
01:36:36.801 --> 01:36:41.801
<v Speaker 3>And then why is it specifically </v>
<v Speaker 3>connected to the African American </v>

1956
01:36:41.801 --> 01:36:43.450
<v Speaker 3>community as opposed to you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1957
01:36:43.700 --> 01:36:46.840
<v Speaker 3>the Italian American community was </v>
<v Speaker 3>always gold chains a little bit,</v>

1958
01:36:46.850 --> 01:36:51.850
<v Speaker 3>but not as much diamonds and mean black </v>
<v Speaker 3>people took it to a totally new level.</v>

1959
01:36:52.220 --> 01:36:53.090
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1960
01:36:53.110 --> 01:36:58.110
<v Speaker 3>I can't speak to why one culture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sides to use one particular form of </v>

1961
01:36:58.110 --> 01:37:00.710
<v Speaker 3>status.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're the mass tribe in Africa,</v>

1962
01:37:00.980 --> 01:37:03.320
<v Speaker 3>it might be the number of cattle heads </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you have.</v>

1963
01:37:03.350 --> 01:37:04.870
<v Speaker 3>That is the peacocking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1964
01:37:05.270 --> 01:37:10.270
<v Speaker 3>So what we do know is that different </v>
<v Speaker 3>cultures will use different forms of </v>

1965
01:37:10.270 --> 01:37:14.501
<v Speaker 3>peacocking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in all cultures it is going to be </v>

1966
01:37:14.501 --> 01:37:15.110
<v Speaker 3>the males in that culture who engage in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the act.</v>

1967
01:37:15.170 --> 01:37:20.170
<v Speaker 3>That's the universal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the peacock in the African American </v>

1968
01:37:20.170 --> 01:37:23.471
<v Speaker 3>community is most fascinating because a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of these rappers come from these </v>

1969
01:37:23.471 --> 01:37:25.730
<v Speaker 3>very poor neighborhoods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they're dealing with a lot of poverty</v>

1970
01:37:25.731 --> 01:37:29.990
<v Speaker 3>and crime and as they're growing up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then as they get older,</v>

1971
01:37:30.170 --> 01:37:35.170
<v Speaker 3>their identities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once they become connected to success </v>

1972
01:37:35.170 --> 01:37:38.060
<v Speaker 3>are also connected to firearms and and </v>
<v Speaker 3>diamonds.</v>

1973
01:37:38.660 --> 01:37:43.660
<v Speaker 3>Specifically diamonds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're all day blinged out everything </v>

1974
01:37:43.660 --> 01:37:43.660
<v Speaker 3>out teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1975
01:37:44.030 --> 01:37:46.760
<v Speaker 3>How crazy is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're walking around with 100,000</v>

1976
01:37:46.761 --> 01:37:50.090
<v Speaker 3>dollars with a dental appliances.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean probably more.</v>

1977
01:37:50.091 --> 01:37:51.910
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand diamonds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I don't.</v>

1978
01:37:51.911 --> 01:37:54.320
<v Speaker 3>I don't own any diamonds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so when I say 100,000</v>

1979
01:37:54.321 --> 01:37:55.010
<v Speaker 3>dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

1980
01:37:55.320 --> 01:37:57.990
<v Speaker 3>I might be way off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a company called,</v>

1981
01:37:58.710 --> 01:37:59.730
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember the name of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>company,</v>

1982
01:37:59.731 --> 01:38:02.580
<v Speaker 3>but the project was called American </v>
<v Speaker 3>brand stand.</v>

1983
01:38:02.940 --> 01:38:07.680
<v Speaker 3>A play on American bandstand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dick Clark,</v>

1984
01:38:07.681 --> 01:38:10.260
<v Speaker 3>they collect a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what they did is they did they,</v>

1985
01:38:10.300 --> 01:38:15.300
<v Speaker 3>they looked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they did a content analysis of brand </v>

1986
01:38:15.300 --> 01:38:18.951
<v Speaker 3>mentions in billboard top 100 to see how</v>
<v Speaker 3>often brands are mentioned.</v>

1987
01:38:20.710 --> 01:38:22.170
<v Speaker 3>Hey girl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got the Maserati.</v>

1988
01:38:22.470 --> 01:38:24.750
<v Speaker 3>And what they found,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not surprisingly,</v>

1989
01:38:24.990 --> 01:38:28.050
<v Speaker 3>is that it's almost exclusively in hip </v>
<v Speaker 3>hop videos.</v>

1990
01:38:28.270 --> 01:38:31.890
<v Speaker 3>It's almost exclusively male rappers who</v>
<v Speaker 3>do this behavior.</v>

1991
01:38:32.100 --> 01:38:33.750
<v Speaker 3>And it wasn't diamonds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually,</v>

1992
01:38:33.751 --> 01:38:35.670
<v Speaker 3>what the number one product was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cars.</v>

1993
01:38:36.420 --> 01:38:41.420
<v Speaker 3>So cars were overwhelmingly the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>often cited form of peacocking in rap </v>

1994
01:38:43.891 --> 01:38:44.910
<v Speaker 3>video,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in rap songs.</v>

1995
01:38:45.030 --> 01:38:46.130
<v Speaker 3>I was at a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1996
01:38:46.140 --> 01:38:48.240
<v Speaker 3>an event,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a kickboxing event in Los Angeles.</v>

1997
01:38:48.270 --> 01:38:49.770
<v Speaker 3>All my friends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eddie and tate,</v>

1998
01:38:49.771 --> 01:38:50.340
<v Speaker 3>and we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1999
01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:51.660
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we showed up.</v>

2000
01:38:51.661 --> 01:38:55.020
<v Speaker 3>This guy pulled up in this bright orange</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lamborghini,</v>

2001
01:38:55.021 --> 01:38:58.890
<v Speaker 3>this crazy car with a gold wing doors </v>
<v Speaker 3>that pop up.</v>

2002
01:38:59.370 --> 01:39:00.630
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2003
01:39:01.010 --> 01:39:03.060
<v Speaker 3>we were talking and I'm a fan of cars.</v>

2004
01:39:03.060 --> 01:39:05.910
<v Speaker 3>I love cars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I do not like lamborghinis.</v>

2005
01:39:05.911 --> 01:39:09.030
<v Speaker 3>I think they're foolish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the doors are foolish.</v>

2006
01:39:09.031 --> 01:39:14.031
<v Speaker 3>I mean they break all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a friend who reviews cars and he </v>

2007
01:39:14.031 --> 01:39:18.380
<v Speaker 3>reviewed this Lamborghini aventador and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he said it broke down after like two </v>

2008
01:39:18.380 --> 01:39:18.420
<v Speaker 3>days ahead of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for two days.</v>

2009
01:39:18.421 --> 01:39:23.421
<v Speaker 3>And the transmission exploded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was laughing about it and I was </v>

2010
01:39:23.421 --> 01:39:23.421
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>

2011
01:39:23.421 --> 01:39:25.350
<v Speaker 3>Like why would you spend a half a </v>
<v Speaker 3>million dollars on that car?</v>

2012
01:39:25.500 --> 01:39:28.590
<v Speaker 3>Like there's some brilliant pieces of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a big fan of cars.</v>

2013
01:39:28.591 --> 01:39:32.910
<v Speaker 3>I'm a big fan of engineering in general.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love well engineered watches.</v>

2014
01:39:32.911 --> 01:39:36.750
<v Speaker 3>I love a well engineered table.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love lapped fastened.</v>

2015
01:39:37.020 --> 01:39:42.020
<v Speaker 3>I'm fascinated by human innovation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when I see certain cars I am </v>

2016
01:39:42.020 --> 01:39:43.380
<v Speaker 3>fascinated by them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when I see that one,</v>

2017
01:39:43.381 --> 01:39:46.080
<v Speaker 3>I just think that's just so goofy and my</v>
<v Speaker 3>friends were like,</v>

2018
01:39:46.150 --> 01:39:48.520
<v Speaker 3>Bro,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that car gets you posted.</v>

2019
01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:50.080
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really?</v>

2020
01:39:50.081 --> 01:39:52.590
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't really like come on man is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>girl.</v>

2021
01:39:52.650 --> 01:39:55.080
<v Speaker 3>What a girl bank.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we had this debate with a girl,</v>

2022
01:39:55.200 --> 01:39:57.540
<v Speaker 3>have sex with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She saw you in that car.</v>

2023
01:39:57.570 --> 01:40:02.570
<v Speaker 3>Let me answer that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As opposed to please do as opposed to </v>

2024
01:40:02.570 --> 01:40:02.700
<v Speaker 3>let's say a corvette and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nah man,</v>

2025
01:40:02.701 --> 01:40:05.220
<v Speaker 3>anybody can get a corvette.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The corvette is like,</v>

2026
01:40:05.221 --> 01:40:06.270
<v Speaker 3>my friend goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2027
01:40:06.390 --> 01:40:08.460
<v Speaker 3>a girl will hop in your car just to see </v>
<v Speaker 3>where you live.</v>

2028
01:40:08.461 --> 01:40:10.620
<v Speaker 3>If you have that car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just want to see what your house.</v>

2029
01:40:10.730 --> 01:40:12.210
<v Speaker 3>You've got a $500,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>car.</v>

2030
01:40:12.300 --> 01:40:14.560
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck does that do to the house?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look like south?</v>

2031
01:40:14.590 --> 01:40:17.820
<v Speaker 3>Tell you three scientific studies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of which is mine,</v>

2032
01:40:17.880 --> 01:40:20.790
<v Speaker 3>and then a personal story of my brother </v>
<v Speaker 3>who lives in southern California.</v>

2033
01:40:21.220 --> 01:40:21.960
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so Nico,</v>

2034
01:40:21.970 --> 01:40:24.270
<v Speaker 3>I get down to the guy who did the breast</v>
<v Speaker 3>and French guy,</v>

2035
01:40:24.271 --> 01:40:29.271
<v Speaker 3>a French guy that did a study,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a very much similar in spirit where </v>

2036
01:40:29.271 --> 01:40:31.080
<v Speaker 3>instead of manipulating the firemen </v>
<v Speaker 3>sooth,</v>

2037
01:40:31.320 --> 01:40:36.320
<v Speaker 3>he had the same guy approach different </v>
<v Speaker 3>women as a function of an manipulated </v>

2038
01:40:36.361 --> 01:40:38.940
<v Speaker 3>which car he was driving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember the exact details,</v>

2039
01:40:38.941 --> 01:40:43.941
<v Speaker 3>but something like a three time increase</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the likelihood of a woman giving you</v>

2040
01:40:43.981 --> 01:40:48.981
<v Speaker 3>her phone number if you are driving high</v>
<v Speaker 3>status car versus a little status car </v>

2041
01:40:48.981 --> 01:40:50.550
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly three times three times </v>
<v Speaker 3>greater.</v>

2042
01:40:50.710 --> 01:40:52.560
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the same guy by the way,</v>

2043
01:40:52.800 --> 01:40:53.860
<v Speaker 3>that another study</v>

2044
01:40:54.100 --> 01:40:56.520
<v Speaker 5>where he.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yah,</v>

2045
01:40:56.590 --> 01:41:01.590
<v Speaker 5>he was either he made the guy who was </v>
<v Speaker 5>approaching the woman was either with a </v>

2046
01:41:01.590 --> 01:41:05.610
<v Speaker 5>baby or not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and another version with a dog or not </v>

2047
01:41:05.610 --> 01:41:09.900
<v Speaker 5>having a dog increases digits uptake,</v>
<v Speaker 5>invention and have interacting with the </v>

2048
01:41:11.351 --> 01:41:16.351
<v Speaker 5>baby also increases.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I joke that you should be driving a </v>

2049
01:41:16.351 --> 01:41:21.030
<v Speaker 5>Lamborghini while having a dog next to </v>
<v Speaker 5>you and it baby while wearing a </v>

2050
01:41:21.030 --> 01:41:24.730
<v Speaker 5>fireman's suit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're going to get all the ladies in </v>

2051
01:41:24.730 --> 01:41:29.140
<v Speaker 5>Orange County and in Newport beach,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so that's one and another study,</v>

2052
01:41:29.141 --> 01:41:32.290
<v Speaker 5>and then I'm going to come to my study </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the second and another study,</v>

2053
01:41:32.291 --> 01:41:35.410
<v Speaker 5>not by this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They took the same men,</v>

2054
01:41:35.740 --> 01:41:38.860
<v Speaker 5>put them either in a Bentley or in a </v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever,</v>

2055
01:41:38.861 --> 01:41:43.861
<v Speaker 5>Ford Fiesta and did the same thing with </v>
<v Speaker 5>the same with a wound and then it those </v>

2056
01:41:43.861 --> 01:41:48.810
<v Speaker 5>opposite sex rating so the women would </v>
<v Speaker 5>rate the two guys and the same guy when </v>

2057
01:41:49.331 --> 01:41:54.331
<v Speaker 5>he is in the Bentley,</v>
<v Speaker 5>was viewed as astonishingly more </v>

2058
01:41:54.331 --> 01:41:55.810
<v Speaker 5>handsome.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Which of course objectives can be.</v>

2059
01:41:55.811 --> 01:41:58.750
<v Speaker 5>I mean you have your physiology.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If your physical traits don't change,</v>

2060
01:41:59.050 --> 01:42:01.870
<v Speaker 5>but there was a glow effect from the car</v>
<v Speaker 5>that he's driving.</v>

2061
01:42:02.140 --> 01:42:03.470
<v Speaker 5>He's handsome,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's,</v>

2062
01:42:03.500 --> 01:42:06.670
<v Speaker 5>he's a Brad Pitt and this car.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's a loser in this other car,</v>

2063
01:42:06.820 --> 01:42:10.030
<v Speaker 5>but the same manipulation on women.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Men didn't care.</v>

2064
01:42:10.060 --> 01:42:15.060
<v Speaker 5>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 5>their evaluations of how attractive the </v>

2065
01:42:15.060 --> 01:42:17.551
<v Speaker 5>woman was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That not depend on which car she was </v>

2066
01:42:17.551 --> 01:42:17.551
<v Speaker 5>seated in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so</v>

2067
01:42:17.551 --> 01:42:20.610
<v Speaker 1>I would think that with men and with </v>
<v Speaker 1>women that the women,</v>

2068
01:42:20.611 --> 01:42:24.930
<v Speaker 1>it would be more intimidating to the men</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the women drove a Bentley all because</v>

2069
01:42:25.210 --> 01:42:29.460
<v Speaker 1>they have status perhaps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well especially if you have a Toyota,</v>

2070
01:42:29.461 --> 01:42:31.320
<v Speaker 1>some crappy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nice car,</v>

2071
01:42:31.321 --> 01:42:32.070
<v Speaker 1>Toyota,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2072
01:42:32.520 --> 01:42:35.130
<v Speaker 1>not a bad car but just not a high status</v>
<v Speaker 1>car.</v>

2073
01:42:35.280 --> 01:42:37.290
<v Speaker 1>But if you pulled up in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2074
01:42:37.860 --> 01:42:38.700
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2075
01:42:38.730 --> 01:42:39.540
<v Speaker 1>name it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chevy,</v>

2076
01:42:39.541 --> 01:42:41.910
<v Speaker 1>cobalt or something like that and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2077
01:42:41.911 --> 01:42:43.260
<v Speaker 1>the girl you're going to go on a date </v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

2078
01:42:43.261 --> 01:42:45.030
<v Speaker 1>pulls up in a Lamborghini like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

2079
01:42:45.031 --> 01:42:46.160
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2080
01:42:46.410 --> 01:42:49.040
<v Speaker 1>I would think that for some men they </v>
<v Speaker 1>find that someone,</v>

2081
01:42:49.170 --> 01:42:53.080
<v Speaker 1>men find women that are very successful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intimidating here.</v>

2082
01:42:53.150 --> 01:42:58.150
<v Speaker 1>They were just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were just asking them how good </v>

2083
01:42:58.150 --> 01:42:58.500
<v Speaker 1>looking do you think they are?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So specific to physical attraction.</v>

2084
01:42:58.530 --> 01:42:59.120
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2085
01:42:59.220 --> 01:43:00.030
<v Speaker 1>So the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2086
01:43:00.031 --> 01:43:02.400
<v Speaker 1>I would say the physical attraction </v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't change,</v>

2087
01:43:02.401 --> 01:43:07.401
<v Speaker 1>but I would say that the desire to </v>
<v Speaker 1>approach that person or the willingness </v>

2088
01:43:07.401 --> 01:43:07.401
<v Speaker 1>to approach that person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm with you.</v>

2089
01:43:07.401 --> 01:43:07.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

2090
01:43:07.771 --> 01:43:08.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>women with,</v>

2091
01:43:08.430 --> 01:43:11.250
<v Speaker 1>with like a really expensive car would </v>
<v Speaker 1>be intimidating.</v>

2092
01:43:11.750 --> 01:43:14.510
<v Speaker 5>Third Study and then the personal story </v>
<v Speaker 5>from my brother,</v>

2093
01:43:14.820 --> 01:43:19.820
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I did a study a few years ago where I </v>

2094
01:43:19.820 --> 01:43:22.001
<v Speaker 5>brought.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This was a former graduate student of </v>

2095
01:43:22.001 --> 01:43:24.461
<v Speaker 5>mine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We brought people into the lab and then </v>

2096
01:43:24.461 --> 01:43:27.170
<v Speaker 5>we rented a porsche.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This wasn't imagined.</v>

2097
01:43:27.200 --> 01:43:30.170
<v Speaker 5>You're driving a porsche.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We actually rented a Porsche and as I,</v>

2098
01:43:30.410 --> 01:43:33.530
<v Speaker 5>as I tell one of my ted talks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>try to get a,</v>

2099
01:43:33.531 --> 01:43:37.340
<v Speaker 5>a granting agency to release money to do</v>
<v Speaker 5>research where you're going,</v>

2100
01:43:37.610 --> 01:43:42.610
<v Speaker 5>where you're saying we're saying I'm </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to rent a porsche for the weekend </v>

2101
01:43:42.610 --> 01:43:42.610
<v Speaker 5>as part of my research.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

2102
01:43:42.610 --> 01:43:44.210
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we rented a Porsche and then we had some</v>

2103
01:43:44.211 --> 01:43:49.211
<v Speaker 5>other beaten up car and we had the same </v>
<v Speaker 5>men drive both cars either in downtown </v>

2104
01:43:50.541 --> 01:43:55.541
<v Speaker 5>Montreal on a Friday evening where </v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody could see you driving the car </v>

2105
01:43:55.541 --> 01:43:56.480
<v Speaker 5>or on a semi desert highway where nobody</v>
<v Speaker 5>could see you.</v>

2106
01:43:56.770 --> 01:43:58.700
<v Speaker 5>And at the end of each of the driving </v>
<v Speaker 5>conditions,</v>

2107
01:43:58.970 --> 01:44:03.970
<v Speaker 5>we collected salivary assets to then </v>
<v Speaker 5>measure their fluctuating levels of </v>

2108
01:44:05.061 --> 01:44:05.840
<v Speaker 5>testosterone.</v>

2109
01:44:06.230 --> 01:44:09.170
<v Speaker 5>And the idea being that when you put </v>
<v Speaker 5>them in the Porsche,</v>

2110
01:44:09.440 --> 01:44:11.930
<v Speaker 5>it's going to explode and that's exactly</v>
<v Speaker 5>what we found.</v>

2111
01:44:12.690 --> 01:44:15.110
<v Speaker 5>And now one of the reviewers had </v>
<v Speaker 5>written,</v>

2112
01:44:15.410 --> 01:44:16.350
<v Speaker 5>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

2113
01:44:16.370 --> 01:44:18.830
<v Speaker 5>How do you know that that's just not </v>
<v Speaker 5>because they're driving fast.</v>

2114
01:44:18.860 --> 01:44:21.170
<v Speaker 5>And so that's causing a rise in </v>
<v Speaker 5>testosterone.</v>

2115
01:44:21.470 --> 01:44:26.470
<v Speaker 5>And the way we could control for that is</v>
<v Speaker 5>an downtown Montreal on a Friday </v>

2116
01:44:26.470 --> 01:44:28.520
<v Speaker 5>evening.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's bumper to bumper traffic.</v>

2117
01:44:28.550 --> 01:44:29.060
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's,</v>

2118
01:44:29.070 --> 01:44:30.950
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like being in a parking lot,</v>

2119
01:44:31.160 --> 01:44:33.950
<v Speaker 5>so it's certainly not because you were </v>
<v Speaker 5>driving fast.</v>

2120
01:44:34.160 --> 01:44:37.760
<v Speaker 5>It's because everybody could see that I </v>
<v Speaker 5>am sitting in a porsche.</v>

2121
01:44:37.940 --> 01:44:42.940
<v Speaker 5>So you're endocrinological system </v>
<v Speaker 5>exploded simply because of this imbuing </v>

2122
01:44:42.940 --> 01:44:47.740
<v Speaker 5>of social status to you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And we know this from other animals </v>

2123
01:44:47.740 --> 01:44:47.740
<v Speaker 5>where if you and I fight,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if we're two males,</v>

2124
01:44:47.740 --> 01:44:48.620
<v Speaker 5>we fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you win,</v>

2125
01:44:48.621 --> 01:44:51.560
<v Speaker 5>your testosterone goes up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If I lose my testosterone goes down.</v>

2126
01:44:51.920 --> 01:44:54.680
<v Speaker 5>And so here we were applying this exact </v>
<v Speaker 5>idea to the consumer setting.</v>

2127
01:44:55.010 --> 01:45:00.010
<v Speaker 1>So the person that was in the fast car </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was on all deserted stretch of </v>

2128
01:45:00.501 --> 01:45:03.160
<v Speaker 1>highway just going fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their testosterone didn't rise.</v>

2129
01:45:03.190 --> 01:45:03.740
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it did.</v>

2130
01:45:03.790 --> 01:45:04.770
<v Speaker 1>It did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We actually</v>

2131
01:45:04.850 --> 01:45:09.500
<v Speaker 5>predicted that it would rise in both </v>
<v Speaker 5>those conditions,</v>

2132
01:45:09.770 --> 01:45:14.770
<v Speaker 5>but it would rise more when there's a </v>
<v Speaker 5>public audience to see you doing it.</v>

2133
01:45:15.260 --> 01:45:20.260
<v Speaker 5>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What we found is that irrespective of </v>

2134
01:45:20.260 --> 01:45:21.650
<v Speaker 5>the environment,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you put a young male and a Porsche,</v>

2135
01:45:21.830 --> 01:45:24.740
<v Speaker 5>has endocrinological system explodes at </v>
<v Speaker 5>the.</v>

2136
01:45:24.790 --> 01:45:29.790
<v Speaker 5>So the environment didn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just the fact that you are interviewing </v>

2137
01:45:29.790 --> 01:45:30.330
<v Speaker 5>me with this immediate social status,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2138
01:45:30.560 --> 01:45:32.540
<v Speaker 5>resulted in the same increase in </v>
<v Speaker 5>testosterone.</v>

2139
01:45:32.550 --> 01:45:37.550
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there isn't it also an engine thing too </v>

2140
01:45:37.550 --> 01:45:39.951
<v Speaker 1>with young men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that they've done studies where </v>

2141
01:45:39.951 --> 01:45:41.610
<v Speaker 1>they had young men rev engines just like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a v eight,</v>

2142
01:45:41.750 --> 01:45:46.750
<v Speaker 1>a powerful va.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just the sound of that increases </v>

2143
01:45:46.750 --> 01:45:47.340
<v Speaker 1>testosterone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>increases testosterone.</v>

2144
01:45:47.370 --> 01:45:48.590
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that study.</v>

2145
01:45:48.670 --> 01:45:50.550
<v Speaker 1>You ain't gonna need to send me that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2146
01:45:50.810 --> 01:45:52.540
<v Speaker 1>I will as soon as I find it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2147
01:45:52.650 --> 01:45:53.730
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2148
01:45:53.760 --> 01:45:58.760
<v Speaker 1>the test that you give them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much of a variable or how much of a </v>

2149
01:45:58.760 --> 01:46:02.511
<v Speaker 1>variance was there between not driving </v>
<v Speaker 1>that car and driving that car </v>

2150
01:46:02.700 --> 01:46:07.700
<v Speaker 1>statistically significant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was certainly strong enough to </v>

2151
01:46:07.700 --> 01:46:09.180
<v Speaker 1>pick up a big difference from the toyota</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the other car.</v>

2152
01:46:09.480 --> 01:46:11.100
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember the percentage?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2153
01:46:11.160 --> 01:46:13.770
<v Speaker 1>I could send you the paper would be big </v>
<v Speaker 1>for athletes.</v>

2154
01:46:13.800 --> 01:46:18.800
<v Speaker 1>Just drive around in a fast car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be good for your recovery because </v>

2155
01:46:18.800 --> 01:46:19.540
<v Speaker 1>testosterone with it.</v>

2156
01:46:20.350 --> 01:46:25.350
<v Speaker 5>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>With my wife and I tell her that since </v>

2157
01:46:25.350 --> 01:46:26.870
<v Speaker 5>men as they enter middle age,</v>
<v Speaker 5>their testosterone goes down.</v>

2158
01:46:27.170 --> 01:46:30.320
<v Speaker 5>If I now have to buy a luxury car that's</v>
<v Speaker 5>just medically mandated,</v>

2159
01:46:30.940 --> 01:46:35.450
<v Speaker 1>well is that what's going on when men </v>
<v Speaker 1>have this midlife crisis,</v>

2160
01:46:35.690 --> 01:46:40.690
<v Speaker 1>like that's always the joke with women </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they see a guy in a ferrari and </v>

2161
01:46:40.821 --> 01:46:42.740
<v Speaker 1>he's like 50 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry about your penis,</v>

2162
01:46:44.540 --> 01:46:46.610
<v Speaker 1>but is that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I did.</v>

2163
01:46:46.670 --> 01:46:49.860
<v Speaker 1>I have a study that's not yet published.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Speaking the car.</v>

2164
01:46:49.861 --> 01:46:50.010
<v Speaker 1>You</v>

2165
01:46:50.010 --> 01:46:52.770
<v Speaker 5>drive in some morphological features,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're going to like this one.</v>

2166
01:46:53.880 --> 01:46:56.640
<v Speaker 5>So this is not published yet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>With one of my former doctoral students,</v>

2167
01:46:56.970 --> 01:47:01.970
<v Speaker 5>we actually have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We created online dating profiles of a </v>

2168
01:47:01.970 --> 01:47:05.961
<v Speaker 5>man where everything's the same except </v>
<v Speaker 5>that in one version his prized favorite </v>

2169
01:47:06.811 --> 01:47:11.811
<v Speaker 5>position is a fancy red porsche or some </v>
<v Speaker 5>shitty key or whatever it is.</v>

2170
01:47:12.510 --> 01:47:17.510
<v Speaker 5>And then we asked men and women who were</v>
<v Speaker 5>looking at this profile to evaluate the </v>

2171
01:47:17.731 --> 01:47:21.270
<v Speaker 5>guy's height.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Watch what happened.</v>

2172
01:47:21.840 --> 01:47:26.840
<v Speaker 5>Men,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when they evaluate the guy with the </v>

2173
01:47:26.840 --> 01:47:29.811
<v Speaker 5>porsche denigrate has height,</v>
<v Speaker 5>shorter women increases height.</v>

2174
01:47:30.720 --> 01:47:33.390
<v Speaker 5>This is exactly what you would expect </v>
<v Speaker 5>from an evolutionary perspective,</v>

2175
01:47:33.391 --> 01:47:33.910
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

2176
01:47:33.990 --> 01:47:37.020
<v Speaker 5>Right status as a threatening queue for </v>
<v Speaker 5>men.</v>

2177
01:47:37.290 --> 01:47:40.170
<v Speaker 5>Therefore it serves as an intrasexual </v>
<v Speaker 5>rivalry queue.</v>

2178
01:47:40.290 --> 01:47:42.870
<v Speaker 5>So if you are in a fancy car or joe must</v>
<v Speaker 5>be some short,</v>

2179
01:47:42.871 --> 01:47:44.970
<v Speaker 5>wimpy guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>women on the other hand,</v>

2180

<v Speaker 5>and say,</v>

2182
01:47:49.081 --> 01:47:50.340
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>joe was a tall guy.</v>

2183
01:47:50.810 --> 01:47:53.790
<v Speaker 5>Very fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You should study haters.</v>

2184
01:47:54.080 --> 01:47:59.080
<v Speaker 5>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You should study like haters of </v>

2185
01:47:59.080 --> 01:48:01.131
<v Speaker 5>celebrities,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like someone who becomes like a justin </v>

2186
01:48:01.131 --> 01:48:01.240
<v Speaker 5>bieber type character,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially someone who's a,</v>

2187
01:48:01.260 --> 01:48:06.260
<v Speaker 5>a famous person who women just go like </v>
<v Speaker 5>if justin bieber goes anywhere in </v>

2188
01:48:06.260 --> 01:48:09.471
<v Speaker 5>public,</v>
<v Speaker 5>women will literally scream and pass </v>

01:48:09.471 --> 01:48:13.320
<v Speaker 5>Like in some ways he's just study like </v>
<v Speaker 5>what the reaction is to men.</v>

2191
01:48:13.321 --> 01:48:15.150
<v Speaker 5>I wonder if there's a latest study that </v>
<v Speaker 5>that is.</v>

2192
01:48:15.180 --> 01:48:17.880

<v Speaker 5>StudYing haters.</v>

<v Speaker 5>That's a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So let me tell you about my,</v>

2194
01:48:19.620 --> 01:48:20.880
<v Speaker 5>are we still okay on time?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2195
01:48:20.881 --> 01:48:22.140
<v Speaker 5>that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We have an hour.</v>

2196
01:48:22.230 --> 01:48:23.500
<v Speaker 5>Oh great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2197
01:48:23.730 --> 01:48:27.090
<v Speaker 5>so I have a brother who was living in </v>
<v Speaker 5>California for 30 years at,</v>

2198
01:48:27.210 --> 01:48:32.210
<v Speaker 5>who,</v>
<v Speaker 5>by the way I think I'd sent you this </v>

2199
01:48:32.210 --> 01:48:32.210
<v Speaker 5>email,</v>
<v Speaker 5>was a fighter,</v>

2200
01:48:32.210 --> 01:48:35.811
<v Speaker 5>was a judo olympian,</v>
<v Speaker 5>judo fighter who played in the 19 plate </v>

2201
01:48:35.811 --> 01:48:37.230
<v Speaker 5>who competed in the 1976 olympics.</v>

2202
01:48:37.590 --> 01:48:39.120
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he used to always say,</v>

2203
01:48:39.121 --> 01:48:41.160
<v Speaker 5>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>before it was ever an entity,</v>

2204
01:48:41.220 --> 01:48:46.220
<v Speaker 5>I would always ask them if you were in a</v>
<v Speaker 5>fight at a bar against some boxer or </v>

2205
01:48:48.181 --> 01:48:52.620
<v Speaker 5>some karate guy who would win,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which was kind of what started the whole</v>

2206
01:48:52.621 --> 01:48:55.170
<v Speaker 5>mna thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he used to alwaYs tell me,</v>

2207
01:48:55.710 --> 01:49:00.710
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I will destroy them because they might </v>

2208
01:49:00.710 --> 01:49:01.290
<v Speaker 5>get one hit on me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but once I get them,</v>

2209
01:49:01.560 --> 01:49:03.950
<v Speaker 5>then once we go down on the ground </v>
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>

2210
01:49:04.060 --> 01:49:05.240
<v Speaker 5>they're done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2211
01:49:05.430 --> 01:49:06.280
<v Speaker 5>so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2212
01:49:06.300 --> 01:49:07.000
<v Speaker 5>so he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

2213
01:49:07.030 --> 01:49:12.030
<v Speaker 5>he made a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of money in the software industry </v>

2214
01:49:12.030 --> 01:49:13.380
<v Speaker 5>in southern California.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so he used,</v>

2215
01:49:13.410 --> 01:49:16.110
<v Speaker 5>he was the classic kind of peacocking </v>
<v Speaker 5>guy.</v>

2216
01:49:16.111 --> 01:49:19.480
<v Speaker 5>He owned three ferrari's and aston </v>
<v Speaker 5>martIn lagoon,</v>

2217
01:49:19.490 --> 01:49:24.490
<v Speaker 5>the so on and so we would.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He would play this game to,</v>

2218
01:49:25.100 --> 01:49:26.310
<v Speaker 5>to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to my chagrin,</v>

2219
01:49:26.340 --> 01:49:27.300
<v Speaker 5>he liked to play this game.</v>

2220
01:49:27.300 --> 01:49:32.300
<v Speaker 5>We'd go to a nightclub.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is before I was married in case my </v>

2221
01:49:32.300 --> 01:49:35.190
<v Speaker 5>wife was listening,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but this was before we were married.</v>

2222
01:49:36.450 --> 01:49:40.410
<v Speaker 5>We would walk into a bar,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these fancy schmancy clubs,</v>

2223
01:49:40.770 --> 01:49:45.770
<v Speaker 5>and he'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>take your time and look around and find </v>

2224
01:49:45.770 --> 01:49:48.040
<v Speaker 5>the most stunning unattainable in this </v>
<v Speaker 5>space.</v>

2225
01:49:48.100 --> 01:49:51.160
<v Speaker 5>Not take yoUr time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I'd go around,</v>

2226
01:49:51.161 --> 01:49:56.161
<v Speaker 5>look around.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I picked the girl who's not only the </v>

2227
01:49:56.161 --> 01:49:58.831
<v Speaker 5>most beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the one who is clearly accompanied </v>

2228
01:49:58.831 --> 01:50:02.281
<v Speaker 5>by a guy who looks like a brute and they</v>
<v Speaker 5>seem to be very intensely in love.</v>

2229
01:50:03.220 --> 01:50:08.220
<v Speaker 5>So now it's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've really raised the bar of him not </v>

2230
01:50:08.220 --> 01:50:08.220
<v Speaker 5>being able to get her.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now.</v>

2231
01:50:08.220 --> 01:50:08.220
<v Speaker 5>My brother is about five,</v>
<v Speaker 5>four,</v>

2232
01:50:08.220 --> 01:50:09.080
<v Speaker 5>three.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you know,</v>

2233
01:50:09.120 --> 01:50:14.120
<v Speaker 5>he's not taught so on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But boise carrying the big testicles of </v>

2234
01:50:14.120 --> 01:50:15.750
<v Speaker 5>owning almost ferrari's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so he said,</v>

2235
01:50:15.760 --> 01:50:16.450
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the goal.</v>

2236
01:50:16.451 --> 01:50:16.860
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

2237
01:50:16.910 --> 01:50:18.220
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you want me to approach?</v>

2238
01:50:18.310 --> 01:50:23.310
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the she had to wait like a shark and </v>

2239
01:50:23.310 --> 01:50:24.550
<v Speaker 5>then the girl and the guy would go to </v>
<v Speaker 5>the bathroom.</v>

2240
01:50:25.720 --> 01:50:28.870
<v Speaker 5>He approached the girl he'd,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he'd come up to about here on her.</v>

2241
01:50:28.900 --> 01:50:30.520
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was just incredible to watch.</v>

2242
01:50:31.180 --> 01:50:33.550
<v Speaker 5>He'd come back to me and say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she'll call me tomorrow.</v>

2243
01:50:33.960 --> 01:50:35.830
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>absolutely zero chance.</v>

2244
01:50:35.831 --> 01:50:36.940
<v Speaker 5>David's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not going to happen.</v>

2245
01:50:37.030 --> 01:50:38.860
<v Speaker 5>Next morning he'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>come over here.</v>

2246
01:50:39.200 --> 01:50:44.200
<v Speaker 5>It.</v>
<v Speaker 5>At the time we had the answering </v>

2247
01:50:44.200 --> 01:50:44.200
<v Speaker 5>machines.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is like maybe early nineties.</v>

2248
01:50:44.590 --> 01:50:45.940
<v Speaker 5>Hi david.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's candy.</v>

2249
01:50:45.941 --> 01:50:46.660
<v Speaker 5>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we met.</v>

2250
01:50:46.680 --> 01:50:49.930
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well what got him candy?</v>

2251
01:50:50.170 --> 01:50:51.250
<v Speaker 5>It was the fact that.</v>

2252
01:50:51.560 --> 01:50:53.370
<v Speaker 3>What would you say to them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2253
01:50:53.490 --> 01:50:55.520
<v Speaker 3>I have three ferrari's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come with me.</v>

2254
01:50:55.590 --> 01:50:59.190
<v Speaker 3>I like the you arabic accent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know you have a man,</v>

2255
01:50:59.191 --> 01:51:00.840
<v Speaker 3>but he is stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is big,</v>

2256
01:51:00.841 --> 01:51:04.040
<v Speaker 3>but he does not have cars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But look,</v>

2257
01:51:04.050 --> 01:51:07.590
<v Speaker 3>the reality is that whenever we went </v>
<v Speaker 3>anywhere in one of those cars,</v>

2258
01:51:07.650 --> 01:51:11.130
<v Speaker 3>I just noticed anecdotally that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>women would be all over the place.</v>

2259
01:51:11.160 --> 01:51:16.160
<v Speaker 3>Is that changing with time when people </v>
<v Speaker 3>become more aware of how kind of </v>

2260
01:51:16.160 --> 01:51:19.600
<v Speaker 3>peacocky and it becomes more of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>cultural sort of a caricature too?</v>

2261
01:51:20.720 --> 01:51:20.930
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2262
01:51:21.290 --> 01:51:26.290
<v Speaker 5>I think what happens is that the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the product that we use for the </v>

2263
01:51:26.290 --> 01:51:27.560
<v Speaker 5>peacocking might change.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So for example,</v>

2264
01:51:27.561 --> 01:51:31.910
<v Speaker 5>maybe in the cafe sipping a parties in </v>
<v Speaker 5>hollywood.</v>

2265
01:51:31.940 --> 01:51:34.360
<v Speaker 5>It might be that I drive a prius.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You.</v>

2266
01:51:34.370 --> 01:51:36.590
<v Speaker 5>I was so happy you just said that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2267
01:51:36.800 --> 01:51:38.580
<v Speaker 5>So that now makes me the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2268
01:51:38.590 --> 01:51:43.590
<v Speaker 5>the top dog.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is actually a paid for by a </v>

2269
01:51:43.590 --> 01:51:43.590
<v Speaker 5>colleague of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's called</v>

2270
01:51:43.590 --> 01:51:48.420
<v Speaker 3>green to be seen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is basically a form of conspicuous</v>

2271
01:51:49.241 --> 01:51:54.241
<v Speaker 3>consumption based on being green rather </v>
<v Speaker 3>than being in the big hummer or </v>

2272
01:51:54.241 --> 01:51:58.501
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the bottom line is that the signal </v>

2273
01:51:58.501 --> 01:52:01.171
<v Speaker 3>itself will change,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the need to signal as a form of a </v>

2274
01:52:01.171 --> 01:52:03.880
<v Speaker 3>mating strategy is always they're more </v>
<v Speaker 3>progressive brownie points.</v>

2275
01:52:04.510 --> 01:52:08.050
<v Speaker 3>I keep track of the amount of prius's </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I catch throwing cigarettes out the</v>

2276
01:52:08.051 --> 01:52:09.220
<v Speaker 3>window.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm up to eight,</v>

2277
01:52:09.950 --> 01:52:14.950
<v Speaker 3>eight creases in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have observed throwing cigarettes out </v>

2278
01:52:14.950 --> 01:52:18.631
<v Speaker 3>the window.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get fucking furious because I know </v>

2279
01:52:18.631 --> 01:52:18.820
<v Speaker 3>those fucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know what they're doing right?</v>

2280
01:52:18.940 --> 01:52:20.680
<v Speaker 3>They dry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of them drive those things,</v>

2281
01:52:20.681 --> 01:52:23.020
<v Speaker 3>not for the consumption,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not for gas,</v>

2282
01:52:23.230 --> 01:52:26.800
<v Speaker 3>low keeping gas prices down there doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>it because they want to appear green.</v>

2283
01:52:26.860 --> 01:52:27.370
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

2284
01:52:29.240 --> 01:52:34.240
<v Speaker 5>There's actually studies that look at </v>
<v Speaker 5>how much are you willing to pay extra </v>

2285
01:52:35.170 --> 01:52:40.170
<v Speaker 5>for a green product and oftentimes what </v>
<v Speaker 5>people say attitudinally and then what </v>

2286
01:52:41.051 --> 01:52:44.920
<v Speaker 5>they do if it affects their dollar,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a big and continually so you see</v>

2287
01:52:44.921 --> 01:52:46.250
<v Speaker 5>the ocracy of people.</v>

2288
01:52:46.250 --> 01:52:46.970
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

2289
01:52:46.971 --> 01:52:47.960
<v Speaker 1>as the posing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2290
01:52:48.430 --> 01:52:50.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean I want to appear as though I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>enlightened,</v>

2291
01:52:50.300 --> 01:52:52.370
<v Speaker 1>progressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I care about mother earth and so.</v>

2292
01:52:52.880 --> 01:52:55.850
<v Speaker 1>Well most certainly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm a hunter and I've experienced</v>

2293
01:52:55.851 --> 01:53:00.851
<v Speaker 1>this weird thing where people who were </v>
<v Speaker 1>leather and eat meat get angry at you </v>

2294
01:53:00.981 --> 01:53:05.981
<v Speaker 1>for hunting and one of the reasons why </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're angry at you for hunting is </v>

2295
01:53:05.981 --> 01:53:08.450
<v Speaker 1>somehow or another what you're doing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>animal cruelty that you don't have to do</v>

2296
01:53:08.451 --> 01:53:09.980
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why not go to a supermarket?</v>

2297
01:53:09.981 --> 01:53:13.250
<v Speaker 1>This was like incredibly narrow minded </v>
<v Speaker 1>way of thinking and I'm like,</v>

2298
01:53:13.251 --> 01:53:16.280
<v Speaker 1>you have a leather couch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you understand that?</v>

2299
01:53:16.281 --> 01:53:20.780
<v Speaker 1>The animal that you set it on every day </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffered,</v>

2300
01:53:20.810 --> 01:53:23.740
<v Speaker 1>unimaginable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cruel to the animal that I shot,</v>

2301
01:53:23.750 --> 01:53:26.750
<v Speaker 1>didn't even know I was there until I put</v>
<v Speaker 1>an arrow through.</v>

2302
01:53:26.751 --> 01:53:31.751
<v Speaker 1>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever feel any gumption at doing </v>

2303
01:53:31.751 --> 01:53:31.910
<v Speaker 1>it or no?</v>

2304
01:53:32.180 --> 01:53:33.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2305
01:53:33.281 --> 01:53:35.870
<v Speaker 1>That definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not an easy thing to do.</v>

2306
01:53:35.970 --> 01:53:37.250
<v Speaker 1>It's not I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I eat meat.</v>

2307
01:53:37.280 --> 01:53:38.900
<v Speaker 1>I liked me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always eaten meat.</v>

2308
01:53:38.960 --> 01:53:43.960
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've worked out a lot and I find that </v>

2309
01:53:43.960 --> 01:53:43.960
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

2310
01:53:43.960 --> 01:53:43.960
<v Speaker 1>I've tried being a vegetarian once when </v>
<v Speaker 1>I was competing,</v>

2311
01:53:43.960 --> 01:53:48.740
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back when I was fighting and I didn't </v>

2312
01:53:48.740 --> 01:53:49.520
<v Speaker 1>perform as wild and have as much energy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it feels good and granted,</v>

2313
01:53:49.760 --> 01:53:54.760
<v Speaker 1>in all fairness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my knowledge of nutrition was far less </v>

2314
01:53:54.760 --> 01:53:58.631
<v Speaker 1>than than it is now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I didn't have the beSt diet in the </v>

2315
01:53:58.631 --> 01:53:58.700
<v Speaker 1>world was also very young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

2316
01:53:58.950 --> 01:54:00.180
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2317
01:54:00.500 --> 01:54:05.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals like humans live a finite life </v>

2318
01:54:05.500 --> 01:54:06.830
<v Speaker 1>and I think that they eat each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're the world that they live in is.</v>

2319
01:54:06.831 --> 01:54:10.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm an unbelievably cruel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if it wasn't for getting killed by a</v>

2320
01:54:10.611 --> 01:54:15.611
<v Speaker 1>hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like they're going to live </v>

2321
01:54:15.611 --> 01:54:15.611
<v Speaker 1>forever and become magic.</v>

2322
01:54:15.611 --> 01:54:15.611
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

2323
01:54:15.611 --> 01:54:19.430
<v Speaker 1>they get killed by coyotes and mountain </v>
<v Speaker 1>lions and I like going into that world </v>

2324
01:54:19.430 --> 01:54:22.370
<v Speaker 1>and acquiring meet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My goal is at the end of 2014.</v>

2325
01:54:22.400 --> 01:54:25.370
<v Speaker 1>All the meat I eat at home to only be </v>
<v Speaker 1>from my hunting.</v>

2326
01:54:25.371 --> 01:54:26.270
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2327
01:54:26.271 --> 01:54:29.210
<v Speaker 1>Because I feel like that's the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>ethical way to do this.</v>

2328
01:54:29.270 --> 01:54:32.780
<v Speaker 1>I go to different places like I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2329
01:54:32.840 --> 01:54:36.290
<v Speaker 1>I've only been hunting for times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shot two deer.</v>

2330
01:54:36.620 --> 01:54:41.620
<v Speaker 1>I shot a pig and a wild pig and a shot a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bayer recently,</v>

2331
01:54:41.990 --> 01:54:44.840
<v Speaker 1>only animals that I eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only animals that I want to eat.</v>

2332
01:54:45.140 --> 01:54:50.140
<v Speaker 1>And my freezer is filled with bear meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>venison and yeah,</v>

2333
01:54:50.391 --> 01:54:51.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I,</v>

2334
01:54:51.410 --> 01:54:53.090
<v Speaker 1>that's what I try to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try to eat that.</v>

2335
01:54:53.180 --> 01:54:54.470
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's super healthy,</v>

2336
01:54:54.830 --> 01:54:55.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2337
01:54:55.371 --> 01:54:56.150
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the animal,</v>

2338
01:54:56.260 --> 01:54:59.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hasn't been shot up with antibiotics and</v>

2339
01:54:59.211 --> 01:55:01.310
<v Speaker 1>hormones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a natural animal.</v>

2340
01:55:01.400 --> 01:55:05.720
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's living its life in a wild way until</v>

2341
01:55:05.870 --> 01:55:08.980
<v Speaker 1>I dip into the food chain and remove it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's not,</v>

2342
01:55:09.320 --> 01:55:12.560
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it feels good to accomplish it.</v>

2343
01:55:12.640 --> 01:55:16.670
<v Speaker 1>Like the first time I did it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was much more somber than it is now.</v>

2344
01:55:16.671 --> 01:55:18.220
<v Speaker 1>Now it seems like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2345
01:55:18.280 --> 01:55:22.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have sort of accepted what it is and I'm</v>

2346
01:55:22.431 --> 01:55:24.650
<v Speaker 1>a much happier after it's over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

2347
01:55:24.651 --> 01:55:27.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't have this sort of somber </v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling.</v>

2348
01:55:27.170 --> 01:55:30.290
<v Speaker 1>the firsT time it was happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also like,</v>

2349
01:55:30.320 --> 01:55:31.060
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>

2350
01:55:31.250 --> 01:55:33.320
<v Speaker 1>I just took an animal's life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Big animal,</v>

2351
01:55:33.321 --> 01:55:35.840
<v Speaker 1>180 pound deer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this is a lot of,</v>

2352
01:55:36.230 --> 01:55:39.290
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot involved in this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is real.</v>

2353
01:55:39.410 --> 01:55:40.790
<v Speaker 1>But what about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's your position?</v>

2354
01:55:40.970 --> 01:55:43.100
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about conspicuous </v>
<v Speaker 1>consumption and signaling.</v>

2355
01:55:43.350 --> 01:55:45.250
<v Speaker 1>How about trophy hunting?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like that at all.</v>

2356
01:55:45.330 --> 01:55:50.330
<v Speaker 1>I have a real problem with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only Do I have a real problem with </v>

2357
01:55:50.330 --> 01:55:52.701
<v Speaker 1>trophy hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a real problem with what they're </v>

2358
01:55:52.701 --> 01:55:52.701
<v Speaker 1>doing in africa.</v>

2359
01:55:52.701 --> 01:55:57.620
<v Speaker 1>These days is a high fence hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's very strange.</v>

2360
01:55:57.841 --> 01:56:00.780
<v Speaker 1>And here's the contradiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's where it gets weird.</v>

2361
01:56:00.781 --> 01:56:02.760
<v Speaker 1>I had louis theroux.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know who he is?</v>

2362
01:56:02.761 --> 01:56:06.430
<v Speaker 1>The documentary and from england,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure.</v>

2363
01:56:06.640 --> 01:56:11.640
<v Speaker 1>Great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And really fascinating and beautiful </v>

2364
01:56:11.640 --> 01:56:14.400
<v Speaker 1>documentary and he's just a really </v>
<v Speaker 1>wonderful documentaries.</v>

2365
01:56:14.760 --> 01:56:19.760
<v Speaker 1>And he had this one where he went to </v>
<v Speaker 1>this african hunting camp for several </v>

2366
01:56:19.760 --> 01:56:24.470
<v Speaker 1>weeks and stayed there and tried to </v>
<v Speaker 1>really understand what it was all about </v>

2367
01:56:24.470 --> 01:56:24.960
<v Speaker 1>and interviewed all these people and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of them were just despicable.</v>

2368
01:56:25.200 --> 01:56:27.330
<v Speaker 1>They're just these real hickey people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2369
01:56:27.331 --> 01:56:28.180
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just gonna.</v>

2370
01:56:28.560 --> 01:56:29.040
<v Speaker 1>Get her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna.</v>

2371
01:56:29.041 --> 01:56:31.050
<v Speaker 1>Try to get the big five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get a ride home.</v>

2372
01:56:31.051 --> 01:56:36.051
<v Speaker 1>We get an elephant and all they want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do is spend money and bring home tusks </v>

2373
01:56:36.051 --> 01:56:39.621
<v Speaker 1>and horns and all this different shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty gross because it's just </v>

2374
01:56:39.621 --> 01:56:43.370
<v Speaker 1>they're killing to acquire trophies and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're doing is they're killing </v>

2375
01:56:43.370 --> 01:56:44.580
<v Speaker 1>inside these high fences where these </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals,</v>

2376
01:56:44.581 --> 01:56:47.820
<v Speaker 1>it's not like you're out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to.</v>

2377
01:56:47.970 --> 01:56:52.970
<v Speaker 1>And it's not to say that I'm opposed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>high fence hunting because I think if </v>

2378
01:56:52.970 --> 01:56:55.890
<v Speaker 1>you're hunting a deer or an animal that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just going to eat,</v>

2379
01:56:56.490 --> 01:57:01.490
<v Speaker 1>it's essentially a like not that much </v>
<v Speaker 1>different than going to a lake that's </v>

2380
01:57:01.490 --> 01:57:04.110
<v Speaker 1>been stocked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to a lake and they stock</v>

2381
01:57:04.111 --> 01:57:06.590
<v Speaker 1>the lake with trout to ensure that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's fish to fish,</v>

2382
01:57:06.780 --> 01:57:09.600
<v Speaker 1>those fish are not going to get out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that lake and flied in Nebraska.</v>

2383
01:57:09.670 --> 01:57:10.710
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where they live.</v>

2384
01:57:10.860 --> 01:57:13.430
<v Speaker 1>They're stuck there and I don't think </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's any difference between that,</v>

2385
01:57:13.440 --> 01:57:15.930
<v Speaker 1>like these high fence hunting operations</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Texas,</v>

2386
01:57:15.931 --> 01:57:17.250
<v Speaker 1>which I don't have any problem with it </v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

2387
01:57:17.251 --> 01:57:21.630
<v Speaker 1>They have like these thousand acres in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of them I know of is 14,000</v>

2388
01:57:21.631 --> 01:57:25.050
<v Speaker 1>acres and they keep deer on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And why do they have the fences up?</v>

2389
01:57:25.080 --> 01:57:27.100
<v Speaker 1>Well to keep poachers out to keep to.</v>

2390
01:57:27.150 --> 01:57:31.290
<v Speaker 1>And they also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they make a lIving off of guiding people</v>

2391
01:57:31.291 --> 01:57:34.350
<v Speaker 1>to hunt these animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for them it's like the ethical,</v>

2392
01:57:34.780 --> 01:57:37.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>acquiring of have your own meat and it's</v>

2393
01:57:37.891 --> 01:57:39.330
<v Speaker 1>venison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very delicious.</v>

2394
01:57:39.660 --> 01:57:41.310
<v Speaker 1>Tastes good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good for you.</v>

2395
01:57:41.311 --> 01:57:43.410
<v Speaker 1>It's very healthy meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a problem with that.</v>

2396
01:57:43.890 --> 01:57:48.890
<v Speaker 1>With the african thing is so confusing </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there was a woman recently that </v>

2397
01:57:48.890 --> 01:57:52.230
<v Speaker 1>was on the news this past week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was 19 years old.</v>

2398
01:57:52.410 --> 01:57:57.410
<v Speaker 1>She went to africa and took all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>photos with her than with a lion that </v>

2399
01:57:57.410 --> 01:57:58.080
<v Speaker 1>she killed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might have shared that on myself,</v>

2400
01:57:58.110 --> 01:57:58.930
<v Speaker 1>but that wasn't a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who?</v>

2401
01:57:58.931 --> 01:58:01.820
<v Speaker 1>I did one you did recently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was a different one.</v>

2402
01:58:02.930 --> 01:58:06.330
<v Speaker 1>I've followed all your stuff for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2403
01:58:06.331 --> 01:58:07.020
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2404
01:58:07.080 --> 01:58:12.080
<v Speaker 1>you had you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you said it's disgusting and she was </v>

2405
01:58:12.080 --> 01:58:12.350
<v Speaker 1>holding the mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2406
01:58:12.390 --> 01:58:14.970
<v Speaker 1>that's dark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something dark about that man.</v>

2407
01:58:14.970 --> 01:58:16.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're not going to eat that animal.</v>

2408
01:58:16.720 --> 01:58:20.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend is going lion hunting in</v>

2409
01:58:20.101 --> 01:58:22.800
<v Speaker 1>the wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a bowhunters named cameron hanes.</v>

2410
01:58:22.920 --> 01:58:25.200
<v Speaker 1>He's going to eat a lion though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's going to go over there.</v>

2411
01:58:25.201 --> 01:58:26.370
<v Speaker 1>He's going to hunt it in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

2412
01:58:26.450 --> 01:58:27.810
<v Speaker 1>in the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not in the high fence.</v>

2413
01:58:27.990 --> 01:58:30.350
<v Speaker 1>He's going to Zimbabwe and the actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>jungle.</v>

2414
01:58:30.351 --> 01:58:32.160
<v Speaker 1>He's got a hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lion and he's going to eat it.</v>

2415
01:58:32.220 --> 01:58:33.750
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's fucking crazy to,</v>

2416
01:58:33.820 --> 01:58:34.330
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

2417
01:58:34.480 --> 01:58:39.480
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to collect salivary assets from these </v>

2418
01:58:39.480 --> 01:58:39.480
<v Speaker 1>types of guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pre,</v>

2419
01:58:39.480 --> 01:58:40.440
<v Speaker 1>pre,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no post killed.</v>

2420
01:58:40.500 --> 01:58:41.530
<v Speaker 1>But he's got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2421
01:58:41.531 --> 01:58:44.260
<v Speaker 1>testosterone before and after.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2422
01:58:44.290 --> 01:58:46.650
<v Speaker 1>But I guarantee you that it jumps up </v>
<v Speaker 1>when he,</v>

2423
01:58:46.710 --> 01:58:48.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she would say he,</v>

2424
01:58:48.011 --> 01:58:49.940
<v Speaker 1>he's the one who took me bear hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

2425
01:58:50.050 --> 01:58:50.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a,</v>

2426
01:58:51.030 --> 01:58:54.190
<v Speaker 1>he's probably one of the most famous bow</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunters in America today,</v>

2427
01:58:54.191 --> 01:58:55.630
<v Speaker 1>probably in the world actually.</v>

2428
01:58:55.660 --> 01:58:59.050
<v Speaker 1>He's a legit bowhunter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He makes his living doing that.</v>

2429
01:58:59.051 --> 01:59:04.051
<v Speaker 1>And he's a very famous because of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>very ethical though he does not shoot </v>

2430
01:59:04.051 --> 01:59:05.080
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He does not eat everything he shoots.</v>

2431
01:59:05.081 --> 01:59:07.180
<v Speaker 1>He eats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's where,</v>

2432
01:59:07.181 --> 01:59:09.270
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where I have an issue with this,</v>

2433
01:59:09.300 --> 01:59:10.660
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this africa thing.</v>

2434
01:59:10.870 --> 01:59:13.540
<v Speaker 1>But where it gets weird is that those </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals,</v>

2435
01:59:13.541 --> 01:59:15.580
<v Speaker 1>many of them were on the verge of </v>
<v Speaker 1>extinction,</v>

2436
01:59:15.760 --> 01:59:17.950
<v Speaker 1>but now they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're in very high numbers.</v>

2437
01:59:18.160 --> 01:59:20.730
<v Speaker 1>The reason being is that they're in </v>
<v Speaker 1>these events operation.</v>

2438
01:59:20.750 --> 01:59:25.750
<v Speaker 1>So it's such a catch 22.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On one hand they were on the verge of </v>

2439
01:59:25.750 --> 01:59:28.420
<v Speaker 1>extinction and another hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now they have these high populations and</v>

2440
01:59:28.421 --> 01:59:32.290
<v Speaker 1>they're super healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they only exist as a commodity to be</v>

2441
01:59:32.291 --> 01:59:33.940
<v Speaker 1>hunted down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2442
01:59:33.970 --> 01:59:38.970
<v Speaker 1>in the way they're doing it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a waterhole and there's like 100 </v>

2443
01:59:38.970 --> 01:59:40.390
<v Speaker 1>animals in front of waterhole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these people Just sit there and they</v>

2444
01:59:40.400 --> 01:59:42.980
<v Speaker 1>just shoot one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll look what I did on my hun.</v>

2445
01:59:43.240 --> 01:59:44.350
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that even a hunt?</v>

2446
01:59:44.680 --> 01:59:46.090
<v Speaker 1>You're in a park.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2447
01:59:46.091 --> 01:59:49.120
<v Speaker 1>you're in a fenced in for like someone's</v>
<v Speaker 1>yard.</v>

2448
01:59:49.160 --> 01:59:50.140
<v Speaker 1>You're not tracking.</v>

2449
01:59:52.180 --> 01:59:56.080
<v Speaker 1>You're not only not tracking those </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals,</v>

2450
01:59:56.320 --> 02:00:00.550
<v Speaker 1>they're never going to leave and go 100 </v>
<v Speaker 1>miles away to a different place.</v>

2451
02:00:00.551 --> 02:00:01.090
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2452
02:00:01.120 --> 02:00:04.610
<v Speaker 1>go across the river to mule deer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

2453
02:00:04.611 --> 02:00:06.640
<v Speaker 1>they discovered that mule deer in </v>
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>

2454
02:00:06.641 --> 02:00:10.300
<v Speaker 1>This is a really recent discovery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had no idea how far they migrate,</v>

2455
02:00:10.301 --> 02:00:13.900
<v Speaker 1>but they migrate as much as 150 miles in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a year.</v>

2456
02:00:14.140 --> 02:00:19.140
<v Speaker 1>One hundred and 50 miles is a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>walking man for a deer that's like here </v>

2457
02:00:19.140 --> 02:00:21.700
<v Speaker 1>to fucking san diego for a deer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2458
02:00:21.701 --> 02:00:24.880
<v Speaker 1>And they're just starting to understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>their migratory patterns.</v>

2459
02:00:25.270 --> 02:00:27.190
<v Speaker 1>And that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's a wIld animal.</v>

2460
02:00:27.220 --> 02:00:30.010
<v Speaker 1>Now if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I consider a fair chase,</v>

2461
02:00:30.030 --> 02:00:31.210
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go out hunting,</v>

2462
02:00:31.211 --> 02:00:34.270
<v Speaker 1>you find a mule deer that's walking 150 </v>
<v Speaker 1>miles,</v>

2463
02:00:34.271 --> 02:00:36.130
<v Speaker 1>you figured out where they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be and you know,</v>

2464
02:00:36.131 --> 02:00:40.240
<v Speaker 1>and then stalk them and get into a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>position and shoot them and eat them.</v>

2465
02:00:40.510 --> 02:00:45.510
<v Speaker 1>So about as fair and ethical way as you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can acquire your own meat if you're </v>

2466
02:00:45.510 --> 02:00:48.340
<v Speaker 1>going all the way to africa and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not even going to eat that animal.</v>

2467
02:00:48.490 --> 02:00:53.490
<v Speaker 1>And he just kinda like stuff it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stick it on your wall to let everybody </v>

2468
02:00:53.490 --> 02:00:55.120
<v Speaker 1>know how billy bad ass you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's weird man.</v>

2469
02:00:55.210 --> 02:01:00.210
<v Speaker 1>That's weird aspect of human beings that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would even consider that to be a form</v>

2470
02:01:00.281 --> 02:01:01.750
<v Speaker 1>of recreation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2471
02:01:02.020 --> 02:01:02.950
<v Speaker 1>and people go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2472
02:01:02.951 --> 02:01:04.870
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's totally legal and well hey,</v>

2473
02:01:04.871 --> 02:01:05.890
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2474
02:01:05.891 --> 02:01:06.230
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2475
02:01:06.240 --> 02:01:10.600
<v Speaker 1>the money goes to conservation and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>guess it does in a way.</v>

2476
02:01:10.660 --> 02:01:15.660
<v Speaker 1>I guess it does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does go to keep these animals alive </v>

2477
02:01:15.660 --> 02:01:15.660
<v Speaker 1>so they can keep killing them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>

2478
02:01:15.790 --> 02:01:18.700
<v Speaker 1>It's very weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have also a paleo Guy.</v>

2479
02:01:19.300 --> 02:01:20.080
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

2480
02:01:20.081 --> 02:01:24.490
<v Speaker 1>that whole paleo thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like that term paleo because the</v>

2481
02:01:24.491 --> 02:01:29.380
<v Speaker 1>term is been debunked by science and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>talked about like what people did or did</v>

2482
02:01:29.381 --> 02:01:29.980
<v Speaker 1>not eat.</v>

2483
02:01:31.540 --> 02:01:34.570
<v Speaker 1>I think that natural foods are more </v>
<v Speaker 1>easily digestible.</v>

2484
02:01:34.571 --> 02:01:37.270
<v Speaker 1>I try to stay aWay from bread as much as</v>
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>

2485
02:01:37.490 --> 02:01:42.490
<v Speaker 1>Although I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have started eating more sprouted </v>

2486
02:01:42.490 --> 02:01:42.620
<v Speaker 1>bread recently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a csi type bread.</v>

2487
02:01:42.890 --> 02:01:44.990
<v Speaker 1>I feel like my body digest that more </v>
<v Speaker 1>easily.</v>

2488
02:01:44.991 --> 02:01:49.991
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a little healthier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I keep away from white flour and pastas </v>

2489
02:01:49.991 --> 02:01:54.281
<v Speaker 1>and things along those lines and I try </v>
<v Speaker 1>to avoid processed foods as much as </v>

2490
02:01:54.281 --> 02:01:57.260
<v Speaker 1>possible and sugar as much as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in that sense,</v>

2491
02:01:57.261 --> 02:01:58.520
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I eat a lot of vegetables.</v>

2492
02:01:58.521 --> 02:02:00.290
<v Speaker 1>I eat a lot of protein,</v>
<v Speaker 1>animal protein,</v>

2493
02:02:00.291 --> 02:02:04.250
<v Speaker 1>fish and things along those lines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I just think I'm just real.</v>

2494
02:02:04.550 --> 02:02:07.850
<v Speaker 1>I noticed because I work out so much and</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I,</v>

2495
02:02:08.130 --> 02:02:12.830
<v Speaker 1>I do athletics where you sort of measure</v>
<v Speaker 1>your progress,</v>

2496
02:02:13.100 --> 02:02:18.100
<v Speaker 1>whether it's my workout routines like </v>
<v Speaker 1>strength and conditioning routines or </v>

2497
02:02:18.100 --> 02:02:21.370
<v Speaker 1>martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind of see what I'm on and when I'm </v>

2498
02:02:21.370 --> 02:02:24.071
<v Speaker 1>off and I can anecdotally or directly </v>
<v Speaker 1>correlate that between my to my diet and</v>

2499
02:02:24.861 --> 02:02:29.861
<v Speaker 1>I find that when I take supplements and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I make sure that I have plenty of </v>

2500
02:02:29.861 --> 02:02:30.830
<v Speaker 1>vitamins and plenty of green leafy </v>
<v Speaker 1>vegetables,</v>

2501
02:02:30.831 --> 02:02:32.390
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the most important ones I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

2502
02:02:32.630 --> 02:02:33.860
<v Speaker 1>and healthy proteins.</v>

2503
02:02:34.100 --> 02:02:39.100
<v Speaker 1>So in that sense I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I eat along the lines that allow those </v>

2504
02:02:39.100 --> 02:02:39.100
<v Speaker 1>paleo guys eat</v>

2505
02:02:39.100 --> 02:02:39.100
<v Speaker 5>great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2506
02:02:39.100 --> 02:02:39.220
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

2507
02:02:39.280 --> 02:02:41.790
<v Speaker 5>when I used to be a very competitive </v>
<v Speaker 5>soccer player,</v>

2508
02:02:41.791 --> 02:02:45.270
<v Speaker 5>I was grossly underweight my whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean one slash 25,</v>

2509
02:02:45.480 --> 02:02:50.480
<v Speaker 5>30 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 5>four percent body fat just from running </v>

2510
02:02:50.480 --> 02:02:50.480
<v Speaker 5>all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>reading all the time,</v>

2511
02:02:50.480 --> 02:02:52.050
<v Speaker 5>training.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I even found some marathons.</v>

2512
02:02:52.560 --> 02:02:57.560
<v Speaker 5>The day that I stopped training was this</v>
<v Speaker 5>sort of pernicious and insidious weight </v>

2513
02:02:58.291 --> 02:03:00.420
<v Speaker 5>gain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't sort of,</v>

2514
02:03:00.421 --> 02:03:05.421
<v Speaker 5>you saw me one one year,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was 125 in the next year I was one </v>

2515
02:03:05.421 --> 02:03:05.421
<v Speaker 5>eight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was always four,</v>

2516
02:03:05.421 --> 02:03:06.480
<v Speaker 5>five,</v>
<v Speaker 5>eight pounds a year.</v>

2517
02:03:06.660 --> 02:03:07.710
<v Speaker 5>And then one day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>eIght,</v>

2518
02:03:07.711 --> 02:03:09.960
<v Speaker 5>nine years later,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I get on this kid and I'm tipping to 100</v>

2519
02:03:10.500 --> 02:03:13.140
<v Speaker 5>and the most,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got up to fIfty two,</v>

2520
02:03:13.141 --> 02:03:16.020
<v Speaker 5>I'm five foot six,</v>
<v Speaker 5>2:58.</v>

2521
02:03:16.060 --> 02:03:17.760
<v Speaker 5>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're heavyweight.</v>

2522
02:03:18.210 --> 02:03:21.000
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And now I've lost about 25,</v>

2523
02:03:21.001 --> 02:03:21.960
<v Speaker 5>30 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but still,</v>

2524
02:03:21.961 --> 02:03:23.700
<v Speaker 5>even now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I'm over 200 pounds.</v>

2525
02:03:24.030 --> 02:03:27.600
<v Speaker 5>And one of the things that I've,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that I've been doing is,</v>

2526
02:03:27.680 --> 02:03:28.950
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>eating,</v>

2527
02:03:28.980 --> 02:03:33.980
<v Speaker 5>as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of vegetables and a lot of </v>

2528
02:03:33.980 --> 02:03:33.980
<v Speaker 5>protein,</v>
<v Speaker 5>staying away from all the starchy stuff.</v>

2529
02:03:34.020 --> 02:03:37.410
<v Speaker 5>And I'm using my fitness pal.com.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you know this thing,</v>

2530
02:03:37.411 --> 02:03:42.411
<v Speaker 5>this calorie counting program?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's part of this whole quantify </v>

2531
02:03:42.411 --> 02:03:44.480
<v Speaker 5>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So basically my,</v>

2532
02:03:44.850 --> 02:03:46.470
<v Speaker 5>I have to give credit to my wife.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She,</v>

2533
02:03:46.530 --> 02:03:51.530
<v Speaker 5>she literally counts every single </v>
<v Speaker 5>calorie that goes into my body after </v>

2534
02:03:51.530 --> 02:03:54.210
<v Speaker 5>basically 1400 calories in a day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2535
02:03:54.420 --> 02:03:59.420
<v Speaker 5>including exercise and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so as long as I hit 1400 calories </v>

2536
02:03:59.420 --> 02:04:01.770
<v Speaker 5>net that day and I've lost so far,</v>
<v Speaker 5>25 pounds and maybe three months.</v>

2537
02:04:01.950 --> 02:04:03.070
<v Speaker 5>So that's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2538
02:04:03.370 --> 02:04:05.080
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number 25 pounds in three years.</v>

2539
02:04:05.230 --> 02:04:06.400
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2540
02:04:06.401 --> 02:04:08.230
<v Speaker 5>now it's not totally fast too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's good.</v>

2541
02:04:08.231 --> 02:04:08.890
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2542
02:04:08.990 --> 02:04:13.990
<v Speaker 5>I've now it's getting a bit rough.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't seem to break the next sort of </v>

2543
02:04:13.990 --> 02:04:14.350
<v Speaker 5>hump.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What do you do for exercise?</v>

2544
02:04:14.890 --> 02:04:15.610
<v Speaker 5>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

2545
02:04:15.620 --> 02:04:17.380
<v Speaker 5>I'm a cardio guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so maybe,</v>

2546
02:04:17.381 --> 02:04:18.070
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe you'll,</v>

2547
02:04:18.100 --> 02:04:19.810
<v Speaker 5>you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'll guide me in better ways.</v>

2548
02:04:20.080 --> 02:04:25.080
<v Speaker 5>So I just do tons of cardio so it could </v>
<v Speaker 5>be I run on the treadmill or I do </v>

2549
02:04:25.080 --> 02:04:29.311
<v Speaker 5>stationary bike or I do elliptical.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I usually try to average between 45 </v>

2550
02:04:29.311 --> 02:04:29.680
<v Speaker 5>minutes to an hour of cardio.</v>

2551
02:04:29.820 --> 02:04:30.360
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2552
02:04:30.390 --> 02:04:31.740
<v Speaker 1>no doubt about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

2553
02:04:31.741 --> 02:04:36.741
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing better than having a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good gas tank and having a healthy </v>

2554
02:04:36.741 --> 02:04:37.380
<v Speaker 1>heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm one of the things that burns the</v>

2555
02:04:37.381 --> 02:04:40.860
<v Speaker 1>most is muscle and the more muscle that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can put on your body,</v>

2556
02:04:40.861 --> 02:04:44.040
<v Speaker 1>the stronger you can make yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of strange,</v>

2557
02:04:44.041 --> 02:04:45.300
<v Speaker 1>but you get leaner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2558
02:04:45.310 --> 02:04:46.750
<v Speaker 1>Your metabolism goes up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>

2559
02:04:46.780 --> 02:04:48.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I just find,</v>

2560
02:04:48.391 --> 02:04:52.590
<v Speaker 1>I just feel better when I'm stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my body works better.</v>

2561
02:04:52.591 --> 02:04:55.770
<v Speaker 1>I liked the way it feels better and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that I can eat more.</v>

2562
02:04:56.160 --> 02:04:56.700
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2563
02:04:56.710 --> 02:04:58.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm a pig,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like eating,</v>

2564
02:04:58.560 --> 02:05:01.200
<v Speaker 1>but I'm pretty lean for someone who eats</v>
<v Speaker 1>as much as i eat.</v>

2565
02:05:01.480 --> 02:05:03.540
<v Speaker 1>I have you ever seen me eat?</v>
<v Speaker 1>People freak out,</v>

2566
02:05:03.541 --> 02:05:05.330
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially like after comedy shows,</v>

2567
02:05:05.331 --> 02:05:09.510
<v Speaker 1>I'll do like two shows in a night and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll have two entrees and a salad and an</v>

2568
02:05:09.511 --> 02:05:13.200
<v Speaker 1>appetizer to the point where waitresses </v>
<v Speaker 1>think I'm joking and I'm like,</v>

2569
02:05:13.201 --> 02:05:14.280
<v Speaker 1>nope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm serious.</v>

2570
02:05:14.280 --> 02:05:15.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to eat all that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2571
02:05:16.200 --> 02:05:18.030
<v Speaker 1>I eat a lot of food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

2572
02:05:18.090 --> 02:05:23.090
<v Speaker 1>and I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the way I make sure that I stay lean </v>

2573
02:05:23.090 --> 02:05:24.030
<v Speaker 1>is I do a lot of exercise and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>weightlifting.</v>

2574
02:05:24.340 --> 02:05:26.460
<v Speaker 1>I think that weightlifting by weight </v>
<v Speaker 1>lifting,</v>

2575
02:05:26.461 --> 02:05:31.461
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing a lot of the traditional </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff like bench pressing and most of </v>

2576
02:05:31.461 --> 02:05:33.010
<v Speaker 1>the stuff I do is full body exercises,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kettlebells,</v>

2577
02:05:33.030 --> 02:05:35.490
<v Speaker 1>things along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when I do that,</v>

2578
02:05:35.491 --> 02:05:39.630
<v Speaker 1>all that intense strain that's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>available through cardio cardio,</v>

2579
02:05:39.780 --> 02:05:42.540
<v Speaker 1>you could do sprinting and you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>really get your heart rate up and really</v>

2580
02:05:42.541 --> 02:05:47.541
<v Speaker 1>get exhausted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You certainly burn off a lot of </v>

2581
02:05:47.541 --> 02:05:48.310
<v Speaker 1>calories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that intense strain up fucking,</v>

2582
02:05:49.260 --> 02:05:54.260
<v Speaker 1>that's what makes bone density.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what makes your tendons and the </v>

2583
02:05:54.260 --> 02:05:55.460
<v Speaker 1>attendance stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>muscle density strong,</v>

2584
02:05:55.740 --> 02:05:58.290
<v Speaker 1>more thick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that also helps your calorie</v>

2585
02:05:58.291 --> 02:05:59.180
<v Speaker 1>consumption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>

2586
02:05:59.600 --> 02:06:01.220
<v Speaker 5>Speaking of comedians,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just,</v>

2587
02:06:01.520 --> 02:06:06.520
<v Speaker 5>because very organic what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just hired a postdoc who's claim to </v>

2588
02:06:06.681 --> 02:06:11.180
<v Speaker 5>fame so far until he gets into my </v>
<v Speaker 5>research program was he was studying the</v>

2589
02:06:11.181 --> 02:06:14.340
<v Speaker 5>evolutionary roots of humor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2590
02:06:14.360 --> 02:06:19.360
<v Speaker 5>that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so what he basically looked at is </v>

2591
02:06:19.360 --> 02:06:22.040
<v Speaker 5>umer as a sexually select that trait as </v>
<v Speaker 5>a proxy for intelligence.</v>

2592
02:06:22.370 --> 02:06:27.370
<v Speaker 5>And so with his former doctoral </v>
<v Speaker 5>supervisor who's a well known evolution </v>

2593
02:06:27.370 --> 02:06:32.281
<v Speaker 5>psychologists,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they would go into comedy clubs and a </v>

2594
02:06:32.510 --> 02:06:37.400
<v Speaker 5>rate people's impressions of how funny </v>
<v Speaker 5>the comedian is,</v>

2595
02:06:37.580 --> 02:06:42.580
<v Speaker 5>and then we administer iq test to them </v>
<v Speaker 5>and it turns out that funnier people are</v>

2596
02:06:44.751 --> 02:06:47.810
<v Speaker 5>actually smarter people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so when women say,</v>

2597
02:06:48.800 --> 02:06:50.000
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'd love,</v>

2598
02:06:50.120 --> 02:06:50.780
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they always say,</v>

2599
02:06:50.781 --> 02:06:53.450
<v Speaker 5>I want a guy with a sense of humor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want a guy who makes me laugh.</v>

2600
02:06:53.690 --> 02:06:58.690
<v Speaker 5>Whether effectively saying as a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as a proxy measure is I want the guy </v>

2601
02:06:58.690 --> 02:07:00.170
<v Speaker 5>who's intelligence because intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 5>is a heritable trait.</v>

2602
02:07:00.800 --> 02:07:03.560
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I bet that's wrong.</v>

2603
02:07:04.340 --> 02:07:06.610
<v Speaker 1>Here's why that's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know my,</v>

2604
02:07:06.780 --> 02:07:10.040
<v Speaker 1>my favorite comedian of all time is my </v>
<v Speaker 1>friend joey diaz,</v>

2605
02:07:10.190 --> 02:07:12.920
<v Speaker 1>I think he's the funniest guy that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever lived and uh,</v>

2606
02:07:12.990 --> 02:07:16.850
<v Speaker 1>he is a very smart guy as far as like </v>
<v Speaker 1>street smarts,</v>

2607
02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:22.000
<v Speaker 1>wisdom and he knows a lot about life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you gave him a fucking iq test </v>

2608
02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:23.690
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he might barely beat a chimp.</v>

2609
02:07:23.990 --> 02:07:28.990
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think what you're basically saying </v>

2610
02:07:28.990 --> 02:07:29.450
<v Speaker 1>is that iq might not be the way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>measure intelligence,</v>

2611
02:07:29.850 --> 02:07:34.850
<v Speaker 1>but what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you are admitting that he is </v>

2612
02:07:34.850 --> 02:07:34.910
<v Speaker 1>probably very intelligent and he's most </v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly very.</v>

2613
02:07:35.380 --> 02:07:35.990
<v Speaker 1>So then that's</v>

2614
02:07:36.110 --> 02:07:37.760
<v Speaker 3>supporting the general theory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2615
02:07:37.780 --> 02:07:42.780
<v Speaker 3>it's the general theories on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just think that iq intelligence </v>

2616
02:07:42.780 --> 02:07:42.780
<v Speaker 3>doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>your social intelligence.</v>

2617
02:07:43.120 --> 02:07:48.120
<v Speaker 3>He's very socially intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he spots like he's a predator in </v>

2618
02:07:48.120 --> 02:07:52.141
<v Speaker 3>some ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he spots like the weakness the </v>

2619
02:07:52.141 --> 02:07:52.460
<v Speaker 3>person has and is with this motherFucker</v>
<v Speaker 3>with his goofy.</v>

2620
02:07:52.690 --> 02:07:55.900
<v Speaker 3>He'll find out the one thing about you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>

2621
02:07:55.901 --> 02:07:57.220
<v Speaker 3>that's not what you're thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2622
02:07:57.221 --> 02:07:59.380
<v Speaker 3>he'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'll find the one thing that,</v>

2623
02:07:59.381 --> 02:08:01.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're trying to pretend you're not,</v>

2624
02:08:01.241 --> 02:08:06.241
<v Speaker 3>but you truly are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it'll like illuminated like glowing </v>

2625
02:08:06.241 --> 02:08:08.080
<v Speaker 3>thing here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This guy is actually a,</v>

2626
02:08:08.081 --> 02:08:10.470
<v Speaker 3>this is actually have that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's lying about this.</v>

2627
02:08:10.990 --> 02:08:15.990
<v Speaker 3>Most certainly know there's a study that</v>
<v Speaker 3>was done with ceos and the number one </v>

2628
02:08:15.990 --> 02:08:20.671
<v Speaker 3>thing that they all had in common other </v>
<v Speaker 3>than on average being taller than the </v>

2629
02:08:20.671 --> 02:08:22.330
<v Speaker 3>norm ceos and taller than the noise </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

2630
02:08:22.430 --> 02:08:25.260
<v Speaker 3>I fascinated there I think six foot two </v>
<v Speaker 3>or some.</v>

2631
02:08:25.340 --> 02:08:27.760
<v Speaker 3>Some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember exactly the number a is</v>

2632
02:08:27.761 --> 02:08:30.610
<v Speaker 3>that they had very high social </v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligence.</v>

2633
02:08:30.790 --> 02:08:31.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it makes sense.</v>

2634
02:08:31.771 --> 02:08:32.480
<v Speaker 3>It makes sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2635
02:08:32.530 --> 02:08:36.570
<v Speaker 3>If you're an operating officer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're trying to keep everybody in line.</v>

2636
02:08:36.580 --> 02:08:39.220
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of social intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 3>required to do that,</v>

2637
02:08:39.221 --> 02:08:43.410
<v Speaker 3>to manage a giant group of people and </v>
<v Speaker 3>keep everybody happy and you know,</v>

2638
02:08:43.411 --> 02:08:46.900
<v Speaker 3>in foster morale and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot involved in that.</v>

2639
02:08:47.170 --> 02:08:49.330
<v Speaker 3>Here'S an interesting one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A number.</v>

2640
02:08:49.331 --> 02:08:51.030
<v Speaker 3>Earlier we were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2641
02:08:51.220 --> 02:08:56.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how these hollywood types are lying to </v>

2642
02:08:56.220 --> 02:08:56.560
<v Speaker 3>themselves and the privacy of their </v>
<v Speaker 3>bedrooms.</v>

2643
02:08:56.790 --> 02:08:58.120
<v Speaker 3>How we brought that back up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

2644
02:08:58.121 --> 02:09:00.790
<v Speaker 3>there's more to talk about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna like this one.</v>

2645
02:09:01.210 --> 02:09:06.210
<v Speaker 3>So I've often wondered whether they </v>
<v Speaker 3>believe the hype that they say.</v>

2646
02:09:06.251 --> 02:09:09.190
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when somebody is posing in this way,</v>

2647
02:09:09.250 --> 02:09:14.250
<v Speaker 3>do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do they truly kind of internalized this </v>

2648
02:09:14.250 --> 02:09:14.250
<v Speaker 3>or not?</v>

2649
02:09:14.250 --> 02:09:18.750
<v Speaker 3>There's a fantastic evolutionary theory </v>
<v Speaker 3>that looks at the evolutionary roots of </v>

2650
02:09:18.750 --> 02:09:23.101
<v Speaker 3>self deception and other words.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is it that we are so good at self </v>

2651
02:09:23.101 --> 02:09:26.500
<v Speaker 3>deceiving ourselves?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is by a guy named by name of robert</v>

2652
02:09:26.501 --> 02:09:28.170
<v Speaker 3>trevors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>phenomenological biologist,</v>

2653
02:09:28.690 --> 02:09:33.690
<v Speaker 3>and he proposed the theory that I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>is brilliant in its simplicity and then </v>

2654
02:09:33.690 --> 02:09:35.470
<v Speaker 3>what I usually do is to demonstrate the </v>
<v Speaker 3>phenomenon.</v>

2655
02:09:35.471 --> 02:09:40.471
<v Speaker 3>I go to a television shoW like seinfeld </v>
<v Speaker 3>to find a manifestation of that </v>

2656
02:09:40.781 --> 02:09:42.130
<v Speaker 3>phenomenon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I'll talk about In a sec.</v>

2657
02:09:42.880 --> 02:09:47.880
<v Speaker 3>So he says that one of the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 3>dangers that we face as humans is to </v>

2658
02:09:48.641 --> 02:09:51.730
<v Speaker 3>navigate all of these social threats in </v>
<v Speaker 3>our environment.</v>

2659
02:09:51.731 --> 02:09:56.731
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm trying to manipulate you while </v>

2660
02:09:56.731 --> 02:09:58.090
<v Speaker 3>you're trying to read me to see my </v>
<v Speaker 3>manipulative intent.</v>

2661
02:09:58.091 --> 02:10:00.430
<v Speaker 3>That's called machIavellian intelligence</v>
<v Speaker 3>or social intelligence.</v>

2662
02:10:01.120 --> 02:10:06.120
<v Speaker 3>So one of the ways that I could fool you</v>
<v Speaker 3>without you picking up that I am fooling</v>

2663
02:10:06.581 --> 02:10:11.581
<v Speaker 3>you is if any visual cue in my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my face that would signal that I am </v>

2664
02:10:13.361 --> 02:10:16.090
<v Speaker 3>lying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would shut it off the way you,</v>

2665
02:10:16.120 --> 02:10:21.120
<v Speaker 3>because then you can't read that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the way you do that is by deceiving </v>

2666
02:10:21.120 --> 02:10:21.970
<v Speaker 3>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>

2667
02:10:22.510 --> 02:10:24.390
<v Speaker 3>if you understand what I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

2668
02:10:24.870 --> 02:10:27.010
<v Speaker 3>I want to lie to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to deceive you.</v>

2669
02:10:27.011 --> 02:10:32.011
<v Speaker 3>I want to make you do a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you're going to be looking at me to </v>

2670
02:10:32.011 --> 02:10:34.130
<v Speaker 3>see whether there is any visual</v>

2671
02:10:34.130 --> 02:10:39.130
<v Speaker 5>signals that shows that I'm lying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If I could suppress those by first lying</v>

2672
02:10:39.291 --> 02:10:41.840
<v Speaker 5>to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then you can't pick up that online.</v>

2673
02:10:42.330 --> 02:10:47.330
<v Speaker 5>So then,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so there's a show on seinfeld and I </v>

2674
02:10:47.330 --> 02:10:49.371
<v Speaker 5>said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how can I demonstrate this to make a </v>

2675
02:10:49.371 --> 02:10:51.511
<v Speaker 5>sort of more sexy in my book?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there's a short on seinfeld where </v>

2676
02:10:51.511 --> 02:10:53.960
<v Speaker 5>george castanza,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who was kind of the licit,</v>

2677
02:10:53.961 --> 02:10:55.940
<v Speaker 5>this devious guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2678
02:10:55.960 --> 02:11:00.960
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is trying to teach jerry how to be a </v>

2679
02:11:00.960 --> 02:11:04.541
<v Speaker 5>better liar.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And one day as he's about to leave his </v>

2680
02:11:04.541 --> 02:11:04.541
<v Speaker 5>apartment,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he looks at him.</v>

2681
02:11:04.541 --> 02:11:05.090
<v Speaker 5>He Says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>remember jerry,</v>

2682
02:11:05.240 --> 02:11:08.090
<v Speaker 5>it's not a lie if you believe it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I said,</v>

2683
02:11:08.091 --> 02:11:10.760
<v Speaker 5>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's exactly the evolutionary roots of</v>

2684
02:11:10.761 --> 02:11:11.840
<v Speaker 5>self deception.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2685
02:11:12.290 --> 02:11:14.420
<v Speaker 5>So you the evolutionary theories </v>
<v Speaker 5>everywhere,</v>

2686
02:11:14.421 --> 02:11:15.710
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It explains everything.</v>

2687
02:11:15.920 --> 02:11:16.550
<v Speaker 5>I certainly do.</v>

2688
02:11:16.550 --> 02:11:21.550
<v Speaker 1>I think you're correct in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's definitely something </v>

2689
02:11:21.550 --> 02:11:22.270
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can also offer some unique insight</v>

2690
02:11:22.300 --> 02:11:25.150
<v Speaker 1>as to the celebrity thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it what it is,</v>

2691
02:11:25.151 --> 02:11:28.750
<v Speaker 1>because I've been a part of it and I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>also experienced it myself.</v>

2692
02:11:28.810 --> 02:11:32.680
<v Speaker 1>I've experienced mY own self deception </v>
<v Speaker 1>on my own ego swelling,</v>

2693
02:11:32.681 --> 02:11:37.681
<v Speaker 1>like in an unnatural way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because of the environment that </v>

2694
02:11:37.681 --> 02:11:38.740
<v Speaker 1>you're constantly enter the data that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're getting,</v>

2695
02:11:38.741 --> 02:11:40.780
<v Speaker 1>the data that you're getting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're a star.</v>

2696
02:11:41.020 --> 02:11:43.930
<v Speaker 1>I've seen now I'm a nice person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

2697
02:11:43.931 --> 02:11:48.931
<v Speaker 1>I've seen people get shows and become </v>
<v Speaker 1>these fucking ruthless dictators like </v>

2698
02:11:50.351 --> 02:11:54.910
<v Speaker 1>people that have sitcoms or shows that </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolved entirely around them.</v>

2699
02:11:55.150 --> 02:11:57.040
<v Speaker 1>I got like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not seinfeld,</v>

2700
02:11:57.050 --> 02:12:02.050
<v Speaker 1>he's supposedly a very nice guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like there's this famous story of </v>

2701
02:12:02.050 --> 02:12:05.731
<v Speaker 1>brett butler's from that show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grace under fire about what a useless </v>

2702
02:12:05.731 --> 02:12:06.340
<v Speaker 1>monster she became when she was on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

2703
02:12:06.610 --> 02:12:09.070
<v Speaker 1>Granted substance abuse was in there as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2704
02:12:09.700 --> 02:12:11.620
<v Speaker 1>which I think may also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2705
02:12:11.770 --> 02:12:16.770
<v Speaker 1>not just because of the fact that she'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably have addictive tendencies to </v>

2706
02:12:16.770 --> 02:12:20.881
<v Speaker 1>begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of comedians tend to be impulsive </v>

2707
02:12:20.881 --> 02:12:21.430
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of them had tend to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>addiction issues as well.</v>

2708
02:12:21.431 --> 02:12:26.431
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure that played into it as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also the pressure of being the one </v>

2709
02:12:26.431 --> 02:12:31.360
<v Speaker 1>to pressure of being this one person </v>
<v Speaker 1>where when brett butler shows up on the </v>

2710
02:12:31.360 --> 02:12:31.960
<v Speaker 1>set,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone has a coffee for.</v>

2711
02:12:32.140 --> 02:12:33.640
<v Speaker 1>There's a script,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we get anything.</v>

2712
02:12:33.641 --> 02:12:35.770
<v Speaker 1>Bret,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all treading lightly,</v>

2713
02:12:35.771 --> 02:12:38.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all like worried constantly that</v>

2714
02:12:38.081 --> 02:12:40.600
<v Speaker 1>she's going to be upset at them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So their data,</v>

2715
02:12:40.690 --> 02:12:45.460
<v Speaker 1>the data that a person like a brett </v>
<v Speaker 1>butler or some star has is that they are</v>

2716
02:12:45.461 --> 02:12:48.280
<v Speaker 1>special.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all the data they're getting.</v>

2717
02:12:48.670 --> 02:12:51.280
<v Speaker 1>The data,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the data that someone who has,</v>

2718
02:12:51.310 --> 02:12:53.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who's not attractive,</v>

2719
02:12:53.350 --> 02:12:54.970
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're the only data,</v>

2720
02:12:55.030 --> 02:12:59.770
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of data that comes from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>person who is not physically attracted.</v>

2721
02:12:59.770 --> 02:13:00.280
<v Speaker 1>It'S like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2722
02:13:00.700 --> 02:13:03.880
<v Speaker 1>I found out that I can get people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>like me if I make them laugh,</v>

2723
02:13:04.090 --> 02:13:09.090
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to develop a good sense of </v>
<v Speaker 1>humor because my nose isn't getting any </v>

2724
02:13:09.090 --> 02:13:09.430
<v Speaker 1>smaller.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My ears aren't getting any little or I'm</v>

2725
02:13:09.431 --> 02:13:12.160
<v Speaker 1>not getting any taller.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking not losing any weight,</v>

2726
02:13:12.161 --> 02:13:14.260
<v Speaker 1>so let me just do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me just become funny.</v>

2727
02:13:14.261 --> 02:13:19.261
<v Speaker 1>And then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see a lot of funny guys that are my </v>

2728
02:13:19.261 --> 02:13:19.261
<v Speaker 1>friends that are not good looking at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>

2729
02:13:19.261 --> 02:13:21.640
<v Speaker 1>but have beautiful girlfriends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what does that from?</v>

2730
02:13:21.850 --> 02:13:23.620
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they figured out the one thing that they</v>

2731
02:13:23.621 --> 02:13:25.480
<v Speaker 1>do have that they can find that </v>
<v Speaker 1>attractive,</v>

2732
02:13:25.780 --> 02:13:29.500
<v Speaker 1>that data that these actors and these </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that get,</v>

2733
02:13:29.590 --> 02:13:32.100
<v Speaker 1>that are famous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're getting</v>

2734
02:13:32.100 --> 02:13:35.040
<v Speaker 3>love and they're getting love from </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that don't know them.</v>

2735
02:13:35.370 --> 02:13:40.370
<v Speaker 3>They only know their work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They only know this thing that they've </v>

2736
02:13:40.370 --> 02:13:43.851
<v Speaker 3>pretended to be in a movie where there </v>
<v Speaker 3>were a superhero or in this thing where </v>

2737
02:13:43.851 --> 02:13:45.240
<v Speaker 3>they were a doctor and that show where </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were.</v>

2738
02:13:45.420 --> 02:13:50.420
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they always had the right answer and </v>

2739
02:13:50.420 --> 02:13:52.281
<v Speaker 3>they were on top of things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many people that we've seen in </v>

2740
02:13:52.281 --> 02:13:52.281
<v Speaker 3>movies that we thought were like really </v>
<v Speaker 3>smart,</v>

2741
02:13:52.281 --> 02:13:54.210
<v Speaker 3>intelligent people?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you see them in an interview.</v>

2742
02:13:54.211 --> 02:13:54.660
<v Speaker 3>You go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2743
02:13:54.840 --> 02:13:57.060
<v Speaker 3>he's a fucking idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's an idiot.</v>

2744
02:13:57.061 --> 02:14:02.061
<v Speaker 3>He's playing a role right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their data that they get is completely </v>

2745
02:14:02.061 --> 02:14:03.690
<v Speaker 3>unnatural.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That environment Where you,</v>

2746
02:14:04.260 --> 02:14:09.260
<v Speaker 3>for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they decide that you're going to be the </v>

2747
02:14:09.260 --> 02:14:12.231
<v Speaker 3>guy they put you in this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They project you on a screen that's 60 </v>

2748
02:14:12.231 --> 02:14:13.140
<v Speaker 3>feet wide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every time you talk,</v>

2749
02:14:13.380 --> 02:14:18.380
<v Speaker 3>the words that come out of your mouth </v>
<v Speaker 3>were carefully constructed by a team of </v>

2750
02:14:18.380 --> 02:14:20.730
<v Speaker 3>writers and they labored over those </v>
<v Speaker 3>words for weeks and weeks.</v>

2751
02:14:20.940 --> 02:14:25.110
<v Speaker 3>There's music playing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's amazing exhaust,</v>

2752
02:14:25.170 --> 02:14:28.020
<v Speaker 3>so that environment is so completely </v>
<v Speaker 3>unnatural.</v>

2753
02:14:28.021 --> 02:14:31.020
<v Speaker 3>The data that they get because of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>is so unnatural.</v>

2754
02:14:31.021 --> 02:14:35.040
<v Speaker 3>When brad pitt shows up at a some awards</v>
<v Speaker 3>party or something like that and he goes</v>

2755
02:14:35.041 --> 02:14:38.880
<v Speaker 3>down the red carpet and people fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>go bananas and scream,</v>

2756
02:14:39.120 --> 02:14:44.120
<v Speaker 3>he handles it remarkably well for </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone who's in that scenario because </v>

2757
02:14:44.120 --> 02:14:49.041
<v Speaker 3>that is a completely unnatural scenario </v>
<v Speaker 3>and must be insanely difficult to </v>

2758
02:14:49.041 --> 02:14:51.720
<v Speaker 3>maintain objectivity and that's in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>situation.</v>

2759
02:14:51.900 --> 02:14:56.900
<v Speaker 3>So that has to be taken into account.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just the data that those people get is </v>

2760
02:14:56.900 --> 02:15:00.591
<v Speaker 3>so different from the data that a guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>who is working at a camera shop gets a </v>

2761
02:15:00.991 --> 02:15:05.070
<v Speaker 3>guy that was a normal person and normal </v>
<v Speaker 3>life that the data that they get is when</v>

2762
02:15:05.071 --> 02:15:10.071
<v Speaker 3>they interact with people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people judge them based on their </v>

2763
02:15:10.071 --> 02:15:10.071
<v Speaker 3>appearance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how they talk,</v>

2764
02:15:10.140 --> 02:15:11.220
<v Speaker 3>what their background is.</v>

2765
02:15:11.220 --> 02:15:13.350
<v Speaker 3>They start communicating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they gather up data.</v>

2766
02:15:13.650 --> 02:15:18.060
<v Speaker 3>When you see tom cruise or brad pitt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you automatically like them.</v>

2767
02:15:18.330 --> 02:15:23.330
<v Speaker 3>You automatically have all this attached</v>
<v Speaker 3>to them and that's a totally unnatural </v>

2768
02:15:23.330 --> 02:15:25.920
<v Speaker 3>world to live in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is actually some studies that have</v>

2769
02:15:25.921 --> 02:15:30.921
<v Speaker 3>looked at Why is it that people love </v>
<v Speaker 3>celebrities so much and the argument is </v>

2770
02:15:32.580 --> 02:15:36.000
<v Speaker 3>that it's because it's tricking our </v>
<v Speaker 3>ancestral brain,</v>

2771
02:15:36.030 --> 02:15:38.610
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're coming into my television,</v>

2772
02:15:38.710 --> 02:15:43.380
<v Speaker 3>a screen every day on news radio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually,</v>

2773
02:15:43.470 --> 02:15:47.870
<v Speaker 3>you now become part of my what's called,</v>
<v Speaker 3>want dunbar numbers on it for $1,500.</v>

2774
02:15:48.180 --> 02:15:50.280
<v Speaker 3>Very nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know joe rogan.</v>

2775
02:15:50.310 --> 02:15:55.310
<v Speaker 3>I know this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I remember when my kid was </v>

2776
02:15:55.310 --> 02:15:55.310
<v Speaker 3>blogged,</v>
<v Speaker 3>joe rogan,</v>

2777
02:15:55.310 --> 02:15:55.310
<v Speaker 3>joe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>joe.</v>

2778
02:15:55.310 --> 02:15:57.690
<v Speaker 3>I know joe rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I think what ends up happening is</v>

2779
02:15:57.691 --> 02:16:01.080
<v Speaker 3>that since we obviously didn't evolve in</v>
<v Speaker 3>an environment where to televisions,</v>

2780
02:16:01.470 --> 02:16:04.650
<v Speaker 3>but I now feel so intimately connected </v>
<v Speaker 3>to you,</v>

2781
02:16:04.740 --> 02:16:06.330
<v Speaker 3>that barrier is removed.</v>

2782
02:16:06.390 --> 02:16:11.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It gets even weirder when you do </v>

2783
02:16:11.390 --> 02:16:12.921
<v Speaker 3>something like this podcast because it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>even more intimate because we're in </v>

2784
02:16:12.921 --> 02:16:14.730
<v Speaker 3>people's ears were an earbuds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm inside your head.</v>

2785
02:16:14.760 --> 02:16:16.980
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking to you right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you're on a treadmill,</v>

2786
02:16:16.981 --> 02:16:19.980
<v Speaker 3>maybe you're on a plane,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe you're sitting on the subway by my</v>

2787
02:16:19.981 --> 02:16:23.190
<v Speaker 3>books.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's books,</v>

2788
02:16:23.720 --> 02:16:26.130
<v Speaker 3>a member,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those subliminal things that,</v>

2789
02:16:26.131 --> 02:16:28.080
<v Speaker 3>those work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those things like buy popcorn.</v>

2790
02:16:28.110 --> 02:16:30.780
<v Speaker 3>Remember those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>flash in the movie,</v>

2791
02:16:30.800 --> 02:16:34.130
<v Speaker 3>not famous sort of popcorn and coke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Apparently the,</v>

2792
02:16:34.230 --> 02:16:35.500
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know the exact story,</v>

2793
02:16:35.501 --> 02:16:40.330
<v Speaker 3>but I think apparently the company that </v>
<v Speaker 3>commissioned that study,</v>

2794
02:16:40.690 --> 02:16:43.090
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe did some massaging with.</v>

2795
02:16:44.310 --> 02:16:47.830
<v Speaker 3>I had a group of undergraduate students </v>
<v Speaker 3>do a similar project.</v>

2796
02:16:47.831 --> 02:16:51.190
<v Speaker 3>And one of my courses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they found is that if you put,</v>

2797
02:16:51.191 --> 02:16:56.191
<v Speaker 3>let's say by crush or buy a big mac,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not specifically the desire to buy </v>

2798
02:16:56.681 --> 02:16:58.270
<v Speaker 3>that product that increased.</v>

2799
02:16:58.420 --> 02:17:02.150
<v Speaker 3>But rather your hunger and your thirst </v>
<v Speaker 3>increased somewhat.</v>

2800
02:17:02.170 --> 02:17:04.360
<v Speaker 3>I mean it didn't increase your </v>
<v Speaker 3>likelihood of saying,</v>

2801
02:17:04.361 --> 02:17:05.710
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to buy a big mac,</v>

2802
02:17:05.920 --> 02:17:08.230
<v Speaker 3>but when they were asked post the </v>
<v Speaker 3>subliminal thing,</v>

2803
02:17:08.350 --> 02:17:13.350
<v Speaker 3>are you hungry than the subliminal cue </v>
<v Speaker 3>would affect their hunger and their </v>

2804
02:17:13.350 --> 02:17:17.670
<v Speaker 3>thirst but not to the specific product.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the evidence is equivocal,</v>

2805
02:17:18.070 --> 02:17:23.070
<v Speaker 3>so there's a little something in there </v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you see somebody eating a piece </v>

2806
02:17:23.070 --> 02:17:24.510
<v Speaker 3>of cake on tv and it looks awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do that or like that.</v>

2807
02:17:24.900 --> 02:17:25.930
<v Speaker 3>And that's real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2808
02:17:25.990 --> 02:17:30.990
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that is kind of a subliminal message </v>

2809
02:17:30.990 --> 02:17:30.990
<v Speaker 3>or is that not to limit because it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>conscious.</v>

2810
02:17:30.990 --> 02:17:34.780
<v Speaker 3>It's has to be below my conscious </v>
<v Speaker 3>awareness for it to be subliminal.</v>

2811
02:17:35.020 --> 02:17:36.910
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember those things?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They used to sell.</v>

2812
02:17:36.911 --> 02:17:41.911
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they have them anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they used to be cds or audio tapes </v>

2813
02:17:41.911 --> 02:17:45.040
<v Speaker 3>and you would hear like the sound of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>ocean or something like that.</v>

2814
02:17:45.220 --> 02:17:50.220
<v Speaker 3>But then behind the smoking a message </v>
<v Speaker 3>for succession and smoking so well I </v>

2815
02:17:50.861 --> 02:17:53.190
<v Speaker 3>don't know if those work because I don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>think they are on the market anymore.</v>

2816
02:17:53.191 --> 02:17:55.660
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the market has spoken.</v>

2817
02:17:57.010 --> 02:17:57.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were.</v>

2818
02:17:57.750 --> 02:18:00.250
<v Speaker 3>They were quite popular for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You hear like.</v>

2819
02:18:01.100 --> 02:18:01.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2820
02:18:01.600 --> 02:18:02.300
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2821
02:18:03.100 --> 02:18:06.130
<v Speaker 3>Somewhere in there apparently was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lose weight.</v>

2822
02:18:06.160 --> 02:18:07.450
<v Speaker 3>Stop eating cheetos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>

2823
02:18:07.480 --> 02:18:09.820
<v Speaker 3>Why isn't that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't scientology have a similar thing</v>

2824
02:18:09.821 --> 02:18:11.900
<v Speaker 3>with getting the clear state or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something?</v>

2825
02:18:13.690 --> 02:18:16.330
<v Speaker 3>I had a neighbor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was poor bastard.</v>

2826
02:18:16.331 --> 02:18:21.331
<v Speaker 3>There was a piece of property that he </v>
<v Speaker 3>wanted to buy and I found out he was a </v>

2827
02:18:21.331 --> 02:18:24.810
<v Speaker 3>scientologist because this conversation </v>
<v Speaker 3>he wanted to buy this piece of property </v>

2828
02:18:24.810 --> 02:18:24.810
<v Speaker 3>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2829
02:18:24.810 --> 02:18:25.900
<v Speaker 3>this is right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was right next to his house.</v>

2830
02:18:25.901 --> 02:18:28.460
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would you build on it?</v>

2831
02:18:28.461 --> 02:18:29.050
<v Speaker 3>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2832
02:18:29.051 --> 02:18:29.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

2833
02:18:29.770 --> 02:18:32.530
<v Speaker 3>I can't even buy it right now because my</v>
<v Speaker 3>wife was about to go clear,</v>

2834
02:18:33.090 --> 02:18:34.360
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does that mean?</v>

2835
02:18:34.630 --> 02:18:35.710
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know what it meant.</v>

2836
02:18:35.920 --> 02:18:36.640
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2837
02:18:36.641 --> 02:18:37.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were scientologists.</v>

2838
02:18:37.841 --> 02:18:39.130
<v Speaker 3>So and then so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2839
02:18:39.280 --> 02:18:44.280
<v Speaker 3>I tried to be as objective as possible </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that kind of sorta started asking </v>

2840
02:18:44.771 --> 02:18:45.940
<v Speaker 3>them like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does that mean?</v>

2841
02:18:46.300 --> 02:18:51.300
<v Speaker 3>He was telling me that she will no </v>
<v Speaker 3>longer be influenced by any outside </v>

2842
02:18:51.300 --> 02:18:53.200
<v Speaker 3>stimuli,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any outside influence,</v>

2843
02:18:53.201 --> 02:18:58.201
<v Speaker 3>any outside suggestions and that she </v>
<v Speaker 3>will be able to go through this world </v>

2844
02:18:58.201 --> 02:19:02.260
<v Speaker 3>without being affected by negative </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything and anybody yelling at her,</v>

2845
02:19:02.320 --> 02:19:04.810
<v Speaker 3>anybody insulting or they will no longer</v>
<v Speaker 3>get in there,</v>

2846
02:19:05.170 --> 02:19:07.910
<v Speaker 3>but it costs $50,000.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That that's,</v>

2847
02:19:08.040 --> 02:19:09.720
<v Speaker 3>that's the ringer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then remember,</v>

2848
02:19:09.760 --> 02:19:10.900
<v Speaker 3>I was going like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is this?</v>

2849
02:19:10.930 --> 02:19:12.820
<v Speaker 3>What happens?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he was explaining that,</v>

2850
02:19:12.821 --> 02:19:14.770
<v Speaker 3>that she goes through the ceremony and </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2851
02:19:14.771 --> 02:19:17.290
<v Speaker 3>that costs 50 grand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why does it cost us 50 grand?</v>

2852
02:19:17.640 --> 02:19:18.970
<v Speaker 3>So I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

2853
02:19:18.990 --> 02:19:19.630
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2854
02:19:19.840 --> 02:19:23.290
<v Speaker 3>it's worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking poor bastard.</v>

2855
02:19:23.890 --> 02:19:27.070
<v Speaker 3>Now why is it that so many people since </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're in that industry,</v>

2856
02:19:27.410 --> 02:19:28.010
<v Speaker 3>is it that it</v>

2857
02:19:28.010 --> 02:19:32.570
<v Speaker 1>is particularly accepted within the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hollywood crowd crowd question.</v>

2858
02:19:32.780 --> 02:19:36.230
<v Speaker 1>I've only met a few.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've only met a few legit scientologists</v>

2859
02:19:36.231 --> 02:19:40.070
<v Speaker 1>and one thing that they radiate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's this weird sort of positive energy,</v>

2860
02:19:40.430 --> 02:19:45.430
<v Speaker 1>this alien,</v>
<v Speaker 1>artificial positive energy that's very </v>

2861
02:19:45.430 --> 02:19:45.430
<v Speaker 1>difficult to put your finger on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2862
02:19:45.430 --> 02:19:47.270
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nice to meet you man.</v>

2863
02:19:47.271 --> 02:19:52.271
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you deal in evolutionary psychology </v>

2864
02:19:52.271 --> 02:19:55.400
<v Speaker 1>as it applies to marketing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazing stuff.</v>

2865
02:19:55.401 --> 02:19:56.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm like it a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's something.</v>

2866
02:19:57.290 --> 02:20:02.290
<v Speaker 1>It's not like a genuine enthusiasm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's this weird extra level that's not,</v>

2867
02:20:02.691 --> 02:20:06.380
<v Speaker 1>but it's almost like you want to follow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to see how long you can keep this</v>

2868
02:20:06.381 --> 02:20:08.300
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to follow you all day.</v>

2869
02:20:08.450 --> 02:20:10.850
<v Speaker 1>I want to know when the crash is coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2870
02:20:10.851 --> 02:20:12.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure that if I followed you </v>
<v Speaker 1>around,</v>

2871
02:20:12.831 --> 02:20:17.831
<v Speaker 1>I'm just guessing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but based on our two hour and a half </v>

2872
02:20:17.831 --> 02:20:17.831
<v Speaker 1>conversation that if I followed you </v>
<v Speaker 1>around,</v>

2873
02:20:17.831 --> 02:20:18.650
<v Speaker 1>you're pretty much like this all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

2874
02:20:18.660 --> 02:20:23.660
<v Speaker 1>It was you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you're talking to a </v>

2875
02:20:23.660 --> 02:20:25.841
<v Speaker 1>scientologist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fucking know that this is going to </v>

2876
02:20:25.841 --> 02:20:25.841
<v Speaker 1>end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't keep this up man.</v>

2877
02:20:25.850 --> 02:20:28.030
<v Speaker 1>It's like if a guy's putting on a fake </v>
<v Speaker 1>english accent,</v>

2878
02:20:28.040 --> 02:20:30.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking all day like this is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>important time.</v>

2879
02:20:30.640 --> 02:20:33.410
<v Speaker 1>We got to know that I can't do this </v>
<v Speaker 1>forever.</v>

2880
02:20:34.220 --> 02:20:36.470
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is something that they're doing</v>

2881
02:20:36.471 --> 02:20:38.840
<v Speaker 1>when they've got this amazing stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>

2882
02:20:39.110 --> 02:20:40.460
<v Speaker 1>Love what you do in like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2883
02:20:40.461 --> 02:20:41.820
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to hit the rocks brown.</v>

2884
02:20:41.860 --> 02:20:43.760
<v Speaker 1>you're going to crash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something's gonna go wrong.</v>

2885
02:20:44.330 --> 02:20:47.690
<v Speaker 1>But they are there centers that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>have in la,</v>

2886
02:20:47.691 --> 02:20:51.260
<v Speaker 1>one of the most interesting ones is they</v>
<v Speaker 1>have this anti psychiatry,</v>

2887
02:20:51.590 --> 02:20:56.590
<v Speaker 1>anti psychiatry center,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychiatry kills and they have this big </v>

2888
02:20:56.590 --> 02:20:59.090
<v Speaker 1>billboard where the guy's got like shock</v>
<v Speaker 1>electric shock therapy,</v>

2889
02:20:59.091 --> 02:21:01.400
<v Speaker 1>shit on his head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>screaming in agony.</v>

2890
02:21:01.760 --> 02:21:06.760
<v Speaker 1>And what you don't realize when you go </v>
<v Speaker 1>to that is that it's a scientology </v>

2891
02:21:06.760 --> 02:21:06.760
<v Speaker 1>front.</v>

2892
02:21:06.760 --> 02:21:08.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd go in there and they,</v>

2893
02:21:08.091 --> 02:21:08.750
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2894
02:21:08.751 --> 02:21:11.280
<v Speaker 1>they get you hooked on dianetics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2895
02:21:12.040 --> 02:21:16.310
<v Speaker 1>The story of this guy is quite amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's amazing,</v>

2896
02:21:16.670 --> 02:21:17.990
<v Speaker 1>amazingly bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

2897
02:21:17.991 --> 02:21:22.991
<v Speaker 1>Amazingly bad writer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that he openly spoke about </v>

2898
02:21:22.991 --> 02:21:27.251
<v Speaker 1>creating your own religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you want to have real power and </v>

2899
02:21:27.251 --> 02:21:27.251
<v Speaker 1>real money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to make your own religion.</v>

2900
02:21:27.251 --> 02:21:31.760
<v Speaker 1>And then made his own religion and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>books are fucking atrocious.</v>

2901
02:21:32.060 --> 02:21:34.010
<v Speaker 1>His movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>battlefield earth.</v>

2902
02:21:34.011 --> 02:21:35.480
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen the john travolta </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie?</v>

2903
02:21:35.500 --> 02:21:36.380
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my god.</v>

2904
02:21:36.381 --> 02:21:41.381
<v Speaker 1>We were talking about it last week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My friend elizA slessinger and I were </v>

2905
02:21:41.381 --> 02:21:44.651
<v Speaker 1>laughing about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a insanely bad movie with john </v>

2906
02:21:44.651 --> 02:21:49.511
<v Speaker 1>travolta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's in more of a monster giant alien </v>

2907
02:21:49.511 --> 02:21:50.620
<v Speaker 1>guy and it's him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

2908
02:21:50.900 --> 02:21:53.600
<v Speaker 1>what's the fucking dudes name with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>lazy eye?</v>

2909
02:21:53.601 --> 02:21:57.050
<v Speaker 1>The black guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a forest whitaker,</v>

2910
02:21:57.180 --> 02:21:58.650
<v Speaker 1>forest forest whitaker's in it too.</v>

2911
02:21:59.880 --> 02:22:01.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he's the scientologists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's,</v>

2912
02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:07.000
<v Speaker 1>he's an alien the in this movie because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be amazed at how many </v>

2913
02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:09.911
<v Speaker 1>scientologists there are high level </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and you start like looking like </v>

2914
02:22:10.070 --> 02:22:15.070
<v Speaker 1>weird ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like back the singer back is this </v>

2915
02:22:15.070 --> 02:22:18.460
<v Speaker 1>juliette lewis is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you go down the list of people that </v>

2916
02:22:18.460 --> 02:22:20.270
<v Speaker 1>are actual scientologists is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty extensive.</v>

2917
02:22:20.540 --> 02:22:25.340
<v Speaker 1>I think what it provides them is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>scaffolding for,</v>

2918
02:22:25.800 --> 02:22:30.240
<v Speaker 1>I think hollywood and the idea of being </v>
<v Speaker 1>and most notably actors,</v>

2919
02:22:30.330 --> 02:22:33.840
<v Speaker 1>because acting itself is one of the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>unstable professions.</v>

2920
02:22:34.230 --> 02:22:35.740
<v Speaker 1>You have to be chosen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could you.</v>

2921
02:22:35.741 --> 02:22:40.741
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you do is based entirely on the </v>

2922
02:22:40.741 --> 02:22:42.270
<v Speaker 1>merits of your work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you do is based on entirely on your</v>

2923
02:22:42.271 --> 02:22:44.730
<v Speaker 1>education,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your qualifications,</v>

2924
02:22:44.760 --> 02:22:45.030
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

2925
02:22:45.130 --> 02:22:50.130
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the data that you've provided and </v>

2926
02:22:50.130 --> 02:22:50.130
<v Speaker 1>the writing that you've done based on </v>
<v Speaker 1>that data.</v>

2927
02:22:50.130 --> 02:22:51.450
<v Speaker 1>It's all really rock solid stuff.</v>

2928
02:22:51.780 --> 02:22:56.780
<v Speaker 1>So I'll right in front of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite the fact that the ideologues </v>

2929
02:22:56.780 --> 02:22:59.400
<v Speaker 1>attack you and the fucking politically </v>
<v Speaker 1>correct knuckleheads will go after you.</v>

2930
02:22:59.850 --> 02:23:01.440
<v Speaker 1>What you're doing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2931
02:23:01.441 --> 02:23:02.940
<v Speaker 1>it's all based on the merits of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

2932
02:23:02.970 --> 02:23:07.970
<v Speaker 1>What an actor is doing is trying so </v>
<v Speaker 1>desperately to get other people to </v>

2933
02:23:08.251 --> 02:23:11.380
<v Speaker 1>accept them and choose them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's very weird.</v>

2934
02:23:12.280 --> 02:23:14.490
<v Speaker 1>It's fleeting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just fleeting,</v>

2935
02:23:14.520 --> 02:23:17.100
<v Speaker 1>it's so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so weird that they don't have their</v>

2936
02:23:17.101 --> 02:23:22.101
<v Speaker 1>own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very rare that you talk to actors </v>

2937
02:23:22.101 --> 02:23:22.101
<v Speaker 1>and they have their own opinions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2938
02:23:22.101 --> 02:23:25.340
<v Speaker 1>It's like what they have is this sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>conglomeration of opinions that they've </v>

2939
02:23:25.340 --> 02:23:28.860
<v Speaker 1>sort of subscribe to because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe that this is going to ingratiate</v>

2940
02:23:28.861 --> 02:23:30.900
<v Speaker 1>them with the overlords of hollywood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2941
02:23:31.230 --> 02:23:33.270
<v Speaker 1>So everyone has got damn politically </v>
<v Speaker 1>correct.</v>

2942
02:23:33.271 --> 02:23:36.390
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's driving a fucking prius,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's voting democrat.</v>

2943
02:23:36.650 --> 02:23:41.650
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone is wearing pink ribbons when </v>

2944
02:23:41.650 --> 02:23:41.650
<v Speaker 1>it's the appropriate time because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>breast cancer awareness.</v>

2945
02:23:41.760 --> 02:23:43.790
<v Speaker 1>Hashtag bring our girls home.</v>

2946
02:23:45.930 --> 02:23:47.190
<v Speaker 1>Hashtag yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All Women.</v>

2947
02:23:47.191 --> 02:23:49.740
<v Speaker 1>You better fucking have that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You better have a good quote about it.</v>

2948
02:23:49.980 --> 02:23:53.040
<v Speaker 1>Hashtag hashtag go fuck yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they all,</v>

2949
02:23:53.460 --> 02:23:58.460
<v Speaker 1>they all get up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They become a part of this sort of </v>

2950
02:23:58.460 --> 02:24:01.520
<v Speaker 1>really unstable and to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be fame fair to someone who wants to </v>

2951
02:24:02.041 --> 02:24:05.880
<v Speaker 1>be an actor in the first place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oftentimes you're incredibly unstable at</v>

2952
02:24:05.881 --> 02:24:06.460
<v Speaker 1>first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2953
02:24:06.990 --> 02:24:09.330
<v Speaker 1>the original you before you get to </v>
<v Speaker 1>hollywood,</v>

2954
02:24:09.331 --> 02:24:10.530
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do you want to be an actor?</v>

2955
02:24:10.531 --> 02:24:13.710
<v Speaker 1>Because you want to be super special,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just regular special.</v>

2956
02:24:13.711 --> 02:24:15.840
<v Speaker 1>You want to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to be the guy.</v>

2957
02:24:15.910 --> 02:24:20.910
<v Speaker 1>I actually wanted to ask you about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>because my theory is that very few </v>

2958
02:24:20.910 --> 02:24:24.240
<v Speaker 1>actors want to be actors because of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>love of the craft.</v>

2959
02:24:24.300 --> 02:24:24.690
<v Speaker 1>I Mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

2960
02:24:24.691 --> 02:24:28.140
<v Speaker 1>there's opera opportunity and robert </v>
<v Speaker 1>deniro who really do this because,</v>

2961
02:24:28.141 --> 02:24:28.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just,</v>

2962
02:24:28.771 --> 02:24:33.771
<v Speaker 1>they're real artists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most people are really looking for </v>

2963
02:24:33.771 --> 02:24:33.771
<v Speaker 1>the extrinsic brooks.</v>

2964
02:24:33.771 --> 02:24:38.030
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really cool for me to walk around </v>

2965
02:24:38.030 --> 02:24:38.030
<v Speaker 1>and people throwing themselves off </v>
<v Speaker 1>balconies when I,</v>

2966
02:24:38.030 --> 02:24:38.760
<v Speaker 1>when I make an appearance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2967
02:24:38.840 --> 02:24:39.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To make tons of money.</v>

2968
02:24:39.930 --> 02:24:42.120
<v Speaker 1>So would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would you agree that that's true?</v>

2969
02:24:42.121 --> 02:24:43.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that it's a sickness.</v>

2970
02:24:43.951 --> 02:24:44.400
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2971
02:24:44.401 --> 02:24:44.750
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2972
02:24:44.751 --> 02:24:47.740
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people they see like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy like uh,</v>

2973
02:24:48.090 --> 02:24:51.300
<v Speaker 1>go back to brad pitt for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they see the love that brad pitt gets.</v>

2974
02:24:51.301 --> 02:24:56.301
<v Speaker 1>They want to be like him and what's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>best way to be like him to do what he </v>

2975
02:24:56.301 --> 02:24:56.340
<v Speaker 1>does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what does he do?</v>

2976
02:24:56.530 --> 02:24:57.720
<v Speaker 1>He acts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How hard is that?</v>

2977
02:24:57.721 --> 02:24:59.310
<v Speaker 1>It's just Pretending I'm going to get an</v>
<v Speaker 1>acting,</v>

2978
02:24:59.590 --> 02:25:00.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just want,</v>

2979
02:25:01.110 --> 02:25:03.720
<v Speaker 1>they have a hole in their soul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They need to fill up with other people's</v>

2980
02:25:03.721 --> 02:25:07.380
<v Speaker 1>attention and almost all of them that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are like really extremely successful had</v>

2981
02:25:07.381 --> 02:25:09.180
<v Speaker 1>some fucking wacky childhood.</v>

2982
02:25:09.420 --> 02:25:11.760
<v Speaker 1>For me personally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a very bad childhood.</v>

2983
02:25:11.830 --> 02:25:13.270
<v Speaker 1>It was not good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2984
02:25:13.290 --> 02:25:16.110
<v Speaker 1>and because of that bad child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't the worst.</v>

2985
02:25:16.111 --> 02:25:17.760
<v Speaker 1>I have friends that have way worse </v>
<v Speaker 1>childhoods,</v>

2986
02:25:17.761 --> 02:25:22.761
<v Speaker 1>but it was enough to create a deficit </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I had this burning desire to fill </v>

2987
02:25:22.990 --> 02:25:24.910
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to show that I wasn't a loser.</v>

2988
02:25:25.110 --> 02:25:25.450
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2989
02:25:25.510 --> 02:25:27.130
<v Speaker 1>there wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there wasn't this,</v>

2990
02:25:27.500 --> 02:25:32.500
<v Speaker 1>this child who is ignored and treated </v>
<v Speaker 1>like shit that I wasn't that,</v>

2991
02:25:33.190 --> 02:25:34.700
<v Speaker 1>that I'll show you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2992
02:25:34.701 --> 02:25:39.430
<v Speaker 1>and that I'll show you is what sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting fame by becoming or being graded</v>

2993
02:25:39.431 --> 02:25:44.431
<v Speaker 1>athletics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's what initially led me to </v>

2994
02:25:44.431 --> 02:25:44.431
<v Speaker 1>fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what initially led me to comedy.</v>

2995
02:25:44.440 --> 02:25:49.440
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't as much I'll get fame is I'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>show you like I'm going to get great at </v>

2996
02:25:49.440 --> 02:25:54.361
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then somewhere along the line I </v>

2997
02:25:54.361 --> 02:25:54.361
<v Speaker 1>started acting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>

2998
02:25:54.361 --> 02:25:54.361
<v Speaker 1>But that was completely by accident.</v>

2999
02:25:54.630 --> 02:25:55.360
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never,</v>

3000
02:25:55.780 --> 02:26:00.780
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never taken any acting classes or </v>

3001
02:26:00.780 --> 02:26:01.000
<v Speaker 1>anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just got a development deal because of</v>

3002
02:26:01.001 --> 02:26:06.001
<v Speaker 1>standup comedy and I took a handful of </v>
<v Speaker 1>private one-on-one acting classes with a</v>

3003
02:26:06.941 --> 02:26:08.530
<v Speaker 1>crazy person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3004
02:26:08.531 --> 02:26:12.520
<v Speaker 1>This crazy lady who was constantly </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to get me to.</v>

3005
02:26:12.700 --> 02:26:17.500
<v Speaker 1>If I did get a show to cast her as my </v>
<v Speaker 1>mother working her way in.</v>

3006
02:26:17.560 --> 02:26:18.790
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so gross.</v>

3007
02:26:19.380 --> 02:26:23.350
<v Speaker 1>She conversations that I had with this </v>
<v Speaker 1>lady was so brutal and it sort of like,</v>

3008
02:26:23.440 --> 02:26:27.130
<v Speaker 1>it was one of the first interactions </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I had ever had with someone who has</v>

3009
02:26:27.430 --> 02:26:32.430
<v Speaker 1>deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deep in the acting world and the </v>

3010
02:26:32.430 --> 02:26:34.231
<v Speaker 1>business and I got to be around some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these people that were also taking her </v>

3011
02:26:34.231 --> 02:26:34.231
<v Speaker 1>classes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3012
02:26:34.231 --> 02:26:38.480
<v Speaker 1>you people are fucking grills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something gross about the just </v>

3013
02:26:38.480 --> 02:26:41.120
<v Speaker 1>the disingenuous behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3014
02:26:41.350 --> 02:26:42.160
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

3015
02:26:42.161 --> 02:26:47.161
<v Speaker 1>as we said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it all boils down to like what </v>

3016
02:26:47.161 --> 02:26:47.161
<v Speaker 1>is that world?</v>

3017
02:26:47.161 --> 02:26:51.120
<v Speaker 1>So are many of your personal friends in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the industry or are they more in </v>

3018
02:26:51.120 --> 02:26:52.480
<v Speaker 1>fighting or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of them are comedians.</v>

3019
02:26:52.510 --> 02:26:57.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm mostly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My good friends are stand up comics </v>

3020
02:26:57.510 --> 02:26:58.000
<v Speaker 1>because standup comics is like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the other ones are martial artists.</v>

3021
02:26:58.060 --> 02:27:03.060
<v Speaker 1>Those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those two worlds are there as solid as </v>

3022
02:27:03.060 --> 02:27:03.060
<v Speaker 1>he can get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're not funny,</v>

3023
02:27:03.060 --> 02:27:04.900
<v Speaker 1>no one laughs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't know how to fight,</v>

3024
02:27:04.901 --> 02:27:06.530
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get your ass kicked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you.</v>

3025
02:27:06.740 --> 02:27:08.530
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you don't know,</v>

3026
02:27:08.620 --> 02:27:10.510
<v Speaker 1>if you don't know jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's going to strangle you.</v>

3027
02:27:10.820 --> 02:27:11.530
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3028
02:27:11.560 --> 02:27:16.560
<v Speaker 1>these were all rock solid world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no no getting around them where </v>

3029
02:27:16.560 --> 02:27:20.101
<v Speaker 1>things get weird and airy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fairy is when you're pretending to be a </v>

3030
02:27:20.101 --> 02:27:20.200
<v Speaker 1>superhero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3031
02:27:20.201 --> 02:27:22.590
<v Speaker 1>or you're pretending to be a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just think it's a.</v>

3032
02:27:22.660 --> 02:27:27.660
<v Speaker 1>It's an unnatural position to be in and </v>
<v Speaker 1>for human beings as you were saying,</v>

3033
02:27:28.390 --> 02:27:32.900
<v Speaker 1>we have this evolutionary trait where we</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at successful behavior.</v>

3034
02:27:32.900 --> 02:27:34.030
<v Speaker 1>We want to emulate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3035
02:27:34.031 --> 02:27:35.860
<v Speaker 1>if you find the guy who's the head of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the tribe,</v>

3036
02:27:36.130 --> 02:27:41.130
<v Speaker 1>who's got the scars and the wisdom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the guy that you want to pay </v>

3037
02:27:41.130 --> 02:27:44.881
<v Speaker 1>attention to because you can learn from </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people's mistakes and he shows </v>

3038
02:27:44.881 --> 02:27:45.610
<v Speaker 1>wisdom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can emulate his behavior and you can</v>

3039
02:27:45.611 --> 02:27:47.020
<v Speaker 1>become successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3040
02:27:47.080 --> 02:27:52.060
<v Speaker 1>when someone is on tv and slash or in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie theater in their heads for 60 feet</v>

3041
02:27:52.120 --> 02:27:54.610
<v Speaker 1>tall and they're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything they're saying is perfect,</v>

3042
02:27:54.910 --> 02:27:56.650
<v Speaker 1>you want to be them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3043
02:27:56.651 --> 02:28:01.651
<v Speaker 1>you want to follow them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to worship them because they </v>

3044
02:28:01.651 --> 02:28:02.890
<v Speaker 1>seem to be exhibiting this evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

3045
02:28:02.891 --> 02:28:07.891
<v Speaker 1>And also think that the media itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's music or whether it's </v>

3046
02:28:07.891 --> 02:28:09.330
<v Speaker 1>movies and television,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

3047
02:28:09.790 --> 02:28:14.790
<v Speaker 1>there's an inescapable quality to being </v>
<v Speaker 1>on film that is unavoidable and some </v>

3048
02:28:16.631 --> 02:28:21.010
<v Speaker 1>very strange way and that your body's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not designed to absorb.</v>

3049
02:28:21.770 --> 02:28:24.080
<v Speaker 1>Your body is not designed to absorb </v>
<v Speaker 1>movies.</v>

3050
02:28:24.081 --> 02:28:29.081
<v Speaker 1>Your body's absorbed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>designed to absorb the wisdom of the </v>

3051
02:28:29.081 --> 02:28:29.270
<v Speaker 1>natural world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the wisdom of,</v>

3052
02:28:29.450 --> 02:28:34.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy got bitten by a is to have the </v>

3053
02:28:34.450 --> 02:28:34.450
<v Speaker 1>tall grass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3054
02:28:34.450 --> 02:28:34.450
<v Speaker 1>it's real fucking simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3055
02:28:34.450 --> 02:28:34.450
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3056
02:28:34.450 --> 02:28:36.530
<v Speaker 1>he went in the river and he drowned or </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't go in the river.</v>

3057
02:28:36.740 --> 02:28:41.740
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these lessons we learned from the </v>

3058
02:28:41.740 --> 02:28:43.811
<v Speaker 1>natural world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All these things that we see that exist </v>

3059
02:28:43.811 --> 02:28:44.630
<v Speaker 1>in the material world that's in front of</v>
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>

3060
02:28:44.840 --> 02:28:49.840
<v Speaker 1>But when this world is all of a sudden </v>
<v Speaker 1>been changed and now you're looking at </v>

3061
02:28:49.840 --> 02:28:54.041
<v Speaker 1>dragons and you're looking at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>spaceships and fucking lightning bolts </v>

3062
02:28:54.041 --> 02:28:56.420
<v Speaker 1>and all these things that are taking </v>
<v Speaker 1>place on a screen that aren't real,</v>

3063
02:28:56.630 --> 02:28:59.240
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing gets very squirrely in </v>
<v Speaker 1>our minds.</v>

3064
02:28:59.270 --> 02:29:03.380
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what to do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So do you ever get blow backs?</v>

3065
02:29:03.380 --> 02:29:04.820
<v Speaker 1>As we were talking about blowback about </v>
<v Speaker 1>being,</v>

3066
02:29:05.200 --> 02:29:10.200
<v Speaker 1>you get blowback from people in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>industry for speaking so critically of </v>

3067
02:29:10.200 --> 02:29:11.510
<v Speaker 1>the hollywood types.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're scared,</v>

3068
02:29:11.630 --> 02:29:16.630
<v Speaker 1>especially actors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrified to have an opinion on </v>

3069
02:29:16.630 --> 02:29:19.121
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They opinion on someone shitting on </v>

3070
02:29:19.121 --> 02:29:19.440
<v Speaker 1>actors because the problem is then it </v>

<v Speaker 1>years that she's famous.</v>

3086
02:29:56.330 --> 02:29:59.480
<v Speaker 1>She seems completely unaffected by </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever mechanism.</v>

3087
02:29:59.481 --> 02:30:02.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how she got to fake modest.</v>

<v Speaker 1>group of islamic people.</v>

3149
02:32:40.560 --> 02:32:45.560

<v Speaker 1>between what people think of them as </v>

3150
02:32:45.560 --> 02:32:48.320

<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

3152
02:32:49.891 --> 02:32:53.880
<v Speaker 1>how many of you believe in the works of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the koran,</v>

3153
02:32:53.940 --> 02:32:57.150
<v Speaker 1>in the word of the koran,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in how many of you follow it?</v>

3154
02:32:57.151 --> 02:33:01.410

<v Speaker 1>How many of you believe that the word of</v>

3155
02:33:01.411 --> 02:33:06.411
<v Speaker 1>god is the best way to deal with </v>
<v Speaker 1>homosexuals and that whatever the koran </v>

3156
02:33:07.381 --> 02:33:12.381
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether they it says they should be </v>

3157
02:33:12.381 --> 02:33:12.381
<v Speaker 1>stoned to death,</v>

<v Speaker 1>the.</v>

3159
02:33:12.381 --> 02:33:17.250
<v Speaker 1>And they don't raise their hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like he goes into this thing about </v>

3160
02:33:17.250 --> 02:33:19.290
<v Speaker 1>how many of you think that women should </v>
<v Speaker 1>be silent and then they should.</v>

3161
02:33:19.340 --> 02:33:22.320
<v Speaker 1>You should listen to their man because </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what god has said.</v>

3162
02:33:22.321 --> 02:33:23.640
<v Speaker 1>And they all raised their hand and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3163
02:33:23.641 --> 02:33:24.270
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

3164
02:33:24.480 --> 02:33:27.240
<v Speaker 1>this is not radical islam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is just islam.</v>

3165
02:33:27.241 --> 02:33:29.040
<v Speaker 1>So all these people that say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3166
02:33:29.100 --> 02:33:30.720
<v Speaker 1>is so radical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the radical islam.</v>

3167
02:33:30.960 --> 02:33:35.640
<v Speaker 1>And like he doesn't even realize that </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's demonstrating radical islam.</v>

3168
02:33:35.690 --> 02:33:40.690
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's demonstrating sam harris got so </v>

3169
02:33:40.690 --> 02:33:41.160
<v Speaker 1>much fucking hate just for putting this </v>
<v Speaker 1>video up.</v>

3170
02:33:41.570 --> 02:33:42.630
<v Speaker 1>I saw all these people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3171
02:33:42.631 --> 02:33:44.300
<v Speaker 1>I see what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shielding your,</v>

3172
02:33:44.301 --> 02:33:48.380
<v Speaker 1>his islamophobic with one person and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's your islamophobia.</v>

3173
02:33:48.381 --> 02:33:48.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3174
02:33:48.630 --> 02:33:50.510
<v Speaker 5>What's astonishing is that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

3175
02:33:50.550 --> 02:33:52.730
<v Speaker 5>he is a true liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

3176
02:33:52.790 --> 02:33:56.390
<v Speaker 5>And yet he is painted to be some hate </v>
<v Speaker 5>monger.</v>

3177
02:33:56.750 --> 02:34:01.750
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he also gets painted that way because </v>

3178
02:34:01.750 --> 02:34:02.690
<v Speaker 1>it's perceived that he supports war </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he wants to,</v>

3179
02:34:03.100 --> 02:34:06.410
<v Speaker 1>to suppress this aspect of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of humanity.</v>

3180
02:34:06.411 --> 02:34:07.360
<v Speaker 1>And why is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3181
02:34:07.361 --> 02:34:09.780
<v Speaker 1>it's because it's not over here yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it was over here,</v>

3182
02:34:09.810 --> 02:34:13.460
<v Speaker 1>it was invading and you were getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>suicide bombs on a daily basis,</v>

3183
02:34:13.461 --> 02:34:14.810
<v Speaker 1>you would have a real issue with it too.</v>

3184
02:34:14.950 --> 02:34:16.900
<v Speaker 5>I'll tell you a great story.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3185
02:34:17.200 --> 02:34:21.040
<v Speaker 5>those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A woman approached me who was used to be</v>

3186
02:34:21.041 --> 02:34:22.840
<v Speaker 5>a friend.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now she no longer is a friend.</v>

3187
02:34:23.480 --> 02:34:25.810
<v Speaker 5>You'll know by the end of the story why </v>
<v Speaker 5>she said,</v>

3188
02:34:25.850 --> 02:34:27.280
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know a lot about this issue.</v>

3189
02:34:27.281 --> 02:34:28.630
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you grew up in the region.</v>

3190
02:34:28.890 --> 02:34:33.890
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what is the position on islam regarding </v>

3191
02:34:33.890 --> 02:34:33.890
<v Speaker 5>jews?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3192
02:34:33.890 --> 02:34:38.130
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean we escaped Lebanon because we </v>

3193
02:34:38.130 --> 02:34:38.130
<v Speaker 5>were going to be executed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

3194
02:34:38.130 --> 02:34:39.130
<v Speaker 5>bye.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't by the amish.</v>

3195
02:34:39.180 --> 02:34:40.360
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3196
02:34:40.361 --> 02:34:41.170
<v Speaker 5>so I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what,</v>

3197
02:34:41.200 --> 02:34:43.120
<v Speaker 5>rather than kind of go into a whole </v>
<v Speaker 5>treaties,</v>

3198
02:34:43.121 --> 02:34:47.080
<v Speaker 5>here's what I'm going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to share with you a montage of</v>

3199
02:34:47.130 --> 02:34:50.290
<v Speaker 5>a moms from around the world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So this is not the culture specific.</v>

3200
02:34:50.291 --> 02:34:52.500
<v Speaker 5>There's the indonesian and malaysian,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Kuwait,</v>

3201
02:34:52.501 --> 02:34:55.540
<v Speaker 5>the yemeni.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So these are at their sermons.</v>

3202
02:34:55.541 --> 02:35:00.541
<v Speaker 5>This is at the mosque where they are </v>
<v Speaker 5>preaching what should be done to the </v>

3203
02:35:00.541 --> 02:35:00.541
<v Speaker 5>jews.</v>

3204
02:35:00.550 --> 02:35:02.660
<v Speaker 5>And one of the particular,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3205
02:35:03.030 --> 02:35:08.030
<v Speaker 5>iSlam's was showing images of the nazis </v>
<v Speaker 5>bulldozing a skeleton's into the ditches</v>

3206
02:35:09.820 --> 02:35:11.680
<v Speaker 5>and he was lamenting to god,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why?</v>

3207
02:35:11.681 --> 02:35:16.681
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why didn't you give us the pleasure of </v>

3208
02:35:16.681 --> 02:35:17.860
<v Speaker 5>exterminating those jewish routes?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why do you hate us so much?</v>

3209
02:35:17.861 --> 02:35:20.470
<v Speaker 5>Jewish rats have some version of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

3210
02:35:20.620 --> 02:35:23.170
<v Speaker 5>So maybe it was even by that standard </v>
<v Speaker 5>was diabolical.</v>

3211
02:35:23.171 --> 02:35:28.171
<v Speaker 5>So I share with her the link and I make,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I made absolutely no interpretation is </v>

3212
02:35:28.171 --> 02:35:28.570
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wasn't saying it's good,</v>

3213
02:35:28.571 --> 02:35:30.250
<v Speaker 5>it's bad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just shared the link.</v>

3214
02:35:30.910 --> 02:35:35.910
<v Speaker 5>Now she's a jewish woman whose </v>
<v Speaker 5>grandparents I can't remember on which </v>

3215
02:35:35.910 --> 02:35:39.661
<v Speaker 5>side had had suffered in the holocaust.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She her response back to me,</v>

3216
02:35:40.030 --> 02:35:42.670
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in you sharing this video,</v>

3217
02:35:42.760 --> 02:35:47.760
<v Speaker 5>you're exhibiting the same extremism so </v>
<v Speaker 5>so when your moral compass is so broken </v>

3218
02:35:50.410 --> 02:35:55.410
<v Speaker 5>that the guy who shares a video in </v>
<v Speaker 5>response to a question that you asked me</v>

3219
02:35:57.010 --> 02:36:02.010
<v Speaker 5>is no different than the people who are </v>
<v Speaker 5>generating the content in the video.</v>

3220
02:36:02.980 --> 02:36:07.980
<v Speaker 5>We're doomed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We need a better term for political </v>

3221
02:36:07.980 --> 02:36:07.980
<v Speaker 5>correctness</v>

3222
02:36:07.980 --> 02:36:09.430
<v Speaker 1>because that's even more extreme than </v>
<v Speaker 1>political correctness.</v>

3223
02:36:09.431 --> 02:36:13.270
<v Speaker 1>This denial of reality based on your own</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideology and that's what it is.</v>

3224
02:36:13.271 --> 02:36:18.271
<v Speaker 1>It's just this crazy sickness that in </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who consider themselves </v>

3225
02:36:18.271 --> 02:36:19.420
<v Speaker 1>intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual,</v>

3226
02:36:19.421 --> 02:36:20.740
<v Speaker 1>progressive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>open minded,</v>

3227
02:36:21.010 --> 02:36:23.150
<v Speaker 1>these are the people that exhibit this </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous train</v>

3228
02:36:23.200 --> 02:36:28.200
<v Speaker 5>because I think they just have this </v>
<v Speaker 5>instinct that to criticize an other is </v>

3229
02:36:28.200 --> 02:36:33.120
<v Speaker 5>gauche is wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially when that other is their </v>

3230
02:36:33.151 --> 02:36:34.130
<v Speaker 5>religious views,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but</v>

3231
02:36:34.130 --> 02:36:39.130
<v Speaker 1>is that true because they have no </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem criticizing the heck public and </v>

3232
02:36:39.130 --> 02:36:40.920
<v Speaker 1>senator who believes in creationism and </v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to teach it in school.</v>

3233
02:36:40.921 --> 02:36:43.610
<v Speaker 1>They're fucking hate to the end of time </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that fool.</v>

3234
02:36:43.730 --> 02:36:46.520
<v Speaker 1>That's true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if it's some in mom who thinks that,</v>

3235
02:36:46.580 --> 02:36:51.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>women should cover themselves up like </v>

3236
02:36:51.580 --> 02:36:51.590
<v Speaker 1>they look like jabba the hut or what was</v>
<v Speaker 1>the boba fett,</v>

3237
02:36:51.920 --> 02:36:54.230
<v Speaker 1>whichever one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>

3238
02:36:54.260 --> 02:36:56.720
<v Speaker 1>please direct your hate mail to joe </v>
<v Speaker 1>rogan.</v>

3239
02:36:56.740 --> 02:36:58.400
<v Speaker 1>Come coming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bringing on benches.</v>

3240
02:36:58.870 --> 02:37:02.430
<v Speaker 1>It's silliness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's my silliness is not.</v>

3241
02:37:03.240 --> 02:37:08.240
<v Speaker 1>I almost have more disdain for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are progressive that have an</v>

3242
02:37:08.781 --> 02:37:13.781
<v Speaker 1>issue with someone criticizing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I do the people that were </v>

3243
02:37:13.781 --> 02:37:17.201
<v Speaker 1>brainwashed and ingrained with religion </v>
<v Speaker 1>because these,</v>

3244
02:37:17.380 --> 02:37:21.860
<v Speaker 1>the people that are supposedly </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectuals are supposedly responsible</v>

3245
02:37:21.861 --> 02:37:23.870
<v Speaker 1>for guiding the thought of the young </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

3246
02:37:23.871 --> 02:37:28.871
<v Speaker 1>the people that are supposed to be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>folks that are the ones that are the </v>

3247
02:37:29.181 --> 02:37:34.181
<v Speaker 1>curators of these ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones that are the ones who are </v>

3248
02:37:34.181 --> 02:37:37.601
<v Speaker 1>teaching children in school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's these are the wise ones who are </v>

3249
02:37:37.601 --> 02:37:41.021
<v Speaker 1>professionally intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're supposed to be professionally </v>

3250
02:37:41.021 --> 02:37:44.381
<v Speaker 1>objective professionally wise and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have this ridiculous notion because of </v>

3251
02:37:45.020 --> 02:37:49.010
<v Speaker 1>the environment that we live in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where this politically correct,</v>

3252
02:37:49.070 --> 02:37:53.210
<v Speaker 1>whatever you wanna call it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideology has has gotten so infected.</v>

3253

<v Speaker 5>it really is amazing to kind of </v>
<v Speaker 5>understand,</v>

3277
02:38:59.260 --> 02:39:02.170
<v Speaker 5>understand the schizophrenia position or</v>

<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a huge movement.</v>

3281
02:39:08.711 --> 02:39:11.410
<v Speaker 1>I need a t shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Queers for palestine t show.</v>

3282
02:39:11.411 --> 02:39:16.411
<v Speaker 1>It's fine if they have a cafe press.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which area in the middle east can you be</v>

3283
02:39:17.470 --> 02:39:20.380
<v Speaker 5>opened and assume your sexual </v>
<v Speaker 5>orientation?</v>

3284
02:39:20.590 --> 02:39:21.780
<v Speaker 5>It's an Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

3285
02:39:21.890 --> 02:39:26.890
<v Speaker 5>Yet what's going to happen to you in </v>
<v Speaker 5>some of those other areas is not going </v>

3286
02:39:26.890 --> 02:39:31.381
<v Speaker 5>to be very pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and yet these people are able to </v>

3287
02:39:31.381 --> 02:39:31.381
<v Speaker 5>completely disassociate from that </v>
<v Speaker 5>reality.</v>

3288
02:39:31.381 --> 02:39:33.040
<v Speaker 5>It's like uncle tom's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>

3289
02:39:33.110 --> 02:39:35.050
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of along those lines,</v>

3290
02:39:35.890 --> 02:39:36.460
<v Speaker 5>I suppose</v>

3291
02:39:36.740 --> 02:39:38.000
<v Speaker 1>a way that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3292
02:39:38.001 --> 02:39:41.720
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that for whatever reason,</v>

3293
02:39:41.910 --> 02:39:45.980
<v Speaker 1>this one religion is the one that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>not supposed to criticize.</v>

3294
02:39:46.280 --> 02:39:51.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand how that happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if it's connected in some way </v>

3295
02:39:51.280 --> 02:39:53.270
<v Speaker 1>to the suppression of the people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>live in these places.</v>

3296
02:39:53.271 --> 02:39:56.870
<v Speaker 1>Where are natural resources is being </v>
<v Speaker 1>stolen by the war machine,</v>

3297
02:39:57.170 --> 02:39:59.000
<v Speaker 1>which is undeniable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>undeniable.</v>

3298
02:39:59.001 --> 02:40:02.510
<v Speaker 1>What's going on in Iraq or Afghanistan?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much of it,</v>

3299
02:40:02.511 --> 02:40:04.610
<v Speaker 1>how much of the hustle has to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the natural resources,</v>

3300
02:40:04.611 --> 02:40:09.611
<v Speaker 1>whether they be the poppy fields,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it be the minerals in </v>

3301
02:40:09.611 --> 02:40:09.611
<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's the oil in Iraq,</v>

3302
02:40:09.611 --> 02:40:14.440
<v Speaker 1>the undeniable that these people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>being sure for sure they're are subject </v>

3303
02:40:14.440 --> 02:40:16.770
<v Speaker 1>to the war machine that's coming in to </v>
<v Speaker 1>steal the resources.</v>

3304
02:40:16.790 --> 02:40:17.500
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>

3305
02:40:17.510 --> 02:40:22.510
<v Speaker 1>that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's something that people are aware </v>

3306
02:40:22.510 --> 02:40:26.091
<v Speaker 1>of and you see these images of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and these islamic countries that </v>

3307
02:40:26.091 --> 02:40:30.561
<v Speaker 1>are dying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're getting bombed on and and also </v>

3308
02:40:30.561 --> 02:40:33.561
<v Speaker 1>the dea humanism that they're subjected </v>
<v Speaker 1>to by a lot of people that are trying to</v>

3309
02:40:33.721 --> 02:40:35.880
<v Speaker 1>justify this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these wars,</v>

3310
02:40:36.210 --> 02:40:41.210
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is the only thing that makes sense </v>

3311
02:40:41.210 --> 02:40:41.210
<v Speaker 1>to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also the fact that this has happened</v>

3312
02:40:41.210 --> 02:40:46.131
<v Speaker 1>over the course of since 2001.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is when this anti islamophobia </v>

3313
02:40:47.580 --> 02:40:51.270
<v Speaker 1>notion has been really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really pushed harder and harder.</v>

3314
02:40:51.620 --> 02:40:53.480
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's also because that's the way</v>

3315
02:40:53.481 --> 02:40:58.481
<v Speaker 5>that I demonstrate how tolerant and </v>
<v Speaker 5>progressive I am by showing that I am </v>

3316
02:40:58.481 --> 02:41:02.330
<v Speaker 5>not going to lump everybody with those </v>
<v Speaker 5>crazy nine slash 11 people.</v>

3317
02:41:02.630 --> 02:41:07.630
<v Speaker 5>And so again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's part of that progressive posing a </v>

3318
02:41:07.630 --> 02:41:11.050
<v Speaker 5>no ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no belief system is free from mockery </v>

3319
02:41:11.660 --> 02:41:15.560
<v Speaker 5>from criticism.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the quicker we find that out and the</v>

3320
02:41:15.561 --> 02:41:18.320
<v Speaker 5>quicker we fixed this problem,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the better we'll be off.</v>

3321
02:41:18.440 --> 02:41:22.320
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that that's possible?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is the internet in this is.</v>

3322
02:41:22.330 --> 02:41:27.330
<v Speaker 1>This is where it gets really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His internet is supposedly where the </v>

3323
02:41:27.330 --> 02:41:28.670
<v Speaker 1>ideas come out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

3324
02:41:28.880 --> 02:41:30.650
<v Speaker 1>This is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the age of information.</v>

3325
02:41:30.651 --> 02:41:33.350
<v Speaker 1>This is where it's all on the table.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're saying is it,</v>

3326
02:41:33.470 --> 02:41:38.470
<v Speaker 1>is it is going to be possible to </v>
<v Speaker 1>suppress criticisms of islam for much </v>

3327
02:41:38.470 --> 02:41:38.990
<v Speaker 1>longer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3328
02:41:39.090 --> 02:41:41.710
<v Speaker 1>Is it going to be possible to keep up </v>
<v Speaker 1>this ridiculous facade?</v>

3329
02:41:41.760 --> 02:41:42.540
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>

3330
02:41:42.720 --> 02:41:47.720
<v Speaker 5>I think one of the ways that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>suppress it is by creating an ethos of </v>

3331
02:41:47.911 --> 02:41:49.740
<v Speaker 5>self censorship.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

3332
02:41:50.790 --> 02:41:55.790
<v Speaker 5>so if I open up my laptop and I can </v>
<v Speaker 5>write on my psychology today,</v>

3333
02:41:56.971 --> 02:41:58.410
<v Speaker 5>blog,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the 3 million people,</v>

3334
02:41:58.500 --> 02:42:00.990
<v Speaker 5>I have a real clear choice to make that </v>
<v Speaker 5>day.</v>

3335
02:42:01.290 --> 02:42:06.060
<v Speaker 5>Am I going to write something that can </v>
<v Speaker 5>bring heat to my young children?</v>

3336
02:42:06.450 --> 02:42:08.700
<v Speaker 5>And then I have to decide whether I'm </v>
<v Speaker 5>willing to do that or not.</v>

3337
02:42:08.970 --> 02:42:13.970
<v Speaker 5>Now the fact that I've already engaged </v>
<v Speaker 5>in that calculus in that calculation </v>

3338
02:42:13.970 --> 02:42:17.940
<v Speaker 5>suggests that we are the canaries </v>
<v Speaker 5>singing in the coal mine.</v>

3339
02:42:18.270 --> 02:42:23.270
<v Speaker 5>And so I think we have to be in an </v>
<v Speaker 5>environment where we don't engage in </v>

3340
02:42:23.270 --> 02:42:23.280
<v Speaker 5>this type of self censorship.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

3341
02:42:23.700 --> 02:42:27.240
<v Speaker 5>so I think we're definitely down the </v>
<v Speaker 5>wrong road.</v>

3342
02:42:27.330 --> 02:42:29.310
<v Speaker 5>I think many academics,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3343
02:42:29.550 --> 02:42:33.630
<v Speaker 5>privately will speak about these issues </v>
<v Speaker 5>very openly with me,</v>

3344
02:42:33.840 --> 02:42:38.840
<v Speaker 5>but we'll never even so far as go as to </v>
<v Speaker 5>like something on facebook less they </v>

3345
02:42:38.840 --> 02:42:39.060
<v Speaker 5>will be.</v>

3346
02:42:39.110 --> 02:42:43.190
<v Speaker 1>I found out so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to worry about your standing.</v>

3347
02:42:43.191 --> 02:42:46.820
<v Speaker 1>You gotta worry about your public </v>
<v Speaker 1>standing gotta worry about your Job.</v>

3348
02:42:46.821 --> 02:42:51.821
<v Speaker 1>You gotta work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's more people to be self </v>

3349
02:42:51.821 --> 02:42:51.821
<v Speaker 1>sufficient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3350
02:42:51.821 --> 02:42:52.700
<v Speaker 1>less to tHink about in that regard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you're an educator,</v>

3351
02:42:52.701 --> 02:42:54.770
<v Speaker 1>how can you be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>in one sense,</v>

3352
02:42:54.771 --> 02:42:56.780
<v Speaker 1>you have tenure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That kind of helps a lot.</v>

3353
02:42:57.080 --> 02:43:02.080
<v Speaker 1>But tenure creates a lot of hubris.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of guys who have tenure </v>

3354
02:43:02.080 --> 02:43:05.621
<v Speaker 1>that also become untouchable and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>force feed their students their ideas.</v>

3355
02:43:05.841 --> 02:43:06.300
<v Speaker 1>Apologies.</v>

3356
02:43:06.320 --> 02:43:07.020
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>absolutely.</v>

3357
02:43:07.050 --> 02:43:10.230
<v Speaker 5>And actually I wrote an article on my </v>
<v Speaker 5>psychology today blog,</v>

3358
02:43:10.231 --> 02:43:12.340
<v Speaker 5>what I was talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the necessity for tenure,</v>

3359
02:43:12.400 --> 02:43:15.310
<v Speaker 3>but also its potential for misuse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3360
02:43:15.670 --> 02:43:19.150
<v Speaker 3>Because you do get an incredible amount </v>
<v Speaker 3>of deadwood with tenure.</v>

3361
02:43:19.660 --> 02:43:24.340
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you foresee a time where universities</v>

3362
02:43:24.341 --> 02:43:29.341
<v Speaker 3>won't be the main source of education </v>
<v Speaker 3>that was somehow or another to be taken </v>

3363
02:43:29.341 --> 02:43:29.830
<v Speaker 3>care of online?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good question.</v>

3364
02:43:29.831 --> 02:43:31.450
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right now there's a development of.</v>

3365
02:43:31.451 --> 02:43:33.670
<v Speaker 3>Have you heard of moocs are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

3366
02:43:33.970 --> 02:43:38.970
<v Speaker 3>Moocs are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know joey diaz calls moocs or fucking </v>

3367
02:43:38.970 --> 02:43:38.970
<v Speaker 3>move over here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3368
02:43:38.970 --> 02:43:38.970
<v Speaker 3>he had dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3369
02:43:39.120 --> 02:43:41.140
<v Speaker 3>The ball.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

3370
02:43:41.141 --> 02:43:46.141
<v Speaker 3>right here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A mooka know a moocs are a massive </v>

3371
02:43:46.511 --> 02:43:47.870
<v Speaker 3>online.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember the rest of the day.</v>

3372
02:43:48.430 --> 02:43:53.430
<v Speaker 3>These are courses that are often times </v>
<v Speaker 3>offered under the auspices of a </v>

3373
02:43:53.430 --> 02:43:57.031
<v Speaker 3>university,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're free courses where people </v>

3374
02:43:57.031 --> 02:43:59.080
<v Speaker 3>can massively registered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have a teaching a course,</v>

3375
02:43:59.260 --> 02:44:00.670
<v Speaker 3>100,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

3376
02:44:00.880 --> 02:44:03.190
<v Speaker 3>Mit does that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mit does that as a whole lot.</v>

3377
02:44:03.270 --> 02:44:08.270
<v Speaker 3>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tried to to hook up with these guys </v>

3378
02:44:08.270 --> 02:44:09.730
<v Speaker 3>called coursera that organizes a portal </v>
<v Speaker 3>for this,</v>

3379
02:44:09.731 --> 02:44:14.731
<v Speaker 3>but they don't have a contract with </v>
<v Speaker 3>concordia and it has to be between a </v>

3380
02:44:14.731 --> 02:44:16.840
<v Speaker 3>university and the organization for it </v>
<v Speaker 3>to fly.</v>

3381
02:44:17.230 --> 02:44:22.230
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I do see a potential eventually for </v>

3382
02:44:22.230 --> 02:44:23.110
<v Speaker 3>sort of a more democratization of </v>
<v Speaker 3>knowledge,</v>

3383
02:44:23.590 --> 02:44:26.680
<v Speaker 3>but I don't suspect that we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>lose the university anytime soon.</v>

3384
02:44:26.800 --> 02:44:29.050
<v Speaker 3>This is the social aspect of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's so interesting.</v>

3385
02:44:29.051 --> 02:44:34.051
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people go away and the party and they </v>

3386
02:44:34.051 --> 02:44:34.051
<v Speaker 3>have fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They find themselves in Canada though.</v>

3387
02:44:34.051 --> 02:44:34.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting.</v>

3388
02:44:34.740 --> 02:44:37.090
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] I've studied both in the us </v>
<v Speaker 3>and in Canada.</v>

3389
02:44:37.140 --> 02:44:42.140
<v Speaker 3>A yes part of my study.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so this greek system going away to </v>

3390
02:44:42.140 --> 02:44:44.290
<v Speaker 3>college,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not being close to your parents,</v>

3391
02:44:44.480 --> 02:44:45.190
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3392
02:44:45.191 --> 02:44:47.710
<v Speaker 3>the drinking games,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's very much,</v>

3393
02:44:47.830 --> 02:44:52.270
<v Speaker 3>much more so of an american right of </v>
<v Speaker 3>passage then it is a canadian.</v>

3394
02:44:52.271 --> 02:44:57.271
<v Speaker 3>Most canadian students end up going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the school that is physically closest to</v>

3395
02:44:57.401 --> 02:44:58.810
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>

3396
02:44:58.811 --> 02:45:01.770
<v Speaker 3>Is that because it's so paid for by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>government.</v>

3397
02:45:01.771 --> 02:45:02.740
<v Speaker 3>So you've got.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got it.</v>

3398
02:45:02.741 --> 02:45:05.800
<v Speaker 3>So in Canada you don't have </v>
<v Speaker 3>historically.</v>

3399
02:45:05.800 --> 02:45:08.260
<v Speaker 3>I mean now some programs are getting a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bit more privatized,</v>

3400
02:45:08.261 --> 02:45:10.600
<v Speaker 3>but historically everything is big </v>
<v Speaker 3>brother,</v>

3401
02:45:11.050 --> 02:45:15.180
<v Speaker 3>so there isn't this huge hierarchy of </v>
<v Speaker 3>universities,</v>

3402
02:45:15.310 --> 02:45:20.310
<v Speaker 3>the harvard and then whatever and all </v>
<v Speaker 3>schools are public and so yes,</v>

3403
02:45:20.650 --> 02:45:24.490
<v Speaker 3>mcgill university is more famous than </v>
<v Speaker 3>some other kenyan university,</v>

3404
02:45:24.491 --> 02:45:29.491
<v Speaker 3>but on average all canadian schools are </v>
<v Speaker 3>quite good and you have about 40 </v>

3405
02:45:29.491 --> 02:45:32.470
<v Speaker 3>universities and so there's really no </v>
<v Speaker 3>point in choosing between them and going</v>

3406
02:45:32.471 --> 02:45:37.471
<v Speaker 3>across the country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In the us you have 3000 colleges and </v>

3407
02:45:37.471 --> 02:45:41.941
<v Speaker 3>universities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's wildly varying on everything in </v>

3408
02:45:41.941 --> 02:45:42.310
<v Speaker 3>terms of price,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in terms of quality.</v>

3409
02:45:42.490 --> 02:45:46.390
<v Speaker 3>And so I think that's what makes it a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bit more exciting to choose and pick.</v>

3410
02:45:46.391 --> 02:45:48.160
<v Speaker 3>But then Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're all good.</v>

3411
02:45:48.220 --> 02:45:53.220
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in the United States they also have </v>

3412
02:45:53.220 --> 02:45:55.580
<v Speaker 3>universities that cater specifically to </v>
<v Speaker 3>religious ideas too.</v>

3413
02:45:56.260 --> 02:45:57.480
<v Speaker 3>Like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was the one that,</v>

3414
02:45:57.481 --> 02:45:58.080
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3415
02:45:58.150 --> 02:46:03.150
<v Speaker 3>someone got in trouble for during one of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the elections for taking support from </v>

3416
02:46:03.150 --> 02:46:05.530
<v Speaker 3>and that they wouldn't allow interracial</v>
<v Speaker 3>couples.</v>

3417
02:46:05.860 --> 02:46:07.180
<v Speaker 3>Remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brigham young.</v>

3418
02:46:07.530 --> 02:46:10.100
<v Speaker 3>Was it bringing me up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might've been bringing me on.</v>

3419
02:46:10.160 --> 02:46:11.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember which one it was,</v>

3420
02:46:11.481 --> 02:46:15.320
<v Speaker 1>but if some southern university,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I forget who they were supporting,</v>

3421
02:46:15.321 --> 02:46:20.321
<v Speaker 1>but it became a big problem with them </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they had had become aligned with </v>

3422
02:46:20.751 --> 02:46:25.100
<v Speaker 1>this university that didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't allow interracial couples like,</v>

3423
02:46:25.160 --> 02:46:25.820
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3424
02:46:25.940 --> 02:46:27.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at what time the,</v>

3425
02:46:27.810 --> 02:46:30.320
<v Speaker 1>the real problem with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously it's racist,</v>

3426
02:46:30.321 --> 02:46:35.321
<v Speaker 1>but also the varying scales of race.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like is it only pure blood,</v>

3427
02:46:36.790 --> 02:46:38.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you a fucking vampire?</v>

3428
02:46:38.391 --> 02:46:43.391
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what if someone is like one slash </v>

3429
02:46:43.391 --> 02:46:43.910
<v Speaker 1>16th native american is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>from Norway.</v>

3431
02:46:47.780 --> 02:46:51.060
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if the woman is like one eighth,</v>

3432
02:46:51.140 --> 02:46:53.690
<v Speaker 1>chinese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one corridor,</v>

3433
02:46:53.691 --> 02:46:56.870
<v Speaker 1>like when do we draw the line and she's </v>
<v Speaker 1>half chinese.</v>

3434
02:46:57.240 --> 02:46:59.960
<v Speaker 1>Like what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if she lies about it and said she's</v>

3435
02:46:59.961 --> 02:47:04.961
<v Speaker 1>eskimo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To think that if only I converted the </v>

3436
02:47:04.961 --> 02:47:08.531
<v Speaker 1>seventh day adventist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could be living in southern </v>

3437
02:47:08.531 --> 02:47:08.531
<v Speaker 1>California.</v>

3438
02:47:08.531 --> 02:47:08.531
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

3439
02:47:08.531 --> 02:47:10.310
<v Speaker 1>you could've been rocking it and teach </v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit and teach them bullshit in line</v>

3440
02:47:10.311 --> 02:47:11.660
<v Speaker 1>about jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would have been awesome.</v>

3441
02:47:11.690 --> 02:47:14.480
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I still might accept them hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3442
02:47:14.481 --> 02:47:19.481
<v Speaker 1>you've been tanning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can tend to montreal to for about </v>

3443
02:47:19.481 --> 02:47:19.481
<v Speaker 1>three weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Montreal,</v>

3444
02:47:19.481 --> 02:47:20.540
<v Speaker 1>you probably know this joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have four seasons,</v>

3445
02:47:21.110 --> 02:47:21.890
<v Speaker 1>winter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>winter,</v>

3446
02:47:21.891 --> 02:47:24.410
<v Speaker 1>winter and july.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>

3447
02:47:24.770 --> 02:47:29.770
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>july is pretty awesome though and </v>

3448
02:47:29.770 --> 02:47:31.360
<v Speaker 1>everybody's very festive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I love about any </v>

3449
02:47:31.360 --> 02:47:34.530
<v Speaker 1>place like Canada or a lot of parts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada is that they really appreciate </v>

3450
02:47:35.960 --> 02:47:38.630
<v Speaker 1>the summertime because of the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>water so brutal.</v>

3451
02:47:38.660 --> 02:47:40.130
<v Speaker 1>We oVercame it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly right.</v>

3452
02:47:40.430 --> 02:47:45.430
<v Speaker 1>It's the festival sort of city of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world because we're completely cocooned </v>

3453
02:47:45.471 --> 02:47:50.300
<v Speaker 1>from say end of november till say mid </v>
<v Speaker 1>april and so we make up for it.</v>

3454
02:47:50.660 --> 02:47:53.990
<v Speaker 1>I think it also develops character too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've talked about los angeles and that a</v>

3455
02:47:53.991 --> 02:47:56.130
<v Speaker 1>lot of people that are born and raised </v>
<v Speaker 1>in los angeles,</v>

3456
02:47:56.131 --> 02:47:59.300
<v Speaker 1>so like spoiled rich kids that you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>also won the lottery.</v>

3457
02:47:59.840 --> 02:48:01.570
<v Speaker 1>TheY don't realize how easy they've got </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

3458
02:48:01.571 --> 02:48:06.571
<v Speaker 1>Like the worst the weather gets here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to hit a button and turn the </v>

3459
02:48:06.571 --> 02:48:09.140
<v Speaker 1>aca is the most brutal thing you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do is use your finger to press a button.</v>

3460
02:48:09.170 --> 02:48:10.550
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember when we lived here,</v>

3461
02:48:10.551 --> 02:48:15.551
<v Speaker 1>when I was at uc irvine one time we were</v>
<v Speaker 1>driving on the highway and there was a </v>

3462
02:48:15.551 --> 02:48:19.210
<v Speaker 1>warning weather advisory because there </v>
<v Speaker 1>was going to be 10 minutes of rain and </v>

3463
02:48:20.121 --> 02:48:25.121
<v Speaker 1>when it rains the the roads dependently </v>
<v Speaker 1>become a bit more slippery because of </v>

3464
02:48:25.161 --> 02:48:26.870
<v Speaker 1>the oil stat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know exactly what it was.</v>

3465
02:48:27.180 --> 02:48:27.830
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm thinking,</v>

3466
02:48:27.831 --> 02:48:32.831
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we drive in minus 30 degrees in small </v>

3467
02:48:32.831 --> 02:48:35.741
<v Speaker 1>stars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>TheY have warning advisories when it </v>

3468
02:48:35.741 --> 02:48:36.530
<v Speaker 1>rains for 10 minutes through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys have character.</v>

3469
02:48:36.560 --> 02:48:38.150
<v Speaker 1>We have none.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're done.</v>

3470
02:48:38.840 --> 02:48:41.360
<v Speaker 1>I'll give up my character to move to </v>
<v Speaker 1>southern California.</v>

3471
02:48:41.450 --> 02:48:43.280
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've lived a bunch of years up there.</v>

3472
02:48:43.281 --> 02:48:45.410
<v Speaker 1>You realize that the winners are not </v>
<v Speaker 1>worth it.</v>

3473
02:48:45.440 --> 02:48:46.760
<v Speaker 1>They get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are brutal.</v>

3474
02:48:46.820 --> 02:48:49.010
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you have to go anywhere.</v>

3475
02:48:49.040 --> 02:48:52.050
<v Speaker 1>If you could work out of your house all </v>
<v Speaker 1>winter long and you had a good supply of</v>

3476
02:48:52.051 --> 02:48:55.730
<v Speaker 1>wood and water and food ready for you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a bear once in a while to shoot.</v>

3477
02:48:56.420 --> 02:48:58.610
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you can stay warm and full.</v>

3478
02:48:59.180 --> 02:49:01.880
<v Speaker 1>But California,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's pros and cons.</v>

3479
02:49:01.910 --> 02:49:04.340
<v Speaker 1>The con is obviously that everybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>knows about it.</v>

3480
02:49:04.360 --> 02:49:06.890
<v Speaker 1>And so you've been here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've been here since 94.</v>

3481
02:49:06.990 --> 02:49:07.440
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

3482
02:49:07.441 --> 02:49:08.540
<v Speaker 1>So you've been here for 20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3483
02:49:08.550 --> 02:49:13.550
<v Speaker 1>it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I grew up in boston and also </v>

3484
02:49:13.550 --> 02:49:15.540
<v Speaker 1>delivered newspapers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I drove every day,</v>

3485
02:49:15.600 --> 02:49:16.920
<v Speaker 1>300,</v>
<v Speaker 1>65 days a year.</v>

3486
02:49:16.980 --> 02:49:18.510
<v Speaker 1>So snowstorms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

3487
02:49:18.960 --> 02:49:20.880
<v Speaker 1>One thing is good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know how to drive in snow.</v>

3488
02:49:20.910 --> 02:49:21.990
<v Speaker 1>I know to drive real good.</v>

3489
02:49:22.020 --> 02:49:27.020
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when the asset and my car kicks </v>

3490
02:49:27.020 --> 02:49:27.020
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't sweat it at all.</v>

3491
02:49:27.020 --> 02:49:28.590
<v Speaker 1>Countersteer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like instinctive,</v>

3492
02:49:29.190 --> 02:49:34.190
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more pleasurable to live here if </v>

3493
02:49:34.190 --> 02:49:34.190
<v Speaker 1>you don't have the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3494
02:49:34.190 --> 02:49:36.240
<v Speaker 1>could you break out into the bostonian </v>
<v Speaker 1>accent if you want it to?</v>

3495
02:49:36.330 --> 02:49:37.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kinda,</v>

3496
02:49:37.470 --> 02:49:40.200
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fought once in the bay state games,</v>

3497
02:49:40.440 --> 02:49:45.440
<v Speaker 1>which was this big olympic festivals </v>
<v Speaker 1>when taekwondo was going into the </v>

3498
02:49:45.440 --> 02:49:47.910
<v Speaker 1>olympics and I won it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I got interviewed on television.</v>

3499
02:49:47.911 --> 02:49:49.440
<v Speaker 1>I heard myself on tv.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3500
02:49:49.470 --> 02:49:52.230
<v Speaker 1>oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sound like a fucking idiot.</v>

3501
02:49:52.590 --> 02:49:54.480
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my accent was so strong.</v>

3502
02:49:54.481 --> 02:49:55.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've been working,</v>

3503
02:49:55.351 --> 02:49:57.500
<v Speaker 1>had training for this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3504
02:49:57.570 --> 02:49:59.400
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't realize.</v>

3505
02:49:59.460 --> 02:50:04.010
<v Speaker 1>I didn't realize how gross it sounded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I abandoned bandler heart too.</v>

3506
02:50:04.340 --> 02:50:09.340
<v Speaker 1>I just abandoned it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it comes out every now and then </v>

3507
02:50:09.340 --> 02:50:09.340
<v Speaker 1>if I have a couple drinks in me here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit of it.</v>

3508
02:50:09.340 --> 02:50:13.670
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's a weird accent because I've a </v>

3509
02:50:13.670 --> 02:50:13.990
<v Speaker 1>little bit of new Jersey to New Jersey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3510
02:50:14.190 --> 02:50:15.810
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're just about out of time.</v>

3511
02:50:15.840 --> 02:50:17.940
<v Speaker 1>Is there anything else you wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk aBout before?</v>

3512
02:50:17.941 --> 02:50:21.180
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted to thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe all the three hours.</v>

3513
02:50:21.181 --> 02:50:24.260
<v Speaker 1>three hours was like three minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you're best ever.</v>

3514
02:50:24.360 --> 02:50:25.650
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's ridiculous.</v>

3515
02:50:25.651 --> 02:50:28.140
<v Speaker 1>You're the best guest ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was pretty easy to do.</v>

3516
02:50:28.340 --> 02:50:29.550
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could do this 100 times,</v>

3517
02:50:29.580 --> 02:50:34.580
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me know when you're back in town </v>

3518
02:50:34.580 --> 02:50:34.580
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll do this again for sure.</v>

3519
02:50:34.580 --> 02:50:35.280
<v Speaker 1>On your books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what could people buy?</v>

3520
02:50:35.281 --> 02:50:37.320
<v Speaker 1>Where can they buy it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you suggest?</v>

3521
02:50:37.321 --> 02:50:40.510
<v Speaker 1>So I'll probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they want the sort of trade book,</v>

3522
02:50:40.610 --> 02:50:44.500
<v Speaker 1>the book that's written for the masses,</v>
