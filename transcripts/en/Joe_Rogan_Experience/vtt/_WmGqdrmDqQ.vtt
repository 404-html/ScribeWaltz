00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.830
<v Speaker 2>Not much crazy week.</v>

12
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:12.720
<v Speaker 2>Very crazy week murder</v>

13
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:13.530
<v Speaker 1>the comedy store.</v>

14
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:14.130
<v Speaker 1>Ugh,</v>

15
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:14.740
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

16
00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.000
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't saying I was supposed to go down there that night to me.</v>

17
00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.290
<v Speaker 1>I decided the day of,</v>

18
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.360
<v Speaker 1>I had too much shit to do that day and in the morning and I said no,</v>

19
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:23.790
<v Speaker 1>and I don't need to do a set tonight.</v>

20
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.070
<v Speaker 1>I was going to in Wam do the stand up on the spot show which was on before the</v>

21
00:00:29.071 --> 00:00:33.630
<v Speaker 1>roast battle show and I guess where is the show going on in the main room?</v>

22
00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.650
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

23
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.870
<v Speaker 1>it was one of those air quotes.</v>

24
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.430
<v Speaker 1>Urban air quote.</v>

25
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.133
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

26
00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.180
<v Speaker 1>They scratch records and they have more melanin and some shit went down and I'm</v>

27
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.041
<v Speaker 1>not that it matters.</v>

28
00:00:47.041 --> 00:00:47.874
<v Speaker 1>It was a box show.</v>

29
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.290
<v Speaker 1>Obviously it could have been a white show.</v>

30
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:49.681
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

31
00:00:49.681 --> 00:00:51.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe it was anybody in the show.</v>

32
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.380
<v Speaker 1>I think it was just people in the audience and there was a guy on a patio and</v>

33
00:00:55.381 --> 00:00:56.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

34
00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.640
<v Speaker 1>obviously I have like 15 tanned information,</v>

35
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.920
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

36
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.810
<v Speaker 1>there was story is that this guy just walked right up to this guy and just shot</v>

37
00:01:03.811 --> 00:01:05.250
<v Speaker 1>him a bunch of times.</v>

38
00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:06.223
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

39
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.760
<v Speaker 2>It's weird how,</v>

40
00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:08.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

41
00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.520
<v Speaker 2>I sent you that China did one of those reenactments of it where it's just</v>

42
00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.330
<v Speaker 2>commercials rather cdis and it's really ridiculous how they show it.</v>

43
00:01:17.331 --> 00:01:21.830
<v Speaker 2>And so I've been showing it around cause there's a lot of us are always there</v>

44
00:01:21.831 --> 00:01:23.900
<v Speaker 2>Tuesday nights and rose,</v>

45
00:01:23.901 --> 00:01:26.000
<v Speaker 2>the bartender was standing right there.</v>

46
00:01:26.001 --> 00:01:26.451
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>

47
00:01:26.451 --> 00:01:26.781
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

48
00:01:26.781 --> 00:01:28.310
<v Speaker 2>she helped afterwards.</v>

49
00:01:28.311 --> 00:01:28.451
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

50
00:01:28.451 --> 00:01:29.440
<v Speaker 2>By putting a,</v>

51
00:01:29.441 --> 00:01:29.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

52
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.280
<v Speaker 2>towels and stuff on the guy.</v>

53
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.800
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people at Francisco Ramos,</v>

54
00:01:33.801 --> 00:01:35.960
<v Speaker 2>which was standing right next to Matt Edgar,</v>

55
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.100
<v Speaker 2>a lot of our friends were hanging out on the patio because roast battle was</v>

56
00:01:40.101 --> 00:01:41.630
<v Speaker 2>going on and it's so,</v>

57
00:01:41.631 --> 00:01:41.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

58
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.370
<v Speaker 2>crowded for roast battle that a lot of us just sit in the front patio and watch</v>

59
00:01:45.371 --> 00:01:46.204
<v Speaker 2>the Chinese.</v>

60
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.660
<v Speaker 2>It's a first of all note how everyone's white at Daca.</v>

61
00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:51.543
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

62
00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:52.750
<v Speaker 1>So was it from there?</v>

63
00:01:52.751 --> 00:01:54.370
<v Speaker 1>While it does like the comedy store,</v>

64
00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:55.660
<v Speaker 1>is that where it happened from?</v>

65
00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:56.181
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

66
00:01:56.181 --> 00:01:59.960
<v Speaker 2>they're saying that what rose is saying that this is not the side that came on.</v>

67
00:01:59.961 --> 00:02:02.030
<v Speaker 2>It was more right in the middle,</v>

68
00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.271
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

69
00:02:02.271 --> 00:02:03.104
<v Speaker 2>the insurance.</v>

70
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.333
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

71
00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:06.960
<v Speaker 1>and was he that far away?</v>

72
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.790
<v Speaker 2>They're also saying he ran across the street,</v>

73
00:02:08.791 --> 00:02:12.990
<v Speaker 2>which is another thing a lot of people say that he got into a car and the car</v>

74
00:02:12.991 --> 00:02:13.890
<v Speaker 2>went down the street.</v>

75
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.510
<v Speaker 2>Other people were saying he didn't get in the car.</v>

76
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.940
<v Speaker 2>And it's interesting because there are so many people there,</v>

77
00:02:17.941 --> 00:02:20.850
<v Speaker 2>but yet they haven't released anything about the,</v>

78
00:02:20.851 --> 00:02:21.071
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

79
00:02:21.071 --> 00:02:22.980
<v Speaker 2>the shooter except that he had a hoodie on,</v>

80
00:02:22.981 --> 00:02:24.630
<v Speaker 2>not like color of Hoodie Height,</v>

81
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:25.141
<v Speaker 2>nothing,</v>

82
00:02:25.141 --> 00:02:26.010
<v Speaker 2>which was odd,</v>

83
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.330
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

84
00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.770
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

85
00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.010
<v Speaker 2>but it happened so fast.</v>

86
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.680
<v Speaker 2>They say,</v>

87
00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how those things usually work.</v>

88
00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they give up all the information like about the suspect.</v>

89
00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:36.940
<v Speaker 1>The problem is if you,</v>

90
00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.160
<v Speaker 1>if you tell people what it was like,</v>

91
00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:40.391
<v Speaker 1>here's,</v>

92
00:02:40.391 --> 00:02:40.781
<v Speaker 1>here's a,</v>

93
00:02:40.781 --> 00:02:43.630
<v Speaker 1>this is a really weird thing that happens when people see stuff,</v>

94
00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.000
<v Speaker 1>the people see things,</v>

95
00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.760
<v Speaker 1>and then the recollection of what they actually saw.</v>

96
00:02:48.761 --> 00:02:50.560
<v Speaker 1>Oftentimes it's way off.</v>

97
00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.860
<v Speaker 1>Like they've done these experiments with people where they've,</v>

98
00:02:53.861 --> 00:02:54.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

99
00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.420
<v Speaker 1>put them in stressful situations.</v>

100
00:02:56.421 --> 00:02:57.790
<v Speaker 1>It's like a fake bank robbery.</v>

101
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.270
<v Speaker 1>And then they ask them to what happened and people,</v>

102
00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.840
<v Speaker 1>they get it so wrong and they think their head that it's right.</v>

103
00:03:04.841 --> 00:03:05.021
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

104
00:03:05.021 --> 00:03:07.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure I've got some memories in my head like that,</v>

105
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:08.680
<v Speaker 1>that are all fucked up.</v>

106
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.390
<v Speaker 1>And I'm sure you have some in your head.</v>

107
00:03:10.391 --> 00:03:11.224
<v Speaker 1>I just think,</v>

108
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.660
<v Speaker 1>I think what our memory,</v>

109
00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:14.250
<v Speaker 1>we'd love,</v>

110
00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.590
<v Speaker 1>we would like to think it's like some stuff written down on paper or a video</v>

111
00:03:17.591 --> 00:03:18.850
<v Speaker 1>that you can watch and review.</v>

112
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:19.661
<v Speaker 1>But it's not,</v>

113
00:03:19.661 --> 00:03:19.981
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

114
00:03:19.981 --> 00:03:21.040
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking very,</v>

115
00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:22.151
<v Speaker 1>very strange,</v>

116
00:03:22.151 --> 00:03:26.290
<v Speaker 1>especially when it comes to something like a murder where someone steps out and</v>

117
00:03:26.291 --> 00:03:26.621
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>

118
00:03:26.621 --> 00:03:27.454
<v Speaker 1>just shoot somebody.</v>

119
00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:28.420
<v Speaker 1>So if you say,</v>

120
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.110
<v Speaker 1>we're looking for a five foot 10 black male with a red Hoodie,</v>

121
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.550
<v Speaker 1>people going to find that guy.</v>

122
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:34.481
<v Speaker 1>They're gonna see it,</v>

123
00:03:34.481 --> 00:03:35.890
<v Speaker 1>they're gonna think it thinking that.</v>

124
00:03:35.891 --> 00:03:40.891
<v Speaker 1>But if you say we're looking for a five foot 11 thin white male with a British</v>

125
00:03:42.821 --> 00:03:43.654
<v Speaker 1>accent,</v>

126
00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:44.651
<v Speaker 1>then they'll say,</v>

127
00:03:44.651 --> 00:03:45.461
<v Speaker 1>I saw that guy.</v>

128
00:03:45.461 --> 00:03:46.300
<v Speaker 1>I know it was him.</v>

129
00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.660
<v Speaker 1>There's going to be a certain amount of people that will tell you,</v>

130
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.570
<v Speaker 1>even though they saw a black guy in their head,</v>

131
00:03:52.571 --> 00:03:55.900
<v Speaker 1>they'll see that five foot tall 11 English guy and the go,</v>

132
00:03:55.901 --> 00:03:57.100
<v Speaker 1>yes was,</v>

133
00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.700
<v Speaker 1>I did think he was English like in their head,</v>

134
00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:03.190
<v Speaker 1>especially with like trauma and the fear of the instance,</v>

135
00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.110
<v Speaker 1>they are notoriously unreliable.</v>

136
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:10.230
<v Speaker 1>That's why like when scientists talk about anecdotal evidence and evidence of</v>

137
00:04:10.781 --> 00:04:11.740
<v Speaker 1>people's experiences,</v>

138
00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.410
<v Speaker 1>when you're trying to talk about like paranormal shit especially,</v>

139
00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:15.790
<v Speaker 1>so people say,</v>

140
00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:16.270
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

141
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:17.530
<v Speaker 1>you can't tell me what I saw.</v>

142
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:18.520
<v Speaker 1>I know what I saw.</v>

143
00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.900
<v Speaker 1>Do your really,</v>

144
00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:21.620
<v Speaker 1>do you really know what you saw?</v>

145
00:04:21.621 --> 00:04:23.380
<v Speaker 1>Because I don't know what I saw a lot of times,</v>

146
00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.470
<v Speaker 1>like if you looked at my memory just from like yesterday,</v>

147
00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.620
<v Speaker 1>it's a blur of some snapshots,</v>

148
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.921
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

149
00:04:29.921 --> 00:04:31.120
<v Speaker 1>And I had a great day.</v>

150
00:04:31.121 --> 00:04:36.121
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't drunk hanging out with the family but picked out some pumpkin's w saw</v>

151
00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.750
<v Speaker 1>fucking pig race went to this foreign place where they,</v>

152
00:04:40.751 --> 00:04:41.021
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

153
00:04:41.021 --> 00:04:42.340
<v Speaker 1>they let you pick out your own pumpkin.</v>

154
00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:43.120
<v Speaker 1>It's fun.</v>

155
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.781
<v Speaker 1>It's a bunch of kids.</v>

156
00:04:43.781 --> 00:04:44.171
<v Speaker 1>It was cute.</v>

157
00:04:44.171 --> 00:04:47.330
<v Speaker 1>We had a good time wetting up corn maze,</v>

158
00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:47.621
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

159
00:04:47.621 --> 00:04:48.330
<v Speaker 1>But my,</v>

160
00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:49.001
<v Speaker 1>my memory,</v>

161
00:04:49.001 --> 00:04:51.670
<v Speaker 1>my important thing is like totally sober,</v>

162
00:04:51.671 --> 00:04:52.870
<v Speaker 1>having a great time.</v>

163
00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:54.040
<v Speaker 1>Lots of laughs.</v>

164
00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:55.150
<v Speaker 1>But my memory like,</v>

165
00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.421
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

166
00:04:55.421 --> 00:04:56.560
<v Speaker 1>then we did that and then we did it.</v>

167
00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:57.550
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah we did that too.</v>

168
00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:00.670
<v Speaker 1>I had some that eh had a sandwich and these,</v>

169
00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.920
<v Speaker 1>these like this idea that,</v>

170
00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

171
00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.720
<v Speaker 1>we have this infallible memory.</v>

172
00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:07.800
<v Speaker 1>I think when you start putting out information like a,</v>

173
00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.360
<v Speaker 1>this is what the guy definitely looked like based on who?</v>

174
00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:11.223
<v Speaker 1>Based on whose head,</v>

175
00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:12.550
<v Speaker 1>who said it looks like that.</v>

176
00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:13.810
<v Speaker 1>The people that saw the shooting.</v>

177
00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.920
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

178
00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:15.191
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

179
00:05:15.191 --> 00:05:16.600
<v Speaker 1>If you don't have a photo,</v>

180
00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:17.050
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

181
00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.200
<v Speaker 1>you better be real careful what you say because these people that saw the</v>

182
00:05:20.201 --> 00:05:20.591
<v Speaker 1>shooting,</v>

183
00:05:20.591 --> 00:05:20.831
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

184
00:05:20.831 --> 00:05:21.664
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>

185
00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean some of them might be good at it,</v>

186
00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.970
<v Speaker 1>but we all know somebody who fucking sucks at remembering stories.</v>

187
00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.391
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

188
00:05:28.391 --> 00:05:28.810
<v Speaker 1>we all,</v>

189
00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.450
<v Speaker 1>we all have that one person that is terrible at it,</v>

190
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:32.770
<v Speaker 2>especially in a time of panic.</v>

191
00:05:32.771 --> 00:05:34.210
<v Speaker 2>I know when I got robbed,</v>

192
00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:37.300
<v Speaker 2>I remember he had a fake beard and in,</v>

193
00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:38.141
<v Speaker 2>but that's about it.</v>

194
00:05:38.141 --> 00:05:39.130
<v Speaker 2>Like I didn't like,</v>

195
00:05:39.131 --> 00:05:39.970
<v Speaker 2>I had some kind of coat,</v>

196
00:05:39.971 --> 00:05:41.980
<v Speaker 2>but I don't remember like I was staring at him.</v>

197
00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:43.060
<v Speaker 2>I should be able to know like,</v>

198
00:05:43.061 --> 00:05:43.301
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

199
00:05:43.301 --> 00:05:44.560
<v Speaker 2>he had a purple shirt on.</v>

200
00:05:44.561 --> 00:05:44.861
<v Speaker 2>He had it.</v>

201
00:05:44.861 --> 00:05:45.694
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

202
00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.580
<v Speaker 2>isn't it funny that fake beards are not allowed?</v>

203
00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:49.563
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

204
00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.090
<v Speaker 1>if you are a man and you wear a toupee,</v>

205
00:05:52.091 --> 00:05:53.440
<v Speaker 1>you can go through Tsa with it.</v>

206
00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:54.520
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

207
00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.810
<v Speaker 1>They'll leave that stupid fake hair glued deer.</v>

208
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:00.920
<v Speaker 1>That's so strange.</v>

209
00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:03.250
<v Speaker 1>But if you tried to go through Tsa with a fake mustache,</v>

210
00:06:03.251 --> 00:06:03.561
<v Speaker 1>he'd be like,</v>

211
00:06:03.561 --> 00:06:05.150
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are you trying to pull?</v>

212
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:06.011
<v Speaker 1>But if you,</v>

213
00:06:06.011 --> 00:06:07.910
<v Speaker 1>you can go in there with a mop up here.</v>

214
00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:11.330
<v Speaker 1>I wonder how long your fake hair can be before they go.</v>

215
00:06:11.331 --> 00:06:11.661
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

216
00:06:11.661 --> 00:06:13.250
<v Speaker 1>you fuck take that thing off.</v>

217
00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:16.070
<v Speaker 1>What could you go in there with like a giant lion's mane?</v>

218
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.061
<v Speaker 1>Like if you,</v>

219
00:06:17.061 --> 00:06:18.860
<v Speaker 1>if you went in there with some crazy,</v>

220
00:06:18.861 --> 00:06:23.510
<v Speaker 1>if you were to stone called bald and you went in there with a glued on Fabio</v>

221
00:06:23.511 --> 00:06:23.871
<v Speaker 1>wig,</v>

222
00:06:23.871 --> 00:06:27.980
<v Speaker 1>like a full Fabio that goes all the way down to your ass or even crazier.</v>

223
00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:29.730
<v Speaker 1>Like there was a dude that I was um,</v>

224
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.700
<v Speaker 1>I was at the House of Blues in Houston a couple of weeks ago and uh,</v>

225
00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:34.220
<v Speaker 1>it was great.</v>

226
00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:34.671
<v Speaker 1>It was awesome.</v>

227
00:06:34.671 --> 00:06:36.410
<v Speaker 1>Meaning you Edwards and a,</v>

228
00:06:36.411 --> 00:06:38.850
<v Speaker 1>there was a dude has been grown his hair for 14 years.</v>

229
00:06:38.851 --> 00:06:39.684
<v Speaker 1>It works here.</v>

230
00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:40.820
<v Speaker 1>I've got a picture of homeboy,</v>

231
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:42.770
<v Speaker 1>he said a long ponytail.</v>

232
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:43.170
<v Speaker 1>Is that going?</v>

233
00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:43.461
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

234
00:06:43.461 --> 00:06:43.900
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

235
00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:44.390
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

236
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:46.080
<v Speaker 1>He went the dreadlock routes.</v>

237
00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:51.560
<v Speaker 1>It just takes one guy to have like tried to put a bomb in his hair piece too.</v>

238
00:06:51.561 --> 00:06:54.020
<v Speaker 1>We have like a line where everyone has to get there like two pays,</v>

239
00:06:54.021 --> 00:06:55.640
<v Speaker 1>like shoveled off or scraped.</v>

240
00:06:55.641 --> 00:06:59.030
<v Speaker 1>Well there's not enough people that have big hair like that where you would have</v>

241
00:06:59.031 --> 00:07:00.320
<v Speaker 1>to like look into it.</v>

242
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:01.161
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

243
00:07:01.161 --> 00:07:01.340
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

244
00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:01.760
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

245
00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:02.511
<v Speaker 1>if people,</v>

246
00:07:02.511 --> 00:07:04.550
<v Speaker 1>if there was a lot of people running around with a hair like that,</v>

247
00:07:04.551 --> 00:07:05.810
<v Speaker 1>they would start searching your hair.</v>

248
00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:09.800
<v Speaker 1>I definitely 100% but those radio wave things that they go through,</v>

249
00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:12.200
<v Speaker 1>here's how I'm boy see his hair.</v>

250
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:14.000
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

251
00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:14.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

252
00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:15.920
<v Speaker 1>It goes all the way down to his ass.</v>

253
00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:17.120
<v Speaker 1>His ass,</v>

254
00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:17.571
<v Speaker 1>excuse me.</v>

255
00:07:17.571 --> 00:07:18.830
<v Speaker 1>Almost down to his knees.</v>

256
00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:20.150
<v Speaker 1>That shit's got to smell.</v>

257
00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:21.220
<v Speaker 1>It probably smells great.</v>

258
00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:22.910
<v Speaker 1>Pockets of nest in there.</v>

259
00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:25.820
<v Speaker 1>All kinds of living are art forms in there.</v>

260
00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:28.760
<v Speaker 1>Ebola spite.</v>

261
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:29.840
<v Speaker 1>The um,</v>

262
00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:31.550
<v Speaker 1>wasn't going to say,</v>

263
00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:31.731
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

264
00:07:31.731 --> 00:07:32.564
<v Speaker 1>but you keep,</v>

265
00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:34.070
<v Speaker 1>if that was fake,</v>

266
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:36.830
<v Speaker 1>like there's no way you could wear hair that long.</v>

267
00:07:36.831 --> 00:07:37.580
<v Speaker 1>That's fig.</v>

268
00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:40.070
<v Speaker 1>Cause now you weren't like some crazy costume or something.</v>

269
00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:44.600
<v Speaker 1>Like it has to be within the cultural norm and has to be like culturally</v>

270
00:07:44.601 --> 00:07:45.950
<v Speaker 1>acceptable length hair.</v>

271
00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:46.920
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

272
00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:47.280
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

273
00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:50.690
<v Speaker 1>like do you remember when that Guy Phil Spector was on trial for murder?</v>

274
00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:52.221
<v Speaker 1>That really crazy.</v>

275
00:07:52.221 --> 00:07:53.600
<v Speaker 1>Fuck Phil Spector,</v>

276
00:07:53.601 --> 00:07:56.480
<v Speaker 1>who Jamie probably knows who he is more than both of us.</v>

277
00:07:56.481 --> 00:07:57.314
<v Speaker 1>Cause he was,</v>

278
00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:58.520
<v Speaker 1>he had that thing,</v>

279
00:07:58.521 --> 00:08:01.070
<v Speaker 1>the wall of sound that he had kind of created.</v>

280
00:08:01.071 --> 00:08:03.680
<v Speaker 1>He cranked kind of created a new way of um,</v>

281
00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:04.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

282
00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:05.300
<v Speaker 1>producing music.</v>

283
00:08:05.301 --> 00:08:05.870
<v Speaker 1>Is that correct?</v>

284
00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:07.150
<v Speaker 1>That the best way to describe it.</v>

285
00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:08.800
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>

286
00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:09.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

287
00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:12.380
<v Speaker 1>But apparently he loved putting guns in people's faces.</v>

288
00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:16.560
<v Speaker 1>He was just a fucking nut and he showed up for trial.</v>

289
00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:17.513
<v Speaker 1>Look at that one.</v>

290
00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:22.540
<v Speaker 1>Look at that wig like he showed up for trial wherein the different wigs,</v>

291
00:08:22.941 --> 00:08:23.241
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

292
00:08:23.241 --> 00:08:24.800
<v Speaker 1>Didn't you wear a couple different kinds?</v>

293
00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:26.070
<v Speaker 1>He wore it.</v>

294
00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:27.283
<v Speaker 1>Just that one.</v>

295
00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:27.921
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

296
00:08:27.921 --> 00:08:28.720
<v Speaker 1>What about that one?</v>

297
00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:29.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

298
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:30.680
<v Speaker 1>So he's got two different wigs.</v>

299
00:08:30.681 --> 00:08:31.514
<v Speaker 1>At least.</v>

300
00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:33.470
<v Speaker 1>What ended up happening to him?</v>

301
00:08:33.471 --> 00:08:33.980
<v Speaker 1>Is he in jail?</v>

302
00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:34.581
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

303
00:08:34.581 --> 00:08:35.210
<v Speaker 1>He's in jail.</v>

304
00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:36.230
<v Speaker 1>He might be dead.</v>

305
00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:37.430
<v Speaker 1>He might be dead now.</v>

306
00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:38.413
<v Speaker 1>Look how,</v>

307
00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:39.170
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

308
00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:41.690
<v Speaker 1>look how horrific he looks.</v>

309
00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:44.690
<v Speaker 1>He just looks so creepy.</v>

310
00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.490
<v Speaker 1>Is that him there smiling too?</v>

311
00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:48.710
<v Speaker 1>While it looks like a totally different person when he smiles.</v>

312
00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:50.750
<v Speaker 1>That's so odd.</v>

313
00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:51.973
<v Speaker 1>Oof.</v>

314
00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:53.390
<v Speaker 1>He's a creepy dude.</v>

315
00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:54.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

316
00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:54.351
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

317
00:08:54.351 --> 00:08:55.110
<v Speaker 1>so he,</v>

318
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:55.830
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

319
00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:58.050
<v Speaker 1>he put a gun in some girl's mouth,</v>

320
00:08:58.650 --> 00:08:58.981
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

321
00:08:58.981 --> 00:09:01.020
<v Speaker 1>he was into that kind of shit like,</v>

322
00:09:01.021 --> 00:09:01.321
<v Speaker 1>bitch,</v>

323
00:09:01.321 --> 00:09:02.100
<v Speaker 1>I'll fucking kill you.</v>

324
00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:03.390
<v Speaker 1>And he actually did kill her.</v>

325
00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:04.283
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

326
00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:05.123
<v Speaker 1>And she was like a,</v>

327
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:07.080
<v Speaker 1>just a young lady.</v>

328
00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:08.200
<v Speaker 1>I think that's her up there.</v>

329
00:09:08.201 --> 00:09:09.270
<v Speaker 1>Atlanta Clarkson.</v>

330
00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:09.991
<v Speaker 1>That's her.</v>

331
00:09:09.991 --> 00:09:10.500
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

332
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:11.460
<v Speaker 1>She was really pretty,</v>

333
00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:12.660
<v Speaker 1>oh shit.</v>

334
00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:16.350
<v Speaker 1>That she had done some ma acting and stuff and she met him.</v>

335
00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:21.420
<v Speaker 1>What's amazing to me was not just that he shot her and that this crazy fuck</v>

336
00:09:21.421 --> 00:09:21.630
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

337
00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:25.050
<v Speaker 1>but that an ugly dude like that can bang a chick that looks that hot.</v>

338
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:27.990
<v Speaker 1>Like how did he get her?</v>

339
00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:28.840
<v Speaker 1>Maybe,</v>

340
00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:30.510
<v Speaker 1>maybe she wouldn't have sex with them.</v>

341
00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:32.880
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's why I shot her in the mouth.</v>

342
00:09:32.881 --> 00:09:32.990
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

343
00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:33.960
<v Speaker 1>he's awesome millionaire,</v>

344
00:09:33.961 --> 00:09:34.890
<v Speaker 1>I think at that point,</v>

345
00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:36.090
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

346
00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:36.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

347
00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:36.811
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

348
00:09:36.811 --> 00:09:37.920
<v Speaker 1>that definitely has got to help.</v>

349
00:09:37.921 --> 00:09:38.161
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

350
00:09:38.161 --> 00:09:38.380
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

351
00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:40.950
<v Speaker 1>but isn't an amazing that it helps that much.</v>

352
00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:41.461
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

353
00:09:41.461 --> 00:09:42.990
<v Speaker 1>look how scary he is.</v>

354
00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:45.700
<v Speaker 1>Is that Al Pachino?</v>

355
00:09:45.701 --> 00:09:49.870
<v Speaker 1>Did Al Chino play him in a movie Hbo Movie?</v>

356
00:09:49.871 --> 00:09:51.010
<v Speaker 1>I think really?</v>

357
00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:52.340
<v Speaker 1>What was it called?</v>

358
00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:55.083
<v Speaker 1>No Shit.</v>

359
00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:58.320
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know about that either.</v>

360
00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.370
<v Speaker 1>There's too many movies.</v>

361
00:09:59.371 --> 00:10:00.540
<v Speaker 1>So it just caught Phil Spector.</v>

362
00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:03.570
<v Speaker 1>Do you know I had a revelation the other day when it came to movies.</v>

363
00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:04.500
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

364
00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:05.490
<v Speaker 1>I went to see the Martian.</v>

365
00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:06.840
<v Speaker 1>It was pretty good.</v>

366
00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:08.550
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

367
00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:09.210
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>

368
00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:10.043
<v Speaker 1>problem is,</v>

369
00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:12.000
<v Speaker 1>the problem with that movie is,</v>

370
00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:12.691
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

371
00:10:12.691 --> 00:10:13.524
<v Speaker 1>he's going to live,</v>

372
00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:14.041
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

373
00:10:14.041 --> 00:10:17.400
<v Speaker 1>he's gonna make it so it's like someone gave you a spoiler alert before you even</v>

374
00:10:17.401 --> 00:10:18.234
<v Speaker 1>got to the movie.</v>

375
00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:18.990
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

376
00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:19.321
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

377
00:10:19.321 --> 00:10:20.610
<v Speaker 1>is he going to die on Mars?</v>

378
00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:24.270
<v Speaker 1>Am I paying money to watch two hours of him and he's going to die on Mars?</v>

379
00:10:24.271 --> 00:10:25.051
<v Speaker 1>Get the fuck Outta here.</v>

380
00:10:25.051 --> 00:10:26.940
<v Speaker 1>Everybody knows he's not going to die on Mars.</v>

381
00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:30.960
<v Speaker 1>But the revelation was there's,</v>

382
00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:35.280
<v Speaker 1>there's too many movies and like even really awesome movies,</v>

383
00:10:35.281 --> 00:10:40.281
<v Speaker 1>like sicario supposed to be pretty bad ass because that's the new Benicio Del</v>

384
00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:41.011
<v Speaker 1>Toro movie.</v>

385
00:10:41.011 --> 00:10:42.000
<v Speaker 1>It's supposed to be pretty bad ass,</v>

386
00:10:42.001 --> 00:10:43.380
<v Speaker 1>but we couldn't get a ticket to that one.</v>

387
00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:44.280
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

388
00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:45.113
<v Speaker 1>in time,</v>

389
00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

390
00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:46.371
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

391
00:10:46.371 --> 00:10:48.330
<v Speaker 1>we were sold out so we went with the Martian.</v>

392
00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:49.020
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

393
00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:54.020
<v Speaker 1>but the point is these movies never stop every week there's new ones and they</v>

394
00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:55.590
<v Speaker 1>don't go away.</v>

395
00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:59.790
<v Speaker 1>Like the old ones don't stop being around like you can go watch them too.</v>

396
00:10:59.791 --> 00:11:01.050
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's too many of them.</v>

397
00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:05.760
<v Speaker 1>Like I was thinking about all the different movies just on iTunes and Netflix</v>

398
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.460
<v Speaker 1>and I was scrolling through them and I started thinking like this is an,</v>

399
00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:10.980
<v Speaker 1>this is a never ending equation.</v>

400
00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:13.170
<v Speaker 1>Like it just keeps getting tacked onto it.</v>

401
00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:16.350
<v Speaker 1>We live in the epicenter of where it's created.</v>

402
00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:18.480
<v Speaker 1>It's all around here and it's,</v>

403
00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:22.260
<v Speaker 1>it's very strange because the body of work just never stops.</v>

404
00:11:22.261 --> 00:11:24.570
<v Speaker 1>Like he used to be when I was a kid.</v>

405
00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:26.760
<v Speaker 1>When a good movie came out,</v>

406
00:11:26.761 --> 00:11:28.410
<v Speaker 1>you would go to see that fucking movie.</v>

407
00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:29.460
<v Speaker 1>Like Star Wars.</v>

408
00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:34.670
<v Speaker 1>I saw star wars 13 times and I was nothing compared to the real geeks.</v>

409
00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:36.800
<v Speaker 1>Like there's,</v>

410
00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:37.633
<v Speaker 1>there was like,</v>

411
00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:41.580
<v Speaker 1>it was a big deal back then to see how many times you could see a movie.</v>

412
00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:46.020
<v Speaker 1>Like you couldn't run a movie long enough to see for someone to see it 13 times</v>

413
00:11:46.021 --> 00:11:48.360
<v Speaker 1>now because there's new ones,</v>

414
00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:50.070
<v Speaker 1>there's new ones come in.</v>

415
00:11:50.071 --> 00:11:52.350
<v Speaker 1>We've got to get this fucking piece of shit out of the theater.</v>

416
00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.070
<v Speaker 1>You would never have a movie like star wars.</v>

417
00:11:54.071 --> 00:11:56.650
<v Speaker 1>It played over and over and over and over and over and over again.</v>

418
00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:59.110
<v Speaker 1>And if star wars came out today,</v>

419
00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:01.900
<v Speaker 1>people would shit right in its mouth.</v>

420
00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:03.850
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

421
00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:04.750
<v Speaker 1>it's weird.</v>

422
00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:05.770
<v Speaker 1>That is to me,</v>

423
00:12:05.771 --> 00:12:06.760
<v Speaker 1>in my childhood,</v>

424
00:12:06.761 --> 00:12:10.900
<v Speaker 1>one of the greatest movies of all time when I was a kid and that movie came out,</v>

425
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:15.490
<v Speaker 1>I remember when Obi wan Kenobi was talking to Luke Skywalker and,</v>

426
00:12:15.491 --> 00:12:15.551
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

427
00:12:15.551 --> 00:12:16.750
<v Speaker 1>they were in the sand.</v>

428
00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:17.080
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

429
00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:20.410
<v Speaker 1>this is the greatest thing I've ever seen in my life.</v>

430
00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:21.820
<v Speaker 1>This is amazing.</v>

431
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.960
<v Speaker 1>This guy's in space and he's gonna Obi wan Kenobi is going to teach them how to</v>

432
00:12:25.961 --> 00:12:26.621
<v Speaker 1>be a jet.</v>

433
00:12:26.621 --> 00:12:27.040
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

434
00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:27.641
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

435
00:12:27.641 --> 00:12:28.920
<v Speaker 1>this is the greatest wound we have.</v>

436
00:12:28.921 --> 00:12:29.560
<v Speaker 1>Our,</v>

437
00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:31.270
<v Speaker 1>I remember it couldn't have been more perfect.</v>

438
00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:32.920
<v Speaker 1>I remember seeing that movie and thinking,</v>

439
00:12:32.921 --> 00:12:34.870
<v Speaker 1>this movie is fucking perfect.</v>

440
00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:36.550
<v Speaker 1>Now you go watch and you're like,</v>

441
00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:37.241
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

442
00:12:37.241 --> 00:12:38.830
<v Speaker 1>it's such a clunky Turd.</v>

443
00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:40.390
<v Speaker 1>It's clunky.</v>

444
00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:42.340
<v Speaker 1>The special effects look like shit.</v>

445
00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:43.680
<v Speaker 1>Why is Darth Vader evil?</v>

446
00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:43.980
<v Speaker 1>Does he,</v>

447
00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:45.760
<v Speaker 1>does he just not even a reason why he's evil?</v>

448
00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:46.750
<v Speaker 1>He's just evil.</v>

449
00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:50.320
<v Speaker 1>What does he get when he takes over the world is even get pussy is even going to</v>

450
00:12:50.321 --> 00:12:51.400
<v Speaker 1>get any pussy in space.</v>

451
00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:55.480
<v Speaker 1>He know he's just building some giant star that can blow up planets.</v>

452
00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:56.463
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

453
00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:57.700
<v Speaker 1>This is so dumb.</v>

454
00:12:57.940 --> 00:12:58.810
<v Speaker 1>Like it's so dumb.</v>

455
00:12:58.900 --> 00:12:59.151
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

456
00:12:59.151 --> 00:13:00.370
<v Speaker 1>it uses the dark side.</v>

457
00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:01.121
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

458
00:13:01.121 --> 00:13:02.110
<v Speaker 1>not the dark side.</v>

459
00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:04.960
<v Speaker 1>It's so fucking dumb and it's puppets.</v>

460
00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:08.410
<v Speaker 1>It's like Kermit the frog and the Skywalker in its day.</v>

461
00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:10.840
<v Speaker 1>Like if you judge it in the context of its day,</v>

462
00:13:10.841 --> 00:13:12.940
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the all time classic films.</v>

463
00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:14.291
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

464
00:13:14.291 --> 00:13:16.750
<v Speaker 1>there's so many more now and they're better.</v>

465
00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:21.310
<v Speaker 1>There's some films from back then that still like apocalypse now is a rock</v>

466
00:13:21.311 --> 00:13:22.144
<v Speaker 1>solid.</v>

467
00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:23.650
<v Speaker 1>You try to go watch apocalypse now.</v>

468
00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:26.290
<v Speaker 1>It is rock fucking solid.</v>

469
00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:29.920
<v Speaker 1>Francis Ford Coppola just made a masterpiece.</v>

470
00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:30.521
<v Speaker 1>That's who did that,</v>

471
00:13:30.521 --> 00:13:30.790
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

472
00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:31.121
<v Speaker 1>It was him,</v>

473
00:13:31.121 --> 00:13:31.954
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

474
00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:32.863
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

475
00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:33.450
<v Speaker 1>Some,</v>

476
00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:34.720
<v Speaker 1>it's a masterpiece.</v>

477
00:13:34.721 --> 00:13:35.740
<v Speaker 1>It's a masterpiece.</v>

478
00:13:35.741 --> 00:13:38.320
<v Speaker 1>It's like a flaw was film and it's a film that took,</v>

479
00:13:38.321 --> 00:13:41.680
<v Speaker 1>I think it took like seven years to make and went way,</v>

480
00:13:41.681 --> 00:13:42.670
<v Speaker 1>way over budget.</v>

481
00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:46.750
<v Speaker 1>They started with Laurence Fishburne when he was like 17 years and in that</v>

482
00:13:46.751 --> 00:13:47.584
<v Speaker 1>movie,</v>

483
00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:49.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean that was a crazy fucking movie,</v>

484
00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:51.040
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

485
00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:51.580
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

486
00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:52.870
<v Speaker 1>it's a movie that holds up,</v>

487
00:13:52.871 --> 00:13:53.260
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

488
00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:54.280
<v Speaker 1>It still holds up.</v>

489
00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:55.983
<v Speaker 1>Ghostbusters.</v>

490
00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:56.873
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't hold up.</v>

491
00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:58.240
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't hold up.</v>

492
00:13:58.270 --> 00:13:59.920
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot that happened watching and going.</v>

493
00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:00.530
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

494
00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:01.060
<v Speaker 1>we were,</v>

495
00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:01.960
<v Speaker 1>we were kids though,</v>

496
00:14:01.961 --> 00:14:02.620
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

497
00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:02.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

498
00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:03.761
<v Speaker 1>we were younger,</v>

499
00:14:03.761 --> 00:14:04.320
<v Speaker 1>but we were,</v>

500
00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:06.070
<v Speaker 1>it was just looked real back then.</v>

501
00:14:06.071 --> 00:14:07.740
<v Speaker 1>That was like realistic too,</v>

502
00:14:07.741 --> 00:14:08.260
<v Speaker 1>is you know,</v>

503
00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:09.820
<v Speaker 1>those monsters made out of clay.</v>

504
00:14:09.821 --> 00:14:10.130
<v Speaker 1>We're like,</v>

505
00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:10.480
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

506
00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:11.740
<v Speaker 1>it's a monster man out of clay.</v>

507
00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:14.410
<v Speaker 1>I remember I used to like land of the lost.</v>

508
00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:14.741
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

509
00:14:14.741 --> 00:14:15.870
<v Speaker 1>the sleaze tax.</v>

510
00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:16.890
<v Speaker 1>There are fun.</v>

511
00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:17.651
<v Speaker 1>So cool.</v>

512
00:14:17.651 --> 00:14:19.150
<v Speaker 1>Look and Ooh,</v>

513
00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:20.073
<v Speaker 1>excited.</v>

514
00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:22.300
<v Speaker 1>Godzilla King Kong movie coming out.</v>

515
00:14:22.301 --> 00:14:23.320
<v Speaker 1>Oh Christ.</v>

516
00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:24.161
<v Speaker 1>Here's why.</v>

517
00:14:24.161 --> 00:14:24.994
<v Speaker 1>That's stupid.</v>

518
00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:25.900
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

519
00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:27.730
<v Speaker 1>Godzilla is 500 feet tall.</v>

520
00:14:27.731 --> 00:14:29.140
<v Speaker 1>King Kong's 50 feet tall.</v>

521
00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:30.490
<v Speaker 1>Did you stop?</v>

522
00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:32.410
<v Speaker 1>Does Japanese people fucked you?</v>

523
00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:35.980
<v Speaker 1>They fucked you with those movies because they violated all the laws.</v>

524
00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:40.750
<v Speaker 1>They didn't give you some reason why King Kong grew to 500.</v>

525
00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:43.210
<v Speaker 1>He grew 450 extra fee.</v>

526
00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:44.440
<v Speaker 1>They didn't say a word about it.</v>

527
00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:45.820
<v Speaker 1>Come on man.</v>

528
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:46.990
<v Speaker 1>How's he so big?</v>

529
00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:47.580
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>

530
00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:48.070
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

531
00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:51.470
<v Speaker 1>he used to be able to climb shit and he would carry the chicken his hand and now</v>

532
00:14:51.471 --> 00:14:53.060
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden he's as big as Godzilla.</v>

533
00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:55.610
<v Speaker 1>What if it was baby Godzilla versus King Kong?</v>

534
00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:57.230
<v Speaker 1>Like it was just baby Godzilla.</v>

535
00:14:57.330 --> 00:14:58.163
<v Speaker 1>He was small.</v>

536
00:14:58.190 --> 00:14:59.930
<v Speaker 1>Don't make a little bit more sense.</v>

537
00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:00.380
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

538
00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:02.090
<v Speaker 1>But he would just stand back and light them on fire.</v>

539
00:15:02.091 --> 00:15:03.050
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking stupid.</v>

540
00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:05.540
<v Speaker 1>Fight will take 30 seconds.</v>

541
00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:06.111
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

542
00:15:06.111 --> 00:15:08.000
<v Speaker 1>to get killed by little tiny airplanes.</v>

543
00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:09.650
<v Speaker 1>He got killed by airplanes.</v>

544
00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:13.370
<v Speaker 1>And if you know anything about like firepower and guns,</v>

545
00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:18.550
<v Speaker 1>the idea that you could kill a gorilla with these little piss ant bullets from</v>

546
00:15:18.621 --> 00:15:18.771
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

547
00:15:18.771 --> 00:15:19.310
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

548
00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:19.580
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

549
00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:21.790
<v Speaker 1>a tiny little stupid cardboard plane.</v>

550
00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:27.050
<v Speaker 1>There's there that you're killing a gorilla that's so fucking big that it can</v>

551
00:15:27.831 --> 00:15:30.800
<v Speaker 1>carry people and climbed to the top of the empire state building.</v>

552
00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:34.820
<v Speaker 1>He can grab planes out of the air and smashed them.</v>

553
00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:35.960
<v Speaker 1>Remember it was doing that,</v>

554
00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:38.810
<v Speaker 1>but yet those little baby bullets are killing them.</v>

555
00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:43.220
<v Speaker 1>Those little baby bolts would just make him furious unless they were like the</v>

556
00:15:43.221 --> 00:15:46.010
<v Speaker 1>hollow points or something like that where they blew up inside of him.</v>

557
00:15:46.011 --> 00:15:46.844
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>

558
00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:48.470
<v Speaker 1>Unless they were cannons,</v>

559
00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:49.333
<v Speaker 1>they would have to be like,</v>

560
00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:54.080
<v Speaker 1>they don't have to be such of a such a high caliber that it would be like boom,</v>

561
00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:55.133
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>

562
00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:57.470
<v Speaker 1>They would be mad fucking recoil.</v>

563
00:15:57.471 --> 00:15:58.780
<v Speaker 1>It would be me.</v>

564
00:15:58.910 --> 00:16:00.740
<v Speaker 1>Especially back then they figured it.</v>

565
00:16:00.741 --> 00:16:01.820
<v Speaker 1>They have guns now that I have,</v>

566
00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:03.100
<v Speaker 1>they're like a,</v>

567
00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:06.410
<v Speaker 1>Donald's Serone had one that he put a video of it on his Instagram.</v>

568
00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:06.861
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

569
00:16:06.861 --> 00:16:09.260
<v Speaker 1>I think they call it integrally suppressed,</v>

570
00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:11.090
<v Speaker 1>so when you fire the gun,</v>

571
00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:12.830
<v Speaker 1>it's a 300 win mag,</v>

572
00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:14.900
<v Speaker 1>which is a big round.</v>

573
00:16:14.901 --> 00:16:16.520
<v Speaker 1>It's a very powerful rifle.</v>

574
00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:17.271
<v Speaker 1>When you fired,</v>

575
00:16:17.271 --> 00:16:19.430
<v Speaker 1>it's like Tunc Tunc like nothing.</v>

576
00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:21.320
<v Speaker 1>You don't feel anything and you don't hear anything.</v>

577
00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:24.680
<v Speaker 1>It's like a very small amount of sound and a very small amount of kick.</v>

578
00:16:24.681 --> 00:16:24.831
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

579
00:16:24.831 --> 00:16:26.870
<v Speaker 1>he has a girl on his Instagram picture,</v>

580
00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:30.770
<v Speaker 1>just a regular sized girl shooting it and it's not fucking her up at all,</v>

581
00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:33.170
<v Speaker 1>but it should be like at least a struggle,</v>

582
00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:34.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

583
00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:34.580
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

584
00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:37.370
<v Speaker 1>but back then they didn't have any of that shit back then.</v>

585
00:16:37.371 --> 00:16:40.760
<v Speaker 1>It was just like an explosion and the metal tube shooting out a piece of lead.</v>

586
00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:44.900
<v Speaker 1>The idea that you're going to kill this big gorilla with your piss ass guns.</v>

587
00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:46.970
<v Speaker 1>He's going to fuck you up man.</v>

588
00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:48.290
<v Speaker 1>And he's going to bang that white chick.</v>

589
00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:49.431
<v Speaker 1>That's what he's there for.</v>

590
00:16:49.431 --> 00:16:49.601
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

591
00:16:49.601 --> 00:16:50.850
<v Speaker 1>they got smart and you know,</v>

592
00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:53.960
<v Speaker 1>it was just all like hacking and like nuclear war.</v>

593
00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:56.510
<v Speaker 1>Like God's Zelle is using computers now and King Kong.</v>

594
00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:58.333
<v Speaker 1>Nevermind.</v>

595
00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:01.100
<v Speaker 1>Where were you going with that?</v>

596
00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:02.930
<v Speaker 1>You committed to it too.</v>

597
00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:06.380
<v Speaker 1>It made it a drama drama.</v>

598
00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:07.581
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

599
00:17:07.581 --> 00:17:07.741
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

600
00:17:07.741 --> 00:17:08.660
<v Speaker 1>the last God,</v>

601
00:17:08.661 --> 00:17:11.360
<v Speaker 1>Zillow looked like it was going to be bad ass.</v>

602
00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:12.583
<v Speaker 1>I never watched it.</v>

603
00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:13.543
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't good.</v>

604
00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:15.290
<v Speaker 1>It was kind of fun.</v>

605
00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:16.171
<v Speaker 1>Like a,</v>

606
00:17:16.171 --> 00:17:20.540
<v Speaker 1>the Godzilla monster itself was fucking Badass.</v>

607
00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:22.820
<v Speaker 1>Like they did an amazing job with CGI,</v>

608
00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:23.931
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

609
00:17:23.931 --> 00:17:24.560
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

610
00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:29.560
<v Speaker 1>the story was so clunky and this fucking kid who's the hero keeps surviving.</v>

611
00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:30.981
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

612
00:17:30.981 --> 00:17:32.540
<v Speaker 1>he survived the most ridiculous shit.</v>

613
00:17:32.541 --> 00:17:37.250
<v Speaker 1>Like a plane fell off a or a train fell off of a giant bridge into the water and</v>

614
00:17:37.251 --> 00:17:39.680
<v Speaker 1>he gets out of there like over and over and over again.</v>

615
00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:40.580
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't that what happened,</v>

616
00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:43.820
<v Speaker 1>some stupid shit like that over and over and over again.</v>

617
00:17:43.821 --> 00:17:46.100
<v Speaker 1>This fuck survives the most ridiculous,</v>

618
00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:50.040
<v Speaker 1>preposterous disaster scenarios to watch Godzilla kill</v>

619
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:50.611
<v Speaker 3>this bad guy.</v>

620
00:17:50.611 --> 00:17:51.840
<v Speaker 3>And the spoiler alert,</v>

621
00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:54.450
<v Speaker 3>Godzilla survives spoiler.</v>

622
00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:58.620
<v Speaker 3>But it's just the special effects were pretty wicked.</v>

623
00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:01.740
<v Speaker 3>But the story itself was just clunky.</v>

624
00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:03.900
<v Speaker 3>Did you see a movie called the guest?</v>

625
00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:05.580
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>

626
00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:06.413
<v Speaker 3>Who's in it?</v>

627
00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:07.100
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

628
00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:08.240

629
00:18:08.241 --> 00:18:08.920
<v Speaker 2>I was not,</v>

630

<v Speaker 2>I don't know that is.</v>

638
00:18:18.501 --> 00:18:18.981
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>

639
00:18:18.981 --> 00:18:21.020
<v Speaker 2>it got really good on rotten tomatoes.</v>

640
00:18:21.021 --> 00:18:22.670
<v Speaker 2>I got like 92%.</v>

641
00:18:22.671 --> 00:18:22.971
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

642
00:18:22.971 --> 00:18:24.200
<v Speaker 2>like it got really good reviews.</v>

643
00:18:24.201 --> 00:18:25.820
<v Speaker 2>Doug Benson told me to watch it.</v>

644
00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:27.590
<v Speaker 2>It's on Netflix right now.</v>

645
00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:29.880
<v Speaker 2>It starts off like a kid's like,</v>

646
00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:32.540
<v Speaker 2>like kids like summer or you spoiler alert.</v>

647

00:18:38.631 --> 00:18:39.500
<v Speaker 2>And this guy,</v>

656
00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:40.040
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>who just got out of the army comes visits.</v>

658
00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:47.540
<v Speaker 2>This family is one of the biggest road house type version movie.</v>

659
00:18:48.321 --> 00:18:49.610
<v Speaker 2>It starts off horrible,</v>

660
00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:51.920
<v Speaker 2>but then you wake up out of this coma,</v>

661
00:18:51.921 --> 00:18:52.131
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

662

664
00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:54.960
<v Speaker 2>And then it started like,</v>

665
00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:55.791
<v Speaker 2>I swear to God,</v>

666
00:18:55.791 --> 00:18:57.620
<v Speaker 2>I laughed so hard in this movie,</v>

667
00:18:57.860 --> 00:18:58.371
<v Speaker 2>like a cut,</v>

668
00:18:58.371 --> 00:19:00.200
<v Speaker 2>like a roadhouse accidentally.</v>

669
00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:02.330
<v Speaker 2>But then I go to Doug and I'm like,</v>

670
00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:02.961

<v Speaker 2>oh well you like,</v>

675
00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:09.650
<v Speaker 2>he liked it for real disease.</v>

676
00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:10.543
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

677
00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:15.080
<v Speaker 2>Doug Benson quite possibly might be the worst poster boy for wheat alive.</v>

678
00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:19.400
<v Speaker 2>I just did is getting Doug with high.</v>

679
00:19:19.401 --> 00:19:22.970
<v Speaker 2>And he would like ask a question and then I'd be like starting to answer.</v>

680
00:19:22.971 --> 00:19:23.241
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>

681
00:19:23.241 --> 00:19:23.450
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

682
00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:24.180
<v Speaker 2>what are you talking about?</v>

683
00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:26.830
<v Speaker 2>Like took completely forgot what it,</v>

684
00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:29.750
<v Speaker 2>well in his defense,</v>

685
00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:31.250
<v Speaker 2>listen to what you just said.</v>

686
00:19:31.251 --> 00:19:32.061
<v Speaker 2>30 seconds go.</v>

687
00:19:32.061 --> 00:19:35.660
<v Speaker 2>Well Godzilla hacking computers guide.</v>

688
00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:36.920
<v Speaker 2>Zillow was like a drama.</v>

689
00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:38.630
<v Speaker 2>Like if they like it made it a drama.</v>

690
00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:41.840
<v Speaker 2>King Kong was hacking Godzilla and made it like a,</v>

691
00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:46.260
<v Speaker 3>what was that picture of view?</v>

692
00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:47.490
<v Speaker 3>But this uh,</v>

693
00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:50.760
<v Speaker 3>this idea that Doug Benson smokes too much pot.</v>

694
00:19:50.761 --> 00:19:54.960
<v Speaker 3>We should explore this cause I know he enjoys the marijuana and I know he's been</v>

695
00:19:54.961 --> 00:19:55.410
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

696
00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:57.930
<v Speaker 3>an activist and letting people know,</v>

697
00:19:57.931 --> 00:20:01.650
<v Speaker 3>but this type of behavior is perhaps negative to the cause.</v>

698
00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:06.070
<v Speaker 2>He makes me a not so high.</v>

699
00:20:06.071 --> 00:20:06.904
<v Speaker 2>It's so funny.</v>

700
00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:09.940
<v Speaker 2>It's so high all the time and he gets visually high,</v>

701
00:20:09.941 --> 00:20:13.780
<v Speaker 2>which makes it so much more fun when it closes up like razor slits,</v>

702
00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:16.060
<v Speaker 2>he closes up like there's no ice in there.</v>

703
00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:16.931
<v Speaker 2>Where's your eyes,</v>

704
00:20:16.931 --> 00:20:17.320
<v Speaker 2>man?</v>

705
00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:18.400
<v Speaker 2>It's like you don't have any eyes.</v>

706
00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:18.611
<v Speaker 2>Dot.</v>

707
00:20:18.611 --> 00:20:20.500
<v Speaker 2>Merera if he was a pirate or something,</v>

708
00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:22.241
<v Speaker 2>I smoke pot.</v>

709
00:20:22.241 --> 00:20:23.170
<v Speaker 2>We have to get them a cane.</v>

710
00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:26.200
<v Speaker 2>We'd have to get them with those Wa blind canes.</v>

711
00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:27.490
<v Speaker 2>You have to give them a dog.</v>

712
00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:32.020
<v Speaker 2>That Ebola thing about the eyes though,</v>

713
00:20:32.021 --> 00:20:33.310
<v Speaker 2>that really freaked me out.</v>

714
00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:34.210
<v Speaker 2>I should,</v>

715
00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:37.030
<v Speaker 2>how should it bullet has been living in people's eyes.</v>

716
00:20:37.031 --> 00:20:38.890
<v Speaker 2>The guys that had a Bullock spitting,</v>

717
00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:39.880
<v Speaker 2>staying in his eyes,</v>

718
00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:41.830
<v Speaker 2>changing their eye colors from green,</v>

719
00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:43.450
<v Speaker 2>blue and getting,</v>

720
00:20:43.451 --> 00:20:46.900
<v Speaker 2>having blurry vision and then when he gets to checked his eyes are not as</v>

721
00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:47.980
<v Speaker 2>anymore than more</v>

722
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:51.520
<v Speaker 3>of like a most sure mushier version of this sugar and more.</v>

723
00:20:51.521 --> 00:20:51.910
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

724
00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:52.301
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

731
00:21:04.691 --> 00:21:05.111

740
00:21:19.751 --> 00:21:21.370

741
00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:22.313
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 3>he girls notice.</v>

744
00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:26.710
<v Speaker 3>I blame it all on the girls.</v>

745
00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:27.611
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

746

747
00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:31.510
<v Speaker 3>He started tripping out and stuff.</v>

748
00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:33.400
<v Speaker 3>What I've been trying to deal with myself,</v>

749
00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:34.010
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

750
00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:35.430
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you,</v>

751
00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:36.180
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

752
00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:37.120
<v Speaker 3>you have to be,</v>

753
00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:39.970
<v Speaker 3>you have to consider a couple things when you're talking about your eyes.</v>

754
00:21:39.971 --> 00:21:41.650
<v Speaker 3>You definitely don't have to think about Ebola,</v>

755
00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:44.500
<v Speaker 3>but you do have to think about taking care of your health.</v>

756
00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:46.510
<v Speaker 3>You don't take care of your health.</v>

757
00:21:46.511 --> 00:21:47.321
<v Speaker 3>And I've told you before,</v>

758
00:21:47.321 --> 00:21:48.310
<v Speaker 3>it freaks me out.</v>

759
00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:48.581
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

760
00:21:48.581 --> 00:21:51.220
<v Speaker 3>I've cut out things like boner pills recently and,</v>

761
00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:51.560
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

762
00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:52.900
<v Speaker 3>you definitely should cut out those.</v>

763
00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:53.261
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

764
00:21:53.261 --> 00:21:55.960
<v Speaker 3>they have Viagra and Cialis and stuff like that.</v>

765
00:21:55.961 --> 00:21:58.270
<v Speaker 3>And it's like scientifically proven.</v>

766
00:21:58.290 --> 00:21:58.451
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

767
00:21:58.451 --> 00:22:00.280
<v Speaker 3>you can adjust your dosage.</v>

768
00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:02.890
<v Speaker 3>You don't know what you're taking when you take those things.</v>

769
00:22:02.891 --> 00:22:04.750
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of times you aren't taking Cialis.</v>

770
00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:06.340
<v Speaker 3>You are taking Viagra.</v>

771
00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:06.591
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>

772
00:22:06.591 --> 00:22:08.870
<v Speaker 3>what's weird is Lamar Odom who just recently,</v>

773
00:22:08.871 --> 00:22:09.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

774
00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:11.300
<v Speaker 3>I went to the hospital for a,</v>

775
00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:12.590
<v Speaker 3>they found him at the bunny ranch.</v>

776
00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:16.570
<v Speaker 3>She had sits like supposedly cocaine around and uh,</v>

777
00:22:16.571 --> 00:22:17.290
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

778
00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:18.130
<v Speaker 3>these boner pills,</v>

779
00:22:18.131 --> 00:22:18.791
<v Speaker 3>he's gas station,</v>

780
00:22:18.791 --> 00:22:19.624
<v Speaker 3>boner pills.</v>

781
00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:20.040
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

782
00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:21.250
<v Speaker 3>what's so weird about the whole thing,</v>

783
00:22:21.251 --> 00:22:22.660
<v Speaker 3>about two days before that happened,</v>

784
00:22:22.661 --> 00:22:25.600
<v Speaker 3>I found out they fda.gov Gov on their front page,</v>

785
00:22:25.601 --> 00:22:26.470
<v Speaker 3>if you go to it right now,</v>

786
00:22:26.471 --> 00:22:28.780
<v Speaker 3>has a whole thing about these boner pills.</v>

787
00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:33.280
<v Speaker 3>And they also have links to every single like boner pill that you can buy.</v>

788
00:22:33.281 --> 00:22:34.720
<v Speaker 3>Like I took all my wrap,</v>

789
00:22:34.721 --> 00:22:35.920
<v Speaker 3>I keep my rappers like,</v>

790
00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:37.631
<v Speaker 3>cause they come in and he's like,</v>

791
00:22:37.631 --> 00:22:39.750
<v Speaker 3>cardboard saved them like baseball cards.</v>

792
00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:42.520
<v Speaker 3>They're cool because they all have really good artwork and you know,</v>

793
00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:43.930
<v Speaker 3>so they need good artwork.</v>

794
00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:48.460
<v Speaker 3>It's just like David chose were the Mona Lisa on those things,</v>

795
00:22:48.461 --> 00:22:48.820
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

796
00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:50.620
<v Speaker 3>So I looked at my favorite one.</v>

797
00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:52.870
<v Speaker 3>My favorite one has viagara in it,</v>

798
00:22:52.871 --> 00:22:54.700
<v Speaker 3>the Mexican version of Viagra in it.</v>

799
00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:57.100
<v Speaker 3>But a lot of them also have steroids.</v>

800
00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:57.431
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

801
00:22:57.431 --> 00:22:58.510
<v Speaker 3>and if you can go through this,</v>

802
00:22:58.511 --> 00:23:00.010
<v Speaker 3>like this is the hidden agreement.</v>

803
00:23:00.011 --> 00:23:01.630
<v Speaker 3>Like a lot of them are steroids,</v>

804
00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:04.750
<v Speaker 3>a generic names for Viagra.</v>

805
00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:05.051
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

806
00:23:05.051 --> 00:23:05.321
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

807
00:23:05.321 --> 00:23:08.650
<v Speaker 3>that was Anderson Silva's excuse when he tested positive for steroids.</v>

808
00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:09.960
<v Speaker 3>That makes totally sense.</v>

809
00:23:09.970 --> 00:23:13.090
<v Speaker 3>He took a Chinese Viagra and,</v>

810
00:23:13.091 --> 00:23:14.440
<v Speaker 3>but what they think is,</v>

811
00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:16.300
<v Speaker 3>this is actually one way,</v>

812
00:23:16.301 --> 00:23:17.610
<v Speaker 3>it could be what,</v>

813
00:23:17.611 --> 00:23:18.161
<v Speaker 3>what had happened,</v>

814
00:23:18.161 --> 00:23:18.521
<v Speaker 3>what he said,</v>

815
00:23:18.521 --> 00:23:21.050
<v Speaker 3>could it be true that he might've gotten some sort of a,</v>

816
00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:22.300
<v Speaker 3>it might've called it Viagara,</v>

817
00:23:22.301 --> 00:23:25.390
<v Speaker 3>but it might've been like some super strong boner pill that also has steroids in</v>

818
00:23:25.391 --> 00:23:26.080
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

819
00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:26.913
<v Speaker 3>But the other,</v>

820
00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:32.200
<v Speaker 3>what they were thinking is that with a company that makes this Viagra or Cialis</v>

821
00:23:32.201 --> 00:23:32.531
<v Speaker 3>or whatever,</v>

822
00:23:32.531 --> 00:23:36.040
<v Speaker 3>it was also make steroids and they just didn't clean their batch and some of it</v>

823
00:23:36.041 --> 00:23:36.910
<v Speaker 3>got contaminated,</v>

824
00:23:36.911 --> 00:23:37.990
<v Speaker 3>which does happen.</v>

825
00:23:38.170 --> 00:23:39.130
<v Speaker 3>We've actually,</v>

826
00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:39.880
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

827
00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:40.271
<v Speaker 3>we've,</v>

828
00:23:40.271 --> 00:23:43.330
<v Speaker 3>we've run tests on different supplements that we have like,</v>

829
00:23:43.331 --> 00:23:43.840
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

830
00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:44.890
<v Speaker 3>a Alpha brain.</v>

831
00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:47.360
<v Speaker 3>And during the early days</v>

832
00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:49.100
<v Speaker 4>when we first started doing it,</v>

833
00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:54.380
<v Speaker 4>we would notice that there would be a certain inconsistency in,</v>

834
00:23:54.410 --> 00:23:55.010
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

835
00:23:55.010 --> 00:23:57.050
<v Speaker 4>in like the amount of something.</v>

836
00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:00.470
<v Speaker 4>It was just like minor,</v>

837
00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:01.610
<v Speaker 4>but enough to we'll guy.</v>

838
00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:02.240
<v Speaker 4>Hmm.</v>

839
00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:04.220
<v Speaker 4>And then occasionally we would find something,</v>

840
00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:05.150
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

841
00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:06.080
<v Speaker 4>in a supplement.</v>

842
00:24:06.290 --> 00:24:07.330
<v Speaker 4>Like we never found it in,</v>

843
00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:09.890
<v Speaker 4>in a alpha brain or true mood or something like that.</v>

844
00:24:09.891 --> 00:24:11.510
<v Speaker 4>But I know they've found it in like,</v>

845
00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:14.870
<v Speaker 4>well you get like a B 12 supplement and it has vitamin A in it.</v>

846
00:24:14.871 --> 00:24:15.980
<v Speaker 4>For some reason it never was like,</v>

847
00:24:15.981 --> 00:24:16.940
<v Speaker 4>well how'd that get in there?</v>

848
00:24:17.150 --> 00:24:17.600
<v Speaker 4>Or You have,</v>

849
00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:20.540
<v Speaker 4>cause you're getting your stuff from like bulk.</v>

850
00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:23.570
<v Speaker 4>You're getting it from a lot of people are getting with if they're getting like</v>

851
00:24:23.571 --> 00:24:25.430
<v Speaker 4>Tribulus I know used to buy that stuff.</v>

852
00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:26.030
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

853
00:24:26.030 --> 00:24:27.310
<v Speaker 4>Well if you're getting vitamins you,</v>

854
00:24:27.311 --> 00:24:29.020
<v Speaker 4>you're getting them from these bulk supplies.</v>

855
00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:32.000
<v Speaker 4>Like my friend Larry used to run that vitamin company and when you get stuff</v>

856
00:24:32.001 --> 00:24:33.320
<v Speaker 4>from bulk suppliers,</v>

857
00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:34.960
<v Speaker 4>like a lot of times they,</v>

858
00:24:34.961 --> 00:24:39.200
<v Speaker 4>they're mixing their stuff in these vats and they just don't clean them.</v>

859
00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:40.700
<v Speaker 4>They do a shitty job of cleaning them.</v>

860
00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:42.920
<v Speaker 4>Most of the time you're okay.</v>

861
00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:44.120
<v Speaker 4>But if,</v>

862
00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:47.050
<v Speaker 4>if someone fucks up and doesn't do their job or you,</v>

863
00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:50.750
<v Speaker 4>you deal with some low level company that doesn't take care of their shit,</v>

864
00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:52.250
<v Speaker 4>you definitely,</v>

865
00:24:52.251 --> 00:24:52.791
<v Speaker 4>definitely,</v>

866
00:24:52.791 --> 00:24:57.230
<v Speaker 4>definitely can get steroids and things along those lines inside like protein</v>

867
00:24:57.231 --> 00:24:58.590
<v Speaker 4>powders and insides,</v>

868
00:24:58.970 --> 00:24:59.870
<v Speaker 4>muscle supplements.</v>

869
00:24:59.871 --> 00:25:00.704
<v Speaker 4>They shouldn't be there.</v>

870
00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:02.990
<v Speaker 4>But then there's also some of them,</v>

871
00:25:02.991 --> 00:25:04.610
<v Speaker 4>they just put steroids in there.</v>

872
00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:05.270
<v Speaker 4>You know why?</v>

873
00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:09.920
<v Speaker 4>Because steroids work so and you can get cheap Chinese steroids and you just</v>

874
00:25:09.921 --> 00:25:13.040
<v Speaker 4>throw them in your boner pills and you'll let want to fuck like a gorilla.</v>

875
00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:14.780
<v Speaker 4>Cause cause you're juiced up man,</v>

876
00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:18.530
<v Speaker 4>you actually on steroids and it will fuck with your mood.</v>

877
00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:20.720
<v Speaker 4>We had that Jeff Novitsky Guy,</v>

878
00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:24.920
<v Speaker 4>he's the guy who works for the u s antidoping agency and he's the guy busted</v>

879
00:25:24.921 --> 00:25:28.190
<v Speaker 4>Lance Armstrong and now he works for the UFC and he's,</v>

880
00:25:28.191 --> 00:25:28.610
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

881
00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:30.710
<v Speaker 4>doing all these crazy random drug test.</v>

882
00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:35.840
<v Speaker 4>He told us about all the different substances that the Olympic Committee and the</v>

883
00:25:35.841 --> 00:25:39.200
<v Speaker 4>FDA finds out test positive for steroids.</v>

884
00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:40.820
<v Speaker 4>And we're like well how many are there?</v>

885
00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:42.440
<v Speaker 4>So we go to the fucking website,</v>

886
00:25:42.441 --> 00:25:44.390
<v Speaker 4>there's a website where it lists each one of them.</v>

887
00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:46.670
<v Speaker 4>We didn't even get through the Aes,</v>

888
00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:50.750
<v Speaker 4>we were in the A's and there was hundreds of them that are just steroids.</v>

889
00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:52.670
<v Speaker 4>So when you're going into the the,</v>

890
00:25:52.890 --> 00:25:53.723
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

891
00:25:54.530 --> 00:25:56.960
<v Speaker 4>local vitamin Shoppe and you're seeing,</v>

892
00:25:56.961 --> 00:25:57.121
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

893
00:25:57.121 --> 00:26:00.680
<v Speaker 4>muscle build 5,000 some fucking guys shred it on it.</v>

894
00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:02.780
<v Speaker 4>A lot of those are steroids,</v>

895
00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:07.820
<v Speaker 4>especially more so back in the day than today because they're a little bit</v>

896
00:26:07.821 --> 00:26:11.000
<v Speaker 4>better at busting people and there's a little bit less people that are willing</v>

897
00:26:11.001 --> 00:26:15.200
<v Speaker 4>to take the chance of getting arrested or of getting sued or whatever.</v>

898
00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:17.660
<v Speaker 4>But there's a lot of that shit that's just,</v>

899
00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:21.830
<v Speaker 4>there's so much monkey business involved and like those kind of like muscle</v>

900
00:26:21.831 --> 00:26:22.670
<v Speaker 4>building things</v>

901
00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:28.010
<v Speaker 2>at whether it's really dangerous because all the ones I had were on the fda.gov</v>

902
00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:28.611
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

903
00:26:28.611 --> 00:26:32.030
<v Speaker 2>and so then I started taking each one of the boner pills and showing like</v>

904
00:26:32.031 --> 00:26:34.520
<v Speaker 2>looking at every single ingredient that was in it.</v>

905
00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:39.680
<v Speaker 2>A lot of them were roots and like mixing certain things with other things.</v>

906
00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:41.450
<v Speaker 2>Have net has never been tested.</v>

907
00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:42.530
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

908
00:26:42.530 --> 00:26:44.310
<v Speaker 2>like if you have low blood pressure,</v>

909
00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:46.710
<v Speaker 1>you could die off these boner pills just from,</v>

910
00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:49.760
<v Speaker 1>of you have a heart if you're on a heart medication.</v>

911
00:26:49.770 --> 00:26:50.130
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

912
00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:51.970
<v Speaker 1>Like old dudes that have um,</v>

913
00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:52.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

914
00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:53.131
<v Speaker 1>heart attacks.</v>

915
00:26:53.131 --> 00:26:56.010
<v Speaker 1>They have to take nitrates like nitroglycerine and stuff like that.</v>

916
00:26:56.250 --> 00:26:56.581
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>

917
00:26:56.581 --> 00:26:58.620
<v Speaker 1>if you take that like you ever seen those in those movies,</v>

918
00:26:58.621 --> 00:27:00.270
<v Speaker 1>the guy would almost be about to take a hard time.</v>

919
00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:02.100
<v Speaker 1>Then he popped those little pills and chew them up.</v>

920
00:27:02.101 --> 00:27:03.390
<v Speaker 1>He's got to get to my heart pills.</v>

921
00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:04.081
<v Speaker 1>You remember that?</v>

922
00:27:04.081 --> 00:27:04.920
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

923
00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:06.240
<v Speaker 1>It was always in those movies.</v>

924
00:27:06.241 --> 00:27:06.461
<v Speaker 1>Remember?</v>

925
00:27:06.461 --> 00:27:07.060
<v Speaker 1>That's real.</v>

926
00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:07.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

927
00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:07.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

928
00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:08.670
<v Speaker 1>That's real.</v>

929
00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:09.510
<v Speaker 1>There are um,</v>

930
00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:10.230
<v Speaker 1>certain,</v>

931
00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:10.411
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

932
00:27:10.411 --> 00:27:11.610
<v Speaker 1>I think it's Nitroglycerin,</v>

933
00:27:12.450 --> 00:27:17.450
<v Speaker 1>but certain things that you take that if you are on those and then you take</v>

934
00:27:17.671 --> 00:27:18.241
<v Speaker 1>Viagra,</v>

935
00:27:18.241 --> 00:27:20.280
<v Speaker 1>it can be super fucking dangerous for you.</v>

936
00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:24.600
<v Speaker 1>So these people are just taking them thinking that what's on that label is</v>

937
00:27:24.601 --> 00:27:25.590
<v Speaker 1>what's actually in it.</v>

938
00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:27.240
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times that's not the case.</v>

939
00:27:27.241 --> 00:27:27.781
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times.</v>

940
00:27:27.781 --> 00:27:29.100
<v Speaker 1>Just a bunch of extra shit in there.</v>

941
00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:29.760
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

942
00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:31.680
<v Speaker 1>the one that I recently have been taking,</v>

943
00:27:31.681 --> 00:27:32.590
<v Speaker 1>it's had,</v>

944
00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:34.740
<v Speaker 1>I ended up having a fire in it,</v>

945
00:27:34.770 --> 00:27:36.450
<v Speaker 1>but they had a new formula version,</v>

946
00:27:36.451 --> 00:27:38.520
<v Speaker 1>which the FDA hasn't tried yet.</v>

947
00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:40.560
<v Speaker 1>But the new form live version works really good,</v>

948
00:27:40.561 --> 00:27:42.100
<v Speaker 1>like way better than the old stuff that,</v>

949
00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:43.750
<v Speaker 1>but I think that has whatever's in,</v>

950
00:27:43.751 --> 00:27:44.730
<v Speaker 1>it's making me trip.</v>

951
00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:45.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

952
00:27:45.850 --> 00:27:47.490
<v Speaker 1>it's probably super bad for you.</v>

953
00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:49.920
<v Speaker 1>It's probably some crazy stimulants.</v>

954
00:27:49.921 --> 00:27:50.620
<v Speaker 1>And who,</v>

955
00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:51.241
<v Speaker 1>who knows,</v>

956
00:27:51.241 --> 00:27:51.830
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

957
00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:55.380
<v Speaker 1>you got to buy stuff from reputable sources like this.</v>

958
00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:59.850
<v Speaker 1>That's one thing that I disagree with people when they want to have total</v>

959
00:27:59.851 --> 00:28:02.910
<v Speaker 1>deregulation of drugs and and things like,</v>

960
00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:03.600
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

961
00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:08.340
<v Speaker 1>you gotta be careful of people that are just going to sell you some shit and</v>

962
00:28:08.341 --> 00:28:09.360
<v Speaker 1>tell you it's one thing.</v>

963
00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:10.620
<v Speaker 1>But it's actually something else.</v>

964
00:28:11.010 --> 00:28:16.010
<v Speaker 1>Like there should be some form of regulation when it comes to things like,</v>

965
00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:18.050
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

966
00:28:18.050 --> 00:28:18.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

967
00:28:18.390 --> 00:28:22.770
<v Speaker 1>anything that's got something in it that could be dangerous where it's like a</v>

968
00:28:22.771 --> 00:28:25.800
<v Speaker 1>stimulant or metals rip fuel type things.</v>

969
00:28:25.801 --> 00:28:27.360
<v Speaker 1>It turned out to kill a bunch of people.</v>

970
00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:28.493
<v Speaker 1>Like you should.</v>

971
00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:29.671
<v Speaker 1>We should,</v>

972
00:28:29.671 --> 00:28:33.750
<v Speaker 1>there should be some accountability and there also should be someone checking on</v>

973
00:28:33.751 --> 00:28:34.560
<v Speaker 1>that stuff.</v>

974
00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:39.560
<v Speaker 1>Like you kind of need someone checking to make sure that you're not gonna like</v>

975
00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:43.890
<v Speaker 1>inadvertently give someone who thinks they're just going to get some herbal,</v>

976
00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:44.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

977
00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:46.320
<v Speaker 1>testosterone booster,</v>

978
00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:48.570
<v Speaker 1>you're actually going to give him steroids and Viagara,</v>

979
00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:48.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

980
00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:49.980
<v Speaker 1>she'd be GNC.</v>

981
00:28:49.981 --> 00:28:50.581
<v Speaker 1>Why didn't you say,</v>

982
00:28:50.581 --> 00:28:50.791
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

983
00:28:50.791 --> 00:28:52.680
<v Speaker 1>I bought rip fuel when I was in high school.</v>

984
00:28:52.681 --> 00:28:54.480
<v Speaker 1>We used to all get on that shit.</v>

985
00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:57.150
<v Speaker 1>Nice school people died from that stuff.</v>

986
00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:57.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

987
00:28:57.660 --> 00:28:58.440
<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>

988
00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:00.840
<v Speaker 1>That's why a federal like you can't get that shit anymore.</v>

989
00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:03.240
<v Speaker 1>People used to just buy a federal used to be able to buy that.</v>

990
00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:04.930
<v Speaker 1>That's uh,</v>

991
00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:07.260
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking stimulant and the hardcore one too.</v>

992
00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:09.570
<v Speaker 1>And it just jacks your heart rate up man.</v>

993
00:29:09.571 --> 00:29:14.571
<v Speaker 1>Like my good buddy used to drink that red line stuff everyday in the gym five</v>

994
00:29:15.151 --> 00:29:17.760
<v Speaker 1>times a week and he's drinking red bull four times a day anyway.</v>

995
00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:20.550
<v Speaker 1>But he's lucky.</v>

996
00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:22.080
<v Speaker 1>He's lucky he's alive.</v>

997
00:29:22.910 --> 00:29:23.540
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

998
00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:23.771
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

999
00:29:23.771 --> 00:29:24.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1000
00:29:24.010 --> 00:29:27.540
<v Speaker 1>I took rip fuel once before Jujitsu and I literally thought I was going to have</v>

1001
00:29:27.541 --> 00:29:28.320
<v Speaker 1>a heart attack.</v>

1002
00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:30.600
<v Speaker 1>It didn't make any sense why my heart was beating so fast.</v>

1003
00:29:30.601 --> 00:29:31.050
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1004
00:29:31.050 --> 00:29:33.000
<v Speaker 1>I know I was working out and I know it was,</v>

1005
00:29:33.001 --> 00:29:33.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1006
00:29:33.390 --> 00:29:34.290
<v Speaker 1>exerting myself,</v>

1007
00:29:34.530 --> 00:29:34.921
<v Speaker 1>but I was like,</v>

1008
00:29:34.921 --> 00:29:36.960
<v Speaker 1>but this is just some next level shit.</v>

1009

00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:05.450
<v Speaker 3>which is a new cigarette,</v>

1142
00:33:05.451 --> 00:33:09.840
<v Speaker 3>got recalled from the FDA because they said that they were not tested like they</v>

1143
00:33:09.850 --> 00:33:14.150
<v Speaker 3>were using all this fucking imagine how bad your cigarettes have to be for the</v>

1144
00:33:14.151 --> 00:33:14.870
<v Speaker 3>FDA to go.</v>

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:31.520
<v Speaker 3>Came a whites and camel crush there.</v>

1153
00:33:31.521 --> 00:33:35.420
<v Speaker 3>They were not allowed to be sold because they never would have been tested and</v>

1154
00:33:35.421 --> 00:33:38.450
<v Speaker 3>they were using all different new filters and things that broken made meant</v>

1155
00:33:38.451 --> 00:33:39.620
<v Speaker 3>inside the cigarette.</v>

1156
00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:41.660
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's just people that don't like white people.</v>

1157
00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:42.553
<v Speaker 3>That's one thing.</v>

1158
00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:43.880
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to have camels,</v>

1159
00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:44.901
<v Speaker 3>those are white people,</v>

1160
00:33:44.901 --> 00:33:45.734
<v Speaker 3>cigarettes,</v>

1161
00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:47.713
<v Speaker 3>cigarettes,</v>

1162
00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:48.920
<v Speaker 3>Kools and black people.</v>

1163
00:33:48.921 --> 00:33:49.580
<v Speaker 3>Cigarettes.</v>

1164
00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:50.151
<v Speaker 3>Like if you,</v>

1165
00:33:50.151 --> 00:33:50.430
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1166

1168
00:33:56.900 --> 00:33:58.040
<v Speaker 3>or single moms.</v>

1169
00:33:58.220 --> 00:34:00.240
<v Speaker 3>They'll smoke Kools occasionally and they have to,</v>

1170
00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:01.153
<v Speaker 3>they're tanned.</v>

1171
00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:03.950
<v Speaker 3>Then go to tanning booths or black guys.</v>

1172
00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:09.200
<v Speaker 3>I'm a cigarette expert.</v>

1173
00:34:09.201 --> 00:34:11.180
<v Speaker 3>Yo Newport's who,</v>

1174

<v Speaker 3>who smokes?</v>

1175
00:34:11.691 --> 00:34:12.950
<v Speaker 3>Newports I don't know.</v>

1176
00:34:12.951 --> 00:34:14.720
<v Speaker 3>Black people and people who like black people,</v>

1177
00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:15.200
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1178
00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:16.730
<v Speaker 3>People hang out with black people.</v>

1179
00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:17.833
<v Speaker 3>They swung.</v>

1180
00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:21.010
<v Speaker 3>The worst is when you meet a white person that smokes menthols.</v>

1181
00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:21.261
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

1182
00:34:21.261 --> 00:34:24.020
<v Speaker 3>what happened to you man and filtered.</v>

1183
00:34:24.410 --> 00:34:26.630
<v Speaker 3>That's all white guys who were trappers.</v>

1184
00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:29.450
<v Speaker 3>They're all like fishermen and trappers and shit and they fucking,</v>

1185
00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:30.920
<v Speaker 3>they have hides,</v>

1186
00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:32.960
<v Speaker 3>tanning hides on the side of their house,</v>

1187
00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:33.471
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1188
00:34:33.471 --> 00:34:35.510
<v Speaker 3>like tacked down to hide and stretched down.</v>

1189
00:34:35.511 --> 00:34:36.440
<v Speaker 3>It was Alaska shows.</v>

1190
00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:39.020
<v Speaker 3>Those are the guys who smoke camels on filtered.</v>

1191
00:34:39.740 --> 00:34:43.250
<v Speaker 3>The only reason I smoke this is James Dean used to smoke lucky cigarettes and I</v>

1192
00:34:43.251 --> 00:34:43.431
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>

1193
00:34:43.431 --> 00:34:43.630
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

1194
00:34:43.630 --> 00:34:44.001
<v Speaker 3>I'd be like,</v>

1195
00:34:44.001 --> 00:34:46.910
<v Speaker 3>James Dean could move lucky unfiltered.</v>

1196
00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:49.430
<v Speaker 3>You know else James Deane smoked tolls.</v>

1197
00:34:50.930 --> 00:34:52.040
<v Speaker 3>He smoked polls too,</v>

1198
00:34:53.210 --> 00:34:55.190
<v Speaker 3>so he probably like just like things in his mouth.</v>

1199
00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:55.431
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1200
00:34:55.431 --> 00:34:56.241
<v Speaker 3>nothing wrong with that,</v>

1201
00:34:56.241 --> 00:34:57.890
<v Speaker 3>but maybe you shouldn't do what he does.</v>

1202
00:34:58.130 --> 00:34:59.660
<v Speaker 3>What do you think about playboy man?</v>

1203
00:34:59.870 --> 00:35:01.560
<v Speaker 3>Like taking all the nudity out.</v>

1204
00:35:01.570 --> 00:35:02.540
<v Speaker 3>He was very upset.</v>

1205
00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:04.550
<v Speaker 3>Bailey j are the funniest tweet about it.</v>

00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:14.653
<v Speaker 3>it's true.</v>

1216
00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:16.040
<v Speaker 3>It's totally true.</v>

1217
00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:17.480
<v Speaker 3>It's just fucking true.</v>

1218
00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:18.373
<v Speaker 3>Larry Flynt,</v>

1219
00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:21.110
<v Speaker 3>it was on like CNN the other day and he said it perfect.</v>

1220
00:35:21.111 --> 00:35:21.291
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1221
00:35:21.291 --> 00:35:21.650
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1222
00:35:21.650 --> 00:35:22.483
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1223
00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:24.680
<v Speaker 3>like you're taking your bread and butter away.</v>

1224
00:35:24.681 --> 00:35:26.740
<v Speaker 3>Why would the fuck he's at Hugh Hefner?</v>

1225
00:35:26.741 --> 00:35:28.370
<v Speaker 3>It's just a horrible businessman.</v>

1226
00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:29.091
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

1227
00:35:29.091 --> 00:35:29.201
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1228
00:35:29.201 --> 00:35:31.460
<v Speaker 3>he's the magazine's fine.</v>

1229
00:35:31.461 --> 00:35:31.671
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1230
00:35:31.671 --> 00:35:32.630
<v Speaker 3>don't touch it.</v>

1231
00:35:32.810 --> 00:35:34.070
<v Speaker 3>Well he's old.</v>

1232
00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:36.530
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he's necessarily running things anymore.</v>

1233
00:35:36.531 --> 00:35:37.650
<v Speaker 3>And I think this,</v>

1234
00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:38.190
<v Speaker 3>the fact</v>

1235
00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:42.450
<v Speaker 4>that we're talking about it means it was a good idea cause we're talking about</v>

1236
00:35:42.451 --> 00:35:42.690
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1237
00:35:42.690 --> 00:35:44.070
<v Speaker 4>No one talked about playboy,</v>

1238
00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:45.061
<v Speaker 4>like playboy.</v>

1239
00:35:45.061 --> 00:35:45.781
<v Speaker 4>Nobody gave a fuck.</v>

1240
00:35:45.781 --> 00:35:49.350
<v Speaker 4>They have to literally have to do something like this in order to get people to</v>

1241
00:35:49.351 --> 00:35:50.010
<v Speaker 4>talk about it.</v>

1242
00:35:50.010 --> 00:35:51.120
<v Speaker 4>It might be a good idea.</v>

1243
00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:51.991
<v Speaker 4>Honestly.</v>

1244
00:35:51.991 --> 00:35:52.371
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'm,</v>

1245
00:35:52.371 --> 00:35:55.170
<v Speaker 4>I'm the shittiest businessman of all time cause I don't,</v>

1246
00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:57.810
<v Speaker 4>I literally don't think about business ever at all.</v>

1247
00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:02.840
<v Speaker 4>I just do shit that I like to do and try to like work as hard as I can and try</v>

1248
00:36:03.181 --> 00:36:03.840
<v Speaker 4>to keep going,</v>

1249
00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:05.730
<v Speaker 4>find things that I'm interested in and keep going.</v>

1250
00:36:05.731 --> 00:36:06.564
<v Speaker 4>I never sit down and go,</v>

1251
00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:08.580
<v Speaker 4>what's the best business model?</v>

1252
00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:10.650
<v Speaker 4>What I need to do for my brand.</v>

1253
00:36:10.830 --> 00:36:12.180
<v Speaker 4>I need to expand.</v>

1254
00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:15.420
<v Speaker 4>What I need to do is I need to create some sort of a publicity stunt.</v>

1255
00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:17.760
<v Speaker 4>But if I was going to engineer a publicity stunt,</v>

1256
00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:19.230
<v Speaker 4>that's the best one.</v>

00:36:32.610 --> 00:36:34.350
<v Speaker 4>You're either going to go one way or the other.</v>

1262
00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:36.630
<v Speaker 4>Either you're going to go the route of the Internet and the Internet is going to</v>

1287
00:37:07.081 --> 00:37:11.880

1294
00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:22.470
<v Speaker 4>Like people would laugh about how nobody really read it for the articles.</v>

1295
00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:26.430
<v Speaker 4>But if you go and like you ever see like Frank Sinatra f interview,</v>

1296
00:37:26.431 --> 00:37:26.641
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1297
00:37:26.641 --> 00:37:26.941
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>

1298
00:37:26.941 --> 00:37:28.170
<v Speaker 4>those interviews and playboy,</v>

1299
00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:29.880
<v Speaker 4>these do,</v>

1300
00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:30.481
<v Speaker 4>if you're seeing those,</v>

1301
00:37:30.481 --> 00:37:35.430
<v Speaker 4>I actually have never read one single article in the interviews are classic.</v>

1302
00:37:36.010 --> 00:37:36.301
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1303
00:37:36.301 --> 00:37:36.571
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1304
00:37:36.571 --> 00:37:39.660
<v Speaker 4>I did an interview with playboy a long time ago and that's when I got into it</v>

1305
00:37:39.661 --> 00:37:40.494
<v Speaker 4>with Denis leary.</v>

1306
00:37:40.890 --> 00:37:41.160
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1307
00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:41.490

1308
00:37:41.490 --> 00:37:43.890
<v Speaker 4>that was from one of those playboy interviews.</v>

1309
00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:44.910
<v Speaker 4>This,</v>

1310
00:37:44.910 --> 00:37:47.460
<v Speaker 4>they've always had playboys,</v>

1311
00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:49.440
<v Speaker 4>always had like really good interviews.</v>

1312
00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:49.860
<v Speaker 4>They vote.</v>

1313
00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:50.693
<v Speaker 4>They had,</v>

1314
00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:51.301
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>

1315
00:37:51.301 --> 00:37:55.890
<v Speaker 4>I used to have this coffee table book of all the great interviews over the years</v>

1316
00:37:55.891 --> 00:37:56.724
<v Speaker 4>in playboy,</v>

1317
00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:57.713
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

1318
00:37:57.720 --> 00:37:59.460
<v Speaker 2>the whole feel of playboy,</v>

1319
00:37:59.461 --> 00:38:00.780
<v Speaker 2>Timmy was always style.</v>

1320
00:38:00.810 --> 00:38:02.070
<v Speaker 2>Like it was artistic.</v>

1321
00:38:02.071 --> 00:38:02.311
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1322
00:38:02.311 --> 00:38:03.840
<v Speaker 2>Hugh Hefner was an artist that,</v>

1323
00:38:03.870 --> 00:38:04.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1324
00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:07.110
<v Speaker 2>made women look beautiful and like you,</v>

1325
00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:09.660
<v Speaker 2>you wanted to see whatever.</v>

00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:10.553
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1327
00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:14.130
<v Speaker 2>who else is Sigourney weaver naked?</v>

1328
00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:16.970
<v Speaker 2>But you wanted to see waiver and then we got naked and shit.</v>

1329
00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:18.570
<v Speaker 2>You wanted to see her get naked.</v>

1330
00:38:18.571 --> 00:38:19.990
<v Speaker 2>Pamela Anderson Class.</v>

1331
00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.150
<v Speaker 2>He corny weaver window.</v>

1332
00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:21.331
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1333
00:38:21.331 --> 00:38:22.160
<v Speaker 2>I know what you're saying.</v>

1334
00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:23.010
<v Speaker 2>So famous.</v>

1335
00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:26.940
<v Speaker 2>You wanted to see a class like that's where Kardashians should have had her butt</v>

1336
00:38:26.941 --> 00:38:28.770
<v Speaker 2>shots instead of that other thing.</v>

1337
00:38:29.110 --> 00:38:30.150
<v Speaker 2>It was too late though.</v>

1338
00:38:30.330 --> 00:38:31.470
<v Speaker 2>By the time she came along.</v>

1339
00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:32.940
<v Speaker 2>It was a ghost town.</v>

1340
00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:33.750
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1341
00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:34.800
<v Speaker 2>But playboy,</v>

1342
00:38:34.801 --> 00:38:35.110
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1343
00:38:35.110 --> 00:38:38.020
<v Speaker 2>No one's talking about playboy because no one's talking about magazines at all.</v>

1344
00:38:38.021 --> 00:38:39.280
<v Speaker 2>Anything about magazines?</v>

1345
00:38:39.281 --> 00:38:42.480
<v Speaker 2>Playboy problem I think is like what Larry Flynn was saying,</v>

1346
00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:44.200
<v Speaker 2>that their business is all fucked up.</v>

1347
00:38:44.201 --> 00:38:44.681
<v Speaker 2>Playboys.</v>

1348
00:38:44.681 --> 00:38:47.470
<v Speaker 2>I believe it's subscription based to listen to playboy radio.</v>

1349
00:38:47.590 --> 00:38:49.150
<v Speaker 2>You have to pay $7 a month.</v>

1350
00:38:49.151 --> 00:38:49.391
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1351
00:38:49.391 --> 00:38:50.200
<v Speaker 2>it's like a stew.</v>

1352
00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:50.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1353
00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:53.110
<v Speaker 2>It's not like you can just turn on all playboy radio.</v>

1354
00:38:53.111 --> 00:38:53.400
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1355
00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:53.680
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1356
00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:54.250
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>

1357
00:38:54.250 --> 00:38:55.540
<v Speaker 2>is it on serious?</v>

1358
00:38:55.570 --> 00:38:56.500
<v Speaker 2>It used to be on serious,</v>

1359
00:38:56.501 --> 00:38:57.490
<v Speaker 2>but I think Sirius was like,</v>

1360
00:38:57.520 --> 00:38:58.060
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>

1361
00:38:58.060 --> 00:38:59.080
<v Speaker 2>we don't care about this anymore.</v>

1362
00:38:59.081 --> 00:38:59.531
<v Speaker 2>Bad on the,</v>

1363
00:38:59.531 --> 00:38:59.950
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

1364
00:38:59.950 --> 00:39:00.281
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1365
00:39:00.281 --> 00:39:01.900
<v Speaker 2>I used to be 10 bucks a month though,</v>

1366
00:39:01.901 --> 00:39:03.730
<v Speaker 2>or something like that on serious anymore.</v>

1367
00:39:03.731 --> 00:39:04.564
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it is</v>

1368
00:39:05.970 --> 00:39:06.803
<v Speaker 2>valuable.</v>

1369
00:39:08.990 --> 00:39:09.823
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

1370
00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:12.800
<v Speaker 4>the model is definitely dying.</v>

1371
00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:14.180
<v Speaker 4>The magazine model,</v>

1372
00:39:14.890 --> 00:39:15.723
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1373
00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:18.630
<v Speaker 2>well it was an internet radio station and originally launched on Xm Sirius</v>

1374
00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:21.570
<v Speaker 2>on a,</v>

1375
00:39:22.050 --> 00:39:22.291
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1376
00:39:22.291 --> 00:39:22.740
<v Speaker 2>here we go.</v>

1377
00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:25.380
<v Speaker 2>On March 9th,</v>

1378
00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:25.410
<v Speaker 2>2013,</v>

1379
00:39:25.410 --> 00:39:27.480
<v Speaker 2>Kevin Kline and Andrea,</v>

1380
00:39:27.481 --> 00:39:30.660
<v Speaker 2>they announced that playboy morning showed that the playboy will no longer be</v>

1381
00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:32.430
<v Speaker 2>featured on sm Eric,</v>

1382
00:39:32.431 --> 00:39:33.264
<v Speaker 2>Sirius Xm.</v>

1383
00:39:33.490 --> 00:39:33.950
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

1384
00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:34.230
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1385
00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:37.800
<v Speaker 2>you can only go to playboy radio and they want you to pay for it.</v>

1386
00:39:37.801 --> 00:39:39.090
<v Speaker 2>Playboy radio.com.</v>

1387
00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:39.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1388
00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:40.990
<v Speaker 4>See that's a big mistake.</v>

1389
00:39:40.991 --> 00:39:41.470
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1390
00:39:41.470 --> 00:39:43.720
<v Speaker 4>That's a big mistake to get people to pay for it because,</v>

1391
00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:43.891
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1392
00:39:43.891 --> 00:39:44.591
<v Speaker 4>why would they do that?</v>

1393
00:39:44.591 --> 00:39:46.960
<v Speaker 4>When you can get the Ted Radio Hour,</v>

00:39:46.961 --> 00:39:48.790
<v Speaker 4>you can get getting Doug with high,</v>

00:39:50.441 --> 00:39:52.630
<v Speaker 4>You can get the Church of what's happening now.</v>

1398
00:39:52.631 --> 00:39:53.200
<v Speaker 4>You can get,</v>

1399
00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:54.130
<v Speaker 4>you can get fucking,</v>

1400
00:39:54.610 --> 00:39:59.290
<v Speaker 4>there's so many podcasts that are amazing and they're free for playboy to come</v>

1401
00:39:59.291 --> 00:39:59.861
<v Speaker 4>along and say,</v>

1402
00:39:59.861 --> 00:40:00.011
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

1403
00:40:00.011 --> 00:40:03.340
<v Speaker 4>we want $10 a month or $7 a month or whatever it is.</v>

1404
00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:05.170
<v Speaker 4>It's $7 a month.</v>

1405
00:40:05.171 --> 00:40:06.940
<v Speaker 4>Too much or $10 a month too much.</v>

1406
00:40:06.941 --> 00:40:07.301
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>

1407
00:40:07.301 --> 00:40:08.080
<v Speaker 4>you can't do it.</v>

1408
00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:08.860
<v Speaker 4>You can't,</v>

1409
00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:09.820
<v Speaker 4>it's a shitty model.</v>

1410
00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:10.511
<v Speaker 4>That's you're,</v>

1411
00:40:10.511 --> 00:40:10.781
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

1412
00:40:10.781 --> 00:40:11.614
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

1413
00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:16.710
<v Speaker 4>you're operating on this idea that likes subscription based stuff still exists.</v>

1414
00:40:18.850 --> 00:40:19.840
<v Speaker 4>And it really doesn't,</v>

1415
00:40:19.841 --> 00:40:21.340
<v Speaker 4>unless it's something like Netflix,</v>

1416
00:40:21.550 --> 00:40:26.550
<v Speaker 4>just think about how arrogant you would have to be to want $7 a month for your</v>

1417
00:40:26.591 --> 00:40:28.150
<v Speaker 4>fucking podcast,</v>

1418
00:40:28.151 --> 00:40:29.380
<v Speaker 4>your radio show,</v>

1419
00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:33.160
<v Speaker 4>when you can get Netflix for nine bucks a month.</v>

1420
00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:34.001
<v Speaker 4>Did they raised it right?</v>

1421
00:40:34.001 --> 00:40:35.950
<v Speaker 4>They made it nine now I think Netflix did.</v>

1422
00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:37.890
<v Speaker 4>It's still a great deal.</v>

1423
00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:38.920
<v Speaker 4>Amazing deal.</v>

1424
00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:40.180
<v Speaker 4>Just stop and think about that.</v>

1425
00:40:40.330 --> 00:40:43.120
<v Speaker 4>Think about how many fucking standup comedy specials I believe.</v>

1426
00:40:43.330 --> 00:40:43.481
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1427
00:40:43.481 --> 00:40:44.270
<v Speaker 4>I can't even say that.</v>

1428
00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:45.103
<v Speaker 4>I'm not supposed to,</v>

1429
00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:45.990
<v Speaker 4>but um,</v>

1430
00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:46.260
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

1431
00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:46.541
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

1432
00:40:46.541 --> 00:40:48.970
<v Speaker 4>just think bill burrs specials.</v>

1433
00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:51.850
<v Speaker 4>Thompson Sigora just shot his second special,</v>

1434
00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:52.660
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1435
00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:53.290
<v Speaker 4>fuck I,</v>

1436
00:40:53.290 --> 00:40:55.690
<v Speaker 4>I did one on Netflix in 2005.</v>

1437
00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:56.620
<v Speaker 4>So it's like,</v>

1438
00:40:56.620 --> 00:40:57.580
<v Speaker 4>you think about all,</v>

1439
00:40:57.581 --> 00:40:58.271
<v Speaker 4>it's 10 bucks an hour,</v>

1440
00:40:58.271 --> 00:40:59.104
<v Speaker 4>is that what you're showing me?</v>

1441
00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:00.393
<v Speaker 4>Playboy radio</v>

1442
00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:03.610
<v Speaker 2>radio is $4 and 17 cents a month.</v>

1443
00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:06.020
<v Speaker 4>If you do it 12 months a description.</v>

1444
00:41:06.170 --> 00:41:07.430
<v Speaker 4>If you do it for one month,</v>

1445
00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:08.293
<v Speaker 4>it's what?</v>

1446
00:41:08.730 --> 00:41:10.520
<v Speaker 4>17% about $5 a month.</v>

1447
00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:11.120
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

1448
00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:12.080
<v Speaker 4>so five bucks a month.</v>

1449
00:41:12.110 --> 00:41:14.900
<v Speaker 4>It's still more reasonable with still ridiculous.</v>

1450
00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:16.880
<v Speaker 4>No one's paying that bad business model.</v>

1451
00:41:16.881 --> 00:41:18.080
<v Speaker 4>It's terrible business model.</v>

1452
00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:18.860
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1453
00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:19.071
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1454
00:41:19.071 --> 00:41:20.720
<v Speaker 4>they're talking about doing that with Howard Stern.</v>

1455
00:41:21.050 --> 00:41:25.190
<v Speaker 4>They were talking about doing that with something like Spotify and make it the</v>

1456
00:41:25.191 --> 00:41:27.170
<v Speaker 4>way they were talking was so gross.</v>

1457
00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:28.190
<v Speaker 4>And then I said they,</v>

1458
00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:32.600
<v Speaker 4>I mean these business analysts who were quoting people who supposedly work for</v>

1459
00:41:32.601 --> 00:41:33.230
<v Speaker 4>this show,</v>

1460
00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:34.640
<v Speaker 4>it could be all bullshit.</v>

1461
00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:36.080
<v Speaker 4>It could be all rumors,</v>

1462
00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:38.960
<v Speaker 4>but the way they were saying it was like they were banking on it.</v>

1463
00:41:38.961 --> 00:41:39.201
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1464
00:41:39.201 --> 00:41:41.360
<v Speaker 4>because at the end of the day,</v>

1465
00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:44.030
<v Speaker 4>if there's anybody that can get people to pay for war,</v>

1466
00:41:44.090 --> 00:41:44.660
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1467
00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:45.860
<v Speaker 4>some sort of a podcast,</v>

1468
00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:46.520
<v Speaker 4>it's him.</v>

1469
00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:46.671
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1470
00:41:46.671 --> 00:41:49.550
<v Speaker 4>he's got Howard Stern's got the most loyal listeners.</v>

1471
00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:51.260
<v Speaker 4>It's been around the longest time.</v>

1472
00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:52.490
<v Speaker 4>There's people that for him,</v>

1473
00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:53.300
<v Speaker 4>for them,</v>

1474
00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:56.690
<v Speaker 4>he's a part of their daily commute and has been for decades.</v>

1475
00:41:56.691 --> 00:41:57.440
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1476
00:41:57.440 --> 00:42:02.440
<v Speaker 4>But they were talking about like doing it where it's like $7 a month for his</v>

1477
00:42:02.841 --> 00:42:03.560
<v Speaker 4>show.</v>

1478
00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:04.191
<v Speaker 4>And they were like,</v>

1479
00:42:04.191 --> 00:42:06.950
<v Speaker 4>we could get 10 million listeners,</v>

1480
00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:08.990
<v Speaker 4>so he'd be getting $70 million a month.</v>

1481
00:42:08.991 --> 00:42:09.380
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1482
00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:09.651
<v Speaker 4>bitch,</v>

1483
00:42:09.651 --> 00:42:11.150
<v Speaker 4>are you out of your fucking mind?</v>

1484
00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:13.700
<v Speaker 4>You really think you're going to get 10 million people?</v>

1485
00:42:13.790 --> 00:42:17.540
<v Speaker 4>They're going to pay $7 a month for a podcast.</v>

1486
00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:18.650
<v Speaker 4>10 million.</v>

1487
00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:20.120
<v Speaker 4>Good luck.</v>

1488
00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:21.081
<v Speaker 4>Good fuck.</v>

1489
00:42:21.081 --> 00:42:22.190
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy talk.</v>

1490
00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:24.470
<v Speaker 4>But listen to someone say something like that.</v>

1491

1497
00:42:28.910 --> 00:42:29.743

<v Speaker 4>Isn't it crazy?</v>

1501
00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:41.210
<v Speaker 4>Howard's been on the air for decades and he's got all this stuff banked up.</v>

1502
00:42:41.211 --> 00:42:45.100
<v Speaker 4>You can listen to Howard 100 and year classic interviews from back and it's</v>

1503
00:42:45.110 --> 00:42:45.591
<v Speaker 4>amazing.</v>

1504
00:42:45.591 --> 00:42:47.030
<v Speaker 4>Let's keep this better and better.</v>

1505
00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:47.480
<v Speaker 4>Nope,</v>

1506
00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:48.320
<v Speaker 4>that's not how they think.</v>

1507
00:42:48.590 --> 00:42:49.250
<v Speaker 4>They think,</v>

1508
00:42:49.250 --> 00:42:50.870
<v Speaker 4>how do we make money off of them?</v>

1509
00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:56.260
<v Speaker 4>How do we take this guy and how do we turn this into 10 million subscribers</v>

1510
00:42:56.811 --> 00:43:00.680
<v Speaker 4>paying $70 a month and then they're all thinking if I just get a piece of that,</v>

1511
00:43:01.010 --> 00:43:01.940
<v Speaker 4>if I get a piece of that,</v>

1512
00:43:01.941 --> 00:43:05.180
<v Speaker 4>that they're looking at their house in the Hamptons and then they thinking about</v>

1513
00:43:05.181 --> 00:43:05.781
<v Speaker 4>their Porsche,</v>

1514
00:43:05.781 --> 00:43:06.820
<v Speaker 4>there'll be drive in.</v>

1515
00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:08.300
<v Speaker 4>Ah Right.</v>

1516
00:43:08.301 --> 00:43:12.320
<v Speaker 4>And then you've got all these people around you that are like grabbing and</v>

1517
00:43:12.321 --> 00:43:13.730
<v Speaker 4>pulling and tugging.</v>

1518
00:43:13.790 --> 00:43:14.660
<v Speaker 4>That's what it's like.</v>

1519
00:43:14.661 --> 00:43:19.661
<v Speaker 4>If you work for some big giant ass corporation that feeds off of having a bunch</v>

1520
00:43:20.031 --> 00:43:21.440
<v Speaker 4>of different shows on its network.</v>

1521
00:43:21.830 --> 00:43:24.110
<v Speaker 4>Like if you work for some corporation,</v>

1522
00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:24.530
<v Speaker 4>like a,</v>

1523
00:43:24.530 --> 00:43:27.530
<v Speaker 4>like a Sirius XM or playboy or anything like that,</v>

1524
00:43:27.531 --> 00:43:29.500
<v Speaker 4>like they need to keep that fucking thing alive.</v>

1525
00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:31.190
<v Speaker 4>Like we need money coming in.</v>

1526
00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:33.200
<v Speaker 4>We cannot just operate on the ideas.</v>

1527
00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:34.610
<v Speaker 4>We need money coming in.</v>

1528
00:43:35.210 --> 00:43:35.391
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1529
00:43:35.391 --> 00:43:38.750
<v Speaker 4>I think we can get playboy radio and a half people will pay about $7 a month.</v>

1530
00:43:38.751 --> 00:43:39.584
<v Speaker 4>Let's do it.</v>

1531
00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:40.341
<v Speaker 4>Seven Mag.</v>

1532
00:43:40.341 --> 00:43:40.790
<v Speaker 4>That money,</v>

1533
00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:41.210
<v Speaker 4>how much?</v>

1534
00:43:41.210 --> 00:43:42.290
<v Speaker 4>How many people do you think we're going to make?</v>

1535
00:43:42.530 --> 00:43:43.610
<v Speaker 4>I think about a million a month.</v>

1536
00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:44.900
<v Speaker 4>1 million a month.</v>

1537
00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:45.980
<v Speaker 4>5 million a month.</v>

1538
00:43:45.981 --> 00:43:46.631
<v Speaker 4>We're out of the whole,</v>

1539
00:43:46.631 --> 00:43:47.720
<v Speaker 4>how the whole in six months.</v>

1540
00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:50.210
<v Speaker 4>And people start thinking like that and then,</v>

1541
00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:51.313
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1542
00:43:51.830 --> 00:43:52.790
<v Speaker 4>but what the fuck do I know?</v>

1543
00:43:53.490 --> 00:43:54.000
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>

1544
00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:54.960

1545
00:43:54.961 --> 00:43:55.171
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1546

1552
00:44:01.081 --> 00:44:01.441
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

00:44:41.420 --> 00:44:43.610
<v Speaker 1>I just don't think that they can make it.</v>

1589
00:44:44.330 --> 00:44:46.760
<v Speaker 1>It's like you can scrape out as much money as you have.</v>

1590
00:44:46.761 --> 00:44:47.900
<v Speaker 1>Keep a skeleton crew,</v>

1591
00:44:48.260 --> 00:44:48.920
<v Speaker 1>run,</v>

1592
00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:51.660
<v Speaker 1>run those magazines as long as you can while there,</v>

1593
00:44:51.690 --> 00:44:52.730
<v Speaker 1>as long as they're profitable.</v>

1594
00:44:52.731 --> 00:44:54.410
<v Speaker 1>But be ready to pull that shoot,</v>

1595
00:44:55.010 --> 00:44:56.120
<v Speaker 1>be ready to pull that shoot.</v>

1596
00:44:56.530 --> 00:44:59.540
<v Speaker 1>Cause now like you can just get shit on your iPad,</v>

1597
00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:00.433
<v Speaker 1>that's new.</v>

1598
00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:03.320
<v Speaker 1>And then they have these things that are like essentially like Spotify for your</v>

1599
00:45:03.321 --> 00:45:04.040
<v Speaker 1>iPad.</v>

1600
00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:07.700
<v Speaker 1>Say you can choose from a bunch of different magazines like time and Newsweek</v>

1601
00:45:07.701 --> 00:45:11.450
<v Speaker 1>and all these different magazines or you can get them on your iPad,</v>

1602
00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:12.201
<v Speaker 1>go through it,</v>

1603
00:45:12.201 --> 00:45:12.981
<v Speaker 1>you download it,</v>

1604
00:45:12.981 --> 00:45:15.290
<v Speaker 1>you get each page as a full image,</v>

1605
00:45:15.291 --> 00:45:18.380
<v Speaker 1>you can stretch it out and move in and it's so much better.</v>

1606
00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:19.820
<v Speaker 1>It's so much better.</v>

1607
00:45:19.970 --> 00:45:23.150
<v Speaker 1>And once they start doing it like that where you have like these subscriptions,</v>

1608
00:45:23.900 --> 00:45:24.733
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's just not going to be around anymore.</v>

1611
00:45:28.610 --> 00:45:29.900
<v Speaker 1>Why would you want that print thing?</v>

1612
00:45:29.901 --> 00:45:32.900
<v Speaker 1>It's killing paper or its killing trees rather than make that paper.</v>

1613
00:45:33.050 --> 00:45:34.040
<v Speaker 1>You could just get the,</v>

<v Speaker 1>the thing downloaded to your phone instantly like that.</v>

<v Speaker 2>How are we talking?</v>

1697
00:47:01.181 --> 00:47:02.014
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1698
00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:03.550
<v Speaker 2>It was a cool thing to do,</v>

1699
00:47:03.551 --> 00:47:04.470
<v Speaker 2>but to go online,</v>

1700
00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:06.420
<v Speaker 1>start a chat with some guy from Japan,</v>

1701
00:47:06.421 --> 00:47:07.920
<v Speaker 1>he's just going to show you his dick.</v>

1702
00:47:08.370 --> 00:47:09.300
<v Speaker 1>It's just a matter of time,</v>

1703
00:47:10.340 --> 00:47:10.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1704
00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:11.551
<v Speaker 1>there's no like,</v>

1705
00:47:11.551 --> 00:47:12.930
<v Speaker 1>friendship thing like that,</v>

1706
00:47:12.931 --> 00:47:13.920
<v Speaker 1>like ham radio.</v>

1707
00:47:14.350 --> 00:47:15.330
<v Speaker 1>Like back then,</v>

1708
00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:18.030
<v Speaker 1>if you were on the radio with some guy,</v>

1709
00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:18.661
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1710
00:47:18.661 --> 00:47:19.260
<v Speaker 1>and you're like,</v>

1711
00:47:19.260 --> 00:47:19.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1712
00:47:19.650 --> 00:47:20.850
<v Speaker 1>so you,</v>

1713
00:47:20.851 --> 00:47:22.770
<v Speaker 1>what time is it in Germany?</v>

1714
00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:24.630
<v Speaker 1>Time for me to fuck your mother,</v>

1715
00:47:24.780 --> 00:47:24.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1716
00:47:24.990 --> 00:47:25.823
<v Speaker 1>like that did,</v>

1717
00:47:25.950 --> 00:47:27.150
<v Speaker 1>they didn't talk like that.</v>

1718
00:47:27.151 --> 00:47:28.680
<v Speaker 1>They didn't talk like Internet people.</v>

1719
00:47:28.930 --> 00:47:31.120
<v Speaker 1>They had to actually like speak to each other.</v>

1720
00:47:31.570 --> 00:47:34.140
<v Speaker 1>So because that element of you say something,</v>

1721
00:47:34.150 --> 00:47:35.050
<v Speaker 1>someone reacts,</v>

1722
00:47:35.290 --> 00:47:36.880
<v Speaker 1>there was probably way less trolling.</v>

1723
00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:37.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there was like,</v>

1724
00:47:37.870 --> 00:47:39.220
<v Speaker 1>and you could get in trouble too.</v>

1725
00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:43.930
<v Speaker 1>Like you get your ham radio license taken away from you if you do shitty things.</v>

1726
00:47:44.410 --> 00:47:45.240
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1727
00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:46.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't even think you're allowed to swear.</v>

1728
00:47:47.620 --> 00:47:48.850
<v Speaker 1>I think on a ham radio,</v>

1729
00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:50.860
<v Speaker 1>I think there's like restrictions on language</v>

1730
00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:52.250
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] right.</v>

1731
00:47:52.550 --> 00:47:53.510
<v Speaker 2>It is regulated.</v>

1732
00:47:53.511 --> 00:47:53.870
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1733
00:47:53.870 --> 00:47:54.600
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1734
00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:55.040
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1735
00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:55.873
<v Speaker 2>let's see.</v>

1736
00:47:55.910 --> 00:47:59.090
<v Speaker 2>I know they're going to make you a register your drones now,</v>

1737
00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:00.980
<v Speaker 2>so it's gonna be like a car.</v>

1738
00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:02.480
<v Speaker 2>You're gonna have to get like a fishing license.</v>

1739
00:48:02.481 --> 00:48:04.610
<v Speaker 2>Probably every time you get a drone.</v>

1740
00:48:05.870 --> 00:48:06.703
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense.</v>

1741
00:48:06.770 --> 00:48:08.060
<v Speaker 1>That was only a matter of time.</v>

1742
00:48:08.390 --> 00:48:09.230
<v Speaker 1>I was um,</v>

1743
00:48:09.860 --> 00:48:10.191
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1744
00:48:10.191 --> 00:48:11.024
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1745
00:48:11.810 --> 00:48:13.160
<v Speaker 1>Alberta last year or this,</v>

1746
00:48:13.161 --> 00:48:13.281
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1747
00:48:13.281 --> 00:48:13.581
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1748
00:48:13.581 --> 00:48:13.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1749
00:48:13.730 --> 00:48:14.563
<v Speaker 1>spring rather.</v>

1750
00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:19.340
<v Speaker 1>And this guy had one that was attached to a cell phone and he's flying it around</v>

1751
00:48:19.350 --> 00:48:22.820
<v Speaker 1>land and we're watching the image on the cell phone,</v>

1752
00:48:22.940 --> 00:48:23.181
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1753
00:48:23.181 --> 00:48:24.110
<v Speaker 1>cause it's transmitting.</v>

1754
00:48:24.111 --> 00:48:24.471
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

1755
00:48:24.471 --> 00:48:25.880
<v Speaker 1>this is fucking crazy.</v>

1756
00:48:25.940 --> 00:48:27.350
<v Speaker 1>This is way too good.</v>

1757
00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:28.850
<v Speaker 1>It's way too good.</v>

1758
00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:30.800
<v Speaker 1>Way Too good and way too easy.</v>

1759
00:48:30.830 --> 00:48:32.180
<v Speaker 1>Cause he's just maneuvering it,</v>

1760
00:48:32.770 --> 00:48:33.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1761
00:48:33.270 --> 00:48:33.891
<v Speaker 1>moving it right.</v>

1762
00:48:33.891 --> 00:48:35.090
<v Speaker 1>You can do it with your phone.</v>

1763
00:48:35.091 --> 00:48:36.200
<v Speaker 1>You can do it with a remote.</v>

1764
00:48:36.260 --> 00:48:37.700
<v Speaker 1>They're the ones that they have now.</v>

1765
00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:38.870
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of them too.</v>

1766
00:48:38.871 --> 00:48:39.890
<v Speaker 1>A lot of different models.</v>

1767
00:48:40.070 --> 00:48:41.600
<v Speaker 1>They're fucking really good man.</v>

1768
00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:42.481
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1769
00:48:42.481 --> 00:48:44.190
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking about getting one a while ago,</v>

1770
00:48:44.191 --> 00:48:45.930
<v Speaker 2>but I think I'll wait it out.</v>

1771
00:48:46.230 --> 00:48:49.470
<v Speaker 2>It looks like it would be fun just to do like cool video stuff.</v>

1772
00:48:50.620 --> 00:48:51.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1773
00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:52.000
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1774
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:52.780
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>

1775
00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:53.710
<v Speaker 1>it is cool.</v>

1776
00:48:53.740 --> 00:48:53.951
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1777
00:48:53.951 --> 00:48:54.611
<v Speaker 1>they're still cool.</v>

1778
00:48:54.611 --> 00:48:55.990
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if you get grandfathered in.</v>

1779
00:48:56.270 --> 00:48:58.220
<v Speaker 2>It's like if you have like an AK 47 or something,</v>

1780
00:48:58.240 --> 00:48:59.150
<v Speaker 2>the grant come and tag it.</v>

1781
00:48:59.250 --> 00:48:59.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1782
00:48:59.580 --> 00:49:00.413
<v Speaker 2>I am now.</v>

1783
00:49:00.550 --> 00:49:00.800
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1784
00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:02.070
<v Speaker 2>you posted the wrong link off.</v>

1785
00:49:02.071 --> 00:49:03.340
<v Speaker 2>So on your Twitter for what?</v>

1786
00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:06.200
<v Speaker 2>So you guys are on youtube now streaming instead of a youth.</v>

1787
00:49:06.290 --> 00:49:06.411
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1788
00:49:06.411 --> 00:49:07.720
<v Speaker 2>did I post to the use?</v>

1789
00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:08.640
<v Speaker 2>Oops.</v>

1790
00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:09.740
<v Speaker 2>At Jesus Christ.</v>

1791
00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:10.451
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1792
00:49:10.451 --> 00:49:11.900
<v Speaker 2>it looks great on youtube though.</v>

1793
00:49:11.901 --> 00:49:13.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking at the picture quality,</v>

1794
00:49:13.221 --> 00:49:13.371
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1795
00:49:13.371 --> 00:49:14.270
<v Speaker 2>How do I find it right now,</v>

1796
00:49:14.271 --> 00:49:14.571
<v Speaker 2>Jamie,</v>

1797
00:49:14.571 --> 00:49:17.990
<v Speaker 2>if I want to find it so we're not on Ustream.</v>

1798
00:49:18.170 --> 00:49:18.890
<v Speaker 2>I just tweeted,</v>

1799
00:49:18.890 --> 00:49:22.610
<v Speaker 2>I just tweeted the right still haven't figured out how to do the Ustream at the</v>

1800
00:49:22.611 --> 00:49:23.180
<v Speaker 2>same time.</v>

1801
00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:23.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1802
00:49:23.730 --> 00:49:24.080
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

1803
00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:24.740
<v Speaker 2>hold on.</v>

1804
00:49:24.740 --> 00:49:29.270
<v Speaker 2>You should be able to just split it that video so it's not,</v>

1805
00:49:29.380 --> 00:49:30.290
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't work that way.</v>

1806
00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:32.420
<v Speaker 2>The Ham radio stuff,</v>

1807
00:49:32.421 --> 00:49:33.500
<v Speaker 2>it's an amateur radio.</v>

1808
00:49:33.501 --> 00:49:34.460
<v Speaker 2>There's regulations,</v>

1809
00:49:34.461 --> 00:49:36.130
<v Speaker 2>but it depends on how big prior,</v>

1810
00:49:36.131 --> 00:49:37.820
<v Speaker 2>how strong your ham radio signal is.</v>

1811
00:49:37.980 --> 00:49:40.010
<v Speaker 2>Stuff you can broadcast really strongly.</v>

1812
00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:43.310
<v Speaker 2>Then you become like you're a little radio station and then you have</v>

1813
00:49:43.311 --> 00:49:44.144
<v Speaker 2>regulations,</v>

1814
00:49:44.170 --> 00:49:45.003
<v Speaker 2>but well,</v>

1815
00:49:45.290 --> 00:49:50.290
<v Speaker 2>how has that technology work to where people in other countries are listening to</v>

1816
00:49:51.651 --> 00:49:51.951
<v Speaker 2>it though?</v>

1817
00:49:51.951 --> 00:49:53.780
<v Speaker 2>It's like what kind of radio station is this?</v>

1818
00:49:53.781 --> 00:49:54.850
<v Speaker 2>It's better than FM.</v>

1819
00:49:55.090 --> 00:49:55.440
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1820
00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:56.160
<v Speaker 2>because it's a little,</v>

1821
00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:57.710
<v Speaker 2>it's like a low frequency signal.</v>

1822
00:49:58.810 --> 00:50:01.100
<v Speaker 2>Like you can get am radio from all over the place,</v>

1823
00:50:01.101 --> 00:50:01.610
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1824
00:50:01.610 --> 00:50:02.480
<v Speaker 2>Just in your house.</v>

1825
00:50:02.970 --> 00:50:03.570
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1826
00:50:03.570 --> 00:50:06.930
<v Speaker 1>You can get radio from radio,</v>

1827
00:50:06.931 --> 00:50:08.490
<v Speaker 1>radio goes further,</v>

1828
00:50:08.790 --> 00:50:13.250
<v Speaker 1>radio am radio rather it goes further than FM but just doesn't have as high a a</v>

1829
00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:13.830
<v Speaker 1>bandwidth.</v>

1830
00:50:13.830 --> 00:50:14.011
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1831
00:50:14.011 --> 00:50:16.080
<v Speaker 1>I find it amazing when people are still listening to radio.</v>

1832
00:50:16.081 --> 00:50:16.914
<v Speaker 1>That's another one.</v>

1833
00:50:17.070 --> 00:50:18.390
<v Speaker 1>I thought that would have been gone too.</v>

1834
00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:20.220
<v Speaker 1>I still listen to them unfortunately,</v>

1835
00:50:20.250 --> 00:50:22.560
<v Speaker 1>but I have friends at work in it and uh,</v>

1836
00:50:22.650 --> 00:50:23.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1837
00:50:23.010 --> 00:50:23.281
<v Speaker 1>they'll,</v>

1838
00:50:23.281 --> 00:50:24.090
<v Speaker 1>it's brutal.</v>

1839
00:50:24.090 --> 00:50:25.140
<v Speaker 1>You watch the way they work.</v>

1840
00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:27.000
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing because what they're,</v>

1841
00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:28.130
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1842
00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:29.720
<v Speaker 1>besides the plane record part,</v>

1843
00:50:29.990 --> 00:50:33.740
<v Speaker 1>what they're doing as a podcast and the plane record part would be fucking</v>

1844
00:50:33.770 --> 00:50:35.210
<v Speaker 1>infinitely easier,</v>

1845
00:50:35.390 --> 00:50:37.490
<v Speaker 1>infinitely easier if you could do it on a podcast,</v>

1846
00:50:37.970 --> 00:50:40.290
<v Speaker 1>if you could just play records on a podcast.</v>

1847
00:50:40.291 --> 00:50:43.280
<v Speaker 1>So you don't need a bunch of people working behind the scenes.</v>

1848
00:50:43.281 --> 00:50:43.520
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1849
00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:43.911
<v Speaker 1>you just,</v>

1850
00:50:43.911 --> 00:50:44.744
<v Speaker 1>you just play it.</v>

1851
00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:47.960
<v Speaker 1>And if we could just play anything you wanted but you can't really,</v>

1852
00:50:48.410 --> 00:50:49.280
<v Speaker 1>you can play it.</v>

1853
00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:50.660
<v Speaker 1>But there's like fair use.</v>

1854
00:50:50.661 --> 00:50:53.750
<v Speaker 1>You could use something in certain podcasts,</v>

1855
00:50:53.751 --> 00:50:54.450
<v Speaker 1>he could use it,</v>

1856
00:50:54.450 --> 00:50:55.010
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

1857
00:50:55.010 --> 00:50:58.010
<v Speaker 1>it's not a hundred percent clearly defined right now.</v>

1858
00:50:58.460 --> 00:50:59.690
<v Speaker 1>But for radio man,</v>

1859
00:51:00.050 --> 00:51:00.410
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

1860
00:51:00.410 --> 00:51:01.460
<v Speaker 1>I talked to a,</v>

1861
00:51:01.461 --> 00:51:02.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say their names,</v>

1862
00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:04.190
<v Speaker 1>but they're good guys and they're,</v>

1863
00:51:04.191 --> 00:51:05.120
<v Speaker 1>they're fun guys.</v>

1864
00:51:05.121 --> 00:51:06.320
<v Speaker 1>And I like doing the show.</v>

1865
00:51:06.470 --> 00:51:07.303
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

1866
00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:08.720
<v Speaker 1>one of them was,</v>

1867
00:51:08.721 --> 00:51:08.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1868
00:51:08.930 --> 00:51:11.030
<v Speaker 1>telling me that they just got done with their,</v>

1869
00:51:11.031 --> 00:51:11.864
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1870
00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:12.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1871
00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:14.240
<v Speaker 1>they have a review where the company comes in,</v>

1872
00:51:14.241 --> 00:51:14.751
<v Speaker 1>sits him down,</v>

1873
00:51:14.751 --> 00:51:15.500
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

1874
00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:15.861
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

1875
00:51:15.861 --> 00:51:17.450
<v Speaker 1>they fucking hate everything we did.</v>

1876
00:51:17.451 --> 00:51:17.721
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

1877
00:51:17.721 --> 00:51:17.910
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1878
00:51:17.910 --> 00:51:20.030
<v Speaker 1>we've been successful for decades.</v>

1879
00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:21.140
<v Speaker 1>They've been around forever.</v>

1880
00:51:21.290 --> 00:51:21.950
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

1881
00:51:21.950 --> 00:51:23.660
<v Speaker 1>I've never had one of these meetings where they say,</v>

1882
00:51:23.661 --> 00:51:24.350
<v Speaker 1>we're doing great.</v>

1883
00:51:24.350 --> 00:51:25.070
<v Speaker 1>Never.</v>

1884
00:51:25.070 --> 00:51:26.000
<v Speaker 1>Everything is bad.</v>

1885
00:51:26.001 --> 00:51:27.260
<v Speaker 1>Everything is not good.</v>

1886
00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:28.940
<v Speaker 1>They're always looking to cut staff.</v>

1887
00:51:28.941 --> 00:51:30.320
<v Speaker 1>They're always looking to fire people.</v>

1888
00:51:30.530 --> 00:51:35.530
<v Speaker 1>It's just like this total negative meeting with these misers and these money</v>

1889
00:51:36.021 --> 00:51:38.090
<v Speaker 1>people and these numbers crunchers.</v>

1890
00:51:38.090 --> 00:51:38.720
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>

1891
00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:40.670
<v Speaker 1>we have to maximize profits.</v>

1892
00:51:40.860 --> 00:51:41.421
<v Speaker 1>We have to fit.</v>

1893
00:51:41.421 --> 00:51:44.960
<v Speaker 1>We have a strategy to maximize profits when need more commercial.</v>

1894
00:51:44.961 --> 00:51:46.190
<v Speaker 1>Two I had more commercials.</v>

1895
00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:46.971
<v Speaker 1>So like you'll,</v>

1896
00:51:46.971 --> 00:51:47.300
<v Speaker 1>you'll,</v>

1897
00:51:47.300 --> 00:51:52.220
<v Speaker 1>you'll do a break and then they'll play like seven minutes of commercials and</v>

1898
00:51:52.221 --> 00:51:54.550
<v Speaker 1>then they'll play a song and then you go back to talking again.</v>

1899
00:51:54.570 --> 00:51:54.831
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

1900
00:51:54.831 --> 00:51:57.800
<v Speaker 1>what is this fucking commercial thing you guys are doing?</v>

1901
00:51:58.130 --> 00:52:00.260
<v Speaker 1>Because how many of those can you do in an hour?</v>

1902
00:52:00.261 --> 00:52:01.880
<v Speaker 1>If you've got seven and then you've got another time,</v>

1903
00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:02.190
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1904
00:52:02.190 --> 00:52:04.790
<v Speaker 1>you got a half an hour worth of fucking commercials in an hour.</v>

1905
00:52:04.940 --> 00:52:05.960
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

1906
00:52:06.380 --> 00:52:08.380
<v Speaker 1>But it's almost getting to that point with,</v>

1907
00:52:08.430 --> 00:52:10.010
<v Speaker 1>with a lot of these radio stations,</v>

1908
00:52:10.460 --> 00:52:11.720
<v Speaker 1>they just have so much.</v>

1909
00:52:11.721 --> 00:52:11.961
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

1910
00:52:11.961 --> 00:52:12.920
<v Speaker 1>it's so crazy.</v>

1911
00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:14.271
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1912
00:52:14.271 --> 00:52:15.440
<v Speaker 1>I do it out of pure,</v>

1913
00:52:15.441 --> 00:52:15.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1914
00:52:15.980 --> 00:52:17.780
<v Speaker 1>how easy it is in my car.</v>

1915
00:52:17.781 --> 00:52:18.051
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1916
00:52:18.051 --> 00:52:18.391
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

1917
00:52:18.391 --> 00:52:19.161
<v Speaker 1>she turned the car,</v>

1918
00:52:19.161 --> 00:52:20.060
<v Speaker 1>the radio turns on.</v>

1919
00:52:20.060 --> 00:52:20.451
<v Speaker 1>You don't have,</v>

1920
00:52:20.451 --> 00:52:20.691
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1921
00:52:20.691 --> 00:52:22.640
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of like background noise to a point.</v>

1922
00:52:22.710 --> 00:52:22.951
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1923
00:52:22.951 --> 00:52:24.470
<v Speaker 1>That's the only reason I listened to radio.</v>

1924
00:52:24.471 --> 00:52:28.890
<v Speaker 1>If it gets to the point where it just automatically turns on my Spotify my card,</v>

1925
00:52:28.891 --> 00:52:30.890
<v Speaker 1>then I will,</v>

1926
00:52:31.220 --> 00:52:31.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1927
00:52:31.730 --> 00:52:33.860
<v Speaker 1>serious is so much better in that sense.</v>

1928
00:52:33.861 --> 00:52:35.660
<v Speaker 1>Like when I listened to opiod Jimmy,</v>

1929
00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:36.800
<v Speaker 1>it's like they're swearing,</v>

1930
00:52:37.700 --> 00:52:38.840
<v Speaker 1>they're being honest and swearing.</v>

1931
00:52:38.841 --> 00:52:40.850
<v Speaker 1>But even then you have to worry about being fired.</v>

1932
00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:45.380
<v Speaker 1>They have to worry about some sort of a public outrage situation when they say</v>

1933
00:52:45.381 --> 00:52:48.600
<v Speaker 1>something crazy and people demand their ouster and the,</v>

1934
00:52:48.601 --> 00:52:51.320
<v Speaker 1>the heads will roll and the corporation has to bow down.</v>

1935
00:52:51.530 --> 00:52:51.861
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1936
00:52:51.861 --> 00:52:52.161
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1937
00:52:52.161 --> 00:52:52.520
<v Speaker 1>we've,</v>

1938
00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:57.290
<v Speaker 1>we've reviewed your file and we've found that this is not the first time you</v>

1939
00:52:57.291 --> 00:52:58.520
<v Speaker 1>said anything outrageous.</v>

1940
00:52:59.030 --> 00:52:59.591
<v Speaker 1>Anthony Ku,</v>

1941
00:52:59.591 --> 00:53:00.200
<v Speaker 1>Mia,</v>

1942
00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:00.411
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1943
00:53:00.411 --> 00:53:00.570
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1944
00:53:00.570 --> 00:53:01.970
<v Speaker 1>well that's what he got paid for,</v>

1945
00:53:02.430 --> 00:53:02.721
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1946
00:53:02.721 --> 00:53:03.231
<v Speaker 1>and they were like,</v>

1947
00:53:03.231 --> 00:53:04.064
<v Speaker 1>you're out.</v>

1948
00:53:04.130 --> 00:53:07.650
<v Speaker 1>Like he tweeted a bunch of horrible shit where really the,</v>

1949
00:53:07.710 --> 00:53:09.800
<v Speaker 1>the great thing would be to do,</v>

1950
00:53:09.950 --> 00:53:14.950
<v Speaker 1>to have him come in and justify what he said or explain himself or apologize on</v>

1951
00:53:16.911 --> 00:53:20.840
<v Speaker 1>the air or say he was drunk or address it the way he would have dressed it.</v>

1952
00:53:21.530 --> 00:53:22.730
<v Speaker 1>And if he did do that,</v>

1953
00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:24.380
<v Speaker 1>the fucking ratings would be giant.</v>

1954
00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:26.680
<v Speaker 1>Like if they were smart about their,</v>

1955
00:53:26.681 --> 00:53:27.480
<v Speaker 1>their business,</v>

1956
00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:28.380
<v Speaker 1>the business model,</v>

1957
00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:29.580
<v Speaker 1>that's how they would handle it.</v>

1958
00:53:29.790 --> 00:53:29.851
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1959
00:53:29.851 --> 00:53:30.121
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1960
00:53:30.121 --> 00:53:32.850
<v Speaker 1>you've got a builtin ratings boost right there.</v>

1961
00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:34.140
<v Speaker 1>Let people talk more about it.</v>

1962
00:53:34.230 --> 00:53:35.580
<v Speaker 1>Have people bitch more.</v>

1963
00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:35.891

00:53:35.891 --> 00:53:36.930
<v Speaker 1>you should do is tweet some.</v>

1965
00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:37.890
<v Speaker 1>You should.</v>

1966
00:53:37.890 --> 00:53:41.130
<v Speaker 1>You should have a sock puppet account where you tweet some of the other</v>

1967
00:53:41.131 --> 00:53:43.770
<v Speaker 1>outrageous shit that he said over the past five years.</v>

1970
00:53:47.580 --> 00:53:48.720
<v Speaker 1>It's only going to help.</v>

1971
00:53:49.020 --> 00:53:51.780
<v Speaker 1>It's only going to help is going to get more people pissed off.</v>

1972
00:53:51.810 --> 00:53:52.201
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1973
00:53:52.201 --> 00:53:53.940
<v Speaker 1>Is it going to get more people to call up?</v>

1974
00:53:53.941 --> 00:53:54.231
<v Speaker 1>Your said,</v>

00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:56.940
<v Speaker 1>Are you really?</v>

1977
00:53:57.150 --> 00:53:58.380
<v Speaker 1>If that's all it takes,</v>

1978
00:53:58.500 --> 00:54:00.120
<v Speaker 1>it's all it takes for you to cancel serious.</v>

1979
00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:01.410
<v Speaker 1>Fuck off.</v>

1980
00:54:01.590 --> 00:54:02.730
<v Speaker 1>Get out of here.</v>

1981
00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:07.880
<v Speaker 1>One guy says a few retarded things after he gets drunk and some stripper or a</v>

1982
00:54:08.671 --> 00:54:09.091
<v Speaker 1>hooker.</v>

1983
00:54:09.091 --> 00:54:09.924
<v Speaker 1>I guess she was a hooker.</v>

1984
00:54:09.990 --> 00:54:13.650
<v Speaker 1>Beats him up while he's holding a gun and he doesn't do anything about it like,</v>

1985
00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:13.951
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>

1986
00:54:13.951 --> 00:54:14.880
<v Speaker 1>It's a great story.</v>

1987
00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:17.430
<v Speaker 1>If that's what's going to get you to quit serious,</v>

1988
00:54:17.770 --> 00:54:18.870
<v Speaker 1>think go quit bitch.</v>

1989
00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:20.100
<v Speaker 1>They need to be able to say that.</v>

1990
00:54:20.130 --> 00:54:20.963
<v Speaker 1>Go quit.</v>

1991
00:54:22.170 --> 00:54:23.040
<v Speaker 1>It's a dead model.</v>

1992
00:54:23.240 --> 00:54:24.073
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1993
00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:26.670
<v Speaker 1>That's a just a better version of the dead model.</v>

1994
00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:27.810
<v Speaker 1>What they are as like,</v>

1995
00:54:28.530 --> 00:54:29.880
<v Speaker 1>they're like a Betamax.</v>

1996
00:54:30.750 --> 00:54:32.250
<v Speaker 1>Like the VHS was doomed.</v>

1997
00:54:32.290 --> 00:54:33.420
<v Speaker 1>Didn't even know it was doomed.</v>

1998
00:54:33.421 --> 00:54:37.610
<v Speaker 1>It was like a little bridge before we can get to digital media and the Beta was</v>

1999
00:54:37.620 --> 00:54:38.453
<v Speaker 1>just better.</v>

2000
00:54:38.850 --> 00:54:40.140
<v Speaker 1>It's like a better bridge.</v>

2001
00:54:40.220 --> 00:54:41.580
<v Speaker 1>Beta Max was way better,</v>

2002
00:54:41.730 --> 00:54:43.530
<v Speaker 1>better quality in wars,</v>

2003
00:54:43.590 --> 00:54:45.480
<v Speaker 1>but more in a laserdisc even better.</v>

2004
00:54:45.570 --> 00:54:46.670
<v Speaker 1>That's even better than DVD.</v>

2005
00:54:47.210 --> 00:54:48.043
<v Speaker 1>How about Blueray?</v>

2006
00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:49.290
<v Speaker 1>Blue Egg can go fuck itself.</v>

2007
00:54:49.620 --> 00:54:50.870
<v Speaker 1>How about that cause you,</v>

2008
00:54:50.900 --> 00:54:51.870
<v Speaker 1>it's so amazing.</v>

2009
00:54:51.871 --> 00:54:52.590
<v Speaker 1>Look at the quality.</v>

2010
00:54:52.590 --> 00:54:53.250
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

2011

<v Speaker 1>I could stream movies instantly and don't I have to hold your stupid Frisbee?</v>

2014
00:54:58.410 --> 00:54:59.160

<v Speaker 1>That model doesn't work anymore.</v>

2021

2031
00:55:27.770 --> 00:55:29.680

<v Speaker 1>he was a rebel and he broadcasted even though he wasn't supposed to,</v>

2033

<v Speaker 1>he was like turn it up or something like that.</v>

00:55:44.690 --> 00:55:45.900
<v Speaker 1>That's what he was doing.</v>

2037
00:55:45.990 --> 00:55:46.690
<v Speaker 1>What he was doing.</v>

2038
00:55:46.690 --> 00:55:49.470
<v Speaker 1>Was it just a really low rent podcast?</v>

2039
00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:50.940
<v Speaker 1>You know he was,</v>

2040

<v Speaker 1>I'm going to play real music,</v>

2041
00:55:52.591 --> 00:55:53.160
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Don't change the world.</v>

2047
00:55:59.700 --> 00:56:02.700
<v Speaker 1>Nothing serious radio being able to sweat it doesn't change the world.</v>

2048
00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:03.713
<v Speaker 1>They get mites.</v>

2049
00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:07.140
<v Speaker 1>The culture is slowly going to devolve when people are allowed to communicate</v>

2050
00:56:07.141 --> 00:56:07.830
<v Speaker 1>with each other.</v>

2051
00:56:07.830 --> 00:56:10.260
<v Speaker 1>But the idea that like one guy's going to start a revolution.</v>

2052
00:56:10.350 --> 00:56:12.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to tell the truth with my radio show.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Your bone structure is too perfect.</v>

2056
00:56:16.550 --> 00:56:19.170
<v Speaker 1>You have wonderful hair and the movie you're in sucks.</v>

2057
00:56:19.500 --> 00:56:20.370

2058
00:56:20.700 --> 00:56:21.910

2064
00:56:30.310 --> 00:56:32.390
<v Speaker 3>I guess that's supposed to be a cell phone right now.</v>

2065
00:56:32.610 --> 00:56:33.280

<v Speaker 3>I bet a lot of people listen to this podcast and uh,</v>

2074
00:56:46.121 --> 00:56:47.380
<v Speaker 3>their parents find out about it.</v>

<v Speaker 3>And then there was a UHF and VHF and UHF VHF.</v>

2154
00:59:09.390 --> 00:59:10.900
<v Speaker 3>UHF was like the,</v>

2155
00:59:10.930 --> 00:59:13.260
<v Speaker 3>the one of them was like the good channels.</v>

2156
00:59:13.320 --> 00:59:13.770
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2157
00:59:13.770 --> 00:59:15.930
<v Speaker 3>And the other one was like Benny Hill and am radio.</v>

2158
00:59:18.540 --> 00:59:20.880
<v Speaker 3>Remember Benny Hill wasn't on the regular TV.</v>

2159
00:59:20.881 --> 00:59:21.350
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>

2160
00:59:21.350 --> 00:59:22.340
<v Speaker 3>he was on the bullshit</v>

2161
00:59:22.700 --> 00:59:23.533
<v Speaker 4>networks.</v>

2162
00:59:24.900 --> 00:59:25.970
<v Speaker 4>I forgot all about that though.</v>

2163
00:59:26.780 --> 00:59:27.613
<v Speaker 4>I did too.</v>

2164
00:59:28.480 --> 00:59:28.970
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2165
00:59:28.970 --> 00:59:29.803
<v Speaker 4>I do too.</v>

2166
00:59:30.580 --> 00:59:31.040
<v Speaker 4>There's a whole,</v>

2167
00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:33.530
<v Speaker 4>there's a fucking hilarious harm movie called VHS.</v>

2168
00:59:33.960 --> 00:59:37.820
<v Speaker 4>It's like one of those found footage ones where these people,</v>

2169
00:59:37.880 --> 00:59:40.520
<v Speaker 4>but the first one is actually pretty fucking cool.</v>

2170
00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:42.500
<v Speaker 4>It's one of those movies like God damn it,</v>

2171
00:59:42.501 --> 00:59:43.760
<v Speaker 4>if you could keep this up,</v>

2172
00:59:44.240 --> 00:59:46.130
<v Speaker 4>if you could keep this up through the whole movie,</v>

2173
00:59:46.280 --> 00:59:48.830
<v Speaker 4>it'll be pretty bad ass cause it's a bunch of stories.</v>

2174
00:59:49.070 --> 00:59:49.910
<v Speaker 4>And the first one,</v>

2175
00:59:49.940 --> 00:59:51.470
<v Speaker 4>spoiler alert,</v>

2176
00:59:51.740 --> 00:59:55.340
<v Speaker 4>the first one is about a girl who's a demon and this guy picks his girl up at a</v>

2177
00:59:55.341 --> 00:59:56.720
<v Speaker 4>club but she uh,</v>

2178
00:59:56.750 --> 01:00:00.020
<v Speaker 4>she turns out to be a demon but it's actually like really well done.</v>

2179
01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:00.590
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of,</v>

2180
01:00:00.590 --> 01:00:01.430
<v Speaker 4>it's freaky.</v>

2181
01:00:01.610 --> 01:00:05.960
<v Speaker 4>They're drunk and they pick her up and she's got like these really weird feet</v>

2182
01:00:06.020 --> 01:00:07.820
<v Speaker 4>and then they realize like something's wrong with her.</v>

2183
01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.680
<v Speaker 4>But she keeps telling them that she loves him,</v>

2184
01:00:09.681 --> 01:00:10.281
<v Speaker 4>she loves him.</v>

2185
01:00:10.281 --> 01:00:10.491
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

2186
01:00:10.491 --> 01:00:11.390
<v Speaker 4>it's really good.</v>

2187
01:00:11.810 --> 01:00:14.060
<v Speaker 4>But it's only like watch it for 20 minutes,</v>

2188
01:00:14.061 --> 01:00:16.970
<v Speaker 4>watch that first one and then throw that fucking thing out the window.</v>

2189
01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.080
<v Speaker 4>If you have an actual copy,</v>

2190
01:00:18.610 --> 01:00:19.520
<v Speaker 4>a physical copy,</v>

2191
01:00:19.550 --> 01:00:20.383
<v Speaker 4>Blu Ray,</v>

2192
01:00:20.950 --> 01:00:22.010
<v Speaker 4>do you have a blue ray?</v>

2193
01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:27.980
<v Speaker 4>That was the other thing is they fucked up with their protocol battles with like</v>

2194
01:00:27.981 --> 01:00:32.510
<v Speaker 4>blue ray and I have a bunch of DVDs that are HD DVDs.</v>

2195
01:00:32.511 --> 01:00:33.740
<v Speaker 4>You can't watch on anything.</v>

2196
01:00:34.130 --> 01:00:35.120
<v Speaker 4>I got a bunch of them.</v>

2197
01:00:35.121 --> 01:00:36.170
<v Speaker 4>I got a player if you want.</v>

2198
01:00:37.130 --> 01:00:38.000
<v Speaker 4>I don't even,</v>

2199
01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:39.980
<v Speaker 4>you could get them all on digital now,</v>

2200
01:00:40.370 --> 01:00:41.203
<v Speaker 4>but that's,</v>

2201
01:00:41.210 --> 01:00:42.043
<v Speaker 4>see,</v>

2202
01:00:42.290 --> 01:00:45.320
<v Speaker 4>that'll be the demise of our knowledge.</v>

2203
01:00:45.710 --> 01:00:47.990
<v Speaker 4>That's what's going to happen if,</v>

2204
01:00:48.230 --> 01:00:49.190
<v Speaker 4>if you just look,</v>

2205
01:00:49.700 --> 01:00:51.710
<v Speaker 4>if you pay attention to what,</v>

2206
01:00:51.711 --> 01:00:52.061
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>

2207
01:00:52.061 --> 01:00:55.070
<v Speaker 4>when people talk about the possibilities of natural disasters,</v>

2208
01:00:55.071 --> 01:00:59.000
<v Speaker 4>like somebody just posted this on the message board the other day that a America</v>

2209
01:00:59.030 --> 01:01:00.070
<v Speaker 4>is basically a,</v>

2210
01:01:00.090 --> 01:01:01.340
<v Speaker 4>a ticking time bomb.</v>

2211
01:01:01.340 --> 01:01:03.110
<v Speaker 4>It's based on some article that someone wrote.</v>

2212
01:01:03.111 --> 01:01:04.460
<v Speaker 4>Maybe I'll pull it up real quick,</v>

2213
01:01:04.790 --> 01:01:05.300
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>

2214
01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:06.490
<v Speaker 4>it was based on CVE.</v>

2215
01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:07.333
<v Speaker 4>Find the Jamie,</v>

2216
01:01:07.490 --> 01:01:09.140
<v Speaker 4>but I think it's in the,</v>

2217
01:01:09.141 --> 01:01:09.890
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2218
01:01:09.890 --> 01:01:12.590
<v Speaker 4>the main form might be in the podcast form,</v>

2219
01:01:12.950 --> 01:01:17.900
<v Speaker 4>but the idea was that there's this giant culture of entitled people.</v>

2220
01:01:18.110 --> 01:01:22.100
<v Speaker 4>Nobody knows how to do anything for self sustaining.</v>

2221
01:01:22.340 --> 01:01:24.080
<v Speaker 4>Nobody knows how to grow their own food.</v>

2222
01:01:24.081 --> 01:01:25.430
<v Speaker 4>Nobody knows how to get water.</v>

2223
01:01:25.850 --> 01:01:29.060
<v Speaker 4>And we live in these giant population centers.</v>

2224
01:01:29.061 --> 01:01:30.920
<v Speaker 4>America is a bomb waiting to explode.</v>

2225
01:01:30.921 --> 01:01:31.754
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>

2226
01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:32.660
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

2227
01:01:32.660 --> 01:01:34.760
<v Speaker 4>it makes them really fucking good points.</v>

2228
01:01:34.970 --> 01:01:35.541
<v Speaker 4>Like when you,</v>

2229
01:01:35.541 --> 01:01:36.470
<v Speaker 4>when you go over it,</v>

2230
01:01:36.471 --> 01:01:37.730
<v Speaker 4>it makes some really good points.</v>

2231
01:01:37.731 --> 01:01:41.810
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of freaky when you stop and think about how many different things we</v>

2232
01:01:41.811 --> 01:01:46.610
<v Speaker 4>rely on that are hanging by a thread that easily could be taken out by a power</v>

2233
01:01:46.611 --> 01:01:47.300
<v Speaker 4>grid.</v>

2234
01:01:47.300 --> 01:01:49.280
<v Speaker 4>But when you think about our knowledge,</v>

2235
01:01:49.820 --> 01:01:50.780
<v Speaker 4>if we do,</v>

2236
01:01:50.781 --> 01:01:52.010
<v Speaker 4>if something does happen,</v>

2237
01:01:52.011 --> 01:01:55.850
<v Speaker 4>a solar flare or asteroid impact that wipes out,</v>

2238
01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:58.970
<v Speaker 4>say 20% of the population stops the power.</v>

2239
01:01:58.970 --> 01:02:00.050
<v Speaker 4>And Man,</v>

2240
01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:00.560
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>

2241
01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:02.300
<v Speaker 4>if all of our shit breaks,</v>

2242
01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:04.580
<v Speaker 4>if we lost half the people on earth,</v>

2243
01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:07.190
<v Speaker 4>if all of our shit stops working,</v>

2244
01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:09.380
<v Speaker 4>computer stop working and we really,</v>

2245
01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:12.890
<v Speaker 4>we have to live like the early settlers,</v>

2246
01:02:12.950 --> 01:02:14.270
<v Speaker 4>like people are still alive.</v>

2247
01:02:14.450 --> 01:02:17.180
<v Speaker 4>The people that are alive today still have the,</v>

2248
01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:21.270
<v Speaker 4>the knowledge that they have of live in 30 plus years with,</v>

2249
01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:21.870
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2250
01:02:21.870 --> 01:02:26.010
<v Speaker 4>the education system and all the technology that's in place today.</v>

2251
01:02:26.340 --> 01:02:27.720
<v Speaker 4>These people still out stop.</v>

2252
01:02:27.870 --> 01:02:29.280
<v Speaker 4>These people still have those things.</v>

2253
01:02:29.281 --> 01:02:30.114
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2254
01:02:31.110 --> 01:02:31.943
<v Speaker 4>How,</v>

2255
01:02:32.130 --> 01:02:32.963
<v Speaker 4>how much,</v>

2256
01:02:33.390 --> 01:02:35.040
<v Speaker 4>how long could you use what we have?</v>

2257
01:02:35.250 --> 01:02:36.140
<v Speaker 4>Like how long could you,</v>

2258
01:02:36.141 --> 01:02:37.110
<v Speaker 4>well you don't have any power,</v>

2259
01:02:37.290 --> 01:02:38.850
<v Speaker 4>how are you gonna be able to generate power?</v>

2260
01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:40.170
<v Speaker 4>Some people might be able to,</v>

2261
01:02:40.350 --> 01:02:44.370
<v Speaker 4>they might be like a few people with propane generators and still work and some</v>

2262
01:02:44.371 --> 01:02:48.990
<v Speaker 4>people might be figuring out how to rig solar or create batteries are used,</v>

2263
01:02:48.991 --> 01:02:49.980
<v Speaker 4>the batteries that we have,</v>

2264
01:02:49.981 --> 01:02:54.981
<v Speaker 4>but all large scale industrial shit would be stopped.</v>

2265
01:02:56.070 --> 01:02:59.250
<v Speaker 4>All construction and manufacturing would cease and desist.</v>

2266
01:02:59.700 --> 01:03:04.080
<v Speaker 4>And then all of our knowledge that's on these fucking computers and hard drives</v>

2267
01:03:04.230 --> 01:03:05.250
<v Speaker 4>in accessible.</v>

2268
01:03:05.380 --> 01:03:08.830
<v Speaker 2>When I was at a and Ohio a couple of years ago for Christmas break,</v>

2269
01:03:08.950 --> 01:03:09.400
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2270
01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:11.890
<v Speaker 2>maybe for about a week there is a really bad winter storm,</v>

2271
01:03:11.891 --> 01:03:12.551
<v Speaker 2>like an ice storm.</v>

2272
01:03:12.551 --> 01:03:16.390
<v Speaker 2>Homeless and power was out almost for the large part of the state for almost an</v>

2273
01:03:16.391 --> 01:03:17.320
<v Speaker 2>entire whole week.</v>

2274
01:03:17.630 --> 01:03:18.640
<v Speaker 2>I thought about that recently.</v>

2275
01:03:18.641 --> 01:03:19.540
<v Speaker 2>If that happened here,</v>

2276
01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:20.920
<v Speaker 2>even for three days,</v>

2277
01:03:21.310 --> 01:03:22.630
<v Speaker 2>this place would almost fall apart.</v>

2278
01:03:22.631 --> 01:03:24.100
<v Speaker 2>If there is no power in Los Angeles,</v>

2279
01:03:24.460 --> 01:03:25.270
<v Speaker 2>a couple of days,</v>

2280
01:03:25.270 --> 01:03:26.410
<v Speaker 2>people are so soft</v>

2281
01:03:26.670 --> 01:03:27.710
<v Speaker 4>is fuck here.</v>

2282
01:03:27.711 --> 01:03:28.251
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>

2283
01:03:28.251 --> 01:03:29.240
<v Speaker 4>soft as fuck.</v>

2284
01:03:29.450 --> 01:03:30.283
<v Speaker 4>Second of all,</v>

2285
01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:31.610
<v Speaker 4>they wouldn't be able to keep food.</v>

2286
01:03:31.740 --> 01:03:32.810
<v Speaker 4>The difference between Ohio,</v>

2287
01:03:32.820 --> 01:03:36.020
<v Speaker 4>you could put your food out in the garage and it's cold as shit and it would</v>

2288
01:03:36.060 --> 01:03:36.430
<v Speaker 4>stay,</v>

2289
01:03:36.430 --> 01:03:37.430
<v Speaker 4>stay cold out there.</v>

2290
01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:38.211
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>

2291
01:03:38.211 --> 01:03:38.810
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2292
01:03:38.810 --> 01:03:40.490
<v Speaker 4>in the wintertime out here,</v>

2293
01:03:40.491 --> 01:03:43.160
<v Speaker 4>it's still 70 degrees and your food's gonna rot in a day.</v>

2294
01:03:45.540 --> 01:03:46.351
<v Speaker 2>In that article,</v>

2295
01:03:46.351 --> 01:03:51.270
<v Speaker 2>he said one of the things that is holding on by a thread is the use of mine</v>

2296
01:03:51.271 --> 01:03:52.260
<v Speaker 2>altering drugs.</v>

2297
01:03:52.261 --> 01:03:53.160
<v Speaker 2>What was that all about?</v>

2298
01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:53.480
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2299
01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:53.870
<v Speaker 4>I dunno,</v>

2300
01:03:53.870 --> 01:03:54.920
<v Speaker 4>I didn't read the whole thing.</v>

2301
01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:55.311
<v Speaker 4>Maybe,</v>

2302
01:03:55.311 --> 01:03:58.910
<v Speaker 4>probably if you talk about antidepressants number three,</v>

2303
01:03:59.780 --> 01:04:01.370
<v Speaker 4>FDA approved narcotics.</v>

2304
01:04:01.430 --> 01:04:01.940
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2305
01:04:01.940 --> 01:04:04.300
<v Speaker 4>well there's a lot of that re uptake in he,</v>

2306
01:04:04.301 --> 01:04:04.940
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2307
01:04:04.940 --> 01:04:07.610
<v Speaker 4>Selective Serotonin reuptake inhibitors,</v>

2308
01:04:07.611 --> 01:04:08.444
<v Speaker 4>Ssri,</v>

2309
01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:10.090
<v Speaker 4>those are antidepressants.</v>

2310
01:04:11.260 --> 01:04:16.260
<v Speaker 4>Pop US population was up 400% of late two thousands over the 1990s.</v>

2311
01:04:16.790 --> 01:04:21.230
<v Speaker 4>Many of these drugs are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.</v>

2312
01:04:21.860 --> 01:04:24.020
<v Speaker 4>These are the type the FDA approved narcotics,</v>

2313
01:04:24.021 --> 01:04:26.120
<v Speaker 4>lone gunmen are frequently associated with,</v>

2314
01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:27.433
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2315
01:04:27.500 --> 01:04:31.610
<v Speaker 4>that's so true that there's a giant percentage of people that wind up shooting</v>

2316
01:04:31.611 --> 01:04:34.070
<v Speaker 4>people that are on antidepressants.</v>

2317
01:04:34.460 --> 01:04:36.080
<v Speaker 4>But in all fairness,</v>

2318
01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:36.381
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2319
01:04:36.381 --> 01:04:36.891
<v Speaker 4>there's that,</v>

2320
01:04:36.891 --> 01:04:37.724
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2321
01:04:37.970 --> 01:04:38.751
<v Speaker 4>causation,</v>

2322
01:04:38.751 --> 01:04:41.210
<v Speaker 4>causality paradigm like that.</v>

2323
01:04:41.211 --> 01:04:41.510
<v Speaker 4>Co,</v>

2324
01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:42.050
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2325
01:04:42.050 --> 01:04:44.540
<v Speaker 4>causation does not equal causality.</v>

2326
01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:49.280
<v Speaker 4>The idea that something happening like just because these two things are</v>

2327
01:04:49.340 --> 01:04:50.390
<v Speaker 4>combined together,</v>

2328
01:04:50.391 --> 01:04:52.070
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't mean that thing caused that thing.</v>

2329
01:04:52.250 --> 01:04:54.470
<v Speaker 4>And there's other factors that you have to prove.</v>

2330
01:04:54.770 --> 01:04:56.630
<v Speaker 4>I know people are saying your butcher in that right now.</v>

2331
01:04:56.690 --> 01:04:57.620
<v Speaker 4>I know I'm butchering it,</v>

2332
01:04:57.950 --> 01:05:00.060
<v Speaker 4>but there's other factors that people have to um,</v>

2333
01:05:00.350 --> 01:05:01.340
<v Speaker 4>take into consideration.</v>

2334
01:05:01.550 --> 01:05:05.360
<v Speaker 4>One of the big factors is why was the guy on antidepressants in the first place?</v>

2335
01:05:05.361 --> 01:05:08.090
<v Speaker 4>Why was the guy on antipsychotic medication in the first place?</v>

2336
01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:08.931
<v Speaker 4>If he's on it,</v>

2337
01:05:08.931 --> 01:05:10.550
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't mean the medication made him do that.</v>

2338
01:05:10.551 --> 01:05:13.550
<v Speaker 4>And it might be mean he's fucking crazy and that's why he's taking shit.</v>

2339
01:05:13.551 --> 01:05:15.230
<v Speaker 4>And that's why eventually wound up killing somebody.</v>

2340
01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:16.730
<v Speaker 4>But it could be that too.</v>

2341
01:05:16.990 --> 01:05:18.340
<v Speaker 4>It could be that.</v>

2342
01:05:18.520 --> 01:05:23.380
<v Speaker 4>And it also could be that the SSRS with certain people have an effect that makes</v>

2343
01:05:23.381 --> 01:05:25.510
<v Speaker 4>them less likely to feel,</v>

2344
01:05:25.660 --> 01:05:26.080
<v Speaker 4>they don't,</v>

2345
01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:26.470
<v Speaker 4>they don't,</v>

2346
01:05:26.470 --> 01:05:29.860
<v Speaker 4>they don't freak out about stuff as much and it might make things acceptable to</v>

2347
01:05:29.861 --> 01:05:30.430
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>

2348
01:05:30.430 --> 01:05:31.630
<v Speaker 4>including violence.</v>

2349
01:05:31.670 --> 01:05:31.890
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

2350
01:05:31.890 --> 01:05:32.681
<v Speaker 4>that's the rub.</v>

2351
01:05:32.681 --> 01:05:33.850
<v Speaker 4>That's the scary thing.</v>

2352
01:05:34.570 --> 01:05:36.960
<v Speaker 4>Especially if you combine them with other shit like a,</v>

2353
01:05:36.970 --> 01:05:38.380
<v Speaker 4>I know Phil Hartman's family,</v>

2354
01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:43.560
<v Speaker 4>they won money from Zoloft because Zoloft allegedly I wasn't there.</v>

2355
01:05:43.751 --> 01:05:44.501
<v Speaker 4>And when the court happened,</v>

2356
01:05:44.501 --> 01:05:44.770
<v Speaker 4>I might,</v>

2357
01:05:44.770 --> 01:05:47.440
<v Speaker 4>I have to say allegedly was what I read on the Internet.</v>

2358
01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:49.510
<v Speaker 4>I'm pretty sure it's the case though,</v>

2359
01:05:50.170 --> 01:05:50.951
<v Speaker 4>because she was,</v>

2360
01:05:50.951 --> 01:05:51.340
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2361
01:05:51.340 --> 01:05:53.020
<v Speaker 4>doing Zoloft when she shot him.</v>

2362
01:05:53.350 --> 01:05:57.070
<v Speaker 4>And that if you take Zoloft and you combine it with recreational drugs,</v>

2363
01:05:57.071 --> 01:05:59.320
<v Speaker 4>especially alcohol and cocaine,</v>

2364
01:05:59.890 --> 01:06:03.610
<v Speaker 4>especially cocaine is supposed to make you like really nutty when you're,</v>

2365
01:06:03.611 --> 01:06:03.850
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2366
01:06:03.850 --> 01:06:05.560
<v Speaker 4>doing coke and Ssri is,</v>

2367
01:06:05.561 --> 01:06:08.440
<v Speaker 4>it's like very crazy combination.</v>

2368
01:06:09.030 --> 01:06:09.331
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2369
01:06:09.331 --> 01:06:09.680
<v Speaker 2>And if,</v>

2370
01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:10.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2371
01:06:10.350 --> 01:06:14.010
<v Speaker 2>we run out of depression pills or happy pills,</v>

2372
01:06:14.340 --> 01:06:14.731
<v Speaker 2>we're going to,</v>

2373
01:06:14.731 --> 01:06:16.380
<v Speaker 2>you don't really see that in the movies,</v>

2374
01:06:16.381 --> 01:06:20.800
<v Speaker 2>like a half the people are just going crazy and angry and depressed and sad.</v>

2375
01:06:21.210 --> 01:06:22.620
<v Speaker 2>You certainly could happen and it,</v>

2376
01:06:22.621 --> 01:06:23.454
<v Speaker 2>the road movies,</v>

2377
01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:24.041
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

2378
01:06:24.041 --> 01:06:24.310
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

2379
01:06:24.310 --> 01:06:26.500
<v Speaker 4>I'm worried about all that I'm worried about.</v>

2380
01:06:26.501 --> 01:06:27.070
<v Speaker 4>It's not like,</v>

2381
01:06:27.070 --> 01:06:27.341
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2382
01:06:27.341 --> 01:06:29.680
<v Speaker 4>you should know what you need to be worried about is this,</v>

2383
01:06:29.890 --> 01:06:30.161
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2384
01:06:30.161 --> 01:06:31.480
<v Speaker 4>people love to make that argument.</v>

2385
01:06:31.481 --> 01:06:31.571
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2386
01:06:31.571 --> 01:06:32.530
<v Speaker 4>you're missing the point.</v>

2387
01:06:32.531 --> 01:06:33.400
<v Speaker 4>The point is this.</v>

2388
01:06:33.580 --> 01:06:33.821
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2389
01:06:33.821 --> 01:06:34.960
<v Speaker 4>that's also the point.</v>

2390
01:06:35.260 --> 01:06:35.590
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

2391
01:06:35.590 --> 01:06:35.891
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2392
01:06:35.891 --> 01:06:38.230
<v Speaker 4>the world's not a black and white thing.</v>

2393
01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:40.240
<v Speaker 4>The world has a lot of points.</v>

2394
01:06:40.241 --> 01:06:45.070
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of areas that we need to look at when it comes to the way human</v>

2395
01:06:45.100 --> 01:06:48.970
<v Speaker 4>life is operating today and what we were required to keep it operating at this</v>

2396
01:06:48.971 --> 01:06:49.804
<v Speaker 4>level.</v>

2397
01:06:49.900 --> 01:06:52.990
<v Speaker 4>We need a lot of shit to think about what we need to run this podcast.</v>

2398
01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:53.921
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2399
01:06:53.921 --> 01:06:58.000
<v Speaker 4>we were talking about how it's such as small shoestring organization cause it's</v>

2400
01:06:58.001 --> 01:06:58.600
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>

2401
01:06:58.600 --> 01:06:59.080
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2402
01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:02.290
<v Speaker 4>just the three of us in this room and it's reaching all these people,</v>

2403
01:07:02.710 --> 01:07:05.320
<v Speaker 4>but you still need like Libson these still need,</v>

2404
01:07:05.350 --> 01:07:05.621
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2405
01:07:05.621 --> 01:07:08.950
<v Speaker 4>you need like hosts and you need websites and you need,</v>

2406
01:07:09.250 --> 01:07:11.550
<v Speaker 4>you need the fiber optic to be laid.</v>

2407
01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:12.070
<v Speaker 4>You need the,</v>

2408
01:07:12.070 --> 01:07:12.430
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2409
01:07:12.430 --> 01:07:14.350
<v Speaker 4>the ability to transmit.</v>

2410
01:07:14.351 --> 01:07:15.310
<v Speaker 4>You need electricity.</v>

2411
01:07:15.311 --> 01:07:17.440
<v Speaker 4>This like a lot of shit that has to be in play.</v>

2412
01:07:17.590 --> 01:07:19.090
<v Speaker 4>And then when the power goes out,</v>

2413
01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:21.610
<v Speaker 4>all of it stops.</v>

2414
01:07:21.910 --> 01:07:22.601
<v Speaker 4>All of it stops.</v>

2415
01:07:22.601 --> 01:07:25.030
<v Speaker 4>And the power goes out for a year or two years.</v>

2416
01:07:25.330 --> 01:07:27.250
<v Speaker 4>We might as well be living in Mad Max.</v>

2417
01:07:27.780 --> 01:07:28.840
<v Speaker 4>And that's a fact.</v>

2418
01:07:28.930 --> 01:07:31.030
<v Speaker 4>That's a fucking fact.</v>

2419
01:07:31.270 --> 01:07:35.200
<v Speaker 4>When people started getting desperate and their kids don't have any food and</v>

2420
01:07:35.201 --> 01:07:37.000
<v Speaker 4>we're trying to figure out how to get gas,</v>

2421
01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:37.610
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>

2422
01:07:37.610 --> 01:07:38.710
<v Speaker 4>shit is going to get ugly.</v>

2423
01:07:39.130 --> 01:07:39.970
<v Speaker 4>You better pack.</v>

2424
01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:41.290
<v Speaker 4>If they say,</v>

2425
01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:42.101
<v Speaker 4>ladies and gentlemen,</v>

2426
01:07:42.101 --> 01:07:45.400
<v Speaker 4>prepare for at least a year of no power,</v>

2427
01:07:45.790 --> 01:07:49.180
<v Speaker 4>you got a fucking head north immediately.</v>

2428
01:07:49.210 --> 01:07:51.610
<v Speaker 4>I mean fucking immediately.</v>

2429
01:07:51.820 --> 01:07:53.680
<v Speaker 4>I don't care what the traffic jams are like,</v>

2430
01:07:53.710 --> 01:07:54.910
<v Speaker 4>get out of here.</v>

2431
01:07:55.180 --> 01:07:56.170
<v Speaker 4>Get out of here.</v>

2432
01:07:56.200 --> 01:07:57.700
<v Speaker 4>Get out of here while you can.</v>

2433
01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:00.700
<v Speaker 4>You gotta get the fuck away from this powder keg.</v>

2434
01:08:00.701 --> 01:08:05.200
<v Speaker 4>Cause there's a lot of really dumb people here and a lot of poor people and a</v>

2435
01:08:05.201 --> 01:08:07.030
<v Speaker 4>lot of crime that,</v>

01:08:07.931 --> 01:08:10.540
<v Speaker 4>They're gonna keep the people in jail and make them starve to death the fuck</v>

2439

01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:18.280
<v Speaker 1>enough gas to get out of here to live somewhere.</v>

2443
01:08:18.980 --> 01:08:20.880
<v Speaker 1>It might even work that might not even work.</v>

2444
01:08:20.970 --> 01:08:21.803
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2445
01:08:22.020 --> 01:08:26.370
<v Speaker 1>It's just this is a terrible place to be if everything stops because there's too</v>

2446
01:08:26.371 --> 01:08:29.670
<v Speaker 1>many people and there's too many food requirements and it's too many entitled</v>

2447

<v Speaker 1>dumb dumbs here.</v>

2448
01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:33.960
<v Speaker 1>There's too many people that would just fuck it up for everybody.</v>

2449
01:08:33.961 --> 01:08:35.580
<v Speaker 1>When you look at things like the riots,</v>

2450
01:08:35.910 --> 01:08:37.080
<v Speaker 1>like the riots that happened,</v>

2451
01:08:37.620 --> 01:08:38.453
<v Speaker 1>granted,</v>

2452
01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:40.460
<v Speaker 1>they were reacting to uh,</v>

2453

2458
01:08:47.580 --> 01:08:52.580
<v Speaker 1>They saw one segment of a very long car chase and a prolonged fight with the</v>

2459
01:08:53.491 --> 01:08:54.210
<v Speaker 1>cops,</v>

2460
01:08:54.210 --> 01:08:57.540
<v Speaker 1>but in the segment they saw these cops are beating that guy with the fucking</v>

2461
01:08:57.541 --> 01:08:58.290

<v Speaker 1>everybody went nuts,</v>

2466
01:09:00.780 --> 01:09:04.560
<v Speaker 1>but they went nuts against people that had nothing to do with it.</v>

2467
01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:06.960
<v Speaker 1>They went nuts with people like they,</v>

2468
01:09:06.961 --> 01:09:09.990
<v Speaker 1>when they pulled that Reginald gent Denny out of the car and hit him in the head</v>

2469
01:09:09.991 --> 01:09:11.190
<v Speaker 1>with a brick on TV,</v>

2470
01:09:11.340 --> 01:09:12.510
<v Speaker 1>I'll never forget that.</v>

2471
01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:12.930

<v Speaker 1>that guy's out there right now,</v>

2473
01:09:14.820 --> 01:09:15.653
<v Speaker 1>that guy,</v>

2474
01:09:15.750 --> 01:09:17.040
<v Speaker 1>there's a guy like that guy,</v>

2475
01:09:17.070 --> 01:09:20.040
<v Speaker 1>whether it's that guy or specifically or a guy like him,</v>

2476
01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:24.090
<v Speaker 1>he's out there right now waiting for the green light waiting for it.</v>

2477
01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:25.290
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of them.</v>

2478
01:09:25.380 --> 01:09:26.430
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of them.</v>

2479
01:09:26.850 --> 01:09:28.920
<v Speaker 1>And when there's no food man,</v>

2480
01:09:28.921 --> 01:09:30.060
<v Speaker 1>no food and no water,</v>

2481
01:09:30.290 --> 01:09:30.601
<v Speaker 1>they are,</v>

2482
01:09:30.601 --> 01:09:35.040
<v Speaker 1>those are not good combinations and no gasoline to get the food or water to</v>

2483
01:09:35.041 --> 01:09:35.874
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

2484
01:09:36.420 --> 01:09:37.253
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

2485
01:09:37.290 --> 01:09:38.123
<v Speaker 1>Good luck.</v>

2486
01:09:39.180 --> 01:09:40.590
<v Speaker 1>So all this shit that we have,</v>

2487
01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:41.461
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2488
01:09:41.461 --> 01:09:41.731
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

2489
01:09:41.731 --> 01:09:44.010
<v Speaker 1>we're so amazed that our progress,</v>

2490
01:09:44.130 --> 01:09:44.550
<v Speaker 1>we're done.</v>

2491
01:09:44.550 --> 01:09:45.810
<v Speaker 1>We've done such an amazing job.</v>

2492
01:09:45.811 --> 01:09:46.141
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2493
01:09:46.141 --> 01:09:46.974
<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>

2494
01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:48.330
<v Speaker 1>But it could all go away.</v>

2495
01:09:48.750 --> 01:09:50.220
<v Speaker 1>It could go away real quick.</v>

2496
01:09:50.830 --> 01:09:54.120
<v Speaker 2>We're putting too much important things on our phones and our electronics.</v>

2497
01:09:54.121 --> 01:09:56.790
<v Speaker 2>Like if my phone dies right now and all the electricity goes out,</v>

2498
01:09:56.791 --> 01:09:58.170
<v Speaker 2>I don't have numbers to my,</v>

2499
01:09:58.260 --> 01:09:59.910
<v Speaker 2>my friends and my family.</v>

2500
01:09:59.911 --> 01:10:01.920
<v Speaker 2>I don't have any ways to contact them,</v>

2501
01:10:01.921 --> 01:10:02.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2502
01:10:02.100 --> 01:10:04.230
<v Speaker 2>or personal information and yeah,</v>

2503
01:10:04.380 --> 01:10:05.550
<v Speaker 2>I might know 10 numbers.</v>

2504
01:10:05.580 --> 01:10:06.150
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2505
01:10:06.150 --> 01:10:07.020
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know that.</v>

2506
01:10:07.260 --> 01:10:07.571
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

2507
01:10:07.571 --> 01:10:07.671
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2508
01:10:07.671 --> 01:10:08.360
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2509
01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:09.180
<v Speaker 2>and the other thing,</v>

2510
01:10:09.180 --> 01:10:11.970
<v Speaker 2>like I had my mom bought me one of those big medical books.</v>

2511
01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:12.301
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2512
01:10:12.301 --> 01:10:14.130
<v Speaker 2>that's something that you don't even think about.</v>

2513
01:10:14.131 --> 01:10:16.710
<v Speaker 2>Like if we have no internet and you get an infection,</v>

2514
01:10:17.010 --> 01:10:17.341
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2515
01:10:17.341 --> 01:10:18.330
<v Speaker 2>like you should know,</v>

2516
01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:18.601
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2517
01:10:18.601 --> 01:10:20.460
<v Speaker 2>poor alcohol and if you don't have alcohol,</v>

2518
01:10:20.461 --> 01:10:21.270
<v Speaker 2>pee on it and you know,</v>

2519
01:10:21.270 --> 01:10:22.410
<v Speaker 2>or whatever you have to do.</v>

2520
01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:22.860
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2521
01:10:22.860 --> 01:10:24.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm watching the showtime show,</v>

2522
01:10:24.601 --> 01:10:28.290
<v Speaker 1>the Nick Who's seen that showtime does some crazy shit,</v>

2523
01:10:28.291 --> 01:10:28.531
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2524
01:10:28.531 --> 01:10:29.364
<v Speaker 1>They have to,</v>

2525
01:10:29.610 --> 01:10:30.600
<v Speaker 1>they're like playboy.</v>

2526
01:10:31.020 --> 01:10:32.960
<v Speaker 1>Like nobody gives a fuck about them anymore.</v>

2527
01:10:32.961 --> 01:10:35.010
<v Speaker 1>They've got to do something gangster to get noticed.</v>

2528
01:10:35.820 --> 01:10:36.620
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

2529
01:10:36.620 --> 01:10:36.891
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2530
01:10:36.891 --> 01:10:38.280
<v Speaker 1>it's so graphic.</v>

2531
01:10:38.670 --> 01:10:39.420
<v Speaker 1>The guys,</v>

2532
01:10:39.420 --> 01:10:39.811
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

2533
01:10:39.811 --> 01:10:40.860
<v Speaker 1>it's totally unrealistic.</v>

2534
01:10:40.861 --> 01:10:43.920
<v Speaker 1>Like the guys suffering from massive cocaine withdrawals.</v>

2535
01:10:43.921 --> 01:10:44.191
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

2536
01:10:44.191 --> 01:10:46.350
<v Speaker 1>whole body's going to convulsions is about to die.</v>

2537
01:10:46.740 --> 01:10:48.810
<v Speaker 1>Every vein in his body's collapsed.</v>

2538
01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:49.890
<v Speaker 1>So she's got to try to find,</v>

2539
01:10:49.891 --> 01:10:53.160
<v Speaker 1>the nurse has to try to find a new vein to shoot cocaine into.</v>

2540
01:10:53.490 --> 01:10:55.740
<v Speaker 1>And once she does shoot the vein and he's fine,</v>

2541
01:10:55.950 --> 01:10:59.040
<v Speaker 1>now he's up in talking swift and knows his stuff.</v>

2542
01:10:59.130 --> 01:11:00.240
<v Speaker 1>He's the best.</v>

2543
01:11:00.330 --> 01:11:01.710
<v Speaker 1>This is what we're going to do.</v>

2544
01:11:01.860 --> 01:11:03.600
<v Speaker 1>I'll accept your resignation.</v>

2545
01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:04.231
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2546
01:11:04.231 --> 01:11:05.460
<v Speaker 1>like they like the way they,</v>

2547
01:11:05.490 --> 01:11:05.761
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2548
01:11:05.761 --> 01:11:07.020
<v Speaker 1>they do these operations,</v>

2549
01:11:07.021 --> 01:11:08.610
<v Speaker 1>he's like this mastermind genius.</v>

2550
01:11:08.610 --> 01:11:13.610
<v Speaker 1>But five minutes ago he was just spasming and flailing because he couldn't get</v>

2551
01:11:14.821 --> 01:11:16.830
<v Speaker 1>his cocaine and all his veins are collapsed.</v>

2552
01:11:17.190 --> 01:11:18.780
<v Speaker 1>They shoot it into him and now he's fine.</v>

2553
01:11:19.610 --> 01:11:21.120
<v Speaker 1>Can you see what's going on with homeland?</v>

2554
01:11:21.900 --> 01:11:22.790
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of hilarious.</v>

2555
01:11:22.791 --> 01:11:25.470
<v Speaker 1>And you were watched the artists that worked for homeland,</v>

2556

01:11:35.751 --> 01:11:36.230
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of,</v>

2563
01:11:36.230 --> 01:11:36.901
<v Speaker 1>it kind of interesting.</v>

2564
01:11:36.901 --> 01:11:37.740
<v Speaker 1>See if you can find the APP,</v>

2565
01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:38.970
<v Speaker 1>the actual images.</v>

2566
01:11:39.180 --> 01:11:40.080
<v Speaker 1>But what they did is,</v>

2567
01:11:40.081 --> 01:11:40.261
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2568
01:11:40.261 --> 01:11:41.094
<v Speaker 1>the artists were,</v>

2569
01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:45.000
<v Speaker 1>they were supposed to put images in the background.</v>

2570
01:11:45.150 --> 01:11:45.391
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2571
01:11:45.391 --> 01:11:47.050
<v Speaker 1>they create these environments.</v>

2572
01:11:47.051 --> 01:11:51.840
<v Speaker 1>They're supposed to look like Bangladesh or Nepal or wherever the fuck they want</v>

2573
01:11:51.841 --> 01:11:52.051
<v Speaker 1>to be.</v>

2574
01:11:52.051 --> 01:11:52.800
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2575
01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:54.930
<v Speaker 1>And when they have Arabic writing,</v>

2576
01:11:54.931 --> 01:11:58.020
<v Speaker 1>they have to bring in an artist to write the Arabic writing.</v>

2577
01:11:58.350 --> 01:12:01.890
<v Speaker 1>And what I tell these people are just writing shit cause they know that these</v>

2578
01:12:01.891 --> 01:12:06.510
<v Speaker 1>dummies can't read Arabic and they're not checking or double checking and</v>

2579
01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:07.500
<v Speaker 1>apparently,</v>

2580
01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:08.160
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2581
01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:10.560
<v Speaker 1>they get shit wrong all the time,</v>

2582
01:12:10.620 --> 01:12:14.130
<v Speaker 1>accusing homeland of racism appearing in the latest episode.</v>

2583
01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:19.440
<v Speaker 1>Apparently they get shit wrong about like alliances and conflicts.</v>

2584
01:12:19.441 --> 01:12:21.810
<v Speaker 1>They make stuff up in order to make the show better.</v>

2585
01:12:22.140 --> 01:12:22.973
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2586
01:12:23.370 --> 01:12:28.260
<v Speaker 1>The artist hired add authenticity to a refugee scene shot in Germany.</v>

2587
01:12:28.261 --> 01:12:32.910
<v Speaker 1>Also scrawled messages as homeland is a joke and it didn't make us laugh.</v>

2588
01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:35.940
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>

2589
01:12:37.110 --> 01:12:39.630
<v Speaker 1>We will get super sensitive about shows like that.</v>

2590
01:12:39.810 --> 01:12:40.643
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2591
01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:41.640
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with,</v>

2592
01:12:41.641 --> 01:12:42.474
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2593
01:12:43.140 --> 01:12:48.140
<v Speaker 1>a war torn world that specifically focuses on the most war torn aspects of the</v>

2594
01:12:49.861 --> 01:12:50.640
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

2595
01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:55.640
<v Speaker 1>All the places where the United States has military and they're battling</v>

2596
01:12:55.800 --> 01:12:58.860
<v Speaker 1>fundamentalists having these,</v>

2597
01:12:58.861 --> 01:12:59.430
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

2598
01:12:59.430 --> 01:12:59.731
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2599
01:12:59.731 --> 01:13:02.850
<v Speaker 1>these scenes and they're putting them in these fictional shows and they're</v>

2600
01:13:02.851 --> 01:13:06.510
<v Speaker 1>butchering the conflicts and there when you do stuff like that,</v>

2601
01:13:06.511 --> 01:13:06.870
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2602
01:13:06.870 --> 01:13:09.300
<v Speaker 1>like if you're doing a show about game of Thrones,</v>

2603
01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:10.770
<v Speaker 1>you can do whatever the fuck you want.</v>

2604
01:13:10.771 --> 01:13:13.200
<v Speaker 1>You know the seven kingdoms and you'd have dragons.</v>

2605
01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:16.560
<v Speaker 1>You know it's like Natasha is Sheryl calls to make 'em ups.</v>

2606
01:13:16.780 --> 01:13:17.071
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

2607
01:13:17.071 --> 01:13:18.540
<v Speaker 1>she doesn't like it cause it's like make,</v>

2608
01:13:18.620 --> 01:13:19.453
<v Speaker 1>it's a make them up.</v>

2609
01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:24.800
<v Speaker 1>But what I don't like about this kind of a show is like if you're fucking around</v>

2610
01:13:24.871 --> 01:13:27.060
<v Speaker 1>with the reality and if you,</v>

2611
01:13:27.061 --> 01:13:31.410
<v Speaker 1>if you twist the conflicts and you twist the alliances and you twist the,</v>

2612
01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:34.920
<v Speaker 1>the actual historical events in order to make your,</v>

2613
01:13:34.950 --> 01:13:35.251
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

2614
01:13:35.251 --> 01:13:37.110
<v Speaker 1>your show like more smooth.</v>

2615
01:13:37.410 --> 01:13:40.470
<v Speaker 1>The problem is people who are watching that show,</v>

2616
01:13:40.471 --> 01:13:41.520
<v Speaker 1>we're going to believe you.</v>

2617
01:13:41.860 --> 01:13:45.780
<v Speaker 1>Like I know you're pretending that it's is like this is just fiction but it's</v>

2618
01:13:45.781 --> 01:13:48.090
<v Speaker 1>about real parts of the world.</v>

2619
01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:50.340
<v Speaker 1>They should have like the thing at the beginning,</v>

2620
01:13:50.341 --> 01:13:52.770
<v Speaker 1>like the following program is yeah.</v>

2621
01:13:53.430 --> 01:13:56.550
<v Speaker 1>Cause Yeah I would watch that and think about the beginning.</v>

2622
01:13:56.560 --> 01:13:57.930
<v Speaker 1>You can tune in the middle.</v>

2623
01:13:58.170 --> 01:13:58.471
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2624
01:13:58.471 --> 01:13:59.161
<v Speaker 1>you come in,</v>

2625
01:13:59.161 --> 01:14:00.090
<v Speaker 1>you just took a shit.</v>

2626
01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:01.290
<v Speaker 1>It's five minutes in.</v>

2627
01:14:01.291 --> 01:14:01.471
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2628
01:14:01.471 --> 01:14:02.370
<v Speaker 1>I'll pay attention to this.</v>

2629
01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:03.001
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2630
01:14:03.001 --> 01:14:03.250
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>

2631
01:14:03.250 --> 01:14:06.180
<v Speaker 1>you missed all that stuff where they told you this bullshit,</v>

2632
01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:07.350
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

2633
01:14:07.351 --> 01:14:11.190
<v Speaker 1>they'll make stuff up in order to make their show more interesting or march</v>

2634
01:14:11.191 --> 01:14:12.024
<v Speaker 1>dramatic.</v>

2635
01:14:12.820 --> 01:14:13.653
<v Speaker 4>What are you doing over there?</v>

2636
01:14:13.830 --> 01:14:14.390
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2637
01:14:14.390 --> 01:14:19.390
<v Speaker 2>did you see the new technology where like me and you could be sitting in a room</v>

2638
01:14:19.701 --> 01:14:24.200
<v Speaker 2>next to each other in the TV and I can make you talk by using my facial features</v>

2639
01:14:24.201 --> 01:14:24.710
<v Speaker 2>and stuff.</v>

2640
01:14:24.710 --> 01:14:26.480
<v Speaker 2>You mean you can make the image of me?</v>

2641
01:14:26.481 --> 01:14:26.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2642
01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:27.560
<v Speaker 2>Image of you talk.</v>

2643
01:14:27.580 --> 01:14:28.413
<v Speaker 2>How,</v>

2644
01:14:28.490 --> 01:14:29.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's a game changer.</v>

2645
01:14:29.731 --> 01:14:29.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2646
01:14:29.930 --> 01:14:30.770
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty freaky.</v>

2647
01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:31.520
<v Speaker 2>Do you have that link?</v>

2648
01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:32.440
<v Speaker 2>I got this a,</v>

2649
01:14:32.550 --> 01:14:33.500
<v Speaker 2>I can just send this to you,</v>

2650
01:14:33.710 --> 01:14:34.380
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

2651
01:14:34.380 --> 01:14:38.840
<v Speaker 2>cause that like in the future we could be watching Obama on the TV and it</v>

2652
01:14:38.841 --> 01:14:40.640
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't even be him talking,</v>

2653
01:14:40.670 --> 01:14:41.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2654
01:14:41.450 --> 01:14:42.430
<v Speaker 2>it wouldn't be,</v>

2655
01:14:42.500 --> 01:14:44.750
<v Speaker 4>I had him making those facial expressions.</v>

2656
01:14:44.751 --> 01:14:47.090
<v Speaker 4>You can manipulate the image of someone's facial expression.</v>

2657
01:14:47.300 --> 01:14:47.930
<v Speaker 4>Like I could,</v>

2658
01:14:47.930 --> 01:14:51.950
<v Speaker 4>I could make you have duck lips and make you raise your eyebrows and,</v>

2659
01:14:52.220 --> 01:14:54.740
<v Speaker 4>and it would literally just alter your,</v>

2660
01:14:54.830 --> 01:14:57.880
<v Speaker 4>you're the face of your image to match the expressions that I'm making.</v>

2661
01:14:58.040 --> 01:14:58.340
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2662
01:14:58.340 --> 01:15:01.880
<v Speaker 2>Or if I wanted to have a voice,</v>

2663
01:15:02.060 --> 01:15:02.893
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2664
01:15:03.020 --> 01:15:03.890
<v Speaker 2>a copy of it.</v>

2665
01:15:03.891 --> 01:15:07.340
<v Speaker 2>Like I can like say what can I have another technology where I can have you say</v>

2666
01:15:07.341 --> 01:15:11.090
<v Speaker 2>a few words and then have a mimic voice that sounds exactly like you.</v>

2667
01:15:11.450 --> 01:15:11.871
<v Speaker 2>So then I,</v>

2668
01:15:11.871 --> 01:15:13.150
<v Speaker 2>in the future I can have a,</v>

2669
01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:18.080
<v Speaker 2>you look like you are saying something and be completely just a program or two</v>

2670
01:15:18.110 --> 01:15:20.480
<v Speaker 2>that are working on your voice and your face.</v>

2671
01:15:20.540 --> 01:15:20.721
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2672
01:15:20.721 --> 01:15:21.370
<v Speaker 2>what they've done it</v>

2673
01:15:21.370 --> 01:15:26.230
<v Speaker 4>past is they've spliced together little snippets of stuff to make it seem like</v>

2674
01:15:26.231 --> 01:15:29.200
<v Speaker 4>someone was saying something like they did that with Ronald Reagan,</v>

2675
01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:32.470
<v Speaker 4>Ronald Reagan during his administration.</v>

2676
01:15:32.530 --> 01:15:33.040
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

2677
01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:35.790
<v Speaker 4>he gave some speech and uh,</v>

2678
01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:36.850
<v Speaker 4>somebody,</v>

2679
01:15:36.850 --> 01:15:38.050
<v Speaker 4>some bad people.</v>

2680
01:15:38.051 --> 01:15:38.890
<v Speaker 4>So we're in the world.</v>

2681
01:15:39.460 --> 01:15:43.880
<v Speaker 4>They took his speech and they chopped it up and made it some other broadcast.</v>

2682
01:15:43.881 --> 01:15:46.000
<v Speaker 4>Then broadcast it to people all around the world saying,</v>

2683
01:15:46.001 --> 01:15:48.010
<v Speaker 4>this is how evil Ronald Reagan is.</v>

2684
01:15:48.310 --> 01:15:50.110
<v Speaker 4>But then they showed it on television.</v>

2685
01:15:50.170 --> 01:15:53.050
<v Speaker 4>I remember they showed all the different pieces.</v>

2686
01:15:53.250 --> 01:15:56.200
<v Speaker 4>I think of that target reenacted.</v>

2687
01:15:56.530 --> 01:15:57.700
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty close.</v>

2688
01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:00.071
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

2689
01:16:00.071 --> 01:16:00.904
<v Speaker 4>It's so weird.</v>

2690
01:16:01.060 --> 01:16:05.500
<v Speaker 4>We're looking at a source actor who's on the left and then we're looking at a</v>

2691
01:16:05.501 --> 01:16:07.240
<v Speaker 4>guy on the right who's the,</v>

2692
01:16:07.241 --> 01:16:08.074
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2693
01:16:08.170 --> 01:16:09.330
<v Speaker 4>the CGI.</v>

2694
01:16:10.150 --> 01:16:10.720
<v Speaker 4>Like there's this,</v>

2695
01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:13.000
<v Speaker 4>there's a guy who is the,</v>

2696
01:16:13.001 --> 01:16:13.091
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2697
01:16:13.091 --> 01:16:15.730
<v Speaker 4>the guy has got no expression whatsoever.</v>

2698
01:16:15.970 --> 01:16:17.800
<v Speaker 4>And then there's a guy who's manipulating him,</v>

2699
01:16:17.801 --> 01:16:19.600
<v Speaker 4>who sits above him in the frame.</v>

2700
01:16:19.900 --> 01:16:22.750
<v Speaker 4>And as he makes these expressions in the frame,</v>

2701
01:16:22.751 --> 01:16:23.950
<v Speaker 4>the guy on the left,</v>

2702
01:16:23.980 --> 01:16:25.090
<v Speaker 4>like that guy in the left,</v>

2703
01:16:25.180 --> 01:16:25.531
<v Speaker 4>his,</v>

2704
01:16:25.531 --> 01:16:25.930
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2705
01:16:25.930 --> 01:16:26.290
<v Speaker 4>his,</v>

2706
01:16:26.290 --> 01:16:28.210
<v Speaker 4>his face,</v>

2707
01:16:28.420 --> 01:16:29.800
<v Speaker 4>even though he's not moving at all,</v>

2708
01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:34.920
<v Speaker 4>his face in the image is doing the exact same things that the other guy is.</v>

2709
01:16:35.081 --> 01:16:36.670
<v Speaker 4>And what's interesting is like,</v>

2710
01:16:36.700 --> 01:16:40.680
<v Speaker 4>it's sort of seems to be accounting for the size and shape of your face too.</v>

2711
01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:43.620
<v Speaker 4>Like the size of his lips.</v>

2712
01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:45.990
<v Speaker 4>Like you see like the one guy as the bigger lips,</v>

2713
01:16:46.230 --> 01:16:47.480
<v Speaker 4>the guy above him look at,</v>

2714
01:16:47.500 --> 01:16:50.430
<v Speaker 4>he's got them big Ole Angelina Jolie Lips.</v>

2715
01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:52.350
<v Speaker 4>But to do it in the bottom you've got some paper,</v>

2716
01:16:52.351 --> 01:16:52.680
<v Speaker 4>lips,</v>

2717
01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:53.580
<v Speaker 4>white people lips,</v>

2718
01:16:54.180 --> 01:16:56.300
<v Speaker 4>but the paper lips or what's moving.</v>

2719
01:16:56.320 --> 01:16:57.153
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>

2720
01:16:57.270 --> 01:16:57.901
<v Speaker 4>it's interesting,</v>

2721
01:16:57.901 --> 01:16:58.734
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2722
01:16:59.820 --> 01:17:01.500
<v Speaker 4>Like it's not that guys lips,</v>

2723
01:17:02.250 --> 01:17:04.260
<v Speaker 4>it's the guy below him is the,</v>

2724
01:17:04.261 --> 01:17:04.770
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2725
01:17:04.770 --> 01:17:05.880
<v Speaker 4>the guy who is not moving at all.</v>

2726
01:17:05.881 --> 01:17:10.820
<v Speaker 4>They're actually using his facial features and like the of his facial features.</v>

2727
01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:12.200
<v Speaker 4>It's really weird.</v>

2728
01:17:13.270 --> 01:17:13.430
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2729
01:17:13.430 --> 01:17:15.440
<v Speaker 4>You're not gonna be able to trust shit in the future.</v>

2730
01:17:15.530 --> 01:17:16.190
<v Speaker 4>Definitely not.</v>

2731
01:17:16.190 --> 01:17:16.760
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2732
01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:17.001
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2733
01:17:17.001 --> 01:17:18.320
<v Speaker 4>it's probably already happened.</v>

2734
01:17:18.350 --> 01:17:20.220
<v Speaker 4>We just don't know me.</v>

2735
01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:22.250
<v Speaker 4>If we're watching this on youtube,</v>

2736
01:17:22.370 --> 01:17:23.870
<v Speaker 4>what does the CIA have right now?</v>

2737
01:17:23.890 --> 01:17:24.190
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2738
01:17:24.190 --> 01:17:24.860
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2739
01:17:24.860 --> 01:17:25.041
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2740
01:17:25.041 --> 01:17:25.310
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

2741
01:17:25.310 --> 01:17:26.570
<v Speaker 4>they must have some insane shit.</v>

2742
01:17:27.410 --> 01:17:27.891
<v Speaker 4>By the way,</v>

2743
01:17:27.891 --> 01:17:28.880
<v Speaker 4>speaking of the CIA,</v>

2744
01:17:29.250 --> 01:17:29.720
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2745
01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:34.720
<v Speaker 4>Neil degrasse Tyson talked to Edward Snowden for a two episodes of is a star</v>

2746
01:17:34.941 --> 01:17:35.930
<v Speaker 4>talk podcast.</v>

2747
01:17:36.170 --> 01:17:37.250
<v Speaker 4>It's a must listen,</v>

2748
01:17:37.460 --> 01:17:38.450
<v Speaker 4>so I'm must listen.</v>

2749
01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:39.313
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing.</v>

2750
01:17:39.440 --> 01:17:42.950
<v Speaker 4>Fresnel Snowden's a lot fucking smarter than I thought it was because I remember</v>

2751
01:17:42.951 --> 01:17:44.360
<v Speaker 4>I'm thinking like,</v>

2752
01:17:44.390 --> 01:17:45.120
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

2753
01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:45.980
<v Speaker 4>like this guy,</v>

2754
01:17:46.100 --> 01:17:50.150
<v Speaker 4>like he was a high school dropout and all of a sudden he's working for the NSA</v>

2755
01:17:50.151 --> 01:17:50.990
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

2756
01:17:50.991 --> 01:17:52.250
<v Speaker 4>or the CIA or whatever.</v>

2757
01:17:52.251 --> 01:17:54.500
<v Speaker 4>He was working for gathering data.</v>

2758
01:17:54.501 --> 01:17:55.940
<v Speaker 4>Like why don't they let a high school drama?</v>

2759
01:17:56.210 --> 01:17:56.780
<v Speaker 4>But then you,</v>

2760
01:17:56.780 --> 01:18:00.560
<v Speaker 4>you hear a story and you realize what he actually did wind up going to college</v>

2761
01:18:00.561 --> 01:18:02.600
<v Speaker 4>and did wind up going to school and just,</v>

2762
01:18:02.630 --> 01:18:04.700
<v Speaker 4>he would just had to kind of a tumultuous slide.</v>

2763
01:18:04.701 --> 01:18:07.400
<v Speaker 4>But he was working for the NSA when he was like 16.</v>

2764
01:18:07.820 --> 01:18:09.170
<v Speaker 4>Like he's a super genius.</v>

2765
01:18:09.370 --> 01:18:09.831
<v Speaker 4>I'm just his,</v>

2766
01:18:09.831 --> 01:18:11.870
<v Speaker 4>he didn't graduate from high school.</v>

2767
01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:13.130
<v Speaker 4>When you listen to him talk,</v>

2768
01:18:13.131 --> 01:18:18.131
<v Speaker 4>he's very fucking smart and he's very well read and understands exactly what the</v>

2769
01:18:19.581 --> 01:18:22.970
<v Speaker 4>problems with all of this technology and this,</v>

2770
01:18:22.971 --> 01:18:23.660
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2771
01:18:23.660 --> 01:18:24.920
<v Speaker 4>uncheck surveillance.</v>

2772
01:18:25.130 --> 01:18:25.281
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2773
01:18:25.281 --> 01:18:26.114
<v Speaker 4>he's a hero.</v>

2774
01:18:26.210 --> 01:18:26.411
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2775
01:18:26.411 --> 01:18:27.000
<v Speaker 4>that I,</v>

2776
01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:27.560
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

2777
01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:28.070
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2778
01:18:28.070 --> 01:18:30.890
<v Speaker 4>I know some people have differing opinions on him,</v>

2779
01:18:31.310 --> 01:18:31.581
<v Speaker 4>but he,</v>

2780
01:18:31.581 --> 01:18:36.581
<v Speaker 4>that guy enlightened us to the activities of the government that what they were</v>

2781
01:18:37.161 --> 01:18:38.360
<v Speaker 4>doing something that was illegal.</v>

2782
01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:41.720
<v Speaker 4>They were doing something that 99% of people are going to have a real problem</v>

2783
01:18:41.721 --> 01:18:44.720
<v Speaker 4>with spying on people that haven't done anything wrong,</v>

2784
01:18:45.740 --> 01:18:47.690
<v Speaker 4>and it's a,</v>

2785
01:18:47.700 --> 01:18:49.640
<v Speaker 4>it's fascinating to listen to him talk.</v>

2786
01:18:50.390 --> 01:18:53.120
<v Speaker 4>He also had some really interesting shit to say about aliens,</v>

2787
01:18:53.900 --> 01:18:55.160
<v Speaker 4>which I thought was really crazy.</v>

2788
01:18:55.580 --> 01:18:58.760
<v Speaker 4>He was like in a really complex,</v>

2789
01:18:59.060 --> 01:19:00.740
<v Speaker 4>super advanced society.</v>

2790
01:19:00.980 --> 01:19:02.600
<v Speaker 4>They're going to have compressed data,</v>

2791
01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:06.740
<v Speaker 4>like everything's going to be compressed and everything's going to be encrypted,</v>

2792
01:19:07.220 --> 01:19:09.380
<v Speaker 4>and when you have compressed and encrypted data,</v>

2793
01:19:09.381 --> 01:19:11.750
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be indistinguishable from background noise.</v>

2794
01:19:12.250 --> 01:19:13.790
<v Speaker 4>It's like you're not going to know what you're listening to.</v>

2795
01:19:14.210 --> 01:19:18.710
<v Speaker 4>So if you're listening to like some super advanced aliens communications and</v>

2796
01:19:18.711 --> 01:19:19.970
<v Speaker 4>you're catching them through the air,</v>

2797
01:19:20.660 --> 01:19:22.550
<v Speaker 4>good luck trying to figure out what that is like.</v>

2798
01:19:22.550 --> 01:19:26.900
<v Speaker 4>They're not broadcasting like unless they're trying to reach us using our own</v>

2799
01:19:26.901 --> 01:19:27.860
<v Speaker 4>primitive methods.</v>

2800
01:19:28.070 --> 01:19:29.870
<v Speaker 4>They're not broadcasting like that anymore.</v>

2801
01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:30.680
<v Speaker 4>Like they're,</v>

2802
01:19:30.680 --> 01:19:33.380
<v Speaker 4>if they're advanced enough so they can get here from another planet,</v>

2803
01:19:33.650 --> 01:19:37.250
<v Speaker 4>most likely they're encrypting everything and everything is,</v>

2804
01:19:37.370 --> 01:19:38.150
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2805
01:19:38.150 --> 01:19:38.920
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of we're,</v>

2806
01:19:38.920 --> 01:19:39.800
<v Speaker 4>we're going to hear it.</v>

2807
01:19:40.010 --> 01:19:41.450
<v Speaker 4>It's going to sound like background noise.</v>

2808
01:19:41.451 --> 01:19:42.830
<v Speaker 4>We're not going to know what the fuck it is,</v>

2809
01:19:43.250 --> 01:19:44.840
<v Speaker 4>but to them it's going to be,</v>

2810
01:19:44.900 --> 01:19:45.201
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2811
01:19:45.201 --> 01:19:49.280
<v Speaker 4>it's going to go into their super advanced systems and it will be clear as day</v>

2812
01:19:49.730 --> 01:19:53.990
<v Speaker 4>what to us it's like trying to send an internet signal to someone who was on the</v>

2813
01:19:53.991 --> 01:19:56.540
<v Speaker 4>Santa Maria back in the Columbus days.</v>

2814
01:19:56.541 --> 01:19:56.871
<v Speaker 4>They'd be like,</v>

2815
01:19:56.871 --> 01:19:57.770
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck you doing?</v>

2816
01:19:57.860 --> 01:19:58.820
<v Speaker 4>I sent you the email,</v>

2817
01:19:59.930 --> 01:20:01.160
<v Speaker 4>you sent me the email.</v>

2818
01:20:01.190 --> 01:20:02.240
<v Speaker 4>I'm on a boat here.</v>

2819
01:20:02.241 --> 01:20:03.230
<v Speaker 4>I'm getting scurvy.</v>

2820
01:20:03.350 --> 01:20:03.781
<v Speaker 4>What do you mean?</v>

2821
01:20:03.781 --> 01:20:04.041
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>

2822
01:20:04.041 --> 01:20:05.060
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck's in email?</v>

2823
01:20:05.061 --> 01:20:05.894
<v Speaker 4>What are you talking about?</v>

2824
01:20:05.930 --> 01:20:06.131
<v Speaker 4>Dude?</v>

2825
01:20:06.131 --> 01:20:06.770
<v Speaker 4>Check your phone.</v>

2826
01:20:06.770 --> 01:20:07.603
<v Speaker 4>Check my what?</v>

2827
01:20:07.860 --> 01:20:08.040
<v Speaker 4>Like</v>

2828
01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:09.390
<v Speaker 1>they won't even know what you're talking about.</v>

2829
01:20:09.391 --> 01:20:09.960
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2830
01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:11.670
<v Speaker 1>Well you think about what that is.</v>

2831
01:20:11.671 --> 01:20:12.120
<v Speaker 1>Think of that,</v>

2832
01:20:12.120 --> 01:20:16.260
<v Speaker 1>that sort of electronic communication that just a few hundred years ago is</v>

2833
01:20:16.261 --> 01:20:20.370
<v Speaker 1>completely alien and out of the question to the point where they would not be</v>

2834
01:20:20.371 --> 01:20:23.160
<v Speaker 1>able to even conceptualize what you're saying.</v>

2835
01:20:23.370 --> 01:20:25.260
<v Speaker 1>Have you tried to explain something to them?</v>

2836
01:20:25.470 --> 01:20:28.860
<v Speaker 1>My friend keeps sending me these Dick pics a phone.</v>

2837
01:20:29.010 --> 01:20:29.401
<v Speaker 1>He'd be like,</v>

2838
01:20:29.401 --> 01:20:31.140
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are you talking about?</v>

2839
01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:36.320
<v Speaker 1>Now think of that and now extrapolate to a society that's a thousand years more</v>

2840
01:20:37.111 --> 01:20:39.780
<v Speaker 1>advanced than us or a million years more advanced than us.</v>

2841
01:20:40.170 --> 01:20:45.170
<v Speaker 1>And it's the same sort of lack of ability to recognize what they're doing unless</v>

2842
01:20:46.530 --> 01:20:50.310
<v Speaker 1>the technology and the science was so good,</v>

2843
01:20:50.311 --> 01:20:53.400
<v Speaker 1>how it should be that there was like a downgrade a bubble.</v>

2844
01:20:53.490 --> 01:20:55.410
<v Speaker 1>Like it detects our language and goes,</v>

2845
01:20:55.411 --> 01:20:55.801
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2846
01:20:55.801 --> 01:21:00.801
<v Speaker 1>this is English around the year 2015 I will now convert it to a understandable,</v>

2847
01:21:01.230 --> 01:21:01.561
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2848
01:21:01.561 --> 01:21:04.830
<v Speaker 1>communication like well that's if they were trying to communicate with us.</v>

2849
01:21:04.830 --> 01:21:05.641
<v Speaker 1>That's what I said earlier.</v>

2850
01:21:05.641 --> 01:21:08.820
<v Speaker 1>If they chose to send something non encrypted,</v>

2851
01:21:09.090 --> 01:21:11.550
<v Speaker 1>but the problem is they're going to be communicating with each other.</v>

2852
01:21:11.910 --> 01:21:14.100
<v Speaker 1>It's like if we chose to talk to someone,</v>

2853
01:21:14.130 --> 01:21:14.700
<v Speaker 1>if we could,</v>

2854
01:21:14.700 --> 01:21:17.400
<v Speaker 1>we had a time machine and we can go back to Columbus.</v>

2855
01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:19.590
<v Speaker 1>We would get him a scroll,</v>

2856
01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:20.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2857
01:21:20.370 --> 01:21:21.750
<v Speaker 1>and it would have some writing on it.</v>

2858
01:21:21.751 --> 01:21:22.371
<v Speaker 1>We could do that.</v>

2859
01:21:22.371 --> 01:21:25.140
<v Speaker 1>It'd be easy as fuck if we actually wanted to communicate with them.</v>

2860
01:21:25.530 --> 01:21:30.300
<v Speaker 1>But if Columbus was out there in the middle of the fucking ocean and he didn't</v>

2861
01:21:30.301 --> 01:21:33.990
<v Speaker 1>know he had five bars on his phone and he didn't know his awesome Wifi.</v>

2862
01:21:34.270 --> 01:21:35.550
<v Speaker 1>W He has no idea.</v>

2863
01:21:35.820 --> 01:21:36.720
<v Speaker 1>He's just out there.</v>

2864
01:21:36.810 --> 01:21:37.830
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing out here.</v>

2865
01:21:38.070 --> 01:21:38.581
<v Speaker 1>What do I do?</v>

2866
01:21:38.581 --> 01:21:39.241
<v Speaker 1>I'm on my own.</v>

2867
01:21:39.241 --> 01:21:40.080
<v Speaker 1>You're not on your own pitch.</v>

2868
01:21:40.081 --> 01:21:40.890
<v Speaker 1>Plot your phone.</v>

2869
01:21:40.890 --> 01:21:41.850
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't have a phone.</v>

2870
01:21:41.970 --> 01:21:43.920
<v Speaker 1>So like the,</v>

2871
01:21:44.340 --> 01:21:49.340
<v Speaker 1>the ability to do something in the future might be completely outside of our,</v>

2872
01:21:49.850 --> 01:21:54.360
<v Speaker 1>our imagination right now are completely outside of our comprehension front page</v>

2873
01:21:54.361 --> 01:21:55.530
<v Speaker 1>of CNN right now.</v>

01:25:39.470 --> 01:25:40.303
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3000
01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:42.500
<v Speaker 2>that's judging last comic standing.</v>

3001
01:25:43.480 --> 01:25:43.671
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3002
01:25:43.671 --> 01:25:45.800
<v Speaker 2>you can't judge the winner of a debate,</v>

3003
01:25:46.220 --> 01:25:46.551
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3004
01:25:46.551 --> 01:25:49.010
<v Speaker 2>It's just always going to be someone unless they're,</v>

3005
01:25:49.130 --> 01:25:50.000
<v Speaker 2>one of them's like,</v>

3006
01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:50.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3007
01:25:50.750 --> 01:25:53.810
<v Speaker 2>Dan Quayle or someone totally incompetent sh.</v>

3008
01:25:53.870 --> 01:25:55.670
<v Speaker 2>So find out that CNN,</v>

3009
01:25:55.760 --> 01:25:56.120
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3010
01:25:56.120 --> 01:25:57.110
<v Speaker 2>owned by Time Warner,</v>

3011
01:25:57.170 --> 01:26:01.460
<v Speaker 2>Time Warner is the seventh largest campaign tribute or to Hillary Clinton,</v>

3012
01:26:01.461 --> 01:26:02.271
<v Speaker 2>like over,</v>

3013
01:26:02.271 --> 01:26:05.420
<v Speaker 2>I think it was hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars</v>

3014
01:26:05.420 --> 01:26:08.930
<v Speaker 1>Time Warner as donated to Hillary course course.</v>

3015
01:26:08.990 --> 01:26:10.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there's an agenda.</v>

3016
01:26:10.460 --> 01:26:11.001
<v Speaker 1>I mean we're,</v>

3017
01:26:11.001 --> 01:26:12.290
<v Speaker 1>we're like laughing.</v>

3018
01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:12.801
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3019
01:26:12.801 --> 01:26:13.634
<v Speaker 1>those thieves,</v>

3020
01:26:13.670 --> 01:26:14.900
<v Speaker 1>they robbed somebody.</v>

3021
01:26:15.050 --> 01:26:16.610
<v Speaker 1>What's hot?</v>

3022
01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:18.020
<v Speaker 1>Did they really rob somebody?</v>

3023
01:26:18.050 --> 01:26:18.890
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

3024
01:26:18.950 --> 01:26:23.950
<v Speaker 1>The thieves rob people like were like surprised that some greasy politician had</v>

3025
01:26:24.461 --> 01:26:27.290
<v Speaker 1>her greasy hands and some of the greasy company.</v>

3026
01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:27.860
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

3027
01:26:27.860 --> 01:26:28.491
<v Speaker 1>Look what they did.</v>

3028
01:26:28.491 --> 01:26:32.180
<v Speaker 1>The Ron Paul and then when Ron Paul was doing those debates and smashing people</v>

3029
01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:33.020
<v Speaker 1>and they may,</v>

3030
01:26:33.020 --> 01:26:33.410
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

3031
01:26:33.410 --> 01:26:38.150
<v Speaker 1>he was ahead of people in the race and they would look at the people below him</v>

3032
01:26:38.180 --> 01:26:39.290
<v Speaker 1>as qualified,</v>

3033
01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:41.720
<v Speaker 1>sincere candidates and they would look at Ron Paul.</v>

3034
01:26:41.721 --> 01:26:41.901
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3035
01:26:41.901 --> 01:26:44.990
<v Speaker 1>it's just a matter of time before Ron Paul's out of the race.</v>

3036
01:26:45.140 --> 01:26:45.591
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

3037
01:26:45.591 --> 01:26:46.550
<v Speaker 1>that's not what he's supposed to do.</v>

3038
01:26:46.551 --> 01:26:47.420
<v Speaker 1>When you're a journalist,</v>

3039
01:26:47.510 --> 01:26:48.470
<v Speaker 1>when you're a journalist,</v>

3040
01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:52.280
<v Speaker 1>you're supposed to look at the actual event and look at the actual facts of the</v>

3041
01:26:52.281 --> 01:26:54.020
<v Speaker 1>event and then break down.</v>

3042
01:26:54.020 --> 01:26:55.610
<v Speaker 1>What's interesting about the trend,</v>

3043
01:26:56.060 --> 01:26:56.900
<v Speaker 1>but they didn't do that.</v>

3044
01:26:56.901 --> 01:27:00.830
<v Speaker 1>They put a spin on the trend and it's a spin was clearly that Ron Paul was a</v>

3045
01:27:00.831 --> 01:27:02.570
<v Speaker 1>kook and that this wasn't going to last.</v>

3046
01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:06.320
<v Speaker 1>Even though you've got people wearing Ron Paul for president shirts and cheering</v>

3047
01:27:06.321 --> 01:27:07.000
<v Speaker 1>and screaming.</v>

3048
01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:08.490
<v Speaker 1>W how do your,</v>

3049
01:27:08.590 --> 01:27:12.650
<v Speaker 1>so you are smarter than them to the point where you're going to dictate how the</v>

3050
01:27:12.651 --> 01:27:13.260
<v Speaker 1>information,</v>

3051
01:27:13.260 --> 01:27:16.910
<v Speaker 1>the news is getting to these people with a biased spin that makes that guy look</v>

3052
01:27:16.911 --> 01:27:17.744
<v Speaker 1>like a Kook.</v>

3053
01:27:17.790 --> 01:27:19.120
<v Speaker 1>Like that's a Fox News did.</v>

3054
01:27:19.121 --> 01:27:20.240
<v Speaker 1>That's what a lot of people did.</v>

3055
01:27:20.540 --> 01:27:22.070
<v Speaker 1>That's what they're going to do to Bernie Sanders.</v>

3056
01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:23.720
<v Speaker 1>They're scared of that guy.</v>

3057
01:27:23.990 --> 01:27:24.261
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3058
01:27:24.261 --> 01:27:25.760

<v Speaker 1>Good Lord.</v>

3083
01:28:04.410 --> 01:28:05.880

3084
01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:08.160
<v Speaker 1>Why would they delete that?</v>

3085
01:28:09.630 --> 01:28:10.840
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

3086
01:28:10.890 --> 01:28:11.880

<v Speaker 1>you know what that is?</v>

3093
01:28:22.801 --> 01:28:24.690
<v Speaker 1>That's the online trolls.</v>

3094
01:28:25.080 --> 01:28:28.320
<v Speaker 1>When people don't go along with your opinion,</v>

3095
01:28:28.350 --> 01:28:29.010
<v Speaker 1>they're trolls.</v>

3096
01:28:29.010 --> 01:28:29.550
<v Speaker 1>O'Malley,</v>

3097
01:28:29.550 --> 01:28:30.060
<v Speaker 1>you're out.</v>

3098
01:28:30.060 --> 01:28:31.200
<v Speaker 1>We can't have red people.</v>

3099
01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:31.951
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3100
01:28:31.951 --> 01:28:33.300
<v Speaker 1>we can have native Americans,</v>

3101
01:28:33.301 --> 01:28:34.650
<v Speaker 1>but you can't be totally red.</v>

3102
01:28:35.130 --> 01:28:35.911
<v Speaker 1>That's a boozer.</v>

3103
01:28:35.911 --> 01:28:38.940
<v Speaker 1>He's either boozing or he fell asleep while he's drunk and he got a sunburn.</v>

3104
01:28:39.390 --> 01:28:40.223
<v Speaker 1>Look at that guy.</v>

3105
01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:42.330
<v Speaker 1>He's an Irish guy with a big red face.</v>

3106
01:28:43.260 --> 01:28:44.190
<v Speaker 1>That's ridiculous.</v>

3107
01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:45.750
<v Speaker 1>You can't be in there.</v>

3108
01:28:45.750 --> 01:28:46.740
<v Speaker 1>How did he get anything?</v>

3109
01:28:46.770 --> 01:28:47.760
<v Speaker 1>I never heard of that guy.</v>

3110
01:28:49.360 --> 01:28:50.670
<v Speaker 1>If I haven't heard of you by now.</v>

3111
01:28:50.700 --> 01:28:51.533
<v Speaker 1>It's over.</v>

3112
01:28:51.910 --> 01:28:52.743
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3113
01:28:52.980 --> 01:28:53.813
<v Speaker 1>throwing the towel.</v>

3114
01:28:54.480 --> 01:28:57.240
<v Speaker 1>This is the black guy who doesn't believe in evolution.</v>

3115
01:28:57.660 --> 01:29:02.040
<v Speaker 1>There's the Hillary who's got the bad email account and there's Bernie Sanders</v>

3116
01:29:02.230 --> 01:29:03.450
<v Speaker 4>wants to give away everybody's money.</v>

3117
01:29:04.500 --> 01:29:09.500
<v Speaker 4>But apparently economists looked at Bernie Sanders plans for reducing deficit</v>

3118
01:29:09.911 --> 01:29:10.651
<v Speaker 4>and like,</v>

3119
01:29:10.651 --> 01:29:13.660
<v Speaker 4>what if this doesn't work like I,</v>

3120
01:29:13.850 --> 01:29:15.360
<v Speaker 4>I don't think anybody looks at it and goes,</v>

3121
01:29:15.361 --> 01:29:18.360
<v Speaker 4>this is a wonderful idea that fix our problems.</v>

3122
01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:21.840
<v Speaker 4>He's a serious hardcore socialist and a lot of ways,</v>

3123
01:29:22.230 --> 01:29:23.190
<v Speaker 4>but I think that's good.</v>

3124
01:29:23.220 --> 01:29:25.320
<v Speaker 4>It's good to have a guy like that starting it up.</v>

3125
01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:26.700
<v Speaker 4>If that got got into power,</v>

3126
01:29:27.090 --> 01:29:27.923
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>

3127
01:29:28.110 --> 01:29:30.840
<v Speaker 4>it's fucking better than having another neo-con.</v>

3128
01:29:31.050 --> 01:29:36.050
<v Speaker 4>It's way better than having another Dick Cheney behind the fucking puppet stand</v>

3129
01:29:36.390 --> 01:29:39.450
<v Speaker 4>was hand up George Bushes ass that fucked us.</v>

3130
01:29:39.690 --> 01:29:41.250
<v Speaker 4>Those eight years fucked us.</v>

3131
01:29:41.280 --> 01:29:43.080
<v Speaker 4>They changed the tone of our country.</v>

3132
01:29:43.560 --> 01:29:46.690
<v Speaker 4>They went from a a time where there was this,</v>

3133
01:29:46.790 --> 01:29:49.680
<v Speaker 4>this feeling of America where everybody was sympathetic,</v>

3134
01:29:49.800 --> 01:29:52.080
<v Speaker 4>where people were making new and even Paris,</v>

3135
01:29:52.081 --> 01:29:53.100
<v Speaker 4>they're putting other newspaper.</v>

3136
01:29:53.220 --> 01:29:54.750
<v Speaker 4>We're all Americans today.</v>

3137
01:29:55.220 --> 01:29:55.351
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3138
01:29:55.351 --> 01:29:55.531
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>

3139
01:29:55.531 --> 01:30:00.531
<v Speaker 4>it was a amazing time where a horrible thing happened and the whole world came</v>

3140
01:30:00.721 --> 01:30:05.480
<v Speaker 4>to us and they came to us and they extended their,</v>

3141
01:30:05.520 --> 01:30:07.800
<v Speaker 4>their love and friendship and what do we do?</v>

3142
01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:09.360
<v Speaker 4>Which started invading pitches.</v>

3143
01:30:09.390 --> 01:30:11.490
<v Speaker 4>We invaded people that didn't have anything to do with it.</v>

3144
01:30:11.670 --> 01:30:14.280
<v Speaker 4>We fucked up to the point where eight years later,</v>

3145
01:30:14.370 --> 01:30:15.600
<v Speaker 4>everybody hated us.</v>

3146
01:30:15.810 --> 01:30:20.130
<v Speaker 4>Everybody went from loving America to why were you in Iraq?</v>

3147
01:30:20.610 --> 01:30:20.940
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

3148
01:30:20.940 --> 01:30:21.541
<v Speaker 4>what do you do?</v>

3149
01:30:21.541 --> 01:30:22.590
<v Speaker 4>There's no weapons there.</v>

3150
01:30:22.591 --> 01:30:24.090
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing that you guys are assholes.</v>

3151
01:30:24.210 --> 01:30:25.260
<v Speaker 4>What are you doing with all that oil?</v>

3152
01:30:25.290 --> 01:30:26.510
<v Speaker 4>What do you know what?</v>

3153
01:30:26.550 --> 01:30:26.701
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3154
01:30:26.701 --> 01:30:27.960
<v Speaker 4>you just rebuilding shit.</v>

3155
01:30:27.990 --> 01:30:28.441
<v Speaker 4>What are you doing?</v>

3156
01:30:28.441 --> 01:30:29.610
<v Speaker 4>You just have no wait.</v>

3157
01:30:29.910 --> 01:30:32.400
<v Speaker 4>You have no bid contracts for billions of dollars.</v>

3158
01:30:32.730 --> 01:30:33.270
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

3159
01:30:33.270 --> 01:30:33.691
<v Speaker 4>Hold on.</v>

3160
01:30:33.691 --> 01:30:34.080
<v Speaker 4>Hold on.</v>

3161
01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:38.550
<v Speaker 4>You're fucking vice president was the CEO of the company that gets the no bid</v>

3162
01:30:38.551 --> 01:30:39.151
<v Speaker 4>contracts.</v>

3163
01:30:39.151 --> 01:30:39.631
<v Speaker 4>They are you.</v>

3164
01:30:39.631 --> 01:30:41.580
<v Speaker 4>I said that fucking transparent.</v>

3165
01:30:41.940 --> 01:30:43.200
<v Speaker 4>That it's that transparent.</v>

3166
01:30:43.500 --> 01:30:44.333
<v Speaker 4>That's what happened.</v>

3167
01:30:44.400 --> 01:30:46.200
<v Speaker 4>That those people fucked us.</v>

3168
01:30:46.500 --> 01:30:48.180
<v Speaker 4>If we had Obama in office,</v>

3169
01:30:48.300 --> 01:30:49.800
<v Speaker 4>say what you want about Obama,</v>

3170
01:30:50.130 --> 01:30:52.370
<v Speaker 4>but Obama would've never,</v>

3171
01:30:52.620 --> 01:30:54.660
<v Speaker 4>it w there was no wet unless,</v>

3172
01:30:54.780 --> 01:30:58.740
<v Speaker 4>unless the president has no fucking say whatsoever on how things go down,</v>

3173
01:30:58.741 --> 01:30:59.820
<v Speaker 4>unless it's that dirty,</v>

3174
01:31:00.810 --> 01:31:03.870
<v Speaker 4>there's no way that guy would have approached it the same way.</v>

3175
01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:07.440
<v Speaker 4>There's no way he would've come up with some reason why we had to invade Iraq.</v>

3176
01:31:08.070 --> 01:31:08.581
<v Speaker 4>I say that,</v>

3177
01:31:08.581 --> 01:31:11.160
<v Speaker 4>but he did want us to invade Syria and people were like,</v>

3178
01:31:11.161 --> 01:31:11.994
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

3179
01:31:12.300 --> 01:31:13.170
<v Speaker 4>I remember that.</v>

3180
01:31:13.950 --> 01:31:14.910
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't come up anymore.</v>

3181
01:31:14.911 --> 01:31:15.744
<v Speaker 4>Does it,</v>

3182
01:31:16.650 --> 01:31:17.520
<v Speaker 2>do you think should end it.</v>

3183
01:31:17.550 --> 01:31:21.990
<v Speaker 2>Do you think news should be put under stricter guidelines for,</v>

3184
01:31:22.020 --> 01:31:22.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3185
01:31:22.740 --> 01:31:23.090
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3186
01:31:23.090 --> 01:31:23.551
<v Speaker 2>like that?</v>

3187
01:31:23.551 --> 01:31:24.450
<v Speaker 2>Should it be illegal?</v>

3188
01:31:24.480 --> 01:31:24.691
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3189
01:31:24.691 --> 01:31:26.100
<v Speaker 2>CNN picking aside,</v>

3190
01:31:26.160 --> 01:31:30.090
<v Speaker 2>giving money to a president and then announcing it or look at the former Fox guy</v>

3191
01:31:30.091 --> 01:31:31.800
<v Speaker 2>that just got arrested for sending,</v>

3192
01:31:31.810 --> 01:31:32.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3193
01:31:32.010 --> 01:31:32.843
<v Speaker 2>fabricating a,</v>

3194
01:31:32.910 --> 01:31:36.450
<v Speaker 2>a fake CIA past or Bryan Adams who you know,</v>

3195
01:31:36.750 --> 01:31:37.300
<v Speaker 2>Brian Williams,</v>

3196
01:31:37.300 --> 01:31:38.133
<v Speaker 2>Brian Williams,</v>

3197
01:31:38.280 --> 01:31:39.113
<v Speaker 4>Bryan Adams.</v>

3198
01:31:42.950 --> 01:31:45.520
<v Speaker 2>He's released a CD that covered the whole Taylor swift album.</v>

3199
01:31:45.521 --> 01:31:50.270
<v Speaker 2>I highly recommended he re reimagine Taylor Swiss whole album.</v>

3200
01:31:50.390 --> 01:31:51.223
<v Speaker 2>Oh boy.</v>

3201
01:31:51.440 --> 01:31:53.390
<v Speaker 2>That's been a real dark,</v>

3202
01:31:53.530 --> 01:31:53.940
<v Speaker 2>dark.</v>

3203
01:31:53.940 --> 01:31:54.920
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't sound like Taylor swift.</v>

3204
01:31:55.250 --> 01:31:55.881
<v Speaker 2>Is it like,</v>

3205
01:31:55.881 --> 01:31:56.210
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3206
01:31:56.210 --> 01:31:58.910
<v Speaker 2>like when Garth Brooks had his alter ego,</v>

3207
01:31:59.490 --> 01:32:00.130
<v Speaker 2>it's</v>

3208
01:32:00.130 --> 01:32:04.660
<v Speaker 1>kind of like Willie Nelson covering a nine inch nails.</v>

3209
01:32:05.140 --> 01:32:05.973
<v Speaker 1>Know,</v>

3210
01:32:07.040 --> 01:32:08.500
<v Speaker 1>eat Johnny Cash.</v>

3211
01:32:08.530 --> 01:32:09.281
<v Speaker 1>Not Willie Nelson.</v>

3212
01:32:09.281 --> 01:32:10.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3213
01:32:10.030 --> 01:32:10.930
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

3214
01:32:12.730 --> 01:32:17.730
<v Speaker 1>Eddie Murphy told the Bill Cosby joke is that he got an award for the Mark Twain</v>

3215
01:32:17.770 --> 01:32:20.920
<v Speaker 1>Comedy Award that's going to be on PBS and he actually did like a whole bit</v>

3216
01:32:21.300 --> 01:32:22.600
<v Speaker 1>cities right in comedy again.</v>

3217
01:32:23.030 --> 01:32:23.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3218
01:32:23.360 --> 01:32:25.990
<v Speaker 1>TMC had him on yesterday saying he was gonna he should,</v>

3219
01:32:26.590 --> 01:32:28.360
<v Speaker 1>he should just go full Jim Norton.</v>

3220
01:32:28.570 --> 01:32:28.811
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

3221
01:32:28.811 --> 01:32:29.710
<v Speaker 1>I like trainees.</v>

3222
01:32:30.420 --> 01:32:33.010
<v Speaker 1>This is what you should just do and come back to the fold.</v>

3223
01:32:33.011 --> 01:32:34.180
<v Speaker 1>Just tell us who you are,</v>

3224
01:32:34.210 --> 01:32:34.871
<v Speaker 1>who you got.</v>

3225
01:32:34.871 --> 01:32:35.150
<v Speaker 1>You can't.</v>

3226
01:32:35.150 --> 01:32:36.040
<v Speaker 1>Your Dick sucked by dudes,</v>

3227
01:32:36.041 --> 01:32:37.060
<v Speaker 1>but you're really straight.</v>

3228
01:32:37.300 --> 01:32:38.133
<v Speaker 1>That's okay.</v>

3229
01:32:38.260 --> 01:32:38.921
<v Speaker 1>You're Eddie Murphy,</v>

3230
01:32:38.921 --> 01:32:39.640
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3231
01:32:39.640 --> 01:32:41.740
<v Speaker 1>She could come clean but he can't,</v>

3232
01:32:41.741 --> 01:32:42.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3233
01:32:42.130 --> 01:32:42.760
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3234
01:32:42.760 --> 01:32:43.780
<v Speaker 1>it's different man.</v>

3235
01:32:43.810 --> 01:32:44.643
<v Speaker 1>It's different.</v>

3236
01:32:45.370 --> 01:32:47.320
<v Speaker 1>Like the black community has different rules.</v>

3237
01:32:47.830 --> 01:32:48.521
<v Speaker 1>Dev deferrals,</v>

3238
01:32:48.521 --> 01:32:50.920
<v Speaker 1>which you can and can't do and some things you need to keep under wraps.</v>

3239
01:32:51.370 --> 01:32:55.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he picks those trans gender prostitutes up just because he was a</v>

3240
01:32:55.661 --> 01:32:59.080
<v Speaker 1>nice guy and he wants to give him a ride home or if he really likes them.</v>

3241
01:32:59.830 --> 01:33:04.480
<v Speaker 1>But according to my buddy who was on the force back then that he's actually been</v>

3242
01:33:04.481 --> 01:33:07.600
<v Speaker 1>there while I went down there like it wasn't,</v>

3243
01:33:07.601 --> 01:33:08.950
<v Speaker 1>those wasn't just one.</v>

3244
01:33:10.480 --> 01:33:11.200
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3245
01:33:11.200 --> 01:33:12.033
<v Speaker 1>He likes him,</v>

3246
01:33:12.580 --> 01:33:13.570
<v Speaker 1>which is fine.</v>

3247
01:33:13.630 --> 01:33:16.030
<v Speaker 1>Like Norton talks about it all the time.</v>

3248
01:33:16.031 --> 01:33:19.660
<v Speaker 1>People joke about it all the time and everybody loves Norton.</v>

3249
01:33:20.200 --> 01:33:21.130
<v Speaker 1>If you don't Love Norton,</v>

3250
01:33:21.131 --> 01:33:22.180
<v Speaker 1>go fuck yourself.</v>

3251
01:33:22.360 --> 01:33:23.193
<v Speaker 1>How about that?</v>

3252
01:33:24.030 --> 01:33:25.990
<v Speaker 1>And I think if Eddie Murphy just came clean,</v>

3253
01:33:28.100 --> 01:33:32.150
<v Speaker 1>do people turn on though all the people that voted for proposition eight that</v>

3254
01:33:32.151 --> 01:33:32.441
<v Speaker 1>was when,</v>

3255
01:33:32.441 --> 01:33:34.730
<v Speaker 1>when they found out that Ari had a great joke about that,</v>

3256
01:33:35.150 --> 01:33:37.220
<v Speaker 1>but black people want to quality.</v>

3257
01:33:37.280 --> 01:33:39.680
<v Speaker 1>Everybody was like talking about a quality except the gays like Nope,</v>

3258
01:33:39.681 --> 01:33:40.260
<v Speaker 1>not you.</v>

3259
01:33:40.260 --> 01:33:40.940
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>

3260
01:33:40.940 --> 01:33:44.180
<v Speaker 1>can't get married like black people like overwhelmingly voted.</v>

3261
01:33:44.181 --> 01:33:44.800
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

3262
01:33:44.800 --> 01:33:49.010
<v Speaker 1>the against or for proposition eight which repealed gay marriage.</v>

3263
01:33:49.490 --> 01:33:51.260
<v Speaker 1>There's like Mormons.</v>

3264
01:33:51.740 --> 01:33:55.850
<v Speaker 1>Mormons spent a lot of money on it and a lot of black people voted for religion,</v>

3265
01:33:56.360 --> 01:33:56.760
<v Speaker 1>religion,</v>

3266
01:33:56.760 --> 01:33:57.593
<v Speaker 1>strong and black.</v>

3267
01:33:57.740 --> 01:33:58.101
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3268
01:33:58.101 --> 01:33:59.600
<v Speaker 1>but it's also the gay thing.</v>

3269
01:33:59.990 --> 01:34:00.823
<v Speaker 1>It's like a,</v>

3270
01:34:00.830 --> 01:34:04.760
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain amount of homophobia that's accepted in certain parts of the</v>

3271
01:34:04.761 --> 01:34:06.260
<v Speaker 1>African American community.</v>

3272
01:34:07.610 --> 01:34:12.260
<v Speaker 1>I was a very politically correct way of saying that black folks don't like gays</v>

3273
01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:15.440
<v Speaker 1>and then it's not even all gays,</v>

3274
01:34:15.441 --> 01:34:15.890
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3275
01:34:15.890 --> 01:34:16.310
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

3276
01:34:16.310 --> 01:34:18.110
<v Speaker 1>you can't really talk about it too much.</v>

3277
01:34:18.970 --> 01:34:20.630
<v Speaker 1>But what is the bill Cosby joke he told?</v>

3278
01:34:20.900 --> 01:34:21.081
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3279
01:34:21.081 --> 01:34:21.914
<v Speaker 1>you mean play it?</v>

3280
01:34:22.430 --> 01:34:23.050
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

3281
01:34:23.050 --> 01:34:23.930
<v Speaker 1>That's all it took a minute.</v>

3282
01:34:23.960 --> 01:34:24.590
<v Speaker 1>Let's do it.</v>

3283
01:34:24.590 --> 01:34:25.130
<v Speaker 1>Play it.</v>

3284

3285
01:34:28.040 --> 01:34:29.060
<v Speaker 1>I'll just play the audio.</v>

3286
01:34:29.120 --> 01:34:29.953
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3287
01:34:32.580 --> 01:34:32.821
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3288
01:34:32.821 --> 01:34:34.980
<v Speaker 1>and if you are tuning into this now and you look good,</v>

3289
01:34:34.981 --> 01:34:35.820
<v Speaker 1>too immature Brogan,</v>

3290
01:34:35.821 --> 01:34:38.160
<v Speaker 1>would you post the wrong link on Ustream?</v>

3291
01:34:38.161 --> 01:34:38.940
<v Speaker 1>I made a mistake.</v>

3292
01:34:38.940 --> 01:34:39.750
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

3293

3295
01:34:41.940 --> 01:34:44.160

<v Speaker 1>on Youtube,</v>

3297
01:34:44.881 --> 01:34:47.440
<v Speaker 1>one of the reasons why we decided to do it on youtube is you can just rewind it</v>

3298
01:34:47.550 --> 01:34:48.383
<v Speaker 1>to the beginning.</v>

3299
01:34:48.480 --> 01:34:49.590
<v Speaker 1>Even though it's streaming.</v>

3300
01:34:49.650 --> 01:34:50.700
<v Speaker 1>You can go back to the beginning.</v>

3308
01:35:00.111 --> 01:35:02.020
<v Speaker 7>It was trying to get bill to give his trophies back.</v>

3426
01:39:11.611 --> 01:39:16.380
<v Speaker 1>want a white man in that position because of a white man is in that position.</v>

3427
01:39:16.500 --> 01:39:18.270
<v Speaker 1>Then they're supporting the patriarchy.</v>

3428
01:39:18.390 --> 01:39:20.370
<v Speaker 1>So there was three other candidates for the Gig,</v>

3429
01:39:20.400 --> 01:39:21.060
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3430
01:39:21.060 --> 01:39:22.770
<v Speaker 1>All women of color.</v>

3431
01:39:23.910 --> 01:39:24.481
<v Speaker 1>Wonderful.</v>

3432
01:39:24.481 --> 01:39:26.040
<v Speaker 1>If one of them win and then you got,</v>

3433
01:39:26.041 --> 01:39:26.311
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3434
01:39:26.311 --> 01:39:27.360
<v Speaker 1>you know what your problem solved.</v>

3435
01:39:27.390 --> 01:39:29.010
<v Speaker 1>You got a woman of color in that position.</v>

3436
01:39:29.160 --> 01:39:30.360
<v Speaker 1>Plenty of diversity there.</v>

3437
01:39:30.390 --> 01:39:30.900
<v Speaker 1>You're good,</v>

3438
01:39:30.900 --> 01:39:31.733
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3439
01:39:32.180 --> 01:39:32.550
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3440
01:39:32.550 --> 01:39:35.070
<v Speaker 1>they all dropped out and then they stayed at,</v>

3441
01:39:35.100 --> 01:39:40.100
<v Speaker 1>they started an anonymous Facebook campaign encouraging people not to vote at</v>

3442
01:39:40.381 --> 01:39:41.160
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>

3443
01:39:41.160 --> 01:39:44.190
<v Speaker 1>to keep a white man from winning the position.</v>

3444
01:39:44.460 --> 01:39:45.680
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

3445
01:39:46.140 --> 01:39:47.790
<v Speaker 1>this is amazing.</v>

3446
01:39:47.940 --> 01:39:50.190
<v Speaker 1>This is the left eating itself.</v>

3447
01:39:50.220 --> 01:39:51.090
<v Speaker 1>That's what's happening.</v>

3448
01:39:51.091 --> 01:39:52.350
<v Speaker 1>They're eating themselves.</v>

3449
01:39:52.500 --> 01:39:54.210
<v Speaker 1>It is a feeding frenzy.</v>

3450
01:39:54.420 --> 01:39:55.740
<v Speaker 1>I used to have Paranas.</v>

3451
01:39:55.800 --> 01:39:56.633
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

3452
01:39:56.970 --> 01:39:58.280
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things about [inaudible] is,</v>

3453
01:39:58.290 --> 01:39:58.501
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3454
01:39:58.501 --> 01:40:00.000
<v Speaker 1>one gets a limp.</v>

3455
01:40:00.240 --> 01:40:01.860
<v Speaker 1>They just jacked that motherfucker.</v>

3456
01:40:01.861 --> 01:40:03.480
<v Speaker 1>They are the most ruthless cunts.</v>

3457
01:40:03.750 --> 01:40:05.310
<v Speaker 1>When one Parana would just be,</v>

3458
01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:06.031
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3459
01:40:06.031 --> 01:40:07.410
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you have a fish tank,</v>

3460
01:40:07.650 --> 01:40:08.061
<v Speaker 1>one fish,</v>

3461
01:40:08.061 --> 01:40:09.270
<v Speaker 1>we'll just start swimming weird.</v>

3462
01:40:09.510 --> 01:40:11.940
<v Speaker 1>They start swimming kind of half sideways for some reason.</v>

3463
01:40:11.941 --> 01:40:12.151
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

3464
01:40:12.151 --> 01:40:13.140
<v Speaker 1>is that fish okay?</v>

3465
01:40:13.290 --> 01:40:14.280
<v Speaker 1>And you have to look at him like,</v>

3466
01:40:14.281 --> 01:40:15.300
<v Speaker 1>what's going on with that fish?</v>

3467
01:40:15.660 --> 01:40:17.670
<v Speaker 1>That shit didn't last in that tank baby.</v>

3468
01:40:17.920 --> 01:40:19.140
<v Speaker 1>All those motherfuckers are just,</v>

3469
01:40:21.390 --> 01:40:22.920
<v Speaker 1>they just started taking chunks out of them.</v>

3470
01:40:23.130 --> 01:40:24.420
<v Speaker 1>That's what's happening here.</v>

3471
01:40:24.510 --> 01:40:27.330
<v Speaker 1>The left is they're turning on themselves.</v>

3472
01:40:27.510 --> 01:40:29.070
<v Speaker 1>They've run out of outrage.</v>

3473
01:40:29.190 --> 01:40:31.050
<v Speaker 1>They've made so many safe places.</v>

3474
01:40:31.051 --> 01:40:33.570
<v Speaker 1>They don't want anything to be safe anymore and they want to be able to go to</v>

3475
01:40:33.571 --> 01:40:34.680
<v Speaker 1>war over everything.</v>

3476
01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:36.720
<v Speaker 1>They're ferocious there.</v>

3477
01:40:36.721 --> 01:40:41.721
<v Speaker 1>Paranas their social idea Paranas and they're attacking a gender.</v>

3478
01:40:42.241 --> 01:40:43.074
<v Speaker 1>Quill,</v>

3479
01:40:43.110 --> 01:40:44.160
<v Speaker 1>Gender Queer,</v>

3480
01:40:44.310 --> 01:40:49.310
<v Speaker 1>masculine of center man for not being diverse enough for being a part of the</v>

3481
01:40:50.641 --> 01:40:51.570
<v Speaker 1>patriarchy,</v>

3482
01:40:51.810 --> 01:40:53.460
<v Speaker 1>Bardo woman board.</v>

3483
01:40:53.540 --> 01:40:55.300
<v Speaker 1>A woman lived as a woman.</v>

3484
01:40:55.450 --> 01:40:55.810
<v Speaker 1>Nope,</v>

3485
01:40:55.810 --> 01:40:56.860
<v Speaker 1>you're a white man now.</v>

3486
01:40:56.861 --> 01:40:58.030
<v Speaker 1>You fucking piece of shit.</v>

3487
01:40:58.090 --> 01:40:59.320
<v Speaker 1>You're a part of the problem.</v>

3488
01:41:01.250 --> 01:41:02.120
<v Speaker 8>Makes no sense.</v>

3489
01:41:04.300 --> 01:41:05.830
<v Speaker 1>It does make sense though.</v>

3490
01:41:06.040 --> 01:41:08.950
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense because it highlights what this movement is all about.</v>

3491
01:41:08.951 --> 01:41:10.180
<v Speaker 1>It's socially retarded.</v>

3492
01:41:10.181 --> 01:41:14.410
<v Speaker 1>People that are left alone to their own devices and they're just devouring each</v>

3493
01:41:14.411 --> 01:41:15.490
<v Speaker 1>other like zombies.</v>

3494
01:41:15.640 --> 01:41:17.140
<v Speaker 1>They just tearing into each other like,</v>

3495
01:41:17.190 --> 01:41:19.480
<v Speaker 1>like zombies at a trapped into a fucking room.</v>

3496
01:41:19.481 --> 01:41:20.380
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't raw.</v>

3497
01:41:20.530 --> 01:41:22.000
<v Speaker 1>They just ripping each other apart.</v>

3498
01:41:22.270 --> 01:41:23.650
<v Speaker 1>You're not diverse enough.</v>

3499
01:41:24.100 --> 01:41:25.300
<v Speaker 1>You're not progressive enough.</v>

3500
01:41:25.301 --> 01:41:25.961
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>

3501
01:41:25.961 --> 01:41:26.651
<v Speaker 1>You're such a pig.</v>

3502
01:41:26.651 --> 01:41:27.484
<v Speaker 1>I'm triggered.</v>

3503
01:41:27.520 --> 01:41:29.380
<v Speaker 1>They just trigger each other left and right.</v>

3504
01:41:32.950 --> 01:41:33.431
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

3505
01:41:33.431 --> 01:41:33.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3506
01:41:33.610 --> 01:41:35.200
<v Speaker 1>this is an onion article.</v>

3507
01:41:35.470 --> 01:41:37.630
<v Speaker 1>This is a fucking onion article and it's not,</v>

3508
01:41:37.750 --> 01:41:39.250
<v Speaker 1>this is the national review.</v>

3509
01:41:39.400 --> 01:41:44.400
<v Speaker 1>This is a goddamn onion article and it's not transgender woman can't be</v>

3510
01:41:44.801 --> 01:41:47.860
<v Speaker 1>diversity officer because she's a white man now.</v>

3511
01:41:51.440 --> 01:41:51.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3512
01:41:51.720 --> 01:41:55.020
<v Speaker 1>Mixed 0 million cents makes all the sense in the world.</v>

3513
01:41:55.230 --> 01:41:56.460
<v Speaker 1>It's not a fake article.</v>

3514
01:41:56.461 --> 01:41:59.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean that seems like a hundred percent perfect.</v>

3515
01:41:59.160 --> 01:41:59.993
<v Speaker 1>It's perfect.</v>

3516
01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:00.900
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

3517
01:42:01.110 --> 01:42:02.010
<v Speaker 1>It's beautiful.</v>

3518
01:42:02.160 --> 01:42:05.610
<v Speaker 1>It's a rose is a rose in a bad neighborhood.</v>

3519
01:42:05.611 --> 01:42:08.460
<v Speaker 1>It pops out of the concrete and it comes out perfect.</v>

3520
01:42:08.850 --> 01:42:09.683
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

3521
01:42:09.930 --> 01:42:10.763
<v Speaker 1>This is art.</v>

3522
01:42:10.980 --> 01:42:11.381
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

3523
01:42:11.381 --> 01:42:14.010
<v Speaker 1>it's the universe creating art with our own folly.</v>

3524
01:42:14.220 --> 01:42:15.053
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>

3525
01:42:15.270 --> 01:42:16.200
<v Speaker 1>It's culture.</v>

3526
01:42:16.380 --> 01:42:17.350
<v Speaker 1>It's called [inaudible].</v>

3527
01:42:17.390 --> 01:42:18.300
<v Speaker 1>It's people,</v>

3528
01:42:18.770 --> 01:42:19.110
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

3529
01:42:19.110 --> 01:42:21.990
<v Speaker 1>There's something that happens to people when you deny reality when you don't</v>

3530
01:42:21.991 --> 01:42:24.030
<v Speaker 1>look at things objectively like there's,</v>

3531
01:42:24.060 --> 01:42:27.390
<v Speaker 1>there's I think like priest at molests kids,</v>

3532
01:42:27.570 --> 01:42:27.841
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3533
01:42:27.841 --> 01:42:30.030
<v Speaker 1>Some of that has to be from suppression.</v>

3534
01:42:30.180 --> 01:42:32.580
<v Speaker 1>Some of it has to be probably they were abused themselves.</v>

3535
01:42:32.790 --> 01:42:33.720
<v Speaker 1>There's probably all sorts of,</v>

3536
01:42:33.721 --> 01:42:38.400
<v Speaker 1>but some of that perversion has got to come from suppression.</v>

3537
01:42:38.610 --> 01:42:41.670
<v Speaker 1>It's like the Catholic school girl thing that everybody knows.</v>

3538
01:42:41.820 --> 01:42:42.091
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3539
01:42:42.091 --> 01:42:43.080
<v Speaker 1>when I was in high school,</v>

3540
01:42:43.081 --> 01:42:46.200
<v Speaker 1>there was no scientists in my fucking ninth grade class,</v>

3541
01:42:46.380 --> 01:42:50.400
<v Speaker 1>but we all knew the girls went to Catholic schools were hose and why are they</v>

3542
01:42:50.401 --> 01:42:51.750
<v Speaker 1>hose the hose?</v>

3543
01:42:51.751 --> 01:42:53.610
<v Speaker 1>Because everybody tells them they can't be a Ho.</v>

3544
01:42:53.730 --> 01:42:55.440
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's talking to them constantly about,</v>

3545
01:42:55.590 --> 01:42:57.510
<v Speaker 1>you are going to go to hell,</v>

3546
01:42:57.600 --> 01:42:59.490
<v Speaker 1>do not touch a man's genitals,</v>

3547
01:42:59.700 --> 01:43:00.630
<v Speaker 1>don't you do anything.</v>

3548
01:43:00.750 --> 01:43:02.130
<v Speaker 1>Those costs were freaks.</v>

3549
01:43:02.131 --> 01:43:04.830
<v Speaker 1>They were the biggest freaks and we all knew it.</v>

3550
01:43:05.010 --> 01:43:05.341
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>

3551
01:43:05.341 --> 01:43:05.730
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>

3552
01:43:05.730 --> 01:43:06.870
<v Speaker 1>There was no books on it.</v>

3553
01:43:07.140 --> 01:43:09.630
<v Speaker 1>There was no youtube videos that we could watch,</v>

3554
01:43:09.720 --> 01:43:10.800
<v Speaker 1>but we fucking knew it.</v>

3555
01:43:10.801 --> 01:43:11.310
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

3556
01:43:11.310 --> 01:43:16.310
<v Speaker 1>We all knew it and I think it's a suppression issue and this is suppressing</v>

3557
01:43:16.710 --> 01:43:18.120
<v Speaker 1>individual identity.</v>

3558
01:43:18.121 --> 01:43:19.800
<v Speaker 1>This is suppressing free speech.</v>

3559
01:43:20.010 --> 01:43:21.600
<v Speaker 1>This is suppressing objectivity.</v>

3560
01:43:21.720 --> 01:43:25.620
<v Speaker 1>You're not allowed to have unique or intertwined thoughts.</v>

3561
01:43:25.770 --> 01:43:28.740
<v Speaker 1>You're not allowed to share opinions with the left and with the right.</v>

3562
01:43:28.830 --> 01:43:29.820
<v Speaker 1>You're not allowed to.</v>

3563
01:43:29.940 --> 01:43:30.601
<v Speaker 1>You have to have,</v>

3564
01:43:30.601 --> 01:43:32.730
<v Speaker 1>and you're constantly worried about being called out.</v>

3565
01:43:32.940 --> 01:43:37.410
<v Speaker 1>You're constantly worried about being outed and doxed and called out and shamed.</v>

3566
01:43:37.560 --> 01:43:41.640

3584
01:44:16.730 --> 01:44:20.660
<v Speaker 1>It's like one of the greatest stories the universe has ever told cause it's,</v>

<v Speaker 1>and it,</v>

3587
01:44:21.811 --> 01:44:24.530
<v Speaker 1>it highlights that story that we were just talking about where the,</v>

<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>the thing that was up on the,</v>

3590
01:44:26.601 --> 01:44:26.751
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3591

<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3593
01:44:28.341 --> 01:44:30.140
<v Speaker 1>the United States is like a powder keg.</v>

3594
01:44:30.660 --> 01:44:32.330
<v Speaker 1>This is like what we're talking about,</v>

3595
01:44:32.331 --> 01:44:36.500
<v Speaker 1>like entitled ridiculous people that they don't live in reality.</v>

01:44:36.530 --> 01:44:36.691
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

3600
01:44:37.821 --> 01:44:39.410
<v Speaker 1>you're concentrating on nonsense.</v>

3601
01:44:39.650 --> 01:44:42.950
<v Speaker 1>But why they concentrating on nonsense because they don't have to worry about</v>

3602
01:44:42.951 --> 01:44:43.820
<v Speaker 1>feeding themselves.</v>

3603
01:44:44.030 --> 01:44:45.410
<v Speaker 1>They don't have to worry about shelter.</v>

3604
01:44:45.560 --> 01:44:50.150
<v Speaker 1>They don't have to worry about being in Ohio having no fucking power for a week</v>

3605
01:44:50.540 --> 01:44:52.190
<v Speaker 1>and everybody has to stay alive.</v>

3606
01:44:52.550 --> 01:44:53.690
<v Speaker 1>You can't get to work.</v>

3607
01:44:53.720 --> 01:44:56.390
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's like walking back and forth to each other's house,</v>

3608
01:44:56.391 --> 01:45:01.310
<v Speaker 1>Sharon food and going out and getting firewood together and dragging it back at</v>

3609
01:45:01.311 --> 01:45:02.510
<v Speaker 1>some little kids wagon.</v>

3610
01:45:02.720 --> 01:45:04.430
<v Speaker 1>That's what people do when they want to survive.</v>

3611
01:45:05.030 --> 01:45:05.430
<v Speaker 1>When,</v>

3612
01:45:05.430 --> 01:45:06.650
<v Speaker 1>when you want to survive,</v>

3613
01:45:06.890 --> 01:45:10.010
<v Speaker 1>you come up with ways that you could all work together.</v>

3614
01:45:10.220 --> 01:45:11.840
<v Speaker 1>When it's too easy to survive,</v>

3615
01:45:11.990 --> 01:45:15.530
<v Speaker 1>you start attacking people for nonsense and that's what the fuck is going on</v>

3616
01:45:15.531 --> 01:45:15.890
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

3617

3619
01:45:19.581 --> 01:45:20.390
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to win this.</v>

3620
01:45:20.390 --> 01:45:22.100
<v Speaker 1>Like as if she's really a white man.</v>

3621
01:45:22.500 --> 01:45:27.500
<v Speaker 1>Why are we pretending that's a man left of Queer Gender Queer masculine of</v>

3626
01:45:33.111 --> 01:45:34.040

3627
01:45:34.070 --> 01:45:37.850
<v Speaker 1>Who cares what the fuck it was probably way more to this story.</v>

3759
01:49:27.870 --> 01:49:30.570
<v Speaker 1>The other day that dude dancing and pulls his dick out.</v>

01:49:31.840 --> 01:49:34.110
<v Speaker 1>Will you let you send them to me so much</v>

3761
01:49:35.640 --> 01:49:38.520
<v Speaker 1>that I accuse you of sending me a guy's Dick and you're like,</v>

01:49:40.350 --> 01:49:40.501
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3764
01:49:40.501 --> 01:49:43.650
<v Speaker 1>it sometimes people will send me shit and I immediately just send it to whoever</v>

3765
01:49:43.740 --> 01:49:45.800
<v Speaker 1>is these.</v>

3766
01:49:45.840 --> 01:49:47.920
<v Speaker 1>These guys made this a</v>

3767
01:49:47.980 --> 01:49:51.670
<v Speaker 2>prank video and what they did is they took a taser and they put it in the seat</v>

3768
01:49:51.730 --> 01:49:54.880
<v Speaker 2>of a bicycle and attached it to a cell phone so he can,</v>

3769
01:49:54.910 --> 01:49:56.290
<v Speaker 2>you can call it and make,</v>

3770
01:49:56.410 --> 01:49:57.520
<v Speaker 2>activate the Taser.</v>

3771
01:49:57.820 --> 01:49:58.391
<v Speaker 2>Then they took,</v>

3772
01:49:58.391 --> 01:50:01.090
<v Speaker 2>went to Compton and just like put their bike down,</v>

3773
01:50:01.091 --> 01:50:01.421
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3774
01:50:01.421 --> 01:50:03.550
<v Speaker 2>and waited until somebody stole their bike.</v>

3775
01:50:03.880 --> 01:50:05.320
<v Speaker 2>And so then you see people like writing,</v>

3776
01:50:05.440 --> 01:50:09.100
<v Speaker 2>like taking off and then they like called the cell phone and it uh,</v>

3777
01:50:09.580 --> 01:50:10.540
<v Speaker 2>shocks their balls.</v>

3778
01:50:10.541 --> 01:50:11.860
<v Speaker 2>You know why they're sitting on the bike?</v>

3779
01:50:13.270 --> 01:50:15.190
<v Speaker 2>So they just fall off the bike.</v>

3780
01:50:16.210 --> 01:50:18.510
<v Speaker 4>That's like an advanced version of that.</v>

3781
01:50:18.511 --> 01:50:20.280
<v Speaker 4>A Bait car show?</v>

3782
01:50:20.310 --> 01:50:21.143

01:50:21.860 --> 01:50:22.410
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3785
01:50:22.410 --> 01:50:22.990
<v Speaker 4>And then they have it,</v>

3786
01:50:22.990 --> 01:50:23.350
<v Speaker 4>there</v>

3787
01:50:23.350 --> 01:50:26.080
<v Speaker 2>is this other guy that just attached a rope to it,</v>

3788
01:50:26.081 --> 01:50:27.730
<v Speaker 2>like a secret little like rope to it.</v>

3789
01:50:27.731 --> 01:50:31.780
<v Speaker 2>So people like grabbed the bike and take off down this hill and then when the</v>

3790
01:50:31.870 --> 01:50:35.960
<v Speaker 2>rope catches up it just throws the bike back and they just rack their balls.</v>

3791
01:50:36.010 --> 01:50:36.620
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3792
01:50:36.620 --> 01:50:37.310
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

3796
01:50:40.661 --> 01:50:41.500
<v Speaker 2>So who cares?</v>

3797
01:50:41.501 --> 01:50:42.320
<v Speaker 2>You know</v>

<v Speaker 4>He works all the time and he was at the store the other night killing it.</v>

3850
01:51:59.521 --> 01:52:00.630
<v Speaker 4>It's still hilarious.</v>

3851
01:52:01.170 --> 01:52:02.610
<v Speaker 4>He just doesn't put anything out.</v>

3852
01:52:02.880 --> 01:52:03.241
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

3853
01:52:03.241 --> 01:52:05.430
<v Speaker 4>he's constantly working on his podcast.</v>

3854
01:52:05.431 --> 01:52:08.670
<v Speaker 4>I think Dunkin likes doing podcasts more than anything,</v>

3855
01:52:09.060 --> 01:52:10.140
<v Speaker 4>which is fine cause it's,</v>

3856
01:52:10.290 --> 01:52:11.160
<v Speaker 4>it's amazing.</v>

3857
01:52:11.220 --> 01:52:12.180
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's a really good,</v>

3858
01:52:12.210 --> 01:52:13.110
<v Speaker 4>he's really good at it.</v>

3859
01:52:13.111 --> 01:52:16.680
<v Speaker 4>He's one of the best ranters like Dunkin.</v>

3860
01:52:16.681 --> 01:52:18.210
<v Speaker 4>Like when you do podcasts with him,</v>

3861
01:52:18.211 --> 01:52:19.021
<v Speaker 4>one of the things that happens,</v>

3862
01:52:19.021 --> 01:52:21.110
<v Speaker 4>you got to know like when to back off and just let it go.</v>

3863
01:52:21.120 --> 01:52:24.660
<v Speaker 4>Let them rant because you don't want to trip up what he's doing because he gets</v>

3864
01:52:24.661 --> 01:52:29.661
<v Speaker 4>in these like these like linguistic waves that he starts riding and he just says</v>

3865
01:52:29.971 --> 01:52:34.971
<v Speaker 4>this amazing colorful way of describing things and sometimes he'll paint a</v>

3866
01:52:35.011 --> 01:52:38.280
<v Speaker 4>picture that you wouldn't expect or you wouldn't have ever painted without it.</v>

3867
01:52:38.520 --> 01:52:38.820
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

3868
01:52:38.820 --> 01:52:39.540
<v Speaker 4>and that's,</v>

3869
01:52:39.540 --> 01:52:43.020
<v Speaker 4>that's something that you don't really do when you do stand up in a way.</v>

3870
01:52:43.050 --> 01:52:46.250
<v Speaker 4>Cause like the beauty of his style</v>

3871
01:52:46.360 --> 01:52:46.670
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

3872
01:52:46.670 --> 01:52:48.020
<v Speaker 1>of doing podcasts,</v>

3873
01:52:48.021 --> 01:52:52.130
<v Speaker 1>the entertaining aspect of it doesn't translate into anything else,</v>

3874
01:52:52.131 --> 01:52:54.140
<v Speaker 1>but it does a little bit to stand up.</v>

3875
01:52:54.290 --> 01:52:58.790
<v Speaker 1>But really it's just a beautiful style of ranting about subjects.</v>

3876
01:52:58.970 --> 01:53:00.440
<v Speaker 1>That's great for a podcast.</v>

3877
01:53:00.441 --> 01:53:03.200
<v Speaker 1>It makes it look super enjoyable and interesting.</v>

3878
01:53:03.950 --> 01:53:04.940
<v Speaker 1>But to that,</v>

3879
01:53:04.970 --> 01:53:09.970
<v Speaker 1>I think that to him is more exciting and more fun than podcasts and it's</v>

3880
01:53:10.821 --> 01:53:13.310
<v Speaker 1>certainly reaches more people or comedy me.</v>

3881
01:53:13.760 --> 01:53:13.971
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3882
01:53:13.971 --> 01:53:14.661
<v Speaker 1>Then then comedy.</v>

3883
01:53:14.661 --> 01:53:15.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3884
01:53:15.020 --> 01:53:17.960
<v Speaker 1>because it's certainly reaches more people because obviously if he's doing the</v>

3885
01:53:17.961 --> 01:53:22.670
<v Speaker 1>show and unless he's putting it out on Netflix or comedy central or something</v>

3886
01:53:22.671 --> 01:53:23.504
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>

3887
01:53:24.070 --> 01:53:27.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's doing standup for a couple hundred people at a time or a thousand</v>

3888
01:53:27.471 --> 01:53:28.304
<v Speaker 1>people at the most,</v>

3889
01:53:28.310 --> 01:53:29.143
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

3890
01:53:29.420 --> 01:53:30.680
<v Speaker 1>But if he's doing that podcast,</v>

3891
01:53:30.681 --> 01:53:33.110
<v Speaker 1>his podcast is hitting hundreds of thousands every month.</v>

3892
01:53:33.150 --> 01:53:33.340
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

3893
01:53:33.340 --> 01:53:34.960
<v Speaker 1>he's always been one of my favorite standups.</v>

3894
01:53:34.970 --> 01:53:35.803
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3895
01:53:36.110 --> 01:53:37.310
<v Speaker 1>when we first moved out here,</v>

3896
01:53:37.311 --> 01:53:40.820
<v Speaker 1>I would like goes to almost all his comedy shows with them,</v>

3897
01:53:40.850 --> 01:53:41.150
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3898
01:53:41.150 --> 01:53:43.290
<v Speaker 1>And just because I had no friends,</v>

3899
01:53:43.291 --> 01:53:44.124
<v Speaker 1>so I'd like go with him.</v>

3900
01:53:44.350 --> 01:53:44.620
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

3901
01:53:44.620 --> 01:53:47.930
<v Speaker 1>he's one of the funnest people to watch on stage,</v>

3902
01:53:47.931 --> 01:53:51.140
<v Speaker 1>especially when he had little Hobo and just like somebody stole it.</v>

3903
01:53:51.590 --> 01:53:51.861
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3904
01:53:51.861 --> 01:53:53.360
<v Speaker 1>I know it's San Francisco,</v>

3905
01:53:53.390 --> 01:53:54.370
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

3906
01:53:54.680 --> 01:53:57.590
<v Speaker 1>there's people like him I wish would do more standup.</v>

3907
01:53:57.620 --> 01:53:58.830
<v Speaker 1>Like he does Swartz in,</v>

3908
01:53:58.831 --> 01:53:59.660
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3909
01:53:59.660 --> 01:54:00.380
<v Speaker 1>I love Nick.</v>

3910
01:54:00.380 --> 01:54:01.640
<v Speaker 1>He does stand up a lot.</v>

3911
01:54:02.450 --> 01:54:04.340
<v Speaker 1>He just doesn't put anything out right.</v>

3912
01:54:04.650 --> 01:54:07.700
<v Speaker 1>And I just think he needs to put together a special,</v>

3913
01:54:07.790 --> 01:54:08.810
<v Speaker 1>so good man.</v>

3914
01:54:08.811 --> 01:54:09.800
<v Speaker 1>He's so fucking funny.</v>

3915
01:54:10.220 --> 01:54:10.820
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

3916
01:54:10.820 --> 01:54:11.990
<v Speaker 1>but everybody knows Dunkin.</v>

3917
01:54:12.050 --> 01:54:12.320
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3918
01:54:12.320 --> 01:54:14.870
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of people know Dunkin because of the podcast world.</v>

3919
01:54:15.230 --> 01:54:17.360
<v Speaker 1>Ian is a guy who doesn't really have a big,</v>

3920
01:54:17.730 --> 01:54:19.460
<v Speaker 1>he was doing something with you for a while,</v>

3921
01:54:19.461 --> 01:54:19.730
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3922
01:54:19.730 --> 01:54:23.540
<v Speaker 1>The preposterous sessions kind of do what I do with the roast battle.</v>

3923
01:54:23.541 --> 01:54:25.610
<v Speaker 1>It just replayed it on desk squad for him.</v>

3924
01:54:25.790 --> 01:54:26.031
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3925
01:54:26.031 --> 01:54:27.550
<v Speaker 1>so it was his place,</v>

3926
01:54:27.560 --> 01:54:29.390
<v Speaker 1>his initials trying to help him out with the,</v>

3927
01:54:29.960 --> 01:54:30.351
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3928
01:54:30.351 --> 01:54:31.190
<v Speaker 1>he needs to,</v>

3929
01:54:31.430 --> 01:54:32.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is.</v>

3930
01:54:32.391 --> 01:54:35.810
<v Speaker 1>I think you just need to not write anymore on those shows because when you write</v>

3931
01:54:35.811 --> 01:54:36.261
<v Speaker 1>on those shows,</v>

3932
01:54:36.261 --> 01:54:37.094
<v Speaker 1>you can't tour.</v>

3933
01:54:37.130 --> 01:54:38.000
<v Speaker 1>You're stuck.</v>

3934
01:54:38.510 --> 01:54:38.841
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>

3935
01:54:38.841 --> 01:54:42.740
<v Speaker 1>he just turned down a big gig because they told him that he couldn't pitch</v>

3936
01:54:42.741 --> 01:54:43.574
<v Speaker 1>anything else.</v>

3937
01:54:43.670 --> 01:54:44.360
<v Speaker 1>They told him,</v>

3938
01:54:44.360 --> 01:54:44.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3939
01:54:44.570 --> 01:54:44.781
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3940
01:54:44.781 --> 01:54:47.360
<v Speaker 1>Kim Kim was going through this some shit right now with this.</v>

3941
01:54:47.600 --> 01:54:48.433
<v Speaker 1>These companies,</v>

3942
01:54:48.740 --> 01:54:52.370
<v Speaker 1>they get you and then they say that they own you intellectually,</v>

3943
01:54:52.371 --> 01:54:53.760
<v Speaker 1>not just while you're working there.</v>

3944
01:54:53.761 --> 01:54:55.430
<v Speaker 1>Like say if you write on a show,</v>

3945
01:54:55.580 --> 01:54:56.360
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3946
01:54:56.360 --> 01:54:57.140
<v Speaker 1>They don't want,</v>

3947
01:54:57.140 --> 01:55:00.170
<v Speaker 1>they want you to not just write on that show.</v>

3948
01:55:00.320 --> 01:55:01.340
<v Speaker 1>They want to own you.</v>

3949
01:55:01.341 --> 01:55:03.500
<v Speaker 1>If you have a movie script that you're writing on the side,</v>

3950
01:55:03.650 --> 01:55:04.431
<v Speaker 1>they want to own you.</v>

3951
01:55:04.431 --> 01:55:05.390
<v Speaker 1>If you have a book,</v>

3952
01:55:05.690 --> 01:55:08.060
<v Speaker 1>they decide because they can,</v>

3953
01:55:08.240 --> 01:55:08.780
<v Speaker 1>because they're,</v>

3954
01:55:08.780 --> 01:55:10.820
<v Speaker 1>their model is kind of rotting away.</v>

3955
01:55:11.030 --> 01:55:12.500
<v Speaker 1>Like the model of the Sitcom.</v>

3956
01:55:12.650 --> 01:55:13.490
<v Speaker 1>That's a fucking,</v>

3957
01:55:13.700 --> 01:55:16.910
<v Speaker 1>they used to be a lot of sitcoms back in the day,</v>

3958
01:55:17.090 --> 01:55:19.220
<v Speaker 1>like in the 90s when I was on news radio,</v>

3959
01:55:19.280 --> 01:55:20.540
<v Speaker 1>everything was a sitcom.</v>

3960
01:55:20.690 --> 01:55:24.830
<v Speaker 1>There was four or five sitcoms a night and you know you had sex in the city,</v>

3961
01:55:24.831 --> 01:55:25.970
<v Speaker 1>you had friends,</v>

3962
01:55:25.971 --> 01:55:27.020
<v Speaker 1>you had the single guy,</v>

3963
01:55:27.021 --> 01:55:29.720
<v Speaker 1>you had Caroline in the city for sex in the city.</v>

3964
01:55:29.721 --> 01:55:30.554
<v Speaker 1>I was confusing him.</v>

3965
01:55:30.860 --> 01:55:31.030
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

3966
01:55:31.030 --> 01:55:34.460
<v Speaker 1>you know you had all these different networks that all these different shows.</v>

3967
01:55:34.461 --> 01:55:35.720
<v Speaker 1>Everybody had sitcoms.</v>

3968
01:55:35.840 --> 01:55:37.520
<v Speaker 1>He had four or five sitcoms a week,</v>

3969
01:55:37.521 --> 01:55:37.851
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>

3970
01:55:37.851 --> 01:55:38.930
<v Speaker 1>seven sitcoms a week,</v>

3971
01:55:39.110 --> 01:55:40.220
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck the number was.</v>

3972
01:55:40.221 --> 01:55:40.821
<v Speaker 1>He had dramas,</v>

3973
01:55:40.821 --> 01:55:41.654
<v Speaker 1>all these different shows.</v>

3974
01:55:41.830 --> 01:55:43.980
<v Speaker 1>They're dying now.</v>

3975
01:55:44.190 --> 01:55:45.023
<v Speaker 1>They have a few,</v>

3976
01:55:45.180 --> 01:55:47.880
<v Speaker 1>you know you have like undateable this doing that weird shit where they're</v>

3977
01:55:47.881 --> 01:55:49.200
<v Speaker 1>trying to do a live version of it.</v>

3978
01:55:49.201 --> 01:55:49.351
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3979
01:55:49.351 --> 01:55:50.184
<v Speaker 1>We'll talk about that.</v>

3980
01:55:50.370 --> 01:55:51.360
<v Speaker 1>And then you have like,</v>

3981
01:55:52.050 --> 01:55:56.940
<v Speaker 1>I guess two broke girls is still doing Freilla Big Bang theory is Big Bang</v>

3982
01:55:56.941 --> 01:55:57.580
<v Speaker 1>theory.</v>

3983
01:55:57.580 --> 01:55:58.980
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me like,</v>

3984
01:55:59.460 --> 01:55:59.911
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

3985
01:55:59.911 --> 01:56:02.070
<v Speaker 1>you know how they do that music that they play for the Cobra,</v>

3986
01:56:02.270 --> 01:56:05.450
<v Speaker 9>Eh,</v>

3987
01:56:05.760 --> 01:56:06.481
<v Speaker 1>and then the Cobra,</v>

3988
01:56:06.481 --> 01:56:07.830
<v Speaker 1>just like he can't move,</v>

3989
01:56:07.890 --> 01:56:09.150
<v Speaker 1>he gets hypnotized by the music.</v>

3990
01:56:09.510 --> 01:56:11.700
<v Speaker 1>I think that is what happens with retards.</v>

3991
01:56:11.701 --> 01:56:12.930
<v Speaker 1>When they watched the Big Bang theory,</v>

3992
01:56:13.320 --> 01:56:18.030
<v Speaker 1>I think it's somehow or another guest them to tune in just long enough to play</v>

3993
01:56:18.031 --> 01:56:20.220
<v Speaker 1>those commercials and then it ends and they go,</v>

3994
01:56:20.221 --> 01:56:20.911
<v Speaker 1>what just happened?</v>

3995
01:56:20.911 --> 01:56:21.690
<v Speaker 1>And they wake up.</v>

3996
01:56:21.690 --> 01:56:22.650
<v Speaker 1>What did I just watch?</v>

3997
01:56:24.330 --> 01:56:25.770
<v Speaker 1>There's only a few now though.</v>

3998
01:56:25.860 --> 01:56:27.000
<v Speaker 1>So because of that,</v>

3999
01:56:27.330 --> 01:56:29.880
<v Speaker 1>they want to own everybody.</v>

4000
01:56:29.910 --> 01:56:30.810
<v Speaker 1>They want to own,</v>

4001
01:56:30.900 --> 01:56:32.670
<v Speaker 1>they want to own all the stuff he did.</v>

4002
01:56:32.880 --> 01:56:33.990
<v Speaker 1>Now what our friend Kim,</v>

4003
01:56:34.170 --> 01:56:36.870
<v Speaker 1>it gets even crazier because she's not even a writer.</v>

4004
01:56:37.050 --> 01:56:39.570
<v Speaker 1>She's employed as a secretary for a company.</v>

4005
01:56:39.870 --> 01:56:41.610
<v Speaker 1>And this the company that she's employed,</v>

4006
01:56:41.611 --> 01:56:42.444
<v Speaker 1>four options.</v>

4007
01:56:42.660 --> 01:56:43.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4008
01:56:43.110 --> 01:56:43.650
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>

4009
01:56:43.650 --> 01:56:44.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4010
01:56:44.380 --> 01:56:49.380
<v Speaker 1>The company that she's employed for wants to own a project that she's created.</v>

4011
01:56:49.650 --> 01:56:49.950
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4012
01:56:49.950 --> 01:56:51.120
<v Speaker 2>I kind of her own,</v>

4013
01:56:51.150 --> 01:56:52.920
<v Speaker 2>I kind of get where they're coming from.</v>

4014
01:56:52.950 --> 01:56:53.820
<v Speaker 2>How um,</v>

4015
01:56:53.910 --> 01:56:57.300
<v Speaker 2>because she works at a place that there's a lot of,</v>

4016
01:56:57.420 --> 01:56:58.920
<v Speaker 2>they make a lot of shows.</v>

4017
01:56:58.950 --> 01:56:59.311
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

4018
01:56:59.311 --> 01:57:02.160
<v Speaker 2>So she has to interact with a lot of important people.</v>

4019
01:57:02.161 --> 01:57:05.010
<v Speaker 2>She sees a lot of things behind the scenes.</v>

4020
01:57:05.220 --> 01:57:08.340
<v Speaker 2>So what they do that for is like a basic thing in Hollywood.</v>

4021
01:57:08.341 --> 01:57:10.620
<v Speaker 2>So where she can't tell the competition like,</v>

4022
01:57:10.800 --> 01:57:11.341
<v Speaker 2>Oh hey,</v>

4023
01:57:11.341 --> 01:57:11.731
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4024
01:57:11.731 --> 01:57:15.120
<v Speaker 2>a Jeff Foxworthy is going to be on the next show and uh,</v>

4025
01:57:15.121 --> 01:57:15.371
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4026
01:57:15.371 --> 01:57:18.320
<v Speaker 2>it's just a confidentiality waiver there.</v>

4027
01:57:18.390 --> 01:57:21.330
<v Speaker 2>They're pretty much saying is that's not according to her.</v>

4028
01:57:21.360 --> 01:57:22.171
<v Speaker 2>I think you're wrong.</v>

4029
01:57:22.171 --> 01:57:24.270
<v Speaker 2>I've read what she said and once you sent me,</v>

4030
01:57:24.430 --> 01:57:25.150
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

4031
01:57:25.150 --> 01:57:25.500
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>

4032
01:57:25.500 --> 01:57:25.950
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>

4033
01:57:25.950 --> 01:57:29.010
<v Speaker 2>I talked to her last night and she said she made it seem like their reasoning is</v>

4034
01:57:29.040 --> 01:57:31.560
<v Speaker 2>that they don't want me to create like the,</v>

4035
01:57:31.820 --> 01:57:35.970
<v Speaker 2>like the like a show using secrets that they use,</v>

4036
01:57:35.971 --> 01:57:36.421
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4037
01:57:36.421 --> 01:57:37.111
<v Speaker 2>on the side,</v>

4038
01:57:37.111 --> 01:57:37.381
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4039
01:57:37.381 --> 01:57:37.770
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

4040
01:57:37.770 --> 01:57:38.820
<v Speaker 2>cause she's open.</v>

4041
01:57:39.390 --> 01:57:40.800
<v Speaker 2>She's who a lot of secrets.</v>

4042
01:57:40.801 --> 01:57:41.410
<v Speaker 2>A lot of</v>

4043
01:57:41.410 --> 01:57:42.370
<v Speaker 1>the words.</v>

4044
01:57:42.450 --> 01:57:42.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4045
01:57:42.670 --> 01:57:44.110
<v Speaker 1>We own your brain.</v>

4046
01:57:44.820 --> 01:57:45.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4047
01:57:45.160 --> 01:57:45.993
<v Speaker 1>that's what they said there.</v>

4048
01:57:46.160 --> 01:57:46.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4049
01:57:46.620 --> 01:57:47.261
<v Speaker 1>A lot of places.</v>

4050
01:57:47.261 --> 01:57:49.210
<v Speaker 1>We own your brain while you work here.</v>

4051
01:57:49.211 --> 01:57:50.044
<v Speaker 1>We own your brain.</v>

4052
01:57:50.260 --> 01:57:51.093
<v Speaker 1>That's retarded.</v>

4053
01:57:51.610 --> 01:57:52.360
<v Speaker 1>That's retarded.</v>

4054
01:57:52.360 --> 01:57:55.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck what reasoning they have.</v>

4055
01:57:55.960 --> 01:57:57.790
<v Speaker 1>She's a secretary or receptionist,</v>

4056
01:57:57.791 --> 01:57:58.061
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

4057
01:57:58.061 --> 01:57:58.894
<v Speaker 1>She answers phones.</v>

4058
01:57:59.410 --> 01:58:02.950
<v Speaker 1>If they wanted to sign a confidentiality agreement you do that.</v>

4059
01:58:03.580 --> 01:58:05.920
<v Speaker 1>But the idea that they say that her,</v>

4060
01:58:05.921 --> 01:58:06.910
<v Speaker 1>we own your brain,</v>

4061
01:58:06.940 --> 01:58:08.380
<v Speaker 1>they want to own her project,</v>

4062
01:58:08.560 --> 01:58:10.480
<v Speaker 1>they want to own the projects that she creates.</v>

4063
01:58:10.510 --> 01:58:11.343
<v Speaker 1>That particular,</v>

4064
01:58:11.460 --> 01:58:15.660
<v Speaker 2>I think things she worked for though is very close to TV shows.</v>

4065
01:58:15.661 --> 01:58:20.370
<v Speaker 2>So like they can't have somebody just making and TV shows based off secrets that</v>

4066
01:58:21.010 --> 01:58:21.880
<v Speaker 1>the secrets,</v>

4067
01:58:22.390 --> 01:58:22.901
<v Speaker 1>see look,</v>

4068
01:58:22.901 --> 01:58:23.980
<v Speaker 1>if you smell something,</v>

4069
01:58:24.750 --> 01:58:25.690
<v Speaker 1>but what does that look?</v>

4070
01:58:25.691 --> 01:58:28.780
<v Speaker 1>That's the purpose of her working for some place where you making shit money</v>

4071
01:58:28.960 --> 01:58:30.070
<v Speaker 1>when you work as an intern.</v>

4072
01:58:30.071 --> 01:58:32.620
<v Speaker 1>So if you work for an intern for the opiate Anthony show or whatever,</v>

4073
01:58:33.480 --> 01:58:34.140
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

4074
01:58:34.140 --> 01:58:34.930
<v Speaker 1>the reason why you're not,</v>

4075
01:58:34.930 --> 01:58:37.600
<v Speaker 1>they're not paying you shit is because you're learning about the business.</v>

4076
01:58:37.601 --> 01:58:37.781
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

4077
01:58:37.781 --> 01:58:38.230
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>

4078
01:58:38.230 --> 01:58:40.990
<v Speaker 1>well we're going to not pay you anything and then what are you going to do?</v>

4079
01:58:41.080 --> 01:58:42.010
<v Speaker 1>You got to learn shit</v>

4080
01:58:42.010 --> 01:58:42.311
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>

4081
01:58:42.311 --> 01:58:45.400
<v Speaker 4>And the figured out on your own and then you can't be my slave anymore.</v>

4082
01:58:45.580 --> 01:58:49.810
<v Speaker 4>That's ridiculous that that company's full of cuts that that's a country</v>

4083
01:58:49.811 --> 01:58:50.644
<v Speaker 4>company.</v>

4084
01:58:50.920 --> 01:58:51.700
<v Speaker 4>Like why?</v>

4085
01:58:51.700 --> 01:58:52.271
<v Speaker 4>Why would he,</v>

4086
01:58:52.271 --> 01:58:53.680
<v Speaker 4>why are you paying her five bucks an hour?</v>

4087
01:58:53.681 --> 01:58:54.071
<v Speaker 4>They're like wait,</v>

4088
01:58:54.071 --> 01:58:54.461
<v Speaker 4>or whatever.</v>

4089
01:58:54.461 --> 01:58:56.390
<v Speaker 4>She's getting some getting much like Wah.</v>

4090
01:58:56.500 --> 01:58:58.190
<v Speaker 4>That's the whole purpose of working in a,</v>

4091
01:58:58.390 --> 01:59:00.670
<v Speaker 4>an entry level Gig is you supposed to learn,</v>

4092
01:59:00.970 --> 01:59:02.560
<v Speaker 4>well you're going to took it and you're going to learn.</v>

4093
01:59:02.561 --> 01:59:03.790
<v Speaker 4>You need going to go profit elsewhere.</v>

4094
01:59:03.910 --> 01:59:05.560
<v Speaker 4>It's one thing if she steals an idea,</v>

4095
01:59:05.710 --> 01:59:06.521
<v Speaker 4>she steals an idea,</v>

4096
01:59:06.521 --> 01:59:07.354
<v Speaker 4>they should sewer.</v>

4097
01:59:07.570 --> 01:59:09.180
<v Speaker 4>But if she's not stealing ideas,</v>

4098
01:59:09.181 --> 01:59:12.580
<v Speaker 4>if she just learning about the business and you're trying to penalize her or</v>

4099
01:59:12.581 --> 01:59:13.030
<v Speaker 4>you're trying to,</v>

4100
01:59:13.030 --> 01:59:15.070
<v Speaker 4>they're trying to own what she's doing,</v>

4101
01:59:15.250 --> 01:59:15.581
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4102
01:59:15.581 --> 01:59:17.110
<v Speaker 4>not just like kinda own it,</v>

4103
01:59:17.260 --> 01:59:18.041
<v Speaker 4>but according to her,</v>

4104
01:59:18.041 --> 01:59:19.210
<v Speaker 4>they want to own it.</v>

4105
01:59:19.450 --> 01:59:21.520
<v Speaker 4>They want to own everything she does when she works there.</v>

4106
01:59:22.210 --> 01:59:23.043
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy.</v>

4107
01:59:23.530 --> 01:59:25.480
<v Speaker 4>But that's also why he shouldn't have a job like that.</v>

4108
01:59:25.770 --> 01:59:26.800
<v Speaker 4>She should just be a comic.</v>

4109
01:59:27.550 --> 01:59:28.151
<v Speaker 4>Just struggle.</v>

4110
01:59:28.151 --> 01:59:28.984
<v Speaker 4>Get a waitress job.</v>

01:59:29.920 --> 01:59:30.753
<v Speaker 4>everybody wants to</v>

4114
01:59:30.860 --> 01:59:32.770
<v Speaker 2>like nothing wrong with waitress jobs.</v>

4115
01:59:32.771 --> 01:59:33.550
<v Speaker 2>They're fine.</v>

4116
01:59:33.550 --> 01:59:34.383
<v Speaker 2>It's good.</v>

4117
01:59:34.840 --> 01:59:37.960
<v Speaker 2>Unless you waitressing on fat Tuesday at the comedy store.</v>

4118
01:59:37.990 --> 01:59:38.470
<v Speaker 2>Fuck,</v>

4119
01:59:38.470 --> 01:59:39.700
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't exist anymore.</v>

4120
01:59:39.850 --> 01:59:40.870
<v Speaker 2>Do you watch the daily show?</v>

4121
01:59:40.871 --> 01:59:41.950
<v Speaker 2>Do you like this new guy?</v>

4122
01:59:42.310 --> 01:59:44.860
<v Speaker 2>Cause I saw you tweet something the other day about it and I don't know if you</v>

4124
01:59:45.161 --> 01:59:46.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean I tried to watch it.</v>

4125
01:59:46.560 --> 01:59:48.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm not on board with that guy.</v>

4126
01:59:48.520 --> 01:59:49.360
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen it yet.</v>

4127
01:59:49.670 --> 01:59:50.120

4128
01:59:50.120 --> 01:59:51.110
<v Speaker 4>but there,</v>

4130
01:59:52.430 --> 01:59:53.900
<v Speaker 4>there's a Russell Peters thing.</v>

4131
01:59:54.200 --> 01:59:54.381
<v Speaker 4>We're,</v>

4132
01:59:54.381 --> 01:59:56.060
<v Speaker 4>Russell Peters said that the guy's a thief.</v>

4133
01:59:56.300 --> 01:59:57.440
<v Speaker 4>And then after he said,</v>

4134
01:59:57.441 --> 01:59:58.274
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4135
01:59:58.430 --> 01:59:58.701
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4136
01:59:58.701 --> 01:59:59.960
<v Speaker 4>he said the guy stole from him,</v>

4137
01:59:59.961 --> 02:00:00.980
<v Speaker 4>guys stole from someone else.</v>

4138
02:00:01.310 --> 02:00:03.470
<v Speaker 4>I saw the bit that Russell said he stole from him.</v>

4139
02:00:03.471 --> 02:00:04.850
<v Speaker 4>It's the same exact premise.</v>

4140
02:00:05.030 --> 02:00:06.170
<v Speaker 4>And if you saw Russell do it,</v>

4141
02:00:06.171 --> 02:00:07.430
<v Speaker 4>that's probably exactly where he got it from.</v>

4142
02:00:08.210 --> 02:00:10.220
<v Speaker 4>And then there was a thing where he recently did a bit,</v>

4143
02:00:10.880 --> 02:00:13.710
<v Speaker 4>there was a straight up Dave Chappelle bit from like a,</v>

4144
02:00:13.770 --> 02:00:14.810
<v Speaker 4>the early two thousands,</v>

4145
02:00:14.811 --> 02:00:15.170
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4146
02:00:15.170 --> 02:00:15.800
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4147
02:00:15.800 --> 02:00:16.290
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

4148
02:00:16.290 --> 02:00:17.920
<v Speaker 4>100% that was banked.</v>

4149
02:00:18.680 --> 02:00:19.490
<v Speaker 4>It was the same.</v>

4150
02:00:19.490 --> 02:00:19.941
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't,</v>

4151
02:00:19.941 --> 02:00:21.080
<v Speaker 4>it was the same wording.</v>

4152
02:00:21.200 --> 02:00:22.220
<v Speaker 4>Same premise,</v>

4153
02:00:22.340 --> 02:00:23.150
<v Speaker 4>same everything,</v>

4154
02:00:23.150 --> 02:00:24.740
<v Speaker 4>and it's a Dave Chappelle bit,</v>

4155
02:00:24.741 --> 02:00:25.640
<v Speaker 4>so you know that bit.</v>

4156
02:00:25.850 --> 02:00:27.110
<v Speaker 4>So if you're a standup comic,</v>

4157
02:00:27.111 --> 02:00:27.944
<v Speaker 4>you know that bit.</v>

4158
02:00:28.130 --> 02:00:29.650
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's like Louis C.</v>

4159
02:00:29.650 --> 02:00:30.830
<v Speaker 4>Case bag of Dicks joke.</v>

4160
02:00:31.010 --> 02:00:34.640
<v Speaker 4>There's like jokes that like you kind of know or like a Cosby.</v>

4161
02:00:34.700 --> 02:00:35.031
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4162
02:00:35.031 --> 02:00:35.271
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

4163
02:00:35.271 --> 02:00:37.700
<v Speaker 4>The Noah's Ark bit or like a,</v>

4164
02:00:37.790 --> 02:00:38.623
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4165
02:00:38.780 --> 02:00:41.750
<v Speaker 4>Richard Pryor's vampire bit vampire in the hood.</v>

4166
02:00:42.230 --> 02:00:43.310
<v Speaker 4>You know that bit man,</v>

4167
02:00:43.350 --> 02:00:47.630
<v Speaker 4>there's a class at Sam Kinison is having sex with the homosexual necrophiliac</v>

4168
02:00:47.631 --> 02:00:47.961
<v Speaker 4>joke.</v>

4169
02:00:47.961 --> 02:00:48.790
<v Speaker 4>That bit,</v>

4170
02:00:48.790 --> 02:00:49.520
<v Speaker 4>you know that bit.</v>

4171
02:00:49.520 --> 02:00:50.353
<v Speaker 4>People know that bit.</v>

4172
02:00:50.390 --> 02:00:51.021
<v Speaker 4>So if you,</v>

4173
02:00:51.021 --> 02:00:52.280
<v Speaker 4>if you try to steal that,</v>

4174
02:00:52.460 --> 02:00:53.330
<v Speaker 4>come on son,</v>

4175
02:00:53.570 --> 02:00:54.403
<v Speaker 4>you can't,</v>

4176
02:00:55.060 --> 02:00:55.893
<v Speaker 4>then you get it.</v>

4177
02:00:56.030 --> 02:00:56.580
<v Speaker 4>He didn't,</v>

4178
02:00:56.580 --> 02:00:57.740
<v Speaker 4>didn't mix it up a little,</v>

4179
02:00:58.130 --> 02:00:58.521
<v Speaker 4>but he,</v>

4180
02:00:58.521 --> 02:00:59.990
<v Speaker 4>he mixed it up a little with,</v>

4181
02:00:59.991 --> 02:01:00.770
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4182
02:01:00.770 --> 02:01:01.700
<v Speaker 4>with Russell,</v>

4183
02:01:01.760 --> 02:01:02.301
<v Speaker 4>with Russell,</v>

4184
02:01:02.301 --> 02:01:05.630
<v Speaker 4>you could tell the origin was most likely the same.</v>

4185
02:01:05.750 --> 02:01:06.950
<v Speaker 4>Did he probably saw Russell do it,</v>

4186
02:01:06.951 --> 02:01:10.520
<v Speaker 4>but it's a race joke and it's vague enough.</v>

4187
02:01:10.630 --> 02:01:11.090
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

4188
02:01:11.090 --> 02:01:11.841
<v Speaker 4>and the way he did,</v>

4189
02:01:11.841 --> 02:01:12.200
<v Speaker 4>he did,</v>

4190
02:01:12.200 --> 02:01:13.400
<v Speaker 4>he danced around it enough.</v>

4191
02:01:13.560 --> 02:01:14.393
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4192
02:01:14.700 --> 02:01:15.740
<v Speaker 2>Russell in that interview,</v>

4193
02:01:15.800 --> 02:01:16.141
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

4194
02:01:16.141 --> 02:01:18.130
<v Speaker 2>that woman that interviewed Ralph Soul in that,</v>

4195
02:01:18.530 --> 02:01:19.363
<v Speaker 2>oh my gosh.</v>

4196
02:01:19.560 --> 02:01:20.240
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>

4197
02:01:20.240 --> 02:01:24.810
<v Speaker 2>she's not jealous cause he's hotter and skinnier and skinnier.</v>

4198
02:01:24.990 --> 02:01:25.411
<v Speaker 2>Cuter.</v>

4199
02:01:25.411 --> 02:01:26.244
<v Speaker 2>She said,</v>

4200
02:01:26.510 --> 02:01:26.940
<v Speaker 2>Russell,</v>

4201
02:01:26.940 --> 02:01:27.970
<v Speaker 2>you can tell he got,</v>

4202
02:01:27.971 --> 02:01:30.330
<v Speaker 2>he also mentions another person that he stole from.</v>

4203
02:01:30.400 --> 02:01:32.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't know any other comic is,</v>

4204
02:01:32.100 --> 02:01:34.140
<v Speaker 2>but it seems like a smoke versus fire thing.</v>

4205
02:01:34.141 --> 02:01:35.490
<v Speaker 2>Definitely smoked smoking fire.</v>

4206
02:01:35.550 --> 02:01:36.300
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4207
02:01:36.300 --> 02:01:36.870
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4208
02:01:36.870 --> 02:01:37.703
<v Speaker 4>Most.</v>

4209
02:01:37.980 --> 02:01:38.730
<v Speaker 4>Most likely.</v>

4210
02:01:38.730 --> 02:01:38.941
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4211
02:01:38.941 --> 02:01:39.730
<v Speaker 4>And he's there.</v>

4212
02:01:39.730 --> 02:01:40.130
<v Speaker 4>They're hanging</v>

4213
02:01:40.130 --> 02:01:40.640
<v Speaker 1>out though.</v>

4214
02:01:40.640 --> 02:01:42.560
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that who gives a fuck?</v>

4215
02:01:42.890 --> 02:01:43.300
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

4216
02:01:43.300 --> 02:01:44.133
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

4217
02:01:44.180 --> 02:01:46.100
<v Speaker 1>Dave probably doesn't read low Internet.</v>

4218
02:01:46.410 --> 02:01:47.470
<v Speaker 1>He's probably not even online.</v>

4219
02:01:48.110 --> 02:01:48.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4220
02:01:48.750 --> 02:01:49.520
<v Speaker 1>it's true.</v>

4221
02:01:49.520 --> 02:01:50.690
<v Speaker 1>Probably has no idea it happened.</v>

4222
02:01:51.020 --> 02:01:51.591
<v Speaker 1>People getting,</v>

4223
02:01:51.591 --> 02:01:52.011
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>

4224
02:01:52.011 --> 02:01:52.300
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

4225
02:01:52.300 --> 02:01:53.050
<v Speaker 1>hmm.</v>

4226
02:01:53.050 --> 02:01:54.320
<v Speaker 1>So they stole his jokes,</v>

4227
02:01:54.321 --> 02:01:55.070
<v Speaker 1>but their friends.</v>

4228
02:01:55.070 --> 02:01:55.251
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4229
02:01:55.251 --> 02:01:55.551
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

4230
02:01:55.551 --> 02:01:56.121
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

4231
02:01:56.121 --> 02:01:58.280
<v Speaker 1>if you're a calculated guy like Trevor Noah,</v>

4232
02:01:58.520 --> 02:01:59.353
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4233
02:01:59.480 --> 02:02:01.280
<v Speaker 1>Why wouldn't you do that when you put this up,</v>

4234
02:02:01.430 --> 02:02:04.490
<v Speaker 1>what is it a fucking coincidence that a couple of days later he takes his</v>

4235
02:02:04.491 --> 02:02:07.490
<v Speaker 1>picture with Dave and who knows when this picture happened?</v>

4236
02:02:07.870 --> 02:02:08.171
<v Speaker 1>When?</v>

4237
02:02:08.171 --> 02:02:09.710
<v Speaker 1>When did this picture take place?</v>

4238
02:02:10.880 --> 02:02:11.451
<v Speaker 1>Did the pig,</v>

4239
02:02:11.451 --> 02:02:13.160
<v Speaker 1>but did the photo get taken yesterday?</v>

4240
02:02:13.550 --> 02:02:17.870
<v Speaker 1>They went out to dinner or lunch yesterday before that Mark Twain thing that</v>

4241
02:02:17.871 --> 02:02:18.810
<v Speaker 1>Eddie Murphy was just app.</v>

4242
02:02:18.811 --> 02:02:20.000
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of comedians together.</v>

4243
02:02:20.090 --> 02:02:20.780
<v Speaker 1>Well who,</v>

4244
02:02:20.780 --> 02:02:21.350
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

4245
02:02:21.350 --> 02:02:22.310
<v Speaker 1>well maybe he,</v>

4246
02:02:22.311 --> 02:02:22.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4247
02:02:22.700 --> 02:02:23.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4248
02:02:23.120 --> 02:02:25.880
<v Speaker 1>got together with day because he wanted to talk to him about it and tell him he</v>

4249
02:02:25.881 --> 02:02:26.990
<v Speaker 1>had no idea or blah,</v>

4250
02:02:26.991 --> 02:02:27.141
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

4251
02:02:27.141 --> 02:02:27.321
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

4252
02:02:27.321 --> 02:02:27.471
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

4253
02:02:27.471 --> 02:02:28.100
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>

4254
02:02:28.100 --> 02:02:29.510
<v Speaker 1>But when Russell did it,</v>

4255
02:02:29.511 --> 02:02:34.511
<v Speaker 1>Russell said that he had this massive media backlash after he said the guy was a</v>

4256
02:02:35.061 --> 02:02:37.220
<v Speaker 1>thief and then he said it was a prank.</v>

4257
02:02:37.340 --> 02:02:38.360
<v Speaker 1>He said it was a prank.</v>

4258
02:02:38.720 --> 02:02:41.570
<v Speaker 1>Now in the interest of confidentiality,</v>

4259
02:02:41.720 --> 02:02:42.920
<v Speaker 1>I will go no further.</v>

4260
02:02:43.070 --> 02:02:43.490
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4261
02:02:43.490 --> 02:02:45.110
<v Speaker 1>But you can fucking do the math.</v>

4262
02:02:45.140 --> 02:02:50.140
<v Speaker 1>I think my personal gas would be that it wasn't a prank.</v>

4263
02:02:50.930 --> 02:02:51.640
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4264
02:02:51.640 --> 02:02:52.760
<v Speaker 1>we don't need to go further.</v>

4265
02:02:52.980 --> 02:02:54.800
<v Speaker 1>That's what go no further means Brian.</v>

4266
02:02:55.790 --> 02:02:56.061
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

4267
02:02:56.061 --> 02:02:56.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4268
02:02:56.420 --> 02:02:56.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4269
02:02:56.860 --> 02:02:58.580
<v Speaker 1>Russell's the nicest fucking guy on the planet earth.</v>

4270
02:02:58.610 --> 02:02:59.443
<v Speaker 1>He really is.</v>

4271
02:02:59.540 --> 02:03:01.190
<v Speaker 1>If Russell Peter says you're a piece of shit,</v>

4272
02:03:01.450 --> 02:03:01.701
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

4273
02:03:01.701 --> 02:03:02.534
<v Speaker 1>I tend to,</v>

4274
02:03:02.660 --> 02:03:03.500
<v Speaker 1>I tend to agree.</v>

4275
02:03:03.950 --> 02:03:05.000
<v Speaker 1>I usually,</v>

4276
02:03:05.080 --> 02:03:05.271
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4277
02:03:05.271 --> 02:03:05.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

4278
02:03:05.930 --> 02:03:08.330
<v Speaker 1>but it's whatever,</v>

4279
02:03:08.331 --> 02:03:08.820
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4280
02:03:08.820 --> 02:03:09.170
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4281
02:03:09.170 --> 02:03:12.080
<v Speaker 1>you also got to realize this fucking dude was doing it in South Africa.</v>

4282
02:03:12.320 --> 02:03:13.430
<v Speaker 1>That's like being on the moon.</v>

4283
02:03:13.670 --> 02:03:15.020
<v Speaker 1>It's like doing standup on the moon.</v>

4284
02:03:15.200 --> 02:03:16.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a few comics there I'm sure,</v>

4285
02:03:16.971 --> 02:03:20.000
<v Speaker 1>but they're seen is it's so,</v>

4286
02:03:20.620 --> 02:03:25.620
<v Speaker 1>it might have been their style to do other people shit and I'm a not exonerating</v>

4287
02:03:27.471 --> 02:03:28.304
<v Speaker 1>him in any way,</v>

4288
02:03:28.370 --> 02:03:30.830
<v Speaker 1>but you got to think like if you're at a band,</v>

4289
02:03:30.890 --> 02:03:33.080
<v Speaker 1>okay and you're in fucking Florida,</v>

4290
02:03:33.500 --> 02:03:34.333
<v Speaker 1>guess what?</v>

4291
02:03:34.490 --> 02:03:36.290
<v Speaker 1>You're going to do other people's music.</v>

4292
02:03:36.560 --> 02:03:36.861
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4293
02:03:36.861 --> 02:03:40.400
<v Speaker 1>if you really want to be a big band and you're learning and one day you guys</v>

4294
02:03:40.401 --> 02:03:41.234
<v Speaker 1>want to be huge,</v>

4295
02:03:41.240 --> 02:03:45.080
<v Speaker 1>you're going to do some cover songs and in the world of stand up,</v>

4296
02:03:45.110 --> 02:03:47.180
<v Speaker 1>you don't do that in the world of stand up.</v>

4297
02:03:47.210 --> 02:03:48.170
<v Speaker 1>You can't get away with that.</v>

4298
02:03:48.171 --> 02:03:53.171
<v Speaker 1>But I guarantee you there are some people right now that could be really good</v>

4299
02:03:53.331 --> 02:03:57.680
<v Speaker 1>comedians some day and they're in some really obscure market in the middle of</v>

4300
02:03:57.681 --> 02:03:58.101
<v Speaker 1>nowhere.</v>

4301
02:03:58.101 --> 02:04:03.101
<v Speaker 1>Or perhaps they're in some place that speaks Dutch or some places speaks French</v>

4302
02:04:03.500 --> 02:04:05.600
<v Speaker 1>and they're stealing some bill Cosby bit right now,</v>

4303
02:04:05.601 --> 02:04:07.280
<v Speaker 1>or they're stealing some bill hicks bid right now.</v>

4304
02:04:07.340 --> 02:04:09.140
<v Speaker 1>That was always a big thing with Hicks.</v>

4305
02:04:09.780 --> 02:04:10.880
<v Speaker 1>There was a guy in Amsterdam,</v>

4306
02:04:11.090 --> 02:04:14.750
<v Speaker 1>there was doing standup and Dutch and he was just stealing all of Bill Hicks is</v>

4307
02:04:14.751 --> 02:04:15.440
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

4308
02:04:15.440 --> 02:04:18.590
<v Speaker 1>But some other guy who is bilingual realized it and it was like,</v>

4309
02:04:18.591 --> 02:04:20.450
<v Speaker 1>what is this in Montreal?</v>

4310
02:04:20.451 --> 02:04:21.440
<v Speaker 1>It's a huge issue.</v>

4311
02:04:21.740 --> 02:04:23.920
<v Speaker 1>The French people up there like the,</v>

4312
02:04:23.921 --> 02:04:28.390
<v Speaker 1>the French speaking to do French speaking shows and these guys will just gag</v>

4313
02:04:28.400 --> 02:04:29.420
<v Speaker 1>dude's material,</v>

4314
02:04:29.540 --> 02:04:32.930
<v Speaker 1>just Yank American's material and just translate it into France.</v>

4315
02:04:33.180 --> 02:04:34.550
<v Speaker 1>They don't leave that area.</v>

4316
02:04:34.820 --> 02:04:35.250
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

4317
02:04:35.250 --> 02:04:38.490
<v Speaker 1>it's a very centralized area</v>

4318
02:04:38.640 --> 02:04:40.770
<v Speaker 4>like Montreal and Quebec.</v>

4319
02:04:40.800 --> 02:04:41.633
<v Speaker 4>Totally like they,</v>

4320
02:04:41.790 --> 02:04:42.960
<v Speaker 4>they're very proud.</v>

4321
02:04:42.961 --> 02:04:47.010
<v Speaker 4>There's a giant population of French speaking people and you can get away with</v>

4322
02:04:47.011 --> 02:04:49.530
<v Speaker 4>doing a French speaking act and steal a bunch of shit.</v>

4323
02:04:50.040 --> 02:04:52.800
<v Speaker 4>But if they are doing that,</v>

4324
02:04:52.801 --> 02:04:53.370
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

4325
02:04:53.370 --> 02:04:54.510
<v Speaker 4>if they're listening to this,</v>

4326
02:04:54.780 --> 02:04:55.650
<v Speaker 4>you got to stop.</v>

4327
02:04:55.930 --> 02:04:57.120
<v Speaker 4>It's gonna fuck you up.</v>

4328
02:04:57.510 --> 02:04:58.410
<v Speaker 4>It's going to ruin you.</v>

4329
02:04:59.280 --> 02:05:00.270
<v Speaker 4>It's going to fuck you up.</v>

4330
02:05:00.300 --> 02:05:00.960
<v Speaker 4>Even if you know,</v>

4331
02:05:00.960 --> 02:05:02.400
<v Speaker 4>even if you're getting away with it now,</v>

4332
02:05:02.760 --> 02:05:03.031
<v Speaker 4>you'll,</v>

4333
02:05:03.031 --> 02:05:07.980
<v Speaker 4>you'll develop tendencies and you're going to want to steal when things aren't</v>

4334
02:05:07.981 --> 02:05:08.814
<v Speaker 4>going well.</v>

4335
02:05:08.820 --> 02:05:09.181
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4336
02:05:09.181 --> 02:05:11.730
<v Speaker 4>and that's those moments when things aren't going well.</v>

4337
02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:13.740
<v Speaker 4>That's what defines you as a comic.</v>

4338
02:05:14.340 --> 02:05:15.930
<v Speaker 4>That's what pulls you out of the fire.</v>

4339
02:05:16.560 --> 02:05:20.550
<v Speaker 4>There's moments I will tank bits on purpose when I'm working on shit.</v>

4340
02:05:20.850 --> 02:05:23.100
<v Speaker 4>I will take the energy down.</v>

4341
02:05:23.340 --> 02:05:23.881
<v Speaker 4>I will,</v>

4342
02:05:23.881 --> 02:05:27.330
<v Speaker 4>I will put myself in bad positions because it's the only way you will.</v>

4343
02:05:27.390 --> 02:05:31.740
<v Speaker 4>You learn how to get out of them and figure out what if I don't believe in a bit</v>

4344
02:05:31.741 --> 02:05:32.550
<v Speaker 4>that much.</v>

4345
02:05:32.550 --> 02:05:36.630
<v Speaker 4>I'll do a strong part of a bit and then I'll back off of it and almost like put</v>

4346
02:05:36.631 --> 02:05:40.860
<v Speaker 4>myself in a scared spot where I have to flail around to try to find a punchline.</v>

4347
02:05:41.040 --> 02:05:45.150
<v Speaker 4>I always have another bit on the ready to jump in with to to bring the crowd</v>

4348
02:05:45.151 --> 02:05:45.451
<v Speaker 4>back,</v>

4349
02:05:45.451 --> 02:05:48.150
<v Speaker 4>but if you don't do that and everybody does that,</v>

4350
02:05:48.151 --> 02:05:49.230
<v Speaker 4>Diaz does it that way.</v>

4351
02:05:49.231 --> 02:05:49.471
<v Speaker 4>Our,</v>

4352
02:05:49.471 --> 02:05:50.400
<v Speaker 4>he does it that way.</v>

4353
02:05:50.640 --> 02:05:51.840
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people do it that way.</v>

4354
02:05:51.841 --> 02:05:52.260
<v Speaker 4>We all,</v>

4355
02:05:52.260 --> 02:05:53.370
<v Speaker 4>we've talked about it.</v>

4356
02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:57.330
<v Speaker 4>We do it that way because that's the way you find CHIBE got to go out in the</v>

4357
02:05:57.331 --> 02:06:00.420
<v Speaker 4>deep water and people don't want to go on that deep water.</v>

4358
02:06:00.810 --> 02:06:01.350
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

4359
02:06:01.350 --> 02:06:02.580
<v Speaker 4>those guys who steal,</v>

4360
02:06:02.610 --> 02:06:04.230
<v Speaker 4>they never go in that deep water man.</v>

4361
02:06:04.380 --> 02:06:04.861
<v Speaker 4>They get,</v>

4362
02:06:04.861 --> 02:06:09.480
<v Speaker 4>they go into those shallow kill zones and they elect to have these tight,</v>

4363
02:06:09.660 --> 02:06:13.080
<v Speaker 4>nice short chopping sets where they,</v>

4364
02:06:13.081 --> 02:06:14.250
<v Speaker 4>there's no pause,</v>

4365
02:06:14.370 --> 02:06:14.641
<v Speaker 4>Bam,</v>

4366
02:06:14.641 --> 02:06:14.851
<v Speaker 4>Bam,</v>

4367
02:06:14.851 --> 02:06:15.091
<v Speaker 4>Bam,</v>

4368
02:06:15.091 --> 02:06:15.691
<v Speaker 4>next joke.</v>

4369
02:06:15.691 --> 02:06:16.081
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

4370
02:06:16.081 --> 02:06:17.610
<v Speaker 4>Was that a pause or they not laughing?</v>

4371
02:06:17.670 --> 02:06:18.810
<v Speaker 4>Fuck steel.</v>

4372
02:06:18.960 --> 02:06:21.930
<v Speaker 4>And then they'll jump in with a steel and that's dementia approach.</v>

4373
02:06:22.140 --> 02:06:22.973
<v Speaker 4>That's why when men see,</v>

4374
02:06:22.990 --> 02:06:24.060
<v Speaker 4>would always say he never,</v>

4375
02:06:24.061 --> 02:06:25.200
<v Speaker 4>he never bombed ever.</v>

4376
02:06:25.660 --> 02:06:26.760
<v Speaker 4>Everybody.</v>

4377
02:06:26.820 --> 02:06:27.900
<v Speaker 4>Everybody was like,</v>

4378
02:06:27.901 --> 02:06:28.350
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

4379
02:06:28.350 --> 02:06:29.160
<v Speaker 4>Never.</v>

4380
02:06:29.160 --> 02:06:30.810
<v Speaker 4>You never bombed dude.</v>

4381
02:06:30.811 --> 02:06:34.080
<v Speaker 4>Chappelle bombed a year ago and there's a video of it online.</v>

4382
02:06:34.350 --> 02:06:38.310
<v Speaker 4>He in 22,000 people and if he's not the best comic in the world today,</v>

4383
02:06:38.400 --> 02:06:39.450
<v Speaker 4>he's top three,</v>

4384
02:06:39.600 --> 02:06:40.260
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4385
02:06:40.260 --> 02:06:41.430
<v Speaker 4>I think the best is Joey.</v>

4386
02:06:41.970 --> 02:06:42.960
<v Speaker 4>But Joey's bombed.</v>

4387
02:06:43.170 --> 02:06:43.671
<v Speaker 4>I've seen Joe.</v>

4388
02:06:43.671 --> 02:06:44.670
<v Speaker 4>Joey called me the other day,</v>

4389
02:06:44.671 --> 02:06:45.001
<v Speaker 4>told me,</v>

4390
02:06:45.001 --> 02:06:45.900
<v Speaker 4>bombed in Toledo.</v>

4391
02:06:46.050 --> 02:06:47.280
<v Speaker 4>Those fucking white people,</v>

4392
02:06:47.281 --> 02:06:48.114
<v Speaker 4>Joe Rogan,</v>

4393
02:06:48.180 --> 02:06:50.430
<v Speaker 4>those fucking white people hated me.</v>

4394
02:06:50.700 --> 02:06:51.630
<v Speaker 4>He goes to desk squat.</v>

4395
02:06:51.631 --> 02:06:52.321
<v Speaker 4>People came out,</v>

4396
02:06:52.321 --> 02:06:53.580
<v Speaker 4>but those fucking white people,</v>

4397
02:06:53.730 --> 02:06:54.511
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>

4398
02:06:54.511 --> 02:06:55.344
<v Speaker 4>they hated me.</v>

4399
02:06:55.440 --> 02:06:56.370
<v Speaker 4>He was in Toledo.</v>

4400
02:06:56.730 --> 02:06:57.600
<v Speaker 4>But you see what I'm saying?</v>

4401
02:06:57.601 --> 02:06:58.150
<v Speaker 4>And he's,</v>

4402
02:06:58.150 --> 02:06:58.983
<v Speaker 4>in my opinion,</v>

4403
02:06:59.220 --> 02:07:01.770
<v Speaker 4>I think Joey's the funniest guy I've ever seen in my life.</v>

4404
02:07:01.890 --> 02:07:05.460
<v Speaker 4>I've never seen anybody that makes me laugh as hard as he does and even he can</v>

4405
02:07:05.461 --> 02:07:06.180
<v Speaker 4>still bomb.</v>

4406
02:07:06.180 --> 02:07:08.850
<v Speaker 4>You can just cause he's out there doing it.</v>

4407
02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:10.050
<v Speaker 4>He's got notebooks,</v>

4408
02:07:10.051 --> 02:07:11.880
<v Speaker 4>he's fucking flinging jokes around.</v>

4409
02:07:12.030 --> 02:07:14.670
<v Speaker 4>You have his days where you're on days where you're off.</v>

4410
02:07:15.450 --> 02:07:18.720
<v Speaker 4>That's part of developing and it's constant.</v>

4411
02:07:18.990 --> 02:07:19.860
<v Speaker 4>It keeps going.</v>

4412
02:07:20.280 --> 02:07:22.140
<v Speaker 4>So these guys like these Trevor Noah Katz,</v>

4413
02:07:22.141 --> 02:07:22.974
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

4414
02:07:23.790 --> 02:07:25.050
<v Speaker 4>if that's your tendency,</v>

4415
02:07:25.350 --> 02:07:26.183
<v Speaker 4>you're going to keep what?</v>

4416
02:07:26.240 --> 02:07:28.230
<v Speaker 4>He's going to be very hard for that dude to break.</v>

4417
02:07:28.310 --> 02:07:28.890
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4418
02:07:28.890 --> 02:07:29.723
<v Speaker 4>that's it's getting,</v>

4419
02:07:29.790 --> 02:07:32.820
<v Speaker 4>he might be able to break that tendency because he's famous now.</v>

4420
02:07:32.940 --> 02:07:36.250
<v Speaker 4>He might be able to hire writers and he's smart and he's obviously calculating,</v>

4421
02:07:36.251 --> 02:07:37.630
<v Speaker 4>which is why I put that photo up.</v>

4422
02:07:37.900 --> 02:07:40.180
<v Speaker 4>He didn't put that photo up as a fucking coincidence.</v>

4423
02:07:40.330 --> 02:07:41.140
<v Speaker 4>You think he's like,</v>

4424
02:07:41.140 --> 02:07:41.381
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

4425
02:07:41.381 --> 02:07:42.340
<v Speaker 4>I didn't even know that.</v>

4426
02:07:42.341 --> 02:07:45.790
<v Speaker 4>People were thinking that I stole that bit and please everybody fucking knows.</v>

4427
02:07:46.060 --> 02:07:47.020
<v Speaker 4>Everybody knows.</v>

4428
02:07:47.021 --> 02:07:49.030
<v Speaker 4>He knows that everybody knows and he's made,</v>

4429
02:07:49.060 --> 02:07:51.550
<v Speaker 4>he made a calculated effort to put up at,</v>

4430
02:07:51.551 --> 02:07:53.710
<v Speaker 4>makes me more suspicious of them.</v>

4431
02:07:54.250 --> 02:07:57.040
<v Speaker 4>More suspicious if Dave Chappelle put that picture up,</v>

4432
02:07:57.400 --> 02:07:58.001
<v Speaker 4>I would be like,</v>

4433
02:07:58.001 --> 02:07:58.540
<v Speaker 4>Dave's fuck.</v>

4434
02:07:58.540 --> 02:07:59.170
<v Speaker 4>I would be like,</v>

4435
02:07:59.170 --> 02:08:00.460
<v Speaker 4>what does Dave doing here?</v>

4436
02:08:00.590 --> 02:08:05.590
<v Speaker 4>Is he laughing is as an inside joke but him doing it makes me more suspicious.</v>

4437
02:08:07.060 --> 02:08:08.020
<v Speaker 4>It's hard out there for a pimp.</v>

4438
02:08:08.021 --> 02:08:08.854
<v Speaker 4>Brian Read Ben,</v>

4439
02:08:08.890 --> 02:08:11.350
<v Speaker 4>you know when you going to put together a special</v>

4440
02:08:12.350 --> 02:08:12.831
<v Speaker 2>I need to.</v>

4441
02:08:12.831 --> 02:08:13.700
<v Speaker 2>I just need to do it.</v>

4442
02:08:14.090 --> 02:08:14.441
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4443
02:08:14.441 --> 02:08:15.410
<v Speaker 2>and I have the material.</v>

4444
02:08:15.440 --> 02:08:17.810
<v Speaker 2>I stopped half,</v>

4445
02:08:17.810 --> 02:08:19.310
<v Speaker 2>like half hour's worth of material recently.</v>

4446
02:08:19.640 --> 02:08:20.473
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean he stopped?</v>

4447
02:08:20.480 --> 02:08:21.410
<v Speaker 2>I just stopped doing it.</v>

4448
02:08:21.580 --> 02:08:22.640
<v Speaker 2>But you have it written down.</v>

4449
02:08:22.760 --> 02:08:22.971
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4450
02:08:22.971 --> 02:08:23.181
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4451
02:08:23.181 --> 02:08:26.990
<v Speaker 2>I have it recorded and it's on video.</v>

4452
02:08:27.100 --> 02:08:28.370
<v Speaker 2>You should totally put something out.</v>

4453
02:08:29.030 --> 02:08:29.863
<v Speaker 2>Put something out.</v>

4454
02:08:30.230 --> 02:08:32.300
<v Speaker 2>Some guy just advertise the other day on Twitter,</v>

4455
02:08:32.301 --> 02:08:34.550
<v Speaker 2>like $1,500 four camera shoot.</v>

4456
02:08:34.551 --> 02:08:36.640
<v Speaker 2>We'll make your comedy special or something like that.</v>

4457
02:08:36.670 --> 02:08:36.860
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4458
02:08:36.860 --> 02:08:37.693
<v Speaker 2>100 bucks like,</v>

4459
02:08:37.770 --> 02:08:37.980
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

4460
02:08:37.980 --> 02:08:39.200
<v Speaker 2>I should just do that for fun.</v>

4461
02:08:39.650 --> 02:08:40.610
<v Speaker 2>Does he know what he's doing?</v>

4462
02:08:40.790 --> 02:08:41.241
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

4463
02:08:41.241 --> 02:08:41.691
<v Speaker 2>Probably.</v>

4464
02:08:41.691 --> 02:08:43.160
<v Speaker 2>It's so easy nowadays.</v>

4465
02:08:43.460 --> 02:08:43.850
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4466
02:08:43.850 --> 02:08:46.550
<v Speaker 2>I may remember when I used to go on the road with you all the time,</v>

4467
02:08:46.551 --> 02:08:47.900
<v Speaker 2>I would bring three cameras,</v>

4468
02:08:47.901 --> 02:08:48.860
<v Speaker 2>have a front back,</v>

4469
02:08:48.861 --> 02:08:49.641
<v Speaker 2>two sides.</v>

4470
02:08:49.641 --> 02:08:50.290
<v Speaker 2>And that was,</v>

4471
02:08:50.290 --> 02:08:52.400
<v Speaker 2>those were shitty little old school cameras.</v>

4472
02:08:52.401 --> 02:08:54.230
<v Speaker 2>Two in comparison to what's available today.</v>

4473
02:08:54.260 --> 02:08:54.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4474
02:08:54.830 --> 02:08:57.500
<v Speaker 2>But we were on kind of on top of the game on all the cameras.</v>

4475
02:08:57.501 --> 02:09:00.720
<v Speaker 2>You would always upgrade them to like the best Sony Cams.</v>

4476
02:09:01.930 --> 02:09:02.541
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>

4477
02:09:02.541 --> 02:09:03.051
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

4478
02:09:03.051 --> 02:09:03.860
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4479
02:09:03.860 --> 02:09:05.330
<v Speaker 4>my next one that I'm going to do,</v>

4480
02:09:05.630 --> 02:09:07.880
<v Speaker 4>which I'm going to probably do within the next six months,</v>

4481
02:09:08.180 --> 02:09:09.770
<v Speaker 4>I'm working out all the details right now.</v>

4482
02:09:10.010 --> 02:09:11.390
<v Speaker 4>I think I'm going to do it at the Ice House.</v>

4483
02:09:11.830 --> 02:09:13.490
<v Speaker 4>I'm at the Ice House on October 30th,</v>

4484
02:09:13.491 --> 02:09:13.641
<v Speaker 4>too,</v>

4485
02:09:13.641 --> 02:09:14.360
<v Speaker 4>by the way.</v>

4486
02:09:14.360 --> 02:09:15.193
<v Speaker 4>Me and Ian.</v>

4487
02:09:15.280 --> 02:09:15.660
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4488
02:09:15.660 --> 02:09:18.110
<v Speaker 4>and maybe Diaz might stop by for the 10 o'clock show,</v>

4489
02:09:18.230 --> 02:09:18.920
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

4490
02:09:18.920 --> 02:09:19.753
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4491
02:09:20.930 --> 02:09:21.650
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

4492
02:09:21.650 --> 02:09:22.131
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

4493
02:09:22.131 --> 02:09:22.430
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4494
02:09:22.430 --> 02:09:23.241
<v Speaker 4>that's the future.</v>

4495
02:09:23.241 --> 02:09:26.390
<v Speaker 4>I think the future is just doing it old school at a club and you know,</v>

4496
02:09:26.391 --> 02:09:30.260
<v Speaker 4>having the production value be in the quality of the video itself so that it</v>

4497
02:09:30.261 --> 02:09:32.840
<v Speaker 4>captures the room as accurately as possible.</v>

4498
02:09:33.020 --> 02:09:36.740
<v Speaker 4>But don't try to make it like this big swooping camera and all that bullshit.</v>

4499
02:09:36.741 --> 02:09:38.750
<v Speaker 4>I want people to feel like they're sitting down in the crowd.</v>

4500
02:09:39.060 --> 02:09:41.600
<v Speaker 4>And I think the only way to do that is to put it in a small spot.</v>

4501
02:09:42.220 --> 02:09:42.950
<v Speaker 4>Cause uh,</v>

4502
02:09:42.950 --> 02:09:43.783
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4503
02:09:43.790 --> 02:09:45.140
<v Speaker 4>I'll do big shows,</v>

4504
02:09:45.320 --> 02:09:47.180
<v Speaker 4>I'll do these big shows and they're fun.</v>

4505
02:09:47.181 --> 02:09:48.380
<v Speaker 4>Man Theaters are fun.</v>

4506
02:09:48.530 --> 02:09:49.970
<v Speaker 4>It's a different kind of experience.</v>

4507
02:09:50.300 --> 02:09:51.041
<v Speaker 4>But the,</v>

4508
02:09:51.041 --> 02:09:51.861
<v Speaker 4>the real show,</v>

4509
02:09:51.861 --> 02:09:53.450
<v Speaker 4>we all know the real,</v>

4510
02:09:53.470 --> 02:09:57.710
<v Speaker 4>the really fun show that's going to translate into sitting at home and watching</v>

4511
02:09:57.711 --> 02:09:59.270
<v Speaker 4>it is like 200 at a comedy club,</v>

4512
02:09:59.290 --> 02:10:00.190
<v Speaker 2>especially Ice House.</v>

4513
02:10:00.220 --> 02:10:01.360
<v Speaker 2>I love the Ice House so much.</v>

4514
02:10:01.361 --> 02:10:01.661
<v Speaker 2>I had some,</v>

4515
02:10:01.661 --> 02:10:03.040
<v Speaker 2>one of my favorite sets Friday,</v>

4516
02:10:03.041 --> 02:10:07.510
<v Speaker 2>just do stuff and just positive people go their staff,</v>

4517
02:10:07.550 --> 02:10:08.860
<v Speaker 2>everything's awesome man.</v>

4518
02:10:09.250 --> 02:10:10.880
<v Speaker 2>Well it's got 65 fucking</v>

4519
02:10:10.880 --> 02:10:13.220
<v Speaker 4>years of comedy burned into the walls too,</v>

4520
02:10:13.310 --> 02:10:14.143
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

4521
02:10:14.240 --> 02:10:17.270
<v Speaker 4>And also I think I learned something from doing that.</v>

4522
02:10:17.271 --> 02:10:18.350
<v Speaker 4>A comedy central special,</v>

4523
02:10:18.351 --> 02:10:19.280
<v Speaker 4>the rocky mountain high.</v>

4524
02:10:19.640 --> 02:10:19.881
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

4525
02:10:19.881 --> 02:10:20.714
<v Speaker 4>that's the way to do it.</v>

4526
02:10:20.840 --> 02:10:24.740
<v Speaker 4>That felt more to me like a regular set than anything else I've ever done.</v>

4527
02:10:24.920 --> 02:10:26.000
<v Speaker 4>You could see the audience,</v>

4528
02:10:26.001 --> 02:10:27.320
<v Speaker 4>the right there on top of me,</v>

4529
02:10:27.530 --> 02:10:28.070
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4530
02:10:28.070 --> 02:10:28.790
<v Speaker 4>it was fun.</v>

4531
02:10:28.790 --> 02:10:29.623
<v Speaker 4>That's the way to do it.</v>

4532
02:10:30.080 --> 02:10:31.460
<v Speaker 4>And the ice house is even better than that.</v>

4533
02:10:31.461 --> 02:10:32.630
<v Speaker 4>Ice Houses our home too,</v>

4534
02:10:32.631 --> 02:10:32.811
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4535
02:10:32.811 --> 02:10:33.860
<v Speaker 4>that's home base.</v>

4536
02:10:34.220 --> 02:10:36.920
<v Speaker 3>Other than the comedy store that that place feels like home to me.</v>

4537
02:10:37.550 --> 02:10:38.600
<v Speaker 3>Even I do the factory,</v>

4538
02:10:38.601 --> 02:10:39.530
<v Speaker 3>I've done the laugh factory.</v>

4539
02:10:39.920 --> 02:10:42.740
<v Speaker 3>Who knows how many times over decades still always feels weird.</v>

4540
02:10:42.850 --> 02:10:43.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah man,</v>

4541
02:10:44.680 --> 02:10:45.950
<v Speaker 3>the Improv is pretty cool,</v>

4542
02:10:45.951 --> 02:10:46.760
<v Speaker 3>but that's not,</v>

4543
02:10:46.760 --> 02:10:47.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4544
02:10:47.120 --> 02:10:47.953
<v Speaker 3>it's not the same.</v>

4545
02:10:48.230 --> 02:10:50.660
<v Speaker 3>The Ice House to me is like right up there with the store.</v>

4546
02:10:50.990 --> 02:10:51.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4547
02:10:51.560 --> 02:10:52.140
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

4548
02:10:52.140 --> 02:10:52.973
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4549
02:10:54.620 --> 02:10:54.860
<v Speaker 3>Damn.</v>

4550
02:10:54.860 --> 02:10:59.510
<v Speaker 3>Germany orders recalled 8.5 million Volkswagens said they recall yours.</v>

4551
02:10:59.780 --> 02:11:00.740
<v Speaker 3>I don't have that anymore.</v>

4552
02:11:00.830 --> 02:11:01.301
<v Speaker 3>I got rid of it.</v>

4553
02:11:01.301 --> 02:11:02.134
<v Speaker 3>You got rid of it?</v>

4554
02:11:02.270 --> 02:11:03.103
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4555
02:11:03.110 --> 02:11:03.651
<v Speaker 3>they uh,</v>

4556
02:11:03.651 --> 02:11:04.371
<v Speaker 3>they fucked up.</v>

4557
02:11:04.371 --> 02:11:05.210
<v Speaker 3>They tried to lie.</v>

4558
02:11:05.810 --> 02:11:07.550
<v Speaker 3>I think I figured out what car when want get though.</v>

4559
02:11:08.210 --> 02:11:09.950
<v Speaker 3>I three that BMW I,</v>

4560
02:11:09.980 --> 02:11:10.700
<v Speaker 3>those are dope.</v>

4561
02:11:10.700 --> 02:11:12.510
<v Speaker 3>They look like an iPhone on wheels.</v>

4562
02:11:12.810 --> 02:11:13.640
<v Speaker 3>It looks cool.</v>

4563
02:11:13.640 --> 02:11:13.881
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4564
02:11:13.881 --> 02:11:14.714
<v Speaker 3>Those are pretty dope.</v>

4565
02:11:14.750 --> 02:11:18.380
<v Speaker 3>I think my way to get a used one kind of expensive.</v>

4566
02:11:18.420 --> 02:11:18.540
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

4567
02:11:18.540 --> 02:11:19.373
<v Speaker 3>are they?</v>

4568
02:11:19.520 --> 02:11:21.230
<v Speaker 3>I heard those things break down a lot though.</v>

4569
02:11:21.230 --> 02:11:22.070
<v Speaker 3>Is that it right there?</v>

4570
02:11:22.960 --> 02:11:24.770
<v Speaker 3>That's the video that autopilot from Tesla.</v>

4571
02:11:24.830 --> 02:11:25.730
<v Speaker 3>Oh Jesus.</v>

4572
02:11:25.731 --> 02:11:26.211
<v Speaker 3>Play this.</v>

4573
02:11:26.211 --> 02:11:28.640
<v Speaker 3>So this is something we've got to leave on this cause I gotta get Outta here.</v>

4574
02:11:28.790 --> 02:11:30.680
<v Speaker 3>So this is some update.</v>

4575
02:11:30.770 --> 02:11:32.930
<v Speaker 3>Jamie when she explained the update because Tesla,</v>

4576
02:11:32.990 --> 02:11:34.160
<v Speaker 3>they did an over the air update,</v>

4577
02:11:34.161 --> 02:11:35.990
<v Speaker 3>which is something that I didn't know that they could do,</v>

4578
02:11:35.991 --> 02:11:38.630
<v Speaker 3>but they said they're going to do it multiple times and I think it's just in</v>

4579
02:11:38.631 --> 02:11:39.500
<v Speaker 3>Beta right now.</v>

4580
02:11:39.810 --> 02:11:40.460
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4581
02:11:40.460 --> 02:11:44.480
<v Speaker 3>so Tesla has an auto pilot and also an auto park.</v>

4582
02:11:45.280 --> 02:11:47.870
<v Speaker 3>The autopilot think it's just made for the freeway right now,</v>

4583
02:11:47.900 --> 02:11:51.140
<v Speaker 3>but they've been testing it and there's some videos showing it used in,</v>

4584
02:11:51.170 --> 02:11:51.650
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4585
02:11:51.650 --> 02:11:53.510
<v Speaker 3>like in New York on 12th Avenue.</v>

4586
02:11:53.810 --> 02:11:54.321
<v Speaker 3>And this is,</v>

4587
02:11:54.321 --> 02:11:58.790
<v Speaker 3>I think this looks like it's back on like a movie lot and they're showing the,</v>

4588
02:11:58.791 --> 02:11:59.420
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4589
02:11:59.420 --> 02:11:59.840
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

4590
02:11:59.840 --> 02:12:01.190
<v Speaker 3>that crazy button first.</v>

4591
02:12:01.220 --> 02:12:05.180
<v Speaker 3>So it shoots up to 75 miles an hour and then it's going to go into autopilot</v>

4592
02:12:05.181 --> 02:12:08.510
<v Speaker 3>mode and you see it like a read street signs and it's reading the white lines on</v>

4593
02:12:08.511 --> 02:12:09.220
<v Speaker 3>the road.</v>

4594
02:12:09.220 --> 02:12:13.520
<v Speaker 3>She kind of moved her car and then at the very end it will stop it as it sees a</v>

4595
02:12:13.521 --> 02:12:14.510
<v Speaker 3>car in front of it too.</v>

4596
02:12:15.890 --> 02:12:16.470
<v Speaker 3>I hope this,</v>

4597
02:12:16.470 --> 02:12:17.900
<v Speaker 3>this is video from slash gear,</v>

4598
02:12:17.901 --> 02:12:18.411
<v Speaker 3>so this was,</v>

4599
02:12:18.411 --> 02:12:19.970
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't bother us too much,</v>

4600
02:12:19.971 --> 02:12:21.200
<v Speaker 3>but wow.</v>

4601
02:12:23.480 --> 02:12:24.440
<v Speaker 3>Just full door.</v>

4602
02:12:24.680 --> 02:12:26.850
<v Speaker 3>Sit down and we started over to there.</v>

4603
02:12:27.530 --> 02:12:28.820
<v Speaker 3>They're getting ready to launch right now.</v>

4604
02:12:32.650 --> 02:12:33.483
<v Speaker 10>So</v>

4605
02:12:36.090 --> 02:12:38.070
<v Speaker 10>just look at that fucking screen.</v>

4606
02:12:38.580 --> 02:12:40.080
<v Speaker 10>This is on autopilot right now.</v>

4607
02:12:40.610 --> 02:12:40.880
<v Speaker 10>Yeah,</v>

4608
02:12:40.880 --> 02:12:41.713
<v Speaker 10>that's fast.</v>

4609
02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:42.441
<v Speaker 10>Trust.</v>

4610
02:12:42.441 --> 02:12:43.274
<v Speaker 10>Just follow.</v>

4611
02:12:43.470 --> 02:12:44.281
<v Speaker 3>Sit down in the world.</v>

4612
02:12:44.281 --> 02:12:45.550
<v Speaker 3>You say never.</v>

4613
02:12:46.140 --> 02:12:47.300
<v Speaker 10>This is not driving itself.</v>

4614
02:12:47.301 --> 02:12:50.940
<v Speaker 10>I mean you can't as can turn on the autopilot system.</v>

4615
02:12:51.750 --> 02:12:52.583
<v Speaker 10>Engaging it now.</v>

4616
02:12:53.220 --> 02:12:54.053
<v Speaker 10>Wow.</v>

4617
02:12:54.500 --> 02:12:55.450
<v Speaker 10>Queriness so cool.</v>

4618
02:12:55.750 --> 02:12:56.820
<v Speaker 10>The accelerator,</v>

4619
02:12:57.420 --> 02:13:00.930
<v Speaker 10>the car will observe the 30 mile an hour sign and increase in speed.</v>

4620
02:13:00.990 --> 02:13:02.340
<v Speaker 10>As we go through this bend.</v>

4621
02:13:03.450 --> 02:13:08.450
<v Speaker 10>I'd be texting like a motherfucker right now on the road and as it observes this</v>

4622
02:13:08.491 --> 02:13:10.020
<v Speaker 10>25 mile an hour speed,</v>

4623
02:13:10.530 --> 02:13:15.120
<v Speaker 10>it's going to reduce Jesus Christ and it click the turn signal on where people</v>

4624
02:13:15.121 --> 02:13:17.460
<v Speaker 10>are going to fuck around and put 90 on those things.</v>

4625
02:13:17.730 --> 02:13:19.710
<v Speaker 10>Just taping it and now the nine,</v>

4626
02:13:19.711 --> 02:13:21.360
<v Speaker 10>the car over the too nice.</v>

4627
02:13:21.380 --> 02:13:22.230
<v Speaker 10>So many problems.</v>

4628
02:13:22.231 --> 02:13:23.430
<v Speaker 10>I can see just with like,</v>

4629
02:13:23.690 --> 02:13:24.480
<v Speaker 10>but I'm sure they've thought</v>

4630
02:13:24.480 --> 02:13:26.400
<v Speaker 3>there are a lot of things but wow,</v>

4631
02:13:27.630 --> 02:13:28.440
<v Speaker 3>that's so,</v>

4632
02:13:28.440 --> 02:13:30.230
<v Speaker 10>oh that's amazing.</v>

4633
02:13:32.460 --> 02:13:32.980
<v Speaker 1>This guy,</v>

4634
02:13:32.980 --> 02:13:37.290
<v Speaker 1>Elon Musk is freaking me out because it makes me feel really stupid,</v>

4635
02:13:37.770 --> 02:13:41.970
<v Speaker 1>really stupid and really unambitious and really insignificant.</v>

4636
02:13:42.120 --> 02:13:44.730
<v Speaker 1>When I see him with his beautifully tailored suits and he's talking about</v>

4637
02:13:44.731 --> 02:13:45.451
<v Speaker 1>changing the world.</v>

4638
02:13:45.451 --> 02:13:45.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

4639
02:13:45.810 --> 02:13:47.580
<v Speaker 1>am I looking at Tony Stark for real?</v>

4640
02:13:47.850 --> 02:13:48.450
<v Speaker 1>This is like,</v>

4641
02:13:48.450 --> 02:13:50.130
<v Speaker 1>when is he going to come out with an iron man suit?</v>

4642
02:13:50.270 --> 02:13:50.640
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4643
02:13:50.640 --> 02:13:52.950
<v Speaker 1>Cause he's gonna you know that fucks got one already.</v>

4644
02:13:53.430 --> 02:13:54.840
<v Speaker 1>He's probably gotten one already in his basement.</v>

4645
02:13:54.841 --> 02:13:55.710
<v Speaker 1>He's probably all Adderall.</v>

4646
02:13:55.720 --> 02:13:57.300
<v Speaker 1>Dot Steve Jobs too.</v>

4647
02:13:57.301 --> 02:13:57.710
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

4648
02:13:57.710 --> 02:13:59.730
<v Speaker 1>Like he's more than to see jobs to me.</v>

4649
02:13:59.810 --> 02:14:00.211
<v Speaker 1>Write to me,</v>

4650
02:14:00.211 --> 02:14:02.760
<v Speaker 1>he's way more innovative because what Steve Jobs did was amazing,</v>

4651
02:14:02.761 --> 02:14:04.350
<v Speaker 1>but it was all in the world of computing,</v>

4652
02:14:04.560 --> 02:14:07.950
<v Speaker 1>which is arguably the reason why this guy is able to do this in the first place</v>

4653
02:14:08.250 --> 02:14:11.460
<v Speaker 1>is because he's incredibly powerful computers and the access to them and</v>

4654
02:14:11.700 --> 02:14:15.390
<v Speaker 1>changing the way people use the Internet is probably what started this all off</v>

4655
02:14:15.391 --> 02:14:16.020
<v Speaker 1>in the first place.</v>

4656
02:14:16.020 --> 02:14:20.150
<v Speaker 1>But what he's doing between this and the bullet trains like keys.</v>

4657
02:14:20.180 --> 02:14:24.570
<v Speaker 1>He's going to create these magnetic trains that can go across the country in a</v>

4658
02:14:24.571 --> 02:14:26.310
<v Speaker 1>fraction of the time it takes to fly.</v>

4659
02:14:26.370 --> 02:14:27.830
<v Speaker 1>What kind of plan do you think he flies in?</v>

4660
02:14:27.840 --> 02:14:28.531
<v Speaker 1>Something crazy.</v>

4661
02:14:28.531 --> 02:14:29.010
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

4662
02:14:29.010 --> 02:14:30.390
<v Speaker 1>Stealth bomber type shit.</v>

4663
02:14:30.590 --> 02:14:31.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4664
02:14:31.200 --> 02:14:31.771
<v Speaker 1>Who knows,</v>

4665
02:14:31.771 --> 02:14:32.041
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4666
02:14:32.041 --> 02:14:33.630
<v Speaker 1>He's probably got some ridiculous jet.</v>

4673
02:14:41.490 --> 02:14:43.800
<v Speaker 1>Says phones and computers that we haven't seen yet.</v>

4674
02:14:44.010 --> 02:14:44.191
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>With no chem trails.</v>

4676
02:14:45.420 --> 02:14:46.920
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't even make chem trails.</v>

4677
