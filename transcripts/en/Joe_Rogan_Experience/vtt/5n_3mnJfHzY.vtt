1
00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:06.170
<v Speaker 1>I liked the art bill buildup because so</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody likes the art bell buildup,</v>

2
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.430
<v Speaker 1>the art bell sound,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what did,</v>

3
00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.570
<v Speaker 1>what did he say from the Kingdom of Nih</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Nih?</v>

4
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:15.240
<v Speaker 1>PAHRUMP,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nevada.</v>

5
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.450
<v Speaker 1>I used to always love our bell because</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone would call in and say,</v>

6
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm aware wolf,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and here we go.</v>

7
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.980
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my interesting.</v>

00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:24.810
<v Speaker 1>Tell me more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't care.</v>

9
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.060
<v Speaker 1>He never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He never called you out on it.</v>

10
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.220
<v Speaker 1>Just let you let you ramble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hit time.</v>

11
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.320
<v Speaker 1>Traveler lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Loved the people.</v>

12
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.150
<v Speaker 1>Loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never learned anything from it though.</v>

13
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.330
<v Speaker 1>So you're obsessed with Ufo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

14
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.900
<v Speaker 1>Is that safe to say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's safe to say,</v>

15
00:00:39.901 --> 00:00:43.350
<v Speaker 1>but it's not so much just the Ufo at its</v>
<v Speaker 1>self.</v>

16
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't call them that anymore,</v>

17
00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.130
<v Speaker 1>that we call these advanced aerial</v>
<v Speaker 1>threats.</v>

18
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.090
<v Speaker 1>There are different threats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were honed in our word.</v>

19
00:00:51.091 --> 00:00:53.970
<v Speaker 1>We weren't supposed to really get into</v>
<v Speaker 1>here in the first part of the show.</v>

20
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.110
<v Speaker 1>Did you have a plan?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a very.</v>

21
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.710
<v Speaker 1>I have a very long plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Detailed plan.</v>

22
00:00:58.711 --> 00:01:01.050
<v Speaker 1>We're going to start with my body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're just going to talk about my body</v>

23
00:01:01.051 --> 00:01:02.640
<v Speaker 1>for a lot and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

24
00:01:02.641 --> 00:01:04.320
<v Speaker 1>What do you want to talk about in terms</v>
<v Speaker 1>of your body?</v>

25
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.540
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my body is interesting.</v>

26
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.570
<v Speaker 1>It's unique.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It changes shape and what I've noticed</v>

27
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.240
<v Speaker 1>is it's just changing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's getting larger and larger,</v>

28
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.950
<v Speaker 1>getting wider pending upon what you put</v>
<v Speaker 1>in it.</v>

29
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.570
<v Speaker 1>But you're off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can I cuss?</v>

<v Speaker 1>You shook my hand.</v>

33
00:01:22.261 --> 00:01:24.060
<v Speaker 1>I think it would break my hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

34
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just don't be strong.</v>

35
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.160
<v Speaker 1>I didn't mean to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't be.</v>

36
00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.490
<v Speaker 1>You're shaking your hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just thought it was a handshake.</v>

37
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:30.670
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

38
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.150
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those power moves you ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>see when trump shakes people's hands and</v>

39
00:01:33.151 --> 00:01:34.550
<v Speaker 1>he pulls them in and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

40
00:01:34.551 --> 00:01:35.460
<v Speaker 1>he does do weird shit.</v>

41
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.690
<v Speaker 1>Does weird shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

42
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't mean to do that.</v>

43
00:01:37.981 --> 00:01:39.240
<v Speaker 1>It just meant to shake your hand like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

44
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.193
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.260
<v Speaker 1>I took it as like know your place</v>
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker.</v>

46
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.480
<v Speaker 1>Oh this is my show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think that.</v>

47
00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.921
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just joking.</v>

48
00:01:46.921 --> 00:01:48.330
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

49
00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.970
<v Speaker 1>so how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when did you get obsessed with this</v>

50
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.600
<v Speaker 1>aerial threat thing and why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you,</v>

51
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.470
<v Speaker 1>why do you call them threats?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

52
00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.150
<v Speaker 1>we'll get into that I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

53
00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.053
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

54
00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got into when I was in junior high,</v>

55
00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.730
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for some weird reason I had like some</v>

56
00:02:02.731 --> 00:02:04.150
<v Speaker 1>time off in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

57
00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.410
<v Speaker 1>and I went to the school library and</v>
<v Speaker 1>like seventh grade and I was like,</v>

58
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.300
<v Speaker 1>damn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gotta read some Boring Shit,</v>

59
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.240
<v Speaker 1>what am I going to read?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I saw this one book and it had a</v>

60
00:02:12.241 --> 00:02:14.070
<v Speaker 1>picture of the lochness monster and like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

61
00:02:14.071 --> 00:02:15.510
<v Speaker 1>you have almost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that looks cool.</v>

62
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.550
<v Speaker 1>And I read that and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>holy cow,</v>

63
00:02:17.551 --> 00:02:20.610
<v Speaker 1>these are like real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't all science fiction.</v>

64
00:02:20.611 --> 00:02:23.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean the way the book was laid out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like these are like real event and</v>

65
00:02:23.191 --> 00:02:23.970
<v Speaker 1>so I'm all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no,</v>

66
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.500
<v Speaker 1>no way really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

67
00:02:25.501 --> 00:02:27.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the band started doing it,</v>

68
00:02:27.501 --> 00:02:29.910
<v Speaker 1>staying in the back of the van,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were no smartphones.</v>

69
00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.320
<v Speaker 1>So as we were buying books and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I would just lay there,</v>

70
00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.290
<v Speaker 1>we'd have like 20 hour drives and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I started buying books on the Ufo</v>

71
00:02:37.291 --> 00:02:39.840
<v Speaker 1>phenomenon and I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>want you to do that.</v>

72
00:02:39.841 --> 00:02:40.770
<v Speaker 1>It's a black hole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're done.</v>

73
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely a rabbit hole.</v>

74
00:02:42.541 --> 00:02:44.170
<v Speaker 1>You get sucked into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

75
00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my house,</v>

76
00:02:45.451 --> 00:02:50.451
<v Speaker 1>I have a frame poster that's the cover</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the Roswell Daily News shows the day</v>

77
00:02:51.181 --> 00:02:55.800
<v Speaker 1>after the Roswell crash where it says</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the air force came and recovered</v>

78
00:02:55.801 --> 00:02:57.300
<v Speaker 1>the wreckage and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

79
00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.130
<v Speaker 1>the whole deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been obsessed with this shit.</v>

80
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:00.130
<v Speaker 1>I was a little kid.</v>

81
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

82
00:03:01.071 --> 00:03:03.560
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a,</v>

83
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.530
<v Speaker 2>I think that's by design.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that this generation is a,</v>

84
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.420
<v Speaker 2>was meant to have this stuff come out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

85
00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:12.640
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

86
00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.140
<v Speaker 2>I can't prove that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just my feeling.</v>

87
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.570
<v Speaker 2>What would it makes you feel that like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

88
00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.390
<v Speaker 2>because of exactly what you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a lot of people.</v>

89
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.340
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe that some of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

90
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe that some of the events</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened on accident.</v>

91
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:27.910
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>

92
00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.100
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's been a lot of events that are on</v>

93
00:03:30.101 --> 00:03:31.660
<v Speaker 2>purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some have been for show,</v>

94
00:03:31.661 --> 00:03:33.880
<v Speaker 2>some have been for um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>human,</v>

95
00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:35.620
<v Speaker 2>there's a variety of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a variety of reasons,</v>

96
00:03:35.621 --> 00:03:40.621
<v Speaker 2>but I think a lot of it is a control</v>
<v Speaker 2>system that's really pushing humanity in</v>

97
00:03:41.141 --> 00:03:43.080
<v Speaker 2>a very specific direction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

98
00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.170
<v Speaker 2>so like they've got a timeframe where</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had these events take place.</v>

99
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:48.220
<v Speaker 2>Is that what you think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

100
00:03:48.221 --> 00:03:51.130
<v Speaker 2>And they also time travel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is different than what people</v>

101
00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.590
<v Speaker 2>think in like a movie where they sit in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a machine and you often,</v>

102
00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.900
<v Speaker 2>you're in the 19 thirties and you got to</v>
<v Speaker 2>go save humanity.</v>

103
00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.120
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you use the technology,</v>

104
00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.530
<v Speaker 2>you have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a time a difference between</v>

105
00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.680
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they're doing inside of an article</v>

106
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.950
<v Speaker 2>artificially created bubble of gravity</v>
<v Speaker 2>of sorts.</v>

107
00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:12.010
<v Speaker 2>And then what's on the outside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you're on the inside of one of</v>

108
00:04:12.011 --> 00:04:15.460
<v Speaker 2>those machines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything would be skewed more black</v>

109
00:04:15.461 --> 00:04:17.830
<v Speaker 2>and white.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There'd be like a red shift and</v>

110
00:04:17.831 --> 00:04:21.760
<v Speaker 2>everybody would look frozen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you literally could fly around and</v>

111
00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:24.130
<v Speaker 2>grab a coke out of someone's hand and</v>
<v Speaker 2>put it in someone else's hand.</v>

112
00:04:24.131 --> 00:04:25.870
<v Speaker 2>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where are you getting this from?</v>

113
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.500
<v Speaker 2>Will take a wild guess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at the people I'm surrounded by,</v>

114
00:04:29.501 --> 00:04:30.334
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

115
00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.410
<v Speaker 2>so the people you're surrounded by are</v>
<v Speaker 2>telling you this is what it is a well,</v>

116
00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to get into that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the people I'm surrounded with,</v>

117
00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.110
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and myself,</v>

118
00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.130
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

119
00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:43.720
<v Speaker 2>are very close to this stuff.</v>

120
00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.100
<v Speaker 2>But the physics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

121
00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.250
<v Speaker 2>the physicist that's a Co founder of my</v>
<v Speaker 2>company to the star,</v>

122
00:04:48.251 --> 00:04:51.010
<v Speaker 2>he's a Nobel nominee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wrote the book on Plasma Physics.</v>

123
00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:52.390
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's his name?</v>

124
00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.670
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hal put off Dr Hal put off and he,</v>

125
00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:57.820
<v Speaker 2>he created remote viewing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what remote viewing is?</v>

126
00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.180
<v Speaker 2>He's the creator of the CIA psychics spy</v>
<v Speaker 2>program.</v>

127
00:05:01.181 --> 00:05:06.181
<v Speaker 2>But he also has done like really exotic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>advanced forefront propulsion work for</v>

128
00:05:07.541 --> 00:05:11.260
<v Speaker 2>the past decades and decades actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

129
00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.350
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's deep into like quantum,</v>

130
00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.040
<v Speaker 2>this and that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's the one that actually told me</v>

131
00:05:18.041 --> 00:05:19.090
<v Speaker 2>about the red shift.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

132
00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:24.570
<v Speaker 2>And so they have experienced this</v>
<v Speaker 2>physically or is this just theoretical</v>

133
00:05:25.571 --> 00:05:28.390
<v Speaker 2>or they know that it exists?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the technology?</v>

134
00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:29.880
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

135
00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:34.420
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that the technology,</v>

136
00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.700
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only exists,</v>

137
00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.870
<v Speaker 2>we've figured out how to play with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not going to really get into</v>

138
00:05:40.871 --> 00:05:41.470
<v Speaker 2>that here.</v>

139
00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:43.630
<v Speaker 2>I what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what that is what we're doing at my</v>

140
00:05:43.631 --> 00:05:45.310
<v Speaker 2>company though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is the announcement.</v>

141
00:05:45.311 --> 00:05:49.300
<v Speaker 2>So Steve Justice was head of advanced</v>
<v Speaker 2>programs that the skunk works and the</v>

142
00:05:49.301 --> 00:05:51.640
<v Speaker 2>skunkworks or who built,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

143
00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.640
<v Speaker 2>the famous secret basis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you hear about skunk works,</v>

144
00:05:54.641 --> 00:05:57.530
<v Speaker 2>did you know the u two spy plane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the SR seven one blackbird,</v>

145
00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:01.730
<v Speaker 2>1:17 style fighter and it's all groom</v>
<v Speaker 2>lake out there,</v>

146
00:06:01.731 --> 00:06:04.070
<v Speaker 2>all that kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

147
00:06:04.071 --> 00:06:06.440
<v Speaker 2>and he literally was in charge of all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the advanced program.</v>

148
00:06:06.441 --> 00:06:07.161
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

149
00:06:07.161 --> 00:06:10.810
<v Speaker 2>you've got the boss and you got him and</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

150
00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:12.410
<v Speaker 2>he came,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

151
00:06:12.411 --> 00:06:16.190
<v Speaker 2>he just finished his career over there</v>
<v Speaker 2>within the past two months.</v>

152
00:06:16.191 --> 00:06:19.370
<v Speaker 2>I think it is an.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was on stage with me when we came</v>

153
00:06:19.371 --> 00:06:21.530
<v Speaker 2>out and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to be building one of these</v>

154
00:06:21.531 --> 00:06:23.530
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when,</v>

155
00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:24.680
<v Speaker 2>when you save it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

156
00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:29.630
<v Speaker 2>all this technology exists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have they explained this to you or have</v>

157
00:06:29.631 --> 00:06:30.770
<v Speaker 2>you seen it physically?</v>

158
00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.200
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen anything physically like</v>

159
00:06:33.201 --> 00:06:33.800
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

160
00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.250
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't be allowed to go anywhere if</v>
<v Speaker 2>that does or doesn't exist.</v>

161
00:06:37.251 --> 00:06:41.750
<v Speaker 2>So they've just explained to you that</v>
<v Speaker 2>this exists and that this is in the</v>

162
00:06:41.751 --> 00:06:44.390
<v Speaker 2>hands of the US government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This I think.</v>

163
00:06:44.391 --> 00:06:44.871
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

164
00:06:44.871 --> 00:06:46.160
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to get into that kind of</v>

165
00:06:46.161 --> 00:06:46.994
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

166
00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.790
<v Speaker 2>if you don't mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well why is it that you want to not get</v>

167
00:06:49.791 --> 00:06:50.690
<v Speaker 2>into certain things?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

168
00:06:50.691 --> 00:06:52.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to speak act,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

169
00:06:52.251 --> 00:06:54.710
<v Speaker 2>I represent more than myself these days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

170
00:06:54.711 --> 00:06:56.390
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I definitely have to watch what I say.</v>

171
00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:59.300
<v Speaker 2>Who Do you represent when you say</v>
<v Speaker 2>represent more than yourself?</v>

172
00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:02.120
<v Speaker 2>The team that I'm with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you look at the people that are</v>

173
00:07:02.121 --> 00:07:05.180
<v Speaker 2>a part of my company,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's under secretary of defense's and</v>

174
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:09.010
<v Speaker 2>defense and senior intelligence service.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there a list of these people like</v>

175
00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:09.680
<v Speaker 2>that we could see?</v>

176
00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.810
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought you guys would have had that</v>

177
00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.530
<v Speaker 2>list where folks could see it online.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

178
00:07:15.531 --> 00:07:17.060
<v Speaker 2>they can go to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

179
00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:21.680
<v Speaker 2>to the Stars Academy Dot Com.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scroll down and you'll be able to see</v>

180
00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:22.970
<v Speaker 2>who they all are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

181
00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:25.190
<v Speaker 2>so how did you get linked up with all</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people?</v>

182
00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:29.270
<v Speaker 2>That story might be a better way to</v>
<v Speaker 2>start because a lot of people don't know</v>

183
00:07:29.271 --> 00:07:31.420
<v Speaker 2>this part of the story and I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to find it pretty funny.</v>

184
00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:33.320
<v Speaker 2>Odd as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

185
00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.420
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we'll back up a couple of years.</v>

186
00:07:35.421 --> 00:07:36.350
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

187
00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.300
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was obviously,</v>

188
00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:41.030
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started the band blink and blink went</v>

189
00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:43.630
<v Speaker 2>places and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then uh,</v>

190
00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:45.650
<v Speaker 2>but we always had a weird band</v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship,</v>

191
00:07:45.651 --> 00:07:49.610
<v Speaker 2>like most bands and we also thought that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we would never be big.</v>

192
00:07:49.611 --> 00:07:54.611
<v Speaker 2>So we started companies on the side and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a company that incubated a lot of</v>

193
00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:59.750
<v Speaker 2>small startups like software and apparel</v>
<v Speaker 2>and hardcore skate surf companies and</v>

194
00:07:59.751 --> 00:08:00.584
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that.</v>

195
00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:03.710
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I learned a lot from that and I pulled</v>

196
00:08:03.711 --> 00:08:07.730
<v Speaker 2>out and entertainment startup called to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the stars and I knew I was going to be</v>

197
00:08:07.731 --> 00:08:12.731
<v Speaker 2>doing kind of like science fiction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>franchised stories just like Disney,</v>

198
00:08:12.891 --> 00:08:15.890
<v Speaker 2>but science fiction for adults.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what that means is,</v>

199
00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:16.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I make a story,</v>

200
00:08:16.911 --> 00:08:19.700
<v Speaker 2>I title it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I brand it and I put out the book and I</v>

201
00:08:19.701 --> 00:08:21.320
<v Speaker 2>put up the merchandise and I go make a</v>
<v Speaker 2>movie,</v>

202
00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:22.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

203
00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:24.980
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a vertically integrated kind of</v>

204
00:08:24.981 --> 00:08:26.180
<v Speaker 2>model.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

205
00:08:26.181 --> 00:08:29.390
<v Speaker 2>one of the stories I knew I wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 2>put out with secret machines,</v>

206
00:08:29.391 --> 00:08:33.210
<v Speaker 2>which was kind of a historical fiction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

207
00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:35.330
<v Speaker 2>but based on real events about the UFO</v>
<v Speaker 2>phenomenon,</v>

208
00:08:35.331 --> 00:08:39.590
<v Speaker 2>but I also knew that I knew shit that</v>
<v Speaker 2>most people don't know because I've</v>

209
00:08:39.591 --> 00:08:43.670
<v Speaker 2>studied it for so long and I happened to</v>
<v Speaker 2>put some pieces together that most</v>

210
00:08:43.671 --> 00:08:45.020
<v Speaker 2>people don't put together.</v>

211
00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:49.910
<v Speaker 2>So before I came out with that book and</v>
<v Speaker 2>before I came out with the plan to take</v>

212
00:08:49.911 --> 00:08:51.380
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make major motion pictures and all that</v>

213
00:08:51.381 --> 00:08:52.940
<v Speaker 2>kind of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

214
00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:55.410
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew I needed to ask permission.</v>

215
00:08:55.620 --> 00:09:00.620
<v Speaker 2>So I flew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I flew around to places it can't say who</v>

216
00:09:01.681 --> 00:09:02.514
<v Speaker 2>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

217
00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:06.420
<v Speaker 2>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they listened to my pitch and um,</v>

218
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:10.230
<v Speaker 2>and then I got a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a email out of nowhere that says</v>

219
00:09:10.231 --> 00:09:12.210
<v Speaker 2>meet us next to the Pentagon at this day</v>
<v Speaker 2>and time.</v>

220
00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:16.090
<v Speaker 2>And I did that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And from mapping email from just,</v>

221
00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:17.230
<v Speaker 2>I just tend to person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

222
00:09:17.231 --> 00:09:17.491
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

223
00:09:17.491 --> 00:09:21.690
<v Speaker 2>I just can't tell you who it's from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so then I go out the next to the</v>

224
00:09:21.691 --> 00:09:23.940
<v Speaker 2>Pentagon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you just go to the Pentagon.</v>

225
00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:25.260
<v Speaker 2>I flew out depending on city.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

226
00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:26.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

227
00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:27.810
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is freaking out.</v>

228
00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:29.550
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I started freaking out,</v>

229
00:09:29.551 --> 00:09:30.384
<v Speaker 2>there's more shit.</v>

230
00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:32.400
<v Speaker 2>It gets way worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is nothing.</v>

231
00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:34.800
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that started me out in,</v>

232
00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:37.650
<v Speaker 2>out near DC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>taking some other high level meetings</v>

233
00:09:37.651 --> 00:09:40.350
<v Speaker 2>and there was somebody at a very high</v>
<v Speaker 2>level that,</v>

234
00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:41.840
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

235
00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:43.170
<v Speaker 2>close the door with many.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I says,</v>

236
00:09:43.171 --> 00:09:44.820
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to introduce you to somebody</v>

237
00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:50.300
<v Speaker 2>and that person comes to San Diego,</v>
<v Speaker 2>puts me on the phone with a general.</v>

238
00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:54.750
<v Speaker 2>And the general is listening to my</v>
<v Speaker 2>little stump speech about what I want to</v>

239
00:09:54.751 --> 00:09:57.360
<v Speaker 2>do with this franchise because it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I definitely didn't want to,</v>

240
00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:59.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't looking to like force</v>

241
00:09:59.791 --> 00:10:02.490
<v Speaker 2>disclosure and I wasn't looking to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>rogue and break secrets.</v>

242
00:10:02.491 --> 00:10:03.090
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

243
00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:07.800
<v Speaker 2>I know what's going on here and you guys</v>
<v Speaker 2>are doing a kick ass job.</v>

244
00:10:07.801 --> 00:10:09.720
<v Speaker 2>And I would have done the exact same</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

245
00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:12.640
<v Speaker 2>Should I have been the guy at the top</v>
<v Speaker 2>that had to make some really hardcore</v>

246
00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:14.310
<v Speaker 2>decisions 70 years ago.</v>

247
00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:15.810
<v Speaker 2>So I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to support you.</v>

248
00:10:15.811 --> 00:10:17.730
<v Speaker 2>I think people are cynical because</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a vacuum.</v>

249
00:10:17.731 --> 00:10:22.440
<v Speaker 2>You guys can't say what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So all these people are just coming up</v>

250
00:10:22.441 --> 00:10:23.970
<v Speaker 2>with a bunch of bullshit to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

251
00:10:23.971 --> 00:10:26.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't want us to know or we can't</v>

252
00:10:26.191 --> 00:10:28.230
<v Speaker 2>handle it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or it's all about oil and money and all</v>

253
00:10:28.231 --> 00:10:31.830
<v Speaker 2>this weird shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you would put these pieces together</v>

254
00:10:31.831 --> 00:10:35.430
<v Speaker 2>and independently I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so based on books that you read,</v>

255
00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:37.220
<v Speaker 2>yet people think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

256
00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:40.860
<v Speaker 2>people think that places like the CIA</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the dia,</v>

257
00:10:40.861 --> 00:10:42.570
<v Speaker 2>all these intelligence organizations</v>
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>

258
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.070
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

259
00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:45.810
<v Speaker 2>a monopoly on information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't,</v>

260
00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:47.970
<v Speaker 2>they get their information from the real</v>
<v Speaker 2>world too,</v>

261
00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:48.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

262
00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:51.160
<v Speaker 2>they do have access to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

263
00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:52.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>archives of information.</v>

264
00:10:52.771 --> 00:10:57.771
<v Speaker 2>They do have access to some amazing</v>
<v Speaker 2>satellite data and stuff like that.</v>

265
00:10:58.441 --> 00:11:01.500
<v Speaker 2>But if you're smart and you take your</v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

266
00:11:01.501 --> 00:11:03.210
<v Speaker 2>you know where to look and you find</v>
<v Speaker 2>patterns,</v>

267
00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:05.160
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can pretty much put together all the</v>

268
00:11:05.161 --> 00:11:05.550
<v Speaker 2>same shit.</v>

269
00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:07.350
<v Speaker 2>They can kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

270
00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:10.890
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when I pitched what I wanted to</v>

271
00:11:10.891 --> 00:11:11.970
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

272
00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:16.680
<v Speaker 2>come up and meet me tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I flew up to NASA,</v>

273
00:11:16.681 --> 00:11:20.340
<v Speaker 2>actually a Nasa Ames and had a two hour</v>
<v Speaker 2>meeting there.</v>

274
00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:23.100
<v Speaker 2>And after two hours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that person says,</v>

275
00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:25.830
<v Speaker 2>he looks me in the eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to introduce you to someone</v>

276
00:11:25.831 --> 00:11:27.600
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he did.</v>

277
00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:30.750
<v Speaker 2>And so I got on the phone with this</v>
<v Speaker 2>person and this person,</v>

278
00:11:30.751 --> 00:11:32.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a skeptic,</v>

279
00:11:32.371 --> 00:11:34.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm a skeptic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then at the end of the conversation</v>

280
00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.150
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

281
00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:37.560
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fly out and see me.</v>

282
00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:41.700
<v Speaker 2>And so I did and that's when things</v>
<v Speaker 2>really started happening.</v>

283
00:11:41.701 --> 00:11:45.390
<v Speaker 2>So I mean now I fly out to this airport</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

284
00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:48.870
<v Speaker 2>I sit at a table in a restaurant at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>airport,</v>

285
00:11:48.871 --> 00:11:52.920
<v Speaker 2>no one's in there and this gentleman</v>
<v Speaker 2>sits down and the waiter comes up,</v>

286
00:11:52.921 --> 00:11:53.980
<v Speaker 2>he waves off the waiter and he</v>

287
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:57.460
<v Speaker 1>looks me in the eye and says it was the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cold War and we found a life form and</v>

288
00:11:57.461 --> 00:12:00.250
<v Speaker 1>that's when I started shitting my pants</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I know a lot about this stuff.</v>

289
00:12:00.251 --> 00:12:05.251
<v Speaker 1>But you always wait to talk to somebody</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is one of the inside people you</v>

290
00:12:07.211 --> 00:12:11.050
<v Speaker 1>always want to have sits down at a</v>
<v Speaker 1>restaurant with you at the airport and</v>

291
00:12:11.051 --> 00:12:13.450
<v Speaker 1>tells you that they found a life form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

292
00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:17.050
<v Speaker 1>And during the Cold War,</v>
<v Speaker 1>during the Cold War and everything that</v>

293
00:12:17.051 --> 00:12:20.740
<v Speaker 1>they did in every decision they made at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time was because of the</v>

294
00:12:20.741 --> 00:12:23.650
<v Speaker 1>consciousness of the Cold War.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why's this guy decided to meet with you</v>

295
00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.930
<v Speaker 1>in an airport?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the only way you meet with these</v>

296
00:12:25.931 --> 00:12:28.570
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only way you ever would have anyone</v>

297
00:12:28.571 --> 00:12:31.120
<v Speaker 1>talk to you is if you can provide a</v>
<v Speaker 1>service that they need.</v>

298
00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:35.860
<v Speaker 1>And my service was pretty interesting to</v>
<v Speaker 1>them because I said,</v>

299
00:12:35.861 --> 00:12:36.790
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys,</v>

300
00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:38.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you struggle with saying,</v>

301
00:12:38.801 --> 00:12:40.780
<v Speaker 1>disclosure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to tell everybody everything,</v>

302
00:12:40.781 --> 00:12:42.490
<v Speaker 1>which I don't think everyone should know</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

303
00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:44.740
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you say they can't handle it,</v>

304
00:12:44.741 --> 00:12:46.090
<v Speaker 1>so don't tell them anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

305
00:12:46.091 --> 00:12:46.611
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

306
00:12:46.611 --> 00:12:49.870
<v Speaker 1>there's a middle road there and here's</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way I would do the middle road.</v>

307
00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:52.530
<v Speaker 1>And it resonated with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

308
00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:57.490
<v Speaker 1>And so we had a pretty epic conversation</v>
<v Speaker 1>for two hours.</v>

309
00:12:57.510 --> 00:12:58.600
<v Speaker 1>Why you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>

310
00:12:58.601 --> 00:13:02.410
<v Speaker 1>what is it about what your message was?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're idea was,</v>

311
00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:03.191
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

312
00:13:03.191 --> 00:13:06.760
<v Speaker 1>made them something to tell you some top</v>
<v Speaker 1>secret shit that they've tried to keep</v>

313
00:13:06.761 --> 00:13:09.280
<v Speaker 1>away from the American people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you tell your guy who was like a</v>

314
00:13:09.281 --> 00:13:12.940
<v Speaker 1>big celebrity who's in a huge rock band</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you and just say,</v>

315
00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:14.590
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meet me in an airport.</v>

316
00:13:14.591 --> 00:13:17.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to tell you about a life form</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we found during the Cold War.</v>

317
00:13:17.381 --> 00:13:20.290
<v Speaker 1>Because you're famous or because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know things?</v>

318
00:13:20.291 --> 00:13:21.790
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I have a service,</v>

319
00:13:21.791 --> 00:13:22.581
<v Speaker 1>so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a,</v>

320
00:13:22.581 --> 00:13:24.520
<v Speaker 1>it sounds easy when you play it like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

321
00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:26.410
<v Speaker 1>But if service,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a service,</v>

322
00:13:26.411 --> 00:13:31.240
<v Speaker 1>like what can you do for them that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>need help with communication.</v>

323
00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:33.640
<v Speaker 1>They don't have a way to make a movie a</v>
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>

324
00:13:33.641 --> 00:13:35.200
<v Speaker 1>They don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have a way to make</v>

325
00:13:35.201 --> 00:13:37.540
<v Speaker 1>documentaries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have a way to go on,</v>

326
00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:40.870
<v Speaker 1>on a big show like this and communicate</v>
<v Speaker 1>with young people.</v>

327
00:13:40.871 --> 00:13:43.720
<v Speaker 1>They don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And nor should they,</v>

328
00:13:43.721 --> 00:13:45.010
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they look at you gotta.</v>

329
00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:47.130
<v Speaker 1>Look at what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

330
00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:49.180
<v Speaker 1>so they look to you for a spokesperson</v>
<v Speaker 1>role.</v>

331
00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:52.030
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say spokesperson</v>
<v Speaker 1>communication,</v>

332
00:13:52.031 --> 00:13:53.110
<v Speaker 1>role,</v>
<v Speaker 1>communication,</v>

333
00:13:53.111 --> 00:13:54.220
<v Speaker 1>role.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense.</v>

334
00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:57.700
<v Speaker 1>They would give some information to you</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you would get it out to people.</v>

335
00:13:57.820 --> 00:13:59.380
<v Speaker 1>And now why wouldn't they do it</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves?</v>

336
00:13:59.381 --> 00:14:01.690
<v Speaker 1>Because they wouldn't have the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>platform.</v>

337
00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:05.650
<v Speaker 1>They don't have the same platform.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the other reason is as people have</v>

338
00:14:05.651 --> 00:14:09.940
<v Speaker 1>tried to do movies and stuff like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but none of none of them know.</v>

339
00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:13.570
<v Speaker 1>I was fortunate enough to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to know the core story.</v>

340
00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:16.960
<v Speaker 1>And most people don't explain that then</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't mind going back,</v>

341
00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:18.790
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you were able to put things</v>

342
00:14:18.791 --> 00:14:20.890
<v Speaker 1>together that other people weren't one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of those things.</v>

343
00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:25.630
<v Speaker 1>Essentially it's the book secret</v>
<v Speaker 1>machines where you have a lot of private</v>

344
00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:28.930
<v Speaker 1>finance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have some world bankers and you</v>

345
00:14:28.931 --> 00:14:30.390
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

346
00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:35.460
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people internationally working</v>
<v Speaker 1>together to figure out a plan of how to,</v>

347
00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:39.070
<v Speaker 1>how to push back against something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's been coming here for a very long</v>

348
00:14:39.071 --> 00:14:41.560
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But using off the books,</v>

349
00:14:41.561 --> 00:14:46.561
<v Speaker 1>finances and using mechanisms that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're not totally aware exist.</v>

350
00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:51.860
<v Speaker 1>And what people have to realize is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

351
00:14:51.861 --> 00:14:52.060
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

352
00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:57.060
<v Speaker 2>the UFO phenomenon isn't a phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's the universe is fucking gigantic</v>

353
00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:02.280
<v Speaker 2>and there's life everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every fucking where and,</v>

354
00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:04.520
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's a lot of life that's way</v>

355
00:15:04.521 --> 00:15:08.000
<v Speaker 2>more advanced than we are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And just like voyager left our solar</v>

356
00:15:08.001 --> 00:15:10.340
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little dinky satellite from the</v>

357
00:15:10.341 --> 00:15:13.340
<v Speaker 2>seventies there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And just like,</v>

358
00:15:13.341 --> 00:15:15.550
<v Speaker 2>my company's going to be building,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

359
00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:18.830
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this electromagnetic craft that really</v>

360
00:15:18.831 --> 00:15:20.990
<v Speaker 2>can do the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The time that I've been telling you</v>

361
00:15:20.991 --> 00:15:23.420
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Other civilizations have that too,</v>

362
00:15:23.421 --> 00:15:27.410
<v Speaker 2>which means you can traverse those</v>
<v Speaker 2>distances of space and what you have to</v>

363
00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:31.880
<v Speaker 2>think about is what happened when we</v>
<v Speaker 2>first discovered that and what did we do</v>

364
00:15:31.881 --> 00:15:33.650
<v Speaker 2>about it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's no,</v>

365
00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:36.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to look at 47 in a very</v>

366
00:15:36.081 --> 00:15:38.870
<v Speaker 2>peculiar way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ninety days after the Roseville event</v>

367
00:15:38.871 --> 00:15:41.570
<v Speaker 2>with CIA was created,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the air force was separated from the</v>

368
00:15:41.571 --> 00:15:43.490
<v Speaker 2>army.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The National Security Act was created</v>

369
00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:47.180
<v Speaker 2>and all those things are mechanisms to</v>
<v Speaker 2>start learning more and to start getting</v>

370
00:15:47.181 --> 00:15:48.590
<v Speaker 2>private industry off the ground.</v>

371
00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:50.450
<v Speaker 2>So they're going to do with World War</v>
<v Speaker 2>II.</v>

372
00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:52.400
<v Speaker 2>You think it had to do with aliens?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

373
00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:53.980
<v Speaker 2>I absolutely think it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

374
00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:56.360
<v Speaker 2>both because what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

375
00:15:56.660 --> 00:16:00.850
<v Speaker 2>what I believe crashed at Roswell was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

376
00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:06.610
<v Speaker 2>I believe it was German from Argentina,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it had hallmarks and technology</v>

377
00:16:06.981 --> 00:16:11.981
<v Speaker 2>based on alien technology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we put out a story saying it's alien</v>

378
00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:14.330
<v Speaker 2>and then we put out a story saying it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>a weather balloon,</v>

379
00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:18.020
<v Speaker 2>but the real thing it was we didn't want</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone to guess and that's why we put</v>

380
00:16:18.021 --> 00:16:20.840
<v Speaker 2>those two things out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's Kinda how they do it.</v>

381
00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:22.940
<v Speaker 2>I think they did that with the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

382
00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:25.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we went to the moon and then they put</v>

383
00:16:25.671 --> 00:16:27.760
<v Speaker 2>out this meme kind of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we can't,</v>

384
00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:29.030
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we didn't go to the moon,</v>

385
00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:30.650
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't want people really going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

386
00:16:30.651 --> 00:16:32.570
<v Speaker 2>what's on the moon that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

387
00:16:32.571 --> 00:16:36.230
<v Speaker 2>so these things are managed until they</v>
<v Speaker 2>can figure it out because you've got a</v>

388
00:16:36.231 --> 00:16:41.231
<v Speaker 2>bunch of normal dudes in suits sitting</v>
<v Speaker 2>at a big table like this and it's their</v>

389
00:16:41.391 --> 00:16:46.391
<v Speaker 2>fucking responsibility to figure this</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing out and this shit is monumentally</v>

390
00:16:47.751 --> 00:16:48.480
<v Speaker 2>big.</v>

391
00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:51.140
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but back to how they manage this.</v>

392
00:16:51.141 --> 00:16:55.160
<v Speaker 2>Then how these regular dudes without</v>
<v Speaker 2>access to communication like you have,</v>

393
00:16:55.161 --> 00:16:57.640
<v Speaker 2>how have they managed to disseminate</v>
<v Speaker 2>this information and,</v>

394
00:16:57.980 --> 00:16:59.810
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and sort of confuse everybody.</v>

395
00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:01.100
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

396
00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:02.660
<v Speaker 2>I can tell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how they did it.</v>

397
00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:04.820
<v Speaker 2>I do know that they infiltrated Ufo</v>
<v Speaker 2>groups.</v>

398
00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:06.710
<v Speaker 2>That was the very first thing they did</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the fifties,</v>

399
00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:12.300
<v Speaker 2>sort of like how FBI agents and</v>
<v Speaker 2>undercover cops infiltrated occupy Wall</v>

400
00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:14.870
<v Speaker 2>Street yet pretended to be radical</v>
<v Speaker 2>hippies and started fights.</v>

401
00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:15.920
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did that.</v>

402
00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:18.950
<v Speaker 2>They get access to what the civilians</v>
<v Speaker 2>are learning.</v>

403
00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:23.540
<v Speaker 2>How information transfers from one group</v>
<v Speaker 2>to another and then they start</v>

404
00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:27.600
<v Speaker 2>deflecting all their knowledge and</v>
<v Speaker 2>putting in leaks and this and that and</v>

405
00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:31.370
<v Speaker 2>getting them off the main track,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not because of disdain for citizens and</v>

406
00:17:31.371 --> 00:17:36.371
<v Speaker 2>not because</v>
<v Speaker 2>of any other reason than picture isis.</v>

407
00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:38.960
<v Speaker 2>We don't know what Isis is.</v>

408
00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:43.940
<v Speaker 2>They got a nuclear bomb and we caught a</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy trying to sneak in this mom.</v>

409
00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:45.950
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are they going to stop and come sit on</v>

410
00:17:45.951 --> 00:17:47.810
<v Speaker 2>your couch and tell you all about it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

411
00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:50.520
<v Speaker 2>And if you're like on the radio and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's all these people going,</v>

412
00:17:50.521 --> 00:17:51.390
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're gonna die.</v>

413
00:17:51.391 --> 00:17:51.971
<v Speaker 2>Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obama,</v>

414
00:17:51.971 --> 00:17:53.610
<v Speaker 2>Obama there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hold up a second.</v>

415
00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:55.650
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to fucking die,</v>

416
00:17:55.651 --> 00:17:59.070
<v Speaker 2>but we need to learn more about this and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got to figure it out before we sit</v>

417
00:17:59.071 --> 00:18:02.070
<v Speaker 2>down and talk to you about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what was the connection though</v>

418
00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:04.740
<v Speaker 2>specifically that you had figured out</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they knew,</v>

419
00:18:04.741 --> 00:18:07.350
<v Speaker 2>that you had figured out that people</v>
<v Speaker 2>hadn't put together?</v>

420
00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:08.340
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me just.</v>

421
00:18:08.341 --> 00:18:09.690
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let me go back to my story.</v>

422
00:18:09.691 --> 00:18:14.190
<v Speaker 2>So I put out this book and this book</v>
<v Speaker 2>deals with a book called the secret</v>

423
00:18:14.191 --> 00:18:18.870
<v Speaker 2>machines and it deals with secret,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

424
00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:21.870
<v Speaker 2>international finance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>private industry.</v>

425
00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:25.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm a secret space program,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

426
00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:29.850
<v Speaker 2>and a bunch of other things that your</v>
<v Speaker 2>research is both.</v>

427
00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:32.160
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How'd you get the information?</v>

428
00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:36.480
<v Speaker 2>I was just 25 years of reading shit and</v>
<v Speaker 2>watching videos and studying physics and</v>

429
00:18:36.481 --> 00:18:37.780
<v Speaker 2>studying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

430
00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:40.530
<v Speaker 2>the secrecy acts and all that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>weird shit,</v>

431
00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:42.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you put it together and a lot of it's</v>

432
00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:43.680
<v Speaker 2>bad information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

433
00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:48.060
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after a long time I realized I just</v>

434
00:18:48.061 --> 00:18:50.120
<v Speaker 2>realized what was going on there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

435
00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:53.280
<v Speaker 2>I've studied enough of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of international finance,</v>

436
00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:56.090
<v Speaker 2>some mechanisms that happen after World</v>
<v Speaker 2>War Two,</v>

437
00:18:56.310 --> 00:19:00.390
<v Speaker 2>what the Nazis were doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>technologically that no one really talks</v>

438
00:19:00.391 --> 00:19:02.460
<v Speaker 2>about to this day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were a hundred years ahead of us,</v>

439
00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:05.070
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about what their guys did at the end of</v>

440
00:19:05.071 --> 00:19:08.100
<v Speaker 2>the war and South America that's in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>paperclip.</v>

441
00:19:08.101 --> 00:19:10.680
<v Speaker 2>Paperclip was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's two levels of paperclip.</v>

442
00:19:10.681 --> 00:19:13.650
<v Speaker 2>Paperclip is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the operation that brought over all</v>

443
00:19:13.651 --> 00:19:18.420
<v Speaker 2>these ex Nazis into NASA and into all of</v>
<v Speaker 2>our aerospace programs.</v>

444
00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:19.950
<v Speaker 2>Why did we do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

445
00:19:19.951 --> 00:19:24.951
<v Speaker 2>because they knew some shit that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>very important and we said there might</v>

446
00:19:25.561 --> 00:19:27.480
<v Speaker 2>be a bigger issue out there to deal</v>
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>

447
00:19:27.481 --> 00:19:32.400
<v Speaker 2>So why don't we saw with the devil or</v>
<v Speaker 2>side with someone bad because there</v>

448
00:19:32.401 --> 00:19:34.530
<v Speaker 2>might be a devil out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's that kind of thinking.</v>

449
00:19:34.531 --> 00:19:39.000
<v Speaker 2>So they come in and thought it was about</v>
<v Speaker 2>competing with Russia to try to advance</v>

450
00:19:39.001 --> 00:19:40.260
<v Speaker 2>rocketry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

451
00:19:40.261 --> 00:19:42.690
<v Speaker 2>I believe that there was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

452
00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:45.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that there's a reason with the</v>

453
00:19:45.691 --> 00:19:49.470
<v Speaker 2>cold war never got hot is because we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>working with Russia on this specific</v>

454
00:19:49.471 --> 00:19:52.380
<v Speaker 2>issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think the reason why the Cold War</v>

455
00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:54.950
<v Speaker 2>never turned into an actual war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we were saying yeah.</v>

456
00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:58.980
<v Speaker 2>So it had nothing to do with the fact</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Russia was a communist empire and</v>

457
00:19:58.981 --> 00:19:59.550
<v Speaker 2>essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

458
00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:02.750
<v Speaker 2>it did spent them and they really did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>went under and collapsed.</v>

459
00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:04.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's different,</v>

460
00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:06.870
<v Speaker 2>there's different levels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like when someone goes,</v>

461
00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:09.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the US government did this.</v>

462
00:20:09.301 --> 00:20:10.320
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean?</v>

463
00:20:10.321 --> 00:20:13.050
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does that mean the CIA did it or the Dod</v>

464
00:20:13.051 --> 00:20:14.790
<v Speaker 2>did it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or Homeland Security did it.</v>

465
00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:18.870
<v Speaker 2>You're dealing with the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a trillion dollar organization.</v>

466
00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:22.260
<v Speaker 2>It's like if somebody's in apple leaks</v>
<v Speaker 2>and iphone,</v>

467
00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:23.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you going to say,</v>

468
00:20:23.701 --> 00:20:25.760
<v Speaker 2>oh my God at apple is doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apple is like,</v>

469
00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:28.530
<v Speaker 2>well shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're a $800,000,000,000 company.</v>

470
00:20:28.531 --> 00:20:30.570
<v Speaker 2>We have so many things going on</v>
<v Speaker 2>worldwide.</v>

471
00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:33.870
<v Speaker 2>It's impossible to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The entire organization believes one</v>

472
00:20:33.871 --> 00:20:36.780
<v Speaker 2>thing and the government's the same kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the same kind of way.</v>

473
00:20:36.781 --> 00:20:38.820
<v Speaker 2>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just a word.</v>

474
00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:40.570
<v Speaker 2>The US government's two words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

475
00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:41.640
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three years,</v>

476
00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:44.010
<v Speaker 2>four years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do we want to count this in the</v>

477
00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:44.880
<v Speaker 2>United States government?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three.</v>

478
00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:45.740
<v Speaker 2>Three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

479
00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:47.010
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>US has got a,</v>

480
00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:49.120
<v Speaker 2>you're going to find that you got to</v>
<v Speaker 2>figure this shit out.</v>

481
00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:50.920
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you have many,</v>

482
00:20:50.921 --> 00:20:55.330
<v Speaker 2>many layers of what's going on and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have some people worried on technology.</v>

483
00:20:55.331 --> 00:20:57.820
<v Speaker 2>Some people worrying about what's</v>
<v Speaker 2>happening that happening to the civilian</v>

484
00:20:57.821 --> 00:20:59.620
<v Speaker 2>population.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have some people worrying about,</v>

485
00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:01.180
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

486
00:21:01.181 --> 00:21:03.790
<v Speaker 2>how to keep everything afloat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to keep everything going.</v>

487
00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:07.210
<v Speaker 2>And you have a whole bunch of weird</v>
<v Speaker 2>military excursions and they're bumping</v>

488
00:21:07.211 --> 00:21:10.060
<v Speaker 2>into each other and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all these people aren't read in to</v>

489
00:21:10.061 --> 00:21:12.670
<v Speaker 2>what's going on with the UFO thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as all that shit.</v>

490
00:21:12.671 --> 00:21:15.490
<v Speaker 2>So who gets read in the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good question.</v>

491
00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:18.220
<v Speaker 2>If I had to guess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very,</v>

492
00:21:18.221 --> 00:21:23.140
<v Speaker 2>very senior technical bras and rockstars</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Rhonda wasn't red in trust me.</v>

493
00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:24.610
<v Speaker 2>They didn't tell you anything?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

494
00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:25.960
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they possibly did,</v>

495
00:21:25.961 --> 00:21:29.320
<v Speaker 2>but I wasn't read and read and I wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>brought into a skiff and they said this</v>

496
00:21:29.321 --> 00:21:31.720
<v Speaker 2>is what's going on even though I've been</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a skiff a few times.</v>

497
00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:34.270
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to skip this?</v>

498
00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:36.340
<v Speaker 2>A boat?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A skift is a,</v>

499
00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:41.950
<v Speaker 2>is a special compart mentalized</v>
<v Speaker 2>information facility.</v>

500
00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:43.133
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

501
00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:46.180
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're top secret shit can be discussed.</v>

502
00:21:46.181 --> 00:21:48.660
<v Speaker 2>I thought maybe they talk on boats</v>
<v Speaker 2>because nobody can hear you.</v>

503
00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:50.890
<v Speaker 2>They do that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do that.</v>

504
00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:52.450
<v Speaker 2>They do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They actually do.</v>

505
00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:56.650
<v Speaker 2>Because you can sweep for bugs on boats</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot easier than you can on a building.</v>

506
00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:57.560
<v Speaker 2>Make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

507
00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:01.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they tell you what.</v>

508
00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:04.420
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm sitting at that restaurant and</v>

509
00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:07.510
<v Speaker 2>says he found a live forum where they</v>
<v Speaker 2>found a life forum during the Cold War.</v>

510
00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:08.710
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I said,</v>

511
00:22:08.711 --> 00:22:09.490
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if find it,</v>

512
00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:10.660
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't ask him that question.</v>

513
00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:13.450
<v Speaker 2>Get many places.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did one time bring up.</v>

514
00:22:13.451 --> 00:22:14.284
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

515
00:22:14.290 --> 00:22:18.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking about talking about what</v>
<v Speaker 2>the crash and the late forties and they</v>

516
00:22:18.251 --> 00:22:19.450
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why just that one?</v>

517
00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:22.510
<v Speaker 2>That was the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I had to figure out a language to</v>

518
00:22:22.511 --> 00:22:24.220
<v Speaker 2>talk to these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever think that maybe this guy is</v>

519
00:22:24.221 --> 00:22:26.230
<v Speaker 2>bullshitting you or he's crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

520
00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:27.240
<v Speaker 2>fuck no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

521
00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:28.450
<v Speaker 2>you got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what you got to hear the whole</v>

522
00:22:28.451 --> 00:22:29.284
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

523
00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:30.460
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

524
00:22:30.461 --> 00:22:32.530
<v Speaker 2>So I'm sitting with them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we talk about a lot of things.</v>

525
00:22:32.531 --> 00:22:34.480
<v Speaker 2>I bring up the incidents with our</v>
<v Speaker 2>nuclear weapons.</v>

526
00:22:34.481 --> 00:22:36.430
<v Speaker 2>I bring up the incidences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

527
00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:38.500
<v Speaker 2>a few other things that I want to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>into.</v>

528
00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:40.360
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he goes,</v>

529
00:22:40.361 --> 00:22:42.610
<v Speaker 2>what do you need to do your project?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you,</v>

530
00:22:42.611 --> 00:22:43.810
<v Speaker 2>what are you looking for?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

531
00:22:43.811 --> 00:22:44.770
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need advisors,</v>

532
00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:45.693
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

533
00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:48.130
<v Speaker 2>I need people that are from different</v>
<v Speaker 2>areas.</v>

534
00:22:48.131 --> 00:22:49.480
<v Speaker 2>And the government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because everyone has their own</v>

535
00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:51.790
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

536
00:22:51.791 --> 00:22:55.270
<v Speaker 2>you have people at the National</v>
<v Speaker 2>Reconnaissance Office that have a</v>

537
00:22:55.271 --> 00:22:58.450
<v Speaker 2>perspective based on the satellite feeds</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're getting and these things are</v>

538
00:22:58.451 --> 00:22:59.640
<v Speaker 2>coming in and out of the atmosphere.</v>

539
00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:03.400
<v Speaker 2>Then you also have people from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>agency that are worried about in</v>

540
00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:06.550
<v Speaker 2>collecting information of what's going</v>
<v Speaker 2>on with people in different countries</v>

541
00:23:06.551 --> 00:23:07.540
<v Speaker 2>and here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

542
00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:12.570
<v Speaker 2>but then you also have engineers that</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a perspective on how the technology</v>

543
00:23:13.431 --> 00:23:16.510
<v Speaker 2>is made and what that might mean because</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of consciousness stuff</v>

544
00:23:16.511 --> 00:23:18.150
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that falls into this category there.</v>

545
00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:22.210
<v Speaker 2>So there are satellites that track them</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming in and out of the atmosphere.</v>

546
00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:23.890
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

547
00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:26.770
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What kinds of satellites are these?</v>

548
00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:28.240
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how the fuck,</v>

549
00:23:28.241 --> 00:23:30.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>usually forward looking for red,</v>

550
00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:32.980
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know what spectrum of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>infrared they're looking at.</v>

551
00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:38.130
<v Speaker 2>So there is some sort of a camera or</v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a detection device that</v>

552
00:23:38.651 --> 00:23:41.730
<v Speaker 2>they have in the atmosphere just to</v>
<v Speaker 2>check for Ufo.</v>

553
00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:43.130
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's just for you</v>
<v Speaker 2>iphones,</v>

554
00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:47.540
<v Speaker 2>they can pick up very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very specific heat signatures and they</v>

555
00:23:47.541 --> 00:23:52.541
<v Speaker 2>have algorithms because what you have is</v>
<v Speaker 2>a satellite is a device that can pick up</v>

556
00:23:53.991 --> 00:23:56.270
<v Speaker 2>what you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you program it to pick up.</v>

557
00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:59.030
<v Speaker 2>Now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you put a sensor on there but you got to</v>

558
00:23:59.031 --> 00:24:02.120
<v Speaker 2>tell the sensor what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if the sensor says,</v>

559
00:24:02.121 --> 00:24:05.480
<v Speaker 2>look something traveling at this speed</v>
<v Speaker 2>with this kind of heat,</v>

560
00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:07.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gotta record that you got to focus</v>

561
00:24:07.611 --> 00:24:11.710
<v Speaker 2>on it and that's what we call an icbm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if something comes in and zigzag</v>

562
00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:14.660
<v Speaker 2>stops and turns left and traveling 10</v>
<v Speaker 2>times faster than that,</v>

563
00:24:14.661 --> 00:24:16.760
<v Speaker 2>we need you to record that and focusing</v>
<v Speaker 2>on that as well.</v>

564
00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:21.230
<v Speaker 2>But if something just as moving low and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's only going 300 miles an hour and it</v>

565
00:24:21.231 --> 00:24:23.180
<v Speaker 2>has these big wings and Alo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

566
00:24:23.181 --> 00:24:24.470
<v Speaker 2>they're all just a plain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

567
00:24:24.471 --> 00:24:27.470
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it captures is based on,</v>

568
00:24:27.530 --> 00:24:30.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how it's programmed in the first place,</v>

569
00:24:30.930 --> 00:24:33.640
<v Speaker 2>but we can differentiate between media</v>
<v Speaker 2>rights and.</v>

570
00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:34.520
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

571
00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:35.440
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So okay.</v>

572
00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:37.340
<v Speaker 2>So how often are these things coming</v>
<v Speaker 2>into?</v>

573
00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:39.050
<v Speaker 2>Our Atmosphere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh shit,</v>

574
00:24:39.051 --> 00:24:39.940
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

575
00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:42.200
<v Speaker 2>I've had quite a few discussions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

576
00:24:42.201 --> 00:24:45.940
<v Speaker 2>one of the people I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been in contact with,</v>

577
00:24:46.030 --> 00:24:48.920
<v Speaker 2>one of my advisors for was from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>national reconnaissance office,</v>

578
00:24:48.921 --> 00:24:50.010
<v Speaker 2>high up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>high,</v>

579
00:24:50.011 --> 00:24:53.720
<v Speaker 2>high up and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they call it episodic visits.</v>

580
00:24:53.721 --> 00:24:57.270
<v Speaker 2>That's all I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Episodic have time periods where they,</v>

581
00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:58.610
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was,</v>

582
00:24:58.611 --> 00:25:01.460
<v Speaker 2>I saw a paper where they semesters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I figured out,</v>

583
00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:04.360
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the department of fence figured out a</v>

584
00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:08.210
<v Speaker 2>physicist there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an algorithm of how to compute when the</v>

585
00:25:08.211 --> 00:25:12.070
<v Speaker 2>things fly in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in collect smaller ships like mothership</v>

586
00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:13.490
<v Speaker 2>small ships.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

587
00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:18.520
<v Speaker 2>what at what longitude and latitude in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in what essentially what orbit it would</v>

588
00:25:18.591 --> 00:25:20.930
<v Speaker 2>land at when it would collect these</v>
<v Speaker 2>other machines.</v>

589
00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:24.230
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they tested that and in all I know is</v>

590
00:25:24.231 --> 00:25:27.320
<v Speaker 2>it was successful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would think this is happening on a</v>

591
00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:28.550
<v Speaker 2>very frequent basis.</v>

592
00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:30.350
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me tell you the rest of the story.</v>

593
00:25:30.410 --> 00:25:31.160
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

594
00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:31.971
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is,</v>

595
00:25:31.971 --> 00:25:35.060
<v Speaker 2>it's important because you'll see 'em.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he goes,</v>

596
00:25:35.061 --> 00:25:35.661
<v Speaker 2>what do you need?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

597
00:25:35.661 --> 00:25:37.310
<v Speaker 2>I need to advisors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

598
00:25:37.311 --> 00:25:38.480
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so next thing you know,</v>

599
00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:40.730
<v Speaker 2>I leave and two weeks later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bam,</v>

600
00:25:40.731 --> 00:25:41.121
<v Speaker 2>Bam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bam,</v>

601
00:25:41.121 --> 00:25:43.370
<v Speaker 2>my email starts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have all these admirals,</v>

602
00:25:43.371 --> 00:25:44.390
<v Speaker 2>all these generals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

603
00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:48.320
<v Speaker 2>no intelligence people other than,</v>
<v Speaker 2>other than bras that were connected with</v>

604
00:25:48.321 --> 00:25:49.880
<v Speaker 2>the national reconnaissance office.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

605
00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:52.670
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nashville office has half air force and</v>

606
00:25:52.671 --> 00:25:54.740
<v Speaker 2>half CIA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

607
00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:56.690
<v Speaker 2>but they're all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all military.</v>

608
00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:00.350
<v Speaker 2>And so I start talking to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I start meeting with them,</v>

609
00:26:00.351 --> 00:26:05.351
<v Speaker 2>I fly out to Colorado Springs and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a general and a colonel and they</v>

610
00:26:05.871 --> 00:26:07.260
<v Speaker 2>look at me and they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

611
00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:08.420
<v Speaker 2>they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

612
00:26:08.421 --> 00:26:09.920
<v Speaker 2>do you need anything else?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you good?</v>

613
00:26:09.921 --> 00:26:10.760
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

614
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.040
<v Speaker 2>I think you guys should talk to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>defense intelligence agency.</v>

615
00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:13.873
<v Speaker 2>And they go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

616
00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:15.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't want to upset them.</v>

617
00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:18.050
<v Speaker 2>I want to make sure everyone's kosher</v>
<v Speaker 2>with what I'm about to do.</v>

618
00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:20.720
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the kernel looks at me and he goes,</v>

619
00:26:20.721 --> 00:26:23.630
<v Speaker 2>do you ask your dad for permission after</v>
<v Speaker 2>your mom's already given it to you?</v>

620
00:26:23.631 --> 00:26:24.261
<v Speaker 2>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

621
00:26:24.261 --> 00:26:25.670
<v Speaker 2>And he's all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've been given permission,</v>

622
00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:27.380
<v Speaker 2>shut the fuck up and get to work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

623
00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:28.940
<v Speaker 2>alright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I did,</v>

624
00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:32.870
<v Speaker 2>so I go out and I put the book out there</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I started doing national radio,</v>

625
00:26:32.871 --> 00:26:34.420
<v Speaker 2>like the art bill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so coast to coast.</v>

626
00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:36.290
<v Speaker 2>Ordinarily I do all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Next thing you know,</v>

627
00:26:36.291 --> 00:26:41.291
<v Speaker 2>I get approached by somebody with a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at a certain agency and that guy comes</v>

628
00:26:41.451 --> 00:26:43.290
<v Speaker 2>to San Diego and puts me in a small</v>
<v Speaker 2>room,</v>

629
00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:44.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

630

<v Speaker 1>and I got a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you would call interrogated for two</v>

631
00:26:49.411 --> 00:26:51.560
<v Speaker 1>days straight saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>we need to know who the fuck you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

633

<v Speaker 1>what like what specifically should you</v>
<v Speaker 1>not have known?</v>

635
00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:03.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's in the book,</v>

636
00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:06.570
<v Speaker 1>everything I've been telling you today</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're dealing with there,</v>

637
00:27:06.571 --> 00:27:09.810
<v Speaker 1>there is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a concerted international</v>

638
00:27:09.811 --> 00:27:14.010
<v Speaker 1>effort to deal with this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was in my book and that is,</v>

639
00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:17.460
<v Speaker 1>it's not like Roswell crashed and it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>not like,</v>

640
00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:20.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like all the typical Ufo Shit that</v>

641
00:27:20.431 --> 00:27:24.030
<v Speaker 1>people dwell on isn't the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just that there's something crashed</v>

642
00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:27.810
<v Speaker 1>or someone saw got abducted and saw this</v>
<v Speaker 1>or someone pulled a little piece of</v>

643
00:27:27.811 --> 00:27:31.230
<v Speaker 1>metal out of their body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no one's put together what we're</v>

644
00:27:31.231 --> 00:27:33.240
<v Speaker 1>doing about it because our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>

645
00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:35.940
<v Speaker 1>our countrymen since World War Two</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't stupid,</v>

646
00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:37.770
<v Speaker 1>is what set them off there.</v>

647
00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:39.330
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was the thing that you said that</v>

00:27:39.331 --> 00:27:42.720
<v Speaker 1>you should not have known the A in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>

649
00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:45.350
<v Speaker 1>it is my belief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

650
00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:48.930
<v Speaker 1>that we have an incredible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

651
00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:54.290
<v Speaker 1>we've made incredible strides creating a</v>
<v Speaker 1>assets to deal with this stuff.</v>

652
00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:58.200
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's my belief and I'm not speaking</v>

653
00:27:58.201 --> 00:28:00.250
<v Speaker 1>for my company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just nonsense.</v>

654
00:28:00.730 --> 00:28:03.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean some sort of government agency</v>

655
00:28:03.301 --> 00:28:06.510
<v Speaker 1>that has been designed or other</v>
<v Speaker 1>international international.</v>

<v Speaker 1>alien life and that was enough that they</v>

<v Speaker 1>it was an interrogation,</v>

661
00:28:20.581 --> 00:28:24.390
<v Speaker 1>but it was a pretty heavy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heavy debriefing of how I got to where I</v>

<v Speaker 1>They didn't know they thought I was at</v>
<v Speaker 1>snowden.</v>

688
00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:19.440
<v Speaker 1>They thought I was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They thought there was a group of people</v>

00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:37.110
<v Speaker 1>you're a rockstar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>

696
00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:39.150
<v Speaker 1>but I'm saying some pretty provocative</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

697
00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:42.160
<v Speaker 1>You got to realize no one else has</v>

698
00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:45.220
<v Speaker 2>gone up there and talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

699
00:29:46.570 --> 00:29:47.450
<v Speaker 2>Once again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

700
00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:51.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm in a tricky spot right now because a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of what happened back then,</v>

701
00:29:51.730 --> 00:29:53.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't really get into now because of</v>

702
00:29:53.891 --> 00:29:55.660
<v Speaker 2>the positions and the things I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>involved with,</v>

703
00:29:56.380 --> 00:29:59.440
<v Speaker 2>but read the book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it was just because you printed</v>

704
00:29:59.441 --> 00:30:02.530
<v Speaker 2>this stuff in the book that they wanted</v>
<v Speaker 2>to pull you aside and talk to you about</v>

705
00:30:02.531 --> 00:30:05.230
<v Speaker 2>this for two days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was all over radio and talking</v>

706
00:30:05.231 --> 00:30:07.870
<v Speaker 2>about it and I was saying some other</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy shit that I can't repeat.</v>

707
00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:10.030
<v Speaker 2>So people listening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they want to go back and look at</v>

708
00:30:10.031 --> 00:30:11.350
<v Speaker 2>those interviews,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a better way to.</v>

709
00:30:11.351 --> 00:30:12.820
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you had said something in those</v>

710
00:30:12.821 --> 00:30:16.000
<v Speaker 2>interviews that you can't say again</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they told you to stop talking</v>

711
00:30:16.001 --> 00:30:16.990
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely,</v>

712
00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:18.640
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They tell you to stop talking about the</v>

713
00:30:18.641 --> 00:30:20.020
<v Speaker 2>fact that you can't talk about it.</v>

714
00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:21.460
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

715
00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:23.040
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

716
00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:26.080
<v Speaker 2>the more of the issue was what are you</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to achieve?</v>

717
00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:28.840
<v Speaker 2>And once they found out who I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>working with,</v>

718
00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:29.920
<v Speaker 2>they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

719
00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:35.220
<v Speaker 2>And they only found that out when</v>
<v Speaker 2>wikileaks broke into John Podesta's</v>

720
00:30:35.981 --> 00:30:40.750
<v Speaker 2>emails in my.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was having video conferences and</v>

721
00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:42.780
<v Speaker 2>conference calls with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

722
00:30:42.850 --> 00:30:44.740
<v Speaker 2>he was Obama's senior advisor at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

723
00:30:44.741 --> 00:30:46.450
<v Speaker 2>So the Wall Street Journal broke the</v>
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>

724
00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:49.050
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's this rock star talking about Ufos</v>

725
00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:51.370
<v Speaker 2>with Hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hillary Clinton's campaign manager,</v>

726
00:30:52.450 --> 00:30:54.760
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was Obama's senior advisor so I had</v>

727
00:30:54.761 --> 00:30:55.900
<v Speaker 2>nothing to do with Hillary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

728
00:30:55.901 --> 00:30:59.950
<v Speaker 2>so we were setting these up and when</v>
<v Speaker 2>that broke I had to call up my partner</v>

729
00:30:59.951 --> 00:31:02.520
<v Speaker 2>from the CIA and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

730
00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:05.350
<v Speaker 2>I got to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I got no,</v>

731
00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:07.510
<v Speaker 2>I can talk to you a little bit more</v>
<v Speaker 2>about who these people are.</v>

732
00:31:08.050 --> 00:31:12.880
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's where I gained a really large</v>

733
00:31:12.881 --> 00:31:17.300
<v Speaker 2>amount of credibility with them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also where they realized that we got</v>

734
00:31:17.301 --> 00:31:22.301
<v Speaker 2>to figure out a better way to do this</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what you see is me and some very</v>

735
00:31:23.291 --> 00:31:26.620
<v Speaker 2>important people coming together to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that I think is really</v>

736
00:31:26.621 --> 00:31:29.620
<v Speaker 2>beneficial to society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But a lot we have a lot of work to do</v>

737
00:31:29.621 --> 00:31:32.230
<v Speaker 2>because a lot of people think they don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>know what to think of it.</v>

738
00:31:32.231 --> 00:31:34.270
<v Speaker 2>At first they thought I was nuts when I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was talking about my book.</v>

739
00:31:34.271 --> 00:31:34.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>

740
00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:36.400
<v Speaker 2>these advisors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

741
00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:39.640
<v Speaker 2>And then all of a sudden the Wall Street</v>
<v Speaker 2>Journal broke this story and there's all</v>

742
00:31:39.641 --> 00:31:44.641
<v Speaker 2>these multi star generals and head of</v>
<v Speaker 2>some really big aerospace companies.</v>

743
00:31:44.891 --> 00:31:47.380
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the big news organizations were</v>

744
00:31:47.381 --> 00:31:49.480
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>

745
00:31:49.481 --> 00:31:50.680
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this might be real.</v>

746
00:31:50.681 --> 00:31:53.260
<v Speaker 2>A lot of kids still don't know and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're having fun on the Internet.</v>

747
00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:56.140
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I came out a couple of weeks</v>

748
00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:59.860
<v Speaker 2>ago on stage with all these people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's like now all the big huge.</v>

749
00:31:59.861 --> 00:32:02.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm dealing with some crazy big</v>
<v Speaker 2>mainstream press that,</v>

750
00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:05.260
<v Speaker 2>that we're trying to keep at bay for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>variety of reasons.</v>

751
00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:06.610
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yes,</v>

752
00:32:06.611 --> 00:32:11.440
<v Speaker 2>it's all true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what to the stars is really after is</v>

753
00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:14.830
<v Speaker 2>how do we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do we bring the public in on this</v>

754
00:32:15.010 --> 00:32:19.420
<v Speaker 2>and work together to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to communicate and educate this stuff.</v>

755
00:32:19.570 --> 00:32:23.080
<v Speaker 2>How do we bring the technology out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the shadows and build it for the world?</v>

756
00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:25.090
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and how do we,</v>

757
00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:26.740
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

758
00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:30.130
<v Speaker 2>tell the story in documentaries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nonfiction,</v>

759
00:32:30.131 --> 00:32:33.340
<v Speaker 2>fictional works over a period of years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if we do that,</v>

760
00:32:33.341 --> 00:32:35.620
<v Speaker 2>the public owns it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The public has a say,</v>

761
00:32:35.621 --> 00:32:38.260
<v Speaker 2>they're a part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then people will start to understand</v>

762
00:32:38.261 --> 00:32:40.100
<v Speaker 2>over time why they did what they did.</v>

763
00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:42.660
<v Speaker 2>They didn't lie to people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

764
00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:45.560
<v Speaker 2>just out of like ego.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's they are like,</v>

765
00:32:45.561 --> 00:32:47.540
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this group called Isis and</v>

766
00:32:47.541 --> 00:32:50.840
<v Speaker 2>they're here and we need to understand</v>
<v Speaker 2>them and we need to fucking figure it</v>

767
00:32:50.841 --> 00:32:52.290
<v Speaker 2>out quick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

768
00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:56.210
<v Speaker 2>but the problem is these are</v>
<v Speaker 2>extraordinarily advanced civilizations</v>

769
00:32:56.211 --> 00:32:59.480
<v Speaker 2>that have been coming here forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why it's all in all the ancient</v>

770
00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:04.340
<v Speaker 2>fucking scripts and texts and carved</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the rocks and all that shit.</v>

771
00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:07.250
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but trying to figure it out,</v>

772
00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:09.620
<v Speaker 2>trying to connect the dots and trying</v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

773
00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:14.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean looking at debris that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably still have in a warehouse</v>

774
00:33:14.031 --> 00:33:16.430
<v Speaker 2>going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have no fucking clue how to,</v>

775
00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:18.830
<v Speaker 2>how to make this or back engineer this</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

776
00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:24.070
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a piece of metal from a</v>
<v Speaker 2>crash that I've seen and I've seen the</v>

777
00:33:24.711 --> 00:33:29.711
<v Speaker 2>science on it and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so it's atomically aligned and it's</v>

778
00:33:29.931 --> 00:33:33.770
<v Speaker 2>layered and multi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 80 layers within just a few microns</v>

779
00:33:34.130 --> 00:33:38.120
<v Speaker 2>of purities of metal that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that aren't even in our solar system.</v>

780
00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:42.950
<v Speaker 2>And they think it needs to be made in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in an area where there's no gravity.</v>

781
00:33:42.951 --> 00:33:44.480
<v Speaker 2>So number one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has to be made in space.</v>

782
00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:48.500
<v Speaker 2>Number two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if we were to create a machine that</v>

783
00:33:48.501 --> 00:33:52.970
<v Speaker 2>can potentially do some of this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three d printing layers of different</v>

784
00:33:52.971 --> 00:33:57.290
<v Speaker 2>metals that have obscene purities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would cost hundreds and hundreds of</v>

785
00:33:57.291 --> 00:33:59.000
<v Speaker 2>millions of dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't even have that.</v>

786
00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:00.980
<v Speaker 2>Why did they think it was made without</v>
<v Speaker 2>gravity?</v>

787
00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:02.120
<v Speaker 2>Because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

788
00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:04.410
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the atomic structure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what happens is,</v>

789
00:34:04.411 --> 00:34:08.510
<v Speaker 2>is when you radiate it with Terahertz,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it loses mass,</v>

790
00:34:09.050 --> 00:34:10.700
<v Speaker 2>something weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it resonates,</v>

791
00:34:10.910 --> 00:34:14.690
<v Speaker 2>some kind of harmonic and then it gets</v>
<v Speaker 2>lighter and if you hit it with enough</v>

792
00:34:14.691 --> 00:34:15.650
<v Speaker 2>terahertz,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll float.</v>

793
00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:17.780
<v Speaker 2>So we're going to be showing people this</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

794
00:34:17.781 --> 00:34:20.090
<v Speaker 2>We're going to be bringing out the</v>
<v Speaker 2>hardware.</v>

795
00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:22.250
<v Speaker 2>Some of the hard work will be bringing</v>
<v Speaker 2>out implants that are going to be</v>

796
00:34:22.251 --> 00:34:23.000
<v Speaker 2>bringing up videos.</v>

797
00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.350
<v Speaker 2>We're going to be bringing in showing</v>
<v Speaker 2>people this actual physical piece of</v>

798
00:34:27.351 --> 00:34:31.160
<v Speaker 2>metal that was constructed in a zero</v>
<v Speaker 2>gravity environment and space.</v>

799
00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:34.790
<v Speaker 2>And if you hit it with enough energy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it becomes weightless.</v>

800
00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:36.020
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say wait list.</v>

801
00:34:36.021 --> 00:34:37.820
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if we can make enough</v>
<v Speaker 2>energy to do that.</v>

802
00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:40.460
<v Speaker 2>But yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is our plan in not only show the</v>

803
00:34:40.461 --> 00:34:44.330
<v Speaker 2>experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you can't give it enough energy to</v>

804
00:34:44.331 --> 00:34:47.630
<v Speaker 2>make it weightless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you give it enough energy to reduce</v>

805
00:34:47.631 --> 00:34:48.500
<v Speaker 2>the mass?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

806
00:34:48.501 --> 00:34:50.060
<v Speaker 2>So it weighs less.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

807
00:34:50.090 --> 00:34:51.530
<v Speaker 2>And you can prove this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

808
00:34:51.531 --> 00:34:55.280
<v Speaker 2>And that's why I didn't have a scale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can put this piece of do scale.</v>

809
00:34:55.281 --> 00:34:56.300
<v Speaker 2>I'll do you better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

810
00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:59.810
<v Speaker 2>it's not even that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's warping the space time continuum</v>

811
00:34:59.811 --> 00:35:01.310
<v Speaker 2>around the objects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you shoot.</v>

812
00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:04.010
<v Speaker 2>What you can do is you can shoot an</v>
<v Speaker 2>electron over it.</v>

813
00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:07.310
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's why it's not a single electron and</v>

814
00:35:07.311 --> 00:35:10.760
<v Speaker 2>you collect it in time that how do you</v>
<v Speaker 2>shoot a single electron final?</v>

815
00:35:10.761 --> 00:35:12.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm not physicists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just do this shit.</v>

816
00:35:12.410 --> 00:35:13.700
<v Speaker 2>That's what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

817
00:35:13.701 --> 00:35:15.380
<v Speaker 2>And I was actually on a phone call today</v>
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

818
00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:20.000
<v Speaker 2>I talked for about 45 minutes in the car</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the way up here about some of the,</v>

819
00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:22.220
<v Speaker 2>some of the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How would they even be able to regulate</v>

820
00:35:22.221 --> 00:35:24.700
<v Speaker 2>whether or not they have a single</v>
<v Speaker 2>electron will do.</v>

821
00:35:24.930 --> 00:35:26.690
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're doing crazier shit than that at</v>

822
00:35:26.691 --> 00:35:27.720
<v Speaker 2>cern.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At cern,</v>

823
00:35:27.721 --> 00:35:31.550
<v Speaker 2>they're taking particles of atoms and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're speeding them up to light speed.</v>

824
00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:32.570
<v Speaker 2>Almost lights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

825
00:35:32.571 --> 00:35:35.720
<v Speaker 2>And slamming them into each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm not too worried about electron</v>

826
00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:38.190
<v Speaker 2>electrons and photons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ms Dot building.</v>

827
00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:42.990
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's sirens like 10 miles in the</v>

828
00:35:42.991 --> 00:35:44.850
<v Speaker 1>lab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen an electron microscope?</v>

829
00:35:44.851 --> 00:35:46.390
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the size of half of this too,</v>

830
00:35:46.391 --> 00:35:49.980
<v Speaker 1>but I'm saying they're launching a</v>
<v Speaker 1>single electron at this thing.</v>

831
00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:52.470
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

832
00:35:53.130 --> 00:35:54.810
<v Speaker 1>they do that with photons too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

833
00:35:55.110 --> 00:35:57.540
<v Speaker 1>I read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read a really cool study about single</v>

834
00:35:57.541 --> 00:36:00.660
<v Speaker 1>photons and consciousness was</v>
<v Speaker 1>interacting with it.</v>

835
00:36:00.690 --> 00:36:03.510
<v Speaker 1>Just just by thinking it was changing</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way the photon went.</v>

836
00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:06.030
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what happens is,</v>

837
00:36:06.031 --> 00:36:09.720
<v Speaker 1>is you shoot this electron and you know</v>
<v Speaker 1>how fast it is to travel over this piece</v>

838
00:36:09.721 --> 00:36:11.010
<v Speaker 1>of metal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you,</v>

839
00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:14.910
<v Speaker 1>then you radiate it with terahertz and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you shouldn't mean radiated with</v>

840
00:36:14.911 --> 00:36:15.740
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

841
00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:19.610
<v Speaker 1>you're your electrifying and charging</v>
<v Speaker 1>the piece of material noted terahertz.</v>

842
00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:20.460
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

843
00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:23.700
<v Speaker 1>it's a high frequency wave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to pretend I know that much</v>

844
00:36:23.701 --> 00:36:24.090
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

845
00:36:24.090 --> 00:36:29.090
<v Speaker 1>I just know that the earlier tests were</v>
<v Speaker 1>with radio waves like rf and uh,</v>

846
00:36:29.491 --> 00:36:31.060
<v Speaker 1>and they need to do terahertz.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

847
00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:34.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't know much more than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so and so by radio,</v>

848
00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:38.430
<v Speaker 1>by shooting terahertz at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the piece of metal can lose mass and</v>

849
00:36:38.431 --> 00:36:42.960
<v Speaker 1>then when you shoot an electron over it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll be a different time than the other</v>

850
00:36:42.961 --> 00:36:44.850
<v Speaker 1>one when it's not turned on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that make sense?</v>

851
00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:48.370
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The time it takes for an electron to go</v>

852
00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:49.980
<v Speaker 1>over the piece of metal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>

853
00:36:50.250 --> 00:36:53.640
<v Speaker 1>Jamie's been terahertz imaging,</v>
<v Speaker 1>laser guided codes,</v>

854
00:36:53.641 --> 00:36:57.000
<v Speaker 1>advanced single pixel tele terahertz</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagery,</v>

855
00:36:57.570 --> 00:37:02.570
<v Speaker 1>and this be the images sampled upon</v>
<v Speaker 1>instructions from a laser,</v>

856
00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:07.380
<v Speaker 1>a the terahertz light passes through the</v>
<v Speaker 1>object and then see the information is</v>

857
00:37:07.381 --> 00:37:11.070
<v Speaker 1>collected to reconstruct the image.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>

858
00:37:11.610 --> 00:37:14.460
<v Speaker 1>So with this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just an imaging technique,</v>

859
00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:19.200
<v Speaker 1>you're timing how fast it takes an</v>
<v Speaker 1>electron to move over the surface of the</v>

860
00:37:19.201 --> 00:37:19.920
<v Speaker 1>metal.</v>

861
00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:23.430
<v Speaker 1>Then you charge the metal and then your</v>
<v Speaker 1>timing the exact same thing and there</v>

862
00:37:23.431 --> 00:37:27.630
<v Speaker 1>will be different times and the positive</v>
<v Speaker 1>result is that it lost mass so it</v>

863
00:37:27.631 --> 00:37:30.810
<v Speaker 1>traveled faster or slow or whatever the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hell is supposed to happen.</v>

864
00:37:30.811 --> 00:37:33.870
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I would imagine that this,</v>

865
00:37:34.050 --> 00:37:36.180
<v Speaker 1>just this piece of metal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it exists,</v>

866
00:37:36.181 --> 00:37:40.680
<v Speaker 1>would be kind of game over if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>brought this piece of metal to the most</v>

867
00:37:40.681 --> 00:37:44.760
<v Speaker 1>advanced scientists and metallurgy or</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever they would be that would</v>

868
00:37:44.761 --> 00:37:46.210
<v Speaker 1>understand this kind of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

869
00:37:46.290 --> 00:37:48.780
<v Speaker 1>And it had already been there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is,</v>

870
00:37:48.781 --> 00:37:51.240
<v Speaker 1>is there anywhere online where people</v>
<v Speaker 1>can read about this,</v>

871
00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:52.560
<v Speaker 1>there actually is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some,</v>

872
00:37:52.590 --> 00:37:56.310
<v Speaker 1>some of this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not this piece in particular that came</v>

873
00:37:56.311 --> 00:37:59.910
<v Speaker 1>out as arts parts on arts bell a long</v>
<v Speaker 1>time ago and there are different layers</v>

874
00:37:59.911 --> 00:38:02.700
<v Speaker 1>of business and magnesium.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I uh,</v>

875
00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:08.000
<v Speaker 1>but this one came from a crash in 48,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not 47 and I know nothing more about it,</v>

876
00:38:09.451 --> 00:38:11.820
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think it's anything that can</v>
<v Speaker 1>come in here with the chain of custody</v>

877
00:38:11.821 --> 00:38:14.460
<v Speaker 1>and say this came from air force or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

878
00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:16.230
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who has this.</v>

879
00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:19.200
<v Speaker 1>So you're going to bring this and</v>
<v Speaker 1>demonstrate this to people.</v>

880
00:38:19.201 --> 00:38:20.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason is,</v>

881
00:38:20.341 --> 00:38:23.550
<v Speaker 1>is because we need to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're also going to show,</v>

882
00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:27.060
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>videos that just got declassified from</v>

883
00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:30.960
<v Speaker 1>our most advanced systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they call it the Aegis Aegis</v>

884
00:38:30.961 --> 00:38:33.540
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a radar system and forward looking</v>

885
00:38:33.541 --> 00:38:35.980
<v Speaker 1>for red of Ufo is have those in</v>
<v Speaker 1>possession</v>

886
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:38.530
<v Speaker 2>actually already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we're going to show the videos</v>

887
00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:40.480
<v Speaker 2>that just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the first time in history,</v>

888
00:38:40.481 --> 00:38:43.660
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that videos of Ufo iphones have been</v>

889
00:38:43.661 --> 00:38:46.210
<v Speaker 2>declassified.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's been leaks and there has been</v>

890
00:38:46.211 --> 00:38:49.180
<v Speaker 2>people catching shit on their phones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I have all the chain of custody,</v>

891
00:38:49.181 --> 00:38:52.750
<v Speaker 2>all the documents and everything and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>just got those a few weeks ago and</v>

892
00:38:52.751 --> 00:38:56.470
<v Speaker 2>there's a shitload more common.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we'll release the videos and</v>

893
00:38:56.471 --> 00:38:58.690
<v Speaker 2>we'll show the experiment as a proof of</v>
<v Speaker 2>concept.</v>

894
00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:01.420
<v Speaker 2>So everyone knows the shits all rail</v>
<v Speaker 2>because right now they're just looking</v>

895
00:39:01.421 --> 00:39:03.730
<v Speaker 2>at a drawing and they're looking at this</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy from the skunk works,</v>

896
00:39:04.090 --> 00:39:04.751
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just going,</v>

897
00:39:04.751 --> 00:39:08.560
<v Speaker 2>how the fuck are they going to build a</v>
<v Speaker 2>machine that plays with time and plays</v>

898
00:39:08.561 --> 00:39:12.220
<v Speaker 2>with the fabric of space time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we have to kind of educate people</v>

899
00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:13.690
<v Speaker 2>and say it's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's possible.</v>

900
00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:15.820
<v Speaker 2>And yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>

901
00:39:15.860 --> 00:39:20.860
<v Speaker 2>They're advanced electro gravitt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gravitic propulsion is that.</v>

902
00:39:22.151 --> 00:39:25.420
<v Speaker 2>I say that electrogravitics gravitic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what that does,</v>

903
00:39:25.421 --> 00:39:28.780
<v Speaker 2>what the machine does that we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>building is there's A.</v>

904
00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:33.460
<v Speaker 2>There's an electromagnetic wave that is</v>
<v Speaker 2>the foundation of everything,</v>

905
00:39:33.461 --> 00:39:34.750
<v Speaker 2>of all mass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of everything.</v>

906
00:39:34.751 --> 00:39:37.270
<v Speaker 2>Like it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people call it zero point energy,</v>

907
00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:42.420
<v Speaker 2>some people call it a the vacuum energy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like one inch of air could power the</v>

908
00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:46.510
<v Speaker 2>United States for like hundreds of years</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of thing or maybe more.</v>

909
00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:51.700
<v Speaker 2>So what they got to do is isolate very</v>
<v Speaker 2>specific atoms to where all the noise of</v>

910
00:39:51.701 --> 00:39:54.670
<v Speaker 2>all matter and cell phones and</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything that's going on on earth can</v>

911
00:39:54.671 --> 00:39:57.850
<v Speaker 2>be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can be separated from this one Adam.</v>

912
00:39:58.060 --> 00:40:00.670
<v Speaker 2>And if you can do that with the right</v>
<v Speaker 2>material,</v>

913
00:40:00.910 --> 00:40:04.480
<v Speaker 2>you can get access to that</v>
<v Speaker 2>electromagnetic wave that's powering the</v>

914
00:40:04.481 --> 00:40:05.260
<v Speaker 2>atom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

915
00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:07.690
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the invisible wave pattern that that's</v>

916
00:40:07.691 --> 00:40:09.490
<v Speaker 2>under everything of all existence.</v>

917
00:40:09.850 --> 00:40:12.940
<v Speaker 2>And once you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like splitting an atom.</v>

918
00:40:13.150 --> 00:40:17.980
<v Speaker 2>This is the power behind the atom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's extraordinarily dangerous,</v>

919
00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:22.780
<v Speaker 2>but it's also what will turn that thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>on and it'll turn into a ball of light</v>

920
00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:25.300
<v Speaker 2>and just disappear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I could show you a video of,</v>

921
00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:27.670
<v Speaker 2>of something doing that that's actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>on youtube,</v>

922

<v Speaker 3>And if you spell it right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>astro,</v>

00:41:42.681 --> 00:41:47.360
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is going on in this show?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most the vast majority of the people</v>

952
00:41:47.361 --> 00:41:51.230
<v Speaker 1>just listened to this show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for the people that are just</v>

953
00:41:51.231 --> 00:41:53.300
<v Speaker 1>listening and you want to go check it</v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

954
00:41:53.330 --> 00:41:58.330
<v Speaker 1>t are 38,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Astra Aurora project through s a f o</v>

955
00:41:59.870 --> 00:42:00.980
<v Speaker 1>three b.</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>

956
00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:04.190
<v Speaker 1>This is the craft in secret machines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's all I'm going to say.</v>

957
00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:09.240
<v Speaker 1>This thing is floating in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll take a few seconds till they turn</v>

958
00:42:11.361 --> 00:42:12.194
<v Speaker 1>on the engine.</v>

959
00:42:14.330 --> 00:42:15.540
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks pretty bad ass.</v>

960
00:42:15.590 --> 00:42:17.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't wait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see little lights dancing around</v>

961
00:42:17.401 --> 00:42:21.090
<v Speaker 1>on the bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think this was leaked on purpose</v>

962
00:42:21.091 --> 00:42:24.900
<v Speaker 1>because the guy's making a just hard</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to see moving the camera around</v>

963
00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:29.960
<v Speaker 1>in and out of focus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got like he's barely focusing soy.</v>

964
00:42:30.091 --> 00:42:32.160
<v Speaker 1>That looks like a drone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

965
00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:34.290
<v Speaker 1>it looks small to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

966
00:42:34.291 --> 00:42:36.840
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would think that one's about 40 feet.</v>

967
00:42:37.130 --> 00:42:37.600
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

968
00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:40.680
<v Speaker 1>see the tail fins on the back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how you know it's not alien per</v>

969
00:42:40.681 --> 00:42:41.730
<v Speaker 1>se.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's built off.</v>

970
00:42:41.790 --> 00:42:46.010
<v Speaker 1>I think technology that came from there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

971
00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:49.080
<v Speaker 1>they don't need vertical tail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stabilize that big light.</v>

972
00:42:49.230 --> 00:42:50.700
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the engine they turn it on.</v>

973
00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:54.390
<v Speaker 1>So right now they're at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're accessing that energy I told you</v>

974
00:42:54.391 --> 00:42:55.980
<v Speaker 1>about now and watch what happens.</v>

975
00:42:57.230 --> 00:42:58.063
<v Speaker 3>It's gone.</v>

976
00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:00.670
<v Speaker 1>There's a pilot in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that was in a movie,</v>

977
00:43:00.671 --> 00:43:04.840
<v Speaker 1>I'd want my money back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This movie can suck my Dick.</v>

978
00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:05.410
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

979
00:43:05.410 --> 00:43:08.480
<v Speaker 1>Like so fake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh that don't look fate.</v>

980
00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:11.150
<v Speaker 1>What does that tr three beers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These ones,</v>

981
00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:13.660
<v Speaker 1>the other ones are the same one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but these ones are stacked and that's a</v>

982
00:43:13.661 --> 00:43:16.210
<v Speaker 1>drone that came out of one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a drone.</v>

983
00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:19.090
<v Speaker 1>The small one is have the little thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that came out the side.</v>

984
00:43:19.150 --> 00:43:20.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you.</v>

985
00:43:20.141 --> 00:43:23.080
<v Speaker 1>You can look up black triangle Ufo and</v>
<v Speaker 1>find hundreds of these videos.</v>

986
00:43:23.410 --> 00:43:28.150
<v Speaker 1>So these are a people look civilians</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are getting this from the ground</v>

987
00:43:28.510 --> 00:43:29.440
<v Speaker 1>filming this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

988
00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:31.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where this one came.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One came from.</v>

989
00:43:31.470 --> 00:43:33.940
<v Speaker 1>This is not the same account as the last</v>
<v Speaker 1>video.</v>

990
00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:38.350
<v Speaker 1>Different video ended up next because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably a tr three wii video.</v>

991
00:43:38.710 --> 00:43:41.300
<v Speaker 1>How many views is out $474,000.</v>

992
00:43:41.570 --> 00:43:44.100
<v Speaker 1>Now there's sundry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so many people know now.</v>

993
00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:47.770
<v Speaker 1>There's hundreds of these out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what separates from the other one?</v>

994
00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:52.800
<v Speaker 1>But everyone thinks everyone thinks I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's alien and that's not my belief.</v>

995
00:43:53.140 --> 00:43:55.090
<v Speaker 1>So you think this is something along the</v>
<v Speaker 1>lines,</v>

996
00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:57.070
<v Speaker 1>like when they had the stealth bomber</v>
<v Speaker 1>program,</v>

997
00:43:57.100 --> 00:43:58.510
<v Speaker 1>they were experimenting with these</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

998
00:43:58.780 --> 00:44:01.330
<v Speaker 1>What do you think of Robert Lazaro?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that guy's real?</v>

999
00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:04.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm putting out his autobiography.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you do think he's legit and you</v>

1000
00:44:04.370 --> 00:44:05.260
<v Speaker 1>should read his book?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1001
00:44:05.261 --> 00:44:06.094
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

1002
00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:08.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a fascinating character,</v>

1003
00:44:08.441 --> 00:44:09.850
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is.</v>

1004
00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:13.440
<v Speaker 1>He is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His story is really interesting to where</v>

1005
00:44:13.450 --> 00:44:15.940
<v Speaker 1>he really fucked up though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for the people that don't know that</v>

1006
00:44:15.941 --> 00:44:17.980
<v Speaker 1>are listening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a guy that came out.</v>

1007
00:44:17.981 --> 00:44:21.880
<v Speaker 1>He's the reason we know about area 51.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He literally is,</v>

1008
00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:25.420
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the guy that broke the story of its</v>

1009
00:44:25.421 --> 00:44:30.200
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got brought in for a job and that</v>

1010
00:44:30.550 --> 00:44:32.250
<v Speaker 1>during the they said we have another</v>

1011
00:44:32.250 --> 00:44:34.430
<v Speaker 2>idea for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they put them in a,</v>

1012
00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:39.150
<v Speaker 2>a place he claims had all these disks</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was on a back engineering team as</v>

1013
00:44:39.151 --> 00:44:40.450
<v Speaker 2>a physicist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1014
00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:44.500
<v Speaker 2>but what happened was they rushed him in</v>
<v Speaker 2>there because per his story,</v>

1015
00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:48.090
<v Speaker 2>they tried to cut into one of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>propulsion devices and it exploded and</v>

1016
00:44:48.091 --> 00:44:51.240
<v Speaker 2>killed a bunch of scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the Nevada test site,</v>

1017
00:44:51.241 --> 00:44:54.720
<v Speaker 2>which is the area where area 51 and all</v>
<v Speaker 2>that stuff is released a statement that</v>

1018
00:44:54.721 --> 00:44:56.460
<v Speaker 2>they were just doing a small little nuke</v>
<v Speaker 2>test,</v>

1019
00:44:56.700 --> 00:45:00.150
<v Speaker 2>but it was really because of this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they rushed him in there without</v>

1020
00:45:00.151 --> 00:45:03.120
<v Speaker 2>doing all of his background checks</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it takes six months to a year.</v>

1021
00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:04.373
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1022
00:45:04.410 --> 00:45:07.290
<v Speaker 2>during those background checks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was already working on this stuff.</v>

1023
00:45:07.740 --> 00:45:08.520
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1024
00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:13.230
<v Speaker 2>they found that his wife was going a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little haywire because he couldn't tell</v>

1025
00:45:13.231 --> 00:45:14.430
<v Speaker 2>her what she was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what he was doing.</v>

1026
00:45:14.430 --> 00:45:15.780
<v Speaker 2>And he would leave in the middle of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>night.</v>

1027
00:45:15.781 --> 00:45:18.210
<v Speaker 2>He'd be gone for a week and she was</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting fed up.</v>

1028
00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:21.810
<v Speaker 2>And so she started having an affair and</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they're listening in all the phone</v>

1029
00:45:21.811 --> 00:45:23.850
<v Speaker 2>calls and checking them out and I kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of go on his home.</v>

1030
00:45:23.851 --> 00:45:26.670
<v Speaker 2>Life is unstable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they stopped calling him to come into</v>

1031
00:45:26.671 --> 00:45:28.860
<v Speaker 2>work while they figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He knows.</v>

1032
00:45:28.861 --> 00:45:30.870
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's working next to a guy with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>machine gun.</v>

1033
00:45:31.350 --> 00:45:33.240
<v Speaker 2>He knows that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1034
00:45:33.241 --> 00:45:36.600
<v Speaker 2>that this is no fucking joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It no one knows what he's been doing.</v>

1035
00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:41.370
<v Speaker 2>And he thought he did something wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as the nervous individual he is,</v>

1036
00:45:41.371 --> 00:45:44.670
<v Speaker 2>he runs to his friends and says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what I've been doing.</v>

1037
00:45:44.790 --> 00:45:46.860
<v Speaker 2>This is what I've been working on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's alien craft.</v>

1038
00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:49.950
<v Speaker 2>It's over here at groom lake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the tests are every Wednesday night</v>

1039
00:45:49.951 --> 00:45:51.810
<v Speaker 2>at 8:00.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And his wife goes,</v>

1040
00:45:51.811 --> 00:45:52.644
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

1041
00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:54.060
<v Speaker 2>And his friend goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

1042
00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:54.751
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on,</v>

1043
00:45:54.751 --> 00:45:55.310
<v Speaker 2>I'll show you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1044
00:45:55.310 --> 00:45:57.720
<v Speaker 2>they drive three hours north of Vegas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>outs on public land.</v>

1045
00:45:57.810 --> 00:46:01.890
<v Speaker 2>And they videotape and watch these ufos</v>
<v Speaker 2>come up and be tested and dart around</v>

1046
00:46:01.891 --> 00:46:03.360
<v Speaker 2>and disappear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>

1047
00:46:03.361 --> 00:46:05.220
<v Speaker 2>that's the one I'm working on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's almost like,</v>

1048
00:46:05.221 --> 00:46:06.300
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how did you know what time?</v>

1049
00:46:06.301 --> 00:46:07.470
<v Speaker 2>Because I'm working on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1050
00:46:07.471 --> 00:46:09.420
<v Speaker 2>he does this three times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was three times and on the</v>

1051
00:46:09.421 --> 00:46:11.190
<v Speaker 2>third time they got caught because</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1052
00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:13.240
<v Speaker 2>I've been there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's security that,</v>

1053
00:46:13.330 --> 00:46:15.750
<v Speaker 2>that travels those mountains.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You always hear about those guys out</v>

1054
00:46:15.751 --> 00:46:17.910
<v Speaker 2>there and area 51,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they caught him,</v>

1055
00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:20.040
<v Speaker 2>they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>holy fuck.</v>

1056
00:46:20.250 --> 00:46:21.330
<v Speaker 2>He's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1057
00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:23.130
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is he doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1058
00:46:23.131 --> 00:46:26.580
<v Speaker 2>why is he telling everything?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he runs to the new station with</v>

1059
00:46:26.581 --> 00:46:28.650
<v Speaker 2>George Knapp who another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another,</v>

1060
00:46:28.651 --> 00:46:32.310
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a host on coast to coast and he</v>

1061
00:46:32.311 --> 00:46:36.600
<v Speaker 2>tells him what he's doing and he just</v>
<v Speaker 2>goes live on Las Vegas news and it</v>

1062
00:46:36.601 --> 00:46:38.290
<v Speaker 2>caught like wildfire fire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1063
00:46:38.291 --> 00:46:39.870
<v Speaker 2>across the world.</v>

1064
00:46:40.110 --> 00:46:42.480
<v Speaker 2>And so then these guys grabbed him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put him in a room,</v>

1065
00:46:42.481 --> 00:46:45.600
<v Speaker 2>put a gun to his head and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we told you not to say anything,</v>

1066
00:46:45.601 --> 00:46:47.760
<v Speaker 2>we didn't mean say everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1067
00:46:47.950 --> 00:46:49.380
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got really scared.</v>

1068
00:46:49.410 --> 00:46:52.200
<v Speaker 2>They started fucking with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was actually at a meeting two nights</v>

1069
00:46:52.201 --> 00:46:53.580
<v Speaker 2>ago talking about some of the things</v>
<v Speaker 2>they did.</v>

1070
00:46:53.581 --> 00:46:55.830
<v Speaker 2>One of the things he did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he went to a gym he used to.</v>

1071
00:46:55.950 --> 00:46:58.650
<v Speaker 2>He didn't have access to a lot of guns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if for some fucking reason he had</v>

1072
00:46:58.651 --> 00:47:00.720
<v Speaker 2>like an Uzi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was in his glove compartment.</v>

1073
00:47:01.020 --> 00:47:03.600
<v Speaker 2>He goes to a gym and he comes out and</v>
<v Speaker 2>his car doors are open,</v>

1074
00:47:03.601 --> 00:47:06.480
<v Speaker 2>the glove compartment is open,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the Uzi just sitting on his chair,</v>

1075
00:47:06.750 --> 00:47:10.080
<v Speaker 2>he got a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got shot out on the freeway and they</v>

1076
00:47:10.081 --> 00:47:12.170
<v Speaker 2>erased a bunch of his records.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1077
00:47:12.190 --> 00:47:14.190
<v Speaker 2>and he still to this day really nervous</v>
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

1078
00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:17.010
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he always claimed he put for a while.</v>

1079
00:47:17.011 --> 00:47:19.530
<v Speaker 2>He claimed he had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of this is what I will say.</v>

1080
00:47:19.531 --> 00:47:24.531
<v Speaker 2>He claimed the energy source was an</v>
<v Speaker 2>element that was very heavy and it was</v>

1081
00:47:24.961 --> 00:47:26.400
<v Speaker 2>like on a pentium or something like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1082
00:47:26.401 --> 00:47:30.220
<v Speaker 2>One 15 element and a 25 years ago he</v>
<v Speaker 2>talked</v>

1083
00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:31.053
<v Speaker 1>all about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's.</v>

1084
00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:33.970
<v Speaker 1>And then literally three years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe four,</v>

1085
00:47:34.390 --> 00:47:37.120
<v Speaker 1>they added it to the periodic table.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is this stuff called again?</v>

1086
00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:39.700
<v Speaker 1>I think it's called underpin am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one element.</v>

1087
00:47:39.701 --> 00:47:41.480
<v Speaker 1>One 15.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's on.</v>

1088
00:47:41.710 --> 00:47:43.420
<v Speaker 1>And that's the other thing is people</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't realize,</v>

1089
00:47:43.470 --> 00:47:45.190
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>25 years ago,</v>

1090
00:47:45.191 --> 00:47:47.950
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this element comes from a binary star</v>

1091
00:47:47.951 --> 00:47:50.770
<v Speaker 1>system and it's really heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a certain isotope that stable,</v>

1092
00:47:50.980 --> 00:47:52.540
<v Speaker 1>they'll find it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then all of a sudden,</v>

1093
00:47:52.541 --> 00:47:55.810
<v Speaker 1>I remember one day I was driving my car</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I heard it like on CNN new element</v>

1094
00:47:55.811 --> 00:47:57.100
<v Speaker 1>added to the periodic table.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1095
00:47:57.190 --> 00:47:58.450
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1096
00:47:58.930 --> 00:48:01.300
<v Speaker 1>But it's pretty interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crazy story.</v>

1097
00:48:01.690 --> 00:48:03.850
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they erased his history.</v>

1098
00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:08.650
<v Speaker 1>What is the claim that he had raised his</v>
<v Speaker 1>educational record?</v>

1099
00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:11.740
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he might have people.</v>

1100
00:48:11.741 --> 00:48:13.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I think this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even,</v>

1101
00:48:13.700 --> 00:48:14.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never researched it,</v>

1102
00:48:14.921 --> 00:48:17.680
<v Speaker 1>but people that I know that have</v>
<v Speaker 1>researched,</v>

1103
00:48:17.681 --> 00:48:20.020
<v Speaker 1>I think he might have kind of upgraded</v>
<v Speaker 1>his residence,</v>

1104
00:48:20.050 --> 00:48:22.840
<v Speaker 1>his resume a little bit and maybe he</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't go to mit.</v>

1105
00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:27.170
<v Speaker 4>That was the claim.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But they also said that he really did</v>

1106
00:48:27.171 --> 00:48:29.000
<v Speaker 4>work for a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's that</v>

1107
00:48:29.310 --> 00:48:31.340
<v Speaker 1>New Mexico?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1108
00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:33.270
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lawrence livermore and jpl.</v>

1109
00:48:33.330 --> 00:48:35.160
<v Speaker 1>Jpl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jpl in Pasadena.</v>

1110
00:48:35.210 --> 00:48:36.043
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1111
00:48:36.140 --> 00:48:36.961
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it was,</v>

1112
00:48:36.961 --> 00:48:40.350
<v Speaker 1>it was in New Mexico that they had found</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he actually did work in the</v>

1113
00:48:40.351 --> 00:48:42.090
<v Speaker 1>building even though they tried to say</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he didn't.</v>

1114
00:48:42.170 --> 00:48:45.720
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I did something with somebody and</v>

1115
00:48:45.750 --> 00:48:50.750
<v Speaker 1>however much of his store was true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>always gets fishy when you find one</v>

1116
00:48:50.761 --> 00:48:54.840
<v Speaker 1>thing that's not true like that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't go to mit and Freedom Stanton,</v>

1117
00:48:55.830 --> 00:48:58.650
<v Speaker 1>Stanton Friedman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's a very famous UFO researcher.</v>

1118
00:48:59.130 --> 00:49:03.360
<v Speaker 1>He's one of the main guys arguing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bob was ours full of Shit.</v>

1119
00:49:03.390 --> 00:49:04.081
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1120
00:49:04.081 --> 00:49:07.920
<v Speaker 1>what's interesting is there is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a,</v>

1121
00:49:07.921 --> 00:49:10.140
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that guy that did all the</v>

1122
00:49:10.141 --> 00:49:14.080
<v Speaker 1>research on that and I know that guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>that studied it for decades and uh,</v>

1123
00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:16.860
<v Speaker 1>he's actually writing a forward on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>

1124
00:49:16.861 --> 00:49:21.861
<v Speaker 1>It's the journalist has one like eight</v>
<v Speaker 1>peabody awards and Emmys and shit.</v>

1125
00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:24.180
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>George Knapp,</v>

1126
00:49:24.210 --> 00:49:26.070
<v Speaker 1>who I told you about and he's just got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1127
00:49:26.071 --> 00:49:30.690
<v Speaker 1>he could speak for hours on that entire</v>
<v Speaker 1>funds on the coast to coast show,</v>

1128
00:49:30.691 --> 00:49:32.610
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't like a couple Sundays each</v>

1129
00:49:32.610 --> 00:49:33.870
<v Speaker 1>month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I find that element.</v>

1130
00:49:34.620 --> 00:49:38.010
<v Speaker 1>What does it element 1:15,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that what it's called?</v>

1131
00:49:39.690 --> 00:49:41.160
<v Speaker 1>Popular mechanics article about it.</v>

1132
00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:45.720
<v Speaker 4>Welcome element 1:15 now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's your real name?</v>

1133
00:49:45.990 --> 00:49:49.320
<v Speaker 4>Researchers create element 1:15,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the lab for the second time over the</v>

1134
00:49:49.321 --> 00:49:52.710
<v Speaker 4>first time over all in the first time in</v>
<v Speaker 4>a decade,</v>

1135
00:49:53.100 --> 00:49:56.250
<v Speaker 4>paving the way for its official status</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a member of the periodic table.</v>

1136
00:49:56.520 --> 00:49:59.910
<v Speaker 4>And so google,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bob Lasar element 1:15 because I would</v>

1137
00:49:59.911 --> 00:50:02.910
<v Speaker 4>think that if he knew that like that</v>
<v Speaker 4>long ago,</v>

1138
00:50:02.930 --> 00:50:05.550
<v Speaker 4>like that alone would make people want</v>
<v Speaker 4>to take them more seriously.</v>

1139
00:50:05.970 --> 00:50:07.800
<v Speaker 4>All the stuff that he said.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well first of all,</v>

1140
00:50:07.801 --> 00:50:11.280
<v Speaker 4>we know that there was a groom lake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We know that there is an area 51 we know</v>

1141
00:50:11.281 --> 00:50:15.090
<v Speaker 4>they denied its existence and so they</v>
<v Speaker 4>wanted to expand the perimeter to till</v>

1142
00:50:15.450 --> 00:50:19.470
<v Speaker 4>they wanted to because people would sit</v>
<v Speaker 4>on a ledge and they would watch all</v>

1143
00:50:19.471 --> 00:50:21.990
<v Speaker 4>these test flights of whatever the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 4>they had.</v>

1144
00:50:21.991 --> 00:50:24.480
<v Speaker 4>Whatever it was they were doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether working on stealth bombers,</v>

1145
00:50:24.481 --> 00:50:27.620
<v Speaker 4>whatever it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people would film this and so they</v>

1146
00:50:27.621 --> 00:50:27.980
<v Speaker 4>wanted to</v>

1147
00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:32.060
<v Speaker 1>expand the perimeter of prohibited area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so in doing so,</v>

1148
00:50:32.061 --> 00:50:34.400
<v Speaker 1>they had to admit the existence of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>base itself.</v>

1149
00:50:34.770 --> 00:50:36.350
<v Speaker 1>I believe that was in the nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1150
00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:38.450
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was in the nineties.</v>

1151
00:50:38.451 --> 00:50:41.810
<v Speaker 1>They expanded the perimeter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something else that the government had</v>

1152
00:50:41.811 --> 00:50:45.340
<v Speaker 1>to do is they had to admit you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>photos are real because there was a um,</v>

1153
00:50:45.380 --> 00:50:47.780
<v Speaker 1>some military people look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1154
00:50:47.970 --> 00:50:50.840
<v Speaker 1>He talks about 1:15 all through this</v>
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

1155
00:50:50.900 --> 00:50:53.840
<v Speaker 1>This Jamie doesn't say the video on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom.</v>

1156
00:50:53.841 --> 00:50:55.820
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When was this put out?</v>

1157
00:50:56.030 --> 00:50:57.290
<v Speaker 1>This video?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1158
00:50:57.291 --> 00:51:00.620
<v Speaker 1>this one is 2015,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the video is taken on vhs.</v>

1159
00:51:01.090 --> 00:51:03.380
<v Speaker 1>Holy Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is 1990.</v>

1160
00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:07.700
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's on the Scifi channel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Back when it was spelled Saifai.</v>

1161
00:51:07.940 --> 00:51:09.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone uses a lot.</v>

1162
00:51:09.130 --> 00:51:10.820
<v Speaker 1>That's why f Y.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1163
00:51:11.180 --> 00:51:12.350
<v Speaker 1>That's old as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1164
00:51:13.190 --> 00:51:15.860
<v Speaker 1>Played some of that though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that dude's a trip because he's</v>

1165
00:51:15.861 --> 00:51:17.690
<v Speaker 1>one of those weird guys where if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even,</v>

1166
00:51:17.691 --> 00:51:20.990
<v Speaker 1>if you're a skeptical guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you listen to bibles are talking like</v>

1167
00:51:21.970 --> 00:51:23.810
<v Speaker 1>sky is obviously smart as fuck.</v>

1168
00:51:25.050 --> 00:51:30.050
<v Speaker 5>Here we go in the top of the reactor,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the base of the reactor apparently</v>

1169
00:51:31.020 --> 00:51:34.500
<v Speaker 5>is</v>
<v Speaker 5>something similar to a cyclotron.</v>

1170
00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:39.920
<v Speaker 5>If the particle accelerator a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a particle is accelerated the high speed</v>

1171
00:51:41.730 --> 00:51:46.730
<v Speaker 5>and then deflect it up a small tube and</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's aimed at the 1:15,</v>

1172
00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:50.490
<v Speaker 5>this transmute the 1:15.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1173
00:51:50.910 --> 00:51:54.600
<v Speaker 5>similar to the way we do that in a</v>
<v Speaker 5>normal particle accelerator,</v>

1174
00:51:56.250 --> 00:52:01.250
<v Speaker 5>this causes a reaction or radiation</v>
<v Speaker 5>emission that we really haven't seen</v>

1175
00:52:01.381 --> 00:52:03.020
<v Speaker 5>before.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1176
00:52:03.150 --> 00:52:07.950
<v Speaker 5>it produces annie matter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This Annie matter is guided down,</v>

1177
00:52:08.050 --> 00:52:11.670
<v Speaker 5>attuned to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and reacts with a gap</v>

1178
00:52:13.470 --> 00:52:15.030
<v Speaker 5>when matter in any matter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>react,</v>

1179
00:52:15.031 --> 00:52:20.031
<v Speaker 5>they convert to 100 percent energy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This energy is converted,</v>

1180
00:52:22.650 --> 00:52:24.990
<v Speaker 5>heat energy is converted to electrical</v>
<v Speaker 5>power,</v>

1181
00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:27.780
<v Speaker 5>and the reactor itself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This was done through a</v>

1182
00:52:29.700 --> 00:52:34.230
<v Speaker 5>thermoelectric converting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And this electrical power is used to</v>

1183
00:52:34.231 --> 00:52:38.360
<v Speaker 5>power other subsystems on the craft.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Though there is no wiring as we would</v>

1184
00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:42.660
<v Speaker 5>know it also.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's almost a byproduct of the</v>

1185
00:52:42.661 --> 00:52:45.840
<v Speaker 5>reactor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The reactor also sets up a gravitational</v>

1186
00:52:45.841 --> 00:52:50.310
<v Speaker 5>wave from the 1:15 being bombarded this</v>
<v Speaker 5>gravitational wave,</v>

1187
00:52:50.311 --> 00:52:54.240
<v Speaker 5>it was present at the top of the reactor</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it is essentially guided in the same</v>

1188
00:52:54.241 --> 00:52:58.490
<v Speaker 5>way microwaves are guided through tune</v>
<v Speaker 5>tubes and uh,</v>

1189
00:52:58.530 --> 00:53:01.950
<v Speaker 5>this goes to and they're amplifying</v>
<v Speaker 5>cavities and through the projectors that</v>

1190
00:53:01.951 --> 00:53:02.940
<v Speaker 5>are in the bottom of the crap.</v>

1191
00:53:02.990 --> 00:53:04.250
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish I was smart enough to know</v>

1192
00:53:04.251 --> 00:53:06.020
<v Speaker 1>whether he's full of Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1193
00:53:07.270 --> 00:53:11.370
<v Speaker 1>so what he's saying is that there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>gravity wave that's accessible on,</v>

1194
00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:15.110
<v Speaker 1>on a really large element that extends</v>
<v Speaker 1>beyond the perimeter of the atom.</v>

1195
00:53:15.650 --> 00:53:19.190
<v Speaker 1>And when you bombard that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that element with one particle Kinda</v>

1196
00:53:19.220 --> 00:53:21.680
<v Speaker 1>like what we were talking about before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it goes through a tube,</v>

1197
00:53:21.681 --> 00:53:25.410
<v Speaker 1>like a very tiny miniature cern cern's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a big magnet holds a particle in a</v>

1198
00:53:25.411 --> 00:53:25.980
<v Speaker 1>very specific</v>

1199
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:28.530
<v Speaker 2>spot at hovers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It shoots and it hits that.</v>

1200
00:53:28.531 --> 00:53:31.050
<v Speaker 2>It decays,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it becomes this matter anti matter</v>

1201
00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:32.370
<v Speaker 2>reaction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1202
00:53:32.371 --> 00:53:36.420
<v Speaker 2>these generators can convert all that</v>
<v Speaker 2>energy into power and then they can</v>

1203
00:53:36.450 --> 00:53:40.380
<v Speaker 2>amplify that wave that's coming off and</v>
<v Speaker 2>emanating from that element.</v>

1204
00:53:40.470 --> 00:53:43.050
<v Speaker 2>And they amplify it like you would</v>
<v Speaker 2>amplify or a radio wave.</v>

1205
00:53:44.340 --> 00:53:47.190
<v Speaker 2>Now there's no wires in the craft</v>
<v Speaker 2>because most likely it was three d</v>

1206
00:53:47.191 --> 00:53:48.900
<v Speaker 2>printed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We didn't know about three d printing</v>

1207
00:53:48.901 --> 00:53:50.850
<v Speaker 2>back then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've talked to Bob about this,</v>

1208
00:53:51.180 --> 00:53:53.160
<v Speaker 2>but not just three d,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three d printing,</v>

1209
00:53:53.190 --> 00:53:54.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just the materials.</v>

1210
00:53:54.931 --> 00:53:58.980
<v Speaker 2>But atomically aligning the elements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

1211
00:53:59.010 --> 00:54:04.010
<v Speaker 2>So consciousness and other types of</v>
<v Speaker 2>things can move through those materials</v>

1212
00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:07.100
<v Speaker 2>to operate the craft.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really good</v>

1213
00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:09.620
<v Speaker 4>operating it without buttons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1214
00:54:09.630 --> 00:54:12.300
<v Speaker 4>Operating it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that was theoretically he said</v>

1215
00:54:12.301 --> 00:54:13.021
<v Speaker 4>theoretically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1216
00:54:13.021 --> 00:54:15.480
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was that there was handprints and that,</v>

1217
00:54:15.630 --> 00:54:18.210
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were much different shaped hands</v>

1218
00:54:18.211 --> 00:54:23.211
<v Speaker 4>and ours in this craft that he had found</v>
<v Speaker 4>inside one of these bays and area 51,</v>

1219
00:54:24.870 --> 00:54:28.230
<v Speaker 4>he realized very quickly that it wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>something that we had created and that</v>

1220
00:54:28.231 --> 00:54:31.260
<v Speaker 4>it was somehow another powered through</v>
<v Speaker 4>intention.</v>

1221
00:54:31.420 --> 00:54:33.810
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That would go through like touch or feel</v>

1222
00:54:33.811 --> 00:54:38.310
<v Speaker 4>or or put their hands would be on this</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing and consciously you would somehow</v>

1223
00:54:38.311 --> 00:54:40.800
<v Speaker 4>or another control all the various</v>
<v Speaker 4>aspects of this machine.</v>

1224
00:54:40.830 --> 00:54:42.120
<v Speaker 4>Exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

1225
00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:43.110
<v Speaker 4>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sounds good.</v>

1226
00:54:43.111 --> 00:54:43.944
<v Speaker 4>Doesn't it?</v>

1227
00:54:44.090 --> 00:54:46.460
<v Speaker 2>I believe so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1228
00:54:46.461 --> 00:54:50.130
<v Speaker 2>I hope you do because was going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be a lot of stuff.</v>

1229
00:54:50.180 --> 00:54:53.480
<v Speaker 2>I want to know what you've seen though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you've seen this piece of metal.</v>

1230
00:54:53.481 --> 00:54:56.750
<v Speaker 2>What else have you seen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen many,</v>

1231
00:54:56.751 --> 00:55:01.751
<v Speaker 2>many documents on the studies of these</v>
<v Speaker 2>things and I've seen a lot of the</v>

1232
00:55:03.711 --> 00:55:07.880
<v Speaker 2>science associated with what the</v>
<v Speaker 2>technology is and what it does.</v>

1233
00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:11.450
<v Speaker 2>Like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could show you if I fold up pieces of</v>

1234
00:55:11.451 --> 00:55:13.070
<v Speaker 2>paper and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on with it,</v>

1235
00:55:13.071 --> 00:55:14.900
<v Speaker 2>but basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1236
00:55:15.110 --> 00:55:19.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these craft know when they travel in a</v>

1237
00:55:19.431 --> 00:55:22.730
<v Speaker 2>straight line,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're folding space type in event</v>

1238
00:55:22.731 --> 00:55:26.000
<v Speaker 2>horizon where they explain it by folding</v>
<v Speaker 2>a piece of paper and punching a pencil</v>

1239
00:55:26.001 --> 00:55:27.050
<v Speaker 2>through it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You ever see that moment?</v>

1240
00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:28.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of like that movie,</v>

1241
00:55:28.580 --> 00:55:30.530
<v Speaker 2>but it's more like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1242
00:55:30.890 --> 00:55:32.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here I can draw it for you here.</v>

1243
00:55:32.630 --> 00:55:36.140
<v Speaker 2>Not that this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's Kinda like when you have two</v>

1244
00:55:36.141 --> 00:55:37.790
<v Speaker 2>points,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1245
00:55:38.150 --> 00:55:40.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're used to traveling in a direction</v>

1246
00:55:40.551 --> 00:55:42.590
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when we look up,</v>

1247
00:55:42.591 --> 00:55:44.870
<v Speaker 2>we see a plane that goes straight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1248
00:55:44.930 --> 00:55:49.930
<v Speaker 2>But these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these Ufos fold space time like this,</v>

1249
00:55:51.820 --> 00:55:54.290
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so it looks like to them they're</v>

1250
00:55:54.291 --> 00:55:58.070
<v Speaker 2>going in a straight line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you're in the ship you see that.</v>

1251
00:55:58.430 --> 00:56:00.350
<v Speaker 2>But if you're on the ground you see</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1252
00:56:01.370 --> 00:56:03.380
<v Speaker 2>That's why you see them blink off and</v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

1253
00:56:03.440 --> 00:56:06.380
<v Speaker 2>A lot of those videos they're on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looks like they're jumping.</v>

1254
00:56:06.830 --> 00:56:09.510
<v Speaker 2>It's just because of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So having space time,</v>

1255
00:56:09.560 --> 00:56:12.140
<v Speaker 4>some way of interfacing with space</v>
<v Speaker 4>itself,</v>

1256
00:56:12.141 --> 00:56:15.950
<v Speaker 4>that's very different than our idea of</v>
<v Speaker 4>traveling in a linear way from point a</v>

1257
00:56:15.951 --> 00:56:16.700
<v Speaker 4>to point b</v>

1258
00:56:16.700 --> 00:56:17.720
<v Speaker 2>space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fabric,</v>

1259
00:56:17.750 --> 00:56:20.840
<v Speaker 2>they call it the fabric of space time</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's like a fabric.</v>

1260
00:56:20.841 --> 00:56:22.280
<v Speaker 2>It's malleable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1261
00:56:22.281 --> 00:56:25.270
<v Speaker 2>let me ask you this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How often into a conversation do people</v>

1262
00:56:25.271 --> 00:56:28.240
<v Speaker 2>look at you and think you are fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy when you started talking about</v>

1263
00:56:28.241 --> 00:56:30.100
<v Speaker 2>this and how long was the time?</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the time.</v>

1264
00:56:30.101 --> 00:56:31.480
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But do you ever get to the point where</v>

1265
00:56:31.481 --> 00:56:33.490
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to talk about this because</v>

1266
00:56:33.610 --> 00:56:36.190
<v Speaker 2>it's you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always tell me,</v>

1267
00:56:36.191 --> 00:56:37.960
<v Speaker 2>you don't know what I know and there's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot.</v>

1268
00:56:38.390 --> 00:56:38.800
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1269
00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:40.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you ever get to the point where</v>

1270
00:56:40.211 --> 00:56:41.410
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't do this anymore.</v>

1271
00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:44.620
<v Speaker 2>Now people think I'm fucking crazy now</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'm involved on the most</v>

1272
00:56:44.621 --> 00:56:46.780
<v Speaker 2>important shit I've ever been in my</v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

1273
00:56:46.830 --> 00:56:49.060
<v Speaker 2>So I think this is like the most</v>
<v Speaker 2>important thing that you've ever done.</v>

1274
00:56:49.330 --> 00:56:50.390
<v Speaker 2>Fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>

1275
00:56:50.391 --> 00:56:52.750
<v Speaker 2>I have meetings with senators coming up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1276
00:56:53.150 --> 00:56:54.210
<v Speaker 2>oh fuck yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>senator.</v>

1277
00:56:54.220 --> 00:56:57.000
<v Speaker 2>So I can't tell you Dan was all this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't tell you stuff.</v>

1278
00:56:57.010 --> 00:57:00.220
<v Speaker 2>I know this is some fucking Trenton.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When is all this going to come out?</v>

1279
00:57:00.221 --> 00:57:04.600
<v Speaker 2>Like it seems like this is like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>animate eminent rather disclosure type</v>

1280
00:57:04.601 --> 00:57:06.190
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Watch what my company does.</v>

1281
00:57:06.191 --> 00:57:07.810
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'll say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what is your company?</v>

1282
00:57:08.110 --> 00:57:09.130
<v Speaker 2>What are you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you trying to do?</v>

1283
00:57:09.220 --> 00:57:10.350
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we created.</v>

1284
00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:12.350
<v Speaker 2>So if you look at the people involved,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1285
00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:16.570
<v Speaker 2>we have senior high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you get to the senior levels of</v>

1286
00:57:16.571 --> 00:57:18.820
<v Speaker 2>government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're either called an sts or six</v>

1287
00:57:18.821 --> 00:57:20.890
<v Speaker 2>senior intelligence service,</v>
<v Speaker 2>senior executive service,</v>

1288
00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:24.010
<v Speaker 2>or you're a brass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But either way the civilians have the</v>

1289
00:57:24.011 --> 00:57:27.220
<v Speaker 2>same kind of ranking charter that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>breast is.</v>

1290
00:57:27.221 --> 00:57:29.380
<v Speaker 2>So scs three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ss three,</v>

1291
00:57:29.400 --> 00:57:31.540
<v Speaker 2>one three would be the same thing as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>three star general.</v>

1292
00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:32.920
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1293
00:57:33.250 --> 00:57:34.630
<v Speaker 2>that's who these people are around me.</v>

1294
00:57:34.630 --> 00:57:36.260
<v Speaker 2>So I had the head of the skunkworks</v>
<v Speaker 2>engineering.</v>

1295
00:57:36.540 --> 00:57:37.720
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got,</v>

1296
00:57:37.810 --> 00:57:40.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a to star from the clandestine director,</v>

1297
00:57:40.870 --> 00:57:44.710
<v Speaker 2>head of operations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a guy under secretary of</v>

1298
00:57:45.240 --> 00:57:47.830
<v Speaker 2>intelligence for the Senate Intelligence</v>
<v Speaker 2>Committee and was.</v>

1299
00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:52.120
<v Speaker 2>These guys are retired that croissants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Retard calls are recorded.</v>

1300
00:57:52.121 --> 00:57:52.600
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they all,</v>

1301
00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:55.020
<v Speaker 2>they all left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are currently life.</v>

1302
00:57:55.320 --> 00:57:57.520
<v Speaker 2>They now are involved the way you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing,</v>

1303
00:57:57.550 --> 00:58:00.640
<v Speaker 2>the way they are current consultants to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Internet,</v>

1304
00:58:00.840 --> 00:58:02.340
<v Speaker 2>the intelligence community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1305
00:58:02.710 --> 00:58:06.460
<v Speaker 2>That's probably the men involved in this</v>
<v Speaker 2>project with clearance.</v>

1306
00:58:06.830 --> 00:58:10.780
<v Speaker 2>They all have their top secret SSC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I clearances.</v>

1307
00:58:10.781 --> 00:58:12.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the only one that does it on my</v>

1308
00:58:12.431 --> 00:58:14.230
<v Speaker 2>entire team.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the only one that does it.</v>

1309
00:58:14.380 --> 00:58:16.510
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lou that just came out,</v>

1310
00:58:16.511 --> 00:58:19.600
<v Speaker 2>I hired him away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he was head of all,</v>

1311
00:58:19.780 --> 00:58:23.770
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was in charge of all classified,</v>

1312
00:58:24.820 --> 00:58:28.240
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>operations for secretary of Defense</v>

1313
00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:31.210
<v Speaker 2>Mattis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he was what's called a gs 15 right</v>

1314
00:58:31.211 --> 00:58:32.980
<v Speaker 2>underneath the one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two and three stars.</v>

1315
00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:38.280
<v Speaker 2>He ran the advanced aerial fet program.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's still continuing to this day</v>

1316
00:58:38.710 --> 00:58:41.920
<v Speaker 2>and he's with us now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the advanced aerial threat program</v>

1317
00:58:41.921 --> 00:58:45.340
<v Speaker 2>under the United States government is</v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially a Ufo.</v>

1318
00:58:45.550 --> 00:58:48.880
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the minimization gathering</v>
<v Speaker 2>assessment,</v>

1319
00:58:48.881 --> 00:58:53.881
<v Speaker 2>assessment of all of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of what those machines are doing that</v>

1320
00:58:55.001 --> 00:58:59.590
<v Speaker 2>gives off all these types of effects</v>
<v Speaker 2>that people are witnessing.</v>

1321
00:58:59.620 --> 00:59:04.090
<v Speaker 2>But there's also a very large group of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that have had within government</v>

1322
00:59:04.091 --> 00:59:08.170
<v Speaker 2>that I've had close contact like</v>
<v Speaker 2>hundreds and it's connected to my group</v>

1323
00:59:08.230 --> 00:59:10.090
<v Speaker 2>and there's just more coming in that</v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

1324
00:59:10.091 --> 00:59:15.091
<v Speaker 2>So that program is trying to figure out</v>
<v Speaker 2>what those technologies did to those</v>

1325
00:59:15.971 --> 00:59:20.971
<v Speaker 2>people and how those technologies work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even though it's</v>

1326
00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:24.380
<v Speaker 1>more saddle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more about tasking,</v>

1327
00:59:24.710 --> 00:59:27.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our assets like satellites and other</v>

1328
00:59:27.231 --> 00:59:29.360
<v Speaker 1>things to be able to find these things</v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

1329
00:59:29.720 --> 00:59:33.770
<v Speaker 1>But this is different than the secret</v>
<v Speaker 1>machines book,</v>

1330
00:59:33.771 --> 00:59:38.480
<v Speaker 1>which is more of another thing also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there communication between the</v>

1331
00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:40.250
<v Speaker 1>United States government and alien</v>
<v Speaker 1>lifeforms?</v>

1332
00:59:40.520 --> 00:59:42.260
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I personally,</v>

1333
00:59:42.590 --> 00:59:43.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know any of this stuff,</v>

1334
00:59:43.990 --> 00:59:46.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm not invited to those types</v>

1335
00:59:46.071 --> 00:59:48.320
<v Speaker 1>of meetings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I personally wouldn't doubt it.</v>

1336
00:59:48.380 --> 00:59:49.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't doubt it,</v>

1337
00:59:49.461 --> 00:59:52.940
<v Speaker 1>but they've never alluded to it or</v>
<v Speaker 1>discussed it with you in any way.</v>

1338
00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:54.680
<v Speaker 1>Not the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not this group of people know.</v>

1339
00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:57.380
<v Speaker 1>Is there any speculation as to what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing?</v>

1340
00:59:58.130 --> 01:00:00.560
<v Speaker 1>Resource extraction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>resource extraction,</v>

1341
01:00:00.561 --> 01:00:02.600
<v Speaker 1>like are like minerals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>empire building.</v>

1342
01:00:02.601 --> 01:00:04.340
<v Speaker 1>I tell people that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are the eggs the.</v>

1343
01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:05.890
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's changed.</v>

1344
01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:09.470
<v Speaker 1>I think it's Tacos think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1345
01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:10.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're here for the same reason I am,</v>

1346
01:00:10.881 --> 01:00:12.150
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1347
01:00:12.290 --> 01:00:14.990
<v Speaker 1>I tell people like a good way to look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is like,</v>

1348
01:00:14.991 --> 01:00:19.850
<v Speaker 1>look at Syria and Syria is in chaos</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the United States and Russia are</v>

1349
01:00:19.851 --> 01:00:21.170
<v Speaker 1>having a proxy war there.</v>

1350
01:00:21.650 --> 01:00:23.960
<v Speaker 1>Now look at the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the exact same thing.</v>

1351
01:00:24.770 --> 01:00:29.000
<v Speaker 1>Different races are coming here and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're trying to win.</v>

1352
01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:33.280
<v Speaker 1>And one the universe we're talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

1353
01:00:33.610 --> 01:00:34.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1354
01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:36.830
<v Speaker 1>but there's a bunch of different</v>
<v Speaker 1>creatures and they all have the same</v>

1355
01:00:36.831 --> 01:00:38.780
<v Speaker 1>sort of technology on summer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very human.</v>

1356
01:00:38.810 --> 01:00:41.090
<v Speaker 1>Some are looked just like you and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>

1357
01:00:41.150 --> 01:00:42.020
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1358
01:00:43.890 --> 01:00:46.010
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there any sort of speculation as to</v>

1359
01:00:46.011 --> 01:00:49.880
<v Speaker 1>why life forms from other planets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other galaxies of the solar systems,</v>

1360
01:00:49.940 --> 01:00:52.430
<v Speaker 1>different kind of gravity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different environments would create a</v>

1361
01:00:52.431 --> 01:00:57.431
<v Speaker 1>life form that's exactly similar to us</v>
<v Speaker 1>or are they imitating what we look like</v>

1362
01:00:57.441 --> 01:01:01.070
<v Speaker 1>in order to infiltrate our world and</v>
<v Speaker 1>hang with us?</v>

1363
01:01:01.100 --> 01:01:03.860
<v Speaker 1>I think probably all knowing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think all the above.</v>

1364
01:01:03.861 --> 01:01:04.341
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1365
01:01:04.341 --> 01:01:07.840
<v Speaker 1>if you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at Syria or are you just</v>

1366
01:01:07.850 --> 01:01:09.980
<v Speaker 1>going to say it's only Russia and</v>
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>

1367
01:01:09.981 --> 01:01:12.170
<v Speaker 1>they're trying is probably there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Francis probably there,</v>

1368
01:01:12.490 --> 01:01:13.320
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1369
01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:14.380
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1370
01:01:14.390 --> 01:01:17.570
<v Speaker 1>I personally think the little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the little aliens with the big black</v>

1371
01:01:17.571 --> 01:01:19.220
<v Speaker 1>eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are androids,</v>

1372
01:01:19.221 --> 01:01:21.710
<v Speaker 1>their biological robots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just programmed.</v>

1373
01:01:21.740 --> 01:01:23.540
<v Speaker 1>There's no different than us cloning</v>
<v Speaker 1>sheep.</v>

1374
01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:27.520
<v Speaker 1>They just clone a being that can travel</v>
<v Speaker 1>through space because space is sort of</v>

1375
01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:30.530
<v Speaker 1>artificial intelligence thing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have a life form.</v>

1376
01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:33.690
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard that idea before and it Kinda</v>

1377
01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:35.420
<v Speaker 1>kinda makes sense a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1378
01:01:35.421 --> 01:01:36.254
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

1379
01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:39.890
<v Speaker 1>if you're a living thing and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>traveling through space,</v>

1380
01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:44.210
<v Speaker 1>obviously a biological limitations in</v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of the need for oxygen and</v>

1381
01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:48.470
<v Speaker 1>gravitational interactions and all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>different things that one of the</v>

1382
01:01:48.510 --> 01:01:52.190
<v Speaker 1>scariest hallmarks of those ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the room or is it in the back of their</v>

1383
01:01:52.191 --> 01:01:54.860
<v Speaker 1>head as a transmitter?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you gotta wonder where it's sending</v>

1384
01:01:54.861 --> 01:01:56.630
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time,</v>

1385
01:01:56.690 --> 01:01:58.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you that when you look at the</v>

1386
01:01:58.611 --> 01:01:59.970
<v Speaker 1>Bible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1387
01:02:00.050 --> 01:02:03.770
<v Speaker 1>the angels and the demons of the Bible</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be the humans and the androids</v>

1388
01:02:04.190 --> 01:02:07.670
<v Speaker 1>that I just told you about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you think the grades of the Androids,</v>

1389
01:02:07.671 --> 01:02:09.110
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you think there like some sort of</v>

1390
01:02:09.111 --> 01:02:10.070
<v Speaker 1>devil?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1391
01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:14.420
<v Speaker 1>I just think that that's how we</v>
<v Speaker 1>characterized it because they come in</v>

1392
01:02:14.421 --> 01:02:15.890
<v Speaker 1>and control your thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Control your body.</v>

<v Speaker 2>from where?</v>

1397
01:02:22.620 --> 01:02:25.080
<v Speaker 2>Do we have any idea?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's things that have been put out</v>

<v Speaker 2>kid,</v>

1449
01:04:30.721 --> 01:04:33.750
<v Speaker 2>but I read a lot about Greek mythology</v>
<v Speaker 2>and looked me in the.</v>

1450
01:04:33.751 --> 01:04:34.201
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1456
01:04:46.321 --> 01:04:48.360
<v Speaker 2>insert something about Greek mythology?</v>

01:06:16.570 --> 01:06:19.000
<v Speaker 1>There's mathematics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>astronomy and all this different shit.</v>

1493
01:06:19.001 --> 01:06:21.550
<v Speaker 1>They knew all the planets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They said there was an extra planet,</v>

1494
01:06:21.820 --> 01:06:24.700
<v Speaker 1>but Zacharias was the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was the one that really spent a lot of</v>

1495
01:06:24.701 --> 01:06:26.210
<v Speaker 1>time doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's,</v>

1496
01:06:26.290 --> 01:06:29.680
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of other scholars that</v>
<v Speaker 1>disagree now he can say,</v>

1497
01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:31.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in those texts is the,</v>

1498
01:06:31.661 --> 01:06:35.200
<v Speaker 1>is the story of the garden of Eden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the flood of Noah,</v>

1499
01:06:35.230 --> 01:06:39.070
<v Speaker 1>like all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But his take on it was those who from</v>

1500
01:06:39.071 --> 01:06:41.620
<v Speaker 1>heaven to earth came called the main</v>
<v Speaker 1>jewels,</v>

1501
01:06:41.650 --> 01:06:45.220
<v Speaker 1>but they were an advanced race.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They fucked around with genetics.</v>

1502
01:06:45.221 --> 01:06:49.350
<v Speaker 1>Well that was the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his take on the definition of Nephilim</v>

1503
01:06:49.540 --> 01:06:50.880
<v Speaker 1>was the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was the nephew.</v>

1504
01:06:50.881 --> 01:06:51.714
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you find them.</v>

1505
01:06:51.940 --> 01:06:53.620
<v Speaker 1>You find that in genesis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Nephilim.</v>

1506
01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:55.310
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1507
01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:58.060
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was able to tell a really interesting</v>

1508
01:06:58.061 --> 01:07:02.860
<v Speaker 1>story based on these texts and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some people don't agree with them,</v>

1509
01:07:02.861 --> 01:07:04.240
<v Speaker 1>but at the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the end of the day,</v>

1510
01:07:04.510 --> 01:07:07.660
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the closest thing we got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in my early conversations when I</v>

1511
01:07:07.661 --> 01:07:10.330
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was being given some interesting</v>

1512
01:07:10.331 --> 01:07:13.150
<v Speaker 1>science fiction stuff for my book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1513
01:07:13.151 --> 01:07:17.640
<v Speaker 1>the Greek mythology part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I brought up the Sumerians and they</v>

1514
01:07:17.710 --> 01:07:20.680
<v Speaker 1>showed me one particular king.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They said this,</v>

1515
01:07:20.710 --> 01:07:23.410
<v Speaker 1>we find this one very interesting and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't remember his name,</v>

1516
01:07:23.411 --> 01:07:25.780
<v Speaker 1>but it fired so quick when I asked the</v>
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>

1517
01:07:26.140 --> 01:07:28.030
<v Speaker 1>It came right back with this whole thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>on this one,</v>

1518
01:07:28.031 --> 01:07:30.040
<v Speaker 1>Sumerian king.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really interesting.</v>

1519
01:07:30.430 --> 01:07:32.530
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's fascinating about them is that</v>

1520
01:07:32.531 --> 01:07:35.020
<v Speaker 1>they really did know a lot about our</v>
<v Speaker 1>solar system.</v>

1521
01:07:35.021 --> 01:07:38.170
<v Speaker 1>Can you think about the fact that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were around 5,000 years ago,</v>

1522
01:07:38.171 --> 01:07:42.460
<v Speaker 1>they had a detailed model of the solar</v>
<v Speaker 1>system with all of the planets and they</v>

1523
01:07:42.461 --> 01:07:44.650
<v Speaker 1>were all relatively close in size.</v>

1524
01:07:44.650 --> 01:07:47.680
<v Speaker 1>This is a clay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of those clay cylinders that you</v>

1525
01:07:47.681 --> 01:07:50.360
<v Speaker 1>would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you would do is you would put out a</v>

1526
01:07:50.380 --> 01:07:54.400
<v Speaker 1>flat piece of clay and you would roll</v>
<v Speaker 1>this cylinder over it and that's how</v>

1527
01:07:54.401 --> 01:07:55.780
<v Speaker 1>they would print things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

1528
01:07:56.020 --> 01:08:01.020
<v Speaker 1>And this and this really sort of kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>primitive way of doing this.</v>

1529
01:08:01.660 --> 01:08:04.090
<v Speaker 1>Somehow or another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they knew a lot about astronomy.</v>

1530
01:08:04.580 --> 01:08:06.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they knew about the structure of our</v>

1531
01:08:06.431 --> 01:08:08.320
<v Speaker 1>solar system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They knew where the planets were,</v>

1532
01:08:08.530 --> 01:08:08.951
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1533
01:08:08.951 --> 01:08:13.951
<v Speaker 1>you gotta remember Galileo was almost</v>
<v Speaker 1>killed and confined to his house house</v>

1534
01:08:13.961 --> 01:08:16.160
<v Speaker 1>arrest because he said that the</v>

1535
01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:19.880
<v Speaker 4>universe doesn't revolve around us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We revolve around the sun and that was</v>

1536
01:08:19.881 --> 01:08:23.210
<v Speaker 4>way after.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's for 5,000 years after the</v>

1537
01:08:23.211 --> 01:08:25.550
<v Speaker 4>seminarians that already knew that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1538
01:08:25.580 --> 01:08:28.160
<v Speaker 4>we weren't the center of the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's interesting.</v>

1539
01:08:28.161 --> 01:08:31.430
<v Speaker 4>We were really smart and then we went</v>
<v Speaker 4>backwards.</v>

1540
01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:33.980
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there's probably a bit more to that</v>

1541
01:08:33.981 --> 01:08:36.140
<v Speaker 4>story too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that hopefully one day we'll get into</v>

1542
01:08:36.141 --> 01:08:36.891
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1543
01:08:36.891 --> 01:08:39.350
<v Speaker 4>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's really interesting when you look at</v>

1544
01:08:39.351 --> 01:08:43.490
<v Speaker 4>these ancient civilizations and their</v>
<v Speaker 4>attempts to decipher the world around</v>

1545
01:08:43.491 --> 01:08:46.100
<v Speaker 4>them and you try to figure out what did</v>
<v Speaker 4>they know?</v>

1546
01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:48.680
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how much did they know that the</v>

1547
01:08:48.770 --> 01:08:51.350
<v Speaker 4>Sumerians or one of the more interesting</v>
<v Speaker 4>cases to me,</v>

1548
01:08:51.530 --> 01:08:55.700
<v Speaker 4>because of the fact that they had this</v>
<v Speaker 4>really bizarre map of the solar system</v>

1549
01:08:56.210 --> 01:08:57.890
<v Speaker 4>when we didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

1550
01:08:57.891 --> 01:09:00.680
<v Speaker 4>they found out about Pluto.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They had a,</v>

1551
01:09:00.700 --> 01:09:04.850
<v Speaker 4>an image of Pluto and I don't think we</v>
<v Speaker 4>found out about Pluto until like the</v>

1552
01:09:04.851 --> 01:09:06.080
<v Speaker 4>early 19 hundreds.</v>

1553
01:09:06.140 --> 01:09:09.620
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Pluto might've even been like 15 or</v>

1554
01:09:09.621 --> 01:09:10.940
<v Speaker 4>16.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can find that out.</v>

1555
01:09:11.210 --> 01:09:14.780
<v Speaker 4>Pluto was found like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like not even that long ago.</v>

1556
01:09:14.781 --> 01:09:17.300
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it was as far back as</v>
<v Speaker 4>the night to see if you could find that</v>

1557
01:09:17.301 --> 01:09:21.050
<v Speaker 4>out and then find the image of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>Annunaki when they show the solar</v>

1558
01:09:21.051 --> 01:09:23.300
<v Speaker 4>system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because the image is really fascinating</v>

1559
01:09:23.330 --> 01:09:25.040
<v Speaker 4>because it is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1560
01:09:25.041 --> 01:09:26.650
<v Speaker 4>you look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a son.</v>

1561
01:09:27.140 --> 01:09:29.380
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's clearly a son.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It has like a,</v>

1562
01:09:29.410 --> 01:09:33.050
<v Speaker 4>it's a large circle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's in the sky and it has those little</v>

1563
01:09:33.051 --> 01:09:36.060
<v Speaker 4>son sort of raise around this picture,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1564
01:09:36.070 --> 01:09:38.180
<v Speaker 4>Because yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the picture.</v>

1565
01:09:38.210 --> 01:09:39.940
<v Speaker 4>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So do you know they,</v>

1566
01:09:39.941 --> 01:09:43.220
<v Speaker 4>they have an idea of where to look for</v>
<v Speaker 4>this extra planet.</v>

1567
01:09:43.221 --> 01:09:46.760
<v Speaker 4>They thought in the early nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 4>jpl announced that they thought they</v>

1568
01:09:46.761 --> 01:09:48.380
<v Speaker 4>found a companion to our son.</v>

1569
01:09:48.530 --> 01:09:50.750
<v Speaker 4>He'll look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's fucking radical right</v>

1570
01:09:50.751 --> 01:09:51.380
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1571
01:09:51.380 --> 01:09:53.630
<v Speaker 4>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have pluto in there now.</v>

1572
01:09:53.631 --> 01:09:57.710
<v Speaker 4>Go to the discovery of Pluto when we</v>
<v Speaker 4>went to Pluto,</v>

1573
01:09:57.711 --> 01:09:58.760
<v Speaker 4>get discovered.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you're right.</v>

1574
01:09:58.761 --> 01:10:01.420
<v Speaker 4>I think it wasn't the 19 fifties.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know it was sometime in the 19th.</v>

1575
01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:03.890
<v Speaker 4>I'm talking about Disney's Pluto,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which means 30,</v>

1576
01:10:04.630 --> 01:10:05.510
<v Speaker 4>19,</v>
<v Speaker 4>30.</v>

1577
01:10:05.570 --> 01:10:06.980
<v Speaker 4>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Crazy shit.</v>

1578
01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:09.470
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So these people somehow or another new</v>

1579
01:10:09.471 --> 01:10:14.471
<v Speaker 4>about Pluto fuck in way before us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this is not something you could see</v>

1580
01:10:14.871 --> 01:10:17.950
<v Speaker 4>with the naked eye.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So somehow or another and ignore where</v>

1581
01:10:17.951 --> 01:10:19.910
<v Speaker 4>there's other planets.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you could see a few of them.</v>

1582
01:10:19.911 --> 01:10:22.250
<v Speaker 4>You could see Mars and sometimes you</v>
<v Speaker 4>could see Jupiter,</v>

1583
01:10:22.870 --> 01:10:23.960
<v Speaker 4>maybe Saturn,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1584
01:10:24.710 --> 01:10:28.120
<v Speaker 4>Saturn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are the ones you can see Saturn and</v>

1585
01:10:28.850 --> 01:10:31.010
<v Speaker 4>after that they had uranus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't see.</v>

1586
01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:33.950
<v Speaker 4>It's just the other one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Time have,</v>

1587
01:10:34.190 --> 01:10:36.860
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every 25 years you can barely see it</v>

1588
01:10:36.861 --> 01:10:39.320
<v Speaker 4>with the naked eye we were in last week</v>
<v Speaker 4>or something like that.</v>

1589
01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:43.370
<v Speaker 4>You were at Griffith Observatory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like super crowded because of</v>

1590
01:10:43.371 --> 01:10:44.670
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or we're not gonna we're not gonna.</v>

1591
01:10:44.671 --> 01:10:46.100
<v Speaker 4>Make jokes and shit about your anus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1592
01:10:46.101 --> 01:10:47.430
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's so old.</v>

1593
01:10:49.010 --> 01:10:50.420
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And were they looking at it with the</v>

1594
01:10:50.421 --> 01:10:55.070
<v Speaker 4>naked eye or with telescope?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like you could observed because</v>

1595
01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:57.170
<v Speaker 4>everyone goes there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a bunch of telescopes already</v>

1596
01:10:57.171 --> 01:10:59.180
<v Speaker 4>set up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that makes sense for telescopes.</v>

1597
01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:02.430
<v Speaker 4>But why would the naked eye.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's one of the best places closest to</v>

1598
01:11:02.431 --> 01:11:05.250
<v Speaker 4>la or I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1599
01:11:05.251 --> 01:11:08.030
<v Speaker 4>La is weird because of the light</v>
<v Speaker 4>pollution right now.</v>

1600
01:11:08.031 --> 01:11:09.790
<v Speaker 4>It's so it's a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why,</v>

1601
01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:12.170
<v Speaker 4>you know when you go to the desert and</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's beautiful and I'm like Whoa,</v>

1602
01:11:12.460 --> 01:11:13.770
<v Speaker 4>that's you releasing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was last week,</v>

1603
01:11:13.830 --> 01:11:14.190
<v Speaker 4>October</v>

1604
01:11:14.190 --> 01:11:15.680
<v Speaker 1>19th.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could see with your naked eye that</v>

1605
01:11:15.700 --> 01:11:16.730
<v Speaker 1>urine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the secret to a unit.</v>

1606
01:11:17.070 --> 01:11:18.630
<v Speaker 1>You guys are talking about naked in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uranus.</v>

1607
01:11:18.780 --> 01:11:20.610
<v Speaker 1>A lot here and I don't want to make any</v>
<v Speaker 1>jokes.</v>

1608
01:11:20.611 --> 01:11:21.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm just telling you what you're</v>

1609
01:11:21.781 --> 01:11:24.300
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See your anus with your naked eye this</v>

1610
01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:25.380
<v Speaker 1>week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Giggle if you must.</v>

1611
01:11:27.290 --> 01:11:29.420
<v Speaker 1>What a goofy name too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

1612
01:11:29.580 --> 01:11:32.760
<v Speaker 1>All the different sounds you can make</v>
<v Speaker 1>with your face and they chose your</v>

1613
01:11:32.850 --> 01:11:34.830
<v Speaker 1>buddle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if they just call it buddle?</v>

1614
01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:36.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Butthole planet butthole.</v>

1615
01:11:36.450 --> 01:11:39.600
<v Speaker 1>It'd be just as weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking crazy.</v>

1616
01:11:39.601 --> 01:11:42.340
<v Speaker 1>Fast be the first place I go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be the first place you've</v>

1617
01:11:42.350 --> 01:11:43.590
<v Speaker 1>visited the planet buddle?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1618
01:11:44.130 --> 01:11:46.290
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that there's life in our</v>
<v Speaker 1>solar system?</v>

1619
01:11:46.380 --> 01:11:47.940
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where do you think it is?</v>

1620
01:11:48.150 --> 01:11:49.560
<v Speaker 1>Europa?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1621
01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:52.560
<v Speaker 1>So you think there's some sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>primitive life form that's under the</v>

1622
01:11:52.561 --> 01:11:52.890
<v Speaker 1>ice?</v>

1623
01:11:52.890 --> 01:11:56.670
<v Speaker 1>I think there's life on Mars and I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a little start from.</v>

1624
01:11:56.680 --> 01:12:00.090
<v Speaker 1>I think there's life on Mars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's small little animals in</v>

1625
01:12:00.150 --> 01:12:04.350
<v Speaker 1>microbial or or insects shit that's kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of learning how to live with it's</v>

1626
01:12:04.351 --> 01:12:07.530
<v Speaker 1>radioactive environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which by the way,</v>

1627
01:12:07.620 --> 01:12:12.620
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of scientists from jpl found</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there was some atomic weapons that</v>

1628
01:12:14.011 --> 01:12:16.820
<v Speaker 1>went off on Mars because the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1629
01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:21.880
<v Speaker 1>the radioactive signature is can only</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen if you explode a nuclear weapon.</v>

1630
01:12:22.801 --> 01:12:24.450
<v Speaker 1>That's artificially made,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not like a,</v>

1631
01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:27.900
<v Speaker 1>like something that happens naturally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a moon exploding on the surface.</v>

1632
01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:31.080
<v Speaker 1>So it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you read that.</v>

1633
01:12:31.230 --> 01:12:33.270
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's been all over the place.</v>

1634
01:12:33.271 --> 01:12:34.890
<v Speaker 1>I forgot the guy's name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The doctor's name.</v>

1635
01:12:34.891 --> 01:12:36.150
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a,</v>

1636
01:12:36.450 --> 01:12:39.960
<v Speaker 1>he actually was one of the lead</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientists on a clementine mission which</v>

1637
01:12:39.961 --> 01:12:42.120
<v Speaker 1>was mapping the moon with jpl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's a,</v>

1638
01:12:42.121 --> 01:12:42.954
<v Speaker 1>he's a big time dude.</v>

1639
01:12:44.130 --> 01:12:47.050
<v Speaker 1>And he thinks there was nuclear war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huge.</v>

1640
01:12:47.100 --> 01:12:48.090
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't say that.</v>

1641
01:12:48.091 --> 01:12:52.890
<v Speaker 1>He just says that nuclear weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just says we have this signature.</v>

1642
01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:57.920
<v Speaker 1>He all peer reviewed science that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>signature of the radioactive activity</v>

1643
01:12:58.741 --> 01:13:03.510
<v Speaker 1>from this very specific isotope that</v>
<v Speaker 1>only comes from artificial nuclear</v>

1644
01:13:03.511 --> 01:13:05.130
<v Speaker 1>explosion or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit,</v>

1645
01:13:05.190 --> 01:13:06.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to mess with something</v>
<v Speaker 1>along those lines.</v>

1646
01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:09.030
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd heard before that they thought that</v>

1647
01:13:09.031 --> 01:13:12.810
<v Speaker 1>somehow or another Mars was impacted</v>
<v Speaker 1>that something hit it like some sort of</v>

1648
01:13:12.811 --> 01:13:15.090
<v Speaker 1>Rasta oil impact and it destroyed the</v>
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>

1649
01:13:15.091 --> 01:13:17.940
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you type in nuclear weapon Mars or</v>

1650
01:13:17.941 --> 01:13:20.190
<v Speaker 1>nukes on Mars or some shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll find it.</v>

1651
01:13:20.230 --> 01:13:22.470
<v Speaker 1>You go to Richard Hoagland site,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hoagland.</v>

1652
01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:25.050
<v Speaker 1>He kind of disappeared though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1653
01:13:25.051 --> 01:13:27.290
<v Speaker 1>That guy was wacky as fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he,</v>

1654
01:13:27.300 --> 01:13:31.740
<v Speaker 1>he was one of the WHO's the one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>main proponents of the face on Mars and</v>

1655
01:13:31.741 --> 01:13:33.630
<v Speaker 1>all the pyramids that they found on</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mars.</v>

1656
01:13:33.630 --> 01:13:37.830
<v Speaker 1>They would find these weird connections</v>
<v Speaker 1>chain one point to another point and</v>

1657
01:13:37.831 --> 01:13:40.710
<v Speaker 1>somehow or another they made some</v>
<v Speaker 1>arbitrary distinctions that those were</v>

1658
01:13:41.130 --> 01:13:45.270
<v Speaker 1>indicative of intelligent design.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Elon musk wanted to drop nukes up there</v>

1659
01:13:45.271 --> 01:13:46.380
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good move.</v>

1660
01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:50.150
<v Speaker 1>Elan Musk elaborates proposal to nuke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maurice,</v>

1661
01:13:50.190 --> 01:13:52.150
<v Speaker 1>how's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Picture is not.</v>

1662
01:13:52.470 --> 01:13:54.570
<v Speaker 1>He's probably bored.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He put on his instagram last night.</v>

1663
01:13:54.571 --> 01:13:57.540
<v Speaker 1>He was a cooking hot dogs and</v>
<v Speaker 1>marshmallows and singing along with</v>

1664
01:13:57.541 --> 01:14:00.540
<v Speaker 1>Johnny cash drinking whiskey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what he should be fucking</v>

1665
01:14:00.541 --> 01:14:01.750
<v Speaker 1>scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1666
01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:04.500
<v Speaker 1>That's Elon Musk for president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll vote for you buddy.</v>

1667
01:14:04.830 --> 01:14:06.090
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's do it.</v>

1668
01:14:06.380 --> 01:14:08.910
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you talk to him and he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>already got space x once you guys</v>

1669
01:14:09.100 --> 01:14:10.830
<v Speaker 1>collaborated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second thing we're doing,</v>

1670
01:14:10.831 --> 01:14:12.280
<v Speaker 1>he might really actually be interested</v>

1671
01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:14.380
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the two aerospace projects to the</v>

1672
01:14:14.381 --> 01:14:17.680
<v Speaker 2>stars is doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is we're building something that</v>

1673
01:14:17.681 --> 01:14:20.440
<v Speaker 2>will in effect be anti gravity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's actually,</v>

1674
01:14:20.441 --> 01:14:22.180
<v Speaker 2>that's actually not the mechanism it</v>
<v Speaker 2>does.</v>

1675
01:14:22.540 --> 01:14:23.890
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and building a spacecraft,</v>

1676
01:14:23.891 --> 01:14:26.260
<v Speaker 2>but the second thing that we're doing is</v>
<v Speaker 2>called beamed energy propulsion,</v>

1677
01:14:26.261 --> 01:14:28.630
<v Speaker 2>which is something I think musk will be</v>
<v Speaker 2>very interested in.</v>

1678
01:14:28.631 --> 01:14:31.570
<v Speaker 2>It's launching cubesats with lasers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1679
01:14:31.571 --> 01:14:33.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the air force research lab kind of broke</v>

1680
01:14:33.910 --> 01:14:38.530
<v Speaker 2>the science back in the nineties and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch of people associated with that</v>

1681
01:14:38.531 --> 01:14:42.910
<v Speaker 2>program got it declassified and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>working for us on building it.</v>

1682
01:14:42.911 --> 01:14:47.410
<v Speaker 2>So it'll take a handful of years to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what you do is you use very strong,</v>

1683
01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:52.000
<v Speaker 2>either microwaves or some other kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>wave and it ignites and explodes the air</v>

1684
01:14:52.001 --> 01:14:54.400
<v Speaker 2>underneath a mechanism that carries a</v>
<v Speaker 2>cube set.</v>

1685
01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:59.880
<v Speaker 2>And so essentially what happens is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is you don't use any fossil fuels and it</v>

1686
01:14:59.921 --> 01:15:03.430
<v Speaker 2>can bring the cost of launching a cube</v>
<v Speaker 2>sat from like 50 grand down to five</v>

1687
01:15:03.431 --> 01:15:04.570
<v Speaker 2>grand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like crazy.</v>

1688
01:15:04.571 --> 01:15:09.571
<v Speaker 2>So that means colleges and neighbors and</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone else can launch cube sats quite</v>

1689
01:15:10.121 --> 01:15:10.590
<v Speaker 2>easily.</v>

1690
01:15:10.590 --> 01:15:12.390
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have you had any debates with people</v>

1691
01:15:12.391 --> 01:15:13.720
<v Speaker 4>about this stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you ever like,</v>

1692
01:15:13.890 --> 01:15:17.130
<v Speaker 4>had someone who thinks that this is all</v>
<v Speaker 4>nonsense and sat down with you,</v>

1693
01:15:17.140 --> 01:15:22.140
<v Speaker 4>understands physics and understands</v>
<v Speaker 4>rocket propulsion space and elements.</v>

1694
01:15:23.041 --> 01:15:23.750
<v Speaker 4>And all that shit.</v>

1695
01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:25.380
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no I haven't.</v>

1696
01:15:25.390 --> 01:15:27.060
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't be able to debate a</v>
<v Speaker 2>physicist,</v>

1697
01:15:27.061 --> 01:15:28.470
<v Speaker 2>but they can read all the papers.</v>

1698
01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:29.801
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I mean,</v>

1699
01:15:29.801 --> 01:15:31.430
<v Speaker 4>is anybody been skeptical?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Zara.</v>

1700
01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:32.760
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone's skeptical.</v>

1701
01:15:32.780 --> 01:15:34.890
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what's your response to that?</v>

1702
01:15:35.250 --> 01:15:36.960
<v Speaker 4>You don't know what I know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1703
01:15:36.961 --> 01:15:38.100
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you know though?</v>

1704
01:15:38.190 --> 01:15:40.650
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't tell you some of the shit that I</v>

1705
01:15:40.651 --> 01:15:44.280
<v Speaker 4>know and I can't tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what could it be that so crazy if</v>

1706
01:15:44.281 --> 01:15:45.150
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'd know.</v>

1707
01:15:45.210 --> 01:15:46.230
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you've said,</v>

1708
01:15:46.650 --> 01:15:50.010
<v Speaker 4>we'll think about what you've said.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You said that there's some ridiculous</v>

1709
01:15:50.011 --> 01:15:55.011
<v Speaker 4>sorta propulsion system that allows you</v>
<v Speaker 4>to move through time that they,</v>

1710
01:15:55.110 --> 01:16:00.110
<v Speaker 4>they visit this planet all the time and</v>
<v Speaker 4>extract resources that there's people in</v>

1711
01:16:01.681 --> 01:16:04.110
<v Speaker 4>the government that are trying to</v>
<v Speaker 4>disseminate this information,</v>

1712
01:16:04.111 --> 01:16:06.330
<v Speaker 4>but they don't know how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't have the right vehicle to do</v>

1713
01:16:06.331 --> 01:16:08.130
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're doing it in these sort of</v>

1714
01:16:08.131 --> 01:16:11.220
<v Speaker 4>controlled chunks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Think of all these things that you've</v>

1715
01:16:11.221 --> 01:16:12.750
<v Speaker 4>said.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What could possibly be crazier than</v>

1716
01:16:12.751 --> 01:16:14.190
<v Speaker 4>that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1717
01:16:14.191 --> 01:16:16.220
<v Speaker 4>you're asking me how do I know and.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1718
01:16:16.221 --> 01:16:16.500
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1719
01:16:16.500 --> 01:16:17.281
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm asking you,</v>

1720
01:16:17.281 --> 01:16:20.130
<v Speaker 4>what do you know that could possibly be</v>
<v Speaker 4>crazier than that?</v>

1721
01:16:20.620 --> 01:16:22.290
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that's the Shit I can't tell you.</v>

1722
01:16:22.820 --> 01:16:24.600
<v Speaker 4>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything's Hunky Dory.</v>

1723
01:16:24.660 --> 01:16:27.360
<v Speaker 4>Is it something where you worried about</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fate of the human race?</v>

1724
01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:29.700
<v Speaker 4>I think that's part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where should I move?</v>

1725
01:16:30.030 --> 01:16:31.810
<v Speaker 4>I was going to move.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not existential.</v>

1726
01:16:31.811 --> 01:16:33.300
<v Speaker 4>If your dick out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I should go to Australia.</v>

1727
01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:39.250
<v Speaker 2>How about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how about I just get down in Australia.</v>

1728
01:16:40.390 --> 01:16:42.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean where's the spot?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there is one</v>

1729
01:16:42.791 --> 01:16:44.230
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Spot they just get this.</v>

1730
01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:47.380
<v Speaker 2>This is what I will say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not existential in the sense of</v>

1731
01:16:47.660 --> 01:16:50.140
<v Speaker 2>they're not gonna come here like</v>
<v Speaker 2>independence day in nuke the place.</v>

1732
01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:51.800
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>

1733
01:16:51.870 --> 01:16:52.760
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1734
01:16:52.770 --> 01:16:55.750
<v Speaker 2>there are things to worry about and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why I think</v>

1735
01:16:56.540 --> 01:16:58.130
<v Speaker 4>anybody that's famous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's an alien.</v>

1736
01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:00.020
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1737
01:17:00.020 --> 01:17:03.620
<v Speaker 4>Do you think there's any influential</v>
<v Speaker 4>figure that has been sort of shaping</v>

1738
01:17:03.621 --> 01:17:06.560
<v Speaker 4>culture that might not be one of us?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oprah,</v>

1739
01:17:07.370 --> 01:17:08.810
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It has to be Oprah.</v>

1740
01:17:08.870 --> 01:17:10.370
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you go back to the early days</v>

1741
01:17:10.370 --> 01:17:11.780
<v Speaker 1>when Oprah says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do that stupid show,</v>

1742
01:17:11.781 --> 01:17:15.590
<v Speaker 1>we should have like KKK members on and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody sat on white plastic seats.</v>

1743
01:17:15.770 --> 01:17:18.140
<v Speaker 1>Remember those days or that Geraldo?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that Oprah,</v>

1744
01:17:18.141 --> 01:17:19.310
<v Speaker 1>Oprah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or early days?</v>

1745
01:17:19.311 --> 01:17:20.600
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>me and Al Magical.</v>

1746
01:17:20.601 --> 01:17:24.070
<v Speaker 1>I'll never forget this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like when I first met owl,</v>

1747
01:17:24.150 --> 01:17:29.150
<v Speaker 1>probably like late nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we were in San Francisco doing</v>

1748
01:17:29.691 --> 01:17:33.830
<v Speaker 1>bong hits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching TV and oprah was on and it was</v>

1749
01:17:33.831 --> 01:17:36.210
<v Speaker 1>old oprah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oprah,</v>

1750
01:17:37.310 --> 01:17:40.290
<v Speaker 1>oprah might not have been the nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>might have been early 2000 of aliens</v>

1751
01:17:40.310 --> 01:17:42.120
<v Speaker 1>from men in black.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were watching at the beginning,</v>

1752
01:17:42.121 --> 01:17:43.020
<v Speaker 1>remember?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1753
01:17:44.180 --> 01:17:44.931
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1754
01:17:44.931 --> 01:17:45.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1755
01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:48.620
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's elements of this subject that</v>

1756
01:17:48.621 --> 01:17:50.920
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are disturbing and you know,</v>

1757
01:17:50.921 --> 01:17:52.550
<v Speaker 1>I don't think people need to know all</v>
<v Speaker 1>that shit.</v>

1758
01:17:52.580 --> 01:17:56.690
<v Speaker 1>So do you subscribe to the idea that</v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings are the product of genetic</v>

1759
01:17:56.691 --> 01:17:57.920
<v Speaker 1>engineering?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

1760
01:17:58.020 --> 01:17:59.990
<v Speaker 1>You do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you think that they took some lower</v>

1761
01:17:59.991 --> 01:18:04.250
<v Speaker 1>hominids and that they did something to</v>
<v Speaker 1>them to create human beings?</v>

1762
01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:07.280
<v Speaker 1>That is a very popular theory among Ufo</v>
<v Speaker 1>fanatics.</v>

1763
01:18:07.430 --> 01:18:10.010
<v Speaker 1>Or she'll say fans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] I,</v>

1764
01:18:10.020 --> 01:18:12.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to speak again for my</v>
<v Speaker 1>company,</v>

1765
01:18:12.381 --> 01:18:15.830
<v Speaker 1>but one of the people on our board,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a scientific,</v>

1766
01:18:15.860 --> 01:18:17.990
<v Speaker 1>they call it a scientific advisory</v>
<v Speaker 1>board,</v>

1767
01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:23.120
<v Speaker 1>is a lead geneticists from Stanford who</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he was up for the Nobel this</v>

1768
01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:23.781
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what's his name?</v>

1769
01:18:23.781 --> 01:18:26.210
<v Speaker 1>Dr Gary Nolan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he will be the Jeanette.</v>

1770
01:18:26.230 --> 01:18:29.300
<v Speaker 1>He would be the guy to ask about that at</v>
<v Speaker 1>him in here.</v>

1771
01:18:29.330 --> 01:18:30.290
<v Speaker 1>But he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's,</v>

1772
01:18:30.380 --> 01:18:32.630
<v Speaker 1>he's only going to tell you what's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

1773
01:18:32.700 --> 01:18:35.140
<v Speaker 1>what he can prove with science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not going to speculate,</v>

1774
01:18:35.150 --> 01:18:36.140
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what,</v>

1775
01:18:36.380 --> 01:18:39.560
<v Speaker 1>what makes people think that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what's the science that makes</v>

1776
01:18:39.561 --> 01:18:40.450
<v Speaker 1>people think that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1777
01:18:40.460 --> 01:18:41.780
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of junk DNA.</v>

1778
01:18:41.780 --> 01:18:44.630
<v Speaker 1>There's certain parts of our DNA that</v>
<v Speaker 1>seems to have been turned off.</v>

1779
01:18:44.631 --> 01:18:46.260
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

1780
01:18:46.620 --> 01:18:51.530
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of things in there that we don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand and we don't have the leaps</v>

1781
01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:57.040
<v Speaker 1>of humanity over the past 5,000 years to</v>
<v Speaker 1>really show like where did,</v>

1782
01:18:57.380 --> 01:19:01.730
<v Speaker 1>what happened in the past 5,000 years</v>
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't happening for the hundreds</v>

1783
01:19:01.731 --> 01:19:05.570
<v Speaker 1>of millions of years before that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just found a footprint that was,</v>

1784
01:19:05.571 --> 01:19:07.760
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 100 million years old or something</v>

1785
01:19:07.761 --> 01:19:09.320
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was just a human footprint.</v>

1786
01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:11.570
<v Speaker 1>What they did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just read the news,</v>

1787
01:19:11.990 --> 01:19:13.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember,</v>

1788
01:19:13.131 --> 01:19:14.780
<v Speaker 1>but it's like a fossil and now they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1789
01:19:14.781 --> 01:19:17.240
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this totally throws everything upside</v>

1790
01:19:17.241 --> 01:19:18.440
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And talking to Sarah Pailin,</v>

1791
01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:20.030
<v Speaker 1>there was something to sell a pale and</v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

1792
01:19:20.060 --> 01:19:22.420
<v Speaker 1>remember that like there was a librarian</v>
<v Speaker 1>that said that she,</v>

1793
01:19:22.470 --> 01:19:23.960
<v Speaker 1>she didn't believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1794
01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:27.260
<v Speaker 1>she was a young Earth creationist and</v>
<v Speaker 1>she thought that,</v>

1795
01:19:27.261 --> 01:19:29.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a picture online that showed a</v>

1796
01:19:29.511 --> 01:19:32.750
<v Speaker 1>human footprint inside of dinosaur</v>
<v Speaker 1>footprint that approved the people</v>

1797
01:19:32.751 --> 01:19:33.680
<v Speaker 1>walked dinosaurs.</v>

1798
01:19:34.340 --> 01:19:36.910
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't doubt it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I doubt that people walked with diamond.</v>

1799
01:19:36.950 --> 01:19:37.551
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not at all.</v>

1800
01:19:37.551 --> 01:19:41.540
<v Speaker 1>I think there's been cycles of</v>
<v Speaker 1>civilizations and I think the people on</v>

1801
01:19:41.541 --> 01:19:44.360
<v Speaker 1>the inside know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why at that defense</v>

1802
01:19:44.361 --> 01:19:45.890
<v Speaker 1>contractor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>multi,</v>

1803
01:19:45.891 --> 01:19:46.491
<v Speaker 1>multi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>multi,</v>

1804
01:19:46.491 --> 01:19:49.520
<v Speaker 1>multibillion dollar defense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones that chose the government of</v>

1805
01:19:49.521 --> 01:19:53.330
<v Speaker 1>Iraq after we took over Iraq and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ones that looked over after all of our</v>

1806
01:19:53.331 --> 01:19:54.040
<v Speaker 1>nukes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1807
01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:56.090
<v Speaker 1>look it there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have print inside of dinosaur</v>

1808
01:19:56.091 --> 01:19:56.930
<v Speaker 1>footprints.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's right.</v>

1809
01:19:56.990 --> 01:19:58.170
<v Speaker 1>But they have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1810
01:19:58.760 --> 01:20:02.330
<v Speaker 1>but they have at that place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember I told you they have the past</v>

1811
01:20:02.331 --> 01:20:04.460
<v Speaker 1>and the future with big pyramids in</v>
<v Speaker 1>their hands,</v>

1812
01:20:04.490 --> 01:20:05.360
<v Speaker 1>which regions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1813
01:20:05.361 --> 01:20:06.350
<v Speaker 1>that they're trying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1814
01:20:07.210 --> 01:20:08.520
<v Speaker 1>it's a spooky</v>

1815
01:20:08.610 --> 01:20:12.000
<v Speaker 4>when you look at that and you believe</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the asteroid hit the Yucatan and</v>

1816
01:20:12.001 --> 01:20:15.030
<v Speaker 4>caused the mass extinction that killed</v>
<v Speaker 4>off most of the life on the planet.</v>

1817
01:20:15.180 --> 01:20:16.630
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't believe in it.</v>

1818
01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:17.341
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck,</v>

1819
01:20:17.341 --> 01:20:19.200
<v Speaker 4>I've never studied that shit and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>wasn't there.</v>

1820
01:20:19.380 --> 01:20:21.210
<v Speaker 4>But I mean there's physical evidence for</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1821
01:20:21.211 --> 01:20:22.170
<v Speaker 4>It's more like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1822
01:20:22.171 --> 01:20:23.640
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I haven't read anything about it.</v>

1823
01:20:23.641 --> 01:20:26.310
<v Speaker 4>But sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can believe in things.</v>

1824
01:20:26.311 --> 01:20:27.710
<v Speaker 4>I can't prove a lot of things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

1825
01:20:27.890 --> 01:20:29.460
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's like the whole reason why</v>

1826
01:20:29.461 --> 01:20:34.250
<v Speaker 4>we're supposedly here that it killed off</v>
<v Speaker 4>the dinosaurs and allowed whatever they</v>

1827
01:20:34.260 --> 01:20:38.700
<v Speaker 4>think there was some sort of a mole,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mole type creature that evolved over 65</v>

1828
01:20:38.700 --> 01:20:41.040
<v Speaker 4>million years ago was bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's all bullshit.</v>

1829
01:20:41.041 --> 01:20:43.050
<v Speaker 4>I think you think evolution bullshit?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1830
01:20:43.051 --> 01:20:45.750
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that at some point in history,</v>

1831
01:20:46.050 --> 01:20:47.010
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they came.</v>

1832
01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:50.820
<v Speaker 4>Someone came here and tampered with</v>
<v Speaker 4>existing creatures and made us an</v>

1833
01:20:50.821 --> 01:20:54.750
<v Speaker 4>upgraded us at very specific intervals</v>
<v Speaker 4>who tampered with them and what came</v>

1834
01:20:54.751 --> 01:20:55.740
<v Speaker 4>first,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the chicken or the egg.</v>

1835
01:20:55.800 --> 01:20:56.540
<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Question.</v>

1836
01:20:56.540 --> 01:20:57.373
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1837
01:20:57.420 --> 01:21:01.200
<v Speaker 4>A single celled organism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We all kind of agree like that was like</v>

1838
01:21:01.201 --> 01:21:02.160
<v Speaker 4>the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1839
01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:04.110
<v Speaker 4>Most scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not we,</v>

1840
01:21:04.140 --> 01:21:07.920
<v Speaker 4>I'm too stupid for this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but obviously somehow or another that</v>

1841
01:21:07.921 --> 01:21:09.180
<v Speaker 4>became a bird,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1842
01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:12.600
<v Speaker 4>Why couldn't it become a monkey?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why could that monkey become a person?</v>

1843
01:21:12.660 --> 01:21:13.291
<v Speaker 4>I think it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1844
01:21:13.291 --> 01:21:15.990
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean look at evolution changes.</v>

1845
01:21:15.991 --> 01:21:19.050
<v Speaker 4>I mean we can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we know that people that like beat their</v>

1846
01:21:19.051 --> 01:21:21.960
<v Speaker 4>kids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their kids DNA changes based on getting</v>

1847
01:21:21.961 --> 01:21:22.794
<v Speaker 4>beat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

1848
01:21:22.980 --> 01:21:25.860
<v Speaker 4>So when you were fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you were changing people's DNA and</v>

1849
01:21:25.861 --> 01:21:27.520
<v Speaker 4>you're a geneticist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1850
01:21:27.810 --> 01:21:30.390
<v Speaker 4>you went after it for science,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1851
01:21:30.540 --> 01:21:33.550
<v Speaker 4>that's why we were doing the fighting</v>
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>

1852
01:21:33.570 --> 01:21:35.370
<v Speaker 4>It's a lab coat on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you,</v>

1853
01:21:35.371 --> 01:21:39.810
<v Speaker 4>if you think about it that way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you think about that all life somehow</v>

1854
01:21:39.811 --> 01:21:43.610
<v Speaker 4>or another continues to evolve and</v>
<v Speaker 4>advanced and through natural selection,</v>

1855
01:21:43.620 --> 01:21:48.620
<v Speaker 4>genetic mutation and random mutations</v>
<v Speaker 4>that things move from one stage of</v>

1856
01:21:49.531 --> 01:21:51.930
<v Speaker 4>existence to what they are today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1857
01:21:51.931 --> 01:21:53.940
<v Speaker 4>That when you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1858
01:21:54.390 --> 01:21:58.500
<v Speaker 4>a con or a hippopotamus that it used to</v>
<v Speaker 4>be something different and now it's</v>

1859
01:21:58.501 --> 01:21:59.130
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure,</v>

1860
01:21:59.130 --> 01:22:00.870
<v Speaker 4>why wouldn't that be the case that</v>
<v Speaker 4>people too.</v>

1861
01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:05.250
<v Speaker 4>I think that is the case with people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just think that the quantum leaps in</v>

1862
01:22:05.251 --> 01:22:10.251
<v Speaker 4>our evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our symptoms or effects of being</v>

1863
01:22:10.770 --> 01:22:13.590
<v Speaker 4>genetically upgraded.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The way I've heard it explained to me</v>

1864
01:22:13.591 --> 01:22:14.424
<v Speaker 4>though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that those,</v>

1865
01:22:14.470 --> 01:22:18.030
<v Speaker 4>the only leap that's really confusing is</v>
<v Speaker 4>the doubling of the human brain.</v>

1866
01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:21.840
<v Speaker 4>You got a big leap and so over the</v>
<v Speaker 4>period of 2 million years apparently,</v>

1867
01:22:22.350 --> 01:22:24.150
<v Speaker 4>obviously I'm too stupid to really</v>
<v Speaker 4>understand this,</v>

1868
01:22:24.151 --> 01:22:26.340
<v Speaker 4>but from what I've read,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what I've heard people talk about,</v>

1869
01:22:26.580 --> 01:22:29.100
<v Speaker 4>that's apparently one of the biggest</v>
<v Speaker 4>misses mysteries,</v>

1870
01:22:29.470 --> 01:22:32.040
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when it comes to the human fossil</v>

1871
01:22:32.041 --> 01:22:35.010
<v Speaker 4>record.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But there's a pretty clear line</v>

1872
01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:37.340
<v Speaker 4>apparently from Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] to,</v>

1873
01:22:37.341 --> 01:22:39.660
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the homeless Judaism zig words on me.</v>

1874
01:22:39.710 --> 01:22:42.030
<v Speaker 4>Trying to pivot is not a big word like</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1875
01:22:42.450 --> 01:22:45.180
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck is that stuff again?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Penis,</v>

1876
01:22:45.260 --> 01:22:46.890
<v Speaker 4>anus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

1877
01:22:47.060 --> 01:22:48.030
<v Speaker 4>That's called.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One 15,</v>

1878
01:22:48.300 --> 01:22:50.730
<v Speaker 4>1:15.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's death on that stuff.</v>

1879
01:22:51.290 --> 01:22:55.560
<v Speaker 4>So what is your company aiming to do and</v>
<v Speaker 4>when are you trying to do it?</v>

1880
01:22:55.680 --> 01:22:58.320
<v Speaker 4>So the next steps.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So to the Stars Academy of Arts and</v>

1881
01:22:58.321 --> 01:23:01.110
<v Speaker 4>Science wise we have an academy because</v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

1882
01:23:01.170 --> 01:23:01.850
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

1883
01:23:01.850 --> 01:23:03.450
<v Speaker 4>there's teaching,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's science,</v>

1884
01:23:03.480 --> 01:23:05.980
<v Speaker 4>there's art major know there's film</v>

1885
01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:07.950
<v Speaker 2>franchises.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what this doesn't say musicals,</v>

1886
01:23:07.990 --> 01:23:08.823
<v Speaker 2>know musicals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1887
01:23:08.830 --> 01:23:12.820
<v Speaker 2>It's only musicals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Musicals.</v>

1888
01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:16.060
<v Speaker 2>It's like everything is cool but not</v>
<v Speaker 2>really stupid art forum.</v>

1889
01:23:16.660 --> 01:23:18.220
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a musical,</v>

1890
01:23:18.221 --> 01:23:20.350
<v Speaker 2>but it's very salacious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very,</v>

1891
01:23:20.351 --> 01:23:22.560
<v Speaker 2>very sexual musicals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But okay.</v>

1892
01:23:22.570 --> 01:23:26.620
<v Speaker 2>So what we did essentially is you have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>senior engineer,</v>

1893
01:23:27.850 --> 01:23:31.630
<v Speaker 2>chief engineer from the classified</v>
<v Speaker 2>aerospace world building shit.</v>

1894
01:23:31.780 --> 01:23:35.740
<v Speaker 2>And then you have a guy like me that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>putting out some stories and making some</v>

1895
01:23:35.741 --> 01:23:39.430
<v Speaker 2>movies about some things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you have my physicists.</v>

1896
01:23:39.460 --> 01:23:40.900
<v Speaker 2>Can I stop you there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry to interrupt,</v>

1897
01:23:40.901 --> 01:23:44.950
<v Speaker 2>but why stories and why fiction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like why not just going to be both.</v>

1898
01:23:44.970 --> 01:23:46.450
<v Speaker 2>There's maybe both,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but why fiction?</v>

1899
01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:51.480
<v Speaker 2>Why not just concentrate entirely on</v>
<v Speaker 2>revealing the truth because it has to be</v>

1900
01:23:51.491 --> 01:23:55.300
<v Speaker 2>managed in a certain way for people to</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand and I think that someone's</v>

1901
01:23:55.301 --> 01:23:59.560
<v Speaker 2>sitting down and watching a debate play</v>
<v Speaker 2>out and having an idea of what,</v>

1902
01:24:00.070 --> 01:24:02.110
<v Speaker 2>what went on over the past 70 years.</v>

1903
01:24:02.410 --> 01:24:05.410
<v Speaker 2>They'll come out of that with an</v>
<v Speaker 2>emotional response and more of an</v>

1904
01:24:05.411 --> 01:24:08.590
<v Speaker 2>understanding and then want to go watch</v>
<v Speaker 2>the documentary and then want to buy</v>

1905
01:24:08.950 --> 01:24:10.600
<v Speaker 2>some of the nonfiction works that we've</v>
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>

1906
01:24:10.601 --> 01:24:11.650
<v Speaker 2>I've already put out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1907
01:24:11.820 --> 01:24:13.570
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of our nonfiction books with secret</v>

1908
01:24:13.571 --> 01:24:15.370
<v Speaker 2>machines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the,</v>

1909
01:24:15.410 --> 01:24:16.330
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that movie.</v>

1910
01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:17.440
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Arrival.</v>

1911
01:24:17.550 --> 01:24:19.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was at the movie where there's like</v>

1912
01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:24.600
<v Speaker 2>sort of weird time shit in that movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does that movie have any basis in</v>

1913
01:24:25.151 --> 01:24:26.820
<v Speaker 2>reality?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1914
01:24:26.890 --> 01:24:28.750
<v Speaker 2>Secret people behind the scenes?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1915
01:24:28.751 --> 01:24:29.590
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1916
01:24:29.591 --> 01:24:31.240
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing in there that's familiar</v>

1917
01:24:31.241 --> 01:24:36.160
<v Speaker 2>to me other than the fact that the dream</v>
<v Speaker 2>sequences and the time stuff and her</v>

1918
01:24:36.340 --> 01:24:39.670
<v Speaker 2>having flashes of that shit's absolutely</v>
<v Speaker 2>on par.</v>

1919
01:24:40.030 --> 01:24:40.863
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1920
01:24:40.870 --> 01:24:44.720
<v Speaker 2>the idea of having a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an international group work together and</v>

1921
01:24:44.730 --> 01:24:47.980
<v Speaker 2>figure something out that's absolutely</v>
<v Speaker 2>on what's happening right now.</v>

1922
01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:49.630
<v Speaker 2>And everybody's keeping their mouth</v>
<v Speaker 2>shut.</v>

1923
01:24:49.780 --> 01:24:51.550
<v Speaker 2>Oh fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are they doing that?</v>

1924
01:24:51.810 --> 01:24:53.500
<v Speaker 2>Why aren't people spilling the beans?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1925
01:24:53.680 --> 01:24:54.513
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not every.</v>

1926
01:24:54.550 --> 01:24:56.080
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at Lou Elizondo,</v>

1927
01:24:56.081 --> 01:24:58.150
<v Speaker 2>the guy that works for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just came from the Pentagon,</v>

1928
01:24:58.151 --> 01:25:00.070
<v Speaker 2>literally quit the Pentagon two weeks</v>
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>

1929
01:25:00.220 --> 01:25:03.040
<v Speaker 2>I was the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't tell you where I'm at,</v>

1930
01:25:03.100 --> 01:25:05.080
<v Speaker 2>but I know I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1931
01:25:05.081 --> 01:25:05.871
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1932
01:25:05.871 --> 01:25:07.350
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's with me and he,</v>

1933
01:25:07.450 --> 01:25:12.160
<v Speaker 2>he was onstage with me on the live event</v>
<v Speaker 2>we did on the 11 saying I left the</v>

1934
01:25:12.161 --> 01:25:17.161
<v Speaker 2>Pentagon days ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ran this particular Ufo program and</v>

1935
01:25:17.351 --> 01:25:20.770
<v Speaker 2>this is what we know and they are real</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're gonna continue that program</v>

1936
01:25:20.771 --> 01:25:23.880
<v Speaker 2>here at to the stars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now what's your.</v>

1937
01:25:23.890 --> 01:25:27.250
<v Speaker 2>So your goal is to release this</v>
<v Speaker 2>information through documentaries,</v>

1938
01:25:27.251 --> 01:25:29.290
<v Speaker 2>through films,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and educate people,</v>

1939
01:25:29.370 --> 01:25:32.290
<v Speaker 2>but the existence of this and is it to</v>
<v Speaker 2>make a ship?</v>

1940
01:25:32.770 --> 01:25:33.191
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1941
01:25:33.191 --> 01:25:35.350
<v Speaker 2>So we're bringing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is once again,</v>

1942
01:25:35.351 --> 01:25:37.300
<v Speaker 2>look there by putting together.</v>

1943
01:25:37.300 --> 01:25:42.130
<v Speaker 2>You can't attack this subject by just</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you make a movie that's a crazy</v>

1944
01:25:42.131 --> 01:25:44.230
<v Speaker 2>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you make a science paper on it and</v>

1945
01:25:44.231 --> 01:25:48.040
<v Speaker 2>then no one's going to read it and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>technology will never see the light of</v>

1946
01:25:48.041 --> 01:25:53.041
<v Speaker 2>day because it's been modified as</v>
<v Speaker 2>weaponry or whatever it is that the only</v>

1947
01:25:53.351 --> 01:25:58.351
<v Speaker 2>way to get people to understand what the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck is going on is by first present</v>

1948
01:25:59.471 --> 01:26:03.010
<v Speaker 2>them the story so they have an</v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding that it is real and it</v>

1949
01:26:03.170 --> 01:26:08.120
<v Speaker 2>happening and laid in a way that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>grounded and practical and uh,</v>

1950
01:26:08.150 --> 01:26:12.590
<v Speaker 2>but still moves you and then follow up</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the science and then show them that</v>

1951
01:26:12.591 --> 01:26:16.850
<v Speaker 2>that thing you're watching in the movie</v>
<v Speaker 2>can be engineered and created.</v>

1952
01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.820
<v Speaker 2>So we're doing it all together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's a thing called a community</v>

1953
01:26:19.821 --> 01:26:23.480
<v Speaker 2>of interest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to the stars is also building a</v>

1954
01:26:23.481 --> 01:26:27.920
<v Speaker 2>portal with the Department of Defense to</v>
<v Speaker 2>share information,</v>

1955
01:26:28.010 --> 01:26:31.400
<v Speaker 2>to educate people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to put some declassified now</v>

1956
01:26:31.401 --> 01:26:34.280
<v Speaker 2>declassified videos of Ufo shows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some science,</v>

1957
01:26:34.281 --> 01:26:36.050
<v Speaker 2>some documents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and have open forums,</v>

1958
01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:38.930
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and have current military people talk to</v>

1959
01:26:38.931 --> 01:26:39.764
<v Speaker 2>young adults.</v>

1960
01:26:39.830 --> 01:26:43.900
<v Speaker 2>So you're gonna expose people to this</v>
<v Speaker 2>narrative and uh,</v>

1961
01:26:43.940 --> 01:26:48.940
<v Speaker 2>explained to them through stories what</v>
<v Speaker 2>this could be that sets the stage.</v>

1962
01:26:49.370 --> 01:26:53.860
<v Speaker 2>Then you start to introduce the actual</v>
<v Speaker 2>real elements that actually exist yet.</v>

1963
01:26:54.350 --> 01:26:58.280
<v Speaker 2>And then eventually what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the end game will the end game is</v>

1964
01:26:58.281 --> 01:27:00.650
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The technology itself is like.</v>

1965
01:27:00.980 --> 01:27:03.680
<v Speaker 2>So when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you make a,</v>

1966
01:27:03.740 --> 01:27:05.640
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you create this energy source to</v>

1967
01:27:05.641 --> 01:27:08.180
<v Speaker 2>power the spacecraft,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's called an over unity machine.</v>

1968
01:27:08.181 --> 01:27:11.270
<v Speaker 2>So it puts out more power than what's</v>
<v Speaker 2>put into it.</v>

1969
01:27:11.510 --> 01:27:16.510
<v Speaker 2>You can desalinate ocean water with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can get rid of a atomic power.</v>

1970
01:27:16.590 --> 01:27:18.710
<v Speaker 2>So there's no radio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no more Fukushima xeno.</v>

1971
01:27:18.980 --> 01:27:22.310
<v Speaker 2>It could do a lot of different things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it also will rapidly,</v>

1972
01:27:22.460 --> 01:27:26.600
<v Speaker 2>rapidly transform our entire</v>
<v Speaker 2>transportation and communication</v>

1973
01:27:26.601 --> 01:27:30.220
<v Speaker 2>network.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the end result with that is it,</v>

1974
01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:35.240
<v Speaker 2>that'll get spun out into a accompany.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's probably partners with major</v>

1975
01:27:36.351 --> 01:27:40.790
<v Speaker 2>aerospace organizations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which with whom I'm already talking and</v>

1976
01:27:40.791 --> 01:27:41.890
<v Speaker 2>we partner on the madness.</v>

1977
01:27:41.930 --> 01:27:43.130
<v Speaker 2>You can't tell me who they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1978
01:27:43.131 --> 01:27:46.520
<v Speaker 2>fuck now I can't tell you and we bring</v>
<v Speaker 2>that out to the world,</v>

1979
01:27:46.521 --> 01:27:50.630
<v Speaker 2>but the only way that can be brought out</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the world as if the public owns it</v>

1980
01:27:50.870 --> 01:27:53.810
<v Speaker 2>and we build it from scratch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The public was the public have to own it</v>

1981
01:27:53.840 --> 01:27:55.820
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I guess you could be in a way a</v>

1982
01:27:55.821 --> 01:27:57.980
<v Speaker 2>private person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the technology,</v>

1983
01:27:58.430 --> 01:28:01.490
<v Speaker 2>it probably has an element of what they</v>
<v Speaker 2>call eminent domain.</v>

1984
01:28:01.580 --> 01:28:05.300
<v Speaker 2>So we're going to get to a certain point</v>
<v Speaker 2>where certain agencies will probably</v>

1985
01:28:05.301 --> 01:28:07.370
<v Speaker 2>knock on our door and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck are you doing?</v>

1986
01:28:07.371 --> 01:28:10.070
<v Speaker 2>And we're going to say the public owns</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

1987
01:28:10.071 --> 01:28:11.630
<v Speaker 2>You can't take it from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're gonna say fuck yeah,</v>

1988
01:28:11.631 --> 01:28:13.400
<v Speaker 2>we can take it and we're going to say</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to work something out</v>

1989
01:28:13.790 --> 01:28:16.280
<v Speaker 2>because it's like building a nuclear</v>
<v Speaker 2>bomb in your basement kind of thing.</v>

1990
01:28:16.280 --> 01:28:19.040
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so when you say the public owns it,</v>

1991
01:28:19.070 --> 01:28:20.810
<v Speaker 2>like how will that be possible?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How would the,</v>

1992
01:28:20.870 --> 01:28:23.810
<v Speaker 2>how will the public own it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The you can go to our,</v>

1993
01:28:23.811 --> 01:28:26.840
<v Speaker 2>we've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we reserved a small amount of shares of</v>

1994
01:28:26.841 --> 01:28:29.330
<v Speaker 2>the company that people can buy stock in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the company right now.</v>

1995
01:28:29.570 --> 01:28:31.480
<v Speaker 2>So a year ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the success,</v>

1996
01:28:31.500 --> 01:28:33.110
<v Speaker 2>not the public.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's private,</v>

1997
01:28:33.180 --> 01:28:34.640
<v Speaker 2>that's private ownership,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1998
01:28:34.641 --> 01:28:37.650
<v Speaker 2>If people buy the company can go public,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no it didn't.</v>

1999
01:28:37.670 --> 01:28:38.420
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is public.</v>

2000
01:28:38.420 --> 01:28:41.300
<v Speaker 2>So a year and a half ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe 24 months ago,</v>

2001
01:28:41.690 --> 01:28:44.900
<v Speaker 2>the sec wanted to democratize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2002
01:28:45.150 --> 01:28:47.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going public with companies just like an</v>

2003
01:28:47.691 --> 01:28:50.060
<v Speaker 2>IPO but not have to spend millions of</v>
<v Speaker 2>dollars and do it.</v>

2004
01:28:50.061 --> 01:28:51.770
<v Speaker 2>So they launched what's called a</v>
<v Speaker 2>regulation,</v>

2005
01:28:51.771 --> 01:28:55.820
<v Speaker 2>a direct public offering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we had a file with the SEC.</v>

2006
01:28:55.821 --> 01:28:59.180
<v Speaker 2>So we had to spend hundreds of thousands</v>
<v Speaker 2>of dollars to do this and we spent the</v>

2007
01:28:59.181 --> 01:29:01.980
<v Speaker 2>last six months doing it and our live</v>
<v Speaker 2>event</v>

2008
01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:03.660
<v Speaker 1>launch that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can go to tennis.</v>

2009
01:29:03.740 --> 01:29:08.740
<v Speaker 1>Did this just so that you can tell the</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoever the fuck it is that will come</v>

2010
01:29:08.941 --> 01:29:09.990
<v Speaker 1>after you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that hey,</v>

2011
01:29:09.991 --> 01:29:11.760
<v Speaker 1>the public owns this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't take that.</v>

2012
01:29:11.790 --> 01:29:14.610
<v Speaker 1>That's one element of everything that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're doing.</v>

2013
01:29:14.640 --> 01:29:15.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That.</v>

2014
01:29:16.080 --> 01:29:19.080
<v Speaker 1>So you're anticipate you're spending</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of thousands of dollars to</v>

2015
01:29:19.081 --> 01:29:23.040
<v Speaker 1>anticipate someone coming in and closing</v>
<v Speaker 1>the doors and they yet you're talking</v>

2016
01:29:23.041 --> 01:29:25.250
<v Speaker 1>about it in advance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're like,</v>

2017
01:29:25.251 --> 01:29:28.200
<v Speaker 1>you're essentially telling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strategizing that you know,</v>

2018
01:29:28.201 --> 01:29:29.730
<v Speaker 1>but you're letting them know that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

2019
01:29:29.731 --> 01:29:32.190
<v Speaker 1>that they're going to come and get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be much harder to shut it down when</v>

2020
01:29:32.191 --> 01:29:34.470
<v Speaker 1>the whole world has paid for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>invested in it,</v>

2021
01:29:34.471 --> 01:29:35.930
<v Speaker 1>owns it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

2022
01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.220
<v Speaker 1>so he trying to get people to buy</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

2023
01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:40.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean you tried to get people</v>

2024
01:29:40.051 --> 01:29:41.790
<v Speaker 1>to buy stock?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2025
01:29:41.791 --> 01:29:42.960
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right now we're a public.</v>

2026
01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:44.610
<v Speaker 1>You can buy shares of the company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can only.</v>

2027
01:29:44.611 --> 01:29:47.730
<v Speaker 1>We only put up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a very limited amount that we only</v>

2028
01:29:47.731 --> 01:29:50.010
<v Speaker 1>put it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we only put up $5 million shares</v>

2029
01:29:50.011 --> 01:29:51.840
<v Speaker 1>or so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems like a lot of shares.</v>

2030
01:29:51.841 --> 01:29:55.330
<v Speaker 1>How many shares are they're all others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Lord is like a 100 million probably</v>

2031
01:29:55.380 --> 01:29:56.520
<v Speaker 1>or something like 100.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does that,</v>

2032
01:29:56.600 --> 01:29:58.190
<v Speaker 1>how does shares work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shares late.</v>

2033
01:29:58.230 --> 01:29:59.670
<v Speaker 1>You just don't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like say if we,</v>

2034
01:29:59.671 --> 01:30:02.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>came up with young Jamie incorporated.</v>

2035
01:30:02.050 --> 01:30:03.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we wanted to start selling shares.</v>

2036
01:30:03.961 --> 01:30:08.040
<v Speaker 1>When you file as a corporation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can issue shares and you can sell</v>

2037
01:30:08.041 --> 01:30:12.240
<v Speaker 1>those shares to people in those shares.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have a price based on,</v>

2038
01:30:12.241 --> 01:30:13.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you want to value your company,</v>

2039
01:30:13.891 --> 01:30:14.700
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2040
01:30:14.700 --> 01:30:17.700
<v Speaker 1>So you could have like 100 million</v>
<v Speaker 1>shares of young Jamie Incorporated.</v>

2041
01:30:17.790 --> 01:30:18.900
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You sure can.</v>

2042
01:30:18.930 --> 01:30:21.210
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then the government can shut you</v>

2043
01:30:21.211 --> 01:30:21.810
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>

2044
01:30:21.810 --> 01:30:24.480
<v Speaker 1>Nah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you guys may be because you say a</v>

2045
01:30:24.481 --> 01:30:25.460
<v Speaker 1>lot of bad words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2046
01:30:25.461 --> 01:30:25.831
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2047
01:30:25.831 --> 01:30:27.660
<v Speaker 1>Jamie doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm warming.</v>

2048
01:30:27.780 --> 01:30:29.430
<v Speaker 1>We do a lot at the company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2049
01:30:29.431 --> 01:30:33.210
<v Speaker 1>So we're building essentially a science</v>
<v Speaker 1>fiction version of Disney.</v>

2050
01:30:33.300 --> 01:30:35.220
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we have four film franchises.</v>

2051
01:30:35.221 --> 01:30:36.540
<v Speaker 1>Not all of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about Ufos.</v>

2052
01:30:37.020 --> 01:30:41.700
<v Speaker 1>One is kind of this blade runner night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all about nightmares kind of thing.</v>

2053
01:30:41.701 --> 01:30:44.940
<v Speaker 1>One is like an old amblin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spielberg goes and making these things</v>

2054
01:30:45.060 --> 01:30:45.850
<v Speaker 1>a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are.</v>

2055
01:30:45.850 --> 01:30:48.210
<v Speaker 1>Let me know who's writing them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote the first one.</v>

2056
01:30:48.211 --> 01:30:52.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm directing that a good directing too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote this script and you're multi</v>

2057
01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:54.840
<v Speaker 1>talented motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look I'm,</v>

2058
01:30:54.900 --> 01:30:56.910
<v Speaker 1>that's where I'm going with most of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

2059
01:30:56.911 --> 01:31:00.000
<v Speaker 1>But the company I had to get up and get</v>
<v Speaker 1>going and set it up and we bring in a</v>

2060
01:31:00.001 --> 01:31:02.850
<v Speaker 1>ceo and all that kind of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a bizarre formula,</v>

2061
01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:03.240
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2062
01:31:03.240 --> 01:31:07.290
<v Speaker 1>An entertainment company that's also</v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna do aerospace and science will.</v>

2063
01:31:07.350 --> 01:31:11.340
<v Speaker 1>The heart of it is when we do what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>called confirmation,</v>

2064
01:31:11.430 --> 01:31:15.480
<v Speaker 1>not disclosure confirmation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A the heart of it is is how do we tell</v>

2065
01:31:15.481 --> 01:31:19.240
<v Speaker 1>stories that galvanized the human race</v>
<v Speaker 1>and let them know a little bit more</v>

2066
01:31:19.241 --> 01:31:23.040
<v Speaker 1>about what's going on and how do we</v>
<v Speaker 1>present them science so they understand</v>

2067
01:31:23.041 --> 01:31:25.920
<v Speaker 1>the consciousness and a lot of other</v>
<v Speaker 1>things are real.</v>

2068
01:31:26.160 --> 01:31:30.390
<v Speaker 1>And how do we build a technology</v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with those stories and with</v>

2069
01:31:30.391 --> 01:31:33.450
<v Speaker 1>dos science that can change the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why it's an academy.</v>

2070
01:31:33.480 --> 01:31:35.550
<v Speaker 1>So they have any pickled bodies</v>
<v Speaker 1>anywhere.</v>

2071
01:31:36.340 --> 01:31:39.450
<v Speaker 1>I go from Ohio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe they do believe they do.</v>

2072
01:31:39.480 --> 01:31:41.740
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's ever told you that I believe to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get.</v>

2073
01:31:41.790 --> 01:31:43.800
<v Speaker 1>I believe they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You believe they do?</v>

2074
01:31:43.801 --> 01:31:46.760
<v Speaker 1>You can't say anymore than.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not gonna say anymore than that said</v>

2075
01:31:46.770 --> 01:31:49.860
<v Speaker 1>so much what you can and can't say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2076
01:31:49.861 --> 01:31:52.920
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you other shit offline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably offline.</v>

2077
01:31:52.950 --> 01:31:56.140
<v Speaker 1>I can't wait to end this podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking kick me out.</v>

2078
01:31:56.240 --> 01:31:57.690
<v Speaker 1>I tell anybody please.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some weird shit.</v>

2079
01:31:57.790 --> 01:31:59.850
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now what,</v>

2080
01:31:59.880 --> 01:32:00.130
<v Speaker 1>what's</v>

2081
01:32:00.130 --> 01:32:02.320
<v Speaker 2>the timeline for moving forward with all</v>
<v Speaker 2>this stuff?</v>

2082
01:32:02.350 --> 01:32:05.080
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in the next few weeks we're going to</v>

2083
01:32:05.081 --> 01:32:09.160
<v Speaker 2>be releasing the first declassified</v>
<v Speaker 2>videos of these advanced aerial threat</v>

2084
01:32:09.240 --> 01:32:10.500
<v Speaker 2>Ufos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2085
01:32:10.690 --> 01:32:14.230
<v Speaker 2>and they are current videos that were</v>
<v Speaker 2>just caught and with audio and</v>

2086
01:32:14.231 --> 01:32:16.230
<v Speaker 2>everything of the people tracking and</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2087
01:32:16.240 --> 01:32:18.550
<v Speaker 2>and we're going to launch the Beta</v>
<v Speaker 2>version of the community of interest,</v>

2088
01:32:18.551 --> 01:32:20.830
<v Speaker 2>which is the partnered website that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be hosting all this</v>

2089
01:32:20.831 --> 01:32:23.970
<v Speaker 2>declassified information where we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>gonna be having the hardcore.</v>

2090
01:32:24.480 --> 01:32:28.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm a conversations with people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to understand this stuff.</v>

2091
01:32:29.320 --> 01:32:33.340
<v Speaker 2>We're going to be also doing an</v>
<v Speaker 2>experiment with that piece of metal to</v>

2092
01:32:33.341 --> 01:32:36.880
<v Speaker 2>show the world that the technology is</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only real,</v>

2093
01:32:36.881 --> 01:32:40.680
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's demonstrated and the videos are</v>

2094
01:32:40.690 --> 01:32:42.380
<v Speaker 2>very much a proof of concept,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2095
01:32:42.381 --> 01:32:43.910
<v Speaker 2>it was showing you look at works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2096
01:32:43.930 --> 01:32:45.970
<v Speaker 2>so we're going to build it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

2097
01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.850
<v Speaker 2>do you think it's gonna be weird for</v>
<v Speaker 2>people to take you seriously because</v>

2098
01:32:48.851 --> 01:32:49.900
<v Speaker 2>you're a rockstar like me.</v>

2099
01:32:49.900 --> 01:32:53.470
<v Speaker 2>If you were like some sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>physicist scientist that would listen to</v>

2100
01:32:53.471 --> 01:32:54.340
<v Speaker 2>you more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2101
01:32:54.341 --> 01:32:57.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember when Ellen came out years ago</v>

2102
01:32:57.011 --> 01:33:00.410
<v Speaker 2>and he started space x and then he</v>
<v Speaker 2>started test that.</v>

2103
01:33:00.430 --> 01:33:01.900
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's this dude saying all this</v>

2104
01:33:01.901 --> 01:33:03.940
<v Speaker 2>ambitious shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't buy any of it.</v>

2105
01:33:03.941 --> 01:33:06.510
<v Speaker 2>I think guys a 100 times smarter than</v>
<v Speaker 2>the both of us combined.</v>

2106
01:33:06.511 --> 01:33:08.020
<v Speaker 2>The he's fucking gnarly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

2107
01:33:08.050 --> 01:33:11.080
<v Speaker 2>but I'm just saying he caught believable</v>
<v Speaker 2>once a year maybe.</v>

2108
01:33:11.081 --> 01:33:12.250
<v Speaker 2>And maybe I think he is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2109
01:33:12.251 --> 01:33:13.150
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's bad ass.</v>

2110
01:33:13.151 --> 01:33:16.240
<v Speaker 2>But look at the people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what's interesting to me is you</v>

2111
01:33:16.241 --> 01:33:20.440
<v Speaker 2>haven't seen who are with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you looked at the bios on the shit?</v>

2112
01:33:20.590 --> 01:33:21.140
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2113
01:33:21.140 --> 01:33:24.250
<v Speaker 2>you got to read the Bios of the people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to be tainted.</v>

2114
01:33:24.251 --> 01:33:27.100
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to talk to one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on my,</v>

2115
01:33:27.700 --> 01:33:31.000
<v Speaker 2>on my sat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Scientific Board Advisory Board is,</v>

2116
01:33:31.060 --> 01:33:33.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the guys that CIA that headed up</v>

2117
01:33:33.011 --> 01:33:35.920
<v Speaker 2>the entire biowarfare program and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>director of operations,</v>

2118
01:33:35.921 --> 01:33:36.870
<v Speaker 2>the client desk nine divisions.</v>

2119
01:33:36.900 --> 01:33:40.480
<v Speaker 2>All these guys have found us how various</v>
<v Speaker 2>ways.</v>

2120
01:33:40.720 --> 01:33:43.690
<v Speaker 2>So they've come to you because they like</v>
<v Speaker 2>the beacon.</v>

2121
01:33:44.080 --> 01:33:46.690
<v Speaker 2>I did something as this is the way to</v>
<v Speaker 2>go.</v>

2122
01:33:46.750 --> 01:33:49.500
<v Speaker 2>I did something that no one thought was</v>
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>

2123
01:33:49.530 --> 01:33:53.980
<v Speaker 2>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was tying together a mechanism that can</v>

2124
01:33:53.981 --> 01:33:58.981
<v Speaker 2>perpetually fund itself and can</v>
<v Speaker 2>communicate and can innovate all with</v>

2125
01:34:01.841 --> 01:34:05.590
<v Speaker 2>people that sit at the seat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I created a round table with engineers,</v>

2126
01:34:05.591 --> 01:34:09.580
<v Speaker 2>scientists until high ranking</v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence officials and uh,</v>

2127
01:34:10.030 --> 01:34:11.730
<v Speaker 2>and some others I can't tell you about</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2128
01:34:11.731 --> 01:34:15.670
<v Speaker 2>obviously in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the defense world,</v>

2129
01:34:15.700 --> 01:34:17.620
<v Speaker 2>it's called stove piping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when they,</v>

2130
01:34:18.010 --> 01:34:21.610
<v Speaker 2>when they compartmentalize a secret,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they put them into these vertical</v>

2131
01:34:21.611 --> 01:34:23.800
<v Speaker 2>categories that can't talk to each</v>
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>

2132
01:34:24.010 --> 01:34:28.990
<v Speaker 2>I created a horizontal structure where</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these people in these amazing</v>

2133
01:34:28.991 --> 01:34:33.130
<v Speaker 2>accomplished positions in government</v>
<v Speaker 2>were able to come together at the same</v>

2134
01:34:33.131 --> 01:34:38.131
<v Speaker 2>table and they can discuss what we want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to teach the world and how we want to do</v>

2135
01:34:39.011 --> 01:34:39.610
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2136
01:34:39.610 --> 01:34:42.430
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the but the way to do that is</v>

2137
01:34:42.520 --> 01:34:45.790
<v Speaker 2>including the public and making it a</v>
<v Speaker 2>public benefit corporation.</v>

2138
01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:50.080
<v Speaker 2>And what that means is we're able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>spend money and it's in our charter on</v>

2139
01:34:50.081 --> 01:34:53.230
<v Speaker 2>things that can benefit the world and</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just provide a return to the</v>

2140
01:34:53.231 --> 01:34:55.720
<v Speaker 2>investors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what we're doing happens to be</v>

2141
01:34:55.721 --> 01:34:57.130
<v Speaker 2>extremely lucrative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lucrative,</v>

2142
01:34:57.430 --> 01:34:58.620
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my engine,</v>

2143
01:34:58.760 --> 01:35:01.670
<v Speaker 2>lucrative for investors or insure</v>
<v Speaker 2>investors and the company.</v>

2144
01:35:01.671 --> 01:35:04.160
<v Speaker 2>So it was it like saved young.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie wants to be a part of it.</v>

2145
01:35:04.540 --> 01:35:05.660
<v Speaker 2>What does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does he have to do?</v>

2146
01:35:05.690 --> 01:35:08.930
<v Speaker 2>You just go to the Stars Academy Dot Com</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you buy shares whatever you want to</v>

2147
01:35:08.931 --> 01:35:11.720
<v Speaker 2>buy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I will be lucrative for him because</v>

2148
01:35:11.721 --> 01:35:15.710
<v Speaker 2>the first of all the technology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it sounds like a trillion dollar thing.</v>

2149
01:35:15.740 --> 01:35:18.920
<v Speaker 2>If we can figure that out over the next</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight years and they think we can.</v>

2150
01:35:18.921 --> 01:35:19.640
<v Speaker 2>So they.</v>

2151
01:35:19.640 --> 01:35:20.680
<v Speaker 2>Who's they?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

2152
01:35:20.720 --> 01:35:22.310
<v Speaker 2>the engineers that are building this</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

2153
01:35:22.311 --> 01:35:24.590
<v Speaker 2>The guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Steve Justice that was head of</v>

2154
01:35:24.591 --> 01:35:26.960
<v Speaker 2>advanced programs at the skunk works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We talked about that.</v>

2155
01:35:27.020 --> 01:35:31.190
<v Speaker 2>They build all of our.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are the tip of the spear for the</v>

2156
01:35:31.191 --> 01:35:35.180
<v Speaker 2>most advanced spacecraft and aircraft</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the United States national security</v>

2157
01:35:35.181 --> 01:35:37.100
<v Speaker 2>apparatus has period,</v>
<v Speaker 2>period.</v>

2158
01:35:37.310 --> 01:35:41.150
<v Speaker 2>Hands down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was the big boy there and their</v>

2159
01:35:41.151 --> 01:35:44.870
<v Speaker 2>model,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we think we have a s,</v>

2160
01:35:44.930 --> 01:35:46.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a,</v>

2161
01:35:46.520 --> 01:35:49.190
<v Speaker 2>this is a guest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think there's a 60 percent chance</v>

2162
01:35:49.191 --> 01:35:52.820
<v Speaker 2>within 36 months or so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll be able to demonstrate something</v>

2163
01:35:52.910 --> 01:35:56.780
<v Speaker 2>pretty kick ass and as long as there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>no major obstacle there,</v>

2164
01:35:57.020 --> 01:35:59.930
<v Speaker 2>we think within eight years we'll be</v>
<v Speaker 2>able to have something but it's</v>

2165
01:35:59.931 --> 01:36:02.240
<v Speaker 2>expensive and we've got to work with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>government and we're going to have to</v>

2166
01:36:02.241 --> 01:36:04.190
<v Speaker 2>work with major aerospace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

2167
01:36:04.520 --> 01:36:08.600
<v Speaker 2>this one meeting I have coming up with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a big name aerospace company,</v>

2168
01:36:09.170 --> 01:36:11.090
<v Speaker 2>is offering their material sciences</v>
<v Speaker 2>division.</v>

2169
01:36:11.120 --> 01:36:13.640
<v Speaker 2>We need that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need to be able to create certain</v>

2170
01:36:13.641 --> 01:36:16.550
<v Speaker 2>metals that can resonate and circle</v>
<v Speaker 2>certain frequencies,</v>

2171
01:36:16.551 --> 01:36:18.920
<v Speaker 2>shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other way that the company makes</v>

2172
01:36:18.921 --> 01:36:23.300
<v Speaker 2>money is when we build this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the satellite launching system.</v>

2173
01:36:23.540 --> 01:36:26.960
<v Speaker 2>That's like exactly what [inaudible]</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing now putting satellites in orbit,</v>

2174
01:36:26.961 --> 01:36:29.810
<v Speaker 2>but we don't have to build rockets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can launch them with lasers.</v>

2175
01:36:30.050 --> 01:36:33.620
<v Speaker 2>That's a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You point lasers at the bottom of a cube</v>

2176
01:36:33.621 --> 01:36:35.240
<v Speaker 2>sat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is like the size of a shoe box,</v>

2177
01:36:35.540 --> 01:36:38.600
<v Speaker 2>and you can put it into low earth orbit</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can put it up even higher</v>

2178
01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:40.940
<v Speaker 2>without using any fossil fuels with</v>
<v Speaker 2>using light.</v>

2179
01:36:41.090 --> 01:36:44.060
<v Speaker 2>That's a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a multibillion dollar gimmick</v>

2180
01:36:44.061 --> 01:36:45.680
<v Speaker 2>right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just been proven.</v>

2181
01:36:46.140 --> 01:36:47.310
<v Speaker 2>I told you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing the proof.</v>

2182
01:36:47.920 --> 01:36:51.380
<v Speaker 2>There's this video of this accident.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's in our launch video.</v>

2183
01:36:51.381 --> 01:36:54.530
<v Speaker 2>If you watch the video at the top of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the Stars Academy Dot Com page,</v>

2184
01:36:54.710 --> 01:36:55.880
<v Speaker 2>you'll see shots of it.</v>

2185
01:36:55.990 --> 01:36:58.430
<v Speaker 2>We're a little thing's glowing and is</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting beamed up into the sky.</v>

2186
01:36:58.431 --> 01:36:59.710
<v Speaker 2>That's the air force.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2187
01:36:59.870 --> 01:37:02.490
<v Speaker 2>My guys were on that project.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Little thing's glowing or.</v>

2188
01:37:02.680 --> 01:37:04.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a mass though.</v>

2189
01:37:04.311 --> 01:37:06.050
<v Speaker 2>Like a satellite?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2190
01:37:06.090 --> 01:37:07.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're called cube to cube.</v>

2191
01:37:07.301 --> 01:37:12.301
<v Speaker 2>Sat is a cube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sat is a modular box that you put</v>

2192
01:37:12.531 --> 01:37:14.480
<v Speaker 2>together as modules based on what you</v>
<v Speaker 2>need.</v>

2193
01:37:14.481 --> 01:37:15.500
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to thrust her.</v>

2194
01:37:15.710 --> 01:37:20.600
<v Speaker 2>I need a sensor and I need a fucking rf</v>
<v Speaker 2>signal thing to send the data back home.</v>

2195
01:37:20.601 --> 01:37:22.400
<v Speaker 2>So now you've got three little boxes</v>
<v Speaker 2>attached.</v>

2196
01:37:22.460 --> 01:37:24.020
<v Speaker 2>That's a cube set.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They call them cubes,</v>

2197
01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:26.790
<v Speaker 2>so it's essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2198
01:37:27.130 --> 01:37:29.990
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's probably 80 percent of the</v>

2199
01:37:29.991 --> 01:37:33.350
<v Speaker 2>satellite business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now they got to put all these cube</v>

2200
01:37:33.351 --> 01:37:38.351
<v Speaker 2>sats together on Musk's rocket that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>also launching giant satellites for dod</v>

2201
01:37:39.051 --> 01:37:42.230
<v Speaker 2>or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's super expensive because you</v>

2202
01:37:42.231 --> 01:37:44.660
<v Speaker 2>have a rocket and you have all that</v>
<v Speaker 2>fossil fuels and all this stuff.</v>

2203
01:37:44.930 --> 01:37:47.990
<v Speaker 2>If he launched these cube sats with</v>
<v Speaker 2>lasers because they're not that heavy</v>

2204
01:37:47.991 --> 01:37:49.790
<v Speaker 2>and you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

2205
01:37:49.791 --> 01:37:51.380
<v Speaker 2>it would take a cost of launching a</v>
<v Speaker 2>cube,</v>

2206
01:37:51.381 --> 01:37:54.530
<v Speaker 2>sat from 50 grand a pound down to five</v>
<v Speaker 2>grand.</v>

2207
01:37:54.860 --> 01:37:57.000
<v Speaker 2>That's huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's the video of this actually</v>

2208
01:37:57.001 --> 01:37:57.930
<v Speaker 2>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's on your,</v>

2209
01:37:57.931 --> 01:38:01.180
<v Speaker 2>what is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the Stars Academy Dot Com is.</v>

2210
01:38:01.450 --> 01:38:05.130
<v Speaker 2>And you can watch the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can watch the video and then you go</v>

2211
01:38:05.131 --> 01:38:08.070
<v Speaker 2>to the entertainment division,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is my primary spot.</v>

2212
01:38:08.510 --> 01:38:09.770
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2213
01:38:09.810 --> 01:38:13.230
<v Speaker 2>making movies and selling millions of</v>
<v Speaker 2>books and licensing this stuff out is</v>

2214
01:38:13.231 --> 01:38:15.660
<v Speaker 2>the diff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the reason why Disney's $300 billion</v>

2215
01:38:15.661 --> 01:38:18.900
<v Speaker 2>in warner brothers is 5 billion warner</v>
<v Speaker 2>brothers just makes movies.</v>

2216
01:38:19.200 --> 01:38:22.140
<v Speaker 2>Disease makes they make franchises and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're vertically integrated.</v>

2217
01:38:22.141 --> 01:38:24.060
<v Speaker 2>We put up the book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we put out the t shirts,</v>

2218
01:38:24.061 --> 01:38:27.030
<v Speaker 2>we make the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's really where we're going.</v>

2219
01:38:27.090 --> 01:38:28.260
<v Speaker 2>And we have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2220
01:38:28.710 --> 01:38:33.710
<v Speaker 2>we have three television series that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably one of which will be announced</v>

2221
01:38:35.011 --> 01:38:36.030
<v Speaker 2>probably in the next couple of weeks.</v>

2222
01:38:36.030 --> 01:38:37.830
<v Speaker 2>The other two were a little further out</v>
<v Speaker 2>on that.</v>

2223
01:38:38.190 --> 01:38:39.310
<v Speaker 2>The first film,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2224
01:38:39.320 --> 01:38:41.340
<v Speaker 2>our first film is first quarter of next</v>
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>

2225
01:38:41.590 --> 01:38:45.030
<v Speaker 2>I wrote that one and I'll be directing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That one's called strange times,</v>

2226
01:38:45.031 --> 01:38:48.630
<v Speaker 2>which is like a hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our version of the goonies but funny but</v>

2227
01:38:48.660 --> 01:38:51.750
<v Speaker 2>scary and fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But with 17 and 18 year old kids,</v>

2228
01:38:52.140 --> 01:38:53.490
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>

2229
01:38:53.491 --> 01:38:55.500
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then secret machines,</v>

2230
01:38:55.501 --> 01:38:56.760
<v Speaker 2>the motion picture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

2231
01:38:56.840 --> 01:38:59.940
<v Speaker 2>these are all franchises.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So strange times has an animated series</v>

2232
01:39:00.030 --> 01:39:02.970
<v Speaker 2>that's coming out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have wonderful writer from.</v>

2233
01:39:02.971 --> 01:39:03.691
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I live,</v>

2234
01:39:03.691 --> 01:39:08.040
<v Speaker 2>that's show running the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have an unscripted show coming out on</v>

2235
01:39:08.041 --> 01:39:12.570
<v Speaker 2>the entire company just following us in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a very national geographic way as we do</v>

2236
01:39:12.571 --> 01:39:15.690
<v Speaker 2>all these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as we build lasers,</v>

2237
01:39:15.691 --> 01:39:18.180
<v Speaker 2>as we're on the movie sets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as we're in the lab,</v>

2238
01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:19.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pinging that,</v>

2239
01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:20.850
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2240
01:39:20.850 --> 01:39:22.380
<v Speaker 2>those pieces of metal I told you about.</v>

2241
01:39:22.650 --> 01:39:23.371
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2242
01:39:23.371 --> 01:39:25.330
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of things like that going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2243
01:39:25.710 --> 01:39:28.260
<v Speaker 2>so when you ask about how do we monetize</v>
<v Speaker 2>all this shit,</v>

2244
01:39:28.261 --> 01:39:30.930
<v Speaker 2>we have a full functioning entertainment</v>
<v Speaker 2>division has been up for a few years.</v>

2245
01:39:31.050 --> 01:39:33.600
<v Speaker 2>That's what I've been doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's how I made the book.</v>

2246
01:39:33.601 --> 01:39:38.601
<v Speaker 2>And we've put out seven novels already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your end goal is ultimately to expose</v>

2247
01:39:40.470 --> 01:39:42.130
<v Speaker 2>all of this information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My American,</v>

2248
01:39:42.180 --> 01:39:47.180
<v Speaker 2>my end goal is not just that my end goal</v>
<v Speaker 2>is to build a company that changes the</v>

2249
01:39:48.091 --> 01:39:52.620
<v Speaker 2>world and by doing a traditional IPO in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the next five to seven years.</v>

2250
01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:55.890
<v Speaker 2>And to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I grabbed very,</v>

2251
01:39:55.891 --> 01:39:59.640
<v Speaker 2>very high ranking people from various</v>
<v Speaker 2>areas in the government to achieve all</v>

2252
01:39:59.641 --> 01:40:00.790
<v Speaker 2>this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they,</v>

2253
01:40:00.791 --> 01:40:02.370
<v Speaker 2>they don't need to come in on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>movies.</v>

2254
01:40:02.371 --> 01:40:04.110
<v Speaker 2>I have that on lock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my thing.</v>

2255
01:40:04.440 --> 01:40:08.460
<v Speaker 2>But it can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can function as a way to help people</v>

2256
01:40:08.461 --> 01:40:10.860
<v Speaker 2>understand what the fuck is going on.</v>

2257
01:40:10.860 --> 01:40:13.230
<v Speaker 2>So some of the movies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the TV series,</v>

2258
01:40:13.231 --> 01:40:17.580
<v Speaker 2>some of the nonfiction works that we do</v>
<v Speaker 2>will all be about that subject,</v>

2259
01:40:17.581 --> 01:40:19.770
<v Speaker 2>but the rest of it won't be all right</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

2260
01:40:19.860 --> 01:40:23.310
<v Speaker 2>Well that's a very ambitious project and</v>
<v Speaker 2>let us know when you're ready to go to</v>

2261
01:40:23.311 --> 01:40:26.160
<v Speaker 2>the moon or Mars or wherever the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to go.</v>

2262
01:40:27.030 --> 01:40:28.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can go to your anus all those</v>

2263
01:40:28.651 --> 01:40:30.250
<v Speaker 2>places.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2264
01:40:30.510 --> 01:40:32.130
<v Speaker 2>I hope it's all real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm excited.</v>

2265
01:40:32.220 --> 01:40:33.053
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thanks drew.</v>
