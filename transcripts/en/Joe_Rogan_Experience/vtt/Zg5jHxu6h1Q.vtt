1
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.280
<v Speaker 1>Freak bitches and it's just because he got mauled.</v>

2
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.210
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't because skill wise he was commensurate and then when floyd came back</v>

3
00:00:09.211 --> 00:00:09.811
<v Speaker 1>in the rematch,</v>

4
00:00:09.811 --> 00:00:11.400
<v Speaker 1>he just barked his face off,</v>

5
00:00:11.401 --> 00:00:14.760
<v Speaker 1>just fucked him up because he just wanted to let them know like,</v>

6
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:15.450
<v Speaker 1>look dude,</v>

7
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.610
<v Speaker 1>I barely took you seriously in that first fight.</v>

8
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.020
<v Speaker 1>Got Close,</v>

9
00:00:19.021 --> 00:00:21.150
<v Speaker 1>but it only got close because like this sloppy bra.</v>

10
00:00:21.151 --> 00:00:23.820
<v Speaker 1>And then you just put a skill clinic on them in the second fight.</v>

11
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.530
<v Speaker 1>Sacrifice wasn't even close.</v>

12
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.010
<v Speaker 1>I think that that's the only con,</v>

13
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.730
<v Speaker 1>but that's not how connor normally fight.</v>

14
00:00:29.731 --> 00:00:31.470
<v Speaker 1>Sound like a swarming face.</v>

15
00:00:31.471 --> 00:00:33.210
<v Speaker 1>First brawler type dude.</v>

16
00:00:33.211 --> 00:00:35.220
<v Speaker 1>He's a guy who's like cautious about getting hit.</v>

17
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

18
00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:36.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

19
00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:37.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm thrilled about it,</v>

20
00:00:37.671 --> 00:00:38.750
<v Speaker 2>but I'm also uh,</v>

21
00:00:38.751 --> 00:00:38.981
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

22
00:00:38.981 --> 00:00:39.290
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

23
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:40.070
<v Speaker 2>I wish,</v>

24
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:40.431
<v Speaker 2>I wish.</v>

25
00:00:40.431 --> 00:00:44.120
<v Speaker 2>I wish I knew more about your side of the tracks.</v>

26
00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.320
<v Speaker 1>Well we don't know enough about connor because connor has never had a</v>

27
00:00:47.321 --> 00:00:48.700
<v Speaker 1>professional boxing match,</v>

28
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.691
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

29
00:00:49.691 --> 00:00:51.460
<v Speaker 1>and the thing is you see as striking,</v>

30
00:00:51.461 --> 00:00:55.060
<v Speaker 1>but you only see striking when he's working on kicks and wrestling and all that</v>

31
00:00:55.061 --> 00:00:55.440
<v Speaker 1>other shit.</v>

32
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.500
<v Speaker 2>What if he just kicked him?</v>

33
00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.551
<v Speaker 2>Like would that,</v>

34
00:00:57.551 --> 00:01:00.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean just to just do it,</v>

35
00:01:00.281 --> 00:01:01.000
<v Speaker 2>just to let them know,</v>

36
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.833
<v Speaker 2>just to do it.</v>

37
00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:03.310
<v Speaker 1>That'd be fucked up.</v>

38
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:04.331
<v Speaker 1>He fucked up,</v>

39
00:01:04.331 --> 00:01:05.500
<v Speaker 1>but it would be hilarious.</v>

40
00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.910
<v Speaker 1>Laughter.</v>

41
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:06.311
<v Speaker 1>You'd probably.</v>

42
00:01:06.311 --> 00:01:08.080
<v Speaker 1>There's probably some stipulations in the contract.</v>

43
00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.760
<v Speaker 1>Say you can't get them in an arm bar</v>

44
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.993
<v Speaker 2>or choke them.</v>

45
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.650
<v Speaker 2>I think just kicking him in the head and knock him out.</v>

46
00:01:14.651 --> 00:01:17.560
<v Speaker 2>It would be worth losing all the money and then getting more money after that.</v>

47
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.140
<v Speaker 1>Imagine he would be a god folk hero.</v>

48
00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:21.760
<v Speaker 1>If they got in close,</v>

49
00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.690
<v Speaker 1>if they got any clothes and floyd was like sucking in Juke on the outside and he</v>

50
00:01:25.691 --> 00:01:29.590
<v Speaker 1>threw a jab to cover up or left high kick and that left high kick.</v>

51
00:01:29.591 --> 00:01:30.041
<v Speaker 1>Next,</v>

52
00:01:30.041 --> 00:01:30.874
<v Speaker 1>I'm just.</v>

53
00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.300
<v Speaker 1>Can you see floyd go limp and he would go limp.</v>

54
00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.100
<v Speaker 1>He'd never been high kick like that.</v>

55
00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.621
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>

56
00:01:37.621 --> 00:01:41.140
<v Speaker 1>That would be crazy because he didn't know it was coming.</v>

57
00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:42.850
<v Speaker 1>He could clip on with it.</v>

58
00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.810
<v Speaker 1>Like if you had no idea if you hit a kick behind a punch like fighter is a lot</v>

59
00:01:46.811 --> 00:01:48.790
<v Speaker 1>of fighters do to like throw a punch.</v>

60
00:01:48.791 --> 00:01:50.230
<v Speaker 1>Literally a cover your face.</v>

61
00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.720
<v Speaker 1>So the kick is behind it already and then boom,</v>

62
00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.590
<v Speaker 1>the kit comes like why your vision is already you're thinking about the next</v>

63
00:01:56.591 --> 00:01:59.890
<v Speaker 1>punch and bang the kid glance and you get chaos happens all the time.</v>

64
00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.050
<v Speaker 1>If he did that would be insane.</v>

65
00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:03.483
<v Speaker 1>Would it be worth it?</v>

66
00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.560
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't be with fuck everything up because no one would ever trust another</v>

67
00:02:08.561 --> 00:02:12.160
<v Speaker 1>fighter from mma to ever fight a boxer in a boxing match again,</v>

68
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.233
<v Speaker 1>because we've only had the.</v>

69
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.890
<v Speaker 1>The opposite happened really.</v>

70
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.950
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

71
00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:16.340
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>

72
00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.320
<v Speaker 3>she quit in a lot of people quit.</v>

73
00:02:18.321 --> 00:02:21.350
<v Speaker 3>I worked search and rescue in Alaska and Denali for years in.</v>

74
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.940
<v Speaker 3>And you'd be amazed at how many people are just like done,</v>

75
00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:26.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

76
00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.290
<v Speaker 3>just lay down and they're done because they're not rational enough to know.</v>

77
00:02:30.291 --> 00:02:33.650
<v Speaker 3>Like if I sit down and I just took this a little bitty nappy ain't getting back</v>

78
00:02:33.651 --> 00:02:33.880
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

79
00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.630
<v Speaker 3>You're taking a snap and you're done.</v>

80
00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

81
00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:36.470
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's.</v>

82
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.870
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

83
00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:37.703
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

84
00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.930
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

85
00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.530
<v Speaker 3>Now I don't like that.</v>

86
00:02:39.531 --> 00:02:42.200
<v Speaker 3>So that's a weird term.</v>

87
00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:43.940
<v Speaker 3>But with hypothermia,</v>

88
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.880
<v Speaker 3>the interesting thing that happens is you get euphoric,</v>

89
00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.870
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

90
00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.300
<v Speaker 3>You go through this stage of super cold,</v>

91
00:02:50.301 --> 00:02:50.771
<v Speaker 3>super cold,</v>

92
00:02:50.771 --> 00:02:54.170
<v Speaker 3>and your core temperature drops low enough to where you for year comes in.</v>

93
00:02:54.171 --> 00:02:58.520
<v Speaker 3>So oftentimes it was saying people we would find our undressed,</v>

94
00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:59.623
<v Speaker 3>so get hot.</v>

95
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.300
<v Speaker 3>You get warm so the gloves come off.</v>

96
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.290
<v Speaker 3>The hats come off the pants and unzipped and you know everybody's,</v>

97
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.690
<v Speaker 3>everybody's buck naked on the side of the mountain right before they die,</v>

98
00:03:08.691 --> 00:03:09.190
<v Speaker 3>before they die.</v>

99
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.540
<v Speaker 3>So I mean,</v>

100
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.010
<v Speaker 3>not that I want to go out that way,</v>

101
00:03:12.011 --> 00:03:14.170
<v Speaker 3>but I can think of worse way.</v>

102
00:03:14.171 --> 00:03:16.150
<v Speaker 3>So it gets you for it apparently.</v>

103
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:17.130
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

104
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.970
<v Speaker 3>Because we've also pull people back.</v>

105
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.490
<v Speaker 3>I've seen multiple times when we pulled people back and they discussed that,</v>

106
00:03:24.491 --> 00:03:25.330
<v Speaker 3>they described it</v>

107
00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.530
<v Speaker 3>and then we start rewarming there.</v>

108
00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.910
<v Speaker 3>Frostbite and Shit's not right after that.</v>

109
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:32.163
<v Speaker 3>That hurts.</v>

110
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:33.243
<v Speaker 3>That hurts.</v>

111
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.800
<v Speaker 3>Frostbite is so horrible to look at it too.</v>

112
00:03:35.801 --> 00:03:39.700
<v Speaker 3>It's just shoot this stuff we had to see and her fingers are still half half</v>

113
00:03:39.701 --> 00:03:40.534
<v Speaker 3>fingers are off.</v>

114
00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:42.120
<v Speaker 3>She sent me pictures.</v>

115
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.000
<v Speaker 3>She's missing fingers.</v>

116
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:44.523
<v Speaker 3>Missing tips.</v>

117
00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:45.101
<v Speaker 3>Tips.</v>

118
00:03:45.101 --> 00:03:45.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

119
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:46.360
<v Speaker 3>She's lucky.</v>

120
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.220
<v Speaker 3>Some of the Phalanges are going chopped up,</v>

121
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:50.320
<v Speaker 3>so they got her down.</v>

122
00:03:50.321 --> 00:03:53.440
<v Speaker 3>They ended up hours and hours and hours and we're tracking and we're,</v>

123
00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:54.550
<v Speaker 3>we're trying to talk to them.</v>

124
00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:56.200
<v Speaker 3>They get her down to camp four.</v>

125
00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.780
<v Speaker 3>Which does that track that you saw then?</v>

126
00:03:58.781 --> 00:04:00.340
<v Speaker 3>The trickiest part as he'll tell you.</v>

127
00:04:00.341 --> 00:04:03.310
<v Speaker 3>Because I can't tell you can't afford a camp three.</v>

128
00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

129
00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.370
<v Speaker 3>Can't afford to camp three.</v>

130
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.350
<v Speaker 3>And then camp three to camp two,</v>

131
00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.520
<v Speaker 3>which they didn't even do.</v>

132
00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:10.210
<v Speaker 3>They couldn't get.</v>

133
00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:11.410
<v Speaker 3>They couldn't get to camp two,</v>

134
00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.710
<v Speaker 3>which is straight on the LHOTSE lhotse face.</v>

135
00:04:14.711 --> 00:04:15.100
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>

136
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.710
<v Speaker 3>it's about a 60 slash 60 degree ice face,</v>

137
00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:19.780
<v Speaker 3>which is slick.</v>

138
00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.880
<v Speaker 3>So when you're roping somebody down,</v>

139
00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:23.040
<v Speaker 3>you know it,</v>

140
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.370
<v Speaker 3>it actually does provide,</v>

141
00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

142
00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:25.631
<v Speaker 3>less friction.</v>

143
00:04:25.631 --> 00:04:27.100
<v Speaker 3>You can actually slide somebody down,</v>

144
00:04:27.101 --> 00:04:29.860
<v Speaker 3>but you can't get going too fast,</v>

152
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.291

153
00:04:41.291 --> 00:04:42.220
<v Speaker 3>And these guys are working on right now.</v>

154
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.690
<v Speaker 3>She's 200 pounds.</v>

155
00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:44.553
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

156
00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:45.700
<v Speaker 3>she wasn't that big,</v>

157
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.720
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

158
00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.040
<v Speaker 3>with all our gear and all 160,</v>

159
00:04:50.041 --> 00:04:51.430

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:55.690

163
00:04:55.691 --> 00:04:59.320
<v Speaker 3>we got her down to where we could go in with a helicopter and we picked her up</v>

164
00:04:59.321 --> 00:05:02.950
<v Speaker 3>and took her back down to base camp and that was when the meeting took place</v>

165
00:05:02.951 --> 00:05:04.350
<v Speaker 3>between her and her husband,</v>

166
00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:05.021

<v Speaker 3>rejoicing.</v>

168
00:05:05.771 --> 00:05:08.920
<v Speaker 3>And so the part you missed was the helicopter landed.</v>

169
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:10.180
<v Speaker 3>It couldn't land at camp two.</v>

170
00:05:10.181 --> 00:05:12.250
<v Speaker 3>We weren't supposed to go up to 23,500,</v>

173
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.060
<v Speaker 3>I can only pick one of you.</v>

174
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.350
<v Speaker 3>And she looked at her husband and said,</v>

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:25.360
<v Speaker 3>you stay until he made his day and take the next helicopter out.</v>

176
00:05:25.361 --> 00:05:28.060

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:33.513
<v Speaker 3>She was pissed off.</v>

182
00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:34.930
<v Speaker 3>She was pissed that she got left,</v>

183
00:05:34.931 --> 00:05:36.280
<v Speaker 3>but he couldn't have carried her.</v>

184
00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:38.380
<v Speaker 3>Know that you're switching.</v>

185
00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:39.131

186
00:05:39.131 --> 00:05:40.750
<v Speaker 3>there's ways looking at it both ways.</v>

187
00:05:40.751 --> 00:05:41.740

<v Speaker 1>The comedy Magic Club,</v>

243
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:14.780
<v Speaker 1>and this is Ito from the last few years,</v>

244
00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:18.710
<v Speaker 1>and no one's ever seen any of these jokes except the people at those shows.</v>

245
00:07:18.711 --> 00:07:19.670
<v Speaker 1>He didn't do them on TV.</v>

246
00:07:19.671 --> 00:07:20.810
<v Speaker 1>He didn't do them on talk shows.</v>

247
00:07:20.811 --> 00:07:21.770
<v Speaker 1>There was no special.</v>

248
00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:25.040
<v Speaker 1>Some of the funniest jokes you ever heard.</v>

249
00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:25.903
<v Speaker 1>Just him,</v>

250
00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:27.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

251
00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:28.000
<v Speaker 1>working on the craft.</v>

252
00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:30.290
<v Speaker 1>How about be being so funny?</v>

253
00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:32.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

254
00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:33.980
<v Speaker 1>but he did a lot of notes.</v>

255
00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:34.600
<v Speaker 1>He was a,</v>

256
00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:35.540
<v Speaker 1>his discipline guy.</v>

257
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.880
<v Speaker 1>He was in the seventies.</v>

258
00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:39.800
<v Speaker 1>He wrote so many jokes.</v>

259
00:07:39.801 --> 00:07:41.150
<v Speaker 1>I found these binders,</v>

260
00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:45.650
<v Speaker 1>hundreds and hundreds of jokes in every loose leaf binder,</v>

261
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:50.270
<v Speaker 1>like a guy sitting at a desk all day just crafting like two sentence.</v>

262
00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:52.550
<v Speaker 1>Perfect jokes.</v>

263
00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:52.791
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

264
00:07:52.791 --> 00:07:53.870
<v Speaker 1>But there's like the balance,</v>

265
00:07:53.871 --> 00:07:54.141
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

266
00:07:54.141 --> 00:07:54.770
<v Speaker 1>There's that.</v>

267
00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:58.250
<v Speaker 1>There's crafting the perfect jokes and then there's just being able to be loose</v>

268
00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:00.860
<v Speaker 1>and fun and hilarious.</v>

269
00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:01.371
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

270
00:08:01.371 --> 00:08:03.200
<v Speaker 1>he also used to go on stage with a,</v>

271
00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:07.190
<v Speaker 1>just a setup and he wouldn't know the punchline and he would say the setup and</v>

272
00:08:07.191 --> 00:08:08.390
<v Speaker 1>hope the punchline came,</v>

273
00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:10.820
<v Speaker 1>which was pretty wild.</v>

274
00:08:10.821 --> 00:08:11.121
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

275
00:08:11.121 --> 00:08:11.954
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

276

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

277
00:08:13.071 --> 00:08:13.600
<v Speaker 1>one of the,</v>

278
00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:16.550
<v Speaker 1>one of the great things about doing a documentary as you get to ask people for</v>

279
00:08:16.551 --> 00:08:17.091
<v Speaker 1>footage,</v>

280
00:08:17.091 --> 00:08:19.130
<v Speaker 1>so Seinfeld gave me,</v>

281
00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:20.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

282
00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:24.410
<v Speaker 1>the dailies for Comedians in cars getting coffee when he interviewed Gary.</v>

283
00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:28.850
<v Speaker 1>And then the people who made the movie comedian about Seinfeld gave me all the</v>

284
00:08:28.851 --> 00:08:33.620
<v Speaker 1>dailies of a sequence that they only use 10 seconds of the documentary,</v>

285
00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:38.480
<v Speaker 1>which was Gary and Jerry going to the comedy magic club and doing sets.</v>

286
00:08:38.481 --> 00:08:43.481
<v Speaker 1>And also there that night as Neil and Chris Rock and there's 12 tapes.</v>

287
00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:45.440
<v Speaker 1>It's all their performances.</v>

288
00:08:45.441 --> 00:08:50.441
<v Speaker 1>And then their entire conversation for three hours hanging out backstage and it</v>

289
00:08:50.781 --> 00:08:53.090
<v Speaker 1>is unbelievable the conversation,</v>

290
00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:54.530
<v Speaker 1>how funny it is.</v>

291
00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:55.940
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

292
00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:01.760
<v Speaker 1>there's a moment where Chris rock is doing the joke about how Nelson Mandela got</v>

293
00:09:02.371 --> 00:09:03.300
<v Speaker 1>divorced,</v>

294
00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:04.830
<v Speaker 1>that even Nelson Mandela,</v>

295
00:09:04.831 --> 00:09:06.960
<v Speaker 1>after decades of being in prison,</v>

296
00:09:06.961 --> 00:09:07.830
<v Speaker 1>he could survive that,</v>

297
00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.710
<v Speaker 1>but he couldn't survive getting out and being married,</v>

298
00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:11.940
<v Speaker 1>divorced immediately.</v>

299
00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.410
<v Speaker 1>I forget how he worded it,</v>

300
00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:18.920
<v Speaker 1>but there's a shot of shandling alone in a green room watching rock do this bit.</v>

301
00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:21.030
<v Speaker 1>And as he's doing it,</v>

302
00:09:21.031 --> 00:09:24.030
<v Speaker 1>Gary's saying what he,</v>

303
00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:25.520
<v Speaker 1>what he's like,</v>

304
00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:29.220
<v Speaker 1>he's guessing what the bit is as rock saying it,</v>

305
00:09:29.221 --> 00:09:32.310
<v Speaker 1>but in all of Chris Rock and it's a,</v>

306
00:09:32.311 --> 00:09:34.920
<v Speaker 1>it's a really beautiful moment.</v>

307
00:09:34.921 --> 00:09:37.480
<v Speaker 1>And that's what the best part of doing this documentary is.</v>

308
00:09:37.481 --> 00:09:41.430
<v Speaker 1>It just finding little magical moments that no one would ever see if you didn't</v>

309
00:09:41.431 --> 00:09:41.970
<v Speaker 1>dig deep.</v>
