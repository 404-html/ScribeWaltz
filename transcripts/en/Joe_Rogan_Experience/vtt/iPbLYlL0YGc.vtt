00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:02.880
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches,</v>

2
00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:07.190
<v Speaker 2>and and the thing is there's this</v>
<v Speaker 2>illusion of stability.</v>

3
00:00:07.191 --> 00:00:09.860
<v Speaker 2>There's the solution that because the</v>
<v Speaker 2>system is so big,</v>

4
00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.760
<v Speaker 2>it can't possibly be for your child,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the truth is exactly the opposite.</v>

5
00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.650
<v Speaker 2>It has become incredibly fragile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is extremely overextended and</v>

6
00:00:18.651 --> 00:00:20.150
<v Speaker 2>extremely fragile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you see the,</v>

7
00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.750
<v Speaker 2>the Federal Reserve at the moment has</v>
<v Speaker 2>been pumping money into the economy like</v>

8
00:00:23.751 --> 00:00:26.720
<v Speaker 2>crazy for five years and as they do</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

9
00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.080
<v Speaker 2>you get diminishing returns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so every here they put the same amount</v>

10
00:00:30.081 --> 00:00:32.510
<v Speaker 2>of money in and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they move the economy,</v>

11
00:00:32.511 --> 00:00:36.230
<v Speaker 2>they moved the stock market a bit less</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they put more money in and it</v>

12
00:00:36.231 --> 00:00:40.460
<v Speaker 2>moves a bit lesson until they're putting</v>
<v Speaker 2>money in just to keep it stable.</v>

13
00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.530
<v Speaker 2>Now I've seen that pattern before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that looks like a cocaine habit</v>

14
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:51.740
<v Speaker 2>right</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the first year,</v>

15
00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.130
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The coke addict is snorting a lot of</v>

16
00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.180
<v Speaker 2>free Federal Reserve money and the stock</v>
<v Speaker 2>market's getting really high.</v>

17
00:00:59.181 --> 00:01:00.800
<v Speaker 2>Indeed's bye bye.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here.</v>

18
00:01:00.801 --> 00:01:04.520
<v Speaker 2>Five it takes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It takes a big fat line of Federal</v>

19
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.370
<v Speaker 2>Reserve money just just to keep the</v>
<v Speaker 2>stock market from crashing in the</v>

20
00:01:07.371 --> 00:01:12.290
<v Speaker 2>morning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then one day which happened in mid</v>

21
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.290
<v Speaker 2>October,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Federal Reserve turned off the tap a</v>

22
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.720
<v Speaker 2>month ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Federal Reserve stopped giving out free</v>

23
00:01:20.721 --> 00:01:23.390
<v Speaker 2>money to the banks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We haven't seen the effect that will</v>

24
00:01:23.391 --> 00:01:26.690
<v Speaker 2>have in the stock market,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you follow your cocaine addict</v>

25
00:01:26.691 --> 00:01:29.570
<v Speaker 2>analysis</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now,</v>

26
00:01:29.571 --> 00:01:32.630
<v Speaker 2>that addict is Jonesing for a hit and is</v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

27
00:01:32.631 --> 00:01:35.780
<v Speaker 2>really cranky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some bad things could happen.</v>

28
00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.720
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are about seven to eight months</v>

29
00:01:38.721 --> 00:01:42.680
<v Speaker 1>away from sucking trucker dicks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's really what's going on.</v>

30
00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:43.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are about.</v>

31
00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.630
<v Speaker 1>They're about that far away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people like super</v>

32
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.710
<v Speaker 1>pumped up to start a revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're walking into trader Joe's,</v>

33
00:01:51.711 --> 00:01:55.040
<v Speaker 1>clapping their hands saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't stop the revolution.</v>

34
00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.980
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking videos of these morons.</v>

35
00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:03.160
<v Speaker 1>And it's usually like menopausal women</v>
<v Speaker 1>dudes with aimless shiftless minds.</v>

36
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.490
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that there's something wrong with</v>

37
00:02:07.491 --> 00:02:08.840
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're out there walking through</v>

38
00:02:08.841 --> 00:02:11.370
<v Speaker 1>supermarkets yelling at people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people just trying.</v>

39
00:02:11.371 --> 00:02:13.710
<v Speaker 1>And you can't stop the revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

40
00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.150
<v Speaker 1>what revolution is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The revolution that interrupts shopping</v>

41
00:02:17.151 --> 00:02:18.680
<v Speaker 1>with shitty singing revolution</v>

42
00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.680
<v Speaker 3>can have affordable yogurt and fresh</v>
<v Speaker 3>fruits,</v>

43
00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.490
<v Speaker 1>privileges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's this thing of doing nothing but</v>

44
00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.130
<v Speaker 1>making a lot of energy and sound by</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it.</v>

45
00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.490
<v Speaker 1>Like I get that you're upset about</v>
<v Speaker 1>police brutality.</v>

46
00:02:30.491 --> 00:02:32.680
<v Speaker 1>I get that you're upset about the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>this country's going.</v>

47
00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.290
<v Speaker 1>I get the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But going through trader Joe's,</v>

48
00:02:35.291 --> 00:02:38.770
<v Speaker 1>clapping your hands is in fixing a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking thing because just going to</v>

49
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.500
<v Speaker 1>alienate people to whatever dumb idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have.</v>

50
00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:43.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

51
00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.080
<v Speaker 3>there was a woman in Venice beach who</v>
<v Speaker 3>came up to me recently and asked me to</v>

52
00:02:47.081 --> 00:02:49.540
<v Speaker 3>sign our petition to run for president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's gonna run.</v>

53
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was Kinda like,</v>

54
00:02:51.011 --> 00:02:52.420
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't you maybe you want to start with</v>

55
00:02:52.421 --> 00:02:54.250
<v Speaker 3>like a youtube channel or something</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

56
00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.270
<v Speaker 3>who the fuck are you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

57
00:02:55.271 --> 00:02:59.410
<v Speaker 3>you can't just leap right to president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she had a few signatures and was so</v>

58
00:02:59.411 --> 00:03:00.460
<v Speaker 3>serious about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

59
00:03:00.461 --> 00:03:01.450
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the platform?</v>

60
00:03:01.451 --> 00:03:03.490
<v Speaker 3>And she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to eliminate homelessness in</v>

61
00:03:03.491 --> 00:03:05.320
<v Speaker 3>Venice beach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was thinking like,</v>

62
00:03:05.321 --> 00:03:07.120
<v Speaker 3>that's not really a national platform,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

63
00:03:07.121 --> 00:03:08.230
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna become president and be</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

64
00:03:08.231 --> 00:03:10.960
<v Speaker 3>we have to address the five homeless</v>
<v Speaker 3>people right here.</v>

65
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.003
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

66
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.990
<v Speaker 3>my point though is I think that people</v>
<v Speaker 3>think that they have to change something</v>

67
00:03:16.991 --> 00:03:20.440
<v Speaker 3>and they have to do something because</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can see all the problems around</v>

68
00:03:20.441 --> 00:03:22.630
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And for some people that's let's go to a</v>

69
00:03:22.631 --> 00:03:25.480
<v Speaker 3>protest or let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's run for office or let's,</v>

70
00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's just start a petition no matter</v>

71
00:03:27.281 --> 00:03:32.230
<v Speaker 3>how ridiculous it sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the sad reality is revolution is</v>

72
00:03:32.231 --> 00:03:35.650
<v Speaker 3>silent nowadays.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the people who are online buying</v>

73
00:03:35.651 --> 00:03:40.651
<v Speaker 3>bitcoin and developing these other coins</v>
<v Speaker 3>are creating more of a revolution than</v>

74
00:03:41.321 --> 00:03:43.000
<v Speaker 3>anybody in the trader Joe's on a</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tuesday.</v>

75
00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.460
<v Speaker 1>But I feel like that's the type of shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>that like when you almost start dressing</v>

76
00:03:46.461 --> 00:03:49.160
<v Speaker 1>like a chick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you actually get more pussy,</v>

77
00:03:49.161 --> 00:03:51.250
<v Speaker 1>like more women coming in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that rock star thing that in,</v>

78
00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.010
<v Speaker 1>in this fucking lucky you start</v>
<v Speaker 1>borrowing their clothes and next ain't</v>

79
00:03:54.011 --> 00:03:54.844
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're blowing you.</v>

80
00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.480
<v Speaker 1>Once I heard it went well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's really funny is that an hit</v>

81
00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:02.330
<v Speaker 1>parade is pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Judas priest started a lot of the</v>

82
00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.100
<v Speaker 1>metal stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rob Halford,</v>

<v Speaker 1>snm dressing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>snam dressing and people didn't realize</v>

<v Speaker 1>I had no idea rob hoffer was gay as</v>

85

<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he got all these guys to essentially</v>

86
00:04:13.221 --> 00:04:16.150

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>brilliant,</v>

88
00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.020
<v Speaker 1>but that's so much of a bad</v>

<v Speaker 1>at.</v>

106
00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:16.010
<v Speaker 1>Like there was no one like him before</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he was such a combination of</v>

107
00:05:16.011 --> 00:05:20.810
<v Speaker 1>like masculinity and femininity and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>never noticed any of that.</v>
