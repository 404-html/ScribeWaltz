<v Speaker 1>Byron bowers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ladies and gentlemen.</v>

2
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:05.430
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on?</v>

3
00:00:05.431 --> 00:00:06.750
<v Speaker 1>What's up brother?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

4
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.400
<v Speaker 1>thank you for having me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My pleasure.</v>

5
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.770
<v Speaker 1>What's the latest and the greatest with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Byron?</v>

6
00:00:10.771 --> 00:00:12.150
<v Speaker 1>You've been traveling all over the</v>
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>

7
00:00:12.151 --> 00:00:13.860
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Check your instagram out.</v>

8
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.220
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just got back from the Dominican</v>

9
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.220
<v Speaker 1>Republic a few days ago and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a very interesting experience.</v>

10
00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:25.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

11
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.960
<v Speaker 1>Like anytime you go somewhere tropical</v>
<v Speaker 1>you like,</v>

12
00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:29.280
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this place is beautiful.</v>

13
00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.280
<v Speaker 1>And then by the third day he'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

14
00:00:32.281 --> 00:00:34.830
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is horrible politics.</v>

15
00:00:34.831 --> 00:00:36.280
<v Speaker 1>The way they treat people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

16
00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.380
<v Speaker 1>So you see the balance of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

17
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.680
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially as a,</v>

18
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:41.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

19
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.730
<v Speaker 1>being from where I'm from and being</v>
<v Speaker 1>black and what's going on,</v>

20
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm always in exotic places when cops</v>
<v Speaker 1>are killing black people.</v>

21
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.950
<v Speaker 1>So it pulls you out of the situation and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it lets you see how fucked up things or</v>

22
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.710
<v Speaker 1>for like the Haitian people.</v>

23
00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.400
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean at pretty much every third world</v>

24
00:00:59.401 --> 00:01:02.730
<v Speaker 1>country deals with all kinds of fucked</v>
<v Speaker 1>up shit.</v>

25
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like way worse than we have it here.</v>

26
00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:06.780
<v Speaker 1>It puts things into perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

27
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.020
<v Speaker 1>I often think like if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if United States wasn't established just</v>

28
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.550
<v Speaker 1>a few hundred years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that didn't happen,</v>

29
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.020
<v Speaker 1>like what would the world be like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what would most of the world be</v>

30
00:01:19.021 --> 00:01:20.970
<v Speaker 1>like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of these countries that you visit</v>

31
00:01:20.971 --> 00:01:24.390
<v Speaker 1>where you deal with insane police</v>
<v Speaker 1>corruption.</v>

32
00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.060
<v Speaker 1>Like I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had friends that have been pulled</v>

33
00:01:27.061 --> 00:01:29.720
<v Speaker 1>over in Mexico and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

34
00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.250
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cops basically just straight up tell</v>

35
00:01:32.251 --> 00:01:34.710
<v Speaker 1>you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you want to get out of this?</v>

36
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.030
<v Speaker 1>Give me some fucking money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I had a situation like that</v>

37
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.170
<v Speaker 1>coming through Tsa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't realize until they let me</v>

38
00:01:43.171 --> 00:01:45.870
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they held me for a long time where,</v>

39
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Dominican Republic because I had on a</v>

40
00:01:48.901 --> 00:01:52.140
<v Speaker 1>button up shirt that's denim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the one I'm wearing now.</v>

41
00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.530
<v Speaker 1>And they was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take your jacket off and I'm precheck.</v>

42
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.170
<v Speaker 1>So when he would come precheck it's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a white privilege.</v>

43
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.030
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not taking off my shoes.</v>

44
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.190
<v Speaker 1>This is not a jacket.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a shirt.</v>

45
00:02:02.191 --> 00:02:03.790
<v Speaker 1>So in the Dominican Republic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

46
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.720
<v Speaker 1>doing this and I'm flying out on glasses</v>
<v Speaker 1>and stuff.</v>

47
00:02:06.721 --> 00:02:08.130
<v Speaker 1>And they was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

48
00:02:08.131 --> 00:02:09.570
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh it's a shirt,</v>

49
00:02:09.571 --> 00:02:10.740
<v Speaker 1>huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come through.</v>

50
00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.500
<v Speaker 1>And then as soon as I came through there</v>
<v Speaker 1>was like this your bag.</v>

51
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.930
<v Speaker 1>And he started trying to take my cologne</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

52
00:02:15.931 --> 00:02:16.770
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's flammable.</v>

53
00:02:16.771 --> 00:02:19.750
<v Speaker 1>You can't take that on a plane or my</v>
<v Speaker 1>umbrella,</v>

54
00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.870
<v Speaker 1>you can't take umbrellas on the plane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a weapon.</v>

55
00:02:21.871 --> 00:02:24.900
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they just held me there and we just</v>

56
00:02:24.901 --> 00:02:26.430
<v Speaker 1>made eye contact with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

57
00:02:26.431 --> 00:02:28.920
<v Speaker 1>show me on the chart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all I kept saying.</v>

58
00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.840
<v Speaker 1>And then after awhile they was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

59
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.660
<v Speaker 1>you can take it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

60
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.370
<v Speaker 1>So after a while they just gave up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

61
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.690
<v Speaker 1>they gave up because I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

62
00:02:36.691 --> 00:02:38.370
<v Speaker 1>if I check the bag can I take</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything?</v>

63
00:02:38.371 --> 00:02:39.204
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

64
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.210
<v Speaker 1>so what I did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I unloaded all my bags and start</v>

65
00:02:42.211 --> 00:02:46.470
<v Speaker 1>rearranging things so I could put it so</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can check it,</v>

66
00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.100
<v Speaker 1>can make it back to America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But once they saw me doing that and they</v>

67
00:02:50.101 --> 00:02:53.080
<v Speaker 1>saw how neat I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like every time they touched somebody</v>

68
00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.620
<v Speaker 1>had to put it back a certain way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They like it.</v>

69
00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.960
<v Speaker 1>It's just going to be a waste of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even us.</v>

70
00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but don't they have rules?</v>

71
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.880
<v Speaker 1>We have rules as far as like how many</v>
<v Speaker 1>ounces of liquid and stuff like that you</v>

72
00:03:03.881 --> 00:03:05.650
<v Speaker 1>could take on a plane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do,</v>

73
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.460
<v Speaker 1>but it made it over there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's why I was trying to get them</v>

74
00:03:09.461 --> 00:03:13.990
<v Speaker 1>to explain to me like why exactly it</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably made it over there because the</v>

75
00:03:13.991 --> 00:03:17.830
<v Speaker 1>people that work at Tsa over here</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking barely paying attention.</v>

76
00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.290
<v Speaker 1>Well you take it everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I take it everywhere.</v>

77
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.930
<v Speaker 1>But how big is your Cologne?</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all?</v>

78
00:03:22.931 --> 00:03:25.390
<v Speaker 1>Clones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stinky man when we were in that I love.</v>

79
00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.790
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you disagree with Cologne.</v>

80
00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.630
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a great political point.</v>

81
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.510
<v Speaker 1>Disagree with Cologne.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You more Alpha though.</v>

82
00:03:34.511 --> 00:03:36.880
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can choke them out with your muscles</v>

83
00:03:36.881 --> 00:03:39.490
<v Speaker 1>and I could choke them with the smell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm</v>

84
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.570
<v Speaker 1>not exactly sure where to go with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>

85
00:03:43.571 --> 00:03:48.010
<v Speaker 1>So how big is the Cologne?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're like three point something</v>

86
00:03:48.011 --> 00:03:48.850
<v Speaker 1>ounces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

87
00:03:48.851 --> 00:03:51.700
<v Speaker 1>So I think you could bring on like four</v>
<v Speaker 1>ounces of liquid.</v>

88
00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:52.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that how it works?</v>

89
00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.640
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Toiletry bag.</v>

90
00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:56.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a total tree back.</v>

91
00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.290
<v Speaker 1>Now mind you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

92
00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.310
<v Speaker 1>I kept,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went from Montreal to some from</v>

93
00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.500
<v Speaker 1>Montreal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from New York and Montreal here to</v>

94
00:04:02.501 --> 00:04:05.630
<v Speaker 1>Dominican Republic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this same luggage has been like</v>

95
00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:06.483
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>

96
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.610
<v Speaker 1>So what were you doing down in Dominican</v>
<v Speaker 1>Republic?</v>

97
00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.770
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I met up with some friends of mine from</v>

98
00:04:11.771 --> 00:04:15.160
<v Speaker 1>college,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some African homeboys and I hopped in on</v>

99
00:04:15.161 --> 00:04:20.010
<v Speaker 1>their trip because they visit the Dr Lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I wanted to see what it was like and</v>

100
00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.890
<v Speaker 1>I snuck it a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I came back sore.</v>

101
00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.290
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a lot of time in the water</v>

102
00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.470
<v Speaker 1>morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>evening and like late afternoon.</v>

103
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.270
<v Speaker 1>What's beautiful for that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

104
00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:33.700
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the cool things about this</v>
<v Speaker 1>tropical climates,</v>

105
00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.260
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the oceans down,</v>

106
00:04:35.261 --> 00:04:36.730
<v Speaker 1>they're amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ocean.</v>

107
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.380
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of the reefs wasn't as you know,</v>

108
00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.100
<v Speaker 1>not like when I was in Jamaica or when</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

109
00:04:45.101 --> 00:04:48.640
<v Speaker 1>like in Hawaii where everything just</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes alive and it looks at the city,</v>

110
00:04:48.641 --> 00:04:52.870
<v Speaker 1>but it definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do feel like you landed on another</v>

111
00:04:52.871 --> 00:04:56.950
<v Speaker 1>planet to me and you're flying like I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>cruising over,</v>

112
00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:58.780
<v Speaker 1>you know the terrain.</v>

113
00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.790
<v Speaker 1>You mean when you're swimming?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I swim?</v>

114
00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anytime I snorkeled like it's that it's</v>

115
00:05:03.101 --> 00:05:06.160
<v Speaker 1>that other world experience to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah man.</v>

116
00:05:06.161 --> 00:05:10.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big fan of the water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the sharks fuck it up for me.</v>

117
00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just not going to get neat.</v>

118
00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.410
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing about it.</v>

119
00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.640
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I keep looking around like</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if it's not a lot of things</v>

120
00:05:18.641 --> 00:05:23.050
<v Speaker 1>in the water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I saw squared that was the most</v>

121
00:05:23.051 --> 00:05:28.051
<v Speaker 1>beautiful thing I saw from this trip was</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like 40 baby squid all lined up in</v>

122
00:05:28.121 --> 00:05:31.660
<v Speaker 1>a row</v>
<v Speaker 1>that looked like they'd just been born,</v>

123
00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:35.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Popo and they were just there and I</v>

124
00:05:35.141 --> 00:05:38.780
<v Speaker 1>didn't even know they was squid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was like fish with interest</v>

125
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.190
<v Speaker 1>in his fans because it looked like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

126
00:05:41.191 --> 00:05:43.180
<v Speaker 1>like a lady just doing her dress like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

127
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.960
<v Speaker 1>When I got close I could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I realized that I was at a tentacle part</v>

128
00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:49.630
<v Speaker 1>a and I was just locked eyes with him</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>

129
00:05:49.631 --> 00:05:50.920
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the most beautiful thing.</v>

130
00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:52.300
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Duncan trussell.</v>

131
00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dunkin has this new virtual reality</v>

132
00:05:55.301 --> 00:05:56.860
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a virtual,</v>

133
00:05:56.861 --> 00:05:58.310
<v Speaker 1>it's an htv</v>

134
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:00.320
<v Speaker 2>vive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

135
00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:05.290
<v Speaker 2>you put it on and you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you actually feel like you're</v>

136
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.150
<v Speaker 2>underwater.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have this program because I think</v>

137
00:06:08.151 --> 00:06:09.830
<v Speaker 2>it's called deep blue or something like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

138
00:06:09.831 --> 00:06:11.220
<v Speaker 2>Something blue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

139
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:16.720
<v Speaker 2>but you put it on and one of the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reality programs that you put on is an</v>

140
00:06:17.061 --> 00:06:21.890
<v Speaker 2>ocean one and you're standing at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>bottom of this like ocean area and these</v>

141
00:06:21.891 --> 00:06:26.891
<v Speaker 2>fish swim by and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a hundred percent realistic</v>

142
00:06:27.141 --> 00:06:29.150
<v Speaker 2>because the graphics on totally there</v>
<v Speaker 2>yet,</v>

143
00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:34.690
<v Speaker 2>but it's like 85 percent realistic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as amazing a whale pulls up to you</v>

144
00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:37.700
<v Speaker 2>and you get to look at the whale,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you look in his eyes.</v>

145
00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:40.310
<v Speaker 2>But like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno if you've ever used any kind of</v>

146
00:06:40.311 --> 00:06:41.840
<v Speaker 2>virtual reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty new to it too,</v>

147
00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.950
<v Speaker 2>but you get a full 360 degrees so you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can look down,</v>

148
00:06:45.951 --> 00:06:47.450
<v Speaker 2>you can look up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can look everywhere.</v>

149
00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:49.460
<v Speaker 2>So this whale,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as it's in front of you,</v>

150
00:06:49.461 --> 00:06:52.070
<v Speaker 2>you could choose different spots on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>whale that you look at it,</v>

151
00:06:52.071 --> 00:06:54.170
<v Speaker 2>you can look at its eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can look at its tail.</v>

152
00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.890
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it lets you know that,</v>

153
00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:59.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>within a hundred years from now,</v>

154
00:06:59.601 --> 00:07:03.440
<v Speaker 2>probably not even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably more like 20 the 20 years from</v>

155
00:07:03.441 --> 00:07:04.340
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

156
00:07:04.341 --> 00:07:05.960
<v Speaker 2>this is it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this the program?</v>

157
00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.940
<v Speaker 2>So this is it right here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you,</v>

158
00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:12.170
<v Speaker 2>you stand there and you're looking</v>
<v Speaker 2>around like that dude's just looking</v>

159
00:07:12.171 --> 00:07:14.960
<v Speaker 2>around with these goggles on and this is</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're seeing.</v>

160
00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:19.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're seeing it feels like the actual</v>

161
00:07:19.431 --> 00:07:20.540
<v Speaker 2>ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

162
00:07:20.541 --> 00:07:21.374
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

163
00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:24.490
<v Speaker 2>that's basically what it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's basically what it looks and feels</v>

164
00:07:24.491 --> 00:07:27.620
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's beautiful right there.</v>

165
00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:33.330
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy that that's what is it like</v>
<v Speaker 2>79 percent of the earth or some point</v>

166
00:07:33.331 --> 00:07:34.800
<v Speaker 2>that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

167
00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:35.810
<v Speaker 2>we looked it up the other day.</v>

168
00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:40.810
<v Speaker 2>It was over 70 percent of the earth is</v>
<v Speaker 2>water and 95 percent of that is ocean</v>

169
00:07:41.511 --> 00:07:45.290
<v Speaker 2>water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing because almost like how</v>

170
00:07:45.291 --> 00:07:47.150
<v Speaker 2>they say our bodies are made up of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same.</v>

171
00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:50.120
<v Speaker 2>Not Quite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a bodies like 60 percent.</v>

172
00:07:50.121 --> 00:07:52.220
<v Speaker 2>They used to say it was like 90 percent</v>
<v Speaker 2>water,</v>

173
00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:55.430
<v Speaker 2>so finding out what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the human body is actually only</v>

174
00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:58.190
<v Speaker 2>60 percent water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

175
00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:00.810
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I've,</v>

176
00:08:00.811 --> 00:08:02.570
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've experienced virtual reality,</v>

177
00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:04.940
<v Speaker 2>the one where you could just travel</v>
<v Speaker 2>everywhere around the world.</v>

178
00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:09.970
<v Speaker 2>60th five average human bodies between</v>
<v Speaker 2>50 and 65 percent water averaging around</v>

179
00:08:11.511 --> 00:08:16.100
<v Speaker 2>57 to 60 percent average percentage of</v>
<v Speaker 2>water and infants as much higher</v>

180
00:08:16.101 --> 00:08:19.000
<v Speaker 2>typically around 75 to 78 percent water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

181
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:22.130
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dropping into 65 by one year of age.</v>

182
00:08:22.131 --> 00:08:26.690
<v Speaker 2>A little water balloons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably why the scan gets crazy.</v>

183
00:08:26.691 --> 00:08:29.960
<v Speaker 2>Like the older we get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the water's drop it in,</v>

184
00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:32.900
<v Speaker 2>drop it in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then like I said,</v>

185
00:08:32.901 --> 00:08:34.760
<v Speaker 2>the percentage goes down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The older you get.</v>

186
00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:37.760
<v Speaker 2>Oh Man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he probably just drinking too much.</v>

187
00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:40.520
<v Speaker 2>He'll get wrinkles and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's actually Collagen.</v>

188
00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:42.343
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

189
00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:46.760
<v Speaker 2>that's the wrinkle thing is the last set</v>
<v Speaker 2>of your skin gives out your body stops</v>

190
00:08:46.761 --> 00:08:50.060
<v Speaker 2>producing college incorrectly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can mitigate some of that</v>

191
00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:53.120
<v Speaker 2>moisture and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people use creams and shit like</v>

192
00:08:53.121 --> 00:08:54.200
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at the end of the day,</v>

193
00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:56.220
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>time when</v>

194
00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:58.230
<v Speaker 1>certain ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I definitely use creams.</v>

195
00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:01.910
<v Speaker 1>I use cranes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you clone?</v>

196
00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:05.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the things that stink things.</v>

197
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:08.610
<v Speaker 1>Well I can't use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't use dyes and perfumes and</v>

198
00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:10.790
<v Speaker 1>lotions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How come it,</v>

199
00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:13.320
<v Speaker 1>it makes my skin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it dries my skin out and make it break</v>

200
00:09:13.321 --> 00:09:16.000
<v Speaker 1>out perfumes and lotions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you can work alone.</v>

201
00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:16.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wear Cologne,</v>

202
00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:20.100
<v Speaker 1>Cologne last,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a certain amount of hours and it lands</v>

203
00:09:20.101 --> 00:09:21.210
<v Speaker 1>on your skin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

204
00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at you.</v>

205
00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:25.060
<v Speaker 1>You clump correctional Atlanta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scared.</v>

206
00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.630
<v Speaker 1>So dedicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you always worn Cologne?</v>

207
00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:29.970
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well once I got into it,</v>

208
00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.250
<v Speaker 1>my mom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I was raised by my mom,</v>

209
00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.340
<v Speaker 1>like sense of smell is just so strong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

210
00:09:35.341 --> 00:09:40.341
<v Speaker 1>so it was always frigates around and to</v>
<v Speaker 1>me that's the first like that.</v>

211
00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:44.190
<v Speaker 1>That can alter your mindset or your</v>
<v Speaker 1>mood.</v>

212
00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:46.690
<v Speaker 1>Like when you smell something good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

213
00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:48.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an anchor.</v>

214
00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:49.520
<v Speaker 1>It'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can cause like a,</v>

215
00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:51.260
<v Speaker 1>like a mental trigger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

216
00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:53.850
<v Speaker 1>It brings you back to that place like</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain smells,</v>

217
00:09:53.851 --> 00:09:56.640
<v Speaker 1>like smell of apple pie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If your mom cooked up a pie or something</v>

218
00:09:56.641 --> 00:09:58.680
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could smell it immediately.</v>

219
00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:03.960
<v Speaker 1>Transport you back to that good place or</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad place or bad place.</v>

220
00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:05.810
<v Speaker 1>Like yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I like,</v>

221
00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:09.840
<v Speaker 1>like sexy smells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I like to be reminded of something</v>

222
00:10:09.841 --> 00:10:12.570
<v Speaker 1>that's pleasant life a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smells,</v>

223
00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:16.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I don't wear like hardcore masculine.</v>

224
00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:19.180
<v Speaker 1>But I liked the smell like a rose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you like to smell like a rose.</v>

225
00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.240
<v Speaker 1>I like to smell like something fresh</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>

226
00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:24.540
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm learning a lot about like,</v>

227
00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:26.520
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it takes me two hours to pick out my</v>

228
00:10:26.521 --> 00:10:27.510
<v Speaker 1>fragrance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

229
00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:31.950
<v Speaker 1>But hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it takes you two hours to pick out your</v>

230
00:10:31.951 --> 00:10:35.280
<v Speaker 1>fragrance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just in a day or like when you go</v>

231
00:10:35.281 --> 00:10:36.360
<v Speaker 1>to a fragrance store.</v>

232
00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:39.360
<v Speaker 1>When I went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I went to the fragrance store.</v>

233
00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:41.220
<v Speaker 1>So you're that dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just wandering around.</v>

234
00:10:41.221 --> 00:10:43.320
<v Speaker 1>They're touching this one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

235
00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:46.410
<v Speaker 1>smelling it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if I don't get like a small,</v>

236
00:10:46.411 --> 00:10:49.290
<v Speaker 1>like erection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that little erection.</v>

237
00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:51.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if it don't turn me on in a sense</v>

238
00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.370
<v Speaker 1>it's not the one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

239
00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:55.230
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just like,</v>

240
00:10:55.231 --> 00:10:57.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when you feel the energy of a lady</v>

241
00:10:57.511 --> 00:11:00.480
<v Speaker 1>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you're attracted to the sound</v>

242
00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:03.360
<v Speaker 1>of a motor when it goes by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

243
00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:05.040
<v Speaker 1>Well I'm with you on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

244
00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:07.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've said that on with engines that</v>

245
00:11:07.831 --> 00:11:10.200
<v Speaker 1>actually like when you hear an engine</v>
<v Speaker 1>revving,</v>

246
00:11:10.201 --> 00:11:13.980
<v Speaker 1>it actually raises men's testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But why?</v>

247
00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:16.710
<v Speaker 1>I wonder why it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

248
00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:20.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that anybody ever driven a</v>
<v Speaker 1>car with pipes,</v>

249
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.910
<v Speaker 1>which is rare in California that have</v>
<v Speaker 1>custom pipes.</v>

250
00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:26.830
<v Speaker 1>But you think it's rare?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

251
00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:30.660
<v Speaker 1>It'll be like for as far as like loud</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those fucking things are everywhere</v>

252
00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:31.621
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

253
00:11:31.621 --> 00:11:33.750
<v Speaker 1>They cracked down on them here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like in Georgia.</v>

254
00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:37.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm from Georgia where you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get a Honda and put in open</v>

255
00:11:37.531 --> 00:11:40.650
<v Speaker 1>exhaust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a quarter inch and take the stuff</v>

256
00:11:40.651 --> 00:11:42.360
<v Speaker 1>off us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He that stupid.</v>

257
00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:44.690
<v Speaker 1>If you've got a Honda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

258
00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:46.650
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're a four cylinder,</v>

259
00:11:46.651 --> 00:11:48.330
<v Speaker 1>that's awful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did that before,</v>

260
00:11:48.331 --> 00:11:53.331
<v Speaker 1>but my friend had a Cobra Mustang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>68 a and you can hear that car coming</v>

261
00:11:53.861 --> 00:11:54.010
<v Speaker 1>down</v>

262
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:56.440
<v Speaker 2>the street,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you hear in a real car with a</v>

263
00:11:56.441 --> 00:12:00.030
<v Speaker 2>real motor is almost like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a tiger growl in the song.</v>

264
00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:01.800
<v Speaker 2>It's just an energy that want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>release.</v>

265
00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:04.300
<v Speaker 2>When you press the gas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

266
00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:07.900
<v Speaker 2>so that it makes you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just does something to you.</v>

267
00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:11.230
<v Speaker 2>What's little explosions?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's controlled explosions</v>

268
00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:13.120
<v Speaker 2>essentially and that's what it</v>
<v Speaker 2>engineers,</v>

269
00:12:13.121 --> 00:12:16.570
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just the steel explosion container</v>

270
00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:20.230
<v Speaker 2>and all these pistons are in there and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all firing.</v>

271
00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:23.050
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As much as I know about cars.</v>

272
00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:27.220
<v Speaker 2>I really should know more about like how</v>
<v Speaker 2>engines work.</v>

273
00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:30.610
<v Speaker 2>Like I really don't know that much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of know there's some,</v>

274
00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:34.030
<v Speaker 2>I ain't gotta have cam shafts and you've</v>
<v Speaker 2>got to have some cylinders and there's a</v>

275
00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:39.360
<v Speaker 2>spark plugs and night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some shit and some fire explosions going</v>

276
00:12:39.491 --> 00:12:40.950
<v Speaker 2>off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't really know know,</v>

277
00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:43.120
<v Speaker 2>you know more about me when it comes to</v>
<v Speaker 2>cars.</v>

278
00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:46.750
<v Speaker 2>I know the simple like few air spark</v>
<v Speaker 2>gets it going.</v>

279
00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:47.550
<v Speaker 2>That's it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

280
00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:49.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The simplicity of it.</v>

281
00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:53.050
<v Speaker 2>But you are in the cars to your</v>
<v Speaker 2>conversations.</v>

282
00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:55.240
<v Speaker 2>I definitely liked them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can't get into it.</v>

283
00:12:55.241 --> 00:13:00.241
<v Speaker 2>We'll displacement and offsets and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>correct suspension and steering.</v>

284
00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:02.110
<v Speaker 2>You don't know about all that stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

285
00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:05.740
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just know what I like body shapes and</v>

286
00:13:05.741 --> 00:13:08.650
<v Speaker 2>what it feels like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But don't you enjoy like what it feels</v>

287
00:13:08.651 --> 00:13:11.800
<v Speaker 2>like when you drive them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you have a nice car when you drive</v>

288
00:13:11.801 --> 00:13:13.390
<v Speaker 2>that thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you know,</v>

289
00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:17.950
<v Speaker 2>like it has like a certain feel to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way like when you turn corners and stuff</v>

290
00:13:17.951 --> 00:13:19.870
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Certain responsiveness to it.</v>

291
00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:20.531
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>

292
00:13:20.531 --> 00:13:23.200
<v Speaker 2>I definitely know that but there's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't dial it in.</v>

293
00:13:23.201 --> 00:13:25.330
<v Speaker 2>I can't put that in a computer and be</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

294
00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:26.380
<v Speaker 2>hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

295
00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:28.930
<v Speaker 2>like I need my suspension adjusted.</v>

296
00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:32.170
<v Speaker 2>Should I go with this call?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oversell a colo visit.</v>

297
00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:34.180
<v Speaker 2>But that's the beautiful thing about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Internet.</v>

298
00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:37.690
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a bmw so you can go to a BMW</v>

299
00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:40.150
<v Speaker 2>forum and then you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

300
00:13:40.151 --> 00:13:43.630
<v Speaker 2>what is the deal with this year?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A three series.</v>

301
00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:48.970
<v Speaker 2>Like what's the best suspension set up</v>
<v Speaker 2>for handling and some some people like</v>

302
00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:51.070
<v Speaker 2>comfort,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people like handling.</v>

303
00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:55.420
<v Speaker 2>That's the real trade off is because if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you really want the car to sit flat</v>

304
00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:58.820
<v Speaker 2>around corners that it has to have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little more stiffness,</v>

305
00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:02.740
<v Speaker 2>still feel everything a little bit more</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I feel that and I liked that.</v>

306
00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:06.310
<v Speaker 2>Like I had enough for for 83,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which to me the best,</v>

307
00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:09.520
<v Speaker 2>but it was the best car or home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those portions are sweet man.</v>

308
00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:12.510
<v Speaker 2>Those are underrated cars to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>fill a cart.</v>

309
00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:15.690
<v Speaker 2>The field role do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you're on a boat was amazing.</v>

310
00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:17.260
<v Speaker 2>A lot of cars don't give you that</v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling.</v>

311
00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:21.700
<v Speaker 2>The boat feeling like you know the</v>
<v Speaker 2>street is uneven when you drive it now</v>

312
00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:24.880
<v Speaker 2>instead of just the flattest most paved</v>
<v Speaker 2>street,</v>

313
00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:27.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could feel the wave in it.</v>

314
00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:29.290
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you must have pretty stiff</v>

315
00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:30.220
<v Speaker 2>suspension.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

316
00:14:30.221 --> 00:14:31.750
<v Speaker 2>That car came like that though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

317
00:14:31.751 --> 00:14:34.720
<v Speaker 2>Well those older cars were way more</v>
<v Speaker 2>responsive.</v>

318
00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:38.560
<v Speaker 2>They were way lighter too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you go to like the really older</v>

319
00:14:38.561 --> 00:14:42.160
<v Speaker 2>porsches like the old nine slash 11.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the long hood models,</v>

320
00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:47.140
<v Speaker 2>I think it was like 65 or 64,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was two 73.</v>

321
00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:49.810
<v Speaker 2>Those models,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're really light,</v>

322
00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:51.970
<v Speaker 2>like that's a 2000 pound car a lot of</v>

323
00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:55.570
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you feel everything when you bumping</v>

324
00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:56.450
<v Speaker 1>around those things?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

325
00:14:56.451 --> 00:14:58.340
<v Speaker 1>it feels more like a go cart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

326
00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:01.700
<v Speaker 1>And that was ignorant with my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I had to buy tires for it and they</v>

327
00:15:01.701 --> 00:15:02.411
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

328
00:15:02.411 --> 00:15:04.850
<v Speaker 1>it's 83 and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's 150 horses.</v>

329
00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:06.800
<v Speaker 1>I'd take it to the tire place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>

330
00:15:06.801 --> 00:15:09.040
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need these $150 tires.</v>

331
00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:10.670
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

332
00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:11.970
<v Speaker 1>fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This car,</v>

333
00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:15.680
<v Speaker 1>the only got 150 horses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's put some van tires on it,</v>

334
00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.490
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I bought two brand new van tires.</v>

335
00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:21.890
<v Speaker 1>What's a van like times that were going</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a van.</v>

336
00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:24.440
<v Speaker 1>Why would you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it to me it's just a tire.</v>

337
00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:28.280
<v Speaker 1>Oh that's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Slot slid on the freeway or bunch of</v>

338
00:15:28.281 --> 00:15:32.720
<v Speaker 1>times just stopping and wasn't used to</v>
<v Speaker 1>not having abs.</v>

339
00:15:32.721 --> 00:15:37.130
<v Speaker 1>Automatic breaks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And every time it stumped the brakes,</v>

340
00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:40.250
<v Speaker 1>you know the car was slide on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>freeway,</v>

341
00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:43.670
<v Speaker 1>but I would stop in enough distance to</v>
<v Speaker 1>where a slot and not hit the car.</v>

342
00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:46.060
<v Speaker 1>So you had antilock brakes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

343
00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:47.390
<v Speaker 1>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have it.</v>

344
00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:50.830
<v Speaker 1>What kind of car was this not for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for those?</v>

345
00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:52.270
<v Speaker 1>Didn't have any brakes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

346
00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:55.040
<v Speaker 1>not 83.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't come to like 86.</v>

347
00:15:57.090 --> 00:15:59.780
<v Speaker 1>And you put van tires on Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

348
00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:02.030
<v Speaker 1>that's a sacrilege.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's terrible.</v>

349
00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:04.220
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was what you learned lessons,</v>

350
00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:08.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anytime you work on your car is cool,</v>

351
00:16:08.571 --> 00:16:11.360
<v Speaker 1>but you learn your lessons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You learned about Torque,</v>

352
00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:14.390
<v Speaker 1>torque,</v>
<v Speaker 1>applying torque to old cars and plastic</v>

353
00:16:14.391 --> 00:16:15.224
<v Speaker 1>pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Breaking.</v>

354
00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:17.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all types of stuff that,</v>

355
00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:19.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>antifreeze tastes like.</v>

356
00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:21.460
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any furniture,</v>

357
00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:23.720
<v Speaker 1>we drink it in the fridge for you if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't drink it,</v>

358
00:16:23.721 --> 00:16:28.721
<v Speaker 1>but you have to rework working on a leak</v>
<v Speaker 1>or changing something in drips and it</v>

359
00:16:29.901 --> 00:16:31.670
<v Speaker 1>gets in your mouth and Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

360
00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:35.330
<v Speaker 1>It is sweet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like koolaid almost doesn't really</v>

361
00:16:35.331 --> 00:16:37.700
<v Speaker 1>taste that good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have no idea.</v>

362
00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:41.300
<v Speaker 1>It looks disgusting and antifreeze looks</v>
<v Speaker 1>nasty.</v>

363
00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:42.153
<v Speaker 1>Looks like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

364
00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:45.110
<v Speaker 1>like nuclear waste or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

365
00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:49.370
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You learn your lessons with cars by.</v>

366
00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:51.650
<v Speaker 1>You still carrying those old ones.</v>

367
00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:52.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're different,</v>

368
00:16:52.731 --> 00:16:54.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can actually work on them.</v>

369
00:16:54.021 --> 00:16:56.900
<v Speaker 1>You can open up the hood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's stuff you can change and swap</v>

370
00:16:56.901 --> 00:16:59.430
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can go to pep boys or whatever by a</v>

371
00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:00.860
<v Speaker 1>part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Cars,</v>

372
00:17:00.861 --> 00:17:01.900
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You open up the hood.</v>

373
00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:05.150
<v Speaker 1>It's just like a computer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like opening up the back of a imac</v>

374
00:17:05.151 --> 00:17:05.571
<v Speaker 1>or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

375
00:17:05.571 --> 00:17:08.590
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He have no idea what the fuck's going on</v>

376
00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:10.880
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And everything's connected to some sort</v>

377
00:17:10.881 --> 00:17:11.840
<v Speaker 1>of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

378
00:17:11.841 --> 00:17:13.730
<v Speaker 1>a computer management system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

379
00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:15.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

380
00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:18.800
<v Speaker 1>three and the bemer it's three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three what?</v>

381
00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:20.390
<v Speaker 1>Three computers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

382
00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:24.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They ignition switch when you put the</v>

383
00:17:24.051 --> 00:17:26.030
<v Speaker 1>key in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talks to this module,</v>

384
00:17:26.850 --> 00:17:30.050
<v Speaker 1>reads the key code and it talks back and</v>
<v Speaker 1>allows the car to crank,</v>

385
00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:33.380
<v Speaker 1>but all they have to go through the main</v>
<v Speaker 1>computer also.</v>

386
00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:36.260
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I know that because I know Colin and</v>

387
00:17:36.261 --> 00:17:40.220
<v Speaker 1>I studied engineering for two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my senior year and I had to,</v>

388
00:17:40.221 --> 00:17:44.960
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to snatch a remote start system,</v>

389
00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:47.360
<v Speaker 1>faulty remote start system out of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>basement when I got it.</v>

390
00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:50.220
<v Speaker 1>So I had to go under the Dash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rewire everything.</v>

391
00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:51.750
<v Speaker 2>You did all that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

392
00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:53.190
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why'd you do that?</v>

393
00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:55.560
<v Speaker 2>To take it out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you did,</v>

394
00:17:55.561 --> 00:17:57.110
<v Speaker 2>you know what you were doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

395
00:17:57.111 --> 00:18:01.320
<v Speaker 2>what made you decide to embark on that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That seems like something I would want</v>

396
00:18:01.321 --> 00:18:02.530
<v Speaker 2>to take to a dealer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

397
00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:07.350
<v Speaker 2>I learned how to do install car stereos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my friend,</v>

398
00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:08.700
<v Speaker 2>when I was younger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he used to steal a car.</v>

399
00:18:08.701 --> 00:18:12.300
<v Speaker 2>Radios.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He taught me three basic things to start</v>

400
00:18:12.301 --> 00:18:14.620
<v Speaker 2>a radio is like the cars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

401
00:18:14.621 --> 00:18:19.050
<v Speaker 2>power ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could turn the radio on and the</v>

402
00:18:19.051 --> 00:18:21.570
<v Speaker 2>remote wire was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes it switched on and off.</v>

403
00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:25.470
<v Speaker 2>Would you really don't need a remote</v>
<v Speaker 2>wire at the test or radio just like you</v>

404
00:18:25.471 --> 00:18:26.910
<v Speaker 2>got jumped,</v>
<v Speaker 2>started answering.</v>

405
00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:29.400
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

406
00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:33.390
<v Speaker 2>you start to learn a pattern of things</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like the universe had patterns when</v>

407
00:18:33.391 --> 00:18:35.100
<v Speaker 2>you learn a combustion and stuff like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

408
00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:37.410
<v Speaker 2>Just the pattern is was important to me.</v>

409
00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:40.670
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

410
00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:44.450
<v Speaker 2>the universe has a pattern and then the</v>
<v Speaker 2>universe,</v>

411
00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:46.680
<v Speaker 2>because now I'm the bigger pattern</v>
<v Speaker 2>scale,</v>

412
00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:49.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the media,</v>

413
00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:50.470
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the university has a pattern of the way</v>

414
00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:52.520
<v Speaker 2>it runs to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

415
00:18:52.521 --> 00:18:54.710
<v Speaker 2>When it comes to seasons and things like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

416
00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:58.810
<v Speaker 2>The revolution of earth around the sun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

417
00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:02.720
<v Speaker 2>But</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stereo's also had that pattern.</v>

418
00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:07.700
<v Speaker 2>That's an interesting comparison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well they definitely have like whenever</v>

419
00:19:07.701 --> 00:19:10.340
<v Speaker 2>you're dealing with electronics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to have power in the ground and</v>

420
00:19:10.341 --> 00:19:12.020
<v Speaker 2>then there's a bunch of other stuff that</v>
<v Speaker 2>goes on.</v>

421
00:19:12.021 --> 00:19:13.820
<v Speaker 2>I've installed some stairs when I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>younger,</v>

422
00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:15.213
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

423
00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:17.840
<v Speaker 2>but they were easy back then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't that hard,</v>

424
00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:18.621
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there wasn't that,</v>

425
00:19:18.621 --> 00:19:21.230
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't that complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get to everything pretty easily.</v>

426
00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:25.340
<v Speaker 2>Give up the dash pretty easily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pull out the existing stereo and you</v>

427
00:19:25.341 --> 00:19:28.170
<v Speaker 2>just have to figure out where the power</v>
<v Speaker 2>is and where the wires connect.</v>

428
00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:30.530
<v Speaker 2>You tie everything up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't that hard,</v>

429
00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:33.890
<v Speaker 2>but I would never fuck with a new car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

430
00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:36.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a new lexus or something like that.</v>

431
00:19:36.051 --> 00:19:38.360
<v Speaker 2>Try to take stereo out of one of those</v>
<v Speaker 2>things was more tough.</v>

432
00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:43.390
<v Speaker 2>But if I break it down to you like this</v>
<v Speaker 2>coding and stuff is all if an statements</v>

433
00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:45.020
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If end if,</v>

434
00:19:45.021 --> 00:19:47.060
<v Speaker 2>ands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if this go there,</v>

435
00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:49.060
<v Speaker 2>go here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

436
00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:50.570
<v Speaker 2>Ones and zeroes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

437
00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:54.170
<v Speaker 2>If there's one poem here because zero</v>
<v Speaker 2>boom here and it's just a bunch of that</v>

438
00:19:54.171 --> 00:19:55.100
<v Speaker 2>going on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

439
00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:58.340
<v Speaker 2>Computing at one time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the pattern,</v>

440
00:19:58.640 --> 00:19:59.930
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

441
00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:04.380
<v Speaker 2>has it as a simple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

442
00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:06.300
<v Speaker 2>Well it's more complicated than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

443
00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:09.600
<v Speaker 2>Well it's not going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does a bunch of those all in one</v>

444
00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:12.870
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing how well these cars work</v>

445
00:20:12.871 --> 00:20:17.871
<v Speaker 2>when you really think about it because</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm like I have a lexus and I have</v>

446
00:20:18.091 --> 00:20:23.091
<v Speaker 2>a key that is actually in my wallet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a credit card and that's my key.</v>

447
00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:27.630
<v Speaker 2>So I don't ever take a key,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just get in my car and it always knows</v>

448
00:20:27.631 --> 00:20:28.880
<v Speaker 2>it's me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I come near it.</v>

449
00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:32.430
<v Speaker 2>The light goes on near the side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mirrors the side.</v>

450
00:20:32.431 --> 00:20:35.040
<v Speaker 2>Mirrors have like an underside light.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The light goes on,</v>

451
00:20:35.041 --> 00:20:36.930
<v Speaker 2>the handle illuminates let you know you</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

452
00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:38.520
<v Speaker 2>it opens for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get in,</v>

453
00:20:38.521 --> 00:20:42.350
<v Speaker 2>you just press start and go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy how often it works.</v>

454
00:20:42.351 --> 00:20:43.780
<v Speaker 2>We get never fucks up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

455
00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:45.660
<v Speaker 2>And that's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is cool.</v>

456
00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:50.660
<v Speaker 2>But it's just when you think about how</v>
<v Speaker 2>many different things fail in terms of</v>

457
00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:54.070
<v Speaker 2>electronics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know how many different people's</v>

458
00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:59.180
<v Speaker 2>iphones start fucking up most cars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when it comes to like your</v>

459
00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:02.470
<v Speaker 2>card,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a German engineering or Japanese</v>

460
00:21:02.471 --> 00:21:03.520
<v Speaker 2>engineering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

461
00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:06.480
<v Speaker 2>They're so fucking reliable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the,</v>

462
00:21:06.481 --> 00:21:10.540
<v Speaker 2>the amount of times that they actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>do fuck up is people complain about it</v>

463
00:21:10.541 --> 00:21:15.541
<v Speaker 2>but it's pretty small.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And while I was in school and I learned</v>

464
00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:21.010
<v Speaker 2>a study in [inaudible] 95 when it came</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the Lexus and the Honda,</v>

465
00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:23.580
<v Speaker 2>the car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're pretty much perfect [inaudible].</v>

466
00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:27.400
<v Speaker 2>So they had to add features.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now have you noticed where everything</v>

467
00:21:27.401 --> 00:21:30.880
<v Speaker 2>is about the features and less about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

468
00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:35.770
<v Speaker 2>and there's a cycle of cars having more</v>
<v Speaker 2>power and cost saving gas cars having</v>

469
00:21:35.850 --> 00:21:37.080
<v Speaker 2>power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just a pattern.</v>

470
00:21:37.081 --> 00:21:39.160
<v Speaker 2>It's just gonna happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

471
00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:41.260
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all about the features now.</v>

472
00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:43.630
<v Speaker 2>Even with phones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all about the features.</v>

473
00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:46.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well for sure.</v>

474
00:21:46.061 --> 00:21:49.480
<v Speaker 2>I mean with new cars tube is like you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to have apps and all sorts of</v>

475
00:21:49.481 --> 00:21:53.470
<v Speaker 2>different things that your car can do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But those older cars,</v>

476
00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:57.470
<v Speaker 2>the one of the interesting thing is how</v>
<v Speaker 2>long some of them lasts.</v>

477
00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:00.850
<v Speaker 2>Like I have a friend who has Alexa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it was a million miles on it.</v>

478
00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:06.280
<v Speaker 2>It's a million miles because the gs</v>
<v Speaker 2>$300,</v>

479
00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:11.290
<v Speaker 2>the fourth member.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But model it is the older,</v>

480
00:22:11.291 --> 00:22:12.700
<v Speaker 2>bigger ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The big one.</v>

481
00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:13.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

482
00:22:13.490 --> 00:22:17.260
<v Speaker 2>that's the one that's supposed to be an</v>
<v Speaker 2>asset car asset car.</v>

483
00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:17.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

484
00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:19.870
<v Speaker 2>it's gonna appreciate really because</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

485
00:22:19.871 --> 00:22:22.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the foreign cars are just now starting</v>

486
00:22:22.181 --> 00:22:24.310
<v Speaker 2>to appreciate versus the old American</v>
<v Speaker 2>cars.</v>

487
00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:27.040
<v Speaker 2>Well you mean foreign,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Japanese cars.</v>

488
00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:28.830
<v Speaker 2>German cars are always kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>appreciated,</v>

489
00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:29.910
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like porsches.</v>

490
00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:31.510
<v Speaker 2>But yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Porsche's and stuff like that,</v>

491
00:22:31.511 --> 00:22:33.410
<v Speaker 2>but as far as like the little light.</v>

492
00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:35.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Japanese cars and like the Lexus.</v>

493
00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:37.420
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what's really appreciating now</v>

494
00:22:37.421 --> 00:22:40.780
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of interesting is those old</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nissan skylines.</v>

495
00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:43.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The ones that became the gtrs.</v>

496
00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:47.470
<v Speaker 2>When you look at a gtr now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very different looking,</v>

497
00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:50.080
<v Speaker 2>very spaceship looking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the older ones are kind of like more</v>

498
00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:54.370
<v Speaker 2>retro and kind of cool looking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the oldest ones now are starting to</v>

499
00:22:54.371 --> 00:22:56.020
<v Speaker 2>become really valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

500
00:22:56.021 --> 00:22:58.300
<v Speaker 2>Like the early nineties and late</v>
<v Speaker 2>eighties.</v>

501
00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:00.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just hard to find one.</v>

502
00:23:00.131 --> 00:23:02.200
<v Speaker 2>It's not molested because a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people took,</v>

503
00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:04.780
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they did shit to the fenders and</v>

504
00:23:04.781 --> 00:23:06.640
<v Speaker 2>they fucked with this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He fucked with that.</v>

505
00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:10.300
<v Speaker 2>I just told her ticket about that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>other day we was talking about cars and</v>

506
00:23:10.301 --> 00:23:11.180
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

507
00:23:11.181 --> 00:23:13.180
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to find something that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>could find one.</v>

508
00:23:13.181 --> 00:23:15.130
<v Speaker 2>It's not been molested.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was like,</v>

509
00:23:15.131 --> 00:23:19.170
<v Speaker 2>what in the heck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Explain to her what molested was and</v>

510
00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:23.470
<v Speaker 2>what retard tranny is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Retard.</v>

511
00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:25.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For a car.</v>

512
00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:27.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't turn over.</v>

513
00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:30.940
<v Speaker 2>It's like when they don't move forward</v>
<v Speaker 2>with something is holding it back.</v>

514
00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:34.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you called it a retard retard,</v>

515
00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:39.040
<v Speaker 2>like have you tried to turn the car and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it won't turn over retarded.</v>

516
00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:44.460
<v Speaker 2>Slow like it won't turn and then mostly</v>
<v Speaker 2>using like the Europe,</v>

517
00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:45.890
<v Speaker 2>Europeans use it</v>

518
00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:49.040
<v Speaker 1>most of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do they really use it like a standard</v>

519
00:23:49.041 --> 00:23:49.870
<v Speaker 1>term?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

520
00:23:49.870 --> 00:23:51.980
<v Speaker 1>like some of the blogs and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

521
00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:54.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>

522
00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:56.300
<v Speaker 1>Do you read blogs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm cars.</v>

523
00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:57.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when I,</v>

524
00:23:57.530 --> 00:24:00.680
<v Speaker 1>because I work on my car myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

525
00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:04.130
<v Speaker 1>anytime you are trying to diagnose a</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>

526
00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:08.210
<v Speaker 1>it's more reading then going actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>going out to figure out what it is.</v>

527
00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:10.670
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You read all that kind of stuff but you</v>

528
00:24:10.671 --> 00:24:15.380
<v Speaker 1>don't read up about like suspensions or</v>
<v Speaker 1>different tire offsets or anything like</v>

529
00:24:15.381 --> 00:24:17.300
<v Speaker 1>that or no?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How come?</v>

530
00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:18.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think uh,</v>

531
00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:22.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really never really have what they</v>

532
00:24:22.491 --> 00:24:25.010
<v Speaker 1>call a super car up or modified it too</v>
<v Speaker 1>much,</v>

533
00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:28.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so everything I get,</v>

534
00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:31.850
<v Speaker 1>I used to just ride basically with it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I can have fun with that because I'm</v>

535
00:24:31.851 --> 00:24:33.410
<v Speaker 1>not a high horsepower guy.</v>

536
00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:38.830
<v Speaker 1>I just need it to be quick and like turn</v>
<v Speaker 1>and handled well and I just live</v>

537
00:24:38.841 --> 00:24:41.510
<v Speaker 1>dangerously within that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

538
00:24:42.050 --> 00:24:45.710
<v Speaker 1>you live dangerously</v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

539
00:24:46.650 --> 00:24:47.710
<v Speaker 1>Those cars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

540
00:24:47.711 --> 00:24:49.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a BMW three series.</v>

541
00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:50.900
<v Speaker 1>Like those cars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're handled.</v>

542
00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:53.420
<v Speaker 1>They handled great anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like my friend Eddie bought one of those</v>

543
00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:58.660
<v Speaker 1>a few years back and he had before that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like an old shitty bronco and when he</v>

544
00:24:58.941 --> 00:25:02.060
<v Speaker 1>got that a bmw three series,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>

545
00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:03.500
<v Speaker 1>oh my God man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

546

<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

547
00:25:05.421 --> 00:25:07.210
<v Speaker 1>I never knew that driving was actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>fun.</v>

548
00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:08.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I would go,</v>

549
00:25:08.391 --> 00:25:09.710
<v Speaker 1>he would go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a,</v>

550
00:25:09.711 --> 00:25:13.910
<v Speaker 1>I would take Mulholland just for fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like just decided I'm gonna take it this</v>

551
00:25:13.911 --> 00:25:16.880
<v Speaker 1>way if no longer just because I'm bored,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

552
00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:19.610
<v Speaker 1>I took,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in Topanga like last month with</v>

553
00:25:19.611 --> 00:25:22.270
<v Speaker 1>the car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The road is a road as a ward now.</v>

554
00:25:23.570 --> 00:25:28.310
<v Speaker 1>Pure warped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My role is a warped from what?</v>

555
00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:31.940
<v Speaker 1>From just breaking and like his driving</v>
<v Speaker 1>Topanga.</v>

556
00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:35.030
<v Speaker 1>Topanga.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many times did you do it that day?</v>

557
00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:39.470
<v Speaker 1>I was filming something like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>documentary and I went hard that day,</v>

558
00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:42.590
<v Speaker 1>but it was already working for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went that day.</v>

559
00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:44.450
<v Speaker 1>You were filming a documentary in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>car?</v>

560
00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:46.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing?</v>

561
00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:49.820
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody was doing a documentary on</v>

562
00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:54.850
<v Speaker 1>creating comedians create content and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was showing them like what,</v>

563
00:25:55.071 --> 00:25:57.200
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how I get inspired and what gets me in</v>

564
00:25:57.201 --> 00:25:59.960
<v Speaker 1>the mood and the car is one of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

565
00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:01.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because when you talk about,</v>

566
00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:05.010
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about engineering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so kind of you know,</v>

567
00:26:05.011 --> 00:26:07.560
<v Speaker 1>and putting it in comedy set.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

568
00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:12.500
<v Speaker 1>And I'm just a balance between</v>
<v Speaker 1>the left and right brain,</v>

569
00:26:12.501 --> 00:26:17.300
<v Speaker 1>the logic side and the creative side and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the balance between the two because my</v>

570
00:26:17.301 --> 00:26:20.420
<v Speaker 1>style is basically that balance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

571
00:26:22.090 --> 00:26:22.923
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know.</v>

572

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

573
00:26:23.890 --> 00:26:27.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you get this by driving,</v>

574
00:26:27.261 --> 00:26:28.190
<v Speaker 1>is that what you're saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

575
00:26:28.191 --> 00:26:30.140
<v Speaker 1>I've been driving is something that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's beautiful.</v>

576
00:26:30.141 --> 00:26:35.141
<v Speaker 1>I took him to a junk yard also cause the</v>
<v Speaker 1>death of a car and the rebirth of parts</v>

577
00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:36.640
<v Speaker 1>when you need it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

578
00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:38.720
<v Speaker 1>the life and death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Yang Yang of that.</v>

579
00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:41.930
<v Speaker 1>And I took him to paint a cane because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>did la,</v>

580
00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:45.870
<v Speaker 1>I did acid in Topanga.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a good place to.</v>

581
00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:46.561
<v Speaker 1>Acid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

582
00:26:46.561 --> 00:26:48.420
<v Speaker 1>So at one part we kind of an original</v>
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>

583
00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:51.570
<v Speaker 1>a lot of acid going onto panga.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you,</v>

584
00:26:51.571 --> 00:26:53.340
<v Speaker 1>when you out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got nature right?</v>

585
00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:56.360
<v Speaker 1>And then when you turned onto the</v>
<v Speaker 1>street,</v>

586
00:26:56.570 --> 00:26:59.040
<v Speaker 1>you have all these sports cars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

587
00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:02.270
<v Speaker 1>which is beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got a manmade creation.</v>

588
00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:07.870
<v Speaker 1>They also has life to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you looking at just trying to follow</v>

589
00:27:10.531 --> 00:27:11.460
<v Speaker 1>you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

590
00:27:11.790 --> 00:27:14.640
<v Speaker 1>I get what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we found and I took traction control</v>

591
00:27:14.641 --> 00:27:19.020
<v Speaker 1>off and it was four of us in that little</v>
<v Speaker 1>car and we just slid around a corner a</v>

592
00:27:19.021 --> 00:27:22.410
<v Speaker 1>corner and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those guys were scared,</v>

593
00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:24.640
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

594
00:27:24.641 --> 00:27:25.930
<v Speaker 1>You're sliding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

595
00:27:25.931 --> 00:27:28.240
<v Speaker 1>it was a residential street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They should be kind of nervous.</v>

596
00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:30.040
<v Speaker 1>It was a little nervous and I was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little nervous,</v>

597
00:27:30.041 --> 00:27:31.470
<v Speaker 1>but that will made it fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

598
00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:34.630
<v Speaker 1>we did that together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has tricky though because that's kind</v>

599
00:27:34.631 --> 00:27:36.790
<v Speaker 1>of a lot of people drive into Topanga.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

600
00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:40.360
<v Speaker 1>And that's what adds to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the edginess of it,</v>

601
00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:42.070
<v Speaker 1>just like my set,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

602
00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:47.540
<v Speaker 1>is that line you can call that edginess</v>
<v Speaker 1>or irresponsible on public roads,</v>

603
00:27:47.541 --> 00:27:48.730
<v Speaker 1>you could call it that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

604
00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:49.750
<v Speaker 1>What I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

605
00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:52.400
<v Speaker 1>once you get into that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like trying to figure out the</v>

606
00:27:52.401 --> 00:27:54.290
<v Speaker 1>offset of attire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

607
00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:56.780
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those little details,</v>

608
00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:59.420
<v Speaker 1>little details of what's fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous.</v>

609
00:28:00.730 --> 00:28:03.020
<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not a little detail when you</v>

610
00:28:03.021 --> 00:28:06.410
<v Speaker 1>slide in sideways on a residential road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

611
00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:09.110
<v Speaker 1>One thing that's a little detail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

612
00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:09.860
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

613
00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:12.350
<v Speaker 1>that could be the difference between,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

614
00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:17.740
<v Speaker 1>a man that was close in like somebody to</v>
<v Speaker 1>call nine one one,</v>

615
00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:20.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

616
00:28:20.181 --> 00:28:21.400
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's irresponsible,</v>

617
00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:22.243
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it?</v>

618
00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:23.930
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fine.</v>

619
00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:27.830
<v Speaker 1>No worries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just edgy to scuttle sliding around.</v>

620
00:28:27.831 --> 00:28:29.810
<v Speaker 1>Losing control of your car on public</v>
<v Speaker 1>roads.</v>

621
00:28:29.811 --> 00:28:31.850
<v Speaker 1>No big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like when you,</v>

622
00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:34.070
<v Speaker 1>we will be at high school at parties and</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

623
00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:35.300
<v Speaker 1>a gun would come out.</v>

624
00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:37.610
<v Speaker 1>Oh Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you thought the Party was fine.</v>

625
00:28:37.611 --> 00:28:41.570
<v Speaker 1>But when that pistol came out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when real excitement happens</v>

626
00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:46.160
<v Speaker 1>in school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dudes are pulling guns out in your</v>

627
00:28:46.161 --> 00:28:47.240
<v Speaker 1>parties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

628
00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:49.870
<v Speaker 1>right apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A party wasn't good and lets the cops</v>

629
00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:52.250
<v Speaker 1>showed up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

630
00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:54.110
<v Speaker 1>So you have the cops didn't show it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>

631
00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:56.270
<v Speaker 1>And so when guns were getting pulled</v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

632
00:28:56.271 --> 00:28:58.210
<v Speaker 1>what were they getting pulled out for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

633
00:28:58.250 --> 00:29:00.050
<v Speaker 1>people probably was arguing about</v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

634
00:29:00.130 --> 00:29:01.490
<v Speaker 1>Some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many times did you see this?</v>

635
00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:04.880
<v Speaker 1>A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not a lot of times this will happen.</v>

636
00:29:05.170 --> 00:29:07.040
<v Speaker 1>It just what happened regularly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

637
00:29:07.570 --> 00:29:09.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the night clothes and you started</v>

638
00:29:09.021 --> 00:29:10.620
<v Speaker 1>going to nightclubs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

639
00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:12.940
<v Speaker 1>These things will happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

640
00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:14.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think about all this shit</v>

641
00:29:14.391 --> 00:29:16.640
<v Speaker 1>lately?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That it seems like every couple of days</v>

642
00:29:16.641 --> 00:29:18.360
<v Speaker 1>there's some sort of a mass shooting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

643
00:29:18.370 --> 00:29:18.760
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

644
00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:22.660
<v Speaker 1>the problem with being a black guy from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

645
00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:25.730
<v Speaker 1>those areas in your thirties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just what happens,</v>

646
00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:27.073
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

647
00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:28.700
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

648
00:29:29.150 --> 00:29:32.660
<v Speaker 1>but in your twenties at any man really</v>
<v Speaker 1>took me in the twenties is more fight.</v>

649
00:29:32.661 --> 00:29:34.790
<v Speaker 1>It's like that military,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we're not going to take this,</v>

650
00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:37.610
<v Speaker 1>Yada Yada Yada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

651
00:29:38.570 --> 00:29:41.920
<v Speaker 1>and I could imagine like I'd be imagined</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes I look at it a funny way like</v>

652
00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:43.001
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my grandmother,</v>

653
00:29:43.001 --> 00:29:45.460
<v Speaker 1>this is nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

654
00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:50.080
<v Speaker 1>Because they were like hanging people</v>
<v Speaker 1>and throw them over the bridge and the</v>

655
00:29:50.081 --> 00:29:54.280
<v Speaker 1>county where she's from and shoot them</v>
<v Speaker 1>shot guns for fun.</v>

656
00:29:54.281 --> 00:29:55.870
<v Speaker 1>So this is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

657
00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:59.470
<v Speaker 1>to me in her mind she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh they need an excuse now</v>

658
00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:02.680
<v Speaker 1>who is doing this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean?</v>

659
00:30:02.681 --> 00:30:05.190
<v Speaker 1>Like they were throwing people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hanging over bridges,</v>

660
00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:06.640
<v Speaker 1>shooting them for fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

661
00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:09.370
<v Speaker 1>because I'm from the south,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so things are a little,</v>

662
00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:13.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>little old school sometimes it's not</v>

663
00:30:13.061 --> 00:30:14.500
<v Speaker 1>that long ago when certain things</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen,</v>

664
00:30:14.530 --> 00:30:17.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Jim Crow and like these things</v>

665
00:30:17.681 --> 00:30:20.800
<v Speaker 1>aren't that old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you still hear the stories.</v>

666
00:30:22.090 --> 00:30:22.710
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

667
00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:25.810
<v Speaker 1>you're brought up a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

668
00:30:25.850 --> 00:30:28.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say racist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you brought up to like these people</v>

669
00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:33.190
<v Speaker 1>are their enemy or be careful when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're on that side of town or like they</v>

670
00:30:33.191 --> 00:30:36.070
<v Speaker 1>say you might not come back home when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you leave the house.</v>

671
00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:40.000
<v Speaker 1>So when you're talking about is white</v>
<v Speaker 1>people doing fucked up shit to black</v>

672
00:30:40.001 --> 00:30:43.690
<v Speaker 1>people like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was something that was so common</v>

673
00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:45.430
<v Speaker 1>that it was just talked about all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

674
00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:46.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

675
00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:48.490
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you still have nice people,</v>

676
00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:49.380
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

677
00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:53.670
<v Speaker 1>it's an honesty in it that I don't see</v>
<v Speaker 1>anywhere else because when I got out</v>

678
00:30:53.690 --> 00:30:58.690
<v Speaker 1>here people act like racism didn't exist</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it affected comedy like three years</v>

679
00:30:59.291 --> 00:31:00.550
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

680
00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:03.260
<v Speaker 1>who the fuck was acting like racism</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't exist.</v>

681
00:31:03.261 --> 00:31:03.941
<v Speaker 1>What would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

682
00:31:03.941 --> 00:31:06.700
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on and it's not that bad at or who</v>

683
00:31:06.701 --> 00:31:07.534
<v Speaker 1>was in that?</v>

684
00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:11.810
<v Speaker 1>People would say that it's not that bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we don't.</v>

685
00:31:12.150 --> 00:31:15.060
<v Speaker 1>When people love to say there's no</v>
<v Speaker 1>racism because Obama's black.</v>

686
00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:17.290
<v Speaker 1>Hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of my favorite ones.</v>

687
00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:18.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like people.</v>

688
00:31:18.191 --> 00:31:22.100
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I'm still shellshocked but my</v>

689
00:31:22.101 --> 00:31:26.680
<v Speaker 1>situation is different because I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>treated unfair within my own community.</v>

690
00:31:26.681 --> 00:31:30.290
<v Speaker 1>Then I left my community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

691
00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:33.070
<v Speaker 1>like I had the whole light skin dark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My sister,</v>

692
00:31:33.071 --> 00:31:34.300
<v Speaker 1>light skinned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fair skinned.</v>

693
00:31:34.301 --> 00:31:36.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm dark skin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

694
00:31:36.370 --> 00:31:40.030
<v Speaker 1>So you were treated poorly within your</v>
<v Speaker 1>own kid because your skins too dark</v>

695
00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:44.890
<v Speaker 1>because of that one thing and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>single mother being looked upon</v>

696
00:31:44.891 --> 00:31:49.690
<v Speaker 1>differently and we are in the Bible belt</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's a lot of like not having nice</v>

697
00:31:49.691 --> 00:31:54.691
<v Speaker 1>clothes and bullying Brian and then I</v>
<v Speaker 1>got sent to a white school when I was</v>

698
00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:57.220
<v Speaker 1>bad at my first year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

699
00:31:57.730 --> 00:32:00.730
<v Speaker 1>So to me it was like this whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this whole world is crazy,</v>

700
00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:03.370
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

701
00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:05.610
<v Speaker 1>That's the weird thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it,</v>

702
00:32:05.611 --> 00:32:10.180
<v Speaker 1>that the racism inside the black</v>
<v Speaker 1>community between light skinned and dark</v>

703
00:32:10.210 --> 00:32:13.630
<v Speaker 1>skinned people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it isn't until you go to Brazil and</v>

704
00:32:13.631 --> 00:32:15.620
<v Speaker 1>you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

705
00:32:16.210 --> 00:32:20.290
<v Speaker 1>where they all Brazilian and see the</v>
<v Speaker 1>racism Brazilians or you know,</v>

706
00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:24.490
<v Speaker 1>you started hanging out with other</v>
<v Speaker 1>cultures and start seeing the</v>

707
00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:30.250
<v Speaker 1>separation with the other coaches in</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying that what I call a pattern of</v>

708
00:32:30.550 --> 00:32:33.520
<v Speaker 1>human behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well there's definitely a pattern and</v>

709
00:32:33.521 --> 00:32:37.230
<v Speaker 1>human behavior and trying to find groups</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they belong to and then an</v>

710
00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:39.920
<v Speaker 1>alienating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isolating themselves from the other</v>

711
00:32:39.921 --> 00:32:40.754
<v Speaker 1>groups.</v>

712
00:32:41.030 --> 00:32:41.863
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>

713
00:32:42.030 --> 00:32:44.850
<v Speaker 2>that's an unfortunate thing that people</v>
<v Speaker 2>do and they do it.</v>

714
00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:47.330
<v Speaker 2>The feminist thing to me to separate man</v>
<v Speaker 2>from woman.</v>

715
00:32:48.890 --> 00:32:49.723
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

716
00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:52.580
<v Speaker 2>and then you got the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

717
00:32:52.790 --> 00:32:57.530
<v Speaker 2>the gays and then you got what's going</v>
<v Speaker 2>on in between the black people in the</v>

718
00:32:57.531 --> 00:33:00.110
<v Speaker 2>cops know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we just two groups that are</v>

719
00:33:00.111 --> 00:33:03.830
<v Speaker 2>opposing each other more so now than</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>

720
00:33:04.550 --> 00:33:07.190
<v Speaker 2>So you think feminism is separating men</v>
<v Speaker 2>from women?</v>

721
00:33:07.191 --> 00:33:08.490
<v Speaker 2>That's what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a,</v>

722
00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:11.360
<v Speaker 2>it's a slight shifting of,</v>

723
00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:13.280
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

724
00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:15.020
<v Speaker 2>especially with the guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

725
00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:16.190
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>male feminists,</v>

726
00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:19.370
<v Speaker 2>male feminists and male feminists or</v>
<v Speaker 2>barely real.</v>

727
00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:21.140
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird situation.</v>

728
00:33:21.170 --> 00:33:22.670
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just parked his joint.</v>

729
00:33:22.671 --> 00:33:24.080
<v Speaker 2>Keep up with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Male,</v>

730
00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:25.340
<v Speaker 2>male feminists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So seriously,</v>

731
00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:27.380
<v Speaker 2>barely real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're barely real.</v>

732
00:33:27.410 --> 00:33:31.610
<v Speaker 2>There's a very tiny percentage of men</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are actually male feminists.</v>

733
00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:37.060
<v Speaker 2>The smallest percentage are actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>adhere to those ideologies.</v>

734
00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:41.570
<v Speaker 2>The vast majority are doing what's</v>
<v Speaker 2>called virtue signaling.</v>

735
00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:43.670
<v Speaker 2>Michael Shermer has got the best</v>
<v Speaker 2>expression.</v>

736
00:33:43.671 --> 00:33:45.380
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if that's his expression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see it everywhere.</v>

737
00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:48.380
<v Speaker 2>I see it more often now than ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>

738
00:33:48.381 --> 00:33:51.290
<v Speaker 2>I think since he's been on this podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

739
00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:53.480
<v Speaker 2>what they're doing is just trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>make everybody think that they're</v>

740
00:33:53.481 --> 00:33:54.810
<v Speaker 2>amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're there,</v>

741
00:33:54.811 --> 00:33:59.811
<v Speaker 2>so virtuous there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so ethical and so moral and so open</v>

742
00:33:59.931 --> 00:34:03.380
<v Speaker 2>minded and fair and they're thinking</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they've,</v>

743
00:34:03.790 --> 00:34:05.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they identify as a feminist,</v>

744
00:34:05.690 --> 00:34:07.820
<v Speaker 2>but most of it is guys that just can't</v>
<v Speaker 2>get any pussy.</v>

745
00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:09.170
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought I was the truth.</v>

746
00:34:09.290 --> 00:34:12.590
<v Speaker 2>I thought I was a true feminist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was talking to this young lady</v>

747
00:34:12.591 --> 00:34:14.840
<v Speaker 2>about how beautiful women are and I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

748
00:34:14.841 --> 00:34:17.210
<v Speaker 2>they like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like to be in place with beautiful</v>

749
00:34:17.211 --> 00:34:20.560
<v Speaker 2>women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They like cars once good,</v>

750
00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:23.750
<v Speaker 2>you sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she was like,</v>

751
00:34:23.751 --> 00:34:25.610
<v Speaker 2>you objectify women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

752
00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:27.230
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess I take the five women then,</v>

753
00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:30.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see that thing Jamie and a thing I</v>

754
00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:35.620
<v Speaker 2>tweeted the other day from Cosmo</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cosmopolitan magazine side-by-side</v>

755
00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:38.930
<v Speaker 2>cover.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a retweet from the amazing</v>

756
00:34:38.931 --> 00:34:39.764
<v Speaker 2>atheist.</v>

757
00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:46.540
<v Speaker 2>We'd a side by side cover.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of them was white men who objectify</v>

758
00:34:46.701 --> 00:34:49.340
<v Speaker 2>women are the effing worst.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

759
00:34:49.370 --> 00:34:54.370
<v Speaker 2>and the very next cover it showed CV.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's identifying men's bulges during the</v>

760
00:34:56.991 --> 00:34:58.340
<v Speaker 2>Olympics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

761
00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:00.800
<v Speaker 2>It's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's hypocrites.</v>

762
00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:04.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I always had confirmed,</v>

763
00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:09.560
<v Speaker 2>confirmed men who objectify women are</v>
<v Speaker 2>effing horrible.</v>

764
00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:14.980
<v Speaker 2>Thirty six summer Olympic bulges that</v>
<v Speaker 2>deserve gold and then it's just guys abs</v>

765
00:35:15.111 --> 00:35:16.270
<v Speaker 2>with their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

766
00:35:16.730 --> 00:35:18.290
<v Speaker 2>speedos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at their cocks.</v>

767
00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:20.180
<v Speaker 2>It's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are fucking hilarious.</v>

768
00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:22.100
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I feel like,</v>

769
00:35:22.370 --> 00:35:25.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I talk I try to be as truthful as</v>

770
00:35:25.101 --> 00:35:27.500
<v Speaker 2>possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I only learned through my ignorance.</v>

771
00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:30.440
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You only learn.</v>

772
00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:32.630
<v Speaker 2>Well I learned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we learned through my ignorance,</v>

773
00:35:32.631 --> 00:35:35.450
<v Speaker 2>but you learned a lot from shit that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't know I'm messing up.</v>

774
00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:36.313
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

775
00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:37.980
<v Speaker 2>Or Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or not knowing.</v>

776
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:40.370
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I think there's a,</v>

777
00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:44.460
<v Speaker 4>I think feminism and all these things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is like a giant scale,</v>

778
00:35:44.490 --> 00:35:45.820
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then there's,</v>

779
00:35:45.850 --> 00:35:48.240
<v Speaker 4>there's feminism that totally makes</v>
<v Speaker 4>sense to me.</v>

780
00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:52.080
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a lot of women that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

781
00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:56.790
<v Speaker 4>they did get treated unfairly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They work with assholes who just want to</v>

782
00:35:56.791 --> 00:36:01.080
<v Speaker 4>fuck them or want to treat him like shit</v>
<v Speaker 4>because they're a woman or they have</v>

783
00:36:01.081 --> 00:36:04.680
<v Speaker 4>power over them and they know they can</v>
<v Speaker 4>pull some stuff on them that they can't</v>

784
00:36:04.681 --> 00:36:08.940
<v Speaker 4>pull on men.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's 100 percent real and I</v>

785
00:36:08.941 --> 00:36:11.070
<v Speaker 4>think there's a lot of women that are</v>
<v Speaker 4>awesome.</v>

786
00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:11.761
<v Speaker 4>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>

787
00:36:11.761 --> 00:36:13.170
<v Speaker 4>they're cool,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're creative,</v>

788
00:36:13.171 --> 00:36:16.990
<v Speaker 4>they're funny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're powerful and you know,</v>

789
00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:20.640
<v Speaker 4>to call it feminism or whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're just awesome humans.</v>

790
00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:23.190
<v Speaker 4>It happened to be women,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

791
00:36:23.191 --> 00:36:27.900
<v Speaker 4>so I think like the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in some ways the idea of feminism is to</v>

792
00:36:27.901 --> 00:36:32.901
<v Speaker 4>recognize those women for what they are</v>
<v Speaker 4>just awesome human beings and to sort of</v>

793
00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:37.260
<v Speaker 4>shield them and protect them against a</v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of sexism,</v>

794
00:36:37.261 --> 00:36:40.260
<v Speaker 4>a lot of misogyny and a lot of shit that</v>
<v Speaker 4>gets directed and their direction.</v>

795
00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:41.910
<v Speaker 4>And I know it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen it.</v>

796
00:36:41.911 --> 00:36:43.320
<v Speaker 4>It's 100 percent real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

797
00:36:43.321 --> 00:36:44.970
<v Speaker 4>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a lot of sexism,</v>

798
00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:49.500
<v Speaker 4>just like anybody that would say to you</v>
<v Speaker 4>that there's no racism that is fucking</v>

799
00:36:49.590 --> 00:36:51.960
<v Speaker 4>papaschase.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course there's racism is racism</v>

800
00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:54.540
<v Speaker 4>amongst black people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>against other black people.</v>

801
00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:55.530
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I experienced that.</v>

802
00:36:55.770 --> 00:36:57.720
<v Speaker 4>This,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's just ignorance,</v>

803
00:36:57.721 --> 00:37:01.680
<v Speaker 4>just foolish people and I think in a lot</v>
<v Speaker 4>of ways it's not even the people's</v>

804
00:37:01.681 --> 00:37:05.580
<v Speaker 4>fault.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of what we are is a measurement of</v>

805
00:37:05.610 --> 00:37:08.580
<v Speaker 4>who our parents were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who their parents were,</v>

806
00:37:08.610 --> 00:37:12.450
<v Speaker 4>the neighborhoods that we lived in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the people that were exposed to and the</v>

807
00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:16.230
<v Speaker 4>think process,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the thought process that surrounds these</v>

808
00:37:16.231 --> 00:37:18.870
<v Speaker 4>areas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's super difficult to escape.</v>

809
00:37:19.530 --> 00:37:21.150
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just really hard for people to</v>

810
00:37:21.151 --> 00:37:25.290
<v Speaker 4>think outside of the box.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's easier now because you might live</v>

811
00:37:25.291 --> 00:37:29.280
<v Speaker 4>in a bad neighborhood with a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 4>silly people that don't think very well,</v>

812
00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:33.530
<v Speaker 4>but you have access to the Internet now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So now you can start to take it into</v>

813
00:37:33.531 --> 00:37:35.460
<v Speaker 4>their ideas and consider those ideas and</v>
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>

814
00:37:35.461 --> 00:37:37.020
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe these fucking people around me are</v>

815
00:37:37.021 --> 00:37:37.550
<v Speaker 4>asshole.</v>

816
00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:39.530
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem with the Internet is,</v>

817
00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:45.290
<v Speaker 1>and I got friends and family that don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have the thought of going to the</v>

818
00:37:45.291 --> 00:37:47.030
<v Speaker 1>Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

819
00:37:47.690 --> 00:37:49.850
<v Speaker 1>that's the problem with the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the Internet.</v>

820
00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:53.600
<v Speaker 1>But when you know that situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

821
00:37:53.601 --> 00:37:55.370
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

822
00:37:56.090 --> 00:37:58.430
<v Speaker 1>So if I have a conversation with</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody and I was like,</v>

823
00:37:58.431 --> 00:37:59.980
<v Speaker 1>why don't you just google it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they was like,</v>

824
00:37:59.981 --> 00:38:01.940
<v Speaker 1>what I'm asking you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

825
00:38:01.941 --> 00:38:03.590
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're hanging around with Chili people.</v>

826
00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:06.380
<v Speaker 1>Well this is just real people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm related to,</v>

827
00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:07.303
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

828
00:38:07.310 --> 00:38:08.950
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing you can do about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

829
00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:11.060
<v Speaker 1>but it's like you got to leave them</v>
<v Speaker 1>behind.</v>

830
00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:12.620
<v Speaker 1>It's tough though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's tough.</v>

831
00:38:12.650 --> 00:38:13.550
<v Speaker 1>It's tough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

832
00:38:13.590 --> 00:38:14.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have left,</v>

833
00:38:14.570 --> 00:38:17.370
<v Speaker 1>but I realized once I left home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the smarter,</v>

834
00:38:17.371 --> 00:38:21.650
<v Speaker 1>the only person that's educated or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>person who thought outside the box is</v>

835
00:38:21.651 --> 00:38:24.350
<v Speaker 1>gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were the only person that was</v>

836
00:38:24.351 --> 00:38:25.820
<v Speaker 1>thinking outside the box for the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>part.</v>

837
00:38:25.830 --> 00:38:26.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

838
00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:27.500
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

839
00:38:27.501 --> 00:38:30.980
<v Speaker 4>what do they think about you being like</v>
<v Speaker 4>this sort of subversive comedian?</v>

840
00:38:31.070 --> 00:38:33.170
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're this like minded,</v>

841
00:38:33.171 --> 00:38:36.850
<v Speaker 4>free speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It says wild shit onstage.</v>

842
00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:38.300
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't get it.</v>

843
00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:39.850
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the funding.</v>

844
00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:41.293
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

845
00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:45.940
<v Speaker 1>to be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm here to tell them they're wrong.</v>

846
00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:46.893
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't.</v>

847
00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:50.380
<v Speaker 1>You can just tell by the look in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>face when they see it.</v>

848
00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:52.540
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't that what they,</v>

849
00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:55.750
<v Speaker 1>it's not worldstar hip hop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what they're expecting?</v>

850
00:38:56.020 --> 00:38:57.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what they found.</v>

851
00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:58.870
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at this dude gets slapped,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

853
00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:02.500
<v Speaker 1>So it's just a different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

854
00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:04.450
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've socially,</v>

855
00:39:04.451 --> 00:39:08.860
<v Speaker 1>economically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mentally crossed over,</v>

856
00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:13.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it happened so long ago that you</v>

857
00:39:13.181 --> 00:39:15.280
<v Speaker 1>felt like you can't relate sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're talking to them.</v>

858
00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:18.700
<v Speaker 1>Well in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the thing,</v>

859
00:39:18.701 --> 00:39:20.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's things you find interesting,</v>

860
00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:23.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they might not find interesting and it's</v>

861
00:39:23.591 --> 00:39:25.720
<v Speaker 1>always a thing in the black community</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they was like,</v>

862
00:39:26.290 --> 00:39:29.980
<v Speaker 1>how a desegregation in the black</v>
<v Speaker 1>community because it took the doctors</v>

863
00:39:29.981 --> 00:39:33.530
<v Speaker 1>and lawyers out of the community but</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't think,</v>

864
00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:36.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to hang around them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Niggas ain't trying to sit around</v>

865
00:39:36.761 --> 00:39:38.650
<v Speaker 1>motherfuckers that drink alcohol all</v>
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>

866
00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:41.380
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they tend to talk about how to</v>

867
00:39:41.381 --> 00:39:45.310
<v Speaker 1>invest in what percentage the bank</v>
<v Speaker 1>returns versus,</v>

868
00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:46.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

869
00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:47.453
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

870
00:39:47.490 --> 00:39:50.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ira or something like that was like,</v>

871
00:39:50.590 --> 00:39:52.700
<v Speaker 1>he tried to like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I see.</v>

872
00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:56.500
<v Speaker 1>I understand why these things happen</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

873
00:39:56.590 --> 00:39:58.040
<v Speaker 1>Why people move out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

874
00:39:58.080 --> 00:39:59.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

875
00:39:59.190 --> 00:40:01.930
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's the journey that I'm on.</v>

876
00:40:01.931 --> 00:40:04.480
<v Speaker 1>And then I try to go back and his</v>
<v Speaker 1>spleen,</v>

877
00:40:04.481 --> 00:40:05.530
<v Speaker 1>those things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

878
00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:11.210
<v Speaker 4>there's amazing aspects to all sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 4>different ethnicities,</v>

879
00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:14.210
<v Speaker 4>different parts of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>different groups of humans.</v>

880
00:40:14.211 --> 00:40:18.410
<v Speaker 4>There's like amazing aspects of their</v>
<v Speaker 4>culture that they,</v>

881
00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:21.830
<v Speaker 4>they have that it's gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's gonna be weird if all that stuff</v>

882
00:40:21.831 --> 00:40:26.831
<v Speaker 4>gets lost.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I think ultimately what human beings</v>

883
00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:32.240
<v Speaker 4>eventually you're going to have to</v>
<v Speaker 4>figure out is the only things that</v>

884
00:40:32.241 --> 00:40:36.530
<v Speaker 4>matter or like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's really like basically</v>

885
00:40:36.531 --> 00:40:39.350
<v Speaker 4>straight Martin Luther King Jr.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

886
00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:43.580
<v Speaker 4>judge a man by the content of his</v>
<v Speaker 4>character or a woman who are you.</v>

887
00:40:44.210 --> 00:40:48.680
<v Speaker 4>But we can identifY each other so easily</v>
<v Speaker 4>by what we look like or where we're</v>

888
00:40:48.681 --> 00:40:50.240
<v Speaker 4>from.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so easy.</v>

889
00:40:50.241 --> 00:40:52.280
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so many people are like so proud of</v>

890
00:40:52.281 --> 00:40:56.030
<v Speaker 4>being from a certain part of the world</v>
<v Speaker 4>and in some place I think in some ways I</v>

891
00:40:56.031 --> 00:40:59.660
<v Speaker 4>think it's kinda cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like armenians talk some shit about</v>

892
00:40:59.661 --> 00:41:04.190
<v Speaker 4>Armenia and armenians.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They'll smack the fuck outta of play,</v>

<v Speaker 4>don't even live there anymore.</v>

895
00:41:07.791 --> 00:41:10.070
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's like being someone who's really</v>

<v Speaker 4>into being american and living in south</v>

<v Speaker 4>saying someone's african,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like you don't fucking big africa</v>

928
00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:36.980
<v Speaker 4>is so many different countries in it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was a,</v>

929
00:42:37.310 --> 00:42:40.760
<v Speaker 4>I think it was umeboshi.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was watching some documentary about</v>

930
00:42:40.830 --> 00:42:44.080
<v Speaker 4>Namibia last night.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a mirrored bia.</v>

931
00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:44.983
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe not.</v>

932
00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:46.970
<v Speaker 4>Maybe Namibia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Namibia.</v>

933
00:42:47.570 --> 00:42:49.340
<v Speaker 4>Extremely under-populated.</v>

934
00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:53.690
<v Speaker 4>It's enormous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like bigger than Texas by like one</v>

935
00:42:53.691 --> 00:42:56.380
<v Speaker 4>quarter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is Texas fucking huge.</v>

936
00:42:56.840 --> 00:43:01.130
<v Speaker 4>So this country is bigger than Texas by</v>
<v Speaker 4>more than one quarter and I think it</v>

937
00:43:01.131 --> 00:43:04.070
<v Speaker 4>only has like 2 million people in it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

938
00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:06.080
<v Speaker 4>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were showing the little,</v>

939
00:43:06.110 --> 00:43:09.350
<v Speaker 4>this one village that they visited,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how little rain father was.</v>

940
00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:12.830
<v Speaker 4>They had one inch of rain in three</v>
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>

941
00:43:13.630 --> 00:43:15.290
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

942
00:43:15.291 --> 00:43:17.030
<v Speaker 4>When you look into how these people</v>
<v Speaker 4>live,</v>

943
00:43:17.031 --> 00:43:22.031
<v Speaker 4>like I like watching documentaries that</v>
<v Speaker 4>highlight human beings that just easily</v>

944
00:43:23.151 --> 00:43:26.390
<v Speaker 4>could be you or me easily if just this</v>
<v Speaker 4>happened.</v>

945
00:43:26.391 --> 00:43:28.880
<v Speaker 4>And that happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And her mother gave birth in this weird</v>

946
00:43:28.881 --> 00:43:30.770
<v Speaker 4>part of the world and they're just</v>
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

<v Speaker 4>They're waving to everybody.</v>

949
00:43:34.491 --> 00:43:36.110
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're waving to the camera.</v>

950
00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:39.680
<v Speaker 4>They're so excited that the camera</v>
<v Speaker 4>people are there to film this and</v>

951
00:43:39.681 --> 00:43:42.680
<v Speaker 4>they're out there cooking and it's so</v>
<v Speaker 4>dry,</v>

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 4>where are they getting their water?</v>

954
00:43:47.450 --> 00:43:49.190
<v Speaker 4>Where's the fucking water?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no water.</v>

955
00:43:49.250 --> 00:43:53.090
<v Speaker 4>This is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They had a on this documentary,</v>

<v Speaker 4>professional hunter.</v>

959
00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:05.580
<v Speaker 4>And he visits these communities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of times he's helping people.</v>

<v Speaker 4>He had to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they had to take out some crocodiles</v>

<v Speaker 4>people or customers accustomed to eating</v>

962
00:44:13.251 --> 00:44:14.480
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this one,</v>

00:44:14.481 --> 00:44:18.900
<v Speaker 4>they had to stop a hyena that was</v>
<v Speaker 4>killing all their livestock is hyena</v>

964

<v Speaker 4>they had to get up in the middle of the</v>

966

<v Speaker 4>night and then drive there super early</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the morning before the sun came up to</v>

<v Speaker 2>werewolf.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's tearing apart this cow and I'm</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's so fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Men.</v>

<v Speaker 2>there's other countries that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>tropical.</v>

979
00:44:57.780 --> 00:44:59.760
<v Speaker 2>There's other crunch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it means africa's,</v>

980
00:45:00.330 --> 00:45:03.690
<v Speaker 2>it is insane how big that place is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't even been.</v>

981
00:45:04.110 --> 00:45:07.290
<v Speaker 2>I was going to go this summer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I found out that you have to take</v>

982
00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:10.110
<v Speaker 2>malaria shots and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to have a malaria</v>

983
00:45:10.111 --> 00:45:12.630
<v Speaker 2>medication to my kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck that.</v>

984
00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:14.910
<v Speaker 2>Fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those shots.</v>

985
00:45:14.911 --> 00:45:17.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a fan of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The malaria ones are supposed to be</v>

986
00:45:17.641 --> 00:45:20.740
<v Speaker 2>particularly abrasive on your body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's,</v>

987
00:45:20.770 --> 00:45:23.520
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to see my kids walking</v>
<v Speaker 2>around poison just because I thought it</v>

988
00:45:23.521 --> 00:45:25.110
<v Speaker 2>would be cool to go see an elephant.</v>

989
00:45:25.110 --> 00:45:29.760
<v Speaker 2>It's natural environment</v>
<v Speaker 2>to live on my own.</v>

990
00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:32.490
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it would be fucking cool to see</v>

991
00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:33.840
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

992
00:45:33.841 --> 00:45:36.450
<v Speaker 2>Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the africans I met with so real,</v>

993
00:45:36.930 --> 00:45:41.190
<v Speaker 2>but they broke down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The white man will theory to me,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Not african.</v>

996

<v Speaker 2>black people saying,</v>

1000
00:45:54.121 --> 00:45:56.220
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not african americans because they</v>

1001
00:45:56.221 --> 00:45:58.680
<v Speaker 2>consider themselves african americans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1002
00:45:58.681 --> 00:46:01.310
<v Speaker 2>I had a buddy of mine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to africa to another black guy</v>

1003
00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:03.000

<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>

1005
00:46:03.571 --> 00:46:05.580
<v Speaker 2>don't don't ever call yourself an</v>
<v Speaker 2>african american.</v>

1006
00:46:05.970 --> 00:46:07.110
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you go over there.</v>

1007
00:46:07.111 --> 00:46:08.040
<v Speaker 2>He goeS,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't like it.</v>

1008
00:46:08.740 --> 00:46:09.720
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't like you.</v>

1009
00:46:10.250 --> 00:46:12.960
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to see you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're jealous and they get angry</v>

1010
00:46:12.961 --> 00:46:14.970
<v Speaker 2>at you and they want to fuck you up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I go,</v>

<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

1012
00:46:16.111 --> 00:46:17.760
<v Speaker 2>don't ever think you're going back to</v>
<v Speaker 2>africa?</v>

1013
00:46:17.761 --> 00:46:20.190
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's weird because you see people</v>

1014
00:46:20.191 --> 00:46:22.080
<v Speaker 2>holding up the fist and all this other</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>

1015
00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:25.680
<v Speaker 2>but we're so far removed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can send us a group of people that,</v>

1016
00:46:26.370 --> 00:46:28.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the things have happened in our past.</v>

1017
00:46:28.380 --> 00:46:31.020
<v Speaker 2>So we're afraid of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we don't know how future looks</v>

1018
00:46:31.021 --> 00:46:31.930
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1019
00:46:31.931 --> 00:46:36.320
<v Speaker 2>it seems cool to have this idea that</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's africa and it's like,</v>

1020
00:46:37.090 --> 00:46:40.880
<v Speaker 2>like fucking narnia or like it's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like the,</v>

1021
00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:42.830
<v Speaker 2>the blue people that lived in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1022
00:46:43.530 --> 00:46:46.110
<v Speaker 2>the fucking avatar avatar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was that planet?</v>

1023
00:46:47.660 --> 00:46:51.630
<v Speaker 2>The planet they lived on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what about the name of those</v>

1024
00:46:51.631 --> 00:46:55.980
<v Speaker 2>trees with beautiful matt?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like I read it reminded me of other</v>

1025
00:46:56.100 --> 00:46:59.280
<v Speaker 2>tanium.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pandora.</v>

1026
00:46:59.310 --> 00:47:00.730
<v Speaker 2>Pandora.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dora.</v>

1027
00:47:00.970 --> 00:47:04.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pandora or I'm pandora and dora.</v>

1028
00:47:05.050 --> 00:47:07.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's hilarious.</v>

1029
00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:12.910
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I remember like the way people would</v>

1030
00:47:12.931 --> 00:47:15.830
<v Speaker 2>think of a native american life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>

1031
00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:17.210
<v Speaker 2>it's really similar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1032
00:47:17.211 --> 00:47:19.200
<v Speaker 2>I think they'd had this idealic</v>
<v Speaker 2>existence.</v>

1033
00:47:19.530 --> 00:47:22.020
<v Speaker 2>It was beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They lived in harmony with nature.</v>

1034
00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:25.230
<v Speaker 2>They only killed what they needed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's no war.</v>

1035
00:47:25.290 --> 00:47:29.440
<v Speaker 2>Like I've had a bizarre conversation</v>
<v Speaker 2>with hippies about north America,</v>

1036
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:33.430
<v Speaker 4>but native americans,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and not that I'm anti native american,</v>

1037
00:47:33.470 --> 00:47:38.470
<v Speaker 4>I'm by far the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it is insanely cool that this</v>

1038
00:47:39.670 --> 00:47:44.050
<v Speaker 4>place was populated just a few hundred</v>
<v Speaker 4>years ago by people that were</v>

1039
00:47:44.051 --> 00:47:48.060
<v Speaker 4>essentially living the way people live</v>
<v Speaker 4>tens of thousands of years ago.</v>

1040
00:47:48.490 --> 00:47:50.410
<v Speaker 4>And they were successful at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were,</v>

1041
00:47:50.470 --> 00:47:51.970
<v Speaker 4>they didn't even horses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1042
00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:54.160
<v Speaker 4>They didn't have horses until european</v>
<v Speaker 4>settlers.</v>

1043
00:47:54.170 --> 00:47:57.970
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of people don't realize</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's even more fucking weird about</v>

1044
00:47:57.971 --> 00:48:01.420
<v Speaker 4>that is that horses actually evolved in</v>
<v Speaker 4>north America.</v>

1045
00:48:01.690 --> 00:48:06.690
<v Speaker 4>Horses started in north America and made</v>
<v Speaker 4>their way to africa on land masses and</v>

1046
00:48:07.181 --> 00:48:10.120
<v Speaker 4>became zebras the course of millions of</v>
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>

1047
00:48:10.930 --> 00:48:14.140
<v Speaker 4>This is a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the weirdest things about plains</v>

1048
00:48:14.141 --> 00:48:17.830
<v Speaker 4>indians and horses is that they didn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>really have them,</v>

1049
00:48:18.010 --> 00:48:20.350
<v Speaker 4>but they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's some belief.</v>

1050
00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:23.410
<v Speaker 4>this is all from this guy dan flores,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's a,</v>

1051
00:48:23.411 --> 00:48:25.370
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess you would call it an</v>

1052
00:48:25.371 --> 00:48:26.830
<v Speaker 4>environmental historian.</v>

1053
00:48:27.010 --> 00:48:29.410
<v Speaker 4>I think that's what he's called.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1054
00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:32.740
<v Speaker 4>but I'm reading one of his books on</v>
<v Speaker 4>coyotes.</v>

1055
00:48:32.741 --> 00:48:36.160
<v Speaker 4>But when he was talking about north</v>
<v Speaker 4>America that they almost,</v>

1056
00:48:36.550 --> 00:48:39.250
<v Speaker 4>they had like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>almost like a myth about,</v>

1057
00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:40.810
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>about horses.</v>

1058
00:48:40.811 --> 00:48:45.220
<v Speaker 4>Like it's possible that at one point in</v>
<v Speaker 4>time they had domesticated horses</v>

1059
00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:48.730
<v Speaker 4>somewhere in north America,</v>
<v Speaker 4>killed tens of thousands of years ago.</v>

1060
00:48:48.731 --> 00:48:52.000
<v Speaker 4>But this is all like pre ice age,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ice age,</v>

1061
00:48:52.001 --> 00:48:54.120
<v Speaker 4>hits,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ice age thaws out like a lot.</v>

1062
00:48:54.121 --> 00:48:57.580
<v Speaker 4>A lot of shit has gone down here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But those people,</v>

1063
00:48:57.970 --> 00:49:01.240
<v Speaker 4>they did not live in avatar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Existence Is my point.</v>

1064
00:49:01.510 --> 00:49:04.270
<v Speaker 4>Like native americans,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we would go to war with each other.</v>

1065
00:49:04.271 --> 00:49:06.700
<v Speaker 4>They fucking kill each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They do horrible things.</v>

1066
00:49:07.030 --> 00:49:10.600
<v Speaker 4>The ones in the great lakes area,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they did a lot of cannibalism.</v>

1067
00:49:10.630 --> 00:49:12.340
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The nez perce,</v>

1068
00:49:12.341 --> 00:49:14.410
<v Speaker 4>I think they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the name of the indian they were talking</v>

1069
00:49:14.411 --> 00:49:15.130
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were like,</v>

1070
00:49:15.130 --> 00:49:16.360
<v Speaker 4>kill their enemies and shIt.</v>

1071
00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:18.820
<v Speaker 4>They would find trappers and kill them</v>
<v Speaker 4>and eat them.</v>

1072
00:49:19.590 --> 00:49:23.260
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it was not this beautiful world,</v>

1073
00:49:23.290 --> 00:49:25.990
<v Speaker 4>but dave's doing the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I thinK it's just a matter of</v>

1074
00:49:25.991 --> 00:49:27.010
<v Speaker 4>resources.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1075
00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:29.110
<v Speaker 4>That's how I look at a light or.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1076
00:49:29.270 --> 00:49:31.720
<v Speaker 4>that's also the same reason why racism</v>
<v Speaker 4>exists.</v>

1077
00:49:31.810 --> 00:49:34.720
<v Speaker 4>It's like people get in this us versus</v>
<v Speaker 4>them thing.</v>

1078
00:49:34.820 --> 00:49:37.420
<v Speaker 4>We want these people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whoever these people are,</v>

1079
00:49:37.421 --> 00:49:38.920
<v Speaker 4>they want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>

1080
00:49:38.950 --> 00:49:42.610
<v Speaker 4>Everybody has to be on this team and</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck everybody else because that's the</v>

1081
00:49:42.611 --> 00:49:44.620
<v Speaker 4>only way they feel like they can</v>
<v Speaker 4>survive.</v>

1082
00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:46.470
<v Speaker 4>That's the oLd way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1083
00:49:47.050 --> 00:49:51.010
<v Speaker 4>but what's interesting to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think is that in this day and age,</v>

1084
00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:55.540
<v Speaker 4>thAt old way is just melting in front of</v>
<v Speaker 4>our eyes because people understand each</v>

1085
00:49:55.541 --> 00:49:57.220
<v Speaker 4>other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean white people,</v>

1086
00:49:57.221 --> 00:50:01.000
<v Speaker 4>that black lives movement hashtagged on</v>
<v Speaker 4>their fucking twitter page.</v>

1087
00:50:01.350 --> 00:50:06.100
<v Speaker 4>A fuck load man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many people today are racist and</v>

1088
00:50:06.101 --> 00:50:08.800
<v Speaker 4>compare it to a hundred years ago it was</v>
<v Speaker 4>probably radically lower.</v>

1089
00:50:08.830 --> 00:50:10.540
<v Speaker 4>Is lower.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing.</v>

1090
00:50:10.550 --> 00:50:14.470
<v Speaker 4>Like how white women want to fuck black</v>
<v Speaker 4>dudes because of this thing.</v>

1091
00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:15.970
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So in a way,</v>

1092
00:50:16.540 --> 00:50:19.540
<v Speaker 4>it's not all for nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what it's like to.</v>

1093
00:50:19.570 --> 00:50:22.300
<v Speaker 4>It's like your first liner,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your first responder,</v>

1094
00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:25.750
<v Speaker 4>like the nine slash 11 firemen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They got mad pussy after nine slash 11.</v>

1095
00:50:26.140 --> 00:50:29.270
<v Speaker 4>Those guys were superstars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Girls would just fuck firemen for real,</v>

1096
00:50:29.660 --> 00:50:32.330
<v Speaker 4>especially if a girl worked in a</v>
<v Speaker 4>building that was close to where the</v>

1097
00:50:32.331 --> 00:50:35.030
<v Speaker 4>towers went down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like those guys were goddamn heroes</v>

1098
00:50:35.031 --> 00:50:36.980
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All their hero genes fired up.</v>

1099
00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:39.200
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if that's what makes men want</v>

1100
00:50:39.201 --> 00:50:41.210
<v Speaker 4>to do it in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They know that women are going to think</v>

1101
00:50:41.211 --> 00:50:42.200
<v Speaker 4>through heroes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck them.</v>

1102
00:50:42.910 --> 00:50:45.520
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think guys like want to be the alpha,</v>

1103
00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:46.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a certain.</v>

1104
00:50:46.780 --> 00:50:49.240
<v Speaker 1>I found my plAce to be an alpha,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

1105
00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:52.870
<v Speaker 1>So if I was a black guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would probably play up racism big time</v>

1106
00:50:52.871 --> 00:50:56.680
<v Speaker 1>just for white pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However you could play it up</v>

1107
00:50:58.210 --> 00:51:00.940
<v Speaker 1>its chicks that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that told me yet now you just want to</v>

1108
00:51:00.941 --> 00:51:02.830
<v Speaker 1>make out with black dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they feel nothing they could do.</v>

1109
00:51:02.831 --> 00:51:05.740
<v Speaker 1>so they just want to make out what black</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy and they could do.</v>

1110
00:51:05.770 --> 00:51:08.260
<v Speaker 1>They feel they feel so whatever about</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's happening.</v>

1111
00:51:08.550 --> 00:51:11.080
<v Speaker 1>Oh they want to just make out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to make,</v>

1112
00:51:11.410 --> 00:51:13.510
<v Speaker 1>make it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could you somehow.</v>

1113
00:51:13.780 --> 00:51:15.120
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1114
00:51:15.370 --> 00:51:17.230
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a few videos that have come out</v>

1115
00:51:17.231 --> 00:51:20.980
<v Speaker 1>this year to just every where</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's got to go.</v>

1116
00:51:21.490 --> 00:51:22.323
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1117
00:51:22.890 --> 00:51:26.740
<v Speaker 4>we'll now give me an excuse now explain</v>
<v Speaker 4>it now.</v>

1118
00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:30.070
<v Speaker 4>There's a few that are like the one that</v>
<v Speaker 4>the guy got shot in his car,</v>

1119
00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:35.220
<v Speaker 4>reaching for his wallet with his wife</v>
<v Speaker 4>and kid in the car with you telling me</v>

1120
00:51:35.681 --> 00:51:37.180
<v Speaker 4>these things don't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because everybody was like,</v>

1121
00:51:37.210 --> 00:51:39.460
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's how they said it went down.</v>

1122
00:51:39.461 --> 00:51:41.990
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the guy probably said something or he</v>

1123
00:51:41.991 --> 00:51:45.760
<v Speaker 4>went and reached for something or maybe</v>
<v Speaker 4>he had a record.</v>

1124
00:51:45.970 --> 00:51:47.920
<v Speaker 4>Maybe they knew this guy was a</v>
<v Speaker 4>dangerous.</v>

1125
00:51:47.950 --> 00:51:48.990
<v Speaker 4>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nope,</v>

1126
00:51:49.650 --> 00:51:50.550
<v Speaker 4>nope,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nope,</v>

1127
00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:52.870
<v Speaker 4>nope.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just to dude complying,</v>

1128
00:51:53.020 --> 00:51:58.020
<v Speaker 4>reaching for his wallet and gets</v>
<v Speaker 4>unloaded on by some fucking psycho,</v>

1129
00:51:58.061 --> 00:52:03.061
<v Speaker 4>some stressed out ptsd.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who knows what the fuck is going on in</v>

1130
00:52:03.851 --> 00:52:05.860
<v Speaker 4>that guy's head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who knows?</v>

1131
00:52:06.070 --> 00:52:07.480
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of The things I thought was</v>

1132
00:52:07.481 --> 00:52:09.610
<v Speaker 4>interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they had this video online recently that</v>

1133
00:52:09.611 --> 00:52:11.880
<v Speaker 4>I saw it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1134
00:52:12.070 --> 00:52:15.660
<v Speaker 4>they took this guy who was an active,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1135
00:52:15.730 --> 00:52:20.730
<v Speaker 4>he was a big time detractor of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>police who's talking about how horrible</v>

1136
00:52:21.011 --> 00:52:21.820
<v Speaker 4>the police are.</v>

1137
00:52:21.820 --> 00:52:26.820
<v Speaker 4>And they invited him to go through like</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of their police training safety</v>

1138
00:52:26.831 --> 00:52:29.070
<v Speaker 4>courses.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what they do is they,</v>

1139
00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:33.040
<v Speaker 4>you're supposed to determine when to</v>
<v Speaker 4>shoot or when you,</v>

1140
00:52:33.100 --> 00:52:34.500
<v Speaker 4>when you can get shot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>

1141
00:52:34.501 --> 00:52:36.370
<v Speaker 4>when someone can be a threat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you have to shoot them.</v>

1142
00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:40.420
<v Speaker 4>It was fucking amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing to watch because this guy</v>

1143
00:52:40.421 --> 00:52:44.260
<v Speaker 4>in just a few of these scenarios started</v>
<v Speaker 4>freaking out.</v>

1144
00:52:44.500 --> 00:52:46.840
<v Speaker 4>like he got shot in a couple of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When they shoot you,</v>

1145
00:52:46.990 --> 00:52:49.810
<v Speaker 4>they shoot at the ground in front of you</v>
<v Speaker 4>with a blank.</v>

1146
00:52:50.110 --> 00:52:50.780
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like.</v>

1147
00:52:50.780 --> 00:52:54.880
<v Speaker 4>So you had to realize that this is how</v>
<v Speaker 4>quick a cop can get shot by a psycho.</v>

1148
00:52:55.320 --> 00:52:58.630
<v Speaker 4>And so there's different times where he</v>
<v Speaker 4>got pulled over,</v>

1149
00:52:58.890 --> 00:53:02.680
<v Speaker 4>he pulled someone over or where he was</v>
<v Speaker 4>handling this one guy in a parking lot</v>

1150
00:53:02.950 --> 00:53:05.650
<v Speaker 4>and the guy went behind the car real</v>
<v Speaker 4>quick and they came out and shot him</v>

1151
00:53:05.651 --> 00:53:07.120
<v Speaker 4>like within a second,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1152
00:53:07.121 --> 00:53:07.954
<v Speaker 4>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sir,</v>

1153
00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:10.060
<v Speaker 4>can I see some identification,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sir?</v>

1154
00:53:10.180 --> 00:53:10.871
<v Speaker 4>Yeah man.</v>

<v Speaker 2>just not just looking at what's</v>

1270
00:58:04.961 --> 00:58:07.420
<v Speaker 2>happening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like looking at where they're like super</v>

1271
00:58:07.421 --> 00:58:11.530
<v Speaker 2>dangerous spots and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the in the mindset and the lack of</v>

1272
00:58:11.531 --> 00:58:14.620
<v Speaker 2>the so called lack of resources people</v>
<v Speaker 2>think they have.</v>

1273
00:58:14.720 --> 00:58:16.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1274
00:58:17.110 --> 00:58:19.240
<v Speaker 2>I all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you say lack of resources,</v>

1275
00:58:19.241 --> 00:58:21.320
<v Speaker 2>you mean no hope for the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1276
00:58:21.321 --> 00:58:23.140
<v Speaker 2>it just fear based.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I got to eat.</v>

1277
00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:25.450
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the power company don't care that,</v>

1278
00:58:25.860 --> 00:58:27.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you all love each other and you're</v>

1279
00:58:27.341 --> 00:58:29.830
<v Speaker 2>trying to go to better your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1280
00:58:30.970 --> 00:58:33.640
<v Speaker 2>And Sometimes your lady,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your girl don't even want to heAr that</v>

1281
00:58:33.641 --> 00:58:37.330
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that is a big part of what keeps</v>

1282
00:58:37.331 --> 00:58:39.970
<v Speaker 2>these communities exactly the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1283
00:58:39.971 --> 00:58:44.200
<v Speaker 2>there's a dude named eddie wong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a chef and an author and he's done</v>

1284
00:58:44.201 --> 00:58:46.380
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of cool shit and he's funny</v>
<v Speaker 2>dudes.</v>

1285
00:58:46.390 --> 00:58:51.390
<v Speaker 2>Got a show on vice and he brought up</v>
<v Speaker 2>this idea of universal basic income and</v>

1286
00:58:51.791 --> 00:58:52.541
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1287
00:58:52.541 --> 00:58:56.410
<v Speaker 2>just giving people enough money every</v>
<v Speaker 2>year so they live,</v>

1288
00:58:56.530 --> 00:58:57.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you don't have to worry about your</v>

1289
00:58:57.731 --> 00:58:58.450
<v Speaker 2>bills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to.</v>

1290
00:58:58.450 --> 00:59:00.070
<v Speaker 2>Everything's paid for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1291
00:59:00.370 --> 00:59:01.930
<v Speaker 2>Everything after that you have to work</v>
<v Speaker 2>for.</v>

1292
00:59:02.470 --> 00:59:04.960
<v Speaker 2>And I remember thinking time is fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous.</v>

1293
00:59:04.961 --> 00:59:06.400
<v Speaker 2>You can't get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People think people are going to get</v>

1294
00:59:06.401 --> 00:59:07.760
<v Speaker 2>fucking lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just not,</v>

1295
00:59:07.780 --> 00:59:09.250
<v Speaker 2>that is not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not gonna work.</v>

1296
00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:13.810
<v Speaker 2>But now the more I think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more I think of that might be like</v>

1297
00:59:13.811 --> 00:59:18.811
<v Speaker 2>the best way to curb crime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the curb need to curb people doing</v>

1298
00:59:19.661 --> 00:59:22.190
<v Speaker 2>things at a total desperation to,</v>

1299
00:59:22.220 --> 00:59:24.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to curb A certain amount of despair that</v>

1300
00:59:24.801 --> 00:59:27.650
<v Speaker 1>some people feel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then from there it might be like a</v>

1301
00:59:27.651 --> 00:59:32.651
<v Speaker 1>jumpstart for people pursuing other</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas that might successfully contribute</v>

1302
00:59:32.811 --> 00:59:34.510
<v Speaker 1>to the economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm,</v>

1303
00:59:34.530 --> 00:59:38.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't know enough about the economy to</v>
<v Speaker 1>really comment is I'm just reading a</v>

1304
00:59:38.901 --> 00:59:41.300
<v Speaker 1>bunch of different things a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have said about it.</v>

1305
00:59:41.301 --> 00:59:42.140
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1306
00:59:42.141 --> 00:59:45.650
<v Speaker 1>so it might actually make sense in terms</v>
<v Speaker 1>of law enforcement,</v>

1307
00:59:46.010 --> 00:59:49.640
<v Speaker 1>in terms of unemployment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like all sorts of different things you</v>

1308
00:59:49.641 --> 00:59:53.300
<v Speaker 1>would have to factor in like where the</v>
<v Speaker 1>money would come from.</v>

1309
00:59:53.600 --> 00:59:54.560
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1310
00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:58.070
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of counterintuitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But once you look into what you like,</v>

1311
00:59:58.110 --> 01:00:01.970
<v Speaker 1>look if how many of these people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are super desperate and don't have money</v>

1312
01:00:01.971 --> 01:00:03.360
<v Speaker 1>for bills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no jobs.</v>

1313
01:00:03.890 --> 01:00:08.890
<v Speaker 1>How many of those people would relax a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot if they got x amount of dollars a</v>

1314
01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:10.650
<v Speaker 1>year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>

1315
01:00:10.650 --> 01:00:11.600
<v Speaker 1>they would survive.</v>

1316
01:00:11.660 --> 01:00:13.430
<v Speaker 1>I know like with myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1317
01:00:13.431 --> 01:00:15.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm around people that make money now</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they like,</v>

1318
01:00:15.801 --> 01:00:17.810
<v Speaker 1>money's not important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm like,</v>

1319
01:00:17.811 --> 01:00:20.540
<v Speaker 1>you made it to the mountaintop already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1320
01:00:20.541 --> 01:00:24.230
<v Speaker 1>You made a certain income,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you're surviving you don't have</v>

1321
01:00:24.380 --> 01:00:29.380
<v Speaker 1>time to feel things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have time to be philosophical,</v>

1322
01:00:29.391 --> 01:00:30.260
<v Speaker 1>to fail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1323
01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:33.350
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I'm sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1324
01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:34.940
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or these things.</v>

1325
01:00:34.941 --> 01:00:38.870
<v Speaker 1>Like I even look at my mom definitely</v>
<v Speaker 1>now because she had at one point lost</v>

1326
01:00:38.871 --> 01:00:43.871
<v Speaker 1>her children and she had to get them</v>
<v Speaker 1>back and she raised us in survival mode</v>

1327
01:00:43.941 --> 01:00:48.110
<v Speaker 1>so she never thought or reading a self</v>
<v Speaker 1>help book or learn how to money manage</v>

1328
01:00:48.490 --> 01:00:50.390
<v Speaker 1>all those things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

1329
01:00:50.530 --> 01:00:53.840
<v Speaker 1>And me and my sister had a place now</v>
<v Speaker 1>where we could do those things,</v>

1330
01:00:53.930 --> 01:00:56.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can talk about,</v>

1331
01:00:56.570 --> 01:00:59.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how we feel or even look back and see</v>

1332
01:00:59.601 --> 01:01:00.500
<v Speaker 1>where we went wrong.</v>

1333
01:01:00.830 --> 01:01:03.410
<v Speaker 1>And tHat's just a luxury that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1334
01:01:03.950 --> 01:01:05.060
<v Speaker 1>I see what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My mother,</v>

1335
01:01:05.061 --> 01:01:06.560
<v Speaker 1>who was a father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mother,</v>

1336
01:01:06.561 --> 01:01:10.530
<v Speaker 1>a woman who becomes a guy and take</v>
<v Speaker 1>though roles on it,</v>

1337
01:01:10.550 --> 01:01:13.550
<v Speaker 1>does something to her emotionally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

1338
01:01:14.450 --> 01:01:15.830
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1339
01:01:15.831 --> 01:01:17.290
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1340
01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:23.060
<v Speaker 1>when the kids is gone now she might have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a chance to grow and see what things</v>

1341
01:01:23.061 --> 01:01:25.340
<v Speaker 1>went wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If she doesn't feel it's too late.</v>

1342
01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:28.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in survival mode,</v>

1343
01:01:28.341 --> 01:01:33.260
<v Speaker 1>I try to tell people that who tried to</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about these issues but never have</v>

1344
01:01:33.470 --> 01:01:37.910
<v Speaker 1>been in this situation before and feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>the need to go out and see why people</v>

1345
01:01:37.911 --> 01:01:41.740
<v Speaker 1>get out and don't look back or they try</v>
<v Speaker 1>to help people and people concentrating</v>

1346
01:01:41.750 --> 01:01:43.760
<v Speaker 1>on other things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason why.</v>

1347
01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:46.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That.</v>

1348
01:01:46.340 --> 01:01:48.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the survIval mode is very primal.</v>

1349
01:01:49.630 --> 01:01:50.900
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the law,</v>

1350
01:01:51.020 --> 01:01:54.700
<v Speaker 1>the law don't matter and survival model</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a.</v>

1351
01:01:54.710 --> 01:01:56.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can take things.</v>

1352
01:01:56.091 --> 01:01:58.940
<v Speaker 1>You could run up in this door and take</v>
<v Speaker 1>things because you just that hungry.</v>

<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>

1354
01:02:02.490 --> 01:02:04.400
<v Speaker 1>I've seen and been a part of all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1355
01:02:04.401 --> 01:02:06.800
<v Speaker 1>You like clothes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want luxury stuff to the point that</v>

1356
01:02:06.801 --> 01:02:08.420
<v Speaker 1>you would take it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1357
01:02:08.421 --> 01:02:11.560
<v Speaker 1>go to the mall and take a polo shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1358
01:02:11.780 --> 01:02:12.970
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1360
01:02:16.221 --> 01:02:20.130
<v Speaker 1>Survival mode is a place that most have</v>
<v Speaker 1>no idea,</v>

1361
01:02:20.190 --> 01:02:21.870
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most people would just guessing me</v>

1362
01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:23.550
<v Speaker 4>included,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just guessing.</v>

1363
01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:25.520
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as people that is in a situation even</v>

1364
01:02:25.521 --> 01:02:28.500
<v Speaker 1>worse than mine and I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1365
01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:29.640
<v Speaker 1>You see what it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1366
01:02:29.790 --> 01:02:33.500
<v Speaker 1>it does the people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And after a while they kind of like it.</v>

1367
01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:37.310
<v Speaker 1>They might make six figures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they still go to the projects</v>

1368
01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:40.100
<v Speaker 1>because it's exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's exciting.</v>

1369
01:02:40.340 --> 01:02:44.480
<v Speaker 1>One and two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't communicate with people</v>

1370
01:02:44.481 --> 01:02:46.490
<v Speaker 1>who've been making 100,000 they whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

1371
01:02:46.491 --> 01:02:47.540
<v Speaker 1>I grew up in that situation.</v>

1372
01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:48.121
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1373
01:02:48.121 --> 01:02:50.250
<v Speaker 4>that's a big thing with people that go</v>
<v Speaker 4>to war.</v>

1374
01:02:50.430 --> 01:02:53.220
<v Speaker 4>People that have been to war,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they for some reason,</v>

1375
01:02:53.221 --> 01:02:56.580
<v Speaker 4>even though it was awful and saw friends</v>
<v Speaker 4>die.</v>

1376
01:02:56.820 --> 01:02:58.920
<v Speaker 4>It was the best time of their life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1377
01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:03.810
<v Speaker 4>It's like there's something about living</v>
<v Speaker 4>knowing that any moment you could be</v>

1378
01:03:03.811 --> 01:03:07.560
<v Speaker 4>dead that makes the live moments,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the moments where you're not that more</v>

1379
01:03:07.561 --> 01:03:11.400
<v Speaker 4>special and then you come back here and</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything's sort of muted.</v>

1380
01:03:11.910 --> 01:03:13.830
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just tone down.</v>

1381
01:03:13.950 --> 01:03:16.050
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's why a lot of rich people,</v>

1382
01:03:16.290 --> 01:03:18.180
<v Speaker 4>they start,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they don't have any meaning in their</v>

1383
01:03:18.181 --> 01:03:19.770
<v Speaker 4>life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't have a thing that they're</v>

1384
01:03:19.771 --> 01:03:22.020
<v Speaker 4>really into.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just start buying shit.</v>

1385
01:03:22.590 --> 01:03:26.460
<v Speaker 4>They just start collecting houses and</v>
<v Speaker 4>boats and they're just trying to figure</v>

1386
01:03:26.461 --> 01:03:28.680
<v Speaker 4>out there's got to be something exciting</v>
<v Speaker 4>to do here.</v>

1387
01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:29.660
<v Speaker 4>There's got to be something.</v>

1388
01:03:29.660 --> 01:03:30.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>

1389
01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:34.730
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once I started making like $30,000 a</v>

1390
01:03:34.731 --> 01:03:37.940
<v Speaker 1>year doing a standup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it changed me because I came,</v>

1391
01:03:37.941 --> 01:03:40.280
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't invited to la.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I slept on the floor for a year.</v>

1392
01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:43.970
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did the whole car thing and built</v>

1393
01:03:44.060 --> 01:03:46.100
<v Speaker 1>everything up from there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He lived in out of the car.</v>

1394
01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:48.290
<v Speaker 1>You were doing that for like a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks,</v>

1395
01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:50.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but everybody's got a cool story that</v>

1396
01:03:50.931 --> 01:03:53.390
<v Speaker 1>makes it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that might make it that I know a lot of</v>

1397
01:03:53.391 --> 01:03:56.660
<v Speaker 1>people like rhonda rousey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She had a cool living out of that was a</v>

1398
01:03:56.661 --> 01:03:58.990
<v Speaker 1>very interesting interview.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of emotional,</v>

1399
01:04:00.090 --> 01:04:01.940
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people that live in out of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>car,</v>

1400
01:04:02.060 --> 01:04:04.310
<v Speaker 1>you be to meet x.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's kinda normal for la.</v>

1401
01:04:04.910 --> 01:04:07.270
<v Speaker 1>But I figured,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I made it cop.</v>

1402
01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:08.140
<v Speaker 1>Pardon me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think I made him.</v>

1403
01:04:08.150 --> 01:04:11.660
<v Speaker 1>I graduate from college because I was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fresh graduate from college and I was</v>

1404
01:04:11.661 --> 01:04:13.250
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to unlearn everything I was</v>

1405
01:04:13.251 --> 01:04:14.084
<v Speaker 1>taught.</v>
<v Speaker 1>now</v>

1406
01:04:15.710 --> 01:04:17.960
<v Speaker 1>how so?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's institutionalized thinking</v>

1407
01:04:17.990 --> 01:04:19.820
<v Speaker 1>to me there's no difference between the</v>
<v Speaker 1>university.</v>

1408
01:04:19.850 --> 01:04:21.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no difference between college</v>

1409
01:04:21.501 --> 01:04:24.740
<v Speaker 1>and prison sometimes to meet what bay</v>
<v Speaker 1>way different.</v>

1410
01:04:24.741 --> 01:04:26.180
<v Speaker 1>You can quit college.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1411
01:04:26.181 --> 01:04:27.620
<v Speaker 1>yeah you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't.</v>

1412
01:04:27.650 --> 01:04:29.510
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1413
01:04:29.511 --> 01:04:32.680
<v Speaker 1>both get money for how many occupants</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have and right.</v>

1414
01:04:32.810 --> 01:04:37.220
<v Speaker 1>I Look at those stats and they teach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You assert it's a society within both,</v>

1415
01:04:37.490 --> 01:04:39.920
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then even the military,</v>

1416
01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:41.840
<v Speaker 1>because I went to Afghanistan for 13</v>
<v Speaker 1>days,</v>

1417
01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:44.610
<v Speaker 1>I think colleges are incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 1>important,</v>

1418
01:04:44.940 --> 01:04:49.940
<v Speaker 4>but I think that like all things when</v>
<v Speaker 4>the world around them evolved quicker</v>

1419
01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:55.290
<v Speaker 4>than they do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it creates issues and I think a lot of</v>

1420
01:04:55.291 --> 01:04:56.870
<v Speaker 4>what you're seeing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>

1421
01:04:56.930 --> 01:05:01.140
<v Speaker 4>I've talked to some kids who go to</v>
<v Speaker 4>school that are taking these classes</v>

1422
01:05:01.141 --> 01:05:05.370
<v Speaker 4>from ridiculous left wing professors who</v>
<v Speaker 4>are basically communists.</v>

1423
01:05:05.690 --> 01:05:06.523
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>

1424
01:05:06.770 --> 01:05:09.720
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>IT's not just a few and this left wing</v>

1425
01:05:09.750 --> 01:05:13.650
<v Speaker 4>thinking is like super uber prevalent on</v>
<v Speaker 4>campus to the point where it's like</v>

1426
01:05:13.651 --> 01:05:18.651
<v Speaker 4>distorting kid's versions and views of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the world and it's trickled down.</v>

1427
01:05:18.761 --> 01:05:22.390
<v Speaker 4>It's the students is to faculty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot going on.</v>

1428
01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:25.480
<v Speaker 4>It's ultimately a lot of it is like the</v>
<v Speaker 4>people at the very top of it all.</v>

1429
01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:30.370
<v Speaker 4>It's really kind of fascinating because</v>
<v Speaker 4>those people are shaping people's minds</v>

1430
01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:35.950
<v Speaker 4>and they're involved in a lot of ways</v>
<v Speaker 4>from what comes out of that in a</v>

1431
01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:38.710
<v Speaker 4>cultural sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's a lot of backlash because</v>

1432
01:05:38.740 --> 01:05:41.120
<v Speaker 4>that too is a lot of people that are</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to those schools and now we're</v>

1433
01:05:41.121 --> 01:05:46.121
<v Speaker 4>reading online accounts of what these</v>
<v Speaker 4>professors do and how these.</v>

1434
01:05:46.750 --> 01:05:50.560
<v Speaker 4>A lot of these professors have zero</v>
<v Speaker 4>experience in the world itself.</v>

1435
01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:53.080
<v Speaker 4>They just live in academia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

1436
01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:57.040
<v Speaker 4>they get the degree can go from getting</v>
<v Speaker 4>a degree to teaching and they teach and</v>

1437
01:05:57.041 --> 01:06:01.090
<v Speaker 4>they just don't enter the world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they live in this world of these sort</v>

1438
01:06:01.091 --> 01:06:06.091
<v Speaker 4>of esoteric ideas or these philosophies</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they would like to be real but</v>

1439
01:06:07.331 --> 01:06:10.660
<v Speaker 4>might not necessarily be real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They teach kids.</v>

1440
01:06:10.970 --> 01:06:14.800
<v Speaker 1>I was kind of fortunate in that because</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I test,</v>

1441
01:06:14.810 --> 01:06:19.730
<v Speaker 1>I took some weird tests in elementary</v>
<v Speaker 1>school that sent me to these schools,</v>

1442
01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:23.720
<v Speaker 1>a upper middle class high school and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just figure it out.</v>

1443
01:06:23.721 --> 01:06:25.190
<v Speaker 1>You're smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1444
01:06:25.191 --> 01:06:28.020
<v Speaker 1>but It alienated me from my community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

1445
01:06:28.190 --> 01:06:30.080
<v Speaker 1>like my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got bused to a school,</v>

1446
01:06:30.081 --> 01:06:33.680
<v Speaker 1>so everybody in my apartment complex got</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the bus and went to school And then</v>

1447
01:06:33.681 --> 01:06:38.570
<v Speaker 1>we got separated to where it was like</v>
<v Speaker 1>five black people in this class and when</v>

1448
01:06:38.571 --> 01:06:42.320
<v Speaker 1>we would go to lunch we have to walk on</v>
<v Speaker 1>different sides of the hall and</v>

1449
01:06:42.321 --> 01:06:45.060
<v Speaker 1>everybody in my neighborhood just coming</v>
<v Speaker 1>through the whole stuff.</v>

1450
01:06:45.990 --> 01:06:50.390
<v Speaker 1>So things started to happen then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how could they not see that coming?</v>

1451
01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:52.880
<v Speaker 1>That almost seems like one of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>government experiments,</v>

1452
01:06:53.300 --> 01:06:56.180
<v Speaker 1>lIke a psychological tuskegee</v>
<v Speaker 1>experiment,</v>

1453
01:06:56.840 --> 01:06:58.280
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a sense.</v>

1454
01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:01.910
<v Speaker 1>But what happened was by the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like my professors were like rich</v>

1455
01:07:01.970 --> 01:07:06.650
<v Speaker 1>millionaires because they taught the</v>
<v Speaker 1>subject that they did well in.</v>

1456
01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:07.850
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1457
01:07:08.370 --> 01:07:10.580
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say like a comedy comedian,</v>

1458
01:07:10.670 --> 01:07:14.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean a comedy class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except that that teacher made it right.</v>

1459
01:07:14.870 --> 01:07:17.930
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they write books and they write their</v>

1460
01:07:17.931 --> 01:07:19.700
<v Speaker 1>own books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got millions,</v>

1461
01:07:20.060 --> 01:07:23.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing this because they want to,</v>

1462
01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:24.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they retired already.</v>

1463
01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:28.460
<v Speaker 1>I think my stat teacher retired at 30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

1464
01:07:29.180 --> 01:07:30.130
<v Speaker 1>30.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1465
01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:33.740
<v Speaker 1>He wrote his own book and I didn't like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that goddamn because I couldn't steal</v>

1466
01:07:33.741 --> 01:07:37.580
<v Speaker 1>this book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You couldn't steal It went up because he</v>

1467
01:07:37.581 --> 01:07:39.980
<v Speaker 1>wrote his own book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he gave.</v>

1468
01:07:39.981 --> 01:07:43.170
<v Speaker 1>We had to buy it from him and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he download the uh,</v>

1469
01:07:43.790 --> 01:07:45.110
<v Speaker 1>downloaded somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1470
01:07:45.111 --> 01:07:47.210
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But sold you his aunt.</v>

1471
01:07:47.220 --> 01:07:50.750
<v Speaker 1>He had to sell his books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time a class he taught.</v>

1472
01:07:50.790 --> 01:07:52.190
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's tricky.</v>

1473
01:07:52.191 --> 01:07:56.060
<v Speaker 1>So I went to college my freshman year</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then have books because in high</v>

1474
01:07:56.061 --> 01:07:58.370
<v Speaker 1>school they provided books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>books.</v>

1475
01:07:59.300 --> 01:08:01.940
<v Speaker 1>So I made a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made money to buy a book and they got</v>

1476
01:08:01.970 --> 01:08:05.880
<v Speaker 1>booked buyback programs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they give you 25 percent with a</v>

1477
01:08:05.900 --> 01:08:08.900
<v Speaker 1>book's worth and I just couldn't get</v>
<v Speaker 1>into that.</v>

1478
01:08:09.620 --> 01:08:14.240
<v Speaker 1>So I had this still books and I would</v>
<v Speaker 1>sell the books at 50 percent.</v>

1479
01:08:14.870 --> 01:08:18.980
<v Speaker 1>You steal them and sell them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what would you steal a physical copy</v>

1480
01:08:18.981 --> 01:08:21.290
<v Speaker 1>of the book?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where would you get them from the</v>

1481
01:08:21.291 --> 01:08:23.690
<v Speaker 1>bookstore to snag them from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bookstore?</v>

1482
01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:26.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the thIng that the alarm they</v>

1483
01:08:26.511 --> 01:08:29.600
<v Speaker 1>had where they alarm and it's fun</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the engineering books school,</v>

1484
01:08:29.601 --> 01:08:33.560
<v Speaker 1>but it never was hooked up properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1485
01:08:33.620 --> 01:08:36.350
<v Speaker 1>And I was standing up just to put it in</v>
<v Speaker 1>my waistband and walk out.</v>

1486
01:08:36.470 --> 01:08:38.910
<v Speaker 1>This is all very alleged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Id never really happened.</v>

1487
01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:40.320
<v Speaker 1>Never really happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1488
01:08:40.321 --> 01:08:42.530
<v Speaker 1>This is just fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I was the right cast,</v>

1489
01:08:42.590 --> 01:08:45.020
<v Speaker 1>if I was to write a book though is how</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will be done.</v>

1490
01:08:45.950 --> 01:08:48.290
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I didn't do it like a massive.</v>

1491
01:08:48.380 --> 01:08:50.660
<v Speaker 1>I didn't do massive because I know what</v>
<v Speaker 1>grand theft is.</v>

1492
01:08:50.900 --> 01:08:51.980
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1493
01:08:52.490 --> 01:08:56.350
<v Speaker 1>So it's only a few people that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>supplied and it's easy.</v>

1494
01:08:56.360 --> 01:08:58.100
<v Speaker 1>You buy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you getting it for 50 percent and then</v>

1495
01:08:58.101 --> 01:09:00.410
<v Speaker 1>you can have that money back at the end</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the semester.</v>

1496
01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:01.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good deal.</v>

1497
01:09:03.650 --> 01:09:04.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a pretty good deal when,</v>

1498
01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.460
<v Speaker 1>when except for stealing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stealing,</v>

1499
01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:08.570
<v Speaker 1>stealing part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

1500
01:09:08.620 --> 01:09:12.880
<v Speaker 2>I allegedly might've gotten college</v>
<v Speaker 2>books that way to a lot of super common.</v>

1501
01:09:13.380 --> 01:09:16.240
<v Speaker 2>Well Today kids can just download most</v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

1502
01:09:16.241 --> 01:09:16.571
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1503
01:09:16.571 --> 01:09:18.610
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It must be really hard for them to sell</v>

1504
01:09:18.611 --> 01:09:22.630
<v Speaker 2>their books now because kids can just go</v>
<v Speaker 2>to like a bit torrent because especially</v>

1505
01:09:22.631 --> 01:09:26.020
<v Speaker 2>if there's like a college course that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>an a major university and most likely</v>

1506
01:09:26.021 --> 01:09:28.420
<v Speaker 2>someone's gonna upload it to a torrent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1507
01:09:28.450 --> 01:09:30.670
<v Speaker 2>We assume,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we wasn't tourists.</v>

1508
01:09:31.250 --> 01:09:33.910
<v Speaker 2>I went to school when napster drops,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we was a group.</v>

1509
01:09:34.050 --> 01:09:35.790
<v Speaker 2>Oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's pushed all that for.</v>

1510
01:09:35.890 --> 01:09:39.490
<v Speaker 2>I remember now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember the crazy argument about</v>

1511
01:09:39.491 --> 01:09:43.030
<v Speaker 2>napster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember I had to sit back and go.</v>

1512
01:09:43.300 --> 01:09:46.900
<v Speaker 2>I remember very clearly when that</v>
<v Speaker 2>metallica guy got involved,</v>

1513
01:09:46.990 --> 01:09:51.990
<v Speaker 2>lars ulrich got involved and he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying that this is stealing and and it</v>

1514
01:09:52.171 --> 01:09:55.840
<v Speaker 2>was going crazy and freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember literally sitting back</v>

1515
01:09:56.020 --> 01:09:58.720
<v Speaker 2>because I was listening to it on sirius</v>
<v Speaker 2>satellite radio.</v>

1516
01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:02.680
<v Speaker 2>I Think it wasn't something I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>listening to something on my car.</v>

1517
01:10:03.010 --> 01:10:05.050
<v Speaker 2>What year was that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what year was napster?</v>

1518
01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:08.410
<v Speaker 2>O two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was there even sirius satellite radio.</v>

1519
01:10:08.411 --> 01:10:11.260
<v Speaker 2>My imagine this might have been the</v>
<v Speaker 2>radio actual radio.</v>

1520
01:10:11.350 --> 01:10:15.700
<v Speaker 2>Xm was right around that same time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it might've been whoever was out</v>

1521
01:10:15.701 --> 01:10:16.810
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might have been howard stern.</v>

1522
01:10:17.060 --> 01:10:20.050
<v Speaker 2>it was listening to something and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>were talking about it and I remember</v>

1523
01:10:20.051 --> 01:10:22.780
<v Speaker 2>thinking just stepping back and going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>

1524
01:10:22.810 --> 01:10:27.220
<v Speaker 2>this is a new thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like people have figured out how to get</v>

1525
01:10:27.221 --> 01:10:32.221
<v Speaker 2>stuff for free online that normally it'd</v>
<v Speaker 2>be like 20 bucks or 10 bucks,</v>

1526
01:10:32.531 --> 01:10:34.690
<v Speaker 2>where the fuck it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I remember thinking,</v>

1527
01:10:34.691 --> 01:10:38.020
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a new door that just opened up.</v>

1528
01:10:38.290 --> 01:10:41.080
<v Speaker 2>I remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember like sitting back in my</v>

1529
01:10:41.081 --> 01:10:42.220
<v Speaker 2>chair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in my car,</v>

1530
01:10:42.460 --> 01:10:45.670
<v Speaker 2>I remember the fucking parking lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was going to buy dog food and I was</v>

1531
01:10:45.671 --> 01:10:47.800
<v Speaker 2>listening to this and I remember I sat</v>
<v Speaker 2>back and I went,</v>

1532
01:10:47.890 --> 01:10:49.930
<v Speaker 2>oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was a moment.</v>

1533
01:10:49.931 --> 01:10:52.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a real moment in our culture.</v>

1534
01:10:52.550 --> 01:10:53.750
<v Speaker 1>Well before then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1535
01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:56.870
<v Speaker 1>our dorms didn't even have the internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1536
01:10:56.930 --> 01:10:59.210
<v Speaker 1>You didn't have an internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You sTill had to go to the computer lab.</v>

1537
01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:01.550
<v Speaker 1>So check this out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>check this out.</v>

1538
01:11:01.580 --> 01:11:03.680
<v Speaker 1>This was the hustle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We met two white guys.</v>

1539
01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:08.150
<v Speaker 1>One guy broke his foot when he was young</v>
<v Speaker 1>and his dad gave him my old computer and</v>

1540
01:11:08.151 --> 01:11:11.300
<v Speaker 1>he started working a little car game and</v>
<v Speaker 1>from there he learned programming.</v>

1541
01:11:12.650 --> 01:11:15.120
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said we can get him access to a</v>

1542
01:11:15.121 --> 01:11:20.121
<v Speaker 1>computer lab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could supply our rooms with internet</v>

1543
01:11:20.350 --> 01:11:22.260
<v Speaker 1>because they was wired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't hooked up.</v>

1544
01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:26.380
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he can get the numbers and if and</v>

1545
01:11:26.381 --> 01:11:29.130
<v Speaker 1>statements and make the thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate with one another.</v>

1546
01:11:30.090 --> 01:11:33.030
<v Speaker 1>So a few of us in the dorms had</v>
<v Speaker 1>internet.</v>

1547
01:11:34.130 --> 01:11:35.710
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this hack the door,</v>

1548
01:11:35.750 --> 01:11:39.120
<v Speaker 1>it's like an episode of mash and this</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem with learning how to learn</v>

1549
01:11:39.121 --> 01:11:40.440
<v Speaker 1>how to hustle and survival mode.</v>

1550
01:11:40.980 --> 01:11:45.390
<v Speaker 1>You learn how to get stuff for free,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't learn how to monetIze it</v>

1551
01:11:45.391 --> 01:11:49.040
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what we did was we,</v>

1552
01:11:49.460 --> 01:11:52.380
<v Speaker 1>we started selling like cds and stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

1553
01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:54.870
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you download stuff and then sell,</v>

1554
01:11:54.930 --> 01:11:56.820
<v Speaker 1>sell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sell because nobody had laptops.</v>

1555
01:11:57.030 --> 01:12:00.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm nothing like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh wow.</v>

1556
01:12:00.450 --> 01:12:02.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A friend of mine called the crazy</v>

1557
01:12:02.581 --> 01:12:04.430
<v Speaker 1>stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to look back on this.</v>

1558
01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:06.480
<v Speaker 1>This is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those people were in the camera first</v>

1559
01:12:06.481 --> 01:12:07.620
<v Speaker 1>got invented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1560
01:12:08.210 --> 01:12:10.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We started around for four hours and he</v>

1561
01:12:10.741 --> 01:12:13.530
<v Speaker 1>painted us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know whaT I mean?</v>

1562
01:12:13.531 --> 01:12:16.350
<v Speaker 1>This is literally what that's like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what happens man.</v>

1563
01:12:16.530 --> 01:12:19.320
<v Speaker 1>And thanks to I think a year or two</v>
<v Speaker 1>earlier,</v>

1564
01:12:19.860 --> 01:12:23.340
<v Speaker 1>I was in the crack game a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were in the crack game a little bit.</v>

1565
01:12:24.030 --> 01:12:27.210
<v Speaker 1>Like 600 would be a meme.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in the crack game a little bit.</v>

1566
01:12:27.270 --> 01:12:32.270
<v Speaker 1>What this thing was new.</v>
<v Speaker 1>ThiS thing was a new hustle because more</v>

1567
01:12:32.521 --> 01:12:35.000
<v Speaker 1>people love music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1568
01:12:35.010 --> 01:12:37.730
<v Speaker 1>When did the crack game open up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was 80.</v>

1569
01:12:37.740 --> 01:12:42.440
<v Speaker 1>The eighties something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was when everything became a.</v>

1570
01:12:42.510 --> 01:12:44.160
<v Speaker 1>They blamed everything on crack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1571
01:12:44.161 --> 01:12:46.410
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They literally blamed everything on</v>

1572
01:12:46.411 --> 01:12:47.490
<v Speaker 1>crack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The epidemic.</v>

1573
01:12:47.491 --> 01:12:49.410
<v Speaker 1>like all white people are terrified to</v>
<v Speaker 1>crack.</v>

1574
01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:51.780
<v Speaker 1>They thought that for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>

1575
01:12:51.781 --> 01:12:55.170
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to match that brand?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you're lookIng at it.</v>

1576
01:12:55.850 --> 01:12:58.760
<v Speaker 1>Oh wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like the top off of it.</v>

1577
01:12:58.810 --> 01:13:00.270
<v Speaker 1>Put in your drink,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll get smArter.</v>

1578
01:13:00.670 --> 01:13:02.670
<v Speaker 1>It um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it affected me in the nineties,</v>

1579
01:13:02.700 --> 01:13:04.250
<v Speaker 1>mid nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How so?</v>

1580
01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:09.430
<v Speaker 1>With my father and my aunt</v>
<v Speaker 1>to see,</v>

1581
01:13:09.930 --> 01:13:13.350
<v Speaker 1>see a deterioration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deterioration of people</v>

1582
01:13:15.490 --> 01:13:17.520
<v Speaker 1>and families,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like full on</v>

1583
01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:22.140
<v Speaker 1>somebody you look up to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just,</v>

1584
01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:25.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a,</v>

1585
01:13:26.430 --> 01:13:28.680
<v Speaker 1>it was a way for people to get coke way</v>
<v Speaker 1>easier.</v>

1586
01:13:28.950 --> 01:13:29.783
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1587
01:13:30.090 --> 01:13:33.710
<v Speaker 1>That's basically what it is at the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>high for it or the amount of for</v>

1588
01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:34.531
<v Speaker 1>cheaper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

1589
01:13:34.531 --> 01:13:35.400
<v Speaker 1>Five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>$10,</v>

1590
01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:38.280
<v Speaker 1>but it has a different effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It must have some sort of a different</v>

1591
01:13:38.281 --> 01:13:40.140
<v Speaker 1>effect because people said that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>crack thing,</v>

1592
01:13:40.380 --> 01:13:43.680
<v Speaker 1>like after you do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like really good in the beginning</v>

1593
01:13:43.710 --> 01:13:46.590
<v Speaker 1>and then it's not so good after awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at the same with coke,</v>

1594
01:13:46.830 --> 01:13:51.830
<v Speaker 1>I think you still chasing that happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever know say yet though?</v>

1595
01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:55.620
<v Speaker 1>Leaving the possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Open bowers ready to party,</v>

1596
01:13:55.980 --> 01:13:57.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything I've done,</v>

1597
01:13:57.121 --> 01:14:02.121
<v Speaker 1>I do it for experiment with it and to</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand addiction and learn like</v>

1598
01:14:04.681 --> 01:14:09.681
<v Speaker 1>comedy makes me so happy that I don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to lean on anything for any</v>

1599
01:14:09.951 --> 01:14:12.850
<v Speaker 1>emotional thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when I do it it's just to see what</v>

1600
01:14:12.851 --> 01:14:14.210
<v Speaker 1>it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1601
01:14:14.590 --> 01:14:17.440
<v Speaker 1>So like when I did shrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1602
01:14:17.441 --> 01:14:20.680
<v Speaker 1>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was there documenting the experience</v>

1603
01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:25.360
<v Speaker 1>and then I will go back into it and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can go out being self aware mentally.</v>

1604
01:14:26.110 --> 01:14:28.660
<v Speaker 2>Almost like from an engineering</v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>

1605
01:14:28.661 --> 01:14:33.250
<v Speaker 2>we trYing to back engineer what's going</v>
<v Speaker 2>on during these drugs to try to figure</v>

1606
01:14:33.251 --> 01:14:34.370
<v Speaker 2>it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me write this stuff down.</v>

1607
01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:37.000
<v Speaker 2>Then I'll go back and look at it and try</v>
<v Speaker 2>to figure out how I got there.</v>

1608
01:14:37.130 --> 01:14:39.310
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even when I got into business,</v>

1609
01:14:39.311 --> 01:14:41.500
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's see what makes you so powerful.</v>

1610
01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:44.140
<v Speaker 2>I remember having it in my hand like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let'S see what makes you so powerful.</v>

1611
01:14:44.650 --> 01:14:45.970
<v Speaker 2>You were sayIng that to the crack</v>
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>

1612
01:14:46.690 --> 01:14:48.220
<v Speaker 2>What did it say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh sure.</v>

1613
01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:49.360
<v Speaker 2>You basically,</v>

1614
01:14:52.220 --> 01:14:54.080
<v Speaker 1>when it ended,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was the low?</v>

1615
01:14:54.081 --> 01:14:56.780
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I stopped selling the low,</v>

1616
01:14:56.940 --> 01:15:00.950
<v Speaker 1>it was a low for me because I didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know that the person who sells it is</v>

1617
01:15:00.951 --> 01:15:05.750
<v Speaker 1>addicted just as much as the user</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're addicted to selling it.</v>

1618
01:15:06.050 --> 01:15:07.430
<v Speaker 1>The power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the money.</v>

1619
01:15:08.330 --> 01:15:12.010
<v Speaker 1>When you walk in a building and people</v>
<v Speaker 1>know who you are and people you can use</v>

1620
01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:14.480
<v Speaker 1>the control you have over people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1621
01:15:14.481 --> 01:15:14.990
<v Speaker 1>this will wipe</v>

1622
01:15:14.990 --> 01:15:16.010
<v Speaker 2>power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Feels like</v>

1623
01:15:19.730 --> 01:15:22.230
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a guy who ran into a store,</v>

1624
01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:28.400
<v Speaker 1>got some clothes and brought it back</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he dIdn't have any money.</v>

1625
01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:32.060
<v Speaker 1>That's a powerful thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1626
01:15:32.690 --> 01:15:33.780
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1627
01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:36.940
<v Speaker 1>People are sucking your dick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1628
01:15:37.740 --> 01:15:38.573
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that.</v>

1629
01:15:38.850 --> 01:15:41.730
<v Speaker 2>Wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How's it equate to guide getting some</v>

1630
01:15:41.731 --> 01:15:43.230
<v Speaker 2>clothes and bring them back?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

1631
01:15:43.260 --> 01:15:44.220
<v Speaker 2>How,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the power.</v>

1632
01:15:44.370 --> 01:15:45.203
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1633
01:15:45.570 --> 01:15:48.240
<v Speaker 1>because they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing they would normally do.</v>

1634
01:15:48.780 --> 01:15:51.390
<v Speaker 1>You can make somebody do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1635
01:15:52.170 --> 01:15:55.320
<v Speaker 1>So I look at it like if I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I can think like a one percent</v>

1636
01:15:55.321 --> 01:15:57.750
<v Speaker 1>because I got a business education in</v>
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>

1637
01:15:57.751 --> 01:16:01.470
<v Speaker 1>So they give you a republican mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I was in control of over society,</v>

1638
01:16:01.471 --> 01:16:04.500
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I had a group of poor people and I</v>

1639
01:16:04.510 --> 01:16:08.440
<v Speaker 1>control the resources and this happened</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the street with drugs to this drug,</v>

1640
01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:10.470
<v Speaker 1>they will get robbed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I control the resources,</v>

1641
01:16:10.471 --> 01:16:14.070
<v Speaker 1>I can allow it to go out or I can not</v>
<v Speaker 1>allow to go out.</v>

1642
01:16:14.670 --> 01:16:18.090
<v Speaker 1>I can control the price point and if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't afford it,</v>

1643
01:16:19.170 --> 01:16:20.250
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it's like,</v>

1644
01:16:20.251 --> 01:16:22.320
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's see what else you could do</v>

1645
01:16:24.460 --> 01:16:28.220
<v Speaker 2>to get this thing that you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you were getting addicted to the</v>

1646
01:16:28.250 --> 01:16:33.250
<v Speaker 2>power of controlling these people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having these people dependent upon you</v>

1647
01:16:33.510 --> 01:16:35.390
<v Speaker 2>that you would show up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you be important,</v>

1648
01:16:35.420 --> 01:16:37.850
<v Speaker 2>you'd be making money doing something</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of dangerous.</v>

1649
01:16:37.851 --> 01:16:39.080
<v Speaker 2>There's like a bunch of different things</v>
<v Speaker 2>going on,</v>

1650
01:16:39.081 --> 01:16:41.660
<v Speaker 2>but I think I did it enough to see it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't do it long enough to get</v>

1651
01:16:42.010 --> 01:16:44.230
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think probably like six months or a</v>

1652
01:16:44.231 --> 01:16:45.770
<v Speaker 2>semester to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How'd you get out of it?</v>

1653
01:16:46.250 --> 01:16:47.083
<v Speaker 2>I had the</v>

1654
01:16:47.130 --> 01:16:51.920
<v Speaker 1>one point I had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got propositioned to take control over</v>

1655
01:16:51.921 --> 01:16:55.640
<v Speaker 1>this town and it was at a point</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciously why?</v>

1656
01:16:56.080 --> 01:16:59.510
<v Speaker 1>Like I was at a private college.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lived the triple life.</v>

1657
01:16:59.511 --> 01:17:04.511
<v Speaker 1>I had basketball scholarship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had classes that I was failing.</v>

1658
01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:08.750
<v Speaker 1>It was a religious college,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had white friends and then I would go</v>

1659
01:17:08.751 --> 01:17:11.750
<v Speaker 1>to the black community and hustle at</v>
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>

1660
01:17:12.550 --> 01:17:14.420
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of stuff to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1661
01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:18.500
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at one point I was shot at,</v>

1662
01:17:18.501 --> 01:17:20.780
<v Speaker 1>I was hanging with my white friends and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't know what the fuck was going</v>

1663
01:17:20.781 --> 01:17:23.120
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got shot at with your white friends</v>

1664
01:17:23.150 --> 01:17:24.930
<v Speaker 1>because they wanted to buy weed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but guess what?</v>

1665
01:17:24.931 --> 01:17:28.160
<v Speaker 1>They had to go get weed in this other</v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

1666
01:17:28.161 --> 01:17:30.000
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1667
01:17:30.170 --> 01:17:31.220
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1668
01:17:31.290 --> 01:17:33.830
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that person allegedly,</v>

1669
01:17:33.831 --> 01:17:35.900
<v Speaker 1>his uncle worked for me.</v>

1670
01:17:36.100 --> 01:17:39.260
<v Speaker 1>this is the first allegedly of all this</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a legit,</v>

1671
01:17:39.650 --> 01:17:41.570
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1672
01:17:42.030 --> 01:17:44.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember it was a pharmaceutical</v>

1673
01:17:44.931 --> 01:17:48.110
<v Speaker 1>company in that town that made a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>money and I remember standing outside</v>

1674
01:17:48.350 --> 01:17:50.780
<v Speaker 1>face to face with it and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a setup,</v>

1675
01:17:50.781 --> 01:17:54.410
<v Speaker 1>we will never win this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the money Is right here in this</v>

1676
01:17:54.411 --> 01:17:57.640
<v Speaker 1>pharmaceutical company is illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1677
01:17:58.340 --> 01:18:02.780
<v Speaker 1>and I met a guy who was addicted to</v>
<v Speaker 1>crack and he owns a pharmaceutical</v>

1678
01:18:02.781 --> 01:18:06.530
<v Speaker 1>company and cvs bought them out for like</v>
<v Speaker 1>one point five,</v>

1679
01:18:06.531 --> 01:18:09.200
<v Speaker 1>one point $8,000,000 and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that money went,</v>

1680
01:18:09.790 --> 01:18:11.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1681
01:18:12.260 --> 01:18:15.350
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and these and these things made me be</v>

1682
01:18:15.351 --> 01:18:17.810
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the fact I was getting angry</v>

1683
01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:22.820
<v Speaker 1>because I'm feeling realized how unfair</v>
<v Speaker 1>life is because now mean black people</v>

1684
01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:26.390
<v Speaker 1>who grandparents went to college,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

1685
01:18:27.020 --> 01:18:30.440
<v Speaker 1>And during that time they will do like</v>
<v Speaker 1>brown paper bag test to see if he was</v>

1686
01:18:30.441 --> 01:18:32.390
<v Speaker 1>allowed to go to school within the black</v>
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>

1687
01:18:32.391 --> 01:18:36.080
<v Speaker 1>They will put a brown paper bag up to</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and if you were lighter than that,</v>

1688
01:18:36.890 --> 01:18:39.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could go to school and stuff.</v>

1689
01:18:39.530 --> 01:18:42.410
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who did this?</v>

1690
01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:47.000
<v Speaker 1>This was like certain hbsu bsu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>black universities and stuff like that.</v>

1691
01:18:47.450 --> 01:18:49.520
<v Speaker 1>I know they would do that just to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>into a fraternity,</v>

1692
01:18:49.550 --> 01:18:50.450
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1693
01:18:50.690 --> 01:18:51.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could research this stuff.</v>

1694
01:18:52.310 --> 01:18:56.190
<v Speaker 1>A brown paper bag is so white.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you're telling me,</v>

1695
01:18:56.210 --> 01:18:57.043
<v Speaker 1>look at me.</v>

1696
01:18:59.590 --> 01:19:00.890
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1697
01:19:00.891 --> 01:19:05.420
<v Speaker 1>so the anger started to come and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>you In the streets hustling.</v>

1698
01:19:05.421 --> 01:19:07.940
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think I had the mentality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It got to one part.</v>

1699
01:19:07.941 --> 01:19:10.610
<v Speaker 1>I knew that if I crossed the line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lIke if I woulda hurt,</v>

1700
01:19:10.611 --> 01:19:14.150
<v Speaker 1>harm somebody in a very bad way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no coming back from that.</v>

1701
01:19:14.460 --> 01:19:16.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I was ready to make that</v>
<v Speaker 1>decision.</v>

1702
01:19:17.180 --> 01:19:19.520
<v Speaker 1>But I do know the guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I left,</v>

1703
01:19:20.060 --> 01:19:23.040
<v Speaker 1>he went on to build that part of town</v>
<v Speaker 1>and finished.</v>

1704
01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:27.470
<v Speaker 1>It was just two of us at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it became a a crew of six and each</v>

1705
01:19:27.620 --> 01:19:30.260
<v Speaker 1>made 13,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five a week.</v>

1706
01:19:30.290 --> 01:19:33.530
<v Speaker 1>Take home mom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the time they hit five,</v>

1707
01:19:33.531 --> 01:19:36.530
<v Speaker 1>six or seven years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But by the time I linked back up wIth</v>

1708
01:19:36.531 --> 01:19:40.790
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was the only one left alive,</v>

1709
01:19:40.970 --> 01:19:45.970
<v Speaker 1>alive or not in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And no religion saved them reAlly.</v>

1710
01:19:46.850 --> 01:19:49.400
<v Speaker 1>So he pulled it out because religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest of them are gone.</v>

1711
01:19:49.670 --> 01:19:52.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I just saw the way my mind works.</v>

1712
01:19:52.491 --> 01:19:54.190
<v Speaker 1>I just saw stuff early.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1713
01:19:54.200 --> 01:19:56.600
<v Speaker 1>you just put the pieces together early.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1714
01:19:56.630 --> 01:19:59.720
<v Speaker 1>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a skill I just killed a lot of</v>

1715
01:19:59.721 --> 01:20:02.510
<v Speaker 1>people who have to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you learn about watching either you</v>

1716
01:20:02.540 --> 01:20:05.660
<v Speaker 1>do your own fuck ups or you watch a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of people fuck up around you.</v>

1717
01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:08.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you talked to the children</v>

1718
01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:09.840
<v Speaker 4>of alcoholics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they rarely drink.</v>

1719
01:20:10.410 --> 01:20:11.790
<v Speaker 4>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I shouldn't say rarely.</v>

1720
01:20:11.850 --> 01:20:15.630
<v Speaker 4>When I should say is I run into a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 4>people who were the children of</v>

1721
01:20:15.631 --> 01:20:19.530
<v Speaker 4>alcoholics who realize like fuck that</v>
<v Speaker 4>noise.</v>

1722
01:20:19.770 --> 01:20:24.650
<v Speaker 4>And they realized growing up with</v>
<v Speaker 4>unreliable parents fucked up and this</v>

1723
01:20:25.620 --> 01:20:30.510
<v Speaker 4>and those people like proof positive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to actually go through</v>

1724
01:20:30.780 --> 01:20:32.190
<v Speaker 4>the mistake to learn yourself,</v>

1725
01:20:32.760 --> 01:20:34.700
<v Speaker 1>but once I learned I didn't hate drug</v>
<v Speaker 1>dealers no more,</v>

1726
01:20:34.790 --> 01:20:39.790
<v Speaker 1>but until then I did because one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not my dad I out and they,</v>

1727
01:20:40.090 --> 01:20:44.300
<v Speaker 1>I heard he climbed the flagpole for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for fun because he didn't have no money.</v>

1728
01:20:45.050 --> 01:20:48.230
<v Speaker 1>But before then this was the guy that</v>
<v Speaker 1>raised me who,</v>

1729
01:20:48.770 --> 01:20:52.610
<v Speaker 1>who managed to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We live in a small bedroom apartment,</v>

1730
01:20:52.670 --> 01:20:57.670
<v Speaker 1>two bedroom apartment to him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a five bedroom house and cars and boats</v>

1731
01:20:58.970 --> 01:21:03.110
<v Speaker 1>because he was just that smart and good</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I seen it all disappeared,</v>

1732
01:21:03.111 --> 01:21:05.080
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I call it,</v>

1733
01:21:05.081 --> 01:21:07.310
<v Speaker 1>like Carol King falling or something</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

1734
01:21:08.150 --> 01:21:12.070
<v Speaker 1>So I just wanted to see like the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>parts of that and I will be in the crack</v>

1735
01:21:12.530 --> 01:21:17.090
<v Speaker 1>crack house asking people's parents</v>
<v Speaker 1>about their kids how to make kids feel</v>

1736
01:21:17.091 --> 01:21:19.250
<v Speaker 1>about this and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1737
01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:19.671
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1738
01:21:19.671 --> 01:21:20.470
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>YoU know,</v>

1739
01:21:20.470 --> 01:21:23.240
<v Speaker 1>I talk about that right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm like,</v>

1740
01:21:23.241 --> 01:21:26.210
<v Speaker 1>so even during that time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>still like gathering information and</v>

1741
01:21:26.211 --> 01:21:27.500
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1742
01:21:28.160 --> 01:21:30.770
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's most insidious about crack is</v>

1743
01:21:30.771 --> 01:21:35.450
<v Speaker 1>that affects poor neighborhoods in</v>
<v Speaker 1>general and black neighborhoods in</v>

1744
01:21:35.451 --> 01:21:37.070
<v Speaker 1>particular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like</v>

1745
01:21:37.290 --> 01:21:41.580
<v Speaker 4>that was one of the weIrder drugs</v>
<v Speaker 4>because there was cracking poor white</v>

1746
01:21:41.581 --> 01:21:44.900
<v Speaker 4>neighborhoods.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there was an area called lowell in</v>

1747
01:21:45.240 --> 01:21:49.170
<v Speaker 4>Massachusetts that had a big problem,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was crack or was it heroin?</v>

1748
01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:53.160
<v Speaker 4>But there's a lot of it was crack</v>
<v Speaker 4>neighborhoods for sure.</v>

1749
01:21:53.161 --> 01:21:55.470
<v Speaker 4>Like I know I know poor white people</v>
<v Speaker 4>that smoke crack,</v>

1750
01:21:55.920 --> 01:22:00.920
<v Speaker 4>but it seems way more prevalent in black</v>
<v Speaker 4>communities And it,</v>

1751
01:22:01.950 --> 01:22:04.170
<v Speaker 4>I always wonder like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is,</v>

1752
01:22:04.171 --> 01:22:07.050
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's the need that's being met when,</v>

1753
01:22:07.110 --> 01:22:10.110
<v Speaker 4>when a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when a drug provides a certain type of</v>

1754
01:22:10.111 --> 01:22:12.660
<v Speaker 4>sensation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what is the need that's being met</v>

1755
01:22:13.260 --> 01:22:17.580
<v Speaker 4>that is uniquely attracted to certain</v>
<v Speaker 4>neighborhoods.</v>

1756
01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:22.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that I really don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it was cheap for certain.</v>

1757
01:22:22.260 --> 01:22:25.470
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't cheap where we was doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's what made it so profitable.</v>

1758
01:22:25.710 --> 01:22:28.320
<v Speaker 4>But do you think that it's because of</v>
<v Speaker 4>all these pressures that you were</v>

1759
01:22:28.321 --> 01:22:29.430
<v Speaker 4>talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you're,</v>

1760
01:22:29.431 --> 01:22:33.210
<v Speaker 4>you're talking about this despair.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He talking about how it just feels like</v>

1761
01:22:33.211 --> 01:22:36.660
<v Speaker 4>you can't get out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're stuck in this bad place with all</v>

1762
01:22:36.661 --> 01:22:41.661
<v Speaker 4>this danger and violence and just the</v>
<v Speaker 4>constant fucking pressure of that.</v>

1763
01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:42.170
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1764
01:22:42.170 --> 01:22:44.890
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I look at what my dad,</v>

1765
01:22:44.900 --> 01:22:47.030
<v Speaker 1>the type of people they are personality</v>
<v Speaker 1>wise,</v>

1766
01:22:47.031 --> 01:22:50.600
<v Speaker 1>very friendly and then being in a bible</v>
<v Speaker 1>belt where you're taught to behave a</v>

1767
01:22:50.601 --> 01:22:54.870
<v Speaker 1>certain way but they are real like horny</v>
<v Speaker 1>people and they like the fuck.</v>

1768
01:22:55.940 --> 01:22:56.870
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1769

1770
01:22:57.891 --> 01:23:02.891
<v Speaker 1>So I'm just Being confined,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1771
01:23:03.050 --> 01:23:05.170
<v Speaker 1>growing up with two parents.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I see people came up a certain way with</v>

1779
01:23:27.161 --> 01:23:28.480
<v Speaker 1>certain values.</v>

1780

<v Speaker 1>a problem and then you got proven.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And I'm in there</v>

1834
01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:06.780
<v Speaker 2>just lit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1835
01:26:06.790 --> 01:26:08.690
<v Speaker 2>oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just choosing my hanging out my</v>

1836
01:26:08.691 --> 01:26:09.860
<v Speaker 2>mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't even spit.</v>

1837
01:26:09.861 --> 01:26:11.990
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is the feeling of doing chewing</v>

1838
01:26:11.991 --> 01:26:15.890
<v Speaker 2>tobacco when you don't do it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was duty in that group?</v>

1839
01:26:16.030 --> 01:26:19.280
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's like I'm the equivalent to</v>

1840
01:26:19.281 --> 01:26:20.114
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1841
01:26:20.190 --> 01:26:23.960
<v Speaker 2>You just get like a weird buzz feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you just really like your eyes are</v>

1842
01:26:23.961 --> 01:26:28.610
<v Speaker 2>red and they say it's really good to</v>
<v Speaker 2>write on the nicotine is one of the best</v>

1843
01:26:28.611 --> 01:26:29.820
<v Speaker 2>things to write on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1844
01:26:29.830 --> 01:26:32.330
<v Speaker 2>it's like a more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like an alertness alert.</v>

1845
01:26:32.570 --> 01:26:34.790
<v Speaker 2>Like if I eat chocolate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drink coffee,</v>

1846
01:26:34.791 --> 01:26:37.250
<v Speaker 2>like my heart exploded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just started doing this,</v>

1847
01:26:37.610 --> 01:26:40.760
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like an alert version of that.</v>

1848
01:26:40.761 --> 01:26:43.340
<v Speaker 2>But you still like happy and stuff at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same time,</v>

1849
01:26:43.341 --> 01:26:45.710
<v Speaker 2>like as if you're on alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like you buzzed in A way.</v>

1850
01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:48.140
<v Speaker 2>So it's better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>better than,</v>

1851
01:26:48.200 --> 01:26:50.220
<v Speaker 2>than coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1852
01:26:50.270 --> 01:26:54.050
<v Speaker 2>it's more of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a drunk feeling in coffee,</v>

1853
01:26:54.320 --> 01:26:57.770
<v Speaker 2>huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>To me from chewing tobacco.</v>

1854
01:26:58.090 --> 01:27:00.890
<v Speaker 2>This is what kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is just like the loose leaf stuff</v>

1855
01:27:00.891 --> 01:27:05.290
<v Speaker 2>or stuff that you will know when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>watch them do it and then you.</v>

1856
01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:08.850
<v Speaker 2>And then you got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't even know how to spit and you</v>

1857
01:27:09.170 --> 01:27:10.003
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>

1858
01:27:11.410 --> 01:27:13.970
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I saw this one fucking dude,</v>

1859
01:27:14.100 --> 01:27:15.860
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was doing public service</v>

1860
01:27:15.861 --> 01:27:19.360
<v Speaker 2>announcements,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's going to colleges and high schools</v>

1861
01:27:19.370 --> 01:27:20.870
<v Speaker 2>rather,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and grammar schools.</v>

1862
01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:24.200
<v Speaker 2>And he was missing most of his lower</v>
<v Speaker 2>jaw.</v>

1863
01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:28.070
<v Speaker 2>He got jaw cancer from doing chewing</v>
<v Speaker 2>tobacco.</v>

1864
01:27:28.510 --> 01:27:32.150
<v Speaker 2>I think he was a baseball player.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He used to be this strapping handsome</v>

1865
01:27:32.151 --> 01:27:35.570
<v Speaker 2>gentleman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then as time went on the cancer,</v>

1866
01:27:35.571 --> 01:27:36.460
<v Speaker 2>eight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his jaw,</v>

1869
01:27:42.690 --> 01:27:45.140
<v Speaker 2>stealing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't know how to do it</v>

<v Speaker 2>How many people actually get cancer from</v>
<v Speaker 2>that stuff?</v>

1872
01:27:49.370 --> 01:27:50.203

<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1873
01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:52.640
<v Speaker 2>It seems like there's a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that do that stuff,</v>

1874
01:27:52.641 --> 01:27:54.770
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't got no electronic version</v>

1875
01:27:54.771 --> 01:27:55.730
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got.</v>

1876
01:27:56.700 --> 01:27:57.081
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1877
01:27:57.081 --> 01:27:57.650
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1878
01:27:57.650 --> 01:28:00.470
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I apparently,</v>

1879
01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:02.120
<v Speaker 2>according to people that smoke</v>
<v Speaker 2>cigarettes,</v>

1880
01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:04.640
<v Speaker 2>e-cigarettes just don't give you the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same rush.</v>

1881
01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:10.460
<v Speaker 2>They don't believe that they don't give</v>
<v Speaker 2>you thAt kick like a at the end of the</v>

1882
01:28:10.460 --> 01:28:12.170
<v Speaker 2>day to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's still smoke going inside your</v>

1883
01:28:12.171 --> 01:28:13.460
<v Speaker 2>lungs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1884
01:28:13.550 --> 01:28:17.090
<v Speaker 2>it's still smoke on of lungs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not those e-cigarettes or</v>

1885
01:28:17.091 --> 01:28:20.540
<v Speaker 2>vapor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's actually a liquid tobacco.</v>

1886
01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:26.540
<v Speaker 2>It vaporizes the liquid tobacco in some</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of particles have to be in the air,</v>

1887
01:28:27.260 --> 01:28:29.840
<v Speaker 2>but it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's attached to vapor to different</v>

1888
01:28:29.841 --> 01:28:31.760
<v Speaker 2>experience than the coal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1889
01:28:31.810 --> 01:28:36.810
<v Speaker 2>the hot smoke from fire that was caused</v>
<v Speaker 2>that burn with hydrogen or something</v>

1890
01:28:37.970 --> 01:28:41.250
<v Speaker 2>that you've ever raised in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hydrogen turns into air.</v>

1891
01:28:42.060 --> 01:28:43.320
<v Speaker 2>You burn it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1892
01:28:44.190 --> 01:28:46.190
<v Speaker 2>or is it turned the water?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some water,</v>

1893
01:28:46.200 --> 01:28:48.410
<v Speaker 2>oxygen or water?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some hydrogen burning.</v>

1894
01:28:48.860 --> 01:28:52.500
<v Speaker 2>Burning hydrogen turned the oxygen or</v>
<v Speaker 2>does it turn the water?</v>

1895
01:28:53.980 --> 01:28:56.330
<v Speaker 2>The water comes out of jamie and google</v>
<v Speaker 2>five things at the time.</v>

1896
01:28:56.331 --> 01:28:58.430

1902
01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:11.010

<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you do?</v>

1958
01:31:21.451 --> 01:31:23.010
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talked to people for a living and he</v>

1959
01:31:23.011 --> 01:31:23.844
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's all.</v>

1960
01:31:23.910 --> 01:31:24.743
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1961
01:31:25.810 --> 01:31:29.250
<v Speaker 2>well you gotta write some shit down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to fIgure out what's funny about</v>

1962
01:31:29.251 --> 01:31:31.950
<v Speaker 2>what you're about to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a little more complicated than</v>

1963
01:31:31.951 --> 01:31:32.880
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

1964
01:31:32.881 --> 01:31:34.830
<v Speaker 2>at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's all it is.</v>

1965
01:31:34.890 --> 01:31:36.330
<v Speaker 2>I call it communication.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all.</v>

1966
01:31:36.350 --> 01:31:37.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1967
01:31:37.520 --> 01:31:41.700
<v Speaker 2>at this level a level that it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting now because I'm in a weird</v>

1968
01:31:41.701 --> 01:31:46.701
<v Speaker 2>space with far as stand up weird space</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me how so far as to show business.</v>

1969
01:31:48.570 --> 01:31:51.330
<v Speaker 2>So that's a show business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How so?</v>

1970
01:31:51.630 --> 01:31:56.630
<v Speaker 2>Because there's a place in show business</v>
<v Speaker 2>where art meets the business part.</v>

1971
01:31:58.620 --> 01:31:59.720
<v Speaker 2>You know what I [inaudible]</v>

1972
01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:05.040
<v Speaker 1>and that's when it gets interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when the fight begins of like,</v>

1973
01:32:06.370 --> 01:32:07.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1974
01:32:09.300 --> 01:32:10.870
<v Speaker 1>do uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what platforms can I,</v>

1975
01:32:10.930 --> 01:32:14.500
<v Speaker 1>can this be allowed on or okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to put me on the show at</v>

1976
01:32:14.501 --> 01:32:16.260
<v Speaker 1>five people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I waNt to do a show.</v>

1977
01:32:16.280 --> 01:32:19.030
<v Speaker 1>It's just myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1978
01:32:19.031 --> 01:32:21.940
<v Speaker 1>and those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or you got agents now you ask them to</v>

1979
01:32:21.941 --> 01:32:24.220
<v Speaker 1>book you and then you don't hear from</v>
<v Speaker 1>them for five months,</v>

1980
01:32:25.180 --> 01:32:28.780
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was the weird part of just</v>

1981
01:32:28.781 --> 01:32:30.580
<v Speaker 1>learning that part of show business.</v>

1982
01:32:30.760 --> 01:32:33.300
<v Speaker 4>navigating the waters of sharks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1983
01:32:33.370 --> 01:32:35.910
<v Speaker 4>It's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>daniel tosh and I were at the improv.</v>

1984
01:32:35.950 --> 01:32:39.610
<v Speaker 4>NaMedrop watch me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're at the improv the other night and</v>

1985
01:32:40.150 --> 01:32:43.990
<v Speaker 4>there was this one dude who was a</v>
<v Speaker 4>manager is kind of shifty character and</v>

1986
01:32:44.170 --> 01:32:47.560
<v Speaker 4>daniel came over and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that guy gives me the creeps and I tell</v>

1987
01:32:47.561 --> 01:32:48.071
<v Speaker 4>him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

1988
01:32:48.071 --> 01:32:49.420
<v Speaker 4>you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That guy said to me once,</v>

1989
01:32:49.720 --> 01:32:51.910
<v Speaker 4>he said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're the one that got away.</v>

1990
01:32:52.240 --> 01:32:53.980
<v Speaker 4>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

1991
01:32:53.981 --> 01:32:58.360
<v Speaker 4>he said the same fucking thing to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then tosh even tweeted it to me</v>

1992
01:33:00.400 --> 01:33:01.910
<v Speaker 4>with a bunch of passes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At the eNd of it,</v>

1993
01:33:04.330 --> 01:33:07.180
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's gonna be those guys.</v>

1994
01:33:07.270 --> 01:33:09.700
<v Speaker 4>But if you find someone that's good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1995
01:33:09.701 --> 01:33:12.370
<v Speaker 4>you develop a good relationship with a</v>
<v Speaker 4>good agent and a good manager.</v>

1996
01:33:12.400 --> 01:33:13.720
<v Speaker 4>It's like everything else,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1997
01:33:13.870 --> 01:33:17.140
<v Speaker 4>You can come to hollywood and meet a</v>
<v Speaker 4>bunch of crazy actors or you can meet a</v>

1998
01:33:17.141 --> 01:33:18.070
<v Speaker 4>bunch of artists.</v>

1999
01:33:18.370 --> 01:33:19.990
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can meet a bunch of people that are</v>

2000
01:33:19.991 --> 01:33:22.060

<v Speaker 4>Energy is bad anymore.</v>

2014
01:33:48.150 --> 01:33:49.190
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

01:33:53.800 --> 01:33:56.800
<v Speaker 4>it's a different place for sure than</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's ever been before.</v>

2017
01:33:56.830 --> 01:33:58.810
<v Speaker 4>But there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no bad energy at the comedy</v>

2018
01:33:58.811 --> 01:34:00.820
<v Speaker 4>store.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a goddamn hug fest.</v>

2020
01:34:01.570 --> 01:34:02.400
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2021
01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:04.640
<v Speaker 1>I felt a little something when I first</v>
<v Speaker 1>went there.</v>

2022
01:34:05.030 --> 01:34:07.280
<v Speaker 1>That's probably what brought me to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>store honestly.</v>

2023
01:34:07.950 --> 01:34:11.300
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I started in the urban rooms and</v>

2024
01:34:11.301 --> 01:34:13.130
<v Speaker 1>they didn't want to book me because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was too far.</v>

2025
01:34:13.190 --> 01:34:14.960
<v Speaker 1>It was too experimental,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my style.</v>

2026
01:34:16.040 --> 01:34:18.800
<v Speaker 1>So I was like gonna try to get into</v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy store.</v>

2027
01:34:19.370 --> 01:34:21.290
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I broke in the club before I know how</v>

2028
01:34:22.070 --> 01:34:24.050
<v Speaker 1>tough it is or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

2029
01:34:24.100 --> 01:34:25.190
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't go there.</v>

2030
01:34:25.340 --> 01:34:27.440
<v Speaker 1>They don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't let black comics and they</v>

2031
01:34:27.470 --> 01:34:29.330
<v Speaker 1>racist and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they racist.</v>

2032
01:34:29.960 --> 01:34:30.531
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2033
01:34:30.531 --> 01:34:32.570
<v Speaker 1>I've been dealing with racism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's easy.</v>

2034
01:34:32.571 --> 01:34:35.240
<v Speaker 1>That's a mental thing and that's what I</v>
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>

2035
01:34:35.880 --> 01:34:37.400
<v Speaker 1>What do you think the comedy store was?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Racist.</v>

2036
01:34:37.401 --> 01:34:38.900
<v Speaker 1>That's what I heard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who said that?</v>

2037
01:34:39.520 --> 01:34:41.480
<v Speaker 1>Like a lot of black comments were saying</v>
<v Speaker 1>that when I got here,</v>

2038
01:34:41.690 --> 01:34:43.730
<v Speaker 1>I bet they weren't that funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2039
01:34:43.731 --> 01:34:44.680
<v Speaker 1>it's different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2040
01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:48.830
<v Speaker 1>it's a different style.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First off and a racism is mental.</v>

2041
01:34:49.740 --> 01:34:50.573
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2042
01:34:50.870 --> 01:34:53.750
<v Speaker 1>to me hollywood is racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go in a room and be like too light,</v>

2043
01:34:53.751 --> 01:34:54.620
<v Speaker 1>too dark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>too tall,</v>

2044
01:34:54.621 --> 01:34:55.580
<v Speaker 1>too short,</v>
<v Speaker 1>too fat,</v>

2045
01:34:55.820 --> 01:34:57.320
<v Speaker 1>but then it's sexist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's</v>

2046
01:34:58.570 --> 01:34:59.570
<v Speaker 2>just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then it's,</v>

2047
01:35:00.050 --> 01:35:04.220
<v Speaker 2>it's a sizes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like they don't like fat people.</v>

2048
01:35:04.221 --> 01:35:07.730
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of things at hollywood is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's because they're trying to fill</v>

2049
01:35:07.731 --> 01:35:10.130
<v Speaker 2>apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have an idea in their head and what</v>

2050
01:35:10.131 --> 01:35:12.320
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be and not live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You let that get to you.</v>

2051
01:35:13.210 --> 01:35:14.730
<v Speaker 2>I had went through so much mentally</v>
<v Speaker 2>they.</v>

2052
01:35:14.740 --> 01:35:16.070
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that ain't going to stop.</v>

2053
01:35:16.290 --> 01:35:18.290
<v Speaker 2>That's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah.</v>

2054
01:35:18.291 --> 01:35:21.290
<v Speaker 2>But still they were racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were still in higher you like it's</v>

2055
01:35:21.291 --> 01:35:26.291
<v Speaker 2>not the comedy store is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is they get a lot of pressure to be more</v>

2056
01:35:27.770 --> 01:35:29.120
<v Speaker 2>this more diverse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more.</v>

2057
01:35:29.121 --> 01:35:31.340
<v Speaker 2>I know I've seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've talked to them about it.</v>

2058
01:35:31.341 --> 01:35:33.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well they tried to do is just book the</v>

2059
01:35:33.351 --> 01:35:35.510
<v Speaker 2>funniest people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what they always try to do.</v>

2060
01:35:35.810 --> 01:35:38.420
<v Speaker 2>Just before the guy was booking it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking crazy,</v>

2061
01:35:39.500 --> 01:35:41.870
<v Speaker 2>but his idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he probably thought he was doing the</v>

2062
01:35:41.871 --> 01:35:42.704
<v Speaker 2>right thing.</v>

2063
01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:43.550
<v Speaker 2>He did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2064
01:35:43.550 --> 01:35:45.740
<v Speaker 2>that's how I made it through that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

2065
01:35:46.350 --> 01:35:47.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2066
01:35:47.540 --> 01:35:50.210
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so everything else was easy.</v>

2067
01:35:50.630 --> 01:35:53.960
<v Speaker 2>I sat there and listened to the talks</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you let it,</v>

2068
01:35:53.961 --> 01:35:56.750
<v Speaker 2>you can let it affect you or you can or</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can be like,</v>

2069
01:35:57.380 --> 01:36:00.090
<v Speaker 2>fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well people don't know that.</v>

2070
01:36:00.230 --> 01:36:01.910
<v Speaker 2>That stopped like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2071
01:36:01.911 --> 01:36:06.380
<v Speaker 2>like two years ago that guy stopped</v>
<v Speaker 2>working there and from then on it's</v>

2072
01:36:06.381 --> 01:36:08.390
<v Speaker 2>become a completely different</v>
<v Speaker 2>environment.</v>

2073
01:36:08.420 --> 01:36:11.270
<v Speaker 2>It's insane now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so much better and I'm glad I'm a</v>

2074
01:36:11.271 --> 01:36:15.020
<v Speaker 2>part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like as far as making the cut because</v>

2075
01:36:15.950 --> 01:36:18.620
<v Speaker 2>the talent as far what people got going</v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

2076
01:36:18.621 --> 01:36:21.920
<v Speaker 2>I still feel like a regular comic</v>
<v Speaker 2>compared to what the people that I'm on</v>

2077
01:36:21.921 --> 01:36:26.921
<v Speaker 2>stage with now and that says something</v>
<v Speaker 2>about me I've failed confidence wise,</v>

2078
01:36:28.670 --> 01:36:30.650
<v Speaker 2>but also letting me know like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2079
01:36:30.740 --> 01:36:33.350
<v Speaker 2>I gotta get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2080
01:36:33.351 --> 01:36:36.170
<v Speaker 2>whatever else I need to get done done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

2081
01:36:36.770 --> 01:36:38.840
<v Speaker 2>Like I should be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>amongst the big book,</v>

2082
01:36:38.870 --> 01:36:41.060
<v Speaker 2>I feel like it'd be a monster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big monster,</v>

2083
01:36:41.061 --> 01:36:42.860
<v Speaker 2>big boy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Monks amongst.</v>

2084
01:36:44.960 --> 01:36:48.830
<v Speaker 2>I get it because after a while you do</v>
<v Speaker 2>rooms and you're the funniest person in</v>

2085
01:36:48.831 --> 01:36:53.690
<v Speaker 2>the room and that can make you cocky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then one night somebody don't show</v>

2086
01:36:53.691 --> 01:36:57.980
<v Speaker 2>up or somebody don't want to follow joe</v>
<v Speaker 2>rogan and you have to follow joe rogan</v>

2087
01:36:58.430 --> 01:37:03.430
<v Speaker 2>and then you learn what season is on a</v>
<v Speaker 2>different level and you can't cheat your</v>

2088
01:37:06.891 --> 01:37:09.980
<v Speaker 2>way to being seasoned in anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2089
01:37:10.430 --> 01:37:12.930
<v Speaker 2>you gotta put your time in your timing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2090
01:37:13.490 --> 01:37:14.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's one of the things that comedy</v>

2091
01:37:14.810 --> 01:37:19.130
<v Speaker 2>store's always been very good at giving</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys opportunities because of the fact</v>

2092
01:37:19.131 --> 01:37:21.710
<v Speaker 2>that also there's a bunch of people on</v>
<v Speaker 2>it at night.</v>

2093
01:37:21.800 --> 01:37:22.810
<v Speaker 2>It might be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2094
01:37:23.310 --> 01:37:25.580
<v Speaker 2>people on an average lineup was like 13</v>
<v Speaker 2>or 14,</v>

2095
01:37:25.590 --> 01:37:26.600
<v Speaker 2>12,</v>
<v Speaker 2>12,</v>

2096
01:37:26.660 --> 01:37:29.870
<v Speaker 2>12,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so 12 people doing 15 minute sets and</v>

2097
01:37:29.871 --> 01:37:33.200
<v Speaker 2>the show goes on all day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're going to get some</v>

2098
01:37:33.201 --> 01:37:37.220
<v Speaker 2>opportunities if you're a young guy or</v>
<v Speaker 2>young girl to go on,</v>

2099
01:37:37.520 --> 01:37:40.040
<v Speaker 2>like right after chris delea or right</v>
<v Speaker 2>after,</v>

2100
01:37:40.130 --> 01:37:42.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a joey diaz or ron white,</v>

2101
01:37:43.180 --> 01:37:46.940
<v Speaker 2>you get a chance to see these people</v>
<v Speaker 2>take these tough spots after they just</v>

2102
01:37:46.941 --> 01:37:50.570
<v Speaker 2>watched he go on after ron white,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going on after someone.</v>

2103
01:37:50.570 --> 01:37:53.090
<v Speaker 2>These people love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They love that guy.</v>

2104
01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:55.720
<v Speaker 2>Come to see him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're excited when he's there.</v>

2105
01:37:55.940 --> 01:37:56.320
<v Speaker 2>They're</v>

2106
01:37:56.320 --> 01:37:58.110
<v Speaker 4>all googly eyed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The.</v>

2107
01:37:58.460 --> 01:38:00.930
<v Speaker 4>That was their time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a bunch.</v>

2108
01:38:01.030 --> 01:38:04.200
<v Speaker 4>If ron white's at the comedy store,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a good chance that a bunch of</v>

2109
01:38:04.201 --> 01:38:06.510
<v Speaker 4>people in the audience came there</v>
<v Speaker 4>specifically to see him.</v>

2110
01:38:06.630 --> 01:38:10.590
<v Speaker 4>So if you go on right after him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to introduce them to the world</v>

2111
01:38:10.591 --> 01:38:11.610
<v Speaker 4>of byron bowers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2112
01:38:11.840 --> 01:38:14.670
<v Speaker 4>it takes a little time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you gotta like ease them in,</v>

2113
01:38:14.671 --> 01:38:17.520
<v Speaker 4>you've got to relax them that now you</v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

2114
01:38:17.521 --> 01:38:19.500
<v Speaker 4>ron's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know that he was only here for 15</v>

2115
01:38:19.501 --> 01:38:22.020
<v Speaker 4>minutes but he's gone and now I'm going</v>
<v Speaker 4>to come up and it's,</v>

2116
01:38:22.500 --> 01:38:24.900
<v Speaker 4>it's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very unique environment in that sense</v>

2117
01:38:24.901 --> 01:38:29.901
<v Speaker 4>because it gives us a chance to also see</v>
<v Speaker 4>how other people do that and then also</v>

2118
01:38:30.661 --> 01:38:31.650
<v Speaker 4>see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2119
01:38:31.651 --> 01:38:35.640
<v Speaker 4>you're going to get the chance to see 12</v>
<v Speaker 4>different people styles if you sit there</v>

2120
01:38:35.641 --> 01:38:36.361
<v Speaker 4>the whole night.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2121
01:38:36.361 --> 01:38:39.240
<v Speaker 4>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So much difference in their style and so</v>

2122
01:38:39.270 --> 01:38:40.380
<v Speaker 4>funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So much.</v>

2123
01:38:40.381 --> 01:38:43.740
<v Speaker 4>I mean big difference between you who's</v>
<v Speaker 4>really funny and a guy like michael</v>

2124
01:38:43.741 --> 01:38:46.160
<v Speaker 4>costa who's already really funny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our,</v>

<v Speaker 4>as well all really funny.</v>

2126
01:38:49.770 --> 01:38:51.930
<v Speaker 4>But when you look at the two of you guys</v>
<v Speaker 4>together,</v>

2127
01:38:51.931 --> 01:38:56.310
<v Speaker 4>what you both have in common is that you</v>
<v Speaker 4>both have like all this really cool</v>

2128
01:38:56.311 --> 01:38:58.980
<v Speaker 4>potential and you might see that 10</v>
<v Speaker 4>times.</v>

2129
01:38:59.320 --> 01:39:01.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2130
01:39:01.290 --> 01:39:02.980

<v Speaker 1>with these guys to do theaters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will learn how to perform it in</v>

2143
01:39:28.451 --> 01:39:33.280
<v Speaker 1>front of a group of people between</v>
<v Speaker 1>220,000 by the time you mastered these</v>

2144
01:39:33.281 --> 01:39:35.590
<v Speaker 1>rooms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he to me,</v>

01:39:36.160 --> 01:39:38.580
<v Speaker 1>regardless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I listened to what people say he told to</v>

2146
01:39:38.590 --> 01:39:39.970
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't have those conversations</v>

2147
01:39:39.971 --> 01:39:40.804
<v Speaker 1>with me.</v>

2148
01:39:40.870 --> 01:39:44.290
<v Speaker 1>He just made it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just prolonged what I thought I was</v>

2149
01:39:44.291 --> 01:39:47.140
<v Speaker 1>ready for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But by the time I got to the main room</v>

2175
01:41:00.580 --> 01:41:01.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first time I did the,</v>

2176
01:41:01.761 --> 01:41:04.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the call back that got me to montreal.</v>

2177
01:41:04.990 --> 01:41:07.510
<v Speaker 1>I went up first and I didn't want to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>first,</v>

2178
01:41:07.960 --> 01:41:11.830
<v Speaker 1>but the set was so strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It affected the next three comedians</v>

2179
01:41:11.890 --> 01:41:14.980
<v Speaker 1>after me because people were just</v>
<v Speaker 1>staring at him.</v>

2180
01:41:16.180 --> 01:41:18.440
<v Speaker 1>And when you do content,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you just said,</v>

2181
01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:22.340
<v Speaker 4>but did it affect them or did they just</v>
<v Speaker 4>not be that good?</v>

2182
01:41:22.610 --> 01:41:23.100
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a,</v>

2183
01:41:23.100 --> 01:41:24.320
<v Speaker 4>that's a lot of what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2184
01:41:24.321 --> 01:41:27.340
<v Speaker 4>It's like when someone sees you kill</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the.</v>

2185
01:41:27.341 --> 01:41:29.750
<v Speaker 4>One of the big things that happened to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the beautiful things about the</v>

2186
01:41:29.751 --> 01:41:31.970
<v Speaker 4>comedy store,</v>
<v Speaker 4>about what you're talking about going on</v>

2187
01:41:31.971 --> 01:41:35.090
<v Speaker 4>after I was telling people that are</v>
<v Speaker 4>killing is you learn how to relax.</v>

2188
01:41:35.420 --> 01:41:38.840
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of what happens is when a</v>
<v Speaker 4>guy has to go on after someone that's</v>

2189
01:41:38.841 --> 01:41:41.900
<v Speaker 4>really strong is that they panic and</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they panic,</v>

2190
01:41:41.930 --> 01:41:44.960
<v Speaker 4>they can't even be themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is not as funny as that guy.</v>

2191
01:41:45.020 --> 01:41:45.853
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's true.</v>

2192
01:41:45.860 --> 01:41:48.050
<v Speaker 4>I used to feel that was a big thing that</v>
<v Speaker 4>happened to me.</v>

2193
01:41:48.051 --> 01:41:51.810
<v Speaker 4>I would always go after.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a ton of guys that are going to</v>

2194
01:41:51.811 --> 01:41:53.690
<v Speaker 4>have to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the ones who would always bomb</v>

2195
01:41:53.700 --> 01:41:54.890
<v Speaker 4>afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 4>martin lawrence,</v>

2196
01:41:55.580 --> 01:41:59.970
<v Speaker 4>he was just too good back then in two</v>
<v Speaker 4>famous and too popular and you know,</v>

2197
01:41:59.990 --> 01:42:03.950
<v Speaker 4>he would do it 45 minutes and then I</v>
<v Speaker 4>would do whatever like 15 minutes after</v>

2198
01:42:03.951 --> 01:42:05.780
<v Speaker 4>him and I always bombed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I always.</v>

2199
01:42:05.780 --> 01:42:09.440
<v Speaker 4>That was the spot that I got and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>realized like a bunch of things I would</v>

2200
01:42:09.441 --> 01:42:12.110
<v Speaker 4>see here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My own jokes come out and knew they were</v>

2201
01:42:12.111 --> 01:42:14.240
<v Speaker 4>not good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I didn't think they were good.</v>

2202
01:42:14.810 --> 01:42:19.610
<v Speaker 4>So I realized like okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've got to change pretty much</v>

2203
01:42:19.611 --> 01:42:23.300
<v Speaker 4>everything about my approach because</v>
<v Speaker 4>what I'm doing is I got comfortable.</v>

2204
01:42:23.330 --> 01:42:27.740
<v Speaker 4>I found like a little area that I could</v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of a right and performing and these</v>

2205
01:42:27.741 --> 01:42:29.360
<v Speaker 4>are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these are the jokes that I've sort of</v>

2206
01:42:29.361 --> 01:42:32.510
<v Speaker 4>got and try to work with and I didn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>try to expand enough.</v>

2207
01:42:32.870 --> 01:42:36.350
<v Speaker 4>And when you get stuck into a situation</v>
<v Speaker 4>where you have to kind of duke it out</v>

2208
01:42:36.351 --> 01:42:38.510
<v Speaker 4>for survival,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it makes you reassess.</v>

2209
01:42:38.660 --> 01:42:40.070
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why is all this bad?</v>

2210
01:42:40.071 --> 01:42:41.660
<v Speaker 4>Like what's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's going wrong?</v>

2211
01:42:41.661 --> 01:42:43.910
<v Speaker 4>Like what am I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People don't like doing that because if</v>

2212
01:42:43.911 --> 01:42:45.140
<v Speaker 4>you do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody wants to think they're a</v>

2213
01:42:45.141 --> 01:42:46.410
<v Speaker 4>finished product.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2214
01:42:46.420 --> 01:42:47.120
<v Speaker 4>That's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2215
01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:48.440
<v Speaker 4>that's the comfort zone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2216
01:42:48.680 --> 01:42:50.690
<v Speaker 4>Everybody wants to stay inside their</v>
<v Speaker 4>comfort zone.</v>

2217
01:42:50.900 --> 01:42:51.920
<v Speaker 4>This is it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm good.</v>

2218
01:42:51.921 --> 01:42:53.420
<v Speaker 4>I'm pretty happy with the way things are</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2219
01:42:53.480 --> 01:42:55.550
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you do that,</v>

2220
01:42:55.780 --> 01:42:58.610
<v Speaker 4>like it's gonna take too long.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if you really want to get,</v>

2221
01:42:58.740 --> 01:43:02.270
<v Speaker 4>you want to be like a martin lawrence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you're not going to do it by being</v>

2222
01:43:02.271 --> 01:43:03.680
<v Speaker 4>comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's not going to happen.</v>

2223
01:43:03.850 --> 01:43:06.460
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I came up to you that night.</v>

2224
01:43:06.461 --> 01:43:08.020
<v Speaker 1>I had a following and was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yo,</v>

2225
01:43:08.810 --> 01:43:11.410
<v Speaker 1>that was some heavy weights right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

2226
01:43:11.960 --> 01:43:14.170
<v Speaker 1>Off loans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just content like.</v>

2227
01:43:14.830 --> 01:43:17.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the content and life experiences</v>

2228
01:43:17.080 --> 01:43:22.080
<v Speaker 1>and sandstone learning like okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I tell these stories about my dad,</v>

2229
01:43:22.690 --> 01:43:25.750
<v Speaker 1>schizophrenia and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't even have to be the funniest.</v>

2230
01:43:25.751 --> 01:43:27.010
<v Speaker 1>They just so interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They hold.</v>

2231
01:43:27.011 --> 01:43:27.850
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2232
01:43:27.990 --> 01:43:30.460
<v Speaker 1>That if a funny guy to come up and talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>about relationships,</v>

2233
01:43:30.970 --> 01:43:32.430
<v Speaker 1>people still going to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2234
01:43:33.520 --> 01:43:36.670
<v Speaker 1>that last year was crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I start doing that,</v>

2235
01:43:37.510 --> 01:43:38.830
<v Speaker 1>people wouldn't just come up to me</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

2236
01:43:38.831 --> 01:43:40.750
<v Speaker 1>you find it more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were just like,</v>

2237
01:43:40.751 --> 01:43:41.820
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's that.</v>

2238
01:43:42.790 --> 01:43:45.710
<v Speaker 1>I know what that's like because my aunt</v>
<v Speaker 1>was paranoia,</v>

2239
01:43:45.730 --> 01:43:49.420
<v Speaker 1>schizophrenia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to me that's the universe saying hi,</v>

2240
01:43:49.540 --> 01:43:51.770
<v Speaker 1>now you're onto something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that only comes through.</v>

2241
01:43:51.790 --> 01:43:54.320
<v Speaker 1>Failed to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you've improved through failure.</v>

2242
01:43:54.860 --> 01:43:57.020
<v Speaker 1>Like the light bulb was invented through</v>
<v Speaker 1>failure,</v>

2243
01:43:57.050 --> 01:43:58.910
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not through getting it right the first</v>

2244
01:43:58.911 --> 01:44:02.630
<v Speaker 1>time to 10,000 times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that thing to get perfect.</v>

2245
01:44:02.631 --> 01:44:06.230
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think also we were thinking a big</v>

2246
01:44:06.231 --> 01:44:08.600
<v Speaker 1>part of what you just said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's important as you were talking</v>

2247
01:44:08.601 --> 01:44:11.000
<v Speaker 1>about the way it feels when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to it,</v>

2248
01:44:11.010 --> 01:44:14.600
<v Speaker 1>that it's not like your standard</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship stuff,</v>

2249
01:44:14.630 --> 01:44:18.020
<v Speaker 1>that it's something that's in some ways</v>
<v Speaker 1>more,</v>

2250
01:44:18.130 --> 01:44:19.550
<v Speaker 1>more enticing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2251
01:44:19.551 --> 01:44:22.400
<v Speaker 1>It's an interesting subject like</v>
<v Speaker 1>schizophrenia,</v>

2252
01:44:23.180 --> 01:44:25.460
<v Speaker 1>like there's something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's weight to it,</v>

2253
01:44:25.461 --> 01:44:26.294
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2254
01:44:26.390 --> 01:44:27.500
<v Speaker 1>It's honest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's honest.</v>

2255
01:44:27.890 --> 01:44:32.510
<v Speaker 1>Like my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my black lives matter stuff is honest</v>

2256
01:44:32.750 --> 01:44:35.390
<v Speaker 1>and is not going to get me liked by</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

2257
01:44:35.850 --> 01:44:38.060
<v Speaker 1>but it's how I feel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

2258
01:44:38.930 --> 01:44:39.840
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2259
01:44:40.410 --> 01:44:41.720
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's to even,</v>

2260
01:44:41.721 --> 01:44:44.180
<v Speaker 1>to me it's a little messed up how I feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the situation,</v>

2261
01:44:44.600 --> 01:44:47.360
<v Speaker 1>but it's honest at the moment how I feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>about this.</v>

2262
01:44:47.610 --> 01:44:49.430
<v Speaker 1>How do you feel about it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll talk about it.</v>

2263
01:44:49.460 --> 01:44:50.600
<v Speaker 1>Well I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to me,</v>

2264
01:44:50.601 --> 01:44:55.601
<v Speaker 1>not that it's the worst part of me about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the video is that he got shot in front</v>

2265
01:44:55.851 --> 01:44:59.630
<v Speaker 1>of a toyota camry and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how shallow I am.</v>

2266
01:44:59.720 --> 01:45:02.480
<v Speaker 1>If it was me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would've found a bands or something to</v>

2267
01:45:02.481 --> 01:45:06.290
<v Speaker 1>crawl near just because I know it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna look good because I'm about to go</v>

2268
01:45:06.291 --> 01:45:07.490
<v Speaker 1>viral,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2269
01:45:07.580 --> 01:45:10.700
<v Speaker 1>And I want to look good before I get</v>
<v Speaker 1>turned into a hashtag because that's</v>

2270
01:45:10.701 --> 01:45:13.460
<v Speaker 1>what the police are doing is turning</v>
<v Speaker 1>niggers in the hashtags.</v>

2271
01:45:14.390 --> 01:45:16.220
<v Speaker 1>And I turned to somebody look white.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2272
01:45:16.221 --> 01:45:17.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the average lifespan for a young black</v>

2273
01:45:17.931 --> 01:45:18.890
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>25,</v>

2274
01:45:19.210 --> 01:45:23.090
<v Speaker 1>but hashtags live forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's the thing about fear,</v>

2275
01:45:23.100 --> 01:45:25.400
<v Speaker 1>death and shallowness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>

2276
01:45:25.401 --> 01:45:28.250
<v Speaker 1>that's the complexity of my bits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I have to admit,</v>

2277
01:45:28.520 --> 01:45:30.960
<v Speaker 1>and that's a true how I really felt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2278
01:45:30.970 --> 01:45:32.540
<v Speaker 1>when even when he hit the car and I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2279
01:45:32.570 --> 01:45:34.310
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the car was bouncing.</v>

2280
01:45:34.310 --> 01:45:35.720
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at the suspension on that.</v>

2281
01:45:36.980 --> 01:45:38.630
<v Speaker 1>But that's what makes it funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people,</v>

2282
01:45:38.631 --> 01:45:40.400
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what makes it fun of the people.</v>

2283
01:45:40.580 --> 01:45:42.340
<v Speaker 1>But I have to learn to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2284
01:45:42.350 --> 01:45:45.920
<v Speaker 1>as artists we learned and you do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you learn to let go of those things.</v>

2285
01:45:46.220 --> 01:45:50.900
<v Speaker 1>But the more work I don't get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more honest I would come because you</v>

2286
01:45:50.901 --> 01:45:53.450
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you stop trying to fit in and you don't</v>

2287
01:45:53.451 --> 01:45:55.490
<v Speaker 1>care if they're trying to book a nice</v>
<v Speaker 1>black guy no more.</v>

2288
01:45:56.480 --> 01:45:58.190
<v Speaker 1>You get paid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you take another jacket off,</v>

2289
01:45:58.191 --> 01:46:00.530
<v Speaker 1>you take another shirt off to you just</v>
<v Speaker 1>dealt with no shirt on.</v>

2290
01:46:01.600 --> 01:46:02.031
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2291
01:46:02.031 --> 01:46:03.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm in my thirties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got wrinkles right here now.</v>

2292
01:46:05.010 --> 01:46:08.600
<v Speaker 1>But I never got laid more in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2293
01:46:08.790 --> 01:46:10.170
<v Speaker 1>like he's just honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2294
01:46:10.270 --> 01:46:12.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's something relieving.</v>

2295
01:46:12.981 --> 01:46:17.981
<v Speaker 1>It's something whatever from a kid who</v>
<v Speaker 1>was quiet growing up and held everything</v>

2296
01:46:18.561 --> 01:46:22.130
<v Speaker 1>in such a release into being able to put</v>
<v Speaker 1>this stuff out.</v>

2297
01:46:23.030 --> 01:46:25.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's probably something a lot of</v>

2298
01:46:25.101 --> 01:46:27.500
<v Speaker 1>people don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2299
01:46:28.020 --> 01:46:29.520
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people don't understand that</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

2300
01:46:29.570 --> 01:46:32.600
<v Speaker 1>Where you're coming from is not just</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you are now,</v>

2301
01:46:32.780 --> 01:46:35.740
<v Speaker 1>but it's where you started out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2302
01:46:36.710 --> 01:46:37.820
<v Speaker 1>And you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2303
01:46:37.821 --> 01:46:40.490
<v Speaker 1>you're taking particular joy in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom.</v>

2304
01:46:40.790 --> 01:46:44.270
<v Speaker 1>It's particularly unusual the way you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>expressing yourself.</v>

2305
01:46:44.810 --> 01:46:45.643
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's.</v>

2306
01:46:45.660 --> 01:46:47.070
<v Speaker 1>And as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as being volunteers,</v>

2307
01:46:47.071 --> 01:46:48.830
<v Speaker 1>that vulnerability that people talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

2308
01:46:49.800 --> 01:46:50.010
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

2309
01:46:50.010 --> 01:46:52.050
<v Speaker 2>as you grow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I grow as a person,</v>

2310
01:46:52.560 --> 01:46:54.360
<v Speaker 2>my comedy has grown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2311
01:46:54.370 --> 01:46:55.740
<v Speaker 2>That's got to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't,</v>

2312
01:46:55.800 --> 01:46:57.780
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read something in the day on jen</v>

<v Speaker 2>kirkman and there was talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was talking about the comedy is one</v>

2314
01:47:02.671 --> 01:47:06.090
<v Speaker 2>of those things you actually do get</v>
<v Speaker 2>better at when you get older and it's</v>

2315
01:47:06.091 --> 01:47:08.520
<v Speaker 2>one of those things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a rare thing for women to,</v>

2316
01:47:08.550 --> 01:47:12.450
<v Speaker 2>that they're still at like a 40 year old</v>
<v Speaker 2>woman,</v>

2317
01:47:12.600 --> 01:47:14.670
<v Speaker 2>doesn't have a lot of opportunity as an</v>
<v Speaker 2>actress,</v>

2318
01:47:14.940 --> 01:47:17.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of play some mom rolls and stuff</v>

2319
01:47:17.251 --> 01:47:19.830
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But as far as like to lead something but</v>

2320
01:47:19.831 --> 01:47:23.020
<v Speaker 2>a 40 year old comic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a lot of them are just kinda</v>

2321
01:47:23.040 --> 01:47:24.600
<v Speaker 2>getting started.</v>
<v Speaker 2>True.</v>

2322
01:47:24.750 --> 01:47:26.670
<v Speaker 2>Look at sarah silverman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's better now than ever.</v>

<v Speaker 2>what is she like 46 or something like</v>

<v Speaker 2>it just grows on,</v>

2327
01:47:36.490 --> 01:47:38.310
<v Speaker 2>its not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not the way you look,</v>

2328
01:47:38.420 --> 01:47:41.380
<v Speaker 2>the way you carry yourself and the way</v>
<v Speaker 2>you move when you talk to.</v>

2329

<v Speaker 2>You're trying to say your fan out the</v>
<v Speaker 2>bat signal before.</v>

<v Speaker 2>winters and he seems to come without any</v>

2401
01:51:07.541 --> 01:51:10.600
<v Speaker 2>of the baggage the most super winters</v>
<v Speaker 2>come with.</v>

2402
01:51:11.320 --> 01:51:13.210
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of baggage that most,</v>

2403
01:51:13.240 --> 01:51:18.240

<v Speaker 2>He's like a god damn alien.</v>

<v Speaker 2>That guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was weird because I had tickets talk</v>

<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like they said,</v>

<v Speaker 2>they nurse,</v>

2411
01:51:35.800 --> 01:51:39.310

<v Speaker 2>So they act like that when you see them</v>

<v Speaker 2>Kissing all on the neck and acting like</v>

2414
01:51:43.390 --> 01:51:45.580
<v Speaker 2>the guys we used to beat them up the</v>
<v Speaker 2>job,</v>

2415
01:51:45.840 --> 01:51:47.290
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get bullied.</v>

2416
01:51:47.320 --> 01:51:49.470
<v Speaker 2>But if you look at the warren buffetts</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>

2417
01:51:49.870 --> 01:51:52.450
<v Speaker 2>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bill gates and the guys was just like,</v>

2419
01:51:54.300 --> 01:51:58.360

<v Speaker 2>but it's a new day now.</v>

2420
01:51:58.740 --> 01:52:00.580
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>warren buffet still lives in the same</v>

2421
01:52:00.581 --> 01:52:01.780
<v Speaker 2>fucking house in omaha.</v>

2422
01:52:01.930 --> 01:52:04.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me and hannah was a in that</v>

2423
01:52:04.121 --> 01:52:05.680
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you see his house?</v>

2424
01:52:05.830 --> 01:52:09.040
<v Speaker 2>Nope,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we airbnb the property and they</v>

2425
01:52:09.041 --> 01:52:14.041
<v Speaker 2>stared at us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you airbnb property in that</v>

2426
01:52:14.201 --> 01:52:17.020
<v Speaker 2>community and you have to have a cookout</v>
<v Speaker 2>at 5:00 in the morning,</v>

2427
01:52:19.060 --> 01:52:22.300
<v Speaker 2>you don't get some stairs and the next</v>
<v Speaker 2>day he had a cookout at 5:00 in the</v>

2428
01:52:22.301 --> 01:52:26.050
<v Speaker 2>morning show after party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then was it like when you making a</v>

2429
01:52:26.051 --> 01:52:27.970
<v Speaker 2>lot of noise or something?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

2430
01:52:27.971 --> 01:52:30.460
<v Speaker 2>Just the average is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2431
01:52:30.640 --> 01:52:33.700
<v Speaker 2>people make after they leave the club.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty loud,</v>

2432
01:52:33.890 --> 01:52:36.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stumbling around 5:00 in the morning.</v>

2433
01:52:36.480 --> 01:52:38.290
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would it be annoying as fuck if you live</v>

2434
01:52:38.291 --> 01:52:41.290
<v Speaker 2>next door to that house and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>try and get some sleep?</v>

2435
01:52:41.710 --> 01:52:42.730
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably.</v>

2436
01:52:42.990 --> 01:52:44.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The house across the street had three</v>

2437
01:52:44.870 --> 01:52:46.940
<v Speaker 2>volvos in the driveway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2438
01:52:47.010 --> 01:52:48.710
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a lot of safety.</v>

2439
01:52:48.950 --> 01:52:50.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot of white people.</v>

2440
01:52:50.190 --> 01:52:53.170
<v Speaker 2>That's too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It must be furious at you for waking up,</v>

2441
01:52:53.180 --> 01:52:54.500
<v Speaker 2>so I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We woke him up,</v>

2442
01:52:54.530 --> 01:52:57.290
<v Speaker 2>but the grill was outside and so they</v>
<v Speaker 2>can smell it.</v>

2443
01:52:57.370 --> 01:53:01.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they had chilean sea bass and we</v>

2444
01:53:01.340 --> 01:53:02.910
<v Speaker 2>came with an appetite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2445
01:53:03.170 --> 01:53:05.330
<v Speaker 2>but don't you think that that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably pretty loud.</v>

2446
01:53:05.360 --> 01:53:07.470
<v Speaker 2>Like how loud were you guys?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it was that lab.</v>

2447
01:53:07.490 --> 01:53:08.730
<v Speaker 2>I fell asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2448
01:53:10.060 --> 01:53:12.230
<v Speaker 2>but it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We did turn people away though.</v>

2449
01:53:12.950 --> 01:53:14.240
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many people were there?</v>

2450
01:53:14.480 --> 01:53:16.220
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it probably be like five</v>
<v Speaker 2>or seven,</v>

2451
01:53:16.310 --> 01:53:18.800
<v Speaker 2>but more came,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's chaos.</v>

2452
01:53:18.860 --> 01:53:21.920
<v Speaker 2>Five or seven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seven people that are awake at 5:00 in</v>

2453
01:53:21.921 --> 01:53:24.860
<v Speaker 2>the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those people were probably lit up loud</v>

2454
01:53:24.980 --> 01:53:28.250
<v Speaker 2>as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Barbecuing doesn't bother you.</v>

2455
01:53:28.280 --> 01:53:29.690
<v Speaker 2>I slept well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't bother me,</v>

2456
01:53:29.691 --> 01:53:31.280
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time I don't.</v>

2457
01:53:31.760 --> 01:53:36.080
<v Speaker 2>If I look at it from my neighborhood and</v>
<v Speaker 2>my neighborhoods I lived in and they</v>

2458
01:53:36.081 --> 01:53:38.390
<v Speaker 2>bring that bouncy castle over and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>play the myriad.</v>

2459
01:53:38.391 --> 01:53:40.910
<v Speaker 2>I see the 5:00 in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which happens.</v>

2460
01:53:41.280 --> 01:53:42.230
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2461
01:53:42.231 --> 01:53:43.280
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

2462
01:53:44.030 --> 01:53:46.100
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't hate on him though.</v>

2463
01:53:46.400 --> 01:53:47.233
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's,</v>

2464
01:53:47.590 --> 01:53:49.580
<v Speaker 2>that's the neighborhood that you chose</v>
<v Speaker 2>to live in.</v>

2465
01:53:49.660 --> 01:53:50.271
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2466
01:53:50.271 --> 01:53:51.830
<v Speaker 2>That's what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're saying,</v>

2467
01:53:51.831 --> 01:53:54.580
<v Speaker 2>you live in a mexican neighborhood here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually people asked for fucking</v>

2468
01:53:54.620 --> 01:53:56.340
<v Speaker 2>parties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got roosters in my niche kind of</v>

2469
01:53:56.390 --> 01:54:00.440
<v Speaker 2>deal that get up at 5:00 AM.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three am in the morning.</v>

2470
01:54:00.740 --> 01:54:03.500
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my gardener had the son of one of my</v>

2471
01:54:03.501 --> 01:54:06.770
<v Speaker 2>dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my gardeners friend of mine and he's</v>

2472
01:54:06.771 --> 01:54:08.630
<v Speaker 2>cool as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't speak very much english,</v>

2473
01:54:08.631 --> 01:54:09.710
<v Speaker 2>but he's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's cool as fuck.</v>

2474
01:54:10.190 --> 01:54:15.050
<v Speaker 2>He's got like 100 fucking roosters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>100 of them in his yard.</v>

2475
01:54:15.110 --> 01:54:18.320
<v Speaker 2>His yard is like a chicken fighting</v>
<v Speaker 2>ring.</v>

2476
01:54:19.970 --> 01:54:22.190
<v Speaker 2>Chicken fighting is different man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's funny,</v>

2477
01:54:22.400 --> 01:54:26.630
<v Speaker 2>like you tell people that you know</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody that fights dogs and they look</v>

2478
01:54:26.631 --> 01:54:31.631
<v Speaker 2>at you like what a monster of a person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because dogs are really complex and they</v>

2479
01:54:31.731 --> 01:54:34.310
<v Speaker 2>love you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have give you unconditional love</v>

2480
01:54:34.311 --> 01:54:37.760
<v Speaker 2>and for you to violate that and making</v>
<v Speaker 2>them fight each other is fucked up.</v>

2481
01:54:37.970 --> 01:54:39.140
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree with it.</v>

2482
01:54:39.200 --> 01:54:40.670
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that,</v>

2483
01:54:41.060 --> 01:54:42.440
<v Speaker 2>but you tell people that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2484
01:54:42.441 --> 01:54:44.650
<v Speaker 2>somebody fights chickens and they go</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2485
01:54:44.660 --> 01:54:47.280
<v Speaker 2>they don't even get grossed out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's some super vegans</v>

2486
01:54:47.320 --> 01:54:49.430
<v Speaker 2>probably get really pissed off or animal</v>
<v Speaker 2>rights activist,</v>

2487
01:54:49.610 --> 01:54:53.480
<v Speaker 2>but the average person doesn't give a</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck about a chicken and if those</v>

2488
01:54:53.481 --> 01:54:56.030
<v Speaker 2>chickens are fucking each other up with</v>
<v Speaker 2>spurs on,</v>

2489
01:54:56.060 --> 01:54:59.990
<v Speaker 2>they put like razor blades on their back</v>
<v Speaker 2>feet and they cut each other up.</v>

2490
01:55:00.440 --> 01:55:04.010
<v Speaker 2>I noticed that I saw a tape before vic</v>
<v Speaker 2>went down,</v>

2491
01:55:04.610 --> 01:55:09.610
<v Speaker 2>have a recruitment training tape and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was my first time seeing the</v>

2492
01:55:11.600 --> 01:55:14.390
<v Speaker 2>animals electrocuted and how they breed</v>
<v Speaker 2>them and stuff like that.</v>

2493
01:55:14.870 --> 01:55:18.740
<v Speaker 2>This was a real tight good that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>going around the hood because people was</v>

2494
01:55:18.741 --> 01:55:23.741
<v Speaker 2>fighting these animals and I know people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that executed dog that I'm closely</v>

2495
01:55:24.770 --> 01:55:26.210
<v Speaker 2>friends with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

2496
01:55:26.211 --> 01:55:28.970
<v Speaker 2>And it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2497
01:55:29.180 --> 01:55:32.480
<v Speaker 2>interesting situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But once again,</v>

2498
01:55:32.481 --> 01:55:33.920
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about people who was</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2499
01:55:33.950 --> 01:55:35.180
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we was treated worse than that.</v>

2500
01:55:35.210 --> 01:55:40.100
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's still that innately that's in you.</v>

2501
01:55:40.160 --> 01:55:43.980
<v Speaker 2>But it's shocking when people come out</v>
<v Speaker 2>against dogs like that and</v>

2502
01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:45.750
<v Speaker 1>that's why you have certain communities</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2503
01:55:45.780 --> 01:55:49.380
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what will we get shot by the cops or you</v>

2504
01:55:49.381 --> 01:55:50.910
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all this other stuff.</v>

2505
01:55:50.980 --> 01:55:54.220
<v Speaker 4>Well there's certain communities were</v>
<v Speaker 4>dog fighting is super normal to.</v>

2506
01:55:54.460 --> 01:55:55.740
<v Speaker 4>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like is this normal?</v>

2507
01:55:55.741 --> 01:56:00.741
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't a but I don't mean normal in</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it's like less offensive than how</v>

2508
01:56:01.120 --> 01:56:03.460
<v Speaker 4>the adult human beings are treated in</v>
<v Speaker 4>that neighborhood.</v>

2509
01:56:03.730 --> 01:56:05.200
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a part of the culture.</v>

2510
01:56:05.730 --> 01:56:06.563
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what I mean.</v>

2511
01:56:07.170 --> 01:56:08.560
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In the south,</v>

2512
01:56:08.710 --> 01:56:09.400
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2513
01:56:09.400 --> 01:56:12.340
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know dude who had like 30 dogs used to</v>

2514
01:56:12.341 --> 01:56:14.890
<v Speaker 4>keep 30 dogs in his yard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a professional pool player.</v>

2515
01:56:15.310 --> 01:56:20.260
<v Speaker 4>He had a big ass yard down in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was Kentucky and he,</v>

2516
01:56:20.410 --> 01:56:23.620
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was part of what he gambled on.</v>

2517
01:56:23.840 --> 01:56:27.430
<v Speaker 4>He had dogs that they train and they</v>
<v Speaker 4>would fight them,</v>

2518
01:56:27.970 --> 01:56:28.803
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and</v>

2519
01:56:30.160 --> 01:56:33.430
<v Speaker 4>the person that I am right now looks at</v>
<v Speaker 4>that and goes,</v>

2520
01:56:33.431 --> 01:56:35.680
<v Speaker 4>well that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a fucking terrible thing to do.</v>

2521
01:56:35.681 --> 01:56:36.890
<v Speaker 4>Like why would you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that?</v>

2522
01:56:36.970 --> 01:56:40.270
<v Speaker 4>That should be absolutely illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But him,</v>

2523
01:56:41.170 --> 01:56:45.280
<v Speaker 4>whatever his life was like him growing</v>
<v Speaker 4>up in wherever he grew up,</v>

2524
01:56:45.700 --> 01:56:48.040
<v Speaker 4>that was a normal thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I,</v>

2525
01:56:48.690 --> 01:56:51.920
<v Speaker 4>I absolutely judge them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I absolutely judge anybody there</v>

2526
01:56:51.980 --> 01:56:53.030
<v Speaker 1>does that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it is.</v>

2527
01:56:53.120 --> 01:56:54.320
<v Speaker 1>We don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2528
01:56:54.380 --> 01:56:55.370
<v Speaker 1>it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2529
01:56:55.750 --> 01:56:59.360
<v Speaker 1>and to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think understanding comes from me</v>

2530
01:56:59.361 --> 01:57:02.900
<v Speaker 1>personally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if we could really assess ourselves</v>

2531
01:57:02.901 --> 01:57:06.760
<v Speaker 1>and look at our demons and accept all</v>
<v Speaker 1>dana's right,</v>

2532
01:57:07.190 --> 01:57:10.400
<v Speaker 1>how bad that we could possibly do some</v>
<v Speaker 1>real fucked up things.</v>

2533
01:57:11.060 --> 01:57:15.500
<v Speaker 1>Then it will make us judges other less</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the conversation can be had</v>

2534
01:57:15.720 --> 01:57:18.290
<v Speaker 1>they try to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

2535
01:57:18.291 --> 01:57:23.291
<v Speaker 1>it's certain things that you see that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you accept depending on where you are</v>

2536
01:57:23.420 --> 01:57:24.380
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

2537
01:57:24.890 --> 01:57:28.670
<v Speaker 4>More than a lot of ways than what you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>saying is like those,</v>

2538
01:57:28.671 --> 01:57:31.520
<v Speaker 4>those principles of life and those</v>
<v Speaker 4>things that you're talking about,</v>

2539
01:57:31.610 --> 01:57:35.690
<v Speaker 4>these different patterns that you see in</v>
<v Speaker 4>electronics where the universe,</v>

2540
01:57:36.020 --> 01:57:40.310
<v Speaker 4>you kind of see that in life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see that in comedy to exactly what</v>

2541
01:57:40.311 --> 01:57:44.060
<v Speaker 4>you were talking about in comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like having gone through things,</v>

2542
01:57:44.061 --> 01:57:46.580
<v Speaker 4>making mistakes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>making things like really obvious and</v>

2543
01:57:46.581 --> 01:57:47.570
<v Speaker 4>then realizing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whoa,</v>

2544
01:57:47.840 --> 01:57:52.190
<v Speaker 4>I got to look at this for what it really</v>
<v Speaker 4>is versus people who look at things</v>

2545
01:57:52.490 --> 01:57:56.420
<v Speaker 4>through a distorted perception like most</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the people that you know that have</v>

2546
01:57:56.421 --> 01:57:59.750
<v Speaker 4>distorted perceptions of their own</v>
<v Speaker 4>abilities or distorted perceptions of</v>

2547
01:57:59.751 --> 01:58:02.030
<v Speaker 4>their own life or where they fit in in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the world.</v>

2548
01:58:02.420 --> 01:58:05.030
<v Speaker 4>Those are the people that don't progress</v>
<v Speaker 4>because they're not looking at</v>

2549
01:58:05.031 --> 01:58:06.680
<v Speaker 4>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not.</v>

2550
01:58:06.830 --> 01:58:11.830
<v Speaker 4>They're not taking these assessments of</v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves accurately so they're not</v>

2551
01:58:12.051 --> 01:58:14.150
<v Speaker 4>moving forward.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They stay where they're at because they</v>

2552
01:58:14.151 --> 01:58:17.810
<v Speaker 4>think that where they're at with</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever they're trying to do is good</v>

2553
01:58:17.811 --> 01:58:20.600
<v Speaker 4>enough or it's perfect or it's better</v>
<v Speaker 4>than it really is.</v>

2554
01:58:21.320 --> 01:58:23.560
<v Speaker 1>That's true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah.</v>

2555
01:58:23.920 --> 01:58:27.950
<v Speaker 1>What I learned from my last,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my acid trip that the one you saw me</v>

2556
01:58:27.951 --> 01:58:29.390
<v Speaker 1>today after that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2557
01:58:29.930 --> 01:58:34.930
<v Speaker 1>the in art and in our genes because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>saw idea or conception with.</v>

2558
01:58:37.581 --> 01:58:41.330
<v Speaker 1>I told you it moves everything for</v>

2559
01:58:42.060 --> 01:58:45.380
<v Speaker 2>my art,</v>
<v Speaker 2>moves everything forward and the jane,</v>

2560
01:58:45.390 --> 01:58:50.390
<v Speaker 2>like you have a child or you have an</v>
<v Speaker 2>idea that moves the culture or the human</v>

2561
01:58:52.390 --> 01:58:56.440
<v Speaker 2>species and everything continues to</v>
<v Speaker 2>evolve and move forward.</v>

2562
01:58:56.910 --> 01:59:01.910
<v Speaker 2>Without those things we would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We continue to make the same mistakes</v>

2563
01:59:01.991 --> 01:59:03.820
<v Speaker 2>over there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuck with certain things,</v>

2564
01:59:03.850 --> 01:59:05.080
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2565
01:59:05.081 --> 01:59:08.110
<v Speaker 2>We're fueled by these things that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>create,</v>

2566
01:59:08.230 --> 01:59:11.740
<v Speaker 2>whether their innovation or whether</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're a piece of art,</v>

2567
01:59:11.800 --> 01:59:13.070
<v Speaker 2>a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2568
01:59:13.150 --> 01:59:16.420
<v Speaker 2>we were fueled buddies things and</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes in a negative way.</v>

2569
01:59:16.421 --> 01:59:18.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many people have you met that act</v>

2570
01:59:18.850 --> 01:59:22.210
<v Speaker 2>like a movie?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they think they say things like</v>

2571
01:59:22.211 --> 01:59:23.710
<v Speaker 2>they're in a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2572
01:59:23.711 --> 01:59:25.690
<v Speaker 2>A bunch of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know a dude who got in a fight with</v>

2573
01:59:25.691 --> 01:59:28.810
<v Speaker 2>another dude and as they were scrapping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like as we're about to fight,</v>

2574
01:59:29.290 --> 01:59:30.280
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tonight,</v>

2575
01:59:30.281 --> 01:59:31.600
<v Speaker 2>we dine in hell.</v>

2576
01:59:34.690 --> 01:59:37.120
<v Speaker 2>He yelled that at him and the dude told</v>
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>

2577
01:59:37.121 --> 01:59:38.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you fucking serious?</v>

2578
01:59:38.321 --> 01:59:39.154
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2579
01:59:39.160 --> 01:59:40.390
<v Speaker 2>it really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really said that to me.</v>

2580
01:59:40.660 --> 01:59:42.250
<v Speaker 2>That's a layer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the guy was like,</v>

2581
01:59:42.251 --> 01:59:44.830
<v Speaker 2>why did you fucking say tonight we dine</v>
<v Speaker 2>in hell.</v>

2582
01:59:44.980 --> 01:59:47.120
<v Speaker 2>And so they get in a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the other guy,</v>

2583
01:59:47.530 --> 01:59:50.410
<v Speaker 2>the guy who didn't say that turned out</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be a really good wrestler.</v>

2584
01:59:50.411 --> 01:59:52.420
<v Speaker 2>So the whole thing was a disaster for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other guy.</v>

2585
01:59:52.480 --> 01:59:56.590
<v Speaker 2>Well the guy did the guy who said that</v>
<v Speaker 2>dying in hell that night.</v>

2586
01:59:56.710 --> 01:59:59.200
<v Speaker 2>Well not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's just he thought he was in a</v>

2587
01:59:59.201 --> 02:00:01.990
<v Speaker 2>fucking movie or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he was drunk too.</v>

2588
02:00:02.020 --> 02:00:03.260
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2589
02:00:03.790 --> 02:00:08.790
<v Speaker 2>But it's just that movies create these</v>
<v Speaker 2>scenarios in people's minds that they</v>

2590
02:00:09.581 --> 02:00:12.580
<v Speaker 2>almost want to reinvent in the real</v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

2591
02:00:12.820 --> 02:00:15.400
<v Speaker 2>If a similar situation presents itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2592
02:00:15.920 --> 02:00:18.280
<v Speaker 2>you really think you could say something</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking stupid.</v>

2593
02:00:19.190 --> 02:00:19.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

2594
02:00:19.880 --> 02:00:23.470
<v Speaker 2>I said some things before that sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

2595
02:00:23.480 --> 02:00:27.970
<v Speaker 2>And especially in the throes of passion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the throes of passion.</v>

2596
02:00:27.980 --> 02:00:30.440
<v Speaker 2>But by even poetic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

2597
02:00:31.360 --> 02:00:33.640
<v Speaker 2>That should be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That should be the title of your first</v>

2598
02:00:33.641 --> 02:00:36.160
<v Speaker 2>netflix special,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the throes of passion.</v>

2599
02:00:36.190 --> 02:00:39.820
<v Speaker 2>But byron bowers and you just sitting</v>
<v Speaker 2>there with your legs crossed with like</v>

2600
02:00:39.821 --> 02:00:42.610
<v Speaker 2>some nice slippers on in front of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>fire.</v>

2601
02:00:43.240 --> 02:00:45.340
<v Speaker 2>That's what I call it now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Reading a book.</v>

2602
02:00:45.770 --> 02:00:48.130
<v Speaker 2>That's what I called it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I won't even say fucking no more.</v>

2603
02:00:48.860 --> 02:00:52.450
<v Speaker 2>I call it because I feel I'd do</v>
<v Speaker 2>something a little more creative,</v>

2604
02:00:52.510 --> 02:00:54.820
<v Speaker 2>a little more different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't call it create just a lot more</v>

2605
02:00:54.821 --> 02:00:56.350
<v Speaker 2>involved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a little more.</v>

2606
02:00:56.450 --> 02:00:59.380
<v Speaker 2>There's a little more passionate about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're trying to separate yourself,</v>

2607
02:00:59.381 --> 02:01:00.580
<v Speaker 2>like your branding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your style.</v>

2608
02:01:00.581 --> 02:01:02.410
<v Speaker 2>Fucking oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't do that.</v>

2609
02:01:03.610 --> 02:01:05.540
<v Speaker 2>That'll be interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot of fucking right there.</v>

2610
02:01:06.400 --> 02:01:08.770
<v Speaker 2>Well you think about how many different</v>
<v Speaker 2>kinds of music there is.</v>

2611
02:01:08.920 --> 02:01:12.010
<v Speaker 2>There's only one pint of vodka and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know like it.</v>

2612
02:01:12.040 --> 02:01:15.730
<v Speaker 2>Music is a style of expressing what's</v>
<v Speaker 2>going on inside your mind,</v>

2613
02:01:15.731 --> 02:01:16.940
<v Speaker 2>your imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sodas.</v>

2614
02:01:17.010 --> 02:01:20.890
<v Speaker 2>So was fucking a lot of ways we should</v>
<v Speaker 2>have like different classifications for</v>

2615
02:01:20.891 --> 02:01:22.600
<v Speaker 2>fucking men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We kind of did.</v>

2616
02:01:22.601 --> 02:01:26.950
<v Speaker 2>We have basic bitch fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is like missionary little kisses.</v>

2617
02:01:27.320 --> 02:01:28.750
<v Speaker 2>Fucking grill.</v>

2618
02:01:29.140 --> 02:01:30.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's very important.</v>

2619
02:01:30.101 --> 02:01:32.320
<v Speaker 2>You need to couch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got stuff in the corner of the</v>

2620
02:01:32.321 --> 02:01:34.690
<v Speaker 2>couch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what gorilla fucking is about.</v>

2621
02:01:34.750 --> 02:01:37.260
<v Speaker 2>You gotta grab a hold of things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be all subtraction.</v>

2622
02:01:37.270 --> 02:01:40.580
<v Speaker 2>You might want to keep your shoes on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got some traction.</v>

<v Speaker 1>put it around her neck like a,</v>

2625
02:01:52.200 --> 02:01:54.040
<v Speaker 1>like a puppy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like elise.</v>

2626
02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:56.210
<v Speaker 1>And she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing?</v>

2627
02:01:56.300 --> 02:01:58.460
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the exact right thing to ask.</v>

2628
02:01:58.580 --> 02:02:00.750
<v Speaker 1>And I was like a normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2629
02:02:00.751 --> 02:02:02.210
<v Speaker 1>I'll show you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll show you.</v>

2630
02:02:02.211 --> 02:02:05.940
<v Speaker 1>Get up and try to move when she got to</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to move like that.</v>

2631
02:02:06.800 --> 02:02:08.840
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she liked it and it turned on.</v>

2632
02:02:09.530 --> 02:02:12.590
<v Speaker 1>And then to the fact that she wanted her</v>
<v Speaker 1>around her neck and I put it around her</v>

2633
02:02:12.591 --> 02:02:15.290
<v Speaker 1>neck and the more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2634
02:02:15.560 --> 02:02:16.490
<v Speaker 1>poor white girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2635
02:02:16.940 --> 02:02:19.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's gotta be,</v>

2636
02:02:19.430 --> 02:02:20.270
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2637
02:02:22.020 --> 02:02:24.230
<v Speaker 1>A jewish probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

2638
02:02:24.530 --> 02:02:29.300
<v Speaker 1>So I'm super liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jews and blacks now.</v>

2639
02:02:29.300 --> 02:02:32.000
<v Speaker 1>So as I'm pulling it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she got more turned on,</v>

2640
02:02:32.050 --> 02:02:37.050
<v Speaker 1>but then she died because he started</v>
<v Speaker 1>licking my thing and I got because I'm a</v>

2641
02:02:37.810 --> 02:02:42.260
<v Speaker 1>skinny dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody my was shaking like this and in</v>

2642
02:02:42.261 --> 02:02:44.450
<v Speaker 1>my mind I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this ain't me,</v>

2643
02:02:45.390 --> 02:02:47.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just let the rope go.</v>

2644
02:02:48.710 --> 02:02:51.800
<v Speaker 1>Follow your instincts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your instincts with the knock killer.</v>

2645
02:02:51.830 --> 02:02:53.660
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She wasn't gonna die and I don't think</v>

2646
02:02:53.661 --> 02:02:55.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you could definitely kill</v>

2647
02:02:55.701 --> 02:02:58.680
<v Speaker 1>someone with a belt around her neck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a length of rope,</v>

2648
02:02:59.350 --> 02:03:00.890
<v Speaker 1>but it's kind of like the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

2649
02:03:00.990 --> 02:03:02.000
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rope belt,</v>

2650
02:03:02.690 --> 02:03:05.340
<v Speaker 1>what kind of leather?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very good.</v>

2651
02:03:05.420 --> 02:03:06.940
<v Speaker 1>Very good leather,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2652
02:03:08.280 --> 02:03:10.380
<v Speaker 1>Very little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it seems like you definitely kill</v>

2653
02:03:10.381 --> 02:03:11.610
<v Speaker 1>somebody with a rope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It hurt.</v>

2654
02:03:11.890 --> 02:03:13.970
<v Speaker 1>It would hurt if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you hit them with the leather,</v>

2655
02:03:14.150 --> 02:03:16.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you can kill them if you can</v>

2656
02:03:16.820 --> 02:03:19.880
<v Speaker 1>like pull hard enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could kill somebody with any kind of</v>

2657
02:03:19.960 --> 02:03:22.670
<v Speaker 1>like thin wire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I could probably kill someone</v>

2658
02:03:22.671 --> 02:03:24.620
<v Speaker 1>with a boot lace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's probably true.</v>

2659
02:03:26.330 --> 02:03:28.610
<v Speaker 1>That's probably a true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be careful about that.</v>

2660
02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:33.370
<v Speaker 1>If I got a good grip on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know to to.</v>

2661
02:03:33.600 --> 02:03:34.680
<v Speaker 1>It's not hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

2662
02:03:34.681 --> 02:03:36.850
<v Speaker 1>the human nac is real vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2663
02:03:36.890 --> 02:03:39.020
<v Speaker 1>The weird part about that is having a</v>
<v Speaker 1>condom on,</v>

2664
02:03:39.700 --> 02:03:43.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what part of this is safe.</v>

2665
02:03:44.150 --> 02:03:49.110
<v Speaker 1>Like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's hilarious.</v>

2666
02:03:49.190 --> 02:03:54.190
<v Speaker 1>She's got ligature marks or nac but std</v>
<v Speaker 1>or she didn't get aids but she still</v>

2667
02:03:54.870 --> 02:03:55.703
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>

2668
02:03:57.800 --> 02:04:00.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rough sex is fucking strange,</v>

2669
02:04:00.261 --> 02:04:02.810
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gotta be real careful with that</v>

2670
02:04:03.020 --> 02:04:05.720
<v Speaker 1>because if you do weird shit and beat</v>
<v Speaker 1>each other up and the girl goes to the</v>

2671
02:04:05.721 --> 02:04:06.950
<v Speaker 1>cops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're fucked.</v>

2672
02:04:07.230 --> 02:04:08.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially if they're not the same race</v>

2673
02:04:09.850 --> 02:04:12.080
<v Speaker 1>and that's when black people will be</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I told you,</v>

2674
02:04:12.320 --> 02:04:16.370
<v Speaker 1>I told you I was reading about this</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing in toronto.</v>

2675
02:04:17.450 --> 02:04:21.270
<v Speaker 1>There was just this judge in toronto,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sentence,</v>

2676
02:04:21.271 --> 02:04:26.270
<v Speaker 1>this man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was convicted of rape and he had</v>

2677
02:04:26.271 --> 02:04:31.271
<v Speaker 1>consensual sex in his opinion with this</v>
<v Speaker 1>woman and this woman had sent them these</v>

2678
02:04:32.960 --> 02:04:34.940
<v Speaker 1>text messages saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2679
02:04:34.941 --> 02:04:37.440
<v Speaker 1>come on over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's have some savage sex and this and</v>

2680
02:04:37.441 --> 02:04:38.274
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2681
02:04:38.400 --> 02:04:40.230
<v Speaker 2>And then afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he broke up with her.</v>

2682
02:04:40.231 --> 02:04:43.740
<v Speaker 2>She decided or after they had a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 2>these experiences.</v>

2683
02:04:43.741 --> 02:04:46.170
<v Speaker 2>I forget how it works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>either way,</v>

2684
02:04:46.200 --> 02:04:51.200
<v Speaker 2>she lied to the judge and to the court</v>
<v Speaker 2>about sending those texts and then</v>

2685
02:04:51.540 --> 02:04:53.700
<v Speaker 2>because she had deleted them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then they somehow or another</v>

2686
02:04:53.701 --> 02:04:58.170
<v Speaker 2>recovered them and they found that she</v>
<v Speaker 2>lied about that and she lied about a few</v>

2687
02:04:58.171 --> 02:05:00.750
<v Speaker 2>other things too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the judge started quoting all this</v>

2688
02:05:00.751 --> 02:05:05.751
<v Speaker 2>feminist theory and quoting different</v>
<v Speaker 2>feminist writers and a wound up getting</v>

2689
02:05:07.831 --> 02:05:10.590
<v Speaker 2>this guy convicted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is beyond a reasonable doubt.</v>

2690
02:05:10.740 --> 02:05:15.330
<v Speaker 2>Like as soon as someone says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did not send him a text asking him for</v>

2691
02:05:15.331 --> 02:05:19.830
<v Speaker 2>sex and then you find out they did in</v>
<v Speaker 2>fact send a text asking them for sex and</v>

2692
02:05:19.831 --> 02:05:21.900
<v Speaker 2>it deleted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well then you've got reasonable doubt</v>

2693
02:05:22.080 --> 02:05:24.390
<v Speaker 2>like instantaneously you have doubt</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you have to go,</v>

2694
02:05:24.391 --> 02:05:27.120
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what about the rest of this stuff you're</v>

2695
02:05:27.121 --> 02:05:28.170
<v Speaker 2>telling me isn't true?</v>

2696
02:05:28.200 --> 02:05:32.730
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm not saying that he didn't force</v>
<v Speaker 2>her to give him a blow job or that he</v>

2697
02:05:32.731 --> 02:05:33.840
<v Speaker 2>did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2698
02:05:33.870 --> 02:05:35.100
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't.</v>

2699
02:05:35.101 --> 02:05:37.920
<v Speaker 2>The judge doesn't know either,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in my opinion,</v>

2700
02:05:38.190 --> 02:05:41.730
<v Speaker 2>you instantaneously have to have</v>
<v Speaker 2>reasonable doubt when you find out that</v>

2701
02:05:41.731 --> 02:05:44.880
<v Speaker 2>someone's willing to lie about certain</v>
<v Speaker 2>aspects of what happened.</v>

2702
02:05:44.910 --> 02:05:46.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2703
02:05:46.441 --> 02:05:47.274
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

2704
02:05:47.280 --> 02:05:49.500
<v Speaker 2>I was watching this and I was listening</v>
<v Speaker 2>to this,</v>

2705
02:05:49.501 --> 02:05:50.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this woman,</v>

2706
02:05:50.970 --> 02:05:51.990
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from what does that,</v>

2707
02:05:52.590 --> 02:05:55.860
<v Speaker 2>what's that conservative website,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the blaze or something like that.</v>

2708
02:05:56.790 --> 02:06:00.060
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it is that Glenn Beck</v>
<v Speaker 2>things and it is at the blaze.</v>

2709
02:06:01.060 --> 02:06:02.610
<v Speaker 2>She did this breakdown of it and I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2710
02:06:02.700 --> 02:06:04.770
<v Speaker 2>god,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so,</v>

2711
02:06:04.830 --> 02:06:07.620
<v Speaker 2>so dangerous when you get involved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crazy people.</v>

2712
02:06:07.621 --> 02:06:10.470
<v Speaker 2>You're sticking your dick and crazy</v>
<v Speaker 2>people like you don't,</v>

2713
02:06:10.530 --> 02:06:13.410
<v Speaker 2>you don't really know what's going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

2714
02:06:13.500 --> 02:06:15.390
<v Speaker 2>Like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're there choking that girl with a</v>

2715
02:06:15.391 --> 02:06:18.810
<v Speaker 2>rope and she's looking your arm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where's this going to escalate to,</v>

2716
02:06:19.320 --> 02:06:22.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can things only a volvo and these</v>

2717
02:06:23.040 --> 02:06:28.040
<v Speaker 2>kids</v>

2718
02:06:29.041 --> 02:06:33.150
<v Speaker 2>that you've been snipped and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't tell her that,</v>

2719
02:06:33.151 --> 02:06:34.230
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2720
02:06:34.260 --> 02:06:35.970
<v Speaker 2>you can't get pregnant.</v>

2721
02:06:36.120 --> 02:06:40.140
<v Speaker 2>So you keep pumping loads of nowhere and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to keep ramping up the sex.</v>

2722
02:06:40.170 --> 02:06:42.870
<v Speaker 2>And so now she's wearing a helmet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're fucking driving it through a</v>

2723
02:06:42.871 --> 02:06:43.860
<v Speaker 2>wall.</v>

<v Speaker 2>make her happy.</v>

2725
02:06:47.791 --> 02:06:51.060
<v Speaker 2>But you really don't like it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both of you are confused.</v>

2726
02:06:51.300 --> 02:06:54.630
<v Speaker 2>She thinks it makes you happy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you think it makes her happy and</v>

2727
02:06:54.660 --> 02:06:59.660
<v Speaker 2>you're just giving her cte and</v>
<v Speaker 2>throwing her head through wallboard.</v>

2728
02:07:00.100 --> 02:07:02.610
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone has for sure putting a helmet on</v>

2729
02:07:02.670 --> 02:07:05.280

<v Speaker 2>slammed her head through a wall.</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's 100 percent right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's definitely happened.</v>

<v Speaker 2>haven't seen before.</v>

2734
02:07:13.671 --> 02:07:16.350
<v Speaker 2>Did you know canadian lawyers have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>wear an outfit like this?</v>

<v Speaker 2>all good.</v>

<v Speaker 2>that's exactly what it is.</v>

<v Speaker 2>How can.</v>

2785
02:09:28.270 --> 02:09:31.210
<v Speaker 2>What does quaker oats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's religious cereal.</v>

2786
02:09:31.420 --> 02:09:32.780
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What it.</v>

2787
02:09:32.840 --> 02:09:33.880
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck does a quaker?</v>

2788
02:09:33.880 --> 02:09:36.700
<v Speaker 2>I have to do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't give a fuck about quakers.</v>

2789
02:09:36.910 --> 02:09:41.220
<v Speaker 2>Quakers were so innocuous that they were</v>
<v Speaker 2>willing to use them as props was like</v>

2790
02:09:41.250 --> 02:09:43.750
<v Speaker 2>the way they sell klondike bars with</v>
<v Speaker 2>polar bears.</v>

2791
02:09:44.050 --> 02:09:46.570
<v Speaker 2>They use the quaker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just says that was the first.</v>

2792
02:09:46.780 --> 02:09:50.230
<v Speaker 2>That was the right it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The layers.</v>

2793
02:09:50.690 --> 02:09:53.470
<v Speaker 2>Don't you think that's what they did?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That do make sense.</v>

2794
02:09:53.530 --> 02:09:56.230
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet quakers had fucking zero interest</v>

2795
02:09:56.231 --> 02:09:58.300
<v Speaker 2>in quaker oats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet they don't get paid.</v>

2796
02:09:58.301 --> 02:10:00.280
<v Speaker 2>I bet they get fucked over on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>commissions.</v>

2797
02:10:00.610 --> 02:10:02.980
<v Speaker 2>I bet the quaker oats company keeps all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the money.</v>

2798
02:10:03.020 --> 02:10:05.020
<v Speaker 2>Pepsi owns it now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>

2799
02:10:05.770 --> 02:10:08.620
<v Speaker 2>Those quakers are out there going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>

2800
02:10:08.770 --> 02:10:11.680
<v Speaker 2>This is ours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is our outfit.</v>

2801
02:10:12.160 --> 02:10:14.980
<v Speaker 2>But you look at that outfit and you go</v>
<v Speaker 2>that some wholesome oats.</v>

2802
02:10:15.160 --> 02:10:18.760
<v Speaker 2>I bet that oats doesn't even swear he</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't drink.</v>

2803
02:10:18.761 --> 02:10:23.020
<v Speaker 2>That oats makes its own butter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That oats lives and the either niceness</v>

<v Speaker 2>falchuk way in a field and they plow</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the fucking like a regular</v>

<v Speaker 4>delivered to you.</v>

2901
02:14:33.461 --> 02:14:34.660

<v Speaker 4>Ah</v>

02:14:34.710 --> 02:14:36.640
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a good thing.</v>

2903
02:14:36.680 --> 02:14:37.630
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since I lived,</v>

2904
02:14:37.690 --> 02:14:41.710
<v Speaker 1>I was born in athens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My first six years in athens is a small</v>

2905
02:14:41.711 --> 02:14:46.711
<v Speaker 1>town with uga is even athens before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So everything I ate vegetable wise was</v>

2906
02:14:47.471 --> 02:14:49.000
<v Speaker 1>grown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2907
02:14:49.250 --> 02:14:50.410
<v Speaker 1>in that area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the yard,</v>

2908
02:14:50.440 --> 02:14:52.480
<v Speaker 1>in the backyard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing there.</v>

2909
02:14:52.630 --> 02:14:56.560
<v Speaker 1>The grapes on the vine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tomatoes came out the ground,</v>

2910
02:14:56.561 --> 02:14:58.170
<v Speaker 1>the chickens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2911
02:14:58.270 --> 02:15:00.040
<v Speaker 1>my grandfather haul chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the chicken,</v>

2912
02:15:00.041 --> 02:15:03.820
<v Speaker 1>the a's came out of the backyard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He shot there,</v>

2913
02:15:03.940 --> 02:15:08.470
<v Speaker 1>we fished on saturdays for cut the fish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's off,</v>

2914
02:15:08.530 --> 02:15:10.990
<v Speaker 1>get the skin off and they're from in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>yard.</v>

2915
02:15:11.710 --> 02:15:16.710
<v Speaker 1>He took the grapes from the vines and</v>
<v Speaker 1>made wine and if he caught an abundance</v>

2916
02:15:17.441 --> 02:15:19.330
<v Speaker 1>of fish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he will keep enough for her family and</v>

2917
02:15:19.690 --> 02:15:24.390
<v Speaker 1>all the neighbors traded food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my first six years is like,</v>

2918
02:15:24.400 --> 02:15:25.090
<v Speaker 1>when you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>

2919
02:15:25.090 --> 02:15:27.030
<v Speaker 1>eight or 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they put a pellet gun in your hand,</v>

2920
02:15:27.040 --> 02:15:28.570
<v Speaker 1>you work your way up to a hunting</v>
<v Speaker 1>rifles.</v>

2921
02:15:29.350 --> 02:15:32.290
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's what I left when I moved to</v>

2922
02:15:32.291 --> 02:15:33.640
<v Speaker 1>the city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

2923
02:15:33.830 --> 02:15:36.640
<v Speaker 1>So I was a country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so vegetables and everything tasted</v>

2924
02:15:36.641 --> 02:15:38.050
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>

<v Speaker 1>grandma and corn was yellow.</v>

2926
02:15:42.851 --> 02:15:45.520
<v Speaker 1>It was like a lighter color.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like a whitish color.</v>

2927
02:15:46.110 --> 02:15:49.340
<v Speaker 1>She make cream corn from scratch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2928
02:15:49.960 --> 02:15:52.270
<v Speaker 1>the preserves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was jelly was made.</v>

2929
02:15:52.850 --> 02:15:56.260
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rabbits squirrel,</v>

2930
02:15:56.261 --> 02:15:58.420
<v Speaker 1>the pks fell out of the tree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can third,</v>

2931
02:15:58.450 --> 02:16:00.550
<v Speaker 1>you hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just go outside at any time and grab</v>

2932
02:16:00.551 --> 02:16:02.780
<v Speaker 1>food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grab two peanuts,</v>

2933
02:16:03.090 --> 02:16:05.500
<v Speaker 1>squeezing with your hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got a snack,</v>

2934
02:16:05.760 --> 02:16:07.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

2935
02:16:07.220 --> 02:16:10.570
<v Speaker 1>that was the first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like six years,</v>

2936
02:16:10.571 --> 02:16:14.080
<v Speaker 1>like food was there things you put them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get a bucket,</v>

2937
02:16:14.090 --> 02:16:16.210
<v Speaker 1>you opened them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He used to run your thumb,</v>

2938
02:16:16.470 --> 02:16:19.180
<v Speaker 1>thumb through them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I didn't like none of that,</v>

2939
02:16:19.240 --> 02:16:22.210
<v Speaker 1>but that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what it was.</v>

2940
02:16:22.950 --> 02:16:24.850
<v Speaker 1>Well there's something beautiful about</v>
<v Speaker 1>that right?</v>

2941
02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:26.290
<v Speaker 1>At this point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2942
02:16:26.440 --> 02:16:28.480
<v Speaker 1>At this point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they overcharge them for that</v>

2943
02:16:28.481 --> 02:16:30.170
<v Speaker 1>stuff now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for</v>

2944
02:16:30.170 --> 02:16:31.810
<v Speaker 2>them it is not easy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it looked.</v>

2945
02:16:31.870 --> 02:16:33.660
<v Speaker 2>They made it look easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2946
02:16:33.700 --> 02:16:36.700
<v Speaker 2>it's large scale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody could do it like that.</v>

2947
02:16:36.701 --> 02:16:39.610
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to have small populations of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people with good pieces of land.</v>

2948
02:16:39.750 --> 02:16:42.160
<v Speaker 2>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure your grandfather had to have</v>

2949
02:16:42.161 --> 02:16:44.140
<v Speaker 2>some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My grandfather had a similar situation</v>

2950
02:16:44.141 --> 02:16:46.660
<v Speaker 2>in New Jersey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had a pretty good sized backyard.</v>

2951
02:16:47.140 --> 02:16:49.960
<v Speaker 2>It was all garden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had his area where he would drive to</v>

2952
02:16:49.961 --> 02:16:53.620
<v Speaker 2>his driveway and then everything to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>right of the driveway was all sticks in</v>

2953
02:16:53.621 --> 02:16:58.200
<v Speaker 2>the ground and tomato plants and my</v>
<v Speaker 2>grandfather grew everything and they</v>

2954
02:16:58.210 --> 02:17:02.410
<v Speaker 2>turned their tomatoes into tomato sauce</v>
<v Speaker 2>and my grandmother made homemade tomato</v>

2955
02:17:02.411 --> 02:17:05.230
<v Speaker 2>sauce and like all of his vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would grow.</v>

2956
02:17:05.231 --> 02:17:08.560
<v Speaker 2>Everything that he would eat all year</v>
<v Speaker 2>would be like in that garden.</v>

2957
02:17:08.890 --> 02:17:10.570
<v Speaker 2>That's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a normal thing for the</v>

2958
02:17:10.600 --> 02:17:11.433
<v Speaker 2>immigrants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2959
02:17:11.980 --> 02:17:14.560
<v Speaker 2>for people who grew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who came here from other parts of the</v>

2960
02:17:14.561 --> 02:17:18.370
<v Speaker 2>world where you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had to have a supply of food,</v>

2961
02:17:18.371 --> 02:17:19.204
<v Speaker 2>which is true.</v>

2962
02:17:19.660 --> 02:17:20.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it only makes sense.</v>

2963
02:17:21.190 --> 02:17:24.010
<v Speaker 2>We figured out a way to truck things in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People have,</v>

2964
02:17:24.011 --> 02:17:25.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once we start tracking things in,</v>

2965
02:17:25.871 --> 02:17:29.380
<v Speaker 2>nobody grows anything anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard a story about people like my</v>

2966
02:17:29.381 --> 02:17:34.150
<v Speaker 2>uncle and his friend I have in money and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they put $300 together and bought a goat</v>

2967
02:17:34.690 --> 02:17:36.980
<v Speaker 2>and ate off that goat.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

2986
02:18:26.021 --> 02:18:27.310
<v Speaker 2>it's safe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's healthy.</v>

02:18:27.730 --> 02:18:29.080
<v Speaker 2>Like this is an animal.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2989
02:18:30.791 --> 02:18:32.590
<v Speaker 2>he's trying to explain this to me in his</v>
<v Speaker 2>broken english.</v>

2990
02:18:32.950 --> 02:18:34.990
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know where this animals meat comes</v>

2991
02:18:34.991 --> 02:18:37.450
<v Speaker 2>from.</v>

2992
02:18:37.451 --> 02:18:39.610
<v Speaker 2>with that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you buy meat yourself,</v>

2993
02:18:39.611 --> 02:18:41.710
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he didn't understand,</v>

2994
02:18:41.711 --> 02:18:42.670

<v Speaker 2>someone would have a problem with him</v>

2996
02:18:45.731 --> 02:18:47.050
<v Speaker 2>killing a goat and a yard.</v>

2997
02:18:47.430 --> 02:18:49.360
<v Speaker 2>Like course I killed the goat in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>yard.</v>

2998
02:18:49.361 --> 02:18:52.120
<v Speaker 2>What do you want me to kill a kid?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It didn't make sense to him.</v>

2999
02:18:52.510 --> 02:18:54.010
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't kill a goat in the yard.</v>

3000
02:18:54.011 --> 02:18:56.050
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where the fuck do you kill your goat?</v>

3001
02:18:56.450 --> 02:18:57.640
<v Speaker 2>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't kill your kid.</v>

3002
02:18:57.950 --> 02:19:00.310
<v Speaker 2>Strange like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well what do you get your meat?</v>

3003
02:19:00.340 --> 02:19:01.700
<v Speaker 2>You go to the store.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

3004
02:19:01.750 --> 02:19:03.710
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't know where that fucking meat</v>

3005
02:19:03.720 --> 02:19:06.310
<v Speaker 2>even came for his idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was alien.</v>

3006
02:19:07.070 --> 02:19:08.930
<v Speaker 2>It's the logic is man of how things</v>
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

3007
02:19:08.970 --> 02:19:11.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm too weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're like,</v>

3008
02:19:11.050 --> 02:19:12.310
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you talk to older people,</v>

3009
02:19:12.410 --> 02:19:17.410
<v Speaker 2>you understand struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what people actually went</v>

3010
02:19:18.401 --> 02:19:23.401
<v Speaker 2>through and on a good part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like my grandma taught me about the</v>

3011
02:19:23.621 --> 02:19:25.100
<v Speaker 2>first dryers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3012
02:19:25.770 --> 02:19:28.300
<v Speaker 2>And my grandma like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3013
02:19:28.580 --> 02:19:31.820
<v Speaker 1>don't use it once a month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once a month.</v>

3014
02:19:31.850 --> 02:19:32.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't because they,</v>

3015
02:19:33.040 --> 02:19:35.930
<v Speaker 1>you know this better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The of lennon in the sun.</v>

3016
02:19:37.070 --> 02:19:40.910
<v Speaker 1>It still better to dry your clothes in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sun because the sun kills bacteria.</v>

3017
02:19:42.050 --> 02:19:43.100
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why you will.</v>

3018
02:19:43.240 --> 02:19:44.690
<v Speaker 1>If you look at how to tie them and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

3019
02:19:44.750 --> 02:19:46.940
<v Speaker 1>how do you take care of denim and keeps</v>
<v Speaker 1>it from fading,</v>

3020
02:19:47.350 --> 02:19:51.110
<v Speaker 1>they'd be like it and hanging in the sun</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the sun kills the bacteria that</v>

3021
02:19:51.120 --> 02:19:55.250
<v Speaker 1>gets rid of the smell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when I'm in jeans fade because of,</v>

3022
02:19:56.150 --> 02:19:59.610
<v Speaker 1>because of the now you want to clean</v>
<v Speaker 1>your genes because it might get smells</v>

3023
02:19:59.611 --> 02:20:00.890
<v Speaker 1>and the like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you break it in jeans,</v>

3024
02:20:00.891 --> 02:20:03.480
<v Speaker 1>you really don't watch him like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know you were.</v>

3025
02:20:03.481 --> 02:20:08.481
<v Speaker 1>I'm just like everyday type stuff and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dye in the denim fades and it at the</v>

3026
02:20:08.931 --> 02:20:13.931
<v Speaker 1>cotton shrinks and all that bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So hang them in the sun,</v>

3027
02:20:14.660 --> 02:20:16.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to keep it from shrinking.</v>

3028
02:20:16.390 --> 02:20:19.550
<v Speaker 1>That keep them from shrinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was heat though.</v>

3029
02:20:19.551 --> 02:20:22.900
<v Speaker 1>That was just the water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the evaporation from the</v>

3030
02:20:22.910 --> 02:20:24.860
<v Speaker 1>extreme heat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extreme dryer,</v>

3031
02:20:25.280 --> 02:20:26.600
<v Speaker 1>that's what makes them shrink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3032
02:20:27.080 --> 02:20:28.790
<v Speaker 1>But if you hang it in the sun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're still.</v>

3033
02:20:28.791 --> 02:20:33.320
<v Speaker 1>The sun still kills some of the bacteria</v>
<v Speaker 1>and stuff and it makes sense.</v>

3034
02:20:33.650 --> 02:20:35.420
<v Speaker 1>But if you ever drive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you ever like,</v>

3035
02:20:35.890 --> 02:20:37.760
<v Speaker 1>we don't do it here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I did something.</v>

3036
02:20:37.810 --> 02:20:40.930
<v Speaker 1>I had to stay in the country home and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you watch like a sheet or a shirt and</v>

3037
02:20:40.931 --> 02:20:44.440
<v Speaker 1>you hang out in the sun and with the air</v>
<v Speaker 1>hit it and it just the freshness of the</v>

3038
02:20:44.441 --> 02:20:45.350
<v Speaker 1>smell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3039
02:20:46.560 --> 02:20:51.560
<v Speaker 1>and what was smart about this place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they put the lemon trees near the</v>

3040
02:20:52.550 --> 02:20:56.040
<v Speaker 1>hanging place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now you're close to the city.</v>

3041
02:20:56.210 --> 02:20:57.960
<v Speaker 1>A lemon smell to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3042
02:20:58.100 --> 02:21:01.580
<v Speaker 1>Because the wind that comes through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That make sense?</v>

3043
02:21:01.820 --> 02:21:03.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does actually make sense.</v>

3044
02:21:04.310 --> 02:21:07.280
<v Speaker 1>But if you're in a city and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>polluted,</v>

3045
02:21:07.550 --> 02:21:08.780
<v Speaker 1>that's different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's different.</v>

3046
02:21:08.781 --> 02:21:09.614
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're</v>

3047
02:21:09.770 --> 02:21:13.280
<v Speaker 4>clothes might smell funky.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that's the weirdest thing to me is</v>

3048
02:21:13.490 --> 02:21:15.620
<v Speaker 4>when people are around people who smoke</v>
<v Speaker 4>cigarettes,</v>

3049
02:21:15.621 --> 02:21:18.170
<v Speaker 4>how strong the smell is in there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Close.</v>

3050
02:21:18.171 --> 02:21:21.440
<v Speaker 4>Strong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I never realized it until I would</v>

3051
02:21:21.830 --> 02:21:25.880
<v Speaker 4>come home from back when you could smoke</v>
<v Speaker 4>in clubs.</v>

3052
02:21:27.050 --> 02:21:28.430
<v Speaker 4>It was a big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Comedy clubs,</v>

3053
02:21:28.431 --> 02:21:29.960
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean everybody smoked.</v>

3054
02:21:29.961 --> 02:21:31.910
<v Speaker 4>It was just constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'd go to a bar,</v>

3055
02:21:31.911 --> 02:21:33.500
<v Speaker 4>everybody smoked,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you would go to comedy clubs.</v>

3056
02:21:33.501 --> 02:21:38.120
<v Speaker 4>Everybody smoked and I remember not</v>
<v Speaker 4>realizing when I smelled like and then</v>

3057
02:21:38.121 --> 02:21:40.880
<v Speaker 4>taking a shower and then picking up my</v>
<v Speaker 4>clothes and be like,</v>

3058
02:21:40.881 --> 02:21:44.810
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like they stunk.</v>

3059
02:21:44.840 --> 02:21:47.720
<v Speaker 4>It's smells bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is a weird thing,</v>

3060
02:21:47.721 --> 02:21:50.710
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that people have something that gives</v>

3061
02:21:50.711 --> 02:21:54.260
<v Speaker 4>him cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It makes everyone around them stink.</v>

3062
02:21:54.860 --> 02:21:57.110
<v Speaker 4>Like not even me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't even smoking,</v>

3063
02:21:57.320 --> 02:22:01.550
<v Speaker 4>but being around those people made me</v>
<v Speaker 4>stink and people like,</v>

3064
02:22:01.551 --> 02:22:05.090
<v Speaker 4>who cares?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I need my smokes.</v>

3065
02:22:07.160 --> 02:22:09.420
<v Speaker 1>I used to smell like gasoline when I had</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nine,</v>

3066
02:22:09.450 --> 02:22:13.310
<v Speaker 1>four it because they had a hairline</v>
<v Speaker 1>crack in the gas tank,</v>

3067
02:22:13.910 --> 02:22:17.900
<v Speaker 1>so if you fill it all the way up to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>funerals that get in the car.</v>

3068
02:22:18.200 --> 02:22:19.660
<v Speaker 1>My barracuda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to have to drive with him</v>

3069
02:22:19.740 --> 02:22:23.180
<v Speaker 4>window open,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking terrible smoke and fumes and</v>

3070
02:22:23.190 --> 02:22:24.300
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're getting that car.</v>

3071
02:22:24.660 --> 02:22:27.120
<v Speaker 4>Worst smell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember the gasoline smell.</v>

3072
02:22:27.720 --> 02:22:31.200
<v Speaker 4>I remember that car and I met in that</v>
<v Speaker 4>stu about that car and you really broke</v>

3073
02:22:31.201 --> 02:22:34.170
<v Speaker 4>it down kinda with and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3074
02:22:34.171 --> 02:22:36.960
<v Speaker 4>this is a real old school car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the problems that people I know</v>

3075
02:22:36.961 --> 02:22:40.650
<v Speaker 4>have an old schools.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They car was built to look great.</v>

3076
02:22:41.130 --> 02:22:45.210
<v Speaker 4>That was a problem with the suspension,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the setup and everything was very low.</v>

3077
02:22:45.920 --> 02:22:50.000
<v Speaker 4>She was very low to the ground because</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was so low to the ground and bottom</v>

3078
02:22:50.001 --> 02:22:50.860
<v Speaker 4>out on things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3079
02:22:51.300 --> 02:22:53.040
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it didn't handle very well because it</v>

3080
02:22:53.041 --> 02:22:56.040
<v Speaker 4>wasn't designed for that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was just designed to be like a really</v>

3081
02:22:56.041 --> 02:22:57.930
<v Speaker 4>low car,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it was tubbed.</v>

3082
02:22:58.230 --> 02:23:01.030
<v Speaker 4>So the back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the back area where the backseat is,</v>

3083
02:23:01.031 --> 02:23:05.790
<v Speaker 4>was all cut out and then the frame was</v>
<v Speaker 4>welded and bent up so that the wheel</v>

3084
02:23:05.850 --> 02:23:07.470
<v Speaker 4>tuck deep back wheel.</v>

3085
02:23:07.470 --> 02:23:08.790
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it looks great.</v>

3086
02:23:08.850 --> 02:23:11.180
<v Speaker 4>I seen him as stupid as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I watched the being made.</v>

3087
02:23:11.250 --> 02:23:12.800
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and um,</v>

3088
02:23:13.230 --> 02:23:14.760
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I learned with my friends who got old</v>

3089
02:23:14.761 --> 02:23:15.930
<v Speaker 4>school cars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Once you've started,</v>

3090
02:23:15.931 --> 02:23:18.420
<v Speaker 4>you just can't modify.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One thing was certain cars,</v>

3091
02:23:19.150 --> 02:23:21.130
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially when it comes to suspension</v>

3092
02:23:21.131 --> 02:23:23.520
<v Speaker 4>and wheels and not doing the brakes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3093
02:23:23.521 --> 02:23:25.500
<v Speaker 4>you know what they do now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's really interesting.</v>

3094
02:23:25.860 --> 02:23:30.860
<v Speaker 4>They do these different companies have</v>
<v Speaker 4>suspensions and frames that they build</v>

3095
02:23:31.441 --> 02:23:32.600
<v Speaker 4>for these old cars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3096
02:23:32.601 --> 02:23:34.110
<v Speaker 4>That's one of the problems with those</v>
<v Speaker 4>old cars.</v>

3097
02:23:34.111 --> 02:23:37.590
<v Speaker 4>You're like the suspension and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>frames are just,</v>

3098
02:23:37.620 --> 02:23:40.200
<v Speaker 4>it's so whack,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which don't have fully independent</v>

3099
02:23:40.201 --> 02:23:43.830
<v Speaker 4>suspension there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The way it's all set up is so old</v>

3100
02:23:43.831 --> 02:23:46.290
<v Speaker 4>school,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they have some upgrades and that can</v>

3101
02:23:46.291 --> 02:23:48.390
<v Speaker 4>definitely enhance the way these cars</v>
<v Speaker 4>perform,</v>

3102
02:23:48.690 --> 02:23:51.180
<v Speaker 4>but now they do say certain companies</v>
<v Speaker 4>like art morrison,</v>

3103
02:23:51.600 --> 02:23:56.410
<v Speaker 4>they take a suspension and they build a</v>
<v Speaker 4>frame and it's like say if you're going</v>

3104
02:23:56.411 --> 02:24:01.411
<v Speaker 4>to build like a 1969 mustang,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they would build a frame and suspension</v>

3105
02:24:02.611 --> 02:24:06.630
<v Speaker 4>for the [inaudible] 69 mustang,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you take the old body and you</v>

3106
02:24:06.631 --> 02:24:09.960
<v Speaker 4>bolted down to this modern frame</v>
<v Speaker 4>suspension.</v>

3107
02:24:09.960 --> 02:24:13.110
<v Speaker 4>You have a car that performs infinitely</v>
<v Speaker 4>credits and the original car,</v>

3108
02:24:13.320 --> 02:24:14.730
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be waste,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stiffer,</v>

3109
02:24:14.910 --> 02:24:18.150
<v Speaker 4>it's way better designed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then they have all these suspension</v>

3110
02:24:18.151 --> 02:24:20.490
<v Speaker 4>improvements.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now they've figured out a way to make</v>

3111
02:24:20.820 --> 02:24:23.910
<v Speaker 4>suspensions that adjust the way on</v>
<v Speaker 4>modern car does.</v>

3112
02:24:24.060 --> 02:24:27.360
<v Speaker 4>So it just constantly like thousands of</v>
<v Speaker 4>times a second.</v>

3113
02:24:27.820 --> 02:24:31.320
<v Speaker 4>So if you're driving a car,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if you say like you get a brand new</v>

3114
02:24:31.321 --> 02:24:32.910
<v Speaker 4>bmw seven series,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3115
02:24:33.270 --> 02:24:37.110
<v Speaker 4>those things are smooth as a baby's ass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just whooo.</v>

3116
02:24:37.730 --> 02:24:40.350
<v Speaker 4>So comfortable with that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And one of the reasons why they're so</v>

3117
02:24:40.351 --> 02:24:45.120
<v Speaker 4>comfortable is there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the suspension is constantly adjusting.</v>

3118
02:24:45.450 --> 02:24:49.800
<v Speaker 4>It's constantly adjusting to whether</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's bumpy outside are smooth and every</v>

3119
02:24:49.801 --> 02:24:54.801
<v Speaker 4>bump that it hits it calibrates what it</v>
<v Speaker 4>needs to do to adjust for this impact.</v>

3120
02:24:55.260 --> 02:24:58.230
<v Speaker 4>And you get this incredibly stabilized,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3121
02:24:58.620 --> 02:25:00.660
<v Speaker 4>I'm doing a shitty job of explain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of people right now,</v>

3122
02:25:00.670 --> 02:25:02.990
<v Speaker 4>there's car experts like you don't know</v>
<v Speaker 4>who to go.</v>

3123
02:25:03.030 --> 02:25:07.380
<v Speaker 4>Cars that make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know enough to kind of butchered that,</v>

3124
02:25:07.620 --> 02:25:08.910
<v Speaker 4>but this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3125
02:25:08.940 --> 02:25:13.080
<v Speaker 4>they know now they know how to do that</v>
<v Speaker 4>with old school cars so they can take</v>

3126
02:25:13.081 --> 02:25:18.081
<v Speaker 4>that 1969 mustang and put a similar type</v>
<v Speaker 4>of computerized suspension arrangement</v>

3127
02:25:19.801 --> 02:25:23.320
<v Speaker 4>in it where it's constantly adjusting to</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3128
02:25:23.321 --> 02:25:24.000
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3129
02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:25.570
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the terrain.</v>

3130
02:25:26.260 --> 02:25:29.530
<v Speaker 2>They're also figuring out how to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>antilock brakes on old cars.</v>

3131
02:25:29.531 --> 02:25:31.120
<v Speaker 2>They haven't figured out that totally</v>
<v Speaker 2>yet.</v>

3132
02:25:31.580 --> 02:25:33.850
<v Speaker 2>That's a little bit of a struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>

3133
02:25:33.910 --> 02:25:35.430
<v Speaker 2>a friend of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

3134
02:25:35.950 --> 02:25:39.430
<v Speaker 2>he bills and sell cars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he knows exactly which ones he</v>

3135
02:25:39.431 --> 02:25:41.340
<v Speaker 2>liked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the 71 chevelle.</v>

3136
02:25:41.750 --> 02:25:43.390
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had the 68 colbert,</v>

3137
02:25:43.391 --> 02:25:45.790
<v Speaker 2>which I drove,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that was two cars and scary.</v>

3138
02:25:45.791 --> 02:25:50.080
<v Speaker 2>I drove the 68 cobra mustang.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He put 10,000 into the motor and it was</v>

3139
02:25:50.081 --> 02:25:53.890
<v Speaker 2>like over 500 horses and if it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it rained a little bit,</v>

3140
02:25:53.980 --> 02:25:55.630
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3141
02:25:55.810 --> 02:25:59.080
<v Speaker 2>for me it had a kenny bail blower on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh god.</v>

3142
02:25:59.290 --> 02:26:03.070
<v Speaker 2>And that was my first experience with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>supercharger and how hype they are</v>

3143
02:26:03.160 --> 02:26:05.440
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you could lose control of that</v>

3144
02:26:05.441 --> 02:26:06.550
<v Speaker 2>car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Easy.</v>

3145
02:26:06.640 --> 02:26:09.220
<v Speaker 2>And a viper or jews.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3146
02:26:09.310 --> 02:26:12.760
<v Speaker 2>I drove a viper before I drove one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>those ones and a rented one.</v>

3147
02:26:13.150 --> 02:26:16.330
<v Speaker 2>I have valet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got lucky and just an idol.</v>

3148
02:26:16.331 --> 02:26:18.220
<v Speaker 2>That call goes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just goes.</v>

3149
02:26:18.310 --> 02:26:19.900
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you've seen the new ones.</v>

3150
02:26:20.170 --> 02:26:22.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have a poll is up.</v>

3151
02:26:22.960 --> 02:26:27.910
<v Speaker 2>They have this new viper viper ar</v>
<v Speaker 2>something I think it's called.</v>

3152
02:26:27.911 --> 02:26:31.720
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what it's called,</v>
<v Speaker 2>attack that attack mode.</v>

3153
02:26:32.560 --> 02:26:37.090
<v Speaker 2>This thing is fucking insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's basically a race car that you could</v>

3154
02:26:37.091 --> 02:26:38.890
<v Speaker 2>buy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what they're doing with these vipers</v>

3155
02:26:38.891 --> 02:26:40.420
<v Speaker 2>is that bringing them to these race</v>
<v Speaker 2>cars,</v>

3156
02:26:40.421 --> 02:26:42.880
<v Speaker 2>these race tracks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it just breaks every record,</v>

3157
02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:44.500
<v Speaker 2>every race,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every race track.</v>

3158
02:26:44.501 --> 02:26:45.770
<v Speaker 2>They take it on this thing break,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3159
02:26:45.850 --> 02:26:48.820
<v Speaker 2>Breaks records,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it looks ridiculous.</v>

3160
02:26:49.540 --> 02:26:51.880
<v Speaker 2>Even the curves straight away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh fuck you.</v>

3161
02:26:51.881 --> 02:26:53.800
<v Speaker 2>At curves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got giant tires on it.</v>

3162
02:26:54.040 --> 02:26:57.330
<v Speaker 2>The tires are super wide and it's got</v>
<v Speaker 2>more than 600 horsepower.</v>

3163
02:26:57.340 --> 02:26:59.350
<v Speaker 2>What is it called?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jimmy acr.</v>

3164
02:26:59.710 --> 02:27:00.660
<v Speaker 2>Acr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

3165
02:27:00.670 --> 02:27:03.130
<v Speaker 2>Easier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to look at this thing.</v>

3166
02:27:03.320 --> 02:27:06.460
<v Speaker 2>The deep bevels in the hood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at that face.</v>

3167
02:27:06.520 --> 02:27:08.890
<v Speaker 2>Get the fuck outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You kidding me?</v>

3168
02:27:09.670 --> 02:27:14.670
<v Speaker 2>It's supposed to be just a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>preposterous automobile and you could</v>

3169
02:27:15.320 --> 02:27:17.230
<v Speaker 2>buy that at a store.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3170
02:27:17.231 --> 02:27:20.650
<v Speaker 2>it has ground effects that come right</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of a race car,</v>

3171
02:27:21.460 --> 02:27:24.190
<v Speaker 2>but this thing is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When people,</v>

3172
02:27:24.191 --> 02:27:26.650
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>review it when the review and that's</v>

3173
02:27:26.651 --> 02:27:30.280
<v Speaker 2>like you independent canyon going</v>
<v Speaker 2>sideways when that far it was just a</v>

3174
02:27:30.281 --> 02:27:31.120
<v Speaker 2>little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3175
02:27:31.121 --> 02:27:33.370
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to love it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

3176
02:27:33.400 --> 02:27:35.180
<v Speaker 2>that's just long enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3177
02:27:35.320 --> 02:27:37.600
<v Speaker 2>Less than a second is long enough for</v>
<v Speaker 2>fun.</v>

3178
02:27:37.601 --> 02:27:38.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To,</v>

3179
02:27:39.300 --> 02:27:40.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a great road.</v>

3180
02:27:41.200 --> 02:27:42.370
<v Speaker 2>Keep placing more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That shit.</v>

3181
02:27:42.400 --> 02:27:43.380
<v Speaker 2>Don't shut it off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3182
02:27:43.390 --> 02:27:48.130
<v Speaker 2>it's a great road to go to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a road off of um,</v>

3183
02:27:48.250 --> 02:27:51.160
<v Speaker 2>the to chris.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chris.</v>

3184
02:27:51.600 --> 02:27:52.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3185
02:27:52.661 --> 02:27:53.830
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what you're talking about.</v>

3186
02:27:54.010 --> 02:27:54.970
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the name of it.</v>

3187
02:27:55.030 --> 02:28:00.030
<v Speaker 2>It's a road off the two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like if you take the 2:10 and</v>

3188
02:28:00.430 --> 02:28:02.920
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you head towards pasadena and you go up</v>

3189
02:28:02.921 --> 02:28:04.060
<v Speaker 2>into the mountains.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3190
02:28:04.190 --> 02:28:07.360
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this crazy abandoned roads where</v>

3191
02:28:07.361 --> 02:28:10.600
<v Speaker 2>you might not have anybody out there</v>
<v Speaker 2>except maybe like a dude on a motorcycle</v>

3192
02:28:11.010 --> 02:28:12.970
<v Speaker 2>and everything's like turning and</v>
<v Speaker 2>twisty.</v>

3193
02:28:13.120 --> 02:28:15.040
<v Speaker 2>They do a lot of testing out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you go out,</v>

3194
02:28:15.041 --> 02:28:18.740
<v Speaker 2>they'll use like mules,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a car that uh,</v>

3195
02:28:18.850 --> 02:28:21.260
<v Speaker 2>they cover,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they would take this car and then</v>

3196
02:28:21.261 --> 02:28:23.300
<v Speaker 2>they would cover it over with like</v>
<v Speaker 2>graphics,</v>

3197
02:28:23.710 --> 02:28:26.060
<v Speaker 2>even some plastic or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you couldn't tell what it looked</v>

3198
02:28:26.061 --> 02:28:27.080
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen that before.</v>

3199
02:28:27.170 --> 02:28:28.550
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of dope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at that thing.</v>

3200
02:28:28.650 --> 02:28:31.100
<v Speaker 2>Jesus christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3201
02:28:31.101 --> 02:28:33.770

<v Speaker 2>somebody trying to get me to go up to</v>

3202
02:28:33.771 --> 02:28:35.960
<v Speaker 2>the chris highway up there off the two</v>
<v Speaker 2>of them are fun.</v>

3203
02:28:36.050 --> 02:28:37.910
<v Speaker 2>You should go up there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go up there with your card because you</v>

3204
02:28:37.911 --> 02:28:40.190
<v Speaker 2>don't even have to drive fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a good time up there,</v>

3205
02:28:40.250 --> 02:28:43.310
<v Speaker 2>but I don't drive on any of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If there's a car in front of me,</v>

3206
02:28:43.311 --> 02:28:44.970
<v Speaker 2>I might slow up and wait for it to go</v>
<v Speaker 2>by,</v>

3207
02:28:45.350 --> 02:28:47.210
<v Speaker 2>but I'm doing like 40,</v>
<v Speaker 2>40,</v>

3208
02:28:47.450 --> 02:28:48.860
<v Speaker 2>which is a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's down.</v>

3209
02:28:48.920 --> 02:28:53.150
<v Speaker 2>That's downloadable for what'd you post</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do with a car like this?</v>

3210
02:28:53.690 --> 02:28:55.970
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't be doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd be going a lot faster.</v>

3211
02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:58.670
<v Speaker 2>That's the problem with these cars as</v>
<v Speaker 2>opposed to like an old car.</v>

3212
02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:01.370
<v Speaker 2>Like say if you got like an old bmw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

3216
02:29:11.361 --> 02:29:15.110
<v Speaker 2>apparently you feel everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're so small.</v>

3217
02:29:15.310 --> 02:29:17.450
<v Speaker 2>I'll see this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See if you could pull up the smoking</v>

3244
02:30:33.670 --> 02:30:38.670
<v Speaker 5>An interesting because on the one hand</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was sorta bmw's corporate engine at</v>

3245
02:30:39.331 --> 02:30:44.331
<v Speaker 5>the time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it actually the way up to and they</v>

3246
02:30:44.571 --> 02:30:49.571
<v Speaker 5>would use these seasoned m 10 blocks to</v>
<v Speaker 5>build their crazy turbo formula one</v>

3247
02:30:51.421 --> 02:30:55.210
<v Speaker 5>engines and there's a really neat</v>
<v Speaker 5>documentary about the history of</v>

3248
02:30:56.960 --> 02:30:57.760
<v Speaker 5>pedals.</v>

3249

<v Speaker 2>See he's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm saying.</v>

3250
02:30:59.321 --> 02:31:03.880
<v Speaker 2>This is a serious geek when it comes to</v>
<v Speaker 2>cars or really knows his shit though.</v>

3251
02:31:03.940 --> 02:31:07.270
<v Speaker 2>You know what I like when he's in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>car with a person who built the car much</v>

3252
02:31:07.370 --> 02:31:10.090
<v Speaker 2>time and money you put in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to put all this time and his</v>

3253
02:31:10.091 --> 02:31:12.160
<v Speaker 2>money and his energy in it and he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3254
02:31:12.190 --> 02:31:14.630
<v Speaker 2>that's you're not going to find another</v>
<v Speaker 2>car like this.</v>

3255
02:31:14.700 --> 02:31:15.760
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we bought to drive it.</v>

3256
02:31:16.020 --> 02:31:19.030
<v Speaker 2>Then he'll take off like the brakes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little squishy and the suspension</v>

3257
02:31:19.080 --> 02:31:21.240
<v Speaker 2>little off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's got a nice little pull to it.</v>

3258
02:31:21.280 --> 02:31:24.930
<v Speaker 2>Like he just started with this like just</v>
<v Speaker 2>disappeared off the title.</v>

3259
02:31:24.940 --> 02:31:28.310
<v Speaker 2>He is honest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Honest jamie.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I used to drive around downtown and by</v>
<v Speaker 2>nine and see if I can find it at night.</v>

3264

<v Speaker 2>Magnus magnus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3265
02:31:44.970 --> 02:31:48.390
<v Speaker 2>I had the pleasure of meeting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody was trying to get rid of a nine</v>

3266
02:31:48.391 --> 02:31:51.120
<v Speaker 2>to eight and we went over there and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>showed us around.</v>

3267
02:31:51.210 --> 02:31:51.991
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3268
02:31:51.991 --> 02:31:55.220

<v Speaker 2>His place is amazing.</v>

3269
02:31:56.540 --> 02:32:01.200
<v Speaker 2>There's so many old porsches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's got like one,</v>

3270
02:32:01.201 --> 02:32:01.711
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>

3271
02:32:01.711 --> 02:32:02.191
<v Speaker 2>four,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five,</v>

3272
02:32:02.191 --> 02:32:04.560
<v Speaker 2>six.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's probably got at least 10 of them no</v>

3273
02:32:04.730 --> 02:32:08.490
<v Speaker 2>more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I counted like 17 or 17 main room</v>

3274
02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:15.000
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got some more like the 9,009 s nine,</v>

3275
02:32:15.680 --> 02:32:16.513
<v Speaker 2>nine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>14.</v>

3276
02:32:16.570 --> 02:32:18.810
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind a bunch of turbos to quite a</v>

3277
02:32:18.811 --> 02:32:21.270
<v Speaker 2>few turbos now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He really got into a turbo phase where</v>

3278
02:32:21.271 --> 02:32:23.430
<v Speaker 2>he's buying those nine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three zero turbos.</v>

3279
02:32:24.330 --> 02:32:26.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3284
02:32:40.710 --> 02:32:45.710
<v Speaker 2>his car into the back of a giant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks like a car carrier,</v>

3285
02:32:48.660 --> 02:32:51.210
<v Speaker 2>just that's why you're not supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>drive like that.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I saw that.</v>

3307
02:33:48.991 --> 02:33:51.900
<v Speaker 2>The car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that car is so fast,</v>

3308
02:33:52.230 --> 02:33:54.000
<v Speaker 2>it just doesn't even make any sense.</v>

3309
02:34:03.860 --> 02:34:04.693
<v Speaker 6>Downhill</v>

3310
02:34:05.410 --> 02:34:08.890
<v Speaker 2>with the gravity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See he's um,</v>

3311
02:34:09.200 --> 02:34:14.060
<v Speaker 2>he's taken it around some corners here</v>
<v Speaker 2>is actually this exact same road where I</v>

3312
02:34:14.061 --> 02:34:15.900
<v Speaker 2>took it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3313
02:34:15.940 --> 02:34:19.780
<v Speaker 2>I was there at this time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was there with them when they were</v>

3314
02:34:19.781 --> 02:34:22.930
<v Speaker 2>doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this car is too fast.</v>

3315
02:34:23.260 --> 02:34:25.840
<v Speaker 2>It's too fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's not maybe too fast for a</v>

3316
02:34:25.841 --> 02:34:28.480
<v Speaker 2>race car driver,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but too fast for a guy like me because</v>

3317
02:34:28.481 --> 02:34:30.940
<v Speaker 2>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't like one of the cool things</v>

3318
02:34:30.941 --> 02:34:34.510
<v Speaker 2>about like that 2002.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As you get to ring the engine out,</v>

3319
02:34:34.511 --> 02:34:38.260
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of range where you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>drive your rev it up and that's where</v>

3320
02:34:38.261 --> 02:34:41.410
<v Speaker 2>you get your power and you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can go plenty fast than it.</v>

3321
02:34:42.030 --> 02:34:45.370
<v Speaker 2>The handling of those cars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of times it's connected to the</v>

3322
02:34:45.371 --> 02:34:49.060
<v Speaker 2>lightness and the whole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the feel of the car is coming from</v>

3323
02:34:49.061 --> 02:34:50.830
<v Speaker 2>the fact that it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's not a lot there.</v>

3324
02:34:51.280 --> 02:34:53.650
<v Speaker 2>This car is a totally different</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>

3325
02:34:53.830 --> 02:34:58.480
<v Speaker 2>This car is like all about managing the</v>
<v Speaker 2>pedal because if you stomp on the pedal,</v>

3326
02:34:58.530 --> 02:35:02.530
<v Speaker 2>that fucking thing is going spinning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's way too powerful,</v>

3327
02:35:04.150 --> 02:35:06.370
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one of those things where they keep</v>

3328
02:35:06.371 --> 02:35:09.730
<v Speaker 2>coming up with new and improved cars</v>
<v Speaker 2>every year.</v>

3329
02:35:09.760 --> 02:35:12.100
<v Speaker 2>Every year cars get faster and faster</v>
<v Speaker 2>and faster.</v>

3330
02:35:12.101 --> 02:35:15.580
<v Speaker 2>Especially performance cars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've broken the three second barrier.</v>

3331
02:35:16.240 --> 02:35:20.320
<v Speaker 2>A lot of cars you could buy today goes</v>
<v Speaker 2>zero to 60 in less than three seconds</v>

3332
02:35:20.330 --> 02:35:21.940
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a gang of them.</v>

3333
02:35:22.090 --> 02:35:24.340
<v Speaker 2>I want to drive with gotti.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>

3334
02:35:24.341 --> 02:35:27.790
<v Speaker 2>Was I going to sit in one?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do not drive it with just sitting there.</v>

3335
02:35:27.850 --> 02:35:29.770
<v Speaker 2>That might as well be a spaceship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

3336
02:35:29.771 --> 02:35:31.330
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those neurons.</v>

3337
02:35:31.780 --> 02:35:33.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are ridiculous.</v>

3338
02:35:33.460 --> 02:35:35.410
<v Speaker 2>The um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3339
02:35:35.420 --> 02:35:38.590
<v Speaker 2>My homeboy he built,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he built this 69 shelby.</v>

3340
02:35:39.340 --> 02:35:44.340
<v Speaker 2>The 68 got damaged so the insurance had</v>
<v Speaker 2>to cut them a check and he spent that</v>

3341
02:35:45.401 --> 02:35:50.401
<v Speaker 2>money and built a 69,</v>
<v Speaker 2>69 that I haven't drove and he don't</v>

3342
02:35:50.891 --> 02:35:53.350
<v Speaker 2>drive it as much because it's worth a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of money.</v>

3343
02:35:53.490 --> 02:35:55.690
<v Speaker 2>Look at that 1000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>200 horsepower.</v>

3344
02:35:55.720 --> 02:35:57.580
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's ridiculous.</v>

3345
02:35:58.120 --> 02:36:01.060
<v Speaker 2>That's a ridiculous car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw one of those the other day in</v>

<v Speaker 2>which is really interesting.</v>

<v Speaker 1>doing this,</v>

3377
02:37:40.370 --> 02:37:42.710
<v Speaker 1>the neighbors are aware of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they start</v>

<v Speaker 1>everybody's afraid of the irs,</v>

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>in the bushes.</v>

3437
02:40:26.520 --> 02:40:29.670
<v Speaker 1>And I remember looking at him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes it's fun having your face</v>

3438
02:40:29.671 --> 02:40:31.800
<v Speaker 1>in the bush.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I smiled and he was just like,</v>

3439
02:40:32.670 --> 02:40:33.630
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just step away.</v>

3440
02:40:34.630 --> 02:40:37.140
<v Speaker 1>They</v>

<v Speaker 1>They don't know what kind of crazy shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing.</v>

3445
02:40:44.821 --> 02:40:45.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

3471
02:41:34.360 --> 02:41:35.660
<v Speaker 1>Tell you it's is true stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I moved in,</v>

3472
02:41:35.661 --> 02:41:37.870
<v Speaker 1>I had a honda prelude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put a time of building it.</v>

3473
02:41:38.340 --> 02:41:41.460
<v Speaker 1>Fourth generation drove here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to get pulled over all the time.</v>

3474
02:41:41.461 --> 02:41:43.010
<v Speaker 1>Black on black.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3475
02:41:43.180 --> 02:41:47.400
<v Speaker 1>I lived in inglewood and I realized like</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time I get my car search put in</v>

3476
02:41:47.401 --> 02:41:51.990
<v Speaker 1>the back of police cars and I talked to</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cop and he told me about proximity and</v>

3477
02:41:51.991 --> 02:41:55.740
<v Speaker 1>how criminals operate and when they wake</v>
<v Speaker 1>up they get descriptions in the morning</v>

3478
02:41:55.741 --> 02:41:58.890
<v Speaker 1>and if you fit that description they</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to profile you and that's when I</v>

3479
02:41:58.891 --> 02:41:59.521
<v Speaker 1>realized like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3480
02:41:59.521 --> 02:42:01.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm living in the wrong neighborhood</v>
<v Speaker 1>driving the wrong vehicle.</v>

3481
02:42:02.190 --> 02:42:05.460
<v Speaker 1>So when I got denied for four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get what I call corporate old white</v>

3482
02:42:05.461 --> 02:42:10.461
<v Speaker 1>man colors that champagne or that boring</v>
<v Speaker 1>gray and I just drive and now I have</v>

3483
02:42:11.400 --> 02:42:13.290
<v Speaker 1>really no problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

3484
02:42:14.220 --> 02:42:15.370
<v Speaker 1>That's what I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing.</v>

3485
02:42:15.371 --> 02:42:18.930
<v Speaker 1>It's like how my mind works sometimes to</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out that pattern and be like,</v>

3486
02:42:18.931 --> 02:42:21.720
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what it's getting pulled over</v>

3487
02:42:21.721 --> 02:42:22.830
<v Speaker 1>and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I need to,</v>

3488
02:42:23.570 --> 02:42:26.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's the survival in</v>

3489
02:42:26.011 --> 02:42:29.040
<v Speaker 1>your way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like I have to shift and some</v>

3490
02:42:29.041 --> 02:42:30.150
<v Speaker 1>people real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>

3491
02:42:30.151 --> 02:42:31.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel like I should shift like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

3492
02:42:32.010 --> 02:42:34.590
<v Speaker 1>but I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3493
02:42:35.160 --> 02:42:36.630
<v Speaker 1>the cops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cops will be like,</v>

3494
02:42:36.631 --> 02:42:39.030
<v Speaker 1>slow down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've messed up in the.</v>

3495
02:42:39.031 --> 02:42:41.940
<v Speaker 1>I was doing 60 on franklin one time just</v>
<v Speaker 1>enjoying my life</v>

3496
02:42:44.340 --> 02:42:46.590
<v Speaker 1>because white women jogging and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything and the street.</v>

3497
02:42:46.591 --> 02:42:47.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this ain't bad,</v>

3498
02:42:47.550 --> 02:42:48.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>life is great.</v>

3499
02:42:48.421 --> 02:42:50.400
<v Speaker 1>I tell jokes and the cops were just</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3500

<v Speaker 1>you slow down.</v>

3501
02:42:51.361 --> 02:42:52.810
<v Speaker 1>And I remember putting my hand out the</v>
<v Speaker 1>window,</v>

3502
02:42:52.811 --> 02:42:57.060
<v Speaker 1>like no problem officer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then that was it and I was like,</v>

3503
02:42:57.061 --> 02:42:59.990
<v Speaker 1>this is amazing right here.</v>

3504
02:43:03.690 --> 02:43:06.450
<v Speaker 1>But I also experienced another white</v>
<v Speaker 1>privilege thing when I had an.</v>

3505
02:43:06.460 --> 02:43:08.480
<v Speaker 1>I had an accident in the nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>

3506
02:43:08.481 --> 02:43:11.650
<v Speaker 1>four and it was a latino people and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy got out of the car.</v>

3507
02:43:11.651 --> 02:43:13.900
<v Speaker 1>The cops showed up and I was sitting on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the car,</v>

3508
02:43:14.540 --> 02:43:15.570
<v Speaker 1>the old white guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sir,</v>

3509
02:43:15.580 --> 02:43:16.960
<v Speaker 1>is this your car?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

3510
02:43:16.961 --> 02:43:17.860

<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

3511
02:43:18.430 --> 02:43:19.900
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything is gonna be okay.</v>

3512
02:43:20.410 --> 02:43:23.910
<v Speaker 1>And then he went.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He lit into the mess and people to where</v>

3513
02:43:23.911 --> 02:43:26.440
<v Speaker 1>I got uncomfortable for a while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I almost said something to yelling at</v>

3514
02:43:26.441 --> 02:43:30.910
<v Speaker 1>the mexican people assuming this ain't</v>
<v Speaker 1>regulation and where the paperwork for</v>

3515
02:43:30.911 --> 02:43:33.380
<v Speaker 1>this and asking them all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me see your id.</v>

3516
02:43:33.410 --> 02:43:36.940
<v Speaker 1>When did you get this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And and me coming from Georgia,</v>

3517
02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:38.850
<v Speaker 1>not using.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm used to seeing black people treat</v>

3518
02:43:38.910 --> 02:43:39.880
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no other culture,</v>

3519
02:43:40.190 --> 02:43:42.550
<v Speaker 1>so to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I almost stepped in but something was</v>

3520
02:43:42.551 --> 02:43:45.040
<v Speaker 1>like hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>

3521
02:43:45.480 --> 02:43:49.120
<v Speaker 1>And I swim sitting on the car like damn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling guilty.</v>

3522
02:43:49.121 --> 02:43:51.100
<v Speaker 1>Like this was white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>white guilt feels like,</v>

3523
02:43:52.560 --> 02:43:54.730
<v Speaker 1>but I'm still on the other side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3524
02:43:55.240 --> 02:43:56.770
<v Speaker 1>So I'm just letting it ride.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3525
02:43:58.120 --> 02:44:00.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's funny,</v>

3526
02:44:00.700 --> 02:44:04.030
<v Speaker 1>but like I said before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like when you in that place where</v>

3527
02:44:04.031 --> 02:44:06.010
<v Speaker 1>you see different stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's shapes you.</v>

3528
02:44:06.020 --> 02:44:10.030
<v Speaker 1>Somehow it gets that understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think with a lot of cops,</v>

3529
02:44:10.031 --> 02:44:13.390
<v Speaker 1>something can happen to where they pull</v>
<v Speaker 1>over so many people that are illegal</v>

3530
02:44:13.391 --> 02:44:15.940
<v Speaker 1>immigrants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They start getting upset and start</v>

3531
02:44:15.941 --> 02:44:18.520
<v Speaker 1>getting upset of that and they treat it</v>
<v Speaker 1>like disproportionately.</v>

3532
02:44:19.120 --> 02:44:23.740
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen a lot of fucking people that</v>

3533
02:44:23.741 --> 02:44:26.310
<v Speaker 1>are driving illegally in los angeles</v>
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>

3534
02:44:26.470 --> 02:44:28.690
<v Speaker 1>I got rear ended by a dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

3535
02:44:28.691 --> 02:44:32.800
<v Speaker 1>I remember that there was no driver's</v>
<v Speaker 1>license,</v>

3536
02:44:33.260 --> 02:44:35.230
<v Speaker 1>but I know a lot of white people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>were driving illegally.</v>

3537
02:44:35.270 --> 02:44:36.103
<v Speaker 1>They don't worry about it.</v>

3538
02:44:36.610 --> 02:44:37.900
<v Speaker 1>Nothing happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you do.</v>

3539
02:44:37.901 --> 02:44:40.780
<v Speaker 1>If you get pulled over though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they find that if a cop finds out,</v>

3540
02:44:40.781 --> 02:44:42.700
<v Speaker 1>you're driving illegally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in trouble.</v>

3541
02:44:42.740 --> 02:44:43.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

3542
02:44:43.840 --> 02:44:45.130
<v Speaker 1>Everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter who you are,</v>

3543
02:44:46.450 --> 02:44:48.730
<v Speaker 1>they'll tell your car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the odds are you're getting pulled</v>

3544
02:44:48.731 --> 02:44:51.130
<v Speaker 1>over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of slim.</v>

3545
02:44:51.390 --> 02:44:52.780
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3546
02:44:52.781 --> 02:44:56.230
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The odds are greater if you are black or</v>

3547
02:44:56.231 --> 02:44:57.640
<v Speaker 1>if you're mexican of getting pulled</v>
<v Speaker 1>over.</v>

3548
02:44:57.641 --> 02:44:59.860
<v Speaker 1>I would say that probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely true.</v>

3549
02:44:59.920 --> 02:45:02.110
<v Speaker 1>Cut the me getting out the car like this</v>
<v Speaker 1>and was like,</v>

3550
02:45:02.111 --> 02:45:02.944
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not you.</v>

3551
02:45:03.070 --> 02:45:03.791
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3552
02:45:03.791 --> 02:45:05.560
<v Speaker 1>I was just stretching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

3553
02:45:06.100 --> 02:45:08.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know this,</v>

3554
02:45:09.200 --> 02:45:10.900
<v Speaker 1>it's what it is to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

3555
02:45:11.530 --> 02:45:13.900
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't want to be a fucking cop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh no,</v>

3556
02:45:14.830 --> 02:45:16.110
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think me honestly,</v>

3557
02:45:16.111 --> 02:45:21.111
<v Speaker 1>I think that their job is to nurture to</v>
<v Speaker 1>nerveracking for the regular person.</v>

3558
02:45:21.400 --> 02:45:22.630
<v Speaker 1>And I think so too.</v>

3559
02:45:22.690 --> 02:45:25.780
<v Speaker 1>And they don't make enough money to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>through the mental part of it.</v>

3560
02:45:25.880 --> 02:45:27.610
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To affect their relationships and their</v>

3561
02:45:27.640 --> 02:45:28.473
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Life.</v>

3562
02:45:29.230 --> 02:45:30.870
<v Speaker 1>Suicides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3563
02:45:30.871 --> 02:45:33.610
<v Speaker 1>The cops commit suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lots of cops feel despair.</v>

3564
02:45:34.180 --> 02:45:36.580
<v Speaker 1>It's a crazy job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a crazy job,</v>

3565
02:45:36.670 --> 02:45:37.700
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3566
02:45:38.060 --> 02:45:39.370
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3567
02:45:39.700 --> 02:45:40.580
<v Speaker 1>they got to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>

3568
02:45:40.581 --> 02:45:42.160
<v Speaker 1>I got to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got a reputation.</v>

3569
02:45:42.940 --> 02:45:47.940
<v Speaker 1>Cops have almost a reputation now of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a black man to act like they,</v>

3570
02:45:49.811 --> 02:45:51.940
<v Speaker 1>like people look at them like prejudice</v>
<v Speaker 1>against.</v>

3571
02:45:52.150 --> 02:45:53.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

3572
02:45:53.441 --> 02:45:54.820
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me it's like,</v>

3573
02:45:54.821 --> 02:45:56.070
<v Speaker 1>oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>truths.</v>

3574
02:45:56.071 --> 02:45:57.590
<v Speaker 1>Ironic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3575
02:45:57.600 --> 02:46:02.440
<v Speaker 1>and they have to go in those situations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have to go to the hood with that</v>

3576
02:46:02.441 --> 02:46:03.460
<v Speaker 1>reputation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

3577
02:46:03.840 --> 02:46:06.640
<v Speaker 1>And that's outfit on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a scary thing.</v>

3578
02:46:06.820 --> 02:46:08.950
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If your outfit is being represented by</v>

3579
02:46:08.960 --> 02:46:11.630
<v Speaker 1>people that do and fucked up things like</v>
<v Speaker 1>those videos that we were talking about</v>

3580
02:46:11.631 --> 02:46:13.010
<v Speaker 1>earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's your outfit,</v>

3581
02:46:13.040 --> 02:46:14.030
<v Speaker 1>that's the team you're on.</v>

3582
02:46:14.450 --> 02:46:17.860
<v Speaker 1>So you have to go and you know that</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people are gonna see you and</v>

3583
02:46:17.861 --> 02:46:20.240
<v Speaker 1>looking at you and know that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>represent that team,</v>

3584
02:46:20.470 --> 02:46:21.860
<v Speaker 1>that they've been watching all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>videos.</v>

3585
02:46:22.280 --> 02:46:25.760
<v Speaker 1>And I'm from a place where the cops</v>
<v Speaker 1>looked like said the cops,</v>

3586
02:46:25.761 --> 02:46:28.710
<v Speaker 1>they treated you fucked up like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3587
02:46:28.820 --> 02:46:31.500
<v Speaker 1>they were dirty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a different ballgame.</v>

3588
02:46:31.550 --> 02:46:32.730
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3589
02:46:33.510 --> 02:46:35.660
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's what it is.</v>

3590
02:46:35.690 --> 02:46:40.690
<v Speaker 1>It's so much that isn't understood</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside of the videos that are being.</v>

3591
02:46:41.210 --> 02:46:45.380
<v Speaker 1>Do you think there's a way on stage that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can relay a lot of this stuff that</v>

3592
02:46:45.381 --> 02:46:47.960
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say I feel like,</v>

3593
02:46:47.961 --> 02:46:49.760
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you could figure out a way to make</v>

3594
02:46:49.761 --> 02:46:54.320
<v Speaker 1>humor out of the difference between your</v>
<v Speaker 1>background growing up and what you're</v>

3595
02:46:54.321 --> 02:46:59.321
<v Speaker 1>experiencing now and you just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're on your own unique perspective.</v>

3596
02:47:01.310 --> 02:47:01.881
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking,</v>

3597
02:47:01.881 --> 02:47:03.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm slowly talking about it.</v>

3598
02:47:03.180 --> 02:47:04.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can ask.</v>

3599
02:47:04.400 --> 02:47:05.800
<v Speaker 1>Touch.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I walk on stage and be like,</v>

3602
02:47:13.740 --> 02:47:15.170
<v Speaker 1>shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just 30 seconds.</v>

3603
02:47:15.171 --> 02:47:17.690
<v Speaker 1>I will get applause break in 30 seconds</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the,</v>

3604
02:47:17.810 --> 02:47:21.470
<v Speaker 1>at the tense time or that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by that I'm telling them,</v>

3605
02:47:21.890 --> 02:47:26.750
<v Speaker 1>I explained the story of the protests</v>
<v Speaker 1>when traffic is being held up and I'm</v>

3606
02:47:26.751 --> 02:47:28.820
<v Speaker 1>driving with my gas light on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this don't if this,</v>

<v Speaker 1>my car dies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a hostage in a situation I don't</v>

3609
02:47:34.011 --> 02:47:36.860
<v Speaker 1>want to be in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then feeling sorry for that black</v>

3610
02:47:36.870 --> 02:47:40.460
<v Speaker 1>guy who's stuck in traffic and don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know why.</v>

3611
02:47:40.620 --> 02:47:44.300
<v Speaker 1>And every white person looking at him</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he liked this ain't got nothing to</v>

3612
02:47:44.301 --> 02:47:46.830
<v Speaker 1>do with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just on my way to owners counties.</v>

3613
02:47:46.850 --> 02:47:47.840
<v Speaker 1>I can fuck this white girl.</v>

3614
02:47:49.580 --> 02:47:52.190
<v Speaker 1>That was the bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all of it's based on truth.</v>

3615
02:47:53.210 --> 02:47:54.740
<v Speaker 1>But you know what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on truth,</v>

3616
02:47:54.950 --> 02:47:57.950
<v Speaker 1>I felt like when those black lives</v>
<v Speaker 1>matter protesters were shutting down</v>

3617
02:47:57.951 --> 02:48:00.140
<v Speaker 1>highways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like fucking white people.</v>

3618
02:48:00.320 --> 02:48:02.480
<v Speaker 1>It was white people that are trying too</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard to be dealt with.</v>

3619
02:48:02.481 --> 02:48:05.030
<v Speaker 1>Black lives matters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they took it to the highway and shut</v>

3620
02:48:05.031 --> 02:48:08.000
<v Speaker 1>down the highway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I knew this one dude is like a super,</v>

3621
02:48:08.001 --> 02:48:11.690
<v Speaker 1>super lefty guy and he uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a part of the black lives matter</v>

3622
02:48:11.691 --> 02:48:16.691
<v Speaker 1>shutting down highways and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing man out in berkeley?</v>

3623
02:48:17.980 --> 02:48:19.340
<v Speaker 1>But super,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super liberal,</v>

3624
02:48:19.341 --> 02:48:22.130
<v Speaker 1>crazy people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a hierarchy of black people just</v>

3625
02:48:22.131 --> 02:48:25.220
<v Speaker 1>like a of white people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And me and jim martin neighbors,</v>

3626
02:48:25.221 --> 02:48:29.010
<v Speaker 1>we say some shit like real niggas don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>give a fuck about black issues.</v>

3627
02:48:30.210 --> 02:48:32.300
<v Speaker 1>It's just true because their survival</v>
<v Speaker 1>mode,</v>

3628
02:48:33.070 --> 02:48:33.950
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

3629
02:48:34.480 --> 02:48:35.810
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so things like,</v>

3630
02:48:35.811 --> 02:48:38.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>education and shit like that don't</v>

3631
02:48:38.541 --> 02:48:42.480
<v Speaker 1>really matter who leaving to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't talk about politics going on.</v>

3632
02:48:42.500 --> 02:48:45.500
<v Speaker 1>So I really don't care about politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how I feel about it.</v>

3633
02:48:45.501 --> 02:48:50.030
<v Speaker 1>Like I still got to grind either way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you care at all?</v>

3634
02:48:50.120 --> 02:48:51.950
<v Speaker 1>Like when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're looking at hillary clinton</v>

3635
02:48:51.951 --> 02:48:53.440
<v Speaker 1>and Donald Trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what's your thought?</v>

3636
02:48:53.480 --> 02:48:55.160
<v Speaker 1>You just don't think about things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

3637
02:48:55.290 --> 02:48:57.980
<v Speaker 1>and I said this before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before everything got crazy.</v>

3638
02:48:57.981 --> 02:48:59.910
<v Speaker 1>Trump got crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3639
02:49:00.140 --> 02:49:03.710
<v Speaker 1>I understand sometimes where he's coming</v>
<v Speaker 1>from through educational purposes.</v>

3640
02:49:03.711 --> 02:49:05.930
<v Speaker 1>I understand republican mindset,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

3641
02:49:06.960 --> 02:49:08.280
<v Speaker 1>Because that was taught to export</v>

3642
02:49:08.280 --> 02:49:10.200
<v Speaker 2>businesses and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3643
02:49:10.201 --> 02:49:12.570
<v Speaker 2>all that makes sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I don't think.</v>

3644
02:49:12.840 --> 02:49:17.840
<v Speaker 2>I think this part is for ratings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see it as a show and I think,</v>

3645
02:49:18.150 --> 02:49:21.130
<v Speaker 2>I think trump is like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3646
02:49:21.270 --> 02:49:23.340
<v Speaker 2>a character.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3647
02:49:23.370 --> 02:49:25.500
<v Speaker 2>definitely they want everybody to vote</v>
<v Speaker 2>for hillary.</v>

3648
02:49:26.100 --> 02:49:27.660
<v Speaker 2>I think they're gonna lead people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

3649
02:49:27.661 --> 02:49:31.430
<v Speaker 2>like you leave water to go down a</v>
<v Speaker 2>certain ravine and then hillary is gonna</v>

3650
02:49:31.450 --> 02:49:35.280
<v Speaker 2>make a because their personality and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>best,</v>

3651
02:49:35.310 --> 02:49:37.170
<v Speaker 2>like it ain't like a barack obama people</v>
<v Speaker 2>be like,</v>

3652
02:49:37.171 --> 02:49:38.190

<v Speaker 2>like this lady.</v>

3653
02:49:38.700 --> 02:49:41.820
<v Speaker 2>But I think once you get in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she'd been to kind of personnel is</v>

3654
02:49:41.940 --> 02:49:43.230
<v Speaker 2>terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3655
02:49:43.310 --> 02:49:45.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think she's going to make some</v>

3656
02:49:45.631 --> 02:49:48.660
<v Speaker 2>adjustments on the low that's going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>really fuck up people.</v>

3657
02:49:48.661 --> 02:49:51.950
<v Speaker 2>She does things that make me super</v>
<v Speaker 2>nervous to sing.</v>

3658
02:49:52.160 --> 02:49:55.440
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever see the video of her?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was she was talking about uh,</v>

3659
02:49:55.850 --> 02:49:56.780
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gaddafi.</v>

3660
02:49:57.610 --> 02:49:58.310
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's,</v>

3661
02:49:58.310 --> 02:50:00.600
<v Speaker 2>she was laughing about how uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>

3662
02:50:00.630 --> 02:50:05.550
<v Speaker 2>I think she says we came,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we saw he died and it was like off</v>

3663
02:50:05.551 --> 02:50:08.370
<v Speaker 2>camera and like she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think she realized that she was</v>

3664
02:50:08.371 --> 02:50:12.570
<v Speaker 2>being filmed or this is just not her</v>
<v Speaker 2>behaving like I'm gonna play it for you.</v>

3665
02:50:13.810 --> 02:50:17.000
<v Speaker 7>This came,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we saw he died.</v>

3666

<v Speaker 7>we came,</v>

3667
02:50:19.850 --> 02:50:23.210
<v Speaker 7>we saw he died.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What</v>

3668
02:50:23.210 --> 02:50:27.350
<v Speaker 2>is basically she's also looking off at</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone else,</v>

3669
02:50:27.440 --> 02:50:30.950
<v Speaker 2>like for their approval when looking at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the woman she's talking to necessarily.</v>

3670
02:50:31.430 --> 02:50:34.940
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's so weird thing to joke about,</v>

3671
02:50:34.970 --> 02:50:39.970
<v Speaker 2>the enormity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the magnitude of assassinating a foreign</v>

3672
02:50:40.071 --> 02:50:42.380
<v Speaker 2>leader,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether he's a dictator,</v>

3673
02:50:42.410 --> 02:50:45.590
<v Speaker 2>dictator or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's a lot going on there you</v>

3674
02:50:45.591 --> 02:50:49.730
<v Speaker 2>are overthrowing the ruler of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>government even though it was a terrible</v>

3675
02:50:49.760 --> 02:50:54.760

3677
02:50:59.570 --> 02:51:01.910
<v Speaker 2>of establishing a new leader.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

3678
02:51:01.940 --> 02:51:05.720
<v Speaker 2>And that's where it is right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you see someone who is running</v>

3679
02:51:05.721 --> 02:51:10.721
<v Speaker 2>for president and they are joking around</v>
<v Speaker 2>about a scenario that has taken place</v>

3680
02:51:11.031 --> 02:51:12.800

<v Speaker 2>she was a part of.</v>

3681
02:51:13.070 --> 02:51:18.070

<v Speaker 2>connected to horrific tragedies and this</v>

3699
02:52:04.030 --> 02:52:05.230
<v Speaker 2>and I'm thinking that's going to happen</v>
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

02:52:06.100 --> 02:52:10.840
<v Speaker 1>where the public has a curfew for women</v>
<v Speaker 1>at a certain time and they will.</v>

<v Speaker 1>powerful people like and poor people.</v>

3714
02:52:43.750 --> 02:52:46.890

<v Speaker 1>fuck the people in the middle of all the</v>

<v Speaker 1>Just like guys I met,</v>

3718
02:52:55.621 --> 02:52:58.660
<v Speaker 1>we talked about man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shot three times,</v>

3719
02:52:58.661 --> 02:53:00.270
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shot the first time they go through,</v>

3720

<v Speaker 1>And the gun jammed.</v>

3722
02:53:03.730 --> 02:53:06.310
<v Speaker 1>I got nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like these are the stories.</v>

3723
02:53:06.670 --> 02:53:10.500
<v Speaker 1>So I had the ability to sit with both</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just the,</v>

3724
02:53:10.800 --> 02:53:12.040
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it ain't,</v>

3725
02:53:12.100 --> 02:53:14.110
<v Speaker 1>it ain't my comedy is based off this</v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

3726
02:53:14.111 --> 02:53:17.230
<v Speaker 1>So I got to be like one of these people</v>
<v Speaker 1>to talking to some of these murders,</v>

3727
02:53:17.231 --> 02:53:19.360
<v Speaker 1>someone with a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's laughing and joking around about</v>

3728
02:53:19.361 --> 02:53:20.380
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be fucked up,</v>

3729
02:53:20.410 --> 02:53:22.960
<v Speaker 1>but it's like this guy didn't die but he</v>
<v Speaker 1>did get hit,</v>

3730
02:53:23.050 --> 02:53:26.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you hear it's like somebody telling</v>

3731
02:53:26.860 --> 02:53:30.610
<v Speaker 1>his story and they tell him how bad it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was because you know,</v>

3732
02:53:30.611 --> 02:53:33.160
<v Speaker 1>they live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they live it and it was over something</v>

3733
02:53:33.161 --> 02:53:33.550
<v Speaker 1>simple.</v>

3734
02:53:33.550 --> 02:53:37.150
<v Speaker 1>Like I told you next time I see you that</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was going to go down,</v>

3735
02:53:37.180 --> 02:53:40.270
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it just went down,</v>

3736
02:53:40.420 --> 02:53:42.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>over something simple.</v>

3737
02:53:42.281 --> 02:53:46.750
<v Speaker 1>But I always say like the people like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that at the top when people at the</v>

3738
02:53:46.751 --> 02:53:51.310
<v Speaker 1>bottom don't give a fuck and that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you look at the politics and now</v>

3739
02:53:51.311 --> 02:53:55.300
<v Speaker 1>you got trump and you got to support it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The redneck shit that people say they</v>

3740
02:53:55.301 --> 02:53:59.170
<v Speaker 1>don't like those top and bottom people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that pattern wise.</v>

3741
02:53:59.790 --> 02:54:01.460
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think yeah,</v>

3742
02:54:01.480 --> 02:54:03.320
<v Speaker 1>hillary get in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're trying to lose everybody</v>

3743
02:54:03.330 --> 02:54:06.730
<v Speaker 1>the whole way and then she's gone on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>low side,</v>

3744
02:54:06.731 --> 02:54:09.370
<v Speaker 1>some document that's really gonna fuck</v>
<v Speaker 1>people up down the line.</v>

3745
02:54:09.820 --> 02:54:12.160
<v Speaker 1>Those are my predictions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you think she's going to do that?</v>

3746
02:54:12.280 --> 02:54:13.630
<v Speaker 1>You know how you find that outfit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

3747
02:54:13.631 --> 02:54:14.770
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you found out later on?</v>

3748
02:54:14.770 --> 02:54:15.610
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh man,</v>

3749
02:54:15.700 --> 02:54:17.650
<v Speaker 1>that document,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that president signed three years ago.</v>

3750
02:54:17.651 --> 02:54:18.950
<v Speaker 1>Fuck people up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3751
02:54:19.030 --> 02:54:20.170
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

3752
02:54:20.230 --> 02:54:21.280
<v Speaker 1>It was a lot of the us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3753
02:54:21.310 --> 02:54:23.170
<v Speaker 1>So I think it's going to be something</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

3754
02:54:23.670 --> 02:54:26.290
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's gotten away with so much already.</v>

3755
02:54:26.320 --> 02:54:28.690
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's gotten away with so much already.</v>

3756
02:54:28.870 --> 02:54:32.740
<v Speaker 1>The idea that she's gonna stop once you</v>
<v Speaker 1>get to the office is ridiculous because</v>

3757
02:54:32.741 --> 02:54:36.040
<v Speaker 1>she broke so many fucking laws where</v>
<v Speaker 1>their email server,</v>

3758
02:54:36.280 --> 02:54:40.690
<v Speaker 1>all the lies that she told about bengazi</v>
<v Speaker 1>all throughout her career.</v>

3759
02:54:40.691 --> 02:54:43.240
<v Speaker 1>There's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's many websites document all the</v>

3760
02:54:43.270 --> 02:54:45.160
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've caught her lying about like</v>

3761
02:54:45.161 --> 02:54:48.040
<v Speaker 1>pretty important issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that she's going to stop doing</v>

3762
02:54:48.041 --> 02:54:49.840
<v Speaker 1>that once she becomes president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

3763
02:54:49.841 --> 02:54:52.990
<v Speaker 1>She's gotten away with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She lies when she talks about getting</v>

3764
02:54:52.991 --> 02:54:56.380
<v Speaker 1>caught in lies like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You talked about the fbi.</v>

3765
02:54:57.620 --> 02:55:01.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm having this long interview with her</v>
<v Speaker 1>about her email server.</v>

3766
02:55:01.960 --> 02:55:04.370
<v Speaker 1>There's a direct video</v>

3767
02:55:04.370 --> 02:55:09.370
<v Speaker 4>that shows like the direct comparison</v>
<v Speaker 4>between what she said and what he said,</v>

3768
02:55:09.650 --> 02:55:11.900
<v Speaker 4>what she said and when he said it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>horrible.</v>

3769
02:55:11.960 --> 02:55:15.740
<v Speaker 4>It's horrible to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like how is this person even qualified</v>

3770
02:55:15.770 --> 02:55:17.930
<v Speaker 4>to run for office?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Forget about the fact that everybody</v>

3771
02:55:17.931 --> 02:55:20.600
<v Speaker 4>wants a woman to be the the new</v>
<v Speaker 4>president.</v>

3772
02:55:20.601 --> 02:55:21.600
<v Speaker 4>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3773
02:55:21.601 --> 02:55:23.420
<v Speaker 4>That'd be fun for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3774
02:55:23.421 --> 02:55:24.440
<v Speaker 4>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's do this.</v>

3775
02:55:24.730 --> 02:55:28.120
<v Speaker 2>The one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six months to that new car smell gone,</v>

3776
02:55:28.500 --> 02:55:29.860
<v Speaker 2>but this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's not the one.</v>

3777
02:55:29.920 --> 02:55:31.570
<v Speaker 2>This is not the one you don't want.</v>

3778
02:55:31.920 --> 02:55:33.810
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the only thing good is that she's a</v>

3779
02:55:33.811 --> 02:55:36.570
<v Speaker 4>longterm politician,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so she understands the business.</v>

3780
02:55:36.780 --> 02:55:39.660
<v Speaker 4>The only thing bad is that she's a</v>
<v Speaker 4>longterm politician.</v>

3781
02:55:39.661 --> 02:55:41.990
<v Speaker 4>She knows the business.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the both things.</v>

3782
02:55:42.430 --> 02:55:46.630
<v Speaker 2>She knows the business sucks and people</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't understand it as a business.</v>

3783
02:55:47.050 --> 02:55:48.850
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are mostly caught up in it.</v>

3784
02:55:49.110 --> 02:55:51.040
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I definitely think,</v>

3785
02:55:51.330 --> 02:55:55.840
<v Speaker 2>I think people like we all should,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could find a better way to do things</v>

3786
02:55:55.841 --> 02:55:58.390
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm hoping and not put power and like</v>

3787
02:55:58.391 --> 02:56:01.600
<v Speaker 2>church and government and these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just hard.</v>

3788
02:56:01.630 --> 02:56:03.470
<v Speaker 2>It's got such a stranglehold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3789
02:56:03.640 --> 02:56:08.050
<v Speaker 2>The idea that you have to register as</v>
<v Speaker 2>either a democrat or republican to vote</v>

3790
02:56:08.051 --> 02:56:11.110
<v Speaker 2>in the primaries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the primaries decide which candidate is</v>

3791
02:56:11.111 --> 02:56:14.880
<v Speaker 2>going to represent these parties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a show rate.</v>

3792
02:56:14.920 --> 02:56:17.230
<v Speaker 2>It's never been more obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's a charade.</v>

3793
02:56:17.231 --> 02:56:21.200
<v Speaker 2>And I fully never learned learned it</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I look at the bigger picture and</v>

3794
02:56:21.201 --> 02:56:22.034
<v Speaker 2>the pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

3795
02:56:22.600 --> 02:56:24.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3796
02:56:24.710 --> 02:56:26.000
<v Speaker 2>well byron,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to come back</v>

3797
02:56:26.110 --> 02:56:29.530
<v Speaker 4>four years and we'll see if you're right</v>
<v Speaker 4>about hillary clinton if she fucked up</v>

3798
02:56:29.531 --> 02:56:31.120
<v Speaker 4>because you don't remember just a little</v>
<v Speaker 4>while ago,</v>

3799
02:56:31.121 --> 02:56:32.630
<v Speaker 4>everybody was saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

3800
02:56:32.700 --> 02:56:33.790
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hillary clinton,</v>

3801
02:56:33.791 --> 02:56:37.930
<v Speaker 4>that the fbi was going to drop some</v>
<v Speaker 4>bombshell and that more information was</v>

3802
02:56:37.931 --> 02:56:40.570
<v Speaker 4>going to come out about the horrible</v>
<v Speaker 4>things that she's involved with and</v>

3803
02:56:40.571 --> 02:56:43.660
<v Speaker 4>she's done and then she's going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>probably be indicted and then she's</v>

3804
02:56:43.661 --> 02:56:46.240
<v Speaker 4>gonna wind up pulling out and she's not</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to be running for president.</v>

3805
02:56:46.250 --> 02:56:49.390
<v Speaker 4>That was like the big rumors just a few</v>
<v Speaker 4>months ago now.</v>

3806
02:56:49.660 --> 02:56:54.550
<v Speaker 4>Trump has gotten so fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's done so much stupid shit and said</v>

3807
02:56:54.551 --> 02:56:55.900
<v Speaker 4>so much stupid shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then now,</v>

3808
02:56:55.901 --> 02:57:00.550
<v Speaker 4>like the harvard republican club for the</v>
<v Speaker 4>first time in over a hundred years is</v>

3809
02:57:00.551 --> 02:57:03.130
<v Speaker 4>coming out against the nominee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

3810
02:57:03.450 --> 02:57:07.210
<v Speaker 4>there's like a bunch of different</v>
<v Speaker 4>prominent politicians that have come out</v>

3811
02:57:07.211 --> 02:57:09.130
<v Speaker 4>against him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you don't remember that.</v>

3812
02:57:09.460 --> 02:57:12.460
<v Speaker 4>Usually by the time someone gets to a</v>
<v Speaker 4>point where they're running for</v>

3813
02:57:12.461 --> 02:57:15.790
<v Speaker 4>president,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the republican nominee with mitt romney</v>

3814
02:57:15.791 --> 02:57:18.550
<v Speaker 4>or anyone else,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like they're kind of embraced,</v>

3815
02:57:18.610 --> 02:57:19.001
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3816
02:57:19.001 --> 02:57:20.350
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've got the nominee,</v>

3817
02:57:20.380 --> 02:57:22.360
<v Speaker 4>everything's in order,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's move forward.</v>

3818
02:57:22.510 --> 02:57:26.710
<v Speaker 4>That's not happening now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even even with the election just a</v>

3819
02:57:26.710 --> 02:57:28.640
<v Speaker 4>couple of months away,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people were freaking out and they got to</v>

3820
02:57:28.641 --> 02:57:30.160
<v Speaker 4>go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can't have this guy,</v>

3821
02:57:30.460 --> 02:57:31.660
<v Speaker 4>this guy can't be our guy.</v>

3822
02:57:32.370 --> 02:57:33.480
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happened in dr.</v>

3823
02:57:34.240 --> 02:57:36.690
<v Speaker 2>They got a lady,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3824
02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:40.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm in charge and it was some sneaky</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that,</v>

3825
02:57:40.201 --> 02:57:43.590
<v Speaker 2>but when she got here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she started doing the curfews and she</v>

3826
02:57:43.591 --> 02:57:46.010
<v Speaker 2>took the haitians and kicked them out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3827
02:57:46.020 --> 02:57:48.000
<v Speaker 2>she gave him to be fair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was like,</v>

3828
02:57:48.001 --> 02:57:50.650
<v Speaker 2>you got this amount of money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can stay a haitian church.</v>

3829
02:57:50.760 --> 02:57:51.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it got in.</v>

3830
02:57:51.980 --> 02:57:55.740
<v Speaker 2>God was showing me scars that allowed</v>
<v Speaker 2>them to stay into in the dr.</v>

3831
02:57:56.070 --> 02:57:59.040
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it got real for me over there because I</v>

3832
02:57:59.940 --> 02:58:01.710
<v Speaker 2>finally talk to</v>

3833
02:58:02.050 --> 02:58:06.000
<v Speaker 1>these dudes that used to be kids asked</v>
<v Speaker 1>for money and now they adults asking for</v>

3834
02:58:06.001 --> 02:58:07.590
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on?</v>

3835
02:58:07.960 --> 02:58:10.650
<v Speaker 1>And they started breaking it down like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3836
02:58:10.651 --> 02:58:12.600
<v Speaker 1>let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A group of people just like kicked out</v>

3837
02:58:12.601 --> 02:58:14.520
<v Speaker 1>of a country like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

3838
02:58:14.521 --> 02:58:15.354
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe we,</v>

3839
02:58:15.360 --> 02:58:18.480
<v Speaker 1>maybe we should be glad we're lost tribe</v>
<v Speaker 1>that could easily be,</v>

3840
02:58:19.350 --> 02:58:22.320
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it could always be worse for sure.</v>

3841
02:58:22.350 --> 02:58:22.801
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3842
02:58:22.801 --> 02:58:25.410
<v Speaker 4>And they look up to us and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3843
02:58:25.450 --> 02:58:27.220
<v Speaker 4>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>regardless of what's happening,</v>

3844
02:58:27.230 --> 02:58:29.580
<v Speaker 4>and I know this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know black people getting killed by</v>

3845
02:58:29.581 --> 02:58:32.070
<v Speaker 4>the cops,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you still got a chance to be</v>

3846
02:58:32.071 --> 02:58:36.100
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I couldn't even say nothing like me</v>

3847
02:58:36.101 --> 02:58:40.320
<v Speaker 4>while North Korea looks up to them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>North Korea,</v>

3848
02:58:40.500 --> 02:58:42.420
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at least they don't have to deal with</v>

3849
02:58:42.421 --> 02:58:45.990
<v Speaker 4>dear leader.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't have to cry for hours and</v>

3850
02:58:45.990 --> 02:58:48.240
<v Speaker 4>hours when his dad died,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they don't cry correctly,</v>

3851
02:58:48.241 --> 02:58:51.600
<v Speaker 4>they get put in jail for six months and</v>
<v Speaker 4>forced to work in labor camps.</v>

3852
02:58:52.040 --> 02:58:54.570
<v Speaker 4>They have labor camps in North Korea</v>
<v Speaker 4>where people are literally starving to</v>

3853
02:58:54.571 --> 02:58:56.580
<v Speaker 4>death when they sick dogs on them and</v>
<v Speaker 4>the dogs eat them.</v>

3854
02:58:57.070 --> 02:58:59.100
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is game of thrones type shit and</v>

3855
02:58:59.101 --> 02:59:00.330
