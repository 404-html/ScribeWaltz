<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

37
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.840
<v Speaker 1>and I was interested in it because I'd done a little bit of acting up until</v>

38
00:00:51.841 --> 00:00:52.110
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>

39
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.800
<v Speaker 1>And so I was like,</v>

40
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

41

47
00:01:00.181 --> 00:01:01.230
<v Speaker 1>and ask you for a picture.</v>

48
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.340

49
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.320
<v Speaker 1>somebody came up and was like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

00:03:43.061 --> 00:03:45.970
<v Speaker 2>You know what they did before the book was published?</v>

154
00:03:45.971 --> 00:03:48.220
<v Speaker 2>They sent me an entire copy of the book.</v>

155
00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.000
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>

156
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.481
<v Speaker 2>governor,</v>

157
00:03:49.481 --> 00:03:51.880
<v Speaker 2>please read this and if you have any problems,</v>

158
00:03:51.881 --> 00:03:52.714
<v Speaker 2>call us.</v>

159
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.040
<v Speaker 2>So I read the book.</v>

160
00:03:54.041 --> 00:03:56.920
<v Speaker 2>I didn't hide from the fact that I was in the Mongols.</v>

161
00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.023
<v Speaker 2>I never do,</v>

162
00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.260
<v Speaker 2>but I did want them to change something and they did.</v>

163
00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:03.310
<v Speaker 2>When I called them,</v>

164
00:04:03.311 --> 00:04:04.090
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

165
00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.070
<v Speaker 2>you stated the history of the Mongols that we started off like all white</v>

166
00:04:09.071 --> 00:04:12.010
<v Speaker 2>supremist outlaw motorcycle clubs.</v>

167
00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:13.030
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

168
00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.340
<v Speaker 2>I would never joined anything that was white supremacy.</v>

169
00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:17.590
<v Speaker 2>I said to me,</v>

170
00:04:17.591 --> 00:04:21.790
<v Speaker 2>a biker is a lifestyle and the color of your skin has nothing to do with it.</v>

171
00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:23.103
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

172
00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:25.810
<v Speaker 2>and the Mongols were not white supremacy.</v>

173
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:27.190
<v Speaker 2>And she said to me,</v>

174
00:04:27.191 --> 00:04:27.371
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

175
00:04:27.371 --> 00:04:28.120
<v Speaker 2>governor,</v>

176
00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.530
<v Speaker 2>how can you prove that?</v>

177
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:31.210
<v Speaker 2>I started laughing.</v>

178
00:04:31.211 --> 00:04:31.571
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

179
00:04:31.571 --> 00:04:33.190
<v Speaker 2>I think I can prove it easily.</v>

180
00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.761
<v Speaker 2>She goes,</v>

181
00:04:33.761 --> 00:04:34.511
<v Speaker 2>tell me this.</v>

182
00:04:34.511 --> 00:04:36.160
<v Speaker 2>They editor at random house.</v>

183
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:37.450
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

184
00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.810
<v Speaker 2>at what time did Mexicans become white supremacists?</v>

185
00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.810
<v Speaker 2>Because I said the Mongols are 75 percent Latino,</v>

186
00:04:43.811 --> 00:04:44.644
<v Speaker 2>Mexican.</v>

187
00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.390
<v Speaker 2>I was one of the few white guys who could ride into east la and never be</v>

188
00:04:49.391 --> 00:04:51.040
<v Speaker 2>bothered because of my patch.</v>

189
00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:53.410
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

190
00:04:53.411 --> 00:04:56.950
<v Speaker 2>so how can you call us what the Mongols started because they weren't.</v>

191
00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.740
<v Speaker 2>Mexicans weren't allowed in the hell's angels.</v>

192
00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:01.061
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

193
00:05:01.061 --> 00:05:01.920
<v Speaker 2>I sold it.</v>

194
00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:06.760
<v Speaker 2>So the Mongols were the Mexican bikers started their own bike club because they</v>

195
00:05:06.761 --> 00:05:08.410
<v Speaker 2>weren't allowed to be angels</v>

196
00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.830
<v Speaker 3>and these pigeons are eating from the top of it and they're so stupid that they</v>

197
00:05:13.831 --> 00:05:16.160
<v Speaker 3>just get sucked into the grave,</v>

198
00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.630
<v Speaker 3>Jesus and chopped up into that bread.</v>

199
00:05:18.631 --> 00:05:21.030
<v Speaker 3>So like if you've had bread in Russia lately,</v>

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.600
<v Speaker 3>a lot of his page and page share this video to down.</v>

201
00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:27.270

202
00:05:27.271 --> 00:05:28.130
<v Speaker 3>Three down to</v>

203
00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.540
<v Speaker 3>one of them falls and lands in and just get sucked in at.</v>

204
00:05:33.541 --> 00:05:34.374
<v Speaker 3>This is this,</v>

205
00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.710
<v Speaker 3>this is fucking insane.</v>

206
00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.240
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the most disturbing.</v>

207
00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.270
<v Speaker 3>Jamie immediately make a video of this.</v>

208

209
00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:46.860
<v Speaker 3>The world needs to know more.</v>

210
00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.351
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

211
00:05:48.351 --> 00:05:49.320
<v Speaker 3>it's a fuck.</v>

212
00:05:49.321 --> 00:05:50.154
<v Speaker 3>That's harsh.</v>

213
00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.950
<v Speaker 3>It's very gross and scary and sad.</v>

214
00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.500
<v Speaker 3>How it's just a harsh life.</v>

215
00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.620
<v Speaker 3>A dumber to.</v>

216
00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.461
<v Speaker 2>Well look,</v>

217
00:05:58.461 --> 00:06:00.410
<v Speaker 2>I'll where their heads are mad if your head was that little.</v>

218
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:01.731
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

219
00:06:01.731 --> 00:06:02.360
<v Speaker 2>I guess,</v>

220
00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.193
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

221
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:07.510
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

222
00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:10.820
<v Speaker 3>so I mean Zika babies grow up to be pretty smart.</v>

223
00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:11.390
<v Speaker 3>Nope,</v>

224
00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:12.260
<v Speaker 3>we haven't had any.</v>

225
00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:13.280
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>

226
00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.320
<v Speaker 3>Actually it hasn't grown up are really.</v>

227
00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:16.213
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>

228
00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:16.940
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

229
00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:18.020
<v Speaker 3>not that I've ever heard of.</v>

230
00:06:18.021 --> 00:06:18.800
<v Speaker 3>I just made that up.</v>

231
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.810
<v Speaker 3>I think there's actually adult Zika babies.</v>

232
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.610
<v Speaker 3>I think so because I was thinking about making Zika hats for Zika people,</v>

233
00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:26.300
<v Speaker 3>so it makes it look like their heads are bigger.</v>

234
00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:31.870
<v Speaker 2>My Dad grew up in the jungle.</v>

235
00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:33.700
<v Speaker 2>What jungle in India.</v>

236
00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:34.803
<v Speaker 2>Oh Jesus.</v>

237
00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:39.870
<v Speaker 2>So literally when he hunted tigers leopards a wild boar.</v>

238
00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:42.640
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

239
00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:44.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

241
00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:46.000
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

242
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.170
<v Speaker 2>It was born in 1925,</v>

243
00:06:47.171 --> 00:06:48.360
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>

244
00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:49.203
<v Speaker 2>back then it was,</v>

245
00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:51.610
<v Speaker 2>it's not like he would hunt them for fun,</v>

246
00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:53.471
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

247
00:06:53.471 --> 00:06:54.430

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:55.593
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

249

250
00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:59.150
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

251
00:06:59.151 --> 00:06:59.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:02.710
<v Speaker 2>This last one that he shot was in the sixties when it was already.</v>

253
00:07:02.711 --> 00:07:03.780
<v Speaker 2>It was already banned.</v>

254
00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:04.890
<v Speaker 2>You weren't allowed to shoot tigers in.</v>

255
00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:06.190
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>

256

258
00:07:11.591 --> 00:07:13.240
<v Speaker 2>So they had asked my dad to,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Like that was a lot like it.</v>

269
00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:27.550
<v Speaker 2>It was equivalent to that.</v>

270
00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:29.260
<v Speaker 2>Somebody's saying to you today,</v>

271
00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:30.640
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you $15.</v>

272
00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:31.630

00:07:32.741 --> 00:07:32.861
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

278
00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:37.900
<v Speaker 2>So they made like an exemption and they were like,</v>

279
00:07:37.901 --> 00:07:38.360
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

280
00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.380
<v Speaker 2>because he's getting a manometer.</v>

281
00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:40.770
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't like he was just randomly coming.</v>

282
00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:42.130
<v Speaker 2>Tiger boy,</v>

283
00:07:42.131 --> 00:07:42.964
<v Speaker 2>that's a monster</v>

284
00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:44.680
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

285
00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:45.820
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you exactly how he did it.</v>

286
00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:46.691
<v Speaker 2>I remember the story.</v>

287
00:07:46.691 --> 00:07:47.524
<v Speaker 2>Clearly he would.</v>

288
00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:48.070
<v Speaker 2>He got,</v>

289
00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:50.680
<v Speaker 2>he went to where there was two trees side by side.</v>

290
00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:55.540
<v Speaker 2>So he built up a little fort in this one tree and then he tied a bull,</v>

291
00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:58.060
<v Speaker 2>a blu walks around the other tree,</v>

292
00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:02.560
<v Speaker 2>and then he went and sat up in the tree at around five,</v>

293
00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:07.630
<v Speaker 2>6:00 in the evening and he sat there and I'm reading magazines and stuff.</v>

294
00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:08.690
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

295
00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:12.280
<v Speaker 2>and then he knew when the night falls that the tiger would come out.</v>

296
00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:15.940
<v Speaker 2>And then as soon as the bullets started going crazy and running around the tree</v>

297
00:08:15.941 --> 00:08:17.320
<v Speaker 2>a lot because he knew he was scared.</v>

298
00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:18.560
<v Speaker 2>My Dad was,</v>

299
00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:19.780
<v Speaker 2>he had the shotgun with them,</v>

300
00:08:19.781 --> 00:08:20.650
<v Speaker 2>a three or a three.</v>

301
00:08:20.651 --> 00:08:20.951
<v Speaker 2>Oh wait,</v>

302
00:08:20.951 --> 00:08:21.784
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

303
00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:22.863
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

304
00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:27.640
<v Speaker 2>and he had his flashlight and the minute his flashlight touched the barrel of</v>

305
00:08:27.641 --> 00:08:28.960
<v Speaker 2>the gun,</v>

306
00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:30.910
<v Speaker 2>it made a metal noise.</v>

307
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.170
<v Speaker 2>And then as soon as he did that,</v>

308
00:08:32.171 --> 00:08:35.770
<v Speaker 2>the tiger looked up at him and instead of going for the ox,</v>

309
00:08:35.771 --> 00:08:37.810
<v Speaker 2>leaped straight at my dad and the tree.</v>

310
00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:38.651
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

311
00:08:38.651 --> 00:08:42.100
<v Speaker 2>My Dad just fumbled and shot and hit him right here in the throat.</v>

312
00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:43.670
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

313
00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:44.530
<v Speaker 2>Flipped back.</v>

314
00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:45.963
<v Speaker 2>And then he,</v>

315
00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:49.930
<v Speaker 2>he flashed the flashlight on his eyes to see if they were so glossy and then he</v>

316
00:08:49.931 --> 00:08:51.550
<v Speaker 2>put another shot and just for safety.</v>

317
00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:57.310
<v Speaker 2>And we have that skin to the holy shit.</v>

318
00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:58.690
<v Speaker 2>You're done with gangster.</v>
