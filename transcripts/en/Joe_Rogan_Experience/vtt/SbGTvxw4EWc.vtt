<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:08.010
<v Speaker 1>what's an honor?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a tall,</v>

163
00:09:08.011 --> 00:09:12.030
<v Speaker 1>slender.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hairless is an auditor as opposed to a</v>

164

<v Speaker 1>big hairy fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a bear.</v>

165
00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:19.730
<v Speaker 1>And a younger bear is actually a cub</v>
<v Speaker 1>bears go with cubs and cubs are just</v>

166
00:09:21.181 --> 00:09:26.181
<v Speaker 1>smaller and more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I heard that the word Twinkies</v>

171
00:09:45.121 --> 00:09:46.950
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh look at all these twinks here.</v>

172
00:09:46.951 --> 00:09:49.580
<v Speaker 1>And then the twin community got really</v>
<v Speaker 1>upset and started doing it.</v>

173
00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:52.740
<v Speaker 1>And so he apologized.</v>

174
00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:00.960
<v Speaker 1>He apologized to the twinks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody is looking for an opportunity</v>

175
00:10:00.961 --> 00:10:03.870
<v Speaker 1>to be sensitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are in such a weird time.</v>

176
00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:07.920
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like people have found reward in</v>
