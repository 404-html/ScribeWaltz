00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:02.970
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.161
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3
00:00:03.161 --> 00:00:07.700
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a beautiful thing about being influenced by movies and books and</v>

4
00:00:07.701 --> 00:00:11.450
<v Speaker 1>songs in that they provide us with entertainment and inspiration,</v>

5
00:00:11.451 --> 00:00:16.451
<v Speaker 1>but they also really distort the shit out of realistic scenarios.</v>

6
00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.090
<v Speaker 1>But I think you're supposed to be able to distinguish between that though.</v>

7
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.690
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

8
00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.300
<v Speaker 1>art is one thing in reality as another art.</v>

9
00:00:23.301 --> 00:00:23.511
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

10
00:00:23.511 --> 00:00:27.710
<v Speaker 1>I think it's based on reality and then we've got a couple wins is reality so</v>

11
00:00:27.711 --> 00:00:28.544
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>

12
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:28.931
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

13
00:00:28.931 --> 00:00:29.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

14
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:30.710
<v Speaker 1>Especially with women.</v>

15
00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.470
<v Speaker 1>How many women have these discs,</v>

16
00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.170
<v Speaker 1>but especially young women that have these distorted perceptions of Channing</v>

17
00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:37.003
<v Speaker 1>Tatum movies.</v>

18
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:38.370
<v Speaker 1>Channing Tatum is,</v>

19
00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.520
<v Speaker 1>that's how men behave and this is reality.</v>

20
00:00:40.521 --> 00:00:41.480
<v Speaker 1>It's going to happen to me.</v>

21
00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:42.950
<v Speaker 1>I just gotta find my prints.</v>

22
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:44.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

23
00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.030
<v Speaker 1>It's just not a bunch of you want to come in you,</v>

24
00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.340
<v Speaker 1>that's all it really is out there.</v>

25
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.780
<v Speaker 1>They're just lying.</v>

26
00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:51.710
<v Speaker 1>And both sides.</v>

27
00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:51.910
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

28
00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.880
<v Speaker 1>the aggressive male side and the men who pretending they're not like all the</v>

29
00:00:55.881 --> 00:00:56.930
<v Speaker 1>other men cause they want to come.</v>

30
00:00:56.931 --> 00:00:57.351
<v Speaker 1>And you too.</v>

31
00:00:57.351 --> 00:01:00.440
<v Speaker 1>And that's the only way they can go about getting in there as being unique.</v>

32
00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:00.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

33
00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:01.250
<v Speaker 1>Or,</v>

34
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.290
<v Speaker 1>or just being like on your side,</v>

35
00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:04.370
<v Speaker 1>men are shit,</v>

36
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:04.761
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

37
00:01:04.761 --> 00:01:05.031
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

38
00:01:05.031 --> 00:01:05.531
<v Speaker 1>I'm hot.</v>

39
00:01:05.531 --> 00:01:06.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm horrified to be a man.</v>

40
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.123
<v Speaker 1>Your Shit,</v>

41
00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:10.640
<v Speaker 1>you see that on,</v>

42
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.060
<v Speaker 1>on Twitter and it's most archaic form,</v>

43
00:01:14.061 --> 00:01:15.260
<v Speaker 1>which is the White Knight.</v>

44
00:01:15.261 --> 00:01:15.890
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

45
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.440
<v Speaker 2>I fucking love the White Knight.</v>

46
00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.110
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I really verbally go,</v>

47
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:22.430
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

48
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.000
<v Speaker 2>reading anything else but white knights on Twitter.</v>

49
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.430
<v Speaker 2>When you bash somebody who's a girl,</v>

50
00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.640
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

51
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.980
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

52
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:29.330
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

53
00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:30.141
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

54
00:01:30.141 --> 00:01:31.400
<v Speaker 2>you call her out on something.</v>

55
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:32.200
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

56
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.800
<v Speaker 2>and then some guys swoops in,</v>

57
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.120
<v Speaker 2>don't take that.</v>

58
00:01:35.121 --> 00:01:36.200
<v Speaker 2>You are beautiful.</v>

59
00:01:36.201 --> 00:01:37.940
<v Speaker 2>You're a beautiful person and this,</v>

60
00:01:37.941 --> 00:01:39.350
<v Speaker 2>and he just like,</v>

61
00:01:39.351 --> 00:01:40.184
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

62
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.731
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

63
00:01:40.731 --> 00:01:42.110
<v Speaker 2>you just want to fuck her.</v>

64
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.880
<v Speaker 2>You want to do the same thing.</v>

65
00:01:43.881 --> 00:01:46.370
<v Speaker 2>The guy that's fucking bashing or but wants to do.</v>

66
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.230
<v Speaker 2>He's just taking a different angle,</v>

67
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

68
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.070
<v Speaker 2>and you swoop in and what is their mindset?</v>

69
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.970
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

70
00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.080
<v Speaker 2>DM me,</v>

71
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.670
<v Speaker 2>you're a good man.</v>

72
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.933
<v Speaker 2>Does it stop it?</v>

73
00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:58.190
<v Speaker 2>They just want love,</v>

74
00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:59.403
<v Speaker 2>love.</v>

75
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.700
<v Speaker 2>Love is not going to get their way.</v>

76
00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:02.570
<v Speaker 2>They just want love.</v>

77
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.540
<v Speaker 2>It just doesn't have it.</v>

78
00:02:03.541 --> 00:02:06.320
<v Speaker 2>I've given up on the concept of love.</v>

79
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.290
<v Speaker 2>I honestly don't think it really exists.</v>

80
00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:11.170
<v Speaker 2>And this is something a lot of people have called me on.</v>

81
00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.710
<v Speaker 2>I think love is a cross between um,</v>

82
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.980
<v Speaker 2>lust and an obsession.</v>

83
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.000
<v Speaker 2>Kind of a,</v>

84
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.410
<v Speaker 2>not really obsession.</v>

85
00:02:21.411 --> 00:02:22.400
<v Speaker 2>I think maybe um,</v>

86
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.331
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

87
00:02:23.331 --> 00:02:28.331
<v Speaker 2>a fascination kind of just this quick thing that happens.</v>

88
00:02:28.521 --> 00:02:29.660
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't last long.</v>

89
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.340
<v Speaker 2>It could last maybe a couple,</v>

90
00:02:31.341 --> 00:02:32.174
<v Speaker 2>a few years,</v>

91
00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:33.643
<v Speaker 2>quite a few years,</v>

92
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.120
<v Speaker 2>but it's still the same thing.</v>

93
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.360
<v Speaker 2>It's lust and this fascination with the person and that conjures up this mixture</v>

94
00:02:42.831 --> 00:02:44.840
<v Speaker 2>that seems like something that's love.</v>

95
00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.220
<v Speaker 2>In the perfect scenario.</v>

96
00:02:46.221 --> 00:02:47.930
<v Speaker 2>You don't think that people can be in love?</v>

97
00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:49.483
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

98
00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.740
<v Speaker 2>I honestly don't see</v>

99
00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:54.500
<v Speaker 2>two people.</v>

100
00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.650
<v Speaker 2>I think honest love would be like,</v>

101
00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.160
<v Speaker 2>you just never argue.</v>

102
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.780
<v Speaker 2>You agree with everything.</v>

103
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.330
<v Speaker 2>There's never a snooty snippy moment,</v>

104
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.070
<v Speaker 2>so it just doesn't exist.</v>

105
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.680
<v Speaker 2>And in time it,</v>

106
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:08.980
<v Speaker 2>it transmit,</v>

107
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.020
<v Speaker 2>it transfers into something more,</v>

108
00:03:11.021 --> 00:03:11.854
<v Speaker 2>a habit,</v>

109
00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.450
<v Speaker 2>a habitual thing.</v>

110
00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.740
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

111
00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:18.740
<v Speaker 2>the lust turns into habit and the fascination turns into comfort zone.</v>

112
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.670
<v Speaker 2>And then you're just together and you continue to be together and you don't even</v>

113
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:25.960
<v Speaker 2>know about love anymore.</v>

114
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.730
<v Speaker 2>You're not coming home every day.</v>

115
00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:28.960
<v Speaker 2>You're not at the office going,</v>

116
00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.681
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

117
00:03:29.681 --> 00:03:30.910
<v Speaker 2>I want to be with her.</v>

118
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.660
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

119
00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:32.590
<v Speaker 2>when you first get together,</v>

120
00:03:32.591 --> 00:03:33.130
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

121
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:34.150
<v Speaker 2>I can't even work.</v>

122
00:03:34.151 --> 00:03:35.170
<v Speaker 2>I love this girl.</v>

123
00:03:35.171 --> 00:03:36.190
<v Speaker 2>I want to be with her.</v>

124
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.950

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.250

<v Speaker 1>But what is that?</v>

144
00:04:19.081 --> 00:04:19.740

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.950
<v Speaker 1>The newness is a hormonal rush to make babies and you're supposed to fuck the</v>

150
00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:29.520
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

151
00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.870
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

152
00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:30.001
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

153
00:04:30.001 --> 00:04:31.560
<v Speaker 1>That's why relationships,</v>

154
00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:33.180
<v Speaker 1>most relationships.</v>

155
00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.340
<v Speaker 1>Peter out around three months in,</v>

156
00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.500
<v Speaker 1>that's when the woman hits her first trimester.</v>

157
00:04:37.501 --> 00:04:39.810
<v Speaker 1>She's already supposed to be pregnant and you're supposed to be out of there.</v>

158
00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.391
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

159
00:04:40.391 --> 00:04:41.190
<v Speaker 1>Bang in a new one.</v>

160
00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.790
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

161
00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.800
<v Speaker 1>Because people were getting eaten by Jaguars on a daily basis.</v>

162
00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.510
<v Speaker 1>You had to fuck as many people as you possibly could in order to ensure that</v>

163
00:04:48.511 --> 00:04:49.890
<v Speaker 1>this the species survived.</v>

164
00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:50.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

165
00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.730
<v Speaker 1>The problem is our high mortality rate when they then when human beings were in</v>

166
00:04:53.731 --> 00:04:58.731
<v Speaker 1>their infancy are high mortality rate led to very specific types of behaviors</v>

167
00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:04.020
<v Speaker 1>that are ingrained in our genetics and those specific types of behaviors are</v>

168
00:05:04.021 --> 00:05:05.940
<v Speaker 1>frowned upon by feminists now.</v>

169
00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.980
<v Speaker 1>They the the the very thing that got us to 2014 they trying to curve back.</v>

170
00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:11.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

171
00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:14.460
<v Speaker 1>This is like deceptive behavior in order to try to get laid,</v>

172
00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:15.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

173
00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.870
<v Speaker 1>any type of sex other than the sex that they feel comfortable with.</v>

174
00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy that this happened.</v>

175
00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:21.100
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>

176
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.291
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

177
00:05:21.291 --> 00:05:23.970
<v Speaker 1>if the man's have you had fucked her I left leg.</v>

178
00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.883
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

179
00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:25.230
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

180
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.860
<v Speaker 1>it's anything that's not along the lines of their,</v>

181
00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:29.311
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

182
00:05:29.311 --> 00:05:30.810
<v Speaker 1>their ideal is,</v>

183
00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:31.830
<v Speaker 1>is a rape.</v>

184
00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:32.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

185
00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

186
00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:33.131
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

187
00:05:33.131 --> 00:05:33.901
<v Speaker 1>and like you said,</v>

188
00:05:33.901 --> 00:05:38.901
<v Speaker 1>it's just biological for the preservation of humanity early on.</v>

189
00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.610
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] that's how we needed to add.</v>

190
00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.050
<v Speaker 1>Here's where it gets more fascinating.</v>

191
00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.680
<v Speaker 1>The women who are trying to tighten this down as much as possible.</v>

192
00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.200
<v Speaker 1>No one wants a fuck.</v>

193
00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:50.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

194
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.251
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

195
00:05:50.251 --> 00:05:53.310
<v Speaker 1>At the very top of the fucking machine,</v>

196
00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:57.470
<v Speaker 1>the very top of the machine is run by troll ladies.</v>

197
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.501
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

198
00:06:00.501 --> 00:06:01.231
<v Speaker 2>All ladies did.</v>

199
00:06:01.231 --> 00:06:02.064
<v Speaker 2>Y'all ladies,</v>

200
00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:04.280
<v Speaker 2>they're not like really sexy,</v>

201
00:06:04.281 --> 00:06:06.860
<v Speaker 2>attractive objects of desire.</v>

202
00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:07.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

203
00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:08.083
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

204
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:08.711
<v Speaker 2>I think when,</v>

205
00:06:08.711 --> 00:06:13.460
<v Speaker 2>when they speak about like how like how can a man dictate what happens to our</v>

206
00:06:13.461 --> 00:06:14.840
<v Speaker 2>bodies kind of a thing.</v>

207
00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:18.530
<v Speaker 2>It's the same thing as how can you dictate what happens to a pretty girl?</v>

208
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:19.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

209
00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:23.330
<v Speaker 2>Like you're not a pretty girl so you don't understand what it's like to be that</v>

210
00:06:23.331 --> 00:06:27.680
<v Speaker 2>and to be able to manipulate men in such a fashion so you,</v>

211
00:06:27.681 --> 00:06:28.461
<v Speaker 2>she should probably,</v>

212
00:06:28.461 --> 00:06:33.230
<v Speaker 2>the troll ladies should probably steer clear of what they think attractive men</v>

213
00:06:33.231 --> 00:06:34.064
<v Speaker 2>and women should do.</v>

214
00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.860
<v Speaker 2>It's really funny though to watch.</v>

215
00:06:36.861 --> 00:06:39.230
<v Speaker 2>And I'm a lonely cat guy in my house,</v>

216
00:06:39.231 --> 00:06:39.471
<v Speaker 2>Joe.</v>

217
00:06:39.471 --> 00:06:40.304
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

218
00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:42.050
<v Speaker 2>That's what it's come to.</v>

219
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:43.130
<v Speaker 2>A lonely cat guy.</v>

220
00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:44.570
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

221
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:47.120
<v Speaker 2>I occasionally have some bitches over though.</v>

222
00:06:47.121 --> 00:06:47.954
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

223
00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:49.910
<v Speaker 2>you gotta I tell,</v>

224
00:06:49.911 --> 00:06:50.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

225
00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:51.161
<v Speaker 2>like I said with,</v>

226
00:06:51.161 --> 00:06:51.801
<v Speaker 2>with this whole,</v>

227
00:06:51.801 --> 00:06:51.981
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

228
00:06:51.981 --> 00:06:53.330
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe in love thing.</v>

229
00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:57.950
<v Speaker 2>I've had to convey to two girls that do come over the house,</v>

230
00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:58.610
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

231
00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:00.350
<v Speaker 2>that I am not a boyfriend.</v>

232
00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm not your boyfriend or anything and it's so hard.</v>

233
00:07:03.291 --> 00:07:04.124
<v Speaker 2>It's a hard thing.</v>

234
00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:05.053
<v Speaker 2>You tell them.</v>

235
00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:06.740
<v Speaker 2>So you are not your boyfriend.</v>

236
00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:08.270
<v Speaker 2>I went through so many years,</v>

237
00:07:08.271 --> 00:07:09.020
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

238
00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:11.090
<v Speaker 2>of being with girls much too long,</v>

239
00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.650
<v Speaker 2>much longer than I should have.</v>

240
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:13.783
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

241
00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:15.080
<v Speaker 2>a couple of weeks.</v>

242
00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:16.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

243
00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:16.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

244
00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:16.971
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

245
00:07:16.971 --> 00:07:19.550
<v Speaker 2>I was one of those fucking years guys.</v>

246
00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:23.510
<v Speaker 2>Like I've stayed in the marriage that I hated for nine fucking years,</v>

247
00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:24.710
<v Speaker 2>nine years.</v>

248
00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.490
<v Speaker 2>And I think radio was part of it because I had gotten into radio halfway through</v>

249
00:07:28.491 --> 00:07:29.180
<v Speaker 2>the marriage.</v>

250
00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:30.140
<v Speaker 2>So the second half,</v>

251
00:07:30.141 --> 00:07:31.670
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even pay attention to it.</v>

252
00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:33.370
<v Speaker 2>It was all about fucking radio.</v>

253
00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:34.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean radio the straight,</v>

254
00:07:34.551 --> 00:07:34.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

255
00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:37.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to build this in a concentrate on that.</v>

256
00:07:37.101 --> 00:07:41.750
<v Speaker 2>So whatever burden she was was outweighed by the pleasure of doing radio.</v>

257
00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:42.860
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

258
00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:43.730
<v Speaker 2>but after nine years,</v>

259
00:07:43.731 --> 00:07:44.091
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>

260
00:07:44.091 --> 00:07:44.810
<v Speaker 2>that was it.</v>

261
00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:45.350
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

262
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:49.700
<v Speaker 2>but I jumped right from that into another relationship that just lasted years.</v>

263
00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:50.960
<v Speaker 2>And then after that,</v>

264
00:07:50.961 --> 00:07:55.961
<v Speaker 2>when I started thinking like maybe I shouldn't be tell these girls like that,</v>

265
00:07:56.031 --> 00:07:57.890
<v Speaker 2>I feel for them so much,</v>

266
00:07:58.430 --> 00:07:59.263
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

267
00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:00.800
<v Speaker 2>and now I just say,</v>

268
00:08:00.801 --> 00:08:01.634
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

269
00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:03.140
<v Speaker 2>understand what this is.</v>

270
00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.360
<v Speaker 2>We are not boyfriend and girlfriend.</v>

271
00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:08.920
<v Speaker 2>I am not in a relationship with you and,</v>

272
00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:09.560
<v Speaker 2>and it,</v>

273
00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:10.393
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

274
00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:11.930
<v Speaker 2>it almost works.</v>

275
00:08:11.931 --> 00:08:12.740
<v Speaker 2>I have done,</v>

276
00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:13.970
<v Speaker 2>I have to fine tune it.</v>

277
00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:16.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm almost there though.</v>

278
00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:20.190
<v Speaker 2>So they don't get the message and it's um,</v>

279
00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:21.200
<v Speaker 2>I start getting thing.</v>

280
00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:22.580
<v Speaker 2>But then when I stuck getting texts,</v>

281
00:08:22.581 --> 00:08:23.270
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like,</v>

282
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:24.860
<v Speaker 2>these are girlfriend texts.</v>

283
00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:26.990
<v Speaker 2>We're not in a relationship.</v>

284
00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:28.100
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

285
00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:28.311
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

286
00:08:28.311 --> 00:08:29.660
<v Speaker 2>this is a girlfriend text.</v>

287
00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:31.340
<v Speaker 2>Like what's an example of a girlfriend?</v>

288
00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:32.600
<v Speaker 2>A girlfriend tax.</v>

289
00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:33.590
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

290
00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:35.540
<v Speaker 2>you said I could do this.</v>

291
00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:39.410
<v Speaker 2>And then at the last minute you told me that I can't do it with you.</v>

292
00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:41.840
<v Speaker 2>I can't go here or do this or something.</v>

293
00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:42.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

294
00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:46.250
<v Speaker 2>I changed my mind or I have something else where I made other plans.</v>

295
00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:47.001
<v Speaker 2>It happens.</v>

357
00:10:09.541 --> 00:10:10.320
<v Speaker 2>Why would I tell you?</v>

358
00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.190
<v Speaker 2>Why wouldn't you?</v>

359
00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:12.090
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

361
00:10:12.331 --> 00:10:13.170
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to hear this.</v>

362
00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:14.430
<v Speaker 2>I just don't want to hear it.</v>

363
00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:15.181
<v Speaker 2>But that's,</v>

364
00:10:15.181 --> 00:10:15.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

365
00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:17.790
<v Speaker 2>there's certain patterns of relations in relationships to,</v>

366
00:10:17.791 --> 00:10:20.430
<v Speaker 2>people automatically fall into and they think they're allowed to.</v>

367
00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:21.540
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

368
00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:22.021
<v Speaker 2>These are,</v>

369
00:10:22.021 --> 00:10:26.460
<v Speaker 2>these are allowed because it's become commonplace and that's what they've been</v>

370
00:10:26.461 --> 00:10:27.690
<v Speaker 2>used to their whole life.</v>

371
00:10:27.691 --> 00:10:29.010
<v Speaker 2>And that's what this,</v>

372
00:10:29.011 --> 00:10:34.011
<v Speaker 2>this a groove that the guys have fallen into over the years where they know</v>

373
00:10:34.561 --> 00:10:34.830
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

374
00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:35.550
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

375
00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:37.110
<v Speaker 2>you just realize at one point you go,</v>

376
00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:38.213
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

377
00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:39.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm in a relationship.</v>

378
00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:44.520
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even want to be in one when we were dating or something or just hanging</v>

379
00:10:44.521 --> 00:10:45.354
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>

380
00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:48.120
<v Speaker 2>like why does it always have to turn into a relationship?</v>

381
00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:50.490
<v Speaker 2>And I've said to girls before,</v>

382
00:10:50.491 --> 00:10:51.000
<v Speaker 2>I've said,</v>

383
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.260
<v Speaker 2>relationships are the,</v>

384
00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:52.840
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

385
00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:53.170
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

386
00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:57.210
<v Speaker 2>the death knell for a good companionship.</v>

387
00:10:57.660 --> 00:10:59.880
<v Speaker 2>All of a sudden now there's obligations,</v>

388
00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:01.530
<v Speaker 2>responsibilities,</v>

389
00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:03.060
<v Speaker 2>accountabilities,</v>

390
00:11:03.061 --> 00:11:06.210
<v Speaker 2>all these things that come along with a relationship,</v>

391
00:11:06.211 --> 00:11:08.160
<v Speaker 2>take away from the good parts of hanging out,</v>

392
00:11:08.161 --> 00:11:09.630
<v Speaker 2>which is we're watching TV,</v>

393
00:11:09.631 --> 00:11:10.171
<v Speaker 2>we're drinking,</v>

394
00:11:10.171 --> 00:11:11.004
<v Speaker 2>we're fucking,</v>

395
00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:12.120
<v Speaker 2>we're going out to dinner.</v>

396
00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:15.420
<v Speaker 2>We're not arguing about anything because does that my phone?</v>

397
00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:15.661
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

398
00:11:15.661 --> 00:11:16.494
<v Speaker 2>I hope not.</v>

399
00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:18.420
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

400
00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:20.430
<v Speaker 2>How did you manage to avoid,</v>

401
00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:22.090
<v Speaker 2>it's your girlfriend.</v>

402
00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:26.710
<v Speaker 2>Like you avoided a,</v>

403
00:11:26.711 --> 00:11:27.840
<v Speaker 2>you avoided children.</v>

404
00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:28.621
<v Speaker 2>You got no children.</v>

405
00:11:28.621 --> 00:11:29.454
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

406
00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:30.683
<v Speaker 2>That's a big one.</v>

407
00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:35.870
<v Speaker 2>That is the biggest because I almost had a kid with my wife,</v>

408
00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:37.950
<v Speaker 2>which would have just been,</v>

409
00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:39.480
<v Speaker 2>I'd have had to kill myself.</v>

410
00:11:39.481 --> 00:11:41.880
<v Speaker 2>I think I would still have to do something to get out of it.</v>

411
00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:42.810
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

412
00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:43.100
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>

413
00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:43.410
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>

414
00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:43.980
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

415
00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:44.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

416
00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:44.941
<v Speaker 2>She went,</v>

417
00:11:44.941 --> 00:11:45.751
<v Speaker 2>she got first,</v>

418
00:11:45.751 --> 00:11:47.760
<v Speaker 2>she got one of those ectopic pregnancies,</v>

419
00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:52.170
<v Speaker 2>which happens in the Fallopian tube and blows up and she like started bleeding</v>

420
00:11:52.171 --> 00:11:54.070
<v Speaker 2>internally and a boy,</v>

421
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:57.910
<v Speaker 2>if I had a future me came back at the moment I was driving into the hospital,</v>

422
00:11:58.030 --> 00:11:59.650
<v Speaker 2>I may have made a stop at Mcdonald's</v>

423
00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:02.230
<v Speaker 2>or you know,</v>

424
00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:04.810
<v Speaker 2>I might've had to pick a few things up while she was in the passenger seat</v>

425
00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:05.673
<v Speaker 2>bleeding to death.</v>

426
00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:08.690
<v Speaker 2>Oh my goodness.</v>

427
00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:09.340
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

428
00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:10.570
<v Speaker 2>well you say this because she,</v>

429
00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:11.733
<v Speaker 2>she basically,</v>

430
00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:12.431
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

431
00:12:12.431 --> 00:12:14.440
<v Speaker 2>how much money you should take over the years.</v>

432
00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:15.610
<v Speaker 2>It was a bad divorce.</v>

433
00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:19.620
<v Speaker 2>It's seven figures she took and her long period of time too,</v>

434
00:12:19.621 --> 00:12:19.871
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

435
00:12:19.871 --> 00:12:20.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

436
00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.060
<v Speaker 2>She got Dominic Barbara for her lawyer,</v>

437
00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:22.961
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

438
00:12:22.961 --> 00:12:24.790

439
00:12:24.791 --> 00:12:29.791
<v Speaker 2>But Dominic Barbara was her lawyer and he was just so much fucking anger that I</v>

440
00:12:31.451 --> 00:12:31.900
<v Speaker 2>had.</v>

441
00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:33.400
<v Speaker 2>You think I'm angry now people.</v>

442
00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:34.263
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

443
00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:34.960
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

444
00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:35.793
<v Speaker 2>was I angry?</v>

445
00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:36.993
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

446
00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:37.991
<v Speaker 2>and yeah,</v>

447
00:12:37.991 --> 00:12:38.321
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

448
00:12:38.321 --> 00:12:40.180
<v Speaker 2>I hated them.</v>

449
00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:41.650
<v Speaker 2>I hated that whole camp.</v>

450
00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:42.910
<v Speaker 2>The lawyers,</v>

451
00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:44.680
<v Speaker 2>they'd come in and I,</v>

452
00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:46.360
<v Speaker 2>I had to pay her legal bills,</v>

453
00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:49.240
<v Speaker 2>which is another one of those great fucking amazing feminist things.</v>

454
00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:51.970
<v Speaker 2>I had to pay your legal bills and mine.</v>

455
00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:56.680
<v Speaker 2>So she hires Dominic Barbara and he's just this fucking way expensive attorney.</v>

456
00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:57.461
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>

457
00:12:57.461 --> 00:12:57.641
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

458
00:12:57.641 --> 00:12:58.630
<v Speaker 2>I got to save some money,</v>

459
00:12:58.631 --> 00:13:00.310
<v Speaker 2>so let me hire a cheaper attorney.</v>

460
00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:01.061
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

461
00:13:01.061 --> 00:13:01.871
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't work,</v>

462
00:13:01.871 --> 00:13:02.704
<v Speaker 2>Joe.</v>

463
00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:04.310
<v Speaker 2>That's ridiculous.</v>

464
00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:09.500
<v Speaker 2>The guy that would come in with like a Manila folder into court and they were,</v>

465
00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:12.370
<v Speaker 2>they had hand trucks of,</v>

466
00:13:12.371 --> 00:13:14.050
<v Speaker 2>of those big boxes,</v>

467
00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:14.781
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

468
00:13:14.781 --> 00:13:17.550
<v Speaker 2>of legal briefs and stuff on their side.</v>

469
00:13:17.551 --> 00:13:18.384
<v Speaker 2>And I'm just,</v>

470
00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:19.420
<v Speaker 2>it's just like,</v>

471
00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:19.571
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

472
00:13:19.571 --> 00:13:21.370
<v Speaker 2>this is the worst thing ever.</v>

473
00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:22.480
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

474
00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:22.651
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

475
00:13:22.651 --> 00:13:22.870
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

476
00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:26.530
<v Speaker 2>over the course of quite a few years I had to keep paying her and paying her and</v>

477
00:13:26.531 --> 00:13:28.720
<v Speaker 2>then it was over and I'm very happy with that.</v>

478
00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:30.040
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever communicate with her now?</v>

479
00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:30.880
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

480
00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:31.480
<v Speaker 2>Thank God.</v>

481
00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:32.201
<v Speaker 2>And I don't have to.</v>

482
00:13:32.201 --> 00:13:33.610
<v Speaker 2>And if I had kids I would have to,</v>

483
00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:35.890
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand how that happens.</v>

484
00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:37.660
<v Speaker 2>I like a lot of people say,</v>

485
00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:37.991
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

486
00:13:37.991 --> 00:13:38.261
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

487
00:13:38.261 --> 00:13:39.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

488
00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:40.810
<v Speaker 2>over the years we've built up a nice relationship.</v>

489
00:13:40.811 --> 00:13:40.951
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

490
00:13:40.951 --> 00:13:42.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm friends with my ex wife was like,</v>

491
00:13:42.191 --> 00:13:42.281
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

492
00:13:42.281 --> 00:13:42.910
<v Speaker 2>you're not.</v>

493
00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:47.910
<v Speaker 2>You had to develop something or you would have killed her or yourself or</v>

494
00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:49.293
<v Speaker 2>everyone involved.</v>

495
00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:50.230
<v Speaker 2>You have a kid,</v>

496
00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:54.130
<v Speaker 2>so you have to kind of build some type of relationship with her.</v>

497
00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:58.540
<v Speaker 2>I have a buddy who's friends with his ex girlfriend and his ex girlfriend is now</v>

498
00:13:58.541 --> 00:14:01.930
<v Speaker 2>married to another one of his friends and they have kids together and they get</v>

499
00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:03.280
<v Speaker 2>all their kids together and play.</v>

500
00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:04.233
<v Speaker 2>That's weird.</v>

501
00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:05.620
<v Speaker 2>That's just odd.</v>

502
00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:07.990
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it ever goes away.</v>

503
00:14:07.991 --> 00:14:09.820
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that you fucked her.</v>

504
00:14:09.821 --> 00:14:10.690
<v Speaker 2>Ever goes away.</v>

505
00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:11.560
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

506
00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:12.393
<v Speaker 2>probably not.</v>

507
00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:13.341
<v Speaker 2>Probably not.</v>

508
00:14:13.341 --> 00:14:14.130
<v Speaker 2>The uh,</v>

509
00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:16.780
<v Speaker 2>the ex boyfriend and the new husband,</v>

510
00:14:16.781 --> 00:14:20.530
<v Speaker 2>they do have a little weird thing with each other with the new husband will</v>

511
00:14:20.531 --> 00:14:25.060
<v Speaker 2>occasionally criticized the ex boyfriend and a little bit of an over excessive</v>

512
00:14:25.061 --> 00:14:25.630
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

513
00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:26.290
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

514
00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:30.450
<v Speaker 2>Cause he knows that I'm going to keep this thing going on in the Dick</v>

516
00:14:34.181 --> 00:14:38.890
<v Speaker 2>But we know there's a lot of weirdness to it all weirdness.</v>

517

00:14:43.991 --> 00:14:44.411
<v Speaker 2>Dominic,</v>

524
00:14:44.411 --> 00:14:44.800
<v Speaker 2>Barbara,</v>

525
00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:45.990
<v Speaker 2>the lawyer for my wife,</v>

526
00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:47.050
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

527
00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:48.700
<v Speaker 2>he came to my house</v>

528
00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:51.083
<v Speaker 2>a couple of months ago.</v>

529
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:52.670
<v Speaker 2>For what knocked on the door,</v>

530
00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:57.700
<v Speaker 2>came to the house because he heard that I got fired from Sirius Xm and he was</v>

531
00:14:58.281 --> 00:14:58.640
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

532
00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:00.380
<v Speaker 2>I just got out of rehab,</v>

533
00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:02.750
<v Speaker 2>drugs and alcohol ruined my life.</v>

534
00:15:02.751 --> 00:15:04.430
<v Speaker 2>I don't longer have a law practice.</v>

535
00:15:04.431 --> 00:15:05.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

536
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:05.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

537
00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:05.690
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

538
00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:10.100
<v Speaker 2>he got arrested for stealing from one of the stores of the Miracle Mile there</v>

539
00:15:10.101 --> 00:15:11.870
<v Speaker 2>and a lot on long island.</v>

540
00:15:11.871 --> 00:15:12.530
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

541
00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:13.363
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

542
00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:14.660
<v Speaker 2>and he's just,</v>

543
00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:15.920
<v Speaker 2>he's destitute now.</v>

544
00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:17.240
<v Speaker 2>He was living on his friend's couch.</v>

545
00:15:17.241 --> 00:15:21.650
<v Speaker 2>He went from that attorney that was always on Howard's show and made millions of</v>

546
00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:21.651
<v Speaker 2>dollars,</v>

547
00:15:21.651 --> 00:15:23.450
<v Speaker 2>obviously made some off of me.</v>

548
00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:24.200
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

549
00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:25.730
<v Speaker 2>and then he's just destitute now.</v>

550
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.710
<v Speaker 2>So I read the stories in the paper before I got fired and everything and ended.</v>

551
00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:30.560
<v Speaker 2>I'll always laughed.</v>

552
00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:30.921
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>

553

<v Speaker 2>good,</v>

554

<v Speaker 2>good for him,</v>

555
00:15:32.061 --> 00:15:33.200
<v Speaker 2>Karma motherfucker.</v>

556
00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:34.393
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

557
00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:35.031

561
00:15:37.461 --> 00:15:38.290
<v Speaker 2>Karmically,</v>

562

<v Speaker 2>I think it is too.</v>

564
00:15:39.501 --> 00:15:40.060
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

565
00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:40.370
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>

566
00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:41.170
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

567
00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:42.003
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

568
00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:43.371
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

569
00:15:43.371 --> 00:15:43.890
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

570
00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:44.270
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

571
00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:44.660
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

572
00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:46.600
<v Speaker 2>he knocked on my door and I'm looking out the window.</v>

573
00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:46.821
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>

574
00:15:46.821 --> 00:15:48.050
<v Speaker 2>I think that's fucking Dominic Barbara.</v>

575
00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:50.810
<v Speaker 2>And he comes in and he was trying to preach to me,</v>

576
00:15:50.811 --> 00:15:51.830
<v Speaker 2>like he's saying,</v>

577
00:15:51.831 --> 00:15:52.410
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

578
00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:52.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

579
00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:54.980
<v Speaker 2>I read what happened and I'm thinking maybe you know,</v>

580
00:15:54.981 --> 00:15:56.540
<v Speaker 2>you need help or something,</v>

581
00:15:56.541 --> 00:15:58.100
<v Speaker 2>or he wants to be your sponsor.</v>

582
00:15:58.130 --> 00:16:00.980
<v Speaker 2>Fuck what I'm talking about.</v>

583
00:16:00.981 --> 00:16:04.310
<v Speaker 2>Probably a sees you as an opportunity to get back into the limelight.</v>

584
00:16:04.311 --> 00:16:08.540
<v Speaker 2>And B feels bad that he's still your fucking money maybe.</v>

585
00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:10.460
<v Speaker 2>And he might've been doing one of those,</v>

586
00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:11.323
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

587
00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:15.980
<v Speaker 2>12 step things where he's got to make some kind of reconcile affiliation with</v>
