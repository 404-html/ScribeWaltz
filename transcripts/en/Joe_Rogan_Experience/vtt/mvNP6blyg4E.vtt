19
00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.760
<v Speaker 2>He's a super nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does he get humor all?</v>

20
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.470
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He comes to comedy shows all the time.</v>

21
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.910
<v Speaker 2>It's a fucking big comedy fan because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>saw Doug,</v>

22
00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:58.930
<v Speaker 2>Stan Ho,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doug.</v>

23
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.960
<v Speaker 2>Doug's been friends with them too and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>said I've gone with him once and it just</v>

24
00:01:02.961 --> 00:01:06.110
<v Speaker 2>seemed like he dug was being hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just seemed like he didn't get it.</v>

25
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.000
<v Speaker 2>What was happening?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever seen him with Joey Diaz is</v>

26
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.770
<v Speaker 2>one of the funniest moments in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>history of radio.</v>

27
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.800
<v Speaker 2>They're like bizarro version.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He told Joey Diaz that um,</v>

28
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.820
<v Speaker 2>it was on the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where he fucked up because there</v>

29
00:01:20.821 --> 00:01:24.410
<v Speaker 2>was one part that we're dealing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're in Austin and we're in studio and</v>

30
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.720
<v Speaker 2>one part we were doing was on the radio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>radio,</v>

31
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.651
<v Speaker 2>radio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>radio.</v>

32
00:01:27.651 --> 00:01:28.371
<v Speaker 2>You can't swear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

33
00:01:28.371 --> 00:01:30.320
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this next part is going to be on the</v>

34
00:01:30.321 --> 00:01:31.154
<v Speaker 2>Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

35
00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can swear.</v>

36
00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.210
<v Speaker 2>Many of you shouldn't swear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't put it,</v>

37
00:01:34.211 --> 00:01:35.330
<v Speaker 2>but if you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's no big deal.</v>

38
00:01:35.331 --> 00:01:39.800
<v Speaker 2>No one's going to go to jail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So all of a sudden Joey Diaz realized as</v>

39
00:01:39.801 --> 00:01:42.260
<v Speaker 2>the flood gates are open.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he just,</v>

40
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:43.161
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

41
00:01:43.161 --> 00:01:44.600
<v Speaker 2>he's the funniest guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

42
00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.310
<v Speaker 2>Oh joke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not the funniest guy that's ever</v>

43
00:01:46.311 --> 00:01:47.770
<v Speaker 2>lived.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's in the top two or three.</v>

44
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:48.860
<v Speaker 2>So he is amazing.</v>

45
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.810
<v Speaker 3>Just goes off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm just sitting there red faced and</v>

46
00:01:52.811 --> 00:01:55.510
<v Speaker 3>crying and laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm laughing so hard.</v>

47
00:01:55.511 --> 00:02:00.490
<v Speaker 3>I can't breathe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he just had alex to do with it.</v>

48
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.380
<v Speaker 3>They know what to do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was trying to juggle it.</v>

49
00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.060
<v Speaker 3>You won't player Jimmy to this part of</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

50
00:02:07.061 --> 00:02:09.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just don't move.</v>

51
00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:11.460
<v Speaker 3>And he was dancing and singing and</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mexico.</v>

52
00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:12.640
<v Speaker 3>He's done oxygen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

53
00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.370
<v Speaker 3>not a junkie is a junkie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The junkie is a junkie.</v>

54
00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.890
<v Speaker 3>Everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't wake up singing dance and</v>

55
00:02:17.891 --> 00:02:20.380
<v Speaker 3>then he has oxygen tanks at night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something's not right.</v>

56
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.360
<v Speaker 3>Michael Jackson case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're worth more dead than what you are</v>

57
00:02:25.361 --> 00:02:26.350
<v Speaker 3>alive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You understand me?</v>

58
00:02:26.351 --> 00:02:28.770
<v Speaker 3>He and now they got a new record coming</v>
<v Speaker 3>out that no more.</v>

59
00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.800
<v Speaker 3>He's doing a tour next year with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>people from Vegas that jump up and down</v>

60
00:02:32.801 --> 00:02:36.850
<v Speaker 3>the blue band group,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's worth more now than he's ever</v>

61
00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.550
<v Speaker 3>been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Michael Jackson was up to me.</v>

62
00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:42.670
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

63
00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.500
<v Speaker 3>I smoke a little joint.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll break it down,</v>

64
00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.690
<v Speaker 3>break it down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he bought the music from Paul</v>

65
00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.970
<v Speaker 3>Mccartney back and all of a sudden they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They put Paul Mccartney,</v>

66
00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.470
<v Speaker 3>the soup bowl.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They tried to build up the Beatles to</v>

67
00:02:53.471 --> 00:02:55.780
<v Speaker 3>get to Jackson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>

<v Speaker 2>until joey finds out that the radio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see if he could find where it goes off</v>

74

<v Speaker 2>minutes,</v>

75
00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.620
<v Speaker 2>but he's screaming and yelling about</v>

<v Speaker 7>like you guys conduct shit about each</v>

235
00:10:48.181 --> 00:10:49.920
<v Speaker 7>other.</v>

237
00:10:51.721 --> 00:10:52.231
<v Speaker 7>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

238
00:10:52.231 --> 00:10:55.500
<v Speaker 7>that's the number one way that they</v>
<v Speaker 7>honestly like mainstream media and all</v>

239
00:10:55.501 --> 00:10:57.510
<v Speaker 7>this shit lies to us.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's just ignoring stuff.</v>

240
00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:59.700
<v Speaker 7>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's not usually flat out lies.</v>

241
00:10:59.701 --> 00:11:00.810
<v Speaker 7>It's just we're not going to talk about</v>
<v Speaker 7>it.</v>

242
00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:02.350
<v Speaker 7>I'll tell you what,</v>

243
00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:06.110
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There was a really impressive moment</v>

244
00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.540
<v Speaker 6>where I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was really impressed with Obama as a</v>

245
00:11:08.541 --> 00:11:12.590
<v Speaker 6>person where he was at this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they were doing this campaign speech and</v>

246
00:11:12.591 --> 00:11:16.580
<v Speaker 6>this guy that trump supporter was in the</v>
<v Speaker 6>crowd and this guy was a throwing a flag</v>

247
00:11:16.581 --> 00:11:21.020
<v Speaker 6>up there is a trump flag and waving and</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's an older guy and he had like some</v>

248
00:11:21.021 --> 00:11:23.560
<v Speaker 6>sort of military outfit on and he's</v>
<v Speaker 6>yelling out,</v>

249
00:11:23.561 --> 00:11:25.820
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>trump and he's kind of sign up and all</v>

250
00:11:25.821 --> 00:11:28.970
<v Speaker 6>these people are billing and Obama stops</v>
<v Speaker 6>him and he goes and he goes,</v>

251
00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:30.350
<v Speaker 6>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he goes,</v>

252
00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:33.080
<v Speaker 6>this is a gentleman,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's an older gentleman.</v>

253
00:11:33.081 --> 00:11:35.960
<v Speaker 6>We should respect our elders,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so let's think about that.</v>

254
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:37.940
<v Speaker 6>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and it looks like he's done some</v>

255
00:11:37.941 --> 00:11:40.880
<v Speaker 6>military service,</v>
<v Speaker 6>has got a military so we should respect</v>

256
00:11:40.881 --> 00:11:43.720
<v Speaker 6>our veterans.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then he got it,</v>

257
00:11:43.721 --> 00:11:44.930
<v Speaker 6>got to the singles.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He goes,</v>

258
00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:49.560
<v Speaker 6>don't boo vote,</v>
<v Speaker 6>don't vote videos.</v>

259
00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:50.640
<v Speaker 6>We respect freedom</v>

260
00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:53.010
<v Speaker 7>speech like don't boo this map.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

261
00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:54.280
<v Speaker 7>I</v>

262
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.960
<v Speaker 5>liked that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the whole respect,</v>

263
00:11:55.961 --> 00:11:59.350
<v Speaker 5>the veterans thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you don't fucking fund their</v>

264
00:11:59.351 --> 00:12:00.970
<v Speaker 5>medical care,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when they get home,</v>

265
00:12:00.971 --> 00:12:02.680
<v Speaker 5>we treat them like shit and then they</v>
<v Speaker 5>go,</v>

266
00:12:02.681 --> 00:12:03.610
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>respect them though.</v>

267
00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:05.620
<v Speaker 5>Like you're totally right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're totally right.</v>

268
00:12:05.621 --> 00:12:06.460
<v Speaker 5>It drives me nuts</v>

269
00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:11.240
<v Speaker 4>more in a leadership role or as a</v>
<v Speaker 4>respect someone for like the way to</v>

270
00:12:11.241 --> 00:12:13.380
<v Speaker 4>handle a delicate situation like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

271
00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:17.000
<v Speaker 4>I agree with that because I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean ultimately you do have to be</v>

272
00:12:17.001 --> 00:12:19.790
<v Speaker 4>concerned and we've been talking about</v>
<v Speaker 4>this with the whole trump thing.</v>

273
00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:24.140
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to be concerned as much</v>
<v Speaker 4>about what trump's going to be able to</v>

274
00:12:24.141 --> 00:12:29.141
<v Speaker 4>do as you do about people that see trump</v>
<v Speaker 4>in office and they getting bold and to</v>

275
00:12:29.541 --> 00:12:33.590
<v Speaker 4>be assholes because I really think that</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's some people that are on the</v>

276
00:12:33.591 --> 00:12:36.880
<v Speaker 4>fucking fence to asshole fence go one</v>
<v Speaker 4>way or another.</v>

277
00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:38.620
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then they might go full asshole,</v>

278
00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:42.460
<v Speaker 5>full asshole doors open.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not trump's fault.</v>

279
00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:45.700
<v Speaker 5>It's not trump's fault,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's a reality of being the person</v>

280
00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:48.940
<v Speaker 5>who's setting the tone for the way the</v>
<v Speaker 5>country thinks of itself.</v>

281
00:12:48.941 --> 00:12:49.960
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh absolutely.</v>

282
00:12:49.961 --> 00:12:53.170
<v Speaker 5>And here's part of the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the maybe the positive of having someone</v>

283
00:12:53.171 --> 00:12:56.470
<v Speaker 5>like trump in the presidency is this</v>
<v Speaker 5>country,</v>

284
00:12:56.471 --> 00:12:57.490
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

285
00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:01.390
<v Speaker 5>racism being an ass hole,</v>
<v Speaker 5>treating people like shit that's been</v>

286
00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:05.560
<v Speaker 5>part of this country,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that is as long as we didn't have a</v>

287
00:13:05.561 --> 00:13:08.020
<v Speaker 5>leader that you didn't think represented</v>
<v Speaker 5>that people were like,</v>

288
00:13:08.021 --> 00:13:08.501
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

289
00:13:08.501 --> 00:13:12.910
<v Speaker 5>we'll just keep going at this rate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whereas now people like are looking at</v>

290
00:13:12.911 --> 00:13:15.220
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe we needed this ugly orange face as</v>

291
00:13:15.221 --> 00:13:17.440
<v Speaker 5>the face of things to really be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

292
00:13:17.441 --> 00:13:20.890
<v Speaker 5>what is going on with the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with the xenophobia and the racism and</v>

293
00:13:20.891 --> 00:13:21.850
<v Speaker 5>what is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what is the deal,</v>

294
00:13:21.851 --> 00:13:22.750
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we needed that face.</v>

295
00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:23.890
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it definitely it.</v>

296
00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:26.280
<v Speaker 4>It highlights the fact that it's a giant</v>
<v Speaker 4>issue still.</v>

297
00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:28.800
<v Speaker 4>People that don't think it's an issue</v>
<v Speaker 4>because they don't see it in front of</v>

298
00:13:28.801 --> 00:13:32.040
<v Speaker 4>their face that you're forced to look at</v>
<v Speaker 4>it now it doesn't,</v>

299
00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:34.740
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is something that Alonzo Bowden</v>

300
00:13:34.741 --> 00:13:38.610
<v Speaker 4>said during the young Turks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a coverage of the election that was so</v>

301
00:13:38.611 --> 00:13:39.870
<v Speaker 4>on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

302
00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:42.510
<v Speaker 4>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not all trump supporters are racist,</v>

303
00:13:42.511 --> 00:13:47.511
<v Speaker 4>but all racists are trump supporters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That he nailed it.</v>

304
00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.250
<v Speaker 4>Is there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not racist,</v>

305
00:13:50.251 --> 00:13:53.850
<v Speaker 4>but he has a number one with racists</v>
<v Speaker 4>racists or voted for Hillary.</v>

306
00:13:56.930 --> 00:13:59.210
<v Speaker 4>She get in that boat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

307
00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:00.600
<v Speaker 4>it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

308
00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:02.490
<v Speaker 4>It's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a great point.</v>

309
00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:05.250
<v Speaker 4>It's dead on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's you.</v>

310
00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.500
<v Speaker 4>GotTa worry about the tone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

311
00:14:07.501 --> 00:14:10.950
<v Speaker 4>it sounds ridiculous to someone who's</v>
<v Speaker 4>like got sovereignty,</v>

312
00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:14.070
<v Speaker 4>someone with personal sovereignty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody who knows who they are and</v>

313
00:14:14.071 --> 00:14:16.220
<v Speaker 4>isn't so easily swayed and like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not gonna.</v>

314
00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:18.930
<v Speaker 4>Make me an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It probably won't make you an asshole.</v>

315
00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:19.830
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But there's,</v>

316
00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:20.990
<v Speaker 4>there's a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

317
00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:23.040
<v Speaker 4>that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a bunch of those guys.</v>

318
00:14:23.041 --> 00:14:27.350
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of disenfranchised men out</v>
<v Speaker 4>there and this is where</v>

319
00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:28.680
<v Speaker 5>I really put it on on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

320
00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:33.230
<v Speaker 5>the mainstream media is they legitimize</v>
<v Speaker 5>some of the shit that trump says or</v>

321
00:14:33.231 --> 00:14:36.980
<v Speaker 5>whatever trump supporters say that is</v>
<v Speaker 5>just crackpot nuts.</v>

322
00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:40.730
<v Speaker 5>Like when CNN had the Kyron that said</v>
<v Speaker 5>are Jews people?</v>

323
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:42.660
<v Speaker 5>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh you didn't hear about this.</v>

324
00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:44.210
<v Speaker 5>And it went kind of viral.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were,</v>

325
00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:45.140
<v Speaker 5>they were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

326
00:14:45.141 --> 00:14:48.580
<v Speaker 5>this crazy white supremacists,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or maybe there's someone in Toronto</v>

327
00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:52.220
<v Speaker 5>having something to do with trump said</v>
<v Speaker 5>has in past question</v>

328
00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:55.430
<v Speaker 7>whether Jews or people or something,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so then they run with the chirons says</v>

329
00:14:55.431 --> 00:14:56.390
<v Speaker 7>are Jews people?</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>

330
00:14:56.450 --> 00:14:58.010
<v Speaker 7>well now this is a legitimate</v>
<v Speaker 7>discussion.</v>

331
00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:00.050
<v Speaker 7>You just made this a legitimate</v>
<v Speaker 7>discussion.</v>

332
00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:03.830
<v Speaker 7>Instead of just ignoring it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Instead they're like,</v>

333
00:15:03.831 --> 00:15:05.300
<v Speaker 7>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 7>let's have a panel to discuss.</v>

334
00:15:05.301 --> 00:15:06.470
<v Speaker 7>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you smell funny.</v>

335
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:08.330
<v Speaker 7>It's a human.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Legitimize this shit.</v>

336
00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:11.180
<v Speaker 7>If Jews are people,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there you go,</v>

337
00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:14.960
<v Speaker 7>so fucking stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That sounds like if someone gave the</v>

338
00:15:14.961 --> 00:15:17.620
<v Speaker 7>news to people in the 15 hundreds and</v>
<v Speaker 7>said,</v>

339
00:15:17.621 --> 00:15:18.880
<v Speaker 7>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's time.</v>

340
00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:22.340
<v Speaker 7>This is a new technology.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you imagine if he gave it to people</v>

341
00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:24.710
<v Speaker 7>are just people.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm not sure</v>

342
00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:30.380
<v Speaker 7>that's something we should discuss.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Let's sit down.</v>

343
00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:33.210
<v Speaker 7>Talk about this.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What kind of people discuss where</v>

344
00:15:33.211 --> 00:15:34.070
<v Speaker 7>they're not?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Usually people are like,</v>

345
00:15:34.071 --> 00:15:35.990
<v Speaker 7>what else is Santa Claus Real?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Is that next?</v>

346
00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:38.750
<v Speaker 7>What about Rudolph?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Was he a real character or is that a</v>

347
00:15:38.751 --> 00:15:42.370
<v Speaker 7>mythical creature?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Is he an analogy as enl allegory?</v>

348
00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:44.020
<v Speaker 7>What is he?</v>
<v Speaker 7>They gave $5,</v>

349
00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:47.120
<v Speaker 7>million dollars of free coverage to</v>
<v Speaker 7>trump twice as much as hillary in the</v>

350
00:15:47.121 --> 00:15:49.250
<v Speaker 7>primaries,</v>
<v Speaker 7>23 times as much as Bernie,</v>

351
00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:52.510
<v Speaker 7>and they wonder how trump got elected.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like help themselves.</v>

352
00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:55.360
<v Speaker 7>He was a master at manipulating them in</v>
<v Speaker 7>that regard.</v>

353
00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:58.880
<v Speaker 7>Say controversial things,</v>
<v Speaker 7>whether it was on purpose or not.</v>

354
00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:00.110
<v Speaker 7>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Jesus Christ,</v>

355

<v Speaker 7>fully.</v>
<v Speaker 7>God dammit.</v>

356
00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:02.180
<v Speaker 7>People could die.</v>

357
00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:06.910
<v Speaker 6>You're.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're the first guest to do that.</v>

358
00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:09.370
<v Speaker 6>I'm a fuck load of time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Shit.</v>

359
00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:12.670
<v Speaker 6>I've wrecked at least two laptops on the</v>
<v Speaker 6>show live.</v>

360
00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:14.193
<v Speaker 6>We're good,</v>
<v Speaker 6>dude.</v>

361
00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:16.250
<v Speaker 7>It.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I just did it.</v>

362
00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:19.370
<v Speaker 7>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What a cluster fuck here.</v>

363
00:16:19.371 --> 00:16:20.920
<v Speaker 7>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 7>at least she knows.</v>

364
00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:25.030
<v Speaker 7>That's a good host is you wanted to make</v>
<v Speaker 7>me feel better about.</v>

365
00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:29.400
<v Speaker 6>I'm just a slob.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Clumsy Dork,</v>

366
00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:31.440
<v Speaker 6>but we're good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Nothing got zapped.</v>

367
00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:34.110
<v Speaker 6>We're good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We were just talking about</v>

368
00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:37.300
<v Speaker 7>country.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Trump and media.</v>

369
00:16:37.301 --> 00:16:38.470
<v Speaker 7>The endless media coverage</v>

370
00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:41.100
<v Speaker 6>can awesome job,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you know what?</v>

371
00:16:41.101 --> 00:16:43.650
<v Speaker 6>There's the possibility,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like I would like to think that we</v>

372
00:16:43.651 --> 00:16:48.120
<v Speaker 6>watched some genius chess play by a</v>
<v Speaker 6>master of the media,</v>

373
00:16:48.121 --> 00:16:49.380
<v Speaker 6>which he most certainly is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

374
00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:51.600
<v Speaker 6>I had a guy absolutely television</v>
<v Speaker 6>forever,</v>

375
00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:53.000
<v Speaker 6>but</v>

376
00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.040
<v Speaker 7>I really wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 7>do you,</v>

377
00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:55.790
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>do you have thoughts on who he,</v>

378
00:16:55.791 --> 00:16:58.400
<v Speaker 7>what he genuinely believes?</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's the question.</v>

379
00:16:58.401 --> 00:16:59.040
<v Speaker 7>No idea.</v>

380
00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:00.690
<v Speaker 6>I thought that was my question.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was going to say,</v>

381
00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:05.130
<v Speaker 6>do you think that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Did we watch a master manipulator or did</v>

382
00:17:05.131 --> 00:17:08.150
<v Speaker 6>he just get lucky that his personality</v>
<v Speaker 6>like totally works right now?</v>

383
00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:11.730
<v Speaker 6>Now like that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>everything is lined up for you to be the</v>

384
00:17:11.731 --> 00:17:13.190
<v Speaker 6>guy that says,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

385
00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:15.030
<v Speaker 6>you should grab chips by the pussy and</v>
<v Speaker 6>everything goes.</v>

386
00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:16.290
<v Speaker 6>That's locker room talk.</v>

387
00:17:16.590 --> 00:17:18.120
<v Speaker 7>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think it's a little bit of both.</v>

388
00:17:18.121 --> 00:17:23.010
<v Speaker 7>I think it's the perfect time for him</v>
<v Speaker 7>combined with a great manipulation.</v>

389
00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:25.410
<v Speaker 7>Here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if you didn't have people struggling so</v>

390
00:17:25.411 --> 00:17:26.880
<v Speaker 7>hard,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if you didn't have this quote unquote</v>

391
00:17:26.881 --> 00:17:29.580
<v Speaker 7>recovery all going to the top one</v>
<v Speaker 7>percent,</v>

392
00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:33.660
<v Speaker 7>people wouldn't have gotten behind this.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You needed a populace that is furious</v>

393
00:17:33.661 --> 00:17:36.450
<v Speaker 7>and struggling and miserable to get</v>
<v Speaker 7>behind this.</v>

394
00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:39.030
<v Speaker 7>Isn't that weird?</v>
<v Speaker 7>A populace that is furious and</v>

395
00:17:39.031 --> 00:17:42.370
<v Speaker 7>struggling and miserable wants to get</v>
<v Speaker 7>behind a dude who's a billionaire is</v>

396
00:17:42.371 --> 00:17:44.990
<v Speaker 7>probably</v>
<v Speaker 7>get there.</v>

397
00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:47.870
<v Speaker 7>I mean the whole thing is like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

398
00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:50.070
<v Speaker 7>how much tooth Fang</v>

399
00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:54.030
<v Speaker 2>and claw competition in businesses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy had been involved in probably a</v>

400
00:17:54.031 --> 00:17:54.960
<v Speaker 2>fuck load.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

401
00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:57.660
<v Speaker 2>It sounds like every deal he's ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>signed,</v>

402
00:17:57.661 --> 00:18:00.690
<v Speaker 2>he reneges on like half of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's hilarious.</v>

403
00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:01.880
<v Speaker 2>Like when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they were talking to him,</v>

404
00:18:01.881 --> 00:18:05.560
<v Speaker 2>but during the debate when Hillary to</v>
<v Speaker 2>brought up the taxes and not pay any</v>

405
00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:07.400
<v Speaker 2>taxes because I'm smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

406
00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:07.840
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

407
00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:09.000
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he got away with it,</v>

408
00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:10.500
<v Speaker 2>but you know why he gets away with it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause he goes,</v>

409
00:18:10.501 --> 00:18:12.240
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those laws shouldn't be there.</v>

410
00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:14.970
<v Speaker 2>But since they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to not use them.</v>

411
00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:16.410
<v Speaker 2>Of course I'm going to use them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

412
00:18:16.411 --> 00:18:18.870
<v Speaker 2>but let's take them out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's take those logs out.</v>

413
00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:23.130
<v Speaker 2>People wanted someone who just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck the system,</v>

414
00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:25.410
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which it's hilarious that you then get</v>

415
00:18:25.411 --> 00:18:27.960
<v Speaker 2>behind a billionaire is the guy who's</v>
<v Speaker 2>gonna say fuck the system.</v>

416
00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:30.510
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's also a populist.</v>

417
00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:31.500
<v Speaker 2>That's what's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

418
00:18:31.501 --> 00:18:33.580
<v Speaker 2>he likes to be popular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

419
00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:37.350
<v Speaker 2>and you have a unique opportunity with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy like him or I don't think he's gonna</v>

420
00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:43.040
<v Speaker 2>be as influenced by other people as</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've had presidents before.</v>

421
00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:44.700
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've had presidents before they get</v>

422
00:18:44.701 --> 00:18:46.290
<v Speaker 2>into the office and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

423
00:18:46.291 --> 00:18:47.640
<v Speaker 2>this guy's not doing anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

424
00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:48.430
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me know.</v>

425
00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:49.263
<v Speaker 2>Say who they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

426
00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:52.350
<v Speaker 2>Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of them.</v>

427
00:18:52.351 --> 00:18:54.660
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

428
00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:58.390
<v Speaker 2>but this is the first time a guy has</v>
<v Speaker 2>gotten in that like the,</v>

429
00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:01.200
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the party itself doesn't even want them</v>

430
00:19:01.201 --> 00:19:03.270
<v Speaker 2>in there when they were trying to force</v>
<v Speaker 2>them out,</v>

431
00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:05.850
<v Speaker 2>like everybody didn't want them in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody was saying,</v>

432
00:19:05.851 --> 00:19:07.300
<v Speaker 2>there's no way we can lift this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

433
00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:12.000
<v Speaker 2>Basically the Republicans tried to rig</v>
<v Speaker 2>their primary to beat trump and failed</v>

434
00:19:12.001 --> 00:19:14.280
<v Speaker 2>the democrats rigged to their primary</v>
<v Speaker 2>and succeeded.</v>

435
00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:15.720
<v Speaker 2>That was the only difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

436
00:19:15.721 --> 00:19:17.040
<v Speaker 2>It's fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

437
00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:19.470
<v Speaker 2>Like they fucked over that Bernie</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sanders guy.</v>

438
00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:21.360
<v Speaker 2>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on every level we,</v>

439
00:19:21.361 --> 00:19:23.670
<v Speaker 2>I covered this unredacted and I like</v>
<v Speaker 2>endlessly.</v>

440
00:19:23.671 --> 00:19:25.110
<v Speaker 2>I just couldn't get enough of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

441
00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:27.060
<v Speaker 2>it was like on every was like voter</v>
<v Speaker 2>suppression,</v>

442
00:19:27.061 --> 00:19:28.730
<v Speaker 2>closing polling places,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

443
00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:32.580
<v Speaker 2>x opposed aren't matching up just at</v>
<v Speaker 2>media manipulation 23 times as much</v>

444
00:19:32.581 --> 00:19:35.580
<v Speaker 2>coverage as I was saying for trump and</v>
<v Speaker 2>and like 10 times as much coverage for</v>

445
00:19:35.581 --> 00:19:38.610
<v Speaker 2>Hillary as Bernie Sanders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just like an every level they</v>

446
00:19:38.611 --> 00:19:42.390
<v Speaker 2>tried to force through their candidate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would have been great.</v>

447
00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:44.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think Bernie would have been really</v>

448
00:19:44.761 --> 00:19:47.310
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think Bernie running against trump</v>

449
00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:50.880
<v Speaker 2>would have been way less vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a,</v>

450
00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:52.990
<v Speaker 2>he had way less skeletons in the closet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

451
00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:55.710
<v Speaker 2>He was pretty much an open book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He also didn't,</v>

452
00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:58.290
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had immense like compared to hillary</v>

453
00:19:58.291 --> 00:19:59.640
<v Speaker 2>immense unfavorability numbers.</v>

454
00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:02.510
<v Speaker 2>Whereas Hillary just had crazy</v>
<v Speaker 2>unfavorability.</v>

455
00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:05.610
<v Speaker 2>Well he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he represented character to us.</v>

456
00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:08.880
<v Speaker 2>Thirty years of saying the 30,</v>
<v Speaker 2>40 years of saying the same stuff.</v>

457
00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:11.430
<v Speaker 2>Whereas Hillary from week to week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you didn't know what she stood for.</v>

458
00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:13.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even the way looks,</v>

459
00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:16.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he represents character.</v>

460
00:20:16.561 --> 00:20:18.000
<v Speaker 2>He represents this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

461
00:20:18.001 --> 00:20:19.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>disheveled,</v>

462
00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:23.820
<v Speaker 2>really smart guy with his glasses and</v>
<v Speaker 2>his jacket and he's not trying to look</v>

463
00:20:23.821 --> 00:20:25.710
<v Speaker 2>good at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't have any orange makeup on.</v>

464
00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:26.611
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>

465
00:20:26.611 --> 00:20:31.470
<v Speaker 2>The polar opposite of trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would love a guy that cares more about</v>

466
00:20:31.471 --> 00:20:33.510
<v Speaker 2>getting shit done than his hair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would love that.</v>

467
00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:37.350
<v Speaker 2>Also seems to care about people whether</v>
<v Speaker 2>you agree with them or not.</v>

468
00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:39.510
<v Speaker 2>I think that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he genuinely cares about people.</v>

469
00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:41.670
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully I'm not getting bullshitted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

470
00:20:41.671 --> 00:20:44.340
<v Speaker 2>because he is a politician.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's how you know a little something</v>

471
00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:48.100
<v Speaker 2>is you don't spend 30 years in</v>
<v Speaker 2>government and not</v>

472
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:52.810
<v Speaker 5>get rich unless you've got other goals.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like everybody has been in Congress</v>

473
00:20:52.811 --> 00:20:54.470
<v Speaker 5>that long is a multimillionaire.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hinton.</v>

474
00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:55.140
<v Speaker 5>He's not</v>

475
00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:56.310
<v Speaker 2>waste from Vermont,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

476
00:20:56.370 --> 00:20:57.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're all hippies up there.</v>

477
00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:00.990
<v Speaker 2>They're all hippies and farmers in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vermont is weird.</v>

478
00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:04.980
<v Speaker 2>I had been going on a bunch of Ben and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jerry's Vermont to too.</v>

479
00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:07.380
<v Speaker 2>It's so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's great.</v>

480
00:21:07.410 --> 00:21:10.500
<v Speaker 2>Don't get me wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is a great place like Burlington.</v>

481
00:21:11.010 --> 00:21:13.500
<v Speaker 2>That place is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did a gig up there once.</v>

482
00:21:13.501 --> 00:21:14.161
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

483
00:21:14.161 --> 00:21:16.110
<v Speaker 2>this is like a little frozen paradise up</v>
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

484
00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:21.570
<v Speaker 2>like this little small town of like</v>
<v Speaker 2>hippie people and they always go against</v>

485
00:21:21.571 --> 00:21:24.480
<v Speaker 2>whatever's going on around them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you get like a group?</v>

486
00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:26.340
<v Speaker 2>Is that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has to be a university town.</v>

487
00:21:26.341 --> 00:21:30.030
<v Speaker 2>It's the only way you get like a group</v>
<v Speaker 2>of liberals in a mountain.</v>

488
00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:30.970
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

489
00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:31.960
<v Speaker 5>Well they uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

490
00:21:31.961 --> 00:21:34.390
<v Speaker 5>and then into,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean guesses universities there too,</v>

491
00:21:34.391 --> 00:21:37.150
<v Speaker 5>but in some of these southern towns it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>just like they all fleet to one city.</v>

492
00:21:37.151 --> 00:21:38.410
<v Speaker 5>It's like Asheville,</v>
<v Speaker 5>North Carolina,</v>

493
00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:39.940
<v Speaker 5>just like we got to get together.</v>

494
00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:42.650
<v Speaker 2>But that's the university too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where Duncan went to school.</v>

495
00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:46.730
<v Speaker 2>Asheville's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>

496
00:21:46.731 --> 00:21:50.720
<v Speaker 2>It's such a great little town the best</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now like the people are so cool.</v>

497
00:21:50.721 --> 00:21:54.890
<v Speaker 2>It's like you guys are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you took like 30,000 of the best</v>

498
00:21:54.891 --> 00:21:57.770
<v Speaker 2>people from Austin and brought them in</v>
<v Speaker 2>North Carolina,</v>

499
00:21:58.130 --> 00:21:59.600
<v Speaker 2>that's what Asheville is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

500
00:21:59.601 --> 00:22:01.610
<v Speaker 2>what are you guys doing here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this is weird,</v>

501
00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:05.390
<v Speaker 2>really cool bars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody walks around.</v>

502
00:22:05.391 --> 00:22:05.560
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

503
00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:08.200
<v Speaker 5>But played there like six months ago and</v>
<v Speaker 5>I told them,</v>

504
00:22:08.201 --> 00:22:10.360
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you guys should build a wall around the</v>

505
00:22:10.361 --> 00:22:13.210
<v Speaker 5>city.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's great here.</v>

506
00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:15.220
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the.</v>

507
00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:16.220
<v Speaker 5>The area outside of it.</v>

508
00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:19.320
<v Speaker 2>It's very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's still parts of this country that</v>

509
00:22:19.321 --> 00:22:22.190
<v Speaker 2>haven't recovered from the civil war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

510
00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:23.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

511
00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:24.510
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

512
00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:27.110
<v Speaker 2>there's parts of this country we were</v>
<v Speaker 2>driving through and we'll.</v>

513
00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:31.940
<v Speaker 2>You'll run into small towns that still</v>
<v Speaker 2>have like the vague echoes of the city.</v>

514
00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:33.740
<v Speaker 5>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I grew up in Richmond,</v>

515
00:22:33.741 --> 00:22:35.720
<v Speaker 5>Virginia.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm named after Robert e Dot Lee.</v>

516
00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:36.940
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I went.</v>

517
00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:37.550
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

518
00:22:37.550 --> 00:22:40.130
<v Speaker 5>My high school,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my high school was the confederate</v>

519
00:22:40.131 --> 00:22:41.670
<v Speaker 5>rebels.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whole Mascot.</v>

520
00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:43.910

<v Speaker 5>Rebel flag.</v>

521
00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:45.980
<v Speaker 5>We had a rebel flag the first year I was</v>
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

522
00:22:45.981 --> 00:22:48.830
<v Speaker 5>Then they finally decided that it was a</v>
<v Speaker 5>offensive.</v>

523
00:22:48.831 --> 00:22:51.980
<v Speaker 5>So they took away the flag but kept the</v>
<v Speaker 5>rebel soldiers the fast.</v>

524
00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:54.380
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

<v Speaker 7>Richmond,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Virginia,</v>

551
00:23:48.501 --> 00:23:51.350
<v Speaker 7>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was 12 before anyone mentioned we lost</v>

552
00:23:51.351 --> 00:23:53.300
<v Speaker 7>the civil war.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That was like,</v>

<v Speaker 7>we didn't win.</v>

554
00:23:54.930 --> 00:23:57.920
<v Speaker 7>So you knew there was a civil war,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but you didn't know that the south lost?</v>

555
00:23:58.460 --> 00:23:59.211
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

<v Speaker 7>because it's because it's talked about</v>

557
00:24:00.711 --> 00:24:02.570
<v Speaker 7>like uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like almost like a victory because they</v>

558
00:24:02.571 --> 00:24:05.420
<v Speaker 7>talk about it like all the grand old</v>
<v Speaker 7>times of civil war and stuff like that.</v>

559
00:24:05.421 --> 00:24:06.500

<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

560

<v Speaker 7>and I was like,</v>

561
00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:08.151
<v Speaker 7>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>wait,</v>

562
00:24:08.151 --> 00:24:13.151
<v Speaker 7>we lost what</v>
<v Speaker 7>all the monument avenue in Richmond,</v>

563
00:24:13.701 --> 00:24:17.840
<v Speaker 7>Virginia is basically all civil war,</v>
<v Speaker 7>quote unquote heroes meaning the losers.</v>

564
00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:19.543
<v Speaker 7>Wow.</v>

565
00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:24.410
<v Speaker 7>It's crazy that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that was so recent that 18,</v>

566
00:24:24.411 --> 00:24:29.411
<v Speaker 7>65 was so recent 100 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There was like slavery pretty much.</v>

567
00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:33.120
<v Speaker 7>Pretty close in 1916.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean there's probably,</v>

568
00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:34.610
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's slavery now.</v>

569
00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:36.070
<v Speaker 7>It's been that long.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well yeah,</v>

570
00:24:36.210 --> 00:24:38.180
<v Speaker 7>they're asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's the craziest thing.</v>

571
00:24:38.181 --> 00:24:40.100
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's not slavery now necessarily in</v>

572
00:24:40.101 --> 00:24:43.100
<v Speaker 7>America,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but there's more slaves in the world now</v>

573
00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:45.830
<v Speaker 7>because there's more people also.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There are,</v>

574
00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:49.070
<v Speaker 7>there are more black people in prison</v>
<v Speaker 7>right now than the were slaves during</v>

575
00:24:49.071 --> 00:24:51.320
<v Speaker 7>the civil war.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We imprison so many people and those</v>

576
00:24:51.321 --> 00:24:54.260
<v Speaker 7>people are largely,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a lot of them are forced to labor for</v>

577
00:24:54.261 --> 00:24:54.891
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

578
00:24:54.891 --> 00:24:56.630
<v Speaker 7>a nickel an hour or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So we,</v>

579
00:24:56.810 --> 00:24:58.430
<v Speaker 7>because we have a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we have a stipulation in the</v>

580
00:24:58.431 --> 00:25:00.680
<v Speaker 7>constitution that you can have slavery</v>
<v Speaker 7>as long as they're in prison.</v>

581
00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:03.860
<v Speaker 7>We've been talking about that a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's apparently there's a documentary</v>

582
00:25:03.861 --> 00:25:04.850
<v Speaker 7>about that on Netflix.</v>

583
00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:06.170
<v Speaker 7>Thirteenth.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Did you see it?</v>

584
00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:07.460
<v Speaker 7>How is it?</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's great.</v>

585
00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:09.740
<v Speaker 7>I keep hearing it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I get real close to and I go,</v>

586
00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:11.480
<v Speaker 7>God damn.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I haven't caught up on narcos.</v>

587
00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:13.350
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I it,</v>

588
00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:16.370
<v Speaker 7>but I got like one episode left and no</v>
<v Speaker 7>need to be entertained.</v>

589
00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:17.570
<v Speaker 7>I want to watch westworld.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Sorry.</v>

590
00:25:17.790 --> 00:25:20.990
<v Speaker 7>It's not looking good for Escobar.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's not looking good man.</v>

591
00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:24.260
<v Speaker 7>I'm worried what's going to have to.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But he is the star of the show.</v>

592
00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:27.260
<v Speaker 7>How are you going to have another</v>
<v Speaker 7>season?</v>

593
00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:30.890
<v Speaker 7>Just seems like he's digging a hole for</v>
<v Speaker 7>himself and he's just not going to come</v>

594
00:25:30.891 --> 00:25:33.350
<v Speaker 7>out.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He should start treating people better.</v>

595
00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:35.600
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you keep killing people.</v>

596
00:25:35.601 --> 00:25:38.390
<v Speaker 7>Eventually someone's going to kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's just what I think.</v>

597
00:25:38.410 --> 00:25:40.400
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he just said thank you a little more</v>

598
00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:41.540
<v Speaker 7>please.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And thank you.</v>

599
00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:47.050
<v Speaker 7>It is absolutely insane that you can</v>
<v Speaker 7>have a minimum wage except when you've</v>

600
00:25:47.751 --> 00:25:49.940
<v Speaker 7>trapped someone for a crime.</v>

601
00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:53.120
<v Speaker 7>Then not only do they have to pay for</v>
<v Speaker 7>that crime by being incarcerated,</v>

602
00:25:53.121 --> 00:25:56.460
<v Speaker 7>but then they have to work and make</v>
<v Speaker 7>pennies to it.</v>

603
00:25:56.461 --> 00:25:58.870
<v Speaker 7>It is such a.</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's such a game like that.</v>

604
00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:02.600
<v Speaker 7>Another great book by T v is the divide</v>
<v Speaker 7>talks about this.</v>

605
00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:04.580
<v Speaker 7>It's like it's like Matt,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Matt,</v>

606
00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:07.290
<v Speaker 7>Matt Taibbi.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Then the cops just running.</v>

607
00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:10.400
<v Speaker 7>They'll run around,</v>
<v Speaker 7>look for mostly black people standing on</v>

608
00:26:10.401 --> 00:26:12.160
<v Speaker 7>the corner sometimes in front of their</v>
<v Speaker 7>own apartment,</v>

609
00:26:12.290 --> 00:26:16.190
<v Speaker 7>charge them for loitering or something</v>
<v Speaker 7>and then and then they take a plea deal</v>

610
00:26:16.191 --> 00:26:17.390
<v Speaker 7>because they're told like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Hey,</v>

611
00:26:17.391 --> 00:26:20.450
<v Speaker 7>do you want months of a trial where you</v>
<v Speaker 7>could spend a year in jail or do you</v>

612
00:26:20.451 --> 00:26:23.420
<v Speaker 7>want to take this plea deal and just</v>
<v Speaker 7>have a tiny charge until they all take</v>

613
00:26:23.421 --> 00:26:25.760
<v Speaker 7>the collegial.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So now they're in the system and it's</v>

614
00:26:25.761 --> 00:26:29.720
<v Speaker 7>just designed as this railroading so</v>
<v Speaker 7>crazy.</v>

615
00:26:30.170 --> 00:26:34.370
<v Speaker 7>It's so crazy that people have made an</v>
<v Speaker 7>industry off of like there's money to be</v>

616
00:26:34.371 --> 00:26:37.910
<v Speaker 7>made from keeping people locked up.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's just the way that we have allowed</v>

617
00:26:37.911 --> 00:26:41.600
<v Speaker 7>that to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's so shameful because it's sort of</v>

618
00:26:41.601 --> 00:26:44.130
<v Speaker 7>just everybody sort of woke up as adults</v>

619
00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:44.963
<v Speaker 2>and was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

620
00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:47.230
<v Speaker 2>How many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many private prisons are that we</v>

621
00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:48.540
<v Speaker 2>make?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many people are in jail?</v>

622
00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:50.880
<v Speaker 2>We didn't even know what percentage of</v>
<v Speaker 2>who or what.</v>

623
00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:53.340
<v Speaker 2>We're five percent of the world's</v>
<v Speaker 2>population.</v>

624
00:26:53.341 --> 00:26:55.050
<v Speaker 2>Twenty five percent of the world's</v>
<v Speaker 2>prisoners.</v>

625
00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:59.730
<v Speaker 2>We have way more prisoners than any</v>
<v Speaker 2>country and it's all like it's going on</v>

626
00:26:59.731 --> 00:27:01.290
<v Speaker 2>without us looking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

627
00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:04.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not obviously for violent</v>

628
00:27:04.231 --> 00:27:06.390
<v Speaker 2>crimes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let's just talk about the nonviolent</v>

629
00:27:06.391 --> 00:27:06.850
<v Speaker 2>ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

630
00:27:06.850 --> 00:27:09.310
<v Speaker 2>It isn't that like 50 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

631
00:27:09.311 --> 00:27:11.670
<v Speaker 2>it's a huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most people in prison are nonviolent,</v>

632
00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:15.420
<v Speaker 2>so 50 percent of them are locked up in</v>
<v Speaker 2>jail for something nonviolent.</v>

633
00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:17.730
<v Speaker 2>And then what percentage those are</v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs,</v>

634
00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:18.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's.</v>

635
00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:19.441
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot.</v>

636
00:27:19.441 --> 00:27:22.260
<v Speaker 2>A lot of this has to do with a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>this has to do with the drug wars.</v>

637
00:27:22.261 --> 00:27:23.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean</v>

638
00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:28.770
<v Speaker 2>I think like deft and obviously all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>violent crimes,</v>

639
00:27:28.771 --> 00:27:31.950
<v Speaker 2>but all those things that they sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>rationalizes you need some sort of</v>

640
00:27:31.951 --> 00:27:33.970
<v Speaker 2>punishment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but has anybody ever even proven the</v>

641
00:27:33.971 --> 00:27:34.980
<v Speaker 2>prison is effective?</v>

642
00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:36.540
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not at all.</v>

643
00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:39.810
<v Speaker 2>It could be because here's the thing is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it destroys most people's lives.</v>

644
00:27:39.811 --> 00:27:42.540
<v Speaker 2>They can't get a job when they get out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their family's been broken up,</v>

645
00:27:42.541 --> 00:27:46.650
<v Speaker 2>their community's been broken up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like you get out and then how do</v>

646
00:27:46.651 --> 00:27:47.910
<v Speaker 2>you put things together?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it,</v>

647
00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:51.750
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't help people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't help them get to a regular,</v>

648
00:27:51.751 --> 00:27:53.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>upstanding citizen level.</v>

649
00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:55.650
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It institutionalizes.</v>

650
00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:56.543
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

651
00:27:57.620 --> 00:27:58.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

652
00:27:58.590 --> 00:28:00.570
<v Speaker 2>but here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the big question is like,</v>

653
00:28:00.571 --> 00:28:02.850
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what could be done that's better?</v>

654
00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:04.111
<v Speaker 2>What does that say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie?</v>

655
00:28:04.111 --> 00:28:05.550
<v Speaker 2>Would you putting up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

656
00:28:05.551 --> 00:28:07.200
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's a nonviolent,</v>

657
00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:08.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you shouldn't,</v>

658
00:28:08.910 --> 00:28:10.680
<v Speaker 2>you shouldn't be in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got that one,</v>

659
00:28:10.681 --> 00:28:12.060
<v Speaker 2>stick it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think it is?</v>

660
00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:15.150
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a different offenses.</v>

661
00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:16.130
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

662
00:28:16.130 --> 00:28:19.230
<v Speaker 2>is that drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drug charges on the giant.</v>

663
00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:21.300

<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

664
00:28:22.010 --> 00:28:23.750
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>

665
00:28:23.770 --> 00:28:25.680
<v Speaker 2>Six percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

666
00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:28.410
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at those numbers.</v>

667
00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:29.820
<v Speaker 2>The only.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only thing.</v>

668
00:28:29.850 --> 00:28:31.830
<v Speaker 2>Scroll down a little more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

669
00:28:31.831 --> 00:28:34.170
<v Speaker 2>The only thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even above 10 percent is drugs.</v>

670
00:28:34.171 --> 00:28:35.004
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And weapons.</v>

671
00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:38.070
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not stopping people from selling</v>

672
00:28:38.071 --> 00:28:39.270
<v Speaker 2>drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously.</v>

673
00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:43.770
<v Speaker 2>Plus there's a bunch of other drugs that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are available legally with</v>

674
00:28:43.771 --> 00:28:47.730
<v Speaker 2>prescriptions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need to stop this illegal drug</v>

675
00:28:47.731 --> 00:28:49.950
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need to stop telling grown adults</v>

676
00:28:49.951 --> 00:28:53.700
<v Speaker 2>what they can or can't do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Keep it away from children.</v>

677
00:28:53.850 --> 00:28:56.280
<v Speaker 2>Make strict laws about the age</v>
<v Speaker 2>restrictions.</v>

678
00:28:56.610 --> 00:29:01.140
<v Speaker 2>Put a lot of money into education and</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop putting people in cages for doing</v>

679
00:29:01.141 --> 00:29:02.770
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to do like coke,</v>

680
00:29:02.970 --> 00:29:05.790

<v Speaker 2>let them go do coke.</v>

681
00:29:05.791 --> 00:29:08.630
<v Speaker 2>What do you give a fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can go drink whiskey and die and</v>

682
00:29:08.650 --> 00:29:10.530
<v Speaker 2>everybody's fine with that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then people go,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Well then arrest them for the crimes.</v>

685
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.450
<v Speaker 2>You don't arrest them for the coke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alcohol is a huge factor in.</v>

686
00:29:18.451 --> 00:29:19.840
<v Speaker 2>In crimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>crimes because they'd been drunk?</v>

00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:51.000
<v Speaker 5>but if you can't handle it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>want to drink right now.</v>

700
00:29:51.630 --> 00:29:54.550
<v Speaker 5>Now I got to drive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Drive somewhere.</v>

701
00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:56.740
<v Speaker 5>I was little drinky poos.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just one little slip,</v>

702
00:29:56.741 --> 00:29:59.060
<v Speaker 5>but the good stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're going to little Daniel.</v>

703
00:30:02.290 --> 00:30:03.550
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

704
00:30:03.551 --> 00:30:06.310
<v Speaker 6>Booze is a sketchy drug because I enjoy</v>
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>

705
00:30:06.490 --> 00:30:08.440
<v Speaker 6>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But is it for everybody?</v>

706
00:30:08.650 --> 00:30:10.900
<v Speaker 6>It's like there's a lot of things like</v>
<v Speaker 6>that though.</v>

707
00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:13.720
<v Speaker 6>Try.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How about how come you can just go to a</v>

708
00:30:13.721 --> 00:30:17.590
<v Speaker 6>Chevrolet dealership and buy a corvette?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you know how to drive that thing?</v>

709
00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:20.320
<v Speaker 6>You know how to drive.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know you know how to hit your blinker.</v>

710
00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:23.770
<v Speaker 6>You don't have to handle a 600</v>
<v Speaker 6>horsepower fucking demon ride.</v>

711
00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:26.770
<v Speaker 6>You could just buy that these cars</v>
<v Speaker 6>today,</v>

712
00:30:26.771 --> 00:30:28.840
<v Speaker 6>because of the horsepower wars,</v>
<v Speaker 6>every year,</v>

713
00:30:28.841 --> 00:30:30.640
<v Speaker 6>they're ramping up their speed,</v>
<v Speaker 6>their ramping up,</v>

714
00:30:30.641 --> 00:30:32.920
<v Speaker 6>their handling,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the ramp it up to the breaking,</v>

715
00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:36.950
<v Speaker 6>like the distance between like zero to</v>
<v Speaker 6>60 breaking or $60,</v>

716
00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:40.290
<v Speaker 6>zero the day.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Those things are super cars now and any</v>

717
00:30:40.390 --> 00:30:43.530
<v Speaker 6>regular kid,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you have enough money to like what?</v>

718
00:30:43.810 --> 00:30:46.300
<v Speaker 6>What's the corvette like?</v>
<v Speaker 6>50,000 or $60,000.</v>

719
00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:48.550
<v Speaker 6>If you can,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can get that money together somehow</v>

720
00:30:48.551 --> 00:30:51.580
<v Speaker 6>and get that loan.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can have something that's insane,</v>

721
00:30:51.910 --> 00:30:54.460
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You could just drive right into people</v>

722
00:30:54.461 --> 00:30:57.700
<v Speaker 6>and kill people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like the responsibility having a big</v>

723
00:30:57.701 --> 00:31:00.130
<v Speaker 6>giant truck.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The responsibility of driving that</v>

724
00:31:00.131 --> 00:31:02.980
<v Speaker 6>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like all those things are dangerous</v>

725
00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:05.620
<v Speaker 6>and we allow people to do it</v>

726
00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:06.560
<v Speaker 5>and so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

727
00:31:06.561 --> 00:31:08.690
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we accept that there is a certain level</v>

728
00:31:08.691 --> 00:31:13.220
<v Speaker 5>of harm or death for things that we want</v>
<v Speaker 5>as freedoms and that should be.</v>

729
00:31:13.250 --> 00:31:16.010
<v Speaker 5>That should go through a lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It should go through with drugs.</v>

730
00:31:16.011 --> 00:31:18.980
<v Speaker 5>It's like there's a certain level of pl</v>
<v Speaker 5>harm or death people might do to</v>

731
00:31:18.981 --> 00:31:20.450
<v Speaker 5>themselves and they start doing it to</v>
<v Speaker 5>others.</v>

732
00:31:20.451 --> 00:31:21.320
<v Speaker 5>We arrest them for that.</v>

733
00:31:21.570 --> 00:31:23.490
<v Speaker 6>One of the things I was thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 6>when I brought up the,</v>

734
00:31:23.491 --> 00:31:24.510
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the car thing,</v>

735
00:31:24.511 --> 00:31:28.740
<v Speaker 6>so I wanted to ask you how you feel</v>
<v Speaker 6>about this oncoming onset of autonomous</v>

736
00:31:28.741 --> 00:31:30.490
<v Speaker 6>cars.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So that's happening now.</v>

737
00:31:30.850 --> 00:31:32.680
<v Speaker 5>So here I talked about this last night</v>
<v Speaker 5>in my,</v>

738
00:31:32.681 --> 00:31:36.320
<v Speaker 5>in my standup.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So Uber is now put self driving cars in</v>

739
00:31:36.321 --> 00:31:38.420
<v Speaker 5>Pittsburgh.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're trying it out and this is gonna.</v>

740
00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:42.450
<v Speaker 5>This is a massive employer in our</v>
<v Speaker 5>country is transportation.</v>

741
00:31:42.451 --> 00:31:44.480
<v Speaker 5>That's huge.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And those are going away.</v>

742
00:31:44.481 --> 00:31:48.710
<v Speaker 5>Those jobs are going to go away soon and</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that's fine because what that</v>

743
00:31:48.711 --> 00:31:51.830
<v Speaker 5>should do if we were fucking rational</v>
<v Speaker 5>beings,</v>

744
00:31:52.130 --> 00:31:55.640
<v Speaker 5>is that should though that time of that</v>
<v Speaker 5>time and money savings should go to</v>

745
00:31:55.641 --> 00:31:57.050
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it should go to all of us.</v>

746
00:31:57.170 --> 00:31:58.660
<v Speaker 5>We should all be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if we hate our job,</v>

747
00:31:58.661 --> 00:32:02.330
<v Speaker 5>which we work in less because the</v>
<v Speaker 5>technology can handle it now instead,</v>

748
00:32:02.331 --> 00:32:06.590
<v Speaker 5>everybody's just working that goddamn</v>
<v Speaker 5>asses off at jobs they hate because all</v>

749
00:32:06.591 --> 00:32:08.960
<v Speaker 5>of that time and savings is going to</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

750
00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:11.600
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the elites that run these corporations.</v>

751
00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:14.270
<v Speaker 5>It's not going to the people we are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We are.</v>

752
00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:17.300
<v Speaker 5>People are working themselves to death</v>
<v Speaker 5>to feed a family.</v>

753
00:32:17.450 --> 00:32:21.080
<v Speaker 5>It's completely nonsense,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but how does that have to do with the</v>

754
00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:22.580
<v Speaker 5>Uber thing though?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is it?</v>

755
00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:25.460
<v Speaker 5>Transportation is a major employment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is it?</v>

756
00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:29.990
<v Speaker 5>Isn't it like 40 something percent of</v>
<v Speaker 5>all white men over a certain age work in</v>

757
00:32:29.991 --> 00:32:31.880
<v Speaker 5>some sort of an industry where they</v>
<v Speaker 5>drive a vehicle?</v>

758
00:32:32.390 --> 00:32:35.800
<v Speaker 5>I'm not sure,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'm going up.</v>

759
00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:40.540
<v Speaker 5>I'll use values to say I'm a according</v>
<v Speaker 5>to Joe Rogan</v>

760
00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:41.450
<v Speaker 4>and people will go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

761
00:32:41.610 --> 00:32:43.190
<v Speaker 4>and they just raise their eyebrows.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

762
00:32:43.570 --> 00:32:45.530
<v Speaker 4>fear factor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Guys got opinions on driving,</v>

763
00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:47.990
<v Speaker 4>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think self driving cars should be</v>

764
00:32:47.991 --> 00:32:49.280
<v Speaker 4>great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're gonna get better and better and</v>

765
00:32:49.281 --> 00:32:52.580
<v Speaker 4>then the light bulb that when you say</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that,</v>

766
00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:57.640
<v Speaker 4>the money is going away because it's not</v>
<v Speaker 4>really right because someone has to make</v>

767
00:32:58.251 --> 00:33:00.230
<v Speaker 4>those cars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Someone has to maintain those cars.</v>

768
00:33:00.231 --> 00:33:04.010
<v Speaker 4>Someone has to run the uber software.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just the driver aspect of it is</v>

769
00:33:04.011 --> 00:33:06.240
<v Speaker 4>going away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The human labor part is going right,</v>

770
00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:08.480
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but all we're making all those cars to</v>

771
00:33:08.481 --> 00:33:13.481
<v Speaker 4>begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if it's way safer and people's lives</v>

772
00:33:13.941 --> 00:33:18.470
<v Speaker 4>are saved over people having jobs that</v>
<v Speaker 4>are not like a lot of fun anyway,</v>

773
00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:22.730
<v Speaker 4>like shouldn't that person like for</v>
<v Speaker 4>technological progress,</v>

774
00:33:22.731 --> 00:33:24.560
<v Speaker 4>when you look at the future of our</v>
<v Speaker 4>culture,</v>

775
00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:28.220
<v Speaker 4>as much as I love automobiles,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love them.</v>

776
00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:31.640
<v Speaker 4>I love engineering.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a giant fan of auto engineering,</v>

777
00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:35.060
<v Speaker 4>but they're going to go away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to have autonomous</v>

778
00:33:35.061 --> 00:33:36.770
<v Speaker 4>vehicles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's going to happen just like everybody</v>

779
00:33:36.771 --> 00:33:38.120
<v Speaker 4>has a cell phone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's almost,</v>

780
00:33:38.150 --> 00:33:40.340
<v Speaker 4>you can't find it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The hard thing is going to be getting a</v>

781
00:33:40.341 --> 00:33:45.070
<v Speaker 4>license to drive a car on your own</v>
<v Speaker 4>without any sort of that electronic to</v>

782
00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:46.340
<v Speaker 4>be sad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't even think of that.</v>

783
00:33:46.341 --> 00:33:47.380
<v Speaker 4>That's what's going to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

784
00:33:47.381 --> 00:33:49.400
<v Speaker 4>You gonna have to have a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if you have an old corvette or</v>

785
00:33:49.401 --> 00:33:51.080
<v Speaker 4>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to have to have a license</v>

786
00:33:51.081 --> 00:33:55.030
<v Speaker 4>to drive that old corvette with your</v>
<v Speaker 4>shitty has drum brakes and skillset</v>

787
00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:57.590
<v Speaker 4>fucked up tires.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And people like to think,</v>

788
00:33:57.650 --> 00:33:59.360
<v Speaker 4>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the autonomous thing won't happen</v>

789
00:33:59.361 --> 00:34:00.590
<v Speaker 4>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on a telesummit,</v>

790
00:34:00.790 --> 00:34:03.440
<v Speaker 4>autonomous car,</v>
<v Speaker 4>autonomous car will kill someone and</v>

791
00:34:03.441 --> 00:34:04.880
<v Speaker 4>then it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

792
00:34:04.881 --> 00:34:06.320
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they don't need to be better.</v>

793
00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:08.510
<v Speaker 4>They don't need to be the best ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just need to be better than humans.</v>

794
00:34:09.550 --> 00:34:10.750
<v Speaker 4>Humans quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

795
00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:12.590
<v Speaker 4>Like they're going to be instantly</v>
<v Speaker 4>better than humans.</v>

796
00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:15.140
<v Speaker 4>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with all those sensors that they could</v>

797
00:34:15.141 --> 00:34:17.350
<v Speaker 4>put on those things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you ever seen how they respond that</v>

798
00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:20.300
<v Speaker 4>they're really good at responding to</v>
<v Speaker 4>like cars swerving at them,</v>

799
00:34:20.301 --> 00:34:22.850
<v Speaker 4>they hit the brakes and if they're all</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing that,</v>

800
00:34:22.910 --> 00:34:26.090
<v Speaker 4>as long as the code is good and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>machinery is good and nothing gets</v>

801
00:34:26.091 --> 00:34:28.190
<v Speaker 4>fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's the big thing.</v>

802
00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:31.860
<v Speaker 4>If it gets fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>will it have enough checkpoints like to</v>

803
00:34:32.450 --> 00:34:35.060
<v Speaker 4>be able to do an assessment of itself</v>
<v Speaker 4>and know whether or not should be</v>

804
00:34:35.061 --> 00:34:36.120
<v Speaker 4>driving.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Although here's the,</v>

805
00:34:36.170 --> 00:34:38.990
<v Speaker 4>here's the big question is it'll take</v>
<v Speaker 4>it'll inch,</v>

806
00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:41.900
<v Speaker 4>it'll eventually get to a point where</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's taken away our freedom and a lot of</v>

807
00:34:41.901 --> 00:34:45.020
<v Speaker 4>ways because these things are going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>drive the speed limit and you're gonna.</v>

808
00:34:45.050 --> 00:34:47.390
<v Speaker 4>It's gonna drive a fucking nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>

809
00:34:48.290 --> 00:34:51.200
<v Speaker 4>You'd be sitting there and it's going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>become illegal to go above the speed</v>

810
00:34:51.201 --> 00:34:53.270
<v Speaker 4>limit because it's driving.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cars will go the speed limit.</v>

811
00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:56.900
<v Speaker 4>You're going to have to follow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The rules can be awful.</v>

812
00:34:57.300 --> 00:35:02.040
<v Speaker 4>We'll just have to find some Russian</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude who knows a guy with a chip hot rod</v>

813
00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:04.900
<v Speaker 4>out your shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got one of those second one of the</v>

814
00:35:05.090 --> 00:35:08.000
<v Speaker 4>bots that breaks the law,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the criminal butts.</v>

815
00:35:08.210 --> 00:35:11.510
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if if we're going to progress and go</v>

816
00:35:11.511 --> 00:35:14.900
<v Speaker 4>from here to some new state of</v>
<v Speaker 4>technological excellence,</v>

817
00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:17.990
<v Speaker 4>which undoubtedly will if we stay alive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

818
00:35:18.170 --> 00:35:21.860
<v Speaker 4>I mean every civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every culture in this country as far as</v>

819
00:35:21.861 --> 00:35:23.960
<v Speaker 4>we've been measuring,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just keeps getting better and better</v>

820
00:35:23.961 --> 00:35:26.000
<v Speaker 4>and better at figuring things out more</v>
<v Speaker 4>and more efficient.</v>

821
00:35:26.001 --> 00:35:29.410
<v Speaker 4>Although we're polluting more and</v>
<v Speaker 4>damaging the earth more than what our</v>

822
00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:32.450
<v Speaker 4>capabilities keep getting more and more</v>
<v Speaker 4>powerful.</v>

823
00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:34.700
<v Speaker 4>There's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's gonna come a point in time I</v>

824
00:35:34.701 --> 00:35:38.520
<v Speaker 4>think where it was inevitable that</v>
<v Speaker 4>people had stopped powering</v>

825
00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:41.370
<v Speaker 6>machines with their hands.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like we should probably get out of that</v>

826
00:35:41.371 --> 00:35:45.840
<v Speaker 6>as quick as we can and concentrating</v>
<v Speaker 6>using our brains like and like the idea</v>

827
00:35:45.841 --> 00:35:47.880
<v Speaker 6>that the person who drives the car could</v>
<v Speaker 6>only drive the car.</v>

828
00:35:47.970 --> 00:35:49.680
<v Speaker 6>That's kind of crazy because I used to</v>
<v Speaker 6>drive cars.</v>

829
00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:52.200
<v Speaker 6>Did you ever drive cars before?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I drove limos,</v>

830
00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:55.980
<v Speaker 6>so I just drive and deliver newspapers.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I've been in driving jobs.</v>

831
00:35:56.050 --> 00:35:58.810
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I can do other stuff like other can</v>

832
00:35:58.830 --> 00:36:00.290
<v Speaker 6>do other stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 6>People can do other stuff.</v>

833
00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:01.770
<v Speaker 6>You can find another thing that you'd</v>
<v Speaker 6>like to do.</v>

834
00:36:01.771 --> 00:36:05.990
<v Speaker 6>It's not like this guy lost his job.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The only way feeds his family.</v>

835
00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:09.090
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I feel terrible that you lost your job.</v>

836
00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:11.370
<v Speaker 6>I'll feel terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then anybody loses their job and they</v>

837
00:36:11.371 --> 00:36:15.930
<v Speaker 6>have a hard time feeding their family.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But when you're talking about a job,</v>

838
00:36:15.931 --> 00:36:20.370
<v Speaker 6>I know it's hard to get jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but people lose and gain jobs all the</v>

839
00:36:20.371 --> 00:36:21.780
<v Speaker 6>time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It does happen.</v>

840
00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:24.150
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I got to find one that's better than</v>

841
00:36:24.151 --> 00:36:24.660
<v Speaker 6>this one,</v>

842
00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:25.171
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I.</v>

843
00:36:25.171 --> 00:36:25.921
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I agree,</v>

844
00:36:25.921 --> 00:36:27.240
<v Speaker 7>but.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But for one thing,</v>

845
00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:31.660
<v Speaker 7>not everyone is smart enough to get a</v>
<v Speaker 7>headset and really intelligent jobs.</v>

846
00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:34.410
<v Speaker 7>There's a lot of families.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's a lot of dummy fix that will the</v>

847
00:36:34.411 --> 00:36:37.920
<v Speaker 7>Alex Jones Britt genius pills from the</v>
<v Speaker 7>CIA,</v>

848
00:36:37.930 --> 00:36:42.650
<v Speaker 7>basement.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Luther Vandross hold of these 1984 and</v>

849
00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:46.530
<v Speaker 7>there was a period of six months where</v>
<v Speaker 7>he didn't sing because they had him</v>

850
00:36:46.531 --> 00:36:50.940
<v Speaker 7>locked up in the basement.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The Dungeon and Virginia colloidal</v>

851
00:36:50.941 --> 00:36:54.720
<v Speaker 7>silver will fix you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You ever see that dude who drank too</v>

852
00:36:54.721 --> 00:36:55.554
<v Speaker 7>much?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Cool little silver?</v>

853
00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:57.750
<v Speaker 7>He turned blue.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh yeah,</v>

854
00:36:57.900 --> 00:37:01.110
<v Speaker 7>I did see the blue guy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He died when he died,</v>

855
00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:03.270
<v Speaker 7>but he was old.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He died.</v>

856
00:37:03.490 --> 00:37:05.880
<v Speaker 7>He didn't die from being below blue.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't think so.</v>

857
00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:07.420
<v Speaker 7>We might have.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't think.</v>

858
00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:09.210
<v Speaker 7>Maybe I'm wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think he just died.</v>

859
00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:10.830
<v Speaker 7>I'm waiting for one day for Alex Jones</v>
<v Speaker 7>and go,</v>

860
00:37:10.831 --> 00:37:12.860
<v Speaker 7>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I need to tell you.</v>

861
00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:15.780
<v Speaker 7>I don't have the papers,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't have the documents.</v>

862
00:37:15.781 --> 00:37:18.180
<v Speaker 7>I've been lying.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've been lying the whole time,</v>

863
00:37:18.210 --> 00:37:21.540
<v Speaker 7>but right here I don't have.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I lost the documents.</v>

864
00:37:21.541 --> 00:37:22.470
<v Speaker 7>I lost.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I had them.</v>

865
00:37:23.110 --> 00:37:25.890
<v Speaker 7>I spilled coffee on him,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but he had some documents.</v>

866
00:37:25.891 --> 00:37:26.970
<v Speaker 7>That's the fucking problem.</v>

867
00:37:27.130 --> 00:37:29.200
<v Speaker 6>Did you ever see he had a documentary</v>
<v Speaker 6>that one of them.</v>

868
00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:31.030
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Really opened my eyes.</v>

869
00:37:31.270 --> 00:37:34.790
<v Speaker 6>It was nine one,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one a road to tyranny and there's was</v>

870
00:37:34.791 --> 00:37:39.670
<v Speaker 6>another typical ouch Jones to touch on.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know it.</v>

871
00:37:39.671 --> 00:37:42.280
<v Speaker 6>He's talking about the demise of</v>
<v Speaker 6>civilization and all these different</v>

872
00:37:42.281 --> 00:37:45.940
<v Speaker 6>things,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but then he goes into the WTO,</v>

873
00:37:46.310 --> 00:37:49.840
<v Speaker 6>the WTO protests,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and this is where it got really crazy.</v>

874
00:37:49.841 --> 00:37:51.310
<v Speaker 6>Ninety nine.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

875
00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:56.020
<v Speaker 6>and he showed that all of these</v>
<v Speaker 6>anarchists came in.</v>

876
00:37:56.021 --> 00:37:59.950
<v Speaker 6>There's all these peaceful protesters</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then all these anarchists came in</v>

877
00:38:00.130 --> 00:38:05.130
<v Speaker 6>with ski masks on and government issued</v>
<v Speaker 6>boots and started smashing everything.</v>

878
00:38:05.561 --> 00:38:07.750
<v Speaker 6>They're literally wearing military issue</v>
<v Speaker 6>boots.</v>

879
00:38:07.930 --> 00:38:12.930
<v Speaker 6>They start knocking over newspaper</v>
<v Speaker 6>dispensers and smashing car windows and</v>

880
00:38:12.971 --> 00:38:16.150
<v Speaker 6>storefronts and stuff like that to move</v>
<v Speaker 6>in to.</v>

881
00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:19.480
<v Speaker 6>The cops have to move in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so then these guys get wrapped up into</v>

882
00:38:19.481 --> 00:38:21.160
<v Speaker 6>some building.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They get like quartered in some</v>

883
00:38:21.161 --> 00:38:23.290
<v Speaker 6>building.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They negotiate their release and then</v>

884
00:38:23.291 --> 00:38:24.430
<v Speaker 6>they're released without charges.</v>

885
00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:26.570
<v Speaker 7>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The provocateur thing that.</v>

886
00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:30.720
<v Speaker 7>That shit happens all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Where I mean at the end of occupy,</v>

887
00:38:30.721 --> 00:38:33.780
<v Speaker 7>it's like half of those camps were</v>
<v Speaker 7>infiltrated cops.</v>

888
00:38:33.781 --> 00:38:36.000
<v Speaker 7>Like we're just plain cops.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

889
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.770
<v Speaker 6>here's what they did with,</v>
<v Speaker 6>with Seattle.</v>

890
00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:39.700
<v Speaker 6>Was it Seattle?</v>
<v Speaker 6>The WTF?</v>

891
00:38:40.450 --> 00:38:44.140
<v Speaker 6>They made people take off.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They had badges.</v>

892
00:38:44.170 --> 00:38:46.420
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like if someone had like a pin that</v>

893
00:38:46.421 --> 00:38:48.610
<v Speaker 6>you're wearing that hat a WTO with a red</v>
<v Speaker 6>line through it.</v>

894
00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:53.410
<v Speaker 6>They said this is a no protest zone.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can't get through this zone with any</v>

895
00:38:53.411 --> 00:38:57.700
<v Speaker 6>form of protest.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So even a pin that says WTO with a red</v>

896
00:38:57.701 --> 00:38:59.350
<v Speaker 6>line through it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They were telling people,</v>

897
00:38:59.351 --> 00:39:01.300
<v Speaker 6>you can't get to your job with that.</v>

898
00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:03.020
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you gotta you gotta be in the freedom of</v>

899
00:39:03.021 --> 00:39:05.300
<v Speaker 5>speech zone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We've fenced off four feet.</v>

900
00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:07.070
<v Speaker 5>That's the freedom of speech zone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dude.</v>

901
00:39:07.071 --> 00:39:08.720
<v Speaker 5>That's what's happening in standing rock</v>
<v Speaker 5>right now.</v>

902
00:39:08.721 --> 00:39:10.630
<v Speaker 5>Have you talked about Sandra and.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I haven't.</v>

903
00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:13.190
<v Speaker 5>We have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We've talked about it very briefly</v>

904
00:39:13.191 --> 00:39:14.770
<v Speaker 5>because I've been trying to pay</v>
<v Speaker 5>attention to it.</v>

905
00:39:14.810 --> 00:39:17.640
<v Speaker 5>It's getting crazier from all sides.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

906
00:39:17.690 --> 00:39:18.490
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

907
00:39:18.490 --> 00:39:19.880
<v Speaker 5>this group,</v>
<v Speaker 5>standing rock,</v>

908
00:39:19.881 --> 00:39:22.520
<v Speaker 5>the standing rock Sioux.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't want an oil pipeline through</v>

909
00:39:22.521 --> 00:39:24.130
<v Speaker 5>the fucking water supply.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a,</v>

910
00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:27.230
<v Speaker 5>it should be the right and instead it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>this corporation,</v>

911
00:39:27.231 --> 00:39:30.890
<v Speaker 5>it's just plowing through their sacred</v>
<v Speaker 5>land and you know,</v>

912
00:39:30.891 --> 00:39:31.660
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the cops.</v>

913
00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:34.130
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a girl had her arm nearly blown off.</v>

914
00:39:34.131 --> 00:39:37.220
<v Speaker 5>They didn't quite have to amputate with</v>
<v Speaker 5>a concussion grenade by the cop.</v>

915
00:39:37.370 --> 00:39:40.370
<v Speaker 6>I heard that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then the conspiracy theory online</v>

916
00:39:40.371 --> 00:39:44.150
<v Speaker 6>was that it wasn't a concussion grenade</v>
<v Speaker 6>that it was something that they had</v>

917
00:39:44.151 --> 00:39:48.380
<v Speaker 6>launched and then it went bad because</v>
<v Speaker 6>there was more than one propane tank</v>

918
00:39:48.381 --> 00:39:51.230
<v Speaker 6>grenade or some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>See if you could find out,</v>

919
00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:52.760
<v Speaker 6>get to the bottom of it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Jamie.</v>

920
00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:54.200
<v Speaker 6>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

921
00:39:54.201 --> 00:39:57.050
<v Speaker 6>I saw them spraying water on the</v>
<v Speaker 6>protesters.</v>

922
00:39:57.051 --> 00:39:59.000
<v Speaker 6>It was like 40 degrees out there hosing</v>
<v Speaker 6>these people.</v>

923
00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:02.420
<v Speaker 5>It was 23 degrees though subfreezing</v>
<v Speaker 5>temperatures wasn't really.</v>

924
00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:05.360
<v Speaker 5>And they're hosing them in water and now</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is the best part.</v>

925
00:40:05.361 --> 00:40:08.840
<v Speaker 5>On top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the governor signed a mandatory eviction</v>

926
00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:11.180
<v Speaker 5>thing for,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for all of them saying it's because of</v>

927
00:40:11.181 --> 00:40:13.340
<v Speaker 5>cold temperatures and we're worried</v>
<v Speaker 5>about your safety.</v>

928
00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:15.140
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jesus Christ.</v>

929
00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:16.730
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wasn't real worried about,</v>

930
00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:18.800
<v Speaker 5>we're going to hit you with concussion</v>
<v Speaker 5>grenades because we're worried about</v>

931
00:40:18.801 --> 00:40:20.750
<v Speaker 5>your safety.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People are getting jacked by those</v>

932
00:40:20.751 --> 00:40:22.910
<v Speaker 5>rubber bullets to rubber bullets can</v>
<v Speaker 5>take an eye out.</v>

933
00:40:22.911 --> 00:40:24.350
<v Speaker 5>Folks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those things are no joke.</v>

934
00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:29.300
<v Speaker 5>I can hurt you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bad to know a girl who lost an eye to a,</v>

935
00:40:29.301 --> 00:40:31.490
<v Speaker 5>a face shot,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a tear gas canister that hit her,</v>

936
00:40:32.310 --> 00:40:33.010
<v Speaker 5>hit her in the eye.</v>

937
00:40:33.010 --> 00:40:34.120
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God.</v>

938
00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:35.810
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

939
00:40:35.810 --> 00:40:37.910
<v Speaker 5>These,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these less than lethal rounds can</v>

940
00:40:37.911 --> 00:40:38.744
<v Speaker 5>fucking do some damage.</v>

941
00:40:38.770 --> 00:40:39.640
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He can't.</v>

942
00:40:39.730 --> 00:40:40.680
<v Speaker 6>He can't just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's,</v>

943
00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:43.270
<v Speaker 6>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's like really weak assault.</v>

944
00:40:43.271 --> 00:40:46.390
<v Speaker 6>That's like going up to someone.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You say you didn't start a fight,</v>

945
00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:48.580
<v Speaker 6>but you start spitting out him and</v>
<v Speaker 6>slapping him.</v>

946
00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:50.710
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like you're not trying to kill them,</v>

947
00:40:51.130 --> 00:40:52.720
<v Speaker 6>but you definitely hurting them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

949
00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:55.410
<v Speaker 5>nick?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Going after reporters.</v>

950
00:40:55.411 --> 00:40:57.060
<v Speaker 5>This girl,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Erin Schrode,</v>

<v Speaker 5>she's been on ABC as a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as a commentator and stuff.</v>

952
00:40:59.730 --> 00:41:01.740
<v Speaker 5>She was down there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's video of her,</v>

953
00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:05.430
<v Speaker 5>a viral video of her where she's</v>
<v Speaker 5>interviewing a guy as she's</v>

954
00:41:05.431 --> 00:41:08.550
<v Speaker 5>interviewing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she gets shot by a sniper with a rubber</v>

955
00:41:08.551 --> 00:41:11.170
<v Speaker 5>bullet for doing nothing for just</v>
<v Speaker 5>interviewing her.</v>

956
00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:12.620
<v Speaker 6>I've seen that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Yeah man.</v>

961
00:41:24.591 --> 00:41:29.180
<v Speaker 6>It's and it also creates this us versus</v>
<v Speaker 6>them environment where these guys who</v>

962
00:41:29.181 --> 00:41:34.181
<v Speaker 6>are hired to be the cops that get rid of</v>
<v Speaker 6>the protesters are just regular people</v>

963
00:41:35.070 --> 00:41:38.110
<v Speaker 6>and they've been given orders to get rid</v>
<v Speaker 6>of these protestors and in the protest</v>

964
00:41:38.111 --> 00:41:41.360
<v Speaker 6>has become the enemy and then it becomes</v>
<v Speaker 6>an US versus them scenario,</v>

965
00:41:41.361 --> 00:41:42.950
<v Speaker 6>which we're so accustomed to</v>

966
00:41:43.410 --> 00:41:44.650
<v Speaker 5>and a lot of them are coming.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You are.</v>

967
00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:47.400
<v Speaker 5>They coming back from Iraq and</v>
<v Speaker 5>Afghanistan and they're used to war</v>

968
00:41:47.401 --> 00:41:51.410
<v Speaker 5>zones and they shouldn't be a war zone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This a peaceful protest twos,</v>

969
00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:52.100
<v Speaker 5>which it is.</v>

970
00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:53.360
<v Speaker 6>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

971
00:41:53.361 --> 00:41:56.180
<v Speaker 6>I don't know what the answer is to</v>
<v Speaker 6>something like that.</v>

972
00:41:56.181 --> 00:42:00.440
<v Speaker 6>I don't know how you stop what's already</v>
<v Speaker 6>been done and I don't know how he ever</v>

973
00:42:00.441 --> 00:42:05.210
<v Speaker 6>got permission to go through somebody's</v>
<v Speaker 6>land if the land is public.</v>

974
00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:06.800
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's one thing.</v>

975
00:42:06.830 --> 00:42:09.560
<v Speaker 6>If you want to have a debate on whether</v>
<v Speaker 6>or not we can do what we can do with our</v>

976
00:42:09.561 --> 00:42:11.730
<v Speaker 6>own national public lands.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm,</v>

977
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:12.320
<v Speaker 6>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

978
00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:14.480
<v Speaker 6>I'm against that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm against.</v>

979
00:42:14.481 --> 00:42:17.120
<v Speaker 6>I'm against.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think we fucked up so much of this</v>

980
00:42:17.121 --> 00:42:19.190
<v Speaker 6>country as it is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Let's stop.</v>

981
00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:22.850
<v Speaker 6>Let's not do anymore of that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But if that's private land,</v>

982
00:42:22.970 --> 00:42:24.980
<v Speaker 6>if it's privately with they own the</v>
<v Speaker 6>land.</v>

983
00:42:25.010 --> 00:42:26.350
<v Speaker 6>Do they have a treaty land?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

984
00:42:26.351 --> 00:42:28.160
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a rancher on the land to right?</v>

985
00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:28.790
<v Speaker 6>If they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

986
00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:29.150
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

987
00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:30.990
<v Speaker 6>The rancher who are ranchers lands.</v>

988
00:42:31.210 --> 00:42:33.270
<v Speaker 5>There's another woman in Iowa St</v>
<v Speaker 5>pipeline though.</v>

989
00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:35.590
<v Speaker 5>Dakota access.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cindy Coppola.</v>

990
00:42:35.950 --> 00:42:37.660
<v Speaker 5>She's a farmer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She,</v>

991
00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:40.600
<v Speaker 5>she's not native Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's a white woman farmer in Iowa.</v>

992
00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:43.840
<v Speaker 5>They're coming through her own farm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They arrested her for getting in their</v>

993
00:42:43.841 --> 00:42:44.180
<v Speaker 5>way.</v>

994
00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:45.740
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They said that they had to have access.</v>

995
00:42:45.770 --> 00:42:47.180
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so they made some sort of an</v>

996
00:42:47.181 --> 00:42:48.014
<v Speaker 6>easement,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

997
00:42:48.330 --> 00:42:48.961
<v Speaker 5>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

998
00:42:48.961 --> 00:42:50.120
<v Speaker 5>they just started.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just,</v>

999
00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:52.960
<v Speaker 5>they go into the city council and they</v>
<v Speaker 5>get something passed and the eminent</v>

1000
00:42:53.610 --> 00:42:55.290
<v Speaker 5>domain and they just take the land.</v>

1001
00:42:55.350 --> 00:42:56.580
<v Speaker 6>See,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's what the problem is,</v>

1002
00:42:56.581 --> 00:42:57.990
<v Speaker 6>folks.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is a company,</v>

1003
00:42:58.260 --> 00:43:03.260
<v Speaker 6>this is not the United States government</v>
<v Speaker 6>safety commission that needs this oil to</v>

1004
00:43:04.411 --> 00:43:08.430
<v Speaker 6>protect us from impending invaders.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's nothing like in your best</v>

1005
00:43:08.431 --> 00:43:11.360
<v Speaker 6>interest about this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is all money that they're not going</v>

1006
00:43:11.361 --> 00:43:13.080
<v Speaker 6>to give you free oil because they got</v>
<v Speaker 6>that oil.</v>

1007
00:43:13.350 --> 00:43:15.510
<v Speaker 5>Most of it shipped overseas don't even</v>
<v Speaker 5>go to us.</v>

1008
00:43:15.610 --> 00:43:17.400
<v Speaker 5>It's billions of dollars in profit.</v>

1009
00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:20.880
<v Speaker 6>That's the darkness of this is that</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're going through land that's not</v>

1010
00:43:20.881 --> 00:43:23.160
<v Speaker 6>theirs and they think they just can</v>
<v Speaker 6>because they want oil.</v>

1011
00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:25.590
<v Speaker 6>Like I've seen people argue that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1012
00:43:25.591 --> 00:43:27.480
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is exaggerated or that's</v>

1013
00:43:27.481 --> 00:43:30.020
<v Speaker 6>exaggerated,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but here's the cold faculty can't</v>

1014
00:43:30.030 --> 00:43:32.310
<v Speaker 6>ignore.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're going through somebody else's</v>

1015
00:43:32.311 --> 00:43:36.090
<v Speaker 6>land against their will.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So either it's their land or it's not</v>

1016
00:43:36.091 --> 00:43:37.890
<v Speaker 6>their land.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's their land.</v>

1017
00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:39.660
<v Speaker 6>Did you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>do they have a treaty?</v>

1018
00:43:39.661 --> 00:43:41.010
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Does this guy have a ranch?</v>

1019
00:43:41.011 --> 00:43:41.791
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Does he own it?</v>

1020
00:43:41.791 --> 00:43:43.020
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Stop.</v>

1021
00:43:44.410 --> 00:43:45.420
<v Speaker 6>You're the government,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1022
00:43:45.421 --> 00:43:46.740
<v Speaker 6>You know what that means?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Your people.</v>

1023
00:43:46.770 --> 00:43:51.120
<v Speaker 6>People can't go through other people's</v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking ground because they think they</v>

1024
00:43:51.121 --> 00:43:53.130
<v Speaker 6>want to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can't just do that.</v>

1025
00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:53.491
<v Speaker 5>The,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1026
00:43:53.491 --> 00:43:54.031
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1027
00:43:54.031 --> 00:43:56.730
<v Speaker 5>the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The hypothetical idea is that we elected</v>

1028
00:43:56.731 --> 00:44:00.870
<v Speaker 5>these people to do our bidding,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not to do the corporations bidding.</v>

1029
00:44:00.871 --> 00:44:02.730
<v Speaker 5>Whatever the fuck they want to make</v>
<v Speaker 5>profit.</v>

1030
00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:04.750
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Whether you left wing or right wing,</v>

1031
00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:08.050
<v Speaker 6>that's the most insane proposition is</v>
<v Speaker 6>giving the government that kind of power</v>

1032
00:44:08.051 --> 00:44:13.051
<v Speaker 6>to just go through private land and and</v>
<v Speaker 6>pumping oil pipeline under a fucking</v>

1033
00:44:13.241 --> 00:44:14.360
<v Speaker 6>river and that's where what</v>

1034
00:44:14.490 --> 00:44:16.650
<v Speaker 5>and that's where mostly the left and</v>
<v Speaker 5>right come together.</v>

1035
00:44:16.651 --> 00:44:18.930
<v Speaker 5>It's like Libertarians,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the left and nobody.</v>

1036
00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:20.940
<v Speaker 5>Nobody wants to just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh yeah,</v>

1037
00:44:20.941 --> 00:44:23.340
<v Speaker 5>you can just plow through someone's land</v>
<v Speaker 5>where they want it or not.</v>

1038
00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:26.970
<v Speaker 6>And it's convenient for people to poopoo</v>
<v Speaker 6>because it's not your land.</v>

1039
00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:29.100
<v Speaker 6>But if it was your land,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what if you had this bitch and stream in</v>

1040
00:44:29.101 --> 00:44:31.530
<v Speaker 6>your backyard?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And he used to like catch in it and</v>

1041
00:44:31.531 --> 00:44:32.460
<v Speaker 6>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>God dammit baby.</v>

1042
00:44:32.461 --> 00:44:35.610
<v Speaker 6>We found the perfect spot to build a</v>
<v Speaker 6>house and you set up and everything's</v>

<v Speaker 6>enforcement.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A Morton County sheriff's department</v>

1073
00:45:57.271 --> 00:45:59.520
<v Speaker 6>2016,</v>
<v Speaker 6>saying the injury was caused by an</v>

1074
00:45:59.521 --> 00:46:02.850
<v Speaker 6>exploding propane canister that</v>
<v Speaker 6>protesters were handling.</v>

1075
00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:07.500
<v Speaker 6>They later removed the post,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but Wayne Wilansky Willinsky Lansky told</v>

1076
00:46:07.501 --> 00:46:12.210
<v Speaker 6>us the statement is false if he had no</v>
<v Speaker 6>burns on her and while making a major</v>

1077
00:46:12.211 --> 00:46:14.610
<v Speaker 6>portion,</v>
<v Speaker 6>while major portion of her lower arm was</v>

<v Speaker 6>blown out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God,</v>

1079
00:46:16.020 --> 00:46:19.380
<v Speaker 6>her hand was still attached by the own.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The bone making a claim that she was a</v>

1080
00:46:19.381 --> 00:46:21.870
<v Speaker 6>victim of a fire explosion seem</v>
<v Speaker 6>unlikely.</v>

1081
00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:25.830
<v Speaker 6>He said she was totally lucid after</v>
<v Speaker 6>being injured and recounted being struck</v>

1082
00:46:25.831 --> 00:46:29.310
<v Speaker 6>by a grenade like object and exploded on</v>
<v Speaker 6>contact with her arm.</v>

1083
00:46:29.410 --> 00:46:31.130
<v Speaker 6>So it's a flash grenade.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a flash grenade.</v>

<v Speaker 6>creates fake news stories and they asked</v>
<v Speaker 6>him why he did it.</v>

<v Speaker 6>And it's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was not dig the other day.</v>

<v Speaker 6>who they interviewed and they said that</v>

1104

1114
00:47:54.431 --> 00:47:57.870
<v Speaker 7>It was fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was really like a lot of protests</v>

1115
00:47:57.910 --> 00:47:59.480
<v Speaker 7>right after trump won.</v>

1118
00:48:04.811 --> 00:48:06.820
<v Speaker 7>Like to see the streets filled with</v>
<v Speaker 7>people.</v>

1119
00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:07.930
<v Speaker 7>I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 7>they close down streets.</v>

<v Speaker 7>hundreds of thousands of people.</v>

1122
00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:19.330
<v Speaker 7>Millions just walking down the street</v>
<v Speaker 7>screaming out slogans.</v>

1123
00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:21.190
<v Speaker 7>I made my.</v>
<v Speaker 7>My point is yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 7>They should be furious,</v>

1125
00:48:23.141 --> 00:48:25.510
<v Speaker 7>but they should have been furious five</v>
<v Speaker 7>years ago.</v>

1126
00:48:25.510 --> 00:48:27.580
<v Speaker 7>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>why wait until this?</v>

1127
00:48:27.610 --> 00:48:28.630
<v Speaker 7>Because we have bills,</v>
<v Speaker 7>bro.</v>

1128
00:48:30.010 --> 00:48:32.800
<v Speaker 7>Shit to think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Got Problems.</v>

1130
00:48:36.731 --> 00:48:38.190
<v Speaker 7>Westworld is good.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was good.</v>

1131
00:48:38.350 --> 00:48:41.200
<v Speaker 7>My kids keep flunking school.</v>
<v Speaker 7>People have all sorts of things,</v>

<v Speaker 7>They got shit to do with them.</v>

1133
00:48:43.340 --> 00:48:46.900
<v Speaker 7>They got shit to do.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's why I think just even the idea of</v>

1134
00:48:46.901 --> 00:48:49.150
<v Speaker 7>a person being president is fucking</v>
<v Speaker 7>ridiculous.</v>

1135
00:48:49.510 --> 00:48:51.010
<v Speaker 7>Like how's this guy gonna run the way he</v>
<v Speaker 7>does.</v>

1136
00:48:51.011 --> 00:48:52.990
<v Speaker 7>He have a life.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He has an actual life.</v>

1137
00:48:52.991 --> 00:48:55.210
<v Speaker 7>He has family does.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It doesn't even play golf.</v>

1138
00:48:55.420 --> 00:48:57.760
<v Speaker 7>Doesn't have like things you like to do.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Does he read?</v>

1139
00:48:57.860 --> 00:49:00.130
<v Speaker 7>How the fuck is this guy?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Good time to do all that stuff.</v>

1140
00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:02.590
<v Speaker 7>Hey Bush.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Had time to take more vacation days than</v>

1141
00:49:02.591 --> 00:49:03.970
<v Speaker 7>anyone had ever.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Probably a good move.</v>

1142
00:49:04.130 --> 00:49:07.610
<v Speaker 7>It's really good.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean we all knew that Dick Cheney,</v>

1143
00:49:07.611 --> 00:49:10.830
<v Speaker 7>who was running the show anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I know we think we think we know we've</v>

1144
00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:14.140
<v Speaker 7>given increasing power to the president</v>
<v Speaker 7>when the president was supposed to be</v>

1145
00:49:14.141 --> 00:49:18.520
<v Speaker 7>one of three factors going on and now we</v>
<v Speaker 7>just keep feeding more and more power to</v>

1146
00:49:18.521 --> 00:49:21.430
<v Speaker 7>the president and that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>People that like Obama,</v>

1147
00:49:21.431 --> 00:49:26.431
<v Speaker 7>it's like he did not give away any power</v>
<v Speaker 7>that no president gives away any power</v>

1148
00:49:27.131 --> 00:49:29.080
<v Speaker 7>they've gotten.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So they just keep gaining and gaining</v>

1149
00:49:29.081 --> 00:49:30.360
<v Speaker 7>power.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1150
00:49:30.430 --> 00:49:35.430
<v Speaker 7>Well that was the big question.</v>
<v Speaker 7>When the NDA was proposed it they said,</v>

1151
00:49:36.101 --> 00:49:39.130
<v Speaker 7>what happens if Obama was very</v>
<v Speaker 7>reasonable guy?</v>

1152
00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:41.650
<v Speaker 7>Most likely he won't use indefinite</v>
<v Speaker 7>detention.</v>

1153
00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:44.300
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>But what if you get some new president?</v>

1154
00:49:44.320 --> 00:49:46.230
<v Speaker 7>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then liquid happened.</v>

1155
00:49:48.580 --> 00:49:49.120
<v Speaker 7>Here,</v>
<v Speaker 7>let me,</v>

1156
00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:52.720
<v Speaker 7>let me give you a dictator's toolkit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The largest surveillance infrastructure</v>

<v Speaker 7>Let me give you a the right to lock up</v>

1158

<v Speaker 7>Let me give you the right to drone bomb.</v>

1159
00:49:58.061 --> 00:50:03.061
<v Speaker 7>Americans and American was.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was a executed in drone bombings.</v>

1160
00:50:03.570 --> 00:50:07.870
<v Speaker 7>And as long as it's not an over here,</v>
<v Speaker 7>as long as it's not in our patch of</v>

<v Speaker 7>dirt,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we're cool with you killing Americans.</v>

1162
00:50:09.810 --> 00:50:12.960
<v Speaker 7>Flying Robots.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No trial,</v>

1163
00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:14.920
<v Speaker 7>no trial.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What was he,</v>

1164
00:50:14.980 --> 00:50:16.960
<v Speaker 7>what was he in?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Al Qaeda guy was the isis.</v>

1165
00:50:16.990 --> 00:50:20.230
<v Speaker 7>He joined isis or something.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And here's the thing is,</v>

1166
00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:22.180
<v Speaker 7>and I don't want to say the names</v>
<v Speaker 7>because I'll get them wrong,</v>

1167
00:50:22.181 --> 00:50:22.931
<v Speaker 7>but,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but his,</v>

1168
00:50:22.931 --> 00:50:25.450
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>his father was preaching terrorism,</v>

1169
00:50:25.451 --> 00:50:27.980
<v Speaker 7>so they executed him and then executed</v>
<v Speaker 7>16 year old son.</v>

1170
00:50:28.250 --> 00:50:30.350
<v Speaker 2>Nowhere near him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just took out the sun.</v>

1171
00:50:30.470 --> 00:50:32.570
<v Speaker 2>They just decided the sun was too risky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are like,</v>

1172
00:50:32.571 --> 00:50:33.404
<v Speaker 2>AH,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why not?</v>

1173
00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:35.010
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's some game of thrones shit,</v>

1174
00:50:35.870 --> 00:50:37.790
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is right.</v>

1175
00:50:37.820 --> 00:50:40.570
<v Speaker 2>That's some game of thrones type shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to kill the sign.</v>

1176
00:50:40.571 --> 00:50:43.340
<v Speaker 2>And literally when they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they were finally answered as to</v>

1177
00:50:43.341 --> 00:50:45.700
<v Speaker 2>why they had executed the sun go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of them,</v>

1178
00:50:45.870 --> 00:50:47.240
<v Speaker 2>one of the press secretary's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone goes,</v>

1179
00:50:47.450 --> 00:50:48.111
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1180
00:50:48.111 --> 00:50:49.580
<v Speaker 2>he shouldn't have had a father like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1181
00:50:52.340 --> 00:50:54.770
<v Speaker 2>Can you imagine if everyone were</v>
<v Speaker 2>responsible for what their father did?</v>

1182
00:50:55.210 --> 00:50:59.000
<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine if every father was responsible</v>

1183
00:50:59.001 --> 00:51:00.440
<v Speaker 2>for their kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did exactly.</v>

1184
00:51:00.441 --> 00:51:03.020
<v Speaker 2>My argument has always been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how come if your dog bites someone,</v>

1185
00:51:03.021 --> 00:51:06.050
<v Speaker 2>you can get sued.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If your kid shoots up a post office,</v>

1186
00:51:07.850 --> 00:51:10.130
<v Speaker 2>you're not liable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1187
00:51:10.540 --> 00:51:14.120
<v Speaker 2>like up to a certain age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should be liable for your kids like</v>

1188
00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:15.980
<v Speaker 2>23.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you want to go that far?</v>

1189
00:51:16.390 --> 00:51:17.260
<v Speaker 2>Twenty three?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1190
00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:17.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1191
00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:19.580
<v Speaker 2>You'll really work hard at doing a good</v>
<v Speaker 2>job.</v>

1192
00:51:20.180 --> 00:51:22.670
<v Speaker 2>Make sure you don't unleash that little</v>
<v Speaker 2>monster in the world.</v>

1193
00:51:22.671 --> 00:51:24.080
<v Speaker 2>So we have to deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>

1194
00:51:24.081 --> 00:51:27.640
<v Speaker 2>you dropped him 12 times and fed him Mac</v>
<v Speaker 2>and cheese all his life.</v>

1195
00:51:27.980 --> 00:51:30.680
<v Speaker 2>So what you have done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he fucked him now,</v>

1196
00:51:30.681 --> 00:51:32.510
<v Speaker 2>I mean how many people were out there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking their kids.</v>

1197
00:51:32.660 --> 00:51:36.870
<v Speaker 2>It happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of monsters out there.</v>

1198
00:51:36.871 --> 00:51:39.920
<v Speaker 2>People need hotter pets and then they'd</v>
<v Speaker 2>leave the kids alone and hotter.</v>

1199
00:51:39.921 --> 00:51:41.000
<v Speaker 2>Pets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kidding.</v>

1200
00:51:43.130 --> 00:51:45.200
<v Speaker 2>These reality joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck?</v>

1201
00:51:46.430 --> 00:51:48.530
<v Speaker 2>I've gone off the rail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was going to say something.</v>

1202
00:51:48.531 --> 00:51:51.860
<v Speaker 2>I totally derailed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That will fry your brain right there.</v>

1203
00:51:52.130 --> 00:51:53.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not that.</v>

1204
00:51:53.391 --> 00:51:55.490
<v Speaker 2>I really think that people should be</v>
<v Speaker 2>responsible for the kids.</v>

1205
00:51:55.590 --> 00:51:58.370
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's odd what we are and aren't</v>

1206
00:51:58.371 --> 00:52:01.970
<v Speaker 2>responsible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just amazing how easy it is to just</v>

1207
00:52:02.060 --> 00:52:04.550
<v Speaker 2>have a kid and they just do a shitty job</v>
<v Speaker 2>raising it.</v>

1208
00:52:04.551 --> 00:52:09.470
<v Speaker 2>Like you don't have a license to pump</v>
<v Speaker 2>out these fleshy idiots into the world.</v>

1209
00:52:09.580 --> 00:52:12.260
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not that you want to stop anybody</v>

1210
00:52:12.261 --> 00:52:13.730
<v Speaker 2>from doing it because who are you to</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell?</v>

1211
00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:16.910
<v Speaker 2>I mean somebody might want to tell you</v>
<v Speaker 2>that lead camp and all this bullshit</v>

1212
00:52:16.911 --> 00:52:19.040
<v Speaker 2>about the elite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think that fucking asshole should</v>

1213
00:52:19.041 --> 00:52:19.880
<v Speaker 2>have a kid?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1214
00:52:19.881 --> 00:52:21.790
<v Speaker 2>He's going to have the kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That little lefty fucking</v>

1215
00:52:23.910 --> 00:52:26.090
<v Speaker 2>argue about some shit that I know is</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>

1216
00:52:27.410 --> 00:52:29.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're going to decide that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't have a kid.</v>

1217
00:52:29.110 --> 00:52:30.190
<v Speaker 2>So who the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1218
00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:33.290
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of people wait fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>smarter than me and it became an</v>

1219
00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:36.290
<v Speaker 2>argument between who gets to breed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me or them they're going to win,</v>

1220
00:52:36.380 --> 00:52:38.570
<v Speaker 2>but I like having kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what the fuck?</v>

1221
00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:40.850
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many kids?</v>

1222
00:52:41.090 --> 00:52:43.230
<v Speaker 2>I have three.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to think about it for a second.</v>

1223
00:52:43.231 --> 00:52:45.740
<v Speaker 2>I thought you said I like having kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought we were going to hear like</v>

1224
00:52:45.741 --> 00:52:47.420
<v Speaker 2>seven or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I think about it because we were</v>

1225
00:52:47.421 --> 00:52:49.100
<v Speaker 2>talking to John Jones yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got four.</v>

1226
00:52:49.340 --> 00:52:50.270
<v Speaker 2>I left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1227
00:52:50.271 --> 00:52:51.550
<v Speaker 2>God damn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got four kids already.</v>

1228
00:52:51.560 --> 00:52:55.490
<v Speaker 2>He's trying for a boy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But my point being,</v>

1229
00:52:55.750 --> 00:53:00.750
<v Speaker 2>it's an uber complicated experience to</v>
<v Speaker 2>just hand off to everybody and the</v>

1230
00:53:01.700 --> 00:53:06.700
<v Speaker 2>outcome is a developed human being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're counting on everybody to do a</v>

1231
00:53:07.371 --> 00:53:11.090
<v Speaker 2>good job developing us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It lists at the beginning of idiocracy</v>

1232
00:53:11.091 --> 00:53:12.560
<v Speaker 2>is the truest thing that's ever been</v>
<v Speaker 2>created.</v>

1233
00:53:12.561 --> 00:53:14.160
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember that movie?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never saw it.</v>

1234
00:53:14.630 --> 00:53:15.950
<v Speaker 2>Never saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a bit.</v>

1235
00:53:16.010 --> 00:53:18.650
<v Speaker 2>Apparently that's extremely similar to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the premise of it.</v>

1236
00:53:18.710 --> 00:53:20.840
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really came out before the movie on</v>

1237
00:53:20.841 --> 00:53:21.860
<v Speaker 2>showtime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Luckily.</v>

1238
00:53:21.890 --> 00:53:25.980
<v Speaker 2>So it's documented and that movie was so</v>
<v Speaker 2>in</v>

1239
00:53:26.150 --> 00:53:28.740
<v Speaker 5>the fucking knew what was gonna happen</v>
<v Speaker 5>at the very,</v>

1240
00:53:29.030 --> 00:53:31.410
<v Speaker 5>very beginning of the movie is just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just too.</v>

1241
00:53:31.470 --> 00:53:35.520
<v Speaker 5>They just show a split screen of a</v>
<v Speaker 5>really dumb idiot couple,</v>

1242
00:53:35.580 --> 00:53:36.040
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1243
00:53:36.040 --> 00:53:37.480
<v Speaker 5>maybe rednecks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but just like,</v>

1244
00:53:37.510 --> 00:53:39.030
<v Speaker 5>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're fucking morons.</v>

1245
00:53:39.031 --> 00:53:41.430
<v Speaker 5>They clearly don't know what the fuck's</v>
<v Speaker 5>going on and they're just pumping out</v>

1246
00:53:41.431 --> 00:53:44.640
<v Speaker 5>kids.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just fucking dust into kids and</v>

1247
00:53:44.641 --> 00:53:45.760
<v Speaker 5>then they answer these,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1248
00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:51.140
<v Speaker 5>little liberal elite couple living in a</v>
<v Speaker 5>brownstone in New York deciding whether</v>

1249
00:53:51.361 --> 00:53:53.880
<v Speaker 5>to have a child.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And each year goes by and they're like,</v>

1250
00:53:53.890 --> 00:53:55.520
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we decided not yet.</v>

1251
00:53:55.550 --> 00:53:58.050
<v Speaker 5>We will do it soon and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they never have the kid,</v>

1252
00:53:58.590 --> 00:54:02.370
<v Speaker 5>meanwhile the rednecks and pumped out 42</v>
<v Speaker 5>kids and it's like,</v>

1253
00:54:02.371 --> 00:54:03.300
<v Speaker 5>well that's your world.</v>

1254
00:54:03.310 --> 00:54:05.770
<v Speaker 4>That is what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People that are career oriented,</v>

1255
00:54:05.771 --> 00:54:07.380
<v Speaker 4>especially if the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1256
00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:10.540
<v Speaker 4>the husband and the wife can't decide</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's going to stay home with the kid if</v>

1257
00:54:10.541 --> 00:54:12.190
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're both career oriented.</v>

1258
00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:13.960
<v Speaker 4>It becomes a thing like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

1259
00:54:13.961 --> 00:54:15.580
<v Speaker 4>let's wait until we're 36.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

1260
00:54:15.581 --> 00:54:16.960
<v Speaker 4>let's wait until we're 42.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

1261
00:54:16.961 --> 00:54:18.130
<v Speaker 4>let's freeze my eggs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1262
00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:18.700
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's,</v>

1263
00:54:18.700 --> 00:54:20.500
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then next thing you know,</v>

1264
00:54:20.501 --> 00:54:23.060
<v Speaker 4>you adopt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you should be allowed to freeze</v>

1265
00:54:23.120 --> 00:54:24.040
<v Speaker 4>a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At least,</v>

1266
00:54:24.041 --> 00:54:25.070
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>up to five.</v>

1267
00:54:26.350 --> 00:54:30.040
<v Speaker 4>Adopting you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is a great idea and it's,</v>

1268
00:54:30.250 --> 00:54:33.160
<v Speaker 4>it's awesome that a lot of people do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but people want their own kids.</v>

1269
00:54:33.210 --> 00:54:34.780
<v Speaker 4>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the other weird thing about it,</v>

1270
00:54:34.810 --> 00:54:38.230
<v Speaker 4>about DNA is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want your own DNA DNA pumped into my</v>

1271
00:54:38.231 --> 00:54:40.270
<v Speaker 4>boy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's my boy John.</v>

1272
00:54:40.340 --> 00:54:45.340
<v Speaker 4>You came right out of my own body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll teach you the way,</v>

1273
00:54:46.210 --> 00:54:48.310
<v Speaker 4>the way of the Mayan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1274
00:54:48.311 --> 00:54:49.120
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1275
00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:51.400
<v Speaker 4>it's a very odd thing that we do it so</v>
<v Speaker 4>often though,</v>

1276
00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:53.140
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like even me,</v>

1277

<v Speaker 4>I told you I've got three of them,</v>

1278
00:54:54.820 --> 00:54:56.890
<v Speaker 4>but I look around,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's 7 billion people on this planet.</v>

1279
00:54:56.891 --> 00:54:57.311
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

<v Speaker 5>out numbered.</v>

1288
00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:19.940
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Way Out numbered here.</v>

1289
00:55:19.980 --> 00:55:21.350
<v Speaker 5>The world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1290
00:55:21.470 --> 00:55:22.303
<v Speaker 5>India.</v>

1291
00:55:22.310 --> 00:55:24.350
<v Speaker 4>Well that's a cool thing about America</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you fly over,</v>

1292
00:55:24.351 --> 00:55:27.200
<v Speaker 4>like if the shit gets really bad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have so many places to expand.</v>

1293
00:55:27.790 --> 00:55:30.410
<v Speaker 4>We have so many new subdivisions we</v>
<v Speaker 4>could open up in the middle of nowhere.</v>

1294
00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:33.200
<v Speaker 4>Like when you're flying over and you see</v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing but like empty space,</v>

1295
00:55:33.201 --> 00:55:33.591
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1296
00:55:33.591 --> 00:55:35.690
<v Speaker 4>we could fucking live here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1297
00:55:35.930 --> 00:55:38.510
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lots of rooms play a space.</v>

1298
00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:40.730
<v Speaker 4>We just uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just kinda settled down.</v>

1299
00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:42.270
<v Speaker 5>Breeding.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You think about that when you're sitting</v>

1300
00:55:42.271 --> 00:55:43.530
<v Speaker 5>in la traffic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>

1301
00:55:43.531 --> 00:55:44.000
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1302
00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:47.330
<v Speaker 4>pays there is out there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why are we all in four feet in la?</v>

1303
00:55:47.331 --> 00:55:51.620
<v Speaker 4>Traffic is no hang right worldwide.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been to Mexico City,</v>

1304
00:55:51.620 --> 00:55:55.190
<v Speaker 4>Mexico City like stoplights aren't even</v>
<v Speaker 4>the suggestion.</v>

1305
00:55:55.670 --> 00:55:58.610
<v Speaker 4>They're just bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody's paying attention to anything.</v>

1306
00:55:59.050 --> 00:56:03.440
<v Speaker 4>It's a perpetual traffic jam and people</v>
<v Speaker 4>just weaseling left and right and like</v>

1307
00:56:03.441 --> 00:56:07.610
<v Speaker 4>in trying to merge into the stream of</v>
<v Speaker 4>perpetual gridlock,</v>

1308
00:56:07.670 --> 00:56:09.740
<v Speaker 4>they just go for it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go for it,</v>

1309
00:56:09.741 --> 00:56:11.270
<v Speaker 4>and all of a sudden they're in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>middle and they go for it.</v>

1310
00:56:11.390 --> 00:56:13.670
<v Speaker 4>No one's letting anybody in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got to catch people that are</v>

1311
00:56:13.671 --> 00:56:15.890
<v Speaker 4>sleeping in or you just got to be really</v>
<v Speaker 4>rude about it.</v>

1312
00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:19.000
<v Speaker 5>And do you think people are people that</v>
<v Speaker 5>people in Mexico City was just like that</v>

1313
00:56:19.001 --> 00:56:20.830
<v Speaker 5>initially or do you think that came from</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1314
00:56:20.831 --> 00:56:23.140
<v Speaker 5>no cop wants to pull someone over</v>
<v Speaker 5>because they don't want to get shot?</v>

1315
00:56:23.170 --> 00:56:24.190
<v Speaker 5>I think it's the population.</v>

1316
00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:26.440
<v Speaker 2>It's too high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just too high.</v>

1317
00:56:26.650 --> 00:56:28.750
<v Speaker 2>Mexico City has an incredible</v>
<v Speaker 2>population.</v>

1318
00:56:28.751 --> 00:56:32.110
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the number one city in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world is Mexico City.</v>

1319
00:56:32.111 --> 00:56:35.190
<v Speaker 2>Number one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tokyo is number was $35 million into</v>

1320
00:56:35.810 --> 00:56:38.770
<v Speaker 2>really 35 dude in Tokyo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have.</v>

1321
00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:42.450
<v Speaker 2>They have people whose job it is to cram</v>
<v Speaker 2>people onto the subway.</v>

1322
00:56:42.510 --> 00:56:46.480
<v Speaker 2>I've seen just the elbow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The people in the subways.</v>

1323
00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:47.321
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about that?</v>

1324
00:56:47.321 --> 00:56:50.380
<v Speaker 2>Thirty 5 million people in the ground</v>
<v Speaker 2>moves every couple of years.</v>

1325
00:56:51.130 --> 00:56:52.630
<v Speaker 2>Good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have Fun.</v>

1326
00:56:52.660 --> 00:56:53.650
<v Speaker 2>Stay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stay together.</v>

1327
00:56:53.651 --> 00:56:56.830
<v Speaker 2>Keep it together people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's interesting.</v>

1328
00:56:57.160 --> 00:56:59.050
<v Speaker 2>Thirty 7 million.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

1329
00:56:59.230 --> 00:57:01.150
<v Speaker 2>Thirty 7 million.</v>
<v Speaker 2>800,000 in Tokyo.</v>

1330
00:57:01.180 --> 00:57:03.180
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's number one and I haven't even.</v>

1331
00:57:03.190 --> 00:57:05.890
<v Speaker 2>Mexico City.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll probably not nearly as many as</v>

1332
00:57:05.891 --> 00:57:07.180
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to say it's.</v>

1333
00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:10.420
<v Speaker 2>I want to say 30,</v>
<v Speaker 2>21.</v>

1334
00:57:11.230 --> 00:57:12.580
<v Speaker 2>We'll go with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's go with.</v>

1335
00:57:13.420 --> 00:57:15.190
<v Speaker 2>Let's go with the better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I said 30.</v>

1336
00:57:15.370 --> 00:57:18.430
<v Speaker 2>Either way it's a totally congested</v>
<v Speaker 2>city.</v>

1337
00:57:18.550 --> 00:57:21.520
<v Speaker 2>It's completely jammed up with people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

1338
00:57:23.020 --> 00:57:25.300
<v Speaker 2>la is on the way to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's on its way.</v>

1339
00:57:25.900 --> 00:57:28.300
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to get there tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll get there in 20 years.</v>

1340
00:57:29.020 --> 00:57:30.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

1341
00:57:30.810 --> 00:57:33.880
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We should all go live out in the middle</v>

1342
00:57:33.881 --> 00:57:34.714
<v Speaker 2>of nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1343
00:57:34.840 --> 00:57:36.070
<v Speaker 2>problem is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a really good spot.</v>

1344
00:57:37.040 --> 00:57:39.170
<v Speaker 2>You know what else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>speaking of how open the country is,</v>

1345
00:57:39.190 --> 00:57:40.930
<v Speaker 2>people fucking are buying up all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>land,</v>

1346
00:57:41.170 --> 00:57:44.160
<v Speaker 2>like the scientologists own all the land</v>
<v Speaker 2>and who was it?</v>

1347
00:57:44.161 --> 00:57:46.240
<v Speaker 2>Ted Turner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a seed guy who created CNN.</v>

1348
00:57:46.360 --> 00:57:49.630
<v Speaker 2>He owns enough land in America that it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>equivalent to the size of Delaware.</v>

1349
00:57:49.930 --> 00:57:52.480
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's balling out of control people,</v>

1350
00:57:52.570 --> 00:57:56.050
<v Speaker 2>but he got rid of Jane Fonda because she</v>
<v Speaker 2>came Christian.</v>

1351
00:57:56.350 --> 00:57:57.640
<v Speaker 2>Is that true?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1352
00:57:58.570 --> 00:58:00.230
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>

1353
00:58:00.260 --> 00:58:01.780
<v Speaker 2>Probably other factors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1354
00:58:02.230 --> 00:58:05.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying it because it's a good</v>
<v Speaker 2>soundbite and that's what I read online.</v>

1355
00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:06.820
<v Speaker 2>She was great and knew who the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 2>knows.</v>

1356
00:58:06.821 --> 00:58:08.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe they just stopped liking</v>
<v Speaker 2>each other.</v>

1357
00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:10.630
<v Speaker 2>Maybe what do I know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do I give a fuck?</v>

1358
00:58:10.690 --> 00:58:12.660
<v Speaker 2>But I just thought it was fascinating</v>
<v Speaker 2>that she became a Christian,</v>

1359
00:58:12.700 --> 00:58:14.200
<v Speaker 2>like really late in life and he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1360
00:58:14.260 --> 00:58:15.230
<v Speaker 2>check.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1361
00:58:15.400 --> 00:58:16.240
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be the same way.</v>

1362
00:58:16.810 --> 00:58:18.790
<v Speaker 2>You can't show up Christian and my door.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on,</v>

1363
00:58:19.080 --> 00:58:21.220
<v Speaker 2>but if you're dating a girl and she was</v>
<v Speaker 2>like super cool,</v>

1364
00:58:21.460 --> 00:58:24.190
<v Speaker 2>but she got into yoga and then she got</v>
<v Speaker 2>an idea cities.</v>

1365
00:58:24.191 --> 00:58:27.760
<v Speaker 2>Then she got his writings of Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He came home one day and she's reading</v>

1366
00:58:27.761 --> 00:58:29.800
<v Speaker 2>the Bible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing?</v>

1367
00:58:30.070 --> 00:58:31.710
<v Speaker 2>That's just an interesting book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1368
00:58:32.610 --> 00:58:34.280
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I picked up this novel and I said,</v>

1369
00:58:34.281 --> 00:58:39.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to live my life by head Turner</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ranch Ted Turner's Weird Faq.</v>

1370
00:58:39.080 --> 00:58:40.990
<v Speaker 2>I keep saying Mr Turner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mr Turner,</v>

1371
00:58:40.991 --> 00:58:43.420
<v Speaker 2>that you say frequently asked questions.</v>

1372
00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:47.830
<v Speaker 2>How large or Mr Turner's landholdings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mr Turner is the second largest</v>

1373
00:58:47.831 --> 00:58:51.440
<v Speaker 2>individual land owner in the united in</v>
<v Speaker 2>North America with the POC summit.</v>

1374
00:58:51.490 --> 00:58:54.520
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Approximately 2 million acres of</v>

1375
00:58:54.521 --> 00:58:58.510
<v Speaker 2>personal and ranch land and the 12 us</v>
<v Speaker 2>states and Argentina.</v>

1376
00:58:59.230 --> 00:59:00.670
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Argentina.</v>

1377
00:59:00.671 --> 00:59:04.300
<v Speaker 2>So now look up how many million acres of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Delaware and we'll see whether I'm</v>

1378
00:59:04.301 --> 00:59:07.960
<v Speaker 2>making shit up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether there's something weird about</v>

1379
00:59:07.961 --> 00:59:10.630
<v Speaker 2>like owning a ranch in Argentina.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's going on,</v>

<v Speaker 2>got a ranch in Argentina.</v>

00:59:31.790 --> 00:59:33.410
<v Speaker 2>Bowling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably more entertaining.</v>

1390
00:59:33.411 --> 00:59:36.140
<v Speaker 2>The Delaware balling out of control.</v>

1391
00:59:36.280 --> 00:59:40.790
<v Speaker 2>He's got a girlfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just ships in Russians probably when you</v>

1392
00:59:40.791 --> 00:59:42.740

<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

1395
00:59:45.180 --> 00:59:47.780
<v Speaker 2>Have you heard the sumner redstone tapes</v>
<v Speaker 2>during the trial?</v>

1396
00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:49.160
<v Speaker 2>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1397
00:59:49.161 --> 00:59:52.250
<v Speaker 2>so he had this big trial and he's like</v>
<v Speaker 2>98 or whatever it is,</v>

1398
00:59:52.251 --> 00:59:55.880
<v Speaker 2>96 or something and the tapes that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>played to show that he was with it were</v>

1399
00:59:55.881 --> 00:59:58.610
<v Speaker 2>him arranging and worksheet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

1400
00:59:58.700 --> 01:00:00.560
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's in his nineties.</v>

1401
01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:01.850
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1402
01:00:01.851 --> 01:00:06.230
<v Speaker 2>then you'll suck me off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And on this guy sumner redstone,</v>

1403
01:00:06.250 --> 01:00:08.870
<v Speaker 2>he's one of the biggest media owners in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world or whatever.</v>

1404
01:00:08.930 --> 01:00:11.330
<v Speaker 2>And how they filled him doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a tape,</v>

1405
01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:14.480
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how it was recorded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was a taped phone call that they</v>

1406
01:00:14.481 --> 01:00:17.990
<v Speaker 2>submitted to show that he was mentally</v>
<v Speaker 2>with lucid,</v>

1407
01:00:17.991 --> 01:00:20.420
<v Speaker 2>but he was lucid because they were</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to take his company from him.</v>

1408
01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:22.610
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's hilarious.</v>

1409
01:00:22.611 --> 01:00:24.980
<v Speaker 2>So he submitted that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does it,</v>

1410
01:00:24.981 --> 01:00:26.600
<v Speaker 2>Ted Turner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the 73 year old billionaire,</v>

1411
01:00:26.601 --> 01:00:29.480
<v Speaker 2>founder of CNN,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has revealed that he has for</v>

1412
01:00:29.481 --> 01:00:32.150
<v Speaker 2>girlfriends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>each of which whom he spends one week</v>

1413
01:00:32.151 --> 01:00:33.860
<v Speaker 2>with a month.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1414
01:00:34.310 --> 01:00:36.130
<v Speaker 2>I love the idea of having four</v>
<v Speaker 2>girlfriends,</v>

1415
01:00:36.131 --> 01:00:37.760
<v Speaker 2>but they've got you nailed down per</v>
<v Speaker 2>week.</v>

1416
01:00:38.090 --> 01:00:40.340
<v Speaker 2>I love him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love him.</v>

1417
01:00:41.870 --> 01:00:44.270
<v Speaker 2>Jane Fonda's probably screaming when</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's reading this.</v>

1418
01:00:44.510 --> 01:00:48.870
<v Speaker 2>Just looking at our screen</v>
<v Speaker 2>that says</v>

1419
01:00:52.070 --> 01:00:54.890
<v Speaker 2>she went to standing rock though Jane</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fonda went to standing rock and fed the</v>

1420
01:00:54.891 --> 01:00:57.520
<v Speaker 2>protesters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They let her off the hook after that.</v>

1421
01:00:57.530 --> 01:01:01.790
<v Speaker 2>Hanoi Jane stuff that thinks she's</v>
<v Speaker 2>finally gotten past that poor girl.</v>

1422
01:01:01.820 --> 01:01:04.310
<v Speaker 2>Don't get in the tank down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get getting the tank when you're like,</v>

1423
01:01:04.340 --> 01:01:06.800
<v Speaker 2>how old was she at the time?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea.</v>

1424
01:01:06.810 --> 01:01:07.740
<v Speaker 2>Twenties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1425
01:01:07.970 --> 01:01:10.890
<v Speaker 2>and when you're that young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey look,</v>

1426
01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:13.460
<v Speaker 2>ma involved and well being in the tank</v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't right,</v>

1427
01:01:13.461 --> 01:01:14.900
<v Speaker 2>but most people would agree she was</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably right.</v>

1428
01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:16.130
<v Speaker 2>That Vietnam shouldn't have been</v>
<v Speaker 2>happening.</v>

1429
01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:17.820
<v Speaker 2>We shouldn't have been bombing hundred</v>
<v Speaker 2>percent.</v>

1430
01:01:17.990 --> 01:01:18.890
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1431
01:01:19.610 --> 01:01:24.350
<v Speaker 2>It's just that message was so confusing</v>
<v Speaker 2>to people because it was the first war</v>

1432
01:01:24.410 --> 01:01:27.680
<v Speaker 2>that we shouldn't have done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like all the sudden we're the bad guy,</v>

1433
01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:31.040
<v Speaker 2>whereas when we're killing native</v>
<v Speaker 2>Americans might have some qualms with</v>

1434
01:01:31.041 --> 01:01:32.630
<v Speaker 2>first we shouldn't have done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

1435
01:01:32.660 --> 01:01:34.880
<v Speaker 2>but you know what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was the first native American was</v>

1436
01:01:34.881 --> 01:01:38.330
<v Speaker 2>more of a genocide that he was a war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean the battles,</v>

1437
01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:39.260
<v Speaker 2>but I mean like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1438
01:01:39.260 --> 01:01:42.800
<v Speaker 2>an army shipping off to do battle with</v>
<v Speaker 2>opposing army.</v>

1439
01:01:42.910 --> 01:01:44.450
<v Speaker 2>This is the first time like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

1440
01:01:44.540 --> 01:01:45.910
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're wrong here.</v>

1441
01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:48.260
<v Speaker 2>And on TV you're seeing the body's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1442
01:01:49.370 --> 01:01:51.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there was a lot of people that were</v>

1443
01:01:51.471 --> 01:01:54.710
<v Speaker 2>trying to protest it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when you're 20 or in your</v>

1444
01:01:54.711 --> 01:01:57.650
<v Speaker 2>twenties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're so clumsy as it is you.</v>

1445
01:01:57.651 --> 01:02:01.250
<v Speaker 2>So it's so likely you're going to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>the message out wrong.</v>

1446
01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:02.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>

1447
01:02:03.890 --> 01:02:05.840
<v Speaker 2>that was the wrong way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She fucked up.</v>

1448
01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:07.790
<v Speaker 2>But I know it Jane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1449
01:02:07.791 --> 01:02:10.910
<v Speaker 2>that stuck with her forever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for decades.</v>

1450
01:02:11.110 --> 01:02:13.250
<v Speaker 2>Many of twitter was around back then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>

1451
01:02:13.310 --> 01:02:17.030
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

1452
01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:20.100
<v Speaker 2>You'd be tarred</v>

1453
01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:21.450
<v Speaker 5>and feathered so quickly.</v>

1454
01:02:21.890 --> 01:02:24.710
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like if she did a reddit ask me anything</v>

1455
01:02:24.711 --> 01:02:25.544
<v Speaker 6>in the seventies,</v>

1456
01:02:28.130 --> 01:02:31.950
<v Speaker 5>I'm in a tank and asked me anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

1457
01:02:32.070 --> 01:02:33.550
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whoops.</v>

1458
01:02:33.790 --> 01:02:35.970
<v Speaker 5>Do you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What are your thoughts on like the,</v>

1459
01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.740
<v Speaker 5>the public shaming,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the mob just get out of hand sometimes.</v>

1460
01:02:39.170 --> 01:02:42.900
<v Speaker 6>Too Fun for people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the problem is it becomes too fun</v>

1461
01:02:43.150 --> 01:02:44.100
<v Speaker 6>to fun to attack</v>

1462
01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:46.300
<v Speaker 5>and they love to see people that got you</v>
<v Speaker 5>going</v>

1463
01:02:46.370 --> 01:02:48.080
<v Speaker 6>fall 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1464
01:02:48.090 --> 01:02:50.480
<v Speaker 6>People love that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's unfortunate.</v>

1465
01:02:50.810 --> 01:02:54.500
<v Speaker 6>It's unfortunate because it's new power</v>
<v Speaker 6>that people have and we're yielding and</v>

1466
01:02:54.501 --> 01:02:57.080
<v Speaker 6>against each other sometimes for the</v>
<v Speaker 6>wrong reasons.</v>

1467
01:02:57.140 --> 01:02:58.940
<v Speaker 6>Sometimes for the right reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1468
01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:01.730
<v Speaker 6>I think um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think certain people who've done</v>

1469
01:03:01.731 --> 01:03:04.550
<v Speaker 6>terrible shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean I couldn't think of any offhand I</v>

1470
01:03:04.551 --> 01:03:06.740
<v Speaker 6>could think of like a lot of those</v>
<v Speaker 6>football players,</v>

1471
01:03:06.741 --> 01:03:08.580
<v Speaker 6>like the one guy knocked his girlfriend</v>
<v Speaker 6>out and in,</v>

1472
01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:12.310
<v Speaker 6>in the elevator like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That guy deserved all that shame.</v>

1473
01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:13.700
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like what the fuck man,</v>

1474
01:03:13.701 --> 01:03:15.380
<v Speaker 6>you just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you punched her in the face,</v>

1475
01:03:15.381 --> 01:03:17.210
<v Speaker 6>like you can't restrain her.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She's trying to hit you.</v>

1476
01:03:17.300 --> 01:03:20.060
<v Speaker 6>So you left hooked her.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Can you grab a hold of her man?</v>

1477
01:03:20.061 --> 01:03:21.530
<v Speaker 6>You're a giant,</v>
<v Speaker 6>big,</v>

1478
01:03:21.531 --> 01:03:24.410
<v Speaker 6>giant super athlete and you killed your</v>
<v Speaker 6>wife.</v>

1479
01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:26.450
<v Speaker 6>That's fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

1480
01:03:26.780 --> 01:03:30.860
<v Speaker 6>I think a lot of us had that sort of</v>
<v Speaker 6>feeling and so when a guy like that gets</v>

1481
01:03:30.861 --> 01:03:33.560
<v Speaker 6>all this blow back for something like</v>
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

1482
01:03:34.430 --> 01:03:35.290
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1483
01:03:35.380 --> 01:03:37.880
<v Speaker 6>it's deserved.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But there's been some people that have</v>

1484
01:03:37.881 --> 01:03:39.770
<v Speaker 6>been attacked for some shit that didn't</v>
<v Speaker 6>make any sense.</v>

1485
01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:40.750
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>absolutely.</v>

1486
01:03:40.930 --> 01:03:41.830
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some.</v>

1487
01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:43.630
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean hell,</v>

1488
01:03:43.631 --> 01:03:45.670
<v Speaker 5>there's that new documentary out on</v>
<v Speaker 5>Amanda Knox.</v>

1489
01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:49.800
<v Speaker 5>Like what do you think about that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's totally innocent if you watch the</v>

1490
01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:50.830
<v Speaker 5>watch the document.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I.</v>

1491
01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:53.680
<v Speaker 5>So here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I went little fill out the story for</v>

1492
01:03:53.780 --> 01:03:55.580
<v Speaker 5>people in Italy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1493
01:03:55.750 --> 01:03:58.150
<v Speaker 5>I went in with kind of a blank mind</v>
<v Speaker 5>because I didn't pay attention to almost</v>

1494
01:03:58.151 --> 01:03:58.984
<v Speaker 5>any of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1495
01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:00.670
<v Speaker 5>when it was happening,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she was,</v>

1496
01:04:00.700 --> 01:04:04.160
<v Speaker 5>she was dumb and I just mean like young</v>
<v Speaker 5>dumb.</v>

1497
01:04:04.190 --> 01:04:06.730
<v Speaker 5>I don't mean young.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just being young,</v>

1498
01:04:06.731 --> 01:04:10.600
<v Speaker 5>dumb a exchange student or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And she's in Italy and she's,</v>

1499
01:04:10.610 --> 01:04:14.320
<v Speaker 5>when she's in a housing unit with a girl</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's kind of friendly with,</v>

1500
01:04:14.650 --> 01:04:16.330
<v Speaker 5>she goes and stays at her boyfriend's</v>
<v Speaker 5>place,</v>

1501
01:04:16.331 --> 01:04:19.630
<v Speaker 5>comes back the next day the door's</v>
<v Speaker 5>locked and I can't get it open,</v>

1502
01:04:19.631 --> 01:04:22.090
<v Speaker 5>but they see some blood on the car.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But they call the cops,</v>

1503
01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:23.590
<v Speaker 5>they opened the door,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the girls,</v>

1504
01:04:23.591 --> 01:04:25.240
<v Speaker 5>dad,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's blood everywhere.</v>

1505
01:04:25.330 --> 01:04:29.780
<v Speaker 5>She's been raped and stabbed and beaten</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then they,</v>

1506
01:04:30.050 --> 01:04:34.510
<v Speaker 5>they found the guy that did it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they were so keen on going after</v>

1507
01:04:34.511 --> 01:04:35.740
<v Speaker 5>Amanda Knox.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was just like,</v>

1508
01:04:35.741 --> 01:04:38.380
<v Speaker 5>it's gotta be her.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then honestly I think what indicted</v>

1509
01:04:38.381 --> 01:04:41.530
<v Speaker 5>or is she seems to be a little off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She seemed that maybe have some</v>

1510
01:04:41.531 --> 01:04:45.100
<v Speaker 5>asperger's or something so she wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 5>behaving emotionally.</v>

1511
01:04:45.101 --> 01:04:48.850
<v Speaker 5>Like people are used to someone behaving</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's all it was.</v>

1512
01:04:48.851 --> 01:04:52.900
<v Speaker 5>It's like she had for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think pretty for sure.</v>

1513
01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:55.300
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

1514
01:04:55.350 --> 01:04:56.510
<v Speaker 5>and so they convicted her,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then they,</v>

1515
01:04:56.710 --> 01:05:01.000
<v Speaker 5>then they found her not guilty and then</v>
<v Speaker 5>they ultimately found her not guilty</v>

1516
01:05:01.001 --> 01:05:02.080
<v Speaker 5>again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So.</v>

1517
01:05:02.170 --> 01:05:03.080
<v Speaker 5>And she,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

1518
01:05:03.081 --> 01:05:04.870
<v Speaker 5>they tried to bring her back to the</v>
<v Speaker 5>country.</v>

1519
01:05:04.871 --> 01:05:06.400
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They tried to bring her back for the</v>

1520
01:05:06.401 --> 01:05:09.130
<v Speaker 5>supreme court trial,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they went along with it anyway.</v>

1521
01:05:09.131 --> 01:05:11.800
<v Speaker 5>She didn't come back and.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But she was found not guilty again</v>

1522
01:05:11.801 --> 01:05:14.680
<v Speaker 5>because the DNA evidence was bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was so contaminated.</v>

1523
01:05:14.681 --> 01:05:15.050
<v Speaker 5>It was.</v>

1524
01:05:15.050 --> 01:05:18.130
<v Speaker 6>And if someone does get pronounced not</v>

1525
01:05:18.130 --> 01:05:22.150
<v Speaker 4>guilty and they've been put through that</v>
<v Speaker 4>Har for all those years,</v>

1526
01:05:22.390 --> 01:05:24.490
<v Speaker 4>did they get any compensation for that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

1527
01:05:24.540 --> 01:05:25.600
<v Speaker 4>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nothing you can do.</v>

1528
01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:28.850
<v Speaker 7>That's scary.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Occasionally when you've got a guy like</v>

1529
01:05:28.851 --> 01:05:30.860
<v Speaker 7>in theu ,</v>
<v Speaker 7>s has been in jail for 30 years.</v>

1530
01:05:30.861 --> 01:05:32.540
<v Speaker 7>They'll give them like a million dollars</v>
<v Speaker 7>or something,</v>

1531
01:05:32.541 --> 01:05:34.340
<v Speaker 7>but it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It doesn't bring their life back.</v>

1532
01:05:34.670 --> 01:05:37.490
<v Speaker 7>That's scary.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's crazy.</v>

1533
01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:38.660
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

1534
01:05:38.690 --> 01:05:41.090
<v Speaker 7>she.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean her life and her boyfriend's life</v>

1535
01:05:41.091 --> 01:05:42.740
<v Speaker 7>were just destroyed and she spent.</v>

1536
01:05:43.090 --> 01:05:48.090
<v Speaker 4>Do you remember that fucking guy who got</v>
<v Speaker 4>accused of being the Olympic Village</v>

1537
01:05:48.251 --> 01:05:52.660
<v Speaker 4>bomber and he was a security guard and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they smeared his name.</v>

1538
01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:54.140
<v Speaker 4>What was his name?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Richard.</v>

1539
01:05:54.630 --> 01:05:57.020

1540
01:05:57.040 --> 01:06:01.630
<v Speaker 4>They put that guy on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They said he was the bomber and he was</v>

1541
01:06:01.631 --> 01:06:04.470
<v Speaker 4>just a regular old security guard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Didn't do anything wrong.</v>

1542
01:06:04.750 --> 01:06:06.910
<v Speaker 7>I was.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was a kid at that Olympics and we were</v>

1543
01:06:06.911 --> 01:06:10.840
<v Speaker 7>deciding whether to go to the next day</v>
<v Speaker 7>after the bombing bomb blew up.</v>

1544
01:06:10.841 --> 01:06:13.670
<v Speaker 7>Did he kill anybody?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Killed one person won't bleed.</v>

1545
01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:15.610
<v Speaker 7>He died of a heart attack.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I believe I was there that night.</v>

1546
01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:18.400
<v Speaker 7>It wasn't there when a bomb went off,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I was going to be like,</v>

1547
01:06:18.401 --> 01:06:19.870
<v Speaker 7>we were going to go to a basketball</v>
<v Speaker 7>game.</v>

1548
01:06:19.930 --> 01:06:24.270
<v Speaker 7>There was like the US Dream Team was</v>
<v Speaker 7>playing and we went to the one sculptor,</v>

<v Speaker 7>so he left,</v>

1550
01:06:25.721 --> 01:06:29.140
<v Speaker 7>but on our way home that happened like</v>
<v Speaker 7>we were on the subway going out to a</v>

1551
01:06:29.141 --> 01:06:31.750
<v Speaker 7>suburb.</v>
<v Speaker 7>My mom was calling everyone around us</v>

1552
01:06:31.751 --> 01:06:35.140
<v Speaker 7>thinking like we got caught in it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I have video of the park,</v>

<v Speaker 7>I'm not like a really cool because I</v>

1555
01:06:40.571 --> 01:06:42.620
<v Speaker 7>wasn't in the bomb,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but like it was there that</v>

<v Speaker 4>Gotham comedy club.</v>

1557
01:06:47.001 --> 01:06:50.240
<v Speaker 4>When the most recent bomb went off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was six blocks away from me.</v>

1558
01:06:50.300 --> 01:06:52.270
<v Speaker 4>He will that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was it?</v>

<v Speaker 4>It hurt a lot of people.</v>

1560

<v Speaker 4>It didn't kill anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it hurt a lot of people.</v>

1561
01:06:57.290 --> 01:07:00.530
<v Speaker 4>It was an unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of those remote controlled pressure</v>

<v Speaker 4>cooker jammies or they set it and he</v>
<v Speaker 4>just walked away from it.</v>

1563

<v Speaker 4>Say this God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fact that someone could just do that</v>

1564

<v Speaker 4>It was all wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He didn't do anything and everybody was</v>

<v Speaker 7>one day his life was destroyed because</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're walking down the street.</v>

<v Speaker 7>Boston monomer.</v>

<v Speaker 7>That's so ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's so ridiculous.</v>

1589
01:08:13.700 --> 01:08:16.000
<v Speaker 7>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's the fucking running</v>

01:09:08.601 --> 01:09:10.750
<v Speaker 5>around the street,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he had actually turned in the gun to</v>

1613
01:09:10.820 --> 01:09:12.560
<v Speaker 5>police officer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Remember that?</v>

1614
01:09:12.710 --> 01:09:14.200
<v Speaker 5>I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do remember that,</v>

1615
01:09:14.201 --> 01:09:15.590
<v Speaker 5>but vaguely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

1616

<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1617
01:09:16.041 --> 01:09:16.874
<v Speaker 5>In Dallas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1618
01:09:17.390 --> 01:09:19.670
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>go ahead.</v>

1619
01:09:19.730 --> 01:09:20.563
<v Speaker 5>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Please go ahead.</v>

1620
01:09:20.730 --> 01:09:21.111
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1621
01:09:21.111 --> 01:09:21.944
<v Speaker 5>I was going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1622
01:09:21.970 --> 01:09:24.390
<v Speaker 5>you know what I wish people were still</v>
<v Speaker 5>talking about with the Boston bombing is</v>

1623
01:09:24.410 --> 01:09:26.900
<v Speaker 5>there was a third guy who wasn't there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They said he was friends with the</v>

1624
01:09:26.901 --> 01:09:28.280
<v Speaker 5>bombers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so they wanted to interview him.</v>

1625
01:09:28.460 --> 01:09:30.650
<v Speaker 5>The FBI goes down to what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Florida,</v>

1626
01:09:30.651 --> 01:09:32.900
<v Speaker 5>Georgia,</v>
<v Speaker 5>somewhere interviews and four times the</v>

1627
01:09:32.901 --> 01:09:35.120
<v Speaker 5>fourth time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they admit he was unarmed.</v>

1628
01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:37.340
<v Speaker 5>They shoot him seven times.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Once in the back of the head.</v>

1629
01:09:37.990 --> 01:09:41.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Abraham to have just executed the guy.</v>

1630
01:09:41.350 --> 01:09:41.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1631
01:09:41.780 --> 01:09:43.400
<v Speaker 5>The FBI did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then they came out and said,</v>

1632
01:09:43.430 --> 01:09:44.180
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he had a gun.</v>

1633
01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:45.110
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he had a knife,</v>

1634
01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:45.641
<v Speaker 5>A.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1635
01:09:45.641 --> 01:09:46.880
<v Speaker 5>nevermind.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He had a stick.</v>

1636
01:09:47.150 --> 01:09:47.861
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well we,</v>

1637
01:09:47.861 --> 01:09:50.720
<v Speaker 5>he didn't have any weapons,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we feared for our lives and it's</v>

1638
01:09:50.721 --> 01:09:52.640
<v Speaker 5>like you're the fourth interview with</v>
<v Speaker 5>the guy.</v>

1639
01:09:52.970 --> 01:09:55.620
<v Speaker 2>You just execute him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

1640
01:09:56.020 --> 01:10:01.020
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what better way to get the cute boy</v>

1641
01:10:01.820 --> 01:10:05.420
<v Speaker 2>on the rolling stone cover to talk to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pump?</v>

1642
01:10:05.430 --> 01:10:07.640
<v Speaker 2>Seven bullets into your friend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his friend.</v>

1643
01:10:07.700 --> 01:10:11.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how you get to do the talk and</v>

1644
01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:12.500
<v Speaker 2>here's a picture of your friend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1645
01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:13.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just shot him in the fucking head.</v>

1646
01:10:13.851 --> 01:10:17.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to shoot you to tell me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tell me who told you to do this.</v>

1647
01:10:18.180 --> 01:10:20.270
<v Speaker 2>You have to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck fuckface here's a video on my</v>

1648
01:10:20.271 --> 01:10:21.620
<v Speaker 2>phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just so you know that I really shot your</v>

1649
01:10:21.621 --> 01:10:23.270
<v Speaker 2>friend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's.</v>

1650
01:10:23.390 --> 01:10:26.590
<v Speaker 2>But that's our media.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How is that not a story basically.</v>

1651
01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:28.580
<v Speaker 2>Basically never mentioned in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>meeting.</v>

1652
01:10:28.610 --> 01:10:30.370
<v Speaker 2>Like really briefly mentioned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1653
01:10:30.420 --> 01:10:32.270
<v Speaker 2>so briefly that I forgot about it until</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just brought it up.</v>

1654
01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:34.450
<v Speaker 2>I had totally forgotten about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1655
01:10:34.460 --> 01:10:35.450
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Jack Back Guy,</v>

1656
01:10:36.380 --> 01:10:39.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're like fucking guy's a bad guy.</v>

1657
01:10:40.580 --> 01:10:42.890
<v Speaker 2>Friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was friends with fucked up,</v>

1658
01:10:43.230 --> 01:10:44.680
<v Speaker 2>fucked up shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Been hanging around.</v>

1659
01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:48.190
<v Speaker 2>Thought about who his father was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she thought about those friends were too</v>

1660
01:10:49.770 --> 01:10:53.060
<v Speaker 2>God damn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's people that have that kind of</v>

1661
01:10:53.061 --> 01:10:56.570
<v Speaker 2>power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's an enormous responsibility.</v>

1662
01:10:56.571 --> 01:10:59.210
<v Speaker 2>You have a gun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're job is part of your job is to</v>

1663
01:10:59.211 --> 01:11:01.010
<v Speaker 2>shoot people when they fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1664
01:11:01.011 --> 01:11:01.910
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1665
01:11:02.090 --> 01:11:03.500
<v Speaker 2>and you're at the highest level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1666
01:11:03.510 --> 01:11:05.300
<v Speaker 2>You're the FBI,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're there to protect national</v>

1667
01:11:05.301 --> 01:11:07.700
<v Speaker 2>security,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Federal Bureau of Information.</v>

1668
01:11:08.210 --> 01:11:11.330
<v Speaker 2>I feel like they're not taught how to</v>
<v Speaker 2>deescalate shit.</v>

1669
01:11:11.331 --> 01:11:13.440
<v Speaker 2>They're only taught how to ask you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure they're taught how to</v>

1670
01:11:13.441 --> 01:11:14.040
<v Speaker 2>deescalate.</v>

1671
01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:16.260
<v Speaker 4>I'm absolutely sure that they don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>stick with that training.</v>

1672
01:11:16.261 --> 01:11:19.500
<v Speaker 4>Let's just say that there are people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a real problem with giving</v>

1673
01:11:19.501 --> 01:11:20.790
<v Speaker 4>people power,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1674
01:11:21.210 --> 01:11:24.340
<v Speaker 4>giving anyone power over other people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like that's a,</v>

1675
01:11:24.750 --> 01:11:29.010
<v Speaker 4>it's a very intoxicating position.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Especially like the kind of life or</v>

1676
01:11:29.011 --> 01:11:32.190
<v Speaker 4>death power someone with a gun has and</v>
<v Speaker 4>people don't want to listen to you.</v>

1677
01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:36.690
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the other thing is like how many</v>

1678
01:11:36.691 --> 01:11:40.050
<v Speaker 4>people could handle that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 4>pressure day in,</v>

1679
01:11:40.051 --> 01:11:43.490
<v Speaker 4>day out for 10 years or 20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I totally agree.</v>

1680
01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:45.030
<v Speaker 4>Those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a shitload of pressure,</v>

1681
01:11:45.031 --> 01:11:47.070
<v Speaker 4>but that still means we're doing</v>
<v Speaker 4>something wrong.</v>

1682
01:11:47.071 --> 01:11:48.310
<v Speaker 4>If they're executing people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1683
01:11:48.311 --> 01:11:48.930
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh look,</v>

1684
01:11:48.930 --> 01:11:51.150
<v Speaker 4>it's 100 percent wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's 100 percent wrong,</v>

1685
01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:55.410
<v Speaker 4>but the whole stew is wrong from</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything we've discussed from people,</v>

1686
01:11:55.411 --> 01:11:58.230
<v Speaker 4>anybody being able to have a person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I don't have any solution for.</v>

1687
01:11:58.230 --> 01:12:01.170
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a eugenics guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying I'm not offering up any</v>

1688
01:12:01.171 --> 01:12:05.130
<v Speaker 4>sort of crazy solution.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All I'm saying is we all agree that part</v>

1689
01:12:05.131 --> 01:12:07.740
<v Speaker 4>of the problem is people get raised by</v>
<v Speaker 4>horrible,</v>

1690
01:12:07.741 --> 01:12:11.940
<v Speaker 4>awful people who abused them and beat</v>
<v Speaker 4>them and rape them and they're subjected</v>

1691
01:12:11.941 --> 01:12:15.150
<v Speaker 4>to all sorts of horrible shit as are</v>
<v Speaker 4>growing up and they develop all fucked</v>

1692
01:12:15.151 --> 01:12:18.840
<v Speaker 4>up and we all know people like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're just all fucked up and those</v>

1693
01:12:18.841 --> 01:12:20.160
<v Speaker 4>people would just cast out into the</v>
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>

1694
01:12:20.250 --> 01:12:22.590
<v Speaker 4>And this is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is what our world is made up.</v>

1695
01:12:22.650 --> 01:12:25.140
<v Speaker 4>Our world is made out of people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean our civilization at least.</v>

1696
01:12:25.170 --> 01:12:27.300
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is why I think,</v>

1697
01:12:27.330 --> 01:12:29.490
<v Speaker 4>and maybe people will get behind me on</v>
<v Speaker 4>this there,</v>

1698
01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:32.010
<v Speaker 4>so the numbers are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's rough,</v>

1699
01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:35.520
<v Speaker 4>but they think in a sociopath test about</v>
<v Speaker 4>pet test,</v>

1700
01:12:35.521 --> 01:12:40.290
<v Speaker 4>about one out of every hundred people is</v>
<v Speaker 4>a sociopath and those people usually do</v>

1701
01:12:40.291 --> 01:12:41.850
<v Speaker 4>really well in business.</v>

1702
01:12:42.060 --> 01:12:45.690
<v Speaker 4>They get to the top of corporations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they become president of United States</v>

1703
01:12:45.930 --> 01:12:49.460
<v Speaker 4>and it's like we should have a sociopath</v>
<v Speaker 4>test for high ranking of it.</v>

1704
01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:53.940
<v Speaker 4>You'd have to completely define it as</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone who really doesn't have feelings</v>

1705
01:12:53.941 --> 01:12:54.870
<v Speaker 4>for other people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1706
01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.120
<v Speaker 4>You'd have to be able to really nail</v>
<v Speaker 4>that down,</v>

1707
01:12:57.150 --> 01:13:01.530
<v Speaker 4>but feelings are so emotions and</v>
<v Speaker 4>emotional connections and empathy.</v>

1708
01:13:01.950 --> 01:13:05.700
<v Speaker 4>It's such a poorly defined thing because</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone who watches a lot of movies and</v>

1709
01:13:05.701 --> 01:13:07.920
<v Speaker 4>reads a lot of books,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can say the right words.</v>

1710
01:13:08.170 --> 01:13:11.070
<v Speaker 4>If you're a manipulator.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I without actually feeling it,</v>

1711
01:13:11.071 --> 01:13:13.110
<v Speaker 4>you could say all the right words,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

1712
01:13:13.170 --> 01:13:14.650
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It happens to people all the time in</v>

1713
01:13:14.651 --> 01:13:16.470
<v Speaker 4>relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1714
01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:17.490
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>girl me to guy,</v>

1715
01:13:17.491 --> 01:13:20.880
<v Speaker 4>he's charming and he tells her he loves</v>
<v Speaker 4>her and I mean really just as like he's</v>

1716
01:13:20.970 --> 01:13:23.400
<v Speaker 4>doing stuff that he saw in a movie and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then,</v>

1717
01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:25.440
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe four or five months in she</v>

1718
01:13:25.441 --> 01:13:26.131
<v Speaker 4>realizes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>

1719
01:13:26.131 --> 01:13:27.480
<v Speaker 4>he's a total psychopath.</v>

1720
01:13:28.010 --> 01:13:31.830
<v Speaker 4>And like he's just saying things not to</v>
<v Speaker 4>say anything.</v>

1721
01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:34.700
<v Speaker 4>He just knew how to say the right things</v>
<v Speaker 4>were the right Cologne,</v>

1722
01:13:34.740 --> 01:13:37.050
<v Speaker 4>whatever it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>say the right things at the right time</v>

1723
01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:40.650
<v Speaker 4>because he's had a lot of practice and</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the end of it,</v>

1724
01:13:40.710 --> 01:13:43.350
<v Speaker 4>and there's a person who's like</v>
<v Speaker 4>literally barely a person,</v>

1725
01:13:43.351 --> 01:13:46.410
<v Speaker 4>like some sort of a robot reciting</v>
<v Speaker 4>things,</v>

1726
01:13:46.460 --> 01:13:47.293
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was,</v>

1727
01:13:47.430 --> 01:13:48.590
<v Speaker 4>did you ever read,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1728
01:13:48.900 --> 01:13:51.300
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was the Bret Easton Ellis book?</v>

1729
01:13:51.450 --> 01:13:54.090
<v Speaker 4>They turned into a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bradley Cooper.</v>

1730
01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:55.050
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>American psycho.</v>

1731
01:13:55.310 --> 01:13:56.143
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1732
01:13:56.870 --> 01:13:58.770
<v Speaker 4>Psycho.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's a Christian Bale.</v>

1733
01:13:59.490 --> 01:14:00.680
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bret Easton Ellis.</v>

1734
01:14:00.681 --> 01:14:03.030
<v Speaker 4>This book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the book is terrifying.</v>

1735
01:14:03.031 --> 01:14:05.100
<v Speaker 4>It's way more terrifying than the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't,</v>

1736
01:14:05.250 --> 01:14:07.050
<v Speaker 4>I didn't read the book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The book is awful.</v>

1737
01:14:07.140 --> 01:14:09.540
<v Speaker 4>I remember like people not awful like a</v>
<v Speaker 4>bad book,</v>

1738
01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:12.100
<v Speaker 4>like it's really well written,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's awful like holy</v>

1739
01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:14.680
<v Speaker 5>shit and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how much did the trump kids look like?</v>

1740
01:14:14.681 --> 01:14:16.990
<v Speaker 5>American psycho.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like they're trying,</v>

1741
01:14:17.620 --> 01:14:18.850
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how do you look if your dad's a</v>

1742
01:14:18.851 --> 01:14:20.770
<v Speaker 5>billionaire?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He probably can't look any other way.</v>

1743
01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:25.230
<v Speaker 4>I have two options.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You go all in with pops and you join the</v>

1744
01:14:25.231 --> 01:14:30.180
<v Speaker 4>family business or you become like that</v>
<v Speaker 4>surfer dude who like a band.</v>

1745
01:14:30.181 --> 01:14:32.910
<v Speaker 4>When we really got into drugs and we</v>
<v Speaker 4>brought in into counseling,</v>

1746
01:14:34.170 --> 01:14:37.200
<v Speaker 4>fell far from the tree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can be like in the Malibu,</v>

1747
01:14:37.201 --> 01:14:38.430
<v Speaker 4>Rehab,</v>
<v Speaker 4>perfect.</v>

1748
01:14:38.550 --> 01:14:42.900
<v Speaker 4>Permanently with flip flops on you feet</v>
<v Speaker 4>up and they keep you sober,</v>

1749
01:14:42.901 --> 01:14:44.140
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you just like to surf.</v>

1750
01:14:45.330 --> 01:14:46.890
<v Speaker 4>Your Dad just pays for your treatment.</v>

1751
01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:50.510
<v Speaker 5>I mean they have like a special kind of</v>
<v Speaker 5>hair gel for like the kids of</v>

1752
01:14:50.511 --> 01:14:52.340
<v Speaker 5>billionaires.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how they slick it back like</v>

1753
01:14:52.350 --> 01:14:52.940
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

1754
01:14:52.940 --> 01:14:54.440
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's liberal tears.</v>

1755
01:14:54.620 --> 01:14:58.940
<v Speaker 4>They just scoop amount of buckets of</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hillary Clinton rallies.</v>

1756
01:14:58.970 --> 01:15:01.300
<v Speaker 4>They just kick liberals in the balls,</v>
<v Speaker 4>collect the tears.</v>

1757
01:15:03.790 --> 01:15:05.940
<v Speaker 4>They just went around that night.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We all,</v>

1758
01:15:05.941 --> 01:15:07.460
<v Speaker 4>the people were crying when Hillary</v>
<v Speaker 4>lost.</v>

1759
01:15:07.461 --> 01:15:11.630
<v Speaker 4>They just gathered them up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gathered up those tears and nice slick</v>

1760
01:15:11.631 --> 01:15:13.550
<v Speaker 4>their hair back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1761
01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:17.540
<v Speaker 4>I think that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be interesting.</v>

1762
01:15:17.990 --> 01:15:19.640
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1763
01:15:19.641 --> 01:15:21.950
<v Speaker 4>we're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Find out how much power the president</v>

1764
01:15:22.010 --> 01:15:24.010
<v Speaker 4>actually has to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because like that,</v>

1765
01:15:24.530 --> 01:15:25.940
<v Speaker 4>this trump election,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let us know,</v>

1766
01:15:25.941 --> 01:15:28.310
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the system actually does work.</v>

1767
01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:32.690
<v Speaker 4>Like someone can come in that's not</v>
<v Speaker 4>being represented by their party.</v>

1768
01:15:32.691 --> 01:15:35.960
<v Speaker 4>The party didn't want him in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Someone can come in and still win,</v>

1769
01:15:36.370 --> 01:15:38.740
<v Speaker 5>but sadly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so far Bernie Sanders got closed.</v>

1770
01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:41.290
<v Speaker 5>But right now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>only if you have a billion dollars.</v>

1771
01:15:41.380 --> 01:15:43.570
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I think</v>

1772
01:15:43.780 --> 01:15:45.160
<v Speaker 4>that's going to change.</v>
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>

1773
01:15:45.161 --> 01:15:47.590
<v Speaker 4>no one liked Bernie ever existed before</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bernie.</v>

1774
01:15:47.620 --> 01:15:48.370
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Agreed.</v>

1775
01:15:48.370 --> 01:15:49.840
<v Speaker 4>So all of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bernie comes in.</v>

1776
01:15:49.900 --> 01:15:53.890
<v Speaker 4>Now here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If trump's policies start working out,</v>

1777
01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:54.993
<v Speaker 4>that's when everyone's</v>

1778
01:15:55.100 --> 01:15:56.390
<v Speaker 5>fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If he,</v>

1779
01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:58.520
<v Speaker 5>if all of a sudden we realize,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1780
01:15:58.521 --> 01:15:59.870
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here were the log jams.</v>

1781
01:15:59.871 --> 01:16:01.700
<v Speaker 5>He's right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like Holy Shit,</v>

1782
01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:04.130
<v Speaker 5>we're prospering is holy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>

1783
01:16:04.131 --> 01:16:07.580
<v Speaker 5>all this good stuff that's happening</v>
<v Speaker 5>does have massive infrastructure</v>

1784
01:16:07.581 --> 01:16:11.360
<v Speaker 5>projects that put people to work so that</v>
<v Speaker 5>he can have his name trump across the</v>

1785
01:16:11.361 --> 01:16:13.040
<v Speaker 5>bullets to the trump train,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the trump,</v>

1786
01:16:13.041 --> 01:16:13.874
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>trump that.</v>

1787
01:16:14.030 --> 01:16:16.700
<v Speaker 5>Even if he just does that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that could make people pretty happy.</v>

1788
01:16:17.180 --> 01:16:18.110
<v Speaker 5>People very happy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1789
01:16:18.220 --> 01:16:20.740
<v Speaker 4>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's interesting because he's a total</v>

1790
01:16:20.741 --> 01:16:25.180
<v Speaker 4>outsider who has paid off the insiders</v>
<v Speaker 4>for a long time.</v>

1791
01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:27.430
<v Speaker 5>If now he's in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If he follows through,</v>

1792
01:16:27.431 --> 01:16:30.400
<v Speaker 5>here's the scary thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is in a way,</v>

1793
01:16:30.430 --> 01:16:35.430
<v Speaker 5>if he follows through with just</v>
<v Speaker 5>bringing us back from bombing every</v>

1794
01:16:35.501 --> 01:16:38.440
<v Speaker 5>country,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like that alone could be a big step</v>

1795
01:16:38.441 --> 01:16:38.981
<v Speaker 5>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1796
01:16:38.981 --> 01:16:41.950
<v Speaker 5>we needed a fucking crazy motherfucker</v>
<v Speaker 5>to do that.</v>

1797
01:16:42.310 --> 01:16:45.250
<v Speaker 5>To finally say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why are we in all these other countries</v>

1798
01:16:46.410 --> 01:16:49.420
<v Speaker 5>and start to say this for me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was already basic.</v>

1799
01:16:49.421 --> 01:16:49.960
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

1800
01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:53.350
<v Speaker 5>Protestors and him stopped the TPP,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the transpacific partnership,</v>

1801
01:16:53.710 --> 01:16:57.910
<v Speaker 5>the fucking largest corporate coo that's</v>
<v Speaker 5>ever been devised and basically,</v>

1802
01:16:57.911 --> 01:16:59.680
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he said he wasn't going to sign it.</v>

1803
01:16:59.681 --> 01:17:00.940
<v Speaker 5>Now here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's not.</v>

1804
01:17:01.090 --> 01:17:03.370
<v Speaker 5>He's going to create a new trade deals,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it's going to be awful.</v>

1805
01:17:03.430 --> 01:17:06.940
<v Speaker 5>He's going to put that forward so it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>not like he's done creating havoc in</v>

1806
01:17:06.941 --> 01:17:09.800
<v Speaker 5>that way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the fact that the TPP is over is a</v>

1807
01:17:09.801 --> 01:17:10.280
<v Speaker 5>huge</v>

1808
01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:11.420
<v Speaker 2>step.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

1809
01:17:11.510 --> 01:17:14.930
<v Speaker 2>It's an interesting step and what I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying earlier that one of the things</v>

1810
01:17:14.931 --> 01:17:19.520
<v Speaker 2>that a lot of people said that I agree</v>
<v Speaker 2>with is that I think him being a</v>

1811
01:17:19.521 --> 01:17:23.300
<v Speaker 2>populist and him being really interested</v>
<v Speaker 2>in public's opinion and what people</v>

1812
01:17:23.301 --> 01:17:28.301
<v Speaker 2>think about him is actually a good thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>because when certain things he says like</v>

1813
01:17:28.610 --> 01:17:32.690
<v Speaker 2>you off the cuff says shit off the cuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then he finds out that is really a</v>

1814
01:17:32.691 --> 01:17:36.590
<v Speaker 2>stupid thing to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He amends like what he says and I think</v>

1815
01:17:36.591 --> 01:17:41.510
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of interesting because like</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he starts to talk about some specific</v>

1816
01:17:41.511 --> 01:17:44.930
<v Speaker 2>set of regulations or rules and then the</v>
<v Speaker 2>public starts freaking out about it,</v>

1817
01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:48.380
<v Speaker 2>it's very likely he might reconsider if</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes sense.</v>

1818
01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:50.320
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is how he's kind of like a standup</v>

1819
01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:52.460
<v Speaker 2>comic because he was going from speech</v>
<v Speaker 2>to speech.</v>

1820
01:17:52.461 --> 01:17:53.030
<v Speaker 2>Basically.</v>

1821
01:17:53.030 --> 01:17:55.760
<v Speaker 2>He would weed out the stuff that wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting a huge reaction.</v>

1822
01:17:55.940 --> 01:17:59.090
<v Speaker 2>Keep the stuff that got a big reaction</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was just a greatest hits.</v>

1823
01:17:59.091 --> 01:18:01.010
<v Speaker 2>He was just playing the hits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just doing a set.</v>

1824
01:18:01.050 --> 01:18:02.780
<v Speaker 2>You have a strong set and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but dude,</v>

1825
01:18:02.781 --> 01:18:05.780
<v Speaker 2>by the end of the election,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like after all the grab the pussy stuff</v>

1826
01:18:05.781 --> 01:18:10.250
<v Speaker 2>and after the last debate he was doing a</v>
<v Speaker 2>run of these speeches and I tuned into</v>

1827
01:18:10.251 --> 01:18:13.190
<v Speaker 2>one of them and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy sounds pretty reasonable right</v>

1828
01:18:13.191 --> 01:18:14.930
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like right now in this moment,</v>

1829
01:18:14.931 --> 01:18:18.200
<v Speaker 2>if you could like take this snippet</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of the other snippets when he's</v>

1830
01:18:18.201 --> 01:18:20.210
<v Speaker 2>gone to the wall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just got 10 feet higher.</v>

1831
01:18:21.570 --> 01:18:24.580
<v Speaker 2>Instead of that take this snippet and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go with this guy.</v>

1832
01:18:24.620 --> 01:18:26.300
<v Speaker 2>Very reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's talking about corruption.</v>

1833
01:18:26.301 --> 01:18:29.480
<v Speaker 2>He's talking about deep suited,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the deep seated red tape.</v>

1834
01:18:29.481 --> 01:18:33.080
<v Speaker 2>It's almost impossible to remove because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an ecosystem and all these people,</v>

1835
01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:37.160
<v Speaker 2>they had been feeding off of each other</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the bureaucracy roots run deep and</v>

1836
01:18:37.161 --> 01:18:38.180
<v Speaker 2>you just got to pull it out.</v>

1837
01:18:38.350 --> 01:18:40.790
<v Speaker 2>You've got to drain the swamp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I totally agree with all that.</v>

1838
01:18:40.791 --> 01:18:42.500
<v Speaker 2>The problem is now you look at his</v>
<v Speaker 2>cabinet,</v>

1839
01:18:42.501 --> 01:18:45.860
<v Speaker 2>he's grabbing the same swan things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Putting them,</v>

1840
01:18:45.950 --> 01:18:48.210
<v Speaker 2>well billionaire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's putting the swamp things baggy.</v>

1841
01:18:48.220 --> 01:18:49.730
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's talking about Patraeus.</v>

1842
01:18:49.731 --> 01:18:51.440
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all these,</v>

1843
01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:53.270
<v Speaker 2>all these assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

1844
01:18:53.290 --> 01:18:53.840
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1845
01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:55.850
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who he ended up going with</v>

1846
01:18:55.851 --> 01:18:57.890
<v Speaker 2>for treasury secretary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was talking about Jamie diamond</v>

1847
01:18:57.891 --> 01:19:00.230
<v Speaker 2>for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fucking head of Citibank.</v>

1848
01:19:01.050 --> 01:19:04.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry jp Morgan Chase that was behind</v>

1849
01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:08.290
<v Speaker 2>the collabs bind what created.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Occupied.</v>

1850
01:19:08.291 --> 01:19:11.750
<v Speaker 2>Like he's putting the swamp things back</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the swamp he's drained at and now</v>

1851
01:19:11.751 --> 01:19:14.080
<v Speaker 2>he's putting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was he trying to portray us in for?</v>

1852
01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:16.580
<v Speaker 2>Had a defense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1853
01:19:16.760 --> 01:19:18.590
<v Speaker 2>That's an interesting choice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1854
01:19:18.591 --> 01:19:22.280
<v Speaker 2>You might want to verify that trace</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing is fascinating because portrays,</v>

1855
01:19:22.281 --> 01:19:24.740
<v Speaker 2>didn't do anything that was really that</v>
<v Speaker 2>awful.</v>

1856
01:19:24.740 --> 01:19:28.010
<v Speaker 2>He had an affair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He leaked information.</v>

1857
01:19:28.070 --> 01:19:29.090
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what did he do?</v>

1858
01:19:29.091 --> 01:19:31.400
<v Speaker 2>He leaked information to this girlfriend</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he was dating.</v>

1859
01:19:31.930 --> 01:19:34.190
<v Speaker 2>She will follow up with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How heavy was it?</v>

1860
01:19:34.220 --> 01:19:36.030
<v Speaker 2>Like what was the information?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the information.</v>

1861
01:19:36.060 --> 01:19:37.220
<v Speaker 2>Was it top secret?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1862
01:19:37.550 --> 01:19:41.180
<v Speaker 2>A secretary of state supporters he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking for.</v>

1863
01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:42.171
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1864
01:19:42.171 --> 01:19:44.450
<v Speaker 2>he's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's an interesting case because he's a</v>

1865
01:19:44.451 --> 01:19:49.250
<v Speaker 2>case of the FBI and the CIA don't like</v>
<v Speaker 2>each other that much.</v>

1866
01:19:49.420 --> 01:19:51.890
<v Speaker 2>That's where this came from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what's so fascinating about it.</v>

1867
01:19:51.900 --> 01:19:56.900
<v Speaker 2>Patraeus was running the CIA,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the FBI does an investigation on the CIA</v>

1868
01:19:57.080 --> 01:20:01.340
<v Speaker 2>because portray us is banging this chick</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she's crazy and she likes to send</v>

1869
01:20:01.341 --> 01:20:02.960
<v Speaker 2>crazy emails to people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>

1870
01:20:02.961 --> 01:20:07.600
<v Speaker 2>he was banging some nutty abroad and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so that's what sunk this,</v>

1871
01:20:07.640 --> 01:20:10.440
<v Speaker 2>this crazy lady was making some noise</v>
<v Speaker 2>threatening people.</v>

1872
01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:13.290
<v Speaker 2>She was threatening certain people and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they want who's,</v>

1873
01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:15.520
<v Speaker 2>what's going on here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it turns out there collect kinda</v>

1874
01:20:15.550 --> 01:20:20.550
<v Speaker 2>swinger type characters or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Petraeus was hitting it hollow and next</v>

1875
01:20:20.881 --> 01:20:25.350
<v Speaker 2>thing you know this and then portray has</v>
<v Speaker 2>had an affair with this other woman</v>

1876
01:20:25.351 --> 01:20:27.420
<v Speaker 2>who's writing an autobiography on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what it was.</v>

1877
01:20:27.450 --> 01:20:32.040
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm remembering the autobiography</v>
<v Speaker 2>woman and the other lady got into it and</v>

1878
01:20:32.041 --> 01:20:33.620
<v Speaker 2>then I didn't follow any of those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1879
01:20:33.621 --> 01:20:34.170
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1880
01:20:34.170 --> 01:20:38.610
<v Speaker 2>And so the CIA was like a what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the FBI was like,</v>

1881
01:20:38.670 --> 01:20:41.730
<v Speaker 2>fuck's going on over here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then that's how we wound up getting</v>

1882
01:20:42.030 --> 01:20:43.980
<v Speaker 2>in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where it all went down.</v>

1883
01:20:43.981 --> 01:20:45.060
<v Speaker 2>That's why he got stripped.</v>

1884
01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:49.340
<v Speaker 5>I covered him when he.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he got into fracking.</v>

1885
01:20:49.341 --> 01:20:53.170
<v Speaker 5>He was the front of a corporation that</v>
<v Speaker 5>was pushing fracking around the US,</v>

1886
01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:56.720
<v Speaker 5>post his.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm removed from the army after that and</v>

1887
01:20:56.721 --> 01:20:59.680
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he had a year or two doing this and they</v>

1888
01:20:59.810 --> 01:21:02.870
<v Speaker 5>said they fly him out to North Dakota</v>
<v Speaker 5>where all the fracking is going on.</v>

1889
01:21:03.260 --> 01:21:08.000
<v Speaker 5>And he's introduced by the one of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>higher ups in North Dakota government.</v>

1890
01:21:08.001 --> 01:21:10.760
<v Speaker 5>I can't remember if it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't remember what her job was,</v>

1891
01:21:10.761 --> 01:21:12.830
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>lieutenant governor or something and she</v>

1892
01:21:12.831 --> 01:21:15.110
<v Speaker 5>introduces him and she's clearly not</v>
<v Speaker 5>very bright and she introduces him.</v>

1893
01:21:15.111 --> 01:21:17.860
<v Speaker 5>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was such a privilege to have David</v>

1894
01:21:17.860 --> 01:21:18.890
<v Speaker 5>Petraeus here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's here,</v>

1895
01:21:19.070 --> 01:21:23.270
<v Speaker 5>he's talking about fracking so that we</v>
<v Speaker 5>never have to go overseas to get the oil</v>

1896
01:21:23.271 --> 01:21:26.630
<v Speaker 5>we need like we did in Iraq.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it was like,</v>

1897
01:21:27.050 --> 01:21:28.820
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're not supposed to admit that we</v>

1898
01:21:28.821 --> 01:21:30.450
<v Speaker 5>went to get the oil.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's part of it.</v>

1899
01:21:30.590 --> 01:21:31.940
<v Speaker 5>That's part of the secret.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1900
01:21:32.210 --> 01:21:33.650
<v Speaker 5>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he goes up and he's just like,</v>

1901
01:21:33.651 --> 01:21:35.420
<v Speaker 5>thank you for that lovely introduction.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like,</v>

1902
01:21:35.510 --> 01:21:36.380
<v Speaker 5>she just said that</v>

1903
01:21:36.510 --> 01:21:40.070
<v Speaker 2>went to war for oil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is not supposed to be what you're</v>

1904
01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:41.630
<v Speaker 2>admitting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you,</v>

1905
01:21:41.660 --> 01:21:42.690
<v Speaker 2>you're supposed to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1906
01:21:42.691 --> 01:21:44.190
<v Speaker 2>we went to war for freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1907
01:21:44.191 --> 01:21:46.630
<v Speaker 2>We're given an Iraqi freedom whenever</v>
<v Speaker 2>they go,</v>

1908
01:21:46.980 --> 01:21:49.380
<v Speaker 2>wow works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he's not responsible for her.</v>

1909
01:21:49.381 --> 01:21:51.660
<v Speaker 2>He's probably just being polite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to have to correct her</v>

1910
01:21:51.661 --> 01:21:53.760
<v Speaker 2>ma'am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We actually went to war for freedom.</v>

1911
01:21:53.761 --> 01:21:55.140
<v Speaker 2>For Freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1912
01:21:55.410 --> 01:21:57.720
<v Speaker 2>This is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is incorrect.</v>

1913
01:21:58.430 --> 01:22:00.120
<v Speaker 2>I can continue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1914
01:22:00.121 --> 01:22:02.730
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was teaching at City College.</v>

1915
01:22:03.270 --> 01:22:06.300
<v Speaker 2>And do you ever see those protests where</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'd walk to his car and they'd be</v>

1916
01:22:06.301 --> 01:22:11.301
<v Speaker 2>screaming criminal war commodore and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's great war criminals.</v>

1917
01:22:11.580 --> 01:22:13.920
<v Speaker 2>I think that these kids need to face</v>
<v Speaker 2>that shit.</v>

1918
01:22:13.921 --> 01:22:16.260
<v Speaker 2>They should see people in their driveway</v>
<v Speaker 2>yelling at him.</v>

1919
01:22:17.160 --> 01:22:18.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's um,</v>

1920
01:22:19.020 --> 01:22:24.020
<v Speaker 2>it's real interesting that you could get</v>
<v Speaker 2>taken down like him just because you</v>

1921
01:22:25.411 --> 01:22:26.790
<v Speaker 2>were having an affair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he,</v>

1922
01:22:26.820 --> 01:22:31.500
<v Speaker 2>they got him out because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a because of adultery and because</v>

1923
01:22:31.510 --> 01:22:33.030
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the top secret clearance stuff.</v>

1924
01:22:33.031 --> 01:22:34.080
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1925
01:22:34.081 --> 01:22:36.870
<v Speaker 2>I think the adults or anything but just</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make him look bad,</v>

1926
01:22:36.871 --> 01:22:40.860
<v Speaker 2>but it was really the leaking leg to his</v>
<v Speaker 2>girlfriend who was writing books.</v>

1927
01:22:40.861 --> 01:22:41.694
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1928
01:22:42.080 --> 01:22:44.280
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it funny that like the,</v>

1929
01:22:44.330 --> 01:22:48.260
<v Speaker 2>the most powerful military people are</v>
<v Speaker 2>still just vulnerable to the.</v>

1930
01:22:49.100 --> 01:22:49.491
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

1931
01:22:49.491 --> 01:22:53.470
<v Speaker 5>But here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He could have been at the Deq pillowtalk</v>

1932
01:22:53.480 --> 01:22:55.610
<v Speaker 5>Ya.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He could have been having an affair is</v>

1933
01:22:55.611 --> 01:22:57.410
<v Speaker 5>all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No one would have tried to stop him</v>

1934
01:22:57.411 --> 01:23:00.560
<v Speaker 5>because he's top of the military.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But once you started leaking the</v>

1935
01:23:00.561 --> 01:23:02.390
<v Speaker 5>information and things change.</v>

1936
01:23:02.490 --> 01:23:05.400
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was your opinion of that journalist</v>

1937
01:23:05.650 --> 01:23:10.650
<v Speaker 2>that wound up allegedly committing</v>
<v Speaker 2>suicide by driving his car head on into</v>

1938
01:23:11.201 --> 01:23:14.110
<v Speaker 2>a tree?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember Michael Hastings.</v>

1939
01:23:14.350 --> 01:23:15.220
<v Speaker 2>Hastings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1940
01:23:15.620 --> 01:23:19.330
<v Speaker 2>What did you think about it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that I think that there's a lot</v>

1941
01:23:19.331 --> 01:23:21.940
<v Speaker 2>of evidence that he was probably taken</v>
<v Speaker 2>out</v>

1942
01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:31.520
<v Speaker 8>because it's got the right doing this 19</v>
<v Speaker 8>late Harvey Oswald acted alone.</v>

1943
01:23:37.150 --> 01:23:38.680
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it is.</v>

1944
01:23:38.740 --> 01:23:41.680
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we know he emailed and by the way,</v>

1945
01:23:41.681 --> 01:23:43.750
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking sad and horrific weather</v>

1946
01:23:43.751 --> 01:23:45.120
<v Speaker 2>whether he was taken out or not taken</v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

1947
01:23:45.130 --> 01:23:46.610
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking horrific.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1948
01:23:46.630 --> 01:23:50.800
<v Speaker 2>because he was such an amazing reporter</v>
<v Speaker 2>and amazing ability did wrote the story</v>

1949
01:23:50.801 --> 01:23:54.010
<v Speaker 2>for Rolling Stones for rolling stone</v>
<v Speaker 2>about Petraeus and about some of those</v>

1950
01:23:54.011 --> 01:23:57.100
<v Speaker 2>guys was another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was actually another general two and</v>

1951
01:23:57.380 --> 01:23:59.530
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was something that the general,</v>

1952
01:23:59.531 --> 01:24:04.531
<v Speaker 2>it's said like in some way mocking the</v>
<v Speaker 2>president [inaudible] and he printed</v>

1953
01:24:05.081 --> 01:24:05.914
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1954
01:24:06.130 --> 01:24:09.760
<v Speaker 2>And it set off this whole chain of</v>
<v Speaker 2>events that guy went up stepping down</v>

1955
01:24:10.030 --> 01:24:14.890
<v Speaker 2>and people were furious at him for</v>
<v Speaker 2>making this guy stepped down when he was</v>

1956
01:24:14.891 --> 01:24:16.930
<v Speaker 2>embedded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was embedded for an extended period of</v>

1957
01:24:16.931 --> 01:24:19.600
<v Speaker 2>time because he was only supposed to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>there for a shorter amount of time.</v>

1958
01:24:19.601 --> 01:24:22.810
<v Speaker 2>And then he stayed for a longer time</v>
<v Speaker 2>because something had happened.</v>

1959
01:24:22.810 --> 01:24:24.550
<v Speaker 2>They couldn't get them out of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did the right thing,</v>

1960
01:24:24.551 --> 01:24:27.160
<v Speaker 2>which is you're not supposed to become</v>
<v Speaker 2>best buddies with these guys.</v>

1961
01:24:27.161 --> 01:24:29.500
<v Speaker 2>She was supposed to keep being a</v>
<v Speaker 2>legitimate reporter.</v>

1962
01:24:29.501 --> 01:24:31.060
<v Speaker 2>And most people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most people embedded,</v>

1963
01:24:31.061 --> 01:24:32.980
<v Speaker 2>don't they?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They become friends with them.</v>

1964
01:24:32.981 --> 01:24:34.210
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

1965
01:24:34.300 --> 01:24:37.470
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing a lot of people don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>know is he sent an email to buzz feed.</v>

1966
01:24:37.471 --> 01:24:38.770
<v Speaker 2>That's where he was working at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1967
01:24:39.010 --> 01:24:39.910
<v Speaker 2>Saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1968
01:24:39.911 --> 01:24:42.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm onto something pig.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to.</v>

1969
01:24:42.090 --> 01:24:45.880
<v Speaker 2>Might not hear from me for awhile if the</v>
<v Speaker 2>FBI shows up to the offices,</v>

1970
01:24:46.150 --> 01:24:48.790
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell them you need a lawyer and don't</v>

1971
01:24:48.791 --> 01:24:52.840
<v Speaker 2>talk to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that email goes out like it's like 24</v>

1972
01:24:52.841 --> 01:24:57.730
<v Speaker 2>hours or something before his car</v>
<v Speaker 2>explodes in a fiery mass here in la.</v>

1973
01:24:58.060 --> 01:24:59.870
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1974
01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.700
<v Speaker 2>it seems like they definitely could have</v>
<v Speaker 2>been hacking of the,</v>

1975
01:25:02.730 --> 01:25:04.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's going 100 miles an hour now.</v>

1976
01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:06.960
<v Speaker 2>I've also heard some people saying he</v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

1977
01:25:06.990 --> 01:25:08.910
<v Speaker 2>he was into some wild stuff and while</v>
<v Speaker 2>driving,</v>

1978
01:25:08.911 --> 01:25:10.530
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will they,</v>

1979
01:25:10.531 --> 01:25:13.050
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they definitely found methodist system</v>

1980
01:25:13.051 --> 01:25:16.140
<v Speaker 2>allegedly according to the coroner who</v>
<v Speaker 2>was absolutely not paid off,</v>

1981
01:25:16.650 --> 01:25:17.820
<v Speaker 2>he asked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you read,</v>

1982
01:25:17.821 --> 01:25:21.480
<v Speaker 2>if you read the full coroner's report,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it says not at a level that would have</v>

1983
01:25:21.481 --> 01:25:25.440
<v Speaker 2>impaired driving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a trace of some stuff of math.</v>

1984
01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:27.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what I was going to say was that,</v>

1985
01:25:27.930 --> 01:25:29.640
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

1986
01:25:29.880 --> 01:25:32.910
<v Speaker 2>correct me if I'm wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if you take adderall,</v>

1987
01:25:33.090 --> 01:25:37.140
<v Speaker 2>he took a lot of adderall in particular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that has almost exact same</v>

1988
01:25:37.141 --> 01:25:39.060
<v Speaker 2>chemicals as math.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1989
01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:42.780
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't you test positive for meth if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were taking a lot of adderall?</v>

1990
01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:43.710
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a good question.</v>

1991
01:25:43.711 --> 01:25:45.030
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Please look that up.</v>

1992
01:25:45.031 --> 01:25:46.320
<v Speaker 2>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think,</v>

1993
01:25:46.321 --> 01:25:47.430
<v Speaker 2>what do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's just guess.</v>

1994
01:25:47.431 --> 01:25:50.450
<v Speaker 2>Let's play</v>
<v Speaker 2>test positive for meth.</v>

1995
01:25:50.451 --> 01:25:53.490
<v Speaker 2>If you're taken adderall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that you could test positive for</v>

1996
01:25:53.491 --> 01:25:56.220
<v Speaker 2>meth if there's probably certain certain</v>
<v Speaker 2>other chemicals in your system.</v>

1997
01:25:56.221 --> 01:25:59.790
<v Speaker 2>The unrelated to math,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the urinalysis test for any and all</v>

1998
01:25:59.791 --> 01:26:03.440
<v Speaker 2>amphetamines and methamphetamines is</v>
<v Speaker 2>just one derivative.</v>

1999
01:26:03.441 --> 01:26:04.130
<v Speaker 2>Similarly,</v>

2000
01:26:04.130 --> 01:26:08.270
<v Speaker 4>adderall is a combination drug comprise</v>
<v Speaker 4>of two amphetamine salts,</v>

2001
01:26:08.870 --> 01:26:10.940
<v Speaker 4>Dextro,</v>
<v Speaker 4>amphetamine,</v>

2002
01:26:10.970 --> 01:26:15.970
<v Speaker 4>and level amphetamine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Any of the three will show positive for</v>

2003
01:26:16.221 --> 01:26:20.270
<v Speaker 4>amphetamines in a urine drug test,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they all get on well done.</v>

2004
01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:21.840
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Joe Rogan,</v>

2005
01:26:21.860 --> 01:26:24.950
<v Speaker 4>everybody adderalls math,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so he could have been just taken</v>

2006
01:26:24.951 --> 01:26:27.140
<v Speaker 4>adderall,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is super common amongst writers.</v>

2007
01:26:27.141 --> 01:26:29.000
<v Speaker 4>When you have a deadline you have to</v>
<v Speaker 4>bang out something.</v>

2008
01:26:29.001 --> 01:26:32.210
<v Speaker 4>You're exhausted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it is almost mandatory amongst a</v>

2009
01:26:32.211 --> 01:26:33.150
<v Speaker 4>lot of writers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2010
01:26:33.350 --> 01:26:34.183
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But so,</v>

2011
01:26:34.220 --> 01:26:36.800
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and even so it's like trace amounts</v>

2012
01:26:36.830 --> 01:26:40.580
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't have impaired driving and he's</v>
<v Speaker 4>going 100 miles an hour and these cars</v>

2013
01:26:40.581 --> 01:26:42.500
<v Speaker 4>are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the car he was in was,</v>

2014
01:26:42.501 --> 01:26:44.300
<v Speaker 4>had a hackable computer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

2015
01:26:44.540 --> 01:26:47.600
<v Speaker 4>Well they can do it now for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's what we're talking about</v>

2016
01:26:47.601 --> 01:26:49.160
<v Speaker 4>previously.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All these autonomous cars,</v>

2017
01:26:49.161 --> 01:26:53.090
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of cars now like the Tesla</v>
<v Speaker 4>where you can get on the road and you</v>

2018
01:26:53.091 --> 01:26:55.550
<v Speaker 4>could press a button and take your</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking hands off the wheel.</v>

2019
01:26:55.640 --> 01:26:58.310
<v Speaker 4>And the navigation system drives the car</v>
<v Speaker 4>100 percent.</v>

2020
01:26:58.311 --> 01:27:02.660
<v Speaker 4>My buddy texted me from his fucking car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like sitting there texting me while</v>

2021
01:27:02.661 --> 01:27:05.990
<v Speaker 4>he's driving.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this is a car right now today that</v>

2022
01:27:05.991 --> 01:27:07.130
<v Speaker 4>can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you,</v>

2023
01:27:07.190 --> 01:27:10.040
<v Speaker 4>if there is no requirement that you keep</v>
<v Speaker 4>looking at the road,</v>

2024
01:27:10.520 --> 01:27:13.070
<v Speaker 4>well you're supposed to actually have</v>
<v Speaker 4>your hands on the wheel,</v>

2025
01:27:13.340 --> 01:27:16.940
<v Speaker 4>but you don't have to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The BMW seven series apparently has a</v>

2026
01:27:16.941 --> 01:27:20.270
<v Speaker 4>very similar technology,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you have to hold onto the wheel.</v>

2027
01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:22.610
<v Speaker 4>Like it'll do all the driving.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'll do all the breaking.</v>

2028
01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:24.950
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of acceleration,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it wants your hands on the wheel</v>

2029
01:27:24.951 --> 01:27:28.220
<v Speaker 4>just in case some shit goes down like</v>
<v Speaker 4>please pay attention as much as</v>

2030
01:27:28.220 --> 01:27:29.630
<v Speaker 4>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're gonna make it as safe as possible.</v>

2031
01:27:29.750 --> 01:27:31.850
<v Speaker 4>We're going to do all the work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but right here at 10 and two,</v>

2032
01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:34.120
<v Speaker 4>10 to buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wonder who do.</v>

2033
01:27:34.150 --> 01:27:38.120
<v Speaker 4>Does the human or the computer when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if like you were accelerating into a</v>

2034
01:27:38.121 --> 01:27:41.540
<v Speaker 4>tree with the computer stuff or would it</v>
<v Speaker 4>just be like,</v>

2035
01:27:41.541 --> 01:27:42.870
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a very good question.</v>

2036
01:27:42.871 --> 01:27:44.030
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a very good question.</v>

2037
01:27:44.031 --> 01:27:45.710
<v Speaker 4>Humans got it covered.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2038
01:27:45.711 --> 01:27:47.000
<v Speaker 4>that's a very good question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2039
01:27:47.001 --> 01:27:50.300
<v Speaker 4>This guy's trying to commit a homicide.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There isn't a question,</v>

2040
01:27:50.301 --> 01:27:52.760
<v Speaker 4>but what happened if there's like people</v>
<v Speaker 4>crossing the street with the car hit the</v>

2041
01:27:52.761 --> 01:27:54.290
<v Speaker 4>people are safe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The people in the car,</v>

2042
01:27:54.620 --> 01:27:57.250
<v Speaker 4>which is almost a better question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a very good question.</v>

2043
01:27:57.260 --> 01:28:00.080
<v Speaker 4>A moral judgment calls like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do you do if an animal runs in</v>

2044
01:28:00.081 --> 01:28:01.610
<v Speaker 4>front of your car?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What does the car do?</v>

2045
01:28:01.780 --> 01:28:04.190
<v Speaker 4>Because the car looking at these trees</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the right trees,</v>

2046
01:28:04.191 --> 01:28:06.860
<v Speaker 4>to the left and an animal runs in front</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the car.</v>

2047
01:28:06.861 --> 01:28:08.750
<v Speaker 4>What do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well and if it slams on the brakes,</v>

2048
01:28:08.780 --> 01:28:10.170
<v Speaker 4>the guy behind you could plow into you.</v>

2049
01:28:10.910 --> 01:28:13.340
<v Speaker 4>Maybe if it's like maybe there's a size</v>
<v Speaker 4>limit,</v>

2050
01:28:13.341 --> 01:28:17.990
<v Speaker 4>like if it's a rat you just kill it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if it's a dog slam on the brakes,</v>

2051
01:28:18.020 --> 01:28:19.870
<v Speaker 4>maybe don't want anybody to lose their</v>
<v Speaker 4>dog.</v>

2052
01:28:19.871 --> 01:28:21.260
<v Speaker 4>Has a cuteness test.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2053
01:28:21.261 --> 01:28:22.370
<v Speaker 4>Or the animal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2054
01:28:22.371 --> 01:28:24.680
<v Speaker 4>Like if it's a rat you kill it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if it's a squirrel you tried to</v>

2055
01:28:24.681 --> 01:28:26.450
<v Speaker 4>swerve,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're really sad.</v>

2056
01:28:26.451 --> 01:28:28.430
<v Speaker 4>If you hit a button,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2057
01:28:29.620 --> 01:28:30.890
<v Speaker 4>If it's a deer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck it.</v>

2058
01:28:30.920 --> 01:28:33.830
<v Speaker 4>But if it's a bunny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously that one word guy hits a bear</v>

2059
01:28:33.930 --> 01:28:36.340
<v Speaker 4>was going like 60 miles an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That one,</v>

2060
01:28:36.710 --> 01:28:40.490
<v Speaker 4>the really recent one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This guy is driving and he's talking.</v>

2061
01:28:40.491 --> 01:28:42.500
<v Speaker 4>I think he's talking about getting baked</v>
<v Speaker 4>too,</v>

2062
01:28:42.501 --> 01:28:46.760
<v Speaker 4>which is really funny and this fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>bear just jumps out of nowhere.</v>

2063
01:28:46.761 --> 01:28:50.270
<v Speaker 4>I really think he was talking about</v>
<v Speaker 4>getting high while it happened.</v>

2064
01:28:51.110 --> 01:28:54.920
<v Speaker 4>So this guy's drive and he's</v>
<v Speaker 4>accelerating and as he's driving down</v>

2065
01:28:54.921 --> 01:28:56.960
<v Speaker 4>the road,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this bear just jumps in front of his</v>

2066
01:28:56.961 --> 01:28:59.870
<v Speaker 4>car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He slams into the bear and the bear</v>

2067
01:28:59.871 --> 01:29:01.950
<v Speaker 4>literally goes launching the air.</v>

2068
01:29:02.610 --> 01:29:04.810
<v Speaker 2>And then the bear gets up and runs off</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the woods.</v>

2069
01:29:04.811 --> 01:29:07.260
<v Speaker 2>So there was fine dude that probably</v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

2070
01:29:07.430 --> 01:29:09.600
<v Speaker 2>probably had massive internal injuries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Watch this.</v>

2071
01:29:09.601 --> 01:29:11.380
<v Speaker 2>Here it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

2072
01:29:12.710 --> 01:29:14.180
<v Speaker 2>hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me give me the full volume.</v>

2073
01:29:15.020 --> 01:29:17.180
<v Speaker 2>Do it from the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>

2074
01:29:17.181 --> 01:29:20.360
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to go home and smoke a fucking</v>

2075
01:29:20.361 --> 01:29:25.361
<v Speaker 2>huge fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's talking about getting baked shit</v>

2076
01:29:27.081 --> 01:29:30.490
<v Speaker 2>out of a fucking bear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he just slammed into this bear dude.</v>

2077
01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:31.750
<v Speaker 2>The bears.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2078
01:29:31.770 --> 01:29:32.170
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2079
01:29:32.170 --> 01:29:36.080
<v Speaker 2>That Paris dead</v>
<v Speaker 2>hobbled off,</v>

2080
01:29:36.081 --> 01:29:38.540
<v Speaker 2>but it's going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure it's going to die.</v>

2081
01:29:38.750 --> 01:29:41.670
<v Speaker 2>That the impact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Watching one more time because I enjoy</v>

2082
01:29:41.671 --> 01:29:42.920
<v Speaker 2>these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One more time.</v>

2083
01:29:42.940 --> 01:29:44.600
<v Speaker 2>Why should more volume?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Please</v>

2084
01:29:49.480 --> 01:29:53.840
<v Speaker 2>do that as not a financial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no way that animals find bears</v>

2085
01:29:53.841 --> 01:29:55.880
<v Speaker 2>are pretty tough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty tough.</v>

2086
01:29:55.940 --> 01:29:59.000
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine that thing's dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine you're dealing with</v>

2087
01:29:59.001 --> 01:30:02.570
<v Speaker 2>massive internal hemorrhages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just slammed into that thing and went</v>

2088
01:30:02.571 --> 01:30:03.261
<v Speaker 2>flat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2089
01:30:03.261 --> 01:30:05.210
<v Speaker 2>how many feet do you think it went?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's see.</v>

2090
01:30:05.211 --> 01:30:06.021
<v Speaker 2>The impact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One more time.</v>

2091
01:30:06.021 --> 01:30:08.600
<v Speaker 2>Please do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just really roll one more time.</v>

2092
01:30:11.680 --> 01:30:15.200
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing that I can walk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It hits the ground.</v>

2093
01:30:15.640 --> 01:30:18.410
<v Speaker 2>It gets up and starts hobbling off into</v>
<v Speaker 2>the woods.</v>

2094
01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.280
<v Speaker 2>You're going to make this your ringtone</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you know,</v>

2095
01:30:21.940 --> 01:30:23.350
<v Speaker 2>let's go champ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's go chat.</v>

2096
01:30:23.351 --> 01:30:25.390
<v Speaker 2>Inspiring toe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

2097
01:30:25.630 --> 01:30:28.280
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go home and smoke it.</v>

2098
01:30:30.100 --> 01:30:35.100
<v Speaker 2>But that is obviously in the animal that</v>
<v Speaker 2>your car would stop for so big ass</v>

2099
01:30:35.681 --> 01:30:38.480
<v Speaker 2>animals and does it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the coach just assumes there's no Mac</v>

2100
01:30:38.500 --> 01:30:41.270
<v Speaker 2>truck behind you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just gonna drive over to.</v>

2101
01:30:41.290 --> 01:30:43.240
<v Speaker 2>Very good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very good question.</v>

2102
01:30:43.410 --> 01:30:45.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that doesn't make judgment calls</v>

2103
01:30:46.150 --> 01:30:49.390
<v Speaker 2>and you could make the wrong one and</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe its calculations will be more</v>

2104
01:30:49.391 --> 01:30:52.240
<v Speaker 2>accurate than yours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but maybe it'll just be going slower in</v>

2105
01:30:52.241 --> 01:30:54.730
<v Speaker 2>the first place so that it won't be as</v>
<v Speaker 2>much of an issue.</v>

2106
01:30:54.760 --> 01:30:56.500
<v Speaker 2>So it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if these cars are going the speed limit,</v>

2107
01:30:56.501 --> 01:30:57.430
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to lose my shit.</v>

2108
01:30:57.480 --> 01:31:00.610
<v Speaker 2>Like if that guy was going exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was driving down the road and he was</v>

2109
01:31:00.611 --> 01:31:03.850
<v Speaker 2>going 10 miles an hour slower.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He might've been able to slam on the</v>

2110
01:31:03.851 --> 01:31:07.090
<v Speaker 2>brakes and avoid that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're showing you yesterday.</v>

2111
01:31:07.091 --> 01:31:08.770
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I thought it was going around</v>

2112
01:31:08.771 --> 01:31:11.530
<v Speaker 2>because it was new.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this Tesla slams into the back of</v>

2113
01:31:11.531 --> 01:31:12.760
<v Speaker 2>this van.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>

2114
01:31:12.761 --> 01:31:14.800
<v Speaker 2>See at the last second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because that car.</v>

2115
01:31:15.190 --> 01:31:20.190
<v Speaker 2>Oh well I guess there's some verbiage in</v>
<v Speaker 2>that autonomous driving that it may not</v>

2116
01:31:20.651 --> 01:31:22.900
<v Speaker 2>see parked vehicles on highways or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

2117
01:31:22.930 --> 01:31:25.420
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like if you're going 60 miles an</v>

2118
01:31:25.421 --> 01:31:28.180
<v Speaker 2>hour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was the computers were watching</v>

2119
01:31:28.181 --> 01:31:32.260
<v Speaker 2>the moving car and ignored the stuffed</v>
<v Speaker 2>time to see it or recognize.</v>

2120
01:31:32.261 --> 01:31:33.870
<v Speaker 2>So there's a bunch of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know what?</v>

2121
01:31:34.060 --> 01:31:36.040
<v Speaker 2>That's to be expected with some new</v>
<v Speaker 2>technology.</v>

2122
01:31:36.041 --> 01:31:39.220
<v Speaker 2>There's no way it's going to come out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bat and it's going to be out of the</v>

2123
01:31:39.221 --> 01:31:41.420
<v Speaker 2>bat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bat,</v>

2124
01:31:42.110 --> 01:31:44.770
<v Speaker 2>bat out of the barn with this Goddamn</v>
<v Speaker 2>hyperloop.</v>

2125
01:31:44.830 --> 01:31:46.570
<v Speaker 2>I got questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Elon Musk.</v>

2126
01:31:46.600 --> 01:31:49.120
<v Speaker 2>I know nothing about the hyperloop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's putting a Goddamn.</v>

2127
01:31:49.210 --> 01:31:52.090
<v Speaker 2>It goes as fast as a jet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's on the ground.</v>

2128
01:31:52.440 --> 01:31:57.340
<v Speaker 2>Just put putting the Goddamn ground jet</v>
<v Speaker 2>and jet to ground isn't around yet,</v>

2129
01:31:57.450 --> 01:31:59.620
<v Speaker 2>but he's living in his goddamn yet</v>

2130
01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:04.600
<v Speaker 4>putting it in our sacred land.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why is there not a bullet train across</v>

2131
01:32:04.601 --> 01:32:06.220
<v Speaker 4>to us though?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because that to me,</v>

2132
01:32:06.221 --> 01:32:09.340
<v Speaker 4>because people can just decide.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She just wants them to jump in front of</v>

2133
01:32:09.341 --> 01:32:11.840
<v Speaker 4>the bullet train and that's like having</v>
<v Speaker 4>a.</v>

2134
01:32:11.890 --> 01:32:13.330
<v Speaker 4>If you were at a plane,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

2135
01:32:13.331 --> 01:32:16.000
<v Speaker 4>If how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how much more dangerous would air flight</v>

2136
01:32:16.001 --> 01:32:20.170
<v Speaker 4>be if any asshole at any point in time</v>
<v Speaker 4>could instantly put a telephone pole up</v>

2137
01:32:20.171 --> 01:32:24.770
<v Speaker 4>right in front of the plane</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I'm traveling or a bear plane.</v>

2138
01:32:24.771 --> 01:32:29.260
<v Speaker 4>Travel or</v>
<v Speaker 4>travel would be so much more fucking</v>

2139
01:32:29.261 --> 01:32:30.220
<v Speaker 4>dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2140
01:32:30.370 --> 01:32:32.260
<v Speaker 4>If anybody could just randomly decided</v>
<v Speaker 4>we.</v>

2141
01:32:32.261 --> 01:32:35.950
<v Speaker 4>Most people wouldn't ask,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if they decided to trains out of the</v>

2142
01:32:35.951 --> 01:32:38.230
<v Speaker 4>cow catchers and knock the cows out of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way.</v>

2143
01:32:38.410 --> 01:32:40.360
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but does that always work?</v>

2144
01:32:41.100 --> 01:32:42.940
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of shit you could put on</v>

2145
01:32:42.941 --> 01:32:44.590
<v Speaker 4>the track.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The train couldn't just knock out of the</v>

2146
01:32:44.591 --> 01:32:44.830
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>

2147
01:32:44.830 --> 01:32:48.630
<v Speaker 4>You can move some boulders in place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He could put some explosives and some</v>

2148
01:32:48.640 --> 01:32:50.460
<v Speaker 4>boulders,</v>
<v Speaker 4>boulders.</v>

2149
01:32:50.640 --> 01:32:54.910
<v Speaker 4>Fuck La Cena guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He puts the dynamite in the hale and he</v>

2150
01:32:54.940 --> 01:32:55.930
<v Speaker 4>times it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2151
01:32:56.090 --> 01:32:57.760
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dave [inaudible] for sure can stick</v>

2152
01:32:57.761 --> 01:32:59.800
<v Speaker 4>something in front of that train.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That sucks if you hit it,</v>

2153
01:33:00.160 --> 01:33:02.620
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some sort of a bomb type situation.</v>

2154
01:33:02.740 --> 01:33:04.060
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's essentially what are you going do</v>

2155
01:33:04.061 --> 01:33:08.350
<v Speaker 4>you have TSA agents every 50 feet across</v>
<v Speaker 4>the United States to damn Amtrak goes</v>

2156
01:33:08.351 --> 01:33:09.640
<v Speaker 4>along.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody's trying to stop them.</v>

2157
01:33:09.880 --> 01:33:14.830
<v Speaker 4>Rosary in their hand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>glassy eyed Zombie look leaps off the</v>

2158
01:33:14.831 --> 01:33:16.000
<v Speaker 4>top,</v>
<v Speaker 4>boom.</v>

2159
01:33:16.001 --> 01:33:18.400
<v Speaker 4>It hits the window and you can get them</v>
<v Speaker 4>on all sides.</v>

2160
01:33:18.401 --> 01:33:20.700
<v Speaker 4>They could just jump in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Still I.</v>

2161
01:33:20.700 --> 01:33:23.200
<v Speaker 4>It's worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it works for a month and then you</v>

2162
01:33:23.290 --> 01:33:26.500
<v Speaker 4>plaster a couple of guys and it works</v>
<v Speaker 4>for another month before you put it all</v>

2163
01:33:26.501 --> 01:33:29.230
<v Speaker 4>into ground and starts earthquakes</v>
<v Speaker 4>quicker than fracking.</v>

2164
01:33:29.800 --> 01:33:31.990
<v Speaker 4>That's the other thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They we're going to do one up to San</v>

2165
01:33:31.990 --> 01:33:32.501
<v Speaker 4>Francisco.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How about that?</v>

2166
01:33:32.501 --> 01:33:35.560
<v Speaker 4>Going 700 miles an hour on the ground</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the fucking earth moves.</v>

2167
01:33:36.070 --> 01:33:37.030
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How about that?</v>

2168
01:33:37.060 --> 01:33:39.160
<v Speaker 4>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I Dunno how La has a metro.</v>

2169
01:33:39.250 --> 01:33:42.010
<v Speaker 4>I don't really get how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What didn't that thing gonna collapse in</v>

2170
01:33:42.030 --> 01:33:44.110
<v Speaker 4>the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing really well built,</v>

2171
01:33:44.590 --> 01:33:48.940
<v Speaker 4>but San Francisco goes one better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have the bart system which goes</v>

2172
01:33:48.941 --> 01:33:51.970
<v Speaker 4>under the funk and old.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was it?</v>

2173
01:33:52.300 --> 01:33:56.980
<v Speaker 4>That's it goes onto the bay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is this know how I found out I was high</v>

2174
01:33:56.981 --> 01:34:00.430
<v Speaker 4>as fuck and I was hanging out with the</v>
<v Speaker 4>crew at fear factor and we decided to</v>

2175

<v Speaker 4>go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're filming in Oakland.</v>

2176
01:34:01.631 --> 01:34:03.400
<v Speaker 4>We decided to go for dinner in San</v>
<v Speaker 4>Francisco.</v>

2177
01:34:03.401 --> 01:34:05.560
<v Speaker 4>So we all got together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We got on this train and I'm like,</v>

2178
01:34:05.561 --> 01:34:08.620
<v Speaker 4>why my ears popping and they go</v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] we're underneath the bay.</v>

2179
01:34:08.710 --> 01:34:09.820
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2180
01:34:12.430 --> 01:34:15.100
<v Speaker 4>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Underneath Alcatraz.</v>

2181
01:34:15.120 --> 01:34:19.930
<v Speaker 4>I was already super paranoid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was already super duper high on</v>

2182
01:34:19.931 --> 01:34:23.320
<v Speaker 4>edibles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it was like the worst time to</v>

2183
01:34:23.321 --> 01:34:26.100
<v Speaker 4>underestimate the power of vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was under the water.</v>

2184
01:34:26.210 --> 01:34:30.700
<v Speaker 4>That's feeling my ears pop</v>
<v Speaker 4>was a real moment where I came</v>

2185
01:34:30.701 --> 01:34:31.900
<v Speaker 4>downstairs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is,</v>

2186
01:34:32.230 --> 01:34:35.470
<v Speaker 4>I came downstairs from my hotel room and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I met all my friends in the lobby and I</v>

2187
01:34:35.471 --> 01:34:40.471
<v Speaker 4>was just so beyond barbecued that I had</v>
<v Speaker 4>this illusion,</v>

2188
01:34:41.110 --> 01:34:45.730
<v Speaker 4>this a hallucination of people being</v>
<v Speaker 4>this two dimensional,</v>

2189
01:34:45.731 --> 01:34:47.460
<v Speaker 4>like cut out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like say like,</v>

2190
01:34:47.500 --> 01:34:51.470
<v Speaker 4>like those a preview things that you see</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the movies we see like a,</v>

2191
01:34:51.650 --> 01:34:54.150
<v Speaker 4>a two dimensional cutout of an action</v>
<v Speaker 4>figure.</v>

2192
01:34:54.440 --> 01:34:57.190
<v Speaker 4>That's what people were.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then behind that I would see peeking</v>

2193
01:34:57.200 --> 01:34:58.220
<v Speaker 4>out their true self.</v>

2194
01:34:58.220 --> 01:34:59.450
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh shit.</v>

2195
01:35:00.110 --> 01:35:02.090
<v Speaker 2>It was like poking out from behind</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

2196
01:35:02.091 --> 01:35:04.400
<v Speaker 2>I would sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is you don't know which one</v>

2197
01:35:04.401 --> 01:35:06.110
<v Speaker 2>to punch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which one do you punch where all my</v>

2198
01:35:06.111 --> 01:35:07.650
<v Speaker 2>friends just want to punch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just like,</v>

2199
01:35:07.800 --> 01:35:11.810
<v Speaker 2>are you really taking me or am I ears</v>
<v Speaker 2>popping?</v>

2200
01:35:13.160 --> 01:35:15.440
<v Speaker 2>That thing moves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The ground moves there and they're under</v>

2201
01:35:15.441 --> 01:35:17.300
<v Speaker 2>the goddamn ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>San Francisco is.</v>

2202
01:35:17.330 --> 01:35:21.260
<v Speaker 2>It's built unlike mud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's filled with sharks,</v>

2203
01:35:21.530 --> 01:35:23.750
<v Speaker 2>surrounded by sharks and the ground</v>
<v Speaker 2>moves.</v>

2204
01:35:23.780 --> 01:35:25.660
<v Speaker 2>It's trying to kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sharks are walking down the street,</v>

2205
01:35:25.661 --> 01:35:29.450
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's trying to kill you.</v>

2206
01:35:30.260 --> 01:35:32.680
<v Speaker 2>A lot of mountain lions up there too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2207
01:35:32.690 --> 01:35:34.460
<v Speaker 2>they eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dogs are dogs and cats.</v>

2208
01:35:34.650 --> 01:35:35.990
<v Speaker 2>They.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They catch what?</v>

2209
01:35:36.620 --> 01:35:37.820
<v Speaker 2>Good for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say,</v>

2210
01:35:38.480 --> 01:35:41.390
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of nature needs to fucking be</v>

2211
01:35:41.391 --> 01:35:43.020
<v Speaker 2>winning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of nature needs three.</v>

2212
01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:44.210
<v Speaker 2>Winning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's great.</v>

2213
01:35:44.240 --> 01:35:46.970
<v Speaker 2>Not on my watch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it should eat a bunch of</v>

2214
01:35:46.971 --> 01:35:47.804
<v Speaker 2>poodles.</v>

2215
01:35:47.930 --> 01:35:49.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But occasionally we'll get your</v>

2216
01:35:49.221 --> 01:35:50.330
<v Speaker 2>girlfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2217
01:35:50.340 --> 01:35:51.410
<v Speaker 2>that's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2218
01:35:52.010 --> 01:35:54.590
<v Speaker 2>Joggers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they like to go off to joggers.</v>

2219
01:35:54.770 --> 01:35:56.930
<v Speaker 2>Buyers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember it was hiking once and I saw</v>

2220
01:35:56.931 --> 01:36:00.710
<v Speaker 2>a sign would be where of mountain lions</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the the advice on the sign was throw</v>

2221
01:36:00.711 --> 01:36:03.200
<v Speaker 2>sticks and rocks at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not if you have to bend down to get</v>

2222
01:36:03.201 --> 01:36:03.981
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2223
01:36:03.981 --> 01:36:06.560
<v Speaker 2>what are you walking around with?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bundles of sticks and rocks.</v>

01:36:06.890 --> 01:36:07.940
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He talking about.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you got to be careful because you,</v>

2226
01:36:09.570 --> 01:36:11.180
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to be scary,</v>

2227
01:36:11.181 --> 01:36:14.690
<v Speaker 2>but you don't want to be challenging.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very tricky fucking dance.</v>

2228
01:36:14.710 --> 01:36:17.900
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it attacks fight back.</v>

2229
01:36:18.230 --> 01:36:19.730
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

2230
01:36:20.100 --> 01:36:22.190
<v Speaker 2>There was a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw signed recently when I was up in</v>

2231
01:36:22.191 --> 01:36:24.500
<v Speaker 2>San Francisco.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I put it up on my instagram that that</v>

2232
01:36:24.501 --> 01:36:26.810
<v Speaker 2>was the very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the very advice that if you see a</v>

2233
01:36:26.811 --> 01:36:28.400
<v Speaker 2>mountain lion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a mountain lion attacks,</v>

2234
01:36:28.401 --> 01:36:29.990
<v Speaker 2>you fight back like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>

2235
01:36:30.490 --> 01:36:31.160
<v Speaker 2>do you have.</v>

<v Speaker 2>how much you'd get laid if you won that</v>

2238
01:36:36.741 --> 01:36:39.080
<v Speaker 2>fight though?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's student candidate killed him</v>

2239
01:36:39.081 --> 01:36:40.400
<v Speaker 2>with the knife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was in his sixties.</v>

2240
01:36:40.940 --> 01:36:43.200
<v Speaker 2>Mountain lion jumped him and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck,</v>

<v Speaker 2>That guy's been waiting his whole life</v>

2242
01:36:48.621 --> 01:36:51.500
<v Speaker 2>for that moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it was just a man.</v>

2243
01:36:52.380 --> 01:36:57.290
<v Speaker 2>It's the man with a knife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe other giant ass fucking crocodile</v>

2244
01:36:57.291 --> 01:36:58.730
<v Speaker 2>dundee knife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was</v>

2245
01:37:00.900 --> 01:37:04.370
<v Speaker 2>just the idea that we're supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>just let those things run around.</v>

2246
01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:07.220
<v Speaker 2>There's a big protest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nature shouldn't be winning in some ways</v>

2247
01:37:07.450 --> 01:37:10.310
<v Speaker 2>of eating some eating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some dogs you.</v>

2248
01:37:10.680 --> 01:37:13.430
<v Speaker 2>They dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dogs out here,</v>

2249
01:37:13.431 --> 01:37:14.930
<v Speaker 2>so they do occasionally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2250
01:37:14.960 --> 01:37:16.940
<v Speaker 2>they definitely little dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's interesting.</v>

2251
01:37:17.010 --> 01:37:20.150
<v Speaker 2>There's been reading this book forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I swear I'll get it done soon.</v>

2252
01:37:20.151 --> 01:37:24.290
<v Speaker 2>Folks is a Dan Flores book called a</v>
<v Speaker 2>Coyote America.</v>

2253
01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:25.940
<v Speaker 2>It's actually about a history of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>coyotes.</v>

2254
01:37:26.120 --> 01:37:26.750
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

2255
01:37:26.750 --> 01:37:31.730
<v Speaker 2>he's arguing or he's saying that most of</v>
<v Speaker 2>what goes on when coyotes kill cats and</v>

2256
01:37:31.731 --> 01:37:32.570
<v Speaker 2>dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're cute.</v>

2257
01:37:32.630 --> 01:37:35.330
<v Speaker 2>They're killing competing predators.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how they look at it.</v>

2258
01:37:35.360 --> 01:37:36.770
<v Speaker 2>Like they're going to eat the cat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dog,</v>

2259
01:37:36.920 --> 01:37:39.560
<v Speaker 2>but really what's going on as they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're killing the competitor not doing</v>

2260
01:37:39.580 --> 01:37:40.281
<v Speaker 2>food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2261
01:37:40.281 --> 01:37:42.680
<v Speaker 2>cats kill an exorbitant amount of</v>
<v Speaker 2>animals.</v>

2262
01:37:43.080 --> 01:37:44.090
<v Speaker 2>You probably know about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2263
01:37:44.270 --> 01:37:48.170
<v Speaker 2>Tons of number one killer of birds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think his cats in America.</v>

2264
01:37:48.350 --> 01:37:49.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>feral cats are.</v>

2265
01:37:50.030 --> 01:37:55.030
<v Speaker 2>They just don't kill just a little.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They kill billions of mammals and B I</v>

2266
01:37:56.550 --> 01:37:57.960
<v Speaker 4>and people like there's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2267
01:37:57.961 --> 01:38:01.740
<v Speaker 4>There was a whole article about how</v>
<v Speaker 4>these scientists did this longterm study</v>

2268
01:38:01.980 --> 01:38:04.710
<v Speaker 4>and it blew them away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They had literally had no one.</v>

2269
01:38:04.740 --> 01:38:07.740
<v Speaker 4>Once they start doing the calculations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like how many cats there are,</v>

2270
01:38:07.741 --> 01:38:10.710
<v Speaker 4>how many animals have cat is capable of</v>
<v Speaker 4>killing the cats outside.</v>

2271
01:38:10.890 --> 01:38:13.100
<v Speaker 4>How many animals will encounter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2272
01:38:13.110 --> 01:38:14.740
<v Speaker 4>and that's why it's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you know,</v>

2273
01:38:14.760 --> 01:38:16.500
<v Speaker 4>anti environmentalists are like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2274
01:38:16.501 --> 01:38:20.420
<v Speaker 4>the solar panel system is frying birds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fries.</v>

2275
01:38:20.500 --> 01:38:23.880
<v Speaker 4>A minimal number of birds compared to</v>
<v Speaker 4>the number of cats are taken out.</v>

2276
01:38:24.610 --> 01:38:26.040
<v Speaker 4>Jack and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>

2277
01:38:26.210 --> 01:38:29.880
<v Speaker 4>Cats are just monsters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There really are.</v>

2278
01:38:30.030 --> 01:38:33.420
<v Speaker 4>I also read that if you die in your</v>
<v Speaker 4>apartment dogs,</v>

2279
01:38:33.421 --> 01:38:35.790
<v Speaker 4>we'll leave you alone because they your</v>
<v Speaker 4>face,</v>

2280
01:38:35.910 --> 01:38:38.100
<v Speaker 4>they start with your lips,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but dogs are dogs.</v>

2281
01:38:38.101 --> 01:38:39.090
<v Speaker 4>Olivia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2282
01:38:39.110 --> 01:38:41.720
<v Speaker 4>that's cat's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thin again,</v>

2283
01:38:41.730 --> 01:38:43.500
<v Speaker 4>I love cats.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they're cool as fuck,</v>

2284
01:38:43.590 --> 01:38:45.420
<v Speaker 4>but they just designed by nature.</v>

2285
01:38:45.420 --> 01:38:48.450
<v Speaker 4>There's a whole system and cats are at</v>
<v Speaker 4>the top of the system.</v>

2286
01:38:48.480 --> 01:38:52.470
<v Speaker 4>The biggest ones are like you ever seen</v>
<v Speaker 4>that video of the crocodile coming out</v>

2287
01:38:52.471 --> 01:38:55.980
<v Speaker 4>of the water with its mouth open and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>lion goes in the water and stairs it</v>

2288
01:38:55.981 --> 01:38:58.620
<v Speaker 4>down and the crocodiles like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck this.</v>

2289
01:38:59.250 --> 01:39:04.200
<v Speaker 4>A crocodile backed off from alliance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's another video of a regular cat</v>

2290
01:39:04.590 --> 01:39:06.660
<v Speaker 4>getting a crocodile or alligator to back</v>
<v Speaker 4>down,</v>

2291

<v Speaker 4>the cat hisses and slaps the bear in the</v>

<v Speaker 4>but it's specific one.</v>

<v Speaker 4>teeth.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Like 12 animals or something crazy like</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Pee Forty five suspected of killing 11.</v>

2315
01:40:09.691 --> 01:40:12.550
<v Speaker 4>ALPAC is in a goat cheese.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just,</v>

2316
01:40:12.660 --> 01:40:15.800
<v Speaker 4>and he's not doing it is in two days.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just,</v>

2317
01:40:15.810 --> 01:40:18.090
<v Speaker 4>in two days he's done this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Listen,</v>

2318
01:40:18.270 --> 01:40:19.890
<v Speaker 4>he's a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have hobbies.</v>

2319
01:40:20.680 --> 01:40:21.870
<v Speaker 4>He's out there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jack and shit.</v>

2320
01:40:21.900 --> 01:40:22.480
<v Speaker 4>That's what he does.</v>

2321
01:40:22.480 --> 01:40:24.000
<v Speaker 4>Just put them in a zoo and let them</v>
<v Speaker 4>keep,</v>

2322
01:40:24.001 --> 01:40:27.420
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would rather kill them and put them in</v>

2323
01:40:27.421 --> 01:40:28.830
<v Speaker 4>a zoo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2324
01:40:28.890 --> 01:40:31.590
<v Speaker 4>not that I want to kill them either.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just think he should probably be moved</v>

2325
01:40:31.591 --> 01:40:34.710
<v Speaker 4>to somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We could have a more fruitful life.</v>

2326
01:40:34.740 --> 01:40:38.490
<v Speaker 4>Take them to Africa and put them out on</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Savannah is just not good when he's</v>

2327
01:40:38.491 --> 01:40:41.850
<v Speaker 4>living around people and he's choosing</v>
<v Speaker 4>to kill their pets and livestock.</v>

2328
01:40:41.880 --> 01:40:43.400
<v Speaker 4>Either you're going to kill them or are</v>
<v Speaker 4>you going to move on,</v>

2329
01:40:43.430 --> 01:40:46.860
<v Speaker 4>but we chose to be in his way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He has 10 days.</v>

2330
01:40:46.890 --> 01:40:49.710
<v Speaker 4>The permit allows the rancher,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's called a depredation permit.</v>

2331
01:40:50.010 --> 01:40:53.890
<v Speaker 4>They allow the ranch or 10 days to</v>
<v Speaker 4>search for p 45 within a 10 mile range</v>

2332
01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:57.070
<v Speaker 4>of the ranch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The ranch may also hire a hunter under</v>

2333
01:40:57.071 --> 01:40:58.780
<v Speaker 4>the terms of the depredation order.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>

2334
01:40:58.781 --> 01:40:59.590
<v Speaker 4>that's what they do.</v>

2335
01:40:59.590 --> 01:41:03.670
<v Speaker 4>They hire hunter and the hunter comes</v>
<v Speaker 4>with dogs and the dogs find the mountain</v>

2336
01:41:03.671 --> 01:41:04.750
<v Speaker 4>lion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because guess what bitch?</v>

2337
01:41:04.780 --> 01:41:07.180
<v Speaker 4>You're not finding them outline.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If the mountain lion doesn't want you to</v>

2338
01:41:07.181 --> 01:41:08.290
<v Speaker 4>find them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not finding them.</v>

2339
01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:10.720
<v Speaker 4>Most people that live up to it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even with a tracking device,</v>

2340
01:41:11.140 --> 01:41:12.280
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not going to find them.</v>

2341
01:41:12.281 --> 01:41:14.320
<v Speaker 4>You're going to know where he is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you won't be able to get near him.</v>

2342
01:41:14.470 --> 01:41:16.390
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's going to know where you are unless</v>

2343
01:41:16.391 --> 01:41:21.391
<v Speaker 4>you figured out a way to circle the area</v>
<v Speaker 4>where he is and have like a large number</v>

2344
01:41:21.401 --> 01:41:22.390
<v Speaker 4>of people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2345
01:41:22.391 --> 01:41:25.330
<v Speaker 4>like an army and the old timey days and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then come at each other with spears.</v>

2346
01:41:25.600 --> 01:41:28.090
<v Speaker 4>And then just start moving in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you would have to have so many</v>

2347
01:41:28.091 --> 01:41:30.940
<v Speaker 4>fucking people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'd circle an enormous area because</v>

2348
01:41:30.941 --> 01:41:34.180
<v Speaker 4>he's going to be what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's going to smell you from a mile</v>

2349
01:41:34.181 --> 01:41:35.650
<v Speaker 4>away,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like literally a mile away.</v>

2350
01:41:35.650 --> 01:41:37.000
<v Speaker 4>They'll run.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When they smell you,</v>

2351
01:41:37.150 --> 01:41:38.830
<v Speaker 4>he could see you way better than you</v>
<v Speaker 4>could see.</v>

2352
01:41:39.190 --> 01:41:40.510
<v Speaker 4>I appreciate that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let them go.</v>

2353
01:41:40.600 --> 01:41:42.880
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty dope.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's not.</v>

2354
01:41:42.881 --> 01:41:45.160
<v Speaker 4>I don't appreciate it in a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a zoo.</v>

2355
01:41:45.190 --> 01:41:46.570
<v Speaker 4>I think in a zoo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's the,</v>

2356
01:41:47.050 --> 01:41:48.880
<v Speaker 4>that's the worst thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could do it a lot of,</v>

2357
01:41:48.890 --> 01:41:50.770
<v Speaker 4>one minute to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I also don't want them good.</v>

2358
01:41:51.020 --> 01:41:53.890
<v Speaker 4>But why is he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't it more dead to be in a zoo then</v>

2359
01:41:53.950 --> 01:41:56.530
<v Speaker 4>to give your life to the organisms in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ground,</v>

2360
01:41:56.570 --> 01:41:59.590
<v Speaker 4>like nature intended that was put out</v>
<v Speaker 4>there in the wild.</v>

2361
01:41:59.650 --> 01:42:02.920
<v Speaker 4>I mean if you have that Alpaca killing</v>
<v Speaker 4>monster,</v>

2362
01:42:03.070 --> 01:42:05.290
<v Speaker 4>that goat slaying monster just gets</v>
<v Speaker 4>shot.</v>

2363
01:42:05.980 --> 01:42:06.880
<v Speaker 4>The coyotes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Itam.</v>

2364
01:42:06.910 --> 01:42:08.740
<v Speaker 4>Everybody eats them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody gets off.</v>

2365
01:42:09.320 --> 01:42:10.720
<v Speaker 4>We're fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we're models or you know,</v>

2366
01:42:10.721 --> 01:42:13.630
<v Speaker 4>maybe he'll put them in the zoo and</v>
<v Speaker 4>eventually he'll escaping.</v>

2367
01:42:13.870 --> 01:42:15.070
<v Speaker 4>Grab a kid there too.</v>

2368
01:42:15.190 --> 01:42:17.140
<v Speaker 4>Did you see that one?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The zoo that killed a Koala,</v>

2369
01:42:17.590 --> 01:42:19.500
<v Speaker 4>the La Zoo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Critical.</v>

2370
01:42:19.540 --> 01:42:22.450
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Climbed a fucking barbwire fence.</v>

2371
01:42:23.080 --> 01:42:25.780
<v Speaker 4>Got into the Koala cage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>killed the Koala.</v>

2372
01:42:25.840 --> 01:42:29.280
<v Speaker 4>Those must look so appetizing after</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've been in your cage for a year.</v>

2373
01:42:29.590 --> 01:42:33.130
<v Speaker 4>Like I am this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's snacks living next door,</v>

2374
01:42:33.350 --> 01:42:35.710
<v Speaker 4>but he's not in a cage though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's outside.</v>

2375
01:42:35.720 --> 01:42:39.280
<v Speaker 4>He's outside.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a legit wild mountain and he saw</v>

2376
01:42:39.281 --> 01:42:40.300
<v Speaker 4>this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a qual.</v>

2377
01:42:40.301 --> 01:42:42.380
<v Speaker 4>Was it a qualler Panda Koala?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2378
01:42:42.610 --> 01:42:44.680
<v Speaker 4>He saw the things like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can fucking definitely that too.</v>

2379
01:42:44.700 --> 01:42:48.280
<v Speaker 4>And he realized he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a whole pin of snacks right</v>

2380
01:42:48.340 --> 01:42:51.370
<v Speaker 4>there so I don't get in there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was so baffled like how did he get</v>

2381
01:42:51.371 --> 01:42:54.280
<v Speaker 4>over the barbed wire?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He figured out a way to get over the</v>

2382
01:42:54.310 --> 01:42:56.950
<v Speaker 4>bar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got to the rafters,</v>

2383
01:42:57.480 --> 01:42:59.650
<v Speaker 4>figured out how to open door handles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dude.</v>

2384
01:43:00.880 --> 01:43:02.620
<v Speaker 4>Amazing creation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just.</v>

2385
01:43:02.740 --> 01:43:07.180
<v Speaker 4>It's so cool that nature has all these</v>
<v Speaker 4>varieties of amazing things that you</v>

2386
01:43:07.181 --> 01:43:10.840
<v Speaker 4>could kind of pay attention to if you</v>
<v Speaker 4>really want to really spend a day</v>

2387
01:43:10.870 --> 01:43:14.670
<v Speaker 4>looking at all the wide variety of</v>
<v Speaker 4>bizarre animals were playing a video the</v>

2388
01:43:14.671 --> 01:43:17.260
<v Speaker 4>other day of a road runner that kills</v>
<v Speaker 4>and eats rattlesnake.</v>

2389
01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:19.610
<v Speaker 4>Did you know that road runners eat</v>
<v Speaker 4>rattlesnakes now,</v>

2390
01:43:19.750 --> 01:43:22.650
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So crazy like it to death with.</v>

2391
01:43:22.651 --> 01:43:25.510
<v Speaker 4>Does rabbit by the head and then smash</v>
<v Speaker 4>his head on rocks.</v>

2392
01:43:26.630 --> 01:43:29.470
<v Speaker 4>That's playful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Playful.</v>

2393
01:43:29.590 --> 01:43:31.300
<v Speaker 4>He need to see this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see this?</v>

2394
01:43:31.301 --> 01:43:32.860
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't believe it.</v>

2395
01:43:32.861 --> 01:43:33.551
<v Speaker 4>I saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2396
01:43:33.551 --> 01:43:34.600
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this can't be real.</v>

2397
01:43:35.080 --> 01:43:37.340
<v Speaker 4>Did you see the one with the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was it a road runner was on.</v>

2398
01:43:37.390 --> 01:43:42.390
<v Speaker 4>It was chasing like bikers on by on</v>
<v Speaker 4>bicycles and it's just like going with</v>

2399
01:43:42.681 --> 01:43:45.160
<v Speaker 4>them for like miles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2400
01:43:45.161 --> 01:43:46.750
<v Speaker 4>he is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at this bad motherfucker.</v>

2401
01:43:48.030 --> 01:43:50.410
<v Speaker 4>A little more of the video there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess they were in a fight before he</v>

2402
01:43:50.411 --> 01:43:53.300
<v Speaker 4>got ahold of him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They go at it for awhile and pull them</v>

2403
01:43:53.310 --> 01:43:55.570
<v Speaker 4>so he gets them by the top of the head</v>
<v Speaker 4>and not why.</v>

2404
01:43:55.630 --> 01:43:56.900
<v Speaker 4>Look how he does doesn't mean here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2405
01:43:56.960 --> 01:44:01.960
<v Speaker 4>smash bleed is fucking dinosaur,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2406
01:44:02.430 --> 01:44:05.360
<v Speaker 4>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 4>getting bitten because he's got a hold</v>

2407
01:44:05.361 --> 01:44:07.160
<v Speaker 4>of him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's got a hold of his job.</v>

2408
01:44:07.190 --> 01:44:10.880
<v Speaker 4>Look what he did to his jaw.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He figured out a way to bite his top jaw</v>

2409
01:44:11.420 --> 01:44:14.660
<v Speaker 4>and then smash his head on the rocks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just killed it.</v>

2410
01:44:15.230 --> 01:44:17.160
<v Speaker 4>And then he starts eating it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which Watch,</v>

2411
01:44:17.170 --> 01:44:17.901
<v Speaker 4>watch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When he eats it,</v>

2412
01:44:17.901 --> 01:44:20.090
<v Speaker 4>it's even more bizarre because it's so</v>
<v Speaker 4>big.</v>

2413
01:44:21.200 --> 01:44:23.720
<v Speaker 4>That's an amazing creation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at it.</v>

2414
01:44:23.780 --> 01:44:28.390
<v Speaker 4>He's eating this snake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's down in one bite.</v>

2415
01:44:28.530 --> 01:44:32.950
<v Speaker 4>This is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What a crazy dinosaur.</v>

2416
01:44:32.951 --> 01:44:37.720
<v Speaker 4>Like tiny animal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever heard of terror birds?</v>

2417
01:44:38.170 --> 01:44:40.440
<v Speaker 4>No terror birds were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2418
01:44:40.620 --> 01:44:42.370
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a road runner type bird,</v>

2419
01:44:42.610 --> 01:44:43.630
<v Speaker 4>but nine feet</v>

2420
01:44:43.970 --> 01:44:44.803
<v Speaker 9>tall,</v>

2421
01:44:45.700 --> 01:44:48.580
<v Speaker 4>nice flightless birds that lived,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2422
01:44:48.610 --> 01:44:52.690
<v Speaker 4>in a thing in the Jurassic or the select</v>
<v Speaker 4>pterodactyls.</v>

2423
01:44:52.691 --> 01:44:53.950
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2424
01:44:54.010 --> 01:44:54.761
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2425
01:44:54.761 --> 01:44:58.000
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't the Jurassic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was like somewhere around</v>

2426
01:44:58.001 --> 01:44:59.500
<v Speaker 4>like 15,</v>
<v Speaker 4>16,000 years ago.</v>

2427
01:44:59.501 --> 01:44:59.850
<v Speaker 4>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

2428
01:44:59.850 --> 01:45:01.540
<v Speaker 4>I wrong about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When,</v>

2429
01:45:01.660 --> 01:45:04.030
<v Speaker 4>when did terror birds go extinct?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Might have been a lot longer.</v>

2430
01:45:04.190 --> 01:45:05.530
<v Speaker 4>It might have been like 100,000 years</v>
<v Speaker 4>ago,</v>

2431
01:45:05.531 --> 01:45:07.780
<v Speaker 4>but it wasn't so long ago that there</v>
<v Speaker 4>weren't people.</v>

2432
01:45:07.900 --> 01:45:11.710
<v Speaker 4>There were people alive when these</v>
<v Speaker 4>things were alive and they were these</v>

2433
01:45:11.740 --> 01:45:14.350
<v Speaker 4>giant nine foot predatory birds</v>

2434
01:45:15.390 --> 01:45:18.690
<v Speaker 2>that look well because dinosaurs are</v>
<v Speaker 2>closely related to birds.</v>

2435
01:45:18.870 --> 01:45:19.611
<v Speaker 2>Basically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Burdens.</v>

2436
01:45:19.611 --> 01:45:21.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>

2437
01:45:21.600 --> 01:45:24.870
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Lee Camp Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing.</v>

2438
01:45:24.871 --> 01:45:26.150
<v Speaker 2>You were talking a half million years</v>
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>

2439
01:45:26.151 --> 01:45:26.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2440
01:45:26.790 --> 01:45:28.980
<v Speaker 2>so before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before people am I talking about,</v>

2441
01:45:29.010 --> 01:45:30.910
<v Speaker 2>but who gives me the mic?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they should.</v>

2442
01:45:31.200 --> 01:45:32.970
<v Speaker 2>They should have been here that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>should bring them back.</v>

2443
01:45:32.971 --> 01:45:34.100
<v Speaker 2>We can do it now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm probably.</v>

2444
01:45:34.180 --> 01:45:35.340
<v Speaker 2>Look what they looked like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Clone them.</v>

2445
01:45:35.610 --> 01:45:37.590
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those should be walking around and then</v>

2446
01:45:37.591 --> 01:45:40.050
<v Speaker 2>you have fewer people than those two and</v>
<v Speaker 2>a half million years ago.</v>

2447
01:45:40.620 --> 01:45:44.130
<v Speaker 2>So what was a two and a half million</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago when we like a Australia</v>

2448
01:45:44.170 --> 01:45:45.840
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what we were back then?</v>

2449
01:45:48.580 --> 01:45:49.413
<v Speaker 9>Wow.</v>

2450
01:45:49.830 --> 01:45:52.010
<v Speaker 2>Look at that bird and the reign of</v>
<v Speaker 2>terror.</v>

2451
01:45:52.160 --> 01:45:53.340
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2452
01:45:53.880 --> 01:45:57.750
<v Speaker 2>Gorging on a smorgasbord of planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any mammals until the scary birds</v>

2453
01:45:57.751 --> 01:46:00.000
<v Speaker 2>disappeared.</v>
<v Speaker 2>About two point 5 billion years ago.</v>

2454
01:46:00.240 --> 01:46:05.070
<v Speaker 2>So if you had to guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're humans two point $5 million years</v>

2455
01:46:05.071 --> 01:46:08.760
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like hairy ape things will make things</v>

2456
01:46:09.130 --> 01:46:11.100
<v Speaker 2>sound good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet they were scared of that fucking</v>

2457
01:46:11.101 --> 01:46:12.290
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck yeah.</v>

2458
01:46:12.960 --> 01:46:14.940
<v Speaker 2>That's probably why we were scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A little eight things.</v>

2459
01:46:15.300 --> 01:46:18.930
<v Speaker 2>Maybe once that thing died off we came</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of the cave and getting our shit</v>

2460
01:46:18.931 --> 01:46:23.931
<v Speaker 2>together down from the trees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's weird that that's our logo to write</v>

2461
01:46:25.020 --> 01:46:27.120
<v Speaker 2>an eagle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's our mascot.</v>

2462
01:46:27.780 --> 01:46:29.290
<v Speaker 2>A flying tera Byrd.</v>

2463
01:46:34.450 --> 01:46:36.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boot camps and how you feel about life</v>

2464
01:46:36.851 --> 01:46:38.280
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2465
01:46:38.350 --> 01:46:40.080
<v Speaker 2>but you were talking about too many</v>
<v Speaker 2>people telling you,</v>

2466
01:46:40.081 --> 01:46:43.120
<v Speaker 2>you bring back a couple terror birds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You let them lose fewer people.</v>

2467
01:46:43.820 --> 01:46:45.640
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not the way to handle it.</v>

2468
01:46:45.780 --> 01:46:47.710
<v Speaker 2>Lee Camp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're going to get you to.</v>

2469
01:46:47.800 --> 01:46:50.550
<v Speaker 2>And they're going to get me through out</v>
<v Speaker 2>the target parking lot.</v>

2470
01:46:50.790 --> 01:46:51.511
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the problem.</v>

2471
01:46:51.511 --> 01:46:53.280
<v Speaker 2>You have kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're worried that mountain lions</v>

2472
01:46:53.281 --> 01:46:55.050
<v Speaker 2>going to get them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm worried about my kids,</v>

2473
01:46:55.051 --> 01:46:57.720
<v Speaker 2>but I'm definitely worried about me too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about you man?</v>

2474
01:46:58.050 --> 01:46:59.100
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my kids might not run.</v>

2475
01:46:59.101 --> 01:47:03.130
<v Speaker 2>You better know how to choke out a</v>
<v Speaker 2>mountain lions right to work.</v>

2476
01:47:04.140 --> 01:47:05.880
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think,</v>

2477
01:47:05.970 --> 01:47:07.530
<v Speaker 2>honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think there's too many people?</v>

2478
01:47:07.560 --> 01:47:09.480
<v Speaker 2>Do you think it's possible that we could</v>
<v Speaker 2>balance it out?</v>

2479
01:47:10.290 --> 01:47:11.220
<v Speaker 2>I think we could balance it out.</v>

2480
01:47:11.220 --> 01:47:13.200
<v Speaker 2>I think if we use technology</v>
<v Speaker 2>appropriately,</v>

2481
01:47:13.201 --> 01:47:14.970
<v Speaker 2>I mean we throw away 40 percent of our</v>
<v Speaker 2>food,</v>

2482
01:47:15.380 --> 01:47:16.650
<v Speaker 2>so it's like we really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2483
01:47:16.860 --> 01:47:19.350
<v Speaker 2>but if we give that 40 percent away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe they'll just keep fucking and</v>

2484
01:47:19.351 --> 01:47:22.350
<v Speaker 2>having more babies more doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eventually we'll get there too.</v>

2485
01:47:23.400 --> 01:47:25.200
<v Speaker 2>Who's they?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those other people.</v>

2486
01:47:26.040 --> 01:47:27.870
<v Speaker 2>The other is what were you pulling up</v>
<v Speaker 2>over there?</v>

2487
01:47:27.871 --> 01:47:29.820
<v Speaker 2>Jamie doesn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2488
01:47:29.821 --> 01:47:32.850
<v Speaker 2>it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is a weird thing when you look at</v>

2489
01:47:32.851 --> 01:47:36.360
<v Speaker 2>someplace like India that has one third</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the landmass.</v>

2490
01:47:37.410 --> 01:47:41.400
<v Speaker 2>We could live in a sustainable way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're not doing it at all and the</v>

2491
01:47:41.401 --> 01:47:44.730
<v Speaker 2>planet is collapsing under the weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But how would you decide like when it</v>

2492
01:47:44.731 --> 01:47:47.580
<v Speaker 2>comes to overpopulation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>without doing the China thing,</v>

2493
01:47:47.810 --> 01:47:49.770
<v Speaker 2>the one baby thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which really didn't work at all,</v>

2494
01:47:50.460 --> 01:47:53.070
<v Speaker 2>like kind of fucked up everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a disaster.</v>

2495
01:47:53.760 --> 01:47:56.250
<v Speaker 2>People throwing babies and over bridges.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not only that,</v>

2496
01:47:56.251 --> 01:47:58.570
<v Speaker 2>they had like 70 percent men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2497
01:47:58.620 --> 01:48:00.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had some bizarre thing because they</v>

2498
01:48:00.481 --> 01:48:01.830
<v Speaker 2>wanted more men than women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2499
01:48:02.540 --> 01:48:03.090
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2500
01:48:03.090 --> 01:48:05.070
<v Speaker 2>because everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way their culture works is the,</v>

2501
01:48:05.080 --> 01:48:07.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the man inherits all the.</v>

2502
01:48:08.080 --> 01:48:09.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They wanted a boy.</v>

2503
01:48:10.370 --> 01:48:13.140
<v Speaker 2>That's not a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seventy percent men.</v>

2504
01:48:13.141 --> 01:48:14.730
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a mess.</v>

2505
01:48:14.760 --> 01:48:17.460
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot of sad men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many different continents right now</v>

2506
01:48:17.470 --> 01:48:22.470
<v Speaker 2>have more than a billion people on them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's India have no idea if you had a</v>

2507
01:48:22.891 --> 01:48:24.570
<v Speaker 2>gas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so quiz.</v>

2508
01:48:25.590 --> 01:48:26.423
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it depends on what.</v>

2509
01:48:28.440 --> 01:48:32.460
<v Speaker 2>It depends on what you're considering a</v>
<v Speaker 2>continent because you've got Eurasia,</v>

2510
01:48:32.470 --> 01:48:33.780
<v Speaker 2>you've got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2511
01:48:33.781 --> 01:48:36.630
<v Speaker 2>we're talking landmasses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true,</v>

2512
01:48:37.290 --> 01:48:39.740
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2513
01:48:39.741 --> 01:48:41.090
<v Speaker 2>A lot of hugging people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>countries.</v>

2514
01:48:41.091 --> 01:48:45.020
<v Speaker 2>It might only be China and India that</v>
<v Speaker 2>have over a billion.</v>

2515
01:48:47.110 --> 01:48:49.480
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot of fucking people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>

2516
01:48:49.481 --> 01:48:51.820
<v Speaker 2>When you look back just a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 2>hundred years ago with the numbers of</v>

2517
01:48:51.821 --> 01:48:56.130
<v Speaker 2>people that were alive in an will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>populations go on like this.</v>

2518
01:48:56.140 --> 01:48:57.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's shooting through the roof.</v>

2519
01:48:57.550 --> 01:48:58.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy.</v>

2520
01:48:58.250 --> 01:49:00.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was the 19 seventies.</v>

2521
01:49:00.011 --> 01:49:04.420
<v Speaker 2>The world population was in like $2,</v>
<v Speaker 2>billion range and now it's what?</v>

2522
01:49:04.470 --> 01:49:06.040
<v Speaker 2>Seven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>7 billion?</v>

2523
01:49:06.041 --> 01:49:08.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not good.</v>

2524
01:49:08.771 --> 01:49:09.890
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem is we've wiped out all the</v>

2525
01:49:09.891 --> 01:49:11.790
<v Speaker 2>diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you need some real good diseases</v>

2526
01:49:11.810 --> 01:49:14.800
<v Speaker 2>running to really to clear out the</v>
<v Speaker 2>underbrush,</v>

2527
01:49:15.030 --> 01:49:16.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you should say that</v>

2528
01:49:18.670 --> 01:49:22.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm making you uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We went to the CDC wants me and Duncan</v>

2529
01:49:22.480 --> 01:49:25.570
<v Speaker 2>Trussell for this show I was doing and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we talked to all these disease guys.</v>

2530
01:49:25.720 --> 01:49:26.740
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's really interesting,</v>

2531
01:49:27.190 --> 01:49:29.500
<v Speaker 2>they're terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The people that run the CDC,</v>

2532
01:49:29.501 --> 01:49:32.110
<v Speaker 2>they are legitimately terrified of</v>
<v Speaker 2>pandemics.</v>

2533
01:49:32.260 --> 01:49:34.240
<v Speaker 2>Like legitimately they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not worried about.</v>

2534
01:49:34.240 --> 01:49:36.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will you guys worried about weaponized</v>

2535
01:49:36.190 --> 01:49:36.700
<v Speaker 2>w,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2536
01:49:36.700 --> 01:49:40.360
<v Speaker 2>diseases and anthrax on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we are worried about regular</v>

2537
01:49:40.361 --> 01:49:45.361
<v Speaker 2>diseases that just go a muck that just</v>
<v Speaker 2>go Spanish flu on people just start</v>

2538
01:49:45.610 --> 01:49:47.380
<v Speaker 2>slaughtering massive amounts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People.</v>

2539
01:49:48.010 --> 01:49:48.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2540
01:49:49.300 --> 01:49:52.690
<v Speaker 2>and I think a large reason that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>fear that is because the overuse of</v>

2541
01:49:52.691 --> 01:49:55.270
<v Speaker 2>antibiotics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of that is in factory farming</v>

2542
01:49:55.620 --> 01:49:56.530
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2543
01:49:56.610 --> 01:49:58.740
<v Speaker 2>So with these most antibiotics pump they</v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

2544
01:49:58.780 --> 01:50:02.380
<v Speaker 2>it's like 70 percent of antibiotics or</v>
<v Speaker 2>more than that is used in factory farms.</v>

2545
01:50:02.381 --> 01:50:04.780
<v Speaker 2>They pump these animals full of it</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're these animals that are</v>

2546
01:50:04.781 --> 01:50:07.690
<v Speaker 2>living on top of each other and each</v>
<v Speaker 2>other's shit and the only way to have</v>

2547
01:50:07.691 --> 01:50:12.560
<v Speaker 2>them survive is to pump them full of</v>
<v Speaker 2>antibiotics and so then that immunity to</v>

2548
01:50:12.561 --> 01:50:14.240
<v Speaker 2>antibiotics and spreads to us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2549
01:50:14.241 --> 01:50:15.860
<v Speaker 2>That's where the next pandemic will come</v>
<v Speaker 2>from.</v>

2550
01:50:15.861 --> 01:50:18.890
<v Speaker 2>Factory farming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was watching this video online</v>

2551
01:50:18.891 --> 01:50:22.940
<v Speaker 2>yesterday of this girl who is a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's like a Vegan activist who had this</v>

2552
01:50:22.941 --> 01:50:25.760
<v Speaker 2>video about why do we Turkey on</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thanksgiving?</v>

2553
01:50:25.761 --> 01:50:27.830
<v Speaker 2>It's really well done video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's very.</v>

2554
01:50:27.860 --> 01:50:29.600
<v Speaker 2>It's very smartly</v>

2555
01:50:30.070 --> 01:50:34.810
<v Speaker 6>edited and very smartly narrated and she</v>
<v Speaker 6>starts talking about the Turkey</v>

2556
01:50:34.811 --> 01:50:36.490
<v Speaker 6>industry,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but she sets it up really well.</v>

2557
01:50:36.491 --> 01:50:39.430
<v Speaker 6>Like what did we just sort of do it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like why do we turn?</v>

2558
01:50:39.910 --> 01:50:43.540
<v Speaker 6>And then she takes you to this Mike Rowe</v>
<v Speaker 6>episode where they show how they get</v>

2559
01:50:43.570 --> 01:50:48.400
<v Speaker 6>Turkey come and then all these turkeys</v>
<v Speaker 6>are so they're so overbred and fucked up</v>

2560
01:50:48.401 --> 01:50:51.310
<v Speaker 6>and they're so big so quick.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You literally can't physically have sex</v>

2561
01:50:51.420 --> 01:50:55.450
<v Speaker 6>and then I can't walk yet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So these artificial insemination and so</v>

2562
01:50:55.451 --> 01:50:58.990
<v Speaker 6>this guy has to literally talks to talk</v>
<v Speaker 6>sweet to them.</v>

2563
01:50:59.020 --> 01:51:00.170
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you gotta start sweet to them.</v>

2564
01:51:00.720 --> 01:51:04.840
<v Speaker 6>They have this Turkey's legs clamp down</v>
<v Speaker 6>on this machine and then he's like</v>

2565
01:51:05.110 --> 01:51:10.110
<v Speaker 6>touching it's prostate and with a tube</v>
<v Speaker 6>and it's like Whoa,</v>

2566
01:51:10.380 --> 01:51:13.360
<v Speaker 6>because it has one hole and sucking it</v>
<v Speaker 6>in,</v>

2567
01:51:13.361 --> 01:51:15.580
<v Speaker 6>sucking it out with a straw.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Turkey's got to be like,</v>

2568
01:51:15.581 --> 01:51:18.810
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Exactly.</v>

2569
01:51:19.030 --> 01:51:20.680
<v Speaker 6>He's getting settled.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's coming.</v>

2570
01:51:20.830 --> 01:51:23.800
<v Speaker 6>This guy has a tube.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's sucking the come out of this</v>

2571
01:51:23.801 --> 01:51:25.190
<v Speaker 6>Turkey's whole,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2572
01:51:25.191 --> 01:51:28.450
<v Speaker 6>because they have like that one sort of</v>
<v Speaker 6>universal whole for everything.</v>

2573
01:51:28.530 --> 01:51:30.460
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And as he's sucking to come out of it,</v>

2574
01:51:30.461 --> 01:51:33.580
<v Speaker 6>he has a glass of bottle water with them</v>
<v Speaker 6>because sometimes it gets in his mouth</v>

2575
01:51:33.581 --> 01:51:37.340
<v Speaker 6>so he has to clean it out like kind of a</v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking job.</v>

2576
01:51:37.341 --> 01:51:38.560
<v Speaker 6>But this is the only way you can get</v>
<v Speaker 6>this done.</v>

2577
01:51:39.320 --> 01:51:41.880
<v Speaker 2>Turkey rape should be illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Totally illegal,</v>

2578
01:51:42.110 --> 01:51:43.790
<v Speaker 2>but it's amazing that nobody talks about</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2579
01:51:44.030 --> 01:51:48.590
<v Speaker 2>But everybody talks about like force</v>
<v Speaker 2>feeding ducks to get fog was like,</v>

2580
01:51:48.591 --> 01:51:50.300
<v Speaker 2>how'd you guys missed that one?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2581
01:51:50.750 --> 01:51:51.960
<v Speaker 2>what could they do into that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Turkey's</v>

2582
01:51:53.530 --> 01:51:55.640
<v Speaker 2>how come you guys everybody's fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>sick and,</v>

2583
01:51:55.650 --> 01:51:56.810
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you're talking about.</v>

2584
01:51:56.811 --> 01:51:59.540
<v Speaker 2>Then they pump them full of these</v>
<v Speaker 2>hormones to make them too big.</v>

2585
01:51:59.541 --> 01:52:04.541
<v Speaker 2>It's like pigs in factory farming are</v>
<v Speaker 2>made so big that they can hardly move</v>

2586
01:52:05.540 --> 01:52:08.870
<v Speaker 2>and then when they have them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they take them out to the killing</v>

2587
01:52:08.871 --> 01:52:11.480
<v Speaker 2>floor or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've never really walked very far.</v>

2588
01:52:11.481 --> 01:52:15.650
<v Speaker 2>Some of them collapse under the stress</v>
<v Speaker 2>of like walking 10 feet.</v>

2589
01:52:16.230 --> 01:52:20.930
<v Speaker 2>It's six system is weird too because</v>
<v Speaker 2>pigs are smart.</v>

2590
01:52:21.440 --> 01:52:22.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>emotionally really smart.</v>

2591
01:52:23.450 --> 01:52:25.610
<v Speaker 2>There was a documentary once called my</v>
<v Speaker 2>brother's keeper.</v>

2592
01:52:25.700 --> 01:52:29.690
<v Speaker 2>It was about these mentally challenged</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys that were being put up for murder.</v>

2593
01:52:29.691 --> 01:52:34.610
<v Speaker 2>Did you ever see it so long time ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I remember when I watched it,</v>

2594
01:52:34.640 --> 01:52:38.540
<v Speaker 2>there was a scene because they were</v>
<v Speaker 2>rural farmers and they were being</v>

2595
01:52:38.541 --> 01:52:42.830
<v Speaker 2>charged with murder and apparently they</v>
<v Speaker 2>were just really mentally slow and</v>

2596
01:52:42.831 --> 01:52:45.650
<v Speaker 2>incapable of sort of understanding the</v>
<v Speaker 2>charges that are being levied against</v>

2597
01:52:45.651 --> 01:52:46.460
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

2598
01:52:46.460 --> 01:52:49.280
<v Speaker 4>but when they were running this farm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was one scene where they had to</v>

2599
01:52:49.281 --> 01:52:53.810
<v Speaker 4>execute a pig and the guy pulls out the</v>
<v Speaker 4>gun and he starts going towards the pig</v>

2600
01:52:53.811 --> 01:52:58.010
<v Speaker 4>and the pig recognizes the gun and just</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking panics like the pig who had been</v>

2601
01:52:58.011 --> 01:53:00.380
<v Speaker 4>around him all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It never worried at all.</v>

2602
01:53:00.800 --> 01:53:05.800
<v Speaker 4>Saw that gun and freak the fuck out and</v>
<v Speaker 4>just started running and running around</v>

2603
01:53:05.901 --> 01:53:08.960
<v Speaker 4>and he's chasing it and then he shoots</v>
<v Speaker 4>it in the head and I remember thinking,</v>

2604
01:53:08.961 --> 01:53:10.250
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that pig new.</v>

2605
01:53:10.410 --> 01:53:11.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

2606
01:53:11.080 --> 01:53:13.100
<v Speaker 2>Peg knew what the gun was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

2607
01:53:13.380 --> 01:53:17.140
<v Speaker 2>that's a level of intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's super uncomfortable and they're</v>

2608
01:53:17.860 --> 01:53:22.860
<v Speaker 2>fucking smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the problem with pigs is they go</v>

2609
01:53:23.821 --> 01:53:25.830
<v Speaker 2>wild.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought you were gonna say the problem</v>

2610
01:53:25.831 --> 01:53:27.330
<v Speaker 2>is the delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2611
01:53:27.390 --> 01:53:31.560
<v Speaker 2>I was gonna say the real problem with</v>
<v Speaker 2>pigs is what do you do with them all?</v>

2612
01:53:32.460 --> 01:53:35.250
<v Speaker 2>Like pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pigs are like super prolific breeders.</v>

2613
01:53:35.430 --> 01:53:37.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He received wild pigs.</v>

2614
01:53:38.390 --> 01:53:39.590
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can't.</v>

2615
01:53:39.680 --> 01:53:43.150
<v Speaker 2>I know that the too much right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that exists.</v>

2616
01:53:43.680 --> 01:53:44.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were um,</v>

2617
01:53:44.820 --> 01:53:48.570
<v Speaker 2>all over Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Texas is so crazy with them and it's not</v>

2618
01:53:48.600 --> 01:53:50.430
<v Speaker 2>nice to call the people at Texas wild</v>
<v Speaker 2>pig.</v>

2619
01:53:50.520 --> 01:53:51.870
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I meant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's too much.</v>

2620
01:53:51.880 --> 01:53:54.900
<v Speaker 2>Just that's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How's Ted Cruz keep getting elected?</v>

2621
01:53:55.170 --> 01:53:56.003
<v Speaker 2>Tell me about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

2622
01:53:56.030 --> 01:53:57.300
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you understand politics.</v>

2623
01:53:57.360 --> 01:53:58.350
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck's going on there?</v>

2624
01:53:58.460 --> 01:54:00.560
<v Speaker 5>Because he's in the middle of fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2625
01:54:00.880 --> 01:54:02.960
<v Speaker 4>but how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do they not even look at him?</v>

2626
01:54:02.961 --> 01:54:06.320
<v Speaker 4>Like people should be looking at Jim</v>
<v Speaker 4>Baker with his fucking furniture made</v>

2627
01:54:06.321 --> 01:54:07.154
<v Speaker 4>out of survival.</v>

2628
01:54:07.520 --> 01:54:11.030
<v Speaker 5>How they should be looking at him the</v>
<v Speaker 5>same exact way.</v>

2629
01:54:11.031 --> 01:54:12.190
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

2630
01:54:12.800 --> 01:54:14.270
<v Speaker 5>they absolutely should.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They do.</v>

2631
01:54:14.660 --> 01:54:17.600
<v Speaker 5>And anybody who's ever been in a room</v>
<v Speaker 5>with Ted,</v>

2632
01:54:17.601 --> 01:54:18.830
<v Speaker 5>because you just see them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're like,</v>

2633
01:54:18.890 --> 01:54:20.150
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that guy,</v>

2634
01:54:20.300 --> 01:54:22.190
<v Speaker 5>even his own daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you were that video of his daughter</v>

2635
01:54:22.191 --> 01:54:23.320
<v Speaker 5>being like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2636
01:54:23.610 --> 01:54:24.750
<v Speaker 4>do you know the story about his</v>
<v Speaker 4>highschool?</v>

2637
01:54:24.830 --> 01:54:28.500
<v Speaker 4>Or rather his college roommate who's</v>
<v Speaker 4>like his number one troll now,</v>

2638
01:54:29.190 --> 01:54:32.010
<v Speaker 4>his college roommate brutalizes him on</v>
<v Speaker 4>twitter.</v>

2639
01:54:32.400 --> 01:54:34.860
<v Speaker 4>His college roommate is really smart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

2640
01:54:34.861 --> 01:54:39.861
<v Speaker 4>I think he's a screenwriter and he mocks</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ted Cruz so openly on twitter.</v>

2641
01:54:41.400 --> 01:54:43.830
<v Speaker 4>And he said that in order to think like</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ted Cruz,</v>

2642
01:54:44.010 --> 01:54:46.110
<v Speaker 4>you have to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And He abbreviates it out.</v>

2643
01:54:46.340 --> 01:54:48.810
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I should be present.</v>

2644
01:54:48.811 --> 01:54:53.811
<v Speaker 4>So you should have I s,</v>
<v Speaker 4>b p before everything Ted Cruz says or</v>

2645
01:54:54.271 --> 01:54:56.130
<v Speaker 4>does,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because in his mind he should be</v>

2646
01:54:56.131 --> 01:54:58.650
<v Speaker 4>president.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So before you look at anything that he</v>

2647
01:54:58.651 --> 01:55:01.920
<v Speaker 4>says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just put in his mind the thought I</v>

2648
01:55:01.921 --> 01:55:05.240
<v Speaker 4>should be president first.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then he says these things like,</v>

2649
01:55:05.310 --> 01:55:07.230
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's so good.</v>

2650
01:55:07.830 --> 01:55:09.210
<v Speaker 4>It's so good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His twitter pages,</v>

2651
01:55:09.320 --> 01:55:11.260
<v Speaker 2>marvelous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>marvelous.</v>

2652
01:55:12.270 --> 01:55:15.260
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and how sad that people are like,</v>

2653
01:55:15.440 --> 01:55:17.420
<v Speaker 2>damn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if only Ted Cruz had won fully,</v>

2654
01:55:17.421 --> 01:55:19.320
<v Speaker 2>he'd beat book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Be Trump.</v>

2655
01:55:19.800 --> 01:55:24.800
<v Speaker 2>We had a real god feeling Christian and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lighthouse instead of Tsar and</v>

2656
01:55:25.100 --> 01:55:28.220
<v Speaker 2>Fella.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a spooky</v>

2657
01:55:28.250 --> 01:55:29.020
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

2665
01:55:43.010 --> 01:55:43.980
<v Speaker 4>Do you saw that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure</v>

2666
01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:48.600
<v Speaker 2>you saw the mothering Ted Cruz in his</v>
<v Speaker 2>sleep in 1988.</v>

2667
01:55:53.400 --> 01:55:56.660
<v Speaker 2>Getting emails blaming me for not</v>
<v Speaker 2>smothering Ted Cruz in his sleep in</v>

2668
01:55:56.661 --> 01:55:58.460
<v Speaker 2>1988.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What kind of a monster you think?</v>

2669
01:55:58.461 --> 01:56:03.380
<v Speaker 2>I am a really prescient one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The kind knew by freshman year college</v>

2670
01:56:03.381 --> 01:56:05.390
<v Speaker 2>roommate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ted Cruz is going to be elected senator</v>

2671
01:56:05.570 --> 01:56:08.630
<v Speaker 2>in case I hadn't made it clear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's also a huge asshole.</v>

2672
01:56:11.690 --> 01:56:15.470
<v Speaker 2>Things people don't have a right to</v>
<v Speaker 2>stimulate their genitals.</v>

2673
01:56:16.280 --> 01:56:20.990
<v Speaker 2>This would be a new belief of his.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was his college roommate should be a</v>

2674
01:56:20.991 --> 01:56:24.020
<v Speaker 2>new believer of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a funny dude.</v>

2675
01:56:24.021 --> 01:56:25.340
<v Speaker 2>He's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't really funny,</v>

2676
01:56:25.550 --> 01:56:28.910
<v Speaker 2>but it's like Ted Cruz,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they had that video that came out</v>

2677
01:56:28.940 --> 01:56:32.310
<v Speaker 2>where they were all making that family</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>

2678
01:56:32.330 --> 01:56:34.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was supposed to be sort of a candid</v>

2679
01:56:34.311 --> 01:56:37.010
<v Speaker 2>moment with the families all sitting</v>
<v Speaker 2>around talking and they just keep</v>

2680
01:56:37.011 --> 01:56:38.240
<v Speaker 2>redoing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Redoing.</v>

2681
01:56:38.440 --> 01:56:40.330
<v Speaker 2>Did you ever see that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You never lie.</v>

2682
01:56:40.420 --> 01:56:41.780
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's wonderful.</v>

2683
01:56:42.080 --> 01:56:44.330
<v Speaker 2>It's wonderful because they couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>look like a real family,</v>

2684
01:56:44.360 --> 01:56:47.670
<v Speaker 2>like his well all fake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says to his mom,</v>

2685
01:56:47.900 --> 01:56:51.920
<v Speaker 2>one of the things he says is my mother</v>
<v Speaker 2>will pray about me oftentimes for hours</v>

2686
01:56:51.921 --> 01:56:56.921
<v Speaker 2>a day and the mom go look</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they have like this awkward hug</v>

2687
01:56:59.181 --> 01:57:01.230
<v Speaker 2>moment where they have to Redo it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2688
01:57:01.260 --> 01:57:03.830
<v Speaker 2>so gross here plays out with this.</v>

2689
01:57:04.790 --> 01:57:06.020
<v Speaker 10>I'm just thinking for a second.</v>

2690
01:57:08.330 --> 01:57:10.210
<v Speaker 2>Who released the unedited.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2692
01:57:11.990 --> 01:57:13.710
<v Speaker 10>Why don't you say something to get him</v>
<v Speaker 10>going?</v>

2693
01:57:13.820 --> 01:57:18.230
<v Speaker 2>He sees in people what they may not see</v>
<v Speaker 2>in themselves.</v>

2694
01:57:23.190 --> 01:57:24.023
<v Speaker 10>That's his son.</v>

2695
01:57:25.040 --> 01:57:26.280

2724
01:59:00.460 --> 01:59:03.950
<v Speaker 4>You did appeal to the right people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was involved in some sort of a,</v>

2725
01:59:03.980 --> 01:59:07.270
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a law against or the enforcing of a</v>

2726
01:59:07.370 --> 01:59:11.500
<v Speaker 4>logins dildos at one point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that you never saw that.</v>

2727
01:59:12.090 --> 01:59:15.280

<v Speaker 4>wouldn't that mean he can't be senator</v>

2728
01:59:16.160 --> 01:59:19.810
<v Speaker 4>does I forget the specifics of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the law?</v>

2729
01:59:22.230 --> 01:59:25.240
<v Speaker 4>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't want people enjoying their sex</v>

2730
01:59:25.400 --> 01:59:26.470
<v Speaker 4>lives.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2731
01:59:26.471 --> 01:59:29.860
<v Speaker 4>there was a lie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was some sort of a law in place</v>

2732
01:59:29.950 --> 01:59:34.930
<v Speaker 4>about like sexual novelty devices,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like dildos and stuff and he was</v>

2733
01:59:34.931 --> 01:59:37.900
<v Speaker 4>involved in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was like a crazy law too.</v>

2734
01:59:37.950 --> 01:59:39.940
<v Speaker 4>Like you go to jail for two years or</v>
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>

2735
01:59:40.620 --> 01:59:44.060

<v Speaker 4>Ted Cruz defended a band on delay.</v>

2736
01:59:45.040 --> 01:59:47.800
<v Speaker 4>Still did enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like the look in his face like,</v>

2737
01:59:48.050 --> 01:59:51.520
<v Speaker 4>like King Kong is coming in his face.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what it looks like right there.</v>

2738
01:59:51.540 --> 01:59:52.930
<v Speaker 4>And on Dildo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2739
01:59:52.931 --> 01:59:57.520
<v Speaker 4>This was from 2003 to 2008 when he was a</v>
<v Speaker 4>solicitor general.</v>

2740
01:59:57.550 --> 02:00:00.160
<v Speaker 4>So what do they do with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do they do with Zucchinis and</v>

2741
02:00:00.161 --> 02:00:02.470
<v Speaker 4>things?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do they ban deldot shaped fruit?</v>

<v Speaker 4>Can you say anything?</v>

2744
02:00:04.691 --> 02:00:05.920
<v Speaker 4>If you're a girl,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're so lucky.</v>

2745
02:00:06.850 --> 02:00:09.430
<v Speaker 4>The case.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The case is an important battle</v>

2746
02:00:09.431 --> 02:00:12.100
<v Speaker 4>concerning privacy of free speech rights</v>
<v Speaker 4>in 2004.</v>

2747
02:00:12.100 --> 02:00:14.860
<v Speaker 4>The companies that owned Austin stores</v>
<v Speaker 4>are selling sex toys,</v>

2748
02:00:15.310 --> 02:00:17.170
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2749
02:00:17.171 --> 02:00:21.340
<v Speaker 4>products challenged the Texas law,</v>
<v Speaker 4>outlawing the sale and promotion of</v>

2750
02:00:21.341 --> 02:00:23.980
<v Speaker 4>supposedly obscene devices under the</v>
<v Speaker 4>law.</v>

2751
02:00:24.100 --> 02:00:27.640
<v Speaker 4>A person who violated the statute could,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could go to jail for up to two</v>

2752
02:00:27.641 --> 02:00:28.870
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At the time.</v>

2753
02:00:28.871 --> 02:00:30.280
<v Speaker 4>Only three states,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mississippi,</v>

2754
02:00:30.281 --> 02:00:32.530
<v Speaker 4>Alabama,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and Virginia had similar laws,</v>

2755
02:00:32.800 --> 02:00:33.191
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2760
02:00:35.381 --> 02:00:36.220
<v Speaker 4>This is what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2761
02:00:36.221 --> 02:00:39.070
<v Speaker 4>Texas mother,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who was a sales rep for passion parties,</v>

2762
02:00:39.071 --> 02:00:44.071
<v Speaker 4>was arrested by two undercover cops for</v>
<v Speaker 4>selling vibrators and other sex related</v>

2763
02:00:44.441 --> 02:00:48.640
<v Speaker 4>goods at a gathering,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a kin to a tupperware party for sex,</v>

<v Speaker 4>God had to be women by the way.</v>

02:01:11.620 --> 02:01:13.600
<v Speaker 4>the right to privacy under the 14th</v>
<v Speaker 4>amendment.</v>

2772
02:01:13.930 --> 02:01:18.040
<v Speaker 4>They argued that many people in Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you sexual devices as an aspect of their</v>

2773
02:01:18.041 --> 02:01:20.830
<v Speaker 4>sexual experiences and they claimed that</v>
<v Speaker 4>in some instances,</v>

<v Speaker 4>one partner,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a couple of my up,</v>

<v Speaker 4>So anyway,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Ted Cruz's team,</v>
<v Speaker 4>scroll down.</v>

2782

2783
02:01:30.500 --> 02:01:33.640
<v Speaker 4>there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And 2007 Ted Cruz legal team working on</v>

2784
02:01:33.641 --> 02:01:35.680
<v Speaker 4>behalf of the then Attorney General Greg</v>
<v Speaker 4>Abbott.</v>

2785
02:01:36.150 --> 02:01:41.150
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>file the 76 page brief calling on the US</v>

2786
02:01:41.180 --> 02:01:41.180
<v Speaker 4>Court of Appeals</v>

2787
02:01:41.180 --> 02:01:45.400
<v Speaker 7>for the fifth circuit to uphold the</v>
<v Speaker 7>lower court's decision and permit a lot</v>

2788
02:01:45.430 --> 02:01:48.920
<v Speaker 7>of stand.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The penal code inhibits the</v>

2789
02:01:48.921 --> 02:01:52.880
<v Speaker 7>advertisement and sale of Dildos,</v>
<v Speaker 7>artificial vaginas and other obscene</v>

2790
02:01:52.881 --> 02:01:55.310
<v Speaker 7>devices.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh my God.</v>

2791
02:01:55.311 --> 02:01:58.430
<v Speaker 7>But does not forbid the private use of</v>
<v Speaker 7>such devices.</v>

2792
02:01:58.460 --> 02:02:01.820
<v Speaker 7>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So they wanted to uphold the law.</v>

2793
02:02:01.821 --> 02:02:04.750
<v Speaker 7>That was a 76 page brief.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Listen,</v>

2794
02:02:04.760 --> 02:02:06.590
<v Speaker 7>I feel the same way about this as I do</v>
<v Speaker 7>about drugs.</v>

2795
02:02:06.591 --> 02:02:11.591
<v Speaker 7>Whatever you want to put in your body.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This is an even more innocuous.</v>

2796
02:02:12.060 --> 02:02:14.000
<v Speaker 7>This,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this doesn't even get you drunk.</v>

2797
02:02:14.690 --> 02:02:16.350
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you stick a Dildo in you,</v>

2798
02:02:16.351 --> 02:02:17.510
<v Speaker 7>you pull it out,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're sober.</v>

2799
02:02:17.790 --> 02:02:18.860
<v Speaker 7>I would imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Listen,</v>

2800
02:02:18.861 --> 02:02:21.440
<v Speaker 7>you don't remember about the Dildo</v>
<v Speaker 7>massacre of 76.</v>

2801
02:02:23.050 --> 02:02:26.220
<v Speaker 7>How could you file it?</v>
<v Speaker 7>People should go to.</v>

2802
02:02:26.470 --> 02:02:27.470
<v Speaker 7>This.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Should go to jail.</v>

2803
02:02:27.530 --> 02:02:29.330
<v Speaker 7>All of them for fraud.</v>
<v Speaker 7>First of all,</v>

2804
02:02:29.340 --> 02:02:32.210
<v Speaker 7>it took you 76 pages to figure out</v>
<v Speaker 7>whether or not someone should be able to</v>

2805
02:02:32.211 --> 02:02:33.044
<v Speaker 7>sell dildos.</v>

2806
02:02:34.220 --> 02:02:35.053
<v Speaker 7>I mean it's.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2807
02:02:35.340 --> 02:02:38.660
<v Speaker 7>they should go to jail for going against</v>
<v Speaker 7>the constitution.</v>

2808
02:02:39.140 --> 02:02:40.400
<v Speaker 7>What should it be?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Four words.</v>

2809
02:02:40.430 --> 02:02:42.140
<v Speaker 7>Who gives a fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's it.</v>

2810
02:02:42.500 --> 02:02:45.740
<v Speaker 7>Next case to what you want with your</v>
<v Speaker 7>plastic devices.</v>

2811
02:02:47.300 --> 02:02:49.400

<v Speaker 7>I was on some of these networks,</v>

2819
02:02:59.210 --> 02:03:01.280
<v Speaker 7>one guest appearance and then I was at</v>

<v Speaker 7>the laptop box.</v>

2822
02:03:05.330 --> 02:03:07.200
<v Speaker 7>It was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was on MSNBC.</v>

2823
02:03:07.201 --> 02:03:10.100
<v Speaker 7>You Dylan rat again.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The only time they've ever had me on,</v>

2824
02:03:10.330 --> 02:03:13.370
<v Speaker 7>I was on a Keith Olbermann only time</v>
<v Speaker 7>that ever happened.</v>

2825
02:03:13.371 --> 02:03:15.800
<v Speaker 7>So it's like what happened when you and</v>
<v Speaker 7>Keith Olbermann while I was a guest</v>

2826
02:03:15.801 --> 02:03:16.010

2827
02:03:16.010 --> 02:03:16.751
<v Speaker 7>It wasn't him,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but,</v>

2828
02:03:16.751 --> 02:03:17.584
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Schuster,</v>

2829
02:03:17.600 --> 02:03:19.070

<v Speaker 7>there's nothing went wrong.</v>

2830
02:03:19.071 --> 02:03:22.880
<v Speaker 7>It's just the stuff I'm saying is not,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's not good for corporations.</v>

2831
02:03:23.300 --> 02:03:25.400
<v Speaker 7>I feel like you're a very reasonable</v>
<v Speaker 7>guy.</v>

2832
02:03:26.240 --> 02:03:29.090
<v Speaker 7>I feel that way.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't think you're saying anything too</v>

2833
02:03:29.091 --> 02:03:31.720
<v Speaker 7>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So when you work for rt,</v>

2834
02:03:31.730 --> 02:03:33.320
<v Speaker 7>they pretty much let you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

2835
02:03:33.321 --> 02:03:37.580
<v Speaker 7>what kind of a editorial control they</v>
<v Speaker 7>have over your content?</v>

2836
02:03:37.610 --> 02:03:39.380
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean technically they have editorial</v>

2837
02:03:39.410 --> 02:03:41.870
<v Speaker 7>control,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I'm not told to say anything I say.</v>

2838
02:03:41.871 --> 02:03:43.100
<v Speaker 7>And that's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And yeah,</v>

2839
02:03:43.101 --> 02:03:44.060
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

<v Speaker 7>doing for years.</v>

2851
02:04:06.590 --> 02:04:08.960
<v Speaker 7>They try to ship Abby Martin off to</v>
<v Speaker 7>fucking Siberia.</v>

02:04:27.501 --> 02:04:29.270
<v Speaker 7>she's going off script.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This is not what CNN thought.</v>

2863
02:04:29.271 --> 02:04:30.230
<v Speaker 7>She'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>

2864
02:04:30.260 --> 02:04:33.020
<v Speaker 7>Then they wanted to bring her to fucking</v>
<v Speaker 7>Ukraine.</v>

2865
02:04:33.470 --> 02:04:37.980
<v Speaker 7>All other people think that she got</v>
<v Speaker 7>fired from because of that.</v>

2866
02:04:37.980 --> 02:04:41.430
<v Speaker 2>She was there for another year and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>left on her own accord.</v>

2867
02:04:41.640 --> 02:04:43.310
<v Speaker 2>It is kind of crazy that they were</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking of.</v>

2868
02:04:43.470 --> 02:04:45.540
<v Speaker 2>They could just make her go there</v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

2869
02:04:45.900 --> 02:04:46.500
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had an.</v>

2870
02:04:46.500 --> 02:04:48.360
<v Speaker 2>That was funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She woke up that morning and they had</v>

2871
02:04:48.361 --> 02:04:51.420
<v Speaker 2>announced she was going to go toward</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crimea without telling her and she was</v>

2872
02:04:51.421 --> 02:04:52.254
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

2873
02:04:52.290 --> 02:04:56.960
<v Speaker 2>She's like the fuck I am the fuck I am</v>
<v Speaker 2>hilarious.</v>

2874
02:04:57.030 --> 02:04:59.680
<v Speaker 2>Could you imagine if you got up and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>had heard that the,</v>

2875
02:05:00.510 --> 02:05:05.380
<v Speaker 2>the government of Russia had determined</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're going to visit a warzone</v>

2876
02:05:06.070 --> 02:05:07.020
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2877
02:05:07.340 --> 02:05:10.480
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know whether it was a PR person</v>

2878
02:05:10.510 --> 02:05:12.360
<v Speaker 2>thought it'd be a good move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea what happened.</v>

2879
02:05:12.450 --> 02:05:16.290
<v Speaker 2>I bet it came from the top.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think Putin spends his time,</v>

2880
02:05:16.370 --> 02:05:18.540
<v Speaker 2>but he was in the middle of a botox</v>
<v Speaker 2>session.</v>

2881
02:05:18.840 --> 02:05:20.160
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like his mouth,</v>

2882
02:05:20.161 --> 02:05:21.440
<v Speaker 2>his nominees yelling out.</v>

2883
02:05:25.890 --> 02:05:28.050
<v Speaker 2>It's getting botox.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody needs to tell him to stop that</v>

2884
02:05:28.130 --> 02:05:30.960
<v Speaker 2>because he has to stoop fucking rugged</v>
<v Speaker 2>for Botox.</v>

2885
02:05:31.520 --> 02:05:32.353
<v Speaker 2>So let it go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

2886
02:05:32.550 --> 02:05:34.500
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking a lot of the latest Brad</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pitt thing.</v>

2887
02:05:34.501 --> 02:05:37.320
<v Speaker 2>I was wondering if there was some botox,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brad Pitt,</v>

2888
02:05:37.950 --> 02:05:39.690
<v Speaker 2>Brad Pitt was hanging out with Putin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what you're saying?</v>

2889
02:05:39.750 --> 02:05:40.231
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2890
02:05:40.231 --> 02:05:41.450
<v Speaker 2>this is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw a allied.</v>

2891
02:05:41.460 --> 02:05:42.570
<v Speaker 2>It's actually a great movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2892
02:05:42.571 --> 02:05:45.180
<v Speaker 2>his new movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll see some botox and Brad.</v>

2893
02:05:45.860 --> 02:05:47.130
<v Speaker 2>He just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The wrinkles aren't there.</v>

2894
02:05:47.160 --> 02:05:51.320
<v Speaker 2>Something's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something fishy going on and be Angelina</v>

2895
02:05:51.320 --> 02:05:52.590
<v Speaker 2>Jolie's just got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That good</v>

2896
02:05:54.370 --> 02:05:55.560
<v Speaker 2>gives to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stay young.</v>

2897
02:05:55.920 --> 02:05:58.020
<v Speaker 2>They used that CGI stuff for a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

2898
02:05:58.021 --> 02:06:00.750
<v Speaker 2>Now when they're doing Hollywood movies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do they use it throughout the whole</v>

2899
02:06:00.751 --> 02:06:01.410
<v Speaker 2>movie?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2900
02:06:01.410 --> 02:06:04.260
<v Speaker 2>and in lots of cases thought it might</v>
<v Speaker 2>look like that.</v>

2901
02:06:04.380 --> 02:06:05.940
<v Speaker 2>Well maybe that's what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

2902
02:06:05.970 --> 02:06:07.140
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they did that for sure.</v>

2903
02:06:07.140 --> 02:06:09.570
<v Speaker 2>With Westworld,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with Anthony Hopkins.</v>

2904
02:06:09.900 --> 02:06:12.570
<v Speaker 2>Spoiler alert.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's one scene where the show Anthony</v>

2905
02:06:12.570 --> 02:06:16.260
<v Speaker 2>Hopkins back in the day and they stay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have him as you know,</v>

2906
02:06:16.320 --> 02:06:20.040
<v Speaker 2>maybe a man in his fifties instead of in</v>
<v Speaker 2>his sixties and they do a really subtle</v>

2907
02:06:20.041 --> 02:06:24.150
<v Speaker 2>job of CGI and it looks great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing how far away from just like</v>

2908
02:06:24.210 --> 02:06:26.370
<v Speaker 2>dad actors being in movies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2909
02:06:26.371 --> 02:06:29.160
<v Speaker 2>100 percent to is touring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

2910
02:06:29.161 --> 02:06:30.350
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The hologram tour.</v>

2911
02:06:30.351 --> 02:06:31.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2912
02:06:31.770 --> 02:06:34.080
<v Speaker 2>I think um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to have almost an look at</v>

2913
02:06:34.081 --> 02:06:34.914
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>

2914
02:06:35.770 --> 02:06:37.710
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2915
02:06:37.740 --> 02:06:39.810
<v Speaker 2>How do you make them skinnier too?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2916
02:06:39.811 --> 02:06:41.670
<v Speaker 2>they had them not just at this stage</v>
<v Speaker 2>either,</v>

2917
02:06:41.671 --> 02:06:44.010
<v Speaker 2>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had them in more than one stage.</v>

2918
02:06:44.700 --> 02:06:46.650
<v Speaker 2>They had them in a slightly older stage</v>
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>

2919
02:06:47.130 --> 02:06:49.050
<v Speaker 2>It's just a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and do you think the acting,</v>

2920
02:06:49.051 --> 02:06:49.830
<v Speaker 2>the scenes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2921
02:06:49.830 --> 02:06:51.220
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the body,</v>

2922
02:06:51.270 --> 02:06:52.410
<v Speaker 2>did they get a different actor?</v>

2923
02:06:52.410 --> 02:06:54.060
<v Speaker 2>Vaccines?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good question.</v>

2924
02:06:54.090 --> 02:06:55.200
<v Speaker 2>Do they pretty sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2925
02:06:55.201 --> 02:06:57.170
<v Speaker 2>It'd be a different actor and they just</v>
<v Speaker 2>put a different face on.</v>

2926
02:06:57.910 --> 02:06:59.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You remember when they did that with the</v>

2927
02:06:59.431 --> 02:07:01.830
<v Speaker 2>soprano's and it was terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2928
02:07:01.890 --> 02:07:05.970
<v Speaker 2>the mom died and then they did one last</v>
<v Speaker 2>scene with the mom and you're like,</v>

2929
02:07:05.971 --> 02:07:10.050
<v Speaker 2>what in the fuck led you to think that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we would accept this</v>

2930
02:07:11.930 --> 02:07:14.230
<v Speaker 2>was so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was so bad.</v>

2931
02:07:14.231 --> 02:07:15.600
<v Speaker 2>And they only had her in there for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>moment.</v>

2932
02:07:15.601 --> 02:07:18.160
<v Speaker 2>But what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody else's body or head was moving</v>

2933
02:07:18.170 --> 02:07:19.780
<v Speaker 2>weird and just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2934
02:07:19.830 --> 02:07:21.000
<v Speaker 2>here it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Watch it,</v>

2935
02:07:21.050 --> 02:07:21.720
<v Speaker 2>play it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>play it.</v>

2936
02:07:21.720 --> 02:07:22.553
<v Speaker 2>Give us some volume.</v>

2937
02:07:22.650 --> 02:07:27.210
<v Speaker 10>So how's it going?</v>
<v Speaker 10>What are you out of sight out of mind.</v>

2938
02:07:28.680 --> 02:07:29.910
<v Speaker 10>Butch.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Some books on tape,</v>

2939
02:07:29.970 --> 02:07:34.230
<v Speaker 10>but since you say you can't concentrate</v>
<v Speaker 10>to read,</v>

2940
02:07:34.650 --> 02:07:36.040
<v Speaker 10>I wish the Lord would take me</v>

2941
02:07:36.040 --> 02:07:38.050
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was it just using clips from?</v>

2942
02:07:39.010 --> 02:07:40.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's about all I know,</v>

2943
02:07:41.070 --> 02:07:43.750
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought there was A.</v>

2944
02:07:43.750 --> 02:07:46.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm confused.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2945
02:07:46.430 --> 02:07:49.060
<v Speaker 2>maybe this is the same scene,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

2946
02:07:49.070 --> 02:07:50.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those were just clips they had.</v>

2947
02:07:50.710 --> 02:07:51.490
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's not.</v>

2948
02:07:51.490 --> 02:07:54.520
<v Speaker 6>That's not the same scene.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why don't you google,</v>

2949
02:07:54.670 --> 02:07:59.670
<v Speaker 6>what was the mom's name?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fake Cgi mom in the soprano.</v>

2950
02:08:00.230 --> 02:08:01.730
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I'm wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what came up.</v>

2951
02:08:01.740 --> 02:08:03.590
<v Speaker 2>It says it happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I'm wrong,</v>

2952
02:08:03.591 --> 02:08:05.710
<v Speaker 2>but this is just the clip that pops up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2953
02:08:05.720 --> 02:08:07.310
<v Speaker 2>When I saw it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could have swore they had somebody</v>

2954
02:08:07.320 --> 02:08:09.740
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Six insane attempts to make movies</v>

2955
02:08:09.800 --> 02:08:14.740
<v Speaker 2>starting dead movie stars that the next</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing during the sprint is the death of</v>

2956
02:08:14.750 --> 02:08:18.020
<v Speaker 2>Olivia Soprano is the last time you see</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever with poor CGI.</v>

2957
02:08:18.021 --> 02:08:20.300
<v Speaker 2>This foot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That didn't look that bad though.</v>

2958
02:08:21.020 --> 02:08:22.970
<v Speaker 2>Maybe a bit later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And maybe it's just because we're</v>

2959
02:08:22.971 --> 02:08:23.860
<v Speaker 2>looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2960
02:08:23.900 --> 02:08:28.370
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's later in the Clinton</v>
<v Speaker 2>era there were showing her originally</v>

2961
02:08:29.930 --> 02:08:32.600
<v Speaker 2>whatever we lost Gandolfini,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bro.</v>

2962
02:08:33.290 --> 02:08:34.880
<v Speaker 2>That's rough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's rough loss.</v>

2963
02:08:36.830 --> 02:08:37.910
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's just let it go.</v>

2964
02:08:38.150 --> 02:08:41.240
<v Speaker 2>So I'm here that as the cops,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've called them on.</v>

2965
02:08:41.241 --> 02:08:45.100
<v Speaker 2>You decided you a little too divisive</v>
<v Speaker 2>for trump's man.</v>

2966
02:08:45.580 --> 02:08:47.420
<v Speaker 2>They're speaking to the cop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is a story going on right now.</v>

2967
02:08:47.420 --> 02:08:49.500
<v Speaker 2>You guys might be interested in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember the shoe,</v>

2968
02:08:49.520 --> 02:08:52.130
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the shooting of Walter</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scott was his name where the gun was</v>

2969
02:08:52.131 --> 02:08:56.370
<v Speaker 2>planted on the ground by the Cop after</v>
<v Speaker 2>they got to pee.</v>

2970
02:08:56.810 --> 02:08:57.643
<v Speaker 2>Pee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2971
02:08:57.780 --> 02:08:58.613
<v Speaker 2>Nabil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2972
02:08:58.660 --> 02:09:03.500
<v Speaker 2>No ears.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The cases going on right now,</v>

2973
02:09:03.501 --> 02:09:05.060
<v Speaker 2>and I guess they almost have a hung</v>
<v Speaker 2>jury,</v>

2974
02:09:05.061 --> 02:09:07.430
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the judge is telling them to go</v>

2975
02:09:07.431 --> 02:09:09.740
<v Speaker 2>back and deliberate and figure out how</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can handle it,</v>

2976
02:09:09.741 --> 02:09:11.330
<v Speaker 2>but they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're trying to get out of it.</v>

2977
02:09:11.570 --> 02:09:14.630
<v Speaker 2>So this is the one where the guy shot</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guys who was running away and then</v>

2978
02:09:14.631 --> 02:09:18.230
<v Speaker 2>through a gun on the ground and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>could see it clearly in 55 witnesses</v>

2979
02:09:18.231 --> 02:09:20.480
<v Speaker 2>gave testimony in the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

2980
02:09:22.700 --> 02:09:26.570
<v Speaker 2>what is there to deliberate on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll find out shortly.</v>

2981
02:09:26.630 --> 02:09:30.350
<v Speaker 2>They fucking shot the guy in the back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We watched it on video and not only</v>

2982
02:09:30.351 --> 02:09:32.960
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>planted a gun and then drop the gun.</v>

2983
02:09:34.090 --> 02:09:36.920
<v Speaker 2>Scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

2984
02:09:37.040 --> 02:09:40.100
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing is like if the cubs</v>
<v Speaker 2>want us to respect them,</v>

2985
02:09:40.101 --> 02:09:43.130
<v Speaker 2>they've got to go after bad cops.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They never fucking do all these guys get</v>

2986
02:09:43.131 --> 02:09:43.640
<v Speaker 2>off.</v>

2987
02:09:43.640 --> 02:09:44.630
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They have this,</v>

2988
02:09:44.631 --> 02:09:45.201
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

2989
02:09:45.201 --> 02:09:49.250
<v Speaker 6>I mean some cops that go after,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like that one woman who shot that guy</v>

2990
02:09:49.670 --> 02:09:52.730
<v Speaker 6>who remember that he got tasered.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then she shot him on the highway.</v>

2991
02:09:52.760 --> 02:09:53.990
<v Speaker 6>He was a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he turned around.</v>

2992
02:09:53.991 --> 02:09:56.220
<v Speaker 6>He wasn't listening to them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He went and got back into his car.</v>

2993
02:09:56.221 --> 02:10:00.650
<v Speaker 6>They said he was on PCP.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Remember that what I had heard from</v>

2994
02:10:00.651 --> 02:10:05.651
<v Speaker 6>someone is in the tactical community was</v>
<v Speaker 6>that she made the gigantic error of</v>

2995
02:10:05.901 --> 02:10:08.600
<v Speaker 6>keeping our finger on the trigger and</v>
<v Speaker 6>that she wasn't doing anything.</v>

2996
02:10:08.620 --> 02:10:10.690
<v Speaker 6>She was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're supposed to have total finger</v>

2997
02:10:10.820 --> 02:10:15.800
<v Speaker 6>finger off the trigger because when the</v>
<v Speaker 6>guy got tasered by the other gentleman,</v>

2998
02:10:15.890 --> 02:10:18.740
<v Speaker 6>the other cop,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she like reacted to it and pulled the</v>

2999
02:10:18.741 --> 02:10:21.140
<v Speaker 6>trigger.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This guy in the tactical community said,</v>

3000
02:10:21.141 --> 02:10:24.390
<v Speaker 6>it happens all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's why you have to have trigger</v>

3001
02:10:24.391 --> 02:10:27.950
<v Speaker 6>control because you don't even realize</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're doing it because you're reacting</v>

3002
02:10:27.951 --> 02:10:29.670
<v Speaker 6>to a violent moments.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Your muscles,</v>

3003
02:10:30.110 --> 02:10:32.270
<v Speaker 6>whole lot.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You have your finger on the trigger and</v>

3004
02:10:32.271 --> 02:10:33.980
<v Speaker 6>then something violent happens and you</v>

3005
02:10:33.980 --> 02:10:37.130
<v Speaker 4>just do that and you shoot them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's what happened according to</v>

3006
02:10:37.131 --> 02:10:38.510
<v Speaker 4>him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if that's true,</v>

3007
02:10:39.290 --> 02:10:41.810
<v Speaker 4>but I could totally see that I to fuck</v>
<v Speaker 4>that job.</v>

3008
02:10:41.811 --> 02:10:43.370
<v Speaker 4>Lee Camp,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3009
02:10:44.190 --> 02:10:47.250
<v Speaker 5>I did there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think they're told that they had guns.</v>

3010
02:10:47.251 --> 02:10:49.890
<v Speaker 5>Are that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that pulling out the gun is going to</v>

3011
02:10:49.891 --> 02:10:52.120
<v Speaker 5>solve the situation usually and it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking,</v>

3012
02:10:52.121 --> 02:10:53.640
<v Speaker 5>it makes it worse half the time.</v>

3013
02:10:55.050 --> 02:10:57.610
<v Speaker 4>Half the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it was the other time.</v>

3014
02:10:57.611 --> 02:11:00.250
<v Speaker 4>It's perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fucking.</v>

3015
02:11:00.251 --> 02:11:01.084
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shoot away,</v>

3016
02:11:01.480 --> 02:11:01.871
<v Speaker 4>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bang,</v>

3017
02:11:01.871 --> 02:11:03.980
<v Speaker 4>Bang.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You leave it up to them to decide when's</v>

3018
02:11:04.010 --> 02:11:07.150
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you do your show,</v>

3019
02:11:07.740 --> 02:11:11.110
<v Speaker 4>I'm on our team.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do they have guidelines for you?</v>

3020
02:11:11.111 --> 02:11:15.360
<v Speaker 4>How much control you have over,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what kind of stuff you do have to</v>

3021
02:11:15.370 --> 02:11:16.203
<v Speaker 4>work with?</v>

3022
02:11:16.270 --> 02:11:17.450
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no we have,</v>

3023
02:11:17.460 --> 02:11:19.520
<v Speaker 5>we have a meeting with the news director</v>
<v Speaker 5>but uh,</v>

3024
02:11:19.720 --> 02:11:20.920
<v Speaker 5>once a week.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But uh,</v>

3025
02:11:21.010 --> 02:11:23.140
<v Speaker 5>I write all my own stuff and it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>really,</v>

3026
02:11:23.520 --> 02:11:24.353
<v Speaker 5>it's really pretty cool.</v>

3027
02:11:24.400 --> 02:11:27.340
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What other network or give you that kind</v>

3028
02:11:27.341 --> 02:11:28.630
<v Speaker 4>of freedom.</v>

3029
02:11:29.120 --> 02:11:30.860
<v Speaker 5>And here's the thing though,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is is,</v>

3030
02:11:31.190 --> 02:11:33.950
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just figured like the one thing I</v>

3031
02:11:33.951 --> 02:11:38.951
<v Speaker 5>actually do just kind of avoid</v>
<v Speaker 5>intentionally is saying nice things</v>

3032
02:11:39.051 --> 02:11:41.510
<v Speaker 5>about Russia because I know everyone's</v>
<v Speaker 5>going to think I was put up to it,</v>

3033
02:11:41.660 --> 02:11:42.980
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I haven't been.</v>

3034
02:11:42.981 --> 02:11:45.500
<v Speaker 5>But I just know that's what people would</v>
<v Speaker 5>accuse me of.</v>

3035
02:11:45.660 --> 02:11:49.650
<v Speaker 4>So do you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you find it amazing when you look</v>

3036
02:11:49.651 --> 02:11:54.210
<v Speaker 4>around in 2016,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is a country like Korea where</v>

3037
02:11:54.211 --> 02:11:58.740
<v Speaker 4>you're completely divided and one side</v>
<v Speaker 4>is kind of American,</v>

3038
02:11:58.741 --> 02:12:01.020
<v Speaker 4>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one side South Korea.</v>

3039
02:12:01.220 --> 02:12:06.220
<v Speaker 4>And then the other side is an insane</v>
<v Speaker 4>dictatorship and they live right next</v>

3040
02:12:07.441 --> 02:12:11.640
<v Speaker 4>door and they look alike and they were</v>
<v Speaker 4>once one country.</v>

3041
02:12:12.210 --> 02:12:14.940
<v Speaker 4>And this is how it could go bad and this</v>
<v Speaker 4>how can go good?</v>

3042
02:12:14.990 --> 02:12:18.530
<v Speaker 5>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's a fucking major problem in</v>

3043
02:12:18.531 --> 02:12:20.580
<v Speaker 5>the way we discuss these things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the way we talk to each other,</v>

3044
02:12:20.581 --> 02:12:23.360
<v Speaker 5>the way we view the world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that we start to think of people as</v>

3045
02:12:23.361 --> 02:12:25.940
<v Speaker 5>their leader.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like people thought all Americans.</v>

3046
02:12:25.941 --> 02:12:28.820
<v Speaker 5>Where George Bush,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people think all Russians are Putin.</v>

3047
02:12:29.060 --> 02:12:32.120
<v Speaker 5>It's like this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The leaders that are fucking crazy,</v>

3048
02:12:32.650 --> 02:12:35.270
<v Speaker 5>it's like if you go fucking chat with a</v>
<v Speaker 5>Russian guy,</v>

3049
02:12:35.600 --> 02:12:37.220
<v Speaker 5>you're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're gonna love the dude.</v>

3050
02:12:37.221 --> 02:12:39.020
<v Speaker 5>Like probably like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was like,</v>

3051
02:12:39.140 --> 02:12:41.810
<v Speaker 5>it's like everybody around the world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're not our leaders,</v>

3052
02:12:41.811 --> 02:12:42.950
<v Speaker 5>we're not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3053
02:12:43.480 --> 02:12:44.530
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

3054
02:12:44.610 --> 02:12:47.210
<v Speaker 5>the Brits aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're crazy leader and the vus</v>

3055
02:12:47.211 --> 02:12:48.980
<v Speaker 5>trillions aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're crazy leader and it's like</v>

3056
02:12:48.981 --> 02:12:50.450
<v Speaker 5>people are their own people.</v>

3057
02:12:51.510 --> 02:12:53.250
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's one of the reasons why having a</v>

3058
02:12:53.251 --> 02:12:55.980
<v Speaker 4>president in the first place is kinda</v>
<v Speaker 4>ridiculous.</v>

3059
02:12:56.280 --> 02:12:58.450
<v Speaker 4>Having one alpha person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3060
02:12:58.680 --> 02:13:01.950
<v Speaker 4>Male or female running the whole show is</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of a figurehead.</v>

3061
02:13:02.510 --> 02:13:03.910
<v Speaker 4>Kind of preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3062
02:13:07.270 --> 02:13:08.820
<v Speaker 4>Bizarre that we still do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>

3063
02:13:08.900 --> 02:13:12.430
<v Speaker 4>it's even more bizarre that someone can</v>
<v Speaker 4>still pull off a dictatorship,</v>

3064
02:13:13.920 --> 02:13:14.641
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in Korea.</v>

3065
02:13:14.641 --> 02:13:17.190
<v Speaker 4>Like how does Korea and that's the big</v>
<v Speaker 4>one.</v>

3066
02:13:17.220 --> 02:13:19.440
<v Speaker 4>Like how does North Korea and how does</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

3067
02:13:19.710 --> 02:13:23.070
<v Speaker 4>how does that ever resolve itself?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have no idea.</v>

3068
02:13:23.250 --> 02:13:26.370
<v Speaker 4>They're so deep in 2016,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so locked in.</v>

3069
02:13:28.290 --> 02:13:30.860
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just people don't want to think that I</v>

3070
02:13:30.861 --> 02:13:31.890
<v Speaker 4>could ever happen here</v>

3071
02:13:32.350 --> 02:13:35.310
<v Speaker 7>and it might not.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It absolutely could happen.</v>

3072
02:13:36.270 --> 02:13:37.680
<v Speaker 7>And the other thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3073
02:13:37.681 --> 02:13:40.250
<v Speaker 7>in a certain way it's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's the best kind of slavery is you</v>

3074
02:13:40.251 --> 02:13:42.750
<v Speaker 7>don't know you're a slave.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So if you spend your whole life trying</v>

3075
02:13:42.751 --> 02:13:46.230
<v Speaker 7>to work off student debt and jobs you</v>
<v Speaker 7>hate,</v>

3076
02:13:46.630 --> 02:13:48.300
<v Speaker 7>it's like that's kind of slave.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You don't know.</v>

3077
02:13:48.310 --> 02:13:51.480
<v Speaker 7>Your sleeve.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Cut to headline says Lee camp says Korea</v>

3078
02:13:51.481 --> 02:13:54.630
<v Speaker 7>is better than.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

3079
02:13:54.760 --> 02:13:57.000
<v Speaker 7>I'm not saying that Korea is fucking</v>
<v Speaker 7>awful.</v>

3080
02:13:57.450 --> 02:14:01.890
<v Speaker 7>Jesus though he can't points to</v>
<v Speaker 7>different type of slavery that makes</v>

3081
02:14:01.891 --> 02:14:06.480
<v Speaker 7>America worse than everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

3082
02:14:07.280 --> 02:14:08.250
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's.</v>

3083
02:14:08.360 --> 02:14:09.700
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the worst.</v>

3084
02:14:11.410 --> 02:14:13.110
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Russia is a little spooky.</v>

3085
02:14:13.920 --> 02:14:14.850
<v Speaker 2>Putin's a little spooky.</v>

3086
02:14:16.950 --> 02:14:20.000
<v Speaker 7>Jack and</v>
<v Speaker 7>Jack and people</v>

3087
02:14:20.290 --> 02:14:24.250
<v Speaker 2>gangster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean allegedly were blowing people up.</v>

3088
02:14:24.460 --> 02:14:25.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're doing that too.</v>

3089
02:14:27.080 --> 02:14:28.990
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know either.</v>

3090
02:14:29.560 --> 02:14:31.360
<v Speaker 2>I just know you can't talk about a</v>
<v Speaker 2>proper right now.</v>

3091
02:14:31.650 --> 02:14:35.110
<v Speaker 2>I made you uncomfortable talking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>something better.</v>

3092
02:14:35.260 --> 02:14:36.450
<v Speaker 2>China.</v>
<v Speaker 2>China's fuck drop,</v>

3093
02:14:36.460 --> 02:14:38.580
<v Speaker 2>right bro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's that?</v>

3094
02:14:38.640 --> 02:14:39.880
<v Speaker 2>I said China's fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bro.</v>

3095
02:14:39.960 --> 02:14:41.740
<v Speaker 2>I don't know much about him either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't either.</v>

3096
02:14:41.860 --> 02:14:43.410
<v Speaker 2>That's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a.</v>

3097
02:14:43.510 --> 02:14:47.140
<v Speaker 2>it's just amazing how I couldn't even</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell you this is.</v>

3098
02:14:47.710 --> 02:14:49.870
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't admit this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't even tell you China's leader</v>

3099
02:14:49.871 --> 02:14:51.220
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have a leader.</v>

3100
02:14:52.720 --> 02:14:54.820
<v Speaker 2>China's president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think it would be president</v>

3101
02:14:54.880 --> 02:14:58.100
<v Speaker 2>or would it be an emperor?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No</v>

3102
02:14:59.740 --> 02:15:01.240
<v Speaker 2>president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know his name.</v>

3103
02:15:01.980 --> 02:15:03.310
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does Canada have again?</v>

3104
02:15:03.550 --> 02:15:08.550
<v Speaker 2>They have a uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well they have prime minister say that's</v>

3105
02:15:09.430 --> 02:15:12.370
<v Speaker 2>so fucking high and Tati Trudeau.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3106
02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:16.620
<v Speaker 2>That's the dude trying to president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that how you say z?</v>

3107
02:15:16.680 --> 02:15:17.620
<v Speaker 2>Z?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jin Ping.</v>

3108
02:15:18.570 --> 02:15:22.030
<v Speaker 2>It looks trustworthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like him like we're doing a good job.</v>

3109
02:15:22.370 --> 02:15:25.510
<v Speaker 2>They're doing a good job over there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine running a billion people.</v>

3110
02:15:26.650 --> 02:15:29.650
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a crazy country,</v>

3111
02:15:29.660 --> 02:15:31.080
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen this?</v>

3112
02:15:31.770 --> 02:15:32.603
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have not.</v>

3113
02:15:32.920 --> 02:15:35.020
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen the cities that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>recreate in China?</v>

3114
02:15:35.470 --> 02:15:38.080
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the ghost cities that just recreate</v>

3115
02:15:38.081 --> 02:15:38.321
<v Speaker 7>that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's,</v>

3116
02:15:38.321 --> 02:15:39.250
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>These are two separate things,</v>

3117
02:15:39.251 --> 02:15:40.660
<v Speaker 7>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they'll recreate where it's just like</v>

3118
02:15:40.661 --> 02:15:41.320
<v Speaker 7>Paris,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

3119
02:15:41.320 --> 02:15:43.870
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>People just go there for our honeymoon</v>

3120
02:15:43.871 --> 02:15:46.240
<v Speaker 7>and everything's empty.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's nuts.</v>

3121
02:15:46.830 --> 02:15:49.120
<v Speaker 7>They recreate the old city.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's nuts.</v>

3122
02:15:49.390 --> 02:15:52.180
<v Speaker 7>And the part of the reason they do that</v>
<v Speaker 7>is because they have these ghost cities</v>

3123
02:15:52.240 --> 02:15:55.180
<v Speaker 7>and it's because GDP measures production</v>
<v Speaker 7>partially.</v>

3124
02:15:55.380 --> 02:15:58.630
<v Speaker 7>And so to keep their GDP up,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they just build ghost cities.</v>

3125
02:15:58.660 --> 02:15:59.530
<v Speaker 7>Like fucking no one lives there.</v>

3126
02:16:00.420 --> 02:16:01.570
<v Speaker 2>That's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's nuts.</v>

3127
02:16:01.571 --> 02:16:06.571
<v Speaker 2>Vice did a thing on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now as a comic who also has a show and</v>

3128
02:16:07.271 --> 02:16:09.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're this sort of observer of the</v>

3129
02:16:09.251 --> 02:16:11.410
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you have to look at the world more</v>

3130
02:16:11.411 --> 02:16:12.244
<v Speaker 2>than you would like?</v>

3131
02:16:13.820 --> 02:16:15.470
<v Speaker 7>Do I have to look at the world?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

3132
02:16:15.500 --> 02:16:18.770
<v Speaker 7>like all the crazy chaos that you have</v>
<v Speaker 7>to kind of focus on or you just show and</v>

3133
02:16:18.771 --> 02:16:19.990
<v Speaker 7>doing standup.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>

3134
02:16:20.030 --> 02:16:22.690
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I view my life because I'm,</v>

3135
02:16:23.270 --> 02:16:26.120
<v Speaker 7>I've always focused on America just</v>
<v Speaker 7>simply because I'm an American in</v>

3136
02:16:26.121 --> 02:16:30.280
<v Speaker 7>America talking about American issues</v>
<v Speaker 7>and I don't honestly not educated well</v>

3137
02:16:30.281 --> 02:16:31.720
<v Speaker 7>on world issues.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like I said,</v>

3138
02:16:31.721 --> 02:16:34.470
<v Speaker 7>I couldn't tell you certain leaders of</v>
<v Speaker 7>countries and so to me it,</v>

3139
02:16:34.540 --> 02:16:38.170
<v Speaker 7>it comes from a place of ignorance.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like I don't know if I want to rant</v>

3140
02:16:38.171 --> 02:16:40.450
<v Speaker 7>and rave about something I don't know</v>
<v Speaker 7>the truth about.</v>

3141
02:16:40.840 --> 02:16:43.450
<v Speaker 7>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so I definitely stick to the American</v>

3142
02:16:43.451 --> 02:16:45.040
<v Speaker 7>issues,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but in terms of having to focus on the</v>

3143
02:16:45.041 --> 02:16:46.930
<v Speaker 7>chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 7>do they can get depressing to focus on</v>

3144
02:16:46.931 --> 02:16:49.300
<v Speaker 7>all the chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 7>to focus on the fucking protesters being</v>

3145
02:16:49.301 --> 02:16:51.790
<v Speaker 7>brutalized in standing rock.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It gets exhausting.</v>

3146
02:16:51.940 --> 02:16:54.790
<v Speaker 7>Do you throw in the occasional cute</v>
<v Speaker 7>kitten story?</v>

3147
02:16:55.380 --> 02:16:56.540
<v Speaker 7>Make things better?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh yeah.</v>

3148
02:16:57.080 --> 02:16:59.980
<v Speaker 7>What can you throw in kittens?</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's not a weird thing about the news</v>

3149
02:16:59.981 --> 02:17:02.290
<v Speaker 7>though.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I did one where I literally wish I just</v>

3150
02:17:02.291 --> 02:17:05.980
<v Speaker 7>showed puppy dogs over my shoulder as I</v>
<v Speaker 7>talked about it just to like show people</v>

3151
02:17:05.981 --> 02:17:10.390
<v Speaker 7>how do you feel a responsibility to show</v>
<v Speaker 7>people all of a sudden this become an</v>

3152
02:17:10.391 --> 02:17:12.340
<v Speaker 7>interview.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Try not to do those.</v>

3153
02:17:12.341 --> 02:17:15.710
<v Speaker 7>But I am curious about like what's like</v>
<v Speaker 7>to put together a show the jurors?</v>

3154
02:17:15.950 --> 02:17:16.783
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Every week.</v>

3155
02:17:16.810 --> 02:17:18.430
<v Speaker 7>Every week.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Do you feel like any sort of</v>

3156
02:17:18.431 --> 02:17:22.800
<v Speaker 7>responsibility to like for your content?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like you have a platform and I feel</v>

3157
02:17:22.810 --> 02:17:26.380
<v Speaker 7>responsibility to not be too depressing</v>
<v Speaker 7>but not per story.</v>

3158
02:17:26.381 --> 02:17:27.040
<v Speaker 7>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'll,</v>

3159
02:17:27.040 --> 02:17:29.240
<v Speaker 7>I'll cover fucking depressing shit,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I,</v>

3160
02:17:29.480 --> 02:17:32.110
<v Speaker 7>I do feel a responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like in the sense of I don't think</v>

3161
02:17:32.111 --> 02:17:35.590
<v Speaker 7>people are going to keep watching,</v>
<v Speaker 7>nor will they feel active to create</v>

3162
02:17:35.591 --> 02:17:37.000
<v Speaker 7>change if they're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>ah,</v>

3163
02:17:37.001 --> 02:17:38.200
<v Speaker 7>it's all fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Fuck it.</v>

3164
02:17:39.130 --> 02:17:39.970
<v Speaker 7>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so I,</v>

3165
02:17:40.060 --> 02:17:42.940
<v Speaker 7>I do try not to get too much on that</v>
<v Speaker 7>side of things.</v>

3166
02:17:43.710 --> 02:17:44.380
<v Speaker 7>That's all</v>

3167
02:17:44.380 --> 02:17:48.430
<v Speaker 6>logical but super depressing perspective</v>
<v Speaker 6>that it's all fucked.</v>

3168
02:17:48.431 --> 02:17:50.560
<v Speaker 6>Fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's logic.</v>

3169
02:17:50.561 --> 02:17:52.360
<v Speaker 6>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know why you would think that way.</v>

3170
02:17:52.361 --> 02:17:53.200
<v Speaker 6>But God,</v>

3171
02:17:53.670 --> 02:17:54.990
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think there's a lot of people to think</v>

3172
02:17:54.991 --> 02:17:56.390
<v Speaker 7>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Sure.</v>

<v Speaker 7>idea.</v>

3193
02:18:42.620 --> 02:18:44.870
<v Speaker 7>And especially with people like you said</v>
<v Speaker 7>earlier that they're,</v>

3194
02:18:44.890 --> 02:18:46.760
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>working three jobs trying to feed the</v>

3195
02:18:46.880 --> 02:18:48.260
<v Speaker 7>fucking family.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>

3196
02:18:48.320 --> 02:18:51.740
<v Speaker 7>of course they don't have time to give a</v>
<v Speaker 7>shit about five states over.</v>

3197
02:18:51.741 --> 02:18:54.170
<v Speaker 7>These people are being brutalized.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like yeah,</v>

3198
02:18:54.260 --> 02:18:55.940
<v Speaker 7>it's too hard.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's too hard to think about those</v>

3199
02:18:55.941 --> 02:18:57.410
<v Speaker 7>people in North Dakota,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you don't know them,</v>

3200
02:18:58.590 --> 02:18:59.570
<v Speaker 7>but.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But we have,</v>

3201
02:18:59.571 --> 02:19:04.571
<v Speaker 7>we have also created a culture that is</v>
<v Speaker 7>distinctly like good at getting people</v>

3202
02:19:04.701 --> 02:19:09.701
<v Speaker 7>to ignore what really matters.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Just like we're just under a swamp of</v>

3203
02:19:11.001 --> 02:19:16.001
<v Speaker 7>bullshit to actually pay attention to,</v>
<v Speaker 7>to important stories.</v>

3204
02:19:16.700 --> 02:19:21.700
<v Speaker 6>You think that that is by design or do</v>
<v Speaker 6>you think that that is just what we were</v>

3205
02:19:22.121 --> 02:19:24.460
<v Speaker 6>paying attention to it?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like we pay attention to nonsense,</v>

3206
02:19:24.461 --> 02:19:27.740
<v Speaker 6>celebrity gossip,</v>
<v Speaker 6>stuff like Brad Pitt and getting</v>

3207
02:19:27.741 --> 02:19:28.370
<v Speaker 6>divorced</v>

3208
02:19:28.370 --> 02:19:29.080
<v Speaker 4>and I think it's good</v>

3209
02:19:29.080 --> 02:19:32.680
<v Speaker 5>combination of bydesign and just what</v>
<v Speaker 5>gets ratings.</v>

3210
02:19:32.681 --> 02:19:35.860
<v Speaker 5>You're going to get more ratings by</v>
<v Speaker 5>covering trump,</v>

3211
02:19:35.861 --> 02:19:37.390
<v Speaker 5>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or his twitter war.</v>

3212
02:19:37.391 --> 02:19:42.391
<v Speaker 5>Then you are going to get with like the</v>
<v Speaker 5>details of how these people are having a</v>

3213
02:19:42.641 --> 02:19:45.310
<v Speaker 5>really hard time because they were</v>
<v Speaker 5>kicked out of their home by the bank or</v>

3214
02:19:45.311 --> 02:19:47.740
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So part of it is ratings,</v>

3215
02:19:47.741 --> 02:19:50.800
<v Speaker 5>but part of it is by design.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean the fact that occupied got very</v>

3216
02:19:50.801 --> 02:19:52.960
<v Speaker 5>little mainstream media coverage was by</v>
<v Speaker 5>design.</v>

3217
02:19:52.961 --> 02:19:56.410
<v Speaker 5>It was like if we cover this as an</v>
<v Speaker 5>important thing,</v>

3218
02:19:56.530 --> 02:19:59.140
<v Speaker 5>it's going to grow bigger and we're</v>
<v Speaker 5>going to fuel it.</v>

3219
02:20:00.390 --> 02:20:01.910
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No shit man.</v>

3220
02:20:03.770 --> 02:20:04.603
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

3221
02:20:06.470 --> 02:20:10.760
<v Speaker 4>it's interesting because the things that</v>
<v Speaker 4>we do get obsessed with that are</v>

3222
02:20:10.761 --> 02:20:13.280
<v Speaker 4>ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that take up so much of our time that</v>

3223
02:20:13.281 --> 02:20:15.200
<v Speaker 4>really mean nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3224
02:20:16.250 --> 02:20:18.500
<v Speaker 4>when you look at all the stuff that we</v>
<v Speaker 4>do ignore,</v>

3225
02:20:19.310 --> 02:20:22.250
<v Speaker 4>you don't like the guy that got iced</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was under FBI care,</v>

3226
02:20:22.310 --> 02:20:23.150
<v Speaker 4>like that never,</v>
<v Speaker 4>never,</v>

3227
02:20:23.180 --> 02:20:25.820
<v Speaker 4>never gets talked about whether or not</v>
<v Speaker 4>you agree with that.</v>

3228
02:20:25.870 --> 02:20:29.000
<v Speaker 4>Whether it should have shot him or not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're allowed to execute people now</v>

3229
02:20:29.350 --> 02:20:30.480
<v Speaker 4>because that was going on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3230
02:20:30.481 --> 02:20:32.510
<v Speaker 4>That that might be a big issue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We should probably discuss it.</v>

3231
02:20:32.570 --> 02:20:34.910
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's just one,</v>

3232
02:20:34.911 --> 02:20:36.470
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a million different stories.</v>

3233
02:20:36.500 --> 02:20:39.410
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing that the standing rock</v>
<v Speaker 4>stories become as big as it is really</v>

3234
02:20:39.820 --> 02:20:42.960
<v Speaker 5>because they'll all that and Bernie</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sanders and all that.</v>

3235
02:20:42.961 --> 02:20:46.540
<v Speaker 5>Like any black lives matter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like the only reason,</v>

3236
02:20:46.541 --> 02:20:48.180
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not saying everyone's gotTa love</v>

3237
02:20:48.181 --> 02:20:51.810
<v Speaker 5>Bernie or agree with all that shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'm saying I'm saying the fact that</v>

3238
02:20:51.811 --> 02:20:55.080
<v Speaker 5>those guys as big as they are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's all because of citizen journalism</v>

3239
02:20:55.081 --> 02:20:57.420
<v Speaker 5>and and social media and all that stuff.</v>

3240
02:20:57.530 --> 02:21:00.140
<v Speaker 4>The Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ability to make your own new site.</v>

3241
02:21:00.490 --> 02:21:02.270
<v Speaker 4>I mean new sites or.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3242
02:21:02.340 --> 02:21:05.480
<v Speaker 4>this is all you need is a website.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The gatekeepers are gone.</v>

3243
02:21:06.140 --> 02:21:08.900
<v Speaker 4>Not only the gone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like the amount of people that pay</v>

3244
02:21:08.901 --> 02:21:13.340
<v Speaker 4>attention to certain alternative media</v>
<v Speaker 4>sources far exceeds what you get an a</v>

3245
02:21:13.341 --> 02:21:17.580
<v Speaker 4>daily episode of the bill o'reilly show,</v>

3489
02:32:12.100 --> 02:32:13.530
<v Speaker 4>It was just money.</v>

<v Speaker 4>a physical stunt and the father was kind</v>

3546
02:34:51.761 --> 02:34:54.150

<v Speaker 2>I really do believe that places hold a</v>

3548
02:34:56.750 --> 02:34:59.050
<v Speaker 2>feeling [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3549
02:34:59.800 --> 02:35:04.210
<v Speaker 2>like I'd never been to a place where</v>
<v Speaker 2>like who knows how many thousands of</v>

3550
02:35:04.211 --> 02:35:07.660
<v Speaker 2>animals have died if not maybe a million</v>
<v Speaker 2>or maybe even more.</v>

3551
02:35:07.720 --> 02:35:08.980
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how long had it been around</v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

3552
02:35:09.190 --> 02:35:12.220
<v Speaker 2>but it was a like a legit big time</v>
<v Speaker 2>slaughterhouse.</v>

3553
02:35:12.610 --> 02:35:16.960
<v Speaker 2>Was there a slaughtering going on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not what that we saw but very recently</v>

3554
02:35:17.500 --> 02:35:21.490
<v Speaker 2>because we had to do the scene with</v>
<v Speaker 2>blood and when you have blood you have</v>

3555
02:35:21.491 --> 02:35:25.120
<v Speaker 2>to keep it very cold and you can only</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep it that way for a short amount of</v>

3556
02:35:25.121 --> 02:35:28.870
<v Speaker 2>time because it could get go bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can get sick from it because these</v>

3557
02:35:28.871 --> 02:35:32.260
<v Speaker 2>people have to dunk their head into this</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff so they have goggles on and they</v>

3558
02:35:32.261 --> 02:35:35.350
<v Speaker 2>have to dunk their headed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're bobbing in this freezing cold</v>

3559
02:35:35.380 --> 02:35:38.380
<v Speaker 2>blood so you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your body doesn't want to do it because</v>

3560
02:35:38.381 --> 02:35:40.650
<v Speaker 2>it's so goddamn cold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine the number of lawyers involved</v>

3561
02:35:41.260 --> 02:35:42.970
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's while this is going on,</v>

3562
02:35:42.971 --> 02:35:46.600
<v Speaker 2>there's a guy who's about to do the show</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's outside and he's talking to</v>

3563
02:35:46.601 --> 02:35:50.160
<v Speaker 2>himself in the side mirror of a truck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got like one of those side mirrors.</v>

3564
02:35:50.180 --> 02:35:53.050
<v Speaker 2>That truck is not his truck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's a competitor so he's like,</v>

3565
02:35:53.051 --> 02:35:55.060
<v Speaker 2>you found a mirror and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are a winner.</v>

3566
02:35:55.240 --> 02:35:57.910
<v Speaker 2>You are not a loser.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You will succeed.</v>

3567
02:35:58.090 --> 02:36:01.690
<v Speaker 2>You will follow through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You will get it done and he's like doing</v>

3568
02:36:01.691 --> 02:36:04.860
<v Speaker 2>all this stuff and he just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's doing like little sprints.</v>

3569
02:36:04.920 --> 02:36:08.170
<v Speaker 2>The same thing Ted Cruz's kids say to</v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves before they talked to him</v>

3570
02:36:08.320 --> 02:36:11.240
<v Speaker 2>probably will follow through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can talk to.</v>

3571
02:36:12.170 --> 02:36:14.610
<v Speaker 2>You will talk to Dad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dad,</v>

3572
02:36:14.611 --> 02:36:15.444
<v Speaker 2>I'm gay.</v>

3573
02:36:20.260 --> 02:36:23.140
<v Speaker 2>Anything else?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can't do anything to add now.</v>

3574
02:36:23.170 --> 02:36:25.000
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard something about a,</v>

3575
02:36:25.120 --> 02:36:27.430
<v Speaker 2>a this American life went into a</v>
<v Speaker 2>slaughter house,</v>

3576
02:36:27.431 --> 02:36:28.910
<v Speaker 2>like a pig slaughter house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was Waldo.</v>

3577
02:36:29.050 --> 02:36:34.050
<v Speaker 2>It was while it was going on and like</v>
<v Speaker 2>two of them left mid segment and went</v>

3578
02:36:35.711 --> 02:36:39.760
<v Speaker 2>and vomited outside and then like it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>madness.</v>

3579
02:36:40.300 --> 02:36:43.300
<v Speaker 2>Well that's one of those things like</v>
<v Speaker 2>many things in our culture,</v>

3580
02:36:43.330 --> 02:36:45.040
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like prisons that we were talking about</v>

3581
02:36:45.041 --> 02:36:46.720
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how did it get to this point</v>

3582
02:36:46.900 --> 02:36:50.110
<v Speaker 2>because we kind of realized it was at</v>
<v Speaker 2>this point as adults.</v>

3583
02:36:50.410 --> 02:36:52.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you remember the day that you became</v>

3584
02:36:52.301 --> 02:36:55.000
<v Speaker 2>aware of factory farming?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were probably a grown adult.</v>

3585
02:36:55.090 --> 02:36:55.681
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we,</v>

3586
02:36:55.681 --> 02:36:58.030
<v Speaker 2>we habituate to these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We get used to them.</v>

3587
02:36:58.031 --> 02:37:00.430
<v Speaker 2>We're just accustomed to like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like it's slowly,</v>

3588
02:37:00.431 --> 02:37:03.790
<v Speaker 2>we're accustomed to so many people being</v>
<v Speaker 2>in prison and just slowly grows and we</v>

3589
02:37:03.791 --> 02:37:07.300
<v Speaker 2>slowly accept it and we sold the except</v>
<v Speaker 2>the invasion of privacy.</v>

3590
02:37:07.300 --> 02:37:09.520
<v Speaker 2>It used to be without anyone watching</v>
<v Speaker 2>your email,</v>

3591
02:37:09.521 --> 02:37:11.460
<v Speaker 2>we people would talk about they were</v>
<v Speaker 2>upset.</v>

3592
02:37:11.750 --> 02:37:15.560
<v Speaker 2>Now it's like everyone assumes and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same thing can be said about factory</v>

3593
02:37:15.561 --> 02:37:18.260
<v Speaker 2>farming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the immediate answer as well.</v>

3594
02:37:18.261 --> 02:37:20.420
<v Speaker 2>Offering up a solution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no solutions were.</v>

3595
02:37:20.421 --> 02:37:22.130
<v Speaker 2>What about the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need the numbers.</v>

3596
02:37:22.131 --> 02:37:24.500
<v Speaker 2>We need the numbers of Burgers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we need the numbers of chicken.</v>

3597
02:37:25.400 --> 02:37:26.720
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3598
02:37:27.600 --> 02:37:28.460
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

3599
02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:31.430
<v Speaker 2>we've really painted ourselves into a</v>
<v Speaker 2>strange corner here.</v>

3600
02:37:31.760 --> 02:37:33.100
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no reason that you know,</v>

3601
02:37:33.140 --> 02:37:35.390
<v Speaker 2>hamburger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mcdonald's will be cheaper than like a</v>

3602
02:37:35.391 --> 02:37:40.040
<v Speaker 2>thing of Broccoli at the store.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like we're just subsidizing this</v>

3603
02:37:40.070 --> 02:37:42.300
<v Speaker 2>massive meat intake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3604
02:37:42.620 --> 02:37:44.540
<v Speaker 2>And the corn industry too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's another dark one.</v>

3605
02:37:45.050 --> 02:37:47.060
<v Speaker 2>Three out of every four products in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>grocery store.</v>

3606
02:37:47.061 --> 02:37:49.820

<v Speaker 2>quarter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I saw the documentary king corn.</v>

3608
02:37:52.550 --> 02:37:54.470
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen that when they test their</v>
<v Speaker 2>DNA?</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3610
02:37:55.701 --> 02:37:57.530

3611
02:37:57.531 --> 02:38:01.970
<v Speaker 2>The carbon in their fucking very virtual</v>
<v Speaker 2>being and it's like predominantly corn.</v>

3612
02:38:03.760 --> 02:38:06.710
<v Speaker 2>These guys are there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're doing this documentary and they</v>

3613
02:38:06.711 --> 02:38:08.650
<v Speaker 2>start growing their own corner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really fast.</v>

3614
02:38:08.660 --> 02:38:09.493
<v Speaker 2>It's corn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>corn,</v>

3615

<v Speaker 2>corner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>

3653
02:39:43.880 --> 02:39:47.690
<v Speaker 2>You just can't be out on the sidewalk.</v>

3654
02:39:47.750 --> 02:39:52.640
<v Speaker 2>state like countrywide legalization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ten years.</v>

3655
02:39:52.940 --> 02:39:54.200

<v Speaker 2>the states that have legalized,</v>

3658
02:39:57.351 --> 02:40:00.340
<v Speaker 2>they're doing fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're doing better than fiber and so</v>

<v Speaker 2>it's like people realize it's not the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just had to get past this propaganda</v>

<v Speaker 2>what do you think about that jeff</v>

<v Speaker 2>One of my favorite ones.</v>

3665
02:40:17.701 --> 02:40:19.980
<v Speaker 2>Good people don't smoke marijuana.</v>

3666
02:40:22.730 --> 02:40:25.830
<v Speaker 2>I'd love to know the list of drugs that</v>
<v Speaker 2>Donald trump has done over the salt.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He doesn't drink.</v>

3673
02:40:31.900 --> 02:40:33.050
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't drink.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Anymore.</v>

3674
02:40:33.620 --> 02:40:36.530
<v Speaker 2>Remember when they were accusing him on</v>
<v Speaker 2>CNN of doing coke?</v>

3675
02:40:36.560 --> 02:40:38.820
<v Speaker 2>It was potentially doing coke lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3680
02:40:52.440 --> 02:40:54.200
<v Speaker 2>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the singer of the campaign,</v>

3681
02:40:54.201 --> 02:40:55.510
<v Speaker 2>wasn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty good.</v>

3682
02:40:55.940 --> 02:40:58.610
<v Speaker 2>Did you enjoy the whole festivities?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you enjoy the,</v>

3683
02:40:59.110 --> 02:41:01.580
<v Speaker 2>of the nonsense of it or were you upset</v>
<v Speaker 2>by it?</v>

3684
02:41:02.050 --> 02:41:03.590
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3685
02:41:03.591 --> 02:41:05.060
<v Speaker 2>I just kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all.</v>

3686
02:41:05.240 --> 02:41:06.920
<v Speaker 2>I did one segment where I took,</v>
<v Speaker 2>honestly,</v>

3687
02:41:06.921 --> 02:41:10.490
<v Speaker 2>it was like three minutes of the two of</v>
<v Speaker 2>them talking to another debate and just</v>

3688
02:41:10.490 --> 02:41:11.630
<v Speaker 2>every half sentence I would stop it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

3689
02:41:11.690 --> 02:41:12.380
<v Speaker 2>that's not true.</v>

3690
02:41:12.380 --> 02:41:13.700
<v Speaker 2>That's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not true.</v>

3691
02:41:13.810 --> 02:41:14.750
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's bullshit.</v>

3692
02:41:14.870 --> 02:41:16.650
<v Speaker 2>Like every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like everything,</v>

3693
02:41:16.790 --> 02:41:20.330
<v Speaker 2>every word that comes out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's somehow manipulation and it was</v>

3694
02:41:20.331 --> 02:41:21.320
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3695
02:41:21.340 --> 02:41:23.300
<v Speaker 2>it's both sides on both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

3696
02:41:23.310 --> 02:41:24.590
<v Speaker 2>and I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

3697
02:41:24.591 --> 02:41:26.510
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried to cover it as little as I</v>

3698
02:41:26.511 --> 02:41:27.650
<v Speaker 2>could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's still covered it a lot,</v>

3699
02:41:27.651 --> 02:41:30.140
<v Speaker 2>but I tried to avoid it as much as I</v>
<v Speaker 2>could because it's just a fucking</v>

3700
02:41:30.410 --> 02:41:33.610
<v Speaker 2>sideshow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My most frustrating thing of the</v>

3701
02:41:33.620 --> 02:41:38.450
<v Speaker 2>campaign wasn't just that because I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>aware that there was a lot of things</v>

3702
02:41:38.451 --> 02:41:42.500
<v Speaker 2>that were being said that weren't true</v>
<v Speaker 2>was that there was very few people doing</v>

3703
02:41:42.501 --> 02:41:45.260
<v Speaker 2>what you just said while you recovering</v>
<v Speaker 2>and on both sides.</v>

3704
02:41:45.500 --> 02:41:47.120
<v Speaker 2>Saying that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not true.</v>

3705
02:41:47.121 --> 02:41:48.230
<v Speaker 2>That's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not true.</v>

3706
02:41:48.280 --> 02:41:50.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you go back and forth from a</v>

3707
02:41:50.331 --> 02:41:53.480
<v Speaker 2>right wing show to a left wing show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to pay attention.</v>

3708
02:41:53.510 --> 02:41:55.190
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to know what the hell is</v>
<v Speaker 2>really going on,</v>

3709
02:41:55.220 --> 02:41:56.540
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Student for realities.</v>

3710
02:41:56.570 --> 02:41:58.310
<v Speaker 2>And no one was doing like what you just</v>
<v Speaker 2>said.</v>

3711
02:41:58.311 --> 02:42:00.020
<v Speaker 2>You didn't go with the whole thing like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

3712
02:42:00.021 --> 02:42:01.580
<v Speaker 2>this is all crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3713
02:42:01.950 --> 02:42:04.580
<v Speaker 2>because people are lying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're wrong.</v>

3714
02:42:04.581 --> 02:42:05.414
<v Speaker 2>They're lying.</v>

3715
02:42:07.230 --> 02:42:08.910
<v Speaker 2>Now I want Lee camp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do we do?</v>

3716
02:42:09.750 --> 02:42:12.120
<v Speaker 2>Do we energize Bernie?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got to get them on hormone</v>

3717
02:42:12.121 --> 02:42:14.370
<v Speaker 2>replacement therapy and keep them alive</v>
<v Speaker 2>longer.</v>

3718
02:42:14.560 --> 02:42:17.170
<v Speaker 2>I think you should go get him on a</v>
<v Speaker 2>training regimen.</v>

3719
02:42:17.180 --> 02:42:18.670
<v Speaker 2>I want to get them doing deadlifts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3720
02:42:18.730 --> 02:42:21.300
<v Speaker 2>Got To get them to fix that posture to</v>
<v Speaker 2>this shit.</v>

3721
02:42:21.360 --> 02:42:22.860
<v Speaker 2>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody wants it.</v>

3722
02:42:23.650 --> 02:42:27.260
<v Speaker 2>I'll just take it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want you to put it under your chin on</v>

3723
02:42:27.440 --> 02:42:29.090
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every day when you woke up one,</v>

3724
02:42:29.110 --> 02:42:31.140
<v Speaker 2>just sit up straight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is very important.</v>

3725
02:42:31.160 --> 02:42:32.890
<v Speaker 2>Bernie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't be doing this.</v>

3726
02:42:32.920 --> 02:42:33.751
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this comes.</v>

3727
02:42:33.751 --> 02:42:36.690
<v Speaker 2>This comes from the 30 years of trying</v>
<v Speaker 2>to change the government.</v>

3728
02:42:37.140 --> 02:42:39.500
<v Speaker 2>That just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just wastes time.</v>

3729
02:42:39.620 --> 02:42:44.080
<v Speaker 2>It just shrinks you into a diamond plus</v>
<v Speaker 2>snow shoveling in Vermont.</v>

3730
02:42:44.280 --> 02:42:46.470
<v Speaker 2>I think what he should do is he should</v>
<v Speaker 2>run in four years,</v>

3731
02:42:46.471 --> 02:42:49.020
<v Speaker 2>but he should say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm only going to serve for four years.</v>

3732
02:42:49.860 --> 02:42:53.220
<v Speaker 2>Nobody wants that could make a</v>
<v Speaker 2>difference in the stamina to go eight,</v>

3733
02:42:53.310 --> 02:42:55.740
<v Speaker 2>and then trump's going to come in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have insurance.</v>

3734
02:42:55.800 --> 02:42:58.290
<v Speaker 2>I've got a winning attitude and he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to win again.</v>

3735
02:42:58.770 --> 02:43:02.160
<v Speaker 2>Trump's like overweight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't need that looks great though.</v>

3736
02:43:02.190 --> 02:43:05.040
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't look whatever cocktail he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>on his fucking carrying them through</v>

3737
02:43:05.041 --> 02:43:06.810
<v Speaker 2>like a champ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you.</v>

3738
02:43:06.880 --> 02:43:09.210
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could say about his appearance all</v>

3739
02:43:09.211 --> 02:43:10.290
<v Speaker 2>you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you.</v>

3740
02:43:10.291 --> 02:43:11.800
<v Speaker 2>You'd be absolutely correct,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

3741
02:43:12.310 --> 02:43:14.980
<v Speaker 4>he never showed any signs of physical</v>
<v Speaker 4>deterioration.</v>

3742
02:43:15.210 --> 02:43:16.590
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think he's okay,</v>

3743
02:43:16.591 --> 02:43:18.660
<v Speaker 7>but he is.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He is relatively overweight.</v>

3744
02:43:18.661 --> 02:43:20.580
<v Speaker 7>He's not a healthy man.</v>

3745
02:43:20.950 --> 02:43:22.210
<v Speaker 4>Definitely not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3746
02:43:22.211 --> 02:43:23.920
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I was his friend,</v>

3747
02:43:24.220 --> 02:43:26.500
<v Speaker 4>I would definitely get them on some sort</v>
<v Speaker 4>of an excellent diet.</v>

3748
02:43:26.860 --> 02:43:28.750
<v Speaker 4>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a way to do this better.</v>

3749
02:43:29.020 --> 02:43:30.850
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you allow even more energy and you're a</v>

3750
02:43:30.851 --> 02:43:35.380
<v Speaker 4>god dynamo as it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was a real concern to the Hillary</v>

3751
02:43:35.380 --> 02:43:36.970
<v Speaker 4>Clinton health concern and when you</v>
<v Speaker 4>would bring it up,</v>

3752
02:43:36.971 --> 02:43:41.560
<v Speaker 4>people would say you're an asshole for</v>
<v Speaker 4>discussing and that you're a sexist or</v>

3753
02:43:41.561 --> 02:43:43.390
<v Speaker 4>you're enabling and some sort of a way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

3754
02:43:43.710 --> 02:43:44.350
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>

3755
02:43:44.350 --> 02:43:46.630
<v Speaker 4>these are legitimate concerns.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She had a stroke.</v>

3756
02:43:47.370 --> 02:43:48.440
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

3757
02:43:48.720 --> 02:43:50.070
<v Speaker 7>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't,</v>

3758
02:43:50.071 --> 02:43:51.240
<v Speaker 7>I don't honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a lot of it,</v>

3759
02:43:51.241 --> 02:43:51.620
<v Speaker 7>I don't know,</v>

3760
02:43:51.620 --> 02:43:52.740
<v Speaker 4>tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Say she had a stroke.</v>

3761
02:43:52.800 --> 02:43:53.760
<v Speaker 4>She had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>excuse me,</v>

3762
02:43:53.820 --> 02:43:55.170
<v Speaker 4>she,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she fainted,</v>

3763
02:43:55.200 --> 02:43:56.700
<v Speaker 4>she blacked out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She had a seizure,</v>

3764
02:43:56.910 --> 02:43:59.490
<v Speaker 4>fell and cracked her head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's been,</v>

3765
02:43:59.550 --> 02:44:04.170
<v Speaker 4>that's been confirmed and then she had</v>
<v Speaker 4>another seizure apparently in 2015 that</v>

3766
02:44:04.290 --> 02:44:04.980
<v Speaker 4>was discussed</v>

3767
02:44:04.980 --> 02:44:08.250
<v Speaker 7>during the week and then what was the</v>
<v Speaker 7>one where where Bill Clinton in an</v>

3768
02:44:08.251 --> 02:44:09.180
<v Speaker 7>interview.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He was like.</v>

3769
02:44:09.181 --> 02:44:09.841
<v Speaker 7>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh yeah,</v>

3770
02:44:09.841 --> 02:44:12.900
<v Speaker 7>she has these spells every once in</v>
<v Speaker 7>awhile and anyway,</v>

3771
02:44:12.901 --> 02:44:14.310
<v Speaker 7>the point is like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know what the,</v>

3772
02:44:14.330 --> 02:44:16.680
<v Speaker 7>what the truth of every last detail that</v>
<v Speaker 7>is,</v>

3773
02:44:16.681 --> 02:44:19.770
<v Speaker 7>but it was like it was like they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They're not talking about that in a</v>

3774
02:44:19.771 --> 02:44:21.690
<v Speaker 7>legitimate way.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They're not talking about the fact that</v>

3775
02:44:21.691 --> 02:44:23.370
<v Speaker 7>Donald Trump won't release his medical</v>
<v Speaker 7>records.</v>

3776
02:44:23.371 --> 02:44:25.450
<v Speaker 7>He had one doctor write a five minute</v>
<v Speaker 7>thing and said,</v>

3777
02:44:25.460 --> 02:44:26.700
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's the healthiest guy that's ever</v>

3778
02:44:26.701 --> 02:44:28.680
<v Speaker 7>lived.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What the fuck is that Dick?</v>

3779
02:44:30.090 --> 02:44:34.200
<v Speaker 4>Not Orange pay regular color.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That'd be weird that you cannot be</v>

3780
02:44:34.201 --> 02:44:36.030
<v Speaker 4>addicted to of color from the face.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He got it.</v>

3781
02:44:36.300 --> 02:44:38.970
<v Speaker 4>If you're going to go on and you got to</v>
<v Speaker 4>go all orange all the way down on his</v>

3782
02:44:38.971 --> 02:44:40.080
<v Speaker 4>toes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his orange,</v>

3783
02:44:40.620 --> 02:44:43.410
<v Speaker 4>except like a little strip down as</v>
<v Speaker 4>butthole,</v>

3784
02:44:43.500 --> 02:44:47.370
<v Speaker 4>like when people like Tan spray tanning</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing and then do porno.</v>

3785
02:44:47.490 --> 02:44:50.520
<v Speaker 4>That'd be amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If he had just a really tiny bikini</v>

3786
02:44:50.521 --> 02:44:52.530
<v Speaker 4>line,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well you know,</v>

3787
02:44:52.531 --> 02:44:54.900
<v Speaker 4>people like if you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you remember what it be like if</v>

3788
02:44:54.901 --> 02:44:57.900
<v Speaker 4>people would sit in a tanning bed like</v>
<v Speaker 4>tanning beds have kind of gotten out of</v>

3789
02:44:57.901 --> 02:44:59.580
<v Speaker 4>favor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but one of the things about tanning</v>

3790
02:44:59.581 --> 02:45:01.560
<v Speaker 4>beds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they would leave weird sort of semi</v>

3791
02:45:01.561 --> 02:45:06.561
<v Speaker 4>white spots on your butt because your</v>
<v Speaker 4>cheeks kind of compress and so like your</v>

3792
02:45:06.680 --> 02:45:10.020
<v Speaker 4>cheeks touch each other when you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>lying flat on that thing,</v>

3793
02:45:10.021 --> 02:45:12.390
<v Speaker 4>so in between your butt cheeks gets</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pale,</v>

3794
02:45:12.780 --> 02:45:16.800
<v Speaker 4>like unless you're making a real</v>
<v Speaker 4>concerted effort to spread your asshole</v>

3795
02:45:16.801 --> 02:45:19.590
<v Speaker 4>out and sort of hover over.</v>

3796
02:45:19.590 --> 02:45:24.210
<v Speaker 4>That opened that Suntan booth for a good</v>
<v Speaker 4>solid 20 minutes or how long it takes</v>

3797
02:45:24.211 --> 02:45:26.670
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure Donald Trump has people spread</v>

3798
02:45:26.671 --> 02:45:28.940
<v Speaker 4>his cheeks for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Probably in the tanner.</v>

3799
02:45:29.190 --> 02:45:31.830
<v Speaker 4>They just smooth it all out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's get my cheeks spreaders.</v>

3800
02:45:31.890 --> 02:45:36.890
<v Speaker 4>Get them in here in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3801
02:45:37.200 --> 02:45:39.150
<v Speaker 4>I don't think he's using.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's,</v>

3802
02:45:39.440 --> 02:45:41.610
<v Speaker 4>it's probably a spray tanning type</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

3803
02:45:41.611 --> 02:45:44.300
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't just drinks out of character</v>
<v Speaker 4>so and were just being assholes.</v>

3804
02:45:44.301 --> 02:45:47.250
<v Speaker 4>There's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe there's some kind of excuse to do</v>

3805
02:45:47.251 --> 02:45:48.380
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Spray Foam.</v>

3806
02:45:49.020 --> 02:45:52.560
<v Speaker 4>I've seen people do that with so much</v>
<v Speaker 4>carrot juice and orange.</v>

3807
02:45:52.600 --> 02:45:53.131
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3808
02:45:53.131 --> 02:45:55.440
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was drinking so much carrot juice</v>

3809
02:45:55.441 --> 02:45:57.840
<v Speaker 4>that his fingers started getting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was talking about it.</v>

3810
02:45:58.320 --> 02:46:00.900
<v Speaker 4>It's apparently super common when people</v>
<v Speaker 4>do that,</v>

3811
02:46:00.901 --> 02:46:02.280
<v Speaker 4>they drink a tremendous amount of</v>
<v Speaker 4>characters.</v>

3812
02:46:02.281 --> 02:46:03.920
<v Speaker 4>It literally will change the color of</v>
<v Speaker 4>your skin.</v>

3813
02:46:03.960 --> 02:46:06.240
<v Speaker 4>We didn't look too weird until he</v>
<v Speaker 4>brought it up and you're like,</v>

3814
02:46:06.241 --> 02:46:08.070
<v Speaker 4>oh wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wasn't like,</v>

3815
02:46:08.071 --> 02:46:08.940
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got you,</v>

3816
02:46:09.440 --> 02:46:10.370
<v Speaker 4>you going orange on us.</v>

3817
02:46:10.470 --> 02:46:11.730
<v Speaker 7>It's cutting corners,</v>
<v Speaker 7>not blue.</v>

3818
02:46:11.770 --> 02:46:12.603
<v Speaker 7>It'll be blue.</v>

3819
02:46:13.080 --> 02:46:13.913
<v Speaker 10>That's a good thing.</v>

3820
02:46:16.990 --> 02:46:19.960
<v Speaker 7>How do you have time to do your show and</v>
<v Speaker 7>do standup?</v>

3821
02:46:20.620 --> 02:46:21.840
<v Speaker 7>Is that difficult to do?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

3822
02:46:21.850 --> 02:46:22.960
<v Speaker 7>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I only,</v>

3823
02:46:23.050 --> 02:46:25.090
<v Speaker 7>I've only been doing stand up,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

3824
02:46:25.180 --> 02:46:27.160
<v Speaker 7>when I go out to cities and I do,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>

3825
02:46:27.161 --> 02:46:30.580
<v Speaker 7>I'll play a theater or something,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I haven't been getting up as much as</v>

3826
02:46:30.581 --> 02:46:33.670
<v Speaker 7>I would like it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So you basically just do your show and</v>

3827
02:46:33.710 --> 02:46:36.610
<v Speaker 7>like does a lot of the subject matter</v>
<v Speaker 7>just bleed out in your standup because</v>

3828
02:46:36.660 --> 02:46:38.700
<v Speaker 7>of working on this stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 7>You must find some pretty observed</v>

3829
02:46:38.701 --> 02:46:42.370
<v Speaker 7>subjects.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Most of my standup,</v>

3830
02:46:42.480 --> 02:46:44.830
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it comes from stuff from the shell</v>

3831
02:46:44.890 --> 02:46:47.830
<v Speaker 7>because it's just like I can't fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I basically have two,</v>

3832
02:46:47.831 --> 02:46:50.560
<v Speaker 7>I have two TV shows,</v>
<v Speaker 7>one of them and luckily as an interview</v>

3833
02:46:50.561 --> 02:46:53.350
<v Speaker 7>show so it doesn't fill up as much in my</v>
<v Speaker 7>writing time,</v>

3834
02:46:53.380 --> 02:46:55.210
<v Speaker 7>but,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I've got the right to a whole other</v>

3835
02:46:55.211 --> 02:46:58.770
<v Speaker 7>show every week and so I just don't have</v>
<v Speaker 7>time to write new standup.</v>

3836
02:46:58.780 --> 02:47:02.320
<v Speaker 7>So the standup usually becomes a stuff</v>
<v Speaker 7>that was in the show.</v>

3837
02:47:02.560 --> 02:47:04.510
<v Speaker 7>Are you planning on doing a special</v>
<v Speaker 7>anything anytime soon?</v>

3838
02:47:05.110 --> 02:47:07.510
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well we just filmed this a redacted</v>

3839
02:47:07.511 --> 02:47:10.320

<v Speaker 7>We called it or whatever and laugh</v>

3840
02:47:10.330 --> 02:47:15.130

<v Speaker 7>of that at the end of December on our</v>

3841
02:47:15.131 --> 02:47:17.680
<v Speaker 7>youtube channel.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So that'll be a bit of a special.</v>

3842
02:47:17.740 --> 02:47:19.450
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
