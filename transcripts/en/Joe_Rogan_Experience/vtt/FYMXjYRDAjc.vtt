<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

74
00:02:35.671 --> 00:02:37.890
<v Speaker 1>Just the Everest experts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

75
00:02:37.891 --> 00:02:39.980

<v Speaker 1>Little bit more raw than it is now.</v>

78
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:45.520
<v Speaker 1>How is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

79
00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.700
<v Speaker 1>what has happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because on the outside,</v>

80
00:02:47.701 --> 00:02:51.360
<v Speaker 1>what I've seen is all the expos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a's that show all the human waste that</v>

81
00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.880
<v Speaker 1>they leave behind and including actual</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>

82
00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.690
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tents and people pay people to kind of</v>

83
00:02:57.691 --> 00:03:00.100
<v Speaker 1>do all the hard work and then you just</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of show</v>

84
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.230
<v Speaker 2>up and still hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

85
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.930
<v Speaker 2>But not as hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to put in,</v>

86
00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to put it in his steps.</v>

87
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.590
<v Speaker 2>We've got to put in the work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's so commercialized that it's</v>

88
00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:14.410
<v Speaker 2>been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been diluted to a certain extent.</v>

89
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.820
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

90
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.770
<v Speaker 2>I am a Sherpa advocate to the core,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

91
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.600
<v Speaker 2>these guys do the work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they put it in every single day</v>

92
00:03:25.601 --> 00:03:27.880
<v Speaker 2>there humping the loads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're cooking the food,</v>

93
00:03:27.881 --> 00:03:31.990
<v Speaker 2>they're setting the lines there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're taking the biggest risk and then</v>

94
00:03:31.991 --> 00:03:33.490
<v Speaker 2>allowing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

95
00:03:33.491 --> 00:03:37.720
<v Speaker 2>other folks to move through a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 2>more effectively and faster and not have</v>

96
00:03:37.721 --> 00:03:41.260
<v Speaker 2>to expend as much energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so over the we Kinda,</v>

97
00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.260
<v Speaker 2>we kinda got in there and no one towards</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

98
00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.280
<v Speaker 2>I think on the head ahead of the curve</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a little bit as to when it started</v>

99
00:03:48.281 --> 00:03:51.850
<v Speaker 2>to sort of change the face of Everest</v>
<v Speaker 2>changed a little bit.</v>

100
00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.780
<v Speaker 2>So how did they make it easier?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what do they do that made it more</v>

101
00:03:55.781 --> 00:03:56.920
<v Speaker 2>commercial?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

102
00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.690
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no money number one gets in there and,</v>

103
00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.570
<v Speaker 2>and pays a lot more sherpas to do a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>more work.</v>

104
00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.690
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the lines are fixed.</v>

105
00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.010
<v Speaker 2>The weather forecasting models are more</v>
<v Speaker 2>effective and more efficient and say the</v>

106
00:04:12.011 --> 00:04:14.320
<v Speaker 2>lines are fixed and the lines are fixed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning the ropes,</v>

107
00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:15.880
<v Speaker 2>the ropes on the mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

108
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:17.730
<v Speaker 2>there's fixed Dan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you clip in.</v>

109
00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:19.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you clip into a rope so when you go up,</v>

110
00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:20.680
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the ropes are there.</v>

111
00:04:20.681 --> 00:04:22.810
<v Speaker 2>Before you get there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all you have to do is just kind of like</v>

112
00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.300
<v Speaker 2>huff it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not like before.</v>

113
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:26.500
<v Speaker 2>So you kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

114
00:04:26.501 --> 00:04:28.480
<v Speaker 2>that's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's almost like you're on like a</v>

115
00:04:28.481 --> 00:04:30.590
<v Speaker 2>theme park,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like an Everest.</v>

116
00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.410
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're still an everest and you still</v>

117
00:04:32.411 --> 00:04:33.760
<v Speaker 2>could get fucked up by an avalanche.</v>

118
00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:34.870
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no question.</v>

119
00:04:34.871 --> 00:04:37.450
<v Speaker 2>It's very dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no way to mitigate all of that.</v>

120
00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:38.770
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's uh,</v>

121
00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.110
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has been,</v>

122
00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:44.980
<v Speaker 2>it has been eased up a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The edges have been taken off just a</v>

123
00:04:44.981 --> 00:04:47.350
<v Speaker 2>slight bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it also adds that they're dangerous</v>

124
00:04:47.351 --> 00:04:49.000
<v Speaker 2>because one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I was looking at it,</v>

125
00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.850
<v Speaker 2>it's sometimes more dangerous now</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's lines,</v>

126
00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.260
<v Speaker 2>there's sometimes 300 people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>600 people in a line and you're waiting</v>

127
00:04:56.261 --> 00:04:59.590
<v Speaker 2>from some asshole who didn't train and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're watching him trying to climb up</v>

128
00:04:59.591 --> 00:05:01.950
<v Speaker 2>this little 20 foot cliff and they don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>know how to work at Gmr.</v>

129
00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.380
<v Speaker 2>They can't climb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's a Jew Mar to hand to hand things</v>

130
00:05:05.381 --> 00:05:08.170
<v Speaker 2>in the sending device.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a one way of sending device to</v>

131
00:05:08.171 --> 00:05:11.590
<v Speaker 2>go up a rope so you can slide it up and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it catches on the way down pull.</v>

132
00:05:11.591 --> 00:05:12.910
<v Speaker 2>But there people go up there.</v>

133
00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:15.010
<v Speaker 2>And when we were up there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had people,</v>

134
00:05:15.011 --> 00:05:18.040
<v Speaker 2>they've literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>without talking shit about tracking</v>

135
00:05:18.041 --> 00:05:19.330
<v Speaker 2>companies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are some companies like,</v>

136
00:05:19.331 --> 00:05:20.440
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to show you how to put your</v>

137
00:05:20.441 --> 00:05:21.550
<v Speaker 2>crampons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

138
00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:24.360
<v Speaker 2>as you're going in the icefall if she</v>
<v Speaker 2>christ.</v>

139
00:05:24.361 --> 00:05:24.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've,</v>

140
00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:26.380
<v Speaker 2>they've learned like we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>learn,</v>

141
00:05:26.381 --> 00:05:28.270
<v Speaker 2>we're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've never had crampons before.</v>

142
00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:30.820
<v Speaker 2>We had to Jeff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not me.</v>

143
00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.270
<v Speaker 2>Jeff had to rescue risk his life and</v>
<v Speaker 2>helicopters going to high,</v>

144
00:05:34.271 --> 00:05:37.300
<v Speaker 2>high altitude to pick up people who</v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't no business on the mountain.</v>

145
00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:41.200
<v Speaker 2>So they didn't manage to get their body</v>
<v Speaker 2>acclimated.</v>

146
00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:45.010
<v Speaker 2>Is that what the issue is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't put in the the</v>

147
00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:49.810
<v Speaker 2>apprenticeship cause you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and nowadays the commercial component</v>

148
00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:55.020
<v Speaker 2>allows folks that have enough money to</v>
<v Speaker 2>pay and then show up and get guided</v>

149
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.070
<v Speaker 2>basically to the top.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So back in the day it was,</v>

150
00:06:01.071 --> 00:06:03.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you didn't have your teeth cut,</v>

151
00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:04.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

152
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.970
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

153
00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:06.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was on you.</v>

154
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:09.590
<v Speaker 2>And nowadays you can just show up and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

155
00:06:09.591 --> 00:06:13.070
<v Speaker 2>generally someone will be taken care of</v>
<v Speaker 2>you whether it's a god or whether it's a</v>

156
00:06:13.071 --> 00:06:14.510
<v Speaker 2>Sherpa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

157
00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:15.920
<v Speaker 2>and so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

158
00:06:15.921 --> 00:06:17.210
<v Speaker 2>it's changed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

159
00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.200
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

160
00:06:18.201 --> 00:06:20.630
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to take anything from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>folks who still go out there.</v>

161
00:06:20.631 --> 00:06:22.640
<v Speaker 2>It's a dream for so many people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

162
00:06:22.641 --> 00:06:26.780
<v Speaker 2>and it's still an aspiration and a in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a life goal for,</v>

163
00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of folks and it's still very</v>

164
00:06:29.541 --> 00:06:31.130
<v Speaker 2>difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so for instance,</v>

165
00:06:31.131 --> 00:06:33.980
<v Speaker 2>last year we just saw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we saw a really nice cross</v>

166
00:06:33.981 --> 00:06:36.680
<v Speaker 2>section of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of skilled,</v>

167
00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:40.010
<v Speaker 2>experienced climbers trying it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then we saw a shit show,</v>

168
00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:42.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we saw a lot of folks who should have</v>

169
00:06:42.471 --> 00:06:44.540
<v Speaker 2>been on other peaks first and then they</v>
<v Speaker 2>weren't,</v>

170
00:06:44.541 --> 00:06:46.150
<v Speaker 2>they skipped to the top,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

171
00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:48.350
<v Speaker 2>you know anything in life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

172
00:06:48.351 --> 00:06:51.950
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you bypass the work and you get smoked.</v>

173
00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:53.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we did a,</v>

174
00:06:53.751 --> 00:06:54.950
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our rescue team,</v>

175
00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.830
<v Speaker 2>ars rescue team,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our five Sherpas did the highest</v>

176
00:06:57.831 --> 00:07:01.790
<v Speaker 2>altitude rescue in history at 28,500 off</v>
<v Speaker 2>the balcony and a girl,</v>

177
00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:02.960
<v Speaker 2>husband.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And wife.</v>

178
00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:04.820
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if they did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did she summit?</v>

179
00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:06.580
<v Speaker 2>I don't think she summited though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

180
00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:11.000
<v Speaker 2>as she was coming down the summit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the 29 35,</v>

181
00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:13.910
<v Speaker 2>she's at 28,</v>
<v Speaker 2>500 and she decided to sit down.</v>

182
00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:15.800
<v Speaker 2>Husband left her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's tapped out.</v>

183
00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:17.420
<v Speaker 2>How's the left foot?</v>
<v Speaker 2>People quit.</v>

184
00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:19.590
<v Speaker 2>People quit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she sat down,</v>

185
00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:21.550
<v Speaker 2>but she sat down and he left her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

186
00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.690
<v Speaker 2>Oh wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's more to that story.</v>

187
00:07:23.691 --> 00:07:27.280
<v Speaker 2>So he left her and then we go rescue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or should he say,</v>

188
00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:29.090
<v Speaker 2>sit right here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll come back in a couple of days.</v>

189
00:07:29.091 --> 00:07:30.710
<v Speaker 2>This is up for questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like there,</v>

190
00:07:30.711 --> 00:07:32.870
<v Speaker 2>there's two ways to look at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about this last night</v>

191
00:07:32.871 --> 00:07:36.950
<v Speaker 2>was she may have just been a tap out</v>
<v Speaker 2>bitch and just said,</v>

192
00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:37.640
<v Speaker 2>I quit.</v>

193
00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.560
<v Speaker 2>And he tried to employ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please come out,</v>

194
00:07:39.561 --> 00:07:40.191
<v Speaker 2>come out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on.</v>

195
00:07:40.191 --> 00:07:42.020
<v Speaker 2>And finally just left her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one scenario.</v>

196
00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:44.600
<v Speaker 2>The other scenario is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

197
00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:46.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just was like,</v>

198
00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:47.870
<v Speaker 2>peace out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good luck.</v>

199
00:07:47.871 --> 00:07:49.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the problem.</v>

200
00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:51.980
<v Speaker 2>I do it this way and I understand about</v>
<v Speaker 2>diving.</v>

201
00:07:51.981 --> 00:07:55.250
<v Speaker 2>So let's say you and I are diving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're 300 feet below the blow the water</v>

202
00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:58.760
<v Speaker 2>right and my air goes out and I know we</v>
<v Speaker 2>can buddy breathe,</v>

203
00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:01.430
<v Speaker 2>but let's pretend there's nobody</v>
<v Speaker 2>breathing and you're going to stick</v>

204
00:08:01.431 --> 00:08:04.370
<v Speaker 2>around and watch me die and you're gonna</v>
<v Speaker 2>end up dying or I'm going to grab a hold</v>

205
00:08:04.371 --> 00:08:05.890
<v Speaker 2>of you and grab your regulator and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

206
00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:07.130
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're both going to die.</v>

207
00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:10.580
<v Speaker 2>You can't help anybody at that level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't,</v>

208
00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:11.930
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're tired.</v>

209
00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.590
<v Speaker 2>Your body is eating itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're basically dying in the death</v>

210
00:08:15.591 --> 00:08:17.960
<v Speaker 2>zone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He could explain that basically.</v>

211
00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:20.180
<v Speaker 2>And if your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if your wife says,</v>

212
00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:22.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm sitting down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to get up in five minutes,</v>

213
00:08:22.911 --> 00:08:26.570
<v Speaker 2>you go ahead and she's got a Sherpa with</v>
<v Speaker 2>her and then you go,</v>

214
00:08:26.571 --> 00:08:28.460
<v Speaker 2>I go ahead and you get back to camp</v>
<v Speaker 2>four,</v>

215
00:08:28.461 --> 00:08:31.640
<v Speaker 2>which is exactly what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get down to camp four and look around</v>

216
00:08:31.641 --> 00:08:32.474
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why it's not there.</v>

217
00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:35.450
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they call us and they wake jeff</v>

218
00:08:35.451 --> 00:08:37.070
<v Speaker 2>and I up and were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to what?</v>

219
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:40.880
<v Speaker 2>So I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was with her right at base camp when</v>

220
00:08:40.881 --> 00:08:42.980
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we delivered her to her husband and</v>

221
00:08:42.981 --> 00:08:45.800
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to gauge like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is he going to be one of these guys?</v>

222
00:08:45.801 --> 00:08:47.000
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

223
00:08:47.001 --> 00:08:49.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm so glad you're alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or Holy Shit,</v>

224
00:08:49.881 --> 00:08:50.714
<v Speaker 2>she's alive.</v>

225
00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:53.643
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>

226
00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:57.810
<v Speaker 2>And I think it was the former,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he was really ecstatic.</v>

227
00:08:57.811 --> 00:08:58.710
<v Speaker 2>He was crying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember?</v>

228
00:08:58.711 --> 00:09:00.660
<v Speaker 2>He was really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was really upset.</v>

229
00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:04.560
<v Speaker 2>But then hold on all they'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

230
00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:05.091
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

231
00:09:05.091 --> 00:09:06.910
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It goes back because actually the first</v>

232
00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:10.200
<v Speaker 2>first kick in the balls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so without taking the whole thing to</v>

233
00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:12.260
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what had to happen is,</v>

234
00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:17.370
<v Speaker 2>as Jeff and I and our base camp manager,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anthony had to take for Sherpas from</v>

235
00:09:17.371 --> 00:09:21.510
<v Speaker 2>camp to or can't for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>took two Sherpas and then two more in</v>

236
00:09:21.511 --> 00:09:23.760
<v Speaker 2>the middle of the night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So six o'clock,</v>

237
00:09:23.761 --> 00:09:25.980
<v Speaker 2>seven o'clock at night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most dangerous type winds are</v>

238
00:09:25.981 --> 00:09:29.070
<v Speaker 2>blowing 30 40 miles an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's 20 degrees below zero.</v>

239
00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.010
<v Speaker 2>Nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody's ever done.</v>

240
00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:33.870
<v Speaker 2>You don't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we sent them up there and we said,</v>

241
00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:35.500
<v Speaker 2>can you go get her?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>

242
00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:38.040
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you've got to find this person on</v>

243
00:09:38.041 --> 00:09:38.640
<v Speaker 2>the line.</v>

244
00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:41.340
<v Speaker 2>So they walked and they kept walking and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they kept walking.</v>

245
00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:43.050
<v Speaker 2>And we have video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember meagan was video.</v>

246
00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:44.580
<v Speaker 2>How long does it take to get up the</v>
<v Speaker 2>line?</v>

247
00:09:44.581 --> 00:09:48.180
<v Speaker 2>Like how normal normal human being you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the three of us,</v>

248
00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:53.040
<v Speaker 2>how long would it take for three of us</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get from the south call to where she</v>

249
00:09:53.041 --> 00:09:57.090
<v Speaker 2>was pro three or four hours if you're in</v>
<v Speaker 2>shape.</v>

250
00:09:57.091 --> 00:09:59.670
<v Speaker 2>So take me out of that because I'm not a</v>
<v Speaker 2>runner.</v>

251
00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:01.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm not doing any high altitude</v>

252
00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:04.830
<v Speaker 2>hiking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gimme five hours.</v>

253
00:10:04.831 --> 00:10:05.371
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

254
00:10:05.371 --> 00:10:08.280
<v Speaker 2>so it's like very dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Extremely dangerous.</v>

255
00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:09.450
<v Speaker 2>Especially at night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At the worst.</v>

256
00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:10.400
<v Speaker 2>Getting it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

257
00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:13.020
<v Speaker 2>At the worst time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not even no one,</v>

258
00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:17.580
<v Speaker 2>no one knows where she is now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the terrain dictates that she has to</v>

259
00:10:17.581 --> 00:10:19.530
<v Speaker 2>be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless she's fallen off the side,</v>

260
00:10:19.531 --> 00:10:22.470
<v Speaker 2>she's on a spine basically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

261
00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:24.270
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you go up the ridge,</v>

262
00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:28.170
<v Speaker 2>you're either going to find her if she's</v>
<v Speaker 2>alive or she's tossed off the side.</v>

263
00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:30.750
<v Speaker 2>So she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and also she's dealing with super low</v>

264
00:10:30.751 --> 00:10:32.340
<v Speaker 2>air,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no air squeezing,</v>

265
00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:35.700
<v Speaker 2>extremely cold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nowhere bringing third of what you got</v>

266
00:10:35.701 --> 00:10:36.660
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they bring tanks.</v>

267
00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But her era was gone.</v>

268
00:10:38.071 --> 00:10:39.080
<v Speaker 2>So you're drinking your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

269
00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:41.340
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she brought no air with her or she</v>

270
00:10:41.341 --> 00:10:42.320
<v Speaker 2>brought with her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's done.</v>

271
00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:44.950
<v Speaker 2>She was abandoned basically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they left her.</v>

272
00:10:44.951 --> 00:10:47.850
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>generally you would have somebody with</v>

273
00:10:47.851 --> 00:10:49.680
<v Speaker 2>an extra tank to be able to help her</v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

274
00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:52.800
<v Speaker 2>But I get the sense that she just said</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm done.</v>

275
00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.590
<v Speaker 2>And she sat down and everybody tried to</v>
<v Speaker 2>kiss me and then no one,</v>

276
00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:58.200
<v Speaker 2>no one could get her to get and want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>walk back with her.</v>

277
00:10:58.910 --> 00:10:59.743
<v Speaker 2>Can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't,</v>

278
00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:03.420
<v Speaker 2>you can't carry [inaudible] 29,000 feet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>28,000 feet.</v>

279
00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:05.270
<v Speaker 2>So keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she,</v>

280
00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:09.000
<v Speaker 2>the oxygen up there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>33% less than what's here at sea level.</v>

281
00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:13.220
<v Speaker 2>33% 33% so at 67% less authored.</v>

282
00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:14.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

283
00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.070
<v Speaker 2>Normal auction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was no auction,</v>

284
00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.970
<v Speaker 2>so she sat down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the boys,</v>

285
00:11:17.971 --> 00:11:20.760
<v Speaker 2>we have gopros on him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had special cameras and pockets and</v>

286
00:11:20.761 --> 00:11:23.700
<v Speaker 2>all kinds of weird shit to film on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>mountain and the boys are walking.</v>

287
00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:26.970
<v Speaker 2>I have footage of a Mingma Mingma's</v>
<v Speaker 2>walking up there and he's going,</v>

288
00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:28.100
<v Speaker 2>I swear to God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>

289
00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:32.730
<v Speaker 2>I'll say this for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He speaks decent English the whole time</v>

290
00:11:32.731 --> 00:11:33.750
<v Speaker 2>and I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll send you the clip.</v>

291
00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:35.130
<v Speaker 2>It's the funniest clip you ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

292
00:11:35.131 --> 00:11:37.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm like God damn mother fucking fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking mother.</v>

293
00:11:37.981 --> 00:11:42.630
<v Speaker 2>And He's discussing every step of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way he's fucked up scenario and you</v>

294
00:11:42.631 --> 00:11:43.800
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's middle of the night and he's</v>

295
00:11:43.801 --> 00:11:45.120
<v Speaker 2>looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

296
00:11:45.121 --> 00:11:48.150
<v Speaker 2>potentially dead person in the death</v>
<v Speaker 2>zone.</v>

297
00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:48.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the desks.</v>

298
00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:52.230
<v Speaker 2>A cool situation to tie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is it the death zone?</v>

299
00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.550
<v Speaker 2>Because of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of the lack of oxygen,</v>

300
00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:57.220
<v Speaker 2>your body's body starts to conspire</v>
<v Speaker 2>against you.</v>

301
00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:58.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

302
00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:00.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't assimilate any nutrition.</v>

303
00:12:00.551 --> 00:12:01.384
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

304
00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:05.830
<v Speaker 2>the fluid in your body starts to go to</v>
<v Speaker 2>places it's not supposed to go.</v>

305
00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:10.330
<v Speaker 2>So it goes up in your brain and you get</v>
<v Speaker 2>cerebral edema and you make that</v>

306
00:12:10.331 --> 00:12:12.640
<v Speaker 2>decisions and you get a headache and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>lose your vision.</v>

307
00:12:12.641 --> 00:12:15.400
<v Speaker 2>And then you get pulmonary edema.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your lungs fill up with fluid and you</v>

308
00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:17.460
<v Speaker 2>drown in your own fluid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

309
00:12:17.461 --> 00:12:18.294
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's uh,</v>

310
00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:21.130
<v Speaker 2>this is like stepping out of the state</v>
<v Speaker 2>capitol and Mars and I wonder what this</v>

311
00:12:21.131 --> 00:12:23.200
<v Speaker 2>is going to do to my body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you step out and shit starts</v>

312
00:12:23.201 --> 00:12:23.921
<v Speaker 2>popping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

313
00:12:23.921 --> 00:12:25.370
<v Speaker 2>it's strange up there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

314
00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:28.360
<v Speaker 2>They've done MRI studies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually that's where it is right there.</v>

315
00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:31.510
<v Speaker 2>This was the line that Jamie pulled up</v>
<v Speaker 2>over to the red zone.</v>

316
00:12:31.511 --> 00:12:34.540
<v Speaker 2>Lack of oxygen above 8,000 meters can be</v>
<v Speaker 2>fatal to climbers.</v>

317
00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:37.120
<v Speaker 2>So see that labs and feet is fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>high.</v>

318
00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:39.250
<v Speaker 2>8,000 meters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is,</v>

319
00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:42.220
<v Speaker 2>that's the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See that last dot before the summit?</v>

320
00:12:42.221 --> 00:12:45.520
<v Speaker 2>That's 26,000 feet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is right there.</v>

321
00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:46.631
<v Speaker 2>Exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie.</v>

322
00:12:46.631 --> 00:12:48.850
<v Speaker 2>That does that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where she goes above.</v>

323
00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:51.580
<v Speaker 2>That's what the campaign up and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>the balcony.</v>

324
00:12:51.581 --> 00:12:54.190
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she was almost there 500 feet.</v>

325
00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:56.620
<v Speaker 2>She was 500 feet from the top.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She may have,</v>

326
00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:57.880
<v Speaker 2>who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if she made it.</v>

327
00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:01.240
<v Speaker 2>She was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was a 28,500 we have a gps</v>

328
00:13:01.241 --> 00:13:03.850
<v Speaker 2>coordinates on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was at 28,005 to 500 feet from the</v>

329
00:13:03.851 --> 00:13:05.770
<v Speaker 2>top.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she could almost say she summited</v>

330
00:13:05.771 --> 00:13:07.240
<v Speaker 2>Everest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was like,</v>

331
00:13:07.241 --> 00:13:10.300
<v Speaker 2>she could see like Everest was like</v>
<v Speaker 2>where your car's parked.</v>

332
00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:11.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Except things.</v>

333
00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:14.970
<v Speaker 2>A lot of crazy ass terrain in between</v>
<v Speaker 2>where she was and across.</v>

334
00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:17.740
<v Speaker 2>That's where the Hillary step is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's where the ridge goes.</v>

335
00:13:17.741 --> 00:13:21.430
<v Speaker 2>It's no louder than your laptop and</v>
<v Speaker 2>sections and it's a 10,000 foot drop</v>

336
00:13:21.431 --> 00:13:22.240
<v Speaker 2>into Tibet.</v>

337
00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:25.300
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a 6,000 foot dropping it in Nepal to</v>

338
00:13:25.301 --> 00:13:27.190
<v Speaker 2>the left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Either way it would hurt pretty fucking.</v>

339
00:13:27.191 --> 00:13:30.280
<v Speaker 2>This is wine is a laptop in sections.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty,</v>

340
00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:31.690
<v Speaker 2>pretty narrow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

341
00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:35.020
<v Speaker 2>but then it wa it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it opens up and it,</v>

342
00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:38.590
<v Speaker 2>and it shrinks down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I mean it's no place to screw the</v>

343
00:13:38.591 --> 00:13:41.410
<v Speaker 2>pooch and she did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

344
00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:43.040
<v Speaker 2>oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is right here.</v>

345
00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:45.760
<v Speaker 2>Unless the Hillary step right there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which by the way,</v>

346
00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:49.310
<v Speaker 2>it was really interesting two years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember the earthquake two years ago</v>

347
00:13:49.311 --> 00:13:52.930
<v Speaker 2>in the fall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it knocked that whole boulder off</v>

348
00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:54.310
<v Speaker 2>that boulder that people are standing</v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

349
00:13:54.311 --> 00:13:55.240
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Hillary Sta.</v>

350
00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:56.500
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if you're on that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

351
00:13:56.501 --> 00:14:00.580
<v Speaker 2>I made it</v>
<v Speaker 2>go on for the ride.</v>

352
00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:02.590
<v Speaker 2>That's at the peak of Everest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their Nav.</v>

353
00:14:02.591 --> 00:14:05.400
<v Speaker 2>You Bro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll fucking hop off and grab a hold of,</v>

354
00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:09.460
<v Speaker 2>maybe you bro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>

355
00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:10.690
<v Speaker 2>look at that.</v>

356
00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:12.580
<v Speaker 2>Look at that clown show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

357
00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:15.700
<v Speaker 2>So many people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if someone falls onto you,</v>

358
00:14:15.701 --> 00:14:17.260
<v Speaker 2>you got a real problem too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

359
00:14:17.261 --> 00:14:20.830
<v Speaker 2>So the year we were up there in 2000 the</v>
<v Speaker 2>year before the fall,</v>

360
00:14:20.831 --> 00:14:23.260
<v Speaker 2>before there was a British guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember his name,</v>

361
00:14:23.261 --> 00:14:27.250
<v Speaker 2>but he got caught up in the ropes</v>
<v Speaker 2>descending from the summit down the</v>

362
00:14:27.251 --> 00:14:30.760
<v Speaker 2>hillary step and got caught and there</v>
<v Speaker 2>was nobody there with him.</v>

363
00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:36.300
<v Speaker 2>And he got caught caught and he got</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuck in perpetuity.</v>

364
00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:43.470
<v Speaker 2>So we thought that for sure the first</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that were going up and oh one</v>

365
00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:48.550
<v Speaker 2>that were like a few weeks before us had</v>
<v Speaker 2>to cut him free cause we were,</v>

366
00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:49.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're speculating.</v>

367
00:14:49.451 --> 00:14:52.940
<v Speaker 2>Like if we're the first group that gets</v>
<v Speaker 2>up there going to have to scoot around,</v>

368
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:53.900
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this fella,</v>

369
00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:56.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he's just stuck on this line.</v>

370
00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:58.210
<v Speaker 2>But he wasn't there when we got up</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

371
00:14:58.280 --> 00:14:59.470
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't somebody who already come</v>
<v Speaker 2>from.</v>

372
00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:00.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now what did they do?</v>

373
00:15:00.621 --> 00:15:01.760
<v Speaker 2>Push them off the side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

374
00:15:01.761 --> 00:15:05.670
<v Speaker 2>here's something for Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's 248 bodies on Everest right</v>

375
00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:06.680
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Still there.</v>

376
00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:08.390
<v Speaker 2>And these climbers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't go up.</v>

377
00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:12.770
<v Speaker 2>I was at base camp [inaudible] the</v>
<v Speaker 2>climbers use them as mark markers.</v>

378
00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:15.530
<v Speaker 2>You kind of go up here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's the original climber.</v>

379
00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:17.330
<v Speaker 2>The guy for the first kind of make it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

380
00:15:17.331 --> 00:15:18.170
<v Speaker 2>they found one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

381
00:15:18.171 --> 00:15:21.200
<v Speaker 2>but he's on the south summit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's on the other side on the north side</v>

382
00:15:21.201 --> 00:15:26.201
<v Speaker 2>and Ted Malerie malerie they found</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mallory's body body back.</v>

383
00:15:26.451 --> 00:15:28.400
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is back until they're frozen.</v>

384
00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:30.440
<v Speaker 2>They're weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

385
00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:34.400
<v Speaker 2>Ivory skin still flesh like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

386
00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:37.640
<v Speaker 2>Still flush their fleets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cryogenically frozen.</v>

387
00:15:37.641 --> 00:15:39.230
<v Speaker 2>The crows pick at them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they eat them.</v>

388
00:15:39.231 --> 00:15:40.790
<v Speaker 2>There's crows at that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at that altitude.</v>

389
00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:43.100
<v Speaker 2>They pick at him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy,</v>

390
00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:44.720
<v Speaker 2>mallory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>

391
00:15:44.721 --> 00:15:46.040
<v Speaker 2>look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's so weird.</v>

392
00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:47.960
<v Speaker 2>But that dude's a bad dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

393
00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:51.320
<v Speaker 2>That is a very bad man right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because they went out with some hobnail</v>

394
00:15:51.321 --> 00:15:55.220
<v Speaker 2>boots and some marginal equipment and</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody was telling him that they were</v>

395
00:15:55.221 --> 00:15:57.740
<v Speaker 2>going to be dead for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they said we're going to charge</v>

396
00:15:57.741 --> 00:15:58.940
<v Speaker 2>ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they did.</v>

397
00:15:58.941 --> 00:16:01.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean this was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was back way back,</v>

398
00:16:01.581 --> 00:16:02.810
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was in the 20s.</v>

399
00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:03.650
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

400
00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:07.490
<v Speaker 2>and there's the controversy that he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that boot the controversy that they</v>

401
00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:09.050
<v Speaker 2>summited first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they can't prove it.</v>

402
00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:12.170
<v Speaker 2>So that's a big controversy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They thought Irvine and Mallory summited</v>

403
00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:15.650
<v Speaker 2>and then they fell on their way down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So crows pick at him.</v>

404
00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:17.120
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what are the,</v>

405
00:16:17.121 --> 00:16:19.550
<v Speaker 2>obviously he's still there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

406
00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:20.181
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

407
00:16:20.181 --> 00:16:22.400
<v Speaker 2>I don't think get at him as much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's,</v>

408
00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:23.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's things,</v>

409
00:16:23.451 --> 00:16:25.700
<v Speaker 2>there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of stuff there,</v>

410
00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:28.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ain't get a lot of,</v>

411
00:16:28.461 --> 00:16:30.650
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot happening there that's</v>

412
00:16:30.651 --> 00:16:31.490
<v Speaker 2>sitting on the mountain.</v>

413
00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:34.880
<v Speaker 2>You have to walk past that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't see that guy.</v>

414
00:16:34.881 --> 00:16:36.710
<v Speaker 2>But you've never seen that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't see that.</v>

415
00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:39.170
<v Speaker 2>How many of the 200 plus bodies have you</v>
<v Speaker 2>seen?</v>

416
00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:39.930
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

417
00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:43.340
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the conditions changed so dramatically</v>

418
00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:45.790
<v Speaker 2>over the each season depending on snow</v>
<v Speaker 2>fall.</v>

419
00:16:45.791 --> 00:16:49.220
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus or some creepy things up there,</v>

420
00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:51.380
<v Speaker 2>zoom out on that dude's face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's,</v>

421
00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:54.090
<v Speaker 2>it looks happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I made it.</v>

422
00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:57.440
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know that nice jacket that's</v>

423
00:16:57.441 --> 00:16:59.300
<v Speaker 2>pretty fresh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a nice looking down seat.</v>

424
00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:01.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's what I'm saying.</v>

425
00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:03.230
<v Speaker 2>Like how many people die a year?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

426
00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:04.890
<v Speaker 2>I think the average is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

427
00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:09.110
<v Speaker 2>nowadays is usually I think somewhere</v>
<v Speaker 2>under 10 but you know,</v>

428
00:17:09.111 --> 00:17:12.650
<v Speaker 2>between six and 10 every season.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how many people attempt it?</v>

429
00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:15.120
<v Speaker 2>I didn't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

430
00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:16.760
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the grade is,</v>

431
00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:19.580
<v Speaker 2>is increasing every year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this year was the most,</v>

432
00:17:19.581 --> 00:17:22.400
<v Speaker 2>it's summited,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most attempted in most summited was</v>

433
00:17:22.401 --> 00:17:22.880
<v Speaker 2>this year.</v>

434
00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:26.180
<v Speaker 2>And I think close to 300 people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the diseases pull that picture</v>

435
00:17:26.181 --> 00:17:28.400
<v Speaker 2>up again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that image of death star Sherpas and</v>

436
00:17:28.401 --> 00:17:30.680
<v Speaker 2>regular folks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of the Sherpas died too,</v>

437
00:17:30.681 --> 00:17:31.161
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

438
00:17:31.161 --> 00:17:33.620
<v Speaker 2>Well I mean there they go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're higher in concentration.</v>

439
00:17:33.621 --> 00:17:35.940
<v Speaker 2>They do the majority of the work as</v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

440
00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:37.360
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's one of the reasons why we</v>

441
00:17:37.361 --> 00:17:38.900
<v Speaker 2>went out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We saved more sherpas.</v>

442
00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:39.631
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we,</v>

443
00:17:39.631 --> 00:17:41.430
<v Speaker 2>we pull a lot of Sherpas off cause we</v>
<v Speaker 2>need more,</v>

444
00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:44.400
<v Speaker 2>more often than not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't have helicopters and they'd</v>

445
00:17:44.401 --> 00:17:47.540
<v Speaker 2>all have helicopter insurance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we would go and I would pay for</v>

446
00:17:47.541 --> 00:17:48.374
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would go,</v>

447
00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:50.640
<v Speaker 2>there's a Sherpa who's really sick and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's going to die.</v>

448
00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:52.470
<v Speaker 2>And then jeff and I would just decide to</v>
<v Speaker 2>pull them off.</v>

449
00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:55.800
<v Speaker 2>Thing they don't have is they don't have</v>
<v Speaker 2>life insurance.</v>

450
00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:57.540
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can imagine,</v>

451
00:17:57.541 --> 00:18:00.990
<v Speaker 2>so a lot of these families,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the Nepali in the high altitude</v>

452
00:18:00.991 --> 00:18:02.040
<v Speaker 2>workers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>families,</v>

453
00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:05.580
<v Speaker 2>they lose their only source of income</v>
<v Speaker 2>when these guys get get killed.</v>

454
00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:08.190
<v Speaker 2>So actually a friend of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Melissa,</v>

455
00:18:08.191 --> 00:18:10.170
<v Speaker 2>or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was the first American woman to</v>

456
00:18:10.171 --> 00:18:14.040
<v Speaker 2>summit Everest without oxygen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just uh,</v>

457
00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:16.230
<v Speaker 2>last year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

458
00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:19.110
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she started a fund called the junior per</v>

459
00:18:19.111 --> 00:18:24.111
<v Speaker 2>fund and it actually compensates the</v>
<v Speaker 2>families when their loved ones or killed</v>

460
00:18:25.051 --> 00:18:26.490
<v Speaker 2>on the mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's nice and it's good.</v>

461
00:18:26.491 --> 00:18:28.210
<v Speaker 2>It keeps them straight because they</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have a choice.</v>

462
00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:30.430
<v Speaker 2>This is [inaudible] to you live on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lake Gail,</v>

463

<v Speaker 2>oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So mean.</v>

468
00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:42.930

<v Speaker 2>They're walking up there and they need</v>

469
00:18:42.931 --> 00:18:43.710
<v Speaker 2>some help.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they,</v>

470
00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:45.600

<v Speaker 2>and I have it all on video and he's gone</v>

471
00:18:45.601 --> 00:18:47.180
<v Speaker 2>fuck a motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He passed.</v>

472
00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:50.130
<v Speaker 2>So funniest thing in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The comedy show.</v>

473
00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:52.680
<v Speaker 2>So then they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they hear music.</v>

474
00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:53.670
<v Speaker 2>Not Kidding.</v>

475
00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:57.180
<v Speaker 2>They hear music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she has a phone on her.</v>

476
00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:02.520
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how the batteries lasting</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she's sitting at the balcony but on</v>

477
00:19:02.521 --> 00:19:06.630
<v Speaker 2>the ice and just barely breathing and</v>
<v Speaker 2>listening to music.</v>

478
00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:09.030
<v Speaker 2>And then so they go to her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brianna or some shit?</v>

479
00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:10.560
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say with some kind of Indian</v>

480
00:19:10.561 --> 00:19:15.270
<v Speaker 2>music and</v>
<v Speaker 2>her curry rock or whatever the hell it</v>

481
00:19:15.271 --> 00:19:16.104
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

482
00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:17.700
<v Speaker 2>and then she Indian?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

483
00:19:17.701 --> 00:19:18.810
<v Speaker 2>she was Indian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Her name was,</v>

484
00:19:18.811 --> 00:19:19.644
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chetna.</v>

485
00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:21.030
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to say her name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

486
00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:21.740
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

487
00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:23.670
<v Speaker 2>she'd been a disparaged her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's alive.</v>

488
00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:25.170
<v Speaker 2>She's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's stoked.</v>

489
00:19:25.171 --> 00:19:26.950
<v Speaker 2>She started to me a Christmas card.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

490
00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:27.871
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No two of us.</v>

491
00:19:27.871 --> 00:19:28.381
<v Speaker 2>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

492
00:19:28.381 --> 00:19:29.191
<v Speaker 2>Very cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

493
00:19:29.191 --> 00:19:30.780
<v Speaker 2>Switch card with her kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what happened?</v>

494
00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:33.930
<v Speaker 2>So then they get to her and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they start calling her momma.</v>

495
00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:34.620
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mama,</v>

496
00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:35.550
<v Speaker 2>Mama,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to wake up.</v>

497
00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:36.570
<v Speaker 2>You need to wake up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We didn't go.</v>

498
00:19:36.571 --> 00:19:37.261
<v Speaker 2>And she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

499
00:19:37.261 --> 00:19:38.190
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all in video.</v>

500
00:19:38.191 --> 00:19:39.540
<v Speaker 2>Like leave me alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Leave me alone.</v>

501
00:19:39.541 --> 00:19:40.970
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to do it.</v>

502
00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:43.890
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they put oxygen downer,</v>

503
00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:46.040
<v Speaker 2>crank up the bottle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>try to get some blood flowing,</v>

504
00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:48.900
<v Speaker 2>get stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They sit up there at 8,000 feet,</v>

505
00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:51.810
<v Speaker 2>35 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>45 minutes trying to Jesus trying to</v>

506
00:19:51.811 --> 00:19:52.650
<v Speaker 2>coax her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

507
00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:57.540
<v Speaker 2>Trying to coax her to get her down and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was it because of her personality</v>

508
00:19:57.541 --> 00:20:02.541
<v Speaker 2>or is it because she's so like so</v>
<v Speaker 2>diminished cognitively things go south</v>

509
00:20:04.711 --> 00:20:06.000
<v Speaker 2>to ride.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she was,</v>

510
00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:08.250
<v Speaker 2>she probably had pretty profound</v>
<v Speaker 2>cerebral edema.</v>

511
00:20:08.251 --> 00:20:10.650
<v Speaker 2>So her decision making was in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>toilet.</v>

512
00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:14.610
<v Speaker 2>So you become really apathetic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's impossible to carry someone down.</v>

513
00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:16.770
<v Speaker 2>You can't carry something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can lower them down,</v>

514
00:20:16.771 --> 00:20:17.880
<v Speaker 2>which is what happened.</v>

515
00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:20.490
<v Speaker 2>You can tie a rope to their harness and</v>
<v Speaker 2>short rope.</v>

516
00:20:20.491 --> 00:20:22.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm down with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

517
00:20:22.021 --> 00:20:23.850
<v Speaker 2>with two or three dudes like working</v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

518
00:20:23.851 --> 00:20:25.990
<v Speaker 2>really hard sort of loaner down and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

519
00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:27.900
<v Speaker 2>that's how they got her down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

520
00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:30.390
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she quit and a lot of people quit.</v>

521
00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:33.420
<v Speaker 2>I worked search and rescue in Alaska on</v>
<v Speaker 2>Denali for years and,</v>

522
00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:38.160
<v Speaker 2>and you'd be amazed at how many people</v>
<v Speaker 2>are just like done Tuesday,</v>

523
00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:42.360
<v Speaker 2>just lay down and they're done because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not rational enough to know.</v>

524
00:20:42.361 --> 00:20:45.750
<v Speaker 2>Like if I sit down and I just took just</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bitty nappy and getting back</v>

525
00:20:45.751 --> 00:20:47.230
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're taking the snow nap and you're</v>

526
00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:48.680
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

527
00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:49.430
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

528
00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:51.610
<v Speaker 2>it won't snow now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like that.</v>

529
00:20:51.611 --> 00:20:56.050
<v Speaker 2>So that's a weird term.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But with hypothermia,</v>

530
00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:58.960
<v Speaker 2>the interesting thing that happens is</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get euphoric,</v>

531
00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:00.820
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd go through this,</v>

532
00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:02.870
<v Speaker 2>this stage of super cold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>super cold,</v>

533
00:21:02.871 --> 00:21:06.250
<v Speaker 2>and then your core temperature drops low</v>
<v Speaker 2>enough to where euphoria comes in.</v>

534
00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:10.600
<v Speaker 2>So oftentimes it was same people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we would find our undressed.</v>

535
00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:12.310
<v Speaker 2>So you get hot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get warm.</v>

536
00:21:12.311 --> 00:21:16.210
<v Speaker 2>So their gloves come off the hats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pants andZ unzipped.</v>

537
00:21:16.211 --> 00:21:17.380
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's,</v>

538
00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:20.770
<v Speaker 2>everybody's buck naked on the side of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mountain right before they die,</v>

539
00:21:20.771 --> 00:21:22.380
<v Speaker 2>before they die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>

540
00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:26.210
<v Speaker 2>not that I want to go out that way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now I can think of worst way.</v>

541
00:21:26.211 --> 00:21:29.200
<v Speaker 2>So it gets you for it apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

542
00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:33.870
<v Speaker 2>Because we also pull people back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen multiple times when we pulled</v>

543
00:21:33.871 --> 00:21:37.450
<v Speaker 2>people back and they discussed that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they described it.</v>

544
00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:40.660
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then we start rewarming there,</v>

545
00:21:40.661 --> 00:21:42.990
<v Speaker 2>frostbite and shit's not right after</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

546
00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:44.920
<v Speaker 2>That hurts out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That hurt.</v>

547
00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:49.390
<v Speaker 2>Frostbite is so horrible to look at too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just shoot this stuff we had to see</v>

548
00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:53.040
<v Speaker 2>and her fingers are still half,</v>
<v Speaker 2>half fingers are off her.</v>

549
00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:54.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She sent me pictures.</v>

550
00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:56.530
<v Speaker 2>She's missing fingers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Missing tips.</v>

551
00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:57.700
<v Speaker 2>Tips.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

552
00:21:57.790 --> 00:22:01.100
<v Speaker 2>she's lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of the Phalanges are gone chopped</v>

553
00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:02.440
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they got her down.</v>

554
00:22:02.441 --> 00:22:05.890
<v Speaker 2>They ended up hours and hours and hours</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're tracking and where we're</v>

555
00:22:05.891 --> 00:22:08.290
<v Speaker 2>trying to talk to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get her down to camp four.</v>

556
00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:12.430
<v Speaker 2>What does that track that you saw then?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The trickiest part as he'll tell you,</v>

557
00:22:12.431 --> 00:22:15.400
<v Speaker 2>cause I can't tell you can't afford a</v>
<v Speaker 2>camp three.</v>

558
00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:21.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah I can't afford a cam three and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>camp three to camp two which they didn't</v>

559
00:22:21.221 --> 00:22:22.240
<v Speaker 2>even do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They couldn't get,</v>

560
00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:26.020
<v Speaker 2>they couldn't get to camp two which is</v>
<v Speaker 2>straight on the lhotse face.</v>

561
00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:27.160
<v Speaker 2>Lhotse face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

562
00:22:27.170 --> 00:22:31.900
<v Speaker 2>it's about a 60 60 degree ice face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is slick.</v>

563
00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:34.720
<v Speaker 2>So when you're roping somebody down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

564
00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:36.940
<v Speaker 2>it actually does provide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

565
00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:39.550
<v Speaker 2>less friction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can actually slot somebody down but</v>

566
00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:43.690
<v Speaker 2>you can't get going too fast cause you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

567
00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:47.910
<v Speaker 2>so now you're at 25206207000 feet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're 130 pounds,</v>

568
00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:52.980
<v Speaker 2>125 pounds shirt and you get a lower</v>
<v Speaker 2>this 200 pound lady down hard oxygen.</v>

569
00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:54.510
<v Speaker 2>And these guys are working there and</v>
<v Speaker 2>met.</v>

570
00:22:54.511 --> 00:22:56.170
<v Speaker 2>She's 200 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

571
00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:58.780
<v Speaker 2>she wasn't that big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

572
00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:03.520
<v Speaker 2>with all our gear and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was 160 170 pounds worth of weight,</v>

573
00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:04.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dead weight,</v>

574
00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:07.750
<v Speaker 2>lower down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we got her down,</v>

575
00:23:07.751 --> 00:23:11.410
<v Speaker 2>we got her down to where we could go in</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the helicopter and we picked her up</v>

576
00:23:11.411 --> 00:23:15.040
<v Speaker 2>and took her back down to base camp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was when the meeting took place</v>

577
00:23:15.041 --> 00:23:18.480
<v Speaker 2>between her and her husband.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The tearful rejoicing and no though.</v>

578
00:23:18.481 --> 00:23:20.650
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the part you missed was the helicopter</v>

579
00:23:20.651 --> 00:23:22.270
<v Speaker 2>landed it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it couldn't land at camp two.</v>

580
00:23:22.271 --> 00:23:26.140
<v Speaker 2>We weren't supposed to go up to 23,500</v>
<v Speaker 2>which at the base of low t a crampon</v>

581
00:23:26.141 --> 00:23:28.990
<v Speaker 2>point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Andrew got there and said,</v>

582
00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:32.440
<v Speaker 2>I can only pick one of you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she looked at her husband and said,</v>

583
00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:37.420
<v Speaker 2>you stay until he made him stay and take</v>
<v Speaker 2>the next helicopter out.</v>

584
00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:40.150
<v Speaker 2>So we got her down and she looked at her</v>
<v Speaker 2>husband and said,</v>

585
00:23:40.151 --> 00:23:41.530
<v Speaker 2>you stay like pitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You quit.</v>

586
00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:44.500
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was mad because he got left.</v>

587
00:23:44.770 --> 00:23:47.000
<v Speaker 2>She was pissed off that she was pissed</v>
<v Speaker 2>that she got left,</v>

588
00:23:47.001 --> 00:23:50.780
<v Speaker 2>but he couldn't have carried her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Knowing that you're switching it</v>

589
00:23:50.781 --> 00:23:52.820
<v Speaker 2>depends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's ways of looking at it both ways.</v>

590
00:23:52.821 --> 00:23:54.980
<v Speaker 2>Somebody quit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody gave up,</v>

591
00:23:54.981 --> 00:23:56.660
<v Speaker 2>somebody said no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean who knows?</v>

592
00:23:56.900 --> 00:24:00.350
<v Speaker 2>But I'm sure they had to go sue through</v>
<v Speaker 2>some deep ass therapy when they got</v>

593
00:24:00.351 --> 00:24:00.981
<v Speaker 2>home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

594
00:24:00.981 --> 00:24:03.680
<v Speaker 2>So I'm gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to fill in the gaps here.</v>

595
00:24:03.681 --> 00:24:08.681
<v Speaker 2>So fast forward a nine or 10 months and</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

596
00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:12.470
<v Speaker 2>husband has a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has a heart attack and das.</v>

597
00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:15.110
<v Speaker 2>So he died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>

598
00:24:15.111 --> 00:24:16.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't be laughing.</v>

599
00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:19.780
<v Speaker 2>That's Kinda fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is good.</v>

600
00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:22.400
<v Speaker 2>Fucked up man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on Everest.</v>

601
00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:24.830
<v Speaker 2>And then you fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what's the Karma though?</v>

602
00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:26.030
<v Speaker 2>They left her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

603
00:24:27.410 --> 00:24:29.900
<v Speaker 2>what is he going to do if he doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>leave her?</v>

604
00:24:29.901 --> 00:24:31.700
<v Speaker 2>What does he do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>These sits out there with her.</v>

605
00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:34.560
<v Speaker 2>He had told people that she's up there</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she's panicked.</v>

606
00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:36.380
<v Speaker 2>She was panicking on the phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was there.</v>

607
00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:37.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

608
00:24:37.341 --> 00:24:38.690
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we talked about it last night,</v>

609
00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:41.510
<v Speaker 2>the romantic story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You huddle up with your girl and you're</v>

610
00:24:41.511 --> 00:24:42.910
<v Speaker 2>going to die together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

611
00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:44.031
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

612
00:24:44.031 --> 00:24:45.260
<v Speaker 2>or you get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go down there,</v>

613
00:24:45.261 --> 00:24:48.170
<v Speaker 2>tried to get her saved and you get rid</v>
<v Speaker 2>of killed for leaving.</v>

614
00:24:48.410 --> 00:24:52.070
<v Speaker 2>It's easy to Monday morning quarterback</v>
<v Speaker 2>any of those situations because all bets</v>

615
00:24:52.071 --> 00:24:54.710
<v Speaker 2>off when you get above 26,000 feet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

616
00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:56.510
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>

617
00:24:56.511 --> 00:24:58.820
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're kind of hanging on a little bit</v>

618
00:24:58.850 --> 00:24:59.820
<v Speaker 2>and that's why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

619
00:24:59.821 --> 00:25:03.620
<v Speaker 2>you get these big into thinner stories</v>
<v Speaker 2>that happen and no one really can</v>

620
00:25:03.621 --> 00:25:06.500
<v Speaker 2>remember exactly the details and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

621
00:25:06.501 --> 00:25:08.630
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a little bit sketchy.</v>

622
00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:11.210
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I in my intentions were,</v>

623
00:25:11.211 --> 00:25:12.710
<v Speaker 2>and I did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you did.</v>

624
00:25:12.711 --> 00:25:16.080
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>summit notes and 26,000,</v>

625
00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:19.580
<v Speaker 2>26,000 foot peaks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's always,</v>

626
00:25:20.150 --> 00:25:23.600
<v Speaker 2>there's always variables that come into</v>
<v Speaker 2>play and it turns into theater.</v>

627
00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:26.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a stage who even make choices.</v>

628
00:25:26.751 --> 00:25:28.970
<v Speaker 2>People make mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had one guy on,</v>

629
00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:29.923
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

630
00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:32.390
<v Speaker 2>what's her face again?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Grace's team.</v>

631
00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:34.100
<v Speaker 2>He was a triathlete.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He went up,</v>

632
00:25:34.670 --> 00:25:38.010
<v Speaker 2>broke a bunch of rules respectfully.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

633
00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:41.930
<v Speaker 2>with regards to climatization stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Commonization pushed himself too much.</v>

634
00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:44.390
<v Speaker 2>Summited,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got back down and died in his tent.</v>

635
00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:47.300
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his fifth attempt up there.</v>

636
00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:48.740
<v Speaker 2>You can look it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's on the end of that.</v>

637
00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:52.670
<v Speaker 2>His fifth attempt up there pushed</v>
<v Speaker 2>himself way too hard rule.</v>

638
00:25:52.671 --> 00:25:54.620
<v Speaker 2>The rules are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't make it to a certain point</v>

639
00:25:54.621 --> 00:25:56.660
<v Speaker 2>by a certain time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should turn around and save your</v>

640
00:25:56.661 --> 00:25:58.220
<v Speaker 2>life and come back another day.</v>

641
00:25:58.220 --> 00:25:59.053
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

642
00:25:59.210 --> 00:25:59.601
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

643
00:25:59.601 --> 00:26:01.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm pushing through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got to the summit too late.</v>

644
00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:03.860
<v Speaker 2>Came back really exhausted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>16,</v>

645
00:26:03.861 --> 00:26:05.570
<v Speaker 2>17 hour day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>died in the tent.</v>

646
00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:08.150
<v Speaker 2>He was 35 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did he die from?</v>

647
00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:10.880
<v Speaker 2>Exposure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cerebral Edema.</v>

648
00:26:10.910 --> 00:26:12.590
<v Speaker 2>He might've thrown a clot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could.</v>

649
00:26:12.591 --> 00:26:13.191
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

650
00:26:13.191 --> 00:26:15.440
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the autopsy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean he,</v>

651
00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:17.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was something fairly acute,</v>

652
00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:19.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't just exhaustion,</v>

653
00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:20.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't just hypothermia.</v>

654
00:26:20.610 --> 00:26:23.960
<v Speaker 2>He made it back to the tent and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>just expired in the tent.</v>

655
00:26:24.050 --> 00:26:25.270
<v Speaker 2>So not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's,</v>

656
00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:29.600
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of things that can go</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong and you have a small window to get</v>

657
00:26:29.601 --> 00:26:31.790
<v Speaker 2>it right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is good about it?</v>

658
00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:35.330
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was something big ass mountain.</v>

659
00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:36.213
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

660
00:26:36.250 --> 00:26:38.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a tough question.</v>

661
00:26:38.211 --> 00:26:40.760
<v Speaker 2>It's a pretty nebulous thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very subjective.</v>

662
00:26:40.761 --> 00:26:42.980
<v Speaker 2>It's very selfish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>

663
00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:44.070
<v Speaker 2>there's no chance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used</v>

664
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:49.070
<v Speaker 3>to climb pretty hard and then I had a</v>
<v Speaker 3>kid and my sense of objective risk</v>

665
00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:56.310
<v Speaker 3>changed significantly at that point</v>
<v Speaker 3>because climbing by nature is a very</v>

666
00:26:56.311 --> 00:27:00.690
<v Speaker 3>selfish pursuit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going out there to do something</v>

667
00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:05.190
<v Speaker 3>that is bring,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it brings me joy and it brings me</v>

668
00:27:05.191 --> 00:27:10.191
<v Speaker 3>fulfillment and it gives me a sense of</v>
<v Speaker 3>connection to the people that I'm</v>

669
00:27:10.801 --> 00:27:13.710
<v Speaker 3>sharing a rope with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause we're on a rope man.</v>

670
00:27:13.711 --> 00:27:14.760
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to win together,</v>

671
00:27:14.761 --> 00:27:16.140
<v Speaker 3>lose together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

672
00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:19.410
<v Speaker 3>but jeff doesn't do that selfishly and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you give all these climate shit,</v>

673
00:27:19.411 --> 00:27:22.080
<v Speaker 3>like that's a very selfish thing to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>for him.</v>

674
00:27:22.081 --> 00:27:24.930
<v Speaker 3>But he did it because Eric did it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eric wanted to do it.</v>

675
00:27:25.290 --> 00:27:26.123
<v Speaker 3>So he like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

676
00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:28.170
<v Speaker 3>you're a selfish prick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You summited Everest.</v>

677
00:27:28.171 --> 00:27:28.591
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

678
00:27:28.591 --> 00:27:30.480
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've helped my blind friend go to the</v>

679
00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:31.950
<v Speaker 3>state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It really wasn't his goal,</v>

680
00:27:31.951 --> 00:27:35.250
<v Speaker 3>his goal to help the first blind guy and</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody on my team.</v>

681
00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:38.070
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't just me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had an amazing team that was there</v>

682
00:27:38.071 --> 00:27:38.940
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

683
00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:41.670
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with all our Sherpas on summit day,</v>

684
00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:44.760
<v Speaker 3>we were 19 of us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And at that point,</v>

685
00:27:44.761 --> 00:27:49.170
<v Speaker 3>I think this record still stands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're still the highest number from one</v>

686
00:27:49.171 --> 00:27:51.510
<v Speaker 3>team and one day to stand on top</v>
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>

687
00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:57.350
<v Speaker 3>And I attribute that to the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 3>just as you said by like that was just a</v>

688
00:27:57.841 --> 00:28:01.830
<v Speaker 3>bunch of Bros who weren't commercially</v>
<v Speaker 3>God and we were just friends and we were</v>

689
00:28:01.831 --> 00:28:03.540
<v Speaker 3>there for something that was bigger than</v>
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>

690
00:28:03.541 --> 00:28:06.240
<v Speaker 3>We were there for Eric.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We wanted to get him as high up as we</v>

691
00:28:06.241 --> 00:28:08.820
<v Speaker 3>could and getting back down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if that meant the summit,</v>

692
00:28:08.850 --> 00:28:09.750
<v Speaker 3>awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If not,</v>

693
00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:14.220
<v Speaker 3>we'll come back and we'll still be bros</v>
<v Speaker 3>and maybe we'll go do some other cool</v>

694
00:28:14.221 --> 00:28:15.054
<v Speaker 3>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

695
00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:20.480
<v Speaker 3>So what happens when you don't go up</v>
<v Speaker 3>there for me to plant my flag is we've</v>

696
00:28:21.231 --> 00:28:21.830
<v Speaker 3>got the summit.</v>

697
00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:23.310
<v Speaker 3>I got to stand on top.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

698
00:28:23.311 --> 00:28:25.230
<v Speaker 3>it was pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty cool.</v>

699
00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:27.930
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is the feeling like when you get to</v>

700
00:28:27.931 --> 00:28:32.931
<v Speaker 3>that top and you realize that you have</v>
<v Speaker 3>summited Mount Everest well up there and</v>

701
00:28:33.301 --> 00:28:35.880
<v Speaker 3>you're looking around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like holy shit.</v>

702
00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:38.340
<v Speaker 3>Top of the World Ma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

703
00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:44.280
<v Speaker 3>just like so many other times with him</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the stuff that I've done with Eric,</v>

704
00:28:44.850 --> 00:28:47.580
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was worried about him getting down.</v>

705
00:28:47.610 --> 00:28:50.520
<v Speaker 3>That's all I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was obsessing on it because there was</v>

706
00:28:50.521 --> 00:28:52.590
<v Speaker 3>a storm coming in and we heard all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>radio check.</v>

707
00:28:52.591 --> 00:28:55.050
<v Speaker 3>How much time do you have a storm?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

708
00:28:55.070 --> 00:29:00.070
<v Speaker 3>shit is barreling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it is moving quick from the uh,</v>

709
00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:03.660
<v Speaker 3>from Tibet across,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we could see it coming and it was</v>

710
00:29:03.661 --> 00:29:05.070
<v Speaker 3>probably nine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10 in the morning.</v>

711
00:29:05.490 --> 00:29:06.870
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's early.</v>

712
00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:10.230
<v Speaker 3>And when it comes out early and monsoon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the edge of the monsoons is late.</v>

713
00:29:10.390 --> 00:29:12.300
<v Speaker 3>The monsoon starts to pick up in late</v>
<v Speaker 3>May.</v>

714
00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:14.970
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to be anywhere near,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Joe,</v>

715
00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:16.750
<v Speaker 3>you talked about all the time the</v>
<v Speaker 3>adrenaline dump.</v>

716
00:29:16.751 --> 00:29:20.250
<v Speaker 3>So imagine generals dump in a cage and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you talk about all the time now you just</v>

717
00:29:20.251 --> 00:29:22.230
<v Speaker 3>summited Mount Everest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're only halfway done.</v>

718
00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:26.940
<v Speaker 3>8% of all matt mountaineering accidents</v>
<v Speaker 3>happen on the decent.</v>

719
00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:28.940
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He must sas.</v>

720
00:29:29.170 --> 00:29:30.150
<v Speaker 3>That's why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is that?</v>

721
00:29:30.151 --> 00:29:33.260
<v Speaker 3>Because your decision making comp has</v>
<v Speaker 3>compromised and Yup.</v>

722
00:29:33.330 --> 00:29:33.900
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

723
00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:36.120
<v Speaker 3>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you did what you went to do.</v>

724
00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:37.740
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

725
00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:39.080
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's fuck.</v>

726
00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:41.950
<v Speaker 3>Can you relax your adrenaline?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You like,</v>

727
00:29:41.951 --> 00:29:43.300
<v Speaker 3>I did it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And all of a sudden they're like,</v>

728
00:29:43.330 --> 00:29:44.200
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get down.</v>

729
00:29:44.201 --> 00:29:46.150
<v Speaker 3>That's why more technical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be honest with you,</v>

730
00:29:46.570 --> 00:29:49.360
<v Speaker 3>that's somewhat of a rookie move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

731
00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:50.080
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

732
00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:52.840
<v Speaker 3>experienced climbers always know to have</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little bit more in the tank.</v>

733
00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:54.130
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just like a fighter,</v>

734
00:29:54.131 --> 00:29:54.730
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

735
00:29:54.730 --> 00:29:56.170
<v Speaker 3>you've got to save some for the fifth</v>
<v Speaker 3>round,</v>

736
00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:57.820
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you got to,</v>

737
00:29:57.910 --> 00:30:00.220
<v Speaker 3>you got to know that it's coming and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's gonna hurt.</v>

738
00:30:01.390 --> 00:30:02.800
<v Speaker 3>It's gonna hurt bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

739
00:30:02.801 --> 00:30:06.460
<v Speaker 3>I remember my legs like I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were jelly man.</v>

740
00:30:06.490 --> 00:30:08.020
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tried to come down from the Hillary</v>

741
00:30:08.021 --> 00:30:12.250
<v Speaker 3>stuff and I was just jacked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like the gumby man coming down and</v>

742
00:30:12.251 --> 00:30:15.370
<v Speaker 3>I actually fell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I fell onto a fixed drope right.</v>

743
00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:17.610
<v Speaker 3>Right below them or right above the</v>
<v Speaker 3>hillary step.</v>

744
00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:19.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I got caught by a rope and it was</v>

745
00:30:19.931 --> 00:30:22.120
<v Speaker 3>one of the only times I clipped in that</v>
<v Speaker 3>whole day.</v>

746
00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:24.200
<v Speaker 3>Oh Jeez.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

747
00:30:24.550 --> 00:30:27.130
<v Speaker 3>it was Kooky Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you clip in cause you felt like your</v>

748
00:30:27.131 --> 00:30:29.110
<v Speaker 3>body was getting wishy washy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's again,</v>

749
00:30:29.111 --> 00:30:32.680
<v Speaker 3>I knew like a little bit not ride.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've shot my shot,</v>

750
00:30:32.681 --> 00:30:33.770
<v Speaker 3>my wad coming up.</v>

751
00:30:33.770 --> 00:30:36.340
<v Speaker 3>I dug some ropes out with my buddy Brad</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bull,</v>

752
00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:37.720
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the team.</v>

753
00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:41.020
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>earlier that that morning that were</v>

754
00:30:41.021 --> 00:30:43.120
<v Speaker 3>buried.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were the first people up.</v>

755
00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:45.820
<v Speaker 3>I mean we were the first people up and</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these reps were buried and we were</v>

756
00:30:45.821 --> 00:30:49.450
<v Speaker 3>digging them out in the ice and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>were buried under a foot to two foot of</v>

757
00:30:49.451 --> 00:30:52.600
<v Speaker 3>snow at 20,000 feet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I made Brad and I made that decision</v>

758
00:30:52.601 --> 00:30:56.410
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to dig those ropes out because not to</v>

759
00:30:56.411 --> 00:30:58.930
<v Speaker 3>know which way to go up but to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to make sure they were there for the</v>

760
00:30:58.931 --> 00:31:01.750
<v Speaker 3>decent cause.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's when the weather comes in.</v>

761
00:31:01.751 --> 00:31:03.670
<v Speaker 3>And that's when the blind lead the blind</v>
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>

762
00:31:03.671 --> 00:31:04.081
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

763
00:31:04.081 --> 00:31:08.800
<v Speaker 3>so we dug the ropes up and I knew when I</v>
<v Speaker 3>did that,</v>

764
00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:11.680
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I was going to be out of gas and</v>

765
00:31:11.681 --> 00:31:13.600
<v Speaker 3>sure enough like coming down I knew it.</v>

766
00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:17.500
<v Speaker 3>So that's when I was clipping it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was a little bit,</v>

767
00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:20.480
<v Speaker 3>it was a little bit more fastidious on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

768
00:31:20.530 --> 00:31:23.050
<v Speaker 3>making sure if I fell that I'd be</v>
<v Speaker 3>caught.</v>

769
00:31:23.230 --> 00:31:25.300
<v Speaker 3>Sure enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>

770
00:31:25.301 --> 00:31:27.670
<v Speaker 3>On the rope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they got back on and was like good.</v>

771
00:31:27.910 --> 00:31:29.650
<v Speaker 3>That woke me up and up and you get a</v>
<v Speaker 3>jolt.</v>

772
00:31:29.910 --> 00:31:31.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shake it off or look around.</v>

773
00:31:31.970 --> 00:31:32.591
<v Speaker 3>I've got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>damn,</v>

774
00:31:32.591 --> 00:31:35.410
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if everybody saw that and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>started at that.</v>

775
00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:37.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So is it the appeal of like</v>

776
00:31:37.810 --> 00:31:41.470
<v Speaker 3>accomplishing some of the very few</v>
<v Speaker 3>people accomplish and joining like a</v>

777
00:31:41.471 --> 00:31:43.710
<v Speaker 3>very special club?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause I what,</v>

778
00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:47.200
<v Speaker 3>what motivates these people?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it just a really difficult task and</v>

779
00:31:47.201 --> 00:31:48.460
<v Speaker 3>they want to see if they have it in</v>
<v Speaker 3>them?</v>

780
00:31:48.490 --> 00:31:50.230
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously everybody's got a subjective</v>

781
00:31:50.231 --> 00:31:52.180
<v Speaker 3>answer to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And mine is,</v>

782
00:31:52.181 --> 00:31:54.880
<v Speaker 3>I liked to be with my people in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>hills.</v>

783
00:31:54.910 --> 00:31:56.620
<v Speaker 3>That's my church.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where I feel the most</v>

784
00:31:56.621 --> 00:32:00.400
<v Speaker 3>comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's where I feel safe actually in the</v>

785
00:32:00.401 --> 00:32:01.210
<v Speaker 3>hills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

786
00:32:01.210 --> 00:32:04.930
<v Speaker 3>And you're around other very rugged</v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

787
00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:07.000
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just people who make good decisions,</v>

788
00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:08.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then,</v>

789
00:32:08.370 --> 00:32:08.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

790
00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:13.910
<v Speaker 3>the cathedral of the big mountains makes</v>
<v Speaker 3>me happy and sort of rejuvenate my soul</v>

791
00:32:14.721 --> 00:32:16.930
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's,</v>

792
00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:20.980
<v Speaker 3>there's something to be said for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for seeing what my body and my mind can</v>

793
00:32:20.981 --> 00:32:22.430
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

794
00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:26.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that a lot of people would,</v>

795
00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:28.710
<v Speaker 3>would agree that that's probably one of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

796
00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:31.150
<v Speaker 3>the main reasons why we get out and do</v>
<v Speaker 3>these things.</v>

797
00:32:31.151 --> 00:32:32.830
<v Speaker 3>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's no joke.</v>

798
00:32:32.831 --> 00:32:34.060
<v Speaker 3>It's dangerous man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

799
00:32:34.690 --> 00:32:38.020
<v Speaker 3>you saw one of the most accomplished</v>
<v Speaker 3>mountaineers that probably the best</v>

800
00:32:38.021 --> 00:32:39.830
<v Speaker 3>mountaineer in the world just died,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

801
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:42.410
<v Speaker 2>under two months ago you will lay stack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

802
00:32:42.490 --> 00:32:44.150
<v Speaker 2>How did he die?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He fell.</v>

803
00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:47.690
<v Speaker 2>He was getting ready to go do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's trained and up in the,</v>

804
00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:51.680
<v Speaker 2>in the valley and that Western coon from</v>
<v Speaker 2>that camp two on Everest that you saw</v>

805
00:32:51.681 --> 00:32:52.790
<v Speaker 2>that image.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

806
00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:57.170
<v Speaker 2>he was going up the west shoulder of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everest with one other Sherpa who was a</v>

807
00:32:57.171 --> 00:33:00.290
<v Speaker 2>friend of his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just a page Sherp it was as calming</v>

808

<v Speaker 2>as strong as he could be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

843
00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:28.320
<v Speaker 2>technically capable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

845
00:34:29.910 --> 00:34:32.510

<v Speaker 2>people died trying to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to do Everest.</v>

847
00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:38.720
<v Speaker 2>The second seconded one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a good handful.</v>

848
00:34:38.721 --> 00:34:41.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't know exact numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but several from different</v>

849
00:34:41.091 --> 00:34:44.540
<v Speaker 2>nationalities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So everybody is either failed or died</v>

850
00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:49.010
<v Speaker 2>except one person who's the one person</v>
<v Speaker 2>to two Americans that was willie unsold,</v>

851
00:34:49.011 --> 00:34:50.510
<v Speaker 2>Tom Hornbein.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what they do.</v>

852
00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:52.910
<v Speaker 2>The ones they summit once the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once the climbers are in it,</v>

853
00:34:52.911 --> 00:34:53.744
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

854
00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:55.910
<v Speaker 2>humans in general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these climbers do it.</v>

855
00:34:55.911 --> 00:34:58.580
<v Speaker 2>Then they want to find a more difficult</v>
<v Speaker 2>route where they do with that oxygen.</v>

856
00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:02.750
<v Speaker 2>So Uli was going to go up and do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This fucking guy is going to go do that</v>

857
00:35:02.751 --> 00:35:06.500
<v Speaker 2>and then come around summit everest and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then go check that out dude.</v>

858
00:35:06.501 --> 00:35:08.700
<v Speaker 2>He's like a fucking goat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at this.</v>

859
00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:10.940
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's incredible.</v>

860
00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:11.990
<v Speaker 2>So his aerobic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

861
00:35:11.991 --> 00:35:14.150
<v Speaker 2>he's got that ability to kick out the</v>
<v Speaker 2>lactic acid.</v>

862
00:35:14.450 --> 00:35:17.270
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is insane.</v>

863

<v Speaker 2>he's an absolute beast.</v>

864
00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:20.300
<v Speaker 2>It's a shame.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a big loss.</v>

865
00:35:20.330 --> 00:35:22.340
<v Speaker 2>It's just because he's been doing it for</v>
<v Speaker 2>so long.</v>

866
00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:26.150
<v Speaker 2>Shit,</v>

870
00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:33.860
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>T.</v>

874
00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:38.700
<v Speaker 2>E.</v>
<v Speaker 2>C.</v>

875
00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:39.900
<v Speaker 2>K.</v>
<v Speaker 2>New speed record,</v>

876
00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:43.860
<v Speaker 2>Uyghur 2015.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is the north face of the eiger.</v>

877
00:35:44.370 --> 00:35:47.760
<v Speaker 2>And so he's a Swiss dude and he grew up</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of cut his teeth in the Alps and</v>

878
00:35:47.761 --> 00:35:50.760
<v Speaker 2>just all this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to be clear though,</v>

879
00:35:51.090 --> 00:35:54.030
<v Speaker 2>this is that this isn't like the first</v>
<v Speaker 2>time he did this right.</v>

880
00:35:54.030 --> 00:35:57.570
<v Speaker 2>It's probably the 50th time he climbed</v>
<v Speaker 2>that route and he did it over and over</v>

881
00:35:57.571 --> 00:35:58.800
<v Speaker 2>and over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got it dialed,</v>

882
00:35:58.801 --> 00:36:01.800
<v Speaker 2>figured it out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then went out and did these speed</v>

883
00:36:01.801 --> 00:36:02.950
<v Speaker 2>records,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

884
00:36:02.951 --> 00:36:06.070
<v Speaker 2>and set these big writers very similar</v>
<v Speaker 2>to what just happened on El Cap.</v>

885
00:36:06.071 --> 00:36:07.570
<v Speaker 2>Cathy Tan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>the podcast for.</v>

00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:16.771
<v Speaker 2>Alex has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

892

<v Speaker 2>So would he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is what he did,</v>

893
00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:22.140
<v Speaker 2>what he did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and my,</v>

894
00:36:22.141 --> 00:36:26.580
<v Speaker 2>my great way was like landing on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>moon,</v>

895
00:36:26.581 --> 00:36:27.760
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the,</v>

896
00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:32.960
<v Speaker 2>the ability to pocket fear and just</v>
<v Speaker 2>focus on the three square feet in front</v>

897
00:36:35.971 --> 00:36:39.370
<v Speaker 2>of you on paralleled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

898
00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:42.250
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've climbed El cap and I just</v>

899
00:36:42.450 --> 00:36:46.210
<v Speaker 2>can't imagine being up on those slats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How long did it take you when you find</v>

900
00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:47.550
<v Speaker 2>oh cap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three days.</v>

901
00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:51.000
<v Speaker 2>So three days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it can four hours free soloed that</v>

902
00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:53.820
<v Speaker 2>deploy ulay people look at that and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

903
00:36:53.821 --> 00:36:56.580
<v Speaker 2>well it's just got super sweaty on mine</v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't mine are too by the way.</v>

904
00:36:56.670 --> 00:36:57.503
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that,</v>

905
00:36:57.570 --> 00:37:00.390
<v Speaker 2>so if they look at you and you see this</v>
<v Speaker 2>video and you're like,</v>

906
00:37:00.391 --> 00:37:01.230
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's crazy.</v>

907
00:37:01.231 --> 00:37:04.170
<v Speaker 2>He's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now he's calculated and so is Alex.</v>

908
00:37:04.171 --> 00:37:07.260
<v Speaker 2>Alex super calculate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he'd climbed free rider the route</v>

909
00:37:07.261 --> 00:37:12.261
<v Speaker 2>that he did a few weeks ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did it several dozen times and would</v>

910
00:37:12.361 --> 00:37:15.120
<v Speaker 2>fall on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

911
00:37:15.121 --> 00:37:20.121
<v Speaker 2>with a rope and he just was in the right</v>
<v Speaker 2>headspace that day and went up and did</v>

912
00:37:21.241 --> 00:37:23.430
<v Speaker 2>it without a whole lot of pomp and</v>
<v Speaker 2>circumstance.</v>

913
00:37:23.431 --> 00:37:25.880
<v Speaker 2>Just went out and nailed it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at this.</v>

914
00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:28.260
<v Speaker 2>There's going to be a crazy ass video</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Jimmy Chin,</v>

915
00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:29.970
<v Speaker 2>Jimmy was shooting it and his tea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

916
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.070
<v Speaker 2>Jimmy was near the top with no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what did he,</v>

917
00:37:32.290 --> 00:37:35.250
<v Speaker 2>did he shoot it like next to him with</v>
<v Speaker 2>ropes and,</v>

918
00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:35.550
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

919
00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:38.220
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so Jimmy was very respectful of not</v>

920
00:37:38.221 --> 00:37:41.250
<v Speaker 2>getting in his way because this is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>very obviously very intense thing.</v>

921
00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:43.440
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how's it going?</v>

922

<v Speaker 2>I missed the shot.</v>

924
00:37:48.091 --> 00:37:49.830
<v Speaker 2>Can you go back up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey Man,</v>

925
00:37:49.831 --> 00:37:54.240
<v Speaker 2>can you give me a thumbs up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Selfie governance smile.</v>

926
00:37:54.330 --> 00:37:57.570
<v Speaker 2>But Jimmy is a very accomplished climber</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's an amazing set of a dog.</v>

927
00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:01.170
<v Speaker 2>Jimmy Chin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>National Geographic [inaudible] top.</v>

928
00:38:01.350 --> 00:38:03.120
<v Speaker 2>And he was at the top and him and his</v>
<v Speaker 2>team,</v>

929
00:38:03.121 --> 00:38:06.960
<v Speaker 2>I think lower down and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and yeah,</v>

930
00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:09.320
<v Speaker 2>greatest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>greatest athletic human feat.</v>

931
00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:13.720
<v Speaker 2>I ain't going to lie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to agree because it's,</v>

932
00:38:13.830 --> 00:38:18.830
<v Speaker 2>if you think about true athletic feats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not just obviously the,</v>

933
00:38:19.290 --> 00:38:21.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the core poral sort of,</v>

934
00:38:22.070 --> 00:38:23.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>event.</v>

935
00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:28.400
<v Speaker 2>It's just the whole mixed bag of who you</v>
<v Speaker 2>are as an athlete mentally,</v>

936
00:38:28.861 --> 00:38:30.510
<v Speaker 2>emotionally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>behaviorally,</v>

937
00:38:30.511 --> 00:38:33.300
<v Speaker 2>physically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how you execute in the moment when shit</v>

938
00:38:33.301 --> 00:38:36.160
<v Speaker 2>is just on point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like right in your face.</v>

939
00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:39.490
<v Speaker 3>And he did it like to this level that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't even,</v>

940
00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:43.180
<v Speaker 3>it's unbelievable man ripping out of my</v>
<v Speaker 3>hands.</v>

941
00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:46.900
<v Speaker 3>I mean these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean once you get 30 feet off the</v>

942
00:38:46.901 --> 00:38:48.550
<v Speaker 3>deck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's game on you man.</v>

943
00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:51.070
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then now put,</v>

944
00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:52.600
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a power of a hundred on that,</v>

945
00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:55.630
<v Speaker 3>but there's very few sports where one</v>
<v Speaker 3>mess up,</v>

946
00:38:55.631 --> 00:38:56.464
<v Speaker 3>you're dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

947
00:38:56.580 --> 00:39:01.140
<v Speaker 1>Does he have any like guys that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to be the next Alex honnold that</v>

948
00:39:01.141 --> 00:39:02.160
<v Speaker 1>are chasing him?</v>

949
00:39:02.210 --> 00:39:04.910
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just read something today this morning</v>

950
00:39:04.911 --> 00:39:08.480
<v Speaker 3>about the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there could be some emulators,</v>

951
00:39:09.290 --> 00:39:10.730
<v Speaker 3>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who knows?</v>

952
00:39:10.731 --> 00:39:14.000
<v Speaker 3>There's other super tough badass</v>
<v Speaker 3>climbers that are out there that are</v>

953
00:39:14.001 --> 00:39:16.340
<v Speaker 3>also free solo on and doing shit without</v>
<v Speaker 3>ropes.</v>

954
00:39:16.341 --> 00:39:20.360
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's at another level and everyone knows</v>

955
00:39:20.361 --> 00:39:21.310
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

956
00:39:21.330 --> 00:39:23.570
<v Speaker 3>there's this other low,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well first of all,</v>

957
00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:26.210
<v Speaker 3>like what is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what separates him?</v>

958
00:39:26.450 --> 00:39:29.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well there's a lot of body chemistry</v>

959
00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:34.180
<v Speaker 3>that that is sort of a mystery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how does his pituitary,</v>

960
00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:37.790
<v Speaker 3>how does his adrenal gland not just</v>
<v Speaker 3>flame out?</v>

961
00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:42.260
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How does he control that in a way that I</v>

962
00:39:42.261 --> 00:39:44.020
<v Speaker 3>can't write?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

963
00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:44.630
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

964
00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:47.120
<v Speaker 3>we're sitting here at the desk and my</v>
<v Speaker 3>hands are sweaty just thinking about it.</v>

965
00:39:47.121 --> 00:39:49.730
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there he is as calm and collected as</v>

966
00:39:49.731 --> 00:39:51.740
<v Speaker 3>he can be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've done studies on,</v>

967
00:39:51.770 --> 00:39:53.540
<v Speaker 3>on Alex,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they brought him in and like,</v>

968
00:39:53.541 --> 00:39:55.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>buzzed his brains like where are you,</v>

969
00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:56.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>chemically,</v>

970
00:39:57.470 --> 00:40:02.470
<v Speaker 3>biochemically when we introduce,</v>
<v Speaker 3>introduce assaulting sort of variables</v>

971
00:40:02.511 --> 00:40:07.511
<v Speaker 3>on you and he's just flatlined.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he's the perfect blend of</v>

972
00:40:07.950 --> 00:40:12.950
<v Speaker 3>biochemistry and physical capacity but</v>
<v Speaker 3>also devotion and commitment to his</v>

973
00:40:14.301 --> 00:40:15.200
<v Speaker 3>craft.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

974
00:40:15.201 --> 00:40:16.130
<v Speaker 3>he's an artist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

975
00:40:16.131 --> 00:40:16.940
<v Speaker 3>That's so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he,</v>

976
00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:18.920
<v Speaker 3>he got down from that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from that climb that day,</v>

977
00:40:18.921 --> 00:40:20.630
<v Speaker 3>just a couple of weeks ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they were like,</v>

978
00:40:20.631 --> 00:40:21.980
<v Speaker 3>what are you going to go do now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

979
00:40:21.981 --> 00:40:24.110
<v Speaker 3>this isn't a Disneyland.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was going on his fingerboard and he</v>

980
00:40:24.111 --> 00:40:26.120
<v Speaker 3>was going to go train and do like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

981
00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:31.150
<v Speaker 3>fingerboard workout that afternoon</v>
<v Speaker 3>because climbing El cap for four hours</v>

982
00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:35.550
<v Speaker 3>was not enough workout for the day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was like</v>

983
00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:37.760
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says what?</v>

984
00:40:37.761 --> 00:40:39.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm in an MRI and showed them images and</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

985
00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:44.200
<v Speaker 1>that's what was his response was it</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain is brains fear levels.</v>

986
00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:46.360
<v Speaker 1>After looking at gruesome and a rousing</v>
<v Speaker 1>images,</v>

987
00:40:46.361 --> 00:40:49.360
<v Speaker 1>he commented,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like whatever that is.</v>

988
00:40:49.361 --> 00:40:51.190
<v Speaker 1>That dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's so mellow.</v>

989
00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:52.053
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's what,</v>

990
00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:54.010
<v Speaker 1>how he described it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I said to him,</v>

991
00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:55.450
<v Speaker 1>I said like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it like?</v>

992
00:40:55.690 --> 00:40:57.160
<v Speaker 1>Are you freaking out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to keep calm.</v>

993
00:40:57.161 --> 00:40:59.230
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're really mellow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

994
00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:01.150
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if anything is like,</v>

995
00:41:01.151 --> 00:41:03.160
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's anything wrong,</v>

996
00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:06.340
<v Speaker 1>it's so wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when it goes wrong,</v>

997
00:41:07.410 --> 00:41:09.760
<v Speaker 1>like you're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like so you're always,</v>

998
00:41:10.170 --> 00:41:12.460
<v Speaker 1>he's his way of putting it was mellow.</v>

999
00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:14.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're really mellow video I believe,</v>

1000
00:41:14.571 --> 00:41:16.490
<v Speaker 3>and it may be Alex and maybe some</v>
<v Speaker 3>another other climate,</v>

1001
00:41:16.491 --> 00:41:20.030
<v Speaker 3>but thinks is a video of him probably</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll cap when he was three solon</v>

1002
00:41:20.090 --> 00:41:22.220
<v Speaker 3>before this one where he says gimme a</v>
<v Speaker 3>minute.</v>

1003
00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:26.150
<v Speaker 3>It was northwest direct face of half</v>
<v Speaker 3>dome and I've climbed that route too.</v>

1004
00:41:26.151 --> 00:41:28.340
<v Speaker 3>And I'll tell you I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only time I've ever seen him flat,</v>

1005
00:41:28.370 --> 00:41:31.420
<v Speaker 3>that was the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was the iconic image on Nat Geo on</v>

1006
00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:35.540
<v Speaker 3>National Geographic magazine of him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just in his plaid shorts shirt,</v>

1007
00:41:35.570 --> 00:41:37.190
<v Speaker 3>like on the ledge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1008
00:41:37.191 --> 00:41:39.020
<v Speaker 3>leaning back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was,</v>

1009
00:41:39.050 --> 00:41:41.270
<v Speaker 3>he reflected on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They asked him about it later and they</v>

1010
00:41:41.271 --> 00:41:42.740
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what was going on?</v>

1011
00:41:42.741 --> 00:41:44.060
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just needed a minute.</v>

1012
00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:46.790
<v Speaker 3>And he got it and he calmed himself</v>
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>

1013
00:41:46.791 --> 00:41:48.650
<v Speaker 3>Whatever was happening in his head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who knows?</v>

1014
00:41:48.651 --> 00:41:51.750
<v Speaker 3>And he recalibrated and went up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1015
00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:52.430
<v Speaker 3>no gear.</v>

1016
00:41:52.430 --> 00:41:54.200
<v Speaker 3>So it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who knows?</v>

1017
00:41:54.201 --> 00:41:55.820
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a right there.</v>

1018
00:41:55.821 --> 00:41:57.240
<v Speaker 3>That's when he needed a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1019
00:41:57.241 --> 00:41:57.760
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1020
00:41:57.760 --> 00:41:59.870
<v Speaker 3>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's another one of Jamie.</v>

1021
00:41:59.871 --> 00:42:00.621
<v Speaker 3>It's it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1022
00:42:00.621 --> 00:42:01.700
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's in that green.</v>

1023
00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:03.980
<v Speaker 3>There he is over there on the right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1024
00:42:04.010 --> 00:42:06.410
<v Speaker 3>That one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the green or the gre or the right</v>

1025
00:42:06.411 --> 00:42:08.380
<v Speaker 3>above it right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's uh,</v>

1026
00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:10.280
<v Speaker 3>the one where you stand in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was sort of on the left.</v>

1027
00:42:10.310 --> 00:42:10.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

1028
00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:14.150
<v Speaker 3>that's the one that I think was the nat</v>
<v Speaker 3>Geo and that's the one he says,</v>

1029
00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:16.190
<v Speaker 3>I just need a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just need a minute.</v>

1030
00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:19.160
<v Speaker 3>That's um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a thousand feet off that debt.</v>

1031
00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:20.193
<v Speaker 4>Hmm.</v>

1032
00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:23.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1033
00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:25.690
<v Speaker 3>imagine if that's your kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We all,</v>

1034
00:42:26.350 --> 00:42:26.951
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're like,</v>

1035
00:42:26.951 --> 00:42:30.730
<v Speaker 3>what are you doing today honey?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So apparently he has a very,</v>

1036
00:42:30.731 --> 00:42:34.220
<v Speaker 3>very close relationship with his momma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He grew up in Sacramento I guess.</v>

1037
00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:39.280
<v Speaker 3>And I'm guessing he just tells his momma</v>
<v Speaker 3>what she needs to know until after it's</v>

1038
00:42:39.511 --> 00:42:40.570
<v Speaker 3>over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1039
00:42:40.930 --> 00:42:43.760
<v Speaker 3>Fucking Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just like that is a,</v>

1040
00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:47.350
<v Speaker 3>that's a crazy thing to be awesome at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1041
00:42:47.430 --> 00:42:48.370
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

1042
00:42:48.371 --> 00:42:48.730
<v Speaker 3>hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wait.</v>

1043
00:42:48.730 --> 00:42:51.100
<v Speaker 3>So we're talking a lot about Columbia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there other reason why I want to</v>

1044
00:42:51.101 --> 00:42:53.110
<v Speaker 3>bring Jeff here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not changing subjects.</v>

1045
00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:55.450
<v Speaker 3>I don't know where the fuck you think</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going.</v>

1046
00:42:55.930 --> 00:42:57.640
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy like,</v>

1047
00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:01.930
<v Speaker 3>so you said that there are a few people</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are trying to emulate what he's</v>

1048
00:43:01.931 --> 00:43:03.190
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1049
00:43:03.220 --> 00:43:06.490
<v Speaker 3>I think there's just a few guys doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>their own thing and it happens to be</v>

1050
00:43:06.491 --> 00:43:09.250
<v Speaker 3>free soloing and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

1051
00:43:09.251 --> 00:43:12.100
<v Speaker 3>he's the pioneer and there were other</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys before him.</v>

1052
00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:15.220
<v Speaker 3>There was a guy named Peter Croft.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was out there for many years,</v>

1053
00:43:15.221 --> 00:43:15.791
<v Speaker 3>sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1054
00:43:15.791 --> 00:43:18.730
<v Speaker 3>he did a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he did a route called astro man in the</v>

1055
00:43:18.731 --> 00:43:20.560
<v Speaker 3>valley.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was at the time.</v>

1056
00:43:20.561 --> 00:43:23.710
<v Speaker 3>And I remember I was in my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think my early twenties when,</v>

1057
00:43:23.830 --> 00:43:27.160
<v Speaker 3>when Peter did that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I remember reading about it and</v>

1058
00:43:27.161 --> 00:43:28.960
<v Speaker 3>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1059
00:43:28.990 --> 00:43:30.910
<v Speaker 3>like what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how,</v>

1060
00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:34.750
<v Speaker 3>how does one want to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was just really getting into</v>

1061
00:43:34.751 --> 00:43:37.120
<v Speaker 3>climbing a lot and I just couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it didn't compute.</v>

1062
00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:42.540
<v Speaker 3>But Peter Croft I think and guys like</v>
<v Speaker 3>him and like Alex just have a wiring</v>

1063
00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:45.430
<v Speaker 3>that's very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very different than the rest of us.</v>

1064
00:43:45.431 --> 00:43:48.100
<v Speaker 3>And it seems reckless to many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many people.</v>

1065
00:43:48.250 --> 00:43:50.320
<v Speaker 3>But what I do seems reckless to many</v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

1066
00:43:50.321 --> 00:43:53.050
<v Speaker 3>So it's so relative and there's a scale,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1067
00:43:53.051 --> 00:43:55.300
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and people that would look at Alex and</v>

1068
00:43:55.301 --> 00:43:56.410
<v Speaker 3>be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're crazy man,</v>

1069
00:43:56.411 --> 00:43:57.250
<v Speaker 3>that shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get to it.</v>

1070
00:43:57.250 --> 00:43:58.690
<v Speaker 3>And like he's like whatever man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure.</v>

1071
00:43:58.691 --> 00:43:59.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is a scale.</v>

1072
00:43:59.811 --> 00:44:01.690
<v Speaker 3>There's a scale.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1073
00:44:01.810 --> 00:44:06.400
<v Speaker 3>Well what about physically?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like is there like an optimum building?</v>

1074
00:44:06.450 --> 00:44:08.530
<v Speaker 3>Like for basketball you really want to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be tall and thin,</v>

1075
00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:09.520
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there,</v>

1076
00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:12.160
<v Speaker 3>is there an optimum billed for what he</v>
<v Speaker 3>does?</v>

1077
00:44:12.190 --> 00:44:12.910
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

1078
00:44:12.910 --> 00:44:17.060
<v Speaker 3>you know sinewy and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the strength to weight ratio is,</v>

1079
00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:18.090
<v Speaker 3>is obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1080
00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:22.290
<v Speaker 3>the best climbers are usually thin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty thin and you know,</v>

1081
00:44:22.350 --> 00:44:25.030
<v Speaker 3>every themselves well and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1082
00:44:25.130 --> 00:44:26.950
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got big hands,</v>

1083
00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:29.950
<v Speaker 3>like not necessarily big like basketball</v>
<v Speaker 3>player,</v>

1084
00:44:29.951 --> 00:44:34.860
<v Speaker 3>but like his fingers sausages is these</v>
<v Speaker 3>fat fingers from constantly training</v>

1085
00:44:34.861 --> 00:44:36.810
<v Speaker 3>them and almost calloused.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1086
00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:39.630
<v Speaker 3>Well the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just the amount of weight that he can</v>

1087
00:44:39.660 --> 00:44:42.910
<v Speaker 3>carry on his hands,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's gotta be pretty unusual.</v>

1088
00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:43.531
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>

1089
00:44:43.531 --> 00:44:46.620
<v Speaker 3>so this finger thing that he does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what is the thing that he did?</v>

1090
00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:49.710
<v Speaker 3>The campus board or a finger or one of</v>
<v Speaker 3>those peg boards,</v>

1091
00:44:49.711 --> 00:44:51.870
<v Speaker 3>like for wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's kind of like a campus board is</v>

1092
00:44:51.871 --> 00:44:55.560
<v Speaker 3>like an inverted sorta board that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>climb up just for strength and it works</v>

1093
00:44:55.561 --> 00:44:58.290
<v Speaker 3>your core and your arms and your chest</v>
<v Speaker 3>and your delts and stuff.</v>

1094
00:44:58.291 --> 00:45:01.110
<v Speaker 3>But then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then the fingerboard allows you to get,</v>

1095
00:45:01.140 --> 00:45:03.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mano Doit doubled Deloitte,</v>

1096
00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:06.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two finger strength so he can then slot</v>

1097
00:45:07.350 --> 00:45:10.770
<v Speaker 3>and then pull on one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So strengthens all your tendons in your,</v>

1098
00:45:10.890 --> 00:45:12.990
<v Speaker 3>in your hands and your fingers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Particularly.</v>

1099
00:45:13.390 --> 00:45:15.990
<v Speaker 3>I'm just a little holes carved out of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1100
00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:17.970
<v Speaker 3>sometimes it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

1101
00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:19.200
<v Speaker 3>that's her right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1102
00:45:19.230 --> 00:45:22.470
<v Speaker 3>So sometimes it's more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes it's a composite.</v>

1103
00:45:22.630 --> 00:45:24.330
<v Speaker 3>It's like almost like a little cubby</v>
<v Speaker 3>shelf.</v>

1104
00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:26.970
<v Speaker 3>And so you stick your hands in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1105
00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:30.090
<v Speaker 3>And then there's routines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used these two finger pockets and</v>

1106
00:45:30.091 --> 00:45:30.924
<v Speaker 3>three finger puck.</v>

1107
00:45:30.930 --> 00:45:32.410
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You use one too?</v>

1108
00:45:32.450 --> 00:45:33.450
<v Speaker 3>And I do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1110
00:45:34.171 --> 00:45:35.640

<v Speaker 3>And then I'll try and hang,</v>

1111
00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:37.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then count the 30,</v>

1112
00:45:37.470 --> 00:45:42.210
<v Speaker 3>hang and then go to finger and hang.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he did this after he summited.</v>

1113
00:45:42.630 --> 00:45:44.970
<v Speaker 3>So we went down and was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>got to interview and he goes,</v>

<v Speaker 3>it's that extreme connection to nature,</v>

1155
00:47:15.451 --> 00:47:17.130
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And to life.</v>

1156
00:47:17.131 --> 00:47:19.380
<v Speaker 3>And like you were talking about it a</v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit ago before we came on air.</v>

1157
00:47:19.381 --> 00:47:20.214
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1158
00:47:20.250 --> 00:47:21.120
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1159
00:47:21.121 --> 00:47:23.910
<v Speaker 3>when you're stoned,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see the ball track better when</v>

1160
00:47:23.911 --> 00:47:25.350
<v Speaker 3>you're playing pool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1161
00:47:25.380 --> 00:47:27.180
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You feel like the revolutions of the</v>

1162
00:47:27.181 --> 00:47:29.140
<v Speaker 3>ball,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you feel like how well you could</v>

1163
00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:30.070
<v Speaker 3>touch the ball</v>

1164
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:32.650
<v Speaker 1>and get it to move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you're too bulky for me at least.</v>

1165
00:47:32.810 --> 00:47:33.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1166
00:47:33.620 --> 00:47:35.710
<v Speaker 1>I feel I play like 10% better when I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>high.</v>

1167
00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:37.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For whatever reason.</v>

1168
00:47:37.710 --> 00:47:39.730
<v Speaker 1>Just feel more in touch with things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1169
00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:42.940
<v Speaker 1>That's why I like the social sliver.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Social Sliver.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Nah.</v>

1179

<v Speaker 1>Siliciden so they take mushrooms and</v>

1180
00:48:05.211 --> 00:48:06.340
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1181
00:48:06.370 --> 00:48:08.470
<v Speaker 1>distill it down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>concentrated up,</v>

1182
00:48:08.471 --> 00:48:12.820
<v Speaker 1>get this liquid turnitin in and do a</v>
<v Speaker 1>tootsie roll appearing,</v>

1183
00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:17.020
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>consistency color.</v>

1184
00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:19.120
<v Speaker 1>Give it an a halloween,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get a stick.</v>

1185
00:48:19.150 --> 00:48:21.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you get a stick and it's literally</v>

1186
00:48:21.551 --> 00:48:23.740
<v Speaker 1>the size of a tootsie roll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we just took like a little,</v>

1187
00:48:23.741 --> 00:48:27.300
<v Speaker 1>just a little nip and that's the social</v>
<v Speaker 1>sliver and like,</v>

1188
00:48:27.350 --> 00:48:29.200
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it makes you just a little more</v>

1189
00:48:29.201 --> 00:48:29.810
<v Speaker 1>tuned in.</v>

1190
00:48:29.810 --> 00:48:31.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot more tuned in.</v>

1191
00:48:31.270 --> 00:48:34.000
<v Speaker 1>I have a buddy who's a high level</v>
<v Speaker 1>kickboxer world champion.</v>

1192
00:48:34.001 --> 00:48:36.640
<v Speaker 1>Kickboxer started microdosing few months</v>
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>

1193
00:48:36.641 --> 00:48:39.630
<v Speaker 1>does it hoover every day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>micro doses.</v>

1194
00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:43.120
<v Speaker 1>And he competes on it fucks people up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Always.</v>

1195
00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:46.240
<v Speaker 1>Microdosing so with what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>With el or with now mushrooms.</v>

1196
00:48:46.250 --> 00:48:47.800
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1197
00:48:47.801 --> 00:48:50.290
<v Speaker 1>and you might know more than in the zone</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>

1198
00:48:50.291 --> 00:48:52.150
<v Speaker 1>but if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you take it seriously,</v>

1199
00:48:52.151 --> 00:48:53.140
<v Speaker 1>it starts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you lose,</v>

1200
00:48:53.170 --> 00:48:55.060
<v Speaker 1>it gets diluted over time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1201
00:48:55.061 --> 00:48:56.800
<v Speaker 1>But when he takes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he stops taking it,</v>

1202
00:48:57.160 --> 00:48:59.720
<v Speaker 1>he feels that he misses it does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1203
00:48:59.870 --> 00:49:01.030
<v Speaker 1>Every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a vitamin.</v>

1204
00:49:01.090 --> 00:49:02.920
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's called addiction.</v>

1205
00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:04.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so because not addicted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Addictive.</v>

1206
00:49:04.770 --> 00:49:07.660
<v Speaker 1>But it's like you get addicted to</v>
<v Speaker 1>washing your hands.</v>

1207
00:49:07.690 --> 00:49:10.300
<v Speaker 1>If you're one crazy ocd guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gotta wash your hands one more time.</v>

1208
00:49:10.430 --> 00:49:12.610
<v Speaker 1>Like if you really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get a mental pathway that's very</v>

1209
00:49:12.611 --> 00:49:13.930
<v Speaker 1>destructive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1210
00:49:14.130 --> 00:49:17.080
<v Speaker 1>you can call it addictive but it doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>demonize washing your hands.</v>

1211
00:49:17.300 --> 00:49:19.690
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think his issue is uh,</v>

1212
00:49:20.050 --> 00:49:21.700
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he doesn't take it,</v>

1213
00:49:21.701 --> 00:49:23.750
<v Speaker 1>he says it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things aren't as fun.</v>

1214
00:49:23.751 --> 00:49:26.650
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't feel as good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I've been around him when he's</v>

1215
00:49:26.651 --> 00:49:28.780
<v Speaker 1>taking it and he's 100%,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

1216
00:49:28.850 --> 00:49:29.681
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

1217
00:49:29.681 --> 00:49:30.790
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow man,</v>

1218
00:49:31.090 --> 00:49:33.910

<v Speaker 1>thinking you're eyes are looking at me</v>

1234
00:50:11.830 --> 00:50:12.760
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's talk later about,</v>

1235
00:50:12.790 --> 00:50:15.430
<v Speaker 1>I know there's people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1236
00:50:15.700 --> 00:50:17.920
<v Speaker 1>there's conversations that need to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to happen.</v>

1237
00:50:17.921 --> 00:50:20.860
<v Speaker 1>The absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So are a lot of these climbers doing</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

1239
00:50:21.730 --> 00:50:23.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1240
00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:24.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

1243
00:50:28.371 --> 00:50:30.770
<v Speaker 1>like to mess around with those things</v>
<v Speaker 1>all together.</v>

1244
00:50:30.771 --> 00:50:33.070
<v Speaker 1>And not to say that I don't like to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>trip my balls off and go get on a rock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course right now,</v>

1246
00:50:36.651 --> 00:50:39.800
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had a few sort of spooky times just</v>

1247
00:50:39.801 --> 00:50:44.450
<v Speaker 1>being really stoned and being on a rock</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not liking the situation I was in.</v>

1248
00:50:44.570 --> 00:50:45.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1249
00:50:45.710 --> 00:50:48.830
<v Speaker 1>I've been that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just normal life.</v>

1250
00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:51.350
<v Speaker 1>Like you get too stoned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially like edibles.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Uh Oh fuck you.</v>

00:50:55.431 --> 00:50:57.710
<v Speaker 1>I had a bit off my last special.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's based on the truth.</v>

1254
00:50:57.750 --> 00:51:02.750
<v Speaker 1>I hate a fucking gummy bear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a pot gummy bear and a this the guy told</v>

<v Speaker 1>me to just eat the leg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really is a true thing.</v>

1256
00:51:05.241 --> 00:51:06.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why the fuck are you making a whole</v>

1257
00:51:06.771 --> 00:51:08.530
<v Speaker 1>bear?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then if he wants him to eat a leg,</v>

1258

<v Speaker 1>it's this tiny little thing and I hate</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole bear and oh my God.</v>

1259
00:51:12.830 --> 00:51:15.750
<v Speaker 1>For the fridge for a while too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's long time till it's metabolized</v>

1260

<v Speaker 1>rights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours,</v>

00:51:17.420 --> 00:51:19.940
<v Speaker 1>hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you feel so good when it's over.</v>

1262
00:51:19.941 --> 00:51:23.360
<v Speaker 1>You feel like I needed that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I needed all that pain and fear and just</v>

1263
00:51:23.361 --> 00:51:25.940
<v Speaker 1>say I got through it and it's like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>near death experience,</v>

00:51:26.440 --> 00:51:29.840
<v Speaker 1>you know like something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something about it like it's cleansing.</v>

1265
00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:33.980
<v Speaker 1>Eating a gummy bear should have that</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of a shouldn't but it does and when</v>

1266
00:51:33.981 --> 00:51:37.550
<v Speaker 1>it comes through on the other side like</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's beneficial as long as you could</v>

<v Speaker 1>keep it together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know as a person who's,</v>

<v Speaker 1>that's why bums me out that you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>smoke pot or do anything cause I know</v>

1269
00:51:43.671 --> 00:51:45.950
<v Speaker 1>you could keep it together because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a tough guy.</v>

1270
00:51:45.951 --> 00:51:47.930
<v Speaker 1>You keep life together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you would just,</v>

1271
00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:50.720
<v Speaker 1>it would just make you more aware of but</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's my,</v>

1272
00:51:50.780 --> 00:51:53.290
<v Speaker 1>here's my teen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Years ago we started this company to</v>

1273
00:51:53.380 --> 00:51:55.940
<v Speaker 1>take on you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bud is a on the death bed.</v>

1274
00:51:55.941 --> 00:51:58.940

<v Speaker 1>Hi Bud likes to be in control.</v>

1275
00:51:59.000 --> 00:51:59.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the problem.</v>

1276
00:52:00.020 --> 00:52:02.840
<v Speaker 1>And he's afraid that he might not be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ever look at the closet?</v>

1277
00:52:02.990 --> 00:52:05.190
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it shock you when everything's</v>

1278
00:52:05.210 --> 00:52:07.470
<v Speaker 1>black?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a little confusing.</v>

1279
00:52:07.471 --> 00:52:10.700
<v Speaker 1>So I had a 10 minute conversation with</v>
<v Speaker 1>this dude last night.</v>

1280
00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:11.990
<v Speaker 1>Like dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of fucked me up.</v>

1281
00:52:11.991 --> 00:52:14.550
<v Speaker 1>Looking at your closet</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1282
00:52:14.570 --> 00:52:16.460
<v Speaker 1>The fuck out of my sight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like other colors.</v>

1283
00:52:16.740 --> 00:52:21.140
<v Speaker 1>Everything's black.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was linear feet of of one shade.</v>

1284
00:52:21.141 --> 00:52:23.240
<v Speaker 1>Variation of the other black shirt of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other books.</v>

1285
00:52:23.960 --> 00:52:26.300
<v Speaker 1>He's a fucking Ninja.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No play makes jack a dull boy.</v>

1286
00:52:26.330 --> 00:52:28.310
<v Speaker 1>All work and no play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Makes Jack a dull boy.</v>

1287
00:52:28.370 --> 00:52:29.780
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1288
00:52:29.781 --> 00:52:30.614
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1289
00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:32.930
<v Speaker 1>It's efficient decision making.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1290
00:52:32.931 --> 00:52:36.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to make that decision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other shit that goes on the left so</v>

1291
00:52:36.021 --> 00:52:39.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to wear that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel that I could feel that.</v>

1292
00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:42.050
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand that guys guys,</v>

1293
00:52:42.051 --> 00:52:44.150
<v Speaker 1>everybody develops a uniform in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1294
00:52:44.180 --> 00:52:45.980
<v Speaker 1>When you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter if it's a khaki shorts</v>

1295
00:52:45.981 --> 00:52:49.970
<v Speaker 1>and a blue everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as you develop it.</v>

1296
00:52:50.230 --> 00:52:53.630
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it was orange it would be a big</v>

1297
00:52:53.631 --> 00:52:55.550
<v Speaker 1>issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you are walking around with orange</v>

1298
00:52:55.551 --> 00:52:57.650
<v Speaker 1>sneakers and orange pants and orange</v>
<v Speaker 1>shirt,</v>

1299
00:52:57.651 --> 00:53:00.230
<v Speaker 1>like this wacky motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but somehow or another because it's</v>

1300
00:53:00.231 --> 00:53:02.210
<v Speaker 1>black and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh it's bud friend of mine,</v>

1303
00:53:08.751 --> 00:53:09.171
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1307
00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:24.750

<v Speaker 1>It's probably so confusing.</v>

00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:27.720
<v Speaker 1>Everybody remembers me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My green pants.</v>

1309

1316
00:53:44.881 --> 00:53:47.100
<v Speaker 1>some crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't even think it was really</v>

1317
00:53:47.101 --> 00:53:49.170
<v Speaker 1>a mormon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think it was just a con man who</v>

1318
00:53:49.171 --> 00:53:52.770
<v Speaker 1>used being a mormon to lock people up.</v>

<v Speaker 1>just like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>There's quite a few.</v>

1322
00:53:58.440 --> 00:54:00.510
<v Speaker 1>Especially with Mormons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's very,</v>

1323
00:54:00.630 --> 00:54:02.070
<v Speaker 1>very interesting religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1324
00:54:02.220 --> 00:54:04.080
<v Speaker 1>When you know the guy who made the</v>
<v Speaker 1>religion,</v>

1325
00:54:04.110 --> 00:54:06.360

<v Speaker 1>pretty prominent.</v>

<v Speaker 1>and then Joseph Smith.</v>

<v Speaker 1>golden tablets.</v>

1330
00:54:17.041 --> 00:54:20.160
<v Speaker 1>They contain the loss work of Jesus and</v>
<v Speaker 1>only he could read them cause he had a</v>

1331
00:54:20.161 --> 00:54:24.090
<v Speaker 1>magic seer stone had a stone that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>could look through is to read these</v>

1332
00:54:24.630 --> 00:54:27.870
<v Speaker 1>fucking Christ broke out of jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He jumped out of the window and was</v>

<v Speaker 1>I think what the,</v>

1336
00:54:31.421 --> 00:54:32.940
<v Speaker 1>the funny thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it didn't,</v>

1337
00:54:32.970 --> 00:54:35.130
<v Speaker 1>if it was him or somebody else who</v>
<v Speaker 1>invented the polygamy part,</v>

1338
00:54:35.140 --> 00:54:35.910
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

1339
00:54:35.910 --> 00:54:38.910
<v Speaker 1>I got another tablet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can fuck all the bitches I want.</v>

1340
00:54:38.911 --> 00:54:41.400
<v Speaker 1>Hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every guy that was many wives I want.</v>

1341
00:54:41.730 --> 00:54:42.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's uh,</v>

1342
00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:44.610
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good luck with all that.</v>

1343
00:54:44.700 --> 00:54:45.533
<v Speaker 1>That never works.</v>

1344
00:54:45.570 --> 00:54:46.560
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1345
00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:49.100
<v Speaker 1>why would you want more than one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I can't handle one.</v>

1346
00:54:49.930 --> 00:54:53.340
<v Speaker 1>Some people just like danger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Alex honnold likes to solo climb,</v>

1347
00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:57.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's just people like chicks</v>

1348
00:54:57.271 --> 00:54:58.890
<v Speaker 1>yelling at them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>It sounds like it,</v>

1350
00:55:00.181 --> 00:55:02.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm not here to judge overload.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it should be legal.</v>

1351
00:55:02.911 --> 00:55:04.770
<v Speaker 1>I think if those 19 women are into it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're into it,</v>

1352
00:55:05.070 --> 00:55:06.630
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is it even legal to get married at</v>

1353
00:55:06.631 --> 00:55:09.630
<v Speaker 1>all?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is it when you see 50% divorce and</v>

1354
00:55:09.631 --> 00:55:11.430
<v Speaker 1>people get their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their lives devastated,</v>

1355
00:55:11.431 --> 00:55:12.960
<v Speaker 1>when does the government step in and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

<v Speaker 1>This is just ruining all these people.</v>

1357
00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:19.530
<v Speaker 1>Like the kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it ruins more people than ne thing.</v>

1358
00:55:19.870 --> 00:55:22.340
<v Speaker 1>It just stop getting married.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keeps the loggers afloat.</v>

1359

<v Speaker 1>we can't stop that won't make any money.</v>

1363

<v Speaker 1>sold it to the Dole company who used to</v>

1366
00:55:38.911 --> 00:55:42.330

<v Speaker 1>plantation and that was what it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>forever.</v>

1368
00:55:45.420 --> 00:55:46.720
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

<v Speaker 1>That dude bought it and then he sold it</v>

1372
00:55:55.291 --> 00:55:59.640
<v Speaker 1>to Larry Ellison who just runs around</v>
<v Speaker 1>and gold underwear and fucking ass</v>

<v Speaker 1>but he just wanted to own it.</v>

1377
00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:10.110
<v Speaker 1>It's a fucking baller place to live</v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

1378
00:56:10.390 --> 00:56:12.930

<v Speaker 1>the concentration of people,</v>

1381
00:56:21.931 --> 00:56:24.580
<v Speaker 1>it's not necessarily on a coastline</v>
<v Speaker 1>nights in the middle,</v>

1382
00:56:24.850 --> 00:56:25.770
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in the middle.</v>

1383
00:56:25.771 --> 00:56:27.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Smart people don't live on the coast.</v>

1384
00:56:27.050 --> 00:56:28.600
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

1385
00:56:28.601 --> 00:56:30.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this island's not that big.</v>

1386
00:56:30.581 --> 00:56:32.870
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes shit goes bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1387
00:56:32.940 --> 00:56:36.100
<v Speaker 1>it's not pr where the water has got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could go to the fucking water.</v>

1388
00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:38.370
<v Speaker 1>It's right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the asshole American like,</v>

1389
00:56:38.410 --> 00:56:39.670
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to live there.</v>

1390
00:56:39.730 --> 00:56:41.950
<v Speaker 1>Anywhere you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can take a hike to the water.</v>

1391
00:56:42.520 --> 00:56:44.260
<v Speaker 1>It'll take a few hours if you're in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>middle,</v>

1392
00:56:44.300 --> 00:56:46.870
<v Speaker 1>but get there like you don't have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>live there.</v>

1393
00:56:47.050 --> 00:56:49.720
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So tell me about the access to,</v>

1394
00:56:49.750 --> 00:56:51.520
<v Speaker 1>I want to hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're everywhere.</v>

1395
00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:53.240
<v Speaker 1>Not even sporting or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1396
00:56:53.241 --> 00:56:54.910
<v Speaker 1>it was definitely sporting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause these animals,</v>

1397
00:56:54.940 --> 00:56:59.920
<v Speaker 1>they evolve to run from tigers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are the fastest fucking animals I</v>

1398
00:56:59.921 --> 00:57:01.390
<v Speaker 1>have ever seen in my life.</v>

1399
00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:03.760
<v Speaker 1>Like in terms of like their ability to</v>
<v Speaker 1>react.</v>

1400
00:57:03.940 --> 00:57:06.490
<v Speaker 1>Like there would be a deer 60 yards</v>
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

1401
00:57:06.491 --> 00:57:10.750
<v Speaker 1>You draw back on it and launched the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arrow and it would be nowhere near that</v>

1402
00:57:10.751 --> 00:57:13.750
<v Speaker 1>Arrow by the time the Arrow got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you lost a few sharp sticks while</v>

1403
00:57:13.751 --> 00:57:16.240
<v Speaker 1>you're there while you go five lighted</v>
<v Speaker 1>nocks.</v>

1404
00:57:16.241 --> 00:57:17.590
<v Speaker 1>I can see them in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the grass,</v>

1405
00:57:17.591 --> 00:57:22.591
<v Speaker 1>but I lost two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the arrows are going 275 feet a</v>

1406
00:57:23.711 --> 00:57:25.640
<v Speaker 1>second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the deers like</v>

1407
00:57:27.480 --> 00:57:32.480
<v Speaker 1>chance to the island because there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no indigenous mammos on that</v>

1408
00:57:32.921 --> 00:57:35.440
<v Speaker 1>island.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything is invasive and everything</v>

1409
00:57:35.441 --> 00:57:39.160
<v Speaker 1>has no predators.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they bring in these rangers and seals</v>

1410
00:57:39.161 --> 00:57:40.950
<v Speaker 1>the snipers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They bring them in,</v>

1411
00:57:40.990 --> 00:57:43.900
<v Speaker 1>they set up on a bench and they just</v>
<v Speaker 1>start pumping.</v>

1412
00:57:44.140 --> 00:57:46.100
<v Speaker 1>But Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they started taking them out and they</v>

1413
00:57:46.140 --> 00:57:47.380
<v Speaker 1>have decal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1414
00:57:47.410 --> 00:57:49.060
<v Speaker 1>well no they don't have to use a 50 cow.</v>

1415
00:57:49.060 --> 00:57:51.250
<v Speaker 1>We'd probably use like [inaudible] or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

1416
00:57:51.251 --> 00:57:54.250
<v Speaker 1>But why do that when you want the meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the meat is outstanding.</v>

1417
00:57:54.540 --> 00:57:56.320
<v Speaker 1>It is some of the most delicious meat in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

1418
00:57:56.440 --> 00:58:00.970
<v Speaker 1>But these animals are so on point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for bow hunters it was like one of</v>

1419
00:58:00.971 --> 00:58:05.440
<v Speaker 1>the best places for spot and stalk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you could put the smack down on</v>

1420
00:58:05.441 --> 00:58:08.530
<v Speaker 1>an axis deer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you either got lucky,</v>

1421
00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:11.640
<v Speaker 1>which is me or you got some skill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1422
00:58:11.641 --> 00:58:15.040
<v Speaker 1>like I've got a little bit of skill but</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guys that I went with it are really</v>

1423
00:58:15.041 --> 00:58:16.060
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Remy Warren,</v>

1424
00:58:16.061 --> 00:58:17.980
<v Speaker 1>I think he shot three or four while I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was there.</v>

1425
00:58:17.981 --> 00:58:21.190
<v Speaker 1>My friend John Dudley shot for</v>
<v Speaker 1>worldclass bow hunters.</v>

1426
00:58:21.191 --> 00:58:24.460
<v Speaker 1>Like as good as it gets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those guys killed quite a few.</v>

1427
00:58:24.461 --> 00:58:25.580
<v Speaker 1>But it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got,</v>

1428
00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:29.560
<v Speaker 1>it's a great learning ground like for</v>
<v Speaker 1>stalking cause you,</v>

1429
00:58:29.561 --> 00:58:31.890
<v Speaker 1>you blow so many stocks getting it.</v>

1430
00:58:31.900 --> 00:58:33.750
<v Speaker 1>How long do you smell you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1431
00:58:34.060 --> 00:58:38.210
<v Speaker 1>I only hunted for three days because a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a problem with my bow that I had a</v>

1432
00:58:38.211 --> 00:58:40.600
<v Speaker 1>fixed once I got there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it took a day to do that.</v>

1433
00:58:40.601 --> 00:58:44.200
<v Speaker 1>But once you get there and you see how</v>
<v Speaker 1>many deer,</v>

1434
00:58:44.350 --> 00:58:45.790
<v Speaker 1>you realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1435
00:58:45.791 --> 00:58:48.160
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is like this place is overpopulate</v>

1436
00:58:48.161 --> 00:58:50.140
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in those three days,</v>

1437
00:58:50.310 --> 00:58:51.460
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw thousands.</v>

1438
00:58:51.461 --> 00:58:52.930
<v Speaker 1>You saw shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thousands,</v>

1439
00:58:53.140 --> 00:58:54.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean thousands and you took a few</v>
<v Speaker 1>shots.</v>

1440
00:58:54.971 --> 00:58:56.680
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took a free shots.</v>

1441
00:58:56.760 --> 00:58:59.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're tough animals too.</v>

1442
00:58:59.080 --> 00:59:00.580
<v Speaker 1>So are you moving?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you literally,</v>

1443
00:59:00.610 --> 00:59:03.010
<v Speaker 1>are you moving in stock and then pause</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and holding?</v>

1444
00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:04.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing what you call steel</v>

1445
00:59:04.670 --> 00:59:06.550
<v Speaker 1>hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>walking.</v>

1446
00:59:06.551 --> 00:59:08.430
<v Speaker 1>And then you're looking for an animal</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're,</v>

1447
00:59:08.431 --> 00:59:10.030
<v Speaker 1>you're constantly using your wind</v>
<v Speaker 1>checker,</v>

1448
00:59:10.031 --> 00:59:13.920
<v Speaker 1>which is like a wising bottle with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>talcum shower.</v>

1449
00:59:13.921 --> 00:59:16.390
<v Speaker 1>And you bought $100 a while just</v>
<v Speaker 1>recently started.</v>

1450
00:59:16.390 --> 00:59:19.570
<v Speaker 1>So you puff that in the air and you find</v>
<v Speaker 1>out which way the wind is going.</v>

1451
00:59:19.750 --> 00:59:23.270
<v Speaker 1>My guide though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he knew where the wind was going.</v>

1452
00:59:23.360 --> 00:59:25.940
<v Speaker 1>He just knew from his face and his neck</v>
<v Speaker 1>and his skin.</v>

1453
00:59:25.941 --> 00:59:28.070
<v Speaker 1>Like he can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course the wind blowing and he's</v>

1454
00:59:28.071 --> 00:59:29.360
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this.</v>

1455
00:59:29.570 --> 00:59:32.450
<v Speaker 1>And he just puffed that smoke in there</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sure enough it was going exactly</v>

1456
00:59:32.451 --> 00:59:34.520
<v Speaker 1>where it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shout out to roll man.</v>

1457
00:59:35.810 --> 00:59:36.890
<v Speaker 1>But his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1458
00:59:36.950 --> 00:59:40.130
<v Speaker 1>his ability to sneak up on these animals</v>
<v Speaker 1>is pretty fucking impressive to,</v>

1459
00:59:40.280 --> 00:59:41.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do a lot of crawling,</v>

1460
00:59:42.150 --> 00:59:43.940
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of the grasses like waist</v>
<v Speaker 1>high,</v>

1461
00:59:43.941 --> 00:59:47.510
<v Speaker 1>so you're doing like crawling where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're moving like literally like a</v>

1462
00:59:47.511 --> 00:59:50.690
<v Speaker 1>snail's pace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Try not to make too much noise cause you</v>

1463
00:59:50.691 --> 00:59:53.030
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're over there and I'm already</v>

1464
00:59:53.031 --> 00:59:56.930
<v Speaker 1>reading glass and you're on an island so</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't really go that far.</v>

1465
00:59:56.950 --> 00:59:58.970
<v Speaker 1>They're fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's plenty of room for them to go.</v>

1466
00:59:59.210 --> 01:00:01.610
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is not like you're hunting</v>

1467
01:00:01.611 --> 01:00:04.610
<v Speaker 1>them in a 100 acre confined high fence</v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

1468
01:00:04.611 --> 01:00:08.690
<v Speaker 1>It's all wild and free range and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's mountain terrain and there's</v>

1469
01:00:08.691 --> 01:00:10.240
<v Speaker 1>plenty of places for them to get away</v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

1470
01:00:10.430 --> 01:00:13.010
<v Speaker 1>but they're aware of one Predator</v>
<v Speaker 1>humans,</v>

1471
01:00:13.370 --> 01:00:14.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now that they're not scared of</v>

1472
01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:17.150
<v Speaker 1>anything other than people when they see</v>
<v Speaker 1>a person like,</v>

1473
01:00:17.151 --> 01:00:19.910
<v Speaker 1>fuck this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but are there a lot of bow hunters that</v>

1474
01:00:19.911 --> 01:00:21.950
<v Speaker 1>go over there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's plenty of bowhunters ago over</v>

1475
01:00:21.951 --> 01:00:22.784
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1476
01:00:22.850 --> 01:00:23.720
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1477
01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:25.700
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a pretty amazing place,</v>

1478
01:00:25.701 --> 01:00:27.590
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Maui is another really great place</v>

1479
01:00:27.591 --> 01:00:28.670
<v Speaker 1>for bow hunting too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently.</v>

1480
01:00:28.671 --> 01:00:32.240
<v Speaker 1>And Molly also has pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maui has a axis deer.</v>

1481
01:00:32.250 --> 01:00:34.700
<v Speaker 1>They have a deer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a ram called a move.</v>

1482
01:00:34.701 --> 01:00:37.400
<v Speaker 1>Flon that apparently is unbelievably</v>
<v Speaker 1>delicious,</v>

1483
01:00:37.401 --> 01:00:38.930
<v Speaker 1>but the locals think it tastes like</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

1484
01:00:39.110 --> 01:00:42.590
<v Speaker 1>Some local set of tastes like shit and</v>
<v Speaker 1>some local sets the most delicious meat</v>

<v Speaker 1>Elk is my favorite meat,</v>

1492
01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:05.570

<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to relate those with</v>

1498
01:01:14.181 --> 01:01:15.860
<v Speaker 1>it's a really small animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1499
01:01:16.310 --> 01:01:17.000
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1500
01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.590
<v Speaker 1>they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1501
01:01:18.591 --> 01:01:21.260
<v Speaker 1>they're on this really rugged mountain</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrain.</v>

1502
01:01:21.730 --> 01:01:24.920
<v Speaker 1>Lanai is so fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's such a fascinating place.</v>

1503
01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:27.560
<v Speaker 1>And the people that live there could not</v>
<v Speaker 1>be nicer,</v>

1504
01:01:27.830 --> 01:01:29.720
<v Speaker 1>could not be cooler.</v>

1506
01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:35.780
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah it's weird because they've decided</v>

1507
01:01:35.781 --> 01:01:37.640
<v Speaker 1>to introduce these animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they did it.</v>

1508
01:01:37.641 --> 01:01:40.610
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait back hundreds of years ago and they</v>

1509
01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:43.880
<v Speaker 1>have to keep those populations in check</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes again they bring in</v>

1510
01:01:43.881 --> 01:01:48.440
<v Speaker 1>snipers and they put a bench down and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just set up shop and get those long</v>

1511
01:01:48.441 --> 01:01:49.890
<v Speaker 1>range skills.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like that's the place where you actually</v>

1554
01:03:17.761 --> 01:03:20.340
<v Speaker 1>should be hunting these animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1555
01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:22.740
<v Speaker 1>whenever I go to Hawaii,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always just feel like I should show my</v>

1556
01:03:22.741 --> 01:03:23.574
<v Speaker 1>passport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1562
01:03:33.031 --> 01:03:35.310
<v Speaker 1>I liked the fact that you can go there</v>
<v Speaker 1>without a passport,</v>

1563
01:03:35.311 --> 01:03:37.530
<v Speaker 1>but I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm one of those Weirdos that think</v>

1564
01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:39.510
<v Speaker 1>there shouldn't be passports,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should be able to go anywhere.</v>

1565
01:03:39.870 --> 01:03:42.720
<v Speaker 1>It's part of our problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But everybody's all locked into these</v>

1566
01:03:42.721 --> 01:03:45.120
<v Speaker 1>land masses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forbidden areas.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Break those boundaries.</v>

1568
01:03:46.650 --> 01:03:47.490
<v Speaker 1>Tear down that wall.</v>

1569
01:03:48.270 --> 01:03:53.270
<v Speaker 3>I was just in Iraq and you talking about</v>
<v Speaker 3>some boundaries and sort of lines in the</v>

1570
01:03:53.641 --> 01:03:55.530
<v Speaker 3>sand and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boy,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm sure.</v>

1572
01:03:57.030 --> 01:04:00.090
<v Speaker 3>What were you doing over there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I went with,</v>

1573
01:04:00.150 --> 01:04:01.770
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so back up,</v>

1574
01:04:01.870 --> 01:04:03.060
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two years ago,</v>

1575
01:04:03.061 --> 01:04:08.061
<v Speaker 3>the earthquake in Nepal that killed</v>
<v Speaker 3>nine,</v>

1576
01:04:08.101 --> 01:04:10.740
<v Speaker 3>almost 10,000 people throughout the</v>
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>

1577
01:04:11.530 --> 01:04:13.060
<v Speaker 1>19 on the mountain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll never Australia.</v>

1578
01:04:13.090 --> 01:04:16.210
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people got dead and people</v>

1579
01:04:16.211 --> 01:04:17.500
<v Speaker 1>died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that one,</v>

1580
01:04:17.770 --> 01:04:18.670
<v Speaker 1>was it an avalanche?</v>

1581
01:04:19.010 --> 01:04:19.843
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1582
01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:24.290
<v Speaker 3>so the earthquake triggered a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>glaciers that are hanging up around in</v>

1583
01:04:24.291 --> 01:04:28.580
<v Speaker 3>that cirque and it released in a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff just blew through base camp and</v>

1584
01:04:28.581 --> 01:04:30.650
<v Speaker 3>killed folks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But throughout Nepal,</v>

1585
01:04:30.710 --> 01:04:33.800
<v Speaker 3>throughout the countryside,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we're talking villages that have</v>

1586
01:04:33.830 --> 01:04:37.490
<v Speaker 3>stone huts and no motor and no rebar and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1587
01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:40.550
<v Speaker 3>just shakes just a little bit and she</v>
<v Speaker 3>falls down.</v>

1588
01:04:41.380 --> 01:04:43.400
<v Speaker 3>I mean the place was desks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a house of temples.</v>

1589
01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:44.741
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1590
01:04:44.741 --> 01:04:48.500
<v Speaker 3>so lots of devastation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lots of people dead and lots of</v>

1591
01:04:48.501 --> 01:04:50.960
<v Speaker 3>injuries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that day that happened,</v>

1592
01:04:51.890 --> 01:04:54.680
<v Speaker 3>I knew I wanted to go to Nepal to help.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a PA,</v>

1593
01:04:54.681 --> 01:04:57.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm a physician assistant and I've</v>
<v Speaker 3>specialized in emergency medicine.</v>

1594
01:04:57.621 --> 01:05:01.670
<v Speaker 3>So I knew I wanted to be there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And more than anything like focused on</v>

1595
01:05:01.730 --> 01:05:03.950
<v Speaker 3>sort of austere medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1596
01:05:03.951 --> 01:05:07.760
<v Speaker 3>like I want to go out there where Shit's</v>

<v Speaker 3>So not supplied or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>subsidized by the feds.</v>

1601
01:05:23.741 --> 01:05:27.460
<v Speaker 3>This is just like sponsorship.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Basically donation money gets you over</v>

1602
01:05:27.461 --> 01:05:32.140
<v Speaker 3>there and you do your work so you're not</v>
<v Speaker 3>under the auspices of the phets.</v>

1603
01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:35.650
<v Speaker 3>So went over there with these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nyc medics,</v>

1604
01:05:35.651 --> 01:05:40.360
<v Speaker 3>which is a group of former and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>New York City paramedics that realize</v>

1605

<v Speaker 3>dotting Bessie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is right at the base of the</v>

1611
01:05:56.501 --> 01:06:00.070
<v Speaker 3>connection mall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is a place that we landed in</v>

1612
01:06:00.071 --> 01:06:04.000
<v Speaker 3>some helicopters and set up shop and</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a lot of these Nepalis that</v>

1613
01:06:04.510 --> 01:06:06.520
<v Speaker 3>Tamang Nepali there.</v>

1614
01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:08.260
<v Speaker 3>That's their ethnic tribe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not sure,</v>

1615
01:06:08.261 --> 01:06:10.600
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Tamang they see the helicopter come</v>

1616
01:06:10.601 --> 01:06:12.460
<v Speaker 3>in and these white dudes get out of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>helicopter and like,</v>

1617
01:06:12.461 --> 01:06:15.160
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck we need help.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you here to help?</v>

1618
01:06:15.190 --> 01:06:16.030
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're here to help.</v>

1619
01:06:16.210 --> 01:06:19.420
<v Speaker 3>So we had three helicopters worth of</v>
<v Speaker 3>gear downloaded.</v>

1620
01:06:19.421 --> 01:06:21.490
<v Speaker 3>It's set up our clinic and we're there</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a month.</v>

1621
01:06:21.491 --> 01:06:24.010
<v Speaker 3>We saw,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

1622
01:06:24.011 --> 01:06:27.070
<v Speaker 3>seven or 800 patients in the course of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>month.</v>

1623
01:06:27.150 --> 01:06:32.150
<v Speaker 3>And what started as trauma from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>earthquake sort of then segwayed into</v>

1624
01:06:33.730 --> 01:06:38.730
<v Speaker 3>primary care and infections and I mean</v>
<v Speaker 3>injuries and also believe it or not,</v>

1625
01:06:39.371 --> 01:06:44.371
<v Speaker 3>like a lot of of of you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychological pain.</v>

1626
01:06:44.441 --> 01:06:46.870
<v Speaker 3>Like they were scared of the earth was</v>
<v Speaker 3>shaking still.</v>

1627
01:06:47.050 --> 01:06:49.240
<v Speaker 3>I mean there was tremor after tremor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after tremor,</v>

1628
01:06:49.390 --> 01:06:53.440
<v Speaker 3>I mean every day the earth would shake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got home and for a month after I got</v>

1629
01:06:53.441 --> 01:06:55.620
<v Speaker 3>back from there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I still felt the ground shake.</v>

1630
01:06:55.620 --> 01:06:56.560
<v Speaker 3>And in Boulder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Colorado,</v>

1631
01:06:57.100 --> 01:07:00.220
<v Speaker 3>because it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my body was still sort of equilibrium</v>

1632
01:07:00.221 --> 01:07:02.410
<v Speaker 3>was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So tremors every single day.</v>

1633
01:07:02.411 --> 01:07:04.360
<v Speaker 3>So these people needed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1634
01:07:04.361 --> 01:07:05.650
<v Speaker 3>anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 3>medicines,</v>

1635
01:07:05.651 --> 01:07:07.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be able to take the edge off.</v>

1636
01:07:07.390 --> 01:07:10.210
<v Speaker 3>So I was over there for a month,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we saw a bunch of people and it was very</v>

1637
01:07:10.211 --> 01:07:12.610
<v Speaker 3>worthwhile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it got connected to this,</v>

1638
01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:15.100
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this organization and became good</v>

1639
01:07:15.101 --> 01:07:16.990
<v Speaker 3>friends with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with all the folks who run it and they</v>

1640
01:07:16.991 --> 01:07:19.750
<v Speaker 3>do amazing work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I got a call,</v>

1641
01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:23.470
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in January from one of the heads of the</v>

1642
01:07:23.471 --> 01:07:26.770
<v Speaker 3>organization says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we got this kind of Kooky thing that</v>

1643
01:07:26.771 --> 01:07:29.260
<v Speaker 3>we've been asked to do by the World</v>
<v Speaker 3>Health Organization.</v>

1644
01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:31.600
<v Speaker 3>Would you be interested?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kooky.</v>

1645
01:07:31.810 --> 01:07:33.380
<v Speaker 3>Kooky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The word,</v>

1646
01:07:33.580 --> 01:07:34.990
<v Speaker 3>that's the word he used.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kooky,</v>

1647
01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:38.260
<v Speaker 3>Kooky cheese.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just so who the fuck uses Kooky?</v>

1648
01:07:38.620 --> 01:07:39.850
<v Speaker 3>So it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1649
01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:42.610
<v Speaker 3>I mean it comes to going to Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 3>12 years in medical school,</v>

1650
01:07:43.170 --> 01:07:45.360
<v Speaker 3>not understanding what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fire is,</v>

1651
01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:47.340
<v Speaker 3>it was a little bit cookie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So He's,</v>

1652
01:07:47.350 --> 01:07:49.270
<v Speaker 3>he frames it up for me and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

1653
01:07:49.271 --> 01:07:52.000
<v Speaker 3>here's what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've been asked by the World Health</v>

1654
01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:55.750
<v Speaker 3>Organization to go in and be a trauma</v>
<v Speaker 3>stabilization point in Mosul,</v>

1655
01:07:56.710 --> 01:08:01.710
<v Speaker 3>which means you will be as close to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>front line as possible.</v>

1656
01:08:02.190 --> 01:08:07.190
<v Speaker 3>Embedded with the Iraqi special</v>
<v Speaker 3>operations forces and your job will be</v>

1657
01:08:07.690 --> 01:08:12.610
<v Speaker 3>to lead a medical team of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we had nine of us,</v>

1658
01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:14.430
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1659
01:08:14.470 --> 01:08:16.670
<v Speaker 3>within 2000</v>

1660
01:08:16.700 --> 01:08:20.360
<v Speaker 2>meters of the front line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the way it was framed up and</v>

1661
01:08:20.361 --> 01:08:22.820
<v Speaker 2>that's what we all sort of signed up</v>
<v Speaker 2>for.</v>

1662
01:08:22.821 --> 01:08:24.890
<v Speaker 2>And that was the agreement with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>World Health Organization.</v>

1663
01:08:24.891 --> 01:08:29.891
<v Speaker 2>And so we would be the first point of</v>
<v Speaker 2>contact as these Iraqi special</v>

1664
01:08:30.501 --> 01:08:34.070
<v Speaker 2>operations guys were going in and</v>
<v Speaker 2>putting the fight to isis to liberate</v>

1665
01:08:34.071 --> 01:08:35.900
<v Speaker 2>western Mozel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1666
01:08:35.930 --> 01:08:37.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eastern Mozal been limited.</v>

1667
01:08:37.251 --> 01:08:38.600
<v Speaker 2>We're liberated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1668
01:08:38.630 --> 01:08:41.900
<v Speaker 2>months before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he volunteered for this by the way.</v>

1669
01:08:42.770 --> 01:08:45.590
<v Speaker 2>So that's all eastern Mosul and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] side of the Tigers.</v>

1670
01:08:45.650 --> 01:08:47.030
<v Speaker 2>And then on the west side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1671
01:08:47.060 --> 01:08:51.200
<v Speaker 2>Isis was still sort of dug in right</v>
<v Speaker 2>there and they were there ready to put</v>

1672
01:08:51.201 --> 01:08:53.690
<v Speaker 2>the fight down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They wanted to get after it and save,</v>

1673
01:08:53.900 --> 01:08:55.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where their caliphates supposedly</v>

1674
01:08:55.791 --> 01:08:57.680
<v Speaker 2>started or was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was settled.</v>

1675
01:08:58.250 --> 01:09:01.310
<v Speaker 2>And so our job is to Tsp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's trauma stabilization point was to</v>

1676
01:09:01.311 --> 01:09:02.450
<v Speaker 2>be as close to the front lines.</v>

1677
01:09:02.450 --> 01:09:03.920
<v Speaker 2>We could be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is the,</v>

1678
01:09:03.980 --> 01:09:05.310
<v Speaker 2>this was a kicker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1679
01:09:05.330 --> 01:09:08.510
<v Speaker 2>within a margin of safety,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but still be close enough to where we</v>

1680
01:09:08.511 --> 01:09:12.320
<v Speaker 2>could receive the casualties as quickly</v>
<v Speaker 2>as possible,</v>

1681
01:09:12.380 --> 01:09:16.970
<v Speaker 2>stabilize them and then get them to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ford operating operating suite,</v>

1682
01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:20.570
<v Speaker 2>which was typically run by allied</v>
<v Speaker 2>forces.</v>

1683
01:09:20.571 --> 01:09:22.340
<v Speaker 2>So our guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1684
01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:25.880
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said yes before I asked my wife,</v>

1685
01:09:26.150 --> 01:09:30.050
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which now in retrospect probably wasn't</v>

1686
01:09:30.051 --> 01:09:32.600
<v Speaker 2>the best strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1687
01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:37.100
<v Speaker 2>cause she was not super stoked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she,</v>

1688
01:09:37.310 --> 01:09:38.091
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1689
01:09:38.091 --> 01:09:43.091
<v Speaker 2>I pitched it to her and I've got an 11</v>
<v Speaker 2>year old kid and she gave me I think the</v>

1690
01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:52.160
<v Speaker 2>least amount of pushback as anybody</v>
<v Speaker 2>around me and my close network.</v>

1691
01:09:52.281 --> 01:09:55.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean a lot of my boys were like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck dude.</v>

1692
01:09:55.011 --> 01:09:56.440
<v Speaker 2>What are you thinking man?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what's,</v>

1693
01:09:56.450 --> 01:09:57.830
<v Speaker 2>what are you getting?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's your point?</v>

1694
01:09:57.860 --> 01:09:59.060
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing this for?</v>

1695
01:09:59.300 --> 01:10:03.020
<v Speaker 2>What's your intention to go over there</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a war zone,</v>

1696
01:10:03.021 --> 01:10:05.240
<v Speaker 2>to a combat zone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>volunteering,</v>

1697
01:10:05.241 --> 01:10:06.074
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1698
01:10:06.290 --> 01:10:07.460
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1699
01:10:07.670 --> 01:10:10.730
<v Speaker 2>and helping a group of people that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have no affinity for.</v>

1700
01:10:10.731 --> 01:10:13.610
<v Speaker 2>It made sense going into Paul,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause I love Nepal,</v>

1701
01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:15.600
<v Speaker 2>I love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love everything about Nepal.</v>

1702
01:10:15.650 --> 01:10:17.930
<v Speaker 2>Love the Nepali people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that good.</v>

1703
01:10:17.931 --> 01:10:19.730
<v Speaker 2>Everybody got that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the weird thing about jeff</v>

1704
01:10:19.731 --> 01:10:21.650
<v Speaker 2>because he was on the phone with me the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same time saying,</v>

1705
01:10:21.651 --> 01:10:23.120
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are we going back to Everest?</v>

1706
01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:25.220
<v Speaker 2>Go rescue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's going to no matter what,</v>

1707
01:10:25.221 --> 01:10:28.250
<v Speaker 2>sometime in the spring he can put his</v>
<v Speaker 2>ass on the line to help save people.</v>

1708
01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:30.140
<v Speaker 2>He was calling me again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going back and I'm like,</v>

1709
01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:33.050
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if we're going back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the network may order another season.</v>

1710
01:10:33.051 --> 01:10:35.880
<v Speaker 2>We'd probably go back and I started</v>
<v Speaker 2>lining stuff up and just in case then it</v>

1711
01:10:35.890 --> 01:10:37.410
<v Speaker 2>was aired yet.</v>

<v Speaker 2>places too.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So people could get it right?</v>

1719

01:11:00.351 --> 01:11:03.020
<v Speaker 2>So she knew she was kind of getting a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit of a,</v>

1726
01:11:03.860 --> 01:11:05.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit of a,</v>

1727
01:11:05.061 --> 01:11:07.790
<v Speaker 2>of a wild book in her hands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1728
01:11:08.060 --> 01:11:09.650
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was different,</v>

1729
01:11:09.710 --> 01:11:10.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can go climbing,</v>

1730
01:11:10.910 --> 01:11:14.340
<v Speaker 2>I can set my sights on this and that get</v>
<v Speaker 2>out there in the mountains</v>

1731
01:11:14.340 --> 01:11:16.650
<v Speaker 3>or do adventure races and stuff and all</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's cool.</v>

1732
01:11:16.651 --> 01:11:17.670
<v Speaker 3>But then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1733
01:11:18.300 --> 01:11:21.480
<v Speaker 3>mad respect to the men and women that</v>
<v Speaker 3>serve in our military man and put it out</v>

1734
01:11:21.481 --> 01:11:23.520
<v Speaker 3>there every day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I had never been in a combat zone</v>

1735
01:11:23.521 --> 01:11:24.780
<v Speaker 3>and that shit is crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1736
01:11:24.810 --> 01:11:25.561
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is,</v>

1737
01:11:25.561 --> 01:11:28.290
<v Speaker 3>it was real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1738
01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:30.330
<v Speaker 3>and I have no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1739
01:11:30.930 --> 01:11:35.070
<v Speaker 3>predications that I had any experience</v>
<v Speaker 3>close to what our men and women have</v>

1740
01:11:35.071 --> 01:11:37.590
<v Speaker 3>experienced.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But from a medical perspective,</v>

1741
01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:41.250
<v Speaker 3>it was intense to say the least.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1742
01:11:41.251 --> 01:11:43.200
<v Speaker 3>it was a mind bender at the first,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after,</v>

1743
01:11:43.380 --> 01:11:46.650
<v Speaker 3>after the first three days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember texting my wife just saying</v>

1744
01:11:46.651 --> 01:11:48.690
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if this is sustainable,</v>

1745
01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:50.940
<v Speaker 3>like just this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my emotional state,</v>

1746
01:11:50.941 --> 01:11:55.941
<v Speaker 3>because every day was immense volume of</v>
<v Speaker 3>profound penetrating trauma.</v>

1747
01:11:57.780 --> 01:11:58.613
<v Speaker 3>Panic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1748
01:11:58.890 --> 01:12:00.150
<v Speaker 3>never was there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very,</v>

1749
01:12:00.180 --> 01:12:02.670
<v Speaker 3>very rarely was there a guy who had one</v>
<v Speaker 3>gunshot wound,</v>

1750
01:12:03.210 --> 01:12:04.260
<v Speaker 3>typically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1751
01:12:04.261 --> 01:12:05.250
<v Speaker 3>seven or eight or nine.</v>

1752
01:12:05.250 --> 01:12:06.940
<v Speaker 3>They were leaking from there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1753
01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:09.180
<v Speaker 3>from lots of places.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1754
01:12:09.181 --> 01:12:13.590
<v Speaker 3>these dudes were getting shot up and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then the ids and um,</v>

1755
01:12:13.620 --> 01:12:15.390
<v Speaker 3>would blow these guys up and we would</v>
<v Speaker 3>get them,</v>

1756
01:12:15.420 --> 01:12:16.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'd be youngest.</v>

1757
01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:18.990
<v Speaker 3>This was just screaming and drop these</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys off.</v>

1758
01:12:18.991 --> 01:12:21.660
<v Speaker 3>And then five minutes later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>another ambulance would come in with two</v>

1759
01:12:21.661 --> 01:12:23.580
<v Speaker 3>other dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was just constant,</v>

1760
01:12:23.581 --> 01:12:27.450
<v Speaker 3>constant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we would do the best we could,</v>

1761
01:12:27.870 --> 01:12:31.140
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to stabilize them or call it.</v>

1762
01:12:31.650 --> 01:12:34.650
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ones we could save,</v>

1763
01:12:34.651 --> 01:12:37.380
<v Speaker 3>we package them up and stabilize and try</v>
<v Speaker 3>to control the bleeding.</v>

1764
01:12:37.381 --> 01:12:40.890
<v Speaker 3>We'd intubate him if we needed to and</v>
<v Speaker 3>put chest tubes in and,</v>

1765
01:12:40.950 --> 01:12:45.710
<v Speaker 3>and crack them in some cases and</v>
<v Speaker 3>stabilize their extremities and pat's</v>

1766
01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:50.460
<v Speaker 3>their halls and then send them on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would do these weekly daily blogs,</v>

1767
01:12:50.461 --> 01:12:51.630
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So people who know him,</v>

1768
01:12:51.631 --> 01:12:52.560
<v Speaker 3>Rove there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're waiting,</v>

1769
01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:54.990
<v Speaker 3>watching CNN,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seeing if he's going to be on what he</v>

1770
01:12:54.991 --> 01:12:55.620
<v Speaker 3>was.</v>

1771
01:12:55.620 --> 01:12:57.420
<v Speaker 3>And he'd do these daily blogs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these long,</v>

1772
01:12:57.421 --> 01:13:00.000
<v Speaker 3>long diatribe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is I think how he stays somewhat</v>

1773
01:13:00.001 --> 01:13:02.610
<v Speaker 3>sane,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but to get shot at,</v>

1774
01:13:02.611 --> 01:13:06.900
<v Speaker 3>there's motors come in and their</v>
<v Speaker 3>compound to where are these blocks on my</v>

1775
01:13:06.901 --> 01:13:08.060
<v Speaker 3>blog?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1776
01:13:08.220 --> 01:13:08.941
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Jeff Bm.</v>

1778
01:13:10.341 --> 01:13:11.810
<v Speaker 3>And so there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like to write,</v>

1779

<v Speaker 3>do you haven't dot com [inaudible] dot</v>
<v Speaker 3>com so I like to write and Budgie right.</v>

1780
01:13:16.020 --> 01:13:17.730
<v Speaker 3>And I like to have the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1781
01:13:17.731 --> 01:13:21.150
<v Speaker 3>so this is what I would do at night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if I would lay down and we were</v>

1782
01:13:21.151 --> 01:13:23.070
<v Speaker 3>sleeping on the floor on these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1783
01:13:23.071 --> 01:13:25.980
<v Speaker 3>these Iraqi blankets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1784
01:13:25.981 --> 01:13:27.660
<v Speaker 3>and we would just lay down on this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

1785
01:13:27.730 --> 01:13:31.320
<v Speaker 3>so we'd go into these abandoned homes</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we'd set up these trauma bays and</v>

1786
01:13:31.321 --> 01:13:34.530
<v Speaker 3>we'd sleep in a room off the trauma bay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I,</v>

1787
01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:35.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

1788
01:13:35.070 --> 01:13:35.920
<v Speaker 3>we do our day.</v>

1789
01:13:35.980 --> 01:13:39.600
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I very rarely wasn't dressed and ready</v>

1790
01:13:39.601 --> 01:13:43.620
<v Speaker 3>to get up and go because then any tom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the head logistician,</v>

1791
01:13:43.621 --> 01:13:45.960
<v Speaker 3>we'd be like patients,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1792
01:13:45.961 --> 01:13:48.400
<v Speaker 3>and everybody would pop up and get</v>
<v Speaker 3>ready,</v>

1793
01:13:48.420 --> 01:13:50.580
<v Speaker 3>didn't go out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the ambulance would throw people on.</v>

1794
01:13:50.610 --> 01:13:54.510
<v Speaker 3>Mostly during the day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but fighting with generally subside at</v>

1795
01:13:54.511 --> 01:13:58.530
<v Speaker 3>night and we'd get a little bit of rest</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I'd write and I'd write and it</v>

1796
01:13:58.531 --> 01:14:01.160
<v Speaker 3>was important I think to sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1797
01:14:01.470 --> 01:14:03.660
<v Speaker 3>percolate that shit out a little bit and</v>
<v Speaker 3>let it,</v>

1798
01:14:03.780 --> 01:14:05.520
<v Speaker 3>let it sit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we were,</v>

1799
01:14:05.521 --> 01:14:10.521
<v Speaker 3>we were in this one place for a couple</v>
<v Speaker 3>of weeks and then came the request from,</v>

1800
01:14:11.830 --> 01:14:15.010
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the head of ice off special operations,</v>

1801
01:14:15.011 --> 01:14:18.310
<v Speaker 3>General Abbas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's came to our head logistical gal</v>

1802
01:14:18.311 --> 01:14:19.120
<v Speaker 3>and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

1803
01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:21.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as the front line is moving forward,</v>

1804
01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:27.120
<v Speaker 3>we would like for you guys if you are up</v>
<v Speaker 3>for it to move forward as well.</v>

1805
01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:31.230
<v Speaker 3>The only problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1806
01:14:31.510 --> 01:14:34.570
<v Speaker 3>it's not going to be within that 10 to</v>
<v Speaker 3>2,500,</v>

1807
01:14:35.020 --> 01:14:36.000

<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1808
01:14:36.460 --> 01:14:41.460
<v Speaker 3>meter cushion from the front line.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be more like 500 meters</v>

1809
01:14:41.980 --> 01:14:44.800
<v Speaker 3>from the front line.</v>
<v Speaker 3>500 meters.</v>

1811
01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:50.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's really class really close,</v>

1812
01:14:50.021 --> 01:14:52.540
<v Speaker 3>especially since the front line is</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty fluid anyway.</v>

1813
01:14:52.660 --> 01:14:54.730
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is a conventional warfare,</v>

1814
01:14:54.731 --> 01:14:55.810
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>These guys are,</v>

01:15:49.330 --> 01:15:50.320
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

1841
01:15:50.321 --> 01:15:51.154
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

1842
01:15:51.370 --> 01:15:54.010
<v Speaker 3>of artillery that was set up all around</v>
<v Speaker 3>us,</v>

1843
01:15:54.250 --> 01:15:57.700
<v Speaker 3>outgoing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we got used to the sound of outgoing</v>

1844
01:15:57.701 --> 01:16:01.600
<v Speaker 3>artillery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we didn't hear a lot of incoming,</v>

1845
01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:03.430
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they just did pushed him back.</v>

1846
01:16:03.431 --> 01:16:03.881
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1847
01:16:03.881 --> 01:16:05.500
<v Speaker 3>We all said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's do it,</v>

1848
01:16:05.590 --> 01:16:07.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we can create positive impact and we</v>

1849
01:16:07.721 --> 01:16:10.030
<v Speaker 3>can save more lives by being closer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's do it.</v>

1850
01:16:10.570 --> 01:16:14.020
<v Speaker 3>So we all gotten this big osh kosh and</v>
<v Speaker 3>Humvee,</v>

1851
01:16:14.250 --> 01:16:17.590
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>convoy and uh,</v>

1852
01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:20.290
<v Speaker 3>and drove down past the airport.</v>

1853
01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:22.060
<v Speaker 3>And I think a lot of military folks that</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

1854
01:16:22.090 --> 01:16:23.860
<v Speaker 3>we'll know that airport,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1855
01:16:23.930 --> 01:16:25.990
<v Speaker 3>in west Mosul very well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably.</v>

1856
01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:28.300
<v Speaker 3>We drove right through the old busted</v>
<v Speaker 3>up,</v>

1857
01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:29.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1858
01:16:29.771 --> 01:16:31.750
<v Speaker 3>it was just rubble,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole airports rebel.</v>

1859
01:16:31.751 --> 01:16:34.000
<v Speaker 3>It's just completely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it looks like fucking,</v>

1861
01:16:36.461 --> 01:16:37.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just a mess.</v>

1862
01:16:37.810 --> 01:16:41.770
<v Speaker 3>Drove all the way through there and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>went to this house and we set up our</v>

1863
01:16:41.771 --> 01:16:44.610
<v Speaker 3>clinic on a street corner,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1864
01:16:44.650 --> 01:16:48.670
<v Speaker 3>covered by an a corrugated metal roof</v>
<v Speaker 3>and put all our,</v>

1865
01:16:48.750 --> 01:16:51.000
<v Speaker 3>and we put six trauma beds and got her</v>
<v Speaker 3>traumas,</v>

1866
01:16:51.001 --> 01:16:52.690
<v Speaker 3>sleeves up and everything was ready to</v>
<v Speaker 3>go.</v>

1867
01:16:52.691 --> 01:16:55.870
<v Speaker 3>And then we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we set up our residents across the</v>

1868
01:16:55.871 --> 01:16:57.820
<v Speaker 3>street at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1869
01:16:57.880 --> 01:17:01.480
<v Speaker 3>some other abandoned house and we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>down in the sort of concrete bunker,</v>

1870
01:17:01.510 --> 01:17:06.010
<v Speaker 3>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we started seeing patients and,</v>

1871
01:17:06.011 --> 01:17:07.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>day one,</v>

1872
01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:10.450
<v Speaker 3>shit ton of people and of lots of things</v>
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>

1873
01:17:10.460 --> 01:17:13.610
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking dozens and dozens of,</v>

1874
01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:17.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>multiple gunshot when paces multiple</v>

1875
01:17:17.571 --> 01:17:22.490
<v Speaker 3>careers that I experienced in that month</v>
<v Speaker 3>of just the flow of volume of,</v>

1876
01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:24.500
<v Speaker 3>of penetrating trauma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then,</v>

1877
01:17:24.620 --> 01:17:25.453
<v Speaker 3>then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1878
01:17:25.970 --> 01:17:30.260
<v Speaker 3>it was day two or three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these displaced locals,</v>

1879
01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:33.230
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>basically got released,</v>

1880
01:17:34.670 --> 01:17:37.790
<v Speaker 3>so they'd been holding him at a</v>
<v Speaker 3>checkpoint fingerprint and the fighting</v>

1881
01:17:37.791 --> 01:17:41.570
<v Speaker 3>age males,</v>
<v Speaker 3>making sure they're not on a record and,</v>

1882
01:17:41.571 --> 01:17:43.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>making sure everybody's not,</v>

1883
01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:46.370
<v Speaker 3>not strapped and letting them through.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So on day three or four,</v>

1884
01:17:46.371 --> 01:17:50.420
<v Speaker 3>they just let this flow of humanity</v>
<v Speaker 3>started walking down the street,</v>

1885
01:17:50.421 --> 01:17:53.450
<v Speaker 3>about 60,</v>
<v Speaker 3>70 yards from us,</v>

1886
01:17:53.480 --> 01:17:58.400
<v Speaker 3>from where we were set up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they'd see the Americans and they'd</v>

1887
01:17:58.401 --> 01:18:02.240
<v Speaker 3>see the stethoscopes and they just start</v>
<v Speaker 3>running towards us because these people</v>

1888
01:18:02.241 --> 01:18:05.870
<v Speaker 3>had been captivated for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1889
01:18:05.871 --> 01:18:06.830
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1890
01:18:06.860 --> 01:18:09.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>held captive and hiding out in their</v>

1891
01:18:09.531 --> 01:18:11.360
<v Speaker 3>basements,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eaten grass,</v>

1892
01:18:11.930 --> 01:18:15.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to find any fluids at all to</v>

1893
01:18:15.451 --> 01:18:15.770
<v Speaker 3>drink.</v>

1894
01:18:15.770 --> 01:18:16.990
<v Speaker 3>There's no rain water,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1895
01:18:17.010 --> 01:18:18.560
<v Speaker 3>is this fucking rain there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1896
01:18:19.010 --> 01:18:20.930
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just just eking by.</v>

1897
01:18:21.230 --> 01:18:23.150
<v Speaker 3>And little kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's just civilians,</v>

1898
01:18:23.151 --> 01:18:26.060
<v Speaker 3>these little bitty kids and they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>hiding out in these,</v>

1899
01:18:26.061 --> 01:18:28.160
<v Speaker 3>in these homes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they would just run,</v>

1900
01:18:28.190 --> 01:18:31.160
<v Speaker 3>they would just take off running and get</v>
<v Speaker 3>to these checkpoints.</v>

1901
01:18:31.430 --> 01:18:32.950
<v Speaker 3>So on day three or something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1902
01:18:33.070 --> 01:18:36.350
<v Speaker 3>this flow of humanity comes by.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You guys are starting to sort of bum</v>

1903
01:18:36.351 --> 01:18:40.520
<v Speaker 3>rush our spot and everybody starts to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get a little bit panicked cause we</v>

1904
01:18:40.521 --> 01:18:43.010
<v Speaker 3>weren't quite sure what was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

1905
01:18:43.011 --> 01:18:44.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot,</v>

1906
01:18:44.420 --> 01:18:45.950
<v Speaker 3>it turns out a lot of bad things can</v>
<v Speaker 3>happen,</v>

1907
01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:47.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in that situation.</v>

1908
01:18:47.421 --> 01:18:51.710
<v Speaker 3>So we sort of get our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our security detail to keep everybody</v>

1909
01:18:51.711 --> 01:18:54.410
<v Speaker 3>away and we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we treat a shit ton of people.</v>

1910
01:18:55.070 --> 01:18:59.450
<v Speaker 3>Day four rolls around and we wake up</v>
<v Speaker 3>that morning.</v>

1911
01:18:59.451 --> 01:19:04.310
<v Speaker 3>And the first patient I have is a five</v>
<v Speaker 3>year old little girl that had been just</v>

1912
01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:08.090
<v Speaker 3>absolutely like homicide,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like killed shot right in the head,</v>

<v Speaker 3>back of the head.</v>

1914
01:19:10.130 --> 01:19:12.500

<v Speaker 3>And that was how our day started at like</v>

1915
01:19:13.700 --> 01:19:15.230
<v Speaker 3>seven in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was it.</v>

1916
01:19:15.830 --> 01:19:17.360
<v Speaker 3>And the day got worse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1917
01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:22.480
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first incoming landed about,</v>

1918
01:19:24.350 --> 01:19:27.620
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd say about 75 yards from us,</v>

1919
01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:30.410
<v Speaker 3>an RPG.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It landed in the neighbor in the</v>

1920
01:19:30.411 --> 01:19:34.430
<v Speaker 3>neighbor's yard next to us and it just</v>
<v Speaker 3>blew a bunch of debris up and it landed</v>

1921
01:19:34.431 --> 01:19:38.870
<v Speaker 3>on our corrugated roof there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we were all like,</v>

1922
01:19:38.871 --> 01:19:40.550
<v Speaker 3>damn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we kept working.</v>

1923
01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:45.560
<v Speaker 3>Then 10 minutes later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe another one came in and it was 50</v>

1924
01:19:45.561 --> 01:19:48.950
<v Speaker 3>yards and just getting closer this</v>
<v Speaker 3>second,</v>

<v Speaker 3>So we didn't know it at the top though,</v>

1927
01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:55.750
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're right.</v>

1928
01:19:55.750 --> 01:19:58.160
<v Speaker 3>That we did not know this at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1929
01:19:58.520 --> 01:20:02.580
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that one obviously got everybody Super</v>

<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1931
01:20:03.020 --> 01:20:06.290
<v Speaker 3>but there was still a shit ton of people</v>
<v Speaker 3>coming in.</v>

1932
01:20:06.290 --> 01:20:11.070
<v Speaker 3>We had patients mean we were working and</v>
<v Speaker 3>we had our kevlar vests on and we were</v>

1933
01:20:11.071 --> 01:20:11.701
<v Speaker 3>trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1934
01:20:11.701 --> 01:20:16.680
<v Speaker 3>say then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then the third one hit and it landed,</v>

1935
01:20:16.980 --> 01:20:21.480
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right outside the door and it blew a</v>

1936
01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:23.100
<v Speaker 3>shit ton of debris.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1937
01:20:23.101 --> 01:20:27.660
<v Speaker 3>we felt the blast and one of our medics</v>
<v Speaker 3>got a big piece of debris in the back</v>

<v Speaker 3>It knocked him down.</v>

1939
01:20:28.921 --> 01:20:32.610
<v Speaker 3>So we went into this bunker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>basically the staging bunker and we sat</v>

1940
01:20:32.611 --> 01:20:36.180

<v Speaker 3>I wasn't about to ask anybody to go out</v>
<v Speaker 3>into that.</v>

1956
01:21:12.090 --> 01:21:16.350
<v Speaker 3>And no one even hesitated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we went out and started working on</v>

1957
01:21:16.351 --> 01:21:18.270
<v Speaker 3>how Steve and we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

1958
01:21:18.271 --> 01:21:21.600
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we got on and quick and he was out and I</v>

1959
01:21:21.601 --> 01:21:23.670
<v Speaker 3>listened to his lungs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't have any lung sounds.</v>

1960
01:21:23.671 --> 01:21:26.700
<v Speaker 3>On one side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw penetrating entry wound in his</v>

1961
01:21:26.701 --> 01:21:28.560
<v Speaker 3>chest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put a chest tube in his,</v>

1962
01:21:28.950 --> 01:21:29.820
<v Speaker 3>in his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1963
01:21:29.910 --> 01:21:30.810
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1964
01:21:30.870 --> 01:21:34.800
<v Speaker 3>and his right thorax and about a liter</v>
<v Speaker 3>of blood poured out from his pleural</v>

1965
01:21:34.801 --> 01:21:37.410
<v Speaker 3>space just like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And as soon as that happened,</v>

1966
01:21:37.860 --> 01:21:40.560
<v Speaker 3>he could inspire again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so we started breathing and</v>

1967
01:21:41.460 --> 01:21:44.400
<v Speaker 3>resuscitated him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he was dead and he came back to lunch</v>

1968
01:21:44.401 --> 01:21:45.810
<v Speaker 3>and he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was,</v>

1969
01:21:45.870 --> 01:21:48.960
<v Speaker 3>he was unable to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to inspire.</v>

1970
01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:49.950
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1971
01:21:49.951 --> 01:21:52.800
<v Speaker 3>his whole body had shut down from number</v>
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>

1972
01:21:52.801 --> 01:21:54.900
<v Speaker 3>from the shock blast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1973
01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:58.140
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and being hit that hard by,</v>

1974
01:21:58.230 --> 01:22:01.800
<v Speaker 3>by a piece of shrapnel and just being</v>
<v Speaker 3>that close to the impact.</v>

1975
01:22:02.130 --> 01:22:03.270
<v Speaker 3>But then also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1976
01:22:03.271 --> 01:22:07.080
<v Speaker 3>there's penetrating a piece of shrapnel</v>
<v Speaker 3>went right through his chest and didn't</v>

1977
01:22:07.081 --> 01:22:11.580
<v Speaker 3>hit any of his vital organs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just cause this hemothorax this blood to</v>

1978
01:22:11.581 --> 01:22:13.350
<v Speaker 3>fill up in his plural space.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1979
01:22:13.351 --> 01:22:15.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I evacuated all that blood and he</v>

1980
01:22:15.511 --> 01:22:17.820
<v Speaker 3>started to be able to breathe again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there he is,</v>

1981
01:22:17.821 --> 01:22:19.110
<v Speaker 3>he's back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We get him out,</v>

1982
01:22:19.500 --> 01:22:21.870
<v Speaker 3>we go back inside the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the uh,</v>

1983
01:22:21.900 --> 01:22:24.600
<v Speaker 3>the bunker there and a couple of hours</v>
<v Speaker 3>later we got out.</v>

1984
01:22:24.601 --> 01:22:29.601
<v Speaker 3>So we find out the next day that a dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not a fighting age,</v>

1985
01:22:31.620 --> 01:22:36.620
<v Speaker 3>a local guy was a sleeper cell and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had come back in the neighborhood and</v>

1986
01:22:37.171 --> 01:22:42.171
<v Speaker 3>was three or four houses down and was</v>
<v Speaker 3>communicating with his operatives,</v>

1987
01:22:42.990 --> 01:22:45.540
<v Speaker 3>his Isis Bros,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1988
01:22:45.870 --> 01:22:49.020
<v Speaker 3>two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>300 meters away and was releasing</v>

1989
01:22:49.021 --> 01:22:51.690
<v Speaker 3>pigeons to identify our position.</v>

1990
01:22:52.380 --> 01:22:54.960
<v Speaker 3>So the way they figured this out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of our security guys would see a</v>

1991
01:22:54.961 --> 01:22:57.330
<v Speaker 3>pigeon go up and he didn't think much</v>
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>

1992
01:22:57.331 --> 01:23:00.270
<v Speaker 3>And then a mortar hit and then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1993
01:23:00.390 --> 01:23:03.360
<v Speaker 3>10 minutes later he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was no pigeons around there.</v>

1994
01:23:03.361 --> 01:23:04.171
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause I mean,</v>

1995
01:23:04.171 --> 01:23:07.570
<v Speaker 3>Shit's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's combat zone and birds don't dig</v>

1996
01:23:07.571 --> 01:23:11.560
<v Speaker 3>combat zones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he kind of started to piece it</v>

1997
01:23:11.561 --> 01:23:14.800
<v Speaker 3>together and then he realized on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>third one he's like,</v>

1998
01:23:14.801 --> 01:23:17.050
<v Speaker 3>he saw a pigeon go up and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're about to get hit.</v>

1999
01:23:17.380 --> 01:23:20.740
<v Speaker 3>Sure enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we got out of there,</v>

2000
01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:21.880
<v Speaker 3>saves us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he gives life.</v>

2001
01:23:21.881 --> 01:23:25.600
<v Speaker 3>He got out and they went and found this</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude and got his phone.</v>

2002
01:23:25.601 --> 01:23:27.640
<v Speaker 3>And sure enough he was doing all this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Any admitted it.</v>

2003
01:23:27.700 --> 01:23:28.533
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep,</v>

2004
01:23:28.630 --> 01:23:29.800
<v Speaker 3>that was me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was doing,</v>

2005
01:23:29.801 --> 01:23:31.990
<v Speaker 3>I was releasing pigeons to identify your</v>
<v Speaker 3>spot.</v>

2006
01:23:32.680 --> 01:23:35.530
<v Speaker 3>And I was told they took care of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>situation.</v>

2007
01:23:35.710 --> 01:23:38.170
<v Speaker 3>That was what they tried to kill the</v>
<v Speaker 3>American tour and trying to help</v>

2008
01:23:38.171 --> 01:23:39.160
<v Speaker 3>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2009
01:23:39.430 --> 01:23:40.990
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I just wanted us,</v>

2010
01:23:40.991 --> 01:23:42.760
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they wanted to get us because we were</v>

2011
01:23:42.761 --> 01:23:43.750
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were helping the enemy.</v>

2012
01:23:43.751 --> 01:23:45.880
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that was,</v>

2013
01:23:46.660 --> 01:23:48.880
<v Speaker 3>that was a couple months ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they documented on his,</v>

2014
01:23:48.881 --> 01:23:51.470
<v Speaker 3>on his website,</v>
<v Speaker 3>CNN was interviewing him and there</v>

2015
01:23:51.880 --> 01:23:55.030
<v Speaker 3>there's mortars dropping crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2016
01:23:55.031 --> 01:23:56.770
<v Speaker 3>It was heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It took a little you over there for</v>

2017
01:23:56.771 --> 01:23:57.960
<v Speaker 3>about a month.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2018
01:23:58.200 --> 01:23:59.710
<v Speaker 3>But aside,</v>

<v Speaker 3>they knew this ngo knows like it was</v>

2021
01:24:04.991 --> 01:24:07.120
<v Speaker 3>hard to sustain that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2022
01:24:07.121 --> 01:24:10.750
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2023
01:24:10.751 --> 01:24:11.411

<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2024
01:24:11.411 --> 01:24:14.860
<v Speaker 3>that's why so many of our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our military folks have such profound</v>

2025
01:24:14.861 --> 01:24:15.880
<v Speaker 3>ptsd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

<v Speaker 3>the hills like a few days later and we</v>
<v Speaker 3>got up to the top of this hill and I</v>

<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just cried on her shoulder.</v>

<v Speaker 3>But it gives me such a deep appreciation</v>

2047
01:25:03.881 --> 01:25:08.260

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2048
01:25:08.261 --> 01:25:12.130
<v Speaker 3>for these men and women who come back</v>
<v Speaker 3>from these deployments and they've been</v>

2049
01:25:12.131 --> 01:25:15.490
<v Speaker 3>a part of these things and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and been affected so profoundly.</v>

2050
01:25:15.490 --> 01:25:16.323
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2051
01:25:16.330 --> 01:25:17.920
<v Speaker 3>it's got to hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2052
01:25:18.100 --> 01:25:22.990
<v Speaker 3>I'm on a very deep emotional level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can only imagine,</v>

2053
01:25:22.991 --> 01:25:25.450
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what a crazy life you live helping</v>

2054
01:25:25.451 --> 01:25:29.360
<v Speaker 3>people that are involved in traumatic</v>
<v Speaker 3>situations over and over again,</v>

2055
01:25:29.380 --> 01:25:33.430
<v Speaker 3>various traumatic situations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's getting stuck on Kaytoo or</v>

2056
01:25:33.431 --> 01:25:35.200
<v Speaker 3>whether it's getting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2057
01:25:35.470 --> 01:25:36.960
<v Speaker 3>but he seeks it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what he does.</v>

2058
01:25:36.961 --> 01:25:38.170
<v Speaker 3>I just wanted to bring him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he sees like,</v>

2059
01:25:38.171 --> 01:25:41.200
<v Speaker 3>what am I going to do this spring that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to change 50 people's lives?</v>

2060
01:25:41.860 --> 01:25:43.960
<v Speaker 3>Where's Kate too?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the twos in Pakistan.</v>

2061
01:25:43.961 --> 01:25:44.840
<v Speaker 3>Pakistan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2062
01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:47.720
<v Speaker 3>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that a more dangerous one than the</v>

2063
01:25:47.721 --> 01:25:49.930
<v Speaker 3>first?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think generally the consensus is it's</v>

2064
01:25:49.931 --> 01:25:52.060
<v Speaker 3>more technical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's more dangerous and it's not as</v>

2065
01:25:52.061 --> 01:25:52.960
<v Speaker 3>commercialized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2066
01:25:52.961 --> 01:25:55.090
<v Speaker 3>So it's not a same more technical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do they mean by that?</v>

2067
01:25:55.091 --> 01:25:58.060
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this longer bits of terrain that</v>

2068
01:25:58.061 --> 01:26:01.390
<v Speaker 3>require more high level technical</v>
<v Speaker 3>climbing skill,</v>

2069

<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2144
01:28:55.791 --> 01:28:57.530
<v Speaker 3>that's not a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where are you going?</v>

2145
01:28:57.531 --> 01:28:59.540
<v Speaker 3>And I didn't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should have questioned him.</v>

2146
01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:02.190
<v Speaker 3>Two weeks later we get a call,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to go up to 17,000</v>

2147
01:29:02.190 --> 01:29:07.190
<v Speaker 2>feet for a guy who had broken his ankle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we land the helicopter down at 17 and</v>

2148
01:29:07.861 --> 01:29:12.120
<v Speaker 2>he runs towards the helicopter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which everybody knows is you don't run</v>

2149
01:29:12.121 --> 01:29:13.490
<v Speaker 2>towards the helicopter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes a little lift.</v>

2150
01:29:13.620 --> 01:29:15.030
<v Speaker 2>He runs to the helicopter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2151
01:29:15.031 --> 01:29:17.430

<v Speaker 2>so it turns out he was just cold.</v>

2152
01:29:18.900 --> 01:29:22.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a lot of people just tap out and</v>

2153
01:29:22.531 --> 01:29:25.410
<v Speaker 2>because they know there's an</v>
<v Speaker 2>infrastructure around that,</v>

2154
01:29:25.411 --> 01:29:29.130
<v Speaker 2>we'll pull them out instead of being</v>
<v Speaker 2>accountable for themselves.</v>

2155
01:29:29.340 --> 01:29:32.310
<v Speaker 2>That's where I get pissed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we pulled this guy off and we</v>

2156
01:29:32.311 --> 01:29:35.130
<v Speaker 2>interviewed them and then jeff goes the</v>
<v Speaker 2>nicest thing.</v>

2157
01:29:35.131 --> 01:29:36.270
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a nice life,</v>

2158
01:29:36.271 --> 01:29:38.200
<v Speaker 2>walks up and just started to cuss it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Piss.</v>

2159
01:29:38.201 --> 01:29:39.590
<v Speaker 2>He's paid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't want to do an interview with</v>

2160
01:29:39.591 --> 01:29:43.170
<v Speaker 2>just the Johnny's gun in want to talk</v>
<v Speaker 2>about them and to know when you need.</v>

2161
01:29:43.180 --> 01:29:45.340
<v Speaker 2>It's very dangerous to fly a helicopter</v>
<v Speaker 2>that out too.</v>

2162
01:29:45.341 --> 01:29:46.081
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Selfish.</v>

2163
01:29:46.081 --> 01:29:48.030
<v Speaker 2>Anything can go wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we are,</v>

2164
01:29:48.090 --> 01:29:50.610
<v Speaker 2>our helicopter pilots were up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2165
01:29:50.670 --> 01:29:54.690
<v Speaker 2>absolutely the other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the military pilots got to be the best</v>

2166
01:29:54.691 --> 01:29:56.250
<v Speaker 2>helicopter pilots in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2167
01:29:56.251 --> 01:30:01.251
<v Speaker 2>these guys are so skilled and understand</v>
<v Speaker 2>what those conditions make you do as a</v>

2168
01:30:02.131 --> 01:30:02.970
<v Speaker 2>pilot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2169
01:30:02.971 --> 01:30:04.740
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was phenomenal.</v>

2170
01:30:04.741 --> 01:30:06.850
<v Speaker 2>But that being said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>machines break.</v>

2171
01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:10.950
<v Speaker 2>I put him in a helicopter one time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I put it the one to helicopters one time</v>

2172
01:30:11.100 --> 01:30:14.070
<v Speaker 2>and that helicopter and that pilot are</v>
<v Speaker 2>dead now.</v>

2173
01:30:14.550 --> 01:30:15.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>From that.</v>

2174
01:30:16.020 --> 01:30:16.501
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2175
01:30:16.501 --> 01:30:19.000
<v Speaker 2>like a few months later I was in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>front with Daca.</v>

2176
01:30:19.010 --> 01:30:20.580
<v Speaker 2>How I'm fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He crashed into a cliff.</v>

2177
01:30:21.550 --> 01:30:23.490
<v Speaker 2>Won't they won't name the company,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

2178
01:30:23.491 --> 01:30:25.710
<v Speaker 2>we that there was a one little flight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we put them in there.</v>

2179
01:30:25.711 --> 01:30:28.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then a rack that was a rickety old</v>

2180
01:30:28.411 --> 01:30:29.244
<v Speaker 2>helicopter</v>

2181
01:30:29.310 --> 01:30:34.310
<v Speaker 1>do all these really high stressful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high danger sort of situations.</v>

2182
01:30:36.150 --> 01:30:41.150
<v Speaker 1>You're constantly around people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>have this extremely high threshold for</v>

2183
01:30:41.880 --> 01:30:44.880
<v Speaker 1>the extremely high tolerance to</v>
<v Speaker 1>discomfort,</v>

2184
01:30:45.330 --> 01:30:46.710
<v Speaker 1>to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2185
01:30:46.711 --> 01:30:51.300
<v Speaker 1>pushing your endurance levels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>overcoming obstacles.</v>

2186
01:30:51.450 --> 01:30:54.960
<v Speaker 1>Like be you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're around people that are like</v>

2187
01:30:54.961 --> 01:30:58.260
<v Speaker 1>really solid human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they're very on.</v>

2188
01:30:58.290 --> 01:31:01.410
<v Speaker 1>Like we were talking about people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are willing to summit Everest people</v>

2189
01:31:01.411 --> 01:31:03.180
<v Speaker 1>that'll rescue people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That summit Everest,</v>

2190
01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:08.360
<v Speaker 1>people that are willing to do these</v>
<v Speaker 1>medical stations 500 yards or 500 meters</v>

2191
01:31:10.921 --> 01:31:12.570
<v Speaker 1>from the front line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2192
01:31:12.810 --> 01:31:16.500
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about some really solid</v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings,</v>

2193
01:31:16.501 --> 01:31:19.170
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very unusually solid human beings.</v>

2194
01:31:19.620 --> 01:31:22.980
<v Speaker 1>When you come back from that and deal</v>
<v Speaker 1>with people like,</v>

2195
01:31:22.981 --> 01:31:24.010
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fucking cell phone,</v>

2196
01:31:24.011 --> 01:31:25.230
<v Speaker 1>such a piece of shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2197
01:31:25.231 --> 01:31:25.850
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

2198
01:31:25.850 --> 01:31:27.120
<v Speaker 1>this traffic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

2199
01:31:27.300 --> 01:31:30.390
<v Speaker 1>Like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that one of the hardest transitions,</v>

2200
01:31:30.391 --> 01:31:33.540
<v Speaker 1>like the modern first world problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gripes,</v>

2201
01:31:33.541 --> 01:31:35.970
<v Speaker 1>the bullshit that people whine and bitch</v>
<v Speaker 1>about?</v>

01:31:36.110 --> 01:31:37.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2203
01:31:37.250 --> 01:31:42.250
<v Speaker 2>That was part of the discomfort I had</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I came back from my rack</v>

2204
01:31:42.801 --> 01:31:44.690
<v Speaker 2>specifically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

<v Speaker 3>random stroke of luck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2218
01:32:13.631 --> 01:32:17.470
<v Speaker 3>with good parents and a good family</v>
<v Speaker 3>structure and was given all the</v>

2219
01:32:17.471 --> 01:32:21.970
<v Speaker 3>opportunities that I was given and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't born and Mozal and hardened in a,</v>

2220
01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:25.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a seller from the most evil dudes on the</v>

2221
01:32:25.271 --> 01:32:26.051
<v Speaker 3>planet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I mean it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2223
01:32:26.920 --> 01:32:27.700
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's quite,</v>

2224
01:32:27.700 --> 01:32:32.470
<v Speaker 3>so I've come back and instead of getting</v>
<v Speaker 3>mad at those people are frustrated with</v>

2225
01:32:32.471 --> 01:32:35.770
<v Speaker 3>those people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just try and smile through it and just</v>

2226
01:32:35.771 --> 01:32:36.790
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2227
01:32:36.791 --> 01:32:38.020
<v Speaker 3>to myself like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2228
01:32:38.790 --> 01:32:42.460
<v Speaker 3>I've wished you could taste what I</v>
<v Speaker 3>tasted just not,</v>

2229
01:32:42.461 --> 01:32:43.930
<v Speaker 3>not long ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2230
01:32:43.931 --> 01:32:46.930
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it really recalibrated me.</v>

2231
01:32:47.470 --> 01:32:48.630
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where it's,</v>

2232
01:32:48.700 --> 01:32:49.940
<v Speaker 3>it just doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2233
01:32:49.990 --> 01:32:51.970
<v Speaker 3>I just let it teflon off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2234
01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:53.020
<v Speaker 3>to a certain extent.</v>

2235
01:32:54.130 --> 01:32:56.530
<v Speaker 3>And with regards to the people that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>work with,</v>

2236
01:32:56.531 --> 01:32:57.890
<v Speaker 3>I tend to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

2237
01:32:57.910 --> 01:33:00.550
<v Speaker 3>gravitate towards people who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2238
01:33:00.700 --> 01:33:05.170
<v Speaker 3>like these chaotic sort of environments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2239
01:33:05.830 --> 01:33:08.440
<v Speaker 3>and I got turned on to this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2240
01:33:08.470 --> 01:33:09.400
<v Speaker 3>this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was this,</v>

2241
01:33:09.430 --> 01:33:13.000
<v Speaker 3>this concept is acronym.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The American Military Academy kicked off</v>

2242
01:33:13.140 --> 01:33:14.480
<v Speaker 3>a few decades.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It goes,</v>

2243
01:33:14.990 --> 01:33:18.400
<v Speaker 3>I think 30 years ago or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they started referring to</v>

2244
01:33:18.401 --> 01:33:22.810
<v Speaker 3>working in these Vuca environment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>volatile,</v>

2245
01:33:22.811 --> 01:33:23.920
<v Speaker 3>uncertain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>chaotic,</v>

2246
01:33:23.921 --> 01:33:28.921
<v Speaker 3>ambiguous environment and how we operate</v>
<v Speaker 3>in those environments and how true</v>

2247
01:33:29.291 --> 01:33:34.180
<v Speaker 3>champions and leaders like Alex can</v>
<v Speaker 3>operate in these places and these</v>

2248
01:33:34.181 --> 01:33:37.900
<v Speaker 3>atmospheres that are just absolutely</v>
<v Speaker 3>shithouse sideways.</v>

2249
01:33:38.320 --> 01:33:40.660
<v Speaker 3>And when things go crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you handle,</v>

2250
01:33:40.661 --> 01:33:42.400
<v Speaker 3>how do you manifest it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2251
01:33:42.401 --> 01:33:43.870
<v Speaker 3>what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you doing?</v>

2252
01:33:43.871 --> 01:33:48.370
<v Speaker 3>Are you flipping the fuck out?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you withdrawing?</v>

2253
01:33:49.170 --> 01:33:49.890
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2254
01:33:49.890 --> 01:33:52.030
<v Speaker 3>and we all have different methods for</v>
<v Speaker 3>dealing,</v>

2255
01:33:52.031 --> 01:33:54.910
<v Speaker 3>but I feel like I've kind of gravitated</v>
<v Speaker 3>towards those kinds of people.</v>

2256
01:33:55.210 --> 01:33:55.721
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2257
01:33:55.721 --> 01:33:59.050
<v Speaker 3>I just got done reading Sebastian</v>
<v Speaker 3>Junger's book tribe.</v>

2258
01:33:59.080 --> 01:34:01.270
<v Speaker 3>I just read it to when I got back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Amazing.</v>

2259
01:34:01.300 --> 01:34:03.540
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It reminds you of,</v>

2260
01:34:04.060 --> 01:34:09.060
<v Speaker 3>of where we are and where we've been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and also why people do gravitate towards</v>

2261
01:34:09.551 --> 01:34:13.660
<v Speaker 3>those environments and like what it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they get out of it and how this</v>

2262
01:34:14.050 --> 01:34:17.380
<v Speaker 3>life in these intense environments sort</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

2263
01:34:17.381 --> 01:34:18.080
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2264
01:34:18.080 --> 01:34:23.080
<v Speaker 3>it magnifies so much of what it means to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be human and to be a part of something</v>

2265
01:34:24.701 --> 01:34:27.280
<v Speaker 3>that's bigger than you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the phenomenal thing.</v>

2266
01:34:27.281 --> 01:34:28.960
<v Speaker 3>And I read,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I read a younger,</v>

2267
01:34:29.350 --> 01:34:31.120
<v Speaker 3>I read that book too right when I got</v>
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>

2268
01:34:31.121 --> 01:34:35.560
<v Speaker 3>So just like last month I read it and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>was a great tool for me.</v>

2269
01:34:35.800 --> 01:34:36.460
<v Speaker 3>My,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2270
01:34:36.460 --> 01:34:38.560
<v Speaker 3>my seal team buddy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2271
01:34:38.680 --> 01:34:41.710
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>told me to read it when I got back and</v>

2272
01:34:41.711 --> 01:34:45.220
<v Speaker 3>it says he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the team guys have read it because</v>

2273
01:34:45.221 --> 01:34:46.054
<v Speaker 3>of that.</v>

2274
01:34:46.120 --> 01:34:49.420
<v Speaker 3>It reminds them of why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why,</v>

2275
01:34:49.421 --> 01:34:51.470
<v Speaker 3>and then why things are a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2276
01:34:51.620 --> 01:34:55.180
<v Speaker 3>the threads come undone a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're not in that tribe.</v>

2277
01:34:55.300 --> 01:34:56.200
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2278
01:34:56.230 --> 01:34:56.800
<v Speaker 3>pretty much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2279
01:34:56.800 --> 01:35:00.950
<v Speaker 3>And how many people live in environments</v>
<v Speaker 3>where they don't know their neighbors</v>

2280
01:35:00.990 --> 01:35:02.480
<v Speaker 3>there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no danger,</v>

2281
01:35:02.690 --> 01:35:05.540
<v Speaker 3>there's no excitement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no nothing.</v>

2282
01:35:05.541 --> 01:35:08.480
<v Speaker 3>And they live this muted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>terrifying life.</v>

2283
01:35:08.510 --> 01:35:11.930
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of ways it's terrifying</v>
<v Speaker 3>because there's nothing there.</v>

2284
01:35:11.931 --> 01:35:12.711
<v Speaker 3>It's empty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

2285
01:35:12.711 --> 01:35:15.290
<v Speaker 3>there's a void.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's not how human beings are</v>

2286
01:35:15.291 --> 01:35:17.480
<v Speaker 3>supposed to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're supposed to be confronted by a</v>

2287
01:35:17.481 --> 01:35:20.370
<v Speaker 3>certain amount of difficulty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>supposed to be challenged right now and</v>

2288
01:35:20.380 --> 01:35:23.960
<v Speaker 3>life's very insulated and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and soft.</v>

2289
01:35:24.290 --> 01:35:26.750
<v Speaker 3>And as a result,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we insulate further,</v>

2290
01:35:26.780 --> 01:35:30.530
<v Speaker 3>I think from that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then we medicate to deal with the</v>

2291
01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:33.950
<v Speaker 3>hollow feeling that you get from being</v>
<v Speaker 3>isolated and insulated.</v>

2292
01:35:34.050 --> 01:35:37.100
<v Speaker 3>But then it's the quest is for earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is why people climb Everest while</v>

2293
01:35:37.101 --> 01:35:39.530
<v Speaker 3>you've climbed k two while you go to</v>
<v Speaker 3>push yourself,</v>

2294
01:35:40.130 --> 01:35:40.963
<v Speaker 3>you push yourself.</v>

2295
01:35:40.970 --> 01:35:43.280
<v Speaker 3>Why anybody does that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of the people push himself.</v>

2296
01:35:43.340 --> 01:35:44.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2297
01:35:44.470 --> 01:35:45.111
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2298
01:35:45.111 --> 01:35:47.510
<v Speaker 3>and why w why do we hunt?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2299
01:35:47.570 --> 01:35:49.150
<v Speaker 3>why do we run?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2300
01:35:49.280 --> 01:35:51.230
<v Speaker 3>why did we do the things that we do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause it be,</v>

2301
01:35:51.270 --> 01:35:53.920
<v Speaker 3>it creates engagement for me and no I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>

2302
01:35:53.921 --> 01:35:56.570
<v Speaker 3>I'm not running for my life but creates</v>
<v Speaker 3>struggle.</v>

2303
01:35:57.140 --> 01:35:59.210
<v Speaker 3>I did run for my life just a few months</v>
<v Speaker 3>ago,</v>

2304
01:35:59.240 --> 01:35:59.811
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2305
01:35:59.811 --> 01:36:00.560
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2306
01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:04.160
<v Speaker 3>I look back now and that was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the fucked up thing that I think</v>

2307
01:36:04.161 --> 01:36:06.320
<v Speaker 3>so many military folks really struggle</v>
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>

2308
01:36:06.330 --> 01:36:11.330
<v Speaker 3>And that's what younger talked about in</v>
<v Speaker 3>that book was how would you find the,</v>

2309
01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:16.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the environment you were in was so</v>

2310
01:36:17.330 --> 01:36:21.830
<v Speaker 3>precarious and it was just so tenuous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it could be wiped out in any second</v>

2311
01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:25.250
<v Speaker 3>and yet you want to go back there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2312
01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:27.800
<v Speaker 3>I got my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got an avalanche on that mountain,</v>

2313
01:36:28.220 --> 01:36:29.150
<v Speaker 3>almost dead.</v>

2314
01:36:29.480 --> 01:36:31.420
<v Speaker 3>It turns out I want to go back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why,</v>

2315
01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:32.301
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what,</v>

2316
01:36:32.301 --> 01:36:33.800
<v Speaker 3>why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is that,</v>

2317
01:36:33.830 --> 01:36:36.480
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that wiring that that makes you want,</v>

2318
01:36:36.770 --> 01:36:39.500
<v Speaker 3>but you know why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because they want to be with their boys</v>

2319
01:36:39.501 --> 01:36:41.000
<v Speaker 3>and their gauss and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2320
01:36:41.030 --> 01:36:43.250
<v Speaker 3>in it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in it connected feeling like,</v>

2321
01:36:43.280 --> 01:36:45.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our shit is tied together.</v>

2322
01:36:46.100 --> 01:36:47.300
<v Speaker 3>Why do I want to go back in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>mountains?</v>

2323
01:36:47.301 --> 01:36:51.440
<v Speaker 3>It's same reason cause I want to go with</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same boys and get the same sort of,</v>

2324
01:36:51.470 --> 01:36:53.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>intense experience.</v>

2325
01:36:53.391 --> 01:36:56.630
<v Speaker 3>And I think that we missed that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I missed that.</v>

2326
01:36:57.140 --> 01:36:59.540
<v Speaker 3>I really like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jeff's got the thing he wanted to teach</v>

2327
01:36:59.541 --> 01:37:00.910
<v Speaker 3>his son and when we're up there in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everest,</v>

2328
01:37:00.920 --> 01:37:03.830
<v Speaker 3>he kept on talking about teaching his</v>
<v Speaker 3>son to serve others,</v>

2329
01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:07.220
<v Speaker 3>phoebe positive or a role model and</v>
<v Speaker 3>serve others.</v>

2330
01:37:07.310 --> 01:37:08.720
<v Speaker 3>And I don't know where that comes from</v>
<v Speaker 3>him,</v>

2331
01:37:08.721 --> 01:37:10.070
<v Speaker 3>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what he always talks about.</v>

2332
01:37:10.160 --> 01:37:11.330
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it started with Eric,</v>

2333
01:37:11.331 --> 01:37:12.770
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because that was the foundation of my</v>

2334
01:37:12.771 --> 01:37:14.630
<v Speaker 3>relationship with this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with my blonde buddy.</v>

2335
01:37:15.560 --> 01:37:18.290
<v Speaker 3>I was a selfish dirt bag climber in j</v>
<v Speaker 3>tree,</v>

2336
01:37:18.350 --> 01:37:19.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>

2337
01:37:19.790 --> 01:37:24.710
<v Speaker 3>in the mid nineties and I met this blind</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude who needed an ally.</v>

2338
01:37:25.220 --> 01:37:27.920
<v Speaker 3>He needed a friend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he needed a guide and he did not just a</v>

2339
01:37:27.921 --> 01:37:28.840
<v Speaker 3>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he needed,</v>

2340
01:37:28.841 --> 01:37:31.850
<v Speaker 3>as he did a teammate and not somebody</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would,</v>

2341
01:37:32.300 --> 01:37:34.730
<v Speaker 3>that he could trust,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but somebody that would eventually trust</v>

2342
01:37:34.731 --> 01:37:36.530
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's pretty,</v>

2343
01:37:36.890 --> 01:37:41.890
<v Speaker 3>Dow's pretty wild for him to ask at some</v>
<v Speaker 3>point for a sighted person to trust a</v>

2344
01:37:43.881 --> 01:37:48.070
<v Speaker 3>blind person on the side of a rock face</v>
<v Speaker 3>or the side of a mountain because you</v>

2345
01:37:48.071 --> 01:37:50.330
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard enough with everything and you</v>

2346
01:37:50.331 --> 01:37:52.640
<v Speaker 3>take away your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your vision and you know,</v>

2347
01:37:52.641 --> 01:37:55.370
<v Speaker 3>Shit just gets amplified.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Eric's pretty famous and he's,</v>

2348
01:37:55.400 --> 01:37:56.490
<v Speaker 3>he's summited,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does it,</v>

2349
01:37:56.491 --> 01:37:57.324
<v Speaker 3>what does he summited?</v>

2350
01:37:57.450 --> 01:37:58.590
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's done the seven summit,</v>

2351
01:37:58.591 --> 01:38:00.300
<v Speaker 3>so the highest point and each of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>seven continents.</v>

2352
01:38:00.301 --> 01:38:03.690
<v Speaker 3>I was on six of them with him and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>went down to an article while I was in</v>

2353
01:38:03.691 --> 01:38:05.220
<v Speaker 3>medical school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2354
01:38:05.221 --> 01:38:06.210
<v Speaker 3>but then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2355
01:38:06.240 --> 01:38:07.950
<v Speaker 3>he's gone on to do a lot of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a,</v>

2356
01:38:08.010 --> 01:38:09.180
<v Speaker 3>he's a bad dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2357
01:38:09.200 --> 01:38:10.680
<v Speaker 3>He's a speaker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2358
01:38:10.681 --> 01:38:12.510
<v Speaker 3>he's a great dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eric Wimer.</v>

2359
01:38:12.630 --> 01:38:14.250
<v Speaker 3>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but to be honest with you,</v>

2360
01:38:14.251 --> 01:38:15.630
<v Speaker 3>he'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'd be the first to tell you that</v>

2361
01:38:15.631 --> 01:38:18.510
<v Speaker 3>kayaking in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a boat by himself down the Grand</v>

2362
01:38:18.511 --> 01:38:22.650
<v Speaker 3>Canyon was way scarier than anything</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's ever done.</v>

2363
01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:24.080
<v Speaker 3>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Could you,</v>

2364
01:38:24.081 --> 01:38:27.090
<v Speaker 3>you don't know what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's the violence and talking about</v>

2365
01:38:27.091 --> 01:38:31.290
<v Speaker 3>chaotic environment around you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just you carefully here,</v>

2366
01:38:31.291 --> 01:38:33.750
<v Speaker 3>the dude and your ear and sometimes not</v>
<v Speaker 3>at all.</v>

2367
01:38:34.170 --> 01:38:37.800
<v Speaker 3>All you can hear is this violence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And somehow he just paddled through and</v>

2368
01:38:37.801 --> 01:38:38.400
<v Speaker 3>then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2369
01:38:38.400 --> 01:38:40.770
<v Speaker 3>he'll get tossed and go under and have</v>
<v Speaker 3>to roll back up.</v>

2370
01:38:40.770 --> 01:38:42.150
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

2371
01:38:42.450 --> 01:38:43.960
<v Speaker 3>he tells me that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2372
01:38:43.980 --> 01:38:46.800
<v Speaker 3>he had his own little version of ptsd</v>
<v Speaker 3>from that,</v>

2373
01:38:46.801 --> 01:38:49.950
<v Speaker 3>from just being freaked the fuck out and</v>
<v Speaker 3>having nightmares.</v>

2374
01:38:50.100 --> 01:38:53.100
<v Speaker 3>How long was that travel?</v>
<v Speaker 3>200 and something miles on that tank.</v>

2375

<v Speaker 3>Something like that.</v>

2377
01:38:56.521 --> 01:38:59.730
<v Speaker 3>I think it was pretty remarkable and</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty remarkable.</v>

01:38:59.760 --> 01:39:00.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>but yet it does.</v>

2381
01:39:04.591 --> 01:39:06.330
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is a reoccurring theme.</v>

<v Speaker 3>back,</v>

2385
01:39:12.810 --> 01:39:14.790

<v Speaker 3>So wine is what he does in the mountain</v>

2402
01:39:38.281 --> 01:39:40.860
<v Speaker 3>sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then mayor of the city.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Well that's an old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's an old woman.</v>

<v Speaker 3>She's got hair right there.</v>

<v Speaker 3>a that he could figure out how to</v>

2416
01:40:10.291 --> 01:40:13.170
<v Speaker 3>balance that and figure out how to go</v>
<v Speaker 3>left and go,</v>

2417
01:40:13.171 --> 01:40:14.100
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2418
01:40:14.250 --> 01:40:16.770
<v Speaker 3>he's an amazing athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first and foremost.</v>

2419
01:40:16.770 --> 01:40:18.150
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if he was cited,</v>

2420
01:40:18.151 --> 01:40:20.430
<v Speaker 3>he could been like a pro ball player.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2421
01:40:20.431 --> 01:40:23.250
<v Speaker 3>he's just got that sort of body</v>
<v Speaker 3>awareness.</v>

2422
01:40:23.700 --> 01:40:25.920
<v Speaker 3>And then until he was born with a</v>
<v Speaker 3>degenerate retina disease,</v>

2423
01:40:25.921 --> 01:40:29.220
<v Speaker 3>so he was those under,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was blind,</v>

2424
01:40:29.700 --> 01:40:32.760
<v Speaker 3>legally blind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then his retinas unraveled and at</v>

2425
01:40:32.761 --> 01:40:35.130
<v Speaker 3>the age of 13,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was totally lights out.</v>

2426
01:40:35.520 --> 01:40:38.670
<v Speaker 3>And then his mama got killed in a car</v>
<v Speaker 3>wreck two years later.</v>

2427
01:40:39.090 --> 01:40:40.530
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so he,</v>

2428
01:40:40.590 --> 01:40:41.460
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

2429
01:40:41.640 --> 01:40:44.280
<v Speaker 3>it was step up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fortunately for him,</v>

2430
01:40:44.281 --> 01:40:45.900
<v Speaker 3>his dad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2431
01:40:46.200 --> 01:40:51.200
<v Speaker 3>his was a marine fighter pilot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ed and Ed was not about to let his blind</v>

2432
01:40:53.020 --> 01:40:56.980
<v Speaker 3>son sit back and let life go by.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he grabbed him by the scuff of the</v>

2433
01:40:56.981 --> 01:40:59.380
<v Speaker 3>neck and took him on all these are all</v>
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

2434
01:40:59.410 --> 01:41:00.243
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2435
01:41:00.910 --> 01:41:03.040
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>around the world as he got stationed in</v>

2436
01:41:03.041 --> 01:41:04.060
<v Speaker 3>different places.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2437
01:41:04.540 --> 01:41:05.373
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2438
01:41:05.710 --> 01:41:10.390
<v Speaker 3>and Eric just realize like pony up and</v>
<v Speaker 3>no time to feel and got Tom for sitting</v>

2439
01:41:10.391 --> 01:41:12.070
<v Speaker 3>around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>son get up.</v>

2440
01:41:12.520 --> 01:41:15.790
<v Speaker 3>And he did and he found rock climbing</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then rock climbing turned into</v>

2441
01:41:15.791 --> 01:41:17.050
<v Speaker 3>mountaineering.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's when we met</v>

2442
01:41:18.730 --> 01:41:21.010
<v Speaker 3>23 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>23,</v>

2443
01:41:21.011 --> 01:41:23.950
<v Speaker 3>four years ago now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think this is all very hard for some</v>

2444
01:41:23.951 --> 01:41:26.140
<v Speaker 3>people to process,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially people that haven't</v>

2445
01:41:26.141 --> 01:41:30.520
<v Speaker 3>experienced very difficult things are</v>
<v Speaker 3>very scary things or dangerous things.</v>

2446
01:41:30.580 --> 01:41:31.540
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that this,</v>

2447
01:41:31.541 --> 01:41:36.541
<v Speaker 3>that people would long to do this to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>a blind guy who's going through 270 plus</v>

2448
01:41:37.781 --> 01:41:41.740
<v Speaker 3>miles of water in a kayak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or to be someone who wants a summit</v>

2449
01:41:41.741 --> 01:41:45.970
<v Speaker 3>Mount Everest or to be someone who wants</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be a medic in a war zone or to be</v>

2450
01:41:45.971 --> 01:41:48.200
<v Speaker 3>Sebastian younger who was out there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

2451
01:41:48.520 --> 01:41:49.660
<v Speaker 3>embedded,</v>
<v Speaker 3>embedded.</v>

2452
01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:50.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For years,</v>

2453
01:41:50.710 --> 01:41:51.850
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Years.</v>

2454
01:41:52.180 --> 01:41:54.820
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think that maybe the general</v>

2455
01:41:54.821 --> 01:41:59.110
<v Speaker 3>population might look at that and feel</v>
<v Speaker 3>like maybe it's reckless or some are</v>

2456
01:41:59.111 --> 01:42:00.660
<v Speaker 3>super inspired and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pan,</v>

2457
01:42:00.661 --> 01:42:01.494
<v Speaker 3>it's so great.</v>

2458
01:42:01.630 --> 01:42:02.860
<v Speaker 3>And then others are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2459
01:42:02.861 --> 01:42:04.030
<v Speaker 3>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

2460
01:42:04.150 --> 01:42:04.990
<v Speaker 3>I'm down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>

2461
01:42:04.991 --> 01:42:08.890
<v Speaker 3>I'm psyched that you're out there</v>
<v Speaker 3>charging because then that sets the</v>

2462
01:42:08.891 --> 01:42:11.630
<v Speaker 3>template and what it does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think for a lot of people that just</v>

2463
01:42:11.631 --> 01:42:15.820
<v Speaker 3>says all that bond guy can do it well</v>
<v Speaker 3>then that means I should stop feeling</v>

2464
01:42:15.821 --> 01:42:18.430
<v Speaker 3>sorry for myself cause I'm feeling low</v>
<v Speaker 3>today.</v>

2465
01:42:18.610 --> 01:42:21.670
<v Speaker 3>There's their guarantee you there was a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of times when I don't feel like</v>

2466
01:42:21.671 --> 01:42:23.920
<v Speaker 3>training,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't really feel like going out and</v>

2467
01:42:23.921 --> 01:42:28.921
<v Speaker 3>doing something hard and then I'll think</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need to train harder to be strong</v>

2468
01:42:30.340 --> 01:42:34.240
<v Speaker 3>enough that when shit goes sideways I'll</v>
<v Speaker 3>have his back.</v>

2469
01:42:34.690 --> 01:42:36.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know when you do train for something</v>

2470
01:42:36.311 --> 01:42:38.500
<v Speaker 3>like Everest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you prepare for something like</v>

2471
01:42:38.501 --> 01:42:39.490
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Climb.</v>

2472
01:42:39.700 --> 01:42:41.710
<v Speaker 3>Just climb up and down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>up and down.</v>

2473
01:42:41.740 --> 01:42:44.500
<v Speaker 3>Lots of weight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a place like you know you go to</v>

2474
01:42:44.501 --> 01:42:47.580
<v Speaker 3>boulder or somewhere in the mountains</v>
<v Speaker 3>above it or yeah,</v>

2475
01:42:47.590 --> 01:42:50.260
<v Speaker 3>like way up in the hills and like big</v>
<v Speaker 3>long days,</v>

<v Speaker 3>doing it the whole deal.</v>

2486
01:43:09.850 --> 01:43:13.450
<v Speaker 3>Those days of carrying big heavyweight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've kind of stopped doing that and I</v>

2487
01:43:13.451 --> 01:43:15.000
<v Speaker 3>just go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2488

<v Speaker 3>because I like to feel a little bit more</v>
<v Speaker 3>free.</v>

2489
01:43:17.170 --> 01:43:19.570
<v Speaker 3>There was a time when I would put on a</v>
<v Speaker 3>big pack,</v>

2490
01:43:19.980 --> 01:43:21.040
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2496
01:43:32.051 --> 01:43:33.400
<v Speaker 3>pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is not much at all.</v>

2497
01:43:33.430 --> 01:43:35.620
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a lot when you start walking up</v>

2498
01:43:35.621 --> 01:43:37.510
<v Speaker 3>hills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2499
01:43:38.010 --> 01:43:40.300
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of these guys are probably carrying</v>

2500
01:43:40.360 --> 01:43:41.380
<v Speaker 3>way more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

<v Speaker 3>guide.</v>

2503
01:43:47.500 --> 01:43:50.440
<v Speaker 3>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The clients would typically have,</v>

2510
01:44:03.860 --> 01:44:06.710
<v Speaker 3>pretty narrow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How the fuck are they carrying that much</v>

2511
01:44:06.711 --> 01:44:08.630
<v Speaker 3>weight?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I carried that much weight for years and</v>

2512
01:44:08.631 --> 01:44:11.510
<v Speaker 3>years and I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was a buck shifty back then,</v>

2513
01:44:11.540 --> 01:44:12.373
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2517
01:44:20.420 --> 01:44:22.310
<v Speaker 3>when you really move and luck on that</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of mountain,</v>

2518
01:44:22.311 --> 01:44:23.120
<v Speaker 3>it's a slog.</v>

2519
01:44:23.120 --> 01:44:25.670
<v Speaker 3>It's really slow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you've got a technical</v>

2520
01:44:25.671 --> 01:44:27.050
<v Speaker 3>training.</v>

<v Speaker 3>pounds make paint.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You gotta you got to feel like someone</v>

2526
01:44:38.211 --> 01:44:39.950

01:44:45.260 --> 01:44:46.820
<v Speaker 3>lower back and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh man,</v>

2531
01:44:47.800 --> 01:44:49.220
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't do it now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2532
01:44:49.221 --> 01:44:50.270
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just,</v>

2533
01:44:50.690 --> 01:44:52.760
<v Speaker 3>I get sore thinking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean,</v>

2534
01:44:52.761 --> 01:44:56.330
<v Speaker 3>this was back in my twenties when I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing yell back to back Denali trips and</v>

2535
01:44:56.331 --> 01:44:57.860
<v Speaker 3>he didn't know any better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know any better.</v>

2536
01:44:57.861 --> 01:44:58.970
<v Speaker 3>And it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is fun.</v>

2537
01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:00.380
<v Speaker 3>It was fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was cool.</v>

2538
01:45:00.381 --> 01:45:03.410
<v Speaker 3>I used to do a lot of expeditions</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I was the quintessential dirt</v>

2539
01:45:03.411 --> 01:45:05.810
<v Speaker 3>bag just so I could go eat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2540
01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:07.910
<v Speaker 3>so I could get fed and I didn't even</v>
<v Speaker 3>care.</v>

2541
01:45:07.910 --> 01:45:09.080
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would have done it for free on</v>

2542
01:45:09.081 --> 01:45:11.440
<v Speaker 3>expeditions just so you can get some</v>
<v Speaker 3>clues just to eat,</v>

2543
01:45:11.441 --> 01:45:13.610
<v Speaker 3>to know I was going to eat some dee dee</v>
<v Speaker 3>hydrated food.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I grew up in.</v>

2547

<v Speaker 3>I was born in North Carolina,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2548
01:45:25.220 --> 01:45:27.590
<v Speaker 3>in the smokies and I grew up in Roanoke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Virginia.</v>

2549
01:45:28.060 --> 01:45:31.070
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2550
01:45:31.071 --> 01:45:31.904
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2551
01:45:31.970 --> 01:45:35.330
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my dad and mom were both just working,</v>

<v Speaker 3>hard working middle class folks.</v>

2554
01:45:39.890 --> 01:45:41.750
<v Speaker 3>And I was just a restless punk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2555
01:45:41.751 --> 01:45:44.480
<v Speaker 3>I was just super restless,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting in trouble all the time.</v>

2556
01:45:44.481 --> 01:45:46.040
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2557
01:45:46.041 --> 01:45:49.640
<v Speaker 3>I got arrested several times before I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was 18 and just bad,</v>

2558
01:45:49.641 --> 01:45:53.210
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just restless and dumb like most of us I</v>

2559
01:45:53.211 --> 01:45:55.500
<v Speaker 3>think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And went to school at,</v>

2560
01:45:55.640 --> 01:46:00.640
<v Speaker 3>at Tennessee for a year and got a 1.2 my</v>
<v Speaker 3>first semester and a 0.6.</v>

2561
01:46:01.820 --> 01:46:04.300
<v Speaker 3>It's possible to get a 0.6.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2562
01:46:04.340 --> 01:46:05.830
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a d in racket ball.</v>

2563
01:46:06.380 --> 01:46:09.610
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no three store.</v>

2564
01:46:10.010 --> 01:46:11.900
<v Speaker 3>You just weren't paying attention?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2565
01:46:11.901 --> 01:46:15.410
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was drinking brown liquor and chasing</v>

2566
01:46:15.411 --> 01:46:19.250
<v Speaker 3>women and I was good at it.</v>

2567
01:46:21.390 --> 01:46:24.650
<v Speaker 3>A bit of both those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I failed out and then,</v>

2568
01:46:24.770 --> 01:46:29.770
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>moved to Colorado in 1989 and uh,</v>

2569
01:46:30.380 --> 01:46:33.620
<v Speaker 3>moved to boulder and it's just a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 3>of hippies and like I was into the</v>

2570
01:46:33.621 --> 01:46:35.810
<v Speaker 3>grateful dead and I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2571
01:46:36.170 --> 01:46:39.770
<v Speaker 3>tapping into some good fun things and</v>
<v Speaker 3>grow in my head.</v>

2572
01:46:39.771 --> 01:46:42.590
<v Speaker 3>And I fell in with a group of climbers</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty,</v>

2573
01:46:42.920 --> 01:46:45.260
<v Speaker 3>pretty quick off who are a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 3>years older than me,</v>

2574
01:46:45.261 --> 01:46:48.650
<v Speaker 3>and they basically took me under their</v>
<v Speaker 3>wing and sort of gave me this</v>

2575
01:46:48.660 --> 01:46:51.420
<v Speaker 3>apprenticeship and taught me how to</v>
<v Speaker 3>knock it dead.</v>

2576
01:46:51.840 --> 01:46:52.680
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2577
01:46:52.760 --> 01:46:54.900
<v Speaker 3>Boulder's a real weird spot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2578
01:46:54.920 --> 01:46:59.550
<v Speaker 3>This is like fly fishing there and</v>
<v Speaker 3>kayaking and hikers and everyone's</v>

2579
01:46:59.551 --> 01:47:01.680
<v Speaker 3>riding mountain bikes and everyone's</v>
<v Speaker 3>fit.</v>

2580
01:47:02.010 --> 01:47:04.080
<v Speaker 3>It's weird because where's the fat</v>
<v Speaker 3>people?</v>

2581
01:47:04.260 --> 01:47:06.390
<v Speaker 3>There's no fat people in boom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so weird.</v>

2582
01:47:06.970 --> 01:47:09.660
<v Speaker 3>You walk around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody's got like Solomon's on and</v>

2583
01:47:09.661 --> 01:47:11.850
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like everybody's coming in from a</v>

2584
01:47:11.851 --> 01:47:12.730
<v Speaker 3>workout.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Whole foods.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just everybody stinky and find some</v>

2586
01:47:15.901 --> 01:47:19.380

<v Speaker 3>Neural Sinewy and shit ranchers.</v>

2587
01:47:19.440 --> 01:47:21.420
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I just,</v>

2588
01:47:21.450 --> 01:47:23.220
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've lived in Boulder on and off for 28</v>

2589
01:47:23.221 --> 01:47:25.750
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went to medical school in Philadelphia</v>

2590
01:47:25.751 --> 01:47:27.690
<v Speaker 3>at Drexel Medical College,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pennsylvania.</v>

2591
01:47:27.720 --> 01:47:29.820
<v Speaker 3>Other than that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been in and out of boulder for 28</v>

2592
01:47:29.821 --> 01:47:31.320
<v Speaker 3>years and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2593
01:47:31.321 --> 01:47:32.640
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're moving to evergreen.</v>

2594
01:47:32.740 --> 01:47:33.810
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're moving to evergreen,</v>

2595
01:47:33.811 --> 01:47:36.210
<v Speaker 3>Colorado,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a super sweet spot,</v>

2596
01:47:36.240 --> 01:47:39.360
<v Speaker 3>but that's the reason I'm leaving</v>
<v Speaker 3>boulders because it's just,</v>

2597
01:47:39.361 --> 01:47:40.650
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty congested,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2598
01:47:40.740 --> 01:47:41.573
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people,</v>

2599
01:47:41.780 --> 01:47:42.613
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>areas.</v>

2600
01:47:42.620 --> 01:47:45.620
<v Speaker 1>Lot of people live there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now I'm riding on the four oh five</v>

2601
01:47:45.621 --> 01:47:47.720
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>200,000 people.</v>

2602
01:47:48.620 --> 01:47:50.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how y'all do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the people I was talking to</v>

2603
01:47:50.931 --> 01:47:52.460
<v Speaker 1>alumni,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was saying that she's going to bring</v>

2604
01:47:52.461 --> 01:47:56.120
<v Speaker 1>her nieces to California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd never been outside of Maui.</v>

2605
01:47:56.690 --> 01:47:58.820
<v Speaker 1>They'd been a Lanai and Maui.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

2606
01:47:58.821 --> 01:48:00.680
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they haven't even been to fucking</v>

2607
01:48:00.681 --> 01:48:04.610
<v Speaker 1>Honolulu and now she's going to fly him</v>
<v Speaker 1>to Los Angeles.</v>

2608
01:48:04.611 --> 01:48:08.880
<v Speaker 1>They're going to go to Disneyland or</v>
<v Speaker 1>universal like what in the fuck she gave</v>

2609
01:48:08.881 --> 01:48:10.190
<v Speaker 1>him some mushroom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See what happens.</v>

2610
01:48:11.180 --> 01:48:12.830
<v Speaker 1>Just don't need to that to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>overloaded.</v>

2611
01:48:12.890 --> 01:48:17.330
<v Speaker 1>I remember when I was a kid and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we went from a New York too,</v>

2612
01:48:17.331 --> 01:48:20.020
<v Speaker 1>or from Boston rather than in New York</v>
<v Speaker 1>for uh,</v>

2613
01:48:20.030 --> 01:48:20.900
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2614
01:48:20.990 --> 01:48:23.030
<v Speaker 1>I think it was for a karate tournament</v>
<v Speaker 1>or something like that.</v>

2615
01:48:23.031 --> 01:48:26.960
<v Speaker 1>But we were driving up the west side</v>
<v Speaker 1>highway and you see the city looming in</v>

2616
01:48:26.961 --> 01:48:28.910
<v Speaker 1>the distance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the death star.</v>

2617
01:48:29.390 --> 01:48:32.300
<v Speaker 1>And I remember thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what in the fuck is this?</v>

2618
01:48:32.301 --> 01:48:34.790
<v Speaker 1>Like how are there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to so many bills.</v>

2619
01:48:35.060 --> 01:48:37.640
<v Speaker 1>Boston's a city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not that kind of city.</v>

2620
01:48:37.670 --> 01:48:38.780
<v Speaker 1>It's not Manhattan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2621
01:48:38.830 --> 01:48:39.680
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Manhattan.</v>

2622
01:48:39.681 --> 01:48:41.860
<v Speaker 1>It's something very unique and special</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

2623
01:48:42.260 --> 01:48:43.340
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you pull up to it,</v>

2624
01:48:43.341 --> 01:48:45.050
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is this?</v>

2625
01:48:45.051 --> 01:48:46.220
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was so fun.</v>

2626
01:48:46.320 --> 01:48:48.090
<v Speaker 3>Intimidated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that could go either way for those</v>

2627
01:48:48.091 --> 01:48:48.860
<v Speaker 3>kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right there.</v>

2628
01:48:48.860 --> 01:48:53.860
<v Speaker 3>Can't just be fascinated by the energy</v>
<v Speaker 3>or bug the fuck out and you know,</v>

2629
01:48:54.400 --> 01:48:57.420
<v Speaker 3>can't wait to get back to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And all this amount of stimuli that you</v>

2630
01:48:57.421 --> 01:49:00.180
<v Speaker 3>get in an environment like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just overwhelming.</v>

2631
01:49:00.720 --> 01:49:02.210
<v Speaker 3>But you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boulders too much.</v>

2632
01:49:02.211 --> 01:49:05.820
<v Speaker 3>It's too much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Too many people now there's almost a</v>

2633
01:49:05.820 --> 01:49:07.440
<v Speaker 3>hundred thousand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well do this any longer.</v>

2634
01:49:07.441 --> 01:49:09.990
<v Speaker 3>I don't like to sit in my truck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like to move,</v>

2635
01:49:09.991 --> 01:49:11.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I'm going to go drive somewhere,</v>

<v Speaker 3>get out and go in and do my deal and</v>

2637

<v Speaker 3>come back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

2638
01:49:16.321 --> 01:49:17.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the trails are pretty,</v>

2639

<v Speaker 3>pretty populated to you go climbing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got to wait in line.</v>

2640
01:49:22.640 --> 01:49:25.470
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and sometimes you gotta go up like,</v>

2641

2643
01:49:32.910 --> 01:49:35.550
<v Speaker 3>That's a lot of people getting busy out</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the woods,</v>

2644
01:49:35.580 --> 01:49:38.040
<v Speaker 3>which is cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

2645
01:49:38.280 --> 01:49:39.960
<v Speaker 3>I'm just feeling like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2646
01:49:39.990 --> 01:49:41.240
<v Speaker 3>it was a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of folks,</v>

2647
01:49:41.241 --> 01:49:44.690
<v Speaker 3>it turns out the older I get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the less people he wants to talk to you</v>

2648

<v Speaker 3>soon.</v>

2649
01:49:45.150 --> 01:49:46.370
<v Speaker 1>I think also that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2650
01:49:46.371 --> 01:49:51.371
<v Speaker 1>you're involved these intense situations</v>
<v Speaker 1>like being in Iraq or like being on ever</v>

2651
01:49:51.461 --> 01:49:53.050
<v Speaker 1>since.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you just want to sit back and</v>

2652
01:49:53.051 --> 01:49:54.360
<v Speaker 1>process it all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2653
01:49:54.450 --> 01:49:56.620
<v Speaker 1>It would sit on the rocking chair and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>liked to,</v>

2654
01:49:56.680 --> 01:49:58.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to mow my yard.</v>

2655
01:49:58.301 --> 01:50:00.830
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or I want to drive my tractor around and</v>

2656
01:50:01.810 --> 01:50:03.130
<v Speaker 1>sip on a beer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a,</v>

2657
01:50:03.250 --> 01:50:06.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm a southern boy at heart and I like</v>
<v Speaker 1>quiet things.</v>

2658
01:50:06.550 --> 01:50:09.400
<v Speaker 1>I know a bunch of guys who've moved out</v>
<v Speaker 1>there for that very reason.</v>

2659
01:50:09.430 --> 01:50:11.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense.</v>

2660
01:50:11.170 --> 01:50:13.150
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're moving there here in a couple</v>

2661
01:50:13.150 --> 01:50:13.770
<v Speaker 1>of weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>

<v Speaker 1>prettier.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beautiful.</v>

2664
01:50:17.380 --> 01:50:20.260
<v Speaker 1>It's real nice how the winters are</v>
<v Speaker 1>brutal.</v>

2665
01:50:20.820 --> 01:50:22.520
<v Speaker 1>They ain't gold hill winters though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2666
01:50:22.750 --> 01:50:23.583
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

2667
01:50:23.650 --> 01:50:25.630
<v Speaker 1>that's way worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's brutal,</v>

2668
01:50:25.710 --> 01:50:26.380
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2669
01:50:26.380 --> 01:50:27.270
<v Speaker 1>it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gotta read.</v>

2670
01:50:27.310 --> 01:50:28.300
<v Speaker 1>You gotta get ready.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2671
01:50:28.301 --> 01:50:30.130
<v Speaker 1>we live on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we live on a dirt road.</v>

2672
01:50:30.250 --> 01:50:32.320
<v Speaker 1>Holla out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

2673
01:50:32.350 --> 01:50:34.510
<v Speaker 1>I pulled up the Joe's house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an old power wagon,</v>

2674
01:50:34.511 --> 01:50:37.510
<v Speaker 1>his old house in Boulder and old power</v>
<v Speaker 1>wagon with a snow plow and there's a</v>

2675
01:50:37.511 --> 01:50:39.760
<v Speaker 1>couple of snow machines down there and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pulling my,</v>

2676
01:50:40.350 --> 01:50:42.100
<v Speaker 1>do you know why those things are there</v>
<v Speaker 1>joe?</v>

2677
01:50:42.200 --> 01:50:45.720
<v Speaker 1>Cause you've got to pour yourself out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No Snowman.</v>

2678
01:50:45.880 --> 01:50:47.320
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I lived in Boston,</v>

2679
01:50:47.350 --> 01:50:51.310
<v Speaker 1>I drove a van.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I drove a delivered newspapers.</v>

2680
01:50:51.610 --> 01:50:56.020
<v Speaker 1>I drove 365 days a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I drove every fucking day.</v>

2681
01:50:56.050 --> 01:50:58.390
<v Speaker 1>Every time a blizzard hit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every time snow hit,</v>

2682
01:50:58.810 --> 01:51:00.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm not scarce now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know how to drive in snow.</v>

2683
01:51:01.240 --> 01:51:03.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's not fun to get stuck and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>will get stuck,</v>

2684
01:51:04.120 --> 01:51:06.340
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't bother me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't freak me out.</v>

2685
01:51:06.370 --> 01:51:08.710
<v Speaker 1>But to someone who's never been in snow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2686
01:51:08.920 --> 01:51:10.270
<v Speaker 1>it ain't the place to play.</v>

2687
01:51:10.450 --> 01:51:12.610
<v Speaker 1>But if you had to choose between,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's,</v>

2688
01:51:12.611 --> 01:51:14.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a tough call because like would you</v>

2689
01:51:14.501 --> 01:51:19.350
<v Speaker 1>rather live in like Phoenix right now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard it's 124 degrees that they're</v>

2690
01:51:19.360 --> 01:51:23.050
<v Speaker 1>canceling flights because it's so hot</v>
<v Speaker 1>that canceling flights.</v>

2691
01:51:23.080 --> 01:51:23.913
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2692
01:51:24.160 --> 01:51:29.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't do something about that</v>
<v Speaker 1>cold and snow too.</v>

2693
01:51:29.111 --> 01:51:31.990
<v Speaker 1>That's like really peaceful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's something that people don't</v>

2694
01:51:31.991 --> 01:51:33.280
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember when I was a kid,</v>

2695
01:51:33.550 --> 01:51:36.580
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that I really liked</v>
<v Speaker 1>about snow is a special,</v>

2696
01:51:36.581 --> 01:51:39.460
<v Speaker 1>when I had to deliver newspapers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like I would have to be out there</v>

2697
01:51:39.760 --> 01:51:44.760
<v Speaker 1>and you would hear nothing because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>snow muffles all the sound.</v>

2698
01:51:45.370 --> 01:51:48.160
<v Speaker 1>So it's like you get a kind of peace and</v>
<v Speaker 1>quiet that you don't,</v>

2699
01:51:48.280 --> 01:51:49.750
<v Speaker 1>no one's driving cause it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2700
01:51:49.751 --> 01:51:52.510
<v Speaker 1>there's two feet of snow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you were out there and it's just</v>

2701
01:51:53.750 --> 01:51:56.730
<v Speaker 1>nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing and everything soft and you hit</v>

2702
01:51:56.731 --> 01:51:57.850
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch,</v>

2703
01:51:57.970 --> 01:52:00.160
<v Speaker 1>watch for of your feet on the ground and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

2704
01:52:00.720 --> 01:52:02.200
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you,</v>

2705
01:52:02.740 --> 01:52:06.880
<v Speaker 1>and then I think people that live in</v>
<v Speaker 1>those environments like live in the</v>

2706
01:52:06.881 --> 01:52:10.210
<v Speaker 1>cold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll appreciate summer for real.</v>
