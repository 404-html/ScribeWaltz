<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

14
00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.400
<v Speaker 1>you're going to learn something about me</v>
<v Speaker 1>not standard swell.</v>

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

16
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.870
<v Speaker 1>Sketchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

17
00:00:39.871 --> 00:00:40.704
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am talking before this podcast about </v>

18
00:00:42.031 --> 00:00:43.860
<v Speaker 1>someone stealing your twitter handle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

19
00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.360
<v Speaker 1>I inadvertently posted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

20
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.060
<v Speaker 1>at Wayne Fetterman and I thought it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>you because when you go to it,</v>

21
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.560
<v Speaker 1>it had that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks like they had it.</v>

22
00:00:52.561 --> 00:00:54.420
<v Speaker 1>So how'd this guy steal it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

23
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.000
<v Speaker 1>So he stole your password somehow.</v>

24
00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:56.880
<v Speaker 1>Somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

25
00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.180
<v Speaker 1>that's the scariest part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how does twitter not respond to that?</v>

26
00:01:00.181 --> 00:01:01.014
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried to go through twitter and he </v>

27
00:01:03.151 --> 00:01:03.990
<v Speaker 1>wrote me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>

28
00:01:03.991 --> 00:01:04.824
<v Speaker 1>oh don't you remember we?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he just told a story that </v>

29
00:01:07.621 --> 00:01:11.940
<v Speaker 1>didn't happen about a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember.</v>

30
00:01:11.941 --> 00:01:14.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean I have it on here if you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>look it up.</v>

31
00:01:14.011 --> 00:01:14.844
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was just like I don't want </v>

32
00:01:15.961 --> 00:01:17.880
<v Speaker 1>anything to do with this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy's a liar.</v>

33
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.273
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now this is the first time I ever </v>

34
00:01:20.431 --> 00:01:24.570
<v Speaker 1>talked about it cause I'm more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause he has obviously access to my best</v>

35
00:01:24.571 --> 00:01:26.160
<v Speaker 1>word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

36
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.610

<v Speaker 1>so your past what?</v>

37
00:01:27.611 --> 00:01:30.690

<v Speaker 1>which is my main one.</v>

38
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:31.890
<v Speaker 1>Am I talking too loud?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

39
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.360
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a,</v>

40
00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.080
<v Speaker 1>I get excited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

<v Speaker 1>well that's something to be excited </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

42
00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's your fucking name and </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone stole it.</v>

43
00:01:42.211 --> 00:01:43.044
<v Speaker 1>I had a fetterman and I had at Wayne,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wayne Fetterman had them both and one </v>

44
00:01:46.861 --> 00:01:47.694
<v Speaker 1>was just going to be to put people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>add fetterman cause I liked that one a </v>

45
00:01:50.461 --> 00:01:51.900
<v Speaker 1>little better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you like that one better?</v>

46
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.380
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are already good.</v>

47
00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:56.383
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me think.</v>

48
00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.810
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know what was going to get this</v>
<v Speaker 1>intense.</v>

49
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.600
<v Speaker 1>It's early crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These conversations or I don't know.</v>

50
00:02:03.601 --> 00:02:04.434
<v Speaker 1>I just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked the simplicity of it more than </v>

51
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.370
<v Speaker 1>Wayne Fetterman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

52
00:02:08.371 --> 00:02:10.650
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an unusual last name isn't a lot of</v>

53
00:02:10.651 --> 00:02:13.770
<v Speaker 1>Fetterman's so you could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could hang onto it like that,</v>

54
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.220
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let me turn it back on you.</v>

55
00:02:17.221 --> 00:02:19.110
<v Speaker 1>Am I allowed to do that or just to </v>
<v Speaker 1>answer?</v>

56
00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.320
<v Speaker 1>We're friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

57
00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.730
<v Speaker 1>Sophie to the for 22 years at Rogen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

58
00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.893
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

59
00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.620
<v Speaker 1>You don't want that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

60
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.790
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan is small name Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's quick.</v>

61
00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:33.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gin.</v>

62
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.910
<v Speaker 1>It's not hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like the name Wayne.</v>

63
00:02:35.911 --> 00:02:36.744
<v Speaker 1>So it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>

64
00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.650
<v Speaker 1>but I bought Joe Rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was another guy named Joe Rogan.</v>

65
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.570
<v Speaker 1>His identity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

66
00:02:43.571 --> 00:02:43.921
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

67
00:02:43.921 --> 00:02:46.020
<v Speaker 1>It was his real name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a,</v>

68
00:02:46.021 --> 00:02:50.070
<v Speaker 1>I think I had originally Joe Rogan </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience,</v>

69
00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.023
<v Speaker 1>like the same as the podcast name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what originally what I </v>

70
00:02:53.071 --> 00:02:53.940
<v Speaker 1>had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

71
00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.010
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy had Joe Rogan.</v>

72
00:02:56.011 --> 00:02:58.530
<v Speaker 1>So I contacted him and a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

73
00:02:58.531 --> 00:02:59.590
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can I buy it from you?</v>

74
00:02:59.591 --> 00:03:00.424
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

75
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.910
<v Speaker 1>And he sold to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Am I allowed to ask?</v>

76
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

77
00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:06.550
<v Speaker 1>Get a number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>

78
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.800
<v Speaker 1>Wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now that I'm thinking about this,</v>

79
00:03:08.801 --> 00:03:12.820
<v Speaker 1>this might not totally be true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That might be my space.</v>

80
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.110
<v Speaker 1>I think my space I bought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I bought Joe Rogan on my space.</v>

81
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.820
<v Speaker 1>When was the last time you were on my </v>
<v Speaker 1>space?</v>

82
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.220
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been never,</v>

83
00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:22.753
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't even me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think every seven years you're a new </v>

84
00:03:24.131 --> 00:03:24.964
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say that your cells completely </v>

85
00:03:27.161 --> 00:03:28.690
<v Speaker 1>swapped out of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a kid,</v>

86
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.580
<v Speaker 1>it's not really me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So seven years.</v>

87
00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.200
<v Speaker 1>It's been more than seven years for </v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

88
00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:33.723
<v Speaker 1>It's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

89
00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.670
<v Speaker 1>It's weird how like some people just </v>
<v Speaker 1>decide,</v>

90
00:03:36.671 --> 00:03:37.504
<v Speaker 1>like everybody was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my space is dead and then </v>

91
00:03:39.431 --> 00:03:40.160
<v Speaker 1>everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

92
00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.310
<v Speaker 1>Mindspace is dead time to get the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of there.</v>

93
00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:44.110
<v Speaker 1>And I'm still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm still on there.</v>

94
00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:45.490
<v Speaker 1>Are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>

95
00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.980
<v Speaker 1>I never check it or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's use it.</v>

96
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.420
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

97
00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:53.900
<v Speaker 1>but does it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still feel like I'm on there and there</v>

98
00:03:53.901 --> 00:03:56.590
<v Speaker 1>was a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can I make a recommendation about a girl</v>

99
00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.590
<v Speaker 1>on my space now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's on Youtube,</v>

100
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:00.723
<v Speaker 1>she's on youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she wrote a song years ago on the </v>

101
00:04:04.181 --> 00:04:05.014
<v Speaker 1>Ukulele,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the many instruments I </v>

102
00:04:06.581 --> 00:04:07.440
<v Speaker 1>play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

103
00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.630
<v Speaker 1>and it was called,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my hope is in the name of the song.</v>

104
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:11.463
<v Speaker 1>It's my recommend and it's about parents</v>
<v Speaker 1>forgetting their password to shut down </v>

105
00:04:17.081 --> 00:04:19.570
<v Speaker 1>their myspace account and their kids as </v>
<v Speaker 1>teenagers.</v>

106
00:04:19.571 --> 00:04:22.870
<v Speaker 1>Reading that in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried to shut my mind space down.</v>

107
00:04:22.871 --> 00:04:24.580
<v Speaker 1>There wasn't no good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It couldn't shut it down.</v>

108
00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:25.653
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they want anybody to shut </v>

109
00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.950
<v Speaker 1>it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't.</v>

110
00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.620
<v Speaker 1>I think they think somehow or another </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to come back,</v>

111
00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.440
<v Speaker 1>but then it just gets sold again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

112
00:04:32.441 --> 00:04:34.930
<v Speaker 1>but that's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think like they keep trying to move it</v>

113
00:04:34.931 --> 00:04:36.880
<v Speaker 1>around and sell eight if I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 1>mistaken.</v>

114
00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.280
<v Speaker 1>And I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you're into bands,</v>

115
00:04:39.281 --> 00:04:40.960
<v Speaker 1>we're going to find out to find out a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot about you,</v>

116
00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:45.550
<v Speaker 1>but like I feel like bands still have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>presence on my space.</v>

117
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.850
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not bands you want to see.</v>

<v Speaker 1>They used to call the people that landed</v>

145
00:05:57.381 --> 00:05:58.640
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

147
00:05:59.061 --> 00:06:01.250

<v Speaker 1>wolves.</v>

148
00:06:01.251 --> 00:06:03.730
<v Speaker 1>When they first encountered him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Lewis and Clark there,</v>

149
00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.530
<v Speaker 1>the first shot one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they thought it was a fox.</v>

150
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:07.640
<v Speaker 1>They wanted to see what it was.</v>

151
00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.500
<v Speaker 1>They shot it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they examined it and they said,</v>

152
00:06:09.501 --> 00:06:11.570
<v Speaker 1>that's not a wall fox,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a small wolf,</v>

153
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.940
<v Speaker 1>classic light guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's examine this shoot and kill it,</v>

154
00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.320
<v Speaker 1>kill it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and let's take a look a little.</v>

155
00:06:17.321 --> 00:06:18.320
<v Speaker 1>We got here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

156
00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:20.570
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they used to call him prairie wolves and</v>

157
00:06:20.571 --> 00:06:25.100
<v Speaker 1>then the trappers in counted a native </v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans who,</v>

158
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>called them,</v>

159
00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:27.283
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Co call you cause that was the Aztec </v>

160
00:06:30.411 --> 00:06:32.480
<v Speaker 1>word for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Aztec word was coit.</v>

161
00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:36.180
<v Speaker 1>And then the trappers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

162
00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.210
<v Speaker 1>encountered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

163
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:38.900
<v Speaker 1>or the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

164
00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.210
<v Speaker 1>native Americans encountered Spanish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

165
00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:46.020
<v Speaker 1>people from Spain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They called it [inaudible] because they,</v>

166
00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:49.220
<v Speaker 1>they had the Spanish pronunciation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the word coil.</v>

167
00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:53.780
<v Speaker 1>And then the trappers could not say </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

168
00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:57.210
<v Speaker 1>So they started calling them coyotes,</v>

169
00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:01.220
<v Speaker 1>coyote and prairie wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the original names.</v>

170
00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:04.910
<v Speaker 1>And of course [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was the yet as technique.</v>

171
00:07:04.911 --> 00:07:08.090
<v Speaker 1>And you still have 420 more pages to go.</v>

<v Speaker 1>it looked like a confederate flag </v>

303
00:12:53.651 --> 00:12:55.960
<v Speaker 1>because they had the Georgia delegation </v>
<v Speaker 1>right down front.</v>

304
00:12:56.170 --> 00:13:00.370
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Up Til 2001 they had a fucking,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you nailed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was their state flag.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I find,</v>

316
00:13:28.601 --> 00:13:30.370
<v Speaker 1>I guess maybe because I grew up in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>south,</v>

<v Speaker 1>like the confederate flag.</v>

<v Speaker 1>The London scattered things.</v>

321
00:13:41.621 --> 00:13:42.454

<v Speaker 1>The fact that learns skinner had that </v>

00:14:24.401 --> 00:14:27.730
<v Speaker 1>but it within the last 15 years that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were like,</v>

340
00:14:27.731 --> 00:14:32.110
<v Speaker 1>it's now a symbol of hate as opposed to </v>

00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:32.921
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was a little,</v>

00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:41.740
<v Speaker 1>the culture is kind of connected to </v>
<v Speaker 1>something fucked up.</v>

00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:02.773
<v Speaker 3>Like if they call,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when you hear coyotes call in the </v>

354
00:15:04.521 --> 00:15:06.920
<v Speaker 3>middle of the [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 3>do it again.</v>

355
00:15:06.921 --> 00:15:07.754
<v Speaker 3>Do it again.</v>

356
00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:13.660
<v Speaker 3>It's a weird sound.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The first time I heard it for some,</v>

357
00:15:13.661 --> 00:15:14.770
<v Speaker 3>I moved to California.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

358
00:15:14.771 --> 00:15:17.530
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when I moved here,</v>

359
00:15:17.531 --> 00:15:19.570
<v Speaker 3>he's a perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In 94,</v>

360
00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:21.760
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was living in New York,</v>

361
00:15:21.761 --> 00:15:25.210
<v Speaker 3>there's no fucking coyotes where I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>living like I was living in men.</v>

362
00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:26.680
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was in new Rochelle.</v>

363
00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:28.330
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's coyotes near now.</v>

364
00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:31.840
<v Speaker 3>There's coyotes in Westchester.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's coyotes in New York City.</v>

365
00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:35.130
<v Speaker 3>They've actually gone into the city.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a bunch of B.</v>

366
00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:36.183
<v Speaker 3>Dot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At one.</v>

367
00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:40.660
<v Speaker 3>They are the opposite of a danger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are everywhere.</v>

368
00:15:40.661 --> 00:15:44.620
<v Speaker 3>They are one of the most prevalent large</v>
<v Speaker 3>animals in North America.</v>

369
00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:46.900
<v Speaker 3>They are everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're in every single state.</v>

370
00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:48.113
<v Speaker 3>Just million questions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is the population increased since </v>

371
00:15:52.331 --> 00:15:53.860
<v Speaker 3>the Lewis and Clark?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hundred percent.</v>

372
00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:55.420
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not only that,</v>

373
00:15:55.421 --> 00:15:56.254
<v Speaker 3>the range,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the range is increased when they're </v>

374
00:15:57.940 --> 00:15:58.773
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's interesting about them is when </v>

375
00:15:59.891 --> 00:16:01.780
<v Speaker 3>they're persecuted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they spread out.</v>

376
00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:04.060
<v Speaker 3>They expand their range when they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>persecuted,</v>

377
00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:06.010
<v Speaker 3>just like Jews.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 3>We're talking about books.</v>

387
00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:23.560
<v Speaker 3>Nonfiction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

388
00:16:23.561 --> 00:16:24.670

<v Speaker 3>We were asking you about,</v>

389
00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:27.900
<v Speaker 3>you were talking about some book now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

390
00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:31.610
<v Speaker 3>we were just talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was saying that I don't read fiction.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

394
00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:39.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could get into a coyote book,</v>

395
00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:41.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a nonfiction,</v>

396
00:16:41.711 --> 00:16:42.560
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I like a,</v>

397
00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:44.830
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a Jack London story.</v>

398
00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:48.820
<v Speaker 3>Has It always been that way?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

399
00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:49.271
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

400
00:16:49.271 --> 00:16:53.460
<v Speaker 3>you had to in school read those books.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

401
00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:54.303
<v Speaker 3>You were forced to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We never got into books like they were </v>

402
00:16:55.991 --> 00:16:57.880
<v Speaker 3>never like fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My brother was,</v>

403
00:16:57.881 --> 00:16:58.714
<v Speaker 3>but I was not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had Robert Heinlein and all that </v>

404
00:17:00.881 --> 00:17:02.890
<v Speaker 3>science fiction books and I know that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

405
00:17:02.891 --> 00:17:06.050
<v Speaker 3>I've read a few and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just get,</v>

406
00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:08.680
<v Speaker 3>I just get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love movies.</v>

407
00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:12.370
<v Speaker 3>Like that's how I get my fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

408
00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:13.323
<v Speaker 3>movies are better if they're done right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's really better is television </v>

409
00:17:16.781 --> 00:17:18.500
<v Speaker 3>shows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The long form TV show.</v>

410
00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:20.320
<v Speaker 3>But you'd like thrones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

411
00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:24.210
<v Speaker 3>because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can go so much more like a novel,</v>

412
00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:25.900
<v Speaker 3>a novel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a novel.</v>

413
00:17:25.901 --> 00:17:30.901
<v Speaker 3>But you're seeing it and you're seeing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm using amazing acting and music.</v>

414
00:17:30.911 --> 00:17:33.380
<v Speaker 3>Exposed breasts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

415
00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:36.430
<v Speaker 3>That's what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

416
00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:38.980
<v Speaker 3>Because the one time I don't watch game </v>
<v Speaker 3>of thrones,</v>

417
00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:42.490
<v Speaker 3>but they both times I tuned in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen negative breasts.</v>

418
00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:46.420
<v Speaker 3>Is it every week they try.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just to get ratings.</v>

419
00:17:46.421 --> 00:17:47.171
<v Speaker 3>How does that work?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

420
00:17:47.171 --> 00:17:48.730
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I think people back then to show</v>

421
00:17:48.731 --> 00:17:49.920
<v Speaker 3>their tits lot what?</v>

422
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:51.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not real.</v>

423
00:17:51.811 --> 00:17:54.570
<v Speaker 1>It's not back then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not even a real play in the future.</v>

424
00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:57.460
<v Speaker 1>It could be absolutely like star wars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

425
00:17:57.461 --> 00:18:00.060
<v Speaker 1>Long time ago in a galaxy far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>far away.</v>

426
00:18:00.061 --> 00:18:01.620
<v Speaker 1>Like you would think star wars is in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>future,</v>

427
00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:02.663
<v Speaker 1>but it's actually in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would think game of thrones in the </v>

428
00:18:04.411 --> 00:18:06.120
<v Speaker 1>past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it might actually be in the future.</v>

429
00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:09.660
<v Speaker 1>Speaking of Star Wars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just stumped a star wars and that.</v>

430
00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:12.600
<v Speaker 1>How'd you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was about that song done.</v>

431
00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:14.500
<v Speaker 1>Don Don,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don Antenna,</v>

432
00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:15.900
<v Speaker 1>the antenna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

433
00:18:15.901 --> 00:18:19.030
<v Speaker 1>that's the darth vader's theme.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's actually a,</v>

434
00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:21.640
<v Speaker 1>that's not the actual name of that song,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

435
00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:22.523
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that song was not in the original </v>

436
00:18:24.841 --> 00:18:26.640
<v Speaker 1>star wars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

437
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.140
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

438
00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:29.810
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to a guy,</v>

439
00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:30.780

<v Speaker 1>you're wrong.</v>

440
00:18:30.781 --> 00:18:32.220
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you're wrong.</v>

441
00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:35.550
<v Speaker 1>And because I happened to be a nice guy.</v>

442
00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:37.480
<v Speaker 1>I know when I'm know I'm right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

443
00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:39.180
<v Speaker 1>I'll never bet somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:20.723
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

461
00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:22.950
<v Speaker 1>I know you wouldn't think so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

462
00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:25.110
<v Speaker 1>A little bit of trimming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Surprise.</v>

463
00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:27.240
<v Speaker 1>Now that you said it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not surprised.</v>

464
00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:32.270
<v Speaker 1>They all kind of blend in probably the </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect age to see star wars as a kid.</v>

465
00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:34.740
<v Speaker 1>I saw star wars a bunch of times as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>kid.</v>

466
00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:35.843
<v Speaker 1>It was one of those things where I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might've saw it 13 times or something </v>

467
00:19:38.851 --> 00:19:41.970
<v Speaker 1>crazy because it's one of those things </v>
<v Speaker 1>where kids in school with how many times</v>

<v Speaker 1>someone's come up to you and go,</v>

491
00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:46.020
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

492
00:20:46.021 --> 00:20:48.070
<v Speaker 1>when you're a little kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to stay friends</v>

493
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:49.440
<v Speaker 3>with people for that long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

494
00:20:49.441 --> 00:20:50.274
<v Speaker 3>like that you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't stay in the neighborhood </v>

495
00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:52.770
<v Speaker 3>and stay in the area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

496
00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:55.390
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just didn't stay there that long.</v>

497
00:20:55.391 --> 00:20:57.190
<v Speaker 3>I only lived there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We moved around a lot,</v>

498
00:20:57.191 --> 00:20:59.680
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which obviously not good for you.</v>

499
00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:03.160
<v Speaker 3>I moved around as a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean maybe not as much as you,</v>

500
00:21:03.161 --> 00:21:04.270
<v Speaker 3>but similar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>similar,</v>

501
00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:05.770
<v Speaker 3>similar to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

502
00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:06.260
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

503
00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:07.093
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's that healthy for </v>

504
00:21:08.051 --> 00:21:09.260
<v Speaker 3>kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it,</v>

505
00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:10.113
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought I learned a lot of great </v>

506
00:21:12.371 --> 00:21:14.140
<v Speaker 3>skills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We definitely do.</v>

507
00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:16.780
<v Speaker 3>You learn people skills and learn how to</v>
<v Speaker 3>communicate with people,</v>

508
00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:18.033
<v Speaker 3>but you also don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like that's a pretty important </v>

509
00:21:21.851 --> 00:21:22.960
<v Speaker 3>thing in life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>

510
00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:23.883
<v Speaker 3>But I also think that some people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they gain something by being secure and </v>

511
00:21:27.281 --> 00:21:29.850
<v Speaker 3>having friends and a community </v>
<v Speaker 3>confidence.</v>

512
00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:30.743
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

513
00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:31.953
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you saying you're not implying </v>

514
00:21:35.021 --> 00:21:37.210
<v Speaker 3>you're not confident guy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

515
00:21:37.211 --> 00:21:38.044
<v Speaker 3>I think I got my confidence from martial</v>
<v Speaker 3>arts and I went to martial arts because </v>

516
00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:44.340
<v Speaker 3>it didn't have any confidence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>

517
00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:46.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to start crying because it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>sad.</v>

518
00:21:46.910 --> 00:21:49.390
<v Speaker 3>Just the most sensitive I've ever seen </v>
<v Speaker 3>you in my life.</v>

519
00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:50.673
<v Speaker 3>What is happening?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that sensitive is that </v>

520
00:21:52.571 --> 00:21:53.440
<v Speaker 3>sensitive?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

521

<v Speaker 1>look at the way something's spelled like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that can't be right.</v>

704
00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:14.320
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if there's a word for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking at it for the hell.</v>

705
00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:16.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking at the pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mind.</v>

706
00:29:16.090 --> 00:29:17.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These all mugshots.</v>

707
00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:19.530
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of.</v>

708
00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:22.020
<v Speaker 1>They're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the Elvis Presley's shit.</v>

709
00:29:22.021 --> 00:29:22.854
<v Speaker 1>Two of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bullshit.</v>

710
00:29:22.890 --> 00:29:23.723
<v Speaker 1>It's Elvis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is bullshit because he was a at the </v>

711
00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:28.200
<v Speaker 1>White House and he wasn't accidental </v>
<v Speaker 1>yesterday.</v>

712
00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:29.693
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he took it as a joke and when </v>

713
00:29:30.891 --> 00:29:33.600
<v Speaker 1>might it be a security thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think you'd take him.</v>

714
00:29:33.690 --> 00:29:34.980
<v Speaker 1>Do you like how he's that way it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind you.</v>

715
00:29:35.010 --> 00:29:40.010
<v Speaker 1>I am a fan of what Elvis kind of is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

716
00:29:40.321 --> 00:29:45.321
<v Speaker 1>He's like this iconic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy Americana figure.</v>

717
00:29:45.630 --> 00:29:49.960
<v Speaker 1>I became a drug addict and got all fat </v>
<v Speaker 1>and sweaty and died on the toilet.</v>

718
00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:54.970
<v Speaker 1>I think there's less than later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember there's lessons in Elvis.</v>

719
00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:57.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think he certainly was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>talented singer,</v>

720
00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:58.361
<v Speaker 1>but a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a,</v>

721
00:29:58.361 --> 00:30:01.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fan of him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More of a cultural icon than I am.</v>

722
00:30:01.330 --> 00:30:03.340
<v Speaker 1>Even as a musician.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy Hendrix.</v>

723
00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:04.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not real.</v>

724
00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:09.100
<v Speaker 1>See that is the real writing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the actual image is from,</v>

725
00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:11.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the Jimi Hendrix experience,</v>

726
00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:14.110
<v Speaker 1>which is where I stole the name for this</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast.</v>

727
00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:15.380
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

728
00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:16.870
<v Speaker 1>the name of the band?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

729
00:30:16.871 --> 00:30:18.240
<v Speaker 1>Made me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>made me feel experiment.</v>

730
00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:20.200
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mitch Mitchell there.</v>

731
00:30:20.201 --> 00:30:21.940
<v Speaker 1>That's the real one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you up on the screen,</v>

732
00:30:22.090 --> 00:30:25.660
<v Speaker 1>that is the actual image.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the real image.</v>

733
00:30:25.661 --> 00:30:29.950
<v Speaker 1>He got arrested for heroin in Toronto,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this picture that I,</v>

734
00:30:29.951 --> 00:30:31.900
<v Speaker 1>and I bought this at a fucking nice </v>
<v Speaker 1>gallery.</v>

735
00:30:31.901 --> 00:30:35.440
<v Speaker 1>Two of these cons and then Rosa parks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

736
00:30:35.441 --> 00:30:38.380
<v Speaker 1>But the Rosa Park one is real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's 100% real.</v>

737
00:30:38.381 --> 00:30:40.540
<v Speaker 1>Is that when she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when she got arrested.</v>

738
00:30:40.810 --> 00:30:41.830
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was,</v>

739
00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:45.590
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people get that story wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of people think like,</v>

740
00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:46.473
<v Speaker 1>she sat in the front of the bus and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>was asked to move to the back of the </v>

741
00:30:50.141 --> 00:30:52.000
<v Speaker 1>bus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody else had done it before her.</v>

742
00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:52.870
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

743
00:30:52.890 --> 00:30:53.723
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

744
00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:56.440
<v Speaker 1>But even the front of the bus part is </v>
<v Speaker 1>incorrect.</v>

745
00:30:56.830 --> 00:30:57.790
<v Speaker 1>What part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it?</v>

746
00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:00.880
<v Speaker 1>It's Kinda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very mean minute thing,</v>

747
00:31:00.881 --> 00:31:04.870
<v Speaker 1>but I'm like a history dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a white section in the front,</v>

748
00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:06.550
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>African American in the book,</v>

749
00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:07.660
<v Speaker 1>in the back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

750
00:31:07.810 --> 00:31:09.820
<v Speaker 1>at the time they call black or colored </v>
<v Speaker 1>section.</v>

751
00:31:10.090 --> 00:31:12.310
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was in the colored section.</v>

752
00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:13.473
<v Speaker 1>But what happened was if the white </v>
<v Speaker 1>section filled up and a white person </v>

753
00:31:16.931 --> 00:31:19.150
<v Speaker 1>went back to the color texture and sit </v>
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>

754
00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:21.880
<v Speaker 1>you still had to stand up and give them </v>
<v Speaker 1>your seat.</v>

755
00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:23.500
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

756
00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:25.330
<v Speaker 1>And then she wouldn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

757
00:31:25.390 --> 00:31:28.030
<v Speaker 1>that was the start of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

758
00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:30.190
<v Speaker 1>I did not know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know it's a small,</v>

759
00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:31.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but everyone says,</v>

760
00:31:31.781 --> 00:31:32.920
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she wouldn't go to the back of the book.</v>

761
00:31:32.921 --> 00:31:33.581
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

762
00:31:33.581 --> 00:31:35.440
<v Speaker 1>that's even grosser.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

763
00:31:35.650 --> 00:31:36.550
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

764
00:31:36.551 --> 00:31:37.384
<v Speaker 1>Grocer just like literally just sitting </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and then just some guy just got </v>

765
00:31:40.771 --> 00:31:41.051
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

766
00:31:41.051 --> 00:31:45.880
<v Speaker 1>she's complying with your racist rules </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you're like not racist enough.</v>

767
00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:49.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

768
00:31:49.121 --> 00:31:49.930
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

769
00:31:49.930 --> 00:31:53.110
<v Speaker 1>so then that's when she got arrested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Parks original seat.</v>

770
00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:55.240
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were totally right.</v>

771
00:31:55.241 --> 00:31:56.380
<v Speaker 1>Am I correct?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

772
00:31:56.381 --> 00:31:57.980
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>

773
00:31:57.990 --> 00:31:59.620
<v Speaker 1>Ever seen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen this picture.</v>

774
00:31:59.621 --> 00:32:01.600
<v Speaker 1>There's a diagram like the Kennedy </v>
<v Speaker 1>assassination.</v>

775
00:32:02.110 --> 00:32:06.460
<v Speaker 1>It looks like the fucking magic bullet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rosa parks boarded the bus and sat in an</v>

776
00:32:06.461 --> 00:32:07.294
<v Speaker 1>aisle seat in the designated colored sex</v>
<v Speaker 1>colleagues stops later the driver told </v>

777
00:32:11.081 --> 00:32:11.914
<v Speaker 1>parks and three other blacks in her row </v>
<v Speaker 1>to move to the back to make room for a </v>

778
00:32:18.011 --> 00:32:18.844
<v Speaker 1>white man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The three blacks moved to the back </v>

779
00:32:20.501 --> 00:32:23.320
<v Speaker 1>parks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slid to an adjacent window seat,</v>

<v Speaker 1>like they didn't even want him to have </v>

784
00:32:35.351 --> 00:32:38.530
<v Speaker 1>to sit next to exactly what it was like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was an empty seat.</v>

785
00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:39.710
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Well that's it.</v>

820
00:33:58.451 --> 00:33:59.284
<v Speaker 3>Up in the above.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone should make a tour bus out of </v>

821
00:34:00.761 --> 00:34:03.310
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think outkast or something.</v>

822
00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:08.350
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about the band outcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

823
00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:12.490
<v Speaker 3>I think it might be better in a museum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

824
00:34:12.491 --> 00:34:13.324
<v Speaker 3>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's not a thing to have in a </v>

825
00:34:15.671 --> 00:34:16.570
<v Speaker 3>museum,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess it is.</v>

826
00:34:16.571 --> 00:34:19.180
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like when do you decide what,</v>

827
00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:21.490
<v Speaker 3>have you ever gone to one of those old </v>
<v Speaker 3>West museums?</v>

828
00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:25.590
<v Speaker 3>I went to an old West Museum in Montana.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty interesting where with city?</v>

829
00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:26.553
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bozeman.</v>

830
00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:28.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know Bozeman beaut.</v>

831
00:34:28.450 --> 00:34:29.680
<v Speaker 3>Billings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

832
00:34:29.710 --> 00:34:31.900
<v Speaker 3>I know the whole tour up there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pretty awesome.</v>

833
00:34:31.901 --> 00:34:32.734
<v Speaker 3>A museum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But one of the interesting things about </v>

834
00:34:34.121 --> 00:34:34.954
<v Speaker 3>it was they had these old stage coaches </v>
<v Speaker 3>and just have to imagine taking one of </v>

835
00:34:39.431 --> 00:34:41.410
<v Speaker 3>those fucking goofy things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cross the country.</v>

836
00:34:42.890 --> 00:34:44.920
<v Speaker 3>Not that long ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was long ago.</v>

837
00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:47.150
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's tricky.</v>

838
00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:50.140
<v Speaker 3>My horses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the theme of this podcast.</v>

839
00:34:50.170 --> 00:34:51.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not that long ago.</v>

840
00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:53.890
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really not that long ago.</v>

841
00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:56.320
<v Speaker 3>When you eat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get older and you realize,</v>

842
00:34:56.321 --> 00:34:58.230
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm almost 50 right.</v>

843
00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:00.370
<v Speaker 3>It's half a hundred years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The wild west,</v>

844
00:35:00.371 --> 00:35:03.250
<v Speaker 3>shit that was 200 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>200 years ago,</v>

845
00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:06.250
<v Speaker 3>less than two wild west is less than 200</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>

846
00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:08.200
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's post civil war,</v>

847
00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:09.063
<v Speaker 3>so it's like,</v>

848
00:35:09.650 --> 00:35:10.290
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

849
00:35:10.290 --> 00:35:11.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>150 years.</v>

850
00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:12.533
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well I mean when people first started </v>

851
00:35:13.891 --> 00:35:15.210
<v Speaker 3>coming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what year was it?</v>

852
00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:16.373
<v Speaker 3>I think the wild west is like the 18th </v>
<v Speaker 3>seventies 1865 is when slavery was </v>

853
00:35:21.751 --> 00:35:23.250
<v Speaker 3>abolished.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

854
00:35:23.370 --> 00:35:26.280
<v Speaker 3>is that the end of the wild west gun?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the start of it.</v>

855
00:35:26.430 --> 00:35:28.860
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>1865 when,</v>

856
00:35:28.930 --> 00:35:32.340
<v Speaker 3>well before that there were still </v>
<v Speaker 3>traveling across the country like,</v>

857
00:35:32.341 --> 00:35:32.770
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

858
00:35:32.770 --> 00:35:34.950
<v Speaker 3>the milestone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they delete the [inaudible] and all that</v>

859
00:35:34.951 --> 00:35:37.740
<v Speaker 3>jazz.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I still feel like that's a all of that,</v>

860
00:35:37.741 --> 00:35:38.574
<v Speaker 3>but I might be wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might be wrong because the 40 niners </v>

861
00:35:41.161 --> 00:35:44.340
<v Speaker 3>that's 1849 they're searching for gold </v>
<v Speaker 3>in California.</v>

862
00:35:44.370 --> 00:35:45.203
<v Speaker 3>So people are obviously trekking across </v>
<v Speaker 3>the country looking for gold in 1849 we </v>

863
00:35:49.831 --> 00:35:51.900
<v Speaker 3>know that nine or 49 ers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

864
00:35:51.930 --> 00:35:53.520
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know that we know.</v>

865
00:35:53.521 --> 00:35:57.410
<v Speaker 3>So maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe 1850s and when would they be?</v>

866
00:35:57.411 --> 00:36:00.810
<v Speaker 3>1850s what was the donner party?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How is that the family,</v>

867
00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:02.100
<v Speaker 3>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

868
00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:05.340
<v Speaker 3>they got stuck in the mountain and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>pass.</v>

869
00:36:05.490 --> 00:36:07.270
<v Speaker 3>Whew.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was that.</v>

870
00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:09.180
<v Speaker 3>That is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's intense.</v>

871
00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:11.670
<v Speaker 3>Trying to get over the fucking rocky </v>
<v Speaker 3>mountain in the winter.</v>

872
00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:13.920
<v Speaker 3>Not Good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

873
00:36:14.610 --> 00:36:15.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's even,</v>

874
00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:16.453
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would be like trying to do it with </v>

875
00:36:17.371 --> 00:36:18.204
<v Speaker 3>the hybrid.</v>

876
00:36:20.370 --> 00:36:21.910
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because those things don't have a lot.</v>

877
00:36:22.890 --> 00:36:23.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Test.</v>

878
00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:27.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Donner party was a,</v>

879
00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:29.520
<v Speaker 3>what does that say?</v>
<v Speaker 3>1846 yeah.</v>

880
00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:31.010
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we got them right here.</v>

881
00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:36.500
<v Speaker 3>I was wrong about the wild west.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess it's 1840s still again.</v>

882
00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:41.970
<v Speaker 3>Lewis and Clark was around 1804 so </v>
<v Speaker 3>around 1820s is 1820s okay.</v>

883
00:36:42.070 --> 00:36:42.903
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm wrong.</v>

884
00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:43.823
<v Speaker 3>I'm wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's essentially almost exactly 280 </v>

885
00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:47.100
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You were right.</v>

886
00:36:47.101 --> 00:36:47.934
<v Speaker 3>So fucking recent though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's so damn reason to think that 200 </v>

887
00:36:51.751 --> 00:36:54.600
<v Speaker 3>years ago there was no Chicago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like as we know it,</v>

888
00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:56.970
<v Speaker 3>giant buildings and airplanes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

889
00:36:56.971 --> 00:36:59.760
<v Speaker 3>San Francisco as we know it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No New York City as we know it,</v>

890
00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:03.330
<v Speaker 3>when New York City was kind of like </v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty much cosmopolitan,</v>

891
00:37:03.331 --> 00:37:04.164
<v Speaker 3>but they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they definitely had like buildings and </v>

892
00:37:05.161 --> 00:37:09.090
<v Speaker 3>stuff cause there's some buildings from </v>
<v Speaker 3>the 18 hundreds in a lot of spots,</v>

893
00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:10.253
<v Speaker 3>but this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this entire country go back 200 years </v>

894
00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:18.420
<v Speaker 3>and it's not much here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a,</v>

895
00:37:18.421 --> 00:37:20.130
<v Speaker 3>that's strange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>

896
00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:21.053
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

897
00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:25.860
<v Speaker 3>I'm more think it's beautiful and </v>
<v Speaker 3>fascinate that too.</v>

898
00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:27.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just think it's incredible.</v>

899
00:37:27.450 --> 00:37:29.040
<v Speaker 3>They're not mutually exclusive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wayne Fetterman.</v>

900
00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:30.780
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>correct.</v>

901
00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:32.250
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not the opposite.</v>

902
00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:33.690
<v Speaker 3>Could be both things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

903
00:37:33.930 --> 00:37:34.830
<v Speaker 3>It's all the above.</v>

904
00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:38.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is that.</v>

905
00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:41.520
<v Speaker 3>Now this country is,</v>

<v Speaker 3>fireworks.</v>

910
00:37:50.971 --> 00:37:53.190
<v Speaker 3>It's just the one that flashes and makes</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sound.</v>

911
00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:54.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know that one.</v>

914
00:37:58.501 --> 00:38:00.710
<v Speaker 3>Disneyland and stayed to the very end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would.</v>

915
00:38:00.730 --> 00:38:01.890
<v Speaker 3>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would.</v>

917
00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:04.103
<v Speaker 3>I love the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love the idea of this country who </v>

918
00:38:06.001 --> 00:38:08.310
<v Speaker 3>liked me too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what we went through.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

921
00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:14.910
<v Speaker 3>I would say I'm very appreciative of </v>
<v Speaker 3>being lucky enough to live here.</v>

922

<v Speaker 3>whenever we go to other countries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

926
00:38:22.170 --> 00:38:23.003
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was talking to this gentleman in </v>

927
00:38:24.210 --> 00:38:25.710
<v Speaker 3>Italy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was in Italy a couple of weeks ago,</v>

928
00:38:25.810 --> 00:38:26.643
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was talking to this guy about he </v>

929
00:38:28.561 --> 00:38:31.050
<v Speaker 3>wants to move to northern California.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wants,</v>

930
00:38:31.051 --> 00:38:34.590
<v Speaker 3>he wanted to move to a San Jose and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>has this idea,</v>

00:38:34.591 --> 00:38:37.720
<v Speaker 3>this is dream to take his kids and moved</v>
<v Speaker 3>to San Jose.</v>

00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:44.280
<v Speaker 3>it was kind of interesting talking to </v>
<v Speaker 3>him about it and then it got kind of sad</v>

934
00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:46.750
<v Speaker 3>because he was talking about his </v>
<v Speaker 3>children.</v>

935
00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:48.730
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's where he lives.</v>

936
00:38:49.090 --> 00:38:51.280
<v Speaker 3>There's no hope,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no future,</v>

937
00:38:51.281 --> 00:38:53.710
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing to plan for,</v>

938
00:38:53.711 --> 00:38:55.720
<v Speaker 3>there's no opportunities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>

939
00:38:55.721 --> 00:38:56.554
<v Speaker 3>I really feel like my children would </v>
<v Speaker 3>have an opportunity to succeed if they </v>

940
00:38:59.501 --> 00:39:00.640
<v Speaker 3>could go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go to America.</v>

<v Speaker 3>to come here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Irish when they got here.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Now I feel very,</v>

<v Speaker 3>We're well,</v>

964
00:39:52.991 --> 00:39:55.720
<v Speaker 3>when you go to other countries then you </v>
<v Speaker 3>really kind of get a sense of,</v>

965
00:39:55.721 --> 00:39:59.680
<v Speaker 3>first of all how recent this experiment </v>
<v Speaker 3>in self government really is.</v>

966
00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:00.911
<v Speaker 3>Cause a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

967
00:40:00.911 --> 00:40:01.744
<v Speaker 3>when we were in Italy we were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I took some photos at the Vatican and I </v>

968
00:40:04.961 --> 00:40:05.794
<v Speaker 3>posted them up on my instagram the other</v>
<v Speaker 3>day and one of them that was probably </v>

969
00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:12.190
<v Speaker 3>not maybe the most impressive but the </v>
<v Speaker 3>most put things into perspective.</v>

970
00:40:12.191 --> 00:40:13.024
<v Speaker 3>There's a floor of the Vatican where </v>
<v Speaker 3>they have the statue of Hercules and </v>

971
00:40:16.391 --> 00:40:21.040
<v Speaker 3>this tile mosaic floor is 1700 years old</v>
<v Speaker 3>and people walk on it.</v>

972
00:40:21.250 --> 00:40:22.083
<v Speaker 3>Thousands of people walk in this mosaic </v>
<v Speaker 3>tile and it's 1700 years old and it's </v>

973
00:40:27.341 --> 00:40:28.174
<v Speaker 3>just a tile for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's just one thing of in this </v>

974
00:40:32.770 --> 00:40:33.760
<v Speaker 3>insane there.</v>

975
00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:36.640
<v Speaker 3>That's the floor right there that at </v>
<v Speaker 3>1700 years old,</v>

976
00:40:37.090 --> 00:40:40.540
<v Speaker 3>and that's one tiny aspect of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Vatican.</v>

977
00:40:40.541 --> 00:40:45.340
<v Speaker 3>The Vatican is so monstrously huge and </v>
<v Speaker 3>incredible.</v>

978
00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:48.640
<v Speaker 3>It is one of the most breathtaking </v>
<v Speaker 3>things I've ever seen in my life.</v>

979
00:40:48.641 --> 00:40:53.350
<v Speaker 3>And the accomplishment of people from </v>
<v Speaker 3>hundreds and hundreds of years ago.</v>

980
00:40:53.351 --> 00:40:55.830
<v Speaker 3>They put together this building,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I even called them artisans.</v>

981
00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:56.950
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

982
00:40:56.950 --> 00:40:59.320
<v Speaker 3>I guess humans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Humans.</v>

983
00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:02.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>With the human beings can do is pain.</v>

984
00:41:02.570 --> 00:41:05.860
<v Speaker 3>I'd be just along design,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not quite as breathtaking is that,</v>

985
00:41:05.861 --> 00:41:10.861
<v Speaker 3>but just this morning someone posted </v>
<v Speaker 3>Steve Jobs announcement of the Imac when</v>

986
00:41:13.421 --> 00:41:17.530
<v Speaker 3>that came out in the nineties late </v>
<v Speaker 3>nineties and just,</v>

987
00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:20.410
<v Speaker 3>and then all the comments from the kids </v>
<v Speaker 3>who were just like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>the computer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking at this demonstration on </v>

<v Speaker 3>And what is interesting,</v>

996
00:41:36.651 --> 00:41:38.540
<v Speaker 3>no room looking like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is before,</v>

997
00:41:38.541 --> 00:41:43.160
<v Speaker 3>this is pre a tee shirt and jeans or </v>
<v Speaker 3>turtleneck and jeans.</v>

998
00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:44.173
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is jobs with a button up shirt all </v>

999
00:41:45.711 --> 00:41:48.730
<v Speaker 3>the way up to the neck and a blazer and </v>
<v Speaker 3>office.</v>

1000
00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:50.780
<v Speaker 3>Ma'Am.</v>

1002
00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:56.950
<v Speaker 3>But look how chubbies phases that poor </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy worked himself to death,</v>

1003
00:41:57.100 --> 00:41:59.060
<v Speaker 3>if I like that early.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Crushed his immune system with is an </v>

1005
00:42:02.190 --> 00:42:06.530
<v Speaker 3>intense pursuit of excellence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really,</v>

1006
00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:09.500
<v Speaker 3>I really think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that was a big part of it.</v>

1007
00:42:10.670 --> 00:42:13.760
<v Speaker 3>Did you read William Isaacson's?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isaac?</v>

1008
00:42:13.970 --> 00:42:14.803
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've read many accounts of people that </v>

1009
00:42:16.281 --> 00:42:17.114
<v Speaker 3>worked with them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've never read any biographies on </v>

1010
00:42:18.021 --> 00:42:18.880
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

1011
00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:19.813
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1012
00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:22.550
<v Speaker 3>I'm fascinated to it like that to </v>
<v Speaker 3>cautionary tale.</v>

1013
00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:23.420
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do.</v>

1014
00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:24.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>

1015
00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:25.160
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's,</v>

1016
00:42:25.161 --> 00:42:25.994
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a balance to be achieved and in </v>

1017
00:42:28.401 --> 00:42:29.234
<v Speaker 3>life and I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't necessarily think he achieved </v>

1018
00:42:31.131 --> 00:42:31.460
<v Speaker 3>balance.</v>

1019
00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:32.293
<v Speaker 3>I think he burned it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he went crazy and did the best </v>

1020
00:42:35.541 --> 00:42:38.150
<v Speaker 3>to make an incredible stuff and an </v>
<v Speaker 3>amazing company.</v>

1021
00:42:38.151 --> 00:42:38.984
<v Speaker 3>That's probably one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>innovative and influential companies in </v>

1022
00:42:41.841 --> 00:42:44.270
<v Speaker 3>the history of technology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No question,</v>

1023
00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:46.310
<v Speaker 3>if not the right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably the,</v>

1024
00:42:46.330 --> 00:42:48.350
<v Speaker 3>and it's a big part of it was his </v>
<v Speaker 3>vision.</v>

1025
00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:49.910
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the,</v>

1026
00:42:49.911 --> 00:42:54.140
<v Speaker 3>to me the most amazing of all the things</v>
<v Speaker 3>he did were,</v>

1027
00:42:54.170 --> 00:42:59.170
<v Speaker 3>what is those stores like Tim,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my mind,</v>

1090
00:45:23.730 --> 00:45:24.563

<v Speaker 3>I mean obviously they just panicked and </v>

1091
00:45:25.951 --> 00:45:26.581
<v Speaker 3>we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1092
00:45:26.581 --> 00:45:31.320
<v Speaker 3>I guess we have to have some presence in</v>
<v Speaker 3>these malls.</v>

1093
00:45:31.450 --> 00:45:33.300
<v Speaker 3>We have these apple stores are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1094
00:45:33.390 --> 00:45:36.210
<v Speaker 3>windows computers are pretty fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>good now.</v>

1095
00:45:36.330 --> 00:45:39.210
<v Speaker 3>And they had our touchscreen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of them have touchscreen,</v>

1096
00:45:39.290 --> 00:45:41.670
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I was at a a one of those best buys</v>

1097
00:45:41.671 --> 00:45:43.110
<v Speaker 3>or whatever the fuck it was the other </v>
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>

1098
00:45:43.111 --> 00:45:44.880
<v Speaker 3>And I was checking out the windows </v>
<v Speaker 3>computers.</v>

1099
00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:46.380
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's Kinda interesting.</v>

1100
00:45:46.381 --> 00:45:48.630
<v Speaker 3>Like you could touch the screen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would you jump?</v>

1101
00:45:51.580 --> 00:45:54.850
<v Speaker 6>Give a fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 6>But windows have many more,</v>

1102
00:45:54.851 --> 00:45:56.440
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>problems with viruses.</v>

1103
00:45:57.110 --> 00:45:58.540
<v Speaker 6>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're way more vulnerable.</v>

1104
00:45:58.570 --> 00:45:59.403
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And there's also compatibility issues </v>

1105
00:46:01.330 --> 00:46:03.100
<v Speaker 6>because,</v>
<v Speaker 6>excuse me,</v>

1106
00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:04.730
<v Speaker 6>one of the things that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1107
00:46:04.870 --> 00:46:07.960
<v Speaker 6>apple's done brilliantly is integrate </v>
<v Speaker 6>all the parts.</v>

1108
00:46:08.230 --> 00:46:10.960
<v Speaker 6>So the fact that you have the exact same</v>
<v Speaker 6>video card is everybody else,</v>

1109
00:46:10.970 --> 00:46:13.780
<v Speaker 6>you have the exact same motherboard.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Everything works together.</v>

1110
00:46:13.810 --> 00:46:15.370
<v Speaker 6>Everything works seamlessly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The,</v>

1111
00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:16.473
<v Speaker 6>the problem with windows is what </v>
<v Speaker 6>[inaudible] is going to do is going to </v>

1112
00:46:19.661 --> 00:46:21.630
<v Speaker 6>be different than with,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1113
00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:22.583
<v Speaker 6>Dell's going to do,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is going to be different than </v>

1114
00:46:24.371 --> 00:46:25.204
<v Speaker 6>what,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then you have to have all the </v>

1115
00:46:26.231 --> 00:46:27.064
<v Speaker 6>drivers in order.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then I see different companies put </v>

1116
00:46:30.011 --> 00:46:33.070
<v Speaker 6>their own proprietary stuff on there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then there's also,</v>

1117
00:46:33.100 --> 00:46:35.020
<v Speaker 6>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's more ways,</v>

1118
00:46:35.021 --> 00:46:35.854
<v Speaker 6>and obviously I'm not a computer expert,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but there's more ways to explore the </v>

1119
00:46:38.231 --> 00:46:41.410
<v Speaker 6>windows operating system apparently than</v>
<v Speaker 6>there is to exploit apple.</v>

1120
00:46:42.190 --> 00:46:44.910
<v Speaker 6>As far as like innovating or no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

1121
00:46:44.911 --> 00:46:45.744
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's fine.</v>

1122
00:46:45.850 --> 00:46:46.570
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>

1123
00:46:46.570 --> 00:46:47.021
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1124
00:46:47.021 --> 00:46:49.270
<v Speaker 6>how many viruses have been,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1125
00:46:49.300 --> 00:46:52.060
<v Speaker 6>the number of computer viruses alone.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

1126
00:46:52.061 --> 00:46:53.440
<v Speaker 6>that's a thing I was watching the other </v>
<v Speaker 6>day.</v>

1127
00:46:53.441 --> 00:46:57.550
<v Speaker 6>I was watching a documentary around </v>
<v Speaker 6>stuxnet and on how they,</v>

1128
00:46:57.640 --> 00:46:58.473
<v Speaker 6>they concocted this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a computer virus to attack the Iranian </v>

1129
00:47:02.501 --> 00:47:02.930
<v Speaker 6>news.</v>

1130
00:47:02.930 --> 00:47:04.190
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know all about this.</v>

1131
00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:04.940
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you?</v>

1132
00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:05.850
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1134
00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:09.020
<v Speaker 3>I mean obviously I didn't recognize that</v>
<v Speaker 3>name,</v>

1135
00:47:09.021 --> 00:47:11.840
<v Speaker 3>but there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that documentary is out now.</v>

1136
00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:13.130
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where did you see it?</v>

1137
00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:15.890
<v Speaker 3>In the hotel room?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hotel Room in Atlanta.</v>

1138
00:47:16.010 --> 00:47:17.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause there's a book,</v>

1139
00:47:17.180 --> 00:47:19.130
<v Speaker 3>there's a book about it now when it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>just like,</v>

1140
00:47:19.131 --> 00:47:24.131
<v Speaker 3>that's scary because now you can ruin </v>
<v Speaker 3>machines with computer virus.</v>

1141
00:47:25.100 --> 00:47:25.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>correct.</v>

1142
00:47:25.850 --> 00:47:29.080
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can or launch a missile or do a,</v>

1143
00:47:29.100 --> 00:47:31.780
<v Speaker 3>we'll shut down the power grid or do a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of different things.</v>

1144
00:47:31.781 --> 00:47:33.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

1145
00:47:33.010 --> 00:47:37.360
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy what they did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they relate to the United States and</v>

1146
00:47:37.361 --> 00:47:39.010
<v Speaker 3>Israel if I'm not mistaken.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

1147
00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:40.470
<v Speaker 3>Apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1148
00:47:40.530 --> 00:47:42.080
<v Speaker 3>I delwin stalking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1149
00:47:42.190 --> 00:47:44.410
<v Speaker 3>How did they get people to talk?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But how did they do it?</v>

1150
00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:46.420
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people in the documentary,</v>

1151
00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:48.740
<v Speaker 3>they were not real people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were,</v>

1152
00:47:48.741 --> 00:47:49.574
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a sort of a CGI version of a </v>

1153
00:47:52.331 --> 00:47:52.930
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>

1154
00:47:52.930 --> 00:47:56.020
<v Speaker 3>They used to talk and their voice was </v>
<v Speaker 3>all scrambled and,</v>

1155
00:47:56.021 --> 00:47:56.854
<v Speaker 3>but they were talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>developmental process and all the </v>

1156
00:47:58.871 --> 00:48:00.010
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is interesting.</v>

1157
00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:02.500
<v Speaker 3>They were saying that all the people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that work at the NSA.</v>

1158
00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:03.420
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

00:48:07.631 --> 00:48:08.464
<v Speaker 3>then there's like super nerds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's like people with like one guy </v>

1162
00:48:10.871 --> 00:48:11.704
<v Speaker 3>had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were saying had a death star that </v>

1163
00:48:13.241 --> 00:48:18.090
<v Speaker 3>he built out of Legos that sat on his </v>
<v Speaker 3>desk and like they had verizon.</v>

<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

1167
00:48:30.670 --> 00:48:31.503
<v Speaker 3>it was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting that there were sort of </v>

1168
00:48:33.131 --> 00:48:33.964
<v Speaker 3>describing the environment of working </v>
<v Speaker 3>there that is these sort of a computer </v>

1169
00:48:38.201 --> 00:48:39.034
<v Speaker 3>folks and super nerds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>super a computer geeked out wizards who </v>

1170
00:48:44.141 --> 00:48:44.974
<v Speaker 3>are working together with these military</v>
<v Speaker 3>characters and the military characters </v>

1171
00:48:47.861 --> 00:48:52.861
<v Speaker 3>are sort of guiding them to try to </v>
<v Speaker 3>create these viruses to attack these,</v>

1172
00:48:53.381 --> 00:48:55.630
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>various facilities that I ran had.</v>

1173
00:48:55.660 --> 00:48:58.660
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let's say again,</v>

1174
00:48:58.750 --> 00:49:00.640
<v Speaker 3>Delwin goes on the record about this </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

1175
00:49:01.060 --> 00:49:03.820
<v Speaker 3>Let's say this actually happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's assume it did.</v>

1176
00:49:04.090 --> 00:49:07.720
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was built at the NSA.</v>

1177
00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:10.270
<v Speaker 3>I thought that was just about </v>
<v Speaker 3>eavesdropping.</v>

1178
00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:12.130
<v Speaker 3>Stuxnet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1179
00:49:12.310 --> 00:49:16.150
<v Speaker 3>the computer virus was built there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone can cocked it.</v>

1180
00:49:16.151 --> 00:49:18.400
<v Speaker 3>I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they ever admitted or know</v>

1181
00:49:18.401 --> 00:49:21.230
<v Speaker 3>for sure where right now find out jamie </v>
<v Speaker 3>put up,</v>

1182
00:49:21.310 --> 00:49:23.200
<v Speaker 3>see what I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1183
00:49:23.230 --> 00:49:24.063
<v Speaker 3>cause I know I understood that it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>Israel and the United States and that's </v>

1184
00:49:27.761 --> 00:49:31.330
<v Speaker 3>how they shut down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They grinded that centrifuge.</v>

1185
00:49:31.331 --> 00:49:32.200
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

1186
00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:33.093
<v Speaker 3>They undermine the centrifuge and in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Iran and I think even that is a little </v>

1187
00:49:37.691 --> 00:49:38.524
<v Speaker 3>bit speculation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that's been 100% </v>

1188
00:49:41.770 --> 00:49:42.603
<v Speaker 3>documented.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We actually did it or where that Israel </v>

1189
00:49:45.191 --> 00:49:46.980
<v Speaker 3>was involved or both.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

1190
00:49:47.050 --> 00:49:49.420
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's 100% documented.</v>

1191
00:49:49.660 --> 00:49:50.171
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

1192
00:49:50.171 --> 00:49:51.370
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one goes on the record.</v>

1193
00:49:51.370 --> 00:49:52.203
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why I was asking who was talking </v>

1194
00:49:54.221 --> 00:49:55.270
<v Speaker 3>in this document.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1195
00:49:55.271 --> 00:49:56.650

<v Speaker 3>either.</v>

1196
00:49:56.651 --> 00:49:59.440
<v Speaker 3>I've watched the about 40 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like I get get the point here.</v>

1197
00:49:59.590 --> 00:50:01.560
<v Speaker 3>And then you went back to game of </v>
<v Speaker 3>thrones with the,</v>

1198
00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:04.960
<v Speaker 3>I don't think those breaths.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what I did.</v>

1199
00:50:04.961 --> 00:50:07.330
<v Speaker 3>I think I was leaving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was just watching it before I</v>

1200
00:50:07.331 --> 00:50:09.270
<v Speaker 3>had to leave.</v>

00:50:17.951 --> 00:50:19.810

<v Speaker 3>thinking that it was fake.</v>

1207
00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:21.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1267
00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:57.590

<v Speaker 3>But unfortunately for him,</v>

1268
00:52:57.591 --> 00:52:58.424
<v Speaker 3>he's in this bullshit world where you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to pretend you have to not </v>

1269
00:53:00.580 --> 00:53:03.040
<v Speaker 3>resetting sanctimonious about marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

00:53:03.230 --> 00:53:04.370
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not just that.</v>

1271
00:53:04.450 --> 00:53:05.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sanctimonious,</v>

1272
00:53:05.570 --> 00:53:06.640
<v Speaker 3>say sacred.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1273
00:53:07.540 --> 00:53:08.373
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1274
00:53:08.570 --> 00:53:09.230
<v Speaker 3>you will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1275
00:53:09.230 --> 00:53:12.260
<v Speaker 3>it's not just that it's also secret </v>
<v Speaker 3>sent.</v>

1276
00:53:12.290 --> 00:53:13.580
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

1277
00:53:13.581 --> 00:53:14.414
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>

1278
00:53:14.510 --> 00:53:15.343
<v Speaker 3>Sanctimonious is like you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>down to people who are not doing what </v>

1279
00:53:18.831 --> 00:53:19.640
<v Speaker 3>you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

1280
00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:20.473
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's also the issue that we </v>

1281
00:53:22.851 --> 00:53:25.950
<v Speaker 3>want someone who is a leader who</v>

1282
00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:29.520
<v Speaker 6>we have very unrealistic expectations of</v>
<v Speaker 6>them as human beings.</v>

00:58:54.791 --> 00:58:56.110
<v Speaker 3>going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1398
00:58:56.620 --> 00:58:57.520
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1399
00:58:57.521 --> 00:58:58.750
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're into that at all,</v>

1400
00:58:58.751 --> 00:58:59.770
<v Speaker 3>I'll see it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1401
00:58:59.830 --> 00:59:00.663
<v Speaker 3>You know what's interesting to me is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the same time what he was </v>

1402
00:59:02.741 --> 00:59:04.030
<v Speaker 3>experiencing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his meltdown,</v>

1403
00:59:04.060 --> 00:59:04.893
<v Speaker 3>Charlie Sheen was rising like a phoenix </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the ashes talking about doing blow </v>

1404
00:59:08.501 --> 00:59:11.200
<v Speaker 3>and bang and hookers and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't pay them for sex.</v>

1405
00:59:11.201 --> 00:59:12.810
<v Speaker 3>He pay him to leave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And everybody's like,</v>

1406
00:59:12.830 --> 00:59:14.840
<v Speaker 3>go charlie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tiger blood.</v>

1407
00:59:14.850 --> 00:59:15.683
<v Speaker 3>It's your point and your point you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>making exactly like there's that'll the </v>

1408
00:59:19.091 --> 00:59:22.280
<v Speaker 3>latitude of that kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's interesting to me</v>

1409
00:59:22.310 --> 00:59:25.190
<v Speaker 6>is that we've sort of crossed the </v>
<v Speaker 6>divide.</v>

1410
00:59:25.450 --> 00:59:26.283
<v Speaker 6>Donald Trump and Donald Trump is allowed</v>
<v Speaker 6>to kind of do whatever the fuck you </v>

1411
00:59:29.241 --> 00:59:30.770
<v Speaker 6>want.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know?</v>

1412
00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:35.210
<v Speaker 6>And especially when he's competing </v>
<v Speaker 6>against Hillary Clinton who's been shown</v>

1413
00:59:36.020 --> 00:59:38.870
<v Speaker 6>time and time again to be a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>complete liar.</v>

1414
00:59:39.050 --> 00:59:41.420
<v Speaker 6>She's just an absolute liar,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1415
00:59:41.570 --> 00:59:44.720
<v Speaker 6>On a grand scale,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like not just little lies,</v>

1416
00:59:44.721 --> 00:59:48.380
<v Speaker 6>but lies about all sorts of things,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like the origins of her name,</v>

1417
00:59:48.381 --> 00:59:50.480
<v Speaker 6>who she was named after.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like she's,</v>

1418
00:59:50.481 --> 00:59:54.130
<v Speaker 6>she's a crazy person and she's a </v>
<v Speaker 6>politician and like in an,</v>

1419
00:59:54.140 --> 00:59:57.590
<v Speaker 6>in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in a sober way re bizarre character.</v>

1420
00:59:57.800 --> 01:00:01.670
<v Speaker 6>So when a guy like Donald Trump is </v>
<v Speaker 6>competing against her,</v>

1421
01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:03.230
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and you know,</v>

1422
01:00:03.231 --> 01:00:06.650
<v Speaker 6>it starts naming her crooked hillary,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like someone,</v>

1423
01:00:06.651 --> 01:00:07.484
<v Speaker 6>someone tried to get some traction by </v>
<v Speaker 6>calling Donald Trump a womanizer and </v>

1424
01:00:10.401 --> 01:00:11.150
<v Speaker 6>saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1425
01:00:11.150 --> 01:00:13.550
<v Speaker 6>he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and people don't care who cames a fuck.</v>

1426
01:00:13.551 --> 01:00:14.900
<v Speaker 6>Of course he is looking at me.</v>

1427
01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:18.320
<v Speaker 6>He's a billionaire with a super hot wife</v>
<v Speaker 6>who did lesbian porn,</v>

1428
01:00:18.321 --> 01:00:19.310
<v Speaker 6>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you see that?</v>

1429
01:00:20.030 --> 01:00:22.140
<v Speaker 6>I don't lack a lot of porn.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Tell me about it.</v>

1430
01:00:22.141 --> 01:00:24.140
<v Speaker 6>In New York,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Daily News took a,</v>

1431
01:00:24.350 --> 01:00:26.160
<v Speaker 6>that some cover,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1432
01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:27.073
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>some photos that they put on the cover </v>

1433
01:00:29.090 --> 01:00:31.160
<v Speaker 6>yesterday and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was,</v>

1434
01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:33.410
<v Speaker 6>was the say Melania,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how'd he say it?</v>

1435
01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:38.920
<v Speaker 6>Well on it with a bow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

1436
01:00:39.290 --> 01:00:42.380
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Chuck Pal's a Wowza like,</v>

1437
01:00:42.381 --> 01:00:45.680
<v Speaker 6>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that is not just the hottest first lady,</v>

1438
01:00:45.770 --> 01:00:48.920
<v Speaker 6>potential first lady ever.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But off the charts.</v>

1439
01:00:49.220 --> 01:00:50.053
<v Speaker 6>It's like the difference Chine,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like who's the toughest fourth grader </v>

1440
01:00:53.091 --> 01:00:54.070
<v Speaker 6>and Mike Tyson,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1441
01:00:58.060 --> 01:01:01.100
<v Speaker 6>I mean fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean this,</v>

1442
01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:04.640
<v Speaker 6>this guy is going to be the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>president.</v>

1443
01:01:04.670 --> 01:01:06.950
<v Speaker 6>It's super pop.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's super possible.</v>

1444
01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:07.873
<v Speaker 6>It's not just 50 50 in my hand because I</v>
<v Speaker 6>think that as time goes on she looks </v>

1445
01:01:11.481 --> 01:01:14.840
<v Speaker 6>worse and worse and the only thing that </v>
<v Speaker 6>that saves her,</v>

1446
01:01:14.990 --> 01:01:15.823
<v Speaker 6>his,</v>
<v Speaker 6>his outrageousness and I think he hired </v>

1447
01:01:18.321 --> 01:01:21.440
<v Speaker 6>that guy who has that political </v>
<v Speaker 6>strategist that he hired that is um,</v>

1448
01:01:22.300 --> 01:01:23.630
<v Speaker 6>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I do not remember his name.</v>

1449
01:01:23.660 --> 01:01:25.010
<v Speaker 6>Paul Manafort.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is that his name?</v>

1450
01:01:26.210 --> 01:01:27.043
<v Speaker 6>Chief chief of his campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The most recent I that he hired about </v>

1451
01:01:30.441 --> 01:01:31.820
<v Speaker 6>three months ago,</v>
<v Speaker 6>four months ago.</v>

1452
01:01:31.970 --> 01:01:36.320
<v Speaker 6>But the idea was that this guy is going </v>
<v Speaker 6>to shape the new,</v>

1453
01:01:36.321 --> 01:01:37.154
<v Speaker 6>like the idea is like he's going to God,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he got the nomination now that he's got </v>

1454
01:01:39.891 --> 01:01:40.724
<v Speaker 6>the nomination nomination secure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now you go after Hillary and you bring </v>

1455
01:01:43.281 --> 01:01:44.900
<v Speaker 6>in all the people that are on the fence.</v>

1456
01:01:45.050 --> 01:01:46.910
<v Speaker 6>How do you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You become more moderate.</v>

1457
01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:51.940
<v Speaker 6>You become more,</v>
<v Speaker 6>less outrageous with your statements and</v>

1458
01:01:52.251 --> 01:01:55.170
<v Speaker 6>you try to point out the benefits of you</v>
<v Speaker 6>versus the,</v>

1459
01:01:55.460 --> 01:01:56.900
<v Speaker 6>the problems with her.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Of course,</v>

1460
01:01:57.770 --> 01:02:00.620
<v Speaker 6>if he does that successfully,</v>
<v Speaker 6>do you think he has a chance?</v>

1461
01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:01.970
<v Speaker 6>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>100%.</v>

1462
01:02:01.971 --> 01:02:03.470
<v Speaker 6>He has a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's the fucking Republican.</v>

1463
01:02:03.471 --> 01:02:04.640
<v Speaker 6>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he has a chance.</v>

1464
01:02:04.670 --> 01:02:05.503
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot of people that are just </v>
<v Speaker 6>not going to vote for Hillary because </v>

1465
01:02:07.041 --> 01:02:09.080
<v Speaker 6>they do not want more Democrats in </v>
<v Speaker 6>office.</v>

1466
01:02:09.081 --> 01:02:10.640
<v Speaker 6>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he fucking nuts.</v>

1467
01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:11.713
<v Speaker 6>Like this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>eight years of Clinton and then the </v>

1468
01:02:13.761 --> 01:02:16.400
<v Speaker 6>eight years of Bush and then you've got </v>
<v Speaker 6>eight years of Obama.</v>

1469
01:02:16.580 --> 01:02:17.413
<v Speaker 6>It's just stands to reason that you're </v>
<v Speaker 6>going to want to have eight years of </v>

1470
01:02:19.711 --> 01:02:20.850
<v Speaker 6>some Republican now</v>

1471
01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:22.890
<v Speaker 2>you ma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1472
01:02:22.950 --> 01:02:23.850
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1473
01:02:24.020 --> 01:02:25.370
<v Speaker 2>I looked at the polls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1474
01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:29.940
<v Speaker 2>I try not to follow because I just feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's so overwhelming at this point.</v>

1475
01:02:29.941 --> 01:02:30.774
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1476
01:02:31.350 --> 01:02:33.180
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like she's in pretty good shape.</v>

1477
01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:35.130
<v Speaker 2>Do you think so?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's again,</v>

1478
01:02:35.730 --> 01:02:36.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm a comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1479
01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:39.360
<v Speaker 2>like just what's today?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's today?</v>

1480
01:02:39.361 --> 01:02:41.370
<v Speaker 2>The 2nd of August.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1481
01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:42.690
<v Speaker 2>So this is what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's one sec.</v>

1482
01:02:42.900 --> 01:02:44.730
<v Speaker 2>We voted in November.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got along way to go.</v>

1483
01:02:44.731 --> 01:02:45.564
<v Speaker 2>We've got a hot 99 days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gary Johnson is going to be on your </v>

1484
01:02:48.121 --> 01:02:48.900
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1485
01:02:48.900 --> 01:02:51.090
<v Speaker 2>well he was supposed to be on the phone </v>
<v Speaker 2>with him.</v>

1486
01:02:51.530 --> 01:02:53.380
<v Speaker 2>Where am I?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're on a tweet with them.</v>

1487
01:02:53.381 --> 01:02:54.214
<v Speaker 2>When you mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you tweeted something with my name </v>

1488
01:02:55.171 --> 01:02:56.004
<v Speaker 2>and isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1489
01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:57.440
<v Speaker 2>that's the first time I've ever,</v>

1490
01:02:57.600 --> 01:02:59.610
<v Speaker 6>most likely he's going to have to pull </v>
<v Speaker 6>out on Thursday,</v>

1491
01:02:59.611 --> 01:03:01.610
<v Speaker 6>but he'll be back again.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We've already had them on once before.</v>

1492
01:03:01.611 --> 01:03:02.700
<v Speaker 6>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he was great.</v>

1493
01:03:02.730 --> 01:03:03.630
<v Speaker 6>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's great.</v>

1494
01:03:03.631 --> 01:03:05.140
<v Speaker 6>He's a good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's,</v>

1495
01:03:05.150 --> 01:03:05.983
<v Speaker 6>he's seat mean.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if I agree with him about </v>

1496
01:03:07.321 --> 01:03:09.240
<v Speaker 6>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I agree with them about most things.</v>

1497
01:03:10.050 --> 01:03:10.920
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1498
01:03:10.921 --> 01:03:15.090
<v Speaker 6>he's got some interesting ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but he's a reasonable person,</v>

1499
01:03:15.330 --> 01:03:17.640
<v Speaker 6>like an actual reasonable person,</v>
<v Speaker 6>meaning guy.</v>

1500
01:03:17.730 --> 01:03:20.040
<v Speaker 6>And the more he talks in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the more he,</v>

1501
01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:21.353
<v Speaker 6>the more he speaks.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If someone is going to get hurt by him </v>

1502
01:03:25.411 --> 01:03:27.250
<v Speaker 6>being around the question,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is,</v>

1503
01:03:27.251 --> 01:03:29.520
<v Speaker 6>is going to be trump or is it going to </v>
<v Speaker 6>be Clinton,</v>

1504
01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:32.520
<v Speaker 6>someone's gonna get hurt by this </v>
<v Speaker 6>reasonable alternative.</v>

1505
01:03:32.790 --> 01:03:33.623
<v Speaker 6>And this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is attitude that everybody has </v>

1506
01:03:34.951 --> 01:03:37.710
<v Speaker 6>about who are you throwing your vote or </v>
<v Speaker 6>if you're voted for him.</v>

1507
01:03:38.490 --> 01:03:40.680
<v Speaker 6>Not everybody does this is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is,</v>

1508
01:03:40.710 --> 01:03:41.543
<v Speaker 6>this is a stupid attitude and the only </v>
<v Speaker 6>thing that could possibly potentially </v>

1509
01:03:44.191 --> 01:03:47.310
<v Speaker 6>fuck a third party candidate is the </v>
<v Speaker 6>electoral college.</v>

1510
01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:49.530
<v Speaker 6>Like that's where things get really </v>
<v Speaker 6>weird.</v>

1511
01:03:50.700 --> 01:03:55.350
<v Speaker 6>The Electoral College,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the idea of the representatives,</v>

1512
01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:59.190
<v Speaker 6>you know like you don't necessarily vote</v>
<v Speaker 6>for,</v>

1513
01:03:59.220 --> 01:04:01.410
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the state picks a representative.</v>

1514
01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:04.080
<v Speaker 6>The representative is the one who kind </v>
<v Speaker 6>of puts in the vote.</v>

1515
01:04:04.110 --> 01:04:06.630
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it's that could fuck them,</v>

1516
01:04:07.830 --> 01:04:08.663
<v Speaker 6>but,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and also the idea that you're going to </v>

1517
01:04:10.491 --> 01:04:13.230
<v Speaker 6>throw your vote away if you vote for a </v>
<v Speaker 6>third party candidate,</v>

1518
01:04:13.410 --> 01:04:16.500
<v Speaker 6>that kind of fucks him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But we're going to have to come at,</v>

1519
01:04:16.570 --> 01:04:17.403
<v Speaker 6>there's gonna come a time where we </v>
<v Speaker 6>realized how ridiculous to pay two </v>

1520
01:04:19.531 --> 01:04:20.360
<v Speaker 6>barter system.</v>

1521
01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:22.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm with you on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody is,</v>

1522
01:04:22.430 --> 01:04:23.720
<v Speaker 2>who thinks it's great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's ending.</v>

1523
01:04:23.721 --> 01:04:25.130
<v Speaker 2>I find me the person who thinks it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>

1524
01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:25.993
<v Speaker 2>I think the DNC and the RNC think it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>great that they get to participate in </v>

1525
01:04:30.261 --> 01:04:33.310
<v Speaker 2>the debates and get money and all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that and it gets a really good,</v>

1526
01:04:33.650 --> 01:04:37.030
<v Speaker 2>what they did it their way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ernie never had a chore burned.</v>

1527
01:04:37.031 --> 01:04:37.864
<v Speaker 2>He didn't have a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chance they rigged it and then she </v>

1528
01:04:39.891 --> 01:04:43.310
<v Speaker 2>immediately goes to Hillary's campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We get a nice juicy reward.</v>

1529
01:04:43.311 --> 01:04:45.140
<v Speaker 2>Come on over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll get just some speech.</v>

1530
01:04:45.170 --> 01:04:46.003
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about Wasserman </v>

1531
01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:49.313
<v Speaker 2>Wasserman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1532
01:04:50.510 --> 01:04:51.680
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1533
01:04:51.710 --> 01:04:52.543
<v Speaker 2>I don't like talking politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like it's like talking about a </v>

1534
01:04:54.591 --> 01:04:55.820
<v Speaker 2>magic trick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1535
01:04:55.850 --> 01:04:58.010
<v Speaker 2>what I really liked is when he made her </v>
<v Speaker 2>11th grade,</v>

1536
01:04:58.400 --> 01:04:59.810
<v Speaker 2>he didn't really megger levitate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1537
01:04:59.811 --> 01:05:00.644
<v Speaker 2>You know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1538
01:05:02.570 --> 01:05:04.640
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me ask you about this then.</v>

1539
01:05:04.850 --> 01:05:07.370
<v Speaker 2>Please do talk about Michael Page.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1540
01:05:07.380 --> 01:05:08.660
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Michael Venom page.</v>

1541
01:05:09.010 --> 01:05:10.070
<v Speaker 2>I let him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's his middle name.</v>

1542
01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:11.810
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or just stage.</v>

1543
01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:13.000
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about the fighter?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1544
01:05:13.170 --> 01:05:14.540
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause they just,</v>

1545
01:05:14.541 --> 01:05:15.110
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1546
01:05:15.110 --> 01:05:17.110
<v Speaker 2>you know so much more about this than I </v>
<v Speaker 2>did,</v>

1547
01:05:17.111 --> 01:05:18.040
<v Speaker 2>but I saw</v>

1548
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:21.940
<v Speaker 3>the highlights of that fight and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>you tubed his other fights.</v>

1549
01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:22.793
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I've never seen anyone fight like </v>

1550
01:05:25.511 --> 01:05:26.344
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you watched his other fights </v>

1551
01:05:27.851 --> 01:05:30.160
<v Speaker 3>because there's one in particular seeing</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of his fights.</v>

1552
01:05:30.190 --> 01:05:31.023
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was one in particular where he's </v>

1553
01:05:32.861 --> 01:05:33.694
<v Speaker 3>fighting this guy and they get down to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the ground and they're grappling around </v>

1554
01:05:35.810 --> 01:05:38.470
<v Speaker 3>and all of a sudden he gets it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The guy caught him in a leg lock.</v>

1555
01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:39.333
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gets the guy's foot and he looks at the </v>

1556
01:05:40.541 --> 01:05:41.374
<v Speaker 3>guy and he started smiling as he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>turning his foot and then the guy </v>

1557
01:05:43.871 --> 01:05:45.190
<v Speaker 3>eventually at a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1558
01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:47.440
<v Speaker 3>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is like the,</v>

1559
01:05:48.070 --> 01:05:48.903
<v Speaker 3>he's hands down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that a style we don't fight hands </v>

1560
01:05:52.811 --> 01:05:54.220
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well you can.</v>

1561
01:05:54.370 --> 01:05:59.370
<v Speaker 3>The thing about it is he has a very </v>
<v Speaker 3>unusual set of skills.</v>

1562
01:06:00.220 --> 01:06:03.910
<v Speaker 3>What he is is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a sport karate champion and what sport?</v>

1563
01:06:03.910 --> 01:06:04.743
<v Speaker 3>Karate is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Point fighting is a style of fighting </v>

1564
01:06:08.050 --> 01:06:08.883
<v Speaker 3>where you dive in and you were </v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] point card at karate </v>

1565
01:06:12.050 --> 01:06:15.130
<v Speaker 3>tournaments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just tell me just quickly,</v>

1566
01:06:15.131 --> 01:06:16.450
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1567
01:06:16.810 --> 01:06:20.290
<v Speaker 3>Point karate is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The way it works is like there's a judge</v>

1568
01:06:20.291 --> 01:06:21.124
<v Speaker 3>on one side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a judge on the other side and </v>

1569
01:06:22.271 --> 01:06:22.991
<v Speaker 3>there's two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

1570
01:06:22.991 --> 01:06:26.890
<v Speaker 3>well there oftentimes just several </v>
<v Speaker 3>judges and there's two fighters.</v>

1571
01:06:27.820 --> 01:06:31.390
<v Speaker 3>And they stand the outside and the idea </v>
<v Speaker 3>is they blitz at each other,</v>

1572
01:06:31.391 --> 01:06:35.620
<v Speaker 3>they dive in and the idea is to try to </v>
<v Speaker 3>hit a guy once and if you tag them,</v>

1573
01:06:35.621 --> 01:06:37.630
<v Speaker 3>if you do tag and they stopped the </v>
<v Speaker 3>action,</v>

1574
01:06:37.810 --> 01:06:41.530
<v Speaker 3>the referee steps in and then the </v>
<v Speaker 3>referees will point.</v>

1575
01:06:41.710 --> 01:06:44.920
<v Speaker 3>Like oftentimes there's an exchange of </v>
<v Speaker 3>blows and the referees will say,</v>

1576
01:06:44.921 --> 01:06:48.520
<v Speaker 3>I got him with the straight punch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got him with the round kick.</v>

1577
01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:52.930
<v Speaker 3>And if there's no consensus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they continue to fight and no one gets a</v>

1578
01:06:52.931 --> 01:06:53.710
<v Speaker 3>point.</v>

1579
01:06:53.710 --> 01:06:57.550
<v Speaker 3>But if there is a consensus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if one guy one the exchange,</v>

1580
01:06:57.700 --> 01:07:00.160
<v Speaker 3>they will give like there's a great </v>
<v Speaker 3>point.</v>

1581
01:07:00.161 --> 01:07:01.990
<v Speaker 3>Karate fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1582
01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:02.913
<v Speaker 3>between Michael Venom page and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy who's a fighting and glory </v>

1583
01:07:07.991 --> 01:07:09.520
<v Speaker 3>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Raymond Daniels,</v>

1584
01:07:09.730 --> 01:07:11.440
<v Speaker 3>who's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>also,</v>

1585
01:07:11.750 --> 01:07:16.180
<v Speaker 3>he was originally a point karate </v>
<v Speaker 3>champion who went over to kickboxing.</v>

1586
01:07:16.181 --> 01:07:17.014
<v Speaker 3>Glory is a big kickboxing organization,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whereas Michael Page fights for </v>

1587
01:07:21.101 --> 01:07:22.930
<v Speaker 3>Bellatore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he's fighting MMA.</v>

1588
01:07:23.140 --> 01:07:23.973
<v Speaker 3>Whereas this other guy who was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>champion is like this is them fighting </v>

1589
01:07:28.931 --> 01:07:29.764
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1590
01:07:29.980 --> 01:07:32.670
<v Speaker 3>Is that page and I'm Daniel's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1591
01:07:32.730 --> 01:07:33.880
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see it.</v>

1592
01:07:33.910 --> 01:07:34.743
<v Speaker 3>See how they fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They wear these helmets on and the idea </v>

1593
01:07:36.971 --> 01:07:41.971
<v Speaker 3>is to just score to dive in and hit each</v>
<v Speaker 3>other and then get out.</v>

1594
01:07:42.340 --> 01:07:45.040
<v Speaker 3>And if they can hit each other and score</v>
<v Speaker 3>cleanly,</v>

1595
01:07:45.250 --> 01:07:47.110
<v Speaker 3>like watch what happens when they score,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll see it.</v>

1596
01:07:48.370 --> 01:07:51.070
<v Speaker 3>So they're bouncing around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they move very fast.</v>

1597
01:07:51.430 --> 01:07:52.263
<v Speaker 3>And the idea behind this is the blitz.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they noticed beeping in and </v>

1598
01:07:54.971 --> 01:07:56.980
<v Speaker 3>attacking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see how they bolt of their hands down.</v>

1599
01:07:57.130 --> 01:07:58.750
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't feel like the other guy has his</v>

1600
01:07:58.751 --> 01:08:00.350
<v Speaker 3>hands up a little more than Michael </v>
<v Speaker 3>Page.</v>

1601
01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:01.740
<v Speaker 3>Michael White?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1602
01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:03.810
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he is the bulk of the notes down.</v>

1603
01:08:03.850 --> 01:08:04.683
<v Speaker 3>They both have their hands down and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>other guy lifts his hands up </v>

1604
01:08:06.941 --> 01:08:08.200
<v Speaker 3>occasionally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but no,</v>

1605
01:08:08.201 --> 01:08:10.060
<v Speaker 3>they both have their hands completely </v>
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>

1606
01:08:10.630 --> 01:08:12.640
<v Speaker 3>The Orthodox method of holding your </v>
<v Speaker 3>hands up,</v>

1607
01:08:12.641 --> 01:08:17.300
<v Speaker 3>your hands would be at your cheekbones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These guys are not fighting and remotely</v>

1608
01:08:17.301 --> 01:08:18.134
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're both very similar in their </v>

1609
01:08:19.881 --> 01:08:20.714
<v Speaker 3>style.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1610
01:08:20.780 --> 01:08:22.820
<v Speaker 3>I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this style,</v>

1611
01:08:23.540 --> 01:08:24.373
<v Speaker 3>I know Sandy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like 80 people in the crowd who goes to </v>

1612
01:08:26.751 --> 01:08:29.390
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mostly karate students most,</v>

1613
01:08:29.391 --> 01:08:32.330
<v Speaker 3>it's mostly people that are either their</v>
<v Speaker 3>students,</v>

1614
01:08:32.390 --> 01:08:33.223
<v Speaker 3>their fellow students are competing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're sitting there watching or </v>

1615
01:08:35.091 --> 01:08:38.570
<v Speaker 3>they're going to compete and they watch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or the families of the people competing.</v>

1616
01:08:38.810 --> 01:08:41.360
<v Speaker 3>But it never really became much of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>spectator sport.</v>

1617
01:08:41.390 --> 01:08:44.510
<v Speaker 3>I could understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a very unique talent.</v>

1618
01:08:44.540 --> 01:08:48.080
<v Speaker 3>The ability to leap in and perform those</v>
<v Speaker 3>techniques very quickly.</v>

1619
01:08:48.290 --> 01:08:49.123
<v Speaker 3>And most fighters don't have that timing</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they don't know how to avoid it and </v>

1620
01:08:53.451 --> 01:08:55.460
<v Speaker 3>they don't have the ability to avoid </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1621
01:08:55.461 --> 01:08:57.350
<v Speaker 3>Crazy bummer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How's good to see you?</v>

1622
01:08:57.360 --> 01:08:58.670
<v Speaker 3>Very good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very good.</v>

1623
01:08:58.940 --> 01:09:01.100
<v Speaker 3>Well he was a world champion and a sport</v>
<v Speaker 3>karate.</v>

1624
01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:02.533
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1625
01:09:03.140 --> 01:09:05.390
<v Speaker 3>That stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a world champion and so what he had</v>

1626
01:09:05.420 --> 01:09:07.850
<v Speaker 3>to do is you just had to learn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take down defense,</v>

1627
01:09:08.030 --> 01:09:10.250
<v Speaker 3>and then he had to learn some </v>
<v Speaker 3>submissions and some grappling.</v>

1628
01:09:10.470 --> 01:09:12.020
<v Speaker 3>It takes a long time to learn those </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

1629
01:09:12.021 --> 01:09:16.010
<v Speaker 3>But if you are the type of person that </v>
<v Speaker 3>could become a champion in one aspect of</v>

1630
01:09:16.011 --> 01:09:16.844
<v Speaker 3>martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that type of intense dedication and </v>

1631
01:09:19.311 --> 01:09:20.144
<v Speaker 3>focus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could transfer that potentially to </v>

1632
01:09:21.951 --> 01:09:24.500
<v Speaker 3>other martial arts if you have the time </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you have an inclination.</v>

1633
01:09:24.530 --> 01:09:25.363
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I read something that you said that was </v>

1634
01:09:26.301 --> 01:09:28.520
<v Speaker 3>the worst injury you ever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so yeah.</v>

1635
01:09:28.730 --> 01:09:31.080
<v Speaker 3>Is that hyperbole or no?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1636
01:09:31.140 --> 01:09:31.973
<v Speaker 3>So worst mma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm never seen anybody get their skull </v>

1637
01:09:33.291 --> 01:09:35.750
<v Speaker 3>crushed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the worst injury I've ever seen.</v>

1638
01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:39.320
<v Speaker 3>I've seen broken orbital bones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's fairly common.</v>

1639
01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:40.820
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The uh,</v>

1640
01:09:41.090 --> 01:09:44.600
<v Speaker 3>the bones around your eyeball or are </v>
<v Speaker 3>fairly fragile,</v>

1641
01:09:44.810 --> 01:09:45.643
<v Speaker 3>but the forehead,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen anybody's forehead get </v>

1642
01:09:46.911 --> 01:09:47.744
<v Speaker 3>crushed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but as a perfect storm [inaudible] he </v>

1643
01:09:50.721 --> 01:09:54.050
<v Speaker 3>charged in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tried to shoot for a take down and page,</v>

1644
01:09:54.051 --> 01:09:56.480
<v Speaker 3>caught him with a knee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He leaped in.</v>

1645
01:09:56.540 --> 01:09:57.610
<v Speaker 3>Elite caught him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1646
01:09:57.650 --> 01:10:00.200
<v Speaker 3>What's the name of that jumping knee?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say it again.</v>

1647
01:10:00.230 --> 01:10:01.063
<v Speaker 3>Jumping knee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just jumped up and hit him with a </v>

1648
01:10:03.141 --> 01:10:05.240
<v Speaker 3>knee pain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jumping knee.</v>

1649
01:10:05.300 --> 01:10:10.300
<v Speaker 3>That sounds like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like an Indian who didn't need yeah,</v>

1650
01:10:12.140 --> 01:10:14.050
<v Speaker 3>and jumping.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

1651
01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:15.170
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>

1652
01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:17.450
<v Speaker 3>It is intense to see Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1653
01:10:17.451 --> 01:10:18.284
<v Speaker 3>it was intense.</v>

1654
01:10:18.350 --> 01:10:19.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1655
01:10:19.050 --> 01:10:19.910
<v Speaker 3>I'm not kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

1656
01:10:19.911 --> 01:10:20.990
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>

1657
01:10:21.020 --> 01:10:21.853
<v Speaker 3>Well I've been involved in martial arts </v>
<v Speaker 3>for more than since you were scared </v>

1658
01:10:26.090 --> 01:10:27.020
<v Speaker 3>little child.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1659
01:10:27.021 --> 01:10:27.854
<v Speaker 3>More than 30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I've never seen that injury and </v>

1660
01:10:30.091 --> 01:10:31.460
<v Speaker 3>never seen it that bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1661
01:10:31.461 --> 01:10:34.730
<v Speaker 3>I saw also your buddy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if he's your buddy.</v>

1662
01:10:35.020 --> 01:10:35.841
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Silva.</v>

1663
01:10:35.841 --> 01:10:39.710
<v Speaker 3>What's his first Anderson Silva.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anderson Silva break his own leg.</v>

1664
01:10:40.070 --> 01:10:42.090
<v Speaker 3>I've seen that before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen that a couple of times.</v>

1665
01:10:42.110 --> 01:10:43.100
<v Speaker 3>You ever done that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1666
01:10:43.101 --> 01:10:45.350
<v Speaker 3>I've never your own leg?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1667
01:10:45.380 --> 01:10:48.320
<v Speaker 3>but I did get my leg broken before I </v>
<v Speaker 3>broke the,</v>

1668
01:10:48.321 --> 01:10:49.180
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not the,</v>

1669
01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:52.340
<v Speaker 3>with the Tibia as the large shin bone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I broke the fibula.</v>

1670
01:10:52.610 --> 01:10:55.820
<v Speaker 3>Somebody we collided.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was actually a sparring session.</v>

1671
01:10:56.300 --> 01:10:57.133
<v Speaker 3>A friend of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a threw a kick and I have through kick </v>

1672
01:10:58.491 --> 01:10:59.324
<v Speaker 3>at the same time and his heel hit my </v>
<v Speaker 3>fibula and I've got a hairline fracture </v>

1673
01:11:02.541 --> 01:11:04.850
<v Speaker 3>in my fibula but not broken.</v>

1674
01:11:04.850 --> 01:11:07.980
<v Speaker 3>Like it didn't break like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it could have seen.</v>

1675
01:11:08.060 --> 01:11:09.950
<v Speaker 3>Had you seen that before?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1676
01:11:10.220 --> 01:11:11.053
<v Speaker 3>See what happened to Anderson is he </v>
<v Speaker 3>broke it earlier and then he broke it </v>

1677
01:11:13.590 --> 01:11:15.630
<v Speaker 3>all the way through,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he cracked it.</v>

1678
01:11:15.780 --> 01:11:16.613
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one kick that he threw in the same </v>

1679
01:11:17.821 --> 01:11:18.654
<v Speaker 3>height.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

1680
01:11:18.780 --> 01:11:20.290
<v Speaker 3>Oh crap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey.</v>

1681
01:11:20.291 --> 01:11:22.740
<v Speaker 3>He really cracked it before that because</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1682
01:11:22.741 --> 01:11:23.910
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was hurting,</v>

1683
01:11:24.390 --> 01:11:25.223
<v Speaker 3>and then he threw that kick and hit the </v>
<v Speaker 3>exact same spot and just snap like a </v>

1684
01:11:28.171 --> 01:11:30.450
<v Speaker 3>twig.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's according to his manager.</v>

1685
01:11:30.451 --> 01:11:34.440
<v Speaker 3>His manager feels like he broke it </v>
<v Speaker 3>before that and then broke it again.</v>

1686
01:11:34.980 --> 01:11:37.590
<v Speaker 3>It's very unusual to see someone's legs </v>
<v Speaker 3>snap like that,</v>

1687
01:11:37.591 --> 01:11:40.530
<v Speaker 3>but it happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There it is right there.</v>

1688
01:11:40.680 --> 01:11:44.520
<v Speaker 3>I've seen it happen three times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Person giving,</v>

1689
01:11:44.610 --> 01:11:45.443
<v Speaker 3>kicking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's always the person kicking the </v>

1690
01:11:46.771 --> 01:11:48.620
<v Speaker 3>person kicking price their own legs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1691
01:11:48.750 --> 01:11:51.180
<v Speaker 3>Occasionally it's the person on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>other side,</v>

1692
01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:53.370
<v Speaker 3>but it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the difference is,</v>

1693
01:11:53.371 --> 01:11:54.204
<v Speaker 3>is where you're kicking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're kicking with the middle or the </v>

1694
01:11:56.551 --> 01:11:59.100
<v Speaker 3>bottom of your Shin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a thinner bone.</v>

1695
01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:00.233
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you're colliding with the top of </v>

1696
01:12:01.621 --> 01:12:04.500
<v Speaker 3>the knee where the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the the Tibia,</v>

1697
01:12:04.900 --> 01:12:07.890
<v Speaker 3>the knee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It didn't seem possible.</v>

1698
01:12:08.030 --> 01:12:11.120
<v Speaker 3>It just didn't seem there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could see it as snapping.</v>

1699
01:12:11.250 --> 01:12:13.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember Joe Theismann?</v>

1700
01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:14.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember that Monday night game?</v>

1701
01:12:15.210 --> 01:12:16.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1702
01:12:16.861 --> 01:12:19.770
<v Speaker 3>I'm broken legs or particularly </v>
<v Speaker 3>disturbing for people.</v>

1703
01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:23.100
<v Speaker 3>There's a guy named tyrone spong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you're saying not for you like,</v>

1704
01:12:23.250 --> 01:12:24.240
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it bothers me,</v>

1705
01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:27.240
<v Speaker 3>but you're looking at me like you people</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1706
01:12:27.390 --> 01:12:28.620
<v Speaker 3>that probably about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You Wayne.</v>

1707
01:12:28.740 --> 01:12:32.730
<v Speaker 3>I have seen for sure I've seen way too </v>
<v Speaker 3>many people get injured.</v>

1708
01:12:32.850 --> 01:12:35.070
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're a little more immune to little</v>

1709
01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:36.900
<v Speaker 3>immune.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've told the story before,</v>

1710
01:12:36.901 --> 01:12:39.260
<v Speaker 3>but this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my wife was there,</v>

1711
01:12:39.590 --> 01:12:41.120
<v Speaker 3>her leg.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She had the uh,</v>

1712
01:12:41.190 --> 01:12:42.060
<v Speaker 3>card,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1713
01:12:42.061 --> 01:12:43.470
<v Speaker 3>hatch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1714
01:12:43.471 --> 01:12:44.304
<v Speaker 3>like the back of the hatch and she had a</v>
<v Speaker 3>package and she lifted her head up and </v>

1715
01:12:47.341 --> 01:12:51.510
<v Speaker 3>hit the corner of the hatch and cut her </v>
<v Speaker 3>for it and blood pouring down her head.</v>

1716
01:12:51.780 --> 01:12:55.200
<v Speaker 3>She was freaking out because she was </v>
<v Speaker 3>bleeding and I looked at it,</v>

1717
01:12:55.201 --> 01:12:58.020
<v Speaker 3>I was like snuffin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like mica stitch like one stitch.</v>

1718
01:12:58.050 --> 01:12:59.040
<v Speaker 3>It's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't worry about it.</v>

1719
01:12:59.250 --> 01:13:00.210
<v Speaker 3>Like to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1720
01:13:00.211 --> 01:13:01.230
<v Speaker 3>walk it off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1721
01:13:01.231 --> 01:13:04.830
<v Speaker 3>this is nothing like I'm so used to </v>
<v Speaker 3>seeing people just caught open,</v>

1722
01:13:05.010 --> 01:13:06.810
<v Speaker 3>smashed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>broken nose,</v>

1723
01:13:06.811 --> 01:13:09.660
<v Speaker 3>swollen eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cuts all over their face,</v>

1724
01:13:09.900 --> 01:13:11.340
<v Speaker 3>head kick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>knockouts,</v>

1725
01:13:11.370 --> 01:13:13.800
<v Speaker 3>arm's broken,</v>
<v Speaker 3>snapped legs,</v>

1726
01:13:14.490 --> 01:13:15.420
<v Speaker 3>torn apart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>knees.</v>

1727
01:13:15.421 --> 01:13:16.254
<v Speaker 3>I'm so used to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's just in the comedy clubs </v>

1728
01:13:20.070 --> 01:13:23.790
<v Speaker 3>Janam hell and try to win.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you've seen it all.</v>

1729
01:13:23.850 --> 01:13:27.360
<v Speaker 3>I've just seen thousands of fights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I've seen,</v>

1730
01:13:27.361 --> 01:13:31.410
<v Speaker 3>I've called professionally at least </v>
<v Speaker 3>probably 1500 funds.</v>

1731
01:13:32.100 --> 01:13:35.310
<v Speaker 3>So I've seen so many knockouts and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>many injuries.</v>

1732
01:13:35.311 --> 01:13:38.910
<v Speaker 3>I'm so used to seeing trauma almost too </v>
<v Speaker 3>used to it.</v>

1733
01:13:38.911 --> 01:13:41.860
<v Speaker 3>Like it doesn't bother me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How can people get injured?</v>

1734
01:13:42.940 --> 01:13:45.630
<v Speaker 3>And that was paid 100% a hundred percent</v>
<v Speaker 3>the worst.</v>

1735
01:13:45.870 --> 01:13:47.790
<v Speaker 3>Definitely the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Never seen that.</v>

1736
01:13:48.340 --> 01:13:49.173
<v Speaker 3>That's your fucking brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the protection that your brain </v>

1737
01:13:51.331 --> 01:13:53.640
<v Speaker 3>has to the outside world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's basically gone.</v>

1738
01:13:53.940 --> 01:13:55.680
<v Speaker 3>And if he got hit again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that same spot,</v>

1739
01:13:55.860 --> 01:13:57.180
<v Speaker 3>he's probably dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dead.</v>

1740
01:13:57.390 --> 01:13:58.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1741
01:13:58.351 --> 01:13:59.250
<v Speaker 3>how's he doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How's,</v>

1742
01:13:59.251 --> 01:14:00.390
<v Speaker 3>he said look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1743
01:14:00.750 --> 01:14:03.540
<v Speaker 3>we can see how he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the surgery.</v>

1744
01:14:03.541 --> 01:14:05.220
<v Speaker 3>The pictures on the ride or post </v>
<v Speaker 3>surgery?</v>

1745
01:14:06.020 --> 01:14:08.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that what they put in there and those</v>

1746
01:14:08.191 --> 01:14:10.800
<v Speaker 3>little metal look in there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can see it.</v>

1747
01:14:11.110 --> 01:14:13.540
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are plates that they've,</v>

1748
01:14:13.541 --> 01:14:14.374
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most likely titanium that they've </v>

1749
01:14:15.731 --> 01:14:17.920
<v Speaker 3>screwed in place to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1750
01:14:17.980 --> 01:14:22.210
<v Speaker 3>sort of reconstruct his scholar on of </v>
<v Speaker 3>his skull.</v>

1751
01:14:22.270 --> 01:14:23.103
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've pulled it up and he wheeling </v>

1752
01:14:24.940 --> 01:14:26.410
<v Speaker 3>ever wrestle again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fight.</v>

1753
01:14:26.411 --> 01:14:27.460
<v Speaker 3>You mean fight?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1754
01:14:27.470 --> 01:14:28.990
<v Speaker 3>me starts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could wrestle again.</v>

1755
01:14:29.140 --> 01:14:29.560
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1756
01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:34.560
<v Speaker 3>the question remains is if any </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychosocial psychological,</v>

1757
01:14:35.140 --> 01:14:36.490
<v Speaker 3>it's not what I would be worried about.</v>

1758
01:14:36.490 --> 01:14:37.323
<v Speaker 3>I'd be worried about the actual </v>
<v Speaker 3>physiological damage is more than </v>

1759
01:14:38.921 --> 01:14:39.870
<v Speaker 3>psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1760
01:14:39.950 --> 01:14:40.783
<v Speaker 3>Expanding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1761
01:14:40.930 --> 01:14:43.990
<v Speaker 3>he had to get his fucking skin pulled </v>
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>

1762
01:14:44.230 --> 01:14:45.063
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you look at what they did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they literally made a scar around the </v>

1763
01:14:47.621 --> 01:14:49.710
<v Speaker 3>top of his head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at what it needed.</v>

1764
01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:52.990
<v Speaker 3>His hairline is essentially a giant scar</v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

1765
01:14:53.170 --> 01:14:54.003
<v Speaker 3>They pulled his face forward and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>rebuilt his forehead with these fucking </v>

1766
01:15:00.041 --> 01:15:01.510
<v Speaker 3>bolt there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He buys knows too.</v>

1767
01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:04.720
<v Speaker 3>Apparently his nose a shatter too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

1768
01:15:04.721 --> 01:15:08.890
<v Speaker 3>it's like a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very significant injury and I just think</v>

1769
01:15:08.891 --> 01:15:12.490
<v Speaker 3>psychologically you could never maybe </v>
<v Speaker 3>get used to it.</v>

1770
01:15:13.330 --> 01:15:16.150
<v Speaker 3>Get used to getting hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guys get used to getting knocked down.</v>

1771
01:15:16.180 --> 01:15:18.490
<v Speaker 3>Guys get used to getting punched.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get used to it.</v>

1772
01:15:18.850 --> 01:15:19.780
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1773
01:15:20.260 --> 01:15:21.093
<v Speaker 3>it's a part of who you are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if that's what you choose to do for a </v>

1774
01:15:23.201 --> 01:15:25.540
<v Speaker 3>living.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I mean his [inaudible] have you been</v>

1775
01:15:25.541 --> 01:15:27.700
<v Speaker 3>knocked out like out nick unconscious?</v>

1776
01:15:27.700 --> 01:15:28.930

1777
01:15:28.990 --> 01:15:29.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

1778

1779
01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:35.750

<v Speaker 3>Like you get hit in the jaw and you seem</v>

1780
01:15:35.751 --> 01:15:40.060
<v Speaker 3>like stop working and you just collapse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I got back up and I got dropped</v>

1781
01:15:40.061 --> 01:15:40.894
<v Speaker 3>again and the referee stopped the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I was conscious that was the last </v>

1782
01:15:43.061 --> 01:15:44.580
<v Speaker 3>fight I ever had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was a kickboxing fight.</v>

1815
01:16:55.660 --> 01:16:56.493
<v Speaker 3>not Anderson Silva.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Heath herring was doing a face off with </v>

1816
01:16:59.111 --> 01:17:01.120
<v Speaker 3>this Japanese gentlemen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember the guy's name,</v>

1817
01:17:01.121 --> 01:17:03.160
<v Speaker 3>but the guy kissed him on the lips and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he tearing,</v>

1818
01:17:03.161 --> 01:17:06.040
<v Speaker 3>knocked him out cold as they were like </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing the stare down.</v>

1819
01:17:06.340 --> 01:17:08.740
<v Speaker 3>He hit him with a right hook and kit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wash it right here.</v>

1820
01:17:09.290 --> 01:17:11.450
<v Speaker 3>This is a heat herring,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Texas.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1823
01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:17.900
<v Speaker 3>there's standing face to face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He kisses him,</v>

1824
01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:22.790
<v Speaker 3>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kaos him out cold and you lose the fight</v>

1825
01:17:22.791 --> 01:17:24.950
<v Speaker 3>automatically if you hit before the </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

01:17:24.990 --> 01:17:26.960
<v Speaker 3>it's supposed to kiss people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So wait.</v>

01:17:27.020 --> 01:17:32.020
<v Speaker 3>So I don't know if he lost,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Japanese look at things entirely</v>

1828
01:17:32.961 --> 01:17:33.794
<v Speaker 3>differently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Japanese people might've rewarded </v>

1829
01:17:35.091 --> 01:17:37.220
<v Speaker 3>him for this because it's part of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>spectacle.</v>

1830
01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:39.170
<v Speaker 3>It's a spectacle of look at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

1831
01:17:39.171 --> 01:17:40.790

<v Speaker 3>So I was like,</v>

01:17:49.790 --> 01:17:51.980
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said he kissed and I fucking hit him.</v>

<v Speaker 3>greatest of all time.</v>

1854
01:18:28.910 --> 01:18:30.640
<v Speaker 3>Not Probably.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Definitely one of the greatest days.</v>

1855
01:18:30.660 --> 01:18:34.510
<v Speaker 3>Name again fade or a million inco.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's absolutely,</v>

1856
01:18:34.511 --> 01:18:36.620
<v Speaker 3>he's a Russian gentleman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His name is he the,</v>

1857
01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:39.080
<v Speaker 3>in Russia they don't even say Fado.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They say fuel door,</v>

1858
01:18:39.140 --> 01:18:40.400
<v Speaker 3>fuel door,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a million ankle.</v>

1859
01:18:40.401 --> 01:18:42.110
<v Speaker 3>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's spelled in,</v>

1860
01:18:42.210 --> 01:18:44.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously it's English as version.</v>

1861
01:18:44.690 --> 01:18:45.523
<v Speaker 3>The version of the way we spell it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's different than the way they spell </v>

1862
01:18:47.721 --> 01:18:49.370
<v Speaker 3>it because they use different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when did he,</v>

1863
01:18:49.620 --> 01:18:50.810
<v Speaker 3>when did he fight?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1864
01:18:50.811 --> 01:18:51.644
<v Speaker 3>he's still fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just started a fighting again </v>

1865
01:18:53.391 --> 01:18:56.060
<v Speaker 3>recently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just fought and won but looked really</v>

1866
01:18:56.061 --> 01:18:57.140
<v Speaker 3>bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1867
01:18:57.350 --> 01:18:59.930
<v Speaker 3>This is a different fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a different stare down.</v>

1868
01:18:59.931 --> 01:19:02.450
<v Speaker 3>These guys are going to kiss too now I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1869
01:19:02.451 --> 01:19:03.890
<v Speaker 3>he kissed him and the other guy got mad.</v>

1870
01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:05.030
<v Speaker 3>Ooh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't really,</v>

1871
01:19:05.031 --> 01:19:06.830
<v Speaker 3>don't have to keep watching guys get </v>
<v Speaker 3>suddenly.</v>

1872
01:19:07.310 --> 01:19:10.370
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to be known as Wayne </v>
<v Speaker 3>Fetterman just loves guys kissing.</v>

1873
01:19:10.371 --> 01:19:11.204
<v Speaker 3>That's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we'd just so he wouldn't look at </v>

1874
01:19:14.211 --> 01:19:16.010
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He looked down a cause.</v>

1875
01:19:16.011 --> 01:19:17.600
<v Speaker 3>This is a waste of energy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you?</v>

1876
01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:18.900
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>waste of energy.</v>

1877
01:19:18.901 --> 01:19:19.521
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can.</v>

1878
01:19:19.521 --> 01:19:21.440
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you get anxious,</v>

1879
01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:24.310
<v Speaker 3>you get anxious about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a waste of energy.</v>

1880
01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:25.810
<v Speaker 3>Not a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>like intimidation.</v>

1882
01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:30.680
<v Speaker 3>Nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Honestly,</v>

1883
01:19:30.681 --> 01:19:32.330
<v Speaker 3>it's nonsense because you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>

1884
01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:33.193
<v Speaker 3>It's raw.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's already wrapped and then she </v>

1885
01:19:34.290 --> 01:19:35.123
<v Speaker 3>already happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you don't have some guys who are </v>

1886
01:19:36.081 --> 01:19:37.760
<v Speaker 3>really good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some guys,</v>

1887
01:19:37.761 --> 01:19:40.940
<v Speaker 3>like some guy and also some guys would </v>
<v Speaker 3>get angry if other guys were doing it,</v>

1888
01:19:40.941 --> 01:19:42.830
<v Speaker 3>so they would out stare them down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1889
01:19:42.831 --> 01:19:45.590
<v Speaker 3>here's the best stare down of all time </v>
<v Speaker 3>in MMA.</v>

1890
01:19:45.620 --> 01:19:46.730
<v Speaker 3>I'll show you the best steer down.</v>

1891
01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:49.940
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mirko Cro cop versus vandelay Silva.</v>

1892
01:19:49.970 --> 01:19:54.050
<v Speaker 3>This is the best stare down ever because</v>
<v Speaker 3>Vander Ley was,</v>

1893
01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:55.910
<v Speaker 3>they used,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his nickname is the ax murderer.</v>

1894
01:19:56.120 --> 01:19:59.240
<v Speaker 3>He's a fucking savage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a pride middleweight champion.</v>

1895
01:19:59.241 --> 01:20:01.370
<v Speaker 3>Bad motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just a bad mother.</v>

1896
01:20:01.371 --> 01:20:02.204
<v Speaker 3>But he was fighting Mirko Cro cop who </v>
<v Speaker 3>was the head of an antiterrorist </v>

1897
01:20:06.440 --> 01:20:09.810
<v Speaker 3>squadron in Croatia and he's a real </v>
<v Speaker 3>murder.</v>

1898
01:20:10.020 --> 01:20:10.853
<v Speaker 3>This is you talking about a different </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of fucking straight up killer and </v>

1899
01:20:13.860 --> 01:20:17.520
<v Speaker 3>an elite high level kickboxer so look at</v>
<v Speaker 3>cro cop on the left.</v>

1900
01:20:17.550 --> 01:20:18.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I sam C.</v>

1901
01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:19.793
<v Speaker 3>Dot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the eyes of the guy who's killed </v>

1902
01:20:20.701 --> 01:20:21.534
<v Speaker 3>someone with a knife.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See is a fucking completely different </v>

1903
01:20:23.851 --> 01:20:24.684
<v Speaker 3>stare down here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cro gobs looking at him and he's not </v>

1904
01:20:27.481 --> 01:20:28.314
<v Speaker 3>budging.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the first time we're vandelay </v>

1905
01:20:30.121 --> 01:20:34.890
<v Speaker 3>lost a stare down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A vandelay was used to staring guys down</v>

1906
01:20:35.130 --> 01:20:35.963
<v Speaker 3>and they would be intimidated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the Cro cop looked at him like he </v>

1907
01:20:38.731 --> 01:20:40.230
<v Speaker 3>was dinner and Cro.</v>

1908
01:20:40.230 --> 01:20:44.010
<v Speaker 3>Cop wound up head kicking him like </v>
<v Speaker 3>video,</v>

1909
01:20:44.011 --> 01:20:44.810
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pull up,</v>

1910
01:20:44.810 --> 01:20:46.200
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mirko Cro,</v>

1911
01:20:46.201 --> 01:20:49.710
<v Speaker 3>Cop k o vandelay Silva.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can I say on a side note,</v>

1912
01:20:49.711 --> 01:20:52.050
<v Speaker 3>one of the greatest head kick knockouts </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever?</v>

1913
01:20:52.110 --> 01:20:52.741
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to see it.</v>

1914
01:20:52.741 --> 01:20:53.574
<v Speaker 3>But on a side note,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's impressive that you know all these </v>

1915
01:20:55.681 --> 01:20:57.920
<v Speaker 3>guys names.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1916
01:20:57.930 --> 01:20:59.550
<v Speaker 3>it's part of my job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand,</v>

1917
01:20:59.551 --> 01:21:02.480
<v Speaker 3>but it's still like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like they're like friends.</v>

1918
01:21:02.910 --> 01:21:04.820
<v Speaker 3>It's only impressive because you don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>know their names.</v>

1919
01:21:05.130 --> 01:21:07.290
<v Speaker 3>If you were like another mma fan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you blink.</v>

1920
01:21:07.291 --> 01:21:08.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rogan knows those guys names.</v>

1921
01:21:08.930 --> 01:21:12.060
<v Speaker 3>It's as he supposed to know those well </v>
<v Speaker 3>fellow comedian.</v>

1922
01:21:12.061 --> 01:21:12.894
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying it's a break.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've gotta be the only comedian that </v>

1923
01:21:14.671 --> 01:21:17.070
<v Speaker 3>knows all these guys names.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe Adam Hunter.</v>

1924
01:21:17.100 --> 01:21:18.570
<v Speaker 3>He probably would know it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

1925
01:21:18.571 --> 01:21:21.270
<v Speaker 3>he's a big fan anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just probably wouldn't know.</v>

1926
01:21:21.330 --> 01:21:22.620
<v Speaker 3>Maybe as many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1927
01:21:22.621 --> 01:21:23.760
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's impressive.</v>

1928
01:21:23.940 --> 01:21:24.721
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

1929
01:21:24.721 --> 01:21:27.300
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know a lot of sports.</v>

1930
01:21:27.301 --> 01:21:29.790
<v Speaker 3>Like you guys were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>basketball before the show started.</v>

1931
01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:32.160
<v Speaker 3>I don't know Jack Shit about basketball.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1932
01:21:32.161 --> 01:21:32.994
<v Speaker 3>there's a limited amount of data that a </v>
<v Speaker 3>man keeping his head or a woman I'm </v>

1933
01:21:35.580 --> 01:21:36.480
<v Speaker 3>assuming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1934
01:21:36.780 --> 01:21:38.070
<v Speaker 3>And I just don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1935
01:21:38.190 --> 01:21:40.560
<v Speaker 3>I only have so many stats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>

1936
01:21:40.561 --> 01:21:41.330
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My,</v>

1937
01:21:41.330 --> 01:21:44.120
<v Speaker 3>my stats are filled up with I before we </v>
<v Speaker 3>get to this spice.</v>

1938
01:21:44.121 --> 01:21:44.940
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right.</v>

1939
01:21:44.940 --> 01:21:46.440
<v Speaker 3>This is Mirko Cro cop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1940
01:21:46.441 --> 01:21:49.170
<v Speaker 3>this is a slow motion version of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Watch this.</v>

1941
01:21:49.350 --> 01:21:50.183
<v Speaker 3>Ooh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's those two guys that were staring </v>

1942
01:21:52.531 --> 01:21:53.730
<v Speaker 3>each other down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1943
01:21:53.731 --> 01:21:54.564
<v Speaker 3>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1944
01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:57.060
<v Speaker 3>With a stare down is actually from their</v>
<v Speaker 3>first fight.</v>

1945
01:21:57.061 --> 01:21:58.740
<v Speaker 3>The head kick was from their second </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>

1946
01:21:59.820 --> 01:22:02.960
<v Speaker 3>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1947
01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:05.460
<v Speaker 3>stats head kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1948
01:22:05.470 --> 01:22:05.751
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1949
01:22:05.751 --> 01:22:06.584
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

1950
01:22:07.010 --> 01:22:07.843
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

1951
01:22:08.220 --> 01:22:12.150
<v Speaker 3>I was going to ask you of the sports </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you don't follow,</v>

1952
01:22:12.510 --> 01:22:14.730
<v Speaker 3>what are your favorites?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are your least favorites?</v>

1953
01:22:15.690 --> 01:22:17.970
<v Speaker 3>I don't really care about any of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can get them all illegal.</v>

1954
01:22:17.971 --> 01:22:20.280
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't give a fuck baseball,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>

1955
01:22:20.610 --> 01:22:22.080
<v Speaker 3>Waste of time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1956
01:22:22.140 --> 01:22:23.030
<v Speaker 3>Can you just say you're name</v>

1957
01:22:29.230 --> 01:22:30.063
<v Speaker 7>right,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but he forgot to touch the bag that was </v>

1958
01:22:32.651 --> 01:22:34.400
<v Speaker 7>on the ground so it didn't,</v>

1959
01:22:36.250 --> 01:22:39.370
<v Speaker 3>is it because you think that this is the</v>
<v Speaker 3>ultimate sport?</v>

1960
01:22:39.371 --> 01:22:40.820
<v Speaker 3>Because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not,</v>

1961
01:22:40.821 --> 01:22:41.654
<v Speaker 3>it's not the oil down that it's the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ultimate sport because it is boiled </v>

1962
01:22:43.661 --> 01:22:44.494
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is unquestionably the most exciting </v>

1963
01:22:45.551 --> 01:22:46.384
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The two human beings can engage in it </v>

1964
01:22:47.660 --> 01:22:49.780
<v Speaker 3>because it's not a game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a game,</v>

1965
01:22:49.860 --> 01:22:50.693
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Consequence.</v>

1966
01:22:51.070 --> 01:22:55.030
<v Speaker 3>It's high level problem solving with </v>
<v Speaker 3>dire physical consequences.</v>

1967
01:22:55.320 --> 01:22:56.190
<v Speaker 3>That's interest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's really,</v>

1968
01:22:56.200 --> 01:22:57.760
<v Speaker 3>did you come up with that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1969
01:22:57.910 --> 01:22:59.680
<v Speaker 3>That's mine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's pretty good.</v>

1970
01:22:59.770 --> 01:23:00.603
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say it again.</v>

1971
01:23:00.610 --> 01:23:04.820
<v Speaker 3>High level problem solving with dire </v>
<v Speaker 3>physical consequences.</v>

1972
01:23:04.850 --> 01:23:05.880
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1974
01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:07.260
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1975
01:23:07.261 --> 01:23:09.250
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so well I don't even have to get through</v>

1976
01:23:09.251 --> 01:23:10.230
<v Speaker 1>baseball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>soccer,</v>

1977
01:23:10.510 --> 01:23:11.343
<v Speaker 1>the soccer when he is interested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's bunker impression about all of </v>

1978
01:23:13.961 --> 01:23:14.794
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been watching soccer recently </v>

1979
01:23:18.551 --> 01:23:19.384
<v Speaker 1>because I'm friends with Ian Edwards and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a giant soccer fan and he actually </v>

1980
01:23:21.641 --> 01:23:25.210
<v Speaker 1>has a soccer podcast and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's been trying to get me into soccer,</v>

1981
01:23:25.211 --> 01:23:26.950
<v Speaker 1>so we watched a bunch of soccer games </v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

1982
01:23:27.340 --> 01:23:28.570
<v Speaker 1>Matches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fun,</v>

1983
01:23:28.870 --> 01:23:29.703
<v Speaker 1>it's fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when they get smacked accidentally </v>

1984
01:23:32.411 --> 01:23:34.480
<v Speaker 1>and they go down like bitches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1985
01:23:34.481 --> 01:23:35.560
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't.</v>

1986
01:23:35.561 --> 01:23:37.360
<v Speaker 1>It's the worst thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you.</v>

1987
01:23:37.630 --> 01:23:39.430
<v Speaker 1>I looked at him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I looked over at Ian and I'm like,</v>

1988
01:23:39.431 --> 01:23:41.860
<v Speaker 1>I can't support this kind of fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>pussy behavior.</v>

1989
01:23:41.950 --> 01:23:45.430
<v Speaker 1>This is horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I that I agree with you 100%.</v>

1990
01:23:45.431 --> 01:23:47.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's hard to watch.</v>

1991
01:23:47.860 --> 01:23:50.590
<v Speaker 1>That is hard to watch because it's like </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a competitor.</v>

1992
01:23:50.650 --> 01:23:52.780
<v Speaker 1>You're a competitor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's pathetic.</v>

1993
01:23:53.110 --> 01:23:54.670
<v Speaker 1>It's pathetic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You agree with everything.</v>

1994
01:23:54.730 --> 01:23:56.380
<v Speaker 1>Someone knows when someone's smacks him </v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

1995
01:23:56.410 --> 01:23:58.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone knows you could see it.</v>

1996
01:23:58.120 --> 01:24:00.310
<v Speaker 1>They have replaced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to go down like a bitch.</v>

1997
01:24:00.520 --> 01:24:03.340
<v Speaker 1>You have to hold your face and roll </v>
<v Speaker 1>around the ground and agony.</v>

1998
01:24:03.550 --> 01:24:05.260
<v Speaker 1>Especially when you've seen what I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>seen.</v>

1999
01:24:05.261 --> 01:24:07.120
<v Speaker 1>You seen guys get right kneed in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>face,</v>

2000
01:24:07.121 --> 01:24:08.380
<v Speaker 1>like Cyborg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2005
01:24:16.750 --> 01:24:18.850
<v Speaker 1>It's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's an interesting sport.</v>

2006
01:24:18.940 --> 01:24:20.920
<v Speaker 1>It's an interesting sport in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2007
01:24:20.921 --> 01:24:21.754
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some pretty complex strategy </v>

2008
01:24:23.141 --> 01:24:24.280
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of move.</v>

2009
01:24:24.290 --> 01:24:25.123
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember I talked to you about this </v>

2010
01:24:26.141 --> 01:24:26.974
<v Speaker 1>long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a great episode of either CNN </v>

2011
01:24:30.251 --> 01:24:31.084
<v Speaker 1>sports or espn when they brought you on </v>
<v Speaker 1>to talk about how horrible mma was </v>

2012
01:24:35.411 --> 01:24:40.411
<v Speaker 1>compared to boxing and then you in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very skilled manner,</v>

2013
01:24:41.080 --> 01:24:44.080
<v Speaker 1>took apart the interviewer and the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy with a,</v>

2014
01:24:44.081 --> 01:24:44.914
<v Speaker 1>your knowledge boxing and then be </v>
<v Speaker 1>explaining why you thought mma or I </v>

2015
01:24:49.991 --> 01:24:51.880
<v Speaker 1>don't even know if that's the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>transport term,</v>

2016
01:24:52.230 --> 01:24:53.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

2017
01:24:53.711 --> 01:24:54.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the APP,</v>

2018
01:24:54.610 --> 01:24:56.710
<v Speaker 1>the natural evolution of what was going </v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

2019
01:24:57.160 --> 01:24:58.360
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people remember that.</v>

2020
01:24:58.390 --> 01:24:59.440
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you talk to,</v>

2021
01:24:59.460 --> 01:25:00.293
<v Speaker 1>I'm assuming you're talking about that a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot on this podcast are now to talk </v>

2022
01:25:02.411 --> 01:25:03.640
<v Speaker 1>about the difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2023
01:25:03.641 --> 01:25:05.420
<v Speaker 1>that moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2024
01:25:05.421 --> 01:25:06.520
<v Speaker 1>What was it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was it?</v>

2025
01:25:06.550 --> 01:25:08.350
<v Speaker 1>There was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was espn,</v>

2026
01:25:08.410 --> 01:25:09.243
<v Speaker 1>espn you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was the early days of the UFC </v>

2027
01:25:10.691 --> 01:25:12.430
<v Speaker 1>where people didn't accept the UFC and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

2028
01:25:12.700 --> 01:25:15.580
<v Speaker 1>that guy has actually become a ufc fan </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2029
01:25:15.730 --> 01:25:18.400
<v Speaker 1>but I think they had to realize that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's room for everybody.</v>

2030
01:25:18.950 --> 01:25:20.170
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a boxing fan.</v>

2031
01:25:20.171 --> 01:25:22.570
<v Speaker 1>I've always been a boxing fan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of this.</v>

2032
01:25:22.600 --> 01:25:23.920
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2033
01:25:23.980 --> 01:25:24.813
<v Speaker 1>My whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my whole life I've always been a boxing </v>

2034
01:25:26.561 --> 01:25:28.120
<v Speaker 1>fan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can I say something about maxine?</v>

2035
01:25:28.180 --> 01:25:29.013
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whenever I hear the term pound for </v>

2036
01:25:30.011 --> 01:25:31.900
<v Speaker 1>pound,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that term,</v>

2037
01:25:32.050 --> 01:25:33.340
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All I think of,</v>

2038
01:25:33.341 --> 01:25:33.641
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2039
01:25:33.641 --> 01:25:37.300
<v Speaker 1>That's a little guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2040
01:25:37.540 --> 01:25:38.700
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever we're talking about,</v>

2041
01:25:38.701 --> 01:25:39.534
<v Speaker 1>see it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people think it's Jon Jones and </v>

2042
01:25:41.321 --> 01:25:42.630
<v Speaker 1>he's 205 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2043
01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:44.010
<v Speaker 1>he is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2044
01:25:44.530 --> 01:25:45.363
<v Speaker 1>Well he's around two 20 whenever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whenever I hear that term it's always </v>

2045
01:25:47.981 --> 01:25:48.610
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2046
01:25:48.610 --> 01:25:49.443
<v Speaker 1>they're dying little doll because most </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the time during Roy Jones Jr day was </v>

2047
01:25:53.321 --> 01:25:57.160
<v Speaker 1>him and he was a one 75 and he'd won the</v>
<v Speaker 1>heavyweight title.</v>

2048
01:25:57.190 --> 01:26:00.400
<v Speaker 1>He beat John Ruiz at heavyweight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roy Jones Jr.</v>

2049
01:26:00.430 --> 01:26:01.360
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2050
01:26:01.890 --> 01:26:02.723
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2051
01:26:02.860 --> 01:26:04.220
<v Speaker 1>I thought</v>

2052
01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:05.113
<v Speaker 3>super middleweight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is one 68 he won the light </v>

2053
01:26:07.131 --> 01:26:10.340
<v Speaker 3>heavyweight title.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He fought as divisions in mma.</v>

2054
01:26:10.370 --> 01:26:11.860
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Same One,</v>

2055
01:26:11.880 --> 01:26:12.713
<v Speaker 3>same number.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2056
01:26:12.770 --> 01:26:14.330
<v Speaker 3>not the silos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Different numbers.</v>

2057
01:26:14.331 --> 01:26:16.100
<v Speaker 3>Same names.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very confusing.</v>

2058
01:26:16.101 --> 01:26:16.934
<v Speaker 3>Like welterweight welterweight and </v>
<v Speaker 3>boxing is one 47 welterweight and mma </v>

2059
01:26:21.111 --> 01:26:24.680
<v Speaker 3>it's one 70 yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So those guys are just bigger.</v>

2060
01:26:24.950 --> 01:26:28.100
<v Speaker 3>It's just a different name because we </v>
<v Speaker 3>have a one 45 weight class.</v>

2061
01:26:28.101 --> 01:26:29.210
<v Speaker 3>What's it called?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A featherweight.</v>

2062
01:26:30.030 --> 01:26:31.910
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did they have an ultra featherweight?</v>

2063
01:26:31.970 --> 01:26:32.803
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have a bantamweight that mini </v>

2064
01:26:33.801 --> 01:26:34.670
<v Speaker 3>federal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2065
01:26:34.910 --> 01:26:36.530
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have a lightweight,</v>

2066
01:26:36.531 --> 01:26:41.090
<v Speaker 3>which is one 55 which is the small one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>55 in boxing would be super,</v>

2067
01:26:41.330 --> 01:26:42.163
<v Speaker 3>super lightweight or junior middleweight</v>
<v Speaker 3>or super welterweight or junior </v>

2068
01:26:44.721 --> 01:26:46.160
<v Speaker 3>middleweight rather.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>

2069
01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:49.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't have weight classes in Bach,</v>

2070
01:26:49.910 --> 01:26:50.743
<v Speaker 3>in mma rather.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's maybe people think there's too </v>

2071
01:26:52.851 --> 01:26:55.490
<v Speaker 3>many and boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I don't have a problem with it.</v>

2072
01:26:55.520 --> 01:26:58.310
<v Speaker 3>I like the fact there's a lot of weight </v>
<v Speaker 3>classes cause it gives you a lot of guys</v>

2073
01:26:58.311 --> 01:27:00.980
<v Speaker 3>options and it gives guys options for </v>
<v Speaker 3>championship and counters.</v>

2074
01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:04.700
<v Speaker 3>But I think that the UFC could use more </v>
<v Speaker 3>weight classes.</v>

2075
01:27:04.701 --> 01:27:05.534
<v Speaker 3>I think there should be a way class </v>
<v Speaker 3>minimum every 10 pounds cause 10 pounds </v>

2076
01:27:08.510 --> 01:27:12.960
<v Speaker 3>is that there's a big difference between</v>
<v Speaker 3>a one 70 pound guy on one 80 pound guy.</v>

2077
01:27:12.961 --> 01:27:13.794
<v Speaker 3>As far as strengths,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a big difference in what they can </v>

2078
01:27:15.981 --> 01:27:16.814
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How long before from the way in to the </v>

2079
01:27:22.701 --> 01:27:26.090
<v Speaker 3>fight did they have to put on weight?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it used to be 24 hours,</v>

2080
01:27:26.091 --> 01:27:26.924
<v Speaker 3>but now it's quite a bit more because </v>
<v Speaker 3>now that you usually let them start </v>

2081
01:27:29.841 --> 01:27:33.110
<v Speaker 3>early in the morning as early as a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe 8:00</v>

2082
01:27:33.110 --> 01:27:33.943
<v Speaker 3>AM sometimes 10:00</v>
<v Speaker 3>AM so they have from 10 to noon to make </v>

2083
01:27:36.561 --> 01:27:38.640
<v Speaker 3>weight now and the way in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2084
01:27:38.750 --> 01:27:41.780
<v Speaker 3>now when we do the Wayne's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I announced the winds Friday.</v>

2085
01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:42.910
<v Speaker 3>I've always done that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2086
01:27:43.220 --> 01:27:45.770
<v Speaker 3>And I'm now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the official weight.</v>

2087
01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:48.440
<v Speaker 3>It's not the actual way and they don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually get on the scale.</v>

2088
01:27:48.441 --> 01:27:50.900
<v Speaker 3>And then the way in the they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get on the scale.</v>

2089
01:27:50.901 --> 01:27:52.520
<v Speaker 3>It's more for show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of stupid.</v>

2090
01:27:52.521 --> 01:27:54.850
<v Speaker 3>Did they get on a scale at all because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're hurting.</v>

2091
01:27:54.860 --> 01:27:56.600
<v Speaker 3>File already weighed in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've already waited.</v>

2092
01:27:56.601 --> 01:27:57.790
<v Speaker 3>They already waiting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2093
01:27:57.800 --> 01:28:02.800
<v Speaker 3>We probably shouldn't have them stand on</v>
<v Speaker 3>a scale and do this a nonsense.</v>

2094
01:28:03.530 --> 01:28:04.363
<v Speaker 3>It's really kind of foolish and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually going to talk to them about </v>

2095
01:28:06.261 --> 01:28:09.380
<v Speaker 3>maybe coming up with a better solution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need me to send an angry email?</v>

2096
01:28:09.381 --> 01:28:10.214

<v Speaker 3>fetterman account at federal people </v>

<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

2100
01:28:21.771 --> 01:28:22.604
<v Speaker 3>Rod.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is the way in which is like a </v>

2101
01:28:25.761 --> 01:28:27.920
<v Speaker 3>charade when you're drunk off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shiraz.</v>

2102
01:28:29.890 --> 01:28:32.180
<v Speaker 3>This is a total,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure rod.</v>

2103
01:28:33.340 --> 01:28:35.930
<v Speaker 3>God Damn sure Rod.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's going on here?</v>

2104
01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:37.670

<v Speaker 3>You'd be furious.</v>

2105
01:28:37.960 --> 01:28:40.670
<v Speaker 3>Failed Way it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the time.</v>

2106
01:28:40.671 --> 01:28:41.504
<v Speaker 3>What happens to that fight?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They either lose 20% of their purse to </v>

2107
01:28:45.111 --> 01:28:49.460
<v Speaker 3>their opponent and the fight goes on or </v>
<v Speaker 3>they cancel the fight.</v>

2108
01:28:49.610 --> 01:28:52.850
<v Speaker 3>And it depends entirely upon their </v>
<v Speaker 3>opponent's choice.</v>

2109
01:28:53.060 --> 01:28:54.830
<v Speaker 3>Like it doesn't like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a perfect example.</v>

2110
01:28:55.100 --> 01:28:59.880
<v Speaker 3>This past weekend is a guy named Ian </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mccall and he knows his name fighting.</v>

2113
01:29:02.220 --> 01:29:03.210
<v Speaker 1>kidding.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and scoggins was supposed to get down to</v>

2117
01:29:09.511 --> 01:29:13.200
<v Speaker 1>one 25 is a flyweight fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the lightest weight class in the</v>

2118
01:29:13.201 --> 01:29:14.450
<v Speaker 1>UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Flies.</v>

2119
01:29:14.460 --> 01:29:15.510
<v Speaker 1>The lighter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lightest.</v>

2120
01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:17.970
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a straw weight for women,</v>

2121
01:29:18.030 --> 01:29:18.863
<v Speaker 1>which would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just won 15 but there's not assuming </v>

2122
01:29:21.330 --> 01:29:22.880
<v Speaker 1>strawweight division.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Millie.</v>

<v Speaker 1>The name Straw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like literally your pizza Straw.</v>

2125
01:29:30.950 --> 01:29:34.470
<v Speaker 1>I guess he never thought about it flies </v>
<v Speaker 1>better than being strong.</v>

2126
01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:37.400
<v Speaker 1>Is it better to be a fly then straw?</v>

2130
01:29:48.811 --> 01:29:50.190
<v Speaker 1>stations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think about it.</v>

2131
01:29:50.220 --> 01:29:51.840
<v Speaker 1>That's how I think it's strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think of that?</v>

<v Speaker 1>chop it down.</v>

2137
01:30:04.621 --> 01:30:06.660
<v Speaker 1>They roll it up and they feed it to </v>
<v Speaker 1>cows,</v>

2138
01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:07.411
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

2139
01:30:07.411 --> 01:30:11.140
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Hay Bales Charlotte.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It is straw struggle with like there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>little the same.</v>

2141
01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:17.370
<v Speaker 1>Are they the same?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to find out,</v>

2142
01:30:17.430 --> 01:30:18.263
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you always see like wheat in someone's </v>

2143
01:30:19.980 --> 01:30:20.813
<v Speaker 1>teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always think of wheat more is like a </v>

2144
01:30:22.291 --> 01:30:25.410
<v Speaker 1>stock that has little flowers on it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that little,</v>

2145
01:30:25.411 --> 01:30:27.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean straws,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a stock,</v>

2146
01:30:27.300 --> 01:30:29.040
<v Speaker 1>usually a waste product of wheat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2147
01:30:29.041 --> 01:30:29.874
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing I guess that's used </v>

2148
01:30:31.381 --> 01:30:34.770
<v Speaker 1>as a bedding for barnyard animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the waste product.</v>

2149
01:30:34.770 --> 01:30:36.410
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the straws,</v>

2150
01:30:36.420 --> 01:30:37.253
<v Speaker 1>the part that you don't use hay is </v>
<v Speaker 1>typically Alfalfa or grass that is used </v>

2151
01:30:41.341 --> 01:30:43.650
<v Speaker 1>as animal feed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

2152
01:30:44.040 --> 01:30:45.960
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I know cause I strawn.</v>

2153
01:30:45.961 --> 01:30:47.760
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said would you rather be again,</v>

2154
01:30:47.761 --> 01:30:49.300
<v Speaker 1>let's go back to your question that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>pose.</v>

2155
01:30:49.320 --> 01:30:50.280
<v Speaker 1>Fuck about names,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>

2156
01:30:50.790 --> 01:30:52.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Straw fly gives a shit.</v>

2157
01:30:52.650 --> 01:30:53.940
<v Speaker 1>Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think no names.</v>

2158
01:30:54.150 --> 01:30:55.880
<v Speaker 1>I think one or two numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2159
01:30:55.890 --> 01:30:58.470
<v Speaker 1>I agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the 155 pound champion.</v>

2160
01:30:58.471 --> 01:30:59.760
<v Speaker 1>That's what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very clear.</v>

2161
01:30:59.790 --> 01:31:02.220
<v Speaker 1>Everyone will know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like the welter weight.</v>

2162
01:31:02.310 --> 01:31:05.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to fire up a navy senator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>

2163
01:31:05.520 --> 01:31:06.710
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crude heavyweight.</v>

2164
01:31:06.940 --> 01:31:08.520
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's another interesting thing.</v>

2165
01:31:08.580 --> 01:31:09.413
<v Speaker 1>Heavyweight has a weight limit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't be heavier than 265 pounds in </v>

2166
01:31:12.721 --> 01:31:16.500
<v Speaker 1>boxing in the UFC because we don't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>a super heavyweight division.</v>

2167
01:31:16.620 --> 01:31:17.453
<v Speaker 1>We have a heavyweight division,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he goes up to two 65 and that's what's </v>

2168
01:31:19.921 --> 01:31:20.754
<v Speaker 1>sanctioned.</v>

2169
01:31:21.090 --> 01:31:23.780
<v Speaker 1>And then from to 65 on up is super </v>
<v Speaker 1>heavyweight,</v>

2170
01:31:23.790 --> 01:31:28.110
<v Speaker 1>but the UFC does not have and has never </v>
<v Speaker 1>had a super heavyweight division.</v>

2171
01:31:28.140 --> 01:31:29.730
<v Speaker 1>They didn't want to see those guys that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are not,</v>

2172
01:31:29.760 --> 01:31:31.080
<v Speaker 1>just never had it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2173
01:31:31.081 --> 01:31:32.970
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have to be like fat.</v>

2174
01:31:32.971 --> 01:31:33.804
<v Speaker 1>You made the fat gesture and I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They could easily be just giant like </v>

2175
01:31:36.511 --> 01:31:37.580
<v Speaker 1>brock lesnar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>

2177
01:31:39.301 --> 01:31:42.570
<v Speaker 1>he has to dehydrate himself to make the </v>
<v Speaker 1>265 pound weight limit.</v>

2178
01:31:44.160 --> 01:31:45.300
<v Speaker 1>My how much did a little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2197
01:32:26.660 --> 01:32:29.410
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in mma for awhile while boxing,</v>

2198
01:32:30.430 --> 01:32:31.570
<v Speaker 3>kickboxing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hudson,</v>

2199
01:32:31.571 --> 01:32:36.571
<v Speaker 3>some kickboxing fights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So can I go back to your last fight?</v>

2200
01:32:37.870 --> 01:32:38.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

2201
01:32:38.400 --> 01:32:39.233
<v Speaker 3>Cause I'm really curious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just as somebody who's like afraid </v>

2202
01:32:40.871 --> 01:32:41.770
<v Speaker 3>of fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

2203
01:32:41.771 --> 01:32:45.250
<v Speaker 3>and we'll just curious about it like you</v>
<v Speaker 3>get hit,</v>

2204
01:32:46.180 --> 01:32:48.610
<v Speaker 3>did you think you are winning at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time was definitely winning?</v>

2205
01:32:48.630 --> 01:32:49.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>

2206
01:32:49.490 --> 01:32:53.830
<v Speaker 3>you're winning like a short story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I fought three times that day.</v>

2207
01:32:54.190 --> 01:32:56.680
<v Speaker 3>That was part of the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there was two problems.</v>

2208
01:32:57.010 --> 01:33:00.430
<v Speaker 3>One of the problems was that you know </v>
<v Speaker 3>the exact date?</v>

2209
01:33:00.490 --> 01:33:01.690
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

2210
01:33:02.080 --> 01:33:04.810
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the problems was that I was doing</v>

2211
01:33:04.811 --> 01:33:05.644
<v Speaker 3>comedy at the time and I was working </v>
<v Speaker 3>full time and in Boston and it was </v>

2212
01:33:09.581 --> 01:33:10.414
<v Speaker 3>trying to figure out what I was doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>with my life and I was not nearly as </v>

2213
01:33:12.401 --> 01:33:15.940
<v Speaker 3>dedicated as I was to fighting just a </v>
<v Speaker 3>few years before that.</v>

2214
01:33:15.941 --> 01:33:16.774
<v Speaker 3>And I was 21 on my way to 22.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might've been 22 at the time or maybe </v>

2215
01:33:21.011 --> 01:33:25.000
<v Speaker 3>a month or two before it turned 22 and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's when I decided I was done because</v>

2216
01:33:25.001 --> 01:33:26.680
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew I was half assing it.</v>

2217
01:33:27.130 --> 01:33:27.963
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just wasn't training as hard as I was </v>

2218
01:33:30.971 --> 01:33:31.804
<v Speaker 3>just a couple of years ago when I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting and competing and I was </v>

2219
01:33:33.710 --> 01:33:34.543
<v Speaker 3>throwing Massachusetts state champion </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was competing in national </v>

2220
01:33:37.061 --> 01:33:38.560
<v Speaker 3>tournaments and traveling all over the </v>
<v Speaker 3>country,</v>

2221
01:33:38.950 --> 01:33:40.990
<v Speaker 3>I'd realize that it was a dead end.</v>

2222
01:33:41.020 --> 01:33:45.070
<v Speaker 3>And then I had put an incredible amount </v>
<v Speaker 3>of time and effort into something,</v>

2223
01:33:45.071 --> 01:33:48.020
<v Speaker 3>even at its best case scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was no money in it.</v>

2224
01:33:48.910 --> 01:33:52.900
<v Speaker 3>And then I'd go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd also had a problem in that I started</v>

2225
01:33:52.901 --> 01:33:53.734
<v Speaker 3>competing in taekwondo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was a mostly a kicking art and </v>

2226
01:33:57.791 --> 01:34:00.490
<v Speaker 3>very little hand techniques.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I went from taekwondo.</v>

2227
01:34:00.491 --> 01:34:01.324
<v Speaker 3>I started training at a boxing gym and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>realized that I really needed a massive </v>

2228
01:34:04.811 --> 01:34:05.644
<v Speaker 3>amount of work on my hands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I started boxing and I was </v>

2229
01:34:08.261 --> 01:34:11.260
<v Speaker 3>getting beat up a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I was,</v>

2230
01:34:11.261 --> 01:34:14.350
<v Speaker 3>I was having wars in the gym and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't always winning.</v>

2231
01:34:14.770 --> 01:34:16.110
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was kidding.</v>

2232
01:34:16.120 --> 01:34:19.870
<v Speaker 3>We just slid down in these wars you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>having and you're getting beat up,</v>

2233
01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:22.150
<v Speaker 3>just beat up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're getting beat.</v>

2234
01:34:22.220 --> 01:34:23.610
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get punched in the face,</v>

2235
01:34:23.611 --> 01:34:26.170
<v Speaker 3>you're getting punched in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we all know that great Tyson thing.</v>

2236
01:34:26.170 --> 01:34:28.960
<v Speaker 3>Everyone has a plan until someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>punching in the face.</v>

2237
01:34:29.450 --> 01:34:33.460
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what's going through your head?</v>

2238
01:34:33.461 --> 01:34:35.180
<v Speaker 3>Is it just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>keep moving,</v>

2239
01:34:35.320 --> 01:34:37.210
<v Speaker 3>Throw Your Jab,</v>
<v Speaker 3>move your head,</v>

2240
01:34:37.211 --> 01:34:39.460
<v Speaker 3>don't get hit as much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Move your feet,</v>

2241
01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:42.280
<v Speaker 3>use your foot work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't stand in the pocket.</v>

2242
01:34:42.810 --> 01:34:44.410
<v Speaker 3>Tees up all technique.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2243
01:34:44.411 --> 01:34:45.340
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're sparring.</v>

2244
01:34:45.430 --> 01:34:47.140
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I was doing was I was,</v>

2245
01:34:47.310 --> 01:34:50.350
<v Speaker 3>there was a guy named Joe Lake who was </v>
<v Speaker 3>my boxing coach who was a,</v>

2246
01:34:50.650 --> 01:34:51.483
<v Speaker 3>this is what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was working at this place called </v>

2247
01:34:53.891 --> 01:34:56.440
<v Speaker 3>Nautilus plus in revere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Massachusetts.</v>

2248
01:34:56.441 --> 01:34:59.810
<v Speaker 3>They had this section of this gym that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we had rented out,</v>

2249
01:34:59.870 --> 01:35:02.210
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This big room that we had rented out.</v>

2250
01:35:02.211 --> 01:35:04.700
<v Speaker 3>And I had started teaching taekwondo </v>
<v Speaker 3>classes there.</v>

2251
01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:05.953
<v Speaker 3>And so I would go out and put out flyers</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I would teach classes and I also </v>

2252
01:35:08.571 --> 01:35:13.340
<v Speaker 3>taught at Boston University.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had my own classes at bu and flyered.</v>

2253
01:35:13.560 --> 01:35:14.510

<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

<v Speaker 3>eighties starting out and I had to put </v>
<v Speaker 3>up flyers,</v>

<v Speaker 3>We were having a pretty good time here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>weren't we?</v>

2287
01:36:30.120 --> 01:36:32.330
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I'm attacking me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you're super sensitive.</v>

2288
01:36:32.420 --> 01:36:34.540
<v Speaker 3>I am.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am a sensitive guy.</v>

2289
01:36:34.950 --> 01:36:37.170
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

<v Speaker 3>but not an individual like this.</v>

2294
01:36:46.460 --> 01:36:48.500
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I didn't like about teams.</v>

2295
01:36:48.670 --> 01:36:49.503
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't like the idea that we all one </v>

2296
01:36:51.231 --> 01:36:53.060
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was very selfish.</v>

2297
01:36:53.330 --> 01:36:56.540
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to win and I didn't also like </v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea that we lost,</v>

2298
01:36:56.541 --> 01:37:01.541
<v Speaker 3>cause bobby dropped the ball and now I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>a loser because bobby's a fucking Klutz.</v>

2299
01:37:01.731 --> 01:37:03.460
<v Speaker 3>I'm a loser like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2300
01:37:04.250 --> 01:37:06.050
<v Speaker 3>So why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I went from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm teaching,</v>

2302
01:37:08.450 --> 01:37:10.250
<v Speaker 3>I was teaching at this class and this </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy,</v>

2303
01:37:10.280 --> 01:37:12.680
<v Speaker 3>Joe Lake was a friend of mine who was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>boxer.</v>

2304
01:37:12.840 --> 01:37:15.170
<v Speaker 3>He was a professional boxer and his </v>
<v Speaker 3>boxing coach,</v>

2305
01:37:15.171 --> 01:37:17.420
<v Speaker 3>he taught a lot of pro boxers in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>area.</v>

2306
01:37:17.840 --> 01:37:18.673
<v Speaker 3>He came in and was watching me work out </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he wanted to learn some kicks and </v>

2307
01:37:22.911 --> 01:37:25.250
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we started talking and found out I was a</v>

2308
01:37:25.251 --> 01:37:26.084
<v Speaker 3>boxing fan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We started talking about boxing and he </v>

2309
01:37:28.280 --> 01:37:30.710
<v Speaker 3>told me what he does and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2310
01:37:30.711 --> 01:37:31.191
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

2311
01:37:31.191 --> 01:37:32.250
<v Speaker 3>how about we make a deal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2312
01:37:32.270 --> 01:37:33.103
<v Speaker 3>teach you some boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you teach me some kicking and I'm </v>

2313
01:37:34.461 --> 01:37:35.294
<v Speaker 3>sending it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>love it.</v>

2314
01:37:35.390 --> 01:37:36.223
<v Speaker 3>So when I started learning from him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a great coach and teach me boxing </v>

2315
01:37:39.711 --> 01:37:40.544
<v Speaker 3>techniques and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started realizing how little I knew </v>

2316
01:37:43.401 --> 01:37:44.234
<v Speaker 3>about combining boxing and kicking </v>
<v Speaker 3>together and also how little I knew </v>

2317
01:37:48.081 --> 01:37:48.914
<v Speaker 3>about really like getting hit and </v>
<v Speaker 3>rolling with punches and I just was </v>

2318
01:37:52.071 --> 01:37:53.960
<v Speaker 3>missing that aspect of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

2319
01:37:54.200 --> 01:37:55.033
<v Speaker 3>of fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I started doing it and as I started </v>

2320
01:37:57.961 --> 01:37:58.830
<v Speaker 3>doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2321
01:37:58.920 --> 01:38:02.460
<v Speaker 3>and I competed and I started doing a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>of sparring,</v>

2322
01:38:02.820 --> 01:38:03.653
<v Speaker 3>I started realizing that what I </v>
<v Speaker 3>dedicated all my time to taekwondo was </v>

2323
01:38:06.691 --> 01:38:07.524
<v Speaker 3>limited in a lot of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like without learning how to throw </v>

2324
01:38:09.541 --> 01:38:11.280
<v Speaker 3>punches,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like a real problem with it.</v>

2325
01:38:11.281 --> 01:38:15.450
<v Speaker 3>So I kind of knew that I was not going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to compete in taekwondo anymore.</v>

2326
01:38:15.510 --> 01:38:16.650
<v Speaker 3>I kind of knew like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

2327
01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:17.633
<v Speaker 3>this is sort of opened up my eyes to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>fact that taekwondo is very limited and </v>

2328
01:38:21.241 --> 01:38:22.620
<v Speaker 3>there was no mma back then.</v>

2329
01:38:22.620 --> 01:38:25.920
<v Speaker 3>So like taekwondo you see in mma a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was no,</v>

2330
01:38:25.980 --> 01:38:27.600
<v Speaker 3>I'm not very happy with everything </v>
<v Speaker 3>turned the way,</v>

2331
01:38:27.610 --> 01:38:29.430
<v Speaker 3>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm just like,</v>

2332
01:38:29.460 --> 01:38:29.790
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2333
01:38:29.790 --> 01:38:31.920
<v Speaker 3>no to tiff tested yourself and that kind</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

2334
01:38:31.980 --> 01:38:32.813
<v Speaker 3>I would have for sure 100%,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like I would have definitely done </v>

2335
01:38:35.731 --> 01:38:36.780
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2336
01:38:36.810 --> 01:38:39.150
<v Speaker 3>I did kickboxing because I wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 3>find out about that.</v>

2337
01:38:39.151 --> 01:38:41.400
<v Speaker 3>I did taekwondo because I wanted to find</v>
<v Speaker 3>out about that.</v>

2338
01:38:41.730 --> 01:38:44.100
<v Speaker 3>I fought in karate tournaments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did a lot of different stuff because I</v>

2339
01:38:44.101 --> 01:38:46.100
<v Speaker 3>just wanted to see what it was like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2340
01:38:46.230 --> 01:38:49.680
<v Speaker 3>but if mma was around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would have realized that,</v>

2341
01:38:49.681 --> 01:38:51.600
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all this stuff is all fine and dandy,</v>

2342
01:38:51.601 --> 01:38:52.434
<v Speaker 3>all this kicking and punching.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if somebody takes you down and then </v>

2343
01:38:53.611 --> 01:38:55.470
<v Speaker 3>when are you going to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would've realized then,</v>

2344
01:38:55.471 --> 01:38:57.750
<v Speaker 3>and that's one of the reasons why when I</v>
<v Speaker 3>came to La,</v>

2345
01:38:57.990 --> 01:38:59.550
<v Speaker 3>I immediately got into Jujitsu.</v>

2346
01:38:59.940 --> 01:39:00.773
<v Speaker 3>So I started taking Jujitsu in 1996 and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the reason why I started taking it was </v>

2347
01:39:03.601 --> 01:39:07.120
<v Speaker 3>because of watching the UFC and seeing </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys take guys the ground,</v>

2348
01:39:07.121 --> 01:39:10.140
<v Speaker 3>seeing hoists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gracie dominate guys and try to come and</v>

2349
01:39:10.141 --> 01:39:11.520
<v Speaker 3>tap them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I realized,</v>

2350
01:39:11.550 --> 01:39:12.091
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2351
01:39:12.091 --> 01:39:14.550
<v Speaker 3>I got to learn this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is some totally different stuff.</v>

2352
01:39:14.580 --> 01:39:15.413
<v Speaker 3>And I kind of caught the wave,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I got into it as a traditional </v>

2353
01:39:19.471 --> 01:39:20.304
<v Speaker 3>martial artists as a taekwondo </v>
<v Speaker 3>practitioner and then went from that </v>

2354
01:39:22.921 --> 01:39:27.780
<v Speaker 3>into all these other martial arts that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>had kind of like sort of assimilated and</v>

2355
01:39:27.781 --> 01:39:28.614
<v Speaker 3>plus I was a big Bruce Lee fan and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>was one of the things that Bruce Lee </v>

2356
01:39:31.531 --> 01:39:33.400
<v Speaker 3>subscribed to [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was the,</v>

2357
01:39:33.690 --> 01:39:34.523
<v Speaker 3>he was the first proponent of mixing and</v>
<v Speaker 3>integrating different styles together </v>

2358
01:39:38.160 --> 01:39:38.993
<v Speaker 3>and his g coon dos style was that it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>entirely the philosophy as a style </v>

2359
01:39:44.050 --> 01:39:47.400
<v Speaker 3>absorb what's useful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take all the useful aspects of different</v>

2360
01:39:47.401 --> 01:39:48.600
<v Speaker 3>martial arts and apply them.</v>

2361
01:39:48.820 --> 01:39:51.480
<v Speaker 3>I saw like that could almost apply to </v>
<v Speaker 3>bigger things in life.</v>

2362
01:39:51.570 --> 01:39:52.530
<v Speaker 3>Oh for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>

2363
01:39:52.531 --> 01:39:53.364
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and also the limitations of not doing </v>

2364
01:39:55.021 --> 01:40:00.021
<v Speaker 3>that apply the limitations of being very</v>
<v Speaker 3>rigid idea in your life.</v>

2365
01:40:01.260 --> 01:40:02.130
<v Speaker 3>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2366
01:40:02.131 --> 01:40:02.964
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because this is a lot of people that </v>

2367
01:40:03.691 --> 01:40:04.680
<v Speaker 3>want to think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2368
01:40:04.681 --> 01:40:08.400
<v Speaker 3>what they do is the only way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like people that are on like windows for</v>

2369
01:40:08.401 --> 01:40:09.800
<v Speaker 3>instance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people are just like,</v>

2370
01:40:09.830 --> 01:40:11.730
<v Speaker 3>I'll never use it back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

2371
01:40:11.731 --> 01:40:12.960
<v Speaker 3>Or there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's people that are,</v>

2372
01:40:12.961 --> 01:40:14.490
<v Speaker 3>I'm a Democrat till I die,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bro.</v>

2373
01:40:14.790 --> 01:40:16.080
<v Speaker 3>Oh fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A registered Democrat.</v>

2374
01:40:16.081 --> 01:40:16.914
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of people that will get </v>

2375
01:40:17.491 --> 01:40:19.650
<v Speaker 3>real rigid with their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the evidence,</v>

2376
01:40:19.800 --> 01:40:21.900
<v Speaker 3>no matter exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>information comes their way,</v>

2377
01:40:21.901 --> 01:40:23.190
<v Speaker 3>not interested.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2378
01:40:23.410 --> 01:40:24.243
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dan to that applies because there was a </v>

2379
01:40:26.221 --> 01:40:27.054
<v Speaker 3>lot of blowback or a lot of push back </v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was doing taekwondo and then I </v>

2380
01:40:30.481 --> 01:40:33.870
<v Speaker 3>started boxing when I started really </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting involved in boxing.</v>

2381
01:40:33.871 --> 01:40:34.704
<v Speaker 3>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were people that didn't want you </v>

2382
01:40:35.311 --> 01:40:36.360
<v Speaker 3>to do it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

2383
01:40:36.420 --> 01:40:38.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've felt like it was an argument.</v>

2384
01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:40.350
<v Speaker 3>I didn't need to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was wasting my time.</v>

2385
01:40:40.351 --> 01:40:42.600
<v Speaker 3>I was taking away time from my taekwondo</v>
<v Speaker 3>training.</v>

2386
01:40:42.630 --> 01:40:44.810
<v Speaker 3>It was a waste.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a,</v>

2387
01:40:44.850 --> 01:40:45.683
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that helped me is that</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started opening up my own school and </v>

2388
01:40:47.851 --> 01:40:49.590
<v Speaker 3>when I opened up my own school in </v>
<v Speaker 3>revere,</v>

2389
01:40:49.810 --> 01:40:51.870
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was away from my instructors.</v>

2390
01:40:51.900 --> 01:40:54.250
<v Speaker 3>So I got a chance to train on my own</v>

2391
01:40:54.430 --> 01:40:56.230
<v Speaker 1>and I'd got a chance to bring in other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

2392
01:40:56.320 --> 01:40:57.153
<v Speaker 1>And that's when I really started to </v>
<v Speaker 1>expand my ideas about what I needed to </v>

2393
01:40:59.741 --> 01:41:00.470
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

2394
01:41:00.470 --> 01:41:03.670
<v Speaker 1>what was and what wasn't effective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I had a good buddy of mine who would</v>

2395
01:41:03.671 --> 01:41:05.890
<v Speaker 1>also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my friend Mike [inaudible] who had had a</v>

2396
01:41:05.891 --> 01:41:09.250
<v Speaker 1>some pro boxing fights and we did some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sparring together and he beat me up too.</v>

2397
01:41:09.700 --> 01:41:11.530
<v Speaker 1>And so I kind of realized like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>

2398
01:41:11.531 --> 01:41:12.920
<v Speaker 1>I got to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some stuff I need,</v>

2399
01:41:12.940 --> 01:41:16.960
<v Speaker 1>I need to figure out how to incorporate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's the,</v>

2400
01:41:17.290 --> 01:41:19.390
<v Speaker 1>well first of all brings up a million </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>

2401
01:41:19.391 --> 01:41:22.450
<v Speaker 1>But back to my original question about </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting beat up,</v>

2402
01:41:23.280 --> 01:41:28.280
<v Speaker 1>like just as someone who has the flight </v>
<v Speaker 1>reflex right when someone's coming at me</v>

2403
01:41:30.280 --> 01:41:32.990
<v Speaker 1>like that's my reflex as opposed to oh </v>
<v Speaker 1>brush it off,</v>

2404
01:41:33.010 --> 01:41:35.620
<v Speaker 1>move lane fleet and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm always does that,</v>

2405
01:41:35.740 --> 01:41:38.770
<v Speaker 1>did that ever appear where you're just </v>
<v Speaker 1>like fuck,</v>

2406
01:41:38.800 --> 01:41:39.633
<v Speaker 1>I got a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting pummeled while I was never </v>

2407
01:41:42.131 --> 01:41:42.570
<v Speaker 1>getting pumped.</v>

2408
01:41:42.570 --> 01:41:45.730
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm to just talking them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like emotionally wasn't no,</v>

2409
01:41:45.760 --> 01:41:47.440
<v Speaker 1>cause it wasn't like I didn't have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>chance.</v>

2410
01:41:47.441 --> 01:41:49.990
<v Speaker 1>It was like I was just losing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't winning.</v>

2411
01:41:50.050 --> 01:41:50.883
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

2412
01:41:50.890 --> 01:41:51.723
<v Speaker 1>but I was getting shots in like there </v>
<v Speaker 1>was guys that were pro boxers that I </v>

2413
01:41:54.131 --> 01:41:56.500
<v Speaker 1>knocked out in the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it wasn't that I was,</v>

2414
01:41:56.740 --> 01:41:57.573
<v Speaker 1>I gadget 100% losing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I definitely wasn't winning like I </v>

2415
01:41:59.801 --> 01:42:02.170
<v Speaker 1>was winning and taekwondo tournament's </v>
<v Speaker 1>in taekwondo.</v>

2416
01:42:02.230 --> 01:42:05.710
<v Speaker 1>Was that a real national class level?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I must like I was beating.</v>

2417
01:42:05.711 --> 01:42:06.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's the problem.</v>

2418
01:42:06.941 --> 01:42:08.530
<v Speaker 1>When you're really good at something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to stick to.</v>

2419
01:42:08.531 --> 01:42:09.364
<v Speaker 1>Only that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't want to test the waters with </v>

2420
01:42:12.221 --> 01:42:14.690
<v Speaker 1>things that you're not good at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know in a weird way.</v>

2421
01:42:14.691 --> 01:42:16.870
<v Speaker 1>Horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can I draw a parallel to stand up?</v>

2422
01:42:16.990 --> 01:42:19.480
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

2479
01:44:17.080 --> 01:44:17.913
<v Speaker 1>We'll move onto another thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's part of the hot yoga to lose </v>

2480
01:44:23.151 --> 01:44:24.000
<v Speaker 1>weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's all just for the just exercise.</v>

2484
01:44:28.850 --> 01:44:29.480
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2485
01:44:29.480 --> 01:44:31.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean you definitely will lose weight </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you do it.</v>

2486
01:44:31.491 --> 01:44:34.820
<v Speaker 1>It's 90 minutes of exertion is a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>calories being burned for sure.</v>

2487
01:44:34.850 --> 01:44:36.920
<v Speaker 1>How hot is it in there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>104 degrees,</v>

2488
01:44:37.100 --> 01:44:37.933
<v Speaker 1>but it's also 104 degrees and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're exercising and there's 50 other </v>

2489
01:44:40.491 --> 01:44:43.040
<v Speaker 1>people in the room and they're all </v>
<v Speaker 1>sweating like pigs smell good.</v>

2490
01:44:43.041 --> 01:44:44.130
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking hot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nuts.</v>

2491
01:44:44.160 --> 01:44:46.460
<v Speaker 1>Smells terrible sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that the hardest part?</v>

2492
01:44:46.490 --> 01:44:47.301
<v Speaker 1>No smell?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2493
01:44:47.301 --> 01:44:49.190
<v Speaker 1>The hardest part is mental.</v>

2494
01:44:49.520 --> 01:44:50.660
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the hardest part.</v>

2495
01:44:50.980 --> 01:44:53.060

<v Speaker 1>it never is going to be easy.</v>

2496
01:44:53.120 --> 01:44:53.953
<v Speaker 1>You will always put a hundred percent </v>
<v Speaker 1>effort into each and every individual </v>

2497
01:44:57.771 --> 01:44:58.604
<v Speaker 1>posts so it will never know less.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will never be less than a hundred </v>

2498
01:45:01.971 --> 01:45:04.520
<v Speaker 1>percent effort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it will always be difficult.</v>

2499
01:45:04.580 --> 01:45:07.220
<v Speaker 1>You will get better and maintaining </v>
<v Speaker 1>those poses,</v>

2500
01:45:07.221 --> 01:45:09.050
<v Speaker 1>you will get better at your range of </v>
<v Speaker 1>motion.</v>

<v Speaker 1>hold positions,</v>

2502
01:45:12.140 --> 01:45:14.840
<v Speaker 1>but it will never be easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always going to be hard.</v>

<v Speaker 1>So how did it start?</v>

2566
01:47:47.700 --> 01:47:52.700
<v Speaker 1>So Nike's people made a piano and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>put it on a stage and a microphone there</v>

2567
01:47:52.861 --> 01:47:55.380
<v Speaker 1>and the comics were constantly annoyed </v>
<v Speaker 1>by that fucking piano.</v>

2568
01:47:55.410 --> 01:47:56.243
<v Speaker 1>Not True.</v>

2569
01:47:58.561 --> 01:48:01.710
<v Speaker 1>coming in and doing show tunes after </v>
<v Speaker 1>their shows and people would hang out.</v>

2570
01:48:01.950 --> 01:48:02.783
<v Speaker 1>And guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll you know how the south started </v>

2571
01:48:03.721 --> 01:48:05.370
<v Speaker 1>slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should we go back to that?</v>

2572
01:48:05.810 --> 01:48:08.370
<v Speaker 1>Jesus went quading a piano.</v>

2573

<v Speaker 1>instrument form.</v>

2575
01:48:14.220 --> 01:48:17.820
<v Speaker 1>What if it only plays Leonard scanners </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the piano?</v>

<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2655
01:51:39.820 --> 01:51:44.530
<v Speaker 2>in Florida there's gambling arena and in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Florida it's called high lie.</v>

2656
01:51:44.950 --> 01:51:46.120
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of those things.</v>

2657
01:51:46.121 --> 01:51:47.530
<v Speaker 2>You ever heard of it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2658
01:51:47.531 --> 01:51:49.880
<v Speaker 2>I seen that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did they still have that?</v>

2659
01:51:49.910 --> 01:51:50.743
<v Speaker 2>I think that little tube to like when </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are walking their dogs and they </v>

2660
01:51:54.011 --> 01:51:55.900
<v Speaker 2>throw the ball,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what it looks like.</v>

2661
01:51:56.020 --> 01:51:56.680
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2662
01:51:56.680 --> 01:51:58.830
<v Speaker 2>they have like a highlight stick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They throw the ball for dog.</v>

2663
01:51:58.890 --> 01:51:59.723
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2664
01:52:00.080 --> 01:52:00.490
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2665
01:52:00.490 --> 01:52:03.370
<v Speaker 2>People that have bad rotator cuffs and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they can't really throw a ball.</v>

2666
01:52:03.790 --> 01:52:04.780
<v Speaker 2>That's sad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2667
01:52:05.060 --> 01:52:07.900
<v Speaker 2>I can't throw a ball.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's looks just like that.</v>

2668
01:52:07.960 --> 01:52:08.793
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the few sports in the world </v>

2669
01:52:10.691 --> 01:52:13.420
<v Speaker 2>where you can't be lefthanded and play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

2670
01:52:13.480 --> 01:52:14.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause there's a wall.</v>

2671
01:52:16.300 --> 01:52:16.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

2672
01:52:16.730 --> 01:52:19.030
<v Speaker 2>They throw it against the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can only be writing one of the few.</v>

2673
01:52:20.020 --> 01:52:22.210
<v Speaker 2>And they used to call it the fastest </v>
<v Speaker 2>sport in the world.</v>

2674
01:52:22.240 --> 01:52:25.000
<v Speaker 2>And then guess who made them take that </v>
<v Speaker 2>moniker away?</v>

2675
01:52:25.001 --> 01:52:26.650
<v Speaker 2>That was one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The kid was like the fast cars,</v>

2676
01:52:26.651 --> 01:52:28.570
<v Speaker 2>they would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know who whipped that thing?</v>

2677
01:52:28.850 --> 01:52:30.910
<v Speaker 2>Golf.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the golfers say?</v>

2678
01:52:30.911 --> 01:52:33.910
<v Speaker 2>The ball travels faster when you hit her</v>
<v Speaker 2>off fatigue and it's true.</v>

2679
01:52:34.870 --> 01:52:37.120
<v Speaker 2>So they made him take you down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He made them.</v>

2680
01:52:37.121 --> 01:52:40.330
<v Speaker 2>They like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all on a sports course.</v>

2681
01:52:40.990 --> 01:52:42.550
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to use weird.</v>

2682
01:52:42.551 --> 01:52:45.720
<v Speaker 2>So I graduated high school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is</v>

2683
01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:46.873
<v Speaker 1>an I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talk about this on stage south </v>

2684
01:52:48.111 --> 01:52:49.160
<v Speaker 1>plantation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hi.</v>

2685
01:52:49.220 --> 01:52:51.290
<v Speaker 1>Let's watch some of this or this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2686
01:52:51.291 --> 01:52:54.500
<v Speaker 1>so it bounces off the wall and then they</v>
<v Speaker 1>throw it and they catch it.</v>

2687
01:52:55.010 --> 01:52:57.110
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you were left handed,</v>

2688
01:52:57.111 --> 01:52:58.640
<v Speaker 1>the wall would be in the way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2689
01:52:58.940 --> 01:53:00.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would the wall be in the way?</v>

2690
01:53:00.760 --> 01:53:03.560
<v Speaker 1>Cause you would smash her arm at Beth </v>
<v Speaker 1>can against the wall.</v>

2691
01:53:04.540 --> 01:53:06.320
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're on the right side.</v>

2692
01:53:06.600 --> 01:53:07.433
<v Speaker 1>It's only one wall or on the right side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right there is where I'm going in a way </v>

2693
01:53:11.270 --> 01:53:13.240
<v Speaker 1>that's dumb as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could have a left hand in one.</v>

2694
01:53:13.241 --> 01:53:14.390
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These guys are idiots.</v>

2695
01:53:17.510 --> 01:53:21.200
<v Speaker 1>Rogan takes down the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go to the left and the right.</v>

2696
01:53:21.230 --> 01:53:23.090
<v Speaker 1>If you can go to the left and the right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes no sense.</v>

2697
01:53:23.150 --> 01:53:28.150
<v Speaker 1>There's a net on the right where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience is and then the the wall on the</v>

2698
01:53:29.331 --> 01:53:30.164
<v Speaker 1>left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2699
01:53:30.710 --> 01:53:31.610
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>

2700
01:53:31.611 --> 01:53:34.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I might be wrong about this.</v>

2701
01:53:34.851 --> 01:53:36.380
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been wrong about a lot of things in</v>

2702
01:53:36.381 --> 01:53:38.270
<v Speaker 1>life as you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you know,</v>

2703
01:53:38.390 --> 01:53:43.310
<v Speaker 1>I grew up hearing that that was fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That highlight was fixed.</v>

2704
01:53:43.400 --> 01:53:44.233
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>

2705
01:53:44.280 --> 01:53:45.140
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait.</v>

2706
01:53:45.141 --> 01:53:48.680
<v Speaker 1>You're saying like a fixed like fake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they cheat.</v>

2707
01:53:48.800 --> 01:53:49.633
<v Speaker 1>I would assume it would be the easiest </v>
<v Speaker 1>of all the sports to fix because we get </v>

2708
01:53:53.731 --> 01:53:56.420
<v Speaker 1>that wire left in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's forbidden to play.</v>

2709
01:53:56.500 --> 01:53:57.440
<v Speaker 1>Highlight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2710
01:53:57.980 --> 01:53:58.813
<v Speaker 1>How many walls are there in highligh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lefthanders can play highlight as long </v>

2711
01:54:02.481 --> 01:54:04.040
<v Speaker 1>as are willing to use their right hand.</v>

2712
01:54:06.560 --> 01:54:09.350
<v Speaker 1>Your right stay correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just reading this man.</v>

2713
01:54:09.650 --> 01:54:13.250
<v Speaker 1>The rules and traditions specifically </v>
<v Speaker 1>forbid playing lefthand did.</v>

2714
01:54:13.251 --> 01:54:14.084
<v Speaker 1>The reason for that is that the court </v>
<v Speaker 1>only has three walls and one at each </v>

2715
01:54:18.321 --> 01:54:19.154
<v Speaker 1>end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One the sidewall and one the left </v>

2716
01:54:20.391 --> 01:54:21.224
<v Speaker 1>against which the ball can be rebounded </v>
<v Speaker 1>spectators it behind a chain link fence </v>

2717
01:54:25.731 --> 01:54:27.710
<v Speaker 1>and the fourth side because of the side </v>
<v Speaker 1>wall on the left.</v>

2718
01:54:28.040 --> 01:54:28.873
<v Speaker 1>It would be dangerous and almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>impossible for players to throw and </v>

2719
01:54:31.431 --> 01:54:33.300
<v Speaker 1>catch with their left hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

2720
01:54:33.380 --> 01:54:34.400
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2721
01:54:34.490 --> 01:54:37.040
<v Speaker 1>Makes Sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that fucking game though.</v>

2722
01:54:37.620 --> 01:54:39.170
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But is it,</v>

2723
01:54:39.890 --> 01:54:41.990
<v Speaker 1>is it the only reason I'm bringing it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

2724
01:54:41.991 --> 01:54:42.824
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure at least one of the eight </v>

2725
01:54:45.260 --> 01:54:48.200
<v Speaker 1>matches that happen or the 10 matches is</v>
<v Speaker 1>fixed,</v>

2726
01:54:48.230 --> 01:54:49.063
<v Speaker 1>which is why it's a gambling sport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like as soon as you get gambling </v>

2727
01:54:51.051 --> 01:54:53.600
<v Speaker 1>involved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would assume it would be the easiest.</v>

2728
01:54:53.630 --> 01:54:54.463
<v Speaker 1>Literally you look at the Guy and wink </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he drops the ball and they lose </v>

2729
01:54:57.771 --> 01:54:58.604
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be the easiest as opposed to a </v>

2730
01:55:00.261 --> 01:55:03.890
<v Speaker 1>horse might be a little more difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the reason I bring it up,</v>

2731
01:55:04.430 --> 01:55:06.740
<v Speaker 1>not be telling you my knowledge of </v>
<v Speaker 1>highline.</v>

2732
01:55:07.850 --> 01:55:10.580
<v Speaker 1>I graduated in a highlife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ron Taiwan,</v>

2733
01:55:11.150 --> 01:55:13.310
<v Speaker 1>it's called a Fontan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say it again.</v>

2734
01:55:13.460 --> 01:55:17.060
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] you got it right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're nailing it.</v>

2735
01:55:17.061 --> 01:55:20.750
<v Speaker 1>What was that like is saying Florida is </v>
<v Speaker 1>insane.</v>

2736
01:55:21.650 --> 01:55:22.483
<v Speaker 1>That's my boy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why he got out of there three </v>

2737
01:55:24.261 --> 01:55:26.120
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A audience and this day,</v>

2738
01:55:26.200 --> 01:55:27.160
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing.</v>

2739
01:55:27.190 --> 01:55:28.100
<v Speaker 1>Parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>families.</v>

2740
01:55:28.101 --> 01:55:28.934
<v Speaker 1>And then he goes down in the arena.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're on the floor on the full on the </v>

2741
01:55:32.481 --> 01:55:33.530
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the three,</v>

2742
01:55:33.740 --> 01:55:34.573
<v Speaker 1>the three walls around you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And literally there's like the bedding </v>

2743
01:55:36.771 --> 01:55:39.760
<v Speaker 1>boards are on both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like the Quinoa,</v>

2744
01:55:39.830 --> 01:55:40.663
<v Speaker 1>the tribe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2745
01:55:41.270 --> 01:55:44.310
<v Speaker 1>that's like the worst possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Classic Florida.</v>

2746
01:55:44.610 --> 01:55:45.443
<v Speaker 2>That was Florida and that was Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I got out of there and then went to </v>

2747
01:55:48.871 --> 01:55:53.250
<v Speaker 2>New York and went to Nyu drama and just </v>
<v Speaker 2>the boring kind of like normal.</v>

2748
01:55:53.850 --> 01:55:54.900
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2749
01:55:54.930 --> 01:55:58.140
<v Speaker 2>And then started my stand at catching </v>
<v Speaker 2>the comic strip or my two clubs.</v>

2750
01:55:58.590 --> 01:55:59.970
<v Speaker 2>I remember those places.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2751
01:55:59.971 --> 01:56:04.971
<v Speaker 2>So I have recordings from those all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way up to 2015 was the last one on here.</v>

2752
01:56:06.540 --> 01:56:09.300
<v Speaker 2>So that's bad ass dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a whole thing.</v>

2753
01:56:09.301 --> 01:56:10.134
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2754
01:56:10.200 --> 01:56:10.921
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2755
01:56:10.921 --> 01:56:11.754
<v Speaker 2>I've never had a comedy album before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so not that I want this whole thing to </v>

2756
01:56:14.641 --> 01:56:15.990
<v Speaker 2>be about the comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

2757
01:56:15.991 --> 01:56:16.824
<v Speaker 2>but that's Wayne and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who should tell everybody we met on the </v>

2758
01:56:18.811 --> 01:56:22.980
<v Speaker 2>set of a pilot that never happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember that thing I have to say we met</v>

2759

<v Speaker 2>before then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2760
01:56:23.761 --> 01:56:24.594
<v Speaker 2>we met before then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we became friends on the side of </v>

2761
01:56:26.641 --> 01:56:27.240
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

<v Speaker 2>And I remember something he said to me,</v>

2769
01:56:38.791 --> 01:56:41.590
<v Speaker 2>Joe Rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

2770
01:56:42.920 --> 01:56:43.753
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you said you were talking about news </v>

2771
01:56:47.291 --> 01:56:48.800
<v Speaker 2>radio and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

2772
01:56:48.830 --> 01:56:49.663
<v Speaker 2>we were doing the pilot and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know there's a certain kind of like </v>

2773
01:56:53.610 --> 01:56:54.443
<v Speaker 2>special quality that happens amongst </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that creates a sitcom as much as </v>

2774
01:56:59.701 --> 01:57:02.700
<v Speaker 2>of the writing and I just hope we can </v>
<v Speaker 2>capture that.</v>

2775
01:57:03.360 --> 01:57:04.470
<v Speaker 2>Is that what I said?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah you weren't,</v>

2776
01:57:04.480 --> 01:57:06.840
<v Speaker 2>you were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you said that it was more than a Sitcom,</v>

2777
01:57:06.841 --> 01:57:10.140
<v Speaker 2>like a successful Sitcom is more than </v>
<v Speaker 2>just funny jokes.</v>

2778
01:57:10.730 --> 01:57:11.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it definitely is.</v>

2779
01:57:11.660 --> 01:57:13.190
<v Speaker 3>Do you agree with that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2780
01:57:13.191 --> 01:57:15.260
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you agree with your younger self?</v>

2781
01:57:15.290 --> 01:57:16.123
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>

2782
01:57:16.430 --> 01:57:17.263
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well I was super lucky in that I got </v>

2783
01:57:18.891 --> 01:57:19.724
<v Speaker 3>cast on news radio and we got along like</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cast got along on a pretty </v>

2784
01:57:24.081 --> 01:57:26.360
<v Speaker 3>incredible way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the way we jive together.</v>

2785
01:57:26.361 --> 01:57:27.660
<v Speaker 3>Like there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2786
01:57:28.310 --> 01:57:29.143
<v Speaker 3>there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean even like guys that I didn't </v>

2787
01:57:31.011 --> 01:57:33.650
<v Speaker 3>necessarily get along with that well </v>
<v Speaker 3>like Andy Dick,</v>

2788
01:57:33.710 --> 01:57:36.170
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who was just like so much work.</v>

2789
01:57:36.171 --> 01:57:37.004
<v Speaker 3>It was hard to get along with Andy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when we did get along like well </v>

2790
01:57:39.810 --> 01:57:41.630
<v Speaker 3>unset,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we had amazing chemistry.</v>

2791
01:57:41.660 --> 01:57:42.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2792
01:57:42.420 --> 01:57:43.400
<v Speaker 3>because our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our,</v>

2793
01:57:43.730 --> 01:57:45.320
<v Speaker 3>our characters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2794
01:57:45.321 --> 01:57:48.590
<v Speaker 3>the way we would interact with each </v>
<v Speaker 3>other like in scenes was great.</v>

2795
01:57:49.160 --> 01:57:50.510
<v Speaker 3>But then there was also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2796
01:57:50.690 --> 01:57:53.210
<v Speaker 3>everybody on it was so good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just,</v>

2797
01:57:53.240 --> 01:57:56.540
<v Speaker 3>that was just a super fortunate place to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be.</v>

2798
01:57:56.570 --> 01:57:58.720
<v Speaker 3>But there's been good actors and bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2799
01:57:58.730 --> 01:57:59.960
<v Speaker 3>and tickets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It don't work.</v>

2800
01:58:00.210 --> 01:58:03.050
<v Speaker 3>I had writing too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to have good writing.</v>

2801
01:58:03.080 --> 01:58:04.130
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Newsradio was like,</v>

2802
01:58:04.131 --> 01:58:04.964
<v Speaker 3>in a lot of ways it was a perfect storm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was also perfect storm in that it </v>

2803
01:58:07.281 --> 01:58:09.830
<v Speaker 3>wasn't successful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many years was zone five?</v>

2804
01:58:10.490 --> 01:58:12.950
<v Speaker 3>But it was never really successful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like at one point in time we were number</v>

2805
01:58:12.951 --> 01:58:13.784
<v Speaker 3>88 in the ratings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you think you were going to get </v>

2806
01:58:15.801 --> 01:58:16.580
<v Speaker 3>canceled?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2807
01:58:16.580 --> 01:58:17.690
<v Speaker 3>every year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every year.</v>

2808
01:58:17.720 --> 01:58:18.553
<v Speaker 3>The only year we didn't think we were </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to get cancer was the year we got </v>

2809
01:58:20.301 --> 01:58:21.134
<v Speaker 3>canceled.</v>

2810
01:58:22.530 --> 01:58:22.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2811
01:58:22.800 --> 01:58:23.633
<v Speaker 3>That was after Phil died a life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause we did and he came back and did a </v>

2812
01:58:26.641 --> 01:58:28.520
<v Speaker 3>a season with Jon Lovitz.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2813
01:58:28.521 --> 01:58:30.080
<v Speaker 3>That's the season I did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2814
01:58:30.170 --> 01:58:31.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we did.</v>

2815
01:58:31.041 --> 01:58:33.560
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that last season would love it.</v>

2816
01:58:33.710 --> 01:58:34.790
<v Speaker 3>And that was also</v>

2817
01:58:35.890 --> 01:58:40.390
<v Speaker 3>same time when we were doing overseas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was during the same creator,</v>

2818
01:58:40.391 --> 01:58:41.620
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Paul Simms.</v>

2819
01:58:41.621 --> 01:58:43.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2820
01:58:44.050 --> 01:58:47.320
<v Speaker 3>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just wasn't the same without Phil for</v>

2821
01:58:47.321 --> 01:58:48.154
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the,</v>

2822
01:58:48.160 --> 01:58:48.993
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the show wasn't owned by the right </v>

2823
01:58:50.801 --> 01:58:54.100
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it never got that juicy after friends</v>

2824
01:58:54.101 --> 01:58:58.380
<v Speaker 3>time slot that there was so many shows </v>
<v Speaker 3>that were horrible,</v>

2825
01:58:58.600 --> 01:59:01.150
<v Speaker 3>that went on for a long time and did </v>
<v Speaker 3>really well in the ratings.</v>

2826
01:59:01.151 --> 01:59:01.984
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you remember sex in the city or like </v>

2827
01:59:03.281 --> 01:59:07.720
<v Speaker 3>we used to call sex in the shitty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you ever see that it's not on NBC,</v>

2828

<v Speaker 3>not sex and the city,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Carolina in the shitty caroline in the </v>

2829
01:59:11.111 --> 01:59:12.010
<v Speaker 3>city,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the one.</v>

2830
01:59:13.600 --> 01:59:16.210
<v Speaker 3>They're the same thing to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a fucking chick show.</v>

2831
01:59:16.211 --> 01:59:18.610
<v Speaker 3>I have them in like a box in my brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a category.</v>

2832
01:59:18.940 --> 01:59:20.650
<v Speaker 3>And then there was another one that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>way worse.</v>

2833
01:59:20.650 --> 01:59:22.570
<v Speaker 3>The single guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember the single guy?</v>

2834
01:59:22.810 --> 01:59:24.340
<v Speaker 3>Actually I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2835
01:59:24.430 --> 01:59:29.200
<v Speaker 3>Jonathan Silverman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like someone had,</v>

2836
01:59:29.350 --> 01:59:33.130
<v Speaker 3>they got prime spots that you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>amazing spots.</v>

2837
01:59:33.131 --> 01:59:34.960
<v Speaker 3>There was like number two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>number three in the ratings,</v>

2838
01:59:35.440 --> 01:59:38.470
<v Speaker 3>there were the post friends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was friends Seinfeld,</v>

2839
01:59:38.650 --> 01:59:39.483
<v Speaker 3>there was that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that sort of a Thursday night right </v>

2840
01:59:42.100 --> 01:59:44.200
<v Speaker 3>group.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2841
01:59:44.260 --> 01:59:46.840
<v Speaker 3>that used to be what you needed to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>

2842
01:59:46.930 --> 01:59:47.763
<v Speaker 3>You need to get on that Thursday night </v>
<v Speaker 3>lineup in order to have a successful </v>

2843
01:59:50.740 --> 01:59:53.110
<v Speaker 3>must see tv.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2844
01:59:53.410 --> 01:59:56.020
<v Speaker 3>But there was a different time then </v>
<v Speaker 3>because when they moved you,</v>

2845
01:59:56.170 --> 01:59:59.080
<v Speaker 3>no one knew where the fuck you where we </v>
<v Speaker 3>got moved nine,</v>

2846
01:59:59.230 --> 02:00:01.990
<v Speaker 3>eight or nine times over the past five </v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

2847
02:00:02.050 --> 02:00:02.711
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's horrible.</v>

2848
02:00:02.711 --> 02:00:03.544
<v Speaker 3>So we were on like Monday night and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Sunday night and Tuesday night and we </v>

2849
02:00:05.801 --> 02:00:06.634
<v Speaker 3>were all over the fucking place and one </v>
<v Speaker 3>time we were on Thursday and we were </v>

2850
02:00:09.881 --> 02:00:10.714
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>number two.</v>

2851
02:00:11.040 --> 02:00:13.120
<v Speaker 3>Do you have a favorite episode that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>did?</v>

2852
02:00:13.150 --> 02:00:14.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the one we did in space,</v>

2853
02:00:14.980 --> 02:00:17.380
<v Speaker 3>we just space episode.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was ridiculous.</v>

2854
02:00:17.800 --> 02:00:18.633
<v Speaker 3>We did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2855
02:00:19.140 --> 02:00:22.150
<v Speaker 3>the fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the writers were so goddamn good.</v>

2856
02:00:22.740 --> 02:00:24.970
<v Speaker 3>It really spoiled me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2857
02:00:25.120 --> 02:00:25.953
<v Speaker 3>that's probably one of the reasons why I</v>
<v Speaker 3>never did a sitcom after that because </v>

2858
02:00:28.481 --> 02:00:30.860
<v Speaker 3>they were so good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you ever guest on a sec?</v>

2859
02:00:31.600 --> 02:00:33.760

2866
02:00:44.801 --> 02:00:48.700
<v Speaker 3>a couple of ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was the difference between being on</v>

2867
02:00:48.701 --> 02:00:52.510
<v Speaker 3>the show cast regular and guest starring</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're on a set and you're there all</v>

<v Speaker 3>the camera man are all the same folks </v>

2873
02:01:03.701 --> 02:01:04.780
<v Speaker 3>and you become friends with them.</v>

2874
02:01:05.900 --> 02:01:07.960
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a comfort comfort level there.</v>

<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just shoot me with all due respect </v>

2876
02:01:12.431 --> 02:01:14.440

<v Speaker 3>we were in space.</v>

2884
02:01:29.380 --> 02:01:31.690
<v Speaker 3>It was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dave Foley was like a,</v>

2885
02:01:31.720 --> 02:01:34.540
<v Speaker 3>almost like the secret producer of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>show because he,</v>

2886
02:01:34.541 --> 02:01:38.110
<v Speaker 3>they gave him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the writers were so smart that they gave</v>

2887
02:01:38.111 --> 02:01:40.010
<v Speaker 3>him a pretty much</v>

2888
02:01:40.010 --> 02:01:42.890
<v Speaker 1>everybody artistic license to try out </v>
<v Speaker 1>new ideas.</v>

2889
02:01:43.340 --> 02:01:44.173
<v Speaker 1>And because of the fact that Dave was </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the guys from kids in the hall </v>

2890
02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:48.830
<v Speaker 1>was such a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a brilliant writer.</v>

2891
02:01:48.831 --> 02:01:50.990
<v Speaker 1>Just a brilliant guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very fucking smart guy.</v>

2892
02:01:51.710 --> 02:01:52.790
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he always,</v>

2893
02:01:52.791 --> 02:01:53.990
<v Speaker 1>has he been on your illusion?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2894
02:01:54.020 --> 02:01:54.980
<v Speaker 1>He's been on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2895
02:01:55.400 --> 02:01:56.233
<v Speaker 1>He told some of the most depressing I </v>
<v Speaker 1>know about his doors in life about </v>

2896
02:01:58.641 --> 02:02:00.250
<v Speaker 1>divorce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good Lord.</v>

2897
02:02:00.450 --> 02:02:01.283
<v Speaker 1>To talk about a man who's been fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>need Paula over and over again through </v>

2898
02:02:06.321 --> 02:02:08.120
<v Speaker 1>divorce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is horrible,</v>

2899
02:02:08.121 --> 02:02:10.220
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Horrible what they did to him.</v>

2900
02:02:11.180 --> 02:02:12.410
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really sad,</v>

2901
02:02:13.070 --> 02:02:15.080
<v Speaker 1>but he sees finally I think coming </v>
<v Speaker 1>through it.</v>

2902
02:02:15.110 --> 02:02:15.451
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

2903
02:02:15.451 --> 02:02:17.960
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's on a sex successful,</v>

2904
02:02:18.080 --> 02:02:20.780
<v Speaker 1>successful show now that with doctor </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ken.</v>

2905
02:02:21.110 --> 02:02:21.943
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2906
02:02:22.070 --> 02:02:23.530
<v Speaker 1>What does that show called?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doc.</v>

2907
02:02:23.540 --> 02:02:24.980
<v Speaker 1>Doctor Ken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doctor.</v>

2908
02:02:25.070 --> 02:02:26.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's uh,</v>

2909
02:02:26.650 --> 02:02:27.500
<v Speaker 1>it's doing well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2910
02:02:27.501 --> 02:02:29.460
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that [inaudible] doing well?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>

2911
02:02:30.140 --> 02:02:33.600
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's holding on totally on their</v>

2912
02:02:33.610 --> 02:02:38.160
<v Speaker 1>own ticket cancelled and no renewed </v>
<v Speaker 1>renewed.</v>

2913
02:02:38.260 --> 02:02:39.093
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well good cause he owes about a half </v>

2914
02:02:40.370 --> 02:02:42.950
<v Speaker 1>million bucks or it can't get to Canada </v>
<v Speaker 1>if Dave doesn't go to Canada.</v>

2915
02:02:43.310 --> 02:02:45.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean if Dave doesn't pay up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

2916
02:02:45.200 --> 02:02:46.033
<v Speaker 1>his um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his alimony and child support are off </v>

2917
02:02:49.221 --> 02:02:50.054
<v Speaker 1>the charts because it was based on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>money that he was making during news </v>

2918
02:02:52.651 --> 02:02:53.450
<v Speaker 1>radio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2919
02:02:53.450 --> 02:02:54.283
<v Speaker 1>And then that was the most money I'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever made in his life and never came </v>

2920
02:02:56.001 --> 02:02:58.040
<v Speaker 1>close to it ever since.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it didn't matter.</v>

2921
02:02:58.160 --> 02:02:58.993
<v Speaker 1>The doctor said to him is one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most depressing things about the </v>

2922
02:03:00.471 --> 02:03:01.304
<v Speaker 1>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your ability to pay has no relation to </v>

2923
02:03:04.851 --> 02:03:09.050
<v Speaker 1>your obligation to pay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the doctor was like,</v>

2924
02:03:09.051 --> 02:03:09.884
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2925
02:03:09.890 --> 02:03:12.260
<v Speaker 1>you establish a lifestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your same doctor.</v>

2926
02:03:12.590 --> 02:03:14.270
<v Speaker 1>The doctor said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doc,</v>

2927
02:03:14.271 --> 02:03:17.030
<v Speaker 1>did he say doctor?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did the judge just having that.</v>

2928
02:03:17.410 --> 02:03:18.560
<v Speaker 1>It's a judge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some,</v>

2929
02:03:18.590 --> 02:03:20.870
<v Speaker 1>some soup character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some official,</v>

2930
02:03:20.900 --> 02:03:21.231
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2931
02:03:21.231 --> 02:03:22.630
<v Speaker 1>did you just have a brain aneurism?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2932
02:03:22.640 --> 02:03:25.910
<v Speaker 1>just forgot what I was talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You already and we need to take a break.</v>

2933
02:03:26.130 --> 02:03:26.963
<v Speaker 1>He trying to just sit down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to say for no reason </v>

2934
02:03:28.341 --> 02:03:30.410
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever other than to get your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>rocks off the,</v>

2935
02:03:30.660 --> 02:03:34.910
<v Speaker 1>the judge told him that and he was just </v>
<v Speaker 1>devastated.</v>

2936
02:03:34.940 --> 02:03:35.773
<v Speaker 1>And in a lot of ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he ever recovered from </v>

2937
02:03:37.551 --> 02:03:37.971
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2938
02:03:37.971 --> 02:03:38.804
<v Speaker 1>like when you find out that a doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean a judge is doing and the system </v>

2939
02:03:44.121 --> 02:03:48.940
<v Speaker 1>is so bad and so poorly constructed got </v>
<v Speaker 1>lives.</v>

2940
02:03:49.280 --> 02:03:50.113
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're already laughing.</v>

<v Speaker 1>brutal.</v>

2956
02:04:26.440 --> 02:04:29.060
<v Speaker 1>Can Canada's very different than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>United States.</v>

2957
02:04:29.660 --> 02:04:30.550
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'll ask you about something.</v>

2960
02:04:37.080 --> 02:04:38.100
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just hit me.</v>

2961
02:04:38.950 --> 02:04:40.560
<v Speaker 3>Do you want to keep talking about Foley </v>
<v Speaker 3>weekend?</v>

2962
02:04:40.620 --> 02:04:42.060
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2963
02:04:42.330 --> 02:04:43.163
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's this girl I was trying to date </v>

2964
02:04:44.971 --> 02:04:45.804
<v Speaker 3>or should nine interest in May but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but has gone to the Amazon and done </v>

2965
02:04:51.451 --> 02:04:54.780
<v Speaker 3>Iowasca.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And who she said that you,</v>

2966
02:04:55.500 --> 02:05:00.500
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if she learned about it </v>
<v Speaker 3>from you or you were advocating for it,</v>

2967
02:05:01.440 --> 02:05:03.210
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>

2968
02:05:03.211 --> 02:05:04.044
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she went down there a couple times and </v>

2969
02:05:04.651 --> 02:05:07.800
<v Speaker 3>then did it not in the Amazon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many times have you done it?</v>

2970
02:05:08.610 --> 02:05:11.580
<v Speaker 3>I haven't done Iowasca.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I've done is Dmt,</v>

2971
02:05:11.581 --> 02:05:13.660
<v Speaker 3>which is the active compound in Iowa </v>
<v Speaker 3>still.</v>

2972
02:05:13.670 --> 02:05:14.503
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2973
02:05:14.550 --> 02:05:15.990
<v Speaker 3>What I ask it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's,</v>

2974
02:05:16.020 --> 02:05:16.853
<v Speaker 3>here's what I want us to is the Amazon </v>
<v Speaker 3>indigenous people figured out a way to </v>

2975
02:05:21.061 --> 02:05:21.894
<v Speaker 3>make dmt orally active DMT is broken </v>
<v Speaker 3>down in your gut by something called </v>

2976
02:05:26.791 --> 02:05:29.640
<v Speaker 3>monoamine oxidase and all of this makes </v>
<v Speaker 3>sense.</v>

2977
02:05:29.700 --> 02:05:33.420
<v Speaker 3>So when you eat it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why when you eat a lot of grasses</v>

2978
02:05:33.421 --> 02:05:34.254
<v Speaker 3>and different plants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't get high off the DMT in it </v>

2979
02:05:35.851 --> 02:05:37.350
<v Speaker 3>because it gets broken down in your gut.</v>

2980
02:05:37.950 --> 02:05:38.783
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what they figured out as a way to </v>

2981
02:05:39.631 --> 02:05:40.464
<v Speaker 3>combine the leaves of one plant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which contained the DMT and the source </v>

2982
02:05:45.381 --> 02:05:47.500
<v Speaker 3>of the leaves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>email and Hibbert.</v>

2983
02:05:47.640 --> 02:05:49.110
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an Mao inhibitor.</v>

2984
02:05:50.070 --> 02:05:53.460
<v Speaker 3>And so this combination of the two </v>
<v Speaker 3>plants,</v>

2985
02:05:53.580 --> 02:05:57.510
<v Speaker 3>one that contains DMT and one that </v>
<v Speaker 3>suppresses model aiming oxidase and your</v>

2986
02:05:57.511 --> 02:06:01.800
<v Speaker 3>gut allows you to experience dimethyl </v>
<v Speaker 3>trip to me orally.</v>

2987
02:06:02.100 --> 02:06:06.030
<v Speaker 3>So it's a long dmt trip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I've done is smoke it,</v>

2988
02:06:06.031 --> 02:06:08.580
<v Speaker 3>which is way more intense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but way shorter.</v>

2989
02:06:08.581 --> 02:06:09.414
<v Speaker 3>Last,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have you?</v>

2990
02:06:09.420 --> 02:06:11.790
<v Speaker 3>When was the last time he did something?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause I think a year ago.</v>

2991
02:06:11.970 --> 02:06:12.900
<v Speaker 3>A year ago?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2992
02:06:12.960 --> 02:06:14.910
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

2993
02:06:14.940 --> 02:06:16.070
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I,</v>

2994
02:06:16.090 --> 02:06:18.630
<v Speaker 3>you know me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've known each other 20 some years.</v>

2995
02:06:18.870 --> 02:06:22.560
<v Speaker 3>I'm not like a pot smoker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't really drink at all.</v>

2996
02:06:23.110 --> 02:06:26.430
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm a drug experimenter.</v>

2997
02:06:26.820 --> 02:06:29.790
<v Speaker 3>Like I've done mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gas,</v>

2998
02:06:29.820 --> 02:06:31.380
<v Speaker 3>that's my favorite truck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a great drug.</v>

2999
02:06:31.700 --> 02:06:33.390
<v Speaker 3>It's very similar.</v>

3000
02:06:33.420 --> 02:06:35.570
<v Speaker 3>They are in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in their reaction,</v>

3001
02:06:35.590 --> 02:06:40.440
<v Speaker 3>especially at high doses to dmt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in fact they're there.</v>

3002
02:06:40.470 --> 02:06:42.450
<v Speaker 3>They're very similar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3003
02:06:42.510 --> 02:06:45.360
<v Speaker 3>as far as the compound themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's,</v>

3004
02:06:45.361 --> 02:06:47.490
<v Speaker 3>where the way it's expressed in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>body.</v>

3005
02:06:47.950 --> 02:06:52.950
<v Speaker 3>A DMT is n n dimethyltryptamine and when</v>
<v Speaker 3>Psilocybin is broken down in the body,</v>

3006
02:06:54.241 --> 02:06:56.280
<v Speaker 3>it produces something called for Fox </v>
<v Speaker 3>four.</v>

3007
02:06:56.430 --> 02:07:00.240
<v Speaker 3>See and Hen Diane [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm kind of like glazing manner,</v>

3008
02:07:00.300 --> 02:07:01.133
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying they're really closely </v>

3009
02:07:02.461 --> 02:07:03.294
<v Speaker 3>related with the most potent psychedelic</v>
<v Speaker 3>drugs are very closely related to basic </v>

3010
02:07:07.531 --> 02:07:12.520
<v Speaker 3>human neurochemistry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And DMT is human neurochemistry is,</v>

3011
02:07:12.540 --> 02:07:15.330
<v Speaker 3>is actually the most potent psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 3>drug known to man.</v>

3012
02:07:15.360 --> 02:07:18.720
<v Speaker 3>And it's actually produced by your body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's produced in your liver,</v>

3013
02:07:18.721 --> 02:07:21.660
<v Speaker 3>it's produced in your lungs and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>produced pineal gland.</v>

3014
02:07:21.870 --> 02:07:22.800
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me ask you a question.</v>

3015
02:07:23.100 --> 02:07:25.380
<v Speaker 3>When you smoke the DMT,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many times have you done it?</v>

3016
02:07:25.980 --> 02:07:26.813
<v Speaker 3>Nine Times.</v>

3017
02:07:27.090 --> 02:07:27.840
<v Speaker 3>Nine?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3018
02:07:27.840 --> 02:07:29.310
<v Speaker 3>Will there be a 10?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3019
02:07:29.730 --> 02:07:32.100
<v Speaker 3>Today with Wayne,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3020
02:07:32.101 --> 02:07:34.740
<v Speaker 3>well I don't have it here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if I did,</v>

3021
02:07:34.770 --> 02:07:36.580
<v Speaker 3>if really wanted to go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we could do it.</v>

3022
02:07:36.640 --> 02:07:39.760
<v Speaker 3>What would live with them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ready to do it again.</v>

3023
02:07:39.761 --> 02:07:42.850
<v Speaker 3>I need,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I usually need some time after I</v>

3024
02:07:42.851 --> 02:07:46.660
<v Speaker 3>do it to sit back and think about it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>absorb it and taken in.</v>

3025
02:07:47.370 --> 02:07:49.180
<v Speaker 3>But do you feel like it helped your </v>
<v Speaker 3>standup at all?</v>

3026
02:07:49.240 --> 02:07:51.370
<v Speaker 3>100%.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It helps everything in my life.</v>

3027
02:07:51.430 --> 02:07:54.430
<v Speaker 3>It helps me or any downside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3028
02:07:54.730 --> 02:07:56.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get the,</v>

3029
02:07:56.680 --> 02:08:01.600
<v Speaker 3>there's a real anxiety that happened to </v>
<v Speaker 3>me once after it was over.</v>

3030
02:08:01.990 --> 02:08:05.470
<v Speaker 3>I did one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one trip where it was incredibly intense</v>

3031
02:08:05.560 --> 02:08:08.770
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't say overdose.</v>

3032
02:08:08.771 --> 02:08:12.010
<v Speaker 3>You don't overdose because it's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>natural part of your brain.</v>

3033
02:08:12.011 --> 02:08:15.280
<v Speaker 3>Your brain knows how to bring it back to</v>
<v Speaker 3>baseline very quickly.</v>

3034
02:08:15.281 --> 02:08:17.830
<v Speaker 3>It's like one of the most transient </v>
<v Speaker 3>drugs ever observed in the body.</v>

3035
02:08:17.830 --> 02:08:18.663
<v Speaker 3>You go from being blasted out of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking mind to completely sober in 20 </v>

3036
02:08:23.231 --> 02:08:25.690
<v Speaker 3>minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

3037
02:08:25.780 --> 02:08:26.613
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How would you then you just dive back </v>

3038
02:08:28.991 --> 02:08:30.670
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The last time I did it,</v>

3039
02:08:30.700 --> 02:08:32.740
<v Speaker 3>we did it like four or five times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it was,</v>

3040
02:08:33.160 --> 02:08:37.360
<v Speaker 3>I was pretty Gonzo for about an hour and</v>
<v Speaker 3>a half or so.</v>

3041
02:08:37.390 --> 02:08:41.170
<v Speaker 3>Somewhere around there just go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We would go in,</v>

3042
02:08:41.380 --> 02:08:42.970
<v Speaker 3>come out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go back in again.</v>

3043
02:08:43.340 --> 02:08:45.700
<v Speaker 3>Meantime,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole time this is going on,</v>

3044
02:08:45.701 --> 02:08:47.950
<v Speaker 3>we're playing this a South American </v>
<v Speaker 3>music,</v>

3045
02:08:47.951 --> 02:08:51.790
<v Speaker 3>these ICAROS,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which these shamans have created to sort</v>

3046
02:08:51.791 --> 02:08:54.380
<v Speaker 3>of coax the experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need a showman.</v>

3047
02:08:55.040 --> 02:08:55.960
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't need a showman.</v>

3048
02:08:56.290 --> 02:08:57.940
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to do DMT,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

3049
02:08:58.270 --> 02:09:00.580

<v Speaker 3>I'm kind of a straight,</v>

3051
02:09:01.931 --> 02:09:02.764
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>

3052
02:09:03.130 --> 02:09:05.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm not an edgy guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

3053
02:09:05.300 --> 02:09:06.520
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3054
02:09:06.820 --> 02:09:08.830
<v Speaker 3>what would you recommend?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How would you recommend they do?</v>

3055
02:09:08.890 --> 02:09:09.880
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever smoked crack?</v>

3056
02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.280
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would you know with Wayne?</v>

3057
02:09:12.430 --> 02:09:14.110
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if I did this face,</v>

3058
02:09:14.430 --> 02:09:15.780
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know.</v>

3059
02:09:15.960 --> 02:09:17.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm no interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in crack.</v>

3060
02:09:17.680 --> 02:09:19.450
<v Speaker 3>I don't have any interest in even </v>
<v Speaker 3>cocaine.</v>

3061
02:09:19.500 --> 02:09:21.040
<v Speaker 3>I've never done cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

3062
02:09:21.220 --> 02:09:22.300
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

3063
02:09:22.301 --> 02:09:23.134
<v Speaker 3>I don't have any interest in stimulants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not interested in anything that </v>

3064
02:09:26.021 --> 02:09:29.050
<v Speaker 3>gives me confidence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not interested in any false sense of</v>

3065
02:09:29.051 --> 02:09:31.990
<v Speaker 3>bravado and getting boosted up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not interested in that.</v>

3066
02:09:31.991 --> 02:09:32.670
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3067
02:09:32.670 --> 02:09:36.760
<v Speaker 3>If it feels like amphetamines and speed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they do is they,</v>

3068
02:09:36.900 --> 02:09:40.750
<v Speaker 3>they remove inhibitions in a way that </v>
<v Speaker 3>gets you in a lot of trouble.</v>

3069
02:09:40.860 --> 02:09:41.620
<v Speaker 3>What about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3070
02:09:41.620 --> 02:09:42.820
<v Speaker 3>drinking?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like drinking,</v>

3071
02:09:43.180 --> 02:09:47.230
<v Speaker 3>even though that's a barbiturate right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bar barbiturate it drinking is a downer,</v>

3072
02:09:47.380 --> 02:09:49.600
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not a barbiturate though.</v>

3073
02:09:49.810 --> 02:09:53.110
<v Speaker 3>Like isn't a barbiturate a specific </v>
<v Speaker 3>class of drugs is alcohol.</v>

3074
02:09:53.111 --> 02:09:55.100
<v Speaker 3>Barbiturates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think Erbitux,</v>

3075
02:09:55.110 --> 02:09:58.600
<v Speaker 3>it is a very specific class of Downer </v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

3076
02:09:58.900 --> 02:10:00.820
<v Speaker 3>We're gonna find out that was when I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>

3077
02:10:01.180 --> 02:10:03.370
<v Speaker 3>I not asked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't drink really.</v>

3078
02:10:03.371 --> 02:10:06.650
<v Speaker 3>But as there's a rule,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say barbiturates overdose,</v>

3079
02:10:06.760 --> 02:10:10.120
<v Speaker 3>Bababababa central nervous system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>depressants,</v>

3080
02:10:10.180 --> 02:10:11.380
<v Speaker 3>alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 3>opiates.</v>

3081
02:10:11.530 --> 02:10:12.363
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's what they're saying is an </v>

3082
02:10:13.151 --> 02:10:14.560
<v Speaker 3>overdose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3083
02:10:14.561 --> 02:10:16.860
<v Speaker 3>I'm not talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm just saying that Picchu,</v>

3084
02:10:16.960 --> 02:10:20.350
<v Speaker 3>it's in overdose with other central </v>
<v Speaker 3>nervous system depression.</v>

3085
02:10:20.351 --> 02:10:20.770
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3086
02:10:20.770 --> 02:10:23.320
<v Speaker 3>that's not what it's saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's not saying,</v>

3087
02:10:23.430 --> 02:10:25.510
<v Speaker 3>so it's different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're saying something different.</v>

3088
02:10:25.511 --> 02:10:26.344
<v Speaker 3>You're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying is alcohol or </v>

3089
02:10:27.251 --> 02:10:30.040
<v Speaker 3>barbiturates?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's no,</v>

3090
02:10:30.430 --> 02:10:31.263
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It said you shouldn't be mixed with </v>

3091
02:10:31.871 --> 02:10:32.704
<v Speaker 3>alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Barbiturates should not be mixed with </v>

3092
02:10:33.891 --> 02:10:34.280
<v Speaker 3>alcohol.</v>

3093
02:10:34.280 --> 02:10:39.080
<v Speaker 1>So edition is alcohol a drug or </v>
<v Speaker 1>antidepressant or barbiturate or all the</v>

3094
02:10:39.081 --> 02:10:40.780
<v Speaker 1>above?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck kind of question is that?</v>

3095
02:10:41.580 --> 02:10:44.150
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3096
02:10:44.151 --> 02:10:45.860
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a depressant.</v>

3097
02:10:45.980 --> 02:10:48.200
<v Speaker 1>It's a depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a stimulant.</v>

3098
02:10:48.230 --> 02:10:49.190
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a stimulant.</v>

3099
02:10:49.220 --> 02:10:51.890
<v Speaker 1>But it does loosen inhibitions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3100
02:10:52.010 --> 02:10:53.360
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social lubricant.</v>

02:10:53.380 --> 02:10:55.520
<v Speaker 1>Me With the layman when I'm drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3103
02:10:56.821 --> 02:10:57.950
<v Speaker 1>but way more,</v>

<v Speaker 1>but I will fail.</v>

3107
02:11:08.211 --> 02:11:11.690
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I'm a little more sexually </v>
<v Speaker 1>aggressive when I'm on a whoa.</v>

3108
02:11:12.170 --> 02:11:13.003

<v Speaker 1>We can use that descriptor,</v>

3110
02:11:19.280 --> 02:11:20.720
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't know enough.</v>

3136
02:12:05.570 --> 02:12:06.740
<v Speaker 1>I liked the way it smells though.</v>

3137
02:12:06.740 --> 02:12:09.530
<v Speaker 1>I liked the way it tastes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to sip it with dinner.</v>

3138
02:12:09.590 --> 02:12:12.590
<v Speaker 1>I like a nice wine with dinner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I like a little buzz too.</v>

3139
02:12:12.760 --> 02:12:15.680
<v Speaker 1>I'll go like a couple of glasses of nice</v>

<v Speaker 1>I again,</v>

3141
02:12:17.300 --> 02:12:19.970
<v Speaker 1>it's far from judging as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just curious.</v>

3142
02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:20.440
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3144
02:12:22.600 --> 02:12:24.230
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

3145
02:12:24.760 --> 02:12:28.130
<v Speaker 1>so alcohol is a depressant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I just meant.</v>

3146
02:12:28.200 --> 02:12:31.040
<v Speaker 1>It's like a barbiturate it said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a steaming up,</v>

3147
02:12:31.160 --> 02:12:36.160
<v Speaker 1>but it does allow me to get what your </v>
<v Speaker 1>word confident race,</v>

3148
02:12:36.860 --> 02:12:37.610
<v Speaker 1>say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3149
02:12:37.610 --> 02:12:38.443
<v Speaker 1>you might meet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>might have confidence issues a little </v>

3150
02:12:39.981 --> 02:12:40.814
<v Speaker 1>bit and I'm chillers really comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comedian asking for approval from </v>

3151
02:12:46.521 --> 02:12:48.410
<v Speaker 1>strangers might have competence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I'm saying,</v>

3152
02:12:48.470 --> 02:12:50.290
<v Speaker 1>that's an interesting insight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me think about that.</v>

3153
02:12:50.300 --> 02:12:53.540
<v Speaker 1>I go on deepen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I take one chances go on a whim.</v>

3154
02:12:54.110 --> 02:12:56.120
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's probably why you like it,</v>

3155
02:12:56.121 --> 02:12:58.010
<v Speaker 1>because it alleviates some of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety.</v>

3156
02:12:58.790 --> 02:12:59.623
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's things that happen in </v>

3157
02:13:00.621 --> 02:13:03.020
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic drugs that make you more </v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable.</v>

3158
02:13:03.260 --> 02:13:04.071
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3164
02:13:14.210 --> 02:13:16.850
<v Speaker 1>the after effects were way too brutal </v>
<v Speaker 1>for me.</v>

3165
02:13:17.540 --> 02:13:20.960
<v Speaker 1>The Post Post trip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the trip was wonderful.</v>

3166
02:13:21.200 --> 02:13:22.033
<v Speaker 1>Trip was amazing and I got some pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>deep insight about the nature of </v>

3167
02:13:25.551 --> 02:13:28.340
<v Speaker 1>insecurities and how they manifest </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself in social security.</v>

3168
02:13:28.350 --> 02:13:29.890
<v Speaker 1>May need the conversations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3169
02:13:30.290 --> 02:13:32.640
<v Speaker 1>But the next day,</v>

3170
02:13:33.240 --> 02:13:35.070
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't read.</v>

3171
02:13:35.370 --> 02:13:36.203
<v Speaker 3>I remember I was at a coffee shop and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was trying to read a magazine and I was </v>

3172
02:13:38.971 --> 02:13:40.430
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't even fucking read.</v>

3173

<v Speaker 3>Couldn't kind of constant trail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3174
02:13:42.900 --> 02:13:46.200
<v Speaker 3>And then I found out about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's before I had found out about htp,</v>

3175
02:13:46.500 --> 02:13:48.000
<v Speaker 3>five htp,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five htp,</v>

3176
02:13:48.001 --> 02:13:48.834
<v Speaker 3>which converts to Serotonin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that serotonin </v>

3177
02:13:50.641 --> 02:13:51.870
<v Speaker 3>depletion because of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3178

<v Speaker 3>when you do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3179
02:13:53.490 --> 02:13:56.010
<v Speaker 3>Mtma,</v>

3180
02:13:56.011 --> 02:13:58.640
<v Speaker 3>blast of Serotonin and you feel amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3181
02:13:58.780 --> 02:13:59.191
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3182
02:13:59.191 --> 02:14:02.000
<v Speaker 3>after it's over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that shit crashes and your,</v>

3183
02:14:02.060 --> 02:14:04.530
<v Speaker 3>your body body's depleted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You feel like a dry sponge.</v>

3184
02:14:04.531 --> 02:14:06.210
<v Speaker 3>Like you don't feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To me,</v>

3185
02:14:06.211 --> 02:14:08.310
<v Speaker 3>at least I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dry sponge that can't read.</v>

3187
02:14:09.030 --> 02:14:13.650
<v Speaker 3>my brain wasn't firing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just wasn't working well and I didn't</v>

3188
02:14:13.680 --> 02:14:14.513
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it didn't like the feeling and it took </v>

3189
02:14:16.230 --> 02:14:20.160
<v Speaker 3>at least a day or so from fruit to </v>
<v Speaker 3>rebound and I was like,</v>

3190
02:14:20.190 --> 02:14:21.023
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're probably not going to do that </v>

3191
02:14:21.721 --> 02:14:22.050
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>

3192

<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3193
02:14:23.100 --> 02:14:24.630
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not Worth it.</v>

3194
02:14:25.650 --> 02:14:27.900
<v Speaker 3>The next day is just not worth it to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3195
02:14:27.901 --> 02:14:30.150
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

<v Speaker 3>but the people that have heard that from</v>

3200
02:14:40.350 --> 02:14:41.183
<v Speaker 3>the people that have talked to their </v>
<v Speaker 3>healthy saying there's always a price </v>

<v Speaker 3>mushrooms.</v>

3203
02:14:49.200 --> 02:14:50.033
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never felt a physical price for </v>

3204
02:14:50.831 --> 02:14:53.310
<v Speaker 3>mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's zero physical price you pay from</v>

3207
02:14:57.061 --> 02:15:00.930
<v Speaker 3>because you purge and you'll do a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>throwing up and a lot of diarrhea.</v>

3208
02:15:00.990 --> 02:15:02.670
<v Speaker 3>That's why I'm not doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

3209
02:15:03.120 --> 02:15:05.250
<v Speaker 3>Well that's one of the reason I will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean again,</v>

3210
02:15:05.251 --> 02:15:06.570
<v Speaker 3>I'm a drug experimenter.</v>

3211
02:15:06.570 --> 02:15:09.300
<v Speaker 3>I know everyone says that it's like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>euphemism for,</v>

3212
02:15:09.301 --> 02:15:10.134
<v Speaker 3>I'm a drug user,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm actually just like on the right </v>

3213
02:15:11.851 --> 02:15:12.684
<v Speaker 3>circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I deal with drug even though it's not </v>

3214
02:15:15.031 --> 02:15:20.031
<v Speaker 3>part of my life in any way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I don't like throwing up.</v>

3215
02:15:20.130 --> 02:15:20.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

3216
02:15:20.770 --> 02:15:21.603

<v Speaker 3>He understands psychological now the </v>

3217
02:15:23.591 --> 02:15:24.424
<v Speaker 3>stuff is disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody that tells me they've tried </v>

3218
02:15:26.461 --> 02:15:29.970
<v Speaker 3>Iowasca says it's fucking disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to go to the jungle.</v>

3219
02:15:30.270 --> 02:15:31.830
<v Speaker 3>And I mean I'm sure I could do it around</v>
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>

3220
02:15:31.831 --> 02:15:35.040
<v Speaker 3>but not in the bugs and snakes and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jaguars and all that shit.</v>

3221
02:15:35.070 --> 02:15:37.530
<v Speaker 3>You can go fuck yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to fucking rain forest.</v>

3222
02:15:37.980 --> 02:15:38.813
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But people have had these amazing </v>

3223
02:15:40.051 --> 02:15:43.170
<v Speaker 3>experiences cause they do it in the rain</v>
<v Speaker 3>forest and that's where it's from.</v>

3224
02:15:43.171 --> 02:15:44.560
<v Speaker 3>And See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm also,</v>

3225
02:15:44.640 --> 02:15:48.330
<v Speaker 3>I hate to say this and this is going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>sound prejudiced,</v>

3226

<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3228
02:15:59.100 --> 02:16:03.210
<v Speaker 3>there's a good reason to be because </v>
<v Speaker 3>schamens are a lot like Yogis,</v>

3229
02:16:03.570 --> 02:16:04.403
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of yogis that are really </v>

3230
02:16:06.301 --> 02:16:09.720
<v Speaker 3>just douche bags that are trying to fuck</v>
<v Speaker 3>women that are in their classes.</v>

3231
02:16:09.750 --> 02:16:10.583
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's a lot of sham and that are </v>

3232
02:16:11.731 --> 02:16:12.564
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I feel like I have a pretty good </v>

3233
02:16:14.371 --> 02:16:15.690
<v Speaker 3>radar about people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3234
02:16:16.350 --> 02:16:17.183
<v Speaker 3>that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank type of people that want to be a </v>

3235
02:16:18.571 --> 02:16:19.404
<v Speaker 3>showman boy who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who knows what you're going to get </v>

3236
02:16:21.601 --> 02:16:23.150
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Jen,</v>

3237
02:16:23.300 --> 02:16:26.120
<v Speaker 3>he was a friend of mine that was a sham </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they used to do these rituals on his</v>

3238
02:16:26.150 --> 02:16:27.660
<v Speaker 3>resume.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Writers on his resume.</v>

3239
02:16:27.690 --> 02:16:28.523
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was a,</v>

3240
02:16:28.530 --> 02:16:30.970
<v Speaker 3>he would guide them and these people </v>
<v Speaker 3>through,</v>

3241
02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:31.833
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these I wasco rituals and he wanted to </v>

3242
02:16:33.671 --> 02:16:35.320
<v Speaker 3>do it with me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He died.</v>

3243
02:16:35.650 --> 02:16:37.930
<v Speaker 3>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would definitely do IOWASCA.</v>

3244
02:16:37.931 --> 02:16:41.350
<v Speaker 3>And what Iowasca is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is just a less intense,</v>

3245
02:16:41.590 --> 02:16:45.880
<v Speaker 3>longer lasting version of a DMT trip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the DM tree trip,</v>

3246
02:16:45.910 --> 02:16:48.250
<v Speaker 3>the Dow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm more interested in DMT.</v>

3247
02:16:48.430 --> 02:16:51.720
<v Speaker 3>DMT is Iowasca Iowasca so you don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>throw up the act.</v>

3248
02:16:51.730 --> 02:16:52.600
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't throw up.</v>

3249
02:16:53.120 --> 02:16:53.953
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're smoking it and it goes directly </v>

3250
02:16:55.601 --> 02:16:58.180
<v Speaker 3>to your bloodstream because what happens</v>
<v Speaker 3>instantaneously?</v>

3251
02:16:58.300 --> 02:16:59.770
<v Speaker 3>How many does he take?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Omni pump?</v>

3252
02:16:59.830 --> 02:17:02.020
<v Speaker 3>Three big hits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a hit,</v>

3253
02:17:02.080 --> 02:17:05.390
<v Speaker 3>not even a puff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Three is like number,</v>

3254
02:17:05.470 --> 02:17:07.420
<v Speaker 3>you'll hold it in now you take big hits.</v>

3255
02:17:10.690 --> 02:17:11.523
<v Speaker 8>Okay,</v>

3256
02:17:12.840 --> 02:17:16.850
<v Speaker 3>hit it again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then at the second one,</v>

3257
02:17:16.851 --> 02:17:17.684
<v Speaker 3>reality starts getting real fragile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You start seeing things pixelate around </v>

3258
02:17:21.321 --> 02:17:23.090
<v Speaker 3>you and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you gotta go one more time.</v>

3259
02:17:23.091 --> 02:17:24.140
<v Speaker 3>One more time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one more time.</v>

3260
02:17:28.070 --> 02:17:30.100
<v Speaker 3>You put the pipe down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lay down.</v>

3261
02:17:31.250 --> 02:17:35.450
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

3262
02:17:35.510 --> 02:17:36.343
<v Speaker 3>And then it just overcomes you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You go through the flower of life and </v>

3263
02:17:39.681 --> 02:17:40.514
<v Speaker 3>enter into this massive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>infinite geometric pattern that's made </v>

3264
02:17:45.171 --> 02:17:47.960
<v Speaker 3>out of love and understanding and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>communicate with God.</v>

3265
02:17:49.220 --> 02:17:50.720
<v Speaker 3>And that's your definition of a good </v>
<v Speaker 3>trip.</v>

3266
02:17:50.930 --> 02:17:54.350
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty intense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can be terrifying to some people.</v>

3267
02:17:54.351 --> 02:17:55.184
<v Speaker 3>It definitely is terrifying if you try </v>
<v Speaker 3>to control it and manipulate it because </v>

3268
02:17:58.761 --> 02:18:02.330
<v Speaker 3>then you're going to be in a wrestling </v>
<v Speaker 3>match with your emotions and your mind.</v>

3269
02:18:02.331 --> 02:18:03.164
<v Speaker 3>You have to be able to let go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the most difficult things </v>

3270
02:18:04.971 --> 02:18:05.804
<v Speaker 3>with any really intense at breaks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you're saying psychedelic </v>

3271
02:18:08.451 --> 02:18:10.340
<v Speaker 3>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you gotta be willing to let go.</v>

3272
02:18:10.370 --> 02:18:12.870
<v Speaker 3>How would you compare it to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I've only done mushrooms.</v>

3273
02:18:12.890 --> 02:18:13.490
<v Speaker 3>How many?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3274
02:18:13.490 --> 02:18:15.260
<v Speaker 3>you say you've done mushrooms when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>saved,</v>

3275
02:18:15.261 --> 02:18:15.861
<v Speaker 3>done mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3276
02:18:15.861 --> 02:18:18.570
<v Speaker 3>what kind of dose are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3277
02:18:18.571 --> 02:18:20.270
<v Speaker 3>aid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hate the taste of it,</v>

3278
02:18:20.271 --> 02:18:22.010
<v Speaker 3>so I put it in a big Mac and I get him.</v>

3279
02:18:23.390 --> 02:18:24.223
<v Speaker 3>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That might be the worst way to take </v>

3280
02:18:28.430 --> 02:18:29.800
<v Speaker 3>mushrooms I've ever heard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

3281
02:18:29.801 --> 02:18:32.270
<v Speaker 3>I kind of big Mac,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of like fucking big Mac.</v>

3282
02:18:32.360 --> 02:18:33.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever had one of those?</v>

3283
02:18:33.590 --> 02:18:34.730
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mcdonald's?</v>

3284
02:18:35.270 --> 02:18:36.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but why would you do that?</v>

3285
02:18:36.411 --> 02:18:38.510
<v Speaker 3>Why would you delete mushrooms in a big </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mac?</v>

3286
02:18:38.540 --> 02:18:42.170
<v Speaker 3>Because I love big MACs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you judging?</v>

3287
02:18:42.171 --> 02:18:44.060
<v Speaker 3>Big macs now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so bad for you.</v>

3288
02:18:44.061 --> 02:18:46.100
<v Speaker 3>It's factory farmed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This bucket.</v>

3289
02:18:46.101 --> 02:18:49.880
<v Speaker 3>Tortured cow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Taking them in with the mother Gaia.</v>

3290
02:18:50.870 --> 02:18:51.703
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it was just that was my </v>

3291
02:18:52.491 --> 02:18:53.324
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What if I said times I said dug in and </v>

3292
02:18:55.881 --> 02:18:57.210
<v Speaker 3>out Burger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd deputy better.</v>

3293
02:18:57.680 --> 02:18:59.540
<v Speaker 3>Not really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We still,</v>

3294
02:18:59.570 --> 02:19:01.460
<v Speaker 3>they're much more delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What about from the counter?</v>

3295
02:19:01.470 --> 02:19:03.350
<v Speaker 3>What if I got our cheeseburger from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>counter,</v>

3296
02:19:03.790 --> 02:19:05.840
<v Speaker 3>the bride at home?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because what I did,</v>

3297
02:19:05.841 --> 02:19:06.674
<v Speaker 3>I kind of spinning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even supposed to eat meat for days </v>

3298
02:19:08.211 --> 02:19:10.640
<v Speaker 3>before you do mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not true.</v>

3299
02:19:10.700 --> 02:19:11.720
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3300
02:19:12.220 --> 02:19:13.053
<v Speaker 3>The rule is that people that get the </v>
<v Speaker 3>most out of the experience recommend </v>

3301
02:19:18.080 --> 02:19:18.913
<v Speaker 3>that you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a vegetable only diet for at </v>

3302
02:19:22.521 --> 02:19:26.220
<v Speaker 3>least 24 hours before you do any </v>
<v Speaker 3>question.</v>

3303
02:19:26.660 --> 02:19:28.490
<v Speaker 3>Let's say meeting just salads</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's my favorite dressing sugar in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I avoid sugar.</v>

3306
02:19:34.370 --> 02:19:36.950
<v Speaker 1>I would say avoid sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So just like a vinegarette,</v>

3307
02:19:36.951 --> 02:19:39.170
<v Speaker 1>avoid toxins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Avoid Nasty Shit.</v>

3308
02:19:39.200 --> 02:19:41.390

<v Speaker 1>but I want to know what kind of dose </v>

3313

<v Speaker 1>you're you're taking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that you kind of mushrooms </v>

<v Speaker 1>I would say fit like in here.</v>

3316
02:20:00.590 --> 02:20:01.700
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

3318
02:20:02.110 --> 02:20:06.950
<v Speaker 1>you have a baby doses so you're not even</v>
<v Speaker 1>experiencing the dissolving of reality.</v>

3319
02:20:07.550 --> 02:20:09.620
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just trying to have a good time.</v>

3320
02:20:11.180 --> 02:20:12.013
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real that was my goal is they have </v>

3321
02:20:14.650 --> 02:20:15.680
<v Speaker 1>mushroom chips.</v>

3322
02:20:15.980 --> 02:20:19.490
<v Speaker 1>The real mushroom trips only get a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>drinks.</v>

3323
02:20:19.520 --> 02:20:22.280
<v Speaker 1>They get again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean dissolve the solving of</v>

3324
02:20:22.281 --> 02:20:25.070
<v Speaker 1>reality?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the goal of being on mushrooms.</v>

3325
02:20:25.190 --> 02:20:26.001
<v Speaker 1>Not like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3326
02:20:26.001 --> 02:20:29.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to see aerosmith at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood bowl and you could do that.</v>

3327
02:20:29.240 --> 02:20:31.220
<v Speaker 1>That's the way I do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing wrong with that.</v>

3328
02:20:31.221 --> 02:20:32.300
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so tell what I'm saying.</v>

3329
02:20:32.301 --> 02:20:35.030
<v Speaker 1>If you want something that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>commensurate with a dmt experience,</v>

3330
02:20:35.031 --> 02:20:35.864
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have to take five grams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have to take a large </v>

3331
02:20:38.240 --> 02:20:39.073
<v Speaker 1>dose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it seemed like it was part of the </v>

3332
02:20:40.011 --> 02:20:43.240
<v Speaker 1>mushroom that was like potent and other </v>
<v Speaker 1>was just like little short,</v>

3333
02:20:43.730 --> 02:20:47.780
<v Speaker 1>five grams of the potent stuff you need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need the real deal.</v>

3334
02:20:47.900 --> 02:20:50.390
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't wait it out.</v>

3335
02:20:50.930 --> 02:20:51.741
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look,</v>

3336
02:20:51.741 --> 02:20:54.110
<v Speaker 1>you could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depending upon the,</v>

3337
02:20:54.170 --> 02:20:57.440
<v Speaker 1>can you see?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you eat the mushrooms?</v>

3338

<v Speaker 1>Just fucking eat a man like chill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you eat them.</v>

3340
02:21:02.730 --> 02:21:04.640
<v Speaker 1>You're saying this like this is so </v>
<v Speaker 1>alien.</v>

3341
02:21:05.120 --> 02:21:07.850
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just found the taste so horrific.</v>

3342
02:21:07.851 --> 02:21:12.140
<v Speaker 1>That's why I hit it into a delicious big</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mac and the other next time I did it I,</v>

3343

<v Speaker 1>they kind tastes like cardboard or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something or plasticky they don't taste </v>

<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3379
02:22:34.111 --> 02:22:35.520
<v Speaker 3>it's not something I would look forward </v>
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>

3380
02:22:35.521 --> 02:22:37.320
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not like pistachios.</v>

<v Speaker 3>We'll let that,</v>

3385
02:22:44.761 --> 02:22:46.480
<v Speaker 3>we'll let that lie below.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kind of like,</v>

3386
02:22:46.500 --> 02:22:47.333
<v Speaker 3>I do think you're wrong about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just want to get this word wrong </v>

3387
02:22:49.741 --> 02:22:50.574
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's probably some things that you </v>

3388
02:22:51.991 --> 02:22:54.410
<v Speaker 3>enjoy that I don't like obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3389
02:22:54.570 --> 02:22:57.810
<v Speaker 3>How you feel about gefilte fish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3390
02:22:58.050 --> 02:22:59.970
<v Speaker 3>Of all the things that we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>come out of your mouth.</v>

3391
02:23:00.240 --> 02:23:02.580
<v Speaker 3>That was when the last things I can eat </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

3392
02:23:02.640 --> 02:23:03.960
<v Speaker 3>It's not great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3393
02:23:04.110 --> 02:23:05.610
<v Speaker 3>I can agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can eat it,</v>

3394
02:23:05.611 --> 02:23:06.444
<v Speaker 3>but there's a fermented,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the least favorite part is the jelly </v>

3395
02:23:09.061 --> 02:23:09.300
<v Speaker 3>part.</v>

3396
02:23:09.300 --> 02:23:11.550
<v Speaker 3>I get rid of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the actual fish I can deal with,</v>

3397
02:23:11.551 --> 02:23:12.384
<v Speaker 3>there's a fermented shark that people </v>
<v Speaker 3>eat in Iceland that is supposed to be </v>

3398
02:23:15.811 --> 02:23:19.710
<v Speaker 3>fucking horrific for anyone else other </v>
<v Speaker 3>than the people that live in Iceland.</v>

3399
02:23:20.590 --> 02:23:22.200
<v Speaker 3>It was one of the few things that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3400
02:23:22.230 --> 02:23:27.230
<v Speaker 3>Anthony Bordain told me that like was </v>
<v Speaker 3>like truly disgusting that uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3402
02:23:29.310 --> 02:23:30.143

<v Speaker 3>different places and try their local </v>

<v Speaker 3>awful.</v>

3405
02:23:38.010 --> 02:23:38.761
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

3406
02:23:38.761 --> 02:23:39.720
<v Speaker 3>they enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3407
02:23:39.721 --> 02:23:40.554
<v Speaker 3>so it regional,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're saying there's regionalisms when </v>

3408
02:23:42.391 --> 02:23:43.410
<v Speaker 3>it comes to taste?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3409
02:23:43.411 --> 02:23:44.700
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3410
02:23:45.930 --> 02:23:46.763
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm not going to talk about my diet </v>

3411
02:23:47.400 --> 02:23:49.050
<v Speaker 3>cause you're going to hate it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to die.</v>

3412
02:23:49.051 --> 02:23:50.180
<v Speaker 3>What do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you,</v>

3413
02:23:50.250 --> 02:23:51.810
<v Speaker 3>what do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Big macs.</v>

3414
02:23:51.890 --> 02:23:52.723
<v Speaker 3>It's all big MACs.</v>

3415
02:23:52.780 --> 02:23:53.613
<v Speaker 2>It's not all big macs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think a lot of shit you would </v>

3416
02:23:55.881 --> 02:23:56.970
<v Speaker 2>consider shitty food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3417
02:23:56.980 --> 02:23:59.210
<v Speaker 2>Think you're overreacting to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think I'm overreacting?</v>

3418
02:24:00.680 --> 02:24:02.840
<v Speaker 2>Well what is shitty food then?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that's not shitty food.</v>

3419
02:24:03.440 --> 02:24:04.273
<v Speaker 2>I feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like if people during the </v>

3420
02:24:06.021 --> 02:24:06.854
<v Speaker 2>depression could get a 99 cent </v>
<v Speaker 2>cheeseburger when people were so poor </v>

3421
02:24:11.121 --> 02:24:15.650
<v Speaker 2>that they couldn't even afford meat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like big it maybe meet once a month.</v>

3422
02:24:15.740 --> 02:24:17.420
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was the worst of it.</v>

3423
02:24:17.600 --> 02:24:20.660
<v Speaker 2>Some risks get thing that people would </v>
<v Speaker 2>be like,</v>

3424
02:24:20.810 --> 02:24:23.060
<v Speaker 2>they would have thought it was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>greatest thing on earth.</v>

3425
02:24:23.390 --> 02:24:24.223
<v Speaker 2>And I think they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these cheeseburgers that we get be at </v>

3426
02:24:26.451 --> 02:24:28.610
<v Speaker 2>the quarter pounder with cheese,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be it the double,</v>

3427
02:24:28.611 --> 02:24:31.880
<v Speaker 2>double it in and out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be at the uh,</v>

3428
02:24:32.960 --> 02:24:34.760
<v Speaker 2>like a pretty good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're pretty good food.</v>

3429
02:24:34.761 --> 02:24:37.130
<v Speaker 2>I know the factory farmed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

3430
02:24:37.610 --> 02:24:40.630
<v Speaker 2>I get it there that it seems horrible.</v>

3431
02:24:41.050 --> 02:24:42.460
<v Speaker 3>I'll re,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll re ask the question,</v>

3432
02:24:42.820 --> 02:24:45.730
<v Speaker 3>what is bad then if that's what is bad </v>
<v Speaker 3>food?</v>

3434
02:24:47.051 --> 02:24:50.120

<v Speaker 3>I would say food that is uh,</v>

02:24:50.720 --> 02:24:54.880
<v Speaker 3>has gone rotten just has to be boiled </v>
<v Speaker 3>milk.</v>

3436
02:24:54.910 --> 02:24:58.840
<v Speaker 3>It has to be like literally poisonous </v>
<v Speaker 3>and rotting.</v>

3437

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>That's a good question.</v>

3439
02:25:02.261 --> 02:25:03.094
<v Speaker 3>No one's asked me that necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I would consider a health </v>

3440
02:25:05.531 --> 02:25:06.364
<v Speaker 3>conscious.</v>

3441

3442
02:25:12.040 --> 02:25:13.740

3443
02:25:14.320 --> 02:25:17.800
<v Speaker 2>The negativity actions that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>overblown known</v>

3444
02:25:18.020 --> 02:25:18.853
<v Speaker 3>by people that by people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the negative repercussions of eating </v>

<v Speaker 3>That is what you're talking about is </v>

3449
02:25:35.651 --> 02:25:38.830
<v Speaker 3>literally the worst aspects of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>American diet other than sugar.</v>

3450
02:25:38.860 --> 02:25:41.020
<v Speaker 3>I know I've read that you're drinking </v>
<v Speaker 3>sugar.</v>

3455
02:25:51.041 --> 02:25:54.700
<v Speaker 3>39 again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exaggerating.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're only supposed to eat 25 a day.</v>

3459
02:26:05.530 --> 02:26:06.480
<v Speaker 3>A day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3460
02:26:06.490 --> 02:26:07.600
<v Speaker 3>25 gram.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who?</v>

3461
02:26:07.720 --> 02:26:09.510
<v Speaker 3>Who says that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3462
02:26:09.520 --> 02:26:11.830
<v Speaker 3>That's on there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The lambs a protein though.</v>

3463
02:26:11.860 --> 02:26:12.693
<v Speaker 3>That's how much fat in here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much fan in here isn't have Tony's </v>

3464
02:26:14.471 --> 02:26:17.740
<v Speaker 3>back towards to fat zero.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter.</v>

3465
02:26:17.800 --> 02:26:19.600
<v Speaker 3>Protean it's going to go right to your </v>
<v Speaker 3>gut.</v>

3466
02:26:19.720 --> 02:26:20.950
<v Speaker 3>I'll let sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3467
02:26:22.180 --> 02:26:24.460
<v Speaker 3>insulin spike from what you understand </v>
<v Speaker 3>is that we,</v>

3468
02:26:24.461 --> 02:26:26.800
<v Speaker 3>you're going to want to understand that </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you gain weight,</v>

3469
02:26:26.801 --> 02:26:29.290
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't go to one place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It goes all over that way.</v>

3470
02:26:29.320 --> 02:26:32.050
<v Speaker 3>That way you can't spot reduce.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm correct on that.</v>

3471
02:26:32.500 --> 02:26:33.311
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3472
02:26:33.311 --> 02:26:34.144
<v Speaker 3>but some people have an inclination to </v>
<v Speaker 3>gain more gut fat where some will gain </v>

3473
02:26:37.271 --> 02:26:40.360
<v Speaker 3>it and unfortunate areas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do like their ass.</v>

3474
02:26:40.390 --> 02:26:41.223
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people go to the girls worth their </v>

3475
02:26:41.781 --> 02:26:42.810
<v Speaker 3>ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3476
02:26:42.820 --> 02:26:45.670
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is no a consensus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3477
02:26:45.900 --> 02:26:46.631
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3478
02:26:46.631 --> 02:26:47.560
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe me.</v>

3479
02:26:47.860 --> 02:26:51.670
<v Speaker 3>You're not the only one that is not </v>
<v Speaker 3>happy with my diet.</v>

3480
02:26:51.730 --> 02:26:53.080
<v Speaker 3>Who else isn't happy with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dot.</v>

3481
02:26:53.780 --> 02:26:55.240
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people who are well read,</v>

3482
02:26:55.810 --> 02:26:58.570
<v Speaker 3>people understand diet people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>Dietitians.</v>

3483
02:26:58.630 --> 02:27:00.850
<v Speaker 3>So back to her solid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the you.</v>

3484
02:27:01.300 --> 02:27:02.133
<v Speaker 3>So all this stuff when you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about like pizza and cheeseburgers and </v>

3485
02:27:05.231 --> 02:27:06.130
<v Speaker 3>sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

3486
02:27:06.160 --> 02:27:09.160
<v Speaker 3>that's the kind of things that people </v>
<v Speaker 3>had ever had.</v>

3487
02:27:09.161 --> 02:27:10.900
<v Speaker 3>Chinese food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like that.</v>

3488
02:27:11.430 --> 02:27:13.420
<v Speaker 3>It's delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's the reason why it's popular.</v>

3489
02:27:13.540 --> 02:27:14.740
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3490
02:27:14.770 --> 02:27:17.530
<v Speaker 3>I like delicious things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just basic tick.</v>

3491
02:27:17.890 --> 02:27:18.723
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>me too.</v>

3492
02:27:18.910 --> 02:27:19.743
<v Speaker 3>I just don't allow myself to have them </v>
<v Speaker 3>very often as it's not more disciplined </v>

3493
02:27:22.811 --> 02:27:24.460
<v Speaker 3>than I am.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>

3494
02:27:24.800 --> 02:27:26.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably.</v>

3495
02:27:26.350 --> 02:27:27.183
<v Speaker 3>I think that's been sort of the theme,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the theme of my life as far as like </v>

3496
02:27:30.551 --> 02:27:34.780
<v Speaker 3>getting things done has always been </v>
<v Speaker 3>about forcing myself to work.</v>

3497
02:27:34.900 --> 02:27:36.310
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's uh,</v>

3498
02:27:36.370 --> 02:27:38.350
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think especially Comedians,</v>

3499
02:27:38.351 --> 02:27:41.500
<v Speaker 3>one of the things about what we do is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's so open ended.</v>

3500
02:27:41.501 --> 02:27:43.060
<v Speaker 3>Like no one can tell us what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3501
02:27:43.330 --> 02:27:45.970
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how your schedule works,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but me,</v>

3502
02:27:45.971 --> 02:27:50.140
<v Speaker 3>I call into the comedy store on Monday </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I can decide how many days I want to</v>

3503
02:27:50.141 --> 02:27:51.520
<v Speaker 3>put in for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can say,</v>

3504
02:27:51.550 --> 02:27:53.980
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll do Tuesday and Friday,</v>

3505
02:27:53.981 --> 02:27:55.810
<v Speaker 3>Saturday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'll take Wednesday and Thursday off.</v>

3506
02:27:55.830 --> 02:27:57.040
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's totally up to me.</v>

3507
02:27:57.070 --> 02:27:59.380
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's how we all are.</v>

3508
02:27:59.381 --> 02:28:01.840
<v Speaker 3>We can decide like when to work and when</v>
<v Speaker 3>not to work.</v>

3509
02:28:02.260 --> 02:28:03.093
<v Speaker 3>But there's a big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a direct connection between </v>

3510
02:28:06.610 --> 02:28:11.140
<v Speaker 3>forcing yourself to write more and </v>
<v Speaker 3>perform more and your act getting better</v>

3511
02:28:11.320 --> 02:28:13.600
<v Speaker 3>and you're getting more work and your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

3512
02:28:13.601 --> 02:28:16.240
<v Speaker 3>your comedy career progressing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so for me,</v>

3513
02:28:17.020 --> 02:28:17.853
<v Speaker 3>the discipline that I applied to s two </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting and martial arts and other </v>

3514
02:28:22.311 --> 02:28:24.830
<v Speaker 3>things and to continue to stay fit and </v>
<v Speaker 3>work out,</v>

3515
02:28:25.130 --> 02:28:26.300
<v Speaker 3>I applied to comedy too.</v>

3516
02:28:26.330 --> 02:28:29.730
<v Speaker 3>I just make yourself go do the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the,</v>

3517
02:28:29.930 --> 02:28:30.763
<v Speaker 3>the natural inclination of really funny </v>
<v Speaker 3>people is often to fuck off is often to </v>

3518
02:28:34.851 --> 02:28:35.684
<v Speaker 3>be lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I don't think that they're mutually </v>

3519
02:28:36.981 --> 02:28:40.700
<v Speaker 3>exclusive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you can be disciplined but still</v>

3520
02:28:40.701 --> 02:28:41.534
<v Speaker 3>have the same sort of comedic instincts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just have to know when to turn it </v>

3521
02:28:44.221 --> 02:28:46.490
<v Speaker 3>out and when to turn it off and when it </v>
<v Speaker 3>benefits you.</v>

3522
02:28:47.450 --> 02:28:50.790
<v Speaker 3>I think you'd done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

3523
02:28:51.890 --> 02:28:54.340
<v Speaker 3>Like then you go off on this things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3524
02:28:55.340 --> 02:28:57.170
<v Speaker 3>I agree with the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree with you 100%.</v>

3525
02:28:57.200 --> 02:29:01.220
<v Speaker 3>I admire your discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I'm not as disciplined to do</v>

3526
02:29:01.221 --> 02:29:02.054
<v Speaker 3>you want a little more discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Although people who look at me are </v>

3527
02:29:04.131 --> 02:29:06.850
<v Speaker 3>always like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you accomplish more because of the Dayak</v>

3528
02:29:06.870 --> 02:29:09.470
<v Speaker 3>they did things that go on the road.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just stand up.</v>

3529
02:29:09.830 --> 02:29:11.600
<v Speaker 3>I write books,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I write articles.</v>

3530
02:29:11.840 --> 02:29:13.430
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>

3531
02:29:13.550 --> 02:29:14.383
<v Speaker 3>I know I'm not disciplined,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're more disciplined than a lot </v>

3532
02:29:17.721 --> 02:29:18.590
<v Speaker 3>of other comics.</v>

3533
02:29:19.460 --> 02:29:20.720
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just know me,</v>

3534
02:29:20.780 --> 02:29:24.200
<v Speaker 3>but we all know comics like especially </v>
<v Speaker 3>are just getting high all day.</v>

3535
02:29:24.201 --> 02:29:28.520
<v Speaker 3>I know that's not only that we all know </v>
<v Speaker 3>the tragic stories of the guys who wrote</v>

3536
02:29:28.521 --> 02:29:32.690
<v Speaker 3>an hour in like 1996 or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and never fucking adjusted it.</v>

3537
02:29:32.691 --> 02:29:33.524
<v Speaker 3>And they had real promise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's guys that are doing the same </v>

3538
02:29:35.931 --> 02:29:39.590
<v Speaker 3>fucking jokes that you and I both know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've been doing the same jokes for 20</v>

3539
02:29:39.591 --> 02:29:40.424
<v Speaker 3>years and they still are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you can go and catch them at the </v>

3540
02:29:43.041 --> 02:29:43.874
<v Speaker 3>fucking laugh factory tomorrow night and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll tell a joke from the late </v>

3541
02:29:46.910 --> 02:29:47.660
<v Speaker 3>nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3542
02:29:47.660 --> 02:29:48.680
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's those guys,</v>

3543
02:29:48.710 --> 02:29:52.280
<v Speaker 3>they exist and a lot of those guys had </v>
<v Speaker 3>massive potential.</v>

3544
02:29:52.550 --> 02:29:55.490
<v Speaker 3>Like they were really good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think,</v>

3545
02:29:55.550 --> 02:29:56.383
<v Speaker 3>I know you're blaming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of it is obviously discipline and </v>

3546
02:29:59.931 --> 02:30:01.760
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think it goes back to what we said</v>

3547
02:30:01.761 --> 02:30:05.600
<v Speaker 3>earlier about the risk of doing new </v>
<v Speaker 3>material for sure.</v>

3548
02:30:05.690 --> 02:30:07.860
<v Speaker 3>But he's just part of disciplines when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you understand.</v>

3549
02:30:07.861 --> 02:30:10.670
<v Speaker 3>But there's a pain involved with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And maybe with your,</v>

3550
02:30:11.210 --> 02:30:12.043
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just hypothesizing here that if </v>

3551
02:30:14.151 --> 02:30:18.980
<v Speaker 3>you're a comedian and you love the </v>
<v Speaker 3>attention and the approval,</v>

3552
02:30:19.220 --> 02:30:20.053
<v Speaker 3>that that overwhelms your desire to </v>
<v Speaker 3>write new material and go through that </v>

3553
02:30:24.561 --> 02:30:26.570
<v Speaker 3>pain process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3554
02:30:27.030 --> 02:30:29.870
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's definitely some excuses that you</v>

3555
02:30:29.871 --> 02:30:31.570
<v Speaker 3>can make for why people don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3556
02:30:31.850 --> 02:30:34.400
<v Speaker 3>I think that's why Eddie Murphy doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>do stand up by the way.</v>

3557
02:30:34.790 --> 02:30:37.610
<v Speaker 3>Well I think he's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing where he got caught with those</v>

3558
02:30:37.611 --> 02:30:40.040
<v Speaker 3>transvestite prostitutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not wet.</v>

3559
02:30:40.041 --> 02:30:42.260
<v Speaker 3>I think it is at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's 100% where it is.</v>

3560
02:30:42.261 --> 02:30:44.690
<v Speaker 3>Cause that's when he stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3561
02:30:44.691 --> 02:30:47.840
<v Speaker 3>we get stopped before then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's stopped doing standup before then,</v>

3562
02:30:47.910 --> 02:30:48.820
<v Speaker 3>honey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3563
02:30:49.570 --> 02:30:51.230
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's had been caught a few times.</v>

3564
02:30:51.500 --> 02:30:52.333
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This idol,</v>

3565
02:30:52.550 --> 02:30:55.850
<v Speaker 3>this is not a mat out he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nettie Murphy and doubting anything.</v>

3566
02:30:55.890 --> 02:30:57.620
<v Speaker 3>This is all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is all news.</v>

3567
02:30:58.240 --> 02:31:00.140
<v Speaker 3>It happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought that happened just once.</v>

3568
02:31:00.950 --> 02:31:03.800
<v Speaker 3>I have a friend who's a cop and I know </v>
<v Speaker 3>some things.</v>

3569
02:31:04.290 --> 02:31:05.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you know what they call them?</v>

3570
02:31:05.361 --> 02:31:08.170
<v Speaker 3>Dragons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your police officer friends,</v>

3571

<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>

3601
02:32:17.341 --> 02:32:18.630
<v Speaker 1>Shot on an iphone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are,</v>

3602
02:32:19.140 --> 02:32:21.030
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a couple of dragons as you'd like</v>

3603
02:32:21.031 --> 02:32:22.830
<v Speaker 1>to call.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never heard that expression before.</v>

3604
02:32:23.190 --> 02:32:25.980
<v Speaker 1>And it's interesting little low budget </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>

3605
02:32:26.580 --> 02:32:27.413
<v Speaker 1>Well at least fucking phones are way </v>
<v Speaker 1>better than the film cameras that they </v>

3606
02:32:30.331 --> 02:32:32.310
<v Speaker 1>use 20 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we,</v>

3607
02:32:32.311 --> 02:32:33.144
<v Speaker 1>you can get off of a phone now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The images and the crystal clear images </v>

3608
02:32:36.571 --> 02:32:40.260
<v Speaker 1>off of just a regular iphone six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're fucking phenomenal.</v>

3609
02:32:40.500 --> 02:32:41.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no question.</v>

3610
02:32:41.620 --> 02:32:42.453
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know if they're better than </v>

3611
02:32:43.690 --> 02:32:44.523
<v Speaker 1>a good camera with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the lenses that were amazing on </v>

3612
02:32:46.921 --> 02:32:47.754
<v Speaker 1>those cameras.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I guarantee you you could get a </v>

3613
02:32:50.701 --> 02:32:53.970
<v Speaker 1>video camera from a video camera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3614
02:32:54.060 --> 02:32:54.841
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3615
02:32:54.841 --> 02:32:55.890
<v Speaker 1>you mean like a film camera?</v>

3616
02:32:55.890 --> 02:32:57.360
<v Speaker 1>Like the camera?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3617
02:32:57.900 --> 02:33:02.430
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I meant like something nice video.</v>

3618
02:33:02.610 --> 02:33:04.630
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting because when nobody was</v>

3619
02:33:04.631 --> 02:33:06.150
<v Speaker 1>one of the whole thing on this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3620
02:33:06.240 --> 02:33:09.450
<v Speaker 1>But you could do that pretty well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I actually think the five,</v>

3621
02:33:09.720 --> 02:33:11.340
<v Speaker 1>what's interesting about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3622
02:33:12.330 --> 02:33:13.163
<v Speaker 1>like phones and digital is that it shows</v>
<v Speaker 1>you the entire image as opposed to </v>

3623
02:33:18.360 --> 02:33:21.390
<v Speaker 1>focusing on the center or the for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>front.</v>

3624
02:33:21.391 --> 02:33:22.830
<v Speaker 1>And then everything in the background is</v>
<v Speaker 1>blurry,</v>

3625
02:33:23.100 --> 02:33:25.170
<v Speaker 1>which is what a lot of people like about</v>
<v Speaker 1>film,</v>

3626
02:33:25.440 --> 02:33:26.273
<v Speaker 1>about doing movies with film is that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>would have the shallow focus field </v>

3627
02:33:29.520 --> 02:33:30.331
<v Speaker 1>yelling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3628
02:33:30.331 --> 02:33:32.070
<v Speaker 1>And it's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really keeps your,</v>

3629
02:33:32.100 --> 02:33:35.610
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like the way you think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see things in real life.</v>

3630
02:33:35.790 --> 02:33:37.610
<v Speaker 1>Like if I'm looking at you in real life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3631
02:33:37.740 --> 02:33:39.570
<v Speaker 1>I note that there's background behind </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

3632
02:33:39.571 --> 02:33:41.220
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not really seeing it very </v>
<v Speaker 1>clearly.</v>

3633
02:33:41.230 --> 02:33:41.940
<v Speaker 1>I see you.</v>

3634
02:33:41.940 --> 02:33:43.980
<v Speaker 1>And then I see Elvis Presley,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3635
02:33:44.250 --> 02:33:46.080
<v Speaker 1>Visiting President Nixon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3636
02:33:46.230 --> 02:33:48.690
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever see Presley perform?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

3637
02:33:48.691 --> 02:33:51.180
<v Speaker 1>Not Live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

3638
02:33:51.590 --> 02:33:52.950
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I was just,</v>

3639
02:33:53.100 --> 02:33:54.510
<v Speaker 1>do you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just released that movie.</v>

3640
02:33:54.511 --> 02:33:55.344

<v Speaker 1>a concert film of his comeback and a in </v>

<v Speaker 1>1970 yeah,</v>

3643
02:34:05.680 --> 02:34:06.513
<v Speaker 1>digitally remastered it and that was at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the movies recently and they had a </v>

3644
02:34:09.210 --> 02:34:10.043

3649

3653
02:34:27.820 --> 02:34:28.653
<v Speaker 6>they didn't even like you think about </v>
<v Speaker 6>like how much bigger a star he was then </v>

3654
02:34:32.771 --> 02:34:33.604
<v Speaker 6>anybody could ever be a star.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Today is cause like people are used to </v>

<v Speaker 6>it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it wasn't that it was,</v>

3696
02:36:17.230 --> 02:36:19.210
<v Speaker 6>it was not much history to it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3697
02:36:19.240 --> 02:36:20.073
<v Speaker 6>television had only been around for a </v>
<v Speaker 6>few decades when in the 1950s I mean </v>

3698
02:36:24.521 --> 02:36:27.610
<v Speaker 6>it's super new.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then movies before that,</v>

3699
02:36:27.850 --> 02:36:28.540
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we,</v>

3700
02:36:28.540 --> 02:36:29.373
<v Speaker 6>before you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the silent movies and then you're only </v>

3701
02:36:31.601 --> 02:36:33.970
<v Speaker 6>talking about like a hundred years </v>
<v Speaker 6>maximum,</v>

3702
02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:34.600
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3703
02:36:34.600 --> 02:36:35.433
<v Speaker 6>So this is all a completely new </v>
<v Speaker 6>experience that these girls are seeing </v>

3706
02:36:44.861 --> 02:36:47.080
<v Speaker 6>the whole deal.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And the reaction to them,</v>

3707
02:36:47.081 --> 02:36:47.914
<v Speaker 6>it's almost like their brains can't </v>
<v Speaker 6>process it and they're screaming and </v>

3708
02:36:52.241 --> 02:36:53.074

<v Speaker 6>bizarre things about watching elvis is </v>

3709
02:36:56.591 --> 02:37:00.340
<v Speaker 6>watching the reaction to Elvis that </v>
<v Speaker 6>these people have the audience.</v>

3710
02:37:00.360 --> 02:37:01.360

<v Speaker 6>second?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You don't have to ask me if you can talk</v>

3714
02:37:07.991 --> 02:37:08.320
<v Speaker 6>about,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

3715
02:37:08.320 --> 02:37:10.330
<v Speaker 6>I'm not allowed to just talk.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just talk.</v>

3716
02:37:10.331 --> 02:37:11.164
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

3717
02:37:12.390 --> 02:37:13.120
<v Speaker 8>yeah.</v>

3718
02:37:13.120 --> 02:37:13.980
<v Speaker 6>You know the book,</v>

3719
02:37:16.340 --> 02:37:17.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm silly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

3720
02:37:17.780 --> 02:37:20.000
<v Speaker 2>She knows the book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>

3721
02:37:20.310 --> 02:37:22.850
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's written by the guy about 10,000</v>

3722
02:37:22.851 --> 02:37:24.230
<v Speaker 2>hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need to do 10,000</v>

3723
02:37:24.231 --> 02:37:26.630
<v Speaker 2>hours to be good at something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was that Malcolm Gladwell.</v>

3724
02:37:26.660 --> 02:37:28.370
<v Speaker 2>Malcolm Gladwell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3725
02:37:28.900 --> 02:37:31.130
<v Speaker 2>And it's the one after blank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3726
02:37:31.450 --> 02:37:32.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Know that.</v>

3727
02:37:32.820 --> 02:37:36.980
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Elvis is the opposite of the 10,000</v>

3728
02:37:36.981 --> 02:37:39.680
<v Speaker 2>hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The opposite.</v>

3729
02:37:40.400 --> 02:37:42.160
<v Speaker 2>Because if you go back and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>

3730
02:37:42.230 --> 02:37:43.310
<v Speaker 2>what was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how did Elvis like,</v>

3733
02:37:46.790 --> 02:37:51.050
<v Speaker 2>Not in a band around Memphis,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Nah.</v>

3816
02:40:41.280 --> 02:40:45.630
<v Speaker 2>Then they played the first guitar solo </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they got dunked in den.</v>

3817
02:40:46.170 --> 02:40:47.430
<v Speaker 2>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that part,</v>

3818
02:40:47.431 --> 02:40:50.100
<v Speaker 2>the opera part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guess what happens at that part?</v>

3819
02:40:50.130 --> 02:40:54.150
<v Speaker 2>What they run offstage?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Queen leaves the stage.</v>

3820
02:40:54.151 --> 02:40:54.984
<v Speaker 2>They play the record.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just at the end and then the whole </v>

3821
02:40:56.911 --> 02:41:01.911
<v Speaker 2>opera park figure [inaudible] I'm just </v>
<v Speaker 2>up a boy if I'm up over all of that.</v>

3822
02:41:04.260 --> 02:41:07.800
<v Speaker 2>And then when they come back for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>guitar so damned and an end,</v>

3823
02:41:07.801 --> 02:41:10.860
<v Speaker 2>they don't learn and then they come back</v>
<v Speaker 2>on stage and sing the rest of the show.</v>

3824
02:41:11.220 --> 02:41:12.390
<v Speaker 2>The song.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

3825
02:41:12.630 --> 02:41:15.750
<v Speaker 2>It's the craziest thing I'd ever seen </v>
<v Speaker 2>Madison Square.</v>

3826
02:41:15.751 --> 02:41:17.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I turn to the person that I was like,</v>

3827
02:41:18.180 --> 02:41:20.370
<v Speaker 2>you realize there's no one on stage </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now?</v>

3828
02:41:21.270 --> 02:41:22.103
<v Speaker 2>No one on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're just playing that opera </v>

3829
02:41:23.821 --> 02:41:24.770
<v Speaker 2>part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

3830
02:41:25.200 --> 02:41:27.180
<v Speaker 2>Like a song of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wonder why they do that.</v>

3831
02:41:27.720 --> 02:41:28.553
<v Speaker 2>Cause it vocally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I assume we would just be impossible to </v>

3832
02:41:31.140 --> 02:41:33.990
<v Speaker 2>come near what's on that record,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3833
02:41:34.140 --> 02:41:35.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gas.</v>

3834
02:41:35.860 --> 02:41:36.840
<v Speaker 2>You liked that song,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3835
02:41:36.870 --> 02:41:37.703
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I would imagine they would want to </v>

3836
02:41:38.790 --> 02:41:39.623
<v Speaker 2>replicate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean opera singers can replicate </v>

3837
02:41:41.101 --> 02:41:42.390
<v Speaker 2>opera.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3838
02:41:42.391 --> 02:41:44.710
<v Speaker 2>But it's so multitrack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

3839
02:41:44.920 --> 02:41:45.760
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3840
02:41:45.810 --> 02:41:48.970
<v Speaker 2>That's did it in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3841
02:41:49.020 --> 02:41:51.450
<v Speaker 2>I will not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you,</v>

3842
02:41:51.530 --> 02:41:55.440
<v Speaker 2>which you would think that they would </v>
<v Speaker 2>like at least perform part of it.</v>

3843
02:41:57.120 --> 02:41:59.490
<v Speaker 2>What they do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do the the easy.</v>

3844
02:41:59.520 --> 02:42:00.353
<v Speaker 2>Know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>While they're doing it while all the </v>

3845
02:42:01.810 --> 02:42:05.910
<v Speaker 2>hallways at least participate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Run offstage.</v>

3846
02:42:06.020 --> 02:42:06.853
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe like a cigarette break for little </v>

3847
02:42:08.311 --> 02:42:09.180
<v Speaker 2>girls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like,</v>

3848
02:42:09.181 --> 02:42:11.490
<v Speaker 2>we can't do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're out of here.</v>

3849
02:42:11.880 --> 02:42:14.190
<v Speaker 2>And then they come back and he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty good singer.</v>

3850
02:42:14.480 --> 02:42:16.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy was a good singer.</v>

3851
02:42:16.450 --> 02:42:17.890
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

<v Speaker 2>all right.</v>

3855
02:42:26.371 --> 02:42:27.690

3856
02:42:30.200 --> 02:42:32.070
<v Speaker 2>It's going to send him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I said okay.</v>

3895
02:43:56.051 --> 02:43:58.780
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unprecedented,</v>

3896
02:43:58.840 --> 02:43:59.673
<v Speaker 3>unprecedented.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I don't buy it and I'm not going to buy </v>
<v Speaker 3>it and I don't care.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I listen,</v>

3902
02:44:10.930 --> 02:44:13.990
<v Speaker 3>were we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a really easily defensible one.</v>

3903
02:44:14.320 --> 02:44:15.153
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about a ridiculous human </v>

3904
02:44:16.271 --> 02:44:17.110
<v Speaker 3>being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3905
02:44:17.150 --> 02:44:19.330
<v Speaker 3>Not just ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but patently ridiculous.</v>

3906
02:44:19.390 --> 02:44:20.223
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A guy who is a transsexual jeff dye was </v>

3907
02:44:22.571 --> 02:44:23.351
<v Speaker 3>the comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3908
02:44:23.351 --> 02:44:24.910
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to do each joke later.</v>

3909
02:44:24.911 --> 02:44:25.744
<v Speaker 3>Transsexual comedian who comedian </v>
<v Speaker 3>transsexual man became a woman and </v>

3910
02:44:30.851 --> 02:44:33.910
<v Speaker 3>doesn't believe in gay marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he's ridiculous person right there.</v>

3911
02:44:34.240 --> 02:44:36.370
<v Speaker 3>And when on Ellen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when Ellen confronted him,</v>

3912
02:44:36.371 --> 02:44:37.450
<v Speaker 3>did you ever watch that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

3913
02:44:37.510 --> 02:44:39.610
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty fucking awkward because you </v>
<v Speaker 3>realize,</v>

3914
02:44:39.611 --> 02:44:41.200
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how stupid he really is.</v>

3915
02:44:41.230 --> 02:44:44.320
<v Speaker 3>He's a dumb man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not smart as a woman,</v>

3916
02:44:44.321 --> 02:44:45.580
<v Speaker 3>as a man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

3917
02:44:45.580 --> 02:44:49.930
<v Speaker 3>But when Ellen's talk knew about gay </v>
<v Speaker 3>rights and about gay marriage about,</v>

3918
02:44:50.140 --> 02:44:53.500
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't you think that you as a person </v>
<v Speaker 3>who's been marginalized your whole life,</v>

3919
02:44:53.501 --> 02:44:54.334
<v Speaker 3>you would support his argument was or </v>
<v Speaker 3>her argument whenever you want to call </v>

3920
02:44:57.010 --> 02:45:00.310
<v Speaker 3>while voice from tron for short of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>traditionalist like no,</v>

3921
02:45:00.311 --> 02:45:02.770
<v Speaker 3>you're not a traditional,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a fucking man with nail Polish on</v>

3922
02:45:02.771 --> 02:45:07.150
<v Speaker 3>and address who's now a woman and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>had your jaw shave down to be a woman.</v>

3923
02:45:07.151 --> 02:45:10.480
<v Speaker 3>You have fake tits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not fucking traditional at all.</v>

3924
02:45:10.540 --> 02:45:14.290
<v Speaker 3>And that's a shitty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stupid excuse for being a bigot.</v>

3925
02:45:14.710 --> 02:45:15.543
<v Speaker 3>Like you can't say that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>support gay marriage because you're a </v>

3926
02:45:18.191 --> 02:45:21.040
<v Speaker 3>traditional woman cause you're not a </v>
<v Speaker 3>traditional woman.</v>

3927
02:45:21.430 --> 02:45:22.263
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I know it says a bunch of </v>

3928
02:45:23.831 --> 02:45:27.580
<v Speaker 3>things about him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't hold that position.</v>

3929
02:45:27.610 --> 02:45:32.230
<v Speaker 3>You feel gives you more latitude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It drives me nuts.</v>

3930
02:45:32.580 --> 02:45:33.413
<v Speaker 3>The only thing that we're supposed to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>paying attention to when you're looking </v>

3931
02:45:35.801 --> 02:45:38.290
<v Speaker 3>at someone who's doing something that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously odd,</v>

3932
02:45:38.680 --> 02:45:39.331
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3933
02:45:39.331 --> 02:45:41.770
<v Speaker 3>You're not supposed to make fun of it </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's a thing about gender.</v>

3934
02:45:41.950 --> 02:45:45.170
<v Speaker 3>Why is gender all of a sudden the only </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

3935
02:45:45.180 --> 02:45:49.060
<v Speaker 3>like this is the only category that </v>
<v Speaker 3>precludes you from humor.</v>

3936
02:45:49.510 --> 02:45:51.400
<v Speaker 3>Like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're supposed to be,</v>

3937
02:45:51.490 --> 02:45:53.230
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're unsafe space,</v>

3938
02:45:53.290 --> 02:45:53.801
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've,</v>

3939
02:45:53.801 --> 02:45:54.634
<v Speaker 3>you've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've,</v>

3940
02:45:54.670 --> 02:45:56.980
<v Speaker 3>you're holding on to base.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm touching base.</v>

3941
02:45:56.981 --> 02:45:58.690
<v Speaker 3>You can't get me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm touching base.</v>

3942
02:45:58.840 --> 02:45:59.673
<v Speaker 3>This is gender that I reject that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that over time we're going </v>

3943
02:46:03.751 --> 02:46:04.584
<v Speaker 3>to realize how ridiculous we were acting</v>
<v Speaker 3>with this preposterous person who's </v>

3944
02:46:07.811 --> 02:46:10.070
<v Speaker 3>essentially a male cardiac,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an</v>

3945
02:46:10.100 --> 02:46:12.290
<v Speaker 6>older male card.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean that's what the fuck he is.</v>

3946
02:46:12.320 --> 02:46:13.153
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

3947
02:46:13.280 --> 02:46:15.590
<v Speaker 6>And on top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>everybody forgets.</v>

3948
02:46:15.591 --> 02:46:16.424
<v Speaker 6>He killed a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He fucking slammed into some lady cause </v>

3949
02:46:18.261 --> 02:46:19.094
<v Speaker 6>he wasn't paying attention,</v>
<v Speaker 6>knocked her into oncoming traffic and </v>

3950
02:46:20.961 --> 02:46:21.794
<v Speaker 6>she died.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And everybody's just sort of whisked </v>

3951
02:46:23.481 --> 02:46:24.314
<v Speaker 6>that away.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then he wins an Sba award and he's </v>

3952
02:46:26.390 --> 02:46:27.223
<v Speaker 6>walking around with fucking drapes </v>
<v Speaker 6>flowing the curtains and the breeze and </v>

3953
02:46:31.161 --> 02:46:31.994
<v Speaker 6>there's a helicopter flying over.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And when he's walking around his house </v>

3954
02:46:34.161 --> 02:46:36.320
<v Speaker 6>and his heels,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's preposterous.</v>

3955
02:46:36.440 --> 02:46:37.273
<v Speaker 6>This is a preposterous person.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is not his standard subject of </v>

3956
02:46:42.231 --> 02:46:44.300
<v Speaker 6>transsexuals who,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3957
02:46:44.301 --> 02:46:45.134
<v Speaker 6>need to be respected for the choices.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Of course you should respect people for </v>

3958
02:46:47.691 --> 02:46:49.010
<v Speaker 6>their choices.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Of course,</v>

3959
02:46:49.011 --> 02:46:52.460
<v Speaker 6>people should be able to express </v>
<v Speaker 6>themselves in any way they want.</v>

3960
02:46:52.461 --> 02:46:56.810
<v Speaker 6>You could be a heterosexual man who is </v>
<v Speaker 6>completely into women but likes dressing</v>

3961
02:46:56.811 --> 02:46:58.700
<v Speaker 6>up like a woman and I support that too.</v>

3962
02:46:59.030 --> 02:46:59.863
<v Speaker 6>You can say you're a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He was a woman when he was on the Diane </v>

3963
02:47:02.180 --> 02:47:05.030
<v Speaker 6>Sawyer show or he was a man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He said he wants to be him.</v>

3964
02:47:05.270 --> 02:47:08.870
<v Speaker 6>He wants to be called [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then immediately after the attention</v>

3965
02:47:08.871 --> 02:47:09.704
<v Speaker 6>that he got from that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he gets massive surgery and changes his </v>

3966
02:47:11.571 --> 02:47:15.230
<v Speaker 6>name to Caitlyn.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is a ridiculous person,</v>

3967
02:47:15.800 --> 02:47:16.633
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is a person that's infatuated with </v>

3968
02:47:18.770 --> 02:47:23.150
<v Speaker 6>attention for no reason,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not attention for their art,</v>

3969
02:47:23.151 --> 02:47:27.500
<v Speaker 6>not attention for their philosophies or </v>
<v Speaker 6>for their thoughts or for their work.</v>

3970
02:47:27.740 --> 02:47:30.200
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is a person who's a infatuated with</v>

3971
02:47:30.210 --> 02:47:35.090
<v Speaker 6>attention for no reason.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's why I think you're supposed to be</v>

3972
02:47:35.091 --> 02:47:36.140
<v Speaker 6>able to make fun of this person.</v>

3973
02:47:36.480 --> 02:47:41.160
<v Speaker 2>I think my feeling is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>

3974
02:47:41.161 --> 02:47:43.950
<v Speaker 2>I am,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know my act not edgy at all.</v>

3975
02:47:44.130 --> 02:47:44.970
<v Speaker 2>Dot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Edge.</v>

3976
02:47:44.971 --> 02:47:46.200
<v Speaker 2>React.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well</v>

3977
02:47:46.460 --> 02:47:48.740
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you go after some stuff.</v>

3978
02:47:48.800 --> 02:47:49.633
<v Speaker 6>I loved your bit about actors.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I fucking love that because I've always </v>

3979
02:47:53.301 --> 02:47:54.134
<v Speaker 6>felt the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You did a bit that I was clapping and </v>

3980
02:47:56.331 --> 02:48:00.920
<v Speaker 6>laughing out about actors being able to </v>
<v Speaker 6>cry on cue and you were like,</v>

3981
02:48:00.921 --> 02:48:03.800
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's because they're fucking crazy.</v>

3982
02:48:04.340 --> 02:48:09.290
<v Speaker 6>Like these are massively damaged people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like trust me,</v>

3983
02:48:09.291 --> 02:48:10.790
<v Speaker 6>I know them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I work with them.</v>

3984
02:48:10.791 --> 02:48:11.960
<v Speaker 6>You did this really cool.</v>

3985
02:48:13.130 --> 02:48:14.010
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

3986
02:48:14.240 --> 02:48:14.981
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

3987
02:48:14.981 --> 02:48:17.150
<v Speaker 2>But that's his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's his like his head.</v>

3988
02:48:17.330 --> 02:48:19.430
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you went in the,</v>

3989
02:48:19.431 --> 02:48:20.264
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew when all it does is completely </v>

3990
02:48:22.511 --> 02:48:23.344
<v Speaker 2>benign,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have to work with them all the </v>

3991
02:48:24.251 --> 02:48:25.240
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

3992
02:48:25.241 --> 02:48:25.900
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

3993
02:48:25.900 --> 02:48:28.180
<v Speaker 2>I know what it was just about because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>went to acting school,</v>

3994
02:48:28.210 --> 02:48:28.940
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3995
02:48:28.940 --> 02:48:29.773
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And patently the most ridiculous people </v>

3996
02:48:32.801 --> 02:48:35.260
<v Speaker 2>and all of show business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The actor without a doubt.</v>

3997
02:48:35.530 --> 02:48:36.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're here.</v>

3998
02:48:36.010 --> 02:48:36.830
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want,</v>

3999
02:48:36.830 --> 02:48:38.890
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seinfeld does a great,</v>

4000
02:48:39.130 --> 02:48:41.440
<v Speaker 2>just a great takedown actors all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

4001
02:48:41.441 --> 02:48:43.330
<v Speaker 2>He says like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are they?</v>

4002
02:48:43.480 --> 02:48:45.730
<v Speaker 2>Why are we giving them awards?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

4003
02:48:45.880 --> 02:48:48.290
<v Speaker 2>they're told what to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where to stand,</v>

4004
02:48:48.310 --> 02:48:52.330
<v Speaker 2>but they don't have to do Anik,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are they getting an award?</v>

4005
02:48:52.720 --> 02:48:53.680
<v Speaker 2>It's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's great.</v>

4006
02:48:53.700 --> 02:48:55.060
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4007
02:48:55.061 --> 02:48:56.470
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I learned that in acting school.</v>

4008
02:48:56.471 --> 02:48:58.870
<v Speaker 2>Then it'll be like the more emotional </v>
<v Speaker 2>leeward,</v>

4009
02:48:59.120 --> 02:49:01.450
<v Speaker 2>the better actor you were like it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>true.</v>

4010
02:49:01.530 --> 02:49:02.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's true.</v>

4011
02:49:02.260 --> 02:49:05.380
<v Speaker 2>The more emotionally imbalanced,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more the whole thing,</v>

4012
02:49:05.500 --> 02:49:06.333
<v Speaker 2>the less grounded you are in reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're creating this whole thing that </v>

4013
02:49:09.270 --> 02:49:11.380
<v Speaker 2>you can really become a great actor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4014
02:49:12.630 --> 02:49:16.880
<v Speaker 2>I knew that my point was it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if Katelyn wasn't all of it,</v>

4015
02:49:16.910 --> 02:49:21.750
<v Speaker 2>even if she was pro gay marriage or not </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of the Kardashians,</v>

4016
02:49:21.990 --> 02:49:25.380
<v Speaker 2>I still feel like it's part of life and </v>
<v Speaker 2>can be made fun of.</v>

4017
02:49:25.470 --> 02:49:26.750
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

4018
02:49:27.120 --> 02:49:27.953
<v Speaker 2>this is a thing I have a problem with </v>
<v Speaker 2>and which is this thing about punching </v>

4019
02:49:32.491 --> 02:49:33.324
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you have any idea what I'm talking </v>

4020
02:49:34.111 --> 02:49:34.470
<v Speaker 2>about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4021
02:49:34.470 --> 02:49:39.180
<v Speaker 2>But this is all nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all nonsense to make fun of things.</v>

4022
02:49:39.181 --> 02:49:40.350
<v Speaker 2>You're allowed to make fun of </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

4023
02:49:40.380 --> 02:49:43.710
<v Speaker 2>More fun of myself as my main thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like you're letting me find,</v>

4024
02:49:43.711 --> 02:49:46.310
<v Speaker 2>I think it's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course that's a Gibson,</v>

4025
02:49:47.130 --> 02:49:49.590
<v Speaker 6>this hole punching down thing is a </v>
<v Speaker 6>symptom.</v>

4026
02:49:49.620 --> 02:49:50.453
<v Speaker 6>It's all coming out of social media.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a consequence of people being able </v>

4027
02:49:52.741 --> 02:49:53.574
<v Speaker 6>to criticize and get upset about things </v>
<v Speaker 6>and become recreationally outraged and </v>

4028
02:49:57.871 --> 02:49:59.370
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well there's some punching down.</v>

4029
02:49:59.371 --> 02:50:00.204
<v Speaker 6>It's really fucking mean of course.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But then there's Kennison talking about </v>

4030
02:50:03.391 --> 02:50:06.300
<v Speaker 6>the starving people in Ethiopia.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's fucking hilarious.</v>

4031
02:50:06.460 --> 02:50:07.293
<v Speaker 6>It's a total punching down bit and it's </v>
<v Speaker 6>one of the greatest bits of all time </v>

4032
02:50:10.170 --> 02:50:11.003
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's funny and you cannot define </v>

4033
02:50:12.570 --> 02:50:15.210
<v Speaker 6>what's funny and what's not funny.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Some people,</v>

4034
02:50:16.040 --> 02:50:20.540
<v Speaker 2>well we have seen some mean common who </v>
<v Speaker 2>bully be able with their comedy.</v>

4035
02:50:20.541 --> 02:50:21.380
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't work though.</v>

4036
02:50:21.480 --> 02:50:21.980
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

4037
02:50:21.980 --> 02:50:23.420
<v Speaker 2>It's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody likes it.</v>

4038
02:50:23.810 --> 02:50:25.010
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen it.</v>

4039
02:50:25.070 --> 02:50:26.630
<v Speaker 2>I've seen it work sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

4040
02:50:27.140 --> 02:50:27.973
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying there's nothing to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying the idea that like some </v>

4041
02:50:31.791 --> 02:50:32.624
<v Speaker 2>things are off limits or what did your </v>
<v Speaker 2>great analogy years and of I'm on base </v>

4042
02:50:36.561 --> 02:50:38.930
<v Speaker 2>and this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't touch this crazy,</v>

4043
02:50:38.931 --> 02:50:40.380
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's nothing off limits but,</v>

4044
02:50:41.180 --> 02:50:43.700
<v Speaker 6>but people will decide that there's </v>
<v Speaker 6>something off limits.</v>

4045
02:50:43.701 --> 02:50:47.450
<v Speaker 6>And then the way they reinforce that </v>
<v Speaker 6>they gang up on people like bullies.</v>

4046
02:50:48.050 --> 02:50:48.883
<v Speaker 6>Like Daniel Tosh got in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Remember when Daniel Tosh made that </v>

4047
02:50:51.771 --> 02:50:53.220
<v Speaker 6>joke,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which was a,</v>

4048
02:50:53.270 --> 02:50:55.130
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're dealing with the handler,</v>

4049
02:50:55.131 --> 02:50:55.964
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's dealing with a heckler and </v>

4050
02:50:56.990 --> 02:50:59.750
<v Speaker 6>[inaudible] he was also not even </v>
<v Speaker 6>supposed to be on stage,</v>

4051
02:50:59.780 --> 02:51:00.613
<v Speaker 6>so he didn't have any material prepared.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And Dom irrera forced him to go on </v>

4052
02:51:03.641 --> 02:51:04.940
<v Speaker 6>stage.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The client go on stage.</v>

4053
02:51:04.941 --> 02:51:05.840
<v Speaker 6>So he,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he said,</v>

4054
02:51:05.841 --> 02:51:06.500
<v Speaker 6>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>

4055
02:51:06.500 --> 02:51:07.333
<v Speaker 6>So we went on stage and he didn't have </v>
<v Speaker 6>any materials cause what do you guys </v>

4056
02:51:08.721 --> 02:51:09.770
<v Speaker 6>want to talk?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't have any material.</v>

4057
02:51:09.771 --> 02:51:12.560
<v Speaker 6>What do you guys want to talk about?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And some guy yells out rape.</v>

4058
02:51:13.430 --> 02:51:14.510
<v Speaker 6>And so he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

4059
02:51:14.840 --> 02:51:16.640
<v Speaker 6>what's funny about rape?</v>
<v Speaker 6>The humiliation,</v>

4060
02:51:16.641 --> 02:51:18.170
<v Speaker 6>the violence.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like what's sorry,</v>

4061
02:51:18.171 --> 02:51:19.130
<v Speaker 6>what's funny about rape,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

4062
02:51:19.250 --> 02:51:22.430
<v Speaker 6>And some woman yells at,</v>
<v Speaker 6>actually nothing's funny about rape.</v>

4063
02:51:22.700 --> 02:51:23.533
<v Speaker 6>This is like someone who took the </v>
<v Speaker 6>opportunity to be sanctimonious and </v>

4064
02:51:27.890 --> 02:51:29.360
<v Speaker 6>obviously nothing's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Rape.</v>

4065
02:51:29.390 --> 02:51:30.223
<v Speaker 6>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well wouldn't it be funny if five guys </v>

4066
02:51:30.891 --> 02:51:34.400
<v Speaker 6>just raped her right now?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Which is something that a comedian would</v>

4067
02:51:34.401 --> 02:51:35.240
<v Speaker 6>say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

4068
02:51:35.270 --> 02:51:39.710
<v Speaker 6>And so this woman goes and writes a blog</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then it becomes this big issue.</v>

4069
02:51:39.711 --> 02:51:42.830
<v Speaker 6>Did he crossed the line?</v>
<v Speaker 6>She's a fucking heckler.</v>

4070
02:51:42.890 --> 02:51:44.990
<v Speaker 6>I know he's a heckler.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not only that,</v>

4071
02:51:44.991 --> 02:51:45.824
<v Speaker 6>she's the worst kind of hackler.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Someone is trying to take the high </v>

4072
02:51:49.221 --> 02:51:50.054
<v Speaker 6>ground and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and be sanctimonious and stand up and </v>

4073
02:51:53.661 --> 02:51:56.510
<v Speaker 6>admonish anyone for saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>

4074
02:51:56.511 --> 02:51:58.400
<v Speaker 6>you'll enjoy the show or don't enjoy the</v>
<v Speaker 6>show.</v>

4075
02:51:58.550 --> 02:52:00.500
<v Speaker 6>Leave,</v>
<v Speaker 6>do whatever the fuck you want.</v>

4076
02:52:00.501 --> 02:52:01.334
<v Speaker 6>But if you want to jump in and decide </v>
<v Speaker 6>that you're going to be the moral voice </v>

4077
02:52:05.500 --> 02:52:07.570
<v Speaker 6>of the crowd,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're going to get chopped up.</v>

4078
02:52:07.780 --> 02:52:09.340
<v Speaker 6>And that's how comedy works.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's your,</v>

4079
02:52:09.341 --> 02:52:10.174
<v Speaker 6>you're dealing with live comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And when someone has to make comedy out </v>

4080
02:52:13.151 --> 02:52:13.984
<v Speaker 6>of what you just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you just come all over these people and </v>

4081
02:52:17.470 --> 02:52:21.910
<v Speaker 6>you used your emotions and you used your</v>
<v Speaker 6>morality and you decided you're going to</v>

4082
02:52:21.911 --> 02:52:24.640
<v Speaker 6>enforce it on these people in the middle</v>
<v Speaker 6>of a comedy show,</v>

4083
02:52:24.940 --> 02:52:27.280
<v Speaker 6>you can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know what he's doing?</v>

4084
02:52:27.370 --> 02:52:29.470
<v Speaker 6>He's trying to make comedy out of </v>
<v Speaker 6>something.</v>

4085
02:52:29.520 --> 02:52:32.460
<v Speaker 2>And also just his reaction to be the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4086
02:52:32.461 --> 02:52:34.200
<v Speaker 2>it was perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just do that kind of like,</v>

4087
02:52:34.201 --> 02:52:36.330
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the worst offensive thing</v>

4088
02:52:36.560 --> 02:52:39.820
<v Speaker 6>say to somebody who just said nothing </v>
<v Speaker 6>about rapes fun.</v>

4089
02:52:39.890 --> 02:52:41.650
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Would it be funny if five guys raped her</v>

4090
02:52:41.651 --> 02:52:42.780
<v Speaker 6>right now and then,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>

4091
02:52:43.010 --> 02:52:44.090
<v Speaker 6>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the audience,</v>

4092
02:52:44.290 --> 02:52:45.610

<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

4093
02:52:45.680 --> 02:52:46.513
<v Speaker 6>Timing was perfect and she's decided </v>
<v Speaker 6>this is a fucking wonderful opportunity </v>

4094
02:52:50.271 --> 02:52:51.950
<v Speaker 6>to be recreationally outraged.</v>

4095
02:52:53.310 --> 02:52:54.143
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

4096
02:52:54.150 --> 02:52:57.570
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate fuck them.</v>

4097
02:52:57.630 --> 02:52:58.830
<v Speaker 2>I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand,</v>

4098
02:52:59.280 --> 02:53:00.670
<v Speaker 2>but I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about,</v>

4099
02:53:00.830 --> 02:53:03.540
<v Speaker 2>let me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me take the side of like,</v>

4100
02:53:04.200 --> 02:53:05.033
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now that I have a twitter account and </v>

4101
02:53:07.760 --> 02:53:09.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm not talking about me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about in our audience member</v>

4102
02:53:09.601 --> 02:53:10.434
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was outraged that somebody made fun </v>

4103
02:53:12.121 --> 02:53:15.360
<v Speaker 2>of something that now comedians can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>hear.</v>

4104
02:53:15.361 --> 02:53:16.194
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't have free speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't yell at me and my friends can </v>

4105
02:53:19.591 --> 02:53:21.930
<v Speaker 2>gang up on a comedian yell at them on </v>
<v Speaker 2>twitter.</v>

4106
02:53:22.320 --> 02:53:23.550
<v Speaker 2>You certainly again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

4107
02:53:25.080 --> 02:53:26.340
<v Speaker 2>but you're a cunt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4108
02:53:26.620 --> 02:53:27.453
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

4109
02:53:28.350 --> 02:53:29.183
<v Speaker 6>Well it depends.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It depends on whether or not you have a </v>

4110
02:53:30.621 --> 02:53:31.454
<v Speaker 6>point,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

4111
02:53:31.670 --> 02:53:34.940
<v Speaker 6>It's like all kinds of opinions and you </v>
<v Speaker 6>can have an argument with someone,</v>

4112
02:53:34.941 --> 02:53:37.410
<v Speaker 6>like say if you have an argument,</v>
<v Speaker 6>someone publicly and somebody stands and</v>

4113
02:53:37.420 --> 02:53:38.253
<v Speaker 6>walks by and they maybe didn't get the </v>
<v Speaker 6>entire full argument but they watch you </v>

4114
02:53:40.761 --> 02:53:41.594
<v Speaker 6>say something mean to that person.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're allowed to have an opinion on </v>

4115
02:53:44.001 --> 02:53:44.834
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It might not be the most informed </v>

4116
02:53:45.801 --> 02:53:47.180
<v Speaker 6>opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it might not be correct.</v>

4117
02:53:47.181 --> 02:53:51.140
<v Speaker 6>And then maybe you can choose to engage </v>
<v Speaker 6>them and have a discussion about their,</v>

4118
02:53:51.200 --> 02:53:53.410
<v Speaker 6>their opinion or you can choose to not </v>
<v Speaker 6>and let it,</v>

4119
02:53:53.450 --> 02:53:57.140
<v Speaker 6>let it exist in a vacuum and let them </v>
<v Speaker 6>just fucking Yap about it.</v>

4120
02:53:57.140 --> 02:53:58.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me ask you another question.</v>

4121
02:53:58.370 --> 02:53:59.203
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I know you don't like it ha like me </v>

4122
02:54:00.771 --> 02:54:03.290
<v Speaker 2>asking about asking questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4123
02:54:04.100 --> 02:54:06.290
<v Speaker 2>That's not the question though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4124
02:54:06.980 --> 02:54:07.813
<v Speaker 2>That's not the question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there anything you've done in your </v>

4125
02:54:11.511 --> 02:54:15.590
<v Speaker 2>act through the years and you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>released many albums,</v>

4126
02:54:15.630 --> 02:54:17.330
<v Speaker 2>had five specials,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4127
02:54:17.870 --> 02:54:18.590
<v Speaker 2>At least.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4128
02:54:18.590 --> 02:54:21.560
<v Speaker 2>At least candy we count.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

4129
02:54:22.190 --> 02:54:24.410
<v Speaker 2>is there anything you've looked back and</v>
<v Speaker 2>gone?</v>

4130
02:54:24.810 --> 02:54:27.920
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I would have worded that </v>
<v Speaker 2>today the way I did back then.</v>

4131
02:54:29.100 --> 02:54:29.933
<v Speaker 6>Not In terms of it being offensive,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but in terms of it being solid man on </v>

4132
02:54:33.750 --> 02:54:34.583
<v Speaker 6>the economy of words was incorrect or it</v>
<v Speaker 6>wasn't the best bit or I should have </v>

4133
02:54:38.701 --> 02:54:43.270
<v Speaker 6>worked on it more before I did it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Or maybe I got a little lazy and my,</v>

4134
02:54:43.430 --> 02:54:45.510
<v Speaker 6>which is more about tightening,</v>
<v Speaker 6>making a bit better.</v>

4135
02:54:45.511 --> 02:54:49.800
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But that's just like looking at it now,</v>

4136
02:54:49.860 --> 02:54:53.370
<v Speaker 6>standing back and being completely done </v>
<v Speaker 6>with the material and then going over it</v>

4137
02:54:53.371 --> 02:54:55.800
<v Speaker 6>now and then being able to critique it </v>
<v Speaker 6>honestly and openly.</v>

4138
02:54:56.370 --> 02:54:58.890
<v Speaker 6>But at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no is my points.</v>

4139
02:54:59.650 --> 02:55:01.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying looking back,</v>

4140
02:55:01.750 --> 02:55:02.950
<v Speaker 2>would you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

4141
02:55:03.080 --> 02:55:04.250
<v Speaker 2>I wish I hadn't said</v>

4142
02:55:06.610 --> 02:55:07.490
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not really.</v>

4143
02:55:07.580 --> 02:55:08.360
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's,</v>

4144
02:55:08.360 --> 02:55:09.590
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

4145
02:55:09.591 --> 02:55:12.710
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think pretty much everything </v>
<v Speaker 3>I've ever said I've thought about before</v>

4146
02:55:12.711 --> 02:55:13.544
<v Speaker 3>I said it enough to point where I had to</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a reason for wanting to joke about </v>

4147
02:55:16.671 --> 02:55:19.130
<v Speaker 3>it and then I had to have a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a perspective,</v>

4148
02:55:20.180 --> 02:55:23.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm betting matches more as a evolution </v>
<v Speaker 2>is someone who's always,</v>

4149
02:55:24.110 --> 02:55:25.700
<v Speaker 2>as you said earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>learning,</v>

4150
02:55:25.820 --> 02:55:26.720
<v Speaker 2>trying new things.</v>

4151
02:55:26.940 --> 02:55:28.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean here was,</v>

4152
02:55:28.440 --> 02:55:31.260
<v Speaker 3>have an evolution of my own thought </v>
<v Speaker 3>process.</v>

4153
02:55:31.380 --> 02:55:33.930
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think when I look at old comedy,</v>

4154
02:55:33.931 --> 02:55:37.650
<v Speaker 3>what gets me is how it links to what </v>
<v Speaker 3>words.</v>

4155
02:55:37.710 --> 02:55:39.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>An extra words.</v>

4156
02:55:40.290 --> 02:55:43.770
<v Speaker 3>Economy of words.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So critical and also,</v>

4157
02:55:43.800 --> 02:55:44.633
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the being in the moment and the timing </v>

4158
02:55:46.621 --> 02:55:47.700
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and just,</v>

4159
02:55:47.970 --> 02:55:50.220
<v Speaker 3>it's why it's hard to watch yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard,</v>

4160
02:55:50.520 --> 02:55:54.090
<v Speaker 3>but it's critical because that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that watching and listening to yourself,</v>

4161
02:55:54.091 --> 02:55:56.130
<v Speaker 3>do you tape yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Reset every set.</v>

4162
02:55:56.460 --> 02:55:57.330
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4163
02:55:57.840 --> 02:55:59.690
<v Speaker 3>That is discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Got It.</v>

4164
02:55:59.730 --> 02:56:00.750
<v Speaker 3>That is hot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4165
02:56:00.751 --> 02:56:01.584
<v Speaker 3>That the only way you're ever going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand where you ad libbed and </v>

4166
02:56:04.471 --> 02:56:06.930
<v Speaker 3>figuring out what those have lives are </v>
<v Speaker 3>and whether or not they're valid.</v>

4167
02:56:07.170 --> 02:56:08.520
<v Speaker 3>When do you listen to it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>On the car?</v>

4168
02:56:08.521 --> 02:56:09.420
<v Speaker 3>On the way home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4169
02:56:09.690 --> 02:56:13.560
<v Speaker 3>That's the best way.</v>
