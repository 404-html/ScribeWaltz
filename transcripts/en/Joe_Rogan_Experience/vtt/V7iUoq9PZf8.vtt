1
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:02.850
<v Speaker 1>Five four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.230
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

3
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:06.310
<v Speaker 1>Mike Baker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ladies,</v>

4
00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:07.620
<v Speaker 1>gentlemen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're live,</v>

5
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.450
<v Speaker 1>ladies and gentlemen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going on buddy?</v>

6
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the usual some wolves over here.</v>

7
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:13.650
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

8
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:14.670
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

9
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.270
<v Speaker 1>I left the state of Idaho because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we're overrun with wolves,</v>

10
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.310
<v Speaker 1>wolves and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

11
00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:20.071
<v Speaker 1>and that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

12
00:00:20.071 --> 00:00:20.904
<v Speaker 1>that's all we got was just listening to </v>
<v Speaker 1>a podcast where these guys were talking </v>

13
00:00:23.611 --> 00:00:24.444
<v Speaker 1>about wolves and about how they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>hiking and they found four dead mature </v>

14
00:00:29.581 --> 00:00:30.414
<v Speaker 1>bull elk inside of like a couple miles </v>
<v Speaker 1>stretch that had been torn apart by </v>

15
00:00:35.791 --> 00:00:37.170
<v Speaker 1>wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they started to freak out.</v>

16
00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:40.243
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

17
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.610
<v Speaker 1>at two things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got this time of year,</v>

18
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.800
<v Speaker 1>we've got a lot of wolves and we've got </v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of rattlesnakes.</v>

19
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.560
<v Speaker 1>Rattlesnakes are starting to pop up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>make their appearance warm.</v>

20
00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:47.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

21
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.440
<v Speaker 1>And there are some seasons where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't swing a dead cat without hitting a</v>

22
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.390
<v Speaker 1>rattlesnake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course if you swing a dead cat,</v>

23
00:00:54.391 --> 00:00:55.224
<v Speaker 1>a wolf will show up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's not a good idea in case </v>

24
00:00:57.241 --> 00:00:59.220
<v Speaker 1>anybody's wondering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never been,</v>

25
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.083
<v Speaker 1>I'm going June 30th to boise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just announced it tickets today and </v>

26
00:01:03.301 --> 00:01:05.220
<v Speaker 1>it's fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm excited to be there.</v>

27
00:01:05.221 --> 00:01:07.650
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I keep hearing about wolves.</v>

28
00:01:07.651 --> 00:01:09.530
<v Speaker 1>Is that a real issue up there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it not?</v>

29
00:01:09.531 --> 00:01:11.670
<v Speaker 1>It's not exaggerating the century link </v>
<v Speaker 1>arena.</v>

30
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.370
<v Speaker 1>It won't be a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you should be safe from that.</v>

31
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.990
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

32
00:01:15.991 --> 00:01:17.720
<v Speaker 1>bring your gear and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

33
00:01:17.721 --> 00:01:20.100
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Idaho is an interesting place because,</v>

34
00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a part time legislature,</v>

35
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.440
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

36
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.273
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the way I think all states </v>

37
00:01:23.821 --> 00:01:27.480
<v Speaker 1>should operate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means everybody goes home to their</v>

38
00:01:27.481 --> 00:01:28.410
<v Speaker 1>jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

39
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.360
<v Speaker 1>if you just look at the top of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>state,</v>

40
00:01:30.361 --> 00:01:32.220
<v Speaker 1>the governor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Butch Otter,</v>

41
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.380
<v Speaker 1>great guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brad little lieutenant governor,</v>

42
00:01:34.381 --> 00:01:35.850
<v Speaker 1>terrific guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're both ranchers,</v>

43
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.350
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So full time,</v>

44
00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:38.190
<v Speaker 1>full time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

45
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:39.060
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically.</v>

46
00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.590
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

47
00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:41.483
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they look at it from a different </v>

48
00:01:42.961 --> 00:01:44.560
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A perspective,</v>

49
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:45.170
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

50
00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here in California,</v>

51
00:01:46.291 --> 00:01:47.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you say you got a wolf problem,</v>

52
00:01:47.641 --> 00:01:48.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that racist,</v>

53
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.673
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one perspective and one issue and then </v>

54
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:51.300
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

55
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.133
<v Speaker 1>we have a people problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we have a piece that the wolves are </v>

56
00:01:53.761 --> 00:01:54.594
<v Speaker 1>amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those wolves are so special and in a </v>

57
00:01:59.731 --> 00:02:00.564
<v Speaker 1>place like Idaho or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get a place like Montana or </v>

58
00:02:02.731 --> 00:02:05.910
<v Speaker 1>somewhere else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose they look at it differently,</v>

59
00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:06.380
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

60
00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.180
<v Speaker 1>it's a working issue that you got it.</v>

61
00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.013
<v Speaker 1>You got to sort out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly if you're a rancher or </v>

62
00:02:09.961 --> 00:02:10.270
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

63
00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:11.280
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're living off the land,</v>

64
00:02:11.281 --> 00:02:12.114
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

65
00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.270
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

66
00:02:13.271 --> 00:02:14.104
<v Speaker 1>I tell you what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boise is going to go crazy when they </v>

67
00:02:15.121 --> 00:02:16.760
<v Speaker 1>find out that he's coming up because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>get,</v>

68
00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.230
<v Speaker 1>it's a huge fan base.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They love you up there.</v>

69
00:02:19.231 --> 00:02:21.120
<v Speaker 1>It's all people stop me and want to talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

70
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.910
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I keep thinking,</v>

71
00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:22.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some said,</v>

72
00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry for interrupting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>

73
00:02:23.581 --> 00:02:25.530
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can ask maybe something about North</v>

74
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.330
<v Speaker 1>Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about Iran or some bigger,</v>

75
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.380
<v Speaker 1>it's not that you're not a big issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then they'll say,</v>

76
00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.590
<v Speaker 1>what's Joe like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And well that's kind of what I say.</v>

77
00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.470
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what about Iran,</v>

78
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.380
<v Speaker 1>North Korea,</v>

80
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:42.383

114
00:03:51.071 --> 00:03:53.350
<v Speaker 2>roller blades out and you can go do laps</v>

<v Speaker 2>over the past 24 hours because of Iran.</v>

120
00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.330
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what you're hearing as you're hearing</v>

121
00:04:07.331 --> 00:04:08.950
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

122
00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.640
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

123
00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:10.473
<v Speaker 2>the critics of the current president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and apparently there are some that are </v>

124
00:04:14.531 --> 00:04:14.981
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

125
00:04:14.981 --> 00:04:15.491
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

126
00:04:15.491 --> 00:04:18.220
<v Speaker 2>he's in Chicos closer to a military </v>
<v Speaker 2>conflict with Iran.</v>

127
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.233
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are the same brainiacs that said </v>

128
00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.050
<v Speaker 2>he was entering gets closer to war with </v>
<v Speaker 2>North Korea and they,</v>

129
00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:24.430
<v Speaker 2>everybody was completely wrong on that.</v>

130
00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:25.713
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that behind me and the </v>

131
00:04:26.741 --> 00:04:28.900
<v Speaker 2>others in the Iranian regime might not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

132
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.240
<v Speaker 2>decide to become more bellicose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

133
00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.190
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're,</v>

134
00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.830
<v Speaker 2>I think they're looking at it wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's this idea that,</v>

135
00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:37.870
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's a couple of parts,</v>

136
00:04:37.871 --> 00:04:39.160
<v Speaker 2>part one is that they're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

137
00:04:39.161 --> 00:04:39.910
<v Speaker 2>look at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

138
00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:40.743
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't have a plan b implying that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's either this deal which even our </v>

139
00:04:43.721 --> 00:04:45.700
<v Speaker 2>European allies say is inadequate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

140
00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.340
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or it's a military conflict.</v>

141
00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.580
<v Speaker 2>And that's kind of what the previous </v>
<v Speaker 2>president was,</v>

142
00:04:50.581 --> 00:04:51.414
<v Speaker 2>was all about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We either get this deal or we're having </v>

143
00:04:52.601 --> 00:04:54.170
<v Speaker 2>a military conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

144
00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.490
<v Speaker 2>there's other things in the works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's other options in that,</v>

145
00:04:57.491 --> 00:04:59.500
<v Speaker 2>in that decision tree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

146
00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.890
<v Speaker 2>and so I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a false premise.</v>

147
00:05:02.891 --> 00:05:05.830
<v Speaker 2>And the other thing when they talk about</v>
<v Speaker 2>it over the past 24 hours anyways,</v>

148
00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:07.390
<v Speaker 2>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well look at this.</v>

149
00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:08.790
<v Speaker 2>This is going to make it harder to get a</v>
<v Speaker 2>deal with,</v>

150
00:05:08.791 --> 00:05:09.624
<v Speaker 2>with Kim Jong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None from North Korea is cause he's </v>

151
00:05:11.171 --> 00:05:13.870
<v Speaker 2>going to think that we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't support our deals.</v>

152
00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.210
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I look at a different way.</v>

153
00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.400
<v Speaker 2>I think that Kim Jong Un is going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>look at this and think,</v>

154
00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:19.840
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

155
00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:21.670
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to put up with an </v>
<v Speaker 2>inadequate deal.</v>

156
00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:23.350
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's gonna look at it and say,</v>

157
00:05:23.351 --> 00:05:24.184
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

158
00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.130
<v Speaker 2>because nobody disagrees with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Iranian deal.</v>

159
00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.350
<v Speaker 2>They want to talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to talk about how it looked.</v>

160
00:05:30.351 --> 00:05:32.350
<v Speaker 2>The Iranians are complying with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

161
00:05:32.351 --> 00:05:36.190
<v Speaker 2>the Iranians are complying with what </v>
<v Speaker 2>they agreed to allow him the deal.</v>

162
00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:39.460
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is none of their military sites,</v>

163
00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:40.923
<v Speaker 2>the number of times inspectors have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have actually gotten on and inspected a </v>

164
00:05:43.691 --> 00:05:45.490
<v Speaker 2>military site,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including Parchin,</v>

165
00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:46.383
<v Speaker 2>the most important military facility in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Iran since that deal was signed in 2015 </v>

166
00:05:50.681 --> 00:05:51.514
<v Speaker 2>was zero.</v>

167
00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:56.800
<v Speaker 2>Haven't been there because the Iranians </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't agree to allow any of those sites</v>

168
00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.150
<v Speaker 2>in this deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's like,</v>

169
00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:00.013
<v Speaker 2>that's like saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like saying if you're a serial </v>

170
00:06:02.241 --> 00:06:03.074
<v Speaker 2>killer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll allow the police to come in and </v>

171
00:06:04.131 --> 00:06:06.080
<v Speaker 2>search your home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can't go in the basement.</v>

172
00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.270
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not that also he called us,</v>

173
00:06:08.271 --> 00:06:09.860
<v Speaker 2>put their bodies in the basement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

174
00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:11.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suspect that's the case.</v>

175
00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:12.913
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

176
00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:15.710
<v Speaker 2>it's an interesting thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess I wanted to throw that out there</v>

177
00:06:15.711 --> 00:06:16.544
<v Speaker 2>right off the bat because I think Iran </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now is consuming so much of the </v>

178
00:06:19.041 --> 00:06:20.720
<v Speaker 2>oxygen for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for people out there.</v>

179
00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:24.200
<v Speaker 2>So people thinking that the reason why </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're backing out of the deals,</v>

180
00:06:24.201 --> 00:06:26.180
<v Speaker 2>because the presence being unreasonable </v>
<v Speaker 2>home,</v>

181
00:06:26.181 --> 00:06:29.180
<v Speaker 2>we're forcing what you're just saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a shit deal.</v>

182
00:06:29.181 --> 00:06:30.440
<v Speaker 2>Period.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

183
00:06:30.441 --> 00:06:31.274
<v Speaker 2>I think the idea that we have to stay in</v>
<v Speaker 2>it because it's better than the </v>

184
00:06:34.581 --> 00:06:36.240
<v Speaker 2>alternative and the alternative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

185
00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:41.000
<v Speaker 2>being a war is not framing it properly.</v>

186
00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:44.000
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't make any sense to me.</v>

187
00:06:44.001 --> 00:06:46.330
<v Speaker 2>But I think that the fact that the UK,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

188
00:06:46.331 --> 00:06:46.721
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

189
00:06:46.721 --> 00:06:47.554
<v Speaker 2>the French,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Germans have all agreed publicly </v>

190
00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.700
<v Speaker 2>that it's an inadequate deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It needs to be fixed.</v>

191
00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:53.863
<v Speaker 2>That tells you something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it also tells you that they have </v>

192
00:06:55.521 --> 00:06:59.390
<v Speaker 2>real strong financial incentives for </v>
<v Speaker 2>continuing to do business in Iran.</v>

193
00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.640
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and as to Russia and China,</v>

194
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:05.210
<v Speaker 2>frankly the other signatories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

195
00:07:05.211 --> 00:07:06.044
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and also here's the other part would be </v>

196
00:07:07.021 --> 00:07:08.300
<v Speaker 2>trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

197
00:07:08.301 --> 00:07:09.134
<v Speaker 2>what does it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now we're 16 or 17 months into trump's </v>

198
00:07:10.491 --> 00:07:12.250
<v Speaker 2>administration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not like he,</v>

199
00:07:12.251 --> 00:07:14.210
<v Speaker 2>he got into the White House and the next</v>
<v Speaker 2>day he,</v>

200
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:15.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he can the deal,</v>

201
00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:18.200
<v Speaker 2>he's been talking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but nobody listens to anything.</v>

202
00:07:18.201 --> 00:07:19.034
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a supporter of trump </v>

203
00:07:19.671 --> 00:07:20.391
<v Speaker 2>necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

204
00:07:20.391 --> 00:07:23.000
<v Speaker 2>I want the government to work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not that I'm supporting trump.</v>

205
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:23.833
<v Speaker 2>I support that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want the government to work just like </v>

206
00:07:24.861 --> 00:07:27.020
<v Speaker 2>the previous administration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't as supportive Obama,</v>

207
00:07:27.021 --> 00:07:28.160
<v Speaker 2>but hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want it to work.</v>

208
00:07:28.161 --> 00:07:31.400
<v Speaker 2>I like things to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he,</v>

209
00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:32.293
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he went out there and there was some </v>

210
00:07:33.081 --> 00:07:33.681
<v Speaker 2>talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

211
00:07:33.681 --> 00:07:37.010
<v Speaker 2>let's see if we can't find some way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get rid of the sunset clause,</v>

212
00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:41.180
<v Speaker 2>some way to rein in their ballistic </v>
<v Speaker 2>missile development program.</v>

213
00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:42.950
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some way,</v>

214
00:07:42.951 --> 00:07:45.170
<v Speaker 2>although it's not going to happen to </v>
<v Speaker 2>reign in all the,</v>

215
00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:46.483
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

216
00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:47.091
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

217
00:07:47.091 --> 00:07:47.661
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

218
00:07:47.661 --> 00:07:49.280
<v Speaker 2>the shenanigans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to call it that,</v>

219
00:07:49.281 --> 00:07:50.840
<v Speaker 2>the Dura engaged in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the Middle East.</v>

220
00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:54.030
<v Speaker 2>And that didn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think he,</v>

221
00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:54.940
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

222
00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:59.980
<v Speaker 2>took a step that is not as God awful as </v>
<v Speaker 2>his critics would like us to believe.</v>

223
00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:03.920
<v Speaker 2>Well that isn't that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a real problem.</v>

224
00:08:03.921 --> 00:08:05.180
<v Speaker 2>And your phone's going off over there.</v>

225
00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:07.130
<v Speaker 2>A little fella.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

226
00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:10.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to check your watch too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a world we're living in.</v>

227
00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:12.800
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is good.</v>

228
00:08:12.801 --> 00:08:14.600
<v Speaker 2>Your phone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to check your watch.</v>

229
00:08:14.601 --> 00:08:16.190
<v Speaker 2>My wife got me this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

230
00:08:16.191 --> 00:08:18.820
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this apple now float.</v>

231
00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:20.090
<v Speaker 2>Now we'll get to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does.</v>

232
00:08:20.091 --> 00:08:20.924
<v Speaker 2>It's waterproof,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think took to a certain period of </v>

233
00:08:22.221 --> 00:08:23.080
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

234
00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:24.131
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

235
00:08:24.131 --> 00:08:25.790
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does all sorts of things.</v>

236
00:08:25.791 --> 00:08:26.624
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a clue what it does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She got it for me so I could check my </v>

237
00:08:28.851 --> 00:08:31.040
<v Speaker 2>heart rate and just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

238
00:08:31.041 --> 00:08:31.910
<v Speaker 2>for health reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

239
00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:32.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm,</v>

240
00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:34.460
<v Speaker 2>if I'm out running and working out and </v>
<v Speaker 2>she said,</v>

241
00:08:34.461 --> 00:08:35.600
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should have something like that.</v>

242
00:08:35.601 --> 00:08:37.980
<v Speaker 2>Cause I refused to wear a fitbit or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever they call it.</v>

243
00:08:38.410 --> 00:08:40.940
<v Speaker 2>What's the difference between a fitbit </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that will this eye,</v>

244
00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:42.140
<v Speaker 2>it's like Dick Tracy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could,</v>

245
00:08:42.141 --> 00:08:44.210
<v Speaker 2>if I knew how to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could talk on my phone.</v>

246
00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:46.520
<v Speaker 2>I could answer it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It rings.</v>

247
00:08:46.521 --> 00:08:49.160
<v Speaker 2>I have no clue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can't be too hard.</v>

248
00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:51.140
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's that hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm just trying it on air.</v>

249
00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:52.003
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

250
00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:54.860
<v Speaker 2>Somebody called me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody give me a shout.</v>

251
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:57.030
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems like a great thing.</v>

252
00:08:57.690 --> 00:08:59.610
<v Speaker 2>But honest to God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only thing I've used it so far is to</v>

253
00:08:59.611 --> 00:09:00.444
<v Speaker 2>glance at the time and then to check my </v>
<v Speaker 2>heart rate all the other crap on there </v>

254
00:09:02.881 --> 00:09:04.560
<v Speaker 2>and everything happens on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

255
00:09:04.561 --> 00:09:07.860
<v Speaker 2>So if I'm using my phone for directions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get directions on my watch.</v>

256
00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.950
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a little bit overwhelming so</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go back to a normal watch I</v>

257
00:09:10.951 --> 00:09:11.784
<v Speaker 2>think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

258
00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:14.290
<v Speaker 2>and if my heart gives out it gives out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

259
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:17.670
<v Speaker 2>I got this g shock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does all kinds of shit.</v>

260
00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:22.080
<v Speaker 2>Never used it once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used the time part,</v>

261
00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:27.260
<v Speaker 2>the altimeter and it works as a compass </v>
<v Speaker 2>and all kinds of shit.</v>

262
00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:30.190
<v Speaker 2>I've never compas is good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this is good.</v>

263
00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:31.470
<v Speaker 2>We used to have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we spent,</v>

264
00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:33.430
<v Speaker 2>we spent a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if this is,</v>

265
00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:36.690
<v Speaker 2>this is how old I'm getting I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not early training.</v>

266
00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:38.313
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we spent a long time working maps and </v>

267
00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:40.803
<v Speaker 2>compass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

268
00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:41.793
<v Speaker 2>Shooting Asthma's and figuring out where</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're at and trying to and shoot an </v>

269
00:09:44.411 --> 00:09:45.240
<v Speaker 2>asthma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

270
00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:45.790
<v Speaker 2>You know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

271
00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:47.940
<v Speaker 2>I'll figure figuring out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're basically,</v>

272
00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:49.043
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to oversimplify this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're basically triangulating and </v>

273
00:09:51.811 --> 00:09:53.970
<v Speaker 2>figuring out where you are at any given </v>
<v Speaker 2>point in time.</v>

274
00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:55.830
<v Speaker 2>What do you call it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>asthma with eh?</v>

275
00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:58.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is a very good question.</v>

276
00:09:58.171 --> 00:09:59.660
<v Speaker 2>And not one that I asked when I was in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

277
00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:00.663
<v Speaker 2>in the outfit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was one of those people that would </v>

278
00:10:03.021 --> 00:10:04.560
<v Speaker 2>just accept things as they were told to </v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

279
00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:07.260
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why I got along so well.</v>

280
00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:10.260
<v Speaker 2>I never questioned anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is an interesting point.</v>

281
00:10:10.261 --> 00:10:11.094
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to roam all over this </v>

282
00:10:11.911 --> 00:10:12.744
<v Speaker 2>place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but today was a confirmation hearings </v>

283
00:10:16.681 --> 00:10:19.060
<v Speaker 2>for Gina Hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

284
00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:21.780
<v Speaker 2>I'll caveat this by saying I'm a big </v>
<v Speaker 2>supporter of hers.</v>

285
00:10:21.781 --> 00:10:23.480
<v Speaker 2>I think she's an outstanding choice for </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

286
00:10:23.481 --> 00:10:28.020
<v Speaker 2>She's the new head of the CIA,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the new director designate for the CIA.</v>

287
00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:30.150
<v Speaker 2>And so today she went up on Capitol </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hill.</v>

288
00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:31.310
<v Speaker 2>I had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

289
00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:32.223
<v Speaker 2>open and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then subsequently closed door session </v>

290
00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:39.810
<v Speaker 2>with the senators and some of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>senators.</v>

291
00:10:39.811 --> 00:10:40.644
<v Speaker 2>The reason I bring this up is because a </v>
<v Speaker 2>handful of the senators were asking her </v>

292
00:10:44.161 --> 00:10:46.290
<v Speaker 2>and seem to focused on saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

293
00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:47.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>

294
00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:48.693
<v Speaker 2>when would this rendition program,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they rendition and interrogation </v>

295
00:10:50.371 --> 00:10:53.400
<v Speaker 2>program,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how did you feel about it?</v>

296
00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:56.120
<v Speaker 2>What morally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

297
00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:57.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you have any quandary is what we,</v>

298
00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:58.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know that you,</v>

299
00:10:58.801 --> 00:10:59.301
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

300
00:10:59.301 --> 00:10:59.791
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

301
00:10:59.791 --> 00:11:02.310
<v Speaker 2>the agency was doing what was allowed </v>
<v Speaker 2>within the Department of Justice.</v>

302
00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:03.313
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the office of legal counsel was </v>

303
00:11:04.291 --> 00:11:07.920
<v Speaker 2>directing that from the Department of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Justice for that program all those years</v>

304
00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:10.500
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And lots of subsequently changed.</v>

305
00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:11.633
<v Speaker 2>But at the time they didn't want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessarily talk about that cause I </v>

306
00:11:14.041 --> 00:11:14.874
<v Speaker 2>don't think they wanted to highlight the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fact that the doj had said this is what </v>

307
00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:20.300
<v Speaker 2>is able to be done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

308
00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:23.460
<v Speaker 2>so instead they focused on how did you </v>
<v Speaker 2>feel?</v>

309
00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:26.970
<v Speaker 2>And I guess the reason I bring it up is </v>
<v Speaker 2>because when I was in the outfit,</v>

310
00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:29.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a deep thinker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

311
00:11:29.161 --> 00:11:30.990
<v Speaker 2>So I never sort of around and thought to</v>
<v Speaker 2>myself,</v>

312
00:11:30.991 --> 00:11:32.910
<v Speaker 2>how do I feel about this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to give it a moment,</v>

313
00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:33.410
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

314
00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:36.330
<v Speaker 2>no matter what we were doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it never occurred to me to sit there and</v>

315
00:11:36.331 --> 00:11:37.530
<v Speaker 2>question it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

316
00:11:37.531 --> 00:11:38.364
<v Speaker 2>as long as we knew what we were doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>was proper and legal and was pursued of </v>

317
00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:42.420
<v Speaker 2>tasking from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>

318
00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:43.410
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

319
00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.900
<v Speaker 2>national security concerns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then yeah.</v>

320
00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:49.530
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think you want you your </v>
<v Speaker 2>military or your Intel service.</v>

321
00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:52.170
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you want everybody out </v>
<v Speaker 2>there at the pointy edge of the spear,</v>

322
00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:52.891
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>

323
00:11:52.891 --> 00:11:53.724
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do things based on how I </v>

324
00:11:54.371 --> 00:11:55.204
<v Speaker 2>feel about it in the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it just seemed like a strange line </v>

325
00:11:57.941 --> 00:12:02.290
<v Speaker 2>of questioning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>questioning who is responsible for that?</v>

326
00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:03.670
<v Speaker 2>Let me think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were actually,</v>

327
00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:04.210
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were,</v>

328
00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:05.590
<v Speaker 2>there were three or four.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

329
00:12:05.591 --> 00:12:06.910
<v Speaker 2>Senator Reed and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

330
00:12:06.911 --> 00:12:07.744
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so trial Democrats obviously trying to </v>

331
00:12:11.321 --> 00:12:15.040
<v Speaker 2>understand well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what they did then was different than</v>

332
00:12:15.041 --> 00:12:16.810
<v Speaker 2>what is legal today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that the case?</v>

333
00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:17.950
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

334
00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:19.240
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the DOJ,</v>

335
00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:20.490
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

336
00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:22.270
<v Speaker 2>in the wake of nine 11,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

337
00:12:22.271 --> 00:12:23.260
<v Speaker 2>there's so much here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

338
00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:26.200
<v Speaker 2>in the wake of nine 11,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think about the context.</v>

339
00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:27.340
<v Speaker 2>Most people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

340
00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:29.350
<v Speaker 2>young people don't even know what it </v>
<v Speaker 2>feels like.</v>

341
00:12:29.351 --> 00:12:29.830
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

342
00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:30.663
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and other people have forgotten or they </v>

343
00:12:32.351 --> 00:12:34.380
<v Speaker 2>just tired of it all and they don't want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to think about it.</v>

344
00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:36.880
<v Speaker 2>But in the wake of nine 11,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a,</v>

345
00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:39.970
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a feeling there was a sense,</v>

346
00:12:39.971 --> 00:12:41.860
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it was going to happen again.</v>

347
00:12:41.861 --> 00:12:43.870
<v Speaker 2>And there certainly was evidence and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there was,</v>

348
00:12:43.871 --> 00:12:44.704
<v Speaker 2>there was a very large effort here to </v>
<v Speaker 2>try to ensure that we protect American </v>

349
00:12:48.611 --> 00:12:49.444
<v Speaker 2>lives.</v>

350
00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:52.293
<v Speaker 2>So the DOJ was issuing a very clear </v>
<v Speaker 2>guidance on what could and could not be </v>

351
00:12:56.351 --> 00:12:59.560
<v Speaker 2>done for the rendition and interrogation</v>
<v Speaker 2>program.</v>

352
00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:00.663
<v Speaker 2>And that guidance was provided to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>general counsel at the agency that was </v>

353
00:13:03.881 --> 00:13:07.090
<v Speaker 2>then disseminated to personnel out in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the field and tell,</v>

354
00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:07.943
<v Speaker 2>tell people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if they're just listening to us for </v>

355
00:13:09.041 --> 00:13:11.050
<v Speaker 2>the first time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you used to do for the CIA,</v>

356
00:13:11.051 --> 00:13:13.430
<v Speaker 2>so they understand that you're coming </v>
<v Speaker 2>from a position of you,</v>

357
00:13:13.431 --> 00:13:15.210
<v Speaker 2>you actually understand this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

358
00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:15.591
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

359
00:13:15.591 --> 00:13:16.424
<v Speaker 2>I was in the Operations Directorate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the agency is made up of essentially </v>

360
00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:22.270
<v Speaker 2>they'd change the name sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but four directorates.</v>

361
00:13:22.271 --> 00:13:23.830
<v Speaker 2>So you have operations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have intelligence,</v>

362
00:13:23.831 --> 00:13:26.110
<v Speaker 2>which is all the smart people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>reports,</v>

363
00:13:26.111 --> 00:13:27.940
<v Speaker 2>or officers or sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the analysts,</v>

364
00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:29.523
<v Speaker 2>you have science and technology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is where they develop all the </v>

365
00:13:30.821 --> 00:13:33.100
<v Speaker 2>amazing gear that comes out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>agency,</v>

366
00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:35.470
<v Speaker 2>a lot of which then ends up in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>commercial sector.</v>

367
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.930
<v Speaker 2>So if anybody's walking around with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>defibrillator,</v>

368
00:13:37.931 --> 00:13:41.200
<v Speaker 2>that battery technology came out of s </v>
<v Speaker 2>and t research,</v>

369
00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:43.630
<v Speaker 2>drones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>satellite technology,</v>

370
00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:44.830
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

371
00:13:44.831 --> 00:13:46.500
<v Speaker 2>youtube stealth program,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Youtube,</v>

372
00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:47.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>plain was,</v>

373
00:13:47.561 --> 00:13:49.900
<v Speaker 2>was developed out of and run out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>agency.</v>

374
00:13:49.901 --> 00:13:51.610
<v Speaker 2>So incredible things to come out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

375
00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:52.743
<v Speaker 2>And then admin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I was in the Operations Directorate </v>

376
00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:56.313
<v Speaker 2>and worked on everything from counter </v>
<v Speaker 2>narcotics operations to </v>

377
00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:02.670
<v Speaker 2>counterinsurgency operations and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

378
00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:04.780
<v Speaker 2>and then obviously counter terrorism </v>
<v Speaker 2>operations.</v>

379
00:14:04.781 --> 00:14:09.781
<v Speaker 2>So I guess the point is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's,</v>

380
00:14:09.851 --> 00:14:10.684
<v Speaker 2>there's something here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

381
00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:11.643
<v Speaker 2>I'm not quite sure how to explain it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's an interesting point that I </v>

382
00:14:14.261 --> 00:14:15.094
<v Speaker 2>think I've been pondering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is that listening to the hearing </v>

383
00:14:18.101 --> 00:14:20.920
<v Speaker 2>today and listening to the way that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>senators,</v>

384
00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:24.940
<v Speaker 2>the Democratic senators who were looking</v>
<v Speaker 2>to kind of make this the key issue,</v>

385
00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:27.760
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

386
00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:28.653
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a sense of we're not putting it in </v>

387
00:14:30.491 --> 00:14:33.640
<v Speaker 2>context of the time and the national </v>
<v Speaker 2>mood.</v>

388
00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:38.380
<v Speaker 2>And that's a dangerous thing because the</v>
<v Speaker 2>laws were different than they are now.</v>

389
00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:39.243
<v Speaker 2>And they were different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what that means is that because of </v>

390
00:14:41.371 --> 00:14:46.060
<v Speaker 2>in the wake of nine 11,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't want to say that that values</v>

391
00:14:46.061 --> 00:14:47.350
<v Speaker 2>change,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

392
00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:51.440
<v Speaker 2>but I think that they do in the sense of</v>
<v Speaker 2>what people are willing to,</v>

393
00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:52.580
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do.</v>

394
00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:54.200
<v Speaker 2>And whether you're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

395
00:14:54.201 --> 00:14:55.034
<v Speaker 2>we're willing to have a rendition </v>
<v Speaker 2>interrogation program in the wake of </v>

396
00:14:56.931 --> 00:14:58.370
<v Speaker 2>nine 11.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we're not,</v>

397
00:14:58.371 --> 00:15:01.010
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

398
00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.220
<v Speaker 2>so I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyway,</v>

399
00:15:04.221 --> 00:15:05.054
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a danger to that line of </v>

400
00:15:06.981 --> 00:15:08.570
<v Speaker 2>questioning where they kept talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about how,</v>

401
00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:10.520
<v Speaker 2>how did it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how did you feel about it?</v>

402
00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:11.491
<v Speaker 2>And it's not you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

403
00:15:11.491 --> 00:15:11.931
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

404
00:15:11.931 --> 00:15:14.960
<v Speaker 2>you're there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're mixing this and I'm not eloquent</v>

405
00:15:14.961 --> 00:15:17.780
<v Speaker 2>enough to explain it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I found it fascinating that that was</v>

406
00:15:17.781 --> 00:15:19.370
<v Speaker 2>a question they wanted to focus on.</v>

407
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:20.263
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a real danger to people </v>
<v Speaker 2>or for people that don't have any </v>

408
00:15:26.661 --> 00:15:27.494
<v Speaker 2>experience in the actual war and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or really understand combat or really </v>

409
00:15:30.621 --> 00:15:31.454
<v Speaker 2>understand what can happen and what can </v>
<v Speaker 2>go wrong in talking about it with the </v>

410
00:15:37.101 --> 00:15:40.820
<v Speaker 2>same sort of language that you would use</v>
<v Speaker 2>to describe office politics.</v>

411
00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:42.230
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

412
00:15:42.231 --> 00:15:45.770
<v Speaker 2>I they got to say that's what damn it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I was trying to say.</v>

413
00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:47.060
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how you feel,</v>

414
00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:49.640
<v Speaker 2>how do you feel about this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't want a bad work environment.</v>

415
00:15:49.641 --> 00:15:52.400
<v Speaker 2>Should we torture right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We want to save lives,</v>

416
00:15:52.401 --> 00:15:55.010
<v Speaker 2>but we don't want this guy to feel bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't want him to feel bad.</v>

417
00:15:55.011 --> 00:15:55.790
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

418
00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:57.190
<v Speaker 2>there was actually this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

419
00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:59.270
<v Speaker 2>some people were entertaining the idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

420
00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:00.123
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Khaleed Sheikh Mohammed would come out </v>

421
00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:04.400
<v Speaker 2>and talk to the senators.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

422
00:16:04.401 --> 00:16:05.234
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you're going through this </v>

423
00:16:05.841 --> 00:16:09.830
<v Speaker 2>confirmation process about what his </v>
<v Speaker 2>feelings,</v>

424
00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:10.340
<v Speaker 2>we'll clean check.</v>

425
00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:11.173
<v Speaker 2>Muhammad was a mastermind of nine 11 and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he actually requested to talk about her </v>

426
00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:17.661
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And about,</v>

427
00:16:17.661 --> 00:16:20.480
<v Speaker 2>about his [inaudible] just wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 2>reflect on the,</v>

428
00:16:20.481 --> 00:16:21.860
<v Speaker 2>had the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

429
00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:24.440
<v Speaker 2>from his perspective and isn't he still </v>
<v Speaker 2>locked up?</v>

430
00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:26.510
<v Speaker 2>He shown Guantanamo Bay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

431
00:16:26.511 --> 00:16:28.130
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God forbid he should rot in jail,</v>

432
00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:29.990
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

433
00:16:29.991 --> 00:16:31.850
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of where we,</v>

434
00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:33.980
<v Speaker 2>that's sort of where we've come to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think in part,</v>

435
00:16:33.981 --> 00:16:35.060
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's distance,</v>

436
00:16:35.061 --> 00:16:36.020
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's two months.</v>

437
00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:39.250
<v Speaker 2>And so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

438
00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:40.370
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she showed again,</v>

439
00:16:40.371 --> 00:16:42.320
<v Speaker 2>she should be confirmed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

440
00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:43.603
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole rendition interrogation </v>

441
00:16:44.811 --> 00:16:47.960
<v Speaker 2>program was reviewed at Nauseum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of pages written.</v>

442
00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:50.660
<v Speaker 2>And interestingly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the people up there on the hill</v>

443
00:16:50.661 --> 00:16:51.494
<v Speaker 2>right now in this confirmation process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the senators who are saying that they </v>

444
00:16:54.861 --> 00:16:57.230
<v Speaker 2>need to know more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the same ones who were there before.</v>

445
00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:59.750
<v Speaker 2>So theoretically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>either they didn't read all the material</v>

446
00:16:59.751 --> 00:17:02.330
<v Speaker 2>that was given to them about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they've forgotten it,</v>

447
00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:03.440
<v Speaker 2>where there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

448
00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:06.320
<v Speaker 2>or in reality this is more about trump </v>
<v Speaker 2>than it is about her,</v>

449
00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:11.570
<v Speaker 2>which I don't want to be shocking anyone</v>
<v Speaker 2>by saying that perhaps there's political</v>

450
00:17:11.571 --> 00:17:12.404
<v Speaker 2>grandstanding going on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she is eminently qualified and it </v>

451
00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:16.070
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

452
00:17:16.070 --> 00:17:17.580
<v Speaker 2>it wouldn't happen up there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not In America,</v>

453
00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:19.160
<v Speaker 2>maybe somewhere else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not here.</v>

454
00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:21.560
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you support her.</v>

455
00:17:21.561 --> 00:17:23.800
<v Speaker 2>He thinks she's an excellent choice and </v>
<v Speaker 2>look seven,</v>

456
00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:25.510
<v Speaker 2>seven operational tours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

457
00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:26.503
<v Speaker 2>several management positions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I guess at the end of the day it </v>

458
00:17:29.001 --> 00:17:30.340
<v Speaker 2>comes down to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

459
00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:34.970
<v Speaker 2>I would rather have somebody who's gone </v>
<v Speaker 2>through that experience.</v>

460
00:17:34.971 --> 00:17:35.804
<v Speaker 2>She played a small role.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was not as a senior person by the </v>

461
00:17:37.521 --> 00:17:38.354
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>John Brennan was far more senior in the </v>

462
00:17:39.441 --> 00:17:42.080
<v Speaker 2>organization at the time of that program</v>
<v Speaker 2>being run.</v>

463
00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:45.740
<v Speaker 2>And he was confirmed as President </v>
<v Speaker 2>Obama's director.</v>

464
00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:46.923
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so maybe the senators have a different </v>

465
00:17:47.901 --> 00:17:50.130
<v Speaker 2>standard for a female candidate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

466
00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:53.610
<v Speaker 2>But do you think it's down or anything?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's maybe more time since nine,</v>

467
00:17:53.611 --> 00:17:54.630
<v Speaker 2>11.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

468
00:17:54.631 --> 00:17:59.631
<v Speaker 2>obviously Obama came into office,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was not that long after nine 11,</v>

469
00:17:59.971 --> 00:18:01.200
<v Speaker 2>there was still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

470
00:18:01.201 --> 00:18:03.960
<v Speaker 2>seven years later still thoughts in </v>
<v Speaker 2>people's mind about it.</v>

471
00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:04.831
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting enough,</v>

472
00:18:04.831 --> 00:18:07.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean that was in 2013 when he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>confirmed,</v>

473
00:18:07.111 --> 00:18:11.160
<v Speaker 2>but in 2009 he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they wanted to confirm it or they wanted</v>

474
00:18:11.161 --> 00:18:13.950
<v Speaker 2>to bring him up as the appointee for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>director of the CIA.</v>

475
00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:15.243
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would have been president Obama's </v>

476
00:18:16.051 --> 00:18:16.884
<v Speaker 2>first term,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they decided not to because for the </v>

477
00:18:18.931 --> 00:18:21.120
<v Speaker 2>reason that they thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well maybe it's too close to after the,</v>

478
00:18:21.121 --> 00:18:24.390
<v Speaker 2>and they didn't want to go through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>heartburn of having this process.</v>

479
00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:26.520
<v Speaker 2>So instead they brought him into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>White House.</v>

480
00:18:26.521 --> 00:18:27.354
<v Speaker 2>He became assistant to the president and</v>
<v Speaker 2>deputy national security dude for </v>

481
00:18:30.361 --> 00:18:31.194
<v Speaker 2>counter terrorism.</v>

482
00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:33.570
<v Speaker 2>And then four years later they brought </v>
<v Speaker 2>him in as a,</v>

483
00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:34.493
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then confirmed him as the director for </v>

484
00:18:36.361 --> 00:18:37.194
<v Speaker 2>the CIA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

485
00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:38.490
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess,</v>

486
00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:41.310
<v Speaker 2>and he has now come out in support of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Gina Hospital,</v>

487
00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:42.343
<v Speaker 2>the new director designate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think she will get there as she </v>

488
00:18:45.121 --> 00:18:47.970
<v Speaker 2>should.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The focus should be going forward.</v>

489
00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:50.430
<v Speaker 2>She's been very clear about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not revisiting the old,</v>

490
00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:53.000
<v Speaker 2>the old days of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a rendition interrogation.</v>

491
00:18:53.001 --> 00:18:56.450
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she's been very clear about that and</v>

492
00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:58.710
<v Speaker 2>including today during the hearing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So hopefully,</v>

493
00:18:58.740 --> 00:18:59.850
<v Speaker 2>hopefully it'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll,</v>

494
00:18:59.851 --> 00:19:00.684
<v Speaker 2>it'll get done because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be nice to think the senators </v>

495
00:19:02.971 --> 00:19:06.690
<v Speaker 2>would do their job and choose somebody </v>
<v Speaker 2>who's appropriate for the job.</v>

496
00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:07.703
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

497
00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:08.993
<v Speaker 2>it's strange who gets to choose and who </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't get to choose who runs an </v>

498
00:19:12.721 --> 00:19:17.721
<v Speaker 2>organization like the CIA and whether or</v>
<v Speaker 2>not they have an actual understanding of</v>

499
00:19:17.821 --> 00:19:19.110
<v Speaker 2>what goes on behind the scenes.</v>

500
00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:20.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a really good,</v>

501
00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:21.783
<v Speaker 2>it's a good point because some of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>questions today from some of the </v>

502
00:19:23.011 --> 00:19:26.420
<v Speaker 2>senators made you believe that perhaps </v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't really do that.</v>

503
00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:27.630
<v Speaker 2>I don't want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be Glib,</v>

504
00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:28.201
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

505
00:19:28.201 --> 00:19:30.250
<v Speaker 2>they all sit on the committees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They theoretically are,</v>

506
00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:31.860
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are privy to all this information.</v>

507
00:19:31.861 --> 00:19:32.694
<v Speaker 2>There is a very well worn path that goes</v>
<v Speaker 2>from lying light where the agency </v>

508
00:19:35.311 --> 00:19:36.144
<v Speaker 2>headquarters is based up to Capitol Hill</v>
<v Speaker 2>from briefers going back and forth and </v>

509
00:19:41.551 --> 00:19:44.190
<v Speaker 2>back and forth and discussing programs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that,</v>

510
00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:45.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the classified material,</v>

511
00:19:45.451 --> 00:19:46.530
<v Speaker 2>but these people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that gang of eight,</v>

512
00:19:46.531 --> 00:19:48.420
<v Speaker 2>that people that are the minority </v>
<v Speaker 2>majority leaders,</v>

513
00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:50.910
<v Speaker 2>the heads of the committees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Intel committees,</v>

514
00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:52.053
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all privy to this information </v>

515
00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:53.963
<v Speaker 2>and they were all privy to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>information about the rendition program </v>

516
00:19:55.531 --> 00:19:59.100
<v Speaker 2>and the interrogation program.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they all knew about it.</v>

517
00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:00.870
<v Speaker 2>There were no objections raised at that </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

518
00:20:00.871 --> 00:20:01.411
<v Speaker 2>2000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>

519
00:20:01.411 --> 00:20:03.240
<v Speaker 2>2003.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So these people all knew about it.</v>

520
00:20:03.241 --> 00:20:04.074
<v Speaker 2>So maybe those senators are asking her </v>
<v Speaker 2>how she feels about it now maybe they </v>

521
00:20:07.321 --> 00:20:08.154
<v Speaker 2>should turn around and look in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mirror and ask themselves how they feel </v>

522
00:20:09.301 --> 00:20:10.590
<v Speaker 2>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're not going to do that.</v>

523
00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:12.640
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that and I,</v>

524
00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:15.120
<v Speaker 2>enough set,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's eminently qualified should happen.</v>

525
00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:17.070
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we've got big issues.</v>

526
00:20:17.071 --> 00:20:18.330
<v Speaker 2>We got it wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've got North Korea,</v>

527
00:20:18.331 --> 00:20:22.440
<v Speaker 2>we've got the dealings with China in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>south and the South Pacific.</v>

528
00:20:22.441 --> 00:20:25.540
<v Speaker 2>We got issues with Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had a lot of things going on.</v>

529
00:20:25.541 --> 00:20:26.374
<v Speaker 2>What I really wanted to ask you about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause we've been discussing this and I </v>

530
00:20:28.141 --> 00:20:29.940
<v Speaker 2>don't really understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

531
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.260
<v Speaker 2>it was about wowway that a Chinese </v>
<v Speaker 2>company,</v>

532
00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:35.113
<v Speaker 2>electronics company,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they make these tick ass phones and the </v>

533
00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:41.910
<v Speaker 2>State Department has said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please do not buy them.</v>

534
00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:43.190
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

535
00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:45.950
<v Speaker 2>Along with cte and other corporation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

536
00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:48.183
<v Speaker 2>if you start from the premise that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>China is the number one perpetrator of </v>

537
00:20:53.441 --> 00:20:56.200
<v Speaker 2>economic espionage and theft of </v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectual property,</v>

538
00:20:56.770 --> 00:20:57.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and also by the way,</v>

539
00:20:57.941 --> 00:21:00.910
<v Speaker 2>the number one perpetrator out there of </v>
<v Speaker 2>cyber shenanigans,</v>

540
00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:02.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>activity in cyberspace</v>

541
00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:03.413
<v Speaker 3>because so bad with that theft of </v>
<v Speaker 3>intellectual property that they have </v>

542
00:21:06.061 --> 00:21:11.061
<v Speaker 3>fake apple stores over in China with all</v>
<v Speaker 3>fake apple stuff.</v>

543
00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:13.740
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fake apple laptops,</v>

544
00:21:13.741 --> 00:21:16.020
<v Speaker 3>fake apple phones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything fake.</v>

545
00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:20.220
<v Speaker 3>The labels look identical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>None of it is actually apple products.</v>

546
00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:23.460
<v Speaker 3>And it all works frankly as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does this,</v>

547
00:21:23.610 --> 00:21:25.080
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all good stuff.</v>

548
00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:25.913
<v Speaker 2>Enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

549
00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:26.813
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

550
00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:28.300
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

551
00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:29.101
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

552
00:21:29.101 --> 00:21:33.980
<v Speaker 2>it's astounding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the reason why they're,</v>

553
00:21:33.981 --> 00:21:34.814
<v Speaker 2>they're raising the alarm with Huawei </v>
<v Speaker 2>and zte is because of the voracious </v>

554
00:21:39.721 --> 00:21:44.721
<v Speaker 2>appetite of the Chinese government and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the commercial sector for information.</v>

555
00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:48.503
<v Speaker 2>And it's a little bit like shutting the </v>
<v Speaker 2>door after the horse is headed down the </v>

556
00:21:53.281 --> 00:21:54.114
<v Speaker 2>hill because we're late to the game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've been doing this for years and </v>

557
00:21:57.871 --> 00:22:00.300
<v Speaker 2>years and years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've been oddly enough of it,</v>

558
00:22:00.301 --> 00:22:02.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of our military gear have parts in</v>

559
00:22:02.601 --> 00:22:04.290
<v Speaker 2>a manufacturing in China.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

560
00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:05.890
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

561
00:22:05.891 --> 00:22:06.724
<v Speaker 2>if we should have been raising the </v>
<v Speaker 2>concern about this and talking with </v>

562
00:22:10.741 --> 00:22:14.250
<v Speaker 2>China and trying to come to terms with </v>
<v Speaker 2>this issue years ago,</v>

563
00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:14.861
<v Speaker 2>I mean we get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

564
00:22:14.861 --> 00:22:15.694
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're trying to have that conversation </v>

565
00:22:16.561 --> 00:22:19.420
<v Speaker 2>with them now and up on Capitol Hill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

566
00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:20.263
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the congress is trying to enact </v>

567
00:22:21.961 --> 00:22:24.210
<v Speaker 2>legislation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of like this quality thing.</v>

568
00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:25.463
<v Speaker 2>They're doing it in a clumsy fashion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the overriding principle is correct </v>

569
00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:31.890
<v Speaker 2>in that China made some decisions years </v>
<v Speaker 2>ago,</v>

570
00:22:31.910 --> 00:22:32.743
<v Speaker 2>that they were going to become a major </v>
<v Speaker 2>power in the world in a certain </v>

571
00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:39.750
<v Speaker 2>timeframe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to do that,</v>

572
00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:40.883
<v Speaker 2>by definition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to compress your research and </v>

573
00:22:42.691 --> 00:22:43.670
<v Speaker 2>development time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

574
00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:47.070
<v Speaker 2>And as one way to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And essentially,</v>

575
00:22:47.071 --> 00:22:47.904
<v Speaker 2>and that's the steal information to </v>
<v Speaker 2>acquire information if I want to be </v>

576
00:22:50.341 --> 00:22:53.730
<v Speaker 2>diplomatic about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what they've done.</v>

577
00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:54.653
<v Speaker 2>Japan came out of World War II and their</v>
<v Speaker 2>idea was we're going to become a major </v>

578
00:22:56.701 --> 00:22:58.650
<v Speaker 2>power through manufacturing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they did,</v>

579
00:22:58.651 --> 00:23:01.320
<v Speaker 2>they built up their manufacturing base </v>
<v Speaker 2>and created this,</v>

580
00:23:01.321 --> 00:23:02.010
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

581
00:23:02.010 --> 00:23:02.843
<v Speaker 2>this amazing result.</v>
<v Speaker 2>China decided we're going to skip the R </v>

582
00:23:05.401 --> 00:23:07.060
<v Speaker 2>and d for the most part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

583
00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:10.830
<v Speaker 2>and all of that entails the cost and </v>
<v Speaker 2>time involved.</v>

584
00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:13.320
<v Speaker 2>And they've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're very adept at it.</v>

585
00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:14.333
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they throw an enormous amount of </v>

586
00:23:15.211 --> 00:23:17.400
<v Speaker 2>resource out there into hoovering up </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>

587
00:23:17.401 --> 00:23:18.810
<v Speaker 2>not just from us but from everybody.</v>

588
00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:20.183
<v Speaker 2>And using that to advance their goals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have no firewall between their </v>

589
00:23:24.991 --> 00:23:25.824
<v Speaker 2>Intel service and the PLA,</v>
<v Speaker 2>military intelligence and others and </v>

590
00:23:28.831 --> 00:23:30.840
<v Speaker 2>their commercial sector.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

591
00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:32.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only are they,</v>

592
00:23:32.231 --> 00:23:35.070
<v Speaker 2>they are to protect national security,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're there to promote,</v>

593
00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:37.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the commercial side of,</v>

594
00:23:37.381 --> 00:23:39.340
<v Speaker 2>of China.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

595
00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:40.223
<v Speaker 2>and that's why it's so important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's why they're there talking </v>

596
00:23:41.701 --> 00:23:43.050
<v Speaker 2>about Huawei,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

597
00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:45.290
<v Speaker 2>because of the potential for them to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

598
00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:47.090
<v Speaker 2>use their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

599
00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:48.650
<v Speaker 2>their reach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

600
00:23:48.651 --> 00:23:51.740
<v Speaker 2>to further their desire for information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever it may be.</v>

601
00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:54.830
<v Speaker 2>They'll hoover it up and then decide </v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's useful or not.</v>

602
00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:57.110
<v Speaker 2>But they have the resource to do that as</v>
<v Speaker 2>opposed to,</v>

603
00:23:57.310 --> 00:23:58.143
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a smaller country that maybe doesn't </v>

604
00:23:58.821 --> 00:23:59.654
<v Speaker 2>have the resource and is much more </v>
<v Speaker 2>targeted and focused on their Intel </v>

605
00:24:02.601 --> 00:24:04.760
<v Speaker 2>collection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are there efforts to gather information?</v>

606
00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:07.390
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's sort of the,</v>

607
00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:10.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was a wordy explanation.</v>

608
00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:11.210
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it makes sense.</v>

609
00:24:11.211 --> 00:24:13.640
<v Speaker 3>And it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I read it,</v>

610
00:24:13.641 --> 00:24:14.474
<v Speaker 3>I read a bunch of tech articles where </v>
<v Speaker 3>people were questioning whether or not </v>

611
00:24:17.541 --> 00:24:21.260
<v Speaker 3>it's even possible for while way to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>using those phones to spy on people.</v>

612
00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:25.970
<v Speaker 3>But then there was some other articles </v>
<v Speaker 3>where while we was being charged with a,</v>

613
00:24:25.971 --> 00:24:27.560
<v Speaker 3>what was it again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were using,</v>

614
00:24:27.561 --> 00:24:29.930
<v Speaker 3>there were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were selling illegal technology to</v>

615
00:24:29.931 --> 00:24:31.760
<v Speaker 3>Iran.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was,</v>

616
00:24:31.761 --> 00:24:32.630
<v Speaker 3>there was something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were,</v>

617
00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:34.130
<v Speaker 3>they were breaking the sanctions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

618
00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:35.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were,</v>

619
00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:37.390
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

620
00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:39.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying I say that correct.</v>

621
00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:41.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were.</v>

622
00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:44.970
<v Speaker 3>But is that what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they were,</v>

623
00:24:44.971 --> 00:24:48.810
<v Speaker 3>they were selling things to Iran and </v>
<v Speaker 3>this was a big part of it,</v>

624
00:24:48.811 --> 00:24:49.644
<v Speaker 3>that they were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the tech people were saying they </v>

625
00:24:51.431 --> 00:24:55.080
<v Speaker 3>were incredulous here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Walway under is that you again,</v>

626
00:24:55.081 --> 00:24:56.730
<v Speaker 3>you son of a bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>

627
00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:59.720
<v Speaker 2>I've turned this thing off to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand why it keeps going.</v>

628
00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:02.683
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I been dope.</v>

629
00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:04.490
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would put it on airplane mode,</v>

630
00:25:04.491 --> 00:25:07.520
<v Speaker 2>but I don't have a clue how to put it on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the swipe up from the bottom.</v>

631
00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:10.820
<v Speaker 2>Swipe up from the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

632
00:25:10.821 --> 00:25:13.670
<v Speaker 2>Everybody get your phones or your watch </v>
<v Speaker 2>is ringing?</v>

633
00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:15.950
<v Speaker 2>Watch out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like Dick Tracy,</v>

634
00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:18.290
<v Speaker 2>it really does feel like Dick Tracy when</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were kids.</v>

635
00:25:18.291 --> 00:25:20.900
<v Speaker 2>The idea of talking on your phone be so </v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous.</v>

636
00:25:20.901 --> 00:25:22.870
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's never going to happen.</v>

637
00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:28.130
<v Speaker 2>You've got your password on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Christ.</v>

638
00:25:28.131 --> 00:25:29.690
<v Speaker 2>You take it off the path or it comes on </v>
<v Speaker 2>immediately.</v>

639
00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:31.060
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you just take it down.</v>

640
00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:32.000
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a dial tone.</v>

641
00:25:32.001 --> 00:25:33.260
<v Speaker 2>That's set.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a keyboard.</v>

642
00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:34.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know.</v>

643
00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:37.453
<v Speaker 2>I can't right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People to think and really that guy </v>

644
00:25:38.541 --> 00:25:40.170
<v Speaker 2>worked like I worked at the CIA.</v>

645
00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:42.290
<v Speaker 2>Let's listen to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's perfect.</v>

646
00:25:42.291 --> 00:25:43.530
<v Speaker 2>Would you call?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully they,</v>

647
00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:44.463
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hilarious because you're talking </v>

648
00:25:46.131 --> 00:25:50.330
<v Speaker 2>about technology and then this happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're talking about whether or not we</v>

649
00:25:50.331 --> 00:25:51.164
<v Speaker 2>should be worried about walway and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't even figure out how to use your </v>

650
00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:54.190
<v Speaker 2>fucker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

651
00:25:54.650 --> 00:25:55.483
<v Speaker 2>that's perfectly understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But anybody that knows me knows that </v>

652
00:25:57.201 --> 00:25:58.570
<v Speaker 2>that's the case because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

653
00:25:59.150 --> 00:26:00.600
<v Speaker 2>to be fair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back in the old days I,</v>

654
00:26:00.670 --> 00:26:01.503
<v Speaker 2>we encompasses and maps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but even when we started developing new </v>

655
00:26:04.881 --> 00:26:06.740
<v Speaker 2>technology and cure it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quite frankly,</v>

656
00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:08.373
<v Speaker 2>if you've got to go out and do anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if first thing you do is throw </v>

657
00:26:10.671 --> 00:26:12.030
<v Speaker 2>everything away that's got a battery in </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

658
00:26:12.610 --> 00:26:13.443
<v Speaker 2>And so we weren't necessarily getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>dumb it down because you assumed </v>

659
00:26:16.991 --> 00:26:19.610
<v Speaker 2>something's gonna go wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And usually it does.</v>

660
00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:23.510
<v Speaker 2>And usually it's based on kit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on gear.</v>

661
00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:24.920
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

662
00:26:24.921 --> 00:26:27.050
<v Speaker 2>I never really became very adept at it.</v>

663
00:26:27.050 --> 00:26:27.950
<v Speaker 2>We've got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got a,</v>

664
00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:32.040
<v Speaker 2>I got a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's three little boys scooter sluggo</v>

665
00:26:32.050 --> 00:26:35.770
<v Speaker 2>on and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I got delirious names and they're,</v>

666
00:26:35.771 --> 00:26:37.310
<v Speaker 2>they're hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's great kids.</v>

667
00:26:37.311 --> 00:26:40.760
<v Speaker 2>But we got a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got a gaming system and I'm trying to</v>

668
00:26:40.761 --> 00:26:43.220
<v Speaker 2>remember what the hell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>xbox or playstation,</v>

669
00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:44.790
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>xbox,</v>

670
00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:48.330
<v Speaker 2>xbox and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause my youngest mugsy,</v>

671
00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:49.230
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

672
00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:50.250
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's always six.</v>

673
00:26:50.251 --> 00:26:51.090
<v Speaker 2>And so he still says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

674
00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:52.800
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's thrilled or pronounces words,</v>

675
00:26:52.801 --> 00:26:53.710
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's x,</v>

676
00:26:53.890 --> 00:26:56.610
<v Speaker 2>x patch and it's really cute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't do it.</v>

677
00:26:56.611 --> 00:26:57.800
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it sounds stupid when I do it.</v>

678
00:26:57.810 --> 00:26:59.040
<v Speaker 2>What he does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's enormously cute.</v>

679
00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:02.760
<v Speaker 2>So we get to sing and I'll sit there </v>
<v Speaker 2>with them and try to play like NBA Two k</v>

680
00:27:02.761 --> 00:27:06.400
<v Speaker 2>or something and it just doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not intuitive to me.</v>

681
00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:08.160
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing that's intuitive about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

682
00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:11.530
<v Speaker 2>Know how to find Shit and press the </v>
<v Speaker 2>right button.</v>

683
00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:14.340
<v Speaker 2>They're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just assume they're going to get it</v>

684
00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:15.240
<v Speaker 2>online.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

685
00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:17.400
<v Speaker 3>Hidden characters by moving the joystick</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dick.</v>

686
00:27:17.401 --> 00:27:18.170
<v Speaker 3>A funny way.</v>

687
00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:18.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mugs.</v>

688
00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:19.673
<v Speaker 2>He talks to the Lebron James directly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apparently they communicate through </v>

689
00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:24.420
<v Speaker 2>x-box now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>

690
00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:26.033
<v Speaker 3>The tech people that are skeptical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they're saying is that if walway </v>

691
00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:35.530
<v Speaker 3>really did have something in their </v>
<v Speaker 3>phones that allow them to spy on people,</v>

692
00:27:35.890 --> 00:27:38.530
<v Speaker 3>you'd be able to find it and the tech </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys would find it.</v>

693
00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:39.983
<v Speaker 3>Do you buy that?</v>

694
00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:43.530
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

695
00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:45.630
<v Speaker 2>here's what I would say about that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

696
00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:47.620
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure,</v>

697
00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:48.563
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's obviously a lot of very smart </v>

698
00:27:49.831 --> 00:27:53.670
<v Speaker 2>tech guys and within a diligence for all</v>
<v Speaker 2>your information and security needs,</v>

699
00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:54.773
<v Speaker 2>we have some very smart tech people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you're talking about the </v>

700
00:27:58.561 --> 00:28:03.090
<v Speaker 2>Chinese state and the resources and </v>
<v Speaker 2>capabilities that that entails,</v>

701
00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:04.620
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

702
00:28:04.621 --> 00:28:06.990
<v Speaker 2>If you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're saying that NSA could possibly</v>

703
00:28:06.991 --> 00:28:07.824
<v Speaker 2>detect this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you're talking about just </v>

704
00:28:08.911 --> 00:28:09.744
<v Speaker 2>dispersing kid out into the marketplace </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the way that that thing gets spread </v>

705
00:28:13.381 --> 00:28:15.980
<v Speaker 2>and disseminated and inserted into </v>
<v Speaker 2>companies and,</v>

706
00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.700
<v Speaker 2>and then potentially allow us points of </v>
<v Speaker 2>access into these businesses.</v>

707
00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:21.690
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter,</v>

708
00:28:21.691 --> 00:28:23.460
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like they just have to go after</v>

709
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:24.833
<v Speaker 2>ibm or Raytheon or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going after everything because </v>

710
00:28:27.001 --> 00:28:28.920
<v Speaker 2>it potentially is all of interest to </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

711
00:28:29.010 --> 00:28:29.843
<v Speaker 3>So their ideas to just steal as much </v>
<v Speaker 3>technology and as much intellectual </v>

712
00:28:33.241 --> 00:28:35.470
<v Speaker 3>properties they can and recreate it over</v>

713
00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:36.820
<v Speaker 2>China.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That has been the,</v>

714
00:28:36.850 --> 00:28:37.810
<v Speaker 2>the plan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to keep,</v>

715
00:28:37.970 --> 00:28:38.980
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

716
00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:40.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>demonize an entire nation,</v>

717
00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:42.513
<v Speaker 2>but they have proven themselves </v>
<v Speaker 2>enormously adapted doing this and </v>

718
00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:47.310
<v Speaker 2>they've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

719
00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:48.640
<v Speaker 2>and not that others don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

720
00:28:48.641 --> 00:28:50.560
<v Speaker 2>Russia does the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll have a variety of others,</v>

721
00:28:50.561 --> 00:28:50.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

722
00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:51.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even,</v>

723
00:28:51.910 --> 00:28:52.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of our allies,</v>

724
00:28:52.901 --> 00:28:53.734
<v Speaker 2>everybody if to the degree that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>have the resources and the motivation </v>

725
00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:59.140
<v Speaker 2>and they consider it an issue related to</v>
<v Speaker 2>national security,</v>

726
00:28:59.141 --> 00:29:01.000
<v Speaker 2>whatever it might be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're willing to do it.</v>

727
00:29:01.001 --> 00:29:03.790
<v Speaker 2>They're willing to try.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it is,</v>

728
00:29:03.791 --> 00:29:05.020
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is interesting.</v>

729
00:29:05.021 --> 00:29:05.471
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

730
00:29:05.471 --> 00:29:07.750
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hallway thing and the zte again,</v>

731
00:29:07.751 --> 00:29:08.584
<v Speaker 2>I think the roll out of that con a </v>
<v Speaker 2>concern and the roll out of sort of </v>

732
00:29:11.711 --> 00:29:13.900
<v Speaker 2>trying to provide guidance has been a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little clumsy.</v>

733
00:29:15.490 --> 00:29:16.323
<v Speaker 3>So one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one thing that was speculation was that </v>

734
00:29:19.751 --> 00:29:21.550
<v Speaker 3>people didn't have to worry about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>phones,</v>

735
00:29:21.551 --> 00:29:25.390
<v Speaker 3>but what is essentially they're trying </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do is cripple the company financially</v>

736
00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:26.493
<v Speaker 3>and not allow them to get a foothold in </v>
<v Speaker 3>America because they're the third </v>

737
00:29:28.961 --> 00:29:31.510
<v Speaker 3>largest cell phone manufacturer in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

738
00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:32.890
<v Speaker 3>Number one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>apple,</v>

739
00:29:32.891 --> 00:29:34.030
<v Speaker 3>number two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Samsung,</v>

740
00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:36.160
<v Speaker 3>they're number three.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in America,</v>

741
00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:37.023
<v Speaker 3>no one knows who they are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the idea is what they're trying </v>

742
00:29:38.861 --> 00:29:39.694
<v Speaker 3>to do is make sure that the Chinese </v>
<v Speaker 3>government doesn't get a foothold in </v>

743
00:29:42.371 --> 00:29:43.204
<v Speaker 3>this company,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in this country where those companies </v>

744
00:29:44.690 --> 00:29:47.290
<v Speaker 3>are wowway the company while way becomes</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

745
00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:51.610
<v Speaker 3>a popular brand for people to buy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that would allow them,</v>

746
00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:54.280
<v Speaker 3>even if they didn't have any spy device </v>
<v Speaker 3>on this phone,</v>

747
00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:55.263
<v Speaker 3>it would allow them to get other devices</v>
<v Speaker 3>into people's homes that could </v>

748
00:29:58.121 --> 00:30:00.490
<v Speaker 3>potentially spy on them and then more </v>
<v Speaker 3>importantly,</v>

749
00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:02.530
<v Speaker 3>get into companies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

750
00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:03.393
<v Speaker 3>And spying the companies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this was one of the pieces of </v>

751
00:30:04.811 --> 00:30:05.644
<v Speaker 3>speculation that I read about was that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they had certain servers that were </v>

752
00:30:08.891 --> 00:30:11.260
<v Speaker 3>sending an exorbitant amount of </v>
<v Speaker 3>information,</v>

753
00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:12.303
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>out and they were trying to figure out </v>

754
00:30:13.991 --> 00:30:14.824
<v Speaker 3>what was going on with them and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's like an excessive amount of </v>

755
00:30:17.141 --> 00:30:22.060
<v Speaker 3>information that was data that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>leaving the servers versus coming in and</v>

756
00:30:22.061 --> 00:30:22.894
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this really seems like some fucked up </v>

757
00:30:24.821 --> 00:30:25.960
<v Speaker 3>Shit's going on with this.</v>

758
00:30:26.050 --> 00:30:28.080
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] first of all,</v>

759
00:30:28.081 --> 00:30:30.130
<v Speaker 2>who always already present here in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>country,</v>

760
00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:32.230
<v Speaker 2>they manufacture a lot of things besides</v>
<v Speaker 2>phones.</v>

761
00:30:32.231 --> 00:30:35.820
<v Speaker 2>And so they've already got a pretty big </v>
<v Speaker 2>footprint in this country and,</v>

762
00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:38.270
<v Speaker 2>and with our allies as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

763
00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:39.583
<v Speaker 2>so I think it's smart to consider the </v>
<v Speaker 2>nature of a particular regime or </v>

764
00:30:48.011 --> 00:30:49.270
<v Speaker 2>government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

765
00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:50.133
<v Speaker 2>when you're talking about the potential </v>
<v Speaker 2>for their products to enter into the </v>

766
00:30:56.861 --> 00:31:00.130
<v Speaker 2>commercial sector where they may have </v>
<v Speaker 2>access,</v>

767
00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:01.293
<v Speaker 2>because if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they've shown a pattern of activity </v>

768
00:31:03.850 --> 00:31:07.210
<v Speaker 2>for acquiring intellectual property,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is again,</v>

769
00:31:07.211 --> 00:31:11.290
<v Speaker 2>a very delicate way to put it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I don't think it's a stretch to say</v>

770
00:31:11.291 --> 00:31:14.740
<v Speaker 2>we should be concerned by their efforts </v>
<v Speaker 2>to put,</v>

771
00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:17.290
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>communications gear,</v>

772
00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:19.600
<v Speaker 2>even if it seems pedestrian at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>outset,</v>

773
00:31:20.010 --> 00:31:21.730
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the marketplace.</v>

774
00:31:21.910 --> 00:31:23.750
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure that I'm,</v>

775
00:31:23.770 --> 00:31:24.603
<v Speaker 2>I'm buying the idea that it's some </v>
<v Speaker 2>nefarious plan to shut out Huawei so </v>

776
00:31:27.911 --> 00:31:30.970
<v Speaker 2>that either they don't get a foothold in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the phone business.</v>

777
00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:32.770
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

778
00:31:32.771 --> 00:31:35.750
<v Speaker 2>and I say that because I had been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

779
00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:38.290
<v Speaker 2>30 years I've been dealing with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Chinese,</v>

780
00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:40.120
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in terms of their,</v>

781
00:31:40.121 --> 00:31:42.460
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>efforts to acquire information posted on</v>

782
00:31:42.461 --> 00:31:44.350
<v Speaker 2>the government and commercial side of </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

783
00:31:44.890 --> 00:31:46.130
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

784
00:31:46.150 --> 00:31:48.400
<v Speaker 2>I come at it from a very cynical point </v>
<v Speaker 2>of view,</v>

785
00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:50.880
<v Speaker 2>a much like I did with the Iranian issue</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

786
00:31:50.881 --> 00:31:54.160
<v Speaker 2>and the likelihood that they have not </v>
<v Speaker 2>been living up to,</v>

787
00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:55.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

788
00:31:55.241 --> 00:31:58.090
<v Speaker 2>they're part of the bargain and people </v>
<v Speaker 2>will say,</v>

789
00:31:58.091 --> 00:31:58.601
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

790
00:31:58.601 --> 00:31:59.700
<v Speaker 2>I go back to the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

791
00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:00.553
<v Speaker 2>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boy them inspecting and they've been </v>

792
00:32:01.121 --> 00:32:02.320
<v Speaker 2>complying with all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

793
00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:03.480
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

794
00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:08.110
<v Speaker 2>there's limited amount of inspection </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we have to their civilian sites and</v>

795
00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:10.510
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] it's not a secret,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

796
00:32:10.511 --> 00:32:12.640
<v Speaker 2>at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it shouldn't be a secret that again,</v>

797
00:32:12.641 --> 00:32:14.420
<v Speaker 2>we have no access to their military </v>
<v Speaker 2>facilities.</v>

798
00:32:14.421 --> 00:32:15.540
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

799
00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:16.423
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tend to look at things in that view </v>

800
00:32:18.071 --> 00:32:18.904
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

801
00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:21.100
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I see a pattern of activity,</v>

802
00:32:21.390 --> 00:32:21.881
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

803
00:32:21.881 --> 00:32:22.714
<v Speaker 2>I'm very reluctant to think they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>somehow going to stop that pattern of </v>

804
00:32:24.641 --> 00:32:26.200
<v Speaker 2>activity for whatever reason.</v>

805
00:32:26.290 --> 00:32:27.700
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>North Korea,</v>

806
00:32:27.701 --> 00:32:29.020
<v Speaker 2>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem with all of this,</v>

807
00:32:29.021 --> 00:32:29.831
<v Speaker 2>North Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Iran,</v>

808
00:32:29.831 --> 00:32:30.970
<v Speaker 2>Syria,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and chemical weapons.</v>

809
00:32:31.270 --> 00:32:33.310
<v Speaker 2>The problem with all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I realize I'm kind of jumping around and</v>

810
00:32:33.311 --> 00:32:34.190
<v Speaker 2>I've just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

811
00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:35.040
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

812
00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:37.300
<v Speaker 2>walway's over here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but is,</v>

813
00:32:37.301 --> 00:32:38.920
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the verification.</v>

814
00:32:39.410 --> 00:32:40.243
<v Speaker 2>It's always the week Lincoln,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any type of agreement related to a </v>

815
00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:46.250
<v Speaker 2>containing a weapons program is </v>
<v Speaker 2>verification.</v>

816
00:32:46.251 --> 00:32:48.190
<v Speaker 2>And we know that we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

817
00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:49.850
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's something we should know anyway.</v>

818
00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:51.620
<v Speaker 2>We keep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we seem to keep forgetting it.</v>

819
00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:53.120
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

820
00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:56.570
<v Speaker 2>unless we can lock that down with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>North Koreans,</v>

821
00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:57.681
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

822
00:32:57.681 --> 00:32:58.514
<v Speaker 2>a deal with them or a deal with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Iranians or deal with a Syrians over </v>

823
00:33:00.621 --> 00:33:02.560
<v Speaker 2>their chemical weapons efforts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

824
00:33:02.610 --> 00:33:04.070
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not worth anything.</v>

825
00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:06.560
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where the focus has to be.</v>

826
00:33:06.890 --> 00:33:07.723
<v Speaker 2>And for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the previous administration was keen to </v>

827
00:33:10.191 --> 00:33:11.024
<v Speaker 2>get this deal done and they were willing</v>
<v Speaker 2>to set aside this issue of all the </v>

828
00:33:14.001 --> 00:33:17.060
<v Speaker 2>military sites set aside the issue of </v>
<v Speaker 2>ballistic missiles.</v>

829
00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:17.893
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that deal that president has just </v>

830
00:33:20.031 --> 00:33:20.864
<v Speaker 2>scuttled,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did nothing to impact or effect or tamp </v>

831
00:33:25.951 --> 00:33:26.784
<v Speaker 2>down or moderate their behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've got more influenced in the </v>

832
00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:33.170
<v Speaker 2>Middle East and they've had ever before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're engaged in more,</v>

833
00:33:33.410 --> 00:33:35.570
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>activity related to,</v>

834
00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:37.730
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

835
00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:39.950
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the countries in the Middle East against</v>

836
00:33:39.951 --> 00:33:42.320
<v Speaker 2>our interests other than they have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

837
00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:44.840
<v Speaker 2>in decades.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>

838
00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:47.090
<v Speaker 2>that all by itself should tell us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

839
00:33:47.670 --> 00:33:48.503
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that they're using all </v>

840
00:33:49.041 --> 00:33:51.170
<v Speaker 2>the money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We gave them to a support,</v>

841
00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:52.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

842
00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:56.810
<v Speaker 2>actions against our interest by </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hezbollah or by a revolutionary guard or</v>

843
00:33:56.811 --> 00:33:58.430
<v Speaker 2>others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they are.</v>

844
00:33:59.030 --> 00:34:01.060
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

845
00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:01.610
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

846
00:34:01.610 --> 00:34:02.443
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a lot of angst over the </v>

847
00:34:03.291 --> 00:34:04.124
<v Speaker 2>idea that we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we step away from the deal for a period </v>

848
00:34:05.661 --> 00:34:06.494
<v Speaker 2>of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe we can come up with something </v>

849
00:34:06.831 --> 00:34:07.664
<v Speaker 2>better and we should,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we should always keep the mock a </v>

850
00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:10.543
<v Speaker 2>diplomacy open,</v>
<v Speaker 2>always have a channel of communications </v>

851
00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:13.310
<v Speaker 2>that's important.</v>

852
00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:14.173
<v Speaker 2>Keep doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but be pragmatic and realistic about </v>

853
00:34:16.551 --> 00:34:17.900
<v Speaker 2>what you got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And right now we don't,</v>

854
00:34:17.901 --> 00:34:20.420
<v Speaker 2>we don't have that much and don't buy </v>
<v Speaker 2>walway phones.</v>

855
00:34:20.490 --> 00:34:21.323
<v Speaker 2>Don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

856
00:34:21.590 --> 00:34:23.580
<v Speaker 2>Interesting that actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kayla,</v>

857
00:34:23.590 --> 00:34:24.423
<v Speaker 2>I know they make a great father,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that came up in that and the CIA </v>

858
00:34:26.841 --> 00:34:27.950
<v Speaker 2>confirmation hearing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>

859
00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:29.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They literally said,</v>

860
00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:32.600
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget which senator it was asked Gina</v>

861
00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:33.433
<v Speaker 2>Hospital about Huawei and zte and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know where they were going with </v>

862
00:34:38.361 --> 00:34:40.070
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then it devolved into just trying to</v>

863
00:34:40.071 --> 00:34:42.230
<v Speaker 2>get us all those Senate confirmation </v>
<v Speaker 2>questions do,</v>

864
00:34:42.231 --> 00:34:43.390
<v Speaker 2>it just comes at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

865
00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:44.031
<v Speaker 2>the senator saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

866
00:34:44.031 --> 00:34:45.770
<v Speaker 2>I just want a yes or a no answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

867
00:34:46.010 --> 00:34:46.843
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>

868
00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:48.530
<v Speaker 2>why don't you want some detail?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

869
00:34:48.531 --> 00:34:51.500
<v Speaker 2>so they say yes or no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you buy Huawei in Chino Hospital?</v>

870
00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:52.400
<v Speaker 2>Was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

871
00:34:52.401 --> 00:34:54.170
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't buy a hallway fault.</v>

872
00:34:54.171 --> 00:34:56.270
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's your answer.</v>

873
00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:57.433
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm sure it left a lot of people </v>

874
00:34:58.641 --> 00:34:59.870
<v Speaker 2>wondering and scratching their heads and</v>
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

875
00:34:59.871 --> 00:35:01.510
<v Speaker 2>what are they talking about Chinese </v>
<v Speaker 2>phones for it?</v>

876
00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:04.670
<v Speaker 2>That's a weird thing to ask someone yes </v>
<v Speaker 2>or a no.</v>

877
00:35:04.671 --> 00:35:07.160
<v Speaker 2>It seems like it was pretty complex </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation.</v>

878
00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:08.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you,</v>

879
00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:10.790
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are we gonna take care of North Korea?</v>

880
00:35:10.791 --> 00:35:11.541
<v Speaker 2>Yes or no?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

881
00:35:11.541 --> 00:35:13.400
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

882
00:35:13.401 --> 00:35:13.631
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

883
00:35:13.631 --> 00:35:14.151
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

884
00:35:14.151 --> 00:35:16.580
<v Speaker 2>it becomes a bit of a side show and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>a format as well.</v>

885
00:35:16.610 --> 00:35:18.380
<v Speaker 2>Any confirmation hearing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

886
00:35:18.381 --> 00:35:20.450
<v Speaker 2>five minutes for each senator and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't,</v>

887
00:35:20.451 --> 00:35:21.284
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they spend three minutes making a </v>

888
00:35:22.071 --> 00:35:23.260
<v Speaker 2>statement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

889
00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:26.660
<v Speaker 2>that they can then send back and sound </v>
<v Speaker 2>clips to their constituents.</v>

890
00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:29.300
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe they get a question in and,</v>

891
00:35:29.470 --> 00:35:31.810
<v Speaker 2>and it kind of goes from there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

892
00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:33.950
<v Speaker 2>you don't really learn much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is fine.</v>

893
00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:34.963
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they learned a lot in the closed door </v>

894
00:35:35.871 --> 00:35:36.704
<v Speaker 2>sessions and we rely on the senators to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make decisions when it's classified </v>

895
00:35:39.061 --> 00:35:41.070
<v Speaker 2>information on behalf of the people they</v>
<v Speaker 2>represent.</v>

896
00:35:41.071 --> 00:35:43.020
<v Speaker 2>So that's how it's supposed to work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

897
00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:44.003
<v Speaker 2>What do I know?</v>

898
00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:46.823
<v Speaker 2>I always like to finish my sentences </v>
<v Speaker 2>with what do I know when my wife always </v>

899
00:35:48.271 --> 00:35:48.860
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you talking?</v>

900
00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:52.590
<v Speaker 2>Why do you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you leaving the impression that</v>

901
00:35:52.591 --> 00:35:54.180
<v Speaker 2>you don't know anything?</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are gonna say,</v>

902
00:35:54.181 --> 00:35:57.060
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is he off the hook a little bit when</v>

903
00:35:57.090 --> 00:35:59.940
<v Speaker 2>we get out of here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do I know it is what it is?</v>

904
00:35:59.941 --> 00:36:02.220
<v Speaker 2>Thinking about what I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck do I know?</v>

905
00:36:02.221 --> 00:36:04.850
<v Speaker 2>It's like running up the flag pole to </v>
<v Speaker 2>salutes.</v>

906
00:36:05.310 --> 00:36:06.143
<v Speaker 2>What are you most concerned with?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look at all the international </v>

907
00:36:11.161 --> 00:36:13.660
<v Speaker 2>stuff that's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

908
00:36:13.830 --> 00:36:15.340
<v Speaker 2>that's a really good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

909
00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:18.660
<v Speaker 2>is there one thing that you don't think </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are looking at?</v>

910
00:36:19.350 --> 00:36:20.390
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

911
00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:21.790
<v Speaker 2>I give people a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

912
00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:23.770
<v Speaker 2>a lot of credit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think people are a lot more um,</v>

913
00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:28.740
<v Speaker 2>engaged then sometimes I think the media</v>
<v Speaker 2>gives them credit for,</v>

914
00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:29.953
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean listen to conversations I have </v>

915
00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:33.300
<v Speaker 2>when people want to talk about something</v>
<v Speaker 2>other than Joe Rogan,</v>

916
00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:36.570
<v Speaker 2>I get the impression that they are </v>
<v Speaker 2>paying attention to what's happening out</v>

917
00:36:36.571 --> 00:36:37.090
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

918
00:36:37.090 --> 00:36:39.480
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

919
00:36:39.481 --> 00:36:40.314
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Iran.</v>

920
00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:42.293
<v Speaker 2>Is it a big deal?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it is a big deal but it's a </v>

921
00:36:44.621 --> 00:36:46.420
<v Speaker 2>regional issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

922
00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:49.050
<v Speaker 2>and I think there is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

923
00:36:49.051 --> 00:36:50.910
<v Speaker 2>a way we're going to get some success </v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

924
00:36:50.911 --> 00:36:55.170
<v Speaker 2>I think it actually is going to work out</v>
<v Speaker 2>to our benefit.</v>

925
00:36:55.330 --> 00:36:57.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm not buying the doomsayers you say </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

926
00:36:57.351 --> 00:37:01.410
<v Speaker 2>it's all heading to a conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm not looking at that one.</v>

927
00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:04.920
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing really stands out.</v>

928
00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:05.783
<v Speaker 2>I guess if you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the biggest concern from a </v>

929
00:37:07.861 --> 00:37:10.140
<v Speaker 2>security perspective to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the country,</v>

930
00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:12.540
<v Speaker 2>it would be the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been last year and the year before.</v>

931
00:37:12.541 --> 00:37:13.374
<v Speaker 2>And for a number of years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the frailty of our </v>

932
00:37:15.001 --> 00:37:19.740
<v Speaker 2>infrastructure and its susceptibility to</v>
<v Speaker 2>either cyber attack or physical attack.</v>

933
00:37:20.310 --> 00:37:24.960
<v Speaker 2>And that's the power grid power net,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of that.</v>

934
00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:25.953
<v Speaker 2>The banking system and water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Russian submarines camped out over the </v>

935
00:37:29.281 --> 00:37:31.830
<v Speaker 2>internet lines and the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

936
00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:34.470
<v Speaker 2>which sounds like a cold war movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

937
00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:35.760
<v Speaker 2>But it happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

938
00:37:36.010 --> 00:37:36.843
<v Speaker 2>the Russians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Russians never thought there was a </v>

939
00:37:37.981 --> 00:37:39.620
<v Speaker 2>peace dividend from the end of the Cold </v>
<v Speaker 2>War.</v>

940
00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:41.860
<v Speaker 2>They never thought the Cold War ended.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we,</v>

941
00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:42.763
<v Speaker 2>we all act surprised that Putin was </v>
<v Speaker 2>engaged in meddling in the 2016 </v>

942
00:37:45.481 --> 00:37:46.800
<v Speaker 2>election.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course he was.</v>

943
00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:48.300
<v Speaker 2>They've been through it that forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

944
00:37:48.570 --> 00:37:50.220
<v Speaker 2>and we have to them as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

945
00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:53.190
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about that.</v>

946
00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:59.790
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe from a defensive point of,</v>

947
00:37:59.910 --> 00:38:01.380
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're just looking out for our own.</v>

948
00:38:02.730 --> 00:38:04.540
<v Speaker 2>Here's what I would say about that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

949
00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:05.543
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody speaks from their own </v>

950
00:38:06.271 --> 00:38:08.280
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People have their own perspective.</v>

951
00:38:08.281 --> 00:38:09.960
<v Speaker 2>My perspective is based on what I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>seen,</v>

952
00:38:10.050 --> 00:38:10.771
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

953
00:38:10.771 --> 00:38:13.920
<v Speaker 2>in a lot of places around this planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

954
00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:14.993
<v Speaker 2>we better hope we do it and we've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>hope we do it well because it's a very </v>

955
00:38:18.211 --> 00:38:22.110
<v Speaker 2>aggressive world out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when people kind of roll our eyes</v>

956
00:38:22.111 --> 00:38:23.370
<v Speaker 2>and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh wow,</v>

957
00:38:23.790 --> 00:38:25.290
<v Speaker 2>we do it as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

958
00:38:25.350 --> 00:38:27.330
<v Speaker 2>so we kind of like dismissing the whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>activity.</v>

959
00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:28.410
<v Speaker 2>I guess my point is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

960
00:38:28.411 --> 00:38:29.640
<v Speaker 2>I get what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

961
00:38:29.641 --> 00:38:30.270
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

962
00:38:30.270 --> 00:38:31.103
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying it from a self righteous </v>

963
00:38:31.711 --> 00:38:32.544
<v Speaker 2>point that the Chinese are very good at </v>
<v Speaker 2>acquiring an intellectual property or </v>

964
00:38:35.411 --> 00:38:36.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying it from self righteous </v>
<v Speaker 2>points.</v>

965
00:38:36.701 --> 00:38:38.590
<v Speaker 2>The Russians had been meddling in our </v>
<v Speaker 2>elections.</v>

966
00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:43.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying that's the way it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You better hope we do it very,</v>

967
00:38:43.181 --> 00:38:44.014
<v Speaker 2>very well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my argument for people that are </v>

968
00:38:45.521 --> 00:38:46.900
<v Speaker 2>super progressive and really</v>

969
00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:47.560
<v Speaker 3>bro,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the,</v>

970
00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:49.650
<v Speaker 3>when it comes to these conversations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always say,</v>

971
00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:53.940
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the world is the way it's described,</v>

972
00:38:54.030 --> 00:38:54.863
<v Speaker 3>if China really is constantly meddling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if Russia is really actively trying to </v>

973
00:39:01.021 --> 00:39:05.800
<v Speaker 3>sabotage our elections,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I ran is really doing what the,</v>

974
00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:06.713
<v Speaker 3>what should we do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't think that we should be </v>

975
00:39:08.221 --> 00:39:09.610
<v Speaker 3>involved in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in meddling,</v>

976
00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:10.463
<v Speaker 3>you don't think should be involved in </v>
<v Speaker 3>manipulating or monitoring or making </v>

977
00:39:13.441 --> 00:39:15.990
<v Speaker 3>sure that our interest are safe or that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not going to get attacked.</v>

978
00:39:16.290 --> 00:39:17.880
<v Speaker 3>The idea that we're never going to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>attacked,</v>

979
00:39:17.881 --> 00:39:19.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one's going to get attacked.</v>

980
00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:21.530
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't even,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

981
00:39:21.531 --> 00:39:24.870
<v Speaker 3>you look at human history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is completely preposterous.</v>

982
00:39:25.110 --> 00:39:25.943
<v Speaker 3>The inside of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the tax and all wars going to </v>

983
00:39:27.241 --> 00:39:29.220
<v Speaker 3>somehow or another stop because you eat </v>
<v Speaker 3>vegan.</v>

984
00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:30.910
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fucking crazy.</v>

985
00:39:31.330 --> 00:39:33.850
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a crazy way to look at the world.</v>

986
00:39:33.851 --> 00:39:36.100
<v Speaker 2>And that leaves you incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 2>vulnerable to attack.</v>

987
00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:36.910
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does.</v>

988
00:39:36.910 --> 00:39:37.660
<v Speaker 2>It does it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that,</v>

989
00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:38.890
<v Speaker 2>but you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hadn't thought about it,</v>

990
00:39:38.891 --> 00:39:41.160
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that is this notion that if we,</v>

991
00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:44.020
<v Speaker 2>if we just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to speak to our better angels.</v>

992
00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:46.540
<v Speaker 2>You know Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's great because nobody else is</v>

993
00:39:46.541 --> 00:39:47.374
<v Speaker 2>going to write.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every other nation acts in its own best </v>

994
00:39:49.141 --> 00:39:49.974
<v Speaker 2>interest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we're the ones who seem to always </v>

995
00:39:50.741 --> 00:39:54.040
<v Speaker 2>apologize for it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we better hope that we do because it</v>

996
00:39:54.041 --> 00:39:55.180
<v Speaker 2>is a chaotic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>messy,</v>

997
00:39:55.181 --> 00:39:58.150
<v Speaker 2>aggressive place out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you may want it to be different,</v>

998
00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:00.020
<v Speaker 2>but it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's kind of like that,</v>

999
00:40:00.050 --> 00:40:03.940
<v Speaker 2>that questioning today and the CIA </v>
<v Speaker 2>designate confirmation hearing.</v>

1000
00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:05.470
<v Speaker 2>How do you feel about it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1001
00:40:05.471 --> 00:40:07.540
<v Speaker 2>at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter how you feel about it.</v>

1002
00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:10.000
<v Speaker 2>What are the laws on the books?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Follow those laws,</v>

1003
00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:11.153
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>protecting American interests and in </v>

1004
00:40:12.491 --> 00:40:15.820
<v Speaker 2>national security.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't feel good about it,</v>

1005
00:40:15.821 --> 00:40:16.654
<v Speaker 2>then leave and go do something else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this idea that somehow we're all </v>

1006
00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:20.771
<v Speaker 2>gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1007
00:40:20.771 --> 00:40:21.650
<v Speaker 2>could you imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1008
00:40:21.651 --> 00:40:23.710
<v Speaker 2>a combat gate out there and half of them</v>
<v Speaker 2>decide,</v>

1009
00:40:23.711 --> 00:40:24.131
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1010
00:40:24.131 --> 00:40:26.380
<v Speaker 2>I don't really feel good about this </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular action.</v>

1011
00:40:26.530 --> 00:40:28.750
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe we should stay back it.</v>

1012
00:40:28.810 --> 00:40:31.190
<v Speaker 2>That's not how the world works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I know,</v>

1013
00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:32.450
<v Speaker 2>I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1014
00:40:32.451 --> 00:40:35.200
<v Speaker 2>it'd be great if we all could be better </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

1015
00:40:35.201 --> 00:40:36.034
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

1016
00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:37.120
<v Speaker 3>we're talking to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

1017
00:40:37.121 --> 00:40:39.460
<v Speaker 3>this is coming from a person that has an</v>
<v Speaker 3>experienced combat,</v>

1018
00:40:39.461 --> 00:40:40.294
<v Speaker 3>but we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about a bunch of people </v>

1019
00:40:41.831 --> 00:40:42.664
<v Speaker 3>that really don't understand and really </v>
<v Speaker 3>haven't seen things that you've seen or </v>

1020
00:40:46.151 --> 00:40:48.610
<v Speaker 3>seen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The things that the military is seen and</v>

1021
00:40:48.611 --> 00:40:49.444
<v Speaker 3>they're talking about the world in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of idealized rose colored glasses </v>

1022
00:40:55.150 --> 00:40:59.040
<v Speaker 3>view of things that's not accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so their,</v>

1023
00:40:59.041 --> 00:41:03.340
<v Speaker 3>their version of what America should do </v>
<v Speaker 3>is based on,</v>

1024
00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:07.690
<v Speaker 3>it's based on ignorance in this idea </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we don't need intelligence,</v>

1025
00:41:07.810 --> 00:41:08.643
<v Speaker 3>we don't need a military.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't need a presence in all these </v>

1026
00:41:11.111 --> 00:41:12.600
<v Speaker 3>other countries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1027
00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:14.080
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't,</v>

1028
00:41:14.170 --> 00:41:15.003
<v Speaker 3>I don't buy that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that makes sense when you </v>

1029
00:41:16.661 --> 00:41:19.450
<v Speaker 3>look at all the different conflicts that</v>
<v Speaker 3>are going on in the world.</v>

1030
00:41:19.730 --> 00:41:20.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

1031
00:41:20.370 --> 00:41:21.800
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that there is a,</v>

1032
00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:25.320
<v Speaker 2>there's an element out there that says </v>
<v Speaker 2>if we just take her on as an example,</v>

1033
00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:28.320
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in obs spoken with people who,</v>

1034
00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:32.700
<v Speaker 2>who honestly seemed to believe that in </v>
<v Speaker 2>part because the previous,</v>

1035
00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:34.273
<v Speaker 2>I mean now former secretary carries out </v>
<v Speaker 2>their public aid and abet President </v>

1036
00:41:36.850 --> 00:41:38.570
<v Speaker 2>Obama's out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're all saying,</v>

1037
00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:40.310
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the Iranians have been complying.</v>

1038
00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:41.270
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1039
00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:44.330
<v Speaker 2>they're implying that it's our fault.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's our fault for backing out of this.</v>

1040
00:41:44.331 --> 00:41:45.164
<v Speaker 2>It's our fault that somehow that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Iranians have been cheating on the </v>

1041
00:41:48.231 --> 00:41:49.080
<v Speaker 2>missile sanctions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

1042
00:41:49.230 --> 00:41:49.630
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1043
00:41:49.630 --> 00:41:50.463
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the UN even agreed in it at the end of </v>

1044
00:41:53.691 --> 00:41:56.780
<v Speaker 2>2014 that in just in October of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>year,</v>

1045
00:41:56.781 --> 00:41:57.614
<v Speaker 2>the Iranians had been busting a </v>
<v Speaker 2>agreements related to their ballistic </v>

1046
00:42:00.051 --> 00:42:00.884
<v Speaker 2>missiles and their development.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we signed that agreement a few </v>

1047
00:42:04.610 --> 00:42:05.443
<v Speaker 2>months later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three months later.</v>

1048
00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:06.393
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1049
00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:09.380
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it happens,</v>

1050
00:42:09.381 --> 00:42:11.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no matter what you may want to think.</v>

1051
00:42:11.690 --> 00:42:12.710
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is a,</v>

1052
00:42:12.711 --> 00:42:14.130
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a messy place at the,</v>

1053
00:42:14.131 --> 00:42:14.964
<v Speaker 2>I would love it to be different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would love everybody to get along and </v>

1054
00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:19.340
<v Speaker 2>he would be great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think what we could do if we didn't have</v>

1055
00:42:19.341 --> 00:42:21.620
<v Speaker 2>a defense budget and we can all be on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be happy.</v>

1056
00:42:21.621 --> 00:42:22.031
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be,</v>

1057
00:42:22.031 --> 00:42:24.140
<v Speaker 2>it'd be wonderful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but flowers everywhere.</v>

1058
00:42:24.170 --> 00:42:25.430
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And UNICORNS.</v>

1059
00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:26.533
<v Speaker 2>Well maybe not unicorns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess that physically they're just </v>

1060
00:42:27.701 --> 00:42:29.420
<v Speaker 2>sort of real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can make one now.</v>

1061
00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:32.090
<v Speaker 2>All the money that you don't spend on </v>
<v Speaker 2>war.</v>

1062
00:42:32.530 --> 00:42:33.363
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could probably have one pop out of my </v>

1063
00:42:34.701 --> 00:42:38.720
<v Speaker 2>watch if I knew how to work it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm impressed.</v>

1064
00:42:38.721 --> 00:42:39.554
<v Speaker 2>I know the passcode.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was about to actually do the passcode </v>

1065
00:42:41.271 --> 00:42:42.104
<v Speaker 2>and say it out loud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you ever find yourself doing </v>

1066
00:42:43.101 --> 00:42:43.280
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

1067
00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:44.113
<v Speaker 2>Like when you're typing a number,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was about to do that here when I was </v>

1068
00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:48.680
<v Speaker 2>putting in my passcode anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1069
00:42:48.681 --> 00:42:50.870
<v Speaker 2>people are always going to have an </v>
<v Speaker 2>idealized version of the world,</v>

1070
00:42:50.871 --> 00:42:51.704
<v Speaker 2>especially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially with they own experience it </v>

1071
00:42:52.701 --> 00:42:55.100
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think that,</v>

1072
00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:56.510
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the most part,</v>

1073
00:42:56.570 --> 00:42:59.270
<v Speaker 2>when people think of intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 2>community,</v>

1074
00:42:59.271 --> 00:43:00.104
<v Speaker 2>so thinking about the CIA or the FBI,</v>
<v Speaker 2>generally for whatever reason in </v>

1075
00:43:03.291 --> 00:43:05.060
<v Speaker 2>America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get a negative response.</v>

1076
00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:06.313
<v Speaker 2>People don't think about it in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that's necessary and </v>

1077
00:43:09.141 --> 00:43:09.974
<v Speaker 2>beneficial and really a cornerstone of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the protection of the people in this </v>

1078
00:43:15.621 --> 00:43:17.450
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't think of it that way.</v>

1079
00:43:17.690 --> 00:43:19.520
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's been a tradition.</v>

1080
00:43:19.550 --> 00:43:21.050
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could go back to,</v>

1081
00:43:21.370 --> 00:43:24.260
<v Speaker 2>we'll work to the end of World War II,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1082
00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:25.850
<v Speaker 2>oss,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was the,</v>

1083
00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:29.030
<v Speaker 2>the founding organization that then </v>
<v Speaker 2>became later on the CIA,</v>

1084
00:43:29.150 --> 00:43:31.180
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>amazing people involved in,</v>

1085
00:43:31.181 --> 00:43:33.560
<v Speaker 2>in oss and basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1086
00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:34.800
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1087
00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:37.280
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they did during the war,</v>

1088
00:43:37.281 --> 00:43:37.790
<v Speaker 2>it was incredible.</v>

1089
00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:39.290
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they do this.</v>

1090
00:43:39.291 --> 00:43:42.620
<v Speaker 2>And while Bill Donald Donovan was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>head of Oss.</v>

1091
00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:46.250
<v Speaker 2>So imagine all these dedicated people </v>
<v Speaker 2>dropping in behind enemy lines,</v>

1092
00:43:46.251 --> 00:43:51.251
<v Speaker 2>both in the European and Japanese </v>
<v Speaker 2>theater and engaged in all this activity</v>

1093
00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:55.730
<v Speaker 2>for the years that it took to win that </v>
<v Speaker 2>war.</v>

1094
00:43:56.960 --> 00:44:00.000
<v Speaker 2>And we got out of the war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we finished and I,</v>

1095
00:44:00.001 --> 00:44:01.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm assuming most people listening know </v>
<v Speaker 2>how that ended.</v>

1096
00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:07.310
<v Speaker 2>And Truman literally just kind of writes</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little note to Bill Donovan.</v>

1097
00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:09.460
<v Speaker 2>I've seen the note and it says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1098
00:44:09.570 --> 00:44:10.800
<v Speaker 2>Bill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1099
00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:11.870
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great job,</v>

1100
00:44:11.871 --> 00:44:13.520
<v Speaker 2>thanks so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1101
00:44:13.521 --> 00:44:14.870
<v Speaker 2>wrapping it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1102
00:44:14.871 --> 00:44:18.770
<v Speaker 2>all the best good luck in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they shut down Oss,</v>

1103
00:44:18.890 --> 00:44:20.120
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't need it anymore.</v>

1104
00:44:20.121 --> 00:44:20.954
<v Speaker 2>They didn't need the Intel service </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we won the war and things are </v>

1105
00:44:22.930 --> 00:44:24.920
<v Speaker 2>gunna be looking pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1106
00:44:24.950 --> 00:44:27.290
<v Speaker 2>about a year later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1107
00:44:27.410 --> 00:44:28.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1108
00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:28.983
<v Speaker 2>they got the band back together because </v>
<v Speaker 2>what was happening and the Soviets </v>

1109
00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:32.230
<v Speaker 2>running,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1110
00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:33.413
<v Speaker 2>all over the place and it was the cold </v>
<v Speaker 2>war and the Soviets had no intention of </v>

1111
00:44:37.381 --> 00:44:40.440
<v Speaker 2>being benign and living in a community </v>
<v Speaker 2>of nations.</v>

1112
00:44:40.770 --> 00:44:43.080
<v Speaker 2>And so suddenly they got the band back </v>
<v Speaker 2>and said,</v>

1113
00:44:43.110 --> 00:44:43.561
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1114
00:44:43.561 --> 00:44:45.810
<v Speaker 2>So that's when the CIA was created in </v>
<v Speaker 2>1947,</v>

1115
00:44:46.450 --> 00:44:47.700
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the end of the Cold War,</v>

1116
00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:49.170
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not that long ago.</v>

1117
00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:50.033
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although it seems like ancient history </v>

1118
00:44:51.331 --> 00:44:52.164
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were a lot of serious people in </v>

1119
00:44:53.791 --> 00:44:57.540
<v Speaker 2>Washington dc at when the wall fell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who basically said,</v>

1120
00:44:57.541 --> 00:45:00.000
<v Speaker 2>let's wrap up the age so we don't need </v>
<v Speaker 2>the CIA anymore.</v>

1121
00:45:00.090 --> 00:45:01.740
<v Speaker 2>So there's this pattern of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1122
00:45:01.741 --> 00:45:04.440
<v Speaker 2>people want and that's good back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People want to think the best.</v>

1123
00:45:04.441 --> 00:45:05.370
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a good thing.</v>

1124
00:45:05.371 --> 00:45:06.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Americans tend to be,</v>

1125
00:45:07.290 --> 00:45:11.610
<v Speaker 2>whether it's ideological or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or naive or optimistic,</v>

1126
00:45:11.611 --> 00:45:12.840
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a good thing.</v>

1127
00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:13.910
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it,</v>

1128
00:45:13.911 --> 00:45:14.744
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it butts up against the reality of how </v>

1129
00:45:15.871 --> 00:45:16.800
<v Speaker 2>the world actually works.</v>

1130
00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:18.660
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because in America,</v>

1131
00:45:18.661 --> 00:45:21.240
<v Speaker 3>things are pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1132
00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:22.093
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're about as good as it gets in the </v>

1133
00:45:23.341 --> 00:45:25.960
<v Speaker 3>world when you wander around America for</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

1134
00:45:26.010 --> 00:45:26.843
<v Speaker 3>as a large nation as this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things are pretty God damn good for the </v>

1135
00:45:30.241 --> 00:45:31.074
<v Speaker 3>most part.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1136
00:45:31.170 --> 00:45:33.870
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's part of the problem </v>
<v Speaker 3>is that these people,</v>

1137
00:45:33.871 --> 00:45:37.620
<v Speaker 3>they're not traveling to these war zones</v>
<v Speaker 3>and not experiencing,</v>

1138
00:45:37.770 --> 00:45:38.603
<v Speaker 3>I've talked to so many people that have </v>
<v Speaker 3>been overseas and been to these places </v>

1139
00:45:41.251 --> 00:45:42.084
<v Speaker 3>of conflict and they come out with an a </v>
<v Speaker 3>dark view of what is possible if you're </v>

1140
00:45:47.281 --> 00:45:48.960
<v Speaker 3>in the wrong place on the planet.</v>

1141
00:45:49.020 --> 00:45:49.853
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What people can do to each other is a </v>

1142
00:45:52.220 --> 00:45:54.150
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1143
00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:54.611
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1144
00:45:54.611 --> 00:45:55.970
<v Speaker 2>it can get messy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1145
00:45:56.910 --> 00:45:57.743
<v Speaker 2>but I think there would be value if </v>
<v Speaker 2>somehow we could enact some program </v>

1146
00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:05.213
<v Speaker 2>where everybody had to spend a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 2>years in service of some sort of </v>

1147
00:46:07.381 --> 00:46:10.260
<v Speaker 2>military service or oversee service.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know we had the peace corps and all of</v>

1148
00:46:10.261 --> 00:46:10.980
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1149
00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:11.561
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1150
00:46:11.561 --> 00:46:12.990
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and high school kids say,</v>

1151
00:46:12.991 --> 00:46:13.824
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to Bermuda and I built a house </v>

1152
00:46:14.850 --> 00:46:15.683
<v Speaker 2>for a week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I got my international </v>

1153
00:46:17.431 --> 00:46:19.080
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's better than nothing.</v>

1154
00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:20.400
<v Speaker 2>It's better than nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>

1155
00:46:20.401 --> 00:46:21.234
<v Speaker 2>I think something that would would mean </v>
<v Speaker 2>people would have a little more skin in </v>

1156
00:46:23.131 --> 00:46:24.180
<v Speaker 2>the game and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1157
00:46:24.181 --> 00:46:24.811
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're right.</v>

1158
00:46:24.811 --> 00:46:26.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go to some of these places.</v>

1159
00:46:26.371 --> 00:46:28.770
<v Speaker 2>Fourth and fifth world countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1160
00:46:28.771 --> 00:46:29.940
<v Speaker 2>and you do realize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm an I,</v>

1161
00:46:29.941 --> 00:46:31.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people roll their eyes,</v>

1162
00:46:31.291 --> 00:46:34.710
<v Speaker 2>but I damn it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the best country in the world.</v>

1163
00:46:34.770 --> 00:46:37.140
<v Speaker 2>And I say that repeatedly and I believe </v>
<v Speaker 2>it firmly,</v>

1164
00:46:37.890 --> 00:46:39.750
<v Speaker 2>we make mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no doubt about it.</v>

1165
00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:42.030
<v Speaker 2>But we tend to course correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We try,</v>

1166
00:46:42.031 --> 00:46:44.100
<v Speaker 2>sometimes it takes a little bit longer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1167
00:46:44.370 --> 00:46:46.350
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no matter what administration is there,</v>

1168
00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:50.730
<v Speaker 2>we try to do the right thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when people talk about,</v>

1169
00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:52.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>us just stepping off and,</v>

1170
00:46:52.670 --> 00:46:55.140
<v Speaker 2>and not worrying about our place in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

1171
00:46:56.060 --> 00:46:56.893
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1172
00:46:56.940 --> 00:46:57.773
<v Speaker 2>someone's going to try to take that </v>
<v Speaker 2>position on the ladder and it's not </v>

1173
00:47:00.661 --> 00:47:03.750
<v Speaker 2>going to be as benign as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as we tend to be.</v>

1174
00:47:03.751 --> 00:47:04.590
<v Speaker 2>Not always.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

1175
00:47:04.591 --> 00:47:06.210
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I realize we make mistakes.</v>

1176
00:47:06.211 --> 00:47:06.811
<v Speaker 2>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1177
00:47:06.811 --> 00:47:07.644
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to self flagellate over </v>

1178
00:47:08.291 --> 00:47:09.180
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1179
00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:11.460
<v Speaker 2>still we do a pretty damn good job.</v>

1180
00:47:11.550 --> 00:47:16.550
<v Speaker 3>We tried to be the moral authority of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world or the moral compass at least.</v>

1181
00:47:16.730 --> 00:47:18.930
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the thought process behind it for</v>

1182
00:47:18.931 --> 00:47:19.570
<v Speaker 3>the most part.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1183
00:47:19.570 --> 00:47:20.950
<v Speaker 2>That's the thought process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1184
00:47:20.990 --> 00:47:21.551
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1185
00:47:21.551 --> 00:47:22.271
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes,</v>

1186
00:47:22.271 --> 00:47:23.104
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a human endeavor so it's not going </v>

1187
00:47:24.661 --> 00:47:25.494
<v Speaker 2>to work all the time.</v>

1188
00:47:25.710 --> 00:47:26.543
<v Speaker 3>Don't you think that people are more </v>
<v Speaker 3>open to this idea that it's necessary </v>

1189
00:47:28.711 --> 00:47:32.290
<v Speaker 3>now because of the Russian situation and</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of understanding the,</v>

1190
00:47:32.291 --> 00:47:33.124
<v Speaker 3>the amount of power that Putin wheels </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the way he has just really ultimate </v>

1191
00:47:36.641 --> 00:47:39.610
<v Speaker 3>control over that part of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he really does.</v>

1192
00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:40.653
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could drone on all you want about </v>

1193
00:47:42.881 --> 00:47:45.400
<v Speaker 3>democratic elections,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we all know that's horse shit.</v>

1194
00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:47.800
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he fucking kills anybody over there.</v>

1195
00:47:47.801 --> 00:47:50.110
<v Speaker 3>That's a legitimate threat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kills anybody over there.</v>

1196
00:47:50.340 --> 00:47:51.840
<v Speaker 2>Journalists over there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1197
00:47:51.841 --> 00:47:52.321
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just,</v>

1198
00:47:52.321 --> 00:47:54.550
<v Speaker 2>they tried to scribble and his daughter </v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll,</v>

1199
00:47:54.551 --> 00:47:55.120
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was,</v>

1200
00:47:55.120 --> 00:47:57.220
<v Speaker 2>she was collateral damage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

1201
00:47:57.310 --> 00:47:59.130
<v Speaker 2>put some shit on a door knob.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1202
00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:00.273
<v Speaker 2>they touched with their hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I nerve agent them and put them in the </v>

1203
00:48:03.211 --> 00:48:04.044
<v Speaker 2>hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And who knows if they're even going to </v>

1204
00:48:04.890 --> 00:48:05.850
<v Speaker 2>recover from that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1205
00:48:05.851 --> 00:48:06.451
<v Speaker 2>think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's,</v>

1206
00:48:06.451 --> 00:48:07.860
<v Speaker 2>she's out of the hospital now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's doing good.</v>

1207
00:48:07.861 --> 00:48:09.270
<v Speaker 2>He's doing a little bit better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1208
00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:10.193
<v Speaker 2>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think about what that entails as an </v>

1209
00:48:10.831 --> 00:48:11.571
<v Speaker 2>operation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1210
00:48:11.571 --> 00:48:12.111
<v Speaker 2>Not that they haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1211
00:48:12.111 --> 00:48:13.140
<v Speaker 2>they've been doing this since they </v>
<v Speaker 2>killed,</v>

1212
00:48:13.170 --> 00:48:14.580
<v Speaker 2>what's his name?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trotsky in Mexico.</v>

1213
00:48:14.610 --> 00:48:15.330
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they,</v>

1214
00:48:15.330 --> 00:48:17.540
<v Speaker 2>this is what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah.</v>

1215
00:48:17.550 --> 00:48:20.400
<v Speaker 2>Markov liftfund ankle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alexander Olympia and ankle,</v>

1216
00:48:20.430 --> 00:48:23.700
<v Speaker 2>they killed him with a polonium and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>was just a handful of years ago.</v>

1217
00:48:23.820 --> 00:48:26.430
<v Speaker 2>So they go after Sergei,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's living in a small,</v>

1218
00:48:26.460 --> 00:48:28.350
<v Speaker 2>relatively small quiet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1219
00:48:28.351 --> 00:48:30.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm British town,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Salisbury.</v>

1220
00:48:30.450 --> 00:48:33.210
<v Speaker 2>And so that requires him to surveil </v>
<v Speaker 2>Sergei.</v>

1221
00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:33.990
<v Speaker 2>They got to get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1222
00:48:33.990 --> 00:48:36.000
<v Speaker 2>cause you always had to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You gotta do some operation like this.</v>

1223
00:48:36.001 --> 00:48:37.040
<v Speaker 2>You gotta know what you're getting into </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1224
00:48:37.041 --> 00:48:38.460
<v Speaker 2>You got to figure out how you're going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do it.</v>

1225
00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:40.950
<v Speaker 2>And so there's a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to front load all that work.</v>

1226
00:48:40.951 --> 00:48:41.784
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they're doing all this </v>

1227
00:48:42.241 --> 00:48:43.074
<v Speaker 2>surveillance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're figuring out what their </v>

1228
00:48:43.740 --> 00:48:46.030
<v Speaker 2>operational game plan's going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1229
00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:50.310
<v Speaker 2>this is in the UK and their whole point </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the exercise is to teach other people</v>

1230
00:48:50.730 --> 00:48:52.770
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't betray us.</v>

1231
00:48:52.790 --> 00:48:53.800
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1232
00:48:53.810 --> 00:48:54.643
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1233
00:48:54.750 --> 00:48:55.860
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1234
00:48:55.861 --> 00:48:57.090
<v Speaker 2>then they put this on a door,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

1235
00:48:57.091 --> 00:48:58.620
<v Speaker 2>they didn't care who else touch said </v>
<v Speaker 2>Nah,</v>

1236
00:48:58.621 --> 00:49:00.510
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't like they could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they could guarantee that,</v>

1237
00:49:00.511 --> 00:49:01.344
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the postman and a variety of visitors </v>

1238
00:49:02.341 --> 00:49:04.680
<v Speaker 2>weren't going to come through the door.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they really,</v>

1239
00:49:04.681 --> 00:49:06.300
<v Speaker 2>they really don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1240
00:49:06.750 --> 00:49:07.620
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he is,</v>

1241
00:49:07.670 --> 00:49:09.600
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he is definitely,</v>

1242
00:49:09.601 --> 00:49:11.730
<v Speaker 2>he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's an old school kgb,</v>

1243
00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:13.640
<v Speaker 2>very easy cat to understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1244
00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:15.760
<v Speaker 2>and we've always kind of acted like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1245
00:49:15.890 --> 00:49:18.330
<v Speaker 2>we don't get it or somehow he's going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>change his stripes.</v>

1246
00:49:18.331 --> 00:49:19.164
<v Speaker 2>He's never going to change his stripes </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's going to always act in what he </v>

1247
00:49:21.541 --> 00:49:24.060
<v Speaker 2>believes to be the best interest of what</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would like to believe.</v>

1248
00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:27.750
<v Speaker 2>Is that still the former Soviet Union </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Gary</v>

1249
00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:30.680
<v Speaker 3>far off was talking about him and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

1250
00:49:30.730 --> 00:49:31.563
<v Speaker 3>he's a vocal critic of Putin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he was saying that if you look into </v>

1251
00:49:34.661 --> 00:49:39.661
<v Speaker 3>all the different companies that they've</v>
<v Speaker 3>confiscated and acquired,</v>

1252
00:49:39.701 --> 00:49:41.710
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>th th th this what they do,</v>

1253
00:49:41.711 --> 00:49:42.544
<v Speaker 3>like if they have a political enemy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they essentially just take over their </v>

1254
00:49:45.521 --> 00:49:48.190
<v Speaker 3>company and charge them with some sort </v>
<v Speaker 3>of a crime and throw him in jail.</v>

1255
00:49:48.191 --> 00:49:49.010
<v Speaker 3>And they do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they do this too.</v>

1256
00:49:49.010 --> 00:49:49.843
<v Speaker 3>Billionaires,</v>

1257
00:49:49.850 --> 00:49:53.330
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kowski he spent years in jail and um,</v>

1258
00:49:53.610 --> 00:49:55.100
<v Speaker 2>and his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his mistake was,</v>

1259
00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:56.313
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his mistake was he started getting </v>

1260
00:49:58.431 --> 00:49:59.264
<v Speaker 2>political aspirations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the deal has always been with </v>

1261
00:50:01.671 --> 00:50:04.970
<v Speaker 2>Putin as far as the oligarchs concern.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You keep your nose in business,</v>

1262
00:50:05.030 --> 00:50:06.800
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You focus on your business,</v>

1263
00:50:06.970 --> 00:50:07.803
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be a cut going towards </v>

1264
00:50:08.451 --> 00:50:09.880
<v Speaker 2>the government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1265
00:50:10.310 --> 00:50:14.540
<v Speaker 2>and you're good because it furthers my </v>
<v Speaker 2>agenda.</v>

1266
00:50:14.780 --> 00:50:17.190
<v Speaker 2>Right now you're building up these </v>
<v Speaker 2>businesses and you know,</v>

1267
00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:22.200
<v Speaker 2>we're making some money on the side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as soon as any of them start to veer</v>

1268
00:50:22.221 --> 00:50:25.010
<v Speaker 2>off that path and maybe get some </v>
<v Speaker 2>political aspiration,</v>

1269
00:50:25.190 --> 00:50:26.570
<v Speaker 2>then it's done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

1270
00:50:26.571 --> 00:50:27.980
<v Speaker 2>and that's when turns on them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1271
00:50:27.981 --> 00:50:29.360
<v Speaker 2>and he's been very effective at doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1272
00:50:29.540 --> 00:50:30.373
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean terrifyingly so it does it open </v>

1273
00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:32.990
<v Speaker 2>publicly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1274
00:50:33.220 --> 00:50:34.053
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it gets,</v>

1275
00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:35.033
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we look at it from a different </v>

1276
00:50:36.501 --> 00:50:36.950
<v Speaker 2>perspective.</v>

1277
00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:39.950
<v Speaker 2>We look at it go like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how could people with a straight face,</v>

1278
00:50:39.951 --> 00:50:42.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stand by while he gets a fourth term and</v>

1279
00:50:42.381 --> 00:50:43.200
<v Speaker 2>he's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1280
00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:44.430
<v Speaker 2>president for life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1281
00:50:44.450 --> 00:50:45.500
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look over China.</v>

1282
00:50:45.890 --> 00:50:48.560
<v Speaker 2>She has spent the past few years locking</v>
<v Speaker 2>that down,</v>

1283
00:50:48.660 --> 00:50:50.900
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Building up the security apparatus.</v>

1284
00:50:51.330 --> 00:50:52.360
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1285
00:50:52.390 --> 00:50:54.890
<v Speaker 2>kind of stepping on this idea that </v>
<v Speaker 2>somehow there's a rule of law.</v>

1286
00:50:55.330 --> 00:50:57.380
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's now built back up this,</v>

1287
00:50:57.381 --> 00:50:58.214
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this a cult of personality that we </v>

1288
00:51:00.171 --> 00:51:01.004
<v Speaker 2>haven't really seen since Shell Ping or </v>
<v Speaker 2>are certainly Mau and he's there for </v>

1289
00:51:05.091 --> 00:51:05.924
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that gives them a strategic </v>

1290
00:51:07.521 --> 00:51:08.121
<v Speaker 2>advantage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1291
00:51:08.121 --> 00:51:10.250
<v Speaker 2>Because they can look at problems in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>long haul.</v>

1292
00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:12.950
<v Speaker 2>Whereas here we're looking at it in an </v>
<v Speaker 2>election cycle.</v>

1293
00:51:13.370 --> 00:51:17.030
<v Speaker 2>So when we've got a major issue to deal </v>
<v Speaker 2>with with China,</v>

1294
00:51:17.310 --> 00:51:19.040
<v Speaker 2>she's not looking at it and thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1295
00:51:19.041 --> 00:51:21.400
<v Speaker 2>well yeah I got to sort this out in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>next short period of time.</v>

1296
00:51:21.430 --> 00:51:23.770
<v Speaker 2>He's looking at it and thinking trump's </v>
<v Speaker 2>got maybe two years left.</v>

1297
00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:24.620
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1298
00:51:24.620 --> 00:51:26.630
<v Speaker 2>Maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe he gets reelected,</v>

1299
00:51:26.631 --> 00:51:27.770
<v Speaker 2>maybe he doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1300
00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:29.910
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's how he,</v>

1301
00:51:30.350 --> 00:51:31.183
<v Speaker 2>that's how he's processing this and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be a transitionary time in </v>

1302
00:51:33.261 --> 00:51:34.094
<v Speaker 2>between the two candidates or the two </v>
<v Speaker 2>presidents where things get real sloppy </v>

1303
00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:39.650
<v Speaker 2>and they might be able to slip in </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

1304
00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:41.200
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you talk about that.</v>

1305
00:51:41.260 --> 00:51:42.950
<v Speaker 2>I mean the Chinese really do play the </v>
<v Speaker 2>long game,</v>

1306
00:51:43.220 --> 00:51:44.630
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They really play the long game.</v>

1307
00:51:44.631 --> 00:51:46.850
<v Speaker 2>They'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll put a,</v>

1308
00:51:46.851 --> 00:51:50.150
<v Speaker 2>an asset here in the country to go to </v>
<v Speaker 2>school.</v>

1309
00:51:50.780 --> 00:51:52.360
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they'll,</v>

1310
00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:53.233
<v Speaker 2>their only job is to get excellent </v>
<v Speaker 2>grades and then they'll go to grad </v>

1311
00:51:55.401 --> 00:51:58.820
<v Speaker 2>school and they'll get excellent grades </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they'll go get a job somewhere.</v>

1312
00:51:58.850 --> 00:52:01.490
<v Speaker 2>And it doesn't really matter necessarily</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they get a job,</v>

1313
00:52:01.730 --> 00:52:02.563
<v Speaker 2>but they'll get a job and then they'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>get another job and eventually they are </v>

1314
00:52:04.071 --> 00:52:04.904
<v Speaker 2>working at a raytheon or they're working</v>
<v Speaker 2>at corning or they're working at some </v>

1315
00:52:06.831 --> 00:52:09.060
<v Speaker 2>company that's got some relevance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1316
00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:11.000
<v Speaker 2>from their perspective in terms of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>they do.</v>

1317
00:52:11.420 --> 00:52:14.090
<v Speaker 2>And that's a 25,</v>
<v Speaker 2>30 year commitment.</v>

1318
00:52:14.330 --> 00:52:14.831
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they,</v>

1319
00:52:14.831 --> 00:52:17.120
<v Speaker 2>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do that all the time.</v>

1320
00:52:17.390 --> 00:52:18.223
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we tend to look at things in a shorter </v>

1321
00:52:20.620 --> 00:52:21.760
<v Speaker 2>timeframe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1322
00:52:21.770 --> 00:52:23.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even from an Intel service,</v>

1323
00:52:24.190 --> 00:52:25.023
<v Speaker 2>we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our officers will get out there and </v>

1324
00:52:25.941 --> 00:52:26.451
<v Speaker 2>they'll think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1325
00:52:26.451 --> 00:52:28.010
<v Speaker 2>we've got to make some recruitment's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1326
00:52:28.011 --> 00:52:28.844
<v Speaker 2>and I got maybe two years here and on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ground and it's that sort of </v>

1327
00:52:31.641 --> 00:52:34.220
<v Speaker 2>deployment or that sort of tour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1328
00:52:34.250 --> 00:52:38.330
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not that 30 year commitment because</v>

1329
00:52:38.390 --> 00:52:39.223
<v Speaker 2>if I'm the officer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting promoted based on how many </v>

1330
00:52:41.271 --> 00:52:42.104
<v Speaker 2>recruitments I get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not getting necessarily promoted </v>

1331
00:52:43.521 --> 00:52:46.730
<v Speaker 2>based on how well I handle assets that </v>
<v Speaker 2>have already been promoted.</v>

1332
00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:50.850
<v Speaker 2>And that was a critic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the plot of the young American,</v>

1333
00:52:51.050 --> 00:52:52.510
<v Speaker 2>the American's show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1334
00:52:52.730 --> 00:52:53.563
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the show about Russian spies who </v>

1335
00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:59.720
<v Speaker 2>pretended to be just normal American </v>
<v Speaker 2>citizens moved in,</v>

1336
00:52:59.721 --> 00:53:01.880
<v Speaker 2>did the whole thing talk with the normal</v>
<v Speaker 2>accent.</v>

1337
00:53:02.540 --> 00:53:03.373
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That came out of that New Jersey </v>

1338
00:53:04.550 --> 00:53:07.340
<v Speaker 2>incident with Anna Chapman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was those,</v>

1339
00:53:07.341 --> 00:53:09.650
<v Speaker 2>those individuals were just basically </v>
<v Speaker 2>there to exist.</v>

1340
00:53:09.651 --> 00:53:10.484
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their whole point of of being was just </v>

1341
00:53:11.571 --> 00:53:12.404
<v Speaker 2>to see whether they bump into somebody </v>
<v Speaker 2>of interest and they wouldn't going to </v>

1342
00:53:14.351 --> 00:53:16.670
<v Speaker 2>be responsible for them developing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>potential target.</v>

1343
00:53:16.910 --> 00:53:17.743
<v Speaker 2>That would be somebody else's </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibility and that person who was </v>

1344
00:53:19.971 --> 00:53:21.530
<v Speaker 2>had the responsibility to develop that </v>
<v Speaker 2>target,</v>

1345
00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:22.573
<v Speaker 2>it wouldn't be their responsibility to </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe task them or make some sort light </v>

1346
00:53:25.381 --> 00:53:27.690
<v Speaker 2>pitch that would be somebody else's </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibility.</v>

1347
00:53:27.691 --> 00:53:28.524
<v Speaker 2>So there's people up that food chain </v>
<v Speaker 2>that take on more and more </v>

1348
00:53:31.021 --> 00:53:33.350
<v Speaker 2>responsibility if they find happened to </v>
<v Speaker 2>find the targets of interest.</v>

1349
00:53:33.351 --> 00:53:35.570
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's just the resources devoted to</v>

1350
00:53:35.610 --> 00:53:38.190
<v Speaker 2>one part of the country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a cautious,</v>

1351
00:53:38.191 --> 00:53:40.830
<v Speaker 2>well thought out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>long term plan.</v>

1352
00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:41.881
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

1353
00:53:41.881 --> 00:53:42.810
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

1354
00:53:43.050 --> 00:53:45.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean sometimes the Russians are just </v>
<v Speaker 2>as like a shotgun approach,</v>

1355
00:53:45.121 --> 00:53:45.300
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1356
00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:47.310
<v Speaker 2>They'll pitch everybody and see what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens right there.</v>

1357
00:53:47.311 --> 00:53:48.144
<v Speaker 2>They're not quite as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a patient and as long term as the </v>

1358
00:53:50.701 --> 00:53:52.360
<v Speaker 2>Chinese are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1359
00:53:52.600 --> 00:53:53.433
<v Speaker 2>we've caught,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1360
00:53:53.490 --> 00:53:55.650
<v Speaker 2>Chinese spies doing this as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1361
00:53:55.651 --> 00:53:56.101
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1362
00:53:56.101 --> 00:53:57.110
<v Speaker 2>We just bagged one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1363
00:53:57.120 --> 00:54:01.240
<v Speaker 2>who was working on behalf of the Chinese</v>
<v Speaker 2>government against the interests of the,</v>

1364
00:54:01.241 --> 00:54:02.940
<v Speaker 2>of the agency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How long ago was this?</v>

1365
00:54:02.941 --> 00:54:04.190
<v Speaker 2>And it's just passed a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1366
00:54:04.191 --> 00:54:06.250
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's become public over the past weekend</v>

1367
00:54:06.330 --> 00:54:09.750
<v Speaker 2>in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's been bubbling away for a while.</v>

1368
00:54:09.780 --> 00:54:11.580
<v Speaker 2>What's this dude's name?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1369
00:54:11.660 --> 00:54:12.660
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1370
00:54:12.661 --> 00:54:15.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to leave it at that only </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's know,</v>

1371
00:54:15.660 --> 00:54:20.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure if I've seen it in print,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a Chinese American and,</v>

1372
00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:22.290
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1373
00:54:22.291 --> 00:54:26.100
<v Speaker 2>obviously part of the attraction for </v>
<v Speaker 2>bringing that person into the agency was</v>

1374
00:54:26.101 --> 00:54:27.500
<v Speaker 2>there Chinese language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

1375
00:54:27.501 --> 00:54:28.171
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1376
00:54:28.171 --> 00:54:29.004
<v Speaker 2>part of the attraction from the Chinese </v>
<v Speaker 2>Intel perspective is the Chinese ethnic </v>

1377
00:54:32.701 --> 00:54:34.410
<v Speaker 2>background,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first generation,</v>

1378
00:54:34.411 --> 00:54:35.580
<v Speaker 2>second generation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>third generation,</v>

1379
00:54:35.581 --> 00:54:36.150
<v Speaker 2>doesn't matter.</v>

1380
00:54:36.150 --> 00:54:40.020
<v Speaker 2>They tend to play off that very well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>

1381
00:54:40.590 --> 00:54:43.890
<v Speaker 2>this individual worked for the agency </v>
<v Speaker 2>for a period of time,</v>

1382
00:54:44.310 --> 00:54:46.410
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then left and then,</v>

1383
00:54:46.470 --> 00:54:48.270
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>set up shop overseas.</v>

1384
00:54:48.630 --> 00:54:52.530
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then his actions became suspect.</v>

1385
00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:54.500
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so that's,</v>

1386
00:54:54.530 --> 00:54:57.110
<v Speaker 2>that's when we ended up getting him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

1387
00:54:57.410 --> 00:54:58.980
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that happens.</v>

1388
00:54:58.981 --> 00:55:01.650
<v Speaker 2>And when you catch somebody who's been </v>
<v Speaker 2>engaged in that first thought is,</v>

1389
00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:03.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank God we caught them.</v>

1390
00:55:03.480 --> 00:55:05.470
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the second is how,</v>

1391
00:55:05.471 --> 00:55:06.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how does someone,</v>

1392
00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:10.320
<v Speaker 2>how does someone do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How does somebody now I say that again,</v>

1393
00:55:10.321 --> 00:55:12.900
<v Speaker 2>not to be self righteous because we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>always out there looking for targets,</v>

1394
00:55:12.930 --> 00:55:13.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to recruit,</v>

1395
00:55:14.010 --> 00:55:15.900
<v Speaker 2>to turn on their country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1396
00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:17.513
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we could find ourselves in Iranian </v>

1397
00:55:18.151 --> 00:55:19.950
<v Speaker 2>scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like we would be coy and say,</v>

1398
00:55:19.951 --> 00:55:20.784
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't want to put them in under that </v>

1399
00:55:21.721 --> 00:55:22.830
<v Speaker 2>stress of recruiting them.</v>

1400
00:55:22.830 --> 00:55:24.720
<v Speaker 2>Of course we do for national security </v>
<v Speaker 2>interests.</v>

1401
00:55:24.721 --> 00:55:26.940
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just from a psychological perspective,</v>

1402
00:55:26.941 --> 00:55:27.270
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1403
00:55:27.270 --> 00:55:28.350
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think about that,</v>

1404
00:55:28.380 --> 00:55:29.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in terms of our ideas,</v>

1405
00:55:29.791 --> 00:55:33.280
<v Speaker 2>that we're doing that stuff for good and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're doing that stuff for bag,</v>

1406
00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:35.640
<v Speaker 2>which is very convenient that we think </v>
<v Speaker 2>that way,</v>

1407
00:55:36.420 --> 00:55:37.253
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1408
00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:38.000
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>

1409
00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:38.481
<v Speaker 2>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1410
00:55:38.481 --> 00:55:38.851
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1411
00:55:38.851 --> 00:55:39.770
<v Speaker 2>you're absolutely right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1412
00:55:39.771 --> 00:55:40.640
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1413
00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:43.020
<v Speaker 2>I understand they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people out there who say,</v>

1414
00:55:43.021 --> 00:55:43.561
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1415
00:55:43.561 --> 00:55:45.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't make that equivalent.</v>

1416
00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:47.550
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I had never had any problem.</v>

1417
00:55:48.030 --> 00:55:50.370
<v Speaker 2>I never had any problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1418
00:55:50.371 --> 00:55:52.170
<v Speaker 2>determining the good people from the bad</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1419
00:55:52.410 --> 00:55:54.420
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's like today,</v>

1420
00:55:54.421 --> 00:55:55.940
<v Speaker 2>one of the senators in the confirmation </v>
<v Speaker 2>hearing,</v>

1421
00:55:55.950 --> 00:55:58.110
<v Speaker 2>and he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry to keep going back to the CIA,</v>

1422
00:55:58.111 --> 00:56:00.750
<v Speaker 2>does a director designate confirmation </v>
<v Speaker 2>hearings up on the hill.</v>

1423
00:56:00.751 --> 00:56:01.800
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1424
00:56:01.830 --> 00:56:02.663
<v Speaker 2>one of the senators,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it almost sound like he was trying to </v>

1425
00:56:04.201 --> 00:56:09.030
<v Speaker 2>make some moral equivalency between </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrorists and agency officers who were,</v>

1426
00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:11.160
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing what they were,</v>

1427
00:56:11.180 --> 00:56:12.013
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>allowed to do underneath the laws of </v>

1428
00:56:13.501 --> 00:56:14.100
<v Speaker 2>that time.</v>

1429
00:56:14.100 --> 00:56:16.680
<v Speaker 2>And the Doj Department of Justice </v>
<v Speaker 2>regulations,</v>

1430
00:56:16.950 --> 00:56:18.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and legal readings.</v>

1431
00:56:18.840 --> 00:56:20.460
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1432
00:56:20.580 --> 00:56:21.540
<v Speaker 2>and his point was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1433
00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:22.553
<v Speaker 2>if you a somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well then what happens if one of your </v>

1434
00:56:25.781 --> 00:56:26.614
<v Speaker 2>people got picked up by terrorists and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were waterboarded would you think </v>

1435
00:56:29.801 --> 00:56:32.050
<v Speaker 2>that that was justified?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm thinking,</v>

1436
00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:32.560
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

1437
00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:34.990
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a very odd construct.</v>

1438
00:56:34.991 --> 00:56:39.560
<v Speaker 2>Or if we're for a question and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think frankly if isis or al Qaeda or,</v>

1439
00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:43.000
<v Speaker 2>or Boko Haram picked up one of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>people and all they did would waterboard</v>

1440
00:56:43.001 --> 00:56:43.541
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1441
00:56:43.541 --> 00:56:45.190
<v Speaker 2>that would be a happy day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1442
00:56:45.191 --> 00:56:47.230
<v Speaker 2>Because they don't operate under any </v>
<v Speaker 2>laws,</v>

1443
00:56:47.350 --> 00:56:49.210
<v Speaker 2>which is what you need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A hospital said she handled the question</v>

1444
00:56:49.211 --> 00:56:52.240
<v Speaker 2>very well and kind of shut it down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1445
00:56:52.780 --> 00:56:55.780
<v Speaker 2>but this idea that sometimes you'll bump</v>
<v Speaker 2>into that where people,</v>

1446
00:56:56.590 --> 00:56:59.110
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it the,</v>

1447
00:57:00.070 --> 00:57:00.970
<v Speaker 2>they're apologists</v>

1448
00:57:01.790 --> 00:57:04.700
<v Speaker 3>act as if we're the bad guys and anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1449
00:57:04.850 --> 00:57:05.690
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What am I to know?</v>

1450
00:57:05.691 --> 00:57:06.890
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1451
00:57:06.950 --> 00:57:08.090
<v Speaker 3>I was about to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do I know?</v>

1452
00:57:09.090 --> 00:57:10.520
<v Speaker 3>Dammit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He pulled away from it.</v>

1453
00:57:11.390 --> 00:57:12.223
<v Speaker 3>But that is exactly what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's apologist and they're </v>

1454
00:57:15.590 --> 00:57:16.423
<v Speaker 3>also trying to frame a narrative instead</v>
<v Speaker 3>of trying to understand the situation </v>

1455
00:57:19.731 --> 00:57:22.790
<v Speaker 3>objectively,</v>
<v Speaker 3>instead of really asking someone who was</v>

1456
00:57:22.791 --> 00:57:23.624
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>asking a bunch of people who were there </v>

1457
00:57:24.651 --> 00:57:29.060
<v Speaker 3>getting a sense of what was the climate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was going on,</v>

1458
00:57:29.090 --> 00:57:32.480
<v Speaker 3>what actually happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Instead they're trying to frame it in it</v>

1459
00:57:32.500 --> 00:57:33.333
<v Speaker 3>like wouldn't it be justified if someone</v>
<v Speaker 3>got hold of one of our troops and did </v>

1460
00:57:36.321 --> 00:57:37.730
<v Speaker 3>that to them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would that be justified?</v>

1461
00:57:37.910 --> 00:57:39.650
<v Speaker 3>There's scoring Brownie points.</v>

1462
00:57:39.810 --> 00:57:40.561
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1463
00:57:40.561 --> 00:57:41.400
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's true.</v>

1464
00:57:41.401 --> 00:57:42.234
<v Speaker 2>I think there's so little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's obviously much worse right now </v>

1465
00:57:44.341 --> 00:57:45.630
<v Speaker 2>with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the current administration,</v>

1466
00:57:45.631 --> 00:57:49.420
<v Speaker 2>the president trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just seems like nobody,</v>

1467
00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:51.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like World War One,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1468
00:57:51.451 --> 00:57:53.190
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's in their trenches throwing </v>
<v Speaker 2>hand grenades,</v>

1469
00:57:53.191 --> 00:57:55.080
<v Speaker 2>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's in the middle ground.</v>

1470
00:57:55.110 --> 00:57:57.300
<v Speaker 2>Nobody is even trying to get up and go </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the middle crown.</v>

1471
00:57:57.690 --> 00:58:00.180
<v Speaker 2>And so nobody's having those </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversations like you said,</v>

1472
00:58:00.181 --> 00:58:00.960
<v Speaker 2>where they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1473
00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:01.793
<v Speaker 2>they even make a lame attempt to try to </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand what the other perspective </v>

1474
00:58:05.431 --> 00:58:08.760
<v Speaker 2>might be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in particular,</v>

1475
00:58:09.990 --> 00:58:13.980
<v Speaker 2>it's exhausting in the sense that not </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything that this administration,</v>

1476
00:58:13.981 --> 00:58:14.814
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1477
00:58:14.820 --> 00:58:16.440
<v Speaker 2>the caveat being I didn't vote for </v>
<v Speaker 2>trump,</v>

1478
00:58:16.500 --> 00:58:17.970
<v Speaker 2>I didn't vote for Clinton.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1479
00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:18.833
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got 320 million people in this </v>

1480
00:58:20.641 --> 00:58:21.474
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think we could've come up with two </v>

1481
00:58:22.321 --> 00:58:24.000
<v Speaker 2>other candidates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1482
00:58:24.050 --> 00:58:25.470
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who did you vote for?</v>

1483
00:58:25.770 --> 00:58:26.730
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

1484
00:58:26.731 --> 00:58:28.980
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this sounds really lame,</v>

1485
00:58:28.981 --> 00:58:33.360
<v Speaker 2>but I just sat it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't get myself to go vote for,</v>

1486
00:58:33.390 --> 00:58:34.430
<v Speaker 2>I just thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1487
00:58:34.500 --> 00:58:37.860
<v Speaker 2>I was gonna vote for Ronald Reagan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his ashes or something,</v>

1488
00:58:37.861 --> 00:58:40.620
<v Speaker 2>but I figured I'd be the only person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1489
00:58:40.650 --> 00:58:42.240
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't,</v>

1490
00:58:42.241 --> 00:58:43.140
<v Speaker 2>I didn't vote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't,</v>

1491
00:58:43.141 --> 00:58:45.870
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't figure out how we got to that</v>
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>

1492
00:58:46.330 --> 00:58:48.020
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and yeah,</v>

1493
00:58:48.030 --> 00:58:50.430
<v Speaker 2>the one person who should really be </v>
<v Speaker 2>pissed off was Bernie Sanders.</v>

1494
00:58:50.431 --> 00:58:51.264
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only collusion we've really proven </v>

1495
00:58:52.021 --> 00:58:52.854
<v Speaker 2>up to this point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a DNC colluding to keep Bernie </v>

1496
00:58:54.991 --> 00:58:55.340
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1497
00:58:55.340 --> 00:58:58.100
<v Speaker 3>And people sweep that under the rug so </v>
<v Speaker 3>quick.</v>

1498
00:58:58.250 --> 00:58:59.083
<v Speaker 3>It's so adorable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's adorable how people just make it </v>

1499
00:59:03.081 --> 00:59:04.520
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not a big deal.</v>

1500
00:59:05.270 --> 00:59:08.480
<v Speaker 3>The deleting of 30,000 emails,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not a big deal.</v>

1501
00:59:08.950 --> 00:59:13.670
<v Speaker 3>The collusion with the DNC to rig the </v>
<v Speaker 3>primary's not a big deal.</v>

1502
00:59:14.180 --> 00:59:14.841
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Bernie,</v>

1503
00:59:14.841 --> 00:59:17.010
<v Speaker 3>God bless him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he played the good soldier and you know,</v>

1504
00:59:17.060 --> 00:59:18.900
<v Speaker 3>fell on the sword and hasn't really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1505
00:59:18.950 --> 00:59:20.990
<v Speaker 3>he hasn't made much of an issue of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's,</v>

1506
00:59:21.320 --> 00:59:22.430
<v Speaker 3>he has aspirations</v>

1507
00:59:22.430 --> 00:59:23.263
<v Speaker 1>to move forward and the knows they owe </v>
<v Speaker 1>him one now and he knows that Hillary </v>

1508
00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:27.500
<v Speaker 1>Clinton is essentially done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

1509
00:59:27.860 --> 00:59:32.180
<v Speaker 1>If they try to bring her back in 2020 </v>
<v Speaker 1>people go fucking crazy.</v>

1510
00:59:32.630 --> 00:59:33.041
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1511
00:59:33.041 --> 00:59:33.874
<v Speaker 1>you really got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You imagine she might have actually be </v>

1512
00:59:36.351 --> 00:59:37.131
<v Speaker 1>thinking that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1513
00:59:37.131 --> 00:59:38.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure she was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1514
00:59:38.450 --> 00:59:39.283
<v Speaker 1>they've probably got an or on a vitamin </v>
<v Speaker 1>IV drip right now and given her hormone </v>

1515
00:59:42.351 --> 00:59:45.530
<v Speaker 1>replacement therapy and I started to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>yoga.</v>

1516
00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:47.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't think she'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1517
00:59:47.030 --> 00:59:50.510
<v Speaker 1>I just don't see her being resurrected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But maybe we'll try.</v>

1518
00:59:50.540 --> 00:59:51.690
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I tell you,</v>

1519
00:59:51.691 --> 00:59:53.900
<v Speaker 1>I do think Joe Biden is coming in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think so?</v>

1520
00:59:53.930 --> 00:59:55.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's viewing this.</v>

1521
00:59:55.731 --> 00:59:58.760
<v Speaker 1>I think he's very upset with himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not upset with others,</v>

1522
00:59:58.761 --> 00:59:59.594
<v Speaker 1>but I think he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he probably thinks at this stage of the </v>

1523
01:00:01.161 --> 01:00:02.420
<v Speaker 1>game and times were different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was tough.</v>

1524
01:00:02.421 --> 01:00:03.254
<v Speaker 1>We didn't regarding his family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think he probably regrets not </v>

1525
01:00:05.181 --> 01:00:06.260
<v Speaker 1>going in the last time.</v>

1526
01:00:06.670 --> 01:00:07.503
<v Speaker 1>And I think we're going to see him throw</v>
<v Speaker 1>his hat in the ring because he's going </v>

1527
01:00:09.491 --> 01:00:11.450
<v Speaker 1>to look around and he's going to think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what am I up against?</v>

1528
01:00:11.451 --> 01:00:14.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm up against a Harris and booker and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know who else?</v>

1529
01:00:14.721 --> 01:00:17.270
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's got some baggage though.</v>

1530
01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:19.970
<v Speaker 1>People forget about when I was in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Boston,</v>

1531
01:00:19.971 --> 01:00:20.804
<v Speaker 1>we used to have Joe Biden tonight at </v>
<v Speaker 1>stitches comedy club where we would </v>

1532
01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:27.620
<v Speaker 1>plagiarize each other's jokes because </v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe Biden,</v>

1533
01:00:27.650 --> 01:00:28.483
<v Speaker 1>people don't remember this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the 1980s he got busted </v>

1534
01:00:30.321 --> 01:00:33.520
<v Speaker 1>plagiarizing Kennedy's speeches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People forgot about that.</v>

1535
01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:35.760
<v Speaker 1>He ran for president in [inaudible] 88.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1536
01:00:36.010 --> 01:00:37.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a good point.</v>

1537
01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:38.033
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody loves the guy that's sitting </v>

1538
01:00:38.931 --> 01:00:39.764
<v Speaker 1>on the bench,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1539
01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:42.080
<v Speaker 1>So there were a lot of Democrats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think after the fact that we think,</v>

1540
01:00:42.081 --> 01:00:43.850
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if joe had just run,</v>

1541
01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:46.130
<v Speaker 1>but he's run a couple of times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it hasn't worked out.</v>

1542
01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:48.450
<v Speaker 1>And so I'll put the chewed him up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1543
01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:50.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's real.</v>

1544
01:00:50.940 --> 01:00:52.010
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I,</v>

1545
01:00:52.011 --> 01:00:53.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>

1546
01:00:53.570 --> 01:00:54.540
<v Speaker 1>but what I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1547
01:00:54.550 --> 01:00:57.320
<v Speaker 1>it's the politics of it all or are </v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating,</v>

1548
01:00:57.321 --> 01:00:58.154
<v Speaker 1>but it's just the crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When trump was saying they'd beat him </v>

1549
01:00:59.631 --> 01:01:00.464
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like crazy Joe Biden so that he </v>

1550
01:01:02.961 --> 01:01:04.290
<v Speaker 1>could beat me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beat me up,</v>

1551
01:01:04.420 --> 01:01:09.420
<v Speaker 1>that he would go down fast and hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it said.</v>

1552
01:01:09.940 --> 01:01:12.890
<v Speaker 1>I think they should've just gone with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1553
01:01:12.891 --> 01:01:15.000
<v Speaker 1>I think they should have done some sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of celebrity match.</v>

1554
01:01:15.001 --> 01:01:17.180
<v Speaker 1>That's what I was done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was saying that like,</v>

1555
01:01:17.181 --> 01:01:18.890
<v Speaker 1>let me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me be the commentator.</v>

1556
01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:19.940
<v Speaker 1>Can you see what that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1557
01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:23.270
<v Speaker 1>that'd be the president of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he definitely peaked this man.</v>

1558
01:01:23.690 --> 01:01:25.150
<v Speaker 1>Both of them would die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1559
01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:25.821
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1560
01:01:25.821 --> 01:01:27.830
<v Speaker 1>They get in the cage and it'd be all </v>
<v Speaker 1>over.</v>

1561
01:01:27.831 --> 01:01:29.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking five minutes at the hair </v>
<v Speaker 1>pull,</v>

1562
01:01:29.571 --> 01:01:31.760
<v Speaker 1>amy pull whatever little hair they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>left,</v>

1563
01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:34.970
<v Speaker 1>the old school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the old school wrestling trunks,</v>

1564
01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:40.220
<v Speaker 1>boots that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1565
01:01:40.420 --> 01:01:41.440
<v Speaker 1>we got to get this going.</v>

1566
01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:47.100
<v Speaker 1>And he was just so ridiculous to see </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump tweeting that he would beat up Joe</v>

1567
01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:48.620
<v Speaker 1>Biden if they ever fought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1568
01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:51.800
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck have you ever fought ever?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you ever even thrown a punch,</v>

1569
01:01:52.780 --> 01:01:53.930
<v Speaker 1>this is the world we live in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1570
01:01:53.931 --> 01:01:54.764
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

1571
01:01:55.370 --> 01:01:56.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the,</v>

1572
01:01:58.180 --> 01:01:59.013
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think about the things we should be </v>

1573
01:01:59.751 --> 01:02:01.870
<v Speaker 1>talking about on a daily basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1574
01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:03.193
<v Speaker 1>And yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the self inflicted wounds </v>

1575
01:02:04.731 --> 01:02:05.564
<v Speaker 1>that they constantly have coming out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that White House because of his </v>

1576
01:02:07.641 --> 01:02:08.570
<v Speaker 1>tweeting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the most part,</v>

1577
01:02:09.470 --> 01:02:10.880
<v Speaker 1>people aren't focusing on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1578
01:02:10.881 --> 01:02:11.570
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1579
01:02:11.570 --> 01:02:14.810
<v Speaker 1>we should all be able to agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Democrats and Republicans should be able</v>

1580
01:02:14.811 --> 01:02:15.420
<v Speaker 1>to agree that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1581
01:02:15.420 --> 01:02:18.320
<v Speaker 1>if you can get your way to peace on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Korean Peninsula,</v>

1582
01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:20.340
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1583
01:02:20.750 --> 01:02:22.100
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1584
01:02:22.140 --> 01:02:25.700
<v Speaker 2>they just released the three North </v>
<v Speaker 2>Korean prisoners.</v>

1585
01:02:25.830 --> 01:02:27.910
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>American citizen prisoners who were held</v>

1586
01:02:27.911 --> 01:02:30.250
<v Speaker 2>in North Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Secretary Pompei,</v>

1587
01:02:30.270 --> 01:02:31.103
<v Speaker 2>I was flying back right now from </v>
<v Speaker 2>Pyongyang and he's bringing those three </v>

1588
01:02:33.871 --> 01:02:35.220
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good thing.</v>

1589
01:02:35.250 --> 01:02:37.140
<v Speaker 2>That's a very good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we can't,</v>

1590
01:02:37.570 --> 01:02:39.220
<v Speaker 3>the way they got there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that freaks people out.</v>

1591
01:02:39.420 --> 01:02:41.800
<v Speaker 3>I am saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is nuclear buttons bigger than the other</v>

1592
01:02:41.801 --> 01:02:44.140
<v Speaker 3>guys?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>

1593
01:02:44.650 --> 01:02:48.700
<v Speaker 3>but I gotta tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was really happy watching the video of</v>

1594
01:02:48.940 --> 01:02:49.800
<v Speaker 3>Kim Jong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ooh.</v>

1595
01:02:49.801 --> 01:02:54.310
<v Speaker 3>And shaking hands with the president of </v>
<v Speaker 3>South Korea and the meeting and the DMZ.</v>

1596
01:02:54.490 --> 01:02:56.470
<v Speaker 3>I was happy that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that to me was like,</v>

1597
01:02:56.471 --> 01:02:59.280
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that made me think this might,</v>

1598
01:02:59.290 --> 01:03:02.740
<v Speaker 3>they're both smiling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know Kim Jon wounds a fucking murderer</v>

1599
01:03:02.741 --> 01:03:03.574
<v Speaker 3>and he killed his own uncle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nephews and all these different people </v>

1600
01:03:06.821 --> 01:03:07.654
<v Speaker 3>that he thought might go against him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But seeing him shake hands with the </v>

1601
01:03:12.011 --> 01:03:13.900
<v Speaker 3>president of South Korea made me think </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1602
01:03:13.901 --> 01:03:14.770
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they might</v>

1603
01:03:15.130 --> 01:03:16.240
<v Speaker 2>settle this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

1604
01:03:16.241 --> 01:03:16.751
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they could,</v>

1605
01:03:16.751 --> 01:03:18.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look as a fairy first time,</v>

1606
01:03:19.460 --> 01:03:20.570
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his Grandad,</v>

1607
01:03:20.670 --> 01:03:23.650
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give me a song and then his dad,</v>

1608
01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:25.570
<v Speaker 2>Kim Jong Il,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1609
01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:29.050
<v Speaker 2>neither of them ever step foot on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>southern side of that.</v>

1610
01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:32.530
<v Speaker 2>DMC on the south side of peace village </v>
<v Speaker 2>never happened.</v>

1611
01:03:32.770 --> 01:03:34.780
<v Speaker 2>So that in itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're absolutely right,</v>

1612
01:03:34.781 --> 01:03:37.570
<v Speaker 2>was that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a major development.</v>

1613
01:03:37.571 --> 01:03:39.190
<v Speaker 2>Now maybe nothing comes of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1614
01:03:39.220 --> 01:03:41.770
<v Speaker 2>It's a low percentage shot yet to agree </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so many moving parts.</v>

1615
01:03:41.771 --> 01:03:42.604
<v Speaker 2>So maybe nothing comes of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I think the administration is </v>

1616
01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:45.550
<v Speaker 2>making that case saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1617
01:03:45.551 --> 01:03:47.170
<v Speaker 2>we have to be realistic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1618
01:03:47.171 --> 01:03:49.420
<v Speaker 2>this is a good thing that it's moving in</v>
<v Speaker 2>that direction.</v>

1619
01:03:50.090 --> 01:03:50.923
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1620
01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:52.220
<v Speaker 3>And in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy,</v>

1621
01:03:52.270 --> 01:03:54.790
<v Speaker 3>a young guy who actually likes Dennis </v>
<v Speaker 3>Rodman,</v>

1622
01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:58.600
<v Speaker 3>I mean Jesus Christ in his playing days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1623
01:03:58.630 --> 01:04:00.400
<v Speaker 3>I like Dennis Rodman a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1624
01:04:00.401 --> 01:04:01.980
<v Speaker 3>I just didn't it to somebody now.</v>

<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1765
01:09:03.140 --> 01:09:03.973
<v Speaker 3>someone was shooting ground squirrels is</v>
<v Speaker 3>shore Badgett caring what they thought </v>

1766
01:09:06.141 --> 01:09:06.974
<v Speaker 3>was a squirrel.</v>

<v Speaker 3>they can be kept in captivity for four </v>
<v Speaker 3>easily or easily and make fun pets.</v>

1773
01:09:29.030 --> 01:09:31.510

<v Speaker 3>badger.</v>

<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1776
01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:36.673
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy has had nothing to do with a </v>

1777
01:09:37.301 --> 01:09:38.134
<v Speaker 2>badger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although it's a boost to talking about </v>

1778
01:09:39.041 --> 01:09:40.810
<v Speaker 2>small animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1779
01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:42.250
<v Speaker 2>somebody sent me a clip of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

1780
01:09:42.251 --> 01:09:43.084
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an incident where a police officer's </v>

1781
01:09:45.671 --> 01:09:46.504
<v Speaker 2>driving down the road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then he stopped traffic on both sides </v>

1782
01:09:47.681 --> 01:09:50.410
<v Speaker 2>cause a groundhog was trying to come </v>
<v Speaker 2>across the street.</v>

1783
01:09:50.540 --> 01:09:52.180
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he was trying to,</v>

1784
01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:53.353
<v Speaker 2>it was about a quarter of the way across</v>
<v Speaker 2>this two lane road and he was trying to </v>

1785
01:09:56.351 --> 01:09:57.490
<v Speaker 2>back it off the street.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1786
01:09:57.491 --> 01:09:58.840
<v Speaker 2>That was a nice humanitarian thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1787
01:09:58.841 --> 01:10:01.120
<v Speaker 2>He's trying to help this animal get off </v>
<v Speaker 2>or it doesn't get hit by cars.</v>

1788
01:10:02.260 --> 01:10:03.240
<v Speaker 2>And this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1789
01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:06.100
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he keeps trying and keeps trying.</v>

1790
01:10:06.101 --> 01:10:07.150
<v Speaker 2>It's not working.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1791
01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:11.480
<v Speaker 2>the groundhog won't leave and eventually</v>
<v Speaker 2>the groundhog,</v>

1792
01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:13.330
<v Speaker 2>I guess something snapped in his mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then he decided,</v>

1793
01:10:13.350 --> 01:10:13.901
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck this,</v>

1794
01:10:13.901 --> 01:10:15.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go after this police </v>
<v Speaker 2>officer.</v>

1795
01:10:15.581 --> 01:10:16.690
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess he got tired.</v>

1796
01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:17.753
<v Speaker 2>So he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he kind of waddled up to the police </v>

1797
01:10:18.701 --> 01:10:19.341
<v Speaker 2>officer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it,</v>

1798
01:10:19.341 --> 01:10:19.901
<v Speaker 2>this is it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1799
01:10:19.901 --> 01:10:21.340
<v Speaker 2>This is it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now watch what happens.</v>

1800
01:10:23.420 --> 01:10:26.030
<v Speaker 3>This is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the COP has 10.</v>

1801
01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:27.020
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he didn't shoot it.</v>

1802
01:10:27.380 --> 01:10:31.190
<v Speaker 3>He did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He got on his knees and shot the fucking</v>

1803
01:10:31.340 --> 01:10:33.590
<v Speaker 3>groundhog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like how they blur it out.</v>

1804
01:10:33.890 --> 01:10:35.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The identity.</v>

1805
01:10:35.390 --> 01:10:37.550
<v Speaker 2>The identity of the groundhog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1806
01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:40.900
<v Speaker 2>So it's moving away now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's still moving.</v>

1807
01:10:41.590 --> 01:10:42.910
<v Speaker 2>Does he show it again?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1808
01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.790
<v Speaker 2>But watch it comes at form again.</v>

1809
01:10:47.740 --> 01:10:48.573
<v Speaker 4>Well</v>

1810
01:10:49.170 --> 01:10:50.003
<v Speaker 2>that seems inappropriate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I grabbed the police said was blocking </v>

1811
01:10:54.151 --> 01:10:57.820
<v Speaker 2>traffic was fatally shot Sunday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew I was in the New York daily.</v>

1812
01:10:57.870 --> 01:11:00.300
<v Speaker 2>There was this Maryland.</v>

1813
01:11:01.150 --> 01:11:03.640
<v Speaker 3>Oh boy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1814
01:11:03.641 --> 01:11:06.280
<v Speaker 3>he realized that it was not responding </v>
<v Speaker 3>as an,</v>

1815
01:11:06.340 --> 01:11:07.173
<v Speaker 3>as expected for an animal that was not </v>
<v Speaker 3>being cornered or trapped believing the </v>

1816
01:11:11.411 --> 01:11:13.740
<v Speaker 3>groundhog to be either sick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>injured.</v>

1817
01:11:14.340 --> 01:11:16.320
<v Speaker 1>He shot it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I love it.</v>

1818
01:11:16.321 --> 01:11:18.870
<v Speaker 1>I love this response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am sure the officer did the best thing</v>

1819
01:11:18.871 --> 01:11:21.240
<v Speaker 1>in this situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not for me to judge.</v>

1820
01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:25.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can't kick a groundhogs ass,</v>

1821
01:11:25.321 --> 01:11:29.070
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't be a cop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I have to say that because I</v>

1822
01:11:29.071 --> 01:11:31.560
<v Speaker 1>don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's coming after you sidestep pitch and</v>

1823
01:11:31.561 --> 01:11:33.070
<v Speaker 1>also you can't take it down with one </v>
<v Speaker 1>shot.</v>

1824
01:11:33.260 --> 01:11:34.830
<v Speaker 1>What the Hell is wrong with that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1825
01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:37.650
<v Speaker 1>How slow is it moving too?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just,</v>

1826
01:11:37.651 --> 01:11:38.520
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>

1827
01:11:38.940 --> 01:11:42.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not the fastest animals,</v>

1828
01:11:42.670 --> 01:11:43.580
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1829
01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:45.840
<v Speaker 1>it was not in a full sprint towards this</v>
<v Speaker 1>officer.</v>

1830
01:11:45.870 --> 01:11:46.860
<v Speaker 1>I'd just say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>

1831
01:11:47.140 --> 01:11:49.260
<v Speaker 1>None of us can put ourselves in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>officer's shoes.</v>

1832
01:11:49.261 --> 01:11:50.094
<v Speaker 1>Let's just put it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These getting an irrational fear of </v>

1833
01:11:51.601 --> 01:11:54.690
<v Speaker 1>mammals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None of us have been in combat against a</v>

1834
01:11:54.691 --> 01:11:57.860
<v Speaker 1>small animal creature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would it?</v>

1835
01:11:58.170 --> 01:12:01.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean I fucking groundhog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

1836
01:12:01.780 --> 01:12:02.613
<v Speaker 1>What do you got it too?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like you just get out of the </v>

1837
01:12:03.721 --> 01:12:06.820
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to shoot a groundhog.</v>

1838
01:12:06.990 --> 01:12:08.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just get back in your cruiser and assume</v>

1839
01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:10.000
<v Speaker 1>people are going to drive around it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1840
01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:11.393
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that was interesting and </v>

1841
01:12:12.211 --> 01:12:13.770
<v Speaker 1>someone thought it was interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to send along,</v>

1842
01:12:13.830 --> 01:12:15.420
<v Speaker 1>so that was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did that.</v>

1843
01:12:15.450 --> 01:12:16.283
<v Speaker 1>I think sometimes you give people a gun </v>
<v Speaker 1>that just looking to shoot some after a </v>

1844
01:12:19.091 --> 01:12:20.710
<v Speaker 1>while I'm shooting something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1845
01:12:20.730 --> 01:12:23.950
<v Speaker 1>this groundhog is fucking with society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1846
01:12:24.300 --> 01:12:25.133
<v Speaker 1>it's like that old far side cartoon with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the vultures sitting up there and </v>

1847
01:12:26.581 --> 01:12:27.060
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>damn it,</v>

1848
01:12:27.060 --> 01:12:28.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to kill something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1849
01:12:29.310 --> 01:12:32.910
<v Speaker 1>So you know that expression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you only have a hammer,</v>

1850
01:12:32.911 --> 01:12:34.740
<v Speaker 1>everything seems like a male.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1851
01:12:34.780 --> 01:12:37.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you gave that Cabo can of bear</v>

1852
01:12:37.741 --> 01:12:39.570
<v Speaker 1>spray,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's a good point.</v>

1853
01:12:40.140 --> 01:12:41.370
<v Speaker 1>Less than deadly force.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1854
01:12:41.730 --> 01:12:44.040
<v Speaker 1>It could have tased it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1855
01:12:44.100 --> 01:12:45.140
<v Speaker 1>probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

1856
01:12:45.180 --> 01:12:46.140
<v Speaker 1>probably would've killed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Killed it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>of the companies that brought me in for </v>

1956
01:16:47.711 --> 01:16:49.990

01:17:19.101 --> 01:17:21.290
<v Speaker 2>it is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't want me to talk about it,</v>

1973
01:17:21.500 --> 01:17:23.090
<v Speaker 2>don't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't do it.</v>

1974
01:17:23.540 --> 01:17:24.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1975
01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:25.480
<v Speaker 2>so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1976
01:17:25.670 --> 01:17:27.950
<v Speaker 2>that's another issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just ticking off all the issues that</v>

1977
01:17:27.951 --> 01:17:28.784
<v Speaker 2>we've solved here so far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We get that we're going to face the </v>

1978
01:17:30.081 --> 01:17:31.160
<v Speaker 2>world here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mike Baker,</v>

1979
01:17:32.260 --> 01:17:34.280
<v Speaker 2>but that the North Korean released to </v>
<v Speaker 2>those prisoners.</v>

1980
01:17:34.281 --> 01:17:35.720
<v Speaker 2>That's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a good thing.</v>

1981
01:17:35.750 --> 01:17:36.583
<v Speaker 2>And I think both trump and pence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think of going out to Andrews Air </v>

1982
01:17:40.490 --> 01:17:43.590
<v Speaker 2>Force base to meet them as they come in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1983
01:17:44.220 --> 01:17:45.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it will be,</v>

1984
01:17:45.740 --> 01:17:46.630
<v Speaker 2>it'll be interesting to see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1985
01:17:46.631 --> 01:17:49.460
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was an easy give for Kim Jong</v>

1986
01:17:49.460 --> 01:17:50.400
<v Speaker 2>Un to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1987
01:17:50.570 --> 01:17:53.210
<v Speaker 2>And what were they over there in prison </v>
<v Speaker 2>for?</v>

1988
01:17:53.900 --> 01:17:56.290
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of them what I'm wants a businessman</v>

1989
01:17:57.110 --> 01:18:01.460
<v Speaker 2>and he was serving 10 years hard labor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine hard labor camp and with Korea,</v>

1990
01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.520
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for supposedly for espionage.</v>

1991
01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:07.310
<v Speaker 2>He's a business guy and they don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1992
01:18:07.311 --> 01:18:09.050
<v Speaker 2>they've done this numerous times in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>past.</v>

1993
01:18:09.051 --> 01:18:11.210
<v Speaker 2>It really doesn't matter if you show up </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're in business.</v>

1994
01:18:11.300 --> 01:18:14.750
<v Speaker 2>The other two were also interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were academics.</v>

1995
01:18:14.751 --> 01:18:19.580
<v Speaker 2>They were at the Pyongyang University </v>
<v Speaker 2>for Science and technology.</v>

1996
01:18:20.270 --> 01:18:21.103
<v Speaker 2>Both of them were teaching there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is oddly enough where I got my </v>

1997
01:18:24.141 --> 01:18:25.600
<v Speaker 2>degree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1998
01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:27.510
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1999
01:18:27.650 --> 01:18:30.020
<v Speaker 2>my undergrad degree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pyongyang University,</v>

2000
01:18:30.790 --> 01:18:32.330
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went there for the sports.</v>

2001
01:18:35.420 --> 01:18:37.130
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

2002
01:18:37.180 --> 01:18:40.790
<v Speaker 2>and I worked during the year as the mat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the peel and gang missiles.</v>

2003
01:18:41.210 --> 01:18:43.640
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a guy dressed as a missile.</v>

2004
01:18:43.720 --> 01:18:46.070
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

2005
01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:47.220
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2006
01:18:47.220 --> 01:18:48.053
<v Speaker 2>honest to God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember where I was going with </v>

2007
01:18:48.921 --> 01:18:49.754
<v Speaker 2>the story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I just like rambling until I get </v>

2008
01:18:50.841 --> 01:18:53.990
<v Speaker 2>my head straight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like that deer in that video.</v>

2009
01:18:54.860 --> 01:18:58.430
<v Speaker 2>So those two were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were again the same thing,</v>

2010
01:18:58.460 --> 01:19:01.940
<v Speaker 2>supposedly engaged in espionage and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>they got chucked in.</v>

2011
01:19:02.230 --> 01:19:04.010
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we'll see.</v>

2012
01:19:04.011 --> 01:19:04.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2013
01:19:04.430 --> 01:19:05.263
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether,</v>

2014
01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:07.490
<v Speaker 2>whether we're able to get anything from </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

2015
01:19:07.491 --> 01:19:09.620
<v Speaker 2>who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's a good sign.</v>

2016
01:19:09.621 --> 01:19:11.330
<v Speaker 2>The fact that he met with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you pointed out,</v>

2017
01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:13.850
<v Speaker 2>President Moon from South Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very good sign.</v>

2018
01:19:14.130 --> 01:19:16.020
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Chinese have a,</v>

2019
01:19:16.100 --> 01:19:18.350
<v Speaker 2>they sent their foreign minister over to</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pyongyang,</v>

2020
01:19:18.460 --> 01:19:20.090
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>couple of weeks ago.</v>

2021
01:19:20.180 --> 01:19:23.600
<v Speaker 2>First time foreign minister has been </v>
<v Speaker 2>over there and maybe 11 years,</v>

2022
01:19:23.601 --> 01:19:24.250
<v Speaker 2>12 years.</v>

2023
01:19:24.250 --> 01:19:25.083
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they understand the importance of </v>

2024
01:19:26.301 --> 01:19:30.860
<v Speaker 2>this and I think everybody's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dynamic has shifted because I think,</v>

2025
01:19:30.890 --> 01:19:31.723
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've kicked the can down the road for </v>

2026
01:19:32.601 --> 01:19:33.434
<v Speaker 2>so long that there were basically at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>point where their programs are close to </v>

2027
01:19:37.851 --> 01:19:40.120
<v Speaker 2>being fully developed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think the,</v>

2028
01:19:40.130 --> 01:19:40.963
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Chinese understand that that means </v>

2029
01:19:42.021 --> 01:19:42.854
<v Speaker 2>that all those other options perhaps of </v>
<v Speaker 2>kicking the can down the road aren't on </v>

2030
01:19:45.891 --> 01:19:47.810
<v Speaker 2>the decision tree anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

2031
01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:50.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't want chaos on the peninsula.</v>

2032
01:19:50.750 --> 01:19:52.550
<v Speaker 2>They don't want military conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody does.</v>

2033
01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:53.833
<v Speaker 2>And so I think the Chinese for basically</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first time I've been aggressively </v>

2034
01:19:56.840 --> 01:19:57.673
<v Speaker 2>assisting with the sanctions that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>put in place that had a very quick </v>

2035
01:20:00.650 --> 01:20:03.320
<v Speaker 2>response on Kim Jong Un,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not suicidal,</v>

2036
01:20:03.321 --> 01:20:05.630
<v Speaker 2>he just wants to survive in position of </v>
<v Speaker 2>leadership.</v>

2037
01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:07.320
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's looking at it thinking,</v>

2038
01:20:07.321 --> 01:20:08.154
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the calculus has changed so I gotta do </v>

2039
01:20:09.781 --> 01:20:11.400
<v Speaker 2>something different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

2040
01:20:11.430 --> 01:20:12.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being pragmatic,</v>

2041
01:20:12.540 --> 01:20:14.790
<v Speaker 2>maybe it doesn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at least we're trying.</v>

2042
01:20:14.820 --> 01:20:16.360
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

2043
01:20:16.630 --> 01:20:17.680
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unquestionably,</v>

2044
01:20:17.681 --> 01:20:18.514
<v Speaker 3>it's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And also the video that North Korean </v>

2045
01:20:20.261 --> 01:20:25.261
<v Speaker 3>soldier fleeing and getting shot shot at</v>
<v Speaker 3>as he escapes North Korea,</v>

2046
01:20:26.741 --> 01:20:29.020
<v Speaker 3>I mean that had to get to North Korea </v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

2047
01:20:29.021 --> 01:20:29.854
<v Speaker 3>and they realize like Jesus Christ is </v>
<v Speaker 3>the second guy and how many months that </v>

2048
01:20:32.951 --> 01:20:37.720
<v Speaker 3>was fleeing like that and got away and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're finding parasites in their body.</v>

2049
01:20:37.721 --> 01:20:41.800
<v Speaker 3>And extreme malnourishment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is a soldier.</v>

2050
01:20:41.801 --> 01:20:45.940
<v Speaker 3>So you gotta think everybody over there </v>
<v Speaker 3>is probably in an in dire straits.</v>

2051
01:20:45.970 --> 01:20:46.803
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we've talked about this in terms of </v>

2052
01:20:47.891 --> 01:20:48.760
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a simple,</v>

2053
01:20:48.820 --> 01:20:50.620
<v Speaker 2>not simple,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the idea that,</v>

2054
01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:51.633
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the population in terms of its physical </v>

2055
01:20:53.111 --> 01:20:56.140
<v Speaker 2>stature compared to the South Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're shorter.</v>

2056
01:20:56.150 --> 01:20:57.350
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're uh,</v>

2057
01:20:58.340 --> 01:20:59.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a malnutrition issue.</v>

2058
01:20:59.700 --> 01:21:00.533
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think also I think they've realized </v>

2059
01:21:01.781 --> 01:21:06.781
<v Speaker 2>that there's only so much they can do </v>
<v Speaker 2>going forward to lock the place down.</v>

2060
01:21:07.270 --> 01:21:08.740
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And technology at some point,</v>

2061
01:21:08.741 --> 01:21:11.230
<v Speaker 2>even though it's North Korea and there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a lot there,</v>

2062
01:21:11.740 --> 01:21:13.730
<v Speaker 2>there's enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think there's a sense that they,</v>

2063
01:21:13.731 --> 01:21:14.564
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how long can they can control the </v>

2064
01:21:16.001 --> 01:21:17.920
<v Speaker 2>population the way they have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>

2065
01:21:17.921 --> 01:21:19.670
<v Speaker 2>he's not the Kim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2066
01:21:19.870 --> 01:21:22.750
<v Speaker 2>is not suicidal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wants to maintain power.</v>

2067
01:21:22.930 --> 01:21:24.500
<v Speaker 2>When you think about every country </v>
<v Speaker 2>action,</v>

2068
01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:27.010
<v Speaker 2>its own best interest for every leader </v>
<v Speaker 2>acts in their own best interest.</v>

2069
01:21:27.220 --> 01:21:30.460
<v Speaker 2>That's his thought process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how do I do that?</v>

2070
01:21:30.460 --> 01:21:31.630
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2071
01:21:32.130 --> 01:21:32.980
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe,</v>

2072
01:21:33.070 --> 01:21:33.903
<v Speaker 2>so I think that it could happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We could get something really good out </v>

2073
01:21:36.341 --> 01:21:37.174
<v Speaker 2>of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll see.</v>

2074
01:21:38.130 --> 01:21:40.420
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the Iranians who are watching it and</v>

2075
01:21:40.421 --> 01:21:42.190
<v Speaker 2>North Koreans are watching what we did </v>
<v Speaker 2>over the Iran.</v>

2076
01:21:42.550 --> 01:21:45.730
<v Speaker 2>I disagree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That whole notion that North Koreans are</v>

2077
01:21:45.731 --> 01:21:46.860
<v Speaker 2>going to look at it and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>

2078
01:21:46.861 --> 01:21:48.490
<v Speaker 2>it means we can't trust them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

2079
01:21:48.670 --> 01:21:50.710
<v Speaker 2>if President Obama was so enamored with </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2080
01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:53.920
<v Speaker 2>that deal that he made with the Iranians</v>
<v Speaker 2>will then take it to the Senate,</v>

2081
01:21:54.160 --> 01:21:56.020
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get it,</v>

2082
01:21:56.250 --> 01:21:58.630
<v Speaker 2>make it a treaty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You made it a,</v>

2083
01:21:58.631 --> 01:22:01.210
<v Speaker 2>an agreement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an executive order basically.</v>

2084
01:22:01.630 --> 01:22:04.180
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2085
01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:05.073
<v Speaker 2>they're not looking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think the North Koreans were </v>

2086
01:22:05.691 --> 01:22:08.050
<v Speaker 2>looking at this and going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trump is going back on his word.</v>

2087
01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:10.120
<v Speaker 2>I think they're looking at and going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trump's okay.</v>

2088
01:22:10.121 --> 01:22:11.700
<v Speaker 2>He means that he's not gonna put up with</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

2089
01:22:12.110 --> 01:22:15.310
<v Speaker 2>a bad deal and this wasn't that good a </v>
<v Speaker 2>deal.</v>

2090
01:22:15.310 --> 01:22:17.860
<v Speaker 2>So I think that's the way that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>would process it.</v>

2091
01:22:18.630 --> 01:22:19.900
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we'll see.</v>

2092
01:22:19.901 --> 01:22:21.250
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows where they were on,</v>

2093
01:22:21.251 --> 01:22:22.420
<v Speaker 2>he was going to go with what they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

2094
01:22:22.540 --> 01:22:23.230
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2095
01:22:23.230 --> 01:22:24.490
<v Speaker 2>people right now listening are probably </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking,</v>

2096
01:22:24.491 --> 01:22:25.324
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm tired of listening about the </v>

2097
01:22:25.691 --> 01:22:26.690
<v Speaker 2>Iranians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2098
01:22:26.950 --> 01:22:29.180
<v Speaker 2>well that seems to be something that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>were really concerned about.</v>

2099
01:22:29.560 --> 01:22:30.700
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think only because,</v>

2100
01:22:30.730 --> 01:22:31.870
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2101
01:22:31.930 --> 01:22:32.651
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's,</v>

2102
01:22:32.651 --> 01:22:34.780
<v Speaker 2>if it's not handled properly and there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of moving parts,</v>

2103
01:22:34.781 --> 01:22:36.540
<v Speaker 2>meaning our allies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2104
01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:39.670
<v Speaker 2>meaning the wildcard of what Rouhani and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the regime was going to do.</v>

2105
01:22:39.790 --> 01:22:40.720
<v Speaker 2>But look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make no mistake,</v>

2106
01:22:40.721 --> 01:22:41.554
<v Speaker 2>there's no this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2107
01:22:41.590 --> 01:22:45.220
<v Speaker 2>this idea that somehow that this was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>moderate Iranian regime,</v>

2108
01:22:45.340 --> 01:22:46.173
<v Speaker 2>all you gotta do is look at what they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>engaged in doing in the Lebanon and </v>

2109
01:22:48.491 --> 01:22:51.850
<v Speaker 2>Yemen and the proxy war with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the Saudis and others,</v>

2110
01:22:52.150 --> 01:22:53.620
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Iraq and Syria,</v>

2111
01:22:53.750 --> 01:22:56.230
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the work that they're doing it in all</v>

2112
01:22:56.231 --> 01:22:57.770
<v Speaker 2>the soldiers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>US soldiers,</v>

2113
01:22:57.820 --> 01:22:59.230
<v Speaker 2>they killed in Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2114
01:22:59.231 --> 01:23:04.231
<v Speaker 2>through the provision of weapons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the training that they gave to,</v>

2115
01:23:04.650 --> 01:23:05.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

2116
01:23:05.681 --> 01:23:06.514
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Iraqis that were fighting against </v>

2117
01:23:07.961 --> 01:23:10.030
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2118
01:23:10.031 --> 01:23:11.100
<v Speaker 2>Look at all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you think,</v>

2119
01:23:11.130 --> 01:23:11.963
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at what point did somebody make some </v>

2120
01:23:14.281 --> 01:23:15.820
<v Speaker 2>decision that the Iranians were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2121
01:23:15.860 --> 01:23:18.210
<v Speaker 2>somehow moderate because they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not,</v>

2122
01:23:18.270 --> 01:23:19.470
<v Speaker 2>that regime isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2123
01:23:19.471 --> 01:23:21.750
<v Speaker 2>the people themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we keep hoping one day.</v>

2124
01:23:21.751 --> 01:23:25.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean you go all the way back to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fall of the Shah and you know,</v>

2125
01:23:25.320 --> 01:23:29.250
<v Speaker 2>people hoping that the people will rise </v>
<v Speaker 2>up and overthrow the clerics.</v>

2126
01:23:29.430 --> 01:23:30.040
<v Speaker 2>Do you think</v>

2127
01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:32.260
<v Speaker 3>same attitude that causes people to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>apologists,</v>

2128
01:23:32.261 --> 01:23:34.480
<v Speaker 3>like the same attitude it's causing </v>
<v Speaker 3>people to ask.</v>

2129
01:23:35.470 --> 01:23:38.320
<v Speaker 3>How do you feel about those people being</v>
<v Speaker 3>tortured?</v>

2130
01:23:38.321 --> 01:23:39.154
<v Speaker 3>Is it the same sort of mentality that </v>
<v Speaker 3>allows people to want those Iranians to </v>

2131
01:23:43.751 --> 01:23:44.584
<v Speaker 3>be a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the want the people that are empowered </v>

2132
01:23:45.671 --> 01:23:46.504
<v Speaker 3>to be moderate?</v>

2133
01:23:46.950 --> 01:23:47.761
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

2134
01:23:47.761 --> 01:23:48.594
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2135
01:23:48.990 --> 01:23:50.790
<v Speaker 2>I think there's an element of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>

2136
01:23:50.791 --> 01:23:51.624
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2137
01:23:52.590 --> 01:23:55.230
<v Speaker 2>it's a desire to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2138
01:23:56.760 --> 01:23:57.630
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of think,</v>

2139
01:23:57.631 --> 01:24:00.180
<v Speaker 2>well I'd add that part of it I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>really understand.</v>

2140
01:24:00.181 --> 01:24:01.014
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause you would think that you would </v>

2141
01:24:01.291 --> 01:24:02.124
<v Speaker 2>base that on people's performance and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all you gotta do is look at past </v>

2142
01:24:03.751 --> 01:24:06.690
<v Speaker 2>performance of the clerics and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>regime there in Iran that runs things.</v>

2143
01:24:07.080 --> 01:24:09.090
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know how you come away from </v>
<v Speaker 2>it thinking,</v>

2144
01:24:09.091 --> 01:24:09.511
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2145
01:24:09.511 --> 01:24:11.190
<v Speaker 2>they're being actually pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty moderate.</v>

2146
01:24:11.191 --> 01:24:13.400
<v Speaker 2>They're being pretty conciliatory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2147
01:24:13.810 --> 01:24:14.643
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's what we got to previous </v>

2148
01:24:15.451 --> 01:24:16.284
<v Speaker 2>administration did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just stretched themselves then </v>

2149
01:24:18.151 --> 01:24:21.780
<v Speaker 2>trying to sell this deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2150
01:24:21.781 --> 01:24:24.420
<v Speaker 2>they did everything they could to try to</v>
<v Speaker 2>race to it,</v>

2151
01:24:24.421 --> 01:24:26.520
<v Speaker 2>make sure it was going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They set things aside.</v>

2152
01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:29.120
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

2153
01:24:29.220 --> 01:24:31.430
<v Speaker 2>we've caught the Iranians in the past </v>
<v Speaker 2>cheating and that,</v>

2154
01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:32.790
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this business with Netanyahu,</v>

2155
01:24:32.791 --> 01:24:33.624
<v Speaker 2>when he came out with this information </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they pulled out of this warehouse </v>

2156
01:24:35.461 --> 01:24:36.294
<v Speaker 2>where it's being stored.</v>

2157
01:24:36.690 --> 01:24:37.770
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was,</v>

2158
01:24:37.790 --> 01:24:40.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>historical covered the period of 1999 to</v>

2159
01:24:40.261 --> 01:24:42.450
<v Speaker 2>2003.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was that again?</v>

2160
01:24:42.510 --> 01:24:43.880
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Word Messiah,</v>

2161
01:24:43.940 --> 01:24:46.050
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had an operation that they engaged in.</v>

2162
01:24:46.110 --> 01:24:48.020
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a warehouse in tech,</v>

2163
01:24:48.021 --> 01:24:49.230
<v Speaker 2>Ron,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>

2164
01:24:50.030 --> 01:24:52.050
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Iranian regime,</v>

2165
01:24:52.630 --> 01:24:53.463
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rather than destroy all their research </v>

2166
01:24:55.201 --> 01:24:57.150
<v Speaker 2>and all the work that we're doing on </v>
<v Speaker 2>nuclear weapons,</v>

2167
01:24:57.210 --> 01:24:58.230
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>up until that time,</v>

2168
01:24:58.500 --> 01:24:59.333
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2169
01:24:59.490 --> 01:25:00.323
<v Speaker 2>during that time they stored it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they put it in a warehouse </v>

2170
01:25:05.371 --> 01:25:07.170
<v Speaker 2>facility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2171
01:25:07.830 --> 01:25:09.300
<v Speaker 2>massage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2172
01:25:09.630 --> 01:25:12.240
<v Speaker 2>and some others liaison service found </v>
<v Speaker 2>out that,</v>

2173
01:25:12.270 --> 01:25:13.103
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the location and then they mounted </v>

2174
01:25:15.361 --> 01:25:16.194
<v Speaker 2>an operation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a very labor intensive to try </v>

2175
01:25:18.421 --> 01:25:19.890
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to do a lot of surveillance.</v>

2176
01:25:19.891 --> 01:25:22.590
<v Speaker 2>You gotta recruit assets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who can provide you with key information</v>

2177
01:25:22.591 --> 01:25:23.424
<v Speaker 2>about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then eventually they hiked out a </v>

2178
01:25:24.151 --> 01:25:25.730
<v Speaker 2>bunch of these documents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't,</v>

2179
01:25:25.731 --> 01:25:28.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>50,000 pages of documents and almost 200</v>

2180
01:25:28.621 --> 01:25:29.930
<v Speaker 2>cds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2181
01:25:29.940 --> 01:25:30.773
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2182
01:25:31.230 --> 01:25:35.820
<v Speaker 2>and that information covers 1999 to </v>
<v Speaker 2>2003.</v>

2183
01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:36.713
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that it shows </v>
<v Speaker 2>definitively is that one of the things </v>

2184
01:25:39.641 --> 01:25:40.474
<v Speaker 2>that you're running is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were doing were they were designing and </v>

2185
01:25:41.701 --> 01:25:44.550
<v Speaker 2>looking to build a minimum of five </v>
<v Speaker 2>nuclear warheads,</v>

2186
01:25:44.790 --> 01:25:45.623
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For their ballistic missiles that they </v>

2187
01:25:46.991 --> 01:25:47.824
<v Speaker 2>are also developing a building,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which puts a nail in that whole idea </v>

2188
01:25:50.371 --> 01:25:51.990
<v Speaker 2>that it was nothing but a peaceful </v>
<v Speaker 2>program.</v>

2189
01:25:52.620 --> 01:25:54.480
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people looking at it,</v>

2190
01:25:54.510 --> 01:25:55.810
<v Speaker 2>they're apologists and the sink,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2191
01:25:55.811 --> 01:25:57.000
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's old history.</v>

2192
01:25:57.001 --> 01:25:58.830
<v Speaker 2>It's old news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't tell us anything new.</v>

2193
01:25:58.860 --> 01:25:59.693
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it tells us and confirms to us what </v>

2194
01:26:01.741 --> 01:26:02.970
<v Speaker 2>we've been saying all along,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

2195
01:26:03.230 --> 01:26:04.063
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were lying about it and they were </v>

2196
01:26:06.321 --> 01:26:07.154
<v Speaker 2>lying about the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the extent of their centrifuge </v>

2197
01:26:09.231 --> 01:26:10.650
<v Speaker 2>operations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2198
01:26:10.810 --> 01:26:14.390
<v Speaker 2>the extent of the stored materials that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they had.</v>

2199
01:26:15.020 --> 01:26:17.810
<v Speaker 2>And so I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2200
01:26:17.811 --> 01:26:19.430
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't know how you make that leap</v>

2201
01:26:19.431 --> 01:26:20.091
<v Speaker 2>to then say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2202
01:26:20.091 --> 01:26:20.924
<v Speaker 2>now they're fine.</v>

2203
01:26:20.980 --> 01:26:22.580
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now that now we can believe them.</v>

2204
01:26:22.970 --> 01:26:25.270
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because why I don't get,</v>

2205
01:26:25.290 --> 01:26:26.123
<v Speaker 2>I don't get that part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm not willing to see it until they </v>

2206
01:26:28.230 --> 01:26:30.440
<v Speaker 2>want to give us 100% access to all their</v>
<v Speaker 2>sites.</v>

2207
01:26:30.590 --> 01:26:31.423
<v Speaker 2>They want to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on in and look at Parchin come on </v>

2208
01:26:32.481 --> 01:26:33.314
<v Speaker 2>and look at the military facilities that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we used to be where we are used for </v>

2209
01:26:35.121 --> 01:26:37.310
<v Speaker 2>weapons development in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>

2210
01:26:37.580 --> 01:26:39.740
<v Speaker 2>Now you got something and now I'll back </v>
<v Speaker 2>off and say,</v>

2211
01:26:40.010 --> 01:26:40.970
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2212
01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:41.833
<v Speaker 2>maybe that's a good deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually give us access to all those </v>

2213
01:26:43.491 --> 01:26:44.900
<v Speaker 2>sites.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2214
01:26:45.110 --> 01:26:48.470
<v Speaker 2>and let us go in and look around the </v>
<v Speaker 2>IAEA,</v>

2215
01:26:48.471 --> 01:26:51.130
<v Speaker 2>which is the international organization </v>
<v Speaker 2>for inspection of,</v>

2216
01:26:51.131 --> 01:26:52.610
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of these nuclear sites.</v>

2217
01:26:53.900 --> 01:26:57.650
<v Speaker 2>They spent 12 years trying to figure out</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the hell was going on at Parchin,</v>

2218
01:26:57.800 --> 01:27:01.700
<v Speaker 2>which is a military site near terror and</v>
<v Speaker 2>never,</v>

2219
01:27:01.790 --> 01:27:03.950
<v Speaker 2>never were able to get the access they </v>
<v Speaker 2>needed,</v>

2220
01:27:03.951 --> 01:27:05.540
<v Speaker 2>never were able to solve the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2221
01:27:05.570 --> 01:27:06.410
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the question.</v>

2222
01:27:06.530 --> 01:27:08.450
<v Speaker 2>And they went on and on with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>investigation.</v>

2223
01:27:08.451 --> 01:27:09.081
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guess what,</v>

2224
01:27:09.081 --> 01:27:12.230
<v Speaker 2>as a result of the drive by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>administration to get a deal signed,</v>

2225
01:27:12.890 --> 01:27:13.723
<v Speaker 2>part of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the conditions from the Iranian regime </v>

2226
01:27:15.920 --> 01:27:17.600
<v Speaker 2>was that they stopped this </v>
<v Speaker 2>investigation,</v>

2227
01:27:17.660 --> 01:27:19.580
<v Speaker 2>just draw a line under it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had no,</v>

2228
01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:21.620
<v Speaker 2>they had no answers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they just said,</v>

2229
01:27:21.621 --> 01:27:21.911
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2230
01:27:21.911 --> 01:27:24.050
<v Speaker 2>we're not gonna sign a deal unless you </v>
<v Speaker 2>stop that investigation.</v>

2231
01:27:24.260 --> 01:27:25.490
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we did,</v>

2232
01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:27.620
<v Speaker 2>we stopped the investigation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

2233
01:27:27.710 --> 01:27:28.550
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they also say,</v>

2241
01:27:34.721 --> 01:27:37.670
<v Speaker 2>A ballistic missile technology </v>
<v Speaker 2>developments are a weapons program.</v>

2242
01:27:38.030 --> 01:27:38.481
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

01:27:38.481 --> 01:27:40.790
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's doing made this decisions?</v>

2244
01:27:41.480 --> 01:27:42.081
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was,</v>

2245
01:27:42.081 --> 01:27:43.300
<v Speaker 2>this was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2246
01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:45.860
<v Speaker 2>two years is as his former secretary </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kerry would like to say,</v>

2247
01:27:45.930 --> 01:27:46.310
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2248
01:27:46.310 --> 01:27:49.160
<v Speaker 2>it was two years of diplomatic work and </v>
<v Speaker 2>hard negotiation,</v>

2249
01:27:49.161 --> 01:27:49.960
<v Speaker 2>hard negotiation.</v>

2250
01:27:49.960 --> 01:27:50.793
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on,</v>

2251
01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:52.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

2252
01:27:53.030 --> 01:27:54.140
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2253
01:27:54.141 --> 01:27:57.440
<v Speaker 2>we worked reportedly in concert with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brits and the French and the Germans and</v>

2254
01:27:57.441 --> 01:27:58.850
<v Speaker 2>the Russians and the Chinese.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2255
01:27:58.851 --> 01:28:00.080
<v Speaker 2>although it was mostly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2256
01:28:00.081 --> 01:28:01.790
<v Speaker 2>from our side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2257
01:28:02.330 --> 01:28:05.420
<v Speaker 2>and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>know it is what it is.</v>

2258
01:28:05.450 --> 01:28:07.270
<v Speaker 2>So are they complying with what they've </v>
<v Speaker 2>got in,</v>

2259
01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:08.540
<v Speaker 2>in the terms of the agreement?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2260
01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:10.760
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I like,</v>

2261
01:28:10.790 --> 01:28:11.900
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think,</v>

2262
01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:13.820
<v Speaker 2>and it kind of goes to that point about </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

2263
01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:15.590
<v Speaker 2>the truth is always kind of in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>middle,</v>

2264
01:28:15.591 --> 01:28:16.011
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2265
01:28:16.011 --> 01:28:18.380
<v Speaker 2>the truth is somewhere there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like it's not,</v>

2266
01:28:18.410 --> 01:28:22.010
<v Speaker 2>it's not me throwing grenades at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the progressive is little laughter.</v>

2267
01:28:22.011 --> 01:28:23.540
<v Speaker 2>The Democrats saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>

2268
01:28:23.541 --> 01:28:24.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a terrible deal at socks.</v>

2269
01:28:24.841 --> 01:28:25.311
<v Speaker 2>And Alex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

2270
01:28:25.311 --> 01:28:25.821
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2271
01:28:25.821 --> 01:28:26.654
<v Speaker 2>I deal could be good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm glad that we've been able to </v>

2272
01:28:28.790 --> 01:28:31.160
<v Speaker 2>inspect those sites that have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>available.</v>

2273
01:28:31.160 --> 01:28:31.993
<v Speaker 2>That's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But don't couch it as something that's </v>

2274
01:28:34.611 --> 01:28:36.350
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

2275
01:28:36.410 --> 01:28:37.243
<v Speaker 2>if the Brits and the French and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Germans are now willing to say it's an </v>

2276
01:28:40.161 --> 01:28:42.350
<v Speaker 2>inadequate deal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we still want to stay in,</v>

2277
01:28:43.100 --> 01:28:45.290
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2278
01:28:45.291 --> 01:28:47.290
<v Speaker 2>that should,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that should tell people something and,</v>

2279
01:28:47.291 --> 01:28:48.320
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2280
01:28:48.350 --> 01:28:50.900
<v Speaker 2>but anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not where we're at.</v>

2281
01:28:50.901 --> 01:28:52.850
<v Speaker 2>We're at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody stands around screaming at the</v>

2282
01:28:52.851 --> 01:28:55.010
<v Speaker 2>sky because they're upset about one side</v>
<v Speaker 2>or the other.</v>

2283
01:28:55.040 --> 01:28:57.260
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crap doesn't get done.</v>

2284
01:28:57.560 --> 01:28:59.120
<v Speaker 2>How much time do you spend thinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about this?</v>

2296
01:29:19.180 --> 01:29:20.040
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2297
01:29:20.700 --> 01:29:22.020
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I spend,</v>

2298
01:29:22.021 --> 01:29:24.570
<v Speaker 2>I probably spend more time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a lot of friends,</v>

2299
01:29:27.560 --> 01:29:29.170
<v Speaker 2>so I invite you to go fishing.</v>

<v Speaker 2>We'll just sit around and say it like it</v>

2302
01:29:33.301 --> 01:29:34.134
<v Speaker 2>was good fishing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he only wanted to do was talk about </v>

2303
01:29:35.071 --> 01:29:37.080
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ron fucking boring.</v>

2304
01:29:37.890 --> 01:29:39.200
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2305
01:29:39.690 --> 01:29:40.171
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2306
01:29:40.171 --> 01:29:41.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd probably spend a little more time,</v>

2307
01:29:41.701 --> 01:29:43.710
<v Speaker 2>but I will tell you what's fun is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it,</v>

2308
01:29:43.770 --> 01:29:45.060
<v Speaker 2>some of it does rub off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2309
01:29:45.061 --> 01:29:47.090
<v Speaker 2>Like my three little guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2310
01:29:47.150 --> 01:29:49.490
<v Speaker 2>or even my daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she loves international fair.</v>

2311
01:29:49.491 --> 01:29:52.500
<v Speaker 2>She loves international relations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what's going on in the world.</v>

2312
01:29:52.501 --> 01:29:54.150
<v Speaker 2>She travels a lot and I think that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

2313
01:29:54.150 --> 01:29:55.650
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So maybe some of that rubbed off,</v>

2314
01:29:55.651 --> 01:29:56.484
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sitting around the dinner table and </v>

2315
01:29:56.761 --> 01:29:57.594
<v Speaker 2>talking about these things or me banging</v>
<v Speaker 2>on about it and I thought every now and </v>

2316
01:29:59.701 --> 01:30:00.534
<v Speaker 2>then I think I'm being boring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But maybe they picked up on something </v>

2317
01:30:02.161 --> 01:30:04.350
<v Speaker 2>and sometimes my kids will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will say something,</v>

2318
01:30:04.380 --> 01:30:05.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they'll like,</v>

2319
01:30:06.050 --> 01:30:08.170
<v Speaker 2>like scooter the oldest one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's wanting me it shit.</v>

2320
01:30:08.171 --> 01:30:10.030
<v Speaker 2>He's only 10 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2321
01:30:10.200 --> 01:30:12.990
<v Speaker 2>the governor came in or a governor </v>
<v Speaker 2>candidate can make,</v>

2322
01:30:12.991 --> 01:30:14.310
<v Speaker 2>cause we're coming up on an election </v>
<v Speaker 2>cycle.</v>

2323
01:30:15.140 --> 01:30:17.630
<v Speaker 2>A governor candidate came in and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy,</v>

2324
01:30:17.690 --> 01:30:18.270
<v Speaker 2>we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2325
01:30:18.270 --> 01:30:19.103
<v Speaker 2>nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he came in and to talk to Her ben's </v>

2326
01:30:20.341 --> 01:30:21.121
<v Speaker 2>class,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2327
01:30:21.121 --> 01:30:23.240
<v Speaker 2>Fifth Grade Class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

2328
01:30:23.430 --> 01:30:26.850
<v Speaker 2>ben raised his hand during the question </v>
<v Speaker 2>period and said,</v>

2329
01:30:27.060 --> 01:30:27.893
<v Speaker 2>so what would you do differently?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because Idaho was ranked 43rd in </v>

2330
01:30:30.811 --> 01:30:31.644
<v Speaker 2>education.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I know he said this because this </v>

2331
01:30:33.781 --> 01:30:35.100
<v Speaker 2>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they called me later and he says,</v>

2332
01:30:35.430 --> 01:30:36.630
<v Speaker 2>your kid has his question.</v>

2333
01:30:37.890 --> 01:30:38.980
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was going to say,</v>

2334
01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:39.440
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on.</v>

2335
01:30:39.440 --> 01:30:41.130
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we want more homework.</v>

2336
01:30:41.131 --> 01:30:41.964
<v Speaker 2>Lighten up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2337
01:30:42.330 --> 01:30:44.160
<v Speaker 2>Give us more homework.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

2338
01:30:44.161 --> 01:30:45.390
<v Speaker 2>the point being is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is you know,</v>

2339
01:30:45.420 --> 01:30:46.730
<v Speaker 2>my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2340
01:30:46.740 --> 01:30:49.000
<v Speaker 2>the world's greatest person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2341
01:30:49.110 --> 01:30:49.943
<v Speaker 2>is in politics and focused and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>strategy and campaign problems and all </v>

2342
01:30:53.611 --> 01:30:55.350
<v Speaker 2>sorts of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she talks about it as well.</v>

2343
01:30:55.351 --> 01:30:57.150
<v Speaker 2>So maybe the kids absorb something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2344
01:30:57.330 --> 01:30:59.370
<v Speaker 2>And maybe if you talk about these things</v>
<v Speaker 2>at home,</v>

2345
01:30:59.550 --> 01:31:00.660
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not rocket science,</v>

2346
01:31:00.661 --> 01:31:02.220
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But maybe you talk about these things at</v>

2347
01:31:02.221 --> 01:31:03.900
<v Speaker 2>home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe the kids do pick up on some of it.</v>

2348
01:31:03.901 --> 01:31:04.734
<v Speaker 2>Are they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they start to imagine that there's </v>

2349
01:31:05.610 --> 01:31:07.380
<v Speaker 2>something else other than just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2350
01:31:07.381 --> 01:31:08.880
<v Speaker 2>what happens on the school yard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2351
01:31:08.940 --> 01:31:09.780
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

2352
01:31:09.781 --> 01:31:10.614
<v Speaker 2>So I guess there's an upside to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know where I'm going with that </v>

2353
01:31:13.110 --> 01:31:14.610
<v Speaker 2>to look on like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

2354
01:31:15.370 --> 01:31:17.640
<v Speaker 2>this is certainly an upside to talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about things.</v>

2355
01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:20.820
<v Speaker 2>And the more kids know now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the better it is.</v>

2356
01:31:21.240 --> 01:31:22.650
<v Speaker 2>But we don't teach civics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2357
01:31:22.680 --> 01:31:24.510
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't teach civics in school that the</v>

2358
01:31:24.511 --> 01:31:27.360
<v Speaker 2>workings of government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how the government is supposed to work.</v>

2359
01:31:27.390 --> 01:31:28.223
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most people get out of high school and </v>

2360
01:31:28.891 --> 01:31:29.724
<v Speaker 2>they barely understand what's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>difference between the Congress and the </v>

2361
01:31:31.051 --> 01:31:32.310
<v Speaker 2>Senate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2362
01:31:32.311 --> 01:31:33.780
<v Speaker 2>And so then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you get what we get,</v>

2363
01:31:33.781 --> 01:31:34.614
<v Speaker 2>which is people reading crap on twitter </v>
<v Speaker 2>and thinking that it's always true or </v>

2364
01:31:38.731 --> 01:31:41.220
<v Speaker 2>that's how they formed their opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or it's all this,</v>

2365
01:31:41.221 --> 01:31:42.054
<v Speaker 2>or it's all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The world is not that the world exists </v>

2366
01:31:43.440 --> 01:31:44.940
<v Speaker 2>somewhere in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the middle ground.</v>

2367
01:31:45.210 --> 01:31:46.940
<v Speaker 2>But we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't,</v>

2368
01:31:47.040 --> 01:31:47.701
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2369
01:31:47.701 --> 01:31:48.121
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

2370
01:31:48.121 --> 01:31:50.460
<v Speaker 2>we're failing our kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2371
01:31:50.970 --> 01:31:54.510
<v Speaker 2>by a desire to make life easier for </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

2372
01:31:54.511 --> 01:31:55.344
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2373
01:31:55.560 --> 01:31:57.390
<v Speaker 2>I think there's definitely some truth to</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2374
01:31:57.930 --> 01:31:59.470
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2375
01:31:59.500 --> 01:32:00.333
<v Speaker 2>I think</v>

2376
01:32:00.990 --> 01:32:05.990
<v Speaker 3>there's a shocking lack of adversary or </v>
<v Speaker 3>adversity rather,</v>

2377
01:32:06.461 --> 01:32:09.370
<v Speaker 3>that a lot of people have to go through </v>
<v Speaker 3>in this life.</v>

2378
01:32:10.090 --> 01:32:10.923
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2379
01:32:11.050 --> 01:32:14.290
<v Speaker 3>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go through too much soft living,</v>

2380
01:32:14.890 --> 01:32:19.210
<v Speaker 3>you start to develop these lazy habits </v>
<v Speaker 3>and this distorted perception of reality</v>

2381
01:32:19.570 --> 01:32:20.403
<v Speaker 3>and a lack of understanding of what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what really hard work is and how </v>

2382
01:32:24.671 --> 01:32:25.504
<v Speaker 3>difficult it is to get by in this life </v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't live in this cushy place </v>

2383
01:32:29.171 --> 01:32:30.120
<v Speaker 3>that we live in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2384
01:32:30.160 --> 01:32:32.530
<v Speaker 3>Did you work when you were a kid?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you work summer jobs?</v>

2385
01:32:32.570 --> 01:32:33.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2386
01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:35.860
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of construction jobs mostly.</v>

2387
01:32:36.630 --> 01:32:38.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the same thing when we,</v>

2388
01:32:38.061 --> 01:32:38.521
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2389

2390
01:32:41.010 --> 01:32:42.010
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

2391
01:32:43.610 --> 01:32:44.600
<v Speaker 2>it's a good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2392
01:32:44.610 --> 01:32:45.550
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know what?</v>

2394
01:32:47.281 --> 01:32:48.450
<v Speaker 2>At the end of the day you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>exhausted.</v>

2395
01:32:48.451 --> 01:32:49.530
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2396

<v Speaker 2>It's time for him to do something and </v>

<v Speaker 2>So he's talking make a mow lawns at 11.</v>

2403
01:33:00.090 --> 01:33:01.240
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2404
01:33:01.241 --> 01:33:03.480
<v Speaker 2>You could have mowed lawns this year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2405
01:33:03.660 --> 01:33:05.910
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2406
01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.580
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it seems early that early to push</v>

2407
01:33:08.581 --> 01:33:09.710
<v Speaker 2>a lawn mower.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not,</v>

2408
01:33:10.110 --> 01:33:12.120
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have a lawnmower job when I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>11.</v>

2409
01:33:12.210 --> 01:33:13.170
<v Speaker 2>That seems early.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2410
01:33:13.171 --> 01:33:14.130
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>

2411
01:33:14.131 --> 01:33:14.964
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you tell them where not to put their </v>

2412
01:33:15.511 --> 01:33:16.620
<v Speaker 2>feet in their hands and their gut.</v>

2413
01:33:16.680 --> 01:33:21.150
<v Speaker 2>Let the little fella have a life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get them involved in sports.</v>

2414
01:33:22.270 --> 01:33:23.910
<v Speaker 2>They don't play,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll play a lot of lacrosse.</v>

2415
01:33:23.911 --> 01:33:25.950
<v Speaker 2>They play a lot of basketball.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They shovel snow yet.</v>

2416
01:33:25.951 --> 01:33:26.671
<v Speaker 2>Swim team.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2417
01:33:26.671 --> 01:33:28.500
<v Speaker 2>They shovel snow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get out there and the 10 year old,</v>

2418
01:33:28.501 --> 01:33:31.020
<v Speaker 2>the eight year olds a shovel snow during</v>
<v Speaker 2>the winter,</v>

2419
01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:33.180
<v Speaker 2>a six year olds like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2420
01:33:33.181 --> 01:33:34.170
<v Speaker 2>mugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not doing a lot.</v>

2421
01:33:34.171 --> 01:33:38.460
<v Speaker 2>Got figure out a way out of this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's going to be management.</v>

2422
01:33:38.490 --> 01:33:41.340
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what he's gonna do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's going to be management somehow.</v>

2423
01:33:41.590 --> 01:33:42.780
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

2424
01:33:42.781 --> 01:33:43.790
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2425
01:33:43.830 --> 01:33:44.850
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the work ethic.</v>

2426
01:33:44.880 --> 01:33:46.910
<v Speaker 2>I think you're absolutely right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we every,</v>

2427
01:33:48.720 --> 01:33:49.030
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2428
01:33:49.030 --> 01:33:49.960
<v Speaker 2>every generation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2429
01:33:49.961 --> 01:33:52.270
<v Speaker 2>Like my parents wanted it to be easier </v>
<v Speaker 2>for me and my brothers,</v>

2430
01:33:52.300 --> 01:33:55.000
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And their parents I'm sure want it to be</v>

2431
01:33:55.001 --> 01:33:56.080
<v Speaker 2>easier for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2432
01:33:56.081 --> 01:33:57.340
<v Speaker 2>And nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so you do that,</v>

2433
01:33:57.341 --> 01:33:58.174
<v Speaker 2>but eventually you get to diminishing </v>
<v Speaker 2>returns because it becomes so easy and </v>

2434
01:34:03.150 --> 01:34:05.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the kids forget what it is.</v>

2435
01:34:05.201 --> 01:34:06.034
<v Speaker 2>Like to actually have to work for </v>
<v Speaker 2>something and to compete and to compete </v>

2436
01:34:09.761 --> 01:34:10.571
<v Speaker 2>and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can't all,</v>

2437
01:34:10.571 --> 01:34:13.150
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like that I saw some story,</v>

2438
01:34:13.151 --> 01:34:15.070
<v Speaker 2>not that I troll them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the social media,</v>

2439
01:34:15.071 --> 01:34:18.880
<v Speaker 2>but there was a story that popped up </v>
<v Speaker 2>that some community,</v>

2440
01:34:19.060 --> 01:34:19.893
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had a cheer squad try out and one </v>

2441
01:34:22.451 --> 01:34:24.700
<v Speaker 2>of the girls didn't make it on cheer </v>
<v Speaker 2>squad.</v>

2442
01:34:24.701 --> 01:34:27.880
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even know what cheer squad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess the cheerleaders and the mom was</v>

2443
01:34:27.881 --> 01:34:28.714
<v Speaker 2>upset and so she went and complained.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the school decision was that </v>

2444
01:34:32.410 --> 01:34:35.290
<v Speaker 2>everybody who tried out gets to be on </v>
<v Speaker 2>this squad.</v>

2445
01:34:36.190 --> 01:34:37.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can imagine what that looks like.</v>

2446
01:34:42.080 --> 01:34:46.490
<v Speaker 3>You got to teach kids the opposite,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that if you didn't do good enough,</v>

2447
01:34:46.520 --> 01:34:47.353
<v Speaker 3>you need to figure out what you did </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong and go back and improve and work </v>

2448
01:34:49.881 --> 01:34:52.130
<v Speaker 3>on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then if you do get in next year,</v>

2449
01:34:52.280 --> 01:34:53.113
<v Speaker 3>you'll get an amazing feeling of </v>
<v Speaker 3>accomplishment rather than an amazing </v>

2450
01:34:55.580 --> 01:34:57.260
<v Speaker 3>feeling of entitlement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2451
01:34:57.290 --> 01:34:58.123
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you belong in everything you try out </v>

2452
01:34:59.721 --> 01:35:00.320
<v Speaker 3>for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2453
01:35:00.320 --> 01:35:04.390
<v Speaker 3>that's going to be a big fat wake up </v>
<v Speaker 3>call when you go out to compete</v>

2454
01:35:04.450 --> 01:35:05.500
<v Speaker 2>the workforce.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2455
01:35:05.530 --> 01:35:07.060
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's going to chow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My God.</v>

2456
01:35:07.061 --> 01:35:08.560
<v Speaker 2>Nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's going to cut you any slack.</v>

2457
01:35:08.561 --> 01:35:10.160
<v Speaker 2>Theoretical fully.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2458
01:35:10.450 --> 01:35:11.170
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

2459
01:35:11.170 --> 01:35:11.891
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

2460
01:35:11.891 --> 01:35:14.050
<v Speaker 2>The idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2461
01:35:14.051 --> 01:35:15.770
<v Speaker 2>you got to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like my,</v>

2462
01:35:15.970 --> 01:35:18.620
<v Speaker 2>my two older boys or if people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking,</v>

2463
01:35:18.630 --> 01:35:19.463
<v Speaker 2>oh gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mike's now talking about his kids all </v>

2464
01:35:20.741 --> 01:35:21.574
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2465
01:35:21.640 --> 01:35:23.920
<v Speaker 2>my two little boys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have gotten to the point now where the</v>

2466
01:35:23.921 --> 01:35:27.190
<v Speaker 2>sports thing they play and if they don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>play well,</v>

2467
01:35:27.220 --> 01:35:29.830
<v Speaker 2>they sit right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because earlier than that,</v>

2468
01:35:30.070 --> 01:35:31.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody plays right.</v>

2469
01:35:31.091 --> 01:35:32.050
<v Speaker 2>It's equal playing time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2470
01:35:32.051 --> 01:35:34.360
<v Speaker 2>that's what you typically get the </v>
<v Speaker 2>coaches here and that's a good thing.</v>

2471
01:35:34.361 --> 01:35:35.194
<v Speaker 2>They little kids are learning how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>play the game of where to stand and all </v>

2472
01:35:36.851 --> 01:35:37.990
<v Speaker 2>the rest of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2473
01:35:38.230 --> 01:35:39.063
<v Speaker 2>but then they get to a certain point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it becomes merit based or it should </v>

2474
01:35:40.870 --> 01:35:41.703
<v Speaker 2>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is how it works in Idaho </v>

2475
01:35:42.431 --> 01:35:42.970
<v Speaker 2>basically.</v>

2476
01:35:42.970 --> 01:35:45.370
<v Speaker 2>At least with the teams that were we </v>
<v Speaker 2>were associated with.</v>

2477
01:35:45.580 --> 01:35:46.091
<v Speaker 2>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>

2478
01:35:46.091 --> 01:35:49.000
<v Speaker 2>if you don't play that well then maybe </v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't make the team.</v>

2479
01:35:49.001 --> 01:35:49.834
<v Speaker 2>And if you make the team and you're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>playing as well as the other kids and </v>

2480
01:35:50.981 --> 01:35:53.590
<v Speaker 2>you're sitting on the bench.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you know,</v>

2481
01:35:53.591 --> 01:35:54.440
<v Speaker 2>my kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2482
01:35:54.441 --> 01:35:56.500
<v Speaker 2>when it first started happening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2483
01:35:56.501 --> 01:35:58.120
<v Speaker 2>they were just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were complaining,</v>

2484
01:35:58.150 --> 01:35:58.983
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2485
01:35:59.380 --> 01:36:00.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>screw it,</v>

2486
01:36:00.311 --> 01:36:01.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm not getting any playing time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm thinking,</v>

2487
01:36:01.691 --> 01:36:02.291
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2488
01:36:02.291 --> 01:36:03.124
<v Speaker 2>what's the next part of that thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>process that you need to work your way </v>

2489
01:36:04.901 --> 01:36:05.734
<v Speaker 2>through?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're not getting enough playing </v>

2490
01:36:06.761 --> 01:36:09.250
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's because you're not what planning as</v>

2491
01:36:09.251 --> 01:36:12.640
<v Speaker 2>well as you should be compared to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other kids.</v>

2492
01:36:12.641 --> 01:36:13.900
<v Speaker 2>Therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you need to do?</v>

2493
01:36:13.960 --> 01:36:15.730
<v Speaker 2>So you have to walk them through this </v>
<v Speaker 2>process.</v>

2494
01:36:15.731 --> 01:36:18.280
<v Speaker 2>And that's okay because kids don't know </v>
<v Speaker 2>this stuff inherently.</v>

2495
01:36:18.281 --> 01:36:20.800
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you teach them that,</v>

2496
01:36:21.040 --> 01:36:22.530
<v Speaker 2>but you don't teach them that while </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2497
01:36:22.531 --> 01:36:23.364
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you try a different sport or </v>

2498
01:36:24.790 --> 01:36:25.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you're right,</v>

2499
01:36:25.950 --> 01:36:27.670
<v Speaker 2>we should talk to the coach about your </v>
<v Speaker 2>characters.</v>

2500
01:36:28.260 --> 01:36:31.780
<v Speaker 3>You too difficult for the children and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not having a good time.</v>

2501
01:36:31.900 --> 01:36:35.710
<v Speaker 3>And it should be about companionship and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it shouldn't be about competition.</v>

2502
01:36:36.370 --> 01:36:37.203
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're setting your kid up for failure </v>

2503
01:36:38.530 --> 01:36:41.680
<v Speaker 3>because it can be about both.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could be about companionship,</v>

2504
01:36:41.890 --> 01:36:43.610
<v Speaker 3>but also about competition and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2505
01:36:44.200 --> 01:36:46.660
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world's competition,</v>

2506
01:36:46.661 --> 01:36:48.490
<v Speaker 3>it's filled with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're not competing,</v>

2507
01:36:48.520 --> 01:36:49.353
<v Speaker 3>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you just decide you don't want to </v>

2508
01:36:50.591 --> 01:36:52.960
<v Speaker 3>have anything to do with competition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's your choice.</v>

2509
01:36:53.170 --> 01:36:56.440
<v Speaker 3>But if you engage in something that does</v>
<v Speaker 3>require competition,</v>

2510
01:36:56.441 --> 01:36:58.540
<v Speaker 3>you want special access.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

2511
01:36:58.541 --> 01:36:58.750
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

2512
01:36:58.750 --> 01:36:59.560
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2513
01:36:59.560 --> 01:37:00.241
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>

2514
01:37:00.241 --> 01:37:01.740
<v Speaker 2>if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're not that nature,</v>

2515
01:37:02.100 --> 01:37:04.890
<v Speaker 2>if you don't have that competitive side </v>
<v Speaker 2>of you and okay,</v>

2516
01:37:04.891 --> 01:37:05.724
<v Speaker 2>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then don't go through the rest of </v>

2517
01:37:06.781 --> 01:37:07.710
<v Speaker 2>life thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll just,</v>

2518
01:37:07.711 --> 01:37:10.540
<v Speaker 2>because life is a competition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you know,</v>

2519
01:37:10.570 --> 01:37:11.403
<v Speaker 2>may upset you when you find that out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you don't get special dispensation </v>

2520
01:37:14.101 --> 01:37:15.720
<v Speaker 2>just because you're not a competitive </v>
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>

2521
01:37:15.721 --> 01:37:16.181
<v Speaker 2>It does it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2522
01:37:16.181 --> 01:37:18.720
<v Speaker 2>So I agree with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Participation Trophies,</v>

2523
01:37:19.100 --> 01:37:21.540
<v Speaker 2>all the nonsense that's going on today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2524
01:37:21.541 --> 01:37:22.141
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

2525
01:37:22.141 --> 01:37:23.160
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was walking,</v>

2526
01:37:23.161 --> 01:37:24.570
<v Speaker 2>one of my boys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they all just went off the,</v>

2527
01:37:24.571 --> 01:37:27.510
<v Speaker 2>off the lacrosse field not too long ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

2528
01:37:27.511 --> 01:37:30.120
<v Speaker 2>how'd I do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

2529
01:37:30.121 --> 01:37:32.520
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could've done better.</v>

2530
01:37:32.730 --> 01:37:34.890
<v Speaker 2>You could have played harder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just wasn't into it.</v>

2531
01:37:34.891 --> 01:37:36.120
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was tired or whatever.</v>

2532
01:37:36.990 --> 01:37:37.823
<v Speaker 2>So he kind of looked at me and I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>realize I was walking and there were </v>

2533
01:37:40.111 --> 01:37:42.570
<v Speaker 2>some parents around me and as we were </v>
<v Speaker 2>walking across the field,</v>

2534
01:37:42.571 --> 01:37:45.270
<v Speaker 2>and so he kind of looks at me and I knew</v>
<v Speaker 2>what he was thinking,</v>

2535
01:37:45.271 --> 01:37:47.250
<v Speaker 2>which is Dan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not right.</v>

2536
01:37:48.030 --> 01:37:48.930
<v Speaker 2>And so I looked at her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

2537
01:37:48.931 --> 01:37:49.764
<v Speaker 2>do you want me to be honest with you and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want me to just stand here and blow </v>

2538
01:37:51.811 --> 01:37:52.644
<v Speaker 2>smoke up your ass?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I found out did a couple of parents </v>

2539
01:37:56.071 --> 01:37:57.570
<v Speaker 2>who were upset about the fact that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>would say that,</v>

2540
01:37:57.720 --> 01:37:59.580
<v Speaker 2>but he knew exactly what I meant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

2541
01:37:59.581 --> 01:38:00.414
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should be honest.</v>

2542
01:38:00.690 --> 01:38:01.141
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2543
01:38:01.141 --> 01:38:01.974
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the parents were upset at you for being </v>

2544
01:38:02.821 --> 01:38:03.654
<v Speaker 2>honest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2545
01:38:03.780 --> 01:38:04.470
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

2546
01:38:04.470 --> 01:38:05.460
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

2547
01:38:05.461 --> 01:38:06.294
<v Speaker 2>to be fair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>muggsy the youngest one got called in </v>

2548
01:38:07.681 --> 01:38:08.514
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2549
01:38:08.970 --> 01:38:10.760
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done,</v>

2550
01:38:10.790 --> 01:38:11.623
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got called a fuse in the word Douche </v>

2551
01:38:12.631 --> 01:38:14.340
<v Speaker 2>bag one time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a funnier,</v>

2552
01:38:14.750 --> 01:38:18.510
<v Speaker 2>funnier one was when he and two of his </v>
<v Speaker 2>buddies who shall not be named,</v>

2553
01:38:18.511 --> 01:38:21.960
<v Speaker 2>we're out in the playground not too long</v>
<v Speaker 2>ago and there were sitting down in,</v>

2554
01:38:21.961 --> 01:38:22.910
<v Speaker 2>they're playing some game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2555
01:38:22.920 --> 01:38:23.753
<v Speaker 2>It was recess and all the kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the different grades are out there </v>

2556
01:38:25.260 --> 01:38:27.720
<v Speaker 2>running around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And everybody knows my little kid,</v>

2557
01:38:27.750 --> 01:38:29.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mugsy he's like the mayor of the town.</v>

2558
01:38:29.431 --> 01:38:30.930
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's just a jolly happy guy.</v>

2559
01:38:30.931 --> 01:38:31.560
<v Speaker 2>He's got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got to,</v>

2560
01:38:31.560 --> 01:38:33.750
<v Speaker 2>he's going to be the guy that takes 10 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years to get out of college.</v>

2561
01:38:33.780 --> 01:38:35.960
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he,</v>

2562
01:38:36.020 --> 01:38:37.380
<v Speaker 2>he and his two little buddies are </v>
<v Speaker 2>sitting there.</v>

2563
01:38:37.381 --> 01:38:39.480
<v Speaker 2>They're playing some game where they got</v>
<v Speaker 2>to count with their fingers.</v>

2564
01:38:39.750 --> 01:38:42.630
<v Speaker 2>So at one point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jack has the number one knee and he puts</v>

2565
01:38:42.631 --> 01:38:43.464
<v Speaker 2>up a finger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2566
01:38:43.770 --> 01:38:44.603
<v Speaker 2>And one of the other kids starts </v>
<v Speaker 2>laughing and cause he's got an older </v>

2567
01:38:47.641 --> 01:38:50.070
<v Speaker 2>brother who told them what it means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he tells me what it means.</v>

2568
01:38:50.071 --> 01:38:51.530
<v Speaker 2>So they start shouting this out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2569
01:38:52.220 --> 01:38:53.670
<v Speaker 2>And this word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they start shouting and,</v>

2570
01:38:53.671 --> 01:38:55.300
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a couple of the older kids walk by,</v>

2571
01:38:55.301 --> 01:38:56.630
<v Speaker 2>any here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

2572
01:38:56.640 --> 01:38:58.660
<v Speaker 2>these three kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six years old.</v>

2573
01:38:58.660 --> 01:39:00.090
<v Speaker 2>She's yelling this way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>laughing.</v>

2574
01:39:00.110 --> 01:39:00.943
<v Speaker 2>Uproariously cause they think it's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>funniest fucking thing they've ever </v>

2575
01:39:02.401 --> 01:39:03.234
<v Speaker 2>heard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they get called into the </v>

2576
01:39:05.191 --> 01:39:07.410
<v Speaker 2>principal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well what happens next?</v>

2577
01:39:07.620 --> 01:39:09.060
<v Speaker 2>I have to find out about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2578
01:39:09.061 --> 01:39:12.230
<v Speaker 2>So now they notify the parents and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

2579
01:39:12.280 --> 01:39:13.650
<v Speaker 2>admittedly the principal's laughing when</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2580
01:39:13.740 --> 01:39:14.573
<v Speaker 2>when they're telling you the story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But now I have to have a conversation </v>

2581
01:39:16.381 --> 01:39:17.670
<v Speaker 2>with mugsy when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I come home.</v>

2582
01:39:17.850 --> 01:39:20.100
<v Speaker 2>So I come home and I said much anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened today?</v>

2583
01:39:20.101 --> 01:39:20.631
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nah,</v>

2584
01:39:20.631 --> 01:39:22.830
<v Speaker 2>that didn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And me walked right by me and I said,</v>

2585
01:39:22.831 --> 01:39:23.131
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

2586
01:39:23.131 --> 01:39:23.641
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come back here.</v>

2587
01:39:23.641 --> 01:39:25.170
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you get called into the principal's?</v>

2588
01:39:25.171 --> 01:39:27.060
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah.</v>

2589
01:39:27.270 --> 01:39:28.380
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were,</v>

2590
01:39:28.410 --> 01:39:29.243
<v Speaker 2>let me see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were playing on the playground and I </v>

2591
01:39:30.871 --> 01:39:33.300
<v Speaker 2>went like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know what this means?</v>

2592
01:39:35.130 --> 01:39:36.330
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2593
01:39:36.420 --> 01:39:37.500
<v Speaker 2>I don't need to know.</v>

2594
01:39:37.500 --> 01:39:39.840
<v Speaker 2>And I look out of the corner of my eye,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see his two older brothers,</v>

2595
01:39:39.990 --> 01:39:42.690
<v Speaker 2>like around the corner just waiting </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they know he's gonna get his ass</v>

2596
01:39:42.691 --> 01:39:43.650
<v Speaker 2>kicked right for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for this.</v>

2597
01:39:43.830 --> 01:39:45.390
<v Speaker 2>And they're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can't wait.</v>

2598
01:39:45.750 --> 01:39:47.070
<v Speaker 2>And so I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>

2599
01:39:47.071 --> 01:39:49.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't need to know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just don't do it again.</v>

2600
01:39:49.500 --> 01:39:51.270
<v Speaker 2>Whatever you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't do it again.</v>

2601
01:39:51.480 --> 01:39:51.991
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2602
01:39:51.991 --> 01:39:52.321
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2603
01:39:52.321 --> 01:39:54.000
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to know what this means.</v>

2604
01:39:54.540 --> 01:39:56.700
<v Speaker 2>He's really intent on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I said,</v>

2605
01:39:56.970 --> 01:39:58.440
<v Speaker 2>and he's two other boys skirts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

2606
01:39:58.441 --> 01:39:59.580
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2607
01:39:59.581 --> 01:40:02.040
<v Speaker 2>he's going to get so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

2608
01:40:02.041 --> 01:40:02.880
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does it mean?</v>

2609
01:40:03.150 --> 01:40:05.760
<v Speaker 2>And I had no idea what he was going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>say.</v>

2610
01:40:05.790 --> 01:40:10.790
<v Speaker 2>But what he did say was mother Fucker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's what they were yelling on the</v>

2611
01:40:11.791 --> 01:40:12.624
<v Speaker 2>playground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All three of them at the top of their </v>

2612
01:40:14.971 --> 01:40:18.480
<v Speaker 2>lungs Gel and no mother fuckers six </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's six years old.</v>

2613
01:40:18.480 --> 01:40:20.850
<v Speaker 2>That's a door.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I started laughing and the two other</v>

2614
01:40:20.851 --> 01:40:22.800
<v Speaker 2>boys walked away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>disgusted that I was laughing.</v>

2615
01:40:22.950 --> 01:40:26.820
<v Speaker 2>And that's the end of my story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're great kids.</v>

2616
01:40:27.450 --> 01:40:29.970
<v Speaker 2>So how do you take that gene?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You put it back in the bottle,</v>

2617
01:40:30.080 --> 01:40:31.140
<v Speaker 2>do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>screaming motherfucker.</v>

2619
01:40:35.020 --> 01:40:38.190
<v Speaker 2>And there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's not much you can do.</v>

2620
01:40:38.690 --> 01:40:41.130
<v Speaker 2>Lee throwing their finger up in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to do.</v>

2621
01:40:41.131 --> 01:40:42.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find myself having to constantly catch</v>

2622
01:40:42.751 --> 01:40:43.301
<v Speaker 2>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>

2623
01:40:43.301 --> 01:40:44.340
<v Speaker 2>I'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I probably shouldn't say that,</v>

2627
01:40:49.050 --> 01:40:49.883
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2628
01:40:49.890 --> 01:40:51.630
<v Speaker 2>but that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't get,</v>

01:40:51.660 --> 01:40:53.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my dad was the guy I've ever known in my</v>

2630
01:40:53.861 --> 01:40:55.760
<v Speaker 2>life and he swore and I'd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd,</v>

2631
01:40:55.780 --> 01:40:57.820
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it didn't scare me in any way.</v>

2632
01:40:57.840 --> 01:40:58.920
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a problem with it.</v>

2633
01:40:58.921 --> 01:41:01.110
<v Speaker 1>It's part of what I do for a living.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when I was,</v>

2634
01:41:01.111 --> 01:41:03.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I wa I was,</v>

2635
01:41:03.250 --> 01:41:05.220
<v Speaker 1>we were in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were skiing with my,</v>

2636
01:41:05.221 --> 01:41:07.850
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>youngest daughter who was three and a,</v>

2637
01:41:07.870 --> 01:41:08.703
<v Speaker 1>we're packing up the stuff and she </v>
<v Speaker 1>forgot to pack her helmet and a helmet </v>

2638
01:41:12.961 --> 01:41:15.750
<v Speaker 1>wasn't packed and the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she looks down at her luggage.</v>

2639
01:41:15.751 --> 01:41:18.220
<v Speaker 1>She looks down at the helm and she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit,</v>

2640
01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:24.360
<v Speaker 1>this is something adorable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But she was three at the time,</v>

2641
01:41:24.420 --> 01:41:28.170
<v Speaker 1>about a three year old sage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see if you could get together with</v>

2642
01:41:28.171 --> 01:41:29.004
<v Speaker 1>mugsy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then she could have said Shit and you </v>

2643
01:41:30.271 --> 01:41:31.470
<v Speaker 1>could just say what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she just said,</v>

2644
01:41:31.471 --> 01:41:36.471
<v Speaker 1>I forgot my mother fucking helmet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then she's got a completely sentenced.</v>

2645
01:41:38.910 --> 01:41:40.170
<v Speaker 1>Gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2646
01:41:40.190 --> 01:41:42.300
<v Speaker 1>there's something really cute about </v>
<v Speaker 1>kid's swearing.</v>

2647
01:41:42.830 --> 01:41:45.060
<v Speaker 1>It's just adorable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We tried to tell him,</v>

2648
01:41:45.061 --> 01:41:45.661
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

2649
01:41:45.661 --> 01:41:46.440
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2650
01:41:46.440 --> 01:41:48.540
<v Speaker 1>we try to teach them the basics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't swear.</v>

2651
01:41:48.541 --> 01:41:50.820
<v Speaker 1>If you can have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem is they're going to,</v>

2652
01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:55.590
<v Speaker 1>it seems so attractive to do because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not supposed to do it.</v>

2653
01:41:55.591 --> 01:41:56.550
<v Speaker 1>And when no one's around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2654
01:41:56.551 --> 01:41:57.384
<v Speaker 1>you know what I heard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember I found a new word starts </v>

2655
01:41:58.801 --> 01:41:59.670
<v Speaker 1>with a C.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2656
01:41:59.800 --> 01:42:00.310
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2657
01:42:00.310 --> 01:42:01.830
<v Speaker 1>they're doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2658
01:42:01.990 --> 01:42:02.823
<v Speaker 1>That one</v>

2659
01:42:06.370 --> 01:42:08.170
<v Speaker 2>we learned everything we learned from </v>
<v Speaker 2>older brothers.</v>

2660
01:42:08.171 --> 01:42:09.004
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or from friends who had older brothers </v>

2661
01:42:10.060 --> 01:42:11.230
<v Speaker 2>then talking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it was a,</v>

2662
01:42:11.231 --> 01:42:12.600
<v Speaker 2>it was a slower process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2663
01:42:12.830 --> 01:42:14.710
<v Speaker 2>Partly because we didn't have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>internet and all that crap.</v>

2664
01:42:14.760 --> 01:42:15.593
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I think of what you learned a </v>

2665
01:42:16.811 --> 01:42:18.460
<v Speaker 2>lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It took a little bit longer,</v>

2666
01:42:18.620 --> 01:42:19.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to learn.</v>

2667
01:42:19.540 --> 01:42:20.373
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I've really rolled out </v>

2668
01:42:20.861 --> 01:42:23.350
<v Speaker 2>douchebag till I was probably 12,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe 13.</v>

2669
01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:25.070
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were talking yesterday,</v>

2670
01:42:25.071 --> 01:42:25.220
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

2671
01:42:25.220 --> 01:42:26.180
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2672
01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:31.240
<v Speaker 1>access to the Internet where kids see so</v>
<v Speaker 1>much more and hear so much more today.</v>

2673
01:42:31.790 --> 01:42:32.623
<v Speaker 1>Like there especially like violent </v>
<v Speaker 1>images and their access to terrible </v>

2674
01:42:36.441 --> 01:42:37.274
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's just so much that if you </v>

2675
01:42:39.471 --> 01:42:42.470
<v Speaker 1>leave a kid alone with a computer or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>phone that's online,</v>

2676
01:42:42.500 --> 01:42:43.333
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just going to find out </v>

2677
01:42:44.481 --> 01:42:47.380
<v Speaker 1>everything about the world way before </v>
<v Speaker 1>their little brains are ready.</v>

2678
01:42:47.450 --> 01:42:48.261
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't do it.</v>

2679
01:42:48.261 --> 01:42:49.280
<v Speaker 2>You've got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've gotta be,</v>

2680
01:42:49.281 --> 01:42:50.540
<v Speaker 2>you gotta lock it down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2681
01:42:50.600 --> 01:42:51.433
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a good thing they got to learn the </v>

2682
01:42:52.191 --> 01:42:53.024
<v Speaker 2>technology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unlike what I apparently what I </v>

2683
01:42:54.771 --> 01:42:55.880
<v Speaker 2>apparently did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna leave my,</v>

2684
01:42:55.960 --> 01:42:56.600
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2685
01:42:56.600 --> 01:42:58.850
<v Speaker 2>my watch here for you since I don't know</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to use it,</v>

2686
01:42:59.150 --> 01:43:01.460
<v Speaker 2>but a year are you gonna let them get </v>
<v Speaker 2>online?</v>

2687
01:43:02.080 --> 01:43:02.541
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2688
01:43:02.541 --> 01:43:04.130
<v Speaker 2>they can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can do school research,</v>

2689
01:43:04.180 --> 01:43:05.000
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They need to,</v>

2690
01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.510
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can like,</v>

2691
01:43:07.511 --> 01:43:08.140
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2692
01:43:08.140 --> 01:43:11.150
<v Speaker 2>the middle one loves basketball.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He loves basketball so he can look up,</v>

2693
01:43:11.151 --> 01:43:12.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a steph curry videos,</v>

2694
01:43:12.771 --> 01:43:14.420
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As long as they've got supervision.</v>

2695
01:43:14.450 --> 01:43:14.930
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2696
01:43:14.930 --> 01:43:17.180
<v Speaker 2>They have to have supervision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to know what they're doing.</v>

2697
01:43:18.440 --> 01:43:22.520
<v Speaker 2>But if you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause if you let them have free rein at,</v>

2698
01:43:22.521 --> 01:43:26.600
<v Speaker 2>it's a freak zone out there and they'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>find it just by accident.</v>

2699
01:43:26.870 --> 01:43:28.880
<v Speaker 2>And you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think their minds,</v>

2700
01:43:29.100 --> 01:43:29.933
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can't ask kids to process all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the crap that's out there on the </v>

2701
01:43:34.011 --> 01:43:36.110
<v Speaker 2>internet at that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at that early age.</v>

2702
01:43:36.111 --> 01:43:37.760
<v Speaker 2>It's not fair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not right.</v>

2703
01:43:37.761 --> 01:43:42.410
<v Speaker 2>And you can't tell me that there's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>some correlation between,</v>

2704
01:43:42.510 --> 01:43:43.343
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>access to all that imaging and violent </v>

2705
01:43:45.411 --> 01:43:47.750
<v Speaker 2>images and everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And some of the problems that we have in</v>

2706
01:43:47.751 --> 01:43:50.090
<v Speaker 2>the world today when we ask,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how does that kid,</v>

2707
01:43:50.120 --> 01:43:52.070
<v Speaker 2>how does he go so far off rails of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>stills</v>

2708
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:54.830
<v Speaker 1>are gone or it takes gun out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>house and shoots up a place.</v>

2709
01:43:54.920 --> 01:43:56.300
<v Speaker 1>How does that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I can't,</v>

2710
01:43:56.330 --> 01:43:57.163
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you,</v>

2711
01:43:57.600 --> 01:43:58.281
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do I,</v>

2712
01:43:58.281 --> 01:43:59.120
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a,</v>

2713
01:43:59.330 --> 01:44:01.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a psychiatrist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so people don't listen to me.</v>

2714
01:44:01.671 --> 01:44:04.880
<v Speaker 1>And take that as says medical advice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know what you're saying.</v>

2715
01:44:04.881 --> 01:44:05.714
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a reality of the world that we </v>

2716
01:44:06.591 --> 01:44:07.990
<v Speaker 1>live in and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2717
01:44:08.120 --> 01:44:10.250
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these images,</v>

2718
01:44:10.880 --> 01:44:11.713
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2719
01:44:12.770 --> 01:44:14.060
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to stop,</v>

2720
01:44:14.090 --> 01:44:14.923
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to change the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we live in by limiting the access </v>

2721
01:44:17.271 --> 01:44:18.104
<v Speaker 1>to these kids have to these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it is strange how much access we </v>

2722
01:44:21.831 --> 01:44:23.570
<v Speaker 1>have to disturb me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gay images,</v>

2723
01:44:23.571 --> 01:44:26.330
<v Speaker 1>violence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>violent videos,</v>

2724
01:44:26.331 --> 01:44:27.164
<v Speaker 1>and there's just so your brain knows </v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's out there and that there's </v>

2725
01:44:29.811 --> 01:44:30.644
<v Speaker 1>just so many more examples of it to </v>
<v Speaker 1>watch if you were 12 years old or </v>

2726
01:44:34.521 --> 01:44:35.030
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2727
01:44:35.030 --> 01:44:36.290
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the old days,</v>

2728
01:44:36.540 --> 01:44:38.990
<v Speaker 1>and maybe you found out where your dad </v>
<v Speaker 1>stored the playboys.</v>

2729
01:44:39.040 --> 01:44:40.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was it.</v>

2730
01:44:40.011 --> 01:44:40.671
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this case,</v>

2731
01:44:40.671 --> 01:44:43.130
<v Speaker 1>a cardboard box in the back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hall closet.</v>

2732
01:44:43.570 --> 01:44:44.660
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that was,</v>

2733
01:44:44.661 --> 01:44:45.291
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was it.</v>

2734
01:44:45.291 --> 01:44:47.030
<v Speaker 1>But that was how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2735
01:44:47.031 --> 01:44:48.030
<v Speaker 1>that's how you learned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2736
01:44:48.070 --> 01:44:49.430
<v Speaker 1>I never saw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2737
01:44:49.460 --> 01:44:53.240
<v Speaker 1>I saw a few altercations in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood when I was growing up,</v>

2738
01:44:53.600 --> 01:44:54.680
<v Speaker 1>but like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

2739
01:44:54.681 --> 01:44:57.170
<v Speaker 1>a real violent encounter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never saw anything.</v>

2740
01:44:57.200 --> 01:44:57.621
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2741
01:44:57.621 --> 01:44:59.610
<v Speaker 1>Shoot 'em up games now that we've got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2742
01:44:59.930 --> 01:45:02.090
<v Speaker 1>so we use that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that xbox and I talked about it.</v>

2743
01:45:02.091 --> 01:45:04.580
<v Speaker 1>It's all sports games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>

2744
01:45:04.581 --> 01:45:05.414
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole gears of war and call of duty </v>

2745
01:45:07.071 --> 01:45:08.770
<v Speaker 1>and all the rest of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2746
01:45:08.860 --> 01:45:09.980
<v Speaker 1>he can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can't do that.</v>

2747
01:45:10.550 --> 01:45:11.600
<v Speaker 1>But then again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2748
01:45:11.650 --> 01:45:12.483
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your kid will go out to his friends </v>

2749
01:45:13.911 --> 01:45:14.540
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

2750
01:45:14.540 --> 01:45:19.540
<v Speaker 1>The next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have had exploded and I don't know.</v>

2751
01:45:21.530 --> 01:45:22.490
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2752
01:45:22.491 --> 01:45:23.190
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing?</v>

2753
01:45:23.190 --> 01:45:24.250
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't protect him,</v>

2754
01:45:24.251 --> 01:45:26.180
<v Speaker 1>but you gotta you gotta do your best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2755
01:45:26.240 --> 01:45:30.350
<v Speaker 1>but the world's changing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's changing faster than we realize</v>

2756
01:45:31.040 --> 01:45:31.873
<v Speaker 1>the impact they're more aware of in </v>
<v Speaker 1>regard to the impact that it has on </v>

2757
01:45:34.971 --> 01:45:35.804
<v Speaker 1>kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think it's changing for the </v>

2758
01:45:37.311 --> 01:45:38.330
<v Speaker 1>people that are adults.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2759
01:45:38.331 --> 01:45:39.530
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world's changing.</v>

2760
01:45:39.531 --> 01:45:40.364
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's changing for that four year old </v>

2761
01:45:42.030 --> 01:45:44.090
<v Speaker 1>that's growing up in that world right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

2762
01:45:44.210 --> 01:45:47.210
<v Speaker 1>And they're going to have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the moment they get online,</v>

2763
01:45:47.360 --> 01:45:48.800
<v Speaker 1>they're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to go from,</v>

2764
01:45:48.830 --> 01:45:51.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm just a little kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>live in my little kid.</v>

2765
01:45:51.051 --> 01:45:51.884
<v Speaker 1>That's what Mommy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's my daddy to whoop the big world </v>

2766
01:45:55.070 --> 01:45:55.903
<v Speaker 1>all in one big smash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think anybody's a little </v>

2767
01:45:59.591 --> 01:46:00.424
<v Speaker 1>bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think an adult's brain is </v>

2768
01:46:01.701 --> 01:46:04.670
<v Speaker 1>designed to handle most of the shit that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have access to online.</v>

2769
01:46:04.720 --> 01:46:05.331
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2770
01:46:05.331 --> 01:46:06.830
<v Speaker 1>forget about a growing mind.</v>

2771
01:46:06.830 --> 01:46:10.490
<v Speaker 1>And what influence that has on society </v>
<v Speaker 1>is really yet to be determined.</v>

2772
01:46:10.491 --> 01:46:12.320
<v Speaker 1>What are they doing to that donkey and </v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

2773
01:46:12.470 --> 01:46:13.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2774
01:46:13.830 --> 01:46:14.663
<v Speaker 1>And I'm actually get paid for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that was a career you could </v>

2775
01:46:18.441 --> 01:46:19.910
<v Speaker 1>engage in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2776
01:46:19.940 --> 01:46:20.211
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2777
01:46:20.211 --> 01:46:22.130
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

2778
01:46:22.160 --> 01:46:23.150
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2779
01:46:23.510 --> 01:46:24.440
<v Speaker 1>I've got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

2780
01:46:24.441 --> 01:46:25.161
<v Speaker 1>I've got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got a daughter.</v>

2781
01:46:25.161 --> 01:46:26.780
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an interesting age difference.</v>

2782
01:46:26.781 --> 01:46:27.614
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what is it that's about 1213 years </v>

2783
01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:30.440
<v Speaker 1>age difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2784
01:46:30.710 --> 01:46:34.130
<v Speaker 1>And so I feel like I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a social thing there is,</v>

2785
01:46:34.220 --> 01:46:36.020
<v Speaker 1>you can study,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a case study.</v>

2786
01:46:36.290 --> 01:46:39.440
<v Speaker 1>W w what my daughter went through </v>
<v Speaker 1>growing up and access to information,</v>

2787
01:46:39.890 --> 01:46:43.170
<v Speaker 1>which was uniquely different than now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though you know,</v>

2788
01:46:43.190 --> 01:46:44.023
<v Speaker 1>she started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was really no internet or </v>

2789
01:46:45.291 --> 01:46:46.124
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then it,</v>

2790
01:46:46.270 --> 01:46:48.860
<v Speaker 1>it exploded by the time she was </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially a,</v>

2791
01:46:49.240 --> 01:46:50.030
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well the difference</v>

2792
01:46:50.030 --> 01:46:52.670
<v Speaker 3>between you and I who grew up with </v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing,</v>

2793
01:46:53.030 --> 01:46:54.290
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No Internet.</v>

2794
01:46:54.291 --> 01:46:55.124
<v Speaker 3>And then it became the Internet when </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're fully formed and as an adult and </v>

2795
01:46:58.911 --> 01:46:59.744
<v Speaker 3>then you've got a chance to see it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>even then screwed it up and made </v>

2796
01:47:02.901 --> 01:47:03.734
<v Speaker 3>mistakes and got online within God </v>
<v Speaker 3>viruses on your computer and saw some </v>

2797
01:47:06.981 --> 01:47:10.070
<v Speaker 3>stuff he really didn't want to see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Had that dial tone.</v>

2798
01:47:10.110 --> 01:47:12.200
<v Speaker 3>Remember yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dial in when you were gay</v>

2799
01:47:15.160 --> 01:47:17.630
<v Speaker 2>and then the picture would kind of come </v>
<v Speaker 2>in and little,</v>

2800
01:47:17.631 --> 01:47:18.980
<v Speaker 2>little blips.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2801
01:47:19.500 --> 01:47:22.040
<v Speaker 3>You did really want to see it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>phone?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember.</v>

01:48:15.630 --> 01:48:17.400
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't afford it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2829
01:48:17.430 --> 01:48:18.263
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't afford it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember not being able to pay for it </v>

2830
01:48:20.731 --> 01:48:22.140
<v Speaker 3>after a while.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2831
01:48:22.141 --> 01:48:23.100
<v Speaker 3>It was just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a dummy.</v>

2832
01:48:23.101 --> 01:48:25.570
<v Speaker 3>I always spent more money than I had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

2833
01:48:26.820 --> 01:48:28.710
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never been good with finances.</v>

2834
01:48:28.711 --> 01:48:29.544
<v Speaker 3>I've never been frugal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's just one of those things where </v>

2835
01:48:31.441 --> 01:48:33.030
<v Speaker 3>I realized that I could get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I got it.</v>

2836
01:48:33.280 --> 01:48:35.000
<v Speaker 2>But you remember that status you'd have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to drive around if you,</v>

2837
01:48:35.050 --> 01:48:36.290
<v Speaker 2>before that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before you had that,</v>

2838
01:48:36.291 --> 01:48:37.450
<v Speaker 2>that phone in your car,</v>

2839
01:48:39.140 --> 01:48:41.090
<v Speaker 3>you'd have to drive around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking for a public payphone.</v>

2840
01:48:41.150 --> 01:48:43.210
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you're getting your quarters right.</v>

2841
01:48:43.310 --> 01:48:45.650
<v Speaker 3>Or you had to have a calling card.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You remember those things?</v>

2842
01:48:45.950 --> 01:48:48.050
<v Speaker 3>He'd have a car did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would get,</v>

2843
01:48:48.380 --> 01:48:51.080
<v Speaker 3>I would get fake cards too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He could buy them off people.</v>

2844
01:48:51.081 --> 01:48:51.914
<v Speaker 3>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like counterfeit cards and they were </v>

2845
01:48:53.631 --> 01:48:55.460
<v Speaker 3>good for a couple of days and they'd go </v>
<v Speaker 3>under,</v>

2846
01:48:56.120 --> 01:48:56.953
<v Speaker 3>I think you'd buy other ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there was other things you </v>

2847
01:48:58.221 --> 01:49:01.490
<v Speaker 3>could do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could take a sound device and put it</v>

2848
01:49:01.491 --> 01:49:06.110
<v Speaker 3>up to the phone and you could get a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get a call with that.</v>

2849
01:49:06.111 --> 01:49:06.944
<v Speaker 3>Like you would put up this thing to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>voice box area and it would make noises </v>

2850
01:49:10.550 --> 01:49:11.970
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2851
01:49:12.140 --> 01:49:13.570
<v Speaker 3>And it would somehow or another,</v>

2852
01:49:13.640 --> 01:49:14.800
<v Speaker 2>it should open up the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2853
01:49:14.801 --> 01:49:15.670
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the line.</v>

2854
01:49:16.200 --> 01:49:17.860
<v Speaker 2>I remember that we are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we used to before the,</v>

2855
01:49:18.410 --> 01:49:20.350
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before the cell phone technology hit.</v>

2856
01:49:20.380 --> 01:49:24.580
<v Speaker 2>And this is early days of being with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>agency and when you were overseas,</v>

2857
01:49:24.970 --> 01:49:25.803
<v Speaker 2>if you were in an urban setting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you spent half your time looking for </v>

2858
01:49:28.181 --> 01:49:29.650
<v Speaker 2>operating payphones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 2>actually works.</v>

2861
01:49:33.401 --> 01:49:34.570
<v Speaker 2>Cause you got to make some sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the kids,</v>

2864
01:49:40.340 --> 01:49:41.173

<v Speaker 2>the kids today and the agency don't </v>

2865
01:49:42.311 --> 01:49:43.300
<v Speaker 2>understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2866
01:49:43.301 --> 01:49:46.900
<v Speaker 2>cause they've all got great technology </v>
<v Speaker 2>and mobile communications.</v>

2867
01:49:47.440 --> 01:49:48.400
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2868
01:49:48.420 --> 01:49:49.540
<v Speaker 2>In the old days it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it didn't,</v>

2869
01:49:49.560 --> 01:49:51.080
<v Speaker 2>it didn't work that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2870
01:49:51.190 --> 01:49:53.260
<v Speaker 2>those are people that we know what a </v>
<v Speaker 2>phone booth is.</v>

2871
01:49:54.070 --> 01:49:54.401
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2872
01:49:54.401 --> 01:49:55.060
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

2873
01:49:55.060 --> 01:49:56.980
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look about fights.</v>

2874
01:49:57.040 --> 01:49:57.873
<v Speaker 2>That's like a common expression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These two could have fought in a phone </v>

2875
01:49:59.651 --> 01:50:00.484
<v Speaker 2>booth that could have fought fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't even say it could have a fight in </v>

2876
01:50:03.011 --> 01:50:06.010
<v Speaker 2>a phone booth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But today you say fight in a phone booth</v>

2877
01:50:06.011 --> 01:50:06.844
<v Speaker 2>and people go,</v>

<v Speaker 2>You haven't met a phone in it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>There's a num work.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you could probably find one </v>

2886
01:50:24.131 --> 01:50:25.390
<v Speaker 2>occasionally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got a phone in it,</v>

2887
01:50:25.690 --> 01:50:28.480
<v Speaker 2>but it wasn't that long ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember they actually had functioning</v>

2888
01:50:28.500 --> 01:50:29.333
<v Speaker 2>phones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would go outside any seven 11 or </v>

2889
01:50:32.711 --> 01:50:35.050
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they were doing a bank of payphones.</v>

2890
01:50:35.170 --> 01:50:36.460
<v Speaker 2>I actually stopped and took a picture.</v>

2891

<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget where the hell are.</v>

<v Speaker 2>station.</v>

2893
01:50:39.821 --> 01:50:41.020
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was pulling out after,</v>

2894
01:50:41.650 --> 01:50:43.470
<v Speaker 2>oddly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting gas and uh,</v>

2895
01:50:43.720 --> 01:50:47.050
<v Speaker 2>I looked over to the side and there was </v>
<v Speaker 2>a pay phone against the wall.</v>

2896
01:50:47.130 --> 01:50:49.870
<v Speaker 2>And then now that the receiver was just </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangling on the ground,</v>

2897
01:50:49.871 --> 01:50:50.704
<v Speaker 2>but I literally stopped,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got out and took a picture of it so I </v>

2898
01:50:52.301 --> 01:50:53.600
<v Speaker 2>could show my kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2899
01:50:53.670 --> 01:50:56.440
<v Speaker 2>we used to make calls on these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is how it worked.</v>

2900
01:50:57.340 --> 01:50:59.110
<v Speaker 2>I remember when there was no answering </v>
<v Speaker 2>machines.</v>

2901
01:50:59.111 --> 01:51:00.010
<v Speaker 2>You remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2902
01:51:00.040 --> 01:51:01.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the first answer and machine,</v>

2903
01:51:01.990 --> 01:51:04.480
<v Speaker 2>whoever your buddy was a got the </v>
<v Speaker 2>answering machine first.</v>

2904
01:51:04.540 --> 01:51:05.410
<v Speaker 2>You thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2905
01:51:05.411 --> 01:51:07.690
<v Speaker 2>that's the deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's so plush.</v>

2906
01:51:07.840 --> 01:51:11.500
<v Speaker 2>And I remember we got an answering </v>
<v Speaker 2>machine where you could call it,</v>

2907
01:51:11.830 --> 01:51:12.663
<v Speaker 2>and then when the dial tone went on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would punch in like a code and you </v>

2908
01:51:16.001 --> 01:51:18.580
<v Speaker 2>could listen to your messages and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>weren't even home.</v>

2909
01:51:18.610 --> 01:51:19.443
<v Speaker 2>You could retrieve those messages crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could call it the car to your </v>

2910
01:51:23.771 --> 01:51:26.530
<v Speaker 2>answering machine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a funny,</v>

2911
01:51:26.531 --> 01:51:27.221
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2912
01:51:27.221 --> 01:51:28.170
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you shouldn't.</v>

2913
01:51:28.171 --> 01:51:29.110
<v Speaker 2>I guess I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do I know?</v>

2914
01:51:29.111 --> 01:51:31.240
<v Speaker 2>But you should never start a story out </v>
<v Speaker 2>by saying there's a funny story.</v>

2915
01:51:32.650 --> 01:51:36.380
<v Speaker 2>There's a story that when Lyndon Johnson</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a,</v>

2916

<v Speaker 2>not president,</v>

2917

<v Speaker 2>what are you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where are you calling me now?</v>

2934

<v Speaker 2>So this,</v>

2937
01:52:13.870 --> 01:52:15.310
<v Speaker 2>as the story goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Phones in their car back then.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Pimp you had to be in 1969 to pull up </v>

2961
01:53:04.701 --> 01:53:05.534
<v Speaker 1>and like a 69 corvette.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fucking phone in your car or a </v>

2962
01:53:08.591 --> 01:53:09.950
<v Speaker 1>Lincoln town car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

2963
01:53:09.951 --> 01:53:10.784
<v Speaker 1>This is what that's like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] is a mobile phone device </v>

2964
01:53:13.431 --> 01:53:16.100
<v Speaker 1>specifically designed to be fitting in </v>
<v Speaker 1>automobile.</v>

2965
01:53:16.160 --> 01:53:17.330
<v Speaker 1>That's what we should call him back </v>
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>

2966
01:53:17.331 --> 01:53:18.164
<v Speaker 1>Car phones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember service originated with the </v>

2967
01:53:20.121 --> 01:53:22.760
<v Speaker 1>bell system and was first used in Saint </v>
<v Speaker 1>Louis.</v>

2968
01:53:23.060 --> 01:53:25.790
<v Speaker 1>June 17th,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1946.</v>

2969
01:53:25.840 --> 01:53:27.980
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before the fucking end of the war,</v>

2970
01:53:27.981 --> 01:53:28.850
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2971
01:53:29.140 --> 01:53:29.501
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2972
01:53:29.501 --> 01:53:31.040
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was after the end of the war.</v>

2973
01:53:31.041 --> 01:53:32.660
<v Speaker 1>End.</v>
<v Speaker 1>45 okay.</v>

2974
01:53:32.690 --> 01:53:35.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a year after the World War II,</v>

2975
01:53:35.690 --> 01:53:38.180
<v Speaker 1>that's an incredible phone in their car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And more importantly,</v>

2976
01:53:38.410 --> 01:53:39.243
<v Speaker 1>why St Louis?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was what that was going on in St </v>

2977
01:53:41.690 --> 01:53:41.690
<v Speaker 1>Louis?</v>

2978
01:53:41.690 --> 01:53:43.400
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the site of the first car phone.</v>

2979
01:53:43.670 --> 01:53:44.503
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a radio enthusiasts who had the </v>

2980
01:53:46.251 --> 01:53:49.700
<v Speaker 1>foresight to invent the annoying habit </v>
<v Speaker 1>of talking on the phone in the car.</v>

2981
01:53:50.130 --> 01:53:50.963
<v Speaker 1>So that basically worked on the radio </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it would somehow or another connect </v>

2982
01:53:54.531 --> 01:53:56.270
<v Speaker 1>to a regular phone line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it worked?</v>

2983
01:53:56.650 --> 01:53:58.400
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

2984
01:53:58.430 --> 01:53:59.263
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is way beyond my apple had this </v>

2985
01:54:02.550 --> 01:54:03.383
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Johnson had it when he was in the </v>

2986
01:54:04.170 --> 01:54:05.040
<v Speaker 1>Senate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

2987
01:54:05.290 --> 01:54:06.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So and that would have been,</v>

2988
01:54:06.350 --> 01:54:06.861
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>

2989
01:54:06.861 --> 01:54:08.720
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would have been like 15 years after</v>

2990
01:54:08.721 --> 01:54:12.040
<v Speaker 1>this happened to her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or 14 years after.</v>

2991
01:54:12.350 --> 01:54:14.180
<v Speaker 1>After they invented it in Saint Louis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

2992
01:54:14.510 --> 01:54:15.560
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember when they,</v>

2993
01:54:15.561 --> 01:54:16.394
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mobile phone then was that big case </v>

2994
01:54:17.960 --> 01:54:18.793
<v Speaker 1>that we carry around and you had to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of your car is set out out on your </v>

2995
01:54:20.721 --> 01:54:21.930
<v Speaker 1>car and then it started getting it.</v>

2996
01:54:22.310 --> 01:54:24.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'll be a big fucking thing.</v>

2997
01:54:24.631 --> 01:54:26.600
<v Speaker 1>You throw over your shoulder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A big handle.</v>

2998
01:54:26.780 --> 01:54:27.613
<v Speaker 1>I got a big box at home full of all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>old phones that I've had over the years </v>

2999
01:54:31.190 --> 01:54:33.920
<v Speaker 1>and it's like if I could ever get myself</v>
<v Speaker 1>organized,</v>

3000
01:54:34.220 --> 01:54:35.053
<v Speaker 1>I would turn it into some sort of wall </v>
<v Speaker 1>art installation because it's cell </v>

3001
01:54:38.241 --> 01:54:41.060
<v Speaker 1>phones through the years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least covering the past few decades.</v>

3002
01:54:41.700 --> 01:54:43.030
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you got there?</v>

3003
01:54:43.050 --> 01:54:43.883
<v Speaker 1>Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 1>First developed in 1920 mobile wireless </v>

<v Speaker 1>Send and receive messages in the 1920s </v>

3005
01:54:53.700 --> 01:54:57.020
<v Speaker 1>in 19 and 20 Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy behind him as the boss,</v>

3006
01:54:57.040 --> 01:54:58.430
<v Speaker 1>you can tell he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's listening.</v>

3007
01:54:58.460 --> 01:55:01.360
<v Speaker 1>He's the guy in charge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man did it.</v>

3008
01:55:01.370 --> 01:55:02.240

<v Speaker 1>they came over the other day and my </v>

3061
01:57:10.441 --> 01:57:13.830
<v Speaker 1>wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's definitely outputted my coverage,</v>

3062
01:57:13.890 --> 01:57:17.910
<v Speaker 1>she has a lot smarter than I am and much</v>
<v Speaker 1>more organized and efficient,</v>

3063
01:57:18.360 --> 01:57:20.940
<v Speaker 1>but she wasn't there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the guys with the plans,</v>

3064
01:57:20.970 --> 01:57:22.620
<v Speaker 1>whatever they call them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the planners,</v>

3065
01:57:23.010 --> 01:57:27.090
<v Speaker 1>they came over to show me the drawings </v>
<v Speaker 1>as if I care.</v>

3066
01:57:27.480 --> 01:57:28.313
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or as if I could actually read these </v>

3067
01:57:29.401 --> 01:57:31.680
<v Speaker 1>drawings right there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the blueprints for what they're going to</v>

<v Speaker 1>and made a little notation on one.</v>

3070
01:57:40.501 --> 01:57:41.820
<v Speaker 1>I actually really did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just said,</v>

<v Speaker 1>what are you thinking?</v>

3073
01:57:44.971 --> 01:57:45.804

3076
01:57:51.150 --> 01:57:51.983
<v Speaker 1>I've engaged in at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's going to take about three </v>

3077
01:57:53.251 --> 01:57:54.084
<v Speaker 1>months and we're going to have ourselves</v>
<v Speaker 1>one hell of a kitchen so it won't be </v>

3078
01:57:57.541 --> 01:58:00.180
<v Speaker 1>done by the time you show up.</v>

3238
02:03:43.971 --> 02:03:46.250
<v Speaker 1>I can not afford to hurt myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got too much work to do.</v>

3239
02:03:46.251 --> 02:03:47.450
<v Speaker 1>Don't get hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't get hurt,</v>

3240
02:03:47.451 --> 02:03:49.490
<v Speaker 1>don't get hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't get hurt.</v>

3241
02:03:49.790 --> 02:03:53.090
<v Speaker 1>I was snowboarding one time and I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just completely lost it.</v>

3242
02:03:53.470 --> 02:03:54.303
<v Speaker 1>A cracked some ribs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't catch my breath when I was </v>

3243
02:03:56.421 --> 02:03:57.254
<v Speaker 1>laying on my back and it was towards the</v>
<v Speaker 1>end of the day in which always that's </v>

3244
02:04:00.021 --> 02:04:00.651
<v Speaker 1>when it happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3245
02:04:00.651 --> 02:04:01.484
<v Speaker 1>You're exhausted but you think I'm going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do one more run because it sounds </v>

3246
02:04:04.161 --> 02:04:05.610
<v Speaker 1>like a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so anyway,</v>

3247
02:04:05.611 --> 02:04:07.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm laying down there and there was </v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody else out.</v>

3248
02:04:07.700 --> 02:04:08.533
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was getting twilight and I'm looking </v>

3249
02:04:09.591 --> 02:04:11.550
<v Speaker 1>up at the sky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this here?</v>

3250
02:04:11.580 --> 02:04:12.413
<v Speaker 1>This is this sound good at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I hear this noise behind me and </v>

3251
02:04:14.091 --> 02:04:15.320
<v Speaker 1>these two guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it couldn't have been.</v>

3252
02:04:15.530 --> 02:04:17.720
<v Speaker 1>Both of them are probably like 19 maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>they come,</v>

3253
02:04:17.750 --> 02:04:18.583
<v Speaker 1>they come screeching to a stop and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking up and I'm trying to catch my </v>

3254
02:04:22.401 --> 02:04:25.640
<v Speaker 1>breath and I can't really move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so all I can see is when their faces</v>

3255
02:04:25.641 --> 02:04:29.630
<v Speaker 1>come into the frame above my head and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they both looked down at me and they go,</v>

3256
02:04:29.660 --> 02:04:30.890
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

3257
02:04:31.220 --> 02:04:35.210
<v Speaker 1>And then they take off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>left you then left me there.</v>

3258
02:04:35.240 --> 02:04:36.950
<v Speaker 1>They didn't do it I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I didn't say,</v>

3259
02:04:36.960 --> 02:04:37.460
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>

3260
02:04:37.460 --> 02:04:38.070
<v Speaker 1>maybe we'll paint it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I</v>

3261
02:04:38.070 --> 02:04:38.903
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't say anything because I was </v>

3262
02:04:39.361 --> 02:04:41.670
<v Speaker 2>trying to catch my breath and they just </v>
<v Speaker 2>take off and I'm thinking,</v>

3263
02:04:41.990 --> 02:04:45.120
<v Speaker 2>well that's sucks a small window.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say help.</v>

3264
02:04:45.300 --> 02:04:46.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pride.</v>

3265
02:04:47.540 --> 02:04:48.373
<v Speaker 2>Ego.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3266
02:04:48.410 --> 02:04:49.290
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

3267
02:04:49.320 --> 02:04:50.970
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to tell these little fucks </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I'm hurt.</v>

3268
02:04:51.390 --> 02:04:52.090
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

3269
02:04:52.090 --> 02:04:53.820
<v Speaker 2>Little punks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dropped into a tree,</v>

3270
02:04:53.821 --> 02:04:57.210
<v Speaker 2>well a couple of seasons ago and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

3271
02:04:57.330 --> 02:04:59.440
<v Speaker 2>we were out on the well a tree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well and I was saying,</v>

3272
02:04:59.441 --> 02:05:01.530
<v Speaker 2>what's that country?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you know how you have a tree,</v>

3273
02:05:01.620 --> 02:05:02.940
<v Speaker 2>lots of snow falling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3274
02:05:02.941 --> 02:05:05.400
<v Speaker 2>you got powder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what will happen sometimes is you</v>

3275
02:05:05.401 --> 02:05:08.310
<v Speaker 2>get the appearance of solid snow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but around the tree,</v>

3276
02:05:08.311 --> 02:05:09.630
<v Speaker 2>the base of the tree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll get these,</v>

3277
02:05:09.690 --> 02:05:13.650
<v Speaker 2>these little caves almost like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing around the bottom of the</v>

3278
02:05:13.651 --> 02:05:15.980
<v Speaker 2>tree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the tendency is for the snow.</v>

3279
02:05:16.020 --> 02:05:17.400
<v Speaker 2>If you get too close to the tree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3280
02:05:17.401 --> 02:05:20.100
<v Speaker 2>you'll collapse into it and then you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>the bottom of this hole,</v>

3281
02:05:20.130 --> 02:05:20.740
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3282
02:05:20.740 --> 02:05:22.530
<v Speaker 2>And you're trying to get out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And usually it happens,</v>

3283
02:05:22.531 --> 02:05:23.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when there's beautiful snow,</v>

3284
02:05:23.930 --> 02:05:25.830
<v Speaker 2>it's all powder and you can't get out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>

3285
02:05:25.960 --> 02:05:26.793
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my wife and I were on the backside of </v>

3286
02:05:28.561 --> 02:05:30.170
<v Speaker 2>this mountain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so there's nobody around.</v>

3287
02:05:30.180 --> 02:05:32.220
<v Speaker 2>She got out ahead of me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3288
02:05:32.340 --> 02:05:33.173
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fell into this thing and that's the </v>

3289
02:05:35.491 --> 02:05:38.580
<v Speaker 2>time when I thought to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after about 35 minutes,</v>

3290
02:05:38.730 --> 02:05:40.320
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to haul my ass out of there,</v>

3291
02:05:40.710 --> 02:05:43.710
<v Speaker 2>I thought I could actually die here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the snow was falling lightly,</v>

3292
02:05:43.711 --> 02:05:44.544
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there was still a little bit of sun </v>

3293
02:05:45.061 --> 02:05:47.130
<v Speaker 2>coming through and it was a beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

3294
02:05:47.131 --> 02:05:50.130
<v Speaker 2>And I literally thought I had to lay </v>
<v Speaker 2>down for a minute to catch my breath and</v>

3295
02:05:50.131 --> 02:05:51.270
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll give this another try.</v>

3296
02:05:51.720 --> 02:05:52.553
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>

3297
02:05:53.130 --> 02:05:56.010
<v Speaker 2>there's worse places to die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I know he thought that.</v>

3298
02:05:56.100 --> 02:05:56.761
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>

3299
02:05:56.761 --> 02:05:57.870
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you got to go here,</v>

3300
02:05:57.871 --> 02:06:00.210
<v Speaker 2>because I'm thinking at some point my </v>
<v Speaker 2>heart's going to explode because I was,</v>

3301
02:06:00.211 --> 02:06:02.020
<v Speaker 2>I was working like a son of a bitch.</v>

3302
02:06:02.650 --> 02:06:05.430
<v Speaker 2>How are we trying to do it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just try it out first.</v>

3303
02:06:05.730 --> 02:06:06.600
<v Speaker 2>At first you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3304
02:06:06.601 --> 02:06:08.820
<v Speaker 2>I get my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get my skis back on and get out of here.</v>

3305
02:06:08.821 --> 02:06:09.920
<v Speaker 2>Or maybe I won't get my skis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>

3306
02:06:09.921 --> 02:06:12.120
<v Speaker 2>I'll try to just step out of here and </v>
<v Speaker 2>get up.</v>

3307
02:06:12.270 --> 02:06:15.420
<v Speaker 2>But it's just all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like being in a quicksand.</v>

3308
02:06:15.490 --> 02:06:17.550
<v Speaker 2>It's like being in quicksand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess is a good analogy.</v>

3309
02:06:17.551 --> 02:06:18.384
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's just that you can't get a </v>

3310
02:06:19.411 --> 02:06:20.244
<v Speaker 2>grip on anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't get ahold of anything and </v>

3311
02:06:21.361 --> 02:06:22.194
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to pull yourself back up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even if you do get a little ways </v>

3312
02:06:23.821 --> 02:06:24.300
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're on,</v>

3313
02:06:24.300 --> 02:06:25.170
<v Speaker 2>you're on powder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3314
02:06:25.171 --> 02:06:26.760
<v Speaker 2>And this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there was a beautiful powder day,</v>

3315
02:06:26.761 --> 02:06:28.440
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Blue skies is this powder.</v>

3316
02:06:29.120 --> 02:06:29.953
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you sink into it up to your thighs and </v>

3317
02:06:31.860 --> 02:06:33.960
<v Speaker 2>beyond.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when you're doing that,</v>

3318
02:06:33.961 --> 02:06:35.010
<v Speaker 2>think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're trying to,</v>

3319
02:06:35.460 --> 02:06:36.293
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause then at a certain point you gotta </v>

3320
02:06:37.290 --> 02:06:38.360
<v Speaker 2>get your skis back on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

3321
02:06:38.361 --> 02:06:38.670
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3322
02:06:38.670 --> 02:06:39.301
<v Speaker 2>And then your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

3323
02:06:39.301 --> 02:06:39.931
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

3324
02:06:39.931 --> 02:06:40.761
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

3325
02:06:40.761 --> 02:06:42.960
<v Speaker 2>you're about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're about done.</v>

3326
02:06:42.990 --> 02:06:44.190
<v Speaker 2>By the time you get out of a tree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3327
02:06:44.310 --> 02:06:46.320
<v Speaker 2>and now you're trying to get your skis </v>
<v Speaker 2>back on and you're,</v>

3328
02:06:46.321 --> 02:06:47.790
<v Speaker 2>you're in powder and you're trying to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

3329
02:06:47.791 --> 02:06:48.510
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3330
02:06:48.510 --> 02:06:50.830
<v Speaker 2>it turned into a real gogo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

3331
02:06:50.831 --> 02:06:51.664
<v Speaker 2>I guess my point for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it was a beautiful day and I </v>

3332
02:06:52.801 --> 02:06:53.634
<v Speaker 2>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>

3333
02:06:53.780 --> 02:06:54.613
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not that I was going to lay down and </v>

3334
02:06:55.411 --> 02:06:56.850
<v Speaker 2>die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I thought if you had to,</v>

3335
02:06:56.910 --> 02:06:59.430
<v Speaker 2>if you happen to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a bad place.</v>

3336
02:06:59.431 --> 02:07:00.780
<v Speaker 2>It's a great attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's also,</v>

3337
02:07:00.781 --> 02:07:03.060
<v Speaker 2>I think indicative of how much shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've seen in your life.</v>

3338
02:07:03.540 --> 02:07:04.990
<v Speaker 2>God says this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

3339
02:07:05.010 --> 02:07:06.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was worried about the wolves.</v>

3340
02:07:06.480 --> 02:07:10.110
<v Speaker 2>The wolves come by.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It not my bones would do.</v>

3341
02:07:10.160 --> 02:07:12.520
<v Speaker 2>They would like that guy's coyote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3342
02:07:12.521 --> 02:07:14.540
<v Speaker 2>it was a horrible story about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3343
02:07:14.670 --> 02:07:18.450
<v Speaker 2>in Africa where a toddler got stolen by </v>
<v Speaker 2>a leopard.</v>

3344
02:07:18.780 --> 02:07:20.760
<v Speaker 2>I put it on my twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jeez.</v>

3345
02:07:20.990 --> 02:07:23.100
<v Speaker 2>I put that stuff on my twitter all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

3346
02:07:23.101 --> 02:07:24.540
<v Speaker 2>People go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why do you put this up?</v>

3347
02:07:24.790 --> 02:07:27.960

<v Speaker 2>Because I want people to know.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3354
02:07:40.050 --> 02:07:41.530
<v Speaker 1>and I was talking to some folks there </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I know,</v>

3355
02:07:41.620 --> 02:07:42.453
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause we used to live out there a while </v>

3356
02:07:44.410 --> 02:07:48.010
<v Speaker 1>back before we moved to Idaho and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were telling me a story that they've got</v>

3357
02:07:48.011 --> 02:07:48.844
<v Speaker 1>this alert out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This bobcat is on the loose in </v>

3358
02:07:51.251 --> 02:07:53.200
<v Speaker 1>Connecticut right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a pretty rural state.</v>

3359
02:07:53.201 --> 02:07:54.210
<v Speaker 1>People don't realize that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3360
02:07:54.211 --> 02:07:55.210
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a rural state.</v>

3361
02:07:55.211 --> 02:07:56.120
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

3362
02:07:56.121 --> 02:07:58.210
<v Speaker 1>this lady was walking her two little </v>
<v Speaker 1>dogs,</v>

3363
02:07:58.510 --> 02:07:59.950
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what kind of dogs they were.</v>

3364
02:07:59.951 --> 02:08:00.784
<v Speaker 1>But this out of nowhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this bobcat just like swooped and </v>

3365
02:08:02.561 --> 02:08:04.360
<v Speaker 1>grabbed one of them took off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 1>her dog,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so she's trying to chase so she gets</v>

3369
02:08:10.781 --> 02:08:12.610
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they had sightings of this thing,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Connecticut a few years back and I think</v>

3373
02:08:21.071 --> 02:08:23.890
<v Speaker 1>he got killed on the highway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>across our front yard and Connecticut.</v>

<v Speaker 4>video.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I guess</v>

3396
02:09:25.790 --> 02:09:28.250
<v Speaker 1>I would punt that thing and do another </v>
<v Speaker 1>dimension.</v>

3397
02:09:28.280 --> 02:09:30.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>The omelette pan out.</v>

3399
02:09:31.980 --> 02:09:32.813
<v Speaker 1>If this is going down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going down right now and I'm going </v>

3400

<v Speaker 1>to choose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3414
02:10:27.100 --> 02:10:27.750
<v Speaker 1>but you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

3415
02:10:27.750 --> 02:10:29.980
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the notion about what wildlife is like.</v>

3416
02:10:30.170 --> 02:10:30.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3417
02:10:30.680 --> 02:10:31.513
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

3418
02:10:31.770 --> 02:10:35.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just it and it's that difference,</v>

3419
02:10:35.001 --> 02:10:35.661
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a difference.</v>

3420
02:10:35.661 --> 02:10:38.180
<v Speaker 1>If you're living in New York City,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got this perspective about,</v>

3421
02:10:38.181 --> 02:10:39.014
<v Speaker 1>about it and it's all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why I'm [inaudible] Kylie's have </v>

3422
02:10:41.331 --> 02:10:42.164
<v Speaker 1>made their way into New York City.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna start snatching dogs and </v>

3423
02:10:44.421 --> 02:10:45.440
<v Speaker 1>people are going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3424
02:10:45.620 --> 02:10:47.700
<v Speaker 1>they're not our friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not,</v>

3425
02:10:47.701 --> 02:10:48.534
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not like,</v>

3426
02:10:48.550 --> 02:10:50.380
<v Speaker 1>why Coyote?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should.</v>

3427
02:10:50.390 --> 02:10:52.400
<v Speaker 1>We just need to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need to understand why they're upset.</v>

3428
02:10:52.730 --> 02:10:55.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've encroached on their land.</v>

3429
02:10:55.430 --> 02:10:56.263
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

3430
02:10:56.270 --> 02:10:58.770
<v Speaker 1>This is what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was the best hunting trip yet?</v>

3431
02:10:59.390 --> 02:11:02.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm curious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My favorite to hunt his elk.</v>

3432
02:11:02.210 --> 02:11:03.080
<v Speaker 1>Elk?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3433
02:11:03.230 --> 02:11:04.063
<v Speaker 1>because first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you get one elk and you get </v>

3434
02:11:05.691 --> 02:11:07.640
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of pounds of meat and I love </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

3435
02:11:07.641 --> 02:11:09.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's delicious.</v>

3436
02:11:09.320 --> 02:11:11.570
<v Speaker 1>The only thing that's as delicious as </v>
<v Speaker 1>this axis,</v>

3437
02:11:11.571 --> 02:11:13.700
<v Speaker 1>deer access deer is pretty damn </v>
<v Speaker 1>delicious.</v>

3438
02:11:14.180 --> 02:11:15.013
<v Speaker 1>The thing about axis deer too is it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the most ethical trips because </v>

3439
02:11:20.511 --> 02:11:23.900
<v Speaker 1>you have to kill them because they don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have any natural predators at all.</v>

3440
02:11:23.901 --> 02:11:26.300
<v Speaker 1>And there's 20,000 of 'em on Lanai </v>
<v Speaker 1>alone.</v>

3441
02:11:26.301 --> 02:11:27.134
<v Speaker 1>Then there's the lor on Molokai.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have them on Maui and there's no </v>

3442
02:11:29.991 --> 02:11:30.824
<v Speaker 1>predators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they literally have a responsibility </v>

3443
02:11:33.260 --> 02:11:34.093
<v Speaker 1>to kill them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise they're going to face </v>

3444
02:11:34.851 --> 02:11:37.490
<v Speaker 1>starvation and disease and </v>
<v Speaker 1>overpopulation,</v>

3445
02:11:37.730 --> 02:11:40.310
<v Speaker 1>decimation of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of plant life.</v>

3446
02:11:40.610 --> 02:11:42.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just eat everything in sight.</v>

3447
02:11:42.410 --> 02:11:45.100
<v Speaker 1>Do you have to get a separate license </v>
<v Speaker 1>for each island or how does that not,</v>

3448
02:11:45.140 --> 02:11:47.750
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you get a Hawaii state license,</v>

3449
02:11:47.751 --> 02:11:50.330
<v Speaker 1>but the way it works in Lanai,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

3450
02:11:50.360 --> 02:11:51.620
<v Speaker 1>you could shoot 12 of them.</v>

3451
02:11:52.100 --> 02:11:54.290
<v Speaker 1>12,</v>
<v Speaker 1>12 that's how many they have,</v>

3452
02:11:54.291 --> 02:11:55.890
<v Speaker 1>which is crazy for deer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3453
02:11:56.180 --> 02:12:00.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean the most he ever hear is like two</v>
<v Speaker 1>bucks in some states and you know,</v>

3454
02:12:00.050 --> 02:12:01.550
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're really have a lot of deers.</v>

3455
02:12:01.580 --> 02:12:02.960
<v Speaker 1>What do you end up with once you address</v>
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>

3456
02:12:03.290 --> 02:12:04.123
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say each one you're getting </v>

3457
02:12:08.031 --> 02:12:12.470
<v Speaker 1>around 50 plus pounds of meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're about 200 pounds on the hoof.</v>

3458
02:12:12.510 --> 02:12:13.570
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3459
02:12:13.690 --> 02:12:14.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They look,</v>

3460
02:12:15.290 --> 02:12:17.220
<v Speaker 1>they look more delicate than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

3461
02:12:17.260 --> 02:12:19.370
<v Speaker 1>now it's a fairly big animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're heavy.</v>

3462
02:12:19.850 --> 02:12:22.580
<v Speaker 1>They're fast as fuck too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Yeah,</v>

3463
02:12:22.581 --> 02:12:24.320
<v Speaker 1>when they run and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

3464
02:12:24.620 --> 02:12:26.410
<v Speaker 1>They mean they run like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3465
02:12:26.440 --> 02:12:27.590
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

3466
02:12:27.591 --> 02:12:29.270
<v Speaker 1>it's like an African animal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a deer.</v>

3467
02:12:29.390 --> 02:12:30.223
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's much faster than a regular deer </v>

3468
02:12:31.640 --> 02:12:32.473
<v Speaker 1>because it's like that white tail that </v>
<v Speaker 1>took off and that video weight quicker </v>

3469
02:12:35.781 --> 02:12:37.010
<v Speaker 1>than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would be,</v>

3470
02:12:37.230 --> 02:12:38.890
<v Speaker 1>that guy was not exactly what he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>

3471
02:12:38.910 --> 02:12:39.743
<v Speaker 1>Both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3472
02:12:40.600 --> 02:12:42.980
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't use him as the bar to set </v>
<v Speaker 1>this by.</v>

3473
02:12:43.190 --> 02:12:44.023
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was like a light bulb that you have </v>

3474
02:12:44.571 --> 02:12:46.730
<v Speaker 1>to slap a couple of times to get it to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go on.</v>

3475
02:12:47.380 --> 02:12:48.890
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

3476
02:12:48.891 --> 02:12:50.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3477
02:12:50.930 --> 02:12:53.600
<v Speaker 1>I had a follow up question to the deer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dammit.</v>

3478
02:12:53.630 --> 02:12:54.830
<v Speaker 1>This is what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get older,</v>

3479
02:12:55.190 --> 02:12:59.210
<v Speaker 1>I know that holy smokes and they start </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting up in the middle of the night to</v>

3480
02:12:59.211 --> 02:13:00.350
<v Speaker 1>go pee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're,</v>

3481
02:13:00.351 --> 02:13:01.184
<v Speaker 1>you're out in this island.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is this gorgeous island on the </v>

3482
02:13:04.460 --> 02:13:07.250
<v Speaker 1>Pacific Ocean with just beautiful views.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's just unbelievable.</v>

3483
02:13:07.251 --> 02:13:10.220
<v Speaker 1>Stunning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's filled with these deer.</v>

3484
02:13:10.250 --> 02:13:11.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean they are everywhere on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>island.</v>

3485
02:13:11.930 --> 02:13:13.640
<v Speaker 1>That's the best thing about when it </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes down to it,</v>

3486
02:13:13.880 --> 02:13:14.780
<v Speaker 1>the hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fishing,</v>

3487
02:13:15.080 --> 02:13:18.110
<v Speaker 1>it's just being out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you have to remember,</v>

3488
02:13:18.111 --> 02:13:18.944
<v Speaker 1>you have to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I mean like it even went fly </v>

3489
02:13:20.721 --> 02:13:22.910
<v Speaker 1>fishing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you get caught up and all of a</v>

3490
02:13:22.911 --> 02:13:23.744
<v Speaker 1>sudden you have to stop and you step </v>
<v Speaker 1>back and you kind of look around and </v>

3491
02:13:24.970 --> 02:13:25.970
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

3492
02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.220
<v Speaker 1>this makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't do enough fishing.</v>

3493
02:13:28.221 --> 02:13:29.630
<v Speaker 1>I fucking love fishing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

3494
02:13:29.690 --> 02:13:32.130
<v Speaker 1>I've done fishing a few times recently </v>
<v Speaker 1>with my kids,</v>

3495
02:13:32.131 --> 02:13:35.400
<v Speaker 1>but it's ocean fishing where you're out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there trolling,</v>

3496
02:13:35.430 --> 02:13:36.263
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in a boat and you're pulling the </v>

3497
02:13:37.231 --> 02:13:38.064
<v Speaker 1>line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not as fun casting like on a lake </v>

3498
02:13:40.201 --> 02:13:42.750
<v Speaker 1>is the best like top water bait or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

3499
02:13:43.190 --> 02:13:44.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's great for kids.</v>

3500
02:13:44.101 --> 02:13:44.934
<v Speaker 1>Kids love that</v>

3501
02:13:44.950 --> 02:13:46.690
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've started taking,</v>

3502
02:13:46.691 --> 02:13:47.524
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been lucky enough to be a part of </v>

3503
02:13:49.331 --> 02:13:50.164
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an Alaskan fishing trip that happens </v>

3504
02:13:51.881 --> 02:13:55.390
<v Speaker 2>every year when you guys go for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>halibut salmon.</v>

3505
02:13:56.620 --> 02:13:59.180
<v Speaker 2>And I've actually got a picture of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>couple of the halibut to,</v>

3506
02:13:59.220 --> 02:14:00.011
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my boy,</v>

3507
02:14:00.011 --> 02:14:01.810
<v Speaker 2>cause now he's old enough I can bring </v>
<v Speaker 2>him with me.</v>

3508
02:14:02.260 --> 02:14:04.760
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

3509
02:14:04.900 --> 02:14:07.150
<v Speaker 2>and so we go every year when it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a group of guys,</v>

3510
02:14:07.151 --> 02:14:08.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this as maybe a 20 guys.</v>

3511
02:14:09.500 --> 02:14:10.450
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he,</v>

3512
02:14:10.530 --> 02:14:13.120
<v Speaker 2>he hauls up this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this was his first time going,</v>

3513
02:14:13.121 --> 02:14:14.050
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's up in Alaska,</v>

3514
02:14:14.051 --> 02:14:15.670
<v Speaker 2>this beautiful place and he just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just,</v>

3515
02:14:15.700 --> 02:14:17.350
<v Speaker 2>you could just tell it just snapped him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3516
02:14:17.351 --> 02:14:18.580
<v Speaker 2>He was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God.</v>

3517
02:14:18.581 --> 02:14:19.990
<v Speaker 2>The expansive at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3518
02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:23.590
<v Speaker 2>It's just the size of this place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you get out on the water and he</v>

3519
02:14:23.591 --> 02:14:24.424
<v Speaker 2>starts hauling up this thing and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's this massive halibut and he </v>

3520
02:14:27.381 --> 02:14:28.214
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't even put two words together </v>

3521
02:14:31.150 --> 02:14:33.910
<v Speaker 2>and then you have to tell them it's got </v>
<v Speaker 2>to go back in the water cause it's,</v>

3522
02:14:34.040 --> 02:14:35.500
<v Speaker 2>it's not big enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3523
02:14:35.700 --> 02:14:36.533
<v Speaker 2>So it's getting halibut's gotta be </v>
<v Speaker 2>either below or above a certain size </v>

3524
02:14:38.900 --> 02:14:41.890
<v Speaker 2>that the middle range has maximum for </v>
<v Speaker 2>breeding.</v>

3525
02:14:42.160 --> 02:14:43.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get them too big.</v>

3526
02:14:43.481 --> 02:14:44.680
<v Speaker 2>They have to let them go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3527
02:14:45.070 --> 02:14:46.510
<v Speaker 2>If you get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you get them.</v>

3528
02:14:46.540 --> 02:14:47.860
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

3529
02:14:48.060 --> 02:14:50.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the big enough while I'm talking,</v>

3530
02:14:50.291 --> 02:14:50.651
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>

3531
02:14:50.651 --> 02:14:52.570
<v Speaker 2>I'll bring this photo up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why I'm,</v>

3532
02:14:53.170 --> 02:14:54.610
<v Speaker 2>oh my phone's dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nevermind.</v>

3533
02:14:56.960 --> 02:14:57.260
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3534
02:14:57.260 --> 02:14:58.880
<v Speaker 2>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>technology fails me again.</v>

3535
02:14:59.270 --> 02:15:00.590
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

3536
02:15:00.591 --> 02:15:00.941
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3537
02:15:00.941 --> 02:15:01.330
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3538
02:15:01.330 --> 02:15:04.820
<v Speaker 2>the prime space in between,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget what the cutoff is.</v>

3539
02:15:04.821 --> 02:15:06.800
<v Speaker 2>I think they have to be over 80,</v>
<v Speaker 2>80 something inches.</v>

3540
02:15:06.801 --> 02:15:08.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure somebody can dial it and tell </v>
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>

3541
02:15:08.720 --> 02:15:10.760
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if it's not,</v>

3542
02:15:11.130 --> 02:15:13.190
<v Speaker 2>if it's not over that and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

3543
02:15:13.191 --> 02:15:16.340
<v Speaker 2>it's a little bit over that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you got to toss back in.</v>

3544
02:15:16.341 --> 02:15:19.760
<v Speaker 2>Cause there's still in prime fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>time and they'd produced more babies for</v>

3545
02:15:19.761 --> 02:15:20.310
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

3546
02:15:20.310 --> 02:15:21.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The really big ones.</v>

3547
02:15:21.511 --> 02:15:24.850
<v Speaker 1>So a buddy of mine got a huge one and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they cut the line on him.</v>

3548
02:15:25.210 --> 02:15:26.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were saying it's too big.</v>

3549
02:15:26.591 --> 02:15:27.550
<v Speaker 1>We got to let it go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>

3550
02:15:27.551 --> 02:15:28.920
<v Speaker 1>what in the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3551
02:15:29.060 --> 02:15:30.160
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's big enough,</v>

3552
02:15:30.220 --> 02:15:31.053
<v Speaker 1>then they can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you look at them and you think </v>

3553
02:15:32.771 --> 02:15:35.260
<v Speaker 1>that's gotta be big enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>80 inches.</v>

3554
02:15:35.261 --> 02:15:35.801
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I,</v>

3555
02:15:35.801 --> 02:15:36.160
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

3556
02:15:36.160 --> 02:15:38.250
<v Speaker 1>if this damn thing was working,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd show this photo of,</v>

3557
02:15:38.251 --> 02:15:39.390
<v Speaker 1>of scooter with his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

3558
02:15:39.400 --> 02:15:40.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his hell,</v>

3559
02:15:40.160 --> 02:15:44.560
<v Speaker 1>but we'll plug it in and charge it then </v>
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>

3560
02:15:46.030 --> 02:15:47.260
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

3561
02:15:47.620 --> 02:15:49.150
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know whether he had electricity</v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

3562
02:15:49.240 --> 02:15:50.260
<v Speaker 1>I need to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do.</v>

3563
02:15:50.280 --> 02:15:51.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how the lights are on.</v>

3564
02:15:51.700 --> 02:15:53.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

3565
02:15:53.111 --> 02:15:55.090
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how things work in Idaho.</v>

3566
02:15:55.540 --> 02:15:56.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a little different than,</v>

3567
02:15:57.950 --> 02:16:02.260
<v Speaker 1>but if 80 oh look at that size of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking thing.</v>

3568
02:16:02.261 --> 02:16:04.110
<v Speaker 1>Pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a beautiful one.</v>

3569
02:16:04.240 --> 02:16:05.073
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just pretend.</v>

3570
02:16:05.110 --> 02:16:05.950
<v Speaker 1>Just pretend my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3571
02:16:06.850 --> 02:16:10.390
<v Speaker 1>one of those kids is my kid pretty much </v>
<v Speaker 1>said wow,</v>

3572
02:16:10.420 --> 02:16:12.520
<v Speaker 1>they're enormous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if they're bigger than that,</v>

3573
02:16:12.550 --> 02:16:14.020
<v Speaker 1>they probably have to let them go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3574
02:16:14.050 --> 02:16:16.930
<v Speaker 1>if you get a fish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what happens is no,</v>

3575
02:16:16.931 --> 02:16:17.890
<v Speaker 1>but if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you catch it,</v>

3576
02:16:17.980 --> 02:16:20.680
<v Speaker 2>one that say is about a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>

3577
02:16:20.710 --> 02:16:25.450
<v Speaker 2>a s eight inches smaller than that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you got to toss it back in.</v>

3578
02:16:25.690 --> 02:16:27.880
<v Speaker 2>So the point being is you'll look at </v>
<v Speaker 2>something and think,</v>

3579
02:16:27.881 --> 02:16:29.360
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is definitely big enough catch.</v>

3580
02:16:29.361 --> 02:16:30.160
<v Speaker 2>And then you got to measure</v>

3581
02:16:30.160 --> 02:16:30.993
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if it's not over that 80 some odd </v>

3582
02:16:32.531 --> 02:16:34.300
<v Speaker 1>threshold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to chuck it back in.</v>

3583
02:16:34.480 --> 02:16:36.160
<v Speaker 1>But when you talk about efficiency that </v>
<v Speaker 1>big,</v>

3584
02:16:36.161 --> 02:16:37.750
<v Speaker 1>you think there's no way I got to toss </v>
<v Speaker 1>this back in.</v>

3585
02:16:37.751 --> 02:16:38.680
<v Speaker 1>But you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

3586
02:16:38.681 --> 02:16:40.290
<v Speaker 1>it's state law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>

3587
02:16:40.310 --> 02:16:41.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many,</v>

3588
02:16:41.350 --> 02:16:43.270
<v Speaker 1>what does 80 inches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's six foot.</v>

3589
02:16:43.290 --> 02:16:45.210
<v Speaker 1>One and a half feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Six and a half feet.</v>

3590
02:16:45.220 --> 02:16:46.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Geez.</v>

3591
02:16:46.680 --> 02:16:47.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

3592
02:16:47.741 --> 02:16:48.574
<v Speaker 1>Crazy fucking fishman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you just haul this and you can </v>

3593
02:16:50.261 --> 02:16:51.290
<v Speaker 1>imagine what it's like wine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3594
02:16:51.310 --> 02:16:52.600
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>400 feet down maybe.</v>

3595
02:16:52.630 --> 02:16:53.041
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3596
02:16:53.041 --> 02:16:55.060
<v Speaker 1>Cause you're down towards the bottom and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just kind of bang in the,</v>

3597
02:16:55.360 --> 02:16:56.193
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bait down there on the bottom and </v>

3598
02:16:56.951 --> 02:17:01.290
<v Speaker 1>you it up a door to a castle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

3599
02:17:01.680 --> 02:17:02.740
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at this.</v>

3600
02:17:02.800 --> 02:17:06.110
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I mean halibut or delicious.</v>

3601
02:17:06.120 --> 02:17:06.953
<v Speaker 1>It's really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we ended up with kind of like </v>

3602
02:17:07.901 --> 02:17:08.950
<v Speaker 1>what you're talking about when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3603
02:17:08.960 --> 02:17:09.820
<v Speaker 1>you're thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3604
02:17:09.821 --> 02:17:10.390
<v Speaker 1>what do you end up with?</v>

3605
02:17:10.390 --> 02:17:12.280
<v Speaker 1>Well I ended up with an entire freezer </v>
<v Speaker 1>just from one,</v>

3606
02:17:12.281 --> 02:17:14.380
<v Speaker 1>this one trip while entire freezer full </v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

3607
02:17:14.381 --> 02:17:16.330
<v Speaker 1>of salmon and halibut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty,</v>

3608
02:17:16.331 --> 02:17:18.670
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty taste.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you get to do it in Alaska,</v>

3609
02:17:18.671 --> 02:17:20.530
<v Speaker 1>which is one of my favorite places to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

3610
02:17:20.620 --> 02:17:25.240
<v Speaker 1>Alaska is just crazy that we stole that </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the Russians for like 15 bucks.</v>

3611
02:17:26.110 --> 02:17:28.030
<v Speaker 1>How much to we get it for cheaper than </v>
<v Speaker 1>Manhattan,</v>

3612
02:17:28.031 --> 02:17:28.864
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3613
02:17:28.900 --> 02:17:30.250
<v Speaker 1>I think it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3614
02:17:30.430 --> 02:17:31.990
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3615
02:17:31.991 --> 02:17:34.960
<v Speaker 1>Alaska and yellowstone to places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tell people all the time,</v>

3616
02:17:34.961 --> 02:17:38.310
<v Speaker 1>you gotta go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta go the $7 million.</v>

3617
02:17:38.500 --> 02:17:40.360
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was in 1867.</v>

3618
02:17:40.361 --> 02:17:41.560
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

3619
02:17:41.780 --> 02:17:42.790
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In current dollars.</v>

3620
02:17:42.791 --> 02:17:47.170
<v Speaker 1>So it'd be like $2 million but Manhattan</v>
<v Speaker 1>was like 15 bucks.</v>

3621
02:17:47.171 --> 02:17:49.240
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much of the,</v>

3622
02:17:49.270 --> 02:17:51.660
<v Speaker 1>they give the native Americans and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

3623
02:17:51.690 --> 02:17:53.680
<v Speaker 1>people were getting crazy written,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these stolen,</v>

3624
02:17:54.010 --> 02:17:54.843
<v Speaker 1>they're stolen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but apparently we paid the Russians </v>

3625
02:17:57.341 --> 02:17:58.440
<v Speaker 1>pretty well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we still,</v>

3626
02:17:58.510 --> 02:17:59.343
<v Speaker 1>we stole it from the $24 24 yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to remember it was </v>

3627
02:18:04.310 --> 02:18:07.450
<v Speaker 1>undeveloped at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm like Alaska,</v>

3628
02:18:07.770 --> 02:18:08.020
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>

3629
02:18:08.020 --> 02:18:13.020
<v Speaker 1>Alaska is still undeveloped years before</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Russians must be.</v>

3630
02:18:13.721 --> 02:18:16.600
<v Speaker 1>They sold that to us for 7 million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is so big.</v>

3631
02:18:16.601 --> 02:18:18.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean at least Manhattan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a fairly small,</v>

3632
02:18:18.760 --> 02:18:20.470
<v Speaker 1>but think about the Louisiana purchase,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3633
02:18:20.520 --> 02:18:21.353
<v Speaker 1>I don't think White Jefferson getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>that from Napoleon and I mean what that </v>

3634
02:18:23.831 --> 02:18:24.664
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it is crazy when you think how this </v>

3635
02:18:26.321 --> 02:18:27.154
<v Speaker 1>nation was cobbled together in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>foresight that talk the and the sort of </v>

3636
02:18:29.741 --> 02:18:30.910
<v Speaker 1>the just the balls of saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3637
02:18:30.911 --> 02:18:31.960
<v Speaker 1>we're going to take that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

3638
02:18:32.410 --> 02:18:34.330
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>15 million.</v>

3639
02:18:35.590 --> 02:18:40.590
<v Speaker 1>Approximately 4 cents an acre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like a fair price.</v>

3640
02:18:40.900 --> 02:18:45.670
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was purchased in a purchase treaty by</v>

3641
02:18:45.671 --> 02:18:46.504
<v Speaker 1>the Senate and October 20th of 1803 </v>
<v Speaker 1>doubled the size of the United States </v>

3642
02:18:49.810 --> 02:18:52.450
<v Speaker 1>and opened up the continent to its </v>
<v Speaker 1>westward expansion.</v>

3643
02:18:52.480 --> 02:18:54.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

3644
02:18:54.160 --> 02:18:56.800
<v Speaker 1>First thing they did was encourage </v>
<v Speaker 1>people move out there.</v>

3645
02:18:56.890 --> 02:18:58.390
<v Speaker 1>You've got to populate that place.</v>

3646
02:18:58.390 --> 02:18:59.530
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the whole plan.</v>

3647
02:18:59.560 --> 02:19:03.160
<v Speaker 1>Well one of the things that we saw when </v>
<v Speaker 1>we were in Montana for the first time,</v>

3648
02:19:03.220 --> 02:19:04.031
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the,</v>

3649
02:19:04.031 --> 02:19:07.960
<v Speaker 1>on the Missouri was you would saw these </v>
<v Speaker 1>homesteads where people tried to make it</v>

3650
02:19:07.961 --> 02:19:10.600
<v Speaker 1>out there and they realize you can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>grow anything out there.</v>

3651
02:19:10.601 --> 02:19:12.130
<v Speaker 1>Cause you know that Mudd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

3652
02:19:12.220 --> 02:19:13.630
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

3653
02:19:13.631 --> 02:19:15.880
<v Speaker 1>you can't til it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to grow anything in it.</v>

3654
02:19:15.881 --> 02:19:16.714
<v Speaker 1>Whatever's growing there is what grows </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and you're not going to grow </v>

3655
02:19:18.971 --> 02:19:20.920
<v Speaker 1>anything extra.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't have a farm there.</v>

3656
02:19:20.921 --> 02:19:23.260
<v Speaker 1>And people tried forever because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>just thought,</v>

3657
02:19:23.470 --> 02:19:24.303
<v Speaker 1>let me just find some ground and all you</v>
<v Speaker 1>gotta do is live there for a certain </v>

3658
02:19:26.381 --> 02:19:30.500
<v Speaker 1>amount of time that would be yours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's these really old broken down</v>

3659
02:19:30.501 --> 02:19:32.110
<v Speaker 1>houses from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3660
02:19:32.120 --> 02:19:32.953
<v Speaker 1>the 1,817 hundreds whenever people were </v>
<v Speaker 1>out there and you could still go there </v>

3661
02:19:36.291 --> 02:19:37.190
<v Speaker 1>and touch the wood.</v>

3662
02:19:37.190 --> 02:19:38.770
<v Speaker 1>It's really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can still see,</v>

3663
02:19:38.790 --> 02:19:40.660
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this homesteads like that out in</v>

3664
02:19:40.790 --> 02:19:41.830
<v Speaker 1>Idaho and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

3665
02:19:42.260 --> 02:19:44.720
<v Speaker 1>it is crazy when you think about people </v>
<v Speaker 1>making their way across,</v>

3666
02:19:44.750 --> 02:19:45.583
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We talked about how people are getting </v>

3667
02:19:45.981 --> 02:19:46.814
<v Speaker 1>softer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3668
02:19:46.820 --> 02:19:48.110
<v Speaker 1>Oh well that's why when people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3669
02:19:48.111 --> 02:19:50.420
<v Speaker 1>you'll see photos of people from those </v>
<v Speaker 1>days,</v>

3670
02:19:50.620 --> 02:19:52.040
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they look hard,</v>

3671
02:19:52.070 --> 02:19:52.400
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3672
02:19:52.400 --> 02:19:56.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean they puff life skinny faces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3673
02:19:56.001 --> 02:19:57.080
<v Speaker 1>And just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3674
02:19:57.081 --> 02:19:59.120
<v Speaker 1>they don't often look happy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

3675
02:19:59.121 --> 02:19:59.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were,</v>

3676
02:19:59.660 --> 02:20:00.493
<v Speaker 1>they were living a hard life and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>making their way across the country and </v>

3677
02:20:03.050 --> 02:20:04.760
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you imagine they just thinking,</v>

3678
02:20:04.810 --> 02:20:05.870
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck it,</v>

3679
02:20:05.900 --> 02:20:08.270
<v Speaker 1>this is as far as I can go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they just put up stakes there,</v>

3680
02:20:08.300 --> 02:20:08.810
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They said,</v>

3681
02:20:08.810 --> 02:20:10.160
<v Speaker 1>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll just build here.</v>

3682
02:20:10.490 --> 02:20:12.500
<v Speaker 1>And maybe it was good land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it wasn't.</v>

3683
02:20:12.890 --> 02:20:13.723
<v Speaker 1>But can you imagine when you get to that</v>
<v Speaker 1>point where you suddenly staring at the </v>

3684
02:20:16.461 --> 02:20:18.470
<v Speaker 1>rockies and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

3685
02:20:18.530 --> 02:20:21.140
<v Speaker 1>I got to cross this in those days?</v>

3686
02:20:21.200 --> 02:20:21.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

3687
02:20:21.650 --> 02:20:22.750
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the expansion there,</v>

3688
02:20:22.840 --> 02:20:24.950
<v Speaker 1>the western movement of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3689
02:20:25.070 --> 02:20:30.070
<v Speaker 1>there was a series called a </v>
<v Speaker 1>misogynistic,</v>

3690
02:20:30.291 --> 02:20:32.030
<v Speaker 1>but it was called the men who built </v>
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>

3691
02:20:32.390 --> 02:20:33.223
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or the men who the frontiers men or </v>

3692
02:20:34.461 --> 02:20:37.760
<v Speaker 1>something like that is misogynist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexist.</v>

3693
02:20:37.761 --> 02:20:40.850
<v Speaker 1>I know exact women didn't build anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>you asshole.</v>

<v Speaker 1>mending.</v>

3697
02:20:47.300 --> 02:20:47.810
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

3698
02:20:47.810 --> 02:20:48.643
<v Speaker 1>if that series was really good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a first one was the men who </v>

3699
02:20:50.541 --> 02:20:52.970
<v Speaker 1>built America and then they did another </v>
<v Speaker 1>series about the frontiersman.</v>

3700
02:20:52.971 --> 02:20:54.560
<v Speaker 1>And that ones is the one I'm thinking of</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

3701
02:20:54.561 --> 02:20:56.690
<v Speaker 1>I think there's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't five or six episodes to it.</v>

3702
02:20:56.990 --> 02:20:58.840
<v Speaker 1>I think it's on Netflix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3703
02:20:59.060 --> 02:21:00.350
<v Speaker 1>but it talks about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it goes,</v>

3704
02:21:00.351 --> 02:21:02.210
<v Speaker 1>it covers the whole thing here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it covers Davy,</v>

3705
02:21:02.211 --> 02:21:02.990
<v Speaker 1>Crockett,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Daniel Boone,</v>

3706
02:21:02.990 --> 02:21:04.930
<v Speaker 1>all the characters that you remember </v>
<v Speaker 1>hearing about it.</v>

3707
02:21:04.960 --> 02:21:06.800
<v Speaker 1>But it goes into real historical detail </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

3708
02:21:06.801 --> 02:21:08.520
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fascinating when you,</v>

3709
02:21:08.540 --> 02:21:09.373
<v Speaker 1>when you look at how this place was </v>
<v Speaker 1>cobbled together and quickly and </v>

3710
02:21:11.751 --> 02:21:13.820
<v Speaker 1>quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think about just a couple of hundred</v>

3711
02:21:13.820 --> 02:21:15.920
<v Speaker 1>years time and relation to the rest of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

3712
02:21:15.950 --> 02:21:18.290
<v Speaker 1>A couple of hundred years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things didn't change that much at all.</v>

3713
02:21:18.710 --> 02:21:19.341
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

3714
02:21:19.341 --> 02:21:22.210
<v Speaker 1>It remarkable story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

3715
02:21:22.220 --> 02:21:23.000
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3716
02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:25.070
<v Speaker 1>it's also you get an appreciation for </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of how we,</v>

3717
02:21:25.100 --> 02:21:26.650
<v Speaker 1>how we might have treated the native </v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans.</v>

3718
02:21:27.190 --> 02:21:28.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

3719
02:21:28.510 --> 02:21:29.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3720
02:21:29.540 --> 02:21:32.990
<v Speaker 1>A seven year old came home the other day</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a pail look in her face and I go,</v>

3721
02:21:32.991 --> 02:21:34.550
<v Speaker 1>what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

3722
02:21:34.551 --> 02:21:35.384
<v Speaker 1>I learned about the Donner Party today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hope fucking seven teaching kids about </v>

3723
02:21:40.281 --> 02:21:42.290
<v Speaker 1>the Donner Party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

3724
02:21:42.291 --> 02:21:43.250
<v Speaker 1>where are they die?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3725
02:21:43.251 --> 02:21:44.084
<v Speaker 1>the mountains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They tried to make it across during the </v>

3726
02:21:46.161 --> 02:21:48.260
<v Speaker 1>winter and they didn't make it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>choose it.</v>

3727
02:21:48.261 --> 02:21:49.670
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they ate each other,</v>

3728
02:21:49.910 --> 02:21:50.743
<v Speaker 1>they ate each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they're teaching my fucking seven </v>

3729
02:21:52.431 --> 02:21:56.360
<v Speaker 1>year old that people eat people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're playing Oregon trail back then,</v>

3730
02:21:56.361 --> 02:21:57.260
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3731
02:21:57.261 --> 02:21:59.090
<v Speaker 1>it's a video game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the video game violence.</v>

3732
02:22:01.140 --> 02:22:02.260
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

3733
02:22:02.340 --> 02:22:05.930
<v Speaker 1>just something about learning that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>could happen.</v>

3734
02:22:06.410 --> 02:22:07.243
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and did just a couple of hundred years </v>

3735
02:22:09.170 --> 02:22:10.350
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that long ago.</v>

3736
02:22:10.390 --> 02:22:11.390
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at Lewis and Clark,</v>

3737
02:22:11.720 --> 02:22:14.570
<v Speaker 1>look at what they did and what they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>wandering out into,</v>

3738
02:22:14.571 --> 02:22:15.404
<v Speaker 1>which they had no idea what they would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't know what the fuck was out </v>

3739
02:22:17.301 --> 02:22:20.690
<v Speaker 1>there in terms of predators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of natives.</v>

3740
02:22:20.691 --> 02:22:23.930
<v Speaker 1>They didn't know what was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to call one time from a production</v>

3741
02:22:23.931 --> 02:22:24.764
<v Speaker 1>company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to know whether I wanted to take </v>

3742
02:22:25.321 --> 02:22:28.410
<v Speaker 1>part in that and they wouldn't do a </v>
<v Speaker 1>series on it was on the Donner party.</v>

3743
02:22:28.570 --> 02:22:29.403
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to recreate that whole </v>

3744
02:22:30.660 --> 02:22:31.890
<v Speaker 1>expedition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3745
02:22:32.160 --> 02:22:33.540
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or I mean,</v>

3746
02:22:33.541 --> 02:22:34.374
<v Speaker 1>right down to the last thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything was supposed to be </v>

3747
02:22:35.491 --> 02:22:37.860
<v Speaker 1>historically accurate and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

3748
02:22:37.861 --> 02:22:40.980
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I listened to what they were doing and I</v>

3749
02:22:40.981 --> 02:22:44.550
<v Speaker 1>thought to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you very much.</v>

3750
02:22:44.640 --> 02:22:45.600
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

3751
02:22:45.660 --> 02:22:47.940
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't get myself excited about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

3752
02:22:47.941 --> 02:22:49.200
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it would be interesting,</v>

3753
02:22:49.560 --> 02:22:51.750
<v Speaker 1>but probably only interesting for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first couple of days.</v>

3754
02:22:52.080 --> 02:22:53.650
<v Speaker 1>And then you're thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

3755
02:22:53.940 --> 02:22:55.320
<v Speaker 1>why am I here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why am I here?</v>

3756
02:22:55.350 --> 02:22:56.183
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3757
02:22:56.280 --> 02:22:58.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean for the sake of a show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

3758
02:22:58.171 --> 02:22:59.640
<v Speaker 1>I think they've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they pulled it together.</v>

3759
02:22:59.641 --> 02:23:02.280
<v Speaker 1>I said I'd have to look and see what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're actually faked a bunch of shit.</v>

3760
02:23:02.360 --> 02:23:03.193
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those shows things don't go well like </v>

3761
02:23:06.140 --> 02:23:07.130
<v Speaker 1>Tom Defrank it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3762
02:23:07.180 --> 02:23:08.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the crew is always right there.</v>

3763
02:23:08.761 --> 02:23:13.110
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like bear grylls will I survive why</v>

3764
02:23:13.120 --> 02:23:17.640
<v Speaker 1>you might eat and hopefully your </v>
<v Speaker 1>cameraman does do so bear grylls.</v>

3765
02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:18.833
<v Speaker 1>It was a direct response to survivor man</v>
<v Speaker 1>refusing to fake things cause he did it </v>

3766
02:23:23.611 --> 02:23:26.710
<v Speaker 1>on the same network.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Les Stroud is a friend of mine and he</v>

3767
02:23:26.711 --> 02:23:28.230
<v Speaker 1>was telling me what happened.</v>

3768
02:23:28.620 --> 02:23:31.650
<v Speaker 1>They were trying to get him to fake </v>
<v Speaker 1>things and he was like,</v>

3769
02:23:31.651 --> 02:23:32.484
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go by myself with just </v>

3770
02:23:34.410 --> 02:23:37.290
<v Speaker 1>cameras and I'm going to fill myself </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually surviving.</v>

3771
02:23:37.460 --> 02:23:41.010
<v Speaker 1>And if you watch less,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll do a show where,</v>

3772
02:23:41.011 --> 02:23:42.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's out there for five,</v>

3773
02:23:42.271 --> 02:23:43.860
<v Speaker 1>six days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the end of those five days,</v>

3774
02:23:43.980 --> 02:23:46.410
<v Speaker 1>his cheeks are sunken in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He looks like shit.</v>

3775
02:23:46.560 --> 02:23:48.900
<v Speaker 1>He's barely sleeping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just eating.</v>

3776
02:23:48.901 --> 02:23:51.450
<v Speaker 1>Anything you can find sometimes not </v>
<v Speaker 1>eating for days.</v>

3777
02:23:52.100 --> 02:23:52.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3778
02:23:52.430 --> 02:23:53.720
<v Speaker 1>that'd be great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3779
02:23:53.730 --> 02:23:56.760
<v Speaker 1>Bear gcs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's all good in the Marietta is exactly</v>

3780
02:23:56.790 --> 02:23:59.210
<v Speaker 1>what's going to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3781
02:23:59.211 --> 02:24:03.480
<v Speaker 1>I felt bottled water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm off to the days inn on camera.</v>

3782
02:24:03.481 --> 02:24:04.314
<v Speaker 1>He's drinking his own piss and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>survival for roots soon as the camera's </v>

3783
02:24:08.791 --> 02:24:10.500
<v Speaker 1>like God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give me that twinkie.</v>

3784
02:24:10.570 --> 02:24:13.470
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember where he came out of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember what,</v>

3785
02:24:13.471 --> 02:24:16.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where he was in the British military.</v>

3786
02:24:16.680 --> 02:24:18.750
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to remember.</v>

3787
02:24:18.810 --> 02:24:22.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he was with the sps or sas</v>
<v Speaker 1>or anything like that.</v>

3788
02:24:22.111 --> 02:24:22.944
<v Speaker 1>I think I thought it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it wasn't a cs and thought </v>

3789
02:24:24.481 --> 02:24:26.280
<v Speaker 1>that's what they said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it was maybe,</v>

3790
02:24:26.281 --> 02:24:27.300
<v Speaker 1>but anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3791
02:24:27.301 --> 02:24:28.134
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're doing it for real and you </v>

3792
02:24:29.281 --> 02:24:31.270
<v Speaker 1>think about the amount of calories </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're burning,</v>

3793
02:24:31.300 --> 02:24:35.820
<v Speaker 1>what you need to replace and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>realize that's what it was all about.</v>

3794
02:24:36.030 --> 02:24:39.510
<v Speaker 1>People spent every waking hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3795
02:24:39.570 --> 02:24:42.390
<v Speaker 1>collecting food and water to keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves going.</v>

3796
02:24:42.550 --> 02:24:43.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was it.</v>

3797
02:24:43.590 --> 02:24:46.650
<v Speaker 1>Until you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever you have thoughts that when you</v>

3798
02:24:46.651 --> 02:24:47.484
<v Speaker 1>go on hunting trips,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you had to just hunt for </v>

3799
02:24:49.561 --> 02:24:51.390
<v Speaker 1>survival,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hunting trip,</v>

3800
02:24:51.391 --> 02:24:52.224
<v Speaker 1>you could easily go five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six days and not even see an animal if </v>

3801
02:24:55.351 --> 02:24:57.660
<v Speaker 1>you're in the wrong spot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to try to find them.</v>

3802
02:24:58.080 --> 02:25:00.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's many days where you go </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you don't see anything.</v>

3803
02:25:00.510 --> 02:25:02.460
<v Speaker 1>Like what if you're hungry that day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3804
02:25:02.490 --> 02:25:05.830
<v Speaker 1>tough shit up shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3805
02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:10.650
<v Speaker 1>And those people did that with muskets </v>
<v Speaker 1>and bows and arrows and tried to make it</v>

3806
02:25:10.651 --> 02:25:14.040
<v Speaker 1>across the country without any idea what</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fuck was in front of them.</v>

3807
02:25:14.070 --> 02:25:14.903
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lewis and Clark grind or Powell going </v>

3808
02:25:17.671 --> 02:25:18.504
<v Speaker 1>down the Colorado,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the amount of food they needed to </v>

3809
02:25:20.521 --> 02:25:22.390
<v Speaker 1>consume as an expedition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3810
02:25:22.400 --> 02:25:24.140

<v Speaker 2>I uh,</v>

3854
02:26:49.720 --> 02:26:51.380
<v Speaker 2>I came down with this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3855
02:26:51.540 --> 02:26:52.930
<v Speaker 2>it was like flu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like conditions.</v>

3856
02:26:53.110 --> 02:26:53.943
<v Speaker 2>People are fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope Mike tells us about his lyme </v>

3857
02:26:55.361 --> 02:26:59.050
<v Speaker 2>disease story and you just feel like </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolute shit.</v>

3858
02:26:59.050 --> 02:26:59.883
<v Speaker 2>It feels like a bad flu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I would go and I talked to a </v>

3859
02:27:02.351 --> 02:27:05.530
<v Speaker 2>couple of doctors there in Connecticut </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they were like,</v>

3860
02:27:05.590 --> 02:27:07.300
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a flow.</v>

3861
02:27:07.960 --> 02:27:08.621
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they couldn't,</v>

3862
02:27:08.621 --> 02:27:11.050
<v Speaker 2>they didn't diagnose it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then we go out,</v>

3863
02:27:11.051 --> 02:27:13.450
<v Speaker 2>we're out in Idaho.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We hadn't moved out there yet,</v>

3864
02:27:13.451 --> 02:27:17.860
<v Speaker 2>but we went skiing and we were in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ketchum and I go into a clinic because I</v>

3865
02:27:17.861 --> 02:27:18.694
<v Speaker 2>said it just not feeling any better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just gives this thing as this </v>

3866
02:27:20.441 --> 02:27:24.250
<v Speaker 2>lingering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I go into a clinic there and I talked</v>

3867
02:27:24.251 --> 02:27:25.084
<v Speaker 2>to the guy and it's a young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a doctor not too long out of medical </v>

<v Speaker 1>It's all but Connecticut is covered in </v>

3928
02:29:32.231 --> 02:29:32.731
<v Speaker 1>ticks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3929
02:29:32.731 --> 02:29:34.320
<v Speaker 1>I had no idea when we moved there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we had a,</v>

3930
02:29:34.321 --> 02:29:35.154
<v Speaker 1>we had a nice sell property and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't big pond out there and a little </v>

3931
02:29:37.471 --> 02:29:39.150
<v Speaker 1>stream running through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was very picturesque,</v>

3932
02:29:39.930 --> 02:29:42.840
<v Speaker 1>but it was also just covered in ticks </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we can do about that.</v>

3933
02:29:42.870 --> 02:29:43.620
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3934
02:29:43.620 --> 02:29:44.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3935
02:29:44.070 --> 02:29:45.640
<v Speaker 1>they'll go through and spray.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3936
02:29:45.660 --> 02:29:47.070
<v Speaker 1>but then you've got a part we can't let </v>
<v Speaker 1>the kids out.</v>

3937
02:29:47.400 --> 02:29:48.233
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3938
02:29:48.350 --> 02:29:50.420
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is the spray killing </v>
<v Speaker 1>besides the tech?</v>

3939
02:29:50.421 --> 02:29:51.140
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

3940
02:29:51.140 --> 02:29:52.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we don't,</v>

3941
02:29:52.290 --> 02:29:53.123
<v Speaker 1>we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't do anything like that out </v>

3942
02:29:53.701 --> 02:29:54.534
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3943
02:29:55.020 --> 02:29:56.760
<v Speaker 1>and it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not so bad out west,</v>

3944
02:29:56.761 --> 02:29:58.470
<v Speaker 1>but they still have it and they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>

3945
02:29:58.500 --> 02:29:59.550
<v Speaker 1>they don't have the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3946
02:29:59.551 --> 02:30:01.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same type.</v>

3947
02:30:01.281 --> 02:30:03.030
<v Speaker 1>So they certainly don't have this red </v>
<v Speaker 1>meat tick.</v>

3948
02:30:03.090 --> 02:30:04.920
<v Speaker 1>I had never heard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a new one at Stetson.</v>

3949
02:30:04.960 --> 02:30:06.060
<v Speaker 1>That's a creep show right there.</v>

3950
02:30:06.910 --> 02:30:09.030
<v Speaker 3>The discovered it within the last five </v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

3951
02:30:09.780 --> 02:30:10.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That wouldn't be good.</v>

3952
02:30:11.010 --> 02:30:12.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've given up a lot of red meat,</v>

3953
02:30:12.540 --> 02:30:13.840
<v Speaker 1>but now I'm not going to give up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3954
02:30:13.850 --> 02:30:15.540
<v Speaker 1>Don't threaten me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

3955
02:30:15.541 --> 02:30:19.800
<v Speaker 1>I eat less than I used to eat it all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did all the talking monsters.</v>

3956
02:30:20.340 --> 02:30:22.920
<v Speaker 1>I try to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try to cut back to some degree.</v>

3957
02:30:23.220 --> 02:30:24.510
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

3958
02:30:24.540 --> 02:30:25.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just for,</v>

3959
02:30:25.650 --> 02:30:27.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get a little bit older and a,</v>

3960
02:30:27.421 --> 02:30:30.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to watch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a family history of heart disease,</v>

3961
02:30:30.151 --> 02:30:33.540
<v Speaker 1>massive problem with heart disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My parents went um,</v>

3962
02:30:33.980 --> 02:30:34.870
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both uh,</v>

3963
02:30:34.871 --> 02:30:38.340
<v Speaker 1>that way one of my brothers has a </v>
<v Speaker 1>defibrillator and others got uh,</v>

3964
02:30:38.640 --> 02:30:40.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>several stents.</v>

3965
02:30:41.010 --> 02:30:43.230
<v Speaker 1>The others on heart medication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's just like,</v>

3966
02:30:43.231 --> 02:30:44.880
<v Speaker 1>it's part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's a family thing so you can try to</v>

3967
02:30:44.881 --> 02:30:45.714
<v Speaker 1>do what you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not giving it up just like I'm </v>

3968
02:30:47.131 --> 02:30:48.840
<v Speaker 1>not giving up my Martini.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you kidding me?</v>

3969
02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:52.570
<v Speaker 3>I really don't believe that red meat has</v>
<v Speaker 3>any effect on that.</v>

3970
02:30:52.571 --> 02:30:54.880
<v Speaker 3>I think it's processed carbohydrates and</v>
<v Speaker 3>sugar.</v>

3971
02:30:55.060 --> 02:30:55.893
<v Speaker 3>I think that's what it's all about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this comes from conversations with </v>

3972
02:30:58.120 --> 02:30:58.953
<v Speaker 3>real scientists and nutritionists and </v>
<v Speaker 3>people understand the actual studies </v>

3973
02:31:01.670 --> 02:31:02.503
<v Speaker 3>data there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is an issue combining </v>

3974
02:31:04.840 --> 02:31:09.840
<v Speaker 3>carbohydrates and simple refined </v>
<v Speaker 3>carbohydrates with red meat,</v>

3975
02:31:10.300 --> 02:31:12.850
<v Speaker 3>saturated fats by themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not an issue.</v>

3976
02:31:12.851 --> 02:31:15.970
<v Speaker 3>Saturated fats with high levels of </v>
<v Speaker 3>carbohydrates.</v>

3977
02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:17.370
<v Speaker 3>Definitely an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

3978
02:31:17.470 --> 02:31:18.303
<v Speaker 3>I just say interaction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See the interaction between the two of </v>

3979
02:31:20.911 --> 02:31:22.560
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Way Doctor Rhonda,</v>

3980
02:31:22.561 --> 02:31:23.394
<v Speaker 3>Patrick talked about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could get ahold of her and tried to </v>

3981
02:31:24.801 --> 02:31:27.000
<v Speaker 3>get her to do it again and explain it to</v>
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>

3982
02:31:27.270 --> 02:31:31.440
<v Speaker 3>but it's the interaction between </v>
<v Speaker 3>saturated fats and carbohydrates.</v>

3983
02:31:31.441 --> 02:31:32.274
<v Speaker 3>It's not saturated fats on themselves on</v>
<v Speaker 3>their own saturated fat like red meat </v>

3984
02:31:36.890 --> 02:31:40.980
<v Speaker 3>and and Oregon meat in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>extremely healthy for you,</v>

3985
02:31:41.140 --> 02:31:45.300
<v Speaker 3>very good for you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we're so it's so you.</v>

3986
02:31:45.330 --> 02:31:46.163
<v Speaker 3>People are so used to consuming sugar </v>
<v Speaker 3>and simple carbohydrates and processed </v>

3987
02:31:51.571 --> 02:31:55.710
<v Speaker 3>foods for fuel that your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your body just gets accustomed to it.</v>

3988
02:31:55.711 --> 02:31:59.550
<v Speaker 3>When you add saturated fat to process </v>
<v Speaker 3>carbohydrates and sugar,</v>

3989
02:31:59.551 --> 02:32:01.350
<v Speaker 3>that's when you become desperate when </v>
<v Speaker 3>get issues.</v>

3990
02:32:01.440 --> 02:32:03.870
<v Speaker 3>That's why a lot of these studies that </v>
<v Speaker 3>show that you know,</v>

3991
02:32:03.871 --> 02:32:08.871
<v Speaker 3>red meat increases heart disease.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If people eat red meat over four or five</v>

3992
02:32:09.151 --> 02:32:11.760
<v Speaker 3>times a week,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have higher instances of heart disease,</v>

3993
02:32:12.150 --> 02:32:15.930
<v Speaker 3>but they're not asking what are they </v>
<v Speaker 3>eating with the rich or the eating it in</v>

3994
02:32:15.931 --> 02:32:16.764
<v Speaker 3>a burger or they're eating it with fries</v>
<v Speaker 3>and shakes and because that's different </v>

3995
02:32:20.401 --> 02:32:25.401
<v Speaker 3>than eating a grass fed steak with </v>
<v Speaker 3>avocado and maybe a salad that's not bad</v>

3996
02:32:25.741 --> 02:32:26.790
<v Speaker 3>for you at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3997
02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:27.833
<v Speaker 3>it's an look if cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if red meat really gave people heart </v>

3998
02:32:31.801 --> 02:32:34.890
<v Speaker 3>disease and cancer and all these things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that people say there'd be no people.</v>

3999
02:32:35.010 --> 02:32:36.570
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because people have been eating red meat</v>

4000
02:32:36.571 --> 02:32:41.520
<v Speaker 3>from the beginning of time and literally</v>
<v Speaker 3>97% of the population eats me.</v>

4001
02:32:41.820 --> 02:32:43.380
<v Speaker 3>But people process this stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>differently.</v>

4002
02:32:43.410 --> 02:32:44.243
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4003
02:32:44.410 --> 02:32:45.243
<v Speaker 3>I try.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's processing all the different </v>

4004
02:32:47.730 --> 02:32:51.960
<v Speaker 3>preservatives that people put on in in </v>
<v Speaker 3>red meat and processed foods.</v>

4005
02:32:51.961 --> 02:32:52.794
<v Speaker 3>That's what's fucking people up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That and refined sugars and </v>

4006
02:32:55.471 --> 02:32:58.080
<v Speaker 3>carbohydrates do pay attention to </v>
<v Speaker 3>cholesterol issues.</v>

4007
02:32:58.081 --> 02:33:00.510
<v Speaker 3>I mean like is that something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not dietary cholesterol,</v>

4008
02:33:00.511 --> 02:33:02.460
<v Speaker 3>but neither does American heart </v>
<v Speaker 3>association.</v>

4009
02:33:02.760 --> 02:33:03.593
<v Speaker 3>You know they even weightwatchers now </v>
<v Speaker 3>says that dietary cholesterol has no </v>

4010
02:33:07.801 --> 02:33:12.240
<v Speaker 3>impact on your actual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like your actual blood cholesterol.</v>

4011
02:33:12.300 --> 02:33:14.730
<v Speaker 3>Weight watchers lets you eat as many </v>
<v Speaker 3>eggs as you want.</v>

4012
02:33:15.120 --> 02:33:19.260
<v Speaker 3>Eggs have a zero point system in </v>
<v Speaker 3>weightwatchers now.</v>

4013
02:33:19.370 --> 02:33:20.970
<v Speaker 3>Exos zero points.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4014
02:33:22.450 --> 02:33:23.283
<v Speaker 3>I've been doing that egg white thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody their whole life whites are </v>

4015
02:33:25.740 --> 02:33:27.970
<v Speaker 3>not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the good part is the oak.</v>

4016
02:33:28.340 --> 02:33:30.150
<v Speaker 3>You want the egg and the yolk together.</v>

4017
02:33:30.150 --> 02:33:31.140
<v Speaker 3>Proteins in the white,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4018
02:33:31.141 --> 02:33:34.890
<v Speaker 3>I mean no protein in the yolk too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They both have protein.</v>

4019
02:33:34.891 --> 02:33:36.790
<v Speaker 3>This is nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the cholesterol is in the,</v>

4020
02:33:36.860 --> 02:33:39.810
<v Speaker 3>in the Yolk in the yellow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's not bad for your cholesterol is</v>

4021
02:33:39.811 --> 02:33:41.940
<v Speaker 3>the building block for hormones?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4022
02:33:42.300 --> 02:33:46.500
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's just we get lied to from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>beginning of time when it comes to,</v>

4023
02:33:46.530 --> 02:33:47.363
<v Speaker 3>well first of all there's a lack of </v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding and then there's also the </v>

4024
02:33:50.311 --> 02:33:53.880
<v Speaker 3>studies that come out that are fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>funded by the sugar industry,</v>

4025
02:33:54.090 --> 02:33:54.923
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about that or the sugar industry paid </v>

4026
02:33:56.761 --> 02:34:01.710
<v Speaker 3>scientists to take the blame off of </v>
<v Speaker 3>sugar and put it on to saturated fat.</v>

4027
02:34:01.950 --> 02:34:03.870
<v Speaker 3>There was a whole New York Times article</v>
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>

4028
02:34:04.170 --> 02:34:09.170
<v Speaker 3>The sugar industry bribed scientist to </v>
<v Speaker 3>lie about the dangers of sugar is,</v>

4029
02:34:09.990 --> 02:34:11.700
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the difference between,</v>

4030
02:34:11.760 --> 02:34:13.380
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4031
02:34:13.410 --> 02:34:14.250
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even know what you'd call it.</v>

4032
02:34:14.250 --> 02:34:17.210
<v Speaker 3>Refined sugar and beet sugar is there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sarah,</v>

4033
02:34:17.380 --> 02:34:18.213
<v Speaker 3>there's difference in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's different sugars have a </v>

4034
02:34:20.981 --> 02:34:21.814
<v Speaker 3>different effect on like they have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lower glycemic index and and really </v>

4035
02:34:24.460 --> 02:34:27.430
<v Speaker 3>usually is dependent upon whether or not</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're connected to fiber.</v>

4036
02:34:27.460 --> 02:34:30.640
<v Speaker 3>Like sugar in the form of fruit is not </v>
<v Speaker 3>bad for you.</v>

4037
02:34:30.880 --> 02:34:34.470
<v Speaker 3>Like if you eat an apple,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's connected to fiber that the,</v>

4038
02:34:34.480 --> 02:34:36.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're eating the whole fruit.</v>

4039
02:34:36.011 --> 02:34:38.920
<v Speaker 3>That's what it's supposed to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how it's supposed to be consumed.</v>

4040
02:34:39.160 --> 02:34:42.400
<v Speaker 3>The real issue comes when you take that </v>
<v Speaker 3>sugar out of that fruit,</v>

4041
02:34:42.760 --> 02:34:45.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's high fructose corn syrup or</v>

4042
02:34:45.251 --> 02:34:47.320
<v Speaker 3>whatever the fuck y'all else you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting sugar from,</v>

4043
02:34:47.470 --> 02:34:48.303
<v Speaker 3>and then consume that sugar because then</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's sugar free of all the natural </v>

4044
02:34:52.271 --> 02:34:54.210
<v Speaker 3>things that contain it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4045
02:34:54.430 --> 02:34:56.890
<v Speaker 3>Fiber and the actual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4046
02:34:56.910 --> 02:34:57.910
<v Speaker 3>the tissue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

4047
02:34:57.911 --> 02:34:58.600
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4048
02:34:58.600 --> 02:35:00.650
<v Speaker 3>the actual fruit itself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

4049
02:35:00.651 --> 02:35:01.750
<v Speaker 3>the tissue of the fruit.</v>

4050
02:35:02.060 --> 02:35:02.970
<v Speaker 1>Well was the thing I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

4051
02:35:02.971 --> 02:35:05.340
<v Speaker 1>we tried to keep processed foods out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the house for the most part,</v>

4052
02:35:05.341 --> 02:35:06.174
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we try to keep the kids eating </v>

4053
02:35:07.740 --> 02:35:10.680
<v Speaker 1>healthy and all the things we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to do.</v>

4054
02:35:11.910 --> 02:35:14.100
<v Speaker 1>But it is interesting the sense that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4055
02:35:14.101 --> 02:35:16.140
<v Speaker 1>from an economic standpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

4056
02:35:16.170 --> 02:35:18.340
<v Speaker 1>Eating healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4057
02:35:18.900 --> 02:35:19.733
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4058
02:35:20.730 --> 02:35:21.563
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were advantaged if you're middle </v>

4059
02:35:23.731 --> 02:35:25.530
<v Speaker 1>class or upper class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4060
02:35:25.860 --> 02:35:27.010
<v Speaker 1>If you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4061
02:35:27.120 --> 02:35:29.760
<v Speaker 1>if you don't have the financial </v>
<v Speaker 1>wherewithal,</v>

4062
02:35:30.060 --> 02:35:31.830
<v Speaker 1>I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

4063
02:35:31.831 --> 02:35:32.664
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'm just blowing smoke up my ass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that there is something to </v>

4064
02:35:35.101 --> 02:35:35.970
<v Speaker 1>be said for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4065
02:35:35.971 --> 02:35:36.804
<v Speaker 1>cause if you're going and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking I'm going to eat organic and </v>

4066
02:35:37.981 --> 02:35:39.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna eat all these expensive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's expensive.</v>

4067
02:35:39.930 --> 02:35:41.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

4068
02:35:41.640 --> 02:35:42.241
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

4069
02:35:42.241 --> 02:35:43.074
<v Speaker 1>so you've got a group of people that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>disadvantaged in the nutrition side of </v>

4070
02:35:46.441 --> 02:35:50.670
<v Speaker 1>things because they ended up defaulting </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the process foods or the fast foods.</v>

4071
02:35:51.900 --> 02:35:53.280
<v Speaker 1>But I'm happy to hear about the red </v>
<v Speaker 1>meat.</v>

4072
02:35:53.310 --> 02:35:53.611
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4073
02:35:53.611 --> 02:35:54.444

<v Speaker 1>I'm going to say I can eat a steak </v>

4074
02:35:56.221 --> 02:35:58.440
<v Speaker 1>whenever I want and then I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get bit by this tick.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to stay.</v>

4076
02:36:01.040 --> 02:36:03.160
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>salmon is fantastic for that.</v>

4077
02:36:03.270 --> 02:36:04.650
<v Speaker 3>It's 100% true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And Luckily I,</v>

4089
02:36:26.260 --> 02:36:27.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're lucky our kids like fish,</v>

4090
02:36:27.911 --> 02:36:29.170
<v Speaker 1>they really like fishing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4091
02:36:29.320 --> 02:36:31.560
<v Speaker 1>there are a lot of their friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll come over for dinner.</v>

4092
02:36:31.990 --> 02:36:34.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't want fish was a little fucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4093
02:36:34.100 --> 02:36:35.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm not gonna have that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4094
02:36:35.270 --> 02:36:36.730
<v Speaker 1>and they want a burger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

4095
02:36:36.731 --> 02:36:38.200
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

4096
02:36:38.201 --> 02:36:38.970
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

4097
02:36:38.970 --> 02:36:39.520
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4098
02:36:39.520 --> 02:36:41.530
<v Speaker 1>we had a ton of fish because you catch a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of fish.</v>

4099
02:36:41.810 --> 02:36:43.170
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really good.</v>

4100
02:36:43.530 --> 02:36:44.363
<v Speaker 3>Kids get really addicted to bread to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>really addicted to hamburgers and </v>

4101
02:36:48.061 --> 02:36:50.590
<v Speaker 3>sandwiches and things with the carbs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

4102
02:36:50.600 --> 02:36:51.433
<v Speaker 3>it's about carbs with kids and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need a certain amount of carbs for </v>

4103
02:36:54.181 --> 02:36:56.190
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we way too much.</v>

4104
02:36:56.310 --> 02:36:56.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4105
02:36:56.850 --> 02:36:57.683
<v Speaker 3>In general.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that is most likely what's </v>

4106
02:36:59.581 --> 02:37:00.414
<v Speaker 3>responsible for heart disease.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most likely was responsible for the </v>

4107
02:37:02.641 --> 02:37:05.190
<v Speaker 3>overweight epidemic in America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's carbs.</v>

4108
02:37:05.870 --> 02:37:06.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can believe that.</v>

4109
02:37:06.721 --> 02:37:08.780
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do think that the people,</v>

4110
02:37:09.230 --> 02:37:12.110
<v Speaker 1>people react differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I should look at two people.</v>

4111
02:37:12.111 --> 02:37:12.944
<v Speaker 1>We've got the same diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to process it one way and I'm </v>

4112
02:37:14.251 --> 02:37:17.180
<v Speaker 1>going to end up with very high problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

4113
02:37:17.181 --> 02:37:18.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

4114
02:37:18.290 --> 02:37:20.000
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but bottom line is,</v>

4115
02:37:20.001 --> 02:37:21.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get to a certain point and you start</v>

4116
02:37:21.351 --> 02:37:22.184
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now I'm going to pay a little more </v>

4117
02:37:22.281 --> 02:37:23.660
<v Speaker 1>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's where I am in life.</v>

4118
02:37:23.661 --> 02:37:25.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm paying a little more attention to </v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm eating.</v>

4119
02:37:25.350 --> 02:37:28.220
<v Speaker 1>I'll pay a little more attention to my </v>
<v Speaker 1>regimen as far as you want to do for,</v>

4120
02:37:28.250 --> 02:37:29.083
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to send you some podcasts to </v>

4121
02:37:29.871 --> 02:37:30.930
<v Speaker 1>listen to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be good.</v>

4122
02:37:31.050 --> 02:37:31.883
<v Speaker 3>Give you a real understanding of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>actual science behind food versus the </v>

4123
02:37:36.811 --> 02:37:37.644
<v Speaker 3>misconceptions and versus the </v>
<v Speaker 3>misinformation because there's so much </v>

4124
02:37:39.841 --> 02:37:42.030
<v Speaker 3>of it out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there's so much,</v>

4125
02:37:42.070 --> 02:37:42.631
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4126
02:37:42.631 --> 02:37:43.464
<v Speaker 3>we've talked about this before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is probably a good thing to talk </v>

4127
02:37:45.631 --> 02:37:48.480
<v Speaker 3>about this now and I need to know what's</v>
<v Speaker 3>true and what's not true.</v>

4128
02:37:48.650 --> 02:37:50.820
<v Speaker 3>You remember when we talked about how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4129
02:37:50.850 --> 02:37:55.850
<v Speaker 3>the guy who started the atkins diet died</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he was 258 pounds and all that?</v>

4130
02:37:56.400 --> 02:37:57.233
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>apparently when he fell and hit his </v>

4131
02:37:59.071 --> 02:38:01.620
<v Speaker 3>head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had,</v>

4132
02:38:01.680 --> 02:38:02.513
<v Speaker 3>he had serious problems in the hospital </v>
<v Speaker 3>and gained somewhere around 50 pounds </v>

4133
02:38:08.041 --> 02:38:10.830
<v Speaker 3>while he was in the hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even more than 50 pounds.</v>

4134
02:38:11.010 --> 02:38:11.843
<v Speaker 3>I believe he has 195 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're saying when he was checked into </v>

4135
02:38:14.041 --> 02:38:18.060
<v Speaker 3>the hospital and his heart disease had </v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing to do with his diet,</v>

4136
02:38:18.061 --> 02:38:21.610
<v Speaker 3>it was a viral illness that caused his </v>
<v Speaker 3>heart to,</v>

4137
02:38:21.800 --> 02:38:22.633
<v Speaker 3>to fail.</v>

4138
02:38:22.860 --> 02:38:25.620
<v Speaker 3>And this was all related to organ </v>
<v Speaker 3>failure.</v>

4139
02:38:25.740 --> 02:38:29.310
<v Speaker 3>He had massive organ failure and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>massive,</v>

4140
02:38:29.311 --> 02:38:31.230
<v Speaker 3>a water retention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>

4141
02:38:31.231 --> 02:38:34.470
<v Speaker 3>because of his body was falling apart </v>
<v Speaker 3>while he was in the hospital.</v>

4142
02:38:34.950 --> 02:38:36.180
<v Speaker 3>So what's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the,</v>

4143
02:38:36.181 --> 02:38:37.350
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most people think he died.</v>

4144
02:38:37.351 --> 02:38:40.530
<v Speaker 3>How well most people think he died </v>
<v Speaker 3>falling and hitting his head,</v>

4145
02:38:40.531 --> 02:38:41.364
<v Speaker 3>which is true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the Vegan propaganda was that he </v>

4146
02:38:44.611 --> 02:38:48.030
<v Speaker 3>actually died of a heart attack and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had,</v>

4147
02:38:48.590 --> 02:38:51.180
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had was 258 pounds when he died.</v>

4148
02:38:51.181 --> 02:38:53.280
<v Speaker 3>So his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his diet didn't work.</v>

4149
02:38:53.281 --> 02:38:54.750
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're saying that no one,</v>

4150
02:38:54.751 --> 02:38:56.700
<v Speaker 3>he was checked into the hospital after </v>
<v Speaker 3>he hit his head.</v>

4151
02:38:56.701 --> 02:38:58.560
<v Speaker 3>He was only 195 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

4152
02:38:58.830 --> 02:39:02.280
<v Speaker 3>So all of this weight gain that they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>attributing to his diet,</v>

4153
02:39:02.340 --> 02:39:03.173
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're being disingenuous and </v>

4154
02:39:04.890 --> 02:39:05.723
<v Speaker 3>untruthful.</v>

4155
02:39:05.920 --> 02:39:07.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First thing you do when you check into a</v>

4156
02:39:07.371 --> 02:39:10.040
<v Speaker 1>hospital because you got to check </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself out as quickly as possible.</v>

4157
02:39:10.480 --> 02:39:11.313
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy,</v>

4158
02:39:11.760 --> 02:39:13.110
<v Speaker 3>you mean when you checked into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>hospital,</v>

4159
02:39:13.111 --> 02:39:13.944
<v Speaker 3>he was fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Apparently mean he fell and cracked his </v>

4160
02:39:15.721 --> 02:39:19.830
<v Speaker 3>head open on the ice and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wasn't a good scene.</v>

4161
02:39:20.040 --> 02:39:21.720
<v Speaker 3>And he was an older gentleman when it </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened.</v>

4162
02:39:21.721 --> 02:39:24.020
<v Speaker 3>I believe he was in his seventies okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

4163
02:39:24.280 --> 02:39:28.410
<v Speaker 3>but he died.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had massive organ failure and it was,</v>

4164
02:39:29.130 --> 02:39:29.963
<v Speaker 3>so somebody sent me something yesterday </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it so that whatever is heart </v>

4165
02:39:33.331 --> 02:39:34.164
<v Speaker 3>disease was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was not from like hardening of the </v>

4166
02:39:36.871 --> 02:39:38.790
<v Speaker 3>arteries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from cholesterol,</v>

4167
02:39:38.791 --> 02:39:41.730
<v Speaker 3>from eating all that food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

4168
02:39:41.900 --> 02:39:42.733
<v Speaker 3>It's so hard to understand what's right </v>
<v Speaker 3>and what's wrong too because people get </v>

4169
02:39:44.911 --> 02:39:47.730
<v Speaker 3>so ideological about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially vegans,</v>

4170
02:39:48.110 --> 02:39:49.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

4171
02:39:49.141 --> 02:39:49.974
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and even some meat eaters get </v>

4172
02:39:50.820 --> 02:39:51.653
<v Speaker 3>ideological about it and they just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people aren't looking at the real </v>

4173
02:39:54.271 --> 02:39:56.370
<v Speaker 3>relationship between food and health.</v>

4174
02:39:56.550 --> 02:39:58.170
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got a few people in my family who are</v>

4175
02:39:59.850 --> 02:40:01.470
<v Speaker 1>Vegan and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

4176
02:40:01.471 --> 02:40:02.730
<v Speaker 1>it's a little religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4177
02:40:02.731 --> 02:40:03.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're wonderful people.</v>

4178
02:40:03.721 --> 02:40:04.620
<v Speaker 1>They're great people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

4179
02:40:04.920 --> 02:40:06.090
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to this,</v>

4180
02:40:06.091 --> 02:40:08.130
<v Speaker 1>it's a little bit of a religious thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>for them.</v>

4181
02:40:08.190 --> 02:40:10.770
<v Speaker 1>And I'm staff like ideological.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4182
02:40:11.040 --> 02:40:11.873
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want to think there's only one way </v>

4183
02:40:12.941 --> 02:40:14.160
<v Speaker 3>and that's to be plant based.</v>

4184
02:40:14.160 --> 02:40:15.510
<v Speaker 1>It cures all diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

4185
02:40:15.590 --> 02:40:16.171
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fix it.</v>

4186
02:40:16.171 --> 02:40:17.004
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I've had people that have gone </v>

4187
02:40:17.641 --> 02:40:18.474
<v Speaker 1>Vegan and they got sick and they had bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>blood work and Sam Harris is one of </v>

4188
02:40:22.231 --> 02:40:23.310
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He tried it for a little while.</v>

4189
02:40:23.311 --> 02:40:25.680
<v Speaker 1>I tried to for quite a while and he did </v>
<v Speaker 1>it the right way and he just,</v>

4190
02:40:25.740 --> 02:40:27.120
<v Speaker 1>he got ill from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4191
02:40:27.121 --> 02:40:27.661
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4192
02:40:27.661 --> 02:40:30.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big fan of moderation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>moderation and everything.</v>

4193
02:40:30.390 --> 02:40:31.200
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean just,</v>

4194
02:40:31.200 --> 02:40:31.491
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

4195
02:40:31.491 --> 02:40:32.324
<v Speaker 1>that seems to be a reasonable attitude I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think in terms of when it comes to your </v>

4196
02:40:35.551 --> 02:40:36.270
<v Speaker 1>diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4197
02:40:36.270 --> 02:40:37.950
<v Speaker 1>And just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a,</v>

4198
02:40:38.070 --> 02:40:38.903
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4199
02:40:39.500 --> 02:40:42.390
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try not to overthink anything in,</v>

4200
02:40:42.391 --> 02:40:43.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in life and we,</v>

4201
02:40:43.750 --> 02:40:45.360
<v Speaker 1>we just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4202
02:40:45.361 --> 02:40:48.960
<v Speaker 1>we're in that point in society where </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe because it is,</v>

4203
02:40:48.990 --> 02:40:49.823
<v Speaker 1>things are easy and we have made it easy</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of technology and everything </v>

4204
02:40:52.351 --> 02:40:56.150
<v Speaker 1>else that we were able to just analyze </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything to fucking fair.</v>

4205
02:40:56.160 --> 02:40:56.880
<v Speaker 1>They will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4206
02:40:56.880 --> 02:40:59.550
<v Speaker 1>So I'm just thinking maybe it's not that</v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated.</v>

4207
02:40:59.640 --> 02:41:00.331
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

4208
02:41:00.331 --> 02:41:01.530
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4209
02:41:01.531 --> 02:41:03.420
<v Speaker 1>you work out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you burn more than you take in,</v>

4210
02:41:03.720 --> 02:41:04.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you try to eat healthy,</v>

4211
02:41:04.981 --> 02:41:06.270
<v Speaker 1>you stick to the basics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4212
02:41:06.271 --> 02:41:07.104
<v Speaker 1>grains and fruits and vegetables and </v>
<v Speaker 1>meeting granted a fucking terrible for </v>

4213
02:41:10.021 --> 02:41:10.500
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

4214
02:41:10.500 --> 02:41:11.310
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that.</v>

4215
02:41:11.310 --> 02:41:13.140
<v Speaker 1>I always say grains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody told me grains.</v>

4216
02:41:13.200 --> 02:41:16.710
<v Speaker 1>Grains are not good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most grains are bullshit.</v>

4217
02:41:16.740 --> 02:41:18.540
<v Speaker 1>You're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just carbohydrates.</v>

4218
02:41:18.600 --> 02:41:19.950
<v Speaker 1>High nuts and seeds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about nuts?</v>

4219
02:41:19.960 --> 02:41:21.720
<v Speaker 1>Vegetables?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not so great.</v>

4220
02:41:21.870 --> 02:41:24.060
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seeds are great vegetables.</v>

4221
02:41:24.330 --> 02:41:26.340
<v Speaker 1>Almonds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almonds are fantastic.</v>

4222
02:41:26.341 --> 02:41:28.230
<v Speaker 1>See I eat a ton of almonds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4223
02:41:28.231 --> 02:41:30.510
<v Speaker 1>look at that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I need calories to,</v>

4224
02:41:31.080 --> 02:41:31.741
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there you go.</v>

4225
02:41:31.741 --> 02:41:34.390
<v Speaker 1>They are good calories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Healthy fats are,</v>

4226
02:41:34.391 --> 02:41:35.930
<v Speaker 1>we used to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were times when if you,</v>

4227
02:41:35.960 --> 02:41:36.793
<v Speaker 1>if we're traveling or whatever and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>were sitting in some safe out somewhere </v>

4228
02:41:39.390 --> 02:41:40.223
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just waiting for something to happen </v>

4229
02:41:41.611 --> 02:41:43.860
<v Speaker 1>or just happened to be holed up for </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever reason.</v>

4230
02:41:44.490 --> 02:41:46.530
<v Speaker 1>And there was like nothing in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4231
02:41:46.531 --> 02:41:47.364
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember times when I would eat </v>

4232
02:41:48.211 --> 02:41:50.640
<v Speaker 1>oatmeal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was all I would eat.</v>

4233
02:41:50.641 --> 02:41:51.474
<v Speaker 1>Cause that's all it was available.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you'd eat oatmeal for like three </v>

4234
02:41:53.161 --> 02:41:54.120
<v Speaker 1>weeks in a row,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

4235
02:41:54.121 --> 02:41:54.954
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you were waiting to get on the </v>

4236
02:41:55.891 --> 02:41:58.500
<v Speaker 1>road and move and you'd had an access to</v>
<v Speaker 1>other foods,</v>

4237
02:41:58.750 --> 02:41:59.201
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think of,</v>

4238
02:41:59.201 --> 02:42:01.080
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot of oatmeal or something.</v>

4239
02:42:01.081 --> 02:42:02.100
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I developed,</v>

4240
02:42:02.101 --> 02:42:03.710
<v Speaker 1>when I was younger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd developed sort of this attitude.</v>

4241
02:42:03.790 --> 02:42:04.890
<v Speaker 1>It's just fuel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

4242
02:42:04.891 --> 02:42:06.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep moving forward so you've got to eat</v>

4243
02:42:06.541 --> 02:42:07.374
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so for a long time I didn't really </v>

4244
02:42:09.661 --> 02:42:11.760
<v Speaker 1>put much stock in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it tastes great or it's,</v>

4245
02:42:11.761 --> 02:42:12.301
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

4246
02:42:12.301 --> 02:42:14.650
<v Speaker 1>it's really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just more,</v>

4247
02:42:14.730 --> 02:42:15.563
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got to consume something to keep moving </v>

4248
02:42:16.680 --> 02:42:18.240
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4249
02:42:18.320 --> 02:42:19.710
<v Speaker 1>and so it's only,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it hasn't been,</v>

4250
02:42:19.740 --> 02:42:20.710
<v Speaker 1>it's been recent one.</v>

4251
02:42:20.710 --> 02:42:22.590
<v Speaker 1>I've really got to get focused on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4252
02:42:22.620 --> 02:42:25.290
<v Speaker 1>what do you have to do to you when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got little kids?</v>

4253
02:42:25.291 --> 02:42:26.640
<v Speaker 1>You know what it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to stick around,</v>

4254
02:42:26.670 --> 02:42:27.940
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

4255
02:42:28.520 --> 02:42:30.390
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to send you some podcasts.</v>

4256
02:42:30.420 --> 02:42:31.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you cook?</v>

4257
02:42:32.190 --> 02:42:33.023
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

4258
02:42:33.030 --> 02:42:34.340
<v Speaker 1>oddly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to cook now.</v>

4259
02:42:34.750 --> 02:42:36.630
<v Speaker 1>I live well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4260
02:42:38.070 --> 02:42:38.903
<v Speaker 1>most people would assume if I can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>operate my watch that I can't turn the </v>

4261
02:42:41.131 --> 02:42:42.580
<v Speaker 1>stove on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4262
02:42:42.600 --> 02:42:43.780
<v Speaker 1>but I can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

4263
02:42:43.781 --> 02:42:45.840
<v Speaker 1>and I find it actually a lot of fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4264
02:42:45.841 --> 02:42:47.310
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's stress relieving.</v>

4265
02:42:47.400 --> 02:42:50.790
<v Speaker 1>It's very satisfying to sit down to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>meal that you prepared yourself,</v>

4266
02:42:51.040 --> 02:42:51.873
<v Speaker 1>especially if you grow your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>vegetables and pull them out of the </v>

4267
02:42:53.641 --> 02:42:54.570
<v Speaker 1>garden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we do.</v>

4268
02:42:54.571 --> 02:42:56.880
<v Speaker 1>My wife has a great little vegetable </v>
<v Speaker 1>garden and,</v>

4269
02:42:56.881 --> 02:42:57.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we do that.</v>

4270
02:42:57.751 --> 02:43:00.360
<v Speaker 1>We have a few fruit trees and so that's </v>

<v Speaker 1>I like things to be the way they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be.</v>

4280
02:43:13.691 --> 02:43:15.730
<v Speaker 1>I like to clean up or while I'm doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>things right.</v>

4300
02:43:51.101 --> 02:43:54.160
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you could do it that day </v>
<v Speaker 1>at camp fire.</v>

4301
02:43:54.190 --> 02:43:56.710
