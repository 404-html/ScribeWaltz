104
00:04:40.931 --> 00:04:45.931
<v Speaker 4>another I installed my operating system </v>
<v Speaker 4>onto one of those big drives where those</v>

<v Speaker 4>big stupid drives remember those things?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

<v Speaker 4>That became my startup drive.</v>

112
00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.210
<v Speaker 4>I installed windows and then it took </v>
<v Speaker 4>like four days for your computer to boot</v>

113
00:05:07.211 --> 00:05:07.390
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>

114
00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:12.420
<v Speaker 4>Wouldn't boot up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was just chaos and so I had to bring </v>

115
00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.791
<v Speaker 4>it into a guy who was a pc expert who </v>
<v Speaker 4>figured out what the fuck I would </v>

116
00:05:14.791 --> 00:05:18.601

117
00:05:18.601 --> 00:05:19.660
<v Speaker 4>and he's a billionaire now.</v>

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.000
<v Speaker 4>technology's built money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

00:05:22.001 --> 00:05:27.001
<v Speaker 4>Like anytime you have something like six</v>
<v Speaker 4>months later there's a new version that </v>

120
00:05:27.001 --> 00:05:27.001
<v Speaker 4>comes out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>

121
00:05:27.001 --> 00:05:27.001
<v Speaker 4>damn,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to upgrade this.</v>

122
00:05:27.001 --> 00:05:28.630
<v Speaker 4>They say that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't see it that way.</v>

123
00:05:28.631 --> 00:05:33.631
<v Speaker 4>I think it's exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think of like people folks </v>

124
00:05:33.631 --> 00:05:33.631
<v Speaker 4>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

125
00:05:33.631 --> 00:05:35.830
<v Speaker 4>fucking the new shoots coming out and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they build it that way.</v>

126
00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:37.780
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're just trying to catch up with the</v>

127
00:05:37.781 --> 00:05:42.781
<v Speaker 4>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think technology is moving at such a </v>

128
00:05:42.781 --> 00:05:42.940
<v Speaker 4>fucking insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got guys at work,</v>

129
00:05:42.941 --> 00:05:43.840
<v Speaker 4>they have kids right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My,</v>

130
00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.580
<v Speaker 4>my buddy Lee,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's one of our designers.</v>

131
00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:47.560
<v Speaker 4>He pulled his daughter aside and he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

132
00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:52.890
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>things have gotten pretty cool in my </v>

133
00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:54.271
<v Speaker 4>lifetime.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have absolutely no idea the things </v>

134
00:05:54.271 --> 00:05:55.090
<v Speaker 4>you're in for like where the world is </v>
<v Speaker 4>going like the world in 10,</v>

135
00:05:55.091 --> 00:06:00.091
<v Speaker 4>15 years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be completely </v>

136
00:06:00.091 --> 00:06:00.091
<v Speaker 4>unrecognizable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I agree.</v>

137
00:06:00.091 --> 00:06:00.091
<v Speaker 4>It's</v>

138
00:06:00.091 --> 00:06:00.740
<v Speaker 5>like from where we were as kids,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you can't even imagine,</v>

139
00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:02.840
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like with nanotechnology and everything.</v>

140
00:06:02.841 --> 00:06:04.150
<v Speaker 5>It's unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You and I,</v>

141
00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:09.200
<v Speaker 5>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you and I've had this conversation a </v>

142
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.931
<v Speaker 5>couple of times and one of the things </v>
<v Speaker 5>that you turned me onto his fucking </v>

143
00:06:10.931 --> 00:06:10.931
<v Speaker 5>three d printers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

144
00:06:10.931 --> 00:06:15.190
<v Speaker 5>The idea that you're going to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 5>have certain elements inside of a </v>

145
00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:18.831
<v Speaker 5>machine and you're going to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 5>print objects we've talked about on the </v>

146
00:06:18.831 --> 00:06:21.941
<v Speaker 5>podcast before,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that you're not going to have to go to </v>

147
00:06:21.941 --> 00:06:22.490
<v Speaker 5>stores to buy things no more than you </v>
<v Speaker 5>have to go to stores to get a picture.</v>

148
00:06:22.491 --> 00:06:27.491
<v Speaker 5>You can download a picture.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I already hate going to the store now </v>

149
00:06:27.491 --> 00:06:27.491
<v Speaker 5>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you know,</v>

150
00:06:27.491 --> 00:06:30.670
<v Speaker 5>you go to big box retail,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it takes like 45 minutes to find what </v>

151
00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:30.670
<v Speaker 5>you want.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like okay,</v>

152
00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:33.911
<v Speaker 5>so now I use Amazon,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if I can actually have a fabricator </v>

153
00:06:33.911 --> 00:06:33.911
<v Speaker 5>at my house,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they can print out a pen like fine,</v>

154
00:06:33.911 --> 00:06:33.911
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

155
00:06:33.911 --> 00:06:34.430
<v Speaker 5>Because they have the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have the,</v>

156
00:06:34.431 --> 00:06:37.340
<v Speaker 5>like the wooden type ones right now that</v>
<v Speaker 5>kind of printed out of kind of like a,</v>

157
00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:38.790
<v Speaker 5>like shaved material.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

158
00:06:38.791 --> 00:06:43.791
<v Speaker 5>And you can just send him a three d </v>
<v Speaker 5>studio object and then they have metal </v>

159
00:06:43.791 --> 00:06:43.791
<v Speaker 5>ones were just building metal object </v>
<v Speaker 5>just layer by layer.</v>

160
00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:47.470
<v Speaker 5>And then eventually it's going to be the</v>
<v Speaker 5>way to manipulate whatever atoms,</v>

161
00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.160
<v Speaker 5>molecules to build whatever you want out</v>
<v Speaker 5>of it.</v>

162
00:06:49.161 --> 00:06:51.740
<v Speaker 5>It's unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's coming online man.</v>

163
00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:53.210
<v Speaker 5>And smart dust we were talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

164
00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:55.250
<v Speaker 5>That was another thing that you sent me </v>
<v Speaker 5>hip to.</v>

165
00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.420
<v Speaker 5>It was um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the.</v>

166
00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:59.390
<v Speaker 5>Well explain the whole thing for people </v>
<v Speaker 5>who don't know what smart does at a very</v>

167
00:06:59.391 --> 00:07:00.530
<v Speaker 5>high level,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because again,</v>

168
00:07:00.531 --> 00:07:03.140
<v Speaker 5>I'm a bit of a luddite despite what I do</v>
<v Speaker 5>for living a,</v>

169
00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:08.170
<v Speaker 5>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this kind of dust that they're able to </v>

170
00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:09.881
<v Speaker 5>sprinkle out in the battlefield that </v>
<v Speaker 5>each one has a little bit of a </v>

171
00:07:09.881 --> 00:07:09.881
<v Speaker 5>transmitter on it and they can detect if</v>
<v Speaker 5>anybody walks on it,</v>

172
00:07:09.881 --> 00:07:14.141
<v Speaker 5>like any sort of footstep patterns on it</v>
<v Speaker 5>because it essentially creates a little </v>

173
00:07:14.141 --> 00:07:14.141
<v Speaker 5>network that then sends back to base.</v>

174
00:07:14.141 --> 00:07:18.940
<v Speaker 5>And then what happens is it can also </v>
<v Speaker 5>kind of catching peoples' shoes and a </v>

175
00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:18.940
<v Speaker 5>little bit to their clothing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

176
00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:22.470
<v Speaker 5>there's just like little DNA bits you </v>
<v Speaker 5>would find with pieces of hair and a </v>

177
00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:22.470
<v Speaker 5>crime scene and they can track whoever </v>
<v Speaker 5>actually has that autumn right.</v>

178
00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:28.710
<v Speaker 5>Combined where technology's going with </v>
<v Speaker 5>the connectivity we have in the world </v>

179
00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:28.710
<v Speaker 5>and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's really scary,</v>

180
00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:29.180
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We talked about the end of privacy as we</v>

181
00:07:29.181 --> 00:07:29.750
<v Speaker 5>know it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

182
00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:31.550
<v Speaker 5>How big are these things now?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're tiny.</v>

183
00:07:31.551 --> 00:07:36.551
<v Speaker 5>The size of a small grain of sand Motha </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucker and I don't know how many are </v>

184
00:07:36.551 --> 00:07:36.551
<v Speaker 5>actually out there yet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

185
00:07:36.551 --> 00:07:38.510
<v Speaker 5>Like how much sand you get in your shoes</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you go to the beach.</v>

186
00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:40.070
<v Speaker 5>I got a lot to you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Imagine.</v>

187
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.200
<v Speaker 5>Could you imagine if all that sand.</v>

188
00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:45.440
<v Speaker 1>You probably already have this right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the time we know about it,</v>

189
00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:47.450
<v Speaker 1>I've always said about by the time we </v>
<v Speaker 1>hear about it,</v>

190
00:07:47.451 --> 00:07:50.070
<v Speaker 1>that's been in use for years when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about clones in my.</v>

191
00:07:50.071 --> 00:07:52.040
<v Speaker 1>By the time they tell you they've cloned</v>
<v Speaker 1>the person,</v>

192
00:07:52.041 --> 00:07:53.750
<v Speaker 1>the guy telling you is probably a clone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

193
00:07:53.751 --> 00:07:55.180
<v Speaker 1>I wonder how many technology role</v>

194
00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:59.580
<v Speaker 5>totally used by the government that if </v>
<v Speaker 5>your average person knew about it,</v>

195
00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:00.030
<v Speaker 5>result.</v>

196
00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:05.550
<v Speaker 1>It's in the body spray.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've gotten whole body sprays only for </v>

197
00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:12.560
<v Speaker 1>douchebags.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why they want to track douchebag </v>

198
00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:12.560
<v Speaker 1>activity thing when they step outside of</v>
<v Speaker 1>chimps,</v>

199
00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.230
<v Speaker 1>when they do like medical studies on </v>
<v Speaker 1>chimps,</v>

200
00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:19.440
<v Speaker 1>test out Mascara on them and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what the old spice guy there </v>

201
00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:19.440
<v Speaker 1>in the bathroom there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

202
00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm an old spice guy or whatever's </v>
<v Speaker 1>cheapest.</v>

203
00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:23.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever gets the job done and it has to</v>

204
00:08:23.141 --> 00:08:23.780
<v Speaker 1>be white.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>

205
00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:27.100
<v Speaker 1>I need white deodorant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The blue kind.</v>

206
00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:29.650
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you work?</v>

207
00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:31.370
<v Speaker 1>Do you do the antiperspirant?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

208
00:08:31.371 --> 00:08:36.371
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's a good thing for </v>

209
00:08:36.371 --> 00:08:36.371
<v Speaker 1>your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry.</v>

210
00:08:36.371 --> 00:08:38.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I stink sometimes,</v>

211
00:08:38.501 --> 00:08:39.870
<v Speaker 1>but I don't mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

212
00:08:39.871 --> 00:08:44.871
<v Speaker 1>What's important to me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was important to me that they don't </v>

213
00:08:44.871 --> 00:08:44.871
<v Speaker 1>clog my pores up when they're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>leak out sweat.</v>

214
00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:50.100
<v Speaker 1>What is that about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your just gumming up your pores like </v>

215
00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:53.640
<v Speaker 1>sweat doesn't come out plugging them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're using some sort of fucking nasty </v>

216
00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:54.100
<v Speaker 1>chemical that Jack's your whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your whole system.</v>

217
00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:56.010

<v Speaker 6>I'm not scared of my sweat doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 6>bother me.</v>

221
00:09:02.941 --> 00:09:05.210
<v Speaker 6>I'm sweaty all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You do,</v>

222
00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:10.220
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the problem with once you start </v>

223
00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:10.220
<v Speaker 6>working at a body cam.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So Harry,</v>

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:23.400
<v Speaker 6>the way it starts itching and it gets </v>
<v Speaker 6>caught in Jujitsu.</v>

229
00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.410
<v Speaker 6>People pull your chest hair so you don't</v>
<v Speaker 6>wear deodorant,</v>

00:09:30.791 --> 00:09:33.020
<v Speaker 6>I'm like ready for the French Riviera </v>
<v Speaker 6>Joe.</v>

235
00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:35.520
<v Speaker 6>I don't shave my legs though.</v>

236
00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:40.540
<v Speaker 6>I have no excuse to shave my legs.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know some dudes who do because it gets</v>

237
00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:41.670
<v Speaker 6>you out of submissions.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Easier.</v>

238
00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:42.560
<v Speaker 6>Jujitsu guys,</v>
<v Speaker 6>while.</v>

239
00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:43.810
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're still hardcore into that.</v>

240
00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:44.670
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's fine.</v>

241
00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:49.710
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What do you think this was at kraft </v>

242
00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:51.440
<v Speaker 6>mega?</v>
<v Speaker 6>The crap out of that is really fighting </v>

243
00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:54.171
<v Speaker 6>techniques.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think if you wanted to just learn it </v>

244
00:09:54.171 --> 00:09:56.810
<v Speaker 6>for self defense,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's a good system because what they do </v>

245
00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:59.481
<v Speaker 6>is they incorporate a lot of the best </v>
<v Speaker 6>techniques and ground fighting and they </v>

246
00:09:59.481 --> 00:10:02.271
<v Speaker 6>incorporate a lot of the best techniques</v>
<v Speaker 6>to stand up for someone just looking to </v>

247
00:10:02.271 --> 00:10:02.700
<v Speaker 6>defend themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It gives you a pretty comprehensive view</v>

248
00:10:02.701 --> 00:10:05.040
<v Speaker 6>of mixed of martial arts in general.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Look it up on Youtube,</v>

249
00:10:05.041 --> 00:10:07.170
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like half the videos or like how to</v>

250
00:10:07.171 --> 00:10:12.171
<v Speaker 6>get out of a gun situation and half of </v>
<v Speaker 6>them are like legit guys through real </v>

251
00:10:12.171 --> 00:10:12.171
<v Speaker 6>fast.</v>

252
00:10:12.171 --> 00:10:12.270
<v Speaker 6>The other half of white up dead.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

253
00:10:12.271 --> 00:10:13.230
<v Speaker 6>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But you know what?</v>

254
00:10:13.231 --> 00:10:14.820
<v Speaker 6>At least you have a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know?</v>

255
00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:19.880
<v Speaker 6>It's like if you have an idea of what to</v>
<v Speaker 6>do and someone was trying to get get you</v>

256
00:10:19.981 --> 00:10:24.981
<v Speaker 6>with a gun,</v>
<v Speaker 6>most likely they're going to fucking </v>

257
00:10:24.981 --> 00:10:24.981
<v Speaker 6>shoot you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

258
00:10:24.981 --> 00:10:24.981
<v Speaker 6>But at least you have some sort of an </v>
<v Speaker 6>idea.</v>

259
00:10:24.981 --> 00:10:26.160
<v Speaker 6>If an opportunity presents a take,</v>
<v Speaker 6>take,</v>

260
00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:28.110
<v Speaker 6>take,</v>
<v Speaker 6>take control of it or not.</v>

261
00:10:28.111 --> 00:10:33.111
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean like that's what the whole idea </v>

262
00:10:33.111 --> 00:10:33.111
<v Speaker 6>of martial arts is about.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not that you're going to be able to</v>

263
00:10:33.111 --> 00:10:33.150
<v Speaker 6>beat people up or you're gonna be able </v>
<v Speaker 6>to fight.</v>

264
00:10:33.151 --> 00:10:35.340
<v Speaker 6>It's like at least you're gonna know </v>
<v Speaker 6>what's happening.</v>

265
00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:39.270
<v Speaker 6>It was like the scariest thing about any</v>
<v Speaker 6>sort of an altercation is when you don't</v>

266
00:10:39.271 --> 00:10:40.620
<v Speaker 6>know how to defend yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You don't know what to do.</v>

267
00:10:40.621 --> 00:10:45.621
<v Speaker 6>And I've seen guys,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I saw this guy got knocked the fuck out </v>

268
00:10:45.621 --> 00:10:45.621
<v Speaker 6>once and it was crazy.</v>

269
00:10:45.621 --> 00:10:50.150
<v Speaker 6>You're talking about like at a bar.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was a bar and they got into a fight </v>

270
00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:52.300
<v Speaker 6>and as they got into a fight,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one guy was just that.</v>

271
00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:56.850
<v Speaker 6>He just went into a full panic and was </v>
<v Speaker 6>just swinging his hands.</v>

272
00:10:56.970 --> 00:10:59.250
<v Speaker 6>He wasn't even making girls.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yes,</v>

273
00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:04.280
<v Speaker 6>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Full Papo swing his hands and a car got </v>

274
00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:07.360
<v Speaker 6>in front of me and as the car gun free </v>
<v Speaker 6>because people were trying to get out of</v>

275
00:11:07.361 --> 00:11:12.361
<v Speaker 6>this parking lot while this fight was </v>
<v Speaker 6>going on and as the car got in front of </v>

276
00:11:12.361 --> 00:11:12.361
<v Speaker 6>me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>as the car passed,</v>

277
00:11:12.361 --> 00:11:12.660
<v Speaker 6>he was out cold on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

278
00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:17.840
<v Speaker 6>flattened out first,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it was a look in his eyes have </v>

279
00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:20.010
<v Speaker 6>complete total panic.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He had no idea what to do.</v>

280
00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:23.040
<v Speaker 6>He was locked into this situation.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was on sunset.</v>

281
00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:23.820
<v Speaker 7>You understand?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

282
00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:27.090
<v Speaker 7>you doing what you do with mma and </v>
<v Speaker 7>everything and being involved in the,</v>

283
00:11:27.091 --> 00:11:28.740
<v Speaker 7>in the scene.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like when I went to the,</v>

284
00:11:28.741 --> 00:11:31.170
<v Speaker 7>I went to my first mma fight,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we saw the one in Charlotte,</v>

285
00:11:31.171 --> 00:11:33.210
<v Speaker 7>right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Sit there and watching UFC and I'm like,</v>

286
00:11:33.211 --> 00:11:38.211
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've seen it on at bars and I'm like </v>

287
00:11:38.211 --> 00:11:38.211
<v Speaker 7>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this is cool.</v>

288
00:11:38.211 --> 00:11:38.211
<v Speaker 7>And seeing it in person,</v>
<v Speaker 7>getting a huge amount of respect for the</v>

289
00:11:38.211 --> 00:11:39.510
<v Speaker 7>fighters and how tremendous athletes </v>
<v Speaker 7>these guys are.</v>

290
00:11:39.511 --> 00:11:40.520
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>But whatever,</v>

291
00:11:40.521 --> 00:11:41.070
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

292
00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:44.040
<v Speaker 7>living in Raleigh and seeing bar fights </v>
<v Speaker 7>which breakout in a regular basis,</v>

293
00:11:44.041 --> 00:11:47.120
<v Speaker 7>they're not as bad as Boston by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We need to talk about Boston dude.</v>

294
00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:52.840
<v Speaker 6>That's the land of savages.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Twelve 30 hits and it's the witching </v>

295
00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:55.981
<v Speaker 6>hour is too many ugly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Angry women do their pissed to cf </v>

296
00:11:55.981 --> 00:11:56.290
<v Speaker 6>summit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But we'll get there.</v>

297
00:11:56.291 --> 00:12:01.291
<v Speaker 6>We'll get there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But like whenever I see a fight for </v>

298
00:12:01.291 --> 00:12:01.291
<v Speaker 6>life,</v>
<v Speaker 6>dude,</v>

299
00:12:01.291 --> 00:12:03.771
<v Speaker 6>if it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>unless it's two guys who were scrappers </v>

300
00:12:03.771 --> 00:12:03.771
<v Speaker 6>Mandy see like one guy picks a fight </v>
<v Speaker 6>with the sky,</v>

301
00:12:03.771 --> 00:12:05.380
<v Speaker 6>just nobody's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it's really ugly shit man.</v>

302
00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:10.410
<v Speaker 6>When you see somebody actually </v>
<v Speaker 6>legitimately get hit and beaten up like </v>

303
00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:10.410
<v Speaker 6>that before the staff and get to them,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's pretty fucked up.</v>

304
00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:12.070
<v Speaker 6>When someone knows how to fight in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>other person doesn't.</v>

305
00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:17.130
<v Speaker 6>I try to make friends with the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 6>motherfuckers and tenants could hide </v>

306
00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:17.410
<v Speaker 6>behind people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Notice,</v>

307
00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:22.440
<v Speaker 6>notice when the shit's about to hit the </v>
<v Speaker 6>fan and know where the door is all </v>

308
00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:22.440
<v Speaker 6>important.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can smell it,</v>

309
00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:22.990
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

310
00:12:22.991 --> 00:12:25.540
<v Speaker 6>And they think about someone who does </v>
<v Speaker 6>train in martial arts.</v>

311
00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:29.150
<v Speaker 6>Most of the time you don't want to fight</v>
<v Speaker 6>because it's not the same thing anymore.</v>

312
00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:31.030
<v Speaker 6>A good bouncer.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know how to diffuse the situation,</v>

313
00:12:31.031 --> 00:12:31.920
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're not looking at cracks.</v>

314
00:12:31.921 --> 00:12:33.070
<v Speaker 6>Skulls.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not just that.</v>

315
00:12:33.071 --> 00:12:35.080
<v Speaker 6>It's like you kinda.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not attractive.</v>

316
00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:40.110
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>for some guys the idea of beating </v>

317
00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:41.641
<v Speaker 6>someone's asked is like attractive.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But when you do martial arts all the </v>

318
00:12:41.641 --> 00:12:41.641
<v Speaker 6>time,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's not attractive at all.</v>

319
00:12:41.641 --> 00:12:42.310
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't seem like a thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It seems like,</v>

320
00:12:42.311 --> 00:12:43.690
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what you want to do is avoid all that.</v>

321
00:12:43.691 --> 00:12:44.830
<v Speaker 6>This is a stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This can get.</v>

322
00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:49.860
<v Speaker 6>You can get hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like you don't have any need to prove </v>

323
00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:51.430
<v Speaker 6>yourself physically were a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 6>do and unfortunately sometimes they just</v>

324
00:12:51.431 --> 00:12:52.860
<v Speaker 6>trying to bluff,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

325
00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:54.940
<v Speaker 6>and they get called out on it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They don't know what to do.</v>

326
00:12:54.941 --> 00:12:59.941
<v Speaker 6>They're already at step nine.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They don't know how that got there </v>

327
00:12:59.941 --> 00:12:59.941
<v Speaker 6>because they're in Toronto.</v>

328
00:12:59.941 --> 00:12:59.941
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then you know,</v>

329
00:12:59.941 --> 00:13:04.201
<v Speaker 6>and then they say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well I to hear this guy and they go to </v>

330
00:13:04.201 --> 00:13:06.991
<v Speaker 6>take a swing in the horror upon horrors </v>
<v Speaker 6>is when you throw a punch at a guy and </v>

331
00:13:06.991 --> 00:13:11.080
<v Speaker 6>he moves,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he actually knows how to fight and he's </v>

332
00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:13.301
<v Speaker 6>sober.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then you're fucked because then you're </v>

333
00:13:13.301 --> 00:13:13.301
<v Speaker 6>drunk and you did a Douche bag thing and</v>
<v Speaker 6>some guys going to let you up.</v>

334
00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:18.620
<v Speaker 6>Next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're on the side of the street </v>

335
00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:18.620
<v Speaker 6>bleeding.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're bleeding.</v>

336
00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:21.001
<v Speaker 6>Or from my experience,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean there's always going to be </v>

337
00:13:21.001 --> 00:13:21.001
<v Speaker 6>assholes that do martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like just assholes to do everything,</v>

338
00:13:21.001 --> 00:13:22.420
<v Speaker 6>but it's much,</v>
<v Speaker 6>much smaller.</v>

339
00:13:22.421 --> 00:13:27.421
<v Speaker 6>Number,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so the odds of someone who wants to </v>

340
00:13:27.421 --> 00:13:27.640
<v Speaker 6>fight actually being a martial artist,</v>
<v Speaker 6>most of the time they're not.</v>

341
00:13:27.641 --> 00:13:32.641
<v Speaker 6>It's a big misconception like these guys</v>
<v Speaker 6>that are filing George Saint Pierre </v>

342
00:13:32.641 --> 00:13:35.581
<v Speaker 6>who's like one of the nicest guy you're </v>
<v Speaker 6>ever going to meet and even Josh </v>

343
00:13:35.581 --> 00:13:35.770
<v Speaker 6>Koscheck,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the guy who's fighting him this weekend,</v>

344
00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:37.180
<v Speaker 6>fucking great guy.</v>

345
00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:42.210
<v Speaker 6>If you're not fighting him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean he likes to talk a lot of shit </v>

346
00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:43.160
<v Speaker 6>and likes to like get inside guys heads,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but a lot of that's pre-fight high.</v>

347
00:13:43.161 --> 00:13:45.520
<v Speaker 6>But outside of that he's a very nice.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A lot of those guys beat the shit out of</v>

348
00:13:45.521 --> 00:13:47.170
<v Speaker 6>each other and then they just the end,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're just kinda like,</v>

349
00:13:47.171 --> 00:13:52.171
<v Speaker 6>what's.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because it's a mutually kind of assumed </v>

350
00:13:52.171 --> 00:13:52.171
<v Speaker 6>destruction,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

351
00:13:52.171 --> 00:13:52.171
<v Speaker 6>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

352
00:13:52.171 --> 00:13:52.171
<v Speaker 6>I'm going into this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's my profession,</v>

353
00:13:52.171 --> 00:13:52.300
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's that.</v>

354
00:13:52.301 --> 00:13:56.020
<v Speaker 6>And some guys get real caught up in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>shit talking and some guys,</v>

355
00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:58.780
<v Speaker 6>some guys,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they drop it as soon as the fight's over</v>

356
00:13:58.781 --> 00:13:59.530
<v Speaker 6>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you see them,</v>

357
00:13:59.531 --> 00:14:01.210
<v Speaker 6>they'll go out and have beers and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

358
00:14:01.211 --> 00:14:01.720
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>

359
00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:04.630
<v Speaker 6>there's a certain amount of stress </v>
<v Speaker 6>involved in this person's your target.</v>

360
00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:06.760
<v Speaker 6>You're going to be some animosity,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

361
00:14:06.761 --> 00:14:11.761
<v Speaker 6>but for the most part they'd like </v>
<v Speaker 6>resolve it way better than boxers do </v>

362
00:14:11.761 --> 00:14:11.761
<v Speaker 6>know.</v>

363
00:14:11.761 --> 00:14:13.600
<v Speaker 6>Boxers seem to be on,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know what it is,</v>

364
00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:16.030
<v Speaker 6>but there's like more douchebags in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>boxing community.</v>

365
00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:19.180
<v Speaker 6>I'm not exactly sure what that was like </v>
<v Speaker 6>five,</v>

366
00:14:19.181 --> 00:14:24.181
<v Speaker 6>eight years ago and it was considered </v>
<v Speaker 6>that nice thing and that that's always </v>

367
00:14:24.181 --> 00:14:24.181
<v Speaker 6>the way with any sort of any sport,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

368
00:14:24.181 --> 00:14:28.411
<v Speaker 6>Looking snowboarding.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that was all the skiers looked down </v>

369
00:14:28.411 --> 00:14:28.411
<v Speaker 6>on,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like that's a joke.</v>

370
00:14:28.411 --> 00:14:29.080
<v Speaker 6>That's never going to be big a doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Snowboarding's Frickin huge.</v>

371
00:14:29.081 --> 00:14:34.081
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>That happens with so many different </v>

372
00:14:34.081 --> 00:14:34.081
<v Speaker 6>sports.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

373
00:14:34.081 --> 00:14:35.080
<v Speaker 6>When I was first involved in mma,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was almost like telling people that I</v>

374
00:14:35.081 --> 00:14:37.610
<v Speaker 6>was involved in porn,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

375
00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:39.670
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because I was working on Newsradio.</v>

376
00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:40.620
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>

377
00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:41.950
<v Speaker 6>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not the only one who said this.</v>

378
00:14:41.951 --> 00:14:44.390
<v Speaker 6>Dana White said the exact same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He said the exact,</v>

379
00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:49.580
<v Speaker 6>the exact same feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You feel like you're doing something </v>

380
00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:49.580
<v Speaker 6>sleazy.</v>

381
00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:49.580
<v Speaker 6>I say video games,</v>
<v Speaker 6>dude.</v>

382
00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:49.940
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

383
00:14:49.941 --> 00:14:50.620
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Dude.</v>

384
00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:51.380
<v Speaker 6>When I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

385
00:14:51.381 --> 00:14:56.381
<v Speaker 6>this is my story.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was on news radio and I started doing </v>

386
00:14:56.381 --> 00:14:57.530
<v Speaker 6>the backstage university UFC and this </v>
<v Speaker 6>was 1997,</v>

387
00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:02.800
<v Speaker 6>so this is like we were in Augusta,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Georgia and dove in Alabama and places </v>

388
00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:06.941
<v Speaker 6>like that and I would tell them that I </v>
<v Speaker 6>was off to go do commentary for cage </v>

389
00:15:06.941 --> 00:15:07.560
<v Speaker 6>fighter and they would look at me like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck is wrong with you?</v>

390
00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:09.770
<v Speaker 6>This is terrible for your career.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You want,</v>

391
00:15:09.771 --> 00:15:12.920
<v Speaker 6>you want people to know that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're commentating on cage fighting.</v>

392
00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:13.800
<v Speaker 6>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

393
00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:15.680
<v Speaker 6>it was almost like I was doing girls </v>
<v Speaker 6>gone wild or something.</v>

394
00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:18.390
<v Speaker 7>The video game analogy though,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean it's not a one to one,</v>

395
00:15:18.391 --> 00:15:20.150
<v Speaker 7>but at the same time it was one of the </v>
<v Speaker 7>situations like,</v>

396
00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:20.970
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>10,</v>

397
00:15:20.971 --> 00:15:22.380
<v Speaker 7>15 years ago was like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you want to do that?</v>

398
00:15:22.381 --> 00:15:22.800
<v Speaker 7>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

399
00:15:22.801 --> 00:15:23.620
<v Speaker 7>that's cute.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

400
00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:28.690
<v Speaker 7>my,</v>
<v Speaker 7>my little son plays that in the </v>

401
00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:28.690
<v Speaker 7>basement.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

402
00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:28.690
<v Speaker 7>And now it's one of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You look at everything from the three 60</v>

403
00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:30.590
<v Speaker 7>that we to Natal and Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I see what you're saying,</v>

404
00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:32.400
<v Speaker 7>but it doesn't have a negative </v>
<v Speaker 7>connotation.</v>

405
00:15:32.401 --> 00:15:35.420
<v Speaker 7>Does it not ever used to.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now it's the coolest fucking drop and it</v>

406
00:15:35.421 --> 00:15:35.940
<v Speaker 7>was,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it used to,</v>

407
00:15:35.941 --> 00:15:38.340
<v Speaker 7>it was more of a frivolous connotation,</v>
<v Speaker 7>not a negative,</v>

408
00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:40.890
<v Speaker 7>it wasn't negative,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it was more of a pat submissive.</v>

409
00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:45.960
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You run along little billy with your </v>

410
00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:45.960
<v Speaker 7>little video games thing because he used</v>
<v Speaker 7>to play pong.</v>

411
00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:45.960
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

412
00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:50.150
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But now there's games like call of duty </v>

413
00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:50.150
<v Speaker 6>that make more money,</v>
<v Speaker 6>way more than Avatar and that like,</v>

414
00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:50.810
<v Speaker 6>that needs to sink into people's.</v>

415
00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:53.690
<v Speaker 7>Had they go to the difference of $6 day </v>
<v Speaker 7>one versus,</v>

416
00:15:53.691 --> 00:15:54.410
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>10 bucks,</v>

417
00:15:54.411 --> 00:15:55.760
<v Speaker 7>right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Immediately takes,</v>

418
00:15:55.761 --> 00:15:56.990
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>not as many people to do it.</v>

419
00:15:56.991 --> 00:16:01.991
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean they are getting so good at </v>

420
00:16:01.991 --> 00:16:01.991
<v Speaker 7>building up the hype for these midnight </v>
<v Speaker 7>launches for all of this.</v>

421
00:16:01.991 --> 00:16:01.991
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like,</v>

422
00:16:01.991 --> 00:16:06.570
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the biggest issue right now is how much </v>

423
00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:06.570
<v Speaker 7>of that money you think the actual </v>
<v Speaker 7>developers are saying?</v>

424
00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:10.070
<v Speaker 7>I don't know necessarily a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's a lot of controversy about call </v>

425
00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:13.031
<v Speaker 7>of duty.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know if you heard the whole </v>

426
00:16:13.031 --> 00:16:13.031
<v Speaker 7>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 7>please tell him is.</v>

427
00:16:13.031 --> 00:16:13.280
<v Speaker 7>So basically the call of duty guys </v>
<v Speaker 7>originally were uh,</v>

428
00:16:13.281 --> 00:16:14.240
<v Speaker 7>these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

429
00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:17.360
<v Speaker 7>from infinity ward and Jason and fence.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Real good guys.</v>

430
00:16:17.361 --> 00:16:18.380
<v Speaker 7>And they,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

431
00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:23.440
<v Speaker 7>had originally built this brand after </v>
<v Speaker 7>working on metal of honor because they </v>

432
00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:24.490
<v Speaker 7>built up metal of honor and then that </v>
<v Speaker 7>didn't work out for a number of reasons.</v>

433
00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:26.900
<v Speaker 7>You can look all this up.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They built the call of duty brand up and</v>

434
00:16:26.901 --> 00:16:30.260
<v Speaker 7>then basically a modern warfare hit,</v>
<v Speaker 7>made a ton of money.</v>

435
00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:32.600
<v Speaker 7>They basically didn't see much of it and</v>
<v Speaker 7>then they were like,</v>

436
00:16:32.601 --> 00:16:33.800
<v Speaker 7>screw you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we're going to go do our own thing.</v>

437
00:16:33.801 --> 00:16:38.801
<v Speaker 7>It's a very controversial thing with a </v>
<v Speaker 7>lot of lawsuits and everything like </v>

438
00:16:38.801 --> 00:16:38.801
<v Speaker 7>that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

439
00:16:38.801 --> 00:16:42.130
<v Speaker 7>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I stayed on the site generally that the </v>

440
00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:42.130
<v Speaker 7>developers,</v>
<v Speaker 7>because I believe in developers,</v>

441
00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:45.161
<v Speaker 7>riots,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I believe paying people what they're </v>

442
00:16:45.161 --> 00:16:46.421
<v Speaker 7>worth.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And when you create a multimillion </v>

443
00:16:46.421 --> 00:16:46.421
<v Speaker 7>dollar to potentially billion dollar </v>
<v Speaker 7>brand,</v>

444
00:16:46.421 --> 00:16:46.421
<v Speaker 7>you deserve to be paid for it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

445
00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:49.670
<v Speaker 6>So the issue is that the people that </v>
<v Speaker 6>finance it or getting the majority of</v>

446
00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:52.250
<v Speaker 7>about the large studio,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

447
00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:54.480
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>activision basically,</v>

448
00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:56.760
<v Speaker 7>from what I can tell again,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this is secondhand knowledge.</v>

449
00:16:56.761 --> 00:17:01.761
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the guys basically did not feel that </v>

450
00:17:01.761 --> 00:17:02.340
<v Speaker 7>they were paid what we're worth for </v>
<v Speaker 7>because when they have contracts,</v>

451
00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:05.460
<v Speaker 7>once your studio is purchased and you're</v>
<v Speaker 7>part of a larger conglomerate,</v>

452
00:17:05.461 --> 00:17:07.780
<v Speaker 7>your game can make a billion dollars and</v>
<v Speaker 7>they could just give your studio,</v>

453
00:17:07.781 --> 00:17:08.700
<v Speaker 7>have half a million,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it'd be like,</v>

454
00:17:08.701 --> 00:17:09.450
<v Speaker 7>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we own you,</v>

455
00:17:09.451 --> 00:17:10.470
<v Speaker 7>like whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>

456
00:17:10.471 --> 00:17:12.210
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and I don't know what the numbers are,</v>

457
00:17:12.211 --> 00:17:14.820
<v Speaker 7>but you're increasingly seeing in the </v>
<v Speaker 7>video game industry,</v>

458
00:17:14.830 --> 00:17:17.820
<v Speaker 7>people getting a lot of representation,</v>
<v Speaker 7>people getting a agents,</v>

459
00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:20.610
<v Speaker 7>they're people you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>getting a proper accountants and lawyers</v>

460
00:17:20.611 --> 00:17:22.230
<v Speaker 7>and they're actually negotiating this </v>
<v Speaker 7>sort of thing.</v>

461
00:17:22.231 --> 00:17:23.310
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

462
00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:25.770
<v Speaker 7>people like Warren Spector,</v>
<v Speaker 7>her created Datastax,</v>

463
00:17:25.771 --> 00:17:27.810
<v Speaker 7>people like Ken Levine who created </v>
<v Speaker 7>bioshock.</v>

464
00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:30.450
<v Speaker 7>They've got deals now.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They're making amazing games and they're</v>

465
00:17:30.451 --> 00:17:32.580
<v Speaker 7>going to make sure that they and their </v>
<v Speaker 7>staff are taking good care of.</v>

466
00:17:32.581 --> 00:17:32.820
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

467
00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:36.110

<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

468
00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:41.180
<v Speaker 6>John Ramirez,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was broke off from id software and </v>

469
00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:44.451
<v Speaker 6>that was like the first drama in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>game community that this Guy John </v>

470
00:17:44.451 --> 00:17:45.540
<v Speaker 6>Romero,</v>
<v Speaker 6>who's the game designer splits from this</v>

471
00:17:45.541 --> 00:17:50.541
<v Speaker 6>Guy John Carmack,</v>
<v Speaker 6>who's this fucking super from another </v>

472
00:17:50.541 --> 00:17:50.541
<v Speaker 6>planet</v>

473
00:17:50.541 --> 00:17:51.300
<v Speaker 4>wizard guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

474
00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:53.640
<v Speaker 4>He's the one of very few dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I'm around them,</v>

475
00:17:53.641 --> 00:17:55.020
<v Speaker 4>I get intimidated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

476
00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:56.820
<v Speaker 4>Like when I'm talking to John Carmack,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

477
00:17:56.821 --> 00:18:00.180
<v Speaker 4>why am I even talking about talking to </v>
<v Speaker 4>this guy?</v>

478
00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:01.890
<v Speaker 4>Did you ever fucking alien?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

479
00:18:01.891 --> 00:18:05.490
<v Speaker 4>Same sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This whole lake one in a billion type of</v>

480
00:18:05.491 --> 00:18:08.340
<v Speaker 4>personality genius alien do right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it's amazing.</v>

481
00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:13.520
<v Speaker 4>I thought another level than all of us </v>
<v Speaker 4>and carmax would sit in front of the </v>

482
00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:13.520
<v Speaker 4>computer for people who don't know who </v>
<v Speaker 4>he is,</v>

483
00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:17.870
<v Speaker 4>16 hours a day code and then he would go</v>
<v Speaker 4>make rocket scientist in his spare time.</v>

484
00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:25.840
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was involved with the x prize and I </v>

485
00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:25.840
<v Speaker 4>was like trying to win the x prize.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's his hobby.</v>

486
00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:27.500
<v Speaker 4>And when he wasn't doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was turbo charging Ferrari's,</v>

487
00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:29.580
<v Speaker 4>building turbo charges for Ferrari.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a big no,</v>

488
00:18:29.581 --> 00:18:30.380
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>

489
00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:31.570
<v Speaker 4>right there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if it's like,</v>

490
00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:33.720
<v Speaker 4>it's like buying a Mona Lisa and just </v>
<v Speaker 4>painting over it,</v>

491
00:18:33.721 --> 00:18:34.000
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

492
00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:39.180
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he just doesn't have no reverence </v>

493
00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:39.180
<v Speaker 4>for any objects.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

494
00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:42.021
<v Speaker 4>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it has an alien with the rumor was </v>

495
00:18:42.021 --> 00:18:42.990
<v Speaker 4>that like after he started doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that Ferrari kind of was like,</v>

496
00:18:42.991 --> 00:18:43.410
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are you?</v>

497
00:18:43.411 --> 00:18:48.411
<v Speaker 4>Come on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like we're undermining all of our </v>

498
00:18:48.411 --> 00:18:48.411
<v Speaker 4>engineers here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>

499
00:18:48.411 --> 00:18:48.670
<v Speaker 4>our,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he still fucking with that shit.</v>

500
00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:53.880
<v Speaker 4>He was making like these 12,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>horsepower Ferrari's fucking nuclear </v>

501
00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:54.730
<v Speaker 4>energy die.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

502
00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:59.780
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well he apparently was really nutty </v>

503
00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:02.020
<v Speaker 4>thrill seeker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He used to really like to go really </v>

504
00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:02.020
<v Speaker 4>fast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is.</v>

505
00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:04.571
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What happened was we cannot expect he </v>

506
00:19:04.571 --> 00:19:04.571
<v Speaker 4>left id software.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The guys that do do this.</v>

507
00:19:04.571 --> 00:19:04.571
<v Speaker 4>John Romero guy to get back to this </v>
<v Speaker 4>story.</v>

508
00:19:04.571 --> 00:19:09.490
<v Speaker 4>This guy was like the playboy character.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like rock docstar and you know,</v>

509
00:19:10.381 --> 00:19:15.381
<v Speaker 4>and then they left.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what was that crazy game that they </v>

510
00:19:15.381 --> 00:19:17.841
<v Speaker 4>came out with afterwards when they did </v>
<v Speaker 4>an acronym and diatonic diatonic that </v>

511
00:19:17.841 --> 00:19:17.841
<v Speaker 4>was the one.</v>

512
00:19:17.841 --> 00:19:19.580
<v Speaker 4>So they.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he leaves and you know,</v>

513
00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:21.720
<v Speaker 4>it was like sort of a cult of </v>
<v Speaker 4>personality thing.</v>

514
00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:22.830
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was.</v>

515
00:19:22.831 --> 00:19:25.740
<v Speaker 4>The big debate was who was the most </v>
<v Speaker 4>important,</v>

516
00:19:25.741 --> 00:19:30.741
<v Speaker 4>is that the game designers have a guy </v>
<v Speaker 4>with the vision or is it the coder and </v>

517
00:19:30.741 --> 00:19:31.020
<v Speaker 4>how easy it is to actually design the </v>
<v Speaker 4>games.</v>

518
00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:36.320
<v Speaker 4>The game designers often the chaos and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the programmer or producers usually the </v>

519
00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:36.320
<v Speaker 4>order,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

520
00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:38.730
<v Speaker 4>It's a combination of those two persons </v>
<v Speaker 4>saying what's the best part of the band?</v>

521
00:19:38.731 --> 00:19:43.731
<v Speaker 4>Is it the singers and the drummers get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you get the singer who could be on </v>

522
00:19:43.731 --> 00:19:43.731
<v Speaker 4>stage and be charismatic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

523
00:19:43.731 --> 00:19:45.090
<v Speaker 4>you get David Lee Roth but you don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>have Eddie van Halen backing them up.</v>

524
00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:46.560
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't have the magic.</v>

525
00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:48.480
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the example,</v>

526
00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:52.560
<v Speaker 4>he wasn't in Van Halen on his own,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on his own.</v>

527
00:19:52.561 --> 00:19:53.960
<v Speaker 4>It was just David Lee Roth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's gone,</v>

528
00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:55.770
<v Speaker 4>he's doing some cool stuff now.</v>

529
00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:56.730
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's great.</v>

530
00:19:56.731 --> 00:19:57.900
<v Speaker 4>He's a great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've met him.</v>

531
00:19:57.901 --> 00:20:00.030
<v Speaker 4>I met him at the comedy store,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was one of the fucking coolest celebrity</v>

532
00:20:00.031 --> 00:20:02.140
<v Speaker 4>meetings I've ever had ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But my point was that,</v>

533
00:20:02.141 --> 00:20:03.660
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a group,</v>

534
00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:08.840
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those guys created some pretty fucking </v>

535
00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:08.840
<v Speaker 4>dope games,</v>
<v Speaker 4>doom,</v>

536
00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:09.150
<v Speaker 4>doom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they created as a group.</v>

537
00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:11.060
<v Speaker 4>And the idea was that it was all this </v>
<v Speaker 4>guys.</v>

538
00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:14.130
<v Speaker 4>So this guy leaves and he gets this </v>
<v Speaker 4>giant fucking deal.</v>

539
00:20:14.131 --> 00:20:16.680
<v Speaker 4>Is John Romero,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did you visit the Dallas Office?</v>

540
00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:18.030
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I heard it was insane.</v>

541
00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:21.870
<v Speaker 4>It was like the top floor with a </v>
<v Speaker 4>unbelievable views.</v>

542
00:20:21.871 --> 00:20:24.540
<v Speaker 4>Just stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy overhead.</v>

543
00:20:24.541 --> 00:20:29.541
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is legendary gaming history you're </v>

544
00:20:29.541 --> 00:20:29.541
<v Speaker 4>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

545
00:20:29.541 --> 00:20:32.241
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well this is how much of a Dork I am </v>

546
00:20:32.241 --> 00:20:32.241
<v Speaker 4>about this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

547
00:20:32.241 --> 00:20:32.241
<v Speaker 4>he uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he gets crazy,</v>

548
00:20:32.241 --> 00:20:35.970
<v Speaker 4>crazy money and then to just lazy as </v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck and they just barely working,</v>

549
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:36.360
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

550
00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:39.240
<v Speaker 4>This game like takes forever to come </v>
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>

551
00:20:39.241 --> 00:20:42.030
<v Speaker 4>It comes out all wonky and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you walk through walls.</v>

552
00:20:42.031 --> 00:20:43.700
<v Speaker 4>That's an abbreviated version man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I mean,</v>

553
00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:44.490
<v Speaker 4>the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is he,</v>

554
00:20:44.491 --> 00:20:48.460
<v Speaker 4>he assembled a team so fucking fast and </v>
<v Speaker 4>try to be so ambitious so quick.</v>

555
00:20:48.461 --> 00:20:53.461
<v Speaker 4>And that was with [inaudible] money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is basically the Lara Croft tomb </v>

556
00:20:53.461 --> 00:20:53.461
<v Speaker 4>raider paying for this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

557
00:20:53.461 --> 00:20:54.880
<v Speaker 4>And so once you build a team that </v>
<v Speaker 4>quickly,</v>

558
00:20:54.881 --> 00:20:56.740
<v Speaker 4>like you can't just overnight assemble a</v>
<v Speaker 4>bunch of people,</v>

559
00:20:56.741 --> 00:20:58.570
<v Speaker 4>I can Hollywood and have magic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

560
00:20:58.571 --> 00:20:59.920
<v Speaker 4>And so half,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not half,</v>

561
00:20:59.921 --> 00:21:01.270
<v Speaker 4>but a good percentage of the guys I work</v>
<v Speaker 4>with,</v>

562
00:21:01.271 --> 00:21:03.790
<v Speaker 4>my fucking art director,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's this amazingly talented,</v>

563
00:21:03.791 --> 00:21:06.260
<v Speaker 4>awesome guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bled out of the eyeballs to ship.</v>

564
00:21:06.261 --> 00:21:11.261
<v Speaker 4>I katata he went to work for mirror </v>
<v Speaker 4>because he thought Ramiro was a cool </v>

565
00:21:11.261 --> 00:21:14.401
<v Speaker 4>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he still tells me stories about </v>

566
00:21:14.401 --> 00:21:15.060
<v Speaker 4>having panic attacks in Dallas and how </v>
<v Speaker 4>he almost killed himself to Christ.</v>

567
00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:18.430
<v Speaker 4>And so like I always look at that and </v>
<v Speaker 4>realize how much you guys work dude.</v>

568
00:21:18.431 --> 00:21:20.080
<v Speaker 4>It's like if you look around the room,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

569
00:21:20.081 --> 00:21:25.081
<v Speaker 4>Every little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody has to work and build every </v>

570
00:21:25.081 --> 00:21:25.630
<v Speaker 4>last little bit of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When we visited you and you were talking</v>

571
00:21:25.631 --> 00:21:30.631
<v Speaker 4>about when crunch time comes into,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like right at the end and </v>

572
00:21:30.631 --> 00:21:30.970
<v Speaker 4>everybody's like basically sleeping at </v>
<v Speaker 4>the office.</v>

573
00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:33.190
<v Speaker 4>That's all you do is you work with all </v>
<v Speaker 4>dense.</v>

574
00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:38.260
<v Speaker 4>Gotten better than that with like we've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we figured out how to make games better </v>

575
00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:41.161
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you get a producer who knows his </v>

576
00:21:41.161 --> 00:21:41.161
<v Speaker 4>shit and it's kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

577
00:21:41.161 --> 00:21:41.161
<v Speaker 4>we're not just gonna all work really </v>
<v Speaker 4>hard to hope it turns out great.</v>

578
00:21:41.161 --> 00:21:42.280
<v Speaker 4>We're going to actually have a plan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

579
00:21:42.281 --> 00:21:47.281
<v Speaker 4>So if you say when it's done,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that doesn't mean you really know what </v>

580
00:21:47.281 --> 00:21:47.281
<v Speaker 4>game you're building.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At the same time,</v>

581
00:21:47.281 --> 00:21:48.130
<v Speaker 4>you need to have a little bit of wiggle </v>
<v Speaker 4>room because it's not.</v>

582
00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:50.920
<v Speaker 4>It's not a like a a definable process.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're,</v>

583
00:21:50.921 --> 00:21:52.060
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're panning for gold,</v>

584
00:21:52.061 --> 00:21:52.810
<v Speaker 4>you're trying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's comedy.</v>

585
00:21:52.811 --> 00:21:53.950
<v Speaker 4>I like comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You iterate,</v>

586
00:21:53.951 --> 00:21:55.930
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so comprehensive though.</v>

587
00:21:55.931 --> 00:22:00.931
<v Speaker 4>I mean people don't understand what goes</v>
<v Speaker 4>into making a game that just the amount </v>

588
00:22:00.931 --> 00:22:04.531
<v Speaker 4>of effort.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember we were exhausted leaving </v>

589
00:22:04.531 --> 00:22:04.570
<v Speaker 4>thinking about the hours that you guys </v>
<v Speaker 4>work,</v>

590
00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:06.640
<v Speaker 4>but remember we were talking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but dude,</v>

591
00:22:06.641 --> 00:22:08.170
<v Speaker 4>you can't burn through people that much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

592
00:22:08.171 --> 00:22:09.820
<v Speaker 4>You could maybe get away with a few </v>
<v Speaker 4>crunches like that.</v>

593
00:22:09.821 --> 00:22:12.250
<v Speaker 4>So we're the point where it will do </v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe 10 hours a day,</v>

594
00:22:12.251 --> 00:22:14.350
<v Speaker 4>12 tops,</v>
<v Speaker 4>five days a week tops,</v>

595
00:22:14.351 --> 00:22:14.870
<v Speaker 4>and then we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

596
00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:15.730
<v Speaker 4>we call it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're like,</v>

597
00:22:15.731 --> 00:22:17.560
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if we just say it's not worth it,</v>

598
00:22:17.610 --> 00:22:18.340
<v Speaker 4>be smart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

599
00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:21.390
<v Speaker 4>because we're over 40 dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

600
00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:22.720
<v Speaker 4>They just got fried,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

601
00:22:22.721 --> 00:22:24.160
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

602
00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:29.250
<v Speaker 4>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you about that dike atonic </v>

603
00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:29.250
<v Speaker 4>thing though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even though it was like a long time.</v>

604
00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:29.410
<v Speaker 4>It was a fun game to play.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>

605
00:22:29.411 --> 00:22:32.830
<v Speaker 4>Deathmatch deathmatch was fun on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They had some cool to cool rocket,</v>

606
00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:37.060
<v Speaker 4>crazy weird rocket launcher.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They haven't had a shotgun that had like</v>

607
00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:39.430
<v Speaker 4>18 barrels or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was.</v>

608
00:22:39.431 --> 00:22:40.810
<v Speaker 4>They had some cool shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

609
00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:44.410
<v Speaker 4>Romero was like supposedly like he was </v>
<v Speaker 4>into first person shooters and death.</v>

610
00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:45.550
<v Speaker 4>Magical.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was him.</v>

611
00:22:45.551 --> 00:22:48.550
<v Speaker 4>It was him in Carmel and that whole crew</v>
<v Speaker 4>that just birthed the genre.</v>

612
00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:51.490
<v Speaker 4>It's one of the lessons I tell the guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you have a new camera angle,</v>

613
00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:56.670
<v Speaker 4>you can create a whole new genre.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The first quake was a fucking </v>

614
00:22:56.670 --> 00:22:58.000
<v Speaker 4>masterpiece for like death match.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brian says you're still hung up on it.</v>

615
00:22:58.030 --> 00:23:00.160
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well I'm still hung up on all games,</v>

616
00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:03.160
<v Speaker 4>but not really quick to quick to never </v>
<v Speaker 4>really got me.</v>

617
00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:08.340
<v Speaker 4>But quake one dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The only thing that got me about quick </v>

618
00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:08.340
<v Speaker 4>too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as the rail gun,</v>

619
00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:08.340
<v Speaker 4>that was very key because when.</v>

620
00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:09.410
<v Speaker 4>That's when accuracy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it became very.</v>

621
00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:12.190
<v Speaker 4>You know what your problem,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fact that with quake two to actually</v>

622
00:23:12.191 --> 00:23:13.900
<v Speaker 4>balanced the weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

623
00:23:13.901 --> 00:23:16.000
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just didn't like the way it felt.</v>

624
00:23:16.150 --> 00:23:18.310
<v Speaker 4>It just didn't feel as good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't as fast paced.</v>

625
00:23:18.311 --> 00:23:20.170
<v Speaker 4>It was a little slower.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas quake one,</v>

626
00:23:20.171 --> 00:23:23.340
<v Speaker 4>you can move much quicker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was much more like chaotic place.</v>

627
00:23:23.341 --> 00:23:28.341
<v Speaker 4>The numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it has to be point seven seconds or </v>

628
00:23:28.341 --> 00:23:31.440
<v Speaker 4>less.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What it is is that I just really love </v>

629
00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:31.540
<v Speaker 4>death match.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I really love.</v>

630
00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:33.670
<v Speaker 4>That's all I played in college.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A team death match.</v>

631
00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:35.980
<v Speaker 4>Like anytime it comes up with any sort </v>
<v Speaker 4>of domination and CTF,</v>

632
00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:41.040
<v Speaker 4>might I just want to shoot people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do you feel about those things that </v>

633
00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:42.130
<v Speaker 4>hook up to a console and give you a </v>
<v Speaker 4>mouse and a keyboard of those good.</v>

634
00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:44.050
<v Speaker 4>I mean they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're cool and all.</v>

635
00:23:44.051 --> 00:23:45.860
<v Speaker 4>But do you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the thing about halo is</v>

636
00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:51.080
<v Speaker 7>they built the game of halo for that </v>
<v Speaker 7>dual stick controller and if you're a pc</v>

637
00:23:51.081 --> 00:23:56.081
<v Speaker 7>guy is used to that level of accuracy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It feels like you're like drunkenly </v>

638
00:23:56.081 --> 00:23:58.730
<v Speaker 7>using like a rubber hose to a your car.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But if you build a game for it,</v>

639
00:23:58.790 --> 00:24:00.260
<v Speaker 7>it can work.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And that's what halo did.</v>

640
00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:02.060
<v Speaker 7>Golden,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I did it before that.</v>

641
00:24:02.061 --> 00:24:07.061
<v Speaker 7>But you look at Halo,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they basically introduced a genre that </v>

642
00:24:07.061 --> 00:24:09.641
<v Speaker 7>was new to a whole generation of kids.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I have this whole 10 year rule where </v>

643
00:24:09.641 --> 00:24:09.641
<v Speaker 7>like the kids who played halo,</v>
<v Speaker 7>most of them,</v>

644
00:24:09.641 --> 00:24:12.320
<v Speaker 7>many of them didn't play a lot of quake </v>
<v Speaker 7>because they're like,</v>

645
00:24:12.321 --> 00:24:13.520
<v Speaker 7>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what does this new xbox thing?</v>

646
00:24:13.521 --> 00:24:15.380
<v Speaker 7>I'm gonna play this.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then they become hooked.</v>

647
00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:20.590
<v Speaker 7>It's like the.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We talked about vampires on the way </v>

648
00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:20.590
<v Speaker 7>over.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>

649
00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:23.170
<v Speaker 7>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well all these kids who love twilight </v>

650
00:24:23.170 --> 00:24:23.170
<v Speaker 7>don't know what buffy the vampire slayer</v>
<v Speaker 7>is.</v>

651
00:24:23.170 --> 00:24:24.170
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but if you wait 10 years,</v>

652
00:24:24.171 --> 00:24:29.171
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Your kid who liked buffy the vampire </v>

653
00:24:29.171 --> 00:24:29.171
<v Speaker 7>slayer or you're a person who likes a </v>
<v Speaker 7>twilight.</v>

654
00:24:29.171 --> 00:24:30.080
<v Speaker 7>They were what like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

655
00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:32.510
<v Speaker 7>six when buffy came out and now they're </v>
<v Speaker 7>16.</v>

656
00:24:32.770 --> 00:24:34.040
<v Speaker 7>And so they,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they didn't know about that.</v>

657
00:24:34.041 --> 00:24:37.580
<v Speaker 7>So you can basically wait every 10 years</v>
<v Speaker 7>and find something that was old and make</v>

658
00:24:37.581 --> 00:24:42.581
<v Speaker 7>it new.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then if you can introduce it with </v>

659
00:24:42.581 --> 00:24:42.581
<v Speaker 7>new technology,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you might be good to go.</v>

660
00:24:42.581 --> 00:24:43.230
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

661
00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:44.870
<v Speaker 6>for people who don't know what we're </v>
<v Speaker 6>talking about,</v>

662
00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:49.400
<v Speaker 6>those a hand controllers,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the consoles,</v>

663
00:24:49.401 --> 00:24:52.550
<v Speaker 6>when you have a console,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you have xbox or playstation,</v>

664
00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:57.730
<v Speaker 6>what they are,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's most people are listening on </v>

665
00:24:57.730 --> 00:24:57.730
<v Speaker 6>Itunes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the same help,</v>

666
00:24:57.730 --> 00:24:58.600
<v Speaker 6>but he's holding one up but they have a </v>
<v Speaker 6>bunch of buttons on it.</v>

667
00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:00.050
<v Speaker 6>And with,</v>
<v Speaker 6>with pcs,</v>

668
00:25:00.051 --> 00:25:02.270
<v Speaker 6>when you play with a computer,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when you play online,</v>

669
00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:07.300
<v Speaker 6>especially your,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what you're using is a keyboard and the </v>

670
00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:07.540
<v Speaker 6>mouse and what it is is for whatever </v>
<v Speaker 6>reason,</v>

671
00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:09.980
<v Speaker 6>the keyboard and the mouse,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can just control it better.</v>

672
00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:13.190
<v Speaker 6>You're far more accurate,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're accurate with the keyboard as far</v>

673
00:25:13.191 --> 00:25:15.830
<v Speaker 6>as your movement,</v>
<v Speaker 6>having four very specific buttons,</v>

674
00:25:15.831 --> 00:25:19.220
<v Speaker 6>right where your fingers are and you're </v>
<v Speaker 6>much more accurate with your hand as far</v>

675
00:25:19.221 --> 00:25:24.221
<v Speaker 6>as like aiming.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's where it came into play with </v>

676
00:25:24.221 --> 00:25:27.520
<v Speaker 6>games like quake is like aim,</v>
<v Speaker 6>especially when the rail gun came about </v>

677
00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:27.520
<v Speaker 6>and became very,</v>
<v Speaker 6>very important.</v>

678
00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:30.920
<v Speaker 6>So how do they optimize these games for </v>
<v Speaker 6>these controls?</v>

679
00:25:30.921 --> 00:25:33.470
<v Speaker 6>Do they have auto aim or something?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You get close,</v>

680
00:25:33.471 --> 00:25:34.950
<v Speaker 6>you're in the neighborhood of it and </v>
<v Speaker 6>it'll.</v>

681
00:25:35.850 --> 00:25:40.850
<v Speaker 7>There was one of the things that halo </v>
<v Speaker 7>did was they kind of introduced this </v>

682
00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:41.530
<v Speaker 7>idea of friction and adhesions,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so what you do is if you,</v>

683
00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:46.560
<v Speaker 7>when you move your,</v>
<v Speaker 7>your console kind of stick over the </v>

684
00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:49.231
<v Speaker 7>enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The game actually slows down a little </v>

685
00:25:49.231 --> 00:25:49.231
<v Speaker 7>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like it's like,</v>

686
00:25:49.231 --> 00:25:49.231
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you want to hit them,</v>

687
00:25:49.231 --> 00:25:53.011
<v Speaker 7>don't you?</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then it provides a little bit of </v>

688
00:25:53.011 --> 00:25:53.011
<v Speaker 7>that kind of assistance.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

689
00:25:53.011 --> 00:25:54.070
<v Speaker 7>That would drive me crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Whole generation loves it right now.</v>

690
00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:56.490
<v Speaker 6>Those fucks,</v>
<v Speaker 6>those lazy constant march what it is,</v>

691
00:25:56.500 --> 00:26:01.500
<v Speaker 6>they don't even want to aim these </v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking kids that a self righteous and </v>

692
00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:01.830
<v Speaker 6>titled Children Back when we were </v>
<v Speaker 6>acquired,</v>

693
00:26:01.890 --> 00:26:04.420
<v Speaker 6>we aim.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was a pixel.</v>

694
00:26:04.421 --> 00:26:04.840
<v Speaker 6>That dude,</v>

695
00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:05.860
<v Speaker 7>that's what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

696
00:26:06.370 --> 00:26:08.530
<v Speaker 7>Your crosshair was this one pixel and </v>
<v Speaker 7>you had to shoot.</v>

697
00:26:08.531 --> 00:26:11.740
<v Speaker 7>That guy's edbd had across the map,</v>
<v Speaker 7>except for in quake one where you had to</v>

698
00:26:11.741 --> 00:26:14.140
<v Speaker 7>just hit them with a rocket launcher.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The had radius of half a mile.</v>

699
00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:19.350
<v Speaker 6>That was the cool thing about quick too </v>
<v Speaker 6>is a lot of people would put their own </v>

700
00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:19.350
<v Speaker 6>crosshairs in.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They would build their own cross hairs,</v>

701
00:26:19.450 --> 00:26:21.220
<v Speaker 6>but quick three that came out of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>box,</v>

702
00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:22.480
<v Speaker 6>like a bunch of cool ones,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

703
00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:23.980
<v Speaker 6>like figure out what was the best for </v>
<v Speaker 6>you.</v>

704
00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:25.980
<v Speaker 6>Like I would have different ones for the</v>
<v Speaker 6>rail gun,</v>

705
00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:27.710
<v Speaker 6>different ones for the rocket launcher.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's all.</v>

706
00:26:27.711 --> 00:26:30.340
<v Speaker 6>It's all customization,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's insanity is what it is.</v>

707
00:26:30.341 --> 00:26:35.341
<v Speaker 6>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a constant subject on this fucking </v>

708
00:26:35.341 --> 00:26:35.341
<v Speaker 6>side.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you trust the pots or whatever it is?</v>

709
00:26:35.341 --> 00:26:39.891
<v Speaker 6>Millions and millions of kids that are </v>
<v Speaker 6>perfectly fine with the two sticks and </v>

710
00:26:39.891 --> 00:26:39.891
<v Speaker 6>they're going to grow up pussies.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We are.</v>

711
00:26:39.891 --> 00:26:44.070
<v Speaker 6>We're entering what I like to say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're entering into the feedback list </v>

712
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:44.070
<v Speaker 6>generation,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

713
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:44.070
<v Speaker 6>Those kids growing up</v>

714
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:45.840
<v Speaker 5>with those consoles,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is the last,</v>

715
00:26:45.841 --> 00:26:50.841
<v Speaker 5>the fall of Rome.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This was when they were getting drunk </v>

716
00:26:50.841 --> 00:26:52.080
<v Speaker 5>and throwing up and trying to get more </v>
<v Speaker 5>food in that sort of is gluttony.</v>

717
00:26:52.550 --> 00:26:54.090
<v Speaker 5>He touched him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Joe,</v>

718
00:26:54.091 --> 00:26:55.320
<v Speaker 5>look at touch screens.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look at,</v>

719
00:26:55.350 --> 00:27:00.350
<v Speaker 5>look at connect.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're getting to a point where people </v>

720
00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:00.350
<v Speaker 5>don't need buttons right now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which you,</v>

721
00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:01.950
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that what's going to happen?</v>

722
00:27:01.951 --> 00:27:03.420
<v Speaker 5>Is it going to be like gaming with your </v>
<v Speaker 5>fingers and.</v>

723
00:27:03.421 --> 00:27:07.560
<v Speaker 5>Shit like pointing where you want to do </v>
<v Speaker 5>the Microsoft thing is Ryan,</v>

724
00:27:07.561 --> 00:27:08.410
<v Speaker 5>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's.</v>

725
00:27:08.411 --> 00:27:09.870
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what is that called?</v>

726
00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:11.420
<v Speaker 5>Connect men connect.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

727
00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:16.430
<v Speaker 5>You don't need a controller and you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You stand in front of it and move </v>

728
00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:16.590
<v Speaker 5>around.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess you haven't.</v>

729
00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:18.750
<v Speaker 5>Have you heard much about this?</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is not that much.</v>

730
00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:24.140
<v Speaker 5>I know this is going to trip you out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it's a camera that can track your </v>

731
00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:24.960
<v Speaker 5>body movements without anything on you.</v>

732
00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:26.430
<v Speaker 5>You've seen the motion capture systems,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

733
00:27:26.431 --> 00:27:28.440
<v Speaker 5>You know the type that would set up with</v>
<v Speaker 5>whereas a spandex and all that.</v>

734
00:27:28.650 --> 00:27:33.650
<v Speaker 5>This is a very light version of that </v>
<v Speaker 5>where you just stand in front of the TV </v>

735
00:27:33.650 --> 00:27:34.500
<v Speaker 5>and it can procedurally form your </v>
<v Speaker 5>skeleton and then track that.</v>

736
00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:36.630
<v Speaker 5>So there's a dance game.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dance Central,</v>

737
00:27:36.631 --> 00:27:41.631
<v Speaker 5>which is a ton of fun.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just playing with my niece over the </v>

738
00:27:41.631 --> 00:27:43.341
<v Speaker 5>holidays.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You literally just dance right in front </v>

739
00:27:43.341 --> 00:27:43.341
<v Speaker 5>of it attracts your movement.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It can judge your score.</v>

740
00:27:43.341 --> 00:27:44.130
<v Speaker 5>Here's where it gets weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There is a video,</v>

741
00:27:44.131 --> 00:27:49.131
<v Speaker 5>like a microphone on it so it can do </v>
<v Speaker 5>voice recognition and it's got facial </v>

742
00:27:49.131 --> 00:27:53.421
<v Speaker 5>recognition on it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So once you do the facial recognition </v>

743
00:27:53.421 --> 00:27:56.871
<v Speaker 5>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which makes you stay out of the room to </v>

744
00:27:56.871 --> 00:27:56.871
<v Speaker 5>kind of build an aggregate of your face,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

745
00:27:56.871 --> 00:27:57.510
<v Speaker 5>you then can just walk in the room.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It goes,</v>

746
00:27:57.540 --> 00:27:58.560
<v Speaker 5>why hello cliff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

747
00:27:58.561 --> 00:28:02.700
<v Speaker 5>oh Jesus fucking Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I smoke too much weed for that dude.</v>

748
00:28:02.701 --> 00:28:05.220
<v Speaker 5>I don't want my computer talking to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I want to see.</v>

749
00:28:05.221 --> 00:28:10.221
<v Speaker 5>I want to see imax movies like screens </v>
<v Speaker 5>like where you walk in and you're all </v>

750
00:28:10.221 --> 00:28:15.111
<v Speaker 5>sitting there in the video game.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there's like 500 people all joining </v>

751
00:28:15.111 --> 00:28:16.560
<v Speaker 5>in plain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This huge video game</v>

752
00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:21.580
<v Speaker 6>in front of you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like I told you about from doing </v>

753
00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:21.640
<v Speaker 6>standup.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He said,</v>

754
00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:25.820
<v Speaker 6>my friend John [inaudible] has been </v>
<v Speaker 6>doing these conference stand up.</v>

755
00:28:25.821 --> 00:28:30.821
<v Speaker 6>Things were there in front of it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>some new technology where they get them </v>

756
00:28:30.821 --> 00:28:32.990
<v Speaker 6>in a room and he's got all these screens</v>
<v Speaker 6>in front of them and they see him and he</v>

757
00:28:32.991 --> 00:28:35.220
<v Speaker 6>sees them live and he does standup.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Really?</v>

758
00:28:35.221 --> 00:28:40.221
<v Speaker 6>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's doing a desk in front of like all </v>

759
00:28:40.221 --> 00:28:40.800
<v Speaker 6>these monitors.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So he gets to see the reaction like yes,</v>

760
00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:43.010
<v Speaker 6>two way video.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So he's watching the reaction.</v>

761
00:28:43.011 --> 00:28:45.620
<v Speaker 6>They're watching him live,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's like he's performing on stage,</v>

762
00:28:45.621 --> 00:28:48.170
<v Speaker 6>but he's nowhere near that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're talking the shit.</v>

763
00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:51.500
<v Speaker 6>I would love that if I could do shows </v>
<v Speaker 6>from my house and not have to travel all</v>

764
00:28:51.501 --> 00:28:52.230
<v Speaker 6>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That was good.</v>

765
00:28:52.450 --> 00:28:53.540
<v Speaker 5>You Judge People's reactions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

766
00:28:53.541 --> 00:28:55.570
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's what we're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 5>iteration,</v>

767
00:28:55.571 --> 00:29:00.571
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and how much we panned for gold and we </v>

768
00:29:00.571 --> 00:29:00.571
<v Speaker 5>try and find fun and we fail a bunch </v>
<v Speaker 5>before we figured out what it is.</v>

769
00:29:00.571 --> 00:29:01.600
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>talk about Jerry Seinfeld's comedian,</v>

770
00:29:01.601 --> 00:29:04.270
<v Speaker 5>how much comedy they.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They go to the little dive bars and they</v>

771
00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:07.300
<v Speaker 5>do a surprise appearance and they just </v>
<v Speaker 5>bomb and then they figure out,</v>

772
00:29:07.301 --> 00:29:08.230
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this joke work.</v>

773
00:29:08.231 --> 00:29:09.370
<v Speaker 5>That one didn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this one did.</v>

774
00:29:09.371 --> 00:29:09.650
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

775
00:29:10.030 --> 00:29:11.710
<v Speaker 5>we find it's the same thing with game </v>
<v Speaker 5>development.</v>

776
00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:13.990
<v Speaker 5>I know people in the restaurant business</v>
<v Speaker 5>that try new menus,</v>

777
00:29:13.991 --> 00:29:15.710
<v Speaker 5>they figure out what works and does it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's all iteration.</v>

778
00:29:15.711 --> 00:29:20.711
<v Speaker 5>Nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Very few people ever actually nail it </v>

779
00:29:20.711 --> 00:29:20.711
<v Speaker 5>right the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

780
00:29:20.711 --> 00:29:24.080
<v Speaker 5>We'll fail early and fail often,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which I found is the key to so many </v>

781
00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:24.080
<v Speaker 5>instances of success in life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

782
00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:27.890
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you fail and then you find out what you </v>

783
00:29:27.890 --> 00:29:27.890
<v Speaker 6>don't like about what failed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yep.</v>

784
00:29:27.890 --> 00:29:27.890
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and that's how you learn.</v>

785
00:29:27.890 --> 00:29:32.750
<v Speaker 6>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You have to learn what you do and don't </v>

786
00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:32.750
<v Speaker 6>like and when you're doing something </v>
<v Speaker 6>complicated,</v>

787
00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:32.820
<v Speaker 6>there's a lot of failure involved.</v>
<v Speaker 6>For sure.</v>

788
00:29:32.910 --> 00:29:34.270
<v Speaker 5>Keyboard man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a,</v>

789
00:29:34.271 --> 00:29:39.271
<v Speaker 5>it's still relevant but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's the market split between fall </v>

790
00:29:39.271 --> 00:29:43.420
<v Speaker 5>between des,</v>
<v Speaker 5>between like I see no controller is very</v>

791
00:29:43.421 --> 00:29:46.150
<v Speaker 5>important.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think like making it so it could be,</v>

792
00:29:46.151 --> 00:29:51.151
<v Speaker 5>you could do just sit there and do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What I don't like though is when a lot </v>

793
00:29:51.151 --> 00:29:54.961
<v Speaker 5>of times I just want to sit back and </v>
<v Speaker 5>play a video game in bed or I'm just </v>

794
00:29:56.291 --> 00:29:58.080
<v Speaker 5>trying to run through the forest.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

795
00:29:59.030 --> 00:30:00.870
<v Speaker 5>you don't want to sweat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't,</v>

796
00:30:00.871 --> 00:30:05.871
<v Speaker 5>you just want to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you want to lay back and just sit there </v>

797
00:30:05.871 --> 00:30:05.871
<v Speaker 5>with the controller display,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

798
00:30:05.871 --> 00:30:05.871
<v Speaker 5>You don't have to jump around like an </v>
<v Speaker 5>idiot.</v>

799
00:30:05.871 --> 00:30:07.030
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I sit here and go like this though,</v>

800
00:30:07.031 --> 00:30:09.290
<v Speaker 5>like tron style and just move my hands </v>
<v Speaker 5>like Doo Doo.</v>

801
00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:14.310
<v Speaker 5>I'm going through.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When they're working on type stuff like </v>

802
00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:14.310
<v Speaker 5>minority report,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where are you gonna?</v>

803
00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:15.030
<v Speaker 5>Be able to just keep it like that so you</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't have to like mark.</v>

804
00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:17.170
<v Speaker 5>There's a certain percentage of person,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of them out there,</v>

805
00:30:17.171 --> 00:30:22.171
<v Speaker 5>especially girls.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you handled the current console </v>

806
00:30:22.171 --> 00:30:24.181
<v Speaker 5>controller,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they act like you handed them a flaming </v>

807
00:30:24.181 --> 00:30:24.181
<v Speaker 5>bag of dog shit.</v>

00:30:24.671 --> 00:30:27.340
<v Speaker 5>Like I don't want to play this and </v>
<v Speaker 5>granted there are some exceptions,</v>

810
00:30:27.341 --> 00:30:30.690
<v Speaker 5>but most people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>parents like you're met with cliff.</v>

00:30:32.671 --> 00:30:33.310
<v Speaker 5>That was a nine.</v>

<v Speaker 5>He is play a game.</v>

816
00:30:42.530 --> 00:30:44.240
<v Speaker 5>The.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We have this whole theory that there's a</v>

817
00:30:44.241 --> 00:30:49.241
<v Speaker 5>certain type of girl that somehow gets </v>
<v Speaker 5>that voice preloaded into her with that </v>

818
00:30:49.241 --> 00:30:53.021
<v Speaker 5>bubbled writing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think they just imitate everybody </v>

819
00:30:53.021 --> 00:30:53.021
<v Speaker 5>else.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

822
00:30:55.390 --> 00:30:56.360

<v Speaker 5>they just imitate it still.</v>

<v Speaker 5>In November,</v>

867
00:32:36.761 --> 00:32:38.440
<v Speaker 5>the snow would hit and I'd get up at </v>

872
00:32:46.041 --> 00:32:48.200

<v Speaker 5>is this how it is?</v>

875
00:32:52.551 --> 00:32:57.551
<v Speaker 5>Because my dad loved him dearly but he </v>
<v Speaker 5>was super cheap about the heat and he'd </v>

876
00:32:57.551 --> 00:33:01.191
<v Speaker 5>like it 90 turn off and like in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Monday morning getting up and going to </v>

877
00:33:01.191 --> 00:33:01.191
<v Speaker 5>school.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

878
00:33:01.191 --> 00:33:03.080
<v Speaker 5>it's the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like getting into that shower man.</v>

879
00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:08.140
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we used to have to use a hairdryer to </v>

880
00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:09.380
<v Speaker 5>unf on clog the pipes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The pipes would freeze.</v>

881
00:33:09.410 --> 00:33:14.410
<v Speaker 5>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So my dad had like this opening </v>

882
00:33:14.410 --> 00:33:16.630
<v Speaker 5>underneath the floor in the basement and</v>
<v Speaker 5>he would have to lift up this opening </v>

883
00:33:16.630 --> 00:33:19.960
<v Speaker 5>and it'd be sitting there with a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 5>hairdryer before anybody could take a </v>

884
00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:20.360
<v Speaker 5>shower.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But we retaliate who's retarded?</v>

885
00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:25.390
<v Speaker 5>We grew up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my dad decided one year he was going to </v>

886
00:33:25.390 --> 00:33:25.390
<v Speaker 5>buy a coal stove that was going to like </v>
<v Speaker 5>take care of all this.</v>

887
00:33:25.390 --> 00:33:29.741
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he gets it installed and literally </v>

888
00:33:29.741 --> 00:33:29.920
<v Speaker 5>like a one folly as two tons of coal </v>
<v Speaker 5>put,</v>

889
00:33:29.930 --> 00:33:31.370
<v Speaker 5>like put it in the basement.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

890
00:33:31.670 --> 00:33:36.670
<v Speaker 5>And we literally have to go down there </v>
<v Speaker 5>with a hopper and like bring it up </v>

891
00:33:36.670 --> 00:33:36.670
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you have to hold your breath,</v>

892
00:33:36.670 --> 00:33:39.701
<v Speaker 5>otherwise you get black lung basically.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And we come up and like this thing he </v>

893
00:33:39.701 --> 00:33:39.701
<v Speaker 5>did like two square feet of the whole </v>
<v Speaker 5>house.</v>

894
00:33:39.701 --> 00:33:44.620
<v Speaker 5>So if you want it to stay warm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you stayed in the living room and just </v>

895
00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:45.140
<v Speaker 5>hovered right in front of that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

896
00:33:45.141 --> 00:33:46.400
<v Speaker 5>We had four.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got four of the brothers,</v>

897
00:33:46.401 --> 00:33:47.660
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've grown up with that in one house and</v>

898
00:33:47.661 --> 00:33:49.490
<v Speaker 5>it was a decent size house.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But one of the.</v>

<v Speaker 5>stove in the middle of the living room </v>

905
00:34:05.861 --> 00:34:08.810
<v Speaker 5>and they were talking about how </v>
<v Speaker 5>economical it is to use this wood </v>

00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:25.820
<v Speaker 7>urban legend story.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was the,</v>

<v Speaker 7>the video game,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

1018
00:38:26.701 --> 00:38:29.550
<v Speaker 7>And the Atari Twenty 600 and they </v>
<v Speaker 7>basically assumed it would sell millions</v>

1019
00:38:29.551 --> 00:38:31.410
<v Speaker 7>of copies and it sold like five.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh my goodness.</v>

<v Speaker 7>buried it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Why</v>

1023
00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:37.550

<v Speaker 5>Because I don't know.</v>

1024
00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:41.800
<v Speaker 5>I guess they didn't confront somebody </v>
<v Speaker 5>better and whatever disposal economics,</v>

1025
00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:47.820
<v Speaker 5>huge landfill filled with that game and </v>

<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1028
00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:51.490
<v Speaker 5>people think it's an urban legend,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's actually true,</v>

1029
00:38:51.491 --> 00:38:53.380
<v Speaker 5>but what is the number in the urban </v>
<v Speaker 5>legend?</v>

1030
00:38:53.410 --> 00:38:54.490
<v Speaker 5>It's millions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>millions,</v>

1031
00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:56.130
<v Speaker 5>millions because they hired some </v>
<v Speaker 5>programmer.</v>

1032
00:38:56.140 --> 00:38:57.540
<v Speaker 5>It had to make the game over the course </v>
<v Speaker 5>of a month.</v>

<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like no,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Like the new call of duty was done by </v>

1036
00:39:05.281 --> 00:39:07.921
<v Speaker 5>the second team,</v>

<v Speaker 6>Imax,</v>
<v Speaker 6>imax theaters.</v>

1177
00:44:27.591 --> 00:44:30.990
<v Speaker 6>Imagine that concert where you're all </v>
<v Speaker 6>together in a</v>

1178
00:44:33.610 --> 00:44:38.610
<v Speaker 1>world of warcraft everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone would just plug into their </v>

1179
00:44:38.610 --> 00:44:42.160
<v Speaker 1>computer and be some sort of an Elf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd just wandering through the forest </v>

1180
00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:43.590
<v Speaker 1>and we'd all turn into the apartment on </v>
<v Speaker 1>South Park with a whale episode.</v>

<v Speaker 1>we're doing here?</v>

1182
00:44:45.871 --> 00:44:50.070

00:44:55.460 --> 00:44:55.460
<v Speaker 1>hooked up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1185
00:44:55.460 --> 00:44:58.580
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>computer singularity.</v>

<v Speaker 1>fascinating for people who don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I just found this out today,</v>

1225
00:46:21.940 --> 00:46:26.940
<v Speaker 1>already brought it up yesterday or day </v>
<v Speaker 1>before when we had the podcast and then </v>

1226
00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:26.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was it yesterday?</v>

1227
00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:27.490
<v Speaker 1>Yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yesterday.</v>

1228
00:46:27.750 --> 00:46:30.790
<v Speaker 1>I already brought it up yesterday at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast and then today I went online and</v>

1229
00:46:30.791 --> 00:46:31.570
<v Speaker 1>started looking it up.</v>

1230
00:46:31.870 --> 00:46:36.870
<v Speaker 1>The guy was arrested for surprise sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright buddy.</v>

1231
00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:42.660
<v Speaker 1>The guy was arrested because his condom </v>
<v Speaker 1>broke and he didn't tell her that's the </v>

1232
00:46:42.660 --> 00:46:44.800
<v Speaker 1>crime and apparently it's only a crime </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Sweden,</v>

1233
00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:49.980
<v Speaker 1>like this is nuts like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an Interpol look to try to get this guy </v>

1234
00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:53.360
<v Speaker 1>and bring them in for questioning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this is the charge girls to try to </v>

1235
00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:54.040
<v Speaker 1>get married that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to put this woman that he did it with.</v>

1236
00:46:54.070 --> 00:46:59.070
<v Speaker 1>The woman who he had sex with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This chick has published websites like </v>

1237
00:46:59.070 --> 00:47:01.570
<v Speaker 1>with a detailed list of how to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>revenge on men.</v>

1238
00:47:02.590 --> 00:47:07.590
<v Speaker 1>It's this craziness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the idea that this is enough to </v>

1239
00:47:07.590 --> 00:47:10.990
<v Speaker 1>bring this guy into justice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Internet is going to stop that man.</v>

1240
00:47:11.050 --> 00:47:16.050
<v Speaker 1>There's some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some shit is going to go down from this </v>

1241
00:47:16.050 --> 00:47:16.050
<v Speaker 1>and say I'm going to be this easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really</v>

1242
00:47:16.050 --> 00:47:19.820
<v Speaker 7>hard for any organized system to fight </v>
<v Speaker 7>because somebody somewhere is going to </v>

1243
00:47:19.820 --> 00:47:22.380
<v Speaker 7>be willing to host something and how </v>
<v Speaker 7>many places you're going to break down.</v>

1244
00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:24.390
<v Speaker 7>Shut it down.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's one head of like,</v>

1245
00:47:24.391 --> 00:47:25.350
<v Speaker 7>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this is fascinating.</v>

1246
00:47:25.351 --> 00:47:26.940
<v Speaker 7>There's information I shouldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 7>seeing that,</v>

1247
00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:28.710
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>maybe some of it needs to be exposed and</v>

1248
00:47:28.711 --> 00:47:30.910
<v Speaker 7>on the other hand I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this is national security man.</v>

1249
00:47:30.911 --> 00:47:35.911
<v Speaker 7>Like we're talking about serious stuff </v>
<v Speaker 7>that could really put people's lives at </v>

1250
00:47:35.911 --> 00:47:35.911
<v Speaker 7>risk.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So I,</v>

1251
00:47:35.911 --> 00:47:35.911
<v Speaker 7>I'm on the fence with it,</v>

1252
00:47:35.911 --> 00:47:37.220
<v Speaker 6>both sides of it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can see both sides of it too,</v>

1253
00:47:37.221 --> 00:47:39.520
<v Speaker 6>but I can't see defending against it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1254
00:47:39.521 --> 00:47:44.521
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think it's right or don't think </v>

1255
00:47:44.521 --> 00:47:46.351
<v Speaker 6>it's wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I can't see stopping it from </v>

1256
00:47:46.351 --> 00:47:48.631
<v Speaker 6>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When you fuck with people that are that </v>

1257
00:47:48.631 --> 00:47:50.491
<v Speaker 6>powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they find some sort of way to get to </v>

1258
00:47:50.491 --> 00:47:50.491
<v Speaker 6>you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know,</v>

1259
00:47:50.491 --> 00:47:51.850
<v Speaker 6>but that's what's fascinating about this</v>
<v Speaker 6>is how transparent it is.</v>

1260
00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:54.730
<v Speaker 6>It's incredibly transparent that all of </v>
<v Speaker 6>a sudden this woman,</v>

1261
00:47:54.731 --> 00:47:57.280
<v Speaker 6>who by the way has CIA ties follow my </v>
<v Speaker 6>twitter,</v>

1262
00:47:57.281 --> 00:48:02.281
<v Speaker 6>just go to Joe Rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a bunch of things that are </v>

1263

1278
00:48:34.700 --> 00:48:37.900
<v Speaker 7>Those things didn't happen sooner.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I remember sitting there and uh,</v>

1279
00:48:37.901 --> 00:48:40.120
<v Speaker 7>I had a friend right about the time we </v>
<v Speaker 7>were working on real one.</v>

1280
00:48:40.121 --> 00:48:45.121
<v Speaker 7>This is about 97 and I went over to his </v>
<v Speaker 7>house and he was downloading like full </v>

1281
00:48:45.121 --> 00:48:48.541
<v Speaker 7>high quality,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like Hollywood movies off of a website </v>

1282
00:48:48.541 --> 00:48:48.541
<v Speaker 7>and this was [inaudible] 97.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Wow.</v>

1283
00:48:48.541 --> 00:48:50.860
<v Speaker 7>I'm sitting here going and now it's like</v>
<v Speaker 7>bit torrent is everywhere,</v>

1284
00:48:50.861 --> 00:48:51.360
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like,</v>

1285
00:48:51.361 --> 00:48:56.361
<v Speaker 7>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And you have a generation that doesn't </v>

1286
00:48:56.361 --> 00:48:56.361
<v Speaker 7>want to pay for shit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

1287
00:48:56.361 --> 00:48:56.361
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like the Scott pilgrim movies.</v>

1288
00:48:56.361 --> 00:48:56.620
<v Speaker 7>You see that Brian?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yes.</v>

1289
00:48:56.830 --> 00:48:59.410
<v Speaker 7>One of my favorite movies out of </v>
<v Speaker 7>nowhere.</v>

1290
00:48:59.411 --> 00:49:03.190
<v Speaker 7>I can't believe they pulled it off.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I thought it was a meet Edgar Wright who</v>

1291
00:49:03.191 --> 00:49:04.240
<v Speaker 7>did Shaun of the dead,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

1292
00:49:04.241 --> 00:49:09.241
<v Speaker 7>It was just a great movie.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And what happened was a bond at the box </v>

1293
00:49:09.241 --> 00:49:12.961
<v Speaker 7>office,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but at the same time it was like a </v>

1294
00:49:12.961 --> 00:49:12.961
<v Speaker 7>perfect movie for the Gamer.</v>

1295
00:49:12.961 --> 00:49:12.961
<v Speaker 7>Neurogeneration write a hipster </v>
<v Speaker 7>generation even.</v>

1296
00:49:12.961 --> 00:49:13.690

<v Speaker 7>And uh,</v>

1297
00:49:13.710 --> 00:49:14.920
<v Speaker 7>I saw somebody tweet about it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They're like,</v>

1298
00:49:14.921 --> 00:49:16.360
<v Speaker 7>Scott Pilgrim is the movie this </v>
<v Speaker 7>generation.</v>

1299
00:49:16.361 --> 00:49:18.010
<v Speaker 7>The problem is this generation doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 7>pay for shit.</v>

1300
00:49:18.550 --> 00:49:20.080
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I had a friend of mine one time,</v>

1303
00:49:22.781 --> 00:49:27.781
<v Speaker 7>It was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And it was two weeks before the film </v>

1304
00:49:27.781 --> 00:49:27.781
<v Speaker 7>came out and like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're posting this on your facebook,</v>

<v Speaker 7>somebody in la or something?</v>

<v Speaker 7>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

1307
00:49:29.441 --> 00:49:31.200

<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1308
00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:36.240
<v Speaker 7>People just admit it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Just talk about it openly on people's </v>

1309
00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:36.550
<v Speaker 7>doors.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like the music industry,</v>

1310
00:49:36.551 --> 00:49:41.551
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Nobody wants to be the fucking music </v>

1311
00:49:41.551 --> 00:49:41.551
<v Speaker 7>industry right now.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Mark my words,</v>

1312
00:49:41.551 --> 00:49:44.370
<v Speaker 7>we have to get rid of currency and make </v>
<v Speaker 7>it likes because all those people would </v>

1313
00:49:44.370 --> 00:49:47.491
<v Speaker 7>have liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And so then you just want to collect </v>

1314
00:49:47.491 --> 00:49:47.491
<v Speaker 7>likes,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like they're not even money that's going</v>

1315
00:49:47.491 --> 00:49:48.750
<v Speaker 7>to be the currency in the like sixth </v>
<v Speaker 7>grade.</v>

1316
00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:49.870
<v Speaker 7>Do you like,</v>

<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1318
00:49:50.590 --> 00:49:51.910
<v Speaker 7>But it's kind of point.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

1319
00:49:51.911 --> 00:49:54.550
<v Speaker 7>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Because that's all you're going towards.</v>

1320
00:49:54.551 --> 00:49:58.450
<v Speaker 7>And that's like the new currency would </v>
<v Speaker 7>be a good idea.</v>

1321
00:49:58.750 --> 00:50:01.690
<v Speaker 7>It's actually some sort of a revamped </v>
<v Speaker 7>idea.</v>

1322
00:50:02.020 --> 00:50:03.910
<v Speaker 7>Have you ever actually tried to,</v>
<v Speaker 7>unlike anything on facebook,</v>

<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1324
00:50:05.210 --> 00:50:06.430
<v Speaker 7>But that's how it should be.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1325
00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:09.730
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's easy to get calmed down.</v>

1326
00:50:09.731 --> 00:50:14.731
<v Speaker 7>Drama Queen.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Just to think about this for the crazy </v>

<v Speaker 7>put on somebody's facebook and that was </v>
<v Speaker 7>a part of facebook or are you talking </v>

1334
00:50:35.151 --> 00:50:36.100
<v Speaker 7>Buttons.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's what it was.</v>

1335
00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:37.410
<v Speaker 7>Virtual goods.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Huge.</v>

<v Speaker 7>The whole rage right now in the industry</v>
<v Speaker 7>is they called freemium.</v>

1338
00:50:41.510 --> 00:50:42.890
<v Speaker 7>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like the game is free,</v>

1339
00:50:42.891 --> 00:50:45.860
<v Speaker 7>which is a brilliant idea in a bad </v>
<v Speaker 7>economy and so you start playing it,</v>

1340
00:50:45.861 --> 00:50:47.510
<v Speaker 7>but hey,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you see that guy who is the fancy cowboy</v>

<v Speaker 6>What do you think about this?</v>

1343
00:50:50.521 --> 00:50:55.521
<v Speaker 6>What do you think about games where it's</v>
<v Speaker 6>like like everquest and shit where they </v>

1344
00:50:55.521 --> 00:50:58.790
<v Speaker 6>sell the character that like build up </v>
<v Speaker 6>some crazy super human character and </v>

1345
00:50:58.790 --> 00:51:00.240
<v Speaker 6>then they go sell it to digital farming.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1346
00:51:00.241 --> 00:51:02.410
<v Speaker 6>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1347
00:51:02.670 --> 00:51:02.860
<v Speaker 6>There's</v>

1348
00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:08.440
<v Speaker 7>places where they just.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They busted for world of warcraft where </v>

1349
00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:08.440
<v Speaker 7>they'll sit there and they'll just farm.</v>

1350
00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:08.440
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I watched that on TV,</v>

1351
00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:09.090
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There was this couple.</v>

1352
00:51:09.091 --> 00:51:12.330
<v Speaker 6>There was all about addiction of gaming.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know what the show was,</v>

1353
00:51:12.510 --> 00:51:17.510
<v Speaker 6>but it was a sad,</v>
<v Speaker 6>sad couple men because they weren't </v>

1354
00:51:17.510 --> 00:51:17.510
<v Speaker 6>paying attention to their kid.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Their poor kid was like,</v>

1355
00:51:17.510 --> 00:51:17.510
<v Speaker 6>Mommy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Daddy.</v>

1356
00:51:17.510 --> 00:51:19.020
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

1357
00:51:19.190 --> 00:51:22.020
<v Speaker 6>It was a real TV show.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was at and the one of the things that</v>

1358
00:51:22.021 --> 00:51:24.480
<v Speaker 6>they had is a.</v>
<v Speaker 6>all these people that were in,</v>

1359
00:51:24.870 --> 00:51:26.640
<v Speaker 6>I think it was like Russia or somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 6>like that,</v>

1360
00:51:26.790 --> 00:51:30.930
<v Speaker 6>that were playing games for a Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They build up their account.</v>

1361
00:51:30.931 --> 00:51:32.190
<v Speaker 6>They play all day,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then they sell it.</v>

1362
00:51:32.330 --> 00:51:37.330
<v Speaker 7>This is the fundamental tradeoff that </v>
<v Speaker 7>you have right now is you get to the </v>

1363
00:51:37.330 --> 00:51:37.400
<v Speaker 7>certain point,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we realized there's people often talk in</v>

1364
00:51:37.401 --> 00:51:42.401
<v Speaker 7>the industry about kids versus adults.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Kids have no money and all the time </v>

1365
00:51:42.401 --> 00:51:43.160
<v Speaker 7>adults have very little time and half </v>
<v Speaker 7>the money,</v>

1366
00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:44.810
<v Speaker 7>and so which audience are you?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

1367
00:51:44.811 --> 00:51:46.850
<v Speaker 7>If you can have a person who's can get </v>
<v Speaker 7>paid,</v>

1368
00:51:46.851 --> 00:51:51.851
<v Speaker 7>you know the equivalent to five cents an</v>
<v Speaker 7>hour and every hour you can earn a </v>

1369
00:51:51.851 --> 00:51:52.550
<v Speaker 7>dollar's worth of gold.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's a business model for somebody,</v>

1370
00:51:52.551 --> 00:51:54.230
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't think blizzard is a fan of that.</v>

1371
00:51:54.231 --> 00:51:56.780
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>But once you have eyes,</v>

1372
00:51:56.810 --> 00:51:59.240
<v Speaker 7>like I laugh often talk about the seven </v>
<v Speaker 7>deadly sins is game design,</v>

1373
00:51:59.241 --> 00:52:04.241
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like I walk into this world and I see </v>

1374
00:52:04.241 --> 00:52:04.241
<v Speaker 7>you with your fancy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1375
00:52:04.241 --> 00:52:04.241
<v Speaker 7>two girls went up,</v>
<v Speaker 7>shirt on and I'm like,</v>

1376
00:52:04.241 --> 00:52:04.550
<v Speaker 7>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I want one of those.</v>

1377
00:52:04.551 --> 00:52:05.270
<v Speaker 7>How do I get that?</v>

1378
00:52:05.450 --> 00:52:06.620
<v Speaker 7>And then I envy you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

1379
00:52:06.621 --> 00:52:09.170
<v Speaker 7>And then I wind up getting greed so I </v>
<v Speaker 7>can collect money and then I want to get</v>

1380
00:52:09.171 --> 00:52:14.171
<v Speaker 7>in too many into wind up with gluttony </v>
<v Speaker 7>and then it's just all these start </v>

1381
00:52:14.171 --> 00:52:14.171
<v Speaker 7>factor into each other.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And once you have eyes,</v>

1382
00:52:14.171 --> 00:52:15.770
<v Speaker 7>it's the way the world works.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You see the guy with the nice car.</v>

1383
00:52:15.771 --> 00:52:16.220
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

1384
00:52:16.221 --> 00:52:17.870
<v Speaker 7>I envy him.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I want that nice car.</v>

1385
00:52:18.050 --> 00:52:23.050
<v Speaker 7>You can apply that to the virtual world.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Exactly as you can apply it to the real </v>

1386
00:52:23.050 --> 00:52:25.751
<v Speaker 7>world.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You don't blizzard and world of </v>

1387
00:52:25.751 --> 00:52:25.751
<v Speaker 7>warcraft,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know the exact numbers,</v>

1388
00:52:25.751 --> 00:52:28.541
<v Speaker 7>but they had released a pet whereas it </v>
<v Speaker 7>was like 25 actual dollars or something </v>

1389
00:52:28.541 --> 00:52:29.460
<v Speaker 7>like that and their servers wound up </v>
<v Speaker 7>getting crashed.</v>

1390
00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:32.570
<v Speaker 7>People lining up to buy it just for like</v>
<v Speaker 7>one little pet.</v>

1391
00:52:33.050 --> 00:52:38.050
<v Speaker 6>That's the power of what they've figured</v>
<v Speaker 6>out how to do is make it so that the </v>

1392
00:52:38.050 --> 00:52:40.280
<v Speaker 6>more you play the game,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the better you get.</v>

1393
00:52:40.610 --> 00:52:42.980
<v Speaker 6>The better your life is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The more successful you are,</v>

1394
00:52:42.981 --> 00:52:45.380
<v Speaker 6>the more powerful you are,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the better the experience is,</v>

1395
00:52:45.410 --> 00:52:47.540
<v Speaker 6>the more you have control of the people </v>
<v Speaker 6>in the game.</v>

1396
00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:52.800
<v Speaker 6>And that's like the really trippy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like it's a time thing they like </v>

1397
00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:53.600
<v Speaker 6>locked you in like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's a,</v>

1398
00:52:53.660 --> 00:52:58.660
<v Speaker 6>it's a show that you're totally hooked </v>
<v Speaker 6>on and it never ends and it keeps </v>

1399
00:52:58.660 --> 00:52:58.990
<v Speaker 6>getting crazier.</v>
<v Speaker 6>New</v>

1400
00:52:59.010 --> 00:53:00.200
<v Speaker 7>People and they,</v>
<v Speaker 7>any,</v>

1401
00:53:00.201 --> 00:53:02.940
<v Speaker 7>any blizzard,</v>
<v Speaker 7>mark my words has created this mold that</v>

1402
00:53:02.941 --> 00:53:04.500
<v Speaker 7>so many other people in the position </v>
<v Speaker 7>going to follow.</v>

1403
00:53:04.501 --> 00:53:05.190
<v Speaker 7>We get this,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

1404
00:53:05.490 --> 00:53:07.080
<v Speaker 7>this thing in the new gears and we have </v>
<v Speaker 7>a calendar.</v>

1405
00:53:07.900 --> 00:53:09.420
<v Speaker 7>It's like you play gears and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh hey,</v>

1406
00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:14.720
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>don't trade in your game because in two </v>

1407
00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:14.720
<v Speaker 7>weeks there's like ticker Tuesday or </v>
<v Speaker 7>triple sp Thursdays.</v>

1408
00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:19.010
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then your friends are playing on </v>

1409
00:53:19.010 --> 00:53:19.010
<v Speaker 7>that same day and you want to keep </v>
<v Speaker 7>going.</v>

1410
00:53:19.010 --> 00:53:22.011
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And maybe there's like a psychologist </v>

1411
00:53:22.011 --> 00:53:22.011
<v Speaker 7>trick.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There were like,</v>

1412
00:53:22.011 --> 00:53:24.321
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you don't sell the game because you're </v>

1413
00:53:24.321 --> 00:53:24.321
<v Speaker 7>thinking there might be something coming</v>
<v Speaker 7>up.</v>

1414
00:53:24.321 --> 00:53:27.681
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>We're dungeon masters and we're always </v>

1415
00:53:27.681 --> 00:53:27.681
<v Speaker 7>like manipulating experience online to </v>
<v Speaker 7>have</v>

1416
00:53:27.681 --> 00:53:28.050
<v Speaker 4>new shit happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1417
00:53:28.051 --> 00:53:30.300
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of crazy that it just keeps </v>
<v Speaker 4>going though.</v>

1418
00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:33.390
<v Speaker 4>But I mean your average person have over</v>
<v Speaker 4>their life.</v>

1419
00:53:33.391 --> 00:53:38.391
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So in a world where you start gaining </v>

1420
00:53:38.391 --> 00:53:40.791
<v Speaker 4>that control as like the biggest problem</v>
<v Speaker 4>is like when you're young is figuring </v>

1421
00:53:40.791 --> 00:53:40.791
<v Speaker 4>out what you want to do when you grow </v>
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>

1422
00:53:41.130 --> 00:53:41.980
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that.</v>

1423
00:53:42.020 --> 00:53:44.190
<v Speaker 4>Thankfully I was lucky and I saw games.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like boom.</v>

1424
00:53:44.191 --> 00:53:49.191
<v Speaker 4>That I've talked to kids are like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to school and I don't know </v>

1425
00:53:49.191 --> 00:53:49.191
<v Speaker 4>what I want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1426
00:53:49.191 --> 00:53:53.511
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pick something and be surgical about it </v>

1427
00:53:53.511 --> 00:53:53.511
<v Speaker 4>and decide that you're gonna be the best</v>
<v Speaker 4>at that.</v>

1428
00:53:53.511 --> 00:53:55.680
<v Speaker 4>But the problem is finding something for</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of kids,</v>

1429
00:53:55.681 --> 00:53:58.020
<v Speaker 4>the real issue is finding something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then you got lucky.</v>

1430
00:53:58.021 --> 00:54:03.021
<v Speaker 4>I got lucky a lot of people did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's like it's very difficult to </v>

1431
00:54:03.021 --> 00:54:03.570
<v Speaker 4>find the thing that you're into know you</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't want to like say,</v>

1432
00:54:03.571 --> 00:54:04.560
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be this,</v>

1433
00:54:04.561 --> 00:54:09.561
<v Speaker 4>and then you're doing it and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>halfway into you're like this fucking </v>

1434
00:54:09.561 --> 00:54:09.561
<v Speaker 4>belonging.</v>

1435
00:54:09.561 --> 00:54:09.570
<v Speaker 4>So it's difficult to find what that </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing is.</v>

1436
00:54:09.571 --> 00:54:11.050
<v Speaker 4>It's like asking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>asking it a young,</v>

1437
00:54:11.100 --> 00:54:12.450
<v Speaker 4>especially at a young age when you don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

1438
00:54:12.750 --> 00:54:14.730
<v Speaker 4>you hardly know a lot about what's going</v>
<v Speaker 4>on in the world around you.</v>

1439
00:54:14.910 --> 00:54:19.910
<v Speaker 4>But at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that opportunity now with the internet </v>

1440
00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:19.910
<v Speaker 4>is greater than ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1441
00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:22.200
<v Speaker 4>Like you could shoot a viral video,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could start a podcast,</v>

1442
00:54:22.201 --> 00:54:27.201
<v Speaker 4>you can do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you start getting better and </v>

1443
00:54:27.201 --> 00:54:27.201
<v Speaker 4>better at it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can build community,</v>

1444
00:54:27.201 --> 00:54:27.201
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If that's what you want to do.</v>

1445
00:54:27.201 --> 00:54:28.880
<v Speaker 4>But what if you want to be a carpenter </v>
<v Speaker 4>or what if you want to be a painter?</v>

1446
00:54:28.890 --> 00:54:30.000
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's so many.</v>

1447
00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:32.790
<v Speaker 4>For kids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the hardest thing is finding the thing,</v>

1448
00:54:33.180 --> 00:54:34.890
<v Speaker 4>finding whatever the fuck it is like you</v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

1449
00:54:34.891 --> 00:54:39.891
<v Speaker 4>most kids don't get enough exposure to </v>
<v Speaker 4>interesting ideas between the </v>

1450
00:54:39.891 --> 00:54:39.891
<v Speaker 4>schoolwork.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you,</v>

1451
00:54:39.891 --> 00:54:41.610
<v Speaker 4>when you go to school,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you think about what you gotta do,</v>

1452
00:54:41.611 --> 00:54:43.800
<v Speaker 4>you gotta get up at fucking 7:00</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the morning.</v>

1453
00:54:43.950 --> 00:54:46.010
<v Speaker 4>You've got to leave,</v>
<v Speaker 4>catch a bus with a bunch of other Douche</v>

1454
00:54:46.011 --> 00:54:48.360
<v Speaker 4>bags,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do a bunch of shit that sucks all day.</v>

1455
00:54:48.540 --> 00:54:50.760
<v Speaker 4>Listen to a bunch of people tell you </v>
<v Speaker 4>never going to make anything out of your</v>

1456
00:54:50.761 --> 00:54:52.710
<v Speaker 4>life unless you pay attention to them </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they're like,</v>

1457
00:54:52.711 --> 00:54:54.150
<v Speaker 4>listen bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're teaching school.</v>

1458
00:54:54.151 --> 00:54:55.740
<v Speaker 4>I know you don't make any money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shut the fuck up.</v>

1459
00:54:55.741 --> 00:55:00.420
<v Speaker 4>Don't you love how life is so great when</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're a kid like no the other moments,</v>

1460
00:55:00.421 --> 00:55:02.970
<v Speaker 4>but it sucked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So to find something that you truly love</v>

1461
00:55:02.971 --> 00:55:07.971
<v Speaker 4>in the midst of all this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like programming is what school is no </v>

1462
00:55:07.971 --> 00:55:08.790
<v Speaker 4>more than programming.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is education.</v>

1463
00:55:08.791 --> 00:55:10.800
<v Speaker 4>There is information that you're going </v>
<v Speaker 4>to download,</v>

1464
00:55:10.801 --> 00:55:13.770
<v Speaker 4>you're going to remember it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the reality of what it is is getting</v>

1465
00:55:13.771 --> 00:55:16.590
<v Speaker 4>you program to get used to doing things </v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't want to do.</v>

1466
00:55:16.770 --> 00:55:18.710
<v Speaker 4>Listening to people that you don't want </v>
<v Speaker 4>to hear,</v>

1467
00:55:18.750 --> 00:55:19.260
<v Speaker 4>you're around people.</v>

1468
00:55:19.260 --> 00:55:21.300
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to be around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a Buzzer,</v>

1469
00:55:21.330 --> 00:55:23.460
<v Speaker 4>but wide.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why does there have to be a buzzer?</v>

1470
00:55:23.461 --> 00:55:28.461
<v Speaker 4>Stupid?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is it so important that we fucking </v>

1471
00:55:28.461 --> 00:55:28.461
<v Speaker 4>leave at a certain time and get there at</v>
<v Speaker 4>a certain time?</v>

1472
00:55:28.461 --> 00:55:32.780
<v Speaker 4>You're turning me into a robot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know you're turning me into some </v>

1473
00:55:32.780 --> 00:55:33.810
<v Speaker 4>worker asshole that just goes and does </v>
<v Speaker 4>the same goddamn thing everyday.</v>

1474
00:55:33.880 --> 00:55:37.910
<v Speaker 4>Providing order for a certain mind that </v>
<v Speaker 4>might otherwise to just the devolvement.</v>

1475
00:55:37.911 --> 00:55:39.480
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's ways to educate people.</v>

1476
00:55:39.570 --> 00:55:44.570
<v Speaker 4>A little teasers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My favorite hobby is if I'm out with </v>

1477
00:55:44.570 --> 00:55:45.840
<v Speaker 4>friends and I was out in San Francisco </v>
<v Speaker 4>with a buddy and he had a date.</v>

<v Speaker 4>hour about.</v>

1482
00:55:54.340 --> 00:55:54.340
<v Speaker 4>My uncles were public school teachers.</v>

1483
00:55:54.340 --> 00:55:55.260
<v Speaker 4>They have horror stories.</v>

<v Speaker 4>huge,</v>

1486

<v Speaker 4>It's a horror story of well you know,</v>

<v Speaker 4>when I was 13.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That shit never took place.</v>

<v Speaker 4>They're all doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1499
00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:29.520
<v Speaker 5>going to do something and you never knew</v>
<v Speaker 5>quite what it was.</v>

1500
00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:33.871
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And there was this kind of like adult </v>

1501
00:56:33.871 --> 00:56:33.871
<v Speaker 5>conspiracy to keep like pornography or </v>
<v Speaker 5>away from you and things like that.</v>

1502
00:56:33.871 --> 00:56:34.360
<v Speaker 5>You had to go to the woods and find </v>
<v Speaker 5>porn.</v>

1503
00:56:34.361 --> 00:56:36.610
<v Speaker 5>We've talked about this 100 times on the</v>
<v Speaker 5>poc finding,</v>

1504

1507
00:56:49.140 --> 00:56:50.410
<v Speaker 5>the magazine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You shouldn't make an adult bookstore in</v>

1508
00:56:50.411 --> 00:56:52.020
<v Speaker 5>the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It'd probably be the most successful.</v>

<v Speaker 6>but I understand where that's coming </v>

1545
00:58:18.381 --> 00:58:18.381
<v Speaker 6>from.</v>
<v Speaker 6>These kids are going to be fine.</v>

1546
00:58:18.381 --> 00:58:18.381
<v Speaker 6>They're growing up with other humans</v>

1547
00:58:18.381 --> 00:58:23.050
<v Speaker 5>to some extent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You want them to make their own </v>

1548
00:58:23.050 --> 00:58:23.050
<v Speaker 5>mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

<v Speaker 6>you gotta be Careful.</v>

1555
00:58:28.860 --> 00:58:30.780
<v Speaker 6>You don't want them to be kids die,</v>

<v Speaker 6>the living room right now.</v>

<v Speaker 6>The point is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1562
00:58:42.690 --> 00:58:45.840
<v Speaker 6>what these,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're growing up with other people and</v>

1563
00:58:45.841 --> 00:58:49.380
<v Speaker 6>I think things always get better and </v>
<v Speaker 6>even though it seems like shit's worse,</v>

1564
00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:54.680
<v Speaker 6>even though it seems like shit's worse </v>
<v Speaker 6>as far as like the economy and all this </v>

1565
00:58:54.680 --> 00:58:55.740
<v Speaker 6>craziness as far as invasion of privacy </v>
<v Speaker 6>and you know,</v>

1566
00:58:55.741 --> 00:58:56.450
<v Speaker 6>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

1567
00:58:56.451 --> 00:59:01.451
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the access to information that we have </v>

1568
00:59:01.451 --> 00:59:01.500
<v Speaker 6>and they're getting inundated with </v>
<v Speaker 6>images and videos and all this shit that</v>

1569
00:59:01.501 --> 00:59:03.150
<v Speaker 6>we didn't see it until we were well </v>
<v Speaker 6>mature.</v>

1570
00:59:03.690 --> 00:59:05.100
<v Speaker 6>They're goIng to be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're just,</v>

1571
00:59:05.101 --> 00:59:06.990
<v Speaker 6>this is how they're grown up now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is just how it is.</v>

1572
00:59:06.991 --> 00:59:10.020
<v Speaker 6>And we're just the old people that are </v>
<v Speaker 6>just like our parents,</v>

1573
00:59:10.021 --> 00:59:10.480
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just what it is.</v>

1580
00:59:21.741 --> 00:59:22.040
<v Speaker 6>It's just</v>

1581
00:59:22.220 --> 00:59:27.220
<v Speaker 4>this is the new world and the world </v>
<v Speaker 4>constantly keeps getting more and more </v>

1582
00:59:27.220 --> 00:59:27.330
<v Speaker 4>complex world of estimates.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1583
00:59:27.650 --> 00:59:30.020
<v Speaker 4>the world is always getting more and </v>
<v Speaker 4>more fucked up.</v>

<v Speaker 4>the look.</v>

1586
00:59:36.290 --> 00:59:38.240

<v Speaker 4>information,</v>

1587
00:59:38.241 --> 00:59:43.241
<v Speaker 4>the way we were expressing each other </v>
<v Speaker 4>right now and communicating with each </v>

1588
00:59:43.241 --> 00:59:45.941
<v Speaker 4>other,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people are gonna be able to figure out </v>

1617
01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:39.700
<v Speaker 4>It must be magic.</v>

<v Speaker 4>knowledge,</v>

<v Speaker 4>alexandria burned down,</v>

1621
01:00:42.470 --> 01:00:43.320
<v Speaker 4>they had.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1622
01:00:43.330 --> 01:00:44.340
<v Speaker 4>that was the idea as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

1623
01:00:44.380 --> 01:00:49.380
<v Speaker 4>they kept all the knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>they had all this information about all </v>

1624
01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:49.940
<v Speaker 4>sorts of different things that the lay </v>
<v Speaker 4>person was unaware of.</v>

1625
01:00:50.070 --> 01:00:51.950
<v Speaker 4>So everybody can get it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Google bitch.</v>

1626
01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:57.040
<v Speaker 4>Damn you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We used to have to seek out a tim </v>

<v Speaker 4>sweeney,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eric john carmack and hang onto the and </v>

1628
01:00:58.961 --> 01:00:58.961

<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>

1629
01:00:58.961 --> 01:01:03.341
<v Speaker 4>Now there's just fucking computer </v>
<v Speaker 4>connection to the internet and all your </v>

1630
01:01:03.341 --> 01:01:04.280
<v Speaker 4>questions answered,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not always true to not.</v>

1631

<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the thing is,</v>

1632
01:01:05.180 --> 01:01:07.760
<v Speaker 4>but it's getting there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It really is getting closer and closer.</v>

1633
01:01:07.761 --> 01:01:10.250
<v Speaker 4>It's getting to the point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of misinformation,</v>

1634
01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:15.280
<v Speaker 4>but there's also a lot of information.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of good information and I </v>

1635
01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:18.581
<v Speaker 4>think that's good because I think it </v>
<v Speaker 4>developed just like we need to be able </v>

1636
01:01:18.581 --> 01:01:22.181
<v Speaker 4>to discern between bullshit and reality </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the real world need to be able to </v>

1637
01:01:22.181 --> 01:01:25.151
<v Speaker 4>discern between bullshit and reality </v>
<v Speaker 4>online and people will sort it all out </v>

1638
01:01:25.151 --> 01:01:25.151
<v Speaker 4>and figure it out.</v>

1639
01:01:25.151 --> 01:01:25.310
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you know,</v>

1640
01:01:25.340 --> 01:01:30.340
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of people that have it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of urban myths about all </v>

1641
01:01:30.340 --> 01:01:30.340
<v Speaker 4>sorts of different things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1645
01:01:33.681 --> 01:01:38.681
<v Speaker 4>how many different stories,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if we ever heard when they just go pop </v>

1646
01:01:38.681 --> 01:01:38.681
<v Speaker 4>rocks growing up.</v>

<v Speaker 4>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what it was.</v>

1648
01:01:39.550 --> 01:01:41.830
<v Speaker 4>It was mikey from the life cereal </v>
<v Speaker 4>commercial died.</v>

1649
01:01:41.831 --> 01:01:45.120
<v Speaker 4>His stomach explodes right when there </v>
<v Speaker 4>was the urban legend about the girl that</v>

1650
01:01:45.121 --> 01:01:47.570
<v Speaker 4>stuck the hotdog in her pussy and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>had to go to the hospital.</v>

1651
01:01:47.571 --> 01:01:48.740
<v Speaker 4>You never heard that one?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Didn't hear that one.</v>

1652
01:01:48.770 --> 01:01:51.320
<v Speaker 4>That was the other one there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All the maggots were starting coming out</v>

1653
01:01:51.321 --> 01:01:56.321
<v Speaker 4>of her ass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then there's the one about the </v>

<v Speaker 4>lobster that right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You heard that one rIght?</v>

1655
01:01:56.321 --> 01:01:56.321
<v Speaker 4>What was that one?</v>

1656
01:01:56.321 --> 01:02:01.260
<v Speaker 4>That girl apparently took less than one </v>
<v Speaker 4>lobster.</v>

1657
01:02:01.340 --> 01:02:06.340
<v Speaker 4>Put it in here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then like lit a match to it to make its </v>

1658
01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:06.340
<v Speaker 4>tail flip around and turns out the </v>
<v Speaker 4>lobster head,</v>

1659
01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:08.440
<v Speaker 4>like planted a bunch of eggs in her and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then three weeks later she died the tub.</v>

1660
01:02:08.490 --> 01:02:09.340
<v Speaker 4>IT's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1661
01:02:09.510 --> 01:02:11.830
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can certainly See thAt some disgusting</v>

1662
01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:13.490
<v Speaker 4>giRL wAs shit breath telling me that </v>
<v Speaker 4>story.</v>

1663
01:02:13.610 --> 01:02:18.610
<v Speaker 4>It really seems like life is going </v>
<v Speaker 4>towards like the having a matrix where </v>

1664
01:02:18.610 --> 01:02:23.080
<v Speaker 4>you live a bubble and your whole life is</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you're in suCh a harsh.</v>

1665
01:02:23.150 --> 01:02:25.590
<v Speaker 4>She took this lab staff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's stalking and helpless here.</v>

1666
01:02:25.670 --> 01:02:27.000
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1667
01:02:29.210 --> 01:02:33.270
<v Speaker 4>And it was fuCking lobster traps all his</v>
<v Speaker 4>eggs in a snatch.</v>

1668
01:02:33.271 --> 01:02:36.600
<v Speaker 4>It was a lobster fest until fucking labs</v>
<v Speaker 4>is a crime and I have a pussy.</v>

1669
01:02:36.610 --> 01:02:41.610
<v Speaker 4>What a whore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Think that's the case that that life is </v>

1670
01:02:41.610 --> 01:02:45.081
<v Speaker 4>going towards where we're going to be in</v>
<v Speaker 4>a bubble in our whole life is going to </v>

1671
01:02:45.081 --> 01:02:48.351
<v Speaker 4>be some kind of like matrix style cocoon</v>
<v Speaker 4>where we're all working for the people </v>

1672
01:02:48.351 --> 01:02:50.790
<v Speaker 4>who actually have people skills will </v>
<v Speaker 4>suddenly,</v>

1673
01:02:50.791 --> 01:02:52.710
<v Speaker 4>everybody's to know how to be connected </v>
<v Speaker 4>and how to get all this data.</v>

1674
01:02:52.711 --> 01:02:53.370
<v Speaker 4>RIght.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But those,</v>

1675
01:02:53.371 --> 01:02:58.371
<v Speaker 4>you actually can interact in real life </v>
<v Speaker 4>will actually do pretty well if you've </v>

1676
01:02:58.371 --> 01:03:01.151
<v Speaker 4>got a combination of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's interesting to try to speculate as </v>

1677
01:03:01.151 --> 01:03:05.991
<v Speaker 4>to what exactly was going to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we all know that something's </v>

1678
01:03:05.991 --> 01:03:08.391
<v Speaker 4>happening and that's the most </v>
<v Speaker 4>interesting thing about this </v>

1679
01:03:08.391 --> 01:03:10.221
<v Speaker 4>conversation is that we all are just </v>
<v Speaker 4>admitting like everyone's saying is no </v>

1680
01:03:10.221 --> 01:03:10.230
<v Speaker 4>one saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1681
01:03:10.231 --> 01:03:12.810
<v Speaker 4>this is going to stop and everything </v>
<v Speaker 4>will level off and then we'll just,</v>

1682
01:03:12.811 --> 01:03:13.680
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go fishing,</v>

1683
01:03:14.170 --> 01:03:16.440
<v Speaker 4>go faster than ever though </v>
<v Speaker 4>exponentially.</v>

1684
01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:16.800
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1685
01:03:16.801 --> 01:03:20.460
<v Speaker 4>It's moving in a weird direction when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you were talking about that smart dust,</v>

1686
01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:21.450
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

1687
01:03:21.470 --> 01:03:26.470
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ability to track you and little </v>

1688
01:03:26.470 --> 01:03:28.581
<v Speaker 4>particles that can hang on to you and </v>
<v Speaker 4>three d computers and this whole wiki </v>

1689
01:03:28.581 --> 01:03:28.581
<v Speaker 4>leaks thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1690
01:03:28.581 --> 01:03:32.550
<v Speaker 4>what would the transparency of the whole</v>
<v Speaker 4>process now seeing this guy get arrested</v>

1691
01:03:32.551 --> 01:03:36.270
<v Speaker 4>for not wearing a condom and there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>tracking him down like he's a killer and</v>

1692
01:03:36.271 --> 01:03:38.790
<v Speaker 4>that is the main thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's done wrong.</v>

1693
01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:40.470
<v Speaker 4>He didn't wear a condom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody knows.</v>

1694
01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:42.390
<v Speaker 4>Nobody knows anybody else involved that </v>
<v Speaker 4>though,</v>

1695
01:03:42.391 --> 01:03:44.280
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1696
01:03:44.281 --> 01:03:46.470
<v Speaker 4>up there and take it on the chin as the </v>
<v Speaker 4>face of this whole operation.</v>

1697
01:03:46.471 --> 01:03:51.471
<v Speaker 4>I don't understand the whole story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I need to look into it more and I </v>

1698
01:03:51.471 --> 01:03:53.070
<v Speaker 4>hesitate to say anytime anything </v>
<v Speaker 4>involves anything political,</v>

1699
01:03:53.071 --> 01:03:58.071
<v Speaker 4>I always just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what it's like watching a tv </v>

1716
01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:30.620
<v Speaker 4>nations are going to know what kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>shit we talked about them.</v>

1717
01:04:30.750 --> 01:04:32.340
<v Speaker 4>You have a hard time containing data </v>
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>

1718
01:04:32.341 --> 01:04:33.720
<v Speaker 4>Even in my business,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just like,</v>

1719
01:04:33.721 --> 01:04:38.721
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>suddenly something just appears as a </v>

1720
01:04:38.721 --> 01:04:38.721
<v Speaker 4>rumor on a website.</v>

1721
01:04:38.721 --> 01:04:38.721
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how the fuck it is amazing.</v>

1722
01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:43.760
<v Speaker 4>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's somebody's profitinG by this </v>

1723
01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:43.760
<v Speaker 4>because I know in the gaming industry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're going to leak something too,</v>

1724
01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:48.201
<v Speaker 4>like you know a video game website,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not going to make money and hope </v>

1725
01:04:48.201 --> 01:04:50.560
<v Speaker 4>somebody wouldn't have two beers at a </v>
<v Speaker 4>pub and tell him something like that.</v>

1726
01:04:50.570 --> 01:04:52.160
<v Speaker 4>It's people run with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1727
01:04:52.170 --> 01:04:57.170
<v Speaker 4>That's one of the most fascinating </v>
<v Speaker 4>things about bit torrents and all this </v>

1728
01:04:57.170 --> 01:04:59.691
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's almost like people feel compelled </v>

1729
01:04:59.691 --> 01:04:59.691
<v Speaker 4>to contribute.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like there's a,</v>

1730
01:04:59.691 --> 01:05:04.300
<v Speaker 4>there's a like a human urge to put </v>
<v Speaker 4>information and stuff available online.</v>

1731
01:05:04.590 --> 01:05:06.360
<v Speaker 4>Like before people were getting chased </v>
<v Speaker 4>down.</v>

1732
01:05:06.510 --> 01:05:10.200
<v Speaker 4>People love the idea that you could go </v>
<v Speaker 4>to their site and get a bunch of shit.</v>

1733
01:05:10.260 --> 01:05:15.260

<v Speaker 4>There were so many</v>

1738
01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:23.010
<v Speaker 5>different sites that had illegal shit </v>
<v Speaker 5>and there's got to be like a human </v>

1739
01:05:23.010 --> 01:05:26.161
<v Speaker 5>nature thing where you just want to like</v>
<v Speaker 5>share and host and have community and </v>

1740
01:05:26.161 --> 01:05:26.161
<v Speaker 5>remember where's,</v>

<v Speaker 5>don't people don't know that there was </v>
<v Speaker 5>these weird fucking hidden sites.</v>

1743
01:05:31.931 --> 01:05:34.300
<v Speaker 5>We can go and download yours with z.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 5>W a r you go and Mexico suarez and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>got all shut down.</v>

1745
01:05:38.020 --> 01:05:39.640
<v Speaker 5>They've and figured out how to stop </v>
<v Speaker 5>them,</v>

1746
01:05:39.790 --> 01:05:44.790
<v Speaker 5>but then this whole peer to peer thing </v>
<v Speaker 5>came up and the peer to peer thing is </v>

1747
01:05:44.790 --> 01:05:45.910
<v Speaker 5>too confusing for people don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like when you were downloading,</v>

1748
01:05:45.911 --> 01:05:48.400
<v Speaker 5>so if you're getting a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're not getting it from one person.</v>

1749
01:05:48.580 --> 01:05:51.520
<v Speaker 5>You're getting it from like 100 people </v>
<v Speaker 5>or more even.</v>

1750
01:05:51.730 --> 01:05:56.730
<v Speaker 5>You're getting all these files and </v>
<v Speaker 5>somehoW or another they're compiling </v>

1751
01:05:56.730 --> 01:05:56.730
<v Speaker 5>your computer.</v>

1752
01:05:56.730 --> 01:05:58.600
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's craziness because you're taking</v>

1753
01:05:58.601 --> 01:06:03.601
<v Speaker 5>all these ones and zeros from like 30 </v>
<v Speaker 5>different places and then the final </v>

1754
01:06:03.601 --> 01:06:03.840
<v Speaker 5>product is illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1755
01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:04.510
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whoa,</v>

1756
01:06:04.511 --> 01:06:05.680
<v Speaker 5>what are you saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How do you,</v>

1757
01:06:05.681 --> 01:06:06.410
<v Speaker 5>how do you track?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1758
01:06:06.460 --> 01:06:08.200
<v Speaker 5>Where did it come from?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Somebody had it.</v>

1759
01:06:08.410 --> 01:06:11.450
<v Speaker 5>If the one person that had it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's one illegal copy,</v>

1760
01:06:11.451 --> 01:06:12.700
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then they're all illegal.</v>

1761
01:06:12.701 --> 01:06:17.701
<v Speaker 5>but what if there's one legal?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So here's the key is to provide a </v>

1762
01:06:17.701 --> 01:06:17.701
<v Speaker 5>service that people are willing to pay </v>
<v Speaker 5>for.</v>

1763
01:06:17.701 --> 01:06:19.330
<v Speaker 5>Why do you think hollywood's betting on </v>
<v Speaker 5>three d so much right now?</v>

1764
01:06:19.510 --> 01:06:20.020
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

<v Speaker 5>that's adding a third dimension and the </v>

1767
01:06:26.150 --> 01:06:26.780
<v Speaker 5>key to that as nfl,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it's porn and I fell.</v>

1770

<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then it's an event,</v>

1771
01:06:32.231 --> 01:06:33.910
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>like filmed a bunch of them already.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I want,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want my three d to be an event.</v>

1773
01:06:35.471 --> 01:06:37.920
<v Speaker 5>I want to go see avatar,</v>
<v Speaker 5>toronto and three d.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I don't really care.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1776
01:06:41.570 --> 01:06:42.820
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In my house,</v>

1777
01:06:42.821 --> 01:06:44.500
<v Speaker 5>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't really need to see like,</v>

1778
01:06:44.501 --> 01:06:45.610
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your average rental in three d,</v>

1779
01:06:45.611 --> 01:06:47.230
<v Speaker 5>but when there's an event,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a fight,</v>

1780
01:06:47.231 --> 01:06:49.090
<v Speaker 5>there's a superbowl.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I will,</v>

1781
01:06:49.091 --> 01:06:51.430
<v Speaker 5>I'll put mY glasses on to watch that </v>
<v Speaker 5>movie.</v>

1782
01:06:51.490 --> 01:06:55.550
<v Speaker 5>Something fucking super like the more I </v>
<v Speaker 5>watched you.</v>

<v Speaker 5>The more watch tv in three d though.</v>

1784
01:06:58.151 --> 01:07:03.151
<v Speaker 5>It's not really about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think why they're trying to make all </v>

1785
01:07:03.151 --> 01:07:03.190
<v Speaker 5>the movies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>three ds and all the games.</v>

1786
01:07:03.191 --> 01:07:08.191
<v Speaker 5>Three d is to make it to the point that </v>
<v Speaker 5>what we're going towards is like walls </v>

1787
01:07:08.191 --> 01:07:12.361
<v Speaker 5>of tvs or like I was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the imax movie theater where it's going </v>

1788
01:07:12.361 --> 01:07:12.361
<v Speaker 5>to be the bubble,</v>
<v Speaker 5>aren't you?</v>

1789
01:07:12.361 --> 01:07:13.470
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the three 60,</v>

1790
01:07:13.471 --> 01:07:16.450
<v Speaker 5>like I think they're really trying to </v>
<v Speaker 5>push that,</v>

1791
01:07:16.451 --> 01:07:19.600
<v Speaker 5>that not the three d part,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just the depth part of it.</v>

1792
01:07:19.601 --> 01:07:22.180
<v Speaker 5>So that's what it's going towards.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A bigger screen.</v>

1793
01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:24.850
<v Speaker 5>Do you think that they can do that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Eventually there'll be able to create an</v>

1794
01:07:24.851 --> 01:07:29.851
<v Speaker 5>image that looks three dimensional </v>
<v Speaker 5>without actually having to have glasses </v>

1795
01:07:29.851 --> 01:07:29.851
<v Speaker 5>and you see the nintendo three ds?</v>

<v Speaker 5>most original thing,</v>

1814
01:08:05.711 --> 01:08:08.380
<v Speaker 5>but if you can provide something silver </v>

01:08:36.041 --> 01:08:39.371
<v Speaker 5>going down,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're pulling out something like a </v>

1829
01:08:39.371 --> 01:08:39.560
<v Speaker 5>dead body or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Long hallway,</v>

1830
01:08:39.900 --> 01:08:41.300
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what it seems like.</v>

1831
01:08:41.301 --> 01:08:46.301
<v Speaker 5>Everything that I've been watching </v>
<v Speaker 5>regular tv in bed for like a couple </v>

1832
01:08:46.301 --> 01:08:47.780
<v Speaker 5>months now and even like regular tv </v>
<v Speaker 5>shows that,</v>

1833
01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:52.160
<v Speaker 5>that they have like a reaction that </v>
<v Speaker 5>makes the tv try to make it in three d,</v>

1834
01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:57.080
<v Speaker 5>that reenactment recreation of trying to</v>
<v Speaker 5>make it three and even shows like that.</v>

1835
01:08:57.081 --> 01:08:58.700
<v Speaker 5>You're just watching tv and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

1836
01:08:58.701 --> 01:09:01.430
<v Speaker 5>this background is really far back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1837
01:09:01.460 --> 01:09:06.460
<v Speaker 5>so it seems like everything is going for</v>
<v Speaker 5>depth nowadays that the technology is </v>

1838
01:09:06.460 --> 01:09:11.081
<v Speaker 5>going to be like us in a pod and we're </v>
<v Speaker 5>just going to sit there and get </v>

1839
01:09:11.081 --> 01:09:11.081
<v Speaker 5>communicated back.</v>

1840
01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:13.550
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what it seems like we used to the</v>

1841
01:09:13.580 --> 01:09:14.840
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That they can't go back.</v>

1842
01:09:15.110 --> 01:09:16.940
<v Speaker 5>So it is with hd are familiar right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1843
01:09:16.941 --> 01:09:21.941
<v Speaker 5>But never underestimate how many people </v>
<v Speaker 5>don't have the money or the upgraded </v>

1844
01:09:21.941 --> 01:09:22.040
<v Speaker 5>conversation I ever said.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sorry.</v>

1845
01:09:22.220 --> 01:09:23.610
<v Speaker 5>We don't like we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>

1846
01:09:23.630 --> 01:09:26.210
<v Speaker 5>we can track how many people have hd </v>
<v Speaker 5>versus standard definition,</v>

1847
01:09:26.211 --> 01:09:28.060
<v Speaker 5>televisions and games.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1848
01:09:28.070 --> 01:09:33.070
<v Speaker 5>Based on their settings.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's actually not as many people as </v>

1849
01:09:33.070 --> 01:09:36.221
<v Speaker 5>you think have hdtv still to this day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they still have a great percentage of </v>

1850
01:09:36.221 --> 01:09:36.500
<v Speaker 5>rural America that's still doesn't have </v>
<v Speaker 5>broadband.</v>

1851
01:09:36.950 --> 01:09:41.950
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's so many people that lag behind </v>

1852
01:09:41.950 --> 01:09:41.950
<v Speaker 5>it because it's just not a priority for </v>
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

1853
01:09:41.950 --> 01:09:41.950
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You'll always get your early adopters.</v>

1854
01:09:41.950 --> 01:09:44.240
<v Speaker 5>You guys like you who have 3d.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's still tons of people out there.</v>

1855
01:09:44.241 --> 01:09:47.610
<v Speaker 5>Like I stream all my stuff on my xbox,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like when I saw the red box,</v>

1856
01:09:47.611 --> 01:09:49.160
<v Speaker 5>you go to the supermarket,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're out where I live,</v>

1857
01:09:49.161 --> 01:09:54.161
<v Speaker 5>and like a friday night or the college,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a line out the door at the for </v>

1858
01:09:54.161 --> 01:09:54.161
<v Speaker 5>the red box.</v>

1859
01:09:54.161 --> 01:09:54.161
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what is this?</v>

1860
01:09:54.161 --> 01:09:54.950
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just,</v>

1861
01:09:54.951 --> 01:09:59.951
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's blockbuster condensed into one box </v>

1862
01:09:59.951 --> 01:09:59.951
<v Speaker 5>that you just read.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1863
01:09:59.951 --> 01:10:03.221
<v Speaker 5>And it's huge.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not everybody has the broadband and has </v>

1864
01:10:03.221 --> 01:10:06.371
<v Speaker 5>an xbox set up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They can easily stream everything from </v>

1865
01:10:06.371 --> 01:10:06.371
<v Speaker 5>the comfort of their living room.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1866
01:10:06.371 --> 01:10:06.680
<v Speaker 5>But not everybody had electricity 200 </v>
<v Speaker 5>years ago.</v>

1867
01:10:06.780 --> 01:10:08.180
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's like it's all,</v>

1868
01:10:08.210 --> 01:10:09.440
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we got to keep pushing forward.</v>

1869
01:10:09.450 --> 01:10:12.290
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So going to eventually going in the same</v>

1870
01:10:12.291 --> 01:10:17.291
<v Speaker 5>direction.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't matter how many of these </v>

1871
01:10:17.291 --> 01:10:17.420
<v Speaker 5>hillbilly fucks don't catch up with no </v>
<v Speaker 5>broadband in 2010.</v>

1872
01:10:17.421 --> 01:10:20.900
<v Speaker 5>I got no fucking time for you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you need to move stupid.</v>

1873
01:10:21.330 --> 01:10:24.020
<v Speaker 5>You know you need to fucking get your </v>
<v Speaker 5>family out of the woods soon.</v>

1874
01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:29.500
<v Speaker 5>Come on buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like there's not going to be </v>

1875
01:10:29.500 --> 01:10:30.941
<v Speaker 5>carpenters anymore though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It seems like you were saying like if </v>

1876
01:10:30.941 --> 01:10:33.671
<v Speaker 5>you want to be a carpenter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like how is this person going to find </v>

1877
01:10:33.671 --> 01:10:33.671
<v Speaker 5>like a his job and stuff?</v>

1878
01:10:33.671 --> 01:10:35.360
<v Speaker 5>That's what's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's not going to be houses anymore.</v>

1879
01:10:35.361 --> 01:10:40.361
<v Speaker 5>We're going to live in pods.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Where will we have gigantic three d </v>

1880
01:10:40.361 --> 01:10:43.580
<v Speaker 5>computers or three d printers that we </v>
<v Speaker 5>set up that build a house?</v>

1881
01:10:43.581 --> 01:10:44.900
<v Speaker 5>Is that what it will be?</v>
<v Speaker 5>There'll be something.</v>

1882
01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:50.080
<v Speaker 5>It'd be like a cocoon of a third </v>
<v Speaker 5>dimension wall that wraps around your </v>

1883
01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:50.470
<v Speaker 5>body.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't want to live like that.</v>

1884
01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:52.760
<v Speaker 5>You're not going to be able to live a </v>
<v Speaker 5>bomber style,</v>

1885
01:10:53.350 --> 01:10:54.940
<v Speaker 5>but what if you're young and you grew up</v>
<v Speaker 5>with that?</v>

1886
01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:59.960
<v Speaker 5>You don't need that much space and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>prefer the virtual world over the real </v>

1887
01:10:59.960 --> 01:10:59.960
<v Speaker 5>world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>

1888
01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:03.161
<v Speaker 5>and you're.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're perfectly comfortable running </v>

1889
01:11:03.161 --> 01:11:03.470
<v Speaker 5>around a virtual field for a real one </v>
<v Speaker 5>and wouldn't be going to be inevitable.</v>

1890
01:11:03.530 --> 01:11:08.530
<v Speaker 5>Maybe it will be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Get so dope that why would you want to </v>

1891
01:11:08.530 --> 01:11:08.530
<v Speaker 5>live in the real world?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Stupid.</v>

1892
01:11:08.530 --> 01:11:11.020
<v Speaker 5>Maybe the the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the fake world will be so talked about.</v>

1893
01:11:11.900 --> 01:11:14.120
<v Speaker 5>What if you could just go and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>remember when</v>

1894
01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:19.120
<v Speaker 6>her virtual reality was all the rage in </v>
<v Speaker 6>the noodles with a giant dick and and </v>

1895
01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:23.331
<v Speaker 6>eyes that can see through walls and </v>
<v Speaker 6>there's no racists and racism and </v>

1896
01:11:23.331 --> 01:11:25.050
<v Speaker 6>perhaps some money that has ever been </v>
<v Speaker 6>printed.</v>

1897
01:11:25.051 --> 01:11:26.610
<v Speaker 6>It's all yours.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No penis.</v>

1898
01:11:26.611 --> 01:11:29.880
<v Speaker 6>We all have faulty penises and you can </v>
<v Speaker 6>just go to other world.</v>

1899
01:11:29.881 --> 01:11:31.560
<v Speaker 6>You can travel to other worlds.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can do anything.</v>

1900
01:11:31.561 --> 01:11:33.210
<v Speaker 6>It's not real.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We can make it their own world,</v>

1901
01:11:33.211 --> 01:11:35.680
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the million dollar per billion to</v>

1902
01:11:35.681 --> 01:11:37.340
<v Speaker 6>a trillion dollar prize.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Everybody wants to go for,</v>

1903
01:11:37.341 --> 01:11:39.540
<v Speaker 6>for games to give you that your dream </v>
<v Speaker 6>that you can ultimately control.</v>

1904
01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:40.920
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>let's think about this man.</v>

1905
01:11:40.950 --> 01:11:42.420
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what is imagination?</v>

1906
01:11:42.421 --> 01:11:47.421
<v Speaker 6>Imagination is some sort of energy that </v>
<v Speaker 6>allows you to think up something that </v>

1907
01:11:47.421 --> 01:11:49.440
<v Speaker 6>isn't there and create it and now it </v>
<v Speaker 6>becomes real.</v>

1908
01:11:49.441 --> 01:11:52.500
<v Speaker 6>It manifests itself in the real three </v>
<v Speaker 6>dimensional world and you can beat on it</v>

1909
01:11:52.501 --> 01:11:52.980
<v Speaker 6>with a hammer.</v>

1910
01:11:53.010 --> 01:11:58.010
<v Speaker 6>It all comes from imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So imagination is like some real </v>

1911
01:11:58.010 --> 01:12:01.821
<v Speaker 6>creating force were,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but nobody really ever knows where that </v>

1912
01:12:01.821 --> 01:12:04.371
<v Speaker 6>comes from.</v>
<v Speaker 6>is it coming to your environment is </v>

1913
01:12:04.371 --> 01:12:04.371
<v Speaker 6>coming from like what you're exposed to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like what is it?</v>

1914
01:12:04.371 --> 01:12:08.040
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they also the concept of the muse that </v>

1915
01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:08.520
<v Speaker 6>the urine antenna and that you're tuning</v>
<v Speaker 6>into all the energy that's out there and</v>

1916
01:12:08.521 --> 01:12:09.270
<v Speaker 6>I'll just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1917
01:12:09.271 --> 01:12:11.700
<v Speaker 6>you just sort of some sort of another </v>
<v Speaker 6>process.</v>

1918
01:12:11.701 --> 01:12:12.650
<v Speaker 6>it just like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1919
01:12:12.651 --> 01:12:16.110
<v Speaker 6>like a satellite dish pulls it out of </v>
<v Speaker 6>the sky and makes these numbers ones and</v>

1920
01:12:16.111 --> 01:12:18.150
<v Speaker 6>zeros and do this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But it's true.</v>

1921
01:12:18.330 --> 01:12:20.700
<v Speaker 6>I mean when you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when you Look at what imagination is,</v>

1922
01:12:20.701 --> 01:12:22.890
<v Speaker 6>I mean it really is some sort of an </v>
<v Speaker 6>energy,</v>

1923
01:12:22.891 --> 01:12:26.640
<v Speaker 6>something that exists in the mind and </v>
<v Speaker 6>that it's ether role and then it becomes</v>

1924
01:12:26.641 --> 01:12:28.320
<v Speaker 6>a solid thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It becomes a miller lite,</v>

1925
01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:29.670
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>becomes a computer,</v>

1926
01:12:29.671 --> 01:12:31.260
<v Speaker 6>it becomes a microphone,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1927
01:12:31.261 --> 01:12:36.261
<v Speaker 6>and this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>all this is eventually got to move </v>

1928
01:12:36.261 --> 01:12:36.261
<v Speaker 6>further.</v>

1929
01:12:36.261 --> 01:12:37.410
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>So if,</v>

1930
01:12:37.590 --> 01:12:42.590
<v Speaker 6>if the imagination of all these thoughts</v>
<v Speaker 6>can become a real thing by someone </v>

1931
01:12:42.590 --> 01:12:44.340
<v Speaker 6>getting out and and sawing some wood and</v>
<v Speaker 6>nailing some things together,</v>

1932
01:12:44.580 --> 01:12:49.580
<v Speaker 6>eventually it's going to become </v>
<v Speaker 6>something through code where you can </v>

1933
01:12:49.580 --> 01:12:50.430
<v Speaker 6>alter things not with a hammer and </v>
<v Speaker 6>nails,</v>

1934
01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:55.640
<v Speaker 6>but you can use your mind to create a </v>
<v Speaker 6>real world that could be 100 percent </v>

1935
01:12:56.131 --> 01:13:01.131
<v Speaker 6>real with your imagination applied </v>
<v Speaker 6>operating system that tunes into neural </v>

1936
01:13:01.131 --> 01:13:05.721
<v Speaker 6>interface and becomes a part of you and </v>
<v Speaker 6>you and this operating system connect to</v>

1937
01:13:06.061 --> 01:13:08.670
<v Speaker 6>some sort of a computer or whatever the </v>
<v Speaker 6>fuck it is,</v>

1938
01:13:08.671 --> 01:13:13.671
<v Speaker 6>whether it's wireless or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then all of a sudden you enter into </v>

1939
01:13:13.671 --> 01:13:15.810
<v Speaker 6>a tangible third dimensional three </v>
<v Speaker 6>dimensional world that you control.</v>

1940
01:13:16.140 --> 01:13:18.780
<v Speaker 6>Then you upload it into it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What the fuck man?</v>

1941
01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:21.510
<v Speaker 6>And we leave meetspace right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Space,</v>

1942
01:13:21.580 --> 01:13:26.580
<v Speaker 6>but think about what happens when the </v>
<v Speaker 6>meat dies and he's just rot and then </v>

1943
01:13:26.580 --> 01:13:26.580
<v Speaker 6>someone has to come along and clean you.</v>

1944
01:13:26.580 --> 01:13:28.560
<v Speaker 6>They have to recognize as a whole in the</v>
<v Speaker 6>matrix and see you fight it weird.</v>

1945
01:13:28.561 --> 01:13:31.830
<v Speaker 6>That is 2010 and we still bury people in</v>
<v Speaker 6>the ground scam.</v>

1946
01:13:32.570 --> 01:13:37.570
<v Speaker 6>We should address those people up and </v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking dancing around like we need to </v>

1997
01:15:24.940 --> 01:15:28.831
<v Speaker 5>responding though,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's not like there's a twilight </v>

1998

<v Speaker 5>zone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1999
01:15:28.831 --> 01:15:32.130
<v Speaker 5>It starts with the poke right button and</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>

2000
01:15:32.861 --> 01:15:37.861
<v Speaker 5>I think the assence kicking in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's this article in fast company </v>

2001
01:15:37.861 --> 01:15:40.921
<v Speaker 5>talkIng about how twitter is kind of </v>
<v Speaker 5>taken over in certain ways and how </v>

2002
01:15:40.921 --> 01:15:41.740
<v Speaker 5>basically during the maze this year they</v>
<v Speaker 5>had like twitter projections on the wall</v>

2003
01:15:41.741 --> 01:15:44.590
<v Speaker 5>of like the number of hits like each </v>
<v Speaker 5>artist got and there had life youth,</v>

2004
01:15:44.591 --> 01:15:46.700
<v Speaker 5>what people are saying about each artist</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so we're.</v>

2005
01:15:46.700 --> 01:15:49.450
<v Speaker 5>We have a generation right now that </v>
<v Speaker 5>wants to interact 24 slash seven.</v>

2006
01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:52.720
<v Speaker 5>it started with the remote control and </v>
<v Speaker 5>now like it's not enough.</v>

2007
01:15:52.721 --> 01:15:57.721
<v Speaker 5>I know friends who've been sitting there</v>
<v Speaker 5>texting other people and I'll say </v>

2008
01:15:57.721 --> 01:15:57.721
<v Speaker 5>something like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

2009
01:15:57.721 --> 01:15:58.150
<v Speaker 5>do you wanna go to the you wanna go to </v>
<v Speaker 5>the store and they'll be like,</v>

2010
01:15:58.151 --> 01:15:59.530
<v Speaker 5>did you actually hear what I what I just</v>
<v Speaker 5>said?</v>

2011
01:15:59.531 --> 01:16:00.310
<v Speaker 5>And they'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2012
01:16:00.311 --> 01:16:05.311
<v Speaker 5>you said you wanna go to the store while</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're in the middle of typing an </v>

2013
01:16:05.311 --> 01:16:07.171
<v Speaker 5>email.</v>
<v Speaker 5>the human mind is adapting to this kind </v>

2014
01:16:07.171 --> 01:16:09.781
<v Speaker 5>of multitask ability.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not just enough to sit down and </v>

2015
01:16:09.781 --> 01:16:09.781
<v Speaker 5>watch something you need to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You need to a her feet,</v>

2016
01:16:09.781 --> 01:16:14.031
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're playing an online game and in </v>

2017
01:16:14.031 --> 01:16:14.031
<v Speaker 5>between rounds were tweeting at the same</v>
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>

2018
01:16:14.031 --> 01:16:17.641
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have to keep doing something and </v>

2019
01:16:17.641 --> 01:16:17.641
<v Speaker 5>doing multiple things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Otherwise the brain is bored.</v>

2020
01:16:17.641 --> 01:16:18.550
<v Speaker 5>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it affects traffic as much</v>

2021
01:16:18.580 --> 01:16:21.780
<v Speaker 5>either because I think the majority of </v>
<v Speaker 5>people that have like the,</v>

2022
01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:22.470
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2023
01:16:22.750 --> 01:16:27.750
<v Speaker 5>the google maps,</v>
<v Speaker 5>live traffic view sorts that out from </v>

2024
01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:29.440
<v Speaker 5>people that are just sitting there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>twittering our mom and driving slower.</v>

2025
01:16:29.460 --> 01:16:33.010
<v Speaker 5>Like it cancels each other out because </v>
<v Speaker 5>now we have better technology so we know</v>

2026
01:16:33.011 --> 01:16:35.230
<v Speaker 5>where to drive better and where the </v>
<v Speaker 5>traffic is.</v>

2027
01:16:35.410 --> 01:16:40.410
<v Speaker 5>So that equals out the other retards,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they just sitting there twittering and </v>

2028
01:16:40.410 --> 01:16:41.800
<v Speaker 5>slowing down traffic at different way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So what do you think about that?</v>

2029
01:16:42.770 --> 01:16:47.770
<v Speaker 5>Your steering wheel with a shit about </v>
<v Speaker 5>your phone to the center of your </v>

<v Speaker 5>you could feel the tug of your phone in </v>
<v Speaker 5>your pocket sometimes.</v>

2035
01:16:56.420 --> 01:16:57.700
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

2121
01:20:16.870 --> 01:20:20.300

<v Speaker 1>like a show on the show and that's what </v>

2123
01:20:25.301 --> 01:20:25.680
<v Speaker 1>made me got into thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

01:20:25.681 --> 01:20:27.870
<v Speaker 1>he is,</v>

<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>

2127
01:20:31.741 --> 01:20:34.350
<v Speaker 1>but he's working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's out there constantly huffing it.</v>

2128
01:20:34.410 --> 01:20:36.260
<v Speaker 1>I heard he did like three hours shows </v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

2129
01:20:36.300 --> 01:20:38.660
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just as ridiculous shows.</v>

2130
01:20:38.670 --> 01:20:40.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to know is like stealing a lot of</v>

2131
01:20:40.501 --> 01:20:41.040
<v Speaker 1>comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2132
01:20:41.041 --> 01:20:46.041
<v Speaker 1>He's doing a constantly his feet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so his feet must hurt that they must </v>

2133
01:20:46.041 --> 01:20:46.041
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They must just fucking anybody sits down</v>

2134
01:20:46.041 --> 01:20:46.041
<v Speaker 1>after awhile.</v>

2135
01:20:46.110 --> 01:20:49.260
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it lays down and it maybe what he </v>
<v Speaker 1>does this,</v>

2136
01:20:49.590 --> 01:20:54.590
<v Speaker 1>the audience is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like one of those amusement park </v>

2137
01:20:54.590 --> 01:20:56.961
<v Speaker 1>rides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all strap in and they're raised </v>

2138
01:20:56.961 --> 01:20:58.991
<v Speaker 1>them up over him so they're hanging from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ceiling and he's lying on his back </v>

2139
01:20:58.991 --> 01:21:02.361
<v Speaker 1>and that's what he does is common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what if he had a waterbed onstage </v>

2140
01:21:02.361 --> 01:21:03.660
<v Speaker 1>and just laid back in a wider bed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there was this candles all around them.</v>

2141
01:21:03.661 --> 01:21:05.410
<v Speaker 1>And then that's how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how I did his whole show.</v>

2142
01:21:06.190 --> 01:21:09.360
<v Speaker 1>Cool fucking idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about just being in the tub?</v>

2143
01:21:09.460 --> 01:21:12.540
<v Speaker 1>Just in the tub with candles comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh totally.</v>

2144
01:21:12.541 --> 01:21:17.541
<v Speaker 1>That's actually not a bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had your opener in there with you </v>

2145
01:21:17.541 --> 01:21:18.340
<v Speaker 1>and they're just hanging out laying </v>
<v Speaker 1>there girls though.</v>

2146
01:21:18.550 --> 01:21:23.550
<v Speaker 1>You only had one person who's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One person who lives you in that camp </v>

2147
01:21:24.181 --> 01:21:27.930
<v Speaker 1>that thinks girls aren't funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most giRls are not fun comedy thing,</v>

2148
01:21:27.931 --> 01:21:32.931
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a bunch mean sarah </v>

2149
01:21:32.931 --> 01:21:32.931
<v Speaker 1>silvermans reallY funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I shouldn't say most girls,</v>

2150
01:21:32.931 --> 01:21:34.080
<v Speaker 1>just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most comics are funny either.</v>

2151
01:21:34.081 --> 01:21:38.380
<v Speaker 1>There's less girls doing comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's that funny</v>

2152
01:21:38.510 --> 01:21:41.370
<v Speaker 6>comedians that are women.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean there's no asterisks.</v>

2153
01:21:41.371 --> 01:21:43.100
<v Speaker 6>FunnY little esther.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She's very funny.</v>

2154
01:21:43.101 --> 01:21:48.101
<v Speaker 6>She's a good comic.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a bunch that are really good </v>

2155
01:21:48.101 --> 01:21:50.201
<v Speaker 6>comics.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm gonna have a bunch of friends that </v>

2156
01:21:50.201 --> 01:21:50.201
<v Speaker 6>are comics that are female.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a joke.</v>

2157
01:21:50.201 --> 01:21:53.590
<v Speaker 6>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's a lot of women that are </v>

2158
01:21:53.590 --> 01:21:55.271
<v Speaker 6>terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a different to have different </v>

2159
01:21:55.271 --> 01:21:58.271
<v Speaker 6>restrictions.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They can't talk about as many things </v>

2160
01:21:58.271 --> 01:21:58.271
<v Speaker 6>that can't leave.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sarah silverman does,</v>

2161
01:21:58.271 --> 01:21:58.970
<v Speaker 6>but she's such a rarity,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2162
01:21:58.971 --> 01:22:00.320
<v Speaker 6>most.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But that's kind of what it takes,</v>

2163
01:22:00.321 --> 01:22:05.321
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like he looked at richard pryor sort of </v>

2164
01:22:05.321 --> 01:22:05.321
<v Speaker 6>class to be you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It has to be you.</v>

2165
01:22:05.321 --> 01:22:05.960
<v Speaker 6>And so very few women actually are that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2166
01:22:05.961 --> 01:22:06.710
<v Speaker 6>sarah silverman,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the reason,</v>

2167
01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:09.470
<v Speaker 6>one of the reasons why she's so funny </v>
<v Speaker 6>and so brash and dirty,</v>

2168
01:22:09.471 --> 01:22:12.350
<v Speaker 6>it's like that's what's funny to her,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's who she really is.</v>

2169
01:22:12.950 --> 01:22:14.480
<v Speaker 6>And it has to really be you.</v>

2170
01:22:14.660 --> 01:22:15.410
<v Speaker 6>And there's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2171
01:22:15.411 --> 01:22:16.290
<v Speaker 6>for doing an act.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2172
01:22:16.291 --> 01:22:19.160
<v Speaker 6>for a lot of men that's always meant </v>
<v Speaker 6>men.</v>

2173
01:22:19.370 --> 01:22:21.920
<v Speaker 6>Ninety percent of all men talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2174
01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:27.040
<v Speaker 6>a lot of the same situations and you </v>
<v Speaker 6>know that you can relate to anyone even </v>

2175
01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:31.031
<v Speaker 6>if they're on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 6>unless they're like as extreme as like </v>

2176
01:22:31.031 --> 01:22:32.860
<v Speaker 6>say joey diaz and until he deals,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we'll take it into the average man </v>

2177
01:22:32.860 --> 01:22:34.010
<v Speaker 6>really has no.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But for most women,</v>

2178
01:22:34.011 --> 01:22:39.011
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like conversations like men don't want </v>

2179
01:22:39.011 --> 01:22:39.230
<v Speaker 6>to hear you talk about politics.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Men don't want to hear your opinions.</v>

2180
01:22:39.350 --> 01:22:44.350
<v Speaker 6>Men don't want to hear you talking about</v>
<v Speaker 6>you getting laid and then don't want to </v>

2181
01:22:44.350 --> 01:22:46.430
<v Speaker 6>hear you talking about like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck is this bitch so limited.</v>

2182
01:22:46.431 --> 01:22:48.410
<v Speaker 6>They're limited.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And they can't be the alpha,</v>

2183
01:22:48.500 --> 01:22:53.500
<v Speaker 6>they can't be the one who has this idea </v>
<v Speaker 6>that maybe everybody should listen to </v>

2184
01:22:53.500 --> 01:22:53.500
<v Speaker 6>because it makes sense.</v>

2185
01:22:53.500 --> 01:22:57.280
<v Speaker 6>You can't be that person.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The last thing any fucking asshole man </v>

2186
01:22:57.280 --> 01:22:58.160
<v Speaker 6>wants to do as being the audience with </v>
<v Speaker 6>some woman's smarter than him.</v>

2187
01:22:58.161 --> 01:23:03.161
<v Speaker 6>That's making a lot of sense.</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's saying some shit that he should </v>

2188
01:23:03.161 --> 01:23:03.161
<v Speaker 6>have thought up on his own because look,</v>
<v Speaker 6>controlling that.</v>

2189
01:23:03.161 --> 01:23:03.500
<v Speaker 6>Good luck that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2190
01:23:03.501 --> 01:23:05.470
<v Speaker 6>And good luck with politics.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Know.</v>

2191
01:23:05.471 --> 01:23:08.230
<v Speaker 6>And then I'll always oppose women on </v>
<v Speaker 6>political issues.</v>

2192
01:23:08.380 --> 01:23:10.690
<v Speaker 6>I know a lot of men who,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when women think one way,</v>

2193
01:23:10.691 --> 01:23:13.090
<v Speaker 6>they'll think the other way,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just because a woman thinks that way.</v>

2194
01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:13.780
<v Speaker 6>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2195
01:23:13.781 --> 01:23:15.340
<v Speaker 6>it's just natural.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's ingrained.</v>

2196
01:23:15.660 --> 01:23:17.950
<v Speaker 6>It's ingrained to not want a woman to </v>
<v Speaker 6>control you.</v>

2197
01:23:17.960 --> 01:23:22.960
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So many comedians just rely upon the </v>

2198
01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:22.960
<v Speaker 4>whole lake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Marriage sucks,</v>

2199
01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:24.300
<v Speaker 4>like unhappy american male type thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then it's just,</v>

2200
01:23:24.301 --> 01:23:24.830
<v Speaker 4>it's sad.</v>

2201
01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:25.860
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know what it is.</v>

2202
01:23:25.861 --> 01:23:27.060
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>first of all,</v>

2203
01:23:27.061 --> 01:23:29.160
<v Speaker 6>that is a lot of what they are.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2204
01:23:29.161 --> 01:23:34.161
<v Speaker 6>a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>especially if you're shitty at </v>

2205
01:23:34.161 --> 01:23:34.161
<v Speaker 6>relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you don't know what I mean.</v>

2206
01:23:34.161 --> 01:23:34.740
<v Speaker 6>You're most.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We know a lot of people that are fucking</v>

2207
01:23:34.741 --> 01:23:36.080
<v Speaker 6>terrible relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

2208
01:23:36.230 --> 01:23:37.800
<v Speaker 6>It is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And it's also,</v>

2209
01:23:38.050 --> 01:23:38.730
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2210
01:23:38.731 --> 01:23:43.731
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they get programmed into thinking that </v>

2211
01:23:43.731 --> 01:23:43.731
<v Speaker 6>that's what's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2212
01:23:43.731 --> 01:23:44.080
<v Speaker 6>That this is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is the angle was what everybody.</v>

2213
01:23:44.370 --> 01:23:46.370
<v Speaker 4>The whole like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my life sucks like that.</v>

2214
01:23:46.371 --> 01:23:47.690
<v Speaker 4>So that's the way it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>

2215
01:23:47.691 --> 01:23:48.920
<v Speaker 4>I feel sympathy for you.</v>

2216
01:23:49.110 --> 01:23:54.110
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But some people will come out with it </v>

2217
01:23:54.110 --> 01:23:54.110
<v Speaker 6>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2218
01:23:54.110 --> 01:23:54.110
<v Speaker 6>it's real,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2219
01:23:54.110 --> 01:23:58.671
<v Speaker 6>it's like two people can talk about the </v>
<v Speaker 6>same subjects and why it works and the </v>

2220
01:23:58.671 --> 01:23:59.970
<v Speaker 6>other one that doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And the one that works,</v>

2221
01:23:59.971 --> 01:24:02.130
<v Speaker 6>it works because the shit is coming from</v>
<v Speaker 6>a real place.</v>

2222
01:24:02.610 --> 01:24:05.760
<v Speaker 6>That's like the most important thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think any kind of art,</v>

2223
01:24:05.790 --> 01:24:08.760
<v Speaker 6>it's got to come from a real place to </v>
<v Speaker 6>order to really resonate with people.</v>

2224
01:24:08.761 --> 01:24:10.830
<v Speaker 6>This has to actually be what you want to</v>
<v Speaker 6>do.</v>

2225
01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:12.680
<v Speaker 4>You and I started watching,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>a teenager.</v>

2229
01:24:23.031 --> 01:24:26.420
<v Speaker 4>We would watch that shit like we would </v>
<v Speaker 4>watch movies.</v>

<v Speaker 6>I didn't know,</v>

2282
01:26:13.561 --> 01:26:16.180
<v Speaker 6>like everybody was talking about how fox</v>
<v Speaker 6>is or like sweet.</v>

2283
01:26:16.220 --> 01:26:18.350
<v Speaker 6>Oh they're so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Look at the fantasy five too.</v>

2284
01:26:18.390 --> 01:26:20.840
<v Speaker 6>Then I saw a fox dragging a font and I </v>
<v Speaker 6>was like,</v>

2285
01:26:20.900 --> 01:26:22.430
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is real shit.</v>

2286
01:26:22.431 --> 01:26:24.340
<v Speaker 6>You ever actually get to be around into </v>
<v Speaker 6>the big katzman?</v>

2287
01:26:24.610 --> 01:26:29.610
<v Speaker 6>Well I saw this one mountain lion that </v>
<v Speaker 6>was in my yard and it was about 60 </v>

2288
01:26:29.610 --> 01:26:29.750
<v Speaker 6>pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 6>70 pounds.</v>

2289
01:26:29.751 --> 01:26:33.140
<v Speaker 6>It was like a dog,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like a german shepherd size wasn't big.</v>

2290
01:26:33.141 --> 01:26:34.010
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

2291
01:26:34.040 --> 01:26:35.570
<v Speaker 6>holy shit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is going to eat me.</v>

2292
01:26:35.720 --> 01:26:36.530
<v Speaker 6>It was big,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

2293
01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:38.450
<v Speaker 6>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's a mountain lion.</v>

2294
01:26:38.451 --> 01:26:43.451
<v Speaker 6>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was almost kinda like more shocking </v>

2295
01:26:43.451 --> 01:26:44.090
<v Speaker 6>that it was smaller because then I knew </v>
<v Speaker 6>it was real.</v>

2296
01:26:44.210 --> 01:26:46.050
<v Speaker 6>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like I expected if you're going to see a</v>

2297
01:26:46.051 --> 01:26:46.680
<v Speaker 6>mountain lion,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I must,</v>

2298
01:26:46.681 --> 01:26:51.681
<v Speaker 6>he a full grown mountain lion walking </v>
<v Speaker 6>through the woods and something about </v>

2299
01:26:51.681 --> 01:26:51.860
<v Speaker 6>the small one.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I was like,</v>

01:26:51.861 --> 01:26:53.510
<v Speaker 6>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like there's small ones too.</v>

2301
01:26:53.511 --> 01:26:55.460
<v Speaker 6>Like how many of them are out there?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I started thinking like,</v>

2302
01:26:55.730 --> 01:26:58.580
<v Speaker 6>how many of these fucking creatures will</v>
<v Speaker 6>live in the woods and just kill it.</v>

2303
01:26:59.120 --> 01:27:01.390
<v Speaker 5>I had a cat killed by a economy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it was a coyote,</v>

2304
01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:03.970
<v Speaker 5>one of my mom's place and tIme.</v>

<v Speaker 6>get in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they would,</v>

<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they would get in and they would ship </v>

2311
01:27:15.811 --> 01:27:15.811
<v Speaker 6>all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They would shit over by my pool.</v>

<v Speaker 5>little,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a seven year old niece at the san diego </v>

2326
01:27:40.681 --> 01:27:43.111
<v Speaker 5>zoo or the wild animal park and kind of </v>
<v Speaker 5>go behind the scenes to check out the </v>

2327

<v Speaker 5>whole sheet set up there and uh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2330
01:27:49.141 --> 01:27:51.901
<v Speaker 5>And just hearing that it sounds like it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a harley davidson right in person </v>

2331
01:27:51.901 --> 01:27:55.861
<v Speaker 5>and you see this the first actually </v>
<v Speaker 5>really course and they have a certain </v>

2332
01:27:55.861 --> 01:27:55.861
<v Speaker 5>presence about them just like I don't </v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck with me.</v>

2333
01:27:55.861 --> 01:27:56.860
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I'm at that point I'm like,</v>

2334
01:27:56.861 --> 01:27:58.120
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll go and I'll get my photo op and I'm</v>

2335
01:27:58.121 --> 01:28:03.121
<v Speaker 5>gonna get the hell out because I don't </v>
<v Speaker 5>want to have my face eat and like that </v>

2336
01:28:03.121 --> 01:28:03.121
<v Speaker 5>bad in that lady a while ago.</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

2337
01:28:03.121 --> 01:28:03.700
<v Speaker 5>And then there was another one that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>just pacing the cage,</v>

2338
01:28:03.790 --> 01:28:06.100
<v Speaker 5>the cage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And when she saw my little niece,</v>

2339
01:28:06.250 --> 01:28:11.250
<v Speaker 5>she stopped immediately made eye contact</v>
<v Speaker 5>and my niece could sense that this </v>

2340
01:28:11.250 --> 01:28:14.551
<v Speaker 5>creature like looked at her and want her</v>
<v Speaker 5>to eat her and just like completely </v>

2341
01:28:14.551 --> 01:28:14.551
<v Speaker 5>brand behind my brother's legs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2342
01:28:14.551 --> 01:28:15.550
<v Speaker 5>Because the cheated just saw her as </v>
<v Speaker 5>food.</v>

2343
01:28:15.551 --> 01:28:20.551
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just that primal instinct just </v>

2344
01:28:20.551 --> 01:28:20.551
<v Speaker 5>kicked in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2345
01:28:20.551 --> 01:28:20.551
<v Speaker 5>They can't help it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cheetahs can be domesticated.</v>

2346
01:28:20.551 --> 01:28:24.751
<v Speaker 5>They're one of the few animals that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that you can successfully domestIcate </v>

2347
01:28:24.751 --> 01:28:25.360
<v Speaker 5>them or they're actually in the low end </v>
<v Speaker 5>of the cat food chain in africa too,</v>

2348
01:28:25.361 --> 01:28:25.570
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2349
01:28:25.570 --> 01:28:27.870
<v Speaker 5>Is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're actually somewhat majored.</v>

2350
01:28:28.040 --> 01:28:29.440
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2351
01:28:29.500 --> 01:28:32.290
<v Speaker 5>And people have actually kept them as </v>
<v Speaker 5>pets and trained them and shit.</v>

2352
01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:35.380
<v Speaker 5>I guess they don't kill you dude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean a few animals.</v>

2353
01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:36.910
<v Speaker 5>I'm still not going to trust it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2354
01:28:36.911 --> 01:28:37.930
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was a smart move,</v>

2355
01:28:37.931 --> 01:28:40.870
<v Speaker 5>especially with your nice man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So she wasn't allowed in with them.</v>

2356
01:28:40.871 --> 01:28:41.440
<v Speaker 5>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2357
01:28:41.610 --> 01:28:43.200
<v Speaker 5>I mean even,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2358
01:28:43.450 --> 01:28:46.660
<v Speaker 5>having it aware that that's food,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you know it overseas or again,</v>

2359
01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:51.720
<v Speaker 5>it was funny to realize is it right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they didn't realize it was.</v>

2360
01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:54.010
<v Speaker 5>It was a magic moments are like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all right,</v>

2361
01:28:54.011 --> 01:28:55.110
<v Speaker 5>this is something that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2362
01:28:55.860 --> 01:28:56.100
<v Speaker 5>That's</v>

2363
01:28:56.100 --> 01:28:58.230
<v Speaker 6>some scary shit dude.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Big cats of the scariest.</v>

2364
01:28:58.260 --> 01:29:02.040
<v Speaker 6>They say that the reason why we have </v>
<v Speaker 6>scared where people afraid of monsters</v>

2365
01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:07.040
<v Speaker 4>like every kid is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'll just leftover dna from monkeys </v>

2366
01:29:07.040 --> 01:29:07.800
<v Speaker 4>getting jacked yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But cats back when we were,</v>

2367
01:29:07.860 --> 01:29:09.290
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>subhuman,</v>

2368
01:29:09.620 --> 01:29:12.000
<v Speaker 4>hominoid parental instinct to avoid </v>
<v Speaker 4>scary stuff,</v>

2369
01:29:12.001 --> 01:29:12.480
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2370
01:29:12.481 --> 01:29:15.270
<v Speaker 4>And like if there's an old Stephen King </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing line,</v>

2371
01:29:15.271 --> 01:29:17.370
<v Speaker 4>I can't remember what it was from where </v>
<v Speaker 4>he was saying,</v>

2372
01:29:17.371 --> 01:29:22.371
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the lightening crashes and the door </v>

2373
01:29:22.371 --> 01:29:23.811
<v Speaker 4>opens and you see a 40 foot bug,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they are part of you is happy because </v>

2374
01:29:23.811 --> 01:29:23.850
<v Speaker 4>you're expecting 60 foot bug.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2375
01:29:23.851 --> 01:29:25.290
<v Speaker 4>Like thAt's why alien worked,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2376
01:29:25.291 --> 01:29:30.291
<v Speaker 4>Because you don't see the full alien </v>
<v Speaker 4>right at the beginning you see the </v>

2377
01:29:30.291 --> 01:29:32.631
<v Speaker 4>little bit of the leg,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a little bit of the tail and you're </v>

2378
01:29:32.631 --> 01:29:32.631
<v Speaker 4>imagining like what could this thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>possibly look like?</v>

2379
01:29:32.631 --> 01:29:32.670
<v Speaker 4>And yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was the most screwed up.</v>

2380
01:29:32.700 --> 01:29:36.690
<v Speaker 4>Awesome hr giger design like ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>but at the same tIme in your head,</v>

2381
01:29:36.691 --> 01:29:41.691
<v Speaker 4>it was still out there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We already watched aliens recently is </v>

2382
01:29:41.691 --> 01:29:42.930
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the problem with aliens is that they</v>

2383
01:29:42.931 --> 01:29:47.130
<v Speaker 4>established an alien that this thing is </v>
<v Speaker 4>super fucking intelligent,</v>

2384
01:29:47.131 --> 01:29:49.170
<v Speaker 4>really fast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gigantic,</v>

2385
01:29:49.260 --> 01:29:52.350
<v Speaker 4>super resourceful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very crafty and sneaky.</v>

2386
01:29:52.470 --> 01:29:57.470
<v Speaker 4>But then the second one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're just shooting them left and </v>

2387
01:29:57.470 --> 01:29:57.470
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they're dying.</v>

2388
01:29:57.870 --> 01:29:58.830
<v Speaker 4>They needed one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2389
01:29:58.831 --> 01:30:02.010
<v Speaker 4>it was one daily versus the truckers to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They went too quick.</v>

2390
01:30:02.190 --> 01:30:04.710
<v Speaker 4>They should have had less aliens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's look who the fuck of mine.</v>

2391
01:30:04.920 --> 01:30:09.920
<v Speaker 4>Movie designer telling them one of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>greatest science fiction movies of all </v>

2392
01:30:09.920 --> 01:30:09.920
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>IT's still an amazing movie.</v>

2393
01:30:09.920 --> 01:30:11.040
<v Speaker 4>But to me I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wait a minute.</v>

2394
01:30:11.041 --> 01:30:13.770
<v Speaker 4>You can just kill them that easy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone's just running around shotgun.</v>

2395
01:30:13.771 --> 01:30:17.250
<v Speaker 4>I knew better than one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One is an exercise in action.</v>

2396
01:30:17.251 --> 01:30:18.900
<v Speaker 4>One is an exercise in suspense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2397
01:30:19.050 --> 01:30:24.050
<v Speaker 4>One is the tease of the leg.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The other ones the full on blown out </v>

2398
01:30:24.050 --> 01:30:24.050
<v Speaker 4>porno,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2399
01:30:24.050 --> 01:30:26.961
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you ever watched a rewatch the </v>

2400
01:30:26.961 --> 01:30:26.961
<v Speaker 4>things to shoot scenes in the second </v>
<v Speaker 4>one,</v>

2401
01:30:26.961 --> 01:30:29.060
<v Speaker 4>like when she was battling it with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>exoskeleton on,</v>

2402
01:30:29.080 --> 01:30:34.080
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why isn't it just stabbing you in the </v>

2403
01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:35.661
<v Speaker 4>heart?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's got this giant fucking monster </v>

2404
01:30:35.661 --> 01:30:35.661
<v Speaker 4>tale.</v>

2405
01:30:35.661 --> 01:30:36.510
<v Speaker 4>Why isn't it just scooping you out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>your camera and sat down and he's like,</v>

2406
01:30:36.580 --> 01:30:38.640
<v Speaker 4>I want to see a fucking mac versus an </v>
<v Speaker 4>alien.</v>

2407
01:30:39.210 --> 01:30:40.980
<v Speaker 4>there's a certain point in creativity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2408
01:30:40.981 --> 01:30:41.880
<v Speaker 4>where you have to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>

2409
01:30:42.090 --> 01:30:44.910
<v Speaker 4>A gun with a chainsaw.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It makes absolutely no sense on it.</v>

2410
01:30:45.120 --> 01:30:46.830
<v Speaker 4>Like even look at the design.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you went to grab the gun,</v>

2411
01:30:46.831 --> 01:30:48.060
<v Speaker 4>you saw your finger off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>RighT?</v>

2412
01:30:48.240 --> 01:30:49.940
<v Speaker 4>But it's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2413
01:30:49.950 --> 01:30:51.840
<v Speaker 4>but what I'm talking about is cut the </v>
<v Speaker 4>shit moments.</v>

2414
01:30:51.841 --> 01:30:56.841
<v Speaker 4>I'm the suspension of disbelief where </v>
<v Speaker 4>you make me go in a place where I think </v>

2415
01:30:56.841 --> 01:30:57.510
<v Speaker 4>you got lazy or you did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So why are you making me go here?</v>

2416
01:30:57.660 --> 01:30:59.160
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why is this your conclusion?</v>

2417
01:30:59.161 --> 01:30:59.530
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How?</v>

2418
01:30:59.580 --> 01:31:04.580
<v Speaker 4>How's this bitch fight in the city?</v>
<v Speaker 4>All they had to do is build a certain </v>

2419
01:31:04.580 --> 01:31:05.040
<v Speaker 4>amount of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they had make it believable.</v>

2420
01:31:05.041 --> 01:31:06.300
<v Speaker 4>You gotta you gotta,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you gotta.</v>

2421
01:31:06.540 --> 01:31:11.540

<v Speaker 4>Oh well I guess it's just really bad </v>

2422
01:31:11.540 --> 01:31:15.381
<v Speaker 4>with its tail today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the same argument that says the </v>

2423
01:31:15.381 --> 01:31:15.381
<v Speaker 4>lord of the rings.</v>
<v Speaker 4>why didn't they just grabbed those birds</v>

2424
01:31:15.381 --> 01:31:18.630
<v Speaker 4>at the end of it and have them fly over </v>
<v Speaker 4>and drop the ring into the volcano?</v>

2425
01:31:18.631 --> 01:31:19.770
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there's always.</v>

2426
01:31:19.800 --> 01:31:23.100

01:34:17.100 --> 01:34:19.630
<v Speaker 7>Like in their little girls out there </v>
<v Speaker 7>that are looking up to her right now.</v>

2510
01:34:19.780 --> 01:34:21.310
<v Speaker 7>I had a buddy of mine recently who,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2511
01:34:21.610 --> 01:34:26.610
<v Speaker 7>actually finally,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm sure this happens in la all the </v>

2512
01:34:26.610 --> 01:34:28.801
<v Speaker 7>time,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but he found it ex-girlfriend actually </v>

2513
01:34:28.801 --> 01:34:28.801
<v Speaker 7>in a random porn video online.</v>

2514
01:34:28.801 --> 01:34:29.050
<v Speaker 7>No way.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's got to be.</v>

2515
01:34:29.410 --> 01:34:34.410
<v Speaker 7>I want it to happen one day.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I want to be able to just go sell my </v>

2516
01:34:34.410 --> 01:34:34.410
<v Speaker 7>feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

2517
01:34:34.410 --> 01:34:35.170
<v Speaker 7>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's one of those things like if you sit</v>

2518
01:34:35.171 --> 01:34:36.030
<v Speaker 7>there,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like I say,</v>

2519
01:34:36.031 --> 01:34:37.990
<v Speaker 7>like porn is like on the internet,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's like a,</v>

2520
01:34:38.170 --> 01:34:43.170
<v Speaker 7>a mandelbrot fractal.</v>
<v Speaker 7>he just keeps going and going and you </v>

2521
01:34:43.170 --> 01:34:43.170
<v Speaker 7>could just keep the.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And it's never ending.</v>

2522
01:34:43.170 --> 01:34:47.731
<v Speaker 7>Like when we were growing up it was like</v>
<v Speaker 7>asia carrera and like a ginger lynn and </v>

2523
01:34:48.311 --> 01:34:53.311
<v Speaker 7>then like jamison and then janet and I </v>
<v Speaker 7>was like the same 15 actors just </v>

2524
01:34:53.311 --> 01:34:54.340
<v Speaker 7>repeated with different spoofs of </v>
<v Speaker 7>movies.</v>

2525
01:34:54.341 --> 01:34:59.341
<v Speaker 7>Right now it's like you can just go on </v>
<v Speaker 7>there and it's like an amount of girls </v>

2526
01:34:59.341 --> 01:34:59.341
<v Speaker 7>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>at what point are you like,</v>

2527
01:34:59.341 --> 01:35:00.650
<v Speaker 7>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so this is a thousand dollars.</v>

2528
01:35:00.890 --> 01:35:02.480
<v Speaker 7>I don't think anybody's ever going to </v>
<v Speaker 7>see this.</v>

2529
01:35:02.481 --> 01:35:03.860
<v Speaker 7>And his reaction,</v>
<v Speaker 7>man,</v>

2530
01:35:03.861 --> 01:35:04.730
<v Speaker 7>it felt so bad for him.</v>

2531
01:35:04.730 --> 01:35:06.410
<v Speaker 7>And of course I teased them like </v>
<v Speaker 7>nobody's business,</v>

2532
01:35:06.411 --> 01:35:07.040
<v Speaker 7>but I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>dude,</v>

2533
01:35:07.041 --> 01:35:09.980
<v Speaker 7>you're getting your,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like you're chasing amy type of a,</v>

2534
01:35:10.270 --> 01:35:12.500
<v Speaker 7>a girl next door type moment.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

2535
01:35:12.501 --> 01:35:14.960
<v Speaker 7>Like if he was just kind of crestfallen </v>
<v Speaker 7>about it,</v>

2536
01:35:14.961 --> 01:35:16.220
<v Speaker 7>they didn't even go out that long.</v>
<v Speaker 7>right.</v>

2537
01:35:16.400 --> 01:35:17.180
<v Speaker 7>But the fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2538
01:35:17.181 --> 01:35:20.360
<v Speaker 7>at some point he found this girl cool </v>
<v Speaker 7>thing hung out and then he finds a video</v>

2539
01:35:20.361 --> 01:35:25.361
<v Speaker 7>over on some random internet site doing </v>
<v Speaker 7>some bad cheerleader porn and it was </v>

2540
01:35:25.361 --> 01:35:25.460
<v Speaker 7>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>just coming back,</v>

2541
01:35:25.461 --> 01:35:30.461
<v Speaker 7>who is this?</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're talking to a buddy of mine in </v>

2542
01:35:30.461 --> 01:35:30.461
<v Speaker 7>town.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You see peopLe in a,</v>

2543
01:35:30.461 --> 01:35:31.040
<v Speaker 7>in la,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm sure it's a common thing to like,</v>

2544

<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>data girl,</v>

2545
01:35:31.780 --> 01:35:34.220

<v Speaker 7>where she's done stuff like that,</v>

2546
01:35:34.221 --> 01:35:35.570
<v Speaker 7>but you don't see it that often.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And,</v>

2547
01:35:35.571 --> 01:35:36.650
<v Speaker 7>and,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and outside of that.</v>

2548
01:35:36.651 --> 01:35:41.651
<v Speaker 7>And I had a friend of mine recently </v>
<v Speaker 7>happened to and imagining the mix of </v>

2549
01:35:41.651 --> 01:35:41.651
<v Speaker 7>feelings.</v>

2550
01:35:41.651 --> 01:35:43.250
<v Speaker 7>He came like,</v>

2597
01:37:06.600 --> 01:37:09.360

01:37:31.821 --> 01:37:31.950
<v Speaker 7>literally plug in the genre.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You could plug in the actors.</v>

2624
01:38:00.691 --> 01:38:02.430
<v Speaker 5>only costs 60,</v>
<v Speaker 5>$60,000,000</v>

2625
01:38:02.431 --> 01:38:07.431
<v Speaker 5>and then blows it out because </v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody's conscious about how much </v>

2626
01:38:07.431 --> 01:38:07.431
<v Speaker 5>money they spend.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Basic economics,</v>

2627
01:38:07.431 --> 01:38:07.431
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

2628
01:38:07.431 --> 01:38:11.631
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're kinda redoubling of doing </v>

2629
01:38:11.631 --> 01:38:11.631
<v Speaker 5>something that's a little bit smaller,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2633
01:38:16.171 --> 01:38:18.020
<v Speaker 5>a lot of it depends on who gets attached</v>
<v Speaker 5>as a director,</v>

2634
01:38:18.030 --> 01:38:18.870
<v Speaker 5>things like that.</v>

01:42:21.330 --> 01:42:23.410
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I cannot imagine doing like 30 cities in</v>

2739
01:42:23.411 --> 01:42:24.280
<v Speaker 4>40 days.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2740
01:42:24.281 --> 01:42:29.281
<v Speaker 4>Like what it takes to actually pull that</v>
<v Speaker 4>off and to sit there and to show up </v>

2741
01:42:29.281 --> 01:42:29.281
<v Speaker 4>every night and to command a stadium.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what does that,</v>

2742
01:42:29.281 --> 01:42:30.040
<v Speaker 4>what does that do to you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2743
01:42:30.041 --> 01:42:31.300
<v Speaker 4>Like how can you actually show up like </v>
<v Speaker 4>that?</v>

2744
01:42:31.301 --> 01:42:36.301
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then at the end of every night </v>

2745
01:42:36.301 --> 01:42:38.130
<v Speaker 4>there's an infinite amount of partying </v>
<v Speaker 4>or just the girls lined up to just do </v>

2746
01:42:38.130 --> 01:42:38.130
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2747
01:42:38.130 --> 01:42:39.170
<v Speaker 4>Like at different city and new people </v>
<v Speaker 4>experience,</v>

2748
01:42:39.171 --> 01:42:44.171
<v Speaker 4>you all think you're gone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You really have to get Back to your </v>

2749
01:42:44.171 --> 01:42:46.321
<v Speaker 4>hotel because you got to get up in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>morning and five hours ago to your </v>

2750
01:42:46.321 --> 01:42:46.321
<v Speaker 4>flight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

2751
01:42:46.321 --> 01:42:46.560
<v Speaker 4>those are the ones who are responsible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2752
01:42:46.810 --> 01:42:47.810
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well it's all the.</v>

2753
01:42:48.030 --> 01:42:49.410
<v Speaker 4>The reality is those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2754
01:42:49.420 --> 01:42:54.420
<v Speaker 4>those tour,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I only did one tour like that most </v>

2755
01:42:54.420 --> 01:42:56.671
<v Speaker 4>of the time what I do with comedy as I </v>
<v Speaker 4>go out on the weekends and then I come </v>

2756
01:42:56.671 --> 01:42:59.701
<v Speaker 4>home,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go out and go out for a couple of </v>

2757
01:42:59.701 --> 01:42:59.701
<v Speaker 4>days,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then I come home.</v>

2758
01:42:59.701 --> 01:43:00.070
<v Speaker 4>But a lot of guys will go out and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll do like,</v>

2759
01:43:00.090 --> 01:43:05.090
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I know why mazda brawny we're </v>

<v Speaker 4>three,</v>
<v Speaker 4>four weeks.</v>

2762
01:43:06.430 --> 01:43:09.700

<v Speaker 4>Most of the time we flew,</v>

2768
01:43:26.290 --> 01:43:28.240

2779
01:43:48.070 --> 01:43:50.170
<v Speaker 4>I do that so often because I travel so </v>
<v Speaker 4>much.</v>

2780
01:43:50.180 --> 01:43:50.380
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>worse feeling in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want to.</v>

2791
01:44:09.311 --> 01:44:09.311
<v Speaker 4>Weird thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

01:44:09.350 --> 01:44:10.960
<v Speaker 4>It's a hotel room.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just pee on the floor.</v>

2793
01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:16.000
<v Speaker 4>And joe had like a scare at a hotel </v>
<v Speaker 4>where we both thought we were going to </v>

2794
01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:19.121
<v Speaker 4>die and we've talked about it before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that really changed the whole thing </v>

2795
01:44:19.121 --> 01:44:19.121
<v Speaker 4>for hotels.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For me,</v>

2796
01:44:19.121 --> 01:44:22.320
<v Speaker 4>I actually fear hotel to hotel rooms.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll check.</v>

2797
01:44:22.440 --> 01:44:24.890
<v Speaker 4>I'll always look out the like somebody </v>
<v Speaker 4>knocks at the door,</v>

2798
01:44:24.891 --> 01:44:27.670
<v Speaker 4>always look out the little law.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The people and fire.</v>

2799
01:44:27.820 --> 01:44:29.140
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wasn't it?</v>

2800
01:44:29.270 --> 01:44:31.580
<v Speaker 4>You know what the problem was?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was in an old hotel.</v>

2801
01:44:31.700 --> 01:44:33.320
<v Speaker 4>It wouldn't have been nearly as much of </v>
<v Speaker 4>a problem,</v>

2802
01:44:33.321 --> 01:44:36.340
<v Speaker 4>but there was a single file staircase </v>
<v Speaker 4>and we were on the fifth.</v>

2803
01:44:36.360 --> 01:44:37.580
<v Speaker 4>I was on the 15th.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What floor were you on?</v>

2804
01:44:37.600 --> 01:44:39.640
<v Speaker 4>I was on the 14th I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

2805
01:44:39.740 --> 01:44:42.560
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you could only get one person on the</v>

2806
01:44:42.561 --> 01:44:45.230
<v Speaker 4>staircase at the time and people were </v>
<v Speaker 4>slow as fuck.</v>

2807
01:44:45.660 --> 01:44:50.660
<v Speaker 4>You feel that you have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you probably felt that like people are </v>

2808
01:44:50.660 --> 01:44:50.660
<v Speaker 4>about to trample each other like at that</v>
<v Speaker 4>threshold,</v>

2809
01:44:50.660 --> 01:44:55.181
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where there's just that instinct kicks </v>

<v Speaker 4>I was the one who will be running on </v>
<v Speaker 4>people's heads.</v>

2813
01:44:55.360 --> 01:45:00.360
<v Speaker 4>I was seconds away from sprinting </v>
<v Speaker 4>through these fucking people with </v>

<v Speaker 4>And they were moving slow as shit.</v>

2817

<v Speaker 4>immediately.</v>

<v Speaker 4>4:30,</v>

<v Speaker 4>at dan chen.</v>

2825
01:45:22.160 --> 01:45:24.470

<v Speaker 4>it was a woman.</v>

2826
01:45:24.490 --> 01:45:28.370
<v Speaker 4>There was a woman talking because while </v>
<v Speaker 4>she was talking she was doing it.</v>

<v Speaker 4>we're so foggy and we're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 4>figure out why,</v>

<v Speaker 4>why,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2831
01:45:33.711 --> 01:45:38.711

<v Speaker 4>me that the fucking buildings on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

<v Speaker 4>sure if this portal,</v>

2836
01:45:47.270 --> 01:45:52.270
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it's a robot or if it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>a real perSon at the building until I </v>

2837
01:45:52.270 --> 01:45:54.440
<v Speaker 4>hear in the background,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we got to get these people outta here.</v>

2838
01:45:54.500 --> 01:45:59.500
<v Speaker 4>Shut them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a guy in the back behind her </v>

2839
01:45:59.500 --> 01:45:59.500
<v Speaker 4>that must,</v>
<v Speaker 4>must've been like,</v>

2840
01:45:59.500 --> 01:45:59.500
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>behind the counter with her.</v>

2841
01:45:59.500 --> 01:46:04.030
<v Speaker 4>It's like we gotta get these people out </v>
<v Speaker 4>of here and then it was just a false </v>

2842
01:46:04.030 --> 01:46:04.790
<v Speaker 4>alarm and he's just decided to fuck with</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody.</v>

2843
01:46:04.791 --> 01:46:05.230
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2844
01:46:05.231 --> 01:46:05.500
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

01:46:05.690 --> 01:46:07.400
<v Speaker 4>it's on the twelfth floor now we need to</v>
<v Speaker 4>get him out.</v>

2846
01:46:07.520 --> 01:46:12.520
<v Speaker 4>I remember thinking that I was the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>exact thing as joke because we had </v>

2847
01:46:12.520 --> 01:46:13.100
<v Speaker 4>talked about it afterwards and I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking the same thing.</v>

2848
01:46:13.101 --> 01:46:16.580
<v Speaker 4>Like I am going to have to start </v>
<v Speaker 4>throwing people out of my way.</v>

2849
01:46:17.060 --> 01:46:21.540
<v Speaker 4>And then I looked at the windows like in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the stairways that was like off the,</v>

2850
01:46:21.730 --> 01:46:26.730
<v Speaker 4>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just amazing how slow people can </v>

2851
01:46:26.730 --> 01:46:26.730
<v Speaker 4>actually physically move.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2852
01:46:26.730 --> 01:46:27.770
<v Speaker 4>like that plane that landed on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>hudson a couple of years ago.</v>

2853
01:46:27.771 --> 01:46:30.100
<v Speaker 4>Like I would've just crapped my pants.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

2854
01:46:30.110 --> 01:46:31.020
<v Speaker 4>get me off of thiS.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2855
01:46:31.030 --> 01:46:33.800
<v Speaker 4>So how many people do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are barely taking care of their body?</v>

2856
01:46:34.040 --> 01:46:36.170
<v Speaker 4>Barely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Barely,</v>

2857
01:46:36.200 --> 01:46:37.670
<v Speaker 4>barely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Next to that guy on the plane.</v>

2858
01:46:37.680 --> 01:46:40.190
<v Speaker 4>It gives you the extra elbow rest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2859
01:46:40.400 --> 01:46:45.400
<v Speaker 4>When it's leaking over under your seat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we were thinking about that when we </v>

2860
01:46:45.400 --> 01:46:45.530
<v Speaker 4>were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we had ralphie on the podcast.</v>

2861
01:46:45.531 --> 01:46:48.970
<v Speaker 4>He means brian and he barely sat in an </v>
<v Speaker 4>account together.</v>

2862
01:46:49.030 --> 01:46:54.030
<v Speaker 4>Mean what happens if you're on southwest</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you got to sit next to him to say </v>

2863
01:46:54.030 --> 01:46:54.030
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all about the lap band now.</v>

2864
01:46:54.150 --> 01:46:55.680
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck is this dude?</v>

2865
01:46:55.681 --> 01:46:57.560
<v Speaker 4>It's everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's on every billboard there.</v>

2866
01:46:57.720 --> 01:47:00.210
<v Speaker 4>so gluttonous that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2867
01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:05.480
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a picture from a long time </v>

2868
01:47:05.480 --> 01:47:05.480
<v Speaker 4>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the beginning of the,</v>

2869
01:47:05.480 --> 01:47:06.660
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the 18th century or the 19th century,</v>

2870
01:47:06.661 --> 01:47:11.661
<v Speaker 4>there was like a carnival and they had </v>
<v Speaker 4>the fat man in the carnival sideshow </v>

2871
01:47:11.661 --> 01:47:16.191
<v Speaker 4>free spirited woman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fat man and the fat man wasn't </v>

2872
01:47:16.191 --> 01:47:16.191
<v Speaker 4>nearly as big as ralphie may.</v>

2873
01:47:16.191 --> 01:47:20.490
<v Speaker 4>This guy was a freak back then we'll do </v>
<v Speaker 4>what because people had a fucking work </v>

2874
01:47:20.490 --> 01:47:23.100
<v Speaker 4>and move around that it's moving.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's also the average american diet,</v>

2875
01:47:23.160 --> 01:47:25.020
<v Speaker 4>the average american diet like three </v>
<v Speaker 4>flavors,</v>

2876
01:47:25.050 --> 01:47:30.050
<v Speaker 4>fat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sugar and salt that everywhere you're </v>

2877
01:47:30.050 --> 01:47:33.561
<v Speaker 4>trained,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have an entire generation of kids </v>

2878
01:47:33.561 --> 01:47:33.561
<v Speaker 4>that will not eat food without ketchup </v>
<v Speaker 4>on it.</v>

2879
01:47:33.561 --> 01:47:35.130
<v Speaker 4>Like they just won't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just have to catch up and catch up.</v>

2880
01:47:35.131 --> 01:47:36.290
<v Speaker 4>Chicken fingers and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do,</v>

2881
01:47:36.330 --> 01:47:41.330
<v Speaker 4>heaven forbid you take them out and I'll</v>
<v Speaker 4>give him some fish or try curry or </v>

2882
01:47:41.330 --> 01:47:41.330
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like just,</v>

2883
01:47:41.330 --> 01:47:41.360
<v Speaker 4>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just.</v>

2884
01:47:41.370 --> 01:47:42.910
<v Speaker 4>And then you don't think about </v>
<v Speaker 4>mcdonald's.</v>

2885
01:47:43.540 --> 01:47:45.330
<v Speaker 4>Get them young.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2886
01:47:45.331 --> 01:47:50.331
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well the thing is about like this lap </v>

2887
01:47:50.331 --> 01:47:51.861
<v Speaker 4>band thing is what's really creepy about</v>
<v Speaker 4>is all you're doing is making the </v>

2888
01:47:51.861 --> 01:47:53.070
<v Speaker 4>stomach smaller.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that you get full quicker,</v>

2889
01:47:53.160 --> 01:47:55.680
<v Speaker 4>so all you have to do is just stop </v>
<v Speaker 4>eating so much.</v>

2890
01:47:55.710 --> 01:47:56.830
<v Speaker 4>But it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's that simple.</v>

2891
01:47:56.850 --> 01:47:58.500
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's hitting your dopamine receptors and</v>

2892
01:47:58.520 --> 01:48:00.060
<v Speaker 4>you've been trained for that and that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>the only thing,</v>

2893
01:48:00.061 --> 01:48:00.500
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

2894
01:48:00.530 --> 01:48:01.360
<v Speaker 4>we talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2895
01:48:01.361 --> 01:48:03.900
<v Speaker 4>can you just try and get half portion </v>
<v Speaker 4>please?</v>

2896
01:48:03.901 --> 01:48:05.260
<v Speaker 4>Like it's huge now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2897
01:48:05.261 --> 01:48:10.261
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when you're filling up and you have </v>

2898
01:48:10.261 --> 01:48:11.991
<v Speaker 4>this lap band thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you have this tiny baby fake stomach </v>

2899
01:48:11.991 --> 01:48:11.991
<v Speaker 4>now and that little fake stomach filling</v>
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>

2900
01:48:11.991 --> 01:48:14.010
<v Speaker 4>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>does your doberman receptors go off?</v>

2901
01:48:14.011 --> 01:48:18.600
<v Speaker 4>Do you get the chemicals that sale it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dude,</v>

2902
01:48:18.601 --> 01:48:23.601
<v Speaker 4>it's on every billboard and apparently </v>
<v Speaker 4>the surgery is not invasive enough that </v>

2903
01:48:23.601 --> 01:48:26.461
<v Speaker 4>it's the point it's going to be like </v>
<v Speaker 4>you've watched people get the lap band </v>

2904
01:48:26.461 --> 01:48:26.461
<v Speaker 4>installed in the mall,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like laser eye surgery.</v>

2905
01:48:26.461 --> 01:48:26.850
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I do that dental.</v>

2906
01:48:26.851 --> 01:48:28.470
<v Speaker 4>Why'd they get your lap band while </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're at it?</v>

2907
01:48:28.471 --> 01:48:29.090
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2908
01:48:29.100 --> 01:48:32.160
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Isn't it like a shitty fix to a problem.</v>

2909
01:48:32.160 --> 01:48:34.530
<v Speaker 4>That's obviously a lifestyle and diet </v>
<v Speaker 4>problems.</v>

2910
01:48:34.560 --> 01:48:35.910
<v Speaker 4>Somebody saw profit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2911
01:48:35.911 --> 01:48:37.050
<v Speaker 4>And yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's true.</v>

2912
01:48:37.051 --> 01:48:38.820
<v Speaker 4>I mean obviously like the shake weight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2913
01:48:38.880 --> 01:48:43.880
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's so weird though is like when you </v>

2914
01:48:43.880 --> 01:48:43.880
<v Speaker 4>talk to somebody that's like insanely </v>
<v Speaker 4>obese,</v>

2915
01:48:44.720 --> 01:48:46.950
<v Speaker 4>I know he's drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's drunk,</v>

2916
01:48:46.960 --> 01:48:47.910
<v Speaker 4>sled,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't do that.</v>

2917
01:48:48.290 --> 01:48:51.010
<v Speaker 4>I'm drinking a bottle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She licks,</v>

2918
01:48:51.890 --> 01:48:53.850
<v Speaker 4>he's used to list looking cylindrical </v>
<v Speaker 4>things in your home,</v>

2919
01:48:54.210 --> 01:48:56.580
<v Speaker 4>but it's like you talked to these people</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they're always like,</v>

2920
01:48:56.760 --> 01:48:58.950
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know what the problem is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's fibroids.</v>

2921
01:48:59.100 --> 01:49:00.600
<v Speaker 4>This is that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm on a diet.</v>

2922
01:49:00.720 --> 01:49:02.550
<v Speaker 4>But then you hear the other stories were</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2923
01:49:02.551 --> 01:49:07.551
<v Speaker 4>no dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he went to jack in the box and pretty </v>

2924
01:49:07.551 --> 01:49:10.071
<v Speaker 4>much ordered like 13.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I honestly think it's the same thing as </v>

2925
01:49:10.071 --> 01:49:12.000
<v Speaker 4>the guy who just works out to the point </v>
<v Speaker 4>where it looks like he's just comedic.</v>

2926
01:49:12.060 --> 01:49:13.740
<v Speaker 4>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's an addiction.</v>

2927
01:49:14.190 --> 01:49:15.470
<v Speaker 4>I honestly think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2928
01:49:15.471 --> 01:49:17.130
<v Speaker 4>I guess so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's a little more.</v>

2929
01:49:17.131 --> 01:49:20.400
<v Speaker 4>That's a different kind of totally </v>
<v Speaker 4>different kinds of craziness.</v>

2930
01:49:21.090 --> 01:49:26.090
<v Speaker 4>The crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fat craziness is just like they're </v>

2931
01:49:26.090 --> 01:49:26.090
<v Speaker 4>just trying to die or something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2932
01:49:26.090 --> 01:49:30.441
<v Speaker 4>like I have a friend who I know has like</v>
<v Speaker 4>a massive food addiction and just </v>

2933
01:49:31.561 --> 01:49:33.510
<v Speaker 4>anytime he's around fast food,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he just,</v>

2934
01:49:33.511 --> 01:49:35.290
<v Speaker 4>he can't drive by a jacket.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yes.</v>

2935
01:49:35.550 --> 01:49:39.030
<v Speaker 4>He's going to go in and you're trained </v>
<v Speaker 4>at a young age to enjoy those flavors.</v>

2936
01:49:39.031 --> 01:49:41.330
<v Speaker 4>also mad and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a stealth calorie thing also.</v>

2937
01:49:41.690 --> 01:49:43.190
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he knows he's fat.</v>

2938
01:49:43.191 --> 01:49:48.191
<v Speaker 4>He's on talks about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's trying to do things and never has </v>

2939
01:49:48.191 --> 01:49:50.410
<v Speaker 4>done anything and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you know in your head that you should</v>

2940
01:49:50.860 --> 01:49:55.860
<v Speaker 4>stop doing this and you have a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very strange that you can't rewire </v>

2941
01:49:55.860 --> 01:49:56.320
<v Speaker 4>your brain to recognize that like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2942
01:49:56.321 --> 01:49:57.820
<v Speaker 4>this is something I'm aware of now.</v>

2943
01:49:57.910 --> 01:49:59.190
<v Speaker 4>Now I just need to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a.</v>

2944
01:49:59.240 --> 01:50:03.070
<v Speaker 4>Once people get set on a certain path,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then at a certain point they just go,</v>

2945
01:50:03.071 --> 01:50:03.460
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

2946
01:50:03.461 --> 01:50:05.020
<v Speaker 4>Breaking that cycle is the hardest </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

2947
01:50:05.050 --> 01:50:06.430
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But why does that exist?</v>

2948
01:50:06.460 --> 01:50:08.770
<v Speaker 4>The big question is why is that in our </v>
<v Speaker 4>system?</v>

2949
01:50:08.950 --> 01:50:13.950
<v Speaker 4>Why is it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it the same thing that allows us to </v>

2950
01:50:13.950 --> 01:50:13.950
<v Speaker 4>get obsessed with things and get really </v>
<v Speaker 4>good at things?</v>

2951
01:50:13.950 --> 01:50:16.630
<v Speaker 4>Is it like a bastardization?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do we all know what borders are now?</v>

2952
01:50:16.631 --> 01:50:18.490
<v Speaker 4>My grandpa was a hoarder when she died.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My,</v>

2953
01:50:18.491 --> 01:50:23.491
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my uncle wound up having to clean out </v>

2954
01:50:23.491 --> 01:50:25.681
<v Speaker 4>her place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember as a kid going to visit her </v>

2955
01:50:25.681 --> 01:50:27.690
<v Speaker 4>and she would have stacks of national </v>
<v Speaker 4>geographic five feet high with her goat </v>

2956
01:50:27.690 --> 01:50:27.690
<v Speaker 4>paths.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'd have to navigate.</v>

2957
01:50:27.690 --> 01:50:29.470
<v Speaker 4>You go to the bathroom to pee in her </v>
<v Speaker 4>bathtub.</v>

2958
01:50:29.471 --> 01:50:31.930
<v Speaker 4>Was used to have bags of clothes in it.</v>

2959
01:50:31.980 --> 01:50:36.980
<v Speaker 4>She'd never really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We always wondering why grandma smelled </v>

2960
01:50:36.980 --> 01:50:36.980
<v Speaker 4>sweaty and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she wouldn't.</v>

2961
01:50:36.980 --> 01:50:37.060
<v Speaker 4>Didn't wear deodorant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>joe,</v>

2962
01:50:37.061 --> 01:50:38.820
<v Speaker 4>but my grandmother was the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your,</v>

2963
01:50:38.900 --> 01:50:40.660
<v Speaker 4>your grandmother didn't wear deodorant </v>

<v Speaker 4>Not.</v>

2965
01:50:41.381 --> 01:50:46.381
<v Speaker 4>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe she just didn't think it was okay </v>

2966
01:50:46.381 --> 01:50:46.420
<v Speaker 4>to plug up her armpits with stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm interested to wear deodorant.</v>

2967
01:50:46.421 --> 01:50:49.740
<v Speaker 4>I just don't wear antiperspirant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One thing is just smell.</v>

2968
01:50:49.741 --> 01:50:50.680
<v Speaker 4>Just giving shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2969
01:50:50.710 --> 01:50:52.930
<v Speaker 4>Stopping the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My grandmother was completely crazy.</v>

2970
01:50:53.170 --> 01:50:55.060
<v Speaker 4>My grandmother when she died was exactly</v>
<v Speaker 4>the same thing.</v>

2971
01:50:55.061 --> 01:50:56.890
<v Speaker 4>They had a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They had a clean out her.</v>

2972
01:50:56.891 --> 01:51:01.891
<v Speaker 4>My uncle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a control thing when you </v>

2973
01:51:01.891 --> 01:51:01.891
<v Speaker 4>give her much borders.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2974
01:51:01.891 --> 01:51:04.180
<v Speaker 4>Usually the husband obsession husbands,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some train wreck and the.</v>

2975
01:51:04.220 --> 01:51:06.490
<v Speaker 4>Something's gone south,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's this one thing that they can.</v>

2976
01:51:06.550 --> 01:51:08.290
<v Speaker 4>They can control and in their life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

2977
01:51:08.291 --> 01:51:13.291
<v Speaker 4>It may be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but she was insane about a bunch of </v>

2978
01:51:13.291 --> 01:51:15.211
<v Speaker 4>different things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the whole house was just stacks of </v>

2979
01:51:15.211 --> 01:51:15.820
<v Speaker 4>boxes and no one knew anything and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>never anything valuable.</v>

2980
01:51:15.820 --> 01:51:20.820
<v Speaker 4>It's usually just little.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She had a lot of money that she didn't </v>

2981
01:51:20.820 --> 01:51:21.220
<v Speaker 4>even probably know she had like $30,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>was stored in the house,</v>

2982
01:51:21.221 --> 01:51:24.490
<v Speaker 4>some some ridiculous number and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>were broke and it was really because she</v>

2983
01:51:24.491 --> 01:51:27.070
<v Speaker 4>had grown up in the recession and when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you grew up in the recession,</v>

2984
01:51:27.071 --> 01:51:28.930
<v Speaker 4>you're like constantly worried you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to run out of money,</v>

2985
01:51:29.030 --> 01:51:31.960
<v Speaker 4>can stash our parents,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and our grandparents were always like,</v>

2986
01:51:31.961 --> 01:51:32.740
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to finish that.</v>

2987
01:51:32.741 --> 01:51:35.650
<v Speaker 4>You're going to take that home.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And now this current generation is like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>everything was.</v>

2991
01:51:39.280 --> 01:51:44.280
<v Speaker 4>So she had all these fucking cans around</v>

<v Speaker 4>She had a massive aneurysm and nobody </v>

2995
01:51:50.250 --> 01:51:50.250

<v Speaker 4>Josh ortega,</v>

3004
01:52:07.541 --> 01:52:12.541
<v Speaker 4>he wrote a gears to had one point where </v>
<v Speaker 4>he was an apartment manager department </v>

<v Speaker 4>and he got a phone call that this person</v>
<v Speaker 4>had the strange fluid like that.</v>

3006
01:52:13.471 --> 01:52:14.830
<v Speaker 4>They assumed it was a sewer leak above </v>
<v Speaker 4>the rest.</v>

3007
01:52:14.831 --> 01:52:16.520
<v Speaker 4>Something like the dead person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He called it.</v>

3009
01:52:17.621 --> 01:52:19.930
<v Speaker 4>He called him like it was a cop or some </v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of cleaner guy.</v>

3010
01:52:19.970 --> 01:52:20.570
<v Speaker 4>Touch it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>smell.</v>

3011
01:52:20.571 --> 01:52:25.571
<v Speaker 4>It was like you got death above you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The guy got had died and bloated and </v>

3012
01:52:25.571 --> 01:52:26.590
<v Speaker 4>actually soaked through.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh boy.</v>

3013
01:52:26.750 --> 01:52:28.500
<v Speaker 4>And he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>once they took the body out,</v>

3014
01:52:28.510 --> 01:52:32.050
<v Speaker 4>josh actually had to clean all that out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't clean the ceiling.</v>

3015
01:52:32.051 --> 01:52:34.750
<v Speaker 4>You have to cut it out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>suck through.</v>

3016
01:52:34.900 --> 01:52:39.900
<v Speaker 4>The smell does not go away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or the wallboard leaking through the </v>

3017
01:52:39.900 --> 01:52:41.740
<v Speaker 4>wall board.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've got a body and your ceiling.</v>

3018
01:52:42.190 --> 01:52:46.070
<v Speaker 4>Would you live somewhere like a place </v>
<v Speaker 4>that somebody had been</v>

3019
01:52:46.070 --> 01:52:48.200
<v Speaker 5>murdered at?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

3020
01:52:48.290 --> 01:52:48.950
<v Speaker 5>You wouldn't?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3021
01:52:48.951 --> 01:52:50.180
<v Speaker 5>I don't think I would.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

3022
01:52:50.181 --> 01:52:53.510
<v Speaker 5>one of the reasons why I don't think I </v>
<v Speaker 5>would is I really honestly believed that</v>

3023
01:52:53.511 --> 01:52:56.840
<v Speaker 5>there's something to the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it was rupert sheldrake,</v>

3024
01:52:56.880 --> 01:53:01.880
<v Speaker 5>who's a evolutionary biologist,</v>
<v Speaker 5>had this idea that everything has some </v>

3025
01:53:01.880 --> 01:53:05.351
<v Speaker 5>sort of a memory.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I believe it was his idea that memory </v>

3026
01:53:05.351 --> 01:53:09.341
<v Speaker 5>doesn't just exist in the human mind,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that objects and things have memory </v>

3027
01:53:09.341 --> 01:53:12.941
<v Speaker 5>and the world around you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's one reason why you can come into </v>

3028
01:53:12.941 --> 01:53:13.750
<v Speaker 5>certain buildings and creepy shit has </v>
<v Speaker 5>happened there and you know,</v>

3029
01:53:14.090 --> 01:53:15.770
<v Speaker 5>people are fucking flakes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

3030
01:53:15.950 --> 01:53:17.330
<v Speaker 5>People tell you they can read their </v>
<v Speaker 5>paul,</v>

3031
01:53:17.331 --> 01:53:21.110
<v Speaker 5>your palm or I sent you a good person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of weirdos that talk crazy</v>

3032
01:53:21.111 --> 01:53:23.470
<v Speaker 5>spiritual talk,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's California,</v>

3033
01:53:23.520 --> 01:53:24.890
<v Speaker 5>there's for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

3034
01:53:24.891 --> 01:53:26.810
<v Speaker 5>Everybody out here wants to be special </v>
<v Speaker 5>without working for it,</v>

3035
01:53:27.140 --> 01:53:29.870
<v Speaker 5>but for sure there's something about </v>
<v Speaker 5>feelings.</v>

3036
01:53:30.110 --> 01:53:30.920
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's some,</v>

3037
01:53:30.940 --> 01:53:35.940
<v Speaker 5>some,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's some fields that you get for </v>

3038
01:53:35.940 --> 01:53:37.931
<v Speaker 5>some places and so many people have had </v>
<v Speaker 5>like gone into a house where someone's </v>

3039
01:53:37.931 --> 01:53:42.821
<v Speaker 5>been murdered and no one even has to </v>
<v Speaker 5>tell them and they feel terrible about </v>

3040
01:53:42.821 --> 01:53:43.100
<v Speaker 5>the house and the house has a nice </v>
<v Speaker 5>house.</v>

3041
01:53:43.310 --> 01:53:45.580
<v Speaker 5>There's been so many stories about </v>
<v Speaker 5>something like that.</v>

3042
01:53:45.590 --> 01:53:48.170
<v Speaker 5>The wallpaper is murder somebody in </v>
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

3043
01:53:48.700 --> 01:53:49.130
<v Speaker 5>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what?</v>

3044
01:53:49.220 --> 01:53:54.220
<v Speaker 5>I think ghosts aren't just.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There aren't just potentially these </v>

3045
01:53:54.220 --> 01:53:54.220
<v Speaker 5>things that exist around here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's like a memory,</v>

3046
01:53:54.220 --> 01:53:55.100
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>As far as uh,</v>

3047
01:53:55.520 --> 01:53:57.050
<v Speaker 5>there's this awesome game system shock </v>
<v Speaker 5>two.</v>

3048
01:53:57.051 --> 01:53:57.880
<v Speaker 5>Do you ever play it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3049
01:53:58.160 --> 01:54:03.160
<v Speaker 5>And they used to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they basically had these implants that </v>

3050
01:54:03.160 --> 01:54:05.111
<v Speaker 5>allowed you to see the memories that </v>
<v Speaker 5>people right before they died and he </v>

3051
01:54:05.111 --> 01:54:05.111
<v Speaker 5>come up with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>come up with.</v>

3052
01:54:05.111 --> 01:54:05.390
<v Speaker 5>IT was a great storytelling thing </v>
<v Speaker 5>because a ghost,</v>

3053
01:54:05.500 --> 01:54:06.610
<v Speaker 5>he couldn't interfere with the cuts.</v>

3054
01:54:06.650 --> 01:54:08.210
<v Speaker 5>He couldn't shoot the guy before he did </v>
<v Speaker 5>the thing.</v>

3055
01:54:08.420 --> 01:54:13.420
<v Speaker 5>You just saw the last like eight seconds</v>
<v Speaker 5>of his life play out and he came up the </v>

3056
01:54:13.420 --> 01:54:14.840
<v Speaker 5>elevator shaft and this guy in front of </v>
<v Speaker 5>you who's standing there with a shotgun,</v>

3057
01:54:14.841 --> 01:54:15.560
<v Speaker 5>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sorry,</v>

3058
01:54:15.561 --> 01:54:17.300
<v Speaker 5>you know this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the space station has gone to hell.</v>

3059
01:54:17.301 --> 01:54:18.290
<v Speaker 5>I can't deal with this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3060
01:54:18.291 --> 01:54:21.050
<v Speaker 5>lee and the kids forgive me and he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you see him put the gun in his mouth and</v>

3061
01:54:21.051 --> 01:54:22.570
<v Speaker 5>it phases out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3062
01:54:22.760 --> 01:54:27.760
<v Speaker 5>they use that throughout.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right as an amazing storytelling </v>

3063
01:54:27.760 --> 01:54:27.760
<v Speaker 5>technique.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3064
01:54:27.760 --> 01:54:27.760
<v Speaker 5>It's classic stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

3065
01:54:27.760 --> 01:54:32.040
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He brought it back to gaming right </v>

3066
01:54:32.040 --> 01:54:34.091
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you see the mario kart started that </v>

3067
01:54:34.091 --> 01:54:34.730

<v Speaker 5>Goes around the track that.</v>

3068
01:54:34.740 --> 01:54:36.020
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>

3069
01:54:36.021 --> 01:54:38.150
<v Speaker 5>That was you compete against yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3070
01:54:38.160 --> 01:54:39.260
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>exactly,</v>

3071
01:54:39.900 --> 01:54:44.900
<v Speaker 5>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And now we're all figuring out how to </v>

3072
01:54:44.900 --> 01:54:44.900
<v Speaker 5>basically have different types of events</v>
<v Speaker 5>happen online.</v>

3073
01:54:44.900 --> 01:54:44.900
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like angry birds.</v>

3074
01:54:44.900 --> 01:54:46.880
<v Speaker 5>You were saying now they're doing like </v>
<v Speaker 5>the holiday edition.</v>

3075
01:54:46.970 --> 01:54:49.460
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But they're handling it right to man.</v>

3076
01:54:49.461 --> 01:54:54.461
<v Speaker 5>Those,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those people didn't charge anything for </v>

3077
01:54:54.461 --> 01:54:54.461

<v Speaker 6>I forgot.</v>

3208
01:59:36.520 --> 01:59:37.930
<v Speaker 6>I think also many people are forgot.</v>

3209
01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.600
<v Speaker 7>They compile it on the huffington post </v>
<v Speaker 7>once in a while you just look at it just</v>

3210
01:59:40.601 --> 01:59:41.960
<v Speaker 7>to go through just like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this is amazing.</v>

3211
01:59:41.961 --> 01:59:46.961
<v Speaker 7>There's so many things that are just so </v>
<v Speaker 7>crazy that are unmissed not even </v>

3212
01:59:46.961 --> 01:59:49.601
<v Speaker 7>understood about this world.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The whole lake arsenic based life form </v>

3213
01:59:49.601 --> 01:59:49.601
<v Speaker 7>stuff they came up with.</v>

3214
01:59:49.601 --> 01:59:51.150
<v Speaker 6>I know what they found out that that was</v>
<v Speaker 6>bad science.</v>

3215
01:59:51.210 --> 01:59:51.840
<v Speaker 6>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3216
01:59:51.841 --> 01:59:56.841
<v Speaker 6>That was very poorly written and that </v>
<v Speaker 6>nasa nasa rushed to try to get this </v>

3217
01:59:56.841 --> 02:00:01.491
<v Speaker 6>press conference or this press release </v>
<v Speaker 6>out there before it got reviewed by all </v>

3218
02:00:01.711 --> 02:00:06.711
<v Speaker 6>the right people and there's a ton of </v>
<v Speaker 6>criticism all over the internet that </v>

3219
02:00:06.711 --> 02:00:10.881
<v Speaker 6>what they did was they drew some really </v>
<v Speaker 6>unscientific conclusions and and kind of</v>

3220
02:00:11.191 --> 02:00:12.390
<v Speaker 6>a.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not,</v>

3221
02:00:12.420 --> 02:00:15.150
<v Speaker 6>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not disproven completely,</v>

3222
02:00:15.360 --> 02:00:16.990
<v Speaker 6>but it's not proven either.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a,</v>

3223
02:00:17.220 --> 02:00:20.910
<v Speaker 6>it's not ready yet and it's kind of like</v>
<v Speaker 6>contact where they're not really sure if</v>

3224
02:00:20.911 --> 02:00:22.550
<v Speaker 6>jodie foster really went to the other </v>
<v Speaker 6>world,</v>

3225
02:00:22.600 --> 02:00:23.910
<v Speaker 6>some nutty shit going on.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Man.</v>

3226
02:00:23.911 --> 02:00:26.430
<v Speaker 6>Have you heard about this new object </v>
<v Speaker 6>that they found outside of pluto?</v>

3227
02:00:26.431 --> 02:00:30.240
<v Speaker 6>That's jupiter sized really just out of </v>
<v Speaker 6>nowhere way the fuck out there,</v>

3228
02:00:30.241 --> 02:00:35.241
<v Speaker 6>like probably as far or more from </v>
<v Speaker 6>jupiter as we are from jupiter or excuse</v>

3229
02:00:35.401 --> 02:00:40.401
<v Speaker 6>me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>from pluto rather as we are from pluto </v>

3230
02:00:40.401 --> 02:00:40.500
<v Speaker 6>and it's outside of pluto and it's </v>
<v Speaker 6>gigantic.</v>

3231
02:00:40.860 --> 02:00:43.440
<v Speaker 6>They don't know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They have no idea where it is exactly,</v>

3232
02:00:43.441 --> 02:00:44.540
<v Speaker 6>but they know there's something out </v>
<v Speaker 6>there.</v>

3233
02:00:44.570 --> 02:00:46.950
<v Speaker 6>They're pretty sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I knOw you've probably talked about this</v>

3234
02:00:46.951 --> 02:00:48.050
<v Speaker 6>in the area because you're big on aliens</v>
<v Speaker 6>to.</v>

3235
02:00:48.060 --> 02:00:49.730
<v Speaker 6>The whole idea with Stephen hawking was </v>
<v Speaker 6>saying like,</v>

3236
02:00:49.880 --> 02:00:51.990
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if aliens actually find us first,</v>

3237
02:00:51.991 --> 02:00:56.991
<v Speaker 6>then it's going to be a situation where </v>
<v Speaker 6>were the native americans and then it's </v>

3238
02:00:56.991 --> 02:00:57.270
<v Speaker 6>everybody else coming over from europe.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It didn't turn out very well.</v>

3239
02:00:57.330 --> 02:01:00.030
<v Speaker 6>or were monkeys were not even native </v>
<v Speaker 6>americans.</v>

3240
02:01:00.031 --> 02:01:01.980
<v Speaker 6>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>native americans released human,</v>

3241
02:01:02.140 --> 02:01:07.140
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean if something is a million years </v>

3242
02:01:07.140 --> 02:01:09.111
<v Speaker 6>more advanced than us,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's going to be like us collecting </v>

3243
02:01:09.111 --> 02:01:09.111
<v Speaker 6>bugs.</v>
<v Speaker 6>LIke again,</v>

3244
02:01:09.111 --> 02:01:12.661
<v Speaker 6>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>your kids are probably going to live to </v>

3245
02:01:12.661 --> 02:01:12.661
<v Speaker 6>be 150 plus to see this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If not,</v>

3246
02:01:13.350 --> 02:01:14.790
<v Speaker 6>if not you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Who knows?</v>

3247
02:01:14.791 --> 02:01:16.710
<v Speaker 6>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>who knows what the fuck is going on,</v>

3248
02:01:16.960 --> 02:01:19.200
<v Speaker 6>the breakthroughs that they're coming in</v>
<v Speaker 6>to live to 1:50</v>

3249
02:01:19.201 --> 02:01:22.020
<v Speaker 6>working in video games.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Would you stress?</v>

3250
02:01:22.620 --> 02:01:27.620
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Maybe we'll just kick back and go jay z </v>

3251
02:01:27.620 --> 02:01:27.630
<v Speaker 6>style.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Once you compile all your money,</v>

3252
02:01:27.670 --> 02:01:28.360
<v Speaker 6>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 6>dude,</v>

3253
02:01:28.760 --> 02:01:32.220
<v Speaker 6>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because the developers,</v>

3254
02:01:32.370 --> 02:01:37.370
<v Speaker 6>the people who have the money or the </v>
<v Speaker 6>people that put up the money and those </v>

3255
02:01:37.370 --> 02:01:40.341
<v Speaker 6>are the people that make all the money's</v>
<v Speaker 6>at what's going on and that it's much </v>

3256
02:01:40.341 --> 02:01:40.341
<v Speaker 6>harder for the developers to go jz </v>
<v Speaker 6>style.</v>

3257
02:01:40.400 --> 02:01:41.390
<v Speaker 7>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3258
02:01:41.550 --> 02:01:41.960
<v Speaker 7>You get.</v>
<v Speaker 7>WeLl,</v>

3259
02:01:41.961 --> 02:01:46.961
<v Speaker 7>you get to the point where it's.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's so hard for one person to really </v>

3260
02:01:46.961 --> 02:01:47.000
<v Speaker 7>break out and do his own thing,</v>
<v Speaker 7>especially in the triple a space because</v>

3261
02:01:47.240 --> 02:01:52.240
<v Speaker 7>you're seeing where it used games and </v>
<v Speaker 7>rentals are eating up so much of the </v>

3262
02:01:52.240 --> 02:01:52.690
<v Speaker 7>market that for somebody to spend,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3263
02:01:52.691 --> 02:01:55.310
<v Speaker 7>millions millions of dollars to make a </v>
<v Speaker 7>game and that to actually launch it with</v>

3264
02:01:55.311 --> 02:02:00.311
<v Speaker 7>all the marketing is a huge risk.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then so a lot of people are turning </v>

3265
02:02:00.311 --> 02:02:00.311
<v Speaker 7>to mobile that running to all these </v>
<v Speaker 7>different kinds of places.</v>

3266
02:02:00.311 --> 02:02:04.751
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>But I would think that at a certain </v>

3267
02:02:04.751 --> 02:02:04.751
<v Speaker 7>level,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like your level,</v>

3268
02:02:04.751 --> 02:02:05.780
<v Speaker 7>when you have a certain reputation </v>
<v Speaker 7>behind you,</v>

3269
02:02:05.960 --> 02:02:09.860
<v Speaker 7>that it might be easier for a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 7>people to come to you and say,</v>

3270
02:02:09.861 --> 02:02:11.720
<v Speaker 7>listen man,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're a proven commodity.</v>

3271
02:02:11.721 --> 02:02:13.520
<v Speaker 7>Why don't you get your team and you </v>
<v Speaker 7>know,</v>

3272
02:02:13.521 --> 02:02:16.120
<v Speaker 7>we'll give you guys a cut of the </v>
<v Speaker 7>publishing hypothetical.</v>

3273
02:02:16.130 --> 02:02:21.130
<v Speaker 7>I knew what he did an early age that by </v>
<v Speaker 7>doing the pr and being able to have a </v>

3274
02:02:21.130 --> 02:02:24.401
<v Speaker 7>little bit of a theater background and </v>
<v Speaker 7>go on stage and this stuff would get me </v>

3275
02:02:24.401 --> 02:02:24.401
<v Speaker 7>a certain amount of leverage and then by</v>
<v Speaker 7>working with talented people,</v>

3276
02:02:24.401 --> 02:02:26.330
<v Speaker 7>making great games,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I have built a brand for myself.</v>

3277
02:02:26.840 --> 02:02:31.840
<v Speaker 7>So hypothetically I could probably go </v>
<v Speaker 7>knock on a lot of publishers toward to </v>

3278
02:02:31.840 --> 02:02:31.840
<v Speaker 7>mom and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>just give me a bunch of money.</v>

3279
02:02:31.840 --> 02:02:31.910
<v Speaker 7>Let me build a team,</v>
<v Speaker 7>do whatever I want.</v>

3280
02:02:32.300 --> 02:02:36.440
<v Speaker 7>The problem is epic takes good care of </v>
<v Speaker 7>me and I worked with everybody and I get</v>

3281
02:02:36.441 --> 02:02:39.800
<v Speaker 7>to do the shit I want and I know I've </v>
<v Speaker 7>got a great setup,</v>

3282
02:02:39.801 --> 02:02:42.560
<v Speaker 7>so why fuck with it for something that </v>
<v Speaker 7>may or may not work out.</v>

3283
02:02:42.561 --> 02:02:47.561
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That explosion was brian fucking around </v>

3284
02:02:47.561 --> 02:02:49.911
<v Speaker 7>in the background.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What do you think that the world's </v>

3285
02:02:49.911 --> 02:02:49.911
<v Speaker 7>coming to an end.</v>

3286
02:02:49.911 --> 02:02:50.930
<v Speaker 7>What do you think the current,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a lifespan of the consoles are?</v>

3287
02:02:50.931 --> 02:02:53.720
<v Speaker 7>Leg until the new year?</v>
<v Speaker 7>We have for the first time ever in video</v>

3288
02:02:53.721 --> 02:02:58.721
<v Speaker 7>games,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we've just gotten past the five year </v>

3289
02:02:58.721 --> 02:02:58.721
<v Speaker 7>lifecycle.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3290
02:02:58.721 --> 02:03:00.560
<v Speaker 7>It seems reason yet is I think for a lot</v>
<v Speaker 7>of people graphics or quote good enough.</v>

3291
02:03:00.620 --> 02:03:01.370
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right,</v>

3292
02:03:01.371 --> 02:03:03.860
<v Speaker 7>and like what if,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if you were to put something new on tv,</v>

3293
02:03:03.861 --> 02:03:07.220
<v Speaker 7>that's what is the current state of the </v>
<v Speaker 7>art versus the latest playstation.</v>

3294
02:03:07.280 --> 02:03:10.280
<v Speaker 7>Xbox game would've passed the mom test,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which your mom look at that and go,</v>

3295
02:03:10.281 --> 02:03:11.990
<v Speaker 7>that looks amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Compare to that.</v>

3296
02:03:12.320 --> 02:03:14.030
<v Speaker 7>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Maybe not give it a couple of years.</v>

3297
02:03:14.031 --> 02:03:15.170
<v Speaker 7>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

3298
02:03:15.171 --> 02:03:17.570
<v Speaker 7>So right now maybe it's good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

3299
02:03:17.571 --> 02:03:19.340
<v Speaker 7>you have all the emotion controls and </v>
<v Speaker 7>everything like that.</v>

3300
02:03:19.341 --> 02:03:20.750
<v Speaker 7>They can kind of keep everybody </v>
<v Speaker 7>occupied.</v>

3301
02:03:20.870 --> 02:03:25.870
<v Speaker 7>What do you think the next thing is?</v>
<v Speaker 7>What do you think is just going to be </v>

3302
02:03:25.870 --> 02:03:25.870
<v Speaker 7>faster and bigger?</v>

3303
02:03:25.870 --> 02:03:27.230
<v Speaker 7>Or do you think there's going to be the </v>
<v Speaker 7>personally.</v>

3304
02:03:27.231 --> 02:03:28.400
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>my personal opinion,</v>

3305
02:03:28.401 --> 02:03:30.290
<v Speaker 7>personal opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 7>fastest hell,</v>

3306
02:03:30.291 --> 02:03:32.990
<v Speaker 7>avatar style graphics,</v>
<v Speaker 7>avatar level of graphics,</v>

3307
02:03:33.590 --> 02:03:35.600
<v Speaker 7>something that is always connected to </v>
<v Speaker 7>the internet.</v>

3308
02:03:35.780 --> 02:03:38.660
<v Speaker 7>Is it ever going to come to a time where</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's easier to do than it is now?</v>

3309
02:03:39.090 --> 02:03:40.820
<v Speaker 7>What?</v>
<v Speaker 7>In regards to building the log,</v>

3310
02:03:40.821 --> 02:03:42.050
<v Speaker 7>building it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>creating it,</v>

3311
02:03:42.140 --> 02:03:47.140
<v Speaker 7>I mean there's things like that will,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's ways that you can procedurally </v>

3312
02:03:47.140 --> 02:03:47.140
<v Speaker 7>create content,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

3313
02:03:47.140 --> 02:03:51.851
<v Speaker 7>Like we'll write it spore where like a </v>
<v Speaker 7>lot of the textures were automatically </v>

3314
02:03:51.851 --> 02:03:54.100
<v Speaker 7>created so we figured out what like a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>an algorithm would be for grass and wood</v>

3315
02:03:54.101 --> 02:03:56.660
<v Speaker 7>and things like that and there's a huge,</v>
<v Speaker 7>not huge,</v>

3316
02:03:56.661 --> 02:03:58.760
<v Speaker 7>but there's a subset of people that are </v>
<v Speaker 7>working that technology like,</v>

3317
02:03:58.761 --> 02:04:03.761
<v Speaker 7>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>just hit a button and just generate 50 </v>

3318
02:04:03.761 --> 02:04:03.761
<v Speaker 7>types of wood for me so we don't </v>
<v Speaker 7>actually have to build it.</v>

3319
02:04:03.761 --> 02:04:07.330
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Then you get to the point where there's </v>

3320
02:04:07.330 --> 02:04:08.681
<v Speaker 7>a certain library of do I really need to</v>
<v Speaker 7>remodel the couch for the 8000000000th </v>

3321
02:04:08.681 --> 02:04:08.681
<v Speaker 7>time?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like work smarter,</v>

3322
02:04:08.681 --> 02:04:08.681
<v Speaker 7>not harder,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

3323
02:04:08.681 --> 02:04:10.430
<v Speaker 7>Figure out ways to use more modular </v>
<v Speaker 7>architecture.</v>

3324
02:04:10.610 --> 02:04:12.550
<v Speaker 7>Do you really need 50 columns of </v>
<v Speaker 7>different types of.</v>

3325
02:04:12.551 --> 02:04:13.880
<v Speaker 7>You can just spit them all out,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

3326
02:04:14.150 --> 02:04:15.360
<v Speaker 7>The key is going to be figuring out,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3327
02:04:15.361 --> 02:04:19.580
<v Speaker 7>like how to craft that within a certain </v>
<v Speaker 7>financial model.</v>

3328
02:04:19.880 --> 02:04:22.760
<v Speaker 7>That's the billion dollar question.</v>
<v Speaker 7>How do you put that aaa content.</v>

3329
02:04:22.761 --> 02:04:23.510
<v Speaker 7>That makes sense,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

3330
02:04:23.511 --> 02:04:28.511
<v Speaker 7>Like hoW do you remain profitable?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Will there eventually you think will be </v>

3331
02:04:28.511 --> 02:04:31.390
<v Speaker 7>software that makes it easy?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like the average person can create </v>

3332
02:04:31.390 --> 02:04:31.390
<v Speaker 7>games.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's what we do.</v>

3333
02:04:31.390 --> 02:04:33.950
<v Speaker 7>That's half of our business.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You could go to utk.com</v>

3334
02:04:33.951 --> 02:04:38.951
<v Speaker 7>and download the same exact stuff we </v>
<v Speaker 7>used to build our games for free so </v>

3335
02:04:38.951 --> 02:04:42.861
<v Speaker 7>anybody can for free,</v>
<v Speaker 7>go and take your technology and make </v>

3336
02:04:42.861 --> 02:04:42.861
<v Speaker 7>their own game.</v>

3337
02:04:42.861 --> 02:04:47.510
<v Speaker 7>They can.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The problem is of course if you start </v>

3338
02:04:47.510 --> 02:04:50.061
<v Speaker 7>making money with it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>then you have to talk to us about </v>

3339
02:04:50.061 --> 02:04:50.061
<v Speaker 7>officially licensing it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

3340
02:04:50.061 --> 02:04:51.990
<v Speaker 7>that's pretty funny actually,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but the reason why,</v>

3341
02:04:52.170 --> 02:04:57.170
<v Speaker 7>the reason why the smart is because you </v>
<v Speaker 7>have so many college campuses out there </v>

3342
02:04:57.170 --> 02:05:00.741
<v Speaker 7>that want to find a solution.</v>
<v Speaker 7>How do we train college kids to learn </v>

3343
02:05:00.741 --> 02:05:00.850
<v Speaker 7>how to use this technology that goes to </v>
<v Speaker 7>it?</v>

3344
02:05:00.950 --> 02:05:04.950
<v Speaker 7>Is it how hard your builder to builder </v>
<v Speaker 7>or killed for these tools?</v>

3345
02:05:04.951 --> 02:05:06.750
<v Speaker 7>When I was 13?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yes.</v>

3346
02:05:06.930 --> 02:05:08.790
<v Speaker 7>Now they're not making games hard.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

3347
02:05:08.791 --> 02:05:11.190
<v Speaker 7>Like you still have to know what to do,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but if I was myself,</v>

3348
02:05:11.191 --> 02:05:16.191
<v Speaker 7>17,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I would've been able to do such crazy </v>

3349
02:05:16.191 --> 02:05:16.191
<v Speaker 7>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like I had to learn visual basic and get</v>

3350
02:05:16.191 --> 02:05:16.920
<v Speaker 7>a programmer.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're the programmer.</v>

3351
02:05:16.921 --> 02:05:21.921
<v Speaker 7>I did jazz jack rabbit with back in the </v>
<v Speaker 7>day is the guy who works in kill zone </v>

3352
02:05:21.921 --> 02:05:21.921
<v Speaker 7>now.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's just one of those weird like,</v>

3353
02:05:21.921 --> 02:05:23.490
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>professor x mag needle type situations.</v>

3354
02:05:23.491 --> 02:05:24.660
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>But he's cool guy,</v>

3357
02:05:27.781 --> 02:05:32.781
<v Speaker 7>start building games.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So I get these kids a tweet all the </v>

3358
02:05:32.781 --> 02:05:32.781
<v Speaker 7>time.</v>
<v Speaker 7>How do we get the business?</v>

3359
02:05:32.781 --> 02:05:32.781
<v Speaker 7>How do we get the business?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm like,</v>

3360
02:05:32.781 --> 02:05:36.501
<v Speaker 7>go to utk,</v>
<v Speaker 7>download it and start building </v>

3361
02:05:36.501 --> 02:05:38.241
<v Speaker 7>something,</v>
<v Speaker 7>figure out what you're good at and work </v>

3362
02:05:38.241 --> 02:05:38.241
<v Speaker 7>your ass off and be better than </v>
<v Speaker 7>everybody else.</v>

3363
02:05:38.241 --> 02:05:39.380
<v Speaker 7>I've been playing that hard shaft.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean</v>

3364
02:05:39.730 --> 02:05:44.730
<v Speaker 1>mineshaft game that's on the slip there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian king called big black dog,</v>

3365
02:05:48.790 --> 02:05:50.800
<v Speaker 1>king kong and it was great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's minecraft,</v>

3366
02:05:50.801 --> 02:05:51.600
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3367
02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:57.000
<v Speaker 1>so have you been playing that at all?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard they think it's the first pc </v>

3368
02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:57.000
<v Speaker 1>game I paid money for and years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

3369
02:05:57.000 --> 02:06:00.740
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we got through this whole episode </v>

3370
02:06:00.740 --> 02:06:03.031
<v Speaker 1>without anybody talking about big bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a horrible slip.</v>

3371
02:06:03.240 --> 02:06:06.190
<v Speaker 1>It was like one of those big black dicks</v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

3372
02:06:06.191 --> 02:06:09.940
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like it's impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's embedded into our system.</v>

3373
02:06:10.330 --> 02:06:15.330
<v Speaker 1>We track dick talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've through the black car and so mine </v>

3374
02:06:16.291 --> 02:06:16.930
<v Speaker 1>shaft,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do I.</v>

3375
02:06:16.960 --> 02:06:21.960
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go from people at cox to </v>

3376
02:06:21.960 --> 02:06:21.960
<v Speaker 1>minecraft,</v>
<v Speaker 1>minecraft game.</v>

3377
02:06:21.960 --> 02:06:22.520
<v Speaker 1>joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this kid,</v>

3378
02:06:22.530 --> 02:06:27.530
<v Speaker 1>this kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this kid decided to make this game out </v>

3379
02:06:27.530 --> 02:06:27.530
<v Speaker 1>of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of</v>

3380
02:06:27.530 --> 02:06:28.550
<v Speaker 7>his garage.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And he's making god I hipaa,</v>

3381
02:06:28.610 --> 02:06:30.620
<v Speaker 7>I don't even know the numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He's making money hand over fist,</v>

3382
02:06:30.640 --> 02:06:35.640
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>And it's basically a world where you </v>

3383
02:06:35.640 --> 02:06:35.640
<v Speaker 7>can,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you,</v>

3384
02:06:35.640 --> 02:06:35.640
<v Speaker 7>you initially start off and you can </v>
<v Speaker 7>build cubes at different,</v>

3385
02:06:35.640 --> 02:06:38.450
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>materials in front of you and then build</v>

3386
02:06:38.451 --> 02:06:43.451
<v Speaker 7>anything you want basically.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So imagine building three d pixels and </v>

3387
02:06:43.451 --> 02:06:43.451
<v Speaker 7>there's people who have built like the </v>
<v Speaker 7>earth in this game,</v>

3388
02:06:43.451 --> 02:06:43.580
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

3389
02:06:43.850 --> 02:06:48.850
<v Speaker 7>And then there's this mode where the </v>
<v Speaker 7>nighttime comes and you have to </v>

3390
02:06:48.850 --> 02:06:49.050
<v Speaker 7>eventually figure out how to survive </v>
<v Speaker 7>your first night and start building like</v>

3391
02:06:49.100 --> 02:06:50.930
<v Speaker 7>a workbench and built all these </v>
<v Speaker 7>different things.</v>

3392
02:06:50.931 --> 02:06:53.570
<v Speaker 7>And it starts getting deeper and deeper.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I haven't gotten too deep into it,</v>

3393
02:06:53.571 --> 02:06:58.571
<v Speaker 7>but it's become this kind of phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He's talking to valve about doing </v>

3394
02:06:58.571 --> 02:07:00.881
<v Speaker 7>something with it and what you see right</v>
<v Speaker 7>now is these kind of little micro </v>

3395
02:07:00.881 --> 02:07:00.881
<v Speaker 7>developers who are having success.</v>

3396
02:07:00.881 --> 02:07:02.450
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The guy who did brave jonathan blow,</v>

3397
02:07:02.451 --> 02:07:07.451
<v Speaker 7>you have the team who made portal was </v>
<v Speaker 7>like a handful of kids who made an </v>

3398
02:07:07.451 --> 02:07:08.210
<v Speaker 7>independent game that then they started </v>
<v Speaker 7>working with valve.</v>

3399
02:07:08.211 --> 02:07:09.530
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The guy who did the limbo,</v>

3400
02:07:09.531 --> 02:07:14.531
<v Speaker 7>the team into the limbo.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They were at the independent games </v>

3401
02:07:14.531 --> 02:07:14.531
<v Speaker 7>festival.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We saw that and were like,</v>

3402
02:07:14.531 --> 02:07:17.471
<v Speaker 7>this game is great,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and then every time I'd love supporting </v>

3403
02:07:17.471 --> 02:07:19.961
<v Speaker 7>these indie kids because you never know </v>
<v Speaker 7>like what's going to come out of them </v>

3404
02:07:19.961 --> 02:07:21.520
<v Speaker 7>because they can often take risks that </v>
<v Speaker 7>we can't because you know,</v>

3405
02:07:21.530 --> 02:07:22.940
<v Speaker 7>in their garage and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3406
02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:28.000
<v Speaker 7>bill,</v>
<v Speaker 7>would it be for someone to make a movie </v>

3407
02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:28.000
<v Speaker 7>with your game engine?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Pretty easy.</v>

3408
02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:28.000
<v Speaker 7>Real,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>

3409
02:07:28.210 --> 02:07:29.150
<v Speaker 7>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3410
02:07:29.960 --> 02:07:31.480
<v Speaker 7>They call it machinima.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh yeah.</v>

3411
02:07:31.650 --> 02:07:36.650
<v Speaker 7>Mastermind.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm going to the award ceremony where </v>

3412
02:07:36.650 --> 02:07:36.650
<v Speaker 7>they call it spelled.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I always call it</v>

3413
02:07:36.650 --> 02:07:39.100
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't know the art of,</v>

3414
02:07:39.130 --> 02:07:39.900
<v Speaker 4>of readmission.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Machinima.</v>

3415
02:07:40.270 --> 02:07:41.710
<v Speaker 4>It's the art of a virtual camera,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3416
02:07:41.711 --> 02:07:43.030
<v Speaker 4>That's a c,</v>
<v Speaker 4>h I,</v>

3417
02:07:46.270 --> 02:07:47.750
<v Speaker 4>m a s,</v>
<v Speaker 4>s,</v>

3418
02:07:48.420 --> 02:07:49.900
<v Speaker 4>s,</v>
<v Speaker 4>l I t dot.</v>

3419
02:07:50.440 --> 02:07:53.890
<v Speaker 4>I've seen some old ones done with old </v>
<v Speaker 4>game engines that looked really hokey.</v>

3420
02:07:53.920 --> 02:07:55.480
<v Speaker 4>That was good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the game engines of today,</v>

3421
02:07:55.481 --> 02:07:57.610
<v Speaker 4>they're so sophisticated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was what red vs blue was,</v>

3422
02:07:57.611 --> 02:08:02.611
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was that whole web series that </v>

3423
02:08:02.611 --> 02:08:02.611
<v Speaker 4>became huge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These guys,</v>

3424
02:08:02.611 --> 02:08:05.430
<v Speaker 4>little characters and they just made </v>
<v Speaker 4>them target these incredibly funny </v>

3425
02:08:05.430 --> 02:08:07.580
<v Speaker 4>situations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You need to have a sitcom of your </v>

3426
02:08:07.580 --> 02:08:07.580
<v Speaker 4>character's having wives and stuff in </v>
<v Speaker 4>that forum.</v>

3427
02:08:07.580 --> 02:08:09.070
<v Speaker 4>We will absolutely do that in our spare </v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

3428
02:08:09.330 --> 02:08:09.840
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

3429
02:08:10.260 --> 02:08:15.260
<v Speaker 4>He just hired two speed iphone efforts </v>
<v Speaker 4>and high school kids to do it.</v>

3430
02:08:15.571 --> 02:08:20.571
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the marine guys pulling their </v>

3431
02:08:20.571 --> 02:08:24.610
<v Speaker 4>assholes apart and the goats,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he posed no beauty of so many of those </v>

3432
02:08:24.791 --> 02:08:25.240
<v Speaker 4>internet memes.</v>

3433
02:08:25.240 --> 02:08:27.130
<v Speaker 4>Just I could sit there eating a giant </v>
<v Speaker 4>bowl of cereal,</v>

3434
02:08:27.131 --> 02:08:29.950
<v Speaker 4>just watch it and not even care because </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's been sent to you so many times.</v>

3435
02:08:29.970 --> 02:08:31.630
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's true,</v>

3436
02:08:31.930 --> 02:08:32.870
<v Speaker 4>and that's the other thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3437
02:08:32.890 --> 02:08:37.890
<v Speaker 4>we were talking about kids getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>freaked out by all the input that they </v>

3438
02:08:37.890 --> 02:08:39.280
<v Speaker 4>have today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're just going to get desensitized a</v>

3439
02:08:39.281 --> 02:08:41.170
<v Speaker 4>little quicker than us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you can handle it,</v>

3440
02:08:41.180 --> 02:08:43.300
<v Speaker 4>the kids can handle it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just gonna be trickier,</v>

3441
02:08:43.910 --> 02:08:48.910
<v Speaker 4>trickier in the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I will tell you bringing it full </v>

3442
02:08:48.910 --> 02:08:48.910
<v Speaker 4>circle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like every time I see real life,</v>

3443
02:08:48.910 --> 02:08:48.910
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3444
02:08:48.910 --> 02:08:50.200
<v Speaker 4>violence in front of you see somebody </v>
<v Speaker 4>get hit at a bar.</v>

3445
02:08:50.220 --> 02:08:53.890
<v Speaker 4>It makes me nauseous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My problem is I'm so used to it.</v>

3446
02:08:54.310 --> 02:08:56.050
<v Speaker 4>I see people get beat up and it's so </v>
<v Speaker 4>normal.</v>

3447
02:08:56.590 --> 02:09:00.610
<v Speaker 4>My wife cut her head and she opened up </v>
<v Speaker 4>the back of her car,</v>

3448
02:09:00.650 --> 02:09:02.500
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the hood and banged her head on it.</v>

3449
02:09:02.500 --> 02:09:05.000
<v Speaker 4>She accidentally the skull but bled.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3450
02:09:05.050 --> 02:09:06.790
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't that bad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it started bleeding because I talked</v>

3451
02:09:06.791 --> 02:09:07.710
<v Speaker 4>about this already.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3452
02:09:07.780 --> 02:09:11.950
<v Speaker 4>it started bleeding and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just looked at a cut for her.</v>

3453
02:09:11.951 --> 02:09:13.960
<v Speaker 4>I was like this traumatic thing and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3454
02:09:13.961 --> 02:09:17.020
<v Speaker 4>they're not even gonna stop this fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is nothing to tap on this.</v>

3455
02:09:17.160 --> 02:09:18.840
<v Speaker 4>This is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is barely cut.</v>

3456
02:09:18.910 --> 02:09:21.850
<v Speaker 4>Like there's only one inpatient wounds </v>
<v Speaker 4>bleed a lot and I'm like thinking shit,</v>

3457
02:09:21.851 --> 02:09:23.770
<v Speaker 4>I might have to take her to the hospital</v>
<v Speaker 4>for this little baby cut.</v>

3458
02:09:23.800 --> 02:09:28.800
<v Speaker 4>And she's gonna freak out if she gonna </v>
<v Speaker 4>let me stick like crazy glue in there </v>

3459
02:09:28.800 --> 02:09:28.800
<v Speaker 4>and glue it together because that's what</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would do.</v>

3460
02:09:28.800 --> 02:09:29.380
<v Speaker 4>Those my head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd be like,</v>

3461
02:09:29.381 --> 02:09:32.960
<v Speaker 4>just drop some crazy shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

3462
02:09:33.070 --> 02:09:35.350
<v Speaker 4>Crying you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pansy cuts when you get cut,</v>

3463
02:09:35.410 --> 02:09:40.410
<v Speaker 4>they put crazy glue on it and push it </v>
<v Speaker 4>together with the little one gets put </v>

3464
02:09:40.410 --> 02:09:40.410
<v Speaker 4>some vinegar on.</v>

3465
02:09:40.410 --> 02:09:45.180
<v Speaker 4>My point is I'm so used to trauma,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm so used to like dudes getting </v>

3466
02:09:45.180 --> 02:09:46.540
<v Speaker 4>punched in the face and you have that </v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of fighting,</v>

3467
02:09:46.720 --> 02:09:51.720
<v Speaker 4>bringing constantly do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And again it comes back to boston once </v>

3468
02:09:51.720 --> 02:09:52.030
<v Speaker 4>there's that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's also working for the ufc for</v>

3469
02:09:52.031 --> 02:09:55.600
<v Speaker 4>over a thousand fights being three feet </v>
<v Speaker 4>away from these murderers,</v>

3470
02:09:55.810 --> 02:09:58.720
<v Speaker 4>these fucking trained killers punting </v>
<v Speaker 4>each other in their head.</v>

3471
02:09:58.990 --> 02:10:01.480
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen so many dudes just get fucking</v>

3472
02:10:01.550 --> 02:10:02.470
<v Speaker 4>flatlined.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's,</v>

3473
02:10:02.490 --> 02:10:07.490
<v Speaker 4>what's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's the lifespan of a fighter with </v>

3474
02:10:07.490 --> 02:10:07.490
<v Speaker 4>the amount of head damage?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything,</v>

3475
02:10:07.490 --> 02:10:07.490
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a good question.</v>

3476
02:10:07.490 --> 02:10:08.430
<v Speaker 4>I don't think we know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying lifespan.</v>

3477
02:10:08.440 --> 02:10:13.440
<v Speaker 4>I'm saying as far as like how long can </v>
<v Speaker 4>you actually fight before it starts to </v>

3478
02:10:13.440 --> 02:10:13.440
<v Speaker 4>come in?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you seen,</v>

3479
02:10:13.440 --> 02:10:13.810
<v Speaker 4>have you seen that it becomes like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>visible issue,</v>

3480
02:10:13.811 --> 02:10:15.460
<v Speaker 4>like you start to see things get a </v>
<v Speaker 4>little off?</v>

3481
02:10:15.520 --> 02:10:20.520
<v Speaker 4>I have seen guys go from being </v>
<v Speaker 4>absolutely normal to absolutely not </v>

3482
02:10:20.520 --> 02:10:21.340
<v Speaker 4>normal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>absolutely normal to frightening.</v>

3483
02:10:21.370 --> 02:10:23.260
<v Speaker 4>I've seen that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen the full spectrum.</v>

3484
02:10:23.370 --> 02:10:28.370
<v Speaker 4>That's very shocking and I've seen also </v>
<v Speaker 4>also guys like randy coture who get out </v>

3485
02:10:28.370 --> 02:10:29.620
<v Speaker 4>of it with not a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not a single problem,</v>

3486
02:10:29.920 --> 02:10:33.290
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and randy is so super lucid,</v>

3487
02:10:33.320 --> 02:10:34.010
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you talked to</v>

3488
02:10:34.010 --> 02:10:35.060
<v Speaker 6>him,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's very intelligent,</v>

3489
02:10:35.061 --> 02:10:37.160
<v Speaker 6>very aware and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and he's been,</v>

3490
02:10:37.190 --> 02:10:42.190
<v Speaker 6>he's been knocked out a couple of times.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's recognized how to build the brand </v>

3491
02:10:42.190 --> 02:10:42.190
<v Speaker 6>though,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3492
02:10:42.190 --> 02:10:42.710
<v Speaker 6>Well it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's a smart guy.</v>

3493
02:10:42.711 --> 02:10:44.780
<v Speaker 6>He doesn't take unnecessary punishment.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Some guys,</v>

3494
02:10:44.990 --> 02:10:47.810
<v Speaker 6>they try to be more exciting so they'll </v>
<v Speaker 6>take unnecessary punishment.</v>

3495
02:10:47.811 --> 02:10:48.380
<v Speaker 6>They'll,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they'll,</v>

3496
02:10:48.770 --> 02:10:53.770
<v Speaker 6>they won't fight strategically.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They'll fight like in an aggressive </v>

3497
02:10:53.770 --> 02:10:55.310
<v Speaker 6>style and an attempt to overwhelm this </v>
<v Speaker 6>person with their physicality.</v>

3498
02:10:55.580 --> 02:10:56.690
<v Speaker 6>And when you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3499
02:10:56.691 --> 02:10:58.520
<v Speaker 6>it makes for an exciting fight for the </v>
<v Speaker 6>fans,</v>

3500
02:10:58.820 --> 02:11:03.820
<v Speaker 6>but it's very dangerous for you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's very danger for your long term </v>

3501
02:11:03.820 --> 02:11:04.470
<v Speaker 6>mental health.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's a management issue.</v>

3502
02:11:04.590 --> 02:11:09.590
<v Speaker 6>You'd assume that demIng fighters have </v>
<v Speaker 6>their managers who kind of advise them </v>

3503
02:11:09.590 --> 02:11:09.590
<v Speaker 6>on these impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can't tell a guy what to do.</v>

3504
02:11:09.680 --> 02:11:11.630
<v Speaker 6>There's no way he's going to not going </v>
<v Speaker 6>to listen to you.</v>

3505
02:11:11.631 --> 02:11:11.870
<v Speaker 6>If he's.</v>

3506
02:11:11.870 --> 02:11:16.870
<v Speaker 6>The guy wears his underwear when he gets</v>
<v Speaker 6>in that fucking cage and they shut that </v>

3507
02:11:16.870 --> 02:11:16.870
<v Speaker 6>door.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's not gonna.</v>

3508
02:11:16.870 --> 02:11:16.870
<v Speaker 6>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

3509
02:11:16.870 --> 02:11:21.140
<v Speaker 6>Fighters will take.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They'll take direction as far as </v>

3510
02:11:21.140 --> 02:11:23.681
<v Speaker 6>coaching.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They'll take direction as far as </v>

3511
02:11:23.681 --> 02:11:23.681
<v Speaker 6>technique.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They'll take direction as far as,</v>

3512
02:11:23.681 --> 02:11:27.401
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they have a guy that they really trust </v>

3513
02:11:27.401 --> 02:11:27.401
<v Speaker 6>and he raises them correctly and trains </v>
<v Speaker 6>have to be a good fighter.</v>

3514
02:11:27.401 --> 02:11:31.270
<v Speaker 6>They'll go out there with a healthy </v>
<v Speaker 6>respect for the art form and they'll go </v>

3515
02:11:31.270 --> 02:11:31.710
<v Speaker 6>out there and do it right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But if you get a guy and he just.</v>

3516
02:11:31.730 --> 02:11:34.970
<v Speaker 6>That's how he developed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He developed like this is a style,</v>

3517
02:11:35.120 --> 02:11:37.340
<v Speaker 6>and then he tried to coach him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

3518
02:11:37.490 --> 02:11:38.450
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>good luck.</v>

3519
02:11:38.590 --> 02:11:43.590
<v Speaker 6>The new tricks that will you mean.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So to see some fighters and all they </v>

3520
02:11:43.590 --> 02:11:46.421
<v Speaker 6>want to do is brawl and they brought </v>
<v Speaker 6>every fight and then you see other </v>

3521
02:11:46.421 --> 02:11:46.421
<v Speaker 6>fighters were.</v>

3522
02:11:46.421 --> 02:11:47.180
<v Speaker 6>They skillfully avoid strikes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Take the guy down,</v>

3523
02:11:47.181 --> 02:11:48.680
<v Speaker 6>strangle them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You never see.</v>

3524
02:11:48.800 --> 02:11:51.200
<v Speaker 6>Very rarely I should say.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wouldn't say never.</v>

3525
02:11:51.380 --> 02:11:53.750
<v Speaker 6>He never.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He very rarely see someone go from being</v>

3526
02:11:53.751 --> 02:11:56.840
<v Speaker 6>the meathead brawler to being the super </v>
<v Speaker 6>intelligent,</v>

3527
02:11:56.960 --> 02:11:59.980
<v Speaker 6>ultra skilled technician to get through </v>
<v Speaker 6>a fight and takes no damn.</v>

3528
02:12:00.140 --> 02:12:01.430
<v Speaker 6>Imagine you want to be surgical about </v>
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>

3529
02:12:01.431 --> 02:12:02.480
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You should.</v>

3530
02:12:02.481 --> 02:12:07.481
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well you should treat it like what it </v>

3531
02:12:07.481 --> 02:12:09.701
<v Speaker 6>is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a martial art and it's a game and </v>

3532
02:12:09.701 --> 02:12:09.730
<v Speaker 6>the game is due punishment without </v>
<v Speaker 6>getting punishment done to you.</v>

3533
02:12:09.770 --> 02:12:12.080
<v Speaker 6>Be superIor in every single aspect of </v>
<v Speaker 6>the game.</v>

3534
02:12:12.320 --> 02:12:14.780
<v Speaker 6>Be able to force your will on that </v>
<v Speaker 6>person.</v>

3535
02:12:14.900 --> 02:12:16.940
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the intelligent part about it.</v>

3536
02:12:17.150 --> 02:12:17.970
<v Speaker 6>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3537
02:12:18.070 --> 02:12:20.600
<v Speaker 6>it's also when you get fight of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>night bonuses and you know,</v>

3538
02:12:20.601 --> 02:12:23.600
<v Speaker 6>you want to make the crowd cheer and you</v>
<v Speaker 6>know and get that adrenaline.</v>

3539
02:12:23.630 --> 02:12:24.230
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3540
02:12:24.231 --> 02:12:25.170
<v Speaker 6>And a lot of guys,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3541
02:12:25.220 --> 02:12:27.920
<v Speaker 6>they love to say they finished fights,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they go out there and they put it on the</v>

3542
02:12:27.921 --> 02:12:29.780
<v Speaker 6>line and it does make for more exciting </v>
<v Speaker 6>fight.</v>

3543
02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:31.580
<v Speaker 6>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's absolutely true.</v>

3544
02:12:31.970 --> 02:12:35.780
<v Speaker 6>But I had this exact conversation with a</v>
<v Speaker 6>guy named john donner,</v>

3545
02:12:35.910 --> 02:12:38.870
<v Speaker 6>who's is a pretty infamous jujitsu </v>
<v Speaker 6>instructor,</v>

3546
02:12:38.990 --> 02:12:40.550
<v Speaker 6>really super,</v>
<v Speaker 6>super smart guy,</v>

3547
02:12:40.850 --> 02:12:44.360
<v Speaker 6>and he and I both agreed that the most </v>
<v Speaker 6>important thing is,</v>

3548
02:12:44.510 --> 02:12:46.730
<v Speaker 6>even though it's good to be exciting as </v>
<v Speaker 6>a fighter,</v>

3549
02:12:46.731 --> 02:12:47.870
<v Speaker 6>it's good to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3550
02:12:48.140 --> 02:12:53.140
<v Speaker 6>it's good to please the crowd and it </v>
<v Speaker 6>makes the sport more popular and </v>

3551
02:12:53.140 --> 02:12:53.450
<v Speaker 6>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I absolutely agree with that too,</v>

3552
02:12:53.451 --> 02:12:58.451
<v Speaker 6>but the most important thing is to be </v>
<v Speaker 6>very skilled and to be the most skilled </v>

3553
02:12:58.701 --> 02:13:03.701
<v Speaker 6>and do the exact right thing that you're</v>
<v Speaker 6>supposed to be doing in order to apply </v>

3554
02:13:03.701 --> 02:13:04.730
<v Speaker 6>damage,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but take little return.</v>

3555
02:13:04.850 --> 02:13:09.260
<v Speaker 6>And when you take unnecessary risks and </v>
<v Speaker 6>you do something in an unsmart manner,</v>

3556
02:13:09.470 --> 02:13:11.030
<v Speaker 6>you're degrading your art.</v>

3557
02:13:11.230 --> 02:13:11.800
<v Speaker 6>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're,</v>

3558
02:13:11.801 --> 02:13:14.060
<v Speaker 6>you're watering down your purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're,</v>

3559
02:13:14.061 --> 02:13:19.061
<v Speaker 6>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're doing something that's not the </v>

3560
02:13:19.061 --> 02:13:19.061
<v Speaker 6>optimal way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not the artistic way to do it.</v>

3561
02:13:19.061 --> 02:13:20.930
<v Speaker 6>You're not,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're not fighting it correctly.</v>

3562
02:13:20.990 --> 02:13:22.280
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's like riding a wave,</v>

3563
02:13:22.310 --> 02:13:23.390
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when you get off that way,</v>

3564
02:13:23.391 --> 02:13:25.160
<v Speaker 6>what do you want to do?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You want to face plant into the rocks.</v>

3565
02:13:25.161 --> 02:13:26.270
<v Speaker 6>Of course not.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

3566
02:13:26.271 --> 02:13:31.271
<v Speaker 6>you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you want to ride that bitch and be </v>

3567
02:13:31.271 --> 02:13:31.271
<v Speaker 6>perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the way that I can't.</v>

3568
02:13:31.271 --> 02:13:31.271
<v Speaker 6>I can't speak on them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And it's just,</v>

3569
02:13:31.271 --> 02:13:32.220
<v Speaker 6>it's a world that said so</v>

3570
02:13:32.300 --> 02:13:33.080
<v Speaker 4>alien.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3571
02:13:33.090 --> 02:13:35.430
<v Speaker 4>I would say it's alien to me and I've </v>
<v Speaker 4>done martial arts my whole life,</v>

3572
02:13:35.431 --> 02:13:37.380
<v Speaker 4>but I've never fought in the ufc,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3573
02:13:37.381 --> 02:13:40.140
<v Speaker 4>and being around over at least a </v>
<v Speaker 4>thousand fights,</v>

3574
02:13:40.141 --> 02:13:40.890
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3575
02:13:41.100 --> 02:13:44.730
<v Speaker 4>But we were talking about like guys like</v>
<v Speaker 4>being used to trauma.</v>

3576
02:13:44.731 --> 02:13:47.850
<v Speaker 4>I'm way too used to trauma.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So normal for me.</v>

3577
02:13:47.860 --> 02:13:50.240
<v Speaker 4>I've been at bars with dudes are beating</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fuck out of each other.</v>

3578
02:13:50.260 --> 02:13:50.780
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3579
02:13:50.850 --> 02:13:53.160
<v Speaker 4>these guys hit each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Keep your hands up,</v>

3580
02:13:53.230 --> 02:13:54.900
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A fucking pussy.</v>

3581
02:13:54.990 --> 02:13:55.860
<v Speaker 4>That's the irony,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3582
02:13:55.861 --> 02:13:56.320
<v Speaker 4>Is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3583
02:13:56.340 --> 02:14:01.340
<v Speaker 4>when we do these games these days for </v>
<v Speaker 4>your pet as guys and they just need a </v>

3584
02:14:01.340 --> 02:14:04.491
<v Speaker 4>terrine arms off beat people to death of</v>
<v Speaker 4>it and like you see anything in real </v>

3585
02:14:04.491 --> 02:14:04.491
<v Speaker 4>life and it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>jesus,</v>

3586
02:14:04.491 --> 02:14:05.670
<v Speaker 4>I get seven getting sick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3587
02:14:05.870 --> 02:14:07.400
<v Speaker 4>Well that's a good question man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like,</v>

3588
02:14:07.590 --> 02:14:09.510
<v Speaker 4>what do you think about this whole </v>
<v Speaker 4>debate that,</v>

3589
02:14:09.540 --> 02:14:10.120
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

3590
02:14:10.121 --> 02:14:15.121
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's pretty silly and kind of </v>

3591
02:14:15.121 --> 02:14:16.260
<v Speaker 4>like not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not well thought out,</v>

3592
02:14:16.470 --> 02:14:18.750
<v Speaker 4>this idea that violent games make people</v>
<v Speaker 4>violent.</v>

3593
02:14:19.020 --> 02:14:23.220
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think whatever happened to crazy first</v>

3594
02:14:23.221 --> 02:14:24.120
<v Speaker 4>and foremost,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3595
02:14:24.150 --> 02:14:25.650
<v Speaker 4>It's a chris rock's kind of think about </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

3596
02:14:25.990 --> 02:14:28.470
<v Speaker 4>I honestly think it's a situation that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

3597
02:14:28.490 --> 02:14:30.270
<v Speaker 4>they relieve more stress than they </v>
<v Speaker 4>cause.</v>

3598
02:14:30.900 --> 02:14:35.900
<v Speaker 4>LIke it's a cathartic thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if there's a certain type of mind </v>

3599
02:14:35.900 --> 02:14:39.941
<v Speaker 4>that's drawn to a certain type of </v>
<v Speaker 4>entertainment that was just predisposed </v>

3600
02:14:39.941 --> 02:14:39.941
<v Speaker 4>to that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3601
02:14:39.941 --> 02:14:39.941
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that person's sick period.</v>

3602
02:14:39.941 --> 02:14:44.930
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you're not going to get violent </v>

3603
02:14:44.930 --> 02:14:44.930
<v Speaker 4>games.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was hitler playing?</v>

3604
02:14:44.930 --> 02:14:44.930
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that kind of thing.</v>

3605
02:14:44.930 --> 02:14:45.390
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's just like,</v>

3606
02:14:45.391 --> 02:14:46.620
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3607
02:14:47.280 --> 02:14:52.280
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We cannot create a society based upon </v>

3608
02:14:52.280 --> 02:14:52.280
<v Speaker 4>the lowest common denominator of </v>
<v Speaker 4>entertainment.</v>

3609
02:14:52.280 --> 02:14:54.140
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Write like a or anything or anything.</v>

3610
02:14:54.260 --> 02:14:55.860
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's entertainment for kids,</v>

3611
02:14:55.861 --> 02:14:58.980
<v Speaker 4>it's entertainment for adults and that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way the world works.</v>

3612
02:14:58.981 --> 02:15:00.450
<v Speaker 4>I mean it should be that way with </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>

3613
02:15:00.451 --> 02:15:01.950
<v Speaker 4>Access to information,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3614
02:15:01.951 --> 02:15:06.951
<v Speaker 4>propaganda you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't like program society for the </v>

3615
02:15:06.951 --> 02:15:07.020
<v Speaker 4>lowest common denominator.</v>

3616
02:15:07.370 --> 02:15:08.160
<v Speaker 4>What you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're,</v>

3617
02:15:08.161 --> 02:15:10.350
<v Speaker 4>if you're not allowing intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

3618
02:15:10.351 --> 02:15:15.351
<v Speaker 4>we're not going to be effective if </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're trying to restrict their access </v>

3619
02:15:15.351 --> 02:15:17.961
<v Speaker 4>to things like video games and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>personally think the market will bear </v>

3620
02:15:17.961 --> 02:15:17.961
<v Speaker 4>what the market will bear,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3621
02:15:17.961 --> 02:15:22.650
<v Speaker 4>Like you look at what we do with a </v>
<v Speaker 4>styliZed violence of these big giant </v>

3622
02:15:22.650 --> 02:15:23.070
<v Speaker 4>guys and space armor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ripping the arms of lizard men.</v>

3623
02:15:23.490 --> 02:15:28.490
<v Speaker 4>If there's a game about a guy on </v>
<v Speaker 4>flatbush avenue with the yankees hat </v>

3624
02:15:28.490 --> 02:15:30.900
<v Speaker 4>pulling off the arm of somebody else </v>
<v Speaker 4>with the red sox hat and it was depicted</v>

3625
02:15:30.901 --> 02:15:31.860
<v Speaker 4>real lake,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it be kind of like,</v>

3626
02:15:31.890 --> 02:15:36.890
<v Speaker 4>eh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then the violence in grand theft </v>

3627
02:15:36.890 --> 02:15:39.051
<v Speaker 4>auto on the other hand plays very well </v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's done within the context of </v>

3628
02:15:39.051 --> 02:15:42.171
<v Speaker 4>the story or it's done comedically where</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're running over a hooker or </v>

3629
02:15:42.171 --> 02:15:42.171
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3630
02:15:42.171 --> 02:15:44.530
<v Speaker 4>It's all people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If people are willing to say that,</v>

3631
02:15:44.840 --> 02:15:45.480
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

3632
02:15:45.720 --> 02:15:47.670
<v Speaker 4>but what if the government steps in?</v>

3633
02:15:47.670 --> 02:15:52.670
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's been many times where there's </v>

3634
02:15:52.670 --> 02:15:54.321
<v Speaker 4>been talk about legislating what the </v>
<v Speaker 4>content of video games and making sure </v>

3635
02:15:54.321 --> 02:15:56.430
<v Speaker 4>that there's rules what you can and </v>
<v Speaker 4>can't do.</v>

3636
02:15:56.460 --> 02:15:57.990
<v Speaker 4>They're already rose though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the thIng.</v>

3637
02:15:57.991 --> 02:16:00.520
<v Speaker 4>that's what people forget is the fact </v>
<v Speaker 4>that this rating,</v>

3638
02:16:00.530 --> 02:16:05.530
<v Speaker 4>so if there's a rating system,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a parental restrictions on the </v>

3639
02:16:05.530 --> 02:16:08.031
<v Speaker 4>consoles which are very easy to set and </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's also the fact that the games </v>

3640
02:16:08.031 --> 02:16:09.270
<v Speaker 4>costs a certain amount of money in order</v>
<v Speaker 4>to get access to.</v>

3641
02:16:09.450 --> 02:16:12.950
<v Speaker 4>There's multiple gateways there that are</v>
<v Speaker 4>in place and on top of all of that there</v>

3642
02:16:12.951 --> 02:16:15.630
<v Speaker 4>is of course the parenting issue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but is there the situation like there is</v>

3643
02:16:15.631 --> 02:16:17.100
<v Speaker 4>with movies where they tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
