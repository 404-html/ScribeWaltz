00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:02.890
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:05.770
<v Speaker 1>Everyone knows that the two party system is kind of stupid,</v>

3
00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:10.630
<v Speaker 1>but everyone seems to think that any other party other than the two party system</v>

4
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.700
<v Speaker 1>is unrealistic or any other party,</v>

5
00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.940
<v Speaker 1>like a Libertarian Green party somewhere along anything independent is</v>

6
00:00:15.941 --> 00:00:16.774
<v Speaker 1>unrealistic.</v>

7
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.530
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

8
00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:17.881
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

9
00:00:17.881 --> 00:00:22.881
<v Speaker 1>I'm back to right now 50% of all people that are registering to vote or are</v>

10
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.130
<v Speaker 1>registering is independent.</v>

11
00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:26.151
<v Speaker 1>Statistically,</v>

12
00:00:26.151 --> 00:00:26.541
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>

13
00:00:26.541 --> 00:00:29.540
<v Speaker 1>43% of America is independent,</v>

14
00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.580
<v Speaker 1>but new registrations,</v>

15
00:00:31.581 --> 00:00:32.480
<v Speaker 1>50%.</v>

16
00:00:32.481 --> 00:00:33.530
<v Speaker 1>So I don't,</v>

17
00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:34.101
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

18
00:00:34.101 --> 00:00:34.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't know as the,</v>

19
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.640
<v Speaker 1>as people do identify with the two parties,</v>

20
00:00:37.641 --> 00:00:39.670
<v Speaker 1>the rigged game of the system is,</v>

21
00:00:39.671 --> 00:00:41.960
<v Speaker 1>is that we're only presented with two choices.</v>

22
00:00:41.961 --> 00:00:44.990
<v Speaker 1>And that really starts with just being in the polls.</v>

23
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.430
<v Speaker 1>Look right now,</v>

24
00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:47.720
<v Speaker 1>if Mickey Mouse,</v>

25
00:00:47.721 --> 00:00:49.790
<v Speaker 1>where the third name in any poll,</v>

26
00:00:49.791 --> 00:00:54.791
<v Speaker 1>Mickey would be pulling it 30% but Mickey's not on the ballot in all 50 states.</v>

27
00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.810
<v Speaker 1>And if I'm the libertarian nominee and I hope to be the libertarian nominee that</v>

28
00:00:59.811 --> 00:01:01.610
<v Speaker 1>happens next weekend,</v>

29
00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.580
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

30
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be the only other candidate on the ballot in all 50 states.</v>

31
00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.810
<v Speaker 1>So polling,</v>

32
00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:09.440
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

33
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.480
<v Speaker 1>I just want to be in the polls.</v>

34
00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.780
<v Speaker 1>There is no way a third party wins without being in the presidential debates.</v>

35
00:01:16.881 --> 00:01:18.700
<v Speaker 1>That's just not going to happen.</v>

36
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.160
<v Speaker 1>A Superbowl of politics to get in the presidential debates,</v>

37
00:01:22.161 --> 00:01:24.590
<v Speaker 1>you have to be at 15% in the polls,</v>

38
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.921
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>

39
00:01:24.921 --> 00:01:26.240
<v Speaker 1>The rig game is,</v>

40
00:01:26.241 --> 00:01:28.640
<v Speaker 1>is that if you're not in the polls,</v>

41
00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.700
<v Speaker 1>there's no way that you can pull at 15%,</v>

42
00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.590
<v Speaker 1>but it has to be a consistent polling.</v>

43
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.033
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

44
00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.750
<v Speaker 1>starting now,</v>

45
00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.520
<v Speaker 1>I was in the first national poll that I've been in a month ago.</v>

46
00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.620
<v Speaker 1>I haven't been in a national poll since,</v>

47
00:01:44.621 --> 00:01:45.430
<v Speaker 1>but in a month,</v>

48
00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:46.211
<v Speaker 1>a month ago,</v>

49
00:01:46.211 --> 00:01:49.300
<v Speaker 1>I was at 11% against Hillary and Trump.</v>

50
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.670
<v Speaker 1>And was this all established back when Ross Perot sort of shook up the political</v>

51
00:01:54.671 --> 00:01:59.110
<v Speaker 1>establishment because that there was a lower percentage required to get involved</v>

52
00:01:59.111 --> 00:02:01.330
<v Speaker 1>in debates before that actually sent?</v>

53
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.871
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

54
00:02:01.871 --> 00:02:05.800
<v Speaker 1>actually there was no percentage points prior to Ross Perot.</v>

55
00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.410
<v Speaker 1>That was something that got established after Ross Perot.</v>

56
00:02:08.411 --> 00:02:09.220
<v Speaker 1>And what,</v>

57
00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.220
<v Speaker 1>what is amazing to me is Ross Perot after having gotten 19% of the general</v>

58
00:02:15.581 --> 00:02:17.620
<v Speaker 1>election vote the first time.</v>

59
00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.600
<v Speaker 1>The second time he ran,</v>

60
00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.630
<v Speaker 1>they did not allow him in the presidential debates,</v>

61
00:02:22.631 --> 00:02:23.464
<v Speaker 1>which is just,</v>

62
00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:24.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

63
00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.080
<v Speaker 1>that's the rigged nature of the game.</v>

64
00:02:26.081 --> 00:02:27.640
<v Speaker 1>The rig nature of the game is,</v>

65
00:02:27.641 --> 00:02:28.780
<v Speaker 1>is come this fall.</v>

66
00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.140
<v Speaker 1>If my name does not appear in another single pole,</v>

67
00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.120
<v Speaker 1>the presidential debate commission,</v>

68
00:02:34.121 --> 00:02:35.920
<v Speaker 1>we'll say a Gary Johnson.</v>

69
00:02:35.921 --> 00:02:37.690
<v Speaker 1>He just didn't pull high enough.</v>

70
00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.641
<v Speaker 1>What they've,</v>

71
00:02:38.641 --> 00:02:42.400
<v Speaker 1>what they won't say is that he wasn't in the polls and the commission for</v>

72
00:02:42.401 --> 00:02:45.130
<v Speaker 1>presidential debates is a privately funded institution.</v>

73
00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.060
<v Speaker 1>Private Democrats and Republicans were suing the presidential debate commission.</v>

74
00:02:49.061 --> 00:02:49.631
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

75
00:02:49.631 --> 00:02:52.030
<v Speaker 1>we think that it's a antitrust,</v>

76
00:02:52.031 --> 00:02:52.751
<v Speaker 1>we think that,</v>

77
00:02:52.751 --> 00:02:53.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

78
00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.510
<v Speaker 1>not think it's Democrats and Republicans and they collude with one another to</v>

79
00:02:58.511 --> 00:03:00.040
<v Speaker 1>exclude else.</v>

80
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.640
<v Speaker 1>Bruce Fein is suing the presidential debate commission.</v>

81
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.660
<v Speaker 1>Bruce finds claim to fame is that he brought Nixon down in Watergate,</v>

82
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.250
<v Speaker 1>but in the next sentence,</v>

83
00:03:09.251 --> 00:03:12.520
<v Speaker 1>he will tell you that the biggest thing he's ever done in his life is suing the</v>

84
00:03:12.521 --> 00:03:16.180
<v Speaker 1>presidential debate commission because this has the opportunity of changing</v>

85
00:03:16.181 --> 00:03:17.320
<v Speaker 1>politics in America.</v>

86
00:03:17.321 --> 00:03:17.531
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

87
00:03:17.531 --> 00:03:19.930
<v Speaker 1>this is really at the heart of this rig game.</v>

88
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.600
<v Speaker 1>You can't win the presidency if you're not in the super bowl of politics.</v>

89
00:03:25.601 --> 00:03:25.901
<v Speaker 1>We've,</v>

90
00:03:25.901 --> 00:03:29.800
<v Speaker 1>we figured the dollar value alone of being in the presidential debates is</v>

91
00:03:29.801 --> 00:03:31.720
<v Speaker 1>several hundred million dollars.</v>

92
00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.220
<v Speaker 1>Just think of the Super Bowl and the ads that sell during the super bowl.</v>

93
00:03:36.221 --> 00:03:38.250
<v Speaker 1>And imagine being a,</v>

94
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.200
<v Speaker 1>having second biggest audience.</v>

95
00:03:41.201 --> 00:03:44.080
<v Speaker 1>You don't have like 75 million people for,</v>

96
00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

97
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:45.221
<v Speaker 1>90 minutes,</v>

98
00:03:45.221 --> 00:03:46.054
<v Speaker 1>two hours.</v>

99
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.500
<v Speaker 1>That's a couple of hundred million dollars worth of advertising.</v>

100
00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:50.401
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

101
00:03:50.401 --> 00:03:51.660
<v Speaker 2>That is the show.</v>

102
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.040
<v Speaker 2>And if you're not in the show,</v>

103
00:03:53.041 --> 00:03:54.510
<v Speaker 2>people don't consider your vote.</v>

104
00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:55.920
<v Speaker 2>Like they think of,</v>

105
00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.800
<v Speaker 2>even if you have 50% of these people that are registering and saying they're</v>

106
00:03:58.801 --> 00:03:59.580
<v Speaker 2>independent,</v>

107
00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.920
<v Speaker 2>what they're really saying is they're not committing to a left or a right.</v>

108
00:04:01.921 --> 00:04:04.020
<v Speaker 2>They're not committing to a democratic or Republican,</v>

109
00:04:04.021 --> 00:04:06.060
<v Speaker 2>but are they gonna vote independent?</v>

110
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:07.560
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot of people.</v>

111
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.230
<v Speaker 2>They have this idea that if you vote independent,</v>

112
00:04:10.231 --> 00:04:11.640
<v Speaker 2>you're throwing away your vote.</v>

113
00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:12.180
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

114
00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.980
<v Speaker 2>that is a stigma that has to be overcome.</v>

115
00:04:13.981 --> 00:04:14.340
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

116
00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.531
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

117
00:04:14.531 --> 00:04:14.600
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

118
00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.800
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

119
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.981
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

120
00:04:14.981 --> 00:04:15.990
<v Speaker 1>I agree,</v>

121
00:04:15.991 --> 00:04:16.800
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

122
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:21.330
<v Speaker 1>but for those people that they do vote right and they end up voting on the basis</v>

123
00:04:21.331 --> 00:04:22.830
<v Speaker 1>of the lesser of two evils.</v>

124
00:04:22.831 --> 00:04:26.790
<v Speaker 1>But since they're registering to vote and they're registering to vote as</v>

125
00:04:26.791 --> 00:04:27.690
<v Speaker 1>independent,</v>

126
00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.520
<v Speaker 1>they end up at the polls.</v>

127
00:04:29.521 --> 00:04:29.851
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

128
00:04:29.851 --> 00:04:30.684
<v Speaker 1>for the most part,</v>

129
00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:31.230
<v Speaker 1>most,</v>

130
00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:32.670
<v Speaker 1>most people don't even go to the poll.</v>

131
00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:33.930
<v Speaker 1>Most people don't even vote.</v>

132
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:35.041
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

133
00:04:35.041 --> 00:04:35.191
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

134
00:04:35.191 --> 00:04:36.024
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

135
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.240
<v Speaker 2>is there a way to fix it?</v>

136
00:04:37.241 --> 00:04:40.570
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that there's a way to maybe somehow or another allow people to vote</v>

137
00:04:40.571 --> 00:04:42.880
<v Speaker 2>online and change the way it's set up?</v>

138
00:04:42.881 --> 00:04:43.151
<v Speaker 2>Now?</v>

139
00:04:43.151 --> 00:04:45.100
<v Speaker 2>We don't have to physically go to a location.</v>

140
00:04:45.101 --> 00:04:49.110
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to sign up physically in a place.</v>

141
00:04:49.111 --> 00:04:52.600
<v Speaker 2>So you can actually just do it from your computer the same way we bank.</v>

142
00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.630
<v Speaker 1>That has to be the future.</v>

143
00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:56.110
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

144
00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.910
<v Speaker 1>that does not exist now,</v>

145
00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.590
<v Speaker 1>but that has to be the future.</v>

146
00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.200
<v Speaker 1>And from a legislative standpoint,</v>

147
00:05:02.201 --> 00:05:02.740
<v Speaker 1>meaning,</v>

148
00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:03.101
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

149
00:05:03.101 --> 00:05:06.760
<v Speaker 1>you're president of the United States or governor of New Mexico,</v>

150
00:05:06.761 --> 00:05:08.650
<v Speaker 1>you could sign legislation that,</v>

151
00:05:08.651 --> 00:05:09.300
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

152
00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.460
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

153
00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.590
<v Speaker 1>and these are the things that are going to happen.</v>

154
00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.540
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be easier and easier to vote.</v>

155
00:05:13.541 --> 00:05:15.490
<v Speaker 1>And that's what should be the case.</v>

156
00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.890
<v Speaker 2>Be the case if the system isn't totally Rick.</v>

157
00:05:17.891 --> 00:05:20.710
<v Speaker 2>Cause the problem is people like Hillary,</v>

158
00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:22.010
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

159
00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:24.100
<v Speaker 2>the people that are longtime establish them,</v>

160
00:05:24.101 --> 00:05:25.660
<v Speaker 2>people that have been a part of politics forever,</v>

161
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.170
<v Speaker 2>the last thing they want to do is turn over the reins to the Internet because</v>

162
00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:30.900
<v Speaker 2>she's had what did what,</v>

163
00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:31.660
<v Speaker 2>how much they send.</v>

164
00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.530
<v Speaker 2>They say they're spending spending over a million dollars just to combat online</v>

165
00:05:35.531 --> 00:05:39.520
<v Speaker 2>trolls just to go on reddit and forums and correct people.</v>

166
00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:40.150
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

167
00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.630
<v Speaker 1>And I would,</v>

168
00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.910
<v Speaker 1>I would be surprised if the number was that low.</v>

169
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:43.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

170
00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:44.380
<v Speaker 2>I would be surprised too.</v>

171
00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:44.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

172
00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:45.371
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

173
00:05:45.371 --> 00:05:45.570
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

174
00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:47.440
<v Speaker 2>they're probably being pretty conservative about that.</v>

175
00:05:47.441 --> 00:05:52.441
<v Speaker 2>But the idea is that the internet doesn't like the establishment.</v>

176
00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:54.670
<v Speaker 2>They know that there's a real problem with the system,</v>

177
00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.440
<v Speaker 2>the system in place as is.</v>

178
00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:57.261
<v Speaker 2>And the Internet,</v>

179
00:05:57.261 --> 00:05:58.350
<v Speaker 2>when I say the Internet and of the,</v>

180
00:05:58.351 --> 00:06:03.170
<v Speaker 2>the broad stroke that you're painting is obviously young people who are a little</v>

181
00:06:03.171 --> 00:06:08.171
<v Speaker 2>bit more aware of how screwy this whole system that they're sort of born into</v>

182
00:06:08.181 --> 00:06:08.810
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

183
00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.390
<v Speaker 2>And that the people that are in charge don't want change.</v>

184
00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:12.950
<v Speaker 2>They want to keep it at two party system.</v>

185
00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:14.960
<v Speaker 2>They want to keep this silly white hat,</v>

186
00:06:14.961 --> 00:06:15.620
<v Speaker 2>black hat,</v>

187
00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:19.760
<v Speaker 2>goofy game going on forever and keep control of the power</v>

188
00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:21.590
<v Speaker 1>right on.</v>

189
00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:22.490
<v Speaker 1>And this,</v>

190
00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.790
<v Speaker 1>but this cycle for the first time in my lifetime,</v>

191
00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:27.830
<v Speaker 1>this might change.</v>

192
00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean this because of just how polarizing the two of them are.</v>

193
00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:31.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

194
00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:36.310
<v Speaker 2>and I think Bernie Sanders is what a lot of people think of as the alternative</v>

195
00:06:36.311 --> 00:06:36.701
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

196
00:06:36.701 --> 00:06:37.930
<v Speaker 2>Mainstream alternative.</v>

197
00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.660
<v Speaker 2>He stands pretty far out there from the other guys.</v>

198
00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:43.980
<v Speaker 1>So have you seen the website I side with.com no,</v>

199
00:06:43.981 --> 00:06:44.290
<v Speaker 1>I haven't.</v>

200
00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:45.090
<v Speaker 1>You gotta write it down.</v>

201
00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:45.810
<v Speaker 1>You've got to take,</v>

202
00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:49.960
<v Speaker 1>take this political quiz I side and everybody listening take this political quiz</v>

203
00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:53.530
<v Speaker 1>I side with.com it's about 60 questions.</v>

204
00:06:53.531 --> 00:06:54.820
<v Speaker 1>It's really easy.</v>

205
00:06:54.821 --> 00:06:55.570
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to,</v>

206
00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:56.051
<v Speaker 1>you know know you.</v>

207
00:06:56.051 --> 00:06:58.060
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to sign up on the website,</v>

208
00:06:58.061 --> 00:07:01.270
<v Speaker 1>but you take this quiz and at the end of the quiz you get paired up with a</v>

209
00:07:01.271 --> 00:07:04.090
<v Speaker 1>presidential candidate most in line with your views.</v>

210
00:07:04.091 --> 00:07:05.530
<v Speaker 1>It just makes real sense.</v>

211
00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:09.910
<v Speaker 1>I think everybody should take the quiz and whoever you line up with,</v>

212
00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:10.330
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

213
00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:13.030
<v Speaker 1>I think you should knock yourself out supporting that person.</v>

214
00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:13.811
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

215
00:07:13.811 --> 00:07:14.351
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>

216
00:07:14.351 --> 00:07:16.300
<v Speaker 1>taking the I side with quiz,</v>

217
00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:17.230
<v Speaker 1>amazingly,</v>

218
00:07:17.231 --> 00:07:20.980
<v Speaker 1>the next politician that I aligned with outside of the libertarians that are</v>

219
00:07:20.981 --> 00:07:23.290
<v Speaker 1>running for president is Bernie Sanders.</v>

220
00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:24.220
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

221
00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:27.280
<v Speaker 1>I aligned with Bernie Sanders 73% of what he says.</v>

222
00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:27.431
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

223
00:07:27.431 --> 00:07:28.690
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to economics,</v>

224
00:07:28.691 --> 00:07:30.310
<v Speaker 1>we come to a t in the road,</v>

225
00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:31.131
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

226
00:07:31.131 --> 00:07:33.370
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to the socialism versus,</v>

227
00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:33.850
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

228
00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:34.241
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

229
00:07:34.241 --> 00:07:39.100
<v Speaker 1>being an entrepreneur when it comes to big government versus small government,</v>

230
00:07:39.101 --> 00:07:40.660
<v Speaker 1>we come to that t in the road.</v>

231
00:07:40.661 --> 00:07:40.991
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

232
00:07:40.991 --> 00:07:41.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

233
00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:44.320
<v Speaker 1>on the issues of legalizing marijuana,</v>

234
00:07:44.321 --> 00:07:45.670
<v Speaker 1>same sex marriage,</v>

235
00:07:45.671 --> 00:07:47.050
<v Speaker 1>a woman's right to choose,</v>

236
00:07:47.051 --> 00:07:47.884
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

237
00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:50.830
<v Speaker 1>let's stop with these military interventions.</v>

238
00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:51.700
<v Speaker 1>This is just,</v>

239
00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:52.870
<v Speaker 1>this is just crazy.</v>

240
00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:54.160
<v Speaker 1>We're in line.</v>

241
00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:55.533
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

242
00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:56.360
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

243
00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:56.890
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

244
00:07:56.890 --> 00:07:59.080
<v Speaker 1>I pushed this website because,</v>

245
00:07:59.081 --> 00:07:59.560
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

246
00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:01.300
<v Speaker 1>it should work the other way around.</v>

247
00:08:01.301 --> 00:08:01.661
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

248
00:08:01.661 --> 00:08:03.580
<v Speaker 1>I side with Bernie most of the time,</v>

249
00:08:03.581 --> 00:08:05.200
<v Speaker 1>but oh my gosh,</v>

250
00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:07.180
<v Speaker 1>the libertarian candidate,</v>

251
00:08:07.181 --> 00:08:07.961
<v Speaker 1>Gary Johnson,</v>

252
00:08:07.961 --> 00:08:09.610
<v Speaker 1>I side with next in line.</v>

253
00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.620
<v Speaker 1>And I do believe that,</v>

254
00:08:11.621 --> 00:08:12.310
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

255
00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:14.320
<v Speaker 1>Bernie is not going to get the nomination.</v>

256
00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's going to happen.</v>

257
00:08:16.061 --> 00:08:17.770
<v Speaker 1>And where do all those voters go?</v>

258
00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:23.490
<v Speaker 1>Where does 50% of Republicans go that really are at the end of the day and was</v>

259
00:08:24.671 --> 00:08:27.730
<v Speaker 1>socially tolerant and fiscally conservative.</v>

260
00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:30.970
<v Speaker 1>And I think that is the majority of Republican voters,</v>

261
00:08:30.971 --> 00:08:31.450
<v Speaker 1>but a,</v>

262
00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:36.450
<v Speaker 1>they'd been co opted by the social conservatives that have an agenda that I</v>

263
00:08:37.001 --> 00:08:40.030
<v Speaker 1>think is really a turnoff to most of America.</v>

264
00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.160
<v Speaker 1>And it's okay to be a social conservative.</v>

265
00:08:42.161 --> 00:08:44.110
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing wrong with being a social conservative,</v>

266
00:08:44.111 --> 00:08:44.944
<v Speaker 1>but if you,</v>

267
00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.080
<v Speaker 1>if you equate,</v>

268
00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:48.640
<v Speaker 1>if you make that public policy,</v>

269
00:08:48.641 --> 00:08:51.880
<v Speaker 1>if you pass laws regarding social conservatism,</v>

270
00:08:51.881 --> 00:08:54.820
<v Speaker 1>you end up putting people in jail for personal choices.</v>

271
00:08:54.821 --> 00:08:59.460
<v Speaker 1>And we do have the highest incarceration rate of any country in the world.</v>

272
00:08:59.461 --> 00:09:01.290
<v Speaker 1>And I think that starts with the drug war.</v>

273
00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:03.210
<v Speaker 1>The word conservative is interesting too,</v>

274
00:09:03.211 --> 00:09:06.360
<v Speaker 1>when you apply it to social issues like social conservativism cause</v>

275
00:09:06.361 --> 00:09:10.470
<v Speaker 1>conservatives really want the original conservatives were stay out of my</v>

276
00:09:10.471 --> 00:09:10.891
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>

277
00:09:10.891 --> 00:09:11.910
<v Speaker 1>I'll stay out of yours.</v>

278
00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:17.090
<v Speaker 1>So social conservative really wouldn't apply to like things along the lines of</v>

279
00:09:17.341 --> 00:09:20.720
<v Speaker 1>gay marriage or same sex unions or anything along those.</v>

280
00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:21.061
<v Speaker 1>You would,</v>

281
00:09:21.061 --> 00:09:21.451
<v Speaker 1>you'd say,</v>

282
00:09:21.451 --> 00:09:22.710
<v Speaker 1>we'll leave those people alone.</v>

283
00:09:22.711 --> 00:09:24.390
<v Speaker 1>That would be the conservative approach.</v>

284
00:09:24.391 --> 00:09:26.850
<v Speaker 1>The government should stay out of those people's lives.</v>

285
00:09:26.851 --> 00:09:27.240
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

286
00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.073
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

287
00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:30.540
<v Speaker 1>it started out as classical liberal,</v>

288
00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:35.010
<v Speaker 1>classical liberal is being fiscally conservative and socially liberal,</v>

289
00:09:35.011 --> 00:09:36.750
<v Speaker 1>which got co-opted.</v>

290
00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:37.201
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

291
00:09:37.201 --> 00:09:37.490
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

292
00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:41.270
<v Speaker 1>that used to be what a conservative was co opted.</v>

293
00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:41.671
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

294
00:09:41.671 --> 00:09:42.504
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

295
00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:43.391
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

296
00:09:43.391 --> 00:09:44.940
<v Speaker 1>I think we're a little bit of both.</v>

297
00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:45.110
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

298
00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:48.630
<v Speaker 1>you've heard the old adage that if in college you weren't a Democrat,</v>

299
00:09:48.631 --> 00:09:49.770
<v Speaker 1>you didn't have a heart,</v>

300
00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:51.450
<v Speaker 1>and if a,</v>

301
00:09:51.451 --> 00:09:52.440
<v Speaker 1>as an adult,</v>

302
00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:53.550
<v Speaker 1>you weren't a Republican,</v>

303
00:09:53.551 --> 00:09:54.660
<v Speaker 1>you didn't have a brain.</v>

304
00:09:54.661 --> 00:09:55.494
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

305
00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:57.060
<v Speaker 1>I think we've got both.</v>

306
00:09:57.090 --> 00:09:59.100
<v Speaker 1>All of us have gotten both of those things.</v>

307
00:09:59.220 --> 00:09:59.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

308
00:09:59.610 --> 00:09:59.900
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

309
00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:02.640
<v Speaker 1>it's just real polarizing to have only two choices.</v>

310
00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:02.821
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

311
00:10:02.821 --> 00:10:03.280
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

312
00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:05.070
<v Speaker 1>and it's so polarizing because the,</v>

313
00:10:05.071 --> 00:10:06.120
<v Speaker 1>those issues,</v>

314
00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:06.810
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

315
00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:07.171
<v Speaker 1>at the,</v>

316
00:10:07.171 --> 00:10:08.550
<v Speaker 1>at the end of the day,</v>

317
00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:09.443
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

318
00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:14.520
<v Speaker 1>why can't Democrats and Republicans come together on some very common sense</v>

319
00:10:14.521 --> 00:10:16.950
<v Speaker 1>issues that would move the country forward.</v>

320
00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:27.110
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
