Brogan,

7
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.480
The only one that I've ever heard of that's even remotely effective.

8
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.370
I stand behind it and Nick Thune,
it's a solid product side.
Stand in it.

9
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.070
I'll give you one if you want one.
Do you want one?
Okay.

Ask Solent nick doing and our guests now has a free flashlights because there's

11
00:00:37.981 --> 00:00:42.870
this advertisement.
Is it just a,
just one of those regular flashlights?

12
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:43.261
Well,

13
00:00:43.261 --> 00:00:46.650
it looks like a flashlight and then you open the top and there's a rubber vagina

14
00:00:46.651 --> 00:00:51.200
and he goes,
Oh,
you've never seen one?
I've heard of him.
I've seen,

15
00:00:51.201 --> 00:00:55.890
I can't believe you got this phone up.
You're failing in one as it could've been,

16
00:00:55.891 --> 00:00:58.230
you know,
and the other ones do.
You have a butthole one over here

17
00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.270
and they didn't do it for real.
Did they look different?
Yeah,
the butthole one.

18
00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.100
It looks like a button.
It looks like a little usually looks pretty similar to,

19
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.800
it's really kind of disturbing.

20
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.890
It's just that I dunno man.

21
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.010
In two guys deciding about only wanting the bud hall,
you know,

22
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.500
like if you had to choose,
you don't want the vagina.

23
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.110
It's just people for your masturbation device.

24
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.930
I mean did the fact that you needed to look like a vagina at all?

25
00:01:24.931 --> 00:01:26.970
You just need it to feel good.
I mean,

26
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.500
what do you just compartmentalizing your visual cortex so you only see the part

27
00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.320
that's attached your Dick's.
It looks like a rubber pussy.

28
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.090
You don't use your brain and go,
why would it rubber pussy being a pleasant to,

29
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.170
what am I doing?
What am I come on,
man.
You know what they should do?

30
00:01:42.171 --> 00:01:45.150
They should do.
I try fucked up flashlight where it's like,
it's like,

31
00:01:45.151 --> 00:01:46.830
it looks like a,
you know,

32
00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.120
a Hanukkah tree or whatever where it's three different flashlights all attached

33
00:01:51.121 --> 00:01:53.880
to one handle.
Oh.
So you get like I'm in Nordic,

34
00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.930
switch gears to a mouth every now and then.
Yeah.

35
00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.210
And then when you hold it would actually look,
feel like a plastic girls.

36
00:02:00.211 --> 00:02:03.680
But two when you're fucking like the middle one.
So is there a mouth one?
Yes.

37
00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.950
Yeah.
Even like vampire mouth ones?
Yeah.

38
00:02:07.951 --> 00:02:12.440
Like their fags and shit.
Did they have Zombie resembles teeth?
Like yeah.
Yeah,

39
00:02:12.441 --> 00:02:16.080
yeah.
Well it's not hard.
No,
just the same.

40
00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.280
The same when it worked for me then yeah,
you like teeth.

41
00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.580
Anything like a little suffering.
Huge teeth.
Little Penguins.
Your pleasure.

42
00:02:23.581 --> 00:02:27.420
It's nice to let you know you're alive anyway.
Did most girls drag it?

43
00:02:27.421 --> 00:02:30.120
Their teeth on your Dick?
Like is that new?
Is that common?

44
00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.670
Cause it seems like it happens to me a lot.
And then I was thinking,

45
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.150
now I'm thinking maybe I just have a fat dick.
Whoa.
And it like,

46
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.430
cause like they always drag a whole joke.
No,
there's girls are angry with you.

47
00:02:41.431 --> 00:02:42.330
They're trying to punish you.

48
00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.700
They just can't believe they're actually sucking your Dick.
So you

49
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.400
chew on a little bit.

50
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.500
I think that's something normal to do that is you've had that happen to them.

51
00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.480
Well,
no.
It just seems like it's something that would happen,

52
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.430
but a lot like 99% at a time.
Maybe you date these little mild bitches,
right?

53
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:00.363
Yeah,
man.

54
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.840
<v 1>Maybe that's one of the things I look for in a girl's face were announced.</v>

55
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.660
We're also sponsored by Onnit.
Dot.
O.
N.
N I t.

56
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.670
Makers have such wonderful supplements as Alpha brain.
I take it all the time.

57
00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.530
I'm on it right now.
That's what makes my conversations flow so smoothly.

58
00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.830
Does it work?
Yeah,
it does work.
Yeah,
for sure.
Absolutely.
Works with me.

59
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.080
There's people who say it doesn't doe.
Everybody's different.

60
00:03:23.081 --> 00:03:26.950
Some people are allergic to peanuts.
You know,
the,
the human body is not,

61
00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.920
it's not equal.
Everybody doesn't get the same package,
you know,
so,

62
00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.100
which is unfortunate.
Yeah,
it is.
Yeah.
I mean,

63
00:03:33.101 --> 00:03:35.470
some be a lot easier die if they fucking,
you know,

64
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.880
eat certain foods that you love.
That's crazy.
Right?
It's really bizarre.

65
00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.640
The human body is a very strange animal.
Whatever the fucking has these,

66
00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.460
these are nutrients essentially that enhance cognitive function and uh,

67
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.390
it's all online.
You can,

68
00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:54.490
there's a page that was written by a medical editor of the science behind Alpha

69
00:03:55.061 --> 00:03:55.361
brain,

70
00:03:55.361 --> 00:03:59.980
and we're trying to clarify that up as much as possible and be as honest about

71
00:03:59.981 --> 00:04:02.470
the supplement as possible.
It's not limitless.

72
00:04:02.471 --> 00:04:04.000
It's not going to make you a super genius,

73
00:04:04.001 --> 00:04:07.060
but I think it makes my brain work better.
And it,

74
00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.690
these nootropics are stuff that are in it.
You can find them online.

75
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.210
I encourage people,
if you don't want to buy our shit,

76
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.290
just go find the ingredients that we have on line and make your own,
go,

77
00:04:17.291 --> 00:04:19.250
go buy the stuff wholesale.
You know,

78
00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:22.630
you'll save some money for sure if you don't want it to get a science degree.

79
00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.870
If you're in it.
Yeah,
it's just start manufacturing on equipment.

80
00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.220
Yeah,
lab coats or if you're not wearing that cup,
do not try and make your own.

81
00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.420
We have a bunch of different stuff.
We have Alpha brain,

82
00:04:34.421 --> 00:04:38.380
we have the southern less controversial things like new mood,

83
00:04:38.381 --> 00:04:43.000
which is a five HTP and the El Tryptofan enhancer send Burt crisis.

84
00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:44.700
None of that shit back and forth.

85
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.210
He was like an ice skating a lot that the fan,

86
00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.230
it'll trip to fans.
I was like a ice skating.

87
00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.030
He sounds like he's more Spanish than I skating.

88
00:04:56.031 --> 00:04:59.550
Beautiful trip to Penn and into it really.
And do a triple cows.

89
00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.650
Oh Gosh.
She just did a back to back shroom tech sport,
which is um,

90
00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.410
a quarter sibs,
mushroom supplement and the quarter subs.
Mushrooms is,

91
00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.240
it's a weird kind of an energy that it gives you.
It's really fun.
It's not,

92
00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.200
not like coffee.
It's like if you,
if you're in shape,

93
00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.110
if you're not a person works out.
I'd say skip this one.

94
00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:21.160
This is really not for you.

95
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.890
But if you're one of those people that works out really hard,

96
00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:28.190
which is shit gives you great.
And I really like guns and animal looking at me.

97
00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.700
Savage,
you don't get that beer just sitting around the house.

98
00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.510
You think you think any normal person can wear Carhartt vest?
Yeah,
man.

99
00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:40.180
With a white t shirt.
He's an animal.
Bam.
Anyway,

100
00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.240
go to Joe rogan.net.
Click on the Alpha brain link.

101
00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:48.270
Enter in the code name rug and get 10% off or not the end of commercials.

102
00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:53.770
Dunes in the house.
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're going to get the party started

103
00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:58.103
all day.

104
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:05.060
<v 2>That's a little wake up.
Come in and hot right there.
That's a little wake up.</v>

105
00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:08.090
Wake up.
It's those,
some of them drums,

106
00:06:08.091 --> 00:06:12.770
man fires up the synopsis.
Young Nick was at Drummond,
right,
right

107
00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:14.260
<v 0>there.
Uh,</v>

108
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:19.330
Brian to find people at app out there that forces and drummed Brian Garageband

109
00:06:19.371 --> 00:06:23.310
that it's actually now I actually have a band where we were called garage band.

110
00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.860
Then they came out with that whole software and we got,
oh,
that's brutal.
Screwed.

111
00:06:27.861 --> 00:06:30.830
Yeah.
Never called electronic.
Japan's amazing.
I mean,
Brian,

112
00:06:30.831 --> 00:06:34.970
you don't have any musical background,
right?
I make songs all the time,

113
00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:36.770
but the problem is that,
you know what I'm saying?
I mean,

114
00:06:36.771 --> 00:06:38.690
you never went to school for it,
anything,
right?
Yeah.

115
00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:42.570
But after a while you start hearing the same like melodies and like commercial

116
00:06:42.571 --> 00:06:47.390
and you just figured out how to use the software and you just started fucking

117
00:06:47.391 --> 00:06:51.000
around and just how to read music.
No,
no,
no.

118
00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:55.970
It's just that was just a combination of using different loops and then changing

119
00:06:55.971 --> 00:07:00.620
the sounds of the loops.
And then don't say your secrets.
You know,

120
00:07:00.621 --> 00:07:04.400
dude,
I've been,
I've been tripped out since we were a at your place,

121
00:07:04.401 --> 00:07:08.400
at your new studio and we were talking about that nine year old kid or what does

122
00:07:08.401 --> 00:07:12.870
he,
12 year old kid that is written five symphonies.
He and this guy,

123
00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:16.070
he was walking on the street how he's two years old.
He was writing music.

124
00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:20.180
Kid was two years old.
He was drawing pictures of Cellos and writing music.

125
00:07:20.181 --> 00:07:21.350
I don't even think it was two years old.

126
00:07:21.351 --> 00:07:25.850
Like these were like drawings and crayons and say how he's 10 now.
Yeah.

127
00:07:25.851 --> 00:07:30.740
Well now I think he's 12 or what is that?
Is that the truth?
Or is a 20 now?

128
00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:31.660
Maybe this is an older,

129
00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:36.050
I feel like he's 20 now and I feel like they said he'd been studying in Europe,

130
00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:39.740
so who knows how good he is or if he's gone completely bonkers.
Yeah.

131
00:07:39.741 --> 00:07:41.240
He's probably in his video,

132
00:07:41.241 --> 00:07:44.020
this poor kid was walking down the street and he was like skipping and,

133
00:07:44.021 --> 00:07:47.050
and like making music at the same time.
Like so,

134
00:07:47.051 --> 00:07:51.560
so happy and like just going happy.
Yeah.
I mean I want,
I said poor kid.
I mean,

135
00:07:51.561 --> 00:07:55.150
I just mean because what a burden to have that kind of genius,
you know,

136
00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:58.490
overflowing literally over whelming you,
I mean,

137
00:07:58.491 --> 00:08:00.230
you can't say that everybody is the same.

138
00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:03.010
When there's people like that that exists.
It's prime primes,

139
00:08:03.011 --> 00:08:06.200
the dust skydeck and what if you,
you know,
you get older,

140
00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:09.710
could we got them and you know,
you peaked at seven,
you know,

141
00:08:09.711 --> 00:08:12.020
like what if that would,
if that was the best possible,

142
00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:16.630
then that would be a tough thing to deal with.
Yeah.
Yeah man.

143
00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:19.550
Because usually people peak in that early part of their career when it comes to

144
00:08:19.551 --> 00:08:22.700
creativity,
I think.
Yeah.
Well,

145
00:08:22.701 --> 00:08:26.720
usually that's when you're the most pure and your intentions,
you know,
you,

146
00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:30.800
you really are focused.
You want that prize.
And then what happens?

147
00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:34.700
The trappings of fame set in and guys get fat,

148
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:37.900
Rock Stars get fat and it alters your mood.
It alters your mindset.

149
00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:40.740
Like when I had a day job or when I was working in the beginning and that get

150
00:08:40.741 --> 00:08:41.990
created,
this create,
you know,

151
00:08:41.991 --> 00:08:46.190
like it made me think on my feet more and want to stop doing that.
You know?

152
00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:46.910
And then once you get,

153
00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:50.930
you go through that phase of where the creativity changes comes from a different

154
00:08:50.931 --> 00:08:54.980
place.
Yeah.
Once you also know what stand up really is,
you know?
I mean,

155
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:58.200
I feel like it takes years to figure out what you're actually doing up there.

156
00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.560
Yeah.
But if this kid just starts off never doing anything about that,
yeah.

157
00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:06.600
He's gone up.
She retired at 14 five symphonies.
I mean,
it was amazing.

158
00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:10.050
And you know,
and he was playing his music.
It was,
I don't know,

159
00:09:10.051 --> 00:09:13.770
classical music for,
well,
I'm not really a fan,
but,
uh,
it,
it was,

160
00:09:13.771 --> 00:09:17.660
it sounded amazing.
You know,
I have a joke where I say this kid would,

161
00:09:17.661 --> 00:09:21.510
could use probably literally right before I play a song and I say is the first

162
00:09:21.511 --> 00:09:23.910
song I ever wrote.
And the first song I ever heard,

163
00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:27.360
I didn't want any influences like that.
That could be that kids,

164
00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:30.530
he never heard a song.
He just started making it.
It's crushing.

165
00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:32.580
Imagine it's fucking crazy.

166
00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:38.730
That's what a amazing ability.
She's got to know.
Is he good looking?

167
00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:43.100
Imagine if he has a giant hug to at 12 that's how it,

168
00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:47.990
that's how my friends,
that's all.
Imagine that for a sec.
Uber,
munch.

169
00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:52.380
Do you know Jonathan Daniel Brown?
See one of the kids from Tim Allen Shell.
Now.

170
00:09:52.381 --> 00:09:55.740
I know we've talked about it,
but it was it more than two names.

171
00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:59.330
Like what's going on.
I didn't always think that's him.
Yeah,
he's a,

172
00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:00.540
he's up Jonathan Taylor,

173
00:10:00.541 --> 00:10:04.420
Thomas Plato of,

174
00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:08.900
of celebrity volleyball game once,
a long time ago.
And,
uh,

175
00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:13.500
I got to see like that guy that Jonathan Taylor Thomas was on the Tim Allen show

176
00:10:13.501 --> 00:10:17.730
right when he was like,
he was young then,
you know,
he was probably like,

177
00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:19.450
I was young too.
I was like in my early,

178
00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:23.040
maybe mid twenties but he was a younger than me.

179
00:10:23.041 --> 00:10:26.970
I think he was like a young teenager and he was really famous,
you know,

180
00:10:26.971 --> 00:10:31.580
that the show is really popular and it was so weird out how the kid was,

181
00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:32.910
I was like,
you,

182
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000
he was like hit all this like crazy like confidence and all this like,

183
00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.180
you know,

184
00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:44.180
exuberance that comes from being a fucking television star before you've ever

185
00:10:45.031 --> 00:10:48.300
even evolved as a human being and to be that cute.
Yeah.

186
00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:51.930
To be cute and to be on just giant hit show.

187
00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:54.330
And I always remember thinking this because I'm,

188
00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:58.740
I have this thing where I do where if,
especially when I meet someone fucked up,

189
00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:02.040
I put them into my science project folder and I'm like,

190
00:11:02.041 --> 00:11:05.880
well where's this guy going to be in five years and 10 years?
Like what is,

191
00:11:05.881 --> 00:11:08.820
what is,
is his transition to reality?
Going to be like,

192
00:11:08.821 --> 00:11:11.040
cause right now he goes back to reality.
Yeah.

193
00:11:11.041 --> 00:11:14.070
Well you go back to it every now and then and go check in on him.
Yeah,
go,

194
00:11:14.071 --> 00:11:15.860
go and see.
Do you have like a liberal out them,

195
00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:19.410
like a list of people that alarm goes off check on.

196
00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:25.660
I had 2014 most of them you can't really check on too much and most of our girls

197
00:11:25.801 --> 00:11:26.560
are used to date.

198
00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:31.380
My friend has a note in his phone that's like bartender at the Improv.

199
00:11:31.381 --> 00:11:36.180
Dave old guy is well and he has like all the comedy clubs and everywhere.

200
00:11:36.181 --> 00:11:39.690
He just marks their name down by how they look.
And he always goes to that.

201
00:11:39.691 --> 00:11:43.860
I mean just like girl that you think as a manager's assistant,
Olivia,

202
00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.990
he just has this list.
It's Pete Holmes.

203
00:11:48.991 --> 00:11:52.670
I mean it's just out you,

204
00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:54.130
you see John Taylor Thomas

205
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:58.960
<v 2>on Twitter.
He has a hilarious Twitter,
John Taylor Thomas,</v>

206
00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:03.600
and he's a comedy purists that to who is,
has he ever retweeted me?
Uh,

207
00:12:03.601 --> 00:12:07.510
I'm sure he probably has.
I wonder who that could be.
He often fucks up really,

208
00:12:07.511 --> 00:12:12.511
really Jonathan Taylor Thomas as it verified [inaudible] corporation.

209
00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:18.280
We checked,
we checked the zero five right now if my page is verified,

210
00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:22.760
no it's not.
I'll verify it.
Is it?
Oh,
we'll just take a look at this.

211
00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:27.450
It's absolutely not.
Yes it is.
When did you guys done?
A while ago,
right?
Oh yeah.

212
00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:33.160
Do you have a Wikipedia page also too?
You got anything habit.
It's terrible.

213
00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:35.080
I need to go in there and he's angry.
He's angry.

214
00:12:35.081 --> 00:12:38.800
Someone that Wikipedia is not a Brian Fam.
They probably listened to the podcast.

215
00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:43.120
And if you listen to the podcast,
listen,
it's a very unique dynamic.
You know,

216
00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:46.990
I'm a strong cup of coffee and he blurts in with childish Shit Diet,
right?

217
00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:51.160
This is just what it is.
It's just what it is.
So together it works.

218
00:12:51.161 --> 00:12:54.040
But people get angry sometimes in him.
They get angry at him.

219
00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:56.980
And uh,
I think so

220
00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:04.270
sort of people keep putting stuff up,
dude.
I have to check people all the time,

221
00:13:04.271 --> 00:13:08.140
man.
On the,
especially on the message board,
I've added a few things.
Juniors,

222
00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:12.640
Douchey,
cubic good,
cheers,
attitudes,
Wikipedia.

223
00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:15.280
What did you add that took down?
You got took down.

224
00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:19.420
He could still do backflips why would they take that down?
I don't know.

225
00:13:19.421 --> 00:13:21.350
I did it for so I could reference it in a,

226
00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:23.900
in a like a bid I was going to do that night.

227
00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:27.130
You put it in Wikipedia so that you can do it on TV and then,

228
00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:30.360
cause I was doing the tonight show and I had a bit about them and I wanted this

229
00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:32.700
and I haven't a part of the thing.
I go to Wikipedia,

230
00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:36.580
he does all his own stunts and he's still can do back flips and so I've put them

231
00:13:36.581 --> 00:13:38.980
on and it got taken off before I did the show.
That's hilarious.

232
00:13:38.981 --> 00:13:40.540
When you get set up your own bits,

233
00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:43.980
you can set up your own bits by putting fake shit on someone's Wikipedia.

234
00:13:43.981 --> 00:13:48.520
How would you actually know if you could use it as a couch thing that night and

235
00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:52.150
we'll probably still be up.
Yeah,
totally.
That's a great idea.

236
00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:55.300
How hard is it to edit someone's Wikipedia edit button?

237
00:13:55.540 --> 00:14:00.490
How are they making any money?
Wikipedia make money.
Everyone uses it.

238
00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:04.860
No he doesn't.
He just uses donated.
It's actually pro bono.
Yeah.

239
00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:09.860
Is it a.org?
Yeah,
it is.
Really?

240
00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:14.320
Yeah.
Um,
did you know that the edge,

241
00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:18.380
the edge and new to his lawyers pro bono.
So if they ever break up

242
00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:24.253
pro bono,

243
00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:30.460
I said that at a radio station in Denver that Youtube was playing at the stadium

244
00:14:30.461 --> 00:14:33.310
the next week.
And I went in this guy named uncle nasty and I know that dude,

245
00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:38.470
he's super nice,
but I see these youtube posters all over the place and I go,
hey,

246
00:14:38.471 --> 00:14:41.500
did you see what has happened on Twitter?
There's live.
And he goes,
no,
what?

247
00:14:41.501 --> 00:14:45.760
And I go,
you two broke up.
And he goes,
what?
What are they gonna do?

248
00:14:45.761 --> 00:14:49.060
They're playing next week.
And he's like,
seriously?
Got In.
And then I did the,

249
00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:52.100
yeah,
and let the edges lawyers pro bono.
And he looked at

250
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:55.070
<v 3>me and he goes,
oh,
we're going to commercial.
And it guys,
he goes,
yeah,</v>

251
00:14:55.071 --> 00:14:56.200
you can't tell jokes like that.

252
00:14:57.130 --> 00:15:01.630
<v 4>You,
well you did it.
Just put people into a tailspin.</v>

253
00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:05.940
See these God damn to mania is to see this.
This is

254
00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:07.920
<v 3>mind of a standup comic.</v>

255
00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:11.100
They were just telling me this trick that they played on Brendan Walsh.

256
00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:15.120
Are you allowed to?
No,
I don't want to.
No,
no,

257
00:15:15.121 --> 00:15:18.930
because then they'll just hope he'll fire back in the late.
He's scared,

258
00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:21.120
but it's funny.
I thought this whole thing was a prank.

259
00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.700
I thought you did tell the story,
man.

260
00:15:23.701 --> 00:15:26.280
It's hard to say what I thought because I don't want to say the prank we did on

261
00:15:26.281 --> 00:15:30.810
him because that's a lie,
because he outdid somebody else on a,
in a thing where,

262
00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:34.110
and then you just like,
did he agree with that guy that he wanted that story out?

263
00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:36.480
Why wouldn't you want it?
The story I was telling me,
it's humbling.

264
00:15:36.481 --> 00:15:40.200
He doesn't even,
people would go up to him.
He wouldn't even tell him.
Oh,

265
00:15:40.201 --> 00:15:44.100
and it was a,
you're crazy.
That's a whole area story.
Brendan Walsh,
his whole act,

266
00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:47.550
he talks about doing pranks,
but his buddies doing pranks does wife,

267
00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:50.450
he closes with that bid.
That hilarious.
Bitty done.
Yeah.
Yeah.

268
00:15:50.451 --> 00:15:55.290
And he outdid Chris Banks on it.
Tell the bit,
son,
give it up.
What happened?

269
00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:56.670
Well.
All right.

270
00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:57.573
<v 4>I knew</v>

271
00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:05.320
no,
because first of all,
start tweeting at him right away.

272
00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:13.080
<v 3>Our friend before we sell bad Brendan Walsh is fun.
I carious I can't out it.</v>

273
00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:17.940
He's a hilarious comedian.
But Brendan Walsh is a Goddamn trickster.

274
00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:20.040
He's a prankster and he does crazy shit.

275
00:16:20.041 --> 00:16:24.210
Like he made wholefoods signs and put them out with solely,
it was hilarious.

276
00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:27.630
We've got all these people thinking that whole foods was coming to silver lake.

277
00:16:27.631 --> 00:16:31.860
They were all excited.
I heard the rumors from other people.
I got my dog park.

278
00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:34.640
People were like to hear whole foods is coming in.
Yeah,
there's a sign up,

279
00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:37.620
you know,
people for two weeks.
And then did you hear it was a prank?

280
00:16:37.621 --> 00:16:41.300
It was like a major,
why wouldn't wholefoods build one there?
No one.

281
00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:44.340
Exactly smarter.
The Los Angeles Times reached out to them.

282
00:16:44.341 --> 00:16:46.550
There was like everyone reached out to them and they gave uh,

283
00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:49.470
a statement saying we are not planning on building.
So they,

284
00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:54.000
that's like Brendan's joke went that far.
So great.
Well,
so anyway,

285
00:16:54.001 --> 00:16:58.260
Brendon is constantly doing shit like that.
Like playing pranks.
Yeah.

286
00:16:58.261 --> 00:17:00.840
And he pranked me that I,
he,
he pranked.
Um,

287
00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:04.980
he got somebody else to tweet with them.
Congrats to Nick Thune about SNL.

288
00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:09.060
And I'd actually audition for SNL a while before that,
which he didn't know,

289
00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:11.250
you know,
Lacey says,
and uh,

290
00:17:11.251 --> 00:17:14.190
I just started getting tons of emails and people were retweeting it and some

291
00:17:14.191 --> 00:17:18.330
comedy blogs picked it up and I didn't get SNL and all of a sudden I'm getting

292
00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:23.160
eat.
Like just congratulations my dad.
I mean,
it's that easy.

293
00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:26.410
Yeah,
it's,
and,
and it's so easy to spread.

294
00:17:26.610 --> 00:17:31.320
I had to give a statement to somebody saying it was,
I guess he wins if he got,

295
00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:33.820
if people have to give press statements.
Yeah.
He won and,

296
00:17:33.821 --> 00:17:38.190
and wash and he manipulates billboards.
He added himself to like a big,

297
00:17:38.191 --> 00:17:41.340
like that's my favorite blog to a top chef thing.

298
00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:46.530
He took a picture of himself stirring a ball and got it to scale,

299
00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:49.413
to scale.

300
00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:54.780
<v 2>It was so fun.
It just makes me,</v>

301
00:17:54.781 --> 00:17:57.900
can we just add it into this billboard and you got a job.
I mean,

302
00:17:57.901 --> 00:18:00.600
it's a super small,
but it's still six feet tall,
right?
Yeah.

303
00:18:00.601 --> 00:18:03.510
And he had made and he had a fucking big laminate made me,

304
00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:09.230
he climbed up onto a phone cord and he had like a meeting and I love that guy.

305
00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:10.940
Get a meeting in front of your diet.

306
00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:14.860
<v 3>They were talking in a room and out of the window there was a billboard and he</v>

307
00:18:14.861 --> 00:18:17.250
had mentioned,
he pointed it out to them in the meeting set,

308
00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:20.380
like setting himself up.
A callback pointed out the billboard.

309
00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:24.430
Then that night snuck out there and added a joke to it.
I don't know what it was.

310
00:18:24.431 --> 00:18:27.500
There was something he said and in the next day they walk out and they like text

311
00:18:27.501 --> 00:18:29.230
him like we just saw.
Brilliant.

312
00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:34.870
<v 2>That's hilarious.
What a great idea he has that.
He's a,</v>

313
00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:37.260
he's on the edge though because you know,
just kind of day.
I mean,

314
00:18:37.261 --> 00:18:39.210
that's some dangerous stuff.
You can get hurt,

315
00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:43.260
you know when you're climbing up on billboards,
that's scary.
Shit.
Dudes fall off.

316
00:18:43.261 --> 00:18:47.490
Those things.
They die.
Yeah,
but he didn't fall off.
No,

317
00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:51.150
he's still alive,
unfortunately.
He's still out there.

318
00:18:51.151 --> 00:18:54.150
And you can still prank at any moment.
A dude's awesome.
So what'd you do to him?

319
00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:59.070
Oh God.
Well I think it's worth it.
I think it's funny.
Yeah,
it is funny.

320
00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:02.820
It's fucking hilarious.
Go for it.
It's just setting me up to get it even worse.

321
00:19:02.821 --> 00:19:07.380
Listen the way back.
I think he would [inaudible] it's already in motion.

322
00:19:07.381 --> 00:19:10.860
I can't believe you even worried about the dot talking about this is nothing

323
00:19:10.861 --> 00:19:13.380
compared to where you actually did.
Yeah,
you're right.
You're right.

324
00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:17.850
Cause this is more like building up what the guy too.
So,
but yeah,

325
00:19:17.851 --> 00:19:19.370
he needs this them.

326
00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:21.070
<v 3>So I was waiting to get them back</v>

327
00:19:22.690 --> 00:19:27.640
and we were at a Conan because our friend John Doerr and Rory Scovel work and

328
00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:31.330
um,
do a standup at where Conan,
it's like,
you know,
we messed up,

329
00:19:31.331 --> 00:19:32.860
we actually double booked Comedians,

330
00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:34.720
but they both agreed to come out at the same time.

331
00:19:34.721 --> 00:19:37.750
So they go out and they do like,
it was really funny.
You can Google that,

332
00:19:37.751 --> 00:19:39.520
people that are watching.
But uh,

333
00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:43.300
I went to watch it live and I was hanging out and somebody said that Brennan was

334
00:19:43.301 --> 00:19:47.540
coming,
Walsh.
And I said,
well,
we got to prank him if he's not here yet.
We got,

335
00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:49.430
we all got a band together,
it'll a,

336
00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:53.860
so we figured something out really quickly and put it into motion right away

337
00:19:53.861 --> 00:19:58.510
with the production of Conan involved.
Um,
and when he showed up,
I just said,
hey,

338
00:19:58.511 --> 00:20:00.850
I don't know if I was outside having a cigarette.
And I was like,
if,

339
00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:04.720
I don't know if he talked to JP had been,
he wanted to talk to you.
And he goes,

340
00:20:04.721 --> 00:20:08.380
uh,
you know,
he goes looking for him.
He runs into John Doerr.
John Doerr is like,

341
00:20:08.381 --> 00:20:12.700
you gotta talk to JP.
So he gets up to him and he goes,
I'm actually shit,

342
00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:15.130
I shouldn't say producers' names.
I'm not going to say it again.

343
00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:19.840
<v 2>[inaudible] going to say it again.</v>

344
00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:23.770
It's live.
So,
you know,
um,

345
00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:26.550
<v 3>great.
Can you edit that out in the next [inaudible]</v>

346
00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:31.160
<v 2>oh,
it's on the internet,
Bro.
Dr For parties.
Yeah.
So the person and</v>

347
00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:35.270
<v 3>involve said,
uh,
hey,
there's a sketch we want you to do.
And he said,
um,</v>

348
00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:36.470
what is it?
And he goes,
well,

349
00:20:36.471 --> 00:20:39.050
you have to shave half your beard and dressed like Harry Potter.

350
00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:41.840
And the part that we messed up because it actually,

351
00:20:41.841 --> 00:20:45.010
it was like we told them that there was money involved.
Um,
he goes,

352
00:20:45.011 --> 00:20:46.400
is their money?
And they said,
yeah,
it pays.

353
00:20:46.401 --> 00:20:48.280
And so they just went right into motion.

354
00:20:48.281 --> 00:20:50.860
Brendan went into a go get his half as beard,

355
00:20:50.861 --> 00:20:55.270
shaved off and makeup and I wanted to go take a picture.
This is how cut,

356
00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:57.010
this is how much the crew there was into it.

357
00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:59.560
I go in and take a picture of him with a half a beard and the guy goes,

358
00:20:59.561 --> 00:21:03.700
no time for pictures.
We got to get them in wardrobe.
Now there's this wardrobe,

359
00:21:03.701 --> 00:21:04.930
guys were running up to wardrobe.

360
00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:06.880
They'd get them in this beautiful Harry Potter outfit

361
00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:11.350
and he comes down to the green room and now it's just waiting.
You know,

362
00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:15.100
all he knows his beard,
Harry Potter,
somebody comes in a producer,

363
00:21:15.101 --> 00:21:19.210
they have him sign a w nine w whatever,
40 w two foot,

364
00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:24.490
the 40 wd forties.
So I mean,
now it's like,
it's obviously real,

365
00:21:24.491 --> 00:21:28.300
there's paperwork involved.
Um,
then this kid comes in and they've got,

366
00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:30.760
we've got people calling him Walter,
this was John Doors idea,

367
00:21:30.761 --> 00:21:33.270
which was probably the funniest part was that,
um,

368
00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:37.480
so was always call him Walter no matter what.
And so people were like,

369
00:21:37.481 --> 00:21:38.410
we're always saying Walter.

370
00:21:38.411 --> 00:21:43.411
And he finally was like responding to Walter because it was such a hassle

371
00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:46.780
telling people his name wasn't Walter.
Um,

372
00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:49.840
so this kid comes in and he's like flipping through these scripts and he's got a

373
00:21:49.841 --> 00:21:53.680
headset on and he's obviously like a pa that just like playing and that wants to

374
00:21:53.681 --> 00:21:58.030
be an actor.
And he goes,
so Walter in here,
and Brendan goes,
yeah,
Walter.
Correct.

375
00:21:58.031 --> 00:22:00.940
Anyone?
Yeah,
he was,
he started correcting people.
Then he stopped.

376
00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:02.680
But they just kill it with the same people.

377
00:22:02.681 --> 00:22:04.940
Can they give you God's Brennan and they wouldn't say anything.
Yes,

378
00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:06.720
but this isn't saying anything.

379
00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:14.400
That was John Doerr.
John Doerr is a genius.
Oh,
that's hilarious.
And so on.

380
00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:19.310
And so I'm now at this point,
Brennan,
you know,

381
00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:23.920
wants to see a script and this kid goes,
can you read cue cards?
And he goes,
yeah,

382
00:22:23.921 --> 00:22:27.530
but I'd like to see a script.
You know,
I want to see what we're doing here.
And,

383
00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:33.400
and he got,
the kid just goes,
okay,
and runs.
So no answer to his question.
Nothing.

384
00:22:33.401 --> 00:22:35.890
Now he knows that he's probably going to have cue cards is even know what the

385
00:22:35.891 --> 00:22:37.840
bid is.
He's not happy at this point.

386
00:22:37.841 --> 00:22:40.450
Like now at this point he's taken the circle glasses off and he's just

387
00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:46.000
not happy.
The show starts,
he knows it's in the first segment.

388
00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:48.530
Conan,

389
00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:51.700
we can see in the TV that Conan's already out doing the monologue and this woman

390
00:22:51.701 --> 00:22:55.930
comes in and she goes,
is there a Walter in here?
And he goes,
yeah.
And she goes,

391
00:22:55.931 --> 00:22:57.310
the Harry Potter sketch has been cut.

392
00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:04.830
Did you see his face when this happened?
Yeah,
we haven't.

393
00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:07.180
We have a video video.

394
00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:11.740
He walked out straight to the producer and he goes,
um,

395
00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:14.230
they just told me this sketch was cut.
And he goes,
well,

396
00:23:14.231 --> 00:23:15.790
I think that's what happens in late night TV.

397
00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:18.020
Did you should edit that and put that cone.

398
00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:21.360
And he goes and he turns around and any,

399
00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:25.550
and he sees me and John Doerr just filming him from behind and just that's

400
00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:29.230
brilliant.
Not happy that he was angry for like,
you know,

401
00:23:29.231 --> 00:23:32.020
initially it's like a burn.
I think that he started thinking,

402
00:23:32.021 --> 00:23:34.030
he started saying stuff like,
this isn't a prank because it,

403
00:23:34.031 --> 00:23:36.850
but I think you'd always go back to the fact that there was paperwork.

404
00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:40.290
It was real and that was probably the biggest mistake is it's some,

405
00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:41.750
somebody at an administration was,

406
00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:45.980
do you guys that video,
that's a work

407
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:50.840
<v 2>of art.
Burleson Brendan as a prankster has to just accept his defeat.
Well,</v>

408
00:23:50.841 --> 00:23:54.500
and Duncan trussell's emailed me about giving his my info to you guys for the

409
00:23:54.501 --> 00:23:58.370
podcast and I responded to the email.
Tell Brendan,
nice try.

410
00:23:59.630 --> 00:24:02.510
Never said,
never said give him my contact info.

411
00:24:02.511 --> 00:24:04.080
And then when you guys called me yesterday,

412
00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:06.410
I had that debt he's definitely involved with,

413
00:24:06.411 --> 00:24:08.600
I was going to show up and they're just going to get out of the video camera and

414
00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:13.360
just say,
yeah,
he just drove an hour and nothing.
That's hilarious.
Enjoy.

415
00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:16.910
Enjoy Russia.
That's hilarious.
Yeah.
You're out.

416
00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:18.710
Come out to the mound committee bill.

417
00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:22.220
What he said when he did an a in another podcast when he talked about pranking

418
00:24:22.221 --> 00:24:22.850
people,

419
00:24:22.850 --> 00:24:27.140
he said that he only pranks people that he loves and that and that came from the

420
00:24:27.141 --> 00:24:29.330
same thing from us.
But with him,
you know,
he's such a good friend.

421
00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:30.380
We know that we could do that,

422
00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:34.160
but I'm also saying that so that if he listens to this,
we'd love you Brandon.

423
00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:36.890
You'd have to know that you can't get me back to bad.

424
00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:39.530
You gotta to be more.

425
00:24:39.531 --> 00:24:42.550
Now you've got a tweet pictures at least of Brendan that you have on your phone

426
00:24:42.551 --> 00:24:46.880
list.
Notice Brendan,
you are exposed any of it.

427
00:24:46.881 --> 00:24:50.540
You can't have only your victories available for the public to see like the

428
00:24:50.541 --> 00:24:54.180
photos of your whole foods sign.
You have to have your losses.
Yeah.

429
00:24:54.181 --> 00:24:56.660
This is the game he plays and he took a loss.

430
00:24:56.780 --> 00:25:00.960
And you're supposed to put that video online.
Yes.
I think it's,

431
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.540
I think we have that video waiting.

432
00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:07.790
You know that video is just there in case he decides to get me back.
Oh,

433
00:25:07.791 --> 00:25:11.000
it's so crazy.
He should be requesting that he should be required.

434
00:25:11.001 --> 00:25:11.930
He's never asked about it.

435
00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:14.870
He's never asked about the videos and that's the thing I admire about the guy.

436
00:25:14.871 --> 00:25:19.760
He,
he uh,
he plays straight and he keeps his head,
neck,

437
00:25:19.770 --> 00:25:22.300
dad's video online.
You God.

438
00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:25.610
Otherwise the whole game is a sham.

439
00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:28.580
You got to edit it and give it to Conan and then so you can put it on.

440
00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:32.930
That's not a bad idea.
It's funny we'll be on we,
yeah,
we'd actually,

441
00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:36.110
nobody gets hurt.
We get that second day,
right?
Yeah.

442
00:25:36.111 --> 00:25:39.500
If he was smart and he was thinking of suing,
that's,

443
00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:43.480
that would be the motivation presented as a sketch.
To me,

444
00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:47.510
that's not a bad idea to put it back on the show.
That's from the show.

445
00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:49.040
Cause then it pays the whole thing.

446
00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:52.160
I would really give me kind of funny call in and could work with,
you know,

447
00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:54.980
I don't want to do this,
but my lawyers are making me,
you know,

448
00:25:54.981 --> 00:25:58.640
like it can actually be funny.
That's a funny I did for a sketch.

449
00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.460
Why don't you do that man?
Make them,
I should edit it with,
with tech.

450
00:26:02.530 --> 00:26:04.550
I wouldn't do it.
I want to do it without permission.

451
00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:09.110
I even feel bad about talking about without permission because it,
oh my God,

452
00:26:09.111 --> 00:26:12.450
listen,
if he doesn't give you permission,
then what is he?
No,

453
00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:16.970
he wouldn't not give permission,
but as a respectable,
listen,

454
00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:19.010
Brendan Walsh is a bad motherfucker.

455
00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:23.330
Ultimately he's going to have to accept that he got them and then it's
hilarious.

456
00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:26.240
It's going to come back so much.

457
00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:29.270
It's going to come back so much deeper and so trust me,

458
00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:31.880
it's going to come back so hard.
Yeah.
I don't even trust.

459
00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:34.100
I think Rory Scovel after it happened,
he goes,

460
00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:38.080
I might just show up and my fiance will be gone.
I don't know why.
Right.

461
00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:41.510
He's capable of,
I don't know.
Can you call a truce?

462
00:26:41.511 --> 00:26:44.280
Do you think it will accept a truce?
Um,
are you even

463
00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:47.570
<v 5>now when you feel like you even does that SNL?
That's pretty rude.</v>

464
00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:50.010
That would be more because I did another thing to him once where he was,

465
00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:54.590
<v 3>I knew that these people were having a,
a lemonade stand and he was at it.</v>

466
00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:57.890
He's other comedians and silver lake and I went as meeting with somebody,

467
00:26:57.891 --> 00:27:00.980
like a meeting,
a writing meeting,
and I picked him up and just said,
hey,

468
00:27:00.981 --> 00:27:01.431
get in the car,

469
00:27:01.431 --> 00:27:04.850
we're going to buy water balloons and we're just going to water balloon the shit

470
00:27:04.851 --> 00:27:07.640
out of this mum and aid stand.
And so we,
we had,

471
00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:11.540
we pulled up and had three guys in the back and everything and this guy puts his

472
00:27:11.541 --> 00:27:13.280
head out the window goes,
hey,
how much does the lemonade,

473
00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:18.040
and they got 25 cents of before they finished.
Just started railing them with,

474
00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:21.380
with water balloons in painful and to the point where it was like,
all right,

475
00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:25.760
I've definitely made myself vulnerable to getting multiple bad things done to me

476
00:27:25.761 --> 00:27:26.594
for my friends.

477
00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:30.470
<v 5>Yeah.
That sets it up.
That starts it up.
Yeah.</v>

478
00:27:30.471 --> 00:27:32.170
Especially when they're in their clothes and they like talking to,

479
00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:35.810
they were holding their iPhone while we are adults.

480
00:27:35.811 --> 00:27:39.200
We have adult things with us and water ballooning isn't always part of that.

481
00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:43.040
So how many times do you guys got him back and forth?
Just a couple.

482
00:27:43.910 --> 00:27:48.510
Do you think it's possible to call a truce?
Who's he?
Who's at right now?
Yeah,

483
00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:50.840
I wouldn't mind.
Maybe we call him up right now and call it truth.

484
00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:52.970
Do you feel like,
and wish we had the capability,

485
00:27:52.971 --> 00:27:55.910
we've never set up the capability to take phone calls.
Speakerphone.

486
00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:59.800
Well we know Mike,
you can do that.
You get your phone.
Yeah,
call him up.

487
00:28:03.050 --> 00:28:04.340
I love,
we love Brendan,

488
00:28:04.341 --> 00:28:09.341
but I just text Brendan I guess has to be on this has to be on the Internet.

489
00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:12.140
I text him.
Ken,
Nick Thune play your beard prank.

490
00:28:12.141 --> 00:28:16.210
Holly Harry Potter video on Conan.
Conan.
Sorry.

491
00:28:16.610 --> 00:28:19.490
Well don't even say Ancona Cause who knows if Colin wants to have anything to do

492
00:28:19.491 --> 00:28:24.230
with it.
Well I want you to tweet team Coco does team coco answers tweets.

493
00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:25.840
Yeah,
they're really,
do I have to,

494
00:28:25.850 --> 00:28:29.910
can I just put them on speaker right away or not to ask his permission?
Uh,
yeah,

495
00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:32.540
he just tell desk squatter.
Tell him right away.
Yeah,

496
00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:37.590
he's got a lot on our podcast is on Brian's a podcast network that's called the

497
00:28:38.751 --> 00:28:43.280
bone zone.
Ryan,
Anna,
Anna.
See the fact that he hasn't even told you that story.

498
00:28:43.281 --> 00:28:44.690
It shows you,
when did this happen?

499
00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:47.180
<v 3>Four or five months ago.</v>

500
00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:52.160
<v 5>Oh,
how dare he.
Four or five months.
He has,
no,
he doesn't.</v>

501
00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:56.990
Oh my God.
He just wrote back.
Fuck you.
Seriously.
Fuck you.
Oh really?

502
00:28:57.880 --> 00:28:59.500
Oh,
Brian's fines.
Goofin

503
00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:04.340
terrified.
Oh my God.

504
00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:11.840
Shows his power.
Oh my God.
He's a serious man.
That,

505
00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:16.820
<v 6>thank you for calling me.
Leave me a message.</v>

506
00:29:18.510 --> 00:29:21.570
<v 5>That's a really nice voice mail message as it's solid.
Good voicing.</v>

507
00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:24.000
He's probably watching this live.

508
00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:27.460
<v 6>Haha.
Oh,
for delivery option.</v>

509
00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:31.790
<v 3>What's the delivery options anyways?
You could say hey,</v>

510
00:29:32.150 --> 00:29:35.150
it's meaning soon.
Um,
I just wanted to see if we,

511
00:29:35.151 --> 00:29:38.270
I'm on the podcast right now on the Joe Rogan experience and um,

512
00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:41.090
just wanted to see if we can get an on air prank.

513
00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:45.100
<v 5>Yeah.
We want to call it truce ban.
Yeah.
That was Joe.</v>

514
00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:47.050
Guys don't need to be going after each other like this.

515
00:29:47.150 --> 00:29:49.510
Concentrate in new careers.
It's a person.

516
00:29:49.511 --> 00:29:51.950
It's the first online prank trees ever happened.
Live in a pod.

517
00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:56.500
Concentrated your relationships.
Get it together or not,
or not.

518
00:29:56.501 --> 00:29:59.070
Or keep it going,
but let us use the video ease.

519
00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:03.910
I actually at work right now here.
I wrote back what Conan question mark.

520
00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:04.840
So yeah,

521
00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:13.120
to it happening?
You don't think so.
So you have the video?
We do.
We do.

522
00:30:13.330 --> 00:30:18.190
Multiple people have it.
We had,
it was like a six camera shoot.
Whoa.
Yeah.
Awesome.

523
00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:20.700
That's whole areas with lots of it.

524
00:30:20.701 --> 00:30:23.560
How long did it take for you guys to plan this in the dressing room alone?

525
00:30:23.561 --> 00:30:25.900
We had iPhones just set up around the room filming,

526
00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:30.130
so it was all like randomly like they were placed and we were also like taking

527
00:30:30.131 --> 00:30:32.150
pictures.
He was posing.
He was,

528
00:30:32.170 --> 00:30:35.750
he was glad handing and does so he was glad him.

529
00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:39.640
Oh my God,
Jesus Christ.

530
00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:42.940
How long did it take for you guys to plan this out?

531
00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:47.110
Just five less than five minutes.
Then it was really happening as it went.
Oh,

532
00:30:47.111 --> 00:30:49.930
so you did a little bit of ad libbing.
Yeah,
it was.
A lot of it was,
oh,

533
00:30:49.931 --> 00:30:50.830
so the Walter thing,

534
00:30:51.250 --> 00:30:54.730
Lori and John Doerr was so involved and they were seriously going on Conan.

535
00:30:54.790 --> 00:30:58.360
I mean there was up to them about to go on stage when I was like,
Hey,
I'm,

536
00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:02.560
I feel really bad about what we did.
And they're like,
and JP.
He's like,

537
00:31:02.561 --> 00:31:07.390
why don't we let them focus on their performance at this point and a tough stop

538
00:31:07.391 --> 00:31:12.130
pranking people.
Jesus Christ.
That's the problem with comedians.

539
00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:16.150
Even with a really important job like working for Conan.

540
00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:19.930
Ultimately if you're a comedian,
you're kind of a bit of a fuck up.

541
00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:22.900
My Dad was a prank or when when I was younger he would like put,

542
00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:26.290
we would go on family vacation and my uncle Rod would come and my dad would

543
00:31:26.650 --> 00:31:30.190
stick.
I'm dirty diapers like the day that everybody was leaving and my younger

544
00:31:30.191 --> 00:31:33.400
brothers are dog shit from my,
our dog and it was a suitcase

545
00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:38.350
and then he would get home.
My mom would get my mom's brother,

546
00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:41.680
I don't even know if he called that pranking.
That's just rude.

547
00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:47.920
Well it is ranking.
You know,
it's kind of a poetic Brendan,
just text.
I'm working.

548
00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:51.910
Yeah.
Yeah.
It is a prank.
People.
It's sort of a prank.

549
00:31:52.690 --> 00:31:55.330
People get on Brendan Walsh given on them on Twitter,

550
00:31:57.010 --> 00:32:01.300
get on him
in his video.
He's a great guy.

551
00:32:01.490 --> 00:32:03.580
I'm just scared of him.
You scared of retribution?

552
00:32:03.610 --> 00:32:07.270
I'm pretty sure if it was played on and that he would totally say yes.

553
00:32:07.330 --> 00:32:08.140
I'm pretty.

554
00:32:08.140 --> 00:32:11.830
Unless there's something weird at Man pod Harry Potter thing that he doesn't

555
00:32:11.831 --> 00:32:15.880
like,
but that's hilarious.
Wouldn't you saying if it's on Kona,

556
00:32:15.881 --> 00:32:17.960
but it doesn't need to be on Conan,
just tell him the internet.
No,
no.

557
00:32:17.961 --> 00:32:20.110
I'm gonna say,
but that would be awesome for him.

558
00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:22.270
And that's something that I think Conan would totally do.

559
00:32:22.330 --> 00:32:24.370
I think even just have it on the Internet and it would get,

560
00:32:24.430 --> 00:32:25.540
let's get Conan on the phone.

561
00:32:26.810 --> 00:32:30.700
Texting my dad helps him.
He had like a pant when he was young.

562
00:32:30.701 --> 00:32:33.890
He had like a pant,
they ripped pants.
People just pull it bad.
So yeah,

563
00:32:34.090 --> 00:32:36.670
it's the oldest trick in the book,
but it's most of the time,

564
00:32:36.671 --> 00:32:39.370
the most funny thing you could ever do to anybody.
Yeah.

565
00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:41.900
Especially as guys get older to develop guts.

566
00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:45.730
Their parents are barely hanging on anyway.
My Dad and he saw,
they're handsome.

567
00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:48.000
My Dad and godfather would,
we'd have,

568
00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:51.170
they would pass each other and in awkward situations and it was just kind of

569
00:32:51.171 --> 00:32:53.870
like,
who knows when it's going to do next?
And I have twin brothers,

570
00:32:53.871 --> 00:32:57.200
so one of them is like my dad holding my twin brothers in a grocery store and

571
00:32:57.201 --> 00:33:02.180
him just coming up from behind and he's checking out silly.
Wow.
He,
Brendan Walsh,

572
00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:05.960
I was totally wrong.
He wrote back,
I'm at rehearsal.

573
00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:10.460
Fuck that shit.
Zody said,
oh,
okay.

574
00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:13.790
He said,
I'm at rehearsal.
Fuck that shit.

575
00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:19.870
He's mad at you,
dude.
I know.

576
00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:23.540
That's why I said in the beginning I did not want to do it,
but wow.

577
00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:27.080
You know what I,
every time I'm sitting out to do a podcast on the way there,

578
00:33:27.081 --> 00:33:29.320
I say to myself something that good that you wouldn't share.

579
00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:31.970
I would say to myself on the way to every podcast,
remember,

580
00:33:31.971 --> 00:33:34.780
you don't have to say everything of your life.
There's some things,

581
00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:39.800
because I've already got,
I got in trouble on another podcast podcast on,
um,

582
00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:44.870
comedy,
Bang,
Bang.
What'd you do?
Talk about my neighbor.
How'd you get in trouble?

583
00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:49.880
Because my neighbor heard it.
I play the audio,

584
00:33:49.881 --> 00:33:51.680
I played audio of him in his pack.

585
00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:58.080
I'm the worst person you played on you.

586
00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:04.270
What was he doing?
It's,
I can't even,
I ha,
it's to the point where I can't,

587
00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:05.980
I should,
I probably shouldn't have brought it up.
Well,

588
00:34:06.030 --> 00:34:08.900
you [inaudible] get in trouble.
It's like,

589
00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:12.500
give us a king was I was out of line and it was funny and it was like a funny

590
00:34:12.501 --> 00:34:14.230
bit and he liked it.
And then,
um,

591
00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:17.090
his wife didn't like it that much because he played it for her after he heard it

592
00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:22.870
and I was stupid and I said his name and everything.
Oh Dude,
boom,
boom,
boom.

593
00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:27.130
She,
I did some,
I did something bad.
They went back and cut it out of the podcast.

594
00:34:27.131 --> 00:34:27.964
So we were really nice about it.

595
00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:31.970
I remember when I was talking about the girl at the tanning salon a long time

596
00:34:31.971 --> 00:34:32.810
ago,
I think her,

597
00:34:32.811 --> 00:34:35.340
one of her friends must have listened to the podcast or something or,

598
00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:40.160
or said something to her because now she came like a month ago or two months
ago.

599
00:34:40.170 --> 00:34:42.590
I don't think I've ever said this.
What was the girl at the Tanning Salon?

600
00:34:42.591 --> 00:34:43.424
What was the story again?

601
00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:47.690
She was super high and that every time I'd go there and Tan I would just
fucking,

602
00:34:47.810 --> 00:34:50.540
you know,
I'll try to masturbate to her while I'm getting a Tan.

603
00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:55.910
I mean she just fucking high.
Yeah.
Well she said something to me,

604
00:34:55.911 --> 00:34:59.570
she's like,
hey,
keep your hands away from your parts or something stupid.

605
00:34:59.571 --> 00:35:01.870
Like she said something like that wouldn't I was,
she's like,
alright,

606
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.820
number room number 11 keep your hands away from your parts.
Oh,

607
00:35:04.821 --> 00:35:08.220
rule number 11 or room number 11 oh yeah,
room number.

608
00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:10.460
And she just kind of threw that in at the end and I just walk and go,

609
00:35:10.461 --> 00:35:14.030
what the heck?
What was the first 10 rules?
Yeah,
it was like this.
I got confused.

610
00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:18.700
Yeah,
that's hilarious.
So basically she's saying she wants some deck one.

611
00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:22.610
Now I,
there's this little latch,
there's just like a little fishing hook.

612
00:35:22.810 --> 00:35:25.670
I just keep that undone now.
Like on the door,

613
00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:28.970
like when you shut the door there's that little latch where it's like a little

614
00:35:28.971 --> 00:35:31.250
hook that goes into the hole in a door lock.

615
00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:33.830
I just keep that unlocked and just shut the door.
And just in case,

616
00:35:33.910 --> 00:35:36.680
oh this listen to what happened to me last week.
I was,

617
00:35:37.130 --> 00:35:41.130
I don't even know what the fuck you just said just in case for what if she is

618
00:35:41.131 --> 00:35:43.320
interested in getting some Dick while I'm tanning.

619
00:35:43.321 --> 00:35:48.030
I'm keeping that door and lock.
So you still go to the same place?
Of course.

620
00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:52.020
I didn't even know you tan.
How often need tam?
Once every month.
Two months.

621
00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:56.250
Really?
It's relaxing.
Plus it's,
I don't know.
I don't,

622
00:35:56.400 --> 00:36:00.000
I think it's a new nap when you tend to get vitamin D out of those tanning

623
00:36:00.001 --> 00:36:01.520
salons.
Like you do other son.

624
00:36:02.170 --> 00:36:05.840
Yeah and I like she in California cause you could just go outside and lay out.

625
00:36:05.841 --> 00:36:06.674
Right.

626
00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:12.240
We know that that's like been shown to improve endurance that when you get

627
00:36:12.451 --> 00:36:16.590
tanned like a lot of fighters tan right before they fight cause it actually

628
00:36:16.591 --> 00:36:19.990
improves your endurance and that crazy and they look better.
Yeah.

629
00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:21.380
What actually it might,

630
00:36:21.450 --> 00:36:24.660
it might have a bunch of other effects too with the B six that your body

631
00:36:24.661 --> 00:36:28.860
produces when you're,
uh,
when you're tanning.
Apparently it's a,

632
00:36:28.861 --> 00:36:33.540
it's like amazing for your health nuts cause we've always been told to stay out

633
00:36:33.541 --> 00:36:38.190
of the sun because he get cancer,
right?
Yeah.
Then Seattle,
cause where I'm from,

634
00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:41.820
they promote tanning as in like you need to get because you have a 40 days

635
00:36:41.821 --> 00:36:46.160
without sign up there.
Yeah.
Oh,
so the decoding just for health.
That's what,
yeah,

636
00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:48.510
I mean that's probably,
that's part of what they're saying and that,
you know,

637
00:36:48.511 --> 00:36:51.030
like the tanning salon,
I asked her,
we went back to sleep with that dirty girl.

638
00:36:51.031 --> 00:36:54.990
It seems like a disinfectant,
you know,
like you're just getting blasted by

639
00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:59.770
<v 2>so it will kill any kind of fucking nasty little light bulbs are going to kill</v>

640
00:36:59.771 --> 00:37:03.190
the fucking funk.
They can live in.
Some chicks gave her that I've ever done.

641
00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:06.280
My wife,
my wife used to work at one.

642
00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:10.180
He's pretending these getting zapped this for a moment.

643
00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:14.680
This is a grown man grown man lying after his fuck.

644
00:37:14.681 --> 00:37:16.900
Some dirty girls.
He's lying there with goggles on.

645
00:37:16.901 --> 00:37:21.550
Go a little kill it or kill it all cooks to cook

646
00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:22.660
<v 5>bare ass.</v>

647
00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:25.690
I keep the underwear on but I should go bare ass cause then it would give me

648
00:37:25.691 --> 00:37:27.900
like,
you probably got a nice table.
You get it from,

649
00:37:28.370 --> 00:37:30.580
maybe your Dick would get less sensitive and leathery.

650
00:37:32.190 --> 00:37:34.800
You dig a bit like an old lady that's pentanance and shit.

651
00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:38.560
Do you get to as a young girl,
do you get the spots in your back?

652
00:37:38.650 --> 00:37:42.100
Some people like I've noticed when they tan they get like their shoulder blades

653
00:37:42.101 --> 00:37:46.750
create spot.
Yeah.
No,
not weird.
I love that show.
Their boobs and your butt cheeks.

654
00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:49.690
You Butt cheeks create them too.
I don't get that.

655
00:37:51.310 --> 00:37:52.990
When you said the sun doesn't go.

656
00:37:52.991 --> 00:37:55.990
I like to put the little stickers of the hearts and the really cheesy things on

657
00:37:55.991 --> 00:38:00.670
me when I,
when I tagged so that if,
uh,
you know,
I have my shirt off.

658
00:38:00.671 --> 00:38:02.500
It looks really,
really,
really homo

659
00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:07.530
<v 2>and the only people that see that girls,</v>

660
00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:10.040
<v 5>so it's really stupid for me to do was wrong thing.</v>

661
00:38:11.850 --> 00:38:14.970
Anytime you're fucking with your nipples,
just anything.
What are you doing?

662
00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:16.920
Any guy and doing things with their nipples.

663
00:38:16.921 --> 00:38:20.130
That's why when you see a guy with like nipple rings,
you're like,
oh,
okay,

664
00:38:20.131 --> 00:38:25.030
what else is going on?
What else is going well here?
Man?
Right belly button.
Is it,

665
00:38:25.031 --> 00:38:29.430
is it because of stuff like that feels good for them?
I don't know.

666
00:38:29.431 --> 00:38:33.330
It seems erotic or drawing attention.
There's the,
it's,
yeah,

667
00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:37.100
it's like they're making a statement.
There may,
it's more that than anything.

668
00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:40.480
I suppose.
Even if you were looking for a super sexual person,
when you're,

669
00:38:40.481 --> 00:38:43.600
you've got nick rings through your Nipples,
you know,

670
00:38:43.601 --> 00:38:46.300
you're kind of letting everybody know you're a freak,
right?

671
00:38:46.570 --> 00:38:48.940
Not there's anything wrong with it.
A lot of athletes do it.

672
00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.720
I've seen a lot of athletes that have nipple rings.
I don't know why.
You know,

673
00:38:52.770 --> 00:38:56.440
a few fighters of nipple rings.
I don't know why it's,

674
00:38:56.470 --> 00:38:59.230
it's part of their uniform at what's it's like sets them apart when they're on

675
00:38:59.231 --> 00:39:02.680
TV.
Especially the fighters because there shirtless,
right?
Well,
yeah,

676
00:39:02.681 --> 00:39:06.310
but they don't fight with nipple rings on and they're pussies.
Really.

677
00:39:06.370 --> 00:39:10.570
I'm just kidding.
Please.
You fight the warriors of old,

678
00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:12.940
how much piercing do you think they did back in the day?

679
00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:16.210
There's just say pirates had earrings,
right?
Right.

680
00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:18.850
Pearson has been going on forever.
Right.

681
00:39:19.210 --> 00:39:22.210
But has it been going on over the body like people do now?

682
00:39:22.290 --> 00:39:25.150
Like with Nipples and share thing?
Probably like there's African ears.

683
00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:28.330
Those boys were like,
oh yeah,
really nasty shit.

684
00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:32.590
Craziest thing is the fucking the mouth thing.
They do the,
the,

685
00:39:32.591 --> 00:39:37.120
I think it's Siri is a part of Africa.
I think that's where it is.
Where they,
uh,

686
00:39:37.121 --> 00:39:41.570
they stretched their lips out,
they stick a fucking odd,
uh,

687
00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:46.570
sharp sticks with their fucking lower lip and they slowly start to stretch it

688
00:39:46.571 --> 00:39:50.410
out.
It goes further and the more they stretch it out,

689
00:39:50.411 --> 00:39:54.670
the bigger the plate they can fit in their lip.
The more cattle they're worth.

690
00:39:54.671 --> 00:39:58.000
When would they get married off and that crazy.

691
00:39:58.030 --> 00:39:59.680
What about this next stretch of bitches?

692
00:39:59.970 --> 00:40:02.830
Oh that's not so if they take those off their debt.
Yeah.
Yeah.

693
00:40:03.070 --> 00:40:05.770
Because they can't support their neck.
They're not only that,

694
00:40:05.771 --> 00:40:07.840
their neck is like way longer than it's supposed to be,

695
00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:11.730
but it's the perfect blow job.
You basically have no neck muscle anymore.

696
00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:15.140
That's what that create.
Cause they,
I don't know what,

697
00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:20.400
who the fuck's idea was that
they didn't want the guys to come back down.

698
00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:22.440
You guys,
African women with the plates in their lip,

699
00:40:22.450 --> 00:40:26.410
they have to bang out their lower teeth.
Yeah.
At one point.
Yeah.
They've,
yeah,

700
00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:29.970
they've got to bang out their lower teeth and it just,
it just dangles.
Yeah.
Well,

701
00:40:29.971 --> 00:40:31.870
when you take the plate out,
it's disgusting.

702
00:40:32.110 --> 00:40:34.890
Have you heard about this new mouthwash,
speaking of teeth that,
uh,

703
00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:38.200
that they're testing at Ucla?
It's like a,
uh,
a bomb.

704
00:40:38.201 --> 00:40:41.370
Like you just do it once every four days and it just,
no cavities.

705
00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:46.240
So dead and Amir from that shit.
It's going to kill you too,

706
00:40:46.241 --> 00:40:47.550
man.
It's going to kill everything.

707
00:40:47.551 --> 00:40:51.970
I guess the whole thing is it kills the one virus that causes tooth decay and

708
00:40:51.971 --> 00:40:52.251
release.

709
00:40:52.251 --> 00:40:56.050
It just knocks it out so like you know that dentists are going to take over that

710
00:40:56.051 --> 00:40:57.730
and so you won't be able to buy it in the stores.

711
00:40:57.760 --> 00:40:59.950
You're going to tell you we're going to see not to brush for four days.

712
00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:03.550
You're going to find that you have to do anything except for Tartar.

713
00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:04.593
You know what?

714
00:41:04.620 --> 00:41:08.320
You're going to take it and you're going to feel like an ass to poison in your

715
00:41:08.321 --> 00:41:11.560
body.
It's a poison.
If it worked.
Yeah,

716
00:41:11.561 --> 00:41:14.860
but can it really can it really can.
It really just they can target.

717
00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:17.210
Just brush your teeth.
You Nasty Lady.
She said,

718
00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:20.500
I started using arm and hammer and it actually makes my teeth whiter.

719
00:41:20.501 --> 00:41:24.340
I haven't had like white teeth forever.
Really?
Armand Hammer works.

720
00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:27.060
What is like baking soda?
Yeah,
the baking soda stuff.
That works great.

721
00:41:27.490 --> 00:41:30.310
I used to brush my teeth with begging,
so Nikki Glaser told me too.

722
00:41:30.590 --> 00:41:34.250
It's crest plus.
My parents were hippies,
so we used to use baking soda

723
00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:36.320
<v 3>as toothpaste and I was a kid.</v>

724
00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:40.880
I don't want to get actual baking soda and it must work.
Yeah,
it does work.

725
00:41:41.110 --> 00:41:44.960
Yeah,
I,
it's something happened to me last week.

726
00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:47.480
You were mentioning the latches on the room on the door.

727
00:41:48.110 --> 00:41:52.910
I had a bathroom latch experience of somebody.
Oh No.
But I did it.

728
00:41:52.911 --> 00:41:56.360
I did a standup show last week at this Alexandria Hotel,
which is downtown.

729
00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:58.700
It's just you like,
it's now like a halfway house,

730
00:41:58.701 --> 00:42:00.980
but it used to be in the 20s like the best place.

731
00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:03.500
And I got there early and had to take a shit.

732
00:42:03.770 --> 00:42:06.350
So I'd go to the guy that books is shell.
This guy named Josh,

733
00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:07.520
no one really there yet.

734
00:42:07.790 --> 00:42:11.630
I found the guy's bathroom and there's only four standing urinals next to it.

735
00:42:11.631 --> 00:42:15.080
There was another room with no lock on the door that was just no toilet seat.

736
00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:16.630
So you just had to sit on the like a,

737
00:42:17.230 --> 00:42:20.540
it's a shy and so I went down to the bar and there was no lock on that bathroom

738
00:42:20.541 --> 00:42:23.580
door.
So you can be in their shitting and somebody just walk in.
So then the,

739
00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:24.830
the toilets on the other side of the room.

740
00:42:24.831 --> 00:42:26.510
So there's no like holding the door even.
It's just

741
00:42:26.590 --> 00:42:30.460
<v 2>like somebody walks in and,
sorry,
just sitting in the corner.</v>

742
00:42:30.910 --> 00:42:31.760
So I went up to the guy that

743
00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:33.920
<v 3>books to trial.
I said,
where do I,
and he goes,
oh,
you know what,</v>

744
00:42:33.921 --> 00:42:36.850
there's this girl's bathroom on this floor nobody knows,

745
00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:40.610
really knows about and nobody uses.
And so he goes bit in,

746
00:42:40.611 --> 00:42:43.220
it's totally empty right now and be fine.
So I go over there and sure enough,

747
00:42:43.221 --> 00:42:44.720
the bathrooms empty,
there's two stalls.

748
00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:48.110
So I go on this one and then as I'm finished,

749
00:42:48.410 --> 00:42:51.980
this girl comes in and sits in the stall next to me and I moved my feet over and

750
00:42:51.981 --> 00:42:56.920
she just starts farting and shitting.
Her brain's just like,
plop.

751
00:42:56.930 --> 00:42:59.300
And I'm just sitting there like,
oh my,
you know,

752
00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:03.530
trying to be as quiet as possible.
My,
I'm like beating up.
Um,

753
00:43:04.430 --> 00:43:05.750
and as she's almost finished,

754
00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:10.430
this other girl walks in and tries to go and now these doors fold in so they,

755
00:43:10.431 --> 00:43:12.740
it folds in the middle and the latches don't match up.

756
00:43:12.940 --> 00:43:16.470
So like over time they don't,
they don't,
so the door comes in,

757
00:43:16.471 --> 00:43:21.080
knows he can block it,
but it like caves in.
So she tries to go in,

758
00:43:21.081 --> 00:43:24.500
the girl's stall next to me first and the girls like,
um,
styles taken.

759
00:43:25.070 --> 00:43:26.620
But the stall next to me isn't,

760
00:43:26.820 --> 00:43:28.880
<v 2>ah,
and the girl</v>

761
00:43:30.910 --> 00:43:32.060
and she starts,

762
00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:36.860
I'm thinking I can get away with not making a noise,
just do it,
girl.

763
00:43:36.861 --> 00:43:39.980
I'm holding the door.
I was going to do girl voice as holding the doors.

764
00:43:40.590 --> 00:43:44.580
She keeps pushing like,
you know,
like just stop pushing if you feel resistance.

765
00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:47.460
She keeps pushing the advance.
He goes,
there's someone in there and I just go,

766
00:43:47.490 --> 00:43:49.950
yeah,
I'm in here.
Oh,

767
00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:55.230
wrapped up out of the bathroom.
The girl next to me wipes up leaves.

768
00:43:55.231 --> 00:43:58.500
And I'm sitting there like,
oh gosh,
dude,
there's only one way out.

769
00:43:58.501 --> 00:44:00.630
There's only one way I know that they're going to see me.

770
00:44:00.631 --> 00:44:02.010
So I wait a couple minutes,

771
00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:02.470
<v 3>it's and funny,</v>

772
00:44:02.470 --> 00:44:06.470
like get up and start to walk out and there's turn up girl across the room.

773
00:44:06.471 --> 00:44:10.610
I see her watching me walk out and I want just walk up to her and uh,

774
00:44:10.850 --> 00:44:15.800
and she goes,
you just heard me take a shit?
And I said,
yeah,
that was you.

775
00:44:15.830 --> 00:44:18.980
I,
um,
that was,
I'm so sorry about that.

776
00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:21.330
<v 2>As I'm talking to her,</v>

777
00:44:22.110 --> 00:44:24.720
the guy that books the show that told me to go in there and walks up and he
goes,

778
00:44:24.721 --> 00:44:25.740
hey,
have you met my girlfriend?

779
00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:31.980
And Ah,
and I probably know

780
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:33.660
<v 0>her better than he does is a sad thing.</v>

781
00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:39.690
But I like to think that maybe in some other world that after he told me to go

782
00:44:39.691 --> 00:44:42.170
to that bathroom,
he ran up to her and he's like,
Hey,
now's your chance.

783
00:44:42.190 --> 00:44:43.170
Get in there and take a shit.

784
00:44:46.830 --> 00:44:51.220
Did you imagine if they were freaks who that's what they were into their went to

785
00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:55.910
having other men listening could have been shit.
Ben,
do you think so?

786
00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:58.980
Is it possible?
What's the Po?
What is the potential?
Well,
you know,

787
00:44:59.110 --> 00:45:02.670
20% standup lies you people come up to you on the road that are freaks.

788
00:45:02.850 --> 00:45:04.680
It usually happens at least once a weekend for me.

789
00:45:04.910 --> 00:45:08.670
Like I met them at a comedy club were swingers.
Yeah.
Yeah.
We get that.

790
00:45:08.671 --> 00:45:09.271
Well comes in.
Well,

791
00:45:09.271 --> 00:45:12.810
they just hang out for a while and it's the point to where the show is over and

792
00:45:12.811 --> 00:45:15.240
you're just hanging out with the people,
your friends or whoever.

793
00:45:15.970 --> 00:45:19.950
You had the swingers happen a lot.
Yeah,
I've had that.
I think it was Tampa.

794
00:45:20.220 --> 00:45:24.630
I think there's a big swinger.
Yeah,
that sounds,
yeah,
it sounds like it.
Yeah.

795
00:45:24.631 --> 00:45:27.500
We did a show and then afterwards it's fucking,
people were telling us there,

796
00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:30.330
there were disgusting.
They would tell us their swingers.

797
00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:33.360
They could just come on down and you can just watch,
wait,
wait,
whoa,
whoa.

798
00:45:33.930 --> 00:45:37.500
Are you inviting me to watch you go?
Fuck.
Like really?

799
00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:41.760
Like I was going to go back to the hotel and watched some paper view.

800
00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.310
Maybe is a good mood.
That's a real person.

801
00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:47.830
Check my email once you can watch us.
Fuck.
You know,

802
00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:48.840
why don't we just facetime it?

803
00:45:50.910 --> 00:45:55.650
What you're entering into a world of uncertainty,
you know,

804
00:45:55.860 --> 00:45:58.780
I mean,
you could tell they were all cool.
We're all friends.

805
00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:00.490
It's very unsettling and it's,

806
00:46:00.491 --> 00:46:05.070
it's also weird when you look at them and you know that they're like,
you're,

807
00:46:05.071 --> 00:46:08.670
you're not leading your life quite right.
Yeah.
Something's going on.

808
00:46:08.860 --> 00:46:12.810
Something's not good with you guys.
We were in,
uh,
I forget what city it was.

809
00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:15.100
I shouldn't say anyway,
even if I knew,
uh,

810
00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:18.270
but me and Ari had this guy that was driving us around.

811
00:46:18.271 --> 00:46:21.330
It was a very conservative city,
I'll tell you that.
I won't say the city,

812
00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:25.250
but anyway,
this guy was driving us around and he was a real nice guy and,
uh,

813
00:46:25.290 --> 00:46:29.280
seemed like real proper,
you know,
kind of a southern dude.

814
00:46:29.730 --> 00:46:31.770
And then on the last day,

815
00:46:31.771 --> 00:46:36.771
he's driving us to the airport and he starts mentioning swinger clubs,

816
00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:41.730
the law out of nowhere.
He just got comfortable with us like the rest,

817
00:46:41.850 --> 00:46:44.490
the rest of the weekend he was,
yes sir.
Mr Rogan,
what'd you,
you know,

818
00:46:44.491 --> 00:46:48.750
what time is the show?
Mr Rogan.
Okay.
We'll meet you downstairs at seven 30.
Sharp.

819
00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:50.850
And he was super friendly and,
oh,
by the way,

820
00:46:50.851 --> 00:46:54.660
if you'd like to have sex with multiple people,
yeah.
Or my wife let me know,

821
00:46:54.990 --> 00:46:59.160
or my wife.
So,
um,
me and Ari get to the airport and he starts telling us,

822
00:46:59.161 --> 00:47:02.700
you know,
if you ever want to come by and you know,
and uh,
check it out,

823
00:47:02.730 --> 00:47:06.300
you just let me know and you know,
come by and check it out.
Like,

824
00:47:06.301 --> 00:47:10.350
what do you guys do?
You know?
He goes,
well,
we're swingers.
I go,
you're swingers.

825
00:47:10.351 --> 00:47:14.280
He goes,
yeah.
And I go,
wow.
So you let your,
your wife fucks other dude.
He goes,

826
00:47:14.281 --> 00:47:19.240
well,
I get to say,
uh,
you know,
if I don't like it,
I get to say no.

827
00:47:19.241 --> 00:47:23.190
If I don't like it,
you get to say no.
Obviously.
Like I was like,
what do you,

828
00:47:23.191 --> 00:47:25.820
when do you get to say no?
And he brought up some story about,

829
00:47:26.340 --> 00:47:30.220
the wife was looking at this big one.
This guy is a,
he's a big guy

830
00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:34.360
<v 1>and he was just too big and you know,
I know he's a black guy.
And he goes,
no,
no,</v>

831
00:47:34.361 --> 00:47:38.980
no,
no,
we don't do that.
We don't do that.
I go,

832
00:47:38.981 --> 00:47:43.480
so you don't have black guys fucker.
And he goes,
no,
no.
I would say no.
He goes,

833
00:47:43.481 --> 00:47:46.540
I just don't,
I don't want to have to measure up,
if you know what I mean.

834
00:47:48.190 --> 00:47:51.890
And he ends this weird attitude about it.
It was very strange.
You know,

835
00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:56.610
he just left.
He was in his fifties he was not a young guy.
Yeah,

836
00:47:56.620 --> 00:48:00.940
he was gray hair get to get to a place of,
you're just trying things out.

837
00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:03.460
Yeah,
I guess so maybe.

838
00:48:03.461 --> 00:48:06.440
Or maybe he's just fucked up and I,

839
00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:11.170
he seemed like a normal guy.
The real problem is you go to,

840
00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:14.620
to really get to know someone,
you have to have some conversations with them.

841
00:48:14.620 --> 00:48:17.800
It takes some time.
It's one of the cool things about doing a podcast.

842
00:48:17.801 --> 00:48:21.250
It's for two hours.
Yeah.
You get to talk,
you,
you get to know someone.

843
00:48:21.370 --> 00:48:24.310
It hits when you're just talking to a guy like,
hey,

844
00:48:24.311 --> 00:48:25.630
we'd like to go get something to eat.

845
00:48:25.631 --> 00:48:27.490
Where's the steakhouse getting drivers there?

846
00:48:27.610 --> 00:48:29.860
You don't get to know them that well.
Yeah.
Ask him a few questions.

847
00:48:29.861 --> 00:48:32.760
Grow up here yesterday.
I grew up in Buffalo.
You don't,

848
00:48:32.780 --> 00:48:33.880
you don't really know him that well.

849
00:48:33.910 --> 00:48:36.010
I know some people that just tell drivers like,
hey man,

850
00:48:36.011 --> 00:48:39.820
I just don't want to talk.
Really.
People do that.
Wow.

851
00:48:40.180 --> 00:48:44.140
I think that's rude.
It's so rude.
I,
um,
I always make them my friend.

852
00:48:44.170 --> 00:48:48.930
I'd take them to the shows.
I take them to the UFC.
I like it.
I get them tickets.

853
00:48:48.931 --> 00:48:52.530
I get them on,
not all of them.
Now we're going to drive her last week.
Yeah.
Well,

854
00:48:52.540 --> 00:48:56.800
every now and then there's some of them are not nice or,
or not into it.

855
00:48:56.850 --> 00:48:58.390
They just don't want,
you know,
it's not an older guy.

856
00:48:58.391 --> 00:49:01.060
He doesn't want to hang out with some fucking young idiots,
you know.

857
00:49:01.061 --> 00:49:03.970
But the last few guys,
we get them to the UFC,

858
00:49:03.971 --> 00:49:05.720
we get them to the comedy clubs and hanging out.

859
00:49:05.721 --> 00:49:09.380
We'll go to dinner with them by their dinner.
It's,
we'd make them like,

860
00:49:09.550 --> 00:49:11.290
so that they're just there,
the guy who was driving,

861
00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:14.860
but they get to have as much fun as we're having,
you know?
So it's,
it's for them.

862
00:49:14.861 --> 00:49:19.030
It's a great weekend.
You know,
anytime I am tip the shit out of him.
Yeah.
When,

863
00:49:19.050 --> 00:49:21.400
when they get to hang out too with like a celebrity,
you know,

864
00:49:21.401 --> 00:49:25.300
that that makes him excited sometimes.
I mean maybe they're the board of it,

865
00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:28.180
but I just want to make sure that while they're working it doesn't seem like

866
00:49:28.181 --> 00:49:31.810
work.
And I'm like,
you look the only,
you know,
just hang out with us man.

867
00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:34.930
We'll have some fun.
And some of them have been great.
You know the,
you know,

868
00:49:34.931 --> 00:49:37.430
the people that comedy clubs that pick you up or take you,

869
00:49:37.460 --> 00:49:38.860
sometimes they've got like a separate person.

870
00:49:38.861 --> 00:49:42.230
The person that drives you to rate it on
those,

871
00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:45.370
there's so many of those in my mind and sometimes I'll find me on Facebook and

872
00:49:45.371 --> 00:49:49.390
write to me and it's like,
well I don't,
what city was this cat?
Yeah,

873
00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:52.990
but half the time you have you ever think,
how do we know they're a good driver?

874
00:49:53.230 --> 00:49:56.660
There was one,
I remember,
man,
where the guy was a,

875
00:49:56.680 --> 00:50:01.510
it was in Florida and the guy was talking all this shit about all the other

876
00:50:01.511 --> 00:50:05.230
comedians that come there.
Oh yeah,
that's happened.
Why did they do that?

877
00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:08.260
So many guys do that.
This guy,
wow,
we thinks he can sell tickets.

878
00:50:08.261 --> 00:50:11.650
Couldn't even sell out.
Then tell how one champ gossipy,
and then this guy,

879
00:50:11.830 --> 00:50:13.780
you know,
you don't want,
I think what his problem is,

880
00:50:13.781 --> 00:50:16.780
he thinks she's a funnier comic than it really is.
And a lot of these guys,

881
00:50:16.781 --> 00:50:18.340
they don't want to do radio.
I got him up,

882
00:50:18.370 --> 00:50:21.370
I get him up at six o'clock and he's like,
going through this.
I'm like,
dude,

883
00:50:21.371 --> 00:50:24.970
what are you going to say about me?
Yeah,
this is gross.

884
00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:28.100
I have one college that books a lot of people that I know and

885
00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:32.060
<v 3>I had a terrible thing happen there and it's every time told to every comedian.</v>

886
00:50:32.140 --> 00:50:36.800
And so it was,
it was in a theater,

887
00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:40.690
it was in a theater.
And the,
uh,
this one I'm not actually sad,
scared about,

888
00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:44.750
but the a is a packed theater and there's a one seat open in the front row and

889
00:50:44.751 --> 00:50:49.070
this kid walks in and if this is 10 minutes into the show and it's a good show

890
00:50:49.071 --> 00:50:49.850
so far,

891
00:50:49.850 --> 00:50:54.260
this kid walks in wearing a maroon shirt with a silver tie wrap around Oakleys

892
00:50:55.310 --> 00:50:56.270
and black pants.

893
00:50:56.271 --> 00:51:00.200
He looks like he works at like hate or something and he's holding a six foot

894
00:51:00.201 --> 00:51:03.980
both staff and fingerless gloves with the,
with the Oakleys,

895
00:51:04.130 --> 00:51:05.630
he walks right up to the front row,

896
00:51:05.810 --> 00:51:09.530
walks right down the middle and sits down in the seat like nothing's out of

897
00:51:09.531 --> 00:51:13.130
place with a big staff,
a both staff,
a six foot both staff.

898
00:51:13.130 --> 00:51:16.670
And I know that because I later was asking what like a crossbow that you like

899
00:51:17.090 --> 00:51:20.510
took on being a thing happen.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.

900
00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:25.580
So the fuck,
I look at the guy and I go,
are you from the future?
Like,

901
00:51:25.581 --> 00:51:29.570
I didn't know what I started getting good response out of it and then I couldn't

902
00:51:29.571 --> 00:51:32.450
let it go that he was wearing sunglasses because in my mind,

903
00:51:32.451 --> 00:51:36.170
he was a frat kid that was trying to be funny for everyone in that room and I

904
00:51:36.171 --> 00:51:38.870
was not going to let him be went on me.

905
00:51:39.020 --> 00:51:42.830
And so eventually I got started getting more angry about it and it was like,

906
00:51:42.831 --> 00:51:46.010
take your sunglasses off.
Like just,
I know you've already disrupted the show.

907
00:51:46.011 --> 00:51:48.710
You walked down,
just take off your,
and you just wouldn't,
he wouldn't,

908
00:51:48.711 --> 00:51:52.220
he was such a smart ass.
I thought,
oh no.

909
00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:55.580
So I did.
He did talk a little bit now he wasn't blind.

910
00:51:55.581 --> 00:51:57.350
Like I found those things out.
Um,

911
00:51:57.530 --> 00:52:00.440
so at one point it got so bad that I couldn't stop talking about people were

912
00:52:00.441 --> 00:52:02.300
walking out and this girl in the front row,

913
00:52:02.570 --> 00:52:06.560
at one point I was just like sitting on the stool just like angry.
And she goes,

914
00:52:06.770 --> 00:52:11.690
can you just start telling jokes again?
Oh.
And I looked at it and I said,

915
00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:15.140
you're right.
I won't bring it up again.
I'm sorry.
It's very,
very unprofessional.

916
00:52:15.141 --> 00:52:18.680
Finished the show out without mentioning it.
And I did.
Walked offstage,

917
00:52:19.070 --> 00:52:21.890
was angry about it and I just kept saying like,
who does that?

918
00:52:21.891 --> 00:52:26.480
Who walks in front row?
You know,
she,
this lady comes back and she goes,

919
00:52:26.620 --> 00:52:30.410
oh that boy is a boy around campus that everybody knows.

920
00:52:30.411 --> 00:52:32.030
He dresses like that every day.

921
00:52:32.031 --> 00:52:35.630
There's also a boy here that dress like a pirate and they're special.

922
00:52:37.130 --> 00:52:39.650
And I was like,
oh,
okay.

923
00:52:39.651 --> 00:52:44.060
So from now on if a comedian comes or any a band or anybody that doesn't go
here,

924
00:52:44.360 --> 00:52:46.370
that might be talking to a group of people to say,
Hey,

925
00:52:46.371 --> 00:52:51.371
at some point a guy with sunglasses and a bow staff is going to walk in.

926
00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:55.880
Just ignore him.
He's special.
Just say that to people from now on.

927
00:52:55.881 --> 00:52:59.420
So that way they,
cause every comedian will comment on that.
I mean,

928
00:52:59.421 --> 00:53:02.270
how do you not comment on a pirate guy or a bow staff guy?

929
00:53:02.540 --> 00:53:05.270
Was he saying anything to you?

930
00:53:05.271 --> 00:53:09.290
Was he heckling or he wasn't giving me response is just kind of snobby.

931
00:53:09.770 --> 00:53:12.740
He didn't seem like he was that.
I just seem like he's just a special kid.

932
00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:17.570
Like he just is a bit off.
Right.
So you thought they just being cocky?
Yeah,

933
00:53:17.571 --> 00:53:20.990
I thought it was like a kid that was just trying to fuck with me.
Oh Wow.

934
00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:25.590
I totally misread it and let it get to my pride,
you know?

935
00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:30.570
<v 0>But every comedian people all the time or just like,
Hey,
I played this place.</v>

936
00:53:30.571 --> 00:53:33.570
And they said,
uh,
he told us the whole story and they said don't do that.

937
00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:39.210
Wow.
Yeah.
So you're the example.
Yeah,
it was a college.

938
00:53:39.211 --> 00:53:40.230
It's not like I was going to go back.

939
00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:47.280
Do you like doing colleges?
They're fun sometimes.
I just,
I do.
Um,

940
00:53:47.310 --> 00:53:51.030
I've been doing this comedy Central College tour this summer.
Well,
headline,

941
00:53:51.031 --> 00:53:52.650
like a couple of college shows every couple of weeks.

942
00:53:52.651 --> 00:53:57.651
And do you find it like it's almost like you have to explain things more or I

943
00:53:58.171 --> 00:54:01.560
don't change a thing and I'm not saying that in like a way of saying that.

944
00:54:01.561 --> 00:54:03.730
I'm curious.
I don't yet,

945
00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:07.850
but I just go up and do like I would at a comedy club and some things they get,

946
00:54:07.870 --> 00:54:10.560
some things they don't get the,
the things that they don't get.

947
00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:13.260
There's a couple of kids that get it and they like it even more,
you know?

948
00:54:13.740 --> 00:54:16.000
But you know,
I have jokes fall flat here and there.
It's,

949
00:54:16.090 --> 00:54:19.110
you never know which one and where,
you know,

950
00:54:19.140 --> 00:54:22.470
their life experience is so limited.
Sometimes you tell a joke,
you're like,

951
00:54:22.500 --> 00:54:24.810
oh yeah,
that's because you don't,
yeah,

952
00:54:24.870 --> 00:54:29.870
I remember I was in the University of Miami and I was talking about something

953
00:54:30.090 --> 00:54:33.240
sexual and then I paused and I said,

954
00:54:33.930 --> 00:54:35.580
are any of you guys virgins?

955
00:54:36.870 --> 00:54:41.470
And a bunch of people put their hands up like way more than I would've expected.

956
00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:45.360
Was it,
was it a religious school?
No,
I don't think so.

957
00:54:45.361 --> 00:54:50.250
It was just a regular college.
It was like,
wow.
So there's,
you know,

958
00:54:50.251 --> 00:54:54.180
18 year olds are say they didn't know what I was talking about.

959
00:54:54.390 --> 00:54:56.510
They were just baffled.
They look shocked.

960
00:54:56.520 --> 00:54:59.250
Literally I was assaulting them with information that they didn't really need.

961
00:54:59.340 --> 00:55:00.173
Well,
you're also,

962
00:55:00.180 --> 00:55:03.120
you're also playing some sort of a corporate party because it's a,

963
00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:05.100
it's almost like you were playing for a whole company.

964
00:55:05.110 --> 00:55:06.450
People that see each other every day,

965
00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:09.240
they're not going to laugh at some things in front of those people.

966
00:55:09.950 --> 00:55:11.270
They don't like,
uh,

967
00:55:11.430 --> 00:55:14.220
they don't want the person that they sit next to you to know that they like anal

968
00:55:14.221 --> 00:55:18.630
sex jokes.
Yeah.
Colleges are so strange when you really think about it.

969
00:55:18.631 --> 00:55:22.140
So there is there a little prude bunch of people have paid money to send their

970
00:55:22.141 --> 00:55:25.350
kids to school and I'm certain percentage of that goes to entertainment and they

971
00:55:25.380 --> 00:55:28.440
pay exorbitant amounts of money.
Great money.
Yeah.
For,

972
00:55:28.500 --> 00:55:31.770
well I'll show you can get paid.
So you get paid great.
Great money.
I don't,

973
00:55:31.771 --> 00:55:32.371
I haven't done them.

974
00:55:32.371 --> 00:55:35.520
I haven't done them in a long time because at some point people are making like,

975
00:55:35.630 --> 00:55:39.360
I mean a hundred grand just for a show.
Yeah.

976
00:55:39.361 --> 00:55:42.240
I don't know if that's going on anymore with the economy the way it is.

977
00:55:42.970 --> 00:55:44.200
I don't know why it wouldn't,
oh,
trust.

978
00:55:44.201 --> 00:55:47.160
Still the same amount of people are going to school right there and there's

979
00:55:47.161 --> 00:55:48.120
still that much budget.

980
00:55:50.140 --> 00:55:52.400
<v 5>I don't know if you want me to tell you what Brendan was.</v>

981
00:55:53.080 --> 00:55:57.430
<v 0>Yes.
No I don't.
I don't.
And now he's actually just getting interested in my head.</v>

982
00:55:57.800 --> 00:56:01.270
What did he say?
What does the mass head games,
it's pretty sad.

983
00:56:03.940 --> 00:56:07.870
<v 5>They should pay me for that.
Anyway,
I filled out paperwork.</v>

984
00:56:08.650 --> 00:56:10.750
Now you've got to think that he's not listening to this podcast right now,

985
00:56:10.751 --> 00:56:12.110
so he's probably like this part.

986
00:56:12.111 --> 00:56:14.800
You know the paperwork and everything and he goes,
good prank though.

987
00:56:15.280 --> 00:56:18.780
We'll give you $1,500 a shave your beard.
Psych

988
00:56:21.610 --> 00:56:25.910
1500 bucks.
Yeah,
bucks.
Yeah,
you can get the score.

989
00:56:25.911 --> 00:56:28.690
Didn't take money.
He went and take money.
Yes,
he would know.

990
00:56:29.050 --> 00:56:32.470
I know because I tried giving him,
I tried.
I felt so guilty afterwards.

991
00:56:32.530 --> 00:56:34.000
You tried giving them 1500 bucks?
No,

992
00:56:34.001 --> 00:56:39.001
I tried giving him 400 or 200 if you've got them a check from NBC for 1500 bucks

993
00:56:39.940 --> 00:56:42.610
or whatever TVs for 1500 bucks.

994
00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:46.900
I just turned down money the other day.
Joe And I turned down,

995
00:56:47.290 --> 00:56:51.320
I think you'd agree with,
I think Britain washes when it told me not to do it.
Uh,

996
00:56:51.410 --> 00:56:55.600
I was going to do an abduction video with Veronica and uh,

997
00:56:55.720 --> 00:56:59.080
they were gonna pay us money to be like a boyfriend and girlfriend and then they

998
00:56:59.081 --> 00:57:02.530
were going to duct us and tie us up and they weren't,

999
00:57:02.531 --> 00:57:05.500
it was only me and her in the whole entire video and it was just us like

1000
00:57:05.501 --> 00:57:09.490
struggling and in like,
uh,
like they would like focus on my girls but you know,

1001
00:57:09.491 --> 00:57:12.640
while she's tied up or something and no nudity for me,

1002
00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:16.000
but they were going to pay me $400 to do,

1003
00:57:16.001 --> 00:57:20.280
they were going to pay you and make you feel like,

1004
00:57:20.390 --> 00:57:21.970
I think it would be,
I know they see,

1005
00:57:21.971 --> 00:57:25.510
I don't like being tied up and I hope first of all is this a porn company that

1006
00:57:25.511 --> 00:57:27.730
was doing this fetish company is that they don't get,

1007
00:57:27.790 --> 00:57:30.160
they don't do porn but it's like they were going to kill you.

1008
00:57:30.220 --> 00:57:34.120
Now you're about to be a snob samples and it would be like this guy and the girl

1009
00:57:34.510 --> 00:57:37.030
tied up in the backseat of a car and they're just like,
oh,

1010
00:57:37.031 --> 00:57:41.190
help me get out of here man.
Hell,
I can't get up beat off to them.

1011
00:57:41.650 --> 00:57:44.200
And then is that when no,
nothing.

1012
00:57:44.201 --> 00:57:48.490
It's just me being tied up and trying to get free and they just be naked with

1013
00:57:48.491 --> 00:57:50.970
clothes on and I thought I could make it our funnel.
I like,

1014
00:57:50.980 --> 00:57:54.730
it would be funny if you are watching those ones,

1015
00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:57.870
which is a great democratic fuck your girl while you're tied up to,

1016
00:57:57.871 --> 00:58:00.880
that's what the real deal and then we're going to go look,
she's a porn star.

1017
00:58:00.881 --> 00:58:04.480
You signed up for this.
That's what you signed up for.
It's so weird.

1018
00:58:04.510 --> 00:58:08.340
There's people like that shit though.
People were getting tied up.
Yeah.

1019
00:58:08.870 --> 00:58:10.400
If someone started screaming,
no,

1020
00:58:10.420 --> 00:58:13.240
you would just have to accept the fact you're in this porn.

1021
00:58:13.330 --> 00:58:15.490
What's like the like the clothes,

1022
00:58:15.580 --> 00:58:19.510
the clothes lines like pinching the skin around the rope.
Have you seen that?

1023
00:58:20.010 --> 00:58:23.440
Really?
People like that are just tied up by a ton of rope.

1024
00:58:23.441 --> 00:58:26.800
Not just like hands tied,
like their body is like,
oh right,
yeah,

1025
00:58:26.801 --> 00:58:27.730
I've seen this really,

1026
00:58:27.731 --> 00:58:31.370
really intensely tied and there's like clothing pins around them.

1027
00:58:31.730 --> 00:58:36.450
It's very scary looking at what the fuck man,
how did you get there?

1028
00:58:37.020 --> 00:58:39.700
And then they have these rope marks that are just ridiculous and how much are

1029
00:58:39.701 --> 00:58:44.100
they going to pay you to tell you about $400
she was getting honored.

1030
00:58:45.210 --> 00:58:47.130
I don't get as much as her as your Adrian,

1031
00:58:47.410 --> 00:58:50.020
I'm going to have to ask for more money.
So how long,

1032
00:58:50.021 --> 00:58:53.230
how long had you been together?
They have a lot of internet credibility,
Bro.

1033
00:58:53.231 --> 00:58:56.890
Don't sell yourself for 400 bucks.
Somebody video comes out,
you know,

1034
00:58:56.891 --> 00:58:59.230
red band and his girlfriend get tied up.

1035
00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:02.860
Do you know when people want to tie you up and fucked here was my excuse because

1036
00:59:02.870 --> 00:59:06.730
the shoot,
because she can't take a job Ryan.
It comes like,
no you should.
It's,

1037
00:59:06.900 --> 00:59:09.220
he can make it a she said you'd be doing it.
No,
no.
She was like,

1038
00:59:09.280 --> 00:59:11.590
she didn't tell me but she's like,
you could make it like a joke.

1039
00:59:11.591 --> 00:59:15.340
It could be funny.
So your fans and everybody will think it's funny.
And I'm like,

1040
00:59:15.341 --> 00:59:17.700
yeah,
but you know what self,

1041
00:59:18.340 --> 00:59:22.280
I'm sure I would do a better job and I would make it even better.
You know,
like,

1042
00:59:22.370 --> 00:59:25.940
<v 2>yeah,
I can make my own fitness.
It's going to be a guy there to just,
no,</v>

1043
00:59:25.941 --> 00:59:30.380
it's just me and you probably know better people is the camera man isn't talking

1044
00:59:30.381 --> 00:59:33.110
shit to you.
No,
no,
no,
no.
It's just like,
he goes,
all right,

1045
00:59:33.111 --> 00:59:36.580
now you're going to be in the car struggling to get her in the car struggling.

1046
00:59:36.680 --> 00:59:39.380
And then all of a sudden I got to go get the fuck down.

1047
00:59:39.710 --> 00:59:42.170
W W we're just filming something.
Shut the fuck up.

1048
00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:45.170
The guy puts a gun in your face and you don't even realize that that's the real

1049
00:59:45.171 --> 00:59:49.860
script.
The real script is that they want to do.
Uh,
and then he just raped.
Wait,

1050
00:59:50.560 --> 00:59:52.150
a porno sits there waiting.

1051
00:59:52.690 --> 00:59:57.170
Want to see what a fetishes like mother fuckers crazy fuck you.

1052
00:59:57.171 --> 00:59:59.470
And I think some church,
it's like a Dexter here.

1053
00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:01.940
What happens is they get you tied up and then they just robbed you.

1054
01:00:01.940 --> 01:00:04.390
And they were like,
you idiot,
we were going to pay you 400 bucks.
Yeah.

1055
01:00:04.610 --> 01:00:07.880
Anybody who's willing to lock your now doing that for 400 bucks isn't going to

1056
01:00:07.881 --> 01:00:12.200
have a lot of money on them.
I think that'd be worth.
Robbins was a legit company,

1057
01:00:12.230 --> 01:00:13.630
but then they use a legit,

1058
01:00:13.990 --> 01:00:17.390
they have like a full website and they sent me all the samples and everything.

1059
01:00:17.391 --> 01:00:21.140
We're about to be in a snuff film,
some of the cloud.
We've set it up,
they look,

1060
01:00:21.141 --> 01:00:23.120
we can get them,
we can get it for 400 bucks and then we're going to,

1061
01:00:23.420 --> 01:00:25.640
if we really want to get them to spending a lot of money,
let's,

1062
01:00:25.641 --> 01:00:28.100
let's offer him $1,000.
Now he's going to know it's bullshit.

1063
01:00:28.101 --> 01:00:31.010
Why would we give him $1,000?
His girlfriend is in the business.
Listen,

1064
01:00:31.310 --> 01:00:34.250
the kid will do it for 400 bucks,
400 bucks,
and then we kill him.

1065
01:00:34.340 --> 01:00:38.800
They said I could wear a mask if I wanted it to.
One of those,
um,
those uh,

1066
01:00:39.230 --> 01:00:41.020
Guy Fawkes mask.
Oh Gosh,

1067
01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:45.050
I would probably want to wear a bank robber ski masks.

1068
01:00:45.051 --> 01:00:47.090
Things with the eyes cut out.
I think that would look pretty cool.
It'd be like,

1069
01:00:47.091 --> 01:00:51.230
Hey,
I'm a halflife guy tied up masks.
Oh,

1070
01:00:51.231 --> 01:00:53.780
that would even be better.
That's what I was saying.
That's the guy fall.

1071
01:00:53.781 --> 01:00:56.180
I think that's his name guy fault,
isn't it?
Then that's it.

1072
01:00:56.270 --> 01:00:58.970
He imagined being the guy that designed that mask and be like,
Hey,

1073
01:00:58.971 --> 01:01:03.710
I thought it was just for this movie and what the,
I think it's about that guy.

1074
01:01:03.711 --> 01:01:04.830
It's no,

1075
01:01:04.930 --> 01:01:09.930
the real mask is a about the original design I believe is that guy that tried to

1076
01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:15.320
blow up something in England.
They have guy Fawkes day.

1077
01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:19.250
Oh from Ocean's 11 well no,
he's from real life.

1078
01:01:21.530 --> 01:01:25.130
Another French guy for oceans death squad though.
I have that mask in my window.

1079
01:01:25.410 --> 01:01:30.020
Got As long.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's a,
that's the mass.
That guy,

1080
01:01:30.050 --> 01:01:33.440
the guy looked like that.
That was like,
what is a,

1081
01:01:35.060 --> 01:01:39.080
this is what it looked like.
So that's from the movie though?
Yeah,
it is.

1082
01:01:39.081 --> 01:01:40.820
But it's based on this guy bro.

1083
01:01:41.270 --> 01:01:43.920
It's based on this guy whose actual design of that mask.

1084
01:01:43.921 --> 01:01:46.250
I'm saying that the guy that designed that math for the movie,

1085
01:01:46.251 --> 01:01:50.540
he probably thought,
you know,
he's just a,
well,
the reason why anonymous takes it,

1086
01:01:50.541 --> 01:01:55.130
and the reason why I was in that movie vi is that this mask of this guy,

1087
01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:59.940
this guy stood for,
I mean,
they,
they celebrate him like they celebrate,
um,

1088
01:02:00.020 --> 01:02:01.910
right.
Independence Day over here.
When we were there,

1089
01:02:02.030 --> 01:02:03.560
they were blowing off fireworks and shit.

1090
01:02:03.561 --> 01:02:06.400
We were in England for Guy Fawkes Day and uh,

1091
01:02:06.410 --> 01:02:09.350
they had fireworks going off and they all wear that mask.
No,

1092
01:02:09.351 --> 01:02:13.430
but the driver was explaining to me what it was all about and that,
and I go,

1093
01:02:13.431 --> 01:02:16.220
so basically he was a terrorist.
The guy tried to,
you know,

1094
01:02:16.250 --> 01:02:19.920
blow up whatever they had was a parliament or whatever,
whenever they call it.

1095
01:02:20.270 --> 01:02:23.420
<v 1>Let me see.
When he tried to blow up,
well,
whatever he tried to do,
he,</v>

1096
01:02:23.421 --> 01:02:27.510
he planned to assassinate King James.
And um,
he was,
uh,

1097
01:02:27.570 --> 01:02:28.740
he was,
uh,

1098
01:02:28.770 --> 01:02:31.410
going there to blow things up when they killed him and they executed them.

1099
01:02:31.860 --> 01:02:35.610
But because that this guy,
because he was making that effort,

1100
01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:39.780
became this hero and became this representation of we're not going to take your

1101
01:02:39.781 --> 01:02:43.290
bullshit.
And so that's why in v they use that,

1102
01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:46.320
what does a vendetta fee favor the use that mask.

1103
01:02:46.321 --> 01:02:50.070
And that's why that mask has been adopted by the anonymous movement.

1104
01:02:50.130 --> 01:02:54.330
It's like the same spirit behind that guys,
what they live by.

1105
01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:56.010
Is that one guy still involved in the,

1106
01:02:56.100 --> 01:02:59.790
the guy that Lucas or what was his name?

1107
01:02:59.791 --> 01:03:04.230
That guy that was the main Lauren who talking about Ellucian.

1108
01:03:05.070 --> 01:03:05.530
The Guy,

1109
01:03:05.530 --> 01:03:08.760
the main guy from anonymous that was getting you talking about the Wiki leaks.

1110
01:03:10.130 --> 01:03:10.741
Love God.

1111
01:03:10.741 --> 01:03:14.280
I just crossed wikileaks with anonymous Julian Assan she's talking about,
yeah,

1112
01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:16.980
he's um,
I think he's still getting fucked,
man.

1113
01:03:16.981 --> 01:03:20.670
I think that guy still has to go to the police and check in every day has got

1114
01:03:20.671 --> 01:03:24.960
like some crazy house arrest thing that he's under for sexual misconduct and

1115
01:03:24.961 --> 01:03:27.960
another country.
And you know what the charges,
it's like some,

1116
01:03:27.990 --> 01:03:31.010
some derivative of rape.
And essentially what happened was this,

1117
01:03:31.090 --> 01:03:34.470
he was fucking this check.
They were sleeping together.
And,
uh,

1118
01:03:34.471 --> 01:03:37.740
while they were sleeping,
he stuck in inside of her,
you know,

1119
01:03:37.741 --> 01:03:41.640
and he didn't have a condom on.
And that's like,
uh,
some sort of a rape situation.

1120
01:03:42.030 --> 01:03:46.500
Like,
first of all,
that's stupid.
Well,
that's,
you know what,
the sleepwalking man?

1121
01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:47.890
No,
it was,
it,
he,

1122
01:03:47.970 --> 01:03:52.650
you can't rub vaginas and penises together in the middle of the night naked and

1123
01:03:52.651 --> 01:03:56.010
not,
and not assume that one's going to go flying in there.
You know,

1124
01:03:56.011 --> 01:03:59.490
you have to put fucking panties.
But he did it on purpose though,
right?

1125
01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:02.670
I don't know.
I don't know.
Who knows?
You know,
it could be,
yes,

1126
01:04:02.671 --> 01:04:06.930
it could be that they paid the check to,
to make a big deal out of this,
to,

1127
01:04:07.050 --> 01:04:10.050
to embarrass him into a discredit wikileaks,

1128
01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:12.990
because it does to a certain extent when they're interviewing or like,
is there,

1129
01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:16.500
are you sure you don't remember anything odd?
Oh,
well,
one night,

1130
01:04:16.890 --> 01:04:20.250
you know what man,
what a person does sexually.
I mean,

1131
01:04:20.251 --> 01:04:23.370
that doesn't seem like rape to me.
That seems like he's kind of a weaselly dude.

1132
01:04:23.550 --> 01:04:26.230
But I kind of figured he was a weasley dude anyway.
You know what I mean?

1133
01:04:26.231 --> 01:04:29.820
You ever watch them dance?
There's videos of Julian Assange dancing,
you know,

1134
01:04:29.821 --> 01:04:34.821
and he's most certainly like housewives cult cult of personality thing going on.

1135
01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:39.750
You know,
he mo mostly looking guy though most certainly enjoys it,

1136
01:04:39.751 --> 01:04:42.720
but he's also doing some really brave shit,
you know,

1137
01:04:42.721 --> 01:04:47.290
and we expect our heroes to be 100% perfect and that is fucking ridiculous.

1138
01:04:47.310 --> 01:04:50.850
They're going to do a movie about it.
I'm sure they will hear that.
They will.

1139
01:04:51.150 --> 01:04:54.630
He's so fucking brilliant guy.
I mean what he did was pretty amazing then.

1140
01:04:54.810 --> 01:04:56.040
You know,
love it or hate it.

1141
01:04:56.041 --> 01:04:59.970
He got some information loose that opened a lot of people's eyes to how things

1142
01:04:59.971 --> 01:05:04.850
go on and you know,
that's,
that's a,
that's a powerful thing.
I mean and,

1143
01:05:04.860 --> 01:05:06.480
and when,
when it comes to history,
you know,

1144
01:05:06.481 --> 01:05:10.380
when it comes to the history of intelligence and you know,
in,
in,
in,

1145
01:05:10.381 --> 01:05:13.950
in distributing information through a digital form,
like,
you know,

1146
01:05:13.951 --> 01:05:17.890
like being able to burn things on CD and burn information on Usbs,

1147
01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:20.280
that shit will never happen again.
Like what?
What?

1148
01:05:20.281 --> 01:05:22.980
What happened with this one soldier when he was able to do they,

1149
01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:25.300
they're going to make sure that fucking never happens again.

1150
01:05:25.301 --> 01:05:29.590
All because of this one.
Got It.
Probably historically,

1151
01:05:29.591 --> 01:05:33.850
but historically [inaudible] super important and they still got him fucked on

1152
01:05:33.851 --> 01:05:35.680
this one weird sex charge,
man.

1153
01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:38.650
When you think about all the fucking things that you,

1154
01:05:38.651 --> 01:05:42.520
somehow bankers have done all the fucking things that politicians have done,

1155
01:05:42.700 --> 01:05:45.880
this congress thing that they had on 60 minutes where they show the insider

1156
01:05:45.881 --> 01:05:47.530
trading that Congress is guilty up.

1157
01:05:47.710 --> 01:05:52.330
Congress are exempt from insider trading laws so they can just insider trade all

1158
01:05:52.330 --> 01:05:53.260
day long.
They get information,

1159
01:05:53.261 --> 01:05:56.290
they sell and buy stock based on it and they don't even go to jail for it.

1160
01:05:57.280 --> 01:06:00.940
It's fucking madness.
That's still happening right now.

1161
01:06:01.350 --> 01:06:04.990
It's still happening right now.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1162
01:06:04.991 --> 01:06:08.500
It's depressing as fuck man.
This,
this is why anonymous,

1163
01:06:08.501 --> 01:06:10.390
this is Guy Fawkes it's all the same shit.

1164
01:06:10.540 --> 01:06:15.130
It's the shame shit has been going on forever and 1570 this Guy Fox existed.

1165
01:06:15.340 --> 01:06:19.480
You know,
think about that.
1570s it was the same bullshit,

1166
01:06:19.690 --> 01:06:23.050
same bullshit.
The assholes on top trying to keep the man down.

1167
01:06:23.051 --> 01:06:26.410
Everybody's crazy and the pissed off.
They want to blow things up.

1168
01:06:26.860 --> 01:06:31.690
I mean this is the same thing in 2011 the only difference is now people are just

1169
01:06:31.750 --> 01:06:34.770
sleeping in tents in front of building.
Short of,
I think it's,

1170
01:06:34.890 --> 01:06:39.580
it's just beginning.
I really do.
I think this is what we have here,
man,

1171
01:06:39.581 --> 01:06:44.581
is the system that existed in its corrupt form only because the Internet didn't

1172
01:06:44.801 --> 01:06:49.420
exist,
but now that the Internet exists,
I don't think it can exist anymore.

1173
01:06:49.450 --> 01:06:52.870
It'll be interested to see what if that girl that if that girl really lost a

1174
01:06:52.871 --> 01:06:55.670
baby in Seattle and did you read that story?
Yeah,
she did.
Yeah.

1175
01:06:56.260 --> 01:07:00.520
I didn't know if they confirmed with the hospital if that was the reason yet or

1176
01:07:00.521 --> 01:07:03.740
not or if they'd had an app that you can actually pinpoint a reason why some of

1177
01:07:03.750 --> 01:07:04.583
us carry that.

1178
01:07:04.840 --> 01:07:07.630
Maybe they haven't actually confirmed it with the hospital last time I read it.

1179
01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:09.970
I don't know if they had,
I mean look at Olin makes sense.

1180
01:07:10.030 --> 01:07:12.430
She's horribly traumatic situation.

1181
01:07:12.431 --> 01:07:16.450
The shakuhachi horrendous when that story is out on the way out and would be

1182
01:07:16.451 --> 01:07:19.600
interested to see what happens.
I've seen people tear gas,
man,
it's brutal.

1183
01:07:19.750 --> 01:07:24.400
Pepper sprays,
even worse.
Pepper sprays up burns,
man,
it's horrendous.

1184
01:07:24.401 --> 01:07:27.430
I've seen people get hit with it.
If photoshops are so amazing now,

1185
01:07:27.431 --> 01:07:30.910
if I were that guy spraying where that people are putting it in like different

1186
01:07:30.911 --> 01:07:34.120
pieces like spark,
like,
oh what an asshole.

1187
01:07:34.121 --> 01:07:36.370
That guy and you know they got that guy's email address.

1188
01:07:36.371 --> 01:07:38.950
They've got that guy's phone number.
They put it all online.

1189
01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:44.270
That guy's going to get a lashing from the Internet.
You know?

1190
01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:47.860
It's like the only reason why that guy thought that he could do that.

1191
01:07:47.890 --> 01:07:52.300
What the fuck would an officer of the police,

1192
01:07:52.301 --> 01:07:57.190
why the fuck would an officer or the police think that he could be spraying

1193
01:07:57.191 --> 01:08:02.191
pepper spray and the lace is a face full protestors and that that would be a

1194
01:08:02.501 --> 01:08:06.440
part of his job.
That was the one from the college right?
From,
yeah,

1195
01:08:06.550 --> 01:08:09.740
UC Berkeley or UC Davis,
right?
Was it UC Davis?

1196
01:08:10.180 --> 01:08:12.180
What the fuck is that man?
Get what?

1197
01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:17.240
What kind of a human being could spray a terrifying thing like pepper gas that

1198
01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:21.980
that pepper spray fucking hurts in a little girl's face.

1199
01:08:22.250 --> 01:08:24.890
I'm looking at this girl,
she's like 18 years old,
17 years old,

1200
01:08:24.891 --> 01:08:27.760
whatever the fuck they are our first year of college and he's blasting them when

1201
01:08:27.761 --> 01:08:31.490
they're idealistic face with pepper spray sprayed that are sitting there at a

1202
01:08:31.491 --> 01:08:34.850
dance in junior high at my school into the ventilation system and I just had a

1203
01:08:34.851 --> 01:08:35.760
little bit of it and,

1204
01:08:35.820 --> 01:08:39.240
and had to go out in the air ambulance to the thought of having,
you know,

1205
01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:42.920
a full thing sprayed in your face.
Point blank range,
you know,

1206
01:08:42.921 --> 01:08:46.850
and this is on top of all the videos of them jabbing kids with batons.

1207
01:08:47.180 --> 01:08:49.220
It's like you can't,
no one learns.

1208
01:08:49.221 --> 01:08:52.460
We don't learn anything from the 60s were doing the same fucking thing.

1209
01:08:52.700 --> 01:08:57.230
But it's just now we have too much information.
The,

1210
01:08:57.430 --> 01:09:00.320
the Internet,
this life that you and I are living,

1211
01:09:00.710 --> 01:09:04.610
we are the only people ever in the history of humanity that have had the

1212
01:09:04.611 --> 01:09:07.790
internet,
the people that like you and I who remember when it didn't exist.

1213
01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:09.210
And the people like,
you know,

1214
01:09:09.230 --> 01:09:12.830
really young people that were born with it and I've never,
never been without it.

1215
01:09:13.150 --> 01:09:17.450
The,
they,
we live in a different era.
This is a different time.

1216
01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:22.340
We know vastly more than we ever did when,
you know,

1217
01:09:22.370 --> 01:09:25.430
there was no internet when you had to rely on books and magazines and newspapers

1218
01:09:25.431 --> 01:09:27.680
and God forbid television news for your information.

1219
01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:29.780
Even know if I would have been able to get to your house,
never.

1220
01:09:29.810 --> 01:09:32.120
You would have had to get one of those Thomas Guides.
You remember those?

1221
01:09:32.121 --> 01:09:36.860
I had one welfare,
uh,
Tom Scott,
he dies.
He uses navigation now.

1222
01:09:36.861 --> 01:09:40.880
He gave,
he gave up eventually,
but that mother fucker was Thomas Guide forever.

1223
01:09:40.910 --> 01:09:44.840
Yeah.
Yeah.
She's in such a silly goose,
but you know,

1224
01:09:44.870 --> 01:09:48.650
this is the only time ever where anybody's had this kind of information in the

1225
01:09:48.651 --> 01:09:52.490
system that we have set up right now.
The government system,
our financial system,

1226
01:09:52.491 --> 01:09:56.270
all these systems were set up before the Internet.
All these systems were set up.

1227
01:09:56.420 --> 01:09:57.750
The system of law,
the,

1228
01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:02.120
all this stuff was before everybody could see the transparency of information

1229
01:10:02.121 --> 01:10:06.770
that we have today.
Yeah,
I think about when I,
what was your first time you went?

1230
01:10:06.771 --> 01:10:09.200
Do you remember the first time you went on the Internet?
Oh,
he's calling us.

1231
01:10:09.380 --> 01:10:13.520
Pick up the phone.
Wait.
Oh my speaker phone on speaker phone.
Tell Him

1232
01:10:15.470 --> 01:10:17.000
<v 4>Hey Brendan Walsh.
Hey Brennan.</v>

1233
01:10:18.190 --> 01:10:19.710
<v 6>Do you guys still do on your podcast?</v>

1234
01:10:19.890 --> 01:10:24.300
<v 4>You're on it right now.
Hey Man,</v>

1235
01:10:24.301 --> 01:10:28.110
we've got to use that video in the world that the world has.
Got to see you.

1236
01:10:28.111 --> 01:10:31.260
What that half a beard.
That Harry Potter outfit.

1237
01:10:32.690 --> 01:10:33.540
<v 6>Yeah,
that's fine.</v>

1238
01:10:34.050 --> 01:10:37.800
<v 4>You're a beautiful man.
Oh,
I know.</v>

1239
01:10:40.830 --> 01:10:41.910
It's a hilarious story.

1240
01:10:41.940 --> 01:10:44.490
Did I'm glad you want people to see it cause it's hilarious.

1241
01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:50.290
<v 6>Oh sorry about it.
Still.
I guess</v>

1242
01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:52.020
<v 4>he wants to call a truce.</v>

1243
01:10:52.110 --> 01:10:56.190
Nick Dude wants to call it to no more pranks.

1244
01:10:56.280 --> 01:10:59.970
Are you in the the trousseau no more pranks.

1245
01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:01.390
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1246
01:11:01.390 --> 01:11:03.460
<v 4>And he gives you $400.</v>

1247
01:11:04.270 --> 01:11:06.820
No more prints and he gives you $400.

1248
01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:08.233
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1249
01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:13.310
<v 6>Uh,
but I don't think that right.</v>

1250
01:11:13.380 --> 01:11:17.940
Cause what Nick's retaliation was for wise,

1251
01:11:18.710 --> 01:11:23.520
uh,
me tweeting to him.
Congratulations on getting Saturday night live.

1252
01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.190
We were all,
we're all in seeing the room when I,

1253
01:11:26.191 --> 01:11:28.650
me and Chelsea Peretti did it right in front of him.

1254
01:11:28.651 --> 01:11:31.060
He was on board with it and then when he got emails,

1255
01:11:35.290 --> 01:11:36.480
<v 2>what would it be?
Funny</v>

1256
01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:42.750
he knew he was going to do before he did it.

1257
01:11:43.730 --> 01:11:48.240
What I remember was it was more of a,
wouldn't it be funny if we did this?
Oh,

1258
01:11:48.241 --> 01:11:50.910
so it wasn't a surprise at all to you?

1259
01:11:51.450 --> 01:11:53.990
I didn't know that they were going to think,
wouldn't it be funny if we do this?

1260
01:11:54.210 --> 01:11:56.220
The way that it happened,
it didn't feel like,

1261
01:11:56.221 --> 01:11:58.170
I didn't think it was actually going to be tweeted,

1262
01:11:58.770 --> 01:12:00.600
or at least I didn't think that it was going to happen.

1263
01:12:01.670 --> 01:12:02.530
<v 6>You we did it.</v>

1264
01:12:02.750 --> 01:12:04.760
<v 2>No,
I knew you did.
I knew it.
You told him.
No,</v>

1265
01:12:04.761 --> 01:12:08.450
I didn't come as a surprise to me in the sense that I didn't like just get,

1266
01:12:08.451 --> 01:12:11.420
start getting messages.
I knew that I've represented the stories.

1267
01:12:11.421 --> 01:12:15.200
If it was a huge surprise though,
which is why it was so good to retaliate.

1268
01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:18.650
I think that's just the way the story's gone.
Oh,
I see.

1269
01:12:18.740 --> 01:12:22.150
So the story morphs over time because it sounds better that way.
Yeah.
I know.

1270
01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:24.830
When you're doing a podcast,
when you're doing a podcast,

1271
01:12:24.831 --> 01:12:29.300
it sounds better for ticket sales.
It does.
So,

1272
01:12:29.301 --> 01:12:30.460
but it makes it,
it makes it,

1273
01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:36.470
it makes me feel better about Brendan taught him,
I don't even know this.

1274
01:12:36.471 --> 01:12:38.240
You just,
you just,
you just pumped him.

1275
01:12:41.220 --> 01:12:44.820
<v 4>You just told the truth.
But he had already told a lie,
so you pumped him.</v>

1276
01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:49.900
<v 2>That was a lie.
A lie of omission is the same.
You're right.
You're right.
Well,</v>

1277
01:12:49.901 --> 01:12:51.850
you know,
I wouldn't even say it was a lie of omission.

1278
01:12:51.851 --> 01:12:55.420
It was a lie of enhancement.
Cause you're a really good storyteller,
you know,

1279
01:12:55.510 --> 01:12:58.970
you know,
like,
look,
I,
the story is good.
Essentially.
The facts are there.
Yeah.

1280
01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:01.570
I'm going to do is I'm going to make it a good story.

1281
01:13:01.571 --> 01:13:05.050
I'm going to say that I didn't know Tom.
I'm not talking to a judge here

1282
01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:12.280
<v 4>talking to a podcast.
We love you buddy.
We love you,
man.</v>

1283
01:13:13.390 --> 01:13:17.290
Take it easy,
Bro.
Youtube pal by Brandon.

1284
01:13:17.860 --> 01:13:18.693
I'm calling you

1285
01:13:20.210 --> 01:13:21.380
<v 2>Brennan Walsh is awesome.</v>

1286
01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:26.750
I first saw him open up for Stan hope a a few years back and uh,

1287
01:13:27.020 --> 01:13:30.620
loved them ever since.
I've never seen Stan hope lied before.
I love to see him.

1288
01:13:30.621 --> 01:13:31.320
Like he's a,

1289
01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:36.320
he's in town in Irvine I think on the 30th and a I got to call him up and see if

1290
01:13:38.631 --> 01:13:41.780
we can get him on the podcast that week if that's possible.

1291
01:13:42.020 --> 01:13:45.410
But I believe it's November 30th.
He's um,

1292
01:13:45.860 --> 01:13:48.460
and I will say about the

1293
01:13:51.210 --> 01:13:55.160
SNL tweet.
I'm actually half and half on if I fully,

1294
01:13:55.161 --> 01:13:58.670
if he tweeted it and then said he tweeted it or if he was,
should I tweet it?

1295
01:13:59.530 --> 01:14:00.680
And I think it was like he tweeted,

1296
01:14:00.681 --> 01:14:04.820
it said he tweeted it and then Chelsea tweeted it after the fact like,
yeah,

1297
01:14:04.821 --> 01:14:08.740
that wasn't that,
that would be funny.
It's okay.
I want to clear it out.

1298
01:14:08.790 --> 01:14:12.640
Going to be fine.
November 30th,
Doug,
Stan is going to be at the Irvine Improv

1299
01:14:12.670 --> 01:14:16.510
<v 0>and you better buy your tickets bitches cause it shits going quick.
Guaranteed.</v>

1300
01:14:16.570 --> 01:14:20.590
He will sell out.
Doug is only in town for one night and uh,

1301
01:14:21.330 --> 01:14:24.040
Doug,
Stan Hope Fan.
If you're,
it's at the Irvine Improv.

1302
01:14:24.190 --> 01:14:26.980
If you're a comedy fan and you live anywhere in Orange County or you can make

1303
01:14:26.981 --> 01:14:29.650
the drive,
go check them out a Wednesday,

1304
01:14:29.651 --> 01:14:33.790
November 30th at eight o'clock because he's awesome.
If you should go with us,

1305
01:14:33.791 --> 01:14:36.130
we'll go,
we'll go together.
I'll do it.
You want to go?
Okay.
Wait.

1306
01:14:36.131 --> 01:14:38.950
November 30th yeah,
fine.
Actually in this day and in Portland.

1307
01:14:39.070 --> 01:14:43.750
Shizam look at you traveler like a chill work in them.
Hippie bitches.

1308
01:14:44.110 --> 01:14:47.190
Portland helion.
Come see me.
That's a great club.
Yeah,
I love that.

1309
01:14:47.260 --> 01:14:50.530
That's a fun club.
It'd be fun.
Yeah.
I love Portland.
I,

1310
01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:54.490
but you're from Seattle,
right?
I did.
You deal with the winter.

1311
01:14:54.491 --> 01:14:56.040
How w what does that law yet?
Well,

1312
01:14:56.041 --> 01:14:58.810
you don't really realize it when you're living in it for so long until you move

1313
01:14:58.811 --> 01:15:00.310
somewhere out.
When you finally live,

1314
01:15:00.311 --> 01:15:01.750
like in California during the winter and you,

1315
01:15:02.630 --> 01:15:06.250
it freaks you out because you're used to like 40 days,
no sun,

1316
01:15:06.430 --> 01:15:09.220
and you're used to people being like trying to dreary and department and then

1317
01:15:09.221 --> 01:15:10.690
when the sun comes out,
people freak out.

1318
01:15:10.691 --> 01:15:13.180
It's like the best day ever and you get out and you wash your car and you do

1319
01:15:13.181 --> 01:15:16.690
everything you can do.
Whereas here,
every day when I first moved down here,

1320
01:15:16.691 --> 01:15:19.000
it felt like every day I was just over exerting myself.
Yeah.

1321
01:15:19.001 --> 01:15:21.010
We forget about that in California,

1322
01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:23.920
that in other parts of the country when it's a nice sunny day,

1323
01:15:23.921 --> 01:15:28.300
people go out and do to celebrate.
Like in some clubs,
like the first,

1324
01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:32.830
first show tickets suffer if it's a sunny day.
Well for sure.

1325
01:15:32.830 --> 01:15:36.070
And if it's in some way,
sometimes if it's a rainy day,
just getting people out.

1326
01:15:36.130 --> 01:15:37.580
Yeah,
it's true.
Yeah.
Well that's,

1327
01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:40.060
and that's it in like Middle America where people are just like,
ah,

1328
01:15:40.090 --> 01:15:43.340
we're just going through this shit.
We don't care.
There's nothing else to do.

1329
01:15:43.410 --> 01:15:47.740
Yeah.
We figured it out and it's not bad.
You know?
I love going to,

1330
01:15:48.010 --> 01:15:49.750
I love doing stand up all over the place.

1331
01:15:49.751 --> 01:15:53.620
I think one of the coolest things about this job is that you really do get to

1332
01:15:53.621 --> 01:15:55.690
have like these little bases,
you know,

1333
01:15:55.691 --> 01:15:59.680
like you go to these places on a regular basis and you're getting a taste of

1334
01:15:59.681 --> 01:16:02.310
everything.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And you also have like this,
you know,

1335
01:16:02.311 --> 01:16:05.170
like you draw on a town,
you get used to coming to a town,

1336
01:16:05.171 --> 01:16:08.020
you develop fans and it's how you have like a relationship with those people.

1337
01:16:08.020 --> 01:16:10.420
I'm just having towns van,
I'm like three or four times back.

1338
01:16:10.450 --> 01:16:15.010
It's nice the people come back to see you again.
You know,
like Austin,

1339
01:16:15.011 --> 01:16:18.220
Texas is a perfect,
I just did that.
Yeah,
we could go places,

1340
01:16:18.221 --> 01:16:21.790
great cap city comedy club and every time we go there it's like we,

1341
01:16:22.270 --> 01:16:25.390
I see a lot of the same faces,
you know?
It was a lot of same people afterwards.

1342
01:16:25.391 --> 01:16:27.660
You take pictures with so fun fucking time.

1343
01:16:27.670 --> 01:16:31.120
They've got a lot of regulars clubs like that.
Yeah.
That's a club.

1344
01:16:31.121 --> 01:16:33.580
It's been around forever,
man.
That's,
that's one of the,

1345
01:16:33.940 --> 01:16:36.940
this is one of the ones that everybody wants to go to and it's an independent

1346
01:16:36.941 --> 01:16:39.520
club.
It's kind of interesting.
What hotel do you stand when you go there?

1347
01:16:39.700 --> 01:16:42.880
I ain't tell y'all that Internet fucking crazy.
You don't,

1348
01:16:42.881 --> 01:16:45.760
you don't stay where they've put people.
I don't know what you're talking about.

1349
01:16:46.270 --> 01:16:49.810
Their places the worst.
Why is it bad?
It's a cop hotel,

1350
01:16:50.170 --> 01:16:53.700
so sometimes there's like 30 cop cars in the parking lot at night times.

1351
01:16:53.900 --> 01:16:57.970
That's good.
That's a good place to stay.
Just seems scary.

1352
01:16:58.150 --> 01:17:02.320
Just don't smoke weed in your room.
Yeah.
Or anywhere within a that's not fun.

1353
01:17:02.350 --> 01:17:04.060
Yeah.
You gotta worry about Texas.

1354
01:17:04.061 --> 01:17:07.630
Texas is a different animal when it comes to getting arrested for Shit and

1355
01:17:07.631 --> 01:17:10.330
Austin,
they're actually really lax about it and their shower

1356
01:17:10.340 --> 01:17:12.680
<v 1>don't give a fuck about it.
You can see into your shower</v>

1357
01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:15.560
<v 5>or from the bed.
There's no wall.
I hate that shit.
Like in Vegas,</v>

1358
01:17:15.561 --> 01:17:17.750
when you go to Mandalay band,
you'd walk in and it's like,
oh,

1359
01:17:17.751 --> 01:17:19.670
there's the bathroom so you can see anyone,

1360
01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:21.590
anyone who went to taking the shower and shit.

1361
01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:24.650
<v 1>Did you see that Obama pardoned?
Uh,</v>

1362
01:17:24.660 --> 01:17:27.810
a bunch of people and some of them were drug offenders,

1363
01:17:28.170 --> 01:17:31.500
some woman who was um,
shit,
20 years for cocaine.

1364
01:17:31.501 --> 01:17:33.210
He commuted her sentence to 10.

1365
01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:37.590
He released her after 10 years served and some other,
uh,

1366
01:17:37.680 --> 01:17:39.420
marijuana offenses.

1367
01:17:39.480 --> 01:17:43.680
He has hard and people fucking just knock all those people out of jails.

1368
01:17:44.340 --> 01:17:48.690
It's gotta be a
United States.

1369
01:17:51.230 --> 01:17:54.570
Um,
I don't know what the state,
their crimes were committed in,
but you know,

1370
01:17:54.930 --> 01:17:58.260
this day and age,
man,
it's really a crime.

1371
01:17:58.261 --> 01:18:01.130
The real crime is putting people in jail for it.
It's there.

1372
01:18:01.380 --> 01:18:03.870
That's the real crime.
I've heard a lot of on jail for drugs.

1373
01:18:04.020 --> 01:18:05.030
People in New York lately,

1374
01:18:05.031 --> 01:18:07.410
they've been having a lot of undercover people on the street catching people

1375
01:18:07.411 --> 01:18:12.020
smoking joints.
It's been like a big thing.
Of course Bloomberg has a cut.
He's a,

1376
01:18:12.030 --> 01:18:13.550
there's an old rich cunt.
All those,

1377
01:18:13.551 --> 01:18:17.310
those crazy old men that they don't understand that the system doesn't apply

1378
01:18:17.311 --> 01:18:18.660
anymore.
It doesn't work anymore.

1379
01:18:18.810 --> 01:18:21.090
It doesn't represent the will of the people and people know it.

1380
01:18:21.091 --> 01:18:23.490
And that's why there's a fucking million people in the streets.

1381
01:18:23.790 --> 01:18:27.870
It's not temporary.
This is,
this is the beginning of the end and these old guys,

1382
01:18:27.871 --> 01:18:30.660
they don't get it.
That's why Giuliana is on TV going,

1383
01:18:30.810 --> 01:18:33.810
why don't you occupy a job?

1384
01:18:34.290 --> 01:18:38.370
How about your further your education?
Like it's that easy.

1385
01:18:38.460 --> 01:18:40.020
Like if you could just go get a job.

1386
01:18:40.021 --> 01:18:45.021
What a creepy old asshole old rich man who makes his living giving boring ass

1387
01:18:46.381 --> 01:18:50.580
fucking speeches.
I saw one of his speeches when it was post nine 11 speeches.

1388
01:18:50.730 --> 01:18:54.920
He was just riding this wave of him being the hero of nine 11.
He,

1389
01:18:55.100 --> 01:18:59.490
he took that in the grossest way possible and ran with it politically,
you know,

1390
01:18:59.491 --> 01:19:02.760
that he uh,
was strong while that happened.
And you know,

1391
01:19:02.761 --> 01:19:06.510
Giuliani represented leadership under duress and every time that's something

1392
01:19:06.511 --> 01:19:10.880
that you know,
that people that aren't in struggle latch onto an event,

1393
01:19:10.890 --> 01:19:15.270
a tragic event to help them get out of it.
Yeah,
it's horrible.
It's weak.

1394
01:19:15.750 --> 01:19:16.650
It's gross.

1395
01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:20.220
But what's more gross as you saying something so ignorant as why don't you

1396
01:19:20.221 --> 01:19:23.170
occupy a job?
You're telling people that the,
the,

1397
01:19:23.460 --> 01:19:28.170
the people that are down there shouldn't be allowed to protest.

1398
01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:30.900
They shouldn't be allowed to peacefully demonstrate.

1399
01:19:31.050 --> 01:19:35.730
Isn't that like a part of what makes us America is that we can all get together

1400
01:19:35.731 --> 01:19:38.260
as a group and say,
hey,
we don't appreciate this.
Yeah.

1401
01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:41.040
I've been wondering about the laws on that and how all of a sudden it's just

1402
01:19:41.041 --> 01:19:43.230
like cracking down.
I do have to,

1403
01:19:43.270 --> 01:19:46.800
the real problem is they realized now that it's not going to go away.

1404
01:19:46.830 --> 01:19:49.980
I think they initially let it happen because they thought people were going to

1405
01:19:49.981 --> 01:19:51.690
get tired of it and it was going to go away,

1406
01:19:51.900 --> 01:19:56.460
but now the momentum behind it is,
it's absurd.

1407
01:19:56.820 --> 01:19:59.700
I've never seen anything like this.
The momentum behind it,

1408
01:19:59.701 --> 01:20:03.270
it's the point where they have to acknowledge it on mainstream news.

1409
01:20:03.271 --> 01:20:05.070
It's on TV all the time.

1410
01:20:05.100 --> 01:20:09.990
It's the images are flooding the Internet and the amount of press that's

1411
01:20:10.020 --> 01:20:14.460
covering it on TV in comparison to the Internet is still relatively small

1412
01:20:14.700 --> 01:20:17.970
because a huge percentage of the Internet is dedicated to the stories that are

1413
01:20:17.971 --> 01:20:21.270
going on down there.
The girl who you were talking about who is pregnant,

1414
01:20:21.271 --> 01:20:25.980
who miscarried the 89 year old or 84 year old woman that got pepper Seattle

1415
01:20:25.981 --> 01:20:27.110
face.
Yeah.

1416
01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:30.960
All these people that are getting beaten with clubs and and all the wild.

1417
01:20:30.961 --> 01:20:35.370
These protesters have been amazing.
They're just not,
they're not fighting back.

1418
01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:36.233
They're just there.

1419
01:20:36.270 --> 01:20:40.200
They're sitting there getting blasted in the face while they're on their knees

1420
01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:42.360
is calm.
I want to,
I'd love to see the,

1421
01:20:42.450 --> 01:20:46.260
the interview of a guy right after getting exposed on the Internet like that,

1422
01:20:46.290 --> 01:20:48.870
you know the job or it's just like,
ah shit.
I forgot.

1423
01:20:48.871 --> 01:20:50.020
People are watching all the time.

1424
01:20:50.021 --> 01:20:55.021
I don't think they have any idea how responsible people are going to hold them

1425
01:20:55.290 --> 01:20:57.990
for that.
How accountable people are going to hold them for that.

1426
01:20:57.991 --> 01:21:00.300
That got pepper sprayed.
All those kids in the face,

1427
01:21:00.570 --> 01:21:03.510
the pepper sprayed people's little girls and little boys because they were

1428
01:21:03.511 --> 01:21:06.050
protesting you,
motherfucker did you do?

1429
01:21:06.090 --> 01:21:09.840
Do we not learn anything from the sexual lives?
Just get ruined by that.
Yeah.

1430
01:21:10.020 --> 01:21:14.580
Other stories of that girl that had like a Vlog or live Ustream she was doing

1431
01:21:14.581 --> 01:21:18.210
and people just started just hating on her so hard and then her dad got involved

1432
01:21:18.211 --> 01:21:21.480
in embarrassed or even more and it just like their phones were going off the

1433
01:21:21.481 --> 01:21:25.620
hook.
I mean it was just so terrible,
but it just gets brutal.
Yeah,

1434
01:21:25.710 --> 01:21:26.850
the whole thing is brutal.

1435
01:21:26.910 --> 01:21:31.860
I mean it's like people are starting to take into consideration the very real

1436
01:21:31.861 --> 01:21:35.820
possibility that our civilization might be collapsing right in front of our face

1437
01:21:36.390 --> 01:21:39.730
and that this is just one step in,
uh,

1438
01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:45.700
and erosion of our current state of life or current.
You know,

1439
01:21:46.650 --> 01:21:49.890
our way of life,
you know,
and this is if there's no money in that,

1440
01:21:49.891 --> 01:21:51.120
things can't stay the same.

1441
01:21:51.121 --> 01:21:54.840
You can't have the same amount of food in the supermarkets and the same amount

1442
01:21:54.841 --> 01:21:56.080
of gas and what,

1443
01:21:56.320 --> 01:22:01.280
what is going to happen if it really gets to a point where our economy
collapses?

1444
01:22:01.330 --> 01:22:05.820
Does anybody really prepared to wait in line to buy food and to have like a loaf

1445
01:22:05.821 --> 01:22:08.040
of bread be 500 bucks or something he imagined,

1446
01:22:08.070 --> 01:22:10.140
you know what the fuck happens when it gets that bad?

1447
01:22:10.590 --> 01:22:13.140
Moved back home to mom and plant some tomatoes.

1448
01:22:13.970 --> 01:22:15.510
You got a definitely got to grow your own food.

1449
01:22:15.511 --> 01:22:18.720
But fuck is it becomes a question.
Like,

1450
01:22:18.721 --> 01:22:21.300
is it possible that I could slide that far back?

1451
01:22:21.390 --> 01:22:24.750
Because right now everybody's complaining and it does look terrible and yeah,

1452
01:22:24.751 --> 01:22:29.340
the government totally sucks.
But if things froze right here in time,

1453
01:22:30.930 --> 01:22:34.240
life ain't that bad.
You know,
right now we can get gas right now.
Uh,

1454
01:22:34.250 --> 01:22:36.390
I get on direct TV,
I got 250 channels.

1455
01:22:36.540 --> 01:22:38.370
My Internet is not the fastest in the world,

1456
01:22:38.371 --> 01:22:41.010
but it's a lot better than it was 10 years ago.
I've got my health,

1457
01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:44.640
you know what I'm saying?
Let's stop right here.
But you can't stop right here.

1458
01:22:44.641 --> 01:22:46.560
You can't stop right here because we're still in debt.

1459
01:22:46.830 --> 01:22:50.190
Who knows how many trillion dollars.
You're also so much more aware.
Yeah.

1460
01:22:50.260 --> 01:22:52.530
And then people were,
oh yeah.
You know,

1461
01:22:52.750 --> 01:22:55.890
to where it was like they might not be aware of how bad things were at certain

1462
01:22:55.891 --> 01:22:56.870
points.
Well this a,

1463
01:22:56.871 --> 01:23:00.600
this is enough shocking information on the Internet right now where if you're

1464
01:23:00.601 --> 01:23:03.690
not concerned,
then you're simply not paying attention.
You know,

1465
01:23:03.691 --> 01:23:07.390
when you start reading about these 16 billion or trillion dollars in secret

1466
01:23:07.391 --> 01:23:11.500
bailouts,
they uncovered with an audit of the Fed,
16 trillion.

1467
01:23:11.890 --> 01:23:14.770
I don't even know how many Zeros that is,
but that's an insane,

1468
01:23:14.771 --> 01:23:19.270
I know that's more than the gross domestic product product to the entire United

1469
01:23:19.270 --> 01:23:21.400
States.
And that was all given out.
And the bailouts,

1470
01:23:21.401 --> 01:23:25.420
he's no interest loans all secretly,
uh,
an approved,

1471
01:23:26.070 --> 01:23:28.030
it's a God damn money grab man.

1472
01:23:28.180 --> 01:23:31.420
It's a money grab and there's a reason why these people are in the street and it

1473
01:23:31.421 --> 01:23:34.690
ain't just because they're hippies cause there's a lot of them that are there

1474
01:23:34.691 --> 01:23:38.500
just because they're hippies,
you know,
they would be there if it was,
you know,

1475
01:23:38.501 --> 01:23:42.060
a flower festival or a grateful dead tribute band,
you know,
they would,

1476
01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:43.151
they would be there.

1477
01:23:43.151 --> 01:23:45.490
I wonder if there's also been like homeless people that have just been like,

1478
01:23:45.610 --> 01:23:48.700
yeah,
they're fucking psyched or the place,
yes,
there's a place for me to stay.

1479
01:23:49.060 --> 01:23:51.010
Of course you're definitely going to have that.

1480
01:23:51.010 --> 01:23:54.370
But on top of that you've got a lot of really intelligent people.

1481
01:23:54.700 --> 01:23:56.260
What's really interesting is the difference.

1482
01:23:56.261 --> 01:24:01.261
There was a video that I watched yesterday on how Fox News covered the tea party

1483
01:24:01.840 --> 01:24:05.290
and how they're covering this and the tea party they were describing as a grass

1484
01:24:05.530 --> 01:24:09.970
roots movement with no discernible a leader who,

1485
01:24:09.971 --> 01:24:14.500
and it all came together organically there essentially describing occupy Wall

1486
01:24:14.501 --> 01:24:18.820
Street.
But there were,
there were saying it will the mainstream media cover this.

1487
01:24:18.940 --> 01:24:22.570
That's the real question.
Like,
and I'm watching this like what the fuck are you,

1488
01:24:22.780 --> 01:24:23.980
you fox?
You know,

1489
01:24:23.981 --> 01:24:28.210
this isn't some underground new sources sneaking out the information to the

1490
01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:32.150
brave men and women of America.
So skewed.
There's there Fox and they're,

1491
01:24:32.151 --> 01:24:35.290
they're pretending that they're not the mainstream media.
You're not there.

1492
01:24:35.291 --> 01:24:39.160
Not only are they covering the tea party,
but they're promoting it there.

1493
01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:42.940
The people are fed up and you know what I think I see their point and they,

1494
01:24:42.941 --> 01:24:45.970
you know,
they're editorializing as they're given this news.

1495
01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:48.940
And then they were talking about occupy Wall Street and they were saying that

1496
01:24:48.941 --> 01:24:51.160
it's not going to last and there's no,

1497
01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:54.610
there's no message behind and you can't find one person.

1498
01:24:54.730 --> 01:24:55.780
And then they have videos.

1499
01:24:55.781 --> 01:25:00.370
It showed videos of intelligent people explaining what's wrong,

1500
01:25:00.371 --> 01:25:02.820
explaining what they're trying to accomplish and explaining how they're going to

1501
01:25:02.830 --> 01:25:07.030
go about doing it.
And they didn't use any of that shit on TV,

1502
01:25:07.390 --> 01:25:11.080
any of it.
And then,
you know,
he showed all the videos that people have done.

1503
01:25:11.081 --> 01:25:13.150
Like there's this one guy,
I forget his name,
but he's brilliant.

1504
01:25:13.330 --> 01:25:15.520
He goes to Sarah Pailin book signings.

1505
01:25:15.521 --> 01:25:19.370
He goes to the tea party things in the interviews and he clowned something.

1506
01:25:19.380 --> 01:25:23.180
We just get some to eat.
They don't even know.
He's not,
he's,

1507
01:25:23.300 --> 01:25:25.420
they don't even know that he's filming like a parody.

1508
01:25:25.660 --> 01:25:26.840
They don't even know that he's,
you know,

1509
01:25:26.860 --> 01:25:29.950
just going to get them to say really stupid shit and show how a different

1510
01:25:29.951 --> 01:25:33.280
costumes they're just think,
just wears a tie.
And I forget what his name is.

1511
01:25:33.281 --> 01:25:36.310
I'm really doing him a disservice because he's hilarious.
Um,

1512
01:25:36.340 --> 01:25:41.340
but my point was it's easy to find just a few people and use those people to

1513
01:25:42.041 --> 01:25:43.300
discredit the tea party.

1514
01:25:43.570 --> 01:25:46.480
I use those people discredit occupy Wall Street or whatever.

1515
01:25:46.481 --> 01:25:49.840
But when you got a movement that's as big as this fucking thing is,

1516
01:25:49.841 --> 01:25:53.480
they showed a picture of,
uh,
New York City where the,

1517
01:25:53.481 --> 01:25:56.410
the occupy movement was going on and that you see like how many people were

1518
01:25:56.411 --> 01:26:00.640
there.
It is gigantic,
man.
Yeah,
it's huge.
It's gigantic.

1519
01:26:00.641 --> 01:26:02.590
It was like a shot from the helicopter.
I went with him.

1520
01:26:02.650 --> 01:26:03.980
I haven't seen what it's like now.
I

1521
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:08.210
<v 0>was,
I went there like a month ago and saw,
you know what it was at that point.</v>

1522
01:26:08.420 --> 01:26:12.670
It's bigger,
it's bigger,
you know,
I mean,
it's really amazing that,
uh,

1523
01:26:12.740 --> 01:26:16.160
his little violence has happened,
you know,
really is,

1524
01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:19.010
it's really kind of incredible.
He's really using the product.

1525
01:26:19.070 --> 01:26:22.670
He's going to go crazy right now.
He's feeling stupid.
It's fill all stupid.

1526
01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:26.720
He's worried that one of the Illuminati come.
He might not have enough brains.

1527
01:26:26.721 --> 01:26:29.830
Get out of the way.
You know,

1528
01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:34.100
it's the real question for me about all this is not whether or not it's going to

1529
01:26:34.101 --> 01:26:36.860
grow,
because it's definitely going to grow.
People are loving it.

1530
01:26:36.890 --> 01:26:39.650
They're loving it.
They're,
they're,
they're,
they're,
they have a voice.

1531
01:26:39.770 --> 01:26:42.830
People feel like for the longest time,
you know,

1532
01:26:42.831 --> 01:26:44.420
they know that they've been fucked.

1533
01:26:44.510 --> 01:26:49.100
They know that the government has been inept and using their tax dollars.

1534
01:26:49.101 --> 01:26:53.090
They know that laws have been passed that benefit.
Corporations only,

1535
01:26:53.091 --> 01:26:55.850
and not people at all.
They know that all this has happened,

1536
01:26:55.851 --> 01:26:57.320
but they haven't been able to do anything about it.

1537
01:26:57.590 --> 01:27:00.050
And they have this pent up shit inside of them,

1538
01:27:00.051 --> 01:27:03.410
and now they're standing in the street altogether and they feel like they're

1539
01:27:03.411 --> 01:27:05.990
getting something done just by getting their,
their voice out.

1540
01:27:06.380 --> 01:27:09.680
But the problem is unemployment's band,
it's not going to get any better,

1541
01:27:09.710 --> 01:27:11.870
and this isn't gonna go away.
It's going to get bigger.

1542
01:27:11.900 --> 01:27:13.550
And people are gonna start wanting results.

1543
01:27:13.700 --> 01:27:15.470
They're going to start wanting something to happen.
Well,

1544
01:27:15.471 --> 01:27:19.400
somebody should probably step forward at some point as I spoke.
I mean,
you know,

1545
01:27:19.490 --> 01:27:22.010
yeah,
I don't think so.
I don't think anybody will,

1546
01:27:22.011 --> 01:27:25.620
but I think that would don't think right guy came out.
I mean,
yeah,

1547
01:27:25.630 --> 01:27:27.690
but I don't think they examine anonymous mass gone.

1548
01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:32.200
He's going to take it off and it's Obama and modern day.
Whoa.
Imagine that.

1549
01:27:32.420 --> 01:27:36.500
Holy Shit,
John Lennon.
Imagine it.
It was Obama who was working at both sides.

1550
01:27:36.620 --> 01:27:39.560
That'd be a great movie in the basement of best buy.

1551
01:27:39.561 --> 01:27:42.410
It's like at this round table and they all take off their anonymous mask and

1552
01:27:42.411 --> 01:27:46.630
it's all like Ronald Reagan and he's turning to Sanders and his dead.
Bob Hope,

1553
01:27:48.410 --> 01:27:51.380
Bob Hope.
And then that is a fucking great idea for a movie though.

1554
01:27:51.381 --> 01:27:55.420
President Brandon Walsh president gets into office and really thinks he's going

1555
01:27:55.421 --> 01:27:56.254
to be the president.

1556
01:27:56.590 --> 01:27:59.800
He thinks he's going to get in there and he's going to fix things and he's going

1557
01:27:59.801 --> 01:28:01.550
to change the world.
And then once he gets in there,

1558
01:28:01.551 --> 01:28:04.580
he has to deal with all these special interest groups in the military.

1559
01:28:04.581 --> 01:28:09.200
Industrial Complex and all these creepy flux that are essentially starting wars

1560
01:28:09.201 --> 01:28:12.830
for profit and there's no way around it.
He can't,
he has to stick to the agenda.

1561
01:28:12.980 --> 01:28:15.620
It's that money that got him into office in the first place,

1562
01:28:15.710 --> 01:28:17.750
but he'll cover designs.

1563
01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:22.070
He designs occupy Wall Street and he's a part of anonymous and he's attacking it

1564
01:28:22.071 --> 01:28:24.110
from the inside and providing them with information.

1565
01:28:24.850 --> 01:28:29.850
This is the movie and they can fly and they can make gold out of poop.

1566
01:28:32.300 --> 01:28:35.270
That's got to be got to vote for this guy.
Yeah.
It's good to be Herman Cain

1567
01:28:37.180 --> 01:28:41.950
with his wink and it's smoking friend Herman Cain.
Celeris.
I liked it.

1568
01:28:41.960 --> 01:28:46.040
He likes white chicks though.
Trying to hit up on some white chucks.
Got Boston.

1569
01:28:46.250 --> 01:28:49.730
Yeah,
I hit that.
I haven't,
no one's actually come forward for though.

1570
01:28:50.930 --> 01:28:53.960
I thought that they got people,
not a bad looking older lady.

1571
01:28:53.990 --> 01:28:55.950
Neighbors came forward.
Okay.

1572
01:28:56.210 --> 01:28:58.790
No Herman Cains girl came forward to at least one of them.

1573
01:28:58.791 --> 01:29:02.190
I think a couple of them come forth.
It's whatever of people like said something,

1574
01:29:02.190 --> 01:29:03.390
<v 1>but then they never made it official.</v>

1575
01:29:03.660 --> 01:29:07.470
If Kennedy had tried to run for president today,
nobody can have flaws anymore.

1576
01:29:07.471 --> 01:29:09.420
It's like we were talking about with Julian Assange's.
Yeah.

1577
01:29:09.421 --> 01:29:12.120
He dances like a creep and he'd probably stuck it in that girl when they were

1578
01:29:12.121 --> 01:29:13.020
lying next to each other,

1579
01:29:13.021 --> 01:29:16.100
but she shouldn't have been sleeping with him in the first place.
You know?

1580
01:29:16.110 --> 01:29:18.360
What are you doing naked laying next to Julian Assange?

1581
01:29:18.850 --> 01:29:21.710
Anything at any point could come back and bite you.
Yeah,

1582
01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:22.890
the whole thing is weird.

1583
01:29:23.190 --> 01:29:25.500
That's the internet just can make it harder and harder for people to get.

1584
01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:28.830
It's so true though,
that they can lock this guy up.
You know,

1585
01:29:28.831 --> 01:29:30.480
that's not what you're mad at him for,

1586
01:29:30.590 --> 01:29:32.700
but you're mad at him for releasing all those secrets.

1587
01:29:32.701 --> 01:29:37.320
But what he did is really what a real journalist is supposed to do.
You know,

1588
01:29:37.321 --> 01:29:41.640
I mean,
someone said to,
to him,
um,
what would be the difference between,
you know,

1589
01:29:41.641 --> 01:29:45.990
this information coming from you or coming from the New York Times and you know,

1590
01:29:45.991 --> 01:29:48.840
and what he said was,
I'm not exactly sure the New York Times.

1591
01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:52.240
I think you said this.
Maybe there's somebody else said this,
I'm,

1592
01:29:52.300 --> 01:29:56.000
I don't want to quote him.
Essentially it wasn't Ziggy.
Um,

1593
01:29:56.040 --> 01:29:58.830
but essentially what they were saying was,
um,

1594
01:29:59.310 --> 01:30:04.080
he might be the only group that would just release all of it.
Whereas if that,

1595
01:30:04.110 --> 01:30:05.940
that material was sent to the Washington Post,

1596
01:30:05.941 --> 01:30:09.750
or if that material was sent to any legitimate quote unquote corporate sponsored

1597
01:30:09.751 --> 01:30:11.340
major new shores,
they,

1598
01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:16.710
you're supposed to release that information like the video of the,
um,
the Apache,

1599
01:30:16.740 --> 01:30:19.580
those,
whatever those helicopters shooting those,

1600
01:30:19.581 --> 01:30:21.870
those kids in the car and those people that are on the street.

1601
01:30:21.871 --> 01:30:24.930
And I was innocent people.
I mean that,
that's the way they were talking about it.

1602
01:30:24.931 --> 01:30:27.780
They shouldn't have brought their kids like it was,
it was dark.
You know,

1603
01:30:27.781 --> 01:30:30.150
there's kids that should,
should've brought their kids like up,
right?

1604
01:30:30.180 --> 01:30:34.320
Like they're not,
they didn't feel bad about it at all.
And the fact that this is,

1605
01:30:34.350 --> 01:30:38.340
these are American soldiers and this is,
it's possible to get to this mindset.

1606
01:30:38.430 --> 01:30:42.250
That's a very important fact for us to know as a nation.
They're very,

1607
01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:46.560
we should be informed to make our decisions about how we truly feel about war,

1608
01:30:46.800 --> 01:30:50.850
you know?
And if we're shielding the public from information like that,

1609
01:30:50.851 --> 01:30:54.540
in my opinion,
that is like treason.
That is like,

1610
01:30:54.630 --> 01:30:59.130
that's like espionage.
That's like you're,
you're shielding important information.

1611
01:30:59.160 --> 01:31:00.300
Just to think about how many,

1612
01:31:00.301 --> 01:31:04.800
I mean the possibilities of how unreal these stories can be that nobody will

1613
01:31:04.801 --> 01:31:08.220
ever know that are just always being bought and hidden.
And I'm sure,
yeah,

1614
01:31:08.221 --> 01:31:11.500
I mean at any point could just come out when you hear all,

1615
01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:13.920
I mean there's been several instances of,

1616
01:31:14.100 --> 01:31:18.750
especially the black water and other soldiers being accused of killing
civilians.

1617
01:31:18.960 --> 01:31:21.120
It's like,
it's not one instance,
it's several.

1618
01:31:21.120 --> 01:31:23.190
There's another guy who got arrested recently and they were,

1619
01:31:23.191 --> 01:31:27.300
they were saving fingers and shit and killing civilians.
You know,

1620
01:31:28.210 --> 01:31:32.310
when you hear about these instances that it not everyone's getting caught.
Okay.

1621
01:31:32.340 --> 01:31:35.070
There's some people that are pulling shit off and they're getting away with it

1622
01:31:35.071 --> 01:31:35.910
and they have to cover it up.

1623
01:31:35.911 --> 01:31:40.080
But then every now and then someone would go crazy and kill like 20 or 30 people

1624
01:31:40.081 --> 01:31:43.840
and then they have to,
you know,
they have a situation,
you know,
I mean it's,
it's,

1625
01:31:43.841 --> 01:31:47.340
it's very dark.
It's very dark.
You're asking people to kill people.

1626
01:31:47.520 --> 01:31:50.910
You're asking people to kill and then you're going to let them just roam free in

1627
01:31:50.911 --> 01:31:51.601
the population.

1628
01:31:51.601 --> 01:31:54.330
Like someone who's never killed before as it remind me of the people I can

1629
01:31:54.331 --> 01:31:57.360
Bourne identity that are the ones that are always trying to kill Jason Bourne

1630
01:31:57.361 --> 01:31:59.800
that has keep hiring like another guy.

1631
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:03.310
<v 5>I don't watch those movies.
You don't shut it.
Oh God,
I love him.</v>

1632
01:32:03.460 --> 01:32:07.540
I'm not in breast with his Jujitsu.
I like watching those moves.

1633
01:32:07.541 --> 01:32:09.250
I don't believe it.
You should write.

1634
01:32:09.251 --> 01:32:12.070
You should watch it with Pete Holmes stopped watching Dexter because he did a

1635
01:32:12.071 --> 01:32:16.420
bad jujitsu move during the best season with John.

1636
01:32:16.421 --> 01:32:20.350
Lithgow has a shitty rear naked choke.
Okay.
Shitty.
And it's not how you,

1637
01:32:20.380 --> 01:32:22.090
it's not what happens when he choke somebody out.
God,

1638
01:32:22.091 --> 01:32:26.170
if you were to watch Dexter now,
you would just fall asleep.

1639
01:32:26.890 --> 01:32:29.800
It's horrible.
Even that directing is,

1640
01:32:29.920 --> 01:32:33.160
I can't tell cause I just got used to watching a show and then cause I like

1641
01:32:33.220 --> 01:32:35.200
Michael see hall's character so much.

1642
01:32:35.201 --> 01:32:38.400
I just don't like what's going on around him.
And he got sick too.

1643
01:32:38.940 --> 01:32:40.090
That's when it was weird too.

1644
01:32:40.270 --> 01:32:43.600
[inaudible] is married to the girl that plays anymore.
They broke up

1645
01:32:45.100 --> 01:32:47.280
scenes together.
It's so weird.
Yeah,

1646
01:32:47.330 --> 01:32:49.900
it's weird knowing that they boned and they're playing with brothers and sisters

1647
01:32:49.901 --> 01:32:54.400
on the show and [inaudible] heart is broken.
Well that's what I mean.

1648
01:32:54.440 --> 01:32:57.790
Like I'm a dumb fucking the career move,
isn't it?

1649
01:32:57.791 --> 01:33:00.220
I mean that's a really silly move,
Dude.
Fuck.
Would you,

1650
01:33:00.221 --> 01:33:04.300
do you remember their kids remember like what happened to his wife and he has

1651
01:33:04.301 --> 01:33:09.210
kids,
you know,
like he does,
he has kids on the show.
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1652
01:33:09.220 --> 01:33:12.260
The girl,
they don't even exist anymore.
Like they don't,

1653
01:33:12.390 --> 01:33:17.280
they haven't talked about him all season.
They were the grandparents forever.

1654
01:33:17.310 --> 01:33:20.290
They went to the grandparents.
They don't talk.
It's your kid.

1655
01:33:20.291 --> 01:33:23.950
You would talk to him every day.
He's got that boy though.
Made me sexy.

1656
01:33:23.951 --> 01:33:26.710
She's sexy in some weird kind of crazy bitch way.

1657
01:33:26.890 --> 01:33:29.630
Is there a water I can grab in there?
Yeah.
What do you want man?
Hold on one.

1658
01:33:29.680 --> 01:33:33.220
Want water,
diet coke,
energy drink coconut water,
coconut water.

1659
01:33:36.470 --> 01:33:40.750
You got us the C two I love that stuff.

1660
01:33:40.990 --> 01:33:41.860
Especially cold.

1661
01:33:45.410 --> 01:33:47.800
So do you.
I went to a party,

1662
01:33:48.210 --> 01:33:50.560
it was a benefit for a hope field,

1663
01:33:50.620 --> 01:33:54.970
which is an annual thing and I saw some,
they had,

1664
01:33:54.971 --> 01:33:58.420
it was a small low party and they had some of the best musicians there ever.

1665
01:33:59.110 --> 01:34:02.180
Women Singing Natasha Bedingfield is there.

1666
01:34:02.980 --> 01:34:07.360
Natasha Bedingfield.
She's the one I think that sings the song to the hills.
Oh,

1667
01:34:07.361 --> 01:34:10.140
so this was like a big time.
Yeah.
Yeah,
yeah.

1668
01:34:10.150 --> 01:34:13.780
This is like all ace celebrities there.
And I talked to Jeremy Pivot.

1669
01:34:13.820 --> 01:34:17.140
He said he wants to do the podcast.
I Leona Lewis was the main girl.

1670
01:34:17.350 --> 01:34:22.350
But you know after seeing them it was so amazing to get off stage that I was

1671
01:34:22.361 --> 01:34:26.860
like in love.
Like I was obsessed with these,
these female singers.

1672
01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:29.230
Do you get that?
Cause you played guitar on stage a lot.

1673
01:34:29.231 --> 01:34:34.231
Do you get your version of Fan doing comedy and guitar?

1674
01:34:35.110 --> 01:34:37.430
You'd probably get it messy.
Slang that,
yeah.

1675
01:34:40.690 --> 01:34:43.200
Yeah.
They do sling it out.
There's a lot of slinging.
Yeah.

1676
01:34:43.210 --> 01:34:46.270
There's a lot of rubber.
No,
I don't.
I don't.
I find with the,
you know,

1677
01:34:46.870 --> 01:34:50.260
especially comedy nerds,
you know,
they're not necessarily out front.

1678
01:34:50.350 --> 01:34:54.040
It's not like I'm in a band.
It's a whole different audience.
I'm making myself.

1679
01:34:54.041 --> 01:34:55.540
I'm making a fool of myself essentially.

1680
01:34:55.780 --> 01:34:58.400
Whereas they're just continually looking cool the whole time they're out there.

1681
01:34:58.760 --> 01:35:02.390
Yeah.
It's totally different.
Sexual vibe.
Girls love to laugh though.

1682
01:35:02.420 --> 01:35:05.440
Playing a song that's a whole different kind of hypnotizing now,

1683
01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:10.030
even if it is a joke or making fun of yourself,
it's something that adds to it.

1684
01:35:10.031 --> 01:35:13.400
And we were talking about Leonard Skinner being fat dirty white guys from

1685
01:35:13.401 --> 01:35:16.040
Florida,
but they knew how to make some sound.

1686
01:35:16.460 --> 01:35:20.060
They know how to make some sounds that are delicious.
They're delicious.
The cars,

1687
01:35:20.061 --> 01:35:22.940
like you see these bands that the way they look.
I mean it's still,
yeah,

1688
01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:26.780
it's sexy.
I mean,
Rick,
I find myself attracted to girl to her,
you know,

1689
01:35:26.840 --> 01:35:29.360
any that are just talented like that doesn't matter.

1690
01:35:29.420 --> 01:35:32.720
Do you find yourself sexually attracted to them?
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

1691
01:35:32.721 --> 01:35:37.520
Wears off though after your bone them.
Oh,
I'm sure there was a girl.
Oh yeah.

1692
01:35:37.521 --> 01:35:38.311
I'm sure it's got it.

1693
01:35:38.311 --> 01:35:43.311
It only gets happened that that's happened with almost every girl that except my

1694
01:35:43.581 --> 01:35:48.260
wife,
but yeah,
it does the,
every time I see a girl singing it just turns me on.

1695
01:35:48.261 --> 01:35:50.140
I can't help it.
I just want her.
Yeah.

1696
01:35:50.180 --> 01:35:54.470
For a lot of dudes either becomes a con.
Is that what it is,

1697
01:35:54.471 --> 01:35:58.240
the confidence to sit down in front of him and performed?
Reform.
Yeah.

1698
01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:01.970
God that that one chick though.
I'm seriously in love with Leona Lewis,

1699
01:36:01.971 --> 01:36:03.200
like I was just,

1700
01:36:03.270 --> 01:36:05.930
she's going to find out about it and she's going to put a restraining order and

1701
01:36:05.970 --> 01:36:06.803
I don't care.

1702
01:36:07.280 --> 01:36:09.900
You're going to be sitting in the front row and she's going to choke and she's

1703
01:36:09.901 --> 01:36:12.950
going to,
their voice is going to cry.
I do.
You know what she looks like?

1704
01:36:12.951 --> 01:36:16.730
Have you ever seen her fucking gorgeous?
What's her name?
Leona Lewis.

1705
01:36:16.790 --> 01:36:18.410
And she pulled a picture of this music.

1706
01:36:18.830 --> 01:36:22.540
Twitter knew a comedian named Leanne Lewis.
She,
she,

1707
01:36:22.550 --> 01:36:25.970
she did this whole thing though for this hope field.
She did this whole thing,

1708
01:36:25.971 --> 01:36:29.960
I guess it's like a place I get horses that are sick and stuff like that and

1709
01:36:29.961 --> 01:36:34.170
they have like 200 horses and this place is about to close because there was

1710
01:36:34.190 --> 01:36:37.220
bankrupt.
And so all these horses are just going to get euthanized.

1711
01:36:37.700 --> 01:36:41.770
And so that's why she's,
she,
she did this party to raise money for it.
And uh,

1712
01:36:42.300 --> 01:36:47.010
so here's,
I think I retweeted something about that.
Here's so suddenly,
you know.

1713
01:36:48.280 --> 01:36:51.620
But yeah,
it was cool.
There was a lot of interesting people at the,

1714
01:36:51.980 --> 01:36:54.770
just looks like a real woman.
Brian,
you might want to stay away from her.
Oh,
she,

1715
01:36:54.830 --> 01:36:58.430
she was,
what's your girlfriend do you said earlier?
She and the adult industry.

1716
01:36:58.490 --> 01:37:03.050
Yeah.
She's uh,
she's what?
Penthouse pet.
Oh,
okay.
Veronica Ricci.

1717
01:37:03.350 --> 01:37:07.750
She does those girl and girl.
Girl.
Girl video.
Oh,
that's it.
Yeah.

1718
01:37:08.500 --> 01:37:09.560
They get them in the dark side.

1719
01:37:10.330 --> 01:37:15.330
That how they come in and they get stuck in word doc of videos and then take

1720
01:37:15.500 --> 01:37:19.690
action videos with your boyfriend.
Why she both?
Huh?
Yeah.
Well she,

1721
01:37:19.720 --> 01:37:22.700
she loves doing that kind of that kind of like tie up stuff,

1722
01:37:22.701 --> 01:37:25.840
spanking videos and stuff like that.
Like I,
that's another one like it would,

1723
01:37:25.970 --> 01:37:29.270
there would have been a video of me like spanking her.
So do you guys do that?

1724
01:37:29.271 --> 01:37:32.170
A lot of spanking.
She's fuck no,

1725
01:37:32.210 --> 01:37:36.890
because her butt's always healing and she's always pretty like lotions on it and

1726
01:37:36.891 --> 01:37:41.660
stuff.
I don't want to rehearse it.
Yeah.
When it's outside of work,

1727
01:37:41.661 --> 01:37:45.800
she doesn't like getting spanked at all.
It's like,
God,
what am,
I was like,
no,

1728
01:37:45.801 --> 01:37:49.610
she still likes her.
Butt's always healing or feel bad for it.

1729
01:37:49.611 --> 01:37:50.780
Have you ever seen that?
A black,

1730
01:37:50.781 --> 01:37:53.510
but like two days later it looks like if she keeps on getting in a car accident

1731
01:37:53.511 --> 01:37:57.450
and her,
but really,
yeah,
it's just purple.

1732
01:37:57.451 --> 01:38:00.360
So they just fucking whale it on it.
Hard

1733
01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:07.000
Dude.
And the other girl had to go through that for punishment.

1734
01:38:07.010 --> 01:38:11.790
Shane Finer.
This girl named Jane Fonda,
she,
she's just spanking,

1735
01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:16.440
spanking her with like brushes.
Brushes are the worst,
I guess.

1736
01:38:18.270 --> 01:38:23.030
Who's ringing you?
That's not me.
Dammit.
I thought she got it.

1737
01:38:23.031 --> 01:38:26.830
It was
um,

1738
01:38:27.540 --> 01:38:30.870
talked to Perez Hilton was there and the whole time he's with these two girls

1739
01:38:30.871 --> 01:38:34.530
and this guy and his party and being very,
uh,

1740
01:38:34.590 --> 01:38:39.590
just staring at every buddy and he wasn't very friendly man.

1741
01:38:39.980 --> 01:38:43.050
He's probably got people fucking with him all day,
man.
I know.
I was just came,

1742
01:38:43.060 --> 01:38:46.950
I just said Hi.
You would seem very leaning into the gay bash real quick,

1743
01:38:48.300 --> 01:38:51.960
you know,
you know probably people who fuck with them all day.
Man.

1744
01:38:51.961 --> 01:38:53.100
He's probably in probably,

1745
01:38:53.101 --> 01:38:56.520
he also likes to stare at people and I mean that's what he does is he's kind of

1746
01:38:56.521 --> 01:39:01.430
a voyeur podcast guy,
right?
Show Perez Hilton knows that guy for the his website.

1747
01:39:01.431 --> 01:39:04.980
He's going to be huge or not podcast.
Yeah.
Judge website is nice.

1748
01:39:04.981 --> 01:39:08.350
Do you know Ron Ron?
A test?
I think this is his name.
He's,
I bet.

1749
01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:12.020
I bet guys would have been nice if he knew who you were for you.

1750
01:39:12.150 --> 01:39:16.950
You got a chance to talk to him among someone who you knew or he knew,
you know,

1751
01:39:16.951 --> 01:39:20.510
so he can see you were green lit or otherwise you're just some weird guy.

1752
01:39:20.510 --> 01:39:24.780
Hey Prez.
Hey,
how are ya?
You gotta be,

1753
01:39:24.781 --> 01:39:27.330
you gotta be glad handed into somebody's.
The pivot was a nice guy.

1754
01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:30.720
Heaven was awesome and I feel like me,

1755
01:39:30.721 --> 01:39:33.990
you and pivot all look like we're related.
Sometimes Callan,

1756
01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:38.010
Callan counts as good buddy.
That's how I know it was weird talking to,

1757
01:39:38.011 --> 01:39:40.350
I have this picture of him in,
it looks just like we're brothers.

1758
01:39:40.351 --> 01:39:44.430
It's kind of creepy.
Did you take it home and mountain?
Uh,
yeah.

1759
01:39:44.431 --> 01:39:47.700
It's framed and then just close your eyes and a wish.
Wish.

1760
01:39:47.730 --> 01:39:50.670
Wish she was my brother.
I think pivoting is super nice.

1761
01:39:51.090 --> 01:39:54.090
He's one of those guys that played such horrible characters all the time that

1762
01:39:54.091 --> 01:39:57.690
you think he's just going to be an asshole.
But he's,
he's so nice.
Well,
you know,

1763
01:39:57.691 --> 01:40:02.400
I mean,
I'm sure he's a mercurial character.
Is he like as a character?

1764
01:40:03.050 --> 01:40:07.680
I just very,
very nice.
Just a nice normal guy.
Oh,

1765
01:40:07.740 --> 01:40:12.000
it says low battery.
10% of battery male.
Yeah.
I see.

1766
01:40:13.770 --> 01:40:15.910
You're both dressed.
Oh yeah,
the same.

1767
01:40:15.940 --> 01:40:20.040
We don't give people my phone cause I black cock reasons.
Oh it was a what?

1768
01:40:20.680 --> 01:40:23.460
Prank pranks.
There's a prank that all of these comics play.

1769
01:40:23.461 --> 01:40:25.140
They always grab their phone like,
Oh let me see that picture.

1770
01:40:25.141 --> 01:40:25.831
And then they prank.

1771
01:40:25.831 --> 01:40:28.880
I love black cock on Twitter real quick when they're looking at the picture and

1772
01:40:28.990 --> 01:40:32.010
make it look like they're using your phone to look at a picture.

1773
01:40:32.011 --> 01:40:33.710
But somebody did that once where they like,

1774
01:40:34.110 --> 01:40:37.140
they came into my house and they went on my computer and posted something on

1775
01:40:37.141 --> 01:40:40.100
Facebook and,
and it's just like,
you know that's actually a,

1776
01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:43.470
I think that was like a privacy thing.
You just broke like a privacy law.

1777
01:40:43.471 --> 01:40:46.650
I think that might be illegal.
Is it illegal to someone to just come in and just,

1778
01:40:46.670 --> 01:40:48.810
yeah,
use a computer really.

1779
01:40:49.500 --> 01:40:54.040
And your mom follows you on Facebook and she's reading.
Why do people,

1780
01:40:54.041 --> 01:40:57.160
I keep on talking to people that let their mom on their Facebook page.

1781
01:40:57.161 --> 01:41:00.490
Why don't you make a fake Facebook page for your parents and family?

1782
01:41:00.491 --> 01:41:04.390
Like I do and I think everyone should do well because it then at some point you

1783
01:41:04.391 --> 01:41:07.270
can,
I mean I have one that's not my real name,
but it just isn't as fun.

1784
01:41:07.300 --> 01:41:08.740
People don't compliment me all the time.

1785
01:41:10.150 --> 01:41:13.960
There's a friend of mine that I photo shopped his face on balls a long time ago.

1786
01:41:13.961 --> 01:41:16.990
This was my space,
not Facebook and like it was just his face.

1787
01:41:17.040 --> 01:41:20.280
It like I made it so like his face matched into the balls.

1788
01:41:20.290 --> 01:41:22.080
It looked like just balls with his face on it.

1789
01:41:22.081 --> 01:41:24.930
It was kind of cool and a video that I sent you the yeah,

1790
01:41:24.940 --> 01:41:28.960
it wouldn't open up for me.
I was on my phone that when I checked it.
But yeah,

1791
01:41:28.961 --> 01:41:30.710
I was going to,
I'll tell you that.
But uh,

1792
01:41:30.760 --> 01:41:35.110
so I put it on his myspace page as a joke and he got really pissed off.
They do.

1793
01:41:35.111 --> 01:41:36.790
My Grandmother fucking saw that.
Yeah.

1794
01:41:36.970 --> 01:41:40.450
<v 2>Photo.
What the fuck is your grandmother doing on mice?</v>

1795
01:41:40.580 --> 01:41:44.030
Your mind space when we make sure that you're okay Sonny.

1796
01:41:44.031 --> 01:41:48.590
I know there's a lot of band influenced
and they look,

1797
01:41:48.591 --> 01:41:50.210
they like everything that you post,

1798
01:41:50.940 --> 01:41:54.120
<v 0>ms legs,
my status updates,
what's wrong?</v>

1799
01:41:54.570 --> 01:41:58.380
My mom will mow right things.
It's hilarious.
She writes,
she knew your Facebook?

1800
01:41:58.590 --> 01:42:02.250
No,
no,
no.
On her own little wall.
Yeah.
When that little friends,
we'll chime in.

1801
01:42:02.810 --> 01:42:05.060
<v 2>What's going on with this country?</v>

1802
01:42:07.790 --> 01:42:12.790
That's the full quote is no like there's no thought and need that it's like I'm

1803
01:42:12.890 --> 01:42:17.690
not comfortable.
Why?
It doesn't seem good.

1804
01:42:17.810 --> 01:42:20.780
I don't think they know.
They also,
they think they're just having a

1805
01:42:21.090 --> 01:42:22.430
<v 0>station with like one person.</v>

1806
01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:26.030
They don't understand that everybody is sees everything.
Yeah,

1807
01:42:26.031 --> 01:42:30.140
but I mean she only has a few friends on her Facebook.
I'm going to not like,

1808
01:42:30.240 --> 01:42:33.090
he's got thousands and should not a comedian,
you know?
It's just,

1809
01:42:33.120 --> 01:42:38.120
most of it is like that's how they keep up with family members and tag pictures

1810
01:42:38.421 --> 01:42:42.620
and stuff.
Family,
family.
People love Facebook because it's so sort of,

1811
01:42:42.680 --> 01:42:46.340
it's all integrated in a way that myspace never is.
My space is just,

1812
01:42:46.341 --> 01:42:48.560
everybody has their own websites and there's a comments.

1813
01:42:48.780 --> 01:42:53.280
The stream of information,
like Bobby just updated his blog post.
Oh,

1814
01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:57.830
Debbie just posted a picture and you know when they do that then everybody feels

1815
01:42:57.831 --> 01:43:00.410
like they're,
they're moving together.
I like Instagram.

1816
01:43:00.411 --> 01:43:02.960
That's my new favorite thing.
What's that?
It's just pictures.

1817
01:43:02.961 --> 01:43:06.500
It's like posting statuses but just pictures so you don't feel like it to be

1818
01:43:06.501 --> 01:43:08.450
funny all the time.
That a long time ago,

1819
01:43:08.900 --> 01:43:10.730
<v 5>text America,
it's frag mob.</v>

1820
01:43:12.310 --> 01:43:16.310
It's my fake Facebook page for my mom and my parents and my family and stuff.

1821
01:43:16.311 --> 01:43:18.440
Like I'll just purposely like I'll be sitting there and I'm like,

1822
01:43:18.470 --> 01:43:21.740
oh look a rose and I'll take a photo of it and then I'll post that kind of shit

1823
01:43:21.770 --> 01:43:26.600
on my Facebook.
Like,
look,
I rose was living a lie.
Yeah.

1824
01:43:26.690 --> 01:43:27.590
It's like a huge,

1825
01:43:28.010 --> 01:43:31.100
like I'm just this pure guy that's taken photos of puppies and stuff like that.

1826
01:43:32.660 --> 01:43:35.810
<v 0>How many people have a bunch of different aliases online?</v>

1827
01:43:36.380 --> 01:43:40.550
That's what gets rid of that because one of the guys from our a message board

1828
01:43:40.551 --> 01:43:43.640
was worried that his wife was a on a cougar website.

1829
01:43:43.870 --> 01:43:46.790
It turns out they like just ganged her pictures for somewhere.

1830
01:43:48.490 --> 01:43:51.980
<v 5>Yeah.
I wonder how often that happens.
It happens a lot.
Maltipoo I</v>

1831
01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:54.980
<v 1>met him up in Canada,
but it was really fascinating because,
you know,</v>

1832
01:43:55.070 --> 01:43:58.400
he was kind of joking around and I'm pretty sure he's happily married and

1833
01:43:58.401 --> 01:44:00.110
everything's good,
everything like that.
But he's like,
well,

1834
01:44:00.350 --> 01:44:01.850
either one of two things is going on.

1835
01:44:01.940 --> 01:44:06.920
Either my wife is really on fucking cougar life.com or whatever website it was.

1836
01:44:07.130 --> 01:44:11.450
Or I'm getting a fucking divorce,
you know,
like how could you imagine it?

1837
01:44:11.610 --> 01:44:14.450
Why should they Madison?
Well that's what is that?
It's the same thing,

1838
01:44:14.451 --> 01:44:17.590
but Ashley Madison is like the one where it's like set up for cheating,
right?

1839
01:44:17.591 --> 01:44:20.780
Yeah.
So he's just,
just,
everybody gets together and go,

1840
01:44:20.781 --> 01:44:24.260
I'm going to be Jason Bourne and you'd be fucking Tonya Harding and let's do

1841
01:44:24.261 --> 01:44:27.080
this.
I heard it's turn interviewing that guy.
And it was like,

1842
01:44:27.081 --> 01:44:29.800
so what do people do that they go under fake names now?
They just put their,

1843
01:44:29.801 --> 01:44:33.500
I mean,
I didn't,
yeah,
they must do aliases.
Like so popular.

1844
01:44:33.501 --> 01:44:36.860
I mean he was giving us statistics and it's all people cheating.

1845
01:44:37.610 --> 01:44:41.070
Well really it's all people that are down to fuck is what it is.
Right?

1846
01:44:41.370 --> 01:44:42.203
No questions asked.

1847
01:44:42.920 --> 01:44:46.820
Get a fake ring and pretend you're married and so he can just be a swinger and

1848
01:44:46.821 --> 01:44:49.820
just go in there and let these girls know there's no commitment here and just

1849
01:44:49.821 --> 01:44:50.700
bang it out real quick.

1850
01:44:50.701 --> 01:44:54.110
That unfortunately I bet there's way more guys than girls and there's like seven

1851
01:44:54.111 --> 01:44:57.280
girls that keep on getting reused by the hundred [inaudible].

1852
01:44:57.281 --> 01:45:00.120
There was a lot less long as you get yours happy.

1853
01:45:00.230 --> 01:45:03.200
It took over for craigslist because craigslist stopped being,
it's cracked.

1854
01:45:03.201 --> 01:45:06.290
Let's kind of straighten itself out.
Turn itself away from all the sex stuff.

1855
01:45:06.770 --> 01:45:10.140
Really what the fuck is that?
Well,

1856
01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:12.320
if they don't want to get in trouble for prostitution,

1857
01:45:12.321 --> 01:45:16.400
there's probably kind of liabilities that they can be like torn so tired of this

1858
01:45:16.401 --> 01:45:20.300
nanny state we're living in.
As I become a a middle aged man,

1859
01:45:20.301 --> 01:45:22.730
I mean I'm essentially a middle aged man.
I'm 44 years old.

1860
01:45:22.731 --> 01:45:26.480
How many people lived over 88 you know,
I'm probably way past the middle,
right?

1861
01:45:26.600 --> 01:45:30.440
This is at a certain point in time,
we just want to go.
Just shut the fuck up.

1862
01:45:30.441 --> 01:45:34.520
This is stupid.
We have too many God damn laws.
It's really that simple.

1863
01:45:34.860 --> 01:45:37.820
You can't regulate craigslist.
Jesus Christ.
He can't regulate.

1864
01:45:38.210 --> 01:45:42.800
If a girl has an ad and she says,
listen,
I need money.

1865
01:45:42.830 --> 01:45:47.720
You need a blow job,
what the fuck,
man,
that's,
that's a legitimate exchange.

1866
01:45:47.750 --> 01:45:50.720
That's what that is.
I mean,
why?
Why is there anything wrong with that?
Yeah.

1867
01:45:50.850 --> 01:45:52.880
I wouldn't encourage it.
I wouldn't want my kids to do it,

1868
01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:54.320
but if she wants to do it,

1869
01:45:54.470 --> 01:45:57.770
if she knows that she can go suck some guys deck and make 500 bucks or whatever

1870
01:45:57.771 --> 01:46:01.460
the hell it is,
why not?
Why?
Why do you care?

1871
01:46:01.550 --> 01:46:03.050
It's okay if she does it for free.

1872
01:46:03.320 --> 01:46:05.480
She could go over to the guy's house and knock on doors.

1873
01:46:05.540 --> 01:46:08.150
She could put on craigslist,
I'm here to fuck you for free.

1874
01:46:08.570 --> 01:46:12.220
Who wants to fuck if you could do that.
No problem.
And no one has a problem with,

1875
01:46:12.260 --> 01:46:16.190
it's just the exchanging of money.
Even if she put it on her taxes,

1876
01:46:16.670 --> 01:46:19.940
I suck this guy's Dick.
He gave me 500 bucks.
Uncle Sam,
here's your,

1877
01:46:19.941 --> 01:46:24.600
here's your buck 50 and we're good.
Right?
That would like to see a tax form.
Yeah.

1878
01:46:25.730 --> 01:46:30.650
All Day.
All Day or all day?
Yeah.
Why?
Um,
why,

1879
01:46:30.710 --> 01:46:34.070
why is that a problem man?
It's amazing.
It's amazing that that's a problem.

1880
01:46:34.160 --> 01:46:37.700
You know,
in other countries it's not an issue at all.
In Australia.

1881
01:46:37.701 --> 01:46:41.120
We were in Sydney and a,
the fucking cab driver's telling us,
I said,

1882
01:46:41.121 --> 01:46:45.170
you guys want to get some pussy right down the street.
Might there's a nice,
nice,

1883
01:46:45.610 --> 01:46:50.310
it's okay.
I don't know.
There's like an area where you go,
hmm.
I obviously

1884
01:46:50.310 --> 01:46:50.731
<v 5>didn't go,</v>

1885
01:46:50.731 --> 01:46:54.320
but there's a whole area where you can go and there's whorehouses there.

1886
01:46:54.470 --> 01:46:57.720
We have time.
It's no big deal.
We had from high times,
uh,

1887
01:46:57.721 --> 01:47:00.060
this girl named Sarah Hash Newton,

1888
01:47:00.130 --> 01:47:05.010
I and she hash Hash is her name Hash Newton.
Is that a real name?

1889
01:47:05.580 --> 01:47:10.080
I think the Hashtag Hashtag maybe that's like our favorite cook that the hash of

1890
01:47:10.100 --> 01:47:15.090
a fig Newton a dash no hash come up now that's over the top.

1891
01:47:15.570 --> 01:47:19.940
But I call myself Joe Comedy Rogan.
She saw him show comedy.

1892
01:47:20.070 --> 01:47:20.881
She's so hot,

1893
01:47:20.881 --> 01:47:24.150
but it's like high times is like penthouse pet and he's like their version of,

1894
01:47:24.270 --> 01:47:28.410
but she was talking about how there was a picture.
Yeah,
I can get her ready.

1895
01:47:28.411 --> 01:47:31.950
Sarah,
her name,
she's on Twitter.
Sarah Hash Newton.
All one word.

1896
01:47:32.010 --> 01:47:36.300
[inaudible] are in her underwear or something.
Scanty I could find you something.

1897
01:47:36.330 --> 01:47:39.900
Definitely scantily clad.
Like right now you say you're on this podcast.

1898
01:47:39.901 --> 01:47:43.320
People are now checking out her page.
Probably.
Yeah,
of course.
Oh Dude.

1899
01:47:43.321 --> 01:47:47.190
We crashed websites like a motherfucker on this podcast when we had Graham

1900
01:47:47.190 --> 01:47:47.210
Hancock.

1901
01:47:47.210 --> 01:47:47.740
<v 1>God,</v>

1902
01:47:47.740 --> 01:47:51.440
you know Graham Hancock is this a world famous explorer who's written all these

1903
01:47:51.441 --> 01:47:54.940
books about ancient civilizations and really fascinating guy.

1904
01:47:54.941 --> 01:47:59.000
He's also written a bunch of books on psychedelic drugs or one rather really
bad.

1905
01:47:59.150 --> 01:48:01.580
Duncan told me about this guy.
Um,
and yeah,

1906
01:48:01.581 --> 01:48:04.700
Dunkin did the podcast with me and we just crushed this website.

1907
01:48:04.701 --> 01:48:05.660
I couldn't get to anything.

1908
01:48:05.661 --> 01:48:09.200
He was trying to show me some structures that they found outside of Japan.

1909
01:48:09.380 --> 01:48:10.680
Some amazing stuff there.

1910
01:48:10.681 --> 01:48:14.720
Like shows that there was a complex civilization that lived there 14,000 years

1911
01:48:14.721 --> 01:48:18.700
ago,
which is according to archaeologists,
it's like before people,

1912
01:48:18.701 --> 01:48:20.690
I mean people were like hunter gatherers back then.

1913
01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:22.680
<v 5>That's like the guy that,
I love that this guy,</v>

1914
01:48:22.681 --> 01:48:26.940
this British guy that was like lost in the Amazon,
they never found his body.

1915
01:48:26.941 --> 01:48:31.260
And there's a book that just came out about it in the last,
the Z Z or something,

1916
01:48:31.261 --> 01:48:35.130
but it's a great story,
but it's about,
uh,
this lost civilization.

1917
01:48:35.410 --> 01:48:37.180
<v 1>Well,
the Amazon is filled with them.
You know,</v>

1918
01:48:37.181 --> 01:48:40.360
they're just starting to find all these structures that are hidden underneath a

1919
01:48:40.361 --> 01:48:41.410
jungle in the Amazon.

1920
01:48:41.620 --> 01:48:46.620
They say that in between the Mayan civilizations and the Incas and the old macs,

1921
01:48:47.260 --> 01:48:52.090
there are thousands and thousands of undiscovered temples that are all

1922
01:48:52.091 --> 01:48:57.091
throughout Mexico and South America that they really have no idea how many of

1923
01:48:57.701 --> 01:49:00.100
these things have just not been discovered.

1924
01:49:00.101 --> 01:49:03.130
Were civilization just the plants just grew over them.

1925
01:49:03.910 --> 01:49:07.450
It seems like it'd be so easy to find out Google.
Yeah,
I think so.

1926
01:49:07.510 --> 01:49:09.880
You think she'd have that mapped out?
Yeah,
I mean,
some of them.

1927
01:49:09.881 --> 01:49:13.450
I looked at this one temple did the excavated in Mexico and it's fucking

1928
01:49:13.451 --> 01:49:14.290
incredible.

1929
01:49:14.410 --> 01:49:18.850
They had pictures of it before they ask evaded it and it looked like just a
hill.

1930
01:49:18.970 --> 01:49:23.050
It was like a hill and it literally had been completely covered in dirt for the

1931
01:49:23.080 --> 01:49:27.460
how many thousands and thousands of years it took to do that,
you know?
I mean,

1932
01:49:27.670 --> 01:49:28.331
who knows?

1933
01:49:28.331 --> 01:49:31.360
Who knows how long it takes for something to be covered in dirt naturally.

1934
01:49:31.630 --> 01:49:34.210
But there was no,
no sign whatsoever.

1935
01:49:34.211 --> 01:49:39.160
And then they cleared it out and it's fucking amazing.
Just huge Mayan temples.

1936
01:49:39.770 --> 01:49:44.590
<v 5>Damn.
She met you at the 2007 high times a word.
Sarah Hope.
I was friendly.</v>

1937
01:49:44.830 --> 01:49:48.040
It was real quick.
She knows that I'm a dispensary,
that you can get

1938
01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:51.040
<v 0>hand jobs in the back so you get weed in the front and jumps in the back.
Really?</v>

1939
01:49:51.041 --> 01:49:53.770
Yeah.
Where's it at?
I don't know.
I didn't talk to her.

1940
01:49:57.250 --> 01:50:01.420
That's hilarious.
That's hilarious.
Let me just ask you to go to jail.

1941
01:50:01.810 --> 01:50:02.610
That's what it is.

1942
01:50:02.610 --> 01:50:07.120
That is the weed community is infiltrated with the Strip club community decided

1943
01:50:07.121 --> 01:50:10.030
to kill two birds for the price of one or something along those lines.

1944
01:50:10.040 --> 01:50:13.840
Another place that 2:00 AM was connected to a strip club.
Right?
There you go.

1945
01:50:13.841 --> 01:50:16.630
Maybe it's the same guy.
He's branched off to this new hand job operation.

1946
01:50:16.870 --> 01:50:20.200
So what's,
let's get to the point.
What do people want?
Pot,
pot and loads.

1947
01:50:20.201 --> 01:50:21.390
Don't want loads come out to dick.

1948
01:50:21.770 --> 01:50:23.920
We could do that one in the front and the other in the back.

1949
01:50:25.700 --> 01:50:28.570
That's jobs in the back.
Okay.
Yeah.
Some do.

1950
01:50:28.571 --> 01:50:31.900
Some dude's will not cheat on their wives,
but they will go and get jerked off.

1951
01:50:32.620 --> 01:50:35.410
I know a bunch of dudes still go to massage places and get jerked off.

1952
01:50:35.440 --> 01:50:39.580
It's definitely a weird thing where it at it somebody is making you come.

1953
01:50:39.990 --> 01:50:43.660
What's going on?
I mean,
I could see the strip clubs,
the wine strip clubs,

1954
01:50:43.661 --> 01:50:45.070
not really cheating.
You're just sitting there.

1955
01:50:45.071 --> 01:50:47.470
You're not really supposed to grab unless it's a really skanky place.

1956
01:50:47.680 --> 01:50:50.830
So you're just sitting there and they're rubbing on Ya and then you give them

1957
01:50:50.831 --> 01:50:52.960
money and they leave.
It's a gray area,

1958
01:50:52.961 --> 01:50:55.780
but I think you could slide at the point where somebody puts their hands down

1959
01:50:55.781 --> 01:50:59.740
your pants.
It seems like that you're basically,
it shouldn't be really.

1960
01:50:59.741 --> 01:51:03.550
It should be that.
It does is a push.

1961
01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:08.440
That's what it should be.
Everyone's giving you the,
okay.
I mean maybe those guys,

1962
01:51:08.441 --> 01:51:11.590
their wife's like,
Hey,
go get your drug dog.
When you got to do,
well,

1963
01:51:11.591 --> 01:51:16.150
there was a story about a woman in England and her husband and a twisted Dick is

1964
01:51:16.151 --> 01:51:19.300
dick was weird or something wrong with it and it was painful for her.

1965
01:51:19.540 --> 01:51:22.930
The way her vagina was built and the way his dick was built didn't like it.

1966
01:51:22.931 --> 01:51:26.410
So he just went to hookers and she was cool with it.
You know,

1967
01:51:26.440 --> 01:51:28.000
she didn't want sex.
She was good with it.

1968
01:51:28.001 --> 01:51:29.740
She was kind of fat and they just had this done.

1969
01:51:30.100 --> 01:51:34.930
She shut the box down so over was like,
go ahead,
go shoot those loads over time.

1970
01:51:34.931 --> 01:51:38.440
As long as you come back home,
cuddle up with me.
That's it.

1971
01:51:38.441 --> 01:51:41.380
That's interesting to cuddle that in the end,
she just wants the intimacy.

1972
01:51:41.770 --> 01:51:44.680
While some people don't want sucks anymore,
you know,
that is a fact.
I mean,

1973
01:51:44.681 --> 01:51:46.810
there are relationships like that where the man or the woman,

1974
01:51:46.811 --> 01:51:49.060
either one of them has decided they don't want sex anymore.

1975
01:51:49.061 --> 01:51:50.680
It's almost always usually a woman.
Right.

1976
01:51:51.040 --> 01:51:54.940
But then there's a weird ones where the man wants other guys to fuck his wife.

1977
01:51:55.330 --> 01:51:58.300
You know?
There's,
there's a lot of those weird ones.
Yeah,
that's a,

1978
01:51:58.301 --> 01:52:03.160
those are the people that hang out at comedy
or painting it like a picture.

1979
01:52:03.161 --> 01:52:07.300
Like that's all.
Now there's like one week,
maybe it may be if that,
it's just,

1980
01:52:07.301 --> 01:52:08.050
you know what it is.

1981
01:52:08.050 --> 01:52:12.700
Comedy clubs are magnets for people that live,

1982
01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:16.840
you know,
sort of outside the norm of society.
You know,

1983
01:52:16.860 --> 01:52:20.620
they're magnets for people that,
you know,
they're just living in different,

1984
01:52:20.621 --> 01:52:23.100
you know,
they're drinking all the time.
They're going out,
they're partying.

1985
01:52:23.130 --> 01:52:26.290
They're not prudes or not waking up in the morning to get up early to go to

1986
01:52:26.291 --> 01:52:29.800
church.
You know,
they're not,
there's definitely that to a corporate job.

1987
01:52:29.830 --> 01:52:31.860
Does regulars that come through that they're like,
hey this,

1988
01:52:31.861 --> 01:52:35.810
there's the one guy that comes every Saturday.
He gets really loud,
but just,

1989
01:52:35.820 --> 01:52:39.190
he's a regular,
well,
how about the Hollywood regular?
It's like Johnny's App.

1990
01:52:39.520 --> 01:52:42.470
You know,
guys like that guys have become a part of the scene.
You know,

1991
01:52:42.600 --> 01:52:46.460
they're essentially fans that would come almost always by themselves.

1992
01:52:46.490 --> 01:52:48.320
<v 1>Yeah.
Right.
And just come and just,</v>

1993
01:52:48.530 --> 01:52:50.930
I don't think everybody that anybody ever charged him for tickets.
Right.

1994
01:52:50.931 --> 01:52:54.500
He just came and sat down.
It was like he was one of the guys,
you know,

1995
01:52:54.840 --> 01:52:59.420
cause he take no,
no,
no.
Jesus.
Same Way.

1996
01:52:59.450 --> 01:53:01.450
There's one guy that sits down and takes note,

1997
01:53:01.451 --> 01:53:04.070
like he'll write down a joke when he thinks it's funny.
You mean Hollywood?
Jesus,

1998
01:53:04.071 --> 01:53:05.330
the guy who walks with a cross

1999
01:53:06.630 --> 01:53:09.590
<v 7>guided walks around it.
It looks like Jesus because his mom was really religious.</v>

2000
01:53:09.630 --> 01:53:12.300
I think the story is that,
and his mom was really religious and then she died.

2001
01:53:12.301 --> 01:53:14.020
So when she died,
yeah,

2002
01:53:14.100 --> 01:53:18.000
he decided to honor her mom by dressing up as Jesus.

2003
01:53:18.001 --> 01:53:21.240
So he grew his beard out and he looks just like Jesus and he just walks down,

2004
01:53:21.580 --> 01:53:24.090
you know,
throughout Hollywood.
He just hangs out at the comedy store.

2005
01:53:24.091 --> 01:53:27.840
He's in tons of movies and stuff like that.
He's just known for being Hollywood.

2006
01:53:27.841 --> 01:53:29.790
Jesus.
He has like a Twitter and everything.
It's cool.

2007
01:53:30.300 --> 01:53:32.760
<v 1>Wow.
Fuck the real cool guy.</v>

2008
01:53:32.761 --> 01:53:35.400
What you did is so cool though that one of the nicest guys ever.
Yeah,

2009
01:53:35.640 --> 01:53:36.660
it's getting some followers.

2010
01:53:37.160 --> 01:53:39.990
So he just goes to the comedy store and hang things out.
Yeah,

2011
01:53:39.991 --> 01:53:43.860
there's a bunch of guys.
The comedy store is a magnet for crazy people.
The years,

2012
01:53:43.860 --> 01:53:46.710
years that we were there filming stuff and the back.
Oh my God.

2013
01:53:46.930 --> 01:53:50.220
It was like always every day it was like some news gives a phrenic or a

2014
01:53:50.221 --> 01:53:53.880
prostitute wanted to talk about how she got customers.
Remember that prostitute,

2015
01:53:54.060 --> 01:53:56.700
she want to talk to us in depth about,
uh,

2016
01:53:56.730 --> 01:53:59.310
you know how she quit and she didn't mind that we were filming.
It was so weird.

2017
01:53:59.311 --> 01:54:01.740
How often do you go there?
I don't go there at all anymore.

2018
01:54:01.770 --> 01:54:03.780
Or you don't go anywhere now.
I stopped going there a long time ago.

2019
01:54:04.770 --> 01:54:07.220
I haven't been there since the [inaudible].
Oh,
that's,
oh.

2020
01:54:07.290 --> 01:54:10.920
I thought maybe that that was just done and you went back.
No,
no,
no.
They can go.

2021
01:54:10.921 --> 01:54:14.790
Fuck.
Now we could hit that.
Pasadena Ice House in Pasadena is infinitely better.

2022
01:54:14.791 --> 01:54:18.540
It's so much better vibe.
Everybody there is nice.
There's no Tommy,

2023
01:54:18.541 --> 01:54:22.540
there's no douche genus.
There's no people don't appreciate the artists.

2024
01:54:22.541 --> 01:54:24.630
There's no dark overlord.

2025
01:54:24.930 --> 01:54:28.560
It's a completely different sort of a setup and now we all have a man cave.

2026
01:54:28.561 --> 01:54:30.720
We just hang out.
They have the coolest style.

2027
01:54:30.721 --> 01:54:35.580
I love that bat cave and he's seen the podcast,
the room now studio.

2028
01:54:35.581 --> 01:54:38.280
Now Brian set up a whole studio.
That's where you're,
oh yeah.

2029
01:54:38.281 --> 01:54:40.800
You're saying that the place where they used to run out too.
It's awesome.

2030
01:54:40.801 --> 01:54:43.920
We do shows that we do an 85 seat room,
which is awesome.

2031
01:54:43.921 --> 01:54:46.830
It's really intimate and that side room.
Perfect.

2032
01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:51.000
That's the weird little little funky room,
so it's easy to fill.

2033
01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:54.690
We fill it in just for people on Twitter and we all have a good time.

2034
01:54:54.691 --> 01:54:58.200
We hang out,
we do the podcast.
We shoot the shit and you know,

2035
01:54:58.350 --> 01:54:59.340
and when you're doing the podcast,

2036
01:54:59.780 --> 01:55:04.000
you're sort of joking around and cracking on things and it just goes right down

2037
01:55:04.001 --> 01:55:06.920
to the stage just like it's a great warmup.
Yeah.
Like one person gets on stage,

2038
01:55:06.930 --> 01:55:09.990
one pixel gets off and you just switch it off.
Like tomorrow we have Steevo,

2039
01:55:10.140 --> 01:55:13.440
Joey Diaz and his life.
A bunch of friends.

2040
01:55:14.220 --> 01:55:17.840
If you weren't in Portland,
Oregon,
you could come down with us or not.

2041
01:55:17.970 --> 01:55:21.660
That's the 30th Oh,
okay.
What are you doing tomorrow?
Going to San Francisco.

2042
01:55:22.340 --> 01:55:25.740
That's his,
that's his family that's trying to get you in,
Bro.
I want to come out.

2043
01:55:26.260 --> 01:55:28.150
You leaving for Thanksgiving?
Yeah.

2044
01:55:28.570 --> 01:55:31.370
Your family lives in San Francisco and my wife's sister,
San Francisco.

2045
01:55:31.371 --> 01:55:33.370
It's pretty dope.
Yeah.
I can't wait.
It's pretty good fucking,

2046
01:55:33.390 --> 01:55:36.790
it's my first time not going back to Seattle,
like going home.
You know,

2047
01:55:37.140 --> 01:55:40.560
if I was going to live in a city city,
like congested sort of type city,

2048
01:55:40.800 --> 01:55:43.980
San Francisco would be the one.
I would prefer that.
Here you aren't there.

2049
01:55:44.250 --> 01:55:45.540
<v 0>Yeah.
You could live in a house.</v>

2050
01:55:45.570 --> 01:55:47.910
You could be in the city and still live in a house,

2051
01:55:47.970 --> 01:55:49.810
you know it's prayerless parking.

2052
01:55:49.840 --> 01:55:51.780
The weather's decent you to get deal with the winter.

2053
01:55:52.310 --> 01:55:55.670
I mean it's Kinda chilly and foggy,
but you also,

2054
01:55:55.750 --> 01:55:58.530
you have way more um,
culture.

2055
01:55:58.560 --> 01:56:02.820
Then la has people are more interesting.
People seem to be more intelligent,

2056
01:56:03.090 --> 01:56:06.210
less Hollywood types,
less showbiz times.

2057
01:56:06.211 --> 01:56:10.560
There's a vapid nature to la that's really not like anywhere else in the country

2058
01:56:10.590 --> 01:56:12.990
and people are moving there a lot.
I think they're in San Francisco.

2059
01:56:13.650 --> 01:56:16.020
Portland are really big cities to move to.
Yeah.

2060
01:56:16.050 --> 01:56:19.260
I would say I would take San Francisco report lessons just because of the rain

2061
01:56:19.261 --> 01:56:22.380
thing I could,
I love Portland though.
It's sunny here in Portland.
Portland.

2062
01:56:22.381 --> 01:56:26.310
Does it rain like Seattle?
Oh,
it doesn't?
No.
No.
Really?
I don't know man.

2063
01:56:26.311 --> 01:56:30.990
I talked to Sally a bit.
No,
it's still,
it still has,
it's not like living in La.

2064
01:56:30.991 --> 01:56:34.410
It's still has its times,
but,
but it's not as bad as it gets.
Yeah,

2065
01:56:34.650 --> 01:56:38.880
it gets more sun.
How many more days?
10 yeah,
maybe more.

2066
01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:43.830
Maybe 10 maybe 10
okay.
It's not that much.
I'll tell you what though,

2067
01:56:43.831 --> 01:56:47.550
man,
when we were there,
the grass was fucking green.

2068
01:56:47.670 --> 01:56:51.480
It was vibrant and alive.
And you're like,
you see grass in la,

2069
01:56:51.481 --> 01:56:53.640
it's like barely hanging on grass in la.

2070
01:56:53.641 --> 01:56:57.090
It looks like an like an old lady that's got enough rain this year to where

2071
01:56:57.091 --> 01:57:01.740
there is some good grass in places that haven't seen him lately lately,

2072
01:57:01.920 --> 01:57:05.260
but in Seattle and you know in Oregon,

2073
01:57:05.320 --> 01:57:07.800
those sorts of mains and evergreen state God.

2074
01:57:07.801 --> 01:57:12.380
And you see the fucking rivers there and shit.
So gorgeous man.
It's like I would,

2075
01:57:12.440 --> 01:57:15.170
I would,
I don't,
might be willing to take that trade off for the,

2076
01:57:15.171 --> 01:57:16.900
the way they have those rain forests up there.

2077
01:57:17.340 --> 01:57:20.000
The forest are so dense mass and I seem to get out there,

2078
01:57:20.130 --> 01:57:22.490
but there's the forest here too are incredible.
Yeah,

2079
01:57:22.530 --> 01:57:26.040
there's some pretty not that far out of town or going up to big bear.

2080
01:57:26.041 --> 01:57:30.750
It's so close and it feels like you're kinda out dude.
Big Bears.
That shit,

2081
01:57:30.780 --> 01:57:35.480
that whole area.
Lake Arrowhead,
big bear,
all those mountains right down.
You know.

2082
01:57:35.700 --> 01:57:38.760
Um,
I was reading about fucking a Lyme disease man.

2083
01:57:38.940 --> 01:57:43.230
I know Louis Ck had some bit when he was talking about,
um,
uh,

2084
01:57:43.260 --> 01:57:47.970
his wife got bit by a tick and got Lyme disease and they get it from deer.

2085
01:57:48.600 --> 01:57:51.540
And uh,
I forget who the guy was,
some famous guy,

2086
01:57:51.541 --> 01:57:56.460
but he also got Lyme disease and it really FAU hall from Holland notes.
Oh yeah.

2087
01:57:56.461 --> 01:58:00.240
And the Lyme disease really fucked him up,
man.
They didn't catch it in time.

2088
01:58:00.420 --> 01:58:03.930
So a apparently Lyme disease,
if you catch it quick,
you're okay.

2089
01:58:03.960 --> 01:58:06.630
You know they have medicine.
What's the symptoms?
I don't know.

2090
01:58:06.870 --> 01:58:09.980
That's a good question.
But if you're around a lot of places where deer,

2091
01:58:10.370 --> 01:58:14.500
it affects your kidney or something or really fucks you with tiny never

2092
01:58:16.140 --> 01:58:21.010
organ.
Yeah.
Got To kill him,
kill him all.
Don't you worry donors.
Why?
Why,

2093
01:58:21.020 --> 01:58:24.910
why we keep it around techs?
We need to figure out where to eradicate ticks.
Yeah.

2094
01:58:25.010 --> 01:58:28.300
I don't know if there's a way to dirty little cots biting you and giving you

2095
01:58:28.301 --> 01:58:32.100
those small,
hidden,
have you ever had a tick what's,
they'd have to serve?

2096
01:58:32.101 --> 01:58:35.940
Some sort of purpose.
My dog used to have them.
My one of my dogs,

2097
01:58:36.220 --> 01:58:38.400
I had a bunch of texts,
had problems,

2098
01:58:38.460 --> 01:58:40.530
and then we had to put other stuff on his body.

2099
01:58:40.800 --> 01:58:43.780
It's like chemical on his body that doesn't allow ticks to get on them.

2100
01:58:43.990 --> 01:58:46.930
You'd find them in is for like you'd pat them and then you'd find like these in

2101
01:58:46.940 --> 01:58:51.940
gorge spots where like did it be as swollen tick fill with blood and then you

2102
01:58:52.001 --> 01:58:55.210
have to burn it.
You have to burn it to get it off China.
One of the boys got,

2103
01:58:55.211 --> 01:58:59.200
I had one in my inner thigh and leg leader guy like took a match and put it on

2104
01:58:59.201 --> 01:59:03.470
there.
And then of course he had to suck the poison out of the thigh.
He really

2105
01:59:06.330 --> 01:59:09.850
did.
He think of your butthole is behind my ear,
but yeah,
you took a match to it.

2106
01:59:10.600 --> 01:59:13.570
So Nick Dune,
where are you come?
Where are you going in the,
in the future?

2107
01:59:13.600 --> 01:59:18.550
Where can people see ya?
Uh,
San Francisco.
The 29th where yet?
The punchline.

2108
01:59:18.640 --> 01:59:20.950
Nice.
Doing a reason.
Doing the reunion tour.

2109
01:59:21.670 --> 01:59:26.170
Reuniting with myself for three shows.
Portland,
the 30th,
Seattle,

2110
01:59:26.171 --> 01:59:28.750
the first at even where in Portland.
And we're in Seattle,

2111
01:59:28.780 --> 01:59:32.600
helium in Portland on the 30th and then Seattle at theater.

2112
01:59:32.740 --> 01:59:37.240
And so if they go to Nick thune.com where they can find a nickname that to get

2113
01:59:37.280 --> 01:59:40.840
inflammation go down powerful.
We like,

2114
01:59:40.841 --> 01:59:43.870
we should promote like a Brennan Walsh show.
Just to clear my just,

2115
01:59:45.350 --> 01:59:50.290
and let's promote that show I was and wash up a website.
Brendan is,

2116
01:59:50.400 --> 01:59:52.300
uh,
should I should know this.

2117
01:59:54.250 --> 01:59:57.130
He was actually just up and see how yeah,
I can't remember.
You had to.

2118
01:59:57.131 --> 02:00:00.030
Seattle shows can be fun too.
I want to let me going back to my hometown.

2119
02:00:00.040 --> 02:00:03.040
It's the first time in three years you started doing stand up there to do that.

2120
02:00:03.041 --> 02:00:06.280
A comedy underground,
the underground and,
and um,
I didn't play there.

2121
02:00:06.281 --> 02:00:09.130
That was the first time I ever featured was for Tom Rhodes there.
Oh really?

2122
02:00:09.490 --> 02:00:10.323
Oh that's awesome.

2123
02:00:10.390 --> 02:00:13.600
But then there's this place giggles that I kind of start playing that too.

2124
02:00:13.601 --> 02:00:18.160
That was jiggle.
It's silly.
It wasn't a part of Seattle.
It's not there anymore.

2125
02:00:18.580 --> 02:00:20.890
I remember Mitch Hedberg had a great joke about it though,

2126
02:00:20.891 --> 02:00:24.050
that he was like passed along to the local comedians because Mitch used to go

2127
02:00:24.051 --> 02:00:26.020
out there a lot and it was uh,
the guy that,

2128
02:00:26.050 --> 02:00:30.010
the guy that books is place washes his straws.
That's how cheap he has.
What?

2129
02:00:31.030 --> 02:00:33.520
I didn't know,
I could imagine it,

2130
02:00:34.410 --> 02:00:37.930
but he would basically take tickets at the door seat people and then be the

2131
02:00:37.931 --> 02:00:42.740
waiter.
Oh my God.
I mean he ran the whole place.
He was a monster.
Jesus Christ.

2132
02:00:42.760 --> 02:00:46.830
Yeah.
How many people did the seat?
Sometimes he would even host the show to Gog.

2133
02:00:47.350 --> 02:00:49.320
Some guys like to host shows their own club.

2134
02:00:49.600 --> 02:00:53.830
There was a guy in Memphis that insisted on bringing up Joey Diaz.
I'm like,
I'm,

2135
02:00:53.831 --> 02:00:57.880
I'll just go up and bring up Joey and then Joey and bring me up some bar.

2136
02:00:58.260 --> 02:01:01.510
And the guy wanted to go up and like you could tell they get all jazzed up for

2137
02:01:01.511 --> 02:01:05.650
it and the one on stage to fuck,
fuck yeah do.
Julia was mad.

2138
02:01:05.930 --> 02:01:07.750
What the fuck's going on?
How come you're not bringing me up?

2139
02:01:07.810 --> 02:01:09.580
What's this guy bring me up?
Just fucking Momo.

2140
02:01:09.820 --> 02:01:12.850
I wonder how long ago that guy was a comic then?
What point?
He was just like,

2141
02:01:12.851 --> 02:01:17.560
yeah,
just by a club.
It's a lot of them like that in some spot back in Boston.

2142
02:01:17.561 --> 02:01:22.150
A bunch of the guys,
Barry Katz,
Billy Downs and Paul Barclay like two of the,

2143
02:01:22.390 --> 02:01:25.150
one of the biggest agents in two of the,

2144
02:01:25.210 --> 02:01:28.770
one of the biggest managers and two of the biggest booking agents and uh,
uh,

2145
02:01:28.930 --> 02:01:33.010
clubs rather in the,
in the whole area buried.
Yeah,
Barry started,

2146
02:01:33.011 --> 02:01:36.490
I was just standing around buried and bill downs and Paul Barclay,

2147
02:01:36.491 --> 02:01:39.860
they're the guys that owned the comedy connection and then duck and then they

2148
02:01:40.130 --> 02:01:42.920
opened up the comic connection at Faneuil Hall and then they eventually got out

2149
02:01:42.921 --> 02:01:44.030
of the business altogether.

2150
02:01:44.360 --> 02:01:48.540
But they started out as comedians and they were like the number one guys in

2151
02:01:48.590 --> 02:01:53.360
Boston for awhile.
They even books shows outside of their clubs.

2152
02:01:53.390 --> 02:01:57.680
The thing about Boston was like,
you know,
like you go to the comedy store,

2153
02:01:57.740 --> 02:02:00.380
the comic store books,
comic store and that's it.
They have that.

2154
02:02:00.420 --> 02:02:02.600
They don't have a comedy store in Boston,
do they know?

2155
02:02:02.660 --> 02:02:06.110
But the comedy store is comedy store here and they have a comedy store in La

2156
02:02:06.110 --> 02:02:10.940
Jolla.
But the way a lot of clubs work,
like in Boston you would,

2157
02:02:10.970 --> 02:02:13.160
they would have like a bunch of little satellite rooms.

2158
02:02:13.161 --> 02:02:16.360
They would book also because he would call them up and you would say,
you know,

2159
02:02:16.370 --> 02:02:18.830
hey,
you know,
you got anything for me.
And they would say,
hey,

2160
02:02:18.831 --> 02:02:22.850
we got this gig down the Cape,
you know,
it's a Friday night,
it's 150 bucks.

2161
02:02:22.851 --> 02:02:24.020
And the laugh factory does that.

2162
02:02:24.021 --> 02:02:27.950
They have like three or four weekly shows that they kind of book out and bars

2163
02:02:27.951 --> 02:02:29.630
and stuff like that.
That's a smart thing to do.

2164
02:02:29.630 --> 02:02:32.870
And I know one of them is by that fucking guy with the red hair who was from

2165
02:02:32.871 --> 02:02:36.530
Boston.
What the Hell's his name?
Steve Hofstetter.
No,
I don't remember.

2166
02:02:36.680 --> 02:02:40.620
I forgot it.
Uh,
but that,
that style of a,
you know,

2167
02:02:40.640 --> 02:02:43.940
having like comedy nights and,
and,
and bars and stuff like that,

2168
02:02:43.941 --> 02:02:46.400
that's what really builds up a comedy community.

2169
02:02:46.700 --> 02:02:49.520
If there's a bunch of different places where guys can work,
it's fun to go out.

2170
02:02:49.521 --> 02:02:53.390
I mean those,
those shows are always hit or miss.
I mean some of them are awesome.

2171
02:02:53.570 --> 02:02:56.030
Some can be great.
Yeah.
Have a great moment in a room like that.

2172
02:02:56.040 --> 02:02:57.410
As long as they're set up right.

2173
02:02:57.590 --> 02:03:00.500
As long as the sound system is allowing the stages good.

2174
02:03:00.680 --> 02:03:02.990
Those are the two important factors.
Sometimes he'll go like,

2175
02:03:02.991 --> 02:03:07.040
there's like that room down in like a San Diego that I used to do a lot and I

2176
02:03:07.041 --> 02:03:11.000
haven't done it forever but or like moon doggies.
Oh yeah.

2177
02:03:11.001 --> 02:03:13.270
Joey does go down at all.
It's a good entity.
Moon doggies.

2178
02:03:13.280 --> 02:03:14.420
And it was a rough shot.

2179
02:03:14.421 --> 02:03:17.210
I mean they've got like a fireplace in the back and the walls open and people

2180
02:03:17.211 --> 02:03:21.470
are smoking and it's a party.
Someone like me and it's quiet.
Yeah.

2181
02:03:21.471 --> 02:03:24.830
You play your attention when you play music all the time and all your shows.

2182
02:03:24.831 --> 02:03:29.810
Do you do it?
Not the whole show.
No,
but sometimes you do some sets,

2183
02:03:29.840 --> 02:03:33.500
like when you go to a club,
you do some sets with no music at all.
Right?
No,

2184
02:03:33.501 --> 02:03:35.870
I'll around town.
When I planted,
when I plan a la,

2185
02:03:35.871 --> 02:03:37.160
I'll go up to the laugh factory with nothing.

2186
02:03:37.161 --> 02:03:39.950
But if I'm headlining a show on the road at brand new guitar and it's like a

2187
02:03:39.951 --> 02:03:43.370
portion of the show,
there was a time Mitzi shore,

2188
02:03:43.670 --> 02:03:45.100
I forget who it was onstage,

2189
02:03:45.170 --> 02:03:49.880
but there was a guy who was a of music act and he was trying to bring your,

2190
02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:54.350
you're funny,
you're,
you have a music act on top of the funny,

2191
02:03:54.590 --> 02:03:56.770
but the music act isn't a crutch.
You know,

2192
02:03:56.790 --> 02:04:00.830
you're just a good musician that happens to use it in a standup comedy routine.

2193
02:04:01.220 --> 02:04:03.380
But like,
I remember one time I,
uh,
I texted you,

2194
02:04:03.381 --> 02:04:08.381
I was in my car and I was listening to XM comedy was the raw dog comedy,

2195
02:04:09.170 --> 02:04:12.530
whatever it is.
Oh,
Rhonda.
And uh,
this guy was really funny.
I was like,

2196
02:04:12.531 --> 02:04:15.890
who the fuck is this guy?
I'm like,
this guy is really funny.
And it was you.

2197
02:04:16.010 --> 02:04:19.730
Oh really?
Yeah,
it was you.
I'm all right.
I remember you remember I texted you.

2198
02:04:20.030 --> 02:04:23.720
I wonder,
is that after we,
cause we did that.
Remember that Twitter show we did?

2199
02:04:23.750 --> 02:04:27.150
Yes,
yes.
Yeah.
Twice after that.

2200
02:04:27.160 --> 02:04:29.120
You're hanging out with [inaudible] we did it.
Yeah.

2201
02:04:29.121 --> 02:04:34.010
Our Twitter show chocolate rain.
[inaudible]
I forgot about that.

2202
02:04:34.060 --> 02:04:38.960
Yeah,
and crystal.
Leah,
I think it was like,
no,
it was um,

2203
02:04:38.990 --> 02:04:43.830
uh,
Doug Dove,
dove you,
me and there was one other person,
Ben Morrison.

2204
02:04:44.110 --> 02:04:47.130
What?
Yes.
Ben Was the guy who organized it.
Yeah.
Right.

2205
02:04:47.490 --> 02:04:50.460
So the acoustics were so bad.

2206
02:04:50.880 --> 02:04:54.810
Nick was on stage and I'm standing next to the stage.

2207
02:04:54.840 --> 02:04:58.980
I couldn't understand a fucking word.
He was saying echoey.
It was crazy.

2208
02:04:59.460 --> 02:05:03.390
It was set up for band.
What have you been room?
Was that in?
I mean,
that was,

2209
02:05:03.480 --> 02:05:06.960
it was a disco.
It was terrible.
It was some weird place,
downtown number.

2210
02:05:06.961 --> 02:05:11.190
It was like a weird colors in a warehouse where you would buy ecstasy from some

2211
02:05:11.890 --> 02:05:16.770
on a stairwell watching.
And I remember Ben Morrison,
it was like,

2212
02:05:16.771 --> 02:05:19.350
I'm going to go down and do like 10 minutes and then bring you up.
I'm like,
okay.

2213
02:05:19.351 --> 02:05:21.240
And he goes down and it doesn't meant,
and he's like,
all right,

2214
02:05:21.241 --> 02:05:25.440
well this is not working.
Let's bring up the one solid cock after another.

2215
02:05:26.910 --> 02:05:29.730
Each word.
He was saying they were just shoving cock deeper into his mouth.

2216
02:05:29.731 --> 02:05:32.790
He couldn't breathe after a minute.
He was eating shit up there.

2217
02:05:32.820 --> 02:05:35.070
Chocolate rain and I remember we got in trouble for smoking weed.

2218
02:05:35.550 --> 02:05:39.480
We opened up some doors to a balcony and smoke weed and I guess it's set off an

2219
02:05:39.481 --> 02:05:43.380
alarm.
I remember and then some guy came up there.
You guys didn't smoke weed,

2220
02:05:43.700 --> 02:05:45.630
you can't be smoking weed up here can be smoking weed.

2221
02:05:45.800 --> 02:05:48.300
We're in a warehouse and these are made for smoking weed.

2222
02:05:48.600 --> 02:05:49.680
That's what they're supposed to do.

2223
02:05:50.250 --> 02:05:52.200
You're not supposed to have alarms on your balconies.

2224
02:05:52.560 --> 02:05:55.950
Let 'em and smoke weed and privacy.
She's the least.
This is backstage.

2225
02:05:55.951 --> 02:05:56.820
Anything is possible.

2226
02:05:56.821 --> 02:06:00.560
How could you expect me to not be high when I'm doing the talk show?

2227
02:06:00.780 --> 02:06:03.370
Isn't that weird?
That was when it's wet echo bowl.
Twitter was like,
it was,

2228
02:06:03.410 --> 02:06:07.400
it was been out for awhile but just getting popular like that month that you

2229
02:06:07.410 --> 02:06:12.410
guys did that it was like that's when you alerted me to the magic of I Justine.

2230
02:06:12.720 --> 02:06:14.970
I didn't know that there was this girl named,

2231
02:06:14.971 --> 02:06:18.990
I just seen it has like a fucking hundred million youtube followers,
you know,

2232
02:06:18.991 --> 02:06:23.630
and she's got like well over a million and a half it last time I looked a

2233
02:06:23.640 --> 02:06:26.940
Twitter friends too.
Yeah,
she's got some crazy number,
something like that.

2234
02:06:27.240 --> 02:06:28.170
But I mean,
you know,

2235
02:06:28.850 --> 02:06:32.460
she gets online and she does like these little videos and she edits them.

2236
02:06:32.461 --> 02:06:35.010
That's the style of video on Youtube.

2237
02:06:35.130 --> 02:06:39.780
It's like a very short video where it's edited each and you can see the edits.

2238
02:06:39.781 --> 02:06:43.920
They're really clear blocks the head.
Who's got,

2239
02:06:43.980 --> 02:06:46.860
who's buying this stuff?
Not me.
I'll tell you.
Oh,
I'm gonna make it.

2240
02:06:46.861 --> 02:06:49.430
So with that fast information,
yeah,

2241
02:06:49.620 --> 02:06:51.870
but meanwhile it's getting people to pay attention to it.

2242
02:06:51.871 --> 02:06:55.110
I bet that check makes a lot of money because they have youtube ads and shit.

2243
02:06:55.140 --> 02:06:57.160
You know,
she's so hot.
You like her.

2244
02:06:57.620 --> 02:07:00.870
Is she your favorite of those kind of girls here?
Why is your phone,

2245
02:07:00.871 --> 02:07:05.460
whose phone is your phone?
It was not near the Cupola someone.

2246
02:07:05.461 --> 02:07:08.490
It has to be like right near the computer to make that known.
I had a text,

2247
02:07:08.610 --> 02:07:13.040
but that was seven minutes ago.
No,
it's Brian's ban.

2248
02:07:13.070 --> 02:07:16.730
It's that right there.
Yeah.

2249
02:07:16.770 --> 02:07:20.850
Why don't you to shut that bitch off once you get done?
It's doing it again.

2250
02:07:21.290 --> 02:07:25.660
It's not me to tell you what,
why is it,
what is going on?
When,

2251
02:07:25.770 --> 02:07:28.510
when the
car,

2252
02:07:29.400 --> 02:07:32.010
which I'm like driving your car,
right.
Actually turning mine off too.

2253
02:07:32.011 --> 02:07:35.950
It anywhere near a microphone because it's,
it,
it crosses paths with frank,

2254
02:07:36.040 --> 02:07:37.750
the frequency of the,
you know.

2255
02:07:38.660 --> 02:07:38.940
<v 4>Okay.</v>

2256
02:07:38.940 --> 02:07:42.900
<v 5>Your eyes soundboard.
I'm making stuff up.
Your CD one one.</v>

2257
02:07:42.910 --> 02:07:45.390
It's on Amazon thick noon.
Is that what it's called?

2258
02:07:45.391 --> 02:07:48.630
And you can get on Amazon and iTunes.
I actually listened to a couple of tracks.

2259
02:07:48.631 --> 02:07:50.850
I fucking awesome.
Oh,
thank you.
Very good.

2260
02:07:51.110 --> 02:07:55.200
You got voted best of 2010 or something like that.
Yeah,
that's crazy.

2261
02:07:55.201 --> 02:07:56.720
I think that they voted like tennis

2262
02:07:56.870 --> 02:08:00.650
<v 0>best.
Oh,
that's cool.
But uh,</v>

2263
02:08:00.890 --> 02:08:05.480
it was in that group of 10 nice.
Speaking of funny comics,
Jim Norton,

2264
02:08:05.950 --> 02:08:07.130
I read his Twitter.

2265
02:08:07.310 --> 02:08:11.150
He was tweeting the reverend Al Sharpton like over and over and over again.

2266
02:08:11.180 --> 02:08:13.700
It's really fucking flies.
Not,
yeah,
Norton.

2267
02:08:13.701 --> 02:08:16.820
He was like quoting shit that Al Sharpton has said.
He goes,

2268
02:08:16.880 --> 02:08:21.880
white folks was in caves while we was building empires and quotes and a Norton

2269
02:08:22.281 --> 02:08:27.270
goes,
well said,
please play that on your MSNBC show.
L.
O l.

2270
02:08:27.271 --> 02:08:32.050

He's trolling him.
Oh,

2271
02:08:32.100 --> 02:08:36.890
of course he is.
But Norton is awesome.
That is so funny.
I never,
I've never,

2272
02:08:36.891 --> 02:08:38.750
I haven't done that and I can't do it,

2273
02:08:39.150 --> 02:08:41.780
but I love reading people do it like Brendan Walsh does it.

2274
02:08:41.781 --> 02:08:43.610
Sometimes it makes me laugh and then yeah,

Oh yeah.

2288
02:09:30.140 --> 02:09:31.760
I go through it again.

2289
02:09:31.880 --> 02:09:34.910
I get more information from Twitter than fucking anything I've ever done ever.

2290
02:09:35.330 --> 02:09:36.051
All Day.

2291
02:09:36.051 --> 02:09:39.740
I'm just getting all these fucking crazy links that I had about Michael Jackson

2292
02:09:39.741 --> 02:09:42.660
on Twitter.
Me Too.
Yeah.
ADDS to the addiction now.

2293
02:09:42.661 --> 02:09:46.060
It just makes it worse and worse.
Yeah.
Yeah,
it does.
It does.
Uh,

2294
02:09:46.130 --> 02:09:49.310
Matt Taibbi just made a,
an awesome blog post about that.

2295
02:09:49.311 --> 02:09:53.210
A Uc Davis pepper spray incident.
Fuck.

2296
02:09:53.510 --> 02:09:55.550
What do you think is going to happen with this thing?
Nick film,
if you had,

2297
02:09:55.850 --> 02:10:00.490
if you had a call,
a pepper spray,
the whole occupy thing,
this movement,
this,

2298
02:10:00.910 --> 02:10:05.450
there's government takeover momentum that's going on right now.
I'm an optimist.

2299
02:10:05.550 --> 02:10:09.440
My wife is cynical,
so like we will get in conversations like this.
I mean,

2300
02:10:10.030 --> 02:10:13.820
want to get better.
Your wife goes all Alex Jones.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2301
02:10:14.690 --> 02:10:16.070
She takes everything down a notch.

2302
02:10:16.460 --> 02:10:18.050
I mean like we have like our neighbors moving out.

2303
02:10:18.080 --> 02:10:21.200
The guy that lives like not the guy that I had got in trouble with on the

2304
02:10:21.201 --> 02:10:24.920
podcast like you got it lives on the other side of the wall from us.
Right.

2305
02:10:25.070 --> 02:10:25.850
You didn't number three

2306
02:10:25.850 --> 02:10:29.130
<v 5>might as well fuck him too,
right?
She's just exactly,</v>

2307
02:10:30.230 --> 02:10:34.040
he's actually a great DJ,
Dj,
Dj fashion did he?

2308
02:10:34.040 --> 02:10:36.500
<v 0>A bit bit.
She's like,
our next week,</v>

2309
02:10:36.530 --> 02:10:38.780
we're never going to have somebody as good as him again and that's all her,

2310
02:10:38.840 --> 02:10:40.280
you know,
nobody's even looked at it yet,

2311
02:10:40.281 --> 02:10:42.890
but she's already convinced that we're going to have a terrible neighbor.

2312
02:10:42.891 --> 02:10:46.160
This is going to be loud and he's the best it is.
I look at it like,
no,

2313
02:10:46.161 --> 02:10:47.510
we might get so many good.
What?

2314
02:10:47.810 --> 02:10:51.710
Why can't we just hope for that and hope that I have nice neighbors,

2315
02:10:51.711 --> 02:10:54.240
but I've had some issues with the neighbors in the past.
It's a,

2316
02:10:54.241 --> 02:10:56.840
it's a terrible thing,
man.
When you got somebody next to you,
that's it.

2317
02:10:57.240 --> 02:11:00.250
It's right next to him.
It's a very intense relationship.

2318
02:11:00.290 --> 02:11:04.070
I have a friend who's a dogs were poisoned by his neighbor.
Yeah,

2319
02:11:04.220 --> 02:11:07.910
moved to Portland.
It was up there and pull it out and is a dog was just,

2320
02:11:07.911 --> 02:11:10.490
you know,
running around barking every day and you know,

2321
02:11:10.491 --> 02:11:15.491
it was fucking new day for the dog dog and this guy complained and then the dogs

2322
02:11:15.531 --> 02:11:18.400
wound up poisoned.
I mean it's like they did,
he got didn't even drink.

2323
02:11:18.420 --> 02:11:22.960
I get in trouble.
Nope,
they couldn't prove it.
So I didn't do anything.
So I'd put,

2324
02:11:22.990 --> 02:11:24.890
I mean,
come on man,
poison your fucking dog.

2325
02:11:24.891 --> 02:11:27.380
And this is a guy that sleeps in a house,
you know,

2326
02:11:27.381 --> 02:11:30.350
right down the street from you and you have to think about that all the time.

2327
02:11:30.351 --> 02:11:33.740
That this is a guy that's willing to kill your dog,
your loved family member.

2328
02:11:33.860 --> 02:11:37.340
The New York Times had an article about barking dogs and neighbors and how that

2329
02:11:37.341 --> 02:11:39.390
relationship,
um,
affect,
you know,

2330
02:11:39.440 --> 02:11:41.570
the right way to deal with and they give like four different ways.

2331
02:11:41.571 --> 02:11:43.910
It's the right way to do it was pretty interesting because I go through that.

2332
02:11:43.911 --> 02:11:48.740
That was probably my neighbor.
Yeah,
I have,
I have issues like that,
you know,

2333
02:11:48.741 --> 02:11:51.170
but I don't mind when dogs bark.
It doesn't bother me.

2334
02:11:51.170 --> 02:11:54.710
But I don't want my dogs to fuck with other people.

2335
02:11:54.711 --> 02:11:56.360
That's what I'm worried about.
Anything is,

2336
02:11:56.361 --> 02:12:00.890
is there a dozen times that barking affects my dog or my like,
yes.
Like my dog.

2337
02:12:00.891 --> 02:12:03.920
Then it doesn't want to go take a shit where he would have been like 20 more

2338
02:12:03.921 --> 02:12:06.920
seconds,
but then the dog started barking and turn into a thing.
Well,

2339
02:12:06.921 --> 02:12:10.070
some people do leave their dogs out all night and never bring their dog again.

2340
02:12:10.130 --> 02:12:12.790
It's really kind of fucked up.
You'll be out at four o'clock in the morning.

2341
02:12:12.800 --> 02:12:17.330
You hear the dog barking,
constantly barking.
I'm uncomfortable.

2342
02:12:17.720 --> 02:12:18.920
Yeah,
exactly.
What's going on.

2343
02:12:24.330 --> 02:12:25.163
<v 8>Okay.</v>

2344
02:12:25.560 --> 02:12:28.780
<v 0>Yes,
it's terrible.
Imagine,
imagine what they could say.</v>

2345
02:12:28.870 --> 02:12:31.980
Just a roof and a lot of dogs get treated like shit.

2346
02:12:32.580 --> 02:12:35.850
I used to live next to this one lady who had these two dogs that she never

2347
02:12:35.851 --> 02:12:37.860
brought inside.
Even if it was pouring rain.

2348
02:12:37.861 --> 02:12:42.861
These fucking dogs just laid out there and soaked in the rain and my Nigga dog

2349
02:12:43.140 --> 02:12:44.850
gets treated like a prince.
Yeah.

2350
02:12:44.851 --> 02:12:49.050
My dogs have a full acre to run around and Oh my God,
I bought the spot.

2351
02:12:49.051 --> 02:12:50.020
One of the reasons why I bought it.

2352
02:12:50.021 --> 02:12:53.810
It's because there's this huge yard just for the dogs,
you know,
because I,

2353
02:12:53.811 --> 02:12:58.430
I feel terrible.
Okay.
Dot.
I c.
Dot.
I have a,
a one dog as a Shibu.

2354
02:12:58.431 --> 02:13:03.420
He knew bulldog mix and the other one's a mastiff.
Oh Shit.
Huge dog.

2355
02:13:03.510 --> 02:13:05.360
Yeah.
Well,
he's a,
it's called a regency.

2356
02:13:06.350 --> 02:13:09.930
What they are is they're only about 140 pounds as opposed to like 200 pounds.

2357
02:13:09.931 --> 02:13:11.820
But they're,
they're much more agile.

2358
02:13:11.910 --> 02:13:15.810
They use him for like protection dogs and we had his dad on fear factor.

2359
02:13:15.840 --> 02:13:19.650
How old is he?
He's seven.
No,
six.
14 of my dogs.
Wait a minute.

2360
02:13:20.400 --> 02:13:24.420
How old do they live now?
He's only five.
I'm sorry.
He's five.
Um,

2361
02:13:24.600 --> 02:13:26.880
they probably live,
you know,
eight,

2362
02:13:26.881 --> 02:13:30.000
nine years if they're lucky because I have a French bulldog and I don't really

2363
02:13:30.001 --> 02:13:32.130
know their lifespan,
but he's awesome.

2364
02:13:32.250 --> 02:13:35.310
<v 1>Those are great dogs.
Dogs live much longer to really,</v>

2365
02:13:35.311 --> 02:13:37.650
big dogs have a real problem.
They don't live pay me.

2366
02:13:37.770 --> 02:13:41.970
Very rarely do they get to be like 10 or 11 like this really big mastiffs are

2367
02:13:41.971 --> 02:13:45.240
Saint Bernard's or something like that.
I mean it's like really big humans.

2368
02:13:45.241 --> 02:13:48.090
You know you see a guy like wilt Chamberlain,
those guys don't last man.

2369
02:13:48.091 --> 02:13:50.430
They don't live that long.
Big Seven foot dudes.

2370
02:13:50.730 --> 02:13:54.180
It's just that your body just can't,
I've got ahead of me.

2371
02:13:54.810 --> 02:13:57.120
Good luck lease you're thin.

2372
02:13:57.460 --> 02:14:02.130
You know it's healthier if you are taught to be thin when you the real issues

2373
02:14:02.131 --> 02:14:07.131
are with large big people because the amount of blood that your heart has to

2374
02:14:07.681 --> 02:14:11.220
pump through all that tissue to get yeah it becomes like a real issue.

2375
02:14:11.460 --> 02:14:13.800
I'm in the top 5% of height.

2376
02:14:13.830 --> 02:14:17.660
I that went to [inaudible] six four that's the top 5%.
Yeah there's,

2377
02:14:17.760 --> 02:14:19.350
I'm in the top 5% of America.

2378
02:14:19.380 --> 02:14:22.350
Do you think that that's going to be different in like another generation?

2379
02:14:22.351 --> 02:14:25.290
Cause I was just having a conversation with a friend of mine about this cause

2380
02:14:25.291 --> 02:14:29.040
he's a,
his wife has a big,
her brother is like a giant dude.
He's like six,

2381
02:14:29.041 --> 02:14:32.580
six and a,
their kid is fucking huge.
They have a kid,

2382
02:14:32.581 --> 02:14:36.740
it's only like two years old and this kid is giant man.
I mean you pick him up,

2383
02:14:36.750 --> 02:14:38.310
he's like a fucking bowling ball.

2384
02:14:38.311 --> 02:14:42.480
He's got these big ass hands and big feet and he runs into shit and falls down

2385
02:14:42.481 --> 02:14:46.170
and just gets ready.
He's like a tank man.
I mean I have little girls.

2386
02:14:46.171 --> 02:14:49.530
So watching a little girls is like a totally different thing.
It's like a giggly,

2387
02:14:49.531 --> 02:14:52.620
sweet sort of a laughing sort of baby time.

2388
02:14:52.770 --> 02:14:56.340
This motherfuckers running through walls,
I mean he's like a baby juggernaut.

2389
02:14:56.580 --> 02:14:57.121
Like you know,

2390
02:14:57.121 --> 02:15:00.300
you look at babies totally different when you see like a little stout,

2391
02:15:00.301 --> 02:15:04.320
two year old boy just smashed through a box of toys just smashed to him,

2392
02:15:04.321 --> 02:15:07.230
forearms and everything at toys are flying,
you know it.

2393
02:15:07.231 --> 02:15:11.040
I mean this guy is going to be a giant and I wonder with all the hormones in the

2394
02:15:11.041 --> 02:15:14.010
meat and all the fucking shit that people are eating now and all the speculation

2395
02:15:14.011 --> 02:15:17.970
as to why girls are getting their periods at age nine and shit.
Does that happen?

2396
02:15:17.971 --> 02:15:20.790
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
It's way,
way younger than ever before.

2397
02:15:20.791 --> 02:15:22.590
And a lot of people speculate.
It's,
you know,

2398
02:15:22.710 --> 02:15:26.250
from eating processed food that has hormones in it and these hormones stimulate

2399
02:15:26.251 --> 02:15:30.490
our hormones and make us,
uh,
they may make us hit puberty faster,

2400
02:15:30.520 --> 02:15:31.353
make us bigger.

2401
02:15:31.800 --> 02:15:34.260
I wonder what people are going to be like in another generation with all this

2402
02:15:34.261 --> 02:15:36.380
shit.
You know,
I mean it,
it,

2403
02:15:36.450 --> 02:15:40.230
it might just be a normal thing for people to be six foot four,
six foot five.

2404
02:15:40.290 --> 02:15:43.290
I hope it's so you have fun,
don't you?

2405
02:15:43.560 --> 02:15:45.450
Wouldn't you rather be the stand out?

2406
02:15:45.480 --> 02:15:47.040
But then the people that we're going to stand out,

2407
02:15:47.041 --> 02:15:51.100
we'll just be that much taller.
Right.
But then,
you know,
cause it really,

2408
02:15:51.340 --> 02:15:54.360
you don't really never realize it.
Once I see somebody taller than me,

2409
02:15:54.361 --> 02:15:57.990
it blows my mind and I,
that's the only person I can look at because,
well,

2410
02:15:57.991 --> 02:16:01.020
what is it like when you go to like a basketball game?
You see those giant dudes?

2411
02:16:01.060 --> 02:16:03.780
Yeah.
Bit hanging out around Hollywood.
You know,
like at party,

2412
02:16:03.781 --> 02:16:06.150
usually in the tallest guy at a party.
You never go.

2413
02:16:06.151 --> 02:16:08.990
One guy might come into a party that's taller than me and then I can't talk to

2414
02:16:08.991 --> 02:16:12.740
him.
I didn't want to be seen next to him.
Do you guys,

2415
02:16:13.010 --> 02:16:15.010
you have an issue with that?
Yeah cause he,

2416
02:16:15.070 --> 02:16:18.120
it sometimes it's fun to be the tallest person so you get upset if another

2417
02:16:18.121 --> 02:16:21.120
person comes in,
that's all you have,
Sun come on.

2418
02:16:21.880 --> 02:16:23.640
It's when it's just one of those things where you,

2419
02:16:23.970 --> 02:16:26.010
when you talk to people and you look up at him,

2420
02:16:26.011 --> 02:16:28.080
you don't really realize it and then all of a sudden you're looking up at

2421
02:16:28.081 --> 02:16:30.010
somebody.
It's like,
oh my,
well that's

2422
02:16:30.010 --> 02:16:33.430
<v 3>like a weird perspective to me when I find someone shorter than me because I'm</v>

2423
02:16:33.431 --> 02:16:37.360
five,
eight,
you know,
I'm not very tall.
So if I run into someone who's like five,

2424
02:16:37.361 --> 02:16:40.810
five or five for wireless is actually smart,
smarter than me.
That's odd.

2425
02:16:41.280 --> 02:16:44.980
You know like Brad when Brad Williams comes around,
no,
like regular size,

2426
02:16:46.240 --> 02:16:46.771
bad Williams.

2427
02:16:46.771 --> 02:16:50.260
And I had the funniest first run and where he was on stage to the laugh factory

2428
02:16:50.261 --> 02:16:52.210
and it's closed on this great joke where he's like,

2429
02:16:52.870 --> 02:16:54.130
he gets a really great student.

2430
02:16:54.160 --> 02:16:57.670
Like I'm probably standing ovation about like how he can't jerk off unless he's

2431
02:16:57.671 --> 02:17:01.510
sitting down because it's torse.
His arms are like shorter than his torso.

2432
02:17:01.630 --> 02:17:04.510
And that's what,
and so I went up and I said,
the thing about chat is,

2433
02:17:04.511 --> 02:17:08.560
is that he also can't jerk me off unless he's standing up Brad and then no.

2434
02:17:08.560 --> 02:17:12.160
Then he goes from the back of the room.
Fuck you Rick.
Because I said Chad,

2435
02:17:15.240 --> 02:17:19.810
is that guy funny?
Yeah.
He's funny.
He's a boy,
right?

2436
02:17:20.770 --> 02:17:24.400
What's that?
Carl's been,
see his boy.
It doesn't the uh,
oh yeah,
dude,

2437
02:17:24.910 --> 02:17:28.480
I guess I don't even think about that.
I think he was on a show.
Yeah.
Yeah,

2438
02:17:28.481 --> 02:17:32.890
it was on all the time.
I kind of like,
yeah,
like with Chewy is on Chelsea lately.

2439
02:17:33.220 --> 02:17:37.120
Julie,
Julie,
the little guy on Chelsea.
I haven't seen him.

2440
02:17:37.121 --> 02:17:39.730
I thought you were thinking when I hear chew or think a truly from the comedy

2441
02:17:39.731 --> 02:17:40.150
store.

2442
02:17:40.150 --> 02:17:40.983
<v 5>No,
no,
no.</v>

2443
02:17:42.560 --> 02:17:47.500
It's not a big Mexican at all.
Did you hear about the Chewy,

2444
02:17:47.560 --> 02:17:51.570
the guy that was like chewy that I was in Austin Powers?
Yeah.

2445
02:17:54.100 --> 02:17:57.820
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
He didn't murder.
He took part in a gang rape.
No,

2446
02:17:57.850 --> 02:18:02.290
the guy in jail that he was in the murder.
The guy in jail.
Yes.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

2447
02:18:02.650 --> 02:18:02.951
He did.

2448
02:18:02.951 --> 02:18:06.370
He murder the guy in the sky in Austin Powers the Asian guy that played like
the,

2449
02:18:06.420 --> 02:18:08.370
yeah.
Oh yeah.
The Asian Guy,

2450
02:18:08.490 --> 02:18:13.230
<v 1>Austin Powers was a guy named Joseph who was actually a famous for fighting in</v>

2451
02:18:13.231 --> 02:18:15.750
the UFC and getting punched in the balls.

2452
02:18:16.170 --> 02:18:20.130
He fought a dude named Keith Hackney and Keith Hackney got him down in side

2453
02:18:20.131 --> 02:18:22.530
control and Joe Sohn held onto a headlock.

2454
02:18:22.650 --> 02:18:26.250
And Keith Hackney just punched him in the balls over and over and over.

2455
02:18:26.251 --> 02:18:29.700
And Keith Agni can punch man.
So this isn't like a little baby punches.

2456
02:18:29.701 --> 02:18:34.380
He's like furious blast to the Gonads,
you know,
wearing a crushing them,

2457
02:18:34.500 --> 02:18:37.960
wearing a cup or not wearing a cop.
I don't give a fuck.
He's getting punished.

2458
02:18:37.980 --> 02:18:42.390
Where was he wearing a cup?
I believe you was,
but I think still got that.

2459
02:18:42.480 --> 02:18:44.850
It hurts.
Even when a cup on man,
it fucking hurts.

2460
02:18:45.120 --> 02:18:47.460
And this guy just wailing on his balls.

2461
02:18:47.550 --> 02:18:52.080
So that's how he became famous and apparently he got arrested for something else

2462
02:18:52.410 --> 02:18:54.450
and when they ran his DNA,

2463
02:18:54.451 --> 02:18:59.340
it matched up with a rape case that they had from the 1990s where a bunch of

2464
02:18:59.341 --> 02:19:02.640
guys had gang raped this chick and then just like left her for dead.

2465
02:19:03.030 --> 02:19:06.510
And so they're all fucked now.
They're all in jail.

2466
02:19:06.530 --> 02:19:08.520
The the people that did it with him,
I think

2467
02:19:08.550 --> 02:19:12.210
<v 3>that's crazy to me when the,
when DNA comes out and then it changes cases.</v>

2468
02:19:12.340 --> 02:19:14.870
So stuff is getting salt now that would have never been

2469
02:19:15.120 --> 02:19:18.870
<v 1>or the worst is when people you find out they were in jail for nothing</v>

2470
02:19:19.510 --> 02:19:21.970
<v 3>innocent.
You know,
this such sad.</v>

2471
02:19:22.050 --> 02:19:25.320
<v 5>They just opened up that one case that I famous actors with Christopher Walken</v>

2472
02:19:25.321 --> 02:19:28.310
was Natalie Wood.
That's crazy.

2473
02:19:28.330 --> 02:19:30.230
<v 1>Yeah.
You know the Natalie Wood case?
Yeah,</v>

2474
02:19:30.231 --> 02:19:34.610
I've heard about the pilot said that he believes that.
Was it Robert Wagner?
Yeah.

2475
02:19:35.230 --> 02:19:37.910
It wasn't as though it was something about how she,

2476
02:19:39.590 --> 02:19:42.920
some of the pilots that are there,
the guy on the boat,
right said,

2477
02:19:43.070 --> 02:19:46.730
shouldn't we go find her?
And he said,
no,
she'll be fine.
Well,
the,

2478
02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:51.680
whoever the the pilot is or the,
uh,
the,
uh,
not pilot,
captain of the boat,

2479
02:19:51.681 --> 02:19:55.090
the captain,
the boat is now coming out and saying that he is,
uh,

2480
02:19:55.890 --> 02:20:00.290
that he's responsible and that he heard pounding and then it stopped.

2481
02:20:00.560 --> 02:20:03.800
And then the woman was in the water after that.

2482
02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:05.833
I don't know man.

2483
02:20:05.860 --> 02:20:10.860
<v 7>It's just weird now just coming out like he was on NBC like the early morning</v>

2484
02:20:11.831 --> 02:20:13.930
Shit,
like not the today show maybe was the today show.

2485
02:20:14.200 --> 02:20:18.040
And the guy asked him like seven times.
The interview is actually really weird.

2486
02:20:18.220 --> 02:20:20.560
He asked him like seven times,
like,
why now?

2487
02:20:20.561 --> 02:20:24.190
What's different now than it was long time and the guy would not answer the

2488
02:20:24.191 --> 02:20:26.440
question.
And in one point you would just say,
well,

2489
02:20:26.441 --> 02:20:29.240
I said everything in the book that I just told them that,
you know,

2490
02:20:29.241 --> 02:20:32.620
who has a book?
And it was,
it was kind of like selling a book.

2491
02:20:32.650 --> 02:20:36.370
But why are they opening up like,
what is he saying different,
you know,
like it,

2492
02:20:36.380 --> 02:20:40.140
it was a weird interview of you Google a bag somewhere.
I don't know where it,

2493
02:20:40.240 --> 02:20:43.630
<v 1>Natalie would may have struggled for hours before she died.</v>

2494
02:20:43.810 --> 02:20:47.210
And what's with Christopher Walken being involved?
He was hanging out there.
Yeah,

2495
02:20:47.470 --> 02:20:50.740
I dunno.
He had some good coke.
They were on a boat.
This guy.
Wow.

2496
02:20:50.741 --> 02:20:54.810
This guy is selling a really sensationalist book.
She,

2497
02:20:54.820 --> 02:20:57.460
she might have floated alive and dark water for hours.

2498
02:20:57.461 --> 02:21:00.670
Why Robert Wagner allegedly stalled rescue efforts.

2499
02:21:01.690 --> 02:21:06.280
Wow.
This is weird.
Well,
if this is true,
this guy who's the captain,

2500
02:21:06.400 --> 02:21:10.510
that guy should go to jail because you held this information back for all these

2501
02:21:10.510 --> 02:21:14.500
years.
You fuckhead you allow this piece of shit.
If this guy,
if Robert Ragnar,

2502
02:21:14.501 --> 02:21:15.880
well he did kill Natalie Wood.

2503
02:21:16.100 --> 02:21:16.933
<v 7>I don't know the seat.</v>

2504
02:21:17.060 --> 02:21:19.790
I don't know if he's saying anything different than he was back then.

2505
02:21:19.791 --> 02:21:22.190
Now I think there's more to it.
Yeah,
I think he,

2506
02:21:22.220 --> 02:21:25.850
what he's saying is I saying the same shit that I was a long time ago.

2507
02:21:26.090 --> 02:21:28.940
They're just listening now.
You know,
before they didn't,

2508
02:21:29.480 --> 02:21:31.120
whoever wasn't saying was,

2509
02:21:31.410 --> 02:21:33.930
<v 1>well look,
I only seen him now.
He just revealed that would,</v>

2510
02:21:33.931 --> 02:21:38.220
and Wagner had been arguing intensely before she went missing.
Damn.

2511
02:21:38.250 --> 02:21:42.810
Imagine if a batch of Robert why and it just killed her and all these jails.

2512
02:21:42.990 --> 02:21:46.270
No,
he got off.
Oh yeah man.
He went on to do TV show.

2513
02:21:46.350 --> 02:21:49.650
I think they wrote it as suicide.
No.
Well they shoot,
they ruled.

2514
02:21:49.651 --> 02:21:52.500
It was an accident and he went on to do TV shows.

2515
02:21:52.501 --> 02:21:56.310
Could you imagine if it turns out that he really murdered her and then he went

2516
02:21:56.311 --> 02:22:00.190
on to just do all this other shit and he thought it was over and he sees that

2517
02:22:00.191 --> 02:22:01.260
will come out.
He's like,
ah,

2518
02:22:01.280 --> 02:22:05.910
so crazy as this 2011 I'm looking at photos of her and him online,
you know,

2519
02:22:05.970 --> 02:22:10.530
2011 I'm looking at celebrity justice on TMZ and it's like,

2520
02:22:10.531 --> 02:22:14.100
it's coming back to get them.
That's dark shit,
man.
If he really killed her,

2521
02:22:14.580 --> 02:22:19.020
it would be really fascinating to watch that trial and to see his eyes,
to see,

2522
02:22:19.021 --> 02:22:20.320
you know,
to see how much of it,

2523
02:22:20.340 --> 02:22:24.180
the fact that we can do that now we actually watch,
you know,

2524
02:22:24.181 --> 02:22:27.570
what man things and fucking 27 years ago,

2525
02:22:27.780 --> 02:22:32.460
which is what this was from or is that what it was?
It might've been more,
yeah.

2526
02:22:33.720 --> 02:22:37.230
Oh,
prosecutors would have had to file the charges 27 years ago.

2527
02:22:37.740 --> 02:22:41.310
Jesus Christ.
So I don't know when this actually happened.

2528
02:22:41.311 --> 02:22:45.570
The Da says that short of a confession,
they're not going to go after it,
but the,

2529
02:22:45.630 --> 02:22:46.260
um,

2530
02:22:46.260 --> 02:22:50.820
the idea that they get grabbed him and catch him after all these years and put

2531
02:22:50.821 --> 02:22:54.450
him in a trial,
that would be fascinating to see his eyes.

2532
02:22:55.110 --> 02:22:58.380
Do you think even if he did it,
he think even allows himself to remember,

2533
02:22:58.440 --> 02:23:00.090
<v 0>fuck yeah,
he thinks about it every day.</v>

2534
02:23:00.160 --> 02:23:03.060
Do you think so that's his to the plotter lying about it so much.

2535
02:23:03.061 --> 02:23:05.100
He probably believes a little bit in his head.

2536
02:23:05.101 --> 02:23:08.360
He can't quite remember what the truth is or,
you know,
that's what I think.
Yeah.

2537
02:23:08.760 --> 02:23:10.620
30 years ago.
That's what it was.
I mean,

2538
02:23:10.621 --> 02:23:14.540
I can relate with him with what happened with the SNL tweet with Brendan 19.

2539
02:23:15.380 --> 02:23:16.213
Yeah.

2540
02:23:16.340 --> 02:23:20.900
I start believing now that I have this theory about a memory that uh,

2541
02:23:20.940 --> 02:23:22.710
any memory more than seven years old,

2542
02:23:22.711 --> 02:23:27.270
it's very faulty because every cell in the body is replaced every seven years,

2543
02:23:27.630 --> 02:23:28.411
every seven years.

2544
02:23:28.411 --> 02:23:32.760
Every single individual cell in your body is duplicated except for your neurons.

2545
02:23:32.761 --> 02:23:36.450
The neurons you keep for life,
but you were cells rejuvenate every seven years.

2546
02:23:36.750 --> 02:23:39.960
So we don't really know exactly where memory is captain.

2547
02:23:39.961 --> 02:23:43.080
There is some speculation that maybe it's kept in the neurons,

2548
02:23:43.260 --> 02:23:45.120
but if it's not and it's kept in the cells,

2549
02:23:45.330 --> 02:23:48.810
how crazy would it be if your cells just hand down your new self,

2550
02:23:48.811 --> 02:23:52.050
like a bunch of files.
Like here's some stuff we remember,
uh,

2551
02:23:52.150 --> 02:23:55.710
this fucked up when we were kids and you fell on a bike when you're 70 broke

2552
02:23:55.711 --> 02:23:56.610
your arm.
But you know,

2553
02:23:56.611 --> 02:23:59.790
I fell off the monkey bars when I was seven at snapped my arms sideways.

2554
02:23:59.970 --> 02:24:03.510
I have virtually no memory of it.
I know my mom has photos of it.

2555
02:24:03.511 --> 02:24:07.110
And I could see my arm in a cast and I could see a sad look on my face.

2556
02:24:07.111 --> 02:24:10.140
But other than that,
that that memory doesn't exist.

2557
02:24:10.170 --> 02:24:14.880
It only exists if I keep refreshing it,
if I keep adding to us biggest fears.

2558
02:24:14.881 --> 02:24:18.090
When I was younger,
it's not copy and pasting.
Yeah,
mine too.

2559
02:24:18.091 --> 02:24:20.040
And then when it happened,
I was like,
whoa.
You know,

2560
02:24:20.041 --> 02:24:22.050
cause I used to always fall down,
so I broke my leg,

2561
02:24:22.051 --> 02:24:24.720
but I really didn't break my leg.
So then when I said I broke my arm,

2562
02:24:24.721 --> 02:24:26.550
my parents didn't think I broke my arm.

2563
02:24:26.820 --> 02:24:28.800
And then I picked it up and it was a fucking pretzel.

2564
02:24:28.801 --> 02:24:32.460
I mean it was bent at the forearm.
I fell off a monkey bar.

2565
02:24:32.520 --> 02:24:36.870
On one hand I fell off the monkey bars and cut my chin open.
Ooh.
Yeah,

2566
02:24:36.930 --> 02:24:40.980
I did that too.
I've got a bunch of those days.
You didn't do any of that?
No.

2567
02:24:40.981 --> 02:24:44.370
Monkey bars me.
You a little.
What'd you do it just hide.
No,
I did all that.

2568
02:24:44.371 --> 02:24:46.740
I just never got hurt.
Never broke anything.
You never,

2569
02:24:46.741 --> 02:24:50.150
you never pushed it to the limit to limit?
No.

2570
02:24:52.120 --> 02:24:53.700
Take it to the,

2571
02:24:56.400 --> 02:25:00.110
what is it about the 1980s and then it comes in with a voiceover?

2572
02:25:00.150 --> 02:25:03.020
When I play on the monkey bars,
go all the way.

2573
02:25:04.980 --> 02:25:09.720
I go sweaty hands.
All right.

2574
02:25:09.930 --> 02:25:12.420
I think this fucking shows over.
Let's bring this bitch home.

2575
02:25:12.580 --> 02:25:16.620
Thank you Nick Dune for coming on the show.
Me.
Please follow him on Twitter.

2576
02:25:16.650 --> 02:25:20.970
It's his name and I.
C.
K.
E.
T.
H.
U.
N.
E.
He's a fine young man.

2577
02:25:21.090 --> 02:25:23.510
Perhaps you should have a podcast of your own.
Nick's doing.

2578
02:25:23.540 --> 02:25:25.480
Have you considered it?
I have considered it.

2579
02:25:25.630 --> 02:25:28.720
I thought you'd have some kind of always that sort of doing a live talk show.

2580
02:25:28.750 --> 02:25:32.800
Right?
What do you do that at UCB?
Once a month.
It's like a light,

2581
02:25:32.801 --> 02:25:35.860
like a late night next December 8th as a record them.
Yeah.

2582
02:25:35.890 --> 02:25:38.670
We're taping and I'm going to try and sell it eventually as a talk show.
Yeah,

2583
02:25:38.680 --> 02:25:39.820
but for now it's just fun.

2584
02:25:39.821 --> 02:25:43.810
It's a sort of theme to it or theme is I come out as a host as me and then I

2585
02:25:43.811 --> 02:25:46.420
interviewed people from my life,
but it's comedic actors playing.

2586
02:25:46.480 --> 02:25:48.400
So like my first show,
I interviewed the girl,

2587
02:25:48.401 --> 02:25:52.390
I lost my virginity to this girl named Shannon Woodward played her and then I

2588
02:25:52.391 --> 02:25:55.360
interviewed the guy that was like my neighbor football star that was like way

2589
02:25:55.361 --> 02:25:58.870
better than me.
Is this,
um,
and then I just go down or do you like,
yeah,

2590
02:25:58.910 --> 02:26:02.680
we scripted out,
but then we improv it kind of,
you kind of know where to go.

2591
02:26:03.450 --> 02:26:06.900
Oh that's kind of the way it goes is I get taken like this next one's going to

2592
02:26:06.901 --> 02:26:09.250
be my birthday show,
so it's all going to be birthday themed.

2593
02:26:09.760 --> 02:26:13.900
But emotionally I'd go on a roller coaster to the show and like get really down

2594
02:26:14.460 --> 02:26:15.630
because the girl comes out.
Those my,

2595
02:26:15.700 --> 02:26:18.070
that I lost memory you needed to and she doesn't want to be with me anymore.

2596
02:26:18.640 --> 02:26:23.230
But I thought that if you saw that I had a talk show,
things would change.

2597
02:26:23.240 --> 02:26:27.550
And you know,
that's funny.
Have you ever thought about doing a podcast?
Yeah,

2598
02:26:27.551 --> 02:26:28.480
I have.
I just went,
you know,

2599
02:26:28.481 --> 02:26:31.030
there's so many of them that already have so much steam.

2600
02:26:31.690 --> 02:26:35.520
I would want to do something.
It doesn't matter man.
Listen,
just do one.
Do it.

2601
02:26:35.521 --> 02:26:37.120
Good people find it.
It's that simple.

2602
02:26:37.121 --> 02:26:40.390
One thing I'm scared of is the things that I say because like now should be a

2603
02:26:40.400 --> 02:26:43.090
little bit,
you're a little wacky with that.
I don't mean to be,

2604
02:26:43.091 --> 02:26:46.570
and then I get and then it,
you know?
Yeah.
Just part of being a comic,
you know,

2605
02:26:46.571 --> 02:26:49.960
you have unfiltered yeah and back to bite me.
And those,

2606
02:26:49.990 --> 02:26:53.410
those ideas that produce like a big reaction become valuable.

2607
02:26:53.560 --> 02:26:56.680
Your memories of someone doing something fucked up.
Those are valuable.

2608
02:26:57.220 --> 02:27:00.970
And also what you say like about um,
you know,

2609
02:27:00.971 --> 02:27:02.220
like not when you say your hotel room,

2610
02:27:02.230 --> 02:27:04.840
like those are just things I don't think about it.
You should,

2611
02:27:05.470 --> 02:27:06.490
if you're staying in Austin,

2612
02:27:06.491 --> 02:27:09.130
you say what hotel you're on and then somebody gets your fucking hotel room and

2613
02:27:09.131 --> 02:27:12.550
just knocks on it.
Duct tapes,
your face.

2614
02:27:12.551 --> 02:27:15.500
It makes one of those videos when they were going to pay behind 400 bucks or

2615
02:27:15.510 --> 02:27:16.960
like that website crashing.
You know?

2616
02:27:16.961 --> 02:27:19.160
Like if you say something about somebody you mean like again,

2617
02:27:19.230 --> 02:27:22.840
[inaudible] dot com [inaudible] dot com is cool.
That's a good thing.

2618
02:27:22.841 --> 02:27:24.820
That's a good thing,
but what if you say something bad about something,

2619
02:27:24.821 --> 02:27:28.790
an accident.
Oh yeah,
it's true.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
You just have to be careful.
You do.

2620
02:27:29.020 --> 02:27:32.290
You do.
I mean,
right now,
500,000 people are listening to everything.

2621
02:27:32.291 --> 02:27:36.430
You say so many shit.
I wish I could go back on trust like what?
I don't know.

2622
02:27:40.120 --> 02:27:43.540
Anyway,
thank you to the fleshlight for sponsoring the podcast.

2623
02:27:43.541 --> 02:27:47.470

Enter in the and Brogan.

2628
02:27:59.860 --> 02:28:04.860
Get yourself some money off and a on it.com o n n I t,

2629
02:28:05.290 --> 02:28:08.540
makers of Alpha brain new mood,
um,

2630
02:28:08.800 --> 02:28:10.480
and a shroom tech sport.

2631
02:28:10.510 --> 02:28:13.450
And what's really important about this Alpha brain stuff and there's a lot of

2632
02:28:13.451 --> 02:28:16.540
controversy.
One of the most important things is you get your money back free,

2633
02:28:16.570 --> 02:28:20.800
100% money back guarantee.
You don't even have to return the product.
You know,

2634
02:28:20.990 --> 02:28:24.170
if you take it within the,
it's like 30 days or whatever the hell it is,

2635
02:28:24.171 --> 02:28:28.130
or one dose 30 pills,
take it.
You don't like it,
send it back.
Okay.

2636
02:28:28.131 --> 02:28:31.760
You get your money.
It's that simple because,
um,
you don't have it send it back.

2637
02:28:31.761 --> 02:28:35.280
So just take the product.
I'm upset about not to send it back.
Right.

2638
02:28:35.290 --> 02:28:40.100
Did I say send it back,
send it in that you want it,
whatever you don't have.

2639
02:28:40.490 --> 02:28:42.620
I'm not good at commercials.
All right.

2640
02:28:42.650 --> 02:28:45.800
That's why people say why these commercials so long because they're not really

2641
02:28:45.801 --> 02:28:48.170
commercials.
I mean they are,
I have to get some information across,

2642
02:28:48.171 --> 02:28:51.350
but I don't want to say something that sounds completely and totally insincere.

2643
02:28:52.280 --> 02:28:54.590
I've heard those and I don't like him.
I find them offensive.

2644
02:28:54.680 --> 02:28:56.030
You know what else I don't like?
I don't know.

2645
02:28:56.031 --> 02:28:58.850
Like when somebody reads off cue cards,
I don't like it.

2646
02:28:58.880 --> 02:29:00.770
I don't like it when they do it during sporting events.

2647
02:29:00.800 --> 02:29:03.890
I don't like when they do it during presidential speeches to mind.

2648
02:29:04.010 --> 02:29:07.970
I don't mind it SEL or um,
you know,
if you got to look down at your notes,

2649
02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:11.420
look down at your notes,
man.
Be Real with me.
You fuck,
listen,

2650
02:29:13.010 --> 02:29:15.560
go out there and fucking make it happen.
Ladies and Gentlemen,

This is now.

2653

We're going to be at the Ice House for a very special day before thanksgiving.

2654
02:29:28.521 --> 02:29:31.610
Show all my Jesus Christ who's going to be on the show.

2655
02:29:31.611 --> 02:29:36.370
You ask why none other than Joey Coco Diaz,
while none of them.

2656

2662
