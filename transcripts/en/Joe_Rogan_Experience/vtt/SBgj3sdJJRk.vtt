<v 3>We're full of that
user.
That's how it started.</v>

28
00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:09.420
Can you hear me?
Yeah.
Okay.
Can you hear me?
Yeah.

29
00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.360
Just everything's a little off cause we're adjusted for music.

30
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.350
Just want to make sure everything's cool.
Notice we didn't know commercials.

31
00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.860
Fuck it.
What kind of shirt are you wearing today?

32
00:04:19.861 --> 00:04:23.280
Joe is on a chart as podcast sponsored by on a.com.

33
00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.680
Go to [inaudible] dot com get yourself an orangutan.

34
00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.040
Kettlebell does the new ones and they,
uh,

35
00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.660
there's $5 for each one of them goes to a foundation to,
uh,

36
00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.620
to help save orangutans.
Apparently a rank tanks are in trouble.
So,
uh,

37
00:04:37.621 --> 00:04:40.380
we decided that since we're buying these a,
or selling these up,

38
00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:44.590
a primal bells there based on primates,
we'll do some other ones.

39
00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.660
I don't want to tell you what the other things are,

40
00:04:46.661 --> 00:04:48.670
but they're not real life animals.

41
00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.470
But the ones that we're doing right now are all chimps,
gorillas and orangutans.

42
00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.460
Orangutans are in trouble.
And so,
uh,
I guess they are.
I mean,

43
00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:58.930
that's supposedly they're endangered.
Oh,

44
00:04:58.931 --> 00:05:01.660
I thought you meant the kettle bell is in trouble.
No,
no,
no.
They're endangered.

45
00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.273
I mean,

46
00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.030
we still have the 1.5 pooed thing on it and I need to change that after we

47
00:05:07.031 --> 00:05:09.250
talked about it yesterday.
I'm going to call,
I'll worry about that shit today.

48
00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:13.330
It should say at least under it,
it should say a 35 pounds,
50 pounds.

49
00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.330
He said like what the fuck's a poot.
Especially if you're like a little check,

50
00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.870
but you've really liked gorillas and you're looking to get one m two poots that

51
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.210
shit's heavy as fuck.
You don't want me to swinging that around.

52
00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:27.630
Go to on a.com use the code word Rogan and save 10% off any and all supplements

53
00:05:27.971 --> 00:05:29.200
that we're selling.
And again,

54
00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:34.260
$5 off of each orangutan kettle bell goes to help save or rank tents.

55
00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.220
I'm done with saving.
Chimpanzees rang tans.
I'm done with all that.

56
00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.980
I'm going with all of that man.
We're also sponsored by legal zoom.

57
00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.250
Legal Zoom is a website that allows you to do a lot of things you would normally

58
00:05:45.251 --> 00:05:49.690
have to go to a lawyer for and you,
you could do it all from your own computer.

59
00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:54.580
Like Shit,
like,
uh,
incorporate form an LLC.
You can actually get divorced.

60
00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:58.550
We're trying to get uncle creepy divorced through legal zoom.
Ian Mccall,

61
00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:00.290
<v 5>uh,
the MMA fighter was on the show.</v>

62
00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.250
He's trying to get legal zoom to do is divorce.
Um,
I think,

63
00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:08.540
I think they'll down the problem.
You got to do it by yourself.
Essentially.

64
00:06:08.541 --> 00:06:10.980
You've got to go through the process.
Um,
you know,

65
00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:13.790
you have to fill out all the information,
but then once you do that,

66
00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:16.910
if you get scrambled and you're like,
Oh shit,
I'm freaking out.

67
00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.630
I don't think this is legal.
Legal Zoom will hook you up with an attorney.

68
00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.110
They'll connect you with an independent attorney if you need additional
guidance.

69
00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.960
So they want to emphasize at legal.
Zoom is not a law firm,

70
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:31.190
but they provide self-help service at your specific direction.

71
00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.940
Meaning they let you understand and they,

72
00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:38.870
they talk you through the process of creating legal documents like wills or LLCs

73
00:06:38.871 --> 00:06:40.880
or things along those lines.
And even divorces,

74
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:44.300
<v 6>use the codeword Rogan and save yourself some money.
Everlast is here,</v>

75
00:06:44.301 --> 00:06:47.840
Ladies and gentlemen,
my wrong thinking.
Robert Shapiro started that.

76
00:06:47.841 --> 00:06:50.750
Or was he just in early like spokesperson?
Is that true?
I don't know.

77
00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:53.590
Let's look that up.
I don't know.
I don't,
I have this sense.

78
00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.650
This was the early spokesman or he might've started it.
Wow.
Wow.

79
00:06:57.651 --> 00:07:02.420
It was a smart move.
Yeah.
But that's one of those things where you go,
Ooh,
hmm.

80
00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:06.860
Hmm.
Do I want to be a,
do I want to be connected with homeboy?

81
00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:09.440
What is Mark Furhman do these days?

82
00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:13.370
That'd be people don't find out like where people are like that aren't,
you know,

83
00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:17.600
that notorious like people are,
yeah.
Let's see,

84
00:07:17.601 --> 00:07:21.330
it says jumped to legal zoom here.
I guess he had something to do with it.

85
00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:24.200
Shapiro's one of the cofounders of legals

86
00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:30.710
Everlast deep inside the system,
understanding all the behind the scenes.

87
00:07:30.711 --> 00:07:32.590
I just haven't smoked up that part of the brain yet.

88
00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:34.170
Dog and I saw that's a wrong,

89
00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:38.360
there was still a little Shapiro [inaudible] Shapiro knowledge left there

90
00:07:38.361 --> 00:07:40.490
somehow eat some fresh fruits and vegetables.

91
00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:43.110
I still live in like the car chase is going on like oh

92
00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:47.990
I'm living in the nineties brother hit the music.
Hi.
I

93
00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:52.760
<v 5>already did it.
So it was officially started.
Yeah,
it good enough.</v>

94
00:07:52.761 --> 00:07:53.910
We don't need all that music.
Fuck,

95
00:07:53.911 --> 00:07:56.120
we're going to have plenty of music in this podcast but don't really need the

96
00:07:56.121 --> 00:07:58.530
opening song.
Yeah.
That Oj thing is uh,

97
00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:03.200
one of the weirdest times in my life because I was a very young man and I was

98
00:08:03.201 --> 00:08:06.980
still really delusional about the way the world worked.
I really had no idea.

99
00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:12.150
You know,
I didn't know like to the extent of corruption and craziness and the,

100
00:08:12.151 --> 00:08:12.561
the,
the,

101
00:08:12.561 --> 00:08:17.360
the fucking dispute between like when Rodney King happened and I saw like how

102
00:08:17.361 --> 00:08:22.190
strong the hate for polices and the,
the,
the,
the,
the,

103
00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:24.740
the anger that led to the writing.
I was like,

104
00:08:24.741 --> 00:08:28.580
who the fuck saw that come and who thought that I was so delusional?

105
00:08:28.581 --> 00:08:33.560
Like I had such little contact with that world that I had no idea what the

106
00:08:33.561 --> 00:08:37.390
disparity wasn't like Holly's people felt about about the police brutality and

107
00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:37.911
things like that.

108
00:08:37.911 --> 00:08:41.540
And you see that video of them beating the shit out of that dude with sticks and

109
00:08:41.541 --> 00:08:45.630
then they got off and everybody's like,
Whoa,
wait a minute.
You're like,
what?
How,

110
00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:50.750
what's going?
What happened here?
Exactly.
Okay.
He was on what he said he's on,

111
00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:54.110
he's on like angel dust so he doesn't feel it.
Is that what's happening here?

112
00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:56.010
Do they have something that they can,
can they hold on

113
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:59.820
<v 6>to him?
Like he's five guys,
can't they Russell this due to the ground?
Like,</v>

114
00:08:59.821 --> 00:09:02.520
it seems like,
it seems like they having a good time for me,
shit out of this.

115
00:09:02.521 --> 00:09:06.690
The myth of like,
or not the myth,
but the grand thing about deal.
Yeah.
Angel Dust.

116
00:09:06.691 --> 00:09:09.360
That's the one thing they say like,
Yo,
people are broken out of handcuffs.

117
00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:12.630
If that's the case,
people need to revisit that fucking,

118
00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:15.600
that one particular issue because uh,

119
00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:18.600
Angel that I have a friend who had his finger bitten off man.
It wasn't,

120
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:20.970
that was just the straw dude.
You know what I mean?

121
00:09:20.971 --> 00:09:24.480
That was just a straw on the camel's back was it's damn near snapped at that

122
00:09:24.481 --> 00:09:27.240
point.
I was living on that side of the world.
I was like part of the ice,

123
00:09:27.241 --> 00:09:30.330
these riots in the kid I was running through.
It was like,

124
00:09:30.331 --> 00:09:35.070
I knew the hatred for the police was,
was that was like I was,
I was,
you know,

125
00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:39.210
normal.
What was it like rolling around with those guys?

126
00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:42.780
You know what the thing was is like,
in a weird way,

127
00:09:42.781 --> 00:09:45.830
I was just so oblivious to it that I,
you know,
cause I was treated as it,

128
00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:46.081
you know,

129
00:09:46.081 --> 00:09:50.280
like I was a member of the crew was already one of that rap kid and it was like,

130
00:09:50.281 --> 00:09:53.940
you know,
I,
you know,
as long as I showed them,
had the balls to be somewhere,

131
00:09:53.941 --> 00:09:56.880
I felt like I was cool there.
You know?
I mean,
I was like,
I,
and I was,
I never,

132
00:09:56.881 --> 00:10:00.660
I wasn't into gang bang and everything.
I never flag in anywhere.
I was,
you know,

133
00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.090
but,
and I always,
you know,
and I was,
you know,

134
00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:06.720
knew a few key people that would be like,
oh yeah,
like if he knows that dude.

135
00:10:06.721 --> 00:10:09.360
All right too.
That was a huge ice tea fan.

136
00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:12.200
I used to get told like they used by like Castlight guys,

137
00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:14.770
ice would say things like,
you know,
yeah man,
you know,
you're white man.

138
00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:17.700
Everybody here either thinks you're crazy for being here or you're a cop.

139
00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:23.120
So it's good.
You're good.
So two nights,
that was one.
Yeah.
Well,

140
00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.290
you know what,
man has his best shit.
Well,

141
00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:27.960
I think colors is one of his best songs ever.

142
00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:33.220
That is one of the best like theme songs for a movie representative of what was

143
00:10:33.661 --> 00:10:37.560
going on in that movie.
That,
that,
that song just fucking nailed it.

144
00:10:37.561 --> 00:10:39.870
That was right place,
right time,
right dude.
You know what I mean?
Whoever,

145
00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:41.000
whoever picked him for that,

146
00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:43.650
it was the right if everybody made the right decision.

147
00:10:43.651 --> 00:10:45.690
That's the rap version of live and let die.

148
00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:53.000
That's a good thought.
Live and let die.
It's just a theme song for a movie.
Right?

149
00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:57.970
But it's a bad ass fucking song.
I mean,
Dada,
Dada,

150
00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:02.190
this original purpose,
the original purpose,
it was a theme for Homie.

151
00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:06.530
I believe Paul Mccartney made it for the movie.
Unless it was just,
oh no,
I can,

152
00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:11.010
uh,
just a coincidence that he had a song called live and let die and there was a

153
00:11:11.011 --> 00:11:14.310
double o seven movie,
let's say.
Okay,
let's find out.

154
00:11:14.311 --> 00:11:18.300
We need to find Paul Mccartney.
You Fan of Paul Mccartney.

155
00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.930
I mean,
as a songwriter,
how could you not be right?

156
00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:26.870
I mean the guy's written a lot of amazing songs.
You know,
you,

157
00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:32.340
you aspire to write that many well known songs,
you know,
he was a beast,
you know,

158
00:11:32.341 --> 00:11:35.010
I mean I think there's like,
cause you seem like such a nice guy.

159
00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:38.490
I think like some more hardcore people don't give that guy the credit he

160
00:11:38.491 --> 00:11:41.670
deserves.
Like,
like for me,
like if you look at the Beatles,
you break them down.

161
00:11:41.671 --> 00:11:46.320
It's like Paul John Lennon wrote the more ethereal kind of Weirdo kind of songs

162
00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:50.460
or like more government related protest.
He kind of stuff.

163
00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:54.010
Paul Mccartney wrote this stuff about love and life every day.
Things,

164
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:56.530
<v 5>you know what I mean?
And like turning him in the poetry kind of thing.
You know,</v>

165
00:11:56.531 --> 00:11:59.830
that's,
you know,
I think there are,
I love them both in different ways.

166
00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:01.323
Perfectly sad.

167
00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:05.590
He was commissioned specifically for this movie and credited to McCartney.

168
00:12:05.591 --> 00:12:10.540
His wife Linda reunited the former Beatles producer George Martin who bought

169
00:12:10.541 --> 00:12:14.290
produce a song and it brings the orchestra break.
It was all done for,
uh,

170
00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:19.240
for that movie.
This is one of the most successful like movie theme songs ever.

171
00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:23.380
Cause it was a real song.
Yeah.
And then guns and roses,
we cut it and yeah,

172
00:12:23.381 --> 00:12:24.610
so 10 million records.

173
00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:30.580
That's how fucking bad ass song for your theme song,

174
00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:34.350
your movies making $100 million no matter what.
Just what that song on it.
Yeah.

175
00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:38.410
You know it can't go wrong.
And then band on the run,
that's like,

176
00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:42.330
that's a crazy song.
That's like two songs in one.
You know,
like you,

177
00:12:42.331 --> 00:12:43.750
you listen to the beginning of it.

178
00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:48.930
And then when the rain exploded with a mighty crash as we fell into the sun,

179
00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:54.670
God Damn Paul Mccartney.
I mean that's a beautiful fucking song.

180
00:12:54.671 --> 00:12:58.030
It's a work of art and good drugs.
Oh fuck.
Yeah.

181
00:12:58.031 --> 00:12:59.530
He'd seen everything there is to say.

182
00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:04.030
He saw the full month of saw that happened as he,
as he fell into the sun,

183
00:13:04.031 --> 00:13:05.860
he saw that happen.
Well,

184
00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:09.520
rain exploded with a mighty crash as we fell into the sun.

185
00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:15.370
Damn.
You know,
he had to have seen all of that.
That's a mold.

186
00:13:15.371 --> 00:13:18.580
I can hear the colors,
I can hear the creditors,
man.

187
00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:21.390
He can't write something like that unless you've seen something like that.

188
00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:23.080
You can't fake that lyric.

189
00:13:23.081 --> 00:13:26.950
The rain exploded with a mighty crash as we fell into this son.

190
00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:30.340
What the fuck?
The first one to said to the second one there,

191
00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:31.720
I hope you're having fun.

192
00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:36.520
That is psychedelic as a lyric ever can get without being like ponderous.

193
00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:37.511
You know what I mean?

194
00:13:37.511 --> 00:13:41.320
Without being like blatantly obvious or trying to be like trippy like that is

195
00:13:41.321 --> 00:13:43.750
just,
there's,
that's a perfect lyric.

196
00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:48.130
Well the rain exploded with a mighty crash as we fell into the sun and the first

197
00:13:48.131 --> 00:13:50.770
one said to the second one there,
I hope you're having fun.

198
00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:53.640
What kind of Shit are you onsite on?

199
00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:58.900
Acid for real.
It has to be right.

200
00:13:58.901 --> 00:14:02.290
Heavy doses of it.
It's such a trippy lyric.

201
00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:07.060
He was so there that that band was so instrumental in opening people's minds to

202
00:14:07.061 --> 00:14:10.360
the ideas of altered states of consciousness because they were so into like

203
00:14:10.361 --> 00:14:14.590
meditation and you know,
there was always hanging out with weird gurus and shit.

204
00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:16.450
They were freaky dudes,
man.

205
00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:20.890
And they started off like these really sweet guys from England was cute haircuts

206
00:14:20.891 --> 00:14:25.420
making girls scream and then somewhere along may morphed into this like

207
00:14:25.421 --> 00:14:29.080
spiritual injection machine.
You know,

208
00:14:29.081 --> 00:14:31.990
like if you go back to the white album,
like some,
like you,

209
00:14:31.991 --> 00:14:33.550
if you became a fan of the Beatles,

210
00:14:33.551 --> 00:14:38.380
he became a fan of like very strange alternate ways of thinking,
you know?

211
00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:43.430
Yeah.
You saw at this time if you were a fan morphing with them.
Yeah.

212
00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:48.070
You had to be pretty open minded.
Yeah.
You know,

213
00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:51.980
luckily the music was just really good,
so it helped a

214
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:55.670
<v 6>lot.
I think that you had to be that good.</v>

215
00:14:55.671 --> 00:15:00.200
You can say some really,
really stupid shit on a bit of music.
That sounds good.

216
00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.570
I mean,
and that proof is all around us today.

217
00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:07.730
All around us always will be.
But I think to be that good,

218
00:15:07.731 --> 00:15:11.240
you have to get crazy.
And I think they got crazy.
They just went everywhere.

219
00:15:11.241 --> 00:15:15.530
They just went with it.
And there's no way,
you know,
you can't,
it's,

220
00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:18.600
that's not a regular dude.
If I could do is not going to make that song.
It's not,

221
00:15:18.610 --> 00:15:22.450
it's literally not possible.
Like did the mind does not work that way.
If you're,

222
00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:25.820
you got to be some crazy dude out there wearing robes,

223
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.150
hanging out with dudes and Tibet for real.
You don't say tars

224
00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:33.470
and be a perfectionist.
You got to have good roots and shit.

225
00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:37.130
Indian dudes would white beards and they'd tell you freaky shit.

226
00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:42.320
But also the cats didn't have the benefits of computer technology,
man.

227
00:15:42.321 --> 00:15:46.340
They have to be good at all of the shit they were doing.
Yeah,
totally true.
Yeah.

228
00:15:46.341 --> 00:15:49.820
Now I do days a guy could grab this guitar completely that attuned and like

229
00:15:49.821 --> 00:15:52.550
strum it on it a little bit and,
and literally in the,

230
00:15:52.551 --> 00:15:54.830
in the box make it sound like he was doing something.

231
00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:58.670
Do you think that that cheapens music or is it d just give an artist more tools?

232
00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:03.920
Um,
is it obvious?
More cheapens it.
I think it could,
it could do what you do.

233
00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:06.290
You know,
it's a double,
it's a double edged sword.
I mean,
you know,

234
00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:10.500
but when it's just used like to blatantly like suck the light.
Yeah.

235
00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:12.650
We talk about something like,
you know,
like we'll hit,

236
00:16:12.651 --> 00:16:15.830
we'll listen to old records that were like sampled and made into hip hop
records.

237
00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:17.650
Like I don't bite before we go on.
I lacked,

238
00:16:17.651 --> 00:16:19.250
I listen to a lot of old music when we play,

239
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.510
so we'll listen to the old versions of stuff and then we'll put on new versions

240
00:16:23.511 --> 00:16:24.141
and new versions.

241
00:16:24.141 --> 00:16:26.900
Even though they're sampled or using pieces of that old version,

242
00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:29.090
they don't have the grease because it's not alive.

243
00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:34.400
There's not five guys locking up playing it.
It's like a machine.
Here's a piece,

244
00:16:34.401 --> 00:16:36.230
piece piece,
and then we repeat that piece piece piece,

245
00:16:36.231 --> 00:16:37.750
and then we can repeat that piece piece piece.

246
00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:40.880
It's like sucks the life out of things sometimes.
You know what I mean?
It's,

247
00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:42.650
it's good for,
I mean like for club music,

248
00:16:42.651 --> 00:16:47.240
if you're just making like drum machine club music or hip hop,

249
00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:50.300
you know what I mean?
Like,
you know,
it sounds good in clubs,
but it's not,

250
00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:53.970
you know,
it's not really,
it doesn't have no grease.
You know,

251
00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:57.770
the first time I ever saw a rapper in a club was in Mexico.

252
00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:01.520
I saw ludicrous perform in Mexico.
He was like an hour late,

253
00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:04.530
you know like all that's early.
That's early for a rapper.

254
00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:08.120
Everybody's like waiting for the show stuff.
But damn man,
when he,

255
00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:11.660
when he did it and it was like complete short attention span rap,

256
00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:15.970
like you never really finish a rap.
He just went from one wrap to the other,

257
00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:19.880
like shorten,
shorten the songs up.
And I was like,
that's kind of crazy.
I'm like,

258
00:17:19.881 --> 00:17:21.500
how often did they do that?
And my friend was like,

259
00:17:21.501 --> 00:17:24.800
they always do that at hip hop shows and I go,
why?
And he goes,

260
00:17:24.801 --> 00:17:26.790
they just don't want to give anybody any breaks.
No,

261
00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:30.470
no chance to like think that things are calming down and no chance.
Like it just,

262
00:17:30.471 --> 00:17:32.810
just go,
go,
go.
They're like,
it's a different,

263
00:17:32.811 --> 00:17:36.800
it's a different environment than playing a record.
Bless.
You never know when it,

264
00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:39.500
when you play clubs like when it's just all going to go wrong anyways.

265
00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:42.110
You want to get the bulk of your set in so you're,
you know,

266
00:17:42.111 --> 00:17:46.550
you're getting paid well.
Does that the case in like rap shows in general?

267
00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:50.270
Just like,
no,
it's just like that's the energy or the energy of a ramp show is,

268
00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:53.850
it's different than unless,

269
00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:56.880
you know you got rappers and certain cats that use bands now,

270
00:17:56.881 --> 00:17:59.790
but it's like when you go and you see a show that has a band,

271
00:17:59.791 --> 00:18:03.690
there's things to see and watch and wonder about in like,
wow,
wow,

272
00:18:03.691 --> 00:18:06.180
that sound and these guys are all doing crazy thing,
you know?

273
00:18:06.181 --> 00:18:08.430
But when it's like just a Dj and a rapper,

274
00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:11.820
that can get boring real quick just watching it.
So did you did,
yeah,

275
00:18:11.821 --> 00:18:14.980
they just got to hit you in Hitchin when hits you and hits you,
we'd like me.

276
00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:16.860
It's medley time is really what it is.

277
00:18:16.861 --> 00:18:21.720
It's all about the medically in hip hop and plus it's like a ringtone
generation.

278
00:18:21.721 --> 00:18:22.650
So they want to hear,
you know,

279
00:18:22.651 --> 00:18:25.920
most of them only know the song up until the ringtone cuts off.
Wow.

280
00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:31.530
How does that,
what does that say about us?
I'm serious,
but it's true.
Look,

281
00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:34.500
I know you get about a minute and a half or something.

282
00:18:34.501 --> 00:18:36.970
I think when you are a minute of a ringtone,
you know that's,

283
00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:38.830
that's basically what they,
when you,
I,

284
00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:43.320
I occasionally Dj like a Columbia here and there in Vegas when,
you know,
when,

285
00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:46.020
when they throw out a couple of dollars and I say I'm bored enough and it's

286
00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:46.890
because I think it's fun,

287
00:18:46.891 --> 00:18:51.300
but I don't think I ever get out of a first verse of a record.
Well very rarely,

288
00:18:51.301 --> 00:18:54.150
and it's usually a classic like Dr Dre,
you know,

289
00:18:54.151 --> 00:18:58.020
a next episode or something like that or you know,
jump around or,
you know,

290
00:18:58.021 --> 00:18:59.280
and not to toot my horn,

291
00:18:59.281 --> 00:19:01.980
I'm just saying it's usually a classic record like that you can get away with

292
00:19:01.981 --> 00:19:05.100
playing a few verses of,
otherwise it's just like kind of like one hook,

293
00:19:05.101 --> 00:19:08.140
one verse,
one hooked went,
let's get out and get to the next thing for it.

294
00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:10.350
Cause it's,
that's the dance that they want to dance.
They want to move.

295
00:19:10.351 --> 00:19:11.430
They want to just always be like,

296
00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:14.960
oh they always want to be like the next song came on.
Yeah.
Wow.

297
00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:18.420
The party's got to be beginning like every five minutes.
So it's different than,

298
00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:20.610
than doing your songs just in a,

299
00:19:20.611 --> 00:19:23.850
in a live session like you do when you come see me doing acoustic show,

300
00:19:23.851 --> 00:19:27.630
I take my motherfucking sweet time about it,
man.
And I,
and I,
you know,

301
00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:32.660
I might even start mumbling while I drink whiskey and wind up telling a story I

302
00:19:32.701 --> 00:19:36.630
never meant to tell in the first place.
Right.
It's a different thing.

303
00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:38.250
What do you like better?

304
00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:39.790
<v 7>Okay.</v>

305
00:19:39.790 --> 00:19:44.560
<v 6>Um,
rationals are,
and we're fun.
I did plenty of them,
but I enjoy what I do.</v>

306
00:19:44.561 --> 00:19:45.341
I like playing music.

307
00:19:45.341 --> 00:19:48.700
I like locking in with people and other musicians and us creating,

308
00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:51.420
like they play my songs the way they should be played.
But yeah,

309
00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:54.480
if you listen enough,

310
00:19:54.481 --> 00:19:57.900
like think different things happen every night and we're all fitting in with

311
00:19:57.901 --> 00:20:00.780
different,
you know,
without prying,
without changing the song you,

312
00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:04.110
there's things going on that,
um,
you know,
I'll be like,
oh,

313
00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:08.050
I saw what you did right there and oh we are our own or we'll all just black out

314
00:20:08.051 --> 00:20:13.051
and zone in some other place and it's trans transcend transcendental it,

315
00:20:13.901 --> 00:20:16.720
when does that the right word?
Transcendent,
transcendent send it.

316
00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:20.110
I mean you just kind of,
it's the energy of the music.

317
00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:22.410
I liked that a little bit better.
I got,
you know,
hip hop is,

318
00:20:22.411 --> 00:20:27.040
the energy is kind of a one,
it's kind of a steady Masha heavily angry.

319
00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:30.520
Even even when it's like trying to be slowed down and love songs,

320
00:20:30.521 --> 00:20:32.680
they're like heavily angry towards,
towards the women.

321
00:20:32.681 --> 00:20:37.200
They're talking about this as long as my bitches love me,
bitches love me.

322
00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:40.690
It was like,
okay.
I mean I'm sitting here and I'm,

323
00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:43.900
I have that on in the car and I'm like,
oh this is a funny,
cool song.
I like it.

324
00:20:43.901 --> 00:20:44.291
It's cool.

325
00:20:44.291 --> 00:20:48.730
But it's like not think about is like if I were to like that to me like abroad,

326
00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:52.690
as long as my teachers love me and bitches,
I don't know.
Who knows?

327
00:20:52.691 --> 00:20:53.291
Maybe then I went,

328
00:20:53.291 --> 00:20:57.220
sent him sell 10 million records and that should be my next effort.

329
00:20:57.310 --> 00:20:59.320
Maybe just too happy and successful.

330
00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:03.040
Maybe we need to tune into pissed off people that are all,
no fucking,

331
00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:04.150
I'm pretty pissed off.

332
00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:12.230
<v 5>Yeah,
that the aggression of rap music is like,
I mean there's like Noah,</v>

333
00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:16.970
there's never been an art form where people bragged about like killing people

334
00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:20.720
and got killing the police and like you know it was just running around making

335
00:21:20.721 --> 00:21:25.580
millions.
Dogs are a little bit of Johnny Cash Rock Man.

336
00:21:25.581 --> 00:21:28.100
There's some punk rock shit that was pretty out there.
That's true.

337
00:21:28.101 --> 00:21:31.190
Well I was never exposed to that.
I for whatever reason,

338
00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:34.490
never had any desire to listen to any punk rock.
I always,

339
00:21:34.491 --> 00:21:37.910
I mean it's totally prejudice but I always associated everybody who was like a

340
00:21:37.911 --> 00:21:40.970
punk rock lever with like misplaced anger and I was like just,

341
00:21:40.971 --> 00:21:44.130
I don't have time for this.
I got to get away.
Like for real,
I've never lived,

342
00:21:44.131 --> 00:21:47.760
I listened and it's totally ignorant and I completely agree.
I mean like,
uh,

343
00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:52.060
admitted but you never listen to ash or anything like that I guess.

344
00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:54.310
Is that punk rock?
The Casbah is that punk?

345
00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:58.350
There's arguments that that's their most pop stuff,
you know,

346
00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:02.650
I just thought it was great music and once I didn't London calling,
you know,

347
00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:06.410
but had lots of songs like the guns of Brixton and all kinds of stuff about,

348
00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:10.610
you mean what is punk though?
I don't understand it.
I just,

349
00:22:10.611 --> 00:22:14.180
I was associated with people with their hair,
like all spiked up and you know,

350
00:22:14.181 --> 00:22:15.590
looking to stomp around and shit.

351
00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:19.170
<v 6>I feel like punk is like a DIY thing.
Like it's like the sentiment,</v>

352
00:22:19.171 --> 00:22:21.780
you're going to put that out there before you even know how to play.

353
00:22:21.781 --> 00:22:25.860
You're just like,
hey,
lump on,
I want to do a song.
I can't play.

354
00:22:25.861 --> 00:22:28.470
Like all those like guitar,
God's back in the day.

355
00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:33.270
So instead I want to just plug in and turn up and like,
I know two,
so two courts,

356
00:22:33.271 --> 00:22:36.560
hey,
here's a song.
That's it.
It's not really all punk kids.
That's odd.

357
00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:40.770
So it's bullshit.
It's bullshit.
It's bullshit with like balls,

358
00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:44.130
bullshit with ball and like the mentality,
you know,

359
00:22:44.131 --> 00:22:48.860
cause like they couldn't play as good.
The purist American music.
Yeah.

360
00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:50.470
Actually,
you know,
cause it kind of started,
I,

361
00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:54.260
some people argue it started in England,
but it's,
well yeah,
I say attitude of,

362
00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:58.590
of of bullshit with balls.
Yes.
That's,
that's,
that's,
that's why it's so American.

363
00:22:58.591 --> 00:22:59.424
It's so beautiful.

364
00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:03.870
Is that American music or it's got a lot of people just got into art too.

365
00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:06.510
You know what I mean?
Like,
you know,
I mean black flag,

366
00:23:06.511 --> 00:23:09.240
which was produced Henry Rollins and

367
00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:13.200
cats like that,
you know,
and you know,
I mean then there's,
you,

368
00:23:13.290 --> 00:23:15.790
there's the spectrum is wide too because there's people like

369
00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:21.470
GG Allen Shit.
I was just like,

370
00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:25.410
he'd come in and throw himself through a glass window and take a shit on stage.

371
00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:34.800
She wasn't even about the music,
but it was punk.
Rock punk is like an umbrella,

372
00:23:34.801 --> 00:23:37.680
you know,
it's like hip hop,
you know there's like art,
punk,
art,
punk,

373
00:23:37.681 --> 00:23:39.250
fashion expression

374
00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:41.160
<v 5>and rebellion and admitting that you're,</v>

375
00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:45.860
or accepting and in and sort of being enthusiastic about the fact that you're

376
00:23:45.861 --> 00:23:46.190
rebelling

377
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:47.780
<v 8>against the system.
I was from the burbs,</v>

378
00:23:47.781 --> 00:23:50.330
so I took it as a bunch of angry burbs kids.

379
00:23:50.331 --> 00:23:55.280
I couldn't like do shit and express anything.
So instead they just like,
you know,

380
00:23:55.281 --> 00:23:57.380
it was just like anger,
like,
well you said misplaced anger,

381
00:23:57.381 --> 00:23:59.750
but it seeps into politics.

382
00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:03.490
<v 6>Right,
right,
right.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

383
00:24:03.491 --> 00:24:08.491
Punk is a weird thing because I wasn't really a part of punk as a scene when it

384
00:24:08.801 --> 00:24:11.570
was happening.
I learned about it later,
you know what I mean?
And that kind of,

385
00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:14.860
I look at it from a standpoint of the band's not that like fans,

386
00:24:14.861 --> 00:24:16.510
you know what I mean?
There was a lot of smart bands,
you know,

387
00:24:16.511 --> 00:24:19.480
food guys eating and stuff like that.
The whole DC scene,

388
00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:22.840
bad brains is like responsible for like half of the hardcore music.

389
00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:25.480
Do you like hardcore bands?
Like,
you know,

390
00:24:25.481 --> 00:24:28.720
and I'll guarantee you any of them somewhere.
So if the not them,

391
00:24:28.721 --> 00:24:31.090
whoever influenced them was influenced by bad brains.

392
00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:34.600
The first band to play fast that like fast pumps

393
00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:41.100
but could play and they were like reggae looking Rastafar I'd do this plan

394
00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:46.120
hardcore like punk music.
It was,
it was ill is suicidal tendencies is that pump?

395
00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:50.320
Yes.
Okay.
Well I love those dudes.
That song bring me down.

396
00:24:50.321 --> 00:24:53.800
You can't bring me down.
God Damn is that a good workout song?

397
00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:58.480
Music like that's aggressive fucking song.

398
00:24:58.690 --> 00:25:00.430
There's a ton of like just whatever.

399
00:25:00.431 --> 00:25:03.060
But there's some really good stuff out there.
Punk rock me,

400
00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:06.000
rock punk doesn't even exist anymore really.
You know what,

401
00:25:06.001 --> 00:25:07.150
anything that call up punk now.

402
00:25:07.151 --> 00:25:11.590
It's Kinda just like a marketing ploy or Chile or trying to be what punk once

403
00:25:11.591 --> 00:25:15.670
was in my opinion.
But if you're doing blues,

404
00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:19.800
are you trying to be what blues once was absolutely everybody at?
Absolutely.

405
00:25:21.270 --> 00:25:23.620
I mean that's like saying,
okay,
if I try to make blues,

406
00:25:23.890 --> 00:25:28.080
am I really fucking like some Delta fucking cotton picker?
Fucking know I'm,

407
00:25:28.081 --> 00:25:31.690
I'm emulating something.
You know what I mean?
But you're a dude who's lived,

408
00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:33.430
but I'm just saying,
it's like you got the,

409
00:25:33.431 --> 00:25:36.070
at the purest form of what that music and where it came from.
It's like,
no,

410
00:25:36.071 --> 00:25:38.500
I'm not that guy that invented,
you know,
I didn't invite that.

411
00:25:38.501 --> 00:25:41.740
I'm just saying it's a formula that it was there long before me and I'm just

412
00:25:41.741 --> 00:25:44.740
kind of using it to express myself.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
But it's still,

413
00:25:44.741 --> 00:25:48.600
you're doing blues,
you know,
and I think in it's in it's,
and it's,

414
00:25:48.670 --> 00:25:52.120
when it was happening was an original thing.
It hadn't been seen or done before.

415
00:25:52.121 --> 00:25:56.460
And they still do punk.
They do.
I'm just saying it's not still,
you can stay seen.

416
00:25:56.530 --> 00:25:59.500
I ain't seen nothing.
That was that.
I would put it this way.
I ain't seen nothing.

417
00:25:59.501 --> 00:26:01.060
New punk rock,

418
00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:04.990
everything that causes cell punk rock is like kind of a retro version of what

419
00:26:04.991 --> 00:26:06.670
used to be punk rock know.

420
00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:09.580
But I'll tell you the most punk rock thing I've seen in a long,

421
00:26:09.581 --> 00:26:12.910
long fucking time.
I've watched the guy's ass.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.

422
00:26:12.911 --> 00:26:16.150
I watched the fucking documentary on those pussy riot chicks.
Oh,

423
00:26:16.151 --> 00:26:20.140
those pictures are crazy.
I frequency writes gangsters,
gangsters,

424
00:26:20.141 --> 00:26:23.170
man in the courts and right in the face of the Russian government.

425
00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:27.820
Then broad stood tall.
I'm like,
Yo,
whatever you want to feel about them.

426
00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:30.880
I think what they should do,
all that shit was just,
you know,
that's gangster.

427
00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:32.710
That's,
they said something,
they did it.

428
00:26:32.711 --> 00:26:35.740
They stood for it and they didn't even fold up.
This is pretty gangster.
I mean,

429
00:26:35.741 --> 00:26:37.810
it was crazy.
I was like,
wow.
You know,

430
00:26:37.811 --> 00:26:41.260
at a certain point in time you have to realize that these things that you're

431
00:26:41.261 --> 00:26:44.100
calling churches are weird of behavior that

432
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:47.340
<v 3>were established but people thousands of years ago and they have literally</v>

433
00:26:47.341 --> 00:26:50.760
nothing to do with God.
If there is a god without a doubt,

434
00:26:50.761 --> 00:26:53.640
it has nothing to do with the bizarre behavior of these people that are claiming

435
00:26:53.641 --> 00:26:57.330
to represent him and no one person can be represented by God or whatever the

436
00:26:57.331 --> 00:26:59.880
idea of God is.
But then you can,
we're,

437
00:26:59.881 --> 00:27:03.150
we're all supposedly in this together and as soon as you have leaders and people

438
00:27:03.151 --> 00:27:05.940
who are in charge of organizations with very specific rules,

439
00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:10.740
you've missed the boat completely.
You know,
you're,
you're,
you're in some weird,

440
00:27:10.741 --> 00:27:14.970
cultish sort of a thing.
That's just what the fuck it is.
You know,

441
00:27:14.971 --> 00:27:16.890
people don't want to say that.
They don't want to believe that,

442
00:27:16.891 --> 00:27:20.460
but that's just what the fuck it is.
You know?
So when you,

443
00:27:20.461 --> 00:27:23.580
when you limit people like that and you,
you box them up like that,

444
00:27:23.581 --> 00:27:26.760
it said it's a dangerous thing.
It's always going to be a dangerous thing.

445
00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:30.420
So I was going to be a dangerous thing to control people like you can't,

446
00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:33.930
you gotta people got up just be nice to each other.
You can't be like,

447
00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:36.990
eventually we're going to figure out these borders are bullshit.

448
00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:39.540
Eventually we're going to look at all the borders all over the place.

449
00:27:39.541 --> 00:27:41.880
I'll go a little bit,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
Well,
why the fuck can can,

450
00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:43.290
why can't we just go over there?

451
00:27:43.530 --> 00:27:45.330
Why can't anybody to go wherever the fuck they want?

452
00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:49.170
Would that force everybody to even out the economic situation of the world.

453
00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:51.420
If people could just completely travel freely.

454
00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:54.480
Like one of the reasons why you going to have ghettos is cause you can keep them

455
00:27:54.481 --> 00:27:58.020
there.
You know,
if people could just go wherever the fuck they wanted to go,

456
00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:00.180
they would just go wherever the money is.

457
00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:03.180
People from Mexico just start walking into America and then you're going to have

458
00:28:03.181 --> 00:28:04.014
to deal with that.

459
00:28:04.050 --> 00:28:06.300
You're gonna have to deal with the fact that you connected to a third world

460
00:28:06.301 --> 00:28:09.870
country and people from Canada going to have our assholes sneaking into their

461
00:28:09.871 --> 00:28:11.220
borders and then goes,
okay,

462
00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:13.860
well we've got to tighten down the fucking fences here.
What's going on?

463
00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:15.450
We got these crazy asshole American

464
00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:18.860
<v 6>insanity are pretty tight buddy.
They are right now.</v>

465
00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:24.760
Right now if they open it up on a gun charge in 1992 I've like just started

466
00:28:25.311 --> 00:28:27.110
getting in again like this year.

467
00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:32.250
<v 3>What'd you have to do to get in?
Uh,
jump through some hoops.
Money.</v>

468
00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:36.200
I had a friend who,
who goes to hold over for a gun and it wasn't even illegal.

469
00:28:36.201 --> 00:28:39.800
He was legally in possession of a gun and every time he goes to Canada,

470
00:28:39.801 --> 00:28:42.840
they pull him in that room and they sit him down.
I stay.
Ask them a hunter cross?

471
00:28:42.841 --> 00:28:43.130
Yeah.

472
00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:45.170
<v 6>Huh?
They don't take kindly to it,</v>

473
00:28:45.171 --> 00:28:47.490
but if you would've got caught with 10 pounds of weed,
they don't trip that hard.

474
00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:50.380
<v 3>Go ahead Ted Pounds.
Go ahead.
Up in.</v>

475
00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:54.130
We're not worried about even smoke that much weed before it goes bad.
Sure.

476
00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:59.080
10 pounds of weed die trying.
How many,
how many years is that of weed?

477
00:28:59.110 --> 00:29:03.190
That's a few years of weed,
right?
Gotta be three weeks.
Unless you're just crazy.

478
00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:06.790
Joey Diaz could smoke a pound a year.
More than that.

479
00:29:07.570 --> 00:29:10.480
I'm trying to figure how much this,
how much is a pound?

480
00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:14.800
I'm thinking of like an 18 ounces and then I'm thinking a 16 ounces in a pound.

481
00:29:15.010 --> 00:29:17.620
That's not that much.
You can sell 160 ounces.

482
00:29:17.710 --> 00:29:20.260
You get smoke that in a few months if you were going,
Joe De is style.

483
00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:24.310
I've never even held a pound yet.
Neither have,
I don't want to be around a pound.

484
00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:25.210
If you're read a pallet

485
00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:29.540
<v 6>like a house,
no days would probably last me a couple months.</v>

486
00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:32.510
Look back in the day I would've done had been,
it would probably,

487
00:29:32.610 --> 00:29:36.190
it would have been about a week,
like two the head just from me.
Well pound,

488
00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:40.040
no one else.
Oh Jesus.
So it would,
it took me 160 weeks.

489
00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:42.050
10 yeah

490
00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:46.330
<v 5>he did that.
I probably smoked 10 pounds in 160 weeks.
That makes sense.</v>

491
00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:49.600
52 weeks a year I can do that.
Makes Sense.
I can do announce a month.
Yeah,

492
00:29:49.601 --> 00:29:51.070
that totally makes sense.
That sounds it.
Wow.

493
00:29:51.071 --> 00:29:52.780
That's really brilliant calculations actually.

494
00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:57.190
That sounds like that's like some serious we'd economics you broke it down

495
00:29:57.191 --> 00:30:01.510
probably.
Exactly.
That's no exaggeration in that there was no,
you know,

496
00:30:01.570 --> 00:30:02.800
there's no hyperbole

497
00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:09.450
because it was part of the money this week is all right.
400 for an ounce a week,

498
00:30:10.570 --> 00:30:13.930
every week.
That was every week.
That was like my loan shark almost thing.

499
00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:17.140
Cause sometimes I go in and be like,
give me three and I'll get you next week.

500
00:30:17.141 --> 00:30:21.000
And,
uh,
you know,
so you had to be steady.
Which do you see the,

501
00:30:21.001 --> 00:30:24.350
the changes that are happening right now about with weed?
Well,

502
00:30:24.370 --> 00:30:29.350
we just did a thing in Seattle called hemp fest and it is wide the fuck open up

503
00:30:29.351 --> 00:30:34.050
their dog.
We went to what?
What was it called?
The Dab.
A Bar?
Yeah.

504
00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:38.410
Dab Dab dude.
Like do the waxy,

505
00:30:38.411 --> 00:30:43.210
like bong hit shit.
But it was like a open bar open,
like open to the public.

506
00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:48.520
Oh,
is that a picture of it?
It was like along the waterfront,

507
00:30:48.521 --> 00:30:52.360
a three mile long festival.
Cops were handing out to retos a yeah.

508
00:30:52.361 --> 00:30:54.700
My friend booty chicken told me about that.
What does that,

509
00:30:57.130 --> 00:31:02.080
oh my God,
that's a lot of pot hemp fest did.

510
00:31:02.170 --> 00:31:06.160
He showed me a picture of a door knob.
That's,
it looks like a donut.
Look at it.

511
00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:07.113
All those joints,

512
00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:10.050
it looks like a door knob and that'll be actually a cool door knob.

513
00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:12.490
You take a photo of that and recreate it perfectly.

514
00:31:14.730 --> 00:31:17.830
It's a lot of fucking joints.
What's a big tin of joints?

515
00:31:17.831 --> 00:31:20.110
And it looks like a Dornier sitting on a door.

516
00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:22.850
The pictures,

517
00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:27.370
the pictures unusual because there's a wooden door that looks like it's like
the,

518
00:31:27.371 --> 00:31:29.770
uh,
the table looks like a wooden door.
So this box on it,

519
00:31:29.771 --> 00:31:32.920
it looks like a doorknob.
Yeah,
the prince.
A lot of goddamn joints.
Yeah.

520
00:31:32.921 --> 00:31:35.140
I would get nervous.
I'd run out of the room.
If you had that,
I'd be like,

521
00:31:35.141 --> 00:31:38.230
that's too much.
We're going to get busted for selling.

522
00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:40.820
That's like if you have more than a certain amount.

523
00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:44.620
They were just slinging weed and do not give,
they give zero fucks up in Seattle.

524
00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:47.050
Seattle is a beautiful place.
I love it up there.

525
00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:48.910
It's one of my favorite cities ever.

526
00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:51.280
It's like they have to deal with some shit because of the,

527
00:31:51.281 --> 00:31:55.240
the stinky weather in the winter.
But you know,
the roads don't really ice up,

528
00:31:55.310 --> 00:31:55.931
you know,
you've got to look,

529
00:31:55.931 --> 00:31:58.450
they're just cool with anything that's going to keep motherfuckers from jumping

530
00:31:58.451 --> 00:32:02.650
out of windows and shit like,
well,
they're also really smart up there.

531
00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:04.660
So real smart city,
like per capita,

532
00:32:04.690 --> 00:32:06.930
very unusually smart because creating this stone,

533
00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:10.130
one of the higher suicide rates because of the weather and whatnot.

534
00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:12.700
Without a doubt.
Yeah.
Without a doubt.
This is not make you happy,

535
00:32:12.910 --> 00:32:16.240
does not make you happy a lot.
A lot.
A lot.

536
00:32:16.510 --> 00:32:18.310
But that shit builds character.

537
00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:25.170
It builds character drugs.
Not necessarily my making,

538
00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:29.290
just a little more expressive.
I don't know if you felt trapped in it though,
man.

539
00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:32.620
Like guys like you and me,
we could always be like,
fuck this.
I'm going,

540
00:32:32.621 --> 00:32:37.480
I'm going to San Diego or I'm going to Hawaii for a week.
I'm out.
Yeah,

541
00:32:37.481 --> 00:32:40.130
you could do that.
Yeah.
That and people who lived there,

542
00:32:40.131 --> 00:32:42.410
they say if you can schedule a vacation,

543
00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:46.190
you'd go in the winter and he goes somewhere where it's sunny period.
You know,

544
00:32:46.191 --> 00:32:47.240
you don't do anything goofy,

545
00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:50.510
you know you're not going to somewhere that's shitty or where you're at,

546
00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:54.370
you know,
go somewhere cold.
You go to the beach,
bitch.
That's what you're doing.

547
00:32:54.371 --> 00:32:55.220
I thought of it that way.

548
00:32:55.221 --> 00:32:58.610
Like that would be cool to have like a Ho like live in Seattle and then just get

549
00:32:58.611 --> 00:33:00.650
the fuck out of there.
If you get to totally be cool.

550
00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:06.050
Be Cool to live in Seattle period.
Yeah.
I think you'd deal with the rain city.

551
00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:09.590
The folks are good up there.
It's a very artistic city.
Like it just,

552
00:33:09.591 --> 00:33:11.810
it doesn't seem like a city that has a lot of chains.

553
00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:14.860
You know when you drive it through,
you see like a lot of individual restaurants,

554
00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:20.090
individual stores to see a lot of unique to Seattle.
You know,

555
00:33:20.091 --> 00:33:23.150
and I think that's one of the reasons why the music scene at a Seattle and Jimmy

556
00:33:23.151 --> 00:33:27.770
motherfucking Hendrix came from Seattle respect.
Okay.

557
00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:31.110
You know,
I mean everybody knows nirvana came from Seattle.
What is it like?

558
00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:35.360
I don't know.
But that's the environment that created that,
those people,

559
00:33:35.410 --> 00:33:36.120
you know what I'm saying?

560
00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:39.740
Like there's an intensely creative environment that creative Ivana,

561
00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:43.490
I mean that that band was intensely creative,
you know,

562
00:33:43.710 --> 00:33:48.490
was also raped me like holy shit.
Like that whole sub pop records seen.

563
00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:51.850
They were,
they were pretty much kind of music.
Were they?
That was all that stuff.

564
00:33:51.910 --> 00:33:54.610
What,
what'd you call that growing big?
Called a [inaudible].

565
00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:56.190
It was just rock and roll.
I mean they would,

566
00:33:56.510 --> 00:34:00.890
they would have just called it rock and roll hardcore.
They started off punk.

567
00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:04.340
They started up punk.
Yeah.
Wow.
Yeah,
they were fucking,

568
00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:06.180
there was a hardcore music movement.

569
00:34:06.210 --> 00:34:09.350
They called it hardcore after punk towards the end,
I'll never forget,
I forgot,

570
00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:10.670
found out about Nirvana.

571
00:34:10.671 --> 00:34:13.340
I was out where this dude's house that I used to buy stolen radios from.

572
00:34:14.110 --> 00:34:15.380
That was this one dude,

573
00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:18.740
if you needed to radio back then when I did understand Karma,
you know,

574
00:34:18.741 --> 00:34:20.960
you need to radio from your car.
You can get one from,
uh,

575
00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:22.700
this kid who always had radios.

576
00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:26.210
Then it would just somehow or another get and you didn't ask any questions,

577
00:34:26.211 --> 00:34:29.840
but you knew they were stolen.
Uh,
we were over his house and he was into music.

578
00:34:29.930 --> 00:34:34.850
This kid,
it was just a bad kid,
you know,
whatever.
Bad suburban kid,
not too bad.

579
00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:38.480
We went over his house and he goes,
this is going to change music.
I said,

580
00:34:38.481 --> 00:34:40.190
what is it?
He goes,
it's called fucking Nevada.

581
00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:44.840
And he starts playing it and he goes,
all those hairbands,
those guys are fucked.

582
00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:48.350
And he played this shit.
I was like,
wow.
Like you just nailed it.

583
00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:53.480
Like this kid nailed it in his,
in his bedroom in Newton,
Massachusetts.

584
00:34:53.690 --> 00:34:58.640
Like right when the w nevermind came out.
This kid nailed it.

585
00:34:58.670 --> 00:35:02.690
He just was an,
he was just a radio theater and he was like,
this is,

586
00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:06.290
this is going to change.
This goes guys are fucked.
It was that obvious though.

587
00:35:06.350 --> 00:35:09.820
It's that obvious.
Danny boy played it for me first.
Like I was like,

588
00:35:09.830 --> 00:35:14.420
and we were both like,
yeah they draws dropped this only been a few times.

589
00:35:14.421 --> 00:35:18.220
And like musical history when someone hits some new levels of something we that

590
00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:21.860
you'd never seen it before.
And when Nirvana came out that was like,
Whoa,

591
00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:26.270
I'm deniable talent.
Undeniable uniqueness.

592
00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:29.870
The power of their songs.
Song after song.
Different honest though.
Yeah.

593
00:35:29.930 --> 00:35:34.400
Oh totally honest,
honest,
raw and like this insane heroin way.

594
00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:38.130
You know this insane heroin honesty spawned

595
00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:41.990
<v 6>by the punk movement.
Is that,
what is it about Alice and chains chains?</v>

596
00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:45.330
They weren't,
they were rounded like that.
They were more on the metal side to me,

597
00:35:45.331 --> 00:35:49.140
but like they were definitely of that grunge ish metal movement to like sound

598
00:35:49.141 --> 00:35:52.560
garden,
you know,
they like rocked out a little harder.
You know that song,

599
00:35:52.561 --> 00:35:55.080
them bones,
she's Christ.

600
00:35:55.081 --> 00:35:57.630
That makes you feel like you're dying when you're listening to it.

601
00:35:57.870 --> 00:36:01.050
Jerry Cantrell's a beach.
That was the dude who was sad.

602
00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:04.980
He that mother fucker understood that he was dying when he wrote that song.

603
00:36:05.010 --> 00:36:08.010
He understood that he was on that path when he wrote that song and I don't
think,

604
00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:12.480
I don't think lane rope tows.
He just sang it.
Yeah,
I think Jerry control road,

605
00:36:12.481 --> 00:36:16.320
all that stuff.
Wow.
I'm pretty sure it whatever.

606
00:36:16.350 --> 00:36:17.680
There may be a few that I'm wrong,

607
00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:22.700
but at the bulk and the temper form that what I'm saying is like the way Layne

608
00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:27.900
Staley hit notes like it made you like,
it made you feel that you were dying.

609
00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:33.180
Like that song going to end up a big old pile.
Them bones like that screaming.

610
00:36:33.181 --> 00:36:37.050
It was like Jesus Christ.
I remember the first time I saw a man in the box,

611
00:36:37.051 --> 00:36:40.020
like on MTV.
It was like,
what the hell is that?
God Damn,

612
00:36:40.021 --> 00:36:43.800
those guys were intense and it was crazy and that that kind of,

613
00:36:43.830 --> 00:36:48.690
I had a night with that dude and and another guy,
Layne Staley.
Yeah.
Yeah,

614
00:36:48.691 --> 00:36:53.110
I did.
It was good to know.
We just slowly,
sorry,
motor,

615
00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:57.000
this promoter and Philly book,
this,
this place,

616
00:36:57.001 --> 00:37:00.450
I believe it was the electric factory,
like you know,
thousand seater club,

617
00:37:00.451 --> 00:37:03.510
something like that.
He booked it twice in one night.
He did two shows.

618
00:37:03.511 --> 00:37:05.190
He didn't Alison change show early,

619
00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:08.910
kicked everybody out than to the house painting show.

620
00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.330
Well we showed out to the place twice in one night,
but we all,

621
00:37:12.331 --> 00:37:15.810
because you know we were all at the same hotel,
so like we,
I saw these guys,

622
00:37:15.811 --> 00:37:18.400
we were coming back from hotel,
me and Dj Lito and they were like,
Yo,
it was,

623
00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:19.980
we were like,
Hey,
what's up?
We're going to go up to the room,

624
00:37:19.981 --> 00:37:22.230
smoke one party a little bit.
They were like,
all right.
We came up,

625
00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:25.980
him and his buddy and they came up and they sat at the table and we are rolling

626
00:37:25.981 --> 00:37:28.840
joints and we're talking all this shit and like me and lethal to just rolling

627
00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:30.530
all joint after joint,
throwing them out and say table.

628
00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:33.690
And then we stopped and we go to light one and both the dudes are sitting there

629
00:37:33.691 --> 00:37:38.400
just completely knotted out cold.
Wow.
Cigarette's burned into their fingers like,

630
00:37:38.401 --> 00:37:41.940
and we were like,
what the fuck was,
we weren't really hit.
We were kind of naive,

631
00:37:41.970 --> 00:37:45.360
you know what I mean?
We were like,
didn't realize they were on heroin,

632
00:37:45.390 --> 00:37:48.240
you know what I mean?
By that time we had,
but it was like,
you know,

633
00:37:48.241 --> 00:37:52.440
the whole time they were just like,
you know,
wow.

634
00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:57.940
Sniffing or smoking shit out of a tin foil.

635
00:37:58.470 --> 00:38:01.230
Like oh no,
I've done that before.

636
00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:04.440
We even really joyous man.
You know what I'm say?

637
00:38:04.450 --> 00:38:06.290
You didn't even realize they were doing it.
Nah,

638
00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:12.000
it was like they were rolling in our presence for the matter of like 15 minutes.

639
00:38:12.270 --> 00:38:17.160
Stone Temple pilots performed for Dana White as birthday party once.

640
00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:21.680
And it was one of the best fucking live shows I've ever seen in my life.
Oh yeah.

641
00:38:22.050 --> 00:38:25.800
Like we want to talk about some dudes who,
who like are solid professional.

642
00:38:25.801 --> 00:38:29.100
I don't know if you know those guys are,
have any,
I've met him.

643
00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:32.160
I couldn't tell you.
I don't like them.

644
00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:33.780
I don't know if I'm going to go fuck themselves.

645
00:38:34.530 --> 00:38:35.990
If you know you're tell me you don't like them.

646
00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:40.600
<v 5>I've met them at shows,</v>

647
00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:43.180
festivals kind of situations a couple of times I wouldn't seem like,

648
00:38:43.181 --> 00:38:46.000
all right dudes,
I was blown away because it was a private party.

649
00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:47.590
It wasn't that many people there.
There was like,
you know,

650
00:38:47.591 --> 00:38:49.190
a couple hundred people maybe,
you know,

651
00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:52.990
it was Dana's birthday party was all his friends and,
and you know,
I'm like,

652
00:38:52.991 --> 00:38:56.110
you got stone temple fucking pilots to do this,
you know,
to the,

653
00:38:56.111 --> 00:38:58.420
the people that did it,
like Dana didn't even know.
I don't think,

654
00:38:58.421 --> 00:39:01.270
I'm pretty sure they did.
The whole,
the whole Party was a surprise.

655
00:39:01.450 --> 00:39:04.720
So I don't think he knew that stone temple pilots was hired to play it for him.

656
00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:06.910
I don't think he had any idea until we brought him out.

657
00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:12.180
But to see stone temple pilots just rocket like there's 18,000 motherfuckers on

658
00:39:13.361 --> 00:39:13.841
their feet.

659
00:39:13.841 --> 00:39:18.460
I mean that that dude can fucking perform with a hundred whatever it was.

660
00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:21.970
200 people in that room.
That guy went off.
It was magnetic.

661
00:39:21.971 --> 00:39:24.970
I learned about performing,
watching him,
I felt like an amateur.

662
00:39:25.150 --> 00:39:28.210
I was watching this guy like does his,
his,
his fucking,

663
00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:30.640
his commitment to every step,

664
00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:33.790
everything that he did that the energy to those songs.
I was like,

665
00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:37.000
everything I do,
I suck at this guys.
This is,
this is incredible.
Yeah.

666
00:39:37.001 --> 00:39:40.180
He doesn't check out.
Didn't check out at all.
It was,
it was interesting,

667
00:39:40.350 --> 00:39:42.940
but it's obviously very different than your acoustic sets,

668
00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:46.450
which are equally interesting.
This,
it's a weird thing that you could,

669
00:39:47.010 --> 00:39:50.500
they could have two things that are completely different on the spectrum,

670
00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:54.160
but both have like an equal impact because of their honesty.

671
00:39:54.370 --> 00:39:56.060
Whether it's a beautiful acoustic song,

672
00:39:56.070 --> 00:39:59.530
let's really emotional or whether it's that raped me song.
It's just like that.

673
00:39:59.531 --> 00:40:03.040
It just hits that note,
whatever it is by any weird way.

674
00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:05.710
It gets there but ain't fucking ups or downs,

675
00:40:05.711 --> 00:40:10.360
whether it's depressing or you know,
or in enlightening whatever it is.

676
00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:14.350
It's what he hits that note.
You know,
he got kicked out,
you know that.
Who did?

677
00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:15.513
Scott Wayland.

678
00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:18.040
I got kicked out of stone temple file probably for being too awesome.

679
00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:21.670
Thanks for that.
Awesome.
It's pretty hard to work with regular people.

680
00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:25.380
I went with drugs.
I went,
Oh shit.
Uh,

681
00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:30.330
Dana did that once with Joan jet at the Viper Room.
Oh really?
Wow.

682
00:40:30.930 --> 00:40:35.710
It was God.
I would love to see that a hundred people and she just did the same,

683
00:40:35.711 --> 00:40:40.150
just rocked out.
Yeah.
But I know,
I know,
you know that check was beautiful.

684
00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:47.110
I know what the stone temple pilots thing was.
I asked,
I can't tell,
but I asked.

685
00:40:47.170 --> 00:40:48.430
It was very nice.

686
00:40:49.110 --> 00:40:53.650
It's very nice evening for those gentlemen,
but I'm telling you,

687
00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:56.970
they did not treat it like it was like,
uh,

688
00:40:57.010 --> 00:41:01.270
a private party that they could like barely get there and barely do the show
for.

689
00:41:01.450 --> 00:41:02.680
That's what blew me away.

690
00:41:02.830 --> 00:41:05.560
It was like this dude was at a private party and you know,
I mean,

691
00:41:05.561 --> 00:41:07.390
maybe he's a big UFC fan.
I don't know.

692
00:41:07.391 --> 00:41:09.580
I don't know if that was part of his motivation,

693
00:41:09.581 --> 00:41:14.500
but these motherfuckers nailed it.
I mean just destroyed,
you know?
I mean,

694
00:41:14.501 --> 00:41:17.260
we were just people who weren't musicians like me and some of my other friends

695
00:41:17.261 --> 00:41:21.370
would just look at each other going,
God Damn God damn.

696
00:41:21.390 --> 00:41:25.030
How much Joe [inaudible] favorite band?
100 roses.

697
00:41:27.310 --> 00:41:31.180
I can't tell you man.
It's confidential shit.
75 roads.
It's a lot of cash.
Sun,

698
00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:36.360
they get [inaudible] son.
It's too bad.
Broke up.

699
00:41:36.361 --> 00:41:37.620
But it doesn't that always happen.

700
00:41:38.010 --> 00:41:41.010
It's like when you get a fat band together and they start kicking ass,

701
00:41:41.250 --> 00:41:43.950
eventually it's fucking wheels fall off of that thing.

702
00:41:44.370 --> 00:41:47.370
It's like how many bands here completely keep it together for a long period of

703
00:41:47.371 --> 00:41:49.830
time.
It's like kiss and like how many,

704
00:41:49.831 --> 00:41:53.250
and even though they lost ace freely and Peter Criss don't have like a fake ace

705
00:41:53.251 --> 00:41:58.240
freely.
Yeah,
he is.
Gene Simmons is any needs Paul Stanley.

706
00:41:58.241 --> 00:41:59.140
So yeah.

707
00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:03.470
But I'm sure all kept in line dating.

708
00:42:03.810 --> 00:42:08.590
Seemed like he,
uh,
he,
he,
uh,
keeps things in,
in tight tow.

709
00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:11.680
The only time I was ever nervous at a comedy show because someone was in the

710
00:42:11.681 --> 00:42:12.130
audience,

711
00:42:12.130 --> 00:42:16.570
Jean Simmons came to see me on New Year's and I was legitimately legitimately

712
00:42:16.571 --> 00:42:18.940
shitting my pants because I'm a huge,
when I was a kid,

713
00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:22.780
my uncle actually worked for Howard marks advertising and they're the guys who

714
00:42:22.781 --> 00:42:27.280
used to make the ads and the album covers for kiss.
And uh,

715
00:42:27.281 --> 00:42:31.660
so I made,
I met ace freely when I was like six,
seven,
seven years old,

716
00:42:31.661 --> 00:42:36.070
six years old.
I was a little kid and he had no makeup on and I was like,

717
00:42:36.071 --> 00:42:39.310
just getting into kiss back then and I couldn't believe that I'm looking at him

718
00:42:39.311 --> 00:42:42.610
and he's got no makeup on because my uncle had like give me his records and I'd

719
00:42:42.611 --> 00:42:43.810
listened to the songs.
I,

720
00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:47.080
I became a fan because my uncle would give me free kiss records.
Like that's,

721
00:42:47.290 --> 00:42:50.950
so seeing him with no makeup on,
it was like,
to me it was a real freak out.

722
00:42:51.130 --> 00:42:54.250
So having Gene Simmons in the audience.
Even when I was 40 years old,

723
00:42:54.550 --> 00:42:58.060
I was still like,
Yikes,
this is weird man.

724
00:42:58.150 --> 00:43:02.410
That's gene fucking Simmons.
Gene Simmons from kiss.
I saw him,

725
00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:04.120
I saw them when I was a kid.

726
00:43:04.121 --> 00:43:06.610
I saw them when I was like seven or eight years old and I saw them again when I

727
00:43:06.611 --> 00:43:10.090
was like 25 me and Kevin James who is a huge kiss fan,

728
00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:15.280
I believe Kevin James is a huge kiss fan and me and Kevin James,

729
00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:16.650
we went to two shows.

730
00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:20.730
We went to two shows when they came back to La with a full kiss with Peter Criss

731
00:43:20.731 --> 00:43:23.580
and ace freely in makeup and we were like,

732
00:43:23.581 --> 00:43:27.570
you just complete unapologetic dorks.

733
00:43:27.690 --> 00:43:30.570
We were reliving our childhood together,

734
00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:35.190
unapologetically rocking out to a kiss concert and it to Chris.

735
00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:39.600
I mean he was air guitar and Kevin James is fun to go to a fucking kiss concert

736
00:43:39.601 --> 00:43:41.400
with cause he fucking sings the songs.

737
00:43:41.401 --> 00:43:44.640
He like gets into it and this is back before people knew who he was,

738
00:43:44.641 --> 00:43:45.510
he wouldn't be able to do that.

739
00:43:45.511 --> 00:43:48.630
Now you have like a scene in one of his movies where that's what he's doing.

740
00:43:48.631 --> 00:43:51.180
He's like,
oh sure.
Playing guitar hero or something.

741
00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:55.170
I wished if somebody filled great rock city or something like that.

742
00:43:55.830 --> 00:43:59.310
If somebody had filmed Kevin and I are going to seek kiss back in the day,

743
00:43:59.610 --> 00:44:03.780
that would have been a fucking hilarious video because nobody knew who he was

744
00:44:03.781 --> 00:44:06.210
back then.
This was before his TV show.

745
00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:08.850
It was like he had was like a semi known comedian.

746
00:44:08.851 --> 00:44:12.180
If you watch star search or something like that so he could be like free and

747
00:44:12.181 --> 00:44:14.190
public and not worry about anybody.
Weird,
not him.

748
00:44:14.370 --> 00:44:16.780
So he just completely rocked out Detroit.

749
00:44:21.070 --> 00:44:24.340
Get down.
It was just like a free show.
No,

750
00:44:24.530 --> 00:44:28.200
like especially like being a feller kiss fan.

751
00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:32.340
It was awesome.
Kevin is fucking hilarious.

752
00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:35.700
That guy's one of the funniest guys that doesn't get credit for it.

753
00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:38.130
Like he's like real clean in his movies.

754
00:44:38.131 --> 00:44:41.700
He's like squeaky clean and let you know his stand up is like,

755
00:44:41.701 --> 00:44:44.100
he doesn't really talk about anything controversial,

756
00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:45.650
but if you can hang out with that cash,

757
00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:48.030
you hang out with that cat and get them to go full shimmy.

758
00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:49.800
That's who we used to call him.
His nickname is shimmy.

759
00:44:49.801 --> 00:44:54.030
We'd call it going full shammy where it gets fucking mad at things fro shit gets

760
00:44:54.031 --> 00:44:56.640
red in the face and he's putting on a show for you.
You know,
he's,

761
00:44:56.641 --> 00:45:00.660
he's doing a bit,
some of the funniest,
the hardest I've ever laughed.

762
00:45:00.661 --> 00:45:01.770
It's just hanging out with him.
Like,

763
00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:05.910
like having him recreating an argument that he had with his girlfriend,
you know,

764
00:45:05.911 --> 00:45:09.400
like,
and him going crazy and red in the face.
He was a,

765
00:45:09.401 --> 00:45:10.770
he's a fucking hilarious dude,

766
00:45:10.890 --> 00:45:14.130
but he does movies that are like more like for families and kids.

767
00:45:14.310 --> 00:45:17.820
Some people don't get to see that aspect of him too bad,
you know,

768
00:45:17.910 --> 00:45:19.380
we don't want to balance to world.

769
00:45:19.381 --> 00:45:22.350
We don't want to do to do kids' movies and still,
you know,

770
00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:25.050
that's why we should have him on the podcast for sure.
He wouldn't do it.

771
00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:29.700
Saget was one of the dirtiest comics ever used to be.
Yeah.

772
00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:33.660
And I guess he was full House for,
he was like the full House Guy.

773
00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:35.910
I think he stopped doing standard during that time.
Yeah.

774
00:45:35.911 --> 00:45:38.160
Now he's super dirty and playing off the full house.

775
00:45:38.161 --> 00:45:42.360
That's back to the dirty thing.
Yeah.
I think they probably told them,
hey dude,

776
00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:45.240
this is like a hundred million dollar business we're running here.

777
00:45:45.270 --> 00:45:45.961
Do you understand that?

778
00:45:45.961 --> 00:45:49.620
And you could fuck that up by telling a Dick joke at the laugh factory.

779
00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:52.080
So why don't you just lay off that you're getting,
you know,

780
00:45:52.110 --> 00:45:54.420
x amount of millions a week.
And I always a,

781
00:45:54.470 --> 00:45:55.980
and they did that with Tim Allen as well.

782
00:45:56.010 --> 00:45:58.620
They told Tim Allen and stopped doing a stand up because it was a little

783
00:45:58.621 --> 00:46:03.030
controversial.
I Dunno.
It's crazy.
And that's TV though.

784
00:46:03.210 --> 00:46:06.210
All I know is I never got successful enough for anybody bother telling me to

785
00:46:06.211 --> 00:46:08.570
stop doing that.
Eddie,
they go write me a check.

786
00:46:08.690 --> 00:46:12.180
I have to do things when they start writing you checks not to do things.

787
00:46:12.181 --> 00:46:13.890
You're doing something right,
man.
Well,
I never got,

788
00:46:13.891 --> 00:46:17.700
I was never important enough in the equation where they asked me to not do

789
00:46:17.701 --> 00:46:20.160
something like it was going to fuck things up.
You know,

790
00:46:20.161 --> 00:46:23.190
like I guess like when fear factor came along,

791
00:46:23.310 --> 00:46:28.310
people will already sort of opening up to the idea that the world isn't exactly

792
00:46:28.321 --> 00:46:32.910
as we've been told and that there's a lot more variation in people then you

793
00:46:32.911 --> 00:46:37.320
would like to imagine.
And you know the world's a big fucking place.

794
00:46:37.321 --> 00:46:37.771
And of course,

795
00:46:37.771 --> 00:46:40.710
how could a dick joke fuck up a show where somebody who's going to eat like
goat,

796
00:46:40.711 --> 00:46:41.910
Dick.
You know what I mean?

797
00:46:42.090 --> 00:46:45.360
It's also you can express yourself now before where if you said something fucked

798
00:46:45.361 --> 00:46:46.200
up a long time ago,

799
00:46:46.201 --> 00:46:49.160
you had to get booked on the tonight show to explain yourself.
You know,

800
00:46:49.161 --> 00:46:51.930
I remember like when Hugh Grant got caught with the hooker and it was like the

801
00:46:51.931 --> 00:46:54.690
big thing and he went and Jay Leno,
well what the hell were you thinking?

802
00:46:54.930 --> 00:46:58.740
He gets it.
He could just do a video blog now.
You know what I'm saying?

803
00:46:58.741 --> 00:47:02.130
Like instantly have something where expresses himself.
Now there's like,

804
00:47:02.310 --> 00:47:05.820
there's so much range for expression now.
There's so much room,

805
00:47:05.850 --> 00:47:07.440
it's just a completely different world.

806
00:47:07.590 --> 00:47:09.870
You still have to apologize if you're Hugh grant though.

807
00:47:09.871 --> 00:47:14.460
Like you certain comedians like wouldn't have to apologize,
right?
Yeah.

808
00:47:14.461 --> 00:47:18.090
Well the guy like Hugh grant is selling that thing.
He's selling that.

809
00:47:18.091 --> 00:47:20.610
This one style is just as Kevin is selling,

810
00:47:20.611 --> 00:47:22.770
you know the squeaky clean family comedy.

811
00:47:22.830 --> 00:47:26.940
You know Hugh grant was telling the really sweet boyfriend guy who was from

812
00:47:26.941 --> 00:47:29.980
England and we'd like to help you move.
Can I caviol

813
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:34.980
<v 6>couch and who's not some crazy dude looking to get his dick sucked on the sneak</v>

814
00:47:35.141 --> 00:47:40.030
tip
already.
Street hooker.

815
00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:43.120
There's that too,
but okay.
You just reminded me of something.

816
00:47:43.150 --> 00:47:47.560
There's that English dude on CNN with the glasses who still on,

817
00:47:47.561 --> 00:47:51.580
but like three years ago the dude got caught like in central park,

818
00:47:51.581 --> 00:47:55.720
like with meth in his pocket and I'm like a noose around his cock and like all

819
00:47:55.730 --> 00:47:59.760
kinds of crazy shit.
It's Richard something.
Richard the British dude.

820
00:47:59.761 --> 00:48:02.830
You would all know him when you see him.
God's,
yeah.
What's his name again?

821
00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:05.770
Richard something.
CNN.
Richard.
Okay,

822
00:48:05.771 --> 00:48:10.150
so I'm going to Google CNN.
Richard,
never last.
Drop in facts again.

823
00:48:10.190 --> 00:48:14.860
What was the,
my brain works in crazy ways.
How about news?

824
00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:18.490
A reporter reporter.
Noose around Cox.
See what comes up.

825
00:48:19.150 --> 00:48:20.710
I'm going to have to say penis.
Look,

826
00:48:20.711 --> 00:48:25.120
here's Hugh grant's differ now because it's Google.
That's right now.
Yeah,

827
00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:29.290
she's sweet.
She's got a family family.
Sure.
She parlayed that into a life.

828
00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:33.430
Okay.
I'm the streets.
I don't see it here under that.

829
00:48:33.490 --> 00:48:36.520
So the story really is Hugh grant got someone off the streets.

830
00:48:36.620 --> 00:48:41.460
So reporter arrested math.
Did you say math?
Yeah.
Math central park.
Here's,

831
00:48:41.530 --> 00:48:44.530
here's a America.
Richard.
Fuck.
What the fuck is his name?
Richard something.

832
00:48:44.780 --> 00:48:46.840
It does American Eagle.
That is dangerous.

833
00:48:49.810 --> 00:48:50.643
What is this?

834
00:48:51.070 --> 00:48:56.070
What do you watching his Mexicans USA and it killed.

835
00:48:56.490 --> 00:49:01.230
That was an American Eagle.
Check this out that it ran into the window.
Yeah.

836
00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:05.920
No,
the died.
I think it was supposed,
you know it's a show.
It was like,
oh,

837
00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:07.990
it's a show.
I think so.

838
00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:15.910
Oh,
you nailed the window at full clip.
Yeah,
they die all the time like that.

839
00:49:15.911 --> 00:49:20.140
In my house.
Birds.
Birds are flying in my window.
They just fly any window.

840
00:49:20.141 --> 00:49:24.460
Sometimes they miss.
They don't realize what it is.
Yes.
It's always sparrows.

841
00:49:24.790 --> 00:49:27.970
Cute little things too.
It sucks.
I know there's,

842
00:49:27.971 --> 00:49:31.120
does that mean you could do to get rid of it?
Like a grilling?
Yeah.

843
00:49:31.121 --> 00:49:35.110
Dunkin did it throw them in the trash?
No,
I forget.
What did he say?

844
00:49:36.220 --> 00:49:39.100
Hmm.
Yeah.
I don't know what,
what you can do,

845
00:49:39.220 --> 00:49:43.300
but I remember he said he had a bird feeder and he had all these birds hitting

846
00:49:43.301 --> 00:49:47.560
his window.
I found a story,
a CNN reporter arrested in central park.

847
00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:50.590
What was named Richard,
what do you do to Richard Quest?

848
00:49:50.650 --> 00:49:55.650
Richard quest was officially arrested for loitering and drug possession in the,

849
00:49:56.020 --> 00:49:58.960
in the,
in Europe,
especially CNN like over there,

850
00:49:59.140 --> 00:50:02.170
he's like on all the time this guy got arrested like with uh,

851
00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:05.890
like something tied around his junk with math,

852
00:50:06.670 --> 00:50:11.370
like on like some rampage.
Well it says the New York Post included this Kinky,

853
00:50:11.371 --> 00:50:14.710
the kinky elements and an article on Saturday.

854
00:50:14.711 --> 00:50:19.090
So there was some kinky elements to it is around his cock.
I like man.

855
00:50:20.620 --> 00:50:23.470
Okay.
Yeah.
It says,
another website will tell the full story.

856
00:50:23.620 --> 00:50:27.530
Why do they withhold information and say the guy got a noose around his dick in

857
00:50:27.531 --> 00:50:28.340
the Ed math.

858
00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:32.890
<v 5>Don't say there's like,
but it's like student students didn't,</v>

859
00:50:32.940 --> 00:50:36.680
he didn't skip a step.
CNN didn't fire him.
They were just like,
all right,
Yo,
uh,

860
00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:40.730
good for him.
It's just crazy talented.
This is strike one.

861
00:50:40.790 --> 00:50:43.040
He's a good looking guy.
Okay.

862
00:50:43.310 --> 00:50:47.750
So Richard Quest was arrested early Friday morning for drug possession when

863
00:50:47.751 --> 00:50:51.770
people found in central park while after the parks 1:00 AM curfew.

864
00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:56.420
Wow.
You know what?
Well,
so what cal was out getting his freak on.

865
00:50:56.720 --> 00:51:00.440
I'm just saying he's a media guy.
I mean,
you'd think normally,
yeah.

866
00:51:00.441 --> 00:51:03.200
It wouldn't normally get them fired,
but maybe he's really good at what he does.

867
00:51:03.590 --> 00:51:06.440
And so they're like,
what happened?
Does like really corny kind of stories,
man.

868
00:51:06.441 --> 00:51:08.590
He just like,
I'm under a lot of pressure.

869
00:51:08.730 --> 00:51:09.880
<v 9>I have a feeling,</v>

870
00:51:10.730 --> 00:51:14.460
<v 5>you know,
maybe whoever he was going to meet with the math and the,</v>

871
00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:17.970
and the noose around his cock might be a superior at that.

872
00:51:17.971 --> 00:51:22.440
His job or something that's so funny.
Can't lose it.

873
00:51:23.130 --> 00:51:25.290
It wasn't immediately clear what the rope was for.

874
00:51:26.730 --> 00:51:28.630
<v 9>The officer on the scene was</v>

875
00:51:29.330 --> 00:51:33.800
<v 5>see the drug because of his prior experience as a police officer in drug</v>

876
00:51:33.801 --> 00:51:35.510
arrests.
Okay,

877
00:51:35.990 --> 00:51:39.200
so the guy had a package of math and he was headed home to his friend's house.

878
00:51:39.470 --> 00:51:44.240
It says his lawyer claims that Qwest was returning to his hotel with friends and

879
00:51:44.241 --> 00:51:46.100
had no idea there was a curfew for the park.

880
00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:49.150
I didn't know it was a curfew for the parking,
did I?
That's kind of weird.

881
00:51:49.180 --> 00:51:51.560
Isn't that like the whole thing about New York City so you could do whatever the

882
00:51:51.561 --> 00:51:53.590
fuck you want?
No,
it's everything's open.

883
00:51:53.591 --> 00:51:57.210
I think that stopped when people started winding up dead in the barn.

884
00:51:57.870 --> 00:52:00.860
No weird.
You can't have woods.
Even woods in the city.

885
00:52:00.861 --> 00:52:04.370
People start killing people and dragging them into bushes and chest were so

886
00:52:04.371 --> 00:52:07.760
creepy.
When it comes to woods,
what is that about?
You know,

887
00:52:07.790 --> 00:52:12.790
like women don't that women worry much more about getting like raped or attacked

888
00:52:12.951 --> 00:52:13.784
in the woods.

889
00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:18.000
<v 9>Like if you find men in the woods like it's way more dangerous than the man in</v>

890
00:52:18.001 --> 00:52:20.400
the city,
any rape with probably all the same.

891
00:52:20.550 --> 00:52:25.230
What about worrying about it?
Like if you ran into a man,

892
00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:29.160
<v 5>it's just you and the man in the woods.
It's way more of a rapey situation.</v>

893
00:52:29.310 --> 00:52:32.430
Then you run into a man in a city where there's all sorts of other people and

894
00:52:32.431 --> 00:52:35.550
all sorts of buildings,
and when you're out there in the woods,

895
00:52:35.580 --> 00:52:38.610
it's a totally different environment.
For a woman,
it must be,

896
00:52:38.700 --> 00:52:41.010
you must feel like ultra violent,
like,

897
00:52:41.070 --> 00:52:44.910
like ultra violent dudes that you could just stumble upon are super fucking

898
00:52:44.911 --> 00:52:47.070
dangerous if you're a woman.
Whereas if you're a guy,

899
00:52:47.340 --> 00:52:49.290
they're not going to fuck you.
They're going to look at you and go,
Hey,

900
00:52:49.291 --> 00:52:50.790
here's another guy camping.
You know,

901
00:52:50.791 --> 00:52:53.280
if you're a woman and you're out there in the woods by yourself,

902
00:52:53.281 --> 00:52:57.240
unless you seen deliverance,
I think that that movie is accurate.

903
00:52:58.110 --> 00:52:59.370
There are people that are out there.

904
00:52:59.550 --> 00:53:02.880
<v 9>May I see other guys even when I'm camping,
if they're not familiar,</v>

905
00:53:02.881 --> 00:53:05.660
I I start thinking rapey thoughts like,
hey man,

906
00:53:06.740 --> 00:53:08.160
I'm trying to get raped out here.

907
00:53:10.830 --> 00:53:12.220
We did bring a pistol,
right?

908
00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:17.250
<v 5>Yeah,
I would.
I really believe people get ready when it does.
Just out in nature.</v>

909
00:53:17.251 --> 00:53:18.790
Something prime who takes over man,

910
00:53:18.810 --> 00:53:22.080
they get more in touch with their animal natures.
Yeah.

911
00:53:22.081 --> 00:53:26.160
It's almost like with creating cities and spacing things and putting doors in

912
00:53:26.161 --> 00:53:29.610
front of this and you can lock that and you're secure in this room instead of

913
00:53:29.611 --> 00:53:33.530
like being all out in the open,
like we've like slowly moved away from the,
the,

914
00:53:33.531 --> 00:53:35.970
the primal instincts that have driven us to this point.

915
00:53:36.090 --> 00:53:39.750
But all you need is this room moved those buildings.
Yep.
Stuff.

916
00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:42.660
Everybody back in the trees again and the same shit.

917
00:53:42.661 --> 00:53:45.030
We'll start from scratch like really quick.

918
00:53:45.210 --> 00:53:47.010
The moment your kids start getting hungry,

919
00:53:47.340 --> 00:53:51.270
shit gets really fucking primal real quick.

920
00:53:51.420 --> 00:53:54.030
That's what I keep telling people.
Yeah.
Well nobody wants to believe that,

921
00:53:54.031 --> 00:53:59.031
that our civilization is just a thin veneer covering ancient barbaric genetics.

922
00:53:59.910 --> 00:54:03.180
Our civilization in the last couple hundred years to really,

923
00:54:03.181 --> 00:54:05.400
but if you go back to the fucking race riots in the,

924
00:54:05.401 --> 00:54:08.210
in the 60s and the fifties like,
isn't that like what,

925
00:54:08.211 --> 00:54:10.980
what kind of civilization is at what kind of civilization where they were just

926
00:54:10.981 --> 00:54:13.770
like completely discriminated against someone for the color of their skin.

927
00:54:13.860 --> 00:54:15.570
With all the books that were available.

928
00:54:16.140 --> 00:54:18.750
They had decided these people who are less than they were going to keep them at

929
00:54:18.751 --> 00:54:22.410
a certain bathrooms.
It tells us to fucking 1950s my grandma had,
you know,

930
00:54:22.700 --> 00:54:26.750
like separate schools.
My grandma and she's Mexican.
Jesus.
So how,

931
00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:30.210
how much civilization have,
we're really had,
how long has it really been around?

932
00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:32.460
No,
it's fucking barely here.

933
00:54:32.550 --> 00:54:37.230
It's barely here hanging on with vaccines and cell phones.
Barely here.

934
00:54:37.530 --> 00:54:41.280
But if the fucking power goes off or a big rock hits the ocean or one of those

935
00:54:41.281 --> 00:54:46.281
fucking volcanoes blows all or flare right back to 1,010 thousand years ago.

936
00:54:47.370 --> 00:54:50.430
Right back real quick.
Soon as we run out of lighters,

937
00:54:50.700 --> 00:54:53.450
soon as you run out of bullets,
right back to Craig.

938
00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:57.720
Take me a while to run out of bullets,
just so everybody know

939
00:54:59.430 --> 00:55:02.190
you hunt or do you just shoot targets?

940
00:55:02.191 --> 00:55:06.500
And Brian and I are actually very curious lately.
We're trying to find one.

941
00:55:06.510 --> 00:55:08.010
Probably take a class on how to like,
you know,

942
00:55:08.011 --> 00:55:11.580
go hunt and like actually killing and prepare an animal properly.

943
00:55:11.581 --> 00:55:15.750
You should go on Steve Rinella show.
You should go on that meat eaters show.

944
00:55:15.810 --> 00:55:20.480
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
I'm not familiar,
but I want to,
you know,
I,
plus I always feel,

945
00:55:20.510 --> 00:55:22.710
I feel like this as a meat eater,

946
00:55:23.430 --> 00:55:27.630
I feel like I have the responsibility to actually have to go through and do

947
00:55:28.050 --> 00:55:31.260
butcher an animal once and I've never had to do it in my life.
I understand it.

948
00:55:31.261 --> 00:55:35.430
I've seen it on film,
but it's like I still feel like if I can't do it,

949
00:55:35.431 --> 00:55:40.200
if I can't stomach doing it,
I have no business eating meat.
I feel the same way.

950
00:55:40.290 --> 00:55:43.660
That was my motivation to go a hunt with him.
Yeah.

951
00:55:43.860 --> 00:55:47.250
I want it to a experience it and I wanted to experience it with a completely

952
00:55:47.251 --> 00:55:50.090
wild,
we took a canoe,
we went down to Missouri breaks,

953
00:55:50.091 --> 00:55:54.980
we went on the Missouri River.
It was amazing.
Cause then I'm game was,

954
00:55:54.990 --> 00:55:57.450
it was beautiful.
It's hard work though,
man.
You're,
you're,

955
00:55:57.451 --> 00:56:00.330
you're huffing it over these hills.
Like if you're out of shape,

956
00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:04.380
it's really hard because you're doing a lot of high elevation hiking and it

957
00:56:04.381 --> 00:56:06.540
doesn't seem like notch because you're walking kind of slow,

958
00:56:06.541 --> 00:56:10.410
but you don't fucking stop and dude's in serious shape cause he doesn't shut all

959
00:56:10.411 --> 00:56:13.740
the time.
He hunts every day.
Like he's,
his show is a hunting show.

960
00:56:13.741 --> 00:56:16.560
So he's always in fucking New Zealand climbing mountains.
He's like,

961
00:56:16.561 --> 00:56:17.970
he's constantly doing this.

962
00:56:18.030 --> 00:56:21.390
So it's like he's got this kind of hiking and Darren's,
it's a lot of work.

963
00:56:21.810 --> 00:56:24.160
But the,
the experience of doing it was

964
00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:26.620
<v 3>life changing.
You know?
That's where I got that thing from.</v>

965
00:56:26.840 --> 00:56:31.720
That's deer head right there.
How much did that doorway?
Hundred 80 pounds.

966
00:56:31.900 --> 00:56:36.400
Wow.
About approximately how long did the big um,

967
00:56:36.490 --> 00:56:39.370
I ate it pretty quick.
Um,
quite the carnivore

968
00:56:41.060 --> 00:56:43.420
eating like meat.
I just look,
I mean,

969
00:56:43.421 --> 00:56:45.940
and I'm not a cruel person and I love animals and that seems like a

970
00:56:45.941 --> 00:56:49.480
contradiction.
No it doesn't.
It's not,
people got to realize it.

971
00:56:49.750 --> 00:56:54.340
You have to manage certain amount of wildlife.
You have to for their health,

972
00:56:54.341 --> 00:56:55.570
for the health of the species,

973
00:56:55.571 --> 00:56:59.380
like the idea of deer entitled like in total,

974
00:56:59.381 --> 00:57:03.880
like the idea of large populations of deer and healthy animals breeding and

975
00:57:03.881 --> 00:57:06.370
surviving in the wild around us is a beautiful idea.

976
00:57:06.790 --> 00:57:11.170
But if you don't manage their numbers,
they just start breeding like crazy.

977
00:57:11.171 --> 00:57:14.230
And then you slam into him with cars and then they run out of food.

978
00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:16.420
They starved to death,
they started getting diseases,

979
00:57:16.421 --> 00:57:18.900
those diseases transferred to people like it's,
uh,
it,

980
00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:23.710
it really is as stewards of the land,
which is what humans claim to be,
you know,

981
00:57:23.711 --> 00:57:26.260
if we start putting fences up around things and putting roads,

982
00:57:26.440 --> 00:57:28.930
we're essentially saying,
we got this,
this is our spot.
Well,

983
00:57:28.931 --> 00:57:32.270
you need to manage that wildlife.
You have to,
you have to kill them.
You,

984
00:57:32.280 --> 00:57:34.780
your options are either kill them or reintroduced predators.

985
00:57:34.810 --> 00:57:35.710
And they've tried both.

986
00:57:35.950 --> 00:57:39.100
They reintroduced predators to Yellowstone and now they have real issues because

987
00:57:39.101 --> 00:57:42.340
of the decimation of the elk population and the deer population.

988
00:57:42.490 --> 00:57:45.400
There's like a fraction of the elk and deer that used to exist because they have

989
00:57:45.401 --> 00:57:49.150
these big packs of wolves now and they're fucking successful because they don't

990
00:57:49.151 --> 00:57:52.120
have much competition.
The grizzly bears don't know what the fuck's common,

991
00:57:52.300 --> 00:57:52.571
you know,

992
00:57:52.571 --> 00:57:54.730
and the grizzlies are not trying to eat the wolves and the wolves aren't trying

993
00:57:54.731 --> 00:57:57.400
to eat the grizzlies and occasionally have to fight over a carcass or something

994
00:57:57.401 --> 00:57:57.760
like that.

995
00:57:57.760 --> 00:58:00.190
But for the most part there's a lot of shit that they're killing out there.

996
00:58:00.310 --> 00:58:01.960
So that's,
that was one solution.

997
00:58:02.140 --> 00:58:05.080
But now a guy in Minnesota got fucking beat in the head by a wolf.

998
00:58:05.210 --> 00:58:08.890
His kid was camping the other day and this will fucking clamp to hold of his

999
00:58:08.891 --> 00:58:12.510
head and just trying to drag him away and he's screaming and you know,

1000
00:58:12.550 --> 00:58:15.910
eventually prize himself free and they find the wolf and trap it and shoot it.

1001
00:58:15.911 --> 00:58:20.380
But like that's what happens when you don't hunt deer.
When you don't hunt deer,

1002
00:58:20.440 --> 00:58:23.200
you have to have wolves.
Okay.
And if you have wolves,

1003
00:58:23.350 --> 00:58:25.930
like they're gonna kill a few people every now and again.

1004
00:58:28.060 --> 00:58:32.470
I like,
well
I like wells but I wouldn't want him in my backyard.

1005
00:58:32.530 --> 00:58:36.660
I believe in calling of herds.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You got call.
Who's going to tell?

1006
00:58:36.730 --> 00:58:39.820
So the readout of delicious Lyme disease going to call ours?

1007
00:58:40.150 --> 00:58:43.150
That's a good question.
You know what I mean?
That is the question,
right?

1008
00:58:43.210 --> 00:58:46.420
Who's going to call ours?
That's the real question.
There really is the question.

1009
00:58:46.421 --> 00:58:49.390
Because if you,
you know,
like I've said to to certain people,
like you know,

1010
00:58:49.490 --> 00:58:52.270
if everybody just had less children in the world would be a beautiful place.

1011
00:58:52.630 --> 00:58:57.220
Like is that really true?
Okay.
Because you got to look at it a few ways.
One,

1012
00:58:57.221 --> 00:59:00.160
you got to look at it and aren't people,
they started out as children.
Okay.

1013
00:59:00.161 --> 00:59:01.540
We need people like wait,

1014
00:59:01.550 --> 00:59:05.170
what we without a doubt need to manage like the amount of us we have.

1015
00:59:05.171 --> 00:59:07.360
But don't you like people like I think people are awesome.

1016
00:59:07.670 --> 00:59:10.900
Like it's operation are the ones,
I'm not a lot of good ones man.

1017
00:59:10.930 --> 00:59:13.660
I've let a lot of good ones.
Like I'm a big fan of people.

1018
00:59:13.810 --> 00:59:18.670
So when someone says that we go to overpopulation problem,
I go right,

1019
00:59:18.671 --> 00:59:22.280
how do we right now,
like it seems now if everything stays

1020
00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:23.750
<v 6>like this,
we got it.</v>

1021
00:59:23.810 --> 00:59:26.960
I saw something online that was like this little graphic thing.

1022
00:59:26.961 --> 00:59:31.040
Like when they were taking senses about like every person on the planet

1023
00:59:31.250 --> 00:59:35.570
supposedly could fit in the state of Texas and with with elbow.
Yeah,

1024
00:59:35.630 --> 00:59:38.570
I've heard that too.
So it smells like shit.
It would be a real problem.

1025
00:59:40.790 --> 00:59:44.870
There's enough room for everybody.
Resources.
That's the,
that's the question.

1026
00:59:44.871 --> 00:59:48.710
Is there enough resell location of resource and that is the question.
Scarcity,

1027
00:59:48.711 --> 00:59:49.820
the issue of scarcity.

1028
00:59:50.030 --> 00:59:52.410
I was watching something today just before I came here that,

1029
00:59:52.430 --> 00:59:53.810
you know this show modern marvel,

1030
00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:57.230
Marvel's it's always an one and they were like doing this thing about,
you know,

1031
00:59:57.231 --> 00:59:59.990
city sewers and,
and bridges and all the stuff that's falling apart.

1032
00:59:59.991 --> 01:00:02.570
And it scared the life out of me because I spend my life traveling.

1033
01:00:02.571 --> 01:00:06.200
We've guys in cars and buses and on bridges and shit like that.
So,

1034
01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:09.470
but they were showing how this in St Louis,
they're doing this thing with this,

1035
01:00:09.950 --> 01:00:13.730
they're putting these tubes down into the sewers and they're blowing them up and

1036
01:00:13.731 --> 01:00:16.100
they go all the way down the sewer and then they heat them up and there's an

1037
01:00:16.101 --> 01:00:20.630
epoxy on the outside of them and they make plastic pipes inside the old decrepit

1038
01:00:21.050 --> 01:00:25.040
and it's,
and it's like,
I see it and it's so simple and so genius and it's like,

1039
01:00:25.041 --> 01:00:25.640
man,
what,

1040
01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:30.640
who didn't think of why it took them till 2013 to figure out how to figure out

1041
01:00:30.861 --> 01:00:33.500
how to do that.
You know what I mean?
It's just weird to me.

1042
01:00:33.501 --> 01:00:35.330
Like I think that about stupid shit too.

1043
01:00:35.331 --> 01:00:38.690
Like I saw a thing on the commercial where the,
there's a plug now that we're,

1044
01:00:38.691 --> 01:00:41.810
the thing actually goes to the sides so you could put shit flat out.
I was like,

1045
01:00:41.811 --> 01:00:46.190
it took until 2013 to come up with that.
Yeah.
Well if it was up to me,

1046
01:00:46.191 --> 01:00:49.540
we would never invented scissors.
I wouldn't have it figured out.
Scissors.

1047
01:00:49.550 --> 01:00:52.410
I'd be like,
she's fucking could it.
That's the problem.

1048
01:00:53.780 --> 01:00:57.230
I'm so stupid.
I can't imagine a laptop like I know I have one.

1049
01:00:57.231 --> 01:00:58.550
I know how to press buttons on it.

1050
01:00:59.030 --> 01:01:01.430
Imagine what the fuck is going on behind the scenes,

1051
01:01:01.550 --> 01:01:06.140
but that is the wizard of Oz right there.
You laptop was the wizard of Oz.

1052
01:01:06.420 --> 01:01:08.620
Who knows what the fuck is happening behind that curtain?

1053
01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:11.670
You're just on Facebook.
Oh mg lol.

1054
01:01:14.020 --> 01:01:17.330
Oh,
you can use the camera,
Huh?
No,
I don't care who y'all shut it off.

1055
01:01:17.380 --> 01:01:21.770
I want to take,
show me beating off you.
Go ahead and get it.
You fucks.

1056
01:01:22.340 --> 01:01:26.240
No,
no.
My body image isn't that great right now,
so I keep it.

1057
01:01:28.150 --> 01:01:32.180
Well,
nobody looks good when they're coming on themselves.
That's just a fact.

1058
01:01:32.750 --> 01:01:35.630
He just don't have it looks like that's what you should've done.

1059
01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:38.270
It always looks like you could have done some other shit.

1060
01:01:38.330 --> 01:01:40.040
You put up with shit to do that.

1061
01:01:42.170 --> 01:01:45.080
It's like if you're a grown man and you have a family and you have a life to

1062
01:01:45.081 --> 01:01:46.790
live,
you have businesses to run and shit.

1063
01:01:46.791 --> 01:01:49.460
Like how much time do you have for beaten off?
So every time you do it,

1064
01:01:49.461 --> 01:01:53.390
you feel like,
what the fuck the shame was,
the fuck is wrong with me.

1065
01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:01.790
And then there's the like the,
the knowledge that you're going to do it again.

1066
01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:03.530
You know,
you know you're going to do it again.

1067
01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:07.250
Like an alcoholic who can't put that drink down.
If you're gonna do it again,

1068
01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:11.450
you'd get to do it again.
I have no shame.
I want it to last longer.
I just,

1069
01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:13.820
I love it.
Yeah.
Everybody wants to hear that right now.

1070
01:02:15.050 --> 01:02:19.110
People are throwing up in their car thinking about you beating off all of your

1071
01:02:19.111 --> 01:02:20.400
pasty,
hairy stomach.

1072
01:02:20.730 --> 01:02:24.780
<v 5>How dare you?
How dare you like Dandruff?</v>

1073
01:02:27.390 --> 01:02:31.110
Well,
it's good that they didn't fire this dude for beating off in the forest or

1074
01:02:31.111 --> 01:02:34.800
whatever the fuck happened.
It doesn't seem like a bad guy.
Just see,

1075
01:02:37.470 --> 01:02:40.720
it's called CNN gentlemen.
We don't have to shame.

1076
01:02:41.530 --> 01:02:43.650
I'm just shot Maddie.
I'm just shocked.

1077
01:02:43.651 --> 01:02:47.880
Like you get caught with a rope around your Dick and math and you have a TV job.

1078
01:02:48.090 --> 01:02:49.050
Well he could have been,

1079
01:02:49.290 --> 01:02:53.880
he might be gay and if he's gay they might be less likely to fight a big hard.

1080
01:02:53.881 --> 01:02:56.910
He played the car,
he played the game.
I'm good for him.
He got,
he did,
you know,

1081
01:02:57.090 --> 01:02:58.500
well he's like,
this is the gay community.

1082
01:02:58.501 --> 01:03:00.290
We don't have children and walk out and watch out for us.

1083
01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:04.320
So we like to do math and stick stuff up our ass.
I paid taxes.
Chose the problem.

1084
01:03:04.350 --> 01:03:08.850
Yeah.
Yeah.
There was a curfew.
That was my only my only,

1085
01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:11.460
well I think that there are different rules.

1086
01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:14.730
There's different rules for gay dudes because they're,
they're all,
they're only,

1087
01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:16.530
they only have to deal with dudes.
You know,

1088
01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:19.380
men like clearly understand the intentions of other men.

1089
01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:23.040
Whereas men like barely understand how a woman works.

1090
01:03:23.610 --> 01:03:25.350
We understand how they work through experience,

1091
01:03:25.620 --> 01:03:29.070
but like as far as the actual mechanism of thinking,
the way they think,

1092
01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:32.640
if you are thinking your in your life and living your life and you're a man,

1093
01:03:32.641 --> 01:03:36.660
it's probably virtually impossible to really understand what it's like to be a

1094
01:03:36.661 --> 01:03:37.140
woman.

1095
01:03:37.140 --> 01:03:40.740
So both of us are just like trying to coexist and figure out what's okay and not

1096
01:03:40.741 --> 01:03:44.640
okay.
What gets you smacked?
What you know,
like that's what we're doing as men,

1097
01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:49.170
but gay,
gay guys don't have to do that.
Gay guys just final hold and shove it in.

1098
01:03:49.171 --> 01:03:53.850
Just get together to do some math together and just go fucking crazy.
There's no,

1099
01:03:53.910 --> 01:03:55.920
I mean they're,
the cat has food,
you know,

1100
01:03:55.921 --> 01:03:58.920
they haven't had the food and a little ball of water.
The cat's going to be fine.

1101
01:03:58.921 --> 01:04:00.090
You don't have to feed that fucking thing.

1102
01:04:00.091 --> 01:04:05.091
And they just bought fucked for days until they run out of carbs.

1103
01:04:05.510 --> 01:04:08.890
Then they have to leave the house to go get groceries.
But that's,

1104
01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:12.870
that's all right for them.
You know,
math,
I don't think you need the groceries,

1105
01:04:12.871 --> 01:04:15.780
you know?
Well,
this guy apparently didn't have groceries with them.

1106
01:04:15.781 --> 01:04:17.450
He did have meth.
So you've got to play.

1107
01:04:19.830 --> 01:04:22.470
He's just a gay dude.
Look in the party and that's how they party.

1108
01:04:22.471 --> 01:04:25.380
They party different.
They don't make people.
It's a different experience.

1109
01:04:25.381 --> 01:04:28.530
You don't have as much responsibility when you get home and you know he's not at

1110
01:04:28.531 --> 01:04:31.040
work.
Let them do a little math.
It's like an adrenaline rush.

1111
01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:33.180
A man wants his deck,
Salk.

1112
01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:37.350
What's the problem if someone wants to do it and he wants them to do it?

1113
01:04:37.351 --> 01:04:40.470
What is the real issue?
Are we crazy?
Are We puritans here?

1114
01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:43.710
We're going back to the old days.
What's the guy do at work?
When does it work?

1115
01:04:43.711 --> 01:04:46.950
Does it keep it together?
Oh fucking whatever.
Then he's a pro.

1116
01:04:47.310 --> 01:04:50.100
Let the guy keep it together or it gets even more impressive that way.

1117
01:04:50.130 --> 01:04:53.100
Now say he's your nanny.
Well that would be an issue,

1118
01:04:57.270 --> 01:05:01.940
but he's gay though.
Guys Party and he's bought it to Joe.

1119
01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:04.680
The problem is it's a baby's involved,
so it's another human being.

1120
01:05:04.750 --> 01:05:06.510
It's a completely different than if he was an accountant.

1121
01:05:06.540 --> 01:05:09.480
I'm just totally playing devil's advocate.
You are good to good devil's advocate,

1122
01:05:09.481 --> 01:05:12.120
but there's a responsibility of a parent to take care of a child,

1123
01:05:12.121 --> 01:05:15.840
so it's irresponsible.
My answer is easy,
like get the fuck out of my house man.

1124
01:05:15.841 --> 01:05:18.730
Don't ever fucking come back.
Don't ever come back.
Sorry.

1125
01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:20.770
I have a friend who was a gay nanny.

1126
01:05:20.771 --> 01:05:24.160
He calls him a Manny and the guy's like flamboyant,

1127
01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:28.240
like nipple rings and he's a black guy and he's really flamboyant but he doesn't

1128
01:05:28.241 --> 01:05:31.390
care.
I mean my friends very open minded and the guy's not creeping anyway.

1129
01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:34.540
He's just a gay guy and he's really good at working with kids.

1130
01:05:34.541 --> 01:05:36.640
Like he's very responsible with children.

1131
01:05:36.641 --> 01:05:39.490
He sees educationally does art projects with them and they're like,

1132
01:05:39.491 --> 01:05:42.700
he does shit with his kid.
Like if,
if he's got to watch this kid for a day,

1133
01:05:42.701 --> 01:05:45.550
like for five or six hours,
there's a lot of things will happen.
Like he's like,

1134
01:05:45.700 --> 01:05:49.600
he treats it as a professional educator almost.
So it's a very unique situation.

1135
01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:52.000
So I've seen guys Flamboyan as fuck.

1136
01:05:52.300 --> 01:05:54.820
He doesn't talk about it like they don't have conversations about it.
He goes,

1137
01:05:54.821 --> 01:05:56.320
he's like,
I don't want to know.
I don't want to know.

1138
01:05:56.590 --> 01:06:01.210
But the guys out fucking all the time out there,

1139
01:06:01.220 --> 01:06:05.650
just slinging dicks in the club and then taking care of little kids all day for

1140
01:06:05.651 --> 01:06:09.850
him.
It seems to work.
I mean,
I haven't experienced this gentleman in person.

1141
01:06:09.900 --> 01:06:12.730
I don't know what his personality is like whether or not I would trust him with

1142
01:06:12.731 --> 01:06:17.280
my kids.
God bless them,
but my friend has no problem with it.
He,
he enjoys the,

1143
01:06:17.590 --> 01:06:21.640
the exchange,
but he lives in San Francisco.
This kid's going to be open minded.

1144
01:06:21.790 --> 01:06:24.250
Yeah.
My,
my buddy,
my buddy lives in San Francisco,

1145
01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:27.070
which is a completely different environment,
period.
You know,

1146
01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:31.330
so many gay people are up there.
They're undeniable.
You can't be a hater of gays.

1147
01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:35.920
Have to fucking people are going to run into her gay shit.
Hollywood though.

1148
01:06:35.950 --> 01:06:38.800
We're in the entertainment business,
man.
It's pretty good.
It's pretty good.

1149
01:06:38.890 --> 01:06:42.220
It's pretty good.
If you got a hatred for games,
you're not going to get far.
Yeah.

1150
01:06:42.221 --> 01:06:43.870
It's not a good spot.
But you know what?

1151
01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:46.720
I've been accused of having a hatred for gangs because I make fun of them,

1152
01:06:47.020 --> 01:06:50.230
but everybody gets it.
You're all gonna get it.
Anybody who is funny,

1153
01:06:50.260 --> 01:06:52.780
you do something funny,
you get it.
One,
two,
you're going to get it.

1154
01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:57.340
It's just a joke.
I'm going to get it for myself too.
I'll get it all over me.

1155
01:06:57.700 --> 01:07:02.170
You know it's fucking humor.
Like make fun of yourself.
You got to,

1156
01:07:02.910 --> 01:07:05.160
you know that's silly.
You did get,

1157
01:07:05.170 --> 01:07:09.430
can't be homophobic because you have a gay joke or a joke about how you reacted

1158
01:07:09.580 --> 01:07:14.200
to watching Brokeback mountain.
You know that's,
I react.

1159
01:07:14.201 --> 01:07:17.560
That's how I reacted.
Like I was cringing.
I was tightened up,

1160
01:07:17.950 --> 01:07:21.250
like I barely could stay at my seat when those guys were fucking in that tent.

1161
01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:26.080
I bear.
I was,
as I was thinking,
oh Jesus,
like bite on his hand.

1162
01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:30.200
Oh my God.
Janked his pants down.
Spit on his hand.

1163
01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:34.410
It was that real.
See,
I never seen it.
It was intense.

1164
01:07:34.450 --> 01:07:37.970
But I have a similar experience because Sean Penn's a pretty good buddy of mine

1165
01:07:37.971 --> 01:07:41.350
and I've seen milk,
so that was tough.
I didn't see milk.
I heard it was great,

1166
01:07:41.351 --> 01:07:44.560
but it's one of those movies it's slipped me by and I just a great film.

1167
01:07:44.561 --> 01:07:49.370
But it was like tough to watch him like make out with me.
I was like,

1168
01:07:49.460 --> 01:07:53.170
oh,
I get it.
I get it.
I get it.

1169
01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:55.780
Can you guys just fade to black,
look into each other's eyes,

1170
01:07:57.580 --> 01:08:01.440
hear birds chirping.
Masi yeah,

1171
01:08:01.450 --> 01:08:05.950
your alarm clock goes off and oh wow.
Look at the time.
Crazy.

1172
01:08:07.140 --> 01:08:07.780
Hey,

1173
01:08:07.780 --> 01:08:10.960
it's always used to trip me out cause like I used to like that show it was six

1174
01:08:10.961 --> 01:08:15.190
feet under,
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
And it was incredibly lot of gay characters in there.

1175
01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:16.240
A lot of good action.

1176
01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:18.020
<v 6>But it would always bother me because I could,</v>

1177
01:08:18.110 --> 01:08:20.650
it felt like a hot chicken and dude on the show we're going to go at it.

1178
01:08:20.660 --> 01:08:23.510
It'd be just a little thing,
but if the two dudes went at it,

1179
01:08:23.511 --> 01:08:25.030
it would be a much more long

1180
01:08:25.850 --> 01:08:29.460
<v 9>like hang around on it of,
and you know,
that's all</v>

1181
01:08:29.550 --> 01:08:32.920
<v 6>part.
But it's so true.
So true.
That's so true.</v>

1182
01:08:33.070 --> 01:08:35.590
It would be what the check they little making out a little bit.

1183
01:08:35.591 --> 01:08:38.380
Hair pulling any like,
then it would pan away to the window in it.

1184
01:08:38.530 --> 01:08:39.291
With the gay guys,

1185
01:08:39.291 --> 01:08:44.080
it's like you got like two and a half minutes and like that grunting making out

1186
01:08:44.090 --> 01:08:46.360
and then you know,
fade too.
Like,

1187
01:08:47.670 --> 01:08:52.290
<v 9>and the last thing in the studio has to show that they're progressive buy by</v>

1188
01:08:52.291 --> 01:08:53.700
showing you a lot of,

1189
01:08:53.710 --> 01:08:57.630
like [inaudible] was trying to show they're progressive,

1190
01:08:57.700 --> 01:09:00.370
<v 6>we're progressive,
we're going to show you some gay sacks,
hey,
whatever.</v>

1191
01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:03.550
And whoever was in charge of that show was more than likely there's a couple of

1192
01:09:03.551 --> 01:09:06.090
them that are gay and they'd be like,
we're fucking with everybody.
Right?

1193
01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:09.880
<v 9>Well they're making the movement that they want to see and making the movie that</v>

1194
01:09:09.881 --> 01:09:11.650
they want to see and the,
and that's their expression.

1195
01:09:11.651 --> 01:09:15.310
That's what art is all about.
Right.
You know?
But it's just saying,

1196
01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:19.720
let's do that,
let's treat it like we treat politics equal time,

1197
01:09:19.780 --> 01:09:21.610
you know what I mean?
Equal time.
That's all I'm saying.

1198
01:09:21.940 --> 01:09:25.390
But then try to balance it out like,
like affirmative action,
you know?

1199
01:09:25.391 --> 01:09:28.510
It's like they feel like gates have been held down from me all in one show.

1200
01:09:28.511 --> 01:09:31.040
You can't do it.
You can't affirmative back over.

1201
01:09:31.041 --> 01:09:34.640
Actually all I want to try to balance it back out again.

1202
01:09:35.290 --> 01:09:37.000
Let things get a little gay for awhile,

1203
01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:42.430
for a minute.
Maybe that's what's going on with overpopulation,

1204
01:09:42.431 --> 01:09:43.570
which didn't meet in it more

1205
01:09:43.630 --> 01:09:47.800
<v 6>gay people.
Just let them slam each other.
Let's get a cat man.</v>

1206
01:09:47.801 --> 01:09:49.600
You don't need a kid.
Jesus.
Nice.

1207
01:09:49.660 --> 01:09:52.000
How many people are on the four oh five so love each other.

1208
01:09:52.450 --> 01:09:57.450
That's respect to people that are here to the four oh five is moving well no

1209
01:09:57.941 --> 01:10:02.680
more.
No more babies.
Did you come to a,
to Los Angeles?

1210
01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:06.310
Um,
originally I was,
I was too young to even remember.

1211
01:10:06.311 --> 01:10:07.690
My father was a construction worker.

1212
01:10:07.691 --> 01:10:12.691
Came from the east coast during the whole like Palm Dale or Simi Valley first

1213
01:10:12.761 --> 01:10:15.130
and then Palm Dale like explosion.
Oh Wow.

1214
01:10:15.131 --> 01:10:18.760
So I came and then when I went back because things kind of went poorly for him a

1215
01:10:18.761 --> 01:10:21.140
little while and then a year or so later we came back cause he,

1216
01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:24.280
he stayed and like he was building,
like I said,
Simi Valley.

1217
01:10:24.281 --> 01:10:26.650
And so I've been here since,
you know,

1218
01:10:27.130 --> 01:10:30.240
seventies seventies wow.
So did,

1219
01:10:30.550 --> 01:10:34.870
do you remember driving on the roads back then at all?
Is it hard to remember?
No,

1220
01:10:35.010 --> 01:10:38.350
not really.
Not really hard to remember.
What was the traffic like?

1221
01:10:38.380 --> 01:10:41.620
Not Nothing compared to what it changed in,

1222
01:10:41.621 --> 01:10:45.490
in like late eighties you have go to Jerry's Deli and see those old pictures

1223
01:10:45.491 --> 01:10:49.120
that they have on the wall of like what it was like here in the 1920s and shit.

1224
01:10:49.540 --> 01:10:52.490
And you're like,
whoa.
That's why I love movies like Chinatown.

1225
01:10:52.510 --> 01:10:54.070
Like when you get to see like,
you know,

1226
01:10:54.100 --> 01:10:58.510
they're like houses in Chinatown in the valley was just orange groves and

1227
01:10:58.570 --> 01:11:03.320
fucking weird man.
It was crazy.
It shouldn't Italian Italy first,
but it's,
it's,

1228
01:11:03.410 --> 01:11:06.550
that's not that long ago on there.
Like what the fuck is happening?

1229
01:11:06.700 --> 01:11:09.850
And it's expandable.
You know why they took away all the orange groves,
right?

1230
01:11:09.851 --> 01:11:14.010
Cause they just stopped growing.
Well,
why?
Because know fucking

1231
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:15.840
<v 3>no rain,
no water.
Oh No,</v>

1232
01:11:15.841 --> 01:11:18.780
we're not gonna talk about that because it will be a whole new did open up a

1233
01:11:18.781 --> 01:11:22.580
whole can of worms.
I forgot.
I forgot.
I forgot.
But what do you owe me?

1234
01:11:23.140 --> 01:11:27.270
And you will argue about it.
Engineering has to do with radiation.

1235
01:11:27.660 --> 01:11:29.430
Oh No,
no,
no,
no.
It's don't worry.

1236
01:11:30.780 --> 01:11:32.810
You're talking about like we've had that argument already there.

1237
01:11:32.820 --> 01:11:34.770
We've had that argument.
It's not an argument man.
Look,

1238
01:11:34.771 --> 01:11:36.240
I'm no scientist and neither of you,

1239
01:11:36.241 --> 01:11:39.760
it's just what I've read from scientists date.
It's a,

1240
01:11:39.770 --> 01:11:43.760
it's a discussion about some shit that neither one of us are attached to.
No.

1241
01:11:46.170 --> 01:11:49.380
But the,
the um,
the area like,

1242
01:11:49.381 --> 01:11:52.820
like Calabasas area and shit was like ranches.
Yeah.

1243
01:11:52.910 --> 01:11:56.730
It's like a horse ranch isn't shit.
It's weird because when you go there now,

1244
01:11:56.850 --> 01:12:00.090
like the four or five all the way up to the one on one and the one on one all

1245
01:12:00.091 --> 01:12:01.820
the way through and see no and shit that thick.

1246
01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:06.920
It's thick with people fic with people every day at the amount of people that

1247
01:12:06.931 --> 01:12:07.764
live in the valley now.

1248
01:12:07.950 --> 01:12:12.780
It's just like slowly expressing itself until what does it stop?

1249
01:12:12.930 --> 01:12:16.830
I mean,
if it moves this foreign 50 fucking years,
what does it do in 500 years?

1250
01:12:16.831 --> 01:12:18.810
I mean,
is there any land left in 500 years?

1251
01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:23.010
Does anybody measured like how far like cities are spreading and what the fuck

1252
01:12:23.011 --> 01:12:25.320
happens?
And then it would just be like one of those,
what they call them,

1253
01:12:25.321 --> 01:12:29.970
mega cities like San Francisco to San Diego will just basically be,

1254
01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:32.160
that's going to suck.
It's gone.

1255
01:12:32.190 --> 01:12:36.280
There's no way to grow tomatoes when there's just nothing but people going to

1256
01:12:36.330 --> 01:12:37.830
call our herd.

1257
01:12:38.430 --> 01:12:42.870
That's how unfortunate way of looking at reality.
But it's true.

1258
01:12:44.100 --> 01:12:46.610
It's like if it,
if,
I mean,
I don't know what the,
there's,

1259
01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:50.100
there's studies that say that the more time passes,

1260
01:12:50.130 --> 01:12:54.690
the more education people receive,
the more the economy balances out,

1261
01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:59.430
the less people,
uh,
people,
less children.
People will have an Ashley,

1262
01:12:59.431 --> 01:13:03.020
they run into a problem of the population slipping.
Like,

1263
01:13:03.050 --> 01:13:06.660
I have heard that as well from people way fucking smarter than me on the
subject.

1264
01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:11.880
I loved that I couldn't be a movie that Mike Judge movie idiocracy cause it's

1265
01:13:12.361 --> 01:13:15.510
like the smart people are deciding to have less babies and have them at the

1266
01:13:15.511 --> 01:13:17.430
right time and it's like stupid people.

1267
01:13:17.431 --> 01:13:20.970
They just haven't fucking baby after baby after baby actually saying that.

1268
01:13:20.970 --> 01:13:23.550
That's like a trend in society.

1269
01:13:23.551 --> 01:13:27.030
Like that's what happens when cities start developing and people start getting

1270
01:13:27.031 --> 01:13:28.680
educated and they start getting careers.

1271
01:13:28.681 --> 01:13:31.850
They have started having kids later and later and then know literally you're

1272
01:13:31.851 --> 01:13:35.790
running into a situation where you could have like two few people like that

1273
01:13:35.791 --> 01:13:39.840
could happen in industrialized nations.
But then you've got places like China,

1274
01:13:39.870 --> 01:13:44.870
which is crazy fucked up because you have like 70% boys something not,

1275
01:13:44.971 --> 01:13:47.100
he liked that because everybody can only have one kid.

1276
01:13:47.220 --> 01:13:50.910
So everybody wants to have a boy.
So like under their boarding females,

1277
01:13:50.911 --> 01:13:53.430
I've heard all kinds of crazy shit they're doing if you have females.

1278
01:13:53.431 --> 01:13:56.130
But the fact that these poor boys are growing up in this,

1279
01:13:56.131 --> 01:13:58.260
no chicks like nobody thought that through.

1280
01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:00.090
But you're going to have more than one kid,

1281
01:14:00.091 --> 01:14:03.550
but it's like extreme luxury taxes on it.
And what was that what it is?
Yeah,

1282
01:14:03.570 --> 01:14:05.850
I'm pretty sure like you have to pay you,
you pay enough money.

1283
01:14:05.851 --> 01:14:09.450
You could have more than one kid,
but people don't have that kind of bread.

1284
01:14:09.451 --> 01:14:10.920
So they wound up only having one kid,

1285
01:14:10.990 --> 01:14:14.260
but that's even creepier like you have to pay to have another child and what

1286
01:14:14.261 --> 01:14:17.860
happens if you don't,
do you owe them?
Like what if you just have the kid?
Oh yeah,

1287
01:14:17.861 --> 01:14:19.420
no,
I saw a whole thing kind of on this.

1288
01:14:19.421 --> 01:14:23.050
I don't know if it was vice or one of those kind of like documentary ish type

1289
01:14:23.051 --> 01:14:23.861
things and it was like,
no,

1290
01:14:23.861 --> 01:14:28.120
there's a whole black market for babies and stuff in China.
It's like crazy.

1291
01:14:30.370 --> 01:14:33.250
Did you hear about that lady that had a baby inside of her body for like 20

1292
01:14:33.251 --> 01:14:38.110
years and she didn't know it and it was calcified apparently.
Yeah,
yeah,

1293
01:14:38.111 --> 01:14:41.860
yeah.
I just pulled it up.
Brian,
go to my Twitter.
It's on my Twitter.
I just a,

1294
01:14:41.861 --> 01:14:44.380
I just tweeted this,
this is the crazy.
Have you treated that?

1295
01:14:44.381 --> 01:14:46.600
Cause I think I would've paid attention.
There's some you do.
I'm like,

1296
01:14:46.601 --> 01:14:49.510
I don't care about that.
And then there's ones that I'm like,
Ooh,

1297
01:14:49.511 --> 01:14:51.100
that's very intriguing.
They read that.

1298
01:14:51.130 --> 01:14:56.130
If you go to the second one down on my Twitter woman pregnant for 46 years gives

1299
01:14:56.201 --> 01:14:59.410
birth to a mummy.
She gave birth to a calcified David,

1300
01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:03.400
one of the signs of the apocalypse or something.
Right.
It's pretty crazy,
dude.

1301
01:15:03.401 --> 01:15:06.790
That's that.
That's a baby that turned into like our calcium rock.

1302
01:15:08.820 --> 01:15:09.580
She,
uh,

1303
01:15:09.580 --> 01:15:13.360
was 26 years old and she's taken to the hospital and she was supposed to get us

1304
01:15:13.361 --> 01:15:17.570
this area in section 80.
There's 26 no,

1305
01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:21.830
no,
she for 46 years.
It was in her body.
So she was like 60.

1306
01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:27.310
No,
I was trying to do all that man.
Like you said,
46 years,

1307
01:15:27.311 --> 01:15:30.130
which she's 26 years old.
She looks 90.

1308
01:15:30.370 --> 01:15:35.370
He is a 72 at the age of 26 prior to the hospital.

1309
01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:39.670
She's the one on the right.
By the way,
she was pregnant for 20,
at 26.

1310
01:15:40.030 --> 01:15:44.020
So that was a,
that was,
that's ridiculous.

1311
01:15:44.021 --> 01:15:46.590
46 years ago.
So she's 72.
Oh Dude.

1312
01:15:46.930 --> 01:15:51.220
And she went into Labor for 48 hours with no sign of the baby.

1313
01:15:51.221 --> 01:15:53.410
So she needed to have a c section,
but she wouldn't do it.

1314
01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:56.740
So she left the hospital.
She wouldn't,
they wanted to keep the baby alive.

1315
01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:58.870
The only way to do it was a c section.
She said No.

1316
01:15:58.930 --> 01:16:03.490
So the baby died inside of her and she stayed alive and the baby never came out

1317
01:16:03.491 --> 01:16:07.210
of her box.
So it stayed inside of her body and calcified.

1318
01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:11.710
And then she's in like serious fucking pain and she,
uh,

1319
01:16:11.740 --> 01:16:15.130
goes to the hospital and they found out that she had been living with this

1320
01:16:15.131 --> 01:16:19.030
calcified baby inside of her body for 46 years.

1321
01:16:19.090 --> 01:16:20.710
Can you imagine going down on that?

1322
01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:25.230
The smell must be like a tombstone covered

1323
01:16:28.030 --> 01:16:32.590
dead babies and fit.
How do you not know that's in your fucking guts?
Yeah,
that's,

1324
01:16:32.591 --> 01:16:34.900
I mean,
it's a fetus.
So she was supposed to be,

1325
01:16:34.901 --> 01:16:39.901
have a baby and to think about how big a baby is born in the picture thing is

1326
01:16:40.330 --> 01:16:43.470
huge.
It's huge.
Yeah,
it's huge.
It's a band.

1327
01:16:44.670 --> 01:16:46.570
Well it's,
it's really sad.

1328
01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:50.320
It's really sad because the thing tried to live outside of her body.

1329
01:16:50.620 --> 01:16:52.460
They tried to,
it was passing through.

1330
01:16:52.461 --> 01:16:54.130
It couldn't get all the way through so it tried it,

1331
01:16:54.131 --> 01:16:58.780
tried to stay alive inside of her body and then her body just shut it down and

1332
01:16:58.781 --> 01:17:03.781
then just start digesting it or changing it into a calcifying yet I guess when

1333
01:17:04.751 --> 01:17:07.510
your body,
uh,
finds something foreign inside of it,

1334
01:17:07.511 --> 01:17:09.560
sometimes it'll put like little like

1335
01:17:10.390 --> 01:17:14.390
<v 6>coded in materials that it creates I guess like naturally the naturally</v>

1336
01:17:14.391 --> 01:17:15.200
occurring thing.

1337
01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:18.980
So it's think turned into somehow or another we can in a cocoon and it's like

1338
01:17:19.190 --> 01:17:19.630
this,

1339
01:17:19.630 --> 01:17:24.630
the antichrist out of it and on scientists listening to me describe that

1340
01:17:24.831 --> 01:17:27.500
probably fucking cringing right now.
And I apologize for being retarded.

1341
01:17:27.820 --> 01:17:31.220
Like snake poop.
It looks gross.
Red Becomes from

1342
01:17:33.010 --> 01:17:35.450
Brian,
shut the phone.
You just ruined the big rib for me.

1343
01:17:35.451 --> 01:17:37.430
Do you need to make ribs?

1344
01:17:38.750 --> 01:17:41.010
<v 9>Do you know why?
They were only limited edition?</v>

1345
01:17:41.340 --> 01:17:46.170
Because once in a while they actual costs of rib goes down and up like the stock

1346
01:17:46.171 --> 01:17:49.020
market and so they just buy a shitload at that time.

1347
01:17:49.220 --> 01:17:51.240
What does that even rib that wouldn't,
that is,

1348
01:17:51.241 --> 01:17:53.370
it doesn't look like it has any bones or anything.

1349
01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:57.310
<v 6>Meat.
Yeah,
it's part of that.
It's not good for you.</v>

1350
01:17:59.140 --> 01:18:00.920
It's just,
you know,

1351
01:18:00.970 --> 01:18:05.960
you can't have this many people and have like real old time barbecue places

1352
01:18:05.961 --> 01:18:09.100
would be the only place where can get some food.
It's just too many people,

1353
01:18:09.190 --> 01:18:11.530
you know?
If you want it,
you got to have some,
the way we have it set up,

1354
01:18:11.740 --> 01:18:14.250
you're going to have to have some quick food and I'm going to be able to pull
in,

1355
01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:17.290
get a stupid cheeseburger and drive off because I'm busy.

1356
01:18:17.590 --> 01:18:21.800
Or maybe that's just how they're calling the herd lot by Mcdonald's.

1357
01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:26.830
Big scandal when tinfoil hat that camouflage genics today

1358
01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:30.460
<v 9>and went there the other day and they only have two now they got rid of small.</v>

1359
01:18:30.461 --> 01:18:34.270
I'm like,
can I get small?
You know,
small meal and then they're like,

1360
01:18:34.271 --> 01:18:38.560
we only have medium and large.
Did Not small prejudice.

1361
01:18:38.850 --> 01:18:40.930
You all sizes out and it's just like,
well,

1362
01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:44.800
we only have like the big stupid extra large one now cause it's a dollar.

1363
01:18:44.801 --> 01:18:46.090
They're all dollar anyway,
so here.

1364
01:18:46.260 --> 01:18:50.460
<v 6>Yeah,
Ben men won't like small.
They don't want to buy a small boy fucking small.</v>

1365
01:18:50.490 --> 01:18:55.350
I'll buy a small,
a small,
I want a small one.
I mean it.
Whoa.

1366
01:18:55.380 --> 01:18:58.750
Geez.
By happy man,
the smarter one's buying decks.
How dairy,

1367
01:18:58.751 --> 01:19:02.730
cheeseburgers Dax in Seattle.
No one wants to buy a small cheeseburger.

1368
01:19:02.760 --> 01:19:06.080
Hendricks in Seattle.
No.
What is it?
You Ain't had to take some Seattle ever had,

1369
01:19:06.390 --> 01:19:08.970
don't need to eat a bag of dicks from Seattle.

1370
01:19:08.971 --> 01:19:11.310
A good place where there's always a line in front of it.

1371
01:19:11.311 --> 01:19:16.290
It's some sort of [inaudible] six I went there twice pass by.

1372
01:19:16.291 --> 01:19:19.710
I never went there.
I think it passed by big line both times.
It's good.

1373
01:19:19.730 --> 01:19:24.420
You know Dick,
it's Dick's.
No Dick for Joe.
I would do it.

1374
01:19:24.540 --> 01:19:26.590
I'm not scared.
I'm not scared of head.

1375
01:19:26.780 --> 01:19:29.370
You got to do it just so you can say you ate Dixon Seattle,
dude.

1376
01:19:29.670 --> 01:19:33.270
I would say I ate at Dick so I wouldn't confuse the fuck out of people taking it

1377
01:19:33.271 --> 01:19:34.590
to Thursday.
Nothing wrong with being gay,

1378
01:19:34.591 --> 01:19:36.390
but you don't have to be gay when there's no gayness.

1379
01:19:36.750 --> 01:19:39.510
I mean it's called [inaudible].
It's there.
Okay.

1380
01:19:39.550 --> 01:19:43.840
That's what you don't want to push the gay.
It doesn't bother me dude.

1381
01:19:44.120 --> 01:19:48.570
Or you do.
I'm like eight in my mind.
I made up my mind to,

1382
01:19:48.571 --> 01:19:51.720
I'm barely ate.
I'm seven.
I'm flying.
I mate,
I've got a month from like,

1383
01:19:52.410 --> 01:19:55.630
that's why you got that little homophobia about me saying you ate Dixon Seattle,

1384
01:19:55.631 --> 01:19:58.410
if you know what I mean.
If you had the dish,
don't want to confuse people.

1385
01:19:59.670 --> 01:20:02.490
It's all a domino rare.
It's got my favorite line.

1386
01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:04.620
You think people would really get confused?
Joe

1387
01:20:07.120 --> 01:20:10.170
got Joe kits for eating.
Dom Irrera has the best line about that.
He goes,

1388
01:20:10.171 --> 01:20:12.780
I wish I was gay just so I could come out of closet.

1389
01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:16.440
That's how much I give a fuck.
You think I really do.
I wish I was gay.

1390
01:20:16.441 --> 01:20:17.760
I wish I could tell people I was gay

1391
01:20:19.350 --> 01:20:22.890
and he's not lying when he says it.
You know,
he's a dude,

1392
01:20:22.891 --> 01:20:27.690
has lived a long ass life.
He just,
he gives zero fucks.
Yeah,
he's awesome.

1393
01:20:27.750 --> 01:20:32.580
It's so funny when he says that too.
I wish I was gay.
He's,
he's totally serious.

1394
01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:35.400
Totally sober.
It gives zero fucks.

1395
01:20:37.320 --> 01:20:40.530
Well,
I think it's almost like an intelligence test.

1396
01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:44.190
If you really give a fuck that someone's gay,
it's like,
I would like to see that.

1397
01:20:44.191 --> 01:20:48.750
Just so I know who's stupid.
You know,
like who's blaring out?
Who's,
who's angry?

1398
01:20:48.751 --> 01:20:52.560
Who's,
who's,
who's holding up the god hates fags signs.
Like I just,

1399
01:20:52.610 --> 01:20:53.970
I want to know where you are.
Just like,

1400
01:20:54.370 --> 01:20:57.330
cause most of them are pro gay themselves and just scared of it.

1401
01:20:57.330 --> 01:21:01.200
You know what I mean?
Terrified inside that they're gay.
Huge number.
Huge number.

1402
01:21:01.500 --> 01:21:04.750
Huge number of hypocritical fuck heads.
I think it's like a,

1403
01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:07.660
like they think they're gonna throw people off.
Like he's gay.

1404
01:21:07.661 --> 01:21:08.730
He's got a problem with these gay,

1405
01:21:08.940 --> 01:21:12.010
Billy would never say that if he was actually gay.
You know what I'm telling you?

1406
01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:13.590
Okay,
let's talk to my cock

1407
01:21:17.820 --> 01:21:18.750
for whatever reason.

1408
01:21:18.751 --> 01:21:21.600
But it's a weird thing when you find out that people are hating on gays and then

1409
01:21:21.601 --> 01:21:23.700
they do gay shit.
Like the Ted Haggard thing.

1410
01:21:23.701 --> 01:21:26.140
I remember that that was that big case where the guy was like,

1411
01:21:26.670 --> 01:21:31.140
he had like a fucking,
like a sports stadium filled with people every weekend.

1412
01:21:31.410 --> 01:21:35.970
Like a mega church guy.
Those mega church dudes are scary.

1413
01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:41.370
And all those dudes that control those gigantic huge ass fucking arena is filled

1414
01:21:41.371 --> 01:21:45.090
with people.
If you ever watched some of those on TV,
yes sir.
Whew.

1415
01:21:45.690 --> 01:21:49.140
He's the guy who got caught with like,
he got the math too and like a hotel room,

1416
01:21:49.141 --> 01:21:50.250
like yeah.
Isn't he on like,

1417
01:21:50.251 --> 01:21:53.190
there's a crazy like documentary on HBO where they have like the school where

1418
01:21:53.191 --> 01:21:57.360
they're like preparing like youngsters for like Christian Jihad.

1419
01:21:57.361 --> 01:22:00.380
Like they're like,
you're talking about a different thing,
but I know what you're,

1420
01:22:00.381 --> 01:22:04.140
that guy was involved in it before the scandal and I think yes,
he was.
Yes,

1421
01:22:04.141 --> 01:22:07.880
he was.
Yeah,
you're right.
You're right.
Um,
what is the name of that?
Uh,

1422
01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:10.050
that documentary.
I got it on my iTunes.

1423
01:22:10.051 --> 01:22:14.410
The same chick who did the followed around the president's for Hbo did,
did,
did,

1424
01:22:14.411 --> 01:22:18.820
did the thing,
I forget what it's called.
She love all that stuff.
Document.

1425
01:22:18.821 --> 01:22:20.100
I hate when I can't remember.

1426
01:22:20.730 --> 01:22:24.130
I'm so stupid and Y'all telling me I threw out a website here once and it of

1427
01:22:24.260 --> 01:22:28.440
like crashed because no doubt that definitely happens.
Yeah.

1428
01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:32.130
Goddammit.
Like the pump site to buy your new CD.

1429
01:22:32.550 --> 01:22:34.410
Who was sure who was in this movie?

1430
01:22:35.430 --> 01:22:36.263
<v 10>Ah,</v>

1431
01:22:37.290 --> 01:22:41.620
<v 6>in the movie?
Yeah.
Who to,
who created it.
Do you have any idea man?
A documentary.</v>

1432
01:22:43.820 --> 01:22:44.420
She's really,

1433
01:22:44.420 --> 01:22:48.430
she's like the daughter of somebody in Congress or something like that.

1434
01:22:48.431 --> 01:22:51.340
I almost want to say like Nancy Pelosi's daughter or something like that,

1435
01:22:51.341 --> 01:22:55.300
but I don't think that's right.
Yeah,
it might.
It's something,

1436
01:22:55.301 --> 01:23:00.220
it might be because I think it's something Pelosi,
Oh man,
you're killing me.

1437
01:23:02.070 --> 01:23:02.820
<v 10>Yeah,</v>

1438
01:23:02.820 --> 01:23:06.100
<v 6>it's,
that's the stoner reached dude.
That's the stoner Google</v>

1439
01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:08.950
<v 3>right there.
In my mind,
I'm trying to remember this fucking movie.</v>

1440
01:23:08.951 --> 01:23:12.730
If anybody hears this and they know what the fuck was someone screaming right

1441
01:23:12.731 --> 01:23:16.840
now somebody's saying,
oh,
I usually have it on my laptop,

1442
01:23:16.841 --> 01:23:19.690
but this is a new laptop.
I don't even have it on here.
It's,
it's,

1443
01:23:19.810 --> 01:23:24.490
it's one of my favorite movies about Camp Jesus camp camp.

1444
01:23:26.200 --> 01:23:27.610
I had to remember,
thank God,

1445
01:23:28.030 --> 01:23:31.810
thank God he's just one of my favorite like crazy people movies,
Jesus camps,

1446
01:23:31.811 --> 01:23:34.780
a brilliant movie.
And they did it scary.
Yeah.

1447
01:23:34.781 --> 01:23:37.120
And they did it like they just showed you what was going on.

1448
01:23:37.270 --> 01:23:39.280
I mean that's what they did.
They just showed you what was going on.

1449
01:23:39.281 --> 01:23:42.820
They didn't give you any editorial flair to it.
No narration.

1450
01:23:43.060 --> 01:23:46.000
They just show you what these people feel like they're doing and how they need

1451
01:23:46.001 --> 01:23:50.110
to raise Christians in the same way these jihadis are being raised,
you know,

1452
01:23:50.111 --> 01:23:52.680
I mean this woman compares suicide bombers,
you know,

1453
01:23:52.690 --> 01:23:53.910
and that they're starting them off young.

1454
01:23:53.910 --> 01:23:56.710
So we need to start our Christian warriors off cause they're right.

1455
01:23:56.890 --> 01:24:00.120
This is actually the swamps there at fucking Cobra.

1456
01:24:00.121 --> 01:24:04.060
Raisie the shit they say to these little kids and the founder of the whole thing

1457
01:24:04.061 --> 01:24:06.550
was that guy.
Yes he was a big part of it.

1458
01:24:08.490 --> 01:24:13.030
The organization.
It is,
it is.
It's just,
it doesn't get labeled as one,
you know,

1459
01:24:13.060 --> 01:24:15.820
I mean the Jesus,
Jesus,
cause they haven't done anything yet.

1460
01:24:15.850 --> 01:24:20.110
When one of those kids does something 10 years from now,
well that that camp,

1461
01:24:20.140 --> 01:24:23.560
that whole thing like conservative Christians were against it.

1462
01:24:23.710 --> 01:24:26.500
Like radio hosts who are Christian who are conservative.

1463
01:24:26.650 --> 01:24:28.420
They were like this is indoctrination.

1464
01:24:28.421 --> 01:24:31.420
Like this isn't like what you're doing is you're,
you're making radicals.

1465
01:24:31.421 --> 01:24:35.200
You're not educating them about God and about love and about the,
the,
you know,

1466
01:24:35.220 --> 01:24:39.130
the,
what's the Bible says you guys,
you're making like soldiers for Christ.

1467
01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:43.540
Admittedly.
So conservative Christians were like,

1468
01:24:43.541 --> 01:24:46.510
you guys are going to fucking far but these idiots,

1469
01:24:46.511 --> 01:24:50.890
their idea was that if the jihad is do it and what they believe in is wrong,

1470
01:24:50.980 --> 01:24:54.760
we should do the same thing cause we're right.
And you're like Whoa,

1471
01:24:54.790 --> 01:24:58.570
that's some fucking logic right there.
And they're allowed to raise kids.

1472
01:24:58.900 --> 01:25:03.280
It's a brilliant movie.
Yeah,
check it out.
They,
so they closed down that ministry.

1473
01:25:03.940 --> 01:25:06.730
Good.
They closed down because of this,
because of this movement.

1474
01:25:06.731 --> 01:25:09.130
Because it's like,
this wasn't even something that Christians wanted.

1475
01:25:09.430 --> 01:25:12.240
This was just like,
like you guys gotta fucking take it down a notch.

1476
01:25:12.241 --> 01:25:14.620
She didn't make it.
Who was the person that made it?
Uh,

1477
01:25:14.621 --> 01:25:18.460
the director's name is,
uh,
it's two people.

1478
01:25:18.461 --> 01:25:22.970
Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady there.
That was wrong.
I was wrong about whom?

1479
01:25:23.030 --> 01:25:26.320
Anytime.
Yeah.
And they're the also the producers.
It's just fucking brilliant.

1480
01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:28.960
They did an awesome job with it.
Yeah.

1481
01:25:28.961 --> 01:25:32.080
That's scared me when I saw that the first time.
All right.
Well it's,
you know,

1482
01:25:32.081 --> 01:25:35.350
when you,
when you realize how easy it is to shape a child's mind,

1483
01:25:35.740 --> 01:25:37.960
it becomes really scary because of that.
But how many,

1484
01:25:38.020 --> 01:25:41.680
how many likeminded people said that's a good idea and started their own little

1485
01:25:41.681 --> 01:25:44.290
version of that somewhere.
You know what I mean?
Sure.
I mean,

1486
01:25:44.291 --> 01:25:47.080
how many people are homeschooling their kid because they want the kid to be

1487
01:25:47.081 --> 01:25:49.050
nutty and not influenced by the,
the,

1488
01:25:49.051 --> 01:25:52.330
the ridiculous Dems and libs are teaching in school.
You know,

1489
01:25:52.331 --> 01:25:54.730
there's a lot of people out there doing that.
Less science,

1490
01:25:54.880 --> 01:25:58.780
not exposing their children to other ideologies because they're worried that it

1491
01:25:58.781 --> 01:26:03.070
might catch,
you know,
not treating your child as if it's a growing person.

1492
01:26:03.170 --> 01:26:07.040
Exposing them to and finding what their groove is.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

1493
01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:09.200
We're going to sit down in this kitchen table.

1494
01:26:09.201 --> 01:26:12.980
I'm going to teach you about the Lord.
All this shit about evolution's bullshit.

1495
01:26:12.981 --> 01:26:16.370
Okay.
There's never been a single piece of evidence points Earth being more than

1496
01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:20.810
10,000 years old.
That's exactly what the Bible says as well as people,
you know,

1497
01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:23.300
fucking learn that shit and then you get to,
Paul's were there,

1498
01:26:23.450 --> 01:26:27.440
they did a Gallup poll that said 50% 46% of America believes the earth is less

1499
01:26:27.441 --> 01:26:31.790
than 10,000 years old.
Wow.
That's real.
Wow,

1500
01:26:32.530 --> 01:26:35.780
that's,
that's real.
So that's like,

1501
01:26:36.410 --> 01:26:38.960
I don't know how long that's going to be around for.

1502
01:26:39.140 --> 01:26:43.610
I have a feeling that as Internet access gets to more and more places and more

1503
01:26:43.611 --> 01:26:44.540
people get educated,

1504
01:26:44.570 --> 01:26:48.170
that kind of thinking it's probably going to go away within the next 2030 years.

1505
01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:50.030
I really don't see how you can keep it up.

1506
01:26:50.180 --> 01:26:52.040
It just seems to be at a certain point in time,

1507
01:26:52.190 --> 01:26:56.000
we're going to invent some sort of technology that's even more pervasive than

1508
01:26:56.001 --> 01:26:59.300
just looking things up.
Just looking things up in a computer.

1509
01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:01.520
No one ever thought of that for 500 years ago.

1510
01:27:01.521 --> 01:27:04.520
No one ever thought that'd be possible to us.
This is every day occurrence.

1511
01:27:04.670 --> 01:27:07.880
I think he's going to be a next step in the evolution of technology that's gonna

1512
01:27:07.881 --> 01:27:10.540
allow you to access information without actually looking things up.

1513
01:27:10.541 --> 01:27:12.920
You gonna be able to just get it in your head,
however,

1514
01:27:13.010 --> 01:27:16.910
show it somehow in your head and when that happens is not going to be any room

1515
01:27:16.911 --> 01:27:19.130
for this shit.
You can,
was it?
Was it,

1516
01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:24.290
were we having the conversation about [inaudible] Kurtzweil exactly.

1517
01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:25.153
The curse word.

1518
01:27:25.670 --> 01:27:28.870
Tell them when we were talking about transcendent man and document,

1519
01:27:29.150 --> 01:27:32.990
just talking about how like a technology evolves exponentially rather than

1520
01:27:32.991 --> 01:27:36.740
linearly and how like pretty soon we're going to have nano technology and all

1521
01:27:36.770 --> 01:27:39.440
that whole conversation.
I interviewed him for my Scifi show.

1522
01:27:39.740 --> 01:27:42.190
I got to talk to him for over an hour.
It was fucking awesome.

1523
01:27:42.230 --> 01:27:45.560
She's crazy amazing because it's math.
Well,

1524
01:27:45.561 --> 01:27:50.561
he's also predicted everything he predicted the search engine way before it

1525
01:27:50.991 --> 01:27:53.180
existed.
He predicted the Internet before it existed.

1526
01:27:53.570 --> 01:27:56.120
He created voice recognition software.
I mean this,

1527
01:27:56.121 --> 01:27:58.520
this motherfucker's been around for a long time.

1528
01:27:58.550 --> 01:28:02.300
Breaking down what's happening as far as like technological trends and makes

1529
01:28:02.301 --> 01:28:06.200
great keyboards to you.
Does he makes me,
isn't that incredible?
I mean,

1530
01:28:06.201 --> 01:28:07.520
he's just like a super genius.

1531
01:28:07.650 --> 01:28:12.430
He's also made like a ebook software for laptops and you know,

1532
01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:17.270
saw him.
Uh,
he,
we advance things.
He's like invented a bunch of different shit.

1533
01:28:17.320 --> 01:28:21.560
It's just a constantly thinking super genius type character and picking his

1534
01:28:21.561 --> 01:28:22.370
brain.

1535
01:28:22.370 --> 01:28:26.060
It's not like picking the brain of just some average asshole who's gonna like

1536
01:28:26.061 --> 01:28:28.130
tie some shitty read on scientific America.

1537
01:28:28.370 --> 01:28:31.670
This is a guy who's actually making these discoveries.

1538
01:28:31.910 --> 01:28:36.020
This is a guy who's actually been involved in many technological innovations

1539
01:28:36.021 --> 01:28:40.220
that have really benefited people in a big leap and he's telling you about the

1540
01:28:40.221 --> 01:28:45.140
future and you're like,
oh,
leash call from like a fear of death too.
He's like,

1541
01:28:45.170 --> 01:28:47.360
really?
He doesn't want to die.
He wants to live forever.

1542
01:28:47.361 --> 01:28:50.360
He wants to bring his dad back.
Yeah,
he wants to bring his dad back.

1543
01:28:50.361 --> 01:28:54.740
How crazy is that?
The vitamins and all that like,
well,

1544
01:28:54.741 --> 01:28:58.190
he thinks that we're going to get to a certain point in time where you are not

1545
01:28:58.191 --> 01:29:02.730
going to be a a single autonomous body function thing.

1546
01:29:02.850 --> 01:29:06.630
You're not going to be a single body like a flesh and bone blood.

1547
01:29:06.660 --> 01:29:07.441
You're not going to be that.

1548
01:29:07.441 --> 01:29:11.280
You're going to be a combination of tissue and artificial creations,

1549
01:29:11.460 --> 01:29:15.870
whether it's artificial blood cells or,
and then if the guy had already him,
yeah,

1550
01:29:15.871 --> 01:29:18.750
you are with your heart.
It's true for folks who don't know,

1551
01:29:18.751 --> 01:29:22.920
Everlast had a hard situation when they put a titanium heart valve and he goes

1552
01:29:22.921 --> 01:29:26.010
like,
tick,
tick,
tick,
tick,
tick,
tick,
tick,
tick.
It's fucking wild man.

1553
01:29:26.011 --> 01:29:29.490
So you're living proof and bionic and what he's saying is that this is just one

1554
01:29:29.491 --> 01:29:34.410
step and that in the future you're going to have a better version of your body.

1555
01:29:34.411 --> 01:29:35.244
Then your body,

1556
01:29:35.890 --> 01:29:38.730
they're going to be able to figure out how to get your consciousness into this

1557
01:29:38.731 --> 01:29:43.731
super body is Wolverine Adam hard-drives skeleton bone fucking out of your

1558
01:29:45.031 --> 01:29:45.864
knuckles.

1559
01:29:46.040 --> 01:29:46.161
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

1560
01:29:46.161 --> 01:29:51.161
That's comments basically into a hard drive and download your consciousness into

1561
01:29:52.911 --> 01:29:53.220
a hard,
yeah,

1562
01:29:53.220 --> 01:29:56.400
<v 3>drive the guy's theory.
It's basically you're going to live forever.</v>

1563
01:29:56.430 --> 01:29:57.510
He gets criticized though.

1564
01:29:57.511 --> 01:30:00.240
We should say a lot of people say you're never going to be able to download

1565
01:30:00.241 --> 01:30:01.350
consciousness,
no hard drive.

1566
01:30:01.351 --> 01:30:05.460
They say that the human personality is so complex and based on so many different

1567
01:30:05.461 --> 01:30:07.590
factors like the like how many,

1568
01:30:07.680 --> 01:30:11.220
how much hormones when your system at a certain time,
what stress level,

1569
01:30:11.260 --> 01:30:13.640
you wonder how much cortisone where you getting from it.

1570
01:30:13.670 --> 01:30:18.670
There's a lot of shit involved about like trying to develop a human being from

1571
01:30:19.201 --> 01:30:22.880
scratch to an adult.
So many steps take place.
So the,

1572
01:30:23.090 --> 01:30:26.340
the idea that you could actually recreate that and have anything is enjoyable as

1573
01:30:26.341 --> 01:30:29.190
a person.
It's tough to believe.
It's tough to believe.
I mean,

1574
01:30:29.191 --> 01:30:34.191
I guess if you could mathematically calculate how many bad times you,

1575
01:30:34.231 --> 01:30:39.030
you want to inject into a person's consciousness and memory and then create them

1576
01:30:39.060 --> 01:30:41.220
over like a gigantic,
you know,

1577
01:30:41.221 --> 01:30:44.310
computer process where you're like literally inventing memories,

1578
01:30:44.420 --> 01:30:49.370
algorithms all there to give them an adaptive technology,
you know,

1579
01:30:49.470 --> 01:30:53.010
that allows them to pretend to have lived a rich and wonderful life.

1580
01:30:53.160 --> 01:30:55.740
And then you get like this really wise old dude,

1581
01:30:55.741 --> 01:31:00.480
but really someone who made them in a lab and it only took an hour and they pop

1582
01:31:00.481 --> 01:31:04.260
open the metal top and he comes out all steamy and shit and just dropping

1583
01:31:04.261 --> 01:31:08.200
science on you with his fake brain.
Yeah.
But with no bad experience,

1584
01:31:08.230 --> 01:31:12.510
no bad experiences,
total poser.
How fun is that going to be?

1585
01:31:13.030 --> 01:31:16.680
<v 6>Maybe it'd be amazing.
Maybe he'll be like,
fucking doctor Manhattan.</v>

1586
01:31:16.700 --> 01:31:20.080
He'll be so domain,
most interesting man in the world.

1587
01:31:20.100 --> 01:31:21.110
But you have fucked the dose.

1588
01:31:22.380 --> 01:31:25.130
I never told you my story about him that Doseck he's got,
yeah.

1589
01:31:25.510 --> 01:31:30.260
Did you meet him at the dude?
He's like five foot one,
like short,

1590
01:31:30.550 --> 01:31:32.650
maybe five foot four or something like that.
He's like little dude,

1591
01:31:32.860 --> 01:31:37.590
his name is like something like very Jewish.
It was like something like,

1592
01:31:38.020 --> 01:31:40.600
yeah.
And he told me he worked at a,
at a,
at a,

1593
01:31:40.601 --> 01:31:44.560
at a hardware store on Lincoln in Venice.

1594
01:31:45.070 --> 01:31:46.630
He probably doesn't anymore because of the gang.

1595
01:31:46.631 --> 01:31:48.970
That's what I think where he was working when they,
when he got the gang.

1596
01:31:49.330 --> 01:31:52.850
But that's not even his voice too.
Oh that's hilarious.
So it,

1597
01:31:53.560 --> 01:31:57.970
but I don't always drink beer.
That's not his voice.
Dude.
I would drink.

1598
01:31:58.090 --> 01:32:00.070
Don't sick.
He's my friends stay

1599
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:04.300
<v 9>thirsty.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But those Swedish guy,
I'm not saying anything bad about him,</v>

1600
01:32:04.301 --> 01:32:06.180
but he was like,
we were,
they came here to the stories.

1601
01:32:06.220 --> 01:32:08.050
We were playing in the playboy mansion for some,

1602
01:32:08.350 --> 01:32:11.380
some like charity event and like they come back to the bad seasons.
Like Yo,

1603
01:32:11.381 --> 01:32:14.270
the most interesting man here is in the world is here and he'd like to meet you

1604
01:32:14.271 --> 01:32:17.280
all.
And we were always loved those corners.
We were the clown on him.
I was like,

1605
01:32:17.281 --> 01:32:20.380
so we were like,
oh fuck yeah,
he's got to come back here.
I mean,
it's on Facebook.

1606
01:32:20.381 --> 01:32:22.090
We got pictures of it.
Wow.

1607
01:32:22.180 --> 01:32:24.640
But he comes in and we're all taking all these pictures and he's like,
yeah,

1608
01:32:24.641 --> 01:32:25.474
Hey guys,

1609
01:32:28.380 --> 01:32:32.410
I'm Leo Feinstein.
There's literally something like that.
I'm being,
you know,

1610
01:32:32.411 --> 01:32:37.100
that wasn't exactly that,
but it was so like,
oh,
someone should overdub.

1611
01:32:37.130 --> 01:32:39.760
And I was just like,
I was just like,
man,
if that was me,

1612
01:32:39.761 --> 01:32:43.600
I would be milking that to the nth degree,
man.
I would walk in and be like,

1613
01:32:43.601 --> 01:32:47.310
my friends at least fake it is

1614
01:32:47.840 --> 01:32:51.260
<v 3>Marshall or the bunch of hot chicks like that and like a yacht and none of</v>

1615
01:32:51.261 --> 01:32:55.490
Ferrari and drinking and mountain climbing and you go somewhere and people just

1616
01:32:55.491 --> 01:32:56.720
would just gravitate towards you.

1617
01:32:56.900 --> 01:32:59.330
That's the dude went all the cool shit in that show.

1618
01:32:59.650 --> 01:33:02.950
<v 9>You gotta be like,
you gotta be that guy.
My friends,
it wasn't that.</v>

1619
01:33:02.951 --> 01:33:07.450
It was like this little Guy [inaudible] guys,
how you doing?
Hey,

1620
01:33:07.930 --> 01:33:11.140
you want to have a drink?
Maybe he needs to maybe needs to change it.

1621
01:33:11.320 --> 01:33:13.160
Maybe it needs to bring it back and then when,

1622
01:33:13.161 --> 01:33:15.010
when when I saw the commercial that night,

1623
01:33:15.250 --> 01:33:18.430
that night I got home from the Gig and then came a commercial came on and then,

1624
01:33:18.431 --> 01:33:20.990
and I realized the voice was overdubbed.
I was like,
Oh man,

1625
01:33:21.580 --> 01:33:24.610
it doesn't seem like it.
It Joe got it.
Joe got it right there.

1626
01:33:24.700 --> 01:33:26.320
It seems really hilarious.

1627
01:33:29.040 --> 01:33:31.720
Wow.
There's a picture of him.
Oh my goodness.

1628
01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:39.040
Yeah.
Is that what everybody,
yeah,
it's this one little guy.

1629
01:33:39.340 --> 01:33:42.820
Yeah.
It seems like a nice guy though.
Nice,
Super Nice Guy.

1630
01:33:42.850 --> 01:33:44.260
I'm not even trying to throw him under the bus.

1631
01:33:44.261 --> 01:33:46.810
It was just one of the things we were so pumped and it was just like kind of one

1632
01:33:46.811 --> 01:33:49.340
of those let downs where you're like,
oh man,

1633
01:33:49.940 --> 01:33:50.810
<v 3>very that personally,</v>

1634
01:33:50.811 --> 01:33:55.020
if people think that when they meet me like they go short as fuck dude.
I'm like,

1635
01:33:55.050 --> 01:33:56.910
Oh,
this is what I am sorry.

1636
01:33:57.100 --> 01:34:00.370
<v 9>Put them in a yoke.
Like,
Hey,
what was that clip I saw you like,
what was it?</v>

1637
01:34:00.371 --> 01:34:03.280
Fear factor where you like put a guy in a yolk and like one of the contestants.

1638
01:34:03.370 --> 01:34:05.540
<v 3>Yeah,
I thought he was gonna hit me.
He was a guy,</v>

1639
01:34:06.070 --> 01:34:09.250
he had a little bit of a history of violence.
He had on one show,

1640
01:34:09.251 --> 01:34:12.190
he thrown his wife down and another show he had attack a counselor.

1641
01:34:12.370 --> 01:34:16.090
So they'd actually warned me about him before he did the show.
And uh,

1642
01:34:16.120 --> 01:34:21.040
his wife came back from a stunt and hit a guy and I told her,
I go,
hey,

1643
01:34:21.041 --> 01:34:21.221
you know,

1644
01:34:21.221 --> 01:34:23.160
cause they would yell at each other and screaming at each other and shit,
man,

1645
01:34:23.230 --> 01:34:26.300
he was a really embarrassing,
like,
you fucking idiot.
It's right there.

1646
01:34:26.301 --> 01:34:29.440
I go fucking get screaming at each other.
And so,
um,

1647
01:34:29.620 --> 01:34:32.770
one of the dudes on the show was heckling them while they were competing.

1648
01:34:32.771 --> 01:34:35.860
And so the woman comes back and punches the dude who's heckling her,

1649
01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:40.180
like punches and renting.
Somebody's really hard.
And so I go,
hey,
you can't,
I go,

1650
01:34:40.181 --> 01:34:42.220
just because you hit your husband doesn't mean you can go around hitting other

1651
01:34:42.221 --> 01:34:44.350
people.
Like you can't hit other contestants.

1652
01:34:44.650 --> 01:34:48.090
And then the husband gets in my face and I was like,
I saw that.
I saw that,

1653
01:34:48.100 --> 01:34:50.010
pushed him away.
A couple of that,
they didn't show all of it.

1654
01:34:50.040 --> 01:34:52.900
I pushed him away a couple of times and it kept getting closer to me and I was

1655
01:34:52.901 --> 01:34:55.000
like,
this guy's going to do,
this is going to escalate,

1656
01:34:55.001 --> 01:34:55.900
so I'm just going to grab them.

1657
01:34:55.930 --> 01:34:59.130
So just grabbed the back of his neck and it just felt like,
I felt like if he,

1658
01:34:59.630 --> 01:35:00.380
first of all,

1659
01:35:00.380 --> 01:35:03.170
he's going to feel this like to get ragdolled and he's not going to like that

1660
01:35:03.171 --> 01:35:05.390
and second,
and maybe that'll calm him down if I don't do anything to him.

1661
01:35:05.540 --> 01:35:08.690
So I just grabbed his head and I just held onto them a little bit that way.
Also,

1662
01:35:08.691 --> 01:35:12.260
if he hits me,
I'm just going to smash him.
Just draw one knee on him.
Yeah,

1663
01:35:12.380 --> 01:35:13.820
you're holding a hunt a guy's head.

1664
01:35:13.821 --> 01:35:17.000
You basically own them like you've watched Anderson Silva fight rich Franklin.

1665
01:35:17.240 --> 01:35:18.073
He holds his head.

1666
01:35:18.110 --> 01:35:21.740
When a guy that can clamp down on the back of your head and you can't get those

1667
01:35:21.741 --> 01:35:25.490
arms off,
that's a terrible position to be in the clear,
that's the Overeem.

1668
01:35:25.670 --> 01:35:29.320
They changed k one because of Alistair Overeem.
Bullock county because yeah,

1669
01:35:29.340 --> 01:35:31.710
bull cow.
Perfect example.
K One was like,
you know what man,

1670
01:35:31.730 --> 01:35:34.670
you can't be holding people's heads because in would just bum rush.

1671
01:35:34.671 --> 01:35:38.570
You grabbed the back of your head and it's night night,
boom,
boom.

1672
01:35:38.660 --> 01:35:41.420
You can't get them off you.
You can't get them off of the back of your neck.

1673
01:35:41.500 --> 01:35:45.290
He's huge arms.
He's got that fucking locked down grip where they just,

1674
01:35:45.350 --> 01:35:49.040
there's dudes who develop that fucking tightness to that hold where they slapped

1675
01:35:49.041 --> 01:35:50.210
that motherfucker on the back of your head.

1676
01:35:50.210 --> 01:35:53.390
Then they pinched down with the two forearms and you're fucked man,

1677
01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:54.740
and then the knees are coming.

1678
01:35:55.040 --> 01:35:57.890
Why can't he get it going like that and then you have seen there's a lot of

1679
01:35:57.891 --> 01:36:01.790
issues.
One,
okay.
First of all,
he's taken a lot of head punishment.

1680
01:36:02.060 --> 01:36:06.240
If you watch Alistair Overeem's k one career has his pride career,
the,

1681
01:36:06.280 --> 01:36:09.290
the strike force fights in Strikeforce.
Force is really,
really didn't get hit,

1682
01:36:09.470 --> 01:36:13.190
but he's had some brutal knockouts.
Chocolate.
Dell knocked him out.
Keratan off,

1683
01:36:13.191 --> 01:36:17.060
knocked him out.
Shogun knocked him out.
A lot of guys knocked out.
He finished it.

1684
01:36:17.390 --> 01:36:20.030
We finished him.
He got finished in kickbox abouts.
He finished.

1685
01:36:20.031 --> 01:36:21.870
Bought her heart too.
Yeah.
Any finished Baader too.

1686
01:36:22.280 --> 01:36:24.530
He's been stopped a bunch of times now.

1687
01:36:24.531 --> 01:36:29.450
He's been stopped twice in a row and the big foot one was fucking trauma.

1688
01:36:29.810 --> 01:36:32.810
That big foot one was incredible.
That combination,

1689
01:36:32.990 --> 01:36:35.450
there's only been one combination is good as that.

1690
01:36:35.451 --> 01:36:40.250
Finishing a fire with hands and that's Phil baroni versus Dave and a old school

1691
01:36:40.251 --> 01:36:44.990
UFC.
Have you ever seen that?
Pull that shit up.
Phil Baroni versus day Benet.

1692
01:36:44.991 --> 01:36:47.690
Phil Baroni is uh,
he,
you know,

1693
01:36:47.691 --> 01:36:52.010
he's a dude who like really underrated punching power.
Like people don't know.

1694
01:36:52.011 --> 01:36:54.490
He's had a lot of issues.
He's been in the game a long time.

1695
01:36:54.491 --> 01:36:58.940
It's had a lot of injuries,
had a lot of losses.
But when Phil Baroni clips you,

1696
01:36:59.060 --> 01:37:02.930
you got big problems because that is dynamic.

1697
01:37:02.990 --> 01:37:06.410
And this series of punches that he landed on Monday to finish him,

1698
01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:11.330
one of the best all time Kao scenes I've ever seen in my life.

1699
01:37:11.570 --> 01:37:13.820
Look at this combination.
Boom,
boom,
boom.

1700
01:37:14.060 --> 01:37:17.120
That's the slow mo show that like the full speed version.
If you can find,

1701
01:37:17.121 --> 01:37:19.040
that's a shitty version of it too.
That looks terrible.

1702
01:37:19.100 --> 01:37:22.100
It's like a Vito Belfort and see if he could find like a better version of it so

1703
01:37:22.101 --> 01:37:24.530
you could really see it clearly because it's so,
but,

1704
01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:28.220
but the big foot one was really similar,
real similar,
real close.

1705
01:37:28.610 --> 01:37:30.830
So it's like that's a lot of trauma man.

1706
01:37:30.831 --> 01:37:33.990
I think your brain needs a long time off after you get fucked up.

1707
01:37:34.010 --> 01:37:37.850
Like Brown just touched him on the chin with that foot and it was,
yeah.

1708
01:37:37.851 --> 01:37:39.770
And that was really the only time Brown,
he really hit him,

1709
01:37:39.771 --> 01:37:43.870
clean it up to that point.
And you know,
Allister almost finished him,

1710
01:37:44.090 --> 01:37:48.170
almost finished them and he went out full clip to try to finish him,

1711
01:37:48.440 --> 01:37:52.640
which if you do,
it puts you in a real bad position.
Gas Tank wise.

1712
01:37:52.910 --> 01:37:54.260
And when your gas tank's done,

1713
01:37:54.290 --> 01:37:56.340
when you thought you were going to kill the guy and the guy's still in front of

1714
01:37:56.341 --> 01:37:59.370
you and you can't move,
you can't move.
Yeah.
But announced,

1715
01:37:59.450 --> 01:38:02.040
start just kept moving forward,
kept moving forward.
You know,

1716
01:38:02.041 --> 01:38:04.860
he didn't want to back up.
He did.
He wanted to keep the pressure on that dude.

1717
01:38:05.310 --> 01:38:08.520
But that front kick to the face,
you gotta,
you gotta give it up to Travis Browne.

1718
01:38:08.521 --> 01:38:09.780
That shit was perfectly placed.

1719
01:38:10.380 --> 01:38:13.960
He tested it a couple times to the body to during the fight.
Yeah.

1720
01:38:14.190 --> 01:38:17.580
Well he's got a long ass reach.
Look at this.
Here's the Combo.
We get this bing,

1721
01:38:17.581 --> 01:38:19.800
bing,
bing,
bing,
bing,
bing,
bing,
bing,
bing,
bing,
bing.

1722
01:38:21.470 --> 01:38:24.950
It's when you get hit.
When you're doing like the speed bag off the,

1723
01:38:24.980 --> 01:38:26.710
off the off the off the fence,
man,

1724
01:38:26.711 --> 01:38:30.000
he might have hit him 10 times in three seconds.
It was incredible.

1725
01:38:30.001 --> 01:38:32.250
How many of those punches was he out?
You know what I mean?

1726
01:38:32.790 --> 01:38:35.400
Most of us had started doing this.

1727
01:38:36.240 --> 01:38:40.160
He was keeping them up with those punches,
with those punches.
The big foot fight.

1728
01:38:40.170 --> 01:38:41.760
Yeah.
Yeah.
Very similar.

1729
01:38:41.790 --> 01:38:45.030
So that kind of knockout I think takes a long time to recover from.

1730
01:38:45.031 --> 01:38:47.430
And obviously I'm not a neurosurgeon,
I'm just talking out of my ass.

1731
01:38:47.640 --> 01:38:51.300
But I would imagine that's an injury that's not,
it's not as simple as,
oh,

1732
01:38:51.301 --> 01:38:54.540
you got knocked out,
you come back,
now you're 100% now you've got an injured.

1733
01:38:54.570 --> 01:38:57.150
Like you,
you know what it's like to injure your back.
You know,

1734
01:38:57.151 --> 01:39:00.750
it's like the injury elbow,
that Shit's got to heal.
It doesn't feel the same.

1735
01:39:00.751 --> 01:39:04.230
And just because you don't feel your brain just because you don't feel all that

1736
01:39:04.231 --> 01:39:04.920
up there.

1737
01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:08.070
Like I would imagine your neural system has to fucking take a little bit of a

1738
01:39:08.071 --> 01:39:10.380
break and it's got to heal up from something like that.

1739
01:39:10.470 --> 01:39:14.040
So they give you like 90 days like before you're allowed to like when you get

1740
01:39:14.041 --> 01:39:16.110
Kayo they'll,
they'll have like a certain amount of days,

1741
01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:21.420
but how they can predict how one person's 90 days is same as that 90 days or

1742
01:39:21.421 --> 01:39:24.150
like you know,
oh Edson Barboza Terry,
Adam,

1743
01:39:24.151 --> 01:39:27.810
90 days when he wheel kicked homeboy and just watched them,

1744
01:39:28.110 --> 01:39:29.950
like you got nailed by a sniper shot.

1745
01:39:31.350 --> 01:39:34.530
That's a different kind of Keio then a,
a quick stoppage.

1746
01:39:34.740 --> 01:39:37.510
But they're both 90 days,
you know,
I think that's,

1747
01:39:37.560 --> 01:39:39.780
there's some significant injuries that happen.

1748
01:39:39.900 --> 01:39:41.850
So that could be a part of what happened to him too.
He's,

1749
01:39:41.860 --> 01:39:44.560
you're dealing with a dude has been knocked out at least eight times.

1750
01:39:44.561 --> 01:39:47.690
And what about confidence too,
right?
Like after,
I mean like you get high,

1751
01:39:47.691 --> 01:39:51.270
he's still super fucking confident,
man.
He's still attack Travis Brown.

1752
01:39:51.510 --> 01:39:54.690
He just ran out of gas.
And then there's also the issue of steroids.

1753
01:39:54.900 --> 01:39:58.320
There's an issue of hormones,
you know,
and he says that he,
he took,

1754
01:39:58.410 --> 01:40:02.550
he got popped and then they kept him off for a year and he said that the reason

1755
01:40:02.551 --> 01:40:05.210
why I did it was because he had a shoulder injury and a doctor prescribed it to

1756
01:40:05.211 --> 01:40:08.010
me.
He didn't know there's testosterone in it,
which is possible.

1757
01:40:08.310 --> 01:40:10.260
But then when he got off of it,

1758
01:40:10.380 --> 01:40:14.610
it showed that his testosterone was like super low.
Like when he lost a big foot,

1759
01:40:14.611 --> 01:40:17.070
they did a test on him and they found his testosterone was very low,

1760
01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:19.650
like in 190 range,
I think they said it was,

1761
01:40:19.651 --> 01:40:22.380
which is very low and it actually kind of dangerous.

1762
01:40:22.381 --> 01:40:24.950
Like you're not supposed to be a professional athlete where you're fucking level

1763
01:40:24.951 --> 01:40:28.650
so low.
And so what's your take on all the dudes doing the TRT?

1764
01:40:29.880 --> 01:40:34.500
Well,
here's the issue.
One trauma stops your body's production of testosterone.

1765
01:40:34.530 --> 01:40:38.130
It's been proven.
The pituitary gland apparently is very sensitive.

1766
01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:42.330
There's a guy named Dr. Mark Gordon who was a specialist in that.

1767
01:40:42.331 --> 01:40:43.051
He worked with James.

1768
01:40:43.051 --> 01:40:46.470
Tony's worked with a bunch of football players and a bunch of people coming back

1769
01:40:46.471 --> 01:40:48.540
from the war traumatic brain injury.

1770
01:40:48.541 --> 01:40:51.090
One of the things that happens is your body loses its ability to produce

1771
01:40:51.091 --> 01:40:55.330
hormones and so a lot of guys who've taken head trauma there,
their test levels,

1772
01:40:55.331 --> 01:40:58.150
la drop.
So then it becomes a question of,
okay,

1773
01:40:58.480 --> 01:41:02.230
if you need to take testosterone because your test levels are dropping because

1774
01:41:02.231 --> 01:41:03.490
you've taken a lot of head trauma,

1775
01:41:03.700 --> 01:41:06.700
at what point in time are we going to keep you away from head trauma?

1776
01:41:07.420 --> 01:41:09.790
Is there ever do we just allow it?

1777
01:41:09.820 --> 01:41:11.710
As long as you can keep supplementing with hormones,

1778
01:41:11.711 --> 01:41:13.990
we allow you to keep getting in there.
Even though your body is like,
look,

1779
01:41:13.991 --> 01:41:16.480
you've rattled our cage.
We're not producing testosterone anymore.

1780
01:41:16.630 --> 01:41:20.020
Well that's okay.
We're just going to get it from a needle and we're fine.

1781
01:41:20.021 --> 01:41:21.910
We're just gonna get right back in there.
You know?

1782
01:41:21.940 --> 01:41:24.880
I think as a a person who values personal freedom,

1783
01:41:24.881 --> 01:41:28.060
I certainly think they should be able to do that.
The question becomes though,

1784
01:41:28.240 --> 01:41:33.220
when they do it,
how much should they really be able to get?
I mean how much,

1785
01:41:33.400 --> 01:41:34.390
how,
I mean,
how do you,

1786
01:41:34.391 --> 01:41:38.620
how do we like really closely regulated because it looks like some people get

1787
01:41:38.621 --> 01:41:39.460
more than others.

1788
01:41:39.700 --> 01:41:43.360
Some people like their bodies are radically change and all of a sudden they look

1789
01:41:43.361 --> 01:41:45.340
like super athletes when they were kind of Doughy,

1790
01:41:45.341 --> 01:41:46.660
just a couple of fights before.

1791
01:41:46.900 --> 01:41:51.280
That's obviously something a little bit bigger than just,
you know,

1792
01:41:51.310 --> 01:41:54.760
bringing your,
your,
your levels up to a normal range.

1793
01:41:54.761 --> 01:41:57.940
It seems like they're hyper levels.
Yeah.
I don't know if it's the case,

1794
01:41:57.941 --> 01:41:59.250
but it looks like that.
I would you,

1795
01:41:59.260 --> 01:42:02.680
you'd obviously have to test them on daily basis to really get an accurate read

1796
01:42:02.681 --> 01:42:05.740
of what their levels are,
but the thing is,

1797
01:42:06.370 --> 01:42:09.640
unless you are randomly testing them on a regular basis,

1798
01:42:09.641 --> 01:42:12.790
people can cheat and there's ways that people could cheat anyway.

1799
01:42:13.030 --> 01:42:15.610
There's ways people,
people use fake dicks.
You know,

1800
01:42:15.611 --> 01:42:18.430
the people who have been like Tom Sizemore apparently tried to use a fake dick

1801
01:42:18.431 --> 01:42:22.530
when he was at a rehab place and ready to go to a halfway house.
God bless them,

1802
01:42:22.531 --> 01:42:26.030
they said that pulls out a fake hog.
He's trying to visit in a competent,

1803
01:42:26.050 --> 01:42:29.260
like what do you doing?
Good.
That's a fake Dick.
You crazy.

1804
01:42:29.290 --> 01:42:32.470
They sell them and we'd magazines.
Well,
there's a lot of people,
man,

1805
01:42:32.471 --> 01:42:35.890
that's the reality of their job.
You know?
And you have to,
you have to be clean.

1806
01:42:36.340 --> 01:42:40.350
But I think TRT is a tricky situation because it's hard know I think,
hey,

1807
01:42:40.351 --> 01:42:44.200
like freedom of being a human and if you need it in your life.
Yeah,
yeah.

1808
01:42:44.230 --> 01:42:47.860
But if I'm,
you know,
if I was a fighter,

1809
01:42:47.890 --> 01:42:51.130
what about matchmaking fan of the fight game?
It's tricky.

1810
01:42:51.300 --> 01:42:54.520
And to me it's almost as controversial or I say almost,

1811
01:42:54.640 --> 01:42:57.790
but it's almost as controversial as men,
transsexuals,

1812
01:42:57.791 --> 01:43:00.790
that men that become women and they want to compete as women because there's

1813
01:43:00.791 --> 01:43:03.670
already been one of those and there's one in basketball as well.

1814
01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:07.210
I think that's just as controversial as adding testosterone and being able to

1815
01:43:07.211 --> 01:43:11.700
find not,
I shouldn't say that.
It's not just as controversial,
but it's,
it's a,

1816
01:43:11.710 --> 01:43:15.100
you know,
it's close.
[inaudible] being the testosterone is weird.

1817
01:43:15.400 --> 01:43:18.580
The idea that you can just put it in your body and then go out there and fight

1818
01:43:18.581 --> 01:43:21.850
as if like you're so good,
like your body is producing that much testosterone,

1819
01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.190
you're that aggressive.
No.
Like as you get older,

1820
01:43:24.280 --> 01:43:26.830
your body starts slowing down like naturally.

1821
01:43:27.190 --> 01:43:31.000
So if you want to still compete and you want to still compete like,

1822
01:43:31.001 --> 01:43:33.010
like a young man,
that is the way to do it.

1823
01:43:33.011 --> 01:43:36.820
The question is how old should you be when you're allowed to do that?

1824
01:43:36.850 --> 01:43:39.460
Like if it's a 46 year old Randy couture,
you go,
okay,
I get it.

1825
01:43:40.390 --> 01:43:42.940
But he wasn't even doing it.
Right.
So,
but if it's,

1826
01:43:42.970 --> 01:43:46.900
if it's a a 27 year old guy,
which there have been,

1827
01:43:47.080 --> 01:43:51.860
there's been guys as young as 25 how old Vitola he's in his thirties like 34 or

1828
01:43:51.861 --> 01:43:52.250
something.

1829
01:43:52.250 --> 01:43:56.750
<v 5>Right?
Let's find out.
That's not very old.
No it's not because I'm 31 yeah,</v>

1830
01:43:56.751 --> 01:43:59.370
I know a couple of guys do it.
I know.

1831
01:43:59.510 --> 01:44:04.270
And the thing,
I mean it was like,
you know,
they,
they,

1832
01:44:04.271 --> 01:44:06.860
they love it.
They said it may feel great and all this,

1833
01:44:06.861 --> 01:44:09.890
and then they have to do with a needle every day and everything once a week.

1834
01:44:09.891 --> 01:44:12.210
You do it once a week or you put on cream every day.

1835
01:44:12.280 --> 01:44:15.260
They're doing a needle every day.
They're crazy.
Maybe I'm mistaken,

1836
01:44:15.261 --> 01:44:18.950
but still it's like,
you know,
um,
and I was like,
all right,
won't for how long?

1837
01:44:18.951 --> 01:44:22.700
It was that forever.
Forever.
Yeah.

1838
01:44:22.740 --> 01:44:25.460
It's like crabbers not real.
That's part of the problem.

1839
01:44:25.580 --> 01:44:29.330
But if you want your body to work really good right now,
that's the solution.

1840
01:44:29.600 --> 01:44:33.980
The question to me is not testosterone replacement as like a,
a practice.

1841
01:44:34.220 --> 01:44:36.740
Because I feel like I would take anything that makes my body work better.

1842
01:44:36.830 --> 01:44:39.860
I'll take,
vitamins,
will take whatever it makes it work better.
Like they say,

1843
01:44:39.861 --> 01:44:42.120
got to do it forever.
I'm gonna brush my teeth forever too.

1844
01:44:42.270 --> 01:44:44.600
So a lot of Shit I'm gonna do forever then I'm not scared of.
Right.
You know,

1845
01:44:44.810 --> 01:44:47.210
your teeth will be gone someday.
I'll get some new ones.
Man.

1846
01:44:47.270 --> 01:44:50.720
I've seen Mike Goldberg got some new front teeth.
They're beautiful,
amazing,

1847
01:44:50.750 --> 01:44:55.010
lost and playing hockey.
They just bitches in place.
They put two right.

1848
01:44:55.040 --> 01:44:57.510
You got like a post in your mouth and they,
yeah,

1849
01:44:57.530 --> 01:44:59.630
I have a fake tooth up and then I got to get on it.

1850
01:44:59.631 --> 01:45:02.780
I'm actually due for one right now.
That's how crazy little operation there,
man.

1851
01:45:02.900 --> 01:45:04.700
Wait,
when you get the front teeth fake,

1852
01:45:04.820 --> 01:45:07.990
do you still have to do the rods like what I do or like the titanium rod.

1853
01:45:07.991 --> 01:45:10.130
He screwed it right into his head.
Yeah.

1854
01:45:10.131 --> 01:45:13.400
I think that's how they make sure that the teeth stay and when when they do that

1855
01:45:13.401 --> 01:45:16.220
they're apparently like super strong.
Like it's just like a regular tooth.

1856
01:45:16.610 --> 01:45:19.040
Like they have these incredible composite teeth now.

1857
01:45:19.100 --> 01:45:21.920
They're like really tough and well made.
They look exactly like your teeth.

1858
01:45:22.130 --> 01:45:23.960
I mean his shit looks perfect to wood.

1859
01:45:24.020 --> 01:45:27.470
It's amazing what some people have fucking gotten their teeth hack downs but

1860
01:45:27.471 --> 01:45:29.930
caps on to make it more pretty.
A lot of people that did that.

1861
01:45:29.960 --> 01:45:33.500
That's pretty crazy,
man.
That's pretty crazy.
Just for cosmetics,

1862
01:45:33.710 --> 01:45:36.950
like you're going to go with a full mouth of fake teeth.
Hi.
You look up,

1863
01:45:38.450 --> 01:45:41.870
you know you've got to pay for a mouth,
Teddy Roosevelt style.

1864
01:45:42.680 --> 01:45:46.340
You see so much in this town though.
I know so many people that got that done.

1865
01:45:46.341 --> 01:45:50.780
Yes.
I A friend of mine did it.
Yeah,
and the most.
That's creepy.
Yeah.
It's weird.

1866
01:45:51.290 --> 01:45:55.760
It's weird.
Yeah.
I don't,
yeah.
I don't know,
man.
I guess bleach your teeth.

1867
01:45:55.761 --> 01:45:59.390
Have you smoked cigarettes?
I need to do it,
but that testosterone thing,

1868
01:45:59.391 --> 01:46:01.610
I think it's,
it's a beginning brow and this is the real problem.

1869
01:46:01.611 --> 01:46:05.210
It's not testosterone and human growth hormone.
It's the inevitability,

1870
01:46:05.570 --> 01:46:09.380
the inevitability of biological engineering,
the inevitability that science,

1871
01:46:09.381 --> 01:46:10.370
technology all.

1872
01:46:10.371 --> 01:46:13.670
Then we'll combine because there's a massive market for figuring out how to make

1873
01:46:13.671 --> 01:46:14.720
the human body work better.

1874
01:46:15.050 --> 01:46:18.680
Kurzweil told me when I interviewed him that we're are a decade away from

1875
01:46:18.681 --> 01:46:21.890
inventing red blood cells that are artificial that will allow you to hold your

1876
01:46:21.891 --> 01:46:23.210
breath for four hours.

1877
01:46:23.870 --> 01:46:26.360
He said you'll be able to sit at the bottom of the pool for four hours.

1878
01:46:26.370 --> 01:46:28.700
A regular person.
You don't have to be a super athlete.

1879
01:46:28.701 --> 01:46:29.690
You don't have to be a monk.

1880
01:46:29.691 --> 01:46:32.300
You don't have to be some fucking dude lives in the mountains.

1881
01:46:32.301 --> 01:46:36.920
Just eating raw salmon for a year.
Practice and Catia.
No,
just one dude.

1882
01:46:37.500 --> 01:46:40.220
Some artificial blood cells injected into system.

1883
01:46:42.020 --> 01:46:44.480
Take a deep breath and you have plenty of oxygen for four hours.

1884
01:46:44.510 --> 01:46:48.290
It's fucking crazy.
And he said it's,
it's inevitable.
It's coming.

1885
01:46:48.350 --> 01:46:50.040
They're already working on it and it's

1886
01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:52.090
<v 3>going to be awesome,
dude.
It's going to be incredible.</v>

1887
01:46:52.190 --> 01:46:54.870
This is going to be no sense in working out,
go spear fishing.

1888
01:46:55.110 --> 01:46:57.510
But then when there's no sense in working out,
it's almost like,

1889
01:46:57.511 --> 01:46:58.770
are we going to be spoiled?

1890
01:46:58.800 --> 01:47:02.460
Is it going to be like the same thing that has fucked a lot of people when they

1891
01:47:02.461 --> 01:47:04.200
have so much access to entertain?
Man,

1892
01:47:04.201 --> 01:47:07.920
it's made kids lazy because they sit in front of the TV and vegetate the not as

1893
01:47:07.921 --> 01:47:10.230
creative or active as younger kids.
I mean that's the argument,

1894
01:47:10.530 --> 01:47:13.070
but what is it going to be like when you can just be a superhero?
Yeah,

1895
01:47:13.470 --> 01:47:16.320
boats are going to go out of business.
You can fly.

1896
01:47:16.380 --> 01:47:20.070
Let's just go to Catalina island.
There's a difference.
Could walk.
Yeah,

1897
01:47:20.071 --> 01:47:22.590
you're gonna be able to fucking hold your breath under water and walk across to

1898
01:47:22.591 --> 01:47:25.620
Catalina.
And when you,
when you,
all you have to do is get to the surface,

1899
01:47:25.621 --> 01:47:28.050
take a deep breath and go right the fuck back under and you're good for another

1900
01:47:28.051 --> 01:47:31.800
four hours.
Jesus Christ,
a little baby oxygen tank.

1901
01:47:31.801 --> 01:47:34.380
You could just walk on the ground in the hallway,
no problem.

1902
01:47:34.780 --> 01:47:39.030
But it will be a people of no fortitude.
Well,
they're also working on skin,

1903
01:47:39.360 --> 01:47:41.730
artificial skin.
That is the,

1904
01:47:41.740 --> 01:47:45.210
that they merge human DNA with spider silk.

1905
01:47:45.810 --> 01:47:48.690
It sounds like a God damn comic book.
It sounds like Spiderman,

1906
01:47:48.900 --> 01:47:51.660
but they're working on,
they're literally going to have artificial skin.

1907
01:47:51.661 --> 01:47:52.890
That's bullet proof.

1908
01:47:53.490 --> 01:47:57.510
So you're gonna have skin like on your body that's like your skin looks like

1909
01:47:57.511 --> 01:48:01.800
skin,
but it's,
it's a fucking bulletproof.
Like literally nothing can hurt it.

1910
01:48:02.610 --> 01:48:06.330
That's possible.
I mean,
it's not something I'm inventing with my imagination.

1911
01:48:06.450 --> 01:48:07.880
This is like something that they've,
they've,

1912
01:48:07.920 --> 01:48:11.670
it's a proof of concept idea that they're taking from like the laboratory and

1913
01:48:11.671 --> 01:48:13.640
they're starting to try to see if they could actually develop it.

1914
01:48:17.100 --> 01:48:21.630
If it's pliable,
you can still get choked out.
It's so true.

1915
01:48:21.660 --> 01:48:22.770
You just jump on their back.

1916
01:48:22.860 --> 01:48:26.190
Maybe that would be at the end all when people become impossible to knock out,

1917
01:48:26.250 --> 01:48:27.290
it'll all be about you.
Just,

1918
01:48:27.291 --> 01:48:32.291
you just got to get to that neck a let him and make bulletproof.

1919
01:48:32.520 --> 01:48:33.950
You're not choke proved dog.
Yeah.

1920
01:48:34.430 --> 01:48:37.770
Well there's a dude named Rafael dos Anjos and uh,

1921
01:48:37.800 --> 01:48:42.600
he got his jaw broke and a fight and now he said his jaw is a weapon because

1922
01:48:42.601 --> 01:48:43.950
he's had so many titanium.

1923
01:48:43.951 --> 01:48:48.480
He's got titanium plates and eight screws in his jaw and two dudes in a row have

1924
01:48:48.481 --> 01:48:52.590
broken their hand on his jaw.
Wow.
Cause he's like my job a weapon now.

1925
01:48:52.860 --> 01:48:55.470
Like it doesn't knock me apparently when you get your job fix too,

1926
01:48:55.650 --> 01:48:59.190
like that issue of like you're jogging and tink,
sometimes that goes away.

1927
01:48:59.310 --> 01:49:00.300
Not for every dude's,

1928
01:49:00.360 --> 01:49:03.270
but some time for some dudes you can't knock them out as easy.

1929
01:49:03.540 --> 01:49:06.030
Like once your jaw gets fixed,
apparently it's,

1930
01:49:06.040 --> 01:49:10.570
it's like stiffer or stays in place better yet it doesn't break as easy because

1931
01:49:10.571 --> 01:49:14.280
they've got screws and plates in it and wires and shit in it and it's harder to

1932
01:49:14.281 --> 01:49:17.100
get knocked out.
So this dude is like,
I mean,

1933
01:49:17.160 --> 01:49:21.300
what happens if someone like they just start making fake bones like wolverine

1934
01:49:21.301 --> 01:49:21.840
style.

1935
01:49:21.840 --> 01:49:25.260
Everybody has a scar from the top of their head all the way down to their ass

1936
01:49:25.261 --> 01:49:28.260
crack because they just fucking pulled you out of that bitch and put some

1937
01:49:28.261 --> 01:49:31.500
fucking good fake bones on you and now you never get hurt.

1938
01:49:32.250 --> 01:49:37.250
He just run around with fucking carbon fiber bones running through walls and

1939
01:49:37.291 --> 01:49:39.510
shit.
Kicking people with like an aluminum bat.

1940
01:49:42.390 --> 01:49:46.320
That'll be me.
Fight to the death care.
Well,
there'll be no competition anymore.

1941
01:49:46.321 --> 01:49:47.160
That's the real issue.

1942
01:49:47.170 --> 01:49:51.550
The real issue is like competition and sports is a big part of what like sedates

1943
01:49:51.551 --> 01:49:56.030
the masses.
It keeps people like tuned in to that as like a method of conquest.

1944
01:49:56.031 --> 01:49:59.300
So yeah,
we're going to fuck you kicked the Lakers ass tonight.
Ooh.

1945
01:49:59.410 --> 01:50:01.150
When meanwhile they're completely sedentary.

1946
01:50:01.330 --> 01:50:05.020
They're existing in this fucking maze is fake world and they're getting their

1947
01:50:05.021 --> 01:50:07.660
gladiator instincts out through that.
Well,
if that all goes away,

1948
01:50:07.870 --> 01:50:11.830
they're going to have to seek some sort of other release for this and that's

1949
01:50:11.850 --> 01:50:12.370
that.
That's,

1950
01:50:12.370 --> 01:50:16.690
that's an issue that people face and when you give people some sort of

1951
01:50:16.840 --> 01:50:19.930
distraction,
that's 46% are going to go right for it.

1952
01:50:23.160 --> 01:50:23.993
<v 6>Okay?</v>

1953
01:50:24.640 --> 01:50:27.610
<v 3>That's what we got fix.
It couldn't fix that.
You just cut out,</v>

1954
01:50:27.611 --> 01:50:31.840
cut out the number of dummies,
cull the herd.
How are you going to do it though?

1955
01:50:31.990 --> 01:50:33.340
You say that?
Okay.
Let me ask you this.

1956
01:50:33.341 --> 01:50:36.670
If ever Everlast if you were an alien from another planet,
Super Smart,

1957
01:50:36.850 --> 01:50:40.310
had your shit together.
Totally.
And he came to earth and you know you are.
Yes,

1958
01:50:40.510 --> 01:50:42.130
you can do whatever the fuck you want.
You're an alien.

1959
01:50:42.131 --> 01:50:44.230
You're from a thousand million years in the future.
You guys.

1960
01:50:44.231 --> 01:50:47.190
So I have no conscience or or your conscience.
But

1961
01:50:49.060 --> 01:50:51.400
if like if you came upon,
let me ask you this.

1962
01:50:51.401 --> 01:50:55.390
If you came upon a village and the village was run by a bunch of rabid monkeys,

1963
01:50:55.540 --> 01:50:58.000
there was millions of them.
They were fucking up everything,

1964
01:50:58.001 --> 01:51:01.810
throwing shit at people stealing candy,
Mcginn babies.

1965
01:51:02.140 --> 01:51:04.750
You would want to start killing monkeys,
right?
Okay,
well,

1966
01:51:04.751 --> 01:51:06.280
Mike is your intelligent little animals.

1967
01:51:06.850 --> 01:51:10.870
If something is so far advanced from us that it can get here from Alpha Centauri

1968
01:51:10.871 --> 01:51:14.710
and a metal ship,
who knows how what they're going to think about us.

1969
01:51:14.860 --> 01:51:16.270
They might look at us as like,
Oh,

1970
01:51:16.271 --> 01:51:21.250
this is this dangerous stage that a being gets when it's starting to transcend

1971
01:51:21.251 --> 01:51:26.080
from its animal instincts into this,
this new emergent consciousness,

1972
01:51:26.081 --> 01:51:28.750
this group consciousness that's inevitable for this species,

1973
01:51:28.810 --> 01:51:30.100
but right now it's crazy.

1974
01:51:30.430 --> 01:51:34.200
Right now it's running around fucking shooting guns at each other and smash into

1975
01:51:34.201 --> 01:51:36.100
each other on the highway and polluting things,

1976
01:51:36.310 --> 01:51:39.440
dumping shit in the ocean and pulling out all the fish and whew.

1977
01:51:39.570 --> 01:51:41.830
Leaving a giant garbage patch in the middle of the ocean,

1978
01:51:41.831 --> 01:51:46.260
going to punk rock shows.
Fuck rage against the machine.
Maybe they're like,
oh,

1979
01:51:46.270 --> 01:51:50.380
he's pitches aren't ready.
They're not ready.
They're not ready.

1980
01:51:50.381 --> 01:51:52.360
We got to kill some of them.
How do we get to kill some of them?

1981
01:51:52.390 --> 01:51:55.990
Who Do you want to kill you?
All the stupid ones,
but we need them to work.

1982
01:51:56.020 --> 01:51:58.870
We need the robot.
Technology is not ready for Mcdonald's yet.

1983
01:51:58.930 --> 01:52:02.680
You know you can't have robot workers make any cheeseburgers.
So until that time,

1984
01:52:03.070 --> 01:52:06.670
what the fuck do you do?
If you were an alien and you had the,
you had to say,

1985
01:52:08.960 --> 01:52:11.360
<v 6>well,
you know you're,
you're,
you're,</v>

1986
01:52:11.361 --> 01:52:15.140
you're giving me like a kind hearted alien scenario.

1987
01:52:15.141 --> 01:52:17.540
Like I'm an alien with a conscience.

1988
01:52:17.960 --> 01:52:20.870
I could also be the alien that comes and looks at it like,

1989
01:52:20.871 --> 01:52:25.871
well there's this ant hill and it's in my garden and it's kind of serving a

1990
01:52:26.691 --> 01:52:29.060
purpose,
but it's getting too big.

1991
01:52:30.230 --> 01:52:34.820
So I just got to stomp out half.
She's fucking
made me.

1992
01:52:34.821 --> 01:52:38.960
They just throw an asteroid our way.
Maybe that's what fucked up the dinosaurs.

1993
01:52:39.040 --> 01:52:42.680
How's you going to do is change the degrees of the planet like by three and

1994
01:52:42.740 --> 01:52:45.920
either direction and the whole world's fucked.
Well,
all they have to do,

1995
01:52:45.950 --> 01:52:48.710
here's what pulls the plug,
don't it?
Just put it,
what are they,

1996
01:52:48.711 --> 01:52:53.510
what do they call that one or not?
Some electromagnetic pulse and it's easy.

1997
01:52:53.670 --> 01:52:58.070
Put the lights out.
Survival of the fittest.
Well one solar flare would do that,

1998
01:52:58.071 --> 01:52:58.310
right?

1999
01:52:58.310 --> 01:53:01.640
One gigantic solar flare would elite shut us down till we figured out how to

2000
01:53:01.641 --> 01:53:04.950
reboot things.
Clear hardrock and last and last and last.
Yeah,

2001
01:53:05.120 --> 01:53:09.770
you have some electronics already put into a container in the round.

2002
01:53:09.771 --> 01:53:11.720
Deep in the ground.
They don't have to be deep in the ground.

2003
01:53:11.721 --> 01:53:14.380
They just have to be well sealed within a metal container.
You like,

2004
01:53:14.381 --> 01:53:18.770
you can get an old style metal garbage can really take a fucking plastic bag.

2005
01:53:19.040 --> 01:53:21.200
Like put a plastic bag in it.
Like you're going to use real trash.

2006
01:53:21.201 --> 01:53:23.480
Put a bunch of walkie talkies and stuff with the like in there,

2007
01:53:23.690 --> 01:53:25.460
close the plastic bag tied up,
Bang,

2008
01:53:25.610 --> 01:53:29.420
put the lid back on it and take that motherfucker seal it shut somehow.

2009
01:53:29.421 --> 01:53:32.090
And like if you ever did have that electric,
magnetic pulse,

2010
01:53:32.990 --> 01:53:37.620
those things would still be good afterwards.
Bro,
are you a prepper?
No,
but I,

2011
01:53:38.020 --> 01:53:41.030
I'm,
I'm prepared though.
You Doomsday prepping.

2012
01:53:41.210 --> 01:53:45.070
You got electronics in a garbage bag anywhere.
Really?
Yeah.

2013
01:53:45.200 --> 01:53:48.410
So I got to have a glass house of the shit hits the fan and I got,

2014
01:53:48.411 --> 01:53:53.170
I got storage units full of water dog.
Do you really know?
Oh Damn Dude.
Yeah,

2015
01:53:53.550 --> 01:53:56.270
that's smart and practical.
You know what's freaking me out lately?

2016
01:53:56.810 --> 01:54:00.140
Not to freak people out.
Some crazy shit.
Look like Hurricane Sandy.

2017
01:54:00.410 --> 01:54:00.891
You know what I mean?

2018
01:54:00.891 --> 01:54:03.470
Look at anything like that and wouldn't yo when your whole block doesn't have

2019
01:54:03.471 --> 01:54:07.370
anything and nobody shows up for a week.
Listen,
my good friend lived for that.

2020
01:54:07.670 --> 01:54:09.830
My good friend Tommy Jr,
he told me that they used,

2021
01:54:10.040 --> 01:54:12.080
they had to drive four hours to use their cell phones.

2022
01:54:12.470 --> 01:54:15.680
Like your phone wouldn't work anywhere.
You had to drive like way the fuck out.

2023
01:54:15.681 --> 01:54:18.920
He lives in um,
in,
in Connecticut,
like right near the New York border.

2024
01:54:19.190 --> 01:54:22.850
And he had a drive,
you know,
fucking hours.
They said that food was nowhere.

2025
01:54:22.910 --> 01:54:25.040
Like within a day food was gone everywhere.

2026
01:54:25.160 --> 01:54:29.360
People were like going to Dunkin donuts and wait in line at Dunkin donuts just

2027
01:54:29.361 --> 01:54:32.120
to get something to fill your belly.
And then they're running out of food.

2028
01:54:32.300 --> 01:54:33.710
I mean there's like almost nothing left.

2029
01:54:34.190 --> 01:54:37.850
He said it was crazy and he said it happened so fast.
He was like,
he goes,

2030
01:54:37.851 --> 01:54:40.820
you would think this has helped Tommy junior talks.
She goes,

2031
01:54:41.060 --> 01:54:44.540
you would think they were prepared,
right?
You would think,

2032
01:54:44.630 --> 01:54:48.260
well let's see if the power goes out for a week.

2033
01:54:48.320 --> 01:54:51.780
We're going to need this amount of emergency foods so let's have it nearby goes,

2034
01:54:51.800 --> 01:54:54.110
fuck that dude.
He goes,
they weren't prepared at all.

2035
01:54:54.111 --> 01:54:58.190
It was every man for themselves and he goes in a really made you realize how

2036
01:54:58.191 --> 01:55:02.510
fucking scary things could get in like that.
He goes,
cause this wasn't shit.

2037
01:55:02.720 --> 01:55:04.010
He goes,
it was a big storm,

2038
01:55:04.340 --> 01:55:06.140
but he was like talking about like thinking about all the things that have

2039
01:55:06.141 --> 01:55:07.250
happened throughout history,

2040
01:55:07.480 --> 01:55:11.060
human history that we know of that was way bigger than that and think about all

2041
01:55:11.061 --> 01:55:12.410
the shit that happened in the dark,

2042
01:55:12.411 --> 01:55:17.160
dark past of the fucking earth when we know let's put a carved and just a couple

2043
01:55:17.161 --> 01:55:20.750
of major events and now just just string a couple of those major events
together.

2044
01:55:20.751 --> 01:55:24.620
Like,
say
something even larger than Sandy.

2045
01:55:25.070 --> 01:55:29.870
Katrina is,
let's just say at the same time,
it's not,
it's far fetched,

2046
01:55:29.871 --> 01:55:30.704
but at any possible,

2047
01:55:30.800 --> 01:55:34.130
remember when that volcano went off and like nobody could fly for fucking,

2048
01:55:34.131 --> 01:55:35.950
I was stuck in Europe.
Dog Let go.

2049
01:55:35.951 --> 01:55:40.040
So let's say combine it with some super volcano eruption.
It's not that hard.

2050
01:55:40.090 --> 01:55:42.860
I'm not even talking about schemes are disasters of the end of the world.

2051
01:55:42.860 --> 01:55:46.110
I'm talking about motherfuckers get hungry,
they get vicious man,

2052
01:55:46.111 --> 01:55:49.610
and I'm gonna keep mines.
Yeah,
and we don't have our,
our,

2053
01:55:49.620 --> 01:55:51.990
our life is not set up organically right now.

2054
01:55:52.230 --> 01:55:54.480
Our life is set up to revolve around the,

2055
01:55:54.481 --> 01:55:58.350
the grid and until people develop as much food,

2056
01:55:58.351 --> 01:56:02.970
as much access to food organically as I do by getting things shipped and

2057
01:56:02.971 --> 01:56:04.140
carrying them from here and there.

2058
01:56:04.290 --> 01:56:07.650
If you are not responsible for the production and cultivation of your own food,

2059
01:56:07.651 --> 01:56:10.830
which most people don't have the opportunity to be,
then you're not autonomous.

2060
01:56:10.860 --> 01:56:11.820
And if you're,
if you're not,

2061
01:56:11.821 --> 01:56:15.360
if you can't support yourself and some shit hits the fan,
you got a real problem.

2062
01:56:15.361 --> 01:56:19.080
Because also something that,
God forbid,

2063
01:56:19.530 --> 01:56:22.650
I'm going to put in there where the truck stop coming into the supermarkets.

2064
01:56:22.950 --> 01:56:25.560
You know,
I got out.
So you asked me if from a prepper,
I guess.
Yeah.
You know,
in,

2065
01:56:25.570 --> 01:56:29.340
in,
in,
uh,
yeah,
I guess I am because I'm fucking ready dog.
Well,
I'm gonna,

2066
01:56:29.370 --> 01:56:31.890
I'm gonna get you with Steve Rinella,
man.
I'm ready for like that.

2067
01:56:32.010 --> 01:56:35.370
I have a number,
I'll get to wherever,
you know,
I gotta get like through,

2068
01:56:35.520 --> 01:56:39.480
if there's a certain amount of time there's going to go.
They also,
I believe,

2069
01:56:39.481 --> 01:56:42.150
you know,
living in our society,
it's like,
even if something bad did happen,

2070
01:56:42.151 --> 01:56:43.770
you're only talking about at the worst.

2071
01:56:43.771 --> 01:56:47.460
You need to be able to hold yourself accountable for yourself for about three

2072
01:56:47.461 --> 01:56:50.250
months at its worst.
That's what I figured.
You know what I mean?

2073
01:56:50.430 --> 01:56:52.500
Unless we're talking about some nuclear disaster and then it's like,

2074
01:56:52.501 --> 01:56:53.820
who the fuck wants to be here anyways?

2075
01:56:53.821 --> 01:56:57.150
Take me out when that motherfucker happens.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

2076
01:56:57.151 --> 01:56:58.260
That's the thing,
right?
It's like,

2077
01:56:58.261 --> 01:57:01.710
how much damage do you want done to the earth before you like to this?

2078
01:57:01.710 --> 01:57:04.680
I don't want to be here and I don't want to be here for Cannibal days,
right?

2079
01:57:04.710 --> 01:57:07.550
When you'd rather be dead than CB bull cannibalizing.

2080
01:57:07.551 --> 01:57:10.470
People pull up on a ranch like,
Hey,
do you guys get any food?

2081
01:57:10.471 --> 01:57:13.260
And you'd see them fucking saw and a leg in the backyard and you're like,
oh,

2082
01:57:13.261 --> 01:57:17.340
Jesus.
They're eating people,
right?
That's going to happen.
I mean,

2083
01:57:17.341 --> 01:57:21.180
it would fucking happen without a doubt.
It would happen.
It's possible.

2084
01:57:21.210 --> 01:57:22.140
It's happened in the past.

2085
01:57:22.180 --> 01:57:25.110
The nez Perce Indians apparently were like big on cannibalism.

2086
01:57:25.500 --> 01:57:28.470
They were cannibalizing the fuck out of people because they lived in Montana and

2087
01:57:28.471 --> 01:57:32.850
shit got real cold in the winter and it's hard to find deer and it's even harder

2088
01:57:32.851 --> 01:57:34.500
to shoot him with a fucking bow and arrow.

2089
01:57:34.860 --> 01:57:37.830
So when you stumble upon some people that is living in some wooden house,

2090
01:57:37.831 --> 01:57:41.700
you're like,
oh yeah,
we got some food here.
It's ethos fucking people.

2091
01:57:42.660 --> 01:57:45.780
That was on a couple of hundred years and there's all kinds of which crafty

2092
01:57:45.781 --> 01:57:49.230
things that go with that to witchcraft team.
Yeah.

2093
01:57:50.070 --> 01:57:51.270
That's something I want to investigate.

2094
01:57:52.110 --> 01:57:57.110
Spiritual beliefs about eating humans and how power is it bestows upon the,

2095
01:57:57.600 --> 01:58:01.310
yeah,
the eaters and General Butt Naked Times.

2096
01:58:01.310 --> 01:58:03.300
<v 8>It's not a power thing.
Sometimes it's like a,</v>

2097
01:58:03.320 --> 01:58:07.310
there's a Nicholas Neba and he wrote a book called Keep Your River on your left

2098
01:58:07.311 --> 01:58:10.810
or on the right or whatever,
and he ate people.
He,

2099
01:58:10.960 --> 01:58:15.560
he practiced cannibalism with a specific culture and they did it when a relative

2100
01:58:15.561 --> 01:58:17.450
died and when the relative died,

2101
01:58:17.660 --> 01:58:21.790
there'd be this ceremony where they would all get together and pray and sing or

2102
01:58:21.791 --> 01:58:24.440
what,
or it was just like just morning,
some sort of morning.

2103
01:58:24.441 --> 01:58:25.700
I don't even know if they did anything,

2104
01:58:25.910 --> 01:58:30.350
but then they would consume ritually like certain parts of the family member

2105
01:58:30.380 --> 01:58:33.620
altogether.
Ooh,
that's dark.

2106
01:58:34.380 --> 01:58:36.510
<v 6>I don't want to eat people and I definitely don't want to eat my grandma.</v>

2107
01:58:37.060 --> 01:58:38.610
I definitely want it to be a stranger.

2108
01:58:38.740 --> 01:58:42.040
<v 8>Well,
sometimes it's not a survival thing.
Sometimes it's not award thing.</v>

2109
01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:44.650
<v 6>Sometimes it's just like,
it's one of my jokes though.</v>

2110
01:58:44.651 --> 01:58:47.620
Like whenever we're on planes or something and if we go down y'all,
y'all could,

2111
01:58:47.680 --> 01:58:50.390
y'all could eat me,
man.
It's okay.
Yeah.

2112
01:58:50.560 --> 01:58:54.830
I would trade my grandmother for somebody else,
you know,
have my grandmother eat,

2113
01:58:55.330 --> 01:58:59.380
take her daughter.
They're obviously not doing it to enjoy it,
you know?

2114
01:58:59.381 --> 01:59:02.770
Like it's just,
I guess somehow or another,

2115
01:59:02.771 --> 01:59:06.190
I think they're consuming something of the person who brings him closer to that

2116
01:59:06.191 --> 01:59:07.030
person or something.

2117
01:59:07.031 --> 01:59:10.390
Or we're just finalizing the idea in their mind that they're gone.

2118
01:59:10.570 --> 01:59:14.690
Religion something.
Have you ever been to a funeral with an open casket?
Yeah,

2119
01:59:15.760 --> 01:59:20.440
my father's,
my grandfather was telling one of her bender.
It was very strange.

2120
01:59:20.710 --> 01:59:24.700
It was tough.
It didn't,
it didn't seem like him.
No.
You know,

2121
01:59:25.030 --> 01:59:27.910
even though I know it was him,
I was like,
where is he?
He's not there.
No,

2122
01:59:28.030 --> 01:59:31.000
they aren't.
They aren't there.
That's the,
that's the bizarrest part.
It was like,

2123
01:59:31.001 --> 01:59:35.710
you know,
so strange.
It's the argument for that divine spark or that soul,

2124
01:59:35.740 --> 01:59:37.750
you know what I mean?
It's like,
cause there's not,

2125
01:59:37.751 --> 01:59:41.410
they're the same thing that the shells there.
Yeah.
You know what I mean?

2126
01:59:41.920 --> 01:59:44.080
But it doesn't even look real.
It doesn't look like the same.

2127
01:59:44.081 --> 01:59:46.480
And I know he was made up a little bit and all this,

2128
01:59:46.481 --> 01:59:49.540
but I'm saying just there was something,
yeah,

2129
01:59:49.541 --> 01:59:52.810
I don't know what the flat right about it.
I don't know what that transition is,

2130
01:59:52.811 --> 01:59:55.420
but I have a feeling it's just not who we think it is.

2131
01:59:55.720 --> 01:59:57.280
I think the idea of life and death,

2132
01:59:57.281 --> 02:00:02.281
it's just what you're dealing with is one tiny frame in a fractal universe.

2133
02:00:02.401 --> 02:00:06.490
I remember only one thing from the experience.
What do you remember?
Just a voice.

2134
02:00:06.660 --> 02:00:09.110
What'd it say?
Suck it.
You know?

2135
02:00:13.030 --> 02:00:16.210
It was like a voice that was just familiar,
comfortable.

2136
02:00:16.211 --> 02:00:17.620
Kind of like your grandfather's voice.

2137
02:00:17.621 --> 02:00:19.630
But I wouldn't say it was my grandfather's voice.

2138
02:00:19.631 --> 02:00:22.280
But you understand what I'm saying?
Just and it,

2139
02:00:22.530 --> 02:00:26.710
it was just saying like,
I was in the wrong place kind of vibe.

2140
02:00:26.860 --> 02:00:29.680
I don't even know if it was words or just a feeling that was being conveyed to

2141
02:00:29.681 --> 02:00:31.030
me.
Right.
Look you're going to come back,

2142
02:00:31.031 --> 02:00:35.590
but it was definitely the only conscious thing I can remember from the

2143
02:00:35.591 --> 02:00:39.220
whatever's several minutes that I was supposedly dead.
Wow,

2144
02:00:39.850 --> 02:00:41.650
that's trippy dude.
You've been to the other side.

2145
02:00:41.920 --> 02:00:45.460
Maybe that's why you're so bluesy.
I don't know man.

2146
02:00:45.461 --> 02:00:48.370
I'm just saying it's like I just remember feeling like a very comfortable like

2147
02:00:48.371 --> 02:00:52.590
at situated ease kind of voice when you heard it and it was just like,
no,
no,

2148
02:00:52.600 --> 02:00:54.700
you would kinda,
you ain't supposed to be here.
Kind of thing.

2149
02:00:54.701 --> 02:00:55.990
Like a lot of people have said that.

2150
02:00:56.050 --> 02:00:57.730
A lot of people that have gone through that said that,

2151
02:00:57.910 --> 02:01:00.000
but you know the fractal nature of the university,

2152
02:01:00.010 --> 02:01:03.670
like I don't know why it's so weird for people to think that something happens

2153
02:01:03.671 --> 02:01:04.450
after they die.

2154
02:01:04.450 --> 02:01:07.990
Like I showed up at your GRANDPA's house too early for your own surprise party.

2155
02:01:08.050 --> 02:01:11.980
That's how it felt.
Kind of like wow.
And your grandpa was trying to be like,
Nah,

2156
02:01:12.040 --> 02:01:14.380
don't,
don't,
that's,
that's the weirdest way I can put it.

2157
02:01:14.860 --> 02:01:17.610
I wonder if what it is is just we,
we,

2158
02:01:17.630 --> 02:01:21.070
we think that this life is all there is because this is what we're experiencing,

2159
02:01:21.100 --> 02:01:23.170
but this is just a temporary blip.

2160
02:01:23.530 --> 02:01:27.760
This is this one stage and an infinite number of stages and we leave this and go

2161
02:01:27.761 --> 02:01:29.470
into the next one and we shouldn't be scared of it.
Well,

2162
02:01:29.471 --> 02:01:32.920
that's the realization that I believe most people call your life flashing before

2163
02:01:32.921 --> 02:01:36.520
your eyes is the summation that your life was like when I was laying on the

2164
02:01:36.521 --> 02:01:38.560
table and they were rolling me in for that operation,

2165
02:01:38.890 --> 02:01:41.720
I was pretty much convinced I was dying.
I was going to die.

2166
02:01:41.721 --> 02:01:45.020
There was nothing the way they were panicking and the way my chest felt and I

2167
02:01:45.021 --> 02:01:48.890
knew I was born with this thing.
I was like,
Oh wow,
I'm checking out.
This is it.

2168
02:01:49.310 --> 02:01:52.340
And like the whole time,
and it was just sitting there like it wasn't,

2169
02:01:52.370 --> 02:01:55.970
I wasn't consumed with fear.
I mean though I was,
there was,
there was fear.

2170
02:01:57.050 --> 02:01:59.750
There was just like this summation of like,

2171
02:02:01.070 --> 02:02:03.050
that's my life that quick.
Wow.

2172
02:02:03.051 --> 02:02:07.010
Everything that I've ever done is been that only that long from the minute I was

2173
02:02:07.011 --> 02:02:09.740
born to now that's it.

2174
02:02:10.300 --> 02:02:13.540
Do the things and it wouldn't have mattered if I live 40 more years.
That's,

2175
02:02:13.580 --> 02:02:18.080
that would have been the exact same realization that your whole life is so,

2176
02:02:18.560 --> 02:02:21.260
so time is irrelevant.
Time is a is an illusion.

2177
02:02:21.290 --> 02:02:26.290
Time is something we made up like we're living in and we've slowed ourselves

2178
02:02:27.351 --> 02:02:31.640
down by counting seconds.
That's interesting.
See I

2179
02:02:31.760 --> 02:02:33.350
<v 5>people always say that time is an illusion.</v>

2180
02:02:33.351 --> 02:02:36.800
That's like a very popular thing to say.
I think time's totally real,

2181
02:02:37.250 --> 02:02:38.240
but I think it doesn't matter.

2182
02:02:38.960 --> 02:02:42.830
I think the thing is so big that your idea of time is such a joke.

2183
02:02:43.220 --> 02:02:46.820
Like your idea of time is like you measuring seconds in infinity.

2184
02:02:46.850 --> 02:02:49.950
That's what I was like clinging to something that's impossible to clean too

2185
02:02:49.951 --> 02:02:53.360
because although it is real and it can be measured is also movable,

2186
02:02:53.390 --> 02:02:54.223
it doesn't matter.

2187
02:02:54.310 --> 02:02:58.050
<v 6>It's movable.
You know what I mean?
You can move time.
How can you move time in?</v>

2188
02:02:58.360 --> 02:03:00.400
I mean you,
you do it all the time.
A small increments.

2189
02:03:00.401 --> 02:03:02.440
When you like make these realizations of like

2190
02:03:03.420 --> 02:03:06.000
<v 5>all of a sudden you're somewhere.
You know what I mean?</v>

2191
02:03:06.001 --> 02:03:08.100
Just that little small realization.
These are tiny things.

2192
02:03:08.350 --> 02:03:12.180
Precepts time is perception is okay.
It's not an illusion.
It's a perception.

2193
02:03:12.210 --> 02:03:14.370
I see what you're saying.
You know what I mean?
So it's like the,

2194
02:03:14.380 --> 02:03:16.260
it's all in the way you perceive it.
You could zone,

2195
02:03:16.261 --> 02:03:19.560
I can get on a 14 hour flight to Australia and zone out and I feel like I'm

2196
02:03:19.561 --> 02:03:24.270
there in an hour.
Right.
You know?
Is that time traveling and what's also you can,

2197
02:03:24.720 --> 02:03:27.240
you know what I mean?
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
You know?
I know what you're saying.

2198
02:03:27.241 --> 02:03:28.950
I know what you're saying.
It's like you,
you are,

2199
02:03:28.951 --> 02:03:31.800
even though that this time is passing,
it's not passing for you.

2200
02:03:32.040 --> 02:03:35.910
You're going somewhere else.
So where is the as are you moving through time?

2201
02:03:35.911 --> 02:03:38.800
What are you doing?
During that time there was 17 hours on a count of four.

2202
02:03:39.120 --> 02:03:42.570
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
And you just vegetated and lost it.
Took a nap,

2203
02:03:42.900 --> 02:03:46.860
came to the,
but you know the,
to take acid a lot.
It would happen all the time.

2204
02:03:46.861 --> 02:03:48.060
I'd sit there,
take acid,

2205
02:03:48.061 --> 02:03:50.970
and I'd watch the fucking sun go down and come up and it was seemed like the

2206
02:03:50.971 --> 02:03:55.410
span of 15 minutes.
I don't think that counts.

2207
02:03:56.010 --> 02:03:58.740
I don't think that counts.
I think it's relevant.
I think it's related.

2208
02:03:58.770 --> 02:03:59.970
I don't think we'd survived Peer Review.

2209
02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:01.770
I think if you brought that to a university,
like,
look,

2210
02:04:01.771 --> 02:04:05.040
I figured out a time travel.
I dropped acid and I watched the sun.
He said,
bitch,

2211
02:04:05.340 --> 02:04:08.340
they Blake,
thank you,
Mr [inaudible].
You're,
you're closer than you think.

2212
02:04:08.341 --> 02:04:10.560
You really appreciate your contribution.
Yeah,
you're right.

2213
02:04:10.590 --> 02:04:13.620
They would say you're closer than you think because in,
in terms of infinity,

2214
02:04:14.220 --> 02:04:15.330
I mean you really did time travel.

2215
02:04:15.331 --> 02:04:19.800
If you decide to put a lot of energy on 14 hours in like God was going to end,

2216
02:04:19.950 --> 02:04:24.480
that shit will drag on forever.
Watched pot doesn't boil.
Exactly,
but it does.

2217
02:04:24.510 --> 02:04:28.180
The problem is it really does.
Doesn't it take longer?

2218
02:04:28.181 --> 02:04:31.170
It doesn't seem to take very much longer.
It seems too,

2219
02:04:31.180 --> 02:04:33.360
because you're not enjoying the experience.

2220
02:04:33.590 --> 02:04:36.960
I think everything is a matter of how much time around.

2221
02:04:37.040 --> 02:04:39.310
It's how you're using that time when you're moving it right.

2222
02:04:39.311 --> 02:04:43.860
And so in that sense,
like the more joy and love you have in your,

2223
02:04:43.861 --> 02:04:48.240
your time,
the less time feels like it's passing.
Absolutely.

2224
02:04:48.360 --> 02:04:50.490
So that's the key gaps to make things,

2225
02:04:50.491 --> 02:04:52.140
make things so they don't ever stretch out.

2226
02:04:52.260 --> 02:04:55.650
It's always like one big fun experience.

2227
02:04:56.040 --> 02:04:58.380
And so you're always time traveling.
Does that make sense?

2228
02:04:58.400 --> 02:05:01.070
<v 9>But then how would you know what fun was if there was no painful one</v>

2229
02:05:02.250 --> 02:05:05.580
<v 5>early age or get a microchip and they stick it in the back of your head.</v>

2230
02:05:06.510 --> 02:05:10.980
<v 9>So Robert Johnson special
speaking to that.</v>

2231
02:05:10.981 --> 02:05:13.410
That's a good transition to music.
We haven't done any fucking songs.

2232
02:05:14.810 --> 02:05:18.910
We're talking it up man.
Hours.
Two hours.
Yeah,

2233
02:05:18.911 --> 02:05:21.200
it's five 45 right now,
man.

2234
02:05:21.201 --> 02:05:26.201
You know he gives zero fucks and you know Everlast it's always a pleasure when

2235
02:05:26.371 --> 02:05:29.040
you come on here,
man.
It's always fun to just sit down and talk to you.

2236
02:05:29.520 --> 02:05:32.310
But you ought to promote though.
I got,
yeah,
that's what I'm saying.

2237
02:05:32.670 --> 02:05:37.410
You're here for,
you're here to have fun.
We went loud again.

2238
02:05:37.411 --> 02:05:41.120
I forgot we're on this thing.
And Mike who stick the lifestyle stick.
I got it.

2239
02:05:41.121 --> 02:05:43.340
You know,
which is kind of the Rogan audiences is,

2240
02:05:43.450 --> 02:05:47.650
is at least a more than a little responsible for this record existing.
So,

2241
02:05:48.540 --> 02:05:50.450
well listen,
I'm honored and uh,

2242
02:05:50.460 --> 02:05:53.640
I mean I've done acoustic stuff at radio stations and stuff,

2243
02:05:53.641 --> 02:05:55.020
but when I came in here and did it,

2244
02:05:55.170 --> 02:05:59.190
people started actually calling and booking shows for it.
So that's awesome.

2245
02:05:59.250 --> 02:06:02.760
And everybody said they'd buy it.
So I'm gonna hold y'all accountable.

2246
02:06:02.761 --> 02:06:06.360
Joe has like 500,000 followers,
so go get it.

2247
02:06:07.080 --> 02:06:11.710
Let's try and get everyone.
You ought to buy two of them.
Yeah,
I'm gonna,

2248
02:06:11.740 --> 02:06:16.410
I'm gonna put,
I'm gonna put that on Twitter.
I want to put it on Twitter.

2249
02:06:16.411 --> 02:06:18.060
Where can people get it?
If I put it up right now,

2250
02:06:18.061 --> 02:06:21.750
it's on iTunes or martyr Dash Inc com you will take you to all my stuff.

2251

2255
02:06:33.930 --> 02:06:34.763

a little cover,
um,</v>

2257
02:06:41.470 --> 02:06:43.480
which we're talking about some of this a little earlier,

2258
02:06:43.481 --> 02:06:47.920
but do you take requests?
If I know it,
can you do an American band?

2259
02:06:48.490 --> 02:06:49.323
No,

2260
02:06:49.690 --> 02:06:51.790
<v 5>not today.
I've been obsessed with that song.</v>

2261
02:06:51.860 --> 02:06:53.500
<v 9>Well I came back.</v>

2262
02:06:55.930 --> 02:06:57.460
I'll try and have it for you next time.

2263
02:07:00.250 --> 02:07:05.080
I'll have a very sad version of it next time
you will.

2264
02:07:05.081 --> 02:07:08.110
You'll crush my dreams.
You will man,
your attorney.

2265
02:07:08.111 --> 02:07:10.210
It's a homeless people at Junkies and shit.

2266
02:07:11.050 --> 02:07:14.170
<v 6>Beautiful.
What are we going to do here?</v>

2267
02:07:31.150 --> 02:07:34.980
<v 9>Soon as yo make you feel,

2268
02:07:37.850 --> 02:07:40.070

2269
02:07:45.870 --> 02:07:47.920
Pain is so big that you

2270
02:07:52.980 --> 02:07:54.250
working class,

2271
02:08:00.280 --> 02:08:01.570
working class

2272
02:08:26.650 --> 02:08:29.520
so fucking crazy.
You can't find them

2273
02:08:37.250 --> 02:08:38.083
being

2274
02:08:41.610 --> 02:08:43.330
working class.

2275
02:09:00.990 --> 02:09:02.290
They expect you

2276
02:09:07.950 --> 02:09:09.680
can't even function.

2277
02:09:21.180 --> 02:09:22.340
Working class

2278
02:09:34.050 --> 02:09:34.883
built

2279
02:09:42.160 --> 02:09:46.040
so clever
and

2280
02:09:48.270 --> 02:09:49.960
I'll fucking

2281
02:09:56.340 --> 02:09:57.630
working class.

2282
02:10:19.950 --> 02:10:20.783
Sadly.

2283
02:10:38.300 --> 02:10:41.510
New Loan,
lack of folks on the hill

2284
02:10:45.370 --> 02:10:46.540
working class,

2285
02:10:52.600 --> 02:10:53.830
working class.

2286
02:11:00.500 --> 02:11:02.860
You don't file

2287
02:11:09.130 --> 02:11:10.130
come from

2288
02:11:14.650 --> 02:11:15.483
no

2289
02:11:21.180 --> 02:11:24.900
<v 5>fucking bad ass.
Holy Shit.
That's my favorite version of that song.</v>

2290
02:11:25.080 --> 02:11:28.820
That was beautiful.
Somebody actually from your crew,
uh,

2291
02:11:29.560 --> 02:11:33.150
peoples and my peoples on my Twitter I think requested that last time.

2292
02:11:33.210 --> 02:11:37.020
I said that's not a bad idea too.
That's my favorite song now.

2293
02:11:37.530 --> 02:11:42.510
That was beautiful.
It was a John Lennon got damn.
He was a bad mother fucker.

2294
02:11:42.511 --> 02:11:44.790
John Lennon,
he wrote some interesting stuff,
man.
That's all.

2295
02:11:44.800 --> 02:11:47.670
What the Yoga Oh thing.
Now how'd that happen?
I don't know.

2296
02:11:47.671 --> 02:11:50.750
But this dude show me that.
What's,
what's happened?
What's your marijuana?
Yes.

2297
02:11:54.050 --> 02:11:57.290
Played it twice already.
We can't,
oh,
I wasn't mad.

2298
02:11:58.110 --> 02:12:00.600
I knew of that comedian guy now.
I was always fair to funny,

2299
02:12:00.601 --> 02:12:05.190
but I never heard that the Yoko Ono bit until he showed us his bill brown man.

2300
02:12:05.400 --> 02:12:08.820
Guys on camera.
So important to me.
Very like 10 of them.

2301
02:12:09.540 --> 02:12:10.980
10 of them didn't have that good that are,

2302
02:12:10.981 --> 02:12:14.160
that are out there that points it out like that and are honest about how they

2303
02:12:14.161 --> 02:12:18.870
feel about shit.
Like his,
his,
his take on John Leno.
I'm like,
you fucking crazy.

2304
02:12:18.871 --> 02:12:21.000
Cut.
Why you yell it out?
I'm here.
I'm here.

2305
02:12:21.040 --> 02:12:24.330
Single Chunk fucking and you can't leave me alone.

2306
02:12:26.310 --> 02:12:30.150
It's so funny.
So funny.
Bill Burns.
Beautiful.

2307
02:12:30.720 --> 02:12:33.810
He's beautiful.
So because like that is so important.

2308
02:12:34.470 --> 02:12:39.330
Joey Diaz has his fucking take on the candelabra movie.
The,
the,

2309
02:12:39.331 --> 02:12:40.800
the,
uh,
the Liberace movie.

2310
02:12:41.070 --> 02:12:44.010
It is what the funniest fucking thing I've ever seen in my life.

2311
02:12:44.310 --> 02:12:47.880
You got to see Joey Diaz has bid on it.
It is so fun.
I've been to,
is it?
Oh No,
no,

2312
02:12:47.881 --> 02:12:50.820
no,
no.
He has,
I don't think he's put it on anything.
It's so funny.

2313
02:12:50.821 --> 02:12:55.290
It hurts my ball.
I haven't seen it yet.
I got to check it out.
Oh,

2314
02:12:55.291 --> 02:12:59.490
it's beautiful.
It's brilliant.
And it's beautiful.
It really is beautiful.

2315
02:12:59.491 --> 02:13:00.600
And that's like,
you know,

2316
02:13:00.870 --> 02:13:04.890
saying that about a movie that's about a gay dude who's a gay pub who's just

2317
02:13:04.950 --> 02:13:08.010
given these dudes amphetamines and banging up and playing piano and making

2318
02:13:08.011 --> 02:13:12.930
hundreds of billions of dollars just running it.
He was a bad mother fucker.
Dude.

2319
02:13:12.990 --> 02:13:16.980
Liberace was a the,
but that was his game.
That's what he did.

2320
02:13:16.981 --> 02:13:21.360
He paid for the surgery.
He made his boyfriend get surgery.
So he looks like him.

2321
02:13:21.660 --> 02:13:25.080
Do you know how gangster that is?
Like he made the guy get a chin implant,

2322
02:13:25.320 --> 02:13:28.800
so he looks like Liberace.
Ooh,

2323
02:13:30.300 --> 02:13:32.050
that's so heavy.
You want to see of a free

2324
02:13:32.050 --> 02:13:33.840
<v 3>shout.
Want to see this?</v>

2325
02:13:33.900 --> 02:13:38.730
You could put on that video when Liberace winks at me cause you know for the

2326
02:13:38.731 --> 02:13:40.080
longest time I've played this before,

2327
02:13:40.081 --> 02:13:43.650
I apologize to people who have heard this podcast and they listen to everyone

2328
02:13:43.700 --> 02:13:45.240
that goes,
you got to pull it out.
Focus on again,

2329
02:13:45.510 --> 02:13:47.400
the only reason being is cause Everlast is here.

2330
02:13:47.401 --> 02:13:50.760
I just want you to see from a cultural standpoint how strange things must have

2331
02:13:50.761 --> 02:13:54.660
been in the 1950s where this was like a real thing.
There was a woman,

2332
02:13:54.661 --> 02:13:58.980
she's writing a letter to the Liberace fan club because she's a huge fan of

2333
02:13:58.981 --> 02:14:03.510
Liberace now.
And she goes crazy and swoons when Liberace winks at her.

2334
02:14:03.870 --> 02:14:07.500
And so there's Liberace playing piano on the TV and she's sitting there writing

2335
02:14:07.501 --> 02:14:10.170
her letter and swooning and look at this.

2336
02:14:14.380 --> 02:14:18.910
<v 1>The shit was only 60 years ago.
I found a brand new eye.</v>

2337
02:14:35.100 --> 02:14:36.240
No Watch.
Many weeks

2338
02:14:46.120 --> 02:14:50.170
are you gonna play along?
Brian,
check this.
We get this wink.

2339
02:14:56.250 --> 02:14:57.340
Not a weird noise.

2340
02:14:59.890 --> 02:15:03.620
Sounds like a computer made it though.
No,
it's just a chip.

2341
02:15:05.010 --> 02:15:05.843
Yeah.

2342
02:15:05.870 --> 02:15:10.730
Well let's just the additive in ancient fucking system on wax.

2343
02:15:15.490 --> 02:15:18.360
You can come back.
No,
there's no way.
Check this.

2344
02:15:18.430 --> 02:15:20.710
He's going to wake up again though.
I guarantee Ya.
He said

2345
02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:27.160
that he was like a matinee idol and you came across this.
Why?
I know because I,

2346
02:15:27.310 --> 02:15:29.200
well I got really obsessed with the movie

2347
02:15:29.200 --> 02:15:31.660
<v 3>movie.
I saw the movie.
Well I didn't even see the movie.</v>

2348
02:15:31.690 --> 02:15:34.610
I said Joey does talk about the movie first.
And then I,

2349
02:15:34.840 --> 02:15:36.610
I see him talking about it backstage like,

2350
02:15:36.640 --> 02:15:39.640
well he was in the green room and we were dying laughing when he was talking

2351
02:15:39.641 --> 02:15:44.250
about Liberace slinging a dick.
You're like hypnotizing motherfuckers going.

2352
02:15:44.380 --> 02:15:47.530
And it was so funny.
I had to watch the bit.
And so then he did this bit about it.

2353
02:15:47.680 --> 02:15:51.530
So the bit,
it's just ridiculous.
It's,
it's Matt Damon Liberace.
I mean it's,

2354
02:15:51.531 --> 02:15:54.220
it's a fucking,
it's an unbelievably hilarious bit.

2355
02:15:54.280 --> 02:15:57.160
So then I watched the movie and it was like,
Oh shit,
this is a good movie man.

2356
02:15:57.370 --> 02:15:58.900
Like this is an interesting story.

2357
02:15:59.080 --> 02:16:04.080
So young guy who fell for the chimes of an old rich gay guy and he just got

2358
02:16:04.511 --> 02:16:07.810
gangster with him and he's just there taking pills and he's,

2359
02:16:08.170 --> 02:16:12.010
he's got a pump fucking pump that keeps his dick hard.
So he's hard all the time.

2360
02:16:12.011 --> 02:16:16.780
You can never get satisfied.
[inaudible] was just,
he was a madman,

2361
02:16:16.810 --> 02:16:20.090
just a madman.
He had a thing stuck.

2362
02:16:20.120 --> 02:16:22.990
He'll was like a thing on his dick where you just get his dick hard anytime you

2363
02:16:22.991 --> 02:16:27.820
want.
So we just pumped that bitch up.
God bless him.

2364
02:16:28.740 --> 02:16:30.970
I got to this flag.
Oh,
it's a beautiful flick.

2365
02:16:31.180 --> 02:16:34.690
So then I started getting interested in Liberace and started researching all

2366
02:16:34.691 --> 02:16:37.570
this shit about Liberace and we'll start winking at you when I'm playing over

2367
02:16:37.571 --> 02:16:40.210
here.
Hey listen man,
I'm not homophobic.
I'm,
I'm,

2368
02:16:40.220 --> 02:16:43.720
I'm interested in human beings and strange human characters.
And that was a,

2369
02:16:43.721 --> 02:16:45.400
an incredibly strange human character.

2370
02:16:45.520 --> 02:16:49.480
And the only thing that kept me from looking into him in the past was like that

2371
02:16:49.481 --> 02:16:53.050
weirdness about like doing a lot of research on a gay guy.
Like a really,

2372
02:16:53.070 --> 02:16:55.030
obviously,
why you pick,
why do you care about gay guys?

2373
02:16:55.031 --> 02:16:57.370
Why don't you care about gay guys?
Like he's just a human.

2374
02:16:57.610 --> 02:16:59.620
I want to know like what made that human.

2375
02:16:59.710 --> 02:17:02.530
He was like a Alpha gay piano like gay guy.

2376
02:17:03.500 --> 02:17:08.260
He made like $1 billion playing a fucking piano.
Who does that?
Who does that?

2377
02:17:08.920 --> 02:17:10.930
That's what I want to know.
And he was,

2378
02:17:11.020 --> 02:17:13.210
and he was a gangster when it came to his work ethic.

2379
02:17:13.211 --> 02:17:17.620
He was doing multiple shows in Vegas multiple per night,
you know?
And,

2380
02:17:17.650 --> 02:17:22.060
and he was a bad mother fucker.
Past performance made a guy change his face.

2381
02:17:22.180 --> 02:17:24.920
He used to come out with gigantic mink coats.
Look,

2382
02:17:24.950 --> 02:17:29.170
a thousand sables wrapped around his body playing.
We see those coats.

2383
02:17:29.320 --> 02:17:33.070
Oh my goodness.
He had fucking,
it just,
he was the original gangster rapper.

2384
02:17:33.460 --> 02:17:38.440
Nobody had like jewelry.
Nobody had more blank than Liberace.
He was the original,

2385
02:17:38.530 --> 02:17:41.680
the Gangsta rap.
He's that rapper.
He's the gangster rappers.

2386
02:17:41.860 --> 02:17:45.720
They copied Liberace
first.

2387
02:17:45.721 --> 02:17:48.580
Then Mr all the,
all the bboy jewelry stuff,
man.

2388
02:17:48.610 --> 02:17:52.780
And even probably Liberace stouts certainly comes from old Jewish ladies,
man.

2389
02:17:55.510 --> 02:17:59.500
Cause owl glasses.
True big gold rope chains,
all that shit.

2390
02:17:59.501 --> 02:18:03.020
It was like old Jewish ladies would rock this fine jewelry back in New York and

2391
02:18:03.100 --> 02:18:07.480
that's like,
it was like,
it was the good shit.
It was the night shit.
So that's,

2392
02:18:07.630 --> 02:18:11.800
yeah man.
I mean like,
wow.
That actually makes sense.
I mean,
that's hilarious.

2393
02:18:11.820 --> 02:18:13.880
Dressed like Kool moe Dee though.
What about those?
Well,

2394
02:18:13.900 --> 02:18:18.480
those were just crazy glasses,
man.
I got to work

2395
02:18:20.820 --> 02:18:23.520
one of the greats though.
Oh,
without a doubt.
Dude.

2396
02:18:23.530 --> 02:18:26.800
I go to work is a fucking bad ass jam.
This doctor,

2397
02:18:28.900 --> 02:18:31.330
Kool Moe Dee was a real innovator,
you know,

2398
02:18:31.331 --> 02:18:35.860
out of those dudes that were around then.
The most amazing to me is Nas.

2399
02:18:36.130 --> 02:18:40.840
Nas is never stopped being relevant at wall Kumanti's a little bit before Nas,

2400
02:18:40.841 --> 02:18:43.930
but yeah.
But I love those like eighties and nineties guys.

2401
02:18:44.330 --> 02:18:49.120
When was right?
I was like early nineties early nineties yeah.

2402
02:18:49.360 --> 02:18:53.200
Hmm.
What was this?
Swimming nozzles are still young.
Like he,
Oh yes.

2403
02:18:53.201 --> 02:18:57.640
First record came out and he was like 1617 years old.
He doesn't age.

2404
02:18:58.060 --> 02:19:02.830
He looks good for his age.
He's only 39 wow.
That's amazing.
Really,

2405
02:19:02.831 --> 02:19:04.240
I would thought he was leaving a little younger than that,

2406
02:19:04.870 --> 02:19:06.130
but I was pretty young back then too,

2407
02:19:06.131 --> 02:19:10.150
so it makes sense when I was like 20 something he was running.

2408
02:19:10.180 --> 02:19:14.740
What is it about rappers that like very few of them are like Jay z that like

2409
02:19:14.741 --> 02:19:19.450
have this longevity and keep producing more wrapped as relevant.

2410
02:19:19.630 --> 02:19:21.670
Like some of them they get big and then they fall off.

2411
02:19:21.671 --> 02:19:25.240
Is that like record deal type shit?
Like what is that?
Pop Music's that way.

2412
02:19:25.270 --> 02:19:28.040
Pop Music.
Yeah,
there's a lot of fall.
Even with those like

2413
02:19:28.040 --> 02:19:30.680
<v 8>doo-wop bands back in the day,
everyone only remembers like</v>

2414
02:19:31.200 --> 02:19:34.920
<v 6>carrot,
like Jay too.
They,
he started completely either he started independently,</v>

2415
02:19:35.040 --> 02:19:38.850
someone his own records and then came into the record business as his own full

2416
02:19:38.851 --> 02:19:40.820
partner,
lollies cancers.

2417
02:19:40.910 --> 02:19:44.430
Like they got what's called a three 60 deal nowadays.

2418
02:19:44.431 --> 02:19:48.120
Like the label gets everything.
They get your merchandising,
they get your,

2419
02:19:48.360 --> 02:19:51.870
you know,
every rights they get pieces of your toying back.

2420
02:19:51.871 --> 02:19:55.980
When I sign record deals back in the day,
like I,
I'm,
I'm my own label now.

2421
02:19:55.981 --> 02:19:59.520
I do my own thing.
I'm completely independent.
But when we had made,

2422
02:19:59.521 --> 02:20:01.080
when I used to do major label deals,

2423
02:20:01.170 --> 02:20:04.230
I didn't have to give them anything but a record.
You know what I mean?

2424
02:20:04.250 --> 02:20:06.990
Right now they want you publishing,
they want it,
you're touring,

2425
02:20:06.991 --> 02:20:10.560
they want your merchandise and touring 10 cause nobody buys records.

2426
02:20:10.860 --> 02:20:13.580
You know what I mean?
And people buy singles,
nobody buys albums anymore.

2427
02:20:13.580 --> 02:20:17.550
So if they came along right now does the only deals that are available pretty

2428
02:20:17.551 --> 02:20:19.950
much,
unless you got something going on already,

2429
02:20:19.980 --> 02:20:23.160
like unless you already have developed yourself a scene and you're making,

2430
02:20:23.161 --> 02:20:25.260
if you're earning on your own level,

2431
02:20:25.410 --> 02:20:28.330
I'm sure you can go work yourself a deal somewhere and had a musicians.

2432
02:20:28.380 --> 02:20:29.600
But if you're doing that nowadays,

2433
02:20:29.640 --> 02:20:32.070
it's like you almost don't even want to do that.
You know almost.

2434
02:20:32.071 --> 02:20:35.880
It's like for every advantage there is to have that million dollar,

2435
02:20:35.940 --> 02:20:38.600
billion dollar machine behind you with the,
you know,
there's some,
there's,

2436
02:20:38.650 --> 02:20:40.130
there's disadvantages to it,
you know what I mean?

2437
02:20:40.470 --> 02:20:43.200
Well it seems like I can't do what are,
you can't do what you want.

2438
02:20:43.280 --> 02:20:47.570
<v 8>I know of groups that have like a,
I know a group that the guy,
the head singer,</v>

2439
02:20:47.571 --> 02:20:50.090
it's a group fits into tantrums in this head singer,

2440
02:20:50.091 --> 02:20:53.870
like supposedly just saved up a bunch of money and use his life savings to

2441
02:20:54.080 --> 02:20:57.740
spearhead his group.
He funded it himself,
they hit the road,
they played,

2442
02:20:57.920 --> 02:21:01.700
he hired good musicians,
you know,
shout out to James King,
uh,

2443
02:21:01.730 --> 02:21:06.710
like he just got good people on it and they'd just tour,
tour,
tour,
tour,

2444
02:21:06.890 --> 02:21:10.160
tour.
They did another album,
the song,
got a little radio,

2445
02:21:10.161 --> 02:21:14.300
love hearing their Internet love.
Now,
you know,
it just goes from there.

2446
02:21:14.301 --> 02:21:16.490
But if you're just like some,
nobody,
you know,

2447
02:21:16.491 --> 02:21:20.210
you're doing like pageants or something like that,
you know,
whatever.

2448
02:21:20.211 --> 02:21:23.120
And you want to be famous,
it's like they're going to be like,
Whoa,

2449
02:21:23.750 --> 02:21:25.650
<v 6>what are they trying to do in the music business?
Right?</v>

2450
02:21:25.660 --> 02:21:30.530
So if you try and do like star search
and may want to be rich and famous,

2451
02:21:30.531 --> 02:21:34.940
you're not doing,
you're not going out and grinding it out for 10 years.

2452
02:21:35.890 --> 02:21:36.920
You want to reach,
you're famous,

2453
02:21:36.921 --> 02:21:39.270
you're taking whichever route you can pass the tracker.

2454
02:21:39.560 --> 02:21:42.050
But that shit doesn't work right in order to get good.

2455
02:21:42.070 --> 02:21:44.040
It kind of had with jasmine.
My like a lot of them cats.

2456
02:21:44.070 --> 02:21:46.940
That's what happens though.
You know they get turned out by labels,

2457
02:21:46.941 --> 02:21:48.920
the labels done with them.
They're not hiding any more labels.

2458
02:21:49.240 --> 02:21:53.600
They stop supporting them.
Jay Z is a self supporting like entity.

2459
02:21:53.630 --> 02:21:57.310
If the labeled after him behind he,
he,
he is the label.
He can't be left.

2460
02:21:57.320 --> 02:21:59.810
Do you release all your own stuff?
You own all your lifestyle now?

2461
02:21:59.811 --> 02:22:01.970
I mean I didn't early on but the last few albums,

2462
02:22:01.971 --> 02:22:05.930
yeah I just do all my own stuff or these kind of like so beautiful and it gets a

2463
02:22:05.931 --> 02:22:08.090
little better every year.
You know more than your dorm.

2464
02:22:08.270 --> 02:22:10.420
The fans is going to tell other people there,
you know,

2465
02:22:10.850 --> 02:22:13.610
I'm still alive and you know,
and then I'm still making good music.

2466
02:22:13.611 --> 02:22:17.760
Then they can only sell a few more records and you know what I mean?
If you wink,

2467
02:22:20.170 --> 02:22:23.690
I have her last week said me,
maybe you should cover that.

2468
02:22:24.890 --> 02:22:27.730
Well you'd have to issue the girl version.
That doesn't make sense.

2469
02:22:27.731 --> 02:22:31.410
That's a girl song.
Maybe you could do a version where it check is talking,

2470
02:22:31.560 --> 02:22:34.650
singing and you're playing guitar now for the shut the fuck up.

2471
02:22:36.640 --> 02:22:39.180
There's no way to get away from that songs.
It was good.

2472
02:22:39.181 --> 02:22:43.470
You stepped away that gay and everything's wrong with it.
It's a mess.

2473
02:22:43.920 --> 02:22:46.470
It's a mess.
The poor girls and he's like,
what's happening there?

2474
02:22:46.471 --> 02:22:49.840
It's a strange fucking video.
I'm thinking it was Judy garland too.

2475
02:22:49.841 --> 02:22:52.290
That's the crazy thing.
She had that look about it right?

2476
02:22:52.320 --> 02:22:54.990
That innocent 1950s woman look,

2477
02:22:55.280 --> 02:22:58.380
it's definitely like a wannabe Judy garland thing going on there and they

2478
02:22:58.381 --> 02:22:59.700
thought they were so sophisticated.

2479
02:22:59.820 --> 02:23:03.900
They were so much further ahead in the mon goals or American Indians or any

2480
02:23:03.950 --> 02:23:08.820
people before the 1950s that's 50 years away from the 18 hundreds bitch age of

2481
02:23:08.850 --> 02:23:10.050
innocence,
right?
Yeah.

2482
02:23:10.080 --> 02:23:15.080
And we had separate but equal is that the 1950s was only 50 years away from 1899

2483
02:23:17.130 --> 02:23:20.370
I mean that shit is like pioneer days,
you know.

2484
02:23:21.480 --> 02:23:25.040
So young asks society and coke.
Yeah,

2485
02:23:25.380 --> 02:23:27.720
cocaine was in cocaine,
cocaine,

2486
02:23:30.540 --> 02:23:31.290
cocaine in it.

2487
02:23:31.290 --> 02:23:35.280
Did you know that Coca Cola is still uses coca leaves and they process them to

2488
02:23:35.281 --> 02:23:39.480
make Coca Cola and they use the cocaine from those coca leaves for medical

2489
02:23:39.481 --> 02:23:42.930
cocaine.
They,
there's a company that,
that process for them.

2490
02:23:43.320 --> 02:23:47.310
They're like the biggest producer of medical cocaine we've had.
We've been,

2491
02:23:47.311 --> 02:23:48.890
we've tried to talk about when we're talking about,

2492
02:23:48.930 --> 02:23:50.250
I talked about the documentary,

2493
02:23:50.490 --> 02:23:53.640
which ones is a crazy documentary about coca cola and South America being

2494
02:23:53.641 --> 02:23:58.110
involved in all these like hit like sanctioned hits and fucking like guerrilla

2495
02:23:58.111 --> 02:24:00.000
warfare and shit down there.
What was the name of it?

2496
02:24:00.001 --> 02:24:03.340
Do you remember the document like the Coca Cola cases or the Coke Cola files and

2497
02:24:03.570 --> 02:24:08.130
here let's shut it down again.
Document documentary,
heaven.com money dude.

2498
02:24:08.550 --> 02:24:12.000
It's all about,
it's too much money in coke.
How are you going to pass up on that?

2499
02:24:12.001 --> 02:24:14.250
That's how the CIA got involved.
They're like,
come on.

2500
02:24:14.251 --> 02:24:18.360
It's so much money bread down there,
man.
You got to sell at someone's buying it.

2501
02:24:18.361 --> 02:24:23.220
Jesus Christ.
So I just started doing it.
Supply and demand.
It is right,
right.

2502
02:24:25.410 --> 02:24:28.140
Illmatic was 94 that's when not started.
Yeah.
So yeah,

2503
02:24:28.200 --> 02:24:30.660
but he has first record was like a year or two before that.

2504
02:24:30.661 --> 02:24:34.410
I called live at the barbecue on main sources album.
So that was like 93 I think.

2505
02:24:34.440 --> 02:24:39.270
Yeah,
maybe even 92.
Yeah.
He's got the most interesting lyrics.

2506
02:24:39.970 --> 02:24:41.910
It's got really strange lyrics.
You know,

2507
02:24:41.940 --> 02:24:45.060
like that one song from Stillmatic where he plays it in reverse,

2508
02:24:45.960 --> 02:24:49.860
you know the song like the,
the scenario plays out in reverse,
isn't it?

2509
02:24:49.920 --> 02:24:52.920
It's a song about being a gun.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What does that song,

2510
02:24:52.921 --> 02:24:56.850
I think it's called I'm a gun.
Oh really?
Something like,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,

2511
02:24:56.880 --> 02:24:59.010
I don't think so.
Uh,
rewind.
It's called reward.

2512
02:25:00.030 --> 02:25:03.900
Got Yourself a gun is the sound,
but isn't the story about being,

2513
02:25:03.910 --> 02:25:07.580
he has a song as a story about him actually being a gun?
Hm.

2514
02:25:08.490 --> 02:25:13.350
I believe it.
No.
I don't know.
Maybe a nats on that.

2515
02:25:13.450 --> 02:25:16.650
Stillmatic I don't know.
I'm one of his other ones are,

2516
02:25:17.130 --> 02:25:19.200
all those records are on a hard drive now.
So it's like,

2517
02:25:19.201 --> 02:25:23.440
not even like an album categories,
it's just a list of not song.
So yeah,

2518
02:25:23.441 --> 02:25:24.550
that's this.
I mean,

2519
02:25:24.551 --> 02:25:29.410
how many physical cds gets sold now and how many get sold digitally?

2520
02:25:29.690 --> 02:25:34.390
Um,
the people still want this more than you would think.
It's pretty dope.

2521
02:25:34.720 --> 02:25:36.360
I love the artwork.
Life Acoustics.

2522
02:25:36.940 --> 02:25:41.940
Tristan Eaton did all the artwork we just ripped off in a Wes Anderson movie and

2523
02:25:42.790 --> 02:25:46.240
yeah,
but it's beautiful.
It's a tribute tribute.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2524
02:25:46.241 --> 02:25:49.630
No one's gonna like get confused.
I mean,
you use the same font.
I mean everyone,

2525
02:25:49.631 --> 02:25:50.740
it's,
but it's really cool.

2526
02:25:50.770 --> 02:25:54.430
I don't think anybody thinks a movie's going to be in my and my CD there.
No.

2527
02:25:54.431 --> 02:25:59.200
And it's a,
it's a cool name.
I love it.
So,
uh,
but next,
um,

2528
02:25:59.260 --> 02:26:02.110
what about jumping around says jump around on here,
man,

2529
02:26:02.830 --> 02:26:05.740
but we don't really have the drum.
That situation worked out here.

2530
02:26:05.741 --> 02:26:08.710
We can do it without drums.
I go,
no,
no,
no.
Don't do anything you don't want to do.

2531
02:26:09.670 --> 02:26:10.510
Not wanting to.

2532
02:26:10.511 --> 02:26:13.690
I just think it would be a little bit better if we had a drum thing.

2533
02:26:13.710 --> 02:26:15.760
Worked out main,
do whatever you want to do.

2534
02:26:15.820 --> 02:26:17.860
I want to hear whatever you want to do.
Shit,
man,

2535
02:26:17.861 --> 02:26:21.520
I wouldn't want you telling me what Joe's to do.
I would forget how they go.

2536
02:26:22.590 --> 02:26:25.830
<v 9>By the way.
My Twitter handle is right in the banger.

2537
02:26:25.831 --> 02:26:30.540

2539
02:26:33.660 --> 02:26:36.420

Right.
And then the Banger,

2542
02:26:43.291 --> 02:26:47.960
cause like all the famous djs sounded all like Dutch and stuff.

like I would like to yesto yeah,
they just have these crazy European names.

2544
02:26:51.091 --> 02:26:55.200
So I was like,
oh,
just make it sound like different ideas.
Famous djs are,

2545
02:26:55.201 --> 02:27:00.080
because the famous Tj like Paul Van Dyke or whatever,
you know,

2554
02:27:30.200 --> 02:27:35.000
I used to do a couple where I've heard all the silly nicknames like paid to Pano

2555
02:27:35.050 --> 02:27:37.660
who was a famous Jujitsu guy.

2576
02:29:55.140 --> 02:29:57.410
It's not really been you.

2577
02:30:06.730 --> 02:30:07.563

She left the sweetest sound.

2580
02:31:12.940 --> 02:31:17.230
Matches love the way that she lit up.
She spoke,

2581
02:31:19.170 --> 02:31:23.040
she helped ease my pain.
She states

2582
02:31:27.210 --> 02:31:30.200
that she could say until Shit Bro.

2583
02:31:35.160 --> 02:31:39.000
Shit

<v 6>Mr Brian Velazco on the keys.
Black beauty,</v>

2590
02:32:45.910 --> 02:32:49.600
black beauty.
Give it up.
Raven door banger.

2591
02:32:50.080 --> 02:32:54.270
Stop doing that.
So that's a great song.
Hey,

2592
02:32:54.340 --> 02:32:56.740
how was off of a record called eat at Wendy's?

2593
02:32:59.560 --> 02:33:00.281
And,
uh,
you're,

2594
02:33:00.281 --> 02:33:03.040
you're putting this out and then you're going to work on a studio album right

2595
02:33:03.041 --> 02:33:06.840
now I been,
I've been,
it's kind of a hip hoppers thing.
It's slow going because,

2596
02:33:06.890 --> 02:33:11.560
um,
it's,
it's,
it's very particular project.
It's kind of weird,
but it's going to,

2597
02:33:11.561 --> 02:33:16.180
so the beauty of this is there could be a volume one,
volume two,
volume three.

2598
02:33:16.990 --> 02:33:20.110
It's easy to go in the studio and cut the acoustic versions.
It's fun too.

2599
02:33:20.170 --> 02:33:24.550
So yeah.
Must be nice to have like things paired down to oh yeah,

2600
02:33:24.551 --> 02:33:27.550
it makes traveling so easy dude.
Oh I'm sure.
Right.

2601
02:33:27.910 --> 02:33:30.670
Do you just show up with a guitar?
Like how do you do it?
Oh it's three.

2602
02:33:30.700 --> 02:33:31.920
Just the way we show up here with,

2603
02:33:31.990 --> 02:33:35.020
but we don't even need to bring this cause most places will have a keyboard for

2604
02:33:35.021 --> 02:33:38.800
us.
Ah,
that's nice.
Right.
It's normally two guitars and three guys.

2605
02:33:39.280 --> 02:33:42.940
Like if you are in a big band,
like a big crazy band,

2606
02:33:43.180 --> 02:33:47.140
like how much shit did they have?
Like let's say like if we got to go full gear,

2607
02:33:47.200 --> 02:33:51.140
what's a big band?
What's a band of travels big like obviously,
um,
you too.

2608
02:33:51.300 --> 02:33:55.630
Oh they got semi trucks cause they have at least two,

2609
02:33:55.780 --> 02:33:57.550
three dimensional show,
right?
Yeah.

2610
02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:00.880
I mean they're carrying their own lighting rigs and their own sound systems in

2611
02:34:00.881 --> 02:34:04.720
their own,
you know what I mean?
Come on.
Does it take to set that shit up the day?

2612
02:34:07.600 --> 02:34:11.620
Wow.
You know,
they say Kevin Hart has like a,

2613
02:34:11.621 --> 02:34:15.850
he's got an acoustic system that he has an explosive system that he has set up

2614
02:34:15.851 --> 02:34:18.250
for his shows.
He shows me his punchlines

2615
02:34:18.280 --> 02:34:21.470
<v 5>explosions go off behind the technique.
How that goes.</v>

2616
02:34:22.690 --> 02:34:27.670
How bad asses that.
Ooh,
that's pretty dope.
No one can copy that either.

2617
02:34:27.850 --> 02:34:29.230
That shits his,
that's like,

2618
02:34:29.231 --> 02:34:32.830
if you want to smash a watermelon with a Sledge Hammer,
too late as Gallagher,

2619
02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:35.230
too late.
You know,
it's not like playing the drums.

2620
02:34:35.500 --> 02:34:38.230
There's certain specific things that you're not allowed to repeat if you want to

2621
02:34:38.231 --> 02:34:40.570
get shot in the dig with like a pool ball.

2622
02:34:42.250 --> 02:34:47.200
Well like you know,
rock stars can do pyrotechnics and they can also,

2623
02:34:47.201 --> 02:34:49.360
like other rock stars could do power techniques.

2624
02:34:49.570 --> 02:34:52.690
But there's never been a comedian that does pyrotechnics until Kevin did it.

2625
02:34:52.780 --> 02:34:57.550
So now that's it.
It's only Kevin.
Even though he didn't invent pyrotechnics,

2626
02:34:57.610 --> 02:34:58.443
he owns it.

2627
02:34:58.530 --> 02:35:02.330
<v 9>They literally go off on punchline and I will like suck it.
Bitch</v>

2628
02:35:06.150 --> 02:35:11.000
is fucking great.
I wish I made even at like a shitty joke.
Good.
That's cheating.

2629
02:35:13.160 --> 02:35:17.110
Why'd the chicken cross the road?
Because as dick was too long,
boom.

2630
02:35:19.910 --> 02:35:21.500
You just want to see that explosion.

2631
02:35:22.490 --> 02:35:26.660
<v 5>Yeah,
but he's funny too.
So on top of that,
I mean that must be a destruction man.</v>

2632
02:35:26.920 --> 02:35:29.120
It must be destruction.
It's a brilliant idea,

2633
02:35:29.630 --> 02:35:31.190
but I think you've got to do something.

2634
02:35:31.191 --> 02:35:33.380
If you're going to do 18,000 people with comedy,

2635
02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:36.470
comedy is supposed to be honestly 200 people.

2636
02:35:36.550 --> 02:35:40.250
Word Clay never did nothing like that.
Thanks clay.
Never did.
It might have I,

2637
02:35:40.251 --> 02:35:43.880
you know,
we need to ask him,
did he ever have explosions?
He might've,

2638
02:35:43.910 --> 02:35:47.330
he had some gigantic,
if anybody did it,
clay might might've done it.

2639
02:35:47.360 --> 02:35:48.740
I don't think he had them on punch lines,

2640
02:35:48.741 --> 02:35:52.430
but I think he might've come out to them or such lines.
That kind of wild.
Yeah.

2641
02:35:52.460 --> 02:35:53.540
But yeah,
he was,

2642
02:35:53.780 --> 02:35:58.190
I think he was probably the first comedian to do those kinds of places

2643
02:35:58.191 --> 02:35:58.941
consistently.

2644
02:35:58.941 --> 02:36:03.620
I think maybe Steve Martin had done some arenas and Eddie Murphy had done some

2645
02:36:03.621 --> 02:36:06.440
arenas and Richard Pryor probably did some arenas,

2646
02:36:06.800 --> 02:36:11.620
but when dice came on the scene,
like it was all arenas.
Tours.
Yeah,

2647
02:36:11.750 --> 02:36:12.410
he was the first,

2648
02:36:12.410 --> 02:36:16.220
he was a totally different kind of comedian because he was like a musician.

2649
02:36:16.520 --> 02:36:19.700
Like people wanted to hear his shit.
They wanted to hear the same shit again.

2650
02:36:19.850 --> 02:36:23.450
Watson,
the ball bitch.
He was like,
I'll do it with him.

2651
02:36:23.740 --> 02:36:24.910
It was like singing along to freeway

2652
02:36:25.150 --> 02:36:28.480
<v 9>was reminisce of like if you,
if you remember those old like Monte Python,</v>

2653
02:36:28.481 --> 02:36:29.620
when they took that on the road,

2654
02:36:29.621 --> 02:36:33.850
all they wanted to see was the old sketches so they could like sing along to the

2655
02:36:34.600 --> 02:36:38.860
merely a flesh wound.
Flesh.
That's funny.
Is that what they did?
I don't,

2656
02:36:38.861 --> 02:36:39.970
I'm not even aware of that though.

2657
02:36:40.240 --> 02:36:44.980
They do famous live like DVD of him Monty python at the Hollywood bowl.

2658
02:36:44.981 --> 02:36:45.720
It's hilarious.

2659
02:36:45.720 --> 02:36:49.950
<v 5>Wow.
Well that makes sense.
Yeah.
Well yeah,
I guess</v>

2660
02:36:50.330 --> 02:36:53.460
<v 9>I'm a lumberjack and I'm okay and the whole audience to sing in the shit.</v>

2661
02:36:53.490 --> 02:36:55.440
It's like all they did was the shift from the shows.

2662
02:36:55.441 --> 02:36:59.040
I'm embarrassed to say I was never a money python fan.
Really?
I like that.

2663
02:36:59.320 --> 02:37:01.230
I didn't like it.
I just never really watched that.

2664
02:37:01.231 --> 02:37:05.670
I never was in a band so money by,
so in bands he just became a mic.

2665
02:37:05.671 --> 02:37:08.700
I thought sort of like all these bands nerdy.

2666
02:37:08.701 --> 02:37:13.650
I think it was a nerdy thing to be into it cause honestly like oh some kids that

2667
02:37:13.651 --> 02:37:16.940
play dungeons and dragons type and I got involved with them but that's how I

2668
02:37:16.941 --> 02:37:17.511
found money.

2669
02:37:17.511 --> 02:37:20.540
Python was three of them kids cause like there was a thing called the quest for

2670
02:37:20.541 --> 02:37:23.680
the holy grail.
That was like a movie.
It's such a great man.
Oh Man.

2671
02:37:23.700 --> 02:37:27.620
Money rabbits seen right away.
Right away.
Yeah.

2672
02:37:27.760 --> 02:37:29.990
I remember the life of Brian.
We are the knights of them.

2673
02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:36.080
<v 3>Get us a shrubbery
and shrubbery.</v>

2674
02:37:36.500 --> 02:37:40.640
<v 9>Watch it now.
I need to know.
Yeah,
I need to see it.
Yeah,</v>

2675
02:37:40.641 --> 02:37:41.540
those guys are brilliant.

2676
02:37:42.100 --> 02:37:45.950
Life of Brian was Brian one where the hack the guy's arm off.

2677
02:37:46.370 --> 02:37:50.900
That's fucking a quest for the holy grail with the black night.
Come back here.

2678
02:37:50.901 --> 02:37:52.090
I'm bite your balls off.

2679
02:37:58.880 --> 02:38:00.720
Compare the holy hand grenade.

2680
02:38:03.230 --> 02:38:05.600
That's actually hilarious.
Branch dudes in the castle.

2681
02:38:05.660 --> 02:38:09.940
I blow my nose in your general direction.
Castle anthrax.

2682
02:38:10.520 --> 02:38:14.300
It was all the hot naked women in it,
so that's a great movie.

2683
02:38:15.050 --> 02:38:17.070
You gotta just get baked one night and watched.

2684
02:38:18.490 --> 02:38:22.090
<v 3>Okay,
I'll do it.
I will do it.
You'll,
you'll,</v>

2685
02:38:23.910 --> 02:38:27.610
well,
I just watched that.
It was laughing my ass off.
It's almost like now though,

2686
02:38:27.611 --> 02:38:29.740
in 2013 there's too much shit to see.

2687
02:38:29.950 --> 02:38:31.990
Like there's so many documentaries that I have like on my,

2688
02:38:32.050 --> 02:38:35.800
on my cue that I need to watch somebody movies that I haven't seen yet.

2689
02:38:36.600 --> 02:38:38.920
It's almost embarrassing.
He's like,
you can't catch up.

2690
02:38:38.950 --> 02:38:40.450
It's almost like there's too much

2691
02:38:40.650 --> 02:38:44.130
<v 9>to old shit.
I stick to everything I grew up on.
Yeah,
my wife,</v>

2692
02:38:44.370 --> 02:38:47.490
my wife always asks me like,
you've seen this movie like 500 times.

2693
02:38:47.520 --> 02:38:50.010
How could you watch it again?
I'll be like,
cause it's fucking good.

2694
02:38:51.670 --> 02:38:54.840
<v 3>Go over Joey Diaz,
his houses in 90% chance to outlaw Josey Wales.</v>

2695
02:38:54.841 --> 02:38:59.841
We be playing that right as you come at Joe and this is the fucking scene.

2696
02:39:00.430 --> 02:39:04.810
He lays it down.
These are my words of life.
These are my words of life.

2697
02:39:04.820 --> 02:39:08.170
He goes up to the fucking Indian,
he's on a horse.
He's going,
look,
bitch.

2698
02:39:08.290 --> 02:39:12.130
Either we're going to fucking work this out or I'm ready to die.
What's up now?

2699
02:39:12.160 --> 02:39:14.110
It's a great as far as the hill,
he'll just,
he'll be,

2700
02:39:14.111 --> 02:39:17.260
it'll beyond like at any given time when you come over as hotel room,

2701
02:39:17.440 --> 02:39:20.820
if it's on TV,
he's watching it.
Outlaw Josey Wales.

2702
02:39:20.970 --> 02:39:23.290
I have all the people that I've ever seen.
The Ll Josie Wales,

2703
02:39:23.291 --> 02:39:26.560
I bet Joey d hasn't seen it more than anyone.
It's a good movie.

2704
02:39:26.590 --> 02:39:27.460
It's a great fucking movie.

2705
02:39:27.860 --> 02:39:30.070
Certain movies that you could see over and over and over and over again.

2706
02:39:30.760 --> 02:39:31.591
It's good for me.

2707
02:39:31.591 --> 02:39:36.280
It's the mechanic Charles Bronson's mechanic and hard times number.

2708
02:39:36.281 --> 02:39:40.630
Hard Times high times.
Charles Bronson was a cage fighter.
What?
Oh yeah,

2709
02:39:40.810 --> 02:39:41.643
you don't remember.

2710
02:39:42.190 --> 02:39:46.960
He was a 50 year old fit cage fighter and he would go from town to town.

2711
02:39:46.961 --> 02:39:48.460
He had this fucking shady manager.

2712
02:39:48.461 --> 02:39:52.150
He had a cat that he fed milk too and he was this old wirey dude.

2713
02:39:52.151 --> 02:39:53.800
He was 50 years old when they filmed this shit.

2714
02:39:53.950 --> 02:39:58.300
See if you pull up the Sierra Knuckle Charles Bronson from hard times and Yo,

2715
02:39:58.301 --> 02:40:01.540
when he was 50 this mother fucker was chiseled.
Okay.

2716
02:40:01.541 --> 02:40:04.150
This is po before testosterone replacement therapy.

2717
02:40:04.330 --> 02:40:07.000
This was just the way Charles bombed mentality.

2718
02:40:07.030 --> 02:40:10.660
He was just doing chin ups and sit ups and shit and eating red meat,

2719
02:40:10.690 --> 02:40:14.240
drinking milk.
Watch

2720
02:40:14.250 --> 02:40:15.350
<v 9>this video matter way.</v>

2721
02:40:15.360 --> 02:40:19.910
Most people look at like Chuck Norris is how I look at Charles Bronson.
Oh yeah.

2722
02:40:19.950 --> 02:40:23.430
Charles Bronson was one of the baddest dudes ever.
Look at this

2723
02:40:26.070 --> 02:40:29.370
<v 11>old dude and he's just fucking people.
Up to</v>

2724
02:40:33.080 --> 02:40:35.590
1933 America,

2725
02:40:37.030 --> 02:40:38.230
people were out of work.

2726
02:40:41.650 --> 02:40:43.720
Life was as tough as a cheap steak.

2727
02:40:45.090 --> 02:40:48.190
The writing of the times,

2728
02:40:50.140 --> 02:40:53.920
no job and no prospects.
I look past the next event.

2729
02:40:54.520 --> 02:40:57.940
A man had to live by his wits.
Wilma,
man,
just start now.

2730
02:41:00.070 --> 02:41:03.140
He might've been like on motherfucker,
dude.
Wow.

2731
02:41:03.600 --> 02:41:06.050
Look how young all by his fists.

2732
02:41:07.640 --> 02:41:12.640
Columbia pictures.
It's like the original every which way,
but loose real one.

2733
02:41:13.050 --> 02:41:15.240
A drifter I love every which way,
but loose,

2734
02:41:15.680 --> 02:41:18.990
but it can't fuck with hard times and they are fighting fisticuffs style.

2735
02:41:19.390 --> 02:41:21.300
Oh yeah man who spoke so

2736
02:41:22.940 --> 02:41:24.810
you know why and hit hard.

2737
02:41:25.110 --> 02:41:28.440
That's how they used to fight when they rode bare knuckle born con man.

2738
02:41:29.880 --> 02:41:33.090
Well that was at Queens of Mars.
Very shitty.
Right now I'll do it like this.

2739
02:41:33.540 --> 02:41:35.160
Who could make a fortune in a day?

2740
02:41:35.270 --> 02:41:40.270
I propose a toast to the best man I know and lucid.

2741
02:41:41.580 --> 02:41:46.510
I'm flat broke.
I need some money fast.
You don't want no trouble.

2742
02:41:47.430 --> 02:41:50.520
Oh Hey,
your dad's speak.

2743
02:41:50.550 --> 02:41:55.010
Was the hustler easy?
I mean,
no rules about that Deb,

2744
02:41:55.020 --> 02:41:56.970
who when they hit her,

2745
02:41:57.470 --> 02:42:01.580
you ever get scared when you think of,
I'm telling you,

2746
02:42:04.590 --> 02:42:07.730
you can basically do anything.
He just didn't know all that other shit yet.

2747
02:42:08.300 --> 02:42:11.600
They didn't know about leg kicks,
you know?

2748
02:42:11.660 --> 02:42:14.540
No one knew and normally tie back then they did.

2749
02:42:14.541 --> 02:42:17.170
That's because would have bought with,
yeah.

2750
02:42:18.530 --> 02:42:23.350
Oh love that motherfucking kind of a pool table.
Charles Bronson,

2751
02:42:23.890 --> 02:42:27.630
James Colver,
Jill or rather mark fairly.

2752
02:42:29.010 --> 02:42:32.850
That red knock out
terrible,

2753
02:42:32.930 --> 02:42:36.540
<v 9>terrible dies.
None of that stuff about how they win and stuff like that.</v>

2754
02:42:36.541 --> 02:42:39.450
Around back then is,
I love how now like you know your why I like,
you know,

2755
02:42:39.451 --> 02:42:42.780
I watched that show like occasionally on Onstar.
Spartacus,
yes.

2756
02:42:42.810 --> 02:42:45.180
And they'll like have like a hand to hand battle and all of a sudden it's like

2757
02:42:45.360 --> 02:42:49.320
transitions of Jujitsu rolling into armbars in a choke hold.
And it's like,

2758
02:42:49.321 --> 02:42:51.960
what the fuck fuck Outta here man.

2759
02:42:52.050 --> 02:42:56.740
Pankration and they had that sort of,
it wasn't like that back then.
It wasn't,

2760
02:42:56.750 --> 02:42:58.530
part of it's the way it and whatever.

2761
02:42:58.720 --> 02:43:03.700
Then the evolution of Jujitsu has changed so much since,
uh,

2762
02:43:03.930 --> 02:43:06.030
the UFC one since 1993.

2763
02:43:06.290 --> 02:43:09.140
But if you go back to like the old school days with Hixon Gracie,
he,

2764
02:43:09.150 --> 02:43:12.120
they had all the techniques right.
They just,
it wasn't,
the

2765
02:43:12.160 --> 02:43:14.890
<v 5>level wasn't as high as it is today,
you know,
but they're,</v>

2766
02:43:14.900 --> 02:43:18.340
all the techniques were there,
you know,
most of them were triangles,
arm bars,

2767
02:43:18.341 --> 02:43:19.840
all that shit's been around since the 30s.

2768
02:43:20.590 --> 02:43:23.650
But it's just so rare that anybody got like super good at it.

2769
02:43:23.651 --> 02:43:26.500
The way you see like a,
you know,
Marcello Garcia or something like that,

2770
02:43:26.501 --> 02:43:30.130
like the guys that are today or the highest level Jujitsu guys of all time.

2771
02:43:30.280 --> 02:43:33.310
There's still like Hixon.
Gracie is still regarded as the greatest of all time,

2772
02:43:33.490 --> 02:43:36.550
but he was just such a freak.
He was so much better than everybody.

2773
02:43:36.850 --> 02:43:40.210
He was into some weird zone where like you would talk about everybody like,
Oh,

2774
02:43:40.211 --> 02:43:43.480
this guy's real good,
this guy is real good.
And then there's Hixon like in,

2775
02:43:43.481 --> 02:43:47.650
everybody said it,
they all agreed.
There was no debate.
It was no like,
yeah,

2776
02:43:47.651 --> 02:43:51.820
but I think a he Machado is better at bill's,
like takes him,
that's it.

2777
02:43:52.180 --> 02:43:57.070
He's the best one,
dude.
That's forever Shit,
you know?
But from then on,

2778
02:43:57.100 --> 02:44:01.660
you know,
besides him from then on,
basically it's constantly gotten better.

2779
02:44:01.720 --> 02:44:04.500
So that spark is shit that's,
they didn't fight like that.

2780
02:44:05.080 --> 02:44:07.930
They just didn't have enough time and stay alive long enough to learn how to

2781
02:44:07.931 --> 02:44:11.290
fight like that.
And he died when you're 24 and a fucking store in your stomach.

2782
02:44:11.580 --> 02:44:12.101
You know the,

2783
02:44:12.101 --> 02:44:15.370
the idea that you knew how to transition to a triangle and enroll for normal

2784
02:44:15.371 --> 02:44:19.180
Plata and that takes side control.
Full mounds,
arm choke,

2785
02:44:19.420 --> 02:44:22.750
skipped to the side bitch.
You don't know how to do that.
Yeah.
Yeah,
totally.

2786
02:44:22.751 --> 02:44:27.050
Totally.
That didn't happen back then.
But it's funny when they used to like,

2787
02:44:27.160 --> 02:44:30.730
like I wonder like I used to watch deadwood but he used to bum me out when they

2788
02:44:30.731 --> 02:44:33.430
swelled so much cause I'm like I can't believe that they swore that much back

2789
02:44:33.431 --> 02:44:37.750
then cause he didn't swear that much in like the 50s and the 60s like why am I

2790
02:44:37.751 --> 02:44:42.340
supposed to believe this war that much in the 18 hundreds like you sure is that

2791
02:44:42.341 --> 02:44:43.720
real?
I don't know if that's real.

2792
02:44:43.750 --> 02:44:46.260
<v 9>I don't think he was supposed to be proper society either though.</v>

2793
02:44:46.660 --> 02:44:48.030
I'm sure it was a pimp.

2794
02:44:48.070 --> 02:44:52.720
I mean the most like 90% of the squares came out of the fucking pimp guy's
mouth.

2795
02:44:52.870 --> 02:44:56.950
That's true most of the time.
But that guy scores so much was just like,

2796
02:44:57.490 --> 02:45:00.760
he was awesome.
It was amazing.
It was beautiful.
It was a feat of genius.
He,

2797
02:45:00.761 --> 02:45:03.520
I didn't know a human being could swear as much in as,
as,

2798
02:45:03.521 --> 02:45:07.840
as differently as that guy did on that show and have it sound as natural.

2799
02:45:07.900 --> 02:45:11.560
Oh yeah.
He just wore it rolled off his tongue is if that,
there was just a,

2800
02:45:11.750 --> 02:45:12.450
I swear to God,

2801
02:45:12.450 --> 02:45:14.920
the first time I saw an interview with that guy and he'd spoken to English

2802
02:45:14.921 --> 02:45:18.760
fucking accident,
I was just like,
no fucking way.
Fuck Outta here.

2803
02:45:18.790 --> 02:45:22.210
It's hilarious when dudes,
then you hear dudes,
you know,
and they're like English,

2804
02:45:23.860 --> 02:45:27.340
like really?
Like,
oh,
that there's no way that guy's not American.

2805
02:45:27.341 --> 02:45:30.220
You know what I mean?
There are Australian,
you ever hear Jim Jefferies do that?

2806
02:45:30.640 --> 02:45:35.110
Jim Brett,
Jeffery's the comedian,
he's hilarious.
Oh yeah.
He's an Australian guy.

2807
02:45:35.170 --> 02:45:38.000
But he can do the perfect American accent like,
yeah.
Perfect.

2808
02:45:38.001 --> 02:45:41.350
And it's guy freaks you out when you hear him talk and then he goes American on

2809
02:45:41.351 --> 02:45:45.100
you.
Yeah.
All right.
We're almost done here.
So,
uh,
let,
let's end.

2810
02:45:45.120 --> 02:45:48.220
You want to end with one more song?
Oh,

We could do that.

2811
02:45:48.250 --> 02:45:49.110
