1
00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:02.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a,</v>

2
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.330
<v Speaker 1>I think he's too smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>too smart to talk to regular people.</v>

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.130
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Powerful big wave surfer.</v>

4
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.720
<v Speaker 1>How are you buddy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm great.</v>

5
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.940
<v Speaker 1>We just got back from playing little </v>
<v Speaker 1>techno hunt.</v>

6
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.190
<v Speaker 1>We did manage a greatest thing of all </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

7
00:00:16.191 --> 00:00:17.024
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just saying I don't care what the </v>

8
00:00:17.871 --> 00:00:18.840
<v Speaker 1>price is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's worth it.</v>

9
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.800
<v Speaker 1>It's a bargain at twice the price of </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is.</v>

10
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where people don't know what it is.</v>

11
00:00:23.391 --> 00:00:27.050
<v Speaker 1>It's his game that it simulates </v>
<v Speaker 1>bowhunting.</v>

12
00:00:27.051 --> 00:00:27.910
<v Speaker 1>So what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

13
00:00:27.911 --> 00:00:32.380
<v Speaker 1>is a giant screen that's made out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kevlar and then uh,</v>

14
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.540
<v Speaker 1>it's got us like a projector projects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hd images of elk and deer.</v>

15
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.660
<v Speaker 1>You could set it up for a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>different animals,</v>

16
00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.823
<v Speaker 1>but elk and deer walk across the screen </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you shoot at them and it's like the </v>

17
00:00:46.161 --> 00:00:47.060
<v Speaker 1>perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>

18
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.090
<v Speaker 1>we show a little video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shane bannon earlier.</v>

19
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.510
<v Speaker 1>It's really cool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

20
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:51.373
<v Speaker 1>It's a perfect practice for bow hunting </v>
<v Speaker 1>because one of the things about bow </v>

21
00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.480
<v Speaker 1>hunting is you get nervous and the more </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could do something like this,</v>

22
00:00:59.481 --> 00:01:01.460
<v Speaker 1>we just shot a perfect shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The more you could do that.</v>

23
00:01:01.461 --> 00:01:04.870
<v Speaker 1>Over and over and over again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more it becomes ingrained in your,</v>

24
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:06.710
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your nervous system,</v>

25
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.900
<v Speaker 1>ingrained in your muscles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ingrained in your memory,</v>

26
00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.450
<v Speaker 1>and then it becomes natural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

27
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:12.470
<v Speaker 1>it's awesome.</v>

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.190
<v Speaker 2>And when did you start traveling?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Serve?</v>

57
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:17.533
<v Speaker 2>When I was 12,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to England for the world amateur </v>

58
00:02:20.571 --> 00:02:21.404

63
00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.003
<v Speaker 2>I been putting my surfboards in a board </v>
<v Speaker 2>bag and walking out the door with my </v>

64
00:02:37.491 --> 00:02:38.324
<v Speaker 2>passport since I was 12 and going to so </v>
<v Speaker 2>many different destinations around the </v>

65
00:02:42.561 --> 00:02:43.394
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>literally just for surfing wire nuts </v>

66
00:02:45.181 --> 00:02:46.810
<v Speaker 2>does such a crazy way to grow up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

67
00:02:46.811 --> 00:02:47.644
<v Speaker 2>That's a cool thing about the film is </v>
<v Speaker 2>all of us have that in common and it's </v>

68
00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.153
<v Speaker 2>crazy the way the story set up too </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's so many things in it </v>

69
00:02:55.101 --> 00:02:57.170
<v Speaker 2>that I didn't really realize were </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening at the time.</v>

70
00:02:57.171 --> 00:02:58.970
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I came from,</v>

71
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.490
<v Speaker 3>I came from a broken family,</v>
<v Speaker 3>alcoholic father,</v>

72
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:04.653
<v Speaker 3>kind of radical situation at home and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then like a lot of us had like broken </v>

73
00:03:08.081 --> 00:03:08.914
<v Speaker 3>families,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of us had that in common so we </v>

74
00:03:11.861 --> 00:03:15.880
<v Speaker 3>sort of have like this weird fucked up </v>
<v Speaker 3>family dynamic in common.</v>

75
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.360
<v Speaker 3>So we all became sort of like our own </v>
<v Speaker 3>family on the road.</v>

76
00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.560
<v Speaker 3>So we were competing for a world title.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're all competing and going around the</v>

77
00:03:23.561 --> 00:03:25.180
<v Speaker 3>world all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>staying together.</v>

78
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:26.463
<v Speaker 3>So we became best friends like this </v>
<v Speaker 3>nucleus of surfers and we all just </v>

79
00:03:29.411 --> 00:03:30.244
<v Speaker 3>became ultra close and then when things </v>
<v Speaker 3>get really serious with a surfing </v>

80
00:03:34.181 --> 00:03:35.014
<v Speaker 3>competition and there was a lot on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>line with sponsors and money and big </v>

81
00:03:37.271 --> 00:03:39.910
<v Speaker 3>brands coming in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The shit hit the fan.</v>

82
00:03:39.911 --> 00:03:43.000
<v Speaker 3>And then we started like breaking up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It got two series.</v>

83
00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.983
<v Speaker 3>It was almost like a band who just </v>
<v Speaker 3>couldn't stand each other anymore or </v>

84
00:03:46.631 --> 00:03:48.240
<v Speaker 3>things got too radical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

85
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.960
<v Speaker 3>girls got in the way or money got in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

86
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.080
<v Speaker 3>And so there was like this kinda like </v>
<v Speaker 3>breaking up element,</v>

87
00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:54.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>throughout our group.</v>

88
00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.983
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine when you're living like </v>

89
00:03:58.511 --> 00:04:01.120
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those people must be so valuable for you</v>

90
00:04:01.121 --> 00:04:01.954

<v Speaker 3>People that can understand your way of </v>

91
00:04:04.151 --> 00:04:04.984
<v Speaker 3>life because it's their way of life too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because like to to a regular person who </v>

92
00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.940
<v Speaker 3>commutes every day and goes to an office</v>
<v Speaker 3>comes home like your life is alien.</v>

94
00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.963
<v Speaker 3>I still get like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I still get uncomfortable when people </v>

95
00:04:18.281 --> 00:04:20.840
<v Speaker 3>asked me what I do for a living,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:17.530
<v Speaker 3>riding the waves of the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a house wife.</v>

119
00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:19.510
<v Speaker 3>Wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

120
00:05:19.511 --> 00:05:22.210
<v Speaker 3>I went to accounting school and I and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't have,</v>

121
00:05:22.211 --> 00:05:23.890
<v Speaker 3>there's not like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing.</v>

122
00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:24.723
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's not like another category I can </v>

123
00:05:26.951 --> 00:05:27.701
<v Speaker 3>really point to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

124
00:05:27.701 --> 00:05:29.710
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to make the point go quicker to.</v>

125
00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.113
<v Speaker 3>There's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

126
00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:33.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like there's basketball players and</v>

127
00:05:33.791 --> 00:05:34.624
<v Speaker 3>football players and all of them were </v>
<v Speaker 3>like scoring goals and getting these </v>

128
00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.000
<v Speaker 3>brand endorsements from that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from competition element.</v>

129
00:05:40.001 --> 00:05:44.110
<v Speaker 3>So because I'm a free surfer who doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>compete at all,</v>

130
00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:45.910
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to wrap your head around,</v>

131
00:05:45.911 --> 00:05:47.170
<v Speaker 3>but they've been harder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

132
00:05:47.171 --> 00:05:47.951
<v Speaker 3>Basically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

133
00:05:47.951 --> 00:05:48.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

134
00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:49.091
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

135
00:05:49.091 --> 00:05:50.940
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

136
00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:52.703
<v Speaker 3>I have a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a large surfing profile and so like I </v>

137
00:05:54.701 --> 00:05:56.530
<v Speaker 3>work with a lot of brands and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>just the kind of,</v>

138
00:05:56.531 --> 00:05:58.160
<v Speaker 3>the way it works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just sponsors.</v>

139
00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:59.013
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

140
00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.220
<v Speaker 3>Now this movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this documentary,</v>

141
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:03.440
<v Speaker 3>did they have footage of you guys from </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you were really young?</v>

142
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:05.180
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

143
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.490
<v Speaker 3>they do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that weird watching that stuff?</v>

144
00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:08.713
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very weird because we're all in our </v>

145
00:06:10.101 --> 00:06:13.070
<v Speaker 3>forties now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We all got kids and for most of us,</v>

146
00:06:13.071 --> 00:06:15.510
<v Speaker 3>except for Kelly Kelly still going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you 40,</v>

147
00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.110
<v Speaker 3>46 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

148
00:06:17.111 --> 00:06:17.944
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw him on your show the other day is </v>

149
00:06:18.831 --> 00:06:20.480
<v Speaker 3>pretty classic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but so,</v>

150
00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:22.940
<v Speaker 3>so he's like a focal point in the film.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

151
00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:25.570
<v Speaker 3>he's part of the momentum generation and</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

152
00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:26.703
<v Speaker 3>and so he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is incredible footage of him when </v>

153
00:06:28.371 --> 00:06:31.610
<v Speaker 3>he's nine years old or 10 years old and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's in Florida,</v>

154
00:06:31.611 --> 00:06:35.660
<v Speaker 3>like a little rat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a little sunburn rat and it's neat.</v>

155
00:06:35.661 --> 00:06:37.190
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we all had that in common.</v>

156
00:06:37.191 --> 00:06:38.630
<v Speaker 3>That's we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we all grew up in,</v>

157
00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.170
<v Speaker 3>in different places and then we all fell</v>
<v Speaker 3>in love with surfing,</v>

158
00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:43.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>separately,</v>

159
00:06:43.491 --> 00:06:46.100
<v Speaker 3>and then we all just became super tight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>

160
00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:47.170
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was great.</v>

161
00:06:47.171 --> 00:06:48.050
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's great.</v>

162
00:06:48.051 --> 00:06:50.390
<v Speaker 3>And then now we're all like best friends</v>
<v Speaker 3>again because there's no,</v>

163
00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:54.050
<v Speaker 3>there's no points on a line or a world </v>
<v Speaker 3>title on the line or like brands getting</v>

164
00:06:54.051 --> 00:06:55.670
<v Speaker 3>in the way or girls getting in the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're all,</v>

165
00:06:55.671 --> 00:06:56.760
<v Speaker 3>we're all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

166
00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:58.473
<v Speaker 3>we're finally growing up that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that had to be strange though to </v>

167
00:07:03.081 --> 00:07:08.081
<v Speaker 3>be so tight and then everything sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>get bottlenecked by the pressure.</v>

168
00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:09.643
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

169
00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:12.340
<v Speaker 3>Anything serving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much pressure could there be?</v>

170
00:07:12.341 --> 00:07:13.930
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're all trying to make a living,</v>

171
00:07:13.931 --> 00:07:14.441
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

172
00:07:14.441 --> 00:07:15.430
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

173
00:07:15.431 --> 00:07:16.264
<v Speaker 3>that was our dream to surf as much as </v>
<v Speaker 3>possible and see the world and that's </v>

174
00:07:18.851 --> 00:07:21.970
<v Speaker 3>the only way you could do it for us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whenever there's competition,</v>

175
00:07:21.971 --> 00:07:24.010
<v Speaker 3>there's got to be massive amounts of </v>
<v Speaker 3>pressure.</v>

176
00:07:24.011 --> 00:07:24.844
<v Speaker 3>Whenever there's someone trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>achieve something or someone trying to </v>

177
00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:31.270
<v Speaker 3>rise to the top of a profession and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're surrounded by a bunch,</v>

178
00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:32.143
<v Speaker 3>but you also must have pushed each other</v>
<v Speaker 3>to and it must have been beneficial to </v>

179
00:07:35.141 --> 00:07:40.141
<v Speaker 3>have people like you around as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's part of,</v>

180
00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:43.671
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

181
00:07:43.671 --> 00:07:46.620
<v Speaker 3>I think it's like part of our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our human DNA to,</v>

182
00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:48.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be naturally competitive.</v>

183
00:07:48.171 --> 00:07:49.004
<v Speaker 3>So I think especially men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that we feel like we have </v>

184
00:07:50.661 --> 00:07:52.300
<v Speaker 3>something to prove,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

185
00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:54.550
<v Speaker 3>like where we stand compared to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>other guys were,</v>

186
00:07:54.551 --> 00:07:56.630
<v Speaker 3>whether it was like in the cave man days</v>
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>

187
00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:57.800
<v Speaker 3>or like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

188
00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:58.873
<v Speaker 3>the first hunters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas it was like for sure they were </v>

189
00:08:00.441 --> 00:08:01.274
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were competitive too so you could </v>

190
00:08:01.911 --> 00:08:04.460
<v Speaker 3>bring home meat for the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the tribe.</v>

191
00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:07.550
<v Speaker 3>And then it just kept going from there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

192
00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:07.961
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

193
00:08:07.961 --> 00:08:08.860
<v Speaker 3>and now we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

194
00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:11.260
<v Speaker 3>we compete with whatever we're into and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

195
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:12.103
<v Speaker 3>for us with surfing we came hyper </v>
<v Speaker 3>competitive and especially me like from </v>

196
00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:19.040
<v Speaker 3>the time I was like maybe 16 or 17 total</v>
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>

197
00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:19.883
<v Speaker 3>I was like my mid twenties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like super competitive where I </v>

198
00:08:21.771 --> 00:08:26.390
<v Speaker 3>want to rip people's heads off my heat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I would like visualize horrible,</v>

199
00:08:26.391 --> 00:08:31.391
<v Speaker 3>horrible things happening to them while </v>
<v Speaker 3>I was competing against them and it's so</v>

200
00:08:32.121 --> 00:08:35.660
<v Speaker 3>crazy how that's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One hundred percent gone from my.</v>

201
00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:37.590
<v Speaker 3>My being now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't even imagine doing that.</v>

202
00:08:37.591 --> 00:08:40.610
<v Speaker 3>I'm like the most relaxed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>non competitive person.</v>

203
00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:42.830
<v Speaker 3>I have no competitiveness left in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>body.</v>

204
00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:44.150
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've only known you for what,</v>

205
00:08:44.151 --> 00:08:48.270
<v Speaker 3>four years or something like that in </v>
<v Speaker 3>those years I could not imagine you have</v>

206
00:08:48.271 --> 00:08:51.620
<v Speaker 3>an evil thoughts towards someone who </v>
<v Speaker 3>seem so chill.</v>

207
00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:54.090
<v Speaker 3>I was a shit talker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or are you really?</v>

208
00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:55.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

209
00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:56.170
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

210
00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:59.900
<v Speaker 2>I remember I was surfing as this Guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>Damien hardman and,</v>

211
00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:01.550
<v Speaker 2>and he was like an Australian world </v>
<v Speaker 2>champion.</v>

212
00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:02.423
<v Speaker 2>He was like an older generation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were from the young new school </v>

213
00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:05.453
<v Speaker 2>generation were coming up and there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>these established guys who didn't want </v>

214
00:09:08.131 --> 00:09:08.731
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

215
00:09:08.731 --> 00:09:11.070
<v Speaker 2>like bd thrown in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was this Guy Damien hardman who is</v>

216
00:09:11.071 --> 00:09:11.904
<v Speaker 2>a bad ass competitive surfer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was a very like tactician </v>

217
00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:18.660
<v Speaker 2>conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd never fall.</v>

218
00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.670
<v Speaker 2>He seemed like a nerd in me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

219
00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:21.683
<v Speaker 2>I was like raw kid from Hawaii and this </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy was like so presentable and </v>

220
00:09:24.571 --> 00:09:25.404
<v Speaker 2>professional and I just presented it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in a heat with him and he got </v>

221
00:09:29.071 --> 00:09:29.904
<v Speaker 2>priority,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means that he had first right of </v>

222
00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:37.100
<v Speaker 2>wave and I just needed a tiny little </v>
<v Speaker 2>score to win and he basically sat on me,</v>

223
00:09:37.381 --> 00:09:38.214
<v Speaker 2>which means he uses it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He used his priority to chase me around </v>

224
00:09:41.941 --> 00:09:45.600
<v Speaker 2>the lineup and sit on me and keep me </v>
<v Speaker 2>from cutting a wave and let the time run</v>

225
00:09:45.601 --> 00:09:45.960
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

226
00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.690
<v Speaker 2>And the whole time I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you surf like a girl?</v>

227
00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:49.843
<v Speaker 2>He served for like a little bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I was like totally shit talking to </v>

228
00:09:52.471 --> 00:09:54.690
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And did it work?</v>

229
00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:58.410
<v Speaker 2>Did he get you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got me because he wrote the I,</v>

230
00:09:58.650 --> 00:09:59.483
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

231
00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:03.120
<v Speaker 2>I basically cracked and started like </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting emotional and he loved it.</v>

232
00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:04.890
<v Speaker 2>He went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got this guy beat.</v>

233
00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:06.900
<v Speaker 2>He started to shit talk me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He loved that.</v>

234
00:10:06.901 --> 00:10:07.820
<v Speaker 2>I any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any,</v>

235
00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:08.673
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he actually came up to me later and he </v>

236
00:10:09.091 --> 00:10:11.310
<v Speaker 2>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love it that you're that passionate.</v>

237
00:10:11.311 --> 00:10:12.144
<v Speaker 2>I love it that you got that site.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that emotional where you just </v>

238
00:10:13.861 --> 00:10:15.450
<v Speaker 2>started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like trying to like insult me.</v>

239
00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:16.523
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's my goal when I'm in heats with </v>

240
00:10:18.151 --> 00:10:20.800
<v Speaker 2>people is to get them to that point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

241
00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:22.650
<v Speaker 2>It must like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's good.</v>

242
00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:24.720
<v Speaker 2>There's got to be a lot of parallels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fight world,</v>

243
00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:26.280
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

244
00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:27.263
<v Speaker 4>Well it's also when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you can get someone emotional than </v>

245
00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:35.670
<v Speaker 4>fighting in particular is so dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so when you lose,</v>

246
00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:38.730
<v Speaker 4>you're not just losing like someone's </v>
<v Speaker 4>taking a piece of you,</v>

247
00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:41.160
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because they're fucking you up.</v>

248
00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:43.710
<v Speaker 4>They're not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not just beating you on points.</v>

249
00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:45.990
<v Speaker 4>I mean there are beating on point </v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes,</v>

250
00:10:45.991 --> 00:10:48.760
<v Speaker 4>but they're punching you in the face to </v>
<v Speaker 4>beat you on those points here,</v>

251
00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:51.360
<v Speaker 4>the kicking you in the body,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're fucking your legs up.</v>

252
00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:52.223
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's something about that that's so </v>

253
00:10:53.761 --> 00:10:57.120
<v Speaker 4>intensely emotional.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when you're fighting,</v>

254
00:10:57.390 --> 00:10:58.223
<v Speaker 4>you're fighting at your best.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to be in this sort of flow </v>

255
00:11:00.661 --> 00:11:02.160
<v Speaker 4>state,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this sort of Zen,</v>

256
00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:05.880
<v Speaker 4>not thinking about anything but what's </v>
<v Speaker 4>happening and reacting and just going on</v>

257
00:11:05.881 --> 00:11:10.020
<v Speaker 4>your training and your instincts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you can get a guy to be angry and</v>

258
00:11:10.021 --> 00:11:10.854
<v Speaker 4>emotional,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it will severely impair for most </v>

259
00:11:14.011 --> 00:11:16.920
<v Speaker 4>fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>severely impair your ability to perform.</v>

260
00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:19.980
<v Speaker 4>Most fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they lose to get tense.</v>

261
00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:21.113
<v Speaker 4>They tighten up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they look to wind up instead of just </v>

262
00:11:22.651 --> 00:11:23.484
<v Speaker 4>letting things flow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're talking about this guy style </v>

263
00:11:25.381 --> 00:11:29.760
<v Speaker 4>bender who fought this weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That guy follows like when you watch him</v>

264
00:11:29.761 --> 00:11:31.530
<v Speaker 4>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he just flows.</v>

265
00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:34.050
<v Speaker 4>I mean he walks into the octagon </v>
<v Speaker 4>dancing.</v>

266
00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:35.273
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean like full on dancing like pop in </v>

267
00:11:37.381 --> 00:11:39.480
<v Speaker 4>and moving and has that mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's just,</v>

268
00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:41.700
<v Speaker 4>he just gets loose and when he gets in </v>
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>

269
00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:44.420
<v Speaker 4>he's switching stances and he's what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

270
00:11:44.421 --> 00:11:45.254
<v Speaker 4>There was a mad shit talking session </v>
<v Speaker 4>between these two guys for the last six </v>

271
00:11:48.991 --> 00:11:49.824
<v Speaker 4>weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he stayed calm through the whole </v>

272
00:11:51.451 --> 00:11:54.190
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you could when the two</v>

273
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:56.890
<v Speaker 3>gun into the octagon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Derek Brunson just couldn't wait to just</v>

274
00:11:56.891 --> 00:12:01.180
<v Speaker 3>grab a hold of them and style bender </v>
<v Speaker 3>just avoided all that shit.</v>

275
00:12:01.181 --> 00:12:03.010
<v Speaker 3>And one of Kale and I'm in the first </v>
<v Speaker 3>round.</v>

276
00:12:03.011 --> 00:12:07.140
<v Speaker 3>But the emotional aspect of the shit </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking and the,</v>

277
00:12:07.141 --> 00:12:07.974
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the tension that it brings because it </v>

278
00:12:09.371 --> 00:12:11.800
<v Speaker 3>tightens guys up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we were talking about bow hunting.</v>

279
00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:15.880
<v Speaker 3>Like you see a big elk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have one shot at a big elk,</v>

280
00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:18.520
<v Speaker 3>one shot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you draw back your bow and you're like,</v>

281
00:12:18.521 --> 00:12:19.354
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's literally a life or death </v>

282
00:12:21.491 --> 00:12:23.440
<v Speaker 3>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's all this tension.</v>

283
00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:26.440
<v Speaker 3>And if you could alleviate that tension,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that pressure,</v>

284
00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:27.880
<v Speaker 3>you will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would perform better.</v>

285
00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:29.650
<v Speaker 3>The mindset is everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's everything.</v>

286
00:12:29.651 --> 00:12:30.910
<v Speaker 3>It's everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's everything.</v>

287
00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:34.600
<v Speaker 3>It's everything with golf,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's everything with pool.</v>

288
00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:37.300
<v Speaker 3>It's everything with any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anytime there's something on the line.</v>

289
00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:38.283
<v Speaker 3>But what's fascinating is like for you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you've watched thousands of fights </v>

290
00:12:41.621 --> 00:12:42.610
<v Speaker 3>like ringside,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

291
00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:43.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

292
00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:45.760
<v Speaker 3>So like you must be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

293
00:12:45.761 --> 00:12:47.890
<v Speaker 3>we're in the second round and this guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

294
00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:49.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these two guys are like up and up.</v>

295
00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:50.561
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

296
00:12:50.561 --> 00:12:51.394
<v Speaker 3>it's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a super tight fight and you </v>

297
00:12:52.261 --> 00:12:56.350
<v Speaker 3>guys have a good fight and there must be</v>
<v Speaker 3>an inflection points where you instantly</v>

298
00:12:56.351 --> 00:13:00.100
<v Speaker 3>know that one guy is going to lose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like something happens with their psyche</v>

299
00:13:00.101 --> 00:13:02.380
<v Speaker 3>or something happens out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can see in their eyes,</v>

300
00:13:02.381 --> 00:13:04.930
<v Speaker 3>you can see it in their body language.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of a sudden they lose that,</v>

301
00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:06.400
<v Speaker 3>that edge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that mindset,</v>

302
00:13:06.401 --> 00:13:07.234
<v Speaker 3>and they are basically have already lost</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though it's like right in the </v>

303
00:13:09.551 --> 00:13:12.620
<v Speaker 3>middle of the round.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then you see one guy that's like the.</v>

304
00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:15.550
<v Speaker 3>One of the crazy things about fighting </v>
<v Speaker 3>is it's so unpredictable.</v>

305
00:13:15.551 --> 00:13:17.170
<v Speaker 3>Even when you think God is going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>lose,</v>

306
00:13:17.171 --> 00:13:19.150
<v Speaker 3>sometimes they come back and win by </v>
<v Speaker 3>knockout,</v>

307
00:13:19.151 --> 00:13:20.050
<v Speaker 3>like out of nowhere.</v>

308
00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:22.900
<v Speaker 3>I just had a fight sport.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who are those?</v>

309
00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:24.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guy with an awesome instagram.</v>

310
00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:26.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Black Dude.</v>

311
00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:27.940
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was losing that fight.</v>

312
00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.220
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a fight nerd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

313
00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:31.870
<v Speaker 3>he was getting fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was Lou.</v>

314
00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:32.461
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

315
00:13:32.461 --> 00:13:35.180
<v Speaker 3>the guy's losing the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's zero chance to win next year.</v>

316
00:13:35.181 --> 00:13:35.790
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

317
00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:37.330
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was so exciting.</v>

318
00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:38.303
<v Speaker 3>Volkov,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guy he beat had just beaten for </v>

319
00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:42.030
<v Speaker 3>overdoing who's a former heavyweight </v>
<v Speaker 3>champion.</v>

320
00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:43.900
<v Speaker 3>Beat him by knockout.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

321
00:13:43.901 --> 00:13:45.970
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alexander's the real deal.</v>

322
00:13:45.971 --> 00:13:46.510
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a.</v>

323
00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:49.660
<v Speaker 3>He was what I thought was the dark horse</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the heavyweight division,</v>

324
00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:50.853
<v Speaker 3>but he stood in front of Derek for too </v>
<v Speaker 3>long and derrick hit him with a fucking </v>

325
00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:54.903
<v Speaker 3>bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had heard them earlier too because </v>

326
00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:57.423
<v Speaker 3>derrick derrick hit him and knocked his </v>
<v Speaker 3>mouthpiece out and he didn't know his </v>

327
00:14:00.401 --> 00:14:01.234
<v Speaker 3>mouthpiece was gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The referee was trying to get into the </v>

328
00:14:02.771 --> 00:14:03.570
<v Speaker 3>Nazis.</v>

329
00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:04.001
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

330
00:14:04.001 --> 00:14:05.650
<v Speaker 3>that's not my mouthpiece.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's his mouthpiece,</v>

331
00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:06.880
<v Speaker 3>and the referee was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>motherfucker,</v>

332
00:14:06.881 --> 00:14:09.040
<v Speaker 3>you don't have a mouthpiece.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm holding your mouthpiece,</v>

333
00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:10.870
<v Speaker 3>your mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's in the zone.</v>

334
00:14:10.871 --> 00:14:12.310
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he was in the zone.</v>

335
00:14:12.311 --> 00:14:13.144
<v Speaker 3>I think he was in space.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's that mindset of either had been </v>

336
00:14:17.291 --> 00:14:22.030
<v Speaker 3>clipped,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but fighting like the nature of fighting</v>

337
00:14:22.031 --> 00:14:24.670
<v Speaker 3>is built for competition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's perfectly suited to competition.</v>

338
00:14:24.671 --> 00:14:28.630
<v Speaker 3>Surfing's not right surfing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think surfing is like the least suited</v>

339
00:14:28.631 --> 00:14:29.464
<v Speaker 3>for competition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't see surfing as a sport </v>

340
00:14:30.551 --> 00:14:32.740
<v Speaker 3>whatsoever because when you're on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>wave,</v>

341
00:14:32.741 --> 00:14:33.574
<v Speaker 3>you have to be zen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to go with the flow of the </v>

342
00:14:35.771 --> 00:14:36.604
<v Speaker 3>wave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not really competing against </v>

343
00:14:37.271 --> 00:14:39.190
<v Speaker 3>another person per se,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though you are.</v>

344
00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:42.040
<v Speaker 3>You're really riding the wave and you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>being judged.</v>

345
00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:44.470
<v Speaker 3>Which is weird because it's artists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I humans.</v>

346
00:14:44.471 --> 00:14:46.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think the,</v>

347
00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:47.173
<v Speaker 3>I think the single most important aspect</v>
<v Speaker 3>of surfing that makes it not good for </v>

348
00:14:51.711 --> 00:14:54.020
<v Speaker 3>competition is you're dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 3>mother nature.</v>

349
00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:56.070
<v Speaker 3>It's completely unfair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

350
00:14:56.071 --> 00:14:56.840
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

351
00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:58.490
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might get an awesome wave.</v>

352
00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:00.470
<v Speaker 3>The next guy might get a shitty one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

353
00:15:00.471 --> 00:15:01.304
<v Speaker 3>Some kid who on a scale of one to 10,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their ability levels like a three can </v>

354
00:15:05.391 --> 00:15:10.391
<v Speaker 3>beat the Kelly slater in a heat easily </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it is just like if that kid gets</v>

355
00:15:11.451 --> 00:15:13.730
<v Speaker 3>the best waves in the heat and Kelly </v>
<v Speaker 3>accidentally falls,</v>

356
00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:15.050
<v Speaker 3>he loses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

357
00:15:15.051 --> 00:15:17.300
<v Speaker 3>like that's just the way it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where like if I was playing,</v>

358
00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:21.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lebron James a thousand games in a row,</v>

359
00:15:21.591 --> 00:15:23.480
<v Speaker 3>I'm never going to win.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Never gonna win.</v>

360
00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:25.240
<v Speaker 3>It's impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

361
00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:27.380
<v Speaker 3>but I mean surf competitions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cool that I,</v>

362
00:15:27.381 --> 00:15:28.214
<v Speaker 3>I've surfing it just as a lifestyle as </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a way to stay sane and have peace </v>

363
00:15:33.291 --> 00:15:36.260
<v Speaker 3>in your life and meet friends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what surfing is about.</v>

364
00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:38.000
<v Speaker 3>Servings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking awesome for that.</v>

365
00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:40.640
<v Speaker 3>Do you think you appreciate it more now </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're not competing?</v>

366
00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:43.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do because I don't see it as,</v>

367
00:15:43.641 --> 00:15:44.474
<v Speaker 3>it's my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>My,</v>

368
00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:45.433
<v Speaker 3>my surfing to me is tied to like only </v>
<v Speaker 3>happiness and only like surfing with my </v>

369
00:15:51.471 --> 00:15:55.400
<v Speaker 3>son and his friends and surfing with my </v>
<v Speaker 3>daughter and going to the beach and,</v>

370
00:15:55.401 --> 00:15:56.234
<v Speaker 3>and traveling to get epic waves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not about like pressure and points </v>

371
00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:01.393
<v Speaker 3>and a world title and sponsors putting </v>
<v Speaker 3>pressure on me and my me putting </v>

372
00:16:04.941 --> 00:16:06.780
<v Speaker 3>pressure on myself that basically like </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

373
00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:07.550
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

374
00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:10.760
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pressure part of surfing has gone,</v>

375
00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:13.400
<v Speaker 3>which is amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

376
00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:14.443
<v Speaker 3>I still put the pressure on myself to </v>
<v Speaker 3>serve at a high level and perform at a </v>

377
00:16:17.421 --> 00:16:19.410
<v Speaker 3>high level to myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

378
00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:21.120
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

379
00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:22.420
<v Speaker 3>and be able to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

380
00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:25.130
<v Speaker 3>have having a game still for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love that.</v>

381
00:16:25.131 --> 00:16:25.964
<v Speaker 3>I love the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love the performance aspect of </v>

382
00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:28.873
<v Speaker 3>surfing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the actual competition part is gone </v>

383
00:16:31.491 --> 00:16:32.270
<v Speaker 3>for me.</v>

384
00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:33.103
<v Speaker 3>It's so cool though that you kept the </v>
<v Speaker 3>love of it after the competition was </v>

385
00:16:36.231 --> 00:16:39.260
<v Speaker 3>gone because one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>happens to some,</v>

386
00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:43.130
<v Speaker 3>what definitely happens to fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they retire and they get fat.</v>

387
00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:46.990
<v Speaker 3>They don't want to work out anymore </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the working out was so torturous</v>

388
00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:50.150
<v Speaker 3>and it felt so much like work that after</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's over,</v>

389
00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:51.163
<v Speaker 3>whatever love they had for martial arts </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of goes out the window and they </v>

390
00:16:53.331 --> 00:16:55.570
<v Speaker 3>start putting on weight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't want to.</v>

391
00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:56.443
<v Speaker 3>They don't want to train anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you even after the competition was </v>

392
00:16:59.181 --> 00:17:01.070
<v Speaker 3>over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you kept the love.</v>

393
00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:03.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just.</v>

394
00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:04.573
<v Speaker 3>Surfing is this unique thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how you can fall out of </v>

395
00:17:06.441 --> 00:17:07.520
<v Speaker 3>love with surfing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Surfing,</v>

396
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:08.670
<v Speaker 3>surfing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>

397
00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:09.503
<v Speaker 3>When I'm in the front of the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I stood on a surfboard and rubbed my </v>

398
00:17:11.241 --> 00:17:12.560
<v Speaker 3>first wave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew that was out.</v>

399
00:17:12.561 --> 00:17:14.240
<v Speaker 3>That was who I was in my DNA.</v>

400
00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:16.550
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like pure and simple.</v>

401
00:17:16.551 --> 00:17:17.630
<v Speaker 3>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is why.</v>

402
00:17:17.631 --> 00:17:19.640
<v Speaker 3>This is who I am.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First wave,</v>

403
00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:22.040
<v Speaker 3>my yoga teachers become obsessed with </v>
<v Speaker 3>DNA,</v>

404
00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:22.933
<v Speaker 3>with the DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My Yoga teacher's been become obsessed </v>

405
00:17:24.831 --> 00:17:28.400
<v Speaker 3>with surfing all over instagram now is </v>
<v Speaker 3>just surfing.</v>

406
00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:29.263
<v Speaker 3>She just surfs everyday and it's so </v>
<v Speaker 3>weird not to nowhere and like 35 years </v>

407
00:17:31.911 --> 00:17:35.240
<v Speaker 3>old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She found surfing surfing's weird thing,</v>

408
00:17:35.241 --> 00:17:37.850
<v Speaker 3>but it takes takes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

409
00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:40.310
<v Speaker 3>it's A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's not very many things that are,</v>

410
00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:43.520
<v Speaker 3>that are really similar to surfing in </v>
<v Speaker 3>that way where you can fall in love with</v>

411
00:17:43.521 --> 00:17:46.130
<v Speaker 3>it being five years old or 80 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

412
00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:49.890
<v Speaker 3>I would think being a yoga teacher too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's got incredible balance,</v>

413
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:50.843
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like having balanced probably really </v>

414
00:17:53.041 --> 00:17:55.260
<v Speaker 2>help your ability to pick that up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

415
00:17:55.261 --> 00:17:58.050
<v Speaker 2>what's cool about surfing is it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it's a,</v>

416
00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:00.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if I,</v>

417
00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:01.853
<v Speaker 2>if I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

418
00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:02.693
<v Speaker 2>let's see if I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I take 100 people and said all you </v>

419
00:18:06.631 --> 00:18:10.380
<v Speaker 2>guys are gonna learn how to drive a race</v>
<v Speaker 2>car and you had like a six week course,</v>

420
00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:11.393
<v Speaker 2>just pure race car driving hundred.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The 100 of those people are going to </v>

421
00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:15.143
<v Speaker 2>become really good at driving cars and </v>
<v Speaker 2>going super fast and racing and they'll </v>

422
00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:21.090
<v Speaker 2>how this really accelerated learning </v>
<v Speaker 2>curve and get pretty damn good at it.</v>

423
00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:23.160
<v Speaker 2>Snowboarding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yoga,</v>

424
00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:25.740
<v Speaker 2>like almost anything surfing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>

425
00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:30.150
<v Speaker 2>I know people who have been serving for </v>
<v Speaker 2>three decades and they suck.</v>

426
00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:34.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm serious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>

427
00:18:34.951 --> 00:18:37.640
<v Speaker 2>They've never gotten a tube like in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>two.</v>

428
00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:39.490
<v Speaker 2>That's like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like the Holy Grail of surfing,</v>

429
00:18:39.491 --> 00:18:44.491
<v Speaker 2>like writing inside the waves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like right in the center of it surfing's</v>

430
00:18:45.181 --> 00:18:46.140
<v Speaker 2>fricking hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

431
00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:47.760
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has.</v>

432
00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:48.770
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

433
00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:50.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

434
00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:51.953
<v Speaker 2>it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't mean you have to be good </v>

435
00:18:53.251 --> 00:18:55.140
<v Speaker 2>to enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Surfing's awesome.</v>

436
00:18:55.141 --> 00:18:57.180
<v Speaker 2>No matter what level you're at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the beauty of surfing.</v>

437
00:18:57.181 --> 00:18:59.630
<v Speaker 2>But surfing is hard to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

438
00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:00.473
<v Speaker 2>It's really hard to get good at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's why you get people with </v>

439
00:19:01.911 --> 00:19:02.940
<v Speaker 2>surfing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

440
00:19:02.941 --> 00:19:03.774
<v Speaker 2>five years and they're pretty good and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's people who sort of 50 years and </v>

441
00:19:05.581 --> 00:19:07.650
<v Speaker 2>they've never been good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what is,</v>

442
00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:10.080
<v Speaker 2>what is it is a balance issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it,</v>

443
00:19:10.081 --> 00:19:12.810
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ability to adjust your,</v>

444
00:19:12.811 --> 00:19:15.660
<v Speaker 2>your ability to correct while things are</v>
<v Speaker 2>happening.</v>

445
00:19:15.661 --> 00:19:19.430
<v Speaker 2>Like what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of is body awareness and,</v>

446
00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:20.543
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and is adapting to something that's </v>

447
00:19:21.751 --> 00:19:22.590
<v Speaker 2>changing all the time.</v>

448
00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:24.420
<v Speaker 2>Like say it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

449
00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:28.230
<v Speaker 2>say for instance like basketball did </v>
<v Speaker 2>know the hoops,</v>

450
00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:31.310
<v Speaker 2>they're the basketballs in your hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the elements never changed.</v>

451
00:19:31.450 --> 00:19:35.150
<v Speaker 2>There's no variables really besides some</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude tried to block it or,</v>

452
00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:36.750
<v Speaker 2>or golf.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got the club,</v>

453
00:19:36.751 --> 00:19:37.800
<v Speaker 2>you got the ball,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got the whole,</v>

454
00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:40.800
<v Speaker 2>but with with surfing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got your board and you got you,</v>

455
00:19:40.801 --> 00:19:44.030
<v Speaker 2>but that waves never the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's literally never want to waves,</v>

456
00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:48.270
<v Speaker 2>not the same to any others in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so every single time you're adapting</v>

457
00:19:48.271 --> 00:19:50.460
<v Speaker 2>to things that are changing in the real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in real time,</v>

458
00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:51.563
<v Speaker 2>like up to the millisecond,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the waves changing shape as you're </v>

459
00:19:54.241 --> 00:19:55.074
<v Speaker 2>writing insecure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're never like reacting to </v>

460
00:19:57.121 --> 00:19:57.954
<v Speaker 2>something that is going to stay put.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like anticipating the wave </v>

461
00:20:01.891 --> 00:20:04.080
<v Speaker 2>changing shape and that's what you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to like.</v>

462
00:20:04.081 --> 00:20:04.914
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do a bottom turn into a big</v>
<v Speaker 2>turn on aerial maneuver or whatever it </v>

463
00:20:07.891 --> 00:20:08.724
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're not reacting to something </v>

464
00:20:09.361 --> 00:20:10.020
<v Speaker 2>that's happening now.</v>

465
00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:12.510
<v Speaker 2>You're reacting to the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does that make sense?</v>

466
00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:13.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does make sense.</v>

467
00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:15.143
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I was a guy who had been surfing for </v>

468
00:20:15.931 --> 00:20:20.540
<v Speaker 2>30 years and I sucked and I was friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we would still love it still.</v>

469
00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:21.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>surfing's awesome.</v>

470
00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:24.360
<v Speaker 2>You can be the biggest Kook in the world</v>
<v Speaker 2>and have the most fun.</v>

471
00:20:24.361 --> 00:20:26.180
<v Speaker 2>That's why surfing's is that when </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who sucks,</v>

472
00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:28.120
<v Speaker 2>what's called a Kook?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

473
00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:31.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm a quick look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who is someone who has,</v>

474
00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:34.950
<v Speaker 2>who has no awareness in the water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

475
00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:37.860
<v Speaker 2>that's really what a cookie is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if like,</v>

476
00:20:37.861 --> 00:20:42.120
<v Speaker 2>if I'm out there surfing and I'm sitting</v>
<v Speaker 2>out there and I'm waiting for a wave and</v>

477
00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:46.020
<v Speaker 2>you paddle out and I've been waiting for</v>
<v Speaker 2>a wave or a long time or some,</v>

478
00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:47.800
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some girl,</v>

479
00:20:47.801 --> 00:20:48.100
<v Speaker 2>16</v>

480
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:50.380
<v Speaker 3>year old girls out there serving and </v>
<v Speaker 3>she's been waiting for,</v>

481
00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:51.101
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>15,</v>

482
00:20:51.101 --> 00:20:52.960
<v Speaker 3>20 minutes and you paddle out and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>paddle,</v>

483
00:20:52.961 --> 00:20:53.481
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pastor.</v>

484
00:20:53.481 --> 00:20:55.300
<v Speaker 3>And the next way that comes in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just turn around and go,</v>

485
00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:57.280
<v Speaker 3>you're a Kook.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

486
00:20:57.281 --> 00:20:58.114
<v Speaker 3>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's if you're unaware of the </v>

487
00:20:59.711 --> 00:21:00.820
<v Speaker 3>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

488
00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:03.490
<v Speaker 3>That's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's how people get in fights surfing,</v>

489
00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:04.990
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is common.</v>

490
00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:06.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

491
00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:09.670
<v Speaker 3>well a lot of surfers are really into </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu.</v>

492
00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:12.760
<v Speaker 3>Probably pretty dangerous to pick a </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight with a surfer.</v>

493
00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:14.380
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does that.</v>

494
00:21:14.381 --> 00:21:16.760
<v Speaker 3>One guy's named Joel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

495
00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:20.590
<v Speaker 3>from Hawaii.</v>
<v Speaker 3>From San Diego with the old tutor.</v>

496
00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:23.080
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a Brazilian jujitsu black belt.</v>

497
00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:23.980
<v Speaker 3>He is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

498
00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:25.280
<v Speaker 3>And you would never know it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

499
00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:27.190
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he looks like so unassuming.</v>

500
00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:30.150
<v Speaker 3>He looks like a guy who fixes computers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He is,</v>

501
00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:32.560
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's a Stoney Bologna.</v>

502
00:21:32.561 --> 00:21:36.220
<v Speaker 3>Super Skinny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hippie cruisy dude,</v>

503
00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:38.230
<v Speaker 3>like stony eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he'll fuck you up.</v>

504
00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:41.080
<v Speaker 3>He will fuck you up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he's cool,</v>

505
00:21:41.081 --> 00:21:41.620
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

506
00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:43.330
<v Speaker 3>he's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's an incredible surfer,</v>

507
00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:46.080
<v Speaker 3>incredible surfer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen some footage of him surf,</v>

508
00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:48.400
<v Speaker 3>amazing style and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's,</v>

509
00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:49.263
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

510
00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:51.460
<v Speaker 3>he's very unassuming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joel,</v>

511
00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:53.990
<v Speaker 3>his Jujitsu is super legit too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

512
00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.460
<v Speaker 3>I've talked to people that have trained </v>
<v Speaker 3>with him.</v>

513
00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:58.180
<v Speaker 3>He's super legit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'll tell you a real quick.</v>

514
00:21:58.210 --> 00:22:01.210
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine that from that </v>
<v Speaker 3>background,</v>

515
00:22:01.211 --> 00:22:05.170
<v Speaker 3>like surfing and that body awareness and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ability to adjust and change.</v>

516
00:22:05.171 --> 00:22:08.890
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the things about Jujitsu </v>
<v Speaker 3>is like every role is different.</v>

517
00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:09.773
<v Speaker 3>Your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have your rolling with different </v>

518
00:22:10.661 --> 00:22:11.494
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>different size people and your ability </v>

519
00:22:13.001 --> 00:22:16.120
<v Speaker 3>to adjust and change is always changing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's always movement.</v>

520
00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:19.690
<v Speaker 3>So he's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Adapt that weirdness of the movement.</v>

521
00:22:19.691 --> 00:22:20.524
<v Speaker 3>So Jujitsu and surfing or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they totally have their similarities </v>

522
00:22:22.571 --> 00:22:23.404
<v Speaker 3>because you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're sort of anticipating the guys </v>

523
00:22:24.731 --> 00:22:25.564
<v Speaker 3>next move,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is very similar to surfing on the </v>

524
00:22:27.041 --> 00:22:28.430
<v Speaker 3>wave,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

525
00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:30.520
<v Speaker 3>reacting to what that guys going to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the future.</v>

526
00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:31.960
<v Speaker 3>Not to what happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

527
00:22:31.961 --> 00:22:33.250
<v Speaker 3>That very second,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

528
00:22:33.251 --> 00:22:34.084
<v Speaker 3>A lot of times if I was a guy that had </v>
<v Speaker 3>been surfing for 30 years and I sucked </v>

529
00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:39.250
<v Speaker 3>and I knew you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be like,</v>

530
00:22:39.251 --> 00:22:40.330
<v Speaker 3>Hey Shane,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dorian,</v>

531
00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:43.780
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck am I doing wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do I fix this?</v>

532
00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:46.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

533
00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:50.020
<v Speaker 3>Is there fixing servings?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not like golf where you,</v>

534
00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:51.430
<v Speaker 3>where you need to get better all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

535
00:22:52.050 --> 00:22:53.120
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

536
00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:54.050
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

537
00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:56.050
<v Speaker 3>like if you can enjoy it even if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>suck,</v>

538
00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:59.200
<v Speaker 3>is that what you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you're a golfer and you and your</v>

539
00:22:59.270 --> 00:23:00.103
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] I'm not a golfer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you're a golfer and your average </v>

540
00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:04.720
<v Speaker 3>game is like an 82,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I said,</v>

541
00:23:04.721 --> 00:23:05.554
<v Speaker 3>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you buy this putter for a thousand </v>

542
00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:08.530
<v Speaker 3>dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your average score will be an 80.</v>

543
00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:10.113
<v Speaker 3>You're going to buy that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that putter because it's the freaking </v>

544
00:23:11.631 --> 00:23:13.600
<v Speaker 3>world to you to shave two strokes off </v>
<v Speaker 3>your game.</v>

545
00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:15.580
<v Speaker 3>That's the biggest thing in the world to</v>
<v Speaker 3>improve.</v>

546
00:23:16.150 --> 00:23:16.983
<v Speaker 3>No one gives a shit if they're slightly </v>
<v Speaker 3>better at surfing is all you care about </v>

547
00:23:21.911 --> 00:23:22.744
<v Speaker 3>is like the is like waking up at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>crack of dawn and having your coffee </v>

548
00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:26.343
<v Speaker 3>cruise down to the beach,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seeing the waves and reading the tides </v>

549
00:23:28.301 --> 00:23:31.690
<v Speaker 3>and the wind and the and like going </v>
<v Speaker 3>surfing with your buddies and having fun</v>

550
00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:35.320
<v Speaker 3>and then you go get breakfast and get </v>
<v Speaker 3>some breakfast tacos and go to work.</v>

551
00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:37.850
<v Speaker 3>That's the lifestyle is like keeps </v>
<v Speaker 3>people sane.</v>

552
00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:38.703
<v Speaker 3>That's why they do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't do it to get better or surf </v>

553
00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:43.000
<v Speaker 3>super good at or go really fast and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff's fun.</v>

554
00:23:43.001 --> 00:23:48.001
<v Speaker 3>But I mean I don't have any more fun </v>
<v Speaker 3>than a guy who serves.</v>

555
00:23:49.521 --> 00:23:51.840
<v Speaker 3>Have as good as me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have the same run,</v>

556
00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:54.680
<v Speaker 3>but I bet he wishes he could surf as </v>
<v Speaker 3>good as you.</v>

557
00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:55.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

558
00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:56.683
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I wish I served as good as the best </v>

559
00:23:57.651 --> 00:24:00.110
<v Speaker 3>stuff on earth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't make it more fun,</v>

560
00:24:00.111 --> 00:24:00.944
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

561
00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:03.410
<v Speaker 3>that's why I love surfing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's so cool.</v>

562
00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:05.990
<v Speaker 3>That's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what does it make it more?</v>

563
00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:08.960
<v Speaker 3>If you want to get better at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it doesn't make it more fun,</v>

564
00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:11.420
<v Speaker 3>what does it make it more?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does something.</v>

565
00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:13.533
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't make it more fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does it make it more satisfying if </v>

566
00:24:14.841 --> 00:24:17.210
<v Speaker 3>you're better at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when you surf at a high level,</v>

567
00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:18.403
<v Speaker 3>which is important to you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now it gives you more options because </v>

568
00:24:20.991 --> 00:24:22.120
<v Speaker 3>the waves get big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

569
00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:23.113
<v Speaker 3>Which makes it more fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's really difficult to surf really </v>

570
00:24:24.651 --> 00:24:26.900
<v Speaker 3>big waves with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with really low ability.</v>

571
00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:27.823
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when the waves get big and really </v>

572
00:24:29.571 --> 00:24:30.404
<v Speaker 3>heavy and technical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't go out there and unless you </v>

573
00:24:32.541 --> 00:24:34.340
<v Speaker 3>have really good ability to level like </v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

574
00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:38.750
<v Speaker 3>unless you have a high ability level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you really can't perform in really great</v>

575
00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:39.920
<v Speaker 3>great conditions.</v>

576
00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:40.963
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like when you see the crazy </v>

577
00:24:43.641 --> 00:24:47.900
<v Speaker 3>conditions were that you guys get towed </v>
<v Speaker 3>out and you ride those 80 foot waves,</v>

578
00:24:47.901 --> 00:24:50.660
<v Speaker 3>that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one who's goofy's doing that?</v>

579
00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:52.213
<v Speaker 3>There's some goofy guys doing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you're using machines to tell </v>

580
00:24:53.890 --> 00:24:55.010
<v Speaker 3>you in the waves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that you?</v>

581
00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:56.250
<v Speaker 3>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shane.</v>

582
00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:01.370
<v Speaker 3>Oh fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That just gives me such anxiety watching</v>

583
00:25:01.371 --> 00:25:02.570
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How big is that wave?</v>

584
00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:03.740
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dunno.</v>

585
00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:05.370
<v Speaker 3>Probably Sixty feet on the face of </v>
<v Speaker 3>start.</v>

586
00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:08.000
<v Speaker 3>Damn son.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

587
00:25:08.001 --> 00:25:09.860
<v Speaker 3>what does that feel like right there </v>
<v Speaker 3>when it's over.</v>

588
00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:11.030
<v Speaker 3>This part's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Watch.</v>

589
00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:13.680
<v Speaker 3>I get air on the way down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

590
00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:16.330
<v Speaker 3>See my board because completely an error</v>
<v Speaker 3>right there.</v>

591
00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:21.650
<v Speaker 3>Do you are so high.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is so high.</v>

592
00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:22.993
<v Speaker 3>Is so giant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like 40 feet above your head right </v>

593
00:25:25.581 --> 00:25:27.590
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

594
00:25:27.591 --> 00:25:29.660
<v Speaker 3>This gives me anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what's cool about surfing is in</v>

595
00:25:29.661 --> 00:25:30.494
<v Speaker 3>those moments,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's very few things in the </v>

596
00:25:32.421 --> 00:25:34.970
<v Speaker 3>world other than like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

597
00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.250
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how to relate that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm like,</v>

598
00:25:37.251 --> 00:25:41.930
<v Speaker 3>that moment right there for me was like </v>
<v Speaker 3>the pinnacle of like who I am,</v>

599
00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:45.230
<v Speaker 3>what I do best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That moment,</v>

600
00:25:45.231 --> 00:25:47.870
<v Speaker 3>that wave coming in at that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at that minute in my life where I was in</v>

601
00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:51.320
<v Speaker 3>a right square foot of the ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when that wave came in,</v>

602
00:25:51.321 --> 00:25:53.630
<v Speaker 3>that was Beth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was one of the best days in history</v>

603
00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:55.430
<v Speaker 3>at that of spot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

604
00:25:55.490 --> 00:25:56.630
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was there.</v>

605
00:25:56.631 --> 00:25:57.710
<v Speaker 3>I was prepared.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was healthy.</v>

606
00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:59.030
<v Speaker 3>Have the right board,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the right equipment,</v>

607
00:25:59.031 --> 00:26:00.740
<v Speaker 3>the right energy level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't sick.</v>

608
00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:02.360
<v Speaker 3>I didn't have any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

609
00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:03.823
<v Speaker 3>everything was just lined up and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>waves are lined up and the swell was </v>

610
00:26:05.841 --> 00:26:06.674
<v Speaker 3>lined up and the wind was line up and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the tide was lined up and I was in a </v>

611
00:26:08.541 --> 00:26:11.360
<v Speaker 3>perfect spot when that wave came in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you watch the video all the time?</v>

612
00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:13.310
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but every time I do,</v>

613
00:26:13.311 --> 00:26:16.010
<v Speaker 3>I remember all those things because it </v>
<v Speaker 3>seems so much so,</v>

614
00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:16.873
<v Speaker 3>so much luck had to do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just like a line in the stars </v>

615
00:26:19.341 --> 00:26:20.174
<v Speaker 3>aligning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That almost seems like something I'd </v>

616
00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:22.520
<v Speaker 3>want to watch every day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

617
00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:24.050
<v Speaker 3>get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get the day going.</v>

618
00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:26.720
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your first kiss from a girl.</v>

619
00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:28.760
<v Speaker 3>That's what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

620
00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:32.590
<v Speaker 3>That like mind blown.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

621
00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:33.543
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is like an important moment in my </v>

622
00:26:35.061 --> 00:26:37.730
<v Speaker 3>life and I need to like have this moment</v>
<v Speaker 3>in time frozen.</v>

623
00:26:37.731 --> 00:26:40.610
<v Speaker 3>That's what that is right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I think as an adult,</v>

624
00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:43.410
<v Speaker 3>you very rarely have those moments left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

625
00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:43.990
<v Speaker 3>I</v>

626
00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:48.150
<v Speaker 2>really like mind expanding mind </v>
<v Speaker 2>exploding moments where you're like,</v>

627
00:26:48.151 --> 00:26:51.300
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is life 100 percent life right now,</v>

628
00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:54.120
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I think we're all chasing.</v>

629
00:26:54.121 --> 00:26:54.954
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those people sitting in traffic outside </v>

630
00:26:56.011 --> 00:26:58.410
<v Speaker 2>right now driving on the freeway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not having those moments.</v>

631
00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:00.980
<v Speaker 4>Not right then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a real problem.</v>

632
00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:02.023
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a real problem with life is that </v>

633
00:27:03.051 --> 00:27:04.610
<v Speaker 4>people aren't having enough of those </v>
<v Speaker 4>moments</v>

634
00:27:04.610 --> 00:27:05.443
<v Speaker 2>and when you're a 75 yards away from </v>
<v Speaker 2>that elc a few weeks ago and you had an </v>

635
00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:11.473
<v Speaker 2>hour to to really think about what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing and where you were in your </v>

636
00:27:13.581 --> 00:27:18.581
<v Speaker 2>life and how you know how you got to 75 </v>
<v Speaker 2>yards away from this animal to the whole</v>

637
00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:20.143
<v Speaker 2>year of practicing on the target and all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the millions of arrows you shot and all </v>

638
00:27:23.121 --> 00:27:23.954
<v Speaker 2>the preparation that isn't in this thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>stands up and time's ticking and that </v>

639
00:27:28.701 --> 00:27:32.930
<v Speaker 2>moment is there for the taking and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>so easy to fuck up and it.</v>

640
00:27:33.050 --> 00:27:36.290
<v Speaker 2>It all happens the way that you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You hope to visualize it.</v>

641
00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.100
<v Speaker 2>Those moments don't happen very often,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

642
00:27:39.670 --> 00:27:40.503
<v Speaker 4>No they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that is what would a lot of people </v>

643
00:27:42.731 --> 00:27:46.990
<v Speaker 4>like yourself or myself or chasing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're always chasing these,</v>

644
00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:52.380
<v Speaker 4>these above average moments,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these high level moments,</v>

645
00:27:52.391 --> 00:27:55.060
<v Speaker 4>these moments where it just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything's elevated.</v>

646
00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:56.273
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like when you're drawn back on a big </v>

647
00:27:57.971 --> 00:28:00.430
<v Speaker 4>elk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's not another thing in your mind.</v>

648
00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:01.453
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing on your mind other than </v>
<v Speaker 4>your shot execution and getting it done </v>

649
00:28:04.211 --> 00:28:07.570
<v Speaker 4>and everything's heightened and all this</v>
<v Speaker 4>pressure around you.</v>

650
00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:08.553
<v Speaker 4>Some guys shake,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I've seen some guys drawn back on </v>

651
00:28:10.811 --> 00:28:13.900
<v Speaker 4>an animal and that their arms are </v>
<v Speaker 4>shaking like they're shaking.</v>

652
00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:16.780
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like did you see it in everything?</v>

653
00:28:16.810 --> 00:28:19.030
<v Speaker 4>So much anticipation that could barely </v>
<v Speaker 4>keep it together.</v>

654
00:28:19.031 --> 00:28:20.410
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what target panic is,</v>

655
00:28:20.411 --> 00:28:23.010
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like there's all this freak out.</v>

656
00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:24.210
<v Speaker 4>Just different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

657
00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:25.030
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's</v>

658
00:28:25.030 --> 00:28:26.380
<v Speaker 2>a lot of different levels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

659
00:28:26.410 --> 00:28:30.970
<v Speaker 2>Well I've seen guys do that where they </v>
<v Speaker 2>had a perfect shot opportunity,</v>

660
00:28:31.090 --> 00:28:31.923
<v Speaker 2>animal standing 20 yards away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Broadside exactly what you pray for and </v>

661
00:28:36.011 --> 00:28:37.930
<v Speaker 2>they get into the shakes and you have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>let down,</v>

662
00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:39.490
<v Speaker 2>let down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

663
00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:41.480
<v Speaker 2>Didn't even take a bad shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'd let down and just got.</v>

664
00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:43.420
<v Speaker 2>I can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just too much anxiety.</v>

665
00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:45.140
<v Speaker 4>It's probably better than shooting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

666
00:28:45.141 --> 00:28:46.280
<v Speaker 4>that's much better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

667
00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:47.150
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Smart.</v>

668
00:28:47.150 --> 00:28:47.850
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

669
00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:49.460
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's an aware person.</v>

670
00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:50.720
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is.</v>

671
00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:54.530
<v Speaker 4>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think human beings are meant to have a</v>

672
00:28:54.531 --> 00:28:55.364
<v Speaker 4>lot of those kinds of experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those experiences make life richer and </v>

673
00:28:58.221 --> 00:28:59.560
<v Speaker 4>more satisfying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

674
00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:00.613
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sounds like two people who love animals </v>

675
00:29:02.511 --> 00:29:02.901
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

676
00:29:02.901 --> 00:29:03.734
<v Speaker 4>you piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want to kill an animal that makes </v>

677
00:29:05.031 --> 00:29:07.960
<v Speaker 4>life better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not that like you're,</v>

678
00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.090
<v Speaker 4>you're eating meat no matter what.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel better when I eat meat.</v>

679
00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:12.163
<v Speaker 4>I believe it's healthier.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have had these discussions with </v>

680
00:29:13.791 --> 00:29:17.840
<v Speaker 4>nutritionists and scientists and I just </v>
<v Speaker 4>think it's better for you.</v>

681
00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:18.733
<v Speaker 4>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And for me to get it that way is way </v>

682
00:29:21.681 --> 00:29:22.514
<v Speaker 4>better because I'm getting my meat along</v>
<v Speaker 4>with this insane hobby that's super </v>

683
00:29:27.981 --> 00:29:28.814
<v Speaker 4>difficult to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I could go out and just shoot a </v>

684
00:29:30.471 --> 00:29:31.304
<v Speaker 4>bunch of pigs with a rifle and I could </v>
<v Speaker 4>get my meat that way and it would still </v>

685
00:29:35.091 --> 00:29:35.720
<v Speaker 4>be fun.</v>

686
00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:37.700
<v Speaker 4>It would still be thrilling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would still be ethical.</v>

687
00:29:38.150 --> 00:29:41.060
<v Speaker 4>Wouldn't be the same though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it not the same experience?</v>

688
00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:42.280
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

689
00:29:42.281 --> 00:29:43.114
<v Speaker 4>do you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you,</v>

690
00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:45.100
<v Speaker 4>do you want 100 percent?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just for meat.</v>

691
00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:47.950
<v Speaker 4>You can get me to the store.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the experience of that,</v>

692
00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:50.900
<v Speaker 4>of those moments out there with your </v>
<v Speaker 4>friends and the under the pressure and,</v>

693
00:29:50.901 --> 00:29:51.790
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

694
00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:54.880
<v Speaker 4>and just putting yourself in that </v>
<v Speaker 4>position where you like,</v>

695
00:29:54.881 --> 00:29:56.720
<v Speaker 4>you need to make it count.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>

696
00:29:56.721 --> 00:29:57.554
<v Speaker 4>That's part of our human existence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's part of what makes life worth </v>

697
00:30:00.731 --> 00:30:03.040
<v Speaker 4>living is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is his habit.</v>

698
00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:04.480
<v Speaker 4>Having to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know,</v>

699
00:30:04.481 --> 00:30:09.481
<v Speaker 4>but just were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

700
00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:11.423
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

701
00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:13.493
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

702
00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:15.430
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know what you mean.</v>

703
00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:16.473
<v Speaker 4>You can get me to the store,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you can get wild elk at the store </v>

704
00:30:19.090 --> 00:30:19.923
<v Speaker 4>and you can't get it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's just such a giant difference </v>

705
00:30:22.961 --> 00:30:25.810
<v Speaker 4>between your relationship with the meat </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you're eating.</v>

706
00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:30.990
<v Speaker 4>When I take an elk steak out of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>freezer and defrost it and I season it,</v>

707
00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:33.490
<v Speaker 4>your food looks amazing by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like really,</v>

708
00:30:33.491 --> 00:30:34.670
<v Speaker 4>really good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

709
00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:35.583
<v Speaker 4>They are getting good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The week after you were in an elk camp </v>

710
00:30:38.411 --> 00:30:40.510
<v Speaker 4>and Utah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were there with Chad Ward,</v>

711
00:30:40.650 --> 00:30:43.330
<v Speaker 4>a whiskey whiskey bent barbecue on </v>
<v Speaker 4>instagram.</v>

712
00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:47.290
<v Speaker 4>Who's a master chef.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a fucking wizard.</v>

713
00:30:47.291 --> 00:30:49.960
<v Speaker 4>He's a pitmaster winds like those world </v>
<v Speaker 4>championships.</v>

714
00:30:49.970 --> 00:30:52.510
<v Speaker 4>And he taught me how to cook it </v>
<v Speaker 4>properly.</v>

715
00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:53.710
<v Speaker 4>That was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

716
00:30:53.711 --> 00:30:54.544
<v Speaker 4>it's all about doing it slow and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>searing it afterwards and you just </v>

717
00:30:57.880 --> 00:30:59.800
<v Speaker 4>maintain all the people threw that up.</v>

718
00:31:00.370 --> 00:31:01.350
<v Speaker 4>Everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

719
00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:02.253
<v Speaker 4>Even one of the guides,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the guides was talking to me </v>

720
00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:04.440
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

721
00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:07.210
<v Speaker 4>who said wild game is kind of tough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we're like,</v>

722
00:31:07.211 --> 00:31:08.650
<v Speaker 4>well how are you cooking?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>

723
00:31:08.651 --> 00:31:09.880
<v Speaker 4>well I'll just throw it on the grill.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

724
00:31:09.881 --> 00:31:10.960
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't do that.</v>

725
00:31:10.990 --> 00:31:13.420
<v Speaker 4>You can't just do it on high heat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>high heat.</v>

726
00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:18.550
<v Speaker 4>Basically sear it and then serve it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is not Sashimi,</v>

727
00:31:18.690 --> 00:31:21.820
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well you can if you do it real thin,</v>

728
00:31:21.850 --> 00:31:23.770
<v Speaker 4>slice it crazy thin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

729
00:31:23.771 --> 00:31:25.870
<v Speaker 4>You can click.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not bad,</v>

730
00:31:26.170 --> 00:31:29.600
<v Speaker 4>but it's way better if you do a low and </v>
<v Speaker 4>slow.</v>

731
00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:33.220
<v Speaker 4>I've brought it down to 2:25</v>
<v Speaker 4>now I like to cook it at 2:25.</v>

732
00:31:33.410 --> 00:31:35.140
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just set it at 2:25</v>

733
00:31:35.141 --> 00:31:36.090
<v Speaker 4>and I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll cook a,</v>

734
00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:39.510
<v Speaker 4>an elk steak for fucking an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

735
00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:40.900
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a trigger.</v>

736
00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:42.280
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because you.</v>

737
00:31:42.281 --> 00:31:43.114
<v Speaker 4>If you set a trigger to 25 users setting</v>
<v Speaker 4>called super smoke and so just fills </v>

738
00:31:47.081 --> 00:31:47.914
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the inside of those things are so good </v>

739
00:31:49.691 --> 00:31:50.524
<v Speaker 4>for wild game.</v>

740
00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:51.940
<v Speaker 4>It really fast it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

741
00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:52.893
<v Speaker 4>it's all just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The beautiful thing about them is the </v>

742
00:31:54.761 --> 00:31:55.840
<v Speaker 4>people don't know what we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>

743
00:31:55.870 --> 00:31:56.703
<v Speaker 4>A trigger is a pellet grill and these </v>
<v Speaker 4>pellet grills like this tables made out </v>

744
00:32:00.401 --> 00:32:01.210
<v Speaker 4>of Oak,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

745
00:32:01.210 --> 00:32:02.043
<v Speaker 4>When they cut this table,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they would take the sawdust from this </v>

746
00:32:05.201 --> 00:32:08.570
<v Speaker 4>table and they compress it and just </v>
<v Speaker 4>using the natural sugars in the woods.</v>

747
00:32:08.571 --> 00:32:12.100
<v Speaker 4>They create these pellets and then these</v>
<v Speaker 4>pellet grills,</v>

748
00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:13.653
<v Speaker 4>they have these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a worm drives that feed these pellets </v>

749
00:32:16.151 --> 00:32:18.220
<v Speaker 4>into a heating element and the heating </v>
<v Speaker 4>element,</v>

750
00:32:18.250 --> 00:32:19.083
<v Speaker 4>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just gets hot and then fire and then </v>

751
00:32:21.550 --> 00:32:22.383
<v Speaker 4>a fan blows in the fire to keep the fire</v>
<v Speaker 4>going and it's all computer controlled </v>

752
00:32:25.691 --> 00:32:29.090
<v Speaker 4>so it calculates exact same temperature </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it maintains that temperature.</v>

753
00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:31.150
<v Speaker 4>It's so good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's just so pure.</v>

754
00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:34.450
<v Speaker 4>It's just wood and fire.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No Gas,</v>

755
00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:37.990
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No chemicals like on charcoal briquettes</v>

756
00:32:37.991 --> 00:32:40.210
<v Speaker 4>or no bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it tastes so good off the things.</v>

757
00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:41.953
<v Speaker 1>Every time I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time I have people over at my </v>

758
00:32:43.101 --> 00:32:44.750
<v Speaker 1>house and I cook wild game on my </v>
<v Speaker 1>trigger,</v>

759
00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:46.820
<v Speaker 1>I have these people like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell I need to get one of these</v>

760
00:32:46.821 --> 00:32:48.290
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've made lots of sold like a million of</v>

761
00:32:48.291 --> 00:32:51.410
<v Speaker 1>them right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you learn how to cook with them and</v>

762
00:32:51.411 --> 00:32:54.100
<v Speaker 1>learn how to do it correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have those little ones.</v>

763
00:32:54.101 --> 00:32:56.510
<v Speaker 1>Especially wild game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wild game is really easy to screw up and</v>

764
00:32:56.511 --> 00:32:57.344
<v Speaker 1>it's really hard to screw it up on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>trigger really because of the fact that </v>

765
00:32:59.961 --> 00:33:01.450
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't have much fat in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

766
00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:03.490
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't dry it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't cook out though.</v>

767
00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:04.583
<v Speaker 1>You know the moisture and the right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you take yours afterwards and set it </v>

768
00:33:08.211 --> 00:33:11.000
<v Speaker 1>in a cooler to let it rest?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't do that.</v>

769
00:33:11.001 --> 00:33:12.830
<v Speaker 1>That's next level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it excellent.</v>

770
00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:16.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting gems here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gold.</v>

771
00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:17.120
<v Speaker 1>This is from Dudley.</v>

772
00:33:17.810 --> 00:33:18.643
<v Speaker 1>He does is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'll sear it and then he'll cover it </v>

773
00:33:20.601 --> 00:33:24.470
<v Speaker 1>with aluminum foil and put it in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>trigger or put it in a Yeti.</v>

774
00:33:24.471 --> 00:33:25.304
<v Speaker 1>Rather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Put it in a cooler clothes seal that </v>

775
00:33:26.961 --> 00:33:27.794
<v Speaker 1>cooler up for like 10 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what's in the cooler besides the </v>

776
00:33:30.141 --> 00:33:31.070
<v Speaker 1>meat?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>

777
00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:34.540
<v Speaker 1>There's no like a little like ice </v>
<v Speaker 1>packard and like that'd be nice.</v>

778
00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:35.413
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to just let it sit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually still cooking so I let it </v>

779
00:33:38.101 --> 00:33:39.260
<v Speaker 1>sit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I let it sit,</v>

780
00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:40.810
<v Speaker 1>but I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't wrap it up.</v>

781
00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:44.510
<v Speaker 1>And if you wrap it in aluminum foil and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then let it sit inside the cooler,</v>

782
00:33:44.511 --> 00:33:48.050
<v Speaker 1>the cooler actually allows it to </v>
<v Speaker 1>continue coaching just a little bit.</v>

783
00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:48.913
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how many degrees do you take it out </v>

784
00:33:49.551 --> 00:33:51.020
<v Speaker 1>before?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One 15.</v>

785
00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:51.913
<v Speaker 1>I like to take it out at 1:15.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I see her the outside of it and </v>

786
00:33:54.261 --> 00:33:55.094
<v Speaker 1>then I seal it up with aluminum foil and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I put it in the Yeti and I let it </v>

787
00:33:58.851 --> 00:34:00.560
<v Speaker 1>sit in that Yeti for 10 minutes.</v>

788
00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:04.190
<v Speaker 1>So it's continuing to slowly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slowly.</v>

789
00:34:04.191 --> 00:34:06.890
<v Speaker 1>Because if you take something warm and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you put it in the Yeti,</v>

790
00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:08.140
<v Speaker 1>it'll keep it warm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

791
00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:09.253
<v Speaker 1>If you take something called it just </v>
<v Speaker 1>insulate and incredibly fantastically </v>

792
00:34:11.841 --> 00:34:14.490
<v Speaker 1>insulated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it works with heat or with cold.</v>

793
00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:15.231
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

794
00:34:15.231 --> 00:34:16.370
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to try it.</v>

795
00:34:16.430 --> 00:34:19.170
<v Speaker 1>I talked to Doug,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the wizard at this stuff,</v>

796
00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:20.263
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

797
00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:23.210
<v Speaker 1>and he's constantly cooking wild game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He essentially,</v>

798
00:34:23.211 --> 00:34:24.260
<v Speaker 1>that's all he does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A good cook.</v>

799
00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:25.380
<v Speaker 1>So very good cook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

800
00:34:25.910 --> 00:34:27.230
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever been to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It should be.</v>

801
00:34:27.330 --> 00:34:30.740
<v Speaker 1>She freaking does a lot of hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He better be doing a to cook and to.</v>

802
00:34:30.830 --> 00:34:31.663
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just drove all the way from Oklahoma </v>

803
00:34:33.890 --> 00:34:34.870
<v Speaker 1>to Kansas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

804
00:34:34.890 --> 00:34:39.320
<v Speaker 1>he shot a deer in Kansas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drove from or not Kansas,</v>

805
00:34:39.321 --> 00:34:41.270
<v Speaker 1>Oklahoma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shot a deer in Oklahoma,</v>

806
00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:46.070
<v Speaker 1>drove all through the night in Oklahoma </v>
<v Speaker 1>and parked his truck and got into a,</v>

807
00:34:46.071 --> 00:34:48.110
<v Speaker 1>a blind in Iowa.</v>

808
00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:50.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just lives it and he's hard core.</v>

809
00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:52.770
<v Speaker 1>He's as hardcore as you get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

810
00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:54.440
<v Speaker 1>but that's all he eats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's,</v>

811
00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:55.453
<v Speaker 1>he's constantly eating deer and cooking </v>
<v Speaker 1>deer and he loves cooking for other </v>

<v Speaker 1>people are like large groups of friends </v>
<v Speaker 1>and family and he's always cooking and </v>

<v Speaker 1>I love that about him.</v>

815
00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:08.450
<v Speaker 1>Like when he cooked for 10 of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's frigging awesome.</v>

818
00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:13.850
<v Speaker 1>That Lanai trip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

819
00:35:14.610 --> 00:35:17.420
<v Speaker 1>I look forward to that every year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a highlight of my year,</v>

820
00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:19.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are we doing it this year?</v>

821
00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:20.140
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

822
00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:20.973
<v Speaker 1>We got to talk with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>GotTa.</v>

823
00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:22.213
<v Speaker 1>You gotta talk dates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got to figure out the dates </v>

824
00:35:23.850 --> 00:35:27.790
<v Speaker 1>because that last year was so amazing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have everybody down there and you know,</v>

825
00:35:27.870 --> 00:35:30.290
<v Speaker 1>everybody is such a good crew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So fucking cool.</v>

826
00:35:30.291 --> 00:35:32.120
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>green tree and cam and.</v>

827
00:35:32.690 --> 00:35:34.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just awesome.</v>

828
00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:35.173
<v Speaker 1>And then the first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first year we invented the cat lady </v>

829
00:35:36.741 --> 00:35:37.574
<v Speaker 1>drink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

830
00:35:37.810 --> 00:35:38.020
<v Speaker 1>That</v>

831
00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:39.870
<v Speaker 3>one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

832
00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:41.363
<v Speaker 3>That was ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Dudley might be still drinking </v>

833
00:35:43.011 --> 00:35:45.630
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think anybody else has died off.</v>

834
00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:48.240
<v Speaker 3>Red Bull and wine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what was it?</v>

835
00:35:48.241 --> 00:35:51.530
<v Speaker 3>Tequila.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was the lab a little bit ambitious.</v>

836
00:35:51.531 --> 00:35:55.140
<v Speaker 3>So that was a fucking nasty because it </v>
<v Speaker 3>definitely was a deadly concoction.</v>

837
00:35:55.170 --> 00:35:56.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was already hammered.</v>

838
00:35:56.101 --> 00:35:58.800
<v Speaker 3>He was just rated my mini bar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just take whatever's in.</v>

839
00:35:58.820 --> 00:36:01.240
<v Speaker 3>There is like a mad scientist at </v>
<v Speaker 3>liquors,</v>

840
00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:02.970
<v Speaker 3>isn't he?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not afraid.</v>

841
00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:07.260
<v Speaker 3>That was such a fun podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we're all just enjoy it.</v>

842
00:36:07.290 --> 00:36:08.123
<v Speaker 3>It's something about Lanai to where you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can hunt in paradise and it's such a </v>

843
00:36:12.121 --> 00:36:15.000
<v Speaker 3>small island.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you'd use,</v>

844
00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:17.610
<v Speaker 3>there's not very many people there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The whole island,</v>

845
00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:18.473
<v Speaker 3>last 3000 humans and shitload a deer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy around every Bush scene it </v>

846
00:36:22.891 --> 00:36:24.440
<v Speaker 3>seems like sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

847
00:36:24.570 --> 00:36:28.070
<v Speaker 3>that's a great thing is it's so easy to </v>
<v Speaker 3>screw up hunting those access deer,</v>

848
00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:28.913
<v Speaker 3>especially with a bow that it's so neat </v>
<v Speaker 3>to go and like find your Arrow and then </v>

849
00:36:31.870 --> 00:36:32.703
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five minutes later you got a whole </v>

850
00:36:33.571 --> 00:36:34.530
<v Speaker 3>nother group of stock.</v>

851
00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:35.821
<v Speaker 3>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

852
00:36:35.821 --> 00:36:36.654
<v Speaker 3>it's also the most ethical form of </v>
<v Speaker 3>hunting because they literally need to </v>

853
00:36:39.661 --> 00:36:40.950
<v Speaker 3>be hunted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have to be.</v>

854
00:36:40.951 --> 00:36:43.290
<v Speaker 3>They don't have any predators.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a.</v>

855
00:36:43.590 --> 00:36:47.220
<v Speaker 3>and it's not something that some person </v>
<v Speaker 3>who was a greedy person said,</v>

856
00:36:47.221 --> 00:36:48.054
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to put all these deer in the </v>

857
00:36:48.391 --> 00:36:49.500
<v Speaker 3>silent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then I'm going to go hunt them.</v>

858
00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:50.743
<v Speaker 3>Now they were brought there for a gift </v>
<v Speaker 3>for King Kamehameha in the 18 hundreds </v>

859
00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:55.733
<v Speaker 3>and it doesn't take a wildlife biologist</v>
<v Speaker 3>to tell you that the numbers will get </v>

860
00:36:58.471 --> 00:36:59.900
<v Speaker 3>out of hand if you don't hunt them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

861
00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:01.500
<v Speaker 3>Like when you're there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really obvious.</v>

862
00:37:01.501 --> 00:37:03.290
<v Speaker 3>That's a perfect example of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

863
00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:06.900
<v Speaker 3>of how somewhere needs to be managed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

864
00:37:07.050 --> 00:37:07.883
<v Speaker 3>and I know those guys on Maui have that </v>
<v Speaker 3>project going on where they're hunting </v>

865
00:37:10.801 --> 00:37:13.490
<v Speaker 3>deer and then giving the meat to poor </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

866
00:37:14.070 --> 00:37:15.840
<v Speaker 3>which is the best meat in the world.</v>

867
00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:16.673
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's such an accident right here </v>
<v Speaker 3>is so delicious and that's a great </v>

868
00:37:20.131 --> 00:37:22.230
<v Speaker 3>program.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a fantastic program.</v>

869
00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:23.750
<v Speaker 3>What is the name of that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's got some.</v>

870
00:37:24.330 --> 00:37:25.163
<v Speaker 3>That's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's Jake Muse and like a Hickey knew </v>

871
00:37:27.181 --> 00:37:28.500
<v Speaker 3>he project.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

872
00:37:28.501 --> 00:37:31.470
<v Speaker 3>that's the name he knew he project.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See you're from Hawaii.</v>

873
00:37:31.471 --> 00:37:35.550
<v Speaker 3>You can spit those words out my mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

874
00:37:36.150 --> 00:37:36.983
<v Speaker 3>it's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a.</v>

875
00:37:37.290 --> 00:37:38.580
<v Speaker 3>You should have jake on the show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

876
00:37:38.610 --> 00:37:39.443
<v Speaker 3>he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a really good dude and he's got </v>

877
00:37:40.381 --> 00:37:41.214
<v Speaker 3>some great stories and he's really well </v>
<v Speaker 3>educated and knows this business really </v>

878
00:37:43.891 --> 00:37:45.300
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he started meat company.</v>

879
00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:48.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he does eradication in Hawaii because</v>

880
00:37:48.631 --> 00:37:50.470
<v Speaker 3>it needs to be done and needs to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>managed.</v>

881
00:37:50.471 --> 00:37:51.570
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're on Maui.</v>

882
00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:52.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so he,</v>

883
00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:54.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wanted to,</v>

884
00:37:54.190 --> 00:37:56.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be able to actually utilize that meat</v>

885
00:37:56.761 --> 00:37:57.511
<v Speaker 3>because he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

886
00:37:57.511 --> 00:37:59.160
<v Speaker 3>these big ranches and golf courses and </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>

887
00:37:59.161 --> 00:37:59.994
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they actually pay him to come in there </v>

888
00:38:00.781 --> 00:38:01.614
<v Speaker 3>and do it and so he actually flipped it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and figured out a way to start a neat </v>

889
00:38:05.221 --> 00:38:06.000
<v Speaker 3>company.</v>

890
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:06.833
<v Speaker 3>So it's like a win win situation because</v>
<v Speaker 3>the deer need to be managed and you </v>

891
00:38:09.831 --> 00:38:10.664
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's feeding people and then the Kikino </v>

892
00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:12.543
<v Speaker 3>he projects totally different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he doesn't have a meat company for </v>

893
00:38:13.951 --> 00:38:14.784
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's able to harvest the animals in </v>

894
00:38:16.831 --> 00:38:17.664
<v Speaker 3>a really good way and then he's able to </v>
<v Speaker 3>utilize that meet by giving it to </v>

895
00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:22.410
<v Speaker 3>families who need it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Simple as that.</v>

896
00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:24.680
<v Speaker 3>It's just phenomenal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's great.</v>

897
00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:25.733
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's meat that people would pay a </v>

898
00:38:27.481 --> 00:38:30.210
<v Speaker 3>shitload of money for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would be like if,</v>

899
00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:31.133
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you could buy commercially raised </v>

900
00:38:33.150 --> 00:38:36.220
<v Speaker 3>access dear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would be one of the prized meets</v>

901
00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:39.880
<v Speaker 4>because it's such an unusual flavor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's extremely delicious.</v>

902
00:38:39.881 --> 00:38:42.430
<v Speaker 4>And people that don't like wild game and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were like,</v>

903
00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:43.273
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not really into Venice and I would </v>

904
00:38:43.811 --> 00:38:45.550
<v Speaker 4>like to cook access to care for them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd be like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>me what you think because I've cooked it</v>

906

<v Speaker 4>she was,</v>

908
00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:53.620
<v Speaker 4>she like took one bite of it and raise </v>
<v Speaker 4>her eyebrows.</v>

909
00:38:53.621 --> 00:38:54.790
<v Speaker 4>And she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is this?</v>

910

<v Speaker 4>so delicious.</v>

914
00:39:03.310 --> 00:39:05.200
<v Speaker 4>It's cool to baffle somebody with wild </v>
<v Speaker 4>game.</v>

915
00:39:05.370 --> 00:39:06.120
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:19.713
<v Speaker 4>Well what I like about them is we </v>
<v Speaker 4>generally go on this access to your </v>

923
00:39:22.451 --> 00:39:24.580
<v Speaker 4>haunt like a couple of months for elk </v>
<v Speaker 4>season.</v>

924
00:39:24.850 --> 00:39:27.580
<v Speaker 4>So you get all the jitters out of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>way because they are,</v>

925
00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:32.290
<v Speaker 4>they are like seven times faster than </v>
<v Speaker 4>you think.</v>

926
00:39:32.291 --> 00:39:36.160
<v Speaker 4>An animal that size can be like when </v>
<v Speaker 4>they move you like how did you,</v>

927
00:39:36.190 --> 00:39:39.880
<v Speaker 4>how did it even do that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like how does something move that fast?</v>

928
00:39:39.881 --> 00:39:40.714
<v Speaker 4>It's that didn't straighten matrix,</v>
<v Speaker 4>straight matrix and the access to </v>

929
00:39:43.710 --> 00:39:44.543
<v Speaker 4>arrows.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm probably going to Piss some people </v>

930
00:39:45.341 --> 00:39:47.890
<v Speaker 4>off by saying this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the axis deer in Hawaii or different</v>

931
00:39:48.490 --> 00:39:53.490
<v Speaker 4>axis deer in Hawaii or different Benny </v>
<v Speaker 4>O'bryan when we're on the NIH and he was</v>

932
00:39:54.071 --> 00:39:56.590
<v Speaker 4>hunting access to her,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he had.</v>

933
00:39:57.100 --> 00:39:58.570
<v Speaker 4>It was very challenging,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>

934
00:39:58.571 --> 00:39:59.380
<v Speaker 4>very challenging.</v>

935
00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:00.213
<v Speaker 4>They were ducking arrows and matrices.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just he was having a hard time and he </v>

936
00:40:03.851 --> 00:40:06.040
<v Speaker 4>went back to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He went back home,</v>

937
00:40:06.070 --> 00:40:07.870
<v Speaker 4>back to Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>back to the drawing board and said,</v>

938
00:40:07.871 --> 00:40:08.351
<v Speaker 4>I got.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got,</v>

939
00:40:08.351 --> 00:40:09.184
<v Speaker 4>I got to go hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He went and hunted access deer first </v>

940
00:40:10.841 --> 00:40:12.910
<v Speaker 4>morning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shot a huge buck and he called me.</v>

941
00:40:12.911 --> 00:40:13.900
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I shot a huge buck,</v>

942
00:40:13.901 --> 00:40:15.160
<v Speaker 4>and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I got to tell you,</v>

943
00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:16.823
<v Speaker 4>they're fucking different in Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did the deer just don't react the same </v>

944
00:40:20.951 --> 00:40:21.790
<v Speaker 4>way?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

945
00:40:21.791 --> 00:40:23.200
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in Hawaii,</v>

946
00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:25.660
<v Speaker 4>Hawaiians,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no season,</v>

947
00:40:25.661 --> 00:40:26.494
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Hawaiians are eating that meat 365 </v>

948
00:40:29.261 --> 00:40:30.330
<v Speaker 4>days a year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're,</v>

949
00:40:30.331 --> 00:40:32.720
<v Speaker 4>they're hunting them with high powered </v>
<v Speaker 4>rifles all year long.</v>

950
00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:33.900
<v Speaker 4>My Maui,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Molokai,</v>

951
00:40:33.901 --> 00:40:35.530
<v Speaker 4>Ella and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

952
00:40:35.531 --> 00:40:38.290
<v Speaker 4>those deer are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they just react like crazy.</v>

953
00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:40.830
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're living in hell every day.</v>

954
00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:42.940
<v Speaker 4>The Paradise,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but living in paradise,</v>

955
00:40:42.941 --> 00:40:43.600
<v Speaker 4>it's also a hell.</v>

956
00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:45.130
<v Speaker 4>Every day they're getting shot at.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

957
00:40:45.170 --> 00:40:47.870
<v Speaker 4>there's a good reason they're paranoid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

958
00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:49.810
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dan said in Texas,</v>

959
00:40:49.811 --> 00:40:51.670
<v Speaker 4>they were just like head down feeding </v>
<v Speaker 4>children.</v>

960
00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:53.590
<v Speaker 4>They had no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was like,</v>

961
00:40:53.591 --> 00:40:54.550
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like a different breed.</v>

962
00:40:55.270 --> 00:40:59.650
<v Speaker 4>But he was also there during the Rut to </v>
<v Speaker 4>get a little bit more relaxed during the</v>

963
00:40:59.651 --> 00:41:00.251
<v Speaker 4>rough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

964
00:41:00.251 --> 00:41:02.710
<v Speaker 4>They're switched on in Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but in,</v>

965
00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:03.821
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in Hawaii,</v>

966
00:41:03.821 --> 00:41:04.654
<v Speaker 4>they're hyper switched on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If anybody ever wanted to understand </v>

967
00:41:06.551 --> 00:41:10.030
<v Speaker 4>human biology,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like male versus female biology,</v>

968
00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:12.800
<v Speaker 4>they should see deer and elk in the Rut.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

969
00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:16.330
<v Speaker 4>To see animals in the Rut that normally </v>
<v Speaker 4>would be super spooky,</v>

970
00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:21.250
<v Speaker 4>afraid of everything jumping at every </v>
<v Speaker 4>snap twig and they just walking right up</v>

971
00:41:21.251 --> 00:41:22.084
<v Speaker 4>to people like they don't know what's </v>
<v Speaker 4>going on there in a horny for you get </v>

972
00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:27.063
<v Speaker 4>you ever see that video of the guy who </v>
<v Speaker 4>taps the deer on the antlers with as </v>

973
00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:32.350
<v Speaker 4>well as Arrow?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's got an arrow and this deer in front</v>

974
00:41:32.351 --> 00:41:33.800
<v Speaker 4>of him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just tapped on the antlers.</v>

975
00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:34.913
<v Speaker 3>The deer is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

976
00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:36.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I think that would ever happen.</v>

977
00:41:36.891 --> 00:41:39.170
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't right in the meeting season </v>
<v Speaker 3>once.</v>

978
00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:40.363
<v Speaker 3>Once they get those throbbing boners </v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't know what the fuck's going </v>

979
00:41:42.681 --> 00:41:43.760
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just wandering around.</v>

980
00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:46.310
<v Speaker 3>I saw an elk actually having sex this </v>
<v Speaker 3>year.</v>

981
00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:48.230
<v Speaker 3>You ever seen that in real life?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Up Close?</v>

982
00:41:48.231 --> 00:41:49.490
<v Speaker 3>Like not through binoculars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

983
00:41:49.491 --> 00:41:53.290
<v Speaker 3>So it was only like 30 yards and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>elk and they met.</v>

984
00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:56.780
<v Speaker 3>They get up in mount and then they go </v>
<v Speaker 3>back one big thrust.</v>

985
00:41:56.781 --> 00:41:57.561
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

986
00:41:57.561 --> 00:41:59.660
<v Speaker 3>that's how they get down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that's crazy.</v>

987
00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:03.170
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's literally like our double.</v>

988
00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:04.033
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he was so proud of himself and he </v>

989
00:42:05.781 --> 00:42:07.190
<v Speaker 3>got down and he was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>

990
00:42:07.191 --> 00:42:10.000
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Got that moved on.</v>

991
00:42:10.001 --> 00:42:14.350
<v Speaker 3>There was like 20 other 20 other </v>
<v Speaker 3>calories right there that he had the.</v>

992
00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:16.640
<v Speaker 3>He had the service.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's ridiculous.</v>

993
00:42:16.641 --> 00:42:17.870
<v Speaker 3>Just wandering around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

994
00:42:17.871 --> 00:42:21.740
<v Speaker 3>I saw it from about 60 yards out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It sounds crazy,</v>

995
00:42:21.741 --> 00:42:22.730
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

996
00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:23.623
<v Speaker 3>it's a fascinating experience to just to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be around them when they're behaving </v>

997
00:42:27.021 --> 00:42:27.854
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're screaming and yelling at each </v>

998
00:42:28.881 --> 00:42:31.040
<v Speaker 3>other and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and running and mating.</v>

999
00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:34.040
<v Speaker 3>It's because it only happens once a year</v>
<v Speaker 3>for those animals.</v>

1000
00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:34.830
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're gonna.</v>

1001
00:42:34.830 --> 00:42:36.790
<v Speaker 3>See it right here on top.</v>

1002
00:42:44.170 --> 00:42:47.570
<v Speaker 3>It's very climactic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would wonder how accurate it is.</v>

1003
00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:48.780
<v Speaker 3>It's got to be here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1004
00:42:48.790 --> 00:42:50.570
<v Speaker 3>I got to line it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1005
00:42:50.610 --> 00:42:52.010
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just didn't align in that up.</v>

1006
00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:55.130
<v Speaker 3>I guess he's lining it up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but does he really know what he's doing?</v>

1007
00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:58.700
<v Speaker 3>He only does it once every six months or</v>
<v Speaker 3>once every 11 months.</v>

1008
00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:01.670
<v Speaker 3>Let's be frustrating on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can see why they'll fight each other</v>

1009
00:43:01.671 --> 00:43:03.470
<v Speaker 3>for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They run for about a month,</v>

1010
00:43:03.471 --> 00:43:05.150
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1011
00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:08.810
<v Speaker 3>But how cool is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How one bowl,</v>

1012
00:43:09.290 --> 00:43:11.240
<v Speaker 3>if he's a bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a good fighter,</v>

1013
00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:17.230
<v Speaker 3>he can have like the first bull that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually arrowed with my bow,</v>

1014
00:43:18.050 --> 00:43:18.883
<v Speaker 3>he had a Harem of 45 cows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one bowl and there was like three </v>

1015
00:43:23.841 --> 00:43:24.674
<v Speaker 3>satellite bulls,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there was one bowl and he had 45 </v>

1016
00:43:27.501 --> 00:43:30.500
<v Speaker 3>cows with him that he was hurting that </v>
<v Speaker 3>were his girlfriends.</v>

1017
00:43:31.610 --> 00:43:33.050
<v Speaker 3>And they're all basically in heat.</v>

1018
00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:34.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they're,</v>

1019
00:43:34.191 --> 00:43:36.740
<v Speaker 3>they're like relying on him to service </v>
<v Speaker 3>all of them.</v>

1020
00:43:36.741 --> 00:43:38.600
<v Speaker 3>40th five cows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

1021
00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:39.493
<v Speaker 3>from what I hear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's places where it's like there's </v>

1022
00:43:40.911 --> 00:43:43.820
<v Speaker 3>like one bowl for 80 cows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

1023
00:43:44.210 --> 00:43:46.100
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot of work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot of work.</v>

1024
00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:49.160
<v Speaker 3>It's too exhausting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You really want like three.</v>

1025
00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:51.020
<v Speaker 3>That's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's like Dan Bilzerian,</v>

1026
00:43:54.210 --> 00:43:58.850
<v Speaker 3>he's like a human bowl boil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very similar isn't that is fucking logo.</v>

1027
00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:00.320
<v Speaker 3>Did you have him on your show?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1028
00:44:00.350 --> 00:44:00.970
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1029
00:44:00.970 --> 00:44:01.803
<v Speaker 3>So good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's always invited me to parties and </v>

1030
00:44:03.310 --> 00:44:04.130
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen man,</v>

1031
00:44:04.130 --> 00:44:06.950
<v Speaker 3>I'm married.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't go to your fucking pointless.</v>

1032
00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:10.730
<v Speaker 3>Pointless to go to a party of his.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're married.</v>

1033
00:44:10.790 --> 00:44:12.950
<v Speaker 3>I think his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his logo was a bowl.</v>

1034
00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:15.190
<v Speaker 3>Not a bull elk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a bowl because it go.</v>

1035
00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:17.360
<v Speaker 3>Is it a goat to go?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

1036
00:44:17.540 --> 00:44:18.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>

1037
00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:21.040
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it does it go.</v>

1038
00:44:21.060 --> 00:44:23.030
<v Speaker 3>It's like who's your move lawn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1039
00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:25.160
<v Speaker 3>That's what it looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I moved onto the sheet,</v>

1040
00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:27.290
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a goat I think.</v>

1041
00:44:27.990 --> 00:44:29.150
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

1042
00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:31.890
<v Speaker 3>so is a super random</v>

1043
00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:32.993
<v Speaker 1>who's the best podcast you've ever had?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time I think I have the best </v>

1044
00:44:38.191 --> 00:44:40.260
<v Speaker 1>podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll have another one that's better.</v>

1045
00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:41.513
<v Speaker 1>I talked to someone that I respect </v>
<v Speaker 1>recently and they said that the Elan </v>

1046
00:44:44.190 --> 00:44:47.400
<v Speaker 1>Musk one was the best podcast ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty damn good in history.</v>

1047
00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:49.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That one is wherever.</v>

1048
00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:51.600
<v Speaker 1>The best podcasts in history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a strong word.</v>

1049
00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:53.370
<v Speaker 1>Best podcasts ever been made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1050
00:44:53.610 --> 00:44:57.670
<v Speaker 1>he's such a unique mind mean he just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they just,</v>

1051
00:44:57.870 --> 00:45:00.900
<v Speaker 1>he just posted a video of one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>boring tunnels,</v>

1052
00:45:00.901 --> 00:45:04.340
<v Speaker 1>first a completed tunnels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the.</v>

1053
00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:05.850
<v Speaker 1>Let's see Jamie on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1054
00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:09.780
<v Speaker 1>it's an insanely long tunnel through La </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>

1055
00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:11.790
<v Speaker 1>they've been doing this only for a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>months,</v>

1056
00:45:12.150 --> 00:45:15.090
<v Speaker 1>but apparently in December they're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to start doing this.</v>

1057
00:45:15.091 --> 00:45:16.260
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look how long this is.</v>

1058
00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:21.630
<v Speaker 1>This is inside La.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is his actual completed real</v>

1059
00:45:21.631 --> 00:45:24.840
<v Speaker 1>tunnel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's underneath la right now.</v>

1060
00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:26.240
<v Speaker 1>Kay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can we talk about how there's no like,</v>

1061
00:45:26.570 --> 00:45:27.403
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a prototype that we heard about is </v>

1062
00:45:28.861 --> 00:45:30.440
<v Speaker 1>like all of a sudden he was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

1063
00:45:30.510 --> 00:45:32.460
<v Speaker 1>how do you get a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who owns the land underneath?</v>

1064
00:45:32.490 --> 00:45:33.323
<v Speaker 1>That's a real good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he understood what I was </v>

1065
00:45:34.951 --> 00:45:36.360
<v Speaker 1>asking when I asked him that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1066
00:45:36.361 --> 00:45:37.890
<v Speaker 1>how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you do this?</v>

1067
00:45:37.891 --> 00:45:38.724
<v Speaker 1>Like who do you ask to do this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like all of a sudden he called my </v>

1068
00:45:40.650 --> 00:45:41.483
<v Speaker 1>project manager.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like no shit house to make a well </v>

1069
00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:50.490
<v Speaker 1>and they want to dig under their house </v>
<v Speaker 1>to make a well and they'd go through the</v>

1070
00:45:50.491 --> 00:45:52.410
<v Speaker 1>roof of your tunnel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are they allowed to.</v>

1071
00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:53.543
<v Speaker 1>I love that there's humans like him that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are thinking on such a massive scale </v>

1072
00:45:57.780 --> 00:46:02.430
<v Speaker 1>that are trying to fix the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems that humans are facing.</v>

1073
00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:06.540
<v Speaker 1>Guys like you were out there riding </v>
<v Speaker 1>waves and I'm telling Dick Jokes.</v>

1074
00:46:06.990 --> 00:46:10.080
<v Speaker 1>This guy is digging holes under the </v>
<v Speaker 1>earth.</v>

1075
00:46:10.170 --> 00:46:11.003
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's also sending cars in the </v>

1076
00:46:14.971 --> 00:46:16.170
<v Speaker 1>space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1077
00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:18.540
<v Speaker 1>He sent his own car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He shot into space.</v>

1078
00:46:18.541 --> 00:46:21.570
<v Speaker 1>He's got space x.</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's talking about colonizing Mars,</v>

1079
00:46:22.110 --> 00:46:26.430
<v Speaker 1>he's got a Tesla company that makes the </v>
<v Speaker 1>best electric cars on the planet earth.</v>

1080
00:46:26.850 --> 00:46:27.683
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got so many different things going </v>

1081
00:46:28.771 --> 00:46:32.370
<v Speaker 1>on simultaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't understand his capacity for</v>

1082
00:46:32.371 --> 00:46:33.210
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's trying,</v>

1083
00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:36.410
<v Speaker 1>he's trying to fix the energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1084
00:46:36.450 --> 00:46:38.620
<v Speaker 1>the energy problem with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1085
00:46:39.270 --> 00:46:40.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting energy from,</v>

1086
00:46:40.970 --> 00:46:41.803
<v Speaker 1>from the sun to power your house to </v>
<v Speaker 1>power your car to power cities and you </v>

1087
00:46:45.751 --> 00:46:47.070
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>

1088
00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:47.933
<v Speaker 1>He makes solar panels now that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually tiles for your roof or your </v>

1089
00:46:51.780 --> 00:46:53.180
<v Speaker 1>solar roof.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Incredible.</v>

1090
00:46:53.330 --> 00:46:56.610
<v Speaker 1>Like you replaced the tiles on your roof</v>
<v Speaker 1>with these solar time.</v>

1091
00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:58.680
<v Speaker 1>Solar's fricking cool dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just got it on my house.</v>

1092
00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:01.680
<v Speaker 1>I got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got it on my house and it and have one</v>

1093
00:47:01.681 --> 00:47:02.514
<v Speaker 1>of those tests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the powerwall two batteries and things </v>

1094
00:47:04.171 --> 00:47:05.004
<v Speaker 1>insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's got like this crazy smart </v>

1095
00:47:06.541 --> 00:47:10.230
<v Speaker 1>algorithm that knows when a hurricane's </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming to Hawaii and it'll like power up</v>

1096
00:47:10.390 --> 00:47:12.300
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my battery deal 100 percent.</v>

1097
00:47:12.660 --> 00:47:13.493
<v Speaker 1>Even if I'm not home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if I'm not watching the weather </v>

1098
00:47:14.671 --> 00:47:16.710
<v Speaker 1>channel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just does it automatically because it</v>

1099
00:47:16.711 --> 00:47:18.910
<v Speaker 1>knows it might need to back up my house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>

1100
00:47:18.990 --> 00:47:19.561
<v Speaker 1>so my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>

1101
00:47:19.561 --> 00:47:23.190
<v Speaker 1>my elk doesn't go bad in my freezer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So are you on the grid?</v>

1102
00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:24.033
<v Speaker 1>Are you off the grid on the grid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have the solar power as well as </v>

1103
00:47:27.361 --> 00:47:30.070
<v Speaker 1>a backup power comes from</v>

1104
00:47:30.090 --> 00:47:30.923
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the solar and you could sell some of it </v>

1105
00:47:32.831 --> 00:47:34.630
<v Speaker 3>back to the grid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1106
00:47:34.631 --> 00:47:36.110
<v Speaker 3>mind you that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1107
00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:36.993
<v Speaker 3>they used to do that in Hawaii,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think they stopped in the power </v>

1108
00:47:39.041 --> 00:47:41.440
<v Speaker 3>companies weren't down with solar </v>
<v Speaker 3>really.</v>

1109
00:47:41.950 --> 00:47:42.783
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to establish solar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to get permits and everything </v>

1110
00:47:45.851 --> 00:47:47.220
<v Speaker 3>to have your house set up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they,</v>

1111
00:47:47.230 --> 00:47:48.880
<v Speaker 3>they try to make it kind of difficult </v>
<v Speaker 3>for it.</v>

1112
00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:50.620
<v Speaker 3>Try to make it very difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1113
00:47:50.621 --> 00:47:51.800
<v Speaker 3>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty cool.</v>

1114
00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:52.960
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've offset my,</v>

1115
00:47:52.990 --> 00:47:53.823
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my power needs with solar by like 80 </v>

1116
00:47:55.121 --> 00:47:56.460
<v Speaker 3>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow,</v>

1117
00:47:56.461 --> 00:47:57.294
<v Speaker 3>that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you could conceivably just exists </v>

1118
00:47:59.710 --> 00:48:01.120
<v Speaker 3>purely on solar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1119
00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:03.400
<v Speaker 3>Now you're on the big island.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

1120
00:48:03.650 --> 00:48:06.270
<v Speaker 3>No wild is fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Volcano Shit is going.</v>

1121
00:48:06.310 --> 00:48:08.680
<v Speaker 3>How's that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You freaking out about that at all?</v>

1122
00:48:09.430 --> 00:48:10.990
<v Speaker 3>Not freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was freaking out.</v>

1123
00:48:11.290 --> 00:48:12.123
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1124
00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:14.860
<v Speaker 3>so I live on the west side in Kona.</v>

1125
00:48:15.220 --> 00:48:19.240
<v Speaker 3>The volcanoes on the east side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So is the east side,</v>

1126
00:48:19.330 --> 00:48:21.610
<v Speaker 3>is that near?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just south of Hilo.</v>

1127
00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:23.890
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's where the,</v>

1128
00:48:24.210 --> 00:48:25.870
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's where the volcano was,</v>

1129
00:48:25.871 --> 00:48:29.410
<v Speaker 3>but the wind like the tradewinds blow </v>
<v Speaker 3>east to west.</v>

1130
00:48:29.590 --> 00:48:32.500
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So where I live,</v>

1131
00:48:32.970 --> 00:48:35.020
<v Speaker 3>it looked like Shanghai for like three </v>
<v Speaker 3>months.</v>

1132
00:48:35.790 --> 00:48:40.030
<v Speaker 3>The air sucked like crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like La smog times 10.</v>

1133
00:48:40.830 --> 00:48:44.000
<v Speaker 3>That freaked me out.</v>

<v Speaker 3>My daughter is severely allergic to </v>

1136
00:48:48.371 --> 00:48:49.204
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

1137
00:48:49.390 --> 00:48:51.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We went to a store on the big island.</v>

1138
00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:52.513
<v Speaker 3>We were staying at the four seasons and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we left and went down to a store to get </v>

1139
00:48:56.111 --> 00:48:56.944
<v Speaker 3>something for a cell phone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She came with me and she just starts </v>

1140
00:48:59.501 --> 00:49:02.410
<v Speaker 3>sneezing and sniffling and her eyes were</v>
<v Speaker 3>puffing up.</v>

1145
00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:07.320
<v Speaker 3>And the guy at the counter said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1146
00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:09.490
<v Speaker 3>it's probably the vog.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I live.</v>

1151
00:49:22.901 --> 00:49:24.350
<v Speaker 3>It's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1152
00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:26.440
<v Speaker 3>that's what it looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's insane.</v>

1153
00:49:26.500 --> 00:49:28.450
<v Speaker 3>That does look like it looks like </v>
<v Speaker 3>Beijing,</v>

1154
00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:29.800
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the crazy thing was,</v>

1155
00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:30.743
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if the,</v>

1156
00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:32.740
<v Speaker 3>if the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the wind goes the wrong way,</v>

1157
00:49:32.741 --> 00:49:36.930
<v Speaker 3>then like Maui Allahu,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all foggy,</v>

1158
00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:40.720
<v Speaker 3>like all throughout Hawaii.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it was basically like the whole,</v>

1159
00:49:40.730 --> 00:49:41.563
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the volcano essentially at a crazy </v>

1160
00:49:45.011 --> 00:49:46.510
<v Speaker 3>eruption for about three and a half </v>
<v Speaker 3>months.</v>

1161
00:49:46.860 --> 00:49:48.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then not digit stopped.</v>

1162
00:49:48.581 --> 00:49:50.560
<v Speaker 3>And the air quality is incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where I live now.</v>

1163
00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:51.490
<v Speaker 3>Real?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1164
00:49:51.490 --> 00:49:54.520
<v Speaker 3>Just so blue off blue skies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>crystal clear,</v>

1165
00:49:54.521 --> 00:49:56.410
<v Speaker 3>like just insane.</v>

1166
00:49:56.410 --> 00:49:57.690
<v Speaker 3>Sunset sunrises.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1167
00:49:58.360 --> 00:49:59.193
<v Speaker 3>it's just beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what did geologists best air quality </v>

1168
00:50:01.541 --> 00:50:03.340
<v Speaker 3>in 10 years for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1169
00:50:03.430 --> 00:50:04.263
<v Speaker 3>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know because there was like a </v>

1170
00:50:06.701 --> 00:50:11.110
<v Speaker 3>constant interruption for like 25 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was just kind of small,</v>

1171
00:50:11.111 --> 00:50:11.944
<v Speaker 3>but it was continuously going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But now it's like nearly shut down </v>

1172
00:50:15.371 --> 00:50:16.204
<v Speaker 3>completely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's hardly any kind of anything </v>

1173
00:50:17.531 --> 00:50:20.410
<v Speaker 3>going in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the volcano blew its load.</v>

1174
00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:22.780
<v Speaker 3>Did kinda like that elk?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1175
00:50:24.010 --> 00:50:24.721
<v Speaker 3>Bang.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was.</v>

1176
00:50:24.721 --> 00:50:25.554
<v Speaker 3>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was lining us up for awhile and just </v>

1177
00:50:26.930 --> 00:50:29.270
<v Speaker 3>big old bank.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the Vog is gone.</v>

1178
00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:31.130
<v Speaker 3>So now it's probably a good time to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1179
00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:32.750
<v Speaker 3>It's a very good time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1180
00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:34.640
<v Speaker 3>Come over and visit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does it fuck with the.</v>

1181
00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:37.400

<v Speaker 3>over and hunt.</v>

1182
00:50:38.100 --> 00:50:38.933

<v Speaker 3>I ain't getting hit in the head by a </v>

1183
00:50:40.191 --> 00:50:41.240
<v Speaker 3>giant chunk of lava.</v>

1184
00:50:43.130 --> 00:50:43.963
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

<v Speaker 3>had a big like a lava rock,</v>

1186
00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:51.050
<v Speaker 3>like a boulder lava boulder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And go through the roof of it.</v>

1187
00:50:51.110 --> 00:50:52.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's like a spectator boat.</v>

1188
00:50:52.910 --> 00:50:53.743
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were a tourist boat watching the </v>

1189
00:50:54.891 --> 00:50:57.230
<v Speaker 3>volcano psycho there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were so close.</v>

1190
00:50:57.360 --> 00:50:58.193
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you have a soda that Jamie that you </v>

1191
00:50:59.481 --> 00:51:00.770
<v Speaker 3>can bring up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's nuts.</v>

1192
00:51:01.330 --> 00:51:03.310
<v Speaker 3>These tour boat companies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they're.</v>

1193
00:51:03.350 --> 00:51:05.330
<v Speaker 3>They're pretty opportunistic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1194
00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:06.343
<v Speaker 3>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not easy to make a living on the </v>

1195
00:51:08.301 --> 00:51:09.134
<v Speaker 3>big island.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you get these people that all </v>

1196
00:51:10.491 --> 00:51:14.300
<v Speaker 3>want to go see the eruption.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That all the lava going into the water.</v>

1197
00:51:14.530 --> 00:51:15.363
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you can look for a photo of the boat </v>

1198
00:51:18.711 --> 00:51:19.544
<v Speaker 3>near the eruption,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some images of these boats that </v>

1199
00:51:22.341 --> 00:51:23.174
<v Speaker 3>were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it looked like they were like 50 feet </v>

1200
00:51:24.441 --> 00:51:27.170
<v Speaker 3>away from this mega eruption.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like crazy.</v>

1201
00:51:28.110 --> 00:51:28.943
<v Speaker 3>Really scary stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you don't have to mess with lava </v>

1202
00:51:30.501 --> 00:51:31.350
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1203
00:51:31.351 --> 00:51:32.184
<v Speaker 3>and especially when it's spitting things</v>
<v Speaker 3>out as the year before that watches </v>

1204
00:51:37.570 --> 00:51:39.810
<v Speaker 3>molten rock,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the earth pissed.</v>

1205
00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:43.980
<v Speaker 3>That's when it happened to veer off the </v>
<v Speaker 3>coast of Hawaii's big island.</v>

1206
00:51:43.981 --> 00:51:46.310
<v Speaker 3>Monday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well back then a buyer.</v>

<v Speaker 3>and hit them and I will think what would</v>

1208
00:51:49.861 --> 00:51:52.770
<v Speaker 3>I do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at it flying into the air.</v>

1209
00:51:54.490 --> 00:51:58.180
<v Speaker 3>The time to think about what you would </v>
<v Speaker 3>do is before you get on the boat.</v>

1210
00:51:58.450 --> 00:52:00.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once you're in that boat,</v>

1211
00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:01.780
<v Speaker 3>you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're just locked in.</v>

<v Speaker 3>you see the redness and the whole of the</v>

1214
00:52:08.081 --> 00:52:08.914
<v Speaker 3>boat.</v>

1217
00:52:16.690 --> 00:52:17.523

1218
00:52:19.211 --> 00:52:20.044
<v Speaker 3>get the closest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unobstructed view so everyone can take </v>

1302
00:55:57.961 --> 00:56:01.620
<v Speaker 1>And there was this one thing that I had </v>
<v Speaker 1>seen there that I'd never seen before.</v>

<v Speaker 3>it's so polite.</v>

1318
00:56:38.980 --> 00:56:39.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love Tokyo.</v>

1319
00:56:40.070 --> 00:56:40.903
<v Speaker 3>It's like everyone's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like you're visiting an </v>

1320
00:56:42.701 --> 00:56:44.530
<v Speaker 3>alien culture because I don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand.</v>

1321
00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:45.513
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what they're writing is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see it but I recognize it as Japanese </v>

1322
00:56:49.001 --> 00:56:51.760
<v Speaker 3>but I have no idea what it says.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the people there,</v>

1323
00:56:51.761 --> 00:56:56.050
<v Speaker 3>they're all like super polite and very </v>
<v Speaker 3>orderly and then everything's electronic</v>

1324
00:56:56.051 --> 00:56:57.910
<v Speaker 3>and it's almost like times square,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like with big,</v>

1325
00:56:58.210 --> 00:57:02.800
<v Speaker 3>like this is almost like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a parallel civilization.</v>

1326
00:57:02.860 --> 00:57:05.320
<v Speaker 3>Like on another planet and how the hell </v>
<v Speaker 3>they get there.</v>

1327
00:57:05.410 --> 00:57:06.243
<v Speaker 3>That's where they ended up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you look at the history of </v>

1328
00:57:07.451 --> 00:57:09.430
<v Speaker 3>Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the opposite of that.</v>

1329
00:57:09.890 --> 00:57:10.723
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Japan.</v>

1331
00:57:12.371 --> 00:57:16.330
<v Speaker 3>It's the opposite of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like all of a sudden they have like this</v>

1332
00:57:16.750 --> 00:57:18.790
<v Speaker 3>full on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like forward technology,</v>

1333
00:57:18.791 --> 00:57:22.060
<v Speaker 3>hyper futuristic civilization there now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1334
00:57:22.061 --> 00:57:24.160
<v Speaker 3>That's a fascinating thing about Asian </v>
<v Speaker 3>period,</v>

1335
00:57:24.161 --> 00:57:25.960
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Samsung in Korea,</v>

1336
00:57:25.961 --> 00:57:26.794
<v Speaker 3>they make the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of the best electronics in the </v>

1337
00:57:28.091 --> 00:57:28.924
<v Speaker 3>world and you drive just outside the </v>
<v Speaker 3>city and there's like rice fields </v>

1338
00:57:31.031 --> 00:57:31.970
<v Speaker 3>everywhere and people weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1339
00:57:32.500 --> 00:57:33.333
<v Speaker 3>working with those cool hats on and like</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone has no shoes and just on their </v>

1340
00:57:36.281 --> 00:57:37.114
<v Speaker 3>new mud.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you drive right to the city and </v>

1341
00:57:38.471 --> 00:57:40.720
<v Speaker 3>it's just like this giant electronic </v>
<v Speaker 3>city.</v>

1342
00:57:41.320 --> 00:57:42.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wonder what it is.</v>

1343
00:57:42.550 --> 00:57:43.383
<v Speaker 3>Kind of cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good food though in Japan and all over </v>

1344
00:57:45.010 --> 00:57:46.150
<v Speaker 3>Asia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I love Japan.</v>

1345
00:57:46.350 --> 00:57:47.370
<v Speaker 3>Dig It.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1346
00:57:47.500 --> 00:57:48.333
<v Speaker 3>Japan's pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just fascinated by the culture </v>

1347
00:57:50.441 --> 00:57:51.274
<v Speaker 3>period.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's obviously the birthplace </v>

1348
00:57:53.051 --> 00:57:54.340
<v Speaker 3>of a lot of martial arts.</v>

1349
00:57:54.670 --> 00:57:57.220
<v Speaker 3>Judo came from their karate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of.</v>

1350
00:57:57.420 --> 00:58:00.380
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of,</v>

1351
00:58:01.540 --> 00:58:02.373
<v Speaker 3>a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not the exact thing you want to be </v>

1352
00:58:06.790 --> 00:58:07.623
<v Speaker 3>spilling into the crack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was afraid that we're going to have </v>

1353
00:58:11.351 --> 00:58:12.184
<v Speaker 3>nothing to talk about that was going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be interesting or we get stuck on like </v>

1354
00:58:14.200 --> 00:58:16.840
<v Speaker 3>our tree for like two hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I looked up a couple of things.</v>

1355
00:58:17.640 --> 00:58:18.850
<v Speaker 3>What did you look up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was looking.</v>

1356
00:58:18.860 --> 00:58:19.693
<v Speaker 3>I was geeking out in the car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was that impressive when I just pulled </v>

1357
00:58:22.511 --> 00:58:25.390
<v Speaker 3>up in like a big Old Cadillac bug?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A black cadillac with a driver or what?</v>

1358
00:58:25.510 --> 00:58:26.343
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's normal.</v>

1359
00:58:27.340 --> 00:58:28.570
<v Speaker 3>Everybody does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was really,</v>

1360
00:58:28.750 --> 00:58:31.900
<v Speaker 3>really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Weird view because you live in Hawaii.</v>

01:05:57.041 --> 01:05:58.510
<v Speaker 3>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though I was born and raised on the</v>

1548
01:05:58.511 --> 01:05:59.344
<v Speaker 3>big island and every time I get off the </v>
<v Speaker 3>plane I just so baffling that freaking </v>

1549
01:06:03.910 --> 01:06:04.743
<v Speaker 3>lax airport and getting on the fricking </v>
<v Speaker 3>shuttle for the rental car and then </v>

1550
01:06:07.511 --> 01:06:08.880
<v Speaker 3>getting a rental car and then getting on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the four.</v>

<v Speaker 3>it's crazy.</v>

1553
01:06:13.150 --> 01:06:15.600
<v Speaker 3>There's always an adjustment period of </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a half an hour.</v>

1554
01:06:15.610 --> 01:06:17.560
<v Speaker 3>So when I'm driving I'm like in the slow</v>
<v Speaker 3>lane,</v>

1555
01:06:17.561 --> 01:06:18.394
<v Speaker 3>like why this is really happening 80 </v>
<v Speaker 3>miles an hour and then cost flyby going </v>

1556
01:06:21.970 --> 01:06:24.430
<v Speaker 3>80 miles an hour and everyone's going 80</v>
<v Speaker 3>and no one's getting stopped.</v>

1557
01:06:24.431 --> 01:06:26.470
<v Speaker 3>And I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just a shock.</v>

1558
01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:27.333
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're used to place where people don't </v>

1559
01:06:27.911 --> 01:06:29.860
<v Speaker 3>even pass people in the highway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1560
01:06:29.980 --> 01:06:32.410
<v Speaker 3>Lived on those roads.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If someone passes people in those little</v>

1561
01:06:32.411 --> 01:06:34.600
<v Speaker 3>single lane roads,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people get mad,</v>

<v Speaker 3>We get mad,</v>

1564
01:06:36.850 --> 01:06:39.680
<v Speaker 3>they get mad if you're going too fast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like slow down.</v>

1565
01:06:39.970 --> 01:06:41.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well the same,</v>

1566
01:06:41.231 --> 01:06:41.960
<v Speaker 3>the mainland.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

1567
01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:44.080
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's whole Hawaii is Hawaii.</v>

1568
01:06:44.110 --> 01:06:44.943
<v Speaker 3>Like I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we were talking about this on </v>

1569
01:06:47.081 --> 01:06:47.914
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the last,</v>

1570
01:06:47.990 --> 01:06:51.010
<v Speaker 3>last time I was here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Hawaii is just a,</v>

1571
01:06:51.100 --> 01:06:53.050
<v Speaker 3>it's a different kind of place where </v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1572
01:06:53.180 --> 01:06:54.013
<v Speaker 3>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't pass people just because </v>

1573
01:06:55.091 --> 01:06:58.110
<v Speaker 3>they're going a little bit slower on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1574
01:06:58.200 --> 01:06:59.033
<v Speaker 3>on the highway and if you do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you better make sure they're not the </v>

1575
01:07:00.011 --> 01:07:00.844
<v Speaker 3>wrong person.</v>

1576
01:07:01.270 --> 01:07:02.300
<v Speaker 3>They're gonna fuck you up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1577
01:07:02.301 --> 01:07:03.134
<v Speaker 3>You to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to show respect to the people </v>

1578
01:07:03.921 --> 01:07:04.930
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

1579
01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:05.440
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1580
01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:06.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's like a,</v>

1581
01:07:06.850 --> 01:07:08.380
<v Speaker 3>there's like this dynamic in Hawaii </v>
<v Speaker 3>where,</v>

1582
01:07:09.550 --> 01:07:11.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean everyone who moves there is,</v>

1583
01:07:11.910 --> 01:07:13.990
<v Speaker 3>that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think anyone gets mad at that,</v>

1584
01:07:13.991 --> 01:07:14.824
<v Speaker 3>but you just don't want those people to </v>
<v Speaker 3>move to Hawaii because they love Hawaii </v>

1585
01:07:18.201 --> 01:07:21.700
<v Speaker 3>and then try to turn it into California,</v>
<v Speaker 3>respect their culture,</v>

1586
01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:23.073
<v Speaker 3>the way people act and then respect the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the vibe that everything is more </v>

1587
01:07:26.801 --> 01:07:29.080
<v Speaker 3>relaxed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's why it's so cool to visit.</v>

1588
01:07:29.100 --> 01:07:29.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you,</v>

1589
01:07:29.890 --> 01:07:34.450
<v Speaker 3>you literally feel relaxed when you get </v>
<v Speaker 3>there because everything's relaxed.</v>

1590
01:07:34.451 --> 01:07:36.460
<v Speaker 3>It's a different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a different vibe.</v>

1591
01:07:36.700 --> 01:07:37.533
<v Speaker 3>People forget that though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People move to Hawaii for that and then </v>

1592
01:07:40.091 --> 01:07:41.860
<v Speaker 3>they moved to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Didn't want to turn it into California.</v>

1593
01:07:42.010 --> 01:07:42.843
<v Speaker 3>Does that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you want to buy a big house on the </v>

1594
01:07:43.601 --> 01:07:44.434
<v Speaker 3>beach and put a big wall around it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>keep everyone out of the private beach </v>

1595
01:07:46.901 --> 01:07:49.330
<v Speaker 3>and had like their own little zone and </v>
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

1596
01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:53.860
<v Speaker 3>this is my zone and my stuff and my </v>
<v Speaker 3>giant house and you'd actually go on the</v>

1597

<v Speaker 3>beach is kind of her hilarious.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Holding like a chunk of beach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you don't own that bitch.</v>

<v Speaker 3>like no,</v>

1613
01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:31.153

<v Speaker 4>you spend a lot of money on a house </v>

1622
01:08:55.310 --> 01:08:56.143

<v Speaker 4>that they've finally gotten to super </v>

1623
01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:03.200
<v Speaker 4>ultra rich category that the rules don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>apply anymore?</v>

1624
01:09:03.380 --> 01:09:05.010
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're just trying that.</v>

1625
01:09:05.020 --> 01:09:05.853
<v Speaker 4>I'm disgraced peaches,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mind they're trying to scare people off </v>

1626
01:09:08.241 --> 01:09:09.074
<v Speaker 4>of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they've hired a lot of security </v>

1627
01:09:09.801 --> 01:09:11.500
<v Speaker 4>guards.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See if you can find the article.</v>

1628
01:09:11.990 --> 01:09:12.823
<v Speaker 4>How miserable of those people imagine </v>
<v Speaker 4>being that person who's like yelling at </v>

1629
01:09:15.291 --> 01:09:17.180
<v Speaker 4>kids because they're in front on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>beach.</v>

1630
01:09:17.270 --> 01:09:18.103
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That guy is living in his own personal </v>

1631
01:09:19.131 --> 01:09:20.490
<v Speaker 4>hell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't care how rich it is.</v>

1632
01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:23.300
<v Speaker 4>It's just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just stupid.</v>

1633
01:09:23.630 --> 01:09:24.463
<v Speaker 4>Like if you live on the beach,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to kind of accept that your </v>

1634
01:09:27.621 --> 01:09:28.454
<v Speaker 4>house is next to this public park.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're essentially living in a public </v>

1635
01:09:33.261 --> 01:09:35.390
<v Speaker 4>park.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mean you have his dope view.</v>

1636
01:09:35.660 --> 01:09:38.240
<v Speaker 4>You get to look at the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's.</v>

1637
01:09:38.241 --> 01:09:39.074
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what's in front of your house is </v>

1638
01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:42.170
<v Speaker 4>everybody's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just is everybody's.</v>

1639
01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:43.633
<v Speaker 4>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't own it and it's never not </v>

1640
01:09:44.571 --> 01:09:46.190
<v Speaker 4>going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it moves.</v>

1641
01:09:46.191 --> 01:09:47.024
<v Speaker 4>It goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's one of the weird things that </v>

1642
01:09:47.631 --> 01:09:48.464
<v Speaker 4>happened.</v>

1643
01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:51.620
<v Speaker 4>Apparently they did something in Santa </v>
<v Speaker 4>Barbara.</v>

1644
01:09:51.980 --> 01:09:54.080
<v Speaker 4>They did something to the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the ocean.</v>

1645
01:09:54.081 --> 01:09:56.480
<v Speaker 4>They did something like they put up some</v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of a barrier,</v>

1646
01:09:56.630 --> 01:10:01.630
<v Speaker 4>some sort of break in Santa Barbara and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it affected broad beach in a crazy way,</v>

1647
01:10:02.571 --> 01:10:03.404
<v Speaker 4>like it pushed the water way closer </v>
<v Speaker 4>because one of the good things about </v>

1648
01:10:06.381 --> 01:10:07.214
<v Speaker 4>broad beach,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these I think they call a billionaire </v>

1649
01:10:08.481 --> 01:10:10.280
<v Speaker 4>beach,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was that these people,</v>

1650
01:10:10.281 --> 01:10:11.114
<v Speaker 4>these crazy fucking houses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they had this long stretch of sand </v>

1651
01:10:14.121 --> 01:10:18.950
<v Speaker 4>before the water and then the water came</v>
<v Speaker 4>way up to almost to where the houses are</v>

1652
01:10:18.951 --> 01:10:20.210
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's all gone,</v>

1653
01:10:20.450 --> 01:10:21.283
<v Speaker 4>but now the people that utilize the </v>
<v Speaker 4>beach are literally right from these </v>

1654
01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:26.930
<v Speaker 4>people's houses.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they're fucking freaking out crazy.</v>

1655
01:10:26.990 --> 01:10:28.940
<v Speaker 4>We've seen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is there any articles about.</v>

1656
01:10:28.970 --> 01:10:29.803
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so these people have hired security </v>

1657
01:10:31.701 --> 01:10:32.534
<v Speaker 4>guards to kick people off and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>people are getting together and these </v>

1658
01:10:35.271 --> 01:10:37.860
<v Speaker 4>lawsuits against these people that own </v>
<v Speaker 4>these houses.</v>

1659
01:10:37.860 --> 01:10:42.290
<v Speaker 4>So you can't keep us off the hatches and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never want to be those people dark.</v>

1660
01:10:42.380 --> 01:10:45.140
<v Speaker 4>Can we establish that and I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just want to keep those people here.</v>

1661
01:10:45.170 --> 01:10:46.003
<v Speaker 4>I just want to keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Surfing and bowling and how the </v>

1662
01:10:47.331 --> 01:10:48.164
<v Speaker 4>wealthier laying claim to the cow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to California's coast complaints have </v>

1663
01:10:50.871 --> 01:10:54.120
<v Speaker 4>been streaming about security guards,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1664
01:10:54.170 --> 01:10:57.800
<v Speaker 4>hired by wealthy homeowner homeowners,</v>
<v Speaker 4>removing people from public beaches.</v>

1665
01:10:57.830 --> 01:11:00.740
<v Speaker 4>You can't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those security guards,</v>

1666
01:11:00.980 --> 01:11:03.290
<v Speaker 4>they can't do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if they touched you,</v>

1667
01:11:03.770 --> 01:11:04.603
<v Speaker 4>like be assault.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you can't tell me I can't walk on </v>

1668
01:11:08.001 --> 01:11:09.110
<v Speaker 4>the beach.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't,</v>

1669
01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:11.390
<v Speaker 4>you can't do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was trying to read through this.</v>

1670
01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:13.980
<v Speaker 4>The first case says that security guard </v>
<v Speaker 4>went</v>

1671
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:14.813
<v Speaker 3>and got a sheriff and the sheriff told </v>
<v Speaker 3>them that they're going to get a ticket </v>

1672
01:11:16.441 --> 01:11:17.730
<v Speaker 3>if they didn't cut off the beach.</v>

1673
01:11:18.250 --> 01:11:21.480
<v Speaker 4>The sheriffs are all scared because </v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll,</v>

1674
01:11:21.481 --> 01:11:24.600
<v Speaker 4>all those people won the influence of </v>
<v Speaker 4>all these wealthy people.</v>

1675
01:11:24.870 --> 01:11:27.000
<v Speaker 4>The wealthy people influenced the </v>
<v Speaker 4>politicians.</v>

1676
01:11:27.001 --> 01:11:29.130
<v Speaker 4>The sheriff's want to keep their jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1677
01:11:29.131 --> 01:11:33.780
<v Speaker 4>the whole thing is just crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the thing is now today this stuff is</v>

1678
01:11:33.781 --> 01:11:34.614
<v Speaker 4>getting out and it's getting out on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Internet and it's getting out in these </v>

1679
01:11:37.651 --> 01:11:40.230
<v Speaker 4>stories and articles that are on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Internet.</v>

1680
01:11:40.450 --> 01:11:44.550
<v Speaker 4>Homeowners have employed several tactics</v>
<v Speaker 4>to keep their beach front properties.</v>

1681
01:11:44.551 --> 01:11:45.384
<v Speaker 4>Private.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Recent example of a case in Malibu and </v>

1682
01:11:47.031 --> 01:11:47.864
<v Speaker 4>vibe involved a property owner charging </v>
<v Speaker 4>people $40 to walk on the beach and </v>

1683
01:11:51.481 --> 01:11:52.314
<v Speaker 4>banning surfing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Unless the person was a resident or a </v>

1684
01:11:53.971 --> 01:11:54.840
<v Speaker 4>friend of a resident.</v>

1685
01:11:55.710 --> 01:11:58.550
<v Speaker 3>What you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't just decide.</v>

1686
01:11:58.850 --> 01:11:59.683
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's like literally going up to a </v>

1687
01:12:01.011 --> 01:12:03.620
<v Speaker 3>state park and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one can go in here.</v>

1688
01:12:03.650 --> 01:12:05.960
<v Speaker 3>It's too close to my house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1689
01:12:05.961 --> 01:12:08.730
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing right about that stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't get,</v>

1690
01:12:08.790 --> 01:12:12.410
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just hate that kind of right there.</v>

1691
01:12:12.411 --> 01:12:15.620
<v Speaker 3>That mentality that gives me the </v>
<v Speaker 3>gnarliest anxiety.</v>

1692
01:12:15.621 --> 01:12:17.570
<v Speaker 3>I just don't want to be anywhere near </v>
<v Speaker 3>those people.</v>

1693
01:12:17.860 --> 01:12:18.693
<v Speaker 3>I just want to get a far far away from </v>
<v Speaker 3>them and like live in the mountains in </v>

1694
01:12:20.721 --> 01:12:21.554
<v Speaker 3>Hawaii or.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do</v>

1695
01:12:21.890 --> 01:12:22.723
<v Speaker 4>look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She had been on the beach with just a </v>

1696
01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:26.180
<v Speaker 4>few minutes with a tall uniform security</v>
<v Speaker 4>guard approached.</v>

1697
01:12:26.390 --> 01:12:27.223
<v Speaker 4>He said he told Schwartz she was </v>
<v Speaker 4>trespassing on private property and </v>

1698
01:12:31.221 --> 01:12:34.250
<v Speaker 4>threatened her with a $1,500</v>
<v Speaker 4>fine and a court citation</v>

1699
01:12:34.260 --> 01:12:37.380
<v Speaker 3>if she didn't leave,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's an employee to have the uh,</v>

1700
01:12:38.690 --> 01:12:39.250
<v Speaker 3>mission,</v>

1701
01:12:39.250 --> 01:12:40.450
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>She said yeah,</v>

1702
01:12:40.451 --> 01:12:41.284
<v Speaker 4>she's a commissioned employee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was asked to do some reconnaissance </v>

1703
01:12:43.451 --> 01:12:47.470
<v Speaker 4>falling stream of formal complaints.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At that point I pulled out the maps that</v>

1704
01:12:47.471 --> 01:12:49.000
<v Speaker 4>I had and said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1705
01:12:49.001 --> 01:12:51.010
<v Speaker 4>this is a public area.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Swartz were called,</v>

1706
01:12:51.011 --> 01:12:51.844
<v Speaker 4>but the guard disregarded her insistence</v>
<v Speaker 4>after telling her she needed to provide </v>

1707
01:12:55.211 --> 01:12:56.830
<v Speaker 4>legal proof that she had a right to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

1708
01:12:56.831 --> 01:12:57.664
<v Speaker 4>The guard left and returned 20 minutes </v>
<v Speaker 4>later with two sheriff's deputies who </v>

1709
01:13:00.101 --> 01:13:00.934
<v Speaker 4>slipped swiftly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Advisor Schwartz at the beach was not </v>

1710
01:13:03.610 --> 01:13:06.550
<v Speaker 4>for public use.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then I got a bit unsettled.</v>

1711
01:13:06.551 --> 01:13:09.250
<v Speaker 4>She remembers as brave as I like to </v>
<v Speaker 4>think I am.</v>

1712
01:13:09.490 --> 01:13:12.280
<v Speaker 4>I kind of started shaking a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 4>and started to get a little nervous.</v>

1713
01:13:12.550 --> 01:13:13.420
<v Speaker 4>Did you read it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was,</v>

1714
01:13:13.421 --> 01:13:14.254
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1715
01:13:16.090 --> 01:13:17.170
<v Speaker 3>if you go back up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>

1716
01:13:17.171 --> 01:13:19.090
<v Speaker 3>it'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whose house that was?</v>

1717
01:13:19.150 --> 01:13:22.840
<v Speaker 3>I think it was David Geffen's daily that</v>
<v Speaker 3>happened also near his house.</v>

1718
01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:25.570
<v Speaker 3>Same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Deliberately restricted public access.</v>

1719
01:13:26.530 --> 01:13:29.920
<v Speaker 3>That same thing happen with Mark </v>
<v Speaker 3>Zuckerberg on quiet.</v>

1720
01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:30.953
<v Speaker 4>It's 2013.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Guardian reported how entertainment </v>

01:13:32.941 --> 01:13:35.150
<v Speaker 4>mogul David Geffen had deliberately </v>

<v Speaker 4>You can't do do</v>

1725
01:13:41.230 --> 01:13:42.070
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1726
01:13:42.071 --> 01:13:44.650
<v Speaker 3>Mark Zuckerberg did that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alkali real.</v>

1727
01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:45.513
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he bought up this beautiful property on </v>

1728
01:13:46.181 --> 01:13:48.340
<v Speaker 3>the north coast of Clive's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Incredible,</v>

1729
01:13:48.341 --> 01:13:49.174
<v Speaker 3>beautiful place with incredible waves </v>
<v Speaker 3>and not that many people live there and </v>

1730
01:13:51.971 --> 01:13:52.804
<v Speaker 3>he bought this insane like thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 3>acres right there when the most </v>

1731
01:13:55.631 --> 01:13:56.464
<v Speaker 3>beautiful places on earth and then try </v>
<v Speaker 3>to keep everybody out and like </v>

1732
01:13:59.170 --> 01:14:01.630
<v Speaker 3>completely blocked all the access and </v>
<v Speaker 3>all the Hawaiians,</v>

1733
01:14:01.631 --> 01:14:05.080
<v Speaker 3>all the local people got extremely angry</v>
<v Speaker 3>with him and if he just would have been.</v>

1734
01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:07.090
<v Speaker 3>I mean he.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's going to be a resident,</v>

1735
01:14:07.091 --> 01:14:09.220
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't think this little island on</v>

1736
01:14:09.260 --> 01:14:10.630
<v Speaker 3>coal eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People been living there.</v>

1737
01:14:11.620 --> 01:14:12.453
<v Speaker 3>You can't just like storm in there by </v>
<v Speaker 3>all the property up and block everyone </v>

1738
01:14:15.581 --> 01:14:18.190
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How you got to deliver and I don't know,</v>

1739
01:14:18.191 --> 01:14:21.600
<v Speaker 3>but is it like alumni sized or smaller?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Malott more than.</v>

1740
01:14:21.620 --> 01:14:22.453
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot more.</v>

1741
01:14:22.780 --> 01:14:24.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably be 40,000</v>

1742
01:14:24.851 --> 01:14:25.400
<v Speaker 3>or something like that.</v>

1743
01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:28.800
<v Speaker 3>Maybe 30,000,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

1744
01:14:28.900 --> 01:14:29.733
<v Speaker 3>the people on choir really territorial </v>
<v Speaker 3>and protective of where they live and </v>

1745
01:14:33.791 --> 01:14:34.624
<v Speaker 3>they live in a really beautiful place </v>
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of people who aren't from </v>

1746
01:14:37.751 --> 01:14:38.980
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have lots of money,</v>

1747
01:14:38.981 --> 01:14:40.570
<v Speaker 3>want to live there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

1748
01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:43.000
<v Speaker 3>people inquire hypersensitive to that </v>
<v Speaker 3>already.</v>

1749
01:14:43.390 --> 01:14:45.880
<v Speaker 3>So you got like Mark Zuckerberg,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1750
01:14:46.090 --> 01:14:47.620
<v Speaker 3>probably worth $80,000,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>or something.</v>

1751
01:14:47.621 --> 01:14:50.140
<v Speaker 3>Come in there and buy up all the land </v>
<v Speaker 3>and try and block everyone.</v>

1752
01:14:50.141 --> 01:14:53.470
<v Speaker 3>It's not a good move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>While he's probably a terrible move,</v>

1753
01:14:53.530 --> 01:14:56.080
<v Speaker 3>but he's probably super insulated to </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

1754
01:14:56.110 --> 01:14:57.940
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean everywhere that guy goes,</v>

1755
01:14:57.941 --> 01:15:00.180
<v Speaker 3>he brings security guards with them or </v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd have to.</v>

1756
01:15:00.370 --> 01:15:01.203
<v Speaker 3>And he's probably like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he probably has almost no interaction </v>

1757
01:15:04.750 --> 01:15:08.740
<v Speaker 3>with regular people you would think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So these young man so young,</v>

1758
01:15:08.890 --> 01:15:11.380
<v Speaker 3>he's like 34 some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How old is he,</v>

1759
01:15:11.381 --> 01:15:12.214
<v Speaker 3>Jamie?</v>

1760
01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:15.660
<v Speaker 3>What's your worth?</v>
<v Speaker 3>$80.</v>

1761
01:15:15.820 --> 01:15:18.490
<v Speaker 3>Billion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine being in your thirties and worth</v>

1762
01:15:18.491 --> 01:15:20.290
<v Speaker 3>$80,000,000,000.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Still working.</v>

1763
01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:21.910
<v Speaker 3>How about that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's cool though.</v>

1764
01:15:21.911 --> 01:15:23.860
<v Speaker 3>I love that about these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like um,</v>

1765
01:15:23.890 --> 01:15:25.610
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like Elon Musk and,</v>

1766
01:15:25.830 --> 01:15:27.580
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Zuckerberg,</v>

1767
01:15:27.581 --> 01:15:28.560
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's cool.</v>

1768
01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:31.540
<v Speaker 3>Those guys believe so much that they can</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually make a difference,</v>

1769
01:15:31.541 --> 01:15:32.374
<v Speaker 3>that they're still,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the only reason that's keeping </v>

1770
01:15:33.361 --> 01:15:35.900
<v Speaker 3>them where it's not the money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He paid $100,</v>

1771
01:15:35.910 --> 01:15:38.740
<v Speaker 3>million dollars to purchase 700 acres of</v>
<v Speaker 3>land.</v>

1772
01:15:38.830 --> 01:15:41.500
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's 34,</v>

1773
01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:43.630
<v Speaker 3>34.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

1774
01:15:43.750 --> 01:15:47.260
<v Speaker 3>Straight up bowling ball and out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Woo As balling.</v>

1775
01:15:47.770 --> 01:15:49.660
<v Speaker 3>There's a big difference in him and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Nealon Musto.</v>

1776
01:15:50.260 --> 01:15:51.093
<v Speaker 3>He's got a weird reputation of fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>over the people that he'd made made </v>

1777
01:15:54.101 --> 01:15:57.490
<v Speaker 3>facebook with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that's correct or not,</v>

1778
01:15:57.670 --> 01:15:58.810
<v Speaker 3>but that movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1779
01:15:58.811 --> 01:16:00.970
<v Speaker 3>I sue the fuck out of those people made </v>
<v Speaker 3>that movie.</v>

1780
01:16:01.290 --> 01:16:03.010
<v Speaker 3>If that's not true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right in the movie,</v>

1781
01:16:03.011 --> 01:16:04.870
<v Speaker 3>they kind of set it up like he stole the</v>
<v Speaker 3>idea.</v>

1782
01:16:04.900 --> 01:16:06.100
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had to settle.</v>

1783
01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:06.993
<v Speaker 3>He settled out of court.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Paid a lot of millions to like the </v>

1784
01:16:09.311 --> 01:16:11.630
<v Speaker 3>winklevoss brothers I think to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to uh,</v>

1785
01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:13.190
<v Speaker 3>because they said it was their idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1786
01:16:13.210 --> 01:16:15.200
<v Speaker 3>They made him look like a Dick in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>movie though.</v>

1787
01:16:16.090 --> 01:16:16.923
<v Speaker 3>They shared it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of heavy that that movie </v>

1788
01:16:18.341 --> 01:16:19.810
<v Speaker 3>actually got made.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would think that they would have got</v>

1789
01:16:19.811 --> 01:16:21.190
<v Speaker 3>paid off to not make it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1790
01:16:21.191 --> 01:16:22.930
<v Speaker 3>it's weird to make a movie about a </v>
<v Speaker 3>person,</v>

1791
01:16:24.070 --> 01:16:28.090
<v Speaker 3>even if they got accurate reports from </v>
<v Speaker 3>other people.</v>

1792
01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:28.953
<v Speaker 3>It's so weird to make a movie about a </v>
<v Speaker 3>person who's still alive right now and </v>

1793
01:16:31.861 --> 01:16:34.080
<v Speaker 3>put words in his mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Has a lot of it is speculation too,</v>

1794
01:16:34.130 --> 01:16:35.560
<v Speaker 3>no matter what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For sure.</v>

1795
01:16:35.660 --> 01:16:36.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Off Light.</v>

1796
01:16:37.300 --> 01:16:38.133
<v Speaker 3>It says that the settlement was $20,</v>
<v Speaker 3>million in cash and $45 million in </v>

1797
01:16:41.321 --> 01:16:44.740
<v Speaker 3>facebook stock price.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're worth billions.</v>

1798
01:16:44.790 --> 01:16:46.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he got off light.</v>

1799
01:16:46.420 --> 01:16:47.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If he did dick them over.</v>

1800
01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:51.090
<v Speaker 3>But who knows if they're telling the </v>
<v Speaker 3>truth version,</v>

1801
01:16:51.470 --> 01:16:53.530
<v Speaker 3>there's always.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's always two sides to every story,</v>

1802
01:16:53.540 --> 01:16:54.373
<v Speaker 3>but a movie about you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if somebody made a movie about you </v>

1803
01:16:56.920 --> 01:16:57.753
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had you on the beach saying some shit </v>

1804
01:16:59.021 --> 01:17:00.550
<v Speaker 3>you never really said like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

1805
01:17:00.940 --> 01:17:01.773
<v Speaker 3>I didn't say those words.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't have me say those words with </v>

1806
01:17:04.931 --> 01:17:09.931
<v Speaker 3>an actor's inflection and his decisions </v>
<v Speaker 3>to make whatever creative he makes with</v>

1807
01:17:10.130 --> 01:17:10.963
<v Speaker 1>the way he talks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Ninety nine percent of the people </v>

1808
01:17:13.131 --> 01:17:15.410
<v Speaker 1>watching that movie aren't having this </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation with people.</v>

1809
01:17:15.470 --> 01:17:17.450
<v Speaker 1>They just automatically think that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Zuckerberg,</v>

1810
01:17:17.540 --> 01:17:18.470
<v Speaker 1>that's what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dick,</v>

1811
01:17:18.471 --> 01:17:19.610
<v Speaker 1>he's a dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did that.</v>

1812
01:17:19.670 --> 01:17:21.350
<v Speaker 1>He did those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the perception.</v>

1813
01:17:21.620 --> 01:17:22.790
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1814
01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:24.680
<v Speaker 1>if like Jamie was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1815
01:17:24.860 --> 01:17:26.840
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just got fired by Joe.</v>

1816
01:17:26.900 --> 01:17:28.620
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

1817
01:17:29.110 --> 01:17:29.943
<v Speaker 1>Joe's Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe Tried to touch me this one day when </v>

1818
01:17:32.271 --> 01:17:35.540
<v Speaker 1>I was shooting the techno target target.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He tried to touch me.</v>

1819
01:17:35.810 --> 01:17:36.643
<v Speaker 1>Everyone had maybe believe Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if he was like a really </v>

1820
01:17:38.901 --> 01:17:40.040
<v Speaker 1>pretty girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1821
01:17:40.580 --> 01:17:43.620
<v Speaker 1>Jamie can be a pretty girl if he shaves </v>
<v Speaker 1>hair.</v>

1822
01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:44.553
<v Speaker 1>It goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried to stop it being God damn ad </v>

1823
01:17:46.311 --> 01:17:47.144
<v Speaker 1>blocker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did try to stop it being made </v>

1824
01:17:48.290 --> 01:17:49.140
<v Speaker 1>according to this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1825
01:17:49.810 --> 01:17:50.643
<v Speaker 1>Shin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would though would need to stop the </v>

1826
01:17:52.161 --> 01:17:53.900
<v Speaker 1>movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the social network for being made.</v>

1827
01:17:53.930 --> 01:17:56.680
<v Speaker 1>I was from those leaks on emails that </v>
<v Speaker 1>came out in that hacking thing.</v>

1828
01:17:56.710 --> 01:17:58.760
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course he did,</v>

1829
01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:01.610
<v Speaker 1>but I think he has a right to it </v>
<v Speaker 1>honestly.</v>

1830
01:18:01.630 --> 01:18:02.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing,</v>

1831
01:18:02.481 --> 01:18:06.550
<v Speaker 1>pretty heavy that someone can make a </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie about you without your consent and</v>

1832
01:18:06.620 --> 01:18:08.930
<v Speaker 1>put words in your mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be the thing.</v>

1833
01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:12.380
<v Speaker 1>It'd be one thing if you were convicted </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a court of law for that stuff,</v>

1834
01:18:12.410 --> 01:18:14.090
<v Speaker 1>but if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if this is just like,</v>

1835
01:18:14.091 --> 01:18:15.620
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I swear this happened.</v>

1836
01:18:15.970 --> 01:18:17.360
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing though,</v>

1837
01:18:17.390 --> 01:18:20.390
<v Speaker 1>it's one thing if there's a documentary </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the documentary,</v>

1838
01:18:20.391 --> 01:18:21.224
<v Speaker 1>they're showing footage where Zuckerberg</v>
<v Speaker 1>is doing certain things and saying </v>

1839
01:18:23.330 --> 01:18:25.670
<v Speaker 1>certain things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a total different situation.</v>

1840
01:18:25.671 --> 01:18:26.504
<v Speaker 1>If you decide to put words in that guy's</v>
<v Speaker 1>mouth and you have fucking Justin </v>

1841
01:18:31.071 --> 01:18:34.610
<v Speaker 1>timberlake plan in a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who Played Him in the movie?</v>

1842
01:18:36.710 --> 01:18:38.450
<v Speaker 1>I think it was justin timberlake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it Justin Trudeau?</v>

1843
01:18:38.610 --> 01:18:39.443
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's in it.</v>

1844
01:18:40.940 --> 01:18:44.150
<v Speaker 1>Jesse Eisenberg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have a famous actor.</v>

1845
01:18:44.300 --> 01:18:48.020
<v Speaker 1>The famous actor plays you in a movie </v>
<v Speaker 1>and makes you out to be a con.</v>

1846
01:18:48.110 --> 01:18:49.610
<v Speaker 1>That sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's his choice.</v>

1847
01:18:49.710 --> 01:18:52.240
<v Speaker 1>He sucks and then the director is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make it a little more country.</v>

1848
01:18:52.390 --> 01:18:53.410
<v Speaker 1>Can you do a little more contained?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1849
01:18:53.450 --> 01:18:55.490
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll go a little more of a dick.</v>

1850
01:18:55.590 --> 01:18:58.550
<v Speaker 1>I'll be a little more removed here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll try a little more removed.</v>

1851
01:18:58.551 --> 01:18:59.810
<v Speaker 1>This next take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1852
01:19:00.040 --> 01:19:02.180
<v Speaker 1>It's like you can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should.</v>

1853
01:19:02.750 --> 01:19:03.583
<v Speaker 1>You should be able to sue the fuck out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of those people because at the end of </v>

1854
01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:08.030
<v Speaker 1>the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one thing to tell a story.</v>

1855
01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:10.010
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I worked with Zuckerberg.</v>

1856
01:19:10.070 --> 01:19:11.870
<v Speaker 1>That guy was a dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He stole my ideas.</v>

1857
01:19:11.990 --> 01:19:12.823
<v Speaker 1>It's another thing to have someone play </v>
<v Speaker 1>him in a movie and make up a bunch of </v>

1858
01:19:16.581 --> 01:19:19.250
<v Speaker 1>words that he didn't really say or you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know.</v>

1859
01:19:19.250 --> 01:19:20.100
<v Speaker 1>He really said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1860
01:19:20.101 --> 01:19:20.934
<v Speaker 1>you don't have any proof that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He really said that's a fucking snitch </v>

1861
01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:23.873
<v Speaker 1>range.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I've always felt that way about </v>

1862
01:19:26.181 --> 01:19:27.014
<v Speaker 1>historical movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they make a movie about Abraham </v>

1863
01:19:29.210 --> 01:19:30.200
<v Speaker 1>Lincoln.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like someone was saying,</v>

1864
01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:32.960
<v Speaker 1>how the fuck did they do a movie?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Abraham Lincoln,</v>

1865
01:19:33.170 --> 01:19:34.850
<v Speaker 1>vampire killer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1866
01:19:35.080 --> 01:19:36.100
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's too heavy.</v>

1867
01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:39.050
<v Speaker 1>It was really ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Abraham Lincoln was killer.</v>

1868
01:19:39.290 --> 01:19:42.560
<v Speaker 1>Was one of the dumbest movies ever take </v>
<v Speaker 1>to make it east killing vampires.</v>

1869
01:19:42.561 --> 01:19:44.750
<v Speaker 1>I think with an ax,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think he killed them with an ax.</v>

1870
01:19:45.020 --> 01:19:47.270
<v Speaker 1>It was really stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was saying,</v>

1871
01:19:47.271 --> 01:19:48.200
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's dumb,</v>

1872
01:19:48.350 --> 01:19:51.290
<v Speaker 1>but is it any dumber than any other </v>
<v Speaker 1>Abraham Lincoln movie?</v>

1873
01:19:51.410 --> 01:19:54.140
<v Speaker 1>You have a bunch of movies about Abraham</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lincoln where he's just hanging out with</v>

1874
01:19:54.141 --> 01:19:55.880
<v Speaker 1>his kids and talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what the fuck.</v>

1875
01:19:55.881 --> 01:19:56.714
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what kind of interaction </v>

1876
01:19:58.701 --> 01:20:00.800
<v Speaker 1>he actually had with his wife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You weren't there.</v>

1877
01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:05.450
<v Speaker 1>How do you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you pitch that movie to a studio?</v>

1878
01:20:05.930 --> 01:20:06.591
<v Speaker 1>You know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys?</v>

1879
01:20:06.591 --> 01:20:08.340
<v Speaker 1>I got this concept,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got this concept.</v>

1880
01:20:08.700 --> 01:20:09.533
<v Speaker 1>That's when you know you've got way too </v>
<v Speaker 1>much money is when you're making movies </v>

1881
01:20:10.981 --> 01:20:13.320
<v Speaker 1>about Abraham Lincoln and being a </v>
<v Speaker 1>vampire killer.</v>

1882
01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:14.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pull up.</v>

1883
01:20:14.100 --> 01:20:16.740
<v Speaker 1>Pull up the trailer for Abraham Lincoln,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vampire slayer.</v>

1884
01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:19.920
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to remember if I remember </v>
<v Speaker 1>correctly though.</v>

1885
01:20:19.921 --> 01:20:20.754
<v Speaker 1>This came at a time to the guy that </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote the book that this movie was made </v>

1886
01:20:23.371 --> 01:20:27.720
<v Speaker 1>from wrote pride and pride,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pride and prejudice and zombies were.</v>

1887
01:20:27.721 --> 01:20:29.400
<v Speaker 1>He rewrote pro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>excuse me,</v>

1888
01:20:29.401 --> 01:20:30.234
<v Speaker 1>pride and browse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but added a zombie like plot throughout </v>

1889
01:20:33.781 --> 01:20:36.030
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we had to say he mashed up the story.</v>

1890
01:20:36.330 --> 01:20:38.850
<v Speaker 1>It was successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he did it again with like an amber,</v>

1891
01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:41.820
<v Speaker 1>Abraham Lincoln,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a biography,</v>

1892
01:20:41.850 --> 01:20:42.683
<v Speaker 1>but added vampires to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there demand and it went and the </v>

1893
01:20:45.070 --> 01:20:48.300
<v Speaker 1>demand that is there enough people on </v>
<v Speaker 1>earth that wants to watch shit movies?</v>

1936
01:22:56.551 --> 01:22:59.220
<v Speaker 1>Lewis Lincoln movie was kind of dull to </v>
<v Speaker 1>slow.</v>

1937
01:22:59.300 --> 01:23:00.133
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>There's a few people that a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are actors that are just </v>

1949
01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:31.540
<v Speaker 1>Weirdos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just these really strange people</v>

1950
01:23:31.541 --> 01:23:32.374
<v Speaker 1>that desperately want attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They figured out a way to use their </v>

1951
01:23:34.211 --> 01:23:37.870
<v Speaker 1>mental illness to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to navigate the waters of Hollywood.</v>

1952
01:23:37.870 --> 01:23:41.530
<v Speaker 1>In some strange way where their virtue </v>
<v Speaker 1>signaling and and,</v>

1953
01:23:41.531 --> 01:23:42.364
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and behaving exactly the way Hollywood </v>

1954
01:23:44.051 --> 01:23:48.280
<v Speaker 1>wants them to behave to get themselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>into these positions of fame,</v>

1955
01:23:48.281 --> 01:23:51.790
<v Speaker 1>and then they become movie stars and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they say a bunch of nonsense and these,</v>

1956
01:23:52.030 --> 01:23:54.340
<v Speaker 1>you hear them interviewed you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're not even a person.</v>

1957
01:23:54.730 --> 01:23:55.890
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not a person.</v>

1958
01:23:55.920 --> 01:23:58.030
<v Speaker 1>It's not a person talking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no sincerity,</v>

1959
01:23:58.180 --> 01:23:59.013
<v Speaker 1>there's no reality to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just painfully aware of every word </v>

1960
01:24:02.290 --> 01:24:04.270
<v Speaker 1>you're saying and how people going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>perceive it.</v>

1961
01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:08.740
<v Speaker 1>And you just know there's no Ouzo your </v>
<v Speaker 1>guards never down.</v>

1962
01:24:08.950 --> 01:24:09.783
<v Speaker 1>They're just Weirdos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's people like Daniel Day </v>

1963
01:24:12.430 --> 01:24:16.420
<v Speaker 1>Lewis who is just this savage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just figures out how to become these</v>

1964
01:24:16.850 --> 01:24:18.940
<v Speaker 1>real deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1979
01:24:45.130 --> 01:24:46.360

<v Speaker 1>I should.</v>

1980
01:24:46.510 --> 01:24:47.343
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if you make shoes for people </v>

<v Speaker 1>but like what does he do at these God </v>

1984
01:24:57.520 --> 01:24:59.170
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>After all that like,</v>

1985
01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:00.673
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was saying like all those crazy </v>

1986
01:25:01.211 --> 01:25:03.520
<v Speaker 1>moments I got human potential like you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1987
01:25:03.580 --> 01:25:04.413
<v Speaker 1>his human potential of his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like acting craft like during like last </v>

1988
01:25:07.211 --> 01:25:08.630
<v Speaker 1>Mohicans and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

1989
01:25:08.650 --> 01:25:12.160
<v Speaker 1>gangs in New York and stuff like going </v>
<v Speaker 1>from that like extreme,</v>

1990
01:25:12.161 --> 01:25:16.780
<v Speaker 1>those extreme highs and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>know performance levels to making shoes.</v>

1991
01:25:16.780 --> 01:25:20.170
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Usually people go up not,</v>

1992
01:25:20.290 --> 01:25:21.220
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1993
01:25:21.370 --> 01:25:23.820
<v Speaker 1>up in intensity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not down intensity.</v>

1994
01:25:23.860 --> 01:25:24.693
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1995
01:25:24.750 --> 01:25:25.583
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The intensity aspect of it is really </v>

1996
01:25:26.711 --> 01:25:28.000
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think for him,</v>

1997
01:25:28.090 --> 01:25:28.923
<v Speaker 1>like he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's such an artist that I don't think </v>

1998
01:25:31.541 --> 01:25:34.060
<v Speaker 1>he cares whether or not people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at his art.</v>

1999
01:25:34.300 --> 01:25:37.060
<v Speaker 1>I think he cares about the process of </v>
<v Speaker 1>creating.</v>

2000
01:25:37.410 --> 01:25:39.220
<v Speaker 1>So I think the same to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2001
01:25:39.430 --> 01:25:42.640
<v Speaker 1>I think the process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well maybe even more pure because of the</v>

2002
01:25:42.641 --> 01:25:45.160
<v Speaker 1>fact that it doesn't have any adulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no.</v>

2003
01:25:45.161 --> 01:25:47.890
<v Speaker 1>There's no spotlight on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no publicity team.</v>

2004
01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:50.020
<v Speaker 1>There's no stupid interviews he asked to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

2005
01:25:50.770 --> 01:25:51.480
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2006
01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:52.313
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that stuff must be maddening for him to </v>

2007
01:25:54.251 --> 01:25:56.800
<v Speaker 1>sit down with someone from fucking e </v>
<v Speaker 1>entertainment television.</v>

2008
01:25:56.920 --> 01:25:58.810
<v Speaker 1>So mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got another dope movie coming out.</v>

2009
01:25:59.020 --> 01:25:59.853
<v Speaker 1>Tell us about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like you need a Daniel Day </v>

2010
01:26:02.500 --> 01:26:04.100
<v Speaker 1>Lewis on the podcast here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd</v>

2011
01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:06.600
<v Speaker 3>be freaking amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but maybe he would have.</v>

2012
01:26:06.610 --> 01:26:07.940
<v Speaker 3>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That'd be to talk about shoes.</v>

2013
01:26:07.941 --> 01:26:08.774
<v Speaker 3>You probably be cycling on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I will talk to that guy for three </v>

2014
01:26:12.171 --> 01:26:14.320
<v Speaker 3>hours just about shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If he was into.</v>

2015
01:26:14.390 --> 01:26:16.070
<v Speaker 3>Just tell me about your stitching </v>
<v Speaker 3>process.</v>

2016
01:26:16.570 --> 01:26:18.920
<v Speaker 3>Like what do you choose your leather?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think,</v>

2017
01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:21.110
<v Speaker 3>from what I just read,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that he does it.</v>

2018
01:26:21.111 --> 01:26:21.944
<v Speaker 3>It says that he took time off from </v>
<v Speaker 3>making movies to study under this very </v>

2019
01:26:25.341 --> 01:26:29.110
<v Speaker 3>well known shoemaker for 10 months </v>
<v Speaker 3>specifically and only did thou.</v>

2020
01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:30.313
<v Speaker 3>Then he came back though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He made a movie like last year called </v>

2021
01:26:31.611 --> 01:26:32.720
<v Speaker 3>the phantom thread,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which were,</v>

2022
01:26:32.721 --> 01:26:34.670
<v Speaker 3>he was a designer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a fashion designer,</v>

2023
01:26:35.060 --> 01:26:36.520
<v Speaker 3>and then he learned to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2024
01:26:36.860 --> 01:26:39.570
<v Speaker 3>in order to do that he reverse </v>
<v Speaker 3>engineered a Valencia,</v>

2025
01:26:39.571 --> 01:26:44.320
<v Speaker 3>Aka dress and to just to learn how to </v>
<v Speaker 3>become a fashion Jaga dressed.</v>

2026
01:26:44.321 --> 01:26:44.820
<v Speaker 3>You know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we,</v>

2027
01:26:44.820 --> 01:26:47.150
<v Speaker 3>we pulled up at the blend stock as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>company.</v>

2028
01:26:47.550 --> 01:26:50.190
<v Speaker 3>It's that they make that shirt we made,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we put up a few weeks ago,</v>

2029
01:26:50.191 --> 01:26:52.340
<v Speaker 3>he doubles shirt thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's a high end,</v>

2030
01:26:52.341 --> 01:26:53.910
<v Speaker 3>very high end stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2031
01:26:54.500 --> 01:26:55.333
<v Speaker 3>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then put it back together again so </v>

2032
01:26:57.591 --> 01:26:59.270
<v Speaker 3>he could understand the process of doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2033
01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:01.940
<v Speaker 3>That was like his for us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how he became it,</v>

2034
01:27:02.510 --> 01:27:04.610
<v Speaker 3>got into character for the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for that movie.</v>

2035
01:27:04.790 --> 01:27:06.410
<v Speaker 3>So I don't know if he's retired all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

2036
01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:07.633
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't seem like he makes a believer</v>
<v Speaker 3>he retired and when he made that movie </v>

2037
01:27:10.521 --> 01:27:13.070
<v Speaker 3>last year though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>since 2017 for a while,</v>

2038
01:27:13.071 --> 01:27:14.690
<v Speaker 3>he likes six.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's only one way to find out.</v>

2039
01:27:14.700 --> 01:27:17.670
<v Speaker 3>He did retire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It took some time off as Daniel.</v>

2040
01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:20.630
<v Speaker 3>If you're out there anytime to just </v>
<v Speaker 3>Holler at me.</v>

2041
01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:22.310
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know you don't have a dog,</v>

2042
01:27:22.620 --> 01:27:24.440
<v Speaker 3>but I know you don't have a twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I got people.</v>

2043
01:27:24.441 --> 01:27:25.274
<v Speaker 3>You got people.</v>

2044
01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:29.890
<v Speaker 4>He was amazing in the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The boxer two,</v>

2045
01:27:30.040 --> 01:27:31.000
<v Speaker 4>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he did.</v>

2046
01:27:31.270 --> 01:27:32.103
<v Speaker 4>He played the most believable </v>
<v Speaker 4>professional boxer in a film because a </v>

2047
01:27:37.781 --> 01:27:42.781
<v Speaker 4>lot of films like even like the movie </v>
<v Speaker 4>with Marky mark where he played,</v>

2048
01:27:42.941 --> 01:27:44.410
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>micky ward.</v>

2049
01:27:45.250 --> 01:27:47.800
<v Speaker 4>It was like Mark Walberg knows how to </v>
<v Speaker 4>punch.</v>

2050
01:27:47.801 --> 01:27:48.634
<v Speaker 4>He knows how to throw punches,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's a difference between </v>

2051
01:27:50.890 --> 01:27:54.340
<v Speaker 4>throwing punches in a movie and a guy </v>
<v Speaker 4>throwing punches in a fight.</v>

2052
01:27:54.760 --> 01:27:55.593
<v Speaker 4>And if you look at the way Daniel Day </v>
<v Speaker 4>Lewis is performing in that boxing </v>

2053
01:27:59.321 --> 01:28:00.154
<v Speaker 4>movie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he looks like a guy who's throwing </v>

2054
01:28:02.081 --> 01:28:04.540
<v Speaker 4>punches in a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's way more realistic.</v>

2055
01:28:04.780 --> 01:28:05.613
<v Speaker 4>Any boxing movie I've ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he boxed for a full year before we </v>

2056
01:28:08.891 --> 01:28:12.400
<v Speaker 4>did that movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You mean just lived in a boxing gym.</v>

2057
01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:14.650
<v Speaker 4>He trained all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sparred,</v>

2058
01:28:14.860 --> 01:28:17.350
<v Speaker 4>hit the pads.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He got real coaching from.</v>

2059
01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:18.333
<v Speaker 4>He played a guy who is an Ira guy who </v>
<v Speaker 4>got out of jail and then got back into </v>

2060
01:28:22.391 --> 01:28:24.430
<v Speaker 4>boxing and then there's a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 4>terrorists,</v>

2061
01:28:24.431 --> 01:28:26.890
<v Speaker 4>shit involved in the film's very good </v>
<v Speaker 4>movie,</v>

2062
01:28:27.310 --> 01:28:29.770
<v Speaker 4>but see if you can find footage of him </v>
<v Speaker 4>from that movie.</v>

2063
01:28:30.540 --> 01:28:33.280
<v Speaker 4>So when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you see boxing movies,</v>

2064
01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:36.100
<v Speaker 4>guys are throwing punches like they know</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not going to get hit back.</v>

2065
01:28:36.460 --> 01:28:38.470
<v Speaker 4>Like this is a certain thing about </v>
<v Speaker 4>boxing.</v>

2066
01:28:38.710 --> 01:28:40.510
<v Speaker 4>Like if you watch a guy actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>fighting,</v>

2067
01:28:40.630 --> 01:28:41.463
<v Speaker 4>there's a tension,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a tension to worry about her </v>

2068
01:28:43.580 --> 01:28:46.230
<v Speaker 4>getting hit back and you see a movie </v>
<v Speaker 4>about a boxer goes like,</v>

2069
01:28:46.231 --> 01:28:49.210
<v Speaker 4>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just too much.</v>

2070
01:28:49.250 --> 01:28:51.580
<v Speaker 4>The myths are down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their chins out.</v>

2071
01:28:51.910 --> 01:28:54.430
<v Speaker 4>It's not just that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like the way they're moving.</v>

2072
01:28:54.431 --> 01:28:58.000
<v Speaker 4>There's no anticipation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no offense.</v>

2073
01:28:58.001 --> 01:29:00.850
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even when they're getting hit,</v>

2074
01:29:00.851 --> 01:29:02.130
<v Speaker 4>it's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's</v>

2075
01:29:02.130 --> 01:29:06.870
<v Speaker 1>like you can tell it makes it drives me </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy to watch him in here.</v>

2076
01:29:07.770 --> 01:29:08.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy,</v>

2077
01:29:08.900 --> 01:29:10.710
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he studied and trained,</v>

2078
01:29:10.770 --> 01:29:12.260
<v Speaker 1>I forget who was training,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2079
01:29:12.270 --> 01:29:16.020
<v Speaker 1>but it was like legit professional </v>
<v Speaker 1>boxers see crazy.</v>

2080
01:29:16.021 --> 01:29:16.854
<v Speaker 1>That commitment that these guys do to </v>
<v Speaker 1>take their acting to the next level </v>

2081
01:29:20.220 --> 01:29:21.053
<v Speaker 1>because it's like there's not that many </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who have noticed that he fights </v>

2082
01:29:23.761 --> 01:29:25.410
<v Speaker 1>more like a real fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

2083
01:29:25.740 --> 01:29:26.431
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not.</v>

2084
01:29:26.431 --> 01:29:27.264
<v Speaker 1>But even like see like other ways </v>
<v Speaker 1>throwing these punches like this is the </v>

2085
01:29:29.341 --> 01:29:33.120
<v Speaker 1>way a real boxer throws punches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they're not wide.</v>

2086
01:29:33.510 --> 01:29:37.520
<v Speaker 1>Everything's real tight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty fucking impressive.</v>

2087
01:29:38.210 --> 01:29:40.850
<v Speaker 1>But I mean I would expect nothing else </v>
<v Speaker 1>from this guy.</v>

2088
01:29:41.790 --> 01:29:42.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's legit.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Columbus,</v>

2128
01:31:18.620 --> 01:31:22.440
<v Speaker 1>the Shit I'm a big fan of Cleveland to,</v>

2130
01:31:24.860 --> 01:31:26.620
<v Speaker 1>Just for whatever font,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I.</v>

2131
01:31:26.640 --> 01:31:29.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm guessing it's foreign lands flat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that right?</v>

2132
01:31:29.640 --> 01:31:33.120
<v Speaker 1>Not Flat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the misinterpretations.</v>

2133
01:31:33.510 --> 01:31:34.343
<v Speaker 1>It's flatter than most areas for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like especially down from Columbus </v>

2134
01:31:37.351 --> 01:31:39.600
<v Speaker 1>down to the South area where the rivers </v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

2135
01:31:39.601 --> 01:31:40.434
<v Speaker 1>there's a spa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's Indian mounds and there's all </v>

2136
01:31:42.391 --> 01:31:45.510
<v Speaker 1>sorts of a glacier cut out spaces.</v>

2137
01:31:45.690 --> 01:31:46.523

<v Speaker 1>the hocking hills is a very cool spot </v>

2138
01:31:47.631 --> 01:31:50.670
<v Speaker 1>and there's also this old man's cave is </v>
<v Speaker 1>a really cool spot to.</v>

2139
01:31:51.120 --> 01:31:51.953
<v Speaker 1>It's like a traditional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Columbus is one of the most </v>

2140
01:31:53.971 --> 01:31:56.040
<v Speaker 1>underrated cities in the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2141
01:31:56.100 --> 01:31:57.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People don't think about it as it's like</v>

2142
01:31:57.811 --> 01:32:02.270
<v Speaker 1>the people are fucking cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a really good place to stand up for</v>

2143
01:32:02.271 --> 01:32:04.540
<v Speaker 1>stand up comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the best places in the world.</v>

2144
01:32:04.990 --> 01:32:07.300
<v Speaker 1>It's just fucking phenomenal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're smart,</v>

2145
01:32:07.630 --> 01:32:09.880
<v Speaker 1>but they're also like midwest type </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

2146
01:32:09.940 --> 01:32:10.900

2186
01:33:38.531 --> 01:33:39.364
<v Speaker 1>really warm clothes for hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might want to get one of those </v>

2187
01:33:41.170 --> 01:33:44.530
<v Speaker 1>thermal fucking things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen the heated sleeping bags?</v>

2188
01:33:44.950 --> 01:33:46.000
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are dope.</v>

2189
01:33:46.030 --> 01:33:47.950
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could wear one of those up there.</v>

2190
01:33:48.580 --> 01:33:49.510
<v Speaker 1>I could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2191
01:33:49.570 --> 01:33:51.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have those things.</v>

2192
01:33:51.401 --> 01:33:54.970
<v Speaker 1>What are they called in inferno suits or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

2193
01:33:54.971 --> 01:33:56.470
<v Speaker 1>What are those things called?</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

2194
01:33:56.471 --> 01:33:58.210
<v Speaker 1>the thing is I like.</v>

2195
01:33:58.510 --> 01:34:00.520
<v Speaker 1>I like hunting and cold weather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>

2196
01:34:00.580 --> 01:34:03.640
<v Speaker 1>Super cold weather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if I can in my stocking around,</v>

2197
01:34:03.641 --> 01:34:05.530
<v Speaker 1>I can walk around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can move.</v>

2198
01:34:05.710 --> 01:34:07.300
<v Speaker 1>It's not that cold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you.</v>

2199
01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:09.310
<v Speaker 1>The whole point of sitting in a tree </v>
<v Speaker 1>stand,</v>

2200
01:34:09.460 --> 01:34:10.293
<v Speaker 1>you have to try and sit completely 100 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent still and move as little as </v>

2201
01:34:14.350 --> 01:34:15.580
<v Speaker 1>possible and you're freezing your dick </v>
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>

2202
01:34:15.610 --> 01:34:17.440
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't even have to be that cold for</v>

2203
01:34:17.441 --> 01:34:18.760
<v Speaker 1>you to freeze.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2204
01:34:18.850 --> 01:34:21.150
<v Speaker 1>If you're trying not to move,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2205
01:34:21.580 --> 01:34:23.770
<v Speaker 1>it can be in the fifties and you'd be </v>
<v Speaker 1>freezing your balls off.</v>

2206
01:34:23.800 --> 01:34:25.520
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you're not moving so your body's</v>

2207
01:34:25.540 --> 01:34:28.000
<v Speaker 1>not generating heat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I've hunted when it's like,</v>

2208
01:34:28.140 --> 01:34:28.973
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight degrees or 10 degrees in eastern </v>

2209
01:34:29.951 --> 01:34:32.950
<v Speaker 1>Colorado and I was okay because I could </v>
<v Speaker 1>move.</v>

2210
01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:36.490
<v Speaker 1>You know that you're taking layers off </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're going up hills.</v>

2211
01:34:36.550 --> 01:34:37.383
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that is one of the things that's </v>

2212
01:34:38.351 --> 01:34:39.184
<v Speaker 1>really interesting to me about hunting </v>
<v Speaker 1>and cold weather is the whole layering </v>

2213
01:34:42.131 --> 01:34:46.450
<v Speaker 1>system is that you have to really be </v>
<v Speaker 1>aware of when you're sweating.</v>

2214
01:34:46.780 --> 01:34:50.980
<v Speaker 1>So the whole key is to get yourself to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the point where you're never sweating so</v>

2215
01:34:50.981 --> 01:34:51.814
<v Speaker 1>as your mood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you're sweating and then you </v>

2216
01:34:52.781 --> 01:34:54.730
<v Speaker 1>have to cool off and then you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sweat,</v>

2217
01:34:54.731 --> 01:34:58.040
<v Speaker 1>it kills herself up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your clothes are wet from</v>

2218
01:34:58.130 --> 01:34:59.060
<v Speaker 4>sweat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're fucked.</v>

2219
01:34:59.110 --> 01:35:00.050
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2220
01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:00.913
<v Speaker 4>that's one of the beautiful things about</v>
<v Speaker 4>wool is that will allow you to retain </v>

2221
01:35:03.771 --> 01:35:05.420
<v Speaker 4>your body heat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even if it's wet,</v>

2222
01:35:05.610 --> 01:35:06.320
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he doesn't,</v>

2223
01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:07.153
<v Speaker 4>doesn't really fuck with you the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>way that a lot of synthetics and </v>

2224
01:35:09.050 --> 01:35:12.170
<v Speaker 4>particularly cotton cotton's the worse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2225
01:35:12.410 --> 01:35:13.880
<v Speaker 4>Synthetics are good because they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

2226
01:35:13.910 --> 01:35:14.840
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll,</v>

2227
01:35:14.860 --> 01:35:16.180
<v Speaker 4>they'll dry quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2228
01:35:16.400 --> 01:35:17.270
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2229
01:35:17.540 --> 01:35:18.373
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever seen that rewarming drill </v>
<v Speaker 4>that John Barklow from Sitka did where </v>

2230
01:35:21.651 --> 01:35:26.651
<v Speaker 4>he jumps in a river with wet clothes and</v>
<v Speaker 4>chose how to heat your body back up now.</v>

2231
01:35:27.141 --> 01:35:27.974
<v Speaker 4>But I just did a hunt with a um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just had a hunt with John Hart from </v>

2232
01:35:35.900 --> 01:35:38.420
<v Speaker 4>Sitka.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2233
01:35:38.600 --> 01:35:40.010
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a great guy.</v>

2234
01:35:40.040 --> 01:35:40.873
<v Speaker 4>He's a great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was a lot of fun hunting with and we </v>

2235
01:35:42.261 --> 01:35:44.660
<v Speaker 4>talked about survival stuff a bit like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2236
01:35:44.661 --> 01:35:45.494
<v Speaker 4>stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what do you do if you fall in a </v>

2237
01:35:46.521 --> 01:35:47.354
<v Speaker 4>river and it's cold.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That guy who attend me is like one of </v>

2238
01:35:49.581 --> 01:35:51.530
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean because he owns the company.</v>

2239
01:35:51.531 --> 01:35:52.364
<v Speaker 4>He's one of the best representations of </v>
<v Speaker 4>what you would want from a guy who owns </v>

2240
01:35:56.570 --> 01:35:57.403
<v Speaker 4>a big company,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who was a ceo of a big company that's </v>

2241
01:35:59.241 --> 01:36:01.280
<v Speaker 4>involved in hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Super Smart,</v>

2242
01:36:01.281 --> 01:36:04.850
<v Speaker 4>really articulate conservation minded,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very ethical,</v>

2243
01:36:04.880 --> 01:36:07.010
<v Speaker 4>just solid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>super solid.</v>

2244
01:36:07.130 --> 01:36:08.780
<v Speaker 4>I was with him in Utah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2245
01:36:09.260 --> 01:36:10.190
<v Speaker 4>Great Guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2246
01:36:12.350 --> 01:36:14.450
<v Speaker 4>Awesome company too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know you're a good stuff.</v>

2247
01:36:14.510 --> 01:36:15.310
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

2248
01:36:15.310 --> 01:36:16.010
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

2249
01:36:16.010 --> 01:36:16.341
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2250
01:36:16.341 --> 01:36:18.530
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of good stuff out there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I just,</v>

2251
01:36:18.531 --> 01:36:19.250
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2252
01:36:19.250 --> 01:36:19.910
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

2253
01:36:19.910 --> 01:36:23.460
<v Speaker 4>I'm hoping I stay warm on this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on his hunt in BC.</v>

2254
01:36:24.270 --> 01:36:26.360
<v Speaker 4>Where were you guys were in Hawaii.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2255
01:36:26.361 --> 01:36:27.530
<v Speaker 4>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>

2256
01:36:27.531 --> 01:36:28.364
<v Speaker 4>I was thinking you were in that Moose </v>
<v Speaker 4>hunt that they just come back from </v>

2257
01:36:30.160 --> 01:36:31.040
<v Speaker 4>China.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're hunting in Hawaii.</v>

2258
01:36:31.220 --> 01:36:34.460
<v Speaker 4>So you were in that crazy ranch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's somewhere on the big island.</v>

2259
01:36:34.461 --> 01:36:35.480
<v Speaker 4>The people never hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2260
01:36:35.780 --> 01:36:37.910
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some big area.</v>

2261
01:36:38.690 --> 01:36:39.590
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were,</v>

2262
01:36:39.591 --> 01:36:41.660
<v Speaker 4>we were hunting on the big island.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2263
01:36:41.880 --> 01:36:44.440
<v Speaker 4>we're hunting pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It,</v>

2264
01:36:44.490 --> 01:36:46.880
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was hunting in an area that was like,</v>

2265
01:36:46.920 --> 01:36:49.190
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I explain it.</v>

2266
01:36:49.191 --> 01:36:49.491
<v Speaker 4>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2267
01:36:49.491 --> 01:36:50.324
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're hunting these big bars on the big </v>

2268
01:36:52.191 --> 01:36:53.190
<v Speaker 4>island.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

2269
01:36:53.590 --> 01:36:54.860
<v Speaker 4>it was a lot of fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was great.</v>

2270
01:36:54.920 --> 01:36:55.580
<v Speaker 4>But he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>

2271
01:36:55.580 --> 01:36:57.290
<v Speaker 4>he's a really good dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2272
01:36:57.291 --> 01:37:00.950
<v Speaker 4>Did they have like numbers that they </v>
<v Speaker 4>have to keep the pigs down to,</v>

2273
01:37:01.100 --> 01:37:03.080
<v Speaker 4>do they have like a point where the pigs</v>
<v Speaker 4>reach?</v>

2274
01:37:03.230 --> 01:37:04.063
<v Speaker 4>Because for people who don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it really does have several litters a </v>

2275
01:37:06.021 --> 01:37:10.340
<v Speaker 4>year and if they're not because there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>no predators on Hawaii.</v>

2276
01:37:10.460 --> 01:37:12.830
<v Speaker 4>So if the pigs aren't kept in check by </v>
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

2277
01:37:12.860 --> 01:37:13.693
<v Speaker 4>they'll get completely out of hand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So do they have wildlife biologists who </v>

2278
01:37:16.761 --> 01:37:20.480
<v Speaker 4>manage the numbers and try to decide </v>
<v Speaker 4>like what to do?</v>

2279
01:37:20.510 --> 01:37:21.343
<v Speaker 4>They just try and kill as many as again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they just have people hunt </v>

2280
01:37:22.760 --> 01:37:23.593
<v Speaker 4>constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2281
01:37:24.100 --> 01:37:26.360
<v Speaker 4>And is it not a problem because so many </v>
<v Speaker 4>people hunt there?</v>

2282
01:37:27.530 --> 01:37:29.930
<v Speaker 4>I mean it just sorta depends who you </v>
<v Speaker 4>ask.</v>

2283
01:37:30.040 --> 01:37:30.860
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2284
01:37:30.860 --> 01:37:31.693
<v Speaker 4>it's crazy because like with the pigs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the pigs can thrive and really thick </v>

2285
01:37:35.900 --> 01:37:36.733
<v Speaker 4>areas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there is very difficult to do like a </v>

2286
01:37:38.810 --> 01:37:40.790
<v Speaker 4>to figure out how many pigs there are.</v>

2287
01:37:41.150 --> 01:37:43.400
<v Speaker 4>Like if you try and count the number of </v>
<v Speaker 4>deer on Maui,</v>

2288
01:37:43.460 --> 01:37:45.110
<v Speaker 4>people count them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My friend Jake does it,</v>

2289
01:37:45.470 --> 01:37:49.250
<v Speaker 4>he'll fly in the grid and they'll get a </v>
<v Speaker 4>pretty darn accurate reading of how many</v>

2290
01:37:49.251 --> 01:37:50.084
<v Speaker 4>deer on the island,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but try and figure out how many pigs on </v>

2291
01:37:51.801 --> 01:37:53.660
<v Speaker 4>the big island.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's impossible.</v>

2292
01:37:53.720 --> 01:37:55.040
<v Speaker 4>They live in the jungle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2293
01:37:55.050 --> 01:37:57.820
<v Speaker 4>Because they're all in underbrush.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They.</v>

2294
01:37:58.490 --> 01:37:59.311
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the deer,</v>

2295
01:37:59.311 --> 01:38:00.480
<v Speaker 4>they come out in the open,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2296
01:38:00.481 --> 01:38:03.030
<v Speaker 4>and you chased him with a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with a helicopter and you can see them.</v>

2297
01:38:03.031 --> 01:38:04.440
<v Speaker 4>They're all running pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't do that.</v>

2298
01:38:04.460 --> 01:38:08.910
<v Speaker 4>Just go right into the thick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So basically there's infinite numbers of</v>

2299
01:38:08.970 --> 01:38:12.690
<v Speaker 4>pigs on the big island.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So do they also have sheep?</v>

2300
01:38:12.691 --> 01:38:14.080
<v Speaker 4>We have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have moved on sheet.</v>

2301
01:38:14.081 --> 01:38:16.050
<v Speaker 4>We have like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a hybrid sheep.</v>

2302
01:38:16.110 --> 01:38:18.710
<v Speaker 4>We have um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we got goats and,</v>

2303
01:38:18.711 --> 01:38:21.690
<v Speaker 4>and those you can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can get numbers of and you can knock</v>

2304
01:38:21.691 --> 01:38:23.490
<v Speaker 4>them down really quick if you're trying </v>
<v Speaker 4>to eradicate them.</v>

2305
01:38:24.180 --> 01:38:25.260
<v Speaker 4>Pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really difficult.</v>

2306
01:38:25.770 --> 01:38:28.170
<v Speaker 4>How did the move launch?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cheap taste move on.</v>

2307
01:38:28.171 --> 01:38:29.004
<v Speaker 4>Cheaper.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Amazing.</v>

2308
01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:30.030
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what I've heard.</v>

2309
01:38:30.130 --> 01:38:32.890
<v Speaker 4>They're really fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're great to hunt.</v>

2310
01:38:33.600 --> 01:38:34.433
<v Speaker 4>Did you see that controversy that </v>
<v Speaker 4>happened pretty recently where a woman </v>

2311
01:38:37.111 --> 01:38:40.770
<v Speaker 4>shot a shot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a wild sheep?</v>

2312
01:38:41.620 --> 01:38:42.453
<v Speaker 4>I did one year up goat Europe in Europe </v>
<v Speaker 4>and people were upset at her and all </v>

2313
01:38:47.341 --> 01:38:49.920
<v Speaker 4>these Ricky Gervais',</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course he has to jump in.</v>

2314
01:38:50.310 --> 01:38:52.860
<v Speaker 4>That's his favorite thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Glenn Greenwald,</v>

2315
01:38:52.861 --> 01:38:53.694
<v Speaker 4>all these people jumped in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What would they don't understand is </v>

2316
01:38:55.541 --> 01:39:00.541
<v Speaker 4>these wild goats are invasive species.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have no natural predators and they.</v>

2317
01:39:00.740 --> 01:39:05.340
<v Speaker 4>They hunt them to preserve the wildlife.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's indicative,</v>

2318
01:39:05.790 --> 01:39:10.380
<v Speaker 4>that's native to the area.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whether it's the plant life,</v>

2319
01:39:10.710 --> 01:39:12.420
<v Speaker 4>animal life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean these,</v>

2320
01:39:12.421 --> 01:39:15.510
<v Speaker 4>these goats,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if their populations are left unchecked,</v>

2321
01:39:16.040 --> 01:39:18.240
<v Speaker 4>they hunt them for a very specific </v>
<v Speaker 4>reason,</v>

2322
01:39:18.241 --> 01:39:19.074
<v Speaker 4>like really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you talked to some wildlife </v>

2323
01:39:20.401 --> 01:39:21.234
<v Speaker 4>biologists?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They should be eradicated because there </v>

2324
01:39:23.601 --> 01:39:23.640
<v Speaker 4>are.</v>

2325
01:39:23.640 --> 01:39:24.473
<v Speaker 4>A lot of them were left on islands.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People don't realize this by whalers </v>

2326
01:39:29.410 --> 01:39:30.243
<v Speaker 4>the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They left them on these islands because </v>

2327
01:39:31.441 --> 01:39:32.274
<v Speaker 4>this was an island off of a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe it was off of Ireland or </v>

2328
01:39:34.471 --> 01:39:36.840
<v Speaker 4>Scotland.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See if you can find that story.</v>

2329
01:39:36.870 --> 01:39:37.703
<v Speaker 4>Scotland,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of them are left there by by </v>

2330
01:39:40.051 --> 01:39:43.260
<v Speaker 4>travelers so that they would have food </v>
<v Speaker 4>there when they came back,</v>

2331
01:39:43.560 --> 01:39:44.393
<v Speaker 4>so they would drop these things off on </v>
<v Speaker 4>these certain islands and in fact there </v>

2332
01:39:47.701 --> 01:39:51.300
<v Speaker 4>was a real area,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a real problem where they drop them off,</v>

2333
01:39:51.301 --> 01:39:52.134
<v Speaker 4>so this was the woman and people got all</v>
<v Speaker 4>over this lady for shooting this wild </v>

2334
01:39:55.321 --> 01:39:56.154
<v Speaker 4>goat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is really kind of crazy because </v>

2335
01:39:56.941 --> 01:39:58.830
<v Speaker 4>they eat them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're delicious.</v>

2336
01:39:58.831 --> 01:40:01.200
<v Speaker 4>They either have his food,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're invasive.</v>

2337
01:40:01.340 --> 01:40:02.173
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's so many things going in </v>
<v Speaker 4>in toe pointing towards the direction </v>

2338
01:40:06.661 --> 01:40:10.290
<v Speaker 4>that this was actually a smart </v>
<v Speaker 4>conservation thing to do,</v>

2339
01:40:10.650 --> 01:40:14.490
<v Speaker 4>but I guess maybe it was because of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>way she talked about it.</v>

2340
01:40:15.380 --> 01:40:16.213
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because she said it was a really fun </v>

2341
01:40:16.981 --> 01:40:19.800
<v Speaker 4>hunt or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like I get it,</v>

2342
01:40:20.190 --> 01:40:21.023
<v Speaker 4>it's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like a beautiful creature and it </v>

2343
01:40:22.770 --> 01:40:24.630
<v Speaker 4>would have still been alive if she </v>
<v Speaker 4>wasn't there.</v>

2344
01:40:24.690 --> 01:40:28.290
<v Speaker 4>So that perspective of people just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know why you got to kill it?</v>

2345
01:40:28.500 --> 01:40:29.020
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2346
01:40:29.020 --> 01:40:29.853
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>

2347
01:40:29.890 --> 01:40:31.290
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a wild animal.</v>

2348
01:40:31.291 --> 01:40:33.300
<v Speaker 4>Living on an island,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't just let them live.</v>

2349
01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:34.193
<v Speaker 4>It's a natural perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's as simple as that normal human </v>

2350
01:40:36.301 --> 01:40:37.134
<v Speaker 4>nature to think that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know all the people who think </v>

2351
01:40:40.381 --> 01:40:41.214
<v Speaker 4>that if you dig a little deeper,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot more information there </v>

2352
01:40:42.900 --> 01:40:43.733
<v Speaker 4>with those.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just can't let those go to get out </v>

2353
01:40:44.551 --> 01:40:46.020
<v Speaker 4>of hand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was hardy as hell.</v>

2354
01:40:46.320 --> 01:40:49.400
<v Speaker 4>They don't die,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's the problem with Greg.</v>

2355
01:40:51.560 --> 01:40:56.470
<v Speaker 4>I'm Ricky Gervais' or Glenn Greenwald,</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone like that,</v>

2356
01:40:56.471 --> 01:40:57.304
<v Speaker 4>that has a giant platform that loves </v>
<v Speaker 4>animals and I appreciate that and that </v>

2357
01:41:01.360 --> 01:41:02.193
<v Speaker 4>instantly post something like this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very inflammatory without looking into </v>

2358
01:41:05.351 --> 01:41:06.184
<v Speaker 4>it deeper.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They use their platform and they think </v>

2359
01:41:08.531 --> 01:41:10.330
<v Speaker 4>to expose something they think is </v>
<v Speaker 4>horrific,</v>

2360
01:41:10.331 --> 01:41:12.280
<v Speaker 4>but they don't understand what's going </v>
<v Speaker 4>on behind the scenes of this.</v>

2361
01:41:12.670 --> 01:41:13.503
<v Speaker 4>There's a thing called Judas goats,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and what they do is they'll take a goat </v>

2362
01:41:16.900 --> 01:41:17.733
<v Speaker 4>and they'll noodle that goat and put a </v>
<v Speaker 4>gps tag on it and send it out because </v>

2363
01:41:21.410 --> 01:41:22.243
<v Speaker 4>goats always flock together in this goat</v>
<v Speaker 4>will go near the other goats and then </v>

2364
01:41:26.021 --> 01:41:26.854
<v Speaker 4>they fly over with helicopters and gun </v>
<v Speaker 4>these goats down and this is just to </v>

2365
01:41:30.791 --> 01:41:33.620
<v Speaker 4>keep goat populations in check so they </v>
<v Speaker 4>kill every goal,</v>

2366
01:41:33.621 --> 01:41:35.810
<v Speaker 4>but the Judas Goat and then the Judas </v>
<v Speaker 4>go,</v>

2367
01:41:35.811 --> 01:41:36.644
<v Speaker 4>we'll find other goats and then they fly</v>
<v Speaker 4>over again and gone all the goats down </v>

2368
01:41:40.120 --> 01:41:43.330
<v Speaker 4>and this is done by wildlife biologist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right by my house.</v>

2369
01:41:43.660 --> 01:41:47.650
<v Speaker 4>They do this just because those goats </v>
<v Speaker 4>eat everything.</v>

2370
01:41:47.680 --> 01:41:48.513
<v Speaker 4>I have a friend who lives in Topanga and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they bought goats to clean their </v>

2371
01:41:50.891 --> 01:41:52.180
<v Speaker 4>property.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They thought,</v>

2372
01:41:52.210 --> 01:41:53.380
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this would be a good idea.</v>

2373
01:41:53.530 --> 01:41:54.363
<v Speaker 4>We'll bring these goats in and they'll </v>
<v Speaker 4>eat all the weeds and they'll know they </v>

2374
01:41:56.501 --> 01:41:57.460
<v Speaker 4>eat everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything.</v>

2375
01:41:57.490 --> 01:41:58.323
<v Speaker 4>Every last thing they keep going and </v>
<v Speaker 4>still they'll decimate local wildlife </v>

2376
01:42:02.230 --> 01:42:03.063
<v Speaker 4>like whatever their their habitat is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They'll devastate all these local </v>

2377
01:42:06.221 --> 01:42:07.054
<v Speaker 4>plants.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean things that are supposed to be </v>

2378
01:42:09.161 --> 01:42:12.130
<v Speaker 4>there that have been there forever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When these invasive species get there,</v>

2379
01:42:12.280 --> 01:42:13.113
<v Speaker 4>they have a really hard time maintaining</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then it gets to a point where they </v>

2380
01:42:16.871 --> 01:42:18.280
<v Speaker 4>have to do something about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2381
01:42:18.281 --> 01:42:21.460
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this woman paid to do that so that money</v>

2382
01:42:21.461 --> 01:42:24.100
<v Speaker 4>goes towards conservation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She gets to eat the meat,</v>

2383
01:42:24.340 --> 01:42:25.173
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she has this enjoyable experience </v>

2384
01:42:26.741 --> 01:42:30.670
<v Speaker 4>hunting these things in the mountains,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but people don't want to look at that.</v>

2385
01:42:30.730 --> 01:42:32.470
<v Speaker 4>They just want to look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It shouldn't die,</v>

2386
01:42:32.610 --> 01:42:33.443
<v Speaker 4>and it's really particularly crazy when </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a guy like Ricky Gervais' who eats </v>

2387
01:42:35.831 --> 01:42:36.950
<v Speaker 4>meat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2388
01:42:37.140 --> 01:42:39.430
<v Speaker 4>so like the whole thing is just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so strange.</v>

2389
01:42:39.460 --> 01:42:40.293
<v Speaker 4>It's just so strange that people refuse </v>
<v Speaker 4>to look deeper into these things and </v>

2390
01:42:43.811 --> 01:42:44.644
<v Speaker 4>they immediately have these knee jerk </v>
<v Speaker 4>reactions where they want to complain </v>

2391
01:42:46.931 --> 01:42:47.764
<v Speaker 4>about it and do so publicly in a way </v>
<v Speaker 4>that gets all these people to attack </v>

2392
01:42:50.741 --> 01:42:51.431
<v Speaker 4>this woman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2393
01:42:51.431 --> 01:42:54.080
<v Speaker 4>the photo of that dead animal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what.</v>

2394
01:42:54.170 --> 01:42:56.650
<v Speaker 4>That's what initiates that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that response,</v>

2395
01:42:57.160 --> 01:43:02.160
<v Speaker 4>emotional response.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That gets smiling and then they'll go to</v>

2396
01:43:02.861 --> 01:43:07.600
<v Speaker 4>the fridge and grab some steak and cook </v>
<v Speaker 4>it and think nothing of it.</v>

2397
01:43:08.050 --> 01:43:10.030
<v Speaker 4>Nothing at all of that meat is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't.</v>

2398
01:43:10.060 --> 01:43:10.893
<v Speaker 4>They don't see the parallel there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they just think that it's completely </v>

2399
01:43:13.151 --> 01:43:15.220
<v Speaker 4>different than weird that someone wants </v>
<v Speaker 4>to go hunt them.</v>

2400
01:43:15.490 --> 01:43:19.330
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's fucked up in this weird accepted,</v>

2401
01:43:19.331 --> 01:43:20.260
<v Speaker 4>hypocritical way.</v>

2402
01:43:20.350 --> 01:43:22.180
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's oddly accepted,</v>

2403
01:43:22.420 --> 01:43:23.253
<v Speaker 4>but we all have freezers full of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>best meat there is and eat it every </v>

2404
01:43:26.081 --> 01:43:28.180
<v Speaker 4>night and it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm never going to stop.</v>

2405
01:43:28.300 --> 01:43:29.260
<v Speaker 4>We do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2406
01:43:29.261 --> 01:43:31.300
<v Speaker 4>We that hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We do that.</v>

2407
01:43:31.301 --> 01:43:32.920
<v Speaker 4>We actually have that connection with </v>
<v Speaker 4>that meat.</v>

2408
01:43:33.370 --> 01:43:34.630
<v Speaker 4>We killed it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We skinned it,</v>

2409
01:43:34.631 --> 01:43:35.770
<v Speaker 4>we got the meat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we de-bone it.</v>

2410
01:43:35.771 --> 01:43:36.604
<v Speaker 4>We packed it out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We packaged it and put it in our </v>

2411
01:43:38.201 --> 01:43:39.840
<v Speaker 4>freezers ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But this is the first step.</v>

2412
01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:40.713
<v Speaker 4>Second.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Awesome.</v>

2413
01:43:40.850 --> 01:43:41.683
<v Speaker 4>It's the first ever seen someone get </v>
<v Speaker 4>attacked at something that's immediate </v>

2414
01:43:43.810 --> 01:43:45.970
<v Speaker 4>animal because a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen people,</v>

2415
01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:47.620
<v Speaker 4>maybe they don't know what's a meat </v>
<v Speaker 4>animal,</v>

2416
01:43:47.740 --> 01:43:48.573
<v Speaker 4>but I've seen people get attacked for </v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously for anything like that it's </v>

2417
01:43:51.810 --> 01:43:52.340
<v Speaker 4>appliance</v>

2418
01:43:52.340 --> 01:43:55.250
<v Speaker 3>and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Predator one is the biggest one I'll</v>

2419
01:43:55.251 --> 01:43:56.720
<v Speaker 3>give you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kill something that's a predator.</v>

2420
01:43:56.721 --> 01:43:59.690
<v Speaker 3>People for whatever weird reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>freak out more than anything.</v>

2421
01:44:00.830 --> 01:44:01.980
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if there's any,</v>

2422
01:44:01.981 --> 01:44:03.260
<v Speaker 3>if there's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>

2423
01:44:03.290 --> 01:44:04.123
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a general idea that they're </v>

2424
01:44:05.570 --> 01:44:06.890
<v Speaker 3>endangered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2425
01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:07.873
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like everybody thinks that lions are </v>

2426
01:44:08.841 --> 01:44:09.674
<v Speaker 3>endangered or elephants are endangered </v>
<v Speaker 3>or even bear bears are embarrassed or </v>

2427
01:44:13.170 --> 01:44:13.900
<v Speaker 3>danger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2428
01:44:13.900 --> 01:44:14.980
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2429
01:44:15.440 --> 01:44:16.273
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of misconceptions out </v>

2430
01:44:16.851 --> 01:44:17.684
<v Speaker 3>there for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I don't really eat lions or </v>

2431
01:44:20.121 --> 01:44:21.770
<v Speaker 3>elephants or.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like that idea.</v>

2432
01:44:21.800 --> 01:44:23.810
<v Speaker 3>And there's millions of deer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Millions.</v>

2433
01:44:24.410 --> 01:44:25.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Literally.</v>

2434
01:44:25.220 --> 01:44:26.053
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean where we hunt in Lanai has 3000 </v>

2435
01:44:29.001 --> 01:44:32.540
<v Speaker 3>people more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They estimate somewhere over 20,000</v>

2436
01:44:32.541 --> 01:44:36.130
<v Speaker 3>deer and they don't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's just an Nana's.</v>

2437
01:44:36.210 --> 01:44:39.400
<v Speaker 3>I'm on a text thread with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with Benny O'Brian and Rennie and,</v>

2438
01:44:39.670 --> 01:44:41.030
<v Speaker 3>and I'll and all you guys.</v>

2439
01:44:41.270 --> 01:44:43.460
<v Speaker 3>And there was a stat that they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying yesterday,</v>

2440
01:44:43.461 --> 01:44:47.150
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you're on that text and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were saying that like in one of the</v>

2441
01:44:47.151 --> 01:44:48.860
<v Speaker 3>Midwest states,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know which one it was.</v>

2442
01:44:48.861 --> 01:44:51.680
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember in one of the Midwest </v>
<v Speaker 3>states,</v>

2443
01:44:52.070 --> 01:44:52.903
<v Speaker 3>like 850,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>deer die during gun season and half of </v>

2444
01:44:57.201 --> 01:45:00.530
<v Speaker 3>them like 400,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>deer die in the first two days because.</v>

2445
01:45:00.540 --> 01:45:02.450
<v Speaker 3>Because we were talking about Adam being</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the tree.</v>

2446
01:45:02.570 --> 01:45:05.240
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In one state alone,</v>

2447
01:45:05.330 --> 01:45:07.730
<v Speaker 3>850,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>deer die during gun season.</v>

2448
01:45:08.160 --> 01:45:08.993
<v Speaker 3>So you think of how many deer that is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine if no one hunted for like three </v>

2449
01:45:11.031 --> 01:45:13.040
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was that stat?</v>

2450
01:45:13.070 --> 01:45:18.070
<v Speaker 3>How many deer there would be the number </v>
<v Speaker 3>of car accidents nationwide with dear?</v>

2451
01:45:19.760 --> 01:45:22.970
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a million and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2452
01:45:23.270 --> 01:45:24.103
<v Speaker 3>but the people who get angry at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>photos don't think of what it would be </v>

2453
01:45:26.961 --> 01:45:28.490
<v Speaker 3>like if you just stopped hunting.</v>

2454
01:45:28.730 --> 01:45:29.563
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2455
01:45:29.660 --> 01:45:34.660
<v Speaker 3>How many goats Arab he imagined,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dear nature would sort itself out.</v>

2456
01:45:35.120 --> 01:45:36.160
<v Speaker 3>It wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2457
01:45:36.170 --> 01:45:38.030
<v Speaker 3>it would eventually be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd have to bring in wolves.</v>

2458
01:45:38.240 --> 01:45:40.240
<v Speaker 3>If you're comfortable with wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eat and your kids.</v>

2459
01:45:40.520 --> 01:45:41.353
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yours and all that big bad wolf shit </v>

2460
01:45:43.251 --> 01:45:45.230
<v Speaker 3>from when we're little kids like little </v>
<v Speaker 3>pig,</v>

2461
01:45:45.231 --> 01:45:46.160
<v Speaker 3>little pig.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me in.</v>

2462
01:45:46.280 --> 01:45:48.890
<v Speaker 3>That's because wolves were everywhere </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they were bad.</v>

2463
01:45:49.160 --> 01:45:52.880
<v Speaker 3>It was dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you would go through people's kids.</v>

2464
01:45:53.820 --> 01:45:55.140
<v Speaker 3>That really did happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2465
01:45:55.370 --> 01:45:57.800
<v Speaker 3>We just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've got so far away from that.</v>

2466
01:45:57.801 --> 01:46:01.340
<v Speaker 3>We forgot about it as a possibility,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so now we think of them as dogs that are</v>

2467
01:46:01.341 --> 01:46:02.174
<v Speaker 3>living their natural,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that dogs just living his best life out </v>

2468
01:46:04.881 --> 01:46:07.420
<v Speaker 3>in the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How other one,</v>

2469
01:46:07.430 --> 01:46:08.750
<v Speaker 3>they howl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're trying,</v>

2470
01:46:08.780 --> 01:46:10.190
<v Speaker 3>they're trying to figure out how to eat </v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

2471
01:46:10.350 --> 01:46:11.183
<v Speaker 3>They want to get through your house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which they're trying to figure out how </v>

2472
01:46:12.801 --> 01:46:15.560
<v Speaker 3>to eat your kids and if you reintroduce </v>
<v Speaker 3>them into yellow stone,</v>

2473
01:46:15.561 --> 01:46:16.700
<v Speaker 3>they're never going to leave </v>
<v Speaker 3>yellowstone.</v>

2474
01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:17.833
<v Speaker 3>You're going to stay there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to stay right in this </v>

2475
01:46:18.891 --> 01:46:21.530
<v Speaker 3>little pocket of where they like to </v>
<v Speaker 3>live.</v>

2476
01:46:21.870 --> 01:46:23.960
<v Speaker 3>They're never going to reproduce into </v>
<v Speaker 3>like thousands.</v>

2477
01:46:24.140 --> 01:46:26.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are those people think,</v>

2478
01:46:26.871 --> 01:46:29.560
<v Speaker 3>but really they're going to just start </v>
<v Speaker 3>roaming and.</v>

2479
01:46:29.561 --> 01:46:31.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and recreating thousands,</v>

2480
01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:32.833
<v Speaker 3>thousands and thousands of walls that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are all going to go into neighborhoods </v>

2481
01:46:34.941 --> 01:46:38.570
<v Speaker 3>eventually when that's what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what's happening in Montana.</v>

2482
01:46:38.571 --> 01:46:40.160
<v Speaker 3>That's what's happening in Idaho.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2483
01:46:40.290 --> 01:46:41.123
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are all reintroduced wolves that </v>

2484
01:46:41.931 --> 01:46:42.764
<v Speaker 3>are mean and they also go on the surplus</v>
<v Speaker 3>kills or they'll kill like 15 elk and </v>

2485
01:46:46.461 --> 01:46:48.650
<v Speaker 3>just leave them there and they just go </v>
<v Speaker 3>nutty.</v>

2486
01:46:48.770 --> 01:46:49.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what they do.</v>

2487
01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:50.873
<v Speaker 4>My friend lives in Montana and he was </v>
<v Speaker 4>telling me that the wolf population is </v>

2488
01:46:54.301 --> 01:46:55.134
<v Speaker 4>so out of hand that the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the elk population has been </v>

2489
01:46:57.301 --> 01:46:58.920
<v Speaker 4>decimated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>

2490
01:46:58.970 --> 01:47:01.530
<v Speaker 4>it's down by like 80 percent or some </v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy stat.</v>

2491
01:47:01.800 --> 01:47:05.310
<v Speaker 4>Crazy though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2492
01:47:05.430 --> 01:47:06.263
<v Speaker 4>They weren't there in 1994.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's when they reintroduced </v>

2493
01:47:08.881 --> 01:47:09.750
<v Speaker 4>them right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In the nineties.</v>

2494
01:47:09.770 --> 01:47:10.603
<v Speaker 4>So Yah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's,</v>

2495
01:47:10.680 --> 01:47:11.513
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean now that I mean now that human </v>

2496
01:47:16.291 --> 01:47:17.124
<v Speaker 4>population is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is so established and a lot of these </v>

2497
01:47:18.601 --> 01:47:22.080
<v Speaker 4>areas and you can't just reintroduce </v>
<v Speaker 4>wolves with no plan to keep,</v>

2498
01:47:22.230 --> 01:47:23.100
<v Speaker 4>keep a lid on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2499
01:47:23.101 --> 01:47:23.934
<v Speaker 4>there is a plan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the problem with the plan is the </v>

2500
01:47:25.861 --> 01:47:26.694
<v Speaker 4>established numbers that they needed to </v>
<v Speaker 4>achieve in before they start managing </v>

2501
01:47:29.701 --> 01:47:30.534
<v Speaker 4>the population than there was immediate </v>
<v Speaker 4>lawsuits by animal rights activists who </v>

2502
01:47:33.481 --> 01:47:35.390
<v Speaker 4>don't want them to ever hunt wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2503
01:47:35.850 --> 01:47:37.800
<v Speaker 4>So in Montana they've opened up seasons.</v>

2504
01:47:37.800 --> 01:47:41.010
<v Speaker 4>They've opened up seasons in Idaho,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've opened up seasons for wolves and</v>

2505
01:47:41.011 --> 01:47:43.470
<v Speaker 4>they would like to do the same for </v>
<v Speaker 4>grizzly bears and all of these areas,</v>

2506
01:47:43.471 --> 01:47:45.090
<v Speaker 4>and there's a lot of pushback on that </v>
<v Speaker 4>too,</v>

2507
01:47:45.091 --> 01:47:48.090
<v Speaker 4>but it's the same sort of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the established numbers that they needed</v>

2508
01:47:48.091 --> 01:47:48.924
<v Speaker 4>to achieve in order to make it a </v>
<v Speaker 4>sustainable population they've been </v>

2509
01:47:51.511 --> 01:47:53.730
<v Speaker 4>reached and then the wildlife </v>
<v Speaker 4>biologists,</v>

2510
01:47:53.740 --> 01:47:55.590
<v Speaker 4>the ones are objective about are saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

2511
01:47:55.800 --> 01:47:56.633
<v Speaker 4>we need to keep these populations in </v>
<v Speaker 4>check in order to keep the deer </v>

2512
01:47:58.621 --> 01:47:59.454
<v Speaker 4>populations healthy and the Moose </v>
<v Speaker 4>populations healthy because these bears </v>

2513
01:48:02.131 --> 01:48:04.830
<v Speaker 4>and these wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're just destroying these calves and</v>

2514
01:48:04.831 --> 01:48:07.920
<v Speaker 4>they just run around and the populations</v>
<v Speaker 4>of these animals go way down.</v>

2515
01:48:08.070 --> 01:48:12.600
<v Speaker 4>Now there's also an argument and a </v>
<v Speaker 4>really good one that you need predators,</v>

2516
01:48:12.990 --> 01:48:17.990
<v Speaker 4>and this good argument is you don't ever</v>
<v Speaker 4>want to be recreated in Montana,</v>

2517
01:48:18.270 --> 01:48:18.690
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2518
01:48:18.690 --> 01:48:22.020
<v Speaker 4>Where there's just these deer and these </v>
<v Speaker 4>elk.</v>

2519
01:48:22.290 --> 01:48:23.123
<v Speaker 4>You want a certain natural balance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so there's an argument that there </v>

2520
01:48:25.951 --> 01:48:29.340
<v Speaker 4>should be a certain amount of wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I agree with that argument.</v>

2521
01:48:29.550 --> 01:48:30.383
<v Speaker 4>I agree too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the balance can be really difficult </v>

2522
01:48:31.831 --> 01:48:32.760
<v Speaker 4>to maintain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2523
01:48:32.790 --> 01:48:33.623
<v Speaker 4>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's my point is like if there's too </v>

2524
01:48:35.011 --> 01:48:36.900
<v Speaker 4>many elk and you want to control that </v>
<v Speaker 4>number,</v>

2525
01:48:36.930 --> 01:48:39.480
<v Speaker 4>say there's $100,000,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there should only be $50,000.</v>

2526
01:48:39.500 --> 01:48:40.740
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the perfect number.</v>

2527
01:48:41.190 --> 01:48:43.760
<v Speaker 4>It's actually pretty easy to go from </v>
<v Speaker 4>100,000</v>

2528
01:48:43.761 --> 01:48:44.760
<v Speaker 4>and 50,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>to trial.</v>

2529
01:48:44.761 --> 01:48:48.510
<v Speaker 4>That elk herd back pretty easy through </v>
<v Speaker 4>through management and through hunting.</v>

2530
01:48:48.810 --> 01:48:49.643
<v Speaker 4>Same with deer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can pull that number back pretty </v>

2531
01:48:50.761 --> 01:48:53.760
<v Speaker 4>quick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wolves are fricking hard to kill,</v>

2532
01:48:53.761 --> 01:48:54.570
<v Speaker 4>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2533
01:48:54.570 --> 01:48:57.330
<v Speaker 4>You had to kill a wolf and you had a </v>
<v Speaker 4>gun.</v>

2534
01:48:57.680 --> 01:48:58.513
<v Speaker 4>Fricking hard real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you had to kill a deer and you had a </v>

2535
01:49:01.171 --> 01:49:02.220
<v Speaker 4>gun,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not that hard.</v>

2536
01:49:02.860 --> 01:49:05.730
<v Speaker 4>You can find deer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Finding a wolf is freaking hard,</v>

2537
01:49:05.731 --> 01:49:06.920
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So once those.</v>

2538
01:49:06.930 --> 01:49:10.500
<v Speaker 4>What my point is is once those wolf </v>
<v Speaker 4>numbers get out of hand,</v>

2539
01:49:10.800 --> 01:49:13.620
<v Speaker 4>trying to manage that population,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the wolf population is very,</v>

2540
01:49:13.621 --> 01:49:14.454
<v Speaker 4>very difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll places that are used to dealing </v>

2541
01:49:16.231 --> 01:49:17.820
<v Speaker 4>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They know what the fuck to do.</v>

2542
01:49:17.821 --> 01:49:20.450
<v Speaker 4>Like Alaska he had to them and </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything and trap them.</v>

2543
01:49:20.460 --> 01:49:23.190
<v Speaker 4>They fly around and planes and shoot </v>
<v Speaker 4>them out of the,</v>

2544
01:49:23.220 --> 01:49:26.760
<v Speaker 4>out of the air with helicopters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean they eradicate them.</v>

2545
01:49:26.800 --> 01:49:30.000
<v Speaker 4>And then that Sarah Palin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think she's doing that anymore,</v>

2546
01:49:30.240 --> 01:49:31.073
<v Speaker 4>but there's a lot of people up there </v>
<v Speaker 4>that do do that and you can buy wolf </v>

2547
01:49:34.201 --> 01:49:35.640
<v Speaker 4>skin rugs that they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

2548
01:49:35.850 --> 01:49:36.683
<v Speaker 4>they sell those skins and turn them into</v>
<v Speaker 4>rugs and do all sorts of different </v>

2549
01:49:39.781 --> 01:49:41.280
<v Speaker 4>things with the pelts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Got To do something.</v>

2550
01:49:41.340 --> 01:49:42.540
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they do something with it.</v>

2551
01:49:42.540 --> 01:49:43.373
<v Speaker 4>So it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But they do that because they have a </v>

2552
01:49:46.321 --> 01:49:47.154
<v Speaker 4>vested interest in keeping the </v>
<v Speaker 4>population of their game animals alive </v>

2553
01:49:50.080 --> 01:49:52.870
<v Speaker 4>for a couple reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's criticism about that too,</v>

2554
01:49:53.080 --> 01:49:56.140
<v Speaker 4>that they may be killed too many wolves </v>
<v Speaker 4>because they don't.</v>

2555
01:49:56.310 --> 01:50:00.460
<v Speaker 4>They want you to be able to go there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And a lot of their tourism dollars comes</v>

2556
01:50:00.461 --> 01:50:01.294
<v Speaker 4>from people that fly in to hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Moose are flying to hunt deer and they </v>

2557
01:50:03.851 --> 01:50:06.460
<v Speaker 4>want to make sure they keep certain </v>
<v Speaker 4>populations of them there.</v>

2558
01:50:06.520 --> 01:50:08.230
<v Speaker 4>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's all,</v>

2559
01:50:08.380 --> 01:50:09.213
<v Speaker 4>there's a real problem when you get </v>
<v Speaker 4>emotions and you have those emotions </v>

2560
01:50:12.370 --> 01:50:16.300
<v Speaker 4>tied into this idea of wildlife biology </v>
<v Speaker 4>and what an animal is,</v>

2561
01:50:16.301 --> 01:50:20.890
<v Speaker 4>and keeping healthy numbers of these </v>
<v Speaker 4>animals in a certain area that's a real,</v>

2562
01:50:21.070 --> 01:50:22.700
<v Speaker 4>becomes a real issue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

2563
01:50:22.750 --> 01:50:26.560
<v Speaker 4>And that's why when this goat thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>happens and everybody freaks out over,</v>

2564
01:50:26.580 --> 01:50:30.100
<v Speaker 4>it's like you should probably educate </v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself as to what you're talking about</v>

2565
01:50:30.101 --> 01:50:30.934
<v Speaker 4>before you start complaining because he </v>
<v Speaker 4>just throwing gasoline on this fire and </v>

2566
01:50:34.511 --> 01:50:37.720
<v Speaker 4>you don't necessarily understand all the</v>
<v Speaker 4>circumstances involved.</v>

2567
01:50:37.950 --> 01:50:39.200
<v Speaker 2>Let's go there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not only to because it,</v>

2568
01:50:39.580 --> 01:50:42.730
<v Speaker 2>because they live where I live and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

2569
01:50:43.060 --> 01:50:47.320
<v Speaker 2>they love shorelines and they love like </v>
<v Speaker 2>ridges and berms and stuff like that.</v>

2570
01:50:47.321 --> 01:50:48.154
<v Speaker 2>And they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

2571
01:50:48.170 --> 01:50:50.650
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they create so much erosion because they</v>

2572
01:50:50.651 --> 01:50:53.200
<v Speaker 2>love those edges on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on cliffs and stuff.</v>

2573
01:50:53.201 --> 01:50:56.010
<v Speaker 2>And so they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they ran all the berms that original.</v>

2574
01:50:56.130 --> 01:50:56.963
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they ruin all the cliffs and then </v>

2575
01:50:58.061 --> 01:51:01.510
<v Speaker 2>there's all this runoff and erosion and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2576
01:51:01.511 --> 01:51:04.150
<v Speaker 2>I mean they completely decimate all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>grass,</v>

2577
01:51:04.151 --> 01:51:05.320
<v Speaker 2>all the weeds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the way down.</v>

2578
01:51:05.321 --> 01:51:06.640
<v Speaker 2>They don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't just trim things,</v>

2579
01:51:06.641 --> 01:51:08.110
<v Speaker 2>they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not selective eaters.</v>

2580
01:51:08.380 --> 01:51:09.700
<v Speaker 2>They'll just chow down all the way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2581
01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:11.500
<v Speaker 2>to the roots and then eat the roots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>

2582
01:51:11.880 --> 01:51:13.450
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing holding that dirt in </v>
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>

2583
01:51:13.780 --> 01:51:14.613
<v Speaker 2>So when it rains,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just everything spills downhill because </v>

2584
01:51:16.331 --> 01:51:17.260
<v Speaker 2>of the goats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They really.</v>

2585
01:51:17.261 --> 01:51:18.100
<v Speaker 2>I see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see it.</v>

2586
01:51:18.320 --> 01:51:20.660
<v Speaker 2>And with deer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see some,</v>

2587
01:51:20.690 --> 01:51:24.040
<v Speaker 2>some impact that they have for sure as </v>
<v Speaker 2>you let those numbers get out of hand,</v>

2588
01:51:24.430 --> 01:51:27.040
<v Speaker 2>they have the same effect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but goats go through radical.</v>

2589
01:51:27.400 --> 01:51:29.960
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the populations explode and,</v>

2590
01:51:30.130 --> 01:51:32.590
<v Speaker 2>and if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if someone's not managing them,</v>

2591
01:51:32.591 --> 01:51:34.570
<v Speaker 2>that you can see the impact that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>have on the land</v>

2592
01:51:34.650 --> 01:51:38.280
<v Speaker 4>and that'll have an impact on all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>native species to all the ground nesting</v>

2593
01:51:38.281 --> 01:51:40.140
<v Speaker 4>birds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the animals that use that,</v>

2594
01:51:40.320 --> 01:51:44.790
<v Speaker 4>those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the grass and those different things for</v>

2595
01:51:44.791 --> 01:51:46.760
<v Speaker 4>cover and for life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2596
01:51:46.761 --> 01:51:47.700
<v Speaker 4>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>and what they,</v>

2597
01:51:47.810 --> 01:51:50.550
<v Speaker 4>the things that they feed off of all </v>
<v Speaker 4>this stuff gets eaten by the goats,</v>

2598
01:51:50.580 --> 01:51:51.190
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2599
01:51:51.190 --> 01:51:52.900
<v Speaker 2>If there's a large population of goat </v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere,</v>

2600
01:51:52.901 --> 01:51:53.850
<v Speaker 2>you'll know it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2601
01:51:54.260 --> 01:51:56.200
<v Speaker 2>That was like almost nothing left.</v>

2602
01:51:57.530 --> 01:52:00.020
<v Speaker 4>Appreciate these people like Glenn </v>
<v Speaker 4>Greenwald.</v>

2603
01:52:00.050 --> 01:52:01.970
<v Speaker 4>I appreciate the sentiment behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2604
01:52:01.971 --> 01:52:02.804
<v Speaker 4>really do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just wish they would look into it a </v>

2605
01:52:03.891 --> 01:52:06.950
<v Speaker 4>little bit deeper and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this woman's not bad person.</v>

2606
01:52:06.951 --> 01:52:08.690
<v Speaker 4>She's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's how she gets her meat,</v>

2607
01:52:09.760 --> 01:52:10.860
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

2608
01:52:11.450 --> 01:52:12.283
<v Speaker 4>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially a guy like ricky who I've </v>

2609
01:52:13.101 --> 01:52:13.510
<v Speaker 4>met,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>

2610
01:52:13.510 --> 01:52:14.343
<v Speaker 4>I've actually talked about hunting with </v>
<v Speaker 4>him on a radio show before on the open </v>

2611
01:52:18.441 --> 01:52:19.274
<v Speaker 4>anthony show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had explained to him that I'm a </v>

2612
01:52:20.151 --> 01:52:23.000
<v Speaker 4>hunter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hunt animals and I eat them because he</v>

2613
01:52:23.001 --> 01:52:23.834
<v Speaker 4>was talking about hunters and I and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>was actually very friendly with me and </v>

2614
01:52:27.081 --> 01:52:28.280
<v Speaker 4>we were cool about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We had a good.</v>

2615
01:52:28.430 --> 01:52:29.580
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as long as you eat it,</v>

2616
01:52:29.870 --> 01:52:30.980
<v Speaker 4>that's what you're doing it for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

2617
01:52:30.981 --> 01:52:33.710
<v Speaker 4>that's exactly what I do at four.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he eats me too.</v>

2618
01:52:33.711 --> 01:52:35.450
<v Speaker 4>Which is so the whole.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's weird.</v>

2619
01:52:35.900 --> 01:52:36.661
<v Speaker 4>It's the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2620
01:52:36.661 --> 01:52:37.494
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fact that people think like that </v>

2621
01:52:39.681 --> 01:52:40.514
<v Speaker 4>they are morally disconnected from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>act of killing an animal just because </v>

2622
01:52:43.941 --> 01:52:46.250
<v Speaker 4>they use a credit card to buy is so </v>
<v Speaker 4>hilarious.</v>

2623
01:52:46.490 --> 01:52:49.280
<v Speaker 3>But you hired a supermarket Hitman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what you did.</v>

2624
01:52:49.430 --> 01:52:52.730
<v Speaker 3>Supermarket Hitman took a prisoner and a</v>
<v Speaker 3>prisoner,</v>

2625
01:52:53.030 --> 01:52:56.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cow and fucking put a bolt through.</v>

2626
01:52:56.181 --> 01:52:57.200
<v Speaker 3>It said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you feel.</v>

2627
01:52:57.560 --> 01:52:59.390
<v Speaker 3>You feel completely detached from it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

2628
01:52:59.660 --> 01:53:01.430
<v Speaker 3>No Karma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2629
01:53:01.431 --> 01:53:02.264
<v Speaker 3>and when someone needs a hamburger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they think nothing of eating a quarter </v>

2630
01:53:04.551 --> 01:53:05.990
<v Speaker 3>of it or half a mil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm really full.</v>

2631
01:53:05.991 --> 01:53:07.290
<v Speaker 3>He can just take that away from me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2632
01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:09.640
<v Speaker 3>You'd never do that with your elk do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2633
01:53:09.900 --> 01:53:11.680
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I eat it all it all.</v>

2634
01:53:11.810 --> 01:53:13.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm making sure that if I cook it,</v>

2635
01:53:13.820 --> 01:53:17.510
<v Speaker 3>I Cook enough so that me and my family </v>
<v Speaker 3>eat it and whatever's leftover,</v>

2636
01:53:17.520 --> 01:53:18.050
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2637
01:53:18.050 --> 01:53:20.140
<v Speaker 3>I'll eat in the morning or eat the next </v>
<v Speaker 3>day for lunch.</v>

2638
01:53:20.250 --> 01:53:21.083
<v Speaker 3>Huge difference is you have so much </v>
<v Speaker 3>respect for that meet and for that </v>

2639
01:53:24.321 --> 01:53:25.154
<v Speaker 3>animal because all the effort it took </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you watch that thing live in the </v>

2640
01:53:27.411 --> 01:53:28.070
<v Speaker 3>wild.</v>

2641
01:53:28.070 --> 01:53:31.340
<v Speaker 3>You have a completely different </v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective of that meat then you do.</v>

2642
01:53:31.580 --> 01:53:32.740
<v Speaker 3>If you just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2643
01:53:32.750 --> 01:53:35.520
<v Speaker 3>order a hamburger at that restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2644
01:53:35.960 --> 01:53:37.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

2645
01:53:37.220 --> 01:53:38.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that,</v>

2646
01:53:39.020 --> 01:53:40.340
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's one of those,</v>

2647
01:53:40.370 --> 01:53:41.203
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you and I have developed this </v>

2648
01:53:42.081 --> 01:53:42.914
<v Speaker 3>perspective from years of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of hunting and being around people hunt </v>

2649
01:53:46.101 --> 01:53:46.934
<v Speaker 3>and we understand it for the average </v>
<v Speaker 3>person that's never going to encounter </v>

2650
01:53:50.181 --> 01:53:51.860
<v Speaker 3>that in their entire life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now it's,</v>

2651
01:53:52.130 --> 01:53:56.270
<v Speaker 3>we've developed this very weird society.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have insulated people from all of the</v>

2652
01:53:56.271 --> 01:53:59.930
<v Speaker 3>ugly realities of eating meat and of </v>
<v Speaker 3>wearing leather.</v>

2653
01:53:59.960 --> 01:54:01.460
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're sitting on leather chairs.</v>

2654
01:54:01.461 --> 01:54:03.980
<v Speaker 3>Didn't think about it once.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This used to be a fucking cow.</v>

2655
01:54:04.020 --> 01:54:04.853
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's some a shot this cow and turns it </v>

2656
01:54:06.471 --> 01:54:07.304
<v Speaker 3>into a nice chair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one minds sitting on a cow that's </v>

2657
01:54:10.311 --> 01:54:11.144
<v Speaker 3>dead,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but no one wants to see that dead cow </v>

2658
01:54:13.200 --> 01:54:14.033
<v Speaker 3>laying on the ground.</v>

2659
01:54:14.180 --> 01:54:17.860
<v Speaker 3>The eyes open and blood hanging from his</v>
<v Speaker 3>ankles people,</v>

2660
01:54:17.900 --> 01:54:19.970
<v Speaker 3>and I think it's important for people to</v>
<v Speaker 3>see that.</v>

2661
01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.340
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my kids have seen a lot of dead animals.</v>

2662
01:54:23.410 --> 01:54:25.160
<v Speaker 3>It's not sad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a little sad,</v>

2663
01:54:25.161 --> 01:54:27.020
<v Speaker 3>but it's not like they don't think of it</v>
<v Speaker 3>as sad.</v>

2664
01:54:27.021 --> 01:54:30.560
<v Speaker 3>They think of it as just like a part of </v>
<v Speaker 3>life and that's what we eat.</v>

2665
01:54:30.650 --> 01:54:34.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dad brings a deer home in a cooler.</v>

2666
01:54:34.460 --> 01:54:37.310
<v Speaker 3>Dad brings a pig home in the front of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the quad with his bow,</v>

2667
01:54:37.400 --> 01:54:39.530
<v Speaker 3>with a buddy earl.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's totally normal.</v>

2668
01:54:39.590 --> 01:54:40.423
<v Speaker 3>They see me drag it off the quad and </v>
<v Speaker 3>shoot down with the hose and quarter it </v>

2669
01:54:43.391 --> 01:54:44.224
<v Speaker 3>and debone it and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they help me package it and grind </v>

2670
01:54:46.180 --> 01:54:49.700
<v Speaker 3>immedion's totally normal to them it </v>
<v Speaker 3>should be normal,</v>

2671
01:54:50.030 --> 01:54:53.000
<v Speaker 3>but there's a connection between the </v>
<v Speaker 3>death and what we're eating,</v>

2672
01:54:53.780 --> 01:54:56.060
<v Speaker 3>which a lot of people just don't have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I love that.</v>

2673
01:54:56.061 --> 01:54:58.040
<v Speaker 3>That to my kids already have that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a good thing.</v>

2674
01:54:58.041 --> 01:54:58.880
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2675
01:54:58.881 --> 01:54:59.714
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that we have a real problem in </v>

2676
01:55:00.921 --> 01:55:01.754
<v Speaker 3>this society where so many people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere in the neighborhood of 95 to </v>

2677
01:55:04.491 --> 01:55:05.324
<v Speaker 3>97 percent of the people you meet and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the number of people that have actually </v>

2678
01:55:07.701 --> 01:55:09.170
<v Speaker 3>seen animal die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2679
01:55:09.250 --> 01:55:11.690
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two or three like what is the,</v>

2680
01:55:11.960 --> 01:55:14.810
<v Speaker 3>what's the population of people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>hunt in North America?</v>

2681
01:55:15.140 --> 01:55:19.100
<v Speaker 3>Let's just guess,</v>
<v Speaker 3>guess the prop population of the US that</v>

2682
01:55:19.101 --> 01:55:20.840
<v Speaker 3>hunts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to say it's</v>

2683
01:55:22.520 --> 01:55:25.070
<v Speaker 3>three percent that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that might be high.</v>

2684
01:55:25.071 --> 01:55:27.770
<v Speaker 3>Even three out of 100.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you think it is?</v>

2685
01:55:28.460 --> 01:55:31.640
<v Speaker 3>It's probably less than three for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's see what it is.</v>

2686
01:55:33.550 --> 01:55:34.383
<v Speaker 3>What population of the United States of </v>
<v Speaker 3>America hunts Jamie's raising his </v>

2687
01:55:37.421 --> 01:55:39.100
<v Speaker 3>eyebrows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2688
01:55:39.110 --> 01:55:43.110
<v Speaker 3>It might be it set on technicality here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it says there's 100,</v>

2689
01:55:43.200 --> 01:55:44.670
<v Speaker 3>one point 6 million</v>

2690
01:55:44.670 --> 01:55:48.890
<v Speaker 1>Americans that have participated 16 and </v>
<v Speaker 1>older that uh,</v>

2691
01:55:48.900 --> 01:55:49.733
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fishing fish and wildlife shows that </v>

2692
01:55:51.331 --> 01:55:52.370
<v Speaker 1>100,</v>
<v Speaker 1>$100.</v>

2693
01:55:52.410 --> 01:55:55.110
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people behind you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that must have painted.</v>

2694
01:55:55.220 --> 01:55:56.053
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Participated in wildlife related </v>

2695
01:55:56.851 --> 01:55:58.350
<v Speaker 1>activities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

2696
01:55:58.351 --> 01:55:59.380
<v Speaker 1>That's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

2697
01:55:59.640 --> 01:56:02.160
<v Speaker 1>that includes like pig fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That includes wildlife watching.</v>

2698
01:56:03.110 --> 01:56:04.310
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wildlife watch it.</v>

2699
01:56:04.311 --> 01:56:06.620
<v Speaker 1>And I typed in popular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's definitely a lot of difference.</v>

2700
01:56:07.110 --> 01:56:08.770
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2701
01:56:08.970 --> 01:56:10.260
<v Speaker 1>does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all they came up.</v>

2702
01:56:10.350 --> 01:56:13.000
<v Speaker 1>There's got to be a population of actual</v>
<v Speaker 1>number of hunters.</v>

2703
01:56:13.020 --> 01:56:14.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is back in.</v>

2704
01:56:15.450 --> 01:56:17.250
<v Speaker 2>That's the other thing too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is like there's a hierarchy,</v>

2705
01:56:17.251 --> 01:56:19.080
<v Speaker 2>like people don't have a problem with </v>
<v Speaker 2>people fishing.</v>

2706
01:56:19.420 --> 01:56:20.460
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2707
01:56:20.490 --> 01:56:21.323
<v Speaker 2>no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or posting a photo with their fishing </v>

2708
01:56:22.951 --> 01:56:24.030
<v Speaker 2>pole and catch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2709
01:56:24.031 --> 01:56:25.020
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got some food.</v>

2710
01:56:25.021 --> 01:56:25.854
<v Speaker 2>What's different between that present?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's what's the difference </v>

2711
01:56:28.951 --> 01:56:30.780
<v Speaker 2>between now and a deer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but here's,</v>

2712
01:56:30.781 --> 01:56:32.940
<v Speaker 2>there's a warm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the will.</v>

2713
01:56:33.090 --> 01:56:35.990
<v Speaker 2>They're warm and they have for a movie </v>
<v Speaker 2>made about them.</v>

2714
01:56:36.080 --> 01:56:37.200
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they talk.</v>

2715
01:56:37.260 --> 01:56:39.150
<v Speaker 2>What about Nemos fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nimo.</v>

2716
01:56:39.180 --> 01:56:44.180
<v Speaker 2>Nobody cares about finding nemo gets no </v>
<v Speaker 2>love.</v>

2717
01:56:45.060 --> 01:56:46.800
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't get any less.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking of this though,</v>

2718
01:56:46.801 --> 01:56:47.550
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2719
01:56:47.550 --> 01:56:49.470
<v Speaker 2>because I have kids and my kids eat </v>
<v Speaker 2>meat.</v>

2720
01:56:49.800 --> 01:56:50.633
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I feel like imagine if you made a </v>

2721
01:56:51.841 --> 01:56:54.960
<v Speaker 2>law that after the age of 16 years old </v>
<v Speaker 2>in America,</v>

2722
01:56:55.200 --> 01:56:56.700
<v Speaker 2>if you want her to eat another </v>
<v Speaker 2>hamburger,</v>

2723
01:56:57.180 --> 01:56:59.010
<v Speaker 2>you had to kill two hours to two </v>
<v Speaker 2>animals.</v>

2724
01:57:00.450 --> 01:57:02.730
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you can go to a place like whatever</v>

2725
01:57:02.731 --> 01:57:03.564
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a of a ranch where they processed </v>

2726
01:57:04.911 --> 01:57:07.890
<v Speaker 2>me and there's a cow there and there's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>rifle there and you go,</v>

2727
01:57:07.891 --> 01:57:08.724
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to be a meat eater from now </v>

2728
01:57:09.481 --> 01:57:10.980
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from their 60th birthday on,</v>

2729
01:57:11.370 --> 01:57:15.000
<v Speaker 2>the only way to eat meat in the future </v>
<v Speaker 2>is if you got to do it yourself at least</v>

2730
01:57:15.001 --> 01:57:15.390
<v Speaker 2>twice.</v>

2731
01:57:15.390 --> 01:57:17.250
<v Speaker 2>Can't just do it once now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kill a cow,</v>

2732
01:57:17.700 --> 01:57:18.690
<v Speaker 2>watch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get processed,</v>

2733
01:57:18.960 --> 01:57:21.210
<v Speaker 2>and then you got to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to wait like a month or whatever</v>

2734
01:57:21.211 --> 01:57:23.640
<v Speaker 2>it is and go back and take another </v>
<v Speaker 2>animal's life.</v>

2735
01:57:24.030 --> 01:57:26.160
<v Speaker 2>And then you earn the right to eat meat </v>
<v Speaker 2>the rest of your life.</v>

2736
01:57:26.161 --> 01:57:28.530
<v Speaker 2>Imagine how many people wouldn't be able</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do that.</v>

2737
01:57:29.100 --> 01:57:29.933
<v Speaker 2>They're happy to eat meat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's that disconnection with the </v>

2738
01:57:32.011 --> 01:57:32.970
<v Speaker 2>actual death part</v>

2739
01:57:34.670 --> 01:57:35.503
<v Speaker 1>problem with forcing people to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like got to have a problem with </v>

2740
01:57:37.671 --> 01:57:42.671
<v Speaker 1>forcing people to think people should be</v>
<v Speaker 1>forced to get rid of their garbage.</v>

2741
01:57:42.770 --> 01:57:45.290
<v Speaker 1>It's just a wild concept that it is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting concept,</v>

2742
01:57:45.500 --> 01:57:50.120
<v Speaker 1>but I think there's services like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like taking your garbage and bring it to</v>

2743
01:57:50.121 --> 01:57:50.954
<v Speaker 1>the garbage dump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you should have to go to </v>

2744
01:57:53.541 --> 01:57:56.510
<v Speaker 1>the garbage dump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to the landfill and drop your garbage</v>

2745
01:57:56.511 --> 01:57:57.370
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

2746
01:57:57.371 --> 01:57:58.204
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy that there's someone that gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>paid to pick up the bins and dumped the </v>

2747
01:58:01.461 --> 01:58:02.294
<v Speaker 1>garbage into the garbage truck and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>drive it to the bit that I'm happy that </v>

2748
01:58:05.271 --> 01:58:06.980
<v Speaker 1>that exists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked that.</v>

2749
01:58:07.610 --> 01:58:09.770
<v Speaker 1>I liked the fact that someone takes care</v>
<v Speaker 1>of your sewage.</v>

2750
01:58:10.430 --> 01:58:13.270
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like the fact that I can buy a steak</v>

2751
01:58:14.210 --> 01:58:15.710
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All I'm saying is like,</v>

2752
01:58:15.740 --> 01:58:16.573
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you could earn the right to eat </v>

2753
01:58:17.691 --> 01:58:19.520
<v Speaker 2>steak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2754
01:58:20.090 --> 01:58:21.740
<v Speaker 2>say you have to do it every time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't.</v>

2755
01:58:21.741 --> 01:58:24.710
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't have to like kill a cow </v>
<v Speaker 2>every time you learn to eat more.</v>

2756
01:58:24.711 --> 01:58:27.120
<v Speaker 2>It's like once you finish that cal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to kill another one.</v>

2757
01:58:27.121 --> 01:58:30.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying everyone should know </v>
<v Speaker 2>what it's like to take an animal's life.</v>

2758
01:58:30.950 --> 01:58:32.360
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you to eat meat.</v>

2759
01:58:32.450 --> 01:58:33.283
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone should probably know what it's </v>

2760
01:58:34.011 --> 01:58:36.140
<v Speaker 2>like because.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if you don't,</v>

2761
01:58:36.200 --> 01:58:38.590
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to respect that animal enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2762
01:58:38.630 --> 01:58:39.680
<v Speaker 2>like I was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like my,</v>

2763
01:58:39.710 --> 01:58:40.910
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my kids don't.</v>

2764
01:58:41.410 --> 01:58:41.980
<v Speaker 2>We don't</v>

2765
01:58:41.980 --> 01:58:44.170
<v Speaker 3>waste deer meat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if it's on their plate,</v>

2766
01:58:44.171 --> 01:58:45.310
<v Speaker 3>they eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they don't eat it,</v>

2767
01:58:45.311 --> 01:58:47.110
<v Speaker 3>I put it in there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eat it next day or whatever it is.</v>

2768
01:58:47.111 --> 01:58:47.830
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

2769
01:58:47.830 --> 01:58:48.663
<v Speaker 3>there's always a lesson to be to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>taught when you're eating wild gained </v>

2770
01:58:50.801 --> 01:58:52.480
<v Speaker 3>that you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you've hunted yourself.</v>

2771
01:58:52.481 --> 01:58:53.314
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well I think there's a problem whenever </v>

2772
01:58:54.701 --> 01:58:56.110
<v Speaker 3>there's a disconnect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2773
01:58:56.530 --> 01:58:57.363
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a problem with if money </v>

2774
01:58:59.441 --> 01:59:03.300
<v Speaker 3>just comes for free,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a problem with your meat.</v>

2775
01:59:03.310 --> 01:59:04.660
<v Speaker 3>Just comes from a store,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it?</v>

2776
01:59:04.780 --> 01:59:05.613
<v Speaker 3>There's a weird disconnect between the </v>
<v Speaker 3>actual thing that's living and then </v>

2777
01:59:09.761 --> 01:59:10.594
<v Speaker 3>eating it and most people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the vast majority of people are </v>

2778
01:59:14.141 --> 01:59:14.974
<v Speaker 3>completely disconnected from that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that's all that's the case with </v>

2779
01:59:17.861 --> 01:59:18.694
<v Speaker 3>farming vegetables to most people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they have an appreciation </v>

2780
01:59:22.181 --> 01:59:24.710
<v Speaker 3>for vegetable being a life form.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>

2781
01:59:25.300 --> 01:59:26.740
<v Speaker 3>you're consuming that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2782
01:59:26.741 --> 01:59:27.940
<v Speaker 3>there's a growth process.</v>

2783
01:59:27.940 --> 01:59:30.400
<v Speaker 3>It's a living thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He pulled it out of the ground.</v>

2784
01:59:30.430 --> 01:59:31.480
<v Speaker 3>You Cook it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you eat it.</v>

2785
01:59:31.540 --> 01:59:32.373
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this disconnect I think is real too </v>

2786
01:59:34.630 --> 01:59:35.463
<v Speaker 3>because there's a real good feeling that</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get when I eat vegetables that have </v>

2787
01:59:37.871 --> 01:59:39.690
<v Speaker 3>grown in my garden,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2788
01:59:39.700 --> 01:59:40.570
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>

2789
01:59:40.571 --> 01:59:41.870
<v Speaker 3>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really enjoy it.</v>

2790
01:59:41.871 --> 01:59:42.704
<v Speaker 3>I get a kick out of it and there's a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>of people who look down on us for </v>

2791
01:59:44.801 --> 01:59:48.580
<v Speaker 3>hunting who are say like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a Vegan who just eats nothing but</v>

2792
01:59:48.581 --> 01:59:50.500
<v Speaker 3>vegetables and fruit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is.</v>

2793
01:59:50.620 --> 01:59:52.090
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2794
01:59:52.100 --> 01:59:53.740
<v Speaker 3>they're looking at us like we're crazy </v>
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

2795
01:59:54.280 --> 01:59:55.113
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2796
01:59:55.480 --> 01:59:57.670
<v Speaker 3>the impact we have on the animals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>killing them,</v>

2797
01:59:57.680 --> 01:59:58.513
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like a lot of the vegetables that </v>

2798
01:59:59.801 --> 02:00:03.640
<v Speaker 3>people eat nowadays are grown in places </v>
<v Speaker 3>that used to be rainforest,</v>

2799
02:00:04.060 --> 02:00:06.670
<v Speaker 3>like the Amazon just getting whacked </v>
<v Speaker 3>down just to grow corn,</v>

2800
02:00:07.090 --> 02:00:07.780
<v Speaker 3>stuff like that.</v>

2801
02:00:07.780 --> 02:00:10.300
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a lot of it is just cattle,</v>

2802
02:00:10.301 --> 02:00:11.134
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that Amazon a lot of the </v>

2803
02:00:11.590 --> 02:00:14.200
<v Speaker 3>deforestation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that the primary,</v>

2804
02:00:14.620 --> 02:00:17.680
<v Speaker 3>a lot of ethanol to though isn't for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for corn,</v>

2805
02:00:17.800 --> 02:00:21.100
<v Speaker 3>you know there's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think hardwoods,</v>

2806
02:00:21.380 --> 02:00:22.213
<v Speaker 3>the chopped a lot of it down for </v>
<v Speaker 3>hardwoods and they dropped a lot of it </v>

2807
02:00:24.131 --> 02:00:27.970
<v Speaker 3>down to in order to provide grazing </v>
<v Speaker 3>lands for cattle.</v>

2808
02:00:28.140 --> 02:00:28.973
<v Speaker 3>They going the future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of the vegetables and stuff we're </v>

2809
02:00:29.831 --> 02:00:31.510
<v Speaker 3>going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was talking to Kelly about this a lot.</v>

2810
02:00:31.570 --> 02:00:32.403
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of things that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>happening now with technology that I </v>

2811
02:00:35.381 --> 02:00:36.214
<v Speaker 3>think a lot of like the vegetables and </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff that we're going to eating or </v>

2812
02:00:38.291 --> 02:00:39.124
<v Speaker 3>going to be grown vertically instead of </v>
<v Speaker 3>on these massive farms have like these </v>

2813
02:00:44.020 --> 02:00:45.940
<v Speaker 3>huge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like 100,000</v>

2814
02:00:45.941 --> 02:00:46.774
<v Speaker 3>Acre ranch is full of vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all gonna be grown like in smaller </v>

2815
02:00:49.541 --> 02:00:51.130
<v Speaker 3>spaces,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2816
02:00:51.250 --> 02:00:52.083
<v Speaker 3>super,</v>
<v Speaker 3>super efficient growing and smaller </v>

2817
02:00:53.561 --> 02:00:55.990
<v Speaker 3>spaces to feed more people with less </v>
<v Speaker 3>space.</v>

2818
02:00:56.650 --> 02:00:59.590
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if they could do be crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's gonna be crazy.</v>

2819
02:00:59.980 --> 02:01:01.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would be crazy.</v>

2820
02:01:01.420 --> 02:01:03.430
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's probably some real </v>
<v Speaker 3>benefits to that,</v>

2821
02:01:03.431 --> 02:01:04.990
<v Speaker 3>but I wonder if they could do that with </v>
<v Speaker 3>grain.</v>

2822
02:01:05.170 --> 02:01:06.003
<v Speaker 3>We're going to have to do something with</v>
<v Speaker 3>our population keeping growing and more </v>

2823
02:01:09.071 --> 02:01:13.210
<v Speaker 3>people and more demand for food and less</v>
<v Speaker 3>space to grow it.</v>

2824
02:01:13.300 --> 02:01:14.133
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's gonna be an inflection point </v>

2825
02:01:14.921 --> 02:01:16.480
<v Speaker 3>where somebody's going to have to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

2826
02:01:16.660 --> 02:01:18.670
<v Speaker 3>But I think technology is moving in that</v>
<v Speaker 3>place where.</v>

2827
02:01:19.350 --> 02:01:20.590
<v Speaker 3>And that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2828
02:01:20.591 --> 02:01:21.424
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I fully get like the people who hate on </v>

2829
02:01:22.661 --> 02:01:24.300
<v Speaker 3>me on say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>social media,</v>

2830
02:01:24.310 --> 02:01:26.650
<v Speaker 3>whatever on my instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I post a photo of my,</v>

2831
02:01:26.890 --> 02:01:27.723
<v Speaker 3>if I did post a photo of me getting an </v>
<v Speaker 3>elk or whatever it was and all these </v>

2832
02:01:30.760 --> 02:01:32.500
<v Speaker 3>people get uppity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

2833
02:01:33.790 --> 02:01:35.170
<v Speaker 3>because a lot of people can't go </v>
<v Speaker 3>hunting.</v>

2834
02:01:35.170 --> 02:01:38.470
<v Speaker 3>I don't live in a place where they can </v>
<v Speaker 3>go hunting and get their own meat.</v>

2835
02:01:38.471 --> 02:01:39.304
<v Speaker 3>They live in a city,</v>
<v Speaker 3>live in New York City or Shanghai or </v>

2836
02:01:41.150 --> 02:01:43.910
<v Speaker 3>Buenos Aires or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they did so unrelatable to them,</v>

2837
02:01:43.911 --> 02:01:44.820
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2838
02:01:44.840 --> 02:01:46.160
<v Speaker 3>I understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I appreciate that.</v>

2839
02:01:46.400 --> 02:01:47.233
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that social media is very </v>

2840
02:01:49.221 --> 02:01:50.054
<v Speaker 3>strange in that regard too because </v>
<v Speaker 3>people are always looking for people or </v>

2841
02:01:52.671 --> 02:01:54.000
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get pissed off out.</v>

2842
02:01:54.050 --> 02:01:56.180
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't get mad if I post pictures of</v>

2843
02:01:56.210 --> 02:01:57.620
<v Speaker 3>cooking though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2844
02:01:57.830 --> 02:01:59.390
<v Speaker 3>they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean a few.</v>

2845
02:01:59.420 --> 02:02:01.630
<v Speaker 3>There's a few like proselytize very </v>
<v Speaker 3>games.</v>

2846
02:02:01.880 --> 02:02:03.640
<v Speaker 3>You're going to get cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2847
02:02:03.680 --> 02:02:06.650
<v Speaker 3>There was one of the alleys do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think cancer comes from meat.</v>

2848
02:02:06.860 --> 02:02:09.680
<v Speaker 3>He if all meet gabby cancer now fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>stupid.</v>

2849
02:02:09.681 --> 02:02:10.514
<v Speaker 3>That is everyone would have cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like literally 95 percent of the </v>

2850
02:02:13.071 --> 02:02:17.960
<v Speaker 3>population with cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's a few epidemiological studies</v>

2851
02:02:17.961 --> 02:02:21.650
<v Speaker 3>that have fuck people's heads up because</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've Kerr corresponded.</v>

2852
02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:25.490
<v Speaker 3>They're related.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea of eating meat to poor health,</v>

2853
02:02:25.760 --> 02:02:28.610
<v Speaker 3>but these people that have eaten meat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't just eat meat.</v>

2854
02:02:28.790 --> 02:02:32.790
<v Speaker 3>They've eaten meat along with sugar and </v>
<v Speaker 3>alcohol consumption.</v>

2855
02:02:32.810 --> 02:02:33.643
<v Speaker 3>Cigarettes and lifestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't factor those things in there </v>

2856
02:02:36.600 --> 02:02:37.600
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>

2857
02:02:37.730 --> 02:02:41.720
<v Speaker 3>like a 30 ounce prime rib.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your body is impossible for your body to</v>

2858
02:02:41.721 --> 02:02:42.554
<v Speaker 3>process that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like more likely they're eating burgers </v>

2859
02:02:44.300 --> 02:02:47.880
<v Speaker 3>with sugary bonds and processed meat and</v>
<v Speaker 3>bullshit.</v>

2860
02:02:47.900 --> 02:02:49.980
<v Speaker 3>When I eat meat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I normally meet the.</v>

2861
02:02:50.060 --> 02:02:52.280
<v Speaker 3>That's like the size of my palm or a </v>
<v Speaker 3>smaller,</v>

2862
02:02:52.670 --> 02:02:54.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eight wild game and it's that size.</v>

2863
02:02:54.950 --> 02:02:56.690
<v Speaker 3>I think it's easy for my body to process</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2864
02:02:57.080 --> 02:02:59.720
<v Speaker 3>Eating like a prime rib that's hanging </v>
<v Speaker 3>off both sides of your plate,</v>

2865
02:02:59.721 --> 02:03:00.554
<v Speaker 3>like Fred Flintstone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's difficult I think for your body </v>

2866
02:03:02.511 --> 02:03:03.930
<v Speaker 3>to process that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just got it.</v>

2867
02:03:04.060 --> 02:03:06.350
<v Speaker 3>That's not scientific.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just look at it and go,</v>

2868
02:03:06.351 --> 02:03:07.190
<v Speaker 3>there's no way I can.</v>

2869
02:03:07.400 --> 02:03:09.410
<v Speaker 3>My body's going to deal with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where's it going to fit?</v>

2870
02:03:09.470 --> 02:03:11.420
<v Speaker 3>It's going to stay in it for 30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

2871
02:03:11.421 --> 02:03:13.670
<v Speaker 3>They always say that it's going to stay </v>
<v Speaker 3>true to.</v>

2872
02:03:14.300 --> 02:03:16.910
<v Speaker 3>That's all nonsense to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wasn't Kelly's talking about like,</v>

2873
02:03:17.460 --> 02:03:20.410
<v Speaker 3>are they shooting his butt out and </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff?</v>

2874
02:03:22.130 --> 02:03:23.830
<v Speaker 3>He was talking about talk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2875
02:03:23.840 --> 02:03:24.673
<v Speaker 3>he was talking about um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you go on these extreme fasts and </v>

2876
02:03:28.371 --> 02:03:32.540
<v Speaker 3>then all this weird stuff that comes out</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the inside of your gut comes out.</v>

2877
02:03:32.780 --> 02:03:33.613
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would try that just to look at that </v>

2878
02:03:35.361 --> 02:03:36.980
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see what this stuff looks like.</v>

2879
02:03:37.370 --> 02:03:38.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would try it,</v>

2880
02:03:38.421 --> 02:03:40.100
<v Speaker 3>but I wouldn't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't want to look at it.</v>

2881
02:03:40.101 --> 02:03:41.690
<v Speaker 3>I definitely would want like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the,</v>

2882
02:03:41.770 --> 02:03:42.603
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when like when you have a baby and they </v>

2883
02:03:43.011 --> 02:03:46.040
<v Speaker 3>put up like a curtain sometime to see </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything like that.</v>

2884
02:03:46.041 --> 02:03:46.400
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2885
02:03:46.400 --> 02:03:47.570
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to put my legs up.</v>

2886
02:03:47.580 --> 02:03:52.580
<v Speaker 3>Someone's got a visual of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cut my legs up and somebody,</v>

2887
02:03:53.540 --> 02:03:56.600
<v Speaker 3>someone out there doing all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You grow your own vegetables.</v>

2888
02:03:56.630 --> 02:03:59.450
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I travel half the time.</v>

2889
02:03:59.570 --> 02:04:01.880
<v Speaker 3>I'm gone from home like literally half </v>
<v Speaker 3>the time.</v>

2890
02:04:01.881 --> 02:04:02.714
<v Speaker 3>So it's really difficult to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it hard getting good vegetables on </v>

2891
02:04:05.061 --> 02:04:07.250
<v Speaker 3>the Big Island?</v>

<v Speaker 3>it's actually really easy.</v>

2894
02:04:10.911 --> 02:04:13.450
<v Speaker 3>It was really good farmer's markets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm lucky because my,</v>

2895
02:04:13.690 --> 02:04:16.130

<v Speaker 3>neat,</v>

2896
02:04:16.131 --> 02:04:18.650
<v Speaker 3>like a hydroponic killer vegetable </v>
<v Speaker 3>garden.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's cool.</v>

2904
02:04:33.590 --> 02:04:37.830
<v Speaker 3>I love Zan has a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's got a macadamia farm</v>

2905
02:04:38.040 --> 02:04:41.160
<v Speaker 4>on the big island and she raves about it</v>
<v Speaker 4>up there.</v>

2906
02:04:41.161 --> 02:04:42.090
<v Speaker 4>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she loves it.</v>

2907
02:04:42.400 --> 02:04:45.280
<v Speaker 2>I listened to part of her podcast if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't finished it yet,</v>

2908
02:04:45.880 --> 02:04:47.350
<v Speaker 2>but she's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's funny.</v>

2909
02:04:47.380 --> 02:04:47.980
<v Speaker 2>She's,</v>

2910
02:04:47.980 --> 02:04:49.750
<v Speaker 4>you know what man?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They fucked up.</v>

2911
02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.820
<v Speaker 4>They really did fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They fucked up when they blew it on.</v>

2912
02:04:52.960 --> 02:04:56.230
<v Speaker 4>That lady is not racist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's definitely mentally ill,</v>

2913
02:04:56.320 --> 02:04:59.600
<v Speaker 4>but she's open about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's not racist and they,</v>

2914
02:04:59.601 --> 02:05:00.434
<v Speaker 4>they just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they just jumped on the opportunity to </v>

2915
02:05:02.021 --> 02:05:06.430
<v Speaker 4>virtue signal and to cry out against </v>
<v Speaker 4>racism and to take a stand.</v>

2916
02:05:06.880 --> 02:05:09.550
<v Speaker 4>But they took a stand against a woman </v>
<v Speaker 4>that has mental problems,</v>

2917
02:05:09.551 --> 02:05:12.010
<v Speaker 4>who's on all sorts of medication?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who they knew about it.</v>

2918
02:05:12.410 --> 02:05:13.243
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's been.</v>

2919
02:05:13.600 --> 02:05:18.600
<v Speaker 4>She was put in a mental hospital for </v>
<v Speaker 4>nine months when she was a kid and she's</v>

2920
02:05:18.700 --> 02:05:22.690
<v Speaker 4>hit by a car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean she had a severe brain injury and</v>

2921
02:05:22.691 --> 02:05:25.420
<v Speaker 4>ever since then she's had multiple </v>
<v Speaker 4>personality disorder.</v>

2922
02:05:25.421 --> 02:05:28.540
<v Speaker 4>She's been on a host of different </v>
<v Speaker 4>medications and they knew about this.</v>

2923
02:05:28.630 --> 02:05:31.070
<v Speaker 4>Everybody knew about this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They should have known that.</v>

2924
02:05:31.140 --> 02:05:31.973
<v Speaker 4>It's basically like taking a person </v>
<v Speaker 4>who's got a broken leg and getting mad </v>

2925
02:05:34.661 --> 02:05:35.494
<v Speaker 4>that they limp.</v>

2926
02:05:36.230 --> 02:05:37.180
<v Speaker 4>It's what they did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2927
02:05:37.300 --> 02:05:40.480
<v Speaker 4>I mean they have a person who had brain </v>
<v Speaker 4>problems who,</v>

2928
02:05:40.510 --> 02:05:44.560
<v Speaker 4>who tweets a bunch of wacky shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's on Ambien and drinking and smoking</v>

2929
02:05:44.561 --> 02:05:47.320
<v Speaker 4>pot and even then she wasn't being </v>
<v Speaker 4>racist.</v>

2930
02:05:47.350 --> 02:05:49.450
<v Speaker 4>She wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She didn't know that lady was black.</v>

2931
02:05:49.630 --> 02:05:51.670
<v Speaker 4>The lady didn't even look black.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you look at her,</v>

2932
02:05:51.940 --> 02:05:54.250
<v Speaker 4>you look at a picture of her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She does not look black.</v>

2933
02:05:55.210 --> 02:05:58.840
<v Speaker 4>She just thought she was being funny and</v>
<v Speaker 4>she thought she was making a solid point</v>

2934
02:05:58.841 --> 02:05:59.674
<v Speaker 4>that she was going to expand upon what </v>
<v Speaker 4>you woke up in the morning as she </v>

2935
02:06:01.901 --> 02:06:02.734

<v Speaker 4>pot and drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I listened to as crazy.</v>

2937
02:06:07.150 --> 02:06:07.871
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2948
02:06:35.580 --> 02:06:36.413
<v Speaker 2>they kept asking her if she was black </v>
<v Speaker 2>and she would just straight up like at </v>

2949
02:06:39.121 --> 02:06:39.954
<v Speaker 2>first she said yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then she said like it's not that </v>

2950
02:06:41.701 --> 02:06:42.534
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then she was like tanning herself </v>

2951
02:06:44.401 --> 02:06:45.234
<v Speaker 2>and like putting all this brown on </v>

2952
02:06:50.521 --> 02:06:51.354

<v Speaker 2>like how she thought like black people </v>

2953
02:06:53.461 --> 02:06:55.860
<v Speaker 2>would do their nails.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it was super weird.</v>

2954
02:06:55.861 --> 02:06:58.410
<v Speaker 2>And then she ran.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>huge impact.</v>

2958
02:07:09.121 --> 02:07:11.660
<v Speaker 2>She was like amazing at her job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Supposedly in the,</v>

2959
02:07:11.800 --> 02:07:12.633
<v Speaker 2>in the documentary is saying that she </v>
<v Speaker 2>got all this stuff done at that they </v>

2961
02:07:16.951 --> 02:07:17.784
<v Speaker 2>really good at doing her job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just sucked that she was actually a </v>

<v Speaker 2>white lady who was acting the whole </v>

02:07:36.100 --> 02:07:37.990
<v Speaker 1>their title.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're leaving in weird times.</v>

2969
02:07:37.991 --> 02:07:42.991
<v Speaker 1>Men can say people of Color,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is fucking bizarre.</v>

2970
02:07:43.210 --> 02:07:46.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't say colored people as well.</v>

2971
02:07:46.081 --> 02:07:49.690
<v Speaker 1>You can say people of color.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same words just twisted around.</v>

2972
02:07:49.960 --> 02:07:50.870
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a um,</v>

2973
02:07:50.950 --> 02:07:54.280
<v Speaker 1>it's messed up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you can just be like labeled a</v>

2974
02:07:54.281 --> 02:07:56.950
<v Speaker 1>racist or sexist or whatever for like </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying like,</v>

2975
02:07:57.400 --> 02:07:58.370
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2976
02:07:58.371 --> 02:07:59.490
<v Speaker 1>that's wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2977
02:07:59.500 --> 02:08:03.640
<v Speaker 1>I had a 23 and me DNA tests done and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're pretty good.</v>

2978
02:08:03.670 --> 02:08:05.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was hoping I was.</v>

2979
02:08:05.830 --> 02:08:08.910
<v Speaker 1>If I was more than 10 percent black,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to start dropping bombs,</v>

2980
02:08:09.460 --> 02:08:13.360
<v Speaker 1>but a one point six.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one point six,</v>

2981
02:08:13.480 --> 02:08:16.300
<v Speaker 1>one point six percent African,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty strong,</v>

2982
02:08:16.390 --> 02:08:18.370
<v Speaker 1>it's all Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

2983
02:08:19.970 --> 02:08:22.660
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they did that thing about Elizabeth</v>

2984
02:08:22.660 --> 02:08:24.580
<v Speaker 1>Warren,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did find out what percentage.</v>

2985
02:08:24.700 --> 02:08:29.650
<v Speaker 1>She is a Elizabeth Warren who claim to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be native American and she did a test,</v>

2986
02:08:29.890 --> 02:08:33.460
<v Speaker 1>she's like one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

2987
02:08:33.550 --> 02:08:38.550
<v Speaker 1>100th of what I am like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's literally like her saying she's,</v>

2988
02:08:39.011 --> 02:08:39.844
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her saying she's a native American is </v>

2989
02:08:43.031 --> 02:08:48.031
<v Speaker 1>literally like me saying I'm African </v>
<v Speaker 1>American but I have more of a claim,</v>

2990
02:08:48.830 --> 02:08:53.080
<v Speaker 1>have far more like more than I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>

2991
02:08:53.200 --> 02:08:54.033
<v Speaker 1>some insane number,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a factor of more African in me and </v>

2992
02:09:00.281 --> 02:09:04.180
<v Speaker 1>she has native American and I'm not even</v>
<v Speaker 1>remotely native American.</v>

2993
02:09:04.690 --> 02:09:05.930
<v Speaker 1>Remotely African.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2994
02:09:06.510 --> 02:09:07.343
<v Speaker 1>I'm one point six percent of one point </v>
<v Speaker 1>six percent African in me and she has </v>

2995
02:09:11.020 --> 02:09:15.720
<v Speaker 1>like some fucking really stupid number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the dump?</v>

2996
02:09:16.080 --> 02:09:16.913
<v Speaker 1>It's like point zero zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know how to make sense of </v>

2997
02:09:20.471 --> 02:09:21.304
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff she had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was what happened was a harvard </v>

2998
02:09:25.930 --> 02:09:29.530
<v Speaker 1>researcher looked into it and gave a </v>
<v Speaker 1>number that was very vague.</v>

2999
02:09:29.531 --> 02:09:34.531
<v Speaker 1>That would be like one and 500,</v>
<v Speaker 1>12 to one and 1020 fourth,</v>

3000
02:09:36.370 --> 02:09:37.660
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sucks.</v>

3001
02:09:37.760 --> 02:09:41.080
<v Speaker 1>It sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sucks that that's the thing,</v>

3002
02:09:41.370 --> 02:09:42.203
<v Speaker 1>like who gives a shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she got into Harvard because of </v>

3003
02:09:45.641 --> 02:09:46.474
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which she claimed she was native </v>

3004
02:09:47.321 --> 02:09:51.530
<v Speaker 1>American when she got in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was claiming that she was a minor.</v>

3005
02:09:51.610 --> 02:09:52.443
<v Speaker 1>Was Hartford,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3006
02:09:52.480 --> 02:09:54.280
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm being honest with that.</v>

3007
02:09:55.120 --> 02:09:57.280
<v Speaker 1>Was it Cambridge?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever.</v>

3008
02:09:57.281 --> 02:09:58.114
<v Speaker 1>The university.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shenandoah university by claiming that </v>

3009
02:10:01.211 --> 02:10:03.790
<v Speaker 1>she was native American,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so she got a special scholarship because</v>

3010
02:10:03.791 --> 02:10:07.810
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Literally like me going to Morehouse and</v>

3011
02:10:07.811 --> 02:10:08.920
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm African American,</v>

3012
02:10:08.921 --> 02:10:13.921
<v Speaker 1>except I have a far better claim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a much higher percentage.</v>

3013
02:10:14.020 --> 02:10:14.853
<v Speaker 1>Much higher.</v>

3014
02:10:16.780 --> 02:10:18.460
<v Speaker 1>That's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wild.</v>

3015
02:10:18.461 --> 02:10:19.294
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's so nuts like because trump was </v>

3016
02:10:21.131 --> 02:10:23.930
<v Speaker 1>always calling her pocahontas and trump </v>
<v Speaker 1>said that if,</v>

3017
02:10:25.310 --> 02:10:26.800
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is it that you can't.</v>

3018
02:10:26.801 --> 02:10:28.960
<v Speaker 1>If you said the wrong thing on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast,</v>

3019
02:10:29.190 --> 02:10:30.023
<v Speaker 1>people will be up in arms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's unreasonably president can say </v>

3020
02:10:31.691 --> 02:10:32.524
<v Speaker 1>whatever the hell he wants to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's making tending to be a native </v>

3021
02:10:35.961 --> 02:10:38.020
<v Speaker 1>American.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was joking about heart.</v>

3022
02:10:38.021 --> 02:10:41.000
<v Speaker 1>She's not really native American,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he called her pocahontas and he said</v>

3023
02:10:41.001 --> 02:10:43.850
<v Speaker 1>if she took a DNA test and showed that </v>
<v Speaker 1>she was native American,</v>

3024
02:10:43.970 --> 02:10:46.670
<v Speaker 1>he would donate a million dollars to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>charity of your choice.</v>

3025
02:10:46.880 --> 02:10:47.713
<v Speaker 1>So she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after this fucking test that basically </v>

3026
02:10:50.661 --> 02:10:55.340
<v Speaker 1>showed she has these smallest measurable</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility.</v>

3027
02:10:55.550 --> 02:10:59.780
<v Speaker 1>Native American in her was requiring him</v>
<v Speaker 1>to pay.</v>

3028
02:11:01.570 --> 02:11:06.570
<v Speaker 1>You should pay Harvard for the money </v>
<v Speaker 1>back built from them were at school.</v>

3029
02:11:08.121 --> 02:11:11.990
<v Speaker 1>Did she go to trying to find the actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing it seems.</v>

3030
02:11:11.991 --> 02:11:14.090
<v Speaker 1>I think she actually got a job at </v>
<v Speaker 1>Harvard.</v>

3031
02:11:14.310 --> 02:11:15.143
<v Speaker 1>Not.</v>

3032
02:11:16.970 --> 02:11:19.630
<v Speaker 1>Didn't go there for education.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3033
02:11:19.700 --> 02:11:22.620
<v Speaker 1>she got a job there because of trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>find out.</v>

3034
02:11:22.760 --> 02:11:23.870
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll figure it out.</v>

3035
02:11:24.110 --> 02:11:26.000
<v Speaker 1>But that's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The I.</v>

3036
02:11:26.150 --> 02:11:31.150
<v Speaker 1>The idea that that is something you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>lean on is so goddamn crazy.</v>

3037
02:11:31.790 --> 02:11:33.740
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a white lady.</v>

3038
02:11:34.070 --> 02:11:36.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm a white guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shut the fuck up.</v>

3039
02:11:36.830 --> 02:11:37.663
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not.</v>

3040
02:11:37.790 --> 02:11:38.623
<v Speaker 1>There's no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not a part of you that has been </v>

3041
02:11:40.761 --> 02:11:43.970
<v Speaker 1>discriminated against because of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that you're native American.</v>

3042
02:11:43.971 --> 02:11:45.920
<v Speaker 1>It just doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not true.</v>

3043
02:11:46.400 --> 02:11:49.580
<v Speaker 1>That's just so fascinating to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People love to be a victim.</v>

3044
02:11:49.610 --> 02:11:50.860
<v Speaker 1>They love to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3045
02:11:51.020 --> 02:11:53.320
<v Speaker 1>it was my growing up was hard because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm one,</v>

3046
02:11:53.321 --> 02:11:56.570
<v Speaker 1>150,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>native American.</v>

3047
02:11:56.571 --> 02:11:58.010
<v Speaker 1>Crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>

3048
02:11:58.420 --> 02:11:59.810
<v Speaker 1>And where does it stop?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like is it,</v>

3049
02:11:59.870 --> 02:12:01.330
<v Speaker 1>is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it like,</v>

3050
02:12:02.090 --> 02:12:05.270
<v Speaker 1>is it cool to say that if you're two </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent or 10 percent or 50 percent,</v>

3051
02:12:05.271 --> 02:12:06.230
<v Speaker 1>like where's it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where's it?</v>

3052
02:12:06.350 --> 02:12:08.420
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At one point six percent,</v>

3053
02:12:08.421 --> 02:12:10.660
<v Speaker 1>I really don't feel like I could drop </v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3054
02:12:11.420 --> 02:12:13.370
<v Speaker 1>10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not 10 percent.</v>

3055
02:12:13.610 --> 02:12:14.443
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm mostly Italian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like three quarters of Italian so I </v>

3056
02:12:17.061 --> 02:12:19.670
<v Speaker 1>can call someone a Guinea Guinea no </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>

3057
02:12:19.910 --> 02:12:23.240
<v Speaker 1>but two times don't give a fuck if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>call them guineas like okay,</v>

3058
02:12:23.900 --> 02:12:28.900
<v Speaker 1>like there's no really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no good slurs for Italians work,</v>

3059
02:12:29.840 --> 02:12:30.673
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have successfully integrated into </v>

3060
02:12:32.751 --> 02:12:33.584
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when my grandfather used to tell me </v>

3061
02:12:35.271 --> 02:12:37.190
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he came over here when he was a boy from</v>

3062
02:12:37.191 --> 02:12:38.024
<v Speaker 1>Italy and he would tell me about how bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was about how much they were </v>

3063
02:12:41.691 --> 02:12:43.770
<v Speaker 1>discriminated against.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

3064
02:12:43.950 --> 02:12:44.783
<v Speaker 1>it was hard core.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they were treated a lot of the </v>

3065
02:12:47.121 --> 02:12:49.220
<v Speaker 1>same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Racist People Treat Mexicans today.</v>

3066
02:12:49.400 --> 02:12:50.510
<v Speaker 1>An Irish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>

3067
02:12:50.540 --> 02:12:51.330
<v Speaker 1>Same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3068
02:12:51.330 --> 02:12:52.163
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's my background is Italian and </v>

3069
02:12:53.871 --> 02:12:54.710
<v Speaker 1>Irish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mostly.</v>

3070
02:12:55.090 --> 02:12:58.340
<v Speaker 1>Someone got fucked by a black person </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere,</v>

3071
02:12:58.700 --> 02:12:59.250
<v Speaker 1>somewhere.</v>

3072
02:12:59.250 --> 02:13:01.880
<v Speaker 1>One point six percent know how many </v>
<v Speaker 1>generations.</v>

3073
02:13:02.510 --> 02:13:03.343
<v Speaker 1>I guess the claim is that she used her </v>
<v Speaker 1>claim that she's native American to get </v>

3074
02:13:06.741 --> 02:13:07.760
<v Speaker 1>a job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3075
02:13:07.810 --> 02:13:09.650
<v Speaker 1>Not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not to get into school,</v>

3076
02:13:10.010 --> 02:13:12.470
<v Speaker 1>get a job at Harvard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at one at Harvard,</v>

3077
02:13:12.471 --> 02:13:14.690
<v Speaker 1>one at Pennsylvania.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she did it twice.</v>

3078
02:13:16.160 --> 02:13:18.680
<v Speaker 1>Give that money back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I love the DNA test though.</v>

3079
02:13:18.890 --> 02:13:22.820
<v Speaker 1>I love the DNA test just proves it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're all like something.</v>

3080
02:13:22.970 --> 02:13:24.110
<v Speaker 1>We're all a bunch of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3081
02:13:24.650 --> 02:13:28.010
