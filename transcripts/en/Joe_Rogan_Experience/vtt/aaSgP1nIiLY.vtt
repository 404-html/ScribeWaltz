1
00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:19.830
Hey look,
it's the kid.
Gosh,
come on it.
Sure,
sure.

2
00:00:19.831 --> 00:00:23.820
I got a shirt on that says the kid case.
You were wondering,

3
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:24.990
I got tight fitting skin.

4
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.260
It's like how the fighters in smaller font because he gets more letters.

5
00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:32.190
You guys base it on like what's,
what's an even trade?
Did you weigh the ink?

6
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.800
Because the fighter is nice and long but the kid,

7
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.740
well he designs all our t shirts.
I'm terrible with clothing.

8
00:00:40.741 --> 00:00:43.190
I'm not a big fashion.
These to,

9
00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.500
you might want to look into someone who actually makes tee-shirts cause that

10
00:00:46.501 --> 00:00:50.520
looks like a fucking junior high school kid did the paintbrush.

11
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.333
That was the idea.

12
00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.330
That looks like art class that you didn't give a fuck about passing.

13
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.690
It's karate kid font though.
That's what I'm talking about.

14
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.530
Is it supposed to be like,
like Kung Fu movie fallen?
Yeah,
sure.

15
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.680
Part of the creative department.

16
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.120
I love both of you guys but that is one of the least creative tee shirts I've

17
00:01:12.121 --> 00:01:16.740
ever seen and I love that end thing.
That finer to end the end.

18
00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.810
The little fucking weird thing that that stands for end.

19
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.970
You know,
what does that,
what is the thing called?
Is that an Anderson?

20
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.660
That's what I thought ampersand was an a ha like a pound.

21
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.400
Like with the AE that's circled.
What does that at,

22
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.460
what does that,
what does the actual asterik no,
asterisk is the star,
right?

23
00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.220
Trying to make tee shirts for my,
well,
which one's ampersand?
I don't know.

24
00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.680
Let's find out.
Ampersand,
um,

25
00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.420
ampersand and yeah.
Okay.
Jamie's totally correct.

26
00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.490
So ampersand is the,

27
00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.790
that's the end like fighter and it's a weird little symbol.

28
00:02:02.041 --> 00:02:05.700
It's just slips on yours.
Yes,
you do obviously right there,
man.

29
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:10.710
Fighter in the kid.
And then that thing over the tea thing.
You just look at it.

30
00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.770
You need glasses bro.
I do not just because you need glasses.

31
00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.450
Glasses bandwagon.
They could,
you could read shit better.

32
00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.920
It's actually called a strudel in Israel.
Okay.
But we're not in Israel.

33
00:02:22.921 --> 00:02:25.360
What was it called in America?
Just the last,
that sign.

34
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.770
That side strudel.
Yeah.

35
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.510
That's one of those ones that like didn't have any play for like hundreds of

36
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.260
years.
They're like,
what does this useless fucking thing bring things back?

37
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.360
You would look like before Twitter and Facebook and all that shit and like in

38
00:02:42.361 --> 00:02:46.470
the name mid,
nothing.
You fucking never used that thing on the keyboard,

39
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.191
on a typewriter.

40
00:02:47.191 --> 00:02:51.450
That was a useless Goddamn k like who the hell needs that and thing you would

41
00:02:51.451 --> 00:02:53.880
ask like,
what is that?
It's some shit you'll never use.
Meanwhile,

42
00:02:53.881 --> 00:02:57.290
some shit everybody uses now.
Everybody's fucking Twitter handle it.
I'm not.

43
00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.010
How many
are you a pound sign or a hashtag person?
Well,

44
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:03.810
you really should say pound side,
right?
I mean,

45
00:03:03.811 --> 00:03:06.820
why is it good to be Hashtag it's the same goddamn thing.

46
00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.680
It has a different connotation.

47
00:03:08.681 --> 00:03:12.640
What was a pound signs connotation that it was just on your phone.

48
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.390
Remember Star.
It's like it would be,
you would punctuate the,
send them,
send a,

49
00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.160
you know,
a message or so like a voicemail.
Press the pound sign.
That's all,

50
00:03:21.161 --> 00:03:25.470
but they say the LB side,
but then all of a sudden Hashtag came along.
What?

51
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.650
He's making corn beef.
He's slinging,
slinging hash.
What kind of Hash is this?

52
00:03:29.651 --> 00:03:34.060
Twitter has this,
we'd Hash,
how'd you call it?
Hashtag hashtag question mark.

53
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.220
What's the origin?
Someone's going to send us a link on Twitter.

54
00:03:36.221 --> 00:03:41.200
I'm sure the origins of the word Hashtag Hashtag came from Twitter,

55
00:03:41.201 --> 00:03:44.940
right?
Yeah.
Yeah,
and then Facebook adopted.
As I was talking to this,

56
00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.720
I was talking to as linguist,
I was saying,
why didn't,

57
00:03:46.721 --> 00:03:49.750
why didn't like southern accents for example in Mississippi,
never go away.

58
00:03:49.751 --> 00:03:54.751
Why did like certain regions hat hold onto their accents and he said most of it

59
00:03:55.241 --> 00:03:58.510
has to do with the fact that you copy the person who's older.

60
00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.090
The person you look up to,
if he has an accent,

61
00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.010
that's the guy you're going to try to talk like.

62
00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.410
So it gets passed down from generation to generation.

63
00:04:05.411 --> 00:04:08.470
It doesn't really get diluted because they just stand up.
More.

64
00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:11.230
Human beings are tribal and so what they do with you,

65
00:04:11.231 --> 00:04:13.960
if you grew up around your dad or your older brother or somebody who look up to

66
00:04:13.961 --> 00:04:16.450
who speaks a certain way without even realizing it,

67
00:04:16.451 --> 00:04:20.120
you start taking on their language.
You speak exactly the way I do,

68
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.820
same intonation and everything,

69
00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.950
and so what happens is that accent in Louisiana will always stay that accent in

70
00:04:26.951 --> 00:04:29.440
Louisiana.
It's really interesting,
but then that can,

71
00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.730
that can start to sort of change as much as people migrate a bunch of bad

72
00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.310
motherfuckers,
bunch of Badass big Dick.

73
00:04:36.311 --> 00:04:40.330
South Africans came in and just fucked everybody in the town dominated,

74
00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.700
came in with billions dollars of cash.
Who'd be interesting,

75
00:04:42.701 --> 00:04:46.180
if there was a way where you could restructure an accent,

76
00:04:46.181 --> 00:04:51.181
just a few dominant Alpha chimpanzee males with a strange accent,

77
00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.750
you know,
strange South African accent.
Like if there was a way,

78
00:04:55.751 --> 00:04:58.360
like some bad motherfuckers could move into an area,

79
00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:00.310
well if everybody would want to be like them so much,

80
00:05:00.311 --> 00:05:03.530
they would start talking like South Africa,
if you go to Barcelona in Spain,
they,

81
00:05:03.531 --> 00:05:03.961
they,
they,

82
00:05:03.961 --> 00:05:08.961
they talk with [inaudible] and they say that is because the king had a list a

83
00:05:11.241 --> 00:05:15.180
long time ago and everybody started to copy that sort of,
you know,
that,

84
00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.160
that colloquialism or whatever.
Well,

85
00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:22.170
it is kind of weird that Lyft is considered to be od the one strange sound that

86
00:05:22.511 --> 00:05:24.220
you make,
but roving,

87
00:05:24.221 --> 00:05:28.420
the autos is considered to be flamboyant and beautiful.

88
00:05:28.421 --> 00:05:31.360
Like if you say someone who speak the Queen's English,
of course I didn't know,

89
00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:34.240
but we have like that we have like categories we'll,

90
00:05:34.241 --> 00:05:38.170
we'll put like this is a sound that you should make and this is a sound where

91
00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:41.950
it's fucked up.
It's,
I don't like it.
And it's all based on our control.

92
00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.960
See the list of the issue with the list.
Busy.

93
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.840
Some people cannot control the fact that they make that sound,

94
00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:51.050
so they're not trying to lift.
You have very difficult for them to not live yet.

95
00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.630
But so because of that,
that sound becomes inappropriate.
Yeah.

96
00:05:55.631 --> 00:05:57.980
Maybe it's because when

97
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.520
<v 1>you have a list,
it's already quote unquote a defect.</v>

98
00:06:01.521 --> 00:06:05.660
So it's considered a weakness.
So that would be something that is,
well,

99
00:06:05.661 --> 00:06:08.180
it's just because he can't control it.
That's why it's a weakness.

100
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:12.980
If he rolls his ours on purpose,
then it sounds cool.
He's undoing of,
but not us.

101
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:13.941
But if he wrote,

102
00:06:13.941 --> 00:06:16.970
you roll your eyes because you can't stop like you're at the scanner McGregor,

103
00:06:16.971 --> 00:06:19.000
but keep calling them [inaudible] Connor,

104
00:06:19.001 --> 00:06:23.750
I can go into a little bit of his home with us and that's a different thing.

105
00:06:23.751 --> 00:06:27.930
An Irish thing.
But yeah,
the RS are slippery,
right?
Yeah.

106
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:32.570
Do you know what I'm saying?
Yes.
What if that was a disease,

107
00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:37.370
you know,
instead of a lisp.
Right.
You know,
it was always got a Ross Perot.
Oh,

108
00:06:37.371 --> 00:06:40.890
the poor bastard content of the speech impediment.
Gutters.

109
00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:45.200
Gutters or neurological starters,
Huh?
Yeah.
That's a neurological thing.

110
00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:48.770
There was a kid that,
uh,
I used to be friends with and his brother have stutter,

111
00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:53.480
poor,
poor bastard.
It just fucking just would lock up,
man.

112
00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:57.560
He would lock up in front of you and you'd want to like help him through it and

113
00:06:57.561 --> 00:07:00.890
you have to act like nothing.
My,
that something about status in deer.

114
00:07:00.891 --> 00:07:03.110
Me To the person,
like I want to protect them.

115
00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:05.780
We had a guy in my taekwondo school who would,

116
00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:07.710
sometimes we'd line up and he'd have to say Chartio,

117
00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:11.660
Kanye to like now and he could hit such a bad stutter.

118
00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:13.370
So we obviously there and you go check up

119
00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:20.150
and we have to wait sometimes for 40 seconds.
Wow.
But of course we all did.

120
00:07:20.151 --> 00:07:23.210
And something about a stutter has always made me feel protective over the purse.

121
00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.940
If you're stuttering all the time,
she,
you be getting kicked in the head.

122
00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:30.830
That's seems like a good question.
You got a,
you got shit going on there already.

123
00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:32.120
Some bad connections.

124
00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:35.810
Maybe you could rattle it loose like you hear about those stories were like kid

125
00:07:35.811 --> 00:07:38.720
gets in a car accident and all of sudden they could play music.
Yeah.

126
00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:41.750
Well there's a Robert Sacks to the thing about this guy who got struck by

127
00:07:41.751 --> 00:07:46.751
lightening is regular dude got struck by lightning and became obsessed with

128
00:07:48.141 --> 00:07:48.561
music,

129
00:07:48.561 --> 00:07:52.670
especially the piano and just didn't literally did nothing but play 12 hours a

130
00:07:52.671 --> 00:07:56.880
day and think piano and,
and,
and he was convinced it was a sign from God.

131
00:07:56.881 --> 00:07:59.270
And so Robert Sacks said,
well,
you know,

132
00:07:59.271 --> 00:08:02.510
it may be a sign from God but is there any way I can study your brain?

133
00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:07.310
And he said,
no,
no I,
this is Scott and I'm not interested in the scientific.

134
00:08:07.311 --> 00:08:10.670
And he was just such a bummer for him.
Cause like what the fuck happened?

135
00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:14.600
What happened that you got struck by lightning and you became obsessed with the

136
00:08:14.601 --> 00:08:16.880
piano where he literally played all day.

137
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000
I think he's probably scared that if you find something that's wrong that they

138
00:08:22.191 --> 00:08:25.700
might like fix it.
Well I took it back to being normal.

139
00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:30.730
Well it's very strange to me also because what they find with people who like

140
00:08:30.951 --> 00:08:33.710
when they say something like,
oh you've got to follow your passion man.

141
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.350
Problem with that is that you've got to broaden your passion.

142
00:08:36.351 --> 00:08:38.390
Cause sometimes you're passionate would be just what you know.

143
00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:42.950
And a lot of people consider their passion of what they're just good at already

144
00:08:42.951 --> 00:08:46.520
or they,
they came at it with us,
the right,
you know,
emotional state.

145
00:08:46.521 --> 00:08:47.900
So it was easier for them to learn.

146
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:52.330
But some passions you have to work at really hard before you get good at them,

147
00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:56.040
like math or for that matter even like boxing,
you know,
or something

148
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.420
<v 2>like that,
but so,
right.</v>

149
00:08:57.421 --> 00:09:02.040
But why would you think that he would want to not have his brain examined?
Oh,

150
00:09:02.041 --> 00:09:04.140
I think that was absolutely just superstitious thing.

151
00:09:04.141 --> 00:09:05.790
I think that he kind of felt he,

152
00:09:05.791 --> 00:09:08.870
it would go away if somebody did something to his brain.
I do.

153
00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:12.390
I was with Sachs said,
I mean in effect,

154
00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:17.160
I would wonder if he would be afraid that it was purely psychological.

155
00:09:17.161 --> 00:09:18.420
Like this is my,

156
00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:22.770
I think there's a lot of people who say they believe in God and they'll talk

157
00:09:22.771 --> 00:09:24.300
about the fact they believe in God,

158
00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:29.810
but I don't know if they believe 100% I think it might believe like 80% 20%

159
00:09:30.241 --> 00:09:31.630
haunts them.
Don't,

160
00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:35.940
they don't want to address that 20% and when something like this happens,

161
00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:39.540
whereas a tangible effect of a physical act and you attribute it to God.

162
00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:44.520
If someone comes along and says,
no,
you're Abdula Mangala,
whatever,
the gut fried,

163
00:09:44.521 --> 00:09:45.960
you don't have that part of your brain anymore.

164
00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:48.630
And that part of your brain dictate social skills.

165
00:09:48.631 --> 00:09:51.870
Like if you have a hard time like talking to people.
Yeah,
well you lost that.

166
00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:55.350
That part's not there anymore.
So you're basing,
you know,
all of you,

167
00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:58.230
all your attention is now going to music.

168
00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:01.620
And if you found out that instead of like God gave you a gift,

169
00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:03.630
that would fuck with your head.
That's right.

170
00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:07.320
Well a lot of they say that people who,
the fundamentalists,
people who are,

171
00:10:07.321 --> 00:10:09.480
you know,
they believe and they're willing to die for their beliefs.

172
00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:12.960
There's always a great deal of doubt,
way more dealt with those people.

173
00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:16.170
How much fucking mental illnesses there in this world.
You know,

174
00:10:16.171 --> 00:10:17.850
it's something no one wants to bring up.

175
00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:23.150
No one wants to bring up like how much of believing in unbelievably ludicrous

176
00:10:24.031 --> 00:10:28.080
shit is a type of a mental illness.
The first question though also is this,

177
00:10:28.081 --> 00:10:29.700
I mean if you say,
I believe in God,

178
00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:33.030
I actually think a better question initially is what is God?
First of all,

179
00:10:33.031 --> 00:10:35.460
how do you define God?
Yeah,
I mean as God,

180
00:10:35.461 --> 00:10:40.080
what they thought he was when they were riding on animal skins or can we define

181
00:10:40.081 --> 00:10:44.310
God as there's,
there's obviously a better look,
there's,

182
00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:47.520
there's a way that feels good in this world and there's a way that feels bad in

183
00:10:47.521 --> 00:10:52.230
this world.
What feels bad?
Tragedy,
disease,

184
00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:57.040
injury,
pain,
suffering,
violence,
crimes,

185
00:10:57.150 --> 00:11:01.470
stealing,
taking advantage of robbing that.
Oh,
did you hear what that fuck did?

186
00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:05.610
Oh this guy got fucked over.
Oh this guy got beat up.
Look at this video.

187
00:11:05.611 --> 00:11:09.960
Fuck this guy got this.
That's obviously the worst way to go.

188
00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:11.460
I mean we feel that right?

189
00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:17.360
But positive is like you see friendship and you see happy kids playing and you

190
00:11:18.841 --> 00:11:22.760
see people smiling cause they enjoy the self sacrifice.

191
00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:25.410
Barbecues you see,

192
00:11:25.411 --> 00:11:28.650
you see like prosperity and friendship and kinship.

193
00:11:28.651 --> 00:11:32.400
You see all this good stuff.
And so if you just,

194
00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:37.520
obviously if you just live your life more towards the good stuff is the most you

195
00:11:38.161 --> 00:11:40.370
can.
That's like a godly life.
Yeah.

196
00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:44.400
It's like if that's the rational life,
right?
That's what they called it.

197
00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:47.170
Does that what they called it?
The rational,
like in other words,
you,

198
00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:52.080
as long as you stay within what would be considered the rational.
So,
so if you,

199
00:11:52.081 --> 00:11:53.980
um,
but it's right there was

200
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:55.780
<v 0>wrote,
Roman law was kind of predicated on,
right?</v>

201
00:11:55.781 --> 00:12:00.130
So if you park your chariot in an area where they do in Carthage and you get a

202
00:12:00.131 --> 00:12:03.150
ticket and you go to the judge and you say,
Hey Roman judge and Carthage,

203
00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:05.200
we park our terrorists this way in the room.
And judge goes,
okay,

204
00:12:05.201 --> 00:12:08.410
well in Rome we do it this way.
So try to do,
try to do it that way,

205
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:12.250
but did this way delineate,
delineate the law.
Then a man comes along,

206
00:12:12.251 --> 00:12:16.060
snatches the baby out of woman's arm and kidnaps at our kills it or something.

207
00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:19.450
And all of us go and he'd go,
well,
I know we do that in Carthage.
Well,

208
00:12:19.451 --> 00:12:22.420
what the room would Roman law would say is we don't,
well,

209
00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:24.100
whether you do that in Carthage or not,

210
00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:27.430
doesn't matter because this is outside the bounds of rationality.

211
00:12:27.431 --> 00:12:31.900
This is outside the bounds of nature.
This is an unnatural act.

212
00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:34.750
And so Romans,
they were Cicero.

213
00:12:34.751 --> 00:12:38.060
CICERO was a father drawer in fighting people and fucking each other in the

214
00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:39.370
cause because they also had,

215
00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:43.540
they also had a massive empire that had to be run according to set up a set of

216
00:12:43.541 --> 00:12:46.330
principles,
you have to have something that doesn't make sense.

217
00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:51.750
Everybody's idea of what that is depends on tiredly upon what happened to them

218
00:12:51.911 --> 00:12:55.330
when they were young.
It's what you're exposed to when you're really young.

219
00:12:55.630 --> 00:13:00.280
If you find out about the vast majority of people that commit horrific acts,

220
00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:05.610
like a good chunk of them had some serious trauma when they were young.

221
00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:09.490
Whether it was someone sexually molested them or someone abused them.

222
00:13:09.491 --> 00:13:12.430
There was a lot of abuse.
There's something wrong.
The only,

223
00:13:12.431 --> 00:13:14.770
there's a few of them that people can't figure out.
Like you know,

224
00:13:14.771 --> 00:13:16.570
it was a big one that they have a hard time to figure out.

225
00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:21.930
Jeffrey Dahmer Dahmer apparently had like normal parents that that's sociopath

226
00:13:22.151 --> 00:13:26.050
gene that there's been so much research recently written on this.
In fact,

227
00:13:26.051 --> 00:13:28.790
a Barbara Oakley wrote a book called the evil jeans and,

228
00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:33.830
and they really looked at at how different serial killer brains and they think

229
00:13:34.511 --> 00:13:39.511
that there is for sure something that goes on genetically with sociopathic.

230
00:13:40.181 --> 00:13:43.450
John Wayne Gacy and those kinds of people.
They actually,
in many cases,

231
00:13:43.451 --> 00:13:47.260
you can actually tell they have a different brain than do regular people.

232
00:13:47.261 --> 00:13:51.010
And there's a lot of science now about that can be extreme sense.

233
00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:54.190
If you look at every body type there is,

234
00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:59.080
look at all the different flaws that people just are born with.
Like,
like me,

235
00:13:59.081 --> 00:14:00.280
like I've,
I've been a Lego,

236
00:14:00.281 --> 00:14:02.890
so have spots where I don't grow any pigment around my knuckles.

237
00:14:02.891 --> 00:14:07.570
Bigger Hanson Brennan shop,
keep calling it.
But yeah,
it's very giant has evolved.

238
00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:10.450
I've got a lot of issues,
but that's probably not,

239
00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:15.770
that's probably not bad.
It's just the guy gave me freaky bones.
Right.

240
00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:18.820
But the bad stuff is very minimal.

241
00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:22.660
You look at some bad stuff that people have,
like we know people that are dead.

242
00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:25.030
We know people that had cancer and died.

243
00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:30.180
We know people that are born with like degenerative arthritis.

244
00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:34.060
You know,
um,
Sean rouse,
I mean that poor bastard.
I mean,

245
00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:38.830
that poor bastard is always in pain and he's a fucking funny dude,
man.

246
00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:43.840
Rouse is funniest shit.
He's really good.
And He,
kids always in pain.

247
00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:46.600
Every time you shake his hands,
she's like,
you know,

248
00:14:46.601 --> 00:14:50.370
you just want to be as gentle as you can and just,
you know,
rheumatoid.
Oh,

249
00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:54.760
it's bad dude.
It's bad.
It's an auto.
And we just got new knees though.
Yeah,

250
00:14:54.761 --> 00:14:59.630
you got to get his knees posting,
man.
Fuck,
he's in his thirties.
Yeah,
Dude.
He's,

251
00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:04.100
you know,
he just,
the genetic roll the dice.
It just said he got fucked.

252
00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:08.000
And so my point was there's so much variation in like,

253
00:15:08.001 --> 00:15:12.530
you see people with dwarfism,
you seen people with gigantism,

254
00:15:12.531 --> 00:15:14.240
there's variation everywhere.

255
00:15:14.241 --> 00:15:18.290
It just would only make sense that there'd be variation in the structure of the

256
00:15:18.291 --> 00:15:22.440
actual brain itself.
Some people are born with weak eyesight there.

257
00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:27.110
Their eyesight's sucks.
Right out of the gain is a physic,
physical body.

258
00:15:27.111 --> 00:15:30.020
I mean it's,
it says,
no reason to believe that that,
you know,
first of all,

259
00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:34.400
first of all,
evolutionary biologists have come to the conclusion that the brain,

260
00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:37.190
our brains are different.
I mean,
you're not born a blank slate.

261
00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:39.800
Here's the big question.
Here's the really big question.

262
00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:41.570
This is the one for everybody.
This is a hard one.

263
00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:47.170
As medical science reaches a certain point where they understand the components

264
00:15:47.181 --> 00:15:51.430
of the brain far more clearly than they do now.
Cause like,
you know,

265
00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:54.800
one of the themes that we've had on the show the last few days,

266
00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:59.690
I had the scar fattiness Russell on and um,
he was,

267
00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:03.320
he was talking about how just like a hundred years or so ago,

268
00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:08.180
the way people would look at certain races was radically different than the way

269
00:16:08.181 --> 00:16:10.400
they look at them now.
Like in medical journals and shit.

270
00:16:10.401 --> 00:16:13.670
The way they would describe Irish was that they were like basically like apes

271
00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:16.910
and they would do this in like Harvard.
It was really fascinating conversation.

272
00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:19.850
We know now that's ridiculous,
right?

273
00:16:19.851 --> 00:16:23.690
We know now that there's brilliant people from every single race and it's the

274
00:16:23.691 --> 00:16:26.090
big part of it is what do you expose to,
you know,

275
00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:28.580
what kind of genetics are you dealing with and you know,

276
00:16:28.581 --> 00:16:30.470
what kind of curiosity do you have in your family?

277
00:16:30.471 --> 00:16:35.270
What w w how do you develop what makes us so you're nurtured versus your nature?

278
00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:36.680
Yeah.
What makes a sprinter,

279
00:16:36.681 --> 00:16:40.100
does that disqualify him from being a brilliant thinker?
No,
it doesn't,
you know,

280
00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:42.890
those ideas are,
those ideas were in the past.

281
00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:47.630
But if there was a way where they could examine your brain and go,

282
00:16:47.631 --> 00:16:52.040
well this guy has no empathy,
this guy completely lacks at the end.

283
00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:55.430
He gets an enjoyment out of torturing animals.

284
00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:58.070
If you could find Sarah doing that.
And in fact,

285
00:16:58.071 --> 00:17:01.720
what they found is a lot of serial killers have underdeveloped,
uh,

286
00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:05.360
McCullough's so that almond shaped that part of the brand and believes that that

287
00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:07.460
floods with Serotonin,
et cetera.

288
00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:12.680
And a lot of them have smaller than normal or they're damaged and it's,

289
00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:14.000
it's hard for like,

290
00:17:14.001 --> 00:17:18.110
one of the things that they talk about serial killers a lot of times is for them

291
00:17:18.111 --> 00:17:22.790
to feel is sometimes close to impossible.
They've got,

292
00:17:22.791 --> 00:17:26.390
it goes into extremes,
but sexual sadism and all that stuff,

293
00:17:26.391 --> 00:17:28.320
is that what they call,
um,

294
00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:32.170
what this guy had the great famous profile or Richard Walter Calls,
uh,

295
00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:36.860
a power excitement.
So people who get off on the,
some people will kill you,

296
00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:39.140
overpower they want to kill you.
But,

297
00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.390
but when somebody has been torturing somebody,

298
00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:46.220
they get off on the act of killing,
not the killing,
the act of killing.

299
00:17:46.221 --> 00:17:48.530
And that's,
those kinds of people have,

300
00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:52.950
they think have different brains that just get off on the power and they're not

301
00:17:52.951 --> 00:17:53.910
feeling any remorse.

302
00:17:53.911 --> 00:17:58.200
They get sexual pleasure from putting people in terrible pain.
Do you,

303
00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:02.130
here's the question.
If they can spot that,

304
00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:05.670
I mean how weird is the world get?
Why are you going to let that guy live?

305
00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:10.230
Like we would all have to look at them like it's no different,
in my opinion,

306
00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:12.390
than having a vampire that lives in your neighborhood.

307
00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:15.360
If you had a vampire in your neighborhood and the vampire was constantly

308
00:18:15.361 --> 00:18:18.030
compelled to feed on human blood,

309
00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:21.840
how long would it take before everybody rallied the troops and stuck a fucking

310
00:18:21.841 --> 00:18:24.270
stake in that vampires heart?
It would take.
That's a very,

311
00:18:24.271 --> 00:18:26.340
that's a very good question.
The first day.

312
00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:31.460
Now if you found a way to absolutely identify a serial killer,

313
00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:36.060
like this guy is a fucking serial killer.
This guy's this die.

314
00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:39.360
This is what's important to him.
This is what he doesn't give a fuck about.

315
00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:43.320
This guy loves killing.
He loves torturing.
Get doesn't give a fuck.
Yeah,

316
00:18:43.321 --> 00:18:45.600
you'd have to kill him.
It would be like having a vampire,
right?
I mean,

317
00:18:45.601 --> 00:18:49.650
wouldn't it be this or it'd be another thing.
How about this?
By the same token,

318
00:18:49.651 --> 00:18:50.010
what you,

319
00:18:50.010 --> 00:18:52.770
what would you would have to say about somebody like that is they have brain

320
00:18:52.771 --> 00:18:55.170
damage.
Their brains are damaged.

321
00:18:55.171 --> 00:18:59.070
They are not working like an irrational human beings.
So you want to fix it?
No.

322
00:18:59.071 --> 00:18:59.281
Well,

323
00:18:59.281 --> 00:19:04.281
either you fix it or you categorically look at it the same way you would look at

324
00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:09.900
any kind of a d,
a birth defect or a handicap.

325
00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:13.560
What that means then is what does that say about punitive punishment?

326
00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:17.700
Do you punish them or do you put them in a hospital and keep them in a padded

327
00:19:17.701 --> 00:19:21.240
room?
That's the other question.
Well,
what kind of a life is that?
I don't know,

328
00:19:21.241 --> 00:19:23.070
but,
but,
but whatever you do,

329
00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:25.740
let's just say that we can prove their brains are different.

330
00:19:25.741 --> 00:19:27.960
This is a physiological thing they had no control over.

331
00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:31.320
But at the end of the day,
they have urges.
They have no control over.
Say the way.

332
00:19:31.321 --> 00:19:35.340
Somebody who gambles really badly now what now?
Now,
yes,
they're killers.

333
00:19:35.341 --> 00:19:39.780
They're horrible.
We want him dead.
Frankly,
it's a sick dog well to human being.

334
00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:43.350
So what do we do then?
What does that say about punitive punishment?

335
00:19:43.351 --> 00:19:46.950
Do you punish them or do you put them in a hospital,
uh,

336
00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:51.260
and put them in the room with a very sensible John Wayne like character who's

337
00:19:51.261 --> 00:19:55.140
going to say,
why don't you guys step outside and you hear a bang?

338
00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:59.700
He went for my gun and then go home.
That's what happened.
I would agree.

339
00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:01.680
I think it's spirit can't write a law like that though.

340
00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:05.730
Experiment on him is not a bad idea.
Using monkeys use humans cause you can't,

341
00:20:05.731 --> 00:20:08.130
you can't write a law like that because it's not consistent.

342
00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:11.940
It's inconsistent with how about this?
Every time you experiment on him,

343
00:20:11.941 --> 00:20:13.320
you let him kill an asshole.

344
00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:20.580
You take like a child molester and every time like the serial killer,

345
00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:23.730
you let it like you'll try some new birth control on them or something.

346
00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:28.050
Every time you let them kill a child molester.
Yeah.
Well Richard,
Richard Walter,

347
00:20:28.051 --> 00:20:32.190
that FBI profiler was the guy who kept quite,
came up with a double helix,

348
00:20:32.191 --> 00:20:34.350
whatever he called it of how a serial killer,

349
00:20:34.351 --> 00:20:36.570
he interviewed 20,000 murderers or something like that.

350
00:20:36.850 --> 00:20:41.850
And what's really fascinating to hear him talk about how serial killers come to

351
00:20:42.361 --> 00:20:46.950
be,
so how they start and they start in really weird ways.

352
00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:48.040
It starts with some

353
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:51.940
<v 1>kind of fetishism like,
like rubbing up somebody against somebody in a,
in a,</v>

354
00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:56.230
in a bus stop or they call it p carism.

355
00:20:56.231 --> 00:21:00.250
Sometimes I'll find like when a cop hears about somebody who cut up a bunch of

356
00:21:00.251 --> 00:21:04.990
leather jackets in a store,
Ooh,
they'll go,
hold on.

357
00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:07.030
We want to come in there and look at something.

358
00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:10.000
Because what Richard Walter would say,

359
00:21:10.010 --> 00:21:13.480
it says a lot of them who were into just cutting people,

360
00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:18.960
a lot of them started by going into department stores and doing terrible damage

361
00:21:19.451 --> 00:21:23.710
to all the fine leather by cutting with a very sharp scalpel.

362
00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:26.140
And they got off on the fact that first they could get caught.

363
00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:28.780
It's very expensive,
they'd be in big trouble.
But also they,

364
00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:33.160
it's the feeling of skin.
So,
so then what happens with serial killers,

365
00:21:33.161 --> 00:21:37.030
they said is that you keep going and you keep needing a bigger and bigger fix

366
00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:39.610
and you never go back from that.

367
00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:43.840
Like you never are able to reverse the perversion.

368
00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:46.780
So once they have,
once they upped the ante on up the ante on,

369
00:21:46.781 --> 00:21:51.460
so finally they kill,
you're never,
they're never going back.
Never that,

370
00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:53.860
that urge continues to come back more and more.
That's John,

371
00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:55.440
that's what Ted Bundy would talk about.
Well,

372
00:21:55.441 --> 00:21:59.230
one of the most terrifying ones was the Zodiac killer because he was obviously

373
00:21:59.231 --> 00:22:01.930
super smart who would write things in code.

374
00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:05.410
He would leave them messages to crack and an author write letters to the

375
00:22:05.411 --> 00:22:09.310
victim's parents of families and he never got caught,
never got caught.

376
00:22:09.311 --> 00:22:10.510
They don't know who that guy was.

377
00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:14.880
There's all these different fucking speculations.
None of them,
you know,

378
00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:19.570
seem to be 100% they have some idea like,
you know,
people said that was my dad.

379
00:22:19.571 --> 00:22:22.750
People said I know the guy,
but the,
whoever the guy was,

380
00:22:22.751 --> 00:22:26.350
he had to be above average intelligence.
Very,
very smart.

381
00:22:26.351 --> 00:22:29.200
Which is fucking terrifying.
That someone could be very,

382
00:22:29.201 --> 00:22:32.730
very smart and just wanting to say this,
just want to fucking kill people.
Yeah,

383
00:22:33.490 --> 00:22:37.440
and they're out there.
It's,
it's the sort of,
I look at it as like,
um,

384
00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:39.650
what does that book the Mom,

385
00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:44.470
do you ever read the Ma the demonic male about chimps?

386
00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:48.910
Uh,
actually apes and how human beings are bipolar rapes capable of incredible

387
00:22:48.911 --> 00:22:52.900
kindness and incredible cruelty.
And maybe,
and if you look at apes,

388
00:22:52.901 --> 00:22:53.381
they'll do that.

389
00:22:53.381 --> 00:22:57.540
Like chimps will fucking kill each other and bite each other than they're

390
00:22:57.550 --> 00:23:01.550
incredibly caring of the young sometimes.
And we're a bipolar rape,
you know?
Um,

391
00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:03.940
but,
but that,
that could have a genetic,
uh,

392
00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:08.080
usefulness apparently like the variation in genes,

393
00:23:08.081 --> 00:23:11.830
one extreme to the other,
one extreme being,
I don't know,
mother Theresa,

394
00:23:11.831 --> 00:23:13.300
the other extreme beam,
Jeffrey Dahmer,

395
00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:15.760
and we all kind of lived somewhere in the middle.

396
00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:19.810
But geneticists will tell you that you need both extremes,
you know,

397
00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:21.790
to create the mean.
It's pretty fucking,
you know,

398
00:23:21.791 --> 00:23:23.860
you start getting into this science and you're like,
God dammit,

399
00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:28.210
we start thinking about that.
If you,
if you think about needing both sides,

400
00:23:28.211 --> 00:23:31.710
like is that exist everywhere in the universe?
Is there a hot Nicole,
he's there.

401
00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:36.160
Yang,
is there always an evil and a group group?
The it doesn't,

402
00:23:36.161 --> 00:23:39.370
does the evil make the good better?
Does it make it feel better?

403
00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:41.290
I mean is that a part of the whole thing?

404
00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:44.050
I think it was enough to write and it was like we were talking about,
um,

405
00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:48.620
people who were born into or with Rory yesterday where Albany's hilarious guy.

406
00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:51.650
We're talking about people born into money and that when people were born into

407
00:23:51.651 --> 00:23:53.720
money that never happy.
They just can't,

408
00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:56.570
they can't do because everything's always been handed to them.
They,

409
00:23:56.571 --> 00:24:00.740
if they don't earn it,
if you don't feel that struggle of being broke,

410
00:24:00.741 --> 00:24:05.741
like I think you and I appreciate everything we we've earned because when you

411
00:24:06.981 --> 00:24:09.920
were young you can clearly remember that,
you know,

412
00:24:09.921 --> 00:24:14.600
you were fucking trying to pay your bills and doing odd jobs and there was

413
00:24:14.601 --> 00:24:17.110
always longing,
you know,
it's kind of jobs that you,
Judy,

414
00:24:17.111 --> 00:24:19.580
you worked in a bank for a while.
I worked in Mcdonald's,

415
00:24:19.581 --> 00:24:23.900
I worked construction for a summer in DC in the middle of the summer.

416
00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:27.710
Your story about working in a bank was so,
uh,
so on,

417
00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:30.380
cause that's 16 months to waking up when it was still dark,

418
00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:35.080
put it on nylon socks.
I literally,
I thought I was going to die.
I,

419
00:24:35.081 --> 00:24:39.680
I started to become,
I started to dislike myself.
I was,
I was being,

420
00:24:39.681 --> 00:24:42.440
I became,
I wasn't even an incident when I was eating anymore.

421
00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:47.410
I became a bad person.
But that's how you got out of it because you're your soul,

422
00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:50.540
whatever.
It was trying to not panic.
I said I have to be an actor.

423
00:24:50.541 --> 00:24:53.420
I ran into my friend's room.
I go,
okay dude,
I'm quitting everything.

424
00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:57.140
And that's what I have.
I had a dream,
you know,
I'll tell you an amazing study.

425
00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:02.270
I'll tell you an amazing study on,
on your point in nine in the 1930s,

426
00:25:02.271 --> 00:25:07.130
they did this five year study on Boston school children and they took,

427
00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:11.330
do you know the story?
No,
but I'll tell you right now,
80% of our twats no,

428
00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:16.550
those kids get off me.
You little fuck you might be right.

429
00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:20.750
Dixon twats but it's a really famous study that had far reaching implications,

430
00:25:20.751 --> 00:25:25.751
which was they took two large groups and for five years they gave one group a

431
00:25:25.881 --> 00:25:30.670
great deal of support,
uh,
money,
psych,
psychological help,
tutor,

432
00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:32.780
tutoring coaches,
and the other group,

433
00:25:32.781 --> 00:25:36.140
they left completely alone and it came back 30 years later and looked at both

434
00:25:36.141 --> 00:25:37.880
groups and the group that had it,

435
00:25:37.881 --> 00:25:42.800
five years of that kind of special attention fair was faring far worse and had

436
00:25:42.801 --> 00:25:47.360
much higher levels of alcohol abuse than the other because the other group had

437
00:25:47.361 --> 00:25:52.361
to rely on the s become self reliant and that required all the other things now,

438
00:25:52.401 --> 00:25:54.650
yet you have to be careful because sometimes you can damage somebody,

439
00:25:54.651 --> 00:25:57.180
but certainly self-reliance and,

440
00:25:57.270 --> 00:26:01.610
and not learning helplessness,
but learning the opposite.
So fucking important.

441
00:26:01.611 --> 00:26:04.760
Well,
it's,
it's there right in front of our eyes.
We just want to ignore it.

442
00:26:04.790 --> 00:26:05.621
Like what'd you just said?

443
00:26:05.621 --> 00:26:08.890
You have to be careful with the stress because you could damage somebody.
Well,

444
00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:11.750
that's like analogous to working out like,
yeah,

445
00:26:11.751 --> 00:26:12.980
you could hurt yourself working out,

446
00:26:12.981 --> 00:26:17.981
but if your idea is to just stay a piece of veal in a room that's padded so that

447
00:26:18.021 --> 00:26:23.021
your body doesn't ever move and get injured or get strong as shit so that you

448
00:26:23.421 --> 00:26:25.550
know,
you could do a lot of things with your body.
Yeah.

449
00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:29.650
Like what would you rather like?
Not Be in pain all the time and not like,

450
00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:33.320
I like feeling your body deteriorating.
Right.
You know,

451
00:26:33.321 --> 00:26:35.690
I don't mean sore from working out.
I mean like when you're,

452
00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:39.140
when you have nothing,
you have no muscle.

453
00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:43.980
Everything is just mush and Goo and slowly gravity pulling towards

454
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:47.270
<v 2>the bottom.
Well,
that's what happens if you don't ever risk exercising.</v>

455
00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:50.970
The same thing with your brain.
You build neural pathways in your brain.

456
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.620
You can literally build them.
Yeah.

457
00:26:52.621 --> 00:26:55.580
I would think that with everything in this world,
you,

458
00:26:56.050 --> 00:27:00.480
you can either resist and then grow stronger because of resisting or never

459
00:27:00.481 --> 00:27:05.481
resist and have this like apathetic way of approaching whatever the fuck it is

460
00:27:05.911 --> 00:27:09.360
you're doing.
Like everything you do,
everything you do is hard to do.

461
00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:12.750
Everybody's like,
Oh,
you know,
it's really hard making watches.
You know,

462
00:27:12.751 --> 00:27:15.810
it's really hard.
Everything that's done well.
That's right.
That's,

463
00:27:15.811 --> 00:27:18.450
it's really hard.
So true.
Everything is done.
That's so true.

464
00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:19.343
That's why that thing,

465
00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:23.610
dreams of Sushi movie is so fucking interesting because who gives a fuck?

466
00:27:23.611 --> 00:27:24.960
The guys just make it Sushi.

467
00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:29.680
Like I tried to get me to watch that his parents didn't like him.
Remember?
Yeah.

468
00:27:29.790 --> 00:27:32.430
He said my parents didn't like me.
Yeah,
that's good.

469
00:27:32.431 --> 00:27:35.190
Tries him actually he looked like he was going to cry and he was 90.

470
00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:38.490
When was that expression that they use?
What's that expression to use?

471
00:27:38.491 --> 00:27:41.220
Where a guy who's just a complete master at something,

472
00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:44.280
I forget what the expression,
well I stroll or no,
no,
no,

473
00:27:44.281 --> 00:27:46.150
it's a Japanese expression,
um,

474
00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:51.260
that they were using to describe how this guy who had worked so meticulously on

475
00:27:51.901 --> 00:27:53.280
creating this egg dish,

476
00:27:53.730 --> 00:27:57.120
he remember he was making that egg dish for like a year and he just couldn't get

477
00:27:57.121 --> 00:27:59.770
it right.
And one day the guy,
you know,

478
00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:03.990
said you got it right and then gave him this Japanese,
see if you can find it.

479
00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:05.730
Whatever the fuck it is from the movie.

480
00:28:05.731 --> 00:28:09.060
Jiro dreams of Sushi and see if you can find what that was one of his,

481
00:28:09.061 --> 00:28:12.200
it was one of his apprentices who just kept having that there for controlling

482
00:28:12.210 --> 00:28:15.090
the custard away.
Finally.
Got It.
Right.

483
00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:19.290
They have this weird egg dish they make and it has to be perfect.
It's like,

484
00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:24.360
I'm not sure how they're doing it,
but eventually,
eventually after a year,

485
00:28:24.361 --> 00:28:27.930
this guy got it right and he was so happy.
He said he cried.

486
00:28:28.290 --> 00:28:31.920
Show couldn't show Koonin yeah.
Show congeal.
Koonin what is it?

487
00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:36.240
What is the definition?
Does it have like a Wikipedia definition was,
it's a show.

488
00:28:36.241 --> 00:28:41.220
Koonin she'll cook here.
I'll show how spell it.
That's h.

489
00:28:41.270 --> 00:28:45.360
O.
K.
U.
N.
I.
N.
Okay.

490
00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:48.870
Show Koonin the Japanese word show.
Koonin.

491
00:28:50.670 --> 00:28:53.800
Okay.
Did that guy that didn't really translated,
uh,

492
00:28:53.850 --> 00:28:57.270
artists and craftsmen who feel deep obligation.

493
00:28:57.990 --> 00:29:01.650
It's why I don't like pedal it political correctness because I think it's a lie.

494
00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:03.120
I think we were,
we,
you know,

495
00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:07.170
we live in a culture that is always telling you you have to feel good and I

496
00:29:07.171 --> 00:29:11.200
think anything worth it,
anything worth it,
it takes exactly what you're talking.

497
00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:13.770
I don't think there's anything wrong with wanting to feel good.

498
00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:18.420
I think the real issue with political correctness says that it avoids intent and

499
00:29:18.421 --> 00:29:22.710
it,
it ignores the complex subtleties of human communication.

500
00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:27.210
It ignores the reality that one person could say something.
How about this?

501
00:29:27.211 --> 00:29:31.950
You can say something one time and it's offensive and you could say the same

502
00:29:31.951 --> 00:29:35.790
thing when you're in a better mood and a better situation and it's hilarious.

503
00:29:36.210 --> 00:29:39.990
You could be in the wrong state of mind when you say it or you could say it

504
00:29:39.991 --> 00:29:42.130
clumsily and don't accept it.

505
00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:42.701
<v 0>You can know.</v>

506
00:29:42.701 --> 00:29:46.270
You could say it after something that people might think it's insensitive if you

507
00:29:46.271 --> 00:29:48.280
said it,
they're not willing to go along on the ride with you.

508
00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:53.550
Or You could say that same thing in front of the same people in a different

509
00:29:53.621 --> 00:29:56.380
circumstance and they get how laughing.
I think you're the funniest guy ever.

510
00:29:56.381 --> 00:29:58.690
I can't believe he said that.
All My god,
he's so crazy.

511
00:29:59.430 --> 00:30:04.430
The political correctness in applies as you apply it to humor.

512
00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:06.010
The big issue,

513
00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:11.040
the number one issue is that humor is almost always about something you didn't

514
00:30:11.441 --> 00:30:15.520
expect or something you can relate to.
And both of those things,

515
00:30:15.521 --> 00:30:19.210
something you can relate to,
you're telling me you can't relate to racist stuff.

516
00:30:19.211 --> 00:30:20.920
Like,
look,

517
00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:24.400
there's certain amount of racist stuff that's fucking hilarious,

518
00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:26.630
including racist stuff against white people.
Right.

519
00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:30.880
When Richard Pryor used to do that,
we know,
oh,
your Mama motherfucker,
my mom,

520
00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:32.260
she's a great old Gal.

521
00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:37.540
That is a racist joke that's making fun of white people that are goofy.

522
00:30:37.541 --> 00:30:39.910
You can't even,
oh Yo Momma,
motherfucker.
You can't,

523
00:30:39.911 --> 00:30:43.180
you can't even say that to them at work.
I mean,
that's racist.
Is it?

524
00:30:43.181 --> 00:30:47.320
Or is it racial?
Is it only racist if a white person does it and racial,

525
00:30:47.321 --> 00:30:51.130
if a black person does it?
I mean,
what is it?
It's,
it's a type of humor.
Yeah.

526
00:30:51.131 --> 00:30:54.510
Well there's,
there's,
I guess the difference in racism and bigotry.

527
00:30:54.910 --> 00:30:57.190
Bigotry is an individual thing,
right?
So I'm bigoted.

528
00:30:57.220 --> 00:31:00.400
You can be banging it against fat people or whatever.
Whereas racism,

529
00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:04.900
just the definition applies to the institution of racism.

530
00:31:04.901 --> 00:31:05.770
So you're a rat.

531
00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:09.340
So that's why it was always used more sensitively to black people in this

532
00:31:09.341 --> 00:31:13.270
country at least.
Because when you live in a racist society,

533
00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:18.220
the institutions themselves are stacked against you because they were racist.

534
00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:20.950
That's why you can't have a white pride shirt,

535
00:31:21.310 --> 00:31:25.060
but you can have a brown pride shirt if you're Mexican or chain Velasquez was

536
00:31:25.061 --> 00:31:25.894
tattoo.
That's right.

537
00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:29.890
Like Roy Nelson joked around like fucking glass Glasgow's and had a white pride

538
00:31:30.290 --> 00:31:33.540
tattoo on his chest,
like the brown pride on canes chest.

539
00:31:33.550 --> 00:31:37.760
What would anybody be able to do?
I mean,
there's something to that,
right?

540
00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:42.310
But there's not,
because of course,
no one owned white people.

541
00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:46.510
There wasn't a bunch of white people that were kidnapped over in Iceland and

542
00:31:46.511 --> 00:31:49.570
thrown onto a fucking slave ship and dragged over to America.

543
00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:52.030
Your texts was so funny about,
I don't know if I can even say it,

544
00:31:52.031 --> 00:31:56.100
but when I was like,
they're honoring women in film.
Can I say it?
Yeah.

545
00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:56.950
Say you're like,

546
00:31:56.950 --> 00:32:00.370
you're like a women in film having women always been in film and then you go,

547
00:32:00.490 --> 00:32:02.650
what did they have?
What if they honored white men in film?

548
00:32:02.651 --> 00:32:04.300
I wonder what would happen then?
What?

549
00:32:04.301 --> 00:32:08.500
What kind of an uproar that if you had an thing honoring men in film,

550
00:32:09.490 --> 00:32:12.400
right.
Especially because you could do black men,

551
00:32:12.730 --> 00:32:16.480
black men in film like that would be like a,
like a real black tie affair.

552
00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:21.340
You would go there and dressing your best but on your shiny shoes.

553
00:32:21.550 --> 00:32:24.910
But what I said was you said it's women in film,

554
00:32:24.911 --> 00:32:29.480
like aren't women in every movie,
right.
The basically in every movie crack me.

555
00:32:29.530 --> 00:32:33.470
How many movies don't have women?
Well they all to you like,

556
00:32:33.790 --> 00:32:37.460
haven't they always been a movie?
He said always an f at forever.
I was like,
yeah,

557
00:32:37.461 --> 00:32:42.080
they have,
I mean,
yeah,
they've done some awesome shit.
I don't have a problem.

558
00:32:42.081 --> 00:32:43.130
This is my issue.

559
00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:47.210
I don't have a problem with them honoring women in film at all.

560
00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:48.590
I have no problem.

561
00:32:48.890 --> 00:32:53.890
I point out like what if they want to do white men in film because I know that

562
00:32:53.901 --> 00:32:55.430
there would be a massive outrage.

563
00:32:56.060 --> 00:33:00.080
I except the fact that people want to honor only women in film.

564
00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:04.880
I accept the fact that I bet for women it's pretty fucking frustrating sometimes

565
00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:09.860
because I bet a lot of movies that women go to or just not geared for women.

566
00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:14.630
You know,
there's a lot of movies,
like if you go and see,
you know,

567
00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:18.410
transformers that was,
that's probably geared towards anybody.

568
00:33:18.411 --> 00:33:22.820
They'd probably cut that bitch right down the middle with stats and graphs and

569
00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:26.540
they probably get phone calls and fucking brought in people to analyze it.

570
00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:29.530
They probably cut that bitch right down the middle.
Men and women,

571
00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:32.660
they'd probably give you just enough mushy bullshit so that women go Google for

572
00:33:32.690 --> 00:33:35.840
my girlfriend would say,
Ugh,
if I go,
hey,
let's watch transformers.

573
00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:38.740
That would be her reaction.
She's smart though.

574
00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:41.660
What they were honoring deer hunter.
Yeah.
Like here's the movie,

575
00:33:41.661 --> 00:33:45.440
the deer hunter to fucked up movie man.
Chicks don't want to see a movie.

576
00:33:45.441 --> 00:33:47.180
Whereas Mau,
Mau,
Mau,

577
00:33:47.490 --> 00:33:50.510
they've got the fucking gun by the head and you know he's eventually gonna shoot

578
00:33:50.511 --> 00:33:53.540
himself and they're playing there became an actor that I became an active

579
00:33:53.541 --> 00:33:54.270
because that same,

580
00:33:54.270 --> 00:33:57.410
we keep calling this fucking amazing movie and you never see the deer hunter.

581
00:33:57.411 --> 00:34:01.160
It's one of those movies from the 70s but is it like 71 or something like that?

582
00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:05.630
One best picture in 1978 was it that late?
Oh Wow.

583
00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:07.430
Why did I think it was it?
Either way.

584
00:34:07.790 --> 00:34:10.990
It's from an era where a lot of the movies don't hold up.
Yeah.

585
00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:13.910
Those seventies movies,
man,
some of them are tough to watch.

586
00:34:14.150 --> 00:34:17.030
Not the fucking deer hunter.
Holy Shit.
That's a good movie.

587
00:34:17.330 --> 00:34:21.800
That was so beyond anything at the time.
Yeah.
Shocking.
Shocking.

588
00:34:21.890 --> 00:34:24.600
When he shoots himself in the head and grabs him know,

589
00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:30.110
oh are heartbreaking.
Cried when I saw that I was at an age where I just thought,

590
00:34:30.111 --> 00:34:32.780
first of all,
I took movies seriously and second of all,
I never got over that.

591
00:34:32.781 --> 00:34:35.810
I was like,
ah,
I don't know what that is.
That movie was incredible.

592
00:34:35.811 --> 00:34:38.150
That was Robert De Niro.
When he was a mother and a great,

593
00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:42.410
the greatest at that point.
And Christopher Walker,
he was a motherfucker.

594
00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:45.890
Motherfucker.
Yeah.
Christopher Walken.
You give them a good role.

595
00:34:45.891 --> 00:34:50.270
He's still a motherfucker.
He still carries this creepy power to them.

596
00:34:50.330 --> 00:34:54.350
I watched that.
Uh,
the,
the,
uh,
awesome scene from pulp fiction.
Um,

597
00:34:55.110 --> 00:34:58.210
I know romance from True Romance.
That's the great scene.

598
00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:00.650
That's the greatest thing.
I didn't really like the scene in pulp fiction.

599
00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:03.690
I was like,
I get it.
The watch was up your ass.
I loved it.

600
00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:07.580
I didn't buy it for some reason.
I love the movie,
but I'm like,
that seems like,

601
00:35:07.610 --> 00:35:12.080
come on,
get out of here with this watch.
I know.
Again,
it's up your ass,
you know,

602
00:35:12.081 --> 00:35:14.720
I dunno,
whatever.
For whatever reason,
it didn't work for me,

603
00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:18.500
but him and true romance.
You know who I am,
Mister Wally.

604
00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:23.300
I'm the antichrist.
You got me.
And they'd been let it kind of mood what to do,

605
00:35:23.301 --> 00:35:25.730
a little Q and a at the risk of sounding redundant,

606
00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:27.620
try to make the answers genuine.

607
00:35:28.610 --> 00:35:31.220
So it was so creepy when he did it too,

608
00:35:31.221 --> 00:35:34.130
because it's the words like the tone.

609
00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:39.060
It's a very originally Christopher Walken type of delivery.
I had never,

610
00:35:39.061 --> 00:35:42.390
I couldn't believe that saint,
I was like,
what?
I said,

611
00:35:42.391 --> 00:35:45.390
we'll do a little pantomime is the pantomime guy.

612
00:35:45.391 --> 00:35:46.800
He gives himself 17 whatever it is,

613
00:35:46.801 --> 00:35:48.840
17 different movements that girls 21 but anyway,

614
00:35:49.170 --> 00:35:52.920
it just goes through this whole where it's like this fucking Pool Hustlers,

615
00:35:52.921 --> 00:35:56.760
movie pool hall junkies.
As people tried to tell me that was good.
Oh God.

616
00:35:57.990 --> 00:36:02.610
Oh God.
Fucking awful.
And this scene,
the lion in the jungle,

617
00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:05.070
it's not a good scene.
And everybody told me it's like this.

618
00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:08.900
It gives us great speech.
I'm like,
Oh that movie is dog shit.
Yeah,

619
00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:11.700
people would still recommend it.
Like was awesome.

620
00:36:11.701 --> 00:36:14.700
King of New York was great too and he gives a speech was amazing in that.

621
00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:17.970
The problem with that pool hall movies,
no one could really play pool.

622
00:36:18.030 --> 00:36:20.460
They're all like whacking balls around and shit like they don't,

623
00:36:20.490 --> 00:36:22.080
they're not really playing pool.

624
00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:24.810
You can't have a movie where you don't even teach the guy out to play pool.

625
00:36:24.990 --> 00:36:27.660
It's got to look at least a little bit like you can actually play pool.

626
00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:31.980
This is offensive and it's just like,
come on,
this is like,
it's so goofy.

627
00:36:31.981 --> 00:36:35.070
The guy who doesn't want to get the job,
it's like,
why do you like pull so much?

628
00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:40.260
I have no idea.
Yeah.
I learned it at a formative age,
you know,
learned it.
Uh,

629
00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:41.350
when it's,

630
00:36:41.410 --> 00:36:46.410
it helped me transfer a lot of focus and energy that I probably would have put

631
00:36:47.371 --> 00:36:50.250
into bad places.
Yeah.
You know,
man,
you're good.

632
00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:51.970
You ran a table I think three times man.

633
00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:55.860
Shop or like just try it on a table three times.
It's kind of,
I play a lot.

634
00:36:55.861 --> 00:36:58.830
I got this table right here.
Yeah.
It's a stupid thing to get good at.

635
00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:02.340
I totally freely admitted like people go more golf.
But you play pool.

636
00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:06.020
Did I mark everything?
I mark my own family golf cause she'll get,
yeah,

637
00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:10.530
I'm playing golf.
Mock everybody.
I mock myself,
I mock you.
I mocked me.

638
00:37:10.531 --> 00:37:13.230
I mock golf,
I mock every fucking thing there is.

639
00:37:13.231 --> 00:37:17.790
I'm on Mock Pink Ribbons for breast cancer and walking for aids.
I'm mock at all.

640
00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:22.560
Everything's Mokbel birth can suck my dick.

641
00:37:22.561 --> 00:37:25.680
Every one of them I'm mocking.
Bird sold me with their freedoms.

642
00:37:26.090 --> 00:37:30.270
I'm down with mockingbirds get it.
Come on.
I mean,

643
00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:34.980
I think the more I can laugh,
the better.
And I find the,

644
00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:36.540
the happier I am.

645
00:37:36.541 --> 00:37:40.410
Like I was listening to a Jim Norton on the radio today on the open Anthony
show.

646
00:37:40.411 --> 00:37:44.460
He's telling a story of him and Jim Florentine about how Jim Norton was jerking

647
00:37:44.461 --> 00:37:46.980
off in the backseat of his car while they were driving home from a Gig.

648
00:37:48.530 --> 00:37:53.250
He had met a girl and he was so excited.
It was so funny.
I was fucking crying,

649
00:37:53.310 --> 00:37:54.570
laughing because he had met her and he wanted,

650
00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:58.200
he wanted to jerk off before he got together with her.
What he,
no,
no.

651
00:37:58.201 --> 00:38:01.080
He met her and it didn't work out.
He hooked up with her,
like,
you know,

652
00:38:01.410 --> 00:38:03.840
maybe like touch,
she touched him or something like that.

653
00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:06.780
And then he had to go and he was so fired up that he had a jerk off.

654
00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:10.320
So he jerked off in the car in the backseat and they were telling the story and

655
00:38:10.330 --> 00:38:11.430
was fucking hilarious.

656
00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:14.190
And they were telling the story how is busting each other's balls.
And it was,

657
00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:18.750
it was genuinely enjoyable for both them and for me,
it's like,

658
00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:21.570
it's fun.
Listen,
but people don't,
you know,

659
00:38:21.571 --> 00:38:23.280
there's some people that just can't handle it.

660
00:38:23.281 --> 00:38:25.740
I want to be laughing or learning everything else in the big,

661
00:38:25.741 --> 00:38:28.260
in the middle I was like boring.
I guess I'll eat and sleep,

662
00:38:28.261 --> 00:38:32.250
but over there all I have a problem with being stupid.
I love being stupid,

663
00:38:32.251 --> 00:38:34.890
but they have a problem with it.
You know what I mean?
People don't like being,

664
00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:36.160
because

665
00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:39.250
<v 2>a lot of times when they're being mocked,
there's no humor to it.</v>

666
00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:41.530
Or if there is a humor,
it's a very mean humor.

667
00:38:41.650 --> 00:38:43.900
Like there's some humor that's just not fun.

668
00:38:43.901 --> 00:38:46.900
It was back to that same thing about politically correct.
Can we laugh at it?

669
00:38:46.901 --> 00:38:49.030
You know,
every academic I have on my podcast,
you know,

670
00:38:49.031 --> 00:38:51.670
I love having all the academics,
every single one of them,

671
00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:54.250
every single one of them says basically says to me,

672
00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:57.700
what kills me is how politically correct I have to be in my classroom.

673
00:38:57.860 --> 00:39:02.860
If I'm not,
if I'm not,
I could get in huge trouble.
So if you're a Harvard,

674
00:39:02.861 --> 00:39:07.450
Yale Faculty,
you better be speaking for everyone,

675
00:39:07.451 --> 00:39:12.220
including Paul Pennies and tribes.
And you know,
I mean it doesn't matter man.

676
00:39:12.250 --> 00:39:16.270
If you say anything,
if you even say it,
it's just an unbelievable man.

677
00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:18.790
And that's the number one complaint I hear from him.
Okay.

678
00:39:18.791 --> 00:39:20.440
But here's the big question.
This is the sort of,

679
00:39:20.441 --> 00:39:22.840
the question that I had with Thaddeus Russell,

680
00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:24.850
and we talked about it yesterday with Rory too,

681
00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:30.180
is is this a sign of some sort of social progress that we're like springing back

682
00:39:30.611 --> 00:39:33.550
so far?
The other way that it's just,
it's,

683
00:39:33.730 --> 00:39:38.730
it's rebounding like some of the loss ground that was given up when they,

684
00:39:39.730 --> 00:39:44.440
when they had things like separate fucking fountains for men.

685
00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:47.320
When women could get raped,
no one would do anything about it.

686
00:39:47.321 --> 00:39:50.770
When cops would literally ask someone,
what were you wearing when you got raped?

687
00:39:51.010 --> 00:39:53.080
I mean,
all the different things that have happened,

688
00:39:53.081 --> 00:39:57.130
all the different times that people have been homophobic or you know,

689
00:39:57.160 --> 00:40:00.520
outwardly sexist,
both from towards men and towards women,

690
00:40:00.610 --> 00:40:04.120
that the bigger the reaction that is happening now like this,

691
00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:07.750
this big below back,
this big politically correct,
left wing,

692
00:40:07.751 --> 00:40:12.400
progressive push that may be,
it's just like the waves of the ocean,

693
00:40:12.401 --> 00:40:14.110
like we were talking about earlier,
the Yin and the Yang,

694
00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:17.860
that you need the evil to have the good and sometimes you need the good to just

695
00:40:17.861 --> 00:40:21.430
blow the fuck up.
So even the evils like,
okay,
I think,

696
00:40:21.450 --> 00:40:25.210
I think the answer is yes,
that the wave is,
is pushing in the other direction.

697
00:40:25.211 --> 00:40:27.970
However,
it's a good direction.
It's a good direction.
However,

698
00:40:27.971 --> 00:40:30.910
you've got to make sure it doesn't.
It doesn't,
it doesn't get too crazy.

699
00:40:30.911 --> 00:40:33.970
It doesn't become it's own form of tyranny and it doesn't get in the way of the

700
00:40:33.971 --> 00:40:36.520
truth.
Also,
you have to realize that some people,

701
00:40:36.610 --> 00:40:41.610
they use an ideology to get out their aggression and they can choose to decide

702
00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:45.880
that it's relevant or justified.

703
00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:50.080
And in doing so what they are is stressed out,

704
00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:55.210
fucked up people who have a lot of tension in their lives and they have a cause

705
00:40:55.270 --> 00:41:00.270
and they find a cause that they agree with that makes intellectual sense and

706
00:41:00.851 --> 00:41:05.851
then is supported by other people and then they aggressively pursue that cost.

707
00:41:06.011 --> 00:41:09.640
The point of calling people out and being nasty and vicious,

708
00:41:09.730 --> 00:41:13.240
what are they really doing though?
I'll tell you what they're really doing.

709
00:41:13.330 --> 00:41:17.590
They're using a cause to be an asshole.
Why?

710
00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:19.360
Because they're assholes.

711
00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:24.520
They're assholes that support a good idea and they're doing it totally the wrong

712
00:41:24.671 --> 00:41:28.510
way.
And in doing so the wrong way and being super aggressive and asshole ish,

713
00:41:28.690 --> 00:41:32.350
what you're doing is you're strengthening up the resistance to that.

714
00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:34.070
So if your asshole ish,

715
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:35.690
<v 1>like in a right wing sort of a way,</v>

716
00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:40.220
you're going to make a bunch of asshole leftwing people that are forced deal

717
00:41:40.221 --> 00:41:42.650
with your bullshit,
right?
But consequently,

718
00:41:42.770 --> 00:41:46.370
if your asshole ish from a left wing point of view and you want everything

719
00:41:46.371 --> 00:41:50.780
politically correct and it's not,
it's not freshmen,
it's fresh people.

720
00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:54.620
I mean you're,
you're dealing with that kind of shit,
which is stupid nonsense.

721
00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:58.610
I'll give you an amazing example of this.
I mean,
and it became a fierce,

722
00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:03.380
fierce debate when,
when,
uh,
you're right.
No,
no,
fucking terrible.

723
00:42:03.770 --> 00:42:06.890
The Sally swing.
Oh,
for heaven's sake,
he spilled his coffee everywhere.

724
00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:11.420
I didn't spill it out,
like actually kept the coffee in my hand.
There it is.

725
00:42:11.421 --> 00:42:15.290
Not Bad.
Not Bad,
but it was my Sally swing chair,

726
00:42:15.291 --> 00:42:19.610
which I love is a,
on some serious rollers.
Very good.
I got it.

727
00:42:19.611 --> 00:42:21.800
It was very little coffee.
But this is,

728
00:42:21.801 --> 00:42:25.320
this is a classic example of one of the biggest debates,
intellectual debates,

729
00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:27.980
what,
which was the,

730
00:42:28.010 --> 00:42:32.450
when it used to be that everybody would talk about human beings and it was,

731
00:42:32.570 --> 00:42:35.270
it was sort of married to a Marxist ideology.

732
00:42:35.271 --> 00:42:38.990
The idea that human beings started zero.
We are all a blank slate.

733
00:42:38.991 --> 00:42:43.991
So every child is what is a blank slate and whatever you socially put on it will

734
00:42:44.450 --> 00:42:47.960
actually be so.
So who says boy should play with guns?

735
00:42:47.961 --> 00:42:50.930
They should also be given dogs and we'll make the world a better place and

736
00:42:50.931 --> 00:42:53.330
people,
men won't be as aggressive.
And the question is learned.

737
00:42:53.570 --> 00:42:56.540
It is an inherent and innate.
That was the dogma.

738
00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:59.690
And then a bunch of evolutionary scientists started doing a lot of,
uh,

739
00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:00.561
a lot of work.

740
00:43:00.561 --> 00:43:04.370
Like Steven pinker and Steven pinker wrote a book called the blank slate.

741
00:43:04.370 --> 00:43:07.160
And a large part of the book is chronicles the,

742
00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:10.550
when the evolutionary biologist who studied,
for example,
the,
uh,

743
00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:11.160
what are the names,

744
00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:14.720
the Yanno Mano that take up a hundreds of tens of thousands of miles in the

745
00:43:14.721 --> 00:43:16.700
Amazon basin.
The,
the,

746
00:43:16.850 --> 00:43:21.850
the men that had killed more in battle sired more children had more wives.

747
00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:27.830
And when that anthropologist came back with that and said,

748
00:43:27.831 --> 00:43:32.831
I'm studying indigenous cultures here where aggression not only is seems to be

749
00:43:33.291 --> 00:43:37.160
natural cause not exposed to the western ideas of what it,
what aggression is,

750
00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:41.810
but they fight all the time.
They,
they had a lot of tribal warfare.
It also,

751
00:43:41.811 --> 00:43:43.400
when they come back to their tribes,

752
00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:47.930
it also seems to be that they are more attractive to females.
Well,

753
00:43:47.931 --> 00:43:52.931
when he came back and said that the people that had held the blank slate theory

754
00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:57.710
went crazy and attacked all those guys,

755
00:43:57.711 --> 00:44:01.520
attack that guy in a number of other people.
Uh,
they attacked him personally,

756
00:44:01.740 --> 00:44:05.060
called them liars.
They're fudging their data and everything else.
Of course.

757
00:44:05.061 --> 00:44:09.500
Now we know with Steven Pinker's work in these guys and almost all evolutionary

758
00:44:09.501 --> 00:44:11.450
biologist agree that you are born.

759
00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:14.570
People are born like we were talking about with different proclivities,

760
00:44:14.571 --> 00:44:17.330
but human beings,
pretty much every culture we've ever studied,

761
00:44:17.910 --> 00:44:21.740
they fight what direction is his humility?
It's malleable.

762
00:44:21.770 --> 00:44:25.280
Human beings are malleable.
Yes,
they have very ideally the,

763
00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:30.300
they have tendencies that tend to be exhibited in their relatives and especially

764
00:44:30.651 --> 00:44:32.190
in their,
and we've known

765
00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:33.990
<v 2>that with dogs forever.</v>

766
00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:38.550
The fact that we think that it doesn't exist in humans when it exists so clearly

767
00:44:38.551 --> 00:44:43.180
in dogs like Joe,
the guy bought Johnny from the massive,
yeah,

768
00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:47.400
he won't breed a dog if it's aggressive to people.
He won't let it breed.

769
00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:51.690
He'll fix him.
He'll fix the mail and if it's a female he'll get her fixed too.

770
00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:53.010
And he just,
if anyone,

771
00:44:53.011 --> 00:44:57.610
that's a trip that they exhibit any aggression towards people done any direct

772
00:44:57.630 --> 00:45:01.500
aggression towards dogs,
not interested,
not interested.
What let them breed.

773
00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:05.760
So because you've met my dog,
he's the sweetest dog ever and he's so nice.

774
00:45:05.970 --> 00:45:07.230
He's just so gentle.

775
00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:10.100
Like my four year old would play with them and I don't work and he's like

776
00:45:10.110 --> 00:45:14.940
fucking big dog.
But I never worry about scratch and crawl,

777
00:45:14.941 --> 00:45:16.750
fight and hunts for existence.

778
00:45:16.751 --> 00:45:20.310
Do you don't think that aggression is going to be an evolutionary necessity?

779
00:45:20.370 --> 00:45:24.930
It is.
Well how bout dogs?
How about the dog that you used to have?
Ah,
came bread.

780
00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:29.960
Exactly that crazy dog like a fucking doesn't goats to go to a baby cow and

781
00:45:31.381 --> 00:45:34.650
broke the legs of a German shepherd.
And what?
What was up with that dog?

782
00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:39.570
That dog was being bred for fighting.
That dog was a whirlwind.

783
00:45:39.810 --> 00:45:43.470
That dog couldn't wait to get its teeth on something.
That's what it lived for.

784
00:45:43.620 --> 00:45:47.970
It was hypercharged.
It was like it was on 10 all the time.
I loved that dog.

785
00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:50.610
I'd go over here and it was a little dog too.
That's what people don't realize.

786
00:45:50.730 --> 00:45:53.300
People both skinny be called the real pit bulls.

787
00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:57.150
They used to fight them where they apparently still do the parts of the country

788
00:45:57.330 --> 00:46:01.200
that like 35 pounds.
That's a big one.
Yeah.
They're small dogs.
Yeah.

789
00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:04.740
The big ones get tired apparently.
Like those big dogs.

790
00:46:04.770 --> 00:46:08.980
It's just like UFC fighters like to see those big dogs that are like the,

791
00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:11.160
those super monster pit bulls.

792
00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:14.310
They would never fight that as they fight the little separate.
Tim Kennedy's,

793
00:46:14.311 --> 00:46:17.940
he seems never to.
Ted Kennedy seems to just grind you down.

794
00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:21.660
He's a fucking tough Prek.
Ah.
This is a tough Prek.
What'd you think of that?
What?

795
00:46:21.661 --> 00:46:23.570
What?
What are they going to,
what did you think about that?
A,

796
00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:26.190
I'm sorry to jump over now,
but no,
it's okay.
Yeah.

797
00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:30.150
For folks who don't know what we're talking about,
Yoel Romero,
who is this

798
00:46:31.770 --> 00:46:35.550
dud wrestler from Cuba?
Two time world champion.
Yeah.
He's one.

799
00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:40.580
He's won a metal in every single wrestling tournament he entered pretty much.

800
00:46:41.550 --> 00:46:44.250
I mean,
he metal,
he was a silver medalist in the Olympics.

801
00:46:44.550 --> 00:46:48.990
He medaled in the world cop.
I mean just,
he's a fucking freak wrestler.

802
00:46:49.020 --> 00:46:52.830
Cael Sanderson was grace one of the greatest amateur wrestlers of all time.

803
00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:56.310
Yoel Romero beat him twice,
twice.
I mean,

804
00:46:56.311 --> 00:46:59.460
he has that much of a freak when you see him in the octagon.
I almost wish,

805
00:46:59.550 --> 00:47:03.220
cause he's only 30,
he's 37 years old.
I almost wish we got him when he was 27.

806
00:47:03.270 --> 00:47:06.540
God,
you know,
I mean God,
10 years of that guy in MMA.

807
00:47:06.810 --> 00:47:09.990
But it was hard for him to get over from Cuba to America.
Um,

808
00:47:10.530 --> 00:47:14.730
but he fought this Guy Tim Kennedy and for the first round he was beating that

809
00:47:14.731 --> 00:47:17.310
ass.
He was beating Tim Kennedy's ass.

810
00:47:17.340 --> 00:47:21.330
It was just speed and it was connection.
He,
every time he would hit Kenny,

811
00:47:21.390 --> 00:47:24.910
but Kenny so fucking tough.
Okay.
So fucking tough.
He,

812
00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:29.710
his strategy was just to make this guy work,
to stay there,
gang in asam gas.

813
00:47:29.711 --> 00:47:33.490
I'm out.
And so he starts attacking in the sac around and you see Ramiro braking.

814
00:47:33.670 --> 00:47:35.590
You see him slowly started to get exhausted,

815
00:47:35.591 --> 00:47:38.450
and Kennedy is just working him constantly working.

816
00:47:38.451 --> 00:47:41.500
I'm constantly making a breathe and then the end of the round he cracks some.

817
00:47:41.590 --> 00:47:43.870
But if you didn't see the controversy on Kennedy's side,

818
00:47:44.230 --> 00:47:49.230
there's a video of Kennedy Holden Romero's glove pull this video up.

819
00:47:49.391 --> 00:47:54.120
What?
Kennedy Holds Romero's glove.
Oh boy.
But it's put,

820
00:47:54.121 --> 00:47:57.100
it's like there's an animated Gif that probably would show it just as good.

821
00:47:57.340 --> 00:48:00.830
It's hard to look at and be,
um,

822
00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:03.370
be like a objective about it.

823
00:48:03.371 --> 00:48:07.030
Because if you look at just the instance where he's grabbing the glove,

824
00:48:07.420 --> 00:48:11.500
it clearly looks like he's cheating and he's landing a couple punches while he's

825
00:48:11.501 --> 00:48:13.780
holding onto the inside of someone's gloves.
So they can't use their arm.

826
00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:16.660
But when you watch it,
it in real time,

827
00:48:16.930 --> 00:48:21.670
in the full context of the fight,
you realized it was a fraction of a second.

828
00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:23.740
Yeah.
And there was haymakers being thrown.

829
00:48:23.741 --> 00:48:27.320
He was holding onto his arm and it just so happened that for Latin,

830
00:48:27.340 --> 00:48:32.290
not even a second,
he had his hand inside the glove.
Okay,
but that's,

831
00:48:32.350 --> 00:48:34.000
that's not,
that's just a photograph.

832
00:48:34.001 --> 00:48:37.240
You want to see the animated Gif cause the animated Gif,
he goes from that,

833
00:48:37.330 --> 00:48:39.460
which is he's holding the wrist wear.
The glove is,

834
00:48:39.461 --> 00:48:43.660
which is totally acceptable to,
as he's punching for a brief moment,

835
00:48:43.661 --> 00:48:44.920
his fingers went in there,

836
00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:48.250
but then after that is when he connected with some pretty big shots at the end

837
00:48:48.251 --> 00:48:52.230
of the round.
Like I honestly,
I'd looked at it a few times.
Very objectively.

838
00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:55.330
I've had,
see what's,
let's play it again.
Play it again from the beginning.
I'll,

839
00:48:55.331 --> 00:48:57.610
that's a split second.
He's just fighting and not only that,

840
00:48:57.611 --> 00:49:01.600
this is all in slow motion.
It's a split second in slow motion.

841
00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:02.920
So let's see it again.
See,

842
00:49:02.921 --> 00:49:07.780
grab bome it's like not even a second got caught.

843
00:49:07.781 --> 00:49:09.640
I think it looks like that he was sliding down.

844
00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:13.180
He was in the middle of fucking combat.
That's what was going on.

845
00:49:13.181 --> 00:49:16.780
He was a beast right there.
Just swinging toffee is,
he's got it.

846
00:49:16.810 --> 00:49:18.920
He's got a hold of the glove man.
I don't know.

847
00:49:20.110 --> 00:49:24.250
It looks like it's a problem is it's happening in slow motion.

848
00:49:24.251 --> 00:49:28.540
It looks like you found it.
Well,
he definitely slid down,
but one too.

849
00:49:28.660 --> 00:49:31.510
I want to know how,
see the thing is though,
in the real fight,

850
00:49:31.810 --> 00:49:36.400
I don't even know if that was like he realized he was holding it and he let go.

851
00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:38.200
I mean how much time was he holding it?

852
00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:40.210
Let's see if he could find the real videoing.

853
00:49:40.211 --> 00:49:42.510
And right now he doesn't forget about this because this,

854
00:49:42.511 --> 00:49:46.780
this is not even half speed.
We need to find the real video.
Find the real video.

855
00:49:46.781 --> 00:49:49.690
So we will look at it in real time.
But look,
I was calling it,
I didn't notice it.

856
00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:51.850
If I noticed that,
I would have definitely said something.

857
00:49:52.210 --> 00:49:54.790
I thought that a very short time,
even in slow motion,

858
00:49:54.970 --> 00:49:59.410
it was way more fucked up was that Romero was sitting on a stool in between

859
00:49:59.411 --> 00:50:02.050
rounds.
They didn't make him stand up.
They didn't take a stool away.

860
00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:06.400
There was 29 seconds between the end of the second round when he was fucking on

861
00:50:06.401 --> 00:50:10.720
Queer Street.
He was on the corner of Queer Street and Queer Boulevard.

862
00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:15.340
He was right there crying.
He got fucking rocked man.

863
00:50:15.341 --> 00:50:19.510
He walked back to his corner liquor drunk.
That 30 seconds is giant.

864
00:50:19.570 --> 00:50:21.070
Whose fault is that?
Well,
you know,

865
00:50:21.071 --> 00:50:24.910
they said like 10 Kenny was saying his corner put too much Vaseline on them.

866
00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:28.700
See that's what's wrong because it's the corners that use the Vaseline.

867
00:50:28.701 --> 00:50:30.770
It's the UFC cut man that use the Vaseline.

868
00:50:31.250 --> 00:50:35.150
And so the UFC is science cutman weaves the same cut men for every event.

869
00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:37.790
And we just,
yeah,
yeah.
Impartial cut man.

870
00:50:38.030 --> 00:50:40.700
I mean I certainly have friends and they,
you know,

871
00:50:40.710 --> 00:50:43.880
I'm not saying it's impossible that someone would leave extra grease on,

872
00:50:44.180 --> 00:50:47.360
but I think they left the east extra grease on his life cause he had a giant
cut.

873
00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:50.000
I saw his cut man.
His cut was huge.

874
00:50:50.210 --> 00:50:54.140
Get a huge cut where his eyebrow was like a good solid inch and a half long.

875
00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:57.770
It was a big fucking cut and it was bleeding and so they closed.

876
00:50:57.771 --> 00:51:00.110
They stopped the blood and they put the the Vaseline on it,

877
00:51:00.111 --> 00:51:03.110
but that's just what they do.
The thing was,
John,

878
00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:07.400
he recognized the Vaseline and start talking about the Vaseline mostly because

879
00:51:07.401 --> 00:51:10.040
Romero was still on the stool and people were still in there,

880
00:51:10.220 --> 00:51:13.340
so he was correcting them already.
He was saying,
you got to get out,
get out,

881
00:51:13.341 --> 00:51:15.170
seconds out.
Let's go,
let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.

882
00:51:15.530 --> 00:51:19.340
He's got too much Vaseline on like he,
if Ramiro was standing up,

883
00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:22.220
they might've said there was too much Vaseline on and it would have taken two

884
00:51:22.221 --> 00:51:24.740
seconds for them to wipe it off.
Turn two of them.
Good.
Okay.

885
00:51:24.741 --> 00:51:29.240
Fight like a few seconds.
Yeah,
but he still sat on that stool.

886
00:51:29.730 --> 00:51:32.680
He sat on that still just sat there.
[inaudible] he knows her.

887
00:51:32.810 --> 00:51:36.320
Tim Kennedy's in front of them going,
what the fuck?
Get up like what's going on?

888
00:51:36.410 --> 00:51:40.880
And he's still just sitting on the stool.
That should be it.
They should've.

889
00:51:41.020 --> 00:51:43.440
John should have called the fight right there.
Did you?

890
00:51:43.441 --> 00:51:46.850
You can't just sit on the stool.
Why didn't you take the stool out?
This guy is,

891
00:51:46.851 --> 00:51:49.310
but he doesn't want to do that.
See,
because if he does that,

892
00:51:49.311 --> 00:51:52.030
then the fight doesn't go on and everybody misses the finality of,

893
00:51:52.031 --> 00:51:53.870
and they get mad at him.
They got mad at him.

894
00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:59.390
He was going to knock him the fuck out.
You shave the bullshit.
It's right.

895
00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:03.030
So I think John did.
John wanted to,
he knew we wanted to see more fun.

896
00:52:03.410 --> 00:52:07.010
Don't rob us of the fighting John.
But you can't let that happen.

897
00:52:07.130 --> 00:52:09.260
And it's like you don't expect it to happen.

898
00:52:09.261 --> 00:52:14.180
But I guess you have to be diligent with a some corners who they know,

899
00:52:14.181 --> 00:52:16.880
they know how to fucking get their way out of a situation.

900
00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:18.890
They know that they can look.

901
00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:23.180
Angelo Dundee was on the greatest trainers of all time and when Henry Cooper was

902
00:52:23.181 --> 00:52:26.510
fighting Ali Henry Cooper cracked.
I'll leave with a left hook.

903
00:52:26.511 --> 00:52:30.620
He had a vicious left,
took Ali's legs,
gave out and he fucking crumpled.

904
00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:34.580
And In between rounds,
Angelo Dundee realized that Ali was out.

905
00:52:34.581 --> 00:52:38.540
So he cut his gloves off.
Yup.
Right.
Here we go.
Is this a real time?
Yeah.
Okay.

906
00:52:38.541 --> 00:52:42.200
Let's see.
In real time.
Back it up a little bit because that's,
that's wait.
Yeah,

907
00:52:42.201 --> 00:52:45.800
that's good.
This is just a highlight reel,
so,
okay.

908
00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:50.690
Let's see if we can see that in the highlight reel.
Boy.
What's up with youtube?

909
00:52:50.900 --> 00:52:53.540
It's mostly this laptop.
Is it really?
Yeah.

910
00:52:54.910 --> 00:52:56.530
<v 3>Hmm.
Hold on a sec.</v>

911
00:52:57.820 --> 00:53:00.370
<v 2>Well,
now that we have those new things,
can we not use the laptop?</v>

912
00:53:00.371 --> 00:53:01.540
Now that we have the new connection,
Jamie?

913
00:53:02.930 --> 00:53:03.763
<v 3>Different.</v>

914
00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:07.120
<v 2>All right,
we'll fix that man.
Tell me what to do and fix that.</v>

915
00:53:07.510 --> 00:53:12.460
Tired of that stupid laptop.
So I talked to bullshit.
Bullshit.
It's funny,

916
00:53:12.461 --> 00:53:14.350
man.
Laptops have a couple of years ago.

917
00:53:14.380 --> 00:53:17.590
They just don't want to deal with all the new shit.
You're a techie.

918
00:53:17.591 --> 00:53:21.370
What about the iPhone six I'm not a real techie.
No,
no.
Not by any stretch.

919
00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:25.410
You have caps on sex.
I'm a tech fan boy.
Fanboy.
Ask.
Yeah,
true.

920
00:53:25.470 --> 00:53:28.320
But I don't really know much.
There you go.
Here we go.
Real life.

921
00:53:30.660 --> 00:53:35.250
Yeah.
That's holding on.
Yeah.
That's real.
Yeah,
that's real time.
Yeah,

922
00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:38.850
but that's,
that's real time slid down it.
Hockey definitely did,

923
00:53:38.851 --> 00:53:42.950
but he was definitely holding the glove the in real time.
But again,
um,

924
00:53:42.990 --> 00:53:44.910
did he realize he was doing it?
It's,
it's,

925
00:53:44.911 --> 00:53:47.430
there's an argument could be made that he didn't realize he was doing it,

926
00:53:47.431 --> 00:53:49.920
but there's also an argument that can be made that he had to know when he's

927
00:53:49.921 --> 00:53:54.100
doing it,
but he's fucking in full animal frenzy.
Right.

928
00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:58.560
There's a difference between that and not getting up off the stool.

929
00:53:58.770 --> 00:54:01.200
Getting off off the stool is totally a hundred percent calculator.

930
00:54:01.210 --> 00:54:04.810
There's no animal frenzy at all.
That's like two and a half punches though.
Yup.

931
00:54:05.380 --> 00:54:09.990
No,
it's totally legit.
Just moving forward.
Let's talk,
I mean,

932
00:54:09.991 --> 00:54:12.960
if you wanted to time it,
I mean it might've been assessing strategy though.

933
00:54:12.961 --> 00:54:14.940
I don't think it was.
I'm going to grab that glove.
It doesn't feel like that.

934
00:54:14.941 --> 00:54:17.250
It feels like he bought a number of times for the hand.

935
00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:21.390
It's enough time to know that he's holding it and then he lets it go.

936
00:54:21.790 --> 00:54:25.340
See he's holding onto it.
Boom.
Yeah.
But the first one was,
no,
the first,
no,
no,
no,

937
00:54:25.420 --> 00:54:28.960
no,
no,
no,
no.
The first one he's holding wear.
The glove is that's legal,
right?

938
00:54:28.980 --> 00:54:32.220
You're allowed to hold the glove.
What you're not allowed to do is this,
Brian,

939
00:54:32.310 --> 00:54:35.400
put your fingers inside the glove,
right?
That's what you see.
You're,

940
00:54:35.401 --> 00:54:39.870
you're misjudging it.
It's probably not if you're saying a bunch of punches,

941
00:54:40.020 --> 00:54:43.620
but that's not the case because he's holding the glove in the beginning.

942
00:54:43.621 --> 00:54:45.090
So he's holding the wrist and the glove.

943
00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:49.680
Then as Romero is trying to pull away some of the fingers go into the glove for

944
00:54:49.681 --> 00:54:51.310
a second.
But you're incorrect.
Correct.

945
00:54:51.330 --> 00:54:53.280
If you think that it's illegal to hold the gloves,
right.

946
00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:57.000
So I think that's one of the reasons why people think this is more grievous than

947
00:54:57.001 --> 00:55:00.450
it is.
I don't think it has at all.
If,
if you,
if he knew what he was doing,

948
00:55:00.451 --> 00:55:04.350
it was one second less than that.
If he knew he would was doing it is illegal.

949
00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:06.240
It's illegal.
What he did for sure,

950
00:55:06.390 --> 00:55:11.390
and it is in the middle of this fucking battle royale right moment where he's

951
00:55:12.271 --> 00:55:15.780
connected.
So you know,
I holy,

952
00:55:15.781 --> 00:55:17.700
he knows whether or not he knew what he was doing.

953
00:55:18.090 --> 00:55:22.410
I would imagine when you're a fighter and you're in that wild scrambled for your

954
00:55:22.411 --> 00:55:24.720
life against a stud like Yoel Romero,
yeah.

955
00:55:24.810 --> 00:55:28.500
You're probably in a pure animal state.
Yeah.
Just reacting on instincts.

956
00:55:28.501 --> 00:55:30.150
He's been smashed in the head.

957
00:55:30.151 --> 00:55:33.420
Who knows how many fucking times in that first round and in the Sacramento,

958
00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:38.190
me Ramiro cracked him with some big shots and he's a spooky Stryker and then at

959
00:55:38.191 --> 00:55:39.390
the end he knocked him out.

960
00:55:39.391 --> 00:55:43.130
Ramiro Ramiro sitting on the stool like that is a way bigger.
Controversial.

961
00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:46.830
Then Tim Arrow new,
the round was over.
He knew the round was over.

962
00:55:46.831 --> 00:55:51.690
He knew he was getting extra break.
100%.
Yeah,
1000 million percent.

963
00:55:51.880 --> 00:55:55.500
He was sitting there,
Kennedy was in front of them saying,
what's going on?
Get up,

964
00:55:55.620 --> 00:55:58.620
get up.
And he's still just sat there.
Yup.

965
00:55:59.190 --> 00:56:04.190
I mean that extra 29 seconds was fucking gigantic because after this is over,

966
00:56:07.020 --> 00:56:10.830
this fucking combination,
boom,
boom,
and look at this one.
Bam,
Bam.

967
00:56:10.831 --> 00:56:14.730
That lasts left and right hand afterwards and another one,
dude,

968
00:56:15.140 --> 00:56:18.570
Romero can take it like almost nobody I've ever seen.
Amazing.

969
00:56:18.630 --> 00:56:22.500
He fucked Derek Brunson.
Derek Brunson.
Head kicked him.

970
00:56:22.540 --> 00:56:25.870
Coleen switch kick to the head.
Boom.

971
00:56:25.871 --> 00:56:30.250
He ate it like it was candy didn't even buckle,
dude.

972
00:56:30.251 --> 00:56:33.760
It was crazy for war.
Totally built for war.

973
00:56:33.950 --> 00:56:38.110
Did he got Shinde on the neck and just ate it like it was nothing.

974
00:56:38.930 --> 00:56:42.490
It's so ridiculous.
It's so ridiculous because I remember watching that fight.

975
00:56:42.491 --> 00:56:46.150
I don't believe I called that fight.
I think that was a Kenny Florian fight,

976
00:56:46.360 --> 00:56:49.990
but I think I was watching at home going,
get the fuck outta here.

977
00:56:50.170 --> 00:56:53.710
How did that guy got hit with that?
He just,
he just ate it.
Different human being,

978
00:56:53.770 --> 00:56:58.540
but he didn't even tumble like whack.
I get what?
What?
No,

979
00:56:58.580 --> 00:57:02.440
he looks as close to a superhero as you get.
I mean you don't get more feed out.

980
00:57:02.530 --> 00:57:03.550
It's just ridiculous.

981
00:57:03.551 --> 00:57:08.000
There's a picture of Romero with Hector Lombard and Tiago al.
See,

982
00:57:08.020 --> 00:57:12.110
it's the most preposterous picture and it's like there's so ridiculously

983
00:57:12.130 --> 00:57:14.860
muscular.
What kind of jeans are you dealing with?

984
00:57:14.861 --> 00:57:19.360
These gladiator genes or these three guys have even Tiago looks somewhat

985
00:57:19.361 --> 00:57:21.790
diminutive next to those guys like Jack and little lumbar.

986
00:57:21.791 --> 00:57:24.520
He looks like a normal dude.
Almost like Antioch was far from it.

987
00:57:25.130 --> 00:57:27.670
It was unbelievable.
Man.
Next to her Merrill and Lombard,

988
00:57:27.800 --> 00:57:32.680
there's someone above them,
Cuban jeans,
man tube and jeans or something else.

989
00:57:32.830 --> 00:57:34.750
Different things.
And Oh,
by the way,
you've been,

990
00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:37.840
you've been throwing dudes around your whole life.
Yeah.
On a high level.
Well,

991
00:57:37.841 --> 00:57:42.700
there was that boxer from the 1970s I believe his name was Teofilo Stevenson,

992
00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:46.450
Stephen's or Stevenson,
but they always wanted him to fight Ali.

993
00:57:46.450 --> 00:57:48.460
They always wanting to get him from Cuba.
He was like,

994
00:57:48.461 --> 00:57:51.790
this amateur would win all the amateur tournaments,
and everybody was like,

995
00:57:51.791 --> 00:57:56.140
this ain't fair.
Because Americans get to a certain level.
They're amateurs.

996
00:57:56.290 --> 00:57:59.380
They get to a certain level,
they turn pro,
but the Cubans never turned pro.

997
00:57:59.381 --> 00:58:01.840
So they're always amateurs,
but they're being paid by Cuba.

998
00:58:01.990 --> 00:58:04.960
So you've got these guys were in their late thirties when boxing their whole

999
00:58:04.961 --> 00:58:07.930
life,
fighting 18 year old kids and just lighting him up.

1000
00:58:08.290 --> 00:58:11.200
And that's what you had with like the Cuban boxing team.
And everybody would say,

1001
00:58:11.201 --> 00:58:14.890
oh,
the Cuban box teams the best look,
without a doubt,
they're very skillful.

1002
00:58:14.950 --> 00:58:15.850
Very skillful,

1003
00:58:15.940 --> 00:58:20.940
but recognize that they're competing far longer as amateurs than anyone in

1004
00:58:21.791 --> 00:58:24.730
America.
I mean that's just what it was.
And then when Solon,

1005
00:58:24.750 --> 00:58:29.200
the Americans were still winning like in the 76 Olympics and Mark Brie Lind and

1006
00:58:29.201 --> 00:58:32.800
Pernell Whitaker and Meldrick Taylor.
Was that 76 was that Roy?
No,

1007
00:58:32.890 --> 00:58:37.180
76 was Ray Leonard.
That was 88 80 88 was it?

1008
00:58:37.181 --> 00:58:42.000
I think it was 80,
I think it was 88 who are 80 80 1980 year mark.

1009
00:58:42.070 --> 00:58:46.900
Mark [inaudible] 88 wasn't it?
Was it rise?
I don't think so.

1010
00:58:48.430 --> 00:58:53.080
Whatever happened to Mark Wheeler.
He's a,
he's coaching people now,
Huh?
Yeah,

1011
00:58:53.081 --> 00:58:57.820
he um,
1984.
Oh,
okay.
Gold metal in 1984 Olympics.

1012
00:58:59.080 --> 00:59:01.690
Yeah,
he was a bad motherfucker.
I just rewatched them product.
The point is,

1013
00:59:01.960 --> 00:59:04.120
those were all,
those were all kids.

1014
00:59:04.330 --> 00:59:07.210
Those were all kids that took on in some countries,
like,

1015
00:59:07.270 --> 00:59:11.080
you know when you were facing Cuban boxers and amateur tournaments or sometimes

1016
00:59:11.081 --> 00:59:13.330
there's Soviet Union.
Yeah,
there were grown men.

1017
00:59:13.331 --> 00:59:15.820
They weren't going to fight professionally.
There was no professional fighting.

1018
00:59:16.420 --> 00:59:19.630
You know,
that was always the deal with a certain Soviet boxers,

1019
00:59:19.840 --> 00:59:22.100
but Soviet boxing has really taken off now

1020
00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:26.060
<v 0>with kinetic cannon and the other guy's phone.
Man.
It's a whole shitload of them.</v>

1021
00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:27.620
Who's going to fight?
Who's the Russian?

1022
00:59:27.621 --> 00:59:29.960
I keep forgetting prop to cough or whatever.
Who's going to fight?

1023
00:59:30.230 --> 00:59:32.450
Providing the cough?
I,
no,
no,
no.
That's not his name.

1024
00:59:32.480 --> 00:59:36.080
The guy who's going to fight Bernard Hopkins.
Max.
Yeah.
Killer.
Yeah.

1025
00:59:36.081 --> 00:59:39.560
He's a bad motherfucker.
I don't remember his name.

1026
00:59:39.561 --> 00:59:42.480
I just saw him fight a few weeks ago.
Can I think of that?
No.

1027
00:59:42.770 --> 00:59:46.040
Connecticut off Glenna is the middleweight guy,
right?
Yeah.
He's,

1028
00:59:46.041 --> 00:59:50.870
he fights it 54 or something.
Let's say Bernard Hopkins.

1029
00:59:50.871 --> 00:59:54.200
Next fight.
Yeah.
That Russian guy's scary,

1030
00:59:54.230 --> 00:59:58.050
but Hopkins is a ridiculous freak.
Colette,
Sergio Colaveccha,

1031
00:59:58.130 --> 01:00:02.690
Colt Kovalev.
Sergio live calls.
I love.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's a beast.

1032
01:00:03.350 --> 01:00:07.070
It's fascinating that Bernard Hopkins is still boxing the shit out of these guys

1033
01:00:07.071 --> 01:00:07.341
though.

1034
01:00:07.341 --> 01:00:12.140
At 49 years of age and hunting going after guys.

1035
01:00:12.340 --> 01:00:14.360
This,
this guy who hits it was,
I don't think he's,

1036
01:00:14.570 --> 01:00:16.040
I think he's not that everybody's fought.
Yeah.

1037
01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:20.030
Including killed a guy in the ring.
What?
Yes.
He killed the guy.
He did.

1038
01:00:20.390 --> 01:00:24.500
But let you get that.
That's a fact.
For Real.
Yep.
How'd he know this?

1039
01:00:25.310 --> 01:00:28.600
I've read about him.
Cova live killed a man.
All right.
Yeah.
Oh Wow.

1040
01:00:29.410 --> 01:00:33.720
Killed a man called wow.
It's,
if you Google it,
it comes up really quickly.
Yeah.

1041
01:00:34.940 --> 01:00:39.890
So He's a killer.
Wow.
Hard hits.
Boxer dies in the ring.

1042
01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:44.480
Yeah.
His name was Roman Simak cough.
There's a video of it.

1043
01:00:45.410 --> 01:00:48.290
And Kovalev didn't give a fuck.
Well,
I don't know.
I mean,

1044
01:00:48.291 --> 01:00:50.470
I don't want to say that,
but I mean,
he certainly didn't,

1045
01:00:50.471 --> 01:00:52.400
it didn't hurt his boxing.
He just kept boxing.

1046
01:00:52.460 --> 01:00:53.930
That's what people are terrified of.
Right.

1047
01:00:54.370 --> 01:00:57.350
Can kill a guy and then go right back and be just as good.

1048
01:00:57.351 --> 01:01:00.680
And he's got really weird power.
I mean,
he really hurts dudes.
And if you see,

1049
01:01:00.910 --> 01:01:04.220
we'll see what happens when there's highlights of when he hits him and they just

1050
01:01:04.221 --> 01:01:07.250
go,
what,
what's this?
Oh,
I'm getting hit.
Oh,
this is a different thing.

1051
01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:10.850
Totally hit by a sparring partner like this or in the gym.
This is different.

1052
01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.450
Yeah.
And Golovkin is kind of the same way and had a left can hits that hard,

1053
01:01:14.530 --> 01:01:18.500
like,
yeah,
there's a lot of those Soviet guys who could just fucking crack you.

1054
01:01:18.790 --> 01:01:23.030
It's weird.
Well,
they have an excellent,
the amateur system is so good.

1055
01:01:23.660 --> 01:01:27.730
It's just like the Cuban system.
Yeah,
and poured it and a lot of them,

1056
01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:31.040
they're starting out.
Let me see that.
Is that the,
the fight where the guy died?

1057
01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:32.630
Oh,
pull it up to the beginning.

1058
01:01:34.210 --> 01:01:35.043
<v 5>That's bad.</v>

1059
01:01:36.930 --> 01:01:38.490
<v 0>Sometimes guys also,</v>

1060
01:01:38.670 --> 01:01:42.720
and this is a reality of boxing sometimes guys come into the,

1061
01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:45.690
the ring itself already damaged from sparring.

1062
01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:51.120
No one's job was talking about how he used to spar with Shane Carwyn and he

1063
01:01:51.121 --> 01:01:54.780
would have fights and he was fucked up when he went into the fight.
Like he said,

1064
01:01:54.781 --> 01:01:58.220
when he fought a Ben Rothwell,
he's like,
dude,
I got Kod.

1065
01:01:58.230 --> 01:02:02.430
Just like not long before the fight by Shane sparring with Shane.

1066
01:02:02.670 --> 01:02:07.500
It that they say that a lot of boxes were ruined in the gym wars.
Oh fuck.
Yeah.

1067
01:02:08.010 --> 01:02:10.620
Yeah.
I mean,
guys have died in gym wars too,
by the way.

1068
01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:14.400
100% this guy's a murderer,
man.
He's,
I mean,

1069
01:02:14.460 --> 01:02:17.320
I didn't mean that and that way I meant like he just hits the road.

1070
01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:20.130
He didn't mean to kill.
This guy obviously was boxing.
You know,

1071
01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:22.710
it might not have been his fault at all.
I mean,
like I said,

1072
01:02:22.711 --> 01:02:25.620
that guy could have gone into the cage already fucked up.
Yup.

1073
01:02:25.830 --> 01:02:28.500
It's very po into the ring rather.
Yeah.
It's very,

1074
01:02:28.501 --> 01:02:30.990
very possible that he had a preexisting condition.

1075
01:02:30.991 --> 01:02:34.830
It's very possible that it was from all the damages he took while sparring.

1076
01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:39.380
It's very possible that he cut a lot of weight in tragedy.

1077
01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:42.170
It's awful.
I hate seeing that.

1078
01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:46.740
Like a great a fighter who gives his whole life and then it's just the worst
man.

1079
01:02:46.770 --> 01:02:49.950
How about when Roy Jones Jr got carried out of the ring and now we're seeing

1080
01:02:49.951 --> 01:02:53.940
them fight again.
He's back at it.
It went to sleep.
Oh he went,

1081
01:02:54.030 --> 01:02:59.030
he was in total parallel universes that the one with Glen Johnson.

1082
01:02:59.370 --> 01:03:02.640
Yeah,
those are the,
those are the,
that's the damage that you,
they say,
you know,

1083
01:03:02.641 --> 01:03:05.700
walk away from,
that's the scary one.
You go out for a long time.

1084
01:03:05.700 --> 01:03:09.680
Like when Manny Pacquiao got my mark has knocked it,

1085
01:03:09.681 --> 01:03:12.000
hit him with that left hook or whatever.
I mean he was just,

1086
01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:16.080
it's not just getting hit there and then falling on your face.
Yup.

1087
01:03:16.110 --> 01:03:18.750
That's bad too.
You know,
that's probably as bad.

1088
01:03:19.260 --> 01:03:22.180
That thing that happens to guys when they bounce their head off the canvas.
Yeah.

1089
01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:23.520
That's just as bad.

1090
01:03:24.270 --> 01:03:26.940
Cause you see like when a lot of guys get like viciously knocked out,

1091
01:03:26.970 --> 01:03:29.800
it's one of the things that that does it.
I remember when I'm,

1092
01:03:29.900 --> 01:03:34.200
Mike Mccallum fought Donald Curry.
I used to be a big Donald Curry fam.

1093
01:03:34.230 --> 01:03:38.640
Donald Curry was a sick boxer man in the 1980s.
He was sick.

1094
01:03:39.030 --> 01:03:42.540
He had just wicked technique.
Man,
he's just threw everything perfect.

1095
01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:46.530
It didn't have like a big build.
He wasn't built like,
like a monster.

1096
01:03:46.810 --> 01:03:51.410
It just ha you just was a wicked athlete and it really good boxer.
And um,

1097
01:03:52.020 --> 01:03:55.500
he uh,
he cut weight against this Guy Lloyd Huntington.
He was,

1098
01:03:55.890 --> 01:03:57.720
he had a really hard time making one 47.

1099
01:03:57.990 --> 01:04:01.500
And that was back when they just did not know how to rehydrate people correctly.

1100
01:04:01.830 --> 01:04:03.960
They just did a terrible job of rehydrating people.

1101
01:04:04.230 --> 01:04:08.040
And so he had to go up in weight class after that.
I just fought like shit.

1102
01:04:08.220 --> 01:04:11.040
And after that he was never really the same again.

1103
01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:14.310
It's like that one loss one one time get beaten up.

1104
01:04:14.311 --> 01:04:18.180
And one time of like losing the confidence of being the best pound for pound

1105
01:04:18.181 --> 01:04:20.710
fighter in the world.
He was considered the best pound for pound for awhile.

1106
01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:22.273
And um,

1107
01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:25.860
then he fought Mike Mccallum and Mike my column hit him with this left hook to

1108
01:04:25.861 --> 01:04:29.310
the body,
left hook to the chin,
wham Bam.

1109
01:04:29.311 --> 01:04:32.190
And the ones that Chin just sent him flying backwards,

1110
01:04:32.490 --> 01:04:37.140
his head bounced off the canvas.
Blam so Ricky Hatton,

1111
01:04:37.170 --> 01:04:38.660
Ricky Hatton versus down.

1112
01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:42.420
I've seen he got shut off his whole Ang you saw in slow motion.

1113
01:04:42.421 --> 01:04:45.000
His whole head looked like an accordion.
Yeah.
You know,

1114
01:04:45.670 --> 01:04:50.160
what should we published four knockouts now in the UFC or has it stayed the
same?

1115
01:04:50.460 --> 01:04:53.190
People are getting better.
If people are getting better,

1116
01:04:53.191 --> 01:04:58.140
it makes it tougher to hit people,
but they're better at hitting people.

1117
01:04:58.710 --> 01:05:01.140
It depends on the matchups really.
You know,
there's,

1118
01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:06.200
I think there's less people that fight in the UFC now that have one very

1119
01:05:06.871 --> 01:05:10.050
specific discipline,
you know,
and they're missing the other stuff.

1120
01:05:10.051 --> 01:05:13.500
Like you'd never see those,
the grab where's that?
Can't strike it all anymore.

1121
01:05:13.820 --> 01:05:17.350
They're all,
everybody's dangerous on their feet.
Everybody,
every,
I mean,

1122
01:05:17.590 --> 01:05:18.130
they're not

1123
01:05:18.130 --> 01:05:22.920
<v 2>equal.
It's not equal.
Yeah.
But there's a lot of God damn dangerous dudes.</v>

1124
01:05:22.921 --> 01:05:25.870
It's very few people that have that glaring hole in their game.

1125
01:05:25.871 --> 01:05:28.270
So you can't just go in and just beat the shit out of him.

1126
01:05:28.271 --> 01:05:30.910
You got to set them up just like everybody else.
They're athletes.

1127
01:05:30.911 --> 01:05:34.300
They move very fast and if you fuck up and they catch you with something,

1128
01:05:34.301 --> 01:05:37.090
you can get in big trouble,
especially early in a fight.

1129
01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:41.560
So I think that people are just better all across the board.
There's,

1130
01:05:41.770 --> 01:05:44.680
there's better athletes now than there's ever been before.
Guys.
Like,

1131
01:05:44.950 --> 01:05:48.320
like McGregor coming up.
I,
Conor Mcgregor,
he's a fucking kids,

1132
01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:51.310
a tremendous athlete.
Wonderboy Thompson.
Just see that that fine.

1133
01:05:51.340 --> 01:05:54.340
I didn't see that fight.
Jesus Christ that kids could.
He's great.

1134
01:05:54.570 --> 01:05:58.900
It's fucking striking.
Striking.
Since he was like three literally,

1135
01:05:59.020 --> 01:06:02.830
and he's all point style.
His hands are down on this dance sideways.

1136
01:06:02.830 --> 01:06:04.390
Nobody can get on.
I'm getting on them.

1137
01:06:04.391 --> 01:06:07.810
You're eating knuckle sandwiches on foot kicks.
Oh,
I have your thing.

1138
01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:12.100
Throws front leg side to the body,
throws vicious leg kicks,
throw his head kicks.

1139
01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:13.980
I mean he's fucking good.

1140
01:06:13.990 --> 01:06:18.250
He has 57 and oh kickboxing record dude.

1141
01:06:18.310 --> 01:06:20.440
57 57 and Oh,

1142
01:06:20.441 --> 01:06:23.020
and he's just starting to figure out the MMA game he's trying to get,

1143
01:06:23.070 --> 01:06:25.830
he hasn't even so called Avalon.
Right,
exactly.
Yeah.
You see what?

1144
01:06:25.930 --> 01:06:29.770
I think he's a purple belt or a blue belt in Jujitsu is his brother in law I

1145
01:06:29.771 --> 01:06:34.180
think is Carlos Machado.
One of the channels is brother-in-law,
so he's,
you know,

1146
01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:36.910
he's been involved in martial arts essentially his whole life,

1147
01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.470
but it was mostly this a striking.

1148
01:06:38.471 --> 01:06:42.400
So now you're seeing them learn to avoid the take downs and once he's learning

1149
01:06:42.401 --> 01:06:46.990
to avoid the take downs,
he's able to create much more comfortable on his feet.

1150
01:06:47.330 --> 01:06:51.910
Now he's getting loose.
Fuck Dude,
guys landed some ridiculous combinations.
Man.

1151
01:06:51.940 --> 01:06:54.920
Mr Dominick Cruz,
it's looking pretty good.
Ooh,

1152
01:06:56.180 --> 01:06:59.570
insane Brent and tell he trained with him one time he and chilled train and

1153
01:06:59.571 --> 01:07:03.070
Dominick Cruz and both of them at the end of the session they were,

1154
01:07:03.250 --> 01:07:06.970
they were like both basically quiet cause Dominick Cruz is so smart.
He was like,

1155
01:07:06.971 --> 01:07:08.140
no,
when you do this you do this.

1156
01:07:08.141 --> 01:07:11.530
And he was showing them stuff and they were like cow smart as this fucking guy.

1157
01:07:11.710 --> 01:07:14.140
He's very smart.
He's very focused,
you know,
I mean you,

1158
01:07:14.141 --> 01:07:18.070
you see that when you pay attention to his analysis,
he's very good at analyzing.

1159
01:07:18.071 --> 01:07:21.310
Like he did a great breakdown once that I thought was really important for

1160
01:07:21.311 --> 01:07:22.750
people to watch a young fighters,

1161
01:07:22.751 --> 01:07:25.510
especially of when Conley knocked out rich Franklin.

1162
01:07:25.790 --> 01:07:28.030
And he shows like the error that Franklin made.

1163
01:07:28.510 --> 01:07:32.470
Franklin threw a kick and the counter,
like he was right in line for the counter.

1164
01:07:32.620 --> 01:07:34.870
He didn't move his head off the center line at all.
And I'm like,

1165
01:07:34.871 --> 01:07:38.320
this is so important that someone like draws us in a Dj.
He had a diagram,

1166
01:07:38.530 --> 01:07:41.170
you know like one of those things and he's like showing,
you know,

1167
01:07:41.171 --> 01:07:43.780
he's like pointing to the big screen and pointing out all the different,

1168
01:07:43.870 --> 01:07:46.600
you know,
because his hand has always,
always to the side.

1169
01:07:46.660 --> 01:07:49.150
It's almost like Tj Dillashaw like you know,

1170
01:07:49.690 --> 01:07:54.100
like he and Dwayne watched Dominic,
you know.
Oh what they did.
Oh they did.

1171
01:07:54.130 --> 01:07:56.370
Of course that's going to be a fun fight to watch.

1172
01:07:56.410 --> 01:08:01.390
Very fun fight to watch Tj if anybody's emulated Dominick style of movement.

1173
01:08:01.391 --> 01:08:02.610
A lot of it's Tj.
Yeah.

1174
01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:05.530
But Dominic took it to a totally different level the other night.
He,

1175
01:08:05.540 --> 01:08:09.280
he looked like he was on like he was from another planet.

1176
01:08:09.700 --> 01:08:14.170
I mean he was like that.
That was seriously like the next level technique.

1177
01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:18.620
Like next level aggression.
Next level proficiency,
next level accuracy.

1178
01:08:18.890 --> 01:08:22.220
Very good.
Really.
Mitsa [inaudible] he's top five.
Wow.

1179
01:08:22.250 --> 01:08:25.070
He's number five and number six contender.
Wow.
Yeah.

1180
01:08:25.071 --> 01:08:27.800
Mitsui [inaudible] he's very good.
Very good.

1181
01:08:27.830 --> 01:08:30.800
Cause what's one instinct in me has a lot of guys who shine another division,

1182
01:08:30.830 --> 01:08:35.830
other like organizations come over to the USC like watching Dallas Serone in

1183
01:08:36.531 --> 01:08:39.960
that fight against Eddie Alvarez,
Alvarez and Eddie Alvarez is a kid,

1184
01:08:40.010 --> 01:08:44.060
wasn't any hours that belch chimp from us while he's just lost the time.

1185
01:08:44.061 --> 01:08:48.050
You didn't lose the title left and the title and then watching when he comes

1186
01:08:48.051 --> 01:08:52.430
over to the UFC and watching how what Donald's Ronnie did to him,

1187
01:08:52.730 --> 01:08:54.950
it was a real eyeopener for me because he looks like such a,

1188
01:08:54.951 --> 01:08:57.830
he is a killer and he's a great fighter,
but Donald's a different level.

1189
01:08:57.890 --> 01:09:02.180
Donald's got real moy Moitai that real Muay Thai is different than these guys

1190
01:09:02.181 --> 01:09:05.210
that want to be boxers who just occasionally throw kicks.

1191
01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:09.500
There's boxes is occasionally throw kicks and there's guys who have left hook,

1192
01:09:09.530 --> 01:09:13.580
right leg kick ingrained in their genetics.
When Donald's Serone hits you,

1193
01:09:13.581 --> 01:09:16.640
the left kick to the liver,
you better lift up your left leg to check.

1194
01:09:16.990 --> 01:09:20.400
If you don't,
he's coming down hard on that thigh with that Shin.
He,

1195
01:09:20.460 --> 01:09:24.200
he hooks with the left and then chops with the right and it's,
it's in his DNA,

1196
01:09:24.201 --> 01:09:28.670
dude.
He'll throw that straight,
right,
left hook,
right leg kick all day long.

1197
01:09:28.671 --> 01:09:31.850
And you will be in that moment because you're moving away from the left hook.

1198
01:09:32.090 --> 01:09:33.140
You move away from that left Hook,

1199
01:09:33.141 --> 01:09:36.890
you step to your left to avoid the punch that coming from shy down.

1200
01:09:37.070 --> 01:09:40.650
And he chops that right leg kick right on your thigh.
And he's as an overnight.

1201
01:09:40.890 --> 01:09:44.930
He's timing that knee every time you go in for a single leg,
good luck.
Boom.

1202
01:09:44.990 --> 01:09:47.870
You know who does that awesome as Josie Aldo.
Yeah.
They called the Duchy,

1203
01:09:47.871 --> 01:09:49.760
the yell out in his corner,
the Duchy,
the Duchy.

1204
01:09:49.940 --> 01:09:52.370
Cause it's a classic Dutch combination.

1205
01:09:52.371 --> 01:09:57.080
Dutch kickboxing being like one of the most talent rich countries ever for

1206
01:09:57.081 --> 01:10:01.010
kickboxing was Holland.
Like beyond,
above and beyond.

1207
01:10:01.250 --> 01:10:03.170
So many great fighters came from Holland.

1208
01:10:03.171 --> 01:10:07.790
It's almost insane if he thinks Nesto who's Badr?
Hari boss.

1209
01:10:07.791 --> 01:10:12.400
Rutan um,
rob came in who is arguably the greatest of all time,
uh,

1210
01:10:12.570 --> 01:10:12.920
uh,

1211
01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:17.920
Ramon Dekkers who's also are arguably the greatest of all time deckers and boss

1212
01:10:18.190 --> 01:10:20.810
wouldn't you when you think the decker bus route and it's like one of the

1213
01:10:21.060 --> 01:10:24.440
greatest strikers to ever enter into MMA.
And one of the reasons,

1214
01:10:24.441 --> 01:10:28.790
cause he had that MMA striking training from Holland,

1215
01:10:29.070 --> 01:10:32.930
it was all like dealing with high level kickboxing training.
You know,

1216
01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:37.790
Peter Arts,
I mean just you can get,
keep going on and on and on.

1217
01:10:37.940 --> 01:10:41.750
The great kickboxers that came out of Holland,
the training in Holland,

1218
01:10:41.870 --> 01:10:45.230
even guys who aren't from home,
like Tyrone Spong,
he learned in Holland,

1219
01:10:45.380 --> 01:10:48.680
he developed that Holland style.
But Melvin Manhoef,

1220
01:10:48.910 --> 01:10:50.490
Collin Keller monsters,

1221
01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:54.500
there's like the kickboxing is so high level there man,

1222
01:10:54.650 --> 01:10:58.310
just ridiculously high level.
So they would always call that out the Duchy,

1223
01:10:58.311 --> 01:11:01.970
the Dutchy and that's that left hook left hook to the body,
right leg kick.

1224
01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:05.750
Aldo throws it like a fucking Ballerina.
Crazy.
It's like art form.

1225
01:11:05.751 --> 01:11:07.310
When he throws it,
it's like,
Ooh.

1226
01:11:07.311 --> 01:11:09.060
Like he just spun in the air like it was doing a,

1227
01:11:09.470 --> 01:11:11.940
like he was a figure skater or something.
He's trying to say.

1228
01:11:12.110 --> 01:11:14.610
I want to see that I'm dying to see Mcgregor.

1229
01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:18.540
Although now of course who isn't well I'm dying to see Aldo versus Chad Mendez

1230
01:11:18.541 --> 01:11:22.050
to men.
Mendez has improved.
It's striking.
But uh,

1231
01:11:22.170 --> 01:11:24.030
although is always a motherfucker,

1232
01:11:24.140 --> 01:11:27.360
man is going to have a hard time because he's so short and stocking.

1233
01:11:27.370 --> 01:11:31.230
It feels like he's going to have a very hard time getting close to a McGregor

1234
01:11:31.231 --> 01:11:33.450
man.
He just fights it a different distance.
Yeah,

1235
01:11:33.451 --> 01:11:35.510
well that's why we want to see them fight.
You know,

1236
01:11:35.570 --> 01:11:38.970
it's always interesting when someone has a big task to deal with.

1237
01:11:38.971 --> 01:11:41.670
But the other task is we've never seen McGregor fight.

1238
01:11:41.671 --> 01:11:44.670
A guy who's a monster wrestler like Mendez Mendez,

1239
01:11:44.690 --> 01:11:49.530
a super athlete and a monster wrestler.
Like what happens in,
he gets taken down.

1240
01:11:49.690 --> 01:11:51.420
How,
how well does he fight off of his back?

1241
01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:53.580
How well does he do when he gets Clegg weeded,

1242
01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:57.060
let Kuwait Clegg Weda did Anthony Pettis just stuck on them like blue and

1243
01:11:57.061 --> 01:12:00.120
dragged him to the ground and made a stalemate out of it.
What does he do then?

1244
01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:04.560
And that's a beautiful thing about watching contenders with various styles go at

1245
01:12:04.561 --> 01:12:08.310
it is that you get to chance to see like from a strategic standpoint,

1246
01:12:08.340 --> 01:12:11.610
there's so many variables.
Like there's kind of,

1247
01:12:11.611 --> 01:12:13.920
there's some variables and boxing and kickboxing,

1248
01:12:13.921 --> 01:12:16.800
there's movement and different combinations you could throw.

1249
01:12:16.950 --> 01:12:20.640
But the variables between striking and grappling and the transitions between

1250
01:12:20.641 --> 01:12:24.870
those two or what makes MMA so fucking exciting and some of the things that

1251
01:12:24.871 --> 01:12:28.230
people boo at and they get bummed out about like a Clegg.

1252
01:12:28.231 --> 01:12:31.620
We'd up stifling Anthony Pettis to the point where he can't get anything off.

1253
01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:34.390
Those are good.
You have to see though,

1254
01:12:34.690 --> 01:12:36.360
cause you got to know that a guy can do that.

1255
01:12:36.510 --> 01:12:39.000
Because when you see a guy like Conor McGregor was just running through

1256
01:12:39.001 --> 01:12:40.140
everybody,
you go,
okay,

1257
01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:45.440
what happens if you fight a guy who just has a lightning shot that you can't

1258
01:12:46.231 --> 01:12:48.570
stop?
Like Josh Koscheck and his prime.

1259
01:12:48.780 --> 01:12:51.900
A guy who just like lightning shot.
Yeah,

1260
01:12:51.910 --> 01:12:56.040
just drives you across the cage like you're a fucking pillow and tosses it in

1261
01:12:56.041 --> 01:12:59.820
the air and slams you on your back.
You're like,
oh,
next level shit.
Different.

1262
01:12:59.850 --> 01:13:02.850
What do you do?
How do you react?
Yeah,
and we don't know that yet.

1263
01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:06.420
That's one of the cool things about watching different styles.
Go at it.

1264
01:13:06.450 --> 01:13:09.990
You don't know what the fuck is going to happen.
I mean,
Mcgregor could hook,

1265
01:13:09.991 --> 01:13:12.200
kick him in the face.
He could do something crazy thing.

1266
01:13:12.270 --> 01:13:15.000
He threw his hook kick because firstly I don't think I've ever seen that in the

1267
01:13:15.001 --> 01:13:17.330
essay.
Very rare.
Straight up taekwondo hookah.
Yeah.

1268
01:13:17.340 --> 01:13:20.820
I mean cro cop's thrown a couple,
but it was almost like,

1269
01:13:20.821 --> 01:13:22.680
it was almost like this is how much respect I have for you.

1270
01:13:22.681 --> 01:13:26.100
I'm going to hook kick at you.
If you are good at it,

1271
01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:29.730
you've got a good chance of landing it because people don't expect it.
Right.

1272
01:13:29.731 --> 01:13:32.760
It's like this Guy Larry Kelly,
we've talked about him on the podcast before.

1273
01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:36.450
He was a guy in Boston that was known to have a really good hook kick.

1274
01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:39.900
He was known for it.
Bill,
super foot walls,
had a really good hook here.

1275
01:13:40.170 --> 01:13:43.200
This Guy Larry Kelly,
back when Billy blanks used to be a point fighter,

1276
01:13:43.590 --> 01:13:46.950
he hook kick Billy blanks and the head and sent him flying across the thing

1277
01:13:46.980 --> 01:13:49.200
unconscious.
One of the greatest.

1278
01:13:49.201 --> 01:13:52.530
The one thing I never find it Larry Kelly Kaos Billy blanks.

1279
01:13:52.740 --> 01:13:55.350
I know we've shown it on the podcast before,
but it was,

1280
01:13:55.380 --> 01:13:59.130
it's a weird kick to get good at because it's an awkward movement of the body,

1281
01:13:59.430 --> 01:14:02.990
but if you practice it,
you can get it like everything else.

1282
01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:04.860
Like the wheel kicks a wheel weird kick.
Yeah.

1283
01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:08.640
But once you learn how to distribute your weight properly and whip yourself

1284
01:14:08.641 --> 01:14:11.040
through it,
it becomes like easy or at

1285
01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:15.310
<v 0>you can use ingrained,
you can use it.
Yeah.
So same thing with the hook kick.</v>

1286
01:14:15.430 --> 01:14:17.500
I never really developed a good hook,
kick me any of that.

1287
01:14:17.590 --> 01:14:20.650
I used to hate practicing it.
It was always a thing we used to be like,
all right,

1288
01:14:20.651 --> 01:14:24.100
here's hook,
Keck,
let's move on.
I want to do round house,
but it's good though.

1289
01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:29.310
I just,
I wish I had,
you know,
like here it is.
Watch this is,

1290
01:14:29.311 --> 01:14:33.760
this is crazy.
Boom Dude.
Hook,
kick to the face.

1291
01:14:35.500 --> 01:14:38.140
What's the,
what's that one more time Larry Kelly was,
uh,

1292
01:14:38.220 --> 01:14:40.180
I was living in Boston and this guy was,
um,

1293
01:14:40.690 --> 01:14:45.040
Laurie Kelly plan one of the karate guys that you'd hear about in the western

1294
01:14:45.041 --> 01:14:48.070
Massachusetts area.
He was like one of the best at this style,

1295
01:14:48.130 --> 01:14:52.300
this point style of karate fighting,
which there was some,
boom,
look at that shit.

1296
01:14:53.020 --> 01:14:55.360
Thought it was gonna be a slide side kick I think.
Yeah.

1297
01:14:55.361 --> 01:14:58.510
And he's just slid back and caught a right on the job.
Yeah.

1298
01:14:58.511 --> 01:15:01.000
There was a bunch of those guys who was Billy blanks and there was a couple of

1299
01:15:01.001 --> 01:15:02.440
other guys that,
I don't remember the name.

1300
01:15:02.590 --> 01:15:06.820
There's one guy named Mafia Holloway who was this big yoked up black dude who

1301
01:15:06.821 --> 01:15:08.960
was like super fucking fast taekwondo guys.

1302
01:15:09.430 --> 01:15:12.970
When you watch like someone that's took karate guy so he kicks so hard and I

1303
01:15:12.971 --> 01:15:15.970
mean if you get caught in the head with those cakes like we'll kick roundhouse.

1304
01:15:16.150 --> 01:15:19.150
Good luck.
No dislike.
Yeah,
there was a lot of those guys very,

1305
01:15:19.151 --> 01:15:23.540
very fast and especially if you try to fight him at that style because that

1306
01:15:23.541 --> 01:15:25.480
style,
what it is they,
they were lunge in,

1307
01:15:25.481 --> 01:15:29.110
they hit each other and then they break the action up.
It's real weird.
It's like,

1308
01:15:29.140 --> 01:15:30.220
but there's something good.

1309
01:15:30.221 --> 01:15:34.390
The idea behind it is kind of silly because the idea is really based on this

1310
01:15:34.391 --> 01:15:38.710
notion that karate man,
it's too deadly to ever land more than one punch.

1311
01:15:38.830 --> 01:15:40.990
And that even when you land like they would get,

1312
01:15:40.991 --> 01:15:45.040
people get in trouble for excessive contact.
Like you can hit too hard,

1313
01:15:45.460 --> 01:15:48.530
you'll get disqualified.
But I think it's funny that tie to karate,
taekwondo,

1314
01:15:48.570 --> 01:15:52.380
those,
a lot of those moves like Hook,
kick and slide sidekick and roundhouse,

1315
01:15:52.381 --> 01:15:53.050
you know,

1316
01:15:53.050 --> 01:15:56.510
the way they do it in taekwondo or are kind of just becoming more relevant now

1317
01:15:56.790 --> 01:16:01.690
in MMA.
But what I was really good to have distance.
What I was going to say is,

1318
01:16:01.730 --> 01:16:06.730
the good thing about the breaking it up is that you have to learn how to close

1319
01:16:07.241 --> 01:16:07.811
that distance.

1320
01:16:07.811 --> 01:16:11.560
The best way you can like that was the emphasis was entirely on closing the

1321
01:16:11.561 --> 01:16:15.970
distance and landing.
The emphasis was not on doing anything after that.

1322
01:16:16.090 --> 01:16:20.320
So once they learned how to close that distance,
like Ruth with ridiculous speed,

1323
01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:23.620
if you fight people that are used to only continuous fighting,

1324
01:16:23.830 --> 01:16:27.040
oftentimes that's not something they're good at because it's too dangerous.

1325
01:16:27.220 --> 01:16:30.220
You don't just launch yourself across the ring at somebody.
Cause if you do,

1326
01:16:30.221 --> 01:16:32.950
you get get fucked up man and less.

1327
01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:36.940
You're really good at launching yourself across the ring and being evasive.

1328
01:16:36.970 --> 01:16:40.360
And one of the best ways to do that is to learn how to play tag.

1329
01:16:40.630 --> 01:16:42.670
And that's essentially what these karate guys are doing.

1330
01:16:43.180 --> 01:16:46.690
And if you can learn how to play tag way better than anybody else,

1331
01:16:46.691 --> 01:16:50.260
that's how fucking giant advantage.
And that is what Conor McGregor is doing.

1332
01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:52.210
That's what Wonderboy Thompson is doing.

1333
01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:56.890
What these guys are doing is they're incorporating a point style of fighting and

1334
01:16:56.891 --> 01:17:01.260
the people who are used to that Moy Thai style or a taekwondo style like in

1335
01:17:01.261 --> 01:17:05.590
point fighting like you know,
or um,
uh,
continuous fighting there.

1336
01:17:05.591 --> 01:17:06.490
They're not used to it.

1337
01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:10.730
They're not used to someone who launches themselves like such fluidity across

1338
01:17:10.731 --> 01:17:14.130
the cage like that,
that Hook kick,
no,
you reaching,

1339
01:17:14.270 --> 01:17:16.160
he wouldn't do that in a more Thai fight.
No,

1340
01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:18.980
because you would never develop it that good.
Right?

1341
01:17:19.010 --> 01:17:21.620
Cause the to have that as your approach over and over and over again,

1342
01:17:21.621 --> 01:17:22.730
it's really ridiculous,
right?

1343
01:17:22.731 --> 01:17:24.890
Somebody is going to know what you're doing and then going to chop your leg,

1344
01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:28.040
but they can't when you get so good at it because you've done it to this

1345
01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:31.520
incredible level of proficiency.
So they develop like a,

1346
01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:35.570
it's a weird jump and this is the same thing with taekwondo in a way,

1347
01:17:35.870 --> 01:17:39.620
because of those lot of taekwondo take techniques developed because they don't

1348
01:17:39.621 --> 01:17:41.870
allow leg kicks.
Cause if they allowed leg kicks,

1349
01:17:41.871 --> 01:17:43.610
a lot of the shit you do wouldn't work.

1350
01:17:43.940 --> 01:17:46.880
It was one of the first things that I learned when I started kickboxing was that

1351
01:17:47.090 --> 01:17:49.490
there's two things that I suck at.

1352
01:17:49.700 --> 01:17:52.580
I suck at getting kicked in the legs and I suck at boxing.
Right?

1353
01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:55.640
Like when I was outside kicking distance,
I was good.

1354
01:17:55.910 --> 01:17:59.360
But when guys get close to me,
I would be flustered.
I didn't know what to do.

1355
01:17:59.361 --> 01:18:02.660
I got punched in the face a lot.
I got my leg kicked.
I was like,
Ooh.

1356
01:18:02.790 --> 01:18:04.610
Well that was,
that's what's so different about Conor Mcgregor,

1357
01:18:04.611 --> 01:18:06.290
which I didn't realize he was a national champion.

1358
01:18:06.291 --> 01:18:08.720
There was a national amateur champion as a boxer,

1359
01:18:09.110 --> 01:18:11.610
which I didn't know and they never really talk about it.
And UFC,

1360
01:18:11.630 --> 01:18:15.470
you never see that really in his credits.
But he was,
he won the nationals.
Well,

1361
01:18:15.471 --> 01:18:19.640
it's his,
he's kicking.
That's almost more impressive what I'm saying,

1362
01:18:19.641 --> 01:18:22.490
that he's one of the few guys who can kick and then when he's in there,

1363
01:18:22.491 --> 01:18:25.670
his hands are amazing.
Like he doesn't have that problem.
He's a good,

1364
01:18:25.671 --> 01:18:28.790
he's an excellent boxer,
is an excellent boxer,

1365
01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:32.180
which was shocking to me is how well he's picked up the kicking.

1366
01:18:32.810 --> 01:18:35.820
He's like throwing a hook kicks and spinning back kick,

1367
01:18:35.850 --> 01:18:38.540
like that's his opening moves.
I really think,

1368
01:18:38.900 --> 01:18:43.900
I really think a lot of it is like he truly is after in a such a single mine in

1369
01:18:44.721 --> 01:18:47.630
way such a single in my way the championship,

1370
01:18:47.660 --> 01:18:52.250
that's all that matters and it's the next level,
next level,
next level guys.

1371
01:18:52.430 --> 01:18:55.400
There's like,
okay,
here's the new evolution.
The next level guys,

1372
01:18:55.401 --> 01:18:59.420
a guy who was a wicked boxer who's got an iron chin who fucking totally believes

1373
01:18:59.421 --> 01:19:03.470
in himself has charisma coming out of every fucking porn.
His body.
Oh,

1374
01:19:03.620 --> 01:19:07.490
and he can knock you the fuck out with any hand and he calls it.

1375
01:19:07.491 --> 01:19:10.790
He predicts it like Ali's predicted he's going to knock out the number five guy

1376
01:19:10.791 --> 01:19:14.360
in the world with within the first round trying to get it dressed to the nines.

1377
01:19:14.390 --> 01:19:18.920
Yeah,
he's hilarious.
He's awesome.
Fucking love the guy and a guy like that,

1378
01:19:18.921 --> 01:19:20.810
man,
that's next level shit.

1379
01:19:20.900 --> 01:19:25.130
That's like everything that Jon Jones has failed to do with the public.

1380
01:19:25.190 --> 01:19:27.510
This fucking guy has done without even winning the championship.

1381
01:19:27.530 --> 01:19:30.470
Kratovil it's fascinating because like a lot of people,

1382
01:19:30.471 --> 01:19:34.550
like I've always tried to figure out what it is about someone that makes people

1383
01:19:34.551 --> 01:19:38.180
like them.
It's so hard to tell man,
you don't know what the fuck it is.

1384
01:19:38.420 --> 01:19:42.710
Like I never saw a guy like McGregor coming.
I never saw that.
I always felt like,

1385
01:19:42.711 --> 01:19:46.250
you know,
I've seen it rise up to the hype.
Right?

1386
01:19:46.251 --> 01:19:49.850
So it's one thing to talk a big game.
It's another,

1387
01:19:49.851 --> 01:19:52.310
when you are actually championship material,

1388
01:19:52.311 --> 01:19:56.240
when your skill level and you're doing what you said you do,
when you,

1389
01:19:56.300 --> 01:20:01.130
when you predict the first round knock out with a guy like Justin [inaudible],

1390
01:20:01.670 --> 01:20:05.630
Dustin,
I mean dust to Christ.
Now I'm terrible.
A fighter pot.
I know,

1391
01:20:05.631 --> 01:20:10.590
I know Dustin play,
I keep saying Justin,
but I mean,
that guy's a killer,
you know?

1392
01:20:10.591 --> 01:20:13.850
And he did it.
He's a bad motherfucker.
Yeah.
He just got caught up in the,

1393
01:20:13.910 --> 01:20:18.840
in the headlights.
You know,
Mcgregor is no joke.
He's really good.
And again,

1394
01:20:18.841 --> 01:20:21.180
he's next level who you are at that way.
And what was he saying to them?

1395
01:20:21.270 --> 01:20:25.620
It wasn't the way I was in Toronto.
Yeah.
Um,
he's uh,
it's a,

1396
01:20:25.621 --> 01:20:27.810
it's a fascinating time for martial arts man.

1397
01:20:28.170 --> 01:20:31.650
Really interesting time because all of these techniques that were thought to be

1398
01:20:32.100 --> 01:20:35.690
not like pivotal techniques have become pivotal techniques like front kicks to

1399
01:20:35.691 --> 01:20:38.580
the face.
That's not even a flashy technique.

1400
01:20:38.581 --> 01:20:41.790
But once Anderson Linden and on veto or all of a sudden it became like a number

1401
01:20:41.791 --> 01:20:46.530
one technique and then uh,
Brown landed on the Alster,

1402
01:20:47.070 --> 01:20:49.740
he landed it in that fucking,
oh my God,

1403
01:20:49.741 --> 01:20:53.040
it's v tour or not a veto veto or getting knocked out by Anderson.

1404
01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:57.360
But Randy getting knocked out by Machida jumping front kick,

1405
01:20:57.840 --> 01:20:59.640
but she took it to the next level.

1406
01:21:00.180 --> 01:21:04.710
I want to thank that Mississippi has a golf does me in front kick so crazy that

1407
01:21:04.711 --> 01:21:06.400
these techniques like that.
No.

1408
01:21:06.410 --> 01:21:10.320
And now Thompson does like a lot of like front leg round kicks.

1409
01:21:10.321 --> 01:21:11.460
He does a lot of weird shit.

1410
01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:15.920
He sneaks kicks over behind your shoulder and then chop.
No,
Wonderboy,

1411
01:21:15.990 --> 01:21:18.780
Taiwan's Stephen Thompson.
He's doing a lot of like weird,

1412
01:21:18.781 --> 01:21:22.470
interesting karate kicks.
Yeah.
Josh Thompson's got some serious kicks too.

1413
01:21:22.471 --> 01:21:26.160
He's like the first guy to stop Nate Diaz in the octagon.
He had kicked him.
Yeah,

1414
01:21:26.310 --> 01:21:29.460
that was fucking nasty.
So it was a dish.

1415
01:21:29.461 --> 01:21:33.930
It's funny he has really coming back to fight Anderson Silva.
Yeah.
When is that?

1416
01:21:33.931 --> 01:21:38.080
January.
You want to be there?
Come on.
I've got a show.
Do the show.
Uh,

1417
01:21:38.250 --> 01:21:42.620
and um,
the Mirage,
um,
at the Mirage.
What,

1418
01:21:42.621 --> 01:21:45.600
what day in January,
whatever.
It's like whatever.

1419
01:21:45.601 --> 01:21:50.400
January 2nd or January 1st probably.
I'll figure out a new year.
Show anywhere.

1420
01:21:50.680 --> 01:21:53.990
Yeah.
Where yet?
I'll be in Bora Bora with my family.
Why?

1421
01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:58.450
It's so you're never going to make a show in Vegas.
It's new years.
Oh Shit.

1422
01:21:58.760 --> 01:22:00.540
What are you retarded?
What are we talking about here?

1423
01:22:01.170 --> 01:22:03.450
I kept thinking it was after that.
This is Brian,
by the way.

1424
01:22:03.451 --> 01:22:06.340
He'll tell you I'll be at your party.
Maybe I'll tell you,
hey,

1425
01:22:06.341 --> 01:22:09.210
I'm going to be in Russia for a month.
What are you going to come to my point?

1426
01:22:09.211 --> 01:22:13.070
You RSVP you dick.
You don't know.

1427
01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:18.030
Well,
that's why you're funny.
I'm in Bora Bora.
Speaking of which,
I'll be in that.

1428
01:22:18.090 --> 01:22:19.500
I liked her responsible people.

1429
01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:24.210
I'll be at the Atlanta Improv October 17th just plug it like that.

1430
01:22:24.211 --> 01:22:26.760
That's weird.
You were talking about where you'd be.
No,
no,
no,

1431
01:22:26.761 --> 01:22:29.570
I didn't talk about that.
I just happened to have,
she's like,
wait,
okay,

1432
01:22:30.310 --> 01:22:32.280
we're talking about fights.
You want to be there for the foot.
Do you want me,

1433
01:22:32.300 --> 01:22:34.860
when do you want me to,
not October 16th 17th and 18th right.

1434
01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:37.740
Tickets aren't sale for my thing yet.
No,
no.

1435
01:22:37.860 --> 01:22:40.470
I'll cause I'll be in pudding and then trying to bring in,
yeah,

1436
01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:44.760
probably that's where you have for what New Year's?
No,
I'm with my family.

1437
01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:47.520
I was talking about October.
What are you going to Bora Bora.

1438
01:22:47.521 --> 01:22:51.870
What the fuck is dad's taken?
Everybody.
Christ,
family,
kids and everything

1439
01:22:53.470 --> 01:22:57.690
tall.
I was like,
really?
All right.
I never been.

1440
01:22:57.720 --> 01:22:58.770
I get nervous on vacation.

1441
01:22:58.771 --> 01:23:02.490
I just not good really taking it to get nervous and I just,
I just get restless.

1442
01:23:02.491 --> 01:23:04.530
I can't hang to here's,
here's the reality.

1443
01:23:05.410 --> 01:23:07.930
Our life is way more fun than average.

1444
01:23:08.410 --> 01:23:13.240
He get to be a goddamn comedian all the time and like it's a Friday night and

1445
01:23:13.241 --> 01:23:15.640
there's no show.
You look at your watch and go,
shit,

1446
01:23:15.641 --> 01:23:19.060
I could be on stage right now.
It's like crystal.
Yeah.
Crystal.
Leah was like,

1447
01:23:19.150 --> 01:23:21.700
if I'm not,
why would I do anything?

1448
01:23:21.730 --> 01:23:25.810
Why would I talk to you dude when all I do is crush?

1449
01:23:26.710 --> 01:23:31.210
And
he was like,
you know what,

1450
01:23:31.220 --> 01:23:35.530
I crush and calm.
That's hilarious.
Yeah.

1451
01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:40.930
How about Chris living in a good old pocket there?
I was loving it.
Just,
just his,

1452
01:23:40.960 --> 01:23:45.520
his Instagram cracks me up and he's just fucking love and stand up and just sell

1453
01:23:45.521 --> 01:23:47.560
it out.
Selling out all over the place.

1454
01:23:47.740 --> 01:23:51.580
It's nice to be in a place where everything starts clicking.

1455
01:23:52.150 --> 01:23:56.710
I see guys like him.
Everything is clicking.
It's all firing together.

1456
01:23:57.670 --> 01:23:59.290
It's cool to watch.
Yeah,
man.

1457
01:23:59.650 --> 01:24:02.650
I've been watching a lot of standup over then the last,
last few weeks.
Really?

1458
01:24:02.770 --> 01:24:07.060
Yeah.
Watched Katt Williams special and I uh,
I enjoyed it.

1459
01:24:07.380 --> 01:24:10.180
It was on a lot of people.
Some people were criticizing and I enjoyed it.

1460
01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:13.240
One of the things I really enjoyed his,
there's a version of it on youtube,

1461
01:24:13.270 --> 01:24:15.130
if you see the version on youtube,
so many captured,

1462
01:24:15.131 --> 01:24:19.210
like one of his sets before the special was actually tape where it was like he

1463
01:24:19.211 --> 01:24:23.410
was on fire.
He was just like hitting every beat,
getting ready for the special,

1464
01:24:23.440 --> 01:24:26.800
you know,
and it was more loose and relaxed and the actual special itself,

1465
01:24:26.830 --> 01:24:28.180
I really enjoyed it better actually.

1466
01:24:28.181 --> 01:24:31.570
I thought you could see like how funny he really is when he's on,

1467
01:24:32.110 --> 01:24:35.080
I didn't know who he was and I saw him at the comedy store a while back.
Wow.

1468
01:24:35.081 --> 01:24:39.730
I was so blown away.
I Dunno.
Uh,
three,
four years ago.
Oh,

1469
01:24:39.731 --> 01:24:42.280
okay.
And I remember just watching him,

1470
01:24:42.560 --> 01:24:45.280
it was on tripping on Tuesdays or whatever they call it.
And I was just like,

1471
01:24:45.490 --> 01:24:50.080
what the fuck?
And I walked up to him,
I go,
Bro.
And I was incredible.
Ah,

1472
01:24:50.110 --> 01:24:53.770
thanks man.
Thank you.
Know,
it was very funny dude.
He's a powerful man.

1473
01:24:53.950 --> 01:24:57.790
He's proud when he's nailing it,
man.
He's powerful.
20 years of comedy.
Right?

1474
01:24:57.791 --> 01:25:01.870
And Matt,
that's my kind of comedy too.
It's a lot.
I love his kind of comedy.

1475
01:25:02.230 --> 01:25:05.380
It's just so ridiculous that when he had that issue,

1476
01:25:05.381 --> 01:25:07.360
like he had a bunch of arrests and all kinds of shit.

1477
01:25:07.361 --> 01:25:09.850
I was really bummed out because he's like one of my favorite guys to watch.

1478
01:25:09.851 --> 01:25:14.380
I'm like,
please don't spiral.
Don't spiral.
Keep it together,
man.
Yeah,

1479
01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:18.280
well he did.
Well,
you know,
only he knows,
but he did that special.

1480
01:25:18.310 --> 01:25:22.510
That was a big thing he did on Hbo.
Spike Lee directed it.
That was a big thing.

1481
01:25:23.500 --> 01:25:27.400
I think he's the funniest.
He makes me laugh the most.
Kills me when he's on,

1482
01:25:27.470 --> 01:25:30.730
you know,
but Stan hope makes me laugh hard too,
but in a totally different way.

1483
01:25:31.300 --> 01:25:35.770
Stan hope was like pointing shit out.
That is just ridiculous.

1484
01:25:35.771 --> 01:25:40.100
And then driving it through the fucking skull of America or as Kat Williams,

1485
01:25:40.160 --> 01:25:44.920
just being hilarious.
Just being,
I mean he has points,
he does make points,

1486
01:25:44.921 --> 01:25:48.150
but he's just,
he's all about being fucking hilarious.

1487
01:25:48.340 --> 01:25:51.180
Whether it's making fun of himself or making fun of,
you know,

1488
01:25:51.370 --> 01:25:56.050
someone else or everybody.
I just,
this is a great time for comedy,
man.

1489
01:25:56.051 --> 01:25:58.300
It's a great time to be a fan.
Yeah,
it really is.

1490
01:25:58.330 --> 01:25:59.590
It's a great time to be a comedian too,

1491
01:25:59.591 --> 01:26:01.360
cause there's so much stupid shit going on.

1492
01:26:02.140 --> 01:26:06.050
It's like every time you turn around there's some new fucking stupid thing.

1493
01:26:06.110 --> 01:26:08.840
It's just endless till you just do,
there's so many things to talk about.

1494
01:26:08.900 --> 01:26:13.520
If I followed sports boy really of material,
if you had like some,
uh,

1495
01:26:13.610 --> 01:26:16.840
some good NFL wife beating.
Yeah.
Terrible.
Yeah.

1496
01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:18.470
I don't know what the fuck is going on,

1497
01:26:18.830 --> 01:26:21.290
but it seems like every day you're trying,
it's been going on forever.

1498
01:26:21.291 --> 01:26:24.830
I think now it's just being more exposed.
I think that's what it is.
Huge League.

1499
01:26:25.250 --> 01:26:30.080
Huge number of guys.
Yeah.
What is their,
to get three or four dudes in the NFL,

1500
01:26:30.170 --> 01:26:34.040
how many?
I think there's 50 50 guys at Jamie would know how many guys?

1501
01:26:34.340 --> 01:26:38.930
50 guys at team.
What's that?
50 per team?
Yeah,

1502
01:26:38.931 --> 01:26:42.890
so 50 times 32 you're going to have three or four dudes in that ratio who are

1503
01:26:42.891 --> 01:26:47.780
going to step out.
Okay.
I'm not surprised.
There's no doubt about it,
right?
Yeah.

1504
01:26:47.810 --> 01:26:52.310
I mean that's a thousand something was at 1500 1500 dudes.

1505
01:26:52.370 --> 01:26:55.280
If 1500 dudes,
that's a pretty low average.
Actually,

1506
01:26:55.281 --> 01:26:56.660
if you only get a few wife beaters,

1507
01:26:56.840 --> 01:27:00.920
I wonder what would happen if you got 1500 cement workers?

1508
01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:05.940
15 I'd be a little higher.
Yeah,
that right now.
How about 1500 you know,

1509
01:27:06.260 --> 01:27:10.490
whatever.
Fill in the blank.
Yeah.
You know,
that's why when,
when everybody says,

1510
01:27:10.491 --> 01:27:15.170
you know,
all this guy got divorced,
he got fucked over women are cunts.
You,

1511
01:27:15.290 --> 01:27:16.870
that's all you ever hear about it.

1512
01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:20.840
But I love when I hear about people that get amicably separated.
Yeah.

1513
01:27:20.900 --> 01:27:22.610
Nobody hurts it.
He's,

1514
01:27:22.940 --> 01:27:27.230
there was a lady who got arrested who was on the walking dead.
She,
uh,

1515
01:27:27.260 --> 01:27:30.140
she was an actress.
Like she had a small part and the walking dead,

1516
01:27:30.560 --> 01:27:35.560
she sent Reisen like that fucking poison to people under her husband's name.

1517
01:27:37.340 --> 01:27:40.040
Like she tried to say that he was sending it and it was her,

1518
01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:45.110
she's doing like 20 fucking years in jail for that.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1519
01:27:45.590 --> 01:27:49.310
Fucking terrifying it.
We'll take it to a whole nother level.
You kidding me?

1520
01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:50.210
And people,

1521
01:27:50.210 --> 01:27:54.500
I'm going to send poison and get you locked up in jail forever and laugh.

1522
01:27:54.860 --> 01:27:57.620
I'm going to set you up cause you don't want to be with me anymore or you

1523
01:27:57.621 --> 01:28:00.310
cheated on me or what?
You know,
you fucking wrecked my car.

1524
01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:01.700
Whatever the hell he did.
I don't know what he did.

1525
01:28:02.120 --> 01:28:06.580
I know a guy who was dating a girl got in a fight.
She,
um,

1526
01:28:06.980 --> 01:28:10.250
pulled,
he fell asleep,
he took a pill,
fall asleep on the plane.

1527
01:28:10.730 --> 01:28:14.090
She unzipped his pants and pulled out as junk,
let it sit there.

1528
01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:18.500
And he got in real trouble for that.
Well,
I'm like,
how did he ever get out?

1529
01:28:19.240 --> 01:28:23.300
Uh,
he had to go to court.
He had to hire a lawyer and go to court and everything.

1530
01:28:23.301 --> 01:28:27.500
In fact.
And uh,
yeah,
it was a,
it was a major end.

1531
01:28:27.501 --> 01:28:29.120
They were even thinking about having him.

1532
01:28:29.180 --> 01:28:32.000
He was going to maybe even have to register as a sex offender.

1533
01:28:32.001 --> 01:28:36.890
It became a real issue because the nightmare and the story goes on.

1534
01:28:36.891 --> 01:28:41.060
But I won't talk about it and the fuck.
Yeah.
Sounds crazy.
God.

1535
01:28:41.410 --> 01:28:43.880
Well that can happen because you know what,
man,
you don't know.

1536
01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.880
They can't scan your brain and say,
oh,
this guy's in a sex pervert.

1537
01:28:47.030 --> 01:28:50.510
He's just the guy that got caught up in a relationship with a crazy person.

1538
01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:51.940
But you know,
there's so,

1539
01:28:52.250 --> 01:28:57.230
there's so much power and accusing someone of something or it's setting someone

1540
01:28:57.231 --> 01:29:01.070
up.
There's so much power.
If,
if someone can do that,
male or female,

1541
01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:01.950
someone can send

1542
01:29:02.610 --> 01:29:06.680
<v 2>anthrax in your name and get you busted.
Washed it off from the side.
Right.</v>

1543
01:29:06.910 --> 01:29:10.150
<v 1>Ah,
she was,
she's like,</v>

1544
01:29:10.151 --> 01:29:14.590
what kind of a sick fuck caught though in those forensics guy come in and they

1545
01:29:14.591 --> 01:29:16.150
go and they started asking you a question.

1546
01:29:16.540 --> 01:29:19.670
<v 2>Well,
let's go through this.
Well,
they have to do is get your DNA.
They,</v>

1547
01:29:19.750 --> 01:29:23.350
there's so many people,
they leave DNA on envelopes.
They don't even realize it.

1548
01:29:23.351 --> 01:29:27.820
You're sweaty.
Fuck you licked that envelope.
Oh,
you licked it.
Congratulations.

1549
01:29:27.821 --> 01:29:29.140
You're arrested for the rest of your life.

1550
01:29:29.430 --> 01:29:31.860
<v 1>The best people I know.
It's such a good guy.
He got wait a minute.</v>

1551
01:29:31.861 --> 01:29:32.930
Accused besides you,

1552
01:29:34.330 --> 01:29:37.120
besides you in the workplace,

1553
01:29:40.080 --> 01:29:42.690
how you suddenly get hurt.
One of the,

1554
01:29:42.750 --> 01:29:46.200
one of the best people I know got accused of sexual harassment and got suspended

1555
01:29:46.201 --> 01:29:50.220
from his job for a year.
It was a government job.
So he hires a lawyer.

1556
01:29:50.280 --> 01:29:54.060
Did he really sexually harassed?
No,
no.
My short story is crazy.

1557
01:29:54.300 --> 01:29:56.250
The story was he said something,

1558
01:29:56.580 --> 01:30:00.990
he said something in an illusion to her dress that had relevant something else

1559
01:30:00.991 --> 01:30:02.310
and she goes,
I don't feel comfortable and ran out,

1560
01:30:02.311 --> 01:30:06.570
but she has a history of doing this to people.
So he hires a lawyer,
a woman.

1561
01:30:07.140 --> 01:30:08.370
So how you have to hire this woman?

1562
01:30:09.510 --> 01:30:12.150
My Buddy said they went,

1563
01:30:12.330 --> 01:30:15.810
they went and sat at a table and before it even got to any kind of trial or

1564
01:30:15.811 --> 01:30:19.650
anything,
they they,
they usually think about arbitration.
He started,
he said,

1565
01:30:19.651 --> 01:30:23.850
she started asking this woman some questions and you got to realize this woman

1566
01:30:23.851 --> 01:30:27.270
thought she could get away with a lie,
but all of a sudden she got into the ring.

1567
01:30:27.390 --> 01:30:31.500
She got in the ring with somebody who does this for a living with a lawyer who

1568
01:30:31.501 --> 01:30:36.501
does specializes in people who fraudulent claims are fraudulent claims.

1569
01:30:37.050 --> 01:30:39.330
So all of a sudden she started,

1570
01:30:39.331 --> 01:30:42.690
she started asking this woman questions that my friend hadn't even thought of

1571
01:30:42.691 --> 01:30:47.190
and he said,
dude,
it was the crate.
He eviscerated her until she finally said,

1572
01:30:47.191 --> 01:30:49.020
I don't feel comfortable.
I don't want to do this.

1573
01:30:49.230 --> 01:30:52.140
She went to jumbled their hands.
I don't feel good about,
I don't want to do this.

1574
01:30:52.440 --> 01:30:53.100
And she goes,

1575
01:30:53.100 --> 01:30:57.660
so do you want to drop the charges because you were maybe fabricating the

1576
01:30:57.690 --> 01:31:02.520
circumstances?
I don't.
Whatever,
whatever.
But I went away.
We went.

1577
01:31:02.810 --> 01:31:06.090
<v 2>But it's still scary that someone could just do that to decide.</v>

1578
01:31:06.590 --> 01:31:10.070
They decide they hate you.
Fuck yes.
Or they decide they love you.

1579
01:31:10.410 --> 01:31:13.670
You don't want to have anything to do with them.
Oh God.
Play misty for me.

1580
01:31:13.930 --> 01:31:17.360
All right.
Yeah,
and there's a lot of that out there,
man.
People are fucking nuts.

1581
01:31:17.450 --> 01:31:20.600
Male and female,
both sides.
That's why it's gross.

1582
01:31:20.601 --> 01:31:23.690
When anybody ever goes one way or the other.
I'm all for women's rights.

1583
01:31:23.691 --> 01:31:27.890
I'm all for men's rights.
There's some,
some women I don't like at all.

1584
01:31:27.891 --> 01:31:32.600
I'm just off men.
I don't want to be around ever for the rest of my life.

1585
01:31:32.601 --> 01:31:35.890
It doesn't matter what gender they are.
Like I don't give a fuck.
Right.

1586
01:31:35.990 --> 01:31:40.310
Should meant women get extra rights?
No.
Should they get equal rights?
Absolutely.

1587
01:31:40.460 --> 01:31:45.290
Everywhere.
Everyone.
Everyone should be treated evenly by law without a doubt.

1588
01:31:45.590 --> 01:31:50.330
But when you like when you're more geared up towards one side or the other,

1589
01:31:50.360 --> 01:31:54.890
like I can't get behind these men's rights dudes.
I can't.
So strange.
I tell,
look,

1590
01:31:54.891 --> 01:31:57.920
I think there's definitely some fucked up laws when it comes to alimony.

1591
01:31:58.040 --> 01:32:00.040
There's some fucked up laws when it comes to

1592
01:32:00.280 --> 01:32:04.510
<v 0>child,
a child like custody laws and you know,</v>

1593
01:32:04.600 --> 01:32:07.810
some people do like what you were talking about and what I was talking about.

1594
01:32:07.870 --> 01:32:11.920
Some people make fraudulent claims about their children and they'll do it and

1595
01:32:11.921 --> 01:32:14.950
they'll set a guy up just so that they can get total custody.

1596
01:32:14.951 --> 01:32:18.280
They're going to war,
right?
So if they'll lie about a mean,

1597
01:32:18.490 --> 01:32:22.840
someone who had send Reisen is not above lying about what the husband did to the

1598
01:32:22.841 --> 01:32:25.150
children.
You know,
there's a lot of crazy shit that goes on,

1599
01:32:25.270 --> 01:32:28.030
but it's a human issue more than it's a male woman.
Sure.

1600
01:32:28.450 --> 01:32:32.800
There's some fucked up laws for sure.
I was going to say if you took 1500 women,

1601
01:32:32.801 --> 01:32:35.890
I wonder how many actually have lashed out and hit their husbands.

1602
01:32:36.730 --> 01:32:41.580
Even in the ray rice video.
I believe she had.
She hits him by,
but yeah,

1603
01:32:41.581 --> 01:32:42.010
she hit him.

1604
01:32:42.010 --> 01:32:45.100
But when you're supposed to do is hold on to them unless you see the same size.

1605
01:32:45.190 --> 01:32:46.420
Unless you're fighting Ronda Rousey,

1606
01:32:46.660 --> 01:32:50.140
you better throw some fucking bombs or you better be ready to tap out.

1607
01:32:50.710 --> 01:32:54.580
You get it.
I hope she doesn't break your shit off and stuff it up your ass.

1608
01:32:54.610 --> 01:32:59.410
No doubt she will,
but otherwise just grab a hold of him.
Don't hit.

1609
01:32:59.870 --> 01:33:00.550
It's just,

1610
01:33:00.550 --> 01:33:04.540
and if you really are fighting a chick that you're living with a chick who is

1611
01:33:04.541 --> 01:33:08.080
prone to violence and can probably kick your ass,
break up with her.

1612
01:33:08.530 --> 01:33:10.900
She's too scary.
It's too scary.

1613
01:33:10.930 --> 01:33:15.310
I dated a girl who used to get very physically abusive.
Ooh,
that's scary.

1614
01:33:15.440 --> 01:33:17.860
Called her dumb once she was drunk.
I didn't know she was drunk.

1615
01:33:17.861 --> 01:33:20.980
One of the drunks where you don't know they're drunk and she like,

1616
01:33:20.981 --> 01:33:24.340
they just act normal and it just kind of calling.
I called her dumb,

1617
01:33:24.370 --> 01:33:28.240
a wildcard dumb,
can't remember,
but it was just one of many things.
I called her.

1618
01:33:29.010 --> 01:33:33.580
She swung a boot at me so hard at so hard.
She was so strong.
I ducked,

1619
01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.820
I ducked in it and I had one of those sliding closet and it just,

1620
01:33:37.030 --> 01:33:39.860
just went right through that cloud sliding glass.
Just good goose.

1621
01:33:39.861 --> 01:33:44.680
Just a hole in it.
Whoa.
I was like,
what is going on here man?
I mean it was nuts.

1622
01:33:44.740 --> 01:33:48.430
It was fuck her after that.
Sure it did.
Yeah.
I,
he held her down and I said,
hey,

1623
01:33:48.431 --> 01:33:50.850
calm down,
calm down.
And then we fucked.

1624
01:33:51.370 --> 01:33:55.690
Well that's the best part of that kind of relationship that that was fun for a

1625
01:33:55.690 --> 01:34:00.550
year until I had to figure out a way to meet victor.
Yeah.
Okay,

1626
01:34:00.551 --> 01:34:03.700
let's not talk her.
I know who that is.
Um,
you know,

1627
01:34:03.701 --> 01:34:07.000
the violent part in the making up part of a lot of times that's like what they

1628
01:34:07.001 --> 01:34:11.980
grew up with,
right?
Yeah.
Um,
yeah.
Or they run out of,

1629
01:34:12.040 --> 01:34:17.040
I think a lot of times violence is an offshoot of running out of other

1630
01:34:17.230 --> 01:34:20.530
ammunition.
So you're not,
you can't think of something witty to say.

1631
01:34:20.830 --> 01:34:23.980
You can't really think of a comeback.
You don't even know what to do.

1632
01:34:23.981 --> 01:34:28.030
I think a lot of times it's almost like,
um,
uh,
you regress immediately.

1633
01:34:28.031 --> 01:34:29.980
You just strike,
you just strike because children,

1634
01:34:30.130 --> 01:34:32.200
when they don't have the language,
they'll hit.

1635
01:34:32.860 --> 01:34:37.860
I dated a girl when I was in high school and we broke up and she was dating this

1636
01:34:38.741 --> 01:34:40.840
dude and uh,
she used to,

1637
01:34:40.841 --> 01:34:43.480
we used to work at the same place and when I went to visit her once,

1638
01:34:44.770 --> 01:34:47.020
I was talking to her and she was telling me she was crying.

1639
01:34:47.230 --> 01:34:50.470
Tell me about this guy that she's dating that beats her.

1640
01:34:50.650 --> 01:34:54.220
He hits her and I was like,
oh my God.
Like I couldn't believe it.

1641
01:34:54.610 --> 01:34:59.100
And then she goes,
you know,
what's really fucked up?
Like it.

1642
01:35:00.260 --> 01:35:03.950
I couldn't finish that sentence for you.
I go,
you like it?
Yeah.
And she goes,
yeah,

1643
01:35:03.951 --> 01:35:07.130
I like it.
I don't know why I like it when he hits me.
I go,

1644
01:35:07.131 --> 01:35:11.090
you like it when he hits you?
Yeah.
I go like,
do you want him to keep hitting you?

1645
01:35:11.091 --> 01:35:15.790
She's like,
no,
I'm just fucked up.
And I go,
whoa.
I go,

1646
01:35:15.910 --> 01:35:17.690
you mean he like he broke her window.

1647
01:35:17.691 --> 01:35:20.240
He punched through her window because she's important enough.

1648
01:35:20.241 --> 01:35:23.960
She's important enough to elicit and insane response.

1649
01:35:23.990 --> 01:35:25.970
So she feels valued.
Well,
I was,

1650
01:35:26.090 --> 01:35:29.150
it was fascinating to me because we were both really young at the time.

1651
01:35:29.450 --> 01:35:32.060
I think I was probably,
shit,

1652
01:35:32.061 --> 01:35:36.020
I couldn't have been more than like 17 or 18 and she was probably like the same.

1653
01:35:36.020 --> 01:35:38.120
She was like 17 I was 18 I think.
Something like that.

1654
01:35:38.330 --> 01:35:40.400
So when she was telling me this,
I was like,
what?

1655
01:35:40.910 --> 01:35:44.780
Like you liked it when this guy hits you?
It's strange.
I cook.
Might've been 19,

1656
01:35:44.781 --> 01:35:47.270
18 [inaudible] neighborhood.
You know,
we're just at a high,

1657
01:35:47.271 --> 01:35:51.230
I just had a high school,
you know,
she had graduated so she had to be 18,

1658
01:35:51.500 --> 01:35:55.100
so it was,
um,
it was just bizarre conversation.
I was like,

1659
01:35:55.550 --> 01:35:58.850
you can't let people hit you.
Look at how many people wore red rice,

1660
01:35:58.860 --> 01:36:03.860
how many women were Ray Rice's Jersey and number at the next game because they

1661
01:36:04.341 --> 01:36:07.700
want that violent dick.
I Dunno,
but they were all in solidarity.

1662
01:36:07.730 --> 01:36:10.610
I thought that was amazing.
Yeah.
This,
there's a weird thing.

1663
01:36:11.330 --> 01:36:14.990
It's weird thing when people just decide to fucking jump on board with the

1664
01:36:14.991 --> 01:36:16.430
assholes and wife.
His wife,

1665
01:36:16.431 --> 01:36:21.050
his wife came out and was very public about defending him.
Yeah.
Well,
hey,
um,

1666
01:36:21.080 --> 01:36:23.750
if she complicated,
half are fucking brain knocked in.

1667
01:36:23.751 --> 01:36:26.000
Who knows where her judgements at?
Dude,

1668
01:36:26.001 --> 01:36:28.640
she got Kod and bounced her head off the pole.

1669
01:36:28.760 --> 01:36:33.760
She could have easily Baghdad easily been Daniel easily been dead.

1670
01:36:34.040 --> 01:36:38.060
The idea that he hit her like that and being me,
I don't know.

1671
01:36:38.061 --> 01:36:42.290
Most of the way he dragged her out and didn't really tend to her call it kind
of,

1672
01:36:42.350 --> 01:36:44.150
that was what was,
I thought it was so impersonal.
It's strange.

1673
01:36:44.151 --> 01:36:46.400
Like he just like if he had,

1674
01:36:46.610 --> 01:36:49.190
if he had knocked her out and grabbed her and be like,
oh my God,
Oh my God.

1675
01:36:49.220 --> 01:36:53.060
Oh my God.
Like I just,
I,
I reacted or whatever.
Yeah.
Okay.
I'm a violent guy.

1676
01:36:53.061 --> 01:36:55.170
I played football but to,

1677
01:36:55.190 --> 01:36:59.630
to kind of almost look at her and kind of move her with his foot and it was just

1678
01:36:59.631 --> 01:37:03.650
like,
whoa.
Wow.
You,
you are,
that's,
that's bad news.
Fucked up.

1679
01:37:03.740 --> 01:37:07.730
That's the most fucked up.
Well,
no,
the most fucked up is the impact.
The Punch.

1680
01:37:07.940 --> 01:37:11.180
That's the second most fucked up thing is how he treated her like,
bitch,

1681
01:37:11.630 --> 01:37:13.850
get the fuck up.
You know,
just try.

1682
01:37:13.900 --> 01:37:17.750
It wasn't until someone showed up and people kind of freaking out that it
became,

1683
01:37:17.830 --> 01:37:20.780
you know,
something that,
by the way,
that it too,
there are cameras in elevators.

1684
01:37:20.781 --> 01:37:23.420
I don't know if you know that in 2000 and nobody was thinking that man.

1685
01:37:23.421 --> 01:37:26.990
All he was thinking was she's,
she ain't hitting me.
You know,

1686
01:37:27.060 --> 01:37:28.420
he's going to hit her back.
There's,

1687
01:37:29.240 --> 01:37:32.990
I was on a plane once with Michael Irvin and Michael Irvin.
We were,

1688
01:37:32.991 --> 01:37:34.070
it's a long ass flight.

1689
01:37:34.130 --> 01:37:36.860
We're going to Australia just randomly happen to be on the plane with me.

1690
01:37:37.240 --> 01:37:39.080
And he's a good dude.
He's always at the UFC.

1691
01:37:39.590 --> 01:37:42.020
He's a great guy and a great athlete.

1692
01:37:42.140 --> 01:37:45.050
And we're talking and he was talking about this foundation that he has.

1693
01:37:45.230 --> 01:37:48.290
We works with,
uh,
a lot of,
uh,
young kids,

1694
01:37:48.530 --> 01:37:51.920
teaches them how to harness their anger.
And what he explained,

1695
01:37:52.160 --> 01:37:56.040
he was explaining this to me on the flight that when grow up in

1696
01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:57.870
<v 2>bad neighborhoods with there,</v>

1697
01:37:57.890 --> 01:38:01.050
there's violence in the house and then the mothers under stress all the time.

1698
01:38:01.320 --> 01:38:06.320
It changes like the reaction that the boy has to violence when he gets outside,

1699
01:38:06.930 --> 01:38:11.580
it changes his reaction to stress.
It makes him like ultra impulsive,

1700
01:38:11.610 --> 01:38:14.790
makes them like an inclined towards violence.

1701
01:38:15.330 --> 01:38:19.260
And he was talking about how you literally have to figure out how to rewire your

1702
01:38:19.261 --> 01:38:20.280
brain.
You know,

1703
01:38:20.281 --> 01:38:23.340
and he was talking for personal experience and he was talking about how you have

1704
01:38:23.341 --> 01:38:26.850
to figure out how to rewire your brain in a positive way,
you know?

1705
01:38:26.851 --> 01:38:30.060
And that it's very important to recognize that these kids are coming out of the

1706
01:38:30.061 --> 01:38:34.560
gate with the,
the amount of control that you expect out of a reasonable adult.

1707
01:38:34.770 --> 01:38:36.930
They don't have that amount.
They have less.

1708
01:38:37.230 --> 01:38:40.380
And one of the reasons why they have less as the shit they were exposed to when

1709
01:38:40.381 --> 01:38:44.070
they were in the fucking Wu man.
I mean,
it's like it's beyond them.
Yeah.
You know,

1710
01:38:44.071 --> 01:38:46.920
and I think that's the case with a lot of people.

1711
01:38:46.921 --> 01:38:50.130
I've wondered if that's the case with myself and I don't think I was exposed to

1712
01:38:50.131 --> 01:38:51.930
too much stress in the womb,

1713
01:38:52.350 --> 01:38:54.810
but I was exposed to a lot of violence when I was young.

1714
01:38:55.640 --> 01:38:57.090
I remember a lot of luck,

1715
01:38:57.180 --> 01:39:02.180
fucking crazy shit in my house and my dad's house after my mom moved out because

1716
01:39:02.641 --> 01:39:05.090
my dad used to beat my mom.
I remember.
I remember

1717
01:39:05.720 --> 01:39:10.400
<v 1>crazy stuff.
That's dude,
you don't get over that.
I mean that's the shapes you,</v>

1718
01:39:10.700 --> 01:39:11.533
I mean,
I remember,

1719
01:39:11.900 --> 01:39:16.460
I remember how you were when you were younger because the world was a dangerous

1720
01:39:16.461 --> 01:39:20.600
place,
man.
You kept things at an arm's length.
You are always ready to go.
Always.

1721
01:39:20.720 --> 01:39:23.360
Like you just were always like,
who's that guy?
I don't know that guy.

1722
01:39:23.480 --> 01:39:26.210
You gotta be careful.
Okay.
Why is that guy talking to us right now?

1723
01:39:26.480 --> 01:39:29.210
I remember you were always paranoid that with controlling of the environment,

1724
01:39:29.211 --> 01:39:32.210
you know,
and then you started to calm down.
I think we'd helped a lot.

1725
01:39:32.211 --> 01:39:34.160
That helped a lot.
You know?
And you've got to hold her,
but I'm,

1726
01:39:34.161 --> 01:39:37.070
when you were younger you were not,
you trusted me.

1727
01:39:37.460 --> 01:39:39.710
And maybe one or two other people was also,

1728
01:39:39.711 --> 01:39:42.830
it was coming straight off of competitive fighting.

1729
01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:47.130
She like most of my formative years,
like from 15 to 21 so I go into Columbus.

1730
01:39:47.160 --> 01:39:49.880
What happened when you were in it happened that shit.
All that shit.

1731
01:39:50.240 --> 01:39:52.940
She'll say when you have,
when you have a dad like you did.
I'm sorry man.

1732
01:39:52.970 --> 01:39:56.840
That's not how kids aren't supposed to see that or they are,

1733
01:39:57.680 --> 01:40:00.180
yeah.
Well,
you know,

1734
01:40:02.310 --> 01:40:03.143
we took a long time.

1735
01:40:03.180 --> 01:40:05.390
We spent all their time trying to shelter and protect our children.

1736
01:40:05.450 --> 01:40:08.990
I wonder if that's the best thing sometimes too.
I'm a dude out of the gate.

1737
01:40:08.991 --> 01:40:11.220
I trusted nobody can.
I remember

1738
01:40:11.280 --> 01:40:14.520
<v 2>being five years old and uh,
thinking people who are retarded.</v>

1739
01:40:14.700 --> 01:40:17.730
I remember clearly like seeing people argue over shit when I was like five years

1740
01:40:17.731 --> 01:40:19.620
old.
Go on these fucking dummies.
Jeez.

1741
01:40:19.790 --> 01:40:23.950
<v 1>Climber being in Lebanon during the war.
And how old are you?</v>

1742
01:40:24.070 --> 01:40:27.130
I was a,
I'll tell I'll,
do you want him even better?

1743
01:40:27.430 --> 01:40:31.690
I was fifth,
sixth,
fourth,

1744
01:40:31.691 --> 01:40:36.160
fifth and sixth grade I think.
Or even younger.
So is that 10?

1745
01:40:36.370 --> 01:40:41.260
I was,
uh,
probably from the age of Eight,
nine,
10 in the war.

1746
01:40:41.740 --> 01:40:45.670
Uh,
and and seeing a hearing machine,
guns having to sleep on the floor,

1747
01:40:45.671 --> 01:40:49.120
having to sleep in the basement,
seeing planes bomb,
you know,

1748
01:40:49.121 --> 01:40:51.820
shooting missiles and Bama gas station when you're like,
Hey dad,

1749
01:40:52.060 --> 01:40:54.090
<v 2>how many more years?
This shit,
we've got to deal</v>

1750
01:40:54.090 --> 01:40:56.740
<v 1>with my bag and put fuck back then.
At one point my dad couldn't get back in.</v>

1751
01:40:56.741 --> 01:40:59.710
We had to be evacuated to Greece,
but that feeling that,

1752
01:40:59.940 --> 01:41:04.890
that feeling of helplessness as a boy,
machine guns,
men in uniforms,
just me,

1753
01:41:04.910 --> 01:41:08.530
my mom and my sister,
that kind of stuff.
That stuff makes you feel,

1754
01:41:08.531 --> 01:41:09.790
you never forget that stuff.

1755
01:41:09.791 --> 01:41:13.840
Don't you think that that also sort of imparted that nomadic thing that you have

1756
01:41:13.841 --> 01:41:17.140
going on where you could like live anywhere?
Fuck.
Pull up right now.

1757
01:41:17.370 --> 01:41:21.310
Like Brian is one of the only dudes that I know where I could say,
hey man,

1758
01:41:21.790 --> 01:41:25.030
I got a place in New Mexico.
You want to move there with me?
Yeah.
Okay.

1759
01:41:25.150 --> 01:41:27.650
If you didn't have a family,
no problem healing,

1760
01:41:27.940 --> 01:41:31.870
you would pull up your shit and go anywhere.
You don't.
You make it flash at all.

1761
01:41:32.370 --> 01:41:35.980
I'd be like,
what do you need to bring my clothes?
Let's go.
Let's get outta here.

1762
01:41:35.981 --> 01:41:38.650
You don't.
I remember when you didn't have a door knob.

1763
01:41:39.490 --> 01:41:41.710
He didn't have a fucking door knob.
You know,
some people say,

1764
01:41:41.711 --> 01:41:44.950
oh you God keeps his door open all the time.
He's never,
his door's never locked.

1765
01:41:44.951 --> 01:41:47.760
No,
no,
no.
He didn't have a fucking door.
Nothing.

1766
01:41:47.770 --> 01:41:51.010
You could still go over his house and I would go with Bro.

1767
01:41:51.011 --> 01:41:52.910
You don't have a door knob like are going to open.

1768
01:41:52.990 --> 01:41:55.960
I can get on my knees and I can look through your fucking door hole.

1769
01:41:56.290 --> 01:41:59.440
How about Adventist?
When the woman was cooking breakfast,
cooking.

1770
01:41:59.550 --> 01:42:02.180
Do you got it going on honey?
She's making a meal at my stove.

1771
01:42:02.181 --> 01:42:03.580
The cops where you want to cuss charges?

1772
01:42:03.581 --> 01:42:07.080
I was like no homeless person that's walked in.
I was like [inaudible] place.

1773
01:42:07.390 --> 01:42:10.120
Yeah,
that was the same place.
We didn't have a door knob.
Yep.
Yep.

1774
01:42:10.270 --> 01:42:14.800
He was in Venice.
Venice.
Completely ridiculous.
What are you gonna Steal my TV?

1775
01:42:14.830 --> 01:42:17.620
I don't care.
Yeah,
you would just,
you could always abandoned shit.

1776
01:42:17.640 --> 01:42:19.060
Why did I have are,
but do you,

1777
01:42:19.061 --> 01:42:22.300
do you think that's why like you don't appreciate Nice Shit.

1778
01:42:22.540 --> 01:42:24.570
Like you don't even appreciate it.
Like a nice car.
Like you know,

1779
01:42:24.730 --> 01:42:25.630
you make good money.

1780
01:42:25.800 --> 01:42:28.520
You can get like one of those sweet new Cadillacs or something like that.

1781
01:42:28.521 --> 01:42:32.650
And a Tesla.
I want it.
Ooh,
look,
look,
comfy to drive around.
I just,

1782
01:42:32.740 --> 01:42:34.120
I've always had a sense of guilt,

1783
01:42:34.121 --> 01:42:37.750
partially because I grew up in countries where people had nothing.

1784
01:42:38.080 --> 01:42:42.580
I remember seeing like somebody with leprosy and no foot in,
in Yemen,

1785
01:42:42.970 --> 01:42:46.020
uh,
going through the marketplaces and when you're a white kid and,

1786
01:42:46.021 --> 01:42:49.590
and the math falls in your favor for no fucking reason.
You,

1787
01:42:49.670 --> 01:42:52.540
you don't think that you're God's favorite.
You just as a kid,

1788
01:42:52.541 --> 01:42:57.541
I couldn't navigate or understand why I saw like kids coming up to a starving in

1789
01:42:57.581 --> 01:43:02.050
India and Pakistan asking for food [inaudible] and I had everything.

1790
01:43:02.260 --> 01:43:04.510
That doesn't make sense.
That doesn't make you feel good as a kid.

1791
01:43:04.540 --> 01:43:05.770
Especially not someone like me.

1792
01:43:05.771 --> 01:43:07.990
I had the imagination or whatever it was to kind of go,

1793
01:43:08.440 --> 01:43:11.590
I got lucky because the math fell in my favor.

1794
01:43:11.591 --> 01:43:16.210
I did zero to deserve this and that.
That creates two things.
Guilt and shame,

1795
01:43:16.211 --> 01:43:20.470
I think.
Um,
and I never lost that.
I never lost that.
I still feel that way.

1796
01:43:20.500 --> 01:43:24.570
That's fascinating.
I hate having people come work at my house.
Like,
if,

1797
01:43:24.590 --> 01:43:28.300
if they're doing work in my house and I go out of my way to make sure that they,

1798
01:43:28.330 --> 01:43:32.920
you know,
feel like I'm the same as they are,
I don't like,
I'd be terrible.

1799
01:43:32.921 --> 01:43:36.760
It'd be a terrible king.
I feel.
I find it very uncomfortable.
Uh,

1800
01:43:36.790 --> 01:43:39.200
all that stuff anyway.
Yeah,
no,
I hear Ya.

1801
01:43:39.220 --> 01:43:40.990
That might be why my father laughed at me one time.

1802
01:43:40.991 --> 01:43:44.020
He came to visit me and my father grew up poor and he was laughing.
He goes,

1803
01:43:44.050 --> 01:43:44.980
what's with this car?

1804
01:43:44.981 --> 01:43:49.660
I was driving some terrible forward and it was really dirty.
And he's like,

1805
01:43:49.750 --> 01:43:52.340
you know,
I can afford to buy you a Lexus

1806
01:43:52.340 --> 01:43:56.300
<v 0>if you wanted.
Would you want one of those?
And I was like,
no,</v>

1807
01:43:56.500 --> 01:43:58.040
I never thought of that.
First of all,

1808
01:43:58.041 --> 01:44:00.560
I don't want somebody else getting it for me.
Second of all,
it just didn't,

1809
01:44:00.650 --> 01:44:03.860
it wouldn't make an impact in my life.
And I respect though,

1810
01:44:03.861 --> 01:44:08.780
like Brendan Brennan shop grew up with not a lot of money,
so nice things to him.

1811
01:44:09.110 --> 01:44:13.450
Nice clothes,
nice car.
They mean a lot.
They mean they,
they,

1812
01:44:13.460 --> 01:44:17.300
they remind him that he's not what he used to be.
Yeah,
man.

1813
01:44:17.360 --> 01:44:22.190
So I've always respected the idea of limited materialism.

1814
01:44:22.220 --> 01:44:23.960
I understand where it comes from.

1815
01:44:24.560 --> 01:44:26.810
I also think it depends on what you're turned on by.

1816
01:44:26.811 --> 01:44:28.780
I'm wearing says more interested in that.
You know,

1817
01:44:28.870 --> 01:44:32.960
somebody said this woman wrote this book,
said I had all these experiences.

1818
01:44:32.961 --> 01:44:36.410
She went to study for work with the KGB as an interpreter and then went to the

1819
01:44:36.610 --> 01:44:39.950
Antarctic and then went to India and she said I was doing nothing.

1820
01:44:39.980 --> 01:44:42.350
I had all these experiences but my brain wasn't changing.

1821
01:44:42.410 --> 01:44:46.220
I needed to figure out how to change my mind.
She had failed math in high school,

1822
01:44:46.221 --> 01:44:49.070
but she was looking,
she was in the military and she was watching all these,
uh,

1823
01:44:49.610 --> 01:44:51.980
these engineers solve problems in this beautiful way,

1824
01:44:51.981 --> 01:44:54.620
but it looked like hieroglyphics and she goes,
wait a minute,

1825
01:44:54.621 --> 01:44:58.490
if I can learn how to do this,
then I'll change the way my brain works.

1826
01:44:58.670 --> 01:45:01.340
And she talks about it a lot and she became a professor of engineering.

1827
01:45:01.341 --> 01:45:04.580
But you know that I think I'm more interested maybe,
maybe.

1828
01:45:04.581 --> 01:45:06.590
It depends on what you're more turned it on by.

1829
01:45:06.591 --> 01:45:10.310
I'm really fascinated with changing who I am in a way.

1830
01:45:10.340 --> 01:45:12.900
Maybe the way I put he tried to be,
uh,

1831
01:45:14.210 --> 01:45:19.070
just just continue to be as original and as creative as I can be.
That's all.

1832
01:45:19.100 --> 01:45:22.460
That's my thing.
And you can't have a tussle in that.
I can,

1833
01:45:22.461 --> 01:45:26.930
I want to get a test last.
I think I'm going to,
I'm waiting for my Passat,

1834
01:45:26.960 --> 01:45:31.030
my turbo diesel Passat lease to run out.
This is just devil's advocate.
Yeah.

1835
01:45:31.070 --> 01:45:35.750
But people that make good money and then don't buy nice things.

1836
01:45:36.080 --> 01:45:38.600
What is the fucking point of making good money?

1837
01:45:38.840 --> 01:45:43.790
Someone who is poor who looks at you.
We'd be like,
hey dummy,
you,

1838
01:45:43.820 --> 01:45:46.850
you know,
you're like,
part of,
you know,
we've talked about this yesterday,

1839
01:45:46.851 --> 01:45:51.200
the 1% of the world of the world,
more than $34,000 a year.

1840
01:45:51.710 --> 01:45:54.800
It's just nuts.
That's the world.
I know how lucky I am.

1841
01:45:54.830 --> 01:45:56.990
Do you know how crazy that is?
Yeah.
And I buy nice things.

1842
01:45:56.991 --> 01:45:59.210
I mean I have a nice house and all that and I'm not,
believe me,

1843
01:45:59.211 --> 01:46:03.470
I'm not like some smart sign.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
But what I'm saying is get a Tesla.

1844
01:46:03.560 --> 01:46:04.130
That's what you're saying.

1845
01:46:04.130 --> 01:46:09.130
What I'm saying is people that like make a ton of money and then don't buy nice

1846
01:46:09.201 --> 01:46:12.140
things.
There's one that's one look like,
hey man,
you know,
you,

1847
01:46:12.141 --> 01:46:14.450
you're the guy that has the opportunity to make a bunch of money,

1848
01:46:14.451 --> 01:46:17.150
buy nice things,
but then there's the other point of view.
It's like,
okay,

1849
01:46:17.151 --> 01:46:17.960
well what are,

1850
01:46:17.960 --> 01:46:20.840
you know you'd hear about Warren Buffett lives in a regular neighborhood and

1851
01:46:20.841 --> 01:46:24.170
he's got a fucking $100 billion.
Um,
yeah,

1852
01:46:24.470 --> 01:46:26.690
because you don't form of affectation.
Right.

1853
01:46:26.720 --> 01:46:28.310
If he's going to live in a regular neighborhood,

1854
01:46:28.311 --> 01:46:32.290
how about you give away 8 billion?
Yeah.
You ain't even going to use it.
Yes.

1855
01:46:32.300 --> 01:46:34.190
Just sitting there and you're 90 correct.

1856
01:46:34.191 --> 01:46:38.420
And I'm sure there's a lot of like philanthropic adventures that he invests

1857
01:46:38.421 --> 01:46:40.580
money in.
I'm sure he spends a lot of money on other things,

1858
01:46:40.910 --> 01:46:45.910
but I'm saying like what level do you think you're supposed to give back?

1859
01:46:46.580 --> 01:46:48.920
Like,
what are you supposed to give to charity?

1860
01:46:49.110 --> 01:46:53.490
Are you supposed to be nice to your fellow humans or the other?

1861
01:46:53.610 --> 01:46:55.570
I've been writing about the idea that,
you know,
this,

1862
01:46:55.571 --> 01:46:57.720
this idea that I've not anything bad enough to go to hell,

1863
01:46:57.930 --> 01:46:59.520
but I feel like I have not even good enough to go to.

1864
01:46:59.521 --> 01:47:02.610
I'm definitely not sitting anywhere close to mother Theresa if she's in heaven.

1865
01:47:02.611 --> 01:47:06.090
You know,
I just feel like there's a lot more evident held over your head.

1866
01:47:06.120 --> 01:47:07.080
In other words.
In other words,

1867
01:47:07.081 --> 01:47:09.810
there's a lot more I could be doing to give to charity.
Like kind of literary.

1868
01:47:10.110 --> 01:47:13.890
Yes,
I'm being literary,
I'm being,
I'm being deep,
I'm being spiritual.

1869
01:47:14.130 --> 01:47:16.650
But I do feel like I should be given more in some ways the charity.

1870
01:47:16.651 --> 01:47:17.910
But then I think to myself,

1871
01:47:18.030 --> 01:47:20.010
I'm doing exactly what I was putting on the earth to do,

1872
01:47:20.040 --> 01:47:21.570
which is make people laugh.

1873
01:47:21.750 --> 01:47:23.730
And that takes a lot of work in that stop right there.

1874
01:47:23.760 --> 01:47:27.120
Isn't that just justifying like the uncomfortable nature of that discussion?

1875
01:47:28.850 --> 01:47:32.280
Maybe I'm just fucking awesome and I'm here to be awesome.
And again,

1876
01:47:32.281 --> 01:47:37.060
I snips rather be an awesome cause I spend a lot of money on wine and yeah,

1877
01:47:37.110 --> 01:47:38.820
but that's not what you were saying.
You were saying like,

1878
01:47:39.150 --> 01:47:42.570
I should I feel like should I give more to charity and what does that mean?
Okay.

1879
01:47:42.571 --> 01:47:45.300
First of all,
here's the difference.
Here's the,
here's how you delineate.

1880
01:47:45.780 --> 01:47:49.860
So if I could give to charity and we can,
there's a lot of different definitions.

1881
01:47:50.280 --> 01:47:54.690
Is,
is charity going back to what we were talking about,
his charity,

1882
01:47:55.260 --> 01:47:59.490
what people need or do they need inspiration?
So how do you create inspiration?

1883
01:47:59.491 --> 01:48:03.480
So giving,
giving money to survive or I dunno,

1884
01:48:03.630 --> 01:48:06.870
why is it an or?
I'm just wondering if I could do,

1885
01:48:07.140 --> 01:48:08.780
if I could make a big difference that there's,

1886
01:48:08.820 --> 01:48:12.690
there's a school in Haiti or something I'm sure could use some money.
Right,

1887
01:48:12.950 --> 01:48:17.790
right.
Okay.
All right.
I could give to that school.
Um,

1888
01:48:17.820 --> 01:48:20.730
and I do,
I do have charities I give to give to doctors without borders.

1889
01:48:20.760 --> 01:48:24.420
I give to operation smile.
Uh,
that's at different things.

1890
01:48:24.570 --> 01:48:25.950
I got my own individual thing.
People,

1891
01:48:25.951 --> 01:48:27.740
people who have a hard time when they give charity.

1892
01:48:27.741 --> 01:48:30.210
And they find out how much money goes to administrative costs.

1893
01:48:30.480 --> 01:48:35.160
Fucking drives me crazy fucking,
I think the United way.
What was it?

1894
01:48:35.161 --> 01:48:37.590
What'd they say?
Out of a dollar or a penny actually goes to the charity.

1895
01:48:37.591 --> 01:48:40.770
The rest of his run,
the whole fucking thing.
It's a whole bureaucracy.

1896
01:48:40.771 --> 01:48:44.940
They got to run,
but to business it drives me crazy.
It drives me crazy.

1897
01:48:44.970 --> 01:48:49.060
One penny does go to the starving kids will go fuck yourself because I want my

1898
01:48:49.061 --> 01:48:53.190
number is pull up the number of find out which organization was it?
United way.

1899
01:48:53.280 --> 01:48:57.390
United way.
See how much I'm going to get actually goes,
I believe it's a penny.

1900
01:48:57.780 --> 01:48:58.640
I believe it's a,
it's a,

1901
01:48:58.680 --> 01:49:01.560
it's a hundred I'm going to get crazy and say it's 20 cents.

1902
01:49:01.710 --> 01:49:04.980
20 cents out of a dollar.
Okay.
You think it's really a penny used to be,

1903
01:49:05.200 --> 01:49:09.240
give it a special on and say it's 47 40 cents.
I don't think it's that high.

1904
01:49:09.510 --> 01:49:13.140
I bet it's less than 40 cents to huge company.
Okay.
I say 20 you say one?

1905
01:49:13.320 --> 01:49:18.030
Brian says 40 is it 47.
Oh,
you're saying for you?

1906
01:49:18.070 --> 01:49:21.810
So I'll be like the Internet that we had get at the answers to all these

1907
01:49:21.840 --> 01:49:25.830
instantly when he's Google it though sometimes not so much.
Sometimes not.

1908
01:49:25.831 --> 01:49:28.680
Sometimes shit gets a little confabulated.
There are,

1909
01:49:28.681 --> 01:49:31.320
there are really good charities out there that make a difference.
Well,

1910
01:49:31.321 --> 01:49:35.220
the thing is,
here's the question,
should someone running a charity make a salary?

1911
01:49:35.280 --> 01:49:36.360
Of course they should.
Yes.

1912
01:49:36.420 --> 01:49:41.010
But should they make a salary relative to what people make in America or the

1913
01:49:41.011 --> 01:49:42.870
third world country where they're aiding?

1914
01:49:43.140 --> 01:49:46.980
That's when shit gets weird because if it's the third world country that they're

1915
01:49:46.990 --> 01:49:49.270
eating,
well,
they're going to be bitter as shit.
Yeah.

1916
01:49:49.300 --> 01:49:52.450
They're working their whole life way and they can't even fucking put a roof over

1917
01:49:52.451 --> 01:49:56.230
their head and feed themselves normally.
So it should be like an American salary,

1918
01:49:56.560 --> 01:49:59.350
I would imagine.
But if it's an American salary for a professional,

1919
01:49:59.351 --> 01:50:03.490
like what is that?
Is it a hundred grand's at 50 grand is at 35 grand?

1920
01:50:03.550 --> 01:50:06.610
What's the answer?
Okay.
United way.
Uh,

1921
01:50:07.300 --> 01:50:10.570
well this is United way up to Pika.
So I'm just,

1922
01:50:10.630 --> 01:50:13.720
I'm guessing this is a good example of what United.
Okay.

1923
01:50:13.721 --> 01:50:18.340
I guess different local Bud withholds 20% with holds.

1924
01:50:18.341 --> 01:50:22.030
What do you mean with holds 20% of the,
of what you give of what you give.

1925
01:50:23.290 --> 01:50:23.760
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1926
01:50:23.760 --> 01:50:25.380
<v 0>Um,
can you list so they only take,</v>

1927
01:50:25.920 --> 01:50:29.040
so today when a 22% 22% okay.

1928
01:50:29.310 --> 01:50:34.000
I just googled what percentage where it is United way charity go right here.

1929
01:50:34.060 --> 01:50:34.893
Okay.

1930
01:50:35.210 --> 01:50:40.210
United Way with holds 22% from 2012 designation designations.

1931
01:50:40.430 --> 01:50:43.010
Yeah.
I think they got exposed and they start,
they,

1932
01:50:43.170 --> 01:50:46.170
they made a change because they had,
they ran a special a long time ago about,

1933
01:50:46.560 --> 01:50:47.250
okay,

1934
01:50:47.250 --> 01:50:51.900
here it is worldwide United way claimed combined administrative and fundraising

1935
01:50:51.901 --> 01:50:56.901
expenses in 2011 of 17% meaning that they spend approximately 17 cents for every

1936
01:50:58.381 --> 01:51:00.720
dollar donated on organizational costs,

1937
01:51:00.900 --> 01:51:04.980
but the other 83 cents go directly towards community projects.
That's awesome.

1938
01:51:05.250 --> 01:51:08.550
That's pretty good.
Yeah.
So United way's not a good example.
They used to be,

1939
01:51:08.580 --> 01:51:12.480
there was,
the state did a whole Exposito on them and,
and it was shocking.

1940
01:51:12.660 --> 01:51:15.270
I think they changed w maybe we can't Google that.

1941
01:51:15.300 --> 01:51:19.050
What percentage of money goes to charity?
Let's,
let's just Google that.

1942
01:51:19.080 --> 01:51:22.890
Have money.
Like what's the worst?
Well,
we think the worst,

1943
01:51:24.550 --> 01:51:26.310
but I ain't,
that's really good.
I mean,

1944
01:51:26.340 --> 01:51:30.870
if they can 17% it wasn't like the Jimmy Lewis thing.
A brutal one.
I don't know.

1945
01:51:31.080 --> 01:51:35.190
The muscular dystrophy,
I don't know about that.
Okay.
What percentage of,

1946
01:51:35.191 --> 01:51:38.250
what's Google that,
what is,
what was that telephone called?

1947
01:51:40.030 --> 01:51:41.310
A Jerry Lewis Telethon.

1948
01:51:41.340 --> 01:51:46.320
Jerry Lewis

1949
01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:52.430
charity
telephone.
Okay.
Guess this,

1950
01:51:54.530 --> 01:51:59.360
what do you guess?
What percentage?
Okay.
I would say,
I don't know.

1951
01:51:59.840 --> 01:52:03.950
I would say I would,
high percentage,
I would say 80% goes to the kids.

1952
01:52:04.010 --> 01:52:05.540
America's 50th worth chair.

1953
01:52:05.570 --> 01:52:09.340
Worst charities rake in nearly 1 billion for corporate fundraising.

1954
01:52:10.380 --> 01:52:14.060
There you go.
Wow.

1955
01:52:14.120 --> 01:52:16.400
Was may not necessarily be bad if they,

1956
01:52:16.430 --> 01:52:20.540
if they motivate people to get even more money,
but yeah.
Well look,

1957
01:52:20.750 --> 01:52:24.020
there's a certain amount of money that they would never get right if it wasn't

1958
01:52:24.021 --> 01:52:26.750
for those things.
Like someone was talking about the ice bucket challenge,

1959
01:52:26.870 --> 01:52:28.460
the ice bucket challenge as stupid as fuck,

1960
01:52:28.640 --> 01:52:32.330
but three's the ridiculous amount of money and most people were doing it.

1961
01:52:32.360 --> 01:52:33.193
They're not,

1962
01:52:33.320 --> 01:52:35.720
they're not even donating money and just throwing water on their head.

1963
01:52:36.880 --> 01:52:40.430
But the amount of people that have done,
it's pretty substantial.
Yeah.

1964
01:52:40.580 --> 01:52:44.750
It's millions,
millions of dollars.
Much more than they had last year.
Als Sucks.

1965
01:52:45.170 --> 01:52:48.140
I'm sure.
I'm sure you know,

1966
01:52:48.141 --> 01:52:50.420
they don't even think that Lou Gehrig had Lou Gehrig's disease.

1967
01:52:50.421 --> 01:52:52.830
And that's strange.
Why?
Cause he just got hit in the head.
Yeah,

1968
01:52:52.860 --> 01:52:57.290
I think it's trauma related.
He was k out so many times while playing baseball,

1969
01:52:57.291 --> 01:53:00.150
sliding into people and shit,
playing hard baseball played football,
I believe.

1970
01:53:00.151 --> 01:53:00.210
Yeah.

1971
01:53:00.210 --> 01:53:04.380
<v 6>Look at this.
Joe Did it.
Worst charities ranked by money blown on.</v>

1972
01:53:04.381 --> 01:53:05.910
So this thing costs number one,

1973
01:53:06.090 --> 01:53:11.090
kid's wish network total raised a one point 127 million paid 109 million.

1974
01:53:13.471 --> 01:53:14.850
So 2.5

1975
01:53:15.140 --> 01:53:15.480
<v 0>well no.</v>

1976
01:53:15.480 --> 01:53:19.630
The page of solicitors and houseless spent on direct cache solicitors would,

1977
01:53:19.631 --> 01:53:21.970
that means like advertising,
right?
Is that what that means?

1978
01:53:22.450 --> 01:53:24.280
What is paid to solicitors mean?
Well,

1979
01:53:24.281 --> 01:53:29.281
percentage spent on direct cash aid looks like 2.5% 0.9% 10.8 you used to work

1980
01:53:29.351 --> 01:53:33.370
for a bank.
You can't figure this shit out.
No.
Well,
what does solicitors mean?

1981
01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:37.930
What does solicitors,
what's the difference?
The definition of solicitor.

1982
01:53:38.320 --> 01:53:41.470
I would imagine that people that are paying that are,
that are selling,

1983
01:53:41.530 --> 01:53:46.480
that are somehow going out there and raising the money.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

1984
01:53:46.481 --> 01:53:50.740
So this is paid to the like the spent on getting the money.

1985
01:53:51.070 --> 01:53:55.060
So lawyers,
no people who I'd go out and actually raise the funds.
Well,

1986
01:53:55.061 --> 01:53:58.390
solicitors or legal practitioner,
this is the actual definition.

1987
01:53:59.050 --> 01:54:01.120
Solicitor is a legal practitioner.

1988
01:54:01.121 --> 01:54:04.870
Tourists traditionally deals with any legal matter in court.

1989
01:54:05.140 --> 01:54:06.490
In some jurisdictions.

1990
01:54:06.600 --> 01:54:10.240
The solicitation also mean someone who sells me solicitating prostitute

1991
01:54:11.800 --> 01:54:16.370
listeners or people that are the actual fund raisers though in this context.
But,

1992
01:54:16.660 --> 01:54:19.260
but isn't that someone who was buying?
No,

1993
01:54:19.270 --> 01:54:21.610
it's somebody who who's doing the fund raising to selling.
They're,

1994
01:54:21.611 --> 01:54:23.650
they're essentially going out there.
I believe.

1995
01:54:23.680 --> 01:54:25.360
What happens if you solicit a prostitute though?

1996
01:54:25.570 --> 01:54:28.090
Doesn't that mean you're trying to pay for the prostitutes?

1997
01:54:28.091 --> 01:54:30.460
So that's the solicitor,
right?
So no solicitation,

1998
01:54:30.910 --> 01:54:33.460
no snow trying to sell me anything around here.

1999
01:54:35.390 --> 01:54:38.990
<v 6>The kids,
kids wish network has five employees.
It's getting paid,</v>

2000
01:54:39.020 --> 01:54:42.770
it's paying them,
and then they're only paying 2.5%

2001
01:54:42.790 --> 01:54:47.630
<v 0>to the actual direct cash aid for this.
So only 2.5% of their money,</v>

2002
01:54:47.650 --> 01:54:50.850
right?
Percentage spent on direct cash a day.

2003
01:54:51.220 --> 01:54:52.750
2.5% that's insane.

2004
01:54:52.840 --> 01:54:57.760
What's the other 1.9% for the cancer fund of America?
That's insane.

2005
01:54:58.060 --> 01:55:00.580
Less than 1% children's with found that he,

2006
01:55:00.581 --> 01:55:03.730
these are all like off on the other charities and they're all scams.

2007
01:55:03.760 --> 01:55:07.910
That's so dirty.
American breast cancer foundation,
not associate.
Well,

2008
01:55:07.911 --> 01:55:11.800
I find a charitable foundation.
That one.
Look at that one.

2009
01:55:11.950 --> 01:55:16.180
And you need to police officers' Union of police associates.
Look at that.

2010
01:55:16.450 --> 01:55:21.280
Less than half of a half of a percent.
Yeah,
there,
there,
there.
That's a scam,
man.

2011
01:55:21.400 --> 01:55:24.190
<v 6>Oh wait,
there's one that's 0% look at this operation.</v>

2012
01:55:24.191 --> 01:55:27.490
Look Out National Center for Missing Youth.
0%

2013
01:55:27.590 --> 01:55:30.710
<v 0>wow,
that's insane.
But how's that work?</v>

2014
01:55:30.711 --> 01:55:33.800
It says 19.6 million in 16.0 you know what that is?

2015
01:55:33.801 --> 01:55:37.700
That's like rent and shit operation.
Look at that.

2016
01:55:37.720 --> 01:55:42.600
So the 15 million is paid to out to people.
The rest is bills.
Fuck man.

2017
01:55:42.601 --> 01:55:46.080
I was not to,
we live in a dirty world.

2018
01:55:46.620 --> 01:55:48.540
The world is dirty veterans fund.

2019
01:55:48.600 --> 01:55:51.750
That's so creepy that there's charities that are that far off.

2020
01:55:51.780 --> 01:55:55.200
Less than a percent committee for missing children.

2021
01:55:55.380 --> 01:56:00.360
We thought what did I guess?
I guess 20 you guessed one.
Yeah,
there you go.

2022
01:56:00.450 --> 01:56:03.570
And there's some that are a half of a one.
There you go.
That's why.

2023
01:56:03.571 --> 01:56:06.390
That's why he got to be careful what charities you give to and I think United

2024
01:56:06.391 --> 01:56:07.560
way they did this thing and they were like,

2025
01:56:07.561 --> 01:56:09.840
how much of your money's actually going there?
Back in the day,

2026
01:56:09.841 --> 01:56:10.480
I think it was United.

2027
01:56:10.480 --> 01:56:13.440
How about the charity when they're at the airport and they have the open bucket?

2028
01:56:13.570 --> 01:56:14.970
Oh forget and they want cash.

2029
01:56:14.971 --> 01:56:18.990
I don't know if you are a plastic hole and an open bucket and around the bucket

2030
01:56:18.991 --> 01:56:23.670
is photographs of kids.
And it's like some thing and they have a clipboard.

2031
01:56:23.700 --> 01:56:25.280
I don't know who you are.
Sorry.
Yeah.

2032
01:56:25.380 --> 01:56:28.380
This lady came up to me at the airport once and she was super aggressive about

2033
01:56:28.381 --> 01:56:30.990
it and I said,
get the fuck out of here with that scam.
She goes,

2034
01:56:30.991 --> 01:56:34.560
fuck you mother fucker.
I go,
that's what I was hoping for.
I go,

2035
01:56:34.561 --> 01:56:36.150
that's what I want to hear.
I go,
you're in charge.

2036
01:56:36.180 --> 01:56:39.330
You're involved in a charitable organization,
right.
She's like,
fuck you bitch.

2037
01:56:39.690 --> 01:56:41.490
I go,
you're involved in a charitable organization.

2038
01:56:41.491 --> 01:56:44.160
You're not going to dip into that and take while you're a reputable person.

2039
01:56:44.340 --> 01:56:48.210
Fuck you bitch.
There you go.
She got to hit me.
It was pretty close.

2040
01:56:48.630 --> 01:56:51.270
She has definitely hit me.
It's so great.
I was tired.
I was tired,
man.

2041
01:56:51.271 --> 01:56:54.630
I just landed,
you know,
working and then someone like,

2042
01:56:54.631 --> 01:56:57.720
she was aggressive about it too.
It was like,
she was like,
you know,
sir,

2043
01:56:57.721 --> 01:57:00.360
would you please donate to help you don't Bubba Bubba,
bubba.

2044
01:57:00.500 --> 01:57:03.900
I'm looking at her and I'm like,
I smell danger all over you.

2045
01:57:03.901 --> 01:57:05.400
You don't seem like a charitable person,

2046
01:57:05.910 --> 01:57:09.960
but you could just show up with like a clipboard and a bucket and you know some

2047
01:57:09.961 --> 01:57:12.930
logo on the bucket and you get people to give you cash you to leave you the fuck

2048
01:57:12.931 --> 01:57:13.350
alone.

2049
01:57:13.350 --> 01:57:16.390
Well that actually if you're aggressive cut down on that cause they should hide.

2050
01:57:16.410 --> 01:57:19.230
Christmas used to always come up to you at airports.
Yeah,
but they're Wackos.

2051
01:57:19.260 --> 01:57:20.640
You look at them and you're like,
what's what you're heck?

2052
01:57:20.641 --> 01:57:24.210
I'd tongue poke and the fuck out of here.
I'm not giving you any money.

2053
01:57:24.211 --> 01:57:27.090
You're crazy.
You're not wearing sandals and you're a man.

2054
01:57:27.091 --> 01:57:27.950
Like what are you doing?
You're,

2055
01:57:27.960 --> 01:57:31.680
you're not even like a surfer and a saffron robe thing is a mess.

2056
01:57:31.681 --> 01:57:35.430
You smell weird.
Get Out,
get out.
You smell like curry run.

2057
01:57:35.670 --> 01:57:36.970
Your American would be like,
ew,

2058
01:57:37.160 --> 01:57:40.590
I don't want to be near you and I don't want to give you any money to support

2059
01:57:40.591 --> 01:57:42.960
this thing that you're doing.
And they would sell you a book.
Fuck Outta here.

2060
01:57:42.961 --> 01:57:46.840
What your book's about.
Glad Anita get book.
It depends on,

2061
01:57:47.130 --> 01:57:50.820
I would love to buy the Bhagavad Gita.
Love to,
but not from some dirty hippie.

2062
01:57:51.230 --> 01:57:54.600
I'm going to go to a nice store was a nice person who sells books.

2063
01:57:54.601 --> 01:57:58.320
They could tell me about it.
You know,
there's some beautiful fucking grass.

2064
01:57:58.321 --> 01:58:01.810
You don't see them anymore.
Like Hari Krishna is like the Internet.
Yeah.

2065
01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:05.850
And that smoke them out.
They're like,
what are we doing?

2066
01:58:05.880 --> 01:58:08.970
Everybody thinks we're stupid.
Even Scientologists make fun of them.

2067
01:58:10.980 --> 01:58:14.510
Hari Krishna is the bottom end of the cult pole.
Yeah,
man.
Yeah.

2068
01:58:14.730 --> 01:58:17.190
Everybody goofs on them.
Dunkin could do the whole chant.

2069
01:58:17.370 --> 01:58:19.920
Vegetarians was he of Hari Krishna?
No,
but he just,

2070
01:58:19.921 --> 01:58:24.060
he's really like involved in studying religions and study them his whole life.

2071
01:58:24.061 --> 01:58:29.060
He can do long Buddhist chants,
but Long Hari Krishna Chang.
Yeah.

2072
01:58:29.070 --> 01:58:32.340
He does all that shit.
Yeah.
He can do it like,
and it sounds like,

2073
01:58:32.341 --> 01:58:37.341
like one of those monks and those hollow echoing at monastery so much about Zen

2074
01:58:37.800 --> 01:58:37.801
Buddhism and Buddhism.

2075
01:58:37.801 --> 01:58:42.100
And I've had every book I could get my hands on on Buddhism.
I was just

2076
01:58:42.100 --> 01:58:46.090
<v 2>like,
this is the answer.
You know?
Maybe it is,
but I just somehow got too busy.</v>

2077
01:58:47.020 --> 01:58:50.680
I don't think there's any answer.
Yeah,
because in the end everybody dies.

2078
01:58:51.550 --> 01:58:54.220
That's for dash no answer.
This is what it is.

2079
01:58:54.400 --> 01:58:59.400
How much are you enjoying this and how much are you enjoying being around others

2080
01:58:59.711 --> 01:59:03.550
who are enjoying it and helping each other out and having a good time cause

2081
01:59:03.551 --> 01:59:07.060
other than that,
what,
what else is there?
Is there a deep meaning?

2082
01:59:07.061 --> 01:59:09.490
If everything's temporary,
it doesn't seem like it could be.

2083
01:59:09.910 --> 01:59:13.330
It seems like you're a part of some sort of weird evolutionary process that will

2084
01:59:13.331 --> 01:59:17.830
go on as long as life is allowed to exist on this planet,
which is very finite.

2085
01:59:18.070 --> 01:59:22.480
The planet itself only has like 1.6 billion years of life left.

2086
01:59:22.510 --> 01:59:25.510
Do you think though that you know that if it goes more than that the sun's gonna

2087
01:59:25.540 --> 01:59:28.900
burst sizing son runs out of juice,

2088
01:59:28.990 --> 01:59:31.330
but do you think that there is some,

2089
01:59:31.720 --> 01:59:36.720
there is a either movement toward each other or a movement towards something or

2090
01:59:37.361 --> 01:59:40.940
do you think it's all random and it's hard question,
who the fuck?
No,

2091
01:59:40.960 --> 01:59:45.260
fuck no one knows.
I mean it might.
It might not be.
What about human progress?

2092
01:59:45.261 --> 01:59:49.390
Do you think we've been progressing?
Yes.
Yeah.

2093
01:59:49.510 --> 01:59:51.700
We're tough when there's steps back.

2094
01:59:51.880 --> 01:59:55.090
Like when we talk about like people being PC and all that stuff.

2095
01:59:55.300 --> 01:59:57.760
I think it's terrible,
but it's way better than being racist.

2096
01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:01.720
It's way better than the PC shit is way better than segregated where the blacks

2097
02:00:01.721 --> 02:00:03.070
have to sit in the back of the bus.
He not,

2098
02:00:03.071 --> 02:00:06.430
the keys are different water cooler this way better.
Yeah.

2099
02:00:06.460 --> 02:00:08.470
So that to me is clear example.

2100
02:00:08.471 --> 02:00:12.970
But then there's also drones and spying and crazy shit and people are still

2101
02:00:12.971 --> 02:00:15.910
getting locked up near challenge,
crazy drug laws.

2102
02:00:15.911 --> 02:00:20.420
And then there's private prisons as corporate interests and this fucking,
this,

2103
02:00:20.450 --> 02:00:23.710
this Goldman Sachs thing that came out.
Well,
the,
the,
the,
the,
the,
the,

2104
02:00:23.720 --> 02:00:28.720
the tapes that are now being released of the Fed in coercion with Goldman Sachs.

2105
02:00:28.990 --> 02:00:32.680
I mean all the different shit that's going on.
We,
you see that still,

2106
02:00:32.980 --> 02:00:33.970
it's still corruption.

2107
02:00:34.240 --> 02:00:39.240
There's still evil is still just misdirected energy.

2108
02:00:39.920 --> 02:00:44.920
Incorrect patterns of behavior that have led to people to what to operate in

2109
02:00:45.101 --> 02:00:46.970
this same type of momentum that the,

2110
02:00:46.971 --> 02:00:49.540
the fucking knucklehead traders before them have done.

2111
02:00:49.541 --> 02:00:53.170
And the fucking military industrial complex guys from the 60s did.

2112
02:00:53.171 --> 02:00:54.280
It's all the same kind of,

2113
02:00:54.430 --> 02:00:57.250
that energy's hasn't been flushed out of the system yet,

2114
02:00:57.520 --> 02:01:01.960
but it seems like it's slowly getting pushed into a corner or at least it's hard

2115
02:01:01.961 --> 02:01:05.640
to hide.
She would,
the fuck is going on in Hong Kong.
Yeah,
Dude.
Brian,

2116
02:01:05.680 --> 02:01:09.760
pull up the photos.
There's a drone video of the protest and Hong Kong.

2117
02:01:10.090 --> 02:01:14.650
Holy Shit.
It's an island.
A 7 million that actually want our,

2118
02:01:14.720 --> 02:01:17.440
we want to be able to choose who governs them.
Can you imagine that?

2119
02:01:17.980 --> 02:01:22.400
There's a lot of fucking people I know a lot of PE,
they're also bordered.

2120
02:01:22.400 --> 02:01:27.300
There's also 1.3 billion people on,
on their border and uh,

2121
02:01:27.460 --> 02:01:29.980
they don't feel,
they don't want to be part of China.
The mainland.
Well,

2122
02:01:29.981 --> 02:01:32.170
they used to not be until fairly recently.

2123
02:01:32.200 --> 02:01:34.390
It used to be controlled by the United Kingdom.
Right,
right.

2124
02:01:34.780 --> 02:01:35.980
Look at this fucking video though.

2125
02:01:35.981 --> 02:01:40.250
There's going to freak you out because they're flying over.
They,
by the way,

2126
02:01:40.280 --> 02:01:41.780
it's amazing that they can do that now.

2127
02:01:41.781 --> 02:01:44.690
You could just like a regular person can get a drone.
Crazy.

2128
02:01:46.280 --> 02:01:49.250
When we did that Scifi show,
dude,
I put on these goggles,

2129
02:01:49.490 --> 02:01:54.490
like these VR goggles and they put a camera on this drone and then flew the

2130
02:01:54.501 --> 02:01:59.501
drone over the tree tops and I was like watching from the drones perspective,

2131
02:01:59.571 --> 02:02:00.510
I was like,
oh my,

2132
02:02:00.560 --> 02:02:02.660
we couldn't put it in the episode because we just didn't have enough time.

2133
02:02:03.020 --> 02:02:07.520
But I was like,
I'm flying.
It was amazing of sick.
That's an amazing,

2134
02:02:07.550 --> 02:02:11.570
that's a camera to an eagle.
But I'm telling you at felt like I was flying.

2135
02:02:11.950 --> 02:02:16.340
Like when I had these Vr VR goggles on.
Wow.
I had VR goggles on.

2136
02:02:16.341 --> 02:02:20.810
This thing is flying through trees and stuff and you're,
you're watching like,

2137
02:02:20.811 --> 02:02:24.350
whoa,
how much would that cost to buy?
I want one,
probably a lot.

2138
02:02:24.351 --> 02:02:28.420
And they don't go very far.
Like after a mile,
it doesn't transmit like the wine,

2139
02:02:28.460 --> 02:02:31.760
the signal,
whatever type of signal.
Look at this.

2140
02:02:33.380 --> 02:02:37.580
This is the,
uh,
the crowd.
And this is a them filming this by drone.

2141
02:02:38.090 --> 02:02:41.720
Unbelievable.
Do their tea.
They've shut down the city.
This is incredible.

2142
02:02:41.721 --> 02:02:46.340
Look at that.
Look at that.
Ooh,
that's a million people,
right?
At least,

2143
02:02:46.341 --> 02:02:50.180
I don't know.
I don't know if it walks like,
I think there are 7 million.

2144
02:02:50.181 --> 02:02:54.140
That's like 300 people,
Bro.
Crazy.
That's like a Nick's comedy.

2145
02:02:54.141 --> 02:02:58.420
Stop Pact.
That's second Joe Rogan content.

2146
02:02:58.730 --> 02:03:00.020
Look how many fucking people.

2147
02:03:00.860 --> 02:03:05.860
It's like ants on rice noodle and what year were would they United Kingdom.

2148
02:03:06.770 --> 02:03:08.090
It was until like the night thing

2149
02:03:08.450 --> 02:03:12.470
<v 1>when the lease ran out in um,
gosh,</v>

2150
02:03:12.560 --> 02:03:16.730
19 and nine 2000 2001 1997 what was it?

2151
02:03:17.510 --> 02:03:20.870
I think it was 97 maybe [inaudible] was it later?

2152
02:03:21.920 --> 02:03:25.700
<v 2>They're bracing both sides.
Brace for Wednesday.
Show down.
Oh fuck.</v>

2153
02:03:25.701 --> 02:03:28.100
Are they going to go world war three in Hong Kong too?

2154
02:03:28.840 --> 02:03:32.350
<v 1>I don't think.
Nobody wants that.
They don't want the People's Liberation Army.</v>

2155
02:03:32.400 --> 02:03:33.400
And the,
the,
you know,

2156
02:03:33.401 --> 02:03:36.700
coming into was Liberation Army and the people that call and think,
yeah,

2157
02:03:36.701 --> 02:03:38.830
that's what they Chinese,
I think that's what the Chinese call their army.

2158
02:03:39.130 --> 02:03:40.090
But they don't want the,

2159
02:03:40.270 --> 02:03:44.110
they don't want the Chinese military to come in and get unpleasant,

2160
02:03:44.170 --> 02:03:48.910
that's for damn sure.
So they're asking for the,
the,
the what I believe his name,

2161
02:03:48.970 --> 02:03:50.170
they call him the chairman.

2162
02:03:50.171 --> 02:03:54.550
The person that was put in power by China to step down and they want elections

2163
02:03:54.610 --> 02:03:57.180
to vote in their own.
Um,

2164
02:03:57.670 --> 02:04:02.500
<v 2>in China is saying,
hey,
we're kind of running your country,
um,
you know,</v>

2165
02:04:02.840 --> 02:04:05.730
for considered a country or is it considered considered

2166
02:04:05.860 --> 02:04:10.510
<v 1>province and part of China,
mainland China.
And,</v>

2167
02:04:10.540 --> 02:04:13.120
um,
I think that for the longest time,

2168
02:04:13.210 --> 02:04:17.230
remember that Hong Kong was the sort of the financial capital of that part of

2169
02:04:17.231 --> 02:04:17.980
the world.

2170
02:04:17.980 --> 02:04:21.820
But Shanghai now has taken over and a lot of other cities have taken over as
the,

2171
02:04:22.090 --> 02:04:26.230
they're richer.
Uh,
and,
and so it's a,
it's a complicated thing.

2172
02:04:26.231 --> 02:04:30.670
It's a lot of my mainland Chinese come in and vacation in Hong Kong.
Um,

2173
02:04:31.090 --> 02:04:32.380
so they're pretty dependent on each other.

2174
02:04:32.470 --> 02:04:36.760
<v 2>Look at this photo of his kid shining his fucking flashlights.</v>

2175
02:04:36.790 --> 02:04:38.010
They're all shined the light from

2176
02:04:38.010 --> 02:04:42.350
<v 0>their cell phones.
It's really creepy.
It's on USA Today,</v>

2177
02:04:42.720 --> 02:04:46.520
USA.
Today's coverage.
It's one of the larger photographs.
There's humility,

2178
02:04:47.100 --> 02:04:48.360
there's millions of kids,

2179
02:04:48.361 --> 02:04:53.361
and they all decided to turn their cell phone lights on and they're holding them

2180
02:04:53.641 --> 02:04:58.020
up in solidarity.
And it's kind of symbolic.
Well,

2181
02:04:58.021 --> 02:05:01.340
China also,
apparently the government of China is worried,

2182
02:05:01.730 --> 02:05:04.980
is really worried that if,
if they're,
if they don't,

2183
02:05:06.150 --> 02:05:07.590
if they don't handle this properly,

2184
02:05:07.890 --> 02:05:11.430
there are a lot of cities in China that could do the same thing and asking for

2185
02:05:11.431 --> 02:05:14.460
changes in how the country is governed.
So China's being very,

2186
02:05:14.461 --> 02:05:19.170
very cautious about how they treat this particular approach as they could fuck

2187
02:05:19.171 --> 02:05:23.760
this up.
Everything.
Yes.
Because if,
if it gets too successful,
if it's not,

2188
02:05:24.030 --> 02:05:28.950
there are a lot of things that fucking picture and there's a lot of unrest in

2189
02:05:28.951 --> 02:05:32.880
China.
Not did not just Hong Kong.
Well,

2190
02:05:32.881 --> 02:05:37.680
when did Hong Kong become a part of China?
I think it was during the opium trade,

2191
02:05:37.681 --> 02:05:42.680
wasn't it?
When we sold it,
sold it back to him and 97 and,

2192
02:05:42.730 --> 02:05:46.890
and it,
it was annexed by Shovan was annexed by the British,

2193
02:05:47.100 --> 02:05:50.700
I think a hundred years before that.
So it hasn't even been 20 years.
Right.

2194
02:05:50.940 --> 02:05:54.180
So they're just still trying to work it out.
I mean,
think about 20 years ago,

2195
02:05:54.190 --> 02:05:58.080
wasn't that like Clinton days?
Yeah.
97 those Clinton,
right?

2196
02:05:59.010 --> 02:06:00.630
Yeah.
97 Clinton was president.

2197
02:06:00.631 --> 02:06:04.320
And imagine that like if Clinton like leaves and then also trying to take over

2198
02:06:04.321 --> 02:06:07.800
the U S and we're like,
what?
Yeah,
like that's kind of the same sort of thing.

2199
02:06:07.980 --> 02:06:10.230
If they were under rule of the United Kingdom,

2200
02:06:10.680 --> 02:06:14.580
that's really similar to like the being America or Canada.
Absolutely.

2201
02:06:14.581 --> 02:06:16.800
It is really hard for the,
for,
for,
for,

2202
02:06:16.830 --> 02:06:19.980
and also remember in Hong Kong they speak Cantonese,
they don't speak Mandarin.

2203
02:06:20.310 --> 02:06:24.210
Most of mainland China is mostly a mandarin and they speak a very different

2204
02:06:24.211 --> 02:06:27.510
language.
In Hong Kong they speak mostly Mo,
they do speak mandarin,

2205
02:06:27.511 --> 02:06:30.600
but they also mainly speak Cantonese.
Wow.
Very different form of trans.

2206
02:06:30.660 --> 02:06:35.100
And it was a capitalist system,
a very wealthy area.

2207
02:06:35.490 --> 02:06:39.540
And the big fear was that when the politburo in China took over,

2208
02:06:39.870 --> 02:06:43.770
that they would impose communists,
you know,
market laws and things like that.

2209
02:06:43.771 --> 02:06:48.360
But I think they kind of left them alone for a while and then,

2210
02:06:48.361 --> 02:06:52.710
and now Hong Kong's economy is very tied up with mainland China's economy.

2211
02:06:53.130 --> 02:06:54.240
What a mess.

2212
02:06:55.290 --> 02:06:59.400
It's just weird when you see a situation like that where you know something's

2213
02:06:59.401 --> 02:07:02.160
going to happen and we're watching it from afar,

2214
02:07:02.190 --> 02:07:04.350
from way the fuck over here in California.
And we were like,

2215
02:07:04.470 --> 02:07:06.030
what is going to happen over there?

2216
02:07:06.060 --> 02:07:10.260
Well the question is is trying to going to allow them to behave like a separate

2217
02:07:10.261 --> 02:07:12.010
and independent province cause they,

2218
02:07:12.150 --> 02:07:16.110
they are not according to China and a Chinese law.
That's the issue.

2219
02:07:16.111 --> 02:07:18.240
So then what do you do?
What do you do?
Well.

2220
02:07:18.241 --> 02:07:21.330
Then you got to realize that the people in the military themselves,

2221
02:07:21.840 --> 02:07:23.430
other than the few people that are running it,

2222
02:07:24.090 --> 02:07:26.380
there's going to be a certain point in time where if,

2223
02:07:26.381 --> 02:07:31.200
if there's riots everywhere,
if the entire country goes topsy turvy over this,

2224
02:07:31.290 --> 02:07:34.350
if they all start emulating what's going on in Hong Kong,

2225
02:07:34.530 --> 02:07:37.830
there's a not enough soldiers to cover them all because there's a billion God

2226
02:07:37.831 --> 02:07:42.340
damn people and B,
it would be soldiers turned their guns on their own people.

2227
02:07:42.370 --> 02:07:45.460
Yeah.
These are regular folks just like the soldiers in America.

2228
02:07:45.461 --> 02:07:48.280
I mean it's one of the the weirdest things about people that don't want to

2229
02:07:48.281 --> 02:07:50.560
support the troops.
Like the idea that,
you know,

2230
02:07:50.561 --> 02:07:52.510
I don't support war so I don't want to support the troops.

2231
02:07:52.960 --> 02:07:57.960
Troops are just people and they might be the only thing and their love of

2232
02:07:58.571 --> 02:08:02.680
regular people might be the only thing that protects a really tie radical

2233
02:08:02.681 --> 02:08:07.330
government from turning their guns on the people themselves because they can't

2234
02:08:07.331 --> 02:08:11.350
do that.
If the people holding the guns are fuse somewhere down the chain.

2235
02:08:11.740 --> 02:08:13.420
If we where they say no,

2236
02:08:13.421 --> 02:08:18.421
they say no at general lost the election that Thomas Jefferson,

2237
02:08:18.580 --> 02:08:22.660
because he had a standing army and one of the things that you know,

2238
02:08:22.661 --> 02:08:25.360
the founding fathers warn against was a standing army.
Why?

2239
02:08:25.600 --> 02:08:30.580
Because a standing arbit can be hijacked by a charismatic,
a dictator,

2240
02:08:30.730 --> 02:08:34.780
and then they can,
they can stage a coup.
So that was always,
that was all,

2241
02:08:34.781 --> 02:08:37.150
it didn't sit well for a long time with Americans,

2242
02:08:37.151 --> 02:08:40.690
especially with the way this country was founded on the idea of a standing army

2243
02:08:40.840 --> 02:08:42.850
had always been abused.
Exactly what you're saying.

2244
02:08:42.851 --> 02:08:46.360
And we feel it's okay to go after someone if they have their own army,

2245
02:08:46.690 --> 02:08:50.200
like the Waco Guy.
I like the Waco Guy,
David Koresh.

2246
02:08:50.440 --> 02:08:53.800
He got very little sympathy in this country even though they essentially went in

2247
02:08:53.801 --> 02:08:57.970
and fire bomb these people killed kids,
shot people down.

2248
02:08:57.970 --> 02:09:02.970
There was fucking very clear images of Sherman tanks blowing fire into these

2249
02:09:03.251 --> 02:09:06.490
fucking buildings.
But we knew they had guns.
Yeah.

2250
02:09:06.970 --> 02:09:10.600
That's the only thing we knew.
We knew that we heard the fuck kids.

2251
02:09:10.900 --> 02:09:13.580
That was the thing.
Right.
But by the way,
I was a room.

2252
02:09:13.600 --> 02:09:17.430
That is exactly what I would say if I was going to fucking run some tanks into

2253
02:09:17.440 --> 02:09:19.820
some dude's house,
that guys,
and they're fucking kids.
We've got to,

2254
02:09:19.950 --> 02:09:23.810
we've got to go kill those kids.
And it was ATF anyway.
It was ATF is also,

2255
02:09:23.850 --> 02:09:27.630
you know,
basically about the fact that he had all this sort of a weapon.
Right.

2256
02:09:27.631 --> 02:09:30.130
And Arsenal.
But think about the ultimate irony.

2257
02:09:30.160 --> 02:09:32.140
We're going to save those kids by killing them all.
Yeah.

2258
02:09:32.380 --> 02:09:33.520
I mean they killed everybody.

2259
02:09:33.521 --> 02:09:37.210
I think they let some kids out at one point in time.
Yeah.
Some of them got out,

2260
02:09:37.211 --> 02:09:39.220
but a lot of them got burned and it was terrible.

2261
02:09:39.220 --> 02:09:41.950
There's a documentary about it that was kind of jaw dropping.

2262
02:09:42.100 --> 02:09:45.280
Well the documentary was highlighting the use of force and that was like one of

2263
02:09:45.281 --> 02:09:48.890
the first times where we saw like real military force being used on Tamil

2264
02:09:48.970 --> 02:09:52.570
civilians and,
and,
and the good news is that you sh,
you know,
a lot of people,

2265
02:09:52.571 --> 02:09:55.660
there was a documentary made out of it and a lot of people were pretty outraged

2266
02:09:55.661 --> 02:09:58.660
by it.
But yeah,
maybe not enough.
Hicks had a whole bid on it,

2267
02:09:59.460 --> 02:10:03.310
picks out a whole bid on it.
It was,
uh,
it was pretty fucking crazy.
It was just,

2268
02:10:03.490 --> 02:10:06.910
most people didn't see it because there was no fucking internet back then.

2269
02:10:07.150 --> 02:10:08.380
It wasn't like today.

2270
02:10:08.590 --> 02:10:12.910
If they did some Waco Shit today and we saw them driving over buildings and

2271
02:10:12.911 --> 02:10:17.740
blowing fire into these buildings,
pull up the video of Waco,
pull up the video.

2272
02:10:17.920 --> 02:10:20.170
What do you do when you checking your Facebook?
You Fuck,
look at those.

2273
02:10:20.171 --> 02:10:20.620
Look at that.

2274
02:10:20.620 --> 02:10:23.740
Look at what happened with Ferguson that this black kid who was shot.
I mean,

2275
02:10:23.820 --> 02:10:26.620
that whole town went crazy.
Things are different now.
It's different.

2276
02:10:26.650 --> 02:10:30.070
It's not that easy to just get away with shit anymore.
I also think though,

2277
02:10:30.071 --> 02:10:33.920
like I was thinking about Russia and how outdated they're calling the

2278
02:10:34.010 --> 02:10:36.830
<v 1>ruble,
the currency,
the rubble now because it's just like,</v>

2279
02:10:36.860 --> 02:10:40.280
it's just not worth anything.
It's a one copy.
It's very clever.

2280
02:10:41.260 --> 02:10:44.660
Play Underwood.
But it's a,
it's a one crop economy.
So Russia,

2281
02:10:45.120 --> 02:10:48.170
the motto is basically might makes right all the guys with guns control

2282
02:10:48.171 --> 02:10:50.930
everything.
Guess what?
So now you got,
you got commodities,

2283
02:10:50.931 --> 02:10:53.510
you've got oil that you export and I get some weaponry.

2284
02:10:54.900 --> 02:10:57.570
<v 0>This is crazy.
This was in the 1990s.</v>

2285
02:10:57.810 --> 02:11:02.810
This is a God damn tank tearing apart a house.

2286
02:11:03.330 --> 02:11:03.840
Yup.

2287
02:11:03.840 --> 02:11:08.490
This is a tank in America going into this quote unquote cult.

2288
02:11:09.600 --> 02:11:12.870
And because they had gotten into a firefight with these people because the ATF

2289
02:11:12.871 --> 02:11:15.450
shot at them,
the ATF,
they were like on the roofs and shit.

2290
02:11:15.451 --> 02:11:17.730
It's a really crazy documentary.
And one of the guys,

2291
02:11:17.940 --> 02:11:21.140
the ATF guy inside was shooting out the door at eight

2292
02:11:21.400 --> 02:11:24.490
<v 1>people outside and they were making,
they were blasting,
um,</v>

2293
02:11:24.670 --> 02:11:27.700
I guess music and stuff to make them crazy and noise.

2294
02:11:28.180 --> 02:11:32.080
<v 0>What did they do that with these guys too?
Yeah.
That's a common tactic.</v>

2295
02:11:32.500 --> 02:11:35.650
Why is the music that I was seeing if that was the music,
I hope that's not,

2296
02:11:35.651 --> 02:11:39.280
to me it is.
It
is that really,

2297
02:11:39.940 --> 02:11:44.020
it's the music that goes with the video.
Better get us pulled up youtube.

2298
02:11:44.770 --> 02:11:48.580
That's what that music is.
This is ridiculous.

2299
02:11:48.670 --> 02:11:52.330
I mean to see tanks being used on civilians,

2300
02:11:52.870 --> 02:11:57.280
helicopters and shit.
Oh Damn.
Okay.

2301
02:11:57.281 --> 02:12:01.950
But then if you look at it from the other hand,
like this is bizarre.

2302
02:12:02.340 --> 02:12:06.370
Nanos Jesus,
how fast that thing as you look at it from the other side,

2303
02:12:06.520 --> 02:12:09.430
if you've got a group of people that are in this house and they're shooting at

2304
02:12:09.431 --> 02:12:14.040
federal agents,
what do you do?
Do you do this?
Do you do this

2305
02:12:14.220 --> 02:12:17.520
<v 1>wait amount?
Do you wait from stars on fire?
That's what you don't do that.</v>

2306
02:12:17.760 --> 02:12:20.370
You definitely know when kids are in there.
So what do you do?

2307
02:12:20.430 --> 02:12:21.263
So the question was,

2308
02:12:21.450 --> 02:12:25.260
I think that the idea was floated that they started to fire themselves within

2309
02:12:25.261 --> 02:12:27.120
the compound and the ATF did not.

2310
02:12:28.580 --> 02:12:33.090
And that's not true.
That's not true.
They did.
They did the shit with,

2311
02:12:33.360 --> 02:12:37.260
with tanks.
Well,
the aerial view of the tanks just suggest something different.

2312
02:12:37.261 --> 02:12:39.180
I don't know.
What is the aerial view of the tanks?

2313
02:12:39.640 --> 02:12:44.190
Dr. Fox News suggests a vaguely using flame thrower.

2314
02:12:44.420 --> 02:12:48.730
<v 0>I did use flame,
dude.
Okay,
let's,
let's Google use of Flint.
I mean,</v>

2315
02:12:48.890 --> 02:12:52.830
I thought that was pretty established use of flame throwers and wait,

2316
02:12:52.890 --> 02:12:55.890
<v 1>well,
from the documentary they said it,
you know the,</v>

2317
02:12:56.050 --> 02:12:58.350
the big question was where was it started?

2318
02:12:58.351 --> 02:13:03.351
Inside the compound was the fire started by the Waco call members or by the ATF

2319
02:13:05.780 --> 02:13:05.780
Hidden Waco

2320
02:13:05.780 --> 02:13:06.470
<v 0>footage.</v>

2321
02:13:06.470 --> 02:13:11.390
Tanks used flame throwers and there's a link and you can go to the youtube video

2322
02:13:11.840 --> 02:13:16.840
and the Youtube video is unavailable and trusting proves it's bullshit.

2323
02:13:19.120 --> 02:13:21.980
Uh,
Waco tank,
flame thrower on Youtube,

2324
02:13:25.380 --> 02:13:28.970
third hole is made at the front door to sounds like some chem trail.
Shit.

2325
02:13:29.900 --> 02:13:31.730
Each picture is collapsing.

2326
02:13:32.290 --> 02:13:34.390
<v 1>Oh,
that's a thing.
When you read the,
when the Internet,
you don't know</v>

2327
02:13:34.560 --> 02:13:35.020
<v 7>all of them.</v>

2328
02:13:35.020 --> 02:13:39.730
Footage proves beyond any doubt that the tanks intentionally set the house on

2329
02:13:39.731 --> 02:13:43.480
fire.
It proves that the branch Davidians were murdered.

2330
02:13:44.410 --> 02:13:48.970
Watch carefully as the tank backs out of the house.
Watch carefully as a tank.

2331
02:13:48.971 --> 02:13:53.130
Backs out of the house.
Tank has a gas jet on the front that shoots fire.

2332
02:13:53.260 --> 02:13:57.790
<v 1>Oh,
that is true.
Google Waco tank,
flame thrower.
This is pretty fucked up,
Brian.</v>

2333
02:13:58.060 --> 02:14:00.190
I think this is going to turn you over.
You're going to be working for CNN.

2334
02:14:00.200 --> 02:14:03.790
I know you guys.
You're going to be in Ted Turner's pocket.

2335
02:14:03.791 --> 02:14:06.440
Fox News is going to fucking fire you.
Yeah,
you're gonna.

2336
02:14:06.460 --> 02:14:08.740
You're gonna go dark on this one.
You're going to go left wing.

2337
02:14:08.930 --> 02:14:12.160
I know is I got my deer tags,
my friend.
I got my dear tex to hey,
watch.

2338
02:14:12.161 --> 02:14:14.560
This third hole is made at the front door.

2339
02:14:14.650 --> 02:14:17.290
Go towards like a with the ears and experience.

2340
02:14:17.540 --> 02:14:21.800
<v 7>Picture is collapsing the inside stairwell.
Okay,
here it's good.
Keep going.</v>

2341
02:14:21.801 --> 02:14:26.330
The following footage proves beyond any doubt that the tanks intentionally set

2342
02:14:26.331 --> 02:14:30.920
the house on fire.
It proves that the branch Davidians were murdered.

2343
02:14:31.700 --> 02:14:34.580
Watch carefully as the tank backs out of the house.

2344
02:14:35.620 --> 02:14:40.550
She sounds like she did.
This tank has a gas jet on the front that shoots fire.

2345
02:14:40.700 --> 02:14:44.420
You can also see the fire quite plainly.
That's true.

2346
02:14:44.450 --> 02:14:47.870
Tank goes into the house twice and each time as it backs out,

2347
02:14:48.170 --> 02:14:50.980
the fire at the gas jets is plainly visible.
Wow.

2348
02:14:51.290 --> 02:14:55.220
<v 1>Yeah,
Dude.
Tailor that house on fire.
Wow.</v>

2349
02:14:56.660 --> 02:14:59.960
Where are you at now?
Fox News.
What is a man?

2350
02:15:00.080 --> 02:15:02.510
I think they lived at a house on fire.
What are you feeling like Fox News?

2351
02:15:02.511 --> 02:15:06.070
I'll tell you that much.
Uh,
I would,
I don't know.
I,
I believe,
I believe,
uh,

2352
02:15:06.150 --> 02:15:08.540
that they set that house on fire.
I don't,
I don't have any doubt.

2353
02:15:08.570 --> 02:15:10.550
You get those guys have gear geared up.
Yeah.

2354
02:15:10.700 --> 02:15:12.560
They got shot at some of the guys got shot.

2355
02:15:12.610 --> 02:15:15.230
They got men are men and they're going to be vindictive.

2356
02:15:15.231 --> 02:15:16.060
They're going to do whatever.

2357
02:15:16.060 --> 02:15:19.070
They're all so soldiers and they've given in the given an enemy.

2358
02:15:19.100 --> 02:15:21.800
You know that old expression.
Exactly right.
If you only have a hammer,

2359
02:15:21.980 --> 02:15:25.820
everything looks like a nail nail.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I don't have any doubt about,
okay,

2360
02:15:25.821 --> 02:15:26.654
but here's the question.

2361
02:15:26.750 --> 02:15:31.130
What do you do if you know that there's a group that's hold up and they have a

2362
02:15:31.131 --> 02:15:31.670
bunch of weapons?

2363
02:15:31.670 --> 02:15:33.590
I'm not saying he should set the place on fire and killed the kids,

2364
02:15:33.591 --> 02:15:36.470
but I'm saying what,
how do you handle that?
How do you,

2365
02:15:36.500 --> 02:15:40.470
you got a guy who's shooting at federal agents allegedly there is that the

2366
02:15:40.520 --> 02:15:42.830
reality,
the agents,
they were being broken into.

2367
02:15:43.040 --> 02:15:45.830
Agents accidentally shot at themselves.
That is a fact.

2368
02:15:45.831 --> 02:15:46.760
You can also hear the guy say,

2369
02:15:46.761 --> 02:15:49.820
I have a right to defend myself as they're breaking in.
He shoots.

2370
02:15:50.060 --> 02:15:53.510
So a lot of it was he was in his home,
people were coming in,
he didn't,

2371
02:15:53.750 --> 02:15:57.080
he didn't know who was coming into his house.
They had guns.
You know,

2372
02:15:57.081 --> 02:16:00.200
you can make an argument for a lot of this stuff,
so,
oh yeah.
I,

2373
02:16:00.201 --> 02:16:02.270
what do you do in that situation?
Do you do,

2374
02:16:02.330 --> 02:16:05.270
I suppose the first thing you should think about is there two things.

2375
02:16:05.570 --> 02:16:08.480
One is our children being abused to his,

2376
02:16:08.481 --> 02:16:11.240
does he have illegal weapon at an illegal arsenal?

2377
02:16:11.420 --> 02:16:14.540
So if those are the two cases you get a search warrant,
they tried to get in,

2378
02:16:14.541 --> 02:16:17.510
they were denied access,
the rest is a standoff.

2379
02:16:17.511 --> 02:16:21.020
I don't know that that comes out and police tactics.
Right?
Yeah.

2380
02:16:21.050 --> 02:16:25.430
I mean do you think that someone should be allowed to have a place like that?

2381
02:16:25.490 --> 02:16:27.560
Like if you believe that people should be allowed to have guns.

2382
02:16:28.010 --> 02:16:30.250
Like I have friends who have many

2383
02:16:30.250 --> 02:16:34.460
<v 0>guns.
My friend Justin is like a legit bonafide gun.
Yup.</v>

2384
02:16:34.720 --> 02:16:37.540
He didn't even know how many guns he has now.

2385
02:16:37.660 --> 02:16:42.660
What if Justin got together with 50 of his friends and they're all like him and

2386
02:16:44.471 --> 02:16:48.850
they rented a big fucking piece of land or they bought a big piece of land

2387
02:16:48.851 --> 02:16:51.310
together,
put a few houses up and then put a fence around it.

2388
02:16:51.400 --> 02:16:55.030
I think I'm fine with that,
right?
Because I believe in that,
you know,

2389
02:16:55.031 --> 02:16:57.850
freedom of assembly.
Right?
But what is that?

2390
02:16:57.910 --> 02:17:01.150
You've got a highly armed compound of a bunch of gun nuts.

2391
02:17:01.210 --> 02:17:04.000
It still falls within the confines of the law.
Now,
if that,

2392
02:17:04.030 --> 02:17:08.470
if they have fully automatic machine guns,
Turret guns and rockets,

2393
02:17:08.800 --> 02:17:12.460
you're going to go,
hold on.
Do you guys have a license for those?
And you know,

2394
02:17:12.461 --> 02:17:15.640
there are a whole lot of measures and then you'd have to take steps to make sure

2395
02:17:15.641 --> 02:17:20.410
that you don't,
you don't have an army with a bunch of illegal weapons.

2396
02:17:20.411 --> 02:17:22.240
There's a reason there's some weapons that are,

2397
02:17:22.450 --> 02:17:24.220
nothing's illegal if you have a license for it.

2398
02:17:24.640 --> 02:17:28.950
Do you know the thing fifth correct shot himself or was shot by his,

2399
02:17:29.140 --> 02:17:33.010
his people.
Really?
Yeah.
They think he was shot before he,
um,

2400
02:17:33.940 --> 02:17:34.181
yeah,

2401
02:17:34.181 --> 02:17:38.860
Koresh and about two dozen other shot themselves to death or were shot before

2402
02:17:38.861 --> 02:17:40.780
the fire and Gulf.
The entire compound.

2403
02:17:41.050 --> 02:17:45.020
Others died in the fire or the rubble of the collapsing building.
Geez,

2404
02:17:46.750 --> 02:17:50.020
that's dark.
The shoot out.
Yeah.
It's a crabbing.

2405
02:17:50.050 --> 02:17:52.070
They were fucking arm to the tits.

2406
02:17:52.760 --> 02:17:56.990
<v 8>The branch Davidians.
God,
this is crazy.
Watch this.</v>

2407
02:17:57.950 --> 02:18:00.260
They become the target of a madman.
Spirit

2408
02:18:04.220 --> 02:18:08.330
according to intelligent weapons in this room.
So look,

2409
02:18:08.870 --> 02:18:10.790
we'll shoot anyone who tries to infiltrate.

2410
02:18:11.870 --> 02:18:14.380
Dudes shooting through the wall.

2411
02:18:16.490 --> 02:18:19.550
Agent Shoulder.
They shot each other.

2412
02:18:23.180 --> 02:18:24.800
<v 0>So the agents went in</v>

2413
02:18:24.840 --> 02:18:27.840
<v 8>side or directly in the lineup.
Buyer,
they're shooting.</v>

2414
02:18:28.620 --> 02:18:30.690
<v 0>They shot through the walls and shot their own agents.</v>

2415
02:18:30.750 --> 02:18:34.230
<v 8>He's blending or dash and the fallen comrades retreat.</v>

2416
02:18:35.970 --> 02:18:38.730
ATF agents were killed and 16 wounded.

2417
02:18:39.030 --> 02:18:40.170
<v 0>Fucking hey man.</v>

2418
02:18:41.610 --> 02:18:46.530
16 one time to heal for dead.
That's a blood gas.
That's a blood.
That right there.

2419
02:18:46.540 --> 02:18:49.470
You got those guys.
Good luck.
Now you're in a war.

2420
02:18:49.530 --> 02:18:52.020
You want to mess around with those kind of guys who gear up.
We're already tough.

2421
02:18:52.500 --> 02:18:55.920
And that's their job.
And you and you killed for their friends.
I want to get it.

2422
02:18:56.010 --> 02:18:58.770
I wouldn't be too sympathetic either at that point.
I was one of those guys.

2423
02:18:58.830 --> 02:19:02.400
Right,
but devil's advocate,
this is not my,
my feelings on this.

2424
02:19:02.401 --> 02:19:05.400
I don't have formed feelings on us.
I don't either by the way.

2425
02:19:05.401 --> 02:19:10.380
But those guys broken these people's houses.
For what reason?
Uh,

2426
02:19:10.620 --> 02:19:15.600
apparently he was in violation.
I think of two things.
A weapons,

2427
02:19:15.630 --> 02:19:17.880
uh,
illegal weapons caches or whatever.

2428
02:19:17.881 --> 02:19:21.870
And also I think there was a warrant for the fact that he was having sex with

2429
02:19:21.871 --> 02:19:24.960
underage girls.
Child endangerment.
Yeah.
Child child endangerment,

2430
02:19:25.230 --> 02:19:27.550
which is kind of a legit,
if he's running call,

2431
02:19:28.220 --> 02:19:30.830
<v 2>my friend used to date this chick who grew up in,
I called and she,</v>

2432
02:19:30.831 --> 02:19:33.830
and he said that she would tell him horrible fucking store.

2433
02:19:33.831 --> 02:19:36.500
That's why a lot of guys start cults so they can get pussy.

2434
02:19:37.010 --> 02:19:40.700
Well didn't Koresh like had a deal where he could bang everybody's wife if he

2435
02:19:40.701 --> 02:19:44.420
was smart?
Yeah,
that was his thing.

2436
02:19:44.421 --> 02:19:46.470
His thing is he could bang everybody's white.
You could be in my,

2437
02:19:46.760 --> 02:19:51.350
you can be in my cult.
Here's the only catch 22 don't they always do that though?

2438
02:19:51.410 --> 02:19:54.200
Everybody,
Jim Jones probably banged everybody's wants to,
man.
We're all,

2439
02:19:54.201 --> 02:19:58.160
we're all one.
People were all love.
It's all about love.
I am the Alpha male.

2440
02:19:58.190 --> 02:20:00.930
I don't know what,
that's what I'm saying.
I think he was saying he's god Bro.

2441
02:20:00.970 --> 02:20:05.330
All right,
well there's also that they all look the same like him,

2442
02:20:05.480 --> 02:20:06.740
the Australian Jesus,

2443
02:20:06.860 --> 02:20:10.520
you can put them side by side and they're like interchangeable.
Did these weeds.

2444
02:20:10.521 --> 02:20:11.241
That guy's great.

2445
02:20:11.241 --> 02:20:16.241
This Russell Australia Duncan lifts to tool to wild was so lame.

2446
02:20:16.521 --> 02:20:18.230
He's just like,
I'm Jesus.
Well no,

2447
02:20:18.231 --> 02:20:21.470
he's Lamer than lame cause he's told two different chicks that there Mary,

2448
02:20:21.770 --> 02:20:24.830
like his game as he tells the chick that you're married,

2449
02:20:24.860 --> 02:20:26.840
that I'm Jesus and you're married like,
oh,

2450
02:20:26.870 --> 02:20:31.820
get the fuck out of Tom and superstitious type.
The documentary is,
well,

2451
02:20:31.821 --> 02:20:36.020
he's not dumb.
He's pretty clever,
right?
But for the poor girl,

2452
02:20:36.230 --> 02:20:40.130
he has this girl that's convinced that she's married and she's crying and she's

2453
02:20:40.131 --> 02:20:43.430
crying and she's talking about remembering him being on the cross.

2454
02:20:44.360 --> 02:20:48.230
It's fucking madness.
And then afterwards he's being interviewed by the guy.

2455
02:20:48.280 --> 02:20:50.390
The guy was interviewing him was pretty slick and he's like,

2456
02:20:50.391 --> 02:20:54.620
didn't you tell another girl that she was married?
I was like,
um,
yes,

2457
02:20:54.621 --> 02:20:59.410
but I was wrong.
See what I mean?
He plays shittiest excuse.

2458
02:20:59.540 --> 02:21:02.870
Like the shitty is,
wait bro.
I would have so much of a better way.

2459
02:21:02.871 --> 02:21:06.500
I can lie right now and come up with a better idea.
Yes.
But I was wrong.

2460
02:21:06.710 --> 02:21:08.960
But it's even better than that.
He plays Green Day.

2461
02:21:10.250 --> 02:21:13.320
He's seen there and he's playing a green day song.
He's incredible.

2462
02:21:13.790 --> 02:21:18.060
You telling me that the Australian Jesus would be really in the green bay?

2463
02:21:18.700 --> 02:21:22.490
Like I just got to think there's gotta be a better song for him.
I don't know.

2464
02:21:22.491 --> 02:21:25.850
He's got like six followers.
He's got quite a few really devoted.

2465
02:21:25.851 --> 02:21:26.810
It's in Queensland.

2466
02:21:27.670 --> 02:21:31.670
He's got to crying and said he's got a giant compound and it's getting bigger.

2467
02:21:31.760 --> 02:21:36.410
Yeah.
Yeah.
There's a lot of people are very worried about him.
Really?
Yes.
Yes.

2468
02:21:36.470 --> 02:21:39.080
I mean,
he's a legit cult leader.
Wow.
I mean he really has,

2469
02:21:39.230 --> 02:21:40.340
I mean it's an enormous,

2470
02:21:40.370 --> 02:21:44.090
I just feel like it's a huge magnet for the dummies with this society.

2471
02:21:44.090 --> 02:21:44.970
So there's a lot of,

2472
02:21:45.440 --> 02:21:48.560
it's like kind of like fly paper where it's just get all the,
it just sucks.

2473
02:21:48.561 --> 02:21:52.850
All the really dumb people in one area.
It's fine.

2474
02:21:52.880 --> 02:21:55.820
Let them know it's not,
it's not because then they can take over.

2475
02:21:56.060 --> 02:22:01.060
See the thing about having a really big group of dumb people as a big group of

2476
02:22:01.281 --> 02:22:04.580
people that are so dumb,
they don't even know they're dumb.
So there's no leaders.

2477
02:22:04.581 --> 02:22:08.840
There are a giant map of retarded followers and they're chasing after a guy

2478
02:22:09.170 --> 02:22:11.000
who's a fake Jesus who likes Green Day.

2479
02:22:11.001 --> 02:22:14.600
I mean this is like the numbers that a guy like that can draw.

2480
02:22:14.601 --> 02:22:17.600
The reason why it's fucked up.
It's because if you look at the whole population,

2481
02:22:17.960 --> 02:22:20.330
let's just go with America,
cause I don't know how big Australia is,

2482
02:22:20.480 --> 02:22:22.460
but if America's 300 million people,

2483
02:22:22.940 --> 02:22:25.980
what percent do you think are just

2484
02:22:25.980 --> 02:22:29.820
<v 0>so fucking dumb?
They almost can't think things through for themselves.</v>

2485
02:22:30.030 --> 02:22:33.240
I'd say it's 1% that's all you need.

2486
02:22:33.390 --> 02:22:35.190
If you have 1% in America,

2487
02:22:35.340 --> 02:22:40.170
you have 3.5 million dummies.

2488
02:22:40.680 --> 02:22:44.730
That is a staggering number of dummies.
If you really laid it out like that,

2489
02:22:44.731 --> 02:22:48.780
if it's truly one out of a hundred which is probably being super generous

2490
02:22:49.020 --> 02:22:50.010
because the human race,

2491
02:22:50.310 --> 02:22:55.310
but if it really is one out of a hundred that's 3.5 million in this country

2492
02:22:56.340 --> 02:23:00.690
alone,
you don't need that many to start a good call.
Shit.

2493
02:23:01.410 --> 02:23:02.630
Yeah.
But what does that call doing?

2494
02:23:02.670 --> 02:23:07.260
Aren't they just kind of living the Gospel and,
and is Jesus like Dayton?
Right?

2495
02:23:07.261 --> 02:23:11.100
There's a lot of sex.
He's uh,
he's got a lot going on,
man.

2496
02:23:11.190 --> 02:23:15.000
He's got a big ass place.
How big is it?
Um,

2497
02:23:15.030 --> 02:23:19.230
he used to be an Australian,
a it specialist there in Queensland's.
I mean,

2498
02:23:19.231 --> 02:23:22.620
it's not like Queensland is,
you know,
he's got a big spot dude,

2499
02:23:22.621 --> 02:23:25.620
he's just separately Monday,
Queensland.
But whatever.

2500
02:23:25.710 --> 02:23:28.050
I think he has like 600 acres or something up there.

2501
02:23:28.080 --> 02:23:30.000
That's where they find the monster great whites.

2502
02:23:30.360 --> 02:23:33.090
That's where they find great whites that are 22 feet that have a bite out of

2503
02:23:33.091 --> 02:23:34.560
them from a bigger great white

2504
02:23:36.900 --> 02:23:39.630
600 acres or something like that.
Cause Koresh.
Let's see.

2505
02:23:39.631 --> 02:23:40.740
They always have good hair.

2506
02:23:40.770 --> 02:23:43.710
Look at Duncan Trussell caress was actually a good looking guy.

2507
02:23:45.750 --> 02:23:49.530
Yeah.
Koresh was in bad looking.
No great hair.

2508
02:23:50.190 --> 02:23:53.940
Scruff.
But they look similar.
If you look at him and then pull up the Australian.

2509
02:23:53.941 --> 02:23:56.910
Jesus.
No,
not trolley Manson.
The Australian.
Jesus.

2510
02:23:57.630 --> 02:24:02.370
That guy looks very similar.
I'm going to cut my hair for our hunting trip.
Dude.

2511
02:24:02.520 --> 02:24:05.430
I'm looking at your head.
You're going to go crazy in it down.
Bring it down.

2512
02:24:05.870 --> 02:24:09.660
I'll do it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
We're going to,
what time are we going?
I'm all,
let's not,

2513
02:24:10.050 --> 02:24:13.350
sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry about all the personal stuff.

2514
02:24:14.220 --> 02:24:18.420
This guy,
um,
yeah,
he has 600 plus acres,

2515
02:24:19.530 --> 02:24:24.060
chilling cult transcript,
whatever.
That's a lot of fucking Queensland.

2516
02:24:24.180 --> 02:24:28.920
But he looked so much.
Look at him,
Brian.
Oh he looks so much like Koresh.
Ah,

2517
02:24:28.950 --> 02:24:33.330
he's so he's got sharp features.
Maybe it is correct,
but look at them.

2518
02:24:33.950 --> 02:24:37.260
Escape to both.
Got that weird beard where they can't grow up man's beard.

2519
02:24:37.261 --> 02:24:40.950
So they grow this fucking yes,
correct.
Might have gotten his nose sharpened.

2520
02:24:41.310 --> 02:24:45.700
It could be him and his hair straightened.
I think that's Kuresh stock control.

2521
02:24:47.960 --> 02:24:52.800
Dunkin Dunkins more wild eyed.
I'm telling you,
this guy is so silly.

2522
02:24:52.830 --> 02:24:56.780
When you got into that,
he,
when he got into that health thing that uh,

2523
02:24:57.090 --> 02:24:59.760
when he was like hanging out with the Church of Satan guy though.

2524
02:24:59.820 --> 02:25:03.810
That was hilariously funny though.
He does it for funny,
but it was funny.

2525
02:25:04.260 --> 02:25:09.150
I remember when he did that show for the uh,
heading.
Yeah.
For which guy?

2526
02:25:09.210 --> 02:25:12.780
Anton Levay Sun was hilarious.
Hank third.

2527
02:25:12.781 --> 02:25:17.660
Hank Williams Jr Danzig.
Junior.
Junior,
Hank the third played there.
Yeah.

2528
02:25:17.880 --> 02:25:21.270
It was just all crazy chaos man.
Who's your favorite front man?
All the time.

2529
02:25:21.990 --> 02:25:25.780
For what rock?
Yup.
I don't know.
I never thought about it.

2530
02:25:25.781 --> 02:25:27.820
What are we in high school?
Who Do you,
who's your favorite doing?

2531
02:25:27.850 --> 02:25:30.460
What do you think is the greatest was yours.
You must have one.

2532
02:25:30.790 --> 02:25:33.490
Otherwise he wouldn't have started either Robert plant or Freddie Mercury,

2533
02:25:33.491 --> 02:25:37.630
but I'm not sure.
I'm toss up between the two.
Yeah.
Robert Plant's right up there.

2534
02:25:38.920 --> 02:25:41.440
You know,
nobody had Mick Jagger's right up there too though.

2535
02:25:41.980 --> 02:25:44.170
Mick Jagger's up there.
But the problem with the stones,

2536
02:25:44.171 --> 02:25:46.140
and no one's gonna like to hear this,
they don't,
right.

2537
02:25:46.240 --> 02:25:50.860
They had a lot of shitty songs and the song well in forever,

2538
02:25:51.580 --> 02:25:54.970
but they had some fucking monsters.
They had a few monsters.

2539
02:25:54.971 --> 02:25:56.710
But when you pick up their albums,

2540
02:25:56.860 --> 02:26:00.400
like there's a bunch of Zeppelin songs that no one talks about that are fucking

2541
02:26:00.401 --> 02:26:03.400
phenomenal,
you know,
you'll,
you'll listen to them,
you're like,
Ooh,

2542
02:26:03.401 --> 02:26:06.220
I forgot about this.
You know,
this is still a beautiful,

2543
02:26:06.250 --> 02:26:09.490
and then you have some stone song.
You're like,
what is this?

2544
02:26:10.660 --> 02:26:12.310
Shut this fucking thing off.
Yeah.

2545
02:26:13.490 --> 02:26:18.040
I think definitely as the number one,
Ben.
Yeah,
but didn't Zeplin steal a lot?

2546
02:26:18.041 --> 02:26:21.280
13 songs.
They didn't credit and they didn't credit.

2547
02:26:21.340 --> 02:26:26.340
Oh either old time folk songs or blues or musicians that we,

2548
02:26:26.550 --> 02:26:30.730
they were influenced,
I mean dazed and confused and that certain songs where,

2549
02:26:31.310 --> 02:26:34.600
I mean if you hearing or a direct rip off and never credited them.

2550
02:26:34.840 --> 02:26:38.230
We played that and we do,
we play the both of them back to back.

2551
02:26:38.530 --> 02:26:42.040
There was a video that had a,
all the old blues songs,

2552
02:26:42.070 --> 02:26:46.780
like the lyrics from them and then made him a lot better though.
I mean,

2553
02:26:46.840 --> 02:26:47.860
and a lot better.

2554
02:26:48.010 --> 02:26:51.310
It just seems like those guys should've got something if there were still alive

2555
02:26:51.400 --> 02:26:55.660
and they did,
they went back and they um,
there was some settle out of court,

2556
02:26:55.661 --> 02:27:00.360
but you know,
sit.
They Fox News,
Fox News.

2557
02:27:00.370 --> 02:27:03.670
I Hate Fox News.
I'm really mad at you would work for them.

2558
02:27:03.760 --> 02:27:07.690
I would be like that Alan Colmes billion years more manly.
I'd be like,

2559
02:27:07.691 --> 02:27:11.590
you can have like the left wing guy on.
I'll fuck guys.
I just be fair man.

2560
02:27:11.620 --> 02:27:14.200
What they made you wear a dress like those hot girls.
You're not,

2561
02:27:14.470 --> 02:27:17.620
I don't think they're fair.
I don't think they're fell.
No,
I don't.
I don't.

2562
02:27:17.650 --> 02:27:18.810
I think that they,

2563
02:27:19.180 --> 02:27:22.660
I don't like getting my news from an ideological point of view.

2564
02:27:22.661 --> 02:27:24.370
I'd rather get BBC,
I listen to BBC.

2565
02:27:24.800 --> 02:27:29.800
You do you think it's possible to have a news channel on television that's

2566
02:27:30.040 --> 02:27:33.220
undefined?
It doesn't slam left.
It doesn't slap right.

2567
02:27:33.340 --> 02:27:38.340
That at least was the model and that was I think the BBC and a lot of ways it

2568
02:27:40.351 --> 02:27:42.910
comes very close to it.
Maybe I'm wrong,
but but not there.

2569
02:27:42.911 --> 02:27:45.070
I'm talking about here in good old us of that.

2570
02:27:45.071 --> 02:27:47.890
I think it is the land of the free home of the brave is in fact one of the

2571
02:27:47.891 --> 02:27:48.431
things that they had,

2572
02:27:48.431 --> 02:27:51.430
the guy who was the guy who ran 60 minutes came in and said,

2573
02:27:51.730 --> 02:27:52.720
good news and bad news.

2574
02:27:52.721 --> 02:27:55.300
Good news is we got the highest rating of any new show ever.

2575
02:27:55.420 --> 02:27:58.870
Bad News is we got the highest rating of any new show ever.
In other words,

2576
02:27:58.871 --> 02:28:02.410
this just turned into a show that's dependent on ratings.

2577
02:28:02.700 --> 02:28:04.690
That's why we're all going to get paid a lot more money.
Well,

2578
02:28:04.691 --> 02:28:06.730
that's the infinite growth paradigm,
right?

2579
02:28:06.760 --> 02:28:09.700
It exists in corporations and it also exists on shows.

2580
02:28:10.080 --> 02:28:14.500
They want the ratings to go up.
The ratings are up,
up,
up.
Yeah.
So 100%,

2581
02:28:15.160 --> 02:28:17.560
when you see shit on Isis has guys on come on a show.

2582
02:28:17.561 --> 02:28:20.140
That's him being a Fox show.
Yeah,
you're on Fox.

2583
02:28:20.500 --> 02:28:24.650
You're the fuckers sabotage me.

2584
02:28:26.420 --> 02:28:30.890
That was,
that was that morning show to promote my,
my standards.
Not the same.

2585
02:28:30.891 --> 02:28:32.380
That's not real.
Fox Fox,

2586
02:28:32.381 --> 02:28:37.010
that's Emmett political shows are the weirdest fucking form of show business.

2587
02:28:37.510 --> 02:28:40.670
It feels local morning shows and it's changed markets.

2588
02:28:40.790 --> 02:28:43.880
These local shows are the weirdest form of show business ever.
Yeah,

2589
02:28:44.300 --> 02:28:47.210
some of them are great.
Yup.
And some of them are so bad.

2590
02:28:47.360 --> 02:28:50.300
You can't believe this isn't a school play.
You're like,

2591
02:28:50.390 --> 02:28:53.540
I am on a school play with cameras on it.
Well,
I love the journey.

2592
02:28:53.570 --> 02:28:58.040
A lot of them are just so bubbly and just,
it's just strange man.

2593
02:28:58.100 --> 02:29:00.860
Just fake dude.
And some of them are so bad.

2594
02:29:00.861 --> 02:29:05.330
I went on one won't name the name.
Um,
immediately guys,

2595
02:29:05.331 --> 02:29:09.290
first question was,
so,
um,
what was it like when Phil Hartman was killed?

2596
02:29:11.980 --> 02:29:15.500
And I just Sorta,
I started blank faced him.
I go was terrible.

2597
02:29:16.550 --> 02:29:19.190
Like one,
one word answer.
Like I'm gonna give you a one word answer for that.

2598
02:29:19.220 --> 02:29:23.150
I'm not going to elaborate and expand,
but that's his opening question.

2599
02:29:23.680 --> 02:29:26.660
It's like you saw that video where Mike Tyson was talking to the guy in Canada

2600
02:29:26.661 --> 02:29:28.850
and the fucking opening statement that guy says,

2601
02:29:29.090 --> 02:29:33.200
is this going to hurt the mayor because you were,
you went to jail for rape.

2602
02:29:33.410 --> 02:29:36.350
You're convicted rapist,
rapist or convicted rapist.
Yeah.

2603
02:29:36.770 --> 02:29:40.550
I couldn't believe that right away.
Cheap shot.
What is shitty cheap shot that's,

2604
02:29:40.700 --> 02:29:43.430
people love doing that shit.
They love doing that shit.

2605
02:29:43.460 --> 02:29:46.510
I think Mike Tyson handled it appropriately.
The handled it the right way.

2606
02:29:46.550 --> 02:29:48.470
A piece of shit.
So what's more stressful?

2607
02:29:48.471 --> 02:29:51.650
I was dealing with a piece of shit that you thought a positive here,

2608
02:29:51.651 --> 02:29:55.670
but you'll be even your piece of shit.
Yeah.
That dude was terrified.

2609
02:29:55.760 --> 02:29:59.740
He looked into the eyes of death.
Yeah,
man.
And Tyson didn't even fuck it.

2610
02:29:59.750 --> 02:30:03.410
His heart didn't even skip a beat.
There wasn't like an extra beat to it.

2611
02:30:03.411 --> 02:30:05.390
Everything stayed nice and calm.
Change that guy.

2612
02:30:05.391 --> 02:30:08.180
He's probably wondering whether or not I should be the show.
This guy on the air,

2613
02:30:08.360 --> 02:30:10.580
he's already cussing him down.
He's not going to beat him up,

2614
02:30:10.581 --> 02:30:12.860
but it's probably there floating around.

2615
02:30:12.861 --> 02:30:17.030
I'd be like if he just launched himself on this guy and just smashed his face

2616
02:30:17.031 --> 02:30:18.740
and it would feel so good for those brief seconds.

2617
02:30:18.741 --> 02:30:21.650
How much time would you have to do too much?
Not Worth it.
Don't do it.

2618
02:30:21.680 --> 02:30:25.910
Am I making him more famous?
He would go to jail for sure.
He imagined my,

2619
02:30:26.030 --> 02:30:28.430
well we'd be in Canada if you could get across the border real quick.

2620
02:30:28.431 --> 02:30:30.350
I thought we'd extradite him.
It's true actually.

2621
02:30:30.410 --> 02:30:34.640
Especially if the guy really did the guy moved at all and some sort of a

2622
02:30:34.641 --> 02:30:38.030
threatening way.
Call him a convicted rapist is the guy,

2623
02:30:38.031 --> 02:30:39.950
if he could get the guy to raise his hands up,

2624
02:30:40.100 --> 02:30:43.020
like just anything where it looks like the guy I did.
I did.

2625
02:30:43.490 --> 02:30:46.520
I did one of those things and after I'd done the hangover two and they asked me

2626
02:30:46.610 --> 02:30:51.020
about the experience and I started talking about the lady boys and how you know,

2627
02:30:51.080 --> 02:30:53.660
and they're,
it's a family show.
And I started saying,
look,

2628
02:30:53.661 --> 02:30:57.740
I mean I'm a straight man,
but those lady boys looked very female.
Man.

2629
02:30:57.741 --> 02:30:59.990
Did they get nervous?
They changed the subject and okay,

2630
02:30:59.991 --> 02:31:01.550
well that's the way you have not going to go there.

2631
02:31:01.551 --> 02:31:04.930
Well that's Brian can will be at such and such tonight and tomorrow.

2632
02:31:04.950 --> 02:31:09.050
And I got Jesus.
You got to shut me down real quick.
He live in a world of no fun.

2633
02:31:09.230 --> 02:31:13.070
It's really smelled of everything has to be like formal.
All right,

2634
02:31:13.190 --> 02:31:17.390
let's go over here to the board and take a look at the weather.
Well,

2635
02:31:17.450 --> 02:31:20.070
what we've got here is a cold front moving in.
That same

2636
02:31:20.070 --> 02:31:21.060
<v 2>guy has to do everything.</v>

2637
02:31:21.150 --> 02:31:26.150
That same guy has to do Tom Cruise in a bit of a blow up with Matt Lauer.

2638
02:31:27.960 --> 02:31:30.990
Oh,
we'll tell you about it when we get back.
Like who are you?

2639
02:31:31.050 --> 02:31:35.010
I know you don't exist in nature.
It's the strangest thing guys.

2640
02:31:35.011 --> 02:31:37.290
You just talk as though everything is just fantastic.

2641
02:31:37.291 --> 02:31:40.410
There's certain people that you know shouldn't exist in nature and they offend

2642
02:31:40.411 --> 02:31:44.340
you.
They're,
they're offensive and that's a fee.
There's something about that.

2643
02:31:44.341 --> 02:31:47.430
They're like,
okay,
I'll let you read the news,
I'll,
I'll let you,

2644
02:31:47.431 --> 02:31:48.510
I'll let you be the robot.

2645
02:31:48.660 --> 02:31:53.370
But if you fuck and try to give your opinion as that robot,
well,
you know,

2646
02:31:53.371 --> 02:31:57.900
these days are different than when we were kids and a guy like ray rice,

2647
02:31:58.620 --> 02:32:01.380
she just know better.
Like,
okay,
what do you do?
You just,

2648
02:32:01.470 --> 02:32:05.940
you just talked about some important shit and some weird fucking fake,

2649
02:32:06.310 --> 02:32:07.480
<v 1>I was just talking about that,</v>

2650
02:32:07.481 --> 02:32:11.020
about why I have a visceral kind of reaction to that kind of shit.

2651
02:32:11.290 --> 02:32:16.290
And I wonder if it's maybe because historically those kinds of dudes cock block

2652
02:32:18.030 --> 02:32:21.310
people.
Well they were also a liability,
right?
Fuck yeah.

2653
02:32:21.330 --> 02:32:25.290
Like you need somebody you can rely on when you go hunt for food or you got to

2654
02:32:25.330 --> 02:32:28.720
go to battle or whatever it might be,
which was mankind's history.

2655
02:32:29.680 --> 02:32:32.470
I wonder if those kinds of people were always people you basically,

2656
02:32:32.530 --> 02:32:37.360
cause when they talk that way,
they're not talking to you.
I don't trust you.

2657
02:32:37.390 --> 02:32:40.030
You're not being,
you know,
being real with me so I can't rely on you.

2658
02:32:40.150 --> 02:32:42.490
I think that's what it is.
I mean,
that's what I happened to me.

2659
02:32:42.491 --> 02:32:45.250
Even when I see a guy who's dressed super cool,

2660
02:32:45.251 --> 02:32:50.050
like there's a lot of time spent on,
he's watching himself.
I go,

2661
02:32:50.051 --> 02:32:53.360
oh boy.
I don't know man,
that looks good on you.
But I,

2662
02:32:53.470 --> 02:32:57.280
I'm just having a problem with that necklace and that hat too many rings on,

2663
02:32:57.310 --> 02:33:00.700
you've got too many rings on Matt really talked to you wearing like six rings.

2664
02:33:00.730 --> 02:33:04.550
I can't talk to you can't ultimately be friends with you.
That's my problem.
That

2665
02:33:04.550 --> 02:33:09.020
<v 2>character you can't trust.
Like that's Dr. Smith from lost in space.
Right.</v>

2666
02:33:09.021 --> 02:33:13.850
You can never count on Dr. Smith.
Oh do you will be a will.
He would give you up.

2667
02:33:13.851 --> 02:33:15.590
He would give you up to the aliens.
That's right.

2668
02:33:15.950 --> 02:33:19.010
If the aliens were going to kill him,
they like,
I'll tell you what they,
oh,

2669
02:33:19.100 --> 02:33:21.740
I'll tell you where they are.
And you're like,
Dr. Smith,
you fuck.

2670
02:33:21.890 --> 02:33:26.240
And the Dad who was always like rock solid with a square jaw kept letting Dr.

2671
02:33:26.240 --> 02:33:28.940
Smith and his silly little homo,
I'll let them back in.

2672
02:33:29.360 --> 02:33:34.010
Dr. Smith was clearly gay.
Never wanted to have anything to do with the wife,

2673
02:33:34.220 --> 02:33:36.830
was not,
I mean he was alone with no women.
He never did.

2674
02:33:36.850 --> 02:33:39.470
Never flirted with her and never imagined what it would be like.

2675
02:33:39.710 --> 02:33:43.010
He never said to him,
you're married.
I was just no women out here in space.

2676
02:33:43.011 --> 02:33:45.140
I mean,
you've got the best woman on earth.

2677
02:33:45.230 --> 02:33:47.120
There's nothing weird or creepy happened.

2678
02:33:47.540 --> 02:33:50.180
He was clearly an untrustworthy gay men.

2679
02:33:51.070 --> 02:33:55.400
It's probably one of the most homophobic characters ever because he was so weak.

2680
02:33:55.550 --> 02:33:58.460
He wasn't he me,
first of all,
he always watched the kids.

2681
02:33:58.700 --> 02:34:01.910
Like the guy was always watching the kids while the dad,

2682
02:34:01.911 --> 02:34:05.030
who was the fucking astronauts superhero was fucking saving the planet.

2683
02:34:05.060 --> 02:34:09.680
He was at hand.
He was sort of a hen.
Yeah.
He was a hen and he was weak.

2684
02:34:09.860 --> 02:34:13.340
He was so weak.
He was clearly gateway.
He told,

2685
02:34:14.950 --> 02:34:18.860
oh,
deal will.
He was just weak.
Yeah.

2686
02:34:19.030 --> 02:34:22.300
And clearly gay.
Like it was such a homophobic character,

2687
02:34:22.630 --> 02:34:25.720
but that was the only way anybody would ever accept a character like that on

2688
02:34:25.721 --> 02:34:28.450
television.
Yeah.
He had to have it.
He had to be feminized.
Yeah.

2689
02:34:28.690 --> 02:34:31.870
Like if he was in that position and he couldn't be trusted,

2690
02:34:31.990 --> 02:34:34.540
but he was very masculine and,
and,
and you know,

2691
02:34:35.470 --> 02:34:40.020
he'd be banging the astronauts white you when it would be a conflict.
Well,

2692
02:34:40.030 --> 02:34:40.900
after a while,

2693
02:34:40.901 --> 02:34:45.080
you're not even an Alpha male at home while you're gone off on expeditions.
It's,

2694
02:34:45.360 --> 02:34:48.100
something's going to happen.
Weird Shit would happen.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2695
02:34:48.490 --> 02:34:52.000
Especially if the dudes on trustworthy,
I mean,
especially if you're in space,

2696
02:34:52.001 --> 02:34:54.940
like you got no shot at getting back to civilization.

2697
02:34:55.150 --> 02:34:56.530
How many seasons did they do?

2698
02:34:56.910 --> 02:35:00.520
I have to a couple of years ago to realize this is where we going to live out

2699
02:35:00.521 --> 02:35:03.250
here on the moon for a fucking room.
Hundred Years.

2700
02:35:03.820 --> 02:35:08.740
This blows the kids.
They have to fucking listen to this guy.

2701
02:35:09.100 --> 02:35:13.180
They're falling around with them and they have to go back.
Dad,
Daddy's lion.
Yeah.

2702
02:35:14.080 --> 02:35:14.913
Yeah.

2703
02:35:15.410 --> 02:35:19.150
That might start banging him having like any,

2704
02:35:19.180 --> 02:35:24.180
any sort of person in that sort of a completely artificial way in your life.

2705
02:35:25.340 --> 02:35:29.360
Like you let them in.
It's like,
oh,
we're,
we're,
we,

2706
02:35:29.361 --> 02:35:32.170
we let in some weird shit like you've ever been up to Dan.
I know you have,

2707
02:35:32.200 --> 02:35:33.850
cause you,
you hang around with a bunch of idiots.

2708
02:35:34.360 --> 02:35:38.050
You ever been out to dinner with a guy and it's a rude thing to say,

2709
02:35:40.100 --> 02:35:41.770
listen,
you know,
I love you.
You're awesome.

2710
02:35:41.771 --> 02:35:43.790
But you hang around with fucking massive thing.

2711
02:35:43.791 --> 02:35:47.920
That's Dodos I've known Brian for so long that I know not to go over to his

2712
02:35:48.070 --> 02:35:51.780
house when he'll tell me like,
sir,
he's a good guy.
He just,
uh,
you know,

2713
02:35:51.790 --> 02:35:53.650
he's just a little weird or something.

2714
02:35:53.710 --> 02:35:58.660
And He'd come over his house for some party and you're talking next to some
loon,

2715
02:35:58.661 --> 02:36:02.980
like,
Oh God,
Brian,
what are you doing hanging out with this guy?
I know,
I know.

2716
02:36:02.981 --> 02:36:06.730
I know.
He wants to borrow money,
which should I tell him?
Tell him no,

2717
02:36:07.120 --> 02:36:08.170
the fuck you doing.

2718
02:36:08.410 --> 02:36:12.640
You'd always have like some new person you were hanging around with liquid waste

2719
02:36:12.641 --> 02:36:16.630
here in my life.
Do that producer,
producer guy that used to hang around with.

2720
02:36:16.780 --> 02:36:18.310
When I first started hanging around with Brian,

2721
02:36:18.460 --> 02:36:22.240
he had this producer guy that he hung around with and I remember like some guy

2722
02:36:22.241 --> 02:36:25.150
was like a writer who was trying to like make some things happen.
Meetings,

2723
02:36:25.151 --> 02:36:26.980
you don't need to name names.
You know what I'm talking about?

2724
02:36:27.390 --> 02:36:31.870
African American descent.
Oh yeah.
Complete total hustler and all boy.

2725
02:36:31.871 --> 02:36:33.550
And I was like,
wait,
what?

2726
02:36:34.220 --> 02:36:38.060
How did this guy get in this guys really close and I saw that.
Oh Man.

2727
02:36:39.160 --> 02:36:43.120
Kept hanging out with those around me.
You pitch shows with him.
He loved me.

2728
02:36:44.060 --> 02:36:48.130
He showed up drunk.
Yeah.
Drunk like,

2729
02:36:49.030 --> 02:36:51.760
well that guy was a,
he believed he was smart.

2730
02:36:52.120 --> 02:36:56.290
He believed he was like smart and slick and he was going to pull it off and he

2731
02:36:56.291 --> 02:37:01.291
believed like his smiles and his charm would mask the overall like slickster

2732
02:37:03.311 --> 02:37:06.790
hustler bullshit that he had underneath.
But there was,
there was no substance.

2733
02:37:06.791 --> 02:37:09.450
Like he would pitch ideas,
he'd be like,
what is this idea?

2734
02:37:09.470 --> 02:37:11.890
This dog shit idea you guys are going to go out with.

2735
02:37:12.250 --> 02:37:17.250
He was just was all like energy and he had found a way to integrate himself into

2736
02:37:17.631 --> 02:37:20.750
Hollywood,
you know?
And there's a bunch of those dudes,
man.

2737
02:37:21.050 --> 02:37:24.530
And he used to always have them around you.
Some of those people in Hollywood,

2738
02:37:25.040 --> 02:37:26.840
how many of those dudes did I tell you?
Dude,

2739
02:37:26.841 --> 02:37:29.900
you need to get the fuck away from those guys about how much time I would have

2740
02:37:29.901 --> 02:37:31.940
saved if I didn't get involved with those days.

2741
02:37:31.941 --> 02:37:34.070
But then I'd probably find other dudes,
you know what I mean?
Like,

2742
02:37:34.430 --> 02:37:38.620
like there would always be someone,
and I think it's a personality trait where I,

2743
02:37:38.650 --> 02:37:42.230
I would be pot I,
you know,
it's almost like if you're like me,

2744
02:37:42.231 --> 02:37:43.910
maybe because you moved around so much,

2745
02:37:44.180 --> 02:37:47.690
you make friends really quickly and you see the good only and then you just do

2746
02:37:47.691 --> 02:37:50.330
there to have a good time.
And then slowly you go,
oh wait,

2747
02:37:50.360 --> 02:37:54.970
you're a complete fucking,
you're a liar or whatever.
Yeah.
Well we have,

2748
02:37:55.100 --> 02:37:57.500
you have great.
I'd save so much time if I have your antenna.

2749
02:37:58.090 --> 02:38:02.000
I view or engineering when you were a genuine,
no,
my antenna's not flawless man.

2750
02:38:02.270 --> 02:38:04.280
There's a dude that slipped through the wire.

2751
02:38:04.310 --> 02:38:06.950
There's a couple people that slipped through the war that one of them was that

2752
02:38:06.951 --> 02:38:10.310
Raphael Tory guy.
I didn't really know him though.
I can't really,
I don't know,

2753
02:38:10.350 --> 02:38:13.310
was friends with uh,
Eddie Bravo and uh,

2754
02:38:13.370 --> 02:38:16.910
he turned out to be a fake Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt and he murdered some

2755
02:38:16.911 --> 02:38:20.360
guy.
He's in jail right now for murder.
He murdered some guy.

2756
02:38:20.361 --> 02:38:23.630
He was like banging the guy's wife and then like they had an insurance policy or

2757
02:38:23.631 --> 02:38:27.530
something and he killed the guy.
Yeah.
And was driving the guy's car.

2758
02:38:27.531 --> 02:38:30.380
There's some crazy shit was going on.
But when I met him,

2759
02:38:30.381 --> 02:38:32.120
he didn't seem like a murder to me.
Man.

2760
02:38:32.121 --> 02:38:37.121
He seemed pretty fucking normal and I didn't ever see him do martial arts,

2761
02:38:37.610 --> 02:38:40.370
so I couldn't see like,
whether it was bullshit or not,

2762
02:38:40.520 --> 02:38:43.130
I just met him at like a king of the cage event and talk to him.

2763
02:38:43.460 --> 02:38:46.970
But then you find out the guy's like a murderer and now he's in jail.
For what?

2764
02:38:47.300 --> 02:38:51.320
Yeah,
how was,
okay shit.
Maybe if I had a deal with them,

2765
02:38:51.590 --> 02:38:53.880
maybe I had something going on where w you know,

2766
02:38:53.960 --> 02:38:57.530
we were involved in something together.
Some business transaction or something.

2767
02:38:57.531 --> 02:39:00.320
Maybe I could have seen the bullshit pay,
but those guys are slick.

2768
02:39:00.350 --> 02:39:01.131
That's their job.

2769
02:39:01.131 --> 02:39:05.510
But he wasn't that slick because I did eventually watch a video long after Edie

2770
02:39:05.511 --> 02:39:08.770
had outed them it or told him like,
get the fuck out.

2771
02:39:08.780 --> 02:39:10.520
Eddie figured out that he wasn't really a black belt.

2772
02:39:10.720 --> 02:39:14.960
It was before Eddie was even a black belt and he was like purple belt or a brown

2773
02:39:14.961 --> 02:39:18.200
belt at the time.
It was before he beat Heuler.
It was long before that,

2774
02:39:18.560 --> 02:39:19.760
but we were um,

2775
02:39:20.270 --> 02:39:24.080
we were in the car once and Eddie fucking broke them down over the phone while

2776
02:39:24.081 --> 02:39:28.340
we were in the car.
Really?
Yeah.
The guy kept trying to hustle and,
and Diego,
stop,

2777
02:39:28.341 --> 02:39:32.600
stop,
stop.
Are you a black belt in Jujitsu?

2778
02:39:32.601 --> 02:39:35.360
I just need to hear this right now.
Are you a black belt in Jujitsu?

2779
02:39:35.750 --> 02:39:39.230
And there was this pause and he would start some other nonsense and this that,

2780
02:39:39.231 --> 02:39:41.630
well,
my dad learned Japanese.
You just stop,
stop,
stop.

2781
02:39:42.110 --> 02:39:46.250
Do you actually have a black belt in Jujitsu?
Not Your Dad,

2782
02:39:46.430 --> 02:39:47.360
not who you trained with.

2783
02:39:47.361 --> 02:39:50.600
[inaudible] and he went and there was like a silent moment and he goes,

2784
02:39:50.870 --> 02:39:55.430
I don't want to talk to you ever again.
Okay,
you're a bullshit artist like you,

2785
02:39:55.460 --> 02:39:59.720
you,
you made me,
I brought you around people you made me look bad.

2786
02:39:59.900 --> 02:40:03.140
Like you're not being honest.
You're not.
You're not honest person.

2787
02:40:03.500 --> 02:40:06.890
So after all that,
then I saw a video,
the dude working out,

2788
02:40:07.070 --> 02:40:09.770
I saw a video of him doing like a spinning back kick on a pad.

2789
02:40:09.980 --> 02:40:14.160
It's fucking comical.
I mean it's like someone showed him 20 minutes before.
Wow.

2790
02:40:14.190 --> 02:40:18.240
<v 0>Busy.
Ridiculously bad.
But he had a crazy story.
This guy,
he,</v>

2791
02:40:19.050 --> 02:40:22.350
he was such a hustler.
So it's a bullshit artist that he turned.

2792
02:40:22.980 --> 02:40:26.340
He turned up at,
he told this guy,

2793
02:40:26.550 --> 02:40:30.630
I need you to give me a ride in the woods.
I'm going to this no rules,
karate,

2794
02:40:30.631 --> 02:40:34.180
Kuma Tay and a,
I'm going to be gone for a couple of days.
So,
uh,

2795
02:40:34.200 --> 02:40:36.720
come back and get me a liquor on Saturday.

2796
02:40:37.440 --> 02:40:41.850
So he has his big duffle bag with them.
Okay.
Big fucking full duffle bag.

2797
02:40:41.990 --> 02:40:42.860
And he takes it with him.

2798
02:40:42.890 --> 02:40:46.170
He goes off this Cooma day and then the guy comes back on Saturday and now he's

2799
02:40:46.171 --> 02:40:50.100
holding a trophy.
How's it got?
Pick them up at the same spot.
He says,
yeah,

2800
02:40:50.101 --> 02:40:53.970
one that's tay and Pete,
everybody and nothing.
I got a trophy.
And the guy's like,

2801
02:40:53.971 --> 02:40:58.080
how you a fucking had a duffle bag that was filled with this fucking trophy?

2802
02:40:58.410 --> 02:41:01.950
<v 1>Oh No.
He told me to come get you in two days.</v>

2803
02:41:02.130 --> 02:41:06.480
So he probably would walked home,
took a nap,
aids and food,
went back up.

2804
02:41:06.510 --> 02:41:10.710
Wait for the dude to pick them up,
you know,
and yeah,
man,
a at the trophy I won.

2805
02:41:11.040 --> 02:41:14.550
You never know.
Like my buddy Mitch told me this crazy story.

2806
02:41:14.551 --> 02:41:17.790
He goes back to the high school reunion and one of the craziest today was his

2807
02:41:17.791 --> 02:41:22.470
guy Fitzy and Fitzy used it like he'd get on a car and you could drive 70 miles

2808
02:41:22.471 --> 02:41:25.230
an hour.
He's holding on it.
He was just crazy,
always the fun guy.

2809
02:41:25.470 --> 02:41:28.440
And he'd fight and get crazy.
So,
um,

2810
02:41:28.800 --> 02:41:33.420
and he was the sort of hometown,
crazy,
fun,
fucking nutty kid.

2811
02:41:33.421 --> 02:41:35.220
Good kid,
fun and crazy.

2812
02:41:35.700 --> 02:41:40.700
So Mitch goes back to his high school reunion in Tennessee and he says,

2813
02:41:40.981 --> 02:41:45.900
where the fuck is Fitzy?
And,
uh,
his cousin fits his cousin goes,
Ahh,

2814
02:41:45.930 --> 02:41:49.620
Bra.
It's a bad story,
man.
And he goes,
what do you mean he goes,
fits?
He's in jail,

2815
02:41:49.621 --> 02:41:53.010
man.
And he goes,
what are you fucking for?
What?
And he goes,
ah,

2816
02:41:53.011 --> 02:41:56.970
and everybody got weird.
And he goes,
it's just,
he's just there for a while and,

2817
02:41:56.971 --> 02:42:00.270
you know,
it's not coming out for a long time.
What the fuck did he do?
Well,

2818
02:42:00.271 --> 02:42:02.460
turns out Fitzy um,

2819
02:42:02.580 --> 02:42:07.580
kept going to Applebee's and there was a waiter there and he would,

2820
02:42:07.861 --> 02:42:10.560
the waiter would wait on them and Fitzy and he became friends.

2821
02:42:10.740 --> 02:42:12.120
And so one day fits.
He said,

2822
02:42:12.121 --> 02:42:14.400
let's go to the cornfields and smoke a joint and hang out.

2823
02:42:14.401 --> 02:42:18.330
And so we'll do joint and Fitz.
He tries to end,

2824
02:42:18.331 --> 02:42:23.220
does rape him and then tries to kill him after raping him.

2825
02:42:23.610 --> 02:42:26.250
A fight ensues.
A fight ensues.

2826
02:42:26.640 --> 02:42:29.770
Mr Applebee's runs through the Cornfield,

2827
02:42:29.820 --> 02:42:33.630
gets away and goes,
um,
the authorities please.

2828
02:42:33.690 --> 02:42:38.490
I was just a raped in attempt to murder.
They've tried,
tried to murder me.

2829
02:42:38.491 --> 02:42:41.790
He was all cut up and stuff and well,
it fits.
He's in jail now.

2830
02:42:41.850 --> 02:42:45.150
That's a weird thing.
Tried to fuck a guy.
Fucking kill a guy.

2831
02:42:45.360 --> 02:42:46.210
It's not what you're here.

2832
02:42:46.950 --> 02:42:50.670
And hung out with a guy for a long time at Applebee's and befriended them and

2833
02:42:50.671 --> 02:42:54.900
had actually planned the whole thing.
Oh my gosh.
So you never know,

2834
02:42:55.260 --> 02:42:59.880
gentlemen.
You never know how crazy somebody fucking is.
Yeah.

2835
02:42:59.910 --> 02:43:03.690
What the fuck?
The Fun Guy,
he's fun was the fun guy.

2836
02:43:03.740 --> 02:43:06.870
Hey buddies here.
He's got a rock.

2837
02:43:06.871 --> 02:43:10.790
He's got a belly flop off the high dive.
Ooh.
Ah,
yeah.

2838
02:43:11.240 --> 02:43:12.370
And now I'm going to fuck

2839
02:43:12.370 --> 02:43:15.670
<v 0>you.
Oh God.
Yeah.
Oh,</v>

2840
02:43:15.820 --> 02:43:19.990
so who knows?
We were fucking notes.
Yeah.

2841
02:43:20.110 --> 02:43:22.940
Those guys when he grow up to like,
you know,

2842
02:43:22.960 --> 02:43:26.080
you grow up in a neighborhood and it's like 50 dudes,
whatever,

2843
02:43:26.110 --> 02:43:28.240
that all kind of know each other like that.

2844
02:43:28.241 --> 02:43:33.241
The potential for one fucking unbelievably crazy person is so strong,

2845
02:43:34.630 --> 02:43:36.250
so strong,
especially if you're in the city.

2846
02:43:36.790 --> 02:43:39.940
Have you ever seen that video of the kid who does a back flip off the top of a

2847
02:43:39.941 --> 02:43:44.140
second story building?
No.
Yup.
Wild Kid in the street,

2848
02:43:44.141 --> 02:43:46.060
you know there's always those wild kids will try anything.

2849
02:43:46.090 --> 02:43:50.620
I have seen that this guy does and he makes it the first time it does it again.

2850
02:43:50.890 --> 02:43:53.650
Oh,
I didn't know about that.
Yeah.
The one that I've seen,

2851
02:43:53.651 --> 02:43:56.020
I've only seen one when a guy makes it and he's hanging out in a diner

2852
02:43:56.021 --> 02:43:58.930
afterwards and I was like,
how the fuck did you do that?
He backed,

2853
02:43:59.200 --> 02:44:03.540
backed this back to the edge and then just flipped.
Flipped to the air.

2854
02:44:03.560 --> 02:44:05.530
Land isn't collapse in the ground was fine.

2855
02:44:05.560 --> 02:44:08.370
It's one of the most incredible things.
It's the craziest Shit I've ever seen.

2856
02:44:08.380 --> 02:44:12.370
Did it for a zero?
Didn't do it for a nickel.
I mean,
maybe he had a bat,

2857
02:44:12.790 --> 02:44:16.510
but whatever.
I Dunno.
But it's the craziest thing I've ever,
I mean,

2858
02:44:16.750 --> 02:44:19.660
I remember that gone.
Oh,
that's the craziest thing.
I've seen that shit.

2859
02:44:19.750 --> 02:44:23.680
That's what happens when people grow up together and one guy pushes another guy

2860
02:44:23.681 --> 02:44:26.090
and the next thing you've got a steevo craziness.

2861
02:44:26.140 --> 02:44:30.400
The Hawk like Steevo like you got some crazy funny.
Knoxville is the most gnarly.

2862
02:44:30.430 --> 02:44:34.120
They're all crazy.
They're all crazy.
But look,
Steve O was with lions.

2863
02:44:34.240 --> 02:44:37.300
He climbed a fucking tree and the lions came up the tree and their swat and they

2864
02:44:37.301 --> 02:44:41.260
took his hat from him that is talked about that.

2865
02:44:41.290 --> 02:44:44.470
And that was a commercial he was doing.
And he said,
do they climb trees now?

2866
02:44:44.480 --> 02:44:46.960
Don't worry,
they don't climb trees.
And when Steve was up there,

2867
02:44:47.290 --> 02:44:49.960
the lion climbed up the tree and got on Tom and Steve as well,

2868
02:44:49.961 --> 02:44:54.160
I'm going to die now.
And the trainer took a raw chicken and wave to that day,

2869
02:44:54.280 --> 02:44:56.920
Lyon and got him away.
But Steve would tell us,
tell the story.

2870
02:44:57.400 --> 02:45:00.940
Whereas Johnny Knoxville will blindfold himself with a cigarette in his mouth

2871
02:45:00.941 --> 02:45:05.380
and allow a bowl to run through him.
I saw that.
Oh,
I haven't seen this one.

2872
02:45:05.440 --> 02:45:10.270
Is this another kid?
Five story.
No fluff into a pool.
Oh,

2873
02:45:10.271 --> 02:45:13.430
no way.
Why do I not want to see this?
I don't either.

2874
02:45:13.431 --> 02:45:17.720
It makes me so nervous because you're going to die.
It's on any bomb thrower.

2875
02:45:17.890 --> 02:45:22.700
This,
oh my God.
Oh my God.
That's,

2876
02:45:22.720 --> 02:45:27.190
that's a bad motherfucker.
Oh my God.
That's a bad motherfucker.

2877
02:45:27.290 --> 02:45:31.330
Oh my God.
Please don't do that at home you guys.
Please don't do that.
Anybody.

2878
02:45:31.750 --> 02:45:34.940
Maybe I'm,
please don't do that.
It's crazy.

2879
02:45:37.720 --> 02:45:42.070
What is it feel like when he was in the air,
like what have I done?
I don't know.

2880
02:45:43.060 --> 02:45:48.060
Imagine what that felt like on his balls because your feet hit and then you're,

2881
02:45:48.550 --> 02:45:53.020
what's funny is he's not in the air for that.
Bob.
So crazy.
Like how,
how,

2882
02:45:53.080 --> 02:45:56.730
how fast you fall.
Like do it again.
How many seconds was he in the,

2883
02:45:57.220 --> 02:45:58.720
not very long.
Don't much.

2884
02:46:02.130 --> 02:46:03.420
Your voice just got high again.

2885
02:46:03.950 --> 02:46:08.350
I do too scared when I used to do the fear factor stunts in the real look,

2886
02:46:08.360 --> 02:46:10.730
looking over the edge of some of the buildings these people had to crawl out on.

2887
02:46:10.731 --> 02:46:14.420
I'm like,
oh,
is this another one?
Oh No,
dude,
what is this now?

2888
02:46:15.350 --> 02:46:19.400
Oh No,
stop it.
Oh my God,

2889
02:46:19.401 --> 02:46:23.870
this guy's going to climb or he's going to swing.
This is not good.
I don't know,

2890
02:46:23.871 --> 02:46:28.790
man.
I'm still thinking.
I want to see this.
Well,
I do now.
Um,
why?

2891
02:46:28.791 --> 02:46:32.720
What's wrong with you?
Because so it's not even in another country.

2892
02:46:32.750 --> 02:46:36.080
You got to push yourself as a different language.
Die For sure.

2893
02:46:39.970 --> 02:46:40.970
<v 4>Why are you doing?</v>

2894
02:46:41.980 --> 02:46:44.800
<v 0>Oh my God.
Oh my God.</v>

2895
02:46:46.780 --> 02:46:49.320
Look at this again.
What's the image?

2896
02:46:51.880 --> 02:46:54.190
<v 4>Oh No,
no,
no,
no.</v>

2897
02:46:54.270 --> 02:46:57.810
<v 0>So crazy.
He barely,
barely made it.
Look at that.</v>

2898
02:46:58.080 --> 02:47:00.900
What a jump though.
That's insane.

2899
02:47:02.680 --> 02:47:05.790
He missed by like,
uh,
I mean,
I don't even want to see any cheese.

2900
02:47:05.890 --> 02:47:08.740
He would've smashed his knees apart.
I had trouble sleeping with that.

2901
02:47:10.490 --> 02:47:12.010
Do you know that's an interesting thing.

2902
02:47:12.011 --> 02:47:15.850
There was a study on why men do that and they were trying to figure out what it

2903
02:47:15.851 --> 02:47:19.720
is about men that makes them want to do like ridiculous stunts like that.

2904
02:47:19.990 --> 02:47:21.700
And they said that when men do that,

2905
02:47:21.701 --> 02:47:26.020
it makes them more sexually attractive to females.

2906
02:47:26.021 --> 02:47:30.010
There's certain females that are attracted to men that don't have fear though,

2907
02:47:30.011 --> 02:47:35.011
or willing to overcome fear and that it's somehow or another they think in some

2908
02:47:35.771 --> 02:47:39.340
way connected to the idea of a brave warrior.

2909
02:47:39.580 --> 02:47:43.960
Cause a brave warrior faces something that everyone else is terrified but faces

2910
02:47:43.961 --> 02:47:44.794
it head on.

2911
02:47:45.040 --> 02:47:49.600
And that same sort of like reaction to watching someone do something that you

2912
02:47:49.601 --> 02:47:52.360
know as a person is absolutely terrified when they see it.

2913
02:47:52.750 --> 02:47:55.840
It gets them turned on.
I get it.
Makes total sense to me.

2914
02:47:56.710 --> 02:48:01.000
I think that's just a misplacement of energy.
I mean that guy would have been,

2915
02:48:01.060 --> 02:48:05.770
you know,
okay,
that's a misplacement but isn't that essentially,

2916
02:48:05.800 --> 02:48:06.820
I'm just saying that that,

2917
02:48:06.821 --> 02:48:09.820
that he is back in the day he probably would have been with a shield and

2918
02:48:09.821 --> 02:48:12.000
charging into battle.
That's what I mean.
Well,
I mean,
isn't it?

2919
02:48:12.040 --> 02:48:12.880
What I was saying is,

2920
02:48:12.881 --> 02:48:16.780
isn't it essentially the same thing that makes someone like a crazy BMX rider?

2921
02:48:17.100 --> 02:48:21.250
You do those flips.
Yeah,
man.
That's kind of the same thing.
It's just,

2922
02:48:21.251 --> 02:48:24.640
it's also pushing yourself beyond what you think you can do,
but you know,

2923
02:48:24.700 --> 02:48:29.610
but the BMX guy gets money.
If your BMX guy and you,

2924
02:48:29.611 --> 02:48:32.720
you do flips and shit and you're awesome at it,
you can make a lot of money.

2925
02:48:32.780 --> 02:48:36.200
I also think it's juice.
It's also dry adrenaline.
Look,
man,

2926
02:48:36.410 --> 02:48:39.590
getting into a ring every day and fight and do is where you might get knocked

2927
02:48:39.591 --> 02:48:43.730
out.
That's,
that's pretty daredevily as well.
That's pretty scary too.
Oh No,

2928
02:48:43.731 --> 02:48:48.080
no running ponds back in the NFL.
Fucking scary.
Yeah.
Any of that shit.
You know,

2929
02:48:48.081 --> 02:48:51.200
something about that is leak.
You like when you're fighting,

2930
02:48:51.201 --> 02:48:54.970
at least you're under your own sort of control in some sort of a way.
Yeah,

2931
02:48:54.980 --> 02:48:58.400
you have to deal with somebody else,
but if you know what the fuck you're doing,

2932
02:48:58.401 --> 02:49:02.010
you can kind of mitigate a lot of shit,
sort of.
You at least you hope you can.

2933
02:49:02.030 --> 02:49:05.600
That's the ultimate goal.
But man,
when you're fucking doing flips off a mountain,

2934
02:49:06.390 --> 02:49:11.070
going off a mountain or a mountain bike,
I
wish,
wish,

2935
02:49:11.071 --> 02:49:13.020
wish,
Bam,
and then your landing,

2936
02:49:13.320 --> 02:49:16.170
some of those guys are out of their fucking mind.

2937
02:49:16.200 --> 02:49:20.160
I think you get addicted to the adrenaline to 100% yeah,
the most.
I mean,

2938
02:49:20.161 --> 02:49:22.860
if I didn't perform,
I would die.
Yeah.

2939
02:49:22.861 --> 02:49:25.410
But I think it's a way crazier rush that they get.

2940
02:49:25.650 --> 02:49:29.720
They're doing like two flips on TV and landing on a bike.
They do motorcycles,

2941
02:49:29.740 --> 02:49:32.250
they flip through the air on a motorcycle.
But then what happens?

2942
02:49:32.700 --> 02:49:34.840
What happens when that goes away?
You know?
Well,

2943
02:49:34.890 --> 02:49:39.320
what happens when it lands on their body?
That's a horrible to watch.
Well,

2944
02:49:39.630 --> 02:49:43.820
Jason Ellis,
Jason Ellis still has to do crazy shit.
You got in the ring with,

2945
02:49:43.830 --> 02:49:46.640
with Keith Jardine the other day and he just putting a mouthpiece,

2946
02:49:46.650 --> 02:49:48.300
no headgear and goes,
let's just slug it out.

2947
02:49:48.630 --> 02:49:51.390
And he starts going at it with Giardia and Giardia and just cause all right.

2948
02:49:51.391 --> 02:49:54.030
You know what?
Bang,
just catches him with an uppercut,
knocks him out.

2949
02:49:54.031 --> 02:49:58.230
Jason was like,
it was fucking awesome.
He just needs the juice.
I was like,

2950
02:49:58.231 --> 02:50:01.950
but that's Chardyna hit you and knocked you out.
That's not good for your brain.

2951
02:50:02.210 --> 02:50:05.910
He's been,
he's been shut off a bunch of times too.
Yeah.

2952
02:50:06.150 --> 02:50:10.170
I asked him about that once and he said he's been alcohol like six times and

2953
02:50:10.171 --> 02:50:12.360
that was black.
I think there was like from skateboarding,

2954
02:50:12.510 --> 02:50:16.140
I don't even think that was from fighting.
I know he loves doing it.
Sturdy Dude,

2955
02:50:16.141 --> 02:50:19.020
man.
Yeah,
but that causes depression.

2956
02:50:19.740 --> 02:50:22.350
Like too much head trauma like that.
Yeah.
That causes,

2957
02:50:22.351 --> 02:50:25.090
that causes you to route do like shit.

2958
02:50:25.160 --> 02:50:28.770
You Claire shooting themselves in the chest so that you can study their brain

2959
02:50:28.771 --> 02:50:32.750
because they knew something was wrong.
Mark Gordon,
I'm the guy,
uh,

2960
02:50:32.910 --> 02:50:36.690
who's the expert in traumatic brain injury.
Dr. Mark Gordon,
he,
um,

2961
02:50:36.720 --> 02:50:39.330
he said it doesn't take much and he said,

2962
02:50:39.390 --> 02:50:42.660
you could have one wrong car accident where you don't even get injured.

2963
02:50:42.780 --> 02:50:46.050
You just slammed forward and like hit the steering wheel.
Like,
you're fine.

2964
02:50:46.080 --> 02:50:47.410
Everybody's fine,
everybody's fine.
You know,

2965
02:50:47.430 --> 02:50:49.680
a little fender bender and you're fucked.
You're fucked.

2966
02:50:49.681 --> 02:50:51.090
You're depressed for months.

2967
02:50:51.120 --> 02:50:54.960
You don't know why your pituitary gland just not functioning properly.

2968
02:50:54.990 --> 02:50:55.381
Like you're,

2969
02:50:55.381 --> 02:50:59.370
you're bringing so by a lot of people with brain injury go on hormone therapy

2970
02:50:59.820 --> 02:51:03.090
because their body starts producing testosterone and that stuff.
Yeah,

2971
02:51:03.091 --> 02:51:04.590
well there's a bunch of shit.
The,

2972
02:51:04.670 --> 02:51:08.940
your dopamine levels drop your serotonin levels drop your human growth hormone

2973
02:51:08.941 --> 02:51:10.650
levels drop,
you get tired.
You know,

2974
02:51:10.651 --> 02:51:14.040
they think that that's a lot of what they used to call chronic fatigue syndrome

2975
02:51:14.240 --> 02:51:16.560
to chronic fatigue syndrome.

2976
02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:19.050
They attribute to a couple of different possibilities.

2977
02:51:19.051 --> 02:51:21.900
One of them has Lyme disease.
They didn't understand the Lyme disease.
Well,

2978
02:51:21.901 --> 02:51:22.500
I'm disease.

2979
02:51:22.500 --> 02:51:26.360
They believe I didn't start diagnosing people with Lyme disease to like the

2980
02:51:26.370 --> 02:51:29.730
fucking eighties or something like that.
It was fairly recent disease.
Um,

2981
02:51:30.030 --> 02:51:30.811
but the other one,

2982
02:51:30.811 --> 02:51:34.380
they think it might have been depression and head trauma where they just don't

2983
02:51:34.381 --> 02:51:36.030
want to get out of bed.
Like that's,

2984
02:51:36.031 --> 02:51:38.400
remember that when they used to call it chronic fatigue syndrome,

2985
02:51:39.060 --> 02:51:41.720
it was called up.
I mean,
they had different words for it,
but you know,

2986
02:51:41.730 --> 02:51:44.130
was like a Epstein Barr virus.

2987
02:51:44.760 --> 02:51:49.200
My roommate in college had that for like a year.
Yeah.
It's just,
you know,
had to,

2988
02:51:49.830 --> 02:51:53.610
I remember there was some girl that,
um,
I didn't know,

2989
02:51:53.611 --> 02:51:56.790
but I knew her like peripherally and someone was like,
yeah,
poor girl,

2990
02:51:56.791 --> 02:52:00.540
she's got chronic fatigue syndrome.
I'm like,
what the fuck is that?
And I think,

2991
02:52:00.780 --> 02:52:03.450
yeah,
I don't know if she had been a car accident or something,

2992
02:52:03.451 --> 02:52:06.820
but if I want to say she was,
it's like a serious car accident.

2993
02:52:07.450 --> 02:52:09.950
I'm trying to remember.
I'm trying to remember.
It's too,
it's too long ago.

2994
02:52:09.951 --> 02:52:10.960
I might be confusing stories,

2995
02:52:10.961 --> 02:52:15.100
but I remember thinking like I had met her before and she seemed normal and now

2996
02:52:15.101 --> 02:52:17.860
here she is.
What?
She doesn't have any energy to do anything.

2997
02:52:17.861 --> 02:52:20.050
When you have somebody who's breakdown,

2998
02:52:20.051 --> 02:52:22.570
like just what one Oregon does and then how it,

2999
02:52:22.630 --> 02:52:24.130
how it works with all the other organs.

3000
02:52:24.131 --> 02:52:27.580
Sometimes you can't believe that shit doesn't break down more.
Yeah.

3001
02:52:27.660 --> 02:52:30.970
It's like it's just such an intricate machine and one thing is dependent on the

3002
02:52:30.971 --> 02:52:31.241
other.

3003
02:52:31.241 --> 02:52:34.900
It's fucking nuts where somebody will have a cavity and issue with their tooth

3004
02:52:35.080 --> 02:52:39.460
and they have unexplained foot pain and all of a sudden they realized that the

3005
02:52:39.490 --> 02:52:44.020
nerve in the tooth is connected to the nerve in the foot.

3006
02:52:44.021 --> 02:52:45.970
And so what was really causing the problem,

3007
02:52:45.971 --> 02:52:49.790
the pain in your foot was not your foot.
It was what was your,

3008
02:52:49.840 --> 02:52:52.900
it was your tooth like an infection.
Infection.
There's a,

3009
02:52:52.930 --> 02:52:56.590
there's a certain nerve that goes from,
from like the jaw all the way down.

3010
02:52:56.640 --> 02:52:59.200
You know,
people get fucking heart attacks for tooth infections.
Yes.

3011
02:52:59.260 --> 02:53:03.980
It caused the artery.
The bacteria corrodes the arteries.
Crows,

3012
02:53:04.010 --> 02:53:06.400
the crows,
the valves.
Yeah.
It's fucking,
you know,

3013
02:53:07.210 --> 02:53:11.170
that's why there's a bullet thing is so fucking frightening because anything

3014
02:53:11.171 --> 02:53:14.410
that just to mediafly shuts your body down.

3015
02:53:14.440 --> 02:53:16.960
Anything that immediately puts your body into a tailspin.

3016
02:53:16.990 --> 02:53:20.740
50% of the people that catch this shit die.
Yeah.
Yeah.

3017
02:53:20.770 --> 02:53:24.460
It's so weird when something just goes wrong.
Like everything's great today.

3018
02:53:24.640 --> 02:53:28.720
Today.
What did I do?
Wow.
I went and walked the dogs.
I,
uh,
I got up,

3019
02:53:28.721 --> 02:53:31.870
I play with my kid.
I bumped up a bow or went and played tennis.

3020
02:53:32.170 --> 02:53:36.700
What happened yesterday?
Oh,
you know,
same thing.
What happens tomorrow?
Ebola.
Yeah.

3021
02:53:37.050 --> 02:53:41.050
See it.
Boom.
Magic virus boils all over your face.

3022
02:53:41.060 --> 02:53:45.080
Your face is covered in a giant fucking cell phone size plus

3023
02:53:46.730 --> 02:53:47.250
fine

3024
02:53:47.250 --> 02:53:49.590
<v 1>crying out of your eyes.
It's like seeing,
um,</v>

3025
02:53:49.770 --> 02:53:52.680
that woman who went jogging and Florida and she was,
you know,

3026
02:53:52.681 --> 02:53:54.750
it was like seven at night and she had a long day at work.

3027
02:53:54.751 --> 02:53:57.420
She went right and she's just dangled a feed off the bridge.

3028
02:53:57.870 --> 02:53:59.620
I just got to dangle my feet.
I'm just fucking hot.

3029
02:54:00.090 --> 02:54:02.910
And an 11 foot alligator was like,
I'm going to,
I'll take you now.

3030
02:54:02.940 --> 02:54:06.900
I'll be having you now.
Oh,
they found it with no arms.

3031
02:54:07.290 --> 02:54:10.530
Took her arms.
Fuck.
That's good time.
Alligator was like,

3032
02:54:10.531 --> 02:54:13.650
I know I'm an alligator and usually I don't do this cause the crocodiles do it.

3033
02:54:13.860 --> 02:54:17.370
I'm going to do it today to you.
You're going to be,
uh,
the third,

3034
02:54:17.400 --> 02:54:20.490
only three people or four people of the year that's going to be eaten by a

3035
02:54:20.500 --> 02:54:22.950
fucking 11 foot dragon.
That'll be me.

3036
02:54:23.120 --> 02:54:24.590
<v 0>You the weird that alligators,</v>

3037
02:54:24.591 --> 02:54:27.260
they let them hang around because they're not too aggressive.

3038
02:54:27.530 --> 02:54:32.270
It's like they're just docile and usually run from you that people don't just

3039
02:54:32.271 --> 02:54:33.700
decide to fucking kill them onsite.

3040
02:54:33.720 --> 02:54:37.730
But really everyone in Florida should be in up in arms.

3041
02:54:37.850 --> 02:54:41.360
They should run out to the swamps and gun those fucking dinosaurs down.

3042
02:54:41.590 --> 02:54:45.380
Like those are a bunch of kid eating dog eating monster shit out of dogs.

3043
02:54:45.530 --> 02:54:49.070
And a guy was walking his dog and they all get it.
Didn't go for the dog.

3044
02:54:49.071 --> 02:54:52.790
Went for the guy.
Took the guy's fucking Jesus.
Yeah.

3045
02:54:52.820 --> 02:54:55.280
They're just not as aggressive as crocs.
If they were crocs,

3046
02:54:55.281 --> 02:54:58.220
we wouldn't be killing them.
Left slide crocodiles,

3047
02:54:58.310 --> 02:55:01.250
they found Nile crocs in the everglades.
Stop it.
Yes,
they have.

3048
02:55:01.280 --> 02:55:05.930
There's a shoot on order for Nile Crocodile.
People used to have them as pets.

3049
02:55:06.580 --> 02:55:09.050
Nile crocodiles,
they don't know if they're breeding.

3050
02:55:09.110 --> 02:55:10.250
They don't don't have any idea,

3051
02:55:10.251 --> 02:55:13.670
but their spot in more than one Nile crocodile in the everglades confirmed

3052
02:55:13.671 --> 02:55:17.420
sightings.
They're saying straight up killers.
Yep.
If you see them,

3053
02:55:17.480 --> 02:55:20.240
they kill him onsite.
Straight up come,
they will come right at you.

3054
02:55:20.241 --> 02:55:23.480
You are food as a human being.
Oh,
they get really big.

3055
02:55:23.560 --> 02:55:26.900
That peace corps girl who was like,
oh they were in Kenya.
Well,

3056
02:55:26.901 --> 02:55:30.350
the crocodiles died out,
uh,
years ago.
She heard,
she heard,

3057
02:55:31.220 --> 02:55:34.220
she goes swimming.
The guy's like,
I don't know.
She's like,

3058
02:55:34.221 --> 02:55:35.900
I'm going in with a value.
I'm a water baby.

3059
02:55:36.080 --> 02:55:39.200
30 seconds later it's pulled on a cloud.
Got My feet.

3060
02:55:41.270 --> 02:55:44.720
There was a document or an article I was reading about these people that were

3061
02:55:44.721 --> 02:55:48.350
canoeing in the Congo and the guy behind washes,

3062
02:55:48.351 --> 02:55:51.380
the guy in front gets taken by the crock with a Croc,

3063
02:55:51.381 --> 02:55:56.210
just rises up out of the water and literally snatches the guy and spins the

3064
02:55:56.211 --> 02:55:57.710
canoe upside kayak rather.

3065
02:55:57.970 --> 02:56:02.970
[inaudible] stuck in it and it like goes up and down like a bobber and then pump

3066
02:56:04.160 --> 02:56:07.850
and then pops up.
No Guy,
that's it.
He doesn't see the guy over again.

3067
02:56:08.500 --> 02:56:10.370
The CROC just takes them out of the water.

3068
02:56:10.910 --> 02:56:14.780
And just so the motto of that story is don't fucking Kayak in denial.

3069
02:56:15.350 --> 02:56:19.910
I mean in,
in the Congo it don't do that.
That would be the motto of that story.

3070
02:56:19.970 --> 02:56:24.170
Oh,
fucking are you out of your fucking mind?
They're not like sharks.

3071
02:56:24.200 --> 02:56:27.420
They will bother you.
They come after you come after everything.
Yeah.

3072
02:56:27.440 --> 02:56:30.790
That's what they're,
they're here for cleanup.
Ologists sit in Uganda.
He saw,

3073
02:56:30.800 --> 02:56:35.000
saw what a crock.
I'll eat a god damn tire.
Eat a whole tire.
I was like,

3074
02:56:35.001 --> 02:56:39.380
I'm going to heat this tire.
I was like,
can you repeat that again?
He goes,

3075
02:56:39.381 --> 02:56:44.330
it ain't a tire.
Cartera cause yet eight.
Oh my God.
So your your food.

3076
02:56:44.470 --> 02:56:47.000
Yeah,
they eat everything.
That's tee shirt,
everything.

3077
02:56:47.030 --> 02:56:49.580
If you think about it like where are they?
Well,

3078
02:56:49.581 --> 02:56:54.581
they live in a place that's so rich with life and they have to be consistent in

3079
02:56:55.311 --> 02:56:59.500
their ability to kill it like that.
Did a cleanups anytime.

3080
02:56:59.750 --> 02:57:01.070
Just too many water buffaloes.

3081
02:57:01.071 --> 02:57:04.790
There's too many wildebeests when there's too many Willdabeast they'd go near

3082
02:57:04.791 --> 02:57:08.330
the waterhole and they get [inaudible].
They get snatched it.
Right.
But you know,

3083
02:57:08.331 --> 02:57:09.290
it doesn't get snatched.

3084
02:57:09.860 --> 02:57:14.400
Hippos crocs don't fuck with absolutely that.

3085
02:57:14.450 --> 02:57:19.130
All hallows Wade into the water with crocs and swim right by him.

3086
02:57:19.131 --> 02:57:23.870
It's the most amazing thing to say because hippos are so fucking violent.

3087
02:57:23.930 --> 02:57:28.160
They're like,
go fuck yourself.
They break crocs in half.
They cut crocs in half.

3088
02:57:28.180 --> 02:57:32.690
Yeah.
Yeah.
We're at a time.
