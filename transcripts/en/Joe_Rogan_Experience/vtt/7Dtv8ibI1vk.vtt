1
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:02.393
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here we go.</v>

2
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:04.860
<v Speaker 1>Four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

3
00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.670
<v Speaker 1>two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hello Bill.</v>

4
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.930
<v Speaker 1>Hi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on man?</v>

5
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.360
<v Speaker 1>I am very excited to be here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm excited to have you here.</v>

6
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.280
<v Speaker 1>Excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The social leap.</v>

7
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.780
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the social leap?</v>

8
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.090
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you all about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Please do.</v>

9
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.020
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

10
00:00:19.021 --> 00:00:19.854
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the story that I want to tell is </v>

11
00:00:21.361 --> 00:00:23.730
<v Speaker 1>basically how we got here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are we became human?</v>

12
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.133
<v Speaker 1>And so that story begins about six or 7 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million years ago when our ancestors </v>

13
00:00:29.641 --> 00:00:30.474
<v Speaker 1>left the rain forest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the question is why would they </v>

14
00:00:33.061 --> 00:00:35.400
<v Speaker 1>leave and how would they survive once </v>
<v Speaker 1>they left?</v>

15
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:36.990
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what the social leap.</v>

16
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.570
<v Speaker 1>So it takes a second to get it all out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

17
00:00:39.571 --> 00:00:40.840
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

18
00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.480
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's the story.</v>

19
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.960
<v Speaker 1>So if you look back about 7 million </v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

20
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.093
<v Speaker 1>our ancestors and chimps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had a common ancestor at about that </v>

21
00:00:49.531 --> 00:00:51.450
<v Speaker 1>point in time six or 7 million years </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>

22
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:52.793
<v Speaker 1>and that common ancestor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't know exactly what it looked </v>

23
00:00:54.451 --> 00:00:56.550
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was from all we can tell,</v>

24
00:00:56.551 --> 00:00:59.580
<v Speaker 1>it was awfully close to today's chimps </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so there,</v>

25
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.503
<v Speaker 1>if you look at chimps today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get a pretty good sense of what </v>

26
00:01:01.921 --> 00:01:02.820
<v Speaker 1>life was like then.</v>

27
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.330
<v Speaker 1>And chimps today are really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're basically at the top of the food</v>

28
00:01:06.331 --> 00:01:10.580
<v Speaker 1>chain in the rain forest there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super fast up in the trees,</v>

29
00:01:10.581 --> 00:01:13.250
<v Speaker 1>super athletic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they.</v>

30
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.260
<v Speaker 1>Because they travel in groups,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even amazing tree climbers like leopards</v>

31
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.620
<v Speaker 1>won't try to attack them in trees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just they're too dangerous,</v>

32
00:01:19.621 --> 00:01:20.454
<v Speaker 1>too fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you look at a chimp on the </v>

33
00:01:21.841 --> 00:01:23.130
<v Speaker 1>ground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can't even lock.</v>

34
00:01:23.131 --> 00:01:25.580
<v Speaker 1>It's nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of cute little stumbling along</v>

35
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.423
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the question is why would an </v>

36
00:01:27.901 --> 00:01:28.734
<v Speaker 1>animal that runs the show in the canopy </v>
<v Speaker 1>leave the rain forest for the Savannah </v>

37
00:01:31.831 --> 00:01:34.680
<v Speaker 1>and then how it survived.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once I did that and that's.</v>

38
00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:35.643
<v Speaker 1>That's the story of this book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then how that manifests itself to </v>

39
00:01:37.651 --> 00:01:40.830
<v Speaker 1>where we are today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So really my goal,</v>

40
00:01:40.831 --> 00:01:41.664
<v Speaker 1>I'm a psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to understand why we are the way </v>

41
00:01:43.351 --> 00:01:45.990
<v Speaker 1>we are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so in trying to figure that out,</v>

42
00:01:45.991 --> 00:01:46.381
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

43
00:01:46.381 --> 00:01:47.214
<v Speaker 1>let's take a look back all the way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>our common ancestors and seed some of </v>

44
00:01:50.461 --> 00:01:53.460
<v Speaker 1>the key events and how they might've had</v>
<v Speaker 1>an influence on how we are today.</v>

45
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.940
<v Speaker 1>So the first question is why would we </v>
<v Speaker 1>leave the trees right here we are,</v>

46
00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.570
<v Speaker 1>we're dominant position where we're food</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the ground.</v>

47
00:02:00.571 --> 00:02:01.404
<v Speaker 1>Why would we ever take that risk?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the basic story there is the great </v>

48
00:02:04.621 --> 00:02:05.454
<v Speaker 1>African Rift Valley,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure if you're familiar with </v>

49
00:02:07.081 --> 00:02:07.914
<v Speaker 1>that at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but basically it runs down from up at </v>

50
00:02:10.321 --> 00:02:12.630
<v Speaker 1>the Red Sea down to the coast of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mozambique.</v>

51
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.090
<v Speaker 1>And you can think of it like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>geographic zipper.</v>

52
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.373
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the world's sits on these tectonic </v>

53
00:02:17.311 --> 00:02:20.010
<v Speaker 1>plates and sometimes they crash into </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other like,</v>

54
00:02:20.011 --> 00:02:20.844
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how Indians smashing into Asia and </v>

55
00:02:22.111 --> 00:02:22.944
<v Speaker 1>creates amylase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they literally tear apart and </v>

56
00:02:25.381 --> 00:02:27.840
<v Speaker 1>Africa's tearing apart at the great </v>
<v Speaker 1>African Rift Valley.</v>

57
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.150
<v Speaker 1>So that plate that has Somalia and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ethiopia,</v>

58
00:02:30.151 --> 00:02:31.230
<v Speaker 1>Tanzania,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kenya,</v>

59
00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:32.423
<v Speaker 1>that's moving off to the lower right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest of Africa is moving off to the </v>

60
00:02:35.101 --> 00:02:40.101
<v Speaker 1>upper left and I got no idea why it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>been going on for quite a while,</v>

61
00:02:40.381 --> 00:02:41.214
<v Speaker 1>but one of the consequences that is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the east Africa starting to rise up </v>

62
00:02:44.131 --> 00:02:44.964
<v Speaker 1>slowly bit by bit and when it rises up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rainforest dry out and so basically </v>

63
00:02:49.501 --> 00:02:50.334
<v Speaker 1>what you have is a situation where our </v>
<v Speaker 1>ancestors were on the east side of that </v>

64
00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.903
<v Speaker 1>Rift Valley and it started to dry out </v>
<v Speaker 1>and now they're in a situation where </v>

65
00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.040
<v Speaker 1>they've got this great lifestyle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their dominant position,</v>

66
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.060
<v Speaker 1>but now they're pushed.</v>

67
00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.893
<v Speaker 1>They're forced out onto the ground </v>
<v Speaker 1>increasingly more and more because </v>

68
00:03:02.711 --> 00:03:05.260
<v Speaker 1>there's more and more ground and less </v>
<v Speaker 1>and less rain forest.</v>

69
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:06.423
<v Speaker 1>And so how do they survive that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do they do in order to make that </v>

70
00:03:09.551 --> 00:03:12.010
<v Speaker 1>work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is a what,</v>

71
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.560
<v Speaker 1>what period of time is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many millions of years ago,</v>

72
00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.450
<v Speaker 1>six or seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six or seven.</v>

73
00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:17.493
<v Speaker 1>Does this coincide with the when?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When was the jump of the human brain </v>

74
00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:22.534
<v Speaker 1>size?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're doubling.</v>

75
00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:23.533
<v Speaker 1>We'll get to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a super interesting question </v>

76
00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:25.954
<v Speaker 1>about why that happened as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So basically if you track us across the </v>

77
00:03:28.481 --> 00:03:29.314
<v Speaker 1>next 3 million years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did our ancestors survive when </v>

78
00:03:31.721 --> 00:03:32.554
<v Speaker 1>they're basically chimpanzees on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>open savannah and you can get a hint of </v>

79
00:03:35.981 --> 00:03:36.814
<v Speaker 1>how they did it because there's one </v>
<v Speaker 1>chimpanzee group that does live on the </v>

80
00:03:38.711 --> 00:03:39.544
<v Speaker 1>Savannah in Senegal and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they show some differences between </v>

81
00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.060
<v Speaker 1>themselves and other chimps that </v>
<v Speaker 1>traveling slightly larger groups.</v>

82
00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.180
<v Speaker 1>They share more nicely with each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is interesting.</v>

83
00:03:49.181 --> 00:03:51.570
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of a human trait as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

84
00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:52.483
<v Speaker 1>they also avoid open space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they're just kind trying to stay </v>

85
00:03:54.701 --> 00:03:57.190
<v Speaker 1>near the trees as much as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

86
00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:59.920
<v Speaker 1>and if you look at other eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not aids,</v>

87
00:03:59.921 --> 00:04:02.050
<v Speaker 1>but other primates that are on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Savannah,</v>

88
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:03.190
<v Speaker 1>Savannah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>baboons,</v>

89
00:04:03.191 --> 00:04:04.024
<v Speaker 1>they're only monkey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're not as sharp as chimpanzees </v>

90
00:04:05.921 --> 00:04:07.600
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they have a similar strategy,</v>

91
00:04:07.601 --> 00:04:08.434
<v Speaker 1>large groups to try to protect </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves and lots of eyes to look out </v>

92
00:04:10.751 --> 00:04:13.180
<v Speaker 1>for predators.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they do fine on the savannah.</v>

93
00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.020
<v Speaker 1>And so what I suspect happened is for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the first few million years,</v>

94
00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:18.063
<v Speaker 1>basically what you've got is this chimp </v>
<v Speaker 1>like animal that's kind of skirting the </v>

95
00:04:21.071 --> 00:04:21.904
<v Speaker 1>edges of Savannah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nowhere near the top dominant position </v>

96
00:04:23.591 --> 00:04:25.930
<v Speaker 1>they used to be and just kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>noodling around.</v>

97
00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:27.790
<v Speaker 1>And that takes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suspect,</v>

98
00:04:27.791 --> 00:04:30.610
<v Speaker 1>that takes us for about the first three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three and a half million years.</v>

99
00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:35.050
<v Speaker 1>And if you look at who we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we're Australopithecus afarensis.</v>

100
00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.030
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you looked at one of them,</v>

101
00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.330
<v Speaker 1>you'd think it belongs in a zoo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks almost like a chimpanzee.</v>

102
00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.710
<v Speaker 1>And so a chimp brain and answer the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first part of your question is about 380</v>

103
00:04:44.711 --> 00:04:45.544
<v Speaker 1>grams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And australopithecines brain is about </v>

104
00:04:47.681 --> 00:04:48.514
<v Speaker 1>450 grams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So 3 million years of evolution and all </v>

105
00:04:51.101 --> 00:04:55.360
<v Speaker 1>we've got four to 70 grams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why do we get so smart?</v>

106
00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:57.430
<v Speaker 1>Why do we take off in the next few </v>
<v Speaker 1>million years?</v>

107
00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.740
<v Speaker 1>And what is it that Australopithecus did</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

108
00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.440
<v Speaker 1>that helped us survive?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And why do I call that the social late?</v>

109
00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:03.303
<v Speaker 1>That's all kind of tied together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the basic story is it by this point </v>

110
00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.620
<v Speaker 1>Australopithecus has become bipedal and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we can talk about how that happened,</v>

111
00:05:11.621 --> 00:05:14.050
<v Speaker 1>if you'd like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so because they're bipedal,</v>

112
00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.840
<v Speaker 1>their waste is now stretched out their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

113
00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:17.770
<v Speaker 1>their musculature.</v>

114
00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.190
<v Speaker 1>Like if you look at Chimpanzee Pecs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they aim upward because of course chimps</v>

115
00:05:21.191 --> 00:05:22.024
<v Speaker 1>climbing all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Australopithecus is more lateral </v>

116
00:05:24.311 --> 00:05:25.144
<v Speaker 1>like we are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're basically completely lateral </v>

117
00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.050
<v Speaker 1>because things are side to side as far </v>
<v Speaker 1>as we're concerned.</v>

118
00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:30.123
<v Speaker 1>It's harder to climb a tree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a whole lot easier to do a lot </v>

119
00:05:31.841 --> 00:05:33.630
<v Speaker 1>of other things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

120
00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:37.500
<v Speaker 1>we have much more limber shoulder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have much more limber wrist,</v>

121
00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:38.343
<v Speaker 1>all that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of that was in place by </v>

122
00:05:40.601 --> 00:05:44.320
<v Speaker 1>Australopithecus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So once they became bipedal,</v>

123
00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:45.363
<v Speaker 1>they gained a lot of these qualities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the question is why do those </v>

124
00:05:48.041 --> 00:05:49.150
<v Speaker 1>qualities matter?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

125
00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:51.820
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you watch a chimpanzee throw,</v>

126
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.833
<v Speaker 1>it's terrible at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though they're stronger than you </v>

127
00:05:54.071 --> 00:05:56.200
<v Speaker 1>and I are pound for pound by a sizable </v>
<v Speaker 1>margin.</v>

128
00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.760
<v Speaker 1>When they throw their inept,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't aim very well.</v>

129
00:05:58.761 --> 00:06:02.390
<v Speaker 1>And they typically use two hands because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not lined up well to throw.</v>

130
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.380
<v Speaker 1>If you watch a really good thrower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a grid iron football player,</v>

131
00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:08.180
<v Speaker 1>a baseball player,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a hunter gatherer throw,</v>

132
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.060
<v Speaker 1>you know it's a full body motion to step</v>
<v Speaker 1>forward with the other leg.</v>

133
00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:14.300
<v Speaker 1>There's this rotation and the very last </v>
<v Speaker 1>minute you bring your risks through.</v>

134
00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:18.920
<v Speaker 1>Well what that does is it creates an </v>
<v Speaker 1>enormous amount of elastic energy across</v>

135
00:06:18.921 --> 00:06:20.450
<v Speaker 1>your muscles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tendons and ligaments.</v>

136
00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:24.140
<v Speaker 1>And the end of that throw for a human is</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the snapping of a rubber band.</v>

137
00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:28.100
<v Speaker 1>So chimps can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not lined up properly.</v>

138
00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:32.060
<v Speaker 1>But australopithecus got to the point </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they could probably do that pretty</v>

139
00:06:32.061 --> 00:06:34.070
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so now,</v>

140
00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:35.373
<v Speaker 1>and this purely a byproduct to </v>
<v Speaker 1>bipedalism because it's stretched out </v>

141
00:06:37.851 --> 00:06:40.270
<v Speaker 1>their whole body and they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not climbing as much anymore.</v>

142
00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:41.113
<v Speaker 1>So their musculature is more lateral,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would have been helped them for </v>

143
00:06:43.461 --> 00:06:44.294
<v Speaker 1>throwing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now you get to a point where they </v>

144
00:06:46.161 --> 00:06:49.580
<v Speaker 1>have access to the single most important</v>
<v Speaker 1>military intervention in history,</v>

145
00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:52.160
<v Speaker 1>which is the capacity to kill it a </v>
<v Speaker 1>distance.</v>

146
00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:53.593
<v Speaker 1>So if you and I are running around the </v>
<v Speaker 1>savannah and lion attacks us and we got </v>

147
00:06:56.061 --> 00:06:58.790
<v Speaker 1>50 of our best friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could kill it with our bare hands,</v>

148
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.770
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of us are going to die in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>process,</v>

149
00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:01.753
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you think 50 of us can get 100 </v>

150
00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.193
<v Speaker 1>that someone think even though it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a bunch of Nice and shy and I'd be </v>

151
00:07:09.531 --> 00:07:13.790
<v Speaker 1>super confident where other people you </v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't worry very much but.</v>

152
00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:15.920
<v Speaker 1>But even if we could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we knew what we're doing.</v>

153
00:07:15.921 --> 00:07:17.450
<v Speaker 1>We're all armed with knives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoever,</v>

154
00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:22.160
<v Speaker 1>whoever goes first screwed right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the capacity to kill the distance</v>

155
00:07:22.161 --> 00:07:22.994
<v Speaker 1>that will allows a larger force of </v>
<v Speaker 1>weaker individuals to come to easily </v>

156
00:07:26.001 --> 00:07:30.200
<v Speaker 1>defeat a stronger individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so once they gained this capacity to</v>

157
00:07:30.201 --> 00:07:31.034
<v Speaker 1>throw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they were attacked by lions or </v>

158
00:07:32.181 --> 00:07:33.014
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas in the past they just scattered </v>

159
00:07:34.371 --> 00:07:35.204
<v Speaker 1>for the trees.</v>

160
00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:38.070
<v Speaker 1>Now they could throw stones at it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>defend themselves now.</v>

161
00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.750
<v Speaker 1>And australopithecus throwing rocks at </v>
<v Speaker 1>alliant is going to be in the belly of a</v>

162
00:07:41.751 --> 00:07:43.700
<v Speaker 1>slightly annoyed line in about three </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes.</v>

163
00:07:43.701 --> 00:07:46.940
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But 50 australopithecines throwing rocks</v>

164
00:07:46.941 --> 00:07:50.410
<v Speaker 1>at Lyons is a totally different story </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so it's the.</v>

165
00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:52.910
<v Speaker 1>This is the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here is the throwing hypothesis there,</v>

166
00:07:52.911 --> 00:07:53.930
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what changed?</v>

167
00:07:53.931 --> 00:07:54.764
<v Speaker 1>Everything was throwing and the reason </v>
<v Speaker 1>it changed everything is that it caused </v>

168
00:07:57.531 --> 00:07:58.364
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the first reason why we should </v>

169
00:08:00.081 --> 00:08:00.914
<v Speaker 1>have any effective collective action </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's not a good strategy when </v>

170
00:08:03.531 --> 00:08:04.364
<v Speaker 1>you're on your own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a good strategy if I do it in </v>

171
00:08:06.291 --> 00:08:08.150
<v Speaker 1>the rest of the group hits heads for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>trees,</v>

172
00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.820
<v Speaker 1>but it's a great strategy if we all do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it together.</v>

173
00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:15.320
<v Speaker 1>And so for the first time in history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the group's goals in our history,</v>

174
00:08:15.321 --> 00:08:16.610
<v Speaker 1>in our line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the primate line,</v>

175
00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:19.130
<v Speaker 1>the group's goals aligned with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual goals,</v>

176
00:08:19.131 --> 00:08:19.964
<v Speaker 1>which is let's cooperate and work </v>
<v Speaker 1>together to try to drive away these </v>

177
00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:23.233
<v Speaker 1>predators.</v>

178
00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:25.213
<v Speaker 1>Now it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at a lion and you look at </v>

179
00:08:27.591 --> 00:08:29.900
<v Speaker 1>someone throwing rocks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it still seems like a really big ask,</v>

180
00:08:29.901 --> 00:08:32.150
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>To drive that thing away or kill it,</v>

181
00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:33.920
<v Speaker 1>throwing rocks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so.</v>

182
00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:35.293
<v Speaker 1>But Barbara Isaac was one of the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>anthropologist to propose this </v>

183
00:08:37.521 --> 00:08:38.354
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis quite awhile ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Went Back and looked through the </v>

184
00:08:39.921 --> 00:08:40.754
<v Speaker 1>historical record and these </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinary stories of how effective </v>

185
00:08:43.431 --> 00:08:44.264
<v Speaker 1>people are throwing rocks and so in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the Portuguese went to the Canary </v>

186
00:08:47.841 --> 00:08:50.420
<v Speaker 1>Islands to try to subjugate it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they rock up with,</v>

187
00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>armor guns,</v>

188
00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:53.203
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crossbows and this isn't the 14 </v>

189
00:08:55.411 --> 00:08:56.190
<v Speaker 1>something</v>

190
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:57.023
<v Speaker 2>and all the locals were on with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with stones and despite the fact that </v>

191
00:08:59.551 --> 00:09:01.710
<v Speaker 2>the Portuguese are there in army </v>
<v Speaker 2>trained,</v>

192
00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ready to shoot and,</v>

193
00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:04.093
<v Speaker 2>and in their armor they were just </v>
<v Speaker 2>decimated by the local stone rock </v>

194
00:09:06.321 --> 00:09:07.154
<v Speaker 2>center.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the stories happened over and over </v>

195
00:09:08.551 --> 00:09:09.960
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you read these accounts,</v>

196
00:09:09.961 --> 00:09:12.330
<v Speaker 2>they're extraordinary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can read you some examples from here.</v>

197
00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:14.880
<v Speaker 2>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the happened in Australia,</v>

198
00:09:14.881 --> 00:09:16.920
<v Speaker 2>it happened in the Canary Islands that </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened elsewhere.</v>

199
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:19.050
<v Speaker 2>They just throw rocks incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 2>accurately,</v>

200
00:09:19.051 --> 00:09:22.290
<v Speaker 2>incredibly hard and really fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

201
00:09:22.291 --> 00:09:23.124
<v Speaker 2>and there's know accounts in Africa </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically killing a zebra with one blow </v>

202
00:09:26.941 --> 00:09:27.900
<v Speaker 2>of Iraq to the head.</v>

203
00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:33.450
<v Speaker 2>So like a pitcher of major league </v>
<v Speaker 2>pitcher.</v>

204
00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:37.080
<v Speaker 2>Exactly what rock who gets very accurate</v>
<v Speaker 2>at it.</v>

205
00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:39.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So do you think they must have practiced</v>

206
00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:42.900
<v Speaker 2>constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what I suspect is that we evolved</v>

207
00:09:42.901 --> 00:09:45.100
<v Speaker 2>to like to throw rocks and so if I let </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

208
00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:47.160
<v Speaker 2>if I look at my son as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

209
00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:50.130
<v Speaker 2>when he was 18 months old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we will be walking back toward that.</v>

210
00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:51.023
<v Speaker 2>Sophie saw a rock on the street,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he pick it up and started trying to </v>

211
00:09:52.951 --> 00:09:54.390
<v Speaker 2>throw it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my wife was like,</v>

212
00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:54.661
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

213
00:09:54.661 --> 00:09:56.580
<v Speaker 2>don't let him throw rocks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's only going to cause trouble.</v>

214
00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:57.633
<v Speaker 2>First of all I'm thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well maybe I'll develop a good arm so </v>

215
00:09:58.831 --> 00:09:59.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go ahead and let him </v>
<v Speaker 2>anyway.</v>

216
00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:02.220
<v Speaker 2>But secondly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he fricking wants to.</v>

217
00:10:02.221 --> 00:10:04.450
<v Speaker 2>This is something inherently fun for </v>
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>

218
00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:05.413
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think all humans enjoy throwing </v>

219
00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:10.530
<v Speaker 2>and it's stunning how good you can get </v>
<v Speaker 2>it with practice.</v>

220
00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:11.880
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

221
00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:16.020
<v Speaker 2>we were at the Ohio state fair this </v>
<v Speaker 2>before my son was born and I was walking</v>

222
00:10:16.021 --> 00:10:19.050
<v Speaker 2>by one of these stalls where you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>throw in a radar gun.</v>

223
00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:20.153
<v Speaker 2>And so I thought the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just starting to date my wife and </v>

224
00:10:22.171 --> 00:10:22.501
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

225
00:10:22.501 --> 00:10:23.970
<v Speaker 2>here's a perfect chance to impress her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

226
00:10:23.971 --> 00:10:25.320
<v Speaker 2>And how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much you I am.</v>

227
00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:26.071
<v Speaker 2>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

228
00:10:26.071 --> 00:10:28.140
<v Speaker 2>why don't I stop and I'll throw some </v>
<v Speaker 2>balls here and this net,</v>

229
00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:30.210
<v Speaker 2>because I hadn't ever thrown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know how fast I could.</v>

230
00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:31.470
<v Speaker 2>So she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

231
00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:33.180
<v Speaker 2>And I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I played like literally Greg.</v>

232
00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:37.860
<v Speaker 2>So I throw the ball and it's like 50 </v>
<v Speaker 2>miles an hour and she's pretty impressed</v>

233
00:10:37.861 --> 00:10:39.590
<v Speaker 2>because that's sounds fast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

234
00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:43.590
<v Speaker 2>Then it's like kid shows up next to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's got to be 12 years old,</v>

235
00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:44.603
<v Speaker 2>probably weighs 85 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This total gangland not a muscle in his </v>

236
00:10:46.771 --> 00:10:47.460
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>

237
00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:48.293
<v Speaker 2>And he just starts to fricking thrown </v>
<v Speaker 2>ball after ball at like 65 miles an </v>

238
00:10:50.461 --> 00:10:52.080
<v Speaker 2>hour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like fuck,</v>

239
00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:53.093
<v Speaker 2>I mean she's not going to be impressed </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's like human twig next to me </v>

240
00:10:55.111 --> 00:10:56.130
<v Speaker 2>is kicking my ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

241
00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:59.940
<v Speaker 2>And so I pick up the last ball,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fucking throw it as hard as I can,</v>

242
00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:02.310
<v Speaker 2>hurts my shoulder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>flies off at an odd angle,</v>

243
00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:04.800
<v Speaker 2>doesn't hit anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's like 57 miles an hour.</v>

244
00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:06.870
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that little guy who's like literally the</v>

245
00:11:06.871 --> 00:11:07.704
<v Speaker 2>size of the nostril,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pythagoras was thrown at 65 and hitting </v>

246
00:11:09.961 --> 00:11:13.380
<v Speaker 2>the target every time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's obvious that it's skill,</v>

247
00:11:13.381 --> 00:11:15.120
<v Speaker 2>it's practice that would've made you </v>
<v Speaker 2>good at this,</v>

248
00:11:15.121 --> 00:11:17.310
<v Speaker 2>and if your life depends on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to do it.</v>

249
00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:18.480
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense.</v>

250
00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:19.703
<v Speaker 2>Coming from a martial arts background,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like coordinated movement where at the </v>

251
00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:29.660
<v Speaker 2>end of it you snap exactly makes sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>that this technique is so critical,</v>

252
00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:30.723
<v Speaker 2>even though you're a larger person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So better technique would have more of </v>

253
00:11:33.301 --> 00:11:36.570
<v Speaker 2>an impact with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the throwing arm,</v>

254
00:11:36.571 --> 00:11:39.630
<v Speaker 2>I had read this and if that was one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the hypothesis,</v>

255
00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:40.733
<v Speaker 2>several hypothesis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why the human brain doubled over a </v>

256
00:11:43.081 --> 00:11:45.810
<v Speaker 2>period of 2 million years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another one was cooked meat,</v>

257
00:11:45.811 --> 00:11:46.644
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They figured out a way to get more </v>

258
00:11:48.661 --> 00:11:51.120
<v Speaker 2>nutrients out of meat that's writing </v>
<v Speaker 2>over fire,</v>

259
00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.470
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's a little bit down the road.</v>

260
00:11:52.471 --> 00:11:54.010
<v Speaker 2>So here we are and a half million years </v>
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>

261
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:55.053
<v Speaker 1>And so for the first time we put some </v>
<v Speaker 1>pressure on ourselves to have an </v>

262
00:11:56.981 --> 00:11:59.950
<v Speaker 1>advantage to be smarter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So imagine you're a zebra.</v>

263
00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:02.350
<v Speaker 1>You know what the hell good is it to you</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be Einstein.</v>

264
00:12:02.351 --> 00:12:04.060
<v Speaker 1>You got what are you going to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that brain?</v>

265
00:12:04.061 --> 00:12:05.320
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's a big.</v>

266
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:06.183
<v Speaker 1>It's a big cost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our brains are 20 percent of our </v>

267
00:12:07.931 --> 00:12:10.660
<v Speaker 1>metabolic energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether we're doing math or watching tv,</v>

268
00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:12.430
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's constant drain.</v>

269
00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:15.370
<v Speaker 1>And so what our ancestors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would they pay for that drain?</v>

270
00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:16.930
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just recently,</v>

271
00:12:16.931 --> 00:12:20.800
<v Speaker 1>there was a paper that came out maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>three months ago now on um,</v>

272
00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:22.443
<v Speaker 1>a new brand expansion gene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They found it or they think that's what </v>

273
00:12:24.131 --> 00:12:26.650
<v Speaker 1>it is called notch to an l.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it turns out,</v>

274
00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:27.521
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>12,</v>

275
00:12:27.521 --> 00:12:28.354
<v Speaker 1>15 million years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was an accidental duplication of </v>

276
00:12:30.581 --> 00:12:31.414
<v Speaker 1>that gene on our genome and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was ineffective and it just sat </v>

277
00:12:33.431 --> 00:12:34.264
<v Speaker 1>there doing nothing.</v>

278
00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:35.493
<v Speaker 1>Now that's a great way that evolution </v>
<v Speaker 1>works where it accidentally doubles the </v>

279
00:12:37.721 --> 00:12:39.760
<v Speaker 1>gene because then you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can mess with it.</v>

280
00:12:39.761 --> 00:12:41.530
<v Speaker 1>And the old jeans still doing the job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

281
00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:42.843
<v Speaker 1>So it sat there for about 9 million </v>
<v Speaker 1>years in our line till about 3 million </v>

282
00:12:45.641 --> 00:12:47.200
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>round Australopithecus.</v>

283
00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:50.050
<v Speaker 1>And then it duplicated itself and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>came online again.</v>

284
00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:54.250
<v Speaker 1>And what that gene seems to do is it </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes our brain remain as stem cells for</v>

285
00:12:54.251 --> 00:12:55.084
<v Speaker 1>longer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means a lot more duplication </v>

286
00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:58.870
<v Speaker 1>before they run away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And start becoming neurons.</v>

287
00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:00.213
<v Speaker 1>And so if I had to guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd say that that probably that gene </v>

288
00:13:04.661 --> 00:13:05.494
<v Speaker 1>coming online probably happened many </v>
<v Speaker 1>times in the past and every time it </v>

289
00:13:08.051 --> 00:13:10.240
<v Speaker 1>happened in the past it was more costs </v>
<v Speaker 1>than it was worth.</v>

290
00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:11.313
<v Speaker 1>And so what's the chimp going to do with</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit more brain and just needs </v>

291
00:13:13.421 --> 00:13:14.920
<v Speaker 1>more calories and what does he gain from</v>
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>

292
00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:18.700
<v Speaker 1>But now that we're working together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now that we have collective action,</v>

293
00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:20.980
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of things open up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could,</v>

294
00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:23.290
<v Speaker 1>we could devise division of labor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll say,</v>

295
00:13:23.291 --> 00:13:24.790
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do this and I'll do that.</v>

296
00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:28.090
<v Speaker 1>Because also the [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've got 70 more grams and a chimp.</v>

297
00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:30.940
<v Speaker 1>They can't do things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they can all throw rocks at the same</v>

298
00:13:30.941 --> 00:13:32.320
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not rocket science,</v>

299
00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:33.513
<v Speaker 1>but all the kinds of things that came </v>
<v Speaker 1>next probably were enabled by that </v>

300
00:13:36.851 --> 00:13:39.970
<v Speaker 1>process of us coming together and </v>
<v Speaker 1>deciding to work together and cooperate.</v>

301
00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:42.910
<v Speaker 1>So if you look at chimpanzees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't cooperate very well.</v>

302
00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:45.070
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

303
00:13:45.071 --> 00:13:47.890
<v Speaker 1>one of the activities were they sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>cooperate is when they hunt monkeys.</v>

304
00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:49.083
<v Speaker 1>And so the law gather around and they'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>see some monkeys in the trees and they </v>

305
00:13:51.441 --> 00:13:54.070
<v Speaker 1>come in from every angle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not very coordinated.</v>

306
00:13:54.071 --> 00:13:55.540
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of a wild free for all.</v>

307
00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:58.300
<v Speaker 1>But what's interesting about it is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>when the hunts over,</v>

308
00:13:58.780 --> 00:13:59.613
<v Speaker 1>let's say you just sat there the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>time and watched and I'm working my ass </v>

309
00:14:01.541 --> 00:14:03.490
<v Speaker 1>off chasing these monkeys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got one.</v>

310
00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:05.400
<v Speaker 1>You come up and bug me for it and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>

311
00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:08.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't willingly handle it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You like keep nudging me until I share,</v>

312
00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:11.200
<v Speaker 1>but I'm just as likely to share with you</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you helped as if you didn't.</v>

313
00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:12.243
<v Speaker 1>I don't make any distinction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you'll never established effective </v>

314
00:14:14.591 --> 00:14:17.950
<v Speaker 1>groups if you can't reward those who </v>
<v Speaker 1>participate compared to those who don't.</v>

315
00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:20.350
<v Speaker 1>Even little kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four year old kids.</v>

316
00:14:20.351 --> 00:14:23.110
<v Speaker 1>When you give them games to play and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they earn stickers.</v>

317
00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:24.990
<v Speaker 1>If you didn't play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't.</v>

318
00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:26.440
<v Speaker 1>When you come up and ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't get it.</v>

319
00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:28.330
<v Speaker 1>You played.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you didn't do your job right,</v>

320
00:14:28.331 --> 00:14:29.110
<v Speaker 1>but you tried,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>

321
00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:32.210
<v Speaker 1>you can have a sticker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So humans immediately get that,</v>

322
00:14:32.211 --> 00:14:34.780
<v Speaker 1>that you get rewarded for your </v>
<v Speaker 1>activities as part of the group.</v>

323
00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:37.630
<v Speaker 1>Chimps don't seem to have that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fascinating because.</v>

324
00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:41.860
<v Speaker 1>But because chimps really do have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of fairness though,</v>

325
00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:42.993
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the issues that happened </v>

326
00:14:44.501 --> 00:14:48.130
<v Speaker 1>with the captive chimps that attack the </v>
<v Speaker 1>man who brought the birthday cake.</v>

327
00:14:48.131 --> 00:14:49.240
<v Speaker 1>Do you know that story?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

328
00:14:49.241 --> 00:14:51.810
<v Speaker 1>That's too awful story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These couple,</v>

329
00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:52.963
<v Speaker 3>they kept a chimp as a pet for a long </v>
<v Speaker 3>time and then as it got older it got a </v>

330
00:14:56.781 --> 00:14:57.614
<v Speaker 3>little violent and they had to bring it </v>
<v Speaker 3>to a sanctuary and they brought it to a </v>

331
00:15:00.231 --> 00:15:01.064
<v Speaker 3>sanctuary and they would go to visit it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the chimp would remember them and </v>

332
00:15:03.111 --> 00:15:04.910
<v Speaker 3>they went to visit it and it was on his </v>
<v Speaker 3>birthday.</v>

333
00:15:04.911 --> 00:15:05.744
<v Speaker 3>So they brought him a cake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the other chimps in the sanctuary </v>

334
00:15:08.031 --> 00:15:09.860
<v Speaker 3>were furious that they didn't get the </v>
<v Speaker 3>cake,</v>

335
00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:11.420
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as well.</v>

336
00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:13.370
<v Speaker 3>They didn't think it was fair or they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>angry.</v>

337
00:15:13.371 --> 00:15:17.960
<v Speaker 3>So they figured out somebody had left a </v>
<v Speaker 3>gate open and they got out and tour this</v>

338
00:15:17.961 --> 00:15:20.630
<v Speaker 3>guy apart because he didn't give them a </v>
<v Speaker 3>cake.</v>

339
00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:21.533
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's the most famous example of </v>

340
00:15:22.961 --> 00:15:24.390
<v Speaker 1>that is actually with capital and </v>
<v Speaker 1>monkeys,</v>

341
00:15:24.391 --> 00:15:25.224
<v Speaker 1>which aren't nearly as smart as chimps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's this amazing study by Sarah </v>

342
00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:30.660
<v Speaker 1>Bronfman and Frans de Waal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you want to see it in action,</v>

343
00:15:30.661 --> 00:15:33.390
<v Speaker 1>dwell has it on a Ted talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really quite something to see.</v>

344
00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:37.470
<v Speaker 1>And what they do in that study is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>teacher these capuchin monkeys to.</v>

345
00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:38.513
<v Speaker 1>They give them pebble and they teach the</v>
<v Speaker 1>captions to return the pebble and they </v>

346
00:15:40.951 --> 00:15:41.784
<v Speaker 1>give it a cucumber slice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's learning the game for </v>

347
00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:46.260
<v Speaker 1>cucumber slices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you wanted to ask,</v>

348
00:15:46.261 --> 00:15:47.880
<v Speaker 1>does the monkey think that's a fair </v>
<v Speaker 1>reward?</v>

349
00:15:47.881 --> 00:15:49.090
<v Speaker 1>The answer has to be yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

350
00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:51.060
<v Speaker 1>because it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's doing that for cucumber.</v>

351
00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:53.430
<v Speaker 1>So now you and I are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both monkeys were in our cage.</v>

352
00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:55.650
<v Speaker 1>I returned the pebble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get a cucumber.</v>

353
00:15:55.950 --> 00:15:58.830
<v Speaker 1>Now you return the pebble and they hand </v>
<v Speaker 1>you a great capuchins.</v>

354
00:15:58.890 --> 00:16:02.490
<v Speaker 1>Much prefer grapes over cucumbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then what happens next?</v>

355
00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:03.473
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been doing this behavior for </v>

356
00:16:04.141 --> 00:16:06.150
<v Speaker 1>cucumbers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as soon as you get a great,</v>

357
00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:06.691
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

358
00:16:06.691 --> 00:16:07.524
<v Speaker 1>I'm not playing anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you watch this tape and the cabbage </v>

359
00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:11.820
<v Speaker 1>in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They give you a great,</v>

360
00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:14.160
<v Speaker 1>they give me the cucumber and the thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>looks totally pissed.</v>

361
00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:15.203
<v Speaker 1>It starts pounding on the ground and </v>
<v Speaker 1>throws the cucumber back or it's </v>

362
00:16:17.641 --> 00:16:18.474
<v Speaker 1>amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

363
00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:20.520
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the question is what does that mean?</v>

364
00:16:20.521 --> 00:16:22.590
<v Speaker 1>Why do they care about fairness in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>way?</v>

365
00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:23.723
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think the answer to that question </v>

366
00:16:25.171 --> 00:16:30.171
<v Speaker 1>is sexual selection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the key to sexual selection is it</v>

367
00:16:30.871 --> 00:16:31.704
<v Speaker 1>doesn't matter what everybody's getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>so long as I'm getting about as much as </v>

368
00:16:34.441 --> 00:16:35.274
<v Speaker 1>everybody else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the second that you're starting </v>

369
00:16:36.481 --> 00:16:39.990
<v Speaker 1>to get more than I have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then whatever females in our group,</v>

370
00:16:39.991 --> 00:16:41.550
<v Speaker 1>she's going to pick you before she picks</v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

371
00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:44.790
<v Speaker 1>And so everything is relative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We may think now,</v>

372
00:16:44.791 --> 00:16:46.890
<v Speaker 1>why do you care so much about what other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are doing?</v>

373
00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:48.660
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you just be happy with what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you got?</v>

374
00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:49.673
<v Speaker 1>But literally the day you find out that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy in the studio over salary's </v>

375
00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:57.660
<v Speaker 1>twice years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your salary sucks because it makes sense</v>

376
00:16:57.661 --> 00:16:58.494
<v Speaker 1>because literally she's going to choose </v>
<v Speaker 1>him now before she chooses you </v>

377
00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:03.780
<v Speaker 1>comparison's the thief of joy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

378
00:17:03.781 --> 00:17:04.870
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a.</v>

379
00:17:04.871 --> 00:17:08.490
<v Speaker 1>it's a really unfortunate fact because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes it matters a lot.</v>

380
00:17:08.491 --> 00:17:11.780
<v Speaker 1>Like for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine I invented drug and I say here,</v>

381
00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:13.440
<v Speaker 1>take a dose in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll double your Iq.</v>

382
00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:14.940
<v Speaker 1>Instantly you're going to feel like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>genius,</v>

383
00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:17.130
<v Speaker 1>but unbeknownst to I gave everybody two </v>
<v Speaker 1>doses.</v>

384
00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:18.173
<v Speaker 1>You walk out of there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to feel like a dumb ass </v>

385
00:17:19.051 --> 00:17:21.240
<v Speaker 1>because there's people saying stuff you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can understand,</v>

386
00:17:21.241 --> 00:17:23.010
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then it would matter,</v>

387
00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:26.930
<v Speaker 1>but the killer cases or things where </v>
<v Speaker 1>where it's only just a residence.</v>

388
00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:27.803
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this amazing study where they </v>

389
00:17:29.341 --> 00:17:33.630
<v Speaker 1>showed that people were making minimum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just above minimum wage are the ones who</v>

390
00:17:33.631 --> 00:17:37.340
<v Speaker 1>don't want you to raise minimum wage to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the most against it real.</v>

391
00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:38.460
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would that be?</v>

392
00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:40.950
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now they've got a slight advantage</v>

393
00:17:40.951 --> 00:17:41.784
<v Speaker 1>over people making minimum wage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The day minimum wage gets raised now </v>

394
00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:47.580
<v Speaker 1>they're not any better off than anybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

395
00:17:47.581 --> 00:17:49.650
<v Speaker 1>So even though they're the most likely </v>
<v Speaker 1>to from it,</v>

396
00:17:49.651 --> 00:17:50.010
<v Speaker 1>because they</v>

397
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:52.620
<v Speaker 2>may lose that job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have enough to take minimum wage.</v>

398
00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:55.740
<v Speaker 2>They're actually against it because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>gives them a slight advantage over,</v>

399
00:17:55.741 --> 00:17:56.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy next door.</v>

400
00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:57.743
<v Speaker 2>This is based on one study because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>would think that the people that would </v>

401
00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:03.390
<v Speaker 2>be most against it will be the people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are hiring folks are at.</v>

402
00:18:03.391 --> 00:18:05.070
<v Speaker 2>Fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's only,</v>

403
00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:09.340
<v Speaker 2>it's only looking at income so the boss </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably feels even the more negative of</v>

404
00:18:09.341 --> 00:18:10.174
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you look at people's income and </v>

405
00:18:11.041 --> 00:18:11.874
<v Speaker 2>their and their feelings about raising </v>
<v Speaker 2>the minimum wage that people are making </v>

406
00:18:14.281 --> 00:18:15.114
<v Speaker 2>minimum wage wanted to go up the people </v>
<v Speaker 2>one notch above do not and then as the </v>

407
00:18:17.581 --> 00:18:18.810
<v Speaker 2>higher you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do again.</v>

408
00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:19.940
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

409
00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:20.843
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Up until you get to the point where </v>

410
00:18:22.471 --> 00:18:25.470
<v Speaker 2>you're employing people and some </v>
<v Speaker 2>employers want to raise it.</v>

411
00:18:25.471 --> 00:18:26.190
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

412
00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:28.170
<v Speaker 2>and some don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's huge argument about that.</v>

413
00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:29.033
<v Speaker 2>Now when it comes back to the capital </v>
<v Speaker 2>and monkeys does the same effect happen </v>

414
00:18:31.891 --> 00:18:34.590
<v Speaker 2>whether it's a female or a male.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

415
00:18:34.591 --> 00:18:37.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean so thing is people argue like </v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy about exactly what this means.</v>

416
00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:41.220
<v Speaker 2>I don't think the monkeys have a sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>of fairness like you and I have,</v>

417
00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:43.740
<v Speaker 2>but I do think they have a sense of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hold on,</v>

418
00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:46.260
<v Speaker 2>you're getting more than I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't let this happen,</v>

419
00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:47.453
<v Speaker 2>otherwise I'm screwed and there's lots </v>
<v Speaker 2>of great evidence that if you let that </v>

420
00:18:49.501 --> 00:18:50.334
<v Speaker 2>happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're screwed.</v>

421
00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:51.293
<v Speaker 2>But do the females have that same sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>of competitiveness that they need to </v>

422
00:18:54.661 --> 00:18:55.494
<v Speaker 2>have the exact same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those other bitches or having to get </v>

423
00:18:57.481 --> 00:18:58.291
<v Speaker 2>angry?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

424
00:18:58.291 --> 00:18:59.124
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it depends on whether you're mating </v>

425
00:19:01.831 --> 00:19:04.290
<v Speaker 2>system is going to be pair bonding or </v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

426
00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:08.340
<v Speaker 2>so if you're a frog or a lots of </v>
<v Speaker 2>different products,</v>

427
00:19:08.341 --> 00:19:09.174
<v Speaker 2>not all of them are laughing tree frog </v>
<v Speaker 2>or if you're a elephant seal or </v>

428
00:19:12.361 --> 00:19:14.580
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll all the females mate with the best</v>

429
00:19:14.581 --> 00:19:19.100
<v Speaker 2>male because his job is just sex and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>every female can add the best one or the</v>

430
00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:22.140
<v Speaker 2>either in a situation where they've got </v>
<v Speaker 2>no choice like the elephant seals.</v>

431
00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:22.973
<v Speaker 2>He controls the rookery or in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation where they just listened to </v>

432
00:19:25.531 --> 00:19:27.600
<v Speaker 2>all the croaking and then the guard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're the best broker,</v>

433
00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:28.493
<v Speaker 2>you're the dad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if your pair bonding like humans or </v>

434
00:19:31.981 --> 00:19:33.930
<v Speaker 2>like lots of other animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>birds,</v>

435
00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:34.773
<v Speaker 2>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The then what you need is you've got </v>

436
00:19:36.871 --> 00:19:37.704
<v Speaker 2>competition on both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she's always compeTing to get the </v>

437
00:19:40.261 --> 00:19:43.050
<v Speaker 2>best male and he's always competing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get the best female.</v>

438
00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:47.430
<v Speaker 2>And there's reasons why male male </v>
<v Speaker 2>competition is always a bit more intense</v>

439
00:19:47.431 --> 00:19:49.830
<v Speaker 2>than female female competition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But both of them are there.</v>

440
00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:50.933
<v Speaker 2>And the more monogamous the system gets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more both sides compete for each </v>

441
00:19:53.491 --> 00:19:55.080
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hm,</v>

442
00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:56.063
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what about in the case of like </v>

443
00:19:58.330 --> 00:19:59.163
<v Speaker 2>bonobo's where they're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So polyamorous and elbows are super </v>

444
00:20:02.641 --> 00:20:03.474
<v Speaker 2>interesting systems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you've got lots of polyamorous </v>

445
00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:05.990
<v Speaker 2>animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

446
00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:08.190
<v Speaker 2>banabos or interests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their chimps are also,</v>

447
00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:09.121
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you look at,</v>

448
00:20:09.121 --> 00:20:09.954
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the great ways to look at our </v>

449
00:20:11.461 --> 00:20:12.294
<v Speaker 2>ancestors and what their lives were like</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you look in your trousers and </v>

450
00:20:14.611 --> 00:20:15.444
<v Speaker 2>the size of your testicles tells you a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot about what sort of mating system </v>

451
00:20:18.811 --> 00:20:19.740
<v Speaker 2>your ancestors had.</v>

452
00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:20.783
<v Speaker 2>So gorillas have tiny little testicles </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the reason that they have such tiny </v>

453
00:20:23.821 --> 00:20:24.654
<v Speaker 2>testicles as they use their huge body to</v>
<v Speaker 2>drive away the other males and then all </v>

454
00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:28.713
<v Speaker 2>the females are in his harem so he </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't need big testicles because he </v>

455
00:20:31.441 --> 00:20:34.500
<v Speaker 2>only needs a sperm in order to </v>
<v Speaker 2>inseminate the females he's got.</v>

456
00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:37.200
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't take much sperm to inseminate</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone.</v>

457
00:20:37.201 --> 00:20:40.110
<v Speaker 2>Female and testicles are really </v>
<v Speaker 2>expensive tissue to make.</v>

458
00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:42.060
<v Speaker 2>And if you want a pair and you land on </v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

459
00:20:42.061 --> 00:20:43.620
<v Speaker 2>you know they're uncomfortable too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

460
00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:44.783
<v Speaker 2>And so then you look at our testicles </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're quite a bit bigger than a </v>

461
00:20:47.561 --> 00:20:48.394
<v Speaker 2>gorillas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're nowhere near the size of a </v>

462
00:20:49.331 --> 00:20:51.460
<v Speaker 2>chimp or urbanova.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both.</v>

463
00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:52.593
<v Speaker 2>They're baSically in many ways almost </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same beast and so although socially </v>

464
00:20:55.661 --> 00:20:56.494
<v Speaker 2>quite different and they have a system </v>
<v Speaker 2>where they basically have to wash out </v>

465
00:20:59.831 --> 00:21:00.664
<v Speaker 2>the guy who was there before them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it takes really big testicles to </v>

466
00:21:03.131 --> 00:21:05.400
<v Speaker 2>have sperm competition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So their competition is.</v>

467
00:21:05.401 --> 00:21:07.690
<v Speaker 2>And by fighting each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although there's a degree of that too,</v>

468
00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:10.180
<v Speaker 2>they know full well that when she comes </v>
<v Speaker 2>into estrus,</v>

469
00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:12.320
<v Speaker 2>into heat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be aligned.</v>

470
00:21:12.370 --> 00:21:13.203
<v Speaker 2>And if you're fifth in line and you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>wash everybody out before you might end </v>

471
00:21:15.561 --> 00:21:18.250
<v Speaker 2>up the dad wash everybody out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a funny way of putting it.</v>

472
00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:19.203
<v Speaker 2>So it's not.</v>

473
00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:21.893
<v Speaker 2>It's a this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this testicle size is directly </v>

474
00:21:23.951 --> 00:21:26.260
<v Speaker 2>proportionate to the number of </v>
<v Speaker 2>promiscuous females.</v>

475
00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:27.520
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

476
00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:31.120
<v Speaker 2>The promise acuity the mating system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if you look at our mating system,</v>

477
00:21:31.121 --> 00:21:33.580
<v Speaker 2>we clearly evolved to be largely </v>
<v Speaker 2>monogamous,</v>

478
00:21:33.581 --> 00:21:34.414
<v Speaker 2>but not entirely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our testicles are unnecessarily large </v>

479
00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:37.203
<v Speaker 2>for for an entirely monogamous species.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we're a little bit on the wash </v>

480
00:21:40.451 --> 00:21:41.284
<v Speaker 2>the guy out ahead of us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's many people to make arguments </v>

481
00:21:44.501 --> 00:21:48.310
<v Speaker 2>that are monogamy's socially reinforced </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's not natural.</v>

482
00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:49.593
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at hunter gatherers and and </v>

483
00:21:51.371 --> 00:21:53.500
<v Speaker 2>so the best,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best way that we get a sense of,</v>

484
00:21:53.501 --> 00:21:54.334
<v Speaker 2>well what did we evolve to do is to look</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the remaining hunter gatherer </v>

485
00:21:56.981 --> 00:21:57.814
<v Speaker 2>societies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly if you look at what are </v>

486
00:21:59.141 --> 00:22:02.560
<v Speaker 2>called immediate return on togethers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there are people who eat today,</v>

487
00:22:02.561 --> 00:22:04.990
<v Speaker 2>what they killed today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got a lot of hunter gatherers.</v>

488
00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:05.823
<v Speaker 2>Once they left the equator,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they could store food and everything </v>

489
00:22:08.411 --> 00:22:10.120
<v Speaker 2>changed for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they actually,</v>

490
00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:11.073
<v Speaker 2>in many of the behaviors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they look a lot like us and we can come </v>

491
00:22:12.251 --> 00:22:14.950
<v Speaker 2>back to that if you'd like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you look at hunter gathers around</v>

492
00:22:14.951 --> 00:22:17.140
<v Speaker 2>the equator there typically immediate </v>
<v Speaker 2>return,</v>

493
00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:18.333
<v Speaker 2>kill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat,</v>

494
00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:22.510
<v Speaker 2>and so those guys tend to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tend to be,</v>

495
00:22:22.511 --> 00:22:23.344
<v Speaker 2>there's always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course human differences where it's </v>

496
00:22:24.101 --> 00:22:27.910
<v Speaker 2>super variable species,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they tend to be serially monogamous.</v>

497
00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:32.020
<v Speaker 2>And so some people pair up for life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lots of people pair up for five,</v>

498
00:22:32.021 --> 00:22:34.720
<v Speaker 2>seven years and then break apart and </v>
<v Speaker 2>pair up again.</v>

499
00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:37.630
<v Speaker 2>And so you have a sequence of children </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the secrets of people,</v>

500
00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:40.840
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but largely monogamists not entirely.</v>

501
00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:42.940
<v Speaker 2>And in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>monogamous during those time periods,</v>

502
00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:47.050
<v Speaker 2>largely now we know every single animal </v>
<v Speaker 2>we've ever described as monogamous.</v>

503
00:22:47.051 --> 00:22:49.450
<v Speaker 2>When we do the dnA,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we now find they're not entirely,</v>

504
00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:51.070
<v Speaker 2>but they're mostly.</v>

505
00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:52.420
<v Speaker 2>Hm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

506
00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:53.610
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

507
00:22:53.850 --> 00:22:56.530
<v Speaker 2>have you ever had sex at dawn?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did you think of that?</v>

508
00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:58.180
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no offense,</v>

509
00:22:58.181 --> 00:22:59.710
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's total crap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

510
00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:01.150
<v Speaker 2>chris ryan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you hear that shit?</v>

511
00:23:01.151 --> 00:23:03.010
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's rocking on your book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bro.</v>

512
00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:04.021
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

513
00:23:04.021 --> 00:23:07.420
<v Speaker 2>what did you think is crap about it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't think the system works that</v>

514
00:23:07.421 --> 00:23:08.254
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The the explain to people that may or </v>

515
00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:10.263
<v Speaker 2>may not know what we're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't read that book now since it </v>

516
00:23:11.741 --> 00:23:12.880
<v Speaker 2>came out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let me remind,</v>

517
00:23:12.910 --> 00:23:14.320
<v Speaker 2>remind me the thesis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember it off?</v>

518
00:23:14.321 --> 00:23:15.154
<v Speaker 2>The idea is that we evolved in these </v>
<v Speaker 2>small tribes of people that essentially </v>

519
00:23:19.901 --> 00:23:22.510
<v Speaker 2>shared sexual partners.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's bullshit.</v>

520
00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:25.630
<v Speaker 2>And so the thing is that what makes you </v>
<v Speaker 2>say that so confidently?</v>

521
00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:26.980
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

522
00:23:26.981 --> 00:23:29.080
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't say quite so confidently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're absolutely right.</v>

523
00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:30.790
<v Speaker 2>I believe that's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How's that?</v>

524
00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:32.530
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do you believe that's bullshit?</v>

525
00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:33.483
<v Speaker 2>Because I'm so human beings have very </v>
<v Speaker 2>clear evolve jealousy systems and </v>

526
00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:42.070
<v Speaker 2>they're not just a product of the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we live in today.</v>

527
00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:44.860
<v Speaker 2>You can see jealousy among hunter </v>
<v Speaker 2>gatherers as well.</v>

528
00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:46.250
<v Speaker 2>Now the thing is they get jealous</v>

529
00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:47.083
<v Speaker 1>about different things because of course</v>
<v Speaker 1>men and women are slightly different </v>

530
00:23:48.651 --> 00:23:51.250
<v Speaker 1>pressure on them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they both get jealous by infidelity.</v>

531
00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:52.243
<v Speaker 1>Now that's not to say that the book is </v>
<v Speaker 1>incorrect about some societies in some </v>

532
00:23:55.641 --> 00:23:56.474
<v Speaker 1>places because one of the interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>things about humans is our flexibility </v>

533
00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:00.313
<v Speaker 1>and so you can create a system and some </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunter gatherers have where there's a </v>

534
00:24:03.171 --> 00:24:06.080
<v Speaker 1>lot of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a ton of that to some really interesting</v>

535
00:24:06.081 --> 00:24:08.810
<v Speaker 1>ones were literally once the woman gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>pregnant,</v>

536
00:24:08.811 --> 00:24:09.644
<v Speaker 1>she then starts to sleep with all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other males because she thinks her baby </v>

537
00:24:11.571 --> 00:24:14.140
<v Speaker 1>will gain the qualities of all the men </v>
<v Speaker 1>that she sleeps with.</v>

538
00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:14.983
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not trying to claim that we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>always monogamous Because absolutely </v>

539
00:24:17.931 --> 00:24:18.764
<v Speaker 1>that's untrue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do think that the dominant system </v>

540
00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:22.333
<v Speaker 1>is one of serial monogamy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason I think that that's the </v>

541
00:24:24.081 --> 00:24:24.914
<v Speaker 1>dominant system is this is kind of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>deal that we made whereby the males go </v>

542
00:24:29.481 --> 00:24:30.400
<v Speaker 1>out and do the hunting.</v>

543
00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:33.320
<v Speaker 1>The females go out and do gathering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's basically universal.</v>

544
00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:36.560
<v Speaker 1>She tends to cook for him And that comes</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to the fire point you made,</v>

545
00:24:36.561 --> 00:24:39.110
<v Speaker 1>which we can come back to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

546
00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:42.860
<v Speaker 1>and so they share resources and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's happy to share resources and do</v>

547
00:24:42.861 --> 00:24:44.930
<v Speaker 1>his best to kinda sorta look out for her</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids.</v>

548
00:24:44.931 --> 00:24:45.764
<v Speaker 1>I mean human males aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't take as much care as human </v>

549
00:24:48.021 --> 00:24:48.854
<v Speaker 1>females do have our kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're much better than the other </v>

550
00:24:50.811 --> 00:24:51.644
<v Speaker 1>great apes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that level of investment he's </v>

551
00:24:53.601 --> 00:24:54.434
<v Speaker 1>going to make his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tends to be to the degree that he </v>

552
00:24:55.821 --> 00:24:57.410
<v Speaker 1>believes that he's the father of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids.</v>

553
00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:58.513
<v Speaker 1>Now you have societies where he doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know that really all are polyamorous </v>

554
00:25:01.611 --> 00:25:02.444
<v Speaker 1>like that by all means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what percentage they are </v>

555
00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:06.920
<v Speaker 1>and it could even be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're more common than I believe,</v>

556
00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:08.143
<v Speaker 1>but when that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the systems tend to change a little bit </v>

557
00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:13.070
<v Speaker 1>and he's a little bit less willing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>look out,</v>

558
00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:14.113
<v Speaker 1>try to help out kids other than to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>her a favor unless the kid looks a lot </v>

559
00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:18.043
<v Speaker 1>like himself.</v>

560
00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:23.740
<v Speaker 3>Now what about why having a system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a biological system where jealousy comes</v>

561
00:25:26.661 --> 00:25:27.494
<v Speaker 3>up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What makes you think that that somehow </v>

562
00:25:29.961 --> 00:25:33.950
<v Speaker 3>or another negates the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 3>polyamorous relationships?</v>

563
00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:34.843
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it does suggest that they're not our </v>

564
00:25:36.141 --> 00:25:40.430
<v Speaker 3>default because it doesn't more likely </v>
<v Speaker 3>suggests that it encourages competition,</v>

565
00:25:40.431 --> 00:25:41.600
<v Speaker 3>which is just natural</v>

566
00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:44.310
<v Speaker 1>when we think about envy instead of </v>
<v Speaker 1>jealousy,</v>

567
00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:45.293
<v Speaker 1>and so if I'm jealous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm upset that my wife slept with </v>

568
00:25:48.181 --> 00:25:50.610
<v Speaker 1>somebody else last night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could be a low life.</v>

569
00:25:50.611 --> 00:25:53.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't envy a thing about him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want anything he owns,</v>

570
00:25:53.610 --> 00:25:55.550
<v Speaker 1>but I'm jealous of her behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm.</v>

571
00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:59.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm protective of what she's done and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a wonderful experiment.</v>

572
00:25:59.131 --> 00:26:01.360
<v Speaker 1>David buss has run at the university of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Texas stuff.</v>

573
00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:06.540
<v Speaker 3>They're jealous of the man as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not just jealous of her behavior.</v>

574
00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:07.443
<v Speaker 3>You're jealous of this other male that </v>
<v Speaker 3>gets to have sex with your wife and </v>

575
00:26:10.441 --> 00:26:11.274
<v Speaker 3>could not possibly encourage competition</v>
<v Speaker 3>and encourage men to be more aggressive </v>

576
00:26:16.231 --> 00:26:21.231
<v Speaker 3>or more ingenious or just create </v>
<v Speaker 3>encouraged creativity and courage,</v>

577
00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:26.220
<v Speaker 3>better hunting skills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you attract more women.</v>

578
00:26:26.221 --> 00:26:28.670
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all those things seem to control.</v>

579
00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:29.700
<v Speaker 3>YeaH,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would agree with all that.</v>

580
00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:30.613
<v Speaker 1>I phrased it a little bit differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's this wonderful study out of </v>

581
00:26:32.571 --> 00:26:33.404
<v Speaker 1>the Philippines where they measured </v>
<v Speaker 1>men's huge number of men's testosterone </v>

582
00:26:36.621 --> 00:26:40.100
<v Speaker 1>when they were single and then they </v>
<v Speaker 1>waited a few years and measured it again</v>

583
00:26:40.101 --> 00:26:40.934
<v Speaker 1>after they were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were still single or now they're </v>

584
00:26:42.081 --> 00:26:42.914
<v Speaker 1>married and now they're married and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>have kids and I'm sure it wasn't a </v>

585
00:26:46.351 --> 00:26:48.120
<v Speaker 1>psychology study because we can't afford</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do that.</v>

586
00:26:48.121 --> 00:26:48.954
<v Speaker 1>It was probably some medical thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they used to to answer this </v>

587
00:26:51.361 --> 00:26:53.340
<v Speaker 1>interesting psychological question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which what's have,</v>

588
00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:54.323
<v Speaker 1>who's most likely to get the girl by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>original testosterone levels and what </v>

589
00:26:57.001 --> 00:26:58.710
<v Speaker 1>happens when you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

590
00:26:58.980 --> 00:26:59.813
<v Speaker 1>the guys who got married in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>intervening few years had higher </v>

591
00:27:03.121 --> 00:27:05.310
<v Speaker 1>testosterone than the guys who didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

592
00:27:05.311 --> 00:27:06.144
<v Speaker 1>you're absolutely right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're out there competing with other </v>

593
00:27:07.651 --> 00:27:11.250
<v Speaker 1>males in order to get the girl and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's lots and lots of goes on there.</v>

594
00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:12.083
<v Speaker 1>Tons of really interesting things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what's interesting is once we get </v>

595
00:27:14.101 --> 00:27:17.670
<v Speaker 1>the girl are testosterone drops and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>if we.</v>

596
00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:21.450
<v Speaker 1>Once we partner up and if we're in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>monogamous relationship,</v>

597
00:27:21.451 --> 00:27:23.610
<v Speaker 1>not polyamorous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in a monogamous relationship,</v>

598
00:27:23.611 --> 00:27:25.920
<v Speaker 1>our testosterone drops and then it drops</v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

599
00:27:25.921 --> 00:27:26.754
<v Speaker 1>If we have kids and testosterone is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>great hormone for getting out there and </v>

600
00:27:30.061 --> 00:27:30.894
<v Speaker 1>being competitive with other guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a great hormone for being </v>

601
00:27:33.181 --> 00:27:34.014
<v Speaker 1>nurturing for your children and it's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>a great hormone for being faithful to </v>

602
00:27:36.631 --> 00:27:37.464
<v Speaker 1>your partner and so I think that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolved to compete with other males in </v>

603
00:27:40.621 --> 00:27:44.700
<v Speaker 1>order to get into the mating game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you look at our ancestral dna,</v>

604
00:27:44.701 --> 00:27:45.534
<v Speaker 1>you know how you can track our male and </v>
<v Speaker 1>female ancestry through mitochondrial </v>

605
00:27:48.361 --> 00:27:49.194
<v Speaker 1>dna in the mother's side and why you'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>see that we have far more female </v>

606
00:27:51.511 --> 00:27:54.390
<v Speaker 1>ancestors than male,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not quite two to one,</v>

607
00:27:54.391 --> 00:27:56.700
<v Speaker 1>But I think it's close to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what does that tell us?</v>

608
00:27:56.701 --> 00:27:58.710
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of guys are getting left out of the</v>

609
00:27:58.711 --> 00:28:01.350
<v Speaker 1>mating game entirely and lots of guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>are inseminating,</v>

610
00:28:01.351 --> 00:28:02.184
<v Speaker 1>lots of different women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all those things that you said are </v>

611
00:28:03.391 --> 00:28:06.630
<v Speaker 1>absolutely true and all that pushes us </v>
<v Speaker 1>for competition,</v>

612
00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:10.710
<v Speaker 1>but part of what I believe goes on as </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of that competition that we engaged</v>

613
00:28:10.711 --> 00:28:11.544
<v Speaker 1>in was in order to get the girl to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>into that relationship in the first </v>

614
00:28:14.011 --> 00:28:14.760
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

615
00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:15.593
<v Speaker 3>Could I stop you there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I think that if you're going to </v>

616
00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:22.820
<v Speaker 3>have a study on testosterone and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to have a study on lifestyle,</v>

617
00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:24.173
<v Speaker 3>I mean you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you get married and you have </v>

618
00:28:26.101 --> 00:28:26.934
<v Speaker 3>children,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that happens is you </v>

619
00:28:27.841 --> 00:28:29.310
<v Speaker 3>become less active.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd be,</v>

620
00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:31.920
<v Speaker 3>you don't exercise as much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't sleep as much.</v>

621
00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:35.280
<v Speaker 3>All those things have a pretty radical </v>
<v Speaker 3>effect on hormone production.</v>

622
00:28:35.370 --> 00:28:37.050
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it could well be that,</v>

623
00:28:37.051 --> 00:28:37.884
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you always have to have a proximal </v>

624
00:28:38.521 --> 00:28:40.680
<v Speaker 1>mechanism whereby evolution plays its </v>
<v Speaker 1>game,</v>

625
00:28:40.681 --> 00:28:44.130
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the distal cause is as,</v>

626
00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:44.973
<v Speaker 1>as an evolved species where testosterone</v>
<v Speaker 1>is super important to get us into the </v>

627
00:28:47.881 --> 00:28:50.460
<v Speaker 1>mating game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's less useful once we're in it.</v>

628
00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:51.980
<v Speaker 1>Well all you could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could,</v>

629
00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:52.833
<v Speaker 1>all you have to do is have a system </v>
<v Speaker 1>whereby those things tend to </v>

630
00:28:54.361 --> 00:28:56.430
<v Speaker 1>downregulate testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly like you said,</v>

631
00:28:56.610 --> 00:29:00.060
<v Speaker 1>because you know those things are gonna </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen once you get partnered up and so.</v>

632
00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:02.070
<v Speaker 1>But mind you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when our ancestors partnered up,</v>

633
00:29:02.071 --> 00:29:03.890
<v Speaker 1>they're still out hunting every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

634
00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:04.733
<v Speaker 1>we may be right.</v>

635
00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:06.960
<v Speaker 3>You don't have Studies on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unfortunately we don't.</v>

636
00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:12.200
<v Speaker 3>The issue is that I'm having with this </v>
<v Speaker 3>is we have studies on the general health</v>

637
00:29:12.931 --> 00:29:16.290
<v Speaker 3>and testosterone and hormonal health of </v>
<v Speaker 3>sedentary humans.</v>

638
00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:17.173
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I would like to know what their </v>

639
00:29:18.421 --> 00:29:20.640
<v Speaker 3>lifestyle is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would like to know what they're doing.</v>

640
00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:21.863
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure that seem to make any sense to </v>
<v Speaker 3>me because one thing that everybody </v>

641
00:29:24.451 --> 00:29:27.060
<v Speaker 3>knows is that you get dad bod,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

642
00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:28.950
<v Speaker 3>That's dad by what his dad bought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dad.</v>

643
00:29:28.951 --> 00:29:30.660
<v Speaker 3>Bob's a guy who works all day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>comes home,</v>

644
00:29:30.661 --> 00:29:33.180
<v Speaker 3>sits on the couch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably eats food.</v>

645
00:29:33.181 --> 00:29:35.700
<v Speaker 3>You probably shouldn't eat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hangs out with his kids,</v>

646
00:29:35.701 --> 00:29:37.680
<v Speaker 3>doesn't get a whole lot of exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>works,</v>

647
00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:39.570
<v Speaker 3>probably doesn't sleep as much as he </v>
<v Speaker 3>should.</v>

648
00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:42.220
<v Speaker 3>That.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's to me,</v>

649
00:29:42.221 --> 00:29:45.850
<v Speaker 3>that's a symptom of poor health and </v>
<v Speaker 3>fitness.</v>

650
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.920
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's not a symptom or ancestors ever</v>

651
00:29:47.921 --> 00:29:48.730
<v Speaker 1>experienced.</v>

652
00:29:48.730 --> 00:29:51.370
<v Speaker 3>Not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is not necessarily an indication of</v>

653
00:29:51.371 --> 00:29:52.204
<v Speaker 3>any sort of evolutionary benefit of </v>
<v Speaker 3>having low testosterone because we've </v>

654
00:29:56.171 --> 00:29:57.004
<v Speaker 3>demonstrated for sure that when people </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't get sleep and when they don't get </v>

655
00:30:00.851 --> 00:30:02.800
<v Speaker 3>exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their testosterone drops.</v>

656
00:30:02.801 --> 00:30:03.634
<v Speaker 3>So those are two things that absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen when you get married and have </v>

657
00:30:04.931 --> 00:30:05.400
<v Speaker 3>children.</v>

658
00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:06.233
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the only thing I would say is the </v>

659
00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:12.250
<v Speaker 1>times of the time span of this study was</v>
<v Speaker 1>only over a few years and let's see.</v>

660
00:30:12.330 --> 00:30:13.163
<v Speaker 3>The worst thing about having this kind </v>
<v Speaker 3>of a study and making these kinds of </v>

661
00:30:16.590 --> 00:30:20.490
<v Speaker 3>kind of conclusions based on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we see,</v>

662
00:30:20.491 --> 00:30:21.324
<v Speaker 3>we know these mechanisms are in place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we already know that there's natural </v>

663
00:30:24.541 --> 00:30:27.750
<v Speaker 3>effects of sedentary lifestyle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lack of sleep,</v>

664
00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:32.370
<v Speaker 3>and the effects are your hormone </v>
<v Speaker 3>production drops,</v>

665
00:30:32.371 --> 00:30:34.290
<v Speaker 3>your body suffers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you become less healthy.</v>

666
00:30:34.291 --> 00:30:37.860
<v Speaker 3>And this is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is not indicating monogamy,</v>

667
00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:38.993
<v Speaker 3>this is just indicating poor health.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is not like an evolutionary </v>

668
00:30:42.030 --> 00:30:45.870
<v Speaker 3>advantage to having low testosterone </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it helps you raise children.</v>

669
00:30:45.871 --> 00:30:46.704
<v Speaker 3>You can have high testosterone is still </v>
<v Speaker 3>be a good dad and raise children and </v>

670
00:30:49.621 --> 00:30:50.620
<v Speaker 3>still have friends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That theme,</v>

671
00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:52.490
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of these things are bell curves,</v>

672
00:30:52.491 --> 00:30:53.750
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The higher you are,</v>

673
00:30:53.751 --> 00:30:54.584
<v Speaker 1>the harder it gets.</v>

674
00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:59.180
<v Speaker 3>Part of the problem I'm having iS,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is drawing conclusions on this one study</v>

675
00:30:59.181 --> 00:31:00.800
<v Speaker 3>and stating them as if they're facts.</v>

676
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:01.833
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're absolutely right.</v>

677
00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:03.090
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I say it's a fact,</v>

678
00:31:03.091 --> 00:31:06.220
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly overstated because we </v>
<v Speaker 1>only know the problem with almost all of</v>

679
00:31:06.221 --> 00:31:07.810
<v Speaker 1>our studies is the exact one you pointed</v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

680
00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:10.260
<v Speaker 1>We've got them on us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't have.</v>

681
00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:12.970
<v Speaker 1>So like the sex studies are a perfect </v>
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>

682
00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:15.730
<v Speaker 1>Like things like female orgasm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What role does it play?</v>

683
00:31:15.910 --> 00:31:16.743
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need really good data on hunter </v>

684
00:31:17.651 --> 00:31:19.450
<v Speaker 1>gatherers to know the answer to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>

685
00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:21.970
<v Speaker 1>If you look at hunter gatherers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have dad bod,</v>

686
00:31:21.971 --> 00:31:22.804
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all running and whether their </v>

687
00:31:24.311 --> 00:31:25.144
<v Speaker 1>fathers are not because they're out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there hunting every day or gathering </v>

688
00:31:27.131 --> 00:31:28.450
<v Speaker 1>everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very physically active.</v>

689
00:31:28.451 --> 00:31:30.160
<v Speaker 1>So if I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I oversold that,</v>

690
00:31:30.161 --> 00:31:31.420
<v Speaker 1>my apologies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you're absolutely right.</v>

691
00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:33.880
<v Speaker 1>I suspect though that you'd find the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>

692
00:31:33.881 --> 00:31:36.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't know it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all we got right now,</v>

693
00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:38.560
<v Speaker 1>but how can you suspect it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it just,</v>

694
00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:41.080
<v Speaker 1>there's no data,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no data.</v>

695
00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:42.180
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you look</v>

696
00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:46.010
<v Speaker 3>these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a friend of mine who he was,</v>

697
00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:47.990
<v Speaker 3>was it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how'd you say the name?</v>

698
00:31:47.991 --> 00:31:51.380
<v Speaker 3>The yanomami in Bolivia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bolivia.</v>

699
00:31:51.390 --> 00:31:52.940
<v Speaker 3>Whether in Venezuela,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brazil.</v>

700
00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:55.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he spent some time with them and you</v>

701
00:31:55.850 --> 00:31:57.810
<v Speaker 3>see these people and the lifestyle they </v>
<v Speaker 3>live,</v>

702
00:31:57.811 --> 00:32:00.050
<v Speaker 3>they're all barefoot wandering through </v>
<v Speaker 3>the jungle.</v>

703
00:32:00.051 --> 00:32:00.884
<v Speaker 3>They have these crazy looking feet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether their toes splay out because </v>

704
00:32:04.131 --> 00:32:06.620
<v Speaker 3>they're just constantly gripping the </v>
<v Speaker 3>floor with their toes when they probably</v>

705
00:32:06.621 --> 00:32:08.000
<v Speaker 3>could choke you with me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

706
00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:12.020
<v Speaker 3>and these people just look so fit and </v>
<v Speaker 3>healthy in their,</v>

707
00:32:12.290 --> 00:32:14.510
<v Speaker 3>in their fifties and sixties and </v>
<v Speaker 3>seventies.</v>

708
00:32:14.511 --> 00:32:16.070
<v Speaker 3>And they have their shirt off and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're ripped.</v>

709
00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:17.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're super fit.</v>

710
00:32:17.390 --> 00:32:19.630
<v Speaker 1>Same holds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the hubs in Tanzania,</v>

711
00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:20.563
<v Speaker 1>any of these groups,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the yanomamo are interesting because </v>

712
00:32:22.101 --> 00:32:22.934
<v Speaker 1>they're a hunter horticulturalist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're actually doing a little bit </v>

713
00:32:24.591 --> 00:32:25.424
<v Speaker 1>of gardening as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they're ripped and strong and they </v>

714
00:32:27.651 --> 00:32:28.484
<v Speaker 1>don't have obesity problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so all I would say is That the same </v>

715
00:32:32.001 --> 00:32:34.490
<v Speaker 1>thing holds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one thing that we found in humans in</v>

716
00:32:34.491 --> 00:32:38.210
<v Speaker 1>our modern culture where we have these </v>
<v Speaker 1>data is if you're married and have kids,</v>

717
00:32:38.211 --> 00:32:39.044
<v Speaker 1>but you're still looking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your tea hasn't gone down as much that </v>

718
00:32:41.330 --> 00:32:42.163
<v Speaker 1>you're going to point out quite rightly </v>
<v Speaker 1>that well maybe that's a different kind </v>

719
00:32:44.271 --> 00:32:47.000
<v Speaker 1>of person than the person who marries </v>
<v Speaker 1>and isn't looking around,</v>

720
00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:48.283
<v Speaker 1>and so it's all confounded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super hard to do experiments on these </v>

721
00:32:50.841 --> 00:32:53.240
<v Speaker 1>things and we'll be a lot better off </v>
<v Speaker 1>when we've got,</v>

722
00:32:53.410 --> 00:32:55.460
<v Speaker 1>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're losing the world's last hunter.</v>

723
00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:59.660
<v Speaker 1>Gatherers are disappearing and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>easy to collect these kinds of data,</v>

724
00:32:59.661 --> 00:33:00.494
<v Speaker 1>but they're doing lots of genetic work </v>
<v Speaker 1>with these people right now all over </v>

725
00:33:02.901 --> 00:33:04.230
<v Speaker 1>africa because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's.</v>

726
00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:09.290
<v Speaker 1>We've got tons of genetic data now on </v>
<v Speaker 1>european descent and east asian descent,</v>

727
00:33:09.291 --> 00:33:10.124
<v Speaker 1>but almost none on africans and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a huge project underway and so </v>

728
00:33:13.161 --> 00:33:13.994
<v Speaker 1>for all I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're working on hormones and other </v>

729
00:33:15.291 --> 00:33:16.580
<v Speaker 1>things as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

730
00:33:16.581 --> 00:33:20.360
<v Speaker 1>That's the reason why I'm asking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is you.</v>

731
00:33:20.361 --> 00:33:25.361
<v Speaker 1>You were so readily dismissing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were so willing to dismiss that,</v>

732
00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:28.480
<v Speaker 1>but yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

733
00:33:28.490 --> 00:33:29.323
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the facts that are laid out as </v>

734
00:33:30.951 --> 00:33:33.250
<v Speaker 1>facts in the book don't really hold up </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm in.</v>

735
00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:36.320
<v Speaker 1>I wish I'd read it more recently and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>I could go through the details with you.</v>

736
00:33:36.321 --> 00:33:37.154
<v Speaker 1>There's some really good reviews by </v>
<v Speaker 1>anthropologists and by people who work </v>

737
00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:41.060
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

738
00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:42.710
<v Speaker 1>sexual studies and stuff like that.</v>

739
00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:44.980
<v Speaker 1>Going through the details.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We read it as a,</v>

740
00:33:45.170 --> 00:33:46.003
<v Speaker 1>we haven't this evolutionary center </v>
<v Speaker 1>center for psychology and evolution and </v>

741
00:33:48.651 --> 00:33:51.740
<v Speaker 1>we read it and went through it and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't convinced.</v>

742
00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:54.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm embarrassed to admit I can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember the details of.</v>

743
00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:56.360
<v Speaker 1>Chris is a very smart guy and he's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good friend of mine.</v>

744
00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:58.520
<v Speaker 1>also a great book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a great book.</v>

745
00:33:58.521 --> 00:34:00.560
<v Speaker 1>I would love to see him debate one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those folks.</v>

746
00:34:00.561 --> 00:34:02.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure he probably has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He probably has.</v>

747
00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:03.493
<v Speaker 1>And look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that all these things that we're </v>

748
00:34:05.451 --> 00:34:06.950
<v Speaker 1>talking about are heavily debated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

749
00:34:06.951 --> 00:34:07.784
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my colleague rob brooks is a </v>

750
00:34:08.871 --> 00:34:11.450
<v Speaker 1>wonderful evolutionary biologists and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia loves that book.</v>

751
00:34:11.810 --> 00:34:15.500
<v Speaker 1>So the fact that I think it's bullshit </v>
<v Speaker 1>is obviously one person's opinion.</v>

752
00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:17.480
<v Speaker 1>Where I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dismissed that argument.</v>

753
00:34:17.481 --> 00:34:18.500
<v Speaker 1>Other people might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well look,</v>

754
00:34:18.501 --> 00:34:19.334
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of cultures that they do </v>
<v Speaker 1>have much more like the system I told </v>

755
00:34:22.011 --> 00:34:24.460
<v Speaker 1>you about where they have sex with lots </v>
<v Speaker 1>of men after they have their baby.</v>

756
00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:27.710
<v Speaker 1>Humans are so flexible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can do all those things.</v>

757
00:34:27.711 --> 00:34:29.630
<v Speaker 1>we just changed the nature of how we do </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

758
00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:34.850
<v Speaker 1>The social leap that I'm arguing about </v>
<v Speaker 1>is not this pair bonding thing.</v>

759
00:34:35.090 --> 00:34:37.910
<v Speaker 1>It's about how our groups came together </v>
<v Speaker 1>to engage in collective action.</v>

760
00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:40.370
<v Speaker 1>so in principle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm agnostic on this issue.</v>

761
00:34:40.371 --> 00:34:43.100
<v Speaker 1>I just happen to disagree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I happen to feel like no,</v>

762
00:34:43.101 --> 00:34:45.920
<v Speaker 1>I think we made these deals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so to come back to the study,</v>

763
00:34:45.950 --> 00:34:48.710
<v Speaker 1>the david buss did that I started to </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell you about.</v>

764
00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:50.480
<v Speaker 1>So bas has this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

765
00:34:51.410 --> 00:34:52.940
<v Speaker 1>he's got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he came along,</v>

766
00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:54.193
<v Speaker 1>people thought that the two sexes had </v>
<v Speaker 1>similar levels of jealousy for </v>

767
00:34:56.781 --> 00:34:58.430
<v Speaker 1>infidelity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And david was like,</v>

768
00:34:58.431 --> 00:35:00.260
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looks inseminations internal.</v>

769
00:35:00.530 --> 00:35:01.363
<v Speaker 1>And so men should be a lot more worried </v>
<v Speaker 1>about her sleeping with somebody else </v>

770
00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:06.913
<v Speaker 1>than women should be because he.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Men never know for sure if they're the </v>

771
00:35:08.961 --> 00:35:10.490
<v Speaker 1>father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't see it happen.</v>

772
00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:11.601
<v Speaker 1>Whereas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

773
00:35:11.601 --> 00:35:12.710
<v Speaker 1>if you're a salmon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can say,</v>

774
00:35:12.711 --> 00:35:13.341
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the debt,</v>

775
00:35:13.341 --> 00:35:15.200
<v Speaker 1>I just watched that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

776
00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:18.710
<v Speaker 1>females inseminations turn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they know they're the mother.</v>

777
00:35:18.711 --> 00:35:19.544
<v Speaker 1>That's not their concern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They should be more concerned about </v>

778
00:35:21.111 --> 00:35:21.944
<v Speaker 1>things like his given her resources to </v>
<v Speaker 1>help her raise the kids and things like </v>

779
00:35:25.521 --> 00:35:26.354
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what bus found is if you ask </v>

780
00:35:28.431 --> 00:35:30.680
<v Speaker 1>people this question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would bother you more?</v>

781
00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:34.430
<v Speaker 1>Imagine your wife having sex with </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody that she just met for the first</v>

782
00:35:34.431 --> 00:35:35.264
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having this great time and doing all </v>

783
00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:39.690
<v Speaker 1>these different things with them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then never doing it again.</v>

784
00:35:40.110 --> 00:35:42.530
<v Speaker 1>Or your wife develops this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

785
00:35:42.570 --> 00:35:44.730
<v Speaker 1>ongoing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional connection with somebody.</v>

786
00:35:44.731 --> 00:35:46.590
<v Speaker 1>She never touched him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He never touches her,</v>

787
00:35:46.830 --> 00:35:49.920
<v Speaker 1>but they talk and have shared their </v>
<v Speaker 1>feelings and stared deep in each other's</v>

788
00:35:49.921 --> 00:35:51.390
<v Speaker 1>eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would bother you more?</v>

789
00:35:51.391 --> 00:35:54.300
<v Speaker 1>And you ask men and women that question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what would,</v>

790
00:35:54.301 --> 00:35:55.134
<v Speaker 1>in your case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would bother you to have your wife </v>

791
00:35:56.191 --> 00:35:58.500
<v Speaker 1>to know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She had this one off a fair fling.</v>

792
00:35:59.100 --> 00:35:59.933
<v Speaker 1>Sex only didn't care about the guy or </v>
<v Speaker 1>she develops a sort of emotional bond </v>

793
00:36:02.971 --> 00:36:04.590
<v Speaker 1>with somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never touches it.</v>

794
00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:08.620
<v Speaker 4>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd really have to think about that.</v>

795
00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:10.750
<v Speaker 4>It's not an easy one because nobody </v>
<v Speaker 4>likes either of them.</v>

796
00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:12.040
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

797
00:36:12.210 --> 00:36:15.610
<v Speaker 4>because it's a matter of time for that </v>
<v Speaker 4>dude gets in.</v>

798
00:36:15.611 --> 00:36:16.444
<v Speaker 4>That's a no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The guarantee in this case is the </v>

799
00:36:19.001 --> 00:36:20.920
<v Speaker 4>guarantee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a guarantee that they never,</v>

800
00:36:20.970 --> 00:36:21.850
<v Speaker 4>never touched.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Never.</v>

801
00:36:21.890 --> 00:36:23.470
<v Speaker 4>As long as he doesn't talk shit about </v>
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>

802
00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:25.090
<v Speaker 4>That's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those guys,</v>

803
00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:29.200
<v Speaker 4>they started the pool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would do so much better.</v>

804
00:36:31.010 --> 00:36:31.481
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

805
00:36:31.481 --> 00:36:32.500
<v Speaker 4>here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Weasels,</v>

806
00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:36.280
<v Speaker 4>on average,</v>
<v Speaker 4>men are more bothered by sex.</v>

807
00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:39.720
<v Speaker 4>The one off sex and women are more </v>
<v Speaker 4>bothered by the emotional,</v>

808
00:36:39.790 --> 00:36:44.020
<v Speaker 4>emotional connection because connection </v>
<v Speaker 4>could lead to him leaving her.</v>

809
00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:44.953
<v Speaker 1>Well also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's him leaving her directing his </v>

810
00:36:46.791 --> 00:36:49.280
<v Speaker 1>resources elsewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's,</v>

811
00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:50.173
<v Speaker 1>it's mind you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every time we talk about gender </v>

812
00:36:51.321 --> 00:36:52.940
<v Speaker 1>differences is super important to keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>in mind.</v>

813
00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:53.783
<v Speaker 1>They're heavily overlapping bell curves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's never 100 percent this way and </v>

814
00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:58.670
<v Speaker 1>except like do you have this Oregon or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something?</v>

815
00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:01.430
<v Speaker 1>But psychologically it's always </v>
<v Speaker 1>overlapping,</v>

816
00:37:01.431 --> 00:37:04.970
<v Speaker 1>but on this is a big effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Men on average are much more bothered by</v>

817
00:37:04.971 --> 00:37:07.490
<v Speaker 1>the one off sex and women on average are</v>
<v Speaker 1>much more</v>

818
00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:10.600
<v Speaker 4>bothered by the emotional connection.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

819
00:37:10.601 --> 00:37:11.434
<v Speaker 4>that's fascinating because I was reading</v>
<v Speaker 4>something about inappropriate emotional </v>

820
00:37:14.501 --> 00:37:15.334
<v Speaker 4>relationships that people have at work </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that this is an issue with people </v>

821
00:37:19.691 --> 00:37:20.524
<v Speaker 4>that work together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They develop these office friendships </v>

822
00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:29.440
<v Speaker 4>that lead to inappropriate emotional </v>
<v Speaker 4>relationships and I was like,</v>

823
00:37:29.441 --> 00:37:30.274
<v Speaker 4>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a,</v>

824
00:37:31.050 --> 00:37:31.883
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never worked in an office so I'm </v>

825
00:37:33.341 --> 00:37:35.170
<v Speaker 4>listening to this or reading this </v>
<v Speaker 4>rather.</v>

826
00:37:35.171 --> 00:37:37.720
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what a strange world that is.</v>

827
00:37:38.110 --> 00:37:39.280
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get it though.</v>

828
00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:40.353
<v Speaker 4>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if there's a guy and he's married </v>

829
00:37:42.141 --> 00:37:42.974
<v Speaker 4>and a gal and she's married,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they meet at work and they stare in </v>

830
00:37:44.831 --> 00:37:45.664
<v Speaker 4>each other's eyes all day and they go to</v>
<v Speaker 4>lunch and maybe they even hold hands </v>

831
00:37:49.061 --> 00:37:50.020
<v Speaker 4>every now and then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

832
00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:52.990
<v Speaker 4>they become.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's where it crosses the line.</v>

833
00:37:52.991 --> 00:37:55.120
<v Speaker 4>Like you're allowed to hug people when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you hold hands.</v>

834
00:37:55.121 --> 00:37:56.920
<v Speaker 4>That's fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's tense.</v>

835
00:37:57.160 --> 00:37:58.330
<v Speaker 4>That skin to skin.</v>

836
00:37:58.690 --> 00:37:59.523
<v Speaker 1>It is serious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to concern you if you're a </v>

837
00:38:02.171 --> 00:38:03.004
<v Speaker 1>partner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what's also going to concern you as </v>

838
00:38:04.751 --> 00:38:06.400
<v Speaker 1>a mere fact that you see this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

839
00:38:06.401 --> 00:38:08.290
<v Speaker 1>this deep conversation happening and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

840
00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:12.190
<v Speaker 1>because think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we evolve to basically partner up for</v>

841
00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:13.033
<v Speaker 1>awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there's always going to be the </v>

842
00:38:14.621 --> 00:38:15.454
<v Speaker 1>chance that that next person long it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna be the one which is years away </v>

843
00:38:17.470 --> 00:38:18.303
<v Speaker 1>serial monogamy and both males and </v>
<v Speaker 1>females gain from not putting all their </v>

844
00:38:21.641 --> 00:38:24.520
<v Speaker 1>eggs into the same genetic basket.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if my.</v>

845
00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:26.230
<v Speaker 1>If my wife partners up with you for </v>
<v Speaker 1>awhile,</v>

846
00:38:26.350 --> 00:38:29.500
<v Speaker 1>she'll get a certain kind of offspring </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then maybe that'll be a great thing,</v>

847
00:38:29.501 --> 00:38:34.240
<v Speaker 1>but maybe when the situation changes or </v>
<v Speaker 1>the in tomorrow's world,</v>

848
00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:36.160
<v Speaker 1>some smaller guy would be handy</v>

849
00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:39.220
<v Speaker 2>in some way and so maybe she's better </v>
<v Speaker 2>off partnering with me next.</v>

850
00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:40.180
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

851
00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:43.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is fascinating when you break it down</v>

852
00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:44.263
<v Speaker 3>that it really does become.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a biological reason for these </v>

853
00:38:49.151 --> 00:38:49.984
<v Speaker 3>behaviors and these are the motivation </v>
<v Speaker 3>for the jealousy and all these things </v>

854
00:38:54.011 --> 00:38:54.844
<v Speaker 3>that there's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a history of biological history </v>

855
00:38:56.801 --> 00:38:57.280
<v Speaker 3>to all this</v>

856
00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:58.113
<v Speaker 2>stuff and we don't know what hunter </v>
<v Speaker 2>gathers how they would answer that </v>

857
00:39:00.741 --> 00:39:01.574
<v Speaker 2>question so we can only just assuming </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the answer we're providing is </v>

858
00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:06.140
<v Speaker 2>general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for me,</v>

859
00:39:06.141 --> 00:39:08.920
<v Speaker 2>those kinds of things suggests that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolved.</v>

860
00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:09.763
<v Speaker 2>We evolved in a lot of longterm </v>
<v Speaker 2>monogamous circumstances that may have </v>

861
00:39:12.831 --> 00:39:14.810
<v Speaker 2>been serial and there was certainly </v>
<v Speaker 2>fooling around,</v>

862
00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:15.853
<v Speaker 2>but if we were polyamorous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the book says we'd have bigger </v>

863
00:39:18.261 --> 00:39:21.050
<v Speaker 2>balls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are balls are so big though,</v>

864
00:39:21.110 --> 00:39:22.430
<v Speaker 2>compared to a chimp there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Small.</v>

865
00:39:22.490 --> 00:39:24.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But chimps are.</v>

866
00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:25.820
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything's big with them.</v>

867
00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:26.601
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

868
00:39:26.601 --> 00:39:29.720
<v Speaker 2>Our penis is way bigger than theirs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got a tiny little.</v>

869
00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:32.690
<v Speaker 2>They have large.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Paul's smaller penises.</v>

870
00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:34.280
<v Speaker 2>Puppets would probably get in the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

871
00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:35.510
<v Speaker 2>When though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing about,</v>

872
00:39:35.530 --> 00:39:36.363
<v Speaker 2>so human beings copulate for an </v>
<v Speaker 2>extraordinarily long period of time and </v>

873
00:39:39.870 --> 00:39:41.570
<v Speaker 2>we also have this cryptic ovulation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

874
00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:43.340
<v Speaker 2>where she's not showing you that she's </v>
<v Speaker 2>in heat,</v>

875
00:39:43.730 --> 00:39:44.563
<v Speaker 2>so mail chimp's aren't interested unless</v>
<v Speaker 2>she has an enormous swelling on her </v>

876
00:39:48.381 --> 00:39:49.910
<v Speaker 2>vagina and then they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

877
00:39:49.911 --> 00:39:51.080
<v Speaker 2>that's super attractive to me.</v>

878
00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:51.933
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say,</v>

879
00:39:51.950 --> 00:39:53.580
<v Speaker 2>but what about banabos?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because they,</v>

880
00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:54.463
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do this funky sex thing all the </v>

881
00:39:55.371 --> 00:39:56.204
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

882
00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:57.171
<v Speaker 2>Have fun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

883
00:39:57.171 --> 00:39:58.004
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're all sorts of funky orgiastic </v>

884
00:40:00.261 --> 00:40:01.270
<v Speaker 2>kinds of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We used,</v>

885
00:40:01.271 --> 00:40:02.104
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I taught at Ohio state university </v>

886
00:40:04.071 --> 00:40:04.904
<v Speaker 2>that the zoo there has a great exhibit </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you bring your kids through and </v>

887
00:40:07.731 --> 00:40:09.950
<v Speaker 2>there's a series orgy going on and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>kids are like,</v>

888
00:40:09.951 --> 00:40:11.930
<v Speaker 2>came out and she said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

889
00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:13.700
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of zoos that won't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Novos,</v>

890
00:40:13.730 --> 00:40:14.563
<v Speaker 2>because they're pretty interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the thing is that those kinds of </v>

891
00:40:18.471 --> 00:40:20.300
<v Speaker 2>things just show you that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>complicated,</v>

892
00:40:20.301 --> 00:40:21.134
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any kind of straightforward answer that </v>

893
00:40:22.910 --> 00:40:25.020
<v Speaker 2>it's going to have some wrinkles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

894
00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:27.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I apologize if I get some earlier.</v>

895
00:40:27.021 --> 00:40:28.430
<v Speaker 2>No worries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so anyway,</v>

896
00:40:28.431 --> 00:40:31.520
<v Speaker 2>the um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the but back to this issue.</v>

897
00:40:31.521 --> 00:40:35.750
<v Speaker 2>So if we had a total bonobo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chimp kind of system,</v>

898
00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:38.660
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we had evolved those </v>
<v Speaker 2>systems of jealousy because what's,</v>

899
00:40:38.661 --> 00:40:41.120
<v Speaker 2>what's to be gained by that we're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>making these longterm partners.</v>

900
00:40:41.121 --> 00:40:42.650
<v Speaker 2>Why would you get these differences?</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

901
00:40:42.651 --> 00:40:43.484
<v Speaker 2>whenever I bring chris's book up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to defend it because it has </v>

902
00:40:45.951 --> 00:40:47.660
<v Speaker 2>happened a couple times in the last </v>
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>

903
00:40:48.130 --> 00:40:48.963
<v Speaker 2>I haven't read it and at least two years</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd have to go back and I read it back </v>

904
00:40:52.641 --> 00:40:54.680
<v Speaker 2>over five years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but someone who came out,</v>

905
00:40:54.790 --> 00:40:55.623
<v Speaker 3>when my friend's wife got ahold of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my friend got it and my friend's wife </v>

906
00:41:00.371 --> 00:41:01.204
<v Speaker 3>got all of it</v>

907
00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:04.770
<v Speaker 2>to a right in the trash.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She read like a paragraph or two and she</v>

908
00:41:04.771 --> 00:41:05.980
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck this book.</v>

909
00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:10.540
<v Speaker 2>A lot of women react that way and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't remember why.</v>

910
00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:11.381
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>

911
00:41:11.381 --> 00:41:12.580
<v Speaker 2>I just don't have it loaded up.</v>

912
00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:14.220
<v Speaker 3>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

913
00:41:14.310 --> 00:41:15.143
<v Speaker 3>so when these chimp,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like creatures from millions of years </v>

914
00:41:19.050 --> 00:41:19.883
<v Speaker 3>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>slowly started walking upright and </v>

915
00:41:22.050 --> 00:41:26.970
<v Speaker 3>started moving into the grasslands and </v>
<v Speaker 3>making,</v>

916
00:41:27.030 --> 00:41:30.930
<v Speaker 3>making experiments and traveling away </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the jungle.</v>

917
00:41:31.950 --> 00:41:32.783
<v Speaker 3>And this coincided the development of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the throwing arm and this could because </v>

918
00:41:37.281 --> 00:41:40.760
<v Speaker 3>they started walking upright.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When did this,</v>

919
00:41:40.970 --> 00:41:42.140
<v Speaker 3>when did the cooked meat</v>

920
00:41:43.050 --> 00:41:44.970
<v Speaker 1>come along?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they don't control fire.</v>

921
00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.160
<v Speaker 1>so also can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now we go forward.</v>

922
00:41:47.161 --> 00:41:49.380
<v Speaker 1>We're now about three and a half million</v>
<v Speaker 1>yearS ago.</v>

923
00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:50.393
<v Speaker 1>You got to now go forward to about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little less than 2 million years ago to </v>

924
00:41:53.431 --> 00:41:56.460
<v Speaker 1>get to homo erectus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So once we get to homo erectus,</v>

925
00:41:56.610 --> 00:41:57.990
<v Speaker 1>we now got an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

926
00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:00.780
<v Speaker 1>an ancestor that literally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it went to the z,</v>

927
00:42:00.781 --> 00:42:02.610
<v Speaker 1>you'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's a kind of rough hewn guy,</v>

928
00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:03.653
<v Speaker 1>but you think it's a person and not </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody who bought belongs behind the </v>

929
00:42:05.671 --> 00:42:06.910
<v Speaker 1>glass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

930
00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:07.783
<v Speaker 1>so a chimp brain is three 80 </v>
<v Speaker 1>australopithecus for 50 and homoerectus </v>

931
00:42:12.001 --> 00:42:13.350
<v Speaker 1>nine slash 60.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

932
00:42:13.470 --> 00:42:14.820
<v Speaker 1>So you got doubling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A brain says,</v>

933
00:42:14.821 --> 00:42:15.151
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind you.</v>

934
00:42:15.151 --> 00:42:15.984
<v Speaker 1>It's a bigger being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not as quite as big dramatic of </v>

935
00:42:18.351 --> 00:42:19.184
<v Speaker 1>a change as you think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But along with that comes all sorts of </v>

936
00:42:21.001 --> 00:42:21.834
<v Speaker 1>capabilities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you write about this book catching </v>

937
00:42:23.791 --> 00:42:24.090
<v Speaker 1>fire.</v>

938
00:42:24.090 --> 00:42:26.760
<v Speaker 1>Richard wrangham argued that what </v>
<v Speaker 1>enabled that?</v>

939
00:42:26.761 --> 00:42:30.180
<v Speaker 1>So if you look at the gut of a gorilla </v>
<v Speaker 1>or a chimpanzee in their brain,</v>

940
00:42:30.181 --> 00:42:31.014
<v Speaker 1>they got a lot of guts for a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>of brain because it takes a lot of </v>

941
00:42:33.181 --> 00:42:35.640
<v Speaker 1>digestion to keep a little bit of brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>going.</v>

942
00:42:35.850 --> 00:42:38.720
<v Speaker 1>We have a tiny gut for a huge brain and </v>
<v Speaker 1>rang a argues,</v>

943
00:42:38.730 --> 00:42:39.563
<v Speaker 1>and I think quite rightly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the only way you can achieve that </v>

944
00:42:41.581 --> 00:42:43.680
<v Speaker 1>is by releasing more nutrients from your</v>
<v Speaker 1>food.</v>

945
00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:44.693
<v Speaker 1>And the only way you can release more </v>
<v Speaker 1>nutrients from your food is by cooking </v>

946
00:42:46.531 --> 00:42:48.330
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when he made that argument,</v>

947
00:42:48.331 --> 00:42:50.580
<v Speaker 1>he thinks it goes back to the beginning </v>
<v Speaker 1>of homo erectus.</v>

948
00:42:50.581 --> 00:42:54.150
<v Speaker 1>And I suspect he's right at this point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he made the argument,</v>

949
00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:55.380
<v Speaker 1>we.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was only back to,</v>

950
00:42:55.381 --> 00:42:58.410
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember half a million years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>350,000.</v>

951
00:42:58.411 --> 00:42:59.940
<v Speaker 1>It's already back to a million years </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>

952
00:42:59.941 --> 00:43:03.690
<v Speaker 1>We found in caves in South Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence of control of fire.</v>

953
00:43:04.010 --> 00:43:06.860
<v Speaker 1>and so it'll probably keep getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>pushed back because you know that crap.</v>

954
00:43:06.870 --> 00:43:09.960
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to find.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this was a half million years,</v>

955
00:43:09.961 --> 00:43:11.600
<v Speaker 1>so now it's back to a million </v>
<v Speaker 1>millionaires.</v>

956
00:43:11.790 --> 00:43:13.890
<v Speaker 1>And he made that prediction when it </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't even that far back</v>

957
00:43:13.970 --> 00:43:14.803
<v Speaker 3>in a million years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though they're not technically not </v>

958
00:43:17.721 --> 00:43:18.430
<v Speaker 3>homeless.</v>

959
00:43:18.430 --> 00:43:19.850
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're still at home erectus.</v>

960
00:43:20.130 --> 00:43:22.430
<v Speaker 1>And so they started a one point nine or </v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

961
00:43:22.431 --> 00:43:25.790
<v Speaker 1>one point 7 million years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one point nine,</v>

962
00:43:25.791 --> 00:43:28.460
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what homo erectus could now do.</v>

963
00:43:28.461 --> 00:43:31.750
<v Speaker 1>So now remember what the argument is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this social leap,</v>

964
00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:36.500
<v Speaker 1>it's this collective action that not </v>
<v Speaker 1>only protects us on the savanna but sets</v>

965
00:43:36.501 --> 00:43:39.200
<v Speaker 1>us on this new pathway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It creates this new niche.</v>

966
00:43:39.201 --> 00:43:40.034
<v Speaker 1>It's this cognitive niche,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I think of it as a social </v>

967
00:43:41.601 --> 00:43:42.434
<v Speaker 1>cognitive niche because it's the working</v>
<v Speaker 1>together that gives you all these </v>

968
00:43:44.991 --> 00:43:48.860
<v Speaker 1>potential advantages to getting smarter </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so now when that gene sitting in our</v>

969
00:43:48.861 --> 00:43:49.694
<v Speaker 1>head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it kicks into gear those and starts </v>

970
00:43:51.231 --> 00:43:54.200
<v Speaker 1>to work and it leads to cranial </v>
<v Speaker 1>expansion,</v>

971
00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:55.303
<v Speaker 1>those animals will have and will have an</v>
<v Speaker 1>advantage because they can coordinate </v>

972
00:43:57.201 --> 00:43:59.570
<v Speaker 1>with each other better and so they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember,</v>

973
00:43:59.571 --> 00:44:00.404
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you helped me out last time but you </v>

974
00:44:01.671 --> 00:44:01.970
<v Speaker 1>weren't.</v>

975
00:44:01.970 --> 00:44:03.260
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't count on you.</v>

976
00:44:03.261 --> 00:44:05.120
<v Speaker 1>So I'm avoiding you and I'm sticking </v>
<v Speaker 1>with you.</v>

977
00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:06.333
<v Speaker 1>They can do a lot of things with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>brainpower and by the time you get to </v>

978
00:44:08.541 --> 00:44:10.100
<v Speaker 1>homo erectus and the brain power is </v>
<v Speaker 1>doubled.</v>

979
00:44:10.101 --> 00:44:12.080
<v Speaker 1>We see all sorts of super interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

980
00:44:12.410 --> 00:44:15.530
<v Speaker 1>So before homo erectus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you look at our tools,</v>

981
00:44:15.570 --> 00:44:16.403
<v Speaker 1>it's called an older one tool and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically a barely sharpened rock and </v>

982
00:44:19.581 --> 00:44:20.414
<v Speaker 1>you never find an older one tool to very</v>
<v Speaker 1>far away from wherever it was quarried </v>

983
00:44:24.111 --> 00:44:25.310
<v Speaker 1>and made like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

984
00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:26.263
<v Speaker 1>you look at the rock and the chips and </v>
<v Speaker 1>not far away is where it's lying on the </v>

985
00:44:28.731 --> 00:44:31.380
<v Speaker 1>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Homo erectus made a much nicer tool.</v>

986
00:44:31.381 --> 00:44:32.310
<v Speaker 1>It's bi-facial.</v>

987
00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:33.293
<v Speaker 2>It took a lot of energy to make it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When we teach modern anthropologists or </v>

988
00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:38.933
<v Speaker 2>grad students or whatever to make them </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you put them in an mri magnet where </v>

989
00:44:41.461 --> 00:44:43.950
<v Speaker 2>it can measure your metabolism and your </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain is you go,</v>

990
00:44:44.250 --> 00:44:45.083
<v Speaker 2>you see that it takes a lot of frontal </v>
<v Speaker 2>lobe functioning in order to make one </v>

991
00:44:48.330 --> 00:44:49.163
<v Speaker 2>because it's a lot of planning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>how am I going to hit it next to make </v>

992
00:44:51.001 --> 00:44:51.834
<v Speaker 2>this thing just right compared to an </v>
<v Speaker 2>older one tool to make those doesn't </v>

993
00:44:54.421 --> 00:44:57.210
<v Speaker 2>take much frontal functioning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just racket there and it'll be sharp.</v>

994
00:44:57.600 --> 00:45:01.440
<v Speaker 2>And so the first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know homo erectus invented that tool,</v>

995
00:45:01.570 --> 00:45:02.403
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this assurion tool with his bi-facial </v>

996
00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:05.920
<v Speaker 2>handhelds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and second of all,</v>

997
00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.100
<v Speaker 2>and one of my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the coolest findings,</v>

998
00:45:08.101 --> 00:45:11.880
<v Speaker 2>there's some interesting work in a one </v>
<v Speaker 2>point 2 million year old site in India,</v>

999
00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:13.033
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by carrie sHipped and where he finds </v>

1000
00:45:13.921 --> 00:45:18.921
<v Speaker 2>that the production of these tools is </v>
<v Speaker 2>separated spatially about the place.</v>

1001
00:45:20.310 --> 00:45:24.510
<v Speaker 2>So the first step is bashing loose a big</v>
<v Speaker 2>piece of rock and that's done here.</v>

1002
00:45:24.540 --> 00:45:25.373
<v Speaker 2>And then 10 meters over there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody doing the initial chipping on </v>

1003
00:45:27.721 --> 00:45:28.554
<v Speaker 2>it and 10 meters over there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody sharpening up the final </v>

1004
00:45:30.961 --> 00:45:31.950
<v Speaker 2>touches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1005
00:45:31.951 --> 00:45:35.010
<v Speaker 2>if you were making it by yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would you systematically walk around</v>

1006
00:45:35.011 --> 00:45:37.200
<v Speaker 2>the site as you made it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You almost assuredly wouldn't.</v>

1007
00:45:37.650 --> 00:45:40.260
<v Speaker 2>But if you've got division of labor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're the big strong guy,</v>

1008
00:45:40.261 --> 00:45:41.094
<v Speaker 2>you do the first thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you hand it to me and I do the </v>

1009
00:45:42.631 --> 00:45:43.464
<v Speaker 2>finer sharpening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes sense that it would be </v>

1010
00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:50.040
<v Speaker 2>spatially distributed about the site.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's that evidence for division of</v>

1011
00:45:50.041 --> 00:45:50.874
<v Speaker 2>labor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's the evidence that they're </v>

1012
00:45:51.241 --> 00:45:52.074
<v Speaker 2>bringing down some pretty fast animals </v>
<v Speaker 2>like horses and potentially even </v>

1013
00:45:54.601 --> 00:45:55.434
<v Speaker 2>bringing down elephants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which in those days are like twice the </v>

1014
00:45:56.881 --> 00:45:57.714
<v Speaker 2>size of an elephant and then they using </v>
<v Speaker 2>spirits at that point we don't know </v>

1015
00:46:01.201 --> 00:46:02.160
<v Speaker 2>because they didn't survive.</v>

1016
00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:03.870
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And nothing would is still around.</v>

1017
00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:04.733
<v Speaker 2>There's no sign of hafting anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if it was beers it would have been a </v>

1018
00:46:06.781 --> 00:46:07.614
<v Speaker 2>wooden point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I think what they could meaning the </v>

1019
00:46:09.811 --> 00:46:12.440
<v Speaker 2>end of it like cut in half.</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you could stick an ear tip.</v>

1020
00:46:12.770 --> 00:46:13.603
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then exactly strapping it on or any </v>

1021
00:46:15.961 --> 00:46:17.100
<v Speaker 2>of a variety of were put.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1022
00:46:17.550 --> 00:46:19.920
<v Speaker 2>And so they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was no sign of that yet,</v>

1023
00:46:20.010 --> 00:46:21.910
<v Speaker 2>but there's no reason why they couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a sharpened spirit.</v>

1024
00:46:21.911 --> 00:46:22.770
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know that.</v>

1025
00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:23.873
<v Speaker 2>Remember the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mentioned the chimps in Senegal that </v>

1026
00:46:25.741 --> 00:46:26.574
<v Speaker 2>live on the savannah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're the only chimps on earth who do </v>

1027
00:46:28.111 --> 00:46:30.390
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll bite the stick to sharpen it and</v>

1028
00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:33.990
<v Speaker 2>poke them monkeys to when they're in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>hollow of a tree and stab up.</v>

1029
00:46:34.010 --> 00:46:35.780
<v Speaker 2>Did you see that recent discovery and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in.</v>

1030
00:46:35.790 --> 00:46:36.623
<v Speaker 2>It's really recently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was an article I read one or two </v>

1031
00:46:38.131 --> 00:46:41.010
<v Speaker 2>days ago at about orangutans when they </v>
<v Speaker 2>gave them wire.</v>

1032
00:46:41.340 --> 00:46:43.920
<v Speaker 2>They use the wire to fashion and into </v>
<v Speaker 2>fishhooks.</v>

1033
00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:46.050
<v Speaker 2>Now I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's totally cool.</v>

1034
00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:50.550
<v Speaker 2>They figured out how to make a fishhook </v>
<v Speaker 2>independently and that's amazing.</v>

1035
00:46:50.580 --> 00:46:52.710
<v Speaker 2>You've seen them like spearfish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1036
00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:54.130
<v Speaker 2>Hangover,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tornadoes that.</v>

1037
00:46:54.131 --> 00:46:56.880
<v Speaker 2>That's that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That picture is actually of an orangutan</v>

1038
00:46:56.940 --> 00:46:59.370
<v Speaker 2>who's watched fishermen do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He couldn't do It.</v>

1039
00:46:59.730 --> 00:47:00.563
<v Speaker 2>Remember an orangutan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it meant you could literally pull </v>

1040
00:47:01.921 --> 00:47:04.650
<v Speaker 2>your arms off like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The enormous strength,</v>

1041
00:47:04.660 --> 00:47:05.493
<v Speaker 2>particular gearing for that strength.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got very poor motor control like </v>

1042
00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:09.900
<v Speaker 2>you and I can type.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can't do that.</v>

1043
00:47:09.940 --> 00:47:11.410
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that,</v>

1044
00:47:11.430 --> 00:47:12.263
<v Speaker 2>that orangutan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that famous photo never could catch </v>

1045
00:47:14.311 --> 00:47:17.220
<v Speaker 2>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seen it done and it was trying to see if</v>

1046
00:47:17.221 --> 00:47:18.330
<v Speaker 2>he could do it too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fair enough.</v>

1047
00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:21.600
<v Speaker 2>He's trying to use a timer but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

1048
00:47:21.601 --> 00:47:22.434
<v Speaker 2>there's these corporate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these crows and such dell fashioned </v>

1049
00:47:25.141 --> 00:47:26.210
<v Speaker 2>hooks to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1050
00:47:26.310 --> 00:47:27.143
<v Speaker 2>So there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of amazing evidence for </v>

1051
00:47:28.411 --> 00:47:30.820
<v Speaker 2>this sort of animal ingenuity and making</v>
<v Speaker 2>tools will.</v>

1052
00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:34.610
<v Speaker 2>You've seen the studies with crows were </v>
<v Speaker 2>they use one stick to get a larger study</v>

1053
00:47:34.750 --> 00:47:37.360
<v Speaker 2>to get a larger food?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>

1054
00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:40.840
<v Speaker 2>Now the one thing is we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can do that and then they fail some</v>

1055
00:47:40.841 --> 00:47:41.674
<v Speaker 2>super simple tests so it could be that </v>
<v Speaker 2>their brains tiny though they are </v>

1056
00:47:44.471 --> 00:47:45.304
<v Speaker 2>dedicated to a particular way of solving</v>
<v Speaker 2>a particular problem because it's </v>

1057
00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:48.833
<v Speaker 2>especially these ones that live in new </v>
<v Speaker 2>caledonia do this in the wild and so </v>

1058
00:47:51.851 --> 00:47:53.470
<v Speaker 2>they they fashioned amount of palm </v>
<v Speaker 2>fronds,</v>

1059
00:47:53.471 --> 00:47:54.304
<v Speaker 2>they tear it off and they reshape it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they hook insects out of the bark </v>

1060
00:47:57.071 --> 00:47:57.904
<v Speaker 2>of trees and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you could imagine that they've </v>

1061
00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:02.020
<v Speaker 2>kind oF learned a specific way of </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem solving,</v>

1062
00:48:02.021 --> 00:48:02.854
<v Speaker 2>but they can't do something that to you </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you would solve that using some </v>

1063
00:48:05.411 --> 00:48:07.960
<v Speaker 2>pretty domain general mechanisms to you </v>
<v Speaker 2>looks the same.</v>

1064
00:48:07.961 --> 00:48:09.040
<v Speaker 2>But to them it's totally different.</v>

1065
00:48:09.130 --> 00:48:13.390
<v Speaker 3>Did you find a thing with the ringtones?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really crazy.</v>

1066
00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:15.820
<v Speaker 3>It's just a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1067
00:48:15.821 --> 00:48:17.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd read something.</v>

1068
00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:18.873
<v Speaker 3>Here we go rank 10 spontaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ben straight wires into hooks to fish </v>

1069
00:48:22.620 --> 00:48:24.580
<v Speaker 3>for food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is amazing.</v>

1070
00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:26.920
<v Speaker 3>Is they have a photo of a jamie if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>scroll down a little bit there,</v>

1071
00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:28.270
<v Speaker 3>but does that photo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just.</v>

1072
00:48:28.470 --> 00:48:31.570
<v Speaker 3>I'll just him with a stick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1073
00:48:31.580 --> 00:48:32.650
<v Speaker 3>that's really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really cool.</v>

1074
00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:34.233
<v Speaker 3>I had read something a few years back </v>
<v Speaker 3>that said that they were agreeing that </v>

1075
00:48:38.410 --> 00:48:41.560
<v Speaker 3>chimpanzees had officially moved into </v>
<v Speaker 3>the stone age.</v>

1076
00:48:42.430 --> 00:48:43.263
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so chimpanzees were used stones as </v>

1077
00:48:44.681 --> 00:48:47.080
<v Speaker 2>tools,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they'll crack nuts with them,</v>

1078
00:48:47.430 --> 00:48:50.890
<v Speaker 2>but they've never.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've never been shown to modify stone</v>

1079
00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:53.230
<v Speaker 2>tiles and so if you want to say the </v>
<v Speaker 2>stone age,</v>

1080
00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:54.340
<v Speaker 2>doosan stones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by all means,</v>

1081
00:48:54.341 --> 00:48:56.010
<v Speaker 2>if you want to say it's modifying </v>
<v Speaker 2>stones.</v>

1082
00:48:56.200 --> 00:48:57.033
<v Speaker 2>The the oldest evidence that we have </v>
<v Speaker 2>potentially modified is three point 3 </v>

1083
00:49:00.490 --> 00:49:02.170
<v Speaker 2>million years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These lamech we tools,</v>

1084
00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:04.460
<v Speaker 2>but there's argument about how legit </v>
<v Speaker 2>those right.</v>

1085
00:49:04.710 --> 00:49:05.543
<v Speaker 3>There's argument about a lot of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>sites too where they believe that they </v>

1086
00:49:07.591 --> 00:49:08.424
<v Speaker 3>find stone tools that are ancient </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it could easily just spend </v>

1087
00:49:10.900 --> 00:49:11.733
<v Speaker 3>shale.</v>

1088
00:49:11.870 --> 00:49:12.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And overwatch.</v>

1089
00:49:12.951 --> 00:49:15.620
<v Speaker 2>It's super complicated to know exactly </v>
<v Speaker 2>when it got laid down,</v>

1090
00:49:15.621 --> 00:49:17.720
<v Speaker 2>everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'll get lucky and the and the layers</v>

1091
00:49:17.721 --> 00:49:20.000
<v Speaker 2>are super orderly and then when you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>to that layer,</v>

1092
00:49:20.001 --> 00:49:20.834
<v Speaker 2>you know exactly what you got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now what's the chances of finding </v>

1093
00:49:22.791 --> 00:49:27.440
<v Speaker 2>what you're after there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right now when they say the stone age,</v>

1094
00:49:27.470 --> 00:49:28.303
<v Speaker 2>that's what they mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just the idea of consciously using a </v>

1095
00:49:30.171 --> 00:49:32.570
<v Speaker 2>rock to like smash open a clam or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

1096
00:49:32.571 --> 00:49:32.931
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1097
00:49:32.931 --> 00:49:33.820
<v Speaker 2>to me that does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1098
00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:37.100
<v Speaker 2>I gotta I gotta admit I'm not quite sure</v>
<v Speaker 2>technically what an anthropologist would</v>

1099
00:49:37.101 --> 00:49:39.300
<v Speaker 2>mean when they say stone age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

1100
00:49:39.550 --> 00:49:40.383
<v Speaker 2>to what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we know is that chimps will do </v>

1101
00:49:42.081 --> 00:49:43.340
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll use rocks to,</v>

1102
00:49:43.490 --> 00:49:44.323
<v Speaker 2>they'll even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they're clever enough to have an </v>

1103
00:49:45.201 --> 00:49:48.650
<v Speaker 2>anvil basically like her hammer ball </v>
<v Speaker 2>based on put a rock on it,</v>

1104
00:49:48.651 --> 00:49:49.820
<v Speaker 2>smash what?</v>

1105
00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:50.653
<v Speaker 2>They're not clever enough to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So chimps have partial theory of mind </v>

1106
00:49:54.100 --> 00:49:54.933
<v Speaker 2>and theory of mind is this idea that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>know that the contents of your mind </v>

1107
00:49:57.531 --> 00:49:58.364
<v Speaker 2>differ from the contents of mine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And all humans get there when they're </v>

1108
00:50:00.950 --> 00:50:03.920
<v Speaker 2>little around age four.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the.</v>

1109
00:50:04.020 --> 00:50:04.853
<v Speaker 2>And you can see the penny drop because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they just assume everybody knows the </v>

1110
00:50:06.771 --> 00:50:09.330
<v Speaker 2>same things and everybody's the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>preferences and,</v>

1111
00:50:09.490 --> 00:50:10.760
<v Speaker 2>and that's why when they're really </v>
<v Speaker 2>little,</v>

1112
00:50:10.761 --> 00:50:11.594
<v Speaker 2>their stories can be hard to follow </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they assume what's in your head </v>

1113
00:50:13.821 --> 00:50:16.460
<v Speaker 2>is the same as theirs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They assume you liked the same things.</v>

1114
00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:17.473
<v Speaker 2>And actually it turns out that the ones </v>
<v Speaker 2>who have siblings learn it earlier </v>

1115
00:50:20.061 --> 00:50:21.900
<v Speaker 2>because like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh you like the red jellybeans.</v>

1116
00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:23.180
<v Speaker 2>I like the green ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>

1117
00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:25.220
<v Speaker 2>This is a beneficial deal for both of </v>
<v Speaker 2>us,</v>

1118
00:50:25.221 --> 00:50:26.054
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1119
00:50:26.690 --> 00:50:27.523
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can get partial theory of mind so I </v>

1120
00:50:28.851 --> 00:50:30.300
<v Speaker 2>could see what you could say.</v>

1121
00:50:30.410 --> 00:50:31.243
<v Speaker 2>I know what you could see at your angle </v>
<v Speaker 2>of how much chimp and I know that might </v>

1122
00:50:33.861 --> 00:50:34.694
<v Speaker 2>differ from what I could see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they can't get to the point of </v>

1123
00:50:36.981 --> 00:50:39.860
<v Speaker 2>knowing that you could represent beliefs</v>
<v Speaker 2>that aren't true,</v>

1124
00:50:40.130 --> 00:50:41.630
<v Speaker 2>that you could have deeply,</v>
<v Speaker 2>etc.</v>

1125
00:50:41.690 --> 00:50:44.300
<v Speaker 2>Or that maybe I don't like bananas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he does like,</v>

1126
00:50:44.330 --> 00:50:45.163
<v Speaker 2>but then they can't really get there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what the problem is without </v>

1127
00:50:47.751 --> 00:50:49.610
<v Speaker 2>theory of mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you teach somebody?</v>

1128
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:51.770
<v Speaker 2>Because if I just assume you know what I</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1129
00:50:51.980 --> 00:50:53.940
<v Speaker 2>then when you're doing a crappy job </v>
<v Speaker 2>breaking the net,</v>

1130
00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:55.430
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's wrong with joe here?</v>

1131
00:50:55.950 --> 00:51:00.410
<v Speaker 2>And so chip mothers take years to to </v>
<v Speaker 2>teach their offspring,</v>

1132
00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:03.350
<v Speaker 2>to break these nuts open 10 years on </v>
<v Speaker 2>average,</v>

1133
00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:04.393
<v Speaker 2>because first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't get a chance to do it very </v>

1134
00:51:05.241 --> 00:51:06.590
<v Speaker 2>often.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then that's got to be in season.</v>

1135
00:51:06.940 --> 00:51:08.810
<v Speaker 2>Second of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's easy to bReak your fingers and that</v>

1136
00:51:08.811 --> 00:51:09.650
<v Speaker 2>kind of slows you down.</v>

1137
00:51:09.980 --> 00:51:10.813
<v Speaker 2>But third of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll occasionally make some very </v>

1138
00:51:13.011 --> 00:51:16.130
<v Speaker 2>specific corrections when the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the offspring is doing it wrong,</v>

1139
00:51:16.370 --> 00:51:17.203
<v Speaker 2>but they don't know what the problem is </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they don't know what the kid </v>

1140
00:51:19.191 --> 00:51:20.024
<v Speaker 2>doesn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when you don't know that you </v>

1141
00:51:21.711 --> 00:51:22.544
<v Speaker 2>can't teach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why humans are stunningly </v>

1142
00:51:24.291 --> 00:51:27.080
<v Speaker 2>effective teachers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fascinating.</v>

1143
00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:31.130
<v Speaker 2>So chimps learn more just by observing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1144
00:51:31.131 --> 00:51:31.964
<v Speaker 2>and what's amazing about the way chimps </v>
<v Speaker 2>observed is that because we have theory </v>

1145
00:51:34.881 --> 00:51:36.980
<v Speaker 2>of mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we also do imitate differently.</v>

1146
00:51:37.140 --> 00:51:37.973
<v Speaker 2>So there's this amazing experiment by </v>
<v Speaker 2>andy white and his colleagues and what </v>

1147
00:51:40.131 --> 00:51:42.380
<v Speaker 2>they did is they created this treasure </v>
<v Speaker 2>box.</v>

1148
00:51:42.620 --> 00:51:45.710
<v Speaker 2>And so inside this treasure box,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is something that a chimp or a kid</v>

1149
00:51:45.711 --> 00:51:46.544
<v Speaker 2>wants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a little piece of food and in one </v>

1150
00:51:48.771 --> 00:51:49.604
<v Speaker 2>condition the box is totally opaque so </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't see how it works and they'll </v>

1151
00:51:52.521 --> 00:51:53.354
<v Speaker 2>poke at the top of it and then the poke </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the middle and it pops open and then </v>

1152
00:51:56.361 --> 00:51:57.950
<v Speaker 2>they give it to the chimp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>close it up.</v>

1153
00:51:58.070 --> 00:51:59.390
<v Speaker 2>Chimp does the exact same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Poke,</v>

1154
00:51:59.391 --> 00:51:59.811
<v Speaker 2>poke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>poke,</v>

1155
00:51:59.811 --> 00:52:00.650
<v Speaker 2>poke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pops open,</v>

1156
00:52:00.830 --> 00:52:02.450
<v Speaker 2>give it to a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does the exact same thing.</v>

1157
00:52:02.930 --> 00:52:03.763
<v Speaker 2>Now they do the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do the replicate that same </v>

1158
00:52:05.451 --> 00:52:06.284
<v Speaker 2>experiment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but instead of having that box be </v>

1159
00:52:07.551 --> 00:52:08.384
<v Speaker 2>opaque,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's translucent and you can see well </v>

1160
00:52:10.251 --> 00:52:11.990
<v Speaker 2>and truly the poking the top does </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>

1161
00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:13.033
<v Speaker 2>The latch is actually right here and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>that initial poke was a waste of your </v>

1162
00:52:15.681 --> 00:52:16.514
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This second one actually is one that </v>

1163
00:52:18.411 --> 00:52:21.440
<v Speaker 2>opened the box up when when chimps watch</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1164
00:52:21.470 --> 00:52:23.960
<v Speaker 2>they skip the first one and they just </v>
<v Speaker 2>opened the box.</v>

1165
00:52:24.290 --> 00:52:28.910
<v Speaker 2>Kids despite being smarter than a chimp </v>
<v Speaker 2>poke at the top first and then they poke</v>

1166
00:52:28.911 --> 00:52:31.760
<v Speaker 2>it in the bottom and we call this over </v>
<v Speaker 2>imitation.</v>

1167
00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:34.640
<v Speaker 2>They're imitating clearly irrelevant </v>
<v Speaker 2>actions.</v>

1168
00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:35.953
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would anybody imitate clearly </v>

1169
00:52:37.111 --> 00:52:39.110
<v Speaker 2>irrelevant actions?</v>
<v Speaker 2>WhAt advantage would it give you?</v>

1170
00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:40.730
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have theory of mind,</v>

1171
00:52:40.970 --> 00:52:42.770
<v Speaker 2>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's joe's box.</v>

1172
00:52:42.770 --> 00:52:46.340
<v Speaker 2>He knows something about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There may be a reason why I can't see,</v>

1173
00:52:46.550 --> 00:52:48.710
<v Speaker 2>but then maybe reason why he's poking at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the top first,</v>

1174
00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:50.570
<v Speaker 2>and so I better do everything that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>does.</v>

1175
00:52:50.571 --> 00:52:51.404
<v Speaker 2>I better have the highest fidelity </v>
<v Speaker 2>copying that I possibly can because it </v>

1176
00:52:54.471 --> 00:52:55.304
<v Speaker 2>may be valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what you end up with is these </v>

1177
00:52:57.521 --> 00:52:58.354
<v Speaker 2>systems around the world where people </v>
<v Speaker 2>eat these amazing foods that you think </v>

1178
00:53:01.300 --> 00:53:02.133
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how on earth could they ever figured </v>

1179
00:53:02.811 --> 00:53:03.890
<v Speaker 2>that out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1180
00:53:03.891 --> 00:53:04.724
<v Speaker 2>it was probably developed step by step </v>
<v Speaker 2>and everybody's always got this super </v>

1181
00:53:07.281 --> 00:53:09.650
<v Speaker 2>high fidelity imitation because they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>over imitating.</v>

1182
00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:12.000
<v Speaker 2>So my favorite examples in new Guinea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1183
00:53:12.010 --> 00:53:12.843
<v Speaker 2>the sago palm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure if you've ever seen a sago </v>

1184
00:53:14.601 --> 00:53:15.434
<v Speaker 2>palm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it does not look like an edible </v>

1185
00:53:16.161 --> 00:53:17.870
<v Speaker 2>tree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just looks like a free country.</v>

1186
00:53:17.871 --> 00:53:19.830
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it turns out that if you,</v>

1187
00:53:20.010 --> 00:53:23.000
<v Speaker 2>you chop the tree down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take the bark off,</v>

1188
00:53:23.220 --> 00:53:26.040
<v Speaker 2>take like an ads or something similar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grind up the sawdust,</v>

1189
00:53:26.250 --> 00:53:27.210
<v Speaker 2>have all that sawdust.</v>

1190
00:53:27.260 --> 00:53:28.093
<v Speaker 2>you then wash it off in warm water </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of course all the water in new </v>

1191
00:53:30.211 --> 00:53:32.190
<v Speaker 2>Guinea will be nice and warm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that causes.</v>

1192
00:53:32.191 --> 00:53:33.024
<v Speaker 2>It's a super high starch tree that </v>
<v Speaker 2>causes the starch molecules to separate </v>

1193
00:53:35.941 --> 00:53:37.710
<v Speaker 2>from the sawdust because at that point </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's inevitable.</v>

1194
00:53:38.130 --> 00:53:41.670
<v Speaker 2>So then they have these cloth and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>starch molecules pass through the cloth,</v>

1195
00:53:41.671 --> 00:53:44.220
<v Speaker 2>the sawdust one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now they collect this cloudy water.</v>

1196
00:53:44.221 --> 00:53:47.560
<v Speaker 2>They put in these traditional canoes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they let it sit overnight and all of the</v>

1197
00:53:47.561 --> 00:53:50.850
<v Speaker 2>starts sinks to the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they pour the water off the top and</v>

1198
00:53:50.851 --> 00:53:51.684
<v Speaker 2>now they've got this flower.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you have to dry it out in the sun </v>

1199
00:53:52.981 --> 00:53:54.540
<v Speaker 2>really faster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It becomes toxic.</v>

1200
00:53:54.780 --> 00:53:58.050
<v Speaker 2>So it's like this nine step process that</v>
<v Speaker 2>who on earth could ever come up with it,</v>

1201
00:53:58.051 --> 00:53:59.970
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But once it's in place,</v>

1202
00:53:59.971 --> 00:54:02.130
<v Speaker 2>once they slowly figured it out to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>it work,</v>

1203
00:54:02.460 --> 00:54:04.830
<v Speaker 2>everybody just does it the same way </v>
<v Speaker 2>because even though they don't know,</v>

1204
00:54:05.010 --> 00:54:06.570
<v Speaker 2>they may understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they don't need to.</v>

1205
00:54:06.750 --> 00:54:07.910
<v Speaker 2>They just know this is how we do.</v>

1206
00:54:09.030 --> 00:54:09.980
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's like that.</v>

1207
00:54:10.260 --> 00:54:13.300
<v Speaker 3>What is that root that they cassava?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1208
00:54:13.370 --> 00:54:14.203
<v Speaker 3>That if you don't cook it correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's literally cyanide and they have </v>

1209
00:54:18.961 --> 00:54:22.260
<v Speaker 3>water from and they have to take that </v>
<v Speaker 3>water and they have the buckets of these</v>

1210
00:54:22.261 --> 00:54:23.094
<v Speaker 3>water,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the water for that they're using to </v>

1211
00:54:26.430 --> 00:54:27.263
<v Speaker 3>create this stuff and they just leave it</v>
<v Speaker 3>laying around and kids are playing </v>

1212
00:54:30.361 --> 00:54:33.360
<v Speaker 3>around it and the pigs and animals </v>
<v Speaker 3>around it.</v>

1213
00:54:33.361 --> 00:54:35.250
<v Speaker 3>And if they drank it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'd be dead.</v>

1214
00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:36.113
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1215
00:54:36.330 --> 00:54:37.740
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The detoxing of cassava.</v>

1216
00:54:37.741 --> 00:54:39.450
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunate I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not familiar with that.</v>

1217
00:54:39.451 --> 00:54:42.540
<v Speaker 2>But there's a lot of those examples and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're also right that in those kinds of</v>

1218
00:54:42.541 --> 00:54:43.374
<v Speaker 2>societies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're super relaxed about things that </v>

1219
00:54:45.361 --> 00:54:46.430
<v Speaker 2>we strike the strike.</v>

1220
00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:48.310
<v Speaker 3>Kill you quote.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1221
00:54:48.340 --> 00:54:49.110
<v Speaker 3>But that's tough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1222
00:54:49.110 --> 00:54:50.800
<v Speaker 3>It becomes cyanide,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1223
00:54:51.100 --> 00:54:52.390
<v Speaker 3>You could be right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know that one.</v>

1224
00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:56.740
<v Speaker 3>See if you could find this because it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>on an episode of that same show.</v>

1225
00:54:56.741 --> 00:54:57.574
<v Speaker 3>It's this show is called meat eater.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's my friend steve who went and spent </v>

1226
00:55:00.791 --> 00:55:04.210
<v Speaker 3>some time with them down in the jungle </v>
<v Speaker 3>south America.</v>

1227
00:55:04.211 --> 00:55:05.044
<v Speaker 3>It's really interesting stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just seeing how these people function </v>

1228
00:55:08.441 --> 00:55:09.274
<v Speaker 3>and and they have this big vat and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're cooking this stuff and he was </v>

1229
00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:15.640
<v Speaker 3>explaining like right now if you hate </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1230
00:55:15.670 --> 00:55:18.000
<v Speaker 3>you're dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to wait a while and like,</v>

1231
00:55:18.010 --> 00:55:22.200
<v Speaker 3>how the fuck did they figure this out?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Researchers to get to the sinai.</v>

1232
00:55:22.201 --> 00:55:23.034
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cyanide producing abilities because I </v>

1233
00:55:25.820 --> 00:55:28.270
<v Speaker 3>was the third most important food source</v>
<v Speaker 3>in tropical countries,</v>

1234
00:55:28.271 --> 00:55:29.104
<v Speaker 3>but as one major problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the roots and the leaves of poorly </v>

1235
00:55:30.821 --> 00:55:31.654
<v Speaker 3>processed cassava plants contain a </v>
<v Speaker 3>substance that when eaten can trigger </v>

1236
00:55:34.151 --> 00:55:37.030
<v Speaker 3>the production of cyanide,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kills the shit out of you.</v>

1237
00:55:38.050 --> 00:55:41.800
<v Speaker 3>But it's weird that that thing is like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>major staple in their diet.</v>

1238
00:55:41.980 --> 00:55:44.020
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a really good example of a,</v>

1239
00:55:44.021 --> 00:55:47.410
<v Speaker 2>the value of human learning and this </v>
<v Speaker 2>over invitation process,</v>

1240
00:55:47.411 --> 00:55:48.430
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the first guy where they go,</v>

1241
00:55:48.431 --> 00:55:49.390
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to do that.</v>

1242
00:55:49.410 --> 00:55:50.243
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then this person aided unaided </v>

1243
00:55:51.430 --> 00:55:53.290
<v Speaker 2>successful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's take a look at what they did.</v>

1244
00:55:53.670 --> 00:55:54.503
<v Speaker 2>So I remember when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was turned to learn to play baseball </v>

1245
00:55:56.981 --> 00:56:00.640
<v Speaker 2>and pitch the ball and the person raises</v>
<v Speaker 2>their knee almost up to their nipples.</v>

1246
00:56:00.820 --> 00:56:01.653
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the most awkward pitching motion </v>

1247
00:56:03.371 --> 00:56:05.230
<v Speaker 2>I've ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I didn't occur to me.</v>

1248
00:56:05.260 --> 00:56:06.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1249
00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:07.570
<v Speaker 2>It occurred me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1250
00:56:07.570 --> 00:56:09.080
<v Speaker 2>there must be a reason to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1251
00:56:09.081 --> 00:56:09.914
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what can I do to try to emulate that </v>

1252
00:56:11.651 --> 00:56:12.484
<v Speaker 2>motion?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1253
00:56:12.600 --> 00:56:13.433
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole,</v>

1254
00:56:14.860 --> 00:56:16.900
<v Speaker 2>the whole nine yards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a purpose for every one of those</v>

1255
00:56:16.901 --> 00:56:18.700
<v Speaker 2>pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as humans we're saying,</v>

1256
00:56:18.701 --> 00:56:19.534
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're teaching me how you've got to </v>

1257
00:56:20.861 --> 00:56:21.694
<v Speaker 2>have a reason for doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the huge between us and </v>

1258
00:56:23.921 --> 00:56:24.430
<v Speaker 2>everybody</v>

1259
00:56:24.430 --> 00:56:25.263
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody else can do that theory of mind </v>

1260
00:56:26.441 --> 00:56:29.560
<v Speaker 1>thing to make that assumption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why the chimps skip that step</v>

1261
00:56:29.561 --> 00:56:30.394
<v Speaker 1>that they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they know at least in that </v>

1262
00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:34.780
<v Speaker 1>particular tournament is really actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>useless and kids don't.</v>

1263
00:56:34.870 --> 00:56:35.410
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1264
00:56:35.410 --> 00:56:36.243
<v Speaker 3>you're a concept is that as these </v>
<v Speaker 3>animals that used to be monkeys start </v>

1265
00:56:41.510 --> 00:56:42.343
<v Speaker 3>evolving and trying out new things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one thing that they learn as they enter </v>

1266
00:56:46.131 --> 00:56:49.090
<v Speaker 3>into this new climate as if there's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>massive benefit to.</v>

1267
00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:51.910
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I would say it's not monkeys because</v>

1268
00:56:52.090 --> 00:56:55.170
<v Speaker 1>technically speaking aren't all apes </v>
<v Speaker 1>monkeys,</v>

1269
00:56:55.171 --> 00:56:57.170
<v Speaker 1>but not all monkeys or apes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1270
00:56:57.190 --> 00:57:01.390
<v Speaker 1>So a monkeys and apes are different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They split off a month.</v>

1271
00:57:01.820 --> 00:57:02.653
<v Speaker 3>He's not a real word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's not a word in terms of </v>

1272
00:57:04.311 --> 00:57:05.540
<v Speaker 3>scientific designation,</v>

1273
00:57:05.590 --> 00:57:07.410
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even the monkey of two different things.</v>

1274
00:57:07.560 --> 00:57:08.380
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's.</v>

1275
00:57:08.380 --> 00:57:10.140
<v Speaker 1>There's old world monkeys in new world </v>
<v Speaker 1>monkeys,</v>

1276
00:57:10.500 --> 00:57:13.670
<v Speaker 1>but all of them have a genus and species</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1277
00:57:14.010 --> 00:57:15.600
<v Speaker 1>But it's not a scientific name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1278
00:57:16.010 --> 00:57:18.240
<v Speaker 1>There's a key's not now they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>primates.</v>

1279
00:57:18.241 --> 00:57:20.130
<v Speaker 1>They're all privates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did I read?</v>

1280
00:57:20.131 --> 00:57:21.960
<v Speaker 1>The cv?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Google that google.</v>

1281
00:57:21.961 --> 00:57:22.800
<v Speaker 1>There was a whole</v>

1282
00:57:23.010 --> 00:57:24.540
<v Speaker 3>bullet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anthropologist wrote that.</v>

1283
00:57:24.810 --> 00:57:27.660
<v Speaker 3>Not all apes or monkeys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but all monkey.</v>

1284
00:57:27.720 --> 00:57:30.240
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not all monkeys or apes,</v>

1285
00:57:30.241 --> 00:57:33.600
<v Speaker 3>but all apes or monkeys because monkeys </v>
<v Speaker 3>almost a slang term</v>

1286
00:57:34.250 --> 00:57:35.930
<v Speaker 1>because it's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's bullshit,</v>

1287
00:57:35.931 --> 00:57:36.764
<v Speaker 1>but we'll find out that what I would say</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it all apes and monkeys are primates </v>

1288
00:57:40.220 --> 00:57:42.560
<v Speaker 1>and they all started from monkey </v>
<v Speaker 1>ancestry.</v>

1289
00:57:42.561 --> 00:57:43.394
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1290
00:57:43.490 --> 00:57:45.290
<v Speaker 1>And so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then the ape split off.</v>

1291
00:57:45.291 --> 00:57:47.720
<v Speaker 1>You've got to rang content.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The great apes are orangutans,</v>

1292
00:57:47.840 --> 00:57:49.190
<v Speaker 1>gorillas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chimps and us,</v>

1293
00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:51.410
<v Speaker 1>and then you got gibbons which are </v>
<v Speaker 1>lesser apes,</v>

1294
00:57:51.411 --> 00:57:54.110
<v Speaker 1>which split off quite a while ago and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're very different.</v>

1295
00:57:54.111 --> 00:57:55.820
<v Speaker 1>They don't have the brain power of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>great apes.</v>

1296
00:57:55.930 --> 00:57:59.240
<v Speaker 3>Do you find anything like that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I read this a few years ago.</v>

1297
00:57:59.241 --> 00:58:02.920
<v Speaker 3>Was it confused the shit out of me </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I didn't know that monkey wasn't</v>

1298
00:58:02.921 --> 00:58:03.910
<v Speaker 3>a scientific term.</v>

1299
00:58:03.910 --> 00:58:04.743
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientists talk about old world monkeys </v>

1300
00:58:05.411 --> 00:58:09.840
<v Speaker 1>in new world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's almost a slang term as well.</v>

1301
00:58:09.850 --> 00:58:10.960
<v Speaker 1>Whenever you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're.</v>

1302
00:58:11.050 --> 00:58:11.883
<v Speaker 1>If you're a prepper biologist and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have the species and say that was a </v>

1303
00:58:14.950 --> 00:58:18.910
<v Speaker 1>chimpanzee is thing I found.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it like pen light source,</v>

1304
00:58:18.911 --> 00:58:19.744
<v Speaker 1>but it pops up</v>

1305
00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:21.590
<v Speaker 3>on google.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1306
00:58:21.650 --> 00:58:22.850
<v Speaker 3>Comes up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a longer.</v>

1307
00:58:22.851 --> 00:58:23.684
<v Speaker 3>It's there's more to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Apes or monkeys in the same way that </v>

1308
00:58:27.081 --> 00:58:30.380
<v Speaker 3>monkeys are primates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Humans are apes and I am a human.</v>

1309
00:58:30.410 --> 00:58:32.000
<v Speaker 3>It's called the nested hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

1310
00:58:32.830 --> 00:58:36.140
<v Speaker 3>It means that all apes or monkeys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not all monkeys or apes,</v>

1311
00:58:36.141 --> 00:58:37.850
<v Speaker 3>just as all humans are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Abe's,</v>

1312
00:58:38.030 --> 00:58:40.080
<v Speaker 3>but not all apes are humans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1313
00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:42.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Zygoma per click on that link.</v>

1314
00:58:42.920 --> 00:58:45.710
<v Speaker 3>They get someone's website at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1315
00:58:45.711 --> 00:58:47.300
<v Speaker 3>This is what I read.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1316
00:58:47.301 --> 00:58:49.160
<v Speaker 3>is this a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is this a bullshit article?</v>

1317
00:58:49.161 --> 00:58:50.360
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>

1318
00:58:50.450 --> 00:58:52.640
<v Speaker 3>Apes or monkeys deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's another term.</v>

1319
00:58:52.641 --> 00:58:56.420
<v Speaker 3>I don't know the origin of the term.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mark martin robbins wrote a fun piece to</v>

1320
00:58:56.421 --> 00:58:58.720
<v Speaker 3>the lay scientists the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the incorrect term.</v>

1321
00:58:58.740 --> 00:58:59.573
<v Speaker 3>These monkeys described apes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It triggered an article by graham smith </v>

1322
00:59:02.541 --> 00:59:04.250
<v Speaker 3>for the daily mail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In martin's words,</v>

1323
00:59:04.251 --> 00:59:05.084
<v Speaker 3>a great crime against entry is in </v>
<v Speaker 3>progress and it's time for someone to </v>

1324
00:59:10.101 --> 00:59:12.040
<v Speaker 3>draw a line.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So as a parent,</v>

1325
00:59:12.170 --> 00:59:13.150
<v Speaker 3>how do yoU say that pen</v>

1326
00:59:13.240 --> 00:59:14.050
<v Speaker 1>today?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Antic.</v>

1327
00:59:14.050 --> 00:59:15.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I never stood by itself,</v>

1328
00:59:16.490 --> 00:59:17.323
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with a professional interest in the </v>

1329
00:59:18.231 --> 00:59:20.480
<v Speaker 3>issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm taking my stand to help ensure the,</v>

1330
00:59:20.690 --> 00:59:22.640
<v Speaker 3>that a miscarriage of pedantic</v>

1331
00:59:22.730 --> 00:59:25.250
<v Speaker 1>justice doesn't occur.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy likes that word.</v>

1332
00:59:26.050 --> 00:59:27.620
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nested hierarchies.</v>

1333
00:59:27.650 --> 00:59:29.930
<v Speaker 1>Apes or monkeys in the same way that </v>
<v Speaker 1>monkeys are primates.</v>

1334
00:59:30.110 --> 00:59:31.580
<v Speaker 1>Humans are abe's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm a human,</v>

1335
00:59:31.610 --> 00:59:34.920
<v Speaker 1>it's called a nested hierarchy and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>has a primate nested hierarchy setup.</v>

1336
00:59:35.340 --> 00:59:36.830
<v Speaker 1>Could be right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't know.</v>

1337
00:59:36.831 --> 00:59:37.664
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the origin of the term,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he cares and he cares enough to put </v>

1338
00:59:40.581 --> 00:59:41.301
<v Speaker 1>that up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1339
00:59:41.301 --> 00:59:43.020
<v Speaker 1>he fucked my head up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just dude.</v>

1340
00:59:43.700 --> 00:59:46.310
<v Speaker 1>You could be right or not right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

1341
00:59:46.340 --> 00:59:48.300
<v Speaker 1>if anybody's right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's right or you're right.</v>

1342
00:59:48.970 --> 00:59:50.210
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no knowledge.</v>

1343
00:59:50.370 --> 00:59:51.203
<v Speaker 1>But all I mean is that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the ancestors who moved to the </v>

1344
00:59:53.151 --> 00:59:56.060
<v Speaker 1>savannah weren't monkeys like baboon </v>
<v Speaker 1>monkeys,</v>

1345
00:59:57.270 --> 00:59:59.660
<v Speaker 1>chimp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ancient chimp.</v>

1346
00:59:59.810 --> 01:00:02.660
<v Speaker 1>And so once we get tome erectus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're Basically like us,</v>

1347
01:00:02.661 --> 01:00:06.140
<v Speaker 1>although there are brains there around </v>
<v Speaker 1>nine 60 were around 13,</v>

1348
01:00:06.141 --> 01:00:09.260
<v Speaker 1>15 and we literally have a chimp brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>added on top of there.</v>

1349
01:00:09.770 --> 01:00:11.690
<v Speaker 1>So There's a big difference and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely right.</v>

1350
01:00:11.691 --> 01:00:15.740
<v Speaker 1>It's accelerating like crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I am totally convinced.</v>

1351
01:00:15.770 --> 01:00:17.120
<v Speaker 1>Well I believe rang gms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1352
01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:19.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean we don't know for sure of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I believe he's right,</v>

1353
01:00:19.101 --> 01:00:21.470
<v Speaker 1>that it was fired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They played a huge role in that.</v>

1354
01:00:21.710 --> 01:00:22.543
<v Speaker 1>And so what you got is this process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where are our evolution facilitates a </v>

1355
01:00:25.101 --> 01:00:26.090
<v Speaker 1>further evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1356
01:00:26.091 --> 01:00:26.924
<v Speaker 1>So you get the cognitive capacities to </v>
<v Speaker 1>control fire and now that allows you to </v>

1357
01:00:30.021 --> 01:00:32.450
<v Speaker 1>grow your brain even larger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because we can,</v>

1358
01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:33.313
<v Speaker 1>we can store fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can get more nutrients from the food </v>

1359
01:00:34.851 --> 01:00:37.280
<v Speaker 1>we eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can detoxify other things.</v>

1360
01:00:37.450 --> 01:00:38.283
<v Speaker 1>Fire super valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even chimps will eat if they go through </v>

1361
01:00:40.821 --> 01:00:42.320
<v Speaker 1>a area where there's a forest fire and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1362
01:00:42.321 --> 01:00:46.400
<v Speaker 1>speaking to what's going on locally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll eat like the roasted nuts first.</v>

1363
01:00:46.401 --> 01:00:48.180
<v Speaker 1>They really liked that because I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1364
01:00:48.220 --> 01:00:50.660
<v Speaker 1>just you go in your kitchen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you smell a raw steak.</v>

1365
01:00:50.660 --> 01:00:53.270
<v Speaker 1>It's like palatable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You smell it when it's cooking.</v>

1366
01:00:53.271 --> 01:00:55.440
<v Speaker 1>It's delicious or that is interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1367
01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:56.353
<v Speaker 1>That's us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No salt or anything on our nose telling </v>

1368
01:00:58.341 --> 01:01:01.550
<v Speaker 1>us that is a great source of food and </v>
<v Speaker 1>nutrients.</v>

1369
01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:03.470
<v Speaker 1>That's not so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is interesting.</v>

1370
01:01:03.471 --> 01:01:05.510
<v Speaker 1>I've never thought about it that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

1371
01:01:05.511 --> 01:01:06.344
<v Speaker 1>there's a tremendous difference in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way your body reacts to it and it's not </v>

1372
01:01:09.471 --> 01:01:13.710
<v Speaker 1>just based on your experience eating it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just smells amazing.</v>

1373
01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:15.800
<v Speaker 1>It smells amazing and so random talks </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

1374
01:01:15.801 --> 01:01:16.634
<v Speaker 1>he argues that you can't live on a diet </v>
<v Speaker 1>of raw food unless you're reading these </v>

1375
01:01:20.690 --> 01:01:21.523
<v Speaker 1>super fruits and stuff like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that basically we've horticulture into </v>

1376
01:01:23.811 --> 01:01:27.140
<v Speaker 1>existence because raw food just doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>give you enough calories.</v>

1377
01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:30.260
<v Speaker 1>So the example that he uses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a great one,</v>

1378
01:01:30.410 --> 01:01:34.730
<v Speaker 1>is chimps literally spent something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>six to eight hours a day chewing just to</v>

1379
01:01:34.731 --> 01:01:37.670
<v Speaker 1>soften up the food enough so that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>can swallow it and digest it.</v>

1380
01:01:38.180 --> 01:01:39.980
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if sushi you're hardly,</v>

1381
01:01:39.981 --> 01:01:40.814
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the things that we cooked and </v>

1382
01:01:41.661 --> 01:01:43.130
<v Speaker 1>that's all in that case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1383
01:01:43.131 --> 01:01:44.450
<v Speaker 1>cooked steak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really nice one.</v>

1384
01:01:44.451 --> 01:01:46.750
<v Speaker 1>You barely chew it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just down the hatch.</v>

1385
01:01:46.751 --> 01:01:47.584
<v Speaker 1>It goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a great argument for gorillas </v>

1386
01:01:49.011 --> 01:01:49.671
<v Speaker 1>as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1387
01:01:49.671 --> 01:01:50.504
<v Speaker 1>Because gorillas are just eating roots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking celery and so literally they </v>

1388
01:01:53.211 --> 01:01:56.720
<v Speaker 1>have a humongous got right constantly </v>
<v Speaker 1>chewing in order to me and they've got a</v>

1389
01:01:56.721 --> 01:01:57.554
<v Speaker 1>huge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sagittal crest right here with the </v>

1390
01:01:58.311 --> 01:01:59.144
<v Speaker 1>bone so that the muscles attached to it </v>
<v Speaker 1>so they can chew hard enough to get </v>

1391
01:02:02.181 --> 01:02:04.160
<v Speaker 1>through all that stuff and make a </v>
<v Speaker 1>digestible and still there.</v>

1392
01:02:04.161 --> 01:02:05.450
<v Speaker 1>God is enormous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1393
01:02:05.451 --> 01:02:06.284
<v Speaker 1>that is interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The chimps have those enormous chewing </v>

1394
01:02:07.881 --> 01:02:08.714
<v Speaker 1>muscles on their head and so we lost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another example where somebody </v>

1395
01:02:11.481 --> 01:02:14.270
<v Speaker 1>along the way last,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember what that gene was,</v>

1396
01:02:14.271 --> 01:02:16.880
<v Speaker 1>where our muscles weakened in our jaw </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that would have been a year.</v>

1397
01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.710
<v Speaker 1>That would have been a death knell if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're back cooking,</v>

1398
01:02:19.770 --> 01:02:20.000
<v Speaker 1>right</v>

1399
01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:20.833
<v Speaker 2>post cooking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All that does is free up space for get </v>

1400
01:02:22.591 --> 01:02:25.770
<v Speaker 2>rid of some unnecessary muscle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>free up morris cranio space for brains,</v>

1401
01:02:25.771 --> 01:02:27.180
<v Speaker 2>the inside,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not the outside,</v>

1402
01:02:27.330 --> 01:02:28.163
<v Speaker 2>so is it likely that there was a bunch </v>
<v Speaker 2>of different factors that there was </v>

1403
01:02:30.901 --> 01:02:31.734
<v Speaker 2>natural selection in play and that there</v>
<v Speaker 2>was also the the throwing arm and then </v>

1404
01:02:35.731 --> 01:02:36.564
<v Speaker 2>also cooking and also this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this cooperative effort that led to </v>

1405
01:02:41.671 --> 01:02:43.830
<v Speaker 2>people being a little bit more </v>
<v Speaker 2>ingenious,</v>

1406
01:02:43.940 --> 01:02:44.773
<v Speaker 2>a little bit smarter and how they hunted</v>
<v Speaker 2>and how they tried to get food and then </v>

1407
01:02:48.691 --> 01:02:51.780
<v Speaker 2>how they protected their fire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how they cultivated fire,</v>

1408
01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:52.833
<v Speaker 2>and that all these things lead to more </v>
<v Speaker 2>clever behavior which led to a natural </v>

1409
01:02:56.641 --> 01:02:57.474
<v Speaker 2>selection of clever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more clever champs with larger brains </v>

1410
01:03:00.511 --> 01:03:03.140
<v Speaker 2>are apes rather with larger brains?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely,</v>

1411
01:03:03.150 --> 01:03:05.580
<v Speaker 2>and so anytime you got something major </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening,</v>

1412
01:03:05.581 --> 01:03:06.414
<v Speaker 2>it probably doesn't have a single cause,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it probably has lots and lots of causes </v>

1413
01:03:09.630 --> 01:03:12.420
<v Speaker 2>and so in this case all these kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>factors came together.</v>

1414
01:03:12.450 --> 01:03:15.480
<v Speaker 2>Now if you're standing at the outset and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're playing god and saying,</v>

1415
01:03:15.481 --> 01:03:16.314
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's see what happens when I dry out </v>

1416
01:03:16.861 --> 01:03:17.694
<v Speaker 2>the rain forest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think nine times out of 10 the chimps </v>

1417
01:03:19.591 --> 01:03:20.910
<v Speaker 2>all end up dead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1418
01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:21.833
<v Speaker 2>But somehow we got really lucky and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>went down this very particular road and </v>

1419
01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:28.950
<v Speaker 2>once they got their social act together </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they started cooperating,</v>

1420
01:03:29.220 --> 01:03:30.053
<v Speaker 2>chimps are never going to be very </v>
<v Speaker 2>effective in groups because they can't </v>

1421
01:03:31.621 --> 01:03:33.330
<v Speaker 2>get along.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can cooperate very well,</v>

1422
01:03:33.710 --> 01:03:34.543
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but once these animals probably had us </v>

1423
01:03:36.691 --> 01:03:37.230
<v Speaker 2>fill a pivot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gus,</v>

1424
01:03:37.230 --> 01:03:38.063
<v Speaker 2>but maybe not till later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course we don't know all we can look </v>

1425
01:03:39.841 --> 01:03:40.674
<v Speaker 2>at what they were capable of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it fits the storyline that they </v>

1426
01:03:43.111 --> 01:03:44.340
<v Speaker 2>would have been the ones who develop </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1427
01:03:44.341 --> 01:03:47.250
<v Speaker 2>Once that happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>social becomes everything.</v>

1428
01:03:47.251 --> 01:03:48.084
<v Speaker 2>So we tend to think about what are the </v>
<v Speaker 2>challenges of physical life like sago </v>

1429
01:03:52.651 --> 01:03:53.190
<v Speaker 2>palm.</v>

1430
01:03:53.190 --> 01:03:55.560
<v Speaker 2>You move into that territory and you got</v>
<v Speaker 2>to configure that out.</v>

1431
01:03:55.561 --> 01:03:56.394
<v Speaker 2>It seems enormously complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have to remember that before </v>

1432
01:03:58.651 --> 01:03:59.484
<v Speaker 2>modern travel was invented,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody walked everywhere which meant </v>

1433
01:04:01.890 --> 01:04:02.723
<v Speaker 2>you spent your entire life basically in </v>
<v Speaker 2>territory that you're familiar with or </v>

1434
01:04:05.581 --> 01:04:06.414
<v Speaker 2>the kinds of animals that lived there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the kinds of problems that you face and </v>

1435
01:04:08.671 --> 01:04:09.504
<v Speaker 2>so cognitively the terrain is not really</v>
<v Speaker 2>a challenge for you and how to even </v>

1436
01:04:12.751 --> 01:04:15.810
<v Speaker 2>making food in those really complicated </v>
<v Speaker 2>ways is not a challenge for you.</v>

1437
01:04:15.811 --> 01:04:17.880
<v Speaker 2>Once you got theory of mind and you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>learn how to do it,</v>

1438
01:04:18.330 --> 01:04:22.140
<v Speaker 2>but what is a huge challenge for you is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the social interactions with each other.</v>

1439
01:04:22.260 --> 01:04:25.350
<v Speaker 2>Because as my group gets smarter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm not smarter for sole member,</v>

1440
01:04:25.351 --> 01:04:27.870
<v Speaker 2>we talked about sexual selection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to get picked.</v>

1441
01:04:27.871 --> 01:04:29.880
<v Speaker 2>I'll get left behind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Second of all,</v>

1442
01:04:30.030 --> 01:04:32.040
<v Speaker 2>we live in a world where there's no law </v>
<v Speaker 2>enforcement,</v>

1443
01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:35.150
<v Speaker 2>and so the day that you decide that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>more troubled than I'm worth,</v>

1444
01:04:35.151 --> 01:04:35.820
<v Speaker 2>I'd go to sleep on.</v>

1445
01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:36.653
<v Speaker 2>I never wake up again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so I have to be able to manage some </v>

1446
01:04:38.671 --> 01:04:41.460
<v Speaker 2>very complicated relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a little bit in my mind,</v>

1447
01:04:41.461 --> 01:04:42.990
<v Speaker 2>it's like every morning when you wake </v>
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>

1448
01:04:42.991 --> 01:04:43.824
<v Speaker 2>it's to an episode of the sopranos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How are you going to find a way to get </v>

1449
01:04:46.411 --> 01:04:47.700
<v Speaker 2>through your day without getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>whacked?</v>

1450
01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:49.500
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you can't figure it out,</v>

1451
01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:53.700
<v Speaker 2>that's the end of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever read any terence mckenna?</v>

1452
01:04:53.830 --> 01:04:56.730
<v Speaker 2>I know you're familiar with something </v>
<v Speaker 2>called the stoned ape theory.</v>

1453
01:04:57.480 --> 01:04:58.291
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>

1454
01:04:58.291 --> 01:04:59.520
<v Speaker 2>not mckenna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

1455
01:04:59.521 --> 01:05:00.450
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>

1456
01:05:00.451 --> 01:05:01.284
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an ethnobotanist and he was also a </v>

1457
01:05:02.820 --> 01:05:05.310
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic adventure and he had a </v>
<v Speaker 2>theory.</v>

1458
01:05:05.700 --> 01:05:09.450
<v Speaker 2>And the theory was that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're talking about,</v>

1459
01:05:09.451 --> 01:05:14.370
<v Speaker 2>this climate change that also coincided </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a doubling of the human brain size.</v>

1460
01:05:15.010 --> 01:05:18.130
<v Speaker 2>His theory was that one of the things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was</v>

1461
01:05:18.130 --> 01:05:18.963
<v Speaker 3>in play was that these apes would </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiment with different food sources </v>

1462
01:05:22.121 --> 01:05:22.954
<v Speaker 3>as they moved into the grasslands and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a lot of undulates and these </v>

1463
01:05:25.991 --> 01:05:26.824
<v Speaker 3>grasslands and it siliciden mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which we know existed back then would </v>

1464
01:05:29.801 --> 01:05:34.730
<v Speaker 3>grow in these grasslands and that these </v>
<v Speaker 3>monkeys,</v>

1465
01:05:34.750 --> 01:05:35.583
<v Speaker 3>apes rather started consuming siliciden </v>
<v Speaker 3>mushrooms and it led them to be more </v>

1466
01:05:38.831 --> 01:05:39.664
<v Speaker 3>creative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it also led to specific traits like </v>

1467
01:05:41.770 --> 01:05:42.603
<v Speaker 3>the development of language that eating </v>
<v Speaker 3>mushrooms in low doses increases visual </v>

1468
01:05:48.011 --> 01:05:50.110
<v Speaker 3>acuity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which would lead them to be better.</v>

1469
01:05:50.111 --> 01:05:53.920
<v Speaker 3>Hunters are more perceptive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It also leads them to be hornier,</v>

1470
01:05:54.370 --> 01:05:58.750
<v Speaker 3>which would most likely involve more </v>
<v Speaker 3>breeding,</v>

1471
01:05:58.930 --> 01:05:59.763
<v Speaker 3>more sexual activity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and possibly select the ones that chose </v>

1472
01:06:04.340 --> 01:06:05.173
<v Speaker 3>the mushrooms would maybe possibly breed</v>
<v Speaker 3>more than the ones that didn't choose </v>

1473
01:06:09.401 --> 01:06:11.350
<v Speaker 3>the mushrooms because they were more </v>
<v Speaker 3>into it.</v>

1474
01:06:11.351 --> 01:06:15.280
<v Speaker 3>And then we're more social,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more sexually active.</v>

1475
01:06:15.730 --> 01:06:18.480
<v Speaker 3>And he has a series of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1476
01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:21.940
<v Speaker 3>like his brother dennis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's still alive,</v>

1477
01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:23.133
<v Speaker 3>detailed it on a podcast we did the very</v>
<v Speaker 3>first podcast we did in his brother is </v>

1478
01:06:26.911 --> 01:06:28.720
<v Speaker 3>an,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as is an actual scientist.</v>

1479
01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:29.913
<v Speaker 3>And detailed it in terms of how silicide</v>
<v Speaker 3>affects the brain and what areas of the </v>

1480
01:06:35.321 --> 01:06:37.360
<v Speaker 3>brain it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

1481
01:06:37.420 --> 01:06:38.253
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what actually takes place when you're </v>

1482
01:06:40.301 --> 01:06:41.134
<v Speaker 3>under the influence of this and that it </v>
<v Speaker 3>could very potentially have led to the </v>

1483
01:06:44.441 --> 01:06:48.760
<v Speaker 3>development of language and that this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these things in play,</v>

1484
01:06:48.761 --> 01:06:49.594
<v Speaker 3>the throwing arm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the developing these new social </v>

1485
01:06:53.351 --> 01:06:54.600
<v Speaker 3>networks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1486
01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:55.633
<v Speaker 3>where you need to communicate with each </v>
<v Speaker 3>other along with the harnessing of fire </v>

1487
01:07:00.130 --> 01:07:04.660
<v Speaker 3>along with the consumption of </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic mushrooms on a regular basis</v>

1488
01:07:04.661 --> 01:07:06.940
<v Speaker 3>because they were incredibly frequent </v>
<v Speaker 3>and very admirable.</v>

1489
01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:08.110
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's total trip.</v>

1490
01:07:08.140 --> 01:07:09.690
<v Speaker 1>I've never heard of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fascinating.</v>

1491
01:07:09.890 --> 01:07:10.723
<v Speaker 1>It would be really like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a really good example of some </v>

1492
01:07:12.121 --> 01:07:14.340
<v Speaker 1>random thing if it really did play that </v>
<v Speaker 1>role,</v>

1493
01:07:14.520 --> 01:07:15.353
<v Speaker 1>how random that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that these freaking things happen to be </v>

1494
01:07:16.771 --> 01:07:19.590
<v Speaker 1>growing there and that they happen to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>attracted to them and ate them.</v>

1495
01:07:19.770 --> 01:07:23.760
<v Speaker 1>We know that animals like to get high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm elephants will eat these fruits that</v>

1496
01:07:23.761 --> 01:07:26.850
<v Speaker 1>have well the drunk in this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>overripe and,</v>

1497
01:07:26.860 --> 01:07:29.850
<v Speaker 1>and have become alcoholic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know that animals will do that.</v>

1498
01:07:29.900 --> 01:07:30.733
<v Speaker 3>you've seen jaguars that consumed </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic plants and they rely on </v>

1499
01:07:33.171 --> 01:07:35.840
<v Speaker 3>their back and stare at the sky and no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1500
01:07:35.841 --> 01:07:38.300
<v Speaker 3>it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know what iowasca is?</v>

1501
01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:41.180
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Iowasca is a,</v>

1502
01:07:42.470 --> 01:07:44.420
<v Speaker 3>it's a way that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1503
01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:45.673
<v Speaker 3>these people in the rain forest develop </v>
<v Speaker 3>untold thousands of years ago of </v>

1504
01:07:50.750 --> 01:07:54.290
<v Speaker 3>developing an orally active version of </v>
<v Speaker 3>dimethyltryptamine.</v>

1505
01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:58.070
<v Speaker 3>Do you know what their mental tryptamine</v>
<v Speaker 3>dimethyltryptamine is?</v>

1506
01:07:58.071 --> 01:08:00.040
<v Speaker 3>The most potent psychedelic known to </v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1507
01:08:00.041 --> 01:08:04.700
<v Speaker 3>It's incredibly potent drug that is just</v>
<v Speaker 3>intensely hallucinatory.</v>

1508
01:08:04.940 --> 01:08:08.410
<v Speaker 3>Gives you these insane visions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it also is this.</v>

1509
01:08:08.780 --> 01:08:11.000
<v Speaker 3>Here's a jaguar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really crazy.</v>

1510
01:08:11.210 --> 01:08:12.043
<v Speaker 3>And this is in the amazon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These jaguars eat these plants and </v>

1511
01:08:15.260 --> 01:08:20.260
<v Speaker 3>plants are the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have the ingredients of iowasca and</v>

1512
01:08:20.811 --> 01:08:21.644
<v Speaker 3>these jaguars are known to eat these </v>
<v Speaker 3>things and then trip her fucking balls </v>

1513
01:08:24.411 --> 01:08:25.244
<v Speaker 3>off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>they eat them and there are pupils </v>

1514
01:08:26.241 --> 01:08:29.060
<v Speaker 3>dilate and they roll over on their back </v>
<v Speaker 3>and stare at the sky.</v>

1515
01:08:29.060 --> 01:08:30.480
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're clearly high.</v>

1516
01:08:31.220 --> 01:08:33.210
<v Speaker 3>So this is something that you're going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to say,</v>

1517
01:08:33.211 --> 01:08:34.160
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what I'm gonna say.</v>

1518
01:08:34.340 --> 01:08:35.173
<v Speaker 3>So this is what iowasca is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is dimethyltryptamine look kind of cool </v>

1519
01:08:39.621 --> 01:08:43.650
<v Speaker 3>watching this jaguar trip balls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just stare.</v>

1520
01:08:43.910 --> 01:08:45.600
<v Speaker 3>They see shit that's not there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1521
01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:48.020
<v Speaker 3>or it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're still traveling.</v>

1522
01:08:48.050 --> 01:08:52.100
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what iowasca is is w,</v>

1523
01:08:52.370 --> 01:08:53.203
<v Speaker 3>there's dimethyltryptamine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is this incredibly potent </v>

1524
01:08:55.611 --> 01:08:57.740
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic drug is produced in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>human body.</v>

1525
01:08:57.741 --> 01:09:00.650
<v Speaker 3>It's produced by the liver.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's produced by the lungs,</v>

1526
01:09:00.651 --> 01:09:03.200
<v Speaker 3>and they also believe it's produced by </v>
<v Speaker 3>the pineal gland,</v>

1527
01:09:03.230 --> 01:09:04.063
<v Speaker 3>which is literally your third eye,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pineal gland in certain reptiles </v>

1528
01:09:07.551 --> 01:09:09.830
<v Speaker 3>actually as a rep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a retina in a lens.</v>

1529
01:09:10.130 --> 01:09:10.963
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's like an eyeball and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>think that the egyptians called it the </v>

1530
01:09:14.211 --> 01:09:18.470
<v Speaker 3>seed of the soul and they think that </v>
<v Speaker 3>this is one of the reasons why they have</v>

1531
01:09:18.471 --> 01:09:23.300
<v Speaker 3>this obsession with this gland in </v>
<v Speaker 3>eastern mysticism is somehow or another,</v>

1532
01:09:23.301 --> 01:09:24.134
<v Speaker 3>they figured out that this is the gland </v>
<v Speaker 3>that produces this incredibly potent </v>

1533
01:09:27.801 --> 01:09:28.640
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic truck.</v>

1534
01:09:29.030 --> 01:09:29.863
<v Speaker 3>This psychedelic drug dimethyltryptAmine</v>
<v Speaker 3>also exists in thousands of different </v>

1535
01:09:33.171 --> 01:09:34.004
<v Speaker 3>plants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem is when you consume it </v>

1536
01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:38.480
<v Speaker 3>orally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your body produces something in your gut</v>

1537
01:09:38.481 --> 01:09:41.990
<v Speaker 3>called monoamine oxidase,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and monoamine oxidase breaks it down.</v>

1538
01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:43.033
<v Speaker 3>So what these indigenous people figured </v>
<v Speaker 3>out is how to combine one plant which </v>

1539
01:09:47.691 --> 01:09:48.524
<v Speaker 3>contains this psychedelic compound with </v>
<v Speaker 3>another plant which contains a natural </v>

1540
01:09:52.221 --> 01:09:55.820
<v Speaker 3>mao inhibitor called harming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they brew this all together,</v>

1541
01:09:55.821 --> 01:09:56.654
<v Speaker 3>much like they did the cassava,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which we have no idea how they figured </v>

1542
01:09:58.851 --> 01:09:59.684
<v Speaker 3>that out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They bring this stuff up together and </v>

1543
01:10:00.741 --> 01:10:04.310
<v Speaker 3>they create this psychedelic t called </v>
<v Speaker 3>iowasca and iowasca.</v>

1544
01:10:04.311 --> 01:10:05.144
<v Speaker 3>Now they have all these trips where </v>
<v Speaker 3>people go down to Peru and take this </v>

1545
01:10:08.211 --> 01:10:11.840
<v Speaker 3>stuff and trip to fucking balls off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this,</v>

1546
01:10:11.841 --> 01:10:12.860
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1547
01:10:12.930 --> 01:10:17.930
<v Speaker 3>the combination of these things leads to</v>
<v Speaker 3>this incredibly potent trench,</v>

1548
01:10:20.060 --> 01:10:24.950
<v Speaker 3>really transformative experience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is impossible to describe and that</v>

1549
01:10:24.951 --> 01:10:26.840
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this psychedelic drug.</v>

1550
01:10:26.870 --> 01:10:27.920
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why did I bring that up?</v>

1551
01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:32.590
<v Speaker 1>Was what we were talking about how maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>chimps and are these early ancestors did</v>

1552
01:10:32.591 --> 01:10:33.424
<v Speaker 1>something similar which pushed them </v>
<v Speaker 1>along this path that starting to </v>

1553
01:10:35.801 --> 01:10:36.660
<v Speaker 1>communicate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did I get it?</v>

1554
01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:39.450
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How did I get the iowaSca?</v>

1555
01:10:40.110 --> 01:10:40.943
<v Speaker 3>There are a couple of links in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>chain is because of animals that get </v>

1556
01:10:43.141 --> 01:10:43.750
<v Speaker 3>high.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

1557
01:10:43.750 --> 01:10:46.350
<v Speaker 3>that's what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is what this.</v>

1558
01:10:46.670 --> 01:10:48.000
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

1559
01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:50.010
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The jaguar getting high on dmt,</v>

1560
01:10:50.310 --> 01:10:51.420
<v Speaker 3>that's what they think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The jaguar,</v>

1561
01:10:51.421 --> 01:10:55.530
<v Speaker 3>it's the jaguar consuming this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's making them trip on dmt.</v>

1562
01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:57.990
<v Speaker 3>Dmt is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's fun.</v>

1563
01:10:58.170 --> 01:11:00.180
<v Speaker 3>it's really exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's.</v>

1564
01:11:00.300 --> 01:11:01.133
<v Speaker 1>So robert trevors is wonderful biologist</v>
<v Speaker 1>who started a lot of the kinds of work </v>

1565
01:11:04.561 --> 01:11:06.300
<v Speaker 1>that we're talking about going in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>seventies,</v>

1566
01:11:06.660 --> 01:11:09.120
<v Speaker 1>calls these sorts of things of </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenotypic intelligence,</v>

1567
01:11:09.121 --> 01:11:09.954
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So evolution gave you these pleasure </v>

1568
01:11:11.491 --> 01:11:12.324
<v Speaker 1>centers in your brain so that you do in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your genes best interests and kill the </v>

1569
01:11:16.171 --> 01:11:18.630
<v Speaker 1>animal or get the girl or whatever and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes you feel good.</v>

1570
01:11:18.870 --> 01:11:21.480
<v Speaker 1>And so we tend to like the things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are good for us in dislike,</v>

1571
01:11:21.490 --> 01:11:23.400
<v Speaker 1>the things that are bad for us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't want to eat feces,</v>

1572
01:11:23.401 --> 01:11:24.234
<v Speaker 1>we do on a to stick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's cases like this where it </v>

1573
01:11:27.601 --> 01:11:29.610
<v Speaker 1>short circuits that it goes right to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pleasure center.</v>

1574
01:11:29.611 --> 01:11:31.590
<v Speaker 1>Even though what it's doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of irrelevant,</v>

1575
01:11:32.010 --> 01:11:34.340
<v Speaker 1>but this is a case where maybe it wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>irrelevant.</v>

1576
01:11:34.350 --> 01:11:35.183
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it actually causes animals to then</v>
<v Speaker 1>change the way that they behave to </v>

1577
01:11:37.501 --> 01:11:38.520
<v Speaker 1>become more sociable.</v>

1578
01:11:38.730 --> 01:11:39.690
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very possible.</v>

1579
01:11:39.691 --> 01:11:42.180
<v Speaker 1>Something like that played a role along </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way,</v>

1580
01:11:42.450 --> 01:11:46.440
<v Speaker 1>which is why if you replay the sequence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the vanishing rainforest 10 times,</v>

1581
01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:47.393
<v Speaker 1>only one time does it maybe lead to </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything good and the other nine times </v>

1582
01:11:49.961 --> 01:11:52.890
<v Speaker 1>that leads to a bunch of dead chimps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1583
01:11:52.950 --> 01:11:55.650
<v Speaker 1>Well the the process is probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly slow,</v>

1584
01:11:55.651 --> 01:11:56.484
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Over millions of years of the climate </v>

1585
01:11:57.631 --> 01:11:58.464
<v Speaker 1>did alter was right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you've got millions of years for the </v>

1586
01:12:00.001 --> 01:12:02.460
<v Speaker 1>rain forest to disappear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you get these animals to slowly,</v>

1587
01:12:02.461 --> 01:12:03.690
<v Speaker 1>slowly say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got no choice.</v>

1588
01:12:03.691 --> 01:12:07.410
<v Speaker 1>So they figure it out and then I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>for three and a half million years,</v>

1589
01:12:07.411 --> 01:12:10.710
<v Speaker 1>literally there's skulking around the </v>
<v Speaker 1>edges and they figured nothing out,</v>

1590
01:12:10.980 --> 01:12:13.490
<v Speaker 1>but there was a pressure on them to walk</v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

1591
01:12:13.491 --> 01:12:14.324
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And nobody knows for sure what that </v>

1592
01:12:15.391 --> 01:12:18.090
<v Speaker 1>pressure is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hypothesis that has some possible.</v>

1593
01:12:18.091 --> 01:12:19.530
<v Speaker 1>There's probably a lot of reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1594
01:12:19.530 --> 01:12:21.870
<v Speaker 1>Any time something big happens is </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably a lot of causes.</v>

1595
01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:23.033
<v Speaker 1>So some people said that you can cover </v>
<v Speaker 1>ground more efficiently when you walk </v>

1596
01:12:25.171 --> 01:12:25.501
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1597
01:12:25.501 --> 01:12:26.334
<v Speaker 1>With fewer calories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and especially this idea of slowly </v>

1598
01:12:28.681 --> 01:12:29.514
<v Speaker 1>running down animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You may have heard about this notion of </v>

1599
01:12:31.170 --> 01:12:34.160
<v Speaker 1>persistence hunting exactly and talked </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that yesterday.</v>

1600
01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:35.720
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1601
01:12:35.970 --> 01:12:39.480
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but another reason is so ask yourself,</v>

1602
01:12:39.481 --> 01:12:42.480
<v Speaker 1>so why would an animal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if we back up a little bit,</v>

1603
01:12:42.481 --> 01:12:43.314
<v Speaker 1>remember I talked about how older one </v>
<v Speaker 1>tools which are made even later than </v>

1604
01:12:47.521 --> 01:12:51.780
<v Speaker 1>when we first started walking upright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there even after that,</v>

1605
01:12:51.990 --> 01:12:52.823
<v Speaker 1>all the tools are never carried it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Integrate distance from where they are </v>

1606
01:12:54.650 --> 01:12:57.210
<v Speaker 1>acquired inmate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what you have is an animal,</v>

1607
01:12:57.211 --> 01:12:59.550
<v Speaker 1>just like today's chimps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't plan for tomorrow.</v>

1608
01:13:00.030 --> 01:13:02.880
<v Speaker 1>So a chimp can plan for needs that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>currently feels,</v>

1609
01:13:03.150 --> 01:13:03.811
<v Speaker 1>it can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1610
01:13:03.811 --> 01:13:08.100
<v Speaker 1>I want to go get 'em termites out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that mound all break the stick off.</v>

1611
01:13:08.100 --> 01:13:10.560
<v Speaker 1>I'll strip the leaves and then I'll go </v>
<v Speaker 1>over there and do that.</v>

1612
01:13:10.770 --> 01:13:11.603
<v Speaker 1>But it can't plan for the fact that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>might have that need again tomorrow if </v>

1613
01:13:13.951 --> 01:13:18.240
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't feel the need can plan for it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and humans can plan for unfelt needs.</v>

1614
01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:19.193
<v Speaker 1>And the best example of that is notion </v>
<v Speaker 1>of taking a tool with you that you've </v>

1615
01:13:21.151 --> 01:13:22.470
<v Speaker 1>now used in st.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1616
01:13:22.540 --> 01:13:23.970
<v Speaker 1>I want to use it again tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1617
01:13:24.540 --> 01:13:25.373
<v Speaker 1>so whichever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also a pythagoras was the first one to </v>

1618
01:13:27.961 --> 01:13:28.794
<v Speaker 1>start walking upright was almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>assuredly incapable of planning for the </v>

1619
01:13:32.311 --> 01:13:36.650
<v Speaker 1>future for unfilled needs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it could plan for felt needs because</v>

1620
01:13:36.660 --> 01:13:37.493
<v Speaker 1>the chimp can do that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you think about how would you </v>

1621
01:13:39.481 --> 01:13:40.314
<v Speaker 1>feel if you're about to walk across the </v>
<v Speaker 1>open savannah and you're kind of small </v>

1622
01:13:42.871 --> 01:13:44.850
<v Speaker 1>and leopards and lions are way faster </v>
<v Speaker 1>than you.</v>

1623
01:13:45.030 --> 01:13:47.040
<v Speaker 1>I think the primary thing could feel his</v>
<v Speaker 1>fear like,</v>

1624
01:13:47.041 --> 01:13:47.874
<v Speaker 1>oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get attacked and so I want </v>

1625
01:13:49.351 --> 01:13:51.180
<v Speaker 1>something in my hands to help me defend </v>
<v Speaker 1>myself.</v>

1626
01:13:51.620 --> 01:13:53.100
<v Speaker 1>Let's be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a club,</v>

1627
01:13:53.101 --> 01:13:53.934
<v Speaker 1>a stick something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what I suspect is a part of the </v>

1628
01:13:56.491 --> 01:14:01.050
<v Speaker 1>process is my desire to hold something </v>
<v Speaker 1>in my hand as I'm looking around and I'm</v>

1629
01:14:01.051 --> 01:14:05.010
<v Speaker 1>scared and a bunch of us are doing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I suspect that that's what led to</v>

1630
01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:05.993
<v Speaker 1>played a role in leading to bipedalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There would have been other factors at </v>

1631
01:14:08.041 --> 01:14:11.290
<v Speaker 1>play like persistence hunting and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I suspect that came later.</v>

1632
01:14:11.350 --> 01:14:12.250
<v Speaker 1>So whole actually</v>

1633
01:14:12.250 --> 01:14:16.810
<v Speaker 2>holding a weapon might've led to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>beginning of that just because you don't</v>

1634
01:14:16.811 --> 01:14:18.820
<v Speaker 2>need to be a rocket scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're scAred now.</v>

1635
01:14:18.821 --> 01:14:19.654
<v Speaker 2>You want something to defend yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do we have evidence of them sharpening </v>

1636
01:14:22.721 --> 01:14:24.220
<v Speaker 2>sticks?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will remember.</v>

1637
01:14:24.250 --> 01:14:27.040
<v Speaker 2>So modern chimps who live on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>savannah do sharpen sticks.</v>

1638
01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:28.200
<v Speaker 2>Modern.</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1639
01:14:28.300 --> 01:14:31.180
<v Speaker 2>What do we have evidence of ancient man </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we don't even.</v>

1640
01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:34.080
<v Speaker 2>We don't even have sticks leftover for </v>
<v Speaker 2>rectus.</v>

1641
01:14:34.090 --> 01:14:34.923
<v Speaker 2>We know they must have used them because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're making some pretty complicated </v>

1642
01:14:36.731 --> 01:14:37.564
<v Speaker 2>stones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so surely they were sharpening </v>

1643
01:14:39.041 --> 01:14:40.510
<v Speaker 2>sticks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but all of it's decade.</v>

1644
01:14:40.540 --> 01:14:41.373
<v Speaker 2>So what year did we.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we really don't know when they first </v>

1645
01:14:44.321 --> 01:14:47.890
<v Speaker 2>started attaching these stone tools to </v>
<v Speaker 2>sticks rail,</v>

1646
01:14:47.950 --> 01:14:49.930
<v Speaker 2>waking axes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spears.</v>

1647
01:14:50.290 --> 01:14:53.380
<v Speaker 2>We know that that's happening very </v>
<v Speaker 2>recently by homo sapiens.</v>

1648
01:14:53.381 --> 01:14:54.820
<v Speaker 2>We don't know if it happened before </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1649
01:14:55.270 --> 01:14:58.120
<v Speaker 2>If I had to guess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say that homo erectus did that.</v>

1650
01:14:58.300 --> 01:15:00.280
<v Speaker 2>If you look at the quality of other </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that they've done.</v>

1651
01:15:00.430 --> 01:15:03.310
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this amazing site off the sea of</v>

1652
01:15:03.311 --> 01:15:05.230
<v Speaker 2>galilee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about 700,000</v>

1653
01:15:05.231 --> 01:15:06.250
<v Speaker 2>years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So member humans,</v>

1654
01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:08.140
<v Speaker 2>homo sapiens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's call it 300,000</v>

1655
01:15:08.141 --> 01:15:10.000
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now we're 700,000</v>

1656
01:15:10.001 --> 01:15:10.834
<v Speaker 2>or so years ago and there's this </v>
<v Speaker 2>elephant skull that's been turned over </v>

1657
01:15:13.871 --> 01:15:16.240
<v Speaker 2>so that they can get access to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain's friend.</v>

1658
01:15:16.241 --> 01:15:19.210
<v Speaker 2>This thing is unwieldy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's heavy as anything.</v>

1659
01:15:19.211 --> 01:15:22.480
<v Speaker 2>You got to have people working together </v>
<v Speaker 2>to turn that thing over and there's even</v>

1660
01:15:22.481 --> 01:15:26.170
<v Speaker 2>a log underneath it that might've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>used as a lever to kinda help plop thing</v>

1661
01:15:26.171 --> 01:15:27.004
<v Speaker 2>over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what you got is people are quite </v>

1662
01:15:28.121 --> 01:15:28.954
<v Speaker 2>capable of working together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They know what they're trying to </v>

1663
01:15:30.221 --> 01:15:31.990
<v Speaker 2>achieve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they know how to access those things.</v>

1664
01:15:32.290 --> 01:15:33.123
<v Speaker 2>I suspect that they knew that they could</v>
<v Speaker 2>sharpen the stake or maybe even have to </v>

1665
01:15:36.070 --> 01:15:37.720
<v Speaker 2>put a stone to make it even better.</v>

1666
01:15:38.020 --> 01:15:40.420
<v Speaker 2>It's just that we can't find any </v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence for that.</v>

1667
01:15:40.421 --> 01:15:42.100
<v Speaker 2>At least not yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't there.</v>

1668
01:15:42.101 --> 01:15:42.934
<v Speaker 2>Some certain really ancient evidence of </v>
<v Speaker 2>cannibalism too because of the scrape </v>

1669
01:15:47.561 --> 01:15:48.394
<v Speaker 2>marks inside of skulls and they think </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they were scooping out brain </v>

1670
01:15:50.741 --> 01:15:52.210
<v Speaker 2>matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's possible.</v>

1671
01:15:52.211 --> 01:15:54.610
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen those data,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but absolutely you can see where they've</v>

1672
01:15:54.611 --> 01:15:57.220
<v Speaker 2>used those tools on like the legs of </v>
<v Speaker 2>animals and things like that.</v>

1673
01:15:57.221 --> 01:15:58.950
<v Speaker 2>So you'd see it inside the skull as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

1674
01:15:58.970 --> 01:16:00.930
<v Speaker 2>A human skull that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1675
01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:02.073
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you're aware of that little </v>
<v Speaker 2>person that was discovered just a few </v>

1676
01:16:06.940 --> 01:16:07.773
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was like a decade or so ago </v>

1677
01:16:08.921 --> 01:16:11.530
<v Speaker 2>that on Indonesia and a flores.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1678
01:16:11.531 --> 01:16:14.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think that little person type thing</v>

1679
01:16:15.240 --> 01:16:16.690
<v Speaker 2>using stone tools,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1680
01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:18.100
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those guys.</v>

1681
01:16:18.101 --> 01:16:18.934
<v Speaker 2>So remember there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what happened about one point 6 </v>

1682
01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:23.260
<v Speaker 2>million years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll call it one point seven,</v>

1683
01:16:23.261 --> 01:16:24.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember exactly.</v>

1684
01:16:24.410 --> 01:16:26.860
<v Speaker 2>homo erectus leaves africa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they also stay.</v>

1685
01:16:27.190 --> 01:16:28.023
<v Speaker 2>So you got home rectus basically </v>
<v Speaker 2>colonizing all of africa and you've got </v>

1686
01:16:30.281 --> 01:16:32.380
<v Speaker 2>homo erectus colonizing almost all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>europe,</v>

1687
01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:35.260
<v Speaker 2>all of southern asia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they don't,</v>

1688
01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:37.390
<v Speaker 2>they don't go beyond that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least not to our knowledge.</v>

1689
01:16:37.391 --> 01:16:39.370
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they dId,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

1690
01:16:39.610 --> 01:16:43.330
<v Speaker 2>but they certainly covered all that </v>
<v Speaker 2>ground and an outside of.</v>

1691
01:16:43.420 --> 01:16:46.480
<v Speaker 2>So now you've got homo erectus in africa</v>
<v Speaker 2>and homo erectus outside of africa.</v>

1692
01:16:46.481 --> 01:16:47.314
<v Speaker 2>And of course then overtime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both of them are going to evolve and </v>

1693
01:16:48.851 --> 01:16:52.030
<v Speaker 2>change the ones outside of africa and </v>
<v Speaker 2>depth as neanderthals.</v>

1694
01:16:52.031 --> 01:16:52.864
<v Speaker 2>Those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most recent recent instantiation of </v>

1695
01:16:54.131 --> 01:16:54.964
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ones inside of africa ended up is </v>

1696
01:16:56.261 --> 01:16:58.450
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when we leave africa,</v>

1697
01:16:58.451 --> 01:17:00.940
<v Speaker 2>the first thing we encountered as </v>
<v Speaker 2>neanderthals in arabia,</v>

1698
01:17:01.180 --> 01:17:03.220
<v Speaker 2>because that's the first point of entry </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of africa,</v>

1699
01:17:03.430 --> 01:17:05.790
<v Speaker 2>and so we probably started copulating </v>
<v Speaker 2>with them there.</v>

1700
01:17:05.820 --> 01:17:07.840
<v Speaker 2>We know we started copulating with them </v>
<v Speaker 2>soon afterward.</v>

1701
01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:10.250
<v Speaker 2>So as we left they involved somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>

1702
01:17:10.251 --> 01:17:14.990
<v Speaker 2>They evolved in europe and asia and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>they had evolved from some other type of</v>

1703
01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:16.710
<v Speaker 2>the same ancestors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So our.</v>

1704
01:17:16.711 --> 01:17:17.544
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our great uncle left and our great </v>

1705
01:17:18.681 --> 01:17:21.440
<v Speaker 2>grandpa stayed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the ones who left,</v>

1706
01:17:21.470 --> 01:17:24.950
<v Speaker 2>some of them evolved into those people </v>
<v Speaker 2>on flores to those tiny little people.</v>

1707
01:17:25.070 --> 01:17:28.010
<v Speaker 2>Some of them we know this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dentists sylvan from a pinky bone,</v>

1708
01:17:28.011 --> 01:17:29.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a cave inside Russia.</v>

1709
01:17:30.040 --> 01:17:30.873
<v Speaker 2>And we have got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know that we interbred with </v>

1710
01:17:32.961 --> 01:17:33.794
<v Speaker 2>neanderthals and that's where a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>our genes that we currently have for </v>

1711
01:17:36.321 --> 01:17:37.154
<v Speaker 2>light skin and blue eyes and things like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that come from and they think we </v>

1712
01:17:39.950 --> 01:17:42.020
<v Speaker 2>interbred with denisovans as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1713
01:17:42.110 --> 01:17:43.910
<v Speaker 2>Well not all of us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's some,</v>

1714
01:17:43.970 --> 01:17:47.540
<v Speaker 2>there's evidence for melanesians if I </v>
<v Speaker 2>remember having dennis blood,</v>

1715
01:17:47.820 --> 01:17:49.740
<v Speaker 2>our dna I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about.</v>

1716
01:17:49.740 --> 01:17:51.860
<v Speaker 2>so it may turn out that we did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1717
01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:53.473
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's no evidence that humans </v>

1718
01:17:55.730 --> 01:17:59.060
<v Speaker 2>interbred with the folks from flores.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not that I know of.</v>

1719
01:17:59.061 --> 01:18:00.410
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're tiny.</v>

1720
01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:01.490
<v Speaker 2>They're really good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're very small.</v>

1721
01:18:01.491 --> 01:18:03.670
<v Speaker 2>They're like hobbit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like now that doesn't mean that if,</v>

1722
01:18:03.671 --> 01:18:07.040
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we well know we would have.</v>

1723
01:18:07.250 --> 01:18:08.083
<v Speaker 2>It's possible that we could have </v>
<v Speaker 2>overlapped with them if somebody would </v>

1724
01:18:10.701 --> 01:18:11.400
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1725
01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:15.170
<v Speaker 2>so like we hit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we hit Australia by 65,000</v>

1726
01:18:15.171 --> 01:18:16.004
<v Speaker 2>years ago and I don't remember when the </v>
<v Speaker 2>floor is people we hit Australia at </v>

1727
01:18:18.341 --> 01:18:19.550
<v Speaker 2>65,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>

1728
01:18:19.570 --> 01:18:20.403
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was through some sort of boat </v>

1729
01:18:23.301 --> 01:18:25.580
<v Speaker 2>traveling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So 65,000</v>

1730
01:18:25.581 --> 01:18:26.414
<v Speaker 2>years ago would've still been ice age </v>
<v Speaker 2>and so we would have had a lot less </v>

1731
01:18:28.581 --> 01:18:30.350
<v Speaker 2>water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if you,</v>

1732
01:18:30.351 --> 01:18:31.184
<v Speaker 2>if you look at topographical maps then </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you look at what the pacific </v>

1733
01:18:33.711 --> 01:18:35.330
<v Speaker 2>islanders didn't stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems ballsy as hell,</v>

1734
01:18:35.331 --> 01:18:38.300
<v Speaker 2>but it's a little less ballsy when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can keep seeing the next piece of land.</v>

1735
01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:39.433
<v Speaker 2>Not not as far away compared to now </v>
<v Speaker 2>where the seed is much higher and you </v>

1736
01:18:41.991 --> 01:18:43.280
<v Speaker 2>can't see the land.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1737
01:18:43.281 --> 01:18:44.114
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when the pacific islanders like </v>

1738
01:18:45.410 --> 01:18:47.900
<v Speaker 2>traveled to Hawaii,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think they could see things?</v>

1739
01:18:47.901 --> 01:18:48.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they could see a lot better.</v>

1740
01:18:49.070 --> 01:18:49.903
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The most recent that the very last </v>

1741
01:18:51.351 --> 01:18:52.184
<v Speaker 2>place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pacific islander settled as New </v>

1742
01:18:53.450 --> 01:18:54.680
<v Speaker 2>Zealand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's only 700 years ago,</v>

1743
01:18:54.710 --> 01:18:57.200
<v Speaker 2>so that's the same as today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

1744
01:18:57.340 --> 01:18:58.173
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of that discovery was done at </v>
<v Speaker 2>a time where the seed was a lot lower </v>

1745
01:19:01.370 --> 01:19:02.203
<v Speaker 2>and so there'd be a lot more islands </v>
<v Speaker 2>ticking up that we don't currently have </v>

1746
01:19:04.310 --> 01:19:07.400
<v Speaker 2>700 years ago they had much more </v>
<v Speaker 2>sophisticated boats.</v>

1747
01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:08.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was awesome.</v>

1748
01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:10.230
<v Speaker 2>You records and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1749
01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:11.473
<v Speaker 2>it is crazy when you think about like </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're like little rats with the way </v>

1750
01:19:14.351 --> 01:19:16.970
<v Speaker 2>we've scattered across the globe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you,</v>

1751
01:19:17.270 --> 01:19:18.370
<v Speaker 2>if you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1752
01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:21.200
<v Speaker 2>it seems like it's all ballsy </v>
<v Speaker 2>exploration,</v>

1753
01:19:21.201 --> 01:19:22.034
<v Speaker 2>but I actually suspect a bigger part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>it is running away from the guy behind </v>

1754
01:19:24.561 --> 01:19:25.310
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

1755
01:19:25.310 --> 01:19:27.890
<v Speaker 2>It's causing problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so my favorite example of that is if</v>

1756
01:19:27.891 --> 01:19:31.310
<v Speaker 2>you look at the cliff dwellings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in the american southwest,</v>

1757
01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:33.860
<v Speaker 2>and you go there and thinking who the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hell would live like this?</v>

1758
01:19:33.861 --> 01:19:34.520
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1759
01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:38.450
<v Speaker 2>when junior walks out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if the people down in the valley are</v>

1760
01:19:38.451 --> 01:19:40.590
<v Speaker 2>scarier than the risk of falling outside</v>
<v Speaker 2>uk,</v>

1761
01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:43.670
<v Speaker 2>you're going to live up in a cave </v>
<v Speaker 2>dwelling where they're going to climb up</v>

1762
01:19:43.671 --> 01:19:44.504
<v Speaker 2>to get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's part of the memory we talked </v>

1763
01:19:46.221 --> 01:19:49.670
<v Speaker 2>about sexual selection as a source of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people don't like unfairness.</v>

1764
01:19:49.790 --> 01:19:50.623
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people also don't like unfairness </v>

1765
01:19:51.351 --> 01:19:54.680
<v Speaker 2>between groups because if you and I make</v>
<v Speaker 2>a deal and you know,</v>

1766
01:19:54.681 --> 01:19:58.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm from Ohio and you're from California</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the California has benefit more than</v>

1767
01:19:58.611 --> 01:20:00.530
<v Speaker 2>the ohioans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even though my benefit,</v>

1768
01:20:00.860 --> 01:20:03.410
<v Speaker 2>you benefit more noW I'm at risk because</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe your group,</v>

1769
01:20:03.411 --> 01:20:05.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ancestrally it's going to cause my group</v>

1770
01:20:05.211 --> 01:20:06.770
<v Speaker 2>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

1771
01:20:07.170 --> 01:20:08.070
<v Speaker 2>So when</v>

1772
01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:12.270
<v Speaker 3>you're studying all this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how does that make you feel as a person?</v>

1773
01:20:12.271 --> 01:20:12.781
<v Speaker 3>Do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you,</v>

1774
01:20:12.781 --> 01:20:13.614
<v Speaker 3>do you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Could you ever internalize all this </v>

1775
01:20:14.941 --> 01:20:18.240
<v Speaker 3>stuff when you're thinking about like </v>
<v Speaker 3>all the weird ape,</v>

1776
01:20:18.241 --> 01:20:19.074
<v Speaker 3>like creatures that turned into people </v>
<v Speaker 3>and all the thousands and thousands of </v>

1777
01:20:23.970 --> 01:20:28.020
<v Speaker 3>years of evolution and how it could have</v>
<v Speaker 3>gone left and it did go right.</v>

1778
01:20:28.021 --> 01:20:28.854
<v Speaker 3>And does That freak you out when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>really get deep into the study of all </v>

1779
01:20:32.221 --> 01:20:32.700
<v Speaker 3>this stuff?</v>

1780
01:20:32.700 --> 01:20:34.440
<v Speaker 1>It first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do this all the time,</v>

1781
01:20:34.441 --> 01:20:35.490
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it doesn't freak me out,</v>

1782
01:20:35.491 --> 01:20:36.324
<v Speaker 1>but it's what I like and it also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can talk about all the ways that you </v>

1783
01:20:38.611 --> 01:20:39.444
<v Speaker 1>can predict things about our modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>cells based on knowing these things in </v>

1784
01:20:41.281 --> 01:20:42.114
<v Speaker 1>the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1785
01:20:42.480 --> 01:20:43.313
<v Speaker 1>But secondarily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what freaks me out the most probably is </v>

1786
01:20:45.941 --> 01:20:48.000
<v Speaker 1>the enormous role of random chance and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all this.</v>

1787
01:20:48.001 --> 01:20:50.280
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you think about the,</v>

1788
01:20:50.310 --> 01:20:51.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just think about our own backgrounds,</v>

1789
01:20:51.661 --> 01:20:52.494
<v Speaker 1>the random chance that our mom and dad </v>
<v Speaker 1>got amaris the night that they did made </v>

1790
01:20:55.651 --> 01:20:58.260
<v Speaker 1>you and me if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they did a different position,</v>

1791
01:20:58.261 --> 01:20:59.940
<v Speaker 1>maybe your brother's talking to my </v>
<v Speaker 1>brother,</v>

1792
01:20:59.941 --> 01:21:00.750
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1793
01:21:00.750 --> 01:21:04.320
<v Speaker 1>So it's reAlly which sperm wins that </v>
<v Speaker 1>race is so unlikely to be us.</v>

1794
01:21:04.380 --> 01:21:05.213
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so every roll of the dice has to go </v>

1795
01:21:07.351 --> 01:21:08.184
<v Speaker 1>your way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1796
01:21:08.310 --> 01:21:09.143
<v Speaker 1>And so the role of chance and all this </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of freaks you out if you think </v>

1797
01:21:11.491 --> 01:21:12.324
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>

1798
01:21:12.330 --> 01:21:13.163
<v Speaker 1>But at the same time your brother is </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably a lot like you and my brother </v>

1799
01:21:15.271 --> 01:21:17.370
<v Speaker 1>is probably a lot like me or my sister </v>
<v Speaker 1>or whatever.</v>

1800
01:21:17.580 --> 01:21:21.210
<v Speaker 1>And so you have one child or have more?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got a boy and a girl.</v>

1801
01:21:21.270 --> 01:21:22.103
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1802
01:21:22.150 --> 01:21:24.750
<v Speaker 1>Well you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that they're so different right out</v>

1803
01:21:24.751 --> 01:21:27.120
<v Speaker 1>of the box,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really weird.</v>

1804
01:21:27.150 --> 01:21:29.320
<v Speaker 1>It is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know if you saw this book,</v>

1805
01:21:29.321 --> 01:21:30.154
<v Speaker 1>the ploumen just wrote called blueprint </v>
<v Speaker 1>robert plomin who's a behavioral </v>

1806
01:21:33.241 --> 01:21:35.020
<v Speaker 1>geneticists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen that.</v>

1807
01:21:35.030 --> 01:21:35.851
<v Speaker 1>Our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a lovely book.</v>

1808
01:21:35.851 --> 01:21:40.851
<v Speaker 1>Just came out and just really recently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a month or two at the most.</v>

1809
01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:45.180
<v Speaker 1>How do you say his name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>P l o m I n robert pillowman.</v>

1810
01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:46.193
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a wonderful behaviors geneticists </v>

1811
01:21:49.321 --> 01:21:50.154
<v Speaker 1>over in the uk and this book blueprint </v>
<v Speaker 1>talks about the role of genes and all </v>

1812
01:21:53.941 --> 01:21:55.280
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he,</v>

1813
01:21:55.281 --> 01:21:56.114
<v Speaker 1>he basically is one of these people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's been in the field almost since it </v>

1814
01:21:58.651 --> 01:21:59.484
<v Speaker 1>got started.</v>

1815
01:21:59.640 --> 01:22:00.473
<v Speaker 1>And what they kept thinking is that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment was going to play a huge </v>

1816
01:22:02.791 --> 01:22:03.624
<v Speaker 1>role,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that parents were going to play a huge </v>

1817
01:22:04.981 --> 01:22:05.814
<v Speaker 1>role,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but of course what they keep finding </v>

1818
01:22:07.261 --> 01:22:08.780
<v Speaker 1>over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>there you go.</v>

1819
01:22:08.810 --> 01:22:13.260
<v Speaker 1>There's how dna makes us who we are and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what they find over and over again,</v>

1820
01:22:13.261 --> 01:22:15.540
<v Speaker 1>and this was so disconcerting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is first of all,</v>

1821
01:22:15.750 --> 01:22:16.583
<v Speaker 1>on average,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most things are about 50 percent </v>

1822
01:22:17.881 --> 01:22:18.714
<v Speaker 1>genetic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the bummer is that the other half </v>

1823
01:22:20.791 --> 01:22:21.624
<v Speaker 1>isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't what's happened in your house and </v>

1824
01:22:23.491 --> 01:22:24.324
<v Speaker 1>the way you're brought up by your folks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the random other stuff like the </v>

1825
01:22:26.941 --> 01:22:28.510
<v Speaker 1>first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't even know what it is.</v>

1826
01:22:28.511 --> 01:22:30.390
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's what we call unshared environment.</v>

1827
01:22:30.391 --> 01:22:31.224
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that first girlfriend you had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you biked into a tree and you </v>

1828
01:22:32.990 --> 01:22:35.640
<v Speaker 1>unimproved your face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know a million different things that</v>

1829
01:22:35.820 --> 01:22:39.480
<v Speaker 1>specifically happened to you that didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen to everybody else in your family.</v>

1830
01:22:39.500 --> 01:22:40.010
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1831
01:22:40.010 --> 01:22:44.330
<v Speaker 3>And also the way you address those </v>
<v Speaker 3>things that happen and that could have a</v>

1832
01:22:44.331 --> 01:22:45.164
<v Speaker 3>factor that could be a factor in how you</v>
<v Speaker 3>were raised and how you were taught to </v>

1833
01:22:47.661 --> 01:22:48.494
<v Speaker 3>deal with stress.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How you were taught to deal with </v>

1834
01:22:50.120 --> 01:22:52.910
<v Speaker 3>situations and character development,</v>

1835
01:22:53.110 --> 01:22:53.943
<v Speaker 1>but all the data suggest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not suggest parents just don't matter </v>

1836
01:22:56.290 --> 01:22:57.123
<v Speaker 1>how you were taught doesn't seem to play</v>
<v Speaker 1>a role because when we parse up all the </v>

1837
01:23:00.221 --> 01:23:02.980
<v Speaker 1>different traits about you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a few that your parents actually</v>

1838
01:23:02.981 --> 01:23:05.050
<v Speaker 1>have a big influence on what religion </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in,</v>

1839
01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:07.120
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not how religious you are.</v>

1840
01:23:07.450 --> 01:23:10.990
<v Speaker 1>SO the biggest role that you play seems </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be when sperm medic.</v>

1841
01:23:11.350 --> 01:23:13.210
<v Speaker 1>So a friend of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the analogy they made when,</v>

1842
01:23:13.211 --> 01:23:14.980
<v Speaker 1>when I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I had my first kid is these,</v>

1843
01:23:15.010 --> 01:23:15.843
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what you're going to find out </v>

1844
01:23:17.050 --> 01:23:18.640
<v Speaker 1>that you're handed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the baby's born,</v>

1845
01:23:18.641 --> 01:23:20.920
<v Speaker 1>you're handed a negative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the pictures already been taken.</v>

1846
01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:22.033
<v Speaker 1>You can screw it up by being in the dark</v>
<v Speaker 1>room a little bit wrong or you can help </v>

1847
01:23:24.821 --> 01:23:26.590
<v Speaker 1>it a little bit by being in the darkroom</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit.</v>

1848
01:23:26.591 --> 01:23:27.424
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the photograph is already there and </v>

1849
01:23:29.531 --> 01:23:32.200
<v Speaker 1>my son and my daughter are wildly </v>
<v Speaker 1>different in some ways.</v>

1850
01:23:32.201 --> 01:23:33.034
<v Speaker 1>In some ways they're quite similar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I feel like I'm along for the ride </v>

1851
01:23:35.591 --> 01:23:38.320
<v Speaker 1>more than I feel like I'm shaping them </v>
<v Speaker 1>to make them who they are,</v>

1852
01:23:38.500 --> 01:23:40.210
<v Speaker 1>but don't you think you're shaping him </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhat?</v>

1853
01:23:40.330 --> 01:23:41.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

1854
01:23:41.381 --> 01:23:43.900
<v Speaker 1>that's what we do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the date is say no,</v>

1855
01:23:44.650 --> 01:23:45.880
<v Speaker 1>but how would the data?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1856
01:23:45.881 --> 01:23:47.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so here's how we do</v>

1857
01:23:47.560 --> 01:23:50.740
<v Speaker 3>to study so many different human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to.</v>

1858
01:23:50.820 --> 01:23:54.430
<v Speaker 3>You have to take into account all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>variables that took place during all the</v>

1859
01:23:54.431 --> 01:23:56.050
<v Speaker 3>developmental periods of their life.</v>

1860
01:23:56.310 --> 01:23:58.110
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the it to do it right,</v>

1861
01:23:58.111 --> 01:24:00.450
<v Speaker 1>you need to do all that and we can't do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that yet and to do it right.</v>

1862
01:24:00.451 --> 01:24:03.750
<v Speaker 1>What you want is actually to have that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The actual genetic markers,</v>

1863
01:24:03.751 --> 01:24:07.170
<v Speaker 1>not just to know that the genes are </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and that's all starting now,</v>

1864
01:24:07.410 --> 01:24:08.640
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we don't know yet.</v>

1865
01:24:08.820 --> 01:24:10.170
<v Speaker 1>What they do do is they'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1866
01:24:10.171 --> 01:24:11.970
<v Speaker 1>we got a bunch of where there's two ways</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go about this.</v>

1867
01:24:11.971 --> 01:24:13.410
<v Speaker 1>Employment was at the front of both of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1868
01:24:13.620 --> 01:24:16.290
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at adaptive studies versus kids</v>

1869
01:24:16.291 --> 01:24:17.124
<v Speaker 1>who are adopted into a family versus </v>
<v Speaker 1>biological and you can compare the </v>

1870
01:24:20.700 --> 01:24:21.533
<v Speaker 1>parents of the adopted kids to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>biological parents versus the home </v>

1871
01:24:23.971 --> 01:24:24.804
<v Speaker 1>parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it turns out that the biological </v>

1872
01:24:26.851 --> 01:24:27.684
<v Speaker 1>parents predict a whole lot more about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the adopted child than the parents who </v>

1873
01:24:29.971 --> 01:24:30.804
<v Speaker 1>raised them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The parents were raised in predict </v>

1874
01:24:32.491 --> 01:24:33.360
<v Speaker 1>almost nothing.</v>

1875
01:24:33.410 --> 01:24:34.410
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

1876
01:24:34.411 --> 01:24:35.244
<v Speaker 1>and then the second thing you can do is </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can look at fraternal versus a </v>

1877
01:24:38.550 --> 01:24:39.383
<v Speaker 1>monozygotic identical twins and you find</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the when you then they all share </v>

1878
01:24:44.311 --> 01:24:45.310
<v Speaker 1>the same environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>

1879
01:24:45.350 --> 01:24:46.650
<v Speaker 1>they're all brought up by you and me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1880
01:24:46.651 --> 01:24:50.250
<v Speaker 1>Where the parents of these kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the they also,</v>

1881
01:24:50.251 --> 01:24:53.670
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of unshared environment </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's when they differ.</v>

1882
01:24:53.671 --> 01:24:54.504
<v Speaker 1>It's not because of you and me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't find any evidence that you and </v>

1883
01:24:56.461 --> 01:24:57.294
<v Speaker 1>me that you and I made any difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All we can find is evidence that other </v>

1884
01:25:00.211 --> 01:25:01.044
<v Speaker 1>things in their life made a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not to say that means what we really </v>

1885
01:25:03.601 --> 01:25:04.351
<v Speaker 1>don't know is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1886
01:25:04.351 --> 01:25:05.184
<v Speaker 1>what is that unshared environment?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All we know is it's not something about </v>

1887
01:25:07.141 --> 01:25:11.220
<v Speaker 1>your household because that would cause </v>
<v Speaker 1>fraternal and identical twins to both be</v>

1888
01:25:11.221 --> 01:25:13.620
<v Speaker 1>more similar to each other and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't.</v>

1889
01:25:13.990 --> 01:25:14.823
<v Speaker 3>Well obviously a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's not a lot of data in terms of </v>

1890
01:25:18.761 --> 01:25:22.180
<v Speaker 3>when you're measuring someone's entire </v>
<v Speaker 3>life from birth to death,</v>

1891
01:25:22.690 --> 01:25:25.750
<v Speaker 3>but there's enough that people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>starting to draw conclusions.</v>

1892
01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:30.130
<v Speaker 3>One of the more interesting ones is when</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see identical twins that were raised</v>

1893
01:25:30.131 --> 01:25:33.340
<v Speaker 3>in different households without any </v>
<v Speaker 3>knowledge of each other,</v>

1894
01:25:33.610 --> 01:25:34.443
<v Speaker 3>and then they run into each other 30 </v>
<v Speaker 3>years later and they find out they have </v>

1895
01:25:37.210 --> 01:25:38.670
<v Speaker 3>disturbing similarity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>YeAh,</v>

1896
01:25:38.990 --> 01:25:41.650
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly another example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what's also interesting about it,</v>

1897
01:25:41.651 --> 01:25:42.484
<v Speaker 1>which plum and talks about in blueprint </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that your genes become more powerful </v>

1898
01:25:46.391 --> 01:25:47.224
<v Speaker 1>as you age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the heritability of things like iq </v>

1899
01:25:50.381 --> 01:25:51.214
<v Speaker 1>goes up as you get older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the argument is that your gene </v>

1900
01:25:53.691 --> 01:25:55.990
<v Speaker 1>seemed to be causing you to select out </v>
<v Speaker 1>environments.</v>

1901
01:25:56.200 --> 01:25:57.340
<v Speaker 1>So you gave the example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1902
01:25:57.341 --> 01:26:01.630
<v Speaker 1>maybe the way that you discipline them </v>
<v Speaker 1>or tell them to be resilient or whatever</v>

1903
01:26:01.631 --> 01:26:04.010
<v Speaker 1>you do as a parent causes them to shape </v>
<v Speaker 1>their environment.</v>

1904
01:26:04.230 --> 01:26:07.360
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't seem to be the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it does seem to be the case that the</v>

1905
01:26:07.370 --> 01:26:08.203
<v Speaker 1>genes that you give them caused them to </v>
<v Speaker 1>select their environments in certain </v>

1906
01:26:10.251 --> 01:26:12.560
<v Speaker 1>ways because remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids choose their friends,</v>

1907
01:26:12.561 --> 01:26:14.570
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want them to play with timmy,</v>

1908
01:26:14.571 --> 01:26:16.930
<v Speaker 1>but they want to play with johnny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1909
01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:20.360
<v Speaker 1>that's the unshared environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're making those choices every day.</v>

1910
01:26:20.510 --> 01:26:21.343
<v Speaker 1>It's also the case that their peers </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter a whole lot more than their </v>

1911
01:26:23.361 --> 01:26:25.010
<v Speaker 1>parents do once they get to a certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>age.</v>

1912
01:26:25.370 --> 01:26:27.140
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm chopped liver as soon as my kids are</v>

1913
01:26:27.141 --> 01:26:28.220
<v Speaker 1>a bit older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I'm young,</v>

1914
01:26:28.221 --> 01:26:31.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm their hero right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you.</v>

1915
01:26:31.830 --> 01:26:35.300
<v Speaker 1>When you say that your genes become more</v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful as you get older,</v>

1916
01:26:35.301 --> 01:26:36.560
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean by that though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1917
01:26:36.561 --> 01:26:37.394
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are more predictive of the outcome </v>

1918
01:26:39.080 --> 01:26:41.840
<v Speaker 1>and so if you look at the heritability </v>
<v Speaker 1>of iq when you're a kid,</v>

1919
01:26:41.841 --> 01:26:42.674
<v Speaker 1>it's lower than when you're an adult and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's lower still than when you're an </v>

1920
01:26:44.511 --> 01:26:45.344
<v Speaker 1>older adult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so what seems to be happening to a </v>

1921
01:26:47.061 --> 01:26:49.220
<v Speaker 1>lot of our traits?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably almost usually.</v>

1922
01:26:49.310 --> 01:26:53.660
<v Speaker 1>Are you saying that like if you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>children as an older person,</v>

1923
01:26:53.661 --> 01:26:55.940
<v Speaker 1>it's charitable as the kids get older.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

1924
01:26:56.030 --> 01:26:57.010
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so as a.</v>

1925
01:26:57.160 --> 01:27:00.650
<v Speaker 1>So if you look at the heritability of iq</v>
<v Speaker 1>when kids are two,</v>

1926
01:27:00.651 --> 01:27:01.670
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight,</v>

1927
01:27:01.730 --> 01:27:02.930
<v Speaker 1>10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20,</v>

1928
01:27:02.931 --> 01:27:03.764
<v Speaker 1>60,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you find that identical twins come more </v>

1929
01:27:06.111 --> 01:27:06.944
<v Speaker 1>and more together as they age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether they're aging in the same </v>

1930
01:27:08.541 --> 01:27:09.410
<v Speaker 1>household or not.</v>

1931
01:27:09.980 --> 01:27:12.490
<v Speaker 1>And so There's something about selecting</v>
<v Speaker 1>your environment.</v>

1932
01:27:12.491 --> 01:27:15.500
<v Speaker 1>So like here's one kid who loves to </v>
<v Speaker 1>think of do puzzles and it's identical.</v>

1933
01:27:15.501 --> 01:27:18.050
<v Speaker 1>Twin loves due to the same and they kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of get smarter their whole lives.</v>

1934
01:27:18.380 --> 01:27:20.000
<v Speaker 1>Here's another kid who's not interested </v>
<v Speaker 1>in that.</v>

1935
01:27:20.001 --> 01:27:22.640
<v Speaker 1>They have other interests and they go in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a different direction,</v>

1936
01:27:22.641 --> 01:27:24.200
<v Speaker 1>but when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're the parent,</v>

1937
01:27:24.201 --> 01:27:25.034
<v Speaker 1>you can be busily pushing them to do the</v>
<v Speaker 1>things you want them to do and so </v>

1938
01:27:27.621 --> 01:27:29.640
<v Speaker 1>they're heritability is less strong and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1939
01:27:29.641 --> 01:27:30.474
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of cool examples.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like when totalitarian governments </v>

1940
01:27:32.901 --> 01:27:35.240
<v Speaker 1>are eliminated in the school system </v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes more fair.</v>

1941
01:27:35.420 --> 01:27:36.253
<v Speaker 1>Heritability of intelligence goes up in </v>
<v Speaker 1>those societies because kids are now </v>

1942
01:27:39.081 --> 01:27:41.960
<v Speaker 1>more capable of selecting the schools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to go to the environments that</v>

1943
01:27:41.961 --> 01:27:43.880
<v Speaker 1>they want to be part of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1944
01:27:44.620 --> 01:27:46.340
<v Speaker 1>What we're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're so flexible.</v>

1945
01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:47.233
<v Speaker 1>It's so weird when you think about all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the various styles of civilization that </v>

1946
01:27:51.171 --> 01:27:53.990
<v Speaker 1>human beings exist in and thrive in.</v>

1947
01:27:54.170 --> 01:27:54.641
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1948
01:27:54.641 --> 01:27:55.700
<v Speaker 1>and for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the key.</v>

1949
01:27:55.701 --> 01:27:57.970
<v Speaker 1>So when a lot of people hear about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they sort,</v>

1950
01:27:58.010 --> 01:27:58.843
<v Speaker 1>it sounds like genetic determinism that </v>
<v Speaker 1>your genes are forcing you to be a </v>

1951
01:28:01.371 --> 01:28:03.290
<v Speaker 1>certain way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for me it's,</v>

1952
01:28:03.291 --> 01:28:04.124
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing genetic determinism that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can think of about as a genetic </v>

1953
01:28:06.591 --> 01:28:08.600
<v Speaker 1>nudge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of your nudge is going to come from</v>

1954
01:28:08.601 --> 01:28:09.434
<v Speaker 1>the dna your inherited,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but part of it's going to come from the </v>

1955
01:28:10.941 --> 01:28:13.400
<v Speaker 1>environment and part of it's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>come from your own personal decisions.</v>

1956
01:28:13.730 --> 01:28:16.520
<v Speaker 1>So in my mind we talk about in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your mind,</v>

1957
01:28:16.521 --> 01:28:20.390
<v Speaker 1>because that's what psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but an easier example is your muscles.</v>

1958
01:28:20.690 --> 01:28:21.523
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people inherit genes that if they </v>

1959
01:28:22.611 --> 01:28:23.690
<v Speaker 1>lift one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait once,</v>

1960
01:28:24.500 --> 01:28:27.560
<v Speaker 1>they're both other people's genes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have to work out a lot if they want</v>

1961
01:28:27.561 --> 01:28:28.394
<v Speaker 1>to gain anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can still decide I'm going to </v>

1962
01:28:29.781 --> 01:28:30.890
<v Speaker 1>work out a lot or I'm not.</v>

1963
01:28:31.130 --> 01:28:33.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna eat these nutrients or you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1964
01:28:33.290 --> 01:28:34.123
<v Speaker 1>a lot of protein or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can choose a lifestyle that leads </v>

1965
01:28:36.501 --> 01:28:37.850
<v Speaker 1>you to be more muscular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>less so.</v>

1966
01:28:37.851 --> 01:28:40.270
<v Speaker 1>it's partially choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's partially environment.</v>

1967
01:28:40.300 --> 01:28:43.610
<v Speaker 1>It's partially that interaction between </v>
<v Speaker 1>your genes and environment,</v>

1968
01:28:43.790 --> 01:28:46.370
<v Speaker 1>which would make sense if you think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about how flexible we are.</v>

1969
01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:48.440
<v Speaker 1>AbsoLutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has to be active that we are.</v>

1970
01:28:48.530 --> 01:28:49.363
<v Speaker 1>It has to be because human beings have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to learn how to survive in every </v>

1971
01:28:51.261 --> 01:28:54.050
<v Speaker 1>environment on this planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we were mere cats or something,</v>

1972
01:28:54.051 --> 01:28:55.490
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got a certain way of doing things and</v>

1973
01:28:55.820 --> 01:28:56.653
<v Speaker 1>your genes can basically tell you what </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do and with mere cats there's some </v>

1974
01:28:58.851 --> 01:29:01.140
<v Speaker 1>really interesting experiments where you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can show your genes,</v>

1975
01:29:01.141 --> 01:29:03.180
<v Speaker 1>caused you to listen to one signal and </v>
<v Speaker 1>just follow that.</v>

1976
01:29:03.480 --> 01:29:05.910
<v Speaker 1>But as human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your genes have no choice but to give up</v>

1977
01:29:05.911 --> 01:29:08.730
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once we went down this cognitive pathway</v>

1978
01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:12.060
<v Speaker 1>that emphasizes learning over inborn </v>
<v Speaker 1>instincts,</v>

1979
01:29:12.150 --> 01:29:12.983
<v Speaker 1>you know you've had a little ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know they're worthless when they're </v>

1980
01:29:14.371 --> 01:29:15.204
<v Speaker 1>babies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1981
01:29:15.420 --> 01:29:18.420
<v Speaker 1>Baby willdabeast gets up and off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can go run away from a lion.</v>

1982
01:29:18.640 --> 01:29:22.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just so fantastically complicated.</v>

1983
01:29:23.020 --> 01:29:23.853
<v Speaker 3>The developmental process from birth to </v>
<v Speaker 3>adulthood and that this is taking place </v>

1984
01:29:29.231 --> 01:29:30.064
<v Speaker 3>simultaneously amongst hundreds and </v>
<v Speaker 3>hundreds of millions of people with </v>

1985
01:29:34.780 --> 01:29:35.613
<v Speaker 3>varying results and all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 3>different levels of creativity and </v>

1986
01:29:39.431 --> 01:29:40.264
<v Speaker 3>ingenuity and mathematical prowess and </v>
<v Speaker 3>literature and all these different </v>

1987
01:29:44.201 --> 01:29:46.150
<v Speaker 3>things that are being created by all </v>
<v Speaker 3>these different,</v>

1988
01:29:46.151 --> 01:29:46.984
<v Speaker 3>weird little ape creatures everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's so many different factors </v>

1989
01:29:50.201 --> 01:29:52.870
<v Speaker 3>that determine what this ape creature </v>
<v Speaker 3>becomes.</v>

1990
01:29:53.070 --> 01:29:53.903
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's one of the best things in my </v>

1991
01:29:54.871 --> 01:29:58.050
<v Speaker 1>mind about being a person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if like if you're a dung beetle,</v>

1992
01:29:58.350 --> 01:29:59.183
<v Speaker 1>you got one job in life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>push up all the poor and you can't push </v>

1993
01:30:01.231 --> 01:30:01.811
<v Speaker 1>a ball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a poo,</v>

1994
01:30:01.811 --> 01:30:04.500
<v Speaker 1>that's three times your body weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's the end of the line for you,</v>

1995
01:30:04.501 --> 01:30:06.000
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you're a human,</v>

1996
01:30:06.090 --> 01:30:07.730
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're big and strong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're not.</v>

1997
01:30:07.950 --> 01:30:09.540
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're really smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're not.</v>

1998
01:30:09.541 --> 01:30:10.650
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're really creative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1999
01:30:10.651 --> 01:30:13.120
<v Speaker 1>there's a million ways to skin that cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2000
01:30:13.400 --> 01:30:14.233
<v Speaker 1>and the great thing about being in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>human is that any good at any of those </v>

2001
01:30:16.681 --> 01:30:17.790
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a niche for you.</v>

2002
01:30:17.791 --> 01:30:18.624
<v Speaker 1>You will be beneficial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because we evolved to all work </v>

2003
01:30:20.731 --> 01:30:22.110
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there'll be value in you,</v>

2004
01:30:22.111 --> 01:30:23.730
<v Speaker 1>you're my favorite barista,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're my favorite,</v>

2005
01:30:23.731 --> 01:30:25.620
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you're good at.</v>

2006
01:30:25.621 --> 01:30:26.970
<v Speaker 1>And everybody's good at something.</v>

2007
01:30:27.180 --> 01:30:28.013
<v Speaker 1>And so the thing is that people worry </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the sort of upcoming genetic </v>

2008
01:30:31.321 --> 01:30:32.154
<v Speaker 1>revolution that it's going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's going to be the good and </v>

2009
01:30:33.991 --> 01:30:36.180
<v Speaker 1>everybody else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's just not going to happen.</v>

2010
01:30:36.450 --> 01:30:37.283
<v Speaker 1>Because one of the things that we know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you'll see this if you look at </v>

2011
01:30:38.641 --> 01:30:39.474
<v Speaker 1>blueprint,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you have a kazillion jeans on </v>

2012
01:30:41.580 --> 01:30:42.361
<v Speaker 1>july.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every trait,</v>

2013
01:30:42.361 --> 01:30:45.480
<v Speaker 1>there aren't five smart genes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like a thousand of them.</v>

2014
01:30:45.690 --> 01:30:46.523
<v Speaker 1>And furthermore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each one of them only accounts for a </v>

2015
01:30:47.851 --> 01:30:48.684
<v Speaker 1>tiny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tiny bit and they do lots of other </v>

2016
01:30:49.921 --> 01:30:51.550
<v Speaker 1>things too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can't like,</v>

2017
01:30:51.870 --> 01:30:52.703
<v Speaker 1>you can't make a designer baby that has </v>
<v Speaker 1>all these qualities because all you do </v>

2018
01:30:54.691 --> 01:30:55.524
<v Speaker 1>is noodle around with five or six genes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a couple of disorders that work </v>

2019
01:30:58.201 --> 01:30:59.820
<v Speaker 1>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But our personalities,</v>

2020
01:30:59.821 --> 01:31:00.654
<v Speaker 1>our abilities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our proclivities are all heavily </v>

2021
01:31:02.581 --> 01:31:03.414
<v Speaker 1>determined by large numbers of genes </v>
<v Speaker 1>that do lots and lots of different </v>

2022
01:31:05.521 --> 01:31:06.320
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we're talking,</v>

2023
01:31:06.320 --> 01:31:08.840
<v Speaker 3>talking about our understanding of </v>
<v Speaker 3>genetics currently.</v>

2024
01:31:09.020 --> 01:31:09.853
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you talk about things like </v>

2025
01:31:11.721 --> 01:31:12.554
<v Speaker 3>genetic manipulation or the use of </v>
<v Speaker 3>crispr or any of these maybe new tools </v>

2026
01:31:15.981 --> 01:31:18.830
<v Speaker 3>that they're working on right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've already updated crispr.</v>

2027
01:31:18.831 --> 01:31:20.060
<v Speaker 3>They were crisper point two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2028
01:31:20.780 --> 01:31:21.613
<v Speaker 3>When,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when this continues to evolve and more </v>

2029
01:31:25.671 --> 01:31:29.060
<v Speaker 3>and more innovation takes place in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>

2030
01:31:29.450 --> 01:31:30.283
<v Speaker 3>don't you think they're going to get to </v>
<v Speaker 3>a point where they're going to </v>

2031
01:31:31.521 --> 01:31:35.360
<v Speaker 3>understand all the various factors and </v>
<v Speaker 3>genetics and they're going to be able to</v>

2032
01:31:35.361 --> 01:31:37.880
<v Speaker 3>create a person who looks like thor?</v>

2033
01:31:38.490 --> 01:31:39.181
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes and no.</v>

2034
01:31:39.181 --> 01:31:40.680
<v Speaker 1>So in principle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

2035
01:31:40.681 --> 01:31:41.590
<v Speaker 1>So you've got like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

2036
01:31:41.620 --> 01:31:42.453
<v Speaker 1>3 billion base pairs in your dna and </v>
<v Speaker 1>most of those we all share all the same </v>

2037
01:31:46.411 --> 01:31:47.820
<v Speaker 1>ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So screw the ones that are shared.</v>

2038
01:31:47.821 --> 01:31:48.654
<v Speaker 1>We don't care about those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All we can do is noodle around with the </v>

2039
01:31:50.101 --> 01:31:50.934
<v Speaker 1>ones that aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what makes it complicated is that </v>

2040
01:31:53.520 --> 01:31:57.510
<v Speaker 1>most of the ones that differ between </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are actually non there in what we</v>

2041
01:31:57.511 --> 01:32:00.490
<v Speaker 1>now call the regulatory region.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We used to think of as junk dna,</v>

2042
01:32:00.700 --> 01:32:01.930
<v Speaker 1>but now we know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2043
01:32:02.050 --> 01:32:03.940
<v Speaker 1>think about a company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a company that makes widgets,</v>

2044
01:32:03.941 --> 01:32:05.680
<v Speaker 1>doesn't just make widgets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has to have sales,</v>

2045
01:32:05.700 --> 01:32:08.290
<v Speaker 1>avesta marketing and asset management,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now we know,</v>

2046
01:32:08.291 --> 01:32:09.124
<v Speaker 1>well sure enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the dna that's not coding for </v>

2047
01:32:10.871 --> 01:32:11.704
<v Speaker 1>proteins is working with the other dna </v>
<v Speaker 1>to turn things on and turn things off </v>

2048
01:32:14.980 --> 01:32:16.450
<v Speaker 1>and there's 3 billion base pairs.</v>

2049
01:32:16.450 --> 01:32:18.700
<v Speaker 1>So there's that level of complexity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is outrageous,</v>

2050
01:32:18.710 --> 01:32:19.600
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2051
01:32:19.601 --> 01:32:21.430
<v Speaker 1>but let's still some day we'll get it </v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2052
01:32:21.740 --> 01:32:22.573
<v Speaker 1>It's not you and I won't see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And and what we now know from these </v>

2053
01:32:24.671 --> 01:32:25.504
<v Speaker 1>studies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>g was studies a genome wide association </v>

2054
01:32:27.461 --> 01:32:28.294
<v Speaker 1>studies is that you can look at all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>very base pairs that very and you can </v>

2055
01:32:32.681 --> 01:32:33.430
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

2056
01:32:33.430 --> 01:32:36.160
<v Speaker 1>which one of these things are correlated</v>
<v Speaker 1>with my outcome of interest?</v>

2057
01:32:36.340 --> 01:32:37.360
<v Speaker 1>And so you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2058
01:32:37.361 --> 01:32:38.194
<v Speaker 1>education.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they create what's called </v>

2059
01:32:39.101 --> 01:32:39.934
<v Speaker 1>apologetics score and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's predict how many years of </v>

2060
01:32:42.491 --> 01:32:44.350
<v Speaker 1>education you're going to get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sure enough,</v>

2061
01:32:45.130 --> 01:32:45.963
<v Speaker 1>the richer you are on average,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the higher your polygenic score is it </v>

2062
01:32:49.160 --> 01:32:49.993
<v Speaker 1>you're born into a rich family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You probably have a higher apologetics </v>

2063
01:32:51.361 --> 01:32:52.930
<v Speaker 1>score,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you're apologetic,</v>

2064
01:32:52.931 --> 01:32:57.070
<v Speaker 1>score for education is lower than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>average for your thing.</v>

2065
01:32:57.071 --> 01:32:59.530
<v Speaker 1>You'll probably get poor across your </v>
<v Speaker 1>life if it's higher,</v>

2066
01:32:59.531 --> 01:33:02.290
<v Speaker 1>you probably get richard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that a gene for being smart,</v>

2067
01:33:02.291 --> 01:33:03.124
<v Speaker 1>for sitting there and doing what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>told for self control like it could be </v>

2068
01:33:06.520 --> 01:33:07.353
<v Speaker 1>and there's a thousand things in there </v>
<v Speaker 1>and each one of them accounts for one </v>

2069
01:33:09.731 --> 01:33:10.564
<v Speaker 1>10th of one percent of the variants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what makes it complicated is that </v>

2070
01:33:13.271 --> 01:33:16.000
<v Speaker 1>whole set of genes also predicts how </v>
<v Speaker 1>artistic you are,</v>

2071
01:33:16.001 --> 01:33:16.834
<v Speaker 1>but in a different combination and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>predicts how friendly you are in a </v>

2072
01:33:18.791 --> 01:33:19.624
<v Speaker 1>different combination and so the the the</v>
<v Speaker 1>genes that do one set of things almost </v>

2073
01:33:23.531 --> 01:33:27.170
<v Speaker 1>always do lots of things and we have </v>
<v Speaker 1>very few traits through that.</v>

2074
01:33:27.280 --> 01:33:30.340
<v Speaker 1>don't have lots and lots of genes that </v>
<v Speaker 1>each play a tiny role underneath them.</v>

2075
01:33:30.730 --> 01:33:32.920
<v Speaker 1>The example ploumen gives in his book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is great,</v>

2076
01:33:33.150 --> 01:33:33.983
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we started out looking for golden </v>

2077
01:33:34.931 --> 01:33:37.480
<v Speaker 1>nuggets and we now realize we looking </v>
<v Speaker 1>for gold dust.</v>

2078
01:33:37.750 --> 01:33:39.460
<v Speaker 1>It's just lots of tiny stuff like that.</v>

2079
01:33:39.520 --> 01:33:43.640
<v Speaker 3>They're so in many ways when you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at a one,</v>

2080
01:33:43.710 --> 01:33:44.543
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you talk about the human genome and our </v>

2081
01:33:47.891 --> 01:33:49.370
<v Speaker 3>genetic code,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

2082
01:33:49.380 --> 01:33:50.213
<v Speaker 3>we're really similar to computer </v>
<v Speaker 3>programs and that there's millions and </v>

2083
01:33:54.460 --> 01:33:55.420
<v Speaker 3>millions of lines of code and computer </v>
<v Speaker 3>programs,</v>

2084
01:33:55.421 --> 01:33:58.890
<v Speaker 3>but we know how to make computer </v>
<v Speaker 3>programs so we know what these will.</v>

2085
01:33:58.891 --> 01:33:59.724
<v Speaker 3>We don't need to know somebody smarter </v>
<v Speaker 3>than both of us knows how to make these </v>

2086
01:34:04.090 --> 01:34:05.240
<v Speaker 3>incredible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2087
01:34:05.260 --> 01:34:07.030
<v Speaker 3>that lead to operating systems.</v>

2088
01:34:07.410 --> 01:34:09.450
<v Speaker 1>But now we're writing codeS that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't understand.</v>

2089
01:34:09.660 --> 01:34:10.493
<v Speaker 1>So if you look at neural networks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll be input levels in the output </v>

2090
01:34:12.901 --> 01:34:13.734
<v Speaker 1>levels in the fricking computer decides </v>
<v Speaker 1>how to mix those things together and we </v>

2091
01:34:16.261 --> 01:34:17.094
<v Speaker 1>don't even know what the it's done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And two of them that are learning the </v>

2092
01:34:18.571 --> 01:34:20.460
<v Speaker 1>same thing might get there via different</v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanisms.</v>

2093
01:34:20.510 --> 01:34:24.470
<v Speaker 3>So by that idea or with it through that </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea,</v>

2094
01:34:24.471 --> 01:34:25.304
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't you think that artificial </v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligence could lead to the mapping </v>

2095
01:34:27.021 --> 01:34:31.460
<v Speaker 3>out of the human genome or rather the </v>
<v Speaker 3>altering of the human genome and mapping</v>

2096
01:34:31.461 --> 01:34:33.050
<v Speaker 3>out a different type of human</v>

2097
01:34:33.100 --> 01:34:34.850
<v Speaker 1>look?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In principle it could and,</v>

2098
01:34:35.090 --> 01:34:35.923
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it may and all I would say is that </v>

2099
01:34:38.310 --> 01:34:39.143
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we thought though is that there'd </v>

2100
01:34:40.511 --> 01:34:41.344
<v Speaker 1>be five smart genes that really matter </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the rest are trivial and so turn on </v>

2101
01:34:44.771 --> 01:34:45.604
<v Speaker 1>those five smart once everybody's going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to want that and there'll be five funny </v>

2102
01:34:47.801 --> 01:34:49.030
<v Speaker 1>jeans and we'll turn those on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2103
01:34:49.031 --> 01:34:50.410
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's not.</v>

2104
01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:52.460
<v Speaker 1>and so what that means is I got to </v>
<v Speaker 1>decide what,</v>

2105
01:34:52.660 --> 01:34:53.493
<v Speaker 1>imagine this future world where I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>about to have a baby and I can crisper </v>

2106
01:34:55.331 --> 01:34:57.650
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing and I have to decide </v>
<v Speaker 1>what genes I'll say,</v>

2107
01:34:57.651 --> 01:34:58.484
<v Speaker 1>well I can make them smarter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then he's not going to be very </v>

2108
01:35:00.051 --> 01:35:00.884
<v Speaker 1>friendly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2109
01:35:01.180 --> 01:35:02.013
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2110
01:35:02.200 --> 01:35:05.450
<v Speaker 1>The old trade off against each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could get the big dick gene,</v>

2111
01:35:05.451 --> 01:35:09.170
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't exactly give them </v>
<v Speaker 1>glasses.</v>

2112
01:35:10.280 --> 01:35:12.980
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the thing is that it makes it.</v>

2113
01:35:12.981 --> 01:35:14.460
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we will get rid of things,</v>

2114
01:35:14.500 --> 01:35:16.520
<v Speaker 1>these single gene disorders that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>awful.</v>

2115
01:35:16.580 --> 01:35:17.413
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2116
01:35:17.630 --> 01:35:18.463
<v Speaker 1>But we're not gonna I suspect we're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to noodle around with our smarts </v>

2117
01:35:21.921 --> 01:35:22.754
<v Speaker 1>and our personalitY because every single</v>
<v Speaker 1>change we make is going to have a </v>

2118
01:35:24.831 --> 01:35:26.150
<v Speaker 1>commensurate change somewhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2119
01:35:26.151 --> 01:35:27.950
<v Speaker 1>well I can make a smarter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then he's going to be depressed.</v>

2120
01:35:28.070 --> 01:35:28.903
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

2121
01:35:28.960 --> 01:35:30.400
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2122
01:35:30.670 --> 01:35:32.920
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is a boy,</v>

2123
01:35:33.640 --> 01:35:36.730
<v Speaker 3>that the idea of playing god like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2124
01:35:36.731 --> 01:35:38.280
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's really mean.</v>

2125
01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:41.680
<v Speaker 3>We are playing creator.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even necessarily think we should</v>

2126
01:35:41.681 --> 01:35:42.514
<v Speaker 3>use the word god in that respect because</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's something that's already been </v>

2127
01:35:44.171 --> 01:35:45.004
<v Speaker 3>created.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we're taking this life form and </v>

2128
01:35:47.261 --> 01:35:48.700
<v Speaker 3>radically altering it</v>

2129
01:35:49.110 --> 01:35:52.080
<v Speaker 1>and we can already do that and people </v>
<v Speaker 1>will start doing it soon.</v>

2130
01:35:52.200 --> 01:35:53.430
<v Speaker 1>And we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when I was a kid,</v>

2131
01:35:53.431 --> 01:35:55.740
<v Speaker 1>when we were kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ivf is playing god,</v>

2132
01:35:56.230 --> 01:36:01.230
<v Speaker 1>now it's a triviality that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is crazy what we're do.</v>

2133
01:36:02.410 --> 01:36:03.243
<v Speaker 1>You don't think that this is gonna take </v>
<v Speaker 1>place in our lifetime that maybe Russia </v>

2134
01:36:05.401 --> 01:36:07.260
<v Speaker 1>and China is going to make some super </v>
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

2135
01:36:07.410 --> 01:36:10.230
<v Speaker 1>not too many genes that play too small </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a role.</v>

2136
01:36:10.440 --> 01:36:13.270
<v Speaker 1>And so the thing is that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2137
01:36:14.260 --> 01:36:16.500
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's too hard to mess around with.</v>

2138
01:36:16.501 --> 01:36:18.570
<v Speaker 1>It's too hard to make the to to create </v>
<v Speaker 1>these things.</v>

2139
01:36:18.690 --> 01:36:19.523
<v Speaker 1>There's nO reason that you'd be a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>better off if you just did selective </v>

2140
01:36:21.181 --> 01:36:23.010
<v Speaker 1>breeding and the reality is you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>even need to.</v>

2141
01:36:23.220 --> 01:36:25.050
<v Speaker 1>People already assertively,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mate.</v>

2142
01:36:25.260 --> 01:36:28.500
<v Speaker 1>They already choose partners who were </v>
<v Speaker 1>similar to themselves.</v>

2143
01:36:28.501 --> 01:36:30.510
<v Speaker 1>If they value education,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other person does two.</v>

2144
01:36:30.510 --> 01:36:32.430
<v Speaker 1>If they value athletics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other person does too.</v>

2145
01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:33.713
<v Speaker 1>That works so much better than anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're capable of doing right now </v>

2146
01:36:36.450 --> 01:36:37.283
<v Speaker 1>and when you do these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ge was studies with these polygenic </v>

2147
01:36:38.971 --> 01:36:40.560
<v Speaker 1>scores and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh look,</v>

2148
01:36:41.390 --> 01:36:44.370
<v Speaker 1>you're born into a social class and </v>
<v Speaker 1>suggested to it probably behind.</v>

2149
01:36:44.371 --> 01:36:46.650
<v Speaker 1>You're just kind of low and sure enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get poor across your life.</v>

2150
01:36:46.920 --> 01:36:49.470
<v Speaker 1>You're literally accounting for three </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent of the variants.</v>

2151
01:36:49.471 --> 01:36:50.304
<v Speaker 1>You're barely explaining anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>because even though when we look at the </v>

2152
01:36:52.890 --> 01:36:55.110
<v Speaker 1>behavioral genetic studies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can say,</v>

2153
01:36:55.111 --> 01:36:57.450
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence has 50 percent genetic.</v>

2154
01:36:57.600 --> 01:37:00.390
<v Speaker 1>We can't come close to finding the genes</v>
<v Speaker 1>that actually do that,</v>

2155
01:37:00.850 --> 01:37:05.280
<v Speaker 1>and part of the reason we don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but part of the reason may be that first</v>

2156
01:37:05.281 --> 01:37:06.960
<v Speaker 1>of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's course 50 percent environmental and</v>

2157
01:37:06.961 --> 01:37:10.260
<v Speaker 1>what those random things are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know and second think about how</v>

2158
01:37:10.261 --> 01:37:12.390
<v Speaker 1>you were 3 billion base pairs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many things,</v>

2159
01:37:12.480 --> 01:37:13.313
<v Speaker 1>maybe when those two are in place in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that one isn't in the third one can be </v>

2160
01:37:15.541 --> 01:37:16.374
<v Speaker 1>interactions that really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really complicated levels where you're </v>

2161
01:37:18.391 --> 01:37:19.224
<v Speaker 1>almost dead infinite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's why I don't think it </v>

2162
01:37:21.181 --> 01:37:22.740
<v Speaker 1>happens when you and I around to see it.</v>

2163
01:37:23.810 --> 01:37:24.643
<v Speaker 3>I think you're probably right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then I just realized that things </v>

2164
01:37:27.351 --> 01:37:30.290
<v Speaker 3>like crispr,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which were invented by accident,</v>

2165
01:37:30.600 --> 01:37:33.060
<v Speaker 3>came out of nowhere less than a decade </v>
<v Speaker 3>ago.</v>

2166
01:37:33.061 --> 01:37:34.700
<v Speaker 3>I believe it was less than a decade ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2167
01:37:35.370 --> 01:37:36.780
<v Speaker 1>It's super recent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's outside of the.</v>

2168
01:37:37.260 --> 01:37:37.490
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2169
01:37:37.490 --> 01:37:38.323
<v Speaker 3>And then if you really stop and think </v>
<v Speaker 3>about even the mapping of the human </v>

2170
01:37:41.721 --> 01:37:42.554
<v Speaker 3>genome,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it used to be an unbelievably difficult </v>

2171
01:37:44.901 --> 01:37:45.560
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2172
01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:46.930
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2173
01:37:47.180 --> 01:37:50.420
<v Speaker 3>checking your genetics was </v>
<v Speaker 3>preposterously expensive.</v>

2174
01:37:50.421 --> 01:37:54.680
<v Speaker 3>Now you just spit into a little tube and</v>
<v Speaker 3>send it to 23 and me and they,</v>

2175
01:37:54.880 --> 01:37:55.890
<v Speaker 3>they tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey bro,</v>

2176
01:37:55.891 --> 01:37:56.040
<v Speaker 3>you</v>

2177
01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:56.873
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone in your family is from europe </v>

2178
01:37:58.411 --> 01:37:59.244
<v Speaker 4>and this guy's from asia and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so I could easily be wrong that you </v>

2179
01:38:02.491 --> 01:38:05.730
<v Speaker 4>and I will see it and it's only 10 years</v>
<v Speaker 4>away because competition really,</v>

2180
01:38:05.731 --> 01:38:06.564
<v Speaker 4>it seems so hard right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But things that were competition the </v>

2181
01:38:08.031 --> 01:38:09.780
<v Speaker 4>impossible when I was in grad school,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2182
01:38:09.810 --> 01:38:12.330
<v Speaker 4>the simple analyses we did with our data</v>
<v Speaker 4>in grad school,</v>

2183
01:38:12.570 --> 01:38:15.210
<v Speaker 4>it's just like a phone could do that so </v>
<v Speaker 4>easily now.</v>

2184
01:38:15.211 --> 01:38:17.790
<v Speaker 4>And we waited 24 hours for the mainframe</v>
<v Speaker 4>to give it back to us.</v>

2185
01:38:17.910 --> 01:38:22.530
<v Speaker 4>Kurzweil talks about that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that we really don't see things in terms</v>

2186
01:38:22.531 --> 01:38:25.080
<v Speaker 4>of the exponential increase in </v>
<v Speaker 4>technology.</v>

2187
01:38:25.400 --> 01:38:26.233
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kurzweil believes all this is going to </v>

2188
01:38:27.451 --> 01:38:28.410
<v Speaker 4>happen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>plus more.</v>

2189
01:38:28.411 --> 01:38:29.244
<v Speaker 4>He thinks you're going to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 4>download your brain into a computer and </v>

2190
01:38:31.970 --> 01:38:32.803
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he started ourselves and smarter </v>

2191
01:38:34.261 --> 01:38:34.560
<v Speaker 4>than me.</v>

2192
01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:35.440
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if he's smarter than,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2193
01:38:35.441 --> 01:38:36.274
<v Speaker 4>he's definitely smarter than me and his </v>
<v Speaker 4>research has just turned on the world's </v>

2194
01:38:39.331 --> 01:38:42.540
<v Speaker 4>most powerful super computer designed to</v>
<v Speaker 4>mimic a human brain.</v>

2195
01:38:42.590 --> 01:38:44.820
<v Speaker 4>Won't think I was telling you about a </v>
<v Speaker 4>week or last week.</v>

2196
01:38:45.110 --> 01:38:45.943
<v Speaker 4>That sounds pretty scary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Computer neural morphic computer just </v>

2197
01:38:49.741 --> 01:38:53.940
<v Speaker 4>got a big boost with a million core </v>
<v Speaker 4>supercomputer that took over a decade to</v>

2198
01:38:53.941 --> 01:38:55.560
<v Speaker 4>build.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mother.</v>

2199
01:38:56.010 --> 01:38:57.780
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is the beginning of a movie,</v>

2200
01:38:57.781 --> 01:38:58.360
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2201
01:38:58.360 --> 01:38:59.850
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't go well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but here's the thing,</v>

2202
01:38:59.851 --> 01:39:01.830
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>This movie in this movie,</v>

2203
01:39:01.831 --> 01:39:05.970
<v Speaker 4>this is a whole room full of computers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just like the apollo missions.</v>

2204
01:39:05.971 --> 01:39:10.470
<v Speaker 4>Use the room for a computer that can't </v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck with your phone and this was really</v>

2205
01:39:10.471 --> 01:39:13.140
<v Speaker 4>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's 1965.</v>

2206
01:39:13.141 --> 01:39:14.430
<v Speaker 4>Sixty six,</v>
<v Speaker 4>67,</v>

2207
01:39:14.640 --> 01:39:15.200
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

2208
01:39:15.200 --> 01:39:17.490
<v Speaker 4>they had a room.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This iphone,</v>

2209
01:39:17.580 --> 01:39:18.413
<v Speaker 4>berries that room full of fucking shitty</v>
<v Speaker 4>ass computers and 10 plus it takes </v>

2210
01:39:21.841 --> 01:39:22.674
<v Speaker 4>pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you remember when your kids and </v>

2211
01:39:23.911 --> 01:39:26.460
<v Speaker 4>everybody said everyone will have their </v>
<v Speaker 4>own phone and I'm thinking,</v>

2212
01:39:26.461 --> 01:39:27.360
<v Speaker 4>who the hell wants a phone?</v>

2213
01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:29.160
<v Speaker 4>Like my mom will just reach me wherever </v>
<v Speaker 4>I go.</v>

2214
01:39:29.670 --> 01:39:31.030
<v Speaker 4>She didn't know what a phone could do in</v>
<v Speaker 4>those.</v>

2215
01:39:31.110 --> 01:39:31.943
<v Speaker 4>Nice to have a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this is only from 2005 from a </v>

2216
01:39:34.711 --> 01:39:37.620
<v Speaker 4>netflix special I did in 2005,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which,</v>

2217
01:39:37.670 --> 01:39:39.510
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's 13 years ago,</v>

2218
01:39:39.720 --> 01:39:40.553
<v Speaker 4>but doesn't seem like that long ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I was making fun of people texting </v>

2219
01:39:45.770 --> 01:39:47.130
<v Speaker 4>because uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2220
01:39:47.131 --> 01:39:48.030
<v Speaker 4>hey bro,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why?</v>

2221
01:39:48.060 --> 01:39:50.220
<v Speaker 4>Why are you making me read?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Call me.</v>

2222
01:39:50.430 --> 01:39:50.760
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2223
01:39:50.760 --> 01:39:53.730
<v Speaker 4>you're sending me texts from a fall,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you will fucking call me.</v>

2224
01:39:53.850 --> 01:39:58.410
<v Speaker 4>It takes you four presses to get an s.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was back when you had numbers.</v>

2225
01:39:59.210 --> 01:40:00.043
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then that was also back when people </v>

2226
01:40:02.311 --> 01:40:04.500
<v Speaker 4>thought it was cool to have those walkie</v>
<v Speaker 4>talkies,</v>

2227
01:40:04.501 --> 01:40:06.770
<v Speaker 4>those nextel phones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you remember that?</v>

2228
01:40:07.160 --> 01:40:10.500
<v Speaker 4>That was like a big deal to have a </v>
<v Speaker 4>walkie talkie on a phone that died out,</v>

2229
01:40:10.680 --> 01:40:11.513
<v Speaker 4>thankfully.</v>

2230
01:40:11.700 --> 01:40:12.533
<v Speaker 4>But this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this whole change in the way we view </v>

2231
01:40:15.931 --> 01:40:16.764
<v Speaker 4>technology from 2005 to 2018.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The world is a radically different </v>

2232
01:40:21.751 --> 01:40:22.584
<v Speaker 4>place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the funny thing is that you and I </v>

2233
01:40:23.821 --> 01:40:26.100
<v Speaker 4>both make a living by observing the </v>
<v Speaker 4>human condition,</v>

2234
01:40:26.130 --> 01:40:28.350
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's our job and we both get it wrong.</v>

2235
01:40:28.351 --> 01:40:30.190
<v Speaker 4>Constantly write every day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got that?</v>

2236
01:40:30.290 --> 01:40:31.650
<v Speaker 4>The texting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the hell is that?</v>

2237
01:40:31.910 --> 01:40:32.743
<v Speaker 4>I remember my sister showed me facebook </v>
<v Speaker 4>because she was in an ngo and they're </v>

2238
01:40:34.980 --> 01:40:36.660
<v Speaker 4>using it to keep track of each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2239
01:40:36.810 --> 01:40:38.040
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people don't want to do that shit.</v>

2240
01:40:38.500 --> 01:40:40.320
<v Speaker 4>I'm wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Every time,</v>

2241
01:40:40.470 --> 01:40:41.303
<v Speaker 4>every single time I'm wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I follow quite a few people on facebook </v>

2242
01:40:44.610 --> 01:40:45.443
<v Speaker 4>that are nuts and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go to their pages just to see what </v>

2243
01:40:49.141 --> 01:40:52.650
<v Speaker 4>kind of arguments or getting into like </v>
<v Speaker 4>as a sociological experiment.</v>

2244
01:40:53.140 --> 01:40:58.140
<v Speaker 4>And there are people that are on </v>
<v Speaker 4>facebook arguing about trump or abortion</v>

2245
01:40:59.921 --> 01:41:04.000
<v Speaker 4>or islam or fill in the blank,</v>
<v Speaker 4>environmental concerns,</v>

2246
01:41:04.001 --> 01:41:04.834
<v Speaker 4>fracking.</v>

2247
01:41:05.050 --> 01:41:08.860
<v Speaker 4>And they just fucking argue all day </v>
<v Speaker 4>long.</v>

2248
01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:11.320
<v Speaker 4>It's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You look at their timeline,</v>

2249
01:41:11.321 --> 01:41:13.210
<v Speaker 4>you look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the entries and you're like,</v>

2250
01:41:13.211 --> 01:41:14.044
<v Speaker 4>oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's like 10 hours of this shit in a </v>

2251
01:41:16.840 --> 01:41:18.730
<v Speaker 4>day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they just do it all day long.</v>

2252
01:41:18.731 --> 01:41:19.564
<v Speaker 4>And you just picture this sweaty person </v>
<v Speaker 4>sitting in front of a computer arguing </v>

2253
01:41:23.771 --> 01:41:24.604
<v Speaker 4>with the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never would have thought that there'd </v>

2254
01:41:26.950 --> 01:41:27.783
<v Speaker 4>be people sitting in front of their desk</v>
<v Speaker 4>arguing with people that they can't see </v>

2255
01:41:31.930 --> 01:41:34.330
<v Speaker 4>all throughout the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who thought that?</v>

2256
01:41:34.630 --> 01:41:37.210
<v Speaker 4>Who thought that would be fun?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it is fun.</v>

2257
01:41:37.211 --> 01:41:38.044
<v Speaker 4>I think it's an impulsive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>obsessive thing that people get sucked </v>

2258
01:41:40.961 --> 01:41:41.794
<v Speaker 4>into and I think they're vastly </v>
<v Speaker 4>healthier and happier when they're not </v>

2259
01:41:44.021 --> 01:41:44.790
<v Speaker 4>engaged in it.</v>

2260
01:41:44.790 --> 01:41:45.151
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2261
01:41:45.151 --> 01:41:47.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean the truth of the matter is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this comes back to the past again,</v>

2262
01:41:47.551 --> 01:41:48.384
<v Speaker 1>so you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We talked about all of these </v>

2263
01:41:48.751 --> 01:41:49.584
<v Speaker 1>differences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so one of the really lovely things that </v>

2264
01:41:50.971 --> 01:41:52.710
<v Speaker 1>you can do is look for the past and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

2265
01:41:52.711 --> 01:41:54.390
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how does that manifest itself today?</v>

2266
01:41:54.750 --> 01:41:57.390
<v Speaker 1>And one of my favorite examples is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whites of your eyes.</v>

2267
01:41:57.660 --> 01:42:01.320
<v Speaker 1>So chimpanzees have brown eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The sclerA around the cornea.</v>

2268
01:42:01.760 --> 01:42:03.690
<v Speaker 1>Ours are white.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would you do that?</v>

2269
01:42:03.691 --> 01:42:05.940
<v Speaker 1>Well then advertise as the direction of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your gaze.</v>

2270
01:42:06.210 --> 01:42:07.830
<v Speaker 1>Why would you advertise the direction </v>
<v Speaker 1>case?</v>

2271
01:42:08.060 --> 01:42:10.440
<v Speaker 1>Because what that says is that on </v>
<v Speaker 1>average as a human,</v>

2272
01:42:10.680 --> 01:42:12.150
<v Speaker 1>when I look over there and see </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

2273
01:42:12.151 --> 01:42:12.984
<v Speaker 1>I want you to know that I saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You and I are probably going to </v>

2274
01:42:15.241 --> 01:42:18.780
<v Speaker 1>cooperate to help us achieve whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>the goal is that I just encountered.</v>

2275
01:42:19.110 --> 01:42:22.650
<v Speaker 1>A chimp wants to hide it from its fellow</v>
<v Speaker 1>chimps because it's competitive,</v>

2276
01:42:22.651 --> 01:42:23.484
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2277
01:42:23.520 --> 01:42:25.080
<v Speaker 1>On average,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the hell is over there,</v>

2278
01:42:25.081 --> 01:42:26.790
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to help me get it right</v>
<v Speaker 1>or.</v>

2279
01:42:26.970 --> 01:42:27.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

2280
01:42:27.991 --> 01:42:29.510
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make it harder for me to get it.</v>

2281
01:42:29.530 --> 01:42:32.450
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The chimps ever did our amazingly,</v>

2282
01:42:34.140 --> 01:42:37.160
<v Speaker 1>amazingly groupers and octopi hunt </v>
<v Speaker 1>together and they do that.</v>

2283
01:42:38.040 --> 01:42:38.873
<v Speaker 1>Groupers and octopi work together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the so the group will be over the great </v>

2284
01:42:42.451 --> 01:42:43.284
<v Speaker 1>barrier reef and the fish has gone in </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he goes to the octopus and he goes </v>

2285
01:42:45.490 --> 01:42:47.460
<v Speaker 1>right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one reason.</v>

2286
01:42:47.461 --> 01:42:48.990
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't give a shit about the octopus</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

2287
01:42:48.991 --> 01:42:51.300
<v Speaker 1>but if the octopus goes to get it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't get it,</v>

2288
01:42:51.301 --> 01:42:52.710
<v Speaker 1>it's going to come out and the group has</v>
<v Speaker 1>got it.</v>

2289
01:42:53.150 --> 01:42:55.770
<v Speaker 1>Cooperation always works better than </v>
<v Speaker 1>working on your own.</v>

2290
01:42:55.771 --> 01:42:56.300
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2291
01:42:56.300 --> 01:42:57.133
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So is there real evidence that shows </v>

2292
01:42:58.851 --> 01:42:59.684
<v Speaker 4>that the whites of our eyes developed in</v>
<v Speaker 4>order to indicate which way we're </v>

2293
01:43:02.121 --> 01:43:02.420
<v Speaker 4>looking?</v>

2294
01:43:02.420 --> 01:43:03.920
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in all these cases,</v>

2295
01:43:03.921 --> 01:43:06.320
<v Speaker 1>all we can do is say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's do a little phylogenetic analysis.</v>

2296
01:43:06.321 --> 01:43:07.154
<v Speaker 1>Who's got an and who doesn't?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're the only great ape with whites to </v>

2297
01:43:09.090 --> 01:43:10.100
<v Speaker 1>their eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So 90.</v>

2298
01:43:10.180 --> 01:43:11.550
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get</v>

2299
01:43:11.550 --> 01:43:15.510
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's an octopus that's chilling.</v>

2300
01:43:15.511 --> 01:43:18.640
<v Speaker 4>And is that a group or.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a weird look and spot it.</v>

2301
01:43:18.720 --> 01:43:21.030
<v Speaker 4>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know really pretty.</v>

2302
01:43:21.031 --> 01:43:23.190
<v Speaker 4>It looks like a coral trout to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh man,</v>

2303
01:43:23.270 --> 01:43:25.740
<v Speaker 4>what do I know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look how pretty that octopuses too.</v>

2304
01:43:25.910 --> 01:43:29.270
<v Speaker 4>and they're really fucking love octopus </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they can change colors like that.</v>

2305
01:43:29.410 --> 01:43:30.243
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've gone down massive rabbit holes </v>

2306
01:43:32.191 --> 01:43:35.310
<v Speaker 4>with these things for hours at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at it is changing right now.</v>

2307
01:43:35.311 --> 01:43:36.150
<v Speaker 4>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're watching him,</v>

2308
01:43:36.810 --> 01:43:41.810
<v Speaker 4>so he's sitting there waiting and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fish tries to get out and the guy that's</v>

2309
01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:47.910
<v Speaker 4>really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The way they have the good sense to work</v>

2310
01:43:47.911 --> 01:43:49.570
<v Speaker 4>together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at the octopuses matt.</v>

2311
01:43:49.590 --> 01:43:53.090
<v Speaker 4>It's getting dark.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh cool.</v>

2312
01:43:53.091 --> 01:43:53.924
<v Speaker 4>His skin is so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just changes and morphs as you're </v>

2313
01:43:56.001 --> 01:43:58.130
<v Speaker 4>looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is so bizarre.</v>

2314
01:43:58.640 --> 01:43:59.431
<v Speaker 4>What a crate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't,</v>

2315
01:43:59.431 --> 01:44:00.264
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know that they could do this </v>

2316
01:44:01.550 --> 01:44:02.383
<v Speaker 4>until my friend remy warren came on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>podcast and he had a television show </v>

2317
01:44:06.051 --> 01:44:06.884
<v Speaker 4>called apex predator and within on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>show they would study all the various </v>

2318
01:44:10.461 --> 01:44:13.640
<v Speaker 4>ways these animals would hunt and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>way they would,</v>

2319
01:44:13.880 --> 01:44:14.713
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the different adaptations to their </v>

2320
01:44:17.631 --> 01:44:18.464
<v Speaker 4>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the different ways that they would </v>

2321
01:44:20.271 --> 01:44:21.104
<v Speaker 4>use the environment and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he would try to mimic those </v>

2322
01:44:23.271 --> 01:44:28.271
<v Speaker 4>different ways and one of the things </v>
<v Speaker 4>that they studied was octopus and what's</v>

2323
01:44:28.611 --> 01:44:29.800
<v Speaker 4>that other fish that's like it.</v>

2324
01:44:29.840 --> 01:44:32.550
<v Speaker 4>The cuddle fish,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is also the same thing.</v>

2325
01:44:33.060 --> 01:44:36.320
<v Speaker 4>Octopus is using a clamshell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is he doing?</v>

2326
01:44:37.400 --> 01:44:39.500
<v Speaker 4>He's lounging.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He found that he picked it up.</v>

2327
01:44:39.770 --> 01:44:41.680
<v Speaker 4>Oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a bbc.</v>

2328
01:44:42.680 --> 01:44:45.410
<v Speaker 4>This is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my god.</v>

2329
01:44:45.411 --> 01:44:49.510
<v Speaker 4>The octopus is climbing inside of </v>
<v Speaker 4>clamshell and then he closes it.</v>

2330
01:44:50.420 --> 01:44:55.130
<v Speaker 4>That is bananas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a bbc blue planet where it shows</v>

2331
01:44:55.131 --> 01:44:55.964
<v Speaker 4>the octopus picking up all that random </v>
<v Speaker 4>shrapnel when there's a shark coming </v>

2332
01:44:58.341 --> 01:45:01.490
<v Speaker 4>after it and it covers itself like a big</v>
<v Speaker 4>ball and the shark keeps going.</v>

2333
01:45:01.670 --> 01:45:03.980
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're super smart octopi.</v>

2334
01:45:04.040 --> 01:45:05.330
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they eat sharks.</v>

2335
01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:06.193
<v Speaker 4>You ever see that one?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a video where they found this </v>

2336
01:45:08.451 --> 01:45:11.180
<v Speaker 4>aquarium was having an issue with sharks</v>
<v Speaker 4>were disappearing.</v>

2337
01:45:11.181 --> 01:45:12.014
<v Speaker 4>They couldn't figure out what was going </v>
<v Speaker 4>on and they put a camera inside the </v>

2338
01:45:15.051 --> 01:45:15.884
<v Speaker 4>aquarium,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it turned out that the octopus was </v>

2339
01:45:18.020 --> 01:45:18.853
<v Speaker 4>waiting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just chilling on the rocks till the </v>

2340
01:45:20.541 --> 01:45:22.910
<v Speaker 4>sharks came by and then he would snatch </v>
<v Speaker 4>them and eat them.</v>

2341
01:45:22.970 --> 01:45:25.160
<v Speaker 4>Watch this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really cool to watch.</v>

2342
01:45:25.460 --> 01:45:27.890
<v Speaker 4>He's like do to do to who?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Me don't bother with me.</v>

2343
01:45:27.891 --> 01:45:28.724
<v Speaker 4>I'm just a piece of coral.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just hanging out here being clear </v>

2344
01:45:31.680 --> 01:45:32.513
<v Speaker 4>you like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause he looks exactly even in texture </v>

2345
01:45:37.400 --> 01:45:39.860
<v Speaker 4>like the coral,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is so fascinating.</v>

2346
01:45:39.861 --> 01:45:42.530
<v Speaker 4>But when they found this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were stunned.</v>

2347
01:45:42.680 --> 01:45:45.170
<v Speaker 4>They had no idea that octopus could do </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2348
01:45:45.171 --> 01:45:46.004
<v Speaker 4>Could not only that they could do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that they would eat a shark and at </v>

2349
01:45:49.491 --> 01:45:51.020
<v Speaker 4>the big fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck man.</v>

2350
01:45:51.021 --> 01:45:53.840
<v Speaker 4>It's not though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want to squeeze the thing first,</v>

2351
01:45:54.200 --> 01:45:56.090
<v Speaker 4>but it's an easy fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It looks like.</v>

2352
01:45:56.091 --> 01:45:56.924
<v Speaker 4>Is the thing about octopus though too?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They could sacrifice a technical and it </v>

2353
01:45:59.361 --> 01:46:02.030
<v Speaker 4>just grows back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So really no big deal.</v>

2354
01:46:02.060 --> 01:46:04.820
<v Speaker 4>It's annoying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't even know if it's annoying.</v>

2355
01:46:04.840 --> 01:46:06.110
<v Speaker 4>I mean we're just guessing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2356
01:46:06.230 --> 01:46:11.230
<v Speaker 4>So there's a fascinating animal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a rivet twisted them up.</v>

2357
01:46:12.630 --> 01:46:15.830
<v Speaker 4>It was an amazing case in Australia </v>
<v Speaker 4>where a coolant brown is a biologist,</v>

2358
01:46:15.831 --> 01:46:20.120
<v Speaker 4>had cuddle fish in this tank and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>can signal like an octopus octopus.</v>

2359
01:46:20.121 --> 01:46:20.954
<v Speaker 4>They can do whatever color and in this </v>
<v Speaker 4>tank he's got a bunch of females on one </v>

2360
01:46:23.421 --> 01:46:24.650
<v Speaker 4>side,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a bunch of males than the other.</v>

2361
01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:28.430
<v Speaker 4>So male goes in between them and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>signals to different sides of his body.</v>

2362
01:46:28.431 --> 01:46:29.750
<v Speaker 4>He shows a female,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's male,</v>

2363
01:46:29.751 --> 01:46:33.080
<v Speaker 4>but he shows the males that he's female,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they want to attack him for a sidling</v>

2364
01:46:33.081 --> 01:46:34.430
<v Speaker 4>up to the female.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2365
01:46:34.500 --> 01:46:36.440
<v Speaker 4>How smart is that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's weird.</v>

2366
01:46:36.770 --> 01:46:40.970
<v Speaker 4>it's weird that they split off from us </v>
<v Speaker 4>hundreds of millions of years ago.</v>

2367
01:46:40.971 --> 01:46:42.620
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like as closely related to salary.</v>

2368
01:46:42.670 --> 01:46:43.760
<v Speaker 4>Basically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy,</v>

2369
01:46:44.750 --> 01:46:45.583
<v Speaker 4>but they're so smart and their eyes are </v>
<v Speaker 4>similar to ours and like in the </v>

2370
01:46:49.321 --> 01:46:50.154
<v Speaker 4>development</v>

2371
01:46:50.190 --> 01:46:52.860
<v Speaker 2>actually it's the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there our eyes are poorly designed.</v>

2372
01:46:52.861 --> 01:46:53.694
<v Speaker 2>There's a very well designed so our eyes</v>
<v Speaker 2>have all the detecting stuff is in its </v>

2373
01:46:57.451 --> 01:46:59.820
<v Speaker 2>own way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's backwards and so the light comes in</v>

2374
01:46:59.821 --> 01:47:00.654
<v Speaker 2>and has to pass all the cellular bodies </v>
<v Speaker 2>before it can get picked up by the </v>

2375
01:47:02.581 --> 01:47:03.414
<v Speaker 2>detectors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's aim in the proper direction so </v>

2376
01:47:05.181 --> 01:47:08.850
<v Speaker 2>the shit isn't in the way and we have </v>
<v Speaker 2>this blind spot because the big thing,</v>

2377
01:47:08.980 --> 01:47:11.220
<v Speaker 2>the nerve connection,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't.</v>

2378
01:47:11.221 --> 01:47:12.960
<v Speaker 2>There's comes in from the back where it </v>
<v Speaker 2>belongs.</v>

2379
01:47:13.320 --> 01:47:14.153
<v Speaker 2>So what that tells you is that yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we both started out with some kind of </v>

2380
01:47:16.201 --> 01:47:20.360
<v Speaker 2>randoms light sensitive spot and there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened to work much better if you want</v>

2381
01:47:20.361 --> 01:47:23.520
<v Speaker 2>to turn it into an eyeball than ours did</v>
<v Speaker 2>because evolution can always.</v>

2382
01:47:23.540 --> 01:47:25.410
<v Speaker 2>It only can start with what you got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2383
01:47:25.950 --> 01:47:28.980
<v Speaker 2>But there's work better because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>could see in water.</v>

2384
01:47:28.980 --> 01:47:29.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2385
01:47:29.910 --> 01:47:32.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean because there I think it's purely</v>
<v Speaker 2>random that they don't have.</v>

2386
01:47:32.700 --> 01:47:33.533
<v Speaker 2>We do a great job of getting rid of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>segue of their bodies that are in our </v>

2387
01:47:35.401 --> 01:47:37.230
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what you're it does is it wiggles all</v>

2388
01:47:37.231 --> 01:47:39.710
<v Speaker 2>the time and so if anything's retinal </v>
<v Speaker 2>stationary,</v>

2389
01:47:39.720 --> 01:47:40.553
<v Speaker 2>it's wiggling and equally with your </v>
<v Speaker 2>eyeball you ignore it and so you don't </v>

2390
01:47:43.711 --> 01:47:44.970
<v Speaker 2>even know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have your own blind spot.</v>

2391
01:47:44.971 --> 01:47:47.850
<v Speaker 2>You feel it in your brain does amazing </v>
<v Speaker 2>things to fix the problem.</v>

2392
01:47:47.880 --> 01:47:50.010
<v Speaker 2>If you have a piece of lint on your eye </v>
<v Speaker 2>or something like that,</v>

2393
01:47:50.011 --> 01:47:50.844
<v Speaker 2>if it were literally attached to vinci </v>
<v Speaker 2>would disappear and because your brain </v>

2394
01:47:53.881 --> 01:47:54.210
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2395
01:47:54.210 --> 01:47:57.150
<v Speaker 2>that's irrelevant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so you can't see your own blind spot</v>

2396
01:47:57.151 --> 01:48:00.780
<v Speaker 2>unless you close one eye and then you </v>
<v Speaker 2>sit there with a neutral background,</v>

2397
01:48:00.781 --> 01:48:01.614
<v Speaker 2>you move your thumb across and literally</v>
<v Speaker 2>your thumbnail disappears because that </v>

2398
01:48:05.010 --> 01:48:08.190
<v Speaker 2>spot is just being filled in by whatever</v>
<v Speaker 2>the background and what happens with the</v>

2399
01:48:08.191 --> 01:48:09.024
<v Speaker 2>octopus.</v>

2400
01:48:09.090 --> 01:48:09.923
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have that problem because our</v>
<v Speaker 2>nerve endings creates the bond spot by </v>

2401
01:48:12.301 --> 01:48:13.134
<v Speaker 2>being on the wrong side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's comes in from the back and so </v>

2402
01:48:15.121 --> 01:48:15.954
<v Speaker 2>the whole thing works beautifully.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't have to deal with the blind </v>

2403
01:48:17.671 --> 01:48:19.890
<v Speaker 2>spot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would that be as effective though in the</v>

2404
01:48:19.891 --> 01:48:21.900
<v Speaker 2>world that we live in?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2405
01:48:21.910 --> 01:48:24.330
<v Speaker 2>It's a water area irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's purely,</v>

2406
01:48:24.331 --> 01:48:25.164
<v Speaker 2>it happenstance that the light sensitive</v>
<v Speaker 2>pit that they had started to get </v>

2407
01:48:28.831 --> 01:48:31.050
<v Speaker 2>innovated properly from the back and </v>
<v Speaker 2>ours didn't,</v>

2408
01:48:31.260 --> 01:48:33.210
<v Speaker 2>and then as ours evolved into an.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2409
01:48:33.240 --> 01:48:36.000
<v Speaker 2>of course we don't know this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as far as evolved tonight,</v>

2410
01:48:36.001 --> 01:48:36.834
<v Speaker 2>we just had to find ways around the </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem that all the fancy structures </v>

2411
01:48:38.820 --> 01:48:40.830
<v Speaker 2>that we now need in front of it or in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way.</v>

2412
01:48:40.920 --> 01:48:43.830
<v Speaker 2>Does anything have an eye like an </v>
<v Speaker 2>octopus that lives on land?</v>

2413
01:48:44.700 --> 01:48:45.810
<v Speaker 2>Great question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2414
01:48:45.811 --> 01:48:46.710
<v Speaker 2>I don't see.</v>

2415
01:48:46.710 --> 01:48:50.870
<v Speaker 2>I've read something about eyes that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>think that I got shit information.</v>

2416
01:48:50.920 --> 01:48:53.780
<v Speaker 2>Now you're pregnant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Memory that they have an amazing memory.</v>

2417
01:48:53.820 --> 01:48:55.650
<v Speaker 2>All these shows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These still sore away.</v>

2418
01:48:55.730 --> 01:48:57.570
<v Speaker 2>That's too many shows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2419
01:48:57.571 --> 01:48:59.940
<v Speaker 2>I don't have any memory anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like full.</v>

2420
01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:01.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I'm like a hoarder.</v>

2421
01:49:01.680 --> 01:49:04.650
<v Speaker 2>Like my house is filled with boxes of </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit that I don't need.</v>

2422
01:49:05.730 --> 01:49:08.340
<v Speaker 2>That's how brains work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm afraid how brains work,</v>

2423
01:49:08.341 --> 01:49:09.174
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it must be because like I know </v>

2424
01:49:11.791 --> 01:49:14.370
<v Speaker 2>that there's a lot of stuff in there </v>
<v Speaker 2>that didn't use to be in there before,</v>

2425
01:49:14.371 --> 01:49:15.204
<v Speaker 2>but I also know like it's like random </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that I should remember that I </v>

2426
01:49:17.881 --> 01:49:18.920
<v Speaker 2>don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2427
01:49:18.930 --> 01:49:19.763
<v Speaker 2>Well no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The funny thing about brains is we may </v>

2428
01:49:20.941 --> 01:49:24.210
<v Speaker 2>never forget anything but we just lose </v>
<v Speaker 2>our capacity to access it,</v>

2429
01:49:24.540 --> 01:49:25.373
<v Speaker 2>but the data suggests it may still guide</v>
<v Speaker 2>our behavior and so every single </v>

2430
01:49:27.991 --> 01:49:30.990
<v Speaker 2>experience you've ever had may still be </v>
<v Speaker 2>in there and it guides your behavior,</v>

2431
01:49:30.991 --> 01:49:31.760
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's use,</v>

2432
01:49:31.760 --> 01:49:32.593
<v Speaker 2>it's annoying for you to recall it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it gets in the way of what you </v>

2433
01:49:34.051 --> 01:49:34.884
<v Speaker 2>want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when we talk about forgetting </v>

2434
01:49:36.061 --> 01:49:36.894
<v Speaker 2>what we're actually talking about is </v>
<v Speaker 2>being able to actually retrieve it and </v>

2435
01:49:38.761 --> 01:49:41.160
<v Speaker 2>talk about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not to have it guide our action.</v>

2436
01:49:41.250 --> 01:49:42.083
<v Speaker 2>Well also I can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can retrieve things far better if I </v>

2437
01:49:45.930 --> 01:49:47.950
<v Speaker 2>get access the file</v>

2438
01:49:48.130 --> 01:49:48.963
<v Speaker 3>by someone else's memory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like if you and I had an experience </v>

2439
01:49:51.431 --> 01:49:52.264
<v Speaker 3>like 10 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we went on a camping trip or something </v>

2440
01:49:53.591 --> 01:49:55.930
<v Speaker 3>like that and I forgot something that </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened.</v>

2441
01:49:56.050 --> 01:49:56.883
<v Speaker 3>And you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you remember what happened by the </v>

2442
01:49:57.461 --> 01:49:59.350
<v Speaker 3>creek when mike hurt his foot away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2443
01:49:59.530 --> 01:50:01.410
<v Speaker 2>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2444
01:50:01.510 --> 01:50:02.830
<v Speaker 2>Oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forgot about that.</v>

2445
01:50:02.831 --> 01:50:05.080
<v Speaker 2>And then next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have this memory,</v>

2446
01:50:05.110 --> 01:50:05.943
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so what we've done is you've broken </v>

2447
01:50:06.821 --> 01:50:09.330
<v Speaker 2>the access in and so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you,</v>

2448
01:50:09.331 --> 01:50:11.170
<v Speaker 2>you could literally find the sneakers </v>
<v Speaker 2>were go,</v>

2449
01:50:11.171 --> 01:50:13.090
<v Speaker 2>holy crap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

2450
01:50:13.580 --> 01:50:15.450
<v Speaker 2>And so that's how our brain is designed </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2451
01:50:15.540 --> 01:50:16.373
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's annoying to retrieve when you're </v>

2452
01:50:17.381 --> 01:50:18.940
<v Speaker 2>looking for one thing to retrieve </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

2453
01:50:20.510 --> 01:50:23.320
<v Speaker 2>If it's important or happened recently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it probably should be retrieved.</v>

2454
01:50:23.321 --> 01:50:26.380
<v Speaker 2>If it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let it sit away and it'll still got your</v>

2455
01:50:26.381 --> 01:50:27.214
<v Speaker 2>baby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You won't put your foot in that same </v>

2456
01:50:27.761 --> 01:50:30.370
<v Speaker 2>hole when you and mike go on the camping</v>
<v Speaker 2>trip the next time.</v>

2457
01:50:30.580 --> 01:50:31.750
<v Speaker 2>But you won't even remember why.</v>

2458
01:50:31.870 --> 01:50:32.703
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in likely significant lessons are </v>

2459
01:50:35.500 --> 01:50:38.120
<v Speaker 3>important because there are seared in </v>
<v Speaker 3>your memory of this is a,</v>

2460
01:50:38.170 --> 01:50:39.003
<v Speaker 3>this is a significant point where you </v>
<v Speaker 3>figured something out they didn't know </v>

2461
01:50:41.441 --> 01:50:43.480
<v Speaker 3>before and it changed the way you looked</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the world.</v>

2462
01:50:43.750 --> 01:50:45.160
<v Speaker 3>So this is seared in your memory.</v>

2463
01:50:45.250 --> 01:50:47.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when emotions get involved,</v>

2464
01:50:47.361 --> 01:50:50.110
<v Speaker 2>you tend to have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's much more easily retrieved later on</v>

2465
01:50:50.111 --> 01:50:51.410
<v Speaker 2>because your brain is saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2466
01:50:51.411 --> 01:50:53.900
<v Speaker 2>that's our evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or whatever you wanna call it is telling</v>

2467
01:50:53.901 --> 01:50:56.060
<v Speaker 2>you that it's important that should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>retrievable.</v>

2468
01:50:56.400 --> 01:50:58.130
<v Speaker 2>And and what you had yesterday for </v>
<v Speaker 2>lunch,</v>

2469
01:50:58.131 --> 01:50:59.190
<v Speaker 2>I can never retrieve.</v>

2470
01:50:59.590 --> 01:51:00.423
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the reasons why </v>

2471
01:51:02.530 --> 01:51:03.363
<v Speaker 3>epidemiology studies on diet are so </v>
<v Speaker 3>difficult because people don't remember </v>

2472
01:51:06.641 --> 01:51:09.090
<v Speaker 3>what that day was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The same thing every day.</v>

2473
01:51:09.150 --> 01:51:09.911
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2474
01:51:09.911 --> 01:51:10.744
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the human mind is so fascinating and it </v>

2475
01:51:12.851 --> 01:51:13.684
<v Speaker 3>varies so much and there's so many </v>
<v Speaker 3>different factors involved and whatever </v>

2476
01:51:16.931 --> 01:51:21.370
<v Speaker 3>it becomes cultural factors and </v>
<v Speaker 3>environmental factors,</v>

2477
01:51:21.400 --> 01:51:22.233
<v Speaker 3>dietary,</v>

2478
01:51:22.610 --> 01:51:23.443
<v Speaker 2>and that's all that flexibility that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolved to put us in that special place </v>

2479
01:51:26.691 --> 01:51:28.610
<v Speaker 2>that we are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we made a deal,</v>

2480
01:51:28.611 --> 01:51:29.301
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we said,</v>

2481
01:51:29.301 --> 01:51:30.134
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to start going down this </v>

2482
01:51:30.741 --> 01:51:31.574
<v Speaker 2>cognitive pathway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that means that there's very little </v>

2483
01:51:33.411 --> 01:51:36.590
<v Speaker 2>inboard knowledge and that means that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to have to learn from people</v>

2484
01:51:36.591 --> 01:51:38.690
<v Speaker 2>older than us and people with experience</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

2485
01:51:38.840 --> 01:51:39.673
<v Speaker 2>And that means that and the best way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>learn from them as high fidelity </v>

2486
01:51:41.871 --> 01:51:42.704
<v Speaker 2>copying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if you happen to go off in a </v>

2487
01:51:43.951 --> 01:51:46.010
<v Speaker 2>direction where they use chopsticks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's how you eat.</v>

2488
01:51:46.220 --> 01:51:48.140
<v Speaker 2>You happen to go in a direction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how you eat.</v>

2489
01:51:48.141 --> 01:51:48.974
<v Speaker 2>There's a million ways to do things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we started with the sort of </v>

2490
01:51:51.111 --> 01:51:52.220
<v Speaker 2>argument about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2491
01:51:52.221 --> 01:51:53.750
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't monogamy or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

2492
01:51:54.020 --> 01:51:55.400
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2493
01:51:55.490 --> 01:51:56.323
<v Speaker 2>I'm arguing that by and large it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>monogamy because you've got these </v>

2494
01:51:58.101 --> 01:52:01.010
<v Speaker 2>systems in place that our testicles </v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't big enough,</v>

2495
01:52:01.011 --> 01:52:01.844
<v Speaker 2>we've got cryptic ovulation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means that we can't tell when </v>

2496
01:52:03.801 --> 01:52:06.560
<v Speaker 2>she's fertile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means that we have to be available</v>

2497
01:52:06.561 --> 01:52:07.394
<v Speaker 2>sexually interested in available all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time so we can make sure we're the </v>

2498
01:52:09.291 --> 01:52:10.124
<v Speaker 2>father.</v>

2499
01:52:10.130 --> 01:52:12.500
<v Speaker 2>And so that allows her to pair bond with</v>
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>

2500
01:52:12.501 --> 01:52:15.980
<v Speaker 2>And there's some evidence that orgasm is</v>
<v Speaker 2>a pair bonding experience,</v>

2501
01:52:15.981 --> 01:52:18.020
<v Speaker 2>certainly for females,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably for males.</v>

2502
01:52:18.200 --> 01:52:21.380
<v Speaker 2>it works in lots of animals via oxytocin</v>
<v Speaker 2>and vasopressin,</v>

2503
01:52:21.381 --> 01:52:22.510
<v Speaker 2>all that kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2504
01:52:23.060 --> 01:52:23.893
<v Speaker 2>So all that suggests that probably on </v>
<v Speaker 2>average that we evolved to do it this </v>

2505
01:52:27.171 --> 01:52:28.004
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're so super dooper flexible that </v>

2506
01:52:29.451 --> 01:52:30.680
<v Speaker 2>went.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another society says,</v>

2507
01:52:30.681 --> 01:52:31.011
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2508
01:52:31.011 --> 01:52:33.440
<v Speaker 2>this works for us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Off we go and we find a way to make that</v>

2509
01:52:33.441 --> 01:52:36.290
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are there studies that compared testicle</v>

2510
01:52:36.291 --> 01:52:38.990
<v Speaker 2>size of different civilizations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>different cultures?</v>

2511
01:52:39.050 --> 01:52:41.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a lot of argument about this.</v>

2512
01:52:41.421 --> 01:52:44.150
<v Speaker 2>And the problem is that the prince,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's racist,</v>

2513
01:52:44.180 --> 01:52:46.190
<v Speaker 2>it's racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what underlies</v>

2514
01:52:46.190 --> 01:52:48.050
<v Speaker 1>a lot of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we get this right,</v>

2515
01:52:48.110 --> 01:52:50.010
<v Speaker 1>so the thing is that that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2516
01:52:50.390 --> 01:52:51.223
<v Speaker 1>the genetics that explain why one animal</v>
<v Speaker 1>or one species would have large </v>

2517
01:52:54.381 --> 01:52:57.290
<v Speaker 1>testicles and other a small testicles </v>
<v Speaker 1>are not the genetics.</v>

2518
01:52:57.291 --> 01:53:00.140
<v Speaker 1>That would explain why two different </v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals in the same species would be</v>

2519
01:53:00.141 --> 01:53:02.840
<v Speaker 1>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the only way to make that latter</v>

2520
01:53:02.841 --> 01:53:05.660
<v Speaker 1>one work is you have to inherit a </v>
<v Speaker 1>constellation of traits.</v>

2521
01:53:05.870 --> 01:53:06.703
<v Speaker 1>So if I'm an inherit the genes for big </v>
<v Speaker 1>balls and for impulsiveness and for </v>

2522
01:53:11.390 --> 01:53:14.210
<v Speaker 1>having lots of kids and not caring much </v>
<v Speaker 1>about him and all of the things that are</v>

2523
01:53:14.211 --> 01:53:16.040
<v Speaker 1>supposedly go with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that do.</v>

2524
01:53:16.041 --> 01:53:16.874
<v Speaker 1>When you look between species,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no way for the constellation of </v>

2525
01:53:19.311 --> 01:53:22.070
<v Speaker 1>traits to be inherited together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because remember I was talking about how</v>

2526
01:53:22.071 --> 01:53:22.904
<v Speaker 1>polygenic everything is and so they'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>all literally need to sit next to each </v>

2527
01:53:25.791 --> 01:53:26.630
<v Speaker 1>other on the chromosome.</v>

2528
01:53:26.630 --> 01:53:30.170
<v Speaker 1>If they've got any chance of being </v>
<v Speaker 1>passed on as a package and they don't.</v>

2529
01:53:30.350 --> 01:53:32.180
<v Speaker 1>And you also get all the shifting around</v>
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>

2530
01:53:32.181 --> 01:53:33.014
<v Speaker 1>In meiosis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember the term for off the </v>

2531
01:53:35.361 --> 01:53:39.110
<v Speaker 1>top of my head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but where the pieces of genetic material</v>

2532
01:53:39.111 --> 01:53:39.944
<v Speaker 1>move around and that virtually </v>
<v Speaker 1>guarantees that you're not going to </v>

2533
01:53:41.481 --> 01:53:42.314
<v Speaker 1>inherit this huge constellation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>traits within a species between species </v>

2534
01:53:45.771 --> 01:53:46.840
<v Speaker 1>is dead easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2535
01:53:46.841 --> 01:53:49.730
<v Speaker 1>you're A species inherits big testicles </v>
<v Speaker 1>and inherits impulsiveness.</v>

2536
01:53:49.731 --> 01:53:51.540
<v Speaker 1>It inherits whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2537
01:53:51.700 --> 01:53:52.533
<v Speaker 1>and our strategy just reproduce it down </v>
<v Speaker 1>and ignore them in all that kind of </v>

2538
01:53:55.401 --> 01:53:56.234
<v Speaker 1>stuff's dead easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so cim fathers don't pay any </v>

2539
01:53:58.101 --> 01:53:58.934
<v Speaker 1>attention to chimp babies to speak of </v>
<v Speaker 1>because while that's their mating </v>

2540
01:54:01.701 --> 01:54:02.534
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2541
01:54:02.750 --> 01:54:03.583
<v Speaker 1>Whereas I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got pair bonded gibbons and </v>

2542
01:54:05.661 --> 01:54:07.580
<v Speaker 1>things and now parents start to play a </v>
<v Speaker 1>much bigger.</v>

2543
01:54:07.730 --> 01:54:09.350
<v Speaker 1>Even male parents start to play a bigger</v>
<v Speaker 1>role,</v>

2544
01:54:09.351 --> 01:54:10.184
<v Speaker 1>but there's no studies that show that </v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings with archer testicles tend </v>

2545
01:54:12.921 --> 01:54:13.850
<v Speaker 1>to ignore their children.</v>

2546
01:54:14.150 --> 01:54:14.983
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this is just that people have tried </v>

2547
01:54:15.801 --> 01:54:17.250
<v Speaker 1>to show that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but here's the problem.</v>

2548
01:54:17.251 --> 01:54:21.320
<v Speaker 1>And tried to show that in studies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So lots of people make that argument and</v>

2549
01:54:21.321 --> 01:54:23.240
<v Speaker 1>it's called life history strategies </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you say,</v>

2550
01:54:23.241 --> 01:54:25.100
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to develop one life history</v>

2551
01:54:25.101 --> 01:54:28.310
<v Speaker 1>strategy in these circumstances and </v>
<v Speaker 1>another and these other circumstances.</v>

2552
01:54:28.640 --> 01:54:31.790
<v Speaker 1>The problem is that you end up with </v>
<v Speaker 1>ethnic differences in testicle size,</v>

2553
01:54:31.791 --> 01:54:36.791
<v Speaker 1>which we know exist and you also have </v>
<v Speaker 1>ethnic differences in where in the kinds</v>

2554
01:54:37.011 --> 01:54:37.844
<v Speaker 1>of lives that people currently lead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The difficult thing is it's super easy </v>

2555
01:54:40.461 --> 01:54:41.294
<v Speaker 1>to look at the world we are in right now</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is what tripped me up earlier </v>

2556
01:54:43.401 --> 01:54:44.234
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You look at the world that we are right </v>

2557
01:54:45.231 --> 01:54:45.831
<v Speaker 1>now and assume,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2558
01:54:45.831 --> 01:54:48.170
<v Speaker 1>that's the way things have always been </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they haven't,</v>

2559
01:54:48.380 --> 01:54:52.530
<v Speaker 1>and so right now you know the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mathematics used for awhile.</v>

2560
01:54:52.600 --> 01:54:55.250
<v Speaker 1>They're the best math in the world was </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking place in the arabic world.</v>

2561
01:54:55.460 --> 01:54:57.260
<v Speaker 1>Now it's not anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so if you,</v>

2562
01:54:57.470 --> 01:54:58.730
<v Speaker 1>if you don't know that past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd say,</v>

2563
01:54:58.731 --> 01:54:59.564
<v Speaker 1>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in the arabic world aren't as </v>

2564
01:55:00.711 --> 01:55:01.544
<v Speaker 1>good at mathematics and they have these </v>
<v Speaker 1>qualities and that you'd make an </v>

2565
01:55:03.411 --> 01:55:04.244
<v Speaker 1>inference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right now the ethnic differences in </v>

2566
01:55:06.231 --> 01:55:08.330
<v Speaker 1>testicles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe,</v>

2567
01:55:08.331 --> 01:55:11.180
<v Speaker 1>but I can't promise you that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's some different.</v>

2568
01:55:11.181 --> 01:55:14.840
<v Speaker 1>West african groups happen to have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>largest testicle size on average.</v>

2569
01:55:15.710 --> 01:55:18.410
<v Speaker 1>Those west african groups tend to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>poorer right now.</v>

2570
01:55:18.500 --> 01:55:19.333
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of things about life that </v>
<v Speaker 1>go with being poor that looked like and </v>

2571
01:55:22.041 --> 01:55:22.874
<v Speaker 1>our strategy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having lots of kids and paying less </v>

2572
01:55:24.171 --> 01:55:27.290
<v Speaker 1>attention to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what you're probably looking at is a</v>

2573
01:55:27.310 --> 01:55:28.143
<v Speaker 1>coincidental association between some </v>
<v Speaker 1>biology and some part of some way that </v>

2574
01:55:32.241 --> 01:55:33.074
<v Speaker 1>your your people happen to live that </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't exist a while ago and that won't </v>

2575
01:55:35.931 --> 01:55:36.764
<v Speaker 1>exist awhile from now and so it's really</v>
<v Speaker 1>easy to try to use this research which </v>

2576
01:55:40.490 --> 01:55:42.440
<v Speaker 1>people have to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2577
01:55:42.650 --> 01:55:43.483
<v Speaker 1>you've got primitive people who have big</v>
<v Speaker 1>testicles and low parental effort and </v>

2578
01:55:46.651 --> 01:55:47.484
<v Speaker 1>you've got some more sophisticated </v>
<v Speaker 1>people with smaller testicles and high </v>

2579
01:55:49.421 --> 01:55:51.750
<v Speaker 1>parental effort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's genetically super naive.</v>

2580
01:55:52.280 --> 01:55:54.350
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that I learned when I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was in rome,</v>

2581
01:55:54.650 --> 01:55:57.290
<v Speaker 3>we took a tour of the vatican by this </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy who's a professor.</v>

2582
01:55:57.291 --> 01:56:01.340
<v Speaker 3>It was really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was cool because we have a,</v>

2583
01:56:01.430 --> 01:56:06.430
<v Speaker 3>a really enthusiastic guide and who who </v>
<v Speaker 3>could explain a lot of things to you and</v>

2584
01:56:06.680 --> 01:56:07.513
<v Speaker 3>he was really excited that me and my </v>
<v Speaker 3>family were very curious about these </v>

2585
01:56:09.891 --> 01:56:10.724
<v Speaker 3>things too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but one of the things that he said that </v>

2586
01:56:11.451 --> 01:56:12.350
<v Speaker 3>was really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

2587
01:56:12.740 --> 01:56:13.640
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

2588
01:56:13.641 --> 01:56:17.150
<v Speaker 3>why all the dudes have little dicks like</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's going on with that?</v>

2589
01:56:17.450 --> 01:56:22.450
<v Speaker 3>And he said that they believed that if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you had a large penis,</v>

2590
01:56:22.640 --> 01:56:23.473
<v Speaker 3>that large penises were a symbol of </v>
<v Speaker 3>barbaric behavior and that these were </v>

2591
01:56:29.241 --> 01:56:30.074
<v Speaker 3>crude or people and that to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be thought to be a sophisticated </v>

2592
01:56:34.611 --> 01:56:36.410
<v Speaker 3>person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you wanted a smaller penis.</v>

2593
01:56:36.411 --> 01:56:37.244
<v Speaker 3>So they actually accentuated smaller </v>
<v Speaker 3>penises in their gods and smaller </v>

2594
01:56:41.031 --> 01:56:42.200
<v Speaker 3>penises in their statute.</v>

2595
01:56:42.260 --> 01:56:43.220
<v Speaker 1>And that's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2596
01:56:43.221 --> 01:56:44.930
<v Speaker 1>you can see these kinds of things all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

2597
01:56:45.170 --> 01:56:47.560
<v Speaker 1>So early pre western contact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2598
01:56:47.630 --> 01:56:49.790
<v Speaker 1>if you look At japanese women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're pins,</v>

2599
01:56:49.920 --> 01:56:50.753
<v Speaker 1>they're painted with their eyes as </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrow of a slit as possible post </v>

2600
01:56:53.121 --> 01:56:53.954
<v Speaker 1>western contact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the women want more almond shaped </v>

2601
01:56:55.431 --> 01:56:56.264
<v Speaker 1>eyes and so they start painting them </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the beautiful women have bigger </v>

2602
01:56:58.191 --> 01:56:59.024
<v Speaker 1>eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These things can change all over the </v>

2603
01:57:00.051 --> 01:57:00.884
<v Speaker 1>map.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I personally suspect that large penis </v>

2604
01:57:02.841 --> 01:57:04.880
<v Speaker 1>size is also a product of sexual </v>
<v Speaker 1>selection.</v>

2605
01:57:05.090 --> 01:57:07.520
<v Speaker 1>So it's more fun for her if he's got a </v>
<v Speaker 1>larger penis,</v>

2606
01:57:07.521 --> 01:57:10.640
<v Speaker 1>they're having sex for longer and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>regularly because is hidden.</v>

2607
01:57:10.790 --> 01:57:11.623
<v Speaker 1>So he has to be available at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she has to be available all the time </v>

2608
01:57:14.031 --> 01:57:16.820
<v Speaker 1>or the system doesn't work and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>what creates pair bonding.</v>

2609
01:57:17.390 --> 01:57:19.460
<v Speaker 1>So humans copulating for a very long </v>
<v Speaker 1>period of time.</v>

2610
01:57:19.461 --> 01:57:20.294
<v Speaker 1>If you compare this to the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>primates with the single exception of </v>

2611
01:57:22.341 --> 01:57:23.174
<v Speaker 1>bonobos and we have way bigger penises </v>
<v Speaker 1>than any of the other great apes and I </v>

2612
01:57:27.681 --> 01:57:29.840
<v Speaker 1>suspect that that's something that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>female.</v>

2613
01:57:29.841 --> 01:57:31.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say why are men so obsessed with</v>

2614
01:57:31.641 --> 01:57:32.474
<v Speaker 1>the penis size?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I suspect that there the creator of </v>

2615
01:57:33.981 --> 01:57:35.600
<v Speaker 1>it and that's why we're so obsessed with</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2616
01:57:35.800 --> 01:57:40.450
<v Speaker 3>Women who say that are playing games,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they know that's ridiculous.</v>

2617
01:57:41.200 --> 01:57:44.500
<v Speaker 3>I don't know that they are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're definitely playing games.</v>

2618
01:57:44.920 --> 01:57:45.753
<v Speaker 3>That's like men who are saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why are women so obsessed with big </v>

2619
01:57:47.801 --> 01:57:49.510
<v Speaker 3>breasts?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't even care.</v>

2620
01:57:50.050 --> 01:57:50.883
<v Speaker 3>I've never met a guy who said that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some some asshole out there that's </v>

2621
01:57:53.321 --> 01:57:54.500
<v Speaker 3>playing games.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2622
01:57:54.520 --> 01:57:55.580
<v Speaker 3>Possibly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're right.</v>

2623
01:57:57.820 --> 01:57:58.653
<v Speaker 3>It is fascinating when you think about </v>
<v Speaker 3>all these different things that lead to </v>

2624
01:58:01.421 --> 01:58:02.254
<v Speaker 3>natural selection and the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so many variables that are in </v>

2625
01:58:04.871 --> 01:58:09.250
<v Speaker 3>place and that we're trying to find out </v>
<v Speaker 3>what is better and what is not.</v>

2626
01:58:09.251 --> 01:58:10.084
<v Speaker 3>And if you have a study and this study </v>
<v Speaker 3>finds genetic differences and ethnic </v>

2627
01:58:13.691 --> 01:58:15.500
<v Speaker 3>genetic differences there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

2628
01:58:15.800 --> 01:58:18.040
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of blowback and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>pushback against.</v>

2629
01:58:18.280 --> 01:58:19.051
<v Speaker 1>There will be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2630
01:58:19.051 --> 01:58:19.884
<v Speaker 1>and one of the interesting things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we do know is if you think about how </v>

2631
01:58:22.421 --> 01:58:27.160
<v Speaker 1>homosapiens evolved in africa and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>small percentage of us left,</v>

2632
01:58:27.370 --> 01:58:29.320
<v Speaker 1>which means the majority of us didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2633
01:58:29.321 --> 01:58:32.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's few randoms who lived up </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the top right hand corner,</v>

2634
01:58:32.051 --> 01:58:32.884
<v Speaker 1>we're available to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means that all the rest of the </v>

2635
01:58:34.811 --> 01:58:35.644
<v Speaker 1>earth comes out of a few small </v>
<v Speaker 1>percentage of the population that could </v>

2636
01:58:37.960 --> 01:58:38.793
<v Speaker 1>have left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we now know there's enormous </v>

2637
01:58:41.140 --> 01:58:42.430
<v Speaker 1>genetic variation</v>

2638
01:58:42.430 --> 01:58:45.490
<v Speaker 2>within africa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way more genetic variation within africa</v>

2639
01:58:45.491 --> 01:58:46.324
<v Speaker 2>than outside of africa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then between any two people are chinese </v>

2640
01:58:49.151 --> 01:58:49.984
<v Speaker 2>person in a norwegian prison are much </v>
<v Speaker 2>more closely related to each other </v>

2641
01:58:53.351 --> 01:58:57.190
<v Speaker 2>genetically then an african guy who </v>
<v Speaker 2>lives in the next village over.</v>

2642
01:58:57.580 --> 01:59:00.670
<v Speaker 2>And because most of the genetic </v>
<v Speaker 2>variability never left the continent.</v>

2643
01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:05.470
<v Speaker 2>And so we had this idea of race as if it</v>
<v Speaker 2>has genetic meaning and it doesn't.</v>

2644
01:59:05.800 --> 01:59:08.530
<v Speaker 2>But ethnicity does have genetic meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2645
01:59:08.650 --> 01:59:09.483
<v Speaker 2>So an ethnic group evolved in a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain spot to deal with very certain </v>

2646
01:59:12.491 --> 01:59:13.324
<v Speaker 2>problems and their body shape will vary </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you've got these west africans or a </v>

2647
01:59:16.120 --> 01:59:19.420
<v Speaker 2>really jacked with these big muscle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of quick jerk musculature.</v>

2648
01:59:19.720 --> 01:59:21.820
<v Speaker 2>You don't see that over on east africa </v>
<v Speaker 2>very much.</v>

2649
01:59:22.130 --> 01:59:22.963
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got a tall people in Denmark you </v>

2650
01:59:25.061 --> 01:59:26.530
<v Speaker 2>don't see that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2651
01:59:26.531 --> 01:59:27.860
<v Speaker 2>in other parts of europe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>etc.</v>

2652
01:59:27.940 --> 01:59:31.020
<v Speaker 2>So people are the adaptation with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>nun to deal with the cold climate.</v>

2653
01:59:31.030 --> 01:59:31.863
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>

2654
01:59:31.890 --> 01:59:34.990
<v Speaker 2>and lots of that sanitation and a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just random genetic drift,</v>

2655
01:59:34.991 --> 01:59:38.170
<v Speaker 2>a founder population,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other causes that aren't evolved but</v>

2656
01:59:38.171 --> 01:59:41.020
<v Speaker 2>nonetheless have a big impact on what </v>
<v Speaker 2>the population ends up looking like.</v>

2657
01:59:41.290 --> 01:59:44.650
<v Speaker 2>It's just so amazing to consider that </v>
<v Speaker 2>this entire species essentially,</v>

2658
01:59:44.651 --> 01:59:46.750
<v Speaker 2>except for the times that We interacted </v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

2659
01:59:46.830 --> 01:59:47.663
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>interbred with neanderthals came from </v>

2660
01:59:49.991 --> 01:59:51.910
<v Speaker 2>one part of africa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2661
01:59:52.040 --> 01:59:52.873
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the reasons why racism is </v>
<v Speaker 2>so preposterous because we're </v>

2662
01:59:54.761 --> 01:59:57.250
<v Speaker 2>essentially all africans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are all africans.</v>

2663
01:59:57.290 --> 02:00:00.010
<v Speaker 2>We've all of us who are out have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit of other stuff in the us,</v>

2664
02:00:00.011 --> 02:00:01.540
<v Speaker 2>but just a tiny bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

2665
02:00:01.550 --> 02:00:02.730
<v Speaker 2>so weird though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're so,</v>

2666
02:00:02.780 --> 02:00:04.690
<v Speaker 2>we're so much like dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2667
02:00:04.691 --> 02:00:07.180
<v Speaker 2>like a great dane can breed with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>poodle.</v>

2668
02:00:07.520 --> 02:00:08.830
<v Speaker 2>They DoN't look Anything like each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>

2669
02:00:08.890 --> 02:00:10.480
<v Speaker 2>So were from another planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go,</v>

2670
02:00:10.481 --> 02:00:11.314
<v Speaker 2>well that's definitely true.</v>

2671
02:00:12.370 --> 02:00:13.203
<v Speaker 2>or that's not gonna happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like if you looked at lebron james </v>

2672
02:00:15.731 --> 02:00:17.090
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2673
02:00:18.160 --> 02:00:19.480
<v Speaker 2>traci lords,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2674
02:00:19.510 --> 02:00:21.160
<v Speaker 2>They look like two different things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They really do.</v>

2675
02:00:21.161 --> 02:00:23.800
<v Speaker 2>And I suspect that when we ran into </v>
<v Speaker 2>neanderthals were like,</v>

2676
02:00:23.801 --> 02:00:25.630
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's kind of interesting looking,</v>

2677
02:00:25.810 --> 02:00:27.040
<v Speaker 2>sort of hot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of different.</v>

2678
02:00:27.190 --> 02:00:28.370
<v Speaker 2>And so it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2679
02:00:28.540 --> 02:00:30.940
<v Speaker 2>first of all we know humans will </v>
<v Speaker 2>copulate with almost anything that old,</v>

2680
02:00:30.941 --> 02:00:32.010
<v Speaker 2>stale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2681
02:00:32.011 --> 02:00:35.620
<v Speaker 2>And things that aren't even alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things that aren't alive.</v>

2682
02:00:35.800 --> 02:00:36.633
<v Speaker 2>Things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the things that they probably shouldn't </v>

2683
02:00:37.961 --> 02:00:38.570
<v Speaker 2>be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>

2684
02:00:38.570 --> 02:00:41.650
<v Speaker 2>But the end athol ones are interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>because really they are cousins.</v>

2685
02:00:41.651 --> 02:00:44.110
<v Speaker 2>They're cousins separated by a million </v>
<v Speaker 2>years and some change.</v>

2686
02:00:44.510 --> 02:00:47.230
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if we don't know too much about them</v>

2687
02:00:47.231 --> 02:00:48.400
<v Speaker 2>either,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really weird,</v>

2688
02:00:48.401 --> 02:00:49.234
<v Speaker 2>we know they had larger brains than us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we don't really know how smart they </v>

2689
02:00:51.311 --> 02:00:52.240
<v Speaker 2>were now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2690
02:00:52.330 --> 02:00:54.040
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and why did we replace them?</v>

2691
02:00:54.190 --> 02:00:55.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like did we,</v>

2692
02:00:55.780 --> 02:00:57.730
<v Speaker 2>was it diseases we carry that wiped them</v>
<v Speaker 2>all out,</v>

2693
02:00:57.940 --> 02:01:00.580
<v Speaker 2>was it we were better organized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we got rid of,</v>

2694
02:01:00.680 --> 02:01:02.800
<v Speaker 2>we all competed them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We killed them on purpose,</v>

2695
02:01:02.940 --> 02:01:05.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there's a million branch species,</v>

2696
02:01:05.021 --> 02:01:05.854
<v Speaker 2>we happen to know a lot about </v>
<v Speaker 2>neanderthals because they are existed </v>

2697
02:01:07.660 --> 02:01:10.020
<v Speaker 2>until very recently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But wHat we do,</v>

2698
02:01:10.090 --> 02:01:12.310
<v Speaker 2>there's all sorts of branching that took</v>
<v Speaker 2>place early on,</v>

2699
02:01:12.311 --> 02:01:14.160
<v Speaker 2>lots of different australopithecines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>

2700
02:01:14.580 --> 02:01:15.413
<v Speaker 2>All those are dead ends and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that we're the only one that </v>

2701
02:01:18.671 --> 02:01:19.504
<v Speaker 2>comes out of that could mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well we got lucky or were me in this </v>

2702
02:01:22.301 --> 02:01:24.520
<v Speaker 2>shit and we took care of all of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>cousins who didn't,</v>

2703
02:01:24.521 --> 02:01:25.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we wanted what they had.</v>

2704
02:01:25.890 --> 02:01:27.550
<v Speaker 2>I think the ladder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2705
02:01:27.551 --> 02:01:29.650
<v Speaker 2>Probably a bit of both mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2706
02:01:29.660 --> 02:01:30.493
<v Speaker 2>I mean that doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That were mean to shit a million years </v>

2707
02:01:32.890 --> 02:01:33.330
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're mean,</v>

2708
02:01:33.330 --> 02:01:34.210
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly,</v>

2709
02:01:34.211 --> 02:01:35.920
<v Speaker 2>and what's so interesting is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2710
02:01:35.980 --> 02:01:36.813
<v Speaker 2>this is something that coming back to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the point I was making earlier about us </v>

2711
02:01:38.960 --> 02:01:40.130
<v Speaker 2>cooperating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we evolved</v>

2712
02:01:40.130 --> 02:01:40.963
<v Speaker 1>to cooperate with each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the key is we did not evolve to </v>

2713
02:01:43.311 --> 02:01:44.144
<v Speaker 1>cooperate across different groups,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so once you get to homo erectus and now </v>

2714
02:01:46.581 --> 02:01:47.414
<v Speaker 1>you've got division of labor and you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>got the capacity to plan for unfilled </v>

2715
02:01:50.781 --> 02:01:51.231
<v Speaker 1>needs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

2716
02:01:51.231 --> 02:01:53.960
<v Speaker 1>where they're carrying these issue lean </v>
<v Speaker 1>tools with them over great distances,</v>

2717
02:01:53.961 --> 02:01:54.794
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well now who's your most effective </v>

2718
02:01:56.451 --> 02:01:57.284
<v Speaker 1>predator?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The occasional mammoth or saber tooth </v>

2719
02:01:59.491 --> 02:02:01.130
<v Speaker 1>tiger will have killed the occasional </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of us,</v>

2720
02:02:01.280 --> 02:02:04.250
<v Speaker 1>but they can't possibly take us on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same way we can take them on.</v>

2721
02:02:04.520 --> 02:02:05.353
<v Speaker 1>There's only one other thing on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>planet that can take us on and that's </v>

2722
02:02:07.161 --> 02:02:07.994
<v Speaker 1>ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So other groups of homo erectus would </v>

2723
02:02:10.041 --> 02:02:10.874
<v Speaker 1>have probably been a major threat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certainly by the time we're homo </v>

2724
02:02:13.531 --> 02:02:14.364
<v Speaker 1>sapiens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other groups would have been our only </v>

2725
02:02:15.201 --> 02:02:16.034
<v Speaker 1>major threat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so we evolved to be kind to each </v>

2726
02:02:18.201 --> 02:02:21.050
<v Speaker 1>other within our group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we did not evolve to be kind outside</v>

2727
02:02:21.051 --> 02:02:21.680
<v Speaker 1>our group.</v>

2728
02:02:21.680 --> 02:02:24.320
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean we evolved to be mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We evolved to be neutral,</v>

2729
02:02:24.321 --> 02:02:27.150
<v Speaker 1>so let's see if you're going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>friend or foe and um,</v>

2730
02:02:27.151 --> 02:02:28.790
<v Speaker 1>and that neutrality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super important.</v>

2731
02:02:29.150 --> 02:02:31.850
<v Speaker 1>It has the potential for cooperation </v>
<v Speaker 1>across group boundaries.</v>

2732
02:02:31.851 --> 02:02:32.684
<v Speaker 1>We can change women and men can mingle </v>
<v Speaker 1>so we don't interbreed too much amongst </v>

2733
02:02:36.141 --> 02:02:37.940
<v Speaker 1>ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can trade with each other.</v>

2734
02:02:37.941 --> 02:02:41.030
<v Speaker 1>Lots of good things can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the second you guys get a little bit</v>

2735
02:02:41.031 --> 02:02:42.290
<v Speaker 1>aggro with us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2736
02:02:42.291 --> 02:02:46.040
<v Speaker 1>now we're in a position to just go all </v>
<v Speaker 1>out and try to exterminate you.</v>

2737
02:02:46.400 --> 02:02:48.470
<v Speaker 1>And so rang him as he's great data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Richard wrangham,</v>

2738
02:02:48.471 --> 02:02:49.304
<v Speaker 1>same catching fire guy shows that if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at the rates of violence within </v>

2739
02:02:52.821 --> 02:02:56.330
<v Speaker 1>human groups compared to chimps to like </v>
<v Speaker 1>500 times more violent,</v>

2740
02:02:56.331 --> 02:02:57.164
<v Speaker 1>physically aggressive than we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at the rates between human </v>

2741
02:02:59.450 --> 02:03:02.270
<v Speaker 1>groups equal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're the one to one ratio.</v>

2742
02:03:03.050 --> 02:03:04.700
<v Speaker 1>So we tend to think about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2743
02:03:04.701 --> 02:03:06.770
<v Speaker 1>how could it be that we're both so nice </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so mean,</v>

2744
02:03:07.040 --> 02:03:07.873
<v Speaker 1>but we have to remember that we evolved </v>
<v Speaker 1>to cooperate and to be nice to each </v>

2745
02:03:09.891 --> 02:03:11.540
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be more effective killers.</v>

2746
02:03:11.750 --> 02:03:14.480
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't because let's make a hippie </v>
<v Speaker 1>paradise.</v>

2747
02:03:14.690 --> 02:03:15.321
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>

2748
02:03:15.321 --> 02:03:16.154
<v Speaker 1>these lines are going to eat as you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to have to get together to sort </v>

2749
02:03:18.591 --> 02:03:19.424
<v Speaker 1>out these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so our cooperative nature is </v>

2750
02:03:20.961 --> 02:03:24.930
<v Speaker 1>literally the flip side of the coin of </v>
<v Speaker 1>our competitive violent killings.</v>

2751
02:03:24.980 --> 02:03:25.813
<v Speaker 3>Nature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Also the undeniable history of </v>

2752
02:03:28.240 --> 02:03:29.073
<v Speaker 3>unbelievably ruthless tribal warfare </v>
<v Speaker 3>would indicate that we have a long </v>

2753
02:03:32.441 --> 02:03:36.100
<v Speaker 3>history of fighting against others that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are like us that we don't know.</v>

2754
02:03:36.330 --> 02:03:37.163
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When when hunter gatherers meet each </v>

2755
02:03:38.611 --> 02:03:42.240
<v Speaker 1>other and they do come into conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a huge percentage of the time,</v>

2756
02:03:42.480 --> 02:03:44.940
<v Speaker 1>they literally fight to the death </v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you capture me,</v>

2757
02:03:44.941 --> 02:03:46.950
<v Speaker 1>you're going to torture me to death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I'm female,</v>

2758
02:03:46.951 --> 02:03:48.570
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Incorporate it into your system and then</v>

2759
02:03:48.571 --> 02:03:50.520
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not great,</v>

2760
02:03:50.521 --> 02:03:51.900
<v Speaker 1>but okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if I'm male,</v>

2761
02:03:51.901 --> 02:03:52.734
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to die so I might as well die </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting you now because I'm going to </v>

2762
02:03:54.661 --> 02:03:57.360
<v Speaker 1>die on pleasantly later and that's super</v>
<v Speaker 1>common.</v>

2763
02:03:57.361 --> 02:03:58.194
<v Speaker 1>That's everywhere we see it and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>tons and tons of bodies that are </v>

2764
02:04:01.560 --> 02:04:05.310
<v Speaker 1>healthily perforated that are the </v>
<v Speaker 1>clearly the consequences of this kind of</v>

2765
02:04:05.311 --> 02:04:06.010
<v Speaker 1>wharf.</v>

2766
02:04:06.010 --> 02:04:06.843
<v Speaker 3>Crazy that is thought to be even in 2018</v>
<v Speaker 3>and inevitable part of being human </v>

2767
02:04:11.861 --> 02:04:12.694
<v Speaker 3>being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean warfare even to this day is </v>

2768
02:04:15.010 --> 02:04:16.960
<v Speaker 3>thought to be inevitable because there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2769
02:04:17.320 --> 02:04:20.320
<v Speaker 3>I mean we would all love that one day </v>
<v Speaker 3>there'll be no warfare,</v>

2770
02:04:20.321 --> 02:04:22.830
<v Speaker 3>but there's no indication whatsoever </v>
<v Speaker 3>that that's taken</v>

2771
02:04:22.970 --> 02:04:23.803
<v Speaker 1>not almost there and I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think pinker has got the best answer </v>

2772
02:04:26.451 --> 02:04:28.490
<v Speaker 1>to this question which is basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2773
02:04:28.491 --> 02:04:31.400
<v Speaker 1>what structures do you need to put in </v>
<v Speaker 1>place to make the world a safer and less</v>

2774
02:04:31.401 --> 02:04:32.620
<v Speaker 1>violent place?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2775
02:04:32.621 --> 02:04:33.454
<v Speaker 1>and I don't knoW if you've talked to him</v>
<v Speaker 1>about his book better angels of our </v>

2776
02:04:35.691 --> 02:04:36.524
<v Speaker 1>nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you've talked to him about more </v>

2777
02:04:37.381 --> 02:04:37.980
<v Speaker 1>recent ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

2778
02:04:37.980 --> 02:04:40.320
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Better angels is a great example.</v>

2779
02:04:40.670 --> 02:04:41.503
<v Speaker 2>It's a great book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a great example of how we become </v>

2780
02:04:43.290 --> 02:04:45.570
<v Speaker 2>less and less violent and even over our </v>
<v Speaker 2>lifetimes.</v>

2781
02:04:45.820 --> 02:04:46.653
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and part of that is undoubtedly better </v>

2782
02:04:48.601 --> 02:04:49.434
<v Speaker 2>governance structure and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But part of that I think is cycles on </v>

2783
02:04:51.391 --> 02:04:53.340
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when I was a little kid,</v>

2784
02:04:53.341 --> 02:04:54.840
<v Speaker 2>and this kind of thing probably happened</v>
<v Speaker 2>to you,</v>

2785
02:04:55.200 --> 02:04:56.033
<v Speaker 2>I was on when I was in kindergarten,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy who drove our car pool was a </v>

2786
02:04:59.401 --> 02:05:00.234
<v Speaker 2>cop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this cop is driving me home in the </v>

2787
02:05:01.951 --> 02:05:02.784
<v Speaker 2>back of his car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now he's got no seat belts because this </v>

2788
02:05:04.591 --> 02:05:06.720
<v Speaker 2>is 1969 and cars don't have seat belts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2789
02:05:06.721 --> 02:05:07.554
<v Speaker 2>Big bench seat and a buick or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we'd come around a corner and they </v>

2790
02:05:10.321 --> 02:05:11.154
<v Speaker 2>all slide up against me to the edge of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the car seat and I'm trying to push </v>

2791
02:05:13.441 --> 02:05:14.400
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm this little guy,</v>

2792
02:05:14.401 --> 02:05:14.820
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2793
02:05:14.820 --> 02:05:16.110
<v Speaker 2>And I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I hit the,</v>

2794
02:05:16.111 --> 02:05:17.880
<v Speaker 2>I mUst have hit my elbow against the </v>
<v Speaker 2>door,</v>

2795
02:05:17.980 --> 02:05:19.350
<v Speaker 2>flies open.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I rolled out of the car.</v>

2796
02:05:19.480 --> 02:05:21.540
<v Speaker 2>Oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I go bouncing across the street.</v>

2797
02:05:21.541 --> 02:05:22.570
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's,</v>

2798
02:05:22.571 --> 02:05:23.404
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not going to arrive home empty </v>

2799
02:05:23.941 --> 02:05:24.774
<v Speaker 2>handed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So of course he goes and retrieves me </v>

2800
02:05:25.411 --> 02:05:26.244
<v Speaker 2>from the ditch and he brings me home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shows my mum and I'm bleeding and </v>

2801
02:05:28.921 --> 02:05:32.250
<v Speaker 2>bruised and torn shIrt and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you'd expect from bouncing out of a</v>

2802
02:05:32.251 --> 02:05:34.560
<v Speaker 2>car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my mom who's a pediatrician.</v>

2803
02:05:34.561 --> 02:05:36.270
<v Speaker 2>So she could tell I wasn't badly </v>
<v Speaker 2>damaged.</v>

2804
02:05:36.300 --> 02:05:37.160
<v Speaker 2>It looks to me over and says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hi,</v>

2805
02:05:37.170 --> 02:05:38.160
<v Speaker 2>he looks fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't worry about it.</v>

2806
02:05:38.850 --> 02:05:39.683
<v Speaker 2>Can you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you imagine somebody brought your </v>

2807
02:05:40.501 --> 02:05:41.490
<v Speaker 2>kid home?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Said,</v>

2808
02:05:41.491 --> 02:05:42.720
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really sorry joe.</v>

2809
02:05:42.870 --> 02:05:43.703
<v Speaker 2>Your daughter fell out the car and </v>
<v Speaker 2>bounced across the street to a throttle </v>

2810
02:05:46.231 --> 02:05:47.064
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'd be freak out and that's not that </v>

2811
02:05:48.511 --> 02:05:49.540
<v Speaker 2>long ago either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2812
02:05:49.620 --> 02:05:50.453
<v Speaker 2>this is 1969 when you and I are both on </v>
<v Speaker 2>this planet and so what I think is part </v>

2813
02:05:53.731 --> 02:05:56.790
<v Speaker 2>of what's what pinker's documenting is </v>
<v Speaker 2>as the world gets safer,</v>

2814
02:05:57.210 --> 02:06:00.900
<v Speaker 2>we start getting used to a low mayhem </v>
<v Speaker 2>world and these,</v>

2815
02:06:01.230 --> 02:06:02.063
<v Speaker 2>these mayhem event stand out in our </v>
<v Speaker 2>minds and so it actually self </v>

2816
02:06:04.621 --> 02:06:05.454
<v Speaker 2>perpetuates where the safer it gets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the safer we needed to be because every </v>

2817
02:06:08.221 --> 02:06:10.680
<v Speaker 2>little thing that goes wrong stands out </v>
<v Speaker 2>in sharper relief.</v>

2818
02:06:11.940 --> 02:06:12.773
<v Speaker 3>Very fascinating way Of looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what's interesting to me about </v>

2819
02:06:16.680 --> 02:06:17.513
<v Speaker 3>pinker's work is how much pushback he </v>
<v Speaker 3>gets and particularly about the world </v>

2820
02:06:20.611 --> 02:06:21.444
<v Speaker 3>being a safer place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like people want to keep putting </v>

2821
02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:24.833
<v Speaker 3>pointing towards violent episodes and </v>
<v Speaker 3>and racism and crime and all these </v>

2822
02:06:30.571 --> 02:06:31.404
<v Speaker 3>different things is different factors as</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it's some sort of evidence against </v>

2823
02:06:34.441 --> 02:06:36.540
<v Speaker 3>what he's saying when he's incorporating</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2824
02:06:36.570 --> 02:06:41.160
<v Speaker 3>those Current events into this large </v>
<v Speaker 3>database.</v>

2825
02:06:41.310 --> 02:06:44.910
<v Speaker 3>And he's saying yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not that we don't live in utopia,</v>

2826
02:06:45.240 --> 02:06:46.073
<v Speaker 3>but the woRld is vastly safer and better</v>
<v Speaker 3>now than it was a thousand years ago or </v>

2827
02:06:49.681 --> 02:06:50.514
<v Speaker 3>10,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago or even 100 years ago or even </v>

2828
02:06:51.711 --> 02:06:53.790
<v Speaker 3>if there's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is there so much pushback</v>

2829
02:06:53.850 --> 02:06:55.090
<v Speaker 2>against this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the thing is,</v>

2830
02:06:55.130 --> 02:06:55.963
<v Speaker 2>I think what's going on as that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>worry that it doesn't look like a </v>

2831
02:06:58.121 --> 02:07:00.030
<v Speaker 2>problem to be solved anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2832
02:07:00.031 --> 02:07:01.480
<v Speaker 2>So when you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When our kids,</v>

2833
02:07:01.720 --> 02:07:02.553
<v Speaker 2>we both have lots of gay friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we didn't know it because they're </v>

2834
02:07:04.211 --> 02:07:05.044
<v Speaker 2>not telling anybody because someone's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to kick their ass if they knew </v>

2835
02:07:06.851 --> 02:07:08.440
<v Speaker 2>that they were gay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

2836
02:07:08.441 --> 02:07:09.274
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gay people are still discriminated </v>

2837
02:07:09.941 --> 02:07:10.774
<v Speaker 2>against,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's so much better than it was </v>

2838
02:07:11.651 --> 02:07:12.970
<v Speaker 2>then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you don't want to.</v>

2839
02:07:13.100 --> 02:07:15.010
<v Speaker 2>What I think people are advocates don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to say as well,</v>

2840
02:07:15.011 --> 02:07:15.844
<v Speaker 2>there's no problem anymore because then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can allow them to still run into </v>

2841
02:07:19.061 --> 02:07:19.894
<v Speaker 2>troubles in various circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even though the trouble they run into </v>

2842
02:07:21.671 --> 02:07:22.504
<v Speaker 2>today is a thousand times less than the </v>
<v Speaker 2>trouble they ran into and read little </v>

2843
02:07:25.510 --> 02:07:28.200
<v Speaker 2>same thing holds for racism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same thing holds for sexism.</v>

2844
02:07:28.240 --> 02:07:29.073
<v Speaker 2>They've all gotten so much better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but and sexual violence is a perfect </v>

2845
02:07:32.771 --> 02:07:33.290
<v Speaker 2>example.</v>

2846
02:07:33.290 --> 02:07:34.690
<v Speaker 2>You know if you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you set,</v>

2847
02:07:34.740 --> 02:07:38.920
<v Speaker 2>this is in pinker's book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you set rape and homicide to you call</v>

2848
02:07:38.921 --> 02:07:39.754
<v Speaker 2>it both of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever level they are in 1970 to 100 </v>

2849
02:07:41.710 --> 02:07:42.543
<v Speaker 2>and then you track them through to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>early two thousands on homicide is in </v>

2850
02:07:45.731 --> 02:07:46.564
<v Speaker 2>the uS.</v>
<v Speaker 2>homicides dropped down to like 50 rapes </v>

2851
02:07:48.370 --> 02:07:49.203
<v Speaker 2>dropped down to like 25,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you listen to women's advocacy </v>

2852
02:07:52.031 --> 02:07:54.040
<v Speaker 2>groups about campus sexual assault and </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>

2853
02:07:54.041 --> 02:07:54.874
<v Speaker 2>you'd never know that and the reason you</v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't know it is because people </v>

2854
02:07:57.941 --> 02:07:58.774
<v Speaker 2>worry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2855
02:07:58.870 --> 02:08:00.850
<v Speaker 2>if you think the problem's getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>better on its own,</v>

2856
02:08:00.851 --> 02:08:03.100
<v Speaker 2>then you won't keep doing anything to </v>
<v Speaker 2>help fix it.</v>

2857
02:08:03.460 --> 02:08:04.293
<v Speaker 2>And that's a really unfortunate part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>our psychology because it makes people </v>

2858
02:08:06.791 --> 02:08:09.730
<v Speaker 2>feel like there's been no progress and </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you feel like there's no progress,</v>

2859
02:08:09.731 --> 02:08:10.564
<v Speaker 2>then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well maybe we need to completely </v>

2860
02:08:11.321 --> 02:08:13.210
<v Speaker 2>overturn the whole system and try </v>
<v Speaker 2>something new.</v>

2861
02:08:13.390 --> 02:08:15.520
<v Speaker 2>And that's of course the point of </v>
<v Speaker 2>pinker's newest book,</v>

2862
02:08:15.521 --> 02:08:18.040
<v Speaker 2>enlightenment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now no things are going fricking great.</v>

2863
02:08:18.330 --> 02:08:20.980
<v Speaker 2>Turning anarchy and all of those things </v>
<v Speaker 2>are really bad ideas.</v>

2864
02:08:20.981 --> 02:08:21.814
<v Speaker 2>Voting for somebody like trump's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>really bad idea because things are </v>

2865
02:08:23.681 --> 02:08:24.514
<v Speaker 2>actually running along really nicely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just that we tend to forget it </v>

2866
02:08:27.131 --> 02:08:27.964
<v Speaker 2>because every advocacy group who's all </v>
<v Speaker 2>worried about whatever their particular </v>

2867
02:08:30.701 --> 02:08:31.534
<v Speaker 2>issue is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't want the word to get out that </v>

2868
02:08:33.341 --> 02:08:34.630
<v Speaker 2>things are a lot better than they used </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be.</v>

2869
02:08:34.631 --> 02:08:36.370
<v Speaker 2>Because I think at some fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 2>level they think,</v>

2870
02:08:36.371 --> 02:08:38.890
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>25 grapes here isn't bad enough.</v>

2871
02:08:38.891 --> 02:08:40.520
<v Speaker 2>We better say that there's 100 or you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

2872
02:08:40.540 --> 02:08:43.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying they do this consciously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but of course 25 reps here,</v>

2873
02:08:43.511 --> 02:08:45.310
<v Speaker 2>whatever the number is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is bad enough.</v>

2874
02:08:45.311 --> 02:08:46.150
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doEsn't.</v>

2875
02:08:46.450 --> 02:08:49.690
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have to be the numbers that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it used to be when I was a child to be a</v>

2876
02:08:49.691 --> 02:08:50.380
<v Speaker 2>problem at all.</v>

2877
02:08:50.380 --> 02:08:52.840
<v Speaker 2>That has to be as a number above zero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2878
02:08:52.900 --> 02:08:53.733
<v Speaker 2>there seems to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The people develop this vested interest </v>

2879
02:08:56.621 --> 02:09:00.640
<v Speaker 2>in promoting an idea and they want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>exaggerate that idea.</v>

2880
02:09:00.641 --> 02:09:01.474
<v Speaker 2>Whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's the idea that the world is </v>

2881
02:09:02.741 --> 02:09:03.574
<v Speaker 2>a safer place than it actually is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or whether it's the world as an idea of </v>

2882
02:09:06.340 --> 02:09:07.173
<v Speaker 2>a more dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more dangerous place and it really is </v>

2883
02:09:09.100 --> 02:09:13.090
<v Speaker 2>and for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once we have it in our mind that this is</v>

2884
02:09:13.150 --> 02:09:13.983
<v Speaker 2>the thing we're married.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two were married to this concept of </v>

2885
02:09:16.420 --> 02:09:20.130
<v Speaker 2>polyamorous life and that this is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>natural way to live or that you know,</v>

2886
02:09:20.270 --> 02:09:22.720
<v Speaker 2>violence is inevitable and then this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>just a part of who we are.</v>

2887
02:09:22.870 --> 02:09:27.190
<v Speaker 2>We tend to promote that and we tend to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have massive confirmation bias and it's,</v>

2888
02:09:27.760 --> 02:09:28.593
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's because we personally </v>

2889
02:09:31.631 --> 02:09:35.320
<v Speaker 2>associate ourselves with ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't look at ideas as being a thing.</v>

2890
02:09:35.590 --> 02:09:36.423
<v Speaker 2>Like if you think that something is one </v>
<v Speaker 2>way and then you're pointed towards </v>

2891
02:09:40.511 --> 02:09:41.344
<v Speaker 2>evidence that you're incorrect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you feel like personally you've been </v>

2892
02:09:44.351 --> 02:09:47.500
<v Speaker 2>slighted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or your being somehow,</v>

2893
02:09:47.530 --> 02:09:50.470
<v Speaker 2>somehow you're being diminished by your </v>
<v Speaker 2>lack of being.</v>

2894
02:09:50.471 --> 02:09:51.304
<v Speaker 2>Correct,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're incorrect assumptions and </v>

2895
02:09:52.411 --> 02:09:54.010
<v Speaker 2>notions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're absolutely right.</v>

2896
02:09:54.040 --> 02:09:54.873
<v Speaker 2>That is a weird part of being a person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very weird part of it being a </v>

2897
02:09:57.611 --> 02:09:58.444
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the hardest part about being a </v>

2898
02:09:59.261 --> 02:10:01.960
<v Speaker 2>scientist because every good scientist </v>
<v Speaker 2>is wrong all the time.</v>

2899
02:10:02.380 --> 02:10:04.000
<v Speaker 2>I've been wrong already on your show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2900
02:10:04.120 --> 02:10:07.240
<v Speaker 2>And so it's super hard to admit it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because by human nature you just want.</v>

2901
02:10:07.241 --> 02:10:08.074
<v Speaker 2>You want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My immediate reaction is to fight </v>

2902
02:10:09.221 --> 02:10:10.480
<v Speaker 2>against it and not say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2903
02:10:10.481 --> 02:10:11.660
<v Speaker 2>hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's joe saying?</v>

2904
02:10:11.830 --> 02:10:12.400
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's right.</v>

2905
02:10:12.400 --> 02:10:13.990
<v Speaker 2>I overstated that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's back off.</v>

2906
02:10:13.991 --> 02:10:14.824
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there's this really lovely paper </v>

2907
02:10:16.331 --> 02:10:19.030
<v Speaker 2>that came out in 2011 by mercier and dan</v>
<v Speaker 2>sperber,</v>

2908
02:10:19.270 --> 02:10:22.150
<v Speaker 2>and what they argued is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they nailed it and they said,</v>

2909
02:10:22.151 --> 02:10:22.984
<v Speaker 2>here's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our Brain actually evolved our logical </v>

2910
02:10:25.721 --> 02:10:28.540
<v Speaker 2>processing abilities not to find out the</v>
<v Speaker 2>truth of the world,</v>

2911
02:10:28.720 --> 02:10:29.553
<v Speaker 2>but to convince you of my point of view.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so with oUr logical abilities </v>

2912
02:10:33.531 --> 02:10:34.010
<v Speaker 2>evolved in</v>

2913
02:10:34.010 --> 02:10:36.950
<v Speaker 4>service of persuasion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not in service of seeking out the truth,</v>

2914
02:10:37.280 --> 02:10:38.113
<v Speaker 4>because of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I can persuade you that the world is </v>

2915
02:10:40.041 --> 02:10:42.830
<v Speaker 4>the way it would in a way that benefits </v>
<v Speaker 4>bill,</v>

2916
02:10:43.140 --> 02:10:47.480
<v Speaker 4>that the world is something about the </v>
<v Speaker 4>way bill wants the world to be is true,</v>

2917
02:10:47.690 --> 02:10:49.550
<v Speaker 4>then the world's going to be a little </v>
<v Speaker 4>kinder to me.</v>

2918
02:10:49.551 --> 02:10:52.280
<v Speaker 4>It'll fit my worldview and others will </v>
<v Speaker 4>give me the things I want.</v>

2919
02:10:52.460 --> 02:10:55.580
<v Speaker 4>And so I go through life trying to </v>
<v Speaker 4>persuade you of my worldview rather than</v>

2920
02:10:55.581 --> 02:10:57.440
<v Speaker 4>trying to find out what's actually out </v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

2921
02:10:57.710 --> 02:10:58.543
<v Speaker 4>And so that's why you think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh well smart people are going to fall </v>

2922
02:11:00.171 --> 02:11:01.160
<v Speaker 4>for that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No smart.</v>

2923
02:11:01.250 --> 02:11:02.940
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't matter how smart you are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

2924
02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:04.730
<v Speaker 4>you're using whatever brain power you </v>
<v Speaker 4>have.</v>

2925
02:11:04.760 --> 02:11:05.593
<v Speaker 4>Not defined the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but rather to find evidence for your </v>

2926
02:11:07.641 --> 02:11:09.340
<v Speaker 4>particular point of view.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2927
02:11:09.350 --> 02:11:10.183
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's also a byproduct of </v>

2928
02:11:11.241 --> 02:11:12.074
<v Speaker 4>ignorance because for the longest time </v>
<v Speaker 4>you could tell me something and there </v>

2929
02:11:14.871 --> 02:11:17.570
<v Speaker 4>was very little way that I could find </v>
<v Speaker 4>out whether or not your writer,</v>

2930
02:11:18.490 --> 02:11:19.370
<v Speaker 4>I really couldn't.</v>

2931
02:11:19.370 --> 02:11:20.450
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're correct.</v>

2932
02:11:20.451 --> 02:11:21.284
<v Speaker 4>Unless I went and started doing research</v>
<v Speaker 4>and read some books and whereas now I </v>

2933
02:11:24.471 --> 02:11:27.350
<v Speaker 4>could just pull up my phone and say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

2934
02:11:27.351 --> 02:11:29.180
<v Speaker 4>bill just said this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that right?</v>

2935
02:11:29.360 --> 02:11:30.440
<v Speaker 4>And then the phone wIll go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2936
02:11:30.441 --> 02:11:32.030
<v Speaker 4>there's been 100 different studies that </v>
<v Speaker 4>show that,</v>

2937
02:11:32.031 --> 02:11:33.080
<v Speaker 4>and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh look,</v>

2938
02:11:33.090 --> 02:11:34.820
<v Speaker 4>motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got the stats.</v>

2939
02:11:35.870 --> 02:11:38.390
<v Speaker 4>That's true,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that definitely matters a lot.</v>

2940
02:11:38.400 --> 02:11:41.120
<v Speaker 4>It's this awesome democratization of </v>
<v Speaker 4>knowledge,</v>

2941
02:11:41.540 --> 02:11:42.373
<v Speaker 4>but if that really were all that it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then everybody would agree on their </v>

2942
02:11:45.711 --> 02:11:47.750
<v Speaker 4>politics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody would agree that the fake news</v>

2943
02:11:47.751 --> 02:11:51.050
<v Speaker 4>was fake and the real news was real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not necessarily because this is a fairly</v>

2944
02:11:51.051 --> 02:11:51.884
<v Speaker 4>recent invention,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what I'm getting at is that I think </v>

2945
02:11:53.511 --> 02:11:54.344
<v Speaker 4>that the ability to be deceptive was </v>
<v Speaker 4>perhaps there was an evolutionary </v>

2946
02:11:58.311 --> 02:11:59.270
<v Speaker 4>advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2947
02:11:59.271 --> 02:12:00.020
<v Speaker 4>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2948
02:12:00.020 --> 02:12:00.853
<v Speaker 4>so that's one of the very first thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>that happens when you have theory of </v>

2949
02:12:02.601 --> 02:12:03.434
<v Speaker 4>mind,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because as soon as I realized the </v>

2950
02:12:04.461 --> 02:12:06.860
<v Speaker 4>contents of your mind differ from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>contents of my own,</v>

2951
02:12:07.100 --> 02:12:07.933
<v Speaker 4>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2952
02:12:08.060 --> 02:12:10.550
<v Speaker 4>I can plant something in joe's mind </v>
<v Speaker 4>that'll help me.</v>

2953
02:12:10.550 --> 02:12:12.350
<v Speaker 4>That ain't true,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if he believes it is,</v>

2954
02:12:12.351 --> 02:12:13.184
<v Speaker 4>life will be better for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so as soon as kids learn theory of </v>

2955
02:12:15.651 --> 02:12:16.461
<v Speaker 4>mind,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at age four,</v>

2956
02:12:16.461 --> 02:12:18.590
<v Speaker 4>they start to lie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And prior to theory of mind,</v>

2957
02:12:18.591 --> 02:12:21.170
<v Speaker 4>they tell the truth when it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where are you playing?</v>

2958
02:12:21.180 --> 02:12:21.960
<v Speaker 4>Hide and seek.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm right here,</v>

2959
02:12:21.960 --> 02:12:24.410
<v Speaker 4>dad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're supposed to keep quiet.</v>

2960
02:12:24.440 --> 02:12:25.273
<v Speaker 4>But they can't because they don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>understand that you don't know the same </v>

2961
02:12:26.961 --> 02:12:27.560
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They know,</v>

2962
02:12:27.560 --> 02:12:28.640
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2963
02:12:28.641 --> 02:12:29.474
<v Speaker 4>And they also understand that they could</v>
<v Speaker 4>perhaps change the way you feel about </v>

2964
02:12:32.601 --> 02:12:35.180
<v Speaker 4>them by manipulating the truth relating </v>
<v Speaker 4>information.</v>

2965
02:12:35.530 --> 02:12:40.530
<v Speaker 4>It's what's weird is having kids and </v>
<v Speaker 4>seeing kids grow up and troubled homes.</v>

2966
02:12:41.690 --> 02:12:44.140
<v Speaker 4>One,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one thing you see almost universally is,</v>

2967
02:12:44.141 --> 02:12:46.210
<v Speaker 4>are those kids lie a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2968
02:12:46.820 --> 02:12:48.110
<v Speaker 4>because you're in the no choice </v>
<v Speaker 4>condition,</v>

2969
02:12:48.111 --> 02:12:48.531
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2970
02:12:48.531 --> 02:12:49.364
<v Speaker 4>You're in a bad spot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And like one of my daughter's little </v>

2971
02:12:51.381 --> 02:12:54.490
<v Speaker 4>friends is constantly lying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

2972
02:12:54.530 --> 02:12:58.880
<v Speaker 4>she has a broken home and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>situation's not good and it's just,</v>

2973
02:12:59.300 --> 02:13:02.990
<v Speaker 4>it's unfortunate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But this little kid is tormented because</v>

2974
02:13:02.991 --> 02:13:05.900
<v Speaker 4>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's always making stuff up and all the</v>

2975
02:13:05.901 --> 02:13:08.720
<v Speaker 4>other little girls roll their eyes and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they know she's a liar and it's.</v>

2976
02:13:08.721 --> 02:13:11.090
<v Speaker 4>IT's sad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the ability to be deceptive,</v>

2977
02:13:11.630 --> 02:13:14.000
<v Speaker 4>I feel like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know this,</v>

2978
02:13:14.470 --> 02:13:19.470
<v Speaker 4>there's some sort of idea that we cling </v>
<v Speaker 4>to that if you can deceive someone about</v>

2979
02:13:20.661 --> 02:13:23.750
<v Speaker 4>certain particular aspects of your mind </v>
<v Speaker 4>or your past or what you've,</v>

2980
02:13:24.020 --> 02:13:27.200
<v Speaker 4>what you've accomplished or what you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>capable of doing,</v>

2981
02:13:27.590 --> 02:13:30.950
<v Speaker 4>that you will have a better place in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>social chain.</v>

2982
02:13:31.450 --> 02:13:32.220
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's absolutely</v>

2983
02:13:32.220 --> 02:13:34.230
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the way I think about it is think</v>

2984
02:13:34.231 --> 02:13:37.020
<v Speaker 1>about the difference between conspecific</v>
<v Speaker 1>conflicts,</v>

2985
02:13:37.021 --> 02:13:37.854
<v Speaker 1>conflicts between members of the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>species and conflicts between predator </v>

2986
02:13:40.411 --> 02:13:41.244
<v Speaker 1>and prey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So every time predator and prey </v>

2987
02:13:42.811 --> 02:13:45.180
<v Speaker 1>interact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually one of them's going to die.</v>

2988
02:13:45.410 --> 02:13:47.460
<v Speaker 1>Your editor's going to starve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>praise going to get eaten,</v>

2989
02:13:47.461 --> 02:13:48.294
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when conspecifics members of the </v>

2990
02:13:49.651 --> 02:13:51.960
<v Speaker 1>same species interact more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>competing over something,</v>

2991
02:13:51.961 --> 02:13:53.940
<v Speaker 1>even if it's a very subtle level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>competition,</v>

2992
02:13:54.300 --> 02:13:57.520
<v Speaker 1>we don't want to come to blows because </v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm trying to size you up,</v>

2993
02:13:57.521 --> 02:14:01.380
<v Speaker 1>be it physical blows or mental blows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We suffering on both sides.</v>

2994
02:14:01.381 --> 02:14:02.214
<v Speaker 1>If we have to do get out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I want to sell myself as being a </v>

2995
02:14:04.771 --> 02:14:07.830
<v Speaker 1>little more than I really am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to be bill plus 20 percent.</v>

2996
02:14:08.190 --> 02:14:10.350
<v Speaker 1>And you want to say yourself as a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than you really are,</v>

2997
02:14:10.351 --> 02:14:13.410
<v Speaker 1>because we know that we're not fully </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to test each other because there's</v>

2998
02:14:13.411 --> 02:14:17.070
<v Speaker 1>negative consequences for testing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever this negative consequences,</v>

2999
02:14:17.071 --> 02:14:17.904
<v Speaker 1>even for the winter for testing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of posturing that's going </v>

3000
02:14:20.061 --> 02:14:20.894
<v Speaker 1>to go on and that posturing is something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's literally built into our psyche </v>

3001
02:14:23.940 --> 02:14:26.460
<v Speaker 1>and we go through life trying to sell </v>
<v Speaker 1>from flight on average.</v>

3002
02:14:26.460 --> 02:14:30.270
<v Speaker 1>Not already does this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but on average trying to sell as much as</v>

3003
02:14:30.270 --> 02:14:31.103
<v Speaker 1>we can in order to gain the things in </v>
<v Speaker 1>life that we might not get if we're </v>

3004
02:14:33.511 --> 02:14:35.990
<v Speaker 1>brutally honest about what our </v>
<v Speaker 1>capabilities actually are.</v>

3005
02:14:36.610 --> 02:14:37.443
<v Speaker 3>Fascinating that we cling to all of </v>
<v Speaker 3>these ancient structures that are in </v>

3006
02:14:40.691 --> 02:14:41.524
<v Speaker 3>place when it comes to the way we </v>
<v Speaker 3>interact with each other and how </v>

3007
02:14:44.201 --> 02:14:45.034
<v Speaker 3>important is the social exchanges that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we have and that I think this is one of </v>

3008
02:14:48.761 --> 02:14:52.170
<v Speaker 3>the reasons why we cling to ideas so </v>
<v Speaker 3>much that these ideas,</v>

3009
02:14:52.420 --> 02:14:55.840
<v Speaker 3>if you can push an idea through,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got some sort of points</v>

3010
02:14:56.010 --> 02:14:56.840
<v Speaker 1>board.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

3011
02:14:56.840 --> 02:14:57.673
<v Speaker 1>Got points on the board and probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>your ideas on average are going to </v>

3012
02:15:00.091 --> 02:15:04.080
<v Speaker 1>benefit you and my days on average </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefit me and so if I'm,</v>

3013
02:15:04.290 --> 02:15:05.123
<v Speaker 1>if I'm happily married in a monogamous </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship and I'm not looking around </v>

3014
02:15:07.981 --> 02:15:11.040
<v Speaker 1>within monogamy's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the great thing and sleeping around is a</v>

3015
02:15:11.041 --> 02:15:12.240
<v Speaker 1>sin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if I'm,</v>

3016
02:15:12.630 --> 02:15:14.460
<v Speaker 1>if I'm single and I've got </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunities,</v>

3017
02:15:14.580 --> 02:15:16.520
<v Speaker 1>well then I probably hold alternative </v>
<v Speaker 1>views.</v>

3018
02:15:16.521 --> 02:15:17.354
<v Speaker 1>So on average our views not perfectly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but on average our views serve as well </v>

3019
02:15:20.520 --> 02:15:23.190
<v Speaker 1>and if I can plant my views in your mind</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've benefited.</v>

3020
02:15:23.520 --> 02:15:25.440
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw that a lot.</v>

3021
02:15:25.640 --> 02:15:28.050
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you see that a lot with everything,</v>

3022
02:15:28.380 --> 02:15:29.213
<v Speaker 3>but I guess more what we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about people that don't want to admit </v>

3023
02:15:33.691 --> 02:15:34.524
<v Speaker 3>like what about when it comes to like </v>
<v Speaker 3>pinker's data about the world being a </v>

3024
02:15:37.621 --> 02:15:38.454
<v Speaker 3>better place because they have almost a </v>
<v Speaker 3>vested interest in stirring up fear and </v>

3025
02:15:41.550 --> 02:15:46.140
<v Speaker 3>that they're committed in their mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're committed to constantly studying</v>

3026
02:15:46.520 --> 02:15:47.353
<v Speaker 3>the wrongs of the world and the evil of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world and that any sort of </v>

3027
02:15:50.491 --> 02:15:51.324
<v Speaker 3>diminishing of that is actually going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause harm to the people that are </v>

3028
02:15:54.901 --> 02:15:55.734
<v Speaker 3>suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think they have a good perk in </v>

3029
02:15:58.291 --> 02:16:00.150
<v Speaker 3>their mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's good intention,</v>

3030
02:16:00.350 --> 02:16:01.183
<v Speaker 1>I totally agree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the data are consistent with their </v>

3031
02:16:02.691 --> 02:16:03.524
<v Speaker 1>strategies because on average fear </v>
<v Speaker 1>appeals and anger appeals work a whole </v>

3032
02:16:06.861 --> 02:16:07.641
<v Speaker 1>lot better than,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

3033
02:16:07.641 --> 02:16:09.740
<v Speaker 1>things are great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Donate to this cause and we'll keep them</v>

3034
02:16:09.741 --> 02:16:10.600
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't work at all.</v>

3035
02:16:10.630 --> 02:16:12.830
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't work at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when,</v>

3036
02:16:12.831 --> 02:16:13.664
<v Speaker 1>when viagra was invented in 1989,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my little brother and I were chatting </v>

3037
02:16:17.571 --> 02:16:18.620
<v Speaker 1>about it and we thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know this,</v>

3038
02:16:18.621 --> 02:16:19.454
<v Speaker 1>I'll save some animals because there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of animals that are consumed for </v>

3039
02:16:21.771 --> 02:16:22.604
<v Speaker 1>their presumed potency affects by like </v>
<v Speaker 1>traditional chinese medicine consumers </v>

3040
02:16:26.151 --> 02:16:27.830
<v Speaker 1>and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we thought,</v>

3041
02:16:27.831 --> 02:16:30.230
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I ever actually works prior to viagra</v>

3042
02:16:30.231 --> 02:16:32.980
<v Speaker 1>and nothing is out there that works up </v>
<v Speaker 1>at this 11 impact.</v>

3043
02:16:32.981 --> 02:16:36.070
<v Speaker 1>And so we wrote this little letter off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>send it to a journal and said,</v>

3044
02:16:36.310 --> 02:16:39.130
<v Speaker 1>you know that this is going to save </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain animals like seals,</v>

3045
02:16:39.131 --> 02:16:41.320
<v Speaker 1>which they could be harvested to eat </v>
<v Speaker 1>their penises.</v>

3046
02:16:41.470 --> 02:16:43.360
<v Speaker 1>Canadian seals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know a minute what?</v>

3047
02:16:43.420 --> 02:16:46.360
<v Speaker 1>I know people that you're allowed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>kill a certain number.</v>

3048
02:16:46.400 --> 02:16:48.250
<v Speaker 1>You can't kill the seals in America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're protected,</v>

3049
02:16:48.251 --> 02:16:49.360
<v Speaker 1>but in Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>us,</v>

3050
02:16:49.361 --> 02:16:51.640
<v Speaker 1>but in Canada you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a hood seal,</v>

3051
02:16:51.641 --> 02:16:54.430
<v Speaker 1>eliminate allow men and a harp seal </v>
<v Speaker 1>allotment,</v>

3052
02:16:54.730 --> 02:16:57.220
<v Speaker 1>and so people were killing up to their </v>
<v Speaker 1>allotments and selling.</v>

3053
02:16:57.221 --> 02:16:58.054
<v Speaker 1>You could do it solely for the penis and</v>
<v Speaker 1>sell the penis for enough money to make </v>

3054
02:17:00.431 --> 02:17:01.750
<v Speaker 1>your money back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

3055
02:17:01.751 --> 02:17:04.050
<v Speaker 1>what purpose does the seals penis have </v>
<v Speaker 1>beyond the seals?</v>

3056
02:17:04.210 --> 02:17:05.500
<v Speaker 1>Original purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zilch.</v>

3057
02:17:05.501 --> 02:17:07.570
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they eat it because it's supposed to</v>

3058
02:17:07.571 --> 02:17:08.404
<v Speaker 1>make you more potent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>satisfied as a rhino horn rhino horn as </v>

3059
02:17:11.031 --> 02:17:12.880
<v Speaker 1>an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's used for lots of different things</v>

3060
02:17:12.881 --> 02:17:16.330
<v Speaker 1>so it's less likely to be helped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the seal penis is only,</v>

3061
02:17:16.331 --> 02:17:17.164
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people basically only using it for its </v>

3062
02:17:18.161 --> 02:17:19.810
<v Speaker 1>potency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when fire comes along,</v>

3063
02:17:19.811 --> 02:17:22.080
<v Speaker 1>like literally you're shopping in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>supermarket where you could have by,</v>

3064
02:17:22.090 --> 02:17:22.923
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll have some ceo peanuts or I'll take </v>

3065
02:17:24.371 --> 02:17:25.300
<v Speaker 1>a viagra.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3066
02:17:25.301 --> 02:17:27.670
<v Speaker 1>we just said people are going to switch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were greeDy.</v>

3067
02:17:27.671 --> 02:17:29.770
<v Speaker 1>You throw both of them to try them both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And.</v>

3068
02:17:29.771 --> 02:17:31.380
<v Speaker 1>And people did actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

3069
02:17:31.500 --> 02:17:32.333
<v Speaker 1>but we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we made this argument and we literally </v>

3070
02:17:33.491 --> 02:17:34.324
<v Speaker 1>were attacked by the world wildlife fund</v>
<v Speaker 1>government looking at plan to revive </v>

3071
02:17:37.511 --> 02:17:42.511
<v Speaker 1>seal peanuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What hold the fuck on is this recent?</v>

3072
02:17:43.290 --> 02:17:46.330
<v Speaker 1>It was updated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was published in 2015,</v>

3073
02:17:46.331 --> 02:17:47.560
<v Speaker 1>but it was updated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This may</v>

3074
02:17:47.990 --> 02:17:50.870
<v Speaker 3>what the government is looking at a </v>
<v Speaker 3>plan,</v>

3075
02:17:50.930 --> 02:17:55.930
<v Speaker 3>go back up to revive seal penis sales.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3076
02:17:56.960 --> 02:18:00.230
<v Speaker 3>This must be a plan was brought to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>government.</v>

3077
02:18:00.231 --> 02:18:01.064
<v Speaker 3>This must not be the worst way of like </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at that headline is that the </v>

3078
02:18:04.071 --> 02:18:05.120
<v Speaker 3>government's thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

3079
02:18:05.300 --> 02:18:07.460
<v Speaker 3>we got to fucking revive these penis </v>
<v Speaker 3>sales.</v>

3080
02:18:07.610 --> 02:18:08.443
<v Speaker 3>No one's buying.</v>

3081
02:18:09.020 --> 02:18:09.853
<v Speaker 1>Because they actually may be thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>that because you got some relatively </v>

3082
02:18:12.001 --> 02:18:14.580
<v Speaker 1>impoverished people are hunting for them</v>
<v Speaker 1>and no one's buying them anymore.</v>

3083
02:18:15.050 --> 02:18:16.410
<v Speaker 1>So if you're not going to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3084
02:18:16.420 --> 02:18:20.880
<v Speaker 1>if you're not going to reveal the report</v>
<v Speaker 1>drafted by the for institute.</v>

3085
02:18:20.910 --> 02:18:21.743
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there you go.</v>

3086
02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:22.833
<v Speaker 3>Aimed at creating new markets to support</v>
<v Speaker 3>an earlier proposal to kill a hundred </v>

3087
02:18:27.071 --> 02:18:27.904
<v Speaker 3>and 40,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>gray seals over five years in the </v>

3088
02:18:30.041 --> 02:18:30.874
<v Speaker 3>southern gulf of st laurence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seventy percent of gray seals that </v>

3089
02:18:35.561 --> 02:18:38.950
<v Speaker 3>frequent the area so that what they want</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do is they want to diminish the.</v>

3090
02:18:39.010 --> 02:18:40.060
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's what it is.</v>

3091
02:18:40.390 --> 02:18:41.223
<v Speaker 3>They have long complained that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>growing population of gray seals is to </v>

3092
02:18:43.241 --> 02:18:46.180
<v Speaker 3>blame for eating too many commercially </v>
<v Speaker 3>viable fish,</v>

3093
02:18:46.300 --> 02:18:48.940
<v Speaker 3>which has resulted in repeated calls for</v>
<v Speaker 3>a call.</v>

3094
02:18:49.060 --> 02:18:51.070
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they want to kill the seals.</v>

3095
02:18:51.370 --> 02:18:52.203
<v Speaker 3>So to save the fish market,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they're going to get people to buy </v>

3096
02:18:54.191 --> 02:18:54.660
<v Speaker 3>dick.</v>

3097
02:18:54.660 --> 02:18:56.460
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So They make it financially viable.</v>

3098
02:18:56.500 --> 02:18:57.700
<v Speaker 3>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is racist.</v>

3099
02:18:57.970 --> 02:18:58.803
<v Speaker 3>The penises have juvenile adult animals </v>
<v Speaker 3>may be dried and sold as sexual </v>

3100
02:19:01.721 --> 02:19:04.150
<v Speaker 3>enhancement products,</v>
<v Speaker 3>particularly the asian buyers.</v>

3101
02:19:04.860 --> 02:19:05.693
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's because it's not meant to be </v>

3102
02:19:06.241 --> 02:19:08.340
<v Speaker 1>racist is because in traditional chinese</v>
<v Speaker 1>medicine,</v>

3103
02:19:08.341 --> 02:19:10.560
<v Speaker 1>the seal penis was used as a potency </v>
<v Speaker 1>product.</v>

3104
02:19:10.620 --> 02:19:12.030
<v Speaker 1>I understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the target,</v>

3105
02:19:12.031 --> 02:19:13.590
<v Speaker 1>those agents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those poor fools,</v>

3106
02:19:14.100 --> 02:19:15.660
<v Speaker 1>but they're not portfolios anymore </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know what?</v>

3107
02:19:15.661 --> 02:19:18.600
<v Speaker 1>They switched.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we wrote this paper and literally the</v>

3108
02:19:18.601 --> 02:19:21.300
<v Speaker 1>world wildlife fund attacks tax us and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>did not see that coming.</v>

3109
02:19:21.301 --> 02:19:22.490
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

3110
02:19:22.500 --> 02:19:23.333
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world wildlife fund is going to be </v>

3111
02:19:24.031 --> 02:19:26.250
<v Speaker 1>psyched because here's some good news </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a change.</v>

3112
02:19:26.610 --> 02:19:27.770
<v Speaker 1>But they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good news,</v>

3113
02:19:27.771 --> 02:19:28.130
<v Speaker 1>they only</v>

3114
02:19:28.130 --> 02:19:31.790
<v Speaker 2>want bad news because people pay and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they do what they can to fix things when</v>

3115
02:19:31.791 --> 02:19:35.000
<v Speaker 2>it's bad news and they forget that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>got to have some good news along the way</v>

3116
02:19:35.001 --> 02:19:38.420
<v Speaker 2>or people give up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at this list says here,</v>

3117
02:19:38.630 --> 02:19:39.463
<v Speaker 2>asian consumers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly athletes also consume a </v>

3118
02:19:41.751 --> 02:19:43.400
<v Speaker 2>beverage called.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you say that?</v>

3119
02:19:43.401 --> 02:19:47.570
<v Speaker 2>Dallas shen oral liquid that is made </v>
<v Speaker 2>from seal penis and testicles,</v>

3120
02:19:47.720 --> 02:19:51.230
<v Speaker 2>which they believe to be energizing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>performance enhancing.</v>

3121
02:19:51.530 --> 02:19:53.060
<v Speaker 2>How about some studies?</v>
<v Speaker 2>motherfucker,</v>

3122
02:19:53.061 --> 02:19:56.540
<v Speaker 2>before you start eating sealed dick's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>try it.</v>

3123
02:19:56.560 --> 02:19:57.760
<v Speaker 2>See a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3124
02:19:58.770 --> 02:19:59.740
<v Speaker 2>don't need that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Check it.</v>

3125
02:20:00.240 --> 02:20:02.240
<v Speaker 2>Why would you take that one?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can get fucking viagra.</v>

3126
02:20:02.300 --> 02:20:04.340
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guarantee a viagra is better.</v>

3127
02:20:04.400 --> 02:20:06.140
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if it's not better,</v>

3128
02:20:06.170 --> 02:20:08.360
<v Speaker 2>it's good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what are you trying to do?</v>

3129
02:20:08.680 --> 02:20:10.220
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we actually,</v>

3130
02:20:10.700 --> 02:20:12.470
<v Speaker 2>because we got attacked by the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>wildlife fund,</v>

3131
02:20:12.471 --> 02:20:13.304
<v Speaker 2>we sent a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of my graduate student from Hong </v>

3132
02:20:15.890 --> 02:20:16.723
<v Speaker 2>Kong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we descend them to go back to Hong Kong </v>

3133
02:20:17.631 --> 02:20:19.500
<v Speaker 2>for the holidays to go back to you.</v>

3134
02:20:19.980 --> 02:20:21.770
<v Speaker 2>The world wildlife fund,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they said that were wrong.</v>

3135
02:20:21.771 --> 02:20:23.630
<v Speaker 2>people won't switch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They say,</v>

3136
02:20:23.631 --> 02:20:24.310
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How would,</v>

3137
02:20:24.310 --> 02:20:26.270
<v Speaker 2>how did they phrase it where they wrote </v>
<v Speaker 2>an article?</v>

3138
02:20:26.271 --> 02:20:27.840
<v Speaker 2>They rebutted us and they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3139
02:20:27.860 --> 02:20:28.820
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our data show,</v>

3140
02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:30.790
<v Speaker 2>when we tried to get people to switch </v>
<v Speaker 2>from ryan,</v>

3141
02:20:30.791 --> 02:20:32.110
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and tiger horn to aspirin,</v>

3142
02:20:32.120 --> 02:20:32.953
<v Speaker 2>they wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they want sprint so they won't </v>

3143
02:20:34.851 --> 02:20:36.200
<v Speaker 2>switch to viagara.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

3144
02:20:36.201 --> 02:20:37.940
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think fire is different from aspirin.</v>

3145
02:20:38.090 --> 02:20:39.500
<v Speaker 2>I got a headache,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I take an aspirin.</v>

3146
02:20:39.690 --> 02:20:40.523
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think my headache got better faster </v>

3147
02:20:41.721 --> 02:20:43.400
<v Speaker 2>than it would have otherwise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A little bit vague.</v>

3148
02:20:43.700 --> 02:20:44.960
<v Speaker 2>You need a viagra,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you take it.</v>

3149
02:20:44.961 --> 02:20:45.441
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yep,</v>

3150
02:20:45.441 --> 02:20:46.274
<v Speaker 2>that sucker worked right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's visual evidence and so we argue </v>

3151
02:20:48.761 --> 02:20:49.594
<v Speaker 2>that it's different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we actually went into these </v>

3152
02:20:51.231 --> 02:20:52.064
<v Speaker 2>clinics and we asked people in </v>
<v Speaker 2>traditional chinese clinics in Hong </v>

3153
02:20:55.310 --> 02:20:56.750
<v Speaker 2>Kong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you take for a headache?</v>

3154
02:20:56.750 --> 02:20:59.150
<v Speaker 2>What do you take for gout?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you take for rectal dysfunction?</v>

3155
02:20:59.330 --> 02:21:01.070
<v Speaker 2>And that was the one case where they'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>switched.</v>

3156
02:21:01.370 --> 02:21:03.800
<v Speaker 2>So consumers all over the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they know when a pro,</v>

3157
02:21:03.850 --> 02:21:06.320
<v Speaker 2>a better product comes along.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They know when they've got no options.</v>

3158
02:21:06.321 --> 02:21:07.410
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might as well eat seals,</v>

3159
02:21:07.460 --> 02:21:10.610
<v Speaker 2>penis because that's as good as anything</v>
<v Speaker 2>or because nothing works.</v>

3160
02:21:11.090 --> 02:21:13.520
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you'll get a little bit of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>placebo effect or you know.</v>

3161
02:21:13.521 --> 02:21:13.881
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

3162
02:21:13.881 --> 02:21:15.230
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something that actually works.</v>

3163
02:21:15.231 --> 02:21:17.210
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm going to buy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I read about the.</v>

3164
02:21:17.270 --> 02:21:22.140
<v Speaker 2>One of the issues with rhino horn with </v>
<v Speaker 2>some asian buyers is that also it's a.</v>

3165
02:21:22.430 --> 02:21:25.430
<v Speaker 2>It's a signal of affluence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly right.</v>

3166
02:21:25.580 --> 02:21:27.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's prestige purchase,</v>

3167
02:21:27.140 --> 02:21:27.973
<v Speaker 2>so sad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is sad as shit ever because that is </v>

3168
02:21:30.681 --> 02:21:35.681
<v Speaker 2>such a crazy animal bizarre creature </v>
<v Speaker 2>that almost seems like a living dinosaur</v>

3169
02:21:36.650 --> 02:21:40.130
<v Speaker 2>it looks at and we're losing them left </v>
<v Speaker 2>and right now because people are killing</v>

3170
02:21:40.131 --> 02:21:40.964
<v Speaker 2>them for their fucking horn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which just basically just collagen </v>

3171
02:21:44.120 --> 02:21:44.720
<v Speaker 2>fingernail.</v>

3172
02:21:44.720 --> 02:21:46.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's bananas.</v>

3173
02:21:46.820 --> 02:21:49.850
<v Speaker 2>IT just doesn't make any sense to me </v>
<v Speaker 2>that that is still,</v>

3174
02:21:49.910 --> 02:21:53.540
<v Speaker 2>that they haven't realized that there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>no value in it,</v>

3175
02:21:53.570 --> 02:21:56.700
<v Speaker 2>that there's no physical value.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't really give you erections and</v>

3176
02:21:57.850 --> 02:21:58.990
<v Speaker 2>fever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fever.</v>

3177
02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:00.680
<v Speaker 2>It's got to have a long list </v>
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately,</v>

3178
02:22:01.390 --> 02:22:02.700
<v Speaker 2>and then they're still buying it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're.</v>

3179
02:22:03.050 --> 02:22:06.020
<v Speaker 2>And they're buying it again for athletes</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they get a kick.</v>

3180
02:22:06.021 --> 02:22:07.520
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like buying a maserati.</v>

3181
02:22:07.700 --> 02:22:09.770
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's so crazy.</v>

3182
02:22:10.460 --> 02:22:12.260
<v Speaker 2>That's so sad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3183
02:22:12.261 --> 02:22:13.820
<v Speaker 2>my daughter's outside the door.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hi.</v>

3184
02:22:14.240 --> 02:22:15.410
<v Speaker 2>Get out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You bothering us?</v>

3185
02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:17.811
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeAh.</v>

3186
02:22:17.811 --> 02:22:21.680
<v Speaker 2>It's so strange to me that there are </v>
<v Speaker 2>these specific cases,</v>

3187
02:22:21.681 --> 02:22:22.371
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3188
02:22:22.371 --> 02:22:23.204
<v Speaker 2>it's not like people are looking for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>giraffe horns like funny is they're </v>

3189
02:22:26.491 --> 02:22:29.820
<v Speaker 2>looking for rhino horn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what do you think that they made an</v>

3190
02:22:29.821 --> 02:22:31.290
<v Speaker 2>association like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>damn,</v>

3191
02:22:31.291 --> 02:22:33.440
<v Speaker 2>if I was jack liquor wine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh this chick's like,</v>

3192
02:22:33.510 --> 02:22:35.370
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to get that horn and eat it.</v>

3193
02:22:35.370 --> 02:22:36.203
<v Speaker 2>And my dick get hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I do think so because if you look </v>

3194
02:22:37.891 --> 02:22:38.724
<v Speaker 2>at the long list of products,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they look pretty phallic and mostly </v>

3195
02:22:40.891 --> 02:22:43.380
<v Speaker 2>people he'd phallic things in order to </v>
<v Speaker 2>gain potency.</v>

3196
02:22:43.440 --> 02:22:45.330
<v Speaker 2>Is there something crazy about seal </v>
<v Speaker 2>dicks?</v>

3197
02:22:45.750 --> 02:22:47.730
<v Speaker 2>Like what's going on with decently </v>
<v Speaker 2>sized?</v>

3198
02:22:47.760 --> 02:22:49.290
<v Speaker 2>Decent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A good word for that.</v>

3199
02:22:49.291 --> 02:22:52.380
<v Speaker 2>I like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you know,</v>

3200
02:22:52.381 --> 02:22:53.610
<v Speaker 2>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh that sucker,</v>

3201
02:22:53.611 --> 02:22:54.930
<v Speaker 2>I'll get big too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3202
02:22:55.440 --> 02:22:56.273
<v Speaker 2>We're so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's so weird that in the face of </v>

3203
02:22:58.651 --> 02:22:59.484
<v Speaker 2>new evidence that people haven't adopted</v>
<v Speaker 2>this new evidence and they still clean </v>

3204
02:23:03.181 --> 02:23:04.530
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At least some people claim to.</v>

3205
02:23:04.570 --> 02:23:06.100
<v Speaker 2>But here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So our,</v>

3206
02:23:06.260 --> 02:23:09.270
<v Speaker 2>our pre modern ancestors didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand germs at all,</v>

3207
02:23:09.271 --> 02:23:10.350
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was no way they could have.</v>

3208
02:23:10.351 --> 02:23:12.840
<v Speaker 2>It's such a bizarre idea that something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that small could kill you,</v>

3209
02:23:13.050 --> 02:23:15.300
<v Speaker 2>but they did know that if I touched you </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you were sick,</v>

3210
02:23:15.301 --> 02:23:16.380
<v Speaker 2>I might end up sick too.</v>

3211
02:23:16.740 --> 02:23:19.260
<v Speaker 2>And that seems almost like a magical </v>
<v Speaker 2>transference.</v>

3212
02:23:19.380 --> 02:23:21.360
<v Speaker 2>And if you accept this and they all know</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

3213
02:23:21.540 --> 02:23:22.373
<v Speaker 2>like they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll,</v>

3214
02:23:22.410 --> 02:23:23.880
<v Speaker 2>they'll shy away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all evolve.</v>

3215
02:23:23.910 --> 02:23:24.743
<v Speaker 2>chimpanzees will shy away from </v>
<v Speaker 2>disgusting stuff and open source and </v>

3216
02:23:28.110 --> 02:23:28.980
<v Speaker 2>people really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3217
02:23:28.981 --> 02:23:29.814
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you get the right kinds of illness </v>

3218
02:23:30.691 --> 02:23:32.110
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that manifests,</v>

3219
02:23:32.130 --> 02:23:34.770
<v Speaker 2>that you're seriously outwardly sick and</v>
<v Speaker 2>contagious,</v>

3220
02:23:34.771 --> 02:23:39.000
<v Speaker 2>people find it disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that kind of magical contagion.</v>

3221
02:23:39.030 --> 02:23:39.863
<v Speaker 2>It's super easy to see why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well then it make you think that while </v>

3222
02:23:41.671 --> 02:23:43.850
<v Speaker 2>ryan and warren will make my dick bigger</v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

3223
02:23:43.960 --> 02:23:45.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess,</v>

3224
02:23:46.110 --> 02:23:47.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are there any instances where that stuff</v>

3225
02:23:47.941 --> 02:23:49.950
<v Speaker 2>is real where it does actually work that</v>
<v Speaker 2>way?</v>

3226
02:23:50.880 --> 02:23:52.410
<v Speaker 2>Not that I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't think of any,</v>

3227
02:23:52.920 --> 02:23:54.670
<v Speaker 2>but it is the case that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you,</v>

3228
02:23:54.671 --> 02:23:57.120
<v Speaker 2>you being sick Will make me sick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No question,</v>

3229
02:23:57.121 --> 02:24:00.240
<v Speaker 2>but nothing that like you eat and </v>
<v Speaker 2>animals thing you consume.</v>

3230
02:24:00.600 --> 02:24:01.770
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but If it is the case,</v>

3231
02:24:01.771 --> 02:24:04.610
<v Speaker 2>imagine that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that like after you and I chat you said,</v>

3232
02:24:04.611 --> 02:24:05.161
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bill here,</v>

3233
02:24:05.161 --> 02:24:07.620
<v Speaker 2>have my jacket,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now I go out with your jacket on.</v>

3234
02:24:07.621 --> 02:24:08.371
<v Speaker 2>And people go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh man,</v>

3235
02:24:08.371 --> 02:24:09.204
<v Speaker 2>he's got joe rogan jacket,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's cool and now I've got a little bit </v>

3236
02:24:10.951 --> 02:24:13.400
<v Speaker 2>of your cool and now the girls are like </v>
<v Speaker 2>me too.</v>

3237
02:24:14.430 --> 02:24:15.263
<v Speaker 2>LIke when hercules put the lion's head </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the head over and the lions thing on </v>

3238
02:24:19.970 --> 02:24:23.190
<v Speaker 2>it that you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you kicked some ass to have that thing.</v>

3239
02:24:23.220 --> 02:24:24.510
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3240
02:24:24.810 --> 02:24:25.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess,</v>

3241
02:24:25.940 --> 02:24:27.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

3242
02:24:28.760 --> 02:24:30.670
<v Speaker 2>we're so weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3243
02:24:31.170 --> 02:24:32.003
<v Speaker 2>just uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the human animal itself is just such a </v>

3244
02:24:33.571 --> 02:24:34.404
<v Speaker 2>strange thing and the more you study it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more you go deeper and deeper into </v>

3245
02:24:37.201 --> 02:24:38.034
<v Speaker 2>the layers of weirdness that we are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And psychology is pretty good about </v>

3246
02:24:41.701 --> 02:24:44.070
<v Speaker 2>finding out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our average weirdnesses were not so good</v>

3247
02:24:44.071 --> 02:24:44.904
<v Speaker 2>at finding out they're really unusual </v>
<v Speaker 2>weirdnesses because we can't predict </v>

3248
02:24:46.741 --> 02:24:48.870
<v Speaker 2>that one out of a thousand behavior very</v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

3249
02:24:49.170 --> 02:24:52.140
<v Speaker 2>We can predict what people tend to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>when the bell curves tend to split.</v>

3250
02:24:52.350 --> 02:24:53.183
<v Speaker 2>We can't say what some random psycho or </v>
<v Speaker 2>genius or artist or whatever we'll do </v>

3251
02:24:56.611 --> 02:24:59.520
<v Speaker 2>under those circumstances because that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>not what our models are designed for.</v>

3252
02:24:59.870 --> 02:25:02.010
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's um,</v>

3253
02:25:02.390 --> 02:25:05.130
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so interesting when you think about</v>

3254
02:25:05.131 --> 02:25:05.964
<v Speaker 2>our interactions also with all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>various animals that we've come up come </v>

3255
02:25:10.381 --> 02:25:12.030
<v Speaker 2>across like all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all throughout our,</v>

3256
02:25:12.330 --> 02:25:15.870
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our life as human beings and that people</v>

3257
02:25:15.871 --> 02:25:19.880
<v Speaker 2>have chosen some to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some to cherish and some to,</v>

3258
02:25:20.190 --> 02:25:23.770
<v Speaker 2>some to take on as food sources and some</v>
<v Speaker 2>to worship and,</v>

3259
02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:25.960
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and often it makes good sense.</v>

3260
02:25:26.170 --> 02:25:28.580
<v Speaker 2>So dogs are great because we have great </v>
<v Speaker 2>vision though.</v>

3261
02:25:28.581 --> 02:25:29.414
<v Speaker 2>Our noses and ears don't work very well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we could have somebody around who </v>

3262
02:25:31.661 --> 02:25:33.640
<v Speaker 2>could hear and smell well and is on our </v>
<v Speaker 2>side,</v>

3263
02:25:33.910 --> 02:25:35.230
<v Speaker 2>that's a huge plus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3264
02:25:35.230 --> 02:25:36.063
<v Speaker 2>It's worth feeding that thing or at </v>
<v Speaker 2>least tolerating it and they need some </v>

3265
02:25:37.951 --> 02:25:40.090
<v Speaker 2>scraps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And some of them cats,</v>

3266
02:25:40.150 --> 02:25:40.931
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're annoying.</v>

3267
02:25:40.931 --> 02:25:41.764
<v Speaker 2>They don't like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're good at killing rats and </v>

3268
02:25:43.151 --> 02:25:45.370
<v Speaker 2>other vermin that would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once we were agriculturalists,</v>

3269
02:25:45.610 --> 02:25:47.380
<v Speaker 2>those kind of vermin would have been a </v>
<v Speaker 2>real problem.</v>

3270
02:25:47.440 --> 02:25:49.870
<v Speaker 2>They'd have been largely irrelevant when</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're still hunter gatherers,</v>

3271
02:25:50.380 --> 02:25:51.213
<v Speaker 2>but so we had dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We domesticated those while we were </v>

3272
02:25:53.081 --> 02:25:53.914
<v Speaker 2>hunter gatherers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but cat's the best I know is like </v>

3273
02:25:55.781 --> 02:25:56.614
<v Speaker 2>ancient Egypt and these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these societies and in that storing </v>

3274
02:25:58.570 --> 02:26:01.780
<v Speaker 2>grain and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So those ancient systems make good sense</v>

3275
02:26:01.781 --> 02:26:02.614
<v Speaker 2>that you're making a deal with an animal</v>
<v Speaker 2>that can achieve something that you </v>

3276
02:26:04.481 --> 02:26:05.314
<v Speaker 2>can't achieve and of course you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>living in a world without chemicals and </v>

3277
02:26:07.361 --> 02:26:08.194
<v Speaker 2>machines and all that kind of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but tons of them are just totally </v>

3278
02:26:11.111 --> 02:26:11.944
<v Speaker 2>random.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in this culture that thing is a </v>

3279
02:26:13.210 --> 02:26:14.320
<v Speaker 2>worshiped in this culture.</v>

3280
02:26:14.320 --> 02:26:16.420
<v Speaker 2>It's eaten and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that,</v>

3281
02:26:16.510 --> 02:26:18.250
<v Speaker 2>that sort of stuff is super hard to </v>
<v Speaker 2>predict.</v>

3282
02:26:18.490 --> 02:26:20.950
<v Speaker 2>Now in studying all this stuff and </v>
<v Speaker 2>writing this book,</v>

3283
02:26:21.040 --> 02:26:24.760
<v Speaker 2>how much has this changed the way you </v>
<v Speaker 2>just see humans?</v>

3284
02:26:24.761 --> 02:26:27.840
<v Speaker 2>Like as you're just going to the mall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does change it,</v>

3285
02:26:27.841 --> 02:26:28.511
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you see,</v>

3286
02:26:28.511 --> 02:26:31.540
<v Speaker 2>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember being proud of my son when he</v>

3287
02:26:31.541 --> 02:26:36.400
<v Speaker 2>told a lie because I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh good I made and so we're in the,</v>

3288
02:26:36.480 --> 02:26:39.880
<v Speaker 2>we're in the playground and this little </v>
<v Speaker 2>boys playing with him and my son doesn't</v>

3289
02:26:39.881 --> 02:26:40.714
<v Speaker 2>have a lunchbox at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't own one and the little boy </v>

3290
02:26:42.581 --> 02:26:45.700
<v Speaker 2>says I got a spiderman lunchbox and my </v>
<v Speaker 2>son is like four,</v>

3291
02:26:45.701 --> 02:26:46.534
<v Speaker 2>four and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he looks at the kid and he doesn't </v>

3292
02:26:47.651 --> 02:26:48.484
<v Speaker 2>know spiderman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's because he hasn't seen the show </v>

3293
02:26:49.121 --> 02:26:50.670
<v Speaker 2>yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he knows it's obvious.</v>

3294
02:26:50.680 --> 02:26:51.260
<v Speaker 2>The kids bragging.</v>

3295
02:26:51.260 --> 02:26:52.750
<v Speaker 2>It's obviously something good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>

3296
02:26:52.751 --> 02:26:53.920
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a grasp man.</v>

3297
02:26:53.980 --> 02:26:57.650
<v Speaker 2>And a leaf man lunchbox.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody.</v>

3298
02:26:57.670 --> 02:26:58.810
<v Speaker 2>He just made the shit up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3299
02:26:59.190 --> 02:27:00.850
<v Speaker 2>Because spiders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3300
02:27:00.851 --> 02:27:03.700
<v Speaker 2>The spiderman or a grasp and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking around for other things.</v>

3301
02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:04.833
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I was actually proud of it </v>

3302
02:27:05.651 --> 02:27:07.690
<v Speaker 2>because it showed a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got theory mind down,</v>

3303
02:27:07.840 --> 02:27:09.520
<v Speaker 2>he knows what the kid can and can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>

3304
02:27:09.670 --> 02:27:10.503
<v Speaker 2>And b,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he knows that telling these stories are </v>

3305
02:27:12.040 --> 02:27:14.560
<v Speaker 2>gonna be important for his place in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>social hierarchy.</v>

3306
02:27:14.800 --> 02:27:16.990
<v Speaker 2>So the kid looks at me and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying not to laugh,</v>

3307
02:27:17.020 --> 02:27:19.330
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I got to support my son and he's</v>

3308
02:27:19.331 --> 02:27:19.991
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>

3309
02:27:19.991 --> 02:27:21.490
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>damn right kid.</v>

3310
02:27:23.030 --> 02:27:26.440
<v Speaker 2>And so you can imagine that it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>without this background,</v>

3311
02:27:26.441 --> 02:27:27.370
<v Speaker 2>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

3312
02:27:27.371 --> 02:27:28.204
<v Speaker 2>we should discourage this kind of lying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it gives you a little bit of a </v>

3313
02:27:30.371 --> 02:27:31.300
<v Speaker 2>different perspective on it.</v>

3314
02:27:31.310 --> 02:27:32.890
<v Speaker 2>It also probably weird because you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3315
02:27:32.891 --> 02:27:34.150
<v Speaker 2>your kid realizes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3316
02:27:34.151 --> 02:27:35.520
<v Speaker 2>my dad's got my back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3317
02:27:35.590 --> 02:27:38.800
<v Speaker 2>well that's good to know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thanks bro.</v>

3318
02:27:39.400 --> 02:27:40.233
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then she'd always have your kids </v>

3319
02:27:41.141 --> 02:27:42.070
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3320
02:27:42.340 --> 02:27:44.440
<v Speaker 2>But grass man and leaf man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to pull them aside.</v>

3321
02:27:44.441 --> 02:27:44.801
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

3322
02:27:44.801 --> 02:27:48.520
<v Speaker 2>you gotta come up with an animal to try </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do something that's got.</v>

3323
02:27:49.240 --> 02:27:50.740
<v Speaker 2>Well congrats man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually do.</v>

3324
02:27:50.770 --> 02:27:53.790
<v Speaker 2>Besides photosynthesize by cow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

3325
02:27:54.490 --> 02:27:56.560
<v Speaker 2>But he was on the spur of the moment and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's only four.</v>

3326
02:27:56.561 --> 02:27:58.600
<v Speaker 2>So I decided it was good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3327
02:27:58.800 --> 02:28:02.440
<v Speaker 2>that that is also cattle worshiping is </v>
<v Speaker 2>very fascinating to um,</v>

3328
02:28:02.590 --> 02:28:05.260
<v Speaker 2>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the hindus and all these different,</v>

3329
02:28:05.620 --> 02:28:06.453
<v Speaker 2>different tribes and different cultures </v>
<v Speaker 2>that were shipped cattle were other </v>

3330
02:28:09.551 --> 02:28:11.170
<v Speaker 2>people just thought of them as food </v>
<v Speaker 2>sources.</v>

3331
02:28:11.230 --> 02:28:12.370
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so again,</v>

3332
02:28:12.410 --> 02:28:15.190
<v Speaker 2>now I don't know the origins that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you could imagine a system whereby,</v>

3333
02:28:15.191 --> 02:28:18.670
<v Speaker 2>well if you keep cattle and you benefit </v>
<v Speaker 2>from them rather than eating them,</v>

3334
02:28:18.671 --> 02:28:20.020
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get some gains from </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

3335
02:28:20.050 --> 02:28:22.070
<v Speaker 2>And we do know when you shift from being</v>
<v Speaker 2>a hunter</v>

3336
02:28:22.070 --> 02:28:23.990
<v Speaker 1>gatherer to basically kill in an eaton </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>

3337
02:28:24.140 --> 02:28:24.973
<v Speaker 1>to being a pastoralist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so your cattle or sheep or whatever or </v>

3338
02:28:27.351 --> 02:28:30.440
<v Speaker 1>to being a farmer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you suddenly have to start taking on the</v>

3339
02:28:30.441 --> 02:28:31.274
<v Speaker 1>long game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So humans are perfectly capable of </v>

3340
02:28:33.440 --> 02:28:36.080
<v Speaker 1>envisioning unfelt needs no matter what </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of society they're in.</v>

3341
02:28:36.260 --> 02:28:38.770
<v Speaker 1>But hunter gatherers they're living for </v>
<v Speaker 1>today and so it's,</v>

3342
02:28:38.860 --> 02:28:39.830
<v Speaker 1>it's kill it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3343
02:28:39.860 --> 02:28:41.840
<v Speaker 1>hunted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shared out amongst all of us.</v>

3344
02:28:41.960 --> 02:28:45.560
<v Speaker 1>And then we eat it and then we'll worry </v>
<v Speaker 1>about tomorrow when it comes along.</v>

3345
02:28:45.830 --> 02:28:48.380
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you shift to having herds or having</v>

3346
02:28:48.381 --> 02:28:49.130
<v Speaker 1>land,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't.</v>

3347
02:28:49.130 --> 02:28:49.963
<v Speaker 1>That psychology doesn't work anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what's super interesting is it </v>

3348
02:28:52.701 --> 02:28:53.534
<v Speaker 1>took literally like 10 or 20,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years we've got the implements in place </v>

3349
02:28:57.470 --> 02:29:00.440
<v Speaker 1>to be agricultural is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're not planting and it just,</v>

3350
02:29:00.441 --> 02:29:02.060
<v Speaker 1>we're just grinding stuff that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>gather.</v>

3351
02:29:02.061 --> 02:29:04.040
<v Speaker 1>And why did it take so long to plant </v>
<v Speaker 1>when maybe it was,</v>

3352
02:29:04.041 --> 02:29:05.390
<v Speaker 1>whether,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it was a bunch of things,</v>

3353
02:29:05.600 --> 02:29:08.150
<v Speaker 1>but part of it is you have to shift your</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology over and say,</v>

3354
02:29:08.151 --> 02:29:09.830
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to stop thinking about eating,</v>

3355
02:29:09.930 --> 02:29:11.540
<v Speaker 1>killing and eating it today.</v>

3356
02:29:11.540 --> 02:29:12.141
<v Speaker 1>I got to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3357
02:29:12.141 --> 02:29:12.974
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well would it be beneficial to me to </v>

3358
02:29:14.750 --> 02:29:15.583
<v Speaker 1>keep this beast around and have it for </v>
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow and drink it's blood or it's </v>

3359
02:29:18.621 --> 02:29:19.454
<v Speaker 1>milk or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one way to get there might have </v>

3360
02:29:21.261 --> 02:29:22.094
<v Speaker 1>been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well let's create a religion that says </v>

3361
02:29:23.301 --> 02:29:25.280
<v Speaker 1>we can't eat them today because that'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>solve it immediately.</v>

3362
02:29:25.460 --> 02:29:27.890
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one way to look at it.</v>

3363
02:29:27.891 --> 02:29:28.724
<v Speaker 1>But have you ever looked into some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the other hypothesis on the origin of </v>

3364
02:29:31.851 --> 02:29:32.684
<v Speaker 1>cattle worship?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it again has to do with </v>

3365
02:29:34.251 --> 02:29:35.440
<v Speaker 1>psilocybin because.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3366
02:29:35.540 --> 02:29:36.890
<v Speaker 1>that could be too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'd be totally cool.</v>

3367
02:29:37.130 --> 02:29:39.110
<v Speaker 1>Grown cow shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that'd be totally cool.</v>

3368
02:29:39.111 --> 02:29:39.944
<v Speaker 1>And not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it would because it has benefits so </v>

3369
02:29:41.171 --> 02:29:42.830
<v Speaker 1>like societies can do anything they </v>
<v Speaker 1>want,</v>

3370
02:29:42.980 --> 02:29:45.140
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's some crazy systems that they</v>

3371
02:29:45.141 --> 02:29:46.970
<v Speaker 1>do in a lot of those are really bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>

3372
02:29:47.210 --> 02:29:48.043
<v Speaker 1>There's sources of infection and disease</v>
<v Speaker 1>and death and those societies tend not </v>

3373
02:29:50.841 --> 02:29:51.674
<v Speaker 1>to grow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but societies that do things that </v>

3374
02:29:53.001 --> 02:29:53.834
<v Speaker 1>happened to be good ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if they got it from mushrooms and </v>

3375
02:29:55.611 --> 02:29:58.700
<v Speaker 1>things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are going to really pass along.</v>

3376
02:29:58.700 --> 02:30:01.070
<v Speaker 1>And so you've got a lot of people on </v>
<v Speaker 1>this planet to worship cows,</v>

3377
02:30:01.310 --> 02:30:02.143
<v Speaker 1>which suggests that whatever got that </v>
<v Speaker 1>started actually probably had a benefit </v>

3378
02:30:04.761 --> 02:30:07.980
<v Speaker 1>because those societies grew and </v>
<v Speaker 1>worshiping god,</v>

3379
02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:09.290
<v Speaker 1>not something like when you come to me </v>
<v Speaker 1>and say,</v>

3380
02:30:09.291 --> 02:30:11.210
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I worship cows and I'm thinking,</v>

3381
02:30:12.490 --> 02:30:13.151
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3382
02:30:13.151 --> 02:30:14.510
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather eat them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but fine.</v>

3383
02:30:14.840 --> 02:30:15.673
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to imagine being persuaded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's easy to imagine growing up in </v>

3384
02:30:18.141 --> 02:30:19.640
<v Speaker 1>that system over imitating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3385
02:30:19.641 --> 02:30:20.474
<v Speaker 1>We talked about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You automatically just copy to add </v>

3386
02:30:22.641 --> 02:30:23.301
<v Speaker 1>warships,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cows,</v>

3387
02:30:23.301 --> 02:30:25.190
<v Speaker 1>things are working out well for him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll do the same.</v>

3388
02:30:25.580 --> 02:30:28.220
<v Speaker 1>And then you've got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a good thing for your society</v>

3389
02:30:28.221 --> 02:30:29.054
<v Speaker 1>too because you can drink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's blood or it's milk or whichever </v>

3390
02:30:30.590 --> 02:30:32.180
<v Speaker 1>you're lactose tolerant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you do,</v>

3391
02:30:32.510 --> 02:30:34.340
<v Speaker 1>and then that allows you to society to </v>
<v Speaker 1>grow.</v>

3392
02:30:34.580 --> 02:30:39.530
<v Speaker 1>Was there anything surprising to you in </v>
<v Speaker 1>writing this book and researching it and</v>

3393
02:30:39.531 --> 02:30:40.310
<v Speaker 1>putting it together?</v>

3394
02:30:40.310 --> 02:30:43.970
<v Speaker 1>Was there anything that really just had </v>
<v Speaker 1>made you step back and go,</v>

3395
02:30:43.971 --> 02:30:46.460
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't see that one common look.</v>

3396
02:30:46.461 --> 02:30:47.294
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of things that I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>see coming and a lot of times where I </v>

3397
02:30:49.041 --> 02:30:52.160
<v Speaker 1>thought I had an idea of how it all </v>
<v Speaker 1>worked and then I thought I would read a</v>

3398
02:30:52.161 --> 02:30:53.180
<v Speaker 1>lot more papers and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3399
02:30:53.181 --> 02:30:54.014
<v Speaker 1>that's not even possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't have that capability or </v>

3400
02:30:55.491 --> 02:30:58.220
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What surprised me was that I.</v>

3401
02:30:58.540 --> 02:30:59.373
<v Speaker 1>A big part of where this book comes from</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that then colleagues would say they </v>

3402
02:31:02.301 --> 02:31:03.560
<v Speaker 1>would know I'm working on this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they'd say,</v>

3403
02:31:03.561 --> 02:31:04.394
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come give a talk at my conference on </v>

3404
02:31:05.541 --> 02:31:06.890
<v Speaker 1>leadership,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'd say,</v>

3405
02:31:06.891 --> 02:31:07.724
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know anything about leadership </v>

3406
02:31:08.160 --> 02:31:08.600
<v Speaker 1>nickel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3407
02:31:08.600 --> 02:31:10.880
<v Speaker 1>surely something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It must have implications for that,</v>

3408
02:31:11.240 --> 02:31:13.510
<v Speaker 1>and every time they asked me to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3409
02:31:13.520 --> 02:31:14.450
<v Speaker 1>I'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3410
02:31:14.451 --> 02:31:15.284
<v Speaker 1>I'll give it a try.</v>

3411
02:31:15.440 --> 02:31:17.260
<v Speaker 1>And then literally you sit down and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think about it,</v>

3412
02:31:17.290 --> 02:31:17.781
<v Speaker 1>you realize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

3413
02:31:17.781 --> 02:31:21.330
<v Speaker 1>there are important implications for </v>
<v Speaker 1>leadership or innovation or happiness or</v>

3414
02:31:21.331 --> 02:31:22.164
<v Speaker 1>sociality and I never saw them coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it was literally friends of mine </v>

3415
02:31:25.411 --> 02:31:26.244
<v Speaker 1>kind of forced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had one goal which is to just </v>

3416
02:31:27.481 --> 02:31:28.314
<v Speaker 1>understand social intelligence and how </v>
<v Speaker 1>did we become so socially intelligent </v>

3417
02:31:31.800 --> 02:31:32.633
<v Speaker 1>and the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was where I started in friends </v>

3418
02:31:35.011 --> 02:31:36.480
<v Speaker 1>just kept asking me to look at other </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

3419
02:31:36.481 --> 02:31:38.130
<v Speaker 1>And every time I did there was an </v>
<v Speaker 1>answer.</v>

3420
02:31:38.160 --> 02:31:40.020
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it was an answer that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>easier to find.</v>

3421
02:31:40.021 --> 02:31:42.240
<v Speaker 1>It seems harder to find,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was always there.</v>

3422
02:31:42.570 --> 02:31:43.403
<v Speaker 1>And what that tells me is that there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>really a lot of value in taking the </v>

3423
02:31:46.651 --> 02:31:49.080
<v Speaker 1>anthropology and the biology and putting</v>
<v Speaker 1>them together and saying,</v>

3424
02:31:49.081 --> 02:31:50.250
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where did we come from?</v>

3425
02:31:50.460 --> 02:31:52.740
<v Speaker 1>And now what can that tell us about who </v>
<v Speaker 1>we are today?</v>

3426
02:31:52.950 --> 02:31:53.783
<v Speaker 1>That's an interesting.</v>

3427
02:31:53.920 --> 02:31:54.753
<v Speaker 3>It's sort of a intellectual exercise to </v>
<v Speaker 3>write a different perspective on the </v>

3428
02:31:59.301 --> 02:32:03.020
<v Speaker 3>material that you're going over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if somebody forces you into a little</v>

3429
02:32:03.021 --> 02:32:06.530
<v Speaker 3>box,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like tell me what you know,</v>

3430
02:32:06.740 --> 02:32:07.573
<v Speaker 3>what's the influence on or what the </v>
<v Speaker 3>impact on creativity or what's the </v>

3431
02:32:10.191 --> 02:32:11.024
<v Speaker 3>impact on leadership or all these </v>
<v Speaker 3>different things just to give you a </v>

3432
02:32:13.821 --> 02:32:15.980
<v Speaker 3>different view.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's look at it from the left.</v>

3433
02:32:16.010 --> 02:32:17.960
<v Speaker 3>Let's look at it from the top.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'll get it from below.</v>

3434
02:32:18.050 --> 02:32:20.010
<v Speaker 1>And that's what's so fun about sciences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can say,</v>

3435
02:32:20.011 --> 02:32:20.844
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well let's see if it tells us anything </v>

3436
02:32:22.111 --> 02:32:22.944
<v Speaker 1>that either we already know is true and </v>
<v Speaker 1>now we could get new things that we </v>

3437
02:32:25.081 --> 02:32:27.570
<v Speaker 1>would know about it or if it tells us </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that we don't even know,</v>

3438
02:32:27.571 --> 02:32:28.404
<v Speaker 1>but that might explain the way the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>is and both of those are valuable </v>

3439
02:32:30.991 --> 02:32:33.990
<v Speaker 1>because then you can run off and try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>test them and a lot of dead ends.</v>

3440
02:32:33.991 --> 02:32:34.824
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's what science is all about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some of them will hopefully not be </v>

3441
02:32:36.961 --> 02:32:38.640
<v Speaker 1>dead ends and you have runoff and test </v>
<v Speaker 1>and say,</v>

3442
02:32:38.641 --> 02:32:40.560
<v Speaker 1>holy shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now I understand innovation.</v>

3443
02:32:40.590 --> 02:32:41.510
<v Speaker 1>Now I understand whatever.</v>

3444
02:32:41.790 --> 02:32:42.623
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's interesting about this kind of </v>

3445
02:32:43.381 --> 02:32:47.760
<v Speaker 3>material is that it gives you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me as an individual,</v>

3446
02:32:47.761 --> 02:32:48.594
<v Speaker 3>it gives me insight in my own behavior </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think it would do a lot of people </v>

3447
02:32:53.880 --> 02:32:54.713
<v Speaker 3>do all of us some real good if we had a </v>
<v Speaker 3>better understanding of what our </v>

3448
02:32:58.621 --> 02:33:02.130
<v Speaker 3>motivations are and how we got to this </v>
<v Speaker 3>point in civilization,</v>

3449
02:33:02.430 --> 02:33:04.120
<v Speaker 3>what we actually are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3450
02:33:04.150 --> 02:33:06.630
<v Speaker 3>I mean maybe it will or won't change </v>
<v Speaker 3>your behavior,</v>

3451
02:33:06.631 --> 02:33:08.430
<v Speaker 3>but at least it will give you some </v>
<v Speaker 3>insight into.</v>

3452
02:33:09.040 --> 02:33:11.920
<v Speaker 1>I totally agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the thing is that when I find myself</v>

3453
02:33:11.921 --> 02:33:12.754
<v Speaker 1>getting upset because you disagree with </v>
<v Speaker 1>me about something trivial or even </v>

3454
02:33:15.280 --> 02:33:18.670
<v Speaker 1>important like politics or something and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it takes a second,</v>

3455
02:33:18.671 --> 02:33:19.191
<v Speaker 1>you got stumped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say,</v>

3456
02:33:19.191 --> 02:33:20.650
<v Speaker 1>hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any privilege.</v>

3457
02:33:20.651 --> 02:33:22.510
<v Speaker 1>Access to the right way to do things </v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3458
02:33:22.660 --> 02:33:23.493
<v Speaker 1>And so the fact that you care more about</v>
<v Speaker 1>x and I care more about why it doesn't </v>

3459
02:33:26.261 --> 02:33:28.930
<v Speaker 1>mean that you're an evil person and must</v>
<v Speaker 1>be overcome.</v>

3460
02:33:29.200 --> 02:33:32.680
<v Speaker 1>It means that probably we ought to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking to each other and trying to find</v>

3461
02:33:32.681 --> 02:33:34.870
<v Speaker 1>a compromise solution that makes things </v>
<v Speaker 1>work best.</v>

3462
02:33:34.900 --> 02:33:37.840
<v Speaker 1>But there's this automatic instead I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that you are evil,</v>

3463
02:33:38.250 --> 02:33:40.260
<v Speaker 1>absolutely with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the beauty of this kind of,</v>

3464
02:33:40.290 --> 02:33:42.830
<v Speaker 1>the more you know about this stuff in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the past and our evolutionary origins,</v>

3465
02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:43.833
<v Speaker 1>the more you know that literally we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolved to do that because if we didn't </v>

3466
02:33:46.271 --> 02:33:47.260
<v Speaker 1>do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're screwed,</v>

3467
02:33:47.500 --> 02:33:50.020
<v Speaker 1>but now we don't need to anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so now we can say,</v>

3468
02:33:50.021 --> 02:33:50.854
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold on,</v>

3469
02:33:50.950 --> 02:33:51.783
<v Speaker 1>I'm a lefty and you're in my example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a righty and we disagree about </v>

3470
02:33:55.331 --> 02:33:56.920
<v Speaker 1>this particular president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a fine.</v>

3471
02:33:57.130 --> 02:33:57.963
<v Speaker 1>Let's see if we can both agree on a goal</v>
<v Speaker 1>that will make both of us happy rather </v>

3472
02:34:00.071 --> 02:34:00.311
<v Speaker 1>than,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3473
02:34:00.311 --> 02:34:02.350
<v Speaker 1>you're evil and all I have to do is </v>
<v Speaker 1>overcome you.</v>

3474
02:34:02.710 --> 02:34:03.543
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that I've really tried</v>
<v Speaker 3>very hard from doing this podcast is to </v>

3475
02:34:07.121 --> 02:34:10.300
<v Speaker 3>not be attached to ideas and to do that </v>
<v Speaker 3>as an exercise.</v>

3476
02:34:10.301 --> 02:34:12.340
<v Speaker 3>And I think over the course of the years</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been doing this,</v>

3477
02:34:12.341 --> 02:34:14.320
<v Speaker 3>I've gotten way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>way better at that,</v>

3478
02:34:14.740 --> 02:34:19.240
<v Speaker 3>but it's just so fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I encounter in the raw form,</v>

3479
02:34:19.430 --> 02:34:20.263
<v Speaker 3>like when I go to a party and I just run</v>
<v Speaker 3>into some guy who's a dad and he brings </v>

3480
02:34:22.781 --> 02:34:24.370
<v Speaker 3>something up and I tell them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3481
02:34:24.400 --> 02:34:27.550
<v Speaker 3>that's not totally true because of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you see this.</v>

3482
02:34:27.970 --> 02:34:28.803
<v Speaker 3>The blood starts pumping,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the heart starts beating and they're </v>

3483
02:34:31.031 --> 02:34:35.500
<v Speaker 3>trying to look at some way you're wrong </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it becomes a personal thing.</v>

3484
02:34:35.501 --> 02:34:36.970
<v Speaker 3>It gets very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very heated</v>

3485
02:34:37.250 --> 02:34:40.940
<v Speaker 1>and it's easy for all of us to do that </v>
<v Speaker 1>in my job and your job is the same.</v>

3486
02:34:40.941 --> 02:34:42.140
<v Speaker 1>It's to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3487
02:34:42.141 --> 02:34:45.320
<v Speaker 1>is it time to abandon this idea?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there a time the defendant and when I</v>

3488
02:34:45.321 --> 02:34:48.080
<v Speaker 1>was young and an academic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was no way I was abandoning.</v>

3489
02:34:48.290 --> 02:34:50.610
<v Speaker 1>That was last quarter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was going to do is defense,</v>

3490
02:34:50.611 --> 02:34:53.540
<v Speaker 1>so you attack me and I marshall </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything I can and I try to attack you</v>

3491
02:34:53.541 --> 02:34:54.374
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was some of my colleagues were </v>

3492
02:34:55.311 --> 02:34:55.851
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

3493
02:34:55.851 --> 02:34:58.190
<v Speaker 1>you know when you're wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's cool.</v>

3494
02:34:58.191 --> 02:34:59.630
<v Speaker 1>That's what science is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

3495
02:34:59.631 --> 02:35:00.590
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>

3496
02:35:00.591 --> 02:35:01.580
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got to start.</v>

3497
02:35:01.790 --> 02:35:02.623
<v Speaker 1>And so now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though I love the give and take of </v>

3498
02:35:04.461 --> 02:35:06.950
<v Speaker 1>academics and I love to argue about </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff I tried really,</v>

3499
02:35:06.951 --> 02:35:07.784
<v Speaker 1>really hard to keep in my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well what if what You're saying right </v>

3500
02:35:09.801 --> 02:35:11.540
<v Speaker 1>now is right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rather than trying to just attack it,</v>

3501
02:35:11.541 --> 02:35:13.910
<v Speaker 1>which is my automatic instinct to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3502
02:35:14.060 --> 02:35:14.893
<v Speaker 1>what is it that you're saying now might </v>
<v Speaker 1>be a value that I should actually be </v>

3503
02:35:17.631 --> 02:35:19.090
<v Speaker 1>incorporating and not trying to stomp </v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

3504
02:35:19.350 --> 02:35:20.183
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And also just the ideas aren't you </v>

3505
02:35:23.160 --> 02:35:23.993
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your you and these ideas are just </v>

3506
02:35:25.291 --> 02:35:26.370
<v Speaker 3>something that you're tossing around</v>

3507
02:35:26.550 --> 02:35:27.980
<v Speaker 1>beach ball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly rIght.</v>

3508
02:35:27.981 --> 02:35:30.580
<v Speaker 1>And that's super hard to keep in mind </v>
<v Speaker 1>because everything that,</v>

3509
02:35:30.650 --> 02:35:32.990
<v Speaker 1>that we come to own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we get attached to.</v>

3510
02:35:33.350 --> 02:35:34.183
<v Speaker 1>And if I tend to have my ideas because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they tend to make the world a more </v>

3511
02:35:36.831 --> 02:35:40.730
<v Speaker 1>hospitable place to bill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in a way I kind of do need to defend</v>

3512
02:35:40.731 --> 02:35:43.860
<v Speaker 1>them because if you convince me no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way the world should work is whoever</v>

3513
02:35:43.861 --> 02:35:45.890
<v Speaker 1>is strongest gets everything while I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuffed.</v>

3514
02:35:46.340 --> 02:35:49.480
<v Speaker 1>And so I need to try to fight against a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of alternative views.</v>

3515
02:35:49.530 --> 02:35:51.740
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I have to overcome that in my effort</v>

3516
02:35:51.741 --> 02:35:53.540
<v Speaker 1>to find what the right answer is as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

3517
02:35:53.720 --> 02:35:54.553
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes good sense that our ideas are </v>

3518
02:35:55.821 --> 02:35:58.040
<v Speaker 1>like possessions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we have attitudes toward our ideas,</v>

3519
02:35:58.160 --> 02:35:59.990
<v Speaker 1>just like we have toured the objects </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we own,</v>

3520
02:35:59.991 --> 02:36:01.880
<v Speaker 1>that means something to us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to our family,</v>

3521
02:36:01.881 --> 02:36:02.780
<v Speaker 1>to our group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

3522
02:36:02.840 --> 02:36:06.530
<v Speaker 1>That all makes really good sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the other side of that coin is if we</v>

3523
02:36:07.010 --> 02:36:10.130
<v Speaker 1>talking about the way things used to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a premedical world,</v>

3524
02:36:11.030 --> 02:36:11.863
<v Speaker 1>if you're the chances of you carrying </v>
<v Speaker 1>different pathogens and I carry is </v>

3525
02:36:14.151 --> 02:36:16.670
<v Speaker 1>reasonably high and if you infect me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm screwed.</v>

3526
02:36:16.970 --> 02:36:17.803
<v Speaker 1>Now if you do tHings differently than I </v>
<v Speaker 1>do think so you eat this food and I eat </v>

3527
02:36:20.841 --> 02:36:22.700
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Food was different.</v>

3528
02:36:22.701 --> 02:36:23.534
<v Speaker 1>Could actually be wrong from my </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective because if I do what you've </v>

3529
02:36:25.791 --> 02:36:26.624
<v Speaker 1>done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like get myself sick because you've </v>

3530
02:36:27.411 --> 02:36:28.970
<v Speaker 1>adapted to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that thing.</v>

3531
02:36:29.180 --> 02:36:32.750
<v Speaker 1>And so we literally probably for good </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary reasons,</v>

3532
02:36:32.900 --> 02:36:33.733
<v Speaker 1>came to view cultural ways of doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that are different as if they're </v>

3533
02:36:35.630 --> 02:36:37.280
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that saved us,</v>

3534
02:36:37.281 --> 02:36:38.114
<v Speaker 1>that protected us from the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathogen vectors that you've gotten </v>

3535
02:36:40.161 --> 02:36:41.630
<v Speaker 1>adapted to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that I haven't.</v>

3536
02:36:42.110 --> 02:36:45.500
<v Speaker 1>That's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that this is almost like ingrained in</v>

3537
02:36:45.501 --> 02:36:46.210
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3538
02:36:46.210 --> 02:36:49.910
<v Speaker 1>as we've evolved to be this way and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to undo that.</v>

3539
02:36:50.550 --> 02:36:51.383
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that with the access to </v>
<v Speaker 3>information that we're currently </v>

3540
02:36:54.001 --> 02:36:54.834
<v Speaker 3>enjoying that because there's so much </v>
<v Speaker 3>information now and it's so easy to get </v>

3541
02:36:59.101 --> 02:36:59.934
<v Speaker 3>to that perhaps there'll be more </v>
<v Speaker 3>instances of people not becoming </v>

3542
02:37:04.321 --> 02:37:07.440
<v Speaker 3>attached to their ideas and recognizing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they are there.</v>

3543
02:37:07.441 --> 02:37:11.910
<v Speaker 3>They are separate the you are just to </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking organism and what the facts are</v>

3544
02:37:11.911 --> 02:37:16.070
<v Speaker 3>and what reality is is just something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's happening and you don't</v>

3545
02:37:16.070 --> 02:37:18.950
<v Speaker 2>have to be personally attached to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a part of your identity.</v>

3546
02:37:18.951 --> 02:37:23.000
<v Speaker 2>I hope so because in an ideal world we </v>
<v Speaker 2>could have the things that were attached</v>

3547
02:37:23.001 --> 02:37:26.090
<v Speaker 2>to that don't really matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm an iphone guy and you're an android,</v>

3548
02:37:26.140 --> 02:37:27.220
<v Speaker 2>but who cares?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3549
02:37:27.230 --> 02:37:29.310
<v Speaker 2>We cOuld argue about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'd be silly and have time.</v>

3550
02:37:29.690 --> 02:37:31.820
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We could still be friends and all that,</v>

3551
02:37:31.821 --> 02:37:35.200
<v Speaker 2>and then we could win something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>mattered and know this,</v>

3552
02:37:35.380 --> 02:37:38.930
<v Speaker 2>this political strategy will make </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone poor or sick or whatever.</v>

3553
02:37:39.080 --> 02:37:39.913
<v Speaker 2>Then We could be willing to change their</v>
<v Speaker 2>minds because in the end i think we've </v>

3554
02:37:42.441 --> 02:37:45.260
<v Speaker 2>got this evolved desire to latch on to </v>
<v Speaker 2>these things,</v>

3555
02:37:45.261 --> 02:37:50.261
<v Speaker 2>these ideas and values and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and products even and all that.</v>

3556
02:37:50.810 --> 02:37:51.643
<v Speaker 2>And so it'd be nice if we could do it </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the trivial and let the stuff that </v>

3557
02:37:54.681 --> 02:37:57.290
<v Speaker 2>really matters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guide rna by its accuracy.</v>

3558
02:37:57.350 --> 02:37:58.550
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be also nice if that.</v>

3559
02:37:58.670 --> 02:38:00.570
<v Speaker 2>The stuff that we do with trivial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3560
02:38:00.571 --> 02:38:03.810
<v Speaker 2>it stays actually trivial because </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so many people will,</v>

3561
02:38:03.950 --> 02:38:04.783
<v Speaker 2>I guess it goes with sports teams and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it also goes with like brands of </v>

3562
02:38:08.451 --> 02:38:10.910
<v Speaker 2>cars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I've heard people say,</v>

3563
02:38:10.920 --> 02:38:12.580
<v Speaker 2>I've always been a ford guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Love for.</v>

3564
02:38:12.600 --> 02:38:13.433
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3565
02:38:13.600 --> 02:38:15.380
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It probably reminds you of the ford your</v>

3566
02:38:15.381 --> 02:38:18.950
<v Speaker 2>dad drove or whatever I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's like I would never buy a chevy.</v>

3567
02:38:19.690 --> 02:38:22.130
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really never.</v>

3568
02:38:22.160 --> 02:38:23.080
<v Speaker 2>It's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

3569
02:38:23.081 --> 02:38:26.900
<v Speaker 2>If the best fucking car was a chevy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have the opportunity to buy it,</v>

3570
02:38:26.901 --> 02:38:27.350
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3571
02:38:27.350 --> 02:38:28.430
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a ford guy.</v>

3572
02:38:28.431 --> 02:38:29.240
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3573
02:38:29.240 --> 02:38:32.380
<v Speaker 2>What benefits?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's some strange reason.</v>

3574
02:38:32.720 --> 02:38:37.220
<v Speaker 2>There's some weird motivation to stick </v>
<v Speaker 2>to your initial statements.</v>

3575
02:38:37.390 --> 02:38:38.223
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I think it's like oliver wendell </v>

3576
02:38:39.291 --> 02:38:40.124
<v Speaker 2>holmes or someone who's had a foolish </v>
<v Speaker 2>consistency is the hoBgoblin of small </v>

3577
02:38:42.351 --> 02:38:43.184
<v Speaker 2>minds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3578
02:38:43.370 --> 02:38:47.240
<v Speaker 2>But we all have these consistencies </v>
<v Speaker 2>because part of the problem Is if I move</v>

3579
02:38:47.241 --> 02:38:49.040
<v Speaker 2>around with the wind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look at me as I'm a [inaudible],</v>

3580
02:38:49.150 --> 02:38:49.740
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3581
02:38:49.740 --> 02:38:52.910
<v Speaker 2>stand flop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I can't stand by what I believe in,</v>

3582
02:38:52.911 --> 02:38:54.920
<v Speaker 2>then you have no respect for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what if you.</v>

3583
02:38:55.190 --> 02:38:58.490
<v Speaker 2>What if you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you believe in is incorrect,</v>

3584
02:38:58.910 --> 02:39:00.990
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how you play into that.</v>

3585
02:39:02.110 --> 02:39:03.440
<v Speaker 2>That's where it gets real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3586
02:39:03.500 --> 02:39:05.830
<v Speaker 2>So what you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously what you ideally want is,</v>

3587
02:39:05.840 --> 02:39:08.870
<v Speaker 2>here's my value structure and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>unchangeable and then negotiable.</v>

3588
02:39:09.290 --> 02:39:10.123
<v Speaker 2>And yet when you show me that I'm in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that my attitudes are impeding my own </v>

3589
02:39:13.251 --> 02:39:14.084
<v Speaker 2>goals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I'm willing to change them to </v>

3590
02:39:14.961 --> 02:39:15.794
<v Speaker 2>achieve that value structure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think the best politicians and </v>

3591
02:39:18.681 --> 02:39:19.514
<v Speaker 2>scientists and artists and comedians and</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the rest of the ones who can do </v>

3592
02:39:22.671 --> 02:39:23.170
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3593
02:39:23.170 --> 02:39:24.410
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I like what you said.</v>

3594
02:39:24.411 --> 02:39:26.690
<v Speaker 2>Like here's my value structure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

3595
02:39:26.720 --> 02:39:28.550
<v Speaker 2>these are my ethics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are my morals,</v>

3596
02:39:28.551 --> 02:39:30.860
<v Speaker 2>this is how I treat people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is who I am.</v>

3597
02:39:31.250 --> 02:39:33.170
<v Speaker 2>But all that other stuff is just </v>
<v Speaker 2>information.</v>

3598
02:39:33.250 --> 02:39:35.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all a means to an end.</v>

3599
02:39:35.180 --> 02:39:37.490
<v Speaker 2>And so some people care a lot about </v>
<v Speaker 2>loyalty.</v>

3600
02:39:37.730 --> 02:39:38.563
<v Speaker 2>Other people care a lot about fairness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Other people care a lot about sanctity </v>

3601
02:39:41.571 --> 02:39:42.201
<v Speaker 2>and purity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3602
02:39:42.201 --> 02:39:43.640
<v Speaker 2>There's different values that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>

3603
02:39:43.641 --> 02:39:45.050
<v Speaker 2>All of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all care about them,</v>

3604
02:39:45.260 --> 02:39:48.530
<v Speaker 2>but some people wait one set more </v>
<v Speaker 2>important more than another set.</v>

3605
02:39:48.830 --> 02:39:49.640
<v Speaker 2>John hyde,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you.</v>

3606
02:39:49.640 --> 02:39:50.960
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you've had him on your </v>
<v Speaker 2>show,</v>

3607
02:39:51.410 --> 02:39:52.243
<v Speaker 2>he does this work and he's one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first people that push these ideas and </v>

3608
02:39:54.951 --> 02:39:57.350
<v Speaker 2>you can predict them by people's </v>
<v Speaker 2>politics and stuff like that.</v>

3609
02:39:57.620 --> 02:40:00.350
<v Speaker 2>And so if we all agree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they all matter,</v>

3610
02:40:00.380 --> 02:40:01.213
<v Speaker 2>but the problem is then we get into an </v>
<v Speaker 2>argument where you tell me loyalty is </v>

3611
02:40:03.531 --> 02:40:06.950
<v Speaker 2>more important than I tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fairness or harm is really important and</v>

3612
02:40:06.951 --> 02:40:09.970
<v Speaker 2>then we're never going to see eye to eye</v>
<v Speaker 2>and probabilities,</v>

3613
02:40:10.010 --> 02:40:12.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with two humans that are healthy.</v>

3614
02:40:12.990 --> 02:40:14.310
<v Speaker 2>That's an interesting discussion</v>

3615
02:40:14.310 --> 02:40:15.143
<v Speaker 1>because why do you think fairness is </v>
<v Speaker 1>more important and why do I think </v>

3616
02:40:17.460 --> 02:40:20.610
<v Speaker 1>discipline is more important than </v>
<v Speaker 1>fairness or education is more,</v>

3617
02:40:20.611 --> 02:40:24.630
<v Speaker 1>or whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that when someone clings to this</v>

3618
02:40:24.631 --> 02:40:28.140
<v Speaker 1>idea that this is the most significant </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspect of human civilization,</v>

3619
02:40:28.141 --> 02:40:28.974
<v Speaker 1>that's always weird and it's hard when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't acknowledge other </v>

3620
02:40:31.081 --> 02:40:32.370
<v Speaker 1>possibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3621
02:40:32.550 --> 02:40:33.510
<v Speaker 1>And some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>

3622
02:40:33.570 --> 02:40:35.010
<v Speaker 1>all of these things are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate to say it,</v>

3623
02:40:35.011 --> 02:40:36.480
<v Speaker 1>but they're like 50 percent genetic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3624
02:40:36.570 --> 02:40:40.710
<v Speaker 1>Some of us are more openminded and some </v>
<v Speaker 1>of us are more closed minded and there's</v>

3625
02:40:40.711 --> 02:40:43.680
<v Speaker 1>probably good reasons to be that way </v>
<v Speaker 1>that made your,</v>

3626
02:40:44.100 --> 02:40:46.980
<v Speaker 1>that made you successful under one set </v>
<v Speaker 1>of circumstances versus another.</v>

3627
02:40:46.981 --> 02:40:48.270
<v Speaker 1>Because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extroversion,</v>

3628
02:40:48.300 --> 02:40:49.133
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost all people prefer extroverts or </v>

3629
02:40:51.450 --> 02:40:52.283
<v Speaker 1>introverts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but extroverts are all sorts of risks </v>

3630
02:40:53.821 --> 02:40:54.654
<v Speaker 1>for disease because they're constantly </v>
<v Speaker 1>up in everyone's face and so an </v>

3631
02:40:56.851 --> 02:40:57.684
<v Speaker 1>ancestral environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was probably pretty costly to be </v>

3632
02:40:59.281 --> 02:41:00.114
<v Speaker 1>extroverted and you paid a price in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>introverts didn't have to pay when you </v>

3633
02:41:02.971 --> 02:41:03.804
<v Speaker 1>got sick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also like we gained so much </v>

3634
02:41:05.371 --> 02:41:07.770
<v Speaker 1>creativity and insight from introverts </v>
<v Speaker 1>course.</v>

3635
02:41:07.830 --> 02:41:08.170
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

3636
02:41:08.170 --> 02:41:09.600
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at a social level,</v>

3637
02:41:09.601 --> 02:41:10.434
<v Speaker 1>extroverts benefit introverts might </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefit by then running microsoft and </v>

3638
02:41:12.841 --> 02:41:15.120
<v Speaker 1>being the greatest artist and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's again,</v>

3639
02:41:15.440 --> 02:41:18.060
<v Speaker 1>as we talked about this earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the beauty about being human is how many</v>

3640
02:41:18.061 --> 02:41:20.040
<v Speaker 1>different ways you can achieve the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>goal.</v>

3641
02:41:20.750 --> 02:41:23.400
<v Speaker 1>What are your thoughts on the influence </v>
<v Speaker 1>of epigenetics?</v>

3642
02:41:23.910 --> 02:41:25.900
<v Speaker 1>Look at super interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my,</v>

3643
02:41:25.930 --> 02:41:27.620
<v Speaker 1>my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know little about it,</v>

3644
02:41:27.750 --> 02:41:28.583
<v Speaker 1>very little about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My behavioral genetics colleague insist </v>

3645
02:41:30.711 --> 02:41:31.544
<v Speaker 1>that there's no good evidence among </v>
<v Speaker 1>humans for multigenerational epigenetic </v>

3646
02:41:34.471 --> 02:41:35.304
<v Speaker 1>effects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know that they exist now in some </v>

3647
02:41:36.901 --> 02:41:37.734
<v Speaker 1>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can do the experiments pretty easily </v>

3648
02:41:39.630 --> 02:41:42.750
<v Speaker 1>to get these multigenerational epigenic </v>
<v Speaker 1>epigenetic effect.</v>

3649
02:41:42.751 --> 02:41:43.980
<v Speaker 1>Explain to people what we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

3650
02:41:44.010 --> 02:41:47.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So epigenetics is basically you can turn</v>

3651
02:41:47.371 --> 02:41:48.204
<v Speaker 1>genes on and off in the simplest sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so environmental factors will </v>

3652
02:41:51.211 --> 02:41:52.044
<v Speaker 1>matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like maybe when you're in utero there's </v>

3653
02:41:53.400 --> 02:41:55.710
<v Speaker 1>a famine and that's a common thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's looked at.</v>

3654
02:41:55.710 --> 02:41:57.690
<v Speaker 1>We'll look at that in rats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

3655
02:41:57.691 --> 02:41:58.524
<v Speaker 1>will underfeed the mother when the </v>
<v Speaker 1>baby's in there and that causes the </v>

3656
02:42:01.630 --> 02:42:02.463
<v Speaker 1>baby's methylation of some of the jeans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand the science of it at </v>

3657
02:42:05.581 --> 02:42:06.414
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the turn some jeans on and some </v>

3658
02:42:07.891 --> 02:42:12.840
<v Speaker 1>jeans off and so a baby of a of a mother</v>
<v Speaker 1>rat who was raised who is in utero,</v>

3659
02:42:12.841 --> 02:42:16.350
<v Speaker 1>when the mother was underfed will mature</v>
<v Speaker 1>more rapidly.</v>

3660
02:42:16.351 --> 02:42:17.184
<v Speaker 1>It'll eat everything that's not nailed </v>
<v Speaker 1>down and it'll have sex with lots more </v>

3661
02:42:19.741 --> 02:42:21.810
<v Speaker 1>rats than unregular than a rat that </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't,</v>

3662
02:42:21.960 --> 02:42:22.481
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't have it.</v>

3663
02:42:22.481 --> 02:42:23.314
<v Speaker 1>Some other starved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the key thing is that makes good </v>

3664
02:42:25.291 --> 02:42:27.210
<v Speaker 1>sense because it's a way to respond to </v>
<v Speaker 1>times of famine.</v>

3665
02:42:27.390 --> 02:42:28.223
<v Speaker 1>Grow as fast as you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reproduce as quickly as you can because </v>

3666
02:42:30.361 --> 02:42:32.280
<v Speaker 1>you know reproductions of currency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of evolution,</v>

3667
02:42:32.460 --> 02:42:34.320
<v Speaker 1>the fact that you exist and live is </v>
<v Speaker 1>trivial.</v>

3668
02:42:34.440 --> 02:42:37.590
<v Speaker 1>The fact that you passed on your genes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what evolution works with,</v>

3669
02:42:38.100 --> 02:42:38.933
<v Speaker 1>so it's a great way to change with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>local environment and there's some very </v>

3670
02:42:43.051 --> 02:42:46.140
<v Speaker 1>interesting evidence that then those </v>
<v Speaker 1>effects are even in the next generation,</v>

3671
02:42:46.141 --> 02:42:50.070
<v Speaker 1>so the child of a rat that was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was in a mother who was underfed.</v>

3672
02:42:50.310 --> 02:42:52.410
<v Speaker 1>We'll also have some of these strategies</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

3673
02:42:52.411 --> 02:42:54.040
<v Speaker 1>believe they find that in humans as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

3674
02:42:54.041 --> 02:42:56.520
<v Speaker 1>We all have suffered from famine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the argument,</v>

3675
02:42:56.700 --> 02:42:57.533
<v Speaker 1>but none of the data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My behavioral genetics colleagues says </v>

3676
02:42:58.981 --> 02:43:01.620
<v Speaker 1>none of those data are robust enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of like some of the criticisms</v>

3677
02:43:01.621 --> 02:43:03.090
<v Speaker 1>you made of what I've said and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

3678
02:43:03.270 --> 02:43:04.103
<v Speaker 1>the data suggests things that might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's lots of alternative </v>

3679
02:43:06.540 --> 02:43:07.373
<v Speaker 1>explanations so we don't yet know it </v>
<v Speaker 1>will get read as about longevity and </v>

3680
02:43:11.170 --> 02:43:12.010
<v Speaker 1>that there was some sort</v>

3681
02:43:12.010 --> 02:43:12.843
<v Speaker 2>of evidence that points to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>descendants of people who survived </v>

3682
02:43:16.301 --> 02:43:17.770
<v Speaker 2>famine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

3683
02:43:17.960 --> 02:43:19.870
<v Speaker 2>they live longer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3684
02:43:19.871 --> 02:43:23.530
<v Speaker 2>And so the question might be why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we know,</v>

3685
02:43:23.531 --> 02:43:25.720
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that if you're in utero,</v>

3686
02:43:25.721 --> 02:43:29.020
<v Speaker 2>during famine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>males are more likely to be aborted than</v>

3687
02:43:29.021 --> 02:43:30.490
<v Speaker 2>females.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When it gets really bad,</v>

3688
02:43:31.390 --> 02:43:34.780
<v Speaker 2>female fetuses are probably more robust,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you ignore that gender effect,</v>

3689
02:43:34.960 --> 02:43:35.793
<v Speaker 2>in all probability,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those fetuses that could survive in a </v>

3690
02:43:37.841 --> 02:43:40.840
<v Speaker 2>mother during feminine might just be the</v>
<v Speaker 2>more robust specimens.</v>

3691
02:43:40.841 --> 02:43:43.030
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so you might just be calling out the</v>

3692
02:43:43.031 --> 02:43:46.010
<v Speaker 2>people who wouldn't have lived as long </v>
<v Speaker 2>and so it's super hard to,</v>

3693
02:43:46.020 --> 02:43:47.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't do experiments on these things</v>

3694
02:43:47.921 --> 02:43:48.754
<v Speaker 2>in humans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can do experiments in mice and rats </v>

3695
02:43:50.781 --> 02:43:52.540
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and try to find these things out.</v>

3696
02:43:52.541 --> 02:43:53.920
<v Speaker 2>The downside is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3697
02:43:54.010 --> 02:43:54.843
<v Speaker 2>if you've read about a million cancer </v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs that are really going to help us </v>

3698
02:43:56.921 --> 02:43:57.700
<v Speaker 2>and then they disappear.</v>

3699
02:43:57.700 --> 02:44:00.580
<v Speaker 2>It's because it works in a mouse and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't work in us.</v>

3700
02:44:01.060 --> 02:44:04.930
<v Speaker 2>And the downside of these things is even</v>
<v Speaker 2>mice and rats differ from each other and</v>

3701
02:44:04.931 --> 02:44:07.150
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're a long way from either of them</v>

3702
02:44:07.151 --> 02:44:09.490
<v Speaker 2>and so the epigenetic effects,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did they show?</v>

3703
02:44:09.491 --> 02:44:12.070
<v Speaker 2>There may be good reasons why we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3704
02:44:12.490 --> 02:44:13.323
<v Speaker 2>there's some real ethical questions in </v>
<v Speaker 2>regard to running studies like that on </v>

3705
02:44:17.951 --> 02:44:19.420
<v Speaker 2>human being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

3706
02:44:19.570 --> 02:44:23.740
<v Speaker 2>We're going to have to develop headless </v>
<v Speaker 2>humans in a lab that have no soul,</v>

3707
02:44:23.860 --> 02:44:24.693
<v Speaker 2>that we could do tests on what we could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I actually think that what will get </v>

3708
02:44:27.881 --> 02:44:31.330
<v Speaker 2>really good at is the issue you raised </v>
<v Speaker 2>earlier and that is,</v>

3709
02:44:31.480 --> 02:44:33.370
<v Speaker 2>I don't know everything that's ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened to you,</v>

3710
02:44:33.460 --> 02:44:34.293
<v Speaker 2>but some day it'll be possible to know a</v>
<v Speaker 2>ton of that stuff and I'll be able to </v>

3711
02:44:37.181 --> 02:44:40.870
<v Speaker 2>rule out all sorts of alternative causes</v>
<v Speaker 2>and diet is a perfect example.</v>

3712
02:44:40.870 --> 02:44:42.400
<v Speaker 2>You guys talk about that a lot on this </v>
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>

3713
02:44:42.401 --> 02:44:43.234
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do we know that this particular </v>

3714
02:44:44.500 --> 02:44:46.300
<v Speaker 2>collection of foods will actually do you</v>
<v Speaker 2>any good?</v>

3715
02:44:46.301 --> 02:44:47.950
<v Speaker 2>How do we know how well people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>sticking to it?</v>

3716
02:44:48.280 --> 02:44:51.310
<v Speaker 2>And a big part of those effects are </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually the psychological effects.</v>

3717
02:44:51.311 --> 02:44:53.910
<v Speaker 2>So protein is a really good example that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3718
02:44:53.950 --> 02:44:57.880
<v Speaker 2>steve simpson argued in the early </v>
<v Speaker 2>nineties that if you started with locus,</v>

3719
02:44:58.030 --> 02:44:58.863
<v Speaker 2>that animals are motivated to eat as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>function of how much protein that </v>

3720
02:45:01.331 --> 02:45:02.164
<v Speaker 2>they've consumed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the atkins diet was the right </v>

3721
02:45:04.481 --> 02:45:06.880
<v Speaker 2>idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a misunderstanding of the cause.</v>

3722
02:45:07.060 --> 02:45:09.100
<v Speaker 2>It's just the protein.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We evolved to feel full.</v>

3723
02:45:09.101 --> 02:45:09.934
<v Speaker 2>When you get protein,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we didn't evolve to feel full from </v>

3724
02:45:11.291 --> 02:45:12.124
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrates and there's a host of </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasons for that and there's a host of </v>

3725
02:45:13.781 --> 02:45:15.340
<v Speaker 2>other effects that are going on at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same time,</v>

3726
02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:19.090
<v Speaker 2>but the consequence of that is then when</v>
<v Speaker 2>people's diets move around,</v>

3727
02:45:19.300 --> 02:45:19.871
<v Speaker 2>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh look,</v>

3728
02:45:19.871 --> 02:45:21.490
<v Speaker 2>this diet is this affecting that one </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't,</v>

3729
02:45:21.491 --> 02:45:24.400
<v Speaker 2>but you don't actually know what they've</v>
<v Speaker 2>been doing because some diets are harder</v>

3730
02:45:24.401 --> 02:45:26.260
<v Speaker 2>to maintain and they're cheating more </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

3731
02:45:26.800 --> 02:45:29.590
<v Speaker 2>Someday we'll have much better evidence </v>
<v Speaker 2>and all of that.</v>

3732
02:45:29.591 --> 02:45:31.800
<v Speaker 2>You'll be wearing a device.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll know what you consumed.</v>

3733
02:45:31.801 --> 02:45:33.640
<v Speaker 2>I'll know which aisle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an accelerometer on the wall,</v>

3734
02:45:33.641 --> 02:45:35.320
<v Speaker 2>everything that happened to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3735
02:45:35.321 --> 02:45:37.120
<v Speaker 2>that's another interesting aspect of </v>
<v Speaker 2>genetics,</v>

3736
02:45:37.121 --> 02:45:37.954
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's one thing that we absolutely </v>

3737
02:45:38.771 --> 02:45:42.010
<v Speaker 2>knows that some people respond </v>
<v Speaker 2>differently to doris and other people do</v>

3738
02:45:42.340 --> 02:45:43.173
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for some person a particular type of </v>

3739
02:45:45.461 --> 02:45:49.230
<v Speaker 2>diet is beneficial and perfect and just </v>
<v Speaker 2>locked in and other person.</v>

3740
02:45:49.231 --> 02:45:50.240
<v Speaker 2>That'd be horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3741
02:45:50.350 --> 02:45:51.610
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's weird.</v>

3742
02:45:51.860 --> 02:45:55.420
<v Speaker 2>You kNow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>across the species I find that with dogs</v>

3743
02:45:55.421 --> 02:45:57.140
<v Speaker 2>or.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it it at an ethnic level.</v>

3744
02:45:57.141 --> 02:45:57.974
<v Speaker 2>That makes perfect sense because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who have been eating different </v>

3745
02:45:59.471 --> 02:46:00.304
<v Speaker 2>foods for a long period of time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to adapt to that and of course </v>

3746
02:46:03.700 --> 02:46:06.310
<v Speaker 2>agriculture is only 12,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years old total,</v>

3747
02:46:06.610 --> 02:46:08.920
<v Speaker 2>although we've been eating cereals </v>
<v Speaker 2>before that in lots of.</v>

3748
02:46:09.500 --> 02:46:13.640
<v Speaker 2>Didn't have it at all or only had it </v>
<v Speaker 2>very recently and so it's super hard for</v>

3749
02:46:13.641 --> 02:46:17.370
<v Speaker 2>some people eat grains compared to other</v>
<v Speaker 2>people to eat grains because they're.</v>

3750
02:46:17.420 --> 02:46:18.253
<v Speaker 2>They haven't adapted either diabetes </v>
<v Speaker 2>wise or all the other kinds of things </v>

3751
02:46:20.601 --> 02:46:23.240
<v Speaker 2>that it can cause it to go wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Certainly with alcohol,</v>

3752
02:46:23.241 --> 02:46:24.620
<v Speaker 2>that's a giant fan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

3753
02:46:24.621 --> 02:46:25.454
<v Speaker 2>And alcohol gets invented every time </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone invents agriculture because all </v>

3754
02:46:27.621 --> 02:46:29.930
<v Speaker 2>you do is you accidentally leave it </v>
<v Speaker 2>there too long and it ferments.</v>

3755
02:46:29.990 --> 02:46:30.823
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there's an argument that we </v>

3756
02:46:32.751 --> 02:46:33.584
<v Speaker 2>actually evolved to have a tolerance for</v>
<v Speaker 2>beer rather than a taste for it because </v>

3757
02:46:37.491 --> 02:46:41.030
<v Speaker 2>once we're in early agricultural </v>
<v Speaker 2>settlements for the first time ever were</v>

3758
02:46:41.031 --> 02:46:43.250
<v Speaker 2>crapping where we're drinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not moving on.</v>

3759
02:46:43.430 --> 02:46:44.263
<v Speaker 2>And so we found our own drinking water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so beers literally safer to drink than </v>

3760
02:46:46.731 --> 02:46:48.350
<v Speaker 2>water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>low beer and wine,</v>

3761
02:46:48.351 --> 02:46:49.184
<v Speaker 2>low grade alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what the data said suggest what </v>

3762
02:46:51.981 --> 02:46:55.610
<v Speaker 2>people argue is that we evolved to </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually have a taste for it,</v>

3763
02:46:55.611 --> 02:46:56.444
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but tolerance to it rather than a </v>

3764
02:46:57.531 --> 02:46:58.070
<v Speaker 2>distaste for.</v>

3765
02:46:58.070 --> 02:47:01.010
<v Speaker 2>Which makes sense evolutionarily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Getting drunk with hippos running around</v>

3766
02:47:01.150 --> 02:47:02.600
<v Speaker 2>you can't be a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>

3767
02:47:02.601 --> 02:47:03.434
<v Speaker 2>if you think about wine or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or any booze the first time you drink </v>

3768
02:47:06.451 --> 02:47:07.284
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's discussed.</v>

3769
02:47:07.430 --> 02:47:09.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to develop a taste for it.</v>

3770
02:47:09.591 --> 02:47:10.730
<v Speaker 2>It's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

3771
02:47:10.910 --> 02:47:12.350
<v Speaker 2>and lots of things that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that way tabasco,</v>

3772
02:47:12.351 --> 02:47:13.184
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lots of these spices have antibacterial </v>

3773
02:47:14.541 --> 02:47:17.450
<v Speaker 2>effects so the mothers are given it to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The kids were like,</v>

3774
02:47:17.451 --> 02:47:18.284
<v Speaker 2>on my mouth would be on fire if I want </v>
<v Speaker 2>some six year old canadian India or </v>

3775
02:47:20.451 --> 02:47:23.930
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Initially why they added sabi to sushi.</v>

3776
02:47:23.960 --> 02:47:25.880
<v Speaker 2>That's what a lot of people argue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in fact,</v>

3777
02:47:25.881 --> 02:47:27.860
<v Speaker 2>as you work your way from the pole to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the equator,</v>

3778
02:47:27.861 --> 02:47:28.694
<v Speaker 2>you get more and more spices because of </v>
<v Speaker 2>course in Sweden there's six pathogens </v>

3779
02:47:31.370 --> 02:47:35.180
<v Speaker 2>and you've got salt and pepper in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>jungle and then africa,</v>

3780
02:47:35.190 --> 02:47:37.130
<v Speaker 2>you've got to get zillion spices,</v>
<v Speaker 2>garlic,</v>

3781
02:47:37.131 --> 02:47:38.600
<v Speaker 2>all of these things are super powerful.</v>

3782
02:47:38.600 --> 02:47:39.680
<v Speaker 2>Antibacterials,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3783
02:47:39.710 --> 02:47:42.050
<v Speaker 2>that is a really interesting way of </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at it.</v>

3784
02:47:42.051 --> 02:47:43.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>

3785
02:47:43.521 --> 02:47:45.020
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Mexico,</v>

3786
02:47:45.021 --> 02:47:47.690
<v Speaker 2>very hot and spicy food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Warm climate.</v>

3787
02:47:48.110 --> 02:47:49.520
<v Speaker 2>Totally make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3788
02:47:49.540 --> 02:47:50.373
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the same thing happens with the </v>

3789
02:47:51.830 --> 02:47:55.070
<v Speaker 2>profusion of religions and languages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The closer you get to the equator,</v>

3790
02:47:55.071 --> 02:47:57.080
<v Speaker 2>the more languages you out in the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>religions,</v>

3791
02:47:57.081 --> 02:47:58.700
<v Speaker 2>yet because people start saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3792
02:47:58.701 --> 02:48:01.130
<v Speaker 2>on the other side of the valley,</v>
<v Speaker 2>literally you could have a pathogen that</v>

3793
02:48:01.131 --> 02:48:01.964
<v Speaker 2>makes me sick and so I'm going to stay </v>
<v Speaker 2>away from you and by staying away from </v>

3794
02:48:04.071 --> 02:48:04.904
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Over time we developed different </v>

3795
02:48:05.331 --> 02:48:06.650
<v Speaker 2>languages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>different religions.</v>

3796
02:48:06.860 --> 02:48:07.970
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back to Sweden,</v>

3797
02:48:08.150 --> 02:48:09.200
<v Speaker 2>whatever you got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got.</v>

3798
02:48:09.201 --> 02:48:10.470
<v Speaker 2>There's three things to have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3799
02:48:10.760 --> 02:48:13.340
<v Speaker 2>And so you're not a risk to me and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>share the same language.</v>

3800
02:48:13.341 --> 02:48:14.174
<v Speaker 2>We intermingle much more readily and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's more ethnocentrism is you go </v>

3801
02:48:16.521 --> 02:48:17.540
<v Speaker 2>close to the equator.</v>

3802
02:48:17.780 --> 02:48:18.613
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To keep keeping apart makes good </v>

3803
02:48:20.601 --> 02:48:22.700
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary sense under those </v>
<v Speaker 2>circumstances,</v>

3804
02:48:22.820 --> 02:48:24.950
<v Speaker 2>but we live in a world where no one's </v>
<v Speaker 2>keeping apart.</v>

3805
02:48:25.340 --> 02:48:27.020
<v Speaker 2>Now we live in a world where it makes it</v>
<v Speaker 2>much,</v>

3806
02:48:27.021 --> 02:48:29.510
<v Speaker 2>much more difficult and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessarily least in our,</v>

3807
02:48:29.830 --> 02:48:30.663
<v Speaker 2>in our blessitt industrialized </v>
<v Speaker 2>democracies where we've got good </v>

3808
02:48:32.091 --> 02:48:33.380
<v Speaker 2>medicines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least for now,</v>

3809
02:48:33.381 --> 02:48:35.390
<v Speaker 2>they still work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't need to anymore.</v>

3810
02:48:35.570 --> 02:48:36.403
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we also have these crazy factory </v>

3811
02:48:39.921 --> 02:48:40.754
<v Speaker 2>farming setups that lead to the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>horrible super bugs that could kill a </v>

3812
02:48:45.860 --> 02:48:47.110
<v Speaker 2>million people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We did it.</v>

3813
02:48:47.310 --> 02:48:51.140
<v Speaker 2>I remember when I first found that out </v>
<v Speaker 2>that most of the major flus,</v>

3814
02:48:51.141 --> 02:48:52.940
<v Speaker 2>like avian flu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>swine flu,</v>

3815
02:48:53.090 --> 02:48:55.250
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know why they were calling it </v>
<v Speaker 2>the swine flu.</v>

3816
02:48:55.610 --> 02:48:56.443
<v Speaker 2>And then I found that no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's from domesticated pigs and it's </v>

3817
02:48:58.630 --> 02:49:01.580
<v Speaker 2>somehow more of some jumps to humans and</v>
<v Speaker 2>why.</v>

3818
02:49:01.581 --> 02:49:03.740
<v Speaker 2>And that was the cost we paid with </v>
<v Speaker 2>agriculture.</v>

3819
02:49:04.010 --> 02:49:05.540
<v Speaker 2>so the first time we were starting to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get.</v>

3820
02:49:05.680 --> 02:49:08.760
<v Speaker 2>We're a cheek by jowl with a bunch </v>
<v Speaker 2>animals and agriculture.</v>

3821
02:49:08.761 --> 02:49:10.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean hunter gatherers eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

3822
02:49:10.070 --> 02:49:12.180
<v Speaker 2>the animal never lives long enough to </v>
<v Speaker 2>give you the flu.</v>

3823
02:49:12.270 --> 02:49:13.650
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

3824
02:49:13.740 --> 02:49:14.700
<v Speaker 2>So everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3825
02:49:14.730 --> 02:49:19.260
<v Speaker 2>there's always pluses and minuses when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you change how you do things and we,</v>

3826
02:49:19.261 --> 02:49:20.094
<v Speaker 2>you and I are really lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We live in a time where all these great </v>

3827
02:49:22.081 --> 02:49:22.914
<v Speaker 2>medicines exist in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they haven't become worthless yet and </v>

3828
02:49:24.751 --> 02:49:25.584
<v Speaker 2>now it's really a race against the </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolution of the bacteria and devising </v>

3829
02:49:29.611 --> 02:49:30.444
<v Speaker 2>new medicines that can continue to </v>
<v Speaker 2>defeat them because everything's </v>

3830
02:49:32.550 --> 02:49:34.320
<v Speaker 2>becoming treatment resistant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3831
02:49:34.321 --> 02:49:37.740
<v Speaker 2>That's how evolution works and and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just starting to happen.</v>

3832
02:49:37.741 --> 02:49:38.574
<v Speaker 2>And so now scientists have to work </v>
<v Speaker 2>double time to keep inventing new drugs </v>

3833
02:49:41.341 --> 02:49:42.174
<v Speaker 2>to stay ahead of the game with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>exception of some things that just for </v>

3834
02:49:44.611 --> 02:49:46.860
<v Speaker 2>whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bacteria don't seem to be able to evolve</v>

3835
02:49:46.861 --> 02:49:47.880
<v Speaker 2>resistance to them.</v>

3836
02:49:48.240 --> 02:49:49.073
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's fascinating to me is not just </v>

3837
02:49:50.341 --> 02:49:51.174
<v Speaker 2>scientists creating these vaccines and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all these different medicines to deal </v>

3838
02:49:53.731 --> 02:49:54.564
<v Speaker 2>with these diseases,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the potential of shutting off genes </v>

3839
02:49:58.270 --> 02:49:59.103
<v Speaker 2>that potential of altering the human </v>
<v Speaker 2>genome and using things like whatever </v>

3840
02:50:02.671 --> 02:50:06.000
<v Speaker 2>the future version of crispr is going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be to.</v>

3841
02:50:06.180 --> 02:50:10.080
<v Speaker 2>I mean they've already figured out a way</v>
<v Speaker 2>to stop certain diseases.</v>

3842
02:50:10.110 --> 02:50:10.943
<v Speaker 2>So those single gene things are great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember with everything being so </v>

3843
02:50:14.191 --> 02:50:15.024
<v Speaker 2>apologetic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't just want to shut shit down </v>

3844
02:50:16.201 --> 02:50:18.680
<v Speaker 2>willy nilly and so then really what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're at,</v>

3845
02:50:18.690 --> 02:50:20.640
<v Speaker 2>the advantages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the point you made earlier.</v>

3846
02:50:20.641 --> 02:50:21.474
<v Speaker 2>So my diet should be 60 percent protein </v>
<v Speaker 2>in your should be 15 percent or mindset </v>

3847
02:50:25.961 --> 02:50:27.840
<v Speaker 2>or more leafy vegetables in euros,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

3848
02:50:27.930 --> 02:50:28.763
<v Speaker 2>and we'll be able to know that we'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>know how my guts going to respond to it </v>

3849
02:50:31.141 --> 02:50:31.974
<v Speaker 2>and how you're gonna respond to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's one of the things that 23 </v>

3850
02:50:34.021 --> 02:50:35.160
<v Speaker 2>and me actually does.</v>

3851
02:50:35.160 --> 02:50:35.993
<v Speaker 2>They do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do show like what foods you'd be </v>

3852
02:50:37.861 --> 02:50:38.694
<v Speaker 2>more likely to be allergic to and what </v>
<v Speaker 2>things would be most likely to be </v>

3853
02:50:42.121 --> 02:50:42.954
<v Speaker 2>attracted and that's a great start.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what we really need is apologetic </v>

3854
02:50:45.020 --> 02:50:47.520
<v Speaker 2>scores that tell you how do you process </v>
<v Speaker 2>leafy vegetables,</v>

3855
02:50:47.521 --> 02:50:49.860
<v Speaker 2>how do you process fats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you process all that stuff?</v>

3856
02:50:50.520 --> 02:50:54.030
<v Speaker 2>And so because you knowj,</v>
<v Speaker 2>genes account for most of our weight,</v>

3857
02:50:54.031 --> 02:50:56.700
<v Speaker 2>that's most of the variance in our </v>
<v Speaker 2>weather or obese or not,</v>

3858
02:50:56.880 --> 02:51:00.610
<v Speaker 2>but nobody was obese when you and our </v>
<v Speaker 2>kids have.</v>

3859
02:51:00.870 --> 02:51:01.703
<v Speaker 2>Tons of people are obese now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what those genes really are is genes </v>

3860
02:51:03.991 --> 02:51:06.620
<v Speaker 2>to sensitivity to something changing in </v>
<v Speaker 2>our environment.</v>

3861
02:51:06.621 --> 02:51:07.454
<v Speaker 2>Either activity levels of the foods </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're eating or how process they are or </v>

3862
02:51:09.751 --> 02:51:12.000
<v Speaker 2>how much carbs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever we don't know.</v>

3863
02:51:12.180 --> 02:51:13.013
<v Speaker 2>But that's what we're actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>genetically sensitive to it because all </v>

3864
02:51:15.301 --> 02:51:16.890
<v Speaker 2>of us have the same underlying problem.</v>

3865
02:51:16.890 --> 02:51:17.723
<v Speaker 2>That evolution didn't really worry about</v>
<v Speaker 2>obesity because the problem was the </v>

3866
02:51:19.981 --> 02:51:23.580
<v Speaker 2>opposite starving and so we were not </v>
<v Speaker 2>really good at telling when we're full.</v>

3867
02:51:23.850 --> 02:51:26.670
<v Speaker 2>ANd there's interesting evidence that </v>
<v Speaker 2>suggests some really lovely studies that</v>

3868
02:51:26.671 --> 02:51:30.000
<v Speaker 2>show that really one of the key guides </v>
<v Speaker 2>of appetite was variety.</v>

3869
02:51:30.480 --> 02:51:32.310
<v Speaker 2>When you eat a lot less variety,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're.</v>

3870
02:51:32.311 --> 02:51:35.190
<v Speaker 2>That's when your stomach tells you </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're full really much more reliably.</v>

3871
02:51:35.400 --> 02:51:36.233
<v Speaker 2>But as you add variety to your diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which everybody on earth can do now </v>

3872
02:51:38.220 --> 02:51:39.053
<v Speaker 2>while everybody's got any money on earth</v>
<v Speaker 2>can do now that actually you short </v>

3873
02:51:41.911 --> 02:51:44.460
<v Speaker 2>circuit the best mechanism we had to </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell us to stop eating.</v>

3874
02:51:44.940 --> 02:51:45.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's interesting.</v>

3875
02:51:45.871 --> 02:51:50.590
<v Speaker 2>And now as an argument that people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>are experts on nutrition are,</v>

3876
02:51:50.591 --> 02:51:54.960
<v Speaker 2>are making about one of the more recent </v>
<v Speaker 2>diet plans that people are using.</v>

3877
02:51:55.140 --> 02:51:55.973
<v Speaker 2>The carnivore diet is that just eating </v>
<v Speaker 2>only meat and there's a lot of people </v>

3878
02:52:00.661 --> 02:52:01.494
<v Speaker 2>that are doing that and they're finding </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're having all these like </v>

3879
02:52:04.350 --> 02:52:06.340
<v Speaker 2>really rapid decreases</v>

3880
02:52:06.340 --> 02:52:07.173
<v Speaker 3>in autoimmune diseases and rapid </v>
<v Speaker 3>recoveries from eczema and siberia and </v>

3881
02:52:13.370 --> 02:52:18.070
<v Speaker 3>I'll psoriasis and the people that are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people are saying,</v>

3882
02:52:18.100 --> 02:52:18.851
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the meat.</v>

3883
02:52:18.851 --> 02:52:19.684
<v Speaker 3>Meat's great for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's great for her and some nutrition </v>

3884
02:52:22.121 --> 02:52:27.121
<v Speaker 3>experts saying more likely this is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>calorie like you're,</v>

3885
02:52:28.010 --> 02:52:28.843
<v Speaker 3>you're at a calorie deficit and by </v>
<v Speaker 3>putting your body into a calorie </v>

3886
02:52:31.721 --> 02:52:32.880
<v Speaker 3>deficit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're almost like in a,</v>

3887
02:52:32.881 --> 02:52:33.714
<v Speaker 3>in a state of fasting and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>decreasing your body weight because </v>

3888
02:52:36.041 --> 02:52:36.874
<v Speaker 3>almost universally all these people that</v>
<v Speaker 3>are that are talking about the positive </v>

3889
02:52:40.031 --> 02:52:42.550
<v Speaker 3>benefits of these diets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these elimination diets,</v>

3890
02:52:42.551 --> 02:52:43.384
<v Speaker 3>and just eating one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that they're showing </v>

3891
02:52:45.041 --> 02:52:45.340
<v Speaker 3>us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they.</v>

3892
02:52:45.340 --> 02:52:46.420
<v Speaker 3>They lose a shitload of weight.</v>

3893
02:52:46.530 --> 02:52:47.363
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the thing is that I suspect </v>

3894
02:52:48.181 --> 02:52:49.650
<v Speaker 1>you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that either they're cutting out what for</v>

3895
02:52:49.651 --> 02:52:52.200
<v Speaker 1>them is the perpetrator and who would </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever know out of the 4,000</v>

3896
02:52:52.201 --> 02:52:53.034
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3897
02:52:53.250 --> 02:52:54.083
<v Speaker 1>Or it's literally the losing weight and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then hopefully they're taking </v>

3898
02:52:56.641 --> 02:52:58.920
<v Speaker 1>multivitamins to make it for all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff that they're not getting.</v>

3899
02:52:58.921 --> 02:52:59.391
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3900
02:52:59.391 --> 02:53:00.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they are.</v>

3901
02:53:00.910 --> 02:53:03.760
<v Speaker 3>A lot of them are not doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really interesting.</v>

3902
02:53:04.150 --> 02:53:04.983
<v Speaker 3>I've been following it pretty closely </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I've had quite a few people on the </v>

3903
02:53:06.821 --> 02:53:09.580
<v Speaker 3>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>including really intelligent guys.</v>

3904
02:53:09.581 --> 02:53:11.470
<v Speaker 3>Like Jordan Peterson is on this.</v>

3905
02:53:11.660 --> 02:53:13.060
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he does he and salt.</v>

3906
02:53:13.070 --> 02:53:14.330
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for me that wouldn't work.</v>

3907
02:53:14.331 --> 02:53:15.120
<v Speaker 1>Although I am,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3908
02:53:15.120 --> 02:53:19.400
<v Speaker 1>I meet in fruit basically and then very </v>
<v Speaker 1>little else about grief.</v>

3909
02:53:19.401 --> 02:53:21.960
<v Speaker 1>You leafy green vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I should but I don't like.</v>

3910
02:53:21.990 --> 02:53:25.820
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I know I don't like broccoli.</v>

3911
02:53:26.690 --> 02:53:27.880
<v Speaker 1>Broccoli's edible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3912
02:53:28.040 --> 02:53:29.370
<v Speaker 1>I know I should.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

3913
02:53:29.420 --> 02:53:31.220
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my wife makes them and I'll eat a little</v>

3914
02:53:31.221 --> 02:53:32.420
<v Speaker 1>bit of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like a little kid.</v>

3915
02:53:32.550 --> 02:53:33.270
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

3916
02:53:33.270 --> 02:53:35.860
<v Speaker 1>but in my way it's like these arguments </v>
<v Speaker 1>I have with my eight year old.</v>

3917
02:53:35.861 --> 02:53:36.694
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

3918
02:53:37.010 --> 02:53:38.630
<v Speaker 1>And your year olds right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

3919
02:53:38.631 --> 02:53:42.100
<v Speaker 1>it turns out there are genes that make </v>
<v Speaker 1>people find broccoli more disgusting and</v>

3920
02:53:42.140 --> 02:53:42.973
<v Speaker 1>more at more bitter versus less bitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people really have their tongue </v>

3921
02:53:46.041 --> 02:53:47.600
<v Speaker 1>says no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>broccoli is called the beat,</v>

3922
02:53:47.601 --> 02:53:48.434
<v Speaker 1>a little baby gene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the one thing I would say there's </v>

3923
02:53:51.051 --> 02:53:51.884
<v Speaker 1>this really lovely study done with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>nice mix and what they did is they fed </v>

3924
02:53:54.441 --> 02:53:58.470
<v Speaker 1>people a couple of different foods and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you try a few and then you eat one until</v>

3925
02:53:58.490 --> 02:54:00.980
<v Speaker 1>you're full and then when you come back </v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

3926
02:54:00.980 --> 02:54:03.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you know this work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like paul rosin started with amnesiacs.</v>

3927
02:54:03.280 --> 02:54:03.860
<v Speaker 1>If you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I,</v>

3928
02:54:03.860 --> 02:54:06.350
<v Speaker 1>if you're densely in music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I talked to you.</v>

3929
02:54:06.351 --> 02:54:07.670
<v Speaker 1>I leave the room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I come back five minutes later.</v>

3930
02:54:07.671 --> 02:54:09.620
<v Speaker 1>You don't know who I am because you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>got brain damage.</v>

3931
02:54:09.980 --> 02:54:13.070
<v Speaker 1>When I come back with lunch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally you'll eat a second lunch.</v>

3932
02:54:13.130 --> 02:54:15.050
<v Speaker 1>We have such poor mechanism that tells </v>
<v Speaker 1>us we're full.</v>

3933
02:54:15.051 --> 02:54:16.380
<v Speaker 1>We think we do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We feel good.</v>

3934
02:54:16.550 --> 02:54:17.900
<v Speaker 1>I've had a great dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really full,</v>

3935
02:54:18.050 --> 02:54:18.883
<v Speaker 1>but we don't realize is that's really </v>
<v Speaker 1>driven a lot by the knowledge that we </v>

3936
02:54:20.901 --> 02:54:21.734
<v Speaker 1>just ate and so what rosin found when he</v>
<v Speaker 1>went back into he had eat lunch to your </v>

3937
02:54:25.281 --> 02:54:26.114
<v Speaker 1>fault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes back and says it's time for </v>

3938
02:54:27.051 --> 02:54:28.760
<v Speaker 1>lunch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and literally they all eat it again,</v>

3939
02:54:29.330 --> 02:54:32.330
<v Speaker 1>and so what's what's amazing about these</v>
<v Speaker 1>studies is then this follow up study,</v>

3940
02:54:32.331 --> 02:54:35.720
<v Speaker 1>what they did is they served amnesic or </v>
<v Speaker 1>control food people,</v>

3941
02:54:36.080 --> 02:54:38.360
<v Speaker 1>foods that they sampled and food that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they till their full.</v>

3942
02:54:39.110 --> 02:54:39.943
<v Speaker 1>So you sample potato chips and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>eat a tuna sandwich and now I come back </v>

3943
02:54:42.981 --> 02:54:45.350
<v Speaker 1>to you and say if you're a normal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I say,</v>

3944
02:54:45.680 --> 02:54:47.960
<v Speaker 1>do you want to eat a potato chip?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you want a tuna sandwich?</v>

3945
02:54:47.961 --> 02:54:49.100
<v Speaker 1>If you're normally say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3946
02:54:49.101 --> 02:54:49.934
<v Speaker 1>I just had lunch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not really that keen deed either of </v>

3947
02:54:50.841 --> 02:54:52.430
<v Speaker 1>them anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're uneasy,</v>

3948
02:54:53.000 --> 02:54:54.440
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want a tuna sandwich,</v>

3949
02:54:54.441 --> 02:54:55.274
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll have some potato chips and so you </v>

3950
02:54:57.201 --> 02:54:58.034
<v Speaker 1>don't even need to know you ate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so your hunger mechanism is still </v>

3951
02:55:00.771 --> 02:55:02.450
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the fact is you've had a lot of tuna</v>

3952
02:55:02.451 --> 02:55:04.580
<v Speaker 1>sandwich and that's controlling your </v>
<v Speaker 1>appetite.</v>

3953
02:55:04.581 --> 02:55:06.740
<v Speaker 1>It's making you feel like you don't want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to eat it anymore.</v>

3954
02:55:07.130 --> 02:55:08.840
<v Speaker 1>And so in the same sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go to a steakhouse,</v>

3955
02:55:09.110 --> 02:55:09.750
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>

3956
02:55:09.750 --> 02:55:10.790
<v Speaker 1>I love this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My favorite steak.</v>

3957
02:55:10.791 --> 02:55:13.160
<v Speaker 1>I could eat it forever and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>finish it or not,</v>

3958
02:55:13.430 --> 02:55:14.241
<v Speaker 1>and then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3959
02:55:14.241 --> 02:55:15.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm stuffed and somebody goes desert.</v>

3960
02:55:16.430 --> 02:55:16.911
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3961
02:55:16.911 --> 02:55:17.760
<v Speaker 1>that does sound good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3962
02:55:18.230 --> 02:55:20.690
<v Speaker 1>Because now you're shifting and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>eating something else,</v>

3963
02:55:21.070 --> 02:55:21.903
<v Speaker 1>and so I suspect that what guided our </v>
<v Speaker 1>ancestors was the fact they had no </v>

3964
02:55:24.501 --> 02:55:26.690
<v Speaker 1>variety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's for dinner was not a question you</v>

3965
02:55:26.691 --> 02:55:28.220
<v Speaker 1>ever asked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever dad killed him,</v>

3966
02:55:28.230 --> 02:55:30.200
<v Speaker 1>whatever mum dug up like there's two </v>
<v Speaker 1>things there.</v>

3967
02:55:30.201 --> 02:55:31.034
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you're going to gorge on the </v>

3968
02:55:31.860 --> 02:55:32.693
<v Speaker 1>meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not a vegetarian hunter gather </v>

3969
02:55:33.801 --> 02:55:35.240
<v Speaker 1>on the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You when you,</v>

3970
02:55:35.330 --> 02:55:37.790
<v Speaker 1>when you're hungry everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody loves me.</v>

3971
02:55:37.910 --> 02:55:39.590
<v Speaker 1>It's not only whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can every loves it.</v>

3972
02:55:39.591 --> 02:55:42.410
<v Speaker 1>Every in every hunter gatherer society </v>
<v Speaker 1>meet is a big deal.</v>

3973
02:55:42.411 --> 02:55:44.690
<v Speaker 1>Someone comes home with a big kill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a big deal.</v>

3974
02:55:45.230 --> 02:55:46.063
<v Speaker 1>When you can afford to be very well fed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suddenly you can start to think </v>

3975
02:55:47.901 --> 02:55:49.910
<v Speaker 1>differently and even have different </v>
<v Speaker 1>preferences,</v>

3976
02:55:49.911 --> 02:55:50.744
<v Speaker 1>but you don't if you're a hunter </v>
<v Speaker 1>gatherer and so literally if they had </v>

3977
02:55:53.301 --> 02:55:55.460
<v Speaker 1>killed a giraffe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just stuffing as much.</v>

3978
02:55:55.460 --> 02:55:58.490
<v Speaker 1>Draft me down the pipe as you can and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes sense for you to then evolve.</v>

3979
02:55:58.491 --> 02:55:59.324
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get nothing new out of </v>

3980
02:56:00.261 --> 02:56:01.650
<v Speaker 1>the giraffe you eat other than you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going gonna.</v>

3981
02:56:01.651 --> 02:56:04.550
<v Speaker 1>Pull it out the back end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's time to shut this dinner down.</v>

3982
02:56:04.551 --> 02:56:05.790
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you told me,</v>

3983
02:56:05.791 --> 02:56:06.624
<v Speaker 1>oh look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got this other thing that's </v>

3984
02:56:08.361 --> 02:56:08.721
<v Speaker 1>helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3985
02:56:08.721 --> 02:56:10.490
<v Speaker 1>there's nutrients in that I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>already have.</v>

3986
02:56:10.491 --> 02:56:12.140
<v Speaker 1>And so you could imagine getting hungry </v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

3987
02:56:12.141 --> 02:56:13.790
<v Speaker 1>That's what they did to suggest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3988
02:56:13.791 --> 02:56:14.624
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting because that's kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the argument that these carnivore diet </v>

3989
02:56:16.761 --> 02:56:17.594
<v Speaker 1>people use is that that is the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>beneficial food because that's the food </v>

3990
02:56:21.141 --> 02:56:23.770
<v Speaker 1>that you look forward to the most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right,</v>

3991
02:56:23.810 --> 02:56:26.420
<v Speaker 1>but don't forget you only need to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>this within every meal.</v>

3992
02:56:26.750 --> 02:56:27.583
<v Speaker 1>So if you sit down for your favorite </v>
<v Speaker 1>lobster dinner just to have lobster and </v>

3993
02:56:30.111 --> 02:56:32.450
<v Speaker 1>then that doesn't mean emptied it for </v>
<v Speaker 1>lunch or for breakfast tomorrow.</v>

3994
02:56:32.451 --> 02:56:34.670
<v Speaker 1>Now you can have pancakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever it is.</v>

3995
02:56:34.850 --> 02:56:35.683
<v Speaker 1>The key is within every meal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>minimize your variety because that's </v>

3996
02:56:38.601 --> 02:56:41.360
<v Speaker 1>where the effect is having itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have to carry over time.</v>

3997
02:56:41.361 --> 02:56:43.310
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean you lobster every single</v>
<v Speaker 1>meal.</v>

3998
02:56:43.370 --> 02:56:45.920
<v Speaker 1>You know it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's actually the gracie diet.</v>

3999
02:56:46.230 --> 02:56:47.063
<v Speaker 3>There's jujitsu family called the grace,</v>
<v Speaker 3>started the ufc and world famous </v>

4000
02:56:52.171 --> 02:56:54.480
<v Speaker 3>brazilian jiu jitsu family,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just a family,</v>

4001
02:56:54.481 --> 02:56:55.314
<v Speaker 3>philip killers and one of the founders,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe it was carlos gracie invented </v>

4002
02:56:59.911 --> 02:57:00.744
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He invented a diet that was basically </v>

4003
02:57:03.391 --> 02:57:06.180
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't mix foods together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're eating fruits,</v>

4004
02:57:06.181 --> 02:57:08.210
<v Speaker 3>you should eat fruits by themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You meet,</v>

4005
02:57:08.230 --> 02:57:09.063
<v Speaker 3>you eat that by itself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that in combining all these things </v>

4006
02:57:11.851 --> 02:57:12.684
<v Speaker 3>together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your body produces a variety of </v>

4007
02:57:13.861 --> 02:57:14.694
<v Speaker 3>different enzymes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't get as much nutritional </v>

4008
02:57:15.811 --> 02:57:16.470
<v Speaker 3>absorption.</v>

4009
02:57:16.470 --> 02:57:18.030
<v Speaker 1>Now that may be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>

4010
02:57:18.031 --> 02:57:18.864
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand the underlying bio </v>

4011
02:57:20.921 --> 02:57:21.950
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I do know,</v>

4012
02:57:21.980 --> 02:57:26.670
<v Speaker 1>the psychology suggests that you'll stop</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating sooner if within any one meal you</v>

4013
02:57:26.671 --> 02:57:27.504
<v Speaker 1>have less variety,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the psychological level we've we </v>

4014
02:57:29.101 --> 02:57:32.790
<v Speaker 1>appear to have evolved to not want that </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

4015
02:57:32.791 --> 02:57:36.660
<v Speaker 1>When we've had enough of that be it a </v>
<v Speaker 1>taro root or mom dug up or a giraffe are</v>

4016
02:57:36.661 --> 02:57:37.494
<v Speaker 1>dad shot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so these sort of evolutionary traits </v>

4017
02:57:41.130 --> 02:57:41.560
<v Speaker 1>that are</v>

4018
02:57:41.560 --> 02:57:43.810
<v Speaker 3>inside of our bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would.</v>

4019
02:57:43.990 --> 02:57:44.823
<v Speaker 3>They would sort of encourage us to eat </v>
<v Speaker 3>much more if we have a variety of </v>

4020
02:57:49.091 --> 02:57:51.130
<v Speaker 3>different foods.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're eating at a buffet in vegas,</v>

4021
02:57:51.260 --> 02:57:54.360
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>versus if you just eating chicken,</v>

4022
02:57:54.470 --> 02:57:57.300
<v Speaker 1>that chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll eat as much chicken as really you</v>

4023
02:57:57.301 --> 02:58:00.330
<v Speaker 1>need and then you'll stay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want any more chicken,</v>

4024
02:58:00.350 --> 02:58:02.160
<v Speaker 1>but if there's chicken mashed potatoes </v>
<v Speaker 1>and corn</v>

4025
02:58:02.160 --> 02:58:02.993
<v Speaker 2>on the cob and then cole slaw and our </v>
<v Speaker 2>ancestors never faced that prompts the </v>

4026
02:58:06.131 --> 02:58:06.964
<v Speaker 2>date.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't know how to deal with it and </v>

4027
02:58:08.311 --> 02:58:10.350
<v Speaker 2>the other side of that coin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what steve simpson did,</v>

4028
02:58:10.351 --> 02:58:12.530
<v Speaker 2>this guy who did the early study on </v>
<v Speaker 2>protein and locus,</v>

4029
02:58:12.610 --> 02:58:13.443
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he took his biology students on field </v>

4030
02:58:15.511 --> 02:58:16.344
<v Speaker 2>trips and he would talk to the food to </v>
<v Speaker 2>increase the protein in the food or </v>

4031
02:58:18.931 --> 02:58:19.764
<v Speaker 2>decrease it in the food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's the exact same foods like to </v>

4032
02:58:21.280 --> 02:58:23.700
<v Speaker 2>read in the same roles in the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>sushi,</v>

4033
02:58:23.880 --> 02:58:24.713
<v Speaker 2>but he's increasing levels of protein in</v>
<v Speaker 2>those foods and then it's a buffet and </v>

4034
02:58:28.621 --> 02:58:29.454
<v Speaker 2>all he does is weigh the food when it </v>
<v Speaker 2>starts and when it finishes across all </v>

4035
02:58:31.600 --> 02:58:34.470
<v Speaker 2>the students eating it and he found that</v>
<v Speaker 2>as the protein levels go up,</v>

4036
02:58:34.650 --> 02:58:37.050
<v Speaker 2>the amount of food that people eat at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the buffet goes down.</v>

4037
02:58:37.470 --> 02:58:39.150
<v Speaker 2>So there's these two parallel </v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanisms,</v>

4038
02:58:39.151 --> 02:58:43.200
<v Speaker 2>one were made of protein and so that </v>
<v Speaker 2>seems carbs do drive appetite,</v>

4039
02:58:43.201 --> 02:58:45.330
<v Speaker 2>but not nearly as strongly as proteins </v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

4040
02:58:45.590 --> 02:58:46.423
<v Speaker 2>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the tolerance and how much courage to </v>

4041
02:58:47.641 --> 02:58:49.020
<v Speaker 2>lead is huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The tolerance,</v>

4042
02:58:49.021 --> 02:58:49.854
<v Speaker 2>how much protein.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Juliet is very narrow and he finds out </v>

4043
02:58:51.960 --> 02:58:52.793
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he finds that in crickets and now </v>

4044
02:58:53.581 --> 02:58:54.414
<v Speaker 2>he finds it in humans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I think the other side of that </v>

4045
02:58:56.341 --> 02:58:57.330
<v Speaker 2>coin is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is variety.</v>

4046
02:58:57.331 --> 02:59:00.390
<v Speaker 2>And the bad luck for us right now is we </v>
<v Speaker 2>live in a world where,</v>

4047
02:59:00.630 --> 02:59:03.210
<v Speaker 2>especially if you're poor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>proteins are expensive and hard to get.</v>

4048
02:59:03.211 --> 02:59:04.044
<v Speaker 2>So you're going to have these high carb </v>
<v Speaker 2>diets and then everybody can have </v>

4049
02:59:06.061 --> 02:59:10.560
<v Speaker 2>variety and variety is probably a really</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad thing that is so fascinating is that</v>

4050
02:59:10.561 --> 02:59:13.980
<v Speaker 2>are our good fortune is our demise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

4051
02:59:14.120 --> 02:59:15.330
<v Speaker 2>And in so many ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4052
02:59:15.530 --> 02:59:17.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we evolved to seek out fat,</v>

4053
02:59:17.011 --> 02:59:19.310
<v Speaker 2>sugar and salt because they were in </v>
<v Speaker 2>short supply another every.</v>

4054
02:59:19.440 --> 02:59:21.330
<v Speaker 2>Now you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you eat them every time you see them,</v>

4055
02:59:21.331 --> 02:59:22.290
<v Speaker 2>you're stuffed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4056
02:59:22.320 --> 02:59:23.640
<v Speaker 2>They're everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

4057
02:59:23.670 --> 02:59:26.190
<v Speaker 2>I mean everything you eat as fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sugar and salt.</v>

4058
02:59:26.191 --> 02:59:27.210
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the other,</v>

4059
02:59:27.420 --> 02:59:29.580
<v Speaker 2>it's not just what you eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We also evolved.</v>

4060
02:59:29.581 --> 02:59:32.590
<v Speaker 2>So if there's a novel per person in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>opposite sex,</v>

4061
02:59:32.591 --> 02:59:33.590
<v Speaker 2>it comes along.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boy,</v>

4062
02:59:33.591 --> 02:59:35.280
<v Speaker 2>what a rare event that was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe fat.</v>

4063
02:59:35.281 --> 02:59:36.260
<v Speaker 2>sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

4064
02:59:36.270 --> 02:59:37.800
<v Speaker 2>You should jump on that train,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4065
02:59:37.980 --> 02:59:39.780
<v Speaker 2>Because that'll give you a new genetic </v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunities,</v>

4066
02:59:39.781 --> 02:59:41.970
<v Speaker 2>but you look out the door,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's novelty everywhere.</v>

4067
02:59:41.971 --> 02:59:42.804
<v Speaker 2>it's super hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to stay married in the city </v>

4068
02:59:44.161 --> 02:59:44.994
<v Speaker 2>than it is in the country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to stay married if you're a </v>

4069
02:59:46.411 --> 02:59:47.244
<v Speaker 2>celebrity than if you're a nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because those people are just dev </v>

4070
02:59:49.560 --> 02:59:52.260
<v Speaker 2>novelty constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have variety constantly.</v>

4071
02:59:52.530 --> 02:59:54.120
<v Speaker 2>And the rest of us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you know,</v>

4072
02:59:54.180 --> 02:59:56.250
<v Speaker 2>there may be variety out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're not interested in me.</v>

4073
02:59:56.251 --> 02:59:57.560
<v Speaker 2>So it's kind of irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway.</v>

4074
02:59:57.570 --> 03:00:00.030
<v Speaker 2>All right bill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank you so much.</v>

4075
03:00:00.790 --> 03:00:03.690
<v Speaker 2>I can't wait to read your book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Excellent approach for everybody.</v>

4076
03:00:04.140 --> 03:00:09.140
<v Speaker 2>It's available right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go get it.</v>

4077
03:00:09.381 --> 03:00:10.940
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fox is awesome.</v>

4078
03:00:10.941 --> 03:00:11.950
<v Speaker 2>Thank you so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

4079
03:00:11.960 --> 03:00:12.920
<v Speaker 2>Really fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of fun.</v>

4080
03:00:12.950 --> 03:00:14.420
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bye everybody.</v>

4081
03:00:23.100 --> 03:00:23.933
<v Speaker 5>That's amazing.</v>
