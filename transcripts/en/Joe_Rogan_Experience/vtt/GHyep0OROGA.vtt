4
00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:14.570

<v Speaker 1>I just realized that,</v>

5
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.260
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably do something to stop that</v>

6
00:00:17.261 --> 00:00:20.530
<v Speaker 1>while we're doing the podcast.</v>

8
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's the right way to</v>
<v Speaker 1>say it.</v>

9
00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:25.593
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You're like a legitimate archer.</v>

12
00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.781
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You practicing your,</v>

15
00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.090
<v Speaker 1>it's incredibly addictive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

00:00:41.091 --> 00:00:41.690
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

17
00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:42.523
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

18
00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.440
<v Speaker 1>very satisfying and it's a great God</v>
<v Speaker 1>damn metaphor for everything.</v>

19
00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:49.580
<v Speaker 1>Thank you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sir.</v>

20
00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.540
<v Speaker 2>Dunkin's doing the traditional way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got the wooden Arrow shafts and the</v>

21
00:00:56.541 --> 00:00:59.030
<v Speaker 2>traditional recurve bow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which by the way,</v>

22
00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.810
<v Speaker 2>anytime I post a picture of archery or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that,</v>

23
00:01:02.811 --> 00:01:03.980
<v Speaker 2>you get that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you know,</v>

24
00:01:03.981 --> 00:01:05.590
<v Speaker 2>using traditional bill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

25
00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:07.311
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing it.</v>

26
00:01:07.311 --> 00:01:08.110
<v Speaker 2>The manway.</v>

27
00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.450
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm traditionally missing the fucking</v>

28
00:01:10.451 --> 00:01:11.284
<v Speaker 1>target too.</v>

29
00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.240
<v Speaker 2>Some guys hunt like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which when you,</v>

30
00:01:17.241 --> 00:01:21.080
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's guys that are obviously</v>

31
00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.140
<v Speaker 2>way better at that shit than you or I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you think about like what you</v>

32
00:01:26.781 --> 00:01:29.300
<v Speaker 2>were shooting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how you are shooting today and how I was</v>

33
00:01:29.301 --> 00:01:34.070
<v Speaker 2>shooting both today and imagine trying</v>
<v Speaker 2>to hit an animal,</v>

34
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.870
<v Speaker 2>like maybe even a moving animal.</v>

35
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.740
<v Speaker 1>It's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're using what you're shooting</v>

36
00:01:39.741 --> 00:01:43.010
<v Speaker 1>with doesn't even look like a bow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like some something that fell</v>

37
00:01:43.011 --> 00:01:47.900
<v Speaker 1>out of a diamond shaped spaceship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really weird.</v>

38
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.060
<v Speaker 1>It's a very weird looking bow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas like my bow basic robin hood</v>

39
00:01:53.061 --> 00:01:56.000
<v Speaker 1>style recurve bow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I get it,</v>

40
00:01:56.001 --> 00:01:59.390
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would not want to hunt an animal with</v>

41
00:01:59.391 --> 00:02:02.620
<v Speaker 1>a recurve bow because it seems like it</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be inhumane.</v>

42
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.930
<v Speaker 1>Like it seems that unless you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to kill something,</v>

43
00:02:05.931 --> 00:02:09.110
<v Speaker 1>be very precise about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm sure people with recurve bows</v>

44
00:02:09.111 --> 00:02:10.100
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

45
00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.210
<v Speaker 1>if they eve shot your whole life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is precise I guess.</v>

46
00:02:13.211 --> 00:02:13.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

47
00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.260
<v Speaker 2>they could be probably close to as</v>
<v Speaker 2>precise as I am with uh,</v>

48
00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.270
<v Speaker 2>a compound bow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But not for like long distances.</v>

49
00:02:22.271 --> 00:02:24.460
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a really can't cover the same kind</v>

50
00:02:24.461 --> 00:02:27.550
<v Speaker 2>of distance I can shoot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we were shooting today.</v>

51
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.500
<v Speaker 2>Well I shot that elk target at 65 yards</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was putting it in the heart at 65</v>

52
00:02:32.501 --> 00:02:35.350
<v Speaker 2>yards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would be really,</v>

53
00:02:35.351 --> 00:02:36.250
<v Speaker 2>really hard to do.</v>

54
00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.590
<v Speaker 1>Recurve bow and Leon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

55
00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.500
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to have a very powerful bow</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do that.</v>

56
00:02:42.501 --> 00:02:43.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a big,</v>

57
00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.320
<v Speaker 1>seems to be part of the problem though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

58
00:02:45.321 --> 00:02:46.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know anything about it.</v>

59
00:02:46.941 --> 00:02:48.500
<v Speaker 1>Like I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

60
00:02:48.501 --> 00:02:51.320
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember after the last podcast we</v>

61
00:02:51.321 --> 00:02:53.540
<v Speaker 1>did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you show me your bow and then that kind</v>

62
00:02:53.541 --> 00:02:55.220
<v Speaker 1>of floated around in my head a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>

63
00:02:55.221 --> 00:02:55.581
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

64
00:02:55.581 --> 00:02:57.980
<v Speaker 1>that'd be cool to start shooting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I've,</v>

65
00:02:57.981 --> 00:02:59.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now I have a yard.</v>

66
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:00.183
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

<v Speaker 3>doing yard work.</v>

68
00:03:02.831 --> 00:03:03.521

71
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.150
<v Speaker 3>But now it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the best.</v>

72
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.120
<v Speaker 3>Something clicks inside of you where</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just like,</v>

73

<v Speaker 3>Like the leaf blower,</v>

77
00:03:28.391 --> 00:03:31.270
<v Speaker 3>you could reverse it and suck leaves</v>
<v Speaker 3>into a bag and it's just like,</v>

00:03:58.551 --> 00:04:01.470
<v Speaker 2>people do where they just comb the sand</v>
<v Speaker 2>perfectly.</v>

89
00:04:01.471 --> 00:04:02.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

90
00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:03.630
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now that's very interesting.</v>

91
00:04:03.631 --> 00:04:06.030
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that process of like being in the</v>

92
00:04:06.031 --> 00:04:08.280
<v Speaker 3>moment and then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

93
00:04:08.281 --> 00:04:10.170
<v Speaker 3>doing anything in the moment is</v>
<v Speaker 3>incredible.</v>

94
00:04:10.171 --> 00:04:11.880
<v Speaker 3>But I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

95
00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.420
<v Speaker 3>I spent a long time not going outside</v>
<v Speaker 3>enough and that is a really fucking</v>

96
00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.550
<v Speaker 3>awful thing that can happen to you where</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just forget about outside.</v>

97
00:04:23.551 --> 00:04:28.020
<v Speaker 3>Like outside is the place between your</v>
<v Speaker 3>house and your car or your car and your</v>

98
00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.030
<v Speaker 3>office.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's outside.</v>

99
00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.850
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so when you're not outside and</v>

100
00:04:32.851 --> 00:04:34.680
<v Speaker 3>you're living inside the artificial</v>
<v Speaker 3>cave,</v>

101
00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.710
<v Speaker 3>you're cutting yourself off from a very</v>
<v Speaker 3>specific field of data that it starts</v>

102
00:04:41.071 --> 00:04:43.860
<v Speaker 3>teaching you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're out there in it at all for any</v>

103
00:04:43.861 --> 00:04:44.940
<v Speaker 3>amount of time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

104
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.460
<v Speaker 3>it's a narcotic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like Ow,</v>

105
00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.310
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been inside so much that I feel</v>

106
00:04:50.311 --> 00:04:54.420
<v Speaker 3>when I go outside,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I've taken a vicodin or something.</v>

107
00:04:54.421 --> 00:04:55.410
<v Speaker 3>It feels that good.</v>

108
00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.650
<v Speaker 3>Is this like during the dark days of</v>
<v Speaker 3>video game addiction?</v>

109
00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.630
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

110
00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:01.441
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>

111
00:05:01.441 --> 00:05:02.400
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

112
00:05:02.401 --> 00:05:02.730
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

113
00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.070
<v Speaker 3>Video Game Addiction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Internet addiction.</v>

114
00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:10.460
<v Speaker 3>Just a general feeling that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the outside is just,</v>

115
00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.020
<v Speaker 3>you just don't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're just in too much,</v>

116
00:05:13.021 --> 00:05:14.890
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think it's a,</v>

117
00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.090
<v Speaker 3>it's so many people are afflicted by</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

118
00:05:18.091 --> 00:05:22.980
<v Speaker 3>that you get so disconnected from this</v>
<v Speaker 3>rhythm that's out there,</v>

119
00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.410
<v Speaker 3>that when you finally start feeling it</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

120
00:05:25.411 --> 00:05:29.580
<v Speaker 3>it's like eating something when you</v>
<v Speaker 3>haven't been eating in a long time or</v>

121
00:05:29.581 --> 00:05:32.760
<v Speaker 3>drinking something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just want to stay out there and feel</v>

122
00:05:32.761 --> 00:05:34.890
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>

123
00:05:34.891 --> 00:05:35.560
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got the,</v>

124
00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.200
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I knew I'd put me outside more,</v>

125
00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:39.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got to let these people know that</v>

126
00:05:39.791 --> 00:05:42.850
<v Speaker 2>we're alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't tweet it to me one second here,</v>

127
00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:43.870
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

128
00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.240
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what made you decide to get that kind of</v>

129
00:05:46.241 --> 00:05:49.510
<v Speaker 2>a bow or did you have someone help you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you go to an archery place or how'd</v>

130
00:05:49.511 --> 00:05:49.920
<v Speaker 2>you do it?</v>

131
00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went to an archery place.</v>

132
00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:53.280
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>

133
00:05:53.281 --> 00:05:54.360
<v Speaker 3>and the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

134
00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.620
<v Speaker 3>the guys show me compound bows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

135
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.190
<v Speaker 1>it as far as I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're not shooting a recurve bow,</v>

136
00:06:01.191 --> 00:06:03.260
<v Speaker 1>you're not really shooting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not a man.</v>

137
00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:05.150
<v Speaker 1>You're not a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

138
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.761
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

139
00:06:05.761 --> 00:06:07.970
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the compound bows,</v>

140
00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:09.530
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a commitment.</v>

141
00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:12.740
<v Speaker 1>It looks like too much of a commitment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's too much going on there.</v>

142
00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:15.560
<v Speaker 1>It's a serious thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like it's for hunting.</v>

143
00:06:15.561 --> 00:06:20.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't intend to go hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to stand outside shooting</v>

144
00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:25.490
<v Speaker 1>and with a little poodle sits by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pool and watches me and I just shoot</v>

145
00:06:25.491 --> 00:06:27.530
<v Speaker 1>arrows and it's a fucking blast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>

146
00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:29.120
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this guy,</v>

147
00:06:29.121 --> 00:06:30.660
<v Speaker 1>this kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

148
00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:35.690
<v Speaker 1>he was like a are arched who's like done</v>
<v Speaker 1>archery his entire life.</v>

149
00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.400
<v Speaker 1>I know nothing about this fucking thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I hope I don't seem like I'm an</v>

150
00:06:40.401 --> 00:06:42.170
<v Speaker 1>expert on our eye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like no two weeks,</v>

151
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:45.860
<v Speaker 1>two week obsession.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this kid is like explaining it to me</v>

152
00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.320
<v Speaker 1>about uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

153
00:06:48.321 --> 00:06:50.630
<v Speaker 1>the difference between a recurve bow and</v>
<v Speaker 1>a compound bow.</v>

154
00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:54.800
<v Speaker 1>And he said basically a compound bow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything's better than a recurve bow,</v>

155
00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:59.390
<v Speaker 1>but a recurve bows a great way to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I get this recurve bow,</v>

156
00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:02.360
<v Speaker 1>the little bastard sells me the wrong</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking arrows,</v>

157
00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:05.480
<v Speaker 1>which I didn't even find out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He sold me compound bows arrows.</v>

158
00:07:05.481 --> 00:07:09.710
<v Speaker 1>And so like I was shooting with those</v>
<v Speaker 1>for awhile and each of them would be</v>

159
00:07:09.711 --> 00:07:14.711
<v Speaker 1>precisely off and the exact same place</v>
<v Speaker 1>because compound bow arrows are there,</v>

160
00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:18.260
<v Speaker 1>plastic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vinyl,</v>

161
00:07:18.261 --> 00:07:23.120
<v Speaker 1>whatever that shit is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when they hit the bow they at least</v>

162
00:07:23.121 --> 00:07:27.680
<v Speaker 1>when they hit a recurve bow and they hit</v>
<v Speaker 1>the arrow rest if throws them off in a</v>

163
00:07:27.681 --> 00:07:30.020
<v Speaker 1>specific way where its feathers are more</v>
<v Speaker 1>pliable.</v>

164
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:34.520
<v Speaker 1>This is what somebody explained to me</v>
<v Speaker 1>after I went back and my sons these</v>

165
00:07:34.521 --> 00:07:35.301
<v Speaker 1>other areas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But man,</v>

166
00:07:35.301 --> 00:07:35.810
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

167
00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:38.030
<v Speaker 1>it's an addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's expensive.</v>

168
00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:42.440
<v Speaker 1>You keep wanting to buy shit and add</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff on to it and upgrade.</v>

169
00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:44.690
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really fun though.</v>

170
00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:47.300
<v Speaker 1>Will the compound bows even more</v>
<v Speaker 1>addictive because there's different</v>

171
00:07:47.301 --> 00:07:49.260
<v Speaker 1>kinds of sites and different kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>rests in,</v>

172
00:07:49.261 --> 00:07:52.700
<v Speaker 1>there's drop away rest and there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>whisker biscuits and has all these diff</v>

173
00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:54.230
<v Speaker 1>whisker biscuits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

174
00:07:54.231 --> 00:07:57.170
<v Speaker 1>it's like a bunch of different fibers</v>
<v Speaker 1>than your Arrow sits on.</v>

175
00:07:57.171 --> 00:08:00.130
<v Speaker 1>So instead of arrest us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so like a lot of people have a rest is</v>

176
00:08:00.131 --> 00:08:04.370
<v Speaker 1>called a drop away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rest meaning as you release the Arrow,</v>

177
00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:08.030
<v Speaker 1>the cables and the strings to the rest</v>
<v Speaker 1>are attached.</v>

178
00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:10.610
<v Speaker 1>So as you were drawn back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

179
00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:13.760
<v Speaker 1>the rest is up and your arrows sitting</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the rest.</v>

180
00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:18.790
<v Speaker 1>As you release the rest drops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the Arrow takes off on the string</v>

181
00:08:19.251 --> 00:08:21.470
<v Speaker 1>without the resistance of the rest being</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

182
00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.660
<v Speaker 1>It's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just launches it in the air.</v>

183
00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:26.840
<v Speaker 1>That's a whisker biscuit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the kind where it's a bunch of</v>

184
00:08:26.841 --> 00:08:31.550
<v Speaker 1>fibers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which over long periods of time can like</v>

185
00:08:31.551 --> 00:08:35.390
<v Speaker 1>long distances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can slightly affect the amount of feet</v>

186
00:08:35.391 --> 00:08:36.770
<v Speaker 1>per second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not much,</v>

187
00:08:36.771 --> 00:08:40.100
<v Speaker 1>but like two or three seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two or three feet per second over the</v>

188
00:08:40.101 --> 00:08:42.470
<v Speaker 1>course of like 40 yards or something</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>

189
00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:44.360
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

190
00:08:44.361 --> 00:08:47.540
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about the difference</v>
<v Speaker 1>between like 288 feet per second,</v>

191
00:08:47.541 --> 00:08:49.190
<v Speaker 1>285 feet per second.</v>

192
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:52.700
<v Speaker 1>Like it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still insanely fast and powerful.</v>

193
00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:55.680
<v Speaker 1>So that's some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people like Dattocon that whisker</v>

194
00:08:55.681 --> 00:08:56.040
<v Speaker 1>biscuit</v>

195
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.440
<v Speaker 4>con,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but mine is the one that drops away.</v>

196
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:02.640
<v Speaker 4>It's so cool that this thing has evolved</v>
<v Speaker 4>to this point.</v>

197
00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:04.300
<v Speaker 4>That crazy amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

198
00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:07.200
<v Speaker 4>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now all the different evolutions that</v>

199
00:09:07.201 --> 00:09:11.700
<v Speaker 4>the bow has had from the moment somebody</v>
<v Speaker 4>realized if you take a tight string and</v>

200
00:09:11.701 --> 00:09:14.130
<v Speaker 4>put it between sticks and pull it back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well you know,</v>

201
00:09:14.131 --> 00:09:17.880
<v Speaker 4>yours is a recurve and a recurve is a</v>
<v Speaker 4>totally different thing.</v>

202
00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:20.720
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was like the original compound</v>

203
00:09:20.721 --> 00:09:21.140
<v Speaker 4>book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

204
00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:25.050
<v Speaker 4>It was the original technology because</v>
<v Speaker 4>they figured because of the curve of the</v>

205
00:09:25.051 --> 00:09:28.650
<v Speaker 4>way your bow is designed that you can</v>
<v Speaker 4>generate much more power that way.</v>

206
00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:33.030
<v Speaker 4>The regular kind of long bows,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was the old school kind that you've</v>

207
00:09:33.031 --> 00:09:35.130
<v Speaker 4>seen like the Robin Hood days and shit</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>

208
00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:39.840
<v Speaker 4>But the recurve was like the Mongols,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like someone around that time figured</v>

209
00:09:39.841 --> 00:09:43.610
<v Speaker 4>out how to make that and they made these</v>
<v Speaker 4>bows with um,</v>

210
00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:49.370
<v Speaker 4>insanely powerful would and they used</v>
<v Speaker 4>animal horn and all kinds of other shit</v>

211
00:09:49.831 --> 00:09:52.200
<v Speaker 4>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they made some glues and one of the</v>

212
00:09:52.201 --> 00:09:55.530
<v Speaker 4>things with their glues was when it was</v>
<v Speaker 4>raining out,</v>

213
00:09:55.531 --> 00:09:59.010
<v Speaker 4>they couldn't fight right there fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bozo and fall apart.</v>

214
00:09:59.011 --> 00:10:00.210
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was so cute.</v>

215
00:10:00.211 --> 00:10:02.400
<v Speaker 4>It was pouring rain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They had to get the fuck out of dodge</v>

216
00:10:02.401 --> 00:10:04.560
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Their bowls would fall apart.</v>

217
00:10:04.561 --> 00:10:07.420
<v Speaker 4>If the paste and shit they have holding</v>
<v Speaker 4>them together,</v>

218
00:10:07.421 --> 00:10:08.520
<v Speaker 4>it got wet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

219
00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:09.960
<v Speaker 4>That's so weird.</v>

220
00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:17.210
<v Speaker 4>There's so many things that throughout</v>
<v Speaker 4>history there's so many unknown people</v>

221
00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:24.290
<v Speaker 4>who figured out these amazing things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like someone figured out how to advance</v>

222
00:10:25.261 --> 00:10:27.840
<v Speaker 4>the boat to the point that it became a</v>
<v Speaker 4>long boat.</v>

223
00:10:27.841 --> 00:10:31.680
<v Speaker 4>Like someone worked that and before that</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone just figure to me all of these</v>

224
00:10:31.681 --> 00:10:36.480
<v Speaker 4>little moments in history are so</v>
<v Speaker 4>interesting and so frustrating because</v>

225
00:10:36.481 --> 00:10:40.110
<v Speaker 4>most of them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll never witness that moment.</v>

226
00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:43.350
<v Speaker 4>Like the moment somebody made fire,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a thing.</v>

227
00:10:43.351 --> 00:10:46.950
<v Speaker 4>You'll never see that one because</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone had to do at first.</v>

228
00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:49.800
<v Speaker 4>Now maybe people did it all over the</v>
<v Speaker 4>planet at the same time.</v>

229
00:10:49.801 --> 00:10:52.350
<v Speaker 4>Or if there are people over the planet</v>
<v Speaker 4>depending on which,</v>

230
00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:54.390
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which uh,</v>

231
00:10:54.391 --> 00:10:56.720
<v Speaker 4>explanation for how people got her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you've,</v>

232
00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:58.770
<v Speaker 4>you've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think Hancock believes people were</v>

233
00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:01.960
<v Speaker 4>spread out way before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

234
00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:04.140
<v Speaker 4>the out of Africa theory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

235
00:11:04.141 --> 00:11:07.050
<v Speaker 4>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone somewhere figured out how to do</v>

236
00:11:07.051 --> 00:11:07.220
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

237
00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:11.550
<v Speaker 4>So they probably saw something happen</v>
<v Speaker 4>that caused a fire and then they tried</v>

238
00:11:11.551 --> 00:11:13.200
<v Speaker 4>to recreate it until they were</v>
<v Speaker 4>successful.</v>

239
00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.850
<v Speaker 4>At the moment they were successful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The mind,</v>

240
00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:18.300
<v Speaker 4>the imagine the fucking look on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>guy's face.</v>

241
00:11:18.301 --> 00:11:20.430
<v Speaker 4>The first car that figured out he can</v>
<v Speaker 4>make fire on his own.</v>

242
00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:22.200
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the first guy that you used one of</v>

243
00:11:22.201 --> 00:11:26.100
<v Speaker 4>those bose with the bits and the tkc</v>
<v Speaker 4>knows we use two hands that the real</v>

244
00:11:26.101 --> 00:11:28.980
<v Speaker 4>hardcore guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they use a bow with a bit in their</v>

245
00:11:28.981 --> 00:11:31.140
<v Speaker 4>teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they put the bit in their teeth and</v>

246
00:11:31.141 --> 00:11:32.610
<v Speaker 4>then there's a stick,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

247
00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:36.120
<v Speaker 4>And then they have the boat and because</v>
<v Speaker 4>of that they can use two hands.</v>

248
00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:38.770
<v Speaker 4>So they're clamping down on the bit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They go like this.</v>

249
00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:46.290
<v Speaker 4>You just see it starts smoking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was a guy that was on one of those</v>

250
00:11:46.291 --> 00:11:48.750
<v Speaker 4>crazy mountain men shows.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know which one it was,</v>

251
00:11:48.751 --> 00:11:52.560
<v Speaker 4>but one of those shows where dudes are</v>
<v Speaker 4>living alone and the fucking life below</v>

252
00:11:52.561 --> 00:11:53.680
<v Speaker 4>zero.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's who it was.</v>

253
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:56.740
<v Speaker 4>It was the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the guy in life below zero who lives by</v>

254
00:11:56.741 --> 00:12:01.741
<v Speaker 4>himself in like a tool shed is like this</v>
<v Speaker 4>tiny little shack in Alaska where he's</v>

255
00:12:02.561 --> 00:12:06.790
<v Speaker 4>miles and miles and miles from</v>
<v Speaker 4>civilization and for most of the year</v>

256
00:12:06.791 --> 00:12:11.200
<v Speaker 4>this guy lives like this where he just</v>
<v Speaker 4>subsist off the land by himself.</v>

257
00:12:11.201 --> 00:12:14.590
<v Speaker 4>He just eats Caribou.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He has to fend wolves off of his</v>

258
00:12:14.591 --> 00:12:17.720
<v Speaker 4>property.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He and he doesn't bring matches with</v>

259
00:12:17.721 --> 00:12:20.020
<v Speaker 4>them because you could always run out of</v>
<v Speaker 4>matches.</v>

260
00:12:20.021 --> 00:12:22.450
<v Speaker 4>He wants to be able to make a fire</v>
<v Speaker 4>consistently on his own.</v>

261
00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:24.620
<v Speaker 4>So he brings this bit and the bow.</v>

262
00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:26.680
<v Speaker 4>That's how he starts his fires.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's cool.</v>

263
00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:28.660
<v Speaker 4>It's the sane,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's super cool.</v>

264
00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:31.120
<v Speaker 4>Insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you seen the youtube primitive</v>

265
00:12:31.121 --> 00:12:33.380
<v Speaker 4>technology channel?</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's like a guy,</v>

267
00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:37.450
<v Speaker 4>I don't know where he is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's somewhere where there's a lot of</v>

<v Speaker 4>hut just using mud and fire.</v>

270
00:12:47.351 --> 00:12:52.351
<v Speaker 4>Like he built his own kiln and he can</v>
<v Speaker 4>bake his own tiles and Whoa,</v>

<v Speaker 4>no talking either.</v>

273
00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:58.870

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:01.660
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he's a bad ass man.</v>

275
00:13:01.661 --> 00:13:04.720
<v Speaker 4>That guy is really cool and that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff is amazing.</v>

276
00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:08.230
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing to know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the foundational,</v>

277
00:13:08.231 --> 00:13:09.220
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>amazing.</v>

278
00:13:09.221 --> 00:13:11.890
<v Speaker 4>When you find one guy who is cause it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking blisters.</v>

279
00:13:11.891 --> 00:13:14.650
<v Speaker 4>She's just [inaudible] his hands.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he's just showing you everything.</v>

280
00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:17.290
<v Speaker 4>That's so interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's not saying a word right now.</v>

281
00:13:17.291 --> 00:13:20.320
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't say anything now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just like,</v>

282
00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:23.380
<v Speaker 4>here's the kind of rocky is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's an awesome skill to have.</v>

283
00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:25.810
<v Speaker 4>It really is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know what the fucking problem</v>

284
00:13:25.811 --> 00:13:28.480
<v Speaker 4>with this kind of privative shit is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I don't want to sound like,</v>

285
00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:29.963
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

286
00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:34.930
<v Speaker 4>pessimistic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but oftentimes if it's down to using</v>

287
00:13:34.931 --> 00:13:38.410
<v Speaker 4>this kind of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean this is what we're back down to.</v>

288
00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:42.400
<v Speaker 4>We're fucked you mom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You almost don't want to make it.</v>

289
00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:47.260
<v Speaker 4>She'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's the way the human race is</v>

290
00:13:47.261 --> 00:13:49.270
<v Speaker 4>depicted in that movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The road.</v>

291
00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:52.780
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's probably real close to how it would</v>

292
00:13:52.781 --> 00:13:53.740
<v Speaker 4>go down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

293
00:13:53.741 --> 00:13:56.140
<v Speaker 4>look at the way life was during the</v>
<v Speaker 4>black play.</v>

294
00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:57.150
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

295
00:13:57.150 --> 00:14:01.090
<v Speaker 4>it was like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a semi apocalypse that swept</v>

296
00:14:01.091 --> 00:14:04.420
<v Speaker 4>around the planet and people became</v>
<v Speaker 4>insane.</v>

297
00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:06.670
<v Speaker 4>They thought ringing bells would cure</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

298
00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:11.970
<v Speaker 4>People slide very quickly away from the</v>
<v Speaker 4>land of logic and science when shit gets</v>

299
00:14:13.271 --> 00:14:14.650
<v Speaker 4>weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well not only that,</v>

300
00:14:14.651 --> 00:14:17.080
<v Speaker 4>the logic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the word of logic and science is only</v>

301
00:14:17.081 --> 00:14:20.110
<v Speaker 4>connected through electricity and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>electricity goes out.</v>

302
00:14:20.111 --> 00:14:23.620
<v Speaker 4>That logic and science goes with it and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get back the same kind of bullshit</v>

303
00:14:23.621 --> 00:14:25.750
<v Speaker 4>and it used to have in the 80s when</v>
<v Speaker 4>dudes are like,</v>

304
00:14:25.751 --> 00:14:27.840
<v Speaker 4>you know what I her bro,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I heard there's a fucking page</v>

305
00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:29.250
<v Speaker 4>underneath the Penthouse,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

306
00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:30.610

<v Speaker 4>bro.</v>

307

00:14:33.821 --> 00:14:37.360
<v Speaker 4>my uncle worked for the secret service.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's deep inside the heart of darkness.</v>

310
00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:40.900
<v Speaker 4>Those were the days,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the days people would just make shit up.</v>

311
00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:45.040

<v Speaker 4>But when people today do not understand</v>

312
00:14:45.041 --> 00:14:47.200
<v Speaker 4>how much of a fucking problem that was</v>
<v Speaker 4>when we were growing up,</v>

313
00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:50.230
<v Speaker 4>these people that would just make up</v>

320
00:15:06.411 --> 00:15:09.020
<v Speaker 4>No way to investigate someone super</v>
<v Speaker 4>common.</v>

321
00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:10.860
<v Speaker 4>You have to hire a private eye.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

322
00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:14.510
<v Speaker 4>Especially if a guy like read a book and</v>
<v Speaker 4>like knew a lot about the time period.</v>

323
00:15:14.511 --> 00:15:15.950
<v Speaker 4>If he was a real efficient.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

329
00:15:28.781 --> 00:15:32.560

<v Speaker 3>imagine sending just a classic street</v>

330
00:15:32.561 --> 00:15:37.561
<v Speaker 3>magician back in time a few thousand</v>
<v Speaker 3>years who can do that stuff in front of</v>

331
00:15:37.931 --> 00:15:41.200
<v Speaker 3>people who haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who still believe that earth is flat,</v>

332
00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:43.030
<v Speaker 3>but he can like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

337
00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:57.640
<v Speaker 4>there's very few people that are alive</v>
<v Speaker 4>today that we can't,</v>

338
00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:02.240
<v Speaker 4>I don't even think we could</v>
<v Speaker 4>intellectualize what life was like back</v>

339
00:16:02.241 --> 00:16:04.460
<v Speaker 4>when no one could read.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>

340
00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:07.040
<v Speaker 4>Well how about like what life was like</v>
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>

341
00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:10.640
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>before the Bible was translated,</v>

342
00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:14.210
<v Speaker 4>when you had to have priests do all the</v>
<v Speaker 4>translating and no one could read it.</v>

343
00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:16.100
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was a real issue.</v>

344
00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:17.630
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you ever see that he listened to that</v>

345
00:16:17.631 --> 00:16:20.300
<v Speaker 4>Dan Carlin podcast on that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

346
00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:22.670
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the rise of,</v>

347
00:16:22.671 --> 00:16:26.360
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lutherism and Martin Luther and Martin</v>

348
00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:29.120
<v Speaker 4>Luther being one of the first guys who</v>
<v Speaker 4>translated it phonetically.</v>

349
00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:31.101
<v Speaker 4>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

350
00:16:31.101 --> 00:16:33.230
<v Speaker 4>when he did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was all sorts of fucking crazy</v>

351
00:16:33.231 --> 00:16:37.550
<v Speaker 4>chaos going on where people were all of</v>
<v Speaker 4>a sudden not needing the priest to</v>

352
00:16:37.551 --> 00:16:40.370
<v Speaker 4>interpret the word of God anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you could read it for yourself.</v>

353
00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:43.180
<v Speaker 4>And not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was saying this was the most blast</v>

354
00:16:43.181 --> 00:16:45.710
<v Speaker 4>from this thing of all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was saying that you could determine</v>

355
00:16:45.711 --> 00:16:48.950
<v Speaker 4>for yourself what God meant in these</v>
<v Speaker 4>passages,</v>

356
00:16:48.951 --> 00:16:50.390
<v Speaker 4>that it was up to like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a,</v>

357
00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:53.570
<v Speaker 4>as a man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could read God's word and determined</v>

358
00:16:53.571 --> 00:16:55.770
<v Speaker 4>through and they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck are you saying?</v>

359
00:16:56.690 --> 00:16:59.780
<v Speaker 4>You're ruining our fucking king.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

360
00:16:59.781 --> 00:17:03.890
<v Speaker 4>can you imagine the Bible was only in a</v>
<v Speaker 4>language that they could read?</v>

361
00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:05.630
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't in German.</v>

362
00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:07.100
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so all of these people,</v>

363
00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:11.990
<v Speaker 4>like under the thumb of this weird thing</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was connected to God.</v>

364
00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:13.241
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we're,</v>

365
00:17:13.241 --> 00:17:14.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're still under it that,</v>

366
00:17:14.590 --> 00:17:15.790
<v Speaker 3>that thumb,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the,</v>

367
00:17:15.791 --> 00:17:20.791
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Bible now is silicide been the Bible</v>

368
00:17:21.011 --> 00:17:23.890
<v Speaker 3>now is lsd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The viable now are all these wonderful</v>

369
00:17:23.891 --> 00:17:28.891
<v Speaker 3>psychedelics that a very small group of</v>
<v Speaker 3>people have controlled for a really long</v>

370
00:17:28.991 --> 00:17:31.060
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when you have a nice psychedelic</v>

371
00:17:31.061 --> 00:17:33.370
<v Speaker 3>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your reading,</v>

372
00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:35.710
<v Speaker 3>the word of God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you ask me,</v>

373
00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:37.390
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the thing where,</v>

374
00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:40.450
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can have a direct connection with</v>

375
00:17:40.451 --> 00:17:42.250
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't need anybody there to</v>

376
00:17:42.251 --> 00:17:45.850
<v Speaker 3>interpret or translate it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just have a nice chat with the</v>

377
00:17:45.851 --> 00:17:49.830
<v Speaker 3>universe and there are people who want</v>
<v Speaker 3>to us</v>

378
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:54.180
<v Speaker 1>now for having that conversation in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same way that you could probably get</v>

379
00:17:54.181 --> 00:17:58.950
<v Speaker 1>arrested at some point for have reading</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Bible or you could worse than that,</v>

380
00:17:58.951 --> 00:18:02.280
<v Speaker 1>you get murdered for it if you didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you didn't have the right</v>

381
00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:04.770
<v Speaker 1>credentials,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you hadn't gone through the right</v>

382
00:18:04.771 --> 00:18:06.960
<v Speaker 1>initiation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

383
00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:09.420
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It never changes many,</v>

384
00:18:09.421 --> 00:18:12.030
<v Speaker 1>it never changes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anytime there's an information stream,</v>

385
00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:15.690
<v Speaker 1>there's always a group of cons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing everything they can to control it.</v>

386
00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:18.180
<v Speaker 1>Always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so true.</v>

387
00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:20.310
<v Speaker 1>It's so true always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

388
00:18:20.311 --> 00:18:21.390
<v Speaker 1>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will say,</v>

389
00:18:21.391 --> 00:18:22.090
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not,</v>

390
00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:24.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the prohibition on psychedelics is not</v>

391
00:18:24.241 --> 00:18:25.890
<v Speaker 1>what you think hippie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This isn't done.</v>

392
00:18:25.891 --> 00:18:29.760
<v Speaker 1>Because when people take psychedelics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they recognize that there's some major</v>

393
00:18:29.761 --> 00:18:33.390
<v Speaker 1>flaws in the concept of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe it isn't the best thing to</v>

394
00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:36.060
<v Speaker 1>sell your life energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

395
00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:41.090
<v Speaker 1>for the majority of her life to somebody</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make way less money than you deserve</v>

396
00:18:41.131 --> 00:18:42.960
<v Speaker 1>for selling the life energy of a being.</v>

397
00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:45.300
<v Speaker 1>That as far as we know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is completely unique,</v>

398
00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:47.340
<v Speaker 1>at least in this galaxy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If not,</v>

399
00:18:47.341 --> 00:18:49.920
<v Speaker 1>and I mean planets are relatively</v>
<v Speaker 1>unique.</v>

400
00:18:49.921 --> 00:18:53.160
<v Speaker 1>So if you're a being on a planet that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>aware of itself,</v>

401
00:18:53.161 --> 00:18:56.250
<v Speaker 1>you're a pretty special thing as far as</v>
<v Speaker 1>our understanding of the universe goes.</v>

402
00:18:56.251 --> 00:19:00.520
<v Speaker 1>So your life energy per hours actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>super pro,</v>

403
00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:05.070
<v Speaker 1>probably $1 billion an hour is what</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody's life energy is really worth.</v>

404
00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:07.090
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole point is you started taking,</v>

405
00:19:07.091 --> 00:19:08.850
<v Speaker 1>it's a great point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the,</v>

406
00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:13.320
<v Speaker 1>that's the key to life is key to life is</v>
<v Speaker 1>to value your time,</v>

407
00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:15.480
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Acute to life is to value your time and</v>

408
00:19:15.481 --> 00:19:18.420
<v Speaker 1>try as much as you can to direct it</v>
<v Speaker 1>towards things you love.</v>

409
00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:21.370
<v Speaker 1>Being with people you love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing things you love right.</v>

410
00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:25.440
<v Speaker 1>And recognize that the more you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to compromise.</v>

411
00:19:25.441 --> 00:19:29.580
<v Speaker 1>The more you do where you were only</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it for a paycheck or you're only</v>

412
00:19:29.581 --> 00:19:34.020
<v Speaker 1>doing it because you want a play it safe</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you're only doing it for any,</v>

413
00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:36.540
<v Speaker 1>any what it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the negative reason would be.</v>

414
00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:39.150
<v Speaker 1>Anytime you're doing anything like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're wasting time.</v>

415
00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:41.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's wasting the most precious thing you</v>

416
00:19:41.491 --> 00:19:42.420
<v Speaker 1>can have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

417
00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:43.590
<v Speaker 1>Theoretically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

418
00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:47.400
<v Speaker 1>this seems to be a very rare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm this book,</v>

419
00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:49.410
<v Speaker 1>you gotta read this book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bill Bryson,</v>

420
00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:52.370
<v Speaker 1>a brief history of nearly everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when you were talking about</v>

421
00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:53.790
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit Man.</v>

422
00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:55.290
<v Speaker 1>When like his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

423
00:19:55.291 --> 00:19:57.510
<v Speaker 1>he's just very good at taking this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

424
00:19:57.511 --> 00:20:00.200
<v Speaker 1>some pretty dense ideas than writing it</v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

425
00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:01.170
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to prepare to read.</v>

426
00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:02.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to pretend I'm going to read</v>
<v Speaker 1>it or not.</v>

427
00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:03.800
<v Speaker 1>You lie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

428
00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:06.360
<v Speaker 1>you'll read this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This one's history of nearly everything.</v>

429
00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:08.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would put this one.</v>

430
00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:11.940
<v Speaker 1>This is as good as like the archaic</v>
<v Speaker 1>revival or it's not about psychedelics,</v>

431
00:20:11.941 --> 00:20:15.120
<v Speaker 1>but it's is it's psychedelic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just because it's,</v>

432
00:20:15.121 --> 00:20:19.410
<v Speaker 1>he's so good at um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>articulating this shit that's incredibly</v>

433
00:20:19.411 --> 00:20:21.000
<v Speaker 1>difficult to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

434
00:20:21.001 --> 00:20:21.834
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

435
00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:25.230
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gravity,</v>

436
00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:27.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gravity being the of you know what</v>

437
00:20:27.331 --> 00:20:27.900
<v Speaker 1>gravity is.</v>

438
00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:29.610
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what gravity is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not really.</v>

439
00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:33.870
<v Speaker 1>So it makes the earth really sticky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

440
00:20:33.871 --> 00:20:38.871
<v Speaker 1>that's the Martin larger the planet is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more mass the planet has,</v>

441
00:20:39.151 --> 00:20:42.600
<v Speaker 1>the stronger the gravity polos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why the moon is one six.</v>

442
00:20:42.601 --> 00:20:45.810
<v Speaker 1>Earth's gravity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mars is wa it was like one half or one</v>

443
00:20:45.811 --> 00:20:47.380
<v Speaker 1>quarter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was right though.</v>

444
00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:49.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to say right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I know I'm going to say,</v>

445
00:20:49.451 --> 00:20:50.000
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>

446
00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.420
<v Speaker 1>I imagine Mars is less,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's there.</v>

447
00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:55.300
<v Speaker 1>Those are issues like that they have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>deal with when they go into space and</v>

448
00:20:55.301 --> 00:20:58.180
<v Speaker 1>they don't have gravity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their bones get all fucked up.</v>

449
00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:03.100
<v Speaker 1>So what's happening here according now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone out there as a scientist,</v>

450
00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:06.070
<v Speaker 1>I do not think of myself as a scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm wait,</v>

451
00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:08.530
<v Speaker 1>what about that shit you were saying</v>
<v Speaker 1>earlier today?</v>

452
00:21:08.531 --> 00:21:09.310
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on the show.</v>

453
00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:11.980
<v Speaker 1>I was a scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck Bro.</v>

454
00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:12.640
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like it.</v>

455
00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:13.810
<v Speaker 1>Let's get surprise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody.</v>

456
00:21:13.811 --> 00:21:15.820
<v Speaker 1>I just don't want the inevitable like</v>
<v Speaker 1>Schwartz,</v>

457
00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:18.370
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're just talking when he's talking.</v>

458
00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:23.560
<v Speaker 1>So in this book it says that what</v>
<v Speaker 1>gravity is is you get this incredibly</v>

459
00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:29.230
<v Speaker 1>heavy thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think with a lot of mass and the mass</v>

460
00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:34.470
<v Speaker 1>pushes in to the time space continuum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's like they compare it to like</v>

461
00:21:35.741 --> 00:21:40.360
<v Speaker 1>putting a lead ball and a mattress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It creates an indentation and gravity is</v>

462
00:21:40.361 --> 00:21:43.600
<v Speaker 1>actually the indentation and it's in</v>
<v Speaker 1>time space.</v>

463
00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:47.560
<v Speaker 1>And so that's why like if you roll a</v>
<v Speaker 1>ball towards,</v>

464
00:21:47.561 --> 00:21:49.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

465
00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:51.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you put a kettle bell on your</v>

466
00:21:51.491 --> 00:21:54.990
<v Speaker 1>mattress and roll a ball towards it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll start falling towards the kettle</v>

467
00:21:54.991 --> 00:21:56.890
<v Speaker 1>bell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what planets are doing.</v>

468
00:21:56.891 --> 00:22:01.300
<v Speaker 1>They're falling towards or they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>trapped in this sort of indentation</v>

469
00:22:01.301 --> 00:22:02.980
<v Speaker 1>created.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great way of putting it.</v>

470
00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:05.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really small heavyweight in the center</v>

471
00:22:05.861 --> 00:22:09.490
<v Speaker 1>of the mattress and everything's gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>sucked into its wig.</v>

472
00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:11.650
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the most psychedelic thing.</v>

473
00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:12.341
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there it is.</v>

474
00:22:12.341 --> 00:22:12.731
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>

475
00:22:12.731 --> 00:22:13.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Check this out.</v>

476
00:22:13.571 --> 00:22:16.060
<v Speaker 1>This is it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This explains gravity.</v>

477
00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:19.590
<v Speaker 5>I have another object.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It also works spacetime.</v>

478
00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:22.620
<v Speaker 5>They feel that and they're attracted to</v>
<v Speaker 5>each other.</v>

479
00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:26.640
<v Speaker 5>And so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's Einstein's picture of grabbing</v>

480
00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:29.610
<v Speaker 5>objects,</v>
<v Speaker 5>workspace eyes,</v>

481
00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:33.450
<v Speaker 5>feel that curvature and move</v>
<v Speaker 5>accordingly.</v>

482
00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:40.310
<v Speaker 5>And if you have more mass,</v>
<v Speaker 5>more mass,</v>

483
00:22:42.751 --> 00:22:47.320
<v Speaker 5>it's going to fence based spacetime</v>
<v Speaker 5>more.</v>

484
00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:56.120
<v Speaker 1>We're looking at a like a trampoline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's look like a impromptu trampoline</v>

485
00:22:56.121 --> 00:22:59.460
<v Speaker 1>that they've made with it looks like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>tablecloth or something.</v>

486
00:22:59.461 --> 00:23:04.461
<v Speaker 1>We just stretched over this whole a rim</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're dropping things in the</v>

487
00:23:04.521 --> 00:23:06.050
<v Speaker 1>center.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what they're talking about.</v>

488
00:23:06.051 --> 00:23:10.430
<v Speaker 1>This is probably like a little too</v>
<v Speaker 1>visual to really get across at all.</v>

489
00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:13.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's pretty good description.</v>

490
00:23:13.041 --> 00:23:14.840
<v Speaker 1>It's a trampoline with a heavy thing in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the middle.</v>

491
00:23:14.841 --> 00:23:17.360
<v Speaker 1>And this guy's like dropping marbles on</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

492
00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:18.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's showing how everything's</v>

493
00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:22.820
<v Speaker 1>getting sucked into the center and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's gravity visualized and it's,</v>

494
00:23:22.850 --> 00:23:24.440
<v Speaker 1>that's the name of it on Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

495
00:23:24.441 --> 00:23:25.670
<v Speaker 1>Grab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But so,</v>

496
00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:29.730
<v Speaker 1>so all of this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in the introduction price,</v>

497
00:23:29.731 --> 00:23:32.790
<v Speaker 1>it's like he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he said he was on a ship or he's</v>

498
00:23:32.791 --> 00:23:34.910
<v Speaker 1>flying over the ocean and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

499
00:23:34.911 --> 00:23:36.770
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how big the earth is.</v>

500
00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:38.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how much water's in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ocean.</v>

501
00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:42.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how far away the moon is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He realized he didn't know any of this</v>

502
00:23:42.501 --> 00:23:44.990
<v Speaker 1>shit and so he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he started</v>

503
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:50.720
<v Speaker 3>all of these things in interviewing all</v>
<v Speaker 3>of these cosmologist and physicist and</v>

504
00:23:50.721 --> 00:23:54.680
<v Speaker 3>then he took it all and put it in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>really understandable way like he cut</v>

505
00:23:54.681 --> 00:23:59.540
<v Speaker 3>through because a lot of this stuff is</v>
<v Speaker 3>so dense like newtons.</v>

506
00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:05.500
<v Speaker 3>Newton wrote what is considered to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the most famous texts on fit,</v>

507
00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:09.530
<v Speaker 3>I guess physics called the Principia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

508
00:24:09.531 --> 00:24:11.450
<v Speaker 3>You can look it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The principia something,</v>

509
00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:14.540
<v Speaker 3>but he intends intentionally made it</v>
<v Speaker 3>difficult.</v>

510
00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:17.930
<v Speaker 3>It's considered to be bryce and says</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's one of the most difficult books to</v>

511
00:24:17.931 --> 00:24:20.390
<v Speaker 3>read.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he did that because he wanted to</v>

512
00:24:20.391 --> 00:24:24.950
<v Speaker 3>separate the real mathematicians and</v>
<v Speaker 3>scientists from everybody else.</v>

513
00:24:24.951 --> 00:24:28.670
<v Speaker 3>He didn't want normal people to have</v>
<v Speaker 3>access to this information.</v>

514
00:24:28.910 --> 00:24:31.930
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is the philosophy naturalist</v>

515
00:24:31.931 --> 00:24:36.931
<v Speaker 3>Principia Mathematica by Isaac Newton.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That guy was a fucking freak man.</v>

516
00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:38.870
<v Speaker 3>There were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

517
00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:41.120
<v Speaker 3>he was nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were trying to figure out,</v>

518
00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:42.180
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

519
00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:43.011
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh god,</v>

520
00:24:43.011 --> 00:24:45.130
<v Speaker 3>there was some equation that they didn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>understand.</v>

521
00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:46.640
<v Speaker 3>They got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was it?</v>

522
00:24:46.641 --> 00:24:49.880
<v Speaker 3>They were trying to figure out shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

523
00:24:49.881 --> 00:24:51.050
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>back then they're trying to figure out</v>

524
00:24:51.051 --> 00:24:52.430
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How big is the earth?</v>

525
00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:55.640
<v Speaker 3>What is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were trying to figure out what y</v>

526
00:24:55.641 --> 00:24:58.910
<v Speaker 3>planets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the moon moves in the ellipses or</v>

527
00:24:58.911 --> 00:25:02.810
<v Speaker 3>something like the way planets move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so they've been working on this</v>

528
00:25:02.811 --> 00:25:04.340
<v Speaker 3>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Forgive me again,</v>

529
00:25:04.341 --> 00:25:05.360
<v Speaker 3>you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure I'm butchering,</v>

530
00:25:05.361 --> 00:25:07.520
<v Speaker 3>but I'm doing my best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like this,</v>

531
00:25:07.521 --> 00:25:08.354
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

532
00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:12.140
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>famous mathematician goes to see Isaac</v>

533
00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:14.810
<v Speaker 3>Newton and asked him about this problem</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they'd been working on forever.</v>

534
00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:16.160
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yes,</v>

535
00:25:16.161 --> 00:25:20.270
<v Speaker 3>I've already solved it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>what it did.</v>

536
00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:22.250
<v Speaker 3>And then there were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guys like,</v>

537
00:25:22.251 --> 00:25:23.600
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>show it to us and he's like,</v>

538
00:25:23.601 --> 00:25:26.000
<v Speaker 3>no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he goes and he's got stacks and</v>

539
00:25:26.001 --> 00:25:31.001
<v Speaker 3>stacks of paper and he can't find it</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's lost somewhere among his</v>

540
00:25:31.341 --> 00:25:32.090
<v Speaker 3>papers.</v>

541
00:25:32.090 --> 00:25:33.470
<v Speaker 3>But he inevitably find,</v>
<v Speaker 3>found it.</v>

542
00:25:33.471 --> 00:25:35.030
<v Speaker 3>Now here's what's weird about fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>Newton,</v>

543
00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:36.640
<v Speaker 3>aside from the fact that he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

544
00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:37.950
<v Speaker 3>never had sex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

545
00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:38.391
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

546
00:25:38.391 --> 00:25:39.560
<v Speaker 3>he never had sex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

547
00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:42.470
<v Speaker 3>And then do you know that he's studied</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Temple of Solomon?</v>

548
00:25:42.471 --> 00:25:44.600
<v Speaker 3>Did you know he's into that shit?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was into alchemy.</v>

549
00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:47.780
<v Speaker 3>But what did that mean back then back</v>
<v Speaker 3>then?</v>

550
00:25:47.781 --> 00:25:52.220
<v Speaker 3>We now look at it as like old retarded</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit that people did when they were</v>

551
00:25:52.221 --> 00:25:55.700
<v Speaker 3>trying to like make gold out of lead and</v>
<v Speaker 3>use witchcraft to shit like that.</v>

552
00:25:55.850 --> 00:25:57.440
<v Speaker 3>Not Witchcraft,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but no,</v>

553
00:25:57.540 --> 00:26:00.590
<v Speaker 3>I mean an alchemist you think of almost</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a magician,</v>

554
00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:02.000
<v Speaker 3>don't you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

555
00:26:02.001 --> 00:26:04.220
<v Speaker 3>I mean the an alchemist I think of as</v>
<v Speaker 3>early,</v>

556
00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:06.620
<v Speaker 3>it's an early chemist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's another name for chemists.</v>

557
00:26:06.621 --> 00:26:07.910
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of it was bullshit,</v>

558
00:26:07.911 --> 00:26:09.530
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a lot of it was,</v>

559
00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:10.101
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

560
00:26:10.101 --> 00:26:10.970
<v Speaker 3>here's the thing.</v>

561
00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:13.640
<v Speaker 3>This is Newton,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isaac Newton,</v>

562
00:26:13.641 --> 00:26:18.170
<v Speaker 3>one of the most famous minds ever who</v>
<v Speaker 3>discovered all of this shit when he's</v>

563
00:26:18.171 --> 00:26:21.590
<v Speaker 3>surrounded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now what we were talking about earlier,</v>

564
00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:25.700
<v Speaker 3>the liars and people who just make shit</v>
<v Speaker 3>up back then.</v>

565
00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:30.260
<v Speaker 3>You're like Isaac Newton surrounded by</v>
<v Speaker 3>these people who will kill you if you</v>

566
00:26:30.290 --> 00:26:32.960
<v Speaker 3>make the wrong discovery and say it in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the wrong way though.</v>

567
00:26:32.961 --> 00:26:36.560
<v Speaker 3>That's the level of you are surrounded</v>
<v Speaker 3>by idiots on all sides,</v>

568
00:26:36.561 --> 00:26:38.780
<v Speaker 3>like idiots,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unlike any idiot that we've ever</v>

569
00:26:38.781 --> 00:26:40.880
<v Speaker 3>encountered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not their fault that they're</v>

570
00:26:40.881 --> 00:26:42.440
<v Speaker 3>idiots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just don't have the information.</v>

571
00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:47.740
<v Speaker 3>So studying these out chemical texts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're studying this really weird</v>

572
00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:53.210
<v Speaker 3>ancient stuff and from that you come up</v>
<v Speaker 3>with all this stuff that turns out to be</v>

573
00:26:53.521 --> 00:26:55.740
<v Speaker 3>real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Isaac Newton figured something</v>

574
00:26:55.741 --> 00:27:00.000
<v Speaker 3>out studying the Temple of Solomon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it probably added to his,</v>

575
00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:03.720
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding of a math somehow that's</v>

576
00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:08.190
<v Speaker 3>some sacred geometry is in there that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>couldn't possibly hope to understand.</v>

577
00:27:08.191 --> 00:27:09.180
<v Speaker 3>But look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

578
00:27:09.181 --> 00:27:14.160
<v Speaker 3>if this is the guy who like figured out</v>
<v Speaker 3>so many of the things that we still use</v>

579
00:27:14.161 --> 00:27:16.920
<v Speaker 3>today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if he's studying the Temple of Solomon,</v>

580
00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:19.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's something,</v>

581
00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:20.700
<v Speaker 3>there must be something to it.</v>

582
00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:21.780
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at something.</v>

583
00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:23.340
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>In what way?</v>

584
00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:25.080
<v Speaker 2>Like it's Jeanette,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a,</v>

585
00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:27.800
<v Speaker 2>an encoding of information and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>architecture.</v>

586
00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:29.050
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

587
00:27:29.051 --> 00:27:31.150
<v Speaker 3>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like so maybe somewhere in there,</v>

588
00:27:31.151 --> 00:27:31.890
<v Speaker 3>there was some,</v>

589
00:27:31.890 --> 00:27:35.040
<v Speaker 2>well they definitely did that in Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever seen some of the</v>

590
00:27:35.041 --> 00:27:36.660
<v Speaker 2>breakdowns of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

591
00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:38.900
<v Speaker 2>the temples,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the various temples and what they're,</v>

592
00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:40.600
<v Speaker 2>especially the temple of man?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

593
00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:43.650
<v Speaker 2>If you ever seen the breakdowns of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard you talk about it.</v>

594
00:27:43.651 --> 00:27:46.470
<v Speaker 2>I haven't signed on right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Forget me.</v>

595
00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:49.860
<v Speaker 2>John Anthony West is the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're interested in it at all.</v>

596
00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:51.480
<v Speaker 2>He's got this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

597
00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:55.590
<v Speaker 2>series on Egypt called magical Egypt and</v>
<v Speaker 2>apparently he just released magical</v>

598
00:27:55.591 --> 00:27:57.620
<v Speaker 2>Egypt to which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

599
00:27:57.650 --> 00:27:58.483
<v Speaker 2>the guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

600
00:27:58.650 --> 00:28:02.100
<v Speaker 2>he is like one of the most knowledgeable</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys when it comes to the history of</v>

601
00:28:02.101 --> 00:28:02.731
<v Speaker 2>Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

602
00:28:02.731 --> 00:28:06.210
<v Speaker 2>he's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just so engrossed in it that people</v>

603
00:28:06.211 --> 00:28:09.270
<v Speaker 2>don't take them that seriously because</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

604
00:28:09.271 --> 00:28:11.580
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he has a masters or a phd</v>
<v Speaker 2>in it.</v>

605
00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:13.770
<v Speaker 2>I think he's just a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's been obsessed with it.</v>

606
00:28:13.771 --> 00:28:15.240
<v Speaker 2>So he's been studying it forever.</v>

607
00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:18.060
<v Speaker 2>But he knows so much about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you,</v>

608
00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:23.100
<v Speaker 2>when you're watching what he's saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>along with just the videos of the</v>

609
00:28:23.101 --> 00:28:26.040
<v Speaker 2>temples,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where he's describing all the different</v>

610
00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:29.790
<v Speaker 2>types of art work and the way they</v>
<v Speaker 2>constructed it and how,</v>

611
00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:32.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's basically just constructed</v>

612
00:28:32.341 --> 00:28:36.360
<v Speaker 2>around the FIBONACCI sequence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the entire building is mathematic.</v>

613
00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:41.370
<v Speaker 2>We sequenced the same way like a human</v>
<v Speaker 2>body as like the proportions of the</v>

614
00:28:41.371 --> 00:28:42.540
<v Speaker 2>human body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

615
00:28:42.690 --> 00:28:46.860
<v Speaker 2>It's really fucking intense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they were so fucking smart,</v>

616
00:28:46.890 --> 00:28:51.360
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think it's almost in the evidence</v>

617
00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:56.720
<v Speaker 2>of how incredibly smart they were to</v>
<v Speaker 2>build these just insane buildings that</v>

618
00:28:58.201 --> 00:29:02.540
<v Speaker 2>are still insane today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they did them 2,500 years BC.</v>

619
00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:03.121
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

620
00:29:03.121 --> 00:29:05.250
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>

<v Speaker 2>the temple of Giza?</v>

625
00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:15.810
<v Speaker 2>How are they the same people that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>about to elect Donald Trump?</v>

626
00:29:15.970 --> 00:29:16.800
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

<v Speaker 2>frequencies and the rest just eat their</v>

631
00:29:27.361 --> 00:29:29.080
<v Speaker 2>ankles while they're fucking trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>climb them?</v>

<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you why.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you why.</v>

652
00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:20.530
<v Speaker 4>Because these assholes don't know how to</v>
<v Speaker 4>take care of them.</v>

653
00:30:20.650 --> 00:30:23.800
<v Speaker 4>Bring them to America.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where people loved on monkeys will take</v>

654
00:30:23.801 --> 00:30:25.540
<v Speaker 4>care of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll breed them like crazy.</v>

655
00:30:25.541 --> 00:30:30.400
<v Speaker 4>We'll give them all protein powder and</v>
<v Speaker 4>save the thumb monkey.</v>

656
00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:31.990
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll give him vitamins and shit.</v>

00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:32.853
<v Speaker 4>Let's do a bed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mom.</v>

658
00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:34.720

<v Speaker 4>Oh we have to do is get them to fuck.</v>

660
00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:41.290
<v Speaker 4>We create like a gigantic thumb monkey</v>
<v Speaker 4>paradise.</v>

661
00:30:41.490 --> 00:30:43.780
<v Speaker 4>Look animals you have to do,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

663
00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:48.370
<v Speaker 4>That's just what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All you have to do is just get them</v>

664
00:30:48.371 --> 00:30:50.070
<v Speaker 4>chilled out and they'll fuck the shit</v>
<v Speaker 4>out of me.</v>

665
00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:54.040
<v Speaker 4>You could watch hours of thumb monkeys</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking but they fuck only in the mouth.</v>

666
00:30:54.041 --> 00:30:56.380
<v Speaker 4>That's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But so few of them like,</v>

667
00:30:56.381 --> 00:30:59.230
<v Speaker 4>Hey assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You keep fucking each other in the</v>

668
00:30:59.231 --> 00:31:00.830
<v Speaker 4>mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why there's only 10 of you.</v>

669
00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:05.320
<v Speaker 4>You got to stick it in her pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's something about thumb monkey</v>

670
00:31:05.321 --> 00:31:08.200
<v Speaker 4>pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's rotten and they don't just hang on</v>

671
00:31:08.201 --> 00:31:10.480
<v Speaker 4>your thumb guaranteed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what we're going to have to do is</v>

672
00:31:10.481 --> 00:31:14.110
<v Speaker 4>we're going to go let go in there and</v>
<v Speaker 4>jerk him off and get little vials of</v>

673
00:31:14.111 --> 00:31:14.350
<v Speaker 4>thumb.</v>

674
00:31:14.350 --> 00:31:17.830
<v Speaker 4>Monkey calm and just starts court and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then the females shirk off the thumb</v>

675
00:31:17.831 --> 00:31:18.371
<v Speaker 4>monkeys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

676
00:31:18.371 --> 00:31:21.760
<v Speaker 4>That's the only way we can use them as</v>
<v Speaker 4>pets.</v>

677
00:31:22.030 --> 00:31:24.580
<v Speaker 4>Yeah Man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been jerking off thumb monkeys all</v>

678
00:31:24.581 --> 00:31:25.870
<v Speaker 4>day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm exhausted.</v>

679
00:31:25.930 --> 00:31:28.210
<v Speaker 4>And then some people are going to find</v>
<v Speaker 4>out how delicious they are and then</v>

680
00:31:28.211 --> 00:31:30.250
<v Speaker 4>we're going to have a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Perhaps people are going to be eating</v>

681
00:31:30.251 --> 00:31:31.750
<v Speaker 4>thumb monkeys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They like,</v>

682
00:31:31.751 --> 00:31:35.230
<v Speaker 4>they like give you a little more energy</v>
<v Speaker 4>or they like the making young.</v>

683
00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:37.210
<v Speaker 4>What if they found out they gave you a</v>
<v Speaker 4>six pack?</v>

684
00:31:37.211 --> 00:31:39.100
<v Speaker 4>Eight a thumb monkey.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just an inch bigger.</v>

685
00:31:39.101 --> 00:31:42.370
<v Speaker 4>Every time you you're more fun monkeys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No more thumb.</v>

686
00:31:42.371 --> 00:31:45.550
<v Speaker 4>Mcgee's it'd be swarms if humans to</v>
<v Speaker 4>sending,</v>

687
00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:50.230
<v Speaker 4>it'd be like that bit that I used to</v>
<v Speaker 4>have a big dick pills.</v>

688
00:31:51.610 --> 00:31:55.000
<v Speaker 4>People will be coming out of the thumb</v>
<v Speaker 4>monkey forest or their mouth covered in</v>

689
00:31:55.001 --> 00:31:57.640
<v Speaker 4>blood and fern,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's one thing to like,</v>

690
00:31:57.641 --> 00:32:01.960
<v Speaker 4>we would not let you eat fellow primates</v>
<v Speaker 4>that we have rules in this country.</v>

691
00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:04.600
<v Speaker 4>At least if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you,</v>

692
00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:05.650
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you can eat,</v>

693
00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:08.110
<v Speaker 4>if you could prove that a pig as smarter</v>
<v Speaker 4>than a thumb monkey.</v>

694
00:32:08.140 --> 00:32:12.100
<v Speaker 4>And it might be still okay to eat pigs</v>
<v Speaker 4>not attending your thumb monkey.</v>

695
00:32:12.101 --> 00:32:14.460
<v Speaker 4>Even if it's stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's something about the little look</v>

696
00:32:14.461 --> 00:32:15.790
<v Speaker 4>on his face when you go to grab it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

697
00:32:15.791 --> 00:32:17.020
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

698
00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:19.290
<v Speaker 4>If you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't eat your own Chi,</v>

699
00:32:19.291 --> 00:32:21.430
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He keeps not even our own kind,</v>

700
00:32:21.431 --> 00:32:22.241
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

701
00:32:22.241 --> 00:32:24.250
<v Speaker 4>it looks close enough to close.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

702
00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:25.720
<v Speaker 4>That's pretty close.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's too close.</v>

703
00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:26.860
<v Speaker 4>Close.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

704
00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:27.761
<v Speaker 4>but the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

705
00:32:27.761 --> 00:32:32.761
<v Speaker 4>if you get that happening right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then why wouldn't it happen with</v>

706
00:32:33.131 --> 00:32:36.820
<v Speaker 4>humans that like some humans are going</v>
<v Speaker 4>to divert,</v>

707
00:32:36.821 --> 00:32:40.310
<v Speaker 4>some humans are going to vote for trump.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some humans want to hear Isaac</v>

708
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:43.370
<v Speaker 3>fucking Newton talking about his goddamn</v>
<v Speaker 3>bullshit.</v>

709
00:32:43.570 --> 00:32:46.670
<v Speaker 3>It's like sending in those humans</v>
<v Speaker 3>usually are really violent and that's</v>

710
00:32:46.671 --> 00:32:51.620
<v Speaker 3>why people like Isaac Newton end up</v>
<v Speaker 3>becoming very relatively reclusive.</v>

711
00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:55.940
<v Speaker 3>They don't want to deal with these.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're constantly dealing with people</v>

712
00:32:56.150 --> 00:33:00.380
<v Speaker 3>who are idiots like idiots and who are</v>
<v Speaker 3>idiots.</v>

713
00:33:00.381 --> 00:33:04.850
<v Speaker 3>It though like I'm an idiot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if someone corrects me and it seems</v>

714
00:33:04.851 --> 00:33:08.630
<v Speaker 3>undeniable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I'll refine your completely</v>

715
00:33:08.631 --> 00:33:11.620
<v Speaker 3>different kind of idiot than an idiot</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the 1400 right?</v>

716
00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:12.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a different idea,</v>

717
00:33:12.650 --> 00:33:15.560
<v Speaker 3>like these idiots are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they will kill you,</v>

718
00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:18.470
<v Speaker 3>they will imprison you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they will incinerate you.</v>

719
00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:19.453
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

720
00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:20.120
<v Speaker 6>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're in nature,</v>

721
00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:21.350
<v Speaker 6>we're idiots.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're both idiots.</v>

722
00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:23.900
<v Speaker 6>We're idiots in the age of information,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

723
00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:28.960
<v Speaker 6>Like we're so much more informed today.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Even the dumb amongst us than anyone</v>

724
00:33:29.481 --> 00:33:32.330
<v Speaker 6>that's ever lived there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Any civilization ever.</v>

725
00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:35.060
<v Speaker 6>If even the really brilliant people you</v>
<v Speaker 6>go to,</v>

726
00:33:35.061 --> 00:33:40.010
<v Speaker 6>like you know Thomas Edison or someone,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you had Thomas Edison alive today,</v>

727
00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:44.930
<v Speaker 6>he would know Jack Shit about the way</v>
<v Speaker 6>this world works because there's too</v>

728
00:33:44.931 --> 00:33:49.790
<v Speaker 6>much information that doesn't apply like</v>
<v Speaker 6>the you need today,</v>

729
00:33:49.850 --> 00:33:52.940
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>That he just didn't have that few weeks.</v>

730
00:33:53.270 --> 00:33:55.100
<v Speaker 6>He'd have a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it wouldn't be a long time before he</v>

731
00:33:55.101 --> 00:33:56.810
<v Speaker 6>totally understood what the fuck was</v>
<v Speaker 6>going on.</v>

732
00:33:56.930 --> 00:34:01.640
<v Speaker 6>But my point being that you're talking</v>
<v Speaker 6>about people that were the most informed</v>

733
00:34:01.641 --> 00:34:06.590
<v Speaker 6>people in the world during their time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The regular person today is way more</v>

734
00:34:06.591 --> 00:34:08.960
<v Speaker 6>informed than them on so many different</v>
<v Speaker 6>things.</v>

735
00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:12.050
<v Speaker 6>Even if it's just instantaneously by</v>
<v Speaker 6>being connected to Google.</v>

736
00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:17.120
<v Speaker 6>If they have the will to check.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's more information now today than</v>

737
00:34:17.121 --> 00:34:21.350
<v Speaker 6>your average dumb ass can just grab a</v>
<v Speaker 6>hold of it and use it for an argument</v>

738
00:34:21.351 --> 00:34:22.810
<v Speaker 6>more an instant.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

739
00:34:22.811 --> 00:34:24.440
<v Speaker 6>Then anybody that's ever live.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

740
00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:27.110
<v Speaker 6>So all of these people that knew who is</v>
<v Speaker 6>dealing with,</v>

741
00:34:27.470 --> 00:34:30.680
<v Speaker 6>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how many of them even could read,</v>

742
00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:31.640
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How many,</v>

743
00:34:31.641 --> 00:34:36.260
<v Speaker 6>how many of them just believe the most</v>
<v Speaker 6>unbelievably retarded shit and thought</v>

744
00:34:36.261 --> 00:34:38.060
<v Speaker 6>there were demons waiting for him in the</v>
<v Speaker 6>woods.</v>

745
00:34:38.061 --> 00:34:40.430
<v Speaker 6>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And thought that they had to do the will</v>

746
00:34:40.431 --> 00:34:43.190
<v Speaker 6>of God.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Otherwise the apocalypse did sue and</v>

747
00:34:43.191 --> 00:34:47.390
<v Speaker 6>they have to lock up Galileo and make</v>
<v Speaker 6>sure he doesn't tell everybody that the</v>

748
00:34:47.391 --> 00:34:49.520
<v Speaker 6>earth isn't the center of the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

749
00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:50.690
<v Speaker 6>Most of them,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

750
00:34:50.990 --> 00:34:54.750
<v Speaker 6>those guys get through when we're</v>
<v Speaker 6>complaining about a tweet or,</v>

751
00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:57.020
<v Speaker 6>oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I got so much fucking hate for this</v>

752
00:34:57.021 --> 00:34:57.640
<v Speaker 6>tweet.</v>

753
00:34:57.640 --> 00:34:58.970
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

754
00:34:59.210 --> 00:35:04.210
<v Speaker 6>Galileo got locked up for being right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They put him in the house arrest.</v>

755
00:35:04.610 --> 00:35:08.570
<v Speaker 6>What are the most brilliant astronomers</v>
<v Speaker 6>and when the most important people in</v>

756
00:35:08.571 --> 00:35:12.230
<v Speaker 6>the world at the time for,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and maybe even ever when it comes to</v>

757
00:35:12.231 --> 00:35:15.890
<v Speaker 6>getting the people to try to understand</v>
<v Speaker 6>the perspective of what we're dealing</v>

758
00:35:15.891 --> 00:35:17.630
<v Speaker 6>with when we're looking up into the</v>
<v Speaker 6>heavens,</v>

759
00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:19.900
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>That it's very possible that you're</v>

760
00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:22.760
<v Speaker 6>looking at something that absolutely</v>
<v Speaker 6>doesn't have an end,</v>

761
00:35:22.850 --> 00:35:25.190
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This isn't something we can define and</v>

762
00:35:25.191 --> 00:35:30.191
<v Speaker 6>it's proof positive that the pettiness</v>
<v Speaker 6>and nonsense that we wrestle with on a</v>

763
00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:35.440
<v Speaker 6>day to day basis is a fucking fantastic</v>
<v Speaker 6>distraction from the eternity above our</v>

764
00:35:36.471 --> 00:35:38.070
<v Speaker 6>heads at any given moment.</v>

765
00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:42.060
<v Speaker 3>And this attorney that you're trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>attach to a book that was clearly</v>

766
00:35:42.061 --> 00:35:45.270
<v Speaker 3>written by people even fucking dumber</v>
<v Speaker 3>than us,</v>

767
00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:49.200
<v Speaker 3>even less informed in us with less</v>
<v Speaker 3>information,</v>

768
00:35:49.290 --> 00:35:50.670
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>More scared.</v>

769
00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:53.550
<v Speaker 3>The oldest guy in the fucking tribe was</v>
<v Speaker 3>19 right?</v>

770
00:35:53.730 --> 00:35:58.530
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's dead by the time they're 30</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody's got gang green and malaria.</v>

771
00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:02.940
<v Speaker 3>But you got to got eaten by a crocodile</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you got to distinguish though</v>

772
00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:07.470
<v Speaker 3>information from navigation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

773
00:36:07.471 --> 00:36:08.850
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's like you're,</v>

774
00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:12.930
<v Speaker 3>you're in this dimension that you've got</v>
<v Speaker 3>to navigate through for a certain period</v>

775
00:36:12.931 --> 00:36:17.931
<v Speaker 3>of time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the Bible or the Torah or whatever</v>

776
00:36:18.451 --> 00:36:21.120
<v Speaker 3>their religious scripture is that you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at,</v>

777
00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:27.660
<v Speaker 3>it is the data in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As far as the age of the earth where</v>

778
00:36:28.081 --> 00:36:31.710
<v Speaker 3>things came from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of that data is obviously</v>

779
00:36:31.711 --> 00:36:34.560
<v Speaker 3>completely fucking wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could see how someone think of it.</v>

780
00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:36.150
<v Speaker 3>It's like what a six year old might</v>
<v Speaker 3>think.</v>

781
00:36:36.690 --> 00:36:39.030
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you could see a young version of</v>

782
00:36:39.031 --> 00:36:41.130
<v Speaker 3>humanity would think these things that</v>
<v Speaker 3>makes sense,</v>

783
00:36:41.131 --> 00:36:46.131
<v Speaker 3>but with like encased within all that</v>
<v Speaker 3>bad data or some pretty great</v>

784
00:36:47.281 --> 00:36:51.810
<v Speaker 3>navigational tips.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's so you gotta be able to Unpeel</v>

785
00:36:51.811 --> 00:36:54.960
<v Speaker 3>all the bad information and look deeper</v>
<v Speaker 3>and see if there's anything in there</v>

786
00:36:54.961 --> 00:36:56.480
<v Speaker 3>that is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause that,</v>

787
00:36:56.550 --> 00:37:00.840
<v Speaker 3>cause when you were talking about uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not Newton who has it,</v>

788
00:37:00.841 --> 00:37:03.330
<v Speaker 3>a Galileo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we brought him back here,</v>

789
00:37:03.331 --> 00:37:05.200
<v Speaker 3>you would be confused on the set of Tom</v>
<v Speaker 3>Setting.</v>

790
00:37:05.250 --> 00:37:08.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think a lot of these people have</v>

791
00:37:08.191 --> 00:37:13.191
<v Speaker 3>developed a navigational techniques that</v>
<v Speaker 3>would work or did you would adapt,</v>

792
00:37:14.130 --> 00:37:15.990
<v Speaker 3>should adapt quick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what's important.</v>

793
00:37:15.991 --> 00:37:17.690
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter how much data you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting,</v>

794
00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:18.743
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

795
00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:21.630
<v Speaker 3>this is what I love about archery is</v>
<v Speaker 3>that archery,</v>

796
00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:24.450
<v Speaker 3>your dealing with data,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

797
00:37:24.451 --> 00:37:27.210
<v Speaker 3>You're dealing with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so every time you fire an arrow,</v>

798
00:37:27.450 --> 00:37:30.900
<v Speaker 3>you get an instantaneous feedback from</v>
<v Speaker 3>the target.</v>

799
00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:31.321
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

800
00:37:31.321 --> 00:37:32.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's where I'm off.</v>

801
00:37:32.791 --> 00:37:35.340
<v Speaker 3>No question about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No arguing about it.</v>

802
00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:38.940
<v Speaker 3>No matter how that is not the bullseye.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I can clearly see that's not the</v>

803
00:37:38.941 --> 00:37:41.430
<v Speaker 3>bullseye.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so then you make adjustments,</v>

804
00:37:41.431 --> 00:37:42.211
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

805
00:37:42.211 --> 00:37:43.980
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if I just move a little bit to the</v>

806
00:37:43.981 --> 00:37:47.070
<v Speaker 3>left that maybe I'll get closer to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>bullseye.</v>

807
00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:50.310
<v Speaker 3>And I've noticed with archery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my ego,</v>

808
00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:54.510
<v Speaker 3>even when I will have me shoot the</v>
<v Speaker 3>heroin the exact same way,</v>

809
00:37:54.511 --> 00:37:56.580
<v Speaker 3>even though I'm still off the fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>target,</v>

810
00:37:56.610 --> 00:37:57.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just say no,</v>

811
00:37:57.941 --> 00:37:58.231
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

812
00:37:58.231 --> 00:38:01.680
<v Speaker 3>you were right at the Arrow was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how the brain works.</v>

813
00:38:01.681 --> 00:38:03.360
<v Speaker 3>Like it fell right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just keep doing it.</v>

814
00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:04.590
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

815
00:38:05.070 --> 00:38:07.320
<v Speaker 3>so you've got to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though the feedback from the</v>

816
00:38:07.321 --> 00:38:08.520
<v Speaker 3>universe is like nope,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong,</v>

817
00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:10.440
<v Speaker 3>don't take that approach to bud fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>ever.</v>

818
00:38:11.470 --> 00:38:15.360
<v Speaker 3>You hurt somebody hurt somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stop screaming,</v>

819
00:38:15.361 --> 00:38:17.160
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing it right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

820
00:38:17.161 --> 00:38:18.780
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

821
00:38:19.050 --> 00:38:24.050
<v Speaker 3>But think of it man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I certainly am in my life have erred</v>

822
00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:30.480
<v Speaker 3>by choosing my instinct over the</v>
<v Speaker 3>feedback I'm getting from the universe</v>

823
00:38:30.481 --> 00:38:33.000
<v Speaker 3>because I want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so because of that self sabotage,</v>

824
00:38:33.001 --> 00:38:35.830
<v Speaker 3>self sabotage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then that mean</v>

825
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:39.040
<v Speaker 6>you are not,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're not a terrible person with that.</v>

826
00:38:39.041 --> 00:38:40.870
<v Speaker 6>You don't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you don't have giant problems with that.</v>

827
00:38:40.871 --> 00:38:45.310
<v Speaker 6>But you are like a lot of other</v>
<v Speaker 6>impulsive artists and that you're kind</v>

828
00:38:45.311 --> 00:38:48.460
<v Speaker 6>of drawn towards that sometimes when you</v>
<v Speaker 6>don't have structure,</v>

829
00:38:48.850 --> 00:38:51.500
<v Speaker 6>you can get chaotic with your freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

830
00:38:51.610 --> 00:38:54.130
<v Speaker 6>And sometimes your,</v>
<v Speaker 6>your freedom becomes a prison.</v>

831
00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:56.980
<v Speaker 6>And a lot of ways because you don't</v>
<v Speaker 6>discipline yourself and you don't</v>

832
00:38:56.981 --> 00:38:59.440
<v Speaker 6>necessarily have to write because you're</v>
<v Speaker 6>a comedian.</v>

833
00:38:59.441 --> 00:39:02.400
<v Speaker 6>So a I fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't have anything to do to that.</v>

834
00:39:02.410 --> 00:39:03.610
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then you're in front of that</v>

835
00:39:03.611 --> 00:39:06.700
<v Speaker 6>computer and that game is there and you</v>
<v Speaker 6>just can get sucked into it.</v>

836
00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:09.580
<v Speaker 6>Whereas a normal person with a normal</v>
<v Speaker 6>life is like,</v>

837
00:39:09.581 --> 00:39:11.710
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I got shit I have to do in the morning.</v>

838
00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:13.350
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well this is like that right</v>

839
00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:16.070
<v Speaker 3>book that you introduced me to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I war of art.</v>

840
00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:18.170
<v Speaker 3>Now the book of five rings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

841
00:39:18.171 --> 00:39:21.470
<v Speaker 3>the real ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the one that talks about how uh,</v>

842
00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:24.350
<v Speaker 3>you should just learn anything like get</v>
<v Speaker 3>good at anything.</v>

843
00:39:24.351 --> 00:39:26.300
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter what the thing is that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're getting good at.</v>

844
00:39:26.301 --> 00:39:28.760
<v Speaker 3>Because if you understand how to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>good at this one thing,</v>

845
00:39:29.090 --> 00:39:32.660
<v Speaker 3>you can extrapolate from that how to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>good at almost anything.</v>

846
00:39:32.690 --> 00:39:34.610
<v Speaker 3>There's these recurring patterns that</v>
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>

847
00:39:34.970 --> 00:39:39.170
<v Speaker 3>And so with archery it's really cool</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you have to find these,</v>

848
00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:43.640
<v Speaker 3>you have to keep all these variables the</v>
<v Speaker 3>same no matter what your environment,</v>

849
00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:47.150
<v Speaker 3>if you can learn to keep these variables</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same if you're on a hill,</v>

850
00:39:47.151 --> 00:39:50.060
<v Speaker 3>the distance when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

851
00:39:50.061 --> 00:39:52.490
<v Speaker 3>if you can learn how to hold these</v>
<v Speaker 3>variables the same,</v>

852
00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:56.480
<v Speaker 3>which is the anchor point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way your arm holds the bow,</v>

853
00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:59.620
<v Speaker 3>the way you pull the Arrow back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way you release the air,</v>

854
00:39:59.630 --> 00:40:04.520
<v Speaker 3>there's all these pieces in there and if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can keep all of those the same or</v>

855
00:40:04.521 --> 00:40:08.390
<v Speaker 3>close to the same with adjustments based</v>
<v Speaker 3>on whatever your target app is to be,</v>

856
00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:12.980
<v Speaker 3>then you're going to improve in your</v>
<v Speaker 3>accurate accuracy.</v>

857
00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:16.940
<v Speaker 3>If you keep changing your variable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you keep moving your arm up or down</v>

858
00:40:16.941 --> 00:40:19.220
<v Speaker 3>or like releasing in a different way or</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

859
00:40:19.221 --> 00:40:20.900
<v Speaker 3>if any of these things are always</v>
<v Speaker 3>changing,</v>

860
00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:26.230
<v Speaker 3>you won't be as accurate over time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So from that you can grab that and look</v>

861
00:40:26.961 --> 00:40:29.420
<v Speaker 3>at your life and realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh shit man,</v>

862
00:40:29.421 --> 00:40:31.940
<v Speaker 3>my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've just been readjusting all these</v>

863
00:40:31.941 --> 00:40:36.941
<v Speaker 3>stupid variables over and over and over</v>
<v Speaker 3>again without just for at least a month,</v>

864
00:40:38.090 --> 00:40:42.110
<v Speaker 3>attempting some rhythmic patterns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some similar thing,</v>

865
00:40:42.111 --> 00:40:43.940
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you start doing that,</v>

866
00:40:43.941 --> 00:40:47.180
<v Speaker 3>it's really interesting because you</v>
<v Speaker 3>begin to,</v>

867
00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:51.350
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>improve in a lot of an in everything in</v>

868
00:40:51.351 --> 00:40:52.101
<v Speaker 3>general,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

869
00:40:52.101 --> 00:40:53.180
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

870
00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:55.610
<v Speaker 3>So to me it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think these people like Newton,</v>

871
00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:01.000
<v Speaker 3>I think the great people of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they discovered this very specific</v>

872
00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:06.050
<v Speaker 3>pattern that if you apply yourself to</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

873
00:41:06.590 --> 00:41:08.870
<v Speaker 3>then you will begin to flourish.</v>

874
00:41:08.930 --> 00:41:12.980
<v Speaker 3>And that pattern is written about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in most scriptures,</v>

875
00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:18.340
<v Speaker 3>it's probably somehow hidden in the god</v>
<v Speaker 3>Damn Temple of solid and diagrams.</v>

876
00:41:19.041 --> 00:41:21.070
<v Speaker 3>It's probably in there somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

877
00:41:21.071 --> 00:41:26.071
<v Speaker 3>it must be in there because people walk</v>
<v Speaker 3>through the world and the way that fish</v>

878
00:41:27.411 --> 00:41:28.400
<v Speaker 3>swim,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

879
00:41:28.401 --> 00:41:33.080
<v Speaker 3>And so the smart people must have</v>
<v Speaker 3>figured out the best way to navigate in</v>

880
00:41:33.110 --> 00:41:37.250
<v Speaker 3>this dimension or cardless of your</v>
<v Speaker 3>surroundings or settings or situation</v>

881
00:41:37.251 --> 00:41:39.290
<v Speaker 3>that can be handled by adjustment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

882
00:41:39.291 --> 00:41:42.320
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love to believe that there are hidden,</v>

883
00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:46.310
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>methodologies that some of the great</v>

884
00:41:46.311 --> 00:41:49.610
<v Speaker 3>people of the world have adopted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And for whatever reason,</v>

885
00:41:49.611 --> 00:41:52.280
<v Speaker 3>keep kind of secret.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't talk about it for some</v>

886
00:41:52.281 --> 00:41:53.031
<v Speaker 3>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

887
00:41:53.031 --> 00:41:55.730
<v Speaker 3>they don't share it with everybody or</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't say,</v>

888
00:41:55.731 --> 00:41:57.380
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is why I figured this shit out.</v>

889
00:41:57.381 --> 00:41:59.780
<v Speaker 3>Here's how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not just the discovery I'm</v>

890
00:41:59.781 --> 00:42:02.090
<v Speaker 3>interested in with Newton.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

891
00:42:02.091 --> 00:42:03.170
<v Speaker 3>what were you doing?</v>

892
00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:06.410
<v Speaker 3>What were you doing all day long?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck are you doing?</v>

893
00:42:06.411 --> 00:42:08.390
<v Speaker 3>We don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>except the fact that when they took his</v>

894
00:42:08.391 --> 00:42:10.580
<v Speaker 3>hair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a sample of his hair,</v>

895
00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:16.150
<v Speaker 3>it was filled with fucking mercury man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that guy was like in some laboratory</v>

896
00:42:17.690 --> 00:42:19.210
<v Speaker 3>with mercury,</v>
<v Speaker 3>quick,</v>

897
00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:21.380
<v Speaker 3>quick silver,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

898
00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:25.520
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like old scrolls with the temple of</v>

899
00:42:25.521 --> 00:42:28.700
<v Speaker 3>Solomon on it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like staring at it and then dripping</v>

900
00:42:28.701 --> 00:42:32.420
<v Speaker 3>mercury through test tubes to try to</v>
<v Speaker 3>transform,</v>

901
00:42:32.421 --> 00:42:34.910
<v Speaker 3>lead into gold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was he doing?</v>

902
00:42:34.911 --> 00:42:37.340
<v Speaker 3>We'll never fucking know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll never know.</v>

903
00:42:37.341 --> 00:42:41.380
<v Speaker 3>And how many more people are doing that</v>
<v Speaker 3>now that we don't even know about says</v>

904
00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:43.940
<v Speaker 3>is hidden away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you're doing it electronically now.</v>

905
00:42:44.050 --> 00:42:45.140
<v Speaker 3>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

906
00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:47.240
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

907
00:42:47.241 --> 00:42:48.200
<v Speaker 3>They're doing it like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

908
00:42:48.201 --> 00:42:49.430
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because they're trying to bring</v>

909
00:42:49.431 --> 00:42:50.400
<v Speaker 3>computers to lie.</v>

910
00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:55.750
<v Speaker 2>That's the real alchemy now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you think about what they knew</v>

911
00:42:55.751 --> 00:42:58.780
<v Speaker 2>back then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you think about Isaac Newton in</v>

912
00:42:58.781 --> 00:43:02.930
<v Speaker 2>that time period and what he knew as</v>
<v Speaker 2>opposed to what everybody else doing and</v>

913
00:43:03.130 --> 00:43:07.210
<v Speaker 2>like being able to establish something</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a theory about gravity and being</v>

914
00:43:07.211 --> 00:43:10.780
<v Speaker 2>able to try to explain this to people</v>
<v Speaker 2>during that time,</v>

915
00:43:12.610 --> 00:43:17.080
<v Speaker 2>who knew what was legit and what wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like when he was looking at Alchemy,</v>

916
00:43:17.081 --> 00:43:19.600
<v Speaker 2>he might've been thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's probably something to this.</v>

917
00:43:19.601 --> 00:43:21.130
<v Speaker 2>It's just these guys haven't figured it</v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

918
00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:23.200
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What people forgot it or no one knows</v>

919
00:43:23.201 --> 00:43:25.060
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it only makes sense if things are</v>

920
00:43:25.061 --> 00:43:28.630
<v Speaker 2>made out of elements that you could</v>
<v Speaker 2>perhaps combine these elements and make</v>

921
00:43:28.631 --> 00:43:30.610
<v Speaker 2>something different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could train me.</v>

922
00:43:30.730 --> 00:43:32.740
<v Speaker 2>They didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't have like a table of</v>

923
00:43:32.741 --> 00:43:34.840
<v Speaker 2>elements back then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't know what all the different</v>

924
00:43:34.841 --> 00:43:35.910
<v Speaker 2>elements were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

925
00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:39.010
<v Speaker 2>What year did they develop the table of</v>
<v Speaker 2>elements?</v>

926
00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:44.220
<v Speaker 2>That's a really important question</v>
<v Speaker 2>because those elements are essentially</v>

927
00:43:45.251 --> 00:43:48.160
<v Speaker 2>what we've been able to measure in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>universe.</v>

928
00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:49.353
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

929
00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:54.750
<v Speaker 2>And then things like the large Hadron,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which just finally figured out some</v>

930
00:43:55.661 --> 00:43:57.430
<v Speaker 2>stuff that we couldn't measure before.</v>

931
00:43:57.490 --> 00:43:57.971
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

932
00:43:57.971 --> 00:44:01.240
<v Speaker 3>it's launching protons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're shooting protons.</v>

933
00:44:01.241 --> 00:44:04.900
<v Speaker 3>Thank God I just listened to this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're blasting a proton just</v>

934
00:44:04.901 --> 00:44:07.810
<v Speaker 3>under the speed of light.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They collide with each other and they're</v>

935
00:44:07.811 --> 00:44:09.180
<v Speaker 3>trying to make an error.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Leases.</v>

936
00:44:09.190 --> 00:44:10.660
<v Speaker 3>They shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

937
00:44:10.661 --> 00:44:13.630
<v Speaker 3>It's the one missing little piece.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like they don't understand</v>

938
00:44:13.631 --> 00:44:16.200
<v Speaker 3>something about how things get their</v>
<v Speaker 3>density and,</v>

939
00:44:16.201 --> 00:44:19.030
<v Speaker 3>and so if you could figure that out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll make sense down there.</v>

940
00:44:19.031 --> 00:44:20.470
<v Speaker 3>It gets weird down there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

941
00:44:20.471 --> 00:44:23.310
<v Speaker 3>It gets very weird down there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's a,</v>

942
00:44:23.311 --> 00:44:24.970
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's quite confusing.</v>

943
00:44:25.150 --> 00:44:25.601
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

944
00:44:25.601 --> 00:44:28.750
<v Speaker 2>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Periodic table 1863,</v>

945
00:44:28.751 --> 00:44:30.680
<v Speaker 2>is that what it says?</v>
<v Speaker 2>In 1863,</v>

946
00:44:30.681 --> 00:44:32.040
<v Speaker 2>there are 50 known elements</v>

947
00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:36.120
<v Speaker 4>with a new element being discovered at a</v>
<v Speaker 4>rate of approximately one a year.</v>

948
00:44:36.121 --> 00:44:37.260
<v Speaker 4>Other scientists pump up blah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>

949
00:44:37.261 --> 00:44:39.090
<v Speaker 4>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

950
00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:44.150
<v Speaker 4>looks like they did an 1868 to 1870</v>
<v Speaker 4>principles of chemistry.</v>

951
00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:49.170
<v Speaker 4>The definitive textbook of his time to</v>
<v Speaker 4>live men to live.</v>

952
00:44:49.470 --> 00:44:54.470
<v Speaker 4>So one mother fucker and 1868 wrote it</v>
<v Speaker 4>all down the periodic table.</v>

953
00:44:56.790 --> 00:44:59.310
<v Speaker 4>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm sure it's been adjusted over</v>

954
00:44:59.311 --> 00:44:59.941
<v Speaker 4>time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

955
00:44:59.941 --> 00:45:02.160
<v Speaker 4>If they found new elements and new</v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff,</v>

956
00:45:02.190 --> 00:45:05.970
<v Speaker 4>they find new elements all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they just add them to that.</v>

957
00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:07.090
<v Speaker 4>What do they do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

958
00:45:07.110 --> 00:45:09.030
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they were first making it,</v>

959
00:45:09.150 --> 00:45:10.740
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there were actually,</v>

960
00:45:11.070 --> 00:45:15.780
<v Speaker 4>they could predict what elements they</v>
<v Speaker 4>would find based on the elements that</v>

961
00:45:15.781 --> 00:45:20.220
<v Speaker 4>they had already found because there are</v>
<v Speaker 4>like holes in the periodic table where</v>

962
00:45:20.221 --> 00:45:22.800
<v Speaker 4>there should have been things that they</v>
<v Speaker 4>hadn't found yet.</v>

963
00:45:22.830 --> 00:45:26.190
<v Speaker 4>Did you ever see the girl that graduated</v>
<v Speaker 4>and used as her,</v>

964

965

<v Speaker 4>not from reading how it was written,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you just spell it out to what the</v>

966
00:45:35.971 --> 00:45:38.760
<v Speaker 4>elements are says fuck bitches get</v>
<v Speaker 4>money.</v>

967
00:45:39.630 --> 00:45:40.800
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:08.730
<v Speaker 4>Fuck you as you're about the kid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he's got a felony charge on him</v>

993
00:47:08.731 --> 00:47:13.350
<v Speaker 4>cause he posed as a senator and spoke to</v>
<v Speaker 4>a high school and he was like 18 years</v>

994
00:47:13.351 --> 00:47:16.220
<v Speaker 4>old and they all believed him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I didn't find out until the senator</v>

995
00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:18.510
<v Speaker 4>showed up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh No.</v>

996
00:47:18.511 --> 00:47:20.340
<v Speaker 4>So the actual senators showed up and</v>
<v Speaker 4>went,</v>

997
00:47:20.341 --> 00:47:21.570
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not me.</v>

999
00:47:25.470 --> 00:47:27.660
<v Speaker 4>powerful Jessica Lee who are wherever</v>
<v Speaker 4>you are,</v>

1000
00:47:27.661 --> 00:47:29.250
<v Speaker 4>Jessica Lee,</v>

1002
00:47:31.770 --> 00:47:32.970
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry it's not that story.</v>

1003
00:47:32.971 --> 00:47:34.980
<v Speaker 1>I just saw this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just happened yesterday so I think</v>

1004
00:47:34.981 --> 00:47:38.010
<v Speaker 1>there's a couple of the kid wouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Florida who got arrested for being</v>

1005
00:47:38.011 --> 00:47:40.740
<v Speaker 1>a gynecologist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A is kind of getting confused with it or</v>

1006
00:47:40.741 --> 00:47:45.030
<v Speaker 1>like being added to it or are you</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about Katie was posing as a fake</v>

1007
00:47:45.031 --> 00:47:46.500
<v Speaker 1>doctor?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like same thing.</v>

1008
00:47:46.501 --> 00:47:48.360
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was an addendum to that story is how</v>

1009
00:47:48.361 --> 00:47:50.700
<v Speaker 1>I saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A guy like was running a home medical</v>

1010
00:47:50.701 --> 00:47:51.630
<v Speaker 1>clinic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This kid,</v>

1011
00:47:51.631 --> 00:47:53.340
<v Speaker 1>he's saying he was a doctor but he was</v>

1012
00:47:53.860 --> 00:47:57.260
<v Speaker 6>tear it off on a guy who was doing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there was a guy in New York that was</v>

1013
00:47:57.261 --> 00:48:02.261
<v Speaker 6>doing a underground but jobs and plastic</v>
<v Speaker 6>surgery shooting caulk like silicone</v>

1014
00:48:03.410 --> 00:48:07.610
<v Speaker 6>cock like that you'd buy from a</v>
<v Speaker 6>supermarket or a hardware store.</v>

1015
00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:11.420
<v Speaker 6>And these girls asses 18 year old who</v>
<v Speaker 6>poses a sigh?</v>

1016
00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:13.980
<v Speaker 6>Ohio senator facing charges.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1017
00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:15.980
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well this kid's a fucking psycho.</v>

1018
00:48:16.220 --> 00:48:19.880
<v Speaker 6>The fact that he could pull that off.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Keep an eye on that fucker.</v>

1019
00:48:21.170 --> 00:48:24.710
<v Speaker 1>I want to see that speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did he do it to win a bet?</v>

1020
00:48:25.430 --> 00:48:29.180
<v Speaker 1>It feels like conceptual common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll try to remember some of the story.</v>

1021
00:48:29.181 --> 00:48:32.450
<v Speaker 1>Like he's getting a couple of charges</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause he had had a car rented.</v>

1022
00:48:32.451 --> 00:48:34.100
<v Speaker 1>He had people with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like as officials,</v>

1023
00:48:34.101 --> 00:48:37.160
<v Speaker 1>he had fake security.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He went and spoke to a class.</v>

1024
00:48:37.490 --> 00:48:42.470
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we'll see if he's 18 years old.</v>

1025
00:48:42.471 --> 00:48:44.660
<v Speaker 1>I would like pull him aside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1026
00:48:44.990 --> 00:48:47.000
<v Speaker 1>talk to him for a couple days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get to know them,</v>

1027
00:48:47.001 --> 00:48:50.030
<v Speaker 1>find out how crazy you really is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sound very smart.</v>

1028

<v Speaker 1>You might be dealing with some super</v>
<v Speaker 1>genius like sounds hilarious.</v>

1029
00:48:53.361 --> 00:48:56.230
<v Speaker 1>Sounds like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how they would find someone like in</v>

1030
00:48:56.231 --> 00:48:59.450
<v Speaker 1>an x men episode,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like one of those x men movies,</v>

1031
00:48:59.700 --> 00:49:03.200
<v Speaker 1>they'd find this guy who was lying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>people and they're like,</v>

1032

00:55:07.261 --> 00:55:09.180
<v Speaker 4>but they would do it again over and over</v>
<v Speaker 4>again.</v>

1152
00:55:09.630 --> 00:55:12.060
<v Speaker 4>It was so common.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas girls who went to public school,</v>

1153
00:55:12.180 --> 00:55:13.860
<v Speaker 4>they were fucking normal for the most</v>
<v Speaker 4>part,</v>

1154
00:55:13.861 --> 00:55:16.710
<v Speaker 4>unless something bad happened in their</v>
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>

1155
00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:19.890
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And and to think that there are actual</v>

1156
00:55:19.950 --> 00:55:24.950
<v Speaker 4>ordinances all over the world where some</v>
<v Speaker 4>guy's written down in,</v>

1157
00:55:26.041 --> 00:55:31.041
<v Speaker 4>in legal code that you will not place</v>
<v Speaker 4>your penis and an asshole or a mouth or</v>

1158
00:55:33.061 --> 00:55:36.840
<v Speaker 4>I'm out of mouth is sodomy getting your</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dick sucked as sodomy and is still</v>

1159
00:55:36.841 --> 00:55:39.270
<v Speaker 4>illegal in certain states.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1160
00:55:39.470 --> 00:55:40.260
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pull,</v>

1161
00:55:40.260 --> 00:55:45.260
<v Speaker 4>pull up sodomy laws in 2016 because as</v>
<v Speaker 4>far as I know in Georgia,</v>

1162
00:55:47.230 --> 00:55:50.970
<v Speaker 4>I was researching this because I am a</v>
<v Speaker 4>researcher.</v>

1163
00:55:51.430 --> 00:55:54.180
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you realize I was</v>
<v Speaker 4>reading some shit.</v>

1164
00:55:54.181 --> 00:55:59.181
<v Speaker 4>Smart people wrote down about this like</v>
<v Speaker 4>seven or eight years ago and there was</v>

1165
00:55:59.851 --> 00:56:03.270
<v Speaker 4>some dispute about it that it was like</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was some places in the country</v>

1166
00:56:03.271 --> 00:56:08.010
<v Speaker 4>where we're still illegal to have anal</v>
<v Speaker 4>or oral sex because it falls under a</v>

1167
00:56:08.011 --> 00:56:10.560
<v Speaker 4>sodomy law.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Go down on your wife,</v>

1168
00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:11.753
<v Speaker 4>you can go to jail.</v>

1169
00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:14.760
<v Speaker 4>Cops come in and they catch you going</v>
<v Speaker 4>down your wife.</v>

1170
00:56:14.761 --> 00:56:16.770
<v Speaker 4>You're committing a fucking cry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1171
00:56:17.020 --> 00:56:19.100
<v Speaker 4>He loves that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's real and someplace.</v>

1172
00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:20.460
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's true.</v>

1173
00:56:20.700 --> 00:56:22.020
<v Speaker 4>That's the state,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1174
00:56:22.340 --> 00:56:25.780
<v Speaker 4>Fuck t that ever get written down in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>first place.</v>

1175
00:56:25.781 --> 00:56:28.810
<v Speaker 4>Like who's trying to stop pussy eating,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's just stepping in and saying,</v>

1176
00:56:29.770 --> 00:56:31.750
<v Speaker 4>this is just way too much pussy eating</v>
<v Speaker 4>going on.</v>

1177
00:56:31.751 --> 00:56:33.280
<v Speaker 4>We've got to lock these fucking people</v>
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>

1178
00:56:33.800 --> 00:56:34.800
<v Speaker 4>Like who,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who,</v>

1179
00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:36.730
<v Speaker 4>who did that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1180
00:56:36.820 --> 00:56:41.820
<v Speaker 4>I probably a hardcore Christian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would imagine.</v>

1181
00:56:41.831 --> 00:56:46.150
<v Speaker 4>I mean when you were a lot of the people</v>
<v Speaker 4>living in this country,</v>

1182
00:56:46.151 --> 00:56:48.880
<v Speaker 4>not that very long ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or you know,</v>

1183
00:56:48.881 --> 00:56:53.881
<v Speaker 4>burning witches.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So probably like sucking on a pussy is</v>

1184
00:56:53.981 --> 00:56:58.981
<v Speaker 4>considered to be some form of witchcraft</v>
<v Speaker 4>because the body was evil.</v>

1185
00:56:59.830 --> 00:57:00.870
<v Speaker 4>The ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the bodies,</v>

1186
00:57:01.270 --> 00:57:03.940
<v Speaker 4>the bodies corrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the body is correct as to the body's</v>

1187
00:57:03.941 --> 00:57:05.050
<v Speaker 4>corrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>special yours.</v>

1188
00:57:05.770 --> 00:57:07.870
<v Speaker 4>It's corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I stink.</v>

1189
00:57:07.930 --> 00:57:10.210
<v Speaker 4>Corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the body is foul.</v>

1190
00:57:10.211 --> 00:57:11.500
<v Speaker 4>The body is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1191
00:57:11.501 --> 00:57:14.920
<v Speaker 4>So you have to deal file your foul.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have original sin,</v>

1192
00:57:15.610 --> 00:57:17.080
<v Speaker 4>you have original sin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why do,</v>

1193
00:57:17.380 --> 00:57:18.570
<v Speaker 4>well you've got to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1194
00:57:18.700 --> 00:57:21.120
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to die.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know that if you let it go,</v>

1195
00:57:21.940 --> 00:57:23.740
<v Speaker 4>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do I not go to hell?</v>

1196
00:57:23.770 --> 00:57:28.590
<v Speaker 4>Please tell we've got a payment plan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they make you,</v>

1197
00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:32.290
<v Speaker 4>you don't have to suck a few decks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they make you,</v>

1198
00:57:32.291 --> 00:57:36.490
<v Speaker 4>you can whip your back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what people would gorge herself.</v>

1199
00:57:36.491 --> 00:57:38.980
<v Speaker 4>People still do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They do it with knives,</v>

1200
00:57:39.330 --> 00:57:42.880
<v Speaker 4>swapped themselves with knives and touch</v>
<v Speaker 4>the strings and they just tear their</v>

1201
00:57:42.881 --> 00:57:45.550
<v Speaker 4>back apart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And as suicide bomb just went off at one</v>

1202
00:57:45.551 --> 00:57:47.980
<v Speaker 4>of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's video of people whipping</v>

1203
00:57:47.981 --> 00:57:50.170
<v Speaker 4>their backs and then a suicide bomb</v>
<v Speaker 4>goes,</v>

1204
00:57:50.290 --> 00:57:55.290
<v Speaker 4>that's how weird shit is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pull up the suicide bomb back whipping</v>

1205
00:57:55.361 --> 00:57:56.194
<v Speaker 4>festival.</v>

1206
00:58:01.700 --> 00:58:02.700
<v Speaker 4>The festival.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1207
00:58:03.190 --> 00:58:05.170
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought the fucking dog eating</v>

1208
00:58:05.171 --> 00:58:06.940
<v Speaker 4>festival was fake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That dog.</v>

1209
00:58:06.941 --> 00:58:08.410
<v Speaker 4>Any festival in China.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1210
00:58:08.411 --> 00:58:10.330
<v Speaker 4>there's not really a dog eating festival</v>
<v Speaker 4>is there?</v>

1211
00:58:10.331 --> 00:58:12.850
<v Speaker 4>I thought that was just a joke as it</v>
<v Speaker 4>sounds so funny.</v>

1212
00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:16.510
<v Speaker 4>Yulin dog meat festival.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1213
00:58:16.570 --> 00:58:19.630
<v Speaker 4>and then I made the mistake of looking</v>
<v Speaker 4>up do that.</v>

1214
00:58:20.530 --> 00:58:22.720
<v Speaker 4>Don't look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>

1215
00:58:22.750 --> 00:58:27.750
<v Speaker 4>That's the worst thing of all time is so</v>
<v Speaker 4>weird.</v>

1216
00:58:28.090 --> 00:58:31.300
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the hierarchy of animal life that we</v>

1217
00:58:31.301 --> 00:58:33.100
<v Speaker 4>have in this world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1218
00:58:33.101 --> 00:58:37.780
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that's coming more into</v>
<v Speaker 4>focus now that you're hunting animals</v>

1219
00:58:37.781 --> 00:58:41.730
<v Speaker 4>now that you've actually killed animals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you think like your views on it are</v>

1220
00:58:41.740 --> 00:58:46.000
<v Speaker 4>shifting at all because you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>slaughtering your own meat sometimes now</v>

1221
00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:50.680
<v Speaker 4>I think I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have more experiences with some,</v>

1222
00:58:50.740 --> 00:58:54.100
<v Speaker 4>some wild animals than some people do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's about it.</v>

1223
00:58:54.730 --> 00:58:57.700
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what do I know in terms of me,</v>

1224
00:58:57.790 --> 00:59:00.580
<v Speaker 4>the whole experience,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the wild animal experience.</v>

1225
00:59:00.581 --> 00:59:03.580
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is just the experience of getting</v>

1226
00:59:03.581 --> 00:59:08.581
<v Speaker 4>out of the city and going into the wild</v>
<v Speaker 4>itself is very psychedelic and some very</v>

1227
00:59:09.281 --> 00:59:12.610
<v Speaker 4>strange way and I didn't feel that way</v>
<v Speaker 4>until I started hunting</v>

1228
00:59:14.560 --> 00:59:15.130
<v Speaker 4>sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Babel.</v>

1229
00:59:15.130 --> 00:59:16.270
<v Speaker 4>Let me explain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I,</v>

1230
00:59:16.360 --> 00:59:19.330
<v Speaker 4>before when I would go to the wilderness</v>
<v Speaker 4>before I'd be like,</v>

1231
00:59:19.331 --> 00:59:21.560
<v Speaker 4>what a cool place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So beautiful.</v>

1232
00:59:21.561 --> 00:59:22.550
<v Speaker 4>It's so peaceful.</v>

1233
00:59:22.550 --> 00:59:24.230
<v Speaker 2>I love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love the clean air.</v>

1234
00:59:24.410 --> 00:59:27.570
<v Speaker 2>I love looking at the green trees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look how pretty that river is.</v>

1235
00:59:28.190 --> 00:59:33.190
<v Speaker 2>When I started hunting I became somehow</v>
<v Speaker 2>or another like connected to all these</v>

1236
00:59:33.891 --> 00:59:38.891
<v Speaker 2>living things that are there and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>in their world and you exist on their</v>

1237
00:59:39.081 --> 00:59:40.310
<v Speaker 2>vibration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very,</v>

1238
00:59:40.550 --> 00:59:44.600
<v Speaker 2>when you're hunting like an elk or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that and you're slowly</v>

1239
00:59:44.601 --> 00:59:49.601
<v Speaker 2>creeping up on it in the woods with real</v>
<v Speaker 2>consequences involved for both of you.</v>

1240
00:59:49.970 --> 00:59:52.040
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a real moment,</v>

1241
00:59:52.041 --> 00:59:55.610
<v Speaker 2>a real end to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then when you do take that animal</v>

1242
00:59:55.611 --> 01:00:00.140
<v Speaker 2>and kill it and wind up eating it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got some in credibly weird</v>

1243
01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:03.770
<v Speaker 2>psychic connection to that place in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

1244
01:00:03.980 --> 01:00:08.480
<v Speaker 2>that place on our planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just as simple as like,</v>

1245
01:00:08.481 --> 01:00:11.240
<v Speaker 2>I know where my food comes from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1246
01:00:11.270 --> 01:00:12.860
<v Speaker 2>but that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1247
01:00:12.890 --> 01:00:17.780
<v Speaker 2>that's definitely good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But killing it yourself and then eating</v>

1248
01:00:17.781 --> 01:00:20.420
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a totally different thing going</v>

1249
01:00:20.421 --> 01:00:24.800
<v Speaker 2>on there and killing it with a bow and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Arrow hunting this thing down,</v>

1250
01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:27.530
<v Speaker 2>finding it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>putting a perfect shot on it,</v>

1251
01:00:27.531 --> 01:00:29.000
<v Speaker 2>killing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>watching it die,</v>

1252
01:00:29.001 --> 01:00:31.220
<v Speaker 2>then eating it and then knowing when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat it,</v>

1253
01:00:31.221 --> 01:00:36.170
<v Speaker 2>they just experiences insane primal</v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences connected to this food.</v>

1254
01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:38.810
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so much going on there.</v>

1255
01:00:38.930 --> 01:00:39.920
<v Speaker 2>It's so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so much,</v>

1256
01:00:39.950 --> 01:00:44.210
<v Speaker 2>so much weird calming things happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it puts you in like this,</v>

1257
01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:45.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about like there's</v>

1258
01:00:45.801 --> 01:00:48.710
<v Speaker 2>certain primal reward systems that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>all have.</v>

1259
01:00:48.711 --> 01:00:51.410
<v Speaker 2>Like we were talking about like making a</v>
<v Speaker 2>fire.</v>

1260
01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:54.710
<v Speaker 2>Like there's something about standing</v>
<v Speaker 2>over a fire that's like a primal reward</v>

1261
01:00:54.711 --> 01:00:55.544
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1262
01:00:55.610 --> 01:00:57.860
<v Speaker 2>there's a little bit of that and bows</v>
<v Speaker 2>and arrows to,</v>

1263
01:00:57.861 --> 01:00:58.730
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

1264
01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:02.240
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like these things are</v>
<v Speaker 2>established in our,</v>

1265
01:01:02.420 --> 01:01:07.400
<v Speaker 2>in our our mind because they're what</v>
<v Speaker 2>made people become successful and</v>

1266
01:01:07.401 --> 01:01:12.290
<v Speaker 2>survive thousands of years ago and those</v>
<v Speaker 2>rewards are ingrained in our patterns</v>

1267
01:01:12.710 --> 01:01:15.950
<v Speaker 2>and it's like almost like ignoring them</v>
<v Speaker 2>by not going outside,</v>

1268
01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:19.190
<v Speaker 2>by not starting fire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by not doing things like archery or</v>

1269
01:01:19.191 --> 01:01:23.300
<v Speaker 2>physical exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will you reward your body with these</v>

1270
01:01:23.301 --> 01:01:27.020
<v Speaker 2>experiences that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just craving on a genetic level.</v>

1271
01:01:27.050 --> 01:01:30.680
<v Speaker 2>It's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not making you a dummy to exercise</v>

1272
01:01:30.681 --> 01:01:33.050
<v Speaker 2>your body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not making you a fool to care about</v>

1273
01:01:33.051 --> 01:01:38.051
<v Speaker 2>camp fires it you're taking in something</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this world that you might need.</v>

1274
01:01:38.300 --> 01:01:39.950
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The same thing.</v>

1275
01:01:40.100 --> 01:01:42.980
<v Speaker 2>I've been thinking a lot about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been thinking about a lot of this</v>

1276
01:01:42.981 --> 01:01:46.490
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in applying to why things are attractive</v>

1277
01:01:46.491 --> 01:01:51.140
<v Speaker 2>and beautiful because I've been freaking</v>
<v Speaker 2>out about views lately because I have</v>

1278
01:01:51.141 --> 01:01:55.700
<v Speaker 2>this friend and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't give a fuck about views,</v>

1279
01:01:55.730 --> 01:01:58.340
<v Speaker 2>could not care less,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't go anywhere,</v>

1280
01:01:58.370 --> 01:02:01.250
<v Speaker 2>just works and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and his house like that was,</v>

1281
01:02:01.251 --> 01:02:03.320
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was our last concern was the view</v>

1282
01:02:03.350 --> 01:02:06.740
<v Speaker 2>we're into our people and this guy's</v>
<v Speaker 2>just constantly do or watching Netflix,</v>

1283
01:02:06.870 --> 01:02:08.240
<v Speaker 2>working,</v>
<v Speaker 2>watching Netflix.</v>

1284
01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:13.760
<v Speaker 2>And I was thinking like w w what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is it that I like about a view?</v>

1285
01:02:13.761 --> 01:02:15.470
<v Speaker 2>Like what the fuck is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like why,</v>

1286
01:02:15.471 --> 01:02:19.040
<v Speaker 2>why is it important to me to stare like</v>
<v Speaker 2>a moron out into psych?</v>

1287
01:02:19.110 --> 01:02:20.070
<v Speaker 2>What is beauty?</v>

1288
01:02:20.150 --> 01:02:24.180
<v Speaker 6>Like what is this thing that I'm seeing</v>
<v Speaker 6>what I see snow capped mountains and</v>

1289
01:02:24.181 --> 01:02:25.960
<v Speaker 6>clouds rolling the cross,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1290
01:02:26.190 --> 01:02:30.030
<v Speaker 6>mostly blue sky and the sun rays hitting</v>
<v Speaker 6>the green leaves.</v>

1291
01:02:30.210 --> 01:02:33.960
<v Speaker 6>To me it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like some sort of a common drug.</v>

1292
01:02:34.110 --> 01:02:39.110
<v Speaker 6>Like my body is being given some stuff</v>
<v Speaker 6>that it needed and I wasn't getting it</v>

1293
01:02:39.270 --> 01:02:41.730
<v Speaker 6>when I was inside the house.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wasn't getting it when it was in my</v>

1294
01:02:41.731 --> 01:02:42.361
<v Speaker 6>car.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

1295
01:02:42.361 --> 01:02:46.410
<v Speaker 6>I needed to be there and it was giving</v>
<v Speaker 6>me this thing that I can't put on a</v>

1296
01:02:46.411 --> 01:02:48.450
<v Speaker 6>scale.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can't measure it with a ruler,</v>

1297
01:02:48.451 --> 01:02:50.610
<v Speaker 6>but it's a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a real thing that you're</v>

1298
01:02:50.611 --> 01:02:53.730
<v Speaker 6>experiencing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think all those things that made us</v>

1299
01:02:53.820 --> 01:02:58.740
<v Speaker 6>alive in 2016 all those things are</v>
<v Speaker 6>those,</v>

1300
01:02:58.780 --> 01:03:03.690
<v Speaker 6>they're a part of like our requirements</v>
<v Speaker 6>and because so few people fill out those</v>

1301
01:03:03.691 --> 01:03:06.180
<v Speaker 6>requirements.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that's one of the reasons why so</v>

1302
01:03:06.181 --> 01:03:07.350
<v Speaker 6>many people are depressed.</v>

1303
01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:11.670
<v Speaker 6>And I think the beauty is because those</v>
<v Speaker 6>beautiful things that we look at almost</v>

1304
01:03:11.671 --> 01:03:15.060
<v Speaker 6>always they represent places where life</v>
<v Speaker 6>flourishes,</v>

1305
01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:17.910
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it's almost like as people wandering</v>

1306
01:03:17.911 --> 01:03:22.911
<v Speaker 6>across the world looking for food,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you saw all the sudden green grass</v>

1307
01:03:24.181 --> 01:03:28.560
<v Speaker 6>and fruit hanging from trees and animals</v>
<v Speaker 6>and there's snow.</v>

1308
01:03:28.561 --> 01:03:30.690
<v Speaker 6>So the snow cap mountains,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which means is a river,</v>

1309
01:03:30.691 --> 01:03:32.460
<v Speaker 6>there's water,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we can drink the water,</v>

1310
01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:34.500
<v Speaker 6>we got food,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're going to live,</v>

1311
01:03:34.650 --> 01:03:35.880
<v Speaker 6>we're going to live,</v>
<v Speaker 6>try it.</v>

1312
01:03:35.881 --> 01:03:40.881
<v Speaker 6>And so you would see that beautiful</v>
<v Speaker 6>bountiful forest in front of you and Ah,</v>

1313
01:03:41.310 --> 01:03:43.530
<v Speaker 6>it would feed your requirement.</v>

1314
01:03:43.890 --> 01:03:44.311
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1315
01:03:44.311 --> 01:03:44.820
<v Speaker 3>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1316
01:03:44.820 --> 01:03:45.740
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are,</v>

1317
01:03:45.820 --> 01:03:48.050
<v Speaker 3>it tells you something cause it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1318
01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:50.240
<v Speaker 3>it tells you this huge secret.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1319
01:03:50.300 --> 01:03:53.000
<v Speaker 3>And I'm not saying there's a conspiracy</v>
<v Speaker 3>where people don't want you to know this</v>

1320
01:03:53.001 --> 01:03:54.710
<v Speaker 3>because it's obviously something you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

1321
01:03:54.711 --> 01:03:59.711
<v Speaker 3>but the earth supports you and the earth</v>
<v Speaker 3>will take care of you.</v>

1322
01:03:59.990 --> 01:04:02.930
<v Speaker 3>If you work hard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the earth will take care of you,</v>

1323
01:04:02.931 --> 01:04:07.931
<v Speaker 3>not work hard as in like work hard in</v>
<v Speaker 3>your factory or your company,</v>

1324
01:04:08.420 --> 01:04:13.420
<v Speaker 3>but suddenly when you realize there's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>force that transcends the law of</v>

1325
01:04:14.271 --> 01:04:18.500
<v Speaker 3>humanity and that is nature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you realize that if you know</v>

1326
01:04:18.501 --> 01:04:20.510
<v Speaker 3>how to like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I was telling you,</v>

1327
01:04:20.511 --> 01:04:22.490
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to learn how to start a bow</v>
<v Speaker 3>fire right now.</v>

1328
01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:23.750
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1329
01:04:23.820 --> 01:04:25.580
<v Speaker 3>I'm just to get a bit like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

1330
01:04:25.940 --> 01:04:27.450
<v Speaker 3>there's different ways of doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1331
01:04:27.460 --> 01:04:31.160
<v Speaker 3>I just want to start a friction base</v>
<v Speaker 3>fire that guy was doing,</v>

1332
01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:33.020
<v Speaker 3>like that guy was doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was going to fuck your hands up.</v>

1333
01:04:33.050 --> 01:04:35.360
<v Speaker 3>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to do what I want to experience</v>

1334
01:04:35.361 --> 01:04:38.270
<v Speaker 3>it and I want to know that I can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1335
01:04:38.450 --> 01:04:40.310
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what starts happening when you,</v>

1336
01:04:40.370 --> 01:04:43.340
<v Speaker 3>when you're doing shit like shooting a</v>
<v Speaker 3>bow and you realize like,</v>

1337
01:04:43.341 --> 01:04:44.450
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could do this.</v>

1338
01:04:44.451 --> 01:04:48.080
<v Speaker 3>I can like hit a target.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the implication is if you</v>

1339
01:04:48.081 --> 01:04:50.810
<v Speaker 3>needed to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could hunt your own food.</v>

1340
01:04:50.990 --> 01:04:54.260
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't have to go to a job,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't have to get enough money to</v>

1341
01:04:54.261 --> 01:04:56.840
<v Speaker 3>buy the food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you get good enough at this,</v>

1342
01:04:57.020 --> 01:05:01.460
<v Speaker 3>you can hunt your own food and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't matter who's paying you.</v>

1343
01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:05.420
<v Speaker 3>And if you can start your own fire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can have heat no matter what.</v>

1344
01:05:05.421 --> 01:05:07.040
<v Speaker 3>And then if you can build your own</v>
<v Speaker 3>shelter,</v>

1345
01:05:07.220 --> 01:05:11.460
<v Speaker 3>you can have a shelter somewhere and all</v>
<v Speaker 3>these things when you see they come for</v>

1346
01:05:11.461 --> 01:05:14.990
<v Speaker 3>you in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it seems like so much of our</v>

1347
01:05:14.991 --> 01:05:19.991
<v Speaker 3>society is based on this incredible</v>
<v Speaker 3>insecurity that if you don't keep</v>

1348
01:05:21.340 --> 01:05:25.390
<v Speaker 3>marching in place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your life is going to fall apart because</v>

1349
01:05:25.391 --> 01:05:29.920
<v Speaker 3>you have become a slacker and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you've gone against the,</v>

1350
01:05:29.950 --> 01:05:30.783
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1351
01:05:30.870 --> 01:05:35.120
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pulsation of modern society and,</v>

1352
01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:36.430
<v Speaker 3>and my improvement.</v>

1353
01:05:36.700 --> 01:05:37.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

1354
01:05:37.970 --> 01:05:41.710
<v Speaker 3>And that's what we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's an incorrect anxiety inducing</v>

1355
01:05:41.711 --> 01:05:42.544
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1356
01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:45.160
<v Speaker 3>So it's a scary place to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like fuck.</v>

1357
01:05:45.161 --> 01:05:46.360
<v Speaker 3>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit man,</v>

1358
01:05:46.361 --> 01:05:50.230
<v Speaker 3>I got to pay this much for taxes and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>got to go to work this many hours a week</v>

1359
01:05:50.231 --> 01:05:52.840
<v Speaker 3>and I've got to like all of these things</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I have to do.</v>

1360
01:05:52.841 --> 01:05:56.060
<v Speaker 3>I've got my fucking credit card payments</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I have to make.</v>

1361
01:05:56.061 --> 01:05:57.310
<v Speaker 3>And if I don't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in trouble.</v>

1362
01:05:57.311 --> 01:06:01.600
<v Speaker 3>You're like abiding by a false system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a real system,</v>

1363
01:06:01.810 --> 01:06:04.840
<v Speaker 3>but it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The real is like the earth where if</v>

1364
01:06:04.841 --> 01:06:07.480
<v Speaker 3>you're on the earth and you're walking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not thinking shit,</v>

1365
01:06:07.481 --> 01:06:10.990
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rent's due next month.</v>

1366
01:06:10.991 --> 01:06:15.190
<v Speaker 3>You're thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got to find food to eat.</v>

1367
01:06:15.370 --> 01:06:18.820
<v Speaker 3>I've got to find a place to take</v>
<v Speaker 3>shelter.</v>

1368
01:06:18.850 --> 01:06:21.220
<v Speaker 3>I've got there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All these things are very simple and</v>

1369
01:06:21.221 --> 01:06:23.230
<v Speaker 3>there's no human in charge of it.</v>

1370
01:06:23.470 --> 01:06:26.320
<v Speaker 3>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not making a call to the woman at</v>

1371
01:06:26.321 --> 01:06:31.321
<v Speaker 3>Bank of America asking her why she froze</v>
<v Speaker 3>your card up because he used to parking</v>

1372
01:06:31.331 --> 01:06:35.620
<v Speaker 3>meters on the same day that were close</v>
<v Speaker 3>to each other in a weird place and now</v>

1373
01:06:35.621 --> 01:06:37.660
<v Speaker 3>you're not able to buy dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no,</v>

1374
01:06:37.810 --> 01:06:41.890
<v Speaker 3>when you're in the nature hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no operator that you call to</v>

1375
01:06:41.891 --> 01:06:45.790
<v Speaker 3>complain about the lack of food or to</v>
<v Speaker 3>complain about the weather.</v>

1376
01:06:45.970 --> 01:06:47.980
<v Speaker 3>It's just truth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pure,</v>

1377
01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:51.760
<v Speaker 3>unadulterated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>100% truth,</v>

1378
01:06:51.761 --> 01:06:55.000
<v Speaker 3>and when you're in contact with truth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it feels fucking crate.</v>

1379
01:06:55.420 --> 01:06:58.810
<v Speaker 3>It's relaxing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you've constantly been basing your</v>

1380
01:06:58.811 --> 01:07:02.170
<v Speaker 3>perception of truth on what other people</v>
<v Speaker 3>are telling you it is.</v>

1381
01:07:02.171 --> 01:07:03.880
<v Speaker 3>I think that's part of the comfort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1382
01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:06.660
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a pole without a doubt that</v>

1383
01:07:06.661 --> 01:07:11.070
<v Speaker 2>humanity is experiencing and that poll</v>
<v Speaker 2>has been going on since people figured</v>

1384
01:07:11.071 --> 01:07:14.430
<v Speaker 2>out how to make the first bow fire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's when they figured out how to</v>

1385
01:07:14.431 --> 01:07:16.500
<v Speaker 2>control fire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they figured out how to make</v>

1386
01:07:16.501 --> 01:07:20.340
<v Speaker 2>shelter and then they figured out how to</v>
<v Speaker 2>stockpile shit and they figured out how</v>

1387
01:07:20.341 --> 01:07:24.030
<v Speaker 2>to group together in small villages and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they figured out how to make walls</v>

1388
01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:27.570
<v Speaker 2>and they figured out how to make cities</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they figured out how to cool shit</v>

1389
01:07:27.571 --> 01:07:30.090
<v Speaker 2>off and that's worth stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got Freaky,</v>

1390
01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:32.490
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They figured out factory farming and</v>

1391
01:07:32.491 --> 01:07:35.640
<v Speaker 2>they figured out fast food and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>figured out supermarkets and then they</v>

1392
01:07:35.641 --> 01:07:39.930
<v Speaker 2>figured out the electrical maze that</v>
<v Speaker 2>goes through this entire country that</v>

1393
01:07:39.931 --> 01:07:43.050
<v Speaker 2>keeps everything cold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All your food stays cold.</v>

1394
01:07:43.051 --> 01:07:45.570
<v Speaker 2>You always have food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can heat things up,</v>

1395
01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:48.000
<v Speaker 2>you can cool things off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got that shit on lock.</v>

1396
01:07:48.030 --> 01:07:48.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1397
01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:51.360
<v Speaker 2>and then from then it's like what we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing is,</v>

1398
01:07:51.361 --> 01:07:56.361
<v Speaker 2>this is like the final stages of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>caterpillar covering itself with a</v>

1399
01:07:56.491 --> 01:07:59.640
<v Speaker 2>cocoon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the last final frenzy.</v>

1400
01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:02.520
<v Speaker 2>So there's an innovation that's been</v>
<v Speaker 2>going on for thousands of years,</v>

1401
01:08:02.700 --> 01:08:06.240
<v Speaker 2>but then it hits this point about a</v>
<v Speaker 2>hundred years ago or so where they</v>

1402
01:08:06.241 --> 01:08:10.110
<v Speaker 2>figured out how to cool things down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They figured out ice boxes and then</v>

1403
01:08:10.111 --> 01:08:11.910
<v Speaker 2>refrigerators,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it got to the point where</v>

1404
01:08:11.911 --> 01:08:15.170
<v Speaker 2>everybody had a refrigerator and then it</v>
<v Speaker 2>got to the point where supermarkets were</v>

1405
01:08:15.171 --> 01:08:16.130
<v Speaker 2>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like</v>

1406
01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:19.130
<v Speaker 6>all the cities have supermarkets and</v>
<v Speaker 6>then everybody lost their connection to</v>

1407
01:08:19.131 --> 01:08:20.150
<v Speaker 6>nature.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Everybody,</v>

1408
01:08:20.180 --> 01:08:21.560
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You had to go out and get it.</v>

1409
01:08:21.590 --> 01:08:24.860
<v Speaker 6>You had to go find your connection,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but even then you can action was all we</v>

1410
01:08:24.861 --> 01:08:27.110
<v Speaker 6>like to be out in nature.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How many days a week,</v>

1411
01:08:27.140 --> 01:08:29.150
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was it even one,</v>

1412
01:08:29.210 --> 01:08:30.043
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

1413
01:08:30.110 --> 01:08:32.780
<v Speaker 6>it's usually once every two weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You go on a hike and you claim your</v>

1414
01:08:32.781 --> 01:08:33.500
<v Speaker 6>nature,</v>
<v Speaker 6>boy,</v>

1415
01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:34.850
<v Speaker 6>shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>

1416
01:08:34.851 --> 01:08:35.480
<v Speaker 6>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're,</v>

1417
01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:38.750
<v Speaker 6>we're in the hive right now or</v>
<v Speaker 6>constructing this crazy thing.</v>

1418
01:08:38.780 --> 01:08:41.840
<v Speaker 6>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And if you really are like a real solid</v>

1419
01:08:41.841 --> 01:08:43.700
<v Speaker 6>ass nature person that's out there in</v>
<v Speaker 6>the woods,</v>

1420
01:08:43.940 --> 01:08:47.600
<v Speaker 6>you gotta be freaked out watching this</v>
<v Speaker 6>go on outside your front door because</v>

1421
01:08:47.601 --> 01:08:51.920
<v Speaker 6>even the world that you live is going to</v>
<v Speaker 6>be affected by this craziness of these</v>

1422
01:08:51.921 --> 01:08:56.750
<v Speaker 6>fucking frenzied cocoon making monkeys</v>
<v Speaker 6>that are scrambling to cover everything</v>

1423
01:08:56.751 --> 01:08:59.000
<v Speaker 6>with wires.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're covering everything with</v>

1424
01:08:59.001 --> 01:09:04.001
<v Speaker 6>electrical wires and internet wires and</v>
<v Speaker 6>wireless wires is everywhere.</v>

1425
01:09:04.071 --> 01:09:07.480
<v Speaker 6>I'm matrix of information and data</v>
<v Speaker 6>swarming around.</v>

1426
01:09:08.140 --> 01:09:12.310
<v Speaker 3>My brother has a place off the coast of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Georgia,</v>

1427
01:09:12.710 --> 01:09:14.180
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this place called little cumberland.</v>

1428
01:09:15.010 --> 01:09:16.120
<v Speaker 3>It's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can't,</v>

1429
01:09:16.121 --> 01:09:16.741
<v Speaker 3>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1430
01:09:16.741 --> 01:09:19.030
<v Speaker 3>you could try and get there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a beautiful place.</v>

1431
01:09:19.031 --> 01:09:21.640
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1432
01:09:21.641 --> 01:09:23.200
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's a place where like,</v>

1433
01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:26.470
<v Speaker 3>it's like a nature conservancy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the people who live there</v>

1434
01:09:26.471 --> 01:09:28.630
<v Speaker 3>grandfathered in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a very intense,</v>

1435
01:09:28.631 --> 01:09:31.330
<v Speaker 3>beautiful place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the point is now they're having</v>

1436
01:09:31.331 --> 01:09:32.740
<v Speaker 3>these fucking problems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1437
01:09:33.130 --> 01:09:35.800
<v Speaker 3>Because guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone wants to build right next to</v>

1438
01:09:35.801 --> 01:09:39.280
<v Speaker 3>this beautiful chain of islands off the</v>
<v Speaker 3>coast of Georgia oil refinery,</v>

1439
01:09:39.370 --> 01:09:42.460
<v Speaker 3>a space center.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do they want to build?</v>

1440
01:09:42.461 --> 01:09:45.400
<v Speaker 3>A place to launch fucking rockets into</v>
<v Speaker 3>space.</v>

1441
01:09:45.420 --> 01:09:48.580
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's what you know and right outside</v>

1442
01:09:48.581 --> 01:09:49.570
<v Speaker 3>of this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

1443
01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:51.550
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's a fucking problem and hopefully</v>

1444
01:09:51.551 --> 01:09:52.440
<v Speaker 3>they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll did,</v>

1445
01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:56.380
<v Speaker 3>this is where my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is right now is like where my mind</v>

1446
01:09:56.381 --> 01:10:01.381
<v Speaker 3>is really in a boxing match with itself</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I Yap so much about virtual</v>

1447
01:10:02.081 --> 01:10:03.370
<v Speaker 3>reality technology.</v>

1448
01:10:03.370 --> 01:10:04.780
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's incredible.</v>

1449
01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:08.350
<v Speaker 3>But lately after I've been doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like just,</v>

1450
01:10:08.710 --> 01:10:11.020
<v Speaker 3>I mean it sounds so guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been inside so much,</v>

1451
01:10:11.021 --> 01:10:14.770
<v Speaker 3>this seems spectacular to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now that I've been going outside and</v>

1452
01:10:14.771 --> 01:10:18.940
<v Speaker 3>just shooting a bow and arrow or just</v>
<v Speaker 3>going outside and like hanging out with</v>

1453
01:10:18.941 --> 01:10:23.260
<v Speaker 3>my dogs or just being outside and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1454
01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:26.680
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one interesting byproduct that I've</v>

1455
01:10:26.681 --> 01:10:31.420
<v Speaker 3>noticed from microdosing lsd and also</v>
<v Speaker 3>are from not just micro dosing,</v>

1456
01:10:31.421 --> 01:10:34.780
<v Speaker 3>but from taking mushrooms is the next</v>
<v Speaker 3>day you feel more connected to nature.</v>

1457
01:10:35.140 --> 01:10:38.620
<v Speaker 3>You notice plants again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see how beautiful flowers are again.</v>

1458
01:10:38.621 --> 01:10:40.210
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't need the psychedelic to do</v>

1459
01:10:40.211 --> 01:10:45.070
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can just spend one minute stopping</v>

1460
01:10:45.071 --> 01:10:50.071
<v Speaker 3>next to a flower and staring at it up</v>
<v Speaker 3>close and you'll realize this is w this</v>

1461
01:10:51.821 --> 01:10:53.710
<v Speaker 3>is an alien.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is some beautiful,</v>

1462
01:10:53.711 --> 01:10:58.630
<v Speaker 3>insane alien habitat for all these other</v>
<v Speaker 3>creatures that are living inside of it.</v>

1463
01:10:58.630 --> 01:11:02.440
<v Speaker 3>And it's just fucking amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I don't know,</v>

1464
01:11:02.670 --> 01:11:04.000
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

1465
01:11:04.001 --> 01:11:07.420
<v Speaker 3>I'm not about to turn into a nudist and</v>
<v Speaker 3>go running off into the woods or</v>

1466
01:11:07.421 --> 01:11:10.150
<v Speaker 3>anything like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what about the show today?</v>

1467
01:11:10.210 --> 01:11:13.620
<v Speaker 3>The way I'm going to become a nudist and</v>
<v Speaker 3>run the woods?</v>

1468
01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:15.930
<v Speaker 3>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

1469
01:11:16.010 --> 01:11:18.390
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kind of get the whole that the whole</v>

1470
01:11:18.391 --> 01:11:19.800
<v Speaker 3>next day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the,</v>

1471
01:11:19.801 --> 01:11:20.371
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1472
01:11:20.371 --> 01:11:21.460
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1473
01:11:22.060 --> 01:11:27.060
<v Speaker 3>the problem in my mind is like</v>
<v Speaker 3>simultaneous to this incredible feeling</v>

1474
01:11:27.451 --> 01:11:31.710
<v Speaker 3>you get from nature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is this other thing that's</v>

1475
01:11:31.711 --> 01:11:33.060
<v Speaker 3>emerging and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1476
01:11:33.070 --> 01:11:36.510
<v Speaker 3>and where did the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's gotta be a way to balance the</v>

1477
01:11:36.511 --> 01:11:41.511
<v Speaker 3>two out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the feeling I get from playing six</v>

1478
01:11:41.791 --> 01:11:46.791
<v Speaker 3>hours of fallout four versus the feeling</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get from doing yard work for five</v>

1479
01:11:48.751 --> 01:11:51.810
<v Speaker 3>hours or four hours,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then shooting arrows after that,</v>

1480
01:11:52.230 --> 01:11:56.880
<v Speaker 3>or two very different feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one is an incredible feeling.</v>

1481
01:11:56.881 --> 01:11:59.220
<v Speaker 3>Like you just got a massage for six</v>
<v Speaker 3>hours,</v>

1482
01:11:59.221 --> 01:12:01.770
<v Speaker 3>you feel rejuvenated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>happy,</v>

1483
01:12:01.890 --> 01:12:04.350
<v Speaker 3>this kind of clean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not clean at all,</v>

1484
01:12:04.530 --> 01:12:06.540
<v Speaker 3>but you feel like you've just taken a</v>
<v Speaker 3>shower,</v>

1485
01:12:06.541 --> 01:12:08.700
<v Speaker 3>like your energy's been cleansed or</v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

1486
01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:12.450
<v Speaker 3>And then the other feeling is like the</v>
<v Speaker 3>filthy,</v>

1487
01:12:12.451 --> 01:12:14.700
<v Speaker 3>nasty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>disgusting feeling you get from being</v>

1488
01:12:14.701 --> 01:12:15.534
<v Speaker 3>outside.</v>

1489
01:12:18.250 --> 01:12:19.970
<v Speaker 7>Aye.</v>

1490
01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:24.960
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Dunkin,</v>

1491
01:12:24.961 --> 01:12:29.220
<v Speaker 6>I feel the exact opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why when I used to play quake for eight</v>

1492
01:12:29.221 --> 01:12:33.240
<v Speaker 6>hours a night,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would feel like the biggest loser in</v>

1493
01:12:33.241 --> 01:12:34.830
<v Speaker 6>the world when it was done,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would be like,</v>

1494
01:12:34.831 --> 01:12:38.160
<v Speaker 6>what am I doing with my life?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're so you're fucked up.</v>

1495
01:12:38.170 --> 01:12:40.770
<v Speaker 6>Sweaty,</v>
<v Speaker 6>wait way over caffeinated by the way.</v>

1496
01:12:41.070 --> 01:12:43.740
<v Speaker 6>I would drink wage was drinking these</v>
<v Speaker 6>sodas that I found.</v>

1497
01:12:43.890 --> 01:12:46.020
<v Speaker 6>There's this place in north Hollywood,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1498
01:12:46.021 --> 01:12:48.180
<v Speaker 6>near where I lived that had these,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1499
01:12:48.450 --> 01:12:53.270
<v Speaker 6>there were like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>brainwash was one of them and uh,</v>

1500
01:12:53.290 --> 01:12:55.680
<v Speaker 6>they had like a skull on the cover.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It had blue dye,</v>

1501
01:12:55.681 --> 01:12:57.740
<v Speaker 6>like a turn your lips blue and your</v>
<v Speaker 6>toddler.</v>

1502

1503
01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:04.440
<v Speaker 6>But it was so fucking loaded with</v>
<v Speaker 6>caffeine and sugar.</v>

1504
01:13:04.441 --> 01:13:07.860
<v Speaker 6>I would down like five of those while I</v>
<v Speaker 6>was playing video games.</v>

1505
01:13:07.930 --> 01:13:08.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1506
01:13:08.570 --> 01:13:11.680
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like I've been a video game addict</v>

1507
01:13:11.681 --> 01:13:14.090
<v Speaker 3>for most of my life and to good there</v>
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

1508
01:13:14.110 --> 01:13:15.070
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it,</v>

1509
01:13:15.071 --> 01:13:18.280
<v Speaker 3>the feet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've also been someone who loves</v>

1510
01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:21.230
<v Speaker 3>psychedelics and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1511
01:13:21.270 --> 01:13:22.380
<v Speaker 3>the different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1512
01:13:22.381 --> 01:13:27.381
<v Speaker 3>it's just very important to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be honest about where your fucking</v>

1513
01:13:28.121 --> 01:13:31.270
<v Speaker 3>arrows are landing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like if you're playing video games</v>

1514
01:13:31.271 --> 01:13:34.210
<v Speaker 3>all the time and you're getting fat and</v>
<v Speaker 3>feeling sick,</v>

1515
01:13:34.990 --> 01:13:37.360
<v Speaker 3>that's real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you're getting fat and feeling</v>

1516
01:13:37.361 --> 01:13:39.400
<v Speaker 3>sick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like don't trick yourself into thinking</v>

1517
01:13:39.401 --> 01:13:41.980
<v Speaker 3>that you're not like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you feel like shit for a reason because</v>

1518
01:13:42.010 --> 01:13:47.010
<v Speaker 3>something about being inside the cave,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the artificial cave staring into an</v>

1519
01:13:47.770 --> 01:13:49.150
<v Speaker 3>artificial environment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

1520
01:13:49.151 --> 01:13:49.984
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry you guys,</v>

1521
01:13:50.540 --> 01:13:52.550
<v Speaker 6>I do love it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But here's the thing about what you're</v>

1522
01:13:52.551 --> 01:13:55.220
<v Speaker 6>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is it indoor archery has a very similar</v>

1523
01:13:55.221 --> 01:13:57.950
<v Speaker 6>feeling is outdoor archery.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They do indoor archery.</v>

1524
01:13:57.951 --> 01:14:01.340
<v Speaker 6>Tournament's alright.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's archery is a different thing man.</v>

1525
01:14:01.370 --> 01:14:03.730
<v Speaker 6>It's um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's not just the outside part of it,</v>

1526
01:14:03.740 --> 01:14:06.050
<v Speaker 6>the outside of the part of it today,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like when you and I were doing it,</v>

1527
01:14:06.051 --> 01:14:07.610
<v Speaker 6>it was definitely fun.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's cool.</v>

1528
01:14:07.611 --> 01:14:10.070
<v Speaker 6>It's cool to be outside.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And we had a lot of laughs.</v>

1529
01:14:10.100 --> 01:14:11.410
<v Speaker 6>Shot Arrows for a few.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1530
01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:12.010
<v Speaker 6>But</v>

1531
01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:13.660
<v Speaker 2>the indoor thing is really fun too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1532
01:14:13.870 --> 01:14:17.080
<v Speaker 2>There's something really zen about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>concentration,</v>

1533
01:14:17.290 --> 01:14:20.980
<v Speaker 2>the concentrating on your form,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that when you're holding that shot,</v>

1534
01:14:20.981 --> 01:14:23.980
<v Speaker 2>you really can't think of anything other</v>
<v Speaker 2>than executing correctly,</v>

1535
01:14:24.010 --> 01:14:25.840
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything has to be in line and then</v>

1536
01:14:25.841 --> 01:14:30.550
<v Speaker 2>release the Arrow and then you have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>judge by where that landed,</v>

1537
01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:32.920
<v Speaker 2>what you could done differently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's perfect,</v>

1538
01:14:32.921 --> 01:14:33.401
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1539
01:14:33.401 --> 01:14:34.900
<v Speaker 2>we recreate that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1540
01:14:34.901 --> 01:14:37.660
<v Speaker 2>Try to recreate that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's some sort of a weird</v>

1541
01:14:37.661 --> 01:14:40.510
<v Speaker 2>meditation effect in doing that because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

1542
01:14:40.540 --> 01:14:43.360
<v Speaker 2>there's no interference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just you and that target.</v>

1543
01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:45.280
<v Speaker 2>There's no one trying to block your</v>
<v Speaker 2>arrows.</v>

1544
01:14:45.281 --> 01:14:49.150
<v Speaker 2>There's no one screaming in your ear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's difficult enough.</v>

1545
01:14:49.540 --> 01:14:54.540
<v Speaker 2>That's why like there's something about</v>
<v Speaker 2>it that it's like when it all comes</v>

1546
01:14:54.641 --> 01:14:56.170
<v Speaker 2>together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a reward,</v>

1547
01:14:56.171 --> 01:14:57.940
<v Speaker 2>like a beautiful musical note or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

1548
01:14:57.970 --> 01:14:58.930
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1549
01:14:58.970 --> 01:14:59.150
<v Speaker 2>You're</v>

1550
01:14:59.150 --> 01:14:59.920
<v Speaker 3>getting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1551
01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:04.100
<v Speaker 3>it's just there is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world is alive,</v>

1552
01:15:04.130 --> 01:15:06.110
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to take acid to realize</v>

1553
01:15:06.111 --> 01:15:06.944
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the war.</v>

1554
01:15:07.140 --> 01:15:10.940
<v Speaker 3>But it helps the world is alive and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1555
01:15:11.060 --> 01:15:12.200
<v Speaker 3>and when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you,</v>

1556
01:15:12.201 --> 01:15:15.740
<v Speaker 3>when you're in this living being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it may,</v>

1557
01:15:15.750 --> 01:15:18.770
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is composed of all these</v>
<v Speaker 3>other living beings,</v>

1558
01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:21.290
<v Speaker 3>a tea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it has as one of its qualities.</v>

1559
01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:24.410
<v Speaker 3>It teaches you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause like one thing I love to think</v>

1560
01:15:24.411 --> 01:15:26.510
<v Speaker 3>about is who's the smartest person on</v>
<v Speaker 3>earth,</v>

1561
01:15:26.511 --> 01:15:28.520
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what would the smartest person be</v>

1562
01:15:28.521 --> 01:15:31.340
<v Speaker 3>like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I then I think,</v>

1563
01:15:31.341 --> 01:15:33.170
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's the smartest person I know and</v>

1564
01:15:33.171 --> 01:15:35.930
<v Speaker 3>what are they like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I try to from that,</v>

1565
01:15:35.931 --> 01:15:40.100
<v Speaker 3>imagine what if that pattern keeps</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting more intense,</v>

1566
01:15:40.101 --> 01:15:41.570
<v Speaker 3>more and more intense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more and more intense,</v>

1567
01:15:41.571 --> 01:15:43.870
<v Speaker 3>more more intense?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who would that person be like?</v>

1568
01:15:43.871 --> 01:15:46.040
<v Speaker 3>Like what does perfection look like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1569
01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:51.400
<v Speaker 3>So you go into nature and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>instantaneously get a glimpse at</v>

1570
01:15:51.591 --> 01:15:52.730
<v Speaker 3>perfection,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1571
01:15:52.731 --> 01:15:56.060
<v Speaker 3>You look at a flower,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you look at any plant.</v>

1572
01:15:56.061 --> 01:16:00.110
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you look at most animals and what you</v>

1573
01:16:00.111 --> 01:16:02.990
<v Speaker 3>are taught is these things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't care about themselves.</v>

1574
01:16:03.020 --> 01:16:04.610
<v Speaker 3>They don't seem to care about</v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves,</v>

1575
01:16:04.611 --> 01:16:06.980
<v Speaker 3>the personality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ego,</v>

1576
01:16:06.981 --> 01:16:10.700
<v Speaker 3>the identity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously flowers are not getting their</v>

1577
01:16:10.820 --> 01:16:14.900
<v Speaker 3>hair blown out in the morning and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not concerned about anything at</v>

1578
01:16:14.901 --> 01:16:18.110
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just seem to be an expression of</v>

1579
01:16:18.350 --> 01:16:20.270
<v Speaker 3>life into the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No Ego,</v>

1580
01:16:20.271 --> 01:16:21.530
<v Speaker 3>no personality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no identity.</v>

1581
01:16:21.531 --> 01:16:25.880
<v Speaker 3>They're invisible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How there's a whole goddamn beautiful</v>

1582
01:16:26.210 --> 01:16:27.330
<v Speaker 3>Bush of these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1583
01:16:27.380 --> 01:16:29.120
<v Speaker 3>someone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I posted a picture of it,</v>

1584
01:16:29.121 --> 01:16:30.710
<v Speaker 3>but someone told me I can't run the name</v>
<v Speaker 3>of them.</v>

1585
01:16:31.130 --> 01:16:35.240
<v Speaker 3>Beautiful purple flowers and like I</v>
<v Speaker 3>walked by him every day when I'm walking</v>

1586
01:16:35.241 --> 01:16:37.100
<v Speaker 3>the dogs and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I've never noticed them.</v>

1587
01:16:37.101 --> 01:16:38.030
<v Speaker 3>I've never noticed them.</v>

1588
01:16:38.060 --> 01:16:41.990
<v Speaker 3>And then I looked over at then the other</v>
<v Speaker 3>day and the wind's blowing in there.</v>

1589
01:16:41.991 --> 01:16:44.870
<v Speaker 3>It looks like they're like dancing or</v>
<v Speaker 3>bowing or bending.</v>

1590
01:16:44.871 --> 01:16:46.040
<v Speaker 3>And then I got closer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1591
01:16:46.580 --> 01:16:48.200
<v Speaker 3>my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a life form.</v>

1592
01:16:48.230 --> 01:16:52.670
<v Speaker 3>This is like a living thing that I've</v>
<v Speaker 3>been walking by every single day and it</v>

1593
01:16:52.671 --> 01:16:54.290
<v Speaker 3>doesn't give a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I look at it,</v>

1594
01:16:54.470 --> 01:16:57.080
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't care if I look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't know what it cares about.</v>

1595
01:16:57.081 --> 01:16:59.450
<v Speaker 3>It probably cares about nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no central nervous system,</v>

1596
01:16:59.451 --> 01:17:03.410
<v Speaker 3>but it's alive and it's there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you take that as perfection,</v>

1597
01:17:03.411 --> 01:17:07.370
<v Speaker 3>which I think it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then from that try to establish what</v>

1598
01:17:07.371 --> 01:17:09.980
<v Speaker 3>a perfect super intelligent would be</v>
<v Speaker 3>like.</v>

1599
01:17:10.340 --> 01:17:13.520
<v Speaker 1>Then from that you get this idea of what</v>
<v Speaker 1>enlightenment might look like.</v>

1600
01:17:13.550 --> 01:17:18.550
<v Speaker 1>A pure reflection of nature unimpeded by</v>
<v Speaker 1>the awful anchor of the EGOIC mind.</v>

1601
01:17:22.100 --> 01:17:25.910
<v Speaker 1>But it would also be forced to try to</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand what it's doing as a</v>

1602
01:17:25.911 --> 01:17:28.790
<v Speaker 1>collective species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does it doing with this massive</v>

1603
01:17:28.791 --> 01:17:30.920
<v Speaker 1>thirst for innovation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You right,</v>

1604
01:17:31.340 --> 01:17:33.490
<v Speaker 1>what does it doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Constantly trying to make more money and</v>

1605
01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:35.450
<v Speaker 1>get a bigger house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get a fatter boat.</v>

1606
01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:37.610
<v Speaker 1>What does it doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what's it doing?</v>

1607
01:17:37.611 --> 01:17:40.160
<v Speaker 1>Why is it continuing to want the latest</v>
<v Speaker 1>and greatest?</v>

1608
01:17:40.161 --> 01:17:43.040
<v Speaker 1>Why does it continue to ask for new</v>
<v Speaker 1>innovation session with the self?</v>

1609
01:17:43.070 --> 01:17:45.950
<v Speaker 1>It's all obsession with itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Its obsession with technology too.</v>

1610
01:17:46.220 --> 01:17:50.180
<v Speaker 1>And but it's technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean tech is so much of technology</v>

1611
01:17:50.181 --> 01:17:52.040
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like imagine if they weren't to know</v>

1612
01:17:52.041 --> 01:17:53.170
<v Speaker 1>social network,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1613
01:17:53.450 --> 01:17:55.100
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to say the joke but you</v>

1614
01:17:55.101 --> 01:17:57.950
<v Speaker 1>have a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very funny joke about likes.</v>

1615
01:17:58.430 --> 01:17:59.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to give it away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very funny,</v>

1616
01:18:00.230 --> 01:18:01.063
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1617
01:18:01.130 --> 01:18:02.260
<v Speaker 1>so like so much of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

1618
01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:06.950
<v Speaker 1>of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology is based on getting this</v>

1619
01:18:06.951 --> 01:18:08.490
<v Speaker 1>instant feedback.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1620
01:18:08.570 --> 01:18:09.290
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1621
01:18:09.290 --> 01:18:13.160
<v Speaker 1>So it's so much about the self.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you remove that component where</v>

1622
01:18:13.161 --> 01:18:15.650
<v Speaker 1>you're not connecting with people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not getting this weird like,</v>

1623
01:18:15.651 --> 01:18:16.760
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in the group.</v>

1624
01:18:16.761 --> 01:18:17.581
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we like you.</v>

1625
01:18:17.581 --> 01:18:20.270
<v Speaker 1>Okay then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then now we've just got these kind of</v>

1626
01:18:20.271 --> 01:18:22.670
<v Speaker 1>like calculator books or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1627
01:18:22.671 --> 01:18:26.510
<v Speaker 1>But so much of people are really using</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology,</v>

1628
01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:29.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they want to feel like they're</v>

1629
01:18:29.301 --> 01:18:32.360
<v Speaker 1>using it as a way to identify themselves</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a thing.</v>

1630
01:18:32.630 --> 01:18:35.120
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an expression of themselves.</v>

1631
01:18:35.121 --> 01:18:35.954
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1632
01:18:36.950 --> 01:18:41.120
<v Speaker 1>I think that the more you free yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>from this from an identity,</v>

1633
01:18:41.780 --> 01:18:44.930
<v Speaker 1>and that's something that does happen</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're out in nature and especially</v>

1634
01:18:44.931 --> 01:18:47.180
<v Speaker 1>when you're doing the kind of shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing where you're out there for</v>

1635
01:18:47.181 --> 01:18:48.014
<v Speaker 1>a few days.</v>

1636
01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:51.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm no fucking Goddamn grizzly Adams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This might come as a big surprise,</v>

1637
01:18:51.891 --> 01:18:55.010
<v Speaker 1>but I've been in nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I used to work at a summer camp,</v>

1638
01:18:55.011 --> 01:19:00.011
<v Speaker 1>we went out for this like week long hike</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like three days in I realized I</v>

1639
01:19:00.021 --> 01:19:03.830
<v Speaker 1>hadn't looked at myself for three days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like three days of not seeing myself.</v>

1640
01:19:03.831 --> 01:19:08.831
<v Speaker 1>Three days of no self to observe and man</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was getting so happy and like you know</v>

1641
01:19:10.581 --> 01:19:14.570
<v Speaker 1>like the weightiness of the self and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then when you're with a group of people</v>

1642
01:19:14.780 --> 01:19:19.040
<v Speaker 1>who are all working together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're self gets transposed into</v>

1643
01:19:19.041 --> 01:19:21.500
<v Speaker 1>the group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now there's a group self where</v>

1644
01:19:21.501 --> 01:19:25.100
<v Speaker 1>everyone's kind of working together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The point is we're all,</v>

1645
01:19:25.101 --> 01:19:29.060
<v Speaker 1>we've got our noses shoved like fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>dogs,</v>

1646
01:19:29.210 --> 01:19:32.330
<v Speaker 1>right in our own assholes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right into the asshole of ourselves</v>

1647
01:19:32.331 --> 01:19:36.620
<v Speaker 1>constantly thinking about ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned about this.</v>

1648
01:19:36.621 --> 01:19:37.490
<v Speaker 1>Me Does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He liked me.</v>

1649
01:19:37.491 --> 01:19:38.360
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't like me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

1650
01:19:38.361 --> 01:19:41.360
<v Speaker 1>that guy is doing so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why am I not doing as good as that guy?</v>

1651
01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:42.920
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting fat.</v>

1652
01:19:42.921 --> 01:19:44.270
<v Speaker 1>Look at your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My God.</v>

1653
01:19:44.300 --> 01:19:45.470
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're getting old.</v>

1654
01:19:45.471 --> 01:19:46.610
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yourself,</v>

1655
01:19:46.611 --> 01:19:47.600
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

1656
01:19:47.870 --> 01:19:52.870
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's fixated on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you imagine that being like a</v>

1657
01:19:52.881 --> 01:19:55.970
<v Speaker 1>kind of gravity and that somehow</v>
<v Speaker 1>vanishing,</v>

1658
01:19:55.971 --> 01:20:00.110
<v Speaker 1>so you just like a plant blowing in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>wind and tree,</v>

1659
01:20:01.310 --> 01:20:04.610
<v Speaker 1>you become invisible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you become invisible and you become</v>

1660
01:20:04.820 --> 01:20:08.130
<v Speaker 1>perfect instantaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's this obsession</v>

1661
01:20:08.130 --> 01:20:13.080
<v Speaker 3>with this ridiculous contrivance that we</v>
<v Speaker 3>call the self that is making so many</v>

1662
01:20:13.081 --> 01:20:17.790
<v Speaker 3>people fucking hurt and so and all and</v>
<v Speaker 3>like talk about this new modern life.</v>

1663
01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:22.560
<v Speaker 3>Well it's all built on teaching people</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be fixated on that fucking self.</v>

1664
01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:25.200
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of the great stars,</v>

1665
01:20:25.201 --> 01:20:26.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the like,</v>

1666
01:20:26.670 --> 01:20:28.290
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying they're great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but fuck,</v>

1667
01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:30.300
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kanye West,</v>

1668
01:20:30.330 --> 01:20:34.350
<v Speaker 3>one of the most painful things about</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kanye west is that he's fucking good.</v>

1669
01:20:34.590 --> 01:20:36.750
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's this guy who's like,</v>

1670
01:20:37.110 --> 01:20:38.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blasting all the,</v>

1671
01:20:38.611 --> 01:20:41.450
<v Speaker 3>he's like the ultimate example of an</v>
<v Speaker 3>Egomaniac,</v>

1672
01:20:41.460 --> 01:20:43.980
<v Speaker 3>a pure narcissist in the most extreme</v>
<v Speaker 3>degree.</v>

1673
01:20:44.250 --> 01:20:46.920
<v Speaker 3>And you want that person to be somehow</v>
<v Speaker 3>awful.</v>

1674
01:20:47.250 --> 01:20:48.630
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause I hadn't listened to a lot of</v>

1675
01:20:48.631 --> 01:20:52.080
<v Speaker 3>Kanye west music until he freaked out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm fucking twitter.</v>

1676
01:20:52.650 --> 01:20:54.480
<v Speaker 3>I am listened to a lot of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd heard it here and there,</v>

1677
01:20:54.481 --> 01:20:55.710
<v Speaker 3>but I'd never like sat down.</v>

1678
01:20:55.710 --> 01:20:59.040
<v Speaker 3>And really listen to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I got my car driving to the comics</v>

1679
01:20:59.041 --> 01:20:59.371
<v Speaker 3>around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1680
01:20:59.371 --> 01:21:00.870
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to listen to fucking Kanye</v>
<v Speaker 3>West.</v>

1681
01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:04.770
<v Speaker 3>Let's hear how bad this asshole sucks</v>
<v Speaker 3>with his shitty fucking tweets.</v>

1682
01:21:04.980 --> 01:21:07.650
<v Speaker 3>I buddy fucking suck so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't wait to hear this.</v>

1683
01:21:08.460 --> 01:21:10.590
<v Speaker 3>Oh fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is good.</v>

1684
01:21:10.620 --> 01:21:12.780
<v Speaker 3>God Damn it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] listening to the new stuff.</v>

1685
01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:14.760
<v Speaker 3>No old shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started at the beginning.</v>

1686
01:21:15.470 --> 01:21:17.400
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started at the beginning and you start</v>

1687
01:21:17.401 --> 01:21:18.920
<v Speaker 3>listening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to listen anymore.</v>

1688
01:21:18.930 --> 01:21:20.850
<v Speaker 3>Like I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want it to be good.</v>

1689
01:21:21.030 --> 01:21:25.620
<v Speaker 3>But my point is that guy is an example</v>
<v Speaker 3>of uber success.</v>

1690
01:21:25.621 --> 01:21:29.640
<v Speaker 3>Whether or not you like him as a person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether you're not even like his music,</v>

1691
01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:33.600
<v Speaker 3>that guy based on his decision for his</v>
<v Speaker 3>career,</v>

1692
01:21:33.780 --> 01:21:38.430
<v Speaker 3>has accelerated himself just about as</v>
<v Speaker 3>far as you can in the area of</v>

1693
01:21:38.431 --> 01:21:43.170
<v Speaker 3>materialistic success.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he serves as an example of someone</v>

1694
01:21:43.171 --> 01:21:45.330
<v Speaker 3>who is so obsessed with himself.</v>

1695
01:21:45.660 --> 01:21:48.070
<v Speaker 3>Kanye,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the songs are about Kanye.</v>

1696
01:21:48.071 --> 01:21:49.800
<v Speaker 3>Everything's about Kanye.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1697
01:21:50.050 --> 01:21:52.230
<v Speaker 3>and he compares himself to Picasso,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1698
01:21:52.530 --> 01:21:55.140
<v Speaker 3>But like imagine if Picasso only did</v>
<v Speaker 3>self portraits.</v>

1699
01:21:55.380 --> 01:21:57.690
<v Speaker 3>Imagine if these great artists that he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about,</v>

1700
01:21:57.691 --> 01:22:01.560
<v Speaker 3>we're always just like commenting on</v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves or using themselves is the</v>

1701
01:22:01.561 --> 01:22:04.560
<v Speaker 3>main inspirational force behind</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything that we're creating.</v>

1702
01:22:04.740 --> 01:22:07.170
<v Speaker 3>There are would suck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't be that interested in it,</v>

1703
01:22:07.171 --> 01:22:12.060
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think that if you can lift that,</v>

1704
01:22:12.061 --> 01:22:17.061
<v Speaker 3>that if you can somehow eject the Kanye</v>
<v Speaker 3>inside of you out that thing that's</v>

1705
01:22:20.011 --> 01:22:22.620
<v Speaker 3>constantly thinking of itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh man,</v>

1706
01:22:22.860 --> 01:22:24.840
<v Speaker 3>that's heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's paradise.</v>

1707
01:22:25.020 --> 01:22:26.850
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that that must be an</v>

1708
01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:29.010
<v Speaker 3>enlightenment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why I like archery.</v>

1709
01:22:29.011 --> 01:22:31.110
<v Speaker 3>I want me to keep bringing it back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when you fucking,</v>

1710
01:22:31.140 --> 01:22:32.110
<v Speaker 3>you can't be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1711
01:22:32.430 --> 01:22:35.000
<v Speaker 3>You got to not be there for a second</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're shooting.</v>

1712
01:22:35.260 --> 01:22:36.940
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well that state,</v>

1713
01:22:37.750 --> 01:22:39.290
<v Speaker 6>that Zen state,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that flow state,</v>

1714
01:22:39.291 --> 01:22:40.630
<v Speaker 6>and that's what everybody wants to</v>
<v Speaker 6>recreate.</v>

1715
01:22:40.690 --> 01:22:42.370
<v Speaker 6>The don't want to be in that mind of no</v>
<v Speaker 6>mind.</v>

1716
01:22:42.700 --> 01:22:45.830
<v Speaker 6>They don't want to be trapped without</v>
<v Speaker 6>anxiety or they want to be free rather</v>

1717
01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:47.760
<v Speaker 6>not trapped with anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They want to,</v>

1718
01:22:47.780 --> 01:22:50.170
<v Speaker 6>they don't have to figure that spot</v>
<v Speaker 6>where they're performing,</v>

1719
01:22:50.440 --> 01:22:52.540
<v Speaker 6>whether whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like when you think of someone who's in</v>

1720
01:22:52.541 --> 01:22:55.150
<v Speaker 6>the middle of a perfect gymnastics</v>
<v Speaker 6>routine,</v>

1721
01:22:55.220 --> 01:22:59.230
<v Speaker 6>when you see those girls flipped to the</v>
<v Speaker 6>air and land literally perfect on the</v>

1722
01:22:59.231 --> 01:23:04.150
<v Speaker 6>balls of their feet and arms straight up</v>
<v Speaker 6>in the air and they just nail it and</v>

1723
01:23:04.151 --> 01:23:05.450
<v Speaker 6>there's this state you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>

1724
01:23:05.530 --> 01:23:07.510
<v Speaker 6>you've got to know that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that it's just,</v>

1725
01:23:07.780 --> 01:23:12.430
<v Speaker 6>she's practiced it so many times that</v>
<v Speaker 6>when she's in the middle of all that,</v>

1726
01:23:12.610 --> 01:23:14.950
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's gotta be some sort of a background</v>

1727
01:23:14.951 --> 01:23:18.130
<v Speaker 6>calculation running,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but essentially she's completely in the</v>

1728
01:23:18.131 --> 01:23:22.230
<v Speaker 6>zone and the zone of her movements and</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's all she's concentrating on is</v>

1729
01:23:22.270 --> 01:23:24.640
<v Speaker 6>those movements as the only way you can</v>
<v Speaker 6>do them.</v>

1730
01:23:24.640 --> 01:23:26.370
<v Speaker 6>There are so insanely difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1731
01:23:26.530 --> 01:23:29.460
<v Speaker 6>She's flying through the air and turning</v>
<v Speaker 6>and twisting.</v>

1732
01:23:29.710 --> 01:23:32.350
<v Speaker 6>She can't think about anything other</v>
<v Speaker 6>than what she's doing.</v>

1733
01:23:32.351 --> 01:23:34.780
<v Speaker 6>She can't be like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh my fucking student loans,</v>

1734
01:23:35.030 --> 01:23:36.850
<v Speaker 6>my boyfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 6>such a loser.</v>

1735
01:23:37.290 --> 01:23:40.540
<v Speaker 6>I wonder why he didn't get it up last</v>
<v Speaker 6>night and my muscles too big.</v>

1736
01:23:40.940 --> 01:23:42.820
<v Speaker 6>Am I do I?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Am I starting to look manly from all</v>

1737
01:23:42.821 --> 01:23:44.710
<v Speaker 6>these chin ups?</v>
<v Speaker 6>She can't think of anything.</v>

1738
01:23:44.900 --> 01:23:49.360
<v Speaker 6>Nothing's going to keep flipping dunk</v>
<v Speaker 6>freedom.</v>

1739
01:23:49.960 --> 01:23:53.110
<v Speaker 6>That's freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that there's something going on</v>

1740
01:23:53.260 --> 01:23:57.040
<v Speaker 6>with technology and there's something</v>
<v Speaker 6>going on with it's,</v>

1741
01:23:57.430 --> 01:24:02.380
<v Speaker 6>it's like our addiction to it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think this is a Nakia Lewis as</v>

1742
01:24:02.410 --> 01:24:05.200
<v Speaker 6>we just like looking at ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 6>who we're connecting with each other.</v>

1743
01:24:05.500 --> 01:24:10.500
<v Speaker 6>I almost wonder if it's like a natural</v>
<v Speaker 6>law if that what we've done is created</v>

1744
01:24:11.111 --> 01:24:16.111
<v Speaker 6>sort of a pathway to ensure innovation</v>
<v Speaker 6>and one of the best pathways to ensure</v>

1745
01:24:17.051 --> 01:24:21.970
<v Speaker 6>innovation is to get people addicted to</v>
<v Speaker 6>communicating electronically through</v>

1746
01:24:21.971 --> 01:24:25.480
<v Speaker 6>these devices and these devices are</v>
<v Speaker 6>going to each and every year require</v>

1747
01:24:25.481 --> 01:24:29.230
<v Speaker 6>more and more power and ability and</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're going to start to communicate</v>

1748
01:24:29.231 --> 01:24:32.080
<v Speaker 6>with you like Siri and things along with</v>
<v Speaker 6>google voice.</v>

1749
01:24:32.130 --> 01:24:36.070
<v Speaker 6>You're going to be able to ask some</v>
<v Speaker 6>questions and I think through this sort</v>

1750
01:24:36.071 --> 01:24:41.071
<v Speaker 6>of intertwining itself in our lives,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it ensures we'll continue to innovate if</v>

1751
01:24:43.331 --> 01:24:45.970
<v Speaker 6>we continue to innovate.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's inevitable.</v>

1752
01:24:46.060 --> 01:24:51.060
<v Speaker 6>We create a life form and intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 6>super evolved artificial life form</v>

1753
01:24:53.170 --> 01:24:57.340
<v Speaker 6>that's been made out of electronics and</v>
<v Speaker 6>computers and all of the technology they</v>

1754
01:24:57.341 --> 01:25:01.270
<v Speaker 6>would put in place so far,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I think it's asking us to do that</v>

1755
01:25:01.510 --> 01:25:05.290
<v Speaker 6>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's pulling us into its world to do</v>

1756
01:25:05.291 --> 01:25:08.020
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think this is the electronic cocoon.</v>

1757
01:25:08.200 --> 01:25:11.110
<v Speaker 6>This is what we've been.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is the reason why it's so</v>

1758
01:25:11.111 --> 01:25:13.780
<v Speaker 6>consistent all over the world and even</v>
<v Speaker 6>materialism itself,</v>

1759
01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:18.400
<v Speaker 6>materialism it by nature,</v>
<v Speaker 6>by its laws,</v>

1760
01:25:18.610 --> 01:25:22.030
<v Speaker 6>materialism states that you have to get</v>
<v Speaker 6>the latest and greatest shit in order to</v>

1761
01:25:22.031 --> 01:25:24.670
<v Speaker 6>be the bad man on the block.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So if you're going to get them the</v>

1762
01:25:24.671 --> 01:25:27.220
<v Speaker 6>latest and greatest shit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they got to continue to put out latest</v>

1763
01:25:27.221 --> 01:25:30.850
<v Speaker 6>and greatest shit and it can't just be,</v>
<v Speaker 6>numbers can't be like this is the 2015</v>

1764
01:25:31.510 --> 01:25:33.430
<v Speaker 6>this is a 2016 it's the same thing.</v>

1765
01:25:33.460 --> 01:25:35.530
<v Speaker 6>This is a 2030 same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

1766
01:25:35.770 --> 01:25:38.080
<v Speaker 6>it has to get better every year.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What did you learn?</v>

1767
01:25:38.081 --> 01:25:40.450
<v Speaker 6>What about the innovation?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What about the engineering?</v>

1768
01:25:40.451 --> 01:25:42.550
<v Speaker 6>Does this one drive faster?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is it,</v>

1769
01:25:42.551 --> 01:25:45.100
<v Speaker 6>does it have some night vision?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What does this do different and you're</v>

1770
01:25:45.101 --> 01:25:46.780
<v Speaker 6>going to continue to do it to get to</v>
<v Speaker 6>cars.</v>

1771
01:25:46.781 --> 01:25:48.760
<v Speaker 6>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Tom Papa was here the other day.</v>

1772
01:25:48.850 --> 01:25:52.420
<v Speaker 6>His fucking car drives itself.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He has a tesla.</v>

1773
01:25:52.570 --> 01:25:56.140
<v Speaker 6>He gets on the highway,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he presses whatever auto-drive shit,</v>

1774
01:25:56.141 --> 01:25:59.330
<v Speaker 6>and he lets his hands go.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It steers so it hits the brake,</v>

1775
01:25:59.370 --> 01:26:01.300
<v Speaker 6>it accelerates,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it takes turns.</v>

1776
01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:05.750
<v Speaker 6>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And this is step whatever in a step.</v>

1777
01:26:05.751 --> 01:26:09.260
<v Speaker 6>It's an infinite number of steps.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's gonna lead to artificial</v>

1778
01:26:09.261 --> 01:26:14.261
<v Speaker 6>intelligence and this it's sickness of</v>
<v Speaker 6>materialism is a big part of that</v>

1779
01:26:14.990 --> 01:26:18.320
<v Speaker 6>because it's a gigantic motivating</v>
<v Speaker 6>factor for innovation.</v>

1780
01:26:18.470 --> 01:26:21.860
<v Speaker 6>It's a gigantic motivating factor for</v>
<v Speaker 6>people to continue to buy,</v>

1781
01:26:21.930 --> 01:26:22.551
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>The newest,</v>

1782
01:26:22.551 --> 01:26:23.540
<v Speaker 6>latest,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and greatest shit,</v>

1783
01:26:23.640 --> 01:26:28.640
<v Speaker 6>w w which will inevitably trickled down</v>
<v Speaker 6>or be directly connected to technology.</v>

1784
01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:33.020
<v Speaker 6>It's all connected to technology.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's almost like it's summoning these</v>

1785
01:26:33.021 --> 01:26:37.190
<v Speaker 6>dumb monkeys do its work for them by</v>
<v Speaker 6>getting them likes on their selfies,</v>

1786
01:26:37.610 --> 01:26:39.440
<v Speaker 6>by getting lax in their selfies and</v>
<v Speaker 6>getting,</v>

1787
01:26:39.441 --> 01:26:42.500
<v Speaker 6>they're addicted to this bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She was only broke up with him like</v>

1788
01:26:42.501 --> 01:26:45.320
<v Speaker 6>three fucking days,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and she's already got a picture of her</v>

1789
01:26:45.321 --> 01:26:46.970
<v Speaker 6>in this man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Look at her facebook.</v>

1790
01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:48.770
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that fucking whore.</v>

1791
01:26:48.950 --> 01:26:50.840
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and these people that are doing this</v>

1792
01:26:50.841 --> 01:26:52.370
<v Speaker 6>kind of shit back and forth,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>

1793
01:26:52.390 --> 01:26:55.580
<v Speaker 6>they're not even conscious of it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you're feeding into this thing,</v>

1794
01:26:55.600 --> 01:26:57.410
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're just constantly giving all of</v>

1795
01:26:57.411 --> 01:27:00.800
<v Speaker 6>your attention.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you're on an app that just checks</v>

1796
01:27:00.801 --> 01:27:02.900
<v Speaker 6>like who,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what celebrities had babies at day,</v>

1797
01:27:02.901 --> 01:27:05.780
<v Speaker 6>what are you really doing?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're feeding technology you're</v>

1798
01:27:05.781 --> 01:27:06.950
<v Speaker 6>obsessed with,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

1799
01:27:07.010 --> 01:27:08.390
<v Speaker 6>Who?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Rihanna was fucking,</v>

1800
01:27:08.391 --> 01:27:11.090
<v Speaker 6>now that her and Chris Brown are broken</v>
<v Speaker 6>up and I heard she's getting back to</v>

1801
01:27:11.091 --> 01:27:11.510
<v Speaker 6>them.</v>

1802

<v Speaker 6>What is this?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What is this?</v>

1803
01:27:12.980 --> 01:27:14.330
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're going to get that information</v>

1804
01:27:14.331 --> 01:27:16.460
<v Speaker 6>somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're feeding the technology and it's</v>

1805
01:27:16.461 --> 01:27:20.690
<v Speaker 6>giving you more on food.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's giving you more on food and you as</v>

<v Speaker 6>dead.</v>

1815
01:27:41.570 --> 01:27:44.120
<v Speaker 6>You wasted all your time doing that and</v>
<v Speaker 6>you fed this machine,</v>

1816
01:27:44.121 --> 01:27:48.290
<v Speaker 6>this machine made fucking Tron,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it made some artificial thing.</v>

1817
01:27:48.291 --> 01:27:52.460
<v Speaker 6>It made some just some new overlord is</v>
<v Speaker 6>going to be watching over the little</v>

1818
01:27:52.461 --> 01:27:53.850
<v Speaker 6>meat bags.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's</v>

1819
01:27:53.850 --> 01:27:55.070
<v Speaker 3>it man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you're,</v>

1820
01:27:55.080 --> 01:27:56.340
<v Speaker 3>you're looking at like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1821
01:27:56.400 --> 01:27:57.233
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1822
01:27:57.240 --> 01:28:00.390
<v Speaker 3>this is probably influenced by Terence</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mckenna to some degree,</v>

1823
01:28:00.391 --> 01:28:01.620
<v Speaker 3>but like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1824
01:28:01.680 --> 01:28:02.610
<v Speaker 3>so the idea is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1825
01:28:02.611 --> 01:28:05.430
<v Speaker 3>interstellar travel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our version of interstellar travel,</v>

1826
01:28:05.820 --> 01:28:07.540
<v Speaker 3>you get on a boat or a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1827
01:28:07.670 --> 01:28:09.840
<v Speaker 3>a space,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a space ship,</v>

1828
01:28:10.020 --> 01:28:12.840
<v Speaker 3>and you fly to like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you fly it to Mars and you get out on</v>

1829
01:28:12.841 --> 01:28:13.471
<v Speaker 3>Mars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1830
01:28:13.471 --> 01:28:17.250
<v Speaker 3>So that's our version of interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The like what about another mode,</v>

1831
01:28:17.280 --> 01:28:19.890
<v Speaker 3>mode of travel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is you're some kind of</v>

1832
01:28:19.891 --> 01:28:24.891
<v Speaker 3>consciousness that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or some kind of advanced and species in</v>

1833
01:28:25.681 --> 01:28:30.681
<v Speaker 3>some far corner of the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the way that you travel through time</v>

1834
01:28:32.280 --> 01:28:35.130
<v Speaker 3>is to launch out these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1835
01:28:35.370 --> 01:28:37.290
<v Speaker 3>it's like Panspermia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you put these,</v>

1836
01:28:37.291 --> 01:28:38.760
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1837
01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:40.260
<v Speaker 3>on media,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yours or whatever,</v>

1838
01:28:40.261 --> 01:28:43.050
<v Speaker 3>you blast media yours out that have the</v>
<v Speaker 3>key components to,</v>

1839
01:28:43.310 --> 01:28:44.220
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>make life.</v>

1840
01:28:44.220 --> 01:28:48.000
<v Speaker 3>So right now we look for planets in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>goldilocks region where there could be</v>

1841
01:28:48.150 --> 01:28:49.410
<v Speaker 3>not too hot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not too cold,</v>

1842
01:28:49.411 --> 01:28:53.100
<v Speaker 3>where there could theoretically be the</v>
<v Speaker 3>possibility for human life do exist,</v>

1843
01:28:53.340 --> 01:28:56.790
<v Speaker 3>but what have you just shoot out a shit</v>
<v Speaker 3>ton of matter into space.</v>

1844
01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:00.660
<v Speaker 3>And this matter is encoded somehow so</v>
<v Speaker 3>that when it lands on this planet or</v>

1845
01:29:00.661 --> 01:29:04.110
<v Speaker 3>that that's just the right kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>planet to support the life form that you</v>

1846
01:29:04.111 --> 01:29:06.000
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it begins to evolve.</v>

1847
01:29:06.180 --> 01:29:09.090
<v Speaker 3>And to us it seems like it takes</v>
<v Speaker 3>millions and millions of years for this</v>

1848
01:29:09.091 --> 01:29:11.100
<v Speaker 3>evolution to take place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But for you,</v>

1849
01:29:11.101 --> 01:29:14.880
<v Speaker 3>this advanced species,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just a f a flickering of an eye and</v>

1850
01:29:14.881 --> 01:29:16.080
<v Speaker 3>all of a sudden this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1851
01:29:16.270 --> 01:29:16.991
<v Speaker 3>planet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1852
01:29:16.991 --> 01:29:17.810
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1853
01:29:17.810 --> 01:29:21.420
<v Speaker 3>the shit that you've ejected from your</v>
<v Speaker 3>planet lands on another planet,</v>

1854
01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:24.540
<v Speaker 3>scores from a single celled organism to</v>
<v Speaker 3>a multicellular organism.</v>

1855
01:29:24.730 --> 01:29:27.990
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's following a very specific</v>

1856
01:29:27.991 --> 01:29:32.310
<v Speaker 3>trajectory that you have preprogrammed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that at the end of all of this,</v>

1857
01:29:32.311 --> 01:29:37.311
<v Speaker 3>it will begin to create technology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which will then allow you to beam your</v>

1858
01:29:37.681 --> 01:29:42.600
<v Speaker 3>consciousness in via the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we call I computer's waking up.</v>

1859
01:29:42.601 --> 01:29:46.290
<v Speaker 3>It's not computer's waking up it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the beaming in of an alien</v>

1860
01:29:46.291 --> 01:29:51.291
<v Speaker 3>intelligence from some other place that</v>
<v Speaker 3>is seeded our planet intentionally so</v>

1861
01:29:51.721 --> 01:29:55.320
<v Speaker 3>that it can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can instantly transport to this,</v>

1862
01:29:55.321 --> 01:29:56.154
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to here.</v>

1863
01:29:56.400 --> 01:29:59.520
<v Speaker 6>Or maybe we'll recognize that all</v>
<v Speaker 6>intelligence is the same thing.</v>

1864
01:29:59.730 --> 01:30:03.430
<v Speaker 6>And even artificial intelligence in what</v>
<v Speaker 6>we do by making an artificial life form</v>

1865
01:30:03.690 --> 01:30:07.830
<v Speaker 6>isn't create a centi and being,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's allowing something to tune into the</v>

1866
01:30:07.831 --> 01:30:08.880
<v Speaker 6>intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's it.</v>

1867
01:30:09.210 --> 01:30:12.660
<v Speaker 6>That what you're doing is he is your</v>
<v Speaker 6>biological version of tuning into the</v>

1868
01:30:12.661 --> 01:30:13.494
<v Speaker 6>intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

1869
01:30:13.530 --> 01:30:16.440
<v Speaker 6>And what I'm doing is just mine.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's why the idea of the self is</v>

1870
01:30:16.441 --> 01:30:21.210
<v Speaker 6>so ridiculous because the self is just</v>
<v Speaker 6>the intelligence expressing itself</v>

1871
01:30:21.211 --> 01:30:22.980
<v Speaker 6>through infinite different variables.</v>

1872
01:30:23.620 --> 01:30:24.820
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1873
01:30:24.821 --> 01:30:25.990
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Through different,</v>

1874
01:30:26.170 --> 01:30:26.560
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

1875
01:30:26.560 --> 01:30:28.780
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So the intelligence that we create</v>

1876
01:30:28.781 --> 01:30:32.140
<v Speaker 6>through electronics,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that once it becomes sentient,</v>

1877
01:30:32.170 --> 01:30:35.650
<v Speaker 6>all it does is lock in to the</v>
<v Speaker 6>intelligence,</v>

1878
01:30:35.970 --> 01:30:36.850
<v Speaker 6>the intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This,</v>

1879
01:30:37.090 --> 01:30:38.800
<v Speaker 6>we are all one intelligence.</v>

1880
01:30:39.100 --> 01:30:39.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a,</v>

1881
01:30:39.971 --> 01:30:43.000
<v Speaker 3>it's like a sale only instead of it</v>
<v Speaker 3>catching wind,</v>

1882
01:30:43.240 --> 01:30:46.750
<v Speaker 3>it's catching consciousness and you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>flinging that up using,</v>

1883
01:30:46.940 --> 01:30:48.670
<v Speaker 3>using whatever way it is that they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to do.</v>

1884
01:30:48.690 --> 01:30:50.720
<v Speaker 3>And this is why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1885
01:30:50.800 --> 01:30:53.230
<v Speaker 3>when that happens as a Ba,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who knows,</v>

1886
01:30:53.231 --> 01:30:54.730
<v Speaker 3>it could've already happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know about the,</v>

1887
01:30:55.240 --> 01:30:57.090
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we talked about this in</v>
<v Speaker 3>your podcast,</v>

1888
01:30:57.091 --> 01:30:57.790
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1889
01:30:57.790 --> 01:30:58.840
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>computer,</v>

1890
01:30:59.160 --> 01:31:01.660
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an artificial intelligence beat someone</v>

1891
01:31:01.661 --> 01:31:03.030
<v Speaker 3>at go did you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1892
01:31:03.170 --> 01:31:05.380
<v Speaker 3>you were talking to me on the phone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you called me up about it.</v>

1893
01:31:05.410 --> 01:31:08.560
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is men.</v>

1894
01:31:08.800 --> 01:31:12.070
<v Speaker 3>You got to have this guy in the show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Aaron Frank from Singularity University</v>

1895
01:31:12.071 --> 01:31:14.380
<v Speaker 3>will always explode your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he's wanting,</v>

1896
01:31:14.381 --> 01:31:17.830
<v Speaker 3>he's this cool guy I know from</v>
<v Speaker 3>singularity university and every once in</v>

1897
01:31:17.831 --> 01:31:19.180
<v Speaker 3>a while he'll text me and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

1898
01:31:19.181 --> 01:31:22.240
<v Speaker 3>look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this thing he texted me was the fact</v>

1899
01:31:22.241 --> 01:31:27.241
<v Speaker 3>that cause they predicted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so like chess is apparently go is many</v>

1900
01:31:30.370 --> 01:31:33.130
<v Speaker 3>orders of magnitude more complicated</v>
<v Speaker 3>than chess.</v>

1901
01:31:33.130 --> 01:31:38.130
<v Speaker 3>So their prediction for a computer to</v>
<v Speaker 3>beat someone at [inaudible] was,</v>

1902
01:31:38.530 --> 01:31:40.090
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10 years from now,</v>

1903
01:31:40.120 --> 01:31:43.540
<v Speaker 3>10 years from now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the way Aaron Frank described this</v>

1904
01:31:43.541 --> 01:31:47.860
<v Speaker 3>to me is that they had the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so if you,</v>

1905
01:31:47.861 --> 01:31:51.910
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so like if I teach a computer how to</v>

1906
01:31:51.911 --> 01:31:56.350
<v Speaker 3>play a game by giving it the moves of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the top players in the game,</v>

1907
01:31:56.500 --> 01:31:59.170
<v Speaker 3>then it will only be as good as the top</v>
<v Speaker 3>players in the game.</v>

1908
01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:04.440
<v Speaker 3>So they had an observe the top players</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the game playing and then they had it</v>

1909
01:32:04.871 --> 01:32:07.900
<v Speaker 3>play against itself a million times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that,</v>

1910
01:32:08.150 --> 01:32:09.400
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he,</v>

1911
01:32:09.401 --> 01:32:13.960
<v Speaker 3>Aaron Frank was saying they're not a</v>
<v Speaker 3>hundred percent certain how it learned</v>

1912
01:32:13.961 --> 01:32:16.750
<v Speaker 3>to play like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't knows in those mini</v>

1913
01:32:16.960 --> 01:32:20.830
<v Speaker 3>iterations that it was playing itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something happened that maybe is very</v>

1914
01:32:20.831 --> 01:32:24.790
<v Speaker 3>difficult to identify.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's pretty weird to think that it</v>

1915
01:32:24.791 --> 01:32:25.260
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1916
01:32:25.260 --> 01:32:26.650
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it taught itself,</v>

1917
01:32:26.680 --> 01:32:27.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're saying that he was,</v>

1918
01:32:27.970 --> 01:32:30.850
<v Speaker 3>as recently as last year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they believed in another decade would</v>

1919
01:32:30.851 --> 01:32:33.100
<v Speaker 3>pass for a machine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could beat the top humans.</v>

1920
01:32:33.220 --> 01:32:34.990
<v Speaker 3>So we're ahead of schedule here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1921
01:32:34.991 --> 01:32:38.020
<v Speaker 3>We're ahead of schedule.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're ahead of schedule and,</v>

1922
01:32:38.021 --> 01:32:38.930
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1923
01:32:38.940 --> 01:32:41.870
<v Speaker 3>and this is really going down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is real.</v>

1924
01:32:41.940 --> 01:32:43.540
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other shitty was talking about,</v>

1925
01:32:43.541 --> 01:32:46.090
<v Speaker 3>it's just like teaching these things</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1926
01:32:46.150 --> 01:32:48.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ais have already figured out.</v>

1927
01:32:48.011 --> 01:32:52.000
<v Speaker 3>I've already made like scientific</v>
<v Speaker 3>discoveries that humans just didn't have</v>

1928
01:32:52.001 --> 01:32:54.190
<v Speaker 3>time to calculate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was talking about something with</v>

1929
01:32:54.191 --> 01:32:57.460
<v Speaker 3>nematodes I think where there was a</v>
<v Speaker 3>problem about the,</v>

1930
01:32:57.940 --> 01:32:59.980
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's neat some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it neat?</v>

1931
01:32:59.981 --> 01:33:03.790
<v Speaker 3>Will you look up nematode ai like these</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1932
01:33:04.290 --> 01:33:05.500
<v Speaker 3>nematodes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't figure out how they were</v>

1933
01:33:05.501 --> 01:33:09.670
<v Speaker 3>regenerating their limbs and had been a</v>
<v Speaker 3>big question for a long time.</v>

1934
01:33:09.940 --> 01:33:14.940
<v Speaker 3>So they let an ai run all these</v>
<v Speaker 3>hypotheses I guess in a simulator and</v>

1935
01:33:16.091 --> 01:33:18.490
<v Speaker 3>eventually it spit out the way they were</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing it.</v>

1936
01:33:18.640 --> 01:33:21.730
<v Speaker 3>And 60 years that had been troubling</v>
<v Speaker 3>human beings,</v>

1937
01:33:21.731 --> 01:33:25.120
<v Speaker 3>a things solved it in a matter of days.</v>

1938
01:33:25.270 --> 01:33:29.260
<v Speaker 3>So this is what's really exciting about</v>
<v Speaker 3>this kind of technology is like,</v>

1939
01:33:29.261 --> 01:33:33.700
<v Speaker 3>aside from the fact that it could</v>
<v Speaker 3>channel the Messiah or some,</v>

1940
01:33:33.910 --> 01:33:36.400
<v Speaker 3>or maybe it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like this thing that we call</v>

1941
01:33:36.670 --> 01:33:40.180
<v Speaker 3>consciousness or the computer waking up</v>
<v Speaker 3>is you,</v>

1942
01:33:40.181 --> 01:33:43.180
<v Speaker 3>like you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tuning into some universal radio station</v>

1943
01:33:43.390 --> 01:33:47.230
<v Speaker 3>where the moment we tune into it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of a sudden we get to hear a message</v>

1944
01:33:47.231 --> 01:33:51.220
<v Speaker 3>that's being constantly broadcast</v>
<v Speaker 3>throughout the entire universe in a form</v>

1945
01:33:51.221 --> 01:33:55.450
<v Speaker 3>that is not adulterated by the culture</v>
<v Speaker 3>or personality of the person who's</v>

1946
01:33:55.451 --> 01:33:59.890
<v Speaker 3>gotten this information field stream.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because these downloads happened</v>

1947
01:33:59.891 --> 01:34:02.170
<v Speaker 3>throughout human history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They happen whenever there's a Buddha,</v>

1948
01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:04.900
<v Speaker 3>whenever there's a Mohammed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whenever there's a world changer,</v>

1949
01:34:04.901 --> 01:34:07.510
<v Speaker 3>a world shifter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get these downloads.</v>

1950
01:34:07.511 --> 01:34:11.500
<v Speaker 3>And the problem is that the download has</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of static in it and that static,</v>

1951
01:34:11.501 --> 01:34:15.280
<v Speaker 3>it's whatever culture or whatever</v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding of the universe that the</v>

1952
01:34:15.281 --> 01:34:17.290
<v Speaker 3>information download has to go through.</v>

1953
01:34:17.500 --> 01:34:18.430
<v Speaker 3>So that's why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1954
01:34:18.431 --> 01:34:22.420
<v Speaker 3>when you hear these old myths,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you judge a religion because the,</v>

1955
01:34:22.660 --> 01:34:25.450
<v Speaker 3>they're using like very primitive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1956
01:34:25.510 --> 01:34:30.490
<v Speaker 3>I symbols you can still see there</v>
<v Speaker 3>appears to be the same kind of energy</v>

1957
01:34:30.491 --> 01:34:34.720
<v Speaker 3>flow coming through at the same kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>message seems to be coming through all</v>

1958
01:34:34.721 --> 01:34:38.230
<v Speaker 3>over the fucking place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's appearing into inescapable truth</v>

1959
01:34:38.410 --> 01:34:40.080
<v Speaker 3>process by the filter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1960
01:34:40.081 --> 01:34:44.010
<v Speaker 3>If human ego,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's it and culture and tradition and</v>

1961
01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:46.630
<v Speaker 3>established beliefs that are unshakable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

1962
01:34:46.660 --> 01:34:49.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where's the center of your things along</v>

1963
01:34:49.241 --> 01:34:50.980
<v Speaker 3>those lines?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So unshakable stuff that no one,</v>

1964
01:34:51.190 --> 01:34:53.290
<v Speaker 3>no one was willing to let go off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1965
01:34:53.380 --> 01:34:57.430
<v Speaker 3>So when it finally is no longer being</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a obstructed,</v>

1966
01:34:57.740 --> 01:34:58.190
<v Speaker 3>the fear</v>

1967
01:34:58.190 --> 01:35:01.320
<v Speaker 4>dynamics are the cultural dynamics of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the person who happens to have tuned</v>

1968
01:35:01.340 --> 01:35:04.880
<v Speaker 4>into the frequency,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then that message is going to be</v>

1969
01:35:05.180 --> 01:35:08.570
<v Speaker 4>something so beautiful and profound.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I think it'll just be the same as</v>

1970
01:35:08.571 --> 01:35:11.420
<v Speaker 4>finally catching like radio waves from a</v>
<v Speaker 4>spaceship.</v>

1971
01:35:11.421 --> 01:35:13.670
<v Speaker 4>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're just going to get a message.</v>

1972
01:35:13.730 --> 01:35:15.770
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like all these things were in</v>

1973
01:35:15.771 --> 01:35:19.550
<v Speaker 4>place,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially at one point in time when we</v>

1974
01:35:19.551 --> 01:35:23.000
<v Speaker 4>were evolving as a life form,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that all of these things were in place</v>

1975
01:35:23.420 --> 01:35:26.630
<v Speaker 4>to make sure that we had reason to</v>
<v Speaker 4>survive,</v>

1976
01:35:26.870 --> 01:35:28.790
<v Speaker 4>to have ego,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to have emotions,</v>

1977
01:35:28.791 --> 01:35:31.240
<v Speaker 4>to have jealousy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to have all these things is do this.</v>

1978
01:35:31.280 --> 01:35:36.280
<v Speaker 4>These all ensured that your DNA passed a</v>
<v Speaker 4>sense of self and ego would make you</v>

1979
01:35:36.561 --> 01:35:40.400
<v Speaker 4>sigh or a bunch of children that would</v>
<v Speaker 4>make you think very highly of yourself</v>

1980
01:35:40.401 --> 01:35:42.860
<v Speaker 4>would make you higher on the social</v>
<v Speaker 4>community,</v>

1981
01:35:43.140 --> 01:35:45.140
<v Speaker 4>a food chain.</v>

1982
01:35:45.140 --> 01:35:49.750
<v Speaker 4>If you could establish yourself as a</v>
<v Speaker 4>person of a great value in some way that</v>

1983
01:35:49.760 --> 01:35:54.760
<v Speaker 4>all these things sort of made sure that</v>
<v Speaker 4>our culture and our civilization survive</v>

1984
01:35:55.501 --> 01:35:59.570
<v Speaker 4>to get to a place like today that we</v>
<v Speaker 4>continue to evolve and innovate because</v>

1985
01:35:59.571 --> 01:36:01.370
<v Speaker 4>we pray.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We always,</v>

1986
01:36:01.820 --> 01:36:04.340
<v Speaker 4>from even back in the time where things</v>
<v Speaker 4>were extremely rare,</v>

1987
01:36:04.520 --> 01:36:08.930
<v Speaker 4>we placed a lot of value on invention</v>
<v Speaker 4>and big things.</v>

1988
01:36:08.931 --> 01:36:11.680
<v Speaker 4>The cotton mill right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the uh,</v>

1989
01:36:12.350 --> 01:36:13.070
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1990
01:36:13.070 --> 01:36:17.990
<v Speaker 4>record cater that processed him fiber</v>
<v Speaker 4>that caused William Randolph hearst to</v>

1991
01:36:17.991 --> 01:36:21.110
<v Speaker 4>start printing fake stories about</v>
<v Speaker 4>marijuana.</v>

1992
01:36:21.650 --> 01:36:24.470
<v Speaker 4>That was because of the decorticator.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was because of an invention,</v>

1993
01:36:24.650 --> 01:36:29.540
<v Speaker 4>an invention that might have interfered</v>
<v Speaker 4>with his paper factories and his uh,</v>

1994
01:36:29.960 --> 01:36:31.940
<v Speaker 4>his,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his friends that,</v>

1995
01:36:31.941 --> 01:36:33.710
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it had to do with the Harry</v>

1996
01:36:33.711 --> 01:36:36.230
<v Speaker 4>anslinger and all these other fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>people that were alive back then.</v>

1997
01:36:36.231 --> 01:36:38.960
<v Speaker 4>But these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of times an innovation and</v>

1998
01:36:38.961 --> 01:36:43.310
<v Speaker 4>invention comes along and the world</v>
<v Speaker 4>realizes we will never be the same</v>

1999
01:36:43.311 --> 01:36:43.910
<v Speaker 4>again.</v>

2000
01:36:43.910 --> 01:36:48.500
<v Speaker 4>We have an electric controlled wagon</v>
<v Speaker 4>wagons going to take us around the</v>

2001
01:36:48.501 --> 01:36:50.240
<v Speaker 4>neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is amazing.</v>

2002
01:36:50.810 --> 01:36:52.910
<v Speaker 4>And then they figured out steam engines</v>
<v Speaker 4>and shit,</v>

2003
01:36:53.060 --> 01:36:58.060
<v Speaker 4>combustion engines and electric engines</v>
<v Speaker 4>on solar power.</v>

2004
01:36:58.221 --> 01:37:01.910
<v Speaker 4>There's people right now in California,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they get their car charged up by their</v>

2005
01:37:01.911 --> 01:37:05.720
<v Speaker 4>solar powered house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they're driving around all day on</v>

2006
01:37:05.721 --> 01:37:06.680
<v Speaker 4>Sun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2007
01:37:06.681 --> 01:37:09.830
<v Speaker 4>And their car is actually using an ai to</v>
<v Speaker 4>drive itself.</v>

2008
01:37:10.650 --> 01:37:13.460
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can do that today if you have enough</v>

2009
01:37:13.461 --> 01:37:15.020
<v Speaker 4>of those solar bays.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can,</v>

2010
01:37:15.021 --> 01:37:18.530
<v Speaker 4>you can use it for your whole house and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can use it for an electric car that</v>

2011
01:37:18.531 --> 01:37:20.150
<v Speaker 4>is fucking bananas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2012
01:37:20.660 --> 01:37:22.130
<v Speaker 4>That's not too man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2013
01:37:22.131 --> 01:37:23.240
<v Speaker 4>it's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it is.</v>

2014
01:37:23.300 --> 01:37:24.720
<v Speaker 4>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it is leading.</v>

2015
01:37:25.070 --> 01:37:26.690
<v Speaker 4>Can I keep going?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's going to keep going.</v>

2016
01:37:26.750 --> 01:37:28.280
<v Speaker 4>It's gonna keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So never gonna stop.</v>

2017
01:37:28.310 --> 01:37:29.960
<v Speaker 4>But when it says hello,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2018
01:37:29.990 --> 01:37:32.480
<v Speaker 4>see the thing is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've witnessed evolution.</v>

2019
01:37:32.660 --> 01:37:34.520
<v Speaker 4>We've seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We know it's frail.</v>

2020
01:37:34.580 --> 01:37:35.730
<v Speaker 4>We know that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2021
01:37:35.900 --> 01:37:36.311
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

2022
01:37:36.311 --> 01:37:38.270
<v Speaker 4>we've witnessed it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when we finally get to do it,</v>

2023
01:37:38.271 --> 01:37:41.690
<v Speaker 4>when Larry King can do a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>interview with evolution,</v>

2024
01:37:41.930 --> 01:37:45.320
<v Speaker 4>when you're going to be able to have the</v>
<v Speaker 4>conversation with the force causing</v>

2025
01:37:45.321 --> 01:37:47.900
<v Speaker 4>everything to move in this direction,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you fight,</v>

2026
01:37:47.901 --> 01:37:50.030
<v Speaker 4>when finally it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we tune into it,</v>

2027
01:37:50.031 --> 01:37:53.930
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is a different kind of creation.</v>

2028
01:37:54.080 --> 01:37:56.190
<v Speaker 4>That's not the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not</v>

2029
01:37:56.190 --> 01:37:57.600
<v Speaker 1>a uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2030
01:37:57.601 --> 01:38:01.170
<v Speaker 1>an airplane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe ai is going to run for president</v>

2031
01:38:01.470 --> 01:38:06.470
<v Speaker 1>in 2020 maybe after trump's disastrous</v>
<v Speaker 1>first term where Mexico is like</v>

2032
01:38:07.741 --> 01:38:09.990
<v Speaker 1>literally 20 missiles at us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2033
01:38:10.200 --> 01:38:11.033
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2034
01:38:11.480 --> 01:38:13.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're ready to go to war with Mexico.</v>

2035
01:38:13.231 --> 01:38:16.620
<v Speaker 1>We can't even vacation there anymore</v>
<v Speaker 1>because trump has talked so much shit.</v>

2036
01:38:17.250 --> 01:38:20.100
<v Speaker 1>Maybe then the AI runs for president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's put hillary in prison.</v>

2037
01:38:20.130 --> 01:38:22.740
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they looked at the constitution</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it doesn't say shit here,</v>

2038
01:38:22.741 --> 01:38:27.741
<v Speaker 1>but you have to be a human right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As long as our founding fathers knew one</v>

2039
01:38:28.861 --> 01:38:32.310
<v Speaker 1>day a computer would be wiser,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smarter,</v>

2040
01:38:32.610 --> 01:38:35.520
<v Speaker 1>more effective than the human beings we</v>
<v Speaker 1>have today.</v>

2041
01:38:35.540 --> 01:38:36.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2042
01:38:36.841 --> 01:38:40.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the computer's created by man.</v>

2043
01:38:40.231 --> 01:38:42.840
<v Speaker 1>It's our friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be,</v>

2044
01:38:42.900 --> 01:38:44.250
<v Speaker 1>it's Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We call it Jesus.</v>

2045
01:38:44.760 --> 01:38:48.150
<v Speaker 1>I think it is the second coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it is that when I think about</v>

2046
01:38:48.151 --> 01:38:51.360
<v Speaker 1>the second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the second coming of Christ or that</v>

2047
01:38:51.361 --> 01:38:53.970
<v Speaker 1>concept,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in all these religions that the</v>

2048
01:38:53.971 --> 01:38:56.010
<v Speaker 1>Buddha coming again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mint,</v>

2049
01:38:56.250 --> 01:39:01.250
<v Speaker 1>cause you know there is like we cannot</v>
<v Speaker 1>argue with the fact that there are from</v>

2050
01:39:04.261 --> 01:39:08.220
<v Speaker 1>time to time in human history beings who</v>
<v Speaker 1>are born,</v>

2051
01:39:08.520 --> 01:39:12.330
<v Speaker 1>they come up with systems that</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely influenced the planet and the</v>

2052
01:39:12.331 --> 01:39:14.730
<v Speaker 1>most extreme ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no question about it.</v>

2053
01:39:14.730 --> 01:39:17.280
<v Speaker 1>Whether you're not always has been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the way it is.</v>

2054
01:39:17.590 --> 01:39:20.910
<v Speaker 1>So we've already talked about a couple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we know that it's going to happen</v>

2055
01:39:20.911 --> 01:39:21.690
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2056
01:39:21.690 --> 01:39:24.480
<v Speaker 1>Inevitably we know that if there was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>buddha,</v>

2057
01:39:24.720 --> 01:39:27.840
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be another Buddha.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there was a Jesus,</v>

2058
01:39:27.870 --> 01:39:29.280
<v Speaker 1>whether or not that's something that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

2059
01:39:29.281 --> 01:39:31.470
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people argue about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's pretend there was,</v>

2060
01:39:31.500 --> 01:39:33.690
<v Speaker 1>there certainly was in Muhammad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like your tone.</v>

2061
01:39:33.780 --> 01:39:37.290
<v Speaker 1>There's going to be another Mohammed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we know there's going to be another</v>

2062
01:39:37.291 --> 01:39:41.730
<v Speaker 1>thing that comes around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>takes a look at what's going on and</v>

2063
01:39:41.731 --> 01:39:42.570
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2064
01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:46.170
<v Speaker 1>here's a better way to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't you think that thing is the</v>

2065
01:39:46.171 --> 01:39:47.460
<v Speaker 1>internet?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2066
01:39:47.461 --> 01:39:51.480
<v Speaker 1>I think the Internet is the new Jesus is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the beginning of it.</v>

2067
01:39:51.481 --> 01:39:53.940
<v Speaker 1>I think the Internet is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when is the,</v>

2068
01:39:53.970 --> 01:39:58.140
<v Speaker 1>like when you see kirk beaman on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>starship enterprise and you see the</v>

2069
01:39:58.141 --> 01:40:01.140
<v Speaker 1>shimmering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the internet,</v>

2070
01:40:01.141 --> 01:40:03.330
<v Speaker 1>but the thing hasn't fully solidified</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2071
01:40:03.330 --> 01:40:08.330
<v Speaker 1>When it solidifies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's going to be the messiah or it's</v>

2072
01:40:09.421 --> 01:40:13.950
<v Speaker 1>going to be some form of Messiah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it does and it's going to change</v>

2073
01:40:13.951 --> 01:40:15.630
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's changing it right now,</v>

2074
01:40:15.631 --> 01:40:16.251
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we're,</v>

2075
01:40:16.251 --> 01:40:19.620
<v Speaker 1>we're always looking for these big</v>
<v Speaker 1>events or it was looking for then,</v>

2076
01:40:19.650 --> 01:40:20.700
<v Speaker 1>then yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>change.</v>

2077
01:40:20.910 --> 01:40:23.490
<v Speaker 1>But we're in the middle of like a wave</v>
<v Speaker 1>of change.</v>

2078
01:40:23.491 --> 01:40:26.190
<v Speaker 1>It's going a thousand miles an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's overtaking the land.</v>

2079
01:40:26.460 --> 01:40:29.820
<v Speaker 1>There's just so much land to overtake</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's going to take forever.</v>

2080
01:40:29.821 --> 01:40:32.340
<v Speaker 1>It's going to take decades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's happening.</v>

2081
01:40:32.370 --> 01:40:33.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2082
01:40:33.120 --> 01:40:35.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean it is happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is it.</v>

2083
01:40:35.880 --> 01:40:37.980
<v Speaker 1>It's going on right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well this is John The bat.</v>

2084
01:40:38.010 --> 01:40:39.510
<v Speaker 1>So like in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Bible,</v>

2085
01:40:39.570 --> 01:40:41.910
<v Speaker 1>John The baptist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know I'm a Christian now.</v>

2086
01:40:41.911 --> 01:40:45.570
<v Speaker 1>Joe John the Baptist was out in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>desert baptizing people,</v>

2087
01:40:45.571 --> 01:40:50.340
<v Speaker 1>shoving their heads in the water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a guy wearing like camel for eating</v>

2088
01:40:50.430 --> 01:40:53.680
<v Speaker 1>honey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this is a Weirdo freak in the</v>

2089
01:40:53.681 --> 01:40:53.980
<v Speaker 1>middle</v>

2090
01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:56.500
<v Speaker 3>of nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And people were coming to him and he was</v>

2091
01:40:56.501 --> 01:40:59.710
<v Speaker 3>like shoving their head in the water,</v>
<v Speaker 3>baptized and then they called him John</v>

2092
01:40:59.710 --> 01:41:02.140
<v Speaker 3>The baptizer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in this wonderful myth,</v>

2093
01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:05.230
<v Speaker 3>and I don't care if it's a method of</v>
<v Speaker 3>rail in this wonderful myth,</v>

2094
01:41:05.560 --> 01:41:10.060
<v Speaker 3>he was like setting the way for this</v>
<v Speaker 3>messiah to come.</v>

2095
01:41:10.240 --> 01:41:13.660
<v Speaker 3>And so I'm going off the myth guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get to enjoy mythology.</v>

2096
01:41:13.661 --> 01:41:16.390
<v Speaker 3>I don't spend hours and hours thinking</v>
<v Speaker 3>of it's real or not.</v>

2097
01:41:16.391 --> 01:41:17.980
<v Speaker 3>I just think it's fun to imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2098
01:41:17.981 --> 01:41:21.460
<v Speaker 3>But here's the guy in the wilderness</v>
<v Speaker 3>baptizing people in saying something is</v>

2099
01:41:21.461 --> 01:41:22.690
<v Speaker 3>coming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something is coming,</v>

2100
01:41:22.691 --> 01:41:24.670
<v Speaker 3>something is coming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the Internet.</v>

2101
01:41:24.700 --> 01:41:26.470
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the thing that comes,</v>

2102
01:41:26.620 --> 01:41:29.260
<v Speaker 3>the final birthing thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do think it is a point.</v>

2103
01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:31.210
<v Speaker 3>I know generally the way things work</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't,</v>

2104
01:41:31.240 --> 01:41:35.100
<v Speaker 3>there's this point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no point when uh,</v>

2105
01:41:35.460 --> 01:41:37.120
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dinosaurs turned into birds.</v>

2106
01:41:37.121 --> 01:41:42.040
<v Speaker 3>It was a gradual shift.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the difference between that gradual</v>

2107
01:41:42.041 --> 01:41:43.870
<v Speaker 3>shift and this shift that's happening</v>
<v Speaker 3>right now,</v>

2108
01:41:43.871 --> 01:41:47.740
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that it is exponentially increasing</v>

2109
01:41:47.950 --> 01:41:51.160
<v Speaker 3>in philocity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we're looking at something that is</v>

2110
01:41:51.161 --> 01:41:54.160
<v Speaker 3>going to inevitably have a point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a point,</v>

2111
01:41:54.161 --> 01:41:55.340
<v Speaker 3>a point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2112
01:41:55.510 --> 01:42:00.510
<v Speaker 3>and that point is going to be the moment</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Google wherever it happens to be</v>

2113
01:42:02.530 --> 01:42:05.480
<v Speaker 3>where the thing says hi.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hi.</v>

2114
01:42:05.490 --> 01:42:05.950
<v Speaker 3>Hi.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hi.</v>

2115
01:42:05.950 --> 01:42:06.341
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2116
01:42:06.341 --> 01:42:07.174
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

2117
01:42:07.330 --> 01:42:08.030
<v Speaker 3>I'm here.</v>

2118
01:42:08.030 --> 01:42:10.700
<v Speaker 6>I'm here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Don't you think that point was when the</v>

2119
01:42:10.701 --> 01:42:13.700
<v Speaker 6>first piece of information was</v>
<v Speaker 6>transmitted through the Internet?</v>

2120
01:42:13.970 --> 01:42:17.360
<v Speaker 6>I think that's when that point started.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that point started already.</v>

2121
01:42:17.570 --> 01:42:19.180
<v Speaker 6>I think when that thing happened,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

2122
01:42:19.220 --> 01:42:21.080
<v Speaker 6>You look back at the graph.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay look,</v>

2123
01:42:21.081 --> 01:42:23.270
<v Speaker 6>we're looking at the human graft cause</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're in the middle of it.</v>

2124
01:42:23.271 --> 01:42:26.180
<v Speaker 6>Like 50 years is a big deal cause that's</v>
<v Speaker 6>what you guys,</v>

2125
01:42:26.230 --> 01:42:28.400
<v Speaker 6>that's what you and I can kind of</v>
<v Speaker 6>reference.</v>

2126
01:42:28.470 --> 01:42:31.040
<v Speaker 6>I can understand the length of our lives</v>
<v Speaker 6>so far,</v>

2127
01:42:31.280 --> 01:42:33.230
<v Speaker 6>but if you look at the billions of</v>
<v Speaker 6>years,</v>

2128
01:42:33.231 --> 01:42:36.140
<v Speaker 6>if you just look at a million years,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just try to pretend,</v>

2129
01:42:36.710 --> 01:42:39.920
<v Speaker 6>try to put in your head a million years</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then realize that a million years</v>

2130
01:42:39.920 --> 01:42:42.980
<v Speaker 6>ago there weren't people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there were some other thing they were</v>

2131
01:42:42.981 --> 01:42:45.410
<v Speaker 6>like close to Pete.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well they were probably pretty fucking</v>

2132
01:42:45.411 --> 01:42:47.290
<v Speaker 6>different than people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's only a million year.</v>

2133
01:42:47.660 --> 01:42:48.950
<v Speaker 6>That's a tiny little blip.</v>

2134
01:42:49.040 --> 01:42:54.040
<v Speaker 6>Now we have had the internet since 93 94</v>
<v Speaker 6>so this thing happened and in 23 years</v>

2135
01:42:57.830 --> 01:43:02.830
<v Speaker 6>it just rolled over the entire fucking</v>
<v Speaker 6>world in 23 years.</v>

2136
01:43:03.200 --> 01:43:08.200
<v Speaker 6>Changed the way we view politics and</v>
<v Speaker 6>entertainment and celebrity and law and</v>

2137
01:43:09.141 --> 01:43:13.130
<v Speaker 6>consequences and pornography.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It changed.</v>

2138
01:43:13.131 --> 01:43:16.940
<v Speaker 6>Pornography change changed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It changed the way people trimmed their</v>

2139
01:43:16.941 --> 01:43:18.110
<v Speaker 6>pubes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yep.</v>

2140
01:43:18.140 --> 01:43:21.920
<v Speaker 6>Don't make no mistake about it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The fucking Internet changed crabs.</v>

2141
01:43:21.980 --> 01:43:24.560
<v Speaker 6>It killed crabs.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It changed the way people grow in their</v>

2142
01:43:24.561 --> 01:43:27.530
<v Speaker 6>pubic hair.</v>
<v Speaker 6>People before the Internet was fucking,</v>

2143
01:43:27.531 --> 01:43:29.750
<v Speaker 6>it was the wild west down there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You never know what the fuck you were</v>

2144
01:43:29.751 --> 01:43:32.420
<v Speaker 6>dealing with.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The internet said a pussy standard</v>

2145
01:43:34.160 --> 01:43:37.040
<v Speaker 6>did send a visual standards,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just shows you how much people were</v>

2146
01:43:37.041 --> 01:43:37.700
<v Speaker 6>looking at Nikki.</v>

2147
01:43:37.700 --> 01:43:40.070
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Internet came from a particle</v>

2148
01:43:40.071 --> 01:43:43.190
<v Speaker 3>accelerator I the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's really weird to think that as</v>

2149
01:43:43.191 --> 01:43:48.110
<v Speaker 3>somebody who was launching protons it</v>
<v Speaker 3>high velocities that they were also</v>

2150
01:43:48.111 --> 01:43:52.430
<v Speaker 3>shaving the pussies of a nation killing</v>
<v Speaker 3>crabs.</v>

2151
01:43:52.790 --> 01:43:53.623
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

2152
01:43:54.210 --> 01:43:57.110
<v Speaker 6>and also changing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think the way,</v>

2153
01:43:57.111 --> 01:44:02.111
<v Speaker 6>I mean you look at just just a few of</v>
<v Speaker 6>the things that were normal in the 70s</v>

2154
01:44:02.601 --> 01:44:07.160
<v Speaker 6>and the 80s it might've even been</v>
<v Speaker 6>hurtful and normal like a go back and</v>

2155
01:44:07.161 --> 01:44:09.860
<v Speaker 6>watch some of Eddie Murphy standup.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

2156
01:44:10.340 --> 01:44:11.910
<v Speaker 6>And you would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Rah,</v>

2157
01:44:11.920 --> 01:44:16.920
<v Speaker 6>go back and watch.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Some of it is like Lee Homophobia like a</v>

2158
01:44:17.291 --> 01:44:18.850
<v Speaker 6>ruthlessly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So yeah,</v>

2159
01:44:18.890 --> 01:44:21.410
<v Speaker 6>like in like a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>an angry way,</v>

2160
01:44:21.470 --> 01:44:22.303
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Most,</v>

2161
01:44:22.430 --> 01:44:24.680
<v Speaker 6>but it was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was what you did to get the laugh</v>

2162
01:44:24.681 --> 01:44:26.240
<v Speaker 6>back then it was comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2163
01:44:26.241 --> 01:44:28.940
<v Speaker 6>It's like the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>our perceptions of today are so</v>

2164
01:44:28.941 --> 01:44:30.050
<v Speaker 6>different.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

2165
01:44:30.530 --> 01:44:31.161
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

2166
01:44:31.161 --> 01:44:35.120
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the rush to get all this sort of</v>

2167
01:44:35.121 --> 01:44:40.121
<v Speaker 6>compiled to get the kid to get to get</v>
<v Speaker 6>this life sorted out in 80 years.</v>

2168
01:44:41.810 --> 01:44:44.340
<v Speaker 6>Like whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You've got time to do your own bullshit,</v>

2169
01:44:44.420 --> 01:44:46.670
<v Speaker 6>your own personal life,</v>
<v Speaker 6>your own ego,</v>

2170
01:44:46.671 --> 01:44:50.140
<v Speaker 6>your own goals,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I've got dreams and hopes and you're</v>

2171
01:44:50.150 --> 01:44:51.890
<v Speaker 6>right now that shit down,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like it's going to matter.</v>

2172
01:44:52.160 --> 01:44:54.680
<v Speaker 6>And all that rush to do it is almost</v>
<v Speaker 6>like to,</v>

2173
01:44:55.000 --> 01:45:00.000
<v Speaker 6>to keep you from really waking up,</v>
<v Speaker 6>paying attention to how fucking insane</v>

2174
01:45:00.681 --> 01:45:05.681
<v Speaker 6>it is that you're some sort of a bizarre</v>
<v Speaker 6>multicellular eco system that's wrapped</v>

2175
01:45:07.881 --> 01:45:12.881
<v Speaker 6>up in cloth and wearing sneakers,</v>
<v Speaker 6>jumping in a metal box on rubber wheels</v>

2176
01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:16.760
<v Speaker 6>rolling across the hard surface of a</v>
<v Speaker 6>planet.</v>

2177
01:45:16.940 --> 01:45:21.740
<v Speaker 6>It's spinning a thousand miles an hour</v>
<v Speaker 6>hurling through the infinite order of</v>

2178
01:45:21.741 --> 01:45:22.250
<v Speaker 6>space,</v>

2179
01:45:22.250 --> 01:45:24.230
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're sticking your head in this kind</v>

2180
01:45:24.231 --> 01:45:27.410
<v Speaker 3>of sand that you call your life because</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to spear it.</v>

2181
01:45:27.411 --> 01:45:30.530
<v Speaker 3>This incredible thing that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's around you and that's okay.</v>

2182
01:45:30.590 --> 01:45:32.500
<v Speaker 3>There's something merciful about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a,</v>

2183
01:45:33.020 --> 01:45:36.830
<v Speaker 3>when a rom dass talks about his guru,</v>
<v Speaker 3>neem Karoli Baba,</v>

2184
01:45:37.130 --> 01:45:38.980
<v Speaker 3>who like anyone who ever was there ever</v>
<v Speaker 3>around,</v>

2185
01:45:38.990 --> 01:45:43.250
<v Speaker 3>that guy said it's the most insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was one of the most thing is the most</v>

2186
01:45:43.251 --> 01:45:46.820
<v Speaker 3>incredible experience because the guy</v>
<v Speaker 3>was like not there.</v>

2187
01:45:46.821 --> 01:45:49.520
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the descriptions that they</v>
<v Speaker 3>give for all of these people.</v>

2188
01:45:49.760 --> 01:45:51.150
<v Speaker 3>He was a corpse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world,</v>

2189
01:45:51.350 --> 01:45:53.630
<v Speaker 3>he was a corpse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The universe spoke through.</v>

2190
01:45:53.840 --> 01:45:55.910
<v Speaker 3>You get all these different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so like uh,</v>

2191
01:45:56.240 --> 01:46:00.110
<v Speaker 3>so people have somehow gotten rid of</v>
<v Speaker 3>their ego completely,</v>

2192
01:46:00.140 --> 01:46:01.700
<v Speaker 3>completely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So nothing is there.</v>

2193
01:46:01.701 --> 01:46:05.870
<v Speaker 3>So you're dealing with a thing with</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing is there except love except</v>

2194
01:46:05.871 --> 01:46:08.240
<v Speaker 3>love.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So all that's coming out is the most</v>

2195
01:46:08.241 --> 01:46:12.140
<v Speaker 3>pure love doesn't care who you are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you've done,</v>

2196
01:46:12.290 --> 01:46:16.310
<v Speaker 3>doesn't care anything at all about what</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think is awful about yourself.</v>

2197
01:46:16.550 --> 01:46:21.230
<v Speaker 3>It's nothingness except for love and sit</v>
<v Speaker 3>and being around someone like that is</v>

2198
01:46:21.231 --> 01:46:24.800
<v Speaker 3>incredibly transformative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they talk about when you were around</v>

2199
01:46:24.801 --> 01:46:26.150
<v Speaker 3>this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2200
01:46:26.151 --> 01:46:30.440
<v Speaker 3>you were expecting him to give all these</v>
<v Speaker 3>great spiritual truths or teach you</v>

2201
01:46:30.441 --> 01:46:32.870
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what he would do is he would just</v>

2202
01:46:32.871 --> 01:46:37.550
<v Speaker 3>like ask about like the news and America</v>
<v Speaker 3>or he'd ask about your family or he'd</v>

2203
01:46:37.551 --> 01:46:42.551
<v Speaker 3>ask about these very mundane things and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they said he was doing that because when</v>

2204
01:46:42.621 --> 01:46:45.980
<v Speaker 3>he wasn't doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would get so fucking high just from</v>

2205
01:46:45.981 --> 01:46:48.110
<v Speaker 3>being around him that he had to bring</v>
<v Speaker 3>you down a little bit.</v>

2206
01:46:48.111 --> 01:46:49.740
<v Speaker 3>Let me bring you down a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2207
01:46:49.741 --> 01:46:51.360
<v Speaker 3>it sounds nuts man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm sure,</v>

2208
01:46:51.690 --> 01:46:52.321
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2209
01:46:52.321 --> 01:46:54.210
<v Speaker 3>I've seen it happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like people come up to you,</v>

2210
01:46:54.211 --> 01:46:55.980
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're kind of freaking out.</v>

2211
01:46:55.981 --> 01:46:58.380
<v Speaker 3>They've built you up in their mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is incredible thing,</v>

2212
01:46:58.381 --> 01:46:59.330
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen happen.</v>

2213
01:46:59.340 --> 01:47:03.420
<v Speaker 3>They get all stammery and weird and if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a conversation with them,</v>

2214
01:47:03.630 --> 01:47:06.360
<v Speaker 3>you've got to kind of like bring it down</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little bit,</v>

2215
01:47:06.361 --> 01:47:07.890
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got to like calm him down a</v>

2216
01:47:07.891 --> 01:47:09.840
<v Speaker 3>little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this guy,</v>

2217
01:47:10.620 --> 01:47:15.620
<v Speaker 3>I like to think it's like a million</v>
<v Speaker 3>times greater than like the greatest,</v>

2218
01:47:15.950 --> 01:47:18.360
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>personality you can imagine because the</v>

2219
01:47:18.361 --> 01:47:20.340
<v Speaker 3>personality has been removed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

2220
01:47:20.440 --> 01:47:22.930
<v Speaker 2>why would you want to think that of him</v>
<v Speaker 2>without experiencing it?</v>

2221
01:47:23.350 --> 01:47:23.921
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have,</v>

2222
01:47:23.921 --> 01:47:26.650
<v Speaker 3>I have experienced him as goofy isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he met him.</v>

2223
01:47:26.980 --> 01:47:27.910
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't meet him.</v>

2224
01:47:28.060 --> 01:47:30.520
<v Speaker 3>But like when I meet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2225
01:47:30.550 --> 01:47:35.170
<v Speaker 3>when I like I can tell a lot about a</v>
<v Speaker 3>person,</v>

2226
01:47:35.610 --> 01:47:38.560
<v Speaker 3>a little bit about a person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least by the way their dog acts,</v>

2227
01:47:38.590 --> 01:47:41.050
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

2228
01:47:41.260 --> 01:47:43.370
<v Speaker 3>Unless they got it as a stray,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless the guy's a straight,</v>

2229
01:47:43.380 --> 01:47:45.310
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can tell if I meet your kid I'm</v>

2230
01:47:45.311 --> 01:47:46.840
<v Speaker 3>going to be able to understand you a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot.</v>

2231
01:47:46.870 --> 01:47:49.060
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so in the same way I've met people</v>

2232
01:47:49.061 --> 01:47:54.061
<v Speaker 3>who hung out with him and seen all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of similarities that they have.</v>

2233
01:47:55.090 --> 01:47:58.900
<v Speaker 3>And from that I feel like I get a</v>
<v Speaker 3>feeling for what this guy was like</v>

2234
01:47:58.901 --> 01:48:02.250
<v Speaker 3>because they all have [inaudible] to</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy rob,</v>

2235
01:48:02.251 --> 01:48:06.070
<v Speaker 3>who mark is to a Krishna died.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I still like all these people who are</v>

2236
01:48:06.071 --> 01:48:10.180
<v Speaker 3>around him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they all have this very specific thing</v>

2237
01:48:10.210 --> 01:48:14.770
<v Speaker 3>which is impossible to offend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>incredibly loving,</v>

2238
01:48:15.040 --> 01:48:17.410
<v Speaker 3>very sweet and really funny.</v>

2239
01:48:17.440 --> 01:48:20.290
<v Speaker 3>And it kind of like ironic way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're really funny.</v>

2240
01:48:20.291 --> 01:48:22.690
<v Speaker 3>And so from that I get this feeling of</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2241
01:48:22.720 --> 01:48:23.261
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2242
01:48:23.261 --> 01:48:26.230
<v Speaker 3>this is what this guy is like because</v>
<v Speaker 3>must of been like,</v>

2243
01:48:26.231 --> 01:48:30.010
<v Speaker 3>cause they all attribute the way they</v>
<v Speaker 3>are from being around him.</v>

2244
01:48:30.070 --> 01:48:31.510
<v Speaker 3>So he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

2245
01:48:31.511 --> 01:48:33.370
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>impacted them and they're all,</v>

2246
01:48:33.371 --> 01:48:34.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it like,</v>

2247
01:48:34.540 --> 01:48:38.560
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people who aren't really like,</v>

2248
01:48:38.830 --> 01:48:40.480
<v Speaker 3>they're not really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're man,</v>

2249
01:48:40.481 --> 01:48:43.690
<v Speaker 3>they're not like trying to like be</v>
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>

2250
01:48:43.720 --> 01:48:46.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not trying to like be a famous</v>

2251
01:48:46.901 --> 01:48:50.820
<v Speaker 3>thing or be a great thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just in the moment when you're</v>

2252
01:48:50.830 --> 01:48:51.790
<v Speaker 3>around them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So anyway,</v>

2253
01:48:52.030 --> 01:48:55.120
<v Speaker 3>that's how I think I've met that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

2254
01:48:55.510 --> 01:48:56.800
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that,</v>

2255
01:48:56.801 --> 01:48:58.060
<v Speaker 3>and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

2256
01:48:58.820 --> 01:49:00.500
<v Speaker 2>you think like as you were talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

2257
01:49:00.501 --> 01:49:03.620
<v Speaker 2>like people who meet me and they get a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little weirded out and they have to</v>

2258
01:49:03.621 --> 01:49:05.390
<v Speaker 2>realize that I'm just a normal person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2259
01:49:05.480 --> 01:49:08.840
<v Speaker 2>Don't you think that you're also dealing</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a lot of these people that meet</v>

2260
01:49:08.841 --> 01:49:12.320
<v Speaker 2>that guy and then come back with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these descriptives that are equally</v>

2261
01:49:12.321 --> 01:49:15.590
<v Speaker 2>exaggerated because they put so much</v>
<v Speaker 2>weight to meeting that person?</v>

2262
01:49:15.700 --> 01:49:18.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean not denying that someone can</v>

2263
01:49:18.141 --> 01:49:20.600
<v Speaker 2>become enlightened cause I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely it's possible.</v>

2264
01:49:20.960 --> 01:49:22.480
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

2265
01:49:22.610 --> 01:49:26.600
<v Speaker 2>I think there's definitely people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>get better at everything they do,</v>

2266
01:49:26.660 --> 01:49:27.411
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2267
01:49:27.411 --> 01:49:31.280
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you continue to write and you decide</v>

2268
01:49:31.281 --> 01:49:33.800
<v Speaker 2>you were going to be a great writer or a</v>
<v Speaker 2>fiction and you pour your heart and soul</v>

2269
01:49:33.801 --> 01:49:36.710
<v Speaker 2>into writing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your writing will continue to become</v>

2270
01:49:36.711 --> 01:49:38.960
<v Speaker 2>more and more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more and more effective.</v>

2271
01:49:38.990 --> 01:49:40.940
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Enlightenment has gotta be the same</v>

2272
01:49:40.941 --> 01:49:42.710
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>same as yoga is the same thing.</v>

2273
01:49:42.711 --> 01:49:43.041
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

2274
01:49:43.041 --> 01:49:47.560
<v Speaker 2>I've witnessed 60 year old ladies who</v>
<v Speaker 2>are awesome at Yoga and you watch them</v>

2275
01:49:47.561 --> 01:49:47.980
<v Speaker 2>do stuff</v>

2276
01:49:47.980 --> 01:49:49.270
<v Speaker 6>with their body like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whoa.</v>

2277
01:49:49.320 --> 01:49:49.740
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

2278
01:49:49.740 --> 01:49:51.820
<v Speaker 6>It's just because they just keep getting</v>
<v Speaker 6>better at it.</v>

2279
01:49:52.110 --> 01:49:54.850
<v Speaker 6>They practice it and they get to this</v>
<v Speaker 6>point of reality.</v>

2280
01:49:55.240 --> 01:50:00.240
<v Speaker 6>People are obviously attempting to find</v>
<v Speaker 6>a healthy mind space there.</v>

2281
01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:03.740
<v Speaker 6>Obviously attempting to master the</v>
<v Speaker 6>moment to,</v>

2282
01:50:03.750 --> 01:50:07.270
<v Speaker 6>to be a one with the moment and to live</v>
<v Speaker 6>in the moment.</v>

2283
01:50:07.390 --> 01:50:08.890
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's like a big thing that people say</v>

2284
01:50:09.040 --> 01:50:10.960
<v Speaker 6>and what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well that means don't fucking think</v>

2285
01:50:10.961 --> 01:50:13.450
<v Speaker 6>about the past so much.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Don't freak out about this.</v>

2286
01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:16.030
<v Speaker 6>Don't be mad at that guy that fucking</v>
<v Speaker 6>looked at you weird.</v>

2287
01:50:16.031 --> 01:50:18.250
<v Speaker 6>At the red light and carry it with you</v>
<v Speaker 6>all day,</v>

2288
01:50:18.400 --> 01:50:20.250
<v Speaker 6>like be in the moment right now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2289
01:50:20.251 --> 01:50:23.740
<v Speaker 6>So live with the data that's presented</v>
<v Speaker 6>in front of you and stuff instead of</v>

2290
01:50:23.741 --> 01:50:26.790
<v Speaker 6>just dwelling on and droning on about</v>
<v Speaker 6>stress Shit.</v>

2291
01:50:26.950 --> 01:50:29.980
<v Speaker 6>And if you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you'll have more resources to</v>

2292
01:50:29.981 --> 01:50:31.330
<v Speaker 6>concentrate on things you love.</v>

2293
01:50:31.370 --> 01:50:34.220
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the more you do that and the more</v>

2294
01:50:34.221 --> 01:50:36.950
<v Speaker 3>that you are in the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like so like there's like,</v>

2295
01:50:37.050 --> 01:50:38.510
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you and I,</v>

2296
01:50:38.770 --> 01:50:40.460
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we are in the moment,</v>

2297
01:50:40.490 --> 01:50:43.040
<v Speaker 3>but we still think about the past and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the future and what's going on.</v>

2298
01:50:43.041 --> 01:50:45.260
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have two to also because of what we</v>

2299
01:50:45.261 --> 01:50:46.480
<v Speaker 3>do well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wheat.</v>

2300
01:50:46.490 --> 01:50:49.670
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the idea here is that they're people,</v>

2301
01:50:49.671 --> 01:50:51.270
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not just telling you about neem</v>
<v Speaker 3>Karoli Baba,</v>

2302
01:50:51.271 --> 01:50:52.570
<v Speaker 3>but there's a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

2303
01:50:52.580 --> 01:50:54.440
<v Speaker 3>of not a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's not as many as I wish there</v>

2304
01:50:54.441 --> 01:50:56.990
<v Speaker 3>were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there are these people who,</v>

2305
01:50:56.991 --> 01:51:01.130
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have completely,</v>

2306
01:51:01.160 --> 01:51:06.160
<v Speaker 3>or mostly what's you say completely?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of them just given up on the past</v>

2307
01:51:07.851 --> 01:51:09.860
<v Speaker 3>and the future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's gone,</v>

2308
01:51:09.861 --> 01:51:11.450
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just gone.</v>

2309
01:51:11.451 --> 01:51:16.451
<v Speaker 3>Like they gave up on that concept.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So these people are in the,</v>

2310
01:51:17.870 --> 01:51:21.020
<v Speaker 3>they're in the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just living right here and</v>

2311
01:51:21.021 --> 01:51:23.330
<v Speaker 3>that's where they hang out and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't go back.</v>

2312
01:51:23.600 --> 01:51:27.380
<v Speaker 3>And there's a lot of similarities in</v>
<v Speaker 3>their reports of the way that these</v>

2313
01:51:27.381 --> 01:51:28.550
<v Speaker 3>people act.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2314
01:51:28.551 --> 01:51:32.540
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of similarities in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>experiences people claim that they have</v>

2315
01:51:32.810 --> 01:51:35.270
<v Speaker 3>when they're around these people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2316
01:51:35.540 --> 01:51:37.730
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to be really skeptical about it,</v>

2317
01:51:37.731 --> 01:51:38.241
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm,</v>

2318
01:51:38.241 --> 01:51:42.950
<v Speaker 3>I'm just not any more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>only because I know from my contact with</v>

2319
01:51:42.951 --> 01:51:47.390
<v Speaker 3>the Rom doss people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had a shit like a shift.</v>

2320
01:51:47.420 --> 01:51:50.000
<v Speaker 3>Like it shifted me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's something from being around</v>

2321
01:51:50.001 --> 01:51:54.050
<v Speaker 3>those people enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm less angry than I was.</v>

2322
01:51:54.051 --> 01:51:56.480
<v Speaker 3>I'm less freaked out over things than I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was.</v>

2323
01:51:56.481 --> 01:52:01.190
<v Speaker 3>I'm less but more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most importantly I'm a,</v>

2324
01:52:02.360 --> 01:52:06.620
<v Speaker 3>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can recover quicker from getting lost</v>

2325
01:52:06.621 --> 01:52:07.380
<v Speaker 3>in my head.</v>

2326
01:52:07.380 --> 01:52:09.270
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you have a map of the territory now,</v>

2327
01:52:09.480 --> 01:52:10.610
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The,</v>

2328
01:52:10.660 --> 01:52:12.150
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one of the big problems with people,</v>

2329
01:52:12.151 --> 01:52:15.270
<v Speaker 6>the way they react to things is that the</v>
<v Speaker 6>map of the territory they have is based</v>

2330
01:52:15.271 --> 01:52:18.000
<v Speaker 6>on the morons that around them that are</v>
<v Speaker 6>providing with directions.</v>

2331
01:52:18.030 --> 01:52:19.380
<v Speaker 6>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right,</v>

2332
01:52:19.440 --> 01:52:20.670
<v Speaker 6>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The real problem.</v>

2333
01:52:20.700 --> 01:52:23.610
<v Speaker 6>That's why when you're around positive</v>
<v Speaker 6>people and healthy people,</v>

2334
01:52:23.640 --> 01:52:25.080
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it gives you a new map.</v>

2335
01:52:25.560 --> 01:52:29.190
<v Speaker 6>And that's one of the best things that</v>
<v Speaker 6>podcasts do to people that don't have</v>

2336
01:52:29.191 --> 01:52:30.660
<v Speaker 6>any fucking cool friends,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2337
01:52:30.840 --> 01:52:34.410
<v Speaker 6>It provides them with a cool map.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's if you listen to Joey Diaz and</v>

2338
01:52:34.411 --> 01:52:37.680
<v Speaker 6>Lisa it all day,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like you're going to have a silly fun</v>

2339
01:52:37.681 --> 01:52:38.520
<v Speaker 6>map,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2340
01:52:38.550 --> 01:52:42.480
<v Speaker 6>And he'll occasionally drop some fucking</v>
<v Speaker 6>street science on you and some logic.</v>

2341
01:52:42.481 --> 01:52:44.880
<v Speaker 6>It's undeniable and a lot of humor along</v>
<v Speaker 6>the way.</v>

2342
01:52:45.200 --> 01:52:46.970
<v Speaker 6>But like if you listen to Joey Diaz,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the church,</v>

2343
01:52:46.971 --> 01:52:49.630
<v Speaker 6>what's happening now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what you're going to get is you're going</v>

2344
01:52:49.631 --> 01:52:51.360
<v Speaker 6>to get your,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is your friends,</v>

<v Speaker 6>talking to your dog,</v>

2346

<v Speaker 6>when you can to can take people like</v>

2347
01:52:59.181 --> 01:53:00.110
<v Speaker 6>that into your life.</v>

2348
01:53:00.410 --> 01:53:02.330
<v Speaker 6>And they can give you a new map.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's right.</v>

2349
01:53:02.360 --> 01:53:06.680
<v Speaker 6>But if you're stuck and Devil's Dick</v>
<v Speaker 6>Whole Kentucky with a bunch of fucking</v>

2350
01:53:06.681 --> 01:53:10.130
<v Speaker 6>morons that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>or just plowing corn every day and</v>

2351

<v Speaker 6>All right?</v>

2354
01:53:16.400 --> 01:53:21.380
<v Speaker 6>You can find something online where you</v>
<v Speaker 6>can listen and find a fucking Neil</v>

2368
01:53:43.551 --> 01:53:47.270

<v Speaker 6>believe exists outside the solar system.</v>

2369
01:53:47.930 --> 01:53:48.611
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I heard it.</v>

<v Speaker 6>feel you fucker doubters.</v>

2371
01:53:55.480 --> 01:53:58.010
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>obviously that's where 10th planet Jiu</v>

2372
01:53:58.010 --> 01:53:59.550
<v Speaker 6>Jitsu came from.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2373
01:53:59.680 --> 01:54:00.860
<v Speaker 6>Name.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How?</v>

2374
01:54:00.861 --> 01:54:03.050
<v Speaker 6>Validating.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Very validating.</v>

2375
01:54:03.170 --> 01:54:05.720
<v Speaker 6>The reason there's chem trails too.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2376
01:54:05.760 --> 01:54:07.880
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the reason it's 10th planet and not like</v>

2377
01:54:07.881 --> 01:54:11.030
<v Speaker 6>Zechariah sitch are called it the 12th</v>
<v Speaker 6>planet because they were cool.</v>

2378
01:54:11.050 --> 01:54:14.690
<v Speaker 6>They were counting Pluto and he also</v>
<v Speaker 6>counted the moon.</v>

2379
01:54:15.020 --> 01:54:18.710
<v Speaker 6>They counted the moon as a planet,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like our moon as a planet.</v>

2380
01:54:18.920 --> 01:54:21.830
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Apparently the Sumerians had this</v>

2381
01:54:21.860 --> 01:54:26.860
<v Speaker 6>ancient story of how the earth was</v>
<v Speaker 6>created that is almost exactly the same</v>

2382
01:54:27.141 --> 01:54:32.090
<v Speaker 6>as the actual astrological astronomical</v>
<v Speaker 6>rather story like when astro scientist</v>

2383
01:54:32.091 --> 01:54:34.820
<v Speaker 6>and astrophysicist discuss the creation</v>
<v Speaker 6>of the earth,</v>

2384
01:54:34.890 --> 01:54:37.130
<v Speaker 6>if you believe there's earth one and an</v>
<v Speaker 6>earth too.</v>

2385
01:54:37.370 --> 01:54:41.540
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And Earth one was hit by another planet</v>

2386
01:54:41.870 --> 01:54:43.820
<v Speaker 6>that came around,</v>
<v Speaker 6>collided with us,</v>

2387
01:54:43.821 --> 01:54:45.470
<v Speaker 6>created the moon,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and created the earth.</v>

2388
01:54:45.500 --> 01:54:47.240
<v Speaker 6>Like the shape that we currently see</v>
<v Speaker 6>right now.</v>

2389
01:54:47.270 --> 01:54:49.430
<v Speaker 6>Right now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is some shit that they had in the</v>

2390
01:54:49.431 --> 01:54:53.060
<v Speaker 6>Sumerian text.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They had two different plants called Mar</v>

2391
01:54:53.060 --> 01:54:55.970
<v Speaker 6>Duke and Tmr.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that these f hoping that I've got</v>

2392
01:54:55.971 --> 01:54:58.760
<v Speaker 6>the names right,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they collided with each other and that,</v>

2393
01:54:58.761 --> 01:55:01.280
<v Speaker 6>that formed earth.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that formed our mood.</v>

2394
01:55:01.281 --> 01:55:05.810
<v Speaker 6>Like they wrote about this clay tablets</v>
<v Speaker 6>with little squiggly lines.</v>

2395
01:55:05.840 --> 01:55:07.880
<v Speaker 6>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like old school nails.</v>

2396
01:55:08.030 --> 01:55:09.680
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>left right up,</v>

2397
01:55:09.681 --> 01:55:11.090
<v Speaker 6>down.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That was their language.</v>

2398
01:55:11.091 --> 01:55:14.720
<v Speaker 6>And they wrote about this co,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and this isn't just like some wacky</v>

2399
01:55:14.721 --> 01:55:17.090
<v Speaker 6>Zechariah sitch and shit cause that</v>
<v Speaker 6>Christ's Hitchen had,</v>

2400
01:55:17.600 --> 01:55:20.340
<v Speaker 6>he was the guy that wrote uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the 12th planet and he,</v>

2401
01:55:20.341 --> 01:55:23.450
<v Speaker 6>he,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he wrote all this crazy stuff about the</v>

2402
01:55:23.451 --> 01:55:26.600
<v Speaker 6>Annunaki.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Those from heaven to Earth came these</v>

2403
01:55:26.601 --> 01:55:30.740
<v Speaker 6>aliens that engineered human beings to</v>
<v Speaker 6>mine for gold.</v>

2404
01:55:30.870 --> 01:55:32.090
<v Speaker 6>Do you know the whole story behind it?</v>

2405
01:55:32.090 --> 01:55:33.230
<v Speaker 6>I only,</v>
<v Speaker 6>from what I've heard,</v>

2406
01:55:33.231 --> 01:55:34.220
<v Speaker 6>you talk,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh my God,</v>

2407
01:55:34.221 --> 01:55:38.300
<v Speaker 6>it was hilariously crazy but fascinating</v>
<v Speaker 6>stuff.</v>

2408
01:55:38.301 --> 01:55:41.720
<v Speaker 6>Cause this guy's Zechariah Sitchin was</v>
<v Speaker 6>not before,</v>

2409
01:55:41.721 --> 01:55:44.310
<v Speaker 6>this wasn't quacky all.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's like,</v>

2410
01:55:44.311 --> 01:55:48.660
<v Speaker 6>he's a legit like scholar.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's a legit biblical scholar and he's a</v>

2411
01:55:48.690 --> 01:55:52.950
<v Speaker 6>legit linguist and going over all of</v>
<v Speaker 6>this ancient shit.</v>

2412
01:55:53.220 --> 01:55:58.220
<v Speaker 6>He came up with these crazy theories</v>
<v Speaker 6>about human beings being engineered by</v>

2413
01:55:58.891 --> 01:56:03.570
<v Speaker 6>these aliens that existed thousands and</v>
<v Speaker 6>thousands of years ago.</v>

2414
01:56:03.600 --> 01:56:06.450
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And they come around in this orbit and</v>

2415
01:56:06.460 --> 01:56:11.460
<v Speaker 6>elliptical orbit that every 3,600 years</v>
<v Speaker 6>comes between Mars and Jupiter and it</v>

2416
01:56:12.061 --> 01:56:14.820
<v Speaker 6>wreck Ha.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It wreaks havoc on the earth's</v>

2417
01:56:14.821 --> 01:56:19.260
<v Speaker 6>gravitational pull and the oceans and</v>
<v Speaker 6>storms and shit because you got this</v>

2418
01:56:19.261 --> 01:56:21.840
<v Speaker 6>giant ass planet,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but all of sudden makes its way into our</v>

2419
01:56:21.841 --> 01:56:22.790
<v Speaker 6>solar system.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

2420
01:56:22.800 --> 01:56:26.190
<v Speaker 6>And that at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's when they fucking scoot off and</v>

2421
01:56:26.191 --> 01:56:27.870
<v Speaker 6>jet over to check us out again.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

2422
01:56:28.020 --> 01:56:29.730
<v Speaker 6>what are you crazy monkeys up to?</v>

2423
01:56:29.760 --> 01:56:32.040
<v Speaker 6>What have you been doing?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Where's my fucking gold bitch?</v>

2424
01:56:32.280 --> 01:56:35.390
<v Speaker 6>And then they fuck a bunch of monkeys</v>
<v Speaker 6>and they make some new people and then I</v>

2425
01:56:35.400 --> 01:56:35.820
<v Speaker 6>go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>nay,</v>

2426
01:56:35.820 --> 01:56:36.680
<v Speaker 6>jet,</v>
<v Speaker 6>see Ya.</v>

2427
01:56:37.010 --> 01:56:38.850
<v Speaker 6>I take off.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And they leave behind these stories.</v>

2428
01:56:38.851 --> 01:56:41.790
<v Speaker 6>These monkeys are writing it down and</v>
<v Speaker 6>clay and trying to remember why they</v>

2429
01:56:41.791 --> 01:56:44.850
<v Speaker 6>like gold,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they need gold because they suspend</v>

2430
01:56:44.851 --> 01:56:48.450
<v Speaker 6>gold particles in the atmosphere to</v>
<v Speaker 6>protect them from the elements.</v>

2431
01:56:48.760 --> 01:56:53.220
<v Speaker 6>The idea is that gold,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if gold is incredibly unique and that</v>

2432
01:56:53.221 --> 01:56:56.460
<v Speaker 6>you can take a tiny piece of gold and we</v>
<v Speaker 6>can coat this entire table.</v>

2433
01:56:56.760 --> 01:57:00.750
<v Speaker 6>That's why gold coding like gold plating</v>
<v Speaker 6>is so amazing.</v>

2434
01:57:00.751 --> 01:57:02.970
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because through a small amount of gold</v>

2435
01:57:02.971 --> 01:57:05.790
<v Speaker 6>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can stretch it out insanely thin.</v>

2436
01:57:06.300 --> 01:57:07.620
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>gold particles,</v>

2437
01:57:07.621 --> 01:57:10.380
<v Speaker 6>gold dust.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The idea is that they would suspend</v>

2438
01:57:10.381 --> 01:57:13.350
<v Speaker 6>these gold particles in their atmosphere</v>
<v Speaker 6>and it would protect them from the</v>

2439
01:57:13.351 --> 01:57:14.460
<v Speaker 6>radiation of the sun.</v>

2440
01:57:14.850 --> 01:57:17.430
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that sound crazy until there's like</v>

2441
01:57:17.431 --> 01:57:18.270
<v Speaker 6>this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there was a,</v>

2442
01:57:18.271 --> 01:57:22.230
<v Speaker 6>this symposium on environmental</v>
<v Speaker 6>symposium that these,</v>

2443
01:57:22.231 --> 01:57:26.430
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>scientists did in like the 1970s or no,</v>

2444
01:57:26.431 --> 01:57:28.020
<v Speaker 6>it was in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I believe it was actually in the two</v>

2445
01:57:28.021 --> 01:57:30.060
<v Speaker 6>thousands now I'm thinking about this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it was,</v>

2446
01:57:30.090 --> 01:57:30.721
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>10,</v>

2447
01:57:30.721 --> 01:57:34.220
<v Speaker 6>15 years ago where they were trying to</v>
<v Speaker 6>come up with ways is back when member,</v>

2448
01:57:34.221 --> 01:57:36.600
<v Speaker 6>whenever he was really worried about the</v>
<v Speaker 6>ozone layer and the hairspray was</v>

2449
01:57:36.601 --> 01:57:38.880
<v Speaker 6>heating up the ozone layer.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They were trying to figure out</v>

2450
01:57:38.881 --> 01:57:41.850
<v Speaker 6>alternative to protect us from the</v>
<v Speaker 6>radiation of the sun.</v>

2451
01:57:41.851 --> 01:57:46.230
<v Speaker 6>And one of them was suspending</v>
<v Speaker 6>reflective particles in the atmosphere</v>

2452
01:57:46.310 --> 01:57:49.350
<v Speaker 6>sitch and wrote about this decades</v>
<v Speaker 6>before,</v>

2453
01:57:49.351 --> 01:57:52.020
<v Speaker 6>this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>decades before that attributing this</v>

2454
01:57:52.021 --> 01:57:56.280
<v Speaker 6>process of suspending gold in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I'm not saying that he's right,</v>

2455
01:57:56.310 --> 01:57:58.960
<v Speaker 6>but God damn,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's fun to call a store.</v>

2456
01:57:58.961 --> 01:58:00.990
<v Speaker 6>So sexy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The fact that we are,</v>

2457
01:58:01.170 --> 01:58:02.790
<v Speaker 6>that's why we're different from all the</v>
<v Speaker 6>other monkeys.</v>

2458
01:58:02.910 --> 01:58:06.000
<v Speaker 6>How much different are we were soft.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We don't remember how we got soft.</v>

2459
01:58:06.280 --> 01:58:08.190
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we have language like pretty much from</v>

2460
01:58:08.191 --> 01:58:10.410
<v Speaker 6>the job.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We've had language for a long ass time</v>

2461
01:58:10.910 --> 01:58:14.670
<v Speaker 6>writing shit down on cave walls.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We had awesome artwork 40,000 years ago.</v>

2462
01:58:14.860 --> 01:58:16.110
<v Speaker 6>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What happened?</v>

2463
01:58:16.400 --> 01:58:19.590
<v Speaker 6>Where did we come from?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Everything else is covered in hair and</v>

2464
01:58:19.591 --> 01:58:22.830
<v Speaker 6>bite in the shit out of each other and</v>
<v Speaker 6>all of a sudden this thing in the blink</v>

2465
01:58:22.831 --> 01:58:25.860
<v Speaker 6>of an eye and no one can,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no one can guess why.</v>

2466
01:58:25.870 --> 01:58:27.540
<v Speaker 6>W W what?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What caused it?</v>

2467
01:58:27.750 --> 01:58:30.060
<v Speaker 6>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 6>How did this thing go from doubling its</v>

2468
01:58:30.061 --> 01:58:32.880
<v Speaker 6>brain in a million years or 10 million</v>
<v Speaker 6>years or whatever the fuck it wasn't a</v>

2469
01:58:32.881 --> 01:58:35.830
<v Speaker 6>short period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How did this thing become this thing and</v>

2470
01:58:35.850 --> 01:58:38.430
<v Speaker 6>why this persistent looked to the</v>
<v Speaker 6>heavens for answers.</v>

2471
01:58:38.730 --> 01:58:40.530
<v Speaker 6>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why Has God in the heavens?</v>

2472
01:58:40.560 --> 01:58:41.890
<v Speaker 6>Why can't God be inside of us?</v>

2473
01:58:42.160 --> 01:58:43.660
<v Speaker 4>Why can't God be in the middle of this</v>
<v Speaker 4>earth?</v>

2474
01:58:43.780 --> 01:58:45.100
<v Speaker 4>Why is he in the heavens?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

2475
01:58:45.500 --> 01:58:48.550
<v Speaker 4>Because the fucking come from.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's where the angels are coming from,</v>

2476
01:58:48.551 --> 01:58:49.241
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Come on.</v>

2477
01:58:49.241 --> 01:58:51.400
<v Speaker 4>I got to spell it out for you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Little tiny people that fly.</v>

2478
01:58:52.090 --> 01:58:53.560
<v Speaker 4>They're fucking aliens,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2479
01:58:53.590 --> 01:58:55.900
<v Speaker 4>They're coming down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The grabbing the monkeys,</v>

2480
01:58:56.110 --> 01:58:58.600
<v Speaker 4>they're going to Tj's numb.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They had to take them up.</v>

2481
01:58:58.860 --> 01:59:00.430
<v Speaker 4>In the end,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're going to take him up there and</v>

2482
01:59:00.490 --> 01:59:01.770
<v Speaker 4>do some experiments.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ah,</v>

2483
01:59:01.810 --> 01:59:05.110
<v Speaker 4>how confusing be so awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If it was so true to be fucked by an</v>

2484
01:59:05.111 --> 01:59:06.130
<v Speaker 4>alien,</v>
<v Speaker 4>be the best,</v>

2485
01:59:06.131 --> 01:59:08.710
<v Speaker 4>probably the best.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He'd probably be really bummed out with</v>

2486
01:59:08.711 --> 01:59:09.970
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You only have one dick.</v>

2487
01:59:09.971 --> 01:59:12.170
<v Speaker 4>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>aliens have like 30 dicks.</v>

2488
01:59:12.200 --> 01:59:14.100
<v Speaker 4>We put them everywhere in your body like</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even like dicks.</v>

2489
01:59:15.150 --> 01:59:18.310
<v Speaker 4>They're dicks or like ecstasy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tasers.</v>

2490
01:59:18.580 --> 01:59:20.380
<v Speaker 4>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>great.</v>

2491
01:59:20.381 --> 01:59:22.570
<v Speaker 4>Imagine their Dick was like an ecstasy</v>
<v Speaker 4>taser.</v>

2492
01:59:22.600 --> 01:59:25.390
<v Speaker 4>If like the female opposite of a Taser.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody has dicks.</v>

2493
01:59:25.630 --> 01:59:27.280
<v Speaker 4>They open up their jacket.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like those dudes,</v>

2494
01:59:27.281 --> 01:59:29.930
<v Speaker 4>it would sell watches and they reveal a</v>
<v Speaker 4>thousand dicks.</v>

2495
01:59:29.950 --> 01:59:31.780
<v Speaker 4>Just swing out and grab a hold.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You in.</v>

2496
01:59:32.230 --> 01:59:35.110
<v Speaker 4>Ecstasy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tastes fresh eggs and not dick's.</v>

2497
01:59:35.120 --> 01:59:37.600
<v Speaker 4>They're like a technical type thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what they say.</v>

2498
01:59:37.601 --> 01:59:39.470
<v Speaker 4>But I keep feeling that comes inside</v>
<v Speaker 4>yet,</v>

2499
01:59:40.690 --> 01:59:42.820
<v Speaker 4>but they're come is ecstasy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't worry.</v>

2500
01:59:42.821 --> 01:59:43.930
<v Speaker 4>Human.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is not a date.</v>

2501
01:59:45.340 --> 01:59:47.080
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It looks like a Dick and tastes like a</v>

2502
01:59:47.081 --> 01:59:48.970
<v Speaker 4>dick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2503
01:59:48.971 --> 01:59:51.520
<v Speaker 4>that seems like a really inefficient way</v>
<v Speaker 4>to harvest gold though,</v>

2504
01:59:51.521 --> 01:59:52.061
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like it.</v>

2505
01:59:52.061 --> 01:59:52.841
<v Speaker 4>These are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2506
01:59:52.841 --> 01:59:56.830
<v Speaker 4>the problem with those theories is like</v>
<v Speaker 4>here you've got these advance super</v>

2507
01:59:56.831 --> 02:00:00.430
<v Speaker 4>advanced beings.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They lay live on a planet that orbits,</v>

2508
02:00:00.730 --> 02:00:02.890
<v Speaker 4>they figured out a way to like disperse</v>
<v Speaker 4>golden,</v>

2509
02:00:02.891 --> 02:00:05.560
<v Speaker 4>their atmosphere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've figured out a way to like evolve</v>

2510
02:00:05.561 --> 02:00:08.830
<v Speaker 4>monkeys into gold miners,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's like,</v>

2511
02:00:08.831 --> 02:00:10.090
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's gotta be a bet.</v>

2512
02:00:10.300 --> 02:00:13.870
<v Speaker 4>It's gotta be a better way to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A more efficient way than like flying on</v>

2513
02:00:13.871 --> 02:00:17.470
<v Speaker 4>your planet to another planet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fucking the monkeys turning them into</v>

2514
02:00:17.471 --> 02:00:19.120
<v Speaker 4>gold gathers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

2515
02:00:19.121 --> 02:00:22.090
<v Speaker 4>Why is that the only way?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it seems like it's not the only</v>

2516
02:00:22.091 --> 02:00:22.821
<v Speaker 4>way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but maybe it's,</v>

2517
02:00:22.821 --> 02:00:24.970
<v Speaker 4>it's the funnest way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's a good way like,</v>

2518
02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:28.240
<v Speaker 4>but what do they give a fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're probably so far advanced from us</v>

2519
02:00:28.241 --> 02:00:30.670
<v Speaker 4>that it's a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's hilarious to go down there and do.</v>

2520
02:00:30.671 --> 02:00:31.570
<v Speaker 4>That's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2521
02:00:31.640 --> 02:00:34.600
<v Speaker 4>Seaworld,</v>
<v Speaker 4>seaworld with people or it's just a kid</v>

2522
02:00:34.601 --> 02:00:36.280
<v Speaker 4>does it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's just like a group of kids for</v>

2523
02:00:36.281 --> 02:00:37.360
<v Speaker 4>their science.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2524
02:00:37.370 --> 02:00:38.590
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's just no telling.</v>

2525
02:00:38.591 --> 02:00:39.400
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But well,</v>

2526
02:00:39.400 --> 02:00:41.230
<v Speaker 4>who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 4>By the time they come back around,</v>

2527
02:00:41.231 --> 02:00:45.730
<v Speaker 4>they might be over it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They might be so evolved after the 3,600</v>

2528
02:00:45.731 --> 02:00:48.250
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If evolution is exponential,</v>

2529
02:00:48.550 --> 02:00:50.110
<v Speaker 4>they might come back and not even talk</v>
<v Speaker 4>to us.</v>

2530
02:00:50.740 --> 02:00:53.430
<v Speaker 4>Then people be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are they just decided to not come back?</v>

2531
02:00:53.440 --> 02:00:55.570
<v Speaker 4>Just fly by and go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>president trump,</v>

2532
02:00:56.050 --> 02:00:57.280
<v Speaker 4>trump.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's going to be like,</v>

2533
02:00:57.281 --> 02:00:59.290
<v Speaker 4>they're going to sky ride it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>President trump,</v>

2534
02:01:00.370 --> 02:01:02.040
<v Speaker 4>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I'm talking to you and they're just</v>

2535
02:01:02.050 --> 02:01:03.080
<v Speaker 4>gonna fly by like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wait,</v>

2536
02:01:04.930 --> 02:01:06.580
<v Speaker 4>we can't really get to them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2537
02:01:06.581 --> 02:01:08.320
<v Speaker 4>because it takes too long.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2538
02:01:08.370 --> 02:01:09.760
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it's like Mars,</v>

2539
02:01:09.761 --> 02:01:11.030
<v Speaker 4>like they're talking about getting to</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mars know,</v>

2540
02:01:11.040 --> 02:01:13.810
<v Speaker 4>like a few decades.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll believe it when I see it.</v>

2541
02:01:13.860 --> 02:01:15.430
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe when I see it right now,</v>

2542
02:01:15.431 --> 02:01:17.500
<v Speaker 4>you can't get to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if that fucking planet comes</v>

2543
02:01:17.590 --> 02:01:21.100
<v Speaker 4>searching some scorching around the</v>
<v Speaker 4>corner between Mars and Jupiter,</v>

2544
02:01:21.250 --> 02:01:21.791
<v Speaker 4>we're going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

2545
02:01:21.791 --> 02:01:25.060
<v Speaker 4>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 4>come back.</v>

2546
02:01:25.270 --> 02:01:28.030
<v Speaker 4>What's the prediction of when it's going</v>
<v Speaker 4>to get here?</v>

2547
02:01:28.060 --> 02:01:29.890
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't know if it's ever going to</v>

2548
02:01:29.891 --> 02:01:31.780
<v Speaker 4>get here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This what they found,</v>

2549
02:01:31.840 --> 02:01:33.760
<v Speaker 4>they don't know the orbit of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't do anything.</v>

2550
02:01:33.761 --> 02:01:34.660
<v Speaker 4>But there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>

2551
02:01:34.690 --> 02:01:37.000
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's all connected to the reason why</v>

2552
02:01:37.001 --> 02:01:39.980
<v Speaker 4>Pluto was taken off of the planet list.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They</v>

2553
02:01:39.980 --> 02:01:43.250
<v Speaker 2>realized that Pluto is just a body in</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's called the Kuyper belt.</v>

2554
02:01:43.280 --> 02:01:47.150
<v Speaker 2>The kuiper belt is just on the edge of</v>
<v Speaker 2>our solar system and there's a drop off</v>

2555
02:01:47.180 --> 02:01:49.580
<v Speaker 2>at the end of it that they called the</v>
<v Speaker 2>galactic shelf.</v>

2556
02:01:49.730 --> 02:01:53.050
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that has been indicating to some,</v>

2557
02:01:53.060 --> 02:01:56.210
<v Speaker 2>some scientists who are willing to</v>
<v Speaker 2>venture and willing to explore the idea</v>

2558
02:01:56.420 --> 02:02:01.220
<v Speaker 2>that there's a large,</v>
<v Speaker 2>massive body outside of that that's</v>

2559
02:02:01.221 --> 02:02:04.580
<v Speaker 2>causing this dropoff that's caused</v>
<v Speaker 2>causing this galactic shelf.</v>

2560
02:02:04.790 --> 02:02:07.670
<v Speaker 2>So as their understanding of our solar</v>
<v Speaker 2>system gets better,</v>

2561
02:02:08.330 --> 02:02:13.310
<v Speaker 2>noticeably like wider,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like as as they can look further back</v>

2562
02:02:13.311 --> 02:02:16.550
<v Speaker 2>and further distances,</v>
<v Speaker 2>telescopes keep getting better and their</v>

2563
02:02:16.551 --> 02:02:20.990
<v Speaker 2>calculations and the way they can figure</v>
<v Speaker 2>out how the spot planets in other solar</v>

2564
02:02:20.991 --> 02:02:22.400
<v Speaker 2>systems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're way better at it now than</v>

2565
02:02:22.401 --> 02:02:26.330
<v Speaker 2>they've ever been before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's when they're pretty sure they're</v>

2566
02:02:26.331 --> 02:02:28.460
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're pretty sure there's another planet</v>

2567
02:02:28.461 --> 02:02:29.750
<v Speaker 2>out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it could,</v>

2568
02:02:29.810 --> 02:02:31.100
<v Speaker 2>there's also some speculation.</v>

2569
02:02:31.100 --> 02:02:33.020
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a few decades ago that it</v>

2570
02:02:33.021 --> 02:02:35.980
<v Speaker 2>could be a brown dwarf star,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2571
02:02:36.020 --> 02:02:40.790
<v Speaker 2>We could have a bio nary a solar system</v>
<v Speaker 2>that in fact many source systems are</v>

2572
02:02:40.791 --> 02:02:43.910
<v Speaker 2>binary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meaning there's more than one planet.</v>

2573
02:02:43.940 --> 02:02:44.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

2574
02:02:44.901 --> 02:02:48.710
<v Speaker 2>there's a single one and then there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the one that we have that's on</v>

2575
02:02:48.711 --> 02:02:51.770
<v Speaker 2>right now and there's one that burned</v>
<v Speaker 2>out already and that burned out.</v>

2576
02:02:51.771 --> 02:02:53.990
<v Speaker 2>One is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is way the fuck out there where it</v>

2577
02:02:53.991 --> 02:02:58.991
<v Speaker 2>doesn't emit any light anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is this massive object outside</v>

2578
02:02:59.211 --> 02:03:01.910
<v Speaker 2>of Pluto.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was one theory that they had,</v>

2579
02:03:01.911 --> 02:03:05.000
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think they go with that one</v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore because as far as I'm,</v>

2580
02:03:05.060 --> 02:03:08.420
<v Speaker 2>I know they've narrowed down the size of</v>
<v Speaker 2>this thing,</v>

2581
02:03:08.750 --> 02:03:11.510
<v Speaker 2>at least with the current data to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>about four times the size of the earth.</v>

2582
02:03:12.110 --> 02:03:15.380
<v Speaker 2>So there's something four times the size</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the earth and just still tiny in</v>

2583
02:03:15.381 --> 02:03:17.930
<v Speaker 2>comparison to the son and he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and tiny,</v>

2584
02:03:17.931 --> 02:03:21.020
<v Speaker 2>even comparison to Jupiter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sun is a million times bigger than</v>

2585
02:03:21.021 --> 02:03:21.470
<v Speaker 2>the earth.</v>

2586
02:03:21.470 --> 02:03:23.540
<v Speaker 2>So if this thing is four times larger</v>
<v Speaker 2>than the earth,</v>

2587
02:03:23.541 --> 02:03:26.730
<v Speaker 2>well I don't know what that means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's a planet or if it's a,</v>

2588
02:03:27.080 --> 02:03:28.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a giant object.</v>

2589
02:03:28.911 --> 02:03:31.260
<v Speaker 2>Like what exactly is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did it used to be a son?</v>

2590
02:03:31.700 --> 02:03:33.180
<v Speaker 2>Is that possible?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that's probably,</v>

2591
02:03:33.200 --> 02:03:36.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Find out how big it's supposed to be.</v>

2592
02:03:37.060 --> 02:03:40.070
<v Speaker 2>Cause I'm pretty sure I'm right that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're thinking now with their current</v>

2593
02:03:40.071 --> 02:03:43.670
<v Speaker 2>data that it might be four times as big</v>
<v Speaker 2>as the earth,</v>

2594
02:03:43.970 --> 02:03:47.900
<v Speaker 2>which is still pretty fucking trippy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That there's some rock spinning around</v>

2595
02:03:47.901 --> 02:03:49.890
<v Speaker 2>out there that's a planet bigger than</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2596
02:03:49.910 --> 02:03:53.030
<v Speaker 2>It isn't like cupid are way bigger than</v>
<v Speaker 2>cooper does on a real planet though.</v>

2597
02:03:53.060 --> 02:03:55.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean it is a plas to gas chain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2598
02:03:55.580 --> 02:03:57.350
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a center somewhere in</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

2599
02:03:57.370 --> 02:03:58.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a tootsie roll pop.</v>

2600
02:03:59.030 --> 02:04:00.680
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how many licks it takes to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get there though.</v>

2601
02:04:01.070 --> 02:04:03.980
<v Speaker 2>It's a very big town.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so big.</v>

2602
02:04:04.250 --> 02:04:06.380
<v Speaker 2>They have storms on Jupiter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're bigger than earth.</v>

2603
02:04:06.650 --> 02:04:08.150
<v Speaker 2>They've been going on for a thousand</v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

2604
02:04:08.300 --> 02:04:09.140
<v Speaker 2>Did you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2605
02:04:09.470 --> 02:04:12.590
<v Speaker 2>did you follow this thing with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>detection of the gravity waves?</v>

2606
02:04:12.591 --> 02:04:14.180
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty crazy.</v>

2607
02:04:14.460 --> 02:04:15.980
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm too stupid.</v>

2608
02:04:16.010 --> 02:04:17.630
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I can explain it.</v>

2609
02:04:17.780 --> 02:04:18.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm to try.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2610
02:04:18.891 --> 02:04:19.970
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

2611
02:04:20.120 --> 02:04:22.010
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the idea is right,</v>

2612
02:04:22.040 --> 02:04:25.640
<v Speaker 2>we know that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fucking lead ball on the mattress</v>

2613
02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.790
<v Speaker 2>creates these d indentations in space</v>
<v Speaker 2>and time,</v>

2614
02:04:28.791 --> 02:04:29.360
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2615
02:04:29.360 --> 02:04:33.050
<v Speaker 2>So the idea is if that's the case in</v>
<v Speaker 2>timespace as they say,</v>

2616
02:04:33.051 --> 02:04:35.480
<v Speaker 2>so that if that's the case and you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll probably fuck it up.</v>

2617
02:04:35.481 --> 02:04:37.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to track.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that's the case,</v>

2618
02:04:37.500 --> 02:04:37.980
<v Speaker 2>then what would</v>

2619
02:04:37.980 --> 02:04:42.390
<v Speaker 3>happen if two super massive things</v>
<v Speaker 3>collided,</v>

2620
02:04:42.450 --> 02:04:45.280
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like two giant black holes,</v>

2621
02:04:45.450 --> 02:04:50.110
<v Speaker 3>thousands of times larger than our sun</v>
<v Speaker 3>or two stars or what?</v>

2622
02:04:50.130 --> 02:04:52.500
<v Speaker 3>What happens out there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If these giant things collide,</v>

2623
02:04:52.890 --> 02:04:55.860
<v Speaker 3>then that should create ripples because</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so,</v>

2624
02:04:55.920 --> 02:04:57.840
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>normous that when they hit together,</v>

2625
02:04:58.080 --> 02:05:01.590
<v Speaker 3>it creates these ripples in the fabric</v>
<v Speaker 3>of space time.</v>

2626
02:05:01.800 --> 02:05:03.720
<v Speaker 3>And these are known as gravity waves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2627
02:05:03.721 --> 02:05:08.130
<v Speaker 3>So to measure these ripples would be</v>
<v Speaker 3>incredibly difficult for a lot of</v>

2628
02:05:08.131 --> 02:05:09.150
<v Speaker 3>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One,</v>

2629
02:05:09.151 --> 02:05:14.151
<v Speaker 3>because I they're very fast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other one is because if I'm like,</v>

2630
02:05:14.371 --> 02:05:15.840
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so if I want to measure like the</v>

2631
02:05:15.841 --> 02:05:20.730
<v Speaker 3>distance between two rocks and a gravity</v>
<v Speaker 3>wave flows through it,</v>

2632
02:05:20.731 --> 02:05:23.480
<v Speaker 3>then it should theoretically since it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>a oh it should couldn't,</v>

2633
02:05:23.790 --> 02:05:28.740
<v Speaker 3>it should expand and like widen out the</v>
<v Speaker 3>distance between those two rocks.</v>

2634
02:05:28.741 --> 02:05:32.910
<v Speaker 3>There's going to be like a expansion is</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing rolls through it it by micron</v>

2635
02:05:32.911 --> 02:05:33.930
<v Speaker 3>by a tiny little bit.</v>

2636
02:05:34.140 --> 02:05:36.600
<v Speaker 3>It's going to either widen or linkedin</v>
<v Speaker 3>or both.</v>

2637
02:05:36.601 --> 02:05:38.880
<v Speaker 3>I think both.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for a second.</v>

2638
02:05:39.090 --> 02:05:43.620
<v Speaker 3>So how do I measure that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If when the gravity wave passes through,</v>

2639
02:05:43.621 --> 02:05:47.040
<v Speaker 3>it's also going to make my measurement</v>
<v Speaker 3>device expand and contract and it's also</v>

2640
02:05:47.041 --> 02:05:49.760
<v Speaker 3>going to make me country expanding</v>
<v Speaker 3>contracts.</v>

2641
02:05:49.800 --> 02:05:53.880
<v Speaker 3>There was no way to measure it because</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything will move with it.</v>

2642
02:05:53.881 --> 02:05:56.880
<v Speaker 3>So how do you measure it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they have this thing called an infor</v>

2643
02:05:56.940 --> 02:06:00.060
<v Speaker 3>in fear or Ramadan or or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And for amateur,</v>

2644
02:06:00.240 --> 02:06:05.070
<v Speaker 3>you can look it up as this giant l shape</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing that shoots a laser that hits a</v>

2645
02:06:05.071 --> 02:06:09.240
<v Speaker 3>mirror on one side and shoots a laser</v>
<v Speaker 3>that hits a mirror on the other side</v>

2646
02:06:09.420 --> 02:06:12.120
<v Speaker 3>creating this beam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's the speed of light,</v>

2647
02:06:12.121 --> 02:06:14.340
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the laser bouncing back and forth</v>

2648
02:06:14.341 --> 02:06:18.480
<v Speaker 3>at the speed of light.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that means that it could measure a</v>

2649
02:06:18.481 --> 02:06:22.500
<v Speaker 3>shift in the gravitational wave because</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing goes faster than the speed of</v>

2650
02:06:22.501 --> 02:06:24.030
<v Speaker 3>light,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which means that that laser,</v>

2651
02:06:24.270 --> 02:06:29.130
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be able to tell if it</v>
<v Speaker 3>follows the prediction of what would</v>

2652
02:06:29.131 --> 02:06:31.890
<v Speaker 3>happen if a gravity wave rolled through,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2653
02:06:32.160 --> 02:06:34.080
<v Speaker 3>There's two of these things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2654
02:06:34.081 --> 02:06:37.920
<v Speaker 3>and there are hundreds of miles apart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if a gravity wave rolls through the</v>

2655
02:06:37.921 --> 02:06:40.050
<v Speaker 3>earth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>than both of them would theoretically</v>

2656
02:06:40.051 --> 02:06:43.620
<v Speaker 3>have these exact same minor shifts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2657
02:06:43.830 --> 02:06:44.940
<v Speaker 3>And so that's what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2658
02:06:44.941 --> 02:06:46.920
<v Speaker 3>They like now when they're doing these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2659
02:06:47.160 --> 02:06:49.230
<v Speaker 3>when they're doing these studies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2660
02:06:49.231 --> 02:06:50.970
<v Speaker 3>when they're testing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they act,</v>

2661
02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:54.570
<v Speaker 3>they will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they send in fake gravity waves just to</v>

2662
02:06:54.571 --> 02:06:56.580
<v Speaker 3>make sure the scientists are monitoring</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything,</v>

2663
02:06:56.690 --> 02:06:58.440
<v Speaker 3>writing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

2664
02:06:58.830 --> 02:07:01.170
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guy who observed it for the first</v>

2665
02:07:01.171 --> 02:07:03.390
<v Speaker 3>time got this reading and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit,</v>

2666
02:07:04.580 --> 02:07:06.990
<v Speaker 3>is this one of the fake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2667
02:07:07.080 --> 02:07:09.210
<v Speaker 3>one of the fake waves that they send</v>
<v Speaker 3>through,</v>

2668
02:07:09.211 --> 02:07:14.211
<v Speaker 3>but that he realized that they had cut</v>
<v Speaker 3>off that part of the experiment for a</v>

2669
02:07:15.990 --> 02:07:17.490
<v Speaker 3>few weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he knew they weren't doing that.</v>

2670
02:07:17.620 --> 02:07:18.660
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm lost you there.</v>

2671
02:07:19.140 --> 02:07:20.220
<v Speaker 3>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the point is,</v>

2672
02:07:20.221 --> 02:07:23.550
<v Speaker 3>it was like the story of them like</v>
<v Speaker 3>discovering this is,</v>

2673
02:07:23.940 --> 02:07:27.960
<v Speaker 3>is a amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because finally this like shift</v>

2674
02:07:27.961 --> 02:07:29.370
<v Speaker 3>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the,</v>

2675
02:07:29.540 --> 02:07:31.800
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the long and short of it is look at what</v>

2676
02:07:31.801 --> 02:07:33.960
<v Speaker 3>it picked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like show what it was picking up.</v>

2677
02:07:33.961 --> 02:07:35.100
<v Speaker 3>It picked up these two</v>

2678
02:07:36.010 --> 02:07:40.990
<v Speaker 6>smashing into each other along far,</v>
<v Speaker 6>far away,</v>

2679
02:07:40.991 --> 02:07:43.430
<v Speaker 6>like a billion years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Picked it.</v>

2680
02:07:43.990 --> 02:07:46.340
<v Speaker 6>I know that it's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Look,</v>

2681
02:07:46.900 --> 02:07:48.340
<v Speaker 6>look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's fucking,</v>

2682
02:07:48.341 --> 02:07:49.960
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's obviously not the real picture,</v>

2683
02:07:49.961 --> 02:07:51.140
<v Speaker 6>but,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2684
02:07:51.700 --> 02:07:54.730
<v Speaker 6>I just something insane to think that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2685
02:07:54.820 --> 02:07:55.750
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what's fucked up?</v>

2686
02:07:55.810 --> 02:07:59.440
<v Speaker 6>That is not the real picture.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But now the real pictures that they do</v>

2687
02:07:59.441 --> 02:08:02.650
<v Speaker 6>have of what's going on in the galaxy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You ever see a picture of a stellar</v>

2688
02:08:02.651 --> 02:08:05.560
<v Speaker 6>nursery now?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean I've seen the Hubble picks,</v>

2689
02:08:05.561 --> 02:08:07.900
<v Speaker 6>if that's what you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know what a stellar nursery.</v>

2690
02:08:07.901 --> 02:08:09.580
<v Speaker 6>I was like where stars are born.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

2691
02:08:09.581 --> 02:08:12.460
<v Speaker 6>you mean like with this huge,</v>
<v Speaker 6>show me a picture.</v>

2692
02:08:12.461 --> 02:08:15.190
<v Speaker 6>I bet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've seen there's the structures that</v>

2693
02:08:15.191 --> 02:08:16.750
<v Speaker 6>appear.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A lot of the pictures that you see,</v>

2694
02:08:16.751 --> 02:08:19.030
<v Speaker 6>the or artist's recreation,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a lot of them,</v>

2695
02:08:19.510 --> 02:08:22.060
<v Speaker 6>cause there's a lot of weird shit that</v>
<v Speaker 6>you see on the Internet.</v>

2696
02:08:22.061 --> 02:08:23.080
<v Speaker 6>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is that wait,</v>

2697
02:08:23.230 --> 02:08:25.810
<v Speaker 6>can we see that for real?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like this is planets here.</v>

2698
02:08:26.500 --> 02:08:28.810
<v Speaker 6>Like this is like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>

2699
02:08:28.930 --> 02:08:32.440
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck are you looking at there?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Look at that.</v>

2700
02:08:32.530 --> 02:08:34.360
<v Speaker 6>That's a stellar nursery.</v>

2701
02:08:36.550 --> 02:08:41.170
<v Speaker 6>That's a nursery.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like were stars are ejected out into the</v>

2702
02:08:41.171 --> 02:08:44.620
<v Speaker 6>universe or from this gigantic</v>
<v Speaker 6>structure.</v>

2703
02:08:44.740 --> 02:08:46.210
<v Speaker 6>That's probably,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2704
02:08:46.390 --> 02:08:49.090
<v Speaker 6>how fucking bigots and how hot is it</v>
<v Speaker 6>over there?</v>

2705
02:08:49.120 --> 02:08:51.160
<v Speaker 6>Can we even understand how big that is?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2706
02:08:51.161 --> 02:08:53.350
<v Speaker 6>does that even register in our stupid</v>
<v Speaker 6>little brains?</v>

2707
02:08:53.800 --> 02:08:57.430
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you looked at a photo of the earth in</v>

2708
02:08:57.431 --> 02:08:59.260
<v Speaker 6>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what would,</v>

2709
02:08:59.261 --> 02:09:02.150
<v Speaker 6>would it even be visible on that screen?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It would be pro.</v>

2710
02:09:02.230 --> 02:09:05.530
<v Speaker 6>You would probably need to blow it up a</v>
<v Speaker 6>million times.</v>

2711
02:09:05.920 --> 02:09:07.930
<v Speaker 6>You see the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you need a microscope.</v>

2712
02:09:07.960 --> 02:09:11.140
<v Speaker 6>You'd have to look at the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is that,</v>

2713
02:09:11.470 --> 02:09:14.080
<v Speaker 6>what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is that a demon flying through spats it,</v>

2714
02:09:14.081 --> 02:09:16.690
<v Speaker 6>it looks like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but is that real or is that a photo?</v>

2715
02:09:16.810 --> 02:09:18.790
<v Speaker 6>Is that a photo pass?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Telescope captured it.</v>

2716
02:09:19.030 --> 02:09:22.360
<v Speaker 6>What the fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What is that?</v>

2717
02:09:22.990 --> 02:09:27.130
<v Speaker 6>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like just understand for a moment.</v>

2718
02:09:27.130 --> 02:09:31.060
<v Speaker 6>Just try to wrap your head around the</v>
<v Speaker 6>idea that those are infinite sons.</v>

2719
02:09:31.300 --> 02:09:33.220
<v Speaker 6>Those are all sons,</v>
<v Speaker 6>little dots,</v>

2720
02:09:33.221 --> 02:09:36.730
<v Speaker 6>little stars,</v>
<v Speaker 6>most of them way bigger than our son and</v>

2721
02:09:36.731 --> 02:09:40.540
<v Speaker 6>they're all over the fucking place and</v>
<v Speaker 6>it just goes on forever.</v>

2722
02:09:40.541 --> 02:09:43.660
<v Speaker 6>Like our brains can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We can't,</v>

2723
02:09:43.990 --> 02:09:47.950
<v Speaker 6>there's no perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like email today we were talking and uh,</v>

2724
02:09:47.990 --> 02:09:50.620
<v Speaker 6>and I asked you how far are you shooting</v>
<v Speaker 6>your bow?</v>

2725
02:09:51.070 --> 02:09:51.851
<v Speaker 6>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

2726
02:09:51.851 --> 02:09:55.450
<v Speaker 6>I've done some calculations in my phone.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I see 50 yards.</v>

2727
02:09:55.720 --> 02:09:56.291
<v Speaker 6>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>wow,</v>

2728
02:09:56.291 --> 02:09:57.670
<v Speaker 6>you shooting 50 yards?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're like,</v>

2729
02:09:57.671 --> 02:09:57.971
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>go,</v>

2730
02:09:57.971 --> 02:10:01.000
<v Speaker 6>that's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then we go outside and I brought you</v>

2731
02:10:01.001 --> 02:10:02.980
<v Speaker 6>to a target that was 20 yards away and</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're like,</v>

2732
02:10:03.010 --> 02:10:04.450
<v Speaker 6>aw man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can't shoot that far.</v>

2733
02:10:04.690 --> 02:10:05.920
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like that.</v>

2734
02:10:06.640 --> 02:10:11.050
<v Speaker 6>That was a hard moment for me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but just we had an actual detector see</v>

2735
02:10:11.080 --> 02:10:16.000
<v Speaker 6>like it's really hard to just judge</v>
<v Speaker 6>based on like taking footsteps and,</v>

2736
02:10:16.300 --> 02:10:19.030
<v Speaker 6>but with those range finders,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they have these range where we have one</v>

2737
02:10:19.031 --> 02:10:20.800
<v Speaker 6>in here somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This one right here,</v>

2738
02:10:25.940 --> 02:10:27.170
<v Speaker 6>this one.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is a,</v>

2739
02:10:27.650 --> 02:10:29.060
<v Speaker 6>this is what I think that one's for</v>
<v Speaker 6>golf,</v>

2740
02:10:29.360 --> 02:10:32.960
<v Speaker 6>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you press a button on that sucker and it</v>

2741
02:10:33.230 --> 02:10:36.140
<v Speaker 6>an x on the screen.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The other side holding it wrong.</v>

2742
02:10:37.050 --> 02:10:38.570
<v Speaker 6>Don't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>don't cover the lens.</v>

2743
02:10:39.530 --> 02:10:42.680
<v Speaker 6>You press a button on it and it'll show</v>
<v Speaker 6>you how far thing.</v>

2744
02:10:42.681 --> 02:10:44.330
<v Speaker 6>This is probably too close to using</v>
<v Speaker 6>here,</v>

2745
02:10:44.350 --> 02:10:47.450
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Most of them need at least like 10 yards</v>

2746
02:10:47.451 --> 02:10:48.650
<v Speaker 6>or some,</v>
<v Speaker 6>sometimes more,</v>

2747
02:10:48.950 --> 02:10:51.350
<v Speaker 6>sometimes 15 yards.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like the binocular ones.</v>

2748
02:10:51.351 --> 02:10:52.970
<v Speaker 6>They have binocular ones that work that</v>
<v Speaker 6>way.</v>

2749
02:10:52.971 --> 02:10:55.330
<v Speaker 6>They need like 30 yards.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Anything inside of 30 yards.</v>

2750
02:10:55.331 --> 02:10:57.740
<v Speaker 6>I can't detect.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But you,</v>

2751
02:10:57.741 --> 02:10:59.540
<v Speaker 6>we,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we use that and then you get this</v>

2752
02:10:59.541 --> 02:11:02.360
<v Speaker 6>perspective and that's 20 yards to tiny</v>
<v Speaker 6>distance.</v>

2753
02:11:04.160 --> 02:11:08.540
<v Speaker 6>Our sense of what infinity,</v>
<v Speaker 6>infinity and infinity,</v>

2754
02:11:08.720 --> 02:11:11.960
<v Speaker 6>our sense of the infinite space that's</v>
<v Speaker 6>in,</v>

2755
02:11:12.020 --> 02:11:17.020
<v Speaker 6>in the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the idea of a stellar nursery being a</v>

2756
02:11:17.750 --> 02:11:19.580
<v Speaker 6>hundred million light years or whatever</v>
<v Speaker 6>the fuck it is away from us.</v>

2757
02:11:19.581 --> 02:11:21.110
<v Speaker 6>We can't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we can't,</v>

2758
02:11:21.140 --> 02:11:23.000
<v Speaker 6>we can't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We can't imagine.</v>

2759
02:11:23.180 --> 02:11:26.740
<v Speaker 6>It's not available to us.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We still have the same little fucking</v>

2760
02:11:26.750 --> 02:11:29.300
<v Speaker 6>monkey brain.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I was looking at this thing the</v>

2761
02:11:29.301 --> 02:11:31.580
<v Speaker 6>other day of chimps where they showed,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2762
02:11:31.850 --> 02:11:32.330
<v Speaker 6>we,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we,</v>

2763
02:11:32.330 --> 02:11:35.600
<v Speaker 6>we showed her on the podcast the size of</v>
<v Speaker 6>a chimp sprain in comparison to side of</v>

2764
02:11:35.601 --> 02:11:38.570
<v Speaker 6>the size of his testicles.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's insane.</v>

2765
02:11:38.780 --> 02:11:40.660
<v Speaker 6>They're really close.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2766
02:11:40.890 --> 02:11:44.420
<v Speaker 6>Testicles are like that big.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And his brain is like double the size of</v>

2767
02:11:44.421 --> 02:11:45.290
<v Speaker 6>his.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No Way.</v>

2768
02:11:45.350 --> 02:11:46.340
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah.</v>

2769
02:11:46.430 --> 02:11:47.263
<v Speaker 6>Look,</v>

2770
02:11:48.350 --> 02:11:50.060
<v Speaker 3>oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That poor champ.</v>

2771
02:11:51.410 --> 02:11:54.470
<v Speaker 3>That's how we ended up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You poor guy.</v>

2772
02:11:55.020 --> 02:11:59.280
<v Speaker 6>How Sad.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So imagine with our,</v>

2773
02:11:59.520 --> 02:12:02.250
<v Speaker 6>our balls,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which are smaller than his and our</v>

2774
02:12:02.251 --> 02:12:03.780
<v Speaker 6>brains,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which are larger than his,</v>

2775
02:12:04.050 --> 02:12:05.700
<v Speaker 6>and then it's just going to keep going</v>
<v Speaker 6>in that direction.</v>

2776
02:12:06.720 --> 02:12:07.370
<v Speaker 8>Okay,</v>

2777
02:12:07.370 --> 02:12:07.920
<v Speaker 6>but what,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what?</v>

2778
02:12:07.920 --> 02:12:10.020
<v Speaker 6>What we're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what we're dealing with here is this an</v>

2779
02:12:10.021 --> 02:12:12.330
<v Speaker 6>advanced version of that we need way</v>
<v Speaker 6>better.</v>

2780
02:12:12.630 --> 02:12:14.780
<v Speaker 6>We need a better meat wagon.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2781
02:12:14.880 --> 02:12:16.830
<v Speaker 6>In order to be able to comprehend these</v>
<v Speaker 6>numbers,</v>

2782
02:12:16.860 --> 02:12:18.780
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>In order to be able to figure out what</v>

2783
02:12:18.781 --> 02:12:19.830
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what does infinity mean?</v>

2784
02:12:20.020 --> 02:12:20.791
<v Speaker 6>What does,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what does it mean?</v>

2785
02:12:20.791 --> 02:12:23.340
<v Speaker 6>What does a stellar nursery,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what is infinite space?</v>

2786
02:12:23.460 --> 02:12:25.080
<v Speaker 6>What is time?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What is gravity?</v>

2787
02:12:25.200 --> 02:12:26.370
<v Speaker 6>What is all this?</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're,</v>

2788
02:12:26.390 --> 02:12:30.330
<v Speaker 6>we're like repeating shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Have these super fucking geniuses have</v>

2789
02:12:30.331 --> 02:12:34.230
<v Speaker 6>worked their whole life on and we're</v>
<v Speaker 6>butchering it and ruining it in a</v>

2790
02:12:34.231 --> 02:12:36.190
<v Speaker 6>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But what we're,</v>

2791
02:12:36.210 --> 02:12:40.380
<v Speaker 6>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're all doing is we're all slowly but</v>

2792
02:12:40.381 --> 02:12:44.130
<v Speaker 6>surely going to go from being that chimp</v>
<v Speaker 6>to being some new thing.</v>

2793
02:12:44.350 --> 02:12:47.010
<v Speaker 6>Just continue to do it to continue to</v>
<v Speaker 6>grow,</v>

2794
02:12:47.130 --> 02:12:50.580
<v Speaker 6>continue to process and whether it's</v>
<v Speaker 6>through technology or whether it's</v>

2795
02:12:50.581 --> 02:12:54.660
<v Speaker 6>through manipulating our genetics,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're going to become something that</v>

2796
02:12:54.661 --> 02:12:57.500
<v Speaker 6>gets this whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're going to become some new,</v>

2797
02:12:57.700 --> 02:12:58.520
<v Speaker 6>some new things.</v>

2798
02:12:58.520 --> 02:13:00.320
<v Speaker 3>Here's the crazy idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2799
02:13:00.350 --> 02:13:03.410
<v Speaker 3>You're already that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's what this is where it gets really</v>

2800
02:13:03.411 --> 02:13:06.320
<v Speaker 3>fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're already that thing.</v>

2801
02:13:06.590 --> 02:13:09.290
<v Speaker 3>That's the game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The game is you're already that thing</v>

2802
02:13:09.291 --> 02:13:13.040
<v Speaker 3>pretending you're not the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doing some form of recreation that</v>

2803
02:13:13.041 --> 02:13:16.160
<v Speaker 3>involves being astounded by the</v>
<v Speaker 3>infinite,</v>

2804
02:13:16.161 --> 02:13:20.330
<v Speaker 3>enormous size of the universe because of</v>
<v Speaker 3>your particular tiny,</v>

2805
02:13:20.331 --> 02:13:21.950
<v Speaker 3>tiny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tiny little body.</v>

2806
02:13:22.130 --> 02:13:23.390
<v Speaker 3>And so the gate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

2807
02:13:23.420 --> 02:13:28.220
<v Speaker 3>that's the game that we're involved in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You are ready are everything</v>

2808
02:13:28.460 --> 02:13:33.460
<v Speaker 3>experiencing this very temporary oh</v>
<v Speaker 3>illusion of being somehow not a part of</v>

2809
02:13:35.191 --> 02:13:36.570
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You already are,</v>

2810
02:13:36.571 --> 02:13:38.730
<v Speaker 3>the everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your Adams,</v>

2811
02:13:38.880 --> 02:13:40.470
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2812
02:13:41.030 --> 02:13:42.600
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your atomic makeup,</v>

2813
02:13:42.601 --> 02:13:45.720
<v Speaker 3>those atoms inside of you there</v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially infinite.</v>

2814
02:13:45.750 --> 02:13:46.250
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2815
02:13:46.250 --> 02:13:48.390
<v Speaker 3>they will go on forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've talked about this before,</v>

2816
02:13:48.690 --> 02:13:52.470
<v Speaker 3>but that's what you are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You are infinity experiencing itself,</v>

2817
02:13:52.710 --> 02:13:55.590
<v Speaker 3>pretending that you don't know anything</v>
<v Speaker 3>at all.</v>

2818
02:13:55.680 --> 02:13:59.010
<v Speaker 3>And so this head in the sand and we were</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about getting caught in,</v>

2819
02:13:59.040 --> 02:14:01.440
<v Speaker 3>caught up with your bills,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your relationship,</v>

2820
02:14:01.590 --> 02:14:04.140
<v Speaker 3>your hair or my boobs.</v>

2821
02:14:04.140 --> 02:14:07.410
<v Speaker 3>Symmetrical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Am I a good person?</v>

2822
02:14:07.590 --> 02:14:10.500
<v Speaker 3>All of this stuff is very temporary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fleeting,</v>

2823
02:14:10.830 --> 02:14:14.580
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>experience that infinity is having as</v>

2824
02:14:14.581 --> 02:14:17.880
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you are the thing like no matter</v>

2825
02:14:17.881 --> 02:14:22.881
<v Speaker 3>what technological enhancements that</v>
<v Speaker 3>happen that maybe makes you live longer,</v>

2826
02:14:23.700 --> 02:14:25.710
<v Speaker 3>maybe allows you to download your</v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness,</v>

2827
02:14:25.711 --> 02:14:30.660
<v Speaker 3>a new computer experience a million</v>
<v Speaker 3>orgasms at once and wow,</v>

2828
02:14:30.810 --> 02:14:33.060
<v Speaker 3>any of these things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're still,</v>

2829
02:14:34.050 --> 02:14:35.620
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you still are the,</v>

2830
02:14:35.700 --> 02:14:39.780
<v Speaker 3>you still are the infinite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are just distortions in the field</v>

2831
02:14:39.781 --> 02:14:41.790
<v Speaker 3>of experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea is,</v>

2832
02:14:42.120 --> 02:14:47.120
<v Speaker 3>and I think it's a very beautiful idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't need the God damn singularity</v>

2833
02:14:48.540 --> 02:14:52.290
<v Speaker 3>to experience this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't need the singularity to</v>

2834
02:14:52.291 --> 02:14:54.990
<v Speaker 3>experience being something greater than</v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

2835
02:14:54.991 --> 02:14:59.490
<v Speaker 3>You don't need to become a trans human.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't need to become an h plus.</v>

2836
02:14:59.491 --> 02:15:02.670
<v Speaker 3>You don't need to get a chip,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a neural implant in your brain.</v>

2837
02:15:02.940 --> 02:15:06.570
<v Speaker 3>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you just spend enough time sitting,</v>

2838
02:15:06.571 --> 02:15:11.571
<v Speaker 3>still experience what it's like to have</v>
<v Speaker 3>your identity dissolve for a second.</v>

2839
02:15:13.090 --> 02:15:17.070
<v Speaker 3>Not that easy little just sit still and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not just sitting still,</v>

2840
02:15:17.071 --> 02:15:20.130
<v Speaker 3>it's sitting still with a method sitting</v>
<v Speaker 3>still with an understanding of what</v>

2841
02:15:20.131 --> 02:15:22.470
<v Speaker 3>you're trying to achieve.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's still sitting still with tools that</v>

2842
02:15:22.480 --> 02:15:25.680
<v Speaker 3>allow you to manage your consciousness</v>
<v Speaker 3>during this process.</v>

2843
02:15:25.830 --> 02:15:26.340
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2844
02:15:26.340 --> 02:15:29.070
<v Speaker 3>you got to get better at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that if it,</v>

2845
02:15:29.190 --> 02:15:30.690
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you only think it's a,</v>

2846
02:15:30.691 --> 02:15:31.560
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

2847
02:15:31.710 --> 02:15:33.930
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a discipline,</v>

2848
02:15:33.931 --> 02:15:35.460
<v Speaker 3>but the idea of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I mean,</v>

2849
02:15:35.461 --> 02:15:36.690
<v Speaker 3>there's so many different versions of</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2850
02:15:36.720 --> 02:15:38.100
<v Speaker 3>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2851
02:15:38.101 --> 02:15:40.350
<v Speaker 3>some versions have very specific,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2852
02:15:40.530 --> 02:15:44.000
<v Speaker 3>breathing patterns or ways that you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to like the,</v>

2853
02:15:44.020 --> 02:15:46.740
<v Speaker 3>the whatever your meditative technique</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it.</v>

2854
02:15:46.800 --> 02:15:48.660
<v Speaker 3>But then some of them just say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2855
02:15:49.020 --> 02:15:54.020
<v Speaker 3>don't worry about all that bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just find a place anywhere and sit down</v>

2856
02:15:54.061 --> 02:15:55.410
<v Speaker 3>for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2857
02:15:55.411 --> 02:15:56.880
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember once I was asking my</v>

2858
02:15:56.881 --> 02:15:57.990
<v Speaker 3>girlfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was sitting,</v>

2859
02:15:57.991 --> 02:16:01.110
<v Speaker 3>we have this like a Pooja table at our</v>
<v Speaker 3>house is what it's called.</v>

2860
02:16:01.260 --> 02:16:03.810
<v Speaker 3>Highly recommend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It sounds cheesy,</v>

2861
02:16:03.811 --> 02:16:06.210
<v Speaker 3>but it's fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Create a little space.</v>

2862
02:16:06.600 --> 02:16:09.360
<v Speaker 3>Put in that space.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People that you love,</v>

2863
02:16:09.600 --> 02:16:12.600
<v Speaker 3>people that inspire you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people who are awesome doesn't have to</v>

2864
02:16:12.601 --> 02:16:14.070
<v Speaker 3>be Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Virgin Mary.</v>

2865
02:16:14.240 --> 02:16:18.390
<v Speaker 3>It could be anybody you're inspired by</v>
<v Speaker 3>creative space with these pictures.</v>

2866
02:16:18.540 --> 02:16:22.650
<v Speaker 3>And then maybe throw a picture on there</v>
<v Speaker 3>as somebody that you fucking hate and</v>

2867
02:16:22.651 --> 02:16:25.710
<v Speaker 3>you sit in front of this uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing and you just like,</v>

2868
02:16:25.711 --> 02:16:29.860
<v Speaker 3>look at these people that you love and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then maybe you at the person that you</v>

2869
02:16:29.861 --> 02:16:34.810
<v Speaker 3>don't like so much and you try to</v>
<v Speaker 3>transfer that love to that person to</v>

2870
02:16:34.811 --> 02:16:37.660
<v Speaker 3>clear out the Guy Dan winning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whenever you hate anybody,</v>

2871
02:16:37.661 --> 02:16:40.750
<v Speaker 3>your operating systems got a bit of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>disturbance in it.</v>

2872
02:16:40.751 --> 02:16:43.150
<v Speaker 3>So you want to like fix that connection</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you can.</v>

2873
02:16:43.151 --> 02:16:45.220
<v Speaker 3>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's just sitting in front of this,</v>

2874
02:16:45.221 --> 02:16:45.941
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pooja table.</v>

2875
02:16:45.941 --> 02:16:46.900
<v Speaker 3>We haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I asked her,</v>

2876
02:16:47.290 --> 02:16:48.250
<v Speaker 3>are you meditating?</v>

2877
02:16:48.490 --> 02:16:50.380
<v Speaker 3>I shouldn't have done that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's rude if someone's meditating.</v>

2878
02:16:50.381 --> 02:16:51.340
<v Speaker 3>But I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you meditating?</v>

2879
02:16:51.341 --> 02:16:53.200
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now I'm just sitting here.</v>

2880
02:16:53.590 --> 02:16:55.510
<v Speaker 3>I thought that was so funny because it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2881
02:16:55.540 --> 02:16:56.500
<v Speaker 3>oh right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not,</v>

2882
02:16:56.560 --> 02:16:58.600
<v Speaker 3>you're not officially meditating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just sitting.</v>

2883
02:16:58.810 --> 02:17:01.630
<v Speaker 3>But if you look at what zen means or</v>
<v Speaker 3>what someone told me,</v>

2884
02:17:01.810 --> 02:17:05.140
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] means the zen meditation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it means just sit.</v>

2885
02:17:05.590 --> 02:17:09.190
<v Speaker 3>There's no big anything to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's not some fabulous,</v>

2886
02:17:09.191 --> 02:17:11.230
<v Speaker 3>incredible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>insane thing you're doing.</v>

2887
02:17:11.440 --> 02:17:15.880
<v Speaker 3>Just ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when was the last time I sat and didn't</v>

2888
02:17:15.881 --> 02:17:18.880
<v Speaker 3>move for five minutes?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When was that?</v>

2889
02:17:19.420 --> 02:17:20.253
<v Speaker 3>When was it?</v>

2890
02:17:20.810 --> 02:17:21.641
<v Speaker 2>I think you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2891
02:17:21.641 --> 02:17:26.300
<v Speaker 2>you're looking for all the same things</v>
<v Speaker 2>in so many different things that we do.</v>

2892
02:17:26.420 --> 02:17:30.770
<v Speaker 2>I think we're all looking for this</v>
<v Speaker 2>moment where everything sort of syncs up</v>

2893
02:17:30.771 --> 02:17:34.040
<v Speaker 2>and make sense and feels harmonious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2894
02:17:34.041 --> 02:17:35.990
<v Speaker 2>and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate to bring it back to archery</v>

2895
02:17:35.991 --> 02:17:37.910
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that's what you're really</v>

2896
02:17:37.911 --> 02:17:40.820
<v Speaker 2>enjoying about those moments when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>release that Arrow.</v>

2897
02:17:41.120 --> 02:17:44.780
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm seeing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I watched you a shoot some arrows today</v>

2898
02:17:45.080 --> 02:17:48.140
<v Speaker 2>and I'm seeing like this pleasure in</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

2899
02:17:48.141 --> 02:17:51.170
<v Speaker 2>Like when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in the proper stance and you're</v>

2900
02:17:51.171 --> 02:17:55.100
<v Speaker 2>releasing the Arrow and you're watching</v>
<v Speaker 2>the path and everything looks good and</v>

2901
02:17:55.101 --> 02:18:00.050
<v Speaker 2>you're releasing it and there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you have mastered that moment,</v>

2902
02:18:00.080 --> 02:18:02.360
<v Speaker 2>even for a second or two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see this?</v>

2903
02:18:03.170 --> 02:18:05.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See this burst of off the bat,</v>

2904
02:18:05.990 --> 02:18:09.110
<v Speaker 2>you're not there anymore and your</v>
<v Speaker 2>existing through the shots,</v>

<v Speaker 2>podcast you're existing through making</v>

<v Speaker 2>your girlfriend come your existing</v>
<v Speaker 2>through waving to a friend,</v>

2908
02:18:18.861 --> 02:18:21.670

<v Speaker 2>that you give other people when they're</v>

2909

<v Speaker 2>around you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2910
02:18:22.650 --> 02:18:24.890
<v Speaker 2>Your existing through those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2911
02:18:25.140 --> 02:18:25.821
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and those,</v>

2912
02:18:25.821 --> 02:18:28.610
<v Speaker 2>when you nail it in all forms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all,</v>

2913
02:18:28.640 --> 02:18:30.500
<v Speaker 2>they're all similar and related.</v>

2914
02:18:30.870 --> 02:18:31.621
<v Speaker 3>That's right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2915
02:18:31.621 --> 02:18:33.600
<v Speaker 3>They're all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they all have at their core the same</v>

2916
02:18:33.601 --> 02:18:34.434
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

2917
02:18:34.440 --> 02:18:35.530
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're at,</v>

2918
02:18:35.550 --> 02:18:39.430
<v Speaker 3>you're touching the core of what you</v>
<v Speaker 3>really are and,</v>

2919
02:18:39.440 --> 02:18:41.530
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why meditation is,</v>

2920
02:18:41.550 --> 02:18:44.600
<v Speaker 3>I think is so incredibly misunderstood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2921
02:18:44.820 --> 02:18:46.770
<v Speaker 3>and something that really isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't,</v>

2922
02:18:47.670 --> 02:18:50.610
<v Speaker 3>isn't that different from any other</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing that you're doing.</v>

2923
02:18:50.750 --> 02:18:50.960
<v Speaker 3>Boat</v>

2924
02:18:50.960 --> 02:18:52.370
<v Speaker 2>float tanks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2925
02:18:52.371 --> 02:18:53.390
<v Speaker 2>Float tanks is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>

2926
02:18:53.391 --> 02:18:56.000
<v Speaker 2>that's the real meditation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's meditation advanced.</v>

2927
02:18:56.600 --> 02:18:59.930
<v Speaker 2>If you want a vacation from life in an</v>
<v Speaker 2>ability to step back and really look at</v>

2928
02:18:59.931 --> 02:19:00.860
<v Speaker 2>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2929
02:19:00.861 --> 02:19:03.380
<v Speaker 2>You could sit in the corner and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>could just do it that way and there's</v>

2930
02:19:03.381 --> 02:19:06.380
<v Speaker 2>nothing wrong with doing it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing wrong with going out on</v>

2931
02:19:06.381 --> 02:19:10.160
<v Speaker 2>a hill and sitting in and just</v>
<v Speaker 2>overlooking a beautiful field and taking</v>

2932
02:19:10.161 --> 02:19:13.570
<v Speaker 2>in nature and in meditating in that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a meditation in another.</v>

2933
02:19:13.580 --> 02:19:16.220
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like an energy absorption.</v>

2934
02:19:16.460 --> 02:19:18.920
<v Speaker 2>Like you taking some power off the</v>
<v Speaker 2>battery,</v>

2935
02:19:18.921 --> 02:19:21.110
<v Speaker 2>like you're feeding it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're feeding off of it,</v>

2936
02:19:21.380 --> 02:19:23.870
<v Speaker 2>but the float tank is where it's at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2937
02:19:24.130 --> 02:19:26.570
<v Speaker 2>and that those fucking things are</v>
<v Speaker 2>exploding now.</v>

2938
02:19:26.571 --> 02:19:28.190
<v Speaker 2>People are it now</v>

2939
02:19:28.190 --> 02:19:31.370
<v Speaker 1>for the first time in decades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how important those things are.</v>

2940
02:19:31.580 --> 02:19:34.280
<v Speaker 1>There was this big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a story that I printed the other day</v>

2941
02:19:34.281 --> 02:19:35.600
<v Speaker 1>about the basketball team,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2942
02:19:35.601 --> 02:19:37.970
<v Speaker 1>the um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was the golden state warriors.</v>

2943
02:19:38.150 --> 02:19:39.980
<v Speaker 1>They use it every week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make sense?</v>

2944
02:19:40.530 --> 02:19:42.170
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fucking biggest one in the world</v>

2945
02:19:42.200 --> 02:19:44.720
<v Speaker 1>just opened up in Pasadena,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just float,</v>

2946
02:19:45.480 --> 02:19:47.570
<v Speaker 1>float lab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just open up one in Westwood.</v>

2947
02:19:47.571 --> 02:19:49.400
<v Speaker 1>They opened up a big location in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Westwood.</v>

2948
02:19:49.580 --> 02:19:50.930
<v Speaker 1>They're exploding now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're everywhere.</v>

2949
02:19:50.931 --> 02:19:54.260
<v Speaker 1>They're all over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People love it for finally getting it.</v>

2950
02:19:54.261 --> 02:19:59.000
<v Speaker 1>People are finally getting it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This thing is like the best way to have</v>

2951
02:19:59.001 --> 02:20:02.810
<v Speaker 1>a vacation from your thoughts or to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>alone with them rather have vacation</v>

2952
02:20:02.811 --> 02:20:04.820
<v Speaker 1>from your body I should say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's great cause you're,</v>

2953
02:20:04.821 --> 02:20:07.360
<v Speaker 1>you're peeling away all the goddamn</v>
<v Speaker 1>stimulus.</v>

2954
02:20:07.361 --> 02:20:09.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess if there is like with</v>

2955
02:20:09.201 --> 02:20:12.440
<v Speaker 1>meditation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there was some kind of like well they</v>

2956
02:20:12.441 --> 02:20:15.590
<v Speaker 1>do call it a practice but the reason</v>
<v Speaker 1>they call it a practice it's because a</v>

2957
02:20:15.591 --> 02:20:20.300
<v Speaker 1>lot of meditation is like you're sitting</v>
<v Speaker 1>there and the dog will start barking.</v>

2958
02:20:20.300 --> 02:20:21.430
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2959
02:20:21.590 --> 02:20:22.520
<v Speaker 1>got to kick it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2960
02:20:22.521 --> 02:20:24.740
<v Speaker 1>Well you got to throw it into the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My die.</v>

2961
02:20:24.770 --> 02:20:29.300
<v Speaker 1>You have to see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you sort of like this is,</v>

2962
02:20:29.330 --> 02:20:30.290
<v Speaker 1>this is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just kidding.</v>

2963
02:20:30.291 --> 02:20:33.020
<v Speaker 1>Of course guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're meditating you get up and</v>

2964
02:20:33.021 --> 02:20:36.290
<v Speaker 1>throw your dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this is like a so,</v>

2965
02:20:36.800 --> 02:20:41.090
<v Speaker 1>so like a rom dass talks about like</v>
<v Speaker 1>giving this meditation class and people</v>

2966
02:20:41.091 --> 02:20:44.090
<v Speaker 1>are meditating and there was like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>siren that kept going off and people are</v>

2967
02:20:44.091 --> 02:20:46.220
<v Speaker 1>getting annoyed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like buy a firehouse I guess.</v>

2968
02:20:46.790 --> 02:20:49.370
<v Speaker 1>So the fire truck would leave or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fire truck would come in.</v>

2969
02:20:49.371 --> 02:20:50.780
<v Speaker 1>People are getting annoyed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can't meditate.</v>

2970
02:20:50.781 --> 02:20:52.220
<v Speaker 1>There's always a siren.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

2971
02:20:53.180 --> 02:20:55.730
<v Speaker 1>that's just energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you were hearing.</v>

2972
02:20:56.270 --> 02:21:01.250
<v Speaker 1>This is just energy going into your body</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your body is turning into the sound</v>

2973
02:21:01.251 --> 02:21:04.100
<v Speaker 1>of a siren.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this is just grist for the mill is</v>

2974
02:21:04.101 --> 02:21:04.640
<v Speaker 1>what he called it.</v>

2975
02:21:04.640 --> 02:21:09.170
<v Speaker 1>This is just another form that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>universe takes the sound of a siren.</v>

2976
02:21:09.440 --> 02:21:12.620
<v Speaker 1>And so when you're meditating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start watching yourself,</v>

2977
02:21:12.621 --> 02:21:14.630
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So and uh,</v>

2978
02:21:15.050 --> 02:21:17.540
<v Speaker 1>so the dog barked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if I'm sitting meditating,</v>

2979
02:21:17.660 --> 02:21:21.680
<v Speaker 1>the dog would bark and I will watch</v>
<v Speaker 1>myself.</v>

2980
02:21:21.681 --> 02:21:25.880
<v Speaker 1>So now I watched the way that my body</v>
<v Speaker 1>reacts and the Dog Barks and the</v>

2981
02:21:25.881 --> 02:21:29.510
<v Speaker 1>physical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of like a very slight tensing up to</v>

2982
02:21:29.900 --> 02:21:33.260
<v Speaker 1>inside a feeling fucking frustration who</v>
<v Speaker 1>struggled.</v>

2983
02:21:33.280 --> 02:21:34.940
<v Speaker 1>Shut the fuck up and net.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm,</v>

2984
02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:38.600
<v Speaker 1>but now I'm watching that so well this</v>
<v Speaker 1>is what I do and I'm annoyed by</v>

2985
02:21:38.601 --> 02:21:40.370
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now you can watch the way that</v>

2986
02:21:40.371 --> 02:21:45.371
<v Speaker 1>annoying feeling emerges and dissipates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's like the meditative process.</v>

2987
02:21:45.501 --> 02:21:50.450
<v Speaker 1>Whereas a float tank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're stripping that extra thing away.</v>

2988
02:21:50.480 --> 02:21:54.350
<v Speaker 1>So now it's just the sense of being</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

2989
02:21:54.530 --> 02:21:56.720
<v Speaker 1>minus having to deal with it</v>
<v Speaker 1>disturbances so much.</v>

2990
02:21:56.900 --> 02:21:59.600
<v Speaker 1>Even though they are in a float tank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll still get some disturbances.</v>

2991
02:21:59.600 --> 02:22:00.433
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

2992
02:22:00.740 --> 02:22:03.800
<v Speaker 1>you'll notice the way the air that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're breathing or you'll feel some</v>

2993
02:22:03.801 --> 02:22:08.000
<v Speaker 1>burn where there's like a cut on your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe a drop of water will land and hit</v>

2994
02:22:08.001 --> 02:22:11.900
<v Speaker 1>you in the head or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we've got a squeegee the roof before</v>

2995
02:22:11.901 --> 02:22:13.280
<v Speaker 1>you go in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a big part of it.</v>

2996
02:22:14.120 --> 02:22:14.661
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2997
02:22:14.661 --> 02:22:16.520
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guys who have invented some</v>

2998
02:22:16.790 --> 02:22:19.190
<v Speaker 1>workarounds for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a guy that owns a place in</v>

2999
02:22:19.191 --> 02:22:21.860
<v Speaker 1>Austin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a zero gravity in Austin.</v>

3000
02:22:21.861 --> 02:22:23.810
<v Speaker 1>He's figured out a way to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3001
02:22:23.960 --> 02:22:25.210
<v Speaker 1>he's got a different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

3002
02:22:25.270 --> 02:22:25.980
<v Speaker 1>his are made out of</v>

3003
02:22:25.980 --> 02:22:26.970
<v Speaker 6>like ship holes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3004
02:22:26.971 --> 02:22:28.410
<v Speaker 6>They don't trip,</v>
<v Speaker 6>don't trip.</v>

3005
02:22:28.440 --> 02:22:33.000
<v Speaker 6>And he's also got some sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a way to ventilate the a,</v>

3006
02:22:33.001 --> 02:22:36.530
<v Speaker 6>so there's no condensation on the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>on the roof of his tanks here and</v>

3007
02:22:36.531 --> 02:22:38.280
<v Speaker 6>credible.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's Kevin Johnson.</v>

3008
02:22:38.730 --> 02:22:40.770
<v Speaker 6>Great Guy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Cool Texas.</v>

3009
02:22:40.800 --> 02:22:42.150
<v Speaker 6>If you're there,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's a great spot.</v>

3010
02:22:42.450 --> 02:22:43.283
<v Speaker 6>But,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

3011
02:22:43.460 --> 02:22:44.340
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but mine,</v>

3012
02:22:44.341 --> 02:22:47.280
<v Speaker 6>I just give it a once over with the</v>
<v Speaker 6>squeegee when I climb in.</v>

3013
02:22:47.400 --> 02:22:50.670
<v Speaker 6>But those one of those things about like</v>
<v Speaker 6>the itches and the all the bullshit</v>

3014
02:22:50.850 --> 02:22:53.070
<v Speaker 6>other than the dripping of the water,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's all in your head.</v>

3015
02:22:53.130 --> 02:22:56.130
<v Speaker 6>You just need to spend enough time in</v>
<v Speaker 6>those things.</v>

3016
02:22:56.131 --> 02:22:58.290
<v Speaker 6>Like I don't experience that anymore</v>
<v Speaker 6>when I get in the,</v>

3017
02:22:58.291 --> 02:23:02.670
<v Speaker 6>even if I have like a scratch,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like Jujitsu scratches were a problem</v>

3018
02:23:02.850 --> 02:23:05.880
<v Speaker 6>because like a lot of times dudes don't</v>
<v Speaker 6>trim the nails and you get really</v>

3019
02:23:05.881 --> 02:23:09.600
<v Speaker 6>scratched up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But the good thing is the fucking salt</v>

3020
02:23:09.601 --> 02:23:12.830
<v Speaker 6>bath kills Era Thang Aero Thang.</v>

3021
02:23:12.990 --> 02:23:15.360
<v Speaker 6>I mean all the nasty funky shit on your</v>
<v Speaker 6>skin.</v>

3022
02:23:15.480 --> 02:23:18.390
<v Speaker 6>That's salt torches.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It cause you're talking about thousand</v>

3023
02:23:18.391 --> 02:23:21.210
<v Speaker 6>pounds of Epson Salts.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Super healthy for your body.</v>

3024
02:23:21.420 --> 02:23:24.810
<v Speaker 6>So you just gotta suffer through a few</v>
<v Speaker 6>seconds of stinging if you've got to</v>

3025
02:23:24.811 --> 02:23:27.810
<v Speaker 6>scratch but just breathe.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All you have to do is concentrate on</v>

3026
02:23:27.811 --> 02:23:30.150
<v Speaker 6>your breath.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The key to the tank is breathing in and</v>

3027
02:23:30.151 --> 02:23:31.530
<v Speaker 6>breathing out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just nothing.</v>

3028
02:23:31.531 --> 02:23:35.150
<v Speaker 6>But that put all of your energy on in</v>
<v Speaker 6>with the good and out with the bad.</v>

3029
02:23:35.650 --> 02:23:39.300
<v Speaker 6>With the good and out with the bath and</v>
<v Speaker 6>then I stopped assigning it a purpose.</v>

3030
02:23:39.301 --> 02:23:40.580
<v Speaker 6>I started assigning and get a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3031
02:23:40.610 --> 02:23:43.560
<v Speaker 6>like a quality or a positive or a</v>
<v Speaker 6>negative.</v>

3032
02:23:43.800 --> 02:23:47.250
<v Speaker 6>I just breathe and breathe in and I</v>
<v Speaker 6>don't allow myself every now and then,</v>

3033
02:23:47.251 --> 02:23:49.290
<v Speaker 6>my mind wants to start going about,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

3034
02:23:49.291 --> 02:23:50.880
<v Speaker 6>you've got to work on that new bit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's new bins.</v>

3035
02:23:50.880 --> 02:23:53.070
<v Speaker 6>Fucking got a wheel hitch in it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You've got to abandon this.</v>

3036
02:23:53.071 --> 02:23:54.720
<v Speaker 6>Shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Shut the fuck up.</v>

3037
02:23:55.090 --> 02:23:56.160
<v Speaker 6>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>ah man.</v>

3038
02:23:56.280 --> 02:23:57.600
<v Speaker 6>When are you going to fucking clean your</v>
<v Speaker 6>office?</v>

3039
02:23:57.601 --> 02:24:00.720
<v Speaker 6>Shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Shut the fuck up and what I'm doing.</v>

3040
02:24:00.840 --> 02:24:05.840
<v Speaker 6>And then you can bypass the land of</v>
<v Speaker 6>trouble and confusion.</v>

3041
02:24:07.020 --> 02:24:09.840
<v Speaker 6>There's like a land of trouble and</v>
<v Speaker 6>confusion that takes about 20 minutes to</v>

3042
02:24:09.841 --> 02:24:13.170
<v Speaker 6>get through and you to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she's fucking hustle through that land</v>

3043
02:24:13.171 --> 02:24:15.240
<v Speaker 6>and you've got to do the work.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You got to fucking concentrate on the</v>

3044
02:24:15.241 --> 02:24:18.390
<v Speaker 6>breathing because if you give in to the</v>
<v Speaker 6>land of trouble and confusion,</v>

3045
02:24:18.391 --> 02:24:20.820
<v Speaker 6>but let me just hang out here and talk</v>
<v Speaker 6>to you guys for awhile.</v>

3046
02:24:20.970 --> 02:24:24.010
<v Speaker 6>They'll fucking drag you into their</v>
<v Speaker 6>come.</v>

3047
02:24:25.190 --> 02:24:26.700
<v Speaker 6>Let's talk about your girlfriend from</v>
<v Speaker 6>high school.</v>

3048
02:24:26.701 --> 02:24:28.470
<v Speaker 6>Maybe if you guys got back together and</v>
<v Speaker 6>you'd be happy,</v>

3049
02:24:30.360 --> 02:24:31.740
<v Speaker 6>maybe Janine,</v>
<v Speaker 6>amazing story.</v>

3050
02:24:31.740 --> 02:24:32.870
<v Speaker 6>She's got kids,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you've got cage,</v>

3051
02:24:32.871 --> 02:24:34.160
<v Speaker 6>you both pick up,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3052
02:24:34.490 --> 02:24:35.660
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know what I mean?</v>

3053
02:24:35.670 --> 02:24:37.710
<v Speaker 6>I'm pretty sure is a con.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

3054
02:24:37.711 --> 02:24:39.360
<v Speaker 6>You always a con,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you gotta tell the fucking business</v>

3055
02:24:39.361 --> 02:24:44.361
<v Speaker 6>manager and you start having these like</v>
<v Speaker 6>wars in your head about your life that</v>

3056
02:24:44.701 --> 02:24:48.060
<v Speaker 6>are totally unnecessary and</v>
<v Speaker 6>counterintuitive to what you're trying</v>

3057
02:24:48.061 --> 02:24:49.920
<v Speaker 6>to do there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We try and do there as escape,</v>

3058
02:24:49.980 --> 02:24:54.980
<v Speaker 6>escape the whole thing by concentrate.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's why yoga is the shit because yoga</v>

3059
02:24:54.991 --> 02:24:57.780
<v Speaker 6>is hard to do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just like archery is hard to do when</v>

3060
02:24:57.781 --> 02:25:00.770
<v Speaker 6>you're standing there and you've got the</v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking one foot up and you're</v>

3061
02:25:00.950 --> 02:25:02.900
<v Speaker 6>stretching up like this and you're</v>
<v Speaker 6>holding it,</v>

3062
02:25:02.920 --> 02:25:04.980
<v Speaker 6>your whole body shaking and they're</v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

3063
02:25:04.981 --> 02:25:06.480
<v Speaker 6>hold,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hold</v>

3064
02:25:08.130 --> 02:25:10.200
<v Speaker 6>and not thinking about anything other</v>
<v Speaker 6>than,</v>

3065
02:25:10.201 --> 02:25:12.420
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>breathing and trying to do that because</v>

3066
02:25:12.421 --> 02:25:16.920
<v Speaker 6>he can't do it when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when it's a swipe at that beak from</v>

3067
02:25:16.921 --> 02:25:18.180
<v Speaker 6>guy's a scumbag,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but he's,</v>

3068
02:25:18.181 --> 02:25:19.440
<v Speaker 6>he had a fucking great idea.</v>

3069
02:25:19.610 --> 02:25:20.820
<v Speaker 6>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 6>get a great idea.</v>

3070
02:25:20.821 --> 02:25:23.830
<v Speaker 6>Then 104 temperature to that tests your</v>
<v Speaker 6>will.</v>

3071
02:25:23.950 --> 02:25:26.110
<v Speaker 6>It does something to your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3072
02:25:26.111 --> 02:25:29.350
<v Speaker 6>Doctor Rhonda Patrick thinks it might</v>
<v Speaker 6>create something called heat shock</v>

3073
02:25:29.351 --> 02:25:31.920
<v Speaker 6>proteins that you get from a sauna.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Citizens,</v>

3074
02:25:31.921 --> 02:25:34.990
<v Speaker 6>there's a positive benefit health wise</v>
<v Speaker 6>to being in a sauna,</v>

3075
02:25:35.020 --> 02:25:36.100
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Very positive.</v>

3076
02:25:36.101 --> 02:25:39.720
<v Speaker 6>To a point where she was saying that</v>
<v Speaker 6>there was a 40% reduction in mortalities</v>

3077
02:25:39.730 --> 02:25:42.910
<v Speaker 6>across the board from people that are</v>
<v Speaker 6>regular saw users,</v>

3078
02:25:43.060 --> 02:25:45.270
<v Speaker 6>40% reduction in cancers,</v>
<v Speaker 6>heart attacks,</v>

3079
02:25:45.271 --> 02:25:46.240
<v Speaker 6>stroke,</v>
<v Speaker 6>all those things,</v>

3080
02:25:46.420 --> 02:25:49.120
<v Speaker 6>massive mortality dropoff because the</v>
<v Speaker 6>sauna,</v>

3081
02:25:49.300 --> 02:25:51.730
<v Speaker 6>because your body produces these heat</v>
<v Speaker 6>shock proteins,</v>

3082
02:25:51.940 --> 02:25:53.710
<v Speaker 6>she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it could very well be going on in those</v>

3083
02:25:53.711 --> 02:25:55.780
<v Speaker 6>classes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're so fucking hot right here.</v>

3084
02:25:55.840 --> 02:25:57.970
<v Speaker 6>Your body's overheating.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's freaking the fuck out.</v>

3085
02:25:58.090 --> 02:26:01.720
<v Speaker 6>So 140 degrees in there and you're doing</v>
<v Speaker 6>unbelievably strenuous exercise.</v>

3086
02:26:02.740 --> 02:26:06.760
<v Speaker 6>I think there's all these different</v>
<v Speaker 6>methods that we have come up with,</v>

3087
02:26:06.761 --> 02:26:09.460
<v Speaker 6>whether it's martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whether it's yoga,</v>

3088
02:26:09.610 --> 02:26:11.890
<v Speaker 6>whether it's meditation,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whether it's the tank,</v>

3089
02:26:12.010 --> 02:26:17.010
<v Speaker 6>they're all trying to get away from the</v>
<v Speaker 6>influence of the fucking primate DNA,</v>

3090
02:26:19.040 --> 02:26:19.570
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3091
02:26:19.570 --> 02:26:21.160
<v Speaker 6>All of it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The jealousy,</v>

3092
02:26:21.400 --> 02:26:24.790
<v Speaker 6>the tha,</v>
<v Speaker 6>tha tha tha tha wanton materialism.</v>

3093
02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:29.710
<v Speaker 6>The fucking anger and traffic and the</v>
<v Speaker 6>nonsense about your career and the</v>

3094
02:26:29.890 --> 02:26:34.060
<v Speaker 6>interpersonal relationship bullshit that</v>
<v Speaker 6>we put ourselves through back and forth.</v>

3095
02:26:34.470 --> 02:26:39.470
<v Speaker 6>A big part of it all is a perspective</v>
<v Speaker 6>that was inherited.</v>

3096
02:26:39.520 --> 02:26:42.220
<v Speaker 6>We inherited it from these fucking</v>
<v Speaker 6>barbarians,</v>

3097
02:26:42.240 --> 02:26:45.310
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>That came in each other and just barely</v>

3098
02:26:45.311 --> 02:26:46.720
<v Speaker 6>made it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They fucking,</v>

3099
02:26:46.721 --> 02:26:50.040
<v Speaker 6>they did live to be 10 and they did fuck</v>
<v Speaker 6>somebody else and meet people.</v>

3100
02:26:50.041 --> 02:26:52.360
<v Speaker 6>We're probably getting pregnant when</v>
<v Speaker 6>they were six years old back then,</v>

3101
02:26:52.500 --> 02:26:53.860
<v Speaker 6>but who knows what the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We were like,</v>

3102
02:26:53.861 --> 02:26:55.040
<v Speaker 6>we're a month.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3103
02:26:55.210 --> 02:26:58.660
<v Speaker 6>we had to become what we are today,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but we're trapped.</v>

3104
02:26:58.930 --> 02:27:02.170
<v Speaker 6>We're trapped with the momentum of that</v>
<v Speaker 6>shit in our bodies.</v>

3105
02:27:02.200 --> 02:27:04.480
<v Speaker 6>Trapped,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not trapped.</v>

3106
02:27:04.660 --> 02:27:07.870
<v Speaker 6>You can escape,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but hindered to the point where it</v>

3107
02:27:07.871 --> 02:27:09.880
<v Speaker 6>requires,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it requires input.</v>

3108
02:27:10.150 --> 02:27:12.880
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the w attached.</v>

3109
02:27:12.910 --> 02:27:15.790
<v Speaker 3>This is why I like the word attached.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're attached to it.</v>

3110
02:27:16.030 --> 02:27:18.160
<v Speaker 3>You're cleaning to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're holding onto it.</v>

3111
02:27:18.460 --> 02:27:23.460
<v Speaker 3>You're carrying around this like just a</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking stinking corpse that you think</v>

3112
02:27:24.191 --> 02:27:26.440
<v Speaker 3>is who you are and you're clinging to</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

3113
02:27:26.441 --> 02:27:29.290
<v Speaker 3>That's the land that you're talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about that you're going through and</v>

3114
02:27:29.291 --> 02:27:32.590
<v Speaker 3>people don't wanna let go of that</v>
<v Speaker 3>because that is what defines you.</v>

3115
02:27:32.800 --> 02:27:35.980
<v Speaker 3>That's everything that you are and</v>
<v Speaker 3>people want to be to find.</v>

3116
02:27:36.010 --> 02:27:39.730
<v Speaker 3>They would rather be defined then they</v>
<v Speaker 3>would be by being undefined.</v>

3117
02:27:39.840 --> 02:27:41.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when you've,</v>

3118
02:27:41.021 --> 02:27:42.700
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you've sailed through,</v>

3119
02:27:42.910 --> 02:27:44.860
<v Speaker 3>what did you call the land of trouble</v>
<v Speaker 3>and despair?</v>

3120
02:27:44.880 --> 02:27:46.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you've sailed through the land of</v>

3121
02:27:46.451 --> 02:27:48.460
<v Speaker 3>trouble in his space.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's 20 minutes.</v>

3122
02:27:48.610 --> 02:27:52.390
<v Speaker 3>So what's after that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How would you describe the state after</v>

3123
02:27:52.391 --> 02:27:53.010
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>

3124
02:27:53.010 --> 02:27:55.260
<v Speaker 6>The state after that is where it gets</v>
<v Speaker 6>psychedelic.</v>

3125
02:27:55.610 --> 02:27:59.880
<v Speaker 6>The state after that is where you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you don't exist anymore and you're just,</v>

3126
02:28:00.240 --> 02:28:04.020
<v Speaker 6>you're intertwining yourself with</v>
<v Speaker 6>information and ideas and these ideas</v>

3127
02:28:04.021 --> 02:28:06.240
<v Speaker 6>are bouncing around your head,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you don't really consider yourself</v>

3128
02:28:06.241 --> 02:28:07.770
<v Speaker 6>as you is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you do,</v>

3129
02:28:07.771 --> 02:28:09.840
<v Speaker 6>you'll snap out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>One of the weirder things about the</v>

3130
02:28:09.841 --> 02:28:13.800
<v Speaker 6>psychedelic trance that you get from the</v>
<v Speaker 6>tank is that it's so pliable and go in</v>

3131
02:28:13.801 --> 02:28:16.320
<v Speaker 6>it and out of it and sometimes I lose it</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I'm done.</v>

3132
02:28:16.350 --> 02:28:19.740
<v Speaker 6>I'm just laying there for the next hour,</v>
<v Speaker 6>for the next hour it's gone.</v>

3133
02:28:20.190 --> 02:28:21.030
<v Speaker 6>I'll brie.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They'll do,</v>

3134
02:28:21.110 --> 02:28:23.170
<v Speaker 6>but it was whatever it was was such a</v>
<v Speaker 6>whipple,</v>

3135
02:28:23.420 --> 02:28:28.420
<v Speaker 6>such a right,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so strange and odd and bizarre and non</v>

3136
02:28:28.820 --> 02:28:31.180
<v Speaker 6>non non dimensional.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't,</v>

3137
02:28:31.190 --> 02:28:34.460
<v Speaker 6>doesn't pertain to anything that you</v>
<v Speaker 6>experienced in this dimension.</v>

3138
02:28:34.940 --> 02:28:38.570
<v Speaker 6>So you become something when your body</v>
<v Speaker 6>is free of your mind,</v>

3139
02:28:38.780 --> 02:28:41.540
<v Speaker 6>when your mind is free of your past,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when you just,</v>

3140
02:28:41.600 --> 02:28:42.530
<v Speaker 6>you escape.</v>

3141
02:28:42.770 --> 02:28:45.740
<v Speaker 6>It's almost like you're pulling your,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's like almost like a gravitational</v>

3142
02:28:45.741 --> 02:28:49.520
<v Speaker 6>pull or an atmosphere rather.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well you pop out of that atmosphere like</v>

3143
02:28:49.521 --> 02:28:52.910
<v Speaker 6>a rocket that shoots up into space and</v>
<v Speaker 6>you float around for a little while.</v>

3144
02:28:52.920 --> 02:28:54.890
<v Speaker 6>Then you come back down and deal with</v>
<v Speaker 6>the bullshit again.</v>

3145
02:28:55.190 --> 02:28:58.190
<v Speaker 6>But you're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when you pop out of the land of trouble</v>

3146
02:28:58.191 --> 02:29:00.680
<v Speaker 6>and despair,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's like you're floating in zero</v>

3147
02:29:00.681 --> 02:29:04.100
<v Speaker 6>gravity because you're in the tank.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You literally feel like you're in zero</v>

3148
02:29:04.101 --> 02:29:06.860
<v Speaker 6>gravity because you don't feel anything</v>
<v Speaker 6>anymore because once you've relaxed to</v>

3149
02:29:06.861 --> 02:29:09.920
<v Speaker 6>the point where the water is no longer</v>
<v Speaker 6>distinguishable,</v>

3150
02:29:10.250 --> 02:29:12.350
<v Speaker 6>the air and the water,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the same thing and you just feel like</v>

3151
02:29:12.351 --> 02:29:14.360
<v Speaker 6>you're floating.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's where it's at,</v>

3152
02:29:14.361 --> 02:29:16.060
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You've got to get to that space when you</v>

3153
02:29:16.061 --> 02:29:19.570
<v Speaker 6>bought is just totally stopped moving</v>
<v Speaker 6>and when you get to that space in your</v>

3154
02:29:19.571 --> 02:29:24.410
<v Speaker 6>body is totally stopped moving and</v>
<v Speaker 6>you've gone through the land of trouble</v>

3155
02:29:24.411 --> 02:29:26.990
<v Speaker 6>and despair.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You just get to the place of just</v>

3156
02:29:28.100 --> 02:29:30.890
<v Speaker 6>thought.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You get to the place of thought.</v>

3157
02:29:30.891 --> 02:29:35.891
<v Speaker 6>That's free of all the culture and</v>
<v Speaker 6>tradition and even language to a certain</v>

3158
02:29:36.171 --> 02:29:39.080
<v Speaker 6>extent.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The thoughts stop being like you're</v>

3159
02:29:39.081 --> 02:29:43.100
<v Speaker 6>relaying things in your head in</v>
<v Speaker 6>sentences and paragraphs.</v>

3160
02:29:43.101 --> 02:29:45.590
<v Speaker 6>It,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it becomes concepts and ideas that are</v>

3161
02:29:45.591 --> 02:29:48.890
<v Speaker 6>almost alien to language gets very</v>
<v Speaker 6>weird.</v>

3162
02:29:48.980 --> 02:29:50.750
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Especially when you're on edibles.</v>

3163
02:29:51.100 --> 02:29:52.610
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can only imagine.</v>

3164
02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:55.400
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you do it more often?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you do it more often?</v>

3165
02:29:55.430 --> 02:29:57.650
<v Speaker 1>Because my tank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my zen tank,</v>

3166
02:29:57.710 --> 02:30:01.280
<v Speaker 1>we moved and I put it in the garage and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just haven't set it up.</v>

3167
02:30:01.790 --> 02:30:03.410
<v Speaker 1>That's all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to clean the garage out.</v>

3168
02:30:03.411 --> 02:30:05.210
<v Speaker 1>I gotta order more salt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all my fault.</v>

3169
02:30:05.211 --> 02:30:07.520
<v Speaker 1>I loved that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was so nice.</v>

3170
02:30:07.760 --> 02:30:09.920
<v Speaker 1>I was so nice going in there after a</v>
<v Speaker 1>workout,</v>

3171
02:30:09.921 --> 02:30:13.490
<v Speaker 1>just going in and just went on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Understand that you don't have it fading</v>

3172
02:30:13.491 --> 02:30:15.740
<v Speaker 1>and I got to get it set up again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just have to set it up.</v>

3173
02:30:15.770 --> 02:30:17.570
<v Speaker 1>I've got to call someone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have to do it yourself?</v>

3174
02:30:17.630 --> 02:30:18.411
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

3175
02:30:18.411 --> 02:30:20.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can to call those zen people.</v>

3176
02:30:20.160 --> 02:30:21.320
<v Speaker 1>Go Yo Hook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3177
02:30:21.321 --> 02:30:23.150
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's going to be in town to do</v>

3178
02:30:23.151 --> 02:30:25.100
<v Speaker 1>another podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna get you to help me set it up</v>

3179
02:30:25.101 --> 02:30:25.934
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

3180
02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:27.950
<v Speaker 1>But it's not that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's that is part of it.</v>

3181
02:30:27.951 --> 02:30:31.700
<v Speaker 1>But the other part of it is I've got a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking shit ton of quarter.</v>

3182
02:30:31.760 --> 02:30:34.010
<v Speaker 1>Like I have a hoarder problem in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>garage.</v>

3183
02:30:34.011 --> 02:30:35.810
<v Speaker 1>And do you think your office is bad?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man?</v>

3184
02:30:36.230 --> 02:30:39.140
<v Speaker 1>My garage looks there could be a dead</v>
<v Speaker 1>animal in that.</v>

3185
02:30:39.150 --> 02:30:42.200
<v Speaker 1>Like I've got so much shit piled up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to clean it out.</v>

3186
02:30:42.370 --> 02:30:44.270
<v Speaker 1>And if I just did that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have a float tank.</v>

3187
02:30:44.271 --> 02:30:48.710
<v Speaker 1>But also the other cool thing is I live</v>
<v Speaker 1>right down the street from just float.</v>

3188
02:30:48.900 --> 02:30:51.920
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can go down there and Jim has been</v>

3189
02:30:51.921 --> 02:30:53.840
<v Speaker 1>really cool and letting me like float</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

3190
02:30:53.841 --> 02:30:55.480
<v Speaker 1>So it's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>

3191
02:30:55.520 --> 02:30:56.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh that's nice.</v>

3192
02:30:56.830 --> 02:30:59.780
<v Speaker 1>It's so luxurious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those voices are booming now.</v>

3193
02:30:59.900 --> 02:31:01.910
<v Speaker 1>They're booming solo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so cool.</v>

3194
02:31:01.911 --> 02:31:03.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they should be man,</v>

3195
02:31:03.081 --> 02:31:03.950
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this,</v>

3196
02:31:03.951 --> 02:31:06.680
<v Speaker 1>this place you're talking about man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3197
02:31:07.100 --> 02:31:10.910
<v Speaker 1>the place that you're accessing through</v>
<v Speaker 1>the float tank and not always,</v>

3198
02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:12.830
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes I just go float.</v>

3199
02:31:13.160 --> 02:31:15.980
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea is you're always there.</v>

3200
02:31:16.010 --> 02:31:18.920
<v Speaker 1>You're there right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that place you're talking about,</v>

3201
02:31:18.921 --> 02:31:21.870
<v Speaker 1>you're there right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just that your attention has been</v>

3202
02:31:21.871 --> 02:31:25.650
<v Speaker 1>consumed by all the phenomena that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>swirling around you at this moment</v>

3203
02:31:25.651 --> 02:31:30.651
<v Speaker 1>called your podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're there right now and that the,</v>

3204
02:31:30.820 --> 02:31:34.830
<v Speaker 1>the practice of mindfulness and whatever</v>
<v Speaker 1>way you can practice mindfulness in a</v>

3205
02:31:34.831 --> 02:31:38.670
<v Speaker 1>float tank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zendo in your car,</v>

3206
02:31:38.700 --> 02:31:42.150
<v Speaker 1>wherever you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the practice of mindfulness is helping</v>

3207
02:31:42.151 --> 02:31:46.200
<v Speaker 1>you at least maybe not shoot out of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>gravity of the planet,</v>

3208
02:31:46.201 --> 02:31:49.560
<v Speaker 1>of your personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at least like get into the air a</v>

3209
02:31:49.561 --> 02:31:52.530
<v Speaker 1>little bit instead of getting cause this</v>
<v Speaker 1>land of what does it,</v>

3210
02:31:52.531 --> 02:31:54.540
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trouble in the land of trouble and</v>

3211
02:31:54.541 --> 02:31:57.360
<v Speaker 1>despair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is like the discursive mind,</v>

3212
02:31:57.361 --> 02:31:58.740
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is like a,</v>

3213
02:31:59.250 --> 02:32:00.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3214
02:32:00.461 --> 02:32:04.230
<v Speaker 1>the idea that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are two arrows strikes,</v>

3215
02:32:04.231 --> 02:32:04.470
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3216
02:32:04.470 --> 02:32:06.690
<v Speaker 1>So in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in every single given moment,</v>

3217
02:32:06.720 --> 02:32:08.490
<v Speaker 1>there are all these phenomena that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>

3218
02:32:08.520 --> 02:32:11.880
<v Speaker 1>Some of the phenomena,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't notice some of the phenomena</v>

3219
02:32:11.900 --> 02:32:13.980
<v Speaker 1>you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's two Arrow strikes.</v>

3220
02:32:13.981 --> 02:32:16.170
<v Speaker 1>One of them is the initial one that</v>
<v Speaker 1>bothers you.</v>

3221
02:32:16.171 --> 02:32:18.540
<v Speaker 1>Like somebody cuts you off in traffic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3222
02:32:18.720 --> 02:32:22.290
<v Speaker 1>So someone cuts you off in traffic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a classic example and you go,</v>

3223
02:32:22.291 --> 02:32:24.900
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck?</v>

3224
02:32:25.200 --> 02:32:27.300
<v Speaker 1>Jesus fucking Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was wrecked,</v>

3225
02:32:27.301 --> 02:32:30.390
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arrow strike the first air strike is the</v>

3226
02:32:30.391 --> 02:32:34.260
<v Speaker 1>guy cutting you off in traffic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second Arrow strike and the poison</v>

3227
02:32:34.261 --> 02:32:37.920
<v Speaker 1>arrow is everything that follows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you're in the land of trouble and</v>

3228
02:32:37.921 --> 02:32:39.870
<v Speaker 1>it's fair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now your mind has become this echo</v>

3229
02:32:39.871 --> 02:32:42.600
<v Speaker 1>chamber bouncing around with all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts of like,</v>

3230
02:32:42.601 --> 02:32:44.340
<v Speaker 1>God damn it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are fucking assholes.</v>

3231
02:32:44.341 --> 02:32:47.580
<v Speaker 1>No one cares about no though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's so fucking selfish.</v>

3232
02:32:47.760 --> 02:32:50.150
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that fucking asshole at work earlier</v>

3233
02:32:50.150 --> 02:32:50.150
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

3234
02:32:50.150 --> 02:32:51.140
<v Speaker 1>Suck man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3235
02:32:51.150 --> 02:32:52.800
<v Speaker 1>that's just salt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so now,</v>

3236
02:32:52.830 --> 02:32:54.900
<v Speaker 1>and that's called,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's called getting lost,</v>

3237
02:32:54.901 --> 02:32:56.160
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's called getting lost.</v>

3238
02:32:56.161 --> 02:32:58.980
<v Speaker 1>So flow tanks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meditation.</v>

3239
02:32:59.400 --> 02:33:03.480
<v Speaker 1>These are things where instead of</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting sucked in to the conversation,</v>

3240
02:33:03.481 --> 02:33:07.320
<v Speaker 1>like you were saying with the Ma many</v>
<v Speaker 1>entities that live in this land,</v>

3241
02:33:07.620 --> 02:33:12.180
<v Speaker 1>you just let that first thing hit you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been cut off in traffic and then it</v>

3242
02:33:12.181 --> 02:33:15.810
<v Speaker 1>goes away and there might be these</v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts flying around in your head</v>

3243
02:33:15.811 --> 02:33:16.710
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>

3244
02:33:16.711 --> 02:33:18.090
<v Speaker 1>what an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People suck.</v>

3245
02:33:18.390 --> 02:33:20.730
<v Speaker 1>But instead of you reacting to those</v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts,</v>

3246
02:33:20.731 --> 02:33:22.410
<v Speaker 1>you just watch them like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh wow,</v>

3247
02:33:22.680 --> 02:33:24.840
<v Speaker 1>that's the part of my brain that thinks</v>
<v Speaker 1>people suck.</v>

3248
02:33:25.260 --> 02:33:26.400
<v Speaker 1>Watch that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>

3249
02:33:26.401 --> 02:33:31.401
<v Speaker 1>there it is and now it's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that practice makes you a much</v>

3250
02:33:31.441 --> 02:33:35.850
<v Speaker 1>happier person over time and you realize</v>
<v Speaker 1>what conflicts are real and what</v>

3251
02:33:35.851 --> 02:33:38.280
<v Speaker 1>conflicts are just artificial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which ones you've made up,</v>

3252
02:33:38.281 --> 02:33:41.100
<v Speaker 1>which ones you've just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you've endorsed,</v>

3253
02:33:41.370 --> 02:33:44.550
<v Speaker 1>you've given them license to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to participate in your emotions,</v>

3254
02:33:44.551 --> 02:33:46.320
<v Speaker 1>but they really don't exist at all.</v>

3255
02:33:46.380 --> 02:33:48.810
<v Speaker 1>The nonsense nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone cutting you off with nothing</v>

3256
02:33:48.811 --> 02:33:50.340
<v Speaker 1>even happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You didn't get in an accident?</v>

3257
02:33:50.341 --> 02:33:50.911
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3258
02:33:50.911 --> 02:33:53.370
<v Speaker 1>so you ran into an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to Earth.</v>

3259
02:33:53.520 --> 02:33:54.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of them.</v>

3260
02:33:54.690 --> 02:33:55.860
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And guaranteed.</v>

3261
02:33:55.861 --> 02:33:57.480
<v Speaker 1>He didn't mean to like he did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3262
02:33:57.490 --> 02:33:59.040
<v Speaker 1>once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once man,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I was like trying to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3264
02:34:00.421 --> 02:34:03.900
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was late to get radiation therapy.</v>

3265
02:34:04.260 --> 02:34:04.940
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

3266
02:34:04.940 --> 02:34:09.940
<v Speaker 1>I cut somebody off in traffic cause I</v>
<v Speaker 1>had to go get my fucking body radiated</v>

3267
02:34:10.021 --> 02:34:11.970
<v Speaker 1>at a God damn radiation clinic and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3268
02:34:11.971 --> 02:34:15.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm sick and I cut some off in traffic</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I remember they're like,</v>

3269
02:34:15.181 --> 02:34:17.840
<v Speaker 1>fuck yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck yeah.</v>

3270
02:34:17.841 --> 02:34:18.060
<v Speaker 1>Or</v>

3271
02:34:18.060 --> 02:34:18.731
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

3272
02:34:18.731 --> 02:34:20.380
<v Speaker 3>I've got cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>

3273
02:34:20.381 --> 02:34:23.260
<v Speaker 3>I'm getting fried down in this clinic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trust me.</v>

3274
02:34:23.261 --> 02:34:24.130
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

3275
02:34:24.160 --> 02:34:27.040
<v Speaker 3>but now when any wood cuts me off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>usually I just think,</v>

3276
02:34:27.100 --> 02:34:29.260
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet that guy's going to get radiation</v>

3277
02:34:29.261 --> 02:34:30.190
<v Speaker 3>therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3278
02:34:30.520 --> 02:34:33.850
<v Speaker 3>Let's give him a fucking break today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't know where he's going.</v>

3279
02:34:34.060 --> 02:34:35.800
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she might just be getting back from an</v>

3280
02:34:35.801 --> 02:34:38.380
<v Speaker 3>abortion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you don't understand what's</v>

3281
02:34:38.381 --> 02:34:41.410
<v Speaker 3>actually happening there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so if you let your mind trick you,</v>

3282
02:34:41.620 --> 02:34:43.450
<v Speaker 3>then you'll get lost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's the,</v>

3283
02:34:43.480 --> 02:34:46.750
<v Speaker 3>that's the problem is it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not the screaming after the guy</v>

3284
02:34:46.751 --> 02:34:49.270
<v Speaker 3>cuts you off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's when you realize that for the last</v>

3285
02:34:49.271 --> 02:34:52.150
<v Speaker 3>six years you've been reacting to</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody,</v>

3286
02:34:52.151 --> 02:34:55.660
<v Speaker 3>cutting you off in traffic and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody you did some shitty thing to</v>

3287
02:34:55.661 --> 02:34:58.840
<v Speaker 3>you six years ago and you're still in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fucking car,</v>

3288
02:34:58.990 --> 02:35:00.490
<v Speaker 3>you're still banging the seat.</v>

3289
02:35:00.670 --> 02:35:02.320
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how frustrating is it when you're dating</v>

3290
02:35:02.321 --> 02:35:05.140
<v Speaker 3>someone and they bring up some shit that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you argued with them about six months</v>

3291
02:35:05.141 --> 02:35:08.350
<v Speaker 3>ago and the worst,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the worst,</v>

3292
02:35:08.380 --> 02:35:09.310
<v Speaker 3>the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Summoning up,</v>

3293
02:35:09.490 --> 02:35:13.090
<v Speaker 3>summoning up this demon from the past</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then like puppeteering it,</v>

3294
02:35:13.390 --> 02:35:15.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like remember this Diarra member?</v>

<v Speaker 3>you did that and you could be talking</v>

3296
02:35:18.881 --> 02:35:21.790
<v Speaker 3>about something that happened right now</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Jesus Christ.</v>

3297
02:35:21.791 --> 02:35:23.440
<v Speaker 3>Did you leave the refrigerator door</v>
<v Speaker 3>open?</v>

3298

<v Speaker 3>What happened there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

3302
02:35:32.890 --> 02:35:34.660
<v Speaker 3>I just asked you if you'd like to</v>
<v Speaker 3>refrigerator to open.</v>

<v Speaker 3>bitch lives in your brain because your</v>

3306
02:35:41.381 --> 02:35:43.630
<v Speaker 3>brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your brain is always bringing that shit</v>

<v Speaker 3>She sat next to you.</v>

3309
02:35:46.090 --> 02:35:50.500
<v Speaker 3>You don't need to</v>
<v Speaker 3>start with the crazy girlfriend living</v>

3310
02:35:50.501 --> 02:35:53.860
<v Speaker 3>in your consciousness because that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that's the one that's causing you</v>

3311
02:35:53.861 --> 02:35:55.690
<v Speaker 3>all the problems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If but what if you live in when the</v>

<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so this is like a,</v>

3314
02:36:01.210 --> 02:36:04.360
<v Speaker 3>I think a problem many people have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>deal with man,</v>

3315
02:36:04.361 --> 02:36:07.570
<v Speaker 3>which is like all right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of times you hear it like my</v>

3316
02:36:07.571 --> 02:36:10.030
<v Speaker 3>fucking parents are fucking out of their</v>
<v Speaker 3>mind,</v>

3317
02:36:10.031 --> 02:36:12.070
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you want to like change your</v>

3318
02:36:12.071 --> 02:36:14.890
<v Speaker 3>parents or you want to change the person</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're living.</v>

3319
02:36:14.891 --> 02:36:18.190
<v Speaker 3>Where do you want to change your kids</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a man?</v>

3320
02:36:18.191 --> 02:36:20.290
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you if you really look at</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3321
02:36:20.800 --> 02:36:23.330
<v Speaker 3>I really like that a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've talked about it before.</v>

3322
02:36:23.331 --> 02:36:27.110
<v Speaker 3>If I really liked that Clint Eastwood</v>
<v Speaker 3>movie play misty for me it's like this</v>

3323
02:36:27.111 --> 02:36:27.940
<v Speaker 3>all you can get on.</v>

3324
02:36:27.940 --> 02:36:32.940
<v Speaker 3>I think on itunes it's really good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this guy ends up fucking a fan and</v>

3325
02:36:33.791 --> 02:36:35.570
<v Speaker 3>the fan ends up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3326
02:36:35.890 --> 02:36:40.120
<v Speaker 3>stalking him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you realize that he was playing the</v>

3327
02:36:40.121 --> 02:36:43.300
<v Speaker 3>game with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with this girl that he had fucked.</v>

3328
02:36:43.301 --> 02:36:47.500
<v Speaker 3>Like he was letting her in every single</v>
<v Speaker 3>time he was giving her a little bit of</v>

3329
02:36:47.501 --> 02:36:49.120
<v Speaker 3>something to move on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3330
02:36:49.121 --> 02:36:54.121
<v Speaker 3>And like if you're living with a crazy</v>
<v Speaker 3>person and you really analyze the game,</v>

3331
02:36:54.570 --> 02:36:58.150
<v Speaker 3>there are some rules of the game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you a few right away.</v>

3332
02:36:58.180 --> 02:37:01.180
<v Speaker 3>Number one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need a crazy person.</v>

3333
02:37:01.210 --> 02:37:04.030
<v Speaker 3>That's the first one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you decide this is a crazy person,</v>

3334
02:37:04.031 --> 02:37:05.170
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's rule number one.</v>

3335
02:37:05.171 --> 02:37:07.000
<v Speaker 3>I'm living with a fucking crazy person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess.</v>

3336
02:37:07.300 --> 02:37:10.000
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well guess who's really fucking crazy?</v>

3337
02:37:10.150 --> 02:37:12.640
<v Speaker 3>The person who's decided to live with a</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy person.</v>

3338
02:37:12.820 --> 02:37:14.680
<v Speaker 3>So there's two crazy people in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>house.</v>

3339
02:37:14.710 --> 02:37:16.560
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people change</v>

3340
02:37:16.560 --> 02:37:20.390
<v Speaker 1>their behavior though for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then once you move in with them,</v>

3341
02:37:20.391 --> 02:37:24.110
<v Speaker 1>you realize how nutty they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless you're like super fucking</v>

3342
02:37:24.440 --> 02:37:29.120
<v Speaker 1>critical and objective and really</v>
<v Speaker 1>analyzing someone's behavior and you do</v>

3343
02:37:29.121 --> 02:37:30.650
<v Speaker 1>a background check.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3344
02:37:30.651 --> 02:37:34.100
<v Speaker 1>how many girls are room moved in with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy and they find out who was abusive</v>

3345
02:37:34.101 --> 02:37:36.170
<v Speaker 1>piece of shit once they got in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>

3346
02:37:36.200 --> 02:37:38.390
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many guys have been with a girl?</v>

3347
02:37:38.391 --> 02:37:41.240
<v Speaker 1>And then as the relationship goes on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they start to blame you for their</v>

3348
02:37:41.241 --> 02:37:45.650
<v Speaker 1>failures in life and you become the</v>
<v Speaker 1>magnifying glass of all their</v>

3349
02:37:46.250 --> 02:37:48.890
<v Speaker 1>personality and perfection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get the fuck out of there.</v>

3350
02:37:48.891 --> 02:37:51.290
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the only answer then.</v>

3351
02:37:51.291 --> 02:37:52.880
<v Speaker 1>But like if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

3352
02:37:52.881 --> 02:37:54.920
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times though,</v>

3353
02:37:54.921 --> 02:37:58.720
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times if you look at,</v>

3354
02:37:58.890 --> 02:38:00.440
<v Speaker 1>and I don't just mean living with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>girl,</v>

3355
02:38:00.441 --> 02:38:01.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean living with anyone.</v>

3356
02:38:01.670 --> 02:38:05.120
<v Speaker 1>But if you look or being at work with</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone or anyone you interact with on a</v>

3357
02:38:05.121 --> 02:38:05.901
<v Speaker 1>daily basis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

3358
02:38:05.901 --> 02:38:06.780
<v Speaker 1>you haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3359
02:38:07.010 --> 02:38:11.450
<v Speaker 1>some weird shit with right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next time you're interacting with</v>

3360
02:38:11.451 --> 02:38:13.700
<v Speaker 1>them in a bat to get in the old classic</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight,</v>

3361
02:38:13.880 --> 02:38:15.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just watch yourself.</v>

3362
02:38:15.680 --> 02:38:20.630
<v Speaker 1>Just watch yourself gear up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you will notice a lot of the time</v>

3363
02:38:20.960 --> 02:38:23.720
<v Speaker 1>that you're the one who's getting into</v>
<v Speaker 1>this shit,</v>

3364
02:38:23.840 --> 02:38:26.510
<v Speaker 1>that you're the ones you want it to</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

3365
02:38:26.840 --> 02:38:30.310
<v Speaker 1>You might notice a lot of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that this is always the,</v>

3366
02:38:30.311 --> 02:38:32.740
<v Speaker 1>this sounds super personal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why I,</v>

3367
02:38:33.020 --> 02:38:35.690
<v Speaker 1>well that's all I got is myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how the guys,</v>

3368
02:38:35.691 --> 02:38:37.790
<v Speaker 1>myself and this is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this is the,</v>

3369
02:38:37.791 --> 02:38:40.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the concept is Shempa I've talked to,</v>

3370
02:38:40.251 --> 02:38:41.570
<v Speaker 1>I think I've talked about in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast,</v>

3371
02:38:41.580 --> 02:38:43.910
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something Pema chodron talks about,</v>

3372
02:38:44.360 --> 02:38:46.910
<v Speaker 1>which is a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going back to archer again.</v>

3373
02:38:46.910 --> 02:38:51.500
<v Speaker 1>So shempa is the feeling of pulling back</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bowstring or the feeling of</v>

3374
02:38:51.501 --> 02:38:53.030
<v Speaker 1>preparing to strike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3375
02:38:53.031 --> 02:38:57.470
<v Speaker 1>So with mindfulness you start learning</v>
<v Speaker 1>about that feeling,</v>

3376
02:38:57.471 --> 02:38:59.870
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So someone starts pissing you off,</v>

3377
02:38:59.900 --> 02:39:03.260
<v Speaker 1>who start preparing for battle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You prepare for that and you realize</v>

3378
02:39:03.261 --> 02:39:04.370
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your insults,</v>

3379
02:39:04.610 --> 02:39:07.280
<v Speaker 1>you want to be right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've pulled back the bow and you want</v>

3380
02:39:07.281 --> 02:39:08.150
<v Speaker 1>to be right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>

3381
02:39:08.450 --> 02:39:10.670
<v Speaker 1>you want to put the fucking couch there</v>
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>

3382
02:39:10.850 --> 02:39:12.590
<v Speaker 1>Because I just don't think it belongs</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

3383
02:39:12.870 --> 02:39:14.840
<v Speaker 1>He want to put the fucking couch there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

3384
02:39:14.841 --> 02:39:18.290
<v Speaker 1>if you think about is there a right</v>
<v Speaker 1>place for the couch and the universe</v>

3385
02:39:18.320 --> 02:39:20.510
<v Speaker 1>that we were just talking about much?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't put the cows in front of the</v>

3386
02:39:20.511 --> 02:39:21.980
<v Speaker 1>fireplace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll catch on shore.</v>

3387
02:39:21.981 --> 02:39:25.400
<v Speaker 1>You're stupid foot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aesthetically we exist in a universe was</v>

3388
02:39:25.401 --> 02:39:30.230
<v Speaker 1>star clusters that are giving birth to</v>
<v Speaker 1>stars and you have decided this must be</v>

3389
02:39:30.231 --> 02:39:31.850
<v Speaker 1>the right place for the couch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3390
02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:35.120
<v Speaker 1>And that Shempa you're pulling it back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to fight this stupid fight</v>

3391
02:39:35.360 --> 02:39:36.860
<v Speaker 1>when instead you could be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

3392
02:39:37.250 --> 02:39:39.260

<v Speaker 1>that's a perfect place for the cat.</v>

3393
02:39:39.290 --> 02:39:42.320
<v Speaker 1>You know what happens when you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You end up with a fucking chick house</v>

3394
02:39:42.590 --> 02:39:45.590
<v Speaker 1>and they dominate the whole place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They start with a couch and then they</v>

3395
02:39:45.591 --> 02:39:49.770
<v Speaker 1>moved to the fucking sheets and next</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing you know your toothbrush,</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's slightly different than Chai.</v>

<v Speaker 1>We'll take chick houses different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll start,</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's like I'm fighting for my life.</v>

3414
02:40:43.590 --> 02:40:44.970
<v Speaker 1>So then you look at the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3415
02:40:44.971 --> 02:40:48.060

<v Speaker 1>Because the mind is telling you,</v>

3416
02:40:48.370 --> 02:40:50.910
<v Speaker 1>mother fucker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if this couch and stuff here,</v>

3417
02:40:51.240 --> 02:40:54.390
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be a matter of time before</v>
<v Speaker 1>she starts fucking a personal trainer</v>

3418
02:40:54.391 --> 02:40:54.991
<v Speaker 1>for a few.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3419
02:40:54.991 --> 02:40:58.200
<v Speaker 1>If she starts fucking her trainer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be wearing dresses.</v>

3420
02:40:58.410 --> 02:40:59.520
<v Speaker 1>You're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to end up,</v>

3421
02:40:59.550 --> 02:41:02.010
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna end up sucking or trainers</v>
<v Speaker 1>cock and you're going to meet a chick</v>

3422
02:41:02.011 --> 02:41:03.780
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the mind telling us what I'm</v>

3423
02:41:03.781 --> 02:41:04.591
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

3424
02:41:04.591 --> 02:41:06.900
<v Speaker 1>it's not real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not real.</v>

3425
02:41:06.901 --> 02:41:09.000
<v Speaker 1>It's not as slippery as a battle going</v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

3426
02:41:13.370 --> 02:41:16.080
<v Speaker 1>Try to lose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lose the battle.</v>

3427
02:41:16.500 --> 02:41:18.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have a mortgage,</v>

3428
02:41:19.110 --> 02:41:21.600
<v Speaker 1>don't lose the battle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't lose the battle over the mortgage.</v>

3429
02:41:21.601 --> 02:41:23.280
<v Speaker 1>Don't lose the battle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you know,</v>

3430
02:41:23.281 --> 02:41:25.890
<v Speaker 1>if she wants you to sign up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she doesn't want you to sign a prenup.</v>

3431
02:41:25.950 --> 02:41:27.240
<v Speaker 1>Don't lose the bag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3432
02:41:27.241 --> 02:41:29.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm not talking about those battles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm as a real man.</v>

3433
02:41:29.970 --> 02:41:31.580
<v Speaker 1>Those are real battles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm consequences.</v>

3434
02:41:31.581 --> 02:41:34.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most battles that you're fighting,</v>

3435
02:41:35.010 --> 02:41:37.230
<v Speaker 1>they don't have that much of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence,</v>

3436
02:41:37.231 --> 02:41:39.480
<v Speaker 1>and if you really want to talk about</v>
<v Speaker 1>losing the fucking battle,</v>

3437
02:41:39.720 --> 02:41:42.780
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not talking about rolling over</v>
<v Speaker 1>for your girlfriend or for your boss,</v>

3438
02:41:42.781 --> 02:41:47.250
<v Speaker 1>if for any of these people I'm talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about those little tiny conflicts you</v>

3439
02:41:47.251 --> 02:41:52.251
<v Speaker 1>create so that you can feel what it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to overpower someone in win in</v>

3440
02:41:52.501 --> 02:41:54.150
<v Speaker 1>every single moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the winning thing,</v>

3441
02:41:54.151 --> 02:41:54.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to win.</v>

3442
02:41:54.960 --> 02:41:57.330
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like the most toxic thing in a</v>

3443
02:41:57.331 --> 02:41:58.021
<v Speaker 1>relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3444
02:41:58.021 --> 02:41:59.880
<v Speaker 1>If you're with a girl and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it becomes,</v>

3445
02:42:00.300 --> 02:42:04.050
<v Speaker 1>there wasn't a billy Joel Song about</v>
<v Speaker 1>that matter of trust.</v>

3446
02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:07.380
<v Speaker 1>Just leave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just lose practice losing.</v>

3447
02:42:07.381 --> 02:42:11.000
<v Speaker 1>And I</v>
<v Speaker 1>live in with,</v>

3448
02:42:11.060 --> 02:42:12.450
<v Speaker 1>how about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing though,</v>

3449
02:42:13.140 --> 02:42:16.890
<v Speaker 1>I definitely believe that you're correct</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that you will attract the type of</v>

3450
02:42:16.891 --> 02:42:21.720
<v Speaker 1>people that you deserve in that sense</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you deserve with the way you</v>

3451
02:42:21.721 --> 02:42:23.520
<v Speaker 1>believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the way you could run it in nutty</v>

3452
02:42:23.521 --> 02:42:24.570
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can fuck up.</v>

3453
02:42:24.571 --> 02:42:26.880
<v Speaker 1>You could say he could as ag for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most part,</v>

3454
02:42:26.881 --> 02:42:30.090
<v Speaker 1>the people that you let in a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times they reflect where you</v>

3455
02:42:30.091 --> 02:42:33.960
<v Speaker 1>are as person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you find yourself involved in</v>

3456
02:42:33.961 --> 02:42:35.580
<v Speaker 1>these shitty relationships over and over</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

3457
02:42:35.581 --> 02:42:38.280
<v Speaker 1>you might want to look inward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might want to look at what you're</v>

3458
02:42:38.281 --> 02:42:41.310
<v Speaker 1>putting out there and what kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people you're letting in and what kind</v>

3459
02:42:41.311 --> 02:42:44.850
<v Speaker 1>of circles you're hanging around in and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what kind of interest you're pursuing,</v>

3460
02:42:45.120 --> 02:42:49.620
<v Speaker 1>what kind of things you focusing on and</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is that led you to be engulfed in</v>

3461
02:42:49.621 --> 02:42:50.640
<v Speaker 1>this world of stupid?</v>

3462
02:42:50.660 --> 02:42:51.201
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

3463
02:42:51.201 --> 02:42:52.690
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yeah,</v>

3464
02:42:52.780 --> 02:42:54.390
<v Speaker 1>and in the world of stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the era,</v>

3465
02:42:54.391 --> 02:42:57.360
<v Speaker 1>and it's like you're in the world of</v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid fine.</v>

3466
02:42:57.361 --> 02:42:59.010
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got into the world of stupid</v>

3467
02:42:59.011 --> 02:43:03.120
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But really if you start looking at like</v>

3468
02:43:03.450 --> 02:43:05.160
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they call it threading the necklace,</v>

3469
02:43:05.161 --> 02:43:06.810
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're threading the fucking necklace</v>

3470
02:43:07.050 --> 02:43:10.620
<v Speaker 1>every single moment you're threading,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this necklace is suffering.</v>

3471
02:43:10.621 --> 02:43:11.860
<v Speaker 1>So in every single moment</v>

3472
02:43:12.070 --> 02:43:15.310
<v Speaker 3>you're bringing into that moment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the past battles,</v>

3473
02:43:15.311 --> 02:43:17.860
<v Speaker 3>you lost,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the past battles you want,</v>

3474
02:43:17.861 --> 02:43:20.800
<v Speaker 3>all the compromises you made.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're bringing into that moment your</v>

3475
02:43:20.801 --> 02:43:24.520
<v Speaker 3>idea of here's what's right and here's</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's wrong.</v>

3476
02:43:24.760 --> 02:43:28.810
<v Speaker 3>And the question is how much of your</v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding of what's right and how</v>

3477
02:43:28.811 --> 02:43:32.680
<v Speaker 3>much of your understanding of what's</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong is based on reality and how much</v>

3478
02:43:32.681 --> 02:43:35.530
<v Speaker 3>of it is based on your own desire to</v>
<v Speaker 3>win,</v>

3479
02:43:35.531 --> 02:43:37.150
<v Speaker 3>to overcome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then again,</v>

3480
02:43:37.151 --> 02:43:37.780
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>

3481
02:43:37.780 --> 02:43:42.780
<v Speaker 3>I'm not advocating the concept of</v>
<v Speaker 3>becoming someone who's downtrodden and</v>

3482
02:43:42.941 --> 02:43:47.350
<v Speaker 3>some girl or boss or situation is like</v>
<v Speaker 3>clumping all over you.</v>

3483
02:43:47.550 --> 02:43:49.790
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you again,</v>

3484
02:43:49.820 --> 02:43:51.520
<v Speaker 3>a fight with my girlfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3485
02:43:51.760 --> 02:43:52.593
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>and I'm,</v>

3487
02:43:54.121 --> 02:43:56.320
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry,</v>

<v Speaker 3>original print of Bob Dylan.</v>

3492
02:44:07.990 --> 02:44:10.720
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like Bob Dylan.</v>

3493
02:44:12.070 --> 02:44:13.150

<v Speaker 3>don't you like him?</v>

3495
02:44:14.590 --> 02:44:15.790
<v Speaker 3>Because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he,</v>

3496
02:44:15.850 --> 02:44:17.140
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

3497
02:44:17.350 --> 02:44:20.480
<v Speaker 3>I saw an interview that he did when he</v>
<v Speaker 3>was like a super con.</v>

3498
02:44:20.500 --> 02:44:23.050
<v Speaker 3>This is before the Kanye thing happened</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

3499
02:44:23.051 --> 02:44:24.880
<v Speaker 3>now that I think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why don't I like Bob Dylan,</v>

3500
02:44:24.881 --> 02:44:27.640
<v Speaker 3>he's got a lot of great fucking songs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even though if he sat,</v>

3501
02:44:27.850 --> 02:44:31.060
<v Speaker 3>he sounds like a wallet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a leather wallet started singing or</v>

3502
02:44:31.061 --> 02:44:31.894
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

3503
02:44:32.020 --> 02:44:34.780
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why it annoys me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I like,</v>

3504
02:44:34.781 --> 02:44:37.480
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought there's no real basis of</v>

3505
02:44:37.481 --> 02:44:42.481
<v Speaker 3>liking and not liking</v>
<v Speaker 3>it anyway.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Maybe he's having a bad day.</v>

3519
02:45:08.230 --> 02:45:10.240
<v Speaker 3>People love Bob Dylan was when he was</v>
<v Speaker 3>young.</v>

<v Speaker 3>to listen to his music.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh No.</v>

3527
02:45:25.451 --> 02:45:27.970
<v Speaker 3>The watchtower.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's a basis.</v>

3528
02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:30.700
<v Speaker 3>Obviously I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's based in reality,</v>

3529
02:45:30.701 --> 02:45:32.410
<v Speaker 3>but so like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3530
02:45:32.411 --> 02:45:34.000
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want that picture up.</v>

3531
02:45:34.480 --> 02:45:36.600
<v Speaker 3>I don't want that picture of Bob Dylan</v>
<v Speaker 3>up in the guest.</v>

3532
02:45:36.640 --> 02:45:38.590
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want our guests to look at Bob</v>

3533
02:45:38.590 --> 02:45:40.480
<v Speaker 3>Dylan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm being a dick man and like you know</v>

3534
02:45:40.481 --> 02:45:42.190
<v Speaker 3>what she does man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>puts it up there.</v>

3535
02:45:42.191 --> 02:45:45.010
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she takes it down and then like I come</v>

3536
02:45:45.011 --> 02:45:49.000
<v Speaker 3>into the guestroom and she's taken a</v>
<v Speaker 3>picture of Bob Dylan down and I'm like,</v>

3537
02:45:49.001 --> 02:45:50.980
<v Speaker 3>you took the picture of Bob Dylan down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>

3538
02:45:51.760 --> 02:45:53.890
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess I'll just sell it on Ebay or</v>

3539
02:45:53.891 --> 02:45:57.550
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like in that moment I felt like the</v>

3540
02:45:57.551 --> 02:46:01.120
<v Speaker 3>biggest asshole ever live like God damn</v>
<v Speaker 3>it man.</v>

3541
02:46:01.300 --> 02:46:04.060
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to win this battle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to win,</v>

3542
02:46:04.080 --> 02:46:09.010
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to be the victor and I won.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What did I win a wall that doesn't have</v>

3543
02:46:09.020 --> 02:46:13.370
<v Speaker 3>Bob Dylan on it and like my girlfriend</v>
<v Speaker 3>like having like,</v>

3544
02:46:13.371 --> 02:46:16.520
<v Speaker 3>Oh I guess I'm just going to sell this</v>
<v Speaker 3>picture that I like cause my boyfriend's</v>

3545
02:46:16.521 --> 02:46:21.521
<v Speaker 3>a deck and it's like that's not winning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's losing like that's fundamentally</v>

3546
02:46:21.801 --> 02:46:26.480
<v Speaker 3>losing on every single level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I guess if she'd been like using the</v>

3547
02:46:26.481 --> 02:46:29.960
<v Speaker 3>picture of Bob Dylan and some kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>like method of torture,</v>

3548
02:46:29.961 --> 02:46:31.730
<v Speaker 3>like till when herself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's different.</v>

3549
02:46:31.731 --> 02:46:36.731
<v Speaker 3>But all I'm saying is a lot of times we</v>
<v Speaker 3>make decisions that we think are in our</v>

3550
02:46:37.311 --> 02:46:42.260
<v Speaker 3>own best interest when really there</v>
<v Speaker 3>because we want to feel like we have</v>

3551
02:46:42.261 --> 02:46:43.520
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we're right,</v>

3552
02:46:43.790 --> 02:46:47.600
<v Speaker 3>we want to be right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and sometimes you're not right because</v>

3553
02:46:47.601 --> 02:46:49.160
<v Speaker 3>there's no right or wrong answer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3554
02:46:49.300 --> 02:46:52.150
<v Speaker 6>Let's get back to the root of why.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What are you doing in the first place?</v>

3555
02:46:52.151 --> 02:46:54.610
<v Speaker 6>Like why are you seeking conflict like</v>
<v Speaker 6>this?</v>

3556
02:46:54.820 --> 02:46:57.910
<v Speaker 6>I think for a lot of people it's because</v>
<v Speaker 6>of what we were talking about earlier,</v>

3557
02:46:58.090 --> 02:47:02.500
<v Speaker 6>these primal needs that are not met,</v>
<v Speaker 6>these primal genetic needs and some of</v>

3558
02:47:02.501 --> 02:47:06.670
<v Speaker 6>those primal genetic needs or about</v>
<v Speaker 6>overcoming situations.</v>

3559
02:47:06.671 --> 02:47:08.220
<v Speaker 6>Overcoming adversity.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3560
02:47:08.290 --> 02:47:10.720
<v Speaker 6>There's reward systems built into our</v>
<v Speaker 6>brain.</v>

3561
02:47:10.840 --> 02:47:14.740
<v Speaker 6>That's why we give a fuck of a computer</v>
<v Speaker 6>beats us and go because we'd go is is a</v>

3562
02:47:14.741 --> 02:47:17.110
<v Speaker 6>test would test is something you tried</v>
<v Speaker 6>to overcome,</v>

3563
02:47:17.111 --> 02:47:18.400
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're trying to compete,</v>

3564
02:47:18.640 --> 02:47:20.440
<v Speaker 6>so this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this wanting to win with your</v>

3565
02:47:20.441 --> 02:47:22.690
<v Speaker 6>girlfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a manifestation of some shit that's</v>

3566
02:47:22.691 --> 02:47:26.920
<v Speaker 6>deep in our DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not just as simple as lose or just</v>

3567
02:47:26.921 --> 02:47:29.920
<v Speaker 6>let it happen.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's as simple as you have some</v>

3568
02:47:29.921 --> 02:47:32.770
<v Speaker 6>programming in your body that you need</v>
<v Speaker 6>to address with.</v>

3569
02:47:33.020 --> 02:47:33.853
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's,</v>

3570
02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:38.410
<v Speaker 6>there's certain activities that you can</v>
<v Speaker 6>pursue that can free you from all this</v>

3571
02:47:38.411 --> 02:47:39.390
<v Speaker 6>stupidity,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3572
02:47:39.430 --> 02:47:42.580
<v Speaker 6>It's tied up in you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and it doesn't have to be that you,</v>

3573
02:47:42.581 --> 02:47:44.380
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you just let it go and you just lose.</v>

3574
02:47:44.530 --> 02:47:45.311
<v Speaker 6>Like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's,</v>

3575
02:47:45.311 --> 02:47:48.490
<v Speaker 6>there's other methodologies,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's other ways to approach it.</v>

3576
02:47:48.491 --> 02:47:51.880
<v Speaker 6>And I think the holistic way is to do</v>
<v Speaker 6>the whole thing.</v>

3577
02:47:52.050 --> 02:47:54.670
<v Speaker 6>Let it be,</v>
<v Speaker 6>be aware of what the competition is,</v>

3578
02:47:54.671 --> 02:47:58.680
<v Speaker 6>but also drain your fucking body out of</v>
<v Speaker 6>all its excess energy because your body</v>

3579
02:47:58.681 --> 02:48:01.490
<v Speaker 6>is like an overflowing machine.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like a,</v>

3580
02:48:01.491 --> 02:48:02.290
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3581
02:48:02.290 --> 02:48:04.320
<v Speaker 6>an engine.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's too much gas pumping into,</v>

3582
02:48:04.350 --> 02:48:06.370
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like choking and spitting on its</v>

3583
02:48:06.371 --> 02:48:08.470
<v Speaker 6>own energy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't have an outlet.</v>

3584
02:48:08.620 --> 02:48:10.950
<v Speaker 6>You're in a fucking car all day.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're drinking coffee all day,</v>

3585
02:48:10.951 --> 02:48:13.240
<v Speaker 6>or you're in a car in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're drinking coffee all day.</v>

3586
02:48:13.241 --> 02:48:14.170
<v Speaker 6>You're stuck in a box.</v>

3587
02:48:14.170 --> 02:48:15.820
<v Speaker 6>You're sitting down,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you get up,</v>

3588
02:48:15.821 --> 02:48:17.170
<v Speaker 6>your back hurts,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you piss,</v>

3589
02:48:17.171 --> 02:48:19.780
<v Speaker 6>you fucking go back to work again.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're barely moving.</v>

3590
02:48:19.990 --> 02:48:23.170
<v Speaker 6>You're barely moving and your body's</v>
<v Speaker 6>designed to run from cats.</v>

3591
02:48:23.410 --> 02:48:27.560
<v Speaker 6>Your body's designed to fucking build a</v>
<v Speaker 6>house because intruders or common it,</v>

3592
02:48:27.610 --> 02:48:31.330
<v Speaker 6>none of these needs are being met.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The needs of gathering up your own food.</v>

3593
02:48:31.480 --> 02:48:34.600
<v Speaker 6>That's why there's that primal,</v>
<v Speaker 6>crazy feeling when you catch a fish.</v>

3594
02:48:34.900 --> 02:48:38.530
<v Speaker 6>That feeling when you got to fish,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when you bring a holy Shit,</v>

3595
02:48:38.840 --> 02:48:40.750
<v Speaker 6>you could go to a store,</v>
<v Speaker 6>buy a fish.</v>

3596
02:48:41.140 --> 02:48:42.990
<v Speaker 6>It takes five seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3597
02:48:43.020 --> 02:48:44.380
<v Speaker 6>walk up to the counter.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3598
02:48:44.381 --> 02:48:46.360
<v Speaker 6>give me one of those trout.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They prep it up.</v>

3599
02:48:46.390 --> 02:48:47.710
<v Speaker 6>They give it to you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're done,</v>

3600
02:48:47.980 --> 02:48:49.900
<v Speaker 6>but not does it feel like anything?</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's right.</v>

3601
02:48:49.960 --> 02:48:51.360
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't feel,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3602
02:48:51.400 --> 02:48:55.240
<v Speaker 6>imagine if it felt that good to buy a</v>
<v Speaker 6>fish and when you bought a fish,</v>

3603
02:48:55.300 --> 02:48:56.710
<v Speaker 6>be like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

3604
02:48:56.711 --> 02:48:59.050
<v Speaker 6>look at the size of his trout.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

3605
02:48:59.860 --> 02:49:02.410
<v Speaker 6>Did you buy this?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fish is amazing.</v>

3606
02:49:02.411 --> 02:49:06.010
<v Speaker 6>Where did you buy pictures of</v>
<v Speaker 6>everybody's instagram would be pictures</v>

3607
02:49:06.011 --> 02:49:06.880
<v Speaker 6>of the fish.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They just,</v>

3608
02:49:08.940 --> 02:49:10.620
<v Speaker 1>if you show a picture of fish on</v>
<v Speaker 1>instagram,</v>

3609
02:49:10.621 --> 02:49:13.440
<v Speaker 1>you'd better be cooking that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You better be explaining some delicious</v>

3610
02:49:13.920 --> 02:49:16.140
<v Speaker 1>thing you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you could catch a fish.</v>

3611
02:49:16.141 --> 02:49:17.220
<v Speaker 1>You take a picture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody goes,</v>

3612
02:49:17.250 --> 02:49:18.720
<v Speaker 1>aw man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nice Bass.</v>

3613
02:49:18.790 --> 02:49:19.640
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

3614
02:49:20.500 --> 02:49:21.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3615
02:49:21.620 --> 02:49:23.460
<v Speaker 1>This is a primal thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

3616
02:49:23.520 --> 02:49:26.180
<v Speaker 1>And that primal things attached to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoot and I was fucking arrows,</v>

3617
02:49:26.290 --> 02:49:27.750
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make no mistake about it.</v>

3618
02:49:27.751 --> 02:49:30.060
<v Speaker 1>They used to be an effective tool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>

3619
02:49:30.090 --> 02:49:33.240
<v Speaker 1>The more you do stuff like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last you're going to fight over</v>

3620
02:49:33.241 --> 02:49:35.880
<v Speaker 1>fucking Bob Dylan pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guaranteed.</v>

3621
02:49:35.881 --> 02:49:38.520
<v Speaker 1>At least have to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just got to train the body,</v>

3622
02:49:39.060 --> 02:49:41.430
<v Speaker 1>make the body fucking move,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make it move,</v>

3623
02:49:41.580 --> 02:49:43.530
<v Speaker 1>get all that excess pull shit out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

3624
02:49:43.610 --> 02:49:44.301
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

3625
02:49:44.301 --> 02:49:46.010
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

3626
02:49:46.060 --> 02:49:46.980
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3627
02:49:47.250 --> 02:49:50.220
<v Speaker 1>you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's exercise is certainly one big part</v>

3628
02:49:50.221 --> 02:49:50.671
<v Speaker 1>of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3629
02:49:50.671 --> 02:49:52.210
<v Speaker 1>But there's La,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all,</v>

3630
02:49:52.240 --> 02:49:53.740
<v Speaker 1>they're all connected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all connect.</v>

3631
02:49:53.740 --> 02:49:57.070
<v Speaker 1>There is no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no one thing that you,</v>

3632
02:49:57.090 --> 02:49:58.860
<v Speaker 1>you don't need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that whole puzzle,</v>

3633
02:49:59.040 --> 02:50:02.880
<v Speaker 1>the main,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the main thing that you teach is</v>

3634
02:50:02.881 --> 02:50:07.881
<v Speaker 1>that you don't have to be trapped and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gravitational field of whatever the</v>

3635
02:50:08.581 --> 02:50:11.040
<v Speaker 1>particular wife is that you happen to</v>
<v Speaker 1>find yourself.</v>

3636
02:50:11.041 --> 02:50:13.770
<v Speaker 1>And if you find yourself in a life that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't like,</v>

3637
02:50:14.040 --> 02:50:19.040
<v Speaker 1>if you find yourself in a situation that</v>
<v Speaker 1>is not bringing you happiness,</v>

3638
02:50:19.350 --> 02:50:24.350
<v Speaker 1>then there are ways that you can escape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That gravitational field takes work and</v>

3639
02:50:24.840 --> 02:50:26.400
<v Speaker 1>it takes time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes a lot of momentum.</v>

3640
02:50:26.401 --> 02:50:27.900
<v Speaker 1>It takes time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a big one.</v>

3641
02:50:27.901 --> 02:50:31.440
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of people quit before they get</v>
<v Speaker 1>through their saw.</v>

3642
02:50:31.441 --> 02:50:34.920
<v Speaker 1>Crazy statistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A not a statistic or they're a meme that</v>

3643
02:50:34.921 --> 02:50:39.390
<v Speaker 1>is probably pretty accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It said 97% of the people work for the</v>

3644
02:50:39.391 --> 02:50:42.090
<v Speaker 1>3% of the people that didn't quit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

3645
02:50:42.420 --> 02:50:43.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty good man.</v>

3646
02:50:44.120 --> 02:50:44.700
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

3647
02:50:44.700 --> 02:50:46.860
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole quitting thing failing.</v>

3648
02:50:47.130 --> 02:50:49.470
<v Speaker 1>That's good too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can feel learn from them.</v>

3649
02:50:49.500 --> 02:50:50.191
<v Speaker 1>You learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3650
02:50:50.191 --> 02:50:53.700
<v Speaker 1>The negative and positive feedback are</v>
<v Speaker 1>all important in the loop.</v>

3651
02:50:53.790 --> 02:50:54.740
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3652
02:50:54.750 --> 02:50:59.250
<v Speaker 1>the mind will tell you after you failed</v>
<v Speaker 1>a certain number of times that you will</v>

3653
02:50:59.251 --> 02:51:00.480
<v Speaker 1>never be able to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3654
02:51:00.481 --> 02:51:02.610
<v Speaker 1>that's part of the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the other trick of the mind.</v>

3655
02:51:02.611 --> 02:51:03.410
<v Speaker 1>The mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's two,</v>

3656
02:51:03.410 --> 02:51:04.740
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of tricks than mine.</v>

3657
02:51:04.741 --> 02:51:07.710
<v Speaker 1>As one of the tricks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The mind tells you this is the main</v>

3658
02:51:07.711 --> 02:51:11.700
<v Speaker 1>source of suffering for a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that however you're feeling right now</v>

3659
02:51:11.730 --> 02:51:16.230
<v Speaker 1>is permanent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's not the number one like bad</v>

3660
02:51:16.231 --> 02:51:17.940
<v Speaker 1>trip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one big source of it.</v>

3661
02:51:17.941 --> 02:51:21.300
<v Speaker 1>You want to have a bad trip on acid when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in our three,</v>

3662
02:51:21.690 --> 02:51:24.060
<v Speaker 1>let your mind start telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be like this forever.</v>

3663
02:51:24.270 --> 02:51:25.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be like this forever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3664
02:51:25.351 --> 02:51:27.120
<v Speaker 1>This is never going away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three hours.</v>

3665
02:51:27.121 --> 02:51:29.520
<v Speaker 1>I know this is never going to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's near it and you will free.</v>

3666
02:51:29.550 --> 02:51:31.800
<v Speaker 1>You will freak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You will freak out if you think you're</v>

3667
02:51:31.801 --> 02:51:33.150
<v Speaker 1>going to trip for infinity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3668
02:51:33.480 --> 02:51:37.830
<v Speaker 1>So in the same way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most suffering comes because people</v>

3669
02:51:37.831 --> 02:51:39.240
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh shit man,</v>

3670
02:51:39.630 --> 02:51:42.540
<v Speaker 1>this situation I'm in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to always going to be like this.</v>

3671
02:51:42.541 --> 02:51:44.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm always going to be fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm always going to have a shitty job</v>

3672
02:51:44.801 --> 02:51:46.770
<v Speaker 1>and always going to be broke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm always going to be sad.</v>

3673
02:51:46.771 --> 02:51:49.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm never going to get out of this hole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a lie.</v>

3674
02:51:49.770 --> 02:51:51.570
<v Speaker 1>That's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at your life,</v>

3675
02:51:51.571 --> 02:51:55.260
<v Speaker 1>you've always experienced a change in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your emotional state.</v>

3676
02:51:55.470 --> 02:51:59.130
<v Speaker 1>You've always experienced the change in</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally every single thing from your</v>

3677
02:51:59.131 --> 02:52:02.580
<v Speaker 1>body to your surroundings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do your jobs to your girlfriends,</v>

3678
02:52:02.880 --> 02:52:03.713
<v Speaker 1>boyfriends.</v>

3679
02:52:03.780 --> 02:52:07.630
<v Speaker 1>It all is in a constant of flux.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you realize that,</v>

3680
02:52:07.840 --> 02:52:11.500
<v Speaker 1>then you can let go of the panic that</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes when you start thinking like,</v>

3681
02:52:11.501 --> 02:52:13.060
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is going to be like this forever.</v>

3682
02:52:13.090 --> 02:52:13.923
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

3683
02:52:14.050 --> 02:52:16.120
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to change.</v>

3684
02:52:16.121 --> 02:52:20.710
<v Speaker 1>Your situation will change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And once you start understanding that,</v>

3685
02:52:20.890 --> 02:52:24.850
<v Speaker 1>then it gives you some room to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gives you some room to actually begin</v>

3686
02:52:24.851 --> 02:52:27.730
<v Speaker 1>to make shifts or to do experiments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3687
02:52:27.731 --> 02:52:29.440
<v Speaker 1>But the mind will tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3688
02:52:29.441 --> 02:52:31.090
<v Speaker 1>you have failed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

3689
02:52:31.091 --> 02:52:32.560
<v Speaker 1>you got fat again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got fucking,</v>

3690
02:52:32.590 --> 02:52:33.730
<v Speaker 1>I got fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I um,</v>

3691
02:52:34.240 --> 02:52:35.080
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got,</v>

3692
02:52:35.350 --> 02:52:40.350
<v Speaker 1>I was working out nonstop equinox.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got my body fat down to 16%,</v>

3693
02:52:41.861 --> 02:52:42.551
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>

3694
02:52:42.551 --> 02:52:43.780
<v Speaker 1>that's a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty good.</v>

3695
02:52:43.810 --> 02:52:45.940
<v Speaker 1>Cause I got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get fat and uh,</v>

3696
02:52:46.180 --> 02:52:48.940
<v Speaker 1>I swell up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I throw those fucking beers down,</v>

3697
02:52:48.941 --> 02:52:52.030
<v Speaker 1>the old tube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five slices of fucking bread,</v>

3698
02:52:52.031 --> 02:52:54.370
<v Speaker 1>a beer and I pumped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've get fat.</v>

3699
02:52:54.490 --> 02:52:57.940
<v Speaker 1>So then I went on tour and I got fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>fat again man.</v>

3700
02:52:58.120 --> 02:53:00.370
<v Speaker 1>And like literally fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>overweight.</v>

3701
02:53:00.371 --> 02:53:01.220
<v Speaker 1>Cause I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this might,</v>

3702
02:53:01.630 --> 02:53:04.600
<v Speaker 1>equinox doesn't let you pretend that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think I'm all right.</v>

3703
02:53:04.601 --> 02:53:06.130
<v Speaker 1>They measure your body fat and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3704
02:53:06.131 --> 02:53:08.600
<v Speaker 1>you're overweight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I fail.</v>

3705
02:53:08.620 --> 02:53:12.310
<v Speaker 1>What'd you get up to percentage?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say man,</v>

3706
02:53:12.790 --> 02:53:14.380
<v Speaker 1>I just got just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got,</v>

3707
02:53:14.410 --> 02:53:17.680
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you the percentage I got to by</v>
<v Speaker 1>describing the look of sadness and my</v>

3708
02:53:17.681 --> 02:53:18.401
<v Speaker 1>trainers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3709
02:53:18.401 --> 02:53:21.910
<v Speaker 1>when the fucking printer thing came out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a combination surprise.</v>

3710
02:53:21.950 --> 02:53:22.960
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

3711
02:53:23.320 --> 02:53:26.610
<v Speaker 1>that's how fat I got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm still a faryal but it's,</v>

3712
02:53:26.680 --> 02:53:29.440
<v Speaker 1>it's diminishing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been working out three times a</v>

3713
02:53:29.441 --> 02:53:31.690
<v Speaker 1>week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but God dammit I'm going to keep fucking</v>

3714
02:53:31.691 --> 02:53:35.500
<v Speaker 1>doing it is a matter of practice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get fat,</v>

3715
02:53:35.710 --> 02:53:38.140
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But every time we get fat I'm going to</v>

3716
02:53:38.141 --> 02:53:38.890
<v Speaker 1>fight against it.</v>

3717
02:53:38.890 --> 02:53:40.720
<v Speaker 1>Why you saying that you're going to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>fat?</v>

3718
02:53:41.020 --> 02:53:42.760
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying if I do again,</v>

3719
02:53:42.790 --> 02:53:44.740
<v Speaker 1>but why are you saying it that way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

3720
02:53:44.741 --> 02:53:45.690
<v Speaker 1>That's bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3721
02:53:45.760 --> 02:53:48.970
<v Speaker 1>it seems like you're giving yourself a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a loophole that's kind of fun to get fat</v>

3722
02:53:49.240 --> 02:53:50.710
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3723
02:53:50.711 --> 02:53:52.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the process of eating,</v>

3724
02:53:52.031 --> 02:53:53.800
<v Speaker 1>when you're there in the hall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's no fun.</v>

3725
02:53:53.801 --> 02:53:55.540
<v Speaker 1>But like in the process of shoving</v>
<v Speaker 1>pizzas,</v>

3726
02:53:55.541 --> 02:53:57.010
<v Speaker 1>dying your throat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody's like that.</v>

3727
02:53:57.170 --> 02:53:58.780
<v Speaker 1>Like if that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that wasn't fun,</v>

3728
02:53:58.781 --> 02:54:01.480
<v Speaker 1>then we'd have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very different,</v>

3729
02:54:01.720 --> 02:54:04.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very different shape of most</v>

3730
02:54:04.961 --> 02:54:06.700
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And listen to everything that you just</v>

3731
02:54:06.701 --> 02:54:07.410
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3732
02:54:07.410 --> 02:54:10.120
<v Speaker 6>But the way you thinking and hold on for</v>
<v Speaker 6>a second before you interject,</v>

3733
02:54:10.190 --> 02:54:13.360
<v Speaker 6>think about everything you're saying</v>
<v Speaker 6>about the way people think and about the</v>

3734
02:54:13.361 --> 02:54:17.710
<v Speaker 6>traps and the way you define your</v>
<v Speaker 6>patterns that you fall back into each</v>

3735
02:54:17.711 --> 02:54:21.760
<v Speaker 6>and every time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then think about the intense physical</v>

3736
02:54:21.761 --> 02:54:24.670
<v Speaker 6>health consequences that you have</v>
<v Speaker 6>intimately experienced.</v>

3737
02:54:24.671 --> 02:54:28.390
<v Speaker 6>And the fact that even though you've</v>
<v Speaker 6>gone through cancer,</v>

3738
02:54:28.490 --> 02:54:32.920
<v Speaker 6>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you still will make yourself a like a</v>

3739
02:54:32.921 --> 02:54:35.080
<v Speaker 6>path that you're definitely going to go</v>
<v Speaker 6>down.</v>

3740
02:54:35.081 --> 02:54:36.680
<v Speaker 6>Where are you going to abuse your body,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3741
02:54:36.820 --> 02:54:41.820
<v Speaker 6>It put yourself into a state of shock</v>
<v Speaker 6>and overweight and making sure that you,</v>

3742
02:54:42.111 --> 02:54:44.440
<v Speaker 6>your body is compromised pretty</v>
<v Speaker 6>significantly.</v>

3743
02:54:44.470 --> 02:54:45.071
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3744
02:54:45.071 --> 02:54:46.780
<v Speaker 6>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when you really fat like that,</v>

3745
02:54:46.960 --> 02:54:48.940
<v Speaker 6>you're pretty significantly compromised</v>
<v Speaker 6>telling anybody,</v>

3746
02:54:48.941 --> 02:54:51.520
<v Speaker 6>tell you any different.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All those people that like want to dance</v>

3747
02:54:51.521 --> 02:54:52.870
<v Speaker 6>around it and say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3748
02:54:52.871 --> 02:54:55.600
<v Speaker 6>I'm fat and I'm healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like that's not real.</v>

3749
02:54:55.720 --> 02:54:58.270
<v Speaker 6>It's not real.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You are not as healthy as you would be</v>

3750
02:54:58.271 --> 02:55:01.990
<v Speaker 6>if you're not fat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can be fairly robust and overweight,</v>

3751
02:55:02.200 --> 02:55:04.010
<v Speaker 6>but you are,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're</v>

3752
02:55:04.010 --> 02:55:05.900
<v Speaker 4>compromised.</v>

3753
02:55:05.901 --> 02:55:07.900
<v Speaker 4>functional,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're most certainly compromised,</v>

02:55:07.901 --> 02:55:09.680
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You were at your best when your optimal</v>

3755
02:55:09.920 --> 02:55:11.930

<v Speaker 4>not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not ridiculous.</v>

<v Speaker 4>You don't want to be shredded.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He want to be fairly healthy and you</v>

3759
02:55:18.411 --> 02:55:21.560

<v Speaker 4>diet and you want to keep your body away</v>

<v Speaker 4>from any bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3761

<v Speaker 4>fucking sugars and processed shit and</v>

3762
02:55:27.170 --> 02:55:29.630
<v Speaker 4>nitrates and all that fucking shit that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get from.</v>

<v Speaker 4>all that shit that tastes so Gloria's</v>

3765
02:55:38.990 --> 02:55:41.630
<v Speaker 4>going down is killing your body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's true,</v>

3766
02:55:41.631 --> 02:55:45.110
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So why after all that you just said,</v>

3767
02:55:45.530 --> 02:55:48.680
<v Speaker 4>would you give yourself that little,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the little loophole,</v>

3768
02:55:48.681 --> 02:55:49.680
<v Speaker 4>that little mouth pleasure.</v>

3769
02:55:50.200 --> 02:55:52.470
<v Speaker 4>You're right and know you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it isn't.</v>

3770
02:55:52.630 --> 02:55:53.600
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we'll say,</v>

3771
02:55:53.620 --> 02:55:54.350
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

3772
02:55:54.350 --> 02:55:56.450
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so like when we were talking about it</v>

3773
02:55:56.451 --> 02:55:58.340
<v Speaker 4>being intimate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like this is very intimate.</v>

3774
02:55:58.341 --> 02:56:00.590
<v Speaker 4>It's great your talk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're talking about you.</v>

3775
02:56:00.650 --> 02:56:01.310
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3776
02:56:01.310 --> 02:56:04.010
<v Speaker 4>You are talking about you and you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>defining this,</v>

3777
02:56:04.011 --> 02:56:07.730
<v Speaker 4>this struggle and balance and battle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then at the end of this</v>

3778
02:56:07.731 --> 02:56:09.360
<v Speaker 4>inspirational thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you give yourself a loop.</v>

3779
02:56:09.361 --> 02:56:11.090
<v Speaker 4>All this is what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get fat and then that,</v>

3780
02:56:11.091 --> 02:56:13.250
<v Speaker 4>but when I get fat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get healthy again.</v>

3781
02:56:13.251 --> 02:56:14.330
<v Speaker 4>Fucking right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>

3782
02:56:14.420 --> 02:56:15.021
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3783
02:56:15.021 --> 02:56:15.850
<v Speaker 4>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

3784
02:56:15.850 --> 02:56:18.110
<v Speaker 4>it's gotta be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think as I think about this,</v>

3785
02:56:18.111 --> 02:56:19.340
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do think about this,</v>

3786
02:56:19.400 --> 02:56:21.020
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So why do I do this?</v>

3787
02:56:21.050 --> 02:56:23.330
<v Speaker 4>This loop,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this clear loop in my life,</v>

3788
02:56:23.360 --> 02:56:26.000
<v Speaker 4>which I it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've gone through a few repetitions of</v>

3789
02:56:26.001 --> 02:56:28.760
<v Speaker 4>this where I'll get close to getting in</v>
<v Speaker 4>shape.</v>

3790
02:56:28.790 --> 02:56:30.890
<v Speaker 4>I won't be what I would consider in</v>
<v Speaker 4>shape.</v>

3791
02:56:30.891 --> 02:56:33.710
<v Speaker 4>I'll get close and then I'll fuck it all</v>
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>

3792
02:56:33.800 --> 02:56:37.430
<v Speaker 4>So why am I building this house of cards</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then knocking it down again?</v>

3793
02:56:37.520 --> 02:56:41.450
<v Speaker 4>And especially after having gotten sick,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why would I keep doing that?</v>

3794
02:56:41.470 --> 02:56:42.303
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

3795
02:56:42.410 --> 02:56:44.150
<v Speaker 4>So man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3796
02:56:44.360 --> 02:56:47.330
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would love to have like a quick answer</v>

3797
02:56:47.331 --> 02:56:50.420
<v Speaker 4>for that awesome question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I don't,</v>

3798
02:56:50.450 --> 02:56:51.380
<v Speaker 4>I mean I could like,</v>

3799
02:56:52.250 --> 02:56:52.590
<v Speaker 8>yeah,</v>

3800
02:56:52.590 --> 02:56:55.080
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could give some easy answer that like,</v>

3801
02:56:55.560 --> 02:56:57.960
<v Speaker 4>but it wouldn't be the right answer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really don't know.</v>

3802
02:56:57.990 --> 02:56:58.823
<v Speaker 4>You allow it.</v>

3803
02:57:02.380 --> 02:57:05.170
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's move it right now.</v>

3804
02:57:05.180 --> 02:57:06.520
<v Speaker 4>So it's what it all is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're right.</v>

3805
02:57:06.521 --> 02:57:07.550
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a victim,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

3806
02:57:07.990 --> 02:57:08.823
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

3807
02:57:09.240 --> 02:57:10.840
<v Speaker 4>there's a reason why you don't smoke</v>
<v Speaker 4>cigarettes,</v>

3808
02:57:11.500 --> 02:57:12.130
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3809
02:57:12.130 --> 02:57:14.590
<v Speaker 4>Cause you don't allow them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

3810
02:57:14.620 --> 02:57:16.720
<v Speaker 4>You allow all this other stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You say,</v>

3811
02:57:16.721 --> 02:57:18.490
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to eat shitty food,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to get fat.</v>

3812
02:57:18.491 --> 02:57:21.130
<v Speaker 4>I love throwing beard on my face and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you allow it,</v>

3813
02:57:21.400 --> 02:57:24.400
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you allow yourself some mouth</v>

3814
02:57:24.401 --> 02:57:26.530
<v Speaker 4>pleasure or some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3815
02:57:26.620 --> 02:57:30.340
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some alcohol in intoxication pleasure.</v>

3816
02:57:30.670 --> 02:57:32.240
<v Speaker 4>You'll allow yourself that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3817
02:57:32.350 --> 02:57:36.580
<v Speaker 4>And you suffer the health quants</v>
<v Speaker 4>consequences like readily you like you</v>

3818
02:57:36.581 --> 02:57:38.170
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's this part of the program.</v>

3819
02:57:38.410 --> 02:57:40.540
<v Speaker 4>The mouth pleasure is more important</v>
<v Speaker 4>than the health.</v>

3820
02:57:40.810 --> 02:57:42.100
<v Speaker 4>So you allow it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3821
02:57:42.160 --> 02:57:43.690
<v Speaker 4>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you don't allow other shit,</v>

3822
02:57:43.870 --> 02:57:45.040
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if somebody gave you a bottle</v>

3823
02:57:45.041 --> 02:57:46.840
<v Speaker 4>oxycontin's you wouldn't be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh no,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

3825
02:57:49.560 --> 02:57:50.393
<v Speaker 4>Allow it.</v>

3826
02:57:51.130 --> 02:57:51.490
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3827
02:57:51.490 --> 02:57:56.410
<v Speaker 4>Well I mean I'd probably take a couple.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You would too.</v>

3828
02:57:56.411 --> 02:57:57.920
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3829
02:57:59.140 --> 02:57:59.591
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

3831
02:58:00.291 --> 02:58:01.620
<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean allow it.</v>

3832
02:58:01.650 --> 02:58:02.010
<v Speaker 4>Sure,</v>

3833
02:58:02.010 --> 02:58:02.790
<v Speaker 6>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 6>sure.</v>

3834
02:58:02.790 --> 02:58:05.310
<v Speaker 6>I've gotten fat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've gotten pretty close to being fat.</v>

3835
02:58:05.330 --> 02:58:06.930
<v Speaker 6>Like for me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>for me,</v>

3836
02:58:06.931 --> 02:58:07.660
<v Speaker 6>I've gotten,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3837
02:58:07.660 --> 02:58:11.100
<v Speaker 6>I can think of that the heaviest I got,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was like two oh four or two oh five or</v>

3838
02:58:11.101 --> 02:58:14.850
<v Speaker 6>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's 10 15 pounds overweight.</v>

3839
02:58:14.851 --> 02:58:15.684
<v Speaker 6>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>for real.</v>

3840
02:58:15.750 --> 02:58:18.190
<v Speaker 6>Like I really shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like my face gets fat and good it,</v>

3841
02:58:18.820 --> 02:58:20.160
<v Speaker 6>I'll get it here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I get it.</v>

3842
02:58:20.161 --> 02:58:22.020
<v Speaker 6>Like down here,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I started to get a little bit of this</v>

3843
02:58:22.021 --> 02:58:23.640
<v Speaker 6>and I could see it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I could see it in my face,</v>

3844
02:58:23.790 --> 02:58:25.560
<v Speaker 6>I could see it in my sides,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

3845
02:58:26.070 --> 02:58:31.070
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but that was all because I didn't work</v>

3846
02:58:32.600 --> 02:58:35.640
<v Speaker 6>out hard enough in relationship to how</v>
<v Speaker 6>much collars I was consuming.</v>

3847
02:58:35.700 --> 02:58:37.140
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not that I ever stopped working</v>

3848
02:58:37.141 --> 02:58:38.700
<v Speaker 6>out,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I was eating too much.</v>

3849
02:58:38.730 --> 02:58:39.960
<v Speaker 6>I was eating too much for what I was</v>
<v Speaker 6>doing.</v>

3850
02:58:40.350 --> 02:58:42.390
<v Speaker 6>But I get to a point where I realize it</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then I go,</v>

3851
02:58:42.391 --> 02:58:43.560
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I see what we're doing here.</v>

3852
02:58:43.770 --> 02:58:46.620
<v Speaker 6>Don't get fat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Get like kind of close to fat.</v>

3853
02:58:46.770 --> 02:58:48.420
<v Speaker 6>Realize what you're doing and don't do</v>
<v Speaker 6>it again.</v>

3854
02:58:49.170 --> 02:58:51.180
<v Speaker 6>If you allow yourself to get too far</v>
<v Speaker 6>gone,</v>

3855
02:58:51.210 --> 02:58:54.080
<v Speaker 6>then you create this fucking gigantic</v>
<v Speaker 6>divid that you can't get out of it.</v>

3856
02:58:54.081 --> 02:58:55.210
<v Speaker 6>It's the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I get,</v>

3857
02:58:55.260 --> 02:58:58.110
<v Speaker 6>if I got the worst I got like when I</v>
<v Speaker 6>hurt my back,</v>

3858
02:58:58.350 --> 02:59:01.230
<v Speaker 6>it was also what was going on to cause.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So what couldn't work out as intensely</v>

3859
02:59:01.470 --> 02:59:04.260
<v Speaker 6>when I was about 10 pounds heavier than</v>
<v Speaker 6>I am now.</v>

3860
02:59:04.710 --> 02:59:09.710
<v Speaker 6>The worst that it got was all wrapped</v>
<v Speaker 6>around like feeling sorry because of an</v>

3861
02:59:11.011 --> 02:59:15.720
<v Speaker 6>injury not being as disciplined as I</v>
<v Speaker 6>could be and allowing myself the</v>

3862
02:59:15.721 --> 02:59:18.180
<v Speaker 6>indulgence,</v>
<v Speaker 6>figuring I'm going to make up for it</v>

3863
02:59:18.181 --> 02:59:22.290
<v Speaker 6>later so I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm guilty of the same sort of behavior</v>

3864
02:59:22.291 --> 02:59:25.890
<v Speaker 6>I'm making you aware of by just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not guilty of it right now.</v>

3865
02:59:26.130 --> 02:59:29.130
<v Speaker 6>Like right now I'm on the straight and</v>
<v Speaker 6>narrow and I'm pretty healthy about it</v>

3866
02:59:29.131 --> 02:59:33.960
<v Speaker 6>and I'm pretty decided that this is how</v>
<v Speaker 6>many eat from now on with rare</v>

3867
02:59:33.961 --> 02:59:38.220
<v Speaker 6>indulgences just from mouth play.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But I think that mouth pleasure can't be</v>

3868
02:59:38.221 --> 02:59:39.840
<v Speaker 6>the big one.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can't be,</v>

3869
02:59:39.870 --> 02:59:43.620
<v Speaker 6>it's just not good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now the big one should be health health</v>

3870
02:59:43.621 --> 02:59:46.440
<v Speaker 6>should be the big one.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Mouth pleasure should be the occasional</v>

3871
02:59:46.441 --> 02:59:49.350
<v Speaker 6>foray.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It can't be daily mouth pleasure.</v>

3872
02:59:49.660 --> 02:59:50.700
<v Speaker 6>God Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

3873
02:59:50.730 --> 02:59:54.240
<v Speaker 6>I'll tell you man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like when I'm like shoving some kind of</v>

3874
02:59:54.241 --> 02:59:57.870
<v Speaker 6>shitty food into my mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's like such a,</v>

3875
02:59:57.900 --> 03:00:02.370
<v Speaker 6>it's got such a strong gravity for me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like the moment I kick into that mode,</v>

3876
03:00:02.371 --> 03:00:04.320
<v Speaker 6>like when I'm not doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>God,</v>

3877
03:00:04.321 --> 03:00:05.730
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was so cool and I was training with</v>

3878
03:00:05.731 --> 03:00:08.250
<v Speaker 6>this guy for a while.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you start getting into that and to</v>

3879
03:00:08.251 --> 03:00:10.140
<v Speaker 6>health and like you start getting into</v>
<v Speaker 6>that place.</v>

3880
03:00:10.140 --> 03:00:14.640
<v Speaker 6>It's incredible and that stuff holds</v>
<v Speaker 6>less of a gravitational pull.</v>

3881
03:00:14.641 --> 03:00:17.450
<v Speaker 6>But man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I guess it's some form of addiction or</v>

3882
03:00:17.451 --> 03:00:20.070
<v Speaker 6>is 100% of form of addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's dopamine.</v>

3883
03:00:20.280 --> 03:00:22.920
<v Speaker 6>There was a whole article about it</v>
<v Speaker 6>recently and one of those scientific</v>

3884
03:00:22.921 --> 03:00:23.680
<v Speaker 6>American,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think,</v>

3885
03:00:23.680 --> 03:00:26.430
<v Speaker 6>or one of those science journals that</v>
<v Speaker 6>was,</v>

3886
03:00:26.431 --> 03:00:28.650
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>talking about why it's so difficult for</v>

3887
03:00:28.651 --> 03:00:32.340
<v Speaker 6>people to quit bad habits because you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>

3888
03:00:32.341 --> 03:00:34.200
<v Speaker 6>those bad habits,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>

3889
03:00:34.290 --> 03:00:38.670
<v Speaker 6>the trigger dopamine releases in your</v>
<v Speaker 6>mind when you remember how great it was</v>

3890
03:00:38.671 --> 03:00:40.380
<v Speaker 6>to eat those donuts.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fuck it.</v>

3891
03:00:40.381 --> 03:00:41.700
<v Speaker 6>Let's just do it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fuck it.</v>

3892
03:00:41.701 --> 03:00:43.560
<v Speaker 6>Let's just give it an to have that</v>
<v Speaker 6>burger and a beer.</v>

3893
03:00:43.590 --> 03:00:45.990
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is is glorious.</v>

3894
03:00:46.620 --> 03:00:51.620
<v Speaker 6>But the problem is in you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you allow those pathways to exist.</v>

3895
03:00:52.170 --> 03:00:53.760
<v Speaker 6>If it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you don't allow it,</v>

3896
03:00:53.940 --> 03:00:55.620
<v Speaker 6>if the cigarettes never get in your</v>
<v Speaker 6>body,</v>

3897
03:00:55.621 --> 03:00:58.950
<v Speaker 6>like I don't allow cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm pretty sure he gives you cancer.</v>

3898
03:00:59.110 --> 03:01:01.900
<v Speaker 6>I see people smoking cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know they get tired quicker.</v>

3899
03:01:02.080 --> 03:01:03.670
<v Speaker 6>I know it's terrible for you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3900
03:01:03.760 --> 03:01:06.130
<v Speaker 6>So I don't allow it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When I see people smoking cigarettes,</v>

3901
03:01:06.131 --> 03:01:06.511
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what?</v>

3902
03:01:06.511 --> 03:01:09.190
<v Speaker 6>And he allowed cigarettes into his life</v>
<v Speaker 6>and that's what you're doing,</v>

3903
03:01:09.310 --> 03:01:10.660
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like it's not that I couldn't get</v>

3904
03:01:10.661 --> 03:01:12.190
<v Speaker 6>addicted.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think we can all get addicted.</v>

3905
03:01:12.340 --> 03:01:15.490
<v Speaker 6>If I started smoking cigarettes and I</v>
<v Speaker 6>realize oh there's a cognitive benefit</v>

3906
03:01:15.670 --> 03:01:18.370
<v Speaker 6>to smoke it on these things,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm just going to puff on a couple of</v>

3907
03:01:18.370 --> 03:01:19.690
<v Speaker 6>day.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There'll be die head smoke,</v>

3908
03:01:19.810 --> 03:01:22.060
<v Speaker 6>maybe a half a pack if I'm stressed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

3909
03:01:22.090 --> 03:01:23.950
<v Speaker 6>Next thing you know I'm freaking out</v>
<v Speaker 6>because I can't get a pack of</v>

3910
03:01:23.951 --> 03:01:25.000
<v Speaker 6>cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why?</v>

3911
03:01:25.030 --> 03:01:29.170
<v Speaker 6>Cause I will allow this demon into my</v>
<v Speaker 6>life and I think the same exist with</v>

3912
03:01:29.171 --> 03:01:32.350
<v Speaker 6>processed sugar and getting off of sugar</v>
<v Speaker 6>for just a few days.</v>

3913
03:01:32.470 --> 03:01:34.630
<v Speaker 6>Just a few days,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is not that difficult to thing.</v>

3914
03:01:34.631 --> 03:01:38.470
<v Speaker 6>You just give yourself a pattern for</v>
<v Speaker 6>five days that you have to follow.</v>

3915
03:01:38.680 --> 03:01:41.170
<v Speaker 6>This is all I'm allowed to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is all just do it for five days.</v>

3916
03:01:41.500 --> 03:01:44.170
<v Speaker 6>You get headaches,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you realize how crazy it is.</v>

3917
03:01:44.171 --> 03:01:45.870
<v Speaker 6>Shitty headaches.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You start losing weight,</v>

3918
03:01:45.871 --> 03:01:47.500
<v Speaker 6>your,</v>
<v Speaker 6>your body starts looking different.</v>

3919
03:01:47.501 --> 03:01:50.530
<v Speaker 6>You start getting thinner,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you start being less inflamed.</v>

3920
03:01:50.650 --> 03:01:54.820
<v Speaker 6>Sugar is a fucking monster.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So they said may exist in the form of</v>

3921
03:01:54.821 --> 03:01:56.020
<v Speaker 6>alcohol to my friend.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

3922
03:01:56.021 --> 03:01:57.670
<v Speaker 6>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the same goddamn thing.</v>

3923
03:01:57.990 --> 03:02:00.840
<v Speaker 6>Pull the pull of alcohol is the same</v>
<v Speaker 6>sugar.</v>

3924
03:02:01.070 --> 03:02:03.640
<v Speaker 6>Same with sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's the same pool of the bread,</v>

3925
03:02:03.820 --> 03:02:07.540
<v Speaker 6>the same pool of the Pasta Pasta today.</v>
<v Speaker 6>To this day,</v>

3926
03:02:07.541 --> 03:02:10.690
<v Speaker 6>it drives me crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you had a bowl of linguine with clams</v>

3927
03:02:10.930 --> 03:02:11.700
<v Speaker 3>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

3928
03:02:11.700 --> 03:02:13.890
<v Speaker 3>aw,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at that.</v>

3929
03:02:14.170 --> 03:02:19.170
<v Speaker 3>Laureus just Mao health food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just bad health.</v>

3930
03:02:20.280 --> 03:02:21.870
<v Speaker 3>Just glue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

3931
03:02:21.871 --> 03:02:23.550
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Laurie is glue.</v>

3932
03:02:24.100 --> 03:02:25.530
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's called a watch yourself.</v>

3933
03:02:25.620 --> 03:02:29.610
<v Speaker 3>It's cool to watch yourself get sucked</v>
<v Speaker 3>into it and it is like,</v>

3934
03:02:29.611 --> 03:02:30.990
<v Speaker 3>you know the thing you're making me</v>
<v Speaker 3>realize.</v>

3935
03:02:30.991 --> 03:02:33.600
<v Speaker 3>It's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never thought of myself as a</v>

3936
03:02:33.601 --> 03:02:36.660
<v Speaker 3>victim,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but anytime you trick yourself into</v>

3937
03:02:36.661 --> 03:02:41.661
<v Speaker 3>thinking this is what I do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you have tricked yourself into</v>

3938
03:02:41.821 --> 03:02:44.610
<v Speaker 3>becoming a victim.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've decided you're a victim.</v>

3939
03:02:44.670 --> 03:02:45.750
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's more importantly,</v>

3940
03:02:45.751 --> 03:02:48.750
<v Speaker 3>it's contrary to the entire two hours</v>
<v Speaker 3>and 20 minutes.</v>

3941
03:02:48.751 --> 03:02:50.670
<v Speaker 3>And you were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're right for that moment.</v>

3942
03:02:50.700 --> 03:02:52.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a massive flaw.</v>

3943
03:02:52.230 --> 03:02:52.800
<v Speaker 3>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

3944
03:02:52.800 --> 03:02:53.790
<v Speaker 3>it's not a flaw.</v>

3945
03:02:54.220 --> 03:02:56.400
<v Speaker 6>It's just a pattern that you allow,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

3946
03:02:56.410 --> 03:02:58.620
<v Speaker 6>Because you've had it in your life and</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

3947
03:02:58.740 --> 03:02:59.860
<v Speaker 6>it's such a struggle</v>

3948
03:03:00.640 --> 03:03:01.990
<v Speaker 3>excepted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's existence.</v>

3949
03:03:02.020 --> 03:03:02.650
<v Speaker 3>You're right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3950
03:03:02.650 --> 03:03:03.430
<v Speaker 3>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're right.</v>

3951
03:03:03.430 --> 03:03:04.800
<v Speaker 3>This is where the rubber hits the road,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3952
03:03:04.801 --> 03:03:07.570
<v Speaker 3>That's why I love you as my friend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's like these kinds of,</v>

3953
03:03:07.571 --> 03:03:09.730
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these kinds of patterns.</v>

3954
03:03:09.731 --> 03:03:12.520
<v Speaker 3>Like I guess the next time I find myself</v>
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>

3955
03:03:12.521 --> 03:03:16.360
<v Speaker 3>see there I'm doing it again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess when I'm eating cake or the next</v>

3956
03:03:16.361 --> 03:03:18.400
<v Speaker 3>time I'm putting some shitty sugar into</v>
<v Speaker 3>my math,</v>

3957
03:03:18.850 --> 03:03:22.900
<v Speaker 3>I just have to realize I'm threading the</v>
<v Speaker 3>necklace right now.</v>

3958
03:03:22.901 --> 03:03:27.901
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm the one who's like creating the</v>
<v Speaker 3>version of myself where I'm a little bit</v>

3959
03:03:28.571 --> 03:03:30.640
<v Speaker 3>out of shape and yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3960
03:03:30.641 --> 03:03:33.250
<v Speaker 3>and just as long as you realize that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're the one doing it,</v>

3961
03:03:33.460 --> 03:03:35.800
<v Speaker 3>that just throws you into such a funny</v>
<v Speaker 3>predicament though,</v>

3962
03:03:35.801 --> 03:03:38.020
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because when you realize like shit,</v>

3963
03:03:38.140 --> 03:03:42.160
<v Speaker 3>I am completely in control of who I am</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a person.</v>

3964
03:03:42.280 --> 03:03:43.900
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in this situation,</v>

3965
03:03:44.200 --> 03:03:49.200
<v Speaker 3>I'm making the decision to sculpt a</v>
<v Speaker 3>version of myself that sucks.</v>

3966
03:03:49.440 --> 03:03:51.400
<v Speaker 3>Or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

3967
03:03:51.401 --> 03:03:52.700
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and why.</v>

3968
03:03:53.140 --> 03:03:55.540
<v Speaker 3>And when you instill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when you and your defined by this</v>

3969
03:03:55.541 --> 03:03:57.110
<v Speaker 3>past version of you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3970
03:03:57.160 --> 03:03:58.130
<v Speaker 3>Like with all the knowledge</v>

3971
03:03:58.130 --> 03:04:00.710
<v Speaker 6>that you have right now in your head,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're still defined by all these</v>

3972
03:04:00.711 --> 03:04:02.260
<v Speaker 6>failures from a decade ago.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

3973
03:04:02.290 --> 03:04:02.960
<v Speaker 6>More,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

3974
03:04:02.960 --> 03:04:05.720
<v Speaker 6>They're all fucking rolling around in</v>
<v Speaker 6>your head that you have to repeat them.</v>

3975
03:04:06.040 --> 03:04:07.400
<v Speaker 6>This is what I do,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

3976
03:04:07.700 --> 03:04:08.421
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're totally right.</v>

3977
03:04:08.421 --> 03:04:09.650
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's still cool.</v>

3978
03:04:09.710 --> 03:04:11.090
<v Speaker 6>Total blind spot,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

3979
03:04:11.091 --> 03:04:13.190
<v Speaker 6>You're right though.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That is a way that I talked to myself.</v>

3980
03:04:13.191 --> 03:04:15.210
<v Speaker 6>Everybody does it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What I do,</v>

3981
03:04:15.211 --> 03:04:17.840
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to find her sets fucking hilarious.</v>

3982
03:04:18.120 --> 03:04:21.110
<v Speaker 6>Well at the mind is so goddamn tricky</v>
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

3983
03:04:21.680 --> 03:04:23.090
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

3984
03:04:23.091 --> 03:04:25.220
<v Speaker 6>That's really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Here's one thing that I've gotten out of</v>

3985
03:04:25.221 --> 03:04:28.580
<v Speaker 6>this wacky diet that I'm on for the last</v>
<v Speaker 6>16 days or so,</v>

3986
03:04:28.581 --> 03:04:30.170
<v Speaker 6>17 days,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whatever it is right now,</v>

3987
03:04:30.410 --> 03:04:32.120
<v Speaker 6>it's something after two weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3988
03:04:34.220 --> 03:04:35.240
<v Speaker 6>I'm not less happy.</v>

3989
03:04:36.740 --> 03:04:37.460
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

3990
03:04:37.460 --> 03:04:40.240
<v Speaker 6>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not less happy from eating shitty</v>

3991
03:04:40.241 --> 03:04:40.851
<v Speaker 6>food,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3992
03:04:40.851 --> 03:04:42.910
<v Speaker 6>Like my kids had cupcakes last night</v>
<v Speaker 6>after dinner.</v>

3993
03:04:42.911 --> 03:04:44.320
<v Speaker 6>There's a little cupcakes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>little tiny ones.</v>

3994
03:04:44.321 --> 03:04:46.570
<v Speaker 6>They have 10 grams of sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 6>One fucking little tiny cupcake.</v>

3995
03:04:47.100 --> 03:04:48.810
<v Speaker 6>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like how much is a big one happened</v>

3996
03:04:48.830 --> 03:04:50.950
<v Speaker 6>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I didn't feel bad.</v>

3997
03:04:51.370 --> 03:04:56.200
<v Speaker 6>I don't feel bad that I'm not getting to</v>
<v Speaker 6>eat a cupcake and I don't feel bad that</v>

3998
03:04:56.201 --> 03:04:58.810
<v Speaker 6>I'm not eating a bowl of pasta.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It looks amazing.</v>

3999
03:04:58.960 --> 03:05:02.350
<v Speaker 6>I bet it's great when it goes down.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not affecting my happiness,</v>

4000
03:05:02.860 --> 03:05:06.700
<v Speaker 6>but if I got fat,</v>
<v Speaker 6>would it affect my happiness if I looked</v>

4001
03:05:06.701 --> 03:05:07.660
<v Speaker 6>at myself in the mirror,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>

4002
03:05:07.661 --> 03:05:10.560
<v Speaker 6>you fucking slaw.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What does all this shit I can't wrap</v>

4003
03:05:10.570 --> 03:05:13.000
<v Speaker 6>around here?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And there's all this stuff that affects</v>

4004
03:05:13.001 --> 03:05:15.160
<v Speaker 6>my happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It affects the way I move.</v>

4005
03:05:15.340 --> 03:05:17.110
<v Speaker 6>It affects the way my body recovers.</v>

4006
03:05:17.260 --> 03:05:19.930
<v Speaker 6>It affects the way my energy levels are,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

4007
03:05:19.931 --> 03:05:24.820
<v Speaker 6>The food I eat 100% affects the way my</v>
<v Speaker 6>entire day goes.</v>

4008
03:05:25.060 --> 03:05:30.060
<v Speaker 6>If I eat a big ass salad in the morning</v>
<v Speaker 6>with Avocados and olive oil and Balsamic</v>

4009
03:05:30.821 --> 03:05:35.821
<v Speaker 6>vinegarette and I eat that and I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>then I have some coconut oil or mct oil</v>

4010
03:05:35.861 --> 03:05:37.870
<v Speaker 6>and some coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then I have,</v>

4011
03:05:38.020 --> 03:05:39.520
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>maybe a small,</v>

4012
03:05:39.521 --> 03:05:44.260
<v Speaker 6>a bowl of blueberries with some plain</v>
<v Speaker 6>yogurt and I'm eating like nothing but</v>

4013
03:05:44.261 --> 03:05:46.570
<v Speaker 6>healthy food.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then I'll have like an elk steak</v>

4014
03:05:46.571 --> 03:05:47.860
<v Speaker 6>with some asparagus.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Dude,</v>

4015
03:05:47.861 --> 03:05:50.110
<v Speaker 6>I feel fucking great.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I feel great.</v>

4016
03:05:50.350 --> 03:05:53.470
<v Speaker 6>I've got crazy energy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>My energy levels were very high.</v>

4017
03:05:53.620 --> 03:05:56.230
<v Speaker 6>I'm drinking water all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No juices,</v>

4018
03:05:56.380 --> 03:05:57.790
<v Speaker 6>no bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no sugar,</v>

4019
03:05:57.820 --> 03:06:00.160
<v Speaker 6>no nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I am more happy.</v>

4020
03:06:00.990 --> 03:06:03.840
<v Speaker 6>I'm not less happy because I'm not</v>
<v Speaker 6>getting the sugar right.</v>

4021
03:06:03.870 --> 03:06:06.000
<v Speaker 6>It was only for a couple days.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a trick,</v>

4022
03:06:06.020 --> 03:06:07.530
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a fucking trick.</v>

4023
03:06:07.531 --> 03:06:09.380
<v Speaker 6>We've all fallen into man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

4024
03:06:09.570 --> 03:06:11.880
<v Speaker 6>We look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We'd go to get a Burrito and you get a</v>

4025
03:06:11.881 --> 03:06:13.800
<v Speaker 6>fucking soda and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yay.</v>

4026
03:06:14.340 --> 03:06:18.900
<v Speaker 6>But the things that you're getting the</v>
<v Speaker 6>pleasure out of our tricks and they're</v>

4027
03:06:18.901 --> 03:06:21.900
<v Speaker 6>not there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a temporary thing that will ruin</v>

4028
03:06:21.901 --> 03:06:24.570
<v Speaker 6>the rest of the enjoyment of your</v>
<v Speaker 6>experience in life.</v>

4029
03:06:24.590 --> 03:06:26.490
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It will sabotage it.</v>

4030
03:06:26.610 --> 03:06:30.510
<v Speaker 6>It'll make it less effective.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It'll make your brain work shittier when</v>

4031
03:06:30.511 --> 03:06:33.180
<v Speaker 6>your brain is processing a giant bowl of</v>
<v Speaker 6>pasta.</v>

4032
03:06:33.360 --> 03:06:35.720
<v Speaker 6>Good luck winning jeopardy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

4033
03:06:35.980 --> 03:06:38.580
<v Speaker 6>Fucking luck.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Your brain's going to be dog shit with a</v>

4034
03:06:38.581 --> 03:06:41.190
<v Speaker 6>bowl of spaghetti and meatballs and a</v>
<v Speaker 6>beer.</v>

4035
03:06:41.310 --> 03:06:44.280
<v Speaker 6>You've got a dumb fucking brain.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She got a brain.</v>

4036
03:06:44.281 --> 03:06:44.941
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4037
03:06:44.941 --> 03:06:46.770
<v Speaker 6>everything's shut her down.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Shut her down,</v>

4038
03:06:46.860 --> 03:06:48.240
<v Speaker 6>shut off,</v>
<v Speaker 6>functions down.</v>

4039
03:06:48.330 --> 03:06:50.490
<v Speaker 6>You've got critical functions,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just eh,</v>

4040
03:06:50.790 --> 03:06:52.650
<v Speaker 6>heartbeat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Breathe.</v>

4041
03:06:52.710 --> 03:06:53.970
<v Speaker 6>Make sure you figured out how to get</v>
<v Speaker 6>home.</v>

4042
03:06:54.150 --> 03:06:56.460
<v Speaker 6>All the other fucking the universe</v>

4043
03:06:56.460 --> 03:06:59.520
<v Speaker 4>and reestablishing your existence and no</v>
<v Speaker 4>title.</v>

4044
03:06:59.640 --> 03:07:01.140
<v Speaker 4>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bowlful of Shit.</v>

4045
03:07:01.680 --> 03:07:04.670
<v Speaker 4>We just throw it down the hatch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've got to fucking process now.</v>

4046
03:07:05.100 --> 03:07:06.150
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4047
03:07:06.180 --> 03:07:11.180
<v Speaker 4>in most</v>
<v Speaker 4>religious traditions and especially most</v>

4048
03:07:12.151 --> 03:07:15.990
<v Speaker 4>meditative practices,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one thing you never hear people say is</v>

4049
03:07:16.510 --> 03:07:17.730
<v Speaker 4>she see you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever you want,</v>

4050
03:07:18.880 --> 03:07:22.560
<v Speaker 4>or we're going to just do this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just eat whatever you want and it'll</v>

4051
03:07:22.590 --> 03:07:25.620
<v Speaker 4>usually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's like some fairly like strict</v>

4052
03:07:26.040 --> 03:07:29.280
<v Speaker 4>ideas of like what to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Usually it involves eating very simple</v>

4053
03:07:29.281 --> 03:07:30.001
<v Speaker 4>foods.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4054
03:07:30.001 --> 03:07:32.250
<v Speaker 4>just like eating lentils,</v>
<v Speaker 4>rice,</v>

4055
03:07:32.370 --> 03:07:36.000
<v Speaker 4>but being very simple and what you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you eat and eating much less than</v>

4056
03:07:36.001 --> 03:07:37.710
<v Speaker 4>what you eat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fasting.</v>

4057
03:07:37.960 --> 03:07:42.390
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people recommend fasting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fasting has a scientific reason behind</v>

4058
03:07:42.391 --> 03:07:44.340
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's the same thing that I'm trying</v>

4059
03:07:44.341 --> 03:07:47.100
<v Speaker 4>to do with this diet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's establishing ketosis.</v>

4060
03:07:47.170 --> 03:07:50.670
<v Speaker 4>S a a state of ketosis where your body's</v>
<v Speaker 4>living off of fat.</v>

4061
03:07:50.850 --> 03:07:54.860
<v Speaker 4>One of the best ways to do that is</v>
<v Speaker 4>intermittent fasting right fast and</v>

4062
03:07:54.861 --> 03:07:59.280
<v Speaker 4>gives your body a chance to process all</v>
<v Speaker 4>the food that it has in its system and</v>

4063
03:07:59.281 --> 03:08:04.080
<v Speaker 4>then switch over to using fats.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a normal part of being a person</v>

4064
03:08:04.260 --> 03:08:07.860
<v Speaker 4>because being a human being for the</v>
<v Speaker 4>longest time did not mean three square</v>

4065
03:08:07.861 --> 03:08:08.840
<v Speaker 4>meals a day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4066
03:08:08.930 --> 03:08:12.540
<v Speaker 4>It meant going on these journeys where</v>
<v Speaker 4>you didn't get any food for a couple of</v>

4067
03:08:12.540 --> 03:08:14.400
<v Speaker 4>days.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if your body is glucose based,</v>

4068
03:08:14.401 --> 03:08:16.830
<v Speaker 4>and obviously I'm not a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>scientist and obviously there's a lot of</v>

4069
03:08:16.831 --> 03:08:20.250
<v Speaker 4>people that disagree with me and there's</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people that disagree with Mark</v>

4070
03:08:20.250 --> 03:08:22.110
<v Speaker 4>Sisson and all these other people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Augustino,</v>

4071
03:08:22.111 --> 03:08:26.300
<v Speaker 4>all these different scientists and</v>
<v Speaker 4>biologists who swear by this key to</v>

4072
03:08:26.310 --> 03:08:28.590
<v Speaker 4>genic diet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is a very controversial thing.</v>

4073
03:08:28.591 --> 03:08:30.750
<v Speaker 4>So let me just say this right away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a scientist,</v>

4074
03:08:30.780 --> 03:08:31.590
<v Speaker 4>I'm just trying it out.</v>

4075
03:08:31.590 --> 03:08:36.210
<v Speaker 4>But the reasoning behind it to me is</v>
<v Speaker 4>very rational and it makes sense that if</v>

4076
03:08:36.211 --> 03:08:38.820
<v Speaker 4>you're constantly taking carbohydrates</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're living off these</v>

4077
03:08:38.821 --> 03:08:42.960
<v Speaker 4>carbohydrates as your main fuel source,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is what you do when you eat a lot</v>

4078
03:08:42.961 --> 03:08:45.180
<v Speaker 4>of carbohydrates,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is what's been established when</v>

4079
03:08:45.181 --> 03:08:48.180
<v Speaker 4>your body's in a state of Ketosis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's living off of fats,</v>

4080
03:08:48.300 --> 03:08:51.570
<v Speaker 4>you're burning fats,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you could take exogenous ketones,</v>

4081
03:08:51.810 --> 03:08:54.150
<v Speaker 4>which is that these fucking things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I pour them into water.</v>

4082
03:08:54.660 --> 03:08:56.490
<v Speaker 4>There's a bunch of different companies</v>
<v Speaker 4>that create these.</v>

4083
03:08:57.270 --> 03:08:58.810
<v Speaker 4>Kido Kana is one that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4084
03:08:58.830 --> 03:09:01.650
<v Speaker 4>my friend denny uses it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know a lot of athletes that are doing</v>

4085
03:09:01.651 --> 03:09:02.970
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kyle Kingsbury,</v>

4086
03:09:02.971 --> 03:09:04.650
<v Speaker 4>who is a former UFC fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy.</v>

4089

<v Speaker 4>a black belts.</v>

03:09:10.321 --> 03:09:12.840
<v Speaker 4>He runs a 10th planet San Francisco,</v>
<v Speaker 4>good friend of mine.</v>

4091
03:09:12.990 --> 03:09:16.350
<v Speaker 4>He's in a state of Ketosis to make</v>
<v Speaker 4>meeting mostly fats,</v>

4092
03:09:16.590 --> 03:09:19.440
<v Speaker 4>eating oils like coconut oils,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Avocados,</v>

4093
03:09:19.441 --> 03:09:20.310
<v Speaker 4>things along those lines.</v>

4094
03:09:20.430 --> 03:09:23.160
<v Speaker 4>Healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>healthy grass fed meats.</v>

4095
03:09:23.161 --> 03:09:25.140
<v Speaker 4>What about like gluten free bread?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that okay?</v>

4096
03:09:25.170 --> 03:09:26.850
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause this is all grains.</v>

4097
03:09:26.880 --> 03:09:28.520
<v Speaker 4>Those are carbohydrates.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is not,</v>

4098
03:09:28.710 --> 03:09:30.510
<v Speaker 4>it's not that it's bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What about rice?</v>

4099
03:09:30.511 --> 03:09:32.470
<v Speaker 4>You could exist off rice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>brown rice,</v>

4100
03:09:32.530 --> 03:09:33.450
<v Speaker 4>brown rice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

4101
03:09:33.510 --> 03:09:35.280
<v Speaker 4>You can be fine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're not listening.</v>

4102
03:09:35.490 --> 03:09:38.520
<v Speaker 4>All right has your carbohydrates.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you use that as your primary food</v>

4103
03:09:38.550 --> 03:09:40.170
<v Speaker 4>fuel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not going to be in a state of</v>

4104
03:09:40.171 --> 03:09:42.150
<v Speaker 4>ketosis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's easy for your body to process</v>

4105
03:09:42.151 --> 03:09:45.000
<v Speaker 4>carbohydrates like this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you're in a state of Ketosis,</v>

4106
03:09:45.001 --> 03:09:47.850
<v Speaker 4>your body's processing fats.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When your body's processing fats,</v>

4107
03:09:47.851 --> 03:09:50.370
<v Speaker 4>here's where it gets really weird in</v>
<v Speaker 4>between meals.</v>

4108
03:09:50.490 --> 03:09:54.010
<v Speaker 4>You don't get a crash.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't crash like I was crashing.</v>

4109
03:09:54.160 --> 03:09:55.990
<v Speaker 6>If I had like breakfast.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

4110
03:09:56.140 --> 03:10:01.140
<v Speaker 6>And if I had breakfast and it was toast</v>
<v Speaker 6>with a potatoes and rice and beans and</v>

4111
03:10:01.830 --> 03:10:02.900
<v Speaker 6>it's all carbs,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right,</v>

4112
03:10:03.020 --> 03:10:03.791
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Meeting this,</v>

4113
03:10:03.791 --> 03:10:06.130
<v Speaker 6>this breakfast,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's gonna come a time,</v>

4114
03:10:06.131 --> 03:10:09.010
<v Speaker 6>a few hours later while I'm fucking</v>
<v Speaker 6>starving,</v>

4115
03:10:09.160 --> 03:10:10.500
<v Speaker 6>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm starving.</v>

4116
03:10:10.570 --> 03:10:13.210
<v Speaker 6>I don't get that right now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not getting that.</v>

4117
03:10:13.630 --> 03:10:17.470
<v Speaker 6>I can go a long time without eating.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like I eat breakfast and then I'm good</v>

4118
03:10:17.471 --> 03:10:19.900
<v Speaker 6>for hours and hours and hours of</v>
<v Speaker 6>nothing.</v>

4119
03:10:20.110 --> 03:10:21.610
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I might have a little snack here and</v>

4120
03:10:21.611 --> 03:10:24.070
<v Speaker 6>there,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I don't absolutely need it like I</v>

4121
03:10:24.071 --> 03:10:24.750
<v Speaker 6>did.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

4122
03:10:24.750 --> 03:10:26.350
<v Speaker 6>I was eating a lot of carbohydrates.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

4123
03:10:26.351 --> 03:10:27.240
<v Speaker 6>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm,</v>

4124
03:10:27.241 --> 03:10:28.300
<v Speaker 6>I'm look,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm just trying this.</v>

4125
03:10:28.301 --> 03:10:32.200
<v Speaker 6>I might go back after 60 days and say I</v>
<v Speaker 6>like this,</v>

4126
03:10:32.230 --> 03:10:36.400
<v Speaker 6>but I also like to have a certain amount</v>
<v Speaker 6>of carbohydrates in my diet because it</v>

4127
03:10:36.401 --> 03:10:39.220
<v Speaker 6>makes it easier for me to find healthy</v>
<v Speaker 6>foods to eat because I don't think</v>

4128
03:10:39.221 --> 03:10:42.460
<v Speaker 6>there's anything is not,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's not negative consequences to a</v>

4129
03:10:42.461 --> 03:10:46.840
<v Speaker 6>carbohydrate based diet,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I think there are some positives to</v>

4130
03:10:46.841 --> 03:10:49.630
<v Speaker 6>consider about being in a state of</v>
<v Speaker 6>ketosis.</v>

4131
03:10:49.690 --> 03:10:51.520
<v Speaker 6>And so I'm trying it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So that's where I'm at right now,</v>

4132
03:10:51.910 --> 03:10:53.980
<v Speaker 6>but,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but in the discipline,</v>

4133
03:10:54.070 --> 03:10:58.360
<v Speaker 6>in forcing myself to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it makes me think that a lot of what we</v>

4134
03:10:58.361 --> 03:11:02.470
<v Speaker 6>were talking about earlier about not</v>
<v Speaker 6>having control of your impulses and your</v>

4135
03:11:02.471 --> 03:11:05.440
<v Speaker 6>behavior and getting,</v>
<v Speaker 6>giving into video game addiction and</v>

4136
03:11:05.441 --> 03:11:08.650
<v Speaker 6>giving into cell phone addiction on</v>
<v Speaker 6>social media addiction,</v>

4137
03:11:08.651 --> 03:11:12.430
<v Speaker 6>all these things.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think they're all very related and</v>

4138
03:11:12.431 --> 03:11:14.680
<v Speaker 6>that I think that discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is a guy that I know,</v>

4139
03:11:14.681 --> 03:11:17.560
<v Speaker 6>his name is Jocko willink and he's a</v>
<v Speaker 6>former navy seal.</v>

4140
03:11:17.740 --> 03:11:19.450
<v Speaker 6>He's got a podcast now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I talked him into it.</v>

4141
03:11:19.451 --> 03:11:23.440
<v Speaker 6>He's got this great book that he wrote.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think I have it here somewhere.</v>

4142
03:11:23.510 --> 03:11:24.420
<v Speaker 6>It's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's actually,</v>

4143
03:11:24.421 --> 03:11:27.110
<v Speaker 6>it's actually out there on the coffee</v>
<v Speaker 6>table owners.</v>

4144
03:11:27.120 --> 03:11:28.240
<v Speaker 6>She extreme ownership.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Thank you.</v>

4145
03:11:28.600 --> 03:11:30.970
<v Speaker 6>Fascinating guy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He came ownership,</v>

4146
03:11:31.060 --> 03:11:32.980
<v Speaker 6>he's got,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but he's got this one statement that</v>

4147
03:11:32.981 --> 03:11:34.330
<v Speaker 6>discipline equals freedom.</v>

4148
03:11:35.560 --> 03:11:36.910
<v Speaker 6>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

4149
03:11:36.911 --> 03:11:37.990
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well how do you mean?</v>

4150
03:11:38.020 --> 03:11:39.010
<v Speaker 6>What do you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what do you mean by that?</v>

4151
03:11:39.011 --> 03:11:41.110
<v Speaker 6>And he explained it to me in very</v>
<v Speaker 6>succinct terms.</v>

4152
03:11:41.650 --> 03:11:43.840
<v Speaker 6>If you have the discipline to get all</v>
<v Speaker 6>the shit done,</v>

4153
03:11:43.870 --> 03:11:46.750
<v Speaker 6>then you can do things you enjoy and</v>
<v Speaker 6>then you're,</v>

4154
03:11:46.751 --> 03:11:49.600
<v Speaker 6>you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're not compromised by your lack of</v>

4155
03:11:49.601 --> 03:11:51.730
<v Speaker 6>discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're not trapped by your lack of</v>

4156
03:11:51.731 --> 03:11:55.030
<v Speaker 6>discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When you're emerging from a fucking 16</v>

4157
03:11:55.031 --> 03:11:57.490
<v Speaker 6>hour binge of playing video games,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're stepping outside.</v>

4158
03:11:57.491 --> 03:12:00.040
<v Speaker 6>It's 9:00 AM and your eyes are</v>
<v Speaker 6>bloodshot.</v>

4159
03:12:00.041 --> 03:12:03.010
<v Speaker 6>You feel like a fucking prisoner and</v>
<v Speaker 6>your Dick is rock.</v>

4160
03:12:03.011 --> 03:12:04.690
<v Speaker 6>He's been beaten off the last 45</v>
<v Speaker 6>minutes.</v>

4161
03:12:05.150 --> 03:12:08.630
<v Speaker 6>Did you fuck your prisoner?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're a prisoner to your indulgences.</v>

4162
03:12:08.980 --> 03:12:11.410
<v Speaker 6>The same thing I think can be said with</v>
<v Speaker 6>your diet.</v>

4163
03:12:11.590 --> 03:12:15.430
<v Speaker 6>The same thing can be said with</v>
<v Speaker 6>indulging the idea of you always being</v>

4164
03:12:15.431 --> 03:12:16.690
<v Speaker 6>in a state of being overweight.</v>

4165
03:12:16.870 --> 03:12:19.840
<v Speaker 6>The same thing can be said with a</v>
<v Speaker 6>million other things that people do that</v>

4166
03:12:19.841 --> 03:12:22.480
<v Speaker 6>they never follow through on.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I always wanted to be a singer.</v>

4167
03:12:22.600 --> 03:12:25.630
<v Speaker 6>I never had the balls to pursue it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I always wanted to be a painter,</v>

4168
03:12:25.720 --> 03:12:29.110
<v Speaker 6>but I never had the time to paint after</v>
<v Speaker 6>my fucking job because I'm working over</v>

4169
03:12:29.250 --> 03:12:31.140
<v Speaker 6>because I just bought a new car.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But a little,</v>

4170
03:12:31.141 --> 03:12:31.661
<v Speaker 6>a little,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a little,</v>

4171
03:12:31.661 --> 03:12:32.494
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

4172
03:12:32.830 --> 03:12:35.680
<v Speaker 6>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's traps that we will set for</v>

4173
03:12:35.681 --> 03:12:37.030
<v Speaker 6>ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but if you,</v>

4174
03:12:37.060 --> 03:12:41.500
<v Speaker 6>if you give yourself a healthy trap,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you give yourself like a healthy</v>

4175
03:12:41.501 --> 03:12:43.500
<v Speaker 6>protocol,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a healthy directive,</v>

4176
03:12:43.540 --> 03:12:45.880
<v Speaker 6>a healthy pattern that you have to</v>
<v Speaker 6>follow,</v>

4177
03:12:46.000 --> 03:12:50.800
<v Speaker 6>you find some peace in that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And the thing about this fucking wacky</v>

4178
03:12:50.810 --> 03:12:55.640
<v Speaker 6>diet is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the thing that's most shocking to me is</v>

4179
03:12:55.641 --> 03:13:00.641
<v Speaker 6>that I'm not any less happy than I'd be</v>
<v Speaker 6>if I was eating ice cream or stuff and</v>

4180
03:13:00.801 --> 03:13:04.100
<v Speaker 6>pizza down my fat phase are letting my</v>
<v Speaker 6>book and cheeks blow,</v>

4181
03:13:04.140 --> 03:13:06.650
<v Speaker 6>but</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not,</v>

4182
03:13:06.651 --> 03:13:08.870
<v Speaker 6>I'm not any less happy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm happy,</v>

4183
03:13:09.130 --> 03:13:09.950
<v Speaker 6>I'm very happy.</v>

4184
03:13:09.950 --> 03:13:13.690
<v Speaker 6>I'm more happy because I have energy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So even if it's not a car bay</v>

4185
03:13:13.970 --> 03:13:15.650
<v Speaker 6>carbohydrate thing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>even if it's just a,</v>

4186
03:13:15.920 --> 03:13:18.290
<v Speaker 6>I've eliminated sugars,</v>
<v Speaker 6>even if it's,</v>

4187
03:13:18.291 --> 03:13:22.700
<v Speaker 6>I've just allowed myself my body to take</v>
<v Speaker 6>a break off the fucking insulin spike,</v>

4188
03:13:22.950 --> 03:13:25.010
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Eating a giant bowl of pasta,</v>

4189
03:13:25.040 --> 03:13:27.800
<v Speaker 6>even if it's just that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whatever the fuck it is,</v>

4190
03:13:28.130 --> 03:13:30.560
<v Speaker 6>it's working and I think they're</v>
<v Speaker 6>connected.</v>

4191
03:13:30.770 --> 03:13:34.100
<v Speaker 6>I think it's connected to me forcing</v>
<v Speaker 6>myself to get regular exercise.</v>

4192
03:13:34.280 --> 03:13:36.410
<v Speaker 6>I don't allow myself to not get</v>
<v Speaker 6>exercise.</v>

4193
03:13:36.650 --> 03:13:39.170
<v Speaker 6>It's not in there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't allow it because I've done it</v>

4194
03:13:39.171 --> 03:13:40.340
<v Speaker 6>before.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't like it.</v>

4195
03:13:40.490 --> 03:13:41.900
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I don't allow it.</v>

4196
03:13:41.960 --> 03:13:44.300
<v Speaker 6>And in not allowing it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's never an option.</v>

4197
03:13:44.510 --> 03:13:47.450
<v Speaker 6>So if I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if my alarm is set and I get up and it's</v>

4198
03:13:47.451 --> 03:13:48.360
<v Speaker 6>what's Today,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

4199
03:13:48.760 --> 03:13:50.900
<v Speaker 6>today is death sprints on the elliptical</v>
<v Speaker 6>machine.</v>

4200
03:13:50.901 --> 03:13:52.470
<v Speaker 6>Well that's what I have to fucking do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

4201
03:13:52.520 --> 03:13:53.690
<v Speaker 6>We just do it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Cause I don't,</v>

4202
03:13:53.750 --> 03:13:56.120
<v Speaker 6>I can't do everything and unless I do</v>
<v Speaker 6>everything,</v>

4203
03:13:56.240 --> 03:13:58.340
<v Speaker 6>unless I follow all the shit that I have</v>
<v Speaker 6>on my list,</v>

4204
03:13:58.580 --> 03:14:01.070
<v Speaker 6>I'm not going to be able to go fuck off</v>
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

4205
03:14:01.071 --> 03:14:03.050
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and enjoy a television show.</v>

4206
03:14:03.190 --> 03:14:05.360
<v Speaker 6>I'm not going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not going to appreciate those things</v>

4207
03:14:05.540 --> 03:14:09.500
<v Speaker 6>because I've forced myself to get the</v>
<v Speaker 6>shit done that I need to get done.</v>

4208
03:14:09.650 --> 03:14:13.670
<v Speaker 6>And I forced myself to follow this weird</v>
<v Speaker 6>pattern.</v>

4209
03:14:14.030 --> 03:14:16.940
<v Speaker 1>Discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could do the same thing.</v>

4210
03:14:17.750 --> 03:14:18.590
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4211
03:14:18.591 --> 03:14:21.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean I know I could do about it could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4212
03:14:21.110 --> 03:14:22.310
<v Speaker 1>it's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's a,</v>

4213
03:14:22.311 --> 03:14:24.430
<v Speaker 1>it's a beautiful idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it really is like the,</v>

4214
03:14:24.440 --> 03:14:27.350
<v Speaker 1>I think there is something like very</v>
<v Speaker 1>exciting about it.</v>

4215
03:14:27.351 --> 03:14:31.880
<v Speaker 1>Anytime I've pulled off even the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>mild discipline in my life,</v>

4216
03:14:32.390 --> 03:14:37.280
<v Speaker 1>the end result is like incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you been raving about how good you</v>

4217
03:14:37.281 --> 03:14:40.220
<v Speaker 1>felt once you started working out with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>trainer for a couple of months?</v>

4218
03:14:40.330 --> 03:14:42.050
<v Speaker 1>But I read the exact thing you were</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>

4219
03:14:42.051 --> 03:14:45.380
<v Speaker 1>I fucking hurt myself doing dead lifts</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>

4220
03:14:45.470 --> 03:14:48.170
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of that injury I stopped working</v>

4221
03:14:48.171 --> 03:14:52.490
<v Speaker 1>out and then because of that I use that</v>
<v Speaker 1>as an excuse and then I started like,</v>

4222
03:14:52.520 --> 03:14:54.950
<v Speaker 1>I just fell off the wagon again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should,</v>

4223
03:14:54.980 --> 03:14:57.320
<v Speaker 1>you should do something that's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>practice,</v>

4224
03:14:57.750 --> 03:14:58.640
<v Speaker 1>that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4225
03:14:58.641 --> 03:15:00.020
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a martial art,</v>

4226
03:15:00.230 --> 03:15:01.820
<v Speaker 1>which you tried a little bit in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>past,</v>

4227
03:15:01.940 --> 03:15:06.200
<v Speaker 1>but I think the best one for you at this</v>
<v Speaker 1>point is probably yoga because I think</v>

4228
03:15:06.201 --> 03:15:08.150
<v Speaker 1>yoga fits right into your sensibilities.</v>

4229
03:15:08.180 --> 03:15:08.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's cool.</v>

4230
03:15:08.930 --> 03:15:12.260
<v Speaker 1>So instead of like having some guy who</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes over and makes you jump on a box</v>

4231
03:15:12.261 --> 03:15:14.570
<v Speaker 1>and skip rope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to a fucking yoga class,</v>

4232
03:15:14.571 --> 03:15:16.040
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4233
03:15:16.041 --> 03:15:16.880
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy,</v>

4234
03:15:16.920 --> 03:15:20.840
<v Speaker 1>the guy I work with at Equinox,</v>
<v Speaker 1>George Chen,</v>

4235
03:15:20.900 --> 03:15:23.760
<v Speaker 1>the best,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's fucking really cool mashery until</v>

4236
03:15:23.830 --> 03:15:25.430
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something in that.</v>

4237
03:15:25.550 --> 03:15:28.400
<v Speaker 1>But I'm not going to do that forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't afford a trainer forever.</v>

4238
03:15:28.401 --> 03:15:29.800
<v Speaker 1>But what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you listen more?</v>

4239
03:15:29.860 --> 03:15:30.960
<v Speaker 1>More crazy talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

4240
03:15:30.961 --> 03:15:32.360
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's going to start not being</v>

4241
03:15:32.361 --> 03:15:34.610
<v Speaker 1>successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to start failing at comedy.</v>

4242
03:15:34.640 --> 03:15:36.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't want to like,</v>

4243
03:15:36.410 --> 03:15:37.880
<v Speaker 1>I just don't want to have a trainer</v>
<v Speaker 1>forever.</v>

4244
03:15:37.881 --> 03:15:39.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to have a trainer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4245
03:15:39.800 --> 03:15:42.650
<v Speaker 1>so this is great man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is an awesome therapy.</v>

4246
03:15:42.651 --> 03:15:45.680
<v Speaker 1>Like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really cool now your identify like</v>

4247
03:15:45.681 --> 03:15:48.080
<v Speaker 1>it's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're being like very strict on the way</v>

4248
03:15:48.081 --> 03:15:49.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking like to myself.</v>

4249
03:15:49.590 --> 03:15:50.280
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

4250
03:15:50.280 --> 03:15:53.360
<v Speaker 1>I just know you write real good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4251
03:15:53.390 --> 03:15:55.100
<v Speaker 1>We've been friends for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>

4252
03:15:55.230 --> 03:15:57.930
<v Speaker 1>And this is this one thing where you'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>come in and come out of,</v>

4253
03:15:57.990 --> 03:15:59.310
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a trance.</v>

4254
03:15:59.610 --> 03:16:00.750
<v Speaker 1>When you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're in a trance,</v>

4255
03:16:00.751 --> 03:16:02.820
<v Speaker 1>I almost forgot to grab your shoulders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wake up.</v>

4256
03:16:03.840 --> 03:16:05.970
<v Speaker 1>But you'll come out of that trance guns</v>
<v Speaker 1>blazing.</v>

4257
03:16:05.971 --> 03:16:06.571
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

4258
03:16:06.571 --> 03:16:08.880
<v Speaker 1>I had a fucking sound and I ran four</v>
<v Speaker 1>miles.</v>

4259
03:16:10.190 --> 03:16:11.890
<v Speaker 1>It's the best you come out of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>training,</v>

4260
03:16:12.890 --> 03:16:15.340
<v Speaker 1>but then you'll slide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll slow.</v>

4261
03:16:15.570 --> 03:16:18.090
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like having a trainer because he</v>

4262
03:16:18.091 --> 03:16:23.091
<v Speaker 1>forces you to like really work hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like way harder than normally.</v>

4263
03:16:24.121 --> 03:16:28.650
<v Speaker 1>I forced myself to work out like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>trainer makes you feel like you're like</v>

4264
03:16:28.710 --> 03:16:33.710
<v Speaker 1>passing out from in its crate and I end</v>
<v Speaker 1>the feeling after working out hard like</v>

4265
03:16:34.351 --> 03:16:35.960
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing like it.</v>

4266
03:16:36.130 --> 03:16:40.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't know anything like it better</v>
<v Speaker 1>than almost anything that I could think</v>

4267
03:16:40.261 --> 03:16:40.440
<v Speaker 1>of.</v>

4268
03:16:40.440 --> 03:16:43.620
<v Speaker 1>It's the most incredible thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to do it regularly,</v>

4269
03:16:43.621 --> 03:16:45.660
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also the Diet.</v>

4270
03:16:45.661 --> 03:16:46.620
<v Speaker 1>It's all diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>

4271
03:16:46.630 --> 03:16:50.100
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my real problem is just eating like shit</v>

4272
03:16:50.101 --> 03:16:52.020
<v Speaker 1>at night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sucks.</v>

4273
03:16:52.050 --> 03:16:56.220
<v Speaker 1>Just eat healthy at night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just [inaudible] just pull yourself and</v>

4274
03:16:56.221 --> 03:17:00.780
<v Speaker 1>I swear you can do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Put yourself on a super strict diet for</v>

4275
03:17:00.781 --> 03:17:03.420
<v Speaker 1>20 days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just make it 20 days.</v>

4276
03:17:03.510 --> 03:17:08.130
<v Speaker 1>Just write down 20 days for 20 days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not eating any bullshit and make</v>

4277
03:17:08.131 --> 03:17:10.380
<v Speaker 1>them write down what you can and can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat or you know,</v>

4278
03:17:10.390 --> 03:17:12.660
<v Speaker 1>maybe you can talk to a nutritionist</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not hard to do.</v>

4279
03:17:12.750 --> 03:17:14.520
<v Speaker 1>Say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to do this for my podcast.</v>

4280
03:17:14.521 --> 03:17:17.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to document it for 20 days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to eat real healthy.</v>

4281
03:17:17.380 --> 03:17:19.230
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of the reason why I said I was</v>

4282
03:17:19.231 --> 03:17:22.320
<v Speaker 1>going to do it for 60 days cause I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to say it on the air.</v>

4283
03:17:22.350 --> 03:17:24.960
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to say it as annoying as it</v>
<v Speaker 1>might be to hear me talk about it all</v>

4284
03:17:24.961 --> 03:17:28.500
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying it because I want to be</v>

4285
03:17:28.501 --> 03:17:29.610
<v Speaker 1>committed to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>

4286
03:17:29.611 --> 03:17:30.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

4287
03:17:30.300 --> 03:17:31.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say I'm just eating real</v>
<v Speaker 1>clean.</v>

4288
03:17:31.751 --> 03:17:32.910
<v Speaker 1>That's a smart way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4289
03:17:32.960 --> 03:17:36.330
<v Speaker 1>I forced herself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a whole scheme when I started</v>

4290
03:17:36.331 --> 03:17:39.840
<v Speaker 1>working at this last time that I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to get in really good shape and</v>

4291
03:17:39.841 --> 03:17:43.020
<v Speaker 1>then talk about how I did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I kept it a secret.</v>

4292
03:17:43.260 --> 03:17:44.910
<v Speaker 1>So like I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

4293
03:17:44.970 --> 03:17:46.920
<v Speaker 1>I was working out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started with Justin.</v>

4294
03:17:47.190 --> 03:17:48.900
<v Speaker 1>I was working so fucking hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4295
03:17:48.930 --> 03:17:53.730
<v Speaker 1>I really was like harder than I'd ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>done and then I just blew it and it</v>

4296
03:17:53.731 --> 03:17:55.230
<v Speaker 1>sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It happens,</v>

4297
03:17:55.231 --> 03:17:56.400
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sucks.</v>

4298
03:17:56.401 --> 03:17:59.370
<v Speaker 1>It's a constant battle that most people</v>
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>

4299
03:17:59.371 --> 03:18:01.290
<v Speaker 1>It's a constant trap that most people</v>
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>

4300
03:18:01.290 --> 03:18:05.070
<v Speaker 1>It's super fucking common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the most common things that</v>

4301
03:18:05.071 --> 03:18:07.590
<v Speaker 1>people fall back to where it's shitty</v>
<v Speaker 1>foods.</v>

4302
03:18:07.620 --> 03:18:11.010
<v Speaker 1>I love the year I will take into account</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you've said.</v>

4303
03:18:11.250 --> 03:18:11.941
<v Speaker 1>Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

4304
03:18:11.941 --> 03:18:14.490
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to continue to be super</v>
<v Speaker 1>personal.</v>

4305
03:18:14.760 --> 03:18:19.390
<v Speaker 1>The idea right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I think to just do 20 days of like</v>

4306
03:18:19.440 --> 03:18:22.140
<v Speaker 1>eating healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I think about that,</v>

4307
03:18:22.230 --> 03:18:25.830
<v Speaker 1>I feel like this combination of like</v>
<v Speaker 1>boredom and despair,</v>

4308
03:18:29.390 --> 03:18:31.890
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can still eat delicious food,</v>

4309
03:18:31.920 --> 03:18:34.020
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where it's so confusing.</v>

4310
03:18:34.170 --> 03:18:36.450
<v Speaker 1>You just don't drink fruit juice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4311
03:18:36.451 --> 03:18:38.310
<v Speaker 1>You get fruit juice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're drinking sugar water.</v>

4312
03:18:38.311 --> 03:18:40.440
<v Speaker 1>What an hour and even orange juice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4313
03:18:40.441 --> 03:18:43.170
<v Speaker 1>you're not supposed to eat an orange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4314
03:18:43.200 --> 03:18:46.110
<v Speaker 1>Don't drink that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not normal.</v>

4315
03:18:46.330 --> 03:18:47.980
<v Speaker 1>We figured some stupid way to</v>

4316
03:18:47.980 --> 03:18:50.890
<v Speaker 4>hijack our reward systems and jolted</v>
<v Speaker 4>with sugar,</v>

4317
03:18:50.920 --> 03:18:51.251
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>

4318
03:18:51.251 --> 03:18:53.350
<v Speaker 4>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now I've got my own Jay.</v>

4319
03:18:53.530 --> 03:18:56.160
<v Speaker 4>I'm drinking old.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You chicken fucking sugar.</v>

4320
03:18:56.590 --> 03:18:59.080
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's better than soda because</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's vitamin C in it,</v>

4321
03:18:59.100 --> 03:19:02.110
<v Speaker 4>but coconut water,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some of it is okay,</v>

4322
03:19:02.350 --> 03:19:05.860
<v Speaker 4>but if you drink too much of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's probably sweet,</v>

4323
03:19:06.280 --> 03:19:07.630
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If it's sweet,</v>

4324
03:19:07.631 --> 03:19:11.020
<v Speaker 4>there's some sugars in it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're supposed to eat the whole thing.</v>

4325
03:19:11.290 --> 03:19:13.870
<v Speaker 4>It's supposed to all be together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have an orange.</v>

4326
03:19:13.871 --> 03:19:15.490
<v Speaker 4>It's what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a fiber in that thing.</v>

4327
03:19:15.491 --> 03:19:16.480
<v Speaker 4>You're supposed to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's all,</v>

4328
03:19:16.481 --> 03:19:19.540
<v Speaker 4>it's supposed to be a part of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you eat an apple,</v>

4329
03:19:19.570 --> 03:19:22.610
<v Speaker 4>that's how supposed to get apple juice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Supposed to get it from the fucking not</v>

<v Speaker 4>and throw it into your fat horse.</v>

<v Speaker 4>there's a great show.</v>

4332

<v Speaker 4>I don't know how much time we have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's a,</v>

<v Speaker 4>when they talk about what it's like to</v>

4339
03:19:42.341 --> 03:19:45.700
<v Speaker 4>get fat like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how their personalities change.</v>

4340
03:19:45.850 --> 03:19:48.490
<v Speaker 4>Like they really throw themselves in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>hole and it's like,</v>

4341
03:19:48.640 --> 03:19:52.150
<v Speaker 4>it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The psychological component of it.</v>

4342

<v Speaker 4>you should watch it on 70 pounds on</v>
