<v Speaker 1>What's going on too loud,</v>

7
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.180

<v Speaker 1>I like to be loud.</v>

11
00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:27.013

20
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:33.313
<v Speaker 1>It's that button right there.</v>

21
00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:34.850
<v Speaker 1>One right below the clock.</v>

22
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.953
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.</v>

23
00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:37.040
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to my country,</v>

24
00:00:37.041 --> 00:00:37.491
<v Speaker 1>my friend.</v>

25
00:00:37.491 --> 00:00:40.250
<v Speaker 1>I know in your country it's frozen solid and you escaped.</v>

26
00:00:40.251 --> 00:00:40.950
<v Speaker 1>Came down here.</v>

27
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.280
<v Speaker 1>Did a little drinking last night maybe.</v>

28
00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:46.813
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

29
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.570
<v Speaker 3>Oh No.</v>

30
00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:47.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

31
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:48.793
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

32
00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.800
<v Speaker 3>I've been drinking lots of water and that's what I was telling you that,</v>

33
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

34
00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.280
<v Speaker 3>these long podcast was just wondering if I.</v>

35
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.330
<v Speaker 1>You can absolutely take a pee break.</v>

36
00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.410
<v Speaker 1>Do not be intimidated by the long form.</v>

37
00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.710
<v Speaker 1>We just try and have a conversation.</v>

38
00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.780
<v Speaker 1>Are you working on your new book and your new book is entitled the Atheist</v>

39
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:07.620
<v Speaker 1>Muslim.</v>

40
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.080
<v Speaker 1>That's that title is.</v>

41
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.060
<v Speaker 1>That's like jumbo shrimp or military intelligence.</v>

42
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.200
<v Speaker 1>Is that a one of those?</v>

43
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.113
<v Speaker 1>It was a</v>

44
00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.300
<v Speaker 3>partly a tongue and cheek thing and then there's a serious element to it,</v>

45
00:01:19.301 --> 00:01:20.860
<v Speaker 3>to the tongue in cheek thing is I was,</v>

46
00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:22.630
<v Speaker 3>I have a friend who's a,</v>

47
00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.640
<v Speaker 3>she calls herself a feminist Muslim,</v>

48
00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.260
<v Speaker 3>so I'm not going to name her right now.</v>

49
00:01:26.261 --> 00:01:26.730
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

50
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:27.370
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

51
00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.250
<v Speaker 3>so I always have fun conversations with her,</v>

52
00:01:30.251 --> 00:01:30.431
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

53
00:01:30.431 --> 00:01:32.080
<v Speaker 3>she's sort of nominally religious,</v>

54
00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.711
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

55
00:01:32.711 --> 00:01:33.544
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

56
00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

57
00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.511
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

58
00:01:34.511 --> 00:01:34.871
<v Speaker 3>that was like,</v>

59
00:01:34.871 --> 00:01:36.790
<v Speaker 3>how can you be a feminist Muslim?</v>

60
00:01:36.791 --> 00:01:39.810
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that like being a mediating vegetarian or you know,</v>

61
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.020
<v Speaker 3>it's a contradiction.</v>

62
00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:42.221
<v Speaker 3>And she's like,</v>

63
00:01:42.221 --> 00:01:42.881
<v Speaker 3>well no,</v>

64
00:01:42.881 --> 00:01:44.740
<v Speaker 3>there's parts of it that I liked.</v>

65
00:01:44.741 --> 00:01:45.760
<v Speaker 3>Parts of it I don't like.</v>

66
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.130
<v Speaker 3>So I just,</v>

67
00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.520
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

68
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.690
<v Speaker 3>me choose essentially saying that she cherry picks.</v>

69
00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.520
<v Speaker 3>So I figured.</v>

70
00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:52.031
<v Speaker 3>And then you know,</v>

71
00:01:52.031 --> 00:01:52.721
<v Speaker 3>there's other things,</v>

72
00:01:52.721 --> 00:01:56.020
<v Speaker 3>like there's lgbt Muslims in Toronto,</v>

73
00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.610
<v Speaker 3>there's a big community of great people.</v>

74
00:01:57.611 --> 00:01:58.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

75
00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.300
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

76
00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.840
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

77
00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:59.651
<v Speaker 3>Transgender,</v>

78
00:01:59.651 --> 00:02:00.484
<v Speaker 3>Muslims,</v>

79
00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:01.241
<v Speaker 3>transgender,</v>

80
00:02:01.241 --> 00:02:02.074
<v Speaker 3>Muslims,</v>

81
00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.921
<v Speaker 3>gay and lesbian,</v>

82
00:02:02.921 --> 00:02:03.260
<v Speaker 3>Muslim.</v>

83
00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.170
<v Speaker 1>That's a small crowd that's,</v>

84
00:02:05.171 --> 00:02:07.350
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to find your peers and it's,</v>

85
00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.611
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

86
00:02:07.611 --> 00:02:07.940
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

87
00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.440
<v Speaker 1>it's actually quite sizeable and it's like,</v>

88
00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.550
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

89
00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:11.720
<v Speaker 1>you mean that 10 people,</v>

90
00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.240
<v Speaker 1>how many transgender Muslims are there?</v>

91
00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.691
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

92
00:02:14.691 --> 00:02:14.961
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

93
00:02:14.961 --> 00:02:15.860
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what number,</v>

94
00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.110
<v Speaker 3>but they practice like,</v>

95
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.411
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

96
00:02:18.411 --> 00:02:19.730
<v Speaker 3>they practice their religious,</v>

97
00:02:19.731 --> 00:02:20.211
<v Speaker 3>they do,</v>

98
00:02:20.211 --> 00:02:20.780
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

99
00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.940
<v Speaker 3>they do like Friday prayers and you know,</v>

100
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.460
<v Speaker 3>things like that have a lot of events that go on.</v>

101
00:02:25.461 --> 00:02:25.940
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

102
00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.530
<v Speaker 1>but clearly in the Muslim religion like homosexuality and you know,</v>

103
00:02:30.531 --> 00:02:31.520
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of,</v>

104
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:32.220
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

105
00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.050
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of areas of that that are looked down upon.</v>

106
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.740
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

107
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:37.100
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

108
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.980
<v Speaker 1>So how does one justify that or rationalize</v>

109
00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.890
<v Speaker 3>in their head?</v>

110
00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:41.101
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

111
00:02:41.101 --> 00:02:45.450
<v Speaker 3>I think what's happening is the Muslim community that's in North America and</v>

112
00:02:45.451 --> 00:02:45.901
<v Speaker 3>Canada,</v>

113
00:02:45.901 --> 00:02:46.630
<v Speaker 3>the United States,</v>

114
00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.660
<v Speaker 3>they're a little bit more progressive.</v>

115
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.960
<v Speaker 3>They're sort of going through what all of the other religious groups went</v>

116
00:02:51.961 --> 00:02:54.450
<v Speaker 3>through when they came here as they kind of have like,</v>

117
00:02:54.451 --> 00:02:54.511
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

118
00:02:54.511 --> 00:02:57.300
<v Speaker 3>the religion part is really more of an identity issue.</v>

119
00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.700
<v Speaker 3>They have broad beliefs like they'll believe in God,</v>

120
00:03:00.701 --> 00:03:02.770
<v Speaker 3>they'll believe with the stick to some traditions.</v>

121
00:03:02.771 --> 00:03:03.770
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

122
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:05.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

123
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.580
<v Speaker 3>the large part of it,</v>

124
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.000
<v Speaker 3>like they're integrating pretty well and it's very different in Europe.</v>

125
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.620
<v Speaker 3>It seems sort of</v>

126
00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:12.111
<v Speaker 1>for like,</v>

127
00:03:12.111 --> 00:03:12.561
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

128
00:03:12.561 --> 00:03:16.580
<v Speaker 1>American Jews perhaps like a lot of American Jews are not really religious at</v>

129
00:03:16.581 --> 00:03:16.671
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

130
00:03:16.671 --> 00:03:19.190
<v Speaker 1>Like I have a lot of friends that will call themselves Jus,</v>

131
00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.700
<v Speaker 1>like my friend Ari Shaffir,</v>

132
00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.040
<v Speaker 1>clearly an atheist,</v>

133
00:03:22.041 --> 00:03:23.540
<v Speaker 1>but yet if you talk to him,</v>

134
00:03:23.541 --> 00:03:24.500
<v Speaker 1>he'll tell you he's a Jew.</v>

135
00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:25.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

136
00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:26.660
<v Speaker 1>And there's that.</v>

137
00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.280
<v Speaker 1>That was kind of.</v>

138
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

139
00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:32.320
<v Speaker 3>The idea of the title of the book is it's a job that the cherry picking thing.</v>

140
00:03:33.261 --> 00:03:35.600
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking if you could cherry pick up,</v>

141
00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.400
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be a feminist Muslim and lgbt Muslim if you.</v>

142
00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.610
<v Speaker 3>I can cherry pick all.</v>

143
00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.330
<v Speaker 3>I can cherry pick all the way to non belief.</v>

144
00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:45.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

145
00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:46.850
<v Speaker 3>I'll keep the things I like,</v>

146
00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.451
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

147
00:03:47.451 --> 00:03:48.284
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

148
00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.720
<v Speaker 3>like I love the Ramadan feasts.</v>

149
00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:50.563
<v Speaker 3>I grew up with that.</v>

150
00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:51.703
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

151
00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.251
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

152
00:03:52.251 --> 00:03:52.490
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

153
00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:53.900
<v Speaker 3>it's just very communal.</v>

154
00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:55.160
<v Speaker 3>Families get together.</v>

155
00:03:55.161 --> 00:03:55.551
<v Speaker 3>It's great.</v>

156
00:03:55.551 --> 00:03:57.110
<v Speaker 3>The IED holidays are great.</v>

157
00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.630
<v Speaker 3>I'm tax exempt status.</v>

158
00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:00.310
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

159
00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:01.150
<v Speaker 1>why not keep that.</v>

160
00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:06.010
<v Speaker 1>But what can you only have tax exempt status if you operate a religion though,</v>

161
00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.870
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

162
00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:07.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

163
00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.943
<v Speaker 1>I'm kidding about that.</v>

164
00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.460
<v Speaker 1>You can have to operate your own church.</v>

165
00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:10.463
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

166
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.570
<v Speaker 3>I probably won't be doing that anytime soon.</v>

167
00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.210
<v Speaker 1>You can do it if you want to.</v>

168
00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:15.920
<v Speaker 1>My friend Alex Grey does that.</v>

169
00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:16.731
<v Speaker 1>Our friend Alex,</v>

170
00:04:16.731 --> 00:04:17.564
<v Speaker 1>the painter,</v>

171
00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.740
<v Speaker 1>he's this amazing psychedelic artist and he has this,</v>

172
00:04:21.741 --> 00:04:22.370
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

173
00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.530
<v Speaker 1>this organization called the chapel of the sacred mirrors and uh,</v>

174
00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.580
<v Speaker 1>what he's essentially does is,</v>

175
00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.620
<v Speaker 1>has done rather is create his own religion and he has tax exempt status.</v>

176
00:04:33.621 --> 00:04:34.670
<v Speaker 1>Although his is,</v>

177
00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.870
<v Speaker 1>I think that not like the state recognizes it,</v>

178
00:04:38.871 --> 00:04:43.130
<v Speaker 1>but his town doesn't want to recognize that they want like local taxes.</v>

179
00:04:43.131 --> 00:04:47.780
<v Speaker 1>And it's very interesting because people are cool with religions as long as</v>

180
00:04:47.781 --> 00:04:48.890
<v Speaker 1>they're really old,</v>

181
00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:50.060
<v Speaker 1>as long as they're,</v>

182
00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.570
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

183
00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:52.730
<v Speaker 1>as soon as you know who made the religion,</v>

184
00:04:52.731 --> 00:04:56.330
<v Speaker 1>whether it's even mormonism gets looked down upon because Joseph Smith,</v>

185
00:04:56.331 --> 00:04:57.860
<v Speaker 1>although he lived in the 18 hundreds,</v>

186
00:04:57.861 --> 00:04:58.311
<v Speaker 1>everybody,</v>

187
00:04:58.311 --> 00:05:00.380
<v Speaker 1>there's a historical record of Joseph Smith.</v>

188
00:05:00.381 --> 00:05:02.780
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty easy to track.</v>

189
00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:03.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

190
00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.910
<v Speaker 1>Whereas,</v>

191
00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:04.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

192
00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:09.350
<v Speaker 1>scientology is the most made fun of and that is by a science fiction writer in</v>

193
00:05:09.351 --> 00:05:10.400
<v Speaker 1>the 19 fifties.</v>

194
00:05:10.401 --> 00:05:11.600
<v Speaker 1>It's the easiest to track.</v>

195
00:05:11.601 --> 00:05:11.990
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

196
00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.860
<v Speaker 1>it's right there.</v>

197
00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:14.270
<v Speaker 1>Anything newer than that,</v>

198
00:05:14.271 --> 00:05:14.541
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

199
00:05:14.541 --> 00:05:14.841
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>

200
00:05:14.841 --> 00:05:15.800
<v Speaker 1>get the fuck Outta here.</v>

201
00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.170
<v Speaker 3>I know you wouldn't believe it.</v>

202
00:05:17.171 --> 00:05:18.420
<v Speaker 3>And even though it's older religions,</v>

203
00:05:18.421 --> 00:05:19.111
<v Speaker 3>if you brought them back,</v>

204
00:05:19.111 --> 00:05:20.250
<v Speaker 3>if they started recently,</v>

205
00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:21.430
<v Speaker 3>some of the,</v>

206
00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:22.030
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

207
00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:22.530
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

208
00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:22.801
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

209
00:05:22.801 --> 00:05:25.230
<v Speaker 3>when religious people make fun of scientology and what isn't,</v>

210
00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:27.150
<v Speaker 3>it's always entertaining because,</v>

211
00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:28.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

212
00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:29.461
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about like,</v>

213
00:05:29.461 --> 00:05:29.840
<v Speaker 3>well yeah,</v>

214
00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.370
<v Speaker 3>Angel was a real and virgin births really happened,</v>

215
00:05:32.371 --> 00:05:34.080
<v Speaker 3>but like this fucking Mormon.</v>

216
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.833
<v Speaker 3>So it's uh,</v>

217
00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:38.220
<v Speaker 3>I know it's,</v>

218
00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.350
<v Speaker 3>it's Kinda funny when you look at it,</v>

219
00:05:40.351 --> 00:05:44.700
<v Speaker 3>I think I saw this comic where there were these two religious groups fighting.</v>

220
00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:48.960
<v Speaker 3>They're running against each other and swords and one of them was screaming,</v>

221
00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:50.220
<v Speaker 3>two plus two equals five.</v>

222
00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.110
<v Speaker 3>The other one was saying two plus two equals three.</v>

223
00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.060
<v Speaker 3>And then we about to fight about it.</v>

224
00:05:54.061 --> 00:05:56.460
<v Speaker 3>And that's really what it's like sometimes when you look at it.</v>

225
00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:56.880
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

226
00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:57.770
<v Speaker 3>did see the,</v>

227
00:05:57.771 --> 00:05:58.400
<v Speaker 3>the anger</v>

228
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.910
<v Speaker 1>from the people that were upset at Neil Tyson,</v>

229
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.910
<v Speaker 1>Neil degrasse Tyson for tweeting about Isaac Newton,</v>

230
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:05.901
<v Speaker 1>Isaac Newton,</v>

231
00:06:05.901 --> 00:06:08.120
<v Speaker 1>who was born on December 25th.</v>

232
00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:09.360
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

233
00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:09.850
<v Speaker 1>there were,</v>

234
00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:11.960
<v Speaker 1>there was a Darwin or Newton that was born in December,</v>

235
00:06:11.961 --> 00:06:12.820
<v Speaker 1>25th Newton.</v>

236
00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:13.521
<v Speaker 1>Was it Newton?</v>

237
00:06:13.521 --> 00:06:14.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

238
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:15.050
<v Speaker 1>And he was,</v>

239
00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:16.730
<v Speaker 1>he was tweeting about,</v>

240
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

241
00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:22.430
<v Speaker 1>w w this great man being born on this great day and so many fucking religious</v>

242
00:06:23.301 --> 00:06:24.920
<v Speaker 1>people got really angry at him.</v>

243
00:06:24.921 --> 00:06:28.640
<v Speaker 1>Although he said nothing negative whatsoever about religion.</v>

244
00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:29.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

245
00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:29.611
<v Speaker 1>But they will,</v>

246
00:06:29.611 --> 00:06:29.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

247
00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:30.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

248
00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:31.520
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't on our holiday.</v>

249
00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:36.350
<v Speaker 1>And it to me sort of highlights what religion is for a lot of people.</v>

250
00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:36.810
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

251
00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:38.570
<v Speaker 1>it's a group that you belong to.</v>

252
00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:39.531
<v Speaker 1>It's a team.</v>

253
00:06:39.531 --> 00:06:41.150
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm a patriots fan,</v>

254
00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:41.871
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

255
00:06:41.871 --> 00:06:43.190
<v Speaker 1>don't fuck with our team.</v>

256
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.860
<v Speaker 1>And it really does become something like that.</v>

257
00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:51.130
<v Speaker 1>And when you're talking about American Jews or Muslims maybe perhaps that don't</v>

258
00:06:51.321 --> 00:06:54.410
<v Speaker 1>really follow all of what's in the Koran,</v>

259
00:06:54.411 --> 00:06:56.120
<v Speaker 1>they just decided to cherry pick.</v>

260
00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.460
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of a similar thing you're dealing with.</v>

261
00:06:58.461 --> 00:06:59.450
<v Speaker 1>It is a silhouette similar thing.</v>

262
00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:00.410
<v Speaker 1>That's probably a good thing.</v>

263
00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:00.621
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

264
00:07:00.621 --> 00:07:03.280
<v Speaker 1>that's how people sort of progress forwards,</v>

265
00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:03.680
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

266
00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:03.941
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

267
00:07:03.941 --> 00:07:04.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

268
00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean we're talking about Jews in the Old Testament is,</v>

269
00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:08.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

270
00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:11.900
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about killing gay people like leviticus 2013 says it,</v>

271
00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:12.471
<v Speaker 1>it says,</v>

272
00:07:12.471 --> 00:07:12.681
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

273
00:07:12.681 --> 00:07:14.480
<v Speaker 1>if there's two men and you find them,</v>

274
00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:15.091
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

275
00:07:15.091 --> 00:07:17.510
<v Speaker 1>together and the way that a man should be with a woman,</v>

276
00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:19.370
<v Speaker 1>then there'll be put to death.</v>

277
00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:20.570
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what it says.</v>

278
00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:23.450
<v Speaker 1>But most Jews don't really take that seriously.</v>

279
00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:24.760
<v Speaker 1>They have built beyond it.</v>

280
00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:25.520
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

281
00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:26.230
<v Speaker 1>even,</v>

282
00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:26.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

283
00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:27.400
<v Speaker 1>Christians,</v>

284
00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:27.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

285
00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:29.960
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I look at is Catholics.</v>

286
00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:34.880
<v Speaker 1>The pope says you should not use birth control or you know,</v>

287
00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:36.170
<v Speaker 1>abortion is a bad thing.</v>

288
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:37.790
<v Speaker 1>The majority of Catholics are there.</v>

289
00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:38.840
<v Speaker 1>Pro Choice,</v>

290
00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:39.111
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

291
00:07:39.111 --> 00:07:40.310
<v Speaker 1>they have premarital sex.</v>

292
00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:41.031
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

293
00:07:41.031 --> 00:07:41.780
<v Speaker 1>they are,</v>

294
00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:42.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

295
00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:46.190
<v Speaker 1>they're perfectly fine with all these things because the majority are pro choice</v>

296
00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:47.250
<v Speaker 1>over here in the U.</v>

297
00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:47.660
<v Speaker 1>S air.</v>

298
00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:48.493
<v Speaker 1>Is it the zero,</v>

299
00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:49.551
<v Speaker 1>like a statistic,</v>

300
00:07:49.551 --> 00:07:50.180
<v Speaker 1>the prove that.</v>

301
00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:50.331
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

302
00:07:50.331 --> 00:07:50.631
<v Speaker 1>there is.</v>

303
00:07:50.631 --> 00:07:51.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the exact number,</v>

304
00:07:51.561 --> 00:07:55.220
<v Speaker 1>but the majority of Catholics in the United States are actually pro choice.</v>

305
00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.680
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting because I would have not thought that was true.</v>

306
00:07:58.030 --> 00:07:58.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

307
00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:02.180
<v Speaker 1>I would have thought that it would probably be at the very least 50 slash 50,</v>

308
00:08:02.181 --> 00:08:05.920
<v Speaker 1>but at the very more likely skewing towards prolife.</v>

309
00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:06.610
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

310
00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:06.761
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

311
00:08:06.761 --> 00:08:07.281
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely.</v>

312
00:08:07.281 --> 00:08:11.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean there are pro choice and Joe Biden's a Catholic practicing Catholic and</v>

313
00:08:11.391 --> 00:08:12.290
<v Speaker 1>he's also pro choice.</v>

314
00:08:12.291 --> 00:08:13.820
<v Speaker 1>Big is also an idiot though</v>

315
00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:19.580
<v Speaker 1>when we were a comics back in the funniest.</v>

316
00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:20.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

317
00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:21.201
<v Speaker 1>he is.</v>

318
00:08:21.201 --> 00:08:21.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

319
00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:22.880
<v Speaker 1>Well people forget about this,</v>

320
00:08:22.881 --> 00:08:23.720
<v Speaker 1>about Joe Biden,</v>

321
00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:24.560
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

322
00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:25.393
<v Speaker 1>not to.</v>

323
00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.920
<v Speaker 1>Everybody makes mistakes and I'm sure it probably wasn't his fault,</v>

324
00:08:27.921 --> 00:08:29.120
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

325
00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:34.160
<v Speaker 1>in the 19 eighties he was running for president and he plagiarized a huge chunk</v>

326
00:08:34.161 --> 00:08:35.750
<v Speaker 1>of John f Kennedy's speeches.</v>

327
00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:36.111
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

328
00:08:36.111 --> 00:08:36.680
<v Speaker 1>he did.</v>

329
00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:41.680
<v Speaker 1>And we used to do Joe Biden tonight at stitches and Joe Biden night would be</v>

330
00:08:41.811 --> 00:08:42.140
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

331
00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:44.630
<v Speaker 1>we would all go up and try to remember each other's acts.</v>

332
00:08:44.631 --> 00:08:47.300
<v Speaker 1>Like I would try to do my friends act and he would try to do my act.</v>

333
00:08:47.301 --> 00:08:47.720
<v Speaker 1>We tried it,</v>

334
00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:48.920
<v Speaker 1>we'd steal each other's jokes.</v>

335
00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:52.610
<v Speaker 1>It was like an inside thing that we would do on open mic night.</v>

336
00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:53.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

337
00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:53.511
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

338
00:08:53.511 --> 00:08:53.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

339
00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:54.291
<v Speaker 1>this guy,</v>

340
00:08:54.291 --> 00:08:55.124
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

341
00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.090
<v Speaker 1>I forget who came up with the idea,</v>

342
00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.120
<v Speaker 1>but we would call it,</v>

343
00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.530
<v Speaker 1>he was such a known plagiarist that we would call it Joe Biden tonight.</v>

344
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:02.221
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

345
00:09:02.221 --> 00:09:02.641
<v Speaker 1>That kind of.</v>

346
00:09:02.641 --> 00:09:05.220
<v Speaker 1>I think that was one of the major things that killed his campaign.</v>

347
00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:06.030
<v Speaker 1>Not the only thing.</v>

348
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:06.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

349
00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:09.420
<v Speaker 1>But now he's the vice president and it's sort of never brought up.</v>

350
00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:10.351
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

351
00:09:10.351 --> 00:09:11.184
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

352
00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:12.390
<v Speaker 1>I think he's done.</v>

353
00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:15.240
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of stuff he's done that I think that kind of redeemed him,</v>

354
00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:16.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

355
00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:16.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm right.</v>

356
00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:20.160
<v Speaker 1>But how did that not come up when he was debating Sarah Pailin?</v>

357
00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:21.053
<v Speaker 1>It did.</v>

358
00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:22.620
<v Speaker 1>And it didn't come up during the debate,</v>

359
00:09:22.621 --> 00:09:23.790
<v Speaker 1>but during the campaign there were,</v>

360
00:09:23.791 --> 00:09:24.990
<v Speaker 1>people will try to bring it up,</v>

361
00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:27.050
<v Speaker 1>but I think that just,</v>

362
00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:31.530
<v Speaker 1>it had been so long and he had done so much more since then,</v>

363
00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:32.640
<v Speaker 1>like with foreign policy,</v>

364
00:09:32.641 --> 00:09:37.500
<v Speaker 1>with the violence against women legislation and so on that people were willing</v>

365
00:09:37.501 --> 00:09:39.150
<v Speaker 1>to let them get past.</v>

366
00:09:39.151 --> 00:09:41.490
<v Speaker 1>And he has a really strong personal story too that he,</v>

367
00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:42.703
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

368
00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:43.920
<v Speaker 1>emphasized.</v>

369
00:09:43.921 --> 00:09:45.000
<v Speaker 1>And so I think,</v>

370
00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:45.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

371
00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:47.100
<v Speaker 1>he was able to move past that.</v>

372
00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:51.090
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting because a lot of times things like that are real career killers</v>

373
00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.880
<v Speaker 1>and it was as far as like him being the actual president,</v>

374
00:09:53.881 --> 00:09:54.714
<v Speaker 1>president,</v>

375
00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.820
<v Speaker 1>like when people talk about Hillary running for president,</v>

376
00:09:57.090 --> 00:09:59.370
<v Speaker 1>no one's talking about Joe Biden run for president.</v>

377
00:09:59.371 --> 00:10:01.350
<v Speaker 1>If you noticed that like no one,</v>

378
00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:02.290
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

379
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:03.600
<v Speaker 1>Was he running for president?</v>

380
00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:04.763
<v Speaker 1>He's not right,</v>

381
00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:08.760
<v Speaker 1>but he's the vice president for eight fucking years and no one hates him.</v>

382
00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:09.290
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

383
00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:11.760
<v Speaker 1>it's not like he's Dan quayle where everybody's like,</v>

384
00:10:11.761 --> 00:10:13.590
<v Speaker 1>get that fucking moron out of office.</v>

385
00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:13.770
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

386
00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:14.730
<v Speaker 1>he never did.</v>

387
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:16.170
<v Speaker 1>Like even in the other campaigns,</v>

388
00:10:16.171 --> 00:10:17.010
<v Speaker 1>whenever he's run,</v>

389
00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:19.470
<v Speaker 1>he never really did too well.</v>

390
00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:20.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was,</v>

391
00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:24.270
<v Speaker 1>he was running against Obama to back into it and then Obama chosen was vice</v>

392
00:10:24.271 --> 00:10:24.601
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>

393
00:10:24.601 --> 00:10:25.130
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

394
00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:26.910
<v Speaker 1>I think he was always in the single digits.</v>

395
00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:27.571
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

396
00:10:27.571 --> 00:10:29.430
<v Speaker 1>But I mean he is the vice president.</v>

397
00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:29.881
<v Speaker 1>He is.</v>

398
00:10:29.881 --> 00:10:34.410
<v Speaker 1>I think that that would be like a prime candidate to keep the Democrats in a</v>

399
00:10:34.411 --> 00:10:35.400
<v Speaker 1>position of power,</v>

400
00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:38.010
<v Speaker 1>but now they're looking towards a woman instead.</v>

401
00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:38.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

402
00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:38.861
<v Speaker 1>Like Dude,</v>

403
00:10:38.861 --> 00:10:39.780
<v Speaker 1>you're a liability.</v>

404
00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:42.690
<v Speaker 1>It was like Dick Cheney,</v>

405
00:10:42.691 --> 00:10:42.870
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

406
00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:43.920
<v Speaker 1>He was vice president,</v>

407
00:10:43.921 --> 00:10:46.620
<v Speaker 1>but there's no fucking way he's going to.</v>

408
00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:50.670
<v Speaker 1>He's probably the most hated vice president ever.</v>

409
00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:51.870
<v Speaker 1>Dick Cheney,</v>

410
00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:53.520
<v Speaker 1>like the most despised,</v>

411
00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:55.830
<v Speaker 1>like there's some people that supported him for sure,</v>

412
00:10:55.831 --> 00:10:58.930
<v Speaker 1>but the people that hated him really fucking hated it.</v>

413
00:10:58.940 --> 00:10:59.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

414
00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:00.020
<v Speaker 1>they did.</v>

415
00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:01.470
<v Speaker 1>It was just such a money trail,</v>

416
00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:02.011
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

417
00:11:02.011 --> 00:11:04.740
<v Speaker 1>pointing him directly to Halliburton and all the,</v>

418
00:11:04.741 --> 00:11:05.191
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

419
00:11:05.191 --> 00:11:07.950
<v Speaker 1>the weapons of mass destruction fiasco and all that shit.</v>

420
00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:11.130
<v Speaker 1>I just think he just seems really dodgy to me.</v>

421
00:11:11.131 --> 00:11:14.580
<v Speaker 1>Like I always feel like there's something under the surface that's just really</v>

422
00:11:14.581 --> 00:11:15.960
<v Speaker 1>explosive and evil.</v>

423
00:11:15.961 --> 00:11:17.190
<v Speaker 1>Like he comes across that way.</v>

424
00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:17.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

425
00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:21.120
<v Speaker 1>He's definitely doesn't come across warm and compassionate and interesting.</v>

426
00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:22.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

427
00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:24.180
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to understand a guy like that.</v>

428
00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:28.770
<v Speaker 1>Especially a guy that's gone through some serious health issues and he does.</v>

429
00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:31.140
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't seem to have more heart attacks,</v>

430
00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:32.970
<v Speaker 1>so we got a new heart.</v>

431
00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:33.470
<v Speaker 1>He's a.</v>

432
00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:34.740
<v Speaker 1>He had a heart transplant,</v>

433
00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:36.060
<v Speaker 1>which is insane.</v>

434
00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:36.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

435
00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:37.860
<v Speaker 1>Before the heart transplant,</v>

436
00:11:37.861 --> 00:11:42.270
<v Speaker 1>he had some sort of a device that eliminated his pulse.</v>

437
00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:43.710
<v Speaker 1>He didn't have a pulse.</v>

438
00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:48.540
<v Speaker 1>There was some artificial method of pumping blood through his body and if you</v>

439
00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:49.500
<v Speaker 1>checked his pulse,</v>

440
00:11:49.501 --> 00:11:50.460
<v Speaker 1>he didn't exist,</v>

441
00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:53.040
<v Speaker 1>which is probably in the Bible somewhere,</v>

442
00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:53.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

443
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:56.320
<v Speaker 1>a guy who was the death of millions.</v>

444
00:11:56.321 --> 00:11:56.531
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

445
00:11:56.531 --> 00:12:01.531
<v Speaker 1>he's directly connected to the death of at least a million people and he doesn't</v>

446
00:12:01.691 --> 00:12:02.524
<v Speaker 1>have a pulse.</v>

447
00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:04.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

448
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:04.833
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

449
00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:06.200
<v Speaker 3>that's dark shit.</v>

450
00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:06.441
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

451
00:12:06.441 --> 00:12:08.120
<v Speaker 3>That's a hell of a way to articulate it,</v>

452
00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:09.013
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

453
00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:09.860
<v Speaker 3>if it's accurate,</v>

454
00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:10.693
<v Speaker 3>it's accurate.</v>

455
00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:13.640
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how we got on this.</v>

456
00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:17.400
<v Speaker 1>What we're talking about is people that are in groups.</v>

457
00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:18.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's,</v>

458
00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:18.470
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

459
00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:22.800
<v Speaker 1>there's good things involved in being a group because it gives you some support</v>

460
00:12:22.801 --> 00:12:27.801
<v Speaker 1>and it gives you some feeling of comradery and belong to a social structure.</v>

461
00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:30.730
<v Speaker 1>But it's the.</v>

462
00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:35.750
<v Speaker 1>The real issue though is groups against other groups diametrically opposed</v>

463
00:12:35.971 --> 00:12:36.804
<v Speaker 1>groups like,</v>

464
00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:41.760
<v Speaker 1>like right now being a Muslim is a very unpopular thing in a lot of parts of the</v>

465
00:12:41.761 --> 00:12:42.530
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

466
00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:44.250
<v Speaker 1>The Charlie Hebdo thing,</v>

467
00:12:44.251 --> 00:12:48.930
<v Speaker 1>this most recent isis video where they burned the Jordanian pilot ally.</v>

468
00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:52.590
<v Speaker 1>That was just kind of shaking for hours.</v>

469
00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:53.910
<v Speaker 1>I didn't watch it.</v>

470
00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:54.871
<v Speaker 1>I didn't watch it either.</v>

471
00:12:54.871 --> 00:12:57.150
<v Speaker 1>I've seen it all at this point.</v>

472
00:12:57.151 --> 00:12:58.080
<v Speaker 1>I know what it looks like.</v>

473
00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:01.440
<v Speaker 1>I've seen the beheadings and the assassinations and it's just like,</v>

474
00:13:01.441 --> 00:13:02.274
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

475
00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:03.323
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

476
00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.410
<v Speaker 1>There's evil people.</v>

477
00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:04.981
<v Speaker 1>I get it,</v>

478
00:13:04.981 --> 00:13:06.090
<v Speaker 1>but it's just like this.</v>

479
00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.170
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like it's.</v>

480
00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:10.470
<v Speaker 1>If you were a conspiratorially minded person,</v>

481
00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:14.310
<v Speaker 1>if you're the type of person that believes black helicopters were circling your</v>

482
00:13:14.311 --> 00:13:15.030
<v Speaker 1>house everyday,</v>

483
00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:17.800
<v Speaker 1>taking scans of your phone and you.</v>

484
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:18.833
<v Speaker 1>I am,</v>

485
00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:21.270
<v Speaker 1>you would say,</v>

486
00:13:21.271 --> 00:13:22.104
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

487
00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:27.170
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like we're creating this monster that so unbelievably horrific and</v>

488
00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:32.440
<v Speaker 1>so impossible to to,</v>

489
00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:34.580
<v Speaker 1>to feel any sympathy towards that.</v>

490
00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:35.261
<v Speaker 1>It's like you,</v>

491
00:13:35.261 --> 00:13:35.460
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

492
00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:35.730
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

493
00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:36.060
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

494
00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:38.460
<v Speaker 1>you want them all wiped off the face of the planet.</v>

495
00:13:38.461 --> 00:13:41.790
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like they have become this so they're,</v>

496
00:13:41.791 --> 00:13:46.500
<v Speaker 1>they're so evil in their acts are so horrendous that like,</v>

497
00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:50.730
<v Speaker 1>it's the perfect instigating weapon like,</v>

498
00:13:50.731 --> 00:13:54.170
<v Speaker 1>or the perfect perfect method of instigation that if you wanted to,</v>

499
00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:59.360
<v Speaker 1>if you were like an evil dictator or the evil head of some sort of government</v>

500
00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:03.060
<v Speaker 1>and you had this desire to go to war with another country,</v>

501
00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:06.090
<v Speaker 1>like what you would create would be isis.</v>

502
00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:06.871
<v Speaker 1>You would say,</v>

503
00:14:06.871 --> 00:14:07.140
<v Speaker 1>alright,</v>

504
00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:08.400
<v Speaker 1>we need some bullshit.</v>

505
00:14:08.401 --> 00:14:09.900
<v Speaker 1>CIA propped up,</v>

506
00:14:09.901 --> 00:14:11.100
<v Speaker 1>organization doesn't,</v>

507
00:14:11.101 --> 00:14:14.790
<v Speaker 1>it's not real and we need them to be just so heinous.</v>

508
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.000
<v Speaker 1>So beyond belief that everyone agrees we should go over there and fuck them up.</v>

509
00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:21.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

510
00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:22.840
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>

511
00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:24.310
<v Speaker 3>I totally see the logic of that.</v>

512
00:14:24.311 --> 00:14:25.510
<v Speaker 3>I don't obviously,</v>

513
00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:26.650
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that's the case.</v>

514
00:14:26.651 --> 00:14:27.880
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that's the case either,</v>

515
00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:30.130
<v Speaker 3>but if it was going to be the case,</v>

516
00:14:30.131 --> 00:14:32.410
<v Speaker 3>like isis is like the perfect candidate.</v>

517
00:14:32.411 --> 00:14:32.531
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

518
00:14:32.531 --> 00:14:33.341
<v Speaker 3>it's a prototype.</v>

519
00:14:33.341 --> 00:14:35.260
<v Speaker 3>It's like that's exactly what you'd want.</v>

520
00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:35.461
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

521
00:14:35.461 --> 00:14:36.790
<v Speaker 3>It's like right in a Hollywood casting,</v>

522
00:14:36.791 --> 00:14:37.091
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

523
00:14:37.091 --> 00:14:37.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

524
00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:37.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

525
00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:38.711
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

526
00:14:38.711 --> 00:14:39.544
<v Speaker 3>what's a,</v>

527
00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:42.530
<v Speaker 3>like this whole idea that they're a fringe and you know,</v>

528
00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:44.140
<v Speaker 3>that they don't have a lot of support.</v>

529
00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:45.580
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

530
00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:46.810
<v Speaker 3>it is one thing that yes,</v>

531
00:14:46.811 --> 00:14:48.460
<v Speaker 3>they don't represent all Muslims,</v>

532
00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:49.660
<v Speaker 3>like they don't even represent,</v>

533
00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:50.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

534
00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:51.350
<v Speaker 3>the majority of Muslims and everything.</v>

535
00:14:51.351 --> 00:14:52.420
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

536
00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:56.180
<v Speaker 3>unfortunately like I think they have a lot more support than we'd like to</v>

537
00:14:56.181 --> 00:14:56.890
<v Speaker 3>believe.</v>

538
00:14:56.890 --> 00:15:00.090
<v Speaker 3>Everybody who comes out and says that know there's just like a frame,</v>

539
00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:00.690
<v Speaker 3>just a,</v>

540
00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:01.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

541
00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:04.430
<v Speaker 3>group of guys who are doing this stuff and nobody really follows them.</v>

542
00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:05.390
<v Speaker 3>That's not true.</v>

543
00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:06.081
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

544
00:15:06.081 --> 00:15:08.180
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of support and may you see it online,</v>

545
00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:08.511
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

546
00:15:08.511 --> 00:15:11.960
<v Speaker 3>I've talked to people online impact Stan who totally supportive isis.</v>

547
00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:13.273
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

548
00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:14.960
<v Speaker 3>it's a bizarre,</v>

549
00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:15.591
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

550
00:15:15.591 --> 00:15:16.040
<v Speaker 3>they are like,</v>

551
00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:18.170
<v Speaker 3>they won't go out and commit those acts themselves,</v>

552
00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:20.690
<v Speaker 3>but they will definitely share it on.</v>

553
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:21.291
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

554
00:15:21.291 --> 00:15:24.680
<v Speaker 3>I'd follow some people online that are in Isis.</v>

555
00:15:24.681 --> 00:15:26.090
<v Speaker 3>I follow their twitter accounts.</v>

556
00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:26.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

557
00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:26.841
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

558
00:15:26.841 --> 00:15:27.890
<v Speaker 3>I don't follow them.</v>

559
00:15:27.891 --> 00:15:30.230
<v Speaker 3>So like they know I'm falling on a farm,</v>

560
00:15:30.231 --> 00:15:32.720
<v Speaker 3>so I bookmark their twitter page and I go back to it.</v>

561
00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:33.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

562
00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:34.430
<v Speaker 3>I'm sneaky like that.</v>

563
00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:37.010
<v Speaker 3>But I mean,</v>

564
00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:38.660
<v Speaker 3>I hate to say this,</v>

565
00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:42.170
<v Speaker 3>but they do occasionally have good points.</v>

566
00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:43.850
<v Speaker 3>And one of the good points was they,</v>

567
00:15:43.851 --> 00:15:45.830
<v Speaker 3>after they beheaded one of these guys,</v>

568
00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:47.360
<v Speaker 3>I forget which guy was,</v>

569
00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:49.820
<v Speaker 3>I think it was a journalist that got beheaded over there.</v>

570
00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:51.500
<v Speaker 3>It was one of the American guys.</v>

571
00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:52.990
<v Speaker 3>They beheaded the,</v>

572
00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:58.080
<v Speaker 3>this guy wrote one guy loses a body part and everyone goes crazy,</v>

573
00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:04.660
<v Speaker 3>but thousands of people lose their entire lives and no one blinks an eye like</v>

574
00:16:06.381 --> 00:16:06.860
<v Speaker 3>thousands.</v>

575
00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:10.220
<v Speaker 3>I think the way you said it is thousands of people's bodies are blown to bits</v>

576
00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:10.940
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

577
00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:12.290
<v Speaker 3>and no one blinks an eye.</v>

578
00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:13.011
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

579
00:16:13.011 --> 00:16:15.050
<v Speaker 3>that's a tough thing to argue against it.</v>

580
00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:15.933
<v Speaker 3>That's what,</v>

581
00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:17.690
<v Speaker 3>whenever this kind of thing happens,</v>

582
00:16:17.691 --> 00:16:18.600
<v Speaker 3>you always have a,</v>

583
00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:19.221
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

584
00:16:19.221 --> 00:16:22.310
<v Speaker 3>the sort of Noam Chomsky or kind of,</v>

585
00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:23.020
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

586
00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:24.440
<v Speaker 3>sort of mindset or you know,</v>

587
00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:28.250
<v Speaker 3>what he thinks is that you've got us on this side and we're doing all these</v>

588
00:16:28.251 --> 00:16:30.860
<v Speaker 3>terrible things and you've got them and they're doing these terrible things.</v>

589
00:16:30.861 --> 00:16:31.694
<v Speaker 3>What's the difference?</v>

590
00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:33.411
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

591
00:16:33.411 --> 00:16:34.820
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's as simple as that.</v>

592
00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:35.121
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

593
00:16:35.121 --> 00:16:36.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that,</v>

594
00:16:36.051 --> 00:16:36.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

595
00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:40.760
<v Speaker 3>everything that the US is doing is great and defending all aspects of American</v>

596
00:16:40.761 --> 00:16:41.594
<v Speaker 3>foreign policy.</v>

597
00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:45.050
<v Speaker 3>But if you're going to have that balance,</v>

598
00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:48.650
<v Speaker 3>you got to a sort of level the competition.</v>

599
00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:49.460
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

600
00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:49.671
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

601
00:16:49.671 --> 00:16:50.720
<v Speaker 3>the US has this,</v>

602
00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:51.830
<v Speaker 3>the biggest,</v>

603
00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:54.470
<v Speaker 3>strongest military in the world got loads of nuclear weapons.</v>

604
00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:55.330
<v Speaker 3>So on,</v>

605
00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:57.320
<v Speaker 3>like if isis had all of that,</v>

606
00:16:57.530 --> 00:16:59.300
<v Speaker 3>how bad would they be and what would they do?</v>

607
00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:04.570
<v Speaker 3>That's when you really sort of get an idea of the intentions and intentions</v>

608
00:17:04.671 --> 00:17:05.260
<v Speaker 3>matter.</v>

609
00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:06.093
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

610
00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:07.580
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

611
00:17:07.581 --> 00:17:07.831
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

612
00:17:07.831 --> 00:17:11.570
<v Speaker 3>they do what they can and they go all out and they,</v>

613
00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:12.980
<v Speaker 3>I think that,</v>

614
00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:14.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

615
00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:15.950
<v Speaker 3>like the [inaudible] that they killed,</v>

616
00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:16.880
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

617
00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:18.670
<v Speaker 3>Or the Christians that they're killing in Mosul,</v>

618
00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:22.490
<v Speaker 3>the poor people that the women in the gay people that throwing off buildings and</v>

619
00:17:22.491 --> 00:17:22.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

620
00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:24.590
<v Speaker 3>crucifying and stoning to death.</v>

621
00:17:24.591 --> 00:17:24.740
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

622
00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:27.230
<v Speaker 3>these are not people who are oil hungry,</v>

623
00:17:27.231 --> 00:17:31.040
<v Speaker 3>they're not people who have been sort of invading their lands or anything like</v>

624
00:17:31.041 --> 00:17:31.270
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

625
00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:31.670
<v Speaker 3>These are,</v>

626
00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:32.810
<v Speaker 3>these people have nothing to do with it.</v>

627
00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:35.610
<v Speaker 3>They just have some of their crimes that they're just Shia.</v>

628
00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:40.810
<v Speaker 3>They have a different belief in a different strain of Islam or their PA states,</v>

629
00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:41.781
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

630
00:17:41.781 --> 00:17:42.470
<v Speaker 3>they left Islam,</v>

631
00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:44.870
<v Speaker 3>they changed their mind or they're,</v>

632
00:17:44.871 --> 00:17:45.201
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

633
00:17:45.201 --> 00:17:45.861
<v Speaker 3>they're a Christian,</v>

634
00:17:45.861 --> 00:17:50.430
<v Speaker 3>they're non Muslims are infidels who are not going to subscribe to the,</v>

635
00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:50.701
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

636
00:17:50.701 --> 00:17:51.870
<v Speaker 3>the Isis philosophy.</v>

637
00:17:51.871 --> 00:17:53.100
<v Speaker 3>They're not going to pay that tax,</v>

638
00:17:53.101 --> 00:17:54.660
<v Speaker 3>that Jessia that they want them to pay.</v>

639
00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:56.070
<v Speaker 3>So like,</v>

640
00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:56.933
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

641
00:17:57.330 --> 00:18:01.980
<v Speaker 3>I think that the foreign policy thing is an excuse specifically for people like</v>

642
00:18:01.981 --> 00:18:02.814
<v Speaker 3>Isis.</v>

643
00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:03.811
<v Speaker 3>It is like,</v>

644
00:18:03.811 --> 00:18:06.210
<v Speaker 3>it helps them recruit people for sure.</v>

645
00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:07.453
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

646
00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:08.363
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't hurt,</v>

647
00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:09.510
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

648
00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:09.810
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

649
00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:11.970
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that that's the primary motive.</v>

650
00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:13.830
<v Speaker 3>What do you think the primary motive is?</v>

651
00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:16.080
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a lot of primary motives.</v>

652
00:18:16.081 --> 00:18:16.321
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

653
00:18:16.321 --> 00:18:16.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

654
00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:18.450
<v Speaker 3>like the US foreign policy is one thing too,</v>

655
00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:21.230
<v Speaker 3>but this is actually part of their religious belief.</v>

656
00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:22.410
<v Speaker 3>You've had Sam Harris here,</v>

657
00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:26.730
<v Speaker 3>he's talked about this as well as the beliefs and behavior and most of the time</v>

658
00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:29.550
<v Speaker 3>when they're in here,</v>

659
00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:32.320
<v Speaker 3>when you have an entire world and you're seeing these guys in there,</v>

660
00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:33.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

661
00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:34.500
<v Speaker 3>accurately quoting the Koran.</v>

662
00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:35.101
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

663
00:18:35.101 --> 00:18:37.950
<v Speaker 3>there's a couple of verses in the Koran say behead disbelievers,</v>

664
00:18:37.951 --> 00:18:38.161
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

665
00:18:38.161 --> 00:18:38.401
<v Speaker 3>eight,</v>

666
00:18:38.401 --> 00:18:39.234
<v Speaker 3>12,</v>

667
00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:39.631
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

668
00:18:39.631 --> 00:18:40.680
<v Speaker 3>you can google that,</v>

669
00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:43.020
<v Speaker 3>like Sera eight verse 12 and 13,</v>

670
00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:44.641
<v Speaker 3>47.</v>

671
00:18:44.641 --> 00:18:45.960
<v Speaker 3>Four is another one says,</v>

672
00:18:45.961 --> 00:18:46.111
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

673
00:18:46.111 --> 00:18:47.010
<v Speaker 3>bighead disbelievers.</v>

674
00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:52.370
<v Speaker 3>So they actually quote this stuff and they say Allahu Akbar when they do it and</v>

675
00:18:52.861 --> 00:18:54.420
<v Speaker 3>they called themselves the Islamic state.</v>

676
00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:56.010
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

677
00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:56.270
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

678
00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:57.960
<v Speaker 3>and they don't just target,</v>

679
00:18:58.620 --> 00:18:59.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

680
00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:00.960
<v Speaker 3>I'm sort of,</v>

681
00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:04.420
<v Speaker 3>people were involved in US foreign policy or anything like that.</v>

682
00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:07.860
<v Speaker 3>They actually target a poor people,</v>

683
00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:08.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

684
00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:10.080
<v Speaker 3>use minority groups.</v>

685
00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:11.303
<v Speaker 3>She is,</v>

686
00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:11.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

687
00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:14.700
<v Speaker 3>gay people who are in Iraq and Syria,</v>

688
00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:17.970
<v Speaker 3>that's what they do and this doesn't believe it.</v>

689
00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:19.140
<v Speaker 3>So it's a lot more complicated.</v>

690
00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:21.120
<v Speaker 3>I think that it is part of their religious belief.</v>

691
00:19:21.121 --> 00:19:24.150
<v Speaker 3>And one thing you need to see when you go to their twitter accounts is that they</v>

692
00:19:24.151 --> 00:19:25.980
<v Speaker 3>genuinely believe what they're doing is right.</v>

693
00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:32.320
<v Speaker 3>It's okay when you are supported by the religion that you've sworn allegiance to</v>

694
00:19:33.091 --> 00:19:35.820
<v Speaker 3>and sworn your life too when you're supported by the text.</v>

695
00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:36.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

696
00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:36.600
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

697
00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:37.200
<v Speaker 3>it really.</v>

698
00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:37.471
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

699
00:19:37.471 --> 00:19:40.950
<v Speaker 3>that's sometimes all you need to justify horrendous,</v>

700
00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:42.030
<v Speaker 3>horrible acts.</v>

701
00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:45.270
<v Speaker 3>You just need to know that you're doing it in the name of God.</v>

702
00:19:45.530 --> 00:19:45.780
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

703
00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:46.740
<v Speaker 3>that's the text.</v>

704
00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:48.330
<v Speaker 3>Is the religion in this case,</v>

705
00:19:48.331 --> 00:19:49.950
<v Speaker 3>like the one thing that's universal,</v>

706
00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:50.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

707
00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:52.950
<v Speaker 3>people say Muslims are not a monolith and they're not.</v>

708
00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:53.161
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

709
00:19:53.161 --> 00:19:55.200
<v Speaker 3>there's one point 6 billion Muslims in the world,</v>

710
00:19:55.201 --> 00:19:56.670
<v Speaker 3>so they're obviously not all the same.</v>

711
00:19:56.671 --> 00:19:57.810
<v Speaker 3>The ones in Indonesia,</v>

712
00:19:57.811 --> 00:19:58.321
<v Speaker 3>Turkey,</v>

713
00:19:58.321 --> 00:19:58.891
<v Speaker 3>Saudi Arabia,</v>

714
00:19:58.891 --> 00:20:00.270
<v Speaker 3>they're all very different from each other.</v>

715
00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:01.603
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

716
00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:06.060
<v Speaker 3>but the one thing they all have in common is the Koran and belief in the Prophet</v>

717
00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:06.270
<v Speaker 3>Muhammad.</v>

718
00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:07.103
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

719
00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:07.770
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

720
00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:09.430
<v Speaker 3>that the Quran again do,</v>

721
00:20:09.431 --> 00:20:09.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

722
00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:10.860
<v Speaker 3>has different interpretations,</v>

723
00:20:10.861 --> 00:20:15.861
<v Speaker 3>but it's supposed to be an immutable texts and unlike a lot of Christians and</v>

724
00:20:15.901 --> 00:20:17.130
<v Speaker 3>Jews who don't believe that,</v>

725
00:20:17.131 --> 00:20:17.964
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>

726
00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:19.133
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

727
00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:20.430
<v Speaker 3>like with Christianity,</v>

728
00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:23.700
<v Speaker 3>if you say that the Bible is a literal word of God,</v>

729
00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:24.841
<v Speaker 3>you're part of,</v>

730
00:20:24.841 --> 00:20:27.290
<v Speaker 3>I think 30 percent of the US population,</v>

731
00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:31.110
<v Speaker 3>I think it is 30 percent that is considered fundamentalists where they believe</v>

732
00:20:31.111 --> 00:20:34.810
<v Speaker 3>that it's a literal word of God in Islam,</v>

733
00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:37.140
<v Speaker 3>Muslims among the vast majority of Muslims.</v>

734
00:20:37.141 --> 00:20:41.730
<v Speaker 3>That is a fundamental requirement to believe that it is the literal word of God.</v>

735
00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:42.300
<v Speaker 3>Like the,</v>

736
00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:45.840
<v Speaker 3>the idea of scriptural inerrancy,</v>

737
00:20:46.290 --> 00:20:48.670
<v Speaker 3>that anything that's in Chron that kept it can't be wrong.</v>

738
00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:52.810
<v Speaker 3>So you'll have the more progressive people who try to justify it.</v>

739
00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:54.033
<v Speaker 3>They'll never say,</v>

740
00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:54.341
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

741
00:20:54.341 --> 00:20:54.671
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

742
00:20:54.671 --> 00:20:55.990
<v Speaker 3>that verse in the Koran,</v>

743
00:20:55.991 --> 00:20:57.160
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe in it.</v>

744
00:20:57.161 --> 00:20:58.150
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's right.</v>

745
00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:01.600
<v Speaker 3>They'll try to justify it by saying at that time it was okay,</v>

746
00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:06.190
<v Speaker 3>or it's being mistranslated or the word kill actually means embrace whatever it</v>

747
00:21:06.191 --> 00:21:06.990
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>

748
00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:07.631
<v Speaker 3>They look at the,</v>

749
00:21:07.631 --> 00:21:08.200
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

750
00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:08.921
<v Speaker 3>Arabic root.</v>

751
00:21:08.921 --> 00:21:09.490
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>

752
00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:10.323
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

753
00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:10.980
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

754
00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:11.813
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

755
00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:13.420
<v Speaker 3>find other justifications for it,</v>

756
00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:19.020
<v Speaker 3>but unfortunately to the rest of us who can read it and now you can google it in</v>

757
00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:24.480
<v Speaker 3>all kinds of different translations and interpretations and commentaries and</v>

758
00:21:25.271 --> 00:21:27.670
<v Speaker 3>you'd just find it online and when you see the words,</v>

759
00:21:27.671 --> 00:21:28.750
<v Speaker 3>the words are what they are.</v>

760
00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:35.000
<v Speaker 4>I want to be real clear here that I'm not justifying what they're doing or not</v>

761
00:21:35.001 --> 00:21:39.140
<v Speaker 4>trying to exonerate them from the nature of what their crimes are.</v>

762
00:21:39.141 --> 00:21:40.550
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>

763
00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:41.030
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

764
00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:41.200
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

765
00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:41.720
<v Speaker 4>what I'm,</v>

766
00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:43.880
<v Speaker 4>what I was going to get to was that,</v>

767
00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:46.310
<v Speaker 4>is that dissimilar,</v>

768
00:21:46.311 --> 00:21:50.540
<v Speaker 4>this belief that you can kill people because of the Koran because they're not</v>

769
00:21:50.541 --> 00:21:51.620
<v Speaker 4>following the word of the cross.</v>

770
00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:57.070
<v Speaker 4>Is that dissimilar than this belief that you can launch drones into these</v>

771
00:21:57.981 --> 00:22:00.170
<v Speaker 4>nonspecific areas where,</v>

772
00:22:00.171 --> 00:22:00.531
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

773
00:22:00.531 --> 00:22:04.610
<v Speaker 4>this idea of surgical targets is pretty preposterous at this point.</v>

774
00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:06.470
<v Speaker 4>When you look at the number of people,</v>

775
00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:09.500
<v Speaker 4>the overwhelming number of people that are innocent that are killed by drones</v>

776
00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:13.130
<v Speaker 4>versus the number of people that are guilty.</v>

777
00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:14.210
<v Speaker 4>If you,</v>

778
00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:19.210
<v Speaker 4>if you look at that and you look at this being sanctioned by the United States</v>

779
00:22:19.611 --> 00:22:20.211
<v Speaker 4>government,</v>

780
00:22:20.211 --> 00:22:21.410
<v Speaker 4>the constitution,</v>

781
00:22:21.411 --> 00:22:24.980
<v Speaker 4>our ideas about law and justice and war,</v>

782
00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:28.700
<v Speaker 4>those are also just things that are written down on paper.</v>

783
00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:29.241
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

784
00:22:29.241 --> 00:22:33.980
<v Speaker 4>they might be less ideologically based and more,</v>

785
00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:39.010
<v Speaker 4>more state based or more based on the idea of protecting our nation as opposed</v>

786
00:22:40.191 --> 00:22:42.050
<v Speaker 4>to doing the will of God.</v>

787
00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:44.690
<v Speaker 4>But it is one nation under God.</v>

788
00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:45.441
<v Speaker 4>Ultimately,</v>

789
00:22:45.441 --> 00:22:45.981
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>

790
00:22:45.981 --> 00:22:46.280
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

791
00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:50.350
<v Speaker 4>this is what we say when we pledge allegiance now since the 19 fifties,</v>

792
00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:52.340
<v Speaker 4>since they were worried about the big communist scare,</v>

793
00:22:52.670 --> 00:22:53.031
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

794
00:22:53.031 --> 00:22:56.990
<v Speaker 4>it used to be one nation indivisible with liberty and justice for all right?</v>

795
00:22:57.180 --> 00:22:57.390
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

796
00:22:57.390 --> 00:22:59.270
<v Speaker 4>Now it's one nation under God.</v>

797
00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:00.443
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

798
00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:02.360
<v Speaker 4>that was all because of communism.</v>

799
00:23:02.410 --> 00:23:02.660
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

800
00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:03.560
<v Speaker 4>that's when they didn't.</v>

801
00:23:03.561 --> 00:23:06.370
<v Speaker 4>And most folks don't even realize I wasn't even in there until the 1950.</v>

802
00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:07.840
<v Speaker 4>I was a reaction to like the,</v>

803
00:23:07.841 --> 00:23:08.130
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

804
00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:09.170
<v Speaker 4>the red scare.</v>

805
00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:11.103
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

806
00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:12.173
<v Speaker 4>but this,</v>

807
00:23:12.410 --> 00:23:14.000
<v Speaker 4>this is the justification,</v>

808
00:23:14.090 --> 00:23:17.240
<v Speaker 4>the horrific acts that are committed in,</v>

809
00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:18.050
<v Speaker 4>in war,</v>

810
00:23:18.050 --> 00:23:19.760
<v Speaker 4>nonspecific targets.</v>

811
00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:20.390
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

812
00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:21.770
<v Speaker 4>when I say nonspecific,</v>

813
00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:25.190
<v Speaker 4>obviously they're trying to get someone that's in a place,</v>

814
00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:25.941
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

815
00:23:25.941 --> 00:23:28.190
<v Speaker 4>when you're shooting a fucking missile where,</v>

816
00:23:28.191 --> 00:23:28.700
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

817
00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:30.260
<v Speaker 4>a guy's cell phone is,</v>

818
00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:32.540
<v Speaker 4>that's fairly nonspecific.</v>

819
00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:33.830
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

820
00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:34.460
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

821
00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:35.420
<v Speaker 4>relatively speaking,</v>

822
00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:37.100
<v Speaker 4>relatively spirit will look,</v>

823
00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:37.610
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

824
00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:38.391
<v Speaker 4>what are the numbers?</v>

825
00:23:38.391 --> 00:23:43.391
<v Speaker 4>I think the numbers of versus like the amount of casualties that are civilians,</v>

826
00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:46.130
<v Speaker 4>the actual people</v>

827
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:47.270
<v Speaker 3>that are to kill with drones.</v>

828
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:48.800
<v Speaker 3>It's something sane number.</v>

829
00:23:48.801 --> 00:23:50.840
<v Speaker 3>It's like more than 80 percent civilians.</v>

830
00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:51.380
<v Speaker 3>Here's,</v>

831
00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:53.060
<v Speaker 3>so the drone thing is a little,</v>

832
00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:53.570
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

833
00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:55.130
<v Speaker 3>it's also a complicated issue.</v>

834
00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:56.631
<v Speaker 3>There's this,</v>

835
00:23:56.631 --> 00:23:57.464
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

836
00:23:57.490 --> 00:23:58.031
<v Speaker 3>this writer,</v>

837
00:23:58.031 --> 00:23:59.390
<v Speaker 3>her name is Farhan Dodge.</v>

838
00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:00.380
<v Speaker 3>I mean she lives in Norway now,</v>

839
00:24:00.381 --> 00:24:01.460
<v Speaker 3>but she's from that area.</v>

840
00:24:01.461 --> 00:24:05.000
<v Speaker 3>She's from North Missouri stand where a lot of the drones were and she wrote</v>

841
00:24:05.001 --> 00:24:06.590
<v Speaker 3>this article a couple of years ago,</v>

842
00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:10.190
<v Speaker 3>I think it was in the daily times than Asian paper.</v>

843
00:24:10.191 --> 00:24:15.191
<v Speaker 3>And then what she talked about was a sort of the different groups that are in</v>

844
00:24:15.381 --> 00:24:17.990
<v Speaker 3>that area and like northwestern Pakistan,</v>

845
00:24:17.991 --> 00:24:19.250
<v Speaker 3>the Pak Afghan border.</v>

846
00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:22.370
<v Speaker 3>And she said that the locals over there a lot of times,</v>

847
00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:23.121
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

848
00:24:23.121 --> 00:24:23.291
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

849
00:24:23.291 --> 00:24:26.810
<v Speaker 3>they feel like they're caught between the Taliban that's sort of taken over the</v>

850
00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:27.703
<v Speaker 3>whole area and they,</v>

851
00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:28.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

852
00:24:28.050 --> 00:24:29.920
<v Speaker 3>they go out and they put a,</v>

853
00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:33.700
<v Speaker 3>they're shooting young girls in the head for going to school and they're,</v>

854
00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:33.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

855
00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:35.120
<v Speaker 3>doing all this other bullshit.</v>

856
00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:39.740
<v Speaker 3>And then on the other hand there is the Pakistani military and they're coming in</v>

857
00:24:39.741 --> 00:24:42.530
<v Speaker 3>with their planes and they're trying to bomb and that's even more nonspecific.</v>

858
00:24:42.531 --> 00:24:47.531
<v Speaker 3>So they feel a lot of them are actually in favor of it.</v>

859
00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:48.951
<v Speaker 3>Like there's many of them.</v>

860
00:24:48.951 --> 00:24:49.784
<v Speaker 3>That's what she said.</v>

861
00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:52.640
<v Speaker 3>So I don't know how true that is.</v>

862
00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:53.091
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

863
00:24:53.091 --> 00:24:53.571
<v Speaker 3>But I mean,</v>

864
00:24:53.571 --> 00:24:56.390
<v Speaker 3>it's definitely a plausible claim.</v>

865
00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:57.710
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

866
00:24:58.550 --> 00:24:59.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

867
00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:00.190
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of anecdotal doing,</v>

868
00:25:00.191 --> 00:25:00.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

869
00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:03.260
<v Speaker 3>one person saying a lot of them are in favor of it.</v>

870
00:25:03.261 --> 00:25:03.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

871
00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:03.930
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

872
00:25:03.930 --> 00:25:04.161
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

873
00:25:04.161 --> 00:25:05.660
<v Speaker 3>what happened was after she said this,</v>

874
00:25:05.661 --> 00:25:05.780
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

875
00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:09.080
<v Speaker 3>there were a lot of other accounts that came out that said the same kind of</v>

876
00:25:09.081 --> 00:25:09.410
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

877
00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:09.601
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

878
00:25:09.601 --> 00:25:09.690
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

879
00:25:09.690 --> 00:25:11.690
<v Speaker 3>they weren't saying that everybody's in favor of it.</v>

880
00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:16.070
<v Speaker 3>They're saying that it's not as clear cut as people think it is.</v>

881
00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:17.840
<v Speaker 3>So like with drones,</v>

882
00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:18.081
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

883
00:25:18.081 --> 00:25:18.501
<v Speaker 3>for instance,</v>

884
00:25:18.501 --> 00:25:20.930
<v Speaker 3>if you like the idea is that when you.</v>

885
00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:22.340
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

886
00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:22.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

887
00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:24.830
<v Speaker 3>these are decisions that are,</v>

888
00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:25.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

889
00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:26.960
<v Speaker 3>you got to choose between bad and worse,</v>

890
00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:31.370
<v Speaker 3>like complicated decisions are never clear cut,</v>

891
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:32.220
<v Speaker 3>good or bad.</v>

892
00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:32.960
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

893
00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:35.060
<v Speaker 3>So I don't like the drone strikes.</v>

894
00:25:35.061 --> 00:25:38.180
<v Speaker 3>I think it sucks that sometimes they're necessary,</v>

895
00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:40.910
<v Speaker 3>but unfortunately I think sometimes they aren't necessarily like these are</v>

896
00:25:40.911 --> 00:25:41.744
<v Speaker 3>people who are,</v>

897
00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:46.190
<v Speaker 3>if you have a sniper it was going around killing hundreds of people and you want</v>

898
00:25:46.191 --> 00:25:47.780
<v Speaker 3>to stop them and you know,</v>

899
00:25:47.781 --> 00:25:49.970
<v Speaker 3>he's around a place and you have a choice between,</v>

900
00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:50.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

901
00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:54.050
<v Speaker 3>targeting this guy and taking him out and that may kill a few civilians.</v>

902
00:25:54.051 --> 00:25:55.650
<v Speaker 3>Whereas if you don't do that,</v>

903
00:25:55.670 --> 00:25:56.600
<v Speaker 3>it'll go out and you know,</v>

904
00:25:56.730 --> 00:26:00.050
<v Speaker 3>he'll kill hundreds more people then and you,</v>

905
00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:01.070
<v Speaker 3>you're making that call.</v>

906
00:26:01.071 --> 00:26:02.630
<v Speaker 3>That's a really tough call to make.</v>

907
00:26:02.631 --> 00:26:03.650
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if I could do it,</v>

908
00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:04.401
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

909
00:26:04.401 --> 00:26:04.760
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

910
00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:05.680
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>

911
00:26:05.681 --> 00:26:06.050
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

912
00:26:06.050 --> 00:26:09.810
<v Speaker 3>when you're running countries and we know when you have a foreign policy,</v>

913
00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:10.160
<v Speaker 3>when you,</v>

914
00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:13.010
<v Speaker 3>when you have to do something about something that's happening,</v>

915
00:26:13.011 --> 00:26:17.090
<v Speaker 3>then it's a call that you have to make and it's a choice between bad and worse.</v>

916
00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:19.160
<v Speaker 3>It seems so intensely archaic,</v>

917
00:26:19.161 --> 00:26:19.910
<v Speaker 3>doesn't it?</v>

918
00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:20.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

919
00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:24.530
<v Speaker 3>Wasn't one of the articles that I pulled up was talking about an attempt to kill</v>

920
00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:28.790
<v Speaker 3>41 men result in the deaths of an estimated 1000,</v>

921
00:26:28.791 --> 00:26:30.860
<v Speaker 3>147 people.</v>

922
00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:36.880
<v Speaker 3>So the drones in their attempt to kill 41 different people have killed more than</v>

923
00:26:38.001 --> 00:26:38.930
<v Speaker 3>1000,</v>

924
00:26:38.931 --> 00:26:42.880
<v Speaker 3>147 people.</v>

925
00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:44.063
<v Speaker 3>That's just so.</v>

926
00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:45.343
<v Speaker 3>Well for her.</v>

927
00:26:45.490 --> 00:26:46.780
<v Speaker 3>She talked about this too.</v>

928
00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:48.020
<v Speaker 3>So she talked about the uh,</v>

929
00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:49.780
<v Speaker 3>like so in that area,</v>

930
00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:51.520
<v Speaker 3>nobody's allowed there.</v>

931
00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:51.821
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

932
00:26:51.821 --> 00:26:54.910
<v Speaker 3>So you're not like journalists don't go there because it's too dangerous.</v>

933
00:26:54.911 --> 00:26:55.600
<v Speaker 3>Even.</v>

934
00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:56.700
<v Speaker 3>What areas is that?</v>

935
00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:59.770
<v Speaker 3>This is in northern south was stan.</v>

936
00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:00.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

937
00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:00.551
<v Speaker 3>in Pakistan.</v>

938
00:27:00.551 --> 00:27:03.250
<v Speaker 3>Now the armies in there because they're fighting against them.</v>

939
00:27:03.251 --> 00:27:07.780
<v Speaker 3>Recently after the Taliban has been like really focusing all their attacks in</v>

940
00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:08.800
<v Speaker 3>within Pakistan,</v>

941
00:27:08.801 --> 00:27:10.210
<v Speaker 3>they have attacked the army school,</v>

942
00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:11.530
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

943
00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:13.000
<v Speaker 3>and killed all those kids and so on.</v>

944
00:27:13.270 --> 00:27:14.980
<v Speaker 3>So now they're in there.</v>

945
00:27:14.981 --> 00:27:17.410
<v Speaker 3>But before when a lot of these figures were coming out,</v>

946
00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:18.010
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

947
00:27:18.010 --> 00:27:18.970
<v Speaker 3>she said that,</v>

948
00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:19.291
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

949
00:27:19.291 --> 00:27:19.520
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

950
00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:19.920
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

951
00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:21.310
<v Speaker 3>there's no UN people,</v>

952
00:27:21.311 --> 00:27:22.810
<v Speaker 3>there's no independent sort of,</v>

953
00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:23.540
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

954
00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:24.090
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

955
00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:24.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

956
00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:26.650
<v Speaker 3>watchdogs or agencies that are looking at it.</v>

957
00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:28.090
<v Speaker 3>No journalist can go in there,</v>

958
00:27:28.091 --> 00:27:29.410
<v Speaker 3>no politicians can go in there.</v>

959
00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:30.401
<v Speaker 3>Even the police,</v>

960
00:27:30.401 --> 00:27:34.060
<v Speaker 3>the police are scared to go in there because it's just completely ruled by the</v>

961
00:27:34.061 --> 00:27:35.890
<v Speaker 3>Taliban and all these sort of militant elements.</v>

962
00:27:36.190 --> 00:27:38.420
<v Speaker 3>So a lot of these numbers,</v>

963
00:27:38.421 --> 00:27:39.254
<v Speaker 3>like if you look at the,</v>

964
00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:40.540
<v Speaker 3>I think it was a report,</v>

965
00:27:40.690 --> 00:27:43.200
<v Speaker 3>detailed report from Stanford and um,</v>

966
00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:48.370
<v Speaker 3>they talked about how these numbers were arrived at and there's a wide range.</v>

967
00:27:48.371 --> 00:27:49.990
<v Speaker 3>There's some people report their very low,</v>

968
00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:51.430
<v Speaker 3>other people report their very high.</v>

969
00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:54.820
<v Speaker 3>And that's not to say there haven't been civilian casualties.</v>

970
00:27:54.821 --> 00:27:55.654
<v Speaker 3>There have been,</v>

971
00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:57.400
<v Speaker 3>and that's terrible.</v>

972
00:27:57.820 --> 00:27:58.653
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

973
00:27:58.750 --> 00:28:02.410
<v Speaker 3>I think that during Bush's time when he just carried out a few drone strikes,</v>

974
00:28:02.411 --> 00:28:04.120
<v Speaker 3>they were relatively nonsurgical.</v>

975
00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:05.291
<v Speaker 3>I think Obama,</v>

976
00:28:05.291 --> 00:28:09.370
<v Speaker 3>one of the reason that he decided to go ahead and continue the drone strikes is</v>

977
00:28:09.371 --> 00:28:13.840
<v Speaker 3>that he founded the most surgical in the most accurate compared to all of the</v>

978
00:28:13.841 --> 00:28:14.980
<v Speaker 3>other options that they had.</v>

979
00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:17.070
<v Speaker 4>That's pretty scary when you think about.</v>

980
00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:17.520
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

981
00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:18.160
<v Speaker 4>it makes sense,</v>

982
00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:19.740
<v Speaker 4>bad choosing bad and worse.</v>

983
00:28:19.741 --> 00:28:20.280
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

984
00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:23.160
<v Speaker 4>But it makes sense when you look at the numbers of innocence that have been</v>

985
00:28:23.161 --> 00:28:24.210
<v Speaker 4>killed in the Iraq war.</v>

986
00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:24.700
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

987
00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:29.700
<v Speaker 4>Like mean mean it's arguable that it's close to a million dollars,</v>

988
00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:31.220
<v Speaker 4>a million humans rather than.</v>

989
00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:32.171
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's,</v>

990
00:28:32.171 --> 00:28:36.720
<v Speaker 4>that's an insane amount of innocent people that had been killed by feet on the</v>

991
00:28:36.721 --> 00:28:37.141
<v Speaker 4>ground,</v>

992
00:28:37.141 --> 00:28:37.830
<v Speaker 4>missiles,</v>

993
00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:38.850
<v Speaker 4>bombing campaigns,</v>

994
00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:39.763
<v Speaker 4>all of the above.</v>

995
00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:43.590
<v Speaker 4>And when you compare that to drone strikes,</v>

996
00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:45.020
<v Speaker 4>that's the only way,</v>

997
00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:46.380
<v Speaker 4>kind of like what they're saying.</v>

998
00:28:46.381 --> 00:28:49.080
<v Speaker 4>Like it's more surgical than that way.</v>

999
00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:49.681
<v Speaker 4>Then,</v>

1000
00:28:49.681 --> 00:28:49.951
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1001
00:28:49.951 --> 00:28:53.800
<v Speaker 4>sending a bunch of tanks and a bunch of troops into a,</v>

1002
00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:56.460
<v Speaker 4>an area that is less surgical.</v>

1003
00:28:56.890 --> 00:28:58.910
<v Speaker 4>So like what the fuck is war man?</v>

1004
00:28:59.440 --> 00:28:59.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1005
00:28:59.690 --> 00:29:01.520
<v Speaker 3>That's eventually come down to this that,</v>

1006
00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:01.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1007
00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:02.950
<v Speaker 3>wore socks and you know,</v>

1008
00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:04.100
<v Speaker 3>we're going to have that debate.</v>

1009
00:29:04.101 --> 00:29:05.180
<v Speaker 3>I will agree with you.</v>

1010
00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:06.650
<v Speaker 3>It's terrible when you can avoid it,</v>

1011
00:29:06.651 --> 00:29:07.484
<v Speaker 3>you can,</v>

1012
00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:12.580
<v Speaker 3>but if you're of the view that sometimes it is necessary to prevent even larger</v>

1013
00:29:14.301 --> 00:29:15.350
<v Speaker 3>atrocities and you know,</v>

1014
00:29:15.351 --> 00:29:16.820
<v Speaker 3>sometimes you need to do it to stop it,</v>

1015
00:29:16.821 --> 00:29:17.654
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

1016
00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:20.660
<v Speaker 3>which is the view that I have.</v>

1017
00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:21.733
<v Speaker 3>I think that,</v>

1018
00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:22.250
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1019
00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:23.083
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>

1020
00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:28.240
<v Speaker 3>the more surgical your methodology is and it seems like drone strikes tend to be</v>

1021
00:29:29.570 --> 00:29:30.111
<v Speaker 3>better,</v>

1022
00:29:30.111 --> 00:29:31.700
<v Speaker 3>a better option than the other ones.</v>

1023
00:29:31.701 --> 00:29:31.940
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1024
00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:34.700
<v Speaker 3>there's elements of it that I know about the debate,</v>

1025
00:29:34.701 --> 00:29:36.560
<v Speaker 3>like the fact that you're sitting far away,</v>

1026
00:29:36.850 --> 00:29:40.430
<v Speaker 3>it's very sort of inhuman don't contact.</v>

1027
00:29:40.431 --> 00:29:41.650
<v Speaker 3>You're very detached because,</v>

1028
00:29:41.651 --> 00:29:41.801
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1029
00:29:41.801 --> 00:29:42.300
<v Speaker 3>you just,</v>

1030
00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:43.470
<v Speaker 3>it's like a remote control on.</v>

1031
00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:45.250
<v Speaker 3>They're firing off a missile.</v>

1032
00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:47.530
<v Speaker 3>Like that part of it sucks.</v>

1033
00:29:47.910 --> 00:29:48.160
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1034
00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:50.440
<v Speaker 3>but there's a lot of things about it that suck,</v>

1035
00:29:50.441 --> 00:29:52.240
<v Speaker 3>but I just don't know,</v>

1036
00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:53.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1037
00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:58.260
<v Speaker 3>how else I don't know what other options there are to handle the situation and</v>

1038
00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:01.540
<v Speaker 3>it is affecting them.</v>

1039
00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:01.841
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1040
00:30:01.841 --> 00:30:04.930
<v Speaker 3>it's not like the Taliban seemed to be more upset about the drone strikes and</v>

1041
00:30:04.931 --> 00:30:05.764
<v Speaker 3>anybody else,</v>

1042
00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:06.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1043
00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:08.730
<v Speaker 3>that means that it is kind of hitting them and they,</v>

1044
00:30:08.731 --> 00:30:13.090
<v Speaker 3>they do know that the world has a lot of sympathy for civilian casualties.</v>

1045
00:30:13.091 --> 00:30:15.010
<v Speaker 3>They know that at that itself.</v>

1046
00:30:15.011 --> 00:30:17.230
<v Speaker 3>Just the fact that you know,</v>

1047
00:30:17.290 --> 00:30:17.800
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1048
00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:22.800
<v Speaker 3>they know that they can use these civilian casualties to their benefit that</v>

1049
00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:25.210
<v Speaker 3>automatically shows you that there is a,</v>

1050
00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:27.760
<v Speaker 3>there's an ethical difference between both sides.</v>

1051
00:30:28.790 --> 00:30:29.623
<v Speaker 3>So it's not.</v>

1052
00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:30.901
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1053
00:30:30.901 --> 00:30:34.200
<v Speaker 4>you're saying that meaning that they do it on purpose,</v>

1054
00:30:34.201 --> 00:30:39.201
<v Speaker 4>that they have areas set up in high civilian population areas knowing that</v>

1055
00:30:39.211 --> 00:30:43.350
<v Speaker 4>they'll get hit in those areas and it will cause civilian deaths so that those</v>

1056
00:30:43.351 --> 00:30:45.800
<v Speaker 4>civilian deaths will be used to sort of promote their columns.</v>

1057
00:30:45.801 --> 00:30:46.190
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1058
00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:46.441
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1059
00:30:46.441 --> 00:30:46.590
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

1060
00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:47.720
<v Speaker 3>I mean they absolutely do that.</v>

1061
00:30:47.721 --> 00:30:47.931
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1062
00:30:47.931 --> 00:30:48.741
<v Speaker 3>think about it again,</v>

1063
00:30:48.741 --> 00:30:52.010
<v Speaker 3>you were talking about getting in the mind of a conspiracy theorist and think</v>

1064
00:30:52.011 --> 00:30:57.011
<v Speaker 3>about if you were one of those people and you knew that a lot of people don't</v>

1065
00:30:57.441 --> 00:30:58.100
<v Speaker 3>agree with you.</v>

1066
00:30:58.100 --> 00:30:58.821
<v Speaker 3>Everybody thinks that,</v>

1067
00:30:58.821 --> 00:30:59.001
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1068
00:30:59.001 --> 00:31:00.680
<v Speaker 3>you're back in the stone ages and so on,</v>

1069
00:31:00.681 --> 00:31:03.890
<v Speaker 3>but the one time you get a lot of sympathy is when there are a lot of innocence</v>

1070
00:31:03.891 --> 00:31:04.281
<v Speaker 3>killed.</v>

1071
00:31:04.281 --> 00:31:05.270
<v Speaker 3>And then you know,</v>

1072
00:31:05.271 --> 00:31:05.601
<v Speaker 3>everyone,</v>

1073
00:31:05.601 --> 00:31:07.950
<v Speaker 3>all of these powerful political figures and journalists,</v>

1074
00:31:07.951 --> 00:31:10.670
<v Speaker 3>everything around the world suddenly start,</v>

1075
00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:11.560
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1076
00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:12.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1077
00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:14.090
<v Speaker 3>sort of coming to your site against your enemy.</v>

1078
00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:17.720
<v Speaker 3>Then why wouldn't you exploit that when you have nothing.</v>

1079
00:31:17.721 --> 00:31:19.040
<v Speaker 3>You have like shitty weapons,</v>

1080
00:31:19.041 --> 00:31:19.191
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1081
00:31:19.191 --> 00:31:20.450
<v Speaker 3>you're living in the middle of nowhere.</v>

1082
00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:22.430
<v Speaker 3>And if that's the only power you have,</v>

1083
00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:24.800
<v Speaker 3>that's one of your strongest weapons,</v>

1084
00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:25.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1085
00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.480
<v Speaker 3>you'd exploited everybody would,</v>

1086
00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:29.710
<v Speaker 4>I can certainly see that.</v>

1087
00:31:29.711 --> 00:31:32.890
<v Speaker 4>But I can also certainly see the argument that one of the best recruiting</v>

1088
00:31:32.891 --> 00:31:37.891
<v Speaker 4>methods for the Taliban or Al Qaeda is having your family blown up by a drone.</v>

1089
00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:39.430
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1090
00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:41.720
<v Speaker 4>and that has happened to it.</v>

1091
00:31:41.730 --> 00:31:42.341
<v Speaker 4>And it works.</v>

1092
00:31:42.341 --> 00:31:43.121
<v Speaker 4>And that's what I'm saying.</v>

1093
00:31:43.121 --> 00:31:45.340
<v Speaker 4>This is really complicated.</v>

1094
00:31:45.410 --> 00:31:45.850
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1095
00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:46.683
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1096
00:31:46.970 --> 00:31:48.670
<v Speaker 4>are we in a state of perpetual war?</v>

1097
00:31:49.490 --> 00:31:50.323
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1098
00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:52.091
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1099
00:31:52.091 --> 00:31:52.924
<v Speaker 3>That's a,</v>

1100
00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:54.970
<v Speaker 3>I'm not qualified to answer.</v>

1101
00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.520
<v Speaker 4>What's this a weird war in that sense,</v>

1102
00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:03.420
<v Speaker 4>because all the wars throughout history seemed to have been about someone trying</v>

1103
00:32:03.761 --> 00:32:05.290
<v Speaker 4>to take over something,</v>

1104
00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:10.740
<v Speaker 4>whereas this one seems to be at least a big part of the root of it seems to be</v>

1105
00:32:11.381 --> 00:32:12.640
<v Speaker 4>religious ideology.</v>

1106
00:32:13.510 --> 00:32:13.790
<v Speaker 3>It is,</v>

1107
00:32:13.790 --> 00:32:13.910
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1108
00:32:13.910 --> 00:32:15.230
<v Speaker 3>It takes you back to that.</v>

1109
00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:17.060
<v Speaker 3>The Samuel Huntington paper,</v>

1110
00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:18.470
<v Speaker 3>the clash of civilizations.</v>

1111
00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:20.240
<v Speaker 3>What does that paper it's um,</v>

1112
00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:21.610
<v Speaker 3>he predicted it.</v>

1113
00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:23.180
<v Speaker 3>He was this a political scientist,</v>

1114
00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:24.381
<v Speaker 3>I think in the nineties.</v>

1115
00:32:24.381 --> 00:32:27.590
<v Speaker 3>He wrote this paper and later expanded into a book and it's called the clash of</v>

1116
00:32:27.591 --> 00:32:28.191
<v Speaker 3>civilizations.</v>

1117
00:32:28.191 --> 00:32:31.960
<v Speaker 3>It was like a sort of a prophecy about the future and um,</v>

1118
00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:34.130
<v Speaker 3>what kind of conflicts people going to get into.</v>

1119
00:32:34.131 --> 00:32:36.170
<v Speaker 3>And he said that it wouldn't be ideological.</v>

1120
00:32:36.171 --> 00:32:40.760
<v Speaker 3>This is about post Cold War and inside it won't be an ideological,</v>

1121
00:32:40.761 --> 00:32:42.920
<v Speaker 3>it'll be cultural and uh,</v>

1122
00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:45.110
<v Speaker 3>it'll be between like religious groups.</v>

1123
00:32:45.111 --> 00:32:50.111
<v Speaker 3>And he actually talked about the Islamic world and about seven or eight other</v>

1124
00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:54.650
<v Speaker 3>civilizations and how they're going to get into cultural conflict.</v>

1125
00:32:55.030 --> 00:32:55.863
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1126
00:32:56.390 --> 00:32:59.980
<v Speaker 3>and he was conservative and a lot of people criticized that and yeah,</v>

1127
00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:01.430
<v Speaker 3>that time I thought it was kind of,</v>

1128
00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:02.090
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1129
00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:04.070
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't completely completely in line with it,</v>

1130
00:33:04.071 --> 00:33:05.220
<v Speaker 3>but now more,</v>

1131
00:33:05.221 --> 00:33:05.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1132
00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:06.530
<v Speaker 3>as time goes on,</v>

1133
00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:11.390
<v Speaker 3>every once in a while go back to no to revisit the paper and it seems to make</v>

1134
00:33:11.391 --> 00:33:11.901
<v Speaker 3>more sense.</v>

1135
00:33:11.901 --> 00:33:12.351
<v Speaker 3>Almost like,</v>

1136
00:33:12.351 --> 00:33:12.561
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1137
00:33:12.561 --> 00:33:14.540
<v Speaker 3>he kind of knew what he was talking about.</v>

1138
00:33:15.290 --> 00:33:17.460
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever tried to look objectively,</v>

1139
00:33:17.461 --> 00:33:21.480
<v Speaker 4>like if you were the engineer of modern society or modern civilization and he</v>

1140
00:33:21.481 --> 00:33:22.680
<v Speaker 4>tried to look objectively,</v>

1141
00:33:22.681 --> 00:33:27.681
<v Speaker 4>like sit on it in a high chair with a desk above the earth and garden,</v>

1142
00:33:27.751 --> 00:33:29.220
<v Speaker 4>how do I fix this mess?</v>

1143
00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:34.580
<v Speaker 4>How do I stop all these silly monkeys from blowing each other up and shooting</v>

1144
00:33:34.681 --> 00:33:39.681
<v Speaker 4>rockets from robots that fly above their cities and blowing up bombs and their</v>

1145
00:33:39.841 --> 00:33:40.500
<v Speaker 4>buildings?</v>

1146
00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:41.580
<v Speaker 4>How do you stop that?</v>

1147
00:33:42.150 --> 00:33:42.840
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever.</v>

1148
00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:45.390
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever tried to see like is there a way,</v>

1149
00:33:45.391 --> 00:33:47.130
<v Speaker 4>like a longterm short term,</v>

1150
00:33:47.131 --> 00:33:50.340
<v Speaker 4>any term way to sort of engineer this away?</v>

1151
00:33:50.610 --> 00:33:51.780
<v Speaker 3>I think the longterm.</v>

1152
00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:57.740
<v Speaker 3>I think we discount the role of a ideology and belief when it comes to this and</v>

1153
00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:01.410
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how to solve it,</v>

1154
00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:06.030
<v Speaker 3>but I know one way to move closer to solving it and that's just being honest</v>

1155
00:34:06.031 --> 00:34:07.050
<v Speaker 3>about what the problem is.</v>

1156
00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:07.890
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1157
00:34:07.890 --> 00:34:08.910
<v Speaker 3>a lot of the problem,</v>

1158
00:34:08.911 --> 00:34:09.744
<v Speaker 3>like for example,</v>

1159
00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:10.800
<v Speaker 3>the Islamic state,</v>

1160
00:34:11.010 --> 00:34:11.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1161
00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:12.540
<v Speaker 3>they're yelling,</v>

1162
00:34:12.541 --> 00:34:14.670
<v Speaker 3>Allahu akbar into the quoting the Koran and everything.</v>

1163
00:34:14.671 --> 00:34:16.650
<v Speaker 3>I this is it weak,</v>

1164
00:34:16.670 --> 00:34:17.430
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

1165
00:34:17.430 --> 00:34:17.941
<v Speaker 3>cartoons,</v>

1166
00:34:17.941 --> 00:34:20.460
<v Speaker 3>people making cartoons and then getting shot up for it.</v>

1167
00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:21.211
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1168
00:34:21.211 --> 00:34:21.391
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1169
00:34:21.391 --> 00:34:22.500
<v Speaker 3>these are all things that,</v>

1170
00:34:22.950 --> 00:34:23.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1171
00:34:23.330 --> 00:34:23.481
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

1172
00:34:23.481 --> 00:34:26.250
<v Speaker 3>there is an identifiable issue.</v>

1173
00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:29.240
<v Speaker 3>There's a root cause here that everybody seems to deny it.</v>

1174
00:34:29.241 --> 00:34:32.040
<v Speaker 3>Like including all the prime ministers like this has nothing to do with</v>

1175
00:34:32.041 --> 00:34:32.874
<v Speaker 3>religion,</v>

1176
00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:34.050
<v Speaker 3>but just,</v>

1177
00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:34.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1178
00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:36.750
<v Speaker 3>like I grew up in a Libya,</v>

1179
00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:37.770
<v Speaker 3>Saudi Arabia,</v>

1180
00:34:38.010 --> 00:34:38.521
<v Speaker 3>Pakistan.</v>

1181
00:34:38.521 --> 00:34:40.440
<v Speaker 3>I didn't come to North America until I was 24.</v>

1182
00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:44.010
<v Speaker 3>I grew up in pretty much Muslim majority countries and some very conservative</v>

1183
00:34:44.050 --> 00:34:45.240
<v Speaker 3>ones all the time.</v>

1184
00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:46.583
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1185
00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:47.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1186
00:34:47.010 --> 00:34:47.850
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

1187
00:34:47.851 --> 00:34:51.030
<v Speaker 3>whenever I hear people say that this has nothing to do with religion,</v>

1188
00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:53.250
<v Speaker 3>it just doesn't make any sense to me.</v>

1189
00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:57.810
<v Speaker 4>Is that like an American liberal convenient thing to say because it makes you</v>

1190
00:34:57.811 --> 00:35:01.020
<v Speaker 4>look super sensitive and very noam Chomsky ask.</v>

1191
00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:01.521
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1192
00:35:01.521 --> 00:35:02.001
<v Speaker 3>it does.</v>

1193
00:35:02.001 --> 00:35:02.470
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

1194
00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:02.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1195
00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:03.630
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

1196
00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:04.463
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

1197
00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:07.490
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what goes into it.</v>

1198
00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:10.280
<v Speaker 3>I know that there's a lot of fear and going to people don't want to criticize</v>

1199
00:35:10.281 --> 00:35:10.461
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

1200
00:35:10.461 --> 00:35:11.000
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1201
00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:11.241
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1202
00:35:11.241 --> 00:35:12.720
<v Speaker 3>we saw what happened with someone rusty,</v>

1203
00:35:12.750 --> 00:35:13.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1204
00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:14.990
<v Speaker 3>all the way up to the Paris attacks.</v>

1205
00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:19.010
<v Speaker 3>So there is a fear of that and there's also a fear of being seen as a bigot.</v>

1206
00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:20.433
<v Speaker 3>That was,</v>

1207
00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:22.400
<v Speaker 3>I call it Islamophobia Phobia.</v>

1208
00:35:23.350 --> 00:35:26.770
<v Speaker 4>People like the word and you know,</v>

1209
00:35:26.790 --> 00:35:27.780
<v Speaker 4>I'm a phobia phobia.</v>

1210
00:35:27.781 --> 00:35:28.614
<v Speaker 4>I love it.</v>

1211
00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:31.860
<v Speaker 4>It's something that a lot of people relate to immediately.</v>

1212
00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:32.331
<v Speaker 4>Turn it,</v>

1213
00:35:32.331 --> 00:35:33.164
<v Speaker 4>here it is.</v>

1214
00:35:33.450 --> 00:35:34.470
<v Speaker 4>I hate that term.</v>

1215
00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:35.410
<v Speaker 4>Islamophobia.</v>

1216
00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:36.253
<v Speaker 4>And look,</v>

1217
00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:37.650
<v Speaker 4>what about Christian have phobia.</v>

1218
00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:38.130
<v Speaker 4>What's</v>

1219
00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:41.640
<v Speaker 1>hilarious to me is that a lot of quote unquote progressive,</v>

1220
00:35:41.641 --> 00:35:46.641
<v Speaker 1>very left wing people will openly mock Christianity while defending Islam or by</v>

1221
00:35:48.090 --> 00:35:51.090
<v Speaker 1>labeling people Islamophobic who are conservative.</v>

1222
00:35:51.130 --> 00:35:51.401
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1223
00:35:51.401 --> 00:35:51.511
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1224
00:35:51.511 --> 00:35:53.380
<v Speaker 3>I mean you gotta you gotta stay consistent.</v>

1225
00:35:53.381 --> 00:35:54.670
<v Speaker 3>If you're a true liberal,</v>

1226
00:35:54.671 --> 00:35:56.410
<v Speaker 3>and I know everybody's saying this,</v>

1227
00:35:56.470 --> 00:35:58.280
<v Speaker 3>well unfortunately not everybody's saying it,</v>

1228
00:35:58.300 --> 00:35:59.500
<v Speaker 3>I wish more people were saying it,</v>

1229
00:35:59.501 --> 00:36:00.200
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

1230
00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:01.033
<v Speaker 3>if you are,</v>

1231
00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:03.580
<v Speaker 3>for instance opposed to killing gay people,</v>

1232
00:36:04.090 --> 00:36:05.920
<v Speaker 3>you should be opposed to killing gay people,</v>

1233
00:36:05.921 --> 00:36:10.921
<v Speaker 3>whether it's in the KKK manifesto or the Bible or the Koran or in the Republican</v>

1234
00:36:12.610 --> 00:36:12.650
<v Speaker 3>Party,</v>

1235
00:36:12.650 --> 00:36:13.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1236
00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:13.900
<v Speaker 3>or in Uganda,</v>

1237
00:36:13.930 --> 00:36:16.090
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't matter what it is,</v>

1238
00:36:16.091 --> 00:36:18.670
<v Speaker 3>if you're opposed to something you should be opposed to it across the board.</v>

1239
00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:21.520
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't suddenly become respectful that,</v>

1240
00:36:21.521 --> 00:36:21.761
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1241
00:36:21.761 --> 00:36:22.120
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>

1242
00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:22.841
<v Speaker 3>well it's in the Bible.</v>

1243
00:36:22.841 --> 00:36:23.770
<v Speaker 3>So we got to respect that.</v>

1244
00:36:24.490 --> 00:36:29.050
<v Speaker 3>And respect for ideas is just such an overrated.</v>

1245
00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:34.600
<v Speaker 3>It's considered a virtue in respecting people's ideas and beliefs and ideas are</v>

1246
00:36:34.601 --> 00:36:35.434
<v Speaker 3>not people.</v>

1247
00:36:35.490 --> 00:36:35.710
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1248
00:36:35.710 --> 00:36:37.060
<v Speaker 3>that kids and I was trying to,</v>

1249
00:36:37.130 --> 00:36:39.070
<v Speaker 3>that's the problem with the word Islamophobia,</v>

1250
00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:44.520
<v Speaker 3>is that it implies criticism of an idea and there is genuine anti Muslim</v>

1251
00:36:44.981 --> 00:36:45.580
<v Speaker 3>bigotry.</v>

1252
00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:47.890
<v Speaker 3>People do commit hate crimes against Muslims,</v>

1253
00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:49.293
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>

1254
00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:50.710
<v Speaker 3>Muslims are people.</v>

1255
00:36:50.711 --> 00:36:52.030
<v Speaker 3>They are not,</v>

1256
00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:53.650
<v Speaker 3>I mean they're entitled to respect.</v>

1257
00:36:53.651 --> 00:36:54.484
<v Speaker 3>They have rights.</v>

1258
00:36:54.490 --> 00:36:56.110
<v Speaker 3>Islam itself is not a person,</v>

1259
00:36:56.111 --> 00:36:56.770
<v Speaker 3>it's just a,</v>

1260
00:36:56.770 --> 00:36:57.551
<v Speaker 3>it's a book,</v>

1261
00:36:57.551 --> 00:36:58.540
<v Speaker 3>it's an ideology,</v>

1262
00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:01.960
<v Speaker 3>it's an ideology is a bunch of ideas in a book so it doesn't have rights and</v>

1263
00:37:01.961 --> 00:37:03.190
<v Speaker 3>it's not entitled to respect.</v>

1264
00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:04.031
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1265
00:37:04.031 --> 00:37:04.630
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1266
00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:08.830
<v Speaker 1>so the idea of Islamophobia is a phobia of ideas that are irrational and</v>

1267
00:37:08.831 --> 00:37:09.510
<v Speaker 1>ancient.</v>

1268
00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:09.761
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1269
00:37:09.761 --> 00:37:11.170
<v Speaker 1>That seems to be pretty smart,</v>

1270
00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:14.050
<v Speaker 1>but it's connected somehow or another to racism.</v>

1271
00:37:14.051 --> 00:37:16.990
<v Speaker 1>And this is where it gets weird because progressive people don't want to</v>

1272
00:37:16.991 --> 00:37:18.970
<v Speaker 1>criticize anybody with extra melanin.</v>

1273
00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:19.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1274
00:37:19.450 --> 00:37:23.470
<v Speaker 1>Anybody that's remotely browner than them gets immediate free pass.</v>

1275
00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:24.340
<v Speaker 1>But see,</v>

1276
00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:25.840
<v Speaker 1>like the Boston bombers.</v>

1277
00:37:25.841 --> 00:37:26.120
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1278
00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:28.210
<v Speaker 1>And there were from Dagestan?</v>

1279
00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:28.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1280
00:37:28.690 --> 00:37:30.370
<v Speaker 1>They're from where they're from.</v>

1281
00:37:30.430 --> 00:37:31.263
<v Speaker 1>Caucasian.</v>

1282
00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:32.200
<v Speaker 1>Is that how you pronounce it?</v>

1283
00:37:32.201 --> 00:37:32.560
<v Speaker 1>Cocky,</v>

1284
00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:34.030
<v Speaker 1>but he doesn't do this or he's wrong.</v>

1285
00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:35.950
<v Speaker 1>He knows what beyonce is.</v>

1286
00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:39.280
<v Speaker 1>Wait is her ring sizes and shoe size.</v>

1287
00:37:39.281 --> 00:37:40.390
<v Speaker 1>He knows when she was born.</v>

1288
00:37:40.391 --> 00:37:42.040
<v Speaker 1>He knows who choose to date.</v>

1289
00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:43.180
<v Speaker 1>We need to talk later.</v>

1290
00:37:43.570 --> 00:37:44.403
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>

1291
00:37:46.890 --> 00:37:47.723
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>

1292
00:37:47.950 --> 00:37:52.950
<v Speaker 3>Boston bombers are actually from a place where the word Caucasian comes from the</v>

1293
00:37:53.771 --> 00:37:55.150
<v Speaker 3>caucus mountains.</v>

1294
00:37:55.630 --> 00:37:56.463
<v Speaker 3>So there from there.</v>

1295
00:37:56.770 --> 00:37:57.520
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

1296
00:37:57.520 --> 00:38:01.360
<v Speaker 3>they were white that the underwear bomber was black.</v>

1297
00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:04.720
<v Speaker 3>The Jose Padilla was a Hispanic,</v>

1298
00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:05.710
<v Speaker 3>you know this,</v>

1299
00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:06.850
<v Speaker 3>so it's not a race.</v>

1300
00:38:06.851 --> 00:38:07.990
<v Speaker 3>All of these people were Muslim.</v>

1301
00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:10.240
<v Speaker 3>And the thing is,</v>

1302
00:38:10.241 --> 00:38:10.561
<v Speaker 3>if you're,</v>

1303
00:38:10.561 --> 00:38:13.600
<v Speaker 3>if you're saying that criticizing Islam is somehow racist,</v>

1304
00:38:13.930 --> 00:38:16.360
<v Speaker 3>you're assuming that all of Islam is a race.</v>

1305
00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:19.690
<v Speaker 3>What does that make you write that itself?</v>

1306
00:38:19.691 --> 00:38:19.870
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1307
00:38:19.870 --> 00:38:20.090
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

1308
00:38:20.090 --> 00:38:20.680
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

1309
00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:21.970
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly what racism is.</v>

1310
00:38:21.971 --> 00:38:24.340
<v Speaker 3>When you assume that everything that entire religion is one race.</v>

1311
00:38:24.410 --> 00:38:24.680
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1312
00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:25.790
<v Speaker 1>We're completely ignorant.</v>

1313
00:38:25.850 --> 00:38:26.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1314
00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:27.980
<v Speaker 1>So there's some white,</v>

1315
00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:29.600
<v Speaker 1>blue eyed Muslims,</v>

1316
00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:30.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1317
00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:30.701
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>

1318
00:38:30.701 --> 00:38:31.230
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of,</v>

1319
00:38:31.230 --> 00:38:32.300
<v Speaker 1>if you look at Mecca,</v>

1320
00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:33.680
<v Speaker 1>you see like the people that are in Mecca,</v>

1321
00:38:33.681 --> 00:38:35.000
<v Speaker 1>you'll see redheaded people,</v>

1322
00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:40.030
<v Speaker 1>red haired people that are walking around with the traditional garb on,</v>

1323
00:38:40.031 --> 00:38:40.864
<v Speaker 1>circling back.</v>

1324
00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:41.481
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1325
00:38:41.481 --> 00:38:43.400
<v Speaker 3>And then there's a Turkey.</v>

1326
00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:45.350
<v Speaker 3>So Turkey is a big Muslim country.</v>

1327
00:38:45.351 --> 00:38:45.711
<v Speaker 3>Egypt,</v>

1328
00:38:45.711 --> 00:38:46.610
<v Speaker 3>a big Muslim country.</v>

1329
00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:49.430
<v Speaker 3>Indonesia is Iran where everybody's Persian.</v>

1330
00:38:49.690 --> 00:38:51.170
<v Speaker 3>That there's the Arab world in the south.</v>

1331
00:38:51.171 --> 00:38:51.681
<v Speaker 3>Asians.</v>

1332
00:38:51.681 --> 00:38:54.800
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's just racially incredibly diverse.</v>

1333
00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:55.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1334
00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:55.830
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1335
00:38:55.830 --> 00:38:56.663
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1336
00:38:56.810 --> 00:38:57.110
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1337
00:38:57.110 --> 00:38:57.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1338
00:38:57.390 --> 00:38:58.660
<v Speaker 3>it's not really a race.</v>

1339
00:38:58.670 --> 00:38:59.503
<v Speaker 3>And I was,</v>

1340
00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:00.890
<v Speaker 3>I think I saw something with,</v>

1341
00:39:00.891 --> 00:39:04.820
<v Speaker 3>is this woman wearing a niqab and someone wrote a funny comment about it in the</v>

1342
00:39:04.830 --> 00:39:05.040
<v Speaker 3>cup,</v>

1343
00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:06.380
<v Speaker 3>the face veil and the,</v>

1344
00:39:06.381 --> 00:39:06.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1345
00:39:06.650 --> 00:39:08.690
<v Speaker 3>full cover the Brca.</v>

1346
00:39:09.170 --> 00:39:10.003
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1347
00:39:10.590 --> 00:39:11.091
<v Speaker 3>someone was like,</v>

1348
00:39:11.091 --> 00:39:11.241
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1349
00:39:11.241 --> 00:39:13.850
<v Speaker 3>that's what you're doing is racist or making fun of this.</v>

1350
00:39:13.851 --> 00:39:14.290
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

1351
00:39:14.290 --> 00:39:14.571
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

1352
00:39:14.571 --> 00:39:16.070
<v Speaker 3>can you tell me what fucking Reishi is?</v>

1353
00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:16.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1354
00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:17.383
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>

1355
00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:18.420
<v Speaker 1>how is that racist?</v>

1356
00:39:18.421 --> 00:39:19.470
<v Speaker 1>That's mind blowing.</v>

1357
00:39:19.530 --> 00:39:21.240
<v Speaker 1>You don't even know if it's a man or a woman.</v>

1358
00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:25.350
<v Speaker 1>This can't see these are knee jerk liberal ideas that are promoted in</v>

1359
00:39:25.351 --> 00:39:26.140
<v Speaker 1>universities,</v>

1360
00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:27.780
<v Speaker 1>the hyper sensitive,</v>

1361
00:39:27.781 --> 00:39:32.460
<v Speaker 1>hyper progressive atmosphere that it literally eliminates objective thinking and</v>

1362
00:39:32.461 --> 00:39:33.060
<v Speaker 1>reasoning.</v>

1363
00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:33.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1364
00:39:33.290 --> 00:39:33.860
<v Speaker 1>Because you,</v>

1365
00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:38.310
<v Speaker 1>you are already automatically expected to behave in a certain way of thinking a</v>

1366
00:39:38.311 --> 00:39:41.130
<v Speaker 1>certain way because that is the progressive manifesto.</v>

1367
00:39:41.131 --> 00:39:41.491
<v Speaker 1>Like your,</v>

1368
00:39:41.491 --> 00:39:45.120
<v Speaker 1>your ideas like you're not supposed to criticize Islamic people.</v>

1369
00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:46.950
<v Speaker 1>It is Islamophobia.</v>

1370
00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:51.580
<v Speaker 1>The idea that we supposed to be in their land and that is this Islamophobia and</v>

1371
00:39:51.581 --> 00:39:55.570
<v Speaker 1>that word is just so fucking thrown about over the last decade or so.</v>

1372
00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:56.503
<v Speaker 1>It's toxic.</v>

1373
00:39:56.990 --> 00:40:00.750
<v Speaker 3>And I was trying to give the example of myself is that if I went back to Saudi</v>

1374
00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:02.520
<v Speaker 3>Arabia or any of the countries where I grew up,</v>

1375
00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:04.830
<v Speaker 3>and if they do the stuff that I write,</v>

1376
00:40:04.890 --> 00:40:05.590
<v Speaker 3>then,</v>

1377
00:40:05.590 --> 00:40:06.300
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1378
00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:09.660
<v Speaker 3>I have reason to be Islamophobic because by their Islamic laws,</v>

1379
00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:10.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1380
00:40:10.050 --> 00:40:10.470
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1381
00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:13.440
<v Speaker 3>it's just not something I like thinking about what could happen to me.</v>

1382
00:40:14.310 --> 00:40:14.461
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1383
00:40:14.461 --> 00:40:15.510
<v Speaker 1>you're an apostate,</v>

1384
00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:16.630
<v Speaker 1>an apostate.</v>

1385
00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:18.060
<v Speaker 1>You should be beheaded,</v>

1386
00:40:18.270 --> 00:40:18.601
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1387
00:40:18.601 --> 00:40:19.351
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that the idea?</v>

1388
00:40:19.351 --> 00:40:22.020
<v Speaker 1>Technically I should be the fuck man.</v>

1389
00:40:22.170 --> 00:40:24.480
<v Speaker 1>You should be phobic of those ideas.</v>

1390
00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:25.040
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

1391
00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:25.950
<v Speaker 1>It's a legitimate</v>

1392
00:40:27.810 --> 00:40:28.650
<v Speaker 1>fear and it's,</v>

1393
00:40:28.651 --> 00:40:30.600
<v Speaker 1>it's not irrational by any means.</v>

1394
00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:31.890
<v Speaker 1>Phobia means a fear,</v>

1395
00:40:31.891 --> 00:40:32.280
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1396
00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:32.640
<v Speaker 1>Does it,</v>

1397
00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:33.530
<v Speaker 1>does it mean irrational?</v>

1398
00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:35.000
<v Speaker 1>Just international?</v>

1399
00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:37.410
<v Speaker 1>I think the medical definition is an irrational fear,</v>

1400
00:40:37.590 --> 00:40:38.510
<v Speaker 1>like irrational fear.</v>

1401
00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:41.430
<v Speaker 1>I think any fear of being beheaded,</v>

1402
00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:44.070
<v Speaker 1>you mean not yet super rational.</v>

1403
00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:44.910
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1404
00:40:44.910 --> 00:40:47.160
<v Speaker 1>So that's why that makes it even more of a misnomer.</v>

1405
00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:48.510
<v Speaker 1>If somebody writes down,</v>

1406
00:40:48.511 --> 00:40:51.600
<v Speaker 1>I want to cut your fucking head off and you don't,</v>

1407
00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:53.790
<v Speaker 1>you're a phobic of that person.</v>

1408
00:40:53.791 --> 00:40:54.350
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

1409
00:40:54.350 --> 00:40:55.080
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1410
00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:58.530
<v Speaker 1>of course I went to cut my head off because of a belief.</v>

1411
00:40:59.370 --> 00:41:00.203
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

1412
00:41:00.310 --> 00:41:03.690
<v Speaker 1>there's that aspect and then there's also the anti Muslim bigotry which is a</v>

1413
00:41:03.691 --> 00:41:05.160
<v Speaker 1>separate thing which is real.</v>

1414
00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:05.381
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1415
00:41:05.381 --> 00:41:07.170
<v Speaker 1>And it's based on people's targeting people.</v>

1416
00:41:07.171 --> 00:41:07.871
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1417
00:41:07.871 --> 00:41:08.120
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1418
00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:10.380
<v Speaker 1>I have been on the receiving end of that as well.</v>

1419
00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:11.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean that has happened.</v>

1420
00:41:11.431 --> 00:41:15.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean people have told me after the Charlie Hebdo toxic and people said,</v>

1421
00:41:15.031 --> 00:41:15.181
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1422
00:41:15.181 --> 00:41:17.510
<v Speaker 1>you guys scummy should get outta here wherever you heard this.</v>

1423
00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:20.110
<v Speaker 1>This is like on twitter or facebook messages.</v>

1424
00:41:20.111 --> 00:41:21.000
<v Speaker 1>Like I'll get emails,</v>

1425
00:41:21.001 --> 00:41:22.470
<v Speaker 1>real people or eggs.</v>

1426
00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:24.480
<v Speaker 1>It sounded pretty real.</v>

1427
00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:25.171
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1428
00:41:25.171 --> 00:41:28.410
<v Speaker 1>Like was it like a person where you knew you could track their account?</v>

1429
00:41:28.411 --> 00:41:29.244
<v Speaker 1>You could read their.</v>

1430
00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:29.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1431
00:41:29.690 --> 00:41:30.430
<v Speaker 1>I knew them.</v>

1432
00:41:30.430 --> 00:41:32.090
<v Speaker 1>Like I know I know who these people are.</v>

1433
00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:32.221
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1434
00:41:32.221 --> 00:41:33.054
<v Speaker 1>you know them.</v>

1435
00:41:33.250 --> 00:41:34.160
<v Speaker 1>Many of them are real</v>

1436
00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:34.610
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

1437
00:41:34.610 --> 00:41:34.851
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1438
00:41:34.851 --> 00:41:35.684
<v Speaker 3>not in person.</v>

1439
00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:36.200
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1440
00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:37.430
<v Speaker 3>not in person over here.</v>

1441
00:41:37.431 --> 00:41:38.990
<v Speaker 3>Fortunately like I haven't really had that.</v>

1442
00:41:38.991 --> 00:41:41.930
<v Speaker 3>The only sort of personal thing I've had is,</v>

1443
00:41:41.980 --> 00:41:42.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1444
00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:43.940
<v Speaker 3>the Tsa at the airport,</v>

1445
00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:44.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1446
00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:45.290
<v Speaker 3>the random checks.</v>

1447
00:41:45.550 --> 00:41:47.930
<v Speaker 3>Like I always get selected for the random check and things like that.</v>

1448
00:41:47.931 --> 00:41:48.764
<v Speaker 3>Look at you.</v>

1449
00:41:49.250 --> 00:41:49.790
<v Speaker 3>There you go.</v>

1450
00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:51.320
<v Speaker 3>So that happens and then,</v>

1451
00:41:51.321 --> 00:41:52.030
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1452
00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:52.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1453
00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:53.660
<v Speaker 3>my passport has,</v>

1454
00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:53.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1455
00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:55.210
<v Speaker 3>by like the,</v>

1456
00:41:55.880 --> 00:42:00.530
<v Speaker 3>my record of living in all these different Middle Eastern countries and the name</v>

1457
00:42:00.531 --> 00:42:01.364
<v Speaker 3>and the skin color,</v>

1458
00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:02.690
<v Speaker 3>so that does</v>

1459
00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:05.330
<v Speaker 3>put me in the same category.</v>

1460
00:42:05.331 --> 00:42:08.270
<v Speaker 3>So I share that experience with a lot of people who do look like me and have the</v>

1461
00:42:08.271 --> 00:42:09.410
<v Speaker 3>same name that I do.</v>

1462
00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:15.040
<v Speaker 3>But the problem with the word Islam phobia is that I think it's an injustice and</v>

1463
00:42:15.741 --> 00:42:20.390
<v Speaker 3>it's actually an insult to the struggles of Muslims who have genuinely been</v>

1464
00:42:20.391 --> 00:42:25.391
<v Speaker 3>victim of anti Muslim bigotry to use their pain and their experience and</v>

1465
00:42:26.631 --> 00:42:29.660
<v Speaker 3>exploited to stifle criticism of Islam.</v>

1466
00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:31.090
<v Speaker 4>Hm.</v>

1467
00:42:31.090 --> 00:42:31.391
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1468
00:42:31.391 --> 00:42:31.941
<v Speaker 4>that's I,</v>

1469
00:42:31.941 --> 00:42:33.580
<v Speaker 4>I would say that that makes sense.</v>

1470
00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:33.970
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1471
00:42:33.970 --> 00:42:38.970
<v Speaker 4>sort of the same way anyone who disagrees with feminist ideology is</v>

1472
00:42:39.191 --> 00:42:42.130
<v Speaker 4>automatically some sort of a,</v>

1473
00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:47.140
<v Speaker 4>a woman hater misogynists to someone who's just a big hit in some way against</v>

1474
00:42:48.131 --> 00:42:49.180
<v Speaker 4>the female gender.</v>

1475
00:42:49.870 --> 00:42:50.830
<v Speaker 4>That's just how it is,</v>

1476
00:42:50.831 --> 00:42:51.161
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1477
00:42:51.161 --> 00:42:56.161
<v Speaker 4>People love to silence ideas with a real simple categorization of you.</v>

1478
00:42:57.910 --> 00:42:58.221
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1479
00:42:58.221 --> 00:42:59.770
<v Speaker 4>you are a racist,</v>

1480
00:42:59.771 --> 00:43:01.600
<v Speaker 4>you are a warmonger.</v>

1481
00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:02.740
<v Speaker 4>You are a,</v>

1482
00:43:03.030 --> 00:43:03.330
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1483
00:43:03.330 --> 00:43:06.640
<v Speaker 4>I saw someone who wrote that about Christopher Hitchens,</v>

1484
00:43:06.641 --> 00:43:10.090
<v Speaker 4>that he was a sexist and a warmonger and I'm like,</v>

1485
00:43:10.180 --> 00:43:10.780
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

1486
00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:13.270
<v Speaker 4>Did you read any of what he wrote?</v>

1487
00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:15.040
<v Speaker 4>Did you listen to any of what he said?</v>

1488
00:43:15.070 --> 00:43:15.903
<v Speaker 4>Like that's,</v>

1489
00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:17.480
<v Speaker 4>that's kind of hilarious.</v>

1490
00:43:17.481 --> 00:43:20.200
<v Speaker 4>Like categorize someone and dismissed them so openly.</v>

1491
00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:20.701
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1492
00:43:20.701 --> 00:43:23.460
<v Speaker 3>with the labels and I think a lot of times you know,</v>

1493
00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:25.650
<v Speaker 3>you don't even have definitions for these terms.</v>

1494
00:43:26.090 --> 00:43:27.130
<v Speaker 3>When you say Islamophobias,</v>

1495
00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:31.710
<v Speaker 3>if you ask someone in a Muslim liberal Muslim in Boston,</v>

1496
00:43:32.050 --> 00:43:33.540
<v Speaker 3>you know what Islam is,</v>

1497
00:43:33.541 --> 00:43:37.890
<v Speaker 3>they'll give you a very different definition than someone who's an isis or the</v>

1498
00:43:37.891 --> 00:43:41.460
<v Speaker 3>Taliban and we don't claim to be Muslim so they have different definitions of</v>

1499
00:43:41.461 --> 00:43:41.581
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1500
00:43:41.581 --> 00:43:43.200
<v Speaker 3>I think feminism is the same way.</v>

1501
00:43:43.450 --> 00:43:46.230
<v Speaker 3>You can talk to 10 different feminists in 10 different definitions.</v>

1502
00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:50.280
<v Speaker 4>This is a real problem with groups in that sense.</v>

1503
00:43:50.281 --> 00:43:51.870
<v Speaker 4>Ideological groups in that sense,</v>

1504
00:43:51.871 --> 00:43:54.390
<v Speaker 4>whether it's men's rights advocates are.</v>

1505
00:43:54.410 --> 00:43:57.690
<v Speaker 4>I mean men's rights advocates are some of the most fucking hilarious people</v>

1506
00:43:57.691 --> 00:44:02.691
<v Speaker 4>online to read their websites and their discussion groups and just a bunch of</v>

1507
00:44:03.181 --> 00:44:04.014
<v Speaker 4>angry.</v>

1508
00:44:04.060 --> 00:44:04.310
<v Speaker 3>Weird.</v>

1509
00:44:04.310 --> 00:44:05.320
<v Speaker 3>That's a recent discovery.</v>

1510
00:44:05.321 --> 00:44:08.740
<v Speaker 3>I actually didn't know about these guys until like a couple of years ago.</v>

1511
00:44:08.810 --> 00:44:11.480
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know about them until I was accused of being one.</v>

1512
00:44:12.050 --> 00:44:13.930
<v Speaker 4>Somebody called me an Mra and I.</v>

1513
00:44:14.010 --> 00:44:15.170
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck is that?</v>

1514
00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:20.450
<v Speaker 4>Some some angry woman was barking at me on twitter calling me an MRA for.</v>

1515
00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:21.590
<v Speaker 4>I forget what it was about.</v>

1516
00:44:22.010 --> 00:44:23.690
<v Speaker 4>So I went and looked at it and I was like,</v>

1517
00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:25.850
<v Speaker 4>Oh fucking Christ.</v>

1518
00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:28.410
<v Speaker 4>I've found the community this.</v>

1519
00:44:28.430 --> 00:44:32.280
<v Speaker 4>I tapped into this vein of men to fucking get over</v>

1520
00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:32.860
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1521
00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:33.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1522
00:44:33.020 --> 00:44:33.421
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

1523
00:44:33.421 --> 00:44:34.530
<v Speaker 3>I just.</v>

1524
00:44:34.531 --> 00:44:38.190
<v Speaker 3>And it's what really sucks sometimes is that you know,</v>

1525
00:44:38.191 --> 00:44:38.370
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

1526
00:44:38.370 --> 00:44:43.370
<v Speaker 3>when you have a certain agenda associated with just a really radical,</v>

1527
00:44:43.711 --> 00:44:44.544
<v Speaker 3>insane group,</v>

1528
00:44:44.970 --> 00:44:48.000
<v Speaker 3>then even if they have legitimate viewpoints about something,</v>

1529
00:44:48.001 --> 00:44:51.360
<v Speaker 3>if they have like supposedly they have like one or two points that are</v>

1530
00:44:51.361 --> 00:44:52.194
<v Speaker 3>legitimate,</v>

1531
00:44:52.230 --> 00:44:53.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1532
00:44:53.010 --> 00:44:55.620
<v Speaker 3>I guess if you're talking about the men's rights,</v>

1533
00:44:55.650 --> 00:44:56.430
<v Speaker 3>custody,</v>

1534
00:44:56.430 --> 00:44:57.930
<v Speaker 3>child custody and things like that one,</v>

1535
00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.680
<v Speaker 3>those are the two that would make sense to you.</v>

1536
00:44:59.750 --> 00:45:00.840
<v Speaker 3>So that's where it ends.</v>

1537
00:45:00.841 --> 00:45:01.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1538
00:45:01.130 --> 00:45:03.270
<v Speaker 3>That's like a rational conversation you can have.</v>

1539
00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:06.480
<v Speaker 3>The problem is anytime you start talking about those issues,</v>

1540
00:45:07.110 --> 00:45:09.270
<v Speaker 3>you'll automatically get labeled as part of that.</v>

1541
00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:10.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1542
00:45:10.150 --> 00:45:14.550
<v Speaker 3>so there's this sort of smearing all painting you with the same brush as</v>

1543
00:45:14.551 --> 00:45:15.170
<v Speaker 3>everybody else,</v>

1544
00:45:15.170 --> 00:45:19.290
<v Speaker 3>but one of the most hilarious things that I read was that a men's rights</v>

1545
00:45:19.470 --> 00:45:24.470
<v Speaker 3>advocates are unnecessary because feminism addresses equality and once women are</v>

1546
00:45:25.021 --> 00:45:26.760
<v Speaker 3>treated as completely equal,</v>

1547
00:45:26.761 --> 00:45:30.130
<v Speaker 3>then and only then should we address men's rights and I'm like,</v>

1548
00:45:30.270 --> 00:45:32.130
<v Speaker 3>that's hilarious.</v>

1549
00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:37.110
<v Speaker 3>Like that is just some weird angry girl who no one wants to touch and she just</v>

1550
00:45:37.111 --> 00:45:40.650
<v Speaker 3>has a lot of bitterness and this is what they're spouting out.</v>

1551
00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:41.551
<v Speaker 3>I've always.</v>

1552
00:45:41.551 --> 00:45:42.120
<v Speaker 3>Actually,</v>

1553
00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:47.120
<v Speaker 3>I was talking to a friend about this yesterday that I think when when you have</v>

1554
00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:50.090
<v Speaker 3>movements and you have like organized movements,</v>

1555
00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:51.690
<v Speaker 3>it's something that you want to achieve.</v>

1556
00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:55.800
<v Speaker 3>Being in opposition to something just makes a lot more sense and it's more</v>

1557
00:45:55.801 --> 00:45:59.850
<v Speaker 3>unifying than standing for something and explained that it was like,</v>

1558
00:45:59.870 --> 00:46:00.030
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1559
00:46:00.030 --> 00:46:00.181
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1560
00:46:00.181 --> 00:46:01.014
<v Speaker 3>if you have,</v>

1561
00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:05.190
<v Speaker 3>if you have a say the feminist movement,</v>

1562
00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:05.461
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1563
00:46:05.461 --> 00:46:05.850
<v Speaker 3>When,</v>

1564
00:46:05.850 --> 00:46:06.683
<v Speaker 3>when you had,</v>

1565
00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:09.180
<v Speaker 3>when feminism meant equality,</v>

1566
00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:09.391
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1567
00:46:09.391 --> 00:46:09.821
<v Speaker 3>economic,</v>

1568
00:46:09.821 --> 00:46:10.081
<v Speaker 3>social,</v>

1569
00:46:10.081 --> 00:46:11.670
<v Speaker 3>political equality for men and women.</v>

1570
00:46:12.110 --> 00:46:12.540
<v Speaker 3>Then you know,</v>

1571
00:46:12.540 --> 00:46:13.380
<v Speaker 3>we're all feminists,</v>

1572
00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:13.741
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1573
00:46:13.741 --> 00:46:13.950
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

1574
00:46:13.950 --> 00:46:14.641
<v Speaker 3>we all had that.</v>

1575
00:46:14.641 --> 00:46:17.660
<v Speaker 3>We oppose gender inequality where we're humanists.</v>

1576
00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:19.410
<v Speaker 3>I mean said feminist.</v>

1577
00:46:19.411 --> 00:46:23.520
<v Speaker 3>It's just identifying very specifically with one gender and that's the issue.</v>

1578
00:46:23.590 --> 00:46:23.680
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1579
00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:26.900
<v Speaker 3>but I'm saying supposing just supposing feminism was defined this,</v>

1580
00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:28.080
<v Speaker 3>that as something that's in,</v>

1581
00:46:28.250 --> 00:46:31.950
<v Speaker 3>it's a movement that's an or an ideology that's in opposition to gender</v>

1582
00:46:31.951 --> 00:46:33.480
<v Speaker 3>inequality or patriarchy or whatever it is,</v>

1583
00:46:33.481 --> 00:46:34.050
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1584
00:46:34.050 --> 00:46:34.351
<v Speaker 3>Then,</v>

1585
00:46:34.351 --> 00:46:35.010
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1586
00:46:35.010 --> 00:46:36.120
<v Speaker 3>it unifies everybody.</v>

1587
00:46:36.450 --> 00:46:38.790
<v Speaker 3>But the moment it starts standing for something like,</v>

1588
00:46:38.791 --> 00:46:39.031
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1589
00:46:39.031 --> 00:46:41.820
<v Speaker 3>you're not a feminist if you're not pro choice or you're not a feminist,</v>

1590
00:46:41.821 --> 00:46:45.990
<v Speaker 3>if you believe that males and females are not exactly the same or</v>

1591
00:46:46.290 --> 00:46:47.071
<v Speaker 3>psychologically,</v>

1592
00:46:47.071 --> 00:46:50.610
<v Speaker 3>or if you don't subscribe to this sort of gender,</v>

1593
00:46:50.611 --> 00:46:53.400
<v Speaker 3>sociology theory or whatever it is,</v>

1594
00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:56.550
<v Speaker 3>the moment you start excluding people based on that and you start talking about</v>

1595
00:46:56.551 --> 00:47:00.360
<v Speaker 3>what feminism stands for rather than what it stands against,</v>

1596
00:47:00.690 --> 00:47:02.190
<v Speaker 3>then you start getting fragmentation.</v>

1597
00:47:02.270 --> 00:47:06.070
<v Speaker 3>And I kind of feel the same way with the religion and a lot of atheist.</v>

1598
00:47:06.090 --> 00:47:06.360
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1599
00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:09.540
<v Speaker 3>I liked the anti theist position that when you're,</v>

1600
00:47:09.570 --> 00:47:10.710
<v Speaker 3>when you're opposed to,</v>

1601
00:47:11.690 --> 00:47:11.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1602
00:47:11.910 --> 00:47:15.240
<v Speaker 3>the idea of religion and faith and believing things without evidence,</v>

1603
00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:16.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1604
00:47:16.130 --> 00:47:19.920
<v Speaker 3>doing things for no other reason apart from the fact that it was written in a</v>

1605
00:47:19.921 --> 00:47:21.990
<v Speaker 3>book 2000 years ago.</v>

1606
00:47:23.130 --> 00:47:24.210
<v Speaker 3>If you're a post to that,</v>

1607
00:47:24.450 --> 00:47:27.630
<v Speaker 3>you have a lot of people who will be part of your movement.</v>

1608
00:47:27.631 --> 00:47:28.740
<v Speaker 3>But the moment you start saying,</v>

1609
00:47:28.741 --> 00:47:28.900
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1610
00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:30.340
<v Speaker 3>atheism stands for being,</v>

1611
00:47:30.790 --> 00:47:31.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1612
00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:35.410
<v Speaker 1>having this political stance on something where it means that you have to like</v>

1613
00:47:35.411 --> 00:47:38.170
<v Speaker 1>what you have to agree with what Glenn Greenwald says,</v>

1614
00:47:38.610 --> 00:47:42.220
<v Speaker 1>being a social justice and then you start excuse excluding people so well.</v>

1615
00:47:42.221 --> 00:47:43.300
<v Speaker 1>Then you get into atheism.</v>

1616
00:47:43.301 --> 00:47:43.780
<v Speaker 1>Plus,</v>

1617
00:47:43.780 --> 00:47:44.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1618
00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:45.580
<v Speaker 1>when atheism pluses,</v>

1619
00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:46.700
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1620
00:47:46.700 --> 00:47:49.510
<v Speaker 1>I do like I had someone explained it to me briefly,</v>

1621
00:47:49.511 --> 00:47:51.730
<v Speaker 1>but I never really followed up on it.</v>

1622
00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:55.900
<v Speaker 1>It's a hilarious group of social retards that have decided to make a religion</v>

1623
00:47:55.901 --> 00:47:56.711
<v Speaker 1>out of atheism.</v>

1624
00:47:56.711 --> 00:48:01.711
<v Speaker 1>And so they've connected atheism with a system or a group of social values and</v>

1625
00:48:01.841 --> 00:48:04.840
<v Speaker 1>ethics and attached this idea.</v>

1626
00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:08.320
<v Speaker 1>It was just a lack of belief in a deity to,</v>

1627
00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:09.310
<v Speaker 1>on top of that,</v>

1628
00:48:09.340 --> 00:48:14.320
<v Speaker 1>all these things that anyone with any ethics are ordinarily automatically</v>

1629
00:48:14.321 --> 00:48:15.154
<v Speaker 1>believes in,</v>

1630
00:48:15.330 --> 00:48:16.120
<v Speaker 1>like a lack,</v>

1631
00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:18.340
<v Speaker 1>like sexual discrimination,</v>

1632
00:48:18.370 --> 00:48:19.270
<v Speaker 1>gender discrimination,</v>

1633
00:48:19.271 --> 00:48:20.110
<v Speaker 1>racial discrimination,</v>

1634
00:48:20.111 --> 00:48:24.070
<v Speaker 1>all those things that like moral ethical people already disagree with.</v>

1635
00:48:24.190 --> 00:48:27.580
<v Speaker 1>They've attached that to atheism and called it atheism plus.</v>

1636
00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:28.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1637
00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:28.391
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1638
00:48:28.391 --> 00:48:28.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1639
00:48:28.550 --> 00:48:29.383
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1640
00:48:29.830 --> 00:48:31.210
<v Speaker 1>against all those other things,</v>

1641
00:48:31.211 --> 00:48:33.460
<v Speaker 1>but now now it becomes a group,</v>

1642
00:48:33.490 --> 00:48:34.450
<v Speaker 1>like an ideology.</v>

1643
00:48:34.451 --> 00:48:39.160
<v Speaker 1>It's essentially in a way like a religion because to ascribe to atheism.</v>

1644
00:48:39.161 --> 00:48:41.680
<v Speaker 1>Plus you have to be someone who,</v>

1645
00:48:41.710 --> 00:48:42.543
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1646
00:48:42.910 --> 00:48:46.000
<v Speaker 1>these people that go to these conferences and like you'll listen to speeches,</v>

1647
00:48:46.690 --> 00:48:48.010
<v Speaker 1>he's fucking droning,</v>

1648
00:48:48.250 --> 00:48:49.170
<v Speaker 1>boring speech.</v>

1649
00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:54.720
<v Speaker 1>They should call atheism plus Dha because anyone who's intelligent already</v>

1650
00:48:55.570 --> 00:48:55.961
<v Speaker 1>thinks,</v>

1651
00:48:55.961 --> 00:48:56.200
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1652
00:48:56.200 --> 00:48:57.070
<v Speaker 1>they're your course.</v>

1653
00:48:57.071 --> 00:48:58.330
<v Speaker 1>If you're a balanced person,</v>

1654
00:48:58.540 --> 00:49:00.640
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't believe in racial discrimination.</v>

1655
00:49:00.641 --> 00:49:02.860
<v Speaker 1>Of course you wouldn't support sexual discrimination.</v>

1656
00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:04.360
<v Speaker 1>Of course you wouldn't support,</v>

1657
00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:05.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1658
00:49:05.470 --> 00:49:06.340
<v Speaker 1>fill in the blank,</v>

1659
00:49:06.341 --> 00:49:06.641
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1660
00:49:06.641 --> 00:49:08.680
<v Speaker 1>of course you would be pro women's rights.</v>

1661
00:49:08.681 --> 00:49:09.910
<v Speaker 1>Of course you'd be pro,</v>

1662
00:49:10.300 --> 00:49:10.871
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1663
00:49:10.871 --> 00:49:15.871
<v Speaker 1>there's a whole group of desires that they have or I ideological desires that</v>

1664
00:49:17.621 --> 00:49:19.750
<v Speaker 1>they have attached to this idea of,</v>

1665
00:49:20.060 --> 00:49:20.893
<v Speaker 1>of atheism.</v>

1666
00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:22.390
<v Speaker 1>It's a hilarious.</v>

1667
00:49:22.950 --> 00:49:24.200
<v Speaker 1>I think that's exactly that,</v>

1668
00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:24.491
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1669
00:49:24.491 --> 00:49:26.260
<v Speaker 1>that was the point I was making at the moment.</v>

1670
00:49:26.261 --> 00:49:30.460
<v Speaker 1>Atheism starts standing for something beyond just not believing in a god.</v>

1671
00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:33.280
<v Speaker 1>The moment that happens,</v>

1672
00:49:33.310 --> 00:49:37.150
<v Speaker 1>you start know there's this fragmentation starts to take place.</v>

1673
00:49:37.540 --> 00:49:38.140
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1674
00:49:38.140 --> 00:49:38.973
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1675
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:39.540
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

1676
00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:42.520
<v Speaker 1>I just think that it's better like the anti theist position,</v>

1677
00:49:42.521 --> 00:49:43.301
<v Speaker 1>just the idea that,</v>

1678
00:49:43.301 --> 00:49:44.134
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1679
00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:45.640
<v Speaker 1>it's been many,</v>

1680
00:49:45.641 --> 00:49:48.580
<v Speaker 1>many years and now this whole religion thing,</v>

1681
00:49:48.610 --> 00:49:51.550
<v Speaker 1>like a respect for religion and all the stuff that's being done in the name of</v>

1682
00:49:51.551 --> 00:49:51.790
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1683
00:49:51.790 --> 00:49:52.541
<v Speaker 1>this is kind of enough.</v>

1684
00:49:52.541 --> 00:49:53.470
<v Speaker 1>So all of us are rational.</v>

1685
00:49:53.471 --> 00:49:55.660
<v Speaker 1>People are going to take a position against this,</v>

1686
00:49:56.040 --> 00:49:56.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1687
00:49:56.380 --> 00:49:57.213
<v Speaker 1>find another,</v>

1688
00:49:57.760 --> 00:50:00.680
<v Speaker 1>find something else to guide your actions apart from these,</v>

1689
00:50:00.681 --> 00:50:00.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1690
00:50:00.970 --> 00:50:04.930
<v Speaker 1>sort of archaic social and legal codes.</v>

1691
00:50:05.990 --> 00:50:06.791
<v Speaker 1>And if we had that position,</v>

1692
00:50:06.791 --> 00:50:09.430
<v Speaker 1>you can have people from all kinds of,</v>

1693
00:50:09.490 --> 00:50:10.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1694
00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:10.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1695
00:50:10.990 --> 00:50:14.920
<v Speaker 1>subscribe to all kinds of belief systems even to come and join your cause.</v>

1696
00:50:15.370 --> 00:50:16.690
<v Speaker 1>But the moment you start saying,</v>

1697
00:50:16.691 --> 00:50:16.961
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1698
00:50:16.961 --> 00:50:17.741
<v Speaker 1>if you're an atheist,</v>

1699
00:50:17.741 --> 00:50:19.270
<v Speaker 1>then you have to stand for this,</v>

1700
00:50:19.570 --> 00:50:20.890
<v Speaker 1>but you have to be pro choice.</v>

1701
00:50:21.100 --> 00:50:24.460
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of pro life atheists that are still atheist,</v>

1702
00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:26.433
<v Speaker 1>so you can't.</v>

1703
00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:27.201
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1704
00:50:27.201 --> 00:50:28.280
<v Speaker 1>that's why they call it atheism</v>

1705
00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:30.020
<v Speaker 4>plus in their ideas.</v>

1706
00:50:30.021 --> 00:50:31.730
<v Speaker 4>But if you listen to them talk,</v>

1707
00:50:31.731 --> 00:50:32.600
<v Speaker 4>it's a lot of these really,</v>

1708
00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:36.560
<v Speaker 4>really weak guys who just go looking for social brownie points and then trying</v>

1709
00:50:36.561 --> 00:50:41.480
<v Speaker 4>to get women to love them by standing so powerfully and strong in favor of</v>

1710
00:50:41.481 --> 00:50:42.081
<v Speaker 4>equality.</v>

1711
00:50:42.081 --> 00:50:42.914
<v Speaker 4>It's like there's.</v>

1712
00:50:42.970 --> 00:50:46.160
<v Speaker 4>There's a certain aspect of feminism that's sort of in,</v>

1713
00:50:46.161 --> 00:50:46.820
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

1714
00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:51.820
<v Speaker 4>in sort of engage themselves with atheism and they've kind of embedded into it.</v>

1715
00:50:53.241 --> 00:50:57.650
<v Speaker 4>And these radical feminist ideas have also like become a part of atheism.</v>

1716
00:50:57.651 --> 00:51:02.651
<v Speaker 4>Plus it's very strange to listen to what they say and completely intolerant of</v>

1717
00:51:03.381 --> 00:51:08.210
<v Speaker 4>other people's ideas and aggressive in attacking and doxing and going after</v>

1718
00:51:08.211 --> 00:51:10.970
<v Speaker 4>people who disagree or who they think have,</v>

1719
00:51:11.340 --> 00:51:11.630
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1720
00:51:11.630 --> 00:51:16.630
<v Speaker 4>in some way or another just stood out against what their ideas are.</v>

1721
00:51:17.380 --> 00:51:22.380
<v Speaker 4>That I have seen a lot and it's a aggressive recently thinking that all these</v>

1722
00:51:22.761 --> 00:51:23.594
<v Speaker 4>labels,</v>

1723
00:51:24.190 --> 00:51:24.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1724
00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:29.480
<v Speaker 3>when you see what are some of the atheists activists that are out there,</v>

1725
00:51:29.491 --> 00:51:29.971
<v Speaker 3>especially now,</v>

1726
00:51:29.971 --> 00:51:30.920
<v Speaker 3>there's such a big moment.</v>

1727
00:51:30.930 --> 00:51:31.770
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of really,</v>

1728
00:51:31.771 --> 00:51:34.280
<v Speaker 3>really angry people and um,</v>

1729
00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:36.320
<v Speaker 4>and for good reason in some ways.</v>

1730
00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:36.920
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1731
00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:37.753
<v Speaker 4>I understand.</v>

1732
00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:38.961
<v Speaker 4>I mean look,</v>

1733
00:51:38.961 --> 00:51:40.280
<v Speaker 4>real religious ideology,</v>

1734
00:51:40.281 --> 00:51:44.360
<v Speaker 4>especially radical radical religious fundamentalism has done horrible damage to</v>

1735
00:51:44.361 --> 00:51:47.620
<v Speaker 4>people and there's a lot of people that grew up in that and there they have an</v>

1736
00:51:47.660 --> 00:51:49.400
<v Speaker 4>extreme backlash against it.</v>

1737
00:51:49.401 --> 00:51:52.670
<v Speaker 4>And so they're angry because of that and know I'm completely.</v>

1738
00:51:52.671 --> 00:51:55.550
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying that they shouldn't be totally with that.</v>

1739
00:51:55.551 --> 00:51:56.380
<v Speaker 4>I mean if I</v>

1740
00:51:56.380 --> 00:51:58.180
<v Speaker 3>had the life that I on Hirsi Ali did,</v>

1741
00:51:58.720 --> 00:51:58.961
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1742
00:51:58.961 --> 00:52:00.090
<v Speaker 3>where I grew up and went,</v>

1743
00:52:00.290 --> 00:52:03.190
<v Speaker 3>underwent genital mutilation and yet all of these things,</v>

1744
00:52:03.580 --> 00:52:04.210
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1745
00:52:04.210 --> 00:52:05.043
<v Speaker 3>as a woman.</v>

1746
00:52:05.710 --> 00:52:08.830
<v Speaker 3>And I would be angry too if I was impressed by that.</v>

1747
00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:09.110
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1748
00:52:09.110 --> 00:52:09.300
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1749
00:52:09.300 --> 00:52:11.290
<v Speaker 3>I have a roof by the way,</v>

1750
00:52:11.291 --> 00:52:11.501
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1751
00:52:11.501 --> 00:52:11.620
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1752
00:52:11.620 --> 00:52:13.570
<v Speaker 3>but the blogger in Saudi Arabia,</v>

1753
00:52:14.140 --> 00:52:15.260
<v Speaker 3>which one is the,</v>

1754
00:52:15.430 --> 00:52:15.980
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1755
00:52:15.980 --> 00:52:18.030
<v Speaker 3>a blogger that they've jailed and senator even,</v>

1756
00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:19.240
<v Speaker 3>they've been like lashing him.</v>

1757
00:52:19.980 --> 00:52:20.813
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1758
00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:22.150
<v Speaker 3>they lost them 50 times.</v>

1759
00:52:22.300 --> 00:52:22.511
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1760
00:52:22.511 --> 00:52:23.090
<v Speaker 3>So I'll tell you,</v>

1761
00:52:23.090 --> 00:52:23.923
<v Speaker 3>tell me sir.</v>

1762
00:52:24.340 --> 00:52:24.860
<v Speaker 3>So he,</v>

1763
00:52:24.860 --> 00:52:25.693
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1764
00:52:25.990 --> 00:52:30.340
<v Speaker 3>it's actually someone that I know my girlfriend's really good friends with his</v>

1765
00:52:30.490 --> 00:52:32.170
<v Speaker 3>wife and his kids and everything,</v>

1766
00:52:32.171 --> 00:52:34.300
<v Speaker 3>so we know them personally.</v>

1767
00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:35.553
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1768
00:52:35.950 --> 00:52:38.470
<v Speaker 3>he started a website called free Saudi liberals.</v>

1769
00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:41.980
<v Speaker 3>So you wanted to start talking about liberalism and sort of just,</v>

1770
00:52:42.010 --> 00:52:42.191
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1771
00:52:42.191 --> 00:52:43.090
<v Speaker 3>different innovative,</v>

1772
00:52:44.440 --> 00:52:49.440
<v Speaker 3>non status quo ideas in Saudi Arabia and he essentially got a jail sentence for</v>

1773
00:52:52.271 --> 00:52:54.190
<v Speaker 3>10 years with a thousand lashes.</v>

1774
00:52:54.820 --> 00:52:57.460
<v Speaker 3>So they would take them out into the public,</v>

1775
00:52:57.461 --> 00:52:58.690
<v Speaker 3>outside of Moscow after Friday.</v>

1776
00:52:58.691 --> 00:53:00.040
<v Speaker 3>Prayers and of folly,</v>

1777
00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:01.013
<v Speaker 3>Moscon Jetta.</v>

1778
00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:02.200
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1779
00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:07.440
<v Speaker 3>they just take a cane and they lashed him 50 times every Friday until the 1000</v>

1780
00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:09.550
<v Speaker 3>lashes are complete.</v>

1781
00:53:09.730 --> 00:53:11.650
<v Speaker 3>So they did the first set,</v>

1782
00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:13.630
<v Speaker 3>think about four or five weeks ago.</v>

1783
00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:15.280
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1784
00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:15.491
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1785
00:53:15.491 --> 00:53:16.720
<v Speaker 3>we all started writing about it.</v>

1786
00:53:17.020 --> 00:53:19.810
<v Speaker 3>All of us really became a huge story.</v>

1787
00:53:20.620 --> 00:53:23.860
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of pressure and then the Charlie Hebdo attacks happened and the</v>

1788
00:53:23.861 --> 00:53:28.861
<v Speaker 3>Saudi ambassador was in the free speech rally in Paris and in a,</v>

1789
00:53:29.120 --> 00:53:32.820
<v Speaker 3>I think that was on a Sunday and they'd actually last riff on Friday</v>

1790
00:53:34.350 --> 00:53:35.470
<v Speaker 3>and he was in free speech rally.</v>

1791
00:53:35.471 --> 00:53:36.241
<v Speaker 3>So a lot of people wrote.</v>

1792
00:53:36.241 --> 00:53:36.730
<v Speaker 3>I wrote,</v>

1793
00:53:36.730 --> 00:53:38.600
<v Speaker 3>I wrote a piece for CNN about it.</v>

1794
00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:41.880
<v Speaker 3>I'm know just talking about the double standard.</v>

1795
00:53:41.910 --> 00:53:44.220
<v Speaker 3>So how many lashes is this received so far?</v>

1796
00:53:44.250 --> 00:53:45.000
<v Speaker 3>50.</v>

1797
00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:47.370
<v Speaker 3>And it was supposed to continue every week,</v>

1798
00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:48.271
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

1799
00:53:48.271 --> 00:53:49.104
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1800
00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:53.440
<v Speaker 3>he had a medical review and the doctors said that he's not fit to be lasting and</v>

1801
00:53:53.450 --> 00:53:53.791
<v Speaker 3>next week,</v>

1802
00:53:53.791 --> 00:53:58.320
<v Speaker 3>which is fucking bizarre because basically they said that his wounds have healed</v>

1803
00:53:58.321 --> 00:53:59.154
<v Speaker 3>enough.</v>

1804
00:53:59.400 --> 00:53:59.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1805
00:53:59.730 --> 00:54:01.590
<v Speaker 3>Critical new wounds to create new ones.</v>

1806
00:54:01.650 --> 00:54:01.801
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1807
00:54:01.801 --> 00:54:06.801
<v Speaker 3>So fucking close up before we rip them open again and lashed with what are they</v>

1808
00:54:07.441 --> 00:54:08.700
<v Speaker 3>using to beat them with?</v>

1809
00:54:08.910 --> 00:54:09.840
<v Speaker 3>They use a cane.</v>

1810
00:54:09.930 --> 00:54:12.860
<v Speaker 3>They use a really sharp bamboo cane with like edges to it,</v>

1811
00:54:12.861 --> 00:54:14.160
<v Speaker 3>like what they used in Singapore.</v>

1812
00:54:14.370 --> 00:54:15.510
<v Speaker 3>What I know about it is,</v>

1813
00:54:15.570 --> 00:54:15.781
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1814
00:54:15.781 --> 00:54:16.890
<v Speaker 3>it's a cane like that,</v>

1815
00:54:16.891 --> 00:54:17.490
<v Speaker 3>but it's got.</v>

1816
00:54:17.490 --> 00:54:18.291
<v Speaker 3>Apparently it's a,</v>

1817
00:54:18.291 --> 00:54:19.410
<v Speaker 3>it's got a very sharp edge,</v>

1818
00:54:19.411 --> 00:54:21.360
<v Speaker 3>so it does catch a slice.</v>

1819
00:54:21.361 --> 00:54:22.650
<v Speaker 3>You Open 50 times,</v>

1820
00:54:22.980 --> 00:54:23.813
<v Speaker 3>50 times,</v>

1821
00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:25.591
<v Speaker 3>so it's,</v>

1822
00:54:25.591 --> 00:54:25.771
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1823
00:54:25.771 --> 00:54:26.820
<v Speaker 3>they don't even have to hit you.</v>

1824
00:54:26.821 --> 00:54:30.570
<v Speaker 3>They can just like lightly and it will still cause cuts on your body,</v>

1825
00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:32.370
<v Speaker 3>but they're beating the shit out of this guy with this.</v>

1826
00:54:32.430 --> 00:54:33.600
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying there's a,</v>

1827
00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:34.301
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

1828
00:54:34.301 --> 00:54:35.280
<v Speaker 3>a distribution.</v>

1829
00:54:35.281 --> 00:54:36.750
<v Speaker 3>You have to distribute it between,</v>

1830
00:54:37.050 --> 00:54:39.000
<v Speaker 3>like the knees all the way up to the upper back.</v>

1831
00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:39.811
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

1832
00:54:39.811 --> 00:54:41.100
<v Speaker 3>So he's scarred for life.</v>

1833
00:54:41.870 --> 00:54:42.840
<v Speaker 3>He scarred and I mean he's,</v>

1834
00:54:42.841 --> 00:54:43.674
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1835
00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:44.380
<v Speaker 3>it was uh,</v>

1836
00:54:44.380 --> 00:54:44.700
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>

1837
00:54:44.700 --> 00:54:46.320
<v Speaker 3>his wife was just really,</v>

1838
00:54:46.321 --> 00:54:47.910
<v Speaker 3>really upset or names and stuff.</v>

1839
00:54:47.911 --> 00:54:48.744
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1840
00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:50.040
<v Speaker 3>after the first lashing,</v>

1841
00:54:50.041 --> 00:54:50.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1842
00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:51.113
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>

1843
00:54:51.300 --> 00:54:52.860
<v Speaker 3>he was in really bad medical condition.</v>

1844
00:54:52.861 --> 00:54:55.020
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't getting any medical help and she just said,</v>

1845
00:54:55.021 --> 00:54:55.351
<v Speaker 3>she's like,</v>

1846
00:54:55.351 --> 00:54:55.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1847
00:54:55.680 --> 00:54:58.110
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he's going to survive it and he's,</v>

1848
00:54:58.400 --> 00:54:59.233
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1849
00:54:59.430 --> 00:55:00.091
<v Speaker 3>when you talk to him,</v>

1850
00:55:00.091 --> 00:55:01.980
<v Speaker 3>he's just like a very gentle,</v>

1851
00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:02.910
<v Speaker 3>very nice,</v>

1852
00:55:02.940 --> 00:55:03.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1853
00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:04.530
<v Speaker 3>thinking kind of guy,</v>

1854
00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:09.560
<v Speaker 3>just very sort of introspective and he's like really more of an intellectual</v>

1855
00:55:10.740 --> 00:55:11.311
<v Speaker 3>kind of person,</v>

1856
00:55:11.311 --> 00:55:14.550
<v Speaker 3>but he's not very physically robust or anything like that.</v>

1857
00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:15.990
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>

1858
00:55:16.020 --> 00:55:16.860
<v Speaker 3>what did he write?</v>

1859
00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:18.220
<v Speaker 3>He wrote,</v>

1860
00:55:18.220 --> 00:55:19.800
<v Speaker 3>I'm a man.</v>

1861
00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:21.600
<v Speaker 3>He just wrote sort of like liberal things.</v>

1862
00:55:21.601 --> 00:55:25.620
<v Speaker 3>He started talking about how her religion and politics should be separate.</v>

1863
00:55:25.820 --> 00:55:27.420
<v Speaker 3>Just the basis of secularism.</v>

1864
00:55:28.290 --> 00:55:30.240
<v Speaker 3>There was one post that I liked that he wrote,</v>

1865
00:55:30.620 --> 00:55:30.840
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1866
00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:31.600
<v Speaker 3>that was about,</v>

1867
00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:32.433
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1868
00:55:32.730 --> 00:55:33.540
<v Speaker 3>astronomers,</v>

1869
00:55:33.540 --> 00:55:34.291
<v Speaker 3>like there were these,</v>

1870
00:55:34.291 --> 00:55:34.910
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1871
00:55:34.910 --> 00:55:35.460
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1872
00:55:35.460 --> 00:55:36.930
<v Speaker 3>some Saudi cleric,</v>

1873
00:55:37.140 --> 00:55:38.820
<v Speaker 3>religious leader with a lot of influence,</v>

1874
00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:39.721
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1875
00:55:39.721 --> 00:55:42.180
<v Speaker 3>who was essentially saying that,</v>

1876
00:55:42.181 --> 00:55:42.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1877
00:55:42.550 --> 00:55:45.330
<v Speaker 3>I think he said something like traveling to planets as haraam or,</v>

1878
00:55:45.331 --> 00:55:45.600
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1879
00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:47.660
<v Speaker 3>at the zoo saying something about astronomy.</v>

1880
00:55:47.730 --> 00:55:48.350
<v Speaker 3>Her Rom.</v>

1881
00:55:48.350 --> 00:55:48.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1882
00:55:48.750 --> 00:55:49.890
<v Speaker 3>Around being sinful.</v>

1883
00:55:50.590 --> 00:55:51.240
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1884
00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:51.620
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>

1885
00:55:51.620 --> 00:55:52.710
<v Speaker 3>if I remember this correctly,</v>

1886
00:55:52.711 --> 00:55:56.150
<v Speaker 3>and he essentially wrote this really sarcastic thing about Sherry as</v>

1887
00:55:56.400 --> 00:55:57.040
<v Speaker 3>astronomers.</v>

1888
00:55:57.040 --> 00:55:57.361
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>

1889
00:55:57.361 --> 00:55:58.194
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1890
00:55:58.200 --> 00:56:02.130
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know these sharia astronomers existed and we should just forget about</v>

1891
00:56:02.131 --> 00:56:05.760
<v Speaker 3>what all the scientists are saying and what all the tilex scopes do and we</v>

1892
00:56:05.761 --> 00:56:08.910
<v Speaker 3>should just listen to these guys because they have knowledge nobody else has</v>

1893
00:56:08.911 --> 00:56:10.380
<v Speaker 3>from centuries ago.</v>

1894
00:56:10.770 --> 00:56:13.440
<v Speaker 3>So he would write sort of sarcastic things like that now.</v>

1895
00:56:13.470 --> 00:56:16.310
<v Speaker 3>He never openly challenge religion,</v>

1896
00:56:16.311 --> 00:56:16.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1897
00:56:16.490 --> 00:56:17.430
<v Speaker 3>being wrong or anything,</v>

1898
00:56:17.460 --> 00:56:19.770
<v Speaker 3>but he was just an advocate for secularism.</v>

1899
00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:21.120
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1900
00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:21.953
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1901
00:56:22.090 --> 00:56:22.390
<v Speaker 3>and that,</v>

1902
00:56:22.390 --> 00:56:23.360
<v Speaker 3>that's really all he did.</v>

1903
00:56:23.370 --> 00:56:24.203
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1904
00:56:24.470 --> 00:56:25.060
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1905
00:56:25.060 --> 00:56:25.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1906
00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:26.920
<v Speaker 3>people tend to think that like,</v>

1907
00:56:26.921 --> 00:56:27.101
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1908
00:56:27.101 --> 00:56:28.180
<v Speaker 3>what did he really do?</v>

1909
00:56:28.430 --> 00:56:28.811
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1910
00:56:28.811 --> 00:56:30.070
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>

1911
00:56:30.110 --> 00:56:30.943
<v Speaker 3>I can't,</v>

1912
00:56:31.090 --> 00:56:31.660
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1913
00:56:31.660 --> 00:56:32.740
<v Speaker 3>I can't say it any other way.</v>

1914
00:56:32.980 --> 00:56:34.360
<v Speaker 3>The guy who all he did was,</v>

1915
00:56:34.361 --> 00:56:36.700
<v Speaker 3>he just blogged on this thing called free Saudi liberals,</v>

1916
00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:38.940
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1917
00:56:39.190 --> 00:56:41.230
<v Speaker 3>And so Saudi Arabia is another,</v>

1918
00:56:41.231 --> 00:56:42.310
<v Speaker 3>like I grew up there,</v>

1919
00:56:42.760 --> 00:56:42.991
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1920
00:56:42.991 --> 00:56:43.260
<v Speaker 3>That was,</v>

1921
00:56:43.260 --> 00:56:45.220
<v Speaker 3>that was there for about 12 years.</v>

1922
00:56:45.340 --> 00:56:47.260
<v Speaker 3>So I could talk about that forever.</v>

1923
00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:50.080
<v Speaker 3>But King Abdullah just died,</v>

1924
00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:51.273
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1925
00:56:51.610 --> 00:56:53.650
<v Speaker 3>And I always tell people this,</v>

1926
00:56:53.651 --> 00:56:56.980
<v Speaker 3>that the month of James Foley was beheaded in,</v>

1927
00:56:56.990 --> 00:56:57.823
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1928
00:56:57.850 --> 00:56:58.930
<v Speaker 3>August 2014,</v>

1929
00:56:58.931 --> 00:57:00.700
<v Speaker 3>that same month a,</v>

1930
00:57:00.701 --> 00:57:03.490
<v Speaker 3>Saudi Arabia beheaded 19 people.</v>

1931
00:57:03.790 --> 00:57:05.620
<v Speaker 3>And it wasn't just for murder,</v>

1932
00:57:06.700 --> 00:57:07.270
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1933
00:57:07.270 --> 00:57:07.960
<v Speaker 3>there were murdered.</v>

1934
00:57:07.960 --> 00:57:10.900
<v Speaker 3>They were beheaded for sorcery,</v>

1935
00:57:11.470 --> 00:57:12.760
<v Speaker 3>for cannabis smuggling,</v>

1936
00:57:12.790 --> 00:57:13.623
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1937
00:57:13.740 --> 00:57:15.190
<v Speaker 3>will probably resonate with you a little bit.</v>

1938
00:57:15.720 --> 00:57:16.360
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1939
00:57:16.360 --> 00:57:19.630
<v Speaker 3>all kinds of crimes that are not really crime.</v>

1940
00:57:19.720 --> 00:57:20.800
<v Speaker 3>Both of those resonated.</v>

1941
00:57:20.801 --> 00:57:21.910
<v Speaker 3>I'm a sorcerer as well.</v>

1942
00:57:22.050 --> 00:57:23.110
<v Speaker 3>I don't like to talk about it,</v>

1943
00:57:23.111 --> 00:57:25.060
<v Speaker 3>but I do a lot of witchcraft.</v>

1944
00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:25.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1945
00:57:25.660 --> 00:57:26.560
<v Speaker 3>My spare time,</v>

1946
00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:30.180
<v Speaker 3>she cats fucking sorcery.</v>

1947
00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:32.740
<v Speaker 3>What does that mean?</v>

1948
00:57:33.470 --> 00:57:35.180
<v Speaker 3>How do you get beheaded for sorcery?</v>

1949
00:57:35.181 --> 00:57:36.160
<v Speaker 3>What is sorcery?</v>

1950
00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:40.150
<v Speaker 3>Up Black Magic doing spells on people.</v>

1951
00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:41.920
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

1952
00:57:42.790 --> 00:57:43.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1953
00:57:43.300 --> 00:57:45.410
<v Speaker 3>Promising people that you can sort of say hi,</v>

1954
00:57:45.430 --> 00:57:46.241
<v Speaker 3>they can't get pregnant.</v>

1955
00:57:46.241 --> 00:57:46.451
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1956
00:57:46.451 --> 00:57:46.661
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1957
00:57:46.661 --> 00:57:48.280
<v Speaker 3>I can get you pregnant.</v>

1958
00:57:48.340 --> 00:57:49.900
<v Speaker 3>God Sorcery,</v>

1959
00:57:49.910 --> 00:57:50.740
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

1960
00:57:50.740 --> 00:57:53.320
<v Speaker 3>Your head cut off for sorcery in Saudi Arabia.</v>

1961
00:57:53.321 --> 00:57:54.220
<v Speaker 3>And that's our allies.</v>

1962
00:57:54.221 --> 00:57:54.520
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1963
00:57:54.520 --> 00:57:55.990
<v Speaker 3>Happening as we speak.</v>

1964
00:57:56.380 --> 00:57:57.213
<v Speaker 3>It's still doing it.</v>

1965
00:57:57.250 --> 00:57:57.941
<v Speaker 3>And it'd be headed,</v>

1966
00:57:57.941 --> 00:57:59.440
<v Speaker 3>I think 10 people in January.</v>

1967
00:57:59.620 --> 00:58:00.730
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

1968
00:58:00.750 --> 00:58:01.583
<v Speaker 3>And these are public.</v>

1969
00:58:01.720 --> 00:58:03.820
<v Speaker 3>These are public beheadings with a sword,</v>

1970
00:58:04.030 --> 00:58:04.720
<v Speaker 3>you know the.</v>

1971
00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:05.553
<v Speaker 3>So you could watch.</v>

1972
00:58:06.130 --> 00:58:06.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1973
00:58:06.490 --> 00:58:07.800
<v Speaker 3>So if I go over there,</v>

1974
00:58:07.990 --> 00:58:09.010
<v Speaker 3>I could watch a beheading.</v>

1975
00:58:09.190 --> 00:58:09.431
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1976
00:58:09.431 --> 00:58:11.740
<v Speaker 3>what they would do if you flew over there and you were a foreigner,</v>

1977
00:58:12.490 --> 00:58:16.300
<v Speaker 3>it would be in the middle of a market place or outside a mosque and they would,</v>

1978
00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:16.900
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1979
00:58:16.900 --> 00:58:18.280
<v Speaker 3>push you up to the front because you're a foreigner.</v>

1980
00:58:18.281 --> 00:58:20.500
<v Speaker 3>They want to show you how they rock it.</v>

1981
00:58:20.680 --> 00:58:20.861
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1982
00:58:20.861 --> 00:58:21.371
<v Speaker 3>You'll see.</v>

1983
00:58:21.371 --> 00:58:25.450
<v Speaker 3>You'll see kids running towards the scene when the executions about to happen or</v>

1984
00:58:25.750 --> 00:58:26.583
<v Speaker 3>is about to happen.</v>

1985
00:58:26.770 --> 00:58:31.390
<v Speaker 3>That the video of rife is online when he was lashed and it's online.</v>

1986
00:58:31.620 --> 00:58:32.310
<v Speaker 3>It's online,</v>

1987
00:58:32.310 --> 00:58:33.910
<v Speaker 3>there's someone actually secretly filmed it,</v>

1988
00:58:34.270 --> 00:58:35.480
<v Speaker 3>but no one really sees.</v>

1989
00:58:35.500 --> 00:58:37.720
<v Speaker 3>You can see people running towards,</v>

1990
00:58:37.770 --> 00:58:38.170
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1991
00:58:38.170 --> 00:58:39.850
<v Speaker 3>where the lashing was about take place.</v>

1992
00:58:39.910 --> 00:58:41.650
<v Speaker 3>How clearly do you see them getting lashed?</v>

1993
00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:44.050
<v Speaker 3>You don't see it very clearly and you know,</v>

1994
00:58:44.051 --> 00:58:44.660
<v Speaker 3>so what happened?</v>

1995
00:58:44.660 --> 00:58:45.440
<v Speaker 3>A Kid?</v>

1996
00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:45.600
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1997
00:58:45.600 --> 00:58:45.701
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1998
00:58:45.701 --> 00:58:46.200
<v Speaker 3>he's not.</v>

1999
00:58:46.200 --> 00:58:46.440
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

2000
00:58:46.440 --> 00:58:47.261
<v Speaker 3>he's clothed.</v>

2001
00:58:47.261 --> 00:58:49.420
<v Speaker 3>And then he's got his hands in shackles.</v>

2002
00:58:49.421 --> 00:58:50.890
<v Speaker 3>He's guys had raised up.</v>

2003
00:58:50.891 --> 00:58:52.660
<v Speaker 3>So they're beating him through the clothes.</v>

2004
00:58:52.900 --> 00:58:56.890
<v Speaker 3>They're beating them through the clouds and from a distance you can't really</v>

2005
00:58:56.950 --> 00:58:59.110
<v Speaker 3>appreciate what it's like because you know,</v>

2006
00:58:59.250 --> 00:59:00.370
<v Speaker 3>the beginning of the cane is really,</v>

2007
00:59:00.371 --> 00:59:00.971
<v Speaker 3>really sharp.</v>

2008
00:59:00.971 --> 00:59:03.430
<v Speaker 3>And so you don't know exactly what happens.</v>

2009
00:59:03.730 --> 00:59:04.090
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2010
00:59:04.090 --> 00:59:04.750
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2011
00:59:04.750 --> 00:59:05.170
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2012
00:59:05.170 --> 00:59:06.280
<v Speaker 3>you can't see it very clearly,</v>

2013
00:59:06.281 --> 00:59:11.281
<v Speaker 3>but the thing that is most striking about that video is the people around it,</v>

2014
00:59:11.721 --> 00:59:14.400
<v Speaker 3>there's like hundreds of normal regular Saudi's,</v>

2015
00:59:14.810 --> 00:59:15.130
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2016
00:59:15.130 --> 00:59:19.450
<v Speaker 3>that are gathered around there cheering afterwards and they all yell Allahu</v>

2017
00:59:19.450 --> 00:59:23.000
<v Speaker 3>Akbar when the lashes are complete and there's little kids like little five,</v>

2018
00:59:23.001 --> 00:59:23.271
<v Speaker 3>six,</v>

2019
00:59:23.271 --> 00:59:27.350
<v Speaker 3>seven year old kids and they're all excitedly running towards the scene and so</v>

2020
00:59:27.351 --> 00:59:28.040
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>

2021
00:59:28.040 --> 00:59:30.560
<v Speaker 3>So these are things that they see in public.</v>

2022
00:59:30.590 --> 00:59:32.390
<v Speaker 3>I mean that not a lot of people here know this.</v>

2023
00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:34.250
<v Speaker 3>There's a in Riyadh,</v>

2024
00:59:34.251 --> 00:59:36.470
<v Speaker 3>the place where they do the public executions,</v>

2025
00:59:36.630 --> 00:59:36.871
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2026
00:59:36.871 --> 00:59:38.840
<v Speaker 3>at least when I was there it was called Chop Chop Square.</v>

2027
00:59:39.170 --> 00:59:42.950
<v Speaker 3>That's what we used to Wyatt Chop Chop Square.</v>

2028
00:59:42.951 --> 00:59:46.750
<v Speaker 3>Was he sort of affectionate term for it?</v>

2029
00:59:46.760 --> 00:59:46.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2030
00:59:46.910 --> 00:59:47.240
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

2031
00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:49.160
<v Speaker 3>there's a market of which there was chop,</v>

2032
00:59:49.161 --> 00:59:49.771
<v Speaker 3>Chop Square.</v>

2033
00:59:49.771 --> 00:59:50.160
<v Speaker 3>And.</v>

2034
00:59:50.160 --> 00:59:52.430
<v Speaker 3>But if you criticize that you're Islamophobic,</v>

2035
00:59:52.670 --> 00:59:53.480
<v Speaker 3>did you know that?</v>

2036
00:59:53.480 --> 00:59:53.691
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2037
00:59:53.691 --> 00:59:54.720
<v Speaker 3>Because then it,</v>

2038
00:59:54.830 --> 00:59:55.663
<v Speaker 3>then they'll say,</v>

2039
00:59:56.100 --> 00:59:56.570
<v Speaker 3>they'll say,</v>

2040
00:59:56.570 --> 00:59:56.721
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2041
00:59:56.721 --> 00:59:58.190
<v Speaker 3>this has nothing to do with Islam.</v>

2042
00:59:58.520 --> 01:00:01.370
<v Speaker 3>And then you'll show them the verses in the Koran that actually say that you can</v>

2043
01:00:01.371 --> 01:00:04.070
<v Speaker 3>be head people for all kinds of things and they'll say,</v>

2044
01:00:04.071 --> 01:00:04.221
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2045
01:00:04.221 --> 01:00:06.320
<v Speaker 3>that's mistranslated misinterpret it.</v>

2046
01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:08.090
<v Speaker 3>And it was at a different time,</v>

2047
01:00:08.091 --> 01:00:09.690
<v Speaker 3>a source context.</v>

2048
01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:12.710
<v Speaker 3>Nineteen people in August,</v>

2049
01:00:12.711 --> 01:00:15.230
<v Speaker 3>the month of James Foley was beheaded by Isis,</v>

2050
01:00:15.231 --> 01:00:16.370
<v Speaker 3>the Saudi government,</v>

2051
01:00:17.250 --> 01:00:18.083
<v Speaker 3>or ally,</v>

2052
01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:22.850
<v Speaker 3>the one that Obama just recently went to pay respects to the king.</v>

2053
01:00:23.150 --> 01:00:25.370
<v Speaker 3>And Fareed Zakaria actually asked him,</v>

2054
01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:26.600
<v Speaker 3>asked Obama about.</v>

2055
01:00:27.140 --> 01:00:27.351
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

2056
01:00:27.351 --> 01:00:30.830
<v Speaker 3>are you going to mention the blogger that they have jailed?</v>

2057
01:00:31.180 --> 01:00:31.521
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2058
01:00:31.521 --> 01:00:32.420
<v Speaker 3>and then he didn't.</v>

2059
01:00:32.690 --> 01:00:33.111
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

2060
01:00:33.111 --> 01:00:33.411
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2061
01:00:33.411 --> 01:00:33.681
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2062
01:00:33.681 --> 01:00:35.720
<v Speaker 3>right now I'm just going to pay respects to the king,</v>

2063
01:00:36.410 --> 01:00:36.711
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

2064
01:00:36.711 --> 01:00:37.110
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

2065
01:00:37.110 --> 01:00:37.520
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2066
01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:38.780
<v Speaker 3>with human rights abuses,</v>

2067
01:00:38.781 --> 01:00:38.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2068
01:00:38.900 --> 01:00:39.591
<v Speaker 3>with our allies,</v>

2069
01:00:39.591 --> 01:00:41.270
<v Speaker 3>it's very tough to have that dialogue.</v>

2070
01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:43.740
<v Speaker 1>What kind of fucking allies are that?</v>

2071
01:00:43.741 --> 01:00:45.460
<v Speaker 1>It's like having a friend who has a slave.</v>

2072
01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:46.011
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>

2073
01:00:46.011 --> 01:00:46.841
<v Speaker 1>I really love the dude.</v>

2074
01:00:46.841 --> 01:00:48.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to talk to him about his slaves,</v>

2075
01:00:48.281 --> 01:00:50.920
<v Speaker 1>but he's got this guy shackled up in his basement and yeah,</v>

2076
01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:52.390
<v Speaker 1>guys digging holes for him.</v>

2077
01:00:52.810 --> 01:00:53.680
<v Speaker 1>He's a good dude though.</v>

2078
01:00:53.681 --> 01:00:54.451
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to talk to him,</v>

2079
01:00:54.451 --> 01:00:54.661
<v Speaker 1>bobby,</v>

2080
01:00:54.661 --> 01:00:55.151
<v Speaker 1>he's my friend.</v>

2081
01:00:55.151 --> 01:00:55.984
<v Speaker 1>We're going to barbecue.</v>

2082
01:00:56.330 --> 01:00:56.560
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2083
01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:58.480
<v Speaker 1>what they did was King Abdullah is,</v>

2084
01:00:58.630 --> 01:00:59.200
<v Speaker 1>he's a little bit,</v>

2085
01:00:59.200 --> 01:00:59.220
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

2086
01:00:59.220 --> 01:01:00.053
<v Speaker 3>like the pope,</v>

2087
01:01:00.060 --> 01:01:00.893
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2088
01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:01.960
<v Speaker 3>he's a,</v>

2089
01:01:02.770 --> 01:01:06.090
<v Speaker 3>he just says something that's really common sense to the rest of us.</v>

2090
01:01:06.390 --> 01:01:07.223
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2091
01:01:07.230 --> 01:01:07.561
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

2092
01:01:07.561 --> 01:01:09.120
<v Speaker 3>I think women should be allowed to vote.</v>

2093
01:01:09.121 --> 01:01:11.400
<v Speaker 3>Will Start doing that in 2015.</v>

2094
01:01:11.790 --> 01:01:13.050
<v Speaker 3>And everybody praises him.</v>

2095
01:01:13.230 --> 01:01:14.520
<v Speaker 3>Like he said something amazing.</v>

2096
01:01:14.580 --> 01:01:14.851
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2097
01:01:14.851 --> 01:01:15.031
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2098
01:01:15.031 --> 01:01:15.864
<v Speaker 3>the pope says,</v>

2099
01:01:16.710 --> 01:01:17.131
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2100
01:01:17.131 --> 01:01:18.480
<v Speaker 3>maybe condoms are okay.</v>

2101
01:01:18.990 --> 01:01:23.600
<v Speaker 3>He gets this sort of disproportionate praise for saying it even though it's a</v>

2102
01:01:23.601 --> 01:01:25.770
<v Speaker 3>rational thing that everybody should.</v>

2103
01:01:25.771 --> 01:01:26.520
<v Speaker 3>So they're,</v>

2104
01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:26.731
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

2105
01:01:26.731 --> 01:01:31.610
<v Speaker 3>they're getting praised and lauded for pretty much a bringing their people know</v>

2106
01:01:32.340 --> 01:01:34.080
<v Speaker 3>forward into the 19th century.</v>

2107
01:01:35.230 --> 01:01:35.881
<v Speaker 3>So there was like,</v>

2108
01:01:35.881 --> 01:01:36.150
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2109
01:01:36.150 --> 01:01:38.130
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad you're not in the 17th century anymore.</v>

2110
01:01:38.131 --> 01:01:39.510
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad you're in the 19th century.</v>

2111
01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:41.960
<v Speaker 3>It's so such a low standard.</v>

2112
01:01:41.961 --> 01:01:43.530
<v Speaker 3>So it's like a really low bar for them.</v>

2113
01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:44.580
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2114
01:01:44.580 --> 01:01:45.450
<v Speaker 3>and so Abdullah,</v>

2115
01:01:45.451 --> 01:01:46.790
<v Speaker 3>I'm working on this story right now.</v>

2116
01:01:46.830 --> 01:01:49.530
<v Speaker 3>Just talk to these two women who,</v>

2117
01:01:49.970 --> 01:01:50.160
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2118
01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:52.440
<v Speaker 3>I saw the story where King Abdullah's own daughters.</v>

2119
01:01:52.620 --> 01:01:55.320
<v Speaker 3>So he's got like a shitload of wives and whole bunch of kids and you know,</v>

2120
01:01:55.380 --> 01:01:56.213
<v Speaker 3>he had this one,</v>

2121
01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:59.430
<v Speaker 3>I think it was a Jordanian wife and he had four daughters with her.</v>

2122
01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:00.511
<v Speaker 3>It didn't have a son,</v>

2123
01:02:00.511 --> 01:02:02.010
<v Speaker 3>so he wasn't happy about that.</v>

2124
01:02:02.490 --> 01:02:03.323
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2125
01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:05.940
<v Speaker 3>he's had them under house arrest,</v>

2126
01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:08.190
<v Speaker 3>imprisoned for 15 years.</v>

2127
01:02:08.700 --> 01:02:09.600
<v Speaker 3>So why?</v>

2128
01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:13.830
<v Speaker 3>Because they spoke up about a male guardianship.</v>

2129
01:02:13.831 --> 01:02:18.330
<v Speaker 3>There's a law in Saudi Arabia at that says that women are not allowed to do</v>

2130
01:02:18.331 --> 01:02:23.331
<v Speaker 3>anything without permission of a male guardian like travel work.</v>

2131
01:02:23.730 --> 01:02:24.330
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

2132
01:02:24.330 --> 01:02:24.511
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2133
01:02:24.511 --> 01:02:26.400
<v Speaker 3>They can have some things that can't even do with the permit.</v>

2134
01:02:26.510 --> 01:02:26.970
<v Speaker 3>They can.</v>

2135
01:02:26.970 --> 01:02:28.140
<v Speaker 3>They're not allowed to drive.</v>

2136
01:02:28.710 --> 01:02:28.951
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2137
01:02:28.951 --> 01:02:29.430
<v Speaker 3>I've heard that.</v>

2138
01:02:29.430 --> 01:02:33.120
<v Speaker 3>So they can't do that even with permission of a male guardian,</v>

2139
01:02:33.121 --> 01:02:34.920
<v Speaker 3>but pretty much anything else,</v>

2140
01:02:34.921 --> 01:02:37.740
<v Speaker 3>whether it's a working or traveling or any of that stuff,</v>

2141
01:02:37.741 --> 01:02:42.741
<v Speaker 3>that they can't do it without express permission of a male guardian.</v>

2142
01:02:43.740 --> 01:02:48.030
<v Speaker 3>So they spoke out about it because their guardian was there.</v>

2143
01:02:48.031 --> 01:02:50.250
<v Speaker 3>Dad was a king who they barely even knew.</v>

2144
01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:51.713
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2145
01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:53.460
<v Speaker 3>their mother,</v>

2146
01:02:53.740 --> 01:02:54.180
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2147
01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:54.870
<v Speaker 3>She was,</v>

2148
01:02:54.870 --> 01:02:55.830
<v Speaker 3>she's also female.</v>

2149
01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:58.770
<v Speaker 3>So it really restricted a lot of things that they could do.</v>

2150
01:02:58.980 --> 01:03:01.880
<v Speaker 3>So they started talking about gender discrimination,</v>

2151
01:03:01.881 --> 01:03:02.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2152
01:03:02.150 --> 01:03:02.983
<v Speaker 3>shoes,</v>

2153
01:03:03.030 --> 01:03:03.211
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2154
01:03:03.211 --> 01:03:08.130
<v Speaker 3>the situation of women in Saudi Arabia and they did an interview in 2013 and</v>

2155
01:03:08.131 --> 01:03:09.000
<v Speaker 3>it's online,</v>

2156
01:03:09.001 --> 01:03:11.170
<v Speaker 3>it's a buy with Russia today with Rt.</v>

2157
01:03:11.540 --> 01:03:12.270
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2158
01:03:12.270 --> 01:03:13.710
<v Speaker 3>I think that's what it stands for.</v>

2159
01:03:13.711 --> 01:03:14.544
<v Speaker 3>RUssia today.</v>

2160
01:03:14.610 --> 01:03:15.420
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2161
01:03:15.420 --> 01:03:15.960
<v Speaker 3>and they,</v>

2162
01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:19.290
<v Speaker 3>they were able to get a skype connection and do this interview and they spoke</v>

2163
01:03:19.291 --> 01:03:21.750
<v Speaker 3>out and after that nobody really heard from them again.</v>

2164
01:03:21.751 --> 01:03:23.430
<v Speaker 3>They didn't do any other interviews.</v>

2165
01:03:24.090 --> 01:03:26.150
<v Speaker 3>So I actually</v>

2166
01:03:27.790 --> 01:03:28.660
<v Speaker 3>got in touch with I.</v>

2167
01:03:29.310 --> 01:03:32.550
<v Speaker 3>So here's where my connection happened is I went to a school called monarchal</v>

2168
01:03:32.551 --> 01:03:33.180
<v Speaker 3>riad,</v>

2169
01:03:33.180 --> 01:03:38.180
<v Speaker 3>whIch was like an english medium school for foreigners and saudis as well in</v>

2170
01:03:39.330 --> 01:03:40.163
<v Speaker 3>riyadh.</v>

2171
01:03:40.350 --> 01:03:45.350
<v Speaker 3>And she was in the girl's branch and I knew these two girls who were in the</v>

2172
01:03:46.411 --> 01:03:48.420
<v Speaker 3>girl's branch who went to school with her,</v>

2173
01:03:48.421 --> 01:03:50.490
<v Speaker 3>who were good friends with one of the daughters,</v>

2174
01:03:50.491 --> 01:03:51.181
<v Speaker 3>the youngest one,</v>

2175
01:03:51.181 --> 01:03:52.140

2179
01:03:57.091 --> 01:03:57.781

01:04:52.020 --> 01:04:53.840
<v Speaker 3>this is a guy who sanctioned all those beheadings.</v>

2210
01:04:53.850 --> 01:04:54.031
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2211
01:04:54.031 --> 01:04:54.320
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2212
01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:59.320
<v Speaker 3>he can stop that shit if he wants to have the sorcery beheadings and the lashing</v>

2213
01:04:59.371 --> 01:05:02.080
<v Speaker 3>of bloggers and the imprisonment of his own daughters.</v>

2214
01:05:02.090 --> 01:05:02.923
<v Speaker 3>He could stop that.</v>

2215
01:05:02.940 --> 01:05:04.410
<v Speaker 3>He could have stopped it and he didn't,</v>

2216
01:05:04.770 --> 01:05:05.440
<v Speaker 3>he just said that,</v>

2217
01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:05.870
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2218
01:05:05.870 --> 01:05:08.010
<v Speaker 3>will allow women to vote in 2015,</v>

2219
01:05:08.310 --> 01:05:09.143
<v Speaker 3>fuck.</v>

2220
01:05:09.330 --> 01:05:13.710
<v Speaker 3>But it's like good job will allow women to vote on things that we agree with.</v>

2221
01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:14.633
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

2222
01:05:14.910 --> 01:05:17.590
<v Speaker 3>And you don't really get an option to vote on a lot of things.</v>

2223
01:05:17.591 --> 01:05:17.741
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2224
01:05:17.741 --> 01:05:17.980
<v Speaker 3>do you</v>

2225
01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:18.813
<v Speaker 4>want to king?</v>

2226
01:05:19.270 --> 01:05:19.810
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2227
01:05:19.810 --> 01:05:20.643
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to king.</v>

2228
01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:23.500
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that people should have their head cut off or sorcery?</v>

2229
01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:24.580
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2230
01:05:24.581 --> 01:05:26.380
<v Speaker 4>I would say that that's not progressive.</v>

2231
01:05:26.530 --> 01:05:26.711
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2232
01:05:26.711 --> 01:05:27.200
<v Speaker 3>that's his,</v>

2233
01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:27.710
<v Speaker 3>that's his,</v>

2234
01:05:27.710 --> 01:05:28.231
<v Speaker 3>his own,</v>

2235
01:05:28.231 --> 01:05:29.080
<v Speaker 3>if that's his call.</v>

2236
01:05:29.740 --> 01:05:30.620
<v Speaker 3>So it's a,</v>

2237
01:05:31.430 --> 01:05:33.250
<v Speaker 3>it's a different world out there.</v>

2238
01:05:33.251 --> 01:05:34.210
<v Speaker 3>I think it's,</v>

2239
01:05:34.211 --> 01:05:35.044
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

2240
01:05:35.530 --> 01:05:36.370
<v Speaker 3>that's why it's hard.</v>

2241
01:05:36.371 --> 01:05:36.520
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2242
01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:36.671
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2243
01:05:36.671 --> 01:05:37.390
<v Speaker 3>when you,</v>

2244
01:05:37.390 --> 01:05:40.780
<v Speaker 3>when you're there and you come here and um,</v>

2245
01:05:41.510 --> 01:05:42.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2246
01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:46.360
<v Speaker 3>and when you hear like the sort of the noam chomsky thing or the glenn greenwald</v>

2247
01:05:46.361 --> 01:05:47.194
<v Speaker 3>thing that,</v>

2248
01:05:47.380 --> 01:05:47.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2249
01:05:47.790 --> 01:05:52.100
<v Speaker 3>we need to stop all this llama phobia and yeah,</v>

2250
01:05:52.140 --> 01:05:56.620
<v Speaker 3>when you see the apologist and he immediately cuts you off and it affects people</v>

2251
01:05:56.950 --> 01:06:01.950
<v Speaker 3>like a rife badawi the blogger and it affects people like that actually harms</v>

2252
01:06:02.291 --> 01:06:02.490
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

2253
01:06:02.490 --> 01:06:03.000
<v Speaker 3>I mean the,</v>

2254
01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:03.401
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2255
01:06:03.401 --> 01:06:08.350
<v Speaker 3>the people that we should be getting behind and supporting in those parts of the</v>

2256
01:06:08.351 --> 01:06:10.420
<v Speaker 3>world are the dissidents and the reformers.</v>

2257
01:06:10.421 --> 01:06:10.751
<v Speaker 3>I mean there,</v>

2258
01:06:10.751 --> 01:06:11.011
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

2259
01:06:11.011 --> 01:06:12.460
<v Speaker 3>and there are a lot of them just,</v>

2260
01:06:12.461 --> 01:06:13.000
<v Speaker 3>you can't,</v>

2261
01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.710
<v Speaker 3>you don't hear from them because they can't speak</v>

2262
01:06:14.930 --> 01:06:16.130
<v Speaker 4>well because they're terrified.</v>

2263
01:06:16.131 --> 01:06:21.131
<v Speaker 4>Like the same way people are so terrified of islam that when this charlie hebdo</v>

2264
01:06:21.501 --> 01:06:22.430
<v Speaker 4>thing came out,</v>

2265
01:06:22.460 --> 01:06:23.750
<v Speaker 4>no one,</v>

2266
01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:25.670
<v Speaker 4>no one on the left,</v>

2267
01:06:25.671 --> 01:06:30.430
<v Speaker 4>like actively criticized it or publish those images or you know,</v>

2268
01:06:30.470 --> 01:06:32.300
<v Speaker 4>put it on the front pages of their magazines.</v>

2269
01:06:32.301 --> 01:06:32.561
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>

2270
01:06:32.561 --> 01:06:33.920
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't something that was done.</v>

2271
01:06:34.250 --> 01:06:37.580
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't like something where everyone stood in unity and said,</v>

2272
01:06:37.581 --> 01:06:38.930
<v Speaker 4>this is an everyone's terrified.</v>

2273
01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:41.120
<v Speaker 4>They're terrified that they're going to be next.</v>

2274
01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:42.950
<v Speaker 4>They're going to get their heads cut off,</v>

2275
01:06:42.951 --> 01:06:43.790
<v Speaker 4>they're going to get shot.</v>

2276
01:06:43.820 --> 01:06:47.540
<v Speaker 4>This one is going to storm their office and gunned them down because they also</v>

2277
01:06:47.541 --> 01:06:50.180
<v Speaker 4>published the cartoon and sam harris made a really good point.</v>

2278
01:06:50.181 --> 01:06:55.181
<v Speaker 4>Like it was the one chance that journalists had uniformly to stand up against</v>

2279
01:06:56.571 --> 01:06:59.060
<v Speaker 4>this type of shit and just everyone publish it.</v>

2280
01:06:59.061 --> 01:07:00.230
<v Speaker 4>every fucking magazine,</v>

2281
01:07:00.231 --> 01:07:01.100
<v Speaker 4>every newspaper,</v>

2282
01:07:01.101 --> 01:07:03.350
<v Speaker 4>everyone across the world publish those images,</v>

2283
01:07:03.950 --> 01:07:04.611
<v Speaker 4>but everybody's like,</v>

2284
01:07:04.611 --> 01:07:05.900
<v Speaker 4>fuck that.</v>

2285
01:07:06.070 --> 01:07:07.850
<v Speaker 4>Self preservation took over.</v>

2286
01:07:07.930 --> 01:07:10.040
<v Speaker 3>But did you see that thing on a,</v>

2287
01:07:10.220 --> 01:07:11.370
<v Speaker 3>on sky news?</v>

2288
01:07:11.670 --> 01:07:12.503
<v Speaker 3>There was this,</v>

2289
01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:15.180
<v Speaker 3>there's this woman who was interviewing,</v>

2290
01:07:15.210 --> 01:07:15.611
<v Speaker 3>like when they,</v>

2291
01:07:15.611 --> 01:07:18.920
<v Speaker 3>when they did the reprint and they put the cover of know,</v>

2292
01:07:19.060 --> 01:07:19.621
<v Speaker 3>put them on that,</v>

2293
01:07:19.621 --> 01:07:20.610
<v Speaker 3>on the cover again,</v>

2294
01:07:20.611 --> 01:07:20.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2295
01:07:20.940 --> 01:07:21.773
<v Speaker 3>crying and so on.</v>

2296
01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:23.161
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2297
01:07:23.161 --> 01:07:23.610
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2298
01:07:23.610 --> 01:07:26.850
<v Speaker 3>she was interviewing somebody about that and then the woman that she was</v>

2299
01:07:26.851 --> 01:07:31.320
<v Speaker 3>interviewing started pulling up the paper and showing the cartoon and she</v>

2300
01:07:31.321 --> 01:07:32.280
<v Speaker 3>immediately cut away,</v>

2301
01:07:33.010 --> 01:07:33.210
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

2302
01:07:33.210 --> 01:07:33.601
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry,</v>

2303
01:07:33.601 --> 01:07:37.110
<v Speaker 3>we can't show that and I'm so sorry to anybody who was offended and so on.</v>

2304
01:07:37.390 --> 01:07:39.330
<v Speaker 3>Anybody who was offended at a cartoon,</v>

2305
01:07:40.140 --> 01:07:40.973
<v Speaker 3>that's amazing.</v>

2306
01:07:41.060 --> 01:07:41.401
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2307
01:07:41.401 --> 01:07:42.030
<v Speaker 3>this stuff.</v>

2308
01:07:42.030 --> 01:07:42.863
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2309
01:07:43.020 --> 01:07:43.681
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of,</v>

2310
01:07:43.681 --> 01:07:46.630
<v Speaker 3>other than my mom gets upset at me some time.</v>

2311
01:07:46.631 --> 01:07:46.951
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>

2312
01:07:46.951 --> 01:07:47.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2313
01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:50.820
<v Speaker 3>can you do the criticism but don't do the mockery.</v>

2314
01:07:51.330 --> 01:07:52.163
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

2315
01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:54.630
<v Speaker 3>as I mean I will.</v>

2316
01:07:54.690 --> 01:07:55.431
<v Speaker 3>It just means that,</v>

2317
01:07:55.431 --> 01:07:55.611
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2318
01:07:55.611 --> 01:07:56.640
<v Speaker 3>when you make fun of it,</v>

2319
01:07:56.641 --> 01:07:59.910
<v Speaker 3>when you draw cartoons and it's insulting and it's different now I understand</v>

2320
01:07:59.911 --> 01:08:00.744
<v Speaker 3>where she's coming from,</v>

2321
01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:03.390
<v Speaker 3>but I think mockery is super important.</v>

2322
01:08:03.740 --> 01:08:07.650
<v Speaker 3>Like if you think about the interview or the seth rogen movie,</v>

2323
01:08:08.110 --> 01:08:08.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2324
01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:10.020
<v Speaker 3>you have all of these,</v>

2325
01:08:10.021 --> 01:08:10.650
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2326
01:08:10.650 --> 01:08:11.120
<v Speaker 3>sort of,</v>

2327
01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:11.900
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2328
01:08:11.900 --> 01:08:15.330
<v Speaker 3>journalists and everybody writing all these inquisitive,</v>

2329
01:08:15.610 --> 01:08:16.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2330
01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:20.810
<v Speaker 3>biting critiques of the north korean regime and all that does is that,</v>

2331
01:08:20.890 --> 01:08:21.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2332
01:08:21.210 --> 01:08:24.290
<v Speaker 3>because kim jong un wants to be taken seriously and it gives them,</v>

2333
01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:24.471
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2334
01:08:24.471 --> 01:08:24.711
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

2335
01:08:24.711 --> 01:08:25.070
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2336
01:08:25.070 --> 01:08:25.641
<v Speaker 3>I'm legitimate.</v>

2337
01:08:25.641 --> 01:08:27.440
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's criTicizing me and you know,</v>

2338
01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:28.850
<v Speaker 3>they don't like what I do,</v>

2339
01:08:29.300 --> 01:08:33.110
<v Speaker 3>but when you make a movie with like dick jokes and you know,</v>

2340
01:08:33.111 --> 01:08:34.790
<v Speaker 3>the kind of thing that the interview was,</v>

2341
01:08:35.300 --> 01:08:36.133
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2342
01:08:36.170 --> 01:08:37.310
<v Speaker 3>and you make fun of it.</v>

2343
01:08:37.700 --> 01:08:38.930
<v Speaker 3>He goes ape shit</v>

2344
01:08:39.550 --> 01:08:41.520
<v Speaker 4>because I didn't go ape shit over the,</v>

2345
01:08:41.550 --> 01:08:42.930
<v Speaker 4>the team America movie.</v>

2346
01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:43.980
<v Speaker 4>They did actually.</v>

2347
01:08:44.150 --> 01:08:44.800
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2348
01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:45.010
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2349
01:08:45.010 --> 01:08:45.211
<v Speaker 4>Kim.</v>

2350
01:08:45.211 --> 01:08:48.390
<v Speaker 4>John gale was not happy about it and I wasn't happy,</v>

2351
01:08:48.391 --> 01:08:49.620
<v Speaker 4>but nothing happened.</v>

2352
01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:50.670
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't like,</v>

2353
01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:54.960
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't like what happened here and I'm not sure exactly why they didn't.</v>

2354
01:08:54.961 --> 01:08:55.501
<v Speaker 4>That was a long,</v>

2355
01:08:55.501 --> 01:08:57.600
<v Speaker 4>long time ago and his dad's a little bit more chill.</v>

2356
01:08:58.230 --> 01:08:59.970
<v Speaker 4>Probably some possible.</v>

2357
01:09:00.630 --> 01:09:01.740
<v Speaker 4>He might be more sensitive.</v>

2358
01:09:01.741 --> 01:09:03.060
<v Speaker 4>He's the young one.</v>

2359
01:09:03.090 --> 01:09:03.301
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2360
01:09:03.301 --> 01:09:04.134
<v Speaker 4>maybe.</v>

2361
01:09:04.350 --> 01:09:04.740
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2362
01:09:04.740 --> 01:09:08.520
<v Speaker 4>Maybe feels less legitimate because he just kinda got it from his dad.</v>

2363
01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:10.530
<v Speaker 4>He's a little insecure I think probably,</v>

2364
01:09:10.830 --> 01:09:11.810
<v Speaker 4>but he's got fat.</v>

2365
01:09:11.820 --> 01:09:13.790
<v Speaker 4>Face it.</v>

2366
01:09:14.430 --> 01:09:16.610
<v Speaker 4>Lazy fuck can work up.</v>

2367
01:09:19.330 --> 01:09:19.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2368
01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:20.473
<v Speaker 3>he's a.</v>

2369
01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:22.061
<v Speaker 3>That'S the thing like,</v>

2370
01:09:22.061 --> 01:09:22.721
<v Speaker 3>you know when you,</v>

2371
01:09:22.721 --> 01:09:25.450
<v Speaker 3>when you have a kInd of mockery cartoon,</v>

2372
01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:29.620
<v Speaker 3>like the dick jokes and the cartoons piss these people off a lot more because</v>

2373
01:09:29.860 --> 01:09:31.150
<v Speaker 3>they want to be taken seriously.</v>

2374
01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:35.500
<v Speaker 3>like they have these like they can't do it through ideas because their ideas are</v>

2375
01:09:35.501 --> 01:09:37.690
<v Speaker 3>all bullshit right there.</v>

2376
01:09:37.691 --> 01:09:37.961
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2377
01:09:37.961 --> 01:09:39.330
<v Speaker 3>women can't drive or you know,</v>

2378
01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:42.220
<v Speaker 3>you should be beheaded if you leave the religion or change your mind about what</v>

2379
01:09:42.221 --> 01:09:43.054
<v Speaker 3>you believe and so on.</v>

2380
01:09:43.690 --> 01:09:47.860
<v Speaker 3>Those are the kinds of things that you're going to get people flocking to you</v>

2381
01:09:47.861 --> 01:09:48.260
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

2382
01:09:48.260 --> 01:09:48.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2383
01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:50.380
<v Speaker 3>through rational discourse.</v>

2384
01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:52.870
<v Speaker 3>So know you have to use other means.</v>

2385
01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:54.370
<v Speaker 4>Why Is,</v>

2386
01:09:54.370 --> 01:09:57.910
<v Speaker 4>why is that part of the world so archaic and their beliefs?</v>

2387
01:09:57.911 --> 01:09:59.890
<v Speaker 4>Is it because that's the cradle of civilization?</v>

2388
01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:01.600
<v Speaker 4>That's the oldest form of symbol,</v>

2389
01:10:01.990 --> 01:10:02.980
<v Speaker 4>what we know today,</v>

2390
01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:06.520
<v Speaker 4>like the oldest civilizations that were aware of that we can track.</v>

2391
01:10:06.550 --> 01:10:08.320
<v Speaker 4>It waS like 6,000 plus years ago,</v>

2392
01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:09.610
<v Speaker 4>which is mesopotamia,</v>

2393
01:10:09.611 --> 01:10:10.150
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2394
01:10:10.150 --> 01:10:10.983
<v Speaker 4>The middle east,</v>

2395
01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:12.373
<v Speaker 4>Iraq,</v>

2396
01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:13.720
<v Speaker 4>babylon that,</v>

2397
01:10:13.770 --> 01:10:14.170
<v Speaker 4>those,</v>

2398
01:10:14.170 --> 01:10:15.070
<v Speaker 4>those areas,</v>

2399
01:10:15.071 --> 01:10:20.071
<v Speaker 4>that's where we believe civilization sort of began and those same areas have the</v>

2400
01:10:22.121 --> 01:10:27.121
<v Speaker 4>most archaic form of religion and social justice that their ideas are so</v>

2401
01:10:28.330 --> 01:10:30.880
<v Speaker 4>barbaric in a way or so old.</v>

2402
01:10:31.110 --> 01:10:31.540
<v Speaker 4>There's so.</v>

2403
01:10:31.540 --> 01:10:35.250
<v Speaker 4>I mean the idea that women have to cover themselves and veils and they have to</v>

2404
01:10:35.410 --> 01:10:36.940
<v Speaker 4>these oppressive ideas.</v>

2405
01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:40.570
<v Speaker 4>It's the exact opposite of where the world is heading,</v>

2406
01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:41.980
<v Speaker 4>especially because of the internet.</v>

2407
01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:44.920
<v Speaker 4>There's more and more openness.</v>

2408
01:10:45.100 --> 01:10:46.450
<v Speaker 4>The exchange of information.</v>

2409
01:10:46.451 --> 01:10:49.990
<v Speaker 4>It's quicker than it's ever been before and it's really hard to like hold on to</v>

2410
01:10:49.991 --> 01:10:51.820
<v Speaker 4>like a really stupid idea today.</v>

2411
01:10:52.210 --> 01:10:52.661
<v Speaker 4>Stupid,</v>

2412
01:10:52.661 --> 01:10:53.590
<v Speaker 4>oppressive idea,</v>

2413
01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:55.150
<v Speaker 4>but in that part of the world,</v>

2414
01:10:55.540 --> 01:10:58.630
<v Speaker 4>not so much and it's lIke this momentum,</v>

2415
01:10:58.660 --> 01:11:01.390
<v Speaker 4>the momentum of the past is so strong.</v>

2416
01:11:01.790 --> 01:11:02.380
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2417
01:11:02.380 --> 01:11:02.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2418
01:11:02.630 --> 01:11:03.590
<v Speaker 3>one of the reasons for that,</v>

2419
01:11:03.591 --> 01:11:08.591
<v Speaker 3>that's where I think our role comes in a little bit or the role of the west.</v>

2420
01:11:08.870 --> 01:11:10.610
<v Speaker 3>The though the us is,</v>

2421
01:11:10.611 --> 01:11:11.444
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2422
01:11:12.270 --> 01:11:12.771
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2423
01:11:12.771 --> 01:11:12.891
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2424
01:11:12.891 --> 01:11:16.770
<v Speaker 3>the reason that the saudis are lashing bride for the reason that they're</v>

2425
01:11:16.890 --> 01:11:21.890
<v Speaker 3>beheading people for sorcery has nothing to do with us foreign policy or western</v>

2426
01:11:22.501 --> 01:11:24.300
<v Speaker 3>imperialism or anything like that,</v>

2427
01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:27.480
<v Speaker 3>but the reason they've been able to maintain it,</v>

2428
01:11:28.340 --> 01:11:33.340
<v Speaker 3>reason they can actually keep those archaic legal codes in place and not really</v>

2429
01:11:35.311 --> 01:11:37.290
<v Speaker 3>have to do anything about it is because</v>

2430
01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:39.990
<v Speaker 3>they're very rich.</v>

2431
01:11:40.650 --> 01:11:41.483
<v Speaker 3>They have a lot of oil.</v>

2432
01:11:41.670 --> 01:11:45.030
<v Speaker 3>They don't really need to progress to making that money.</v>

2433
01:11:45.060 --> 01:11:45.551
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

2434
01:11:45.551 --> 01:11:47.430
<v Speaker 3>the reason that they have that is because,</v>

2435
01:11:47.930 --> 01:11:48.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2436
01:11:48.570 --> 01:11:50.010
<v Speaker 3>we've all prop them up.</v>

2437
01:11:50.580 --> 01:11:53.070
<v Speaker 3>We have supported them and you know,</v>

2438
01:11:53.090 --> 01:11:53.310
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2439
01:11:53.310 --> 01:11:54.080
<v Speaker 3>you saw like,</v>

2440
01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:54.990
<v Speaker 3>do you Remember when,</v>

2441
01:11:54.991 --> 01:11:55.620
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2442
01:11:55.620 --> 01:11:58.320
<v Speaker 3>when king abdullah visited Texas,</v>

2443
01:11:58.321 --> 01:11:59.730
<v Speaker 3>I think it was in 2005.</v>

2444
01:11:59.731 --> 01:12:00.750
<v Speaker 3>And then George Bush was</v>

2445
01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:01.880
<v Speaker 4>holding hands with them.</v>

2446
01:12:01.930 --> 01:12:02.170
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2447
01:12:02.170 --> 01:12:03.630
<v Speaker 4>They were walking around holding hands.</v>

2448
01:12:03.660 --> 01:12:04.530
<v Speaker 4>He had to kiss each other.</v>

2449
01:12:04.630 --> 01:12:05.730
<v Speaker 4>She got bullied.</v>

2450
01:12:08.500 --> 01:12:09.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2451
01:12:09.060 --> 01:12:09.820
<v Speaker 3>That's that.</v>

2452
01:12:09.820 --> 01:12:10.301
<v Speaker 3>And they,</v>

2453
01:12:10.301 --> 01:12:11.134
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2454
01:12:11.140 --> 01:12:11.831
<v Speaker 3>so you had that.</v>

2455
01:12:11.831 --> 01:12:14.170
<v Speaker 3>And then in a few years later when obama,</v>

2456
01:12:14.230 --> 01:12:17.500
<v Speaker 3>his first year of his presidency was a ge 20 summit in london.</v>

2457
01:12:18.130 --> 01:12:18.963
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

2458
01:12:19.340 --> 01:12:22.540
<v Speaker 3>and then there was a controversy where everybody thought he bowed to the saudi</v>

2459
01:12:22.541 --> 01:12:23.020
<v Speaker 3>king,</v>

2460
01:12:23.020 --> 01:12:26.110
<v Speaker 3>which he sort of did right when you met him,</v>

2461
01:12:26.111 --> 01:12:26.944
<v Speaker 3>shook his hand and hE,</v>

2462
01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:28.513
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2463
01:12:29.380 --> 01:12:30.430
<v Speaker 3>so that's kind of,</v>

2464
01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:30.641
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2465
01:12:30.641 --> 01:12:33.970
<v Speaker 3>that symbolizes where the us saudi relationship is,</v>

2466
01:12:34.390 --> 01:12:36.190
<v Speaker 3>but they have to do that.</v>

2467
01:12:36.191 --> 01:12:36.761
<v Speaker 3>It's not just,</v>

2468
01:12:36.761 --> 01:12:36.881
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2469
01:12:36.881 --> 01:12:38.900
<v Speaker 3>we can blame the leaders for being allies,</v>

2470
01:12:38.970 --> 01:12:39.551
<v Speaker 3>Saudi Arabia,</v>

2471
01:12:39.551 --> 01:12:40.720
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

2472
01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:41.440
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2473
01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:43.120
<v Speaker 3>it's of the same thing that you see when,</v>

2474
01:12:43.121 --> 01:12:43.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2475
01:12:43.270 --> 01:12:47.620
<v Speaker 3>people driving ground their suv filling up with gas.</v>

2476
01:12:47.621 --> 01:12:51.100
<v Speaker 3>And I will say that every time we fill our cars up with gas,</v>

2477
01:12:51.101 --> 01:12:52.600
<v Speaker 3>we're all bowing to the saudi king.</v>

2478
01:12:53.860 --> 01:12:54.440
<v Speaker 3>Same thing</v>

2479
01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:55.251
<v Speaker 4>with fracking.</v>

2480
01:12:55.251 --> 01:12:57.020
<v Speaker 4>Now it's kind of changed quite a bit.</v>

2481
01:12:57.050 --> 01:12:57.300
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2482
01:12:57.300 --> 01:12:59.450
<v Speaker 4>United States produces more gas in anyone.</v>

2483
01:12:59.451 --> 01:12:59.800
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

2484
01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:00.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2485
01:13:00.190 --> 01:13:00.780
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2486
01:13:00.780 --> 01:13:02.020
<v Speaker 3>That should change.</v>

2487
01:13:02.070 --> 01:13:03.310
<v Speaker 3>And I think that that's a,</v>

2488
01:13:03.580 --> 01:13:04.780
<v Speaker 3>it is a positive thing.</v>

2489
01:13:04.781 --> 01:13:04.991
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2490
01:13:04.991 --> 01:13:07.720
<v Speaker 3>whatever the controversies about fracking right now and you have to make</v>

2491
01:13:07.721 --> 01:13:08.830
<v Speaker 3>everything safer obviously.</v>

2492
01:13:09.220 --> 01:13:14.220
<v Speaker 3>But eventually anything that helps us get off foreign foreign oil because that's</v>

2493
01:13:14.771 --> 01:13:15.510
<v Speaker 3>what funds it.</v>

2494
01:13:15.510 --> 01:13:15.920
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2495
01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:16.700
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2496
01:13:16.700 --> 01:13:16.890
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2497
01:13:16.890 --> 01:13:21.890
<v Speaker 4>this is like abu dhabi and dubai in the areas that were just 50,</v>

2498
01:13:22.980 --> 01:13:24.020
<v Speaker 4>60 years ago,</v>

2499
01:13:24.350 --> 01:13:28.470
<v Speaker 4>baron mean there was nothing there and now they're thriving.</v>

2500
01:13:28.820 --> 01:13:32.470
<v Speaker 4>Huge citieS and the economy is just.</v>

2501
01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:35.030
<v Speaker 4>Just blossomed out of oil.</v>

2502
01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:35.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2503
01:13:35.910 --> 01:13:38.700
<v Speaker 3>it's oil and then tourism and things like that,</v>

2504
01:13:38.701 --> 01:13:40.620
<v Speaker 3>but it's not really innovation.</v>

2505
01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:44.640
<v Speaker 3>It's not like they're providing some sort of service or manufacturing and kind</v>

2506
01:13:44.641 --> 01:13:46.230
<v Speaker 3>of goods or they've got any,</v>

2507
01:13:46.350 --> 01:13:49.950
<v Speaker 3>any even cultural elements that are going around all over the world.</v>

2508
01:13:49.951 --> 01:13:50.400
<v Speaker 3>That is,</v>

2509
01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:50.511
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2510
01:13:50.511 --> 01:13:51.520
<v Speaker 3>how does it touch?</v>

2511
01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:53.600
<v Speaker 3>How does that change the woRld?</v>

2512
01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:55.440
<v Speaker 3>That's the reason for their success.</v>

2513
01:13:55.441 --> 01:13:56.210
<v Speaker 3>you said it yourself,</v>

2514
01:13:56.210 --> 01:14:00.120
<v Speaker 3>see oil change that and you change things drastically.</v>

2515
01:14:00.121 --> 01:14:01.990
<v Speaker 3>They're like they Are the.</v>

2516
01:14:02.310 --> 01:14:07.310
<v Speaker 3>The thing that would put an end to all of them is a if they ran out of oil or if</v>

2517
01:14:07.981 --> 01:14:08.990
<v Speaker 3>we didn't need their own.</v>

2518
01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:10.033
<v Speaker 4>Would that though?</v>

2519
01:14:10.060 --> 01:14:10.521
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2520
01:14:10.521 --> 01:14:11.900
<v Speaker 4>what would really is there.</v>

2521
01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:14.830
<v Speaker 1>it seems like there's so much momentum on their side.</v>

2522
01:14:14.831 --> 01:14:15.141
<v Speaker 1>I mean the.</v>

2523
01:14:15.141 --> 01:14:17.500
<v Speaker 1>The culture has been so firmly established.</v>

2524
01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:20.130
<v Speaker 1>Their mindset has been so firmly established.</v>

2525
01:14:20.131 --> 01:14:25.131
<v Speaker 1>This adherence to radical islamic philosophy and ideology is so firmly</v>

2526
01:14:26.220 --> 01:14:27.053
<v Speaker 1>established.</v>

2527
01:14:27.220 --> 01:14:28.690
<v Speaker 1>How does one ever change that?</v>

2528
01:14:30.110 --> 01:14:31.530
<v Speaker 3>You change it when you have to go,</v>

2529
01:14:31.820 --> 01:14:32.091
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

2530
01:14:32.091 --> 01:14:33.920
<v Speaker 3>like when you have to move on with life,</v>

2531
01:14:34.070 --> 01:14:35.480
<v Speaker 3>when you can't maintain that.</v>

2532
01:14:35.500 --> 01:14:39.050
<v Speaker 3>When you do like if the rest of the world is moving on and you are not able to</v>

2533
01:14:39.051 --> 01:14:42.350
<v Speaker 3>stay in that bubble when you need to have international trade relationships,</v>

2534
01:14:42.351 --> 01:14:42.710
<v Speaker 3>when you,</v>

2535
01:14:42.710 --> 01:14:47.030
<v Speaker 3>when you are dependent on a diplomatic relations with other countries and you</v>

2536
01:14:47.031 --> 01:14:49.040
<v Speaker 3>can't just get away wIth the shit that you do all the time,</v>

2537
01:14:49.460 --> 01:14:52.010
<v Speaker 3>then that's how countries evolve.</v>

2538
01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:52.940
<v Speaker 3>That's how they progress.</v>

2539
01:14:53.180 --> 01:14:57.440
<v Speaker 3>They haven't needed to do that yet because they're fine.</v>

2540
01:14:57.441 --> 01:14:58.161
<v Speaker 3>They're in their bubble,</v>

2541
01:14:58.161 --> 01:14:59.150
<v Speaker 3>they've got a lot of oil money.</v>

2542
01:14:59.630 --> 01:15:00.321
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's happy.</v>

2543
01:15:00.321 --> 01:15:01.131
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's well fed.</v>

2544
01:15:01.131 --> 01:15:02.550
<v Speaker 3>I mean if they're obscene,</v>

2545
01:15:02.551 --> 01:15:03.550
<v Speaker 3>lee rich like,</v>

2546
01:15:03.551 --> 01:15:03.641
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2547
01:15:03.641 --> 01:15:04.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2548
01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:04.953
<v Speaker 3>like trillium.</v>

2549
01:15:05.570 --> 01:15:07.640
<v Speaker 3>Oh they're fucking crazy rich.</v>

2550
01:15:07.900 --> 01:15:10.140
<v Speaker 3>I was there like the just going into reality.</v>

2551
01:15:10.150 --> 01:15:11.650
<v Speaker 3>You can't as a tourist you can go under the.</v>

2552
01:15:11.780 --> 01:15:12.613
<v Speaker 3>And this is,</v>

2553
01:15:13.070 --> 01:15:14.390
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about the mid nineties.</v>

2554
01:15:14.391 --> 01:15:14.721
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2555
01:15:14.721 --> 01:15:14.931
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2556
01:15:14.931 --> 01:15:15.764
<v Speaker 3>when you see those,</v>

2557
01:15:16.130 --> 01:15:19.520
<v Speaker 3>those movies with all the futuristic cities and stuff,</v>

2558
01:15:19.730 --> 01:15:20.563
<v Speaker 3>it was a.</v>

2559
01:15:20.930 --> 01:15:22.010
<v Speaker 3>It really looked like that.</v>

2560
01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:23.450
<v Speaker 3>The architecture of the buildings,</v>

2561
01:15:23.451 --> 01:15:24.060
<v Speaker 3>the highways,</v>

2562
01:15:24.060 --> 01:15:24.890
<v Speaker 3>and just,</v>

2563
01:15:24.890 --> 01:15:25.340
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2564
01:15:25.340 --> 01:15:26.850
<v Speaker 3>it's beautiful to see this.</v>

2565
01:15:26.851 --> 01:15:30.380
<v Speaker 3>It's the people that are walking around her all wearing burkas and</v>

2566
01:15:31.630 --> 01:15:35.200
<v Speaker 1>agent close with the most sophisticated modern city.</v>

2567
01:15:35.201 --> 01:15:36.550
<v Speaker 1>It's such a weird thing.</v>

2568
01:15:36.620 --> 01:15:36.870
<v Speaker 3>Knowledge.</v>

2569

<v Speaker 3>it gets it's contradiction.</v>

2570
01:15:39.540 --> 01:15:40.560
<v Speaker 3>It is really strange.</v>

2571
01:15:40.620 --> 01:15:41.071
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2572
01:15:41.071 --> 01:15:44.400
<v Speaker 3>and there's one royal family that's running it as a whole bunch of brothers and</v>

2573
01:15:44.650 --> 01:15:44.930
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2574
01:15:44.930 --> 01:15:45.691
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of like,</v>

2575
01:15:45.691 --> 01:15:46.460
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2576
01:15:46.460 --> 01:15:46.670
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2577
01:15:46.670 --> 01:15:47.503
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>

2578
01:15:47.650 --> 01:15:51.210
<v Speaker 3>the people who live there and come stay there for a little while and go away.</v>

2579
01:15:51.740 --> 01:15:52.660
<v Speaker 3>All the expatriates.</v>

2580
01:15:52.910 --> 01:15:53.743
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>

2581
01:15:54.490 --> 01:15:54.900
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

2582
01:15:54.900 --> 01:15:56.250
<v Speaker 3>it's like they're running a hotel.</v>

2583
01:15:56.310 --> 01:15:59.850
<v Speaker 3>It's like a family running a hotel and it's got all its money and sort of</v>

2584
01:16:00.390 --> 01:16:01.220
<v Speaker 3>american accounts.</v>

2585
01:16:01.220 --> 01:16:01.831
<v Speaker 3>Those accounts,</v>

2586
01:16:01.831 --> 01:16:02.041
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2587
01:16:02.041 --> 01:16:02.874
<v Speaker 3>wherever.</v>

2588
01:16:03.030 --> 01:16:03.863
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2589
01:16:04.350 --> 01:16:06.090
<v Speaker 3>people just check in and check out all the time.</v>

2590
01:16:07.560 --> 01:16:09.120
<v Speaker 3>You get paid according to your passport.</v>

2591
01:16:09.550 --> 01:16:10.300
<v Speaker 1>I met a dude,</v>

2592
01:16:10.300 --> 01:16:11.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say his name,</v>

2593
01:16:11.470 --> 01:16:16.000
<v Speaker 1>he's a prince in one of those places who listens to my podcast.</v>

2594
01:16:16.660 --> 01:16:18.870
<v Speaker 1>We had a long conversation about amazing.</v>

2595
01:16:18.990 --> 01:16:22.120
<v Speaker 1>Now you may be good as a young guy,</v>

2596
01:16:22.180 --> 01:16:22.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2597
01:16:22.730 --> 01:16:25.780
<v Speaker 1>it was weird talking to this young guy who's probably,</v>

2598
01:16:25.900 --> 01:16:26.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2599
01:16:26.380 --> 01:16:27.730
<v Speaker 1>we didn't discuss his finances,</v>

2600
01:16:27.731 --> 01:16:29.740
<v Speaker 1>but I'm assuming he's insanely wealthy,</v>

2601
01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:31.051
<v Speaker 1>but he just wanted it.</v>

2602
01:16:31.051 --> 01:16:33.100
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to sit down with me and talk about the ufc.</v>

2603
01:16:33.430 --> 01:16:34.300
<v Speaker 1>He's a big fan.</v>

2604
01:16:34.530 --> 01:16:34.820
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah.</v>

2605
01:16:34.820 --> 01:16:35.200
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

2606
01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:37.750
<v Speaker 1>At this weird conversation about,</v>

2607
01:16:37.810 --> 01:16:38.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2608
01:16:38.170 --> 01:16:42.610
<v Speaker 1>strategies and tactics in fighters and the trends and where things are moving</v>

2609
01:16:42.611 --> 01:16:43.271
<v Speaker 1>and changing.</v>

2610
01:16:43.271 --> 01:16:43.661
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

2611
01:16:43.661 --> 01:16:44.494
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking to,</v>

2612
01:16:44.790 --> 01:16:45.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2613
01:16:45.300 --> 01:16:50.300
<v Speaker 1>a guy who could one day be the head of one of these gigantic governments.</v>

2614
01:16:52.090 --> 01:16:52.750
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

2615
01:16:52.750 --> 01:16:53.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2616
01:16:53.290 --> 01:16:54.550
<v Speaker 1>I guess you'd call it a government.</v>

2617
01:16:54.580 --> 01:16:56.050
<v Speaker 1>It's not really monarchy.</v>

2618
01:16:56.110 --> 01:16:57.940
<v Speaker 1>Would you call it the monarchy to kinda.</v>

2619
01:16:58.030 --> 01:17:00.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a kind of government,</v>

2620
01:17:01.300 --> 01:17:03.010
<v Speaker 1>but it was very strange,</v>

2621
01:17:03.670 --> 01:17:05.260
<v Speaker 1>very strange to have this conversation,</v>

2622
01:17:05.530 --> 01:17:06.320
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2623
01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:06.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2624
01:17:06.850 --> 01:17:08.500
<v Speaker 3>It's a really different world.</v>

2625
01:17:08.530 --> 01:17:09.860
<v Speaker 3>It's like another planet.</v>

2626
01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:11.280
<v Speaker 4>And to be fair,</v>

2627
01:17:11.281 --> 01:17:13.320
<v Speaker 4>his was a less suppressive.</v>

2628
01:17:13.321 --> 01:17:16.380
<v Speaker 4>We're not talking about like Saudi Arabia beheading people over sorcery.</v>

2629
01:17:16.410 --> 01:17:17.610
<v Speaker 4>It's not that,</v>

2630
01:17:17.611 --> 01:17:18.444
<v Speaker 4>but</v>

2631
01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:19.831
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2632
01:17:19.831 --> 01:17:21.150
<v Speaker 4>that part of the world is,</v>

2633
01:17:21.180 --> 01:17:21.830
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2634
01:17:21.830 --> 01:17:22.680
<v Speaker 4>it is,</v>

2635
01:17:22.681 --> 01:17:23.010
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

2636
01:17:23.010 --> 01:17:24.810
<v Speaker 4>it's almost impossible,</v>

2637
01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:29.670
<v Speaker 4>I think for a lot of people who are apologists for that part of the world to</v>

2638
01:17:29.730 --> 01:17:32.100
<v Speaker 4>rationalize it or to understand that the way you do,</v>

2639
01:17:32.100 --> 01:17:32.933
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2640
01:17:33.190 --> 01:17:34.023
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2641
01:17:34.150 --> 01:17:34.590
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

2642
01:17:34.590 --> 01:17:38.600
<v Speaker 3>it's really unbelievable and I understand that now when,</v>

2643
01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:39.670
<v Speaker 3>when I was there,</v>

2644
01:17:40.310 --> 01:17:44.830
<v Speaker 3>I'm just explaining the way that things happen there.</v>

2645
01:17:44.831 --> 01:17:45.560
<v Speaker 3>Two people over here,</v>

2646
01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:50.470
<v Speaker 3>it's just so removed and so alien that people either shut it out of their mind</v>

2647
01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:51.490
<v Speaker 3>or they don't believe it</v>

2648
01:17:52.990 --> 01:17:54.730
<v Speaker 3>because I've seen that a lot.</v>

2649
01:17:54.880 --> 01:17:55.310
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2650
01:17:55.310 --> 01:17:55.920
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2651
01:17:55.920 --> 01:17:56.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2652
01:17:56.110 --> 01:17:58.220
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you stories of what I'm doing in my book as,</v>

2653
01:17:58.221 --> 01:17:58.391
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2654
01:17:58.391 --> 01:17:59.350
<v Speaker 3>when I talk about these things,</v>

2655
01:17:59.351 --> 01:18:04.351
<v Speaker 3>I was trying to bring personal anecdotes into it before I go into the topic in</v>

2656
01:18:04.721 --> 01:18:07.030
<v Speaker 3>detail because it helps.</v>

2657
01:18:07.260 --> 01:18:08.093
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2658
01:18:08.860 --> 01:18:10.220
<v Speaker 3>it helps people to relate to it.</v>

2659
01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:13.510
<v Speaker 3>So this is something that happened when I was in fifth grade.</v>

2660
01:18:13.511 --> 01:18:14.830
<v Speaker 3>So I went to the american school there,</v>

2661
01:18:14.860 --> 01:18:16.360
<v Speaker 3>which is kind of why I talk like this.</v>

2662
01:18:17.770 --> 01:18:18.730
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2663
01:18:19.180 --> 01:18:19.931
<v Speaker 3>when I was in fifth grade,</v>

2664
01:18:19.931 --> 01:18:21.940
<v Speaker 3>we made snowflakes during the winter.</v>

2665
01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:23.033
<v Speaker 3>I got a paper,</v>

2666
01:18:23.650 --> 01:18:26.530
<v Speaker 3>fold up a piece of paper and you cut it and make some things and we decorated</v>

2667
01:18:26.531 --> 01:18:30.010
<v Speaker 3>them with glue and glitter and our names and so on.</v>

2668
01:18:30.011 --> 01:18:32.090
<v Speaker 3>And the teacher put them up on the,</v>

2669
01:18:32.410 --> 01:18:33.243
<v Speaker 3>on the door,</v>

2670
01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:34.090
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2671
01:18:34.090 --> 01:18:35.830
<v Speaker 3>Or the bulletin board and I can't remember exactly.</v>

2672
01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:38.290
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

2673
01:18:39.610 --> 01:18:41.770
<v Speaker 3>you take a lot of pride in that kind of stuff when you're a kid.</v>

2674
01:18:41.990 --> 01:18:46.210
<v Speaker 3>I was like 10 or 11 years old and there a ministry of education guy who used to</v>

2675
01:18:46.211 --> 01:18:49.330
<v Speaker 3>come in and use to check the school to make sure everything is operating</v>

2676
01:18:49.331 --> 01:18:49.940
<v Speaker 3>correctly,</v>

2677
01:18:49.940 --> 01:18:50.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2678
01:18:50.110 --> 01:18:50.410
<v Speaker 3>like you,</v>

2679
01:18:50.410 --> 01:18:51.610
<v Speaker 3>you have to say winter holidays,</v>

2680
01:18:51.611 --> 01:18:53.110
<v Speaker 3>you can speak about christmas.</v>

2681
01:18:53.111 --> 01:18:55.660
<v Speaker 3>You couldn't have read during valentine's and so on.</v>

2682
01:18:55.870 --> 01:18:57.100
<v Speaker 3>So they,</v>

2683
01:18:57.101 --> 01:18:57.340
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2684
01:18:57.340 --> 01:19:01.810
<v Speaker 3>he saw the snowflakes and he started yelling at the teacher and arabic teacher</v>

2685
01:19:01.811 --> 01:19:06.811
<v Speaker 3>didn't even know arabic and in front of all the kids and he Just took a pair of</v>

2686
01:19:06.881 --> 01:19:09.790
<v Speaker 3>scissors and he cut one of the tips off of each of the snoWflakes.</v>

2687
01:19:10.790 --> 01:19:11.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2688
01:19:11.290 --> 01:19:11.591
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2689
01:19:11.591 --> 01:19:12.280
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2690
01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:12.941
<v Speaker 3>so I remember thinking,</v>

2691
01:19:12.941 --> 01:19:13.181
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2692
01:19:13.181 --> 01:19:13.531
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

2693
01:19:13.531 --> 01:19:14.590
<v Speaker 3>it worked really hard on that.</v>

2694
01:19:14.591 --> 01:19:15.720
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

2695
01:19:15.850 --> 01:19:19.690
<v Speaker 3>he just like amputated one of the tIps of the snowflakes and then we asked the</v>

2696
01:19:19.691 --> 01:19:22.030
<v Speaker 3>teacher what happened and we wanted to know.</v>

2697
01:19:22.180 --> 01:19:23.013
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

2698
01:19:23.230 --> 01:19:24.910
<v Speaker 3>that's when I found out about the star of david.</v>

2699
01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:28.390
<v Speaker 3>So david has six points,</v>

2700
01:19:29.140 --> 01:19:32.530
<v Speaker 3>so anything that has like six points is a apparently band there.</v>

2701
01:19:33.520 --> 01:19:35.680
<v Speaker 3>So she told us about the star of david.</v>

2702
01:19:35.980 --> 01:19:37.690
<v Speaker 3>She said it's a sign of the jews.</v>

2703
01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:39.670
<v Speaker 3>So this was my introduction to the jews.</v>

2704
01:19:39.671 --> 01:19:41.260
<v Speaker 3>I didn't really know anything about the jews before,</v>

2705
01:19:41.890 --> 01:19:42.760
<v Speaker 3>but I just thought it was like,</v>

2706
01:19:42.761 --> 01:19:43.121
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

2707
01:19:43.121 --> 01:19:43.870
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

2708
01:19:43.870 --> 01:19:44.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2709
01:19:44.650 --> 01:19:45.940
<v Speaker 3>these must be scary people,</v>

2710
01:19:45.970 --> 01:19:46.803
<v Speaker 3>whoever they are,</v>

2711
01:19:48.740 --> 01:19:53.070
<v Speaker 3>the guys cutting tips off as catholics fucking snowflakes criticized.</v>

2712
01:19:53.680 --> 01:19:54.960
<v Speaker 3>So I went back and uh,</v>

2713
01:19:55.240 --> 01:19:55.481
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2714
01:19:55.481 --> 01:19:57.160
<v Speaker 3>I asked my dad about it.</v>

2715
01:19:57.460 --> 01:19:59.290
<v Speaker 3>My dad was adopted as a professor,</v>

2716
01:19:59.291 --> 01:20:01.270
<v Speaker 3>so it was fairly fairly rational guy.</v>

2717
01:20:01.930 --> 01:20:04.870
<v Speaker 3>And then he told me about the whole Israel palestinian history,</v>

2718
01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:06.970
<v Speaker 3>explained it to me as well as I could understand it.</v>

2719
01:20:07.020 --> 01:20:08.100
<v Speaker 3>And then he pulled out a map.</v>

2720
01:20:08.101 --> 01:20:08.611
<v Speaker 3>It was one of those,</v>

2721
01:20:08.611 --> 01:20:08.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2722
01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:09.930
<v Speaker 3>inflatable globes,</v>

2723
01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:11.473
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2724
01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:15.030
<v Speaker 3>and you tried to show me Israel on the map and it wasn't there like,</v>

2725
01:20:15.031 --> 01:20:15.301
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

2726
01:20:15.301 --> 01:20:15.991
<v Speaker 3>this map was,</v>

2727
01:20:15.991 --> 01:20:16.824
<v Speaker 3>we bought it in the,</v>

2728
01:20:16.860 --> 01:20:18.450
<v Speaker 3>in a bookstore in riyadh,</v>

2729
01:20:19.230 --> 01:20:20.730
<v Speaker 3>and there's no Israel,</v>

2730
01:20:20.790 --> 01:20:21.601
<v Speaker 3>there was no Israel.</v>

2731
01:20:21.601 --> 01:20:22.410
<v Speaker 3>It was like a,</v>

2732
01:20:22.410 --> 01:20:24.920
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't even like they labeled it something else.</v>

2733
01:20:24.921 --> 01:20:26.070
<v Speaker 3>So they made it all palestine.</v>

2734
01:20:26.071 --> 01:20:27.270
<v Speaker 3>Like I remember this distinctly.</v>

2735
01:20:27.271 --> 01:20:28.051
<v Speaker 3>There was a border,</v>

2736
01:20:28.051 --> 01:20:30.800
<v Speaker 3>they'd drawn the border and the rest of it was the same color as the</v>

2737
01:20:30.801 --> 01:20:34.860
<v Speaker 3>mediterranean and same color as the car was as a c,</v>

2738
01:20:34.861 --> 01:20:36.180
<v Speaker 3>so it was just like a little notch.</v>

2739
01:20:36.660 --> 01:20:37.493
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2740
01:20:37.780 --> 01:20:39.180
<v Speaker 3>so it was,</v>

2741
01:20:39.420 --> 01:20:41.760
<v Speaker 3>I remember we bought the world book encyclopedia,</v>

2742
01:20:42.440 --> 01:20:42.811
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2743
01:20:42.811 --> 01:20:43.644
<v Speaker 3>around that time,</v>

2744
01:20:44.080 --> 01:20:44.370
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2745
01:20:44.370 --> 01:20:45.270
<v Speaker 3>that was a big thing.</v>

2746
01:20:45.271 --> 01:20:46.710
<v Speaker 3>Encyclopedias are obsolete now.</v>

2747
01:20:46.770 --> 01:20:47.250
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

2748
01:20:47.250 --> 01:20:48.570
<v Speaker 3>and they'd taken out the,</v>

2749
01:20:48.571 --> 01:20:49.404
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2750
01:20:49.590 --> 01:20:51.810
<v Speaker 3>the entrIes on Israel and evolution and everything,</v>

2751
01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:52.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2752
01:20:52.440 --> 01:20:55.170
<v Speaker 3>you pay a lot of money for it and they took it out so they,</v>

2753
01:20:55.770 --> 01:20:56.760
<v Speaker 3>they'll do those things.</v>

2754
01:20:56.790 --> 01:20:57.001
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

2755
01:20:57.001 --> 01:20:58.110
<v Speaker 3>what I'm saying is,</v>

2756
01:20:58.840 --> 01:20:59.220
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2757
01:20:59.220 --> 01:20:59.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2758
01:20:59.570 --> 01:21:00.340
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2759
01:21:00.340 --> 01:21:00.600
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2760
01:21:00.600 --> 01:21:01.770
<v Speaker 3>this was my introduction.</v>

2761
01:21:01.771 --> 01:21:02.840
<v Speaker 3>This is what I saw in my.</v>

2762
01:21:02.850 --> 01:21:03.271
<v Speaker 3>Fortunately,</v>

2763
01:21:03.271 --> 01:21:05.580
<v Speaker 3>my father was rational and you know,</v>

2764
01:21:05.581 --> 01:21:07.440
<v Speaker 3>he told me the right story,</v>

2765
01:21:07.441 --> 01:21:10.170
<v Speaker 3>but there were a lot of other kids that also went home.</v>

2766
01:21:10.171 --> 01:21:11.940
<v Speaker 3>They ask their parents the same questions,</v>

2767
01:21:12.310 --> 01:21:12.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2768
01:21:12.660 --> 01:21:17.190
<v Speaker 3>what is the star of david or the jews and I don't know what kind of responses</v>

2769
01:21:17.191 --> 01:21:18.024
<v Speaker 3>they got.</v>

2770
01:21:18.300 --> 01:21:19.290
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what they were told.</v>

2771
01:21:20.070 --> 01:21:21.600
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>

2772
01:21:21.630 --> 01:21:22.463
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2773
01:21:22.770 --> 01:21:23.130
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2774
01:21:23.130 --> 01:21:24.870
<v Speaker 3>you live with that in school,</v>

2775
01:21:24.900 --> 01:21:27.990
<v Speaker 3>you live with that as a kid who's even if you're a foreigner,</v>

2776
01:21:28.380 --> 01:21:30.090
<v Speaker 3>even if you're going to an american school,</v>

2777
01:21:30.570 --> 01:21:30.841
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2778
01:21:30.841 --> 01:21:35.670
<v Speaker 3>you have these ideas around you and the kids who were in the saudi schools,</v>

2779
01:21:35.671 --> 01:21:39.000
<v Speaker 3>which are separate on the way that foreigners are not allowed to go to saudi</v>

2780
01:21:39.001 --> 01:21:39.834
<v Speaker 3>schools.</v>

2781
01:21:40.060 --> 01:21:40.950
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2782
01:21:41.320 --> 01:21:44.280
<v Speaker 3>their textbooks are just insane.</v>

2783
01:21:44.610 --> 01:21:46.440
<v Speaker 3>The kind of stuff they have about jews,</v>

2784
01:21:46.441 --> 01:21:48.090
<v Speaker 3>about infidels and you know,</v>

2785
01:21:48.180 --> 01:21:49.013
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

2786
01:21:49.080 --> 01:21:49.380
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

2787
01:21:49.380 --> 01:21:51.990
<v Speaker 3>they actually teach this stuff to kids.</v>

2788
01:21:52.650 --> 01:21:52.861
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2789
01:21:52.861 --> 01:21:57.570
<v Speaker 3>in the uk recently there was a saudi school that was in the uk and they were</v>

2790
01:21:57.571 --> 01:22:00.550
<v Speaker 3>using some of these textbooks and there was a big brouhaha about it.</v>

2791
01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:01.980
<v Speaker 3>A brouhaha.</v>

2792
01:22:02.630 --> 01:22:02.790
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2793
01:22:02.790 --> 01:22:03.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2794
01:22:03.330 --> 01:22:04.470
<v Speaker 3>they love the term.</v>

2795
01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:06.433
<v Speaker 3>Sorry,</v>

2796
01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:07.330
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

2797
01:22:07.330 --> 01:22:11.720
<v Speaker 3>I was wanting to say that I ever fucking say brouhaha</v>

2798
01:22:12.850 --> 01:22:13.361
<v Speaker 4>credible,</v>

2799
01:22:13.361 --> 01:22:15.520
<v Speaker 4>that they have to cut your snowflake.</v>

2800
01:22:16.210 --> 01:22:18.880
<v Speaker 4>Your snowflake was symbolic of these evil wizard.</v>

2801
01:22:18.881 --> 01:22:20.980
<v Speaker 4>Jews didn't their sorcery.</v>

2802
01:22:21.480 --> 01:22:22.720
<v Speaker 3>Nobody would have made that connection.</v>

2803
01:22:23.130 --> 01:22:24.060
<v Speaker 3>But that's what I mean.</v>

2804
01:22:24.061 --> 01:22:28.740
<v Speaker 3>It's stuff that's so unimaginable and things that you wouldn't even think of.</v>

2805
01:22:29.650 --> 01:22:34.650
<v Speaker 4>I watched a documentary once on the suicide bombers and uh,</v>

2806
01:22:35.650 --> 01:22:38.110
<v Speaker 4>there was a school that they were running,</v>

2807
01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:38.920
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2808
01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:43.920
<v Speaker 4>where they had these images in this children's school of these kids that had</v>

2809
01:22:44.561 --> 01:22:49.561
<v Speaker 4>blown themselves up in images of them in these holy images of them covered with</v>

2810
01:22:49.601 --> 01:22:50.070
<v Speaker 4>their,</v>

2811
01:22:50.070 --> 01:22:52.240
<v Speaker 4>their explosive vests.</v>

2812
01:22:52.241 --> 01:22:53.500
<v Speaker 4>and they were,</v>

2813
01:22:54.040 --> 01:22:57.190
<v Speaker 4>they had a saying on the wall above them that said,</v>

2814
01:22:57.880 --> 01:23:01.660
<v Speaker 4>the children of today or tomorrow's holy martyrs.</v>

2815
01:23:03.100 --> 01:23:05.740
<v Speaker 4>And there's just like trying to,</v>

2816
01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:11.280
<v Speaker 4>trying to wrap your mind around the idea that you are,</v>

2817
01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:16.440
<v Speaker 4>you're promoting that you were going to raise these children to be holy martyrs.</v>

2818
01:23:17.111 --> 01:23:21.610
<v Speaker 4>Meaning they are going to blow themselves up and kill a bunch of bad people with</v>

2819
01:23:21.611 --> 01:23:23.530
<v Speaker 4>them and this is going to be a great thing.</v>

2820
01:23:23.680 --> 01:23:27.400
<v Speaker 4>And then their images are going to be displayed at this school and everyone's</v>

2821
01:23:27.401 --> 01:23:30.870
<v Speaker 4>going to praise them and it's,</v>

2822
01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:32.530
<v Speaker 4>it's impossible.</v>

2823
01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:33.710
<v Speaker 4>It didn't make any sense.</v>

2824
01:23:33.730 --> 01:23:34.300
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>

2825
01:23:34.300 --> 01:23:34.880
<v Speaker 4>it didn't,</v>

2826
01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:35.900
<v Speaker 4>it didn't fit it.</v>

2827
01:23:36.010 --> 01:23:37.810
<v Speaker 4>I tried to find a place for it in my head.</v>

2828
01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:39.370
<v Speaker 4>I tried to shove it in there somewhere.</v>

2829
01:23:39.371 --> 01:23:39.601
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

2830
01:23:39.601 --> 01:23:40.580
<v Speaker 4>this has got to be fake.</v>

2831
01:23:40.581 --> 01:23:41.414
<v Speaker 4>You can't be real.</v>

2832
01:23:41.490 --> 01:23:41.611
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2833
01:23:41.611 --> 01:23:41.741
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

2834
01:23:41.741 --> 01:23:46.741
<v Speaker 3>It's a tough thing that I'm realizing more and more as I live here with every</v>

2835
01:23:46.981 --> 01:23:50.160
<v Speaker 3>passing year that people who have been raised here so very difficult for them to</v>

2836
01:23:50.161 --> 01:23:53.060
<v Speaker 3>comprehend that mindset because we grew up like,</v>

2837
01:23:53.061 --> 01:23:54.480
<v Speaker 3>I grew up in a shia muslim family.</v>

2838
01:23:54.810 --> 01:23:55.643
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2839
01:23:55.650 --> 01:23:56.350
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2840
01:23:56.350 --> 01:23:57.970
<v Speaker 4>can you explain the difference for folks who don't know?</v>

2841
01:23:57.971 --> 01:23:58.804
<v Speaker 4>What is the difference?</v>

2842
01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:03.420
<v Speaker 3>There are basically two different schools of thought.</v>

2843
01:24:03.421 --> 01:24:04.110
<v Speaker 3>So after,</v>

2844
01:24:04.110 --> 01:24:04.681
<v Speaker 3>after,</v>

2845
01:24:04.681 --> 01:24:05.130
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2846
01:24:05.130 --> 01:24:06.720
<v Speaker 3>the prophet mohammed died,</v>

2847
01:24:07.020 --> 01:24:07.853
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2848
01:24:08.330 --> 01:24:09.420
<v Speaker 3>you had his,</v>

2849
01:24:09.440 --> 01:24:10.273
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2850
01:24:10.920 --> 01:24:11.581
<v Speaker 3>his best friend,</v>

2851
01:24:11.581 --> 01:24:12.420
<v Speaker 3>his name is albuquerque,</v>

2852
01:24:12.860 --> 01:24:13.140
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2853
01:24:13.140 --> 01:24:13.611
<v Speaker 3>And we're just,</v>

2854
01:24:13.611 --> 01:24:15.600
<v Speaker 3>what the current isis caliphate is named after.</v>

2855
01:24:16.020 --> 01:24:16.591
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2856
01:24:16.591 --> 01:24:21.210
<v Speaker 3>you had his son in law and his cousin and his name is ali.</v>

2857
01:24:21.930 --> 01:24:23.580
<v Speaker 3>So I name I'm named after,</v>

2858
01:24:24.110 --> 01:24:24.690
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2859
01:24:24.690 --> 01:24:26.940
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how that ended up like,</v>

2860
01:24:27.030 --> 01:24:27.781
<v Speaker 3>what we're named after,</v>

2861
01:24:27.781 --> 01:24:28.380
<v Speaker 3>but anyway,</v>

2862
01:24:28.380 --> 01:24:32.670
<v Speaker 3>so what happens is he had these two different lines and there was a,</v>

2863
01:24:32.671 --> 01:24:33.960
<v Speaker 3>there was a conflict about,</v>

2864
01:24:34.040 --> 01:24:34.571
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2865
01:24:34.571 --> 01:24:34.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2866
01:24:34.930 --> 01:24:35.763
<v Speaker 3>people were,</v>

2867
01:24:36.690 --> 01:24:38.460
<v Speaker 3>they couldn't decide who the successor was going to be.</v>

2868
01:24:38.461 --> 01:24:42.450
<v Speaker 3>Some people kind of flock to the califit which was elbow bucker and the other</v>

2869
01:24:42.451 --> 01:24:44.640
<v Speaker 3>caliphs and others flocked to the moms,</v>

2870
01:24:45.180 --> 01:24:46.650
<v Speaker 3>which was a alley.</v>

2871
01:24:46.651 --> 01:24:47.700
<v Speaker 3>So it was his successor.</v>

2872
01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:51.510
<v Speaker 3>It was just basically you had conflict about who the successor was going to be</v>

2873
01:24:51.511 --> 01:24:53.550
<v Speaker 3>in different people took different sites.</v>

2874
01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:56.010
<v Speaker 3>That's the long story short.</v>

2875
01:24:56.130 --> 01:25:01.130
<v Speaker 4>Well that became Incredibly confusing to americans when the Iraq war went on and</v>

2876
01:25:02.851 --> 01:25:03.840
<v Speaker 4>we realized that,</v>

2877
01:25:03.900 --> 01:25:04.081
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2878
01:25:04.081 --> 01:25:04.321
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2879
01:25:04.321 --> 01:25:08.340
<v Speaker 4>there's a war going on now that we've killed saddam hussein between the sunni</v>

2880
01:25:08.460 --> 01:25:09.293
<v Speaker 4>and the shia.</v>

2881
01:25:09.660 --> 01:25:09.991
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2882
01:25:09.991 --> 01:25:10.680
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

2883
01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:11.513
<v Speaker 4>wait a minute.</v>

2884
01:25:11.610 --> 01:25:13.980
<v Speaker 4>The muslims don't like each other.</v>

2885
01:25:14.220 --> 01:25:15.750
<v Speaker 4>Like what kind of crazy shit is this</v>

2886
01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:18.840
<v Speaker 3>that they've been fighting and it's not just as soon he is and she has as a</v>

2887
01:25:18.841 --> 01:25:19.900
<v Speaker 3>whole bunch of other factions.</v>

2888
01:25:20.020 --> 01:25:20.940
<v Speaker 3>One of the major ones.</v>

2889
01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:21.720
<v Speaker 3>What are the other ones?</v>

2890
01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:21.931
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2891
01:25:21.931 --> 01:25:25.290
<v Speaker 3>there's too many names as I can know for talking about all the different</v>

2892
01:25:25.370 --> 01:25:26.260
<v Speaker 3>branches off a couple.</v>

2893
01:25:26.730 --> 01:25:28.810
<v Speaker 3>So there's aliens lutheran,</v>

2894
01:25:29.940 --> 01:25:30.451
<v Speaker 3>so yeah,</v>

2895
01:25:30.451 --> 01:25:31.290
<v Speaker 3>there's a sydney's in the,</v>

2896
01:25:31.450 --> 01:25:34.920
<v Speaker 3>as their primary within the sheet as you've got two different groups.</v>

2897
01:25:34.921 --> 01:25:35.930
<v Speaker 3>There's the [inaudible],</v>

2898
01:25:36.140 --> 01:25:38.550
<v Speaker 3>which is the 12 version they believe in 12 and moms.</v>

2899
01:25:38.910 --> 01:25:43.910
<v Speaker 3>And then there's another group that split off after the sixth and mom into a</v>

2900
01:25:43.921 --> 01:25:44.520
<v Speaker 3>separate,</v>

2901
01:25:44.520 --> 01:25:45.780
<v Speaker 3>sort of like descendency.</v>

2902
01:25:46.140 --> 01:25:47.150
<v Speaker 3>And those are the,</v>

2903
01:25:47.170 --> 01:25:47.430
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2904
01:25:47.430 --> 01:25:51.010
<v Speaker 3>they're called the smileys in sydney's,</v>

2905
01:25:51.030 --> 01:25:52.780
<v Speaker 3>you've got a salafi sydney's,</v>

2906
01:25:52.830 --> 01:25:53.840
<v Speaker 3>which is a lot of the,</v>

2907
01:25:54.910 --> 01:25:56.040
<v Speaker 3>the ones in Saudi Arabia.</v>

2908
01:25:56.041 --> 01:25:56.874
<v Speaker 3>we're very conservative.</v>

2909
01:25:56.890 --> 01:25:59.870
<v Speaker 3>You have four major schools of thought within the sneezers,</v>

2910
01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:01.200
<v Speaker 3>the uh,</v>

2911
01:26:01.470 --> 01:26:02.100
<v Speaker 3>you want the names.</v>

2912
01:26:02.100 --> 01:26:05.570
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's like a humbling shafi malarkey and how to fee.</v>

2913
01:26:05.930 --> 01:26:07.700
<v Speaker 3>So these are four different schools of thought.</v>

2914
01:26:07.701 --> 01:26:08.810
<v Speaker 3>They practice different things.</v>

2915
01:26:08.811 --> 01:26:09.411
<v Speaker 3>Like for instance,</v>

2916
01:26:09.411 --> 01:26:12.830
<v Speaker 3>the shafi sect does for them,</v>

2917
01:26:13.010 --> 01:26:16.640
<v Speaker 3>female genital mutilation is mandatory.</v>

2918
01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:18.740
<v Speaker 3>Mandatory mandatory.</v>

2919
01:26:18.741 --> 01:26:21.860
<v Speaker 3>So in Indonesia and in a lot of southeast,</v>

2920
01:26:21.890 --> 01:26:23.240
<v Speaker 3>southeast asian countries,</v>

2921
01:26:23.620 --> 01:26:24.261
<v Speaker 3>Indonesia,</v>

2922
01:26:24.261 --> 01:26:26.960
<v Speaker 3>where reza aslan says that women are 100 percent equal to men.</v>

2923
01:26:27.350 --> 01:26:27.801
<v Speaker 3>I would say.</v>

2924
01:26:27.801 --> 01:26:28.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2925
01:26:28.100 --> 01:26:29.360
<v Speaker 3>When it comes to circumcision rates,</v>

2926
01:26:29.370 --> 01:26:33.800
<v Speaker 3>they are more than 80 percent of men and women there are circumcised.</v>

2927
01:26:34.070 --> 01:26:38.330
<v Speaker 3>So circumcision for a man that was not nearly as brutal as circumcision for a</v>

2928
01:26:38.350 --> 01:26:39.030
<v Speaker 3>female,</v>

2929
01:26:39.030 --> 01:26:40.460
<v Speaker 3>it is just cutting off skin.</v>

2930
01:26:40.461 --> 01:26:41.990
<v Speaker 3>You're not cutting off the tourists.</v>

2931
01:26:42.110 --> 01:26:47.110
<v Speaker 3>There's four different kinds of fgm according to the who,</v>

2932
01:26:47.540 --> 01:26:52.520
<v Speaker 3>so that ranges from just nicking the clitoris to all the way to removing the</v>

2933
01:26:52.550 --> 01:26:53.630
<v Speaker 3>clitoris and the labia.</v>

2934
01:26:53.720 --> 01:26:57.130
<v Speaker 3>So making it as just sort of a scarring ritual.</v>

2935
01:26:57.130 --> 01:26:57.351
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2936
01:26:57.351 --> 01:26:57.601
<v Speaker 3>Nick,</v>

2937
01:26:57.601 --> 01:26:58.434
<v Speaker 3>a circle.</v>

2938
01:26:58.580 --> 01:27:02.270
<v Speaker 3>It's still pretty fucked up and they're all banned over here.</v>

2939
01:27:02.271 --> 01:27:02.931
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>

2940
01:27:02.931 --> 01:27:04.130
<v Speaker 3>there's different grades to it.</v>

2941
01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:05.953
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2942
01:27:06.290 --> 01:27:07.123
<v Speaker 3>but in.</v>

2943
01:27:07.340 --> 01:27:09.050
<v Speaker 3>So that's one example,</v>

2944
01:27:09.260 --> 01:27:09.561
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2945
01:27:09.561 --> 01:27:10.780
<v Speaker 3>Of the sect.</v>

2946
01:27:10.860 --> 01:27:13.370
<v Speaker 3>And then the molecules have a different belief than hunter fees have different</v>

2947
01:27:13.371 --> 01:27:14.060
<v Speaker 3>beliefs.</v>

2948
01:27:14.060 --> 01:27:14.540
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2949
01:27:14.540 --> 01:27:19.220
<v Speaker 3>and they'd range and they know there's really liberal ones within each sector is</v>

2950
01:27:19.221 --> 01:27:20.390
<v Speaker 3>really conservative ones.</v>

2951
01:27:20.870 --> 01:27:22.730
<v Speaker 3>So it's very wide.</v>

2952
01:27:22.760 --> 01:27:23.420
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2953
01:27:23.420 --> 01:27:23.681
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2954
01:27:23.681 --> 01:27:27.050
<v Speaker 3>you have jihadists who will actually go out and they'll carry out these</v>

2955
01:27:27.051 --> 01:27:28.410
<v Speaker 3>martyrdom operations.</v>

2956
01:27:28.411 --> 01:27:29.244
<v Speaker 3>Then you have,</v>

2957
01:27:29.330 --> 01:27:29.750
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2958
01:27:29.750 --> 01:27:33.230
<v Speaker 3>islamists who agree with political islam,</v>

2959
01:27:33.380 --> 01:27:36.590
<v Speaker 3>but not all of them are necessarily going to carry out these operations.</v>

2960
01:27:37.230 --> 01:27:41.240
<v Speaker 3>And then you have a moderate muslims and a lot of moderate muslims are extremely</v>

2961
01:27:41.241 --> 01:27:44.360
<v Speaker 3>conservative and they do believe in all those like conservative things like,</v>

2962
01:27:44.361 --> 01:27:44.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2963
01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:46.370
<v Speaker 3>being gay is not a good thing.</v>

2964
01:27:46.371 --> 01:27:47.330
<v Speaker 3>Women should cover herself,</v>

2965
01:27:47.750 --> 01:27:49.160
<v Speaker 3>so a lot of moderates will believe this,</v>

2966
01:27:49.161 --> 01:27:49.910
<v Speaker 3>but they're,</v>

2967
01:27:49.910 --> 01:27:54.910
<v Speaker 3>they reject the political ideology of islam and then you have a liberal and</v>

2968
01:27:55.041 --> 01:27:57.080
<v Speaker 3>progressive moderates and there are different as well.</v>

2969
01:27:57.080 --> 01:27:58.160
<v Speaker 3>So it's a very,</v>

2970
01:27:58.161 --> 01:27:58.401
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2971
01:27:58.401 --> 01:27:59.870
<v Speaker 3>it's a one point 6 billion people,</v>

2972
01:28:00.490 --> 01:28:01.940
<v Speaker 3>so it's a very wide,</v>

2973
01:28:02.450 --> 01:28:03.320
<v Speaker 3>it's extremely,</v>

2974
01:28:03.321 --> 01:28:04.250
<v Speaker 3>extremely diverse.</v>

2975
01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:05.833
<v Speaker 3>What is,</v>

2976
01:28:06.020 --> 01:28:09.220
<v Speaker 3>which is the more conservative of faction,</v>

2977
01:28:09.290 --> 01:28:09.860
<v Speaker 3>the sunni,</v>

2978
01:28:09.860 --> 01:28:10.880
<v Speaker 3>sunni or shia,</v>

2979
01:28:11.300 --> 01:28:12.133
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2980
01:28:12.510 --> 01:28:14.360
<v Speaker 3>this conservative elements in both.</v>

2981
01:28:14.540 --> 01:28:14.780
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2982
01:28:14.780 --> 01:28:18.500
<v Speaker 3>just to give you an example that may be more recognizable to you is,</v>

2983
01:28:18.710 --> 01:28:19.543
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2984
01:28:19.620 --> 01:28:21.290
<v Speaker 3>the iranian theocracy.</v>

2985
01:28:21.291 --> 01:28:23.420
<v Speaker 3>If you can keep that closer to like,</v>

2986
01:28:23.820 --> 01:28:25.520
<v Speaker 3>we don't want to vary too much from the sound.</v>

2987
01:28:25.521 --> 01:28:25.970
<v Speaker 3>You can just.</v>

2988
01:28:25.970 --> 01:28:26.220
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2989
01:28:26.220 --> 01:28:26.841
<v Speaker 3>hold it towards you.</v>

2990
01:28:26.841 --> 01:28:27.680
<v Speaker 3>It moves around a lot.</v>

2991
01:28:27.950 --> 01:28:28.200
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2992
01:28:28.200 --> 01:28:28.520
<v Speaker 3>Cool.</v>

2993
01:28:28.520 --> 01:28:29.151
<v Speaker 3>but it's weird.</v>

2994
01:28:29.151 --> 01:28:30.350
<v Speaker 3>These things are very directional.</v>

2995
01:28:30.380 --> 01:28:31.070
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>

2996
01:28:31.070 --> 01:28:31.480
<v Speaker 3>There we go.</v>

2997
01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:31.800
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2998
01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:32.633
<v Speaker 3>there</v>

2999
01:28:33.920 --> 01:28:37.270
<v Speaker 3>was the iranian theocracy is shia theocracy.</v>

3000
01:28:37.300 --> 01:28:39.320
<v Speaker 3>So that's extremely conservative.</v>

3001
01:28:39.410 --> 01:28:40.243
<v Speaker 3>Shia islam.</v>

3002
01:28:40.620 --> 01:28:41.090
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3003
01:28:41.090 --> 01:28:42.500
<v Speaker 3>the saudis are sydney.</v>

3004
01:28:42.590 --> 01:28:43.970
<v Speaker 3>It's extremely conservative,</v>

3005
01:28:44.510 --> 01:28:45.343
<v Speaker 3>sunni islam,</v>

3006
01:28:46.100 --> 01:28:47.510
<v Speaker 3>what do they hate about each other?</v>

3007
01:28:47.570 --> 01:28:48.680
<v Speaker 3>That they're willing to go to war,</v>

3008
01:28:49.690 --> 01:28:50.690
<v Speaker 3>the bronx successor.</v>

3009
01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:54.220
<v Speaker 3>So historicAl difference between shias and sydney's in it.</v>

3010
01:28:54.330 --> 01:28:56.360
<v Speaker 3>So it's like baptist going after catholics.</v>

3011
01:28:56.720 --> 01:28:57.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3012
01:28:57.430 --> 01:28:58.550
<v Speaker 3>sort of in that way.</v>

3013
01:28:58.970 --> 01:28:59.510
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

3014
01:28:59.510 --> 01:28:59.930
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3015
01:28:59.930 --> 01:29:00.763
<v Speaker 3>pretty much similar.</v>

3016
01:29:00.820 --> 01:29:03.270
<v Speaker 3>They just have different ideas of what the belief should be.</v>

3017
01:29:04.050 --> 01:29:04.651
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

3018
01:29:04.651 --> 01:29:07.860
<v Speaker 3>there is an element of labeling people who don't agree with you,</v>

3019
01:29:08.050 --> 01:29:08.821
<v Speaker 3>non muslims.</v>

3020
01:29:08.821 --> 01:29:12.040
<v Speaker 3>So a lot of saudis will say that the has are coffer,</v>

3021
01:29:12.060 --> 01:29:16.590
<v Speaker 3>there are apostates because they rejected belief in the caliphs um,</v>

3022
01:29:17.790 --> 01:29:18.211
<v Speaker 3>and then,</v>

3023
01:29:18.211 --> 01:29:18.330
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3024
01:29:18.330 --> 01:29:21.570
<v Speaker 3>that makes them punishable by death and then,</v>

3025
01:29:21.571 --> 01:29:21.781
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3026
01:29:21.781 --> 01:29:23.310
<v Speaker 3>you have to go out and you have to kill them.</v>

3027
01:29:23.790 --> 01:29:26.280
<v Speaker 3>And there's also an ethniC thing there too,</v>

3028
01:29:26.281 --> 01:29:26.461
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>

3029
01:29:26.461 --> 01:29:28.710
<v Speaker 3>the arabic and persian ethnic rivalry.</v>

3030
01:29:28.711 --> 01:29:30.480
<v Speaker 3>So it's extremely complicated.</v>

3031
01:29:30.481 --> 01:29:31.380
<v Speaker 3>And that's why bush,</v>

3032
01:29:32.130 --> 01:29:32.311
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3033
01:29:32.311 --> 01:29:37.311
<v Speaker 3>ended up in such a mess when he went into Iraq because I don't think he,</v>

3034
01:29:37.950 --> 01:29:40.650
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is a hard thing tO understand for a lot of people.</v>

3035
01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:43.500
<v Speaker 3>And apparently I didn't know from what I read to he,</v>

3036
01:29:43.501 --> 01:29:44.730
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he had any idea.</v>

3037
01:29:45.490 --> 01:29:49.620
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he knew the difference between shias and cindy's beyond just the</v>

3038
01:29:49.621 --> 01:29:50.454
<v Speaker 3>superficial level.</v>

3039
01:29:50.500 --> 01:29:53.230
<v Speaker 4>He probably had no idea that that was going to go down and there was going to be</v>

3040
01:29:53.231 --> 01:29:55.390
<v Speaker 4>some sort of a brutal civil war.</v>

3041
01:29:56.020 --> 01:29:58.660
<v Speaker 4>Try to reclaim power mean no one,</v>

3042
01:29:58.690 --> 01:30:02.950
<v Speaker 4>no one in this country had any idea that that was going to happen.</v>

3043
01:30:02.980 --> 01:30:07.120
<v Speaker 4>There was going to be a civil war between the two competing factions of islam.</v>

3044
01:30:07.400 --> 01:30:07.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3045
01:30:07.920 --> 01:30:08.170
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3046
01:30:08.170 --> 01:30:09.200
<v Speaker 3>I have a friend.</v>

3047
01:30:09.201 --> 01:30:09.500
<v Speaker 3>His,</v>

3048
01:30:09.500 --> 01:30:10.190
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3049
01:30:10.190 --> 01:30:11.440
<v Speaker 3>his name is festival pathar.</v>

3050
01:30:11.480 --> 01:30:12.590
<v Speaker 3>He is a,</v>

3051
01:30:12.800 --> 01:30:13.700
<v Speaker 3>he's an iraqi.</v>

3052
01:30:13.730 --> 01:30:14.110
<v Speaker 3>He was,</v>

3053
01:30:14.110 --> 01:30:17.390
<v Speaker 3>he grew up in Iraq and he started the global secular humanist movement while he</v>

3054
01:30:17.391 --> 01:30:18.224
<v Speaker 3>was in Iraq.</v>

3055
01:30:18.410 --> 01:30:22.160
<v Speaker 3>So he became a target for a lot of people and the global secular humanist</v>

3056
01:30:22.161 --> 01:30:26.300
<v Speaker 3>movement now has I think 300,000 followers on facebook and so on.</v>

3057
01:30:26.301 --> 01:30:31.130
<v Speaker 3>So it became a huge and he was also from a shia family and he was targeted by al</v>

3058
01:30:31.130 --> 01:30:33.410
<v Speaker 3>qaeda and they managed to kill his brother.</v>

3059
01:30:33.980 --> 01:30:35.330
<v Speaker 3>And then after that he went into.</v>

3060
01:30:35.400 --> 01:30:39.470
<v Speaker 3>He was running around all over all kinds of different countries until he finally</v>

3061
01:30:39.471 --> 01:30:40.820
<v Speaker 3>got refugee status in the us.</v>

3062
01:30:40.850 --> 01:30:45.850
<v Speaker 3>And he came here recently and he's full of stories about Iraq and how</v>

3063
01:30:46.190 --> 01:30:47.270
<v Speaker 3>complicated it is.</v>

3064
01:30:47.780 --> 01:30:48.613
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

3065
01:30:49.220 --> 01:30:50.930
<v Speaker 3>some of the other people I've talked to,</v>

3066
01:30:50.931 --> 01:30:52.170
<v Speaker 3>they say that the read,</v>

3067
01:30:52.171 --> 01:30:56.270
<v Speaker 3>the reason that saddam hussein was so effective is because he ruled with an iron</v>

3068
01:30:56.271 --> 01:31:01.220
<v Speaker 3>fist and he kept all of these sort of religious rivalries under control and he</v>

3069
01:31:01.230 --> 01:31:04.310
<v Speaker 3>presented to anybody he was fair to eat,</v>

3070
01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:05.151
<v Speaker 3>like pro secular.</v>

3071
01:31:05.151 --> 01:31:09.080
<v Speaker 3>A lot of these dictatorships are so they're secular and uh,</v>

3072
01:31:09.820 --> 01:31:10.011
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3073
01:31:10.011 --> 01:31:13.970
<v Speaker 3>they just didn't in the moment you took that fist away.</v>

3074
01:31:14.360 --> 01:31:16.520
<v Speaker 3>Everything just went nuts.</v>

3075
01:31:17.740 --> 01:31:17.951
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3076
01:31:17.951 --> 01:31:20.650
<v Speaker 4>That's what it seems like from our point of view,</v>

3077
01:31:20.680 --> 01:31:24.760
<v Speaker 4>from our confused point of view when all that was going down.</v>

3078
01:31:24.761 --> 01:31:29.550
<v Speaker 4>That was a very strange moment where most americans were standing back going,</v>

3079
01:31:29.560 --> 01:31:29.731
<v Speaker 4>wait,</v>

3080
01:31:29.731 --> 01:31:29.851
<v Speaker 4>wait,</v>

3081
01:31:29.851 --> 01:31:30.011
<v Speaker 4>wait.</v>

3082
01:31:30.011 --> 01:31:30.844
<v Speaker 4>What's going on?</v>

3083
01:31:30.870 --> 01:31:32.290
<v Speaker 4>Like they're competing against,</v>

3084
01:31:32.291 --> 01:31:32.381
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3085
01:31:32.381 --> 01:31:33.670
<v Speaker 4>they're fighting with each other,</v>

3086
01:31:33.671 --> 01:31:35.820
<v Speaker 4>like in their two rival sections of white.</v>

3087
01:31:35.821 --> 01:31:39.160
<v Speaker 4>But no one knew that there were rival factions of islam.</v>

3088
01:31:39.780 --> 01:31:40.600
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3089
01:31:40.600 --> 01:31:42.940
<v Speaker 4>this guy raise a aslan.</v>

3090
01:31:43.810 --> 01:31:48.340
<v Speaker 4>He is a very interesting sort of polarizing figure.</v>

3091
01:31:48.600 --> 01:31:48.940
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3092
01:31:48.940 --> 01:31:52.000
<v Speaker 4>some people think that he is a,</v>

3093
01:31:52.910 --> 01:31:55.120
<v Speaker 4>like an interesting historian,</v>

3094
01:31:55.121 --> 01:31:59.680
<v Speaker 4>a voice of reason and other people think he's completely disingenuous and not</v>

3095
01:31:59.681 --> 01:32:02.080
<v Speaker 4>just like incorrect about certain things,</v>

3096
01:32:02.081 --> 01:32:03.700
<v Speaker 4>but that he's just,</v>

3097
01:32:03.730 --> 01:32:04.080
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>

3098
01:32:04.080 --> 01:32:04.960
<v Speaker 4>he's full of shit.</v>

3099
01:32:05.140 --> 01:32:05.973
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3100
01:32:06.580 --> 01:32:10.150
<v Speaker 4>That's sort of sam harris's take on him is that he's just,</v>

3101
01:32:10.630 --> 01:32:11.680
<v Speaker 4>he's just dishonest.</v>

3102
01:32:12.150 --> 01:32:12.450
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3103
01:32:12.450 --> 01:32:14.960
<v Speaker 3>I agree with sam harris and I think he's very dishonest.</v>

3104
01:32:15.400 --> 01:32:16.480
<v Speaker 4>What is his objective?</v>

3105
01:32:16.510 --> 01:32:17.740
<v Speaker 4>Like what is he trying to do?</v>

3106
01:32:17.920 --> 01:32:21.940
<v Speaker 4>Because my friend duncan is enamored by my friend duncan read his book on jesus</v>

3107
01:32:21.941 --> 01:32:22.774
<v Speaker 4>and he's just.</v>

3108
01:32:22.870 --> 01:32:26.050
<v Speaker 4>He said it's an absolutely fascinating book and just really thinks the guy's</v>

3109
01:32:26.170 --> 01:32:27.130
<v Speaker 4>very interesting.</v>

3110
01:32:27.610 --> 01:32:31.510
<v Speaker 4>But then I talked to sam about him and sam said that he had some really</v>

3111
01:32:31.810 --> 01:32:33.370
<v Speaker 4>dishonest dealings with them.</v>

3112
01:32:33.430 --> 01:32:35.110
<v Speaker 4>Some conversations with them where,</v>

3113
01:32:35.180 --> 01:32:36.013
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3114
01:32:36.380 --> 01:32:36.741
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

3115
01:32:36.741 --> 01:32:38.240
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

3116
01:32:38.241 --> 01:32:39.560
<v Speaker 3>I've only read the stuff he's had.</v>

3117
01:32:39.561 --> 01:32:41.660
<v Speaker 3>I've had some exchanges with them on twitter and so on.</v>

3118
01:32:42.020 --> 01:32:42.640
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

3119
01:32:42.640 --> 01:32:43.460
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

3120
01:32:43.460 --> 01:32:47.570
<v Speaker 3>he's sort of like a very classic apologist and um,</v>

3121
01:32:47.630 --> 01:32:48.463
<v Speaker 3>and he's muslim.</v>

3122
01:32:48.790 --> 01:32:49.623
<v Speaker 3>He's muslim.</v>

3123
01:32:49.850 --> 01:32:50.370
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>

3124
01:32:50.370 --> 01:32:51.720
<v Speaker 3>I don't know about his belief.</v>

3125
01:32:51.830 --> 01:32:55.430
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure whether he really is a practicing or believing muSlim or not,</v>

3126
01:32:55.820 --> 01:32:56.510
<v Speaker 3>but he is.</v>

3127
01:32:56.510 --> 01:32:59.050
<v Speaker 3>He's definitely an apologist and he's one of these guys who whenever,</v>

3128
01:32:59.090 --> 01:33:00.830
<v Speaker 3>whenever anything terrible happens,</v>

3129
01:33:00.831 --> 01:33:01.131
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

3130
01:33:01.131 --> 01:33:01.281
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3131
01:33:01.281 --> 01:33:04.700
<v Speaker 3>we got to look for the root cause islam is not the root cause.</v>

3132
01:33:04.701 --> 01:33:09.130
<v Speaker 3>And at one point he sAid that I'm like his,</v>

3133
01:33:09.170 --> 01:33:11.270
<v Speaker 3>he's one of those guys who responds with everything by,</v>

3134
01:33:11.271 --> 01:33:13.340
<v Speaker 3>with accusations of bigotry and islamophobia.</v>

3135
01:33:13.940 --> 01:33:16.250
<v Speaker 3>Like he'll just cAll you a bigot and he knows,</v>

3136
01:33:16.251 --> 01:33:16.931
<v Speaker 3>especially that,</v>

3137
01:33:16.931 --> 01:33:17.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3138
01:33:17.100 --> 01:33:18.080
<v Speaker 3>people here,</v>

3139
01:33:18.081 --> 01:33:20.150
<v Speaker 3>especially liberal white westerners,</v>

3140
01:33:21.260 --> 01:33:22.790
<v Speaker 3>that's the last thing they want to be called.</v>

3141
01:33:22.970 --> 01:33:25.430
<v Speaker 3>It's just a great way to shut down the conversation.</v>

3142
01:33:25.431 --> 01:33:26.600
<v Speaker 3>Then people know this.</v>

3143
01:33:26.720 --> 01:33:29.450
<v Speaker 3>People in the muslim world generally they know this.</v>

3144
01:33:30.020 --> 01:33:32.690
<v Speaker 3>They know they can completely shut you up if you just accused.</v>

3145
01:33:32.790 --> 01:33:34.320
<v Speaker 3>They just accused you of racism.</v>

3146
01:33:34.321 --> 01:33:34.641
<v Speaker 3>And so there's,</v>

3147
01:33:34.641 --> 01:33:36.800
<v Speaker 3>there's so much guilt involved with that,</v>

3148
01:33:36.860 --> 01:33:38.030
<v Speaker 3>especially white people.</v>

3149
01:33:38.400 --> 01:33:39.233
<v Speaker 3>We're so guilty.</v>

3150
01:33:39.560 --> 01:33:39.741
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3151
01:33:39.741 --> 01:33:41.270
<v Speaker 3>And the dwight sort of western like,</v>

3152
01:33:41.280 --> 01:33:41.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3153
01:33:41.470 --> 01:33:42.530
<v Speaker 3>they mean well,</v>

3154
01:33:43.950 --> 01:33:45.410
<v Speaker 3>but they have the sense that they're like,</v>

3155
01:33:45.411 --> 01:33:45.800
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3156
01:33:45.800 --> 01:33:47.450
<v Speaker 3>we don't want to be called racist.</v>

3157
01:33:47.640 --> 01:33:48.980
<v Speaker 3>I want to be called bigots.</v>

3158
01:33:49.420 --> 01:33:50.253
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3159
01:33:51.350 --> 01:33:51.561
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

3160
01:33:51.561 --> 01:33:51.701
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

3161
01:33:51.701 --> 01:33:52.800
<v Speaker 3>and I think he kind of,</v>

3162
01:33:53.350 --> 01:33:58.220
<v Speaker 3>he uses that a lot and one of the things that he said for instances that he</v>

3163
01:33:58.221 --> 01:34:00.110
<v Speaker 3>actually wrote these books,</v>

3164
01:34:00.500 --> 01:34:01.640
<v Speaker 3>the koran the scriptures,</v>

3165
01:34:01.670 --> 01:34:04.430
<v Speaker 3>they don't mean anything in and of themselves.</v>

3166
01:34:04.820 --> 01:34:06.020
<v Speaker 3>These words have no meaning.</v>

3167
01:34:06.440 --> 01:34:08.600
<v Speaker 3>It is the people like a misogynist,</v>

3168
01:34:08.630 --> 01:34:11.990
<v Speaker 3>violent person will bring their meeting out and they'll see in it what they</v>

3169
01:34:11.991 --> 01:34:12.171
<v Speaker 3>want,</v>

3170
01:34:12.171 --> 01:34:14.900
<v Speaker 3>like as if the book is full of rorschach tests,</v>

3171
01:34:15.050 --> 01:34:16.040
<v Speaker 3>just like an ink blots,</v>

3172
01:34:16.450 --> 01:34:16.650
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3173
01:34:16.650 --> 01:34:18.650
<v Speaker 3>You can interpret and these words don't mean anything.</v>

3174
01:34:18.900 --> 01:34:19.733
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

3175
01:34:19.820 --> 01:34:22.160
<v Speaker 3>and I was just thinking about the implication,</v>

3176
01:34:22.370 --> 01:34:25.600
<v Speaker 3>and I wrote this for the richard dawkins website is a,</v>

3177
01:34:26.390 --> 01:34:26.571
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3178
01:34:26.571 --> 01:34:29.480
<v Speaker 3>if he's saying that like these people,</v>

3179
01:34:29.481 --> 01:34:30.860
<v Speaker 3>they didn't get their ideas from the book,</v>

3180
01:34:30.861 --> 01:34:31.940
<v Speaker 3>the book has nothing to do with it.</v>

3181
01:34:31.941 --> 01:34:35.150
<v Speaker 3>Then he's saying that all of the people in the muslim world are</v>

3182
01:34:35.151 --> 01:34:39.080
<v Speaker 3>disproportionately inherently violent and misogynistic,</v>

3183
01:34:39.280 --> 01:34:39.980
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3184
01:34:39.980 --> 01:34:41.630
<v Speaker 3>Because like the words don't have any meaning.</v>

3185
01:34:41.631 --> 01:34:44.420
<v Speaker 3>Then they've chosen to behave this way.</v>

3186
01:34:44.450 --> 01:34:47.390
<v Speaker 3>It's got to be something in their dna and they're rationalizing it with those</v>

3187
01:34:47.391 --> 01:34:48.800
<v Speaker 3>words that don't mean anything.</v>

3188
01:34:48.950 --> 01:34:49.783
<v Speaker 3>And that's bigoted.</v>

3189
01:34:49.990 --> 01:34:50.840
<v Speaker 3>You're essentially,</v>

3190
01:34:50.920 --> 01:34:54.890
<v Speaker 3>that's actually even more bigoted because you're saying that these people are</v>

3191
01:34:54.950 --> 01:34:55.850
<v Speaker 3>inherently like that.</v>

3192
01:34:55.851 --> 01:34:56.810
<v Speaker 3>It's in their dna.</v>

3193
01:34:56.960 --> 01:34:58.040
<v Speaker 3>That's the way the people are.</v>

3194
01:34:58.090 --> 01:35:01.670
<v Speaker 3>It's not that had been led by some ancient misled rather buy some ancient</v>

3195
01:35:01.671 --> 01:35:03.500
<v Speaker 3>ideology and you can't fix it.</v>

3196
01:35:03.770 --> 01:35:04.120
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3197
01:35:04.120 --> 01:35:06.170
<v Speaker 3>It's like because they're just like that.</v>

3198
01:35:06.350 --> 01:35:08.240
<v Speaker 3>So to me that actually sounds,</v>

3199
01:35:08.270 --> 01:35:09.920
<v Speaker 3>that's a much worse position to have.</v>

3200
01:35:10.220 --> 01:35:15.220
<v Speaker 3>It's a much more bigoted position to have and to neglect obvious causes.</v>

3201
01:35:16.750 --> 01:35:17.830
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

3202
01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:17.991
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3203
01:35:17.991 --> 01:35:19.520
<v Speaker 3>when we talk about root causes,</v>

3204
01:35:19.850 --> 01:35:24.290
<v Speaker 3>anytime someone says a allahu akbar there do something or they say,</v>

3205
01:35:24.291 --> 01:35:25.101
<v Speaker 3>jesus made me do.</v>

3206
01:35:25.101 --> 01:35:26.570
<v Speaker 3>It was kind of ignored that and like,</v>

3207
01:35:26.571 --> 01:35:26.721
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3208
01:35:26.721 --> 01:35:27.330
<v Speaker 3>let's ignore that.</v>

3209
01:35:27.330 --> 01:35:29.140
<v Speaker 3>Let's look beyond every time.</v>

3210
01:35:29.180 --> 01:35:30.680
<v Speaker 3>But when you're looking beyond something,</v>

3211
01:35:30.681 --> 01:35:31.940
<v Speaker 3>you're never going to see what's in front of you.</v>

3212
01:35:32.140 --> 01:35:32.510
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3213
01:35:32.510 --> 01:35:33.920
<v Speaker 3>So if I'm,</v>

3214
01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:37.790
<v Speaker 3>if I tell you I did something horrific act because it was,</v>

3215
01:35:37.791 --> 01:35:41.060
<v Speaker 3>my political beliefs are because I played a certain video game or I liked a</v>

3216
01:35:41.061 --> 01:35:42.400
<v Speaker 3>certain band or a.</v>

3217
01:35:42.470 --> 01:35:42.741
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

3218
01:35:42.741 --> 01:35:44.540
<v Speaker 3>I was pissed off about us foreign policy.</v>

3219
01:35:45.530 --> 01:35:47.030
<v Speaker 3>You'll take that at face value.</v>

3220
01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:48.590
<v Speaker 3>Everyone was like moments.</v>

3221
01:35:48.591 --> 01:35:50.030
<v Speaker 3>Anybody says us foreign policy,</v>

3222
01:35:50.570 --> 01:35:51.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3223
01:35:51.030 --> 01:35:51.471
<v Speaker 3>reza,</v>

3224
01:35:51.471 --> 01:35:51.890
<v Speaker 3>aslan,</v>

3225
01:35:51.890 --> 01:35:52.730
<v Speaker 3>glenn greenwald,</v>

3226
01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:53.580
<v Speaker 3>and I'll be like,</v>

3227
01:35:53.580 --> 01:35:54.413
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

3228
01:35:54.910 --> 01:35:56.060
<v Speaker 3>They said what the cause was,</v>

3229
01:35:56.061 --> 01:35:56.894
<v Speaker 3>we should believe them,</v>

3230
01:35:57.560 --> 01:36:00.320
<v Speaker 3>but way more than us foreign policy.</v>

3231
01:36:00.590 --> 01:36:02.780
<v Speaker 3>They're telling you why they're doing things.</v>

3232
01:36:02.900 --> 01:36:03.890
<v Speaker 3>They're doing it for god.</v>

3233
01:36:03.891 --> 01:36:05.180
<v Speaker 3>They're doing it for the afterlife.</v>

3234
01:36:05.670 --> 01:36:07.370
<v Speaker 3>And when we listened to that,</v>

3235
01:36:07.371 --> 01:36:08.810
<v Speaker 3>we don't take that at face value.</v>

3236
01:36:08.811 --> 01:36:09.260
<v Speaker 3>We're like,</v>

3237
01:36:09.260 --> 01:36:09.501
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3238
01:36:09.501 --> 01:36:10.340
<v Speaker 3>that's impossible.</v>

3239
01:36:10.370 --> 01:36:11.660
<v Speaker 3>It has to be something beyond it.</v>

3240
01:36:12.100 --> 01:36:12.860
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3241
01:36:12.860 --> 01:36:16.760
<v Speaker 3>it's the only thing that we don't believe that,</v>

3242
01:36:16.820 --> 01:36:17.061
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3243
01:36:17.061 --> 01:36:20.060
<v Speaker 3>religion and religious belief can actually do these things.</v>

3244
01:36:20.830 --> 01:36:24.370
<v Speaker 3>They can actually trigger people to act on them.</v>

3245
01:36:25.170 --> 01:36:25.910
<v Speaker 3>How do you,</v>

3246
01:36:25.910 --> 01:36:29.580
<v Speaker 3>that's almost impossible to fix it.</v>

3247
01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:29.901
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

3248
01:36:29.901 --> 01:36:31.160
<v Speaker 3>it's a tough thing to fix.</v>

3249
01:36:31.340 --> 01:36:31.731
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

3250
01:36:31.731 --> 01:36:32.564
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3251
01:36:32.690 --> 01:36:34.090
<v Speaker 3>there's this one after that,</v>

3252
01:36:34.091 --> 01:36:34.310
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3253
01:36:34.310 --> 01:36:37.940
<v Speaker 3>do you know about the attack on the school in Pakistan where they killed 100</v>

3254
01:36:38.930 --> 01:36:42.140
<v Speaker 3>people in 132 kids and they just went in,</v>

3255
01:36:42.230 --> 01:36:44.100
<v Speaker 3>there were like seven suicide bombers.</v>

3256
01:36:44.160 --> 01:36:47.930
<v Speaker 3>It just went in and they just took out all those kids under the age 12 to 14.</v>

3257
01:36:49.130 --> 01:36:50.180
<v Speaker 3>So that shook up the world.</v>

3258
01:36:51.170 --> 01:36:52.003
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

3259
01:36:53.180 --> 01:36:56.840
<v Speaker 3>after that I was talking online to this taliban sympathizer,</v>

3260
01:36:56.841 --> 01:36:58.120
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if he was a member of the band,</v>

3261
01:36:58.130 --> 01:37:01.040
<v Speaker 3>but he was definitely a sympathizer and you know,</v>

3262
01:37:01.041 --> 01:37:01.370
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

3263
01:37:01.370 --> 01:37:04.700
<v Speaker 3>he told me something that just completely like,</v>

3264
01:37:04.701 --> 01:37:05.930
<v Speaker 3>it was actually really chilling.</v>

3265
01:37:06.410 --> 01:37:07.490
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>

3266
01:37:07.610 --> 01:37:08.061
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

3267
01:37:08.061 --> 01:37:08.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3268
01:37:08.270 --> 01:37:09.103
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

3269
01:37:09.670 --> 01:37:11.840
<v Speaker 3>it's not that I believe in an afterlife.</v>

3270
01:37:11.841 --> 01:37:16.550
<v Speaker 3>I know there's an afterlife is like we don't think of death as an end.</v>

3271
01:37:16.900 --> 01:37:17.150
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3272
01:37:17.150 --> 01:37:18.740
<v Speaker 3>death is like,</v>

3273
01:37:18.741 --> 01:37:20.510
<v Speaker 3>this is just a human concept.</v>

3274
01:37:20.600 --> 01:37:21.051
<v Speaker 3>Something.</v>

3275
01:37:21.051 --> 01:37:22.850
<v Speaker 3>People who need to believe in materialism,</v>

3276
01:37:22.851 --> 01:37:23.630
<v Speaker 3>belief,</v>

3277
01:37:23.630 --> 01:37:25.190
<v Speaker 3>we know that death is not an end.</v>

3278
01:37:25.191 --> 01:37:27.410
<v Speaker 3>And then he pointed out the word,</v>

3279
01:37:27.860 --> 01:37:30.890
<v Speaker 3>which is the language from Pakistan for death,</v>

3280
01:37:30.891 --> 01:37:31.990
<v Speaker 3>which is integral.</v>

3281
01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.510
<v Speaker 3>And then the goal actually means transition.</v>

3282
01:37:34.750 --> 01:37:35.391
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mean,</v>

3283
01:37:35.391 --> 01:37:38.060
<v Speaker 3>and it doesn't mean death as we know it.</v>

3284
01:37:38.930 --> 01:37:43.010
<v Speaker 3>so you said even the word for death and the column means transition means you're</v>

3285
01:37:43.011 --> 01:37:44.060
<v Speaker 3>moving onto another world.</v>

3286
01:37:45.110 --> 01:37:47.050
<v Speaker 3>And then he went into more detail.</v>

3287
01:37:47.070 --> 01:37:47.481
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

3288
01:37:47.481 --> 01:37:48.230
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3289
01:37:48.230 --> 01:37:48.891
<v Speaker 3>these kids,</v>

3290
01:37:48.891 --> 01:37:49.011
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3291
01:37:49.011 --> 01:37:49.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3292
01:37:49.270 --> 01:37:51.470
<v Speaker 3>if kids have had the chance to sin,</v>

3293
01:37:51.830 --> 01:37:53.480
<v Speaker 3>there's a higher chance of them going to hell.</v>

3294
01:37:54.020 --> 01:37:55.350
<v Speaker 3>But if they're young and innocent,</v>

3295
01:37:56.230 --> 01:37:57.930
<v Speaker 3>then they're immediately going to go to heaven.</v>

3296
01:37:58.410 --> 01:38:03.180
<v Speaker 3>So we don't think of or we don't think that we're killing these kids and we're</v>

3297
01:38:03.181 --> 01:38:04.020
<v Speaker 3>ending their lives.</v>

3298
01:38:04.260 --> 01:38:07.500
<v Speaker 3>We think that we're actually sending them to a place where they're going to be</v>

3299
01:38:07.501 --> 01:38:09.920
<v Speaker 3>protected from their evil infidel parents.</v>

3300
01:38:09.960 --> 01:38:10.730
<v Speaker 3>Oh fuck.</v>

3301
01:38:10.730 --> 01:38:11.740
<v Speaker 3>and they're not able to sense.</v>

3302
01:38:11.850 --> 01:38:12.960
<v Speaker 3>And then he,</v>

3303
01:38:12.961 --> 01:38:13.620
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3304
01:38:13.620 --> 01:38:14.341
<v Speaker 3>he said that,</v>

3305
01:38:14.341 --> 01:38:15.174
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3306
01:38:15.180 --> 01:38:18.990
<v Speaker 3>if I'm trying to remember all of it because there was some really important</v>

3307
01:38:18.991 --> 01:38:19.530
<v Speaker 3>elements of,</v>

3308
01:38:19.530 --> 01:38:19.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3309
01:38:19.710 --> 01:38:20.101
<v Speaker 3>what he said,</v>

3310
01:38:20.101 --> 01:38:21.750
<v Speaker 3>that gives us insight into how they think.</v>

3311
01:38:22.120 --> 01:38:22.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3312
01:38:22.280 --> 01:38:22.741
<v Speaker 3>And then he said,</v>

3313
01:38:22.741 --> 01:38:24.300
<v Speaker 3>the reason that we blow ourselves up,</v>

3314
01:38:24.650 --> 01:38:25.050
<v Speaker 3>it was like,</v>

3315
01:38:25.050 --> 01:38:25.171
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3316
01:38:25.171 --> 01:38:26.320
<v Speaker 3>we were killing ourselves.</v>

3317
01:38:26.380 --> 01:38:27.510
<v Speaker 3>Death was such a bad thing.</v>

3318
01:38:28.020 --> 01:38:28.890
<v Speaker 3>We wouldn't do it ourselves,</v>

3319
01:38:28.891 --> 01:38:32.130
<v Speaker 3>but we know where we're going and we know where we're taking the kids as well.</v>

3320
01:38:32.131 --> 01:38:34.980
<v Speaker 3>So we just don't think of it in the way that you do.</v>

3321
01:38:35.310 --> 01:38:37.200
<v Speaker 3>And most muslims,</v>

3322
01:38:38.300 --> 01:38:41.040
<v Speaker 3>and he was talking about all the muslims condemning it and he's like most</v>

3323
01:38:41.041 --> 01:38:41.341
<v Speaker 3>muslims,</v>

3324
01:38:41.341 --> 01:38:42.570
<v Speaker 3>their faith is in this pure.</v>

3325
01:38:43.080 --> 01:38:46.560
<v Speaker 3>If they really believed that there was a heaven there were doing the right</v>

3326
01:38:46.561 --> 01:38:46.741
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>

3327
01:38:46.741 --> 01:38:47.574
<v Speaker 3>they're going to get there.</v>

3328
01:38:47.820 --> 01:38:49.050
<v Speaker 3>They wouldn't be mourning this.</v>

3329
01:38:49.051 --> 01:38:50.190
<v Speaker 3>There will be celebrating it.</v>

3330
01:38:50.320 --> 01:38:50.611
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

3331
01:38:50.611 --> 01:38:52.510
<v Speaker 3>but they are a poor faith and you know,</v>

3332
01:38:52.710 --> 01:38:54.030
<v Speaker 3>we're of the right faith.</v>

3333
01:38:54.330 --> 01:38:54.950
<v Speaker 3>And I say,</v>

3334
01:38:54.950 --> 01:38:55.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3335
01:38:55.260 --> 01:38:55.980
<v Speaker 3>when you.</v>

3336
01:38:55.980 --> 01:38:58.190
<v Speaker 3>So that's the mindset that you're going up against.</v>

3337
01:38:58.360 --> 01:38:59.230
<v Speaker 1>How do you fight it?</v>

3338
01:38:59.320 --> 01:39:04.030
<v Speaker 1>You fight it like that scene from aliens where he says you gotta pull out new</v>

3339
01:39:04.040 --> 01:39:04.873
<v Speaker 1>kit from orbit.</v>

3340
01:39:05.650 --> 01:39:08.830
<v Speaker 1>So ever see that scene where it's still tax different from what you were saying</v>

3341
01:39:08.831 --> 01:39:09.700
<v Speaker 1>about the drones.</v>

3342
01:39:10.670 --> 01:39:11.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3343
01:39:11.140 --> 01:39:13.660
<v Speaker 1>It seems like we need a nuke the entire world.</v>

3344
01:39:13.930 --> 01:39:15.910
<v Speaker 1>Start fresh with new monkeys now.</v>

3345
01:39:17.110 --> 01:39:18.520
<v Speaker 1>People are just so fucked.</v>

3346
01:39:18.820 --> 01:39:23.140
<v Speaker 1>The fact that a human being in 2015 can literally operate and think that way.</v>

3347
01:39:23.770 --> 01:39:23.960
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3348
01:39:23.960 --> 01:39:24.661
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

3349
01:39:24.661 --> 01:39:24.870
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3350
01:39:24.870 --> 01:39:26.050
<v Speaker 1>it was absolutely amazing.</v>

3351
01:39:26.380 --> 01:39:27.820
<v Speaker 3>But it's important to.</v>

3352
01:39:27.990 --> 01:39:31.450
<v Speaker 3>I think I was watching this movie and I know was it a tv show and someone said</v>

3353
01:39:31.451 --> 01:39:32.284
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>

3354
01:39:32.330 --> 01:39:33.163
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3355
01:39:33.340 --> 01:39:38.340
<v Speaker 3>where they said that moment you demonize your enemy or the moment you call your</v>

3356
01:39:38.381 --> 01:39:39.214
<v Speaker 3>enemy the devil,</v>

3357
01:39:39.940 --> 01:39:41.470
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to be able to understand them.</v>

3358
01:39:42.590 --> 01:39:42.920
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3359
01:39:42.920 --> 01:39:45.790
<v Speaker 3>the moment you've decided that there are the other,</v>

3360
01:39:45.800 --> 01:39:47.680
<v Speaker 3>and this is just pure evil,</v>

3361
01:39:47.950 --> 01:39:50.680
<v Speaker 3>you'll never understand their motivation for why they do what they do.</v>

3362
01:39:51.120 --> 01:39:51.920
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3363
01:39:51.920 --> 01:39:52.190
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>

3364
01:39:52.190 --> 01:39:53.110
<v Speaker 3>I think it's important.</v>

3365
01:39:53.170 --> 01:39:55.450
<v Speaker 3>Like that was a very eye opening conversation for me.</v>

3366
01:39:55.540 --> 01:39:57.700
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you know what I want.</v>

3367
01:39:57.701 --> 01:39:58.170
<v Speaker 3>Please go.</v>

3368
01:39:58.170 --> 01:39:58.610
<v Speaker 3>Go on.</v>

3369
01:39:58.610 --> 01:39:58.741
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3370
01:39:58.741 --> 01:39:59.100
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

3371
01:39:59.100 --> 01:39:59.770
<v Speaker 3>I was just saying I've,</v>

3372
01:39:59.770 --> 01:40:00.820
<v Speaker 3>I've heard that before.</v>

3373
01:40:00.850 --> 01:40:02.920
<v Speaker 3>People have told me that since I was a kid,</v>

3374
01:40:03.650 --> 01:40:04.870
<v Speaker 3>I was raised religiously.</v>

3375
01:40:05.210 --> 01:40:06.043
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3376
01:40:06.560 --> 01:40:06.831
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3377
01:40:06.831 --> 01:40:08.860
<v Speaker 3>that it's not permanent.</v>

3378
01:40:08.861 --> 01:40:09.310
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3379
01:40:09.310 --> 01:40:11.080
<v Speaker 3>life is just temporary and it's the afterlife.</v>

3380
01:40:11.081 --> 01:40:16.081
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think anybody really like truly truly believes that that's it.</v>

3381
01:40:17.170 --> 01:40:18.310
<v Speaker 3>And that's why this life is useless.</v>

3382
01:40:18.311 --> 01:40:22.510
<v Speaker 3>People still get upset when their loved ones die and they still fear death.</v>

3383
01:40:22.540 --> 01:40:23.373
<v Speaker 3>They don't want to die already.</v>

3384
01:40:23.890 --> 01:40:24.611
<v Speaker 3>If they really,</v>

3385
01:40:24.611 --> 01:40:26.290
<v Speaker 3>really thought that there were going to some place,</v>

3386
01:40:26.291 --> 01:40:27.130
<v Speaker 3>great afterwards.</v>

3387
01:40:27.131 --> 01:40:30.310
<v Speaker 3>So it wouldn't be that much of a fear of any of us.</v>

3388
01:40:30.311 --> 01:40:30.510
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3389
01:40:30.510 --> 01:40:31.440
<v Speaker 3>imagine like if you,</v>

3390
01:40:31.720 --> 01:40:32.231
<v Speaker 3>if he thought,</v>

3391
01:40:32.231 --> 01:40:32.381
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3392
01:40:32.381 --> 01:40:35.680
<v Speaker 3>my death is a fucking ticket to eternal bliss,</v>

3393
01:40:36.220 --> 01:40:38.950
<v Speaker 3>then it's not something that would scare you if you really,</v>

3394
01:40:38.951 --> 01:40:43.390
<v Speaker 3>really knew that these people really know that and they're all too willing to</v>

3395
01:40:43.391 --> 01:40:44.770
<v Speaker 3>kill themselves and kill others.</v>

3396
01:40:46.690 --> 01:40:50.470
<v Speaker 1>The charlie hebdo thing confused the shit out of me.</v>

3397
01:40:50.500 --> 01:40:52.810
<v Speaker 1>Not that people were willing to kill people over the.</v>

3398
01:40:53.350 --> 01:40:56.200
<v Speaker 1>I kind of already had that idea in my head,</v>

3399
01:40:56.410 --> 01:41:01.210
<v Speaker 1>but the reaction by a lot of left wing progressive people in the United States</v>

3400
01:41:01.211 --> 01:41:03.430
<v Speaker 1>condemning the racism of those cartoons.</v>

3401
01:41:03.910 --> 01:41:04.271
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3402
01:41:04.271 --> 01:41:06.670
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are you even talking about?</v>

3403
01:41:06.700 --> 01:41:11.700
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about a massacre and horrific murderous massacre and you've chose</v>

3404
01:41:12.851 --> 01:41:16.480
<v Speaker 1>to condemn the quote unquote racism of these cartoons,</v>

3405
01:41:17.170 --> 01:41:17.710
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

3406
01:41:17.710 --> 01:41:17.981
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3407
01:41:17.981 --> 01:41:21.340
<v Speaker 1>it's like killing the people that write mad magazine.</v>

3408
01:41:21.370 --> 01:41:22.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's not much different,</v>

3409
01:41:22.780 --> 01:41:23.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3410
01:41:23.120 --> 01:41:24.830
<v Speaker 1>mad magazine or you know,</v>

3411
01:41:25.010 --> 01:41:30.010
<v Speaker 1>name any sort of controversial south park going after the guys from south park</v>

3412
01:41:30.401 --> 01:41:31.390
<v Speaker 1>killing south park.</v>

3413
01:41:31.470 --> 01:41:32.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3414
01:41:32.080 --> 01:41:34.390
<v Speaker 1>It's killing matt stone and trey parker.</v>

3415
01:41:34.490 --> 01:41:34.841
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3416
01:41:34.841 --> 01:41:36.370
<v Speaker 1>it's not much different.</v>

3417
01:41:36.520 --> 01:41:36.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3418
01:41:36.830 --> 01:41:38.800
<v Speaker 1>They know.</v>

3419
01:41:39.340 --> 01:41:39.971
<v Speaker 1>What is that,</v>

3420
01:41:39.971 --> 01:41:41.830
<v Speaker 1>that apologist thinking,</v>

3421
01:41:41.860 --> 01:41:46.840
<v Speaker 1>that weird sort of thinking that's embodied by a lot of those really progressive</v>

3422
01:41:46.841 --> 01:41:47.674
<v Speaker 1>left wing,</v>

3423
01:41:47.940 --> 01:41:48.400
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3424
01:41:48.400 --> 01:41:50.500
<v Speaker 1>like really radical left wing people.</v>

3425
01:41:50.800 --> 01:41:51.730
<v Speaker 1>Like what is that?</v>

3426
01:41:51.810 --> 01:41:55.730
<v Speaker 3>There's a sensitivity to hurting people and hurting their feelings</v>

3427
01:41:56.410 --> 01:41:57.310
<v Speaker 1>over murder.</v>

3428
01:41:57.500 --> 01:41:57.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3429
01:41:57.690 --> 01:41:58.380
<v Speaker 3>Over murder.</v>

3430
01:41:58.380 --> 01:41:58.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3431
01:41:58.830 --> 01:42:01.890
<v Speaker 3>I think that they think they'll always say that I don't,</v>

3432
01:42:02.070 --> 01:42:03.450
<v Speaker 3>I'm not defending the murders.</v>

3433
01:42:03.510 --> 01:42:04.201
<v Speaker 3>That was horrific.</v>

3434
01:42:04.201 --> 01:42:04.890
<v Speaker 3>I condemn it,</v>

3435
01:42:04.890 --> 01:42:08.130
<v Speaker 3>but then there's always a button and then there's this whole sort of</v>

3436
01:42:08.580 --> 01:42:09.510
<v Speaker 3>Justification for it.</v>

3437
01:42:10.170 --> 01:42:12.540
<v Speaker 3>This is a sensitive thing for me because I,</v>

3438
01:42:12.541 --> 01:42:13.740
<v Speaker 3>I'm like a,</v>

3439
01:42:13.820 --> 01:42:15.660
<v Speaker 3>I'm a free speech absolutist.</v>

3440
01:42:16.080 --> 01:42:16.680
<v Speaker 3>Like I just,</v>

3441
01:42:16.680 --> 01:42:17.010
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3442
01:42:17.010 --> 01:42:17.731
<v Speaker 3>when I grew up,</v>

3443
01:42:17.731 --> 01:42:18.990
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of things I can say,</v>

3444
01:42:19.500 --> 01:42:19.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3445
01:42:19.780 --> 01:42:21.180
<v Speaker 3>I have a friend who is being,</v>

3446
01:42:21.210 --> 01:42:23.370
<v Speaker 3>was in jail for 10 years and he's being,</v>

3447
01:42:24.210 --> 01:42:27.690
<v Speaker 3>he's been sentenced to lashing for doing exactly what I do here,</v>

3448
01:42:27.900 --> 01:42:28.081
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

3449
01:42:28.081 --> 01:42:31.320
<v Speaker 3>So when I look at him and I both grew up in Saudi Arabia,</v>

3450
01:42:31.770 --> 01:42:32.760
<v Speaker 3>we're both writers.</v>

3451
01:42:32.850 --> 01:42:34.110
<v Speaker 3>We're both pro secularism.</v>

3452
01:42:34.740 --> 01:42:36.000
<v Speaker 3>But when I,</v>

3453
01:42:36.270 --> 01:42:40.560
<v Speaker 3>when I say something I can say it and there's no like,</v>

3454
01:42:40.640 --> 01:42:41.460
<v Speaker 3>it's fine.</v>

3455
01:42:41.460 --> 01:42:42.540
<v Speaker 3>And when he does it,</v>

3456
01:42:42.541 --> 01:42:43.920
<v Speaker 3>he gets slashed and tortured,</v>

3457
01:42:44.220 --> 01:42:46.440
<v Speaker 3>so free speech is a big thing for me.</v>

3458
01:42:47.370 --> 01:42:48.121
<v Speaker 3>So coming here,</v>

3459
01:42:48.121 --> 01:42:48.371
<v Speaker 3>like I,</v>

3460
01:42:48.371 --> 01:42:51.270
<v Speaker 3>I just don't think when it comes to the cartoons or the movie,</v>

3461
01:42:51.271 --> 01:42:51.930
<v Speaker 3>the interview,</v>

3462
01:42:51.930 --> 01:42:52.501
<v Speaker 3>people were saying,</v>

3463
01:42:52.501 --> 01:42:52.681
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3464
01:42:52.681 --> 01:42:53.610
<v Speaker 3>it's a shitty movie anyway.</v>

3465
01:42:53.611 --> 01:42:54.261
<v Speaker 3>I didn't think that.</v>

3466
01:42:54.261 --> 01:42:55.094
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was hilarious.</v>

3467
01:42:55.500 --> 01:42:56.460
<v Speaker 3>But the,</v>

3468
01:42:56.880 --> 01:42:57.091
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3469
01:42:57.091 --> 01:43:01.740
<v Speaker 3>when they start talking about the content of what is being criticized or attack,</v>

3470
01:43:01.741 --> 01:43:05.730
<v Speaker 3>I just think it's completely irrelevant in the context of what's happening.</v>

3471
01:43:06.290 --> 01:43:10.440
<v Speaker 3>Like it doesn't mAtter what was in the charlie hebdo</v>

3472
01:43:11.700 --> 01:43:13.710
<v Speaker 1>doing that because they're terrified of,</v>

3473
01:43:13.711 --> 01:43:18.570
<v Speaker 1>of retribution and they're so terrified that they're willing to side with the,</v>

3474
01:43:18.630 --> 01:43:23.630
<v Speaker 1>the murderous religious fundamentalists because they're almost Worried that</v>

3475
01:43:24.421 --> 01:43:25.830
<v Speaker 1>they're going to get attack themselves.</v>

3476
01:43:25.831 --> 01:43:26.071
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

3477
01:43:26.071 --> 01:43:26.401
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3478
01:43:26.401 --> 01:43:26.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3479
01:43:26.710 --> 01:43:29.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean those cartoons were kind of a really racist.</v>

3480
01:43:29.670 --> 01:43:30.151
<v Speaker 1>And they mean.</v>

3481
01:43:30.151 --> 01:43:30.984
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that the,</v>

3482
01:43:31.140 --> 01:43:32.460
<v Speaker 1>that the murders were cool,</v>

3483
01:43:32.580 --> 01:43:33.361
<v Speaker 1>but I'm sAying like,</v>

3484
01:43:33.361 --> 01:43:33.661
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3485
01:43:33.661 --> 01:43:36.780
<v Speaker 1>why are you promoting like horrible racist cartoons?</v>

3486
01:43:36.920 --> 01:43:37.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3487
01:43:37.140 --> 01:43:38.130
<v Speaker 1>let's look at that.</v>

3488
01:43:38.350 --> 01:43:38.471
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3489
01:43:38.471 --> 01:43:40.540
<v Speaker 3>that's where the islamophobia phobia comes in.</v>

3490
01:43:40.660 --> 01:43:41.493
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3491
01:43:42.950 --> 01:43:45.440
<v Speaker 1>They have a very certain way of talking.</v>

3492
01:43:45.680 --> 01:43:49.610
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever noticed these people that are super progressive and super liberal</v>

3493
01:43:49.611 --> 01:43:52.970
<v Speaker 1>and they have this weird of certain words and I mean,</v>

3494
01:43:52.971 --> 01:43:57.971
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that it's cool to mUrder all those people,</v>

3495
01:43:57.981 --> 01:44:01.100
<v Speaker 1>but liKe let's look at why were they so upset?</v>

3496
01:44:01.490 --> 01:44:02.323
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3497
01:44:02.530 --> 01:44:03.363
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3498
01:44:03.720 --> 01:44:04.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3499
01:44:04.400 --> 01:44:05.300
<v Speaker 1>it is what it is.</v>

3500
01:44:05.420 --> 01:44:06.770
<v Speaker 1>We live in an easy culture.</v>

3501
01:44:07.490 --> 01:44:09.740
<v Speaker 1>People are more upset about.</v>

3502
01:44:09.741 --> 01:44:10.574
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

3503
01:44:10.720 --> 01:44:12.530
<v Speaker 1>there's this value,</v>

3504
01:44:12.531 --> 01:44:14.000
<v Speaker 1>the value of freedom of speech.</v>

3505
01:44:14.270 --> 01:44:14.930
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3506
01:44:14.930 --> 01:44:17.240
<v Speaker 1>Which I think is extremely important taken for granted.</v>

3507
01:44:17.241 --> 01:44:18.620
<v Speaker 1>Very much so by americans.</v>

3508
01:44:18.621 --> 01:44:19.454
<v Speaker 1>And so yeah,</v>

3509
01:44:20.330 --> 01:44:22.040
<v Speaker 1>that's something that I ended festival there.</v>

3510
01:44:22.130 --> 01:44:23.410
<v Speaker 1>Guy from Iraq I told you about.</v>

3511
01:44:24.090 --> 01:44:25.250
<v Speaker 1>He says the same thing.</v>

3512
01:44:25.280 --> 01:44:25.401
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3513
01:44:25.401 --> 01:44:25.671
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

3514
01:44:25.671 --> 01:44:26.504
<v Speaker 1>when he came here,</v>

3515
01:44:26.660 --> 01:44:26.960
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>

3516
01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:30.170
<v Speaker 1>in a lot of people are sort of apologists about it because there's a freedom of</v>

3517
01:44:30.171 --> 01:44:33.350
<v Speaker 1>speech and then there is this sort of political correctness and not to offend</v>

3518
01:44:33.351 --> 01:44:34.130
<v Speaker 1>anybody.</v>

3519
01:44:34.130 --> 01:44:34.963
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

3520
01:44:35.450 --> 01:44:35.991
<v Speaker 1>people will say,</v>

3521
01:44:35.991 --> 01:44:39.140
<v Speaker 1>one thing I've been hearing a lot is a freedom of speech.</v>

3522
01:44:39.141 --> 01:44:40.490
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't mean the freedom to offend.</v>

3523
01:44:40.950 --> 01:44:41.783
<v Speaker 1>and I'm thinking,</v>

3524
01:44:42.060 --> 01:44:42.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking,</v>

3525
01:44:42.700 --> 01:44:43.050
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3526
01:44:43.050 --> 01:44:44.690
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what it means.</v>

3527
01:44:44.760 --> 01:44:45.171
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3528
01:44:45.171 --> 01:44:50.171
<v Speaker 1>There's no point of freedom of speech and it means you have the freedom to talk</v>

3529
01:44:50.271 --> 01:44:54.380
<v Speaker 1>about being offended by that freedom of speech that other person expressed.</v>

3530
01:44:54.410 --> 01:44:54.621
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3531
01:44:54.621 --> 01:44:55.451
<v Speaker 1>Everybody said that.</v>

3532
01:44:55.451 --> 01:44:58.430
<v Speaker 1>The fact that you can have this conversation about what freedom of speech means</v>

3533
01:44:58.431 --> 01:45:03.431
<v Speaker 1>is that's what freedom of speech is and if the whole reason it's protected so</v>

3534
01:45:03.471 --> 01:45:06.110
<v Speaker 1>strongly is because of the.</v>

3535
01:45:06.720 --> 01:45:10.340
<v Speaker 1>It means the right that all of us have to offend other people.</v>

3536
01:45:10.430 --> 01:45:10.730
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3537
01:45:10.730 --> 01:45:12.800
<v Speaker 1>Which was why I have a huge issue.</v>

3538
01:45:12.801 --> 01:45:16.190
<v Speaker 1>When people say something that other people deemed to be offensive,</v>

3539
01:45:16.400 --> 01:45:20.030
<v Speaker 1>they automatically go after their employers and try to get them fired.</v>

3540
01:45:20.031 --> 01:45:21.440
<v Speaker 1>Like this isn't just a freedom of.</v>

3541
01:45:21.860 --> 01:45:24.230
<v Speaker 1>You're not just speaking about them.</v>

3542
01:45:24.410 --> 01:45:27.830
<v Speaker 1>Now you're taking action to try to get them fired.</v>

3543
01:45:27.990 --> 01:45:29.060
<v Speaker 1>Which is very different.</v>

3544
01:45:29.450 --> 01:45:32.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is a very different kind of activism and it's,</v>

3545
01:45:32.341 --> 01:45:32.560
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3546
01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:32.910
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

3547
01:45:32.910 --> 01:45:35.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean like what you're doing is like,</v>

3548
01:45:35.511 --> 01:45:40.511
<v Speaker 1>it's like there's like there's a negativity attached to it that's very strange.</v>

3549
01:45:41.120 --> 01:45:43.640
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's an aggressive negativity,</v>

3550
01:45:43.820 --> 01:45:48.820
<v Speaker 1>a rebound from something that they believe is a incorrect weird that we have.</v>

3551
01:45:51.410 --> 01:45:53.390
<v Speaker 1>We have the right to have the right to be offended.</v>

3552
01:45:53.780 --> 01:45:55.850
<v Speaker 1>They don't have the right not to be offended.</v>

3553
01:45:56.060 --> 01:45:56.450
<v Speaker 1>You know that.</v>

3554
01:45:56.450 --> 01:45:57.283
<v Speaker 1>That's the idea.</v>

3555
01:45:57.680 --> 01:45:58.310
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3556
01:45:58.310 --> 01:46:01.070
<v Speaker 1>nobody has a right not to be offended if you don't like something.</v>

3557
01:46:01.220 --> 01:46:02.210
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to listen to it.</v>

3558
01:46:02.211 --> 01:46:04.340
<v Speaker 1>You can shut it down or counter speech with speech.</v>

3559
01:46:05.090 --> 01:46:05.810
<v Speaker 1>Exactly,</v>

3560
01:46:05.810 --> 01:46:06.320
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

3561
01:46:06.320 --> 01:46:08.720
<v Speaker 1>That's a very good way of putting a counter speech with speech,</v>

3562
01:46:08.721 --> 01:46:09.920
<v Speaker 1>kind of freedom with freedom.</v>

3563
01:46:10.440 --> 01:46:12.320
<v Speaker 1>If you don't like the way someone expresses himself,</v>

3564
01:46:12.321 --> 01:46:16.340
<v Speaker 1>talk about the way they express themselves and what you specifically you find</v>

3565
01:46:16.341 --> 01:46:17.151
<v Speaker 1>incorrect about it.</v>

3566
01:46:17.151 --> 01:46:18.650
<v Speaker 1>And that's how dialogues gets started.</v>

3567
01:46:18.950 --> 01:46:19.783
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

3568
01:46:19.820 --> 01:46:22.850
<v Speaker 1>people become illuminaTed by those sort of dialogues.</v>

3569
01:46:22.851 --> 01:46:24.560
<v Speaker 1>Even people that have opposing ideas.</v>

3570
01:46:24.590 --> 01:46:25.040
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

3571
01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:25.700
<v Speaker 1>you see,</v>

3572
01:46:25.700 --> 01:46:27.170
<v Speaker 1>you can see where a person comes from,</v>

3573
01:46:27.200 --> 01:46:28.490
<v Speaker 1>even if you don't agree with it,</v>

3574
01:46:28.491 --> 01:46:29.930
<v Speaker 1>you could see where a person comes from.</v>

3575
01:46:31.040 --> 01:46:31.191
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3576
01:46:31.191 --> 01:46:31.551
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3577
01:46:31.551 --> 01:46:32.320
<v Speaker 1>there's this,</v>

3578
01:46:32.320 --> 01:46:34.670
<v Speaker 1>we also talked about hate speech because I think one of the,</v>

3579
01:46:35.420 --> 01:46:37.510
<v Speaker 1>one of the biggest problems with France and europe is a,</v>

3580
01:46:37.820 --> 01:46:38.120
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

3581
01:46:38.120 --> 01:46:39.680
<v Speaker 1>a lot of european countries is that,</v>

3582
01:46:39.800 --> 01:46:39.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3583
01:46:39.990 --> 01:46:43.880
<v Speaker 1>they have laws against hate speech and the use of laws against hate crimes.</v>

3584
01:46:44.570 --> 01:46:47.960
<v Speaker 1>Hate speech is protected as part of free speech.</v>

3585
01:46:48.230 --> 01:46:49.650
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's right.</v>

3586
01:46:50.400 --> 01:46:54.510
<v Speaker 3>I number remember the westboro baptist church really where the supreme court</v>

3587
01:46:54.511 --> 01:46:57.130
<v Speaker 3>voted eight to allow them to pick a few notes.</v>

3588
01:46:57.690 --> 01:46:59.520
<v Speaker 3>And as you know,</v>

3589
01:46:59.600 --> 01:47:00.433
<v Speaker 3>as much as you,</v>

3590
01:47:01.020 --> 01:47:04.500
<v Speaker 3>that idea is important or anything of the westboro baptist church does is</v>

3591
01:47:04.501 --> 01:47:05.334
<v Speaker 3>important.</v>

3592
01:47:05.430 --> 01:47:06.263
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3593
01:47:06.390 --> 01:47:09.480
<v Speaker 3>that is a right and they should be able to do it as long as it's not a crime and</v>

3594
01:47:09.481 --> 01:47:10.314
<v Speaker 3>this his speech.</v>

3595
01:47:10.560 --> 01:47:10.741
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

3596
01:47:10.741 --> 01:47:10.891
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3597
01:47:10.891 --> 01:47:12.380
<v Speaker 3>they have In,</v>

3598
01:47:12.381 --> 01:47:12.841
<v Speaker 3>in France,</v>

3599
01:47:12.841 --> 01:47:14.370
<v Speaker 3>they've got holocaust denial laws.</v>

3600
01:47:14.490 --> 01:47:16.260
<v Speaker 3>They have rules against,</v>

3601
01:47:16.670 --> 01:47:17.150
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3602
01:47:17.150 --> 01:47:17.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3603
01:47:17.700 --> 01:47:18.533
<v Speaker 3>attacking,</v>

3604
01:47:18.880 --> 01:47:19.713
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3605
01:47:19.810 --> 01:47:20.643
<v Speaker 3>like the.</v>

3606
01:47:20.900 --> 01:47:21.691
<v Speaker 3>Let me put it this way,</v>

3607
01:47:21.691 --> 01:47:23.190
<v Speaker 3>the very same things,</v>

3608
01:47:23.280 --> 01:47:24.900
<v Speaker 3>same rules that,</v>

3609
01:47:25.210 --> 01:47:25.610
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3610
01:47:25.610 --> 01:47:29.580
<v Speaker 3>that their hate speech laws were actually used by the government at times to</v>

3611
01:47:29.581 --> 01:47:30.690
<v Speaker 3>warren charlie hebdo.</v>

3612
01:47:31.500 --> 01:47:31.651
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3613
01:47:31.651 --> 01:47:31.791
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3614
01:47:31.791 --> 01:47:33.330
<v Speaker 3>what you're doing is you're engaging in hate speech.</v>

3615
01:47:33.331 --> 01:47:37.530
<v Speaker 3>So the same hate speech laws that actually protected the killers,</v>

3616
01:47:38.550 --> 01:47:39.150
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3617
01:47:39.150 --> 01:47:42.540
<v Speaker 3>Protected their right to express themselves and to say,</v>

3618
01:47:42.541 --> 01:47:43.374
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3619
01:47:43.560 --> 01:47:45.900
<v Speaker 3>do everything from subjugate women to um,</v>

3620
01:47:46.170 --> 01:47:46.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3621
01:47:46.720 --> 01:47:47.553
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3622
01:47:47.810 --> 01:47:48.643
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3623
01:47:48.770 --> 01:47:51.270
<v Speaker 3>impinge on gay rights for instance.</v>

3624
01:47:51.720 --> 01:47:55.050
<v Speaker 3>I get all of those same things that seemed hate speech laws were used to warn</v>

3625
01:47:55.230 --> 01:47:56.610
<v Speaker 3>the charlie hebdo people.</v>

3626
01:47:56.611 --> 01:47:56.791
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3627
01:47:56.791 --> 01:47:57.230
<v Speaker 3>they had that,</v>

3628
01:47:57.230 --> 01:47:57.310
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3629
01:47:57.310 --> 01:47:58.410
<v Speaker 3>that fashion designer,</v>

3630
01:47:59.050 --> 01:47:59.400
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3631
01:47:59.400 --> 01:48:02.270
<v Speaker 3>who was arrested for antisemitic remarks that he made in a bar.</v>

3632
01:48:03.130 --> 01:48:04.140
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

3633
01:48:04.980 --> 01:48:05.270
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3634
01:48:05.270 --> 01:48:06.720
<v Speaker 3>so if you have hate speech laws,</v>

3635
01:48:06.721 --> 01:48:07.620
<v Speaker 3>if you have things like that,</v>

3636
01:48:08.190 --> 01:48:08.521
<v Speaker 3>then,</v>

3637
01:48:08.521 --> 01:48:09.210
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3638
01:48:09.210 --> 01:48:10.770
<v Speaker 3>that causes a lot of issues.</v>

3639
01:48:10.771 --> 01:48:14.760
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't work very well for people who are making the cartoons like charlie</v>

3640
01:48:14.761 --> 01:48:18.750
<v Speaker 3>hebdo and actually ends up protecting their attackers and their ideology.</v>

3641
01:48:18.940 --> 01:48:19.160
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

3642
01:48:19.160 --> 01:48:19.471
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>

3643
01:48:19.471 --> 01:48:22.650
<v Speaker 4>when I look at the apologists,</v>

3644
01:48:22.730 --> 01:48:23.840
<v Speaker 4>especially in America,</v>

3645
01:48:23.870 --> 01:48:26.240
<v Speaker 4>I often wonder whether or not it's a,</v>

3646
01:48:26.300 --> 01:48:27.650
<v Speaker 4>it's a case of people.</v>

3647
01:48:27.651 --> 01:48:29.480
<v Speaker 4>It's like very similar to people.</v>

3648
01:48:29.870 --> 01:48:34.010
<v Speaker 4>Like almost like winning the lottery and becoming spoiled and not appreciating</v>

3649
01:48:34.040 --> 01:48:38.900
<v Speaker 4>the earning of that money or someone who inherited millions of dollars.</v>

3650
01:48:38.901 --> 01:48:43.280
<v Speaker 4>And you usually find them all fucked up and drunk and they become drug addicts.</v>

3651
01:48:43.281 --> 01:48:44.420
<v Speaker 4>It's like they have.</v>

3652
01:48:44.450 --> 01:48:45.710
<v Speaker 4>They're so spoiled.</v>

3653
01:48:45.980 --> 01:48:49.970
<v Speaker 4>They're so spoiled by this freedom that they don't appreciate it.</v>

3654
01:48:49.971 --> 01:48:50.930
<v Speaker 4>It's almost like you.</v>

3655
01:48:51.080 --> 01:48:56.060
<v Speaker 4>We've had so much freedom and it's gone on for so long with no consequences that</v>

3656
01:48:56.061 --> 01:49:00.590
<v Speaker 4>until you actually see personally the effects of those consequences of free</v>

3657
01:49:00.591 --> 01:49:01.190
<v Speaker 4>speech.</v>

3658
01:49:01.190 --> 01:49:03.860
<v Speaker 4>You don't appreciate free speech for what it really truly is.</v>

3659
01:49:04.070 --> 01:49:06.080
<v Speaker 4>Like you may disagree with someone,</v>

3660
01:49:06.380 --> 01:49:09.620
<v Speaker 4>but if you disagree with their ability to express themselves,</v>

3661
01:49:09.860 --> 01:49:11.420
<v Speaker 4>you're part of the problem.</v>

3662
01:49:11.600 --> 01:49:12.433
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3663
01:49:12.660 --> 01:49:12.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3664
01:49:12.860 --> 01:49:14.240
<v Speaker 3>I agree with all of that.</v>

3665
01:49:14.810 --> 01:49:14.971
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3666
01:49:14.971 --> 01:49:15.530
<v Speaker 4>I mean you don't.</v>

3667
01:49:15.530 --> 01:49:16.220
<v Speaker 4>You might think those.</v>

3668
01:49:16.220 --> 01:49:18.140
<v Speaker 4>I think those cartoons or stupid as fuck.</v>

3669
01:49:18.141 --> 01:49:18.610
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't.</v>

3670
01:49:18.610 --> 01:49:19.610
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't draw them.</v>

3671
01:49:19.910 --> 01:49:21.860
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't waste my time drawing those cartoons.</v>

3672
01:49:21.861 --> 01:49:22.610
<v Speaker 4>I think they suck.</v>

3673
01:49:22.610 --> 01:49:23.540
<v Speaker 4>It's not my culture.</v>

3674
01:49:23.541 --> 01:49:23.830
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>

3675
01:49:23.830 --> 01:49:24.663
<v Speaker 4>I don't get it.</v>

3676
01:49:24.680 --> 01:49:27.710
<v Speaker 4>Maybe if I spoke french and I understood where they were coming from,</v>

3677
01:49:27.711 --> 01:49:28.790
<v Speaker 4>I would think it would be funnier.</v>

3678
01:49:29.180 --> 01:49:33.170
<v Speaker 4>But to think that there's something wrong with them doing it to the point where</v>

3679
01:49:33.171 --> 01:49:38.171
<v Speaker 4>you're bringing that up instead of a mass murder on a magazine,</v>

3680
01:49:39.140 --> 01:49:40.130
<v Speaker 4>the shooting the,</v>

3681
01:49:40.150 --> 01:49:43.820
<v Speaker 4>the cartoonists and did the thing you want to discuss.</v>

3682
01:49:43.821 --> 01:49:44.120
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

3683
01:49:44.120 --> 01:49:46.030
<v Speaker 4>well those cartoons are really racist.</v>

3684
01:49:46.031 --> 01:49:46.260
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

3685
01:49:46.260 --> 01:49:49.030
<v Speaker 3>The merit of content has nothing to do with it.</v>

3686
01:49:49.150 --> 01:49:51.470
<v Speaker 3>It shouldn't even be an issue or something.</v>

3687
01:49:51.570 --> 01:49:53.080
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know why it was an issue.</v>

3688
01:49:54.070 --> 01:49:54.820
<v Speaker 3>And I've,</v>

3689
01:49:54.820 --> 01:49:55.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3690
01:49:55.210 --> 01:49:57.010
<v Speaker 3>there's this idea that it supposing,</v>

3691
01:49:57.011 --> 01:49:57.191
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3692
01:49:57.191 --> 01:50:00.860
<v Speaker 3>we said that the cartoons were hate speech and they were criticizing and</v>

3693
01:50:00.861 --> 01:50:04.900
<v Speaker 3>ideology that a lot of people found out of the belief that a lot of people were</v>

3694
01:50:04.901 --> 01:50:08.920
<v Speaker 3>very sensitive about or like a historical or public figure who has been dead for</v>

3695
01:50:08.921 --> 01:50:09.521
<v Speaker 3>a long time.</v>

3696
01:50:09.521 --> 01:50:10.354
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

3697
01:50:10.570 --> 01:50:11.650
<v Speaker 3>the people are sensitive about.</v>

3698
01:50:11.830 --> 01:50:13.390
<v Speaker 3>So supposing you had that,</v>

3699
01:50:13.480 --> 01:50:14.313
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3700
01:50:14.650 --> 01:50:15.483
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

3701
01:50:15.730 --> 01:50:16.620
<v Speaker 3>sort of a,</v>

3702
01:50:16.900 --> 01:50:18.360
<v Speaker 3>even the competition there,</v>

3703
01:50:18.410 --> 01:50:18.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3704
01:50:18.640 --> 01:50:20.010
<v Speaker 3>pull out the va,</v>

3705
01:50:20.011 --> 01:50:21.460
<v Speaker 3>they used to lampoon religions,</v>

3706
01:50:21.960 --> 01:50:22.751
<v Speaker 3>all the religions.</v>

3707
01:50:22.751 --> 01:50:23.584
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't just own.</v>

3708
01:50:23.920 --> 01:50:24.131
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

3709
01:50:24.131 --> 01:50:24.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3710
01:50:24.520 --> 01:50:25.353
<v Speaker 3>pull out the bible,</v>

3711
01:50:25.360 --> 01:50:26.020
<v Speaker 3>pull out the chron,</v>

3712
01:50:26.020 --> 01:50:31.020
<v Speaker 3>opened it up to certain things and there's more hate speech.</v>

3713
01:50:31.210 --> 01:50:34.930
<v Speaker 3>And those books then there could ever be in the charlie hebdo cartoons,</v>

3714
01:50:35.590 --> 01:50:36.423
<v Speaker 3>like there's the,</v>

3715
01:50:36.500 --> 01:50:38.470
<v Speaker 3>if you're talking about incitement to violence,</v>

3716
01:50:39.040 --> 01:50:39.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3717
01:50:39.430 --> 01:50:41.170
<v Speaker 3>killing infidels apostates,</v>

3718
01:50:41.440 --> 01:50:41.741
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3719
01:50:41.741 --> 01:50:44.920
<v Speaker 3>go to deuteronomy and if you go to deuteronomy 20,</v>

3720
01:50:45.280 --> 01:50:45.910
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3721
01:50:45.910 --> 01:50:47.890
<v Speaker 3>and you read it reads like an isis rule book,</v>

3722
01:50:48.820 --> 01:50:49.330
<v Speaker 3>it says,</v>

3723
01:50:49.330 --> 01:50:49.691
<v Speaker 3>it says,</v>

3724
01:50:49.691 --> 01:50:49.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3725
01:50:49.870 --> 01:50:50.710
<v Speaker 3>go into the land,</v>

3726
01:50:50.711 --> 01:50:51.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3727
01:50:51.190 --> 01:50:54.820
<v Speaker 3>take the sword to all of the men that you can take the women and the children as</v>

3728
01:50:54.821 --> 01:50:55.271
<v Speaker 3>slaves.</v>

3729
01:50:55.271 --> 01:50:55.421
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3730
01:50:55.421 --> 01:50:56.890
<v Speaker 3>tHat's exactly what it says.</v>

3731
01:50:57.250 --> 01:50:58.210
<v Speaker 3>And then in the quran,</v>

3732
01:50:58.211 --> 01:50:58.751
<v Speaker 3>47,</v>

3733
01:50:58.751 --> 01:50:59.051
<v Speaker 3>three,</v>

3734
01:50:59.051 --> 01:51:00.100
<v Speaker 3>it says the exact same thing.</v>

3735
01:51:00.340 --> 01:51:01.750
<v Speaker 3>Well why is it then,</v>

3736
01:51:01.751 --> 01:51:06.751
<v Speaker 3>what is it about radical islam where they don't just have that written but take</v>

3737
01:51:07.901 --> 01:51:10.180
<v Speaker 3>that and use it in the form of practice.</v>

3738
01:51:10.181 --> 01:51:12.820
<v Speaker 3>Whereas radical christian fundamentalist,</v>

3739
01:51:12.850 --> 01:51:15.220
<v Speaker 3>very rarely go out and kill gays.</v>

3740
01:51:15.400 --> 01:51:16.540
<v Speaker 3>So very rarely,</v>

3741
01:51:16.980 --> 01:51:17.530
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

3742
01:51:17.530 --> 01:51:17.741
<v Speaker 3>YeaH.</v>

3743
01:51:17.741 --> 01:51:21.670
<v Speaker 3>They did do it for a long time at one point session during.</v>

3744
01:51:21.700 --> 01:51:21.971
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3745
01:51:21.971 --> 01:51:22.540
<v Speaker 3>So they did.</v>

3746
01:51:22.540 --> 01:51:23.170
<v Speaker 3>So it was,</v>

3747
01:51:23.170 --> 01:51:25.240
<v Speaker 3>it was during that time that they did do it.</v>

3748
01:51:25.241 --> 01:51:26.470
<v Speaker 3>And there is a response.</v>

3749
01:51:26.471 --> 01:51:28.030
<v Speaker 3>A lot of times when you talk about islam,</v>

3750
01:51:28.031 --> 01:51:29.920
<v Speaker 3>when you criticize islam as well,</v>

3751
01:51:30.010 --> 01:51:31.900
<v Speaker 3>christianity had its dark ages to,</v>

3752
01:51:32.100 --> 01:51:32.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3753
01:51:32.380 --> 01:51:33.220
<v Speaker 3>several centuries ago,</v>

3754
01:51:33.221 --> 01:51:33.461
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

3755
01:51:33.461 --> 01:51:33.641
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3756
01:51:33.641 --> 01:51:36.490
<v Speaker 3>and how would you have reacted when that was happening?</v>

3757
01:51:36.491 --> 01:51:40.240
<v Speaker 3>then that's the same way you have to approach what's happening now with this</v>

3758
01:51:40.241 --> 01:51:41.980
<v Speaker 3>song because you know they're going through the same thing.</v>

3759
01:51:42.370 --> 01:51:44.320
<v Speaker 3>The books are really not that different.</v>

3760
01:51:45.100 --> 01:51:46.720
<v Speaker 3>Like the new testament's a little nicer,</v>

3761
01:51:46.840 --> 01:51:50.020
<v Speaker 3>like in the new testament that all the torture begins after you die.</v>

3762
01:51:50.580 --> 01:51:53.890
<v Speaker 3>It's like the old testament's only during your life occur on.</v>

3763
01:51:53.891 --> 01:51:54.724
<v Speaker 3>It's a bit of both.</v>

3764
01:51:54.990 --> 01:51:55.360
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3765
01:51:55.360 --> 01:51:55.841
<v Speaker 3>but well,</v>

3766
01:51:55.841 --> 01:51:58.210
<v Speaker 3>how did christianity rise above,</v>

3767
01:51:58.240 --> 01:52:02.770
<v Speaker 3>how did they get past that into this lesser retarded stage that they're at right</v>

3768
01:52:02.771 --> 01:52:03.220
<v Speaker 3>now?</v>

3769
01:52:03.220 --> 01:52:05.480
<v Speaker 3>Secularism separating religion and state.</v>

3770
01:52:05.481 --> 01:52:09.130
<v Speaker 3>So the good thing about secularism is that it allows freedom of religion is the</v>

3771
01:52:09.131 --> 01:52:14.131
<v Speaker 3>only system that allows every religion to really openly the complete religious</v>

3772
01:52:16.001 --> 01:52:17.080
<v Speaker 3>freedom for everybody.</v>

3773
01:52:17.740 --> 01:52:18.401
<v Speaker 3>But at the same time,</v>

3774
01:52:18.401 --> 01:52:19.930
<v Speaker 3>it separates that from politics.</v>

3775
01:52:20.140 --> 01:52:23.700
<v Speaker 3>So it allows us to some of coexistence and um,</v>

3776
01:52:24.340 --> 01:52:25.173
<v Speaker 3>I kind of,</v>

3777
01:52:25.180 --> 01:52:28.480
<v Speaker 3>I always think that there's several steps to enlightenment.</v>

3778
01:52:28.481 --> 01:52:29.110
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3779
01:52:29.110 --> 01:52:32.020
<v Speaker 3>for me and lightened mid would be if nobody had any religious beliefs at all,</v>

3780
01:52:32.230 --> 01:52:33.880
<v Speaker 3>everybody was just kind of operating rationally.</v>

3781
01:52:33.881 --> 01:52:34.750
<v Speaker 3>That would be very nice.</v>

3782
01:52:35.210 --> 01:52:36.340
<v Speaker 3>Hasn't happened anywhere yet.</v>

3783
01:52:36.640 --> 01:52:37.960
<v Speaker 3>But I would say that,</v>

3784
01:52:37.961 --> 01:52:38.141
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3785
01:52:38.141 --> 01:52:40.930
<v Speaker 3>you'd have a reformation and after the reformation,</v>

3786
01:52:40.931 --> 01:52:41.051
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3787
01:52:41.051 --> 01:52:44.950
<v Speaker 3>that would get you to secularism where you separate religion and state and then</v>

3788
01:52:44.951 --> 01:52:45.860
<v Speaker 3>you move to a point where,</v>

3789
01:52:45.861 --> 01:52:46.011
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3790
01:52:46.011 --> 01:52:49.670
<v Speaker 3>people can actually have that conversation and they can reject irrational</v>

3791
01:52:49.671 --> 01:52:50.504
<v Speaker 3>beliefs entirely.</v>

3792
01:52:51.320 --> 01:52:54.590
<v Speaker 3>But the step before reformation nor to have a reformation,</v>

3793
01:52:54.770 --> 01:52:55.610
<v Speaker 3>you have to,</v>

3794
01:52:55.611 --> 01:52:56.340
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3795
01:52:56.340 --> 01:52:56.720
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3796
01:52:56.720 --> 01:52:57.860
<v Speaker 3>especially in the muslim world,</v>

3797
01:52:58.130 --> 01:53:00.700
<v Speaker 3>you have to reject the idea of scriptural than there and see,</v>

3798
01:53:01.400 --> 01:53:01.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3799
01:53:01.680 --> 01:53:04.070
<v Speaker 3>have to stop taking the quran.</v>

3800
01:53:04.071 --> 01:53:05.190
<v Speaker 3>Literally not,</v>

3801
01:53:05.270 --> 01:53:08.300
<v Speaker 3>not just justifying the stuff that's in there saying,</v>

3802
01:53:08.301 --> 01:53:08.700
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3803
01:53:08.700 --> 01:53:09.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3804
01:53:09.060 --> 01:53:09.831
<v Speaker 3>there's this in here.</v>

3805
01:53:09.831 --> 01:53:10.910
<v Speaker 3>We don't believe that anymore.</v>

3806
01:53:11.350 --> 01:53:11.900
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3807
01:53:11.900 --> 01:53:14.210
<v Speaker 3>and stop thinking that it's the literal word of god,</v>

3808
01:53:14.211 --> 01:53:15.410
<v Speaker 3>which is a very tough thing to do.</v>

3809
01:53:15.411 --> 01:53:16.100
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

3810
01:53:16.100 --> 01:53:16.670
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3811
01:53:16.670 --> 01:53:16.850
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3812
01:53:16.850 --> 01:53:18.580
<v Speaker 4>it's what,</v>

3813
01:53:19.100 --> 01:53:22.020
<v Speaker 4>what becomes the basis of your ideology then?</v>

3814
01:53:22.021 --> 01:53:24.830
<v Speaker 4>And it seems like people want an ideology.</v>

3815
01:53:24.831 --> 01:53:29.420
<v Speaker 4>They want to have some sort of a very rigid set of rules and patterns of</v>

3816
01:53:29.421 --> 01:53:31.580
<v Speaker 4>behavior that they're expected to follow.</v>

3817
01:53:31.760 --> 01:53:35.010
<v Speaker 4>And if those aren't coming from god and they're coming from men,</v>

3818
01:53:35.060 --> 01:53:35.960
<v Speaker 4>if they're coming from man,</v>

3819
01:53:35.961 --> 01:53:37.100
<v Speaker 4>they're open to dispute.</v>

3820
01:53:37.370 --> 01:53:39.050
<v Speaker 4>And that becomes the issue with a lot of people.</v>

3821
01:53:39.051 --> 01:53:43.790
<v Speaker 4>So much so that they're willing to accept these ideas that were written down,</v>

3822
01:53:43.791 --> 01:53:46.280
<v Speaker 4>that are preposterous if propose today,</v>

3823
01:53:46.670 --> 01:53:50.510
<v Speaker 4>like the ancient writings and stories from the bible,</v>

3824
01:53:50.540 --> 01:53:51.530
<v Speaker 4>from the old testament,</v>

3825
01:53:51.531 --> 01:53:56.531
<v Speaker 4>especially if you try to say today that you found a book and that this book was</v>

3826
01:53:57.471 --> 01:53:58.880
<v Speaker 4>written last week by god.</v>

3827
01:53:59.210 --> 01:53:59.760
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

3828
01:53:59.760 --> 01:53:59.980
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

3829
01:53:59.980 --> 01:54:01.250
<v Speaker 4>he wanted me to read it to you.</v>

3830
01:54:01.280 --> 01:54:01.761
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

3831
01:54:01.761 --> 01:54:04.160
<v Speaker 4>apparently fuck all these scientists.</v>

3832
01:54:04.400 --> 01:54:05.950
<v Speaker 4>There was actually just two people's,</v>

3833
01:54:05.960 --> 01:54:06.561
<v Speaker 4>adam and eve.</v>

3834
01:54:06.561 --> 01:54:07.670
<v Speaker 4>And that's where people came from.</v>

3835
01:54:07.671 --> 01:54:09.410
<v Speaker 4>An eve actually came from adam's riB.</v>

3836
01:54:09.710 --> 01:54:11.780
<v Speaker 4>So that bitches super lucky,</v>

3837
01:54:11.900 --> 01:54:15.320
<v Speaker 4>she fucked up the whole thing because she talked to the snake and she ate an</v>

3838
01:54:15.321 --> 01:54:17.120
<v Speaker 4>apple and the snake told her,</v>

3839
01:54:17.121 --> 01:54:17.631
<v Speaker 4>eat the apple.</v>

3840
01:54:17.631 --> 01:54:18.021
<v Speaker 4>But everybody,</v>

3841
01:54:18.021 --> 01:54:18.501
<v Speaker 4>god said,</v>

3842
01:54:18.501 --> 01:54:19.340
<v Speaker 4>don't eat the apple.</v>

3843
01:54:19.420 --> 01:54:20.270
<v Speaker 4>she ate the snake.</v>

3844
01:54:20.271 --> 01:54:23.680
<v Speaker 4>And so because that we're fucked and they realized they were naked and that</v>

3845
01:54:23.690 --> 01:54:24.051
<v Speaker 4>people go,</v>

3846
01:54:24.051 --> 01:54:24.221

3847
01:54:24.221 --> 01:54:24.351
<v Speaker 4>whoa,</v>

3848
01:54:24.351 --> 01:54:24.501

3852
01:54:27.490 --> 01:54:28.161
<v Speaker 4>Let's just stop it.</v>

3853
01:54:28.161 --> 01:54:28.330
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3854
01:54:28.330 --> 01:54:29.031
<v Speaker 4>Let's get outta here,</v>

3855
01:54:29.031 --> 01:54:29.510
<v Speaker 4>dummy.</v>

3856
01:54:29.510 --> 01:54:29.910
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

3857
01:54:29.910 --> 01:54:31.310
<v Speaker 4>Who taught you about life?</v>

3858
01:54:31.350 --> 01:54:31.610
<v Speaker 3>Let's see.</v>

3859
01:54:31.610 --> 01:54:32.221
<v Speaker 3>That's when you,</v>

3860
01:54:32.221 --> 01:54:34.530
<v Speaker 3>when you say all of that stuff and you know.</v>

3861
01:54:34.570 --> 01:54:35.403
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

3862
01:54:35.440 --> 01:54:35.930
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

3863
01:54:35.930 --> 01:54:38.790
<v Speaker 3>and when we were talking about mormonism in scientology earlier,</v>

3864
01:54:39.150 --> 01:54:39.391
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3865
01:54:39.391 --> 01:54:42.670
<v Speaker 3>this stuff sounds so much more insane than mormonism and scientific.</v>

3866
01:54:42.800 --> 01:54:43.820
<v Speaker 4>It's right up there.</v>

3867
01:54:43.821 --> 01:54:44.061
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3868
01:54:44.061 --> 01:54:46.330
<v Speaker 4>the scientologists tufts pretty fucking insane.</v>

3869
01:54:46.400 --> 01:54:46.820
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

3870
01:54:46.820 --> 01:54:47.690
<v Speaker 4>that is pretty insane.</v>

3871
01:54:47.691 --> 01:54:50.460
<v Speaker 4>But the whole thing about the theat tins and the,</v>

3872
01:54:50.480 --> 01:54:50.751
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3873
01:54:50.751 --> 01:54:53.780
<v Speaker 4>you're fucking from a volcano or some shit.</v>

3874
01:54:53.781 --> 01:54:55.820
<v Speaker 4>They dropped your soul cases really.</v>

3875
01:54:55.821 --> 01:54:56.654
<v Speaker 4>I mean this is,</v>

3876
01:54:56.660 --> 01:54:59.420
<v Speaker 4>this stuff is just as bad.</v>

3877
01:54:59.660 --> 01:55:02.420
<v Speaker 4>It's all obviously fiction,</v>

3878
01:55:02.550 --> 01:55:04.460
<v Speaker 4>all obviously fiction.</v>

3879
01:55:04.490 --> 01:55:09.490
<v Speaker 4>And the more we become illuminated about the actual true nature of matter of</v>

3880
01:55:10.821 --> 01:55:11.990
<v Speaker 4>biological life,</v>

3881
01:55:12.020 --> 01:55:15.200
<v Speaker 4>the process of adams and the,</v>

3882
01:55:15.270 --> 01:55:17.210
<v Speaker 4>the subatomic particles.</v>

3883
01:55:17.211 --> 01:55:20.840
<v Speaker 4>And when we get deeper and deeper into the very nature of reality itself,</v>

3884
01:55:20.960 --> 01:55:22.160
<v Speaker 4>the more we can explain,</v>

3885
01:55:22.161 --> 01:55:26.090
<v Speaker 4>the less religion becomes valid and the more it becomes pretty obvious that</v>

3886
01:55:26.091 --> 01:55:29.750
<v Speaker 4>someone in a very distant time where there was no science and there was no,</v>

3887
01:55:30.050 --> 01:55:34.100
<v Speaker 4>there was no base of knowledge where it had been accumulated over thousands of</v>

3888
01:55:34.100 --> 01:55:37.040
<v Speaker 4>years of people slowly but surely measuring things and figuring things out and</v>

3889
01:55:37.041 --> 01:55:41.600
<v Speaker 4>coming up with newer and better ways to measure things that were based on the</v>

3890
01:55:41.630 --> 01:55:43.260
<v Speaker 4>discoveries of people before them.</v>

3891
01:55:43.260 --> 01:55:44.093
<v Speaker 4>And we're all,</v>

3892
01:55:44.280 --> 01:55:48.240
<v Speaker 4>all of us mean the reason why we celebrate guys like isaac newton or darwin is</v>

3893
01:55:48.241 --> 01:55:53.010
<v Speaker 4>because we've all piggybacked on their discoveries and learned more in every</v>

3894
01:55:53.011 --> 01:55:54.680
<v Speaker 4>scientist and every biologist,</v>

3895
01:55:54.720 --> 01:55:57.030
<v Speaker 4>every anthropologists has dug up bones.</v>

3896
01:55:57.180 --> 01:56:01.050
<v Speaker 4>WE've added another little piece to this puzzle that's constantly evolving and</v>

3897
01:56:01.051 --> 01:56:02.100
<v Speaker 4>growing and changing.</v>

3898
01:56:02.370 --> 01:56:04.870
<v Speaker 4>And then something like religion comes along that says,</v>

3899
01:56:04.910 --> 01:56:06.690
<v Speaker 4>stop all this fucking learning.</v>

3900
01:56:07.170 --> 01:56:08.003
<v Speaker 4>Cut it out.</v>

3901
01:56:08.120 --> 01:56:13.120
<v Speaker 4>I mean the very idea of it is anti progress because you're supposed to rely on</v>

3902
01:56:13.441 --> 01:56:14.040
<v Speaker 4>some old,</v>

3903
01:56:14.040 --> 01:56:14.940
<v Speaker 4>ancient shit.</v>

3904
01:56:15.210 --> 01:56:20.130
<v Speaker 4>It's like going back to when galileo was imprisoned or copernicus was chastised</v>

3905
01:56:20.131 --> 01:56:22.140
<v Speaker 4>going back to when these people were were,</v>

3906
01:56:22.141 --> 01:56:27.141
<v Speaker 4>were thought of as enemies of god because they had these crazy ideas that we</v>

3907
01:56:28.141 --> 01:56:31.620
<v Speaker 4>today except as fact measurable fact,</v>

3908
01:56:31.950 --> 01:56:33.920
<v Speaker 4>undeniable fact they work</v>

3909
01:56:34.300 --> 01:56:36.580
<v Speaker 3>and that it's also the process.</v>

3910
01:56:36.581 --> 01:56:36.980
<v Speaker 3>I meAn the,</v>

3911
01:56:36.980 --> 01:56:39.220
<v Speaker 3>the what's at the heart of religion,</v>

3912
01:56:39.221 --> 01:56:42.400
<v Speaker 3>his infallibility like the idea that,</v>

3913
01:56:42.430 --> 01:56:42.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3914
01:56:42.680 --> 01:56:43.513
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

3915
01:56:44.210 --> 01:56:46.000
<v Speaker 3>this can't change that immutable.</v>

3916
01:56:46.240 --> 01:56:47.710
<v Speaker 3>So infallibility,</v>

3917
01:56:48.130 --> 01:56:49.660
<v Speaker 3>on the other hand with science,</v>

3918
01:56:49.780 --> 01:56:54.780
<v Speaker 3>the heart of a scientific inquiry is falsifiability,</v>

3919
01:56:55.630 --> 01:56:56.463
<v Speaker 3>which means,</v>

3920
01:56:56.530 --> 01:56:57.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3921
01:56:57.080 --> 01:56:59.950
<v Speaker 3>just the whole idea that you start with the assumption that,</v>

3922
01:56:59.951 --> 01:57:00.311
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3923
01:57:00.311 --> 01:57:01.420
<v Speaker 3>this could be wrong.</v>

3924
01:57:01.630 --> 01:57:03.000
<v Speaker 3>How do I prove that it's right?</v>

3925
01:57:03.400 --> 01:57:04.233
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3926
01:57:04.590 --> 01:57:05.620
<v Speaker 3>with faith it's different.</v>

3927
01:57:05.621 --> 01:57:08.050
<v Speaker 3>You start with the conclusion you're left with is my conclusion.</v>

3928
01:57:08.051 --> 01:57:10.990
<v Speaker 3>I don't need evidence for it and I'm going to work backwards and see what I can</v>

3929
01:57:10.991 --> 01:57:12.130
<v Speaker 3>do to strengthen my belief.</v>

3930
01:57:12.370 --> 01:57:12.551
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3931
01:57:12.551 --> 01:57:13.070
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3932
01:57:13.070 --> 01:57:15.340
<v Speaker 3>it's two completely different dynamics.</v>

3933
01:57:15.610 --> 01:57:16.443
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

3934
01:57:17.230 --> 01:57:17.710
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3935
01:57:17.710 --> 01:57:18.071
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3936
01:57:18.071 --> 01:57:20.080
<v Speaker 4>the idea that the two of them can coincide,</v>

3937
01:57:20.081 --> 01:57:23.200
<v Speaker 4>it seems less and less viable as time goes on.</v>

3938
01:57:24.280 --> 01:57:26.850
<v Speaker 3>the basics are the one that when you look at the basics,</v>

3939
01:57:26.851 --> 01:57:27.450
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3940
01:57:27.450 --> 01:57:28.470
<v Speaker 3>the way that they work,</v>

3941
01:57:29.100 --> 01:57:31.740
<v Speaker 4>and it also seems like as time goes on,</v>

3942
01:57:31.741 --> 01:57:34.460
<v Speaker 4>because of these ideas being less and less compatible,</v>

3943
01:57:34.500 --> 01:57:36.210
<v Speaker 4>the opposing factions,</v>

3944
01:57:36.450 --> 01:57:40.350
<v Speaker 4>science and religion are more vehemently opposed to each other.</v>

3945
01:57:40.660 --> 01:57:45.430
<v Speaker 4>They're more aggressive about their deniaL or the more aggressive about their</v>

3946
01:57:46.520 --> 01:57:51.520
<v Speaker 4>non accepting of these fundamentalist ideas that scientists today are more</v>

3947
01:57:52.440 --> 01:57:57.060
<v Speaker 4>aggressive about their ideas that atheism is the way to go and that these</v>

3948
01:57:57.360 --> 01:58:01.290
<v Speaker 4>religious fundamentalists ideas that are being pushed on people are,</v>

3949
01:58:01.580 --> 01:58:01.830
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3950
01:58:01.830 --> 01:58:06.830
<v Speaker 4>a form of ideological poison they fuck with the mind because they give the mind</v>

3951
01:58:08.100 --> 01:58:12.000
<v Speaker 4>these very rigid patterns that you're expected to adhere,</v>

3952
01:58:12.001 --> 01:58:12.570
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

3953
01:58:12.570 --> 01:58:13.403
<v Speaker 4>conform to.</v>

3954
01:58:13.650 --> 01:58:14.730
<v Speaker 4>And if you do not,</v>

3955
01:58:14.940 --> 01:58:16.110
<v Speaker 4>I mean the idea of like,</v>

3956
01:58:16.111 --> 01:58:18.480
<v Speaker 4>if you don't believe or you fall out of faith,</v>

3957
01:58:18.481 --> 01:58:18.850
<v Speaker 4>you should.</v>

3958
01:58:18.850 --> 01:58:20.340
<v Speaker 4>You're supposed to have your head removed.</v>

3959
01:58:20.680 --> 01:58:22.140
<v Speaker 4>I mean that should tell you right there.</v>

3960
01:58:22.141 --> 01:58:22.430
<v Speaker 4>what is,</v>

3961
01:58:22.430 --> 01:58:23.101
<v Speaker 4>where do you think,</v>

3962
01:58:23.101 --> 01:58:25.650
<v Speaker 4>you think with your fucking head while you've been thinking too much.</v>

3963
01:58:25.710 --> 01:58:27.210
<v Speaker 4>So we're going to cut your fucking head off.</v>

3964
01:58:27.220 --> 01:58:31.740
<v Speaker 4>You don't think you need to abide by this shit that was written down on</v>

3965
01:58:31.800 --> 01:58:36.030
<v Speaker 4>parchment back when they thought the world was flat and the sun was 17 miles</v>

3966
01:58:36.031 --> 01:58:36.780
<v Speaker 4>away.</v>

3967
01:58:36.780 --> 01:58:41.040
<v Speaker 4>That's what you need to abide by because otherwise you're going to fuck up</v>

3968
01:58:41.170 --> 01:58:42.003
<v Speaker 4>party.</v>

3969
01:58:42.480 --> 01:58:42.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3970
01:58:42.710 --> 01:58:46.960
<v Speaker 3>Does it kind of brings you back to the whole community thing that I think a lot</v>

3971
01:58:46.961 --> 01:58:47.321
<v Speaker 3>of people,</v>

3972
01:58:47.321 --> 01:58:52.321
<v Speaker 3>they want that identification and they want that sense of identity and group</v>

3973
01:58:52.841 --> 01:58:54.250
<v Speaker 3>identity that religion gives them.</v>

3974
01:58:54.251 --> 01:58:54.580
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

3975
01:58:54.580 --> 01:58:57.460
<v Speaker 3>they needed so much that that's why they take.</v>

3976
01:58:57.520 --> 01:59:02.520
<v Speaker 3>I'm just attacks on their ideology personally cheer when there's reprisal for</v>

3977
01:59:04.511 --> 01:59:05.344
<v Speaker 3>these attacks,</v>

3978
01:59:05.710 --> 01:59:06.810
<v Speaker 3>these verbal attacks on there.</v>

3979
01:59:06.820 --> 01:59:10.810
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's people that cheered when those guys were murdered.</v>

3980
01:59:11.270 --> 01:59:15.190
<v Speaker 3>Those people that cheered all in a where I grew up,</v>

3981
01:59:15.191 --> 01:59:16.780
<v Speaker 3>people used to celebrate it all the time.</v>

3982
01:59:16.960 --> 01:59:18.790
<v Speaker 3>I mean like educated people,</v>

3983
01:59:18.791 --> 01:59:23.290
<v Speaker 3>they wouldn't say it to like within our own living room we were sitting there</v>

3984
01:59:23.370 --> 01:59:23.710
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>

3985
01:59:23.710 --> 01:59:24.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3986
01:59:24.010 --> 01:59:26.200
<v Speaker 3>educated uncles and aunts who had,</v>

3987
01:59:26.640 --> 01:59:26.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3988
01:59:26.950 --> 01:59:29.440
<v Speaker 3>been overseas and they'd studied overseas.</v>

3989
01:59:29.441 --> 01:59:30.041
<v Speaker 3>They came back,</v>

3990
01:59:30.041 --> 01:59:30.281
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3991
01:59:30.281 --> 01:59:33.430
<v Speaker 3>when something like nine slash 11 would happen or you know,</v>

3992
01:59:33.431 --> 01:59:35.170
<v Speaker 3>any kind of attack against America would happen.</v>

3993
01:59:35.170 --> 01:59:36.190
<v Speaker 3>Even civilians,</v>

3994
01:59:36.380 --> 01:59:36.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3995
01:59:36.750 --> 01:59:38.020
<v Speaker 3>be completely supportive of it,</v>

3996
01:59:38.500 --> 01:59:39.490
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

3997
01:59:39.491 --> 01:59:44.020
<v Speaker 3>when they'd go out and they talked to their white friends and be like,</v>

3998
01:59:44.021 --> 01:59:44.231
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3999
01:59:44.231 --> 01:59:44.381
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

4000
01:59:44.381 --> 01:59:45.071
<v Speaker 3>this is terrible.</v>

4001
01:59:45.071 --> 01:59:45.904
<v Speaker 3>We condemn it.</v>

4002
01:59:46.120 --> 01:59:46.631
<v Speaker 3>There are,</v>

4003
01:59:46.631 --> 01:59:49.900
<v Speaker 3>there are root causes far do we should understand what their legitimate</v>

4004
01:59:49.901 --> 01:59:52.000
<v Speaker 3>grievances are and why they did it.</v>

4005
01:59:52.001 --> 01:59:53.530
<v Speaker 3>But that doesn't justify the murder.</v>

4006
01:59:53.740 --> 01:59:56.740
<v Speaker 3>But alone in your house they will tell a lot of times.</v>

4007
01:59:56.790 --> 01:59:57.623
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4008
01:59:57.670 --> 01:59:58.420
<v Speaker 3>Fortunately,</v>

4009
01:59:58.420 --> 02:00:00.160
<v Speaker 3>not particularly in my house,</v>

4010
02:00:00.161 --> 02:00:01.930
<v Speaker 3>but extended family,</v>

4011
02:00:01.990 --> 02:00:02.411
<v Speaker 3>family,</v>

4012
02:00:02.411 --> 02:00:02.801
<v Speaker 3>friends.</v>

4013
02:00:02.801 --> 02:00:04.480
<v Speaker 3>I mean just on a daily basis,</v>

4014
02:00:04.520 --> 02:00:05.620
<v Speaker 3>we're surrounded by it.</v>

4015
02:00:05.621 --> 02:00:08.350
<v Speaker 3>I mean when the [inaudible] came down,</v>

4016
02:00:08.890 --> 02:00:09.723
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4017
02:00:09.790 --> 02:00:10.001
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4018
02:00:10.001 --> 02:00:12.070
<v Speaker 3>a lot of my extended family,</v>

4019
02:00:12.071 --> 02:00:13.030
<v Speaker 3>a lot of my friends,</v>

4020
02:00:13.500 --> 02:00:14.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4021
02:00:14.140 --> 02:00:15.580
<v Speaker 3>teachers at school and everything,</v>

4022
02:00:15.581 --> 02:00:15.761
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

4023
02:00:15.761 --> 02:00:17.050
<v Speaker 3>they all supported it.</v>

4024
02:00:17.980 --> 02:00:18.813
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4025
02:00:19.270 --> 02:00:21.430
<v Speaker 3>There was a guy who wrote a book,</v>

4026
02:00:21.910 --> 02:00:23.140
<v Speaker 3>not even a good book.</v>

4027
02:00:24.120 --> 02:00:24.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4028
02:00:24.460 --> 02:00:25.151
<v Speaker 3>He was never,</v>

4029
02:00:25.151 --> 02:00:26.440
<v Speaker 3>I've never been able to read it.</v>

4030
02:00:26.620 --> 02:00:29.350
<v Speaker 3>Like I liked it and I've read some of his stuff,</v>

4031
02:00:29.351 --> 02:00:31.150
<v Speaker 3>but satanic verses just couldn't.</v>

4032
02:00:31.151 --> 02:00:33.070
<v Speaker 3>It's just really dense and I can't,</v>

4033
02:00:33.300 --> 02:00:33.880
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4034
02:00:33.880 --> 02:00:34.420
<v Speaker 3>can't.</v>

4035
02:00:34.420 --> 02:00:35.650
<v Speaker 3>It's not interesting.</v>

4036
02:00:36.150 --> 02:00:36.530
<v Speaker 3>It just,</v>

4037
02:00:36.530 --> 02:00:37.363
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

4038
02:00:37.380 --> 02:00:39.070
<v Speaker 3>it takes a lot of focus,</v>

4039
02:00:39.071 --> 02:00:40.710
<v Speaker 3>I think to really get through it.</v>

4040
02:00:40.720 --> 02:00:41.920
<v Speaker 3>You need to sit down and really,</v>

4041
02:00:42.440 --> 02:00:43.870
<v Speaker 3>well you need to be interested in it.</v>

4042
02:00:44.290 --> 02:00:45.810
<v Speaker 3>But it's just bizarre because I mean,</v>

4043
02:00:45.820 --> 02:00:47.920
<v Speaker 3>it's not even specifically about mohammed,</v>

4044
02:00:47.921 --> 02:00:48.191
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4045
02:00:48.191 --> 02:00:48.770
<v Speaker 3>I meaN the,</v>

4046
02:00:48.770 --> 02:00:49.140
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

4047
02:00:49.140 --> 02:00:52.190
<v Speaker 3>the autonomy versus sit down.</v>

4048
02:00:52.440 --> 02:00:53.211
<v Speaker 3>It is kind of a,</v>

4049
02:00:53.211 --> 02:00:54.460
<v Speaker 3>It is about mohammed's life.</v>

4050
02:00:54.490 --> 02:00:58.570
<v Speaker 3>Sort of the satanic verses where I guess the way the qur'an was supposedly</v>

4051
02:00:58.590 --> 02:01:02.830
<v Speaker 3>revealed was that mom had got these revelations from above.</v>

4052
02:01:03.250 --> 02:01:04.240
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

4053
02:01:04.660 --> 02:01:09.570
<v Speaker 3>at one point he got these revelations that said that idolatry,</v>

4054
02:01:09.610 --> 02:01:10.890
<v Speaker 3>certain elements of idolatry or,</v>

4055
02:01:10.900 --> 02:01:11.410
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

4056
02:01:11.410 --> 02:01:12.910
<v Speaker 3>it was like these three idol gods and,</v>

4057
02:01:12.911 --> 02:01:13.151
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4058
02:01:13.151 --> 02:01:13.391
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

4059
02:01:13.391 --> 02:01:13.871
<v Speaker 3>fine,</v>

4060
02:01:13.871 --> 02:01:16.960
<v Speaker 3>we can respect that or people that follow them,</v>

4061
02:01:16.961 --> 02:01:17.794
<v Speaker 3>but they're okay.</v>

4062
02:01:17.980 --> 02:01:18.813
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4063
02:01:19.030 --> 02:01:20.080
<v Speaker 3>and then later on he's like,</v>

4064
02:01:20.081 --> 02:01:20.261
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

4065
02:01:20.261 --> 02:01:20.350
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

4066
02:01:20.350 --> 02:01:21.430
<v Speaker 3>that was satan talking to me.</v>

4067
02:01:21.431 --> 02:01:22.264
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't goD.</v>

4068
02:01:22.330 --> 02:01:24.160
<v Speaker 3>So those were the satanic verses.</v>

4069
02:01:24.790 --> 02:01:29.790
<v Speaker 3>So they didn't end up being part of the koran and that's where some unrest.</v>

4070
02:01:30.690 --> 02:01:31.361
<v Speaker 3>he got the idea.</v>

4071
02:01:31.361 --> 02:01:32.171
<v Speaker 3>So it was,</v>

4072
02:01:32.171 --> 02:01:33.270
<v Speaker 3>it was based on a,</v>

4073
02:01:33.430 --> 02:01:34.263
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4074
02:01:34.460 --> 02:01:38.080
<v Speaker 3>on an actual documented piece of sort of islamic history.</v>

4075
02:01:38.770 --> 02:01:39.740
<v Speaker 3>And he did,</v>

4076
02:01:39.980 --> 02:01:44.540
<v Speaker 3>he changed the name of mama and he had a lot of similar elements was symbolic of</v>

4077
02:01:44.541 --> 02:01:45.021
<v Speaker 3>his life,</v>

4078
02:01:45.021 --> 02:01:45.550
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

4079
02:01:45.550 --> 02:01:47.020
<v Speaker 1>so because he changed the name,</v>

4080
02:01:47.021 --> 02:01:48.250
<v Speaker 1>he thought he was going to be okay.</v>

4081
02:01:48.850 --> 02:01:49.001
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4082
02:01:49.001 --> 02:01:50.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean he knew that it was a satire,</v>

4083
02:01:50.651 --> 02:01:50.860
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

4084
02:01:50.860 --> 02:01:51.041
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4085
02:01:51.041 --> 02:01:51.874
<v Speaker 1>like animal farm,</v>

4086
02:01:52.550 --> 02:01:54.430
<v Speaker 1>they use animals to represent like real people.</v>

4087
02:01:54.540 --> 02:01:55.100
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4088
02:01:55.100 --> 02:01:55.380
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4089
02:01:55.380 --> 02:01:56.340
<v Speaker 3>so he did this,</v>

4090
02:01:56.341 --> 02:01:58.230
<v Speaker 3>he had fictional characters then,</v>

4091
02:01:58.231 --> 02:01:58.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4092
02:01:58.440 --> 02:01:59.700
<v Speaker 3>the sort of different time settings</v>

4093
02:01:59.840 --> 02:02:03.010
<v Speaker 1>and he thought it would be okay because he had fictional characters because he</v>

4094
02:02:03.040 --> 02:02:04.550
<v Speaker 1>mentioned mohammed by name.</v>

4095
02:02:04.800 --> 02:02:05.110
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

4096
02:02:05.110 --> 02:02:05.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

4097
02:02:05.660 --> 02:02:07.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he thought it would be okay.</v>

4098
02:02:07.791 --> 02:02:08.624
<v Speaker 1>I knew.</v>

4099
02:02:08.830 --> 02:02:09.663
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think</v>

4100
02:02:09.680 --> 02:02:12.740
<v Speaker 3>he knew that there would be some backlash.</v>

4101
02:02:12.741 --> 02:02:14.000
<v Speaker 3>I didn't think at that time.</v>

4102
02:02:14.450 --> 02:02:17.000
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure if he really thought that he would have to go under a heading.</v>

4103
02:02:17.320 --> 02:02:18.480
<v Speaker 1>Probably would've never wrote it.</v>

4104
02:02:19.170 --> 02:02:19.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4105
02:02:19.830 --> 02:02:21.180
<v Speaker 1>what is he okay.</v>

4106
02:02:21.181 --> 02:02:23.100
<v Speaker 1>Now is he allowed to just go anywhere now?</v>

4107
02:02:23.101 --> 02:02:25.380
<v Speaker 1>Like did they ever release?</v>

4108
02:02:25.570 --> 02:02:26.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't have him.</v>

4109
02:02:27.110 --> 02:02:28.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he travels with armed security,</v>

4110
02:02:28.981 --> 02:02:29.361
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't,</v>

4111
02:02:29.361 --> 02:02:30.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't know him personally,</v>

4112
02:02:30.241 --> 02:02:30.810
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

4113
02:02:30.810 --> 02:02:31.171
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

4114
02:02:31.171 --> 02:02:32.004
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4115
02:02:32.430 --> 02:02:35.080
<v Speaker 3>he does tend to do all the talk shows and everything.</v>

4116
02:02:35.140 --> 02:02:37.860
<v Speaker 3>He was really under hiding in those first 10 years.</v>

4117
02:02:38.280 --> 02:02:40.740
<v Speaker 3>And this is where the spread the risk comes in.</v>

4118
02:02:40.741 --> 02:02:45.540
<v Speaker 3>I think there's so many people talking about this stuff now that we're not in</v>

4119
02:02:45.541 --> 02:02:46.590
<v Speaker 3>the rusty days anymore.</v>

4120
02:02:48.090 --> 02:02:50.700
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of people who are talking about or writing about it.</v>

4121
02:02:51.060 --> 02:02:52.200
<v Speaker 3>It's all online.</v>

4122
02:02:52.540 --> 02:02:53.373
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4123
02:02:53.400 --> 02:02:55.110
<v Speaker 3>so that process has started.</v>

4124
02:02:55.111 --> 02:02:56.070
<v Speaker 3>So in that way,</v>

4125
02:02:56.100 --> 02:02:56.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4126
02:02:56.370 --> 02:02:57.540
<v Speaker 3>a little bit optimistic.</v>

4127
02:02:57.570 --> 02:03:01.050
<v Speaker 3>The fact that some honesty can really show pathak joe's shows you see them</v>

4128
02:03:01.051 --> 02:03:01.531
<v Speaker 3>everywhere.</v>

4129
02:03:01.531 --> 02:03:03.510
<v Speaker 3>He does public speeches,</v>

4130
02:03:03.511 --> 02:03:04.830
<v Speaker 3>he does debates,</v>

4131
02:03:04.860 --> 02:03:05.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4132
02:03:05.410 --> 02:03:08.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm wonder what is like if he does like the bill maher show when we're kind of</v>

4133
02:03:08.681 --> 02:03:09.730
<v Speaker 1>security they have.</v>

4134
02:03:10.120 --> 02:03:10.361
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4135
02:03:10.361 --> 02:03:10.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

4136
02:03:10.930 --> 02:03:11.763
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure.</v>

4137
02:03:11.950 --> 02:03:14.170
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't want to see it in person.</v>

4138
02:03:14.500 --> 02:03:14.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4139
02:03:14.860 --> 02:03:15.490
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>

4140
02:03:15.490 --> 02:03:17.620
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't want to be there the day it goes down.</v>

4141
02:03:19.390 --> 02:03:19.631
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4142
02:03:19.631 --> 02:03:20.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4143
02:03:20.010 --> 02:03:20.970
<v Speaker 3>ion hirsi ali,</v>

4144
02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:22.270
<v Speaker 3>she does travel to the orange.</v>

4145
02:03:22.570 --> 02:03:23.403
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4146
02:03:23.820 --> 02:03:24.960
<v Speaker 3>Does she know that?</v>

4147
02:03:24.961 --> 02:03:25.081
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4148
02:03:25.081 --> 02:03:26.250
<v Speaker 3>That's pretty well known.</v>

4149
02:03:26.460 --> 02:03:27.330
<v Speaker 3>So she still does,</v>

4150
02:03:28.380 --> 02:03:29.213
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4151
02:03:29.640 --> 02:03:30.080
<v Speaker 3>and it,</v>

4152
02:03:30.080 --> 02:03:30.390
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

4153
02:03:30.390 --> 02:03:30.900
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

4154
02:03:30.900 --> 02:03:35.790
<v Speaker 3>it's actually tougher for women who decide to change their mind about islam</v>

4155
02:03:36.810 --> 02:03:37.650
<v Speaker 3>because uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>it sucks,</v>

4167
02:03:54.480 --> 02:03:55.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4168
02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:56.280
<v Speaker 3>as you're going to go to hell or you know,</v>

4169
02:03:56.281 --> 02:03:57.600
<v Speaker 3>you should get your head chopped off,</v>

4170
02:03:57.640 --> 02:03:58.473
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is,</v>

4171
02:03:58.600 --> 02:03:58.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4172
02:03:58.770 --> 02:03:59.700
<v Speaker 3>they'll say things like that.</v>

4173
02:04:00.030 --> 02:04:00.870
<v Speaker 3>But with her,</v>

4174
02:04:01.590 --> 02:04:03.270
<v Speaker 3>it's always a sexual thing.</v>

4175
02:04:03.271 --> 02:04:03.571
<v Speaker 3>Like the,</v>

4176
02:04:03.571 --> 02:04:04.800
<v Speaker 3>the threats that you know,</v>

4177
02:04:04.980 --> 02:04:07.080
<v Speaker 3>she gets are rape threats,</v>

4178
02:04:07.110 --> 02:04:07.921
<v Speaker 3>rape threats,</v>

4179
02:04:07.921 --> 02:04:08.754
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4180
02:04:08.790 --> 02:04:13.410
<v Speaker 3>just all kinds of things that they would do and she'll get hundreds of them.</v>

4181
02:04:13.560 --> 02:04:14.210
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a lot.</v>

4182
02:04:14.210 --> 02:04:14.860
<v Speaker 3>Hundreds.</v>

4183
02:04:14.860 --> 02:04:15.151
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4184
02:04:15.151 --> 02:04:15.984
<v Speaker 3>Hundreds.</v>

4185
02:04:16.090 --> 02:04:16.360
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

4186
02:04:16.360 --> 02:04:16.680
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

4187
02:04:16.680 --> 02:04:17.980
<v Speaker 1>what do you do when you get those?</v>

4188
02:04:17.981 --> 02:04:19.750
<v Speaker 1>Do you report those to the fbi?</v>

4189
02:04:19.751 --> 02:04:20.200
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>

4190
02:04:20.200 --> 02:04:21.250
<v Speaker 1>do you save them?</v>

4191
02:04:21.251 --> 02:04:22.810
<v Speaker 1>Do you document them like,</v>

4192
02:04:22.900 --> 02:04:23.170
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4193
02:04:23.170 --> 02:04:25.000
<v Speaker 3>we saved them and we do.</v>

4194
02:04:25.001 --> 02:04:25.360
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4195
02:04:25.360 --> 02:04:27.880
<v Speaker 3>the hundreds that actuallY happened in one incident.</v>

4196
02:04:27.881 --> 02:04:28.210
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

4197
02:04:28.210 --> 02:04:28.531
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

4198
02:04:28.531 --> 02:04:33.531
<v Speaker 3>there's a politician in Pakistan who she knows personally and who has been sort</v>

4199
02:04:34.751 --> 02:04:39.751
<v Speaker 3>of a very vocal in his opposition to the taliban and she just said that she</v>

4200
02:04:40.111 --> 02:04:40.944
<v Speaker 3>supports him,</v>

4201
02:04:41.270 --> 02:04:41.580
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4202
02:04:41.580 --> 02:04:46.580
<v Speaker 3>And just because of that and because he is under a lot of threat targets and</v>

4203
02:04:46.891 --> 02:04:48.000
<v Speaker 3>then she had some argument,</v>

4204
02:04:48.070 --> 02:04:48.420
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>

4205
02:04:48.420 --> 02:04:51.250
<v Speaker 3>some of the people who oppose him and uh,</v>

4206
02:04:51.540 --> 02:04:55.320
<v Speaker 3>then the rape threats started coming in and so at that point,</v>

4207
02:04:55.321 --> 02:04:55.501
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4208
02:04:55.501 --> 02:04:56.340
<v Speaker 3>we would report it.</v>

4209
02:04:56.670 --> 02:04:58.440
<v Speaker 3>So we will report things like that.</v>

4210
02:04:58.640 --> 02:05:01.230
<v Speaker 3>I can't talk too much about what happened,</v>

4211
02:05:01.840 --> 02:05:02.673
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4212
02:05:03.250 --> 02:05:07.920
<v Speaker 3>but most of the time they come from overseas and some kids sitting in villages</v>

4213
02:05:07.921 --> 02:05:11.640
<v Speaker 3>and over the laptop or a cell phone and sending frets.</v>

4214
02:05:12.090 --> 02:05:12.511
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

4215
02:05:12.511 --> 02:05:12.780
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

4216
02:05:12.780 --> 02:05:13.021
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4217
02:05:13.021 --> 02:05:14.760
<v Speaker 3>there's always a chance to have one or two of them are real.</v>

4218
02:05:14.760 --> 02:05:16.200
<v Speaker 3>And this is obviously a real issue.</v>

4219
02:05:16.640 --> 02:05:17.473
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4220
02:05:17.850 --> 02:05:19.590
<v Speaker 3>but it is just generally,</v>

4221
02:05:19.591 --> 02:05:23.700
<v Speaker 3>it's a lot worse for women than it is for men because there's this idea,</v>

4222
02:05:23.701 --> 02:05:26.490
<v Speaker 3>especially among conservative cultures.</v>

4223
02:05:26.740 --> 02:05:27.330
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4224
02:05:27.330 --> 02:05:27.851
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

4225
02:05:27.851 --> 02:05:30.090
<v Speaker 3>a lot of the muslim culture is that,</v>

4226
02:05:30.140 --> 02:05:30.360
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4227
02:05:30.360 --> 02:05:31.180
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

4228
02:05:31.180 --> 02:05:31.460
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

4229
02:05:31.460 --> 02:05:34.560
<v Speaker 3>if a man decides not to follow religion,</v>

4230
02:05:35.100 --> 02:05:35.281
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4231
02:05:35.281 --> 02:05:36.120
<v Speaker 3>that's a separate thing,</v>

4232
02:05:36.121 --> 02:05:37.920
<v Speaker 3>but if a woman decides not to follow religion,</v>

4233
02:05:38.070 --> 02:05:39.240
<v Speaker 3>she's lost all morality.</v>

4234
02:05:40.590 --> 02:05:41.640
<v Speaker 3>So she'll do anything.</v>

4235
02:05:41.670 --> 02:05:42.361
<v Speaker 3>she'll drink,</v>

4236
02:05:42.361 --> 02:05:43.091
<v Speaker 3>she'll have sex.</v>

4237
02:05:43.091 --> 02:05:44.130
<v Speaker 3>You'll crazy bitch.</v>

4238
02:05:44.131 --> 02:05:44.461
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

4239
02:05:44.461 --> 02:05:44.551
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4240
02:05:44.551 --> 02:05:45.110
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

4241
02:05:45.110 --> 02:05:47.270
<v Speaker 3>Dare Sex.</v>

4242
02:05:47.680 --> 02:05:48.840
<v Speaker 3>Just trying to be like an american.</v>

4243
02:05:49.170 --> 02:05:49.890
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

4244
02:05:49.890 --> 02:05:51.630
<v Speaker 3>Because that's how they measure morality.</v>

4245
02:05:52.230 --> 02:05:53.640
<v Speaker 3>Like there is a lot of,</v>

4246
02:05:54.200 --> 02:05:57.720
<v Speaker 3>a lot of the people who killed people and they behead people and stuff.</v>

4247
02:05:57.770 --> 02:05:58.860
<v Speaker 3>They were really upset.</v>

4248
02:05:58.890 --> 02:06:00.360
<v Speaker 3>Like when they talk about morality,</v>

4249
02:06:00.361 --> 02:06:02.220
<v Speaker 3>like lapsed western morality,</v>

4250
02:06:02.221 --> 02:06:04.430
<v Speaker 3>they talk about chicks and miniskirts drinks,</v>

4251
02:06:04.431 --> 02:06:05.970
<v Speaker 3>sex and things like that.</v>

4252
02:06:06.150 --> 02:06:07.600
<v Speaker 3>Unbelievable while,</v>

4253
02:06:07.790 --> 02:06:08.140
<v Speaker 3>but they,</v>

4254
02:06:08.140 --> 02:06:11.910
<v Speaker 3>they don't think of the murder and the martyrdom and all those things are</v>

4255
02:06:11.911 --> 02:06:12.600
<v Speaker 3>virtuous.</v>

4256
02:06:12.600 --> 02:06:14.280
<v Speaker 3>They actually think that those things are good.</v>

4257
02:06:15.040 --> 02:06:15.800
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

4258
02:06:15.800 --> 02:06:16.633
<v Speaker 4>backwards.</v>

4259
02:06:16.670 --> 02:06:17.503
<v Speaker 4>it's so,</v>

4260
02:06:18.710 --> 02:06:19.543
<v Speaker 4>it's so,</v>

4261
02:06:19.640 --> 02:06:19.911
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4262
02:06:19.911 --> 02:06:20.721
<v Speaker 4>the word archaic,</v>

4263
02:06:20.721 --> 02:06:21.441
<v Speaker 4>I keep using it,</v>

4264
02:06:21.441 --> 02:06:22.910
<v Speaker 4>but that really is the word.</v>

4265
02:06:22.911 --> 02:06:23.171
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

4266
02:06:23.171 --> 02:06:26.540
<v Speaker 4>it's such an ancient version of thinking and this,</v>

4267
02:06:26.541 --> 02:06:29.630
<v Speaker 4>it's almost like an operating system that's so outdated.</v>

4268
02:06:29.631 --> 02:06:31.400
<v Speaker 4>Like you're trying to fuck with das.</v>

4269
02:06:31.850 --> 02:06:32.750
<v Speaker 4>Like you're trying to like,</v>

4270
02:06:32.780 --> 02:06:33.501
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>

4271
02:06:33.501 --> 02:06:34.820
<v Speaker 4>You're trying to like get on twitter,</v>

4272
02:06:34.821 --> 02:06:36.110
<v Speaker 4>but you're only using dos.</v>

4273
02:06:36.470 --> 02:06:41.470
<v Speaker 4>It's like god damn the operating system of fundamental religion is so fucking</v>

4274
02:06:42.561 --> 02:06:43.394
<v Speaker 4>broken.</v>

4275
02:06:43.450 --> 02:06:46.680
<v Speaker 3>I know and a lot of times they think that they have the updated software.</v>

4276
02:06:46.940 --> 02:06:47.773
<v Speaker 3>We have the most,</v>

4277
02:06:47.910 --> 02:06:49.350
<v Speaker 3>we have the most recent relIgion,</v>

4278
02:06:49.920 --> 02:06:54.510
<v Speaker 3>like islam came after christianity came to after that we had this great</v>

4279
02:06:54.511 --> 02:06:55.344
<v Speaker 3>civilization.</v>

4280
02:06:55.680 --> 02:07:00.680
<v Speaker 3>So and in which they did at one point and why are we in such bad shape?</v>

4281
02:07:02.810 --> 02:07:03.700
<v Speaker 4>I watched the world,</v>

4282
02:07:05.390 --> 02:07:05.691
<v Speaker 4>sorry,</v>

4283
02:07:05.691 --> 02:07:08.750
<v Speaker 4>watch the speech once where this guy was talking about,</v>

4284
02:07:09.400 --> 02:07:11.060
<v Speaker 4>he was asking questions or the,</v>

4285
02:07:11.061 --> 02:07:15.050
<v Speaker 4>the audience was asking questions about a certain aspects of islam and how do</v>

4286
02:07:15.051 --> 02:07:16.490
<v Speaker 4>they know whether,</v>

4287
02:07:16.520 --> 02:07:17.300
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4288
02:07:17.300 --> 02:07:20.360
<v Speaker 4>if one religion says one thing but islam says another.</v>

4289
02:07:20.900 --> 02:07:24.830
<v Speaker 4>And his answer was it's very simple because islam is the truth and everybody</v>

4290
02:07:24.831 --> 02:07:25.491
<v Speaker 4>starts clapping.</v>

4291
02:07:25.491 --> 02:07:25.731
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

4292
02:07:25.731 --> 02:07:26.564
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

4293
02:07:27.170 --> 02:07:28.003
<v Speaker 4>that's a,</v>

4294
02:07:29.090 --> 02:07:29.780
<v Speaker 4>that's a,</v>

4295
02:07:29.780 --> 02:07:31.010
<v Speaker 4>that's hilarious.</v>

4296
02:07:31.400 --> 02:07:34.300
<v Speaker 4>It's hilarious that somebody should look into is ah,</v>

4297
02:07:34.910 --> 02:07:35.080
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

4298
02:07:35.080 --> 02:07:35.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4299
02:07:35.260 --> 02:07:35.630
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

4300
02:07:35.630 --> 02:07:36.110
<v Speaker 3>there</v>

4301
02:07:36.110 --> 02:07:37.240
<v Speaker 4>is precedent for this.</v>

4302
02:07:37.241 --> 02:07:37.381
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

4303
02:07:37.381 --> 02:07:37.590
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4304
02:07:37.590 --> 02:07:40.510
<v Speaker 4>like we were talking about the holy books around here and the holy books are</v>

4305
02:07:40.511 --> 02:07:41.344
<v Speaker 4>very similar.</v>

4306
02:07:41.480 --> 02:07:46.480
<v Speaker 4>A lot of the stuff is like in the old testament actually mentioned stoning to</v>

4307
02:07:47.140 --> 02:07:47.620
<v Speaker 4>death.</v>

4308
02:07:47.620 --> 02:07:48.850
<v Speaker 4>The crown doesn't even mention it.</v>

4309
02:07:49.330 --> 02:07:50.330
<v Speaker 4>It's in the [inaudible],</v>

4310
02:07:50.350 --> 02:07:51.130
<v Speaker 4>which is a separate,</v>

4311
02:07:51.130 --> 02:07:55.000
<v Speaker 4>sort of like a lesser god source of guidance and islam.</v>

4312
02:07:55.390 --> 02:08:00.390
<v Speaker 4>And so there's many things that are in all of the scriptures that are pretty</v>

4313
02:08:01.091 --> 02:08:01.924
<v Speaker 4>important.</v>

4314
02:08:02.230 --> 02:08:04.210
<v Speaker 4>But how is it that,</v>

4315
02:08:04.530 --> 02:08:04.840
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4316
02:08:04.840 --> 02:08:07.600
<v Speaker 4>jews and christians were able to move past it.</v>

4317
02:08:07.840 --> 02:08:08.081
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4318
02:08:08.081 --> 02:08:09.400
<v Speaker 4>they had their dark ages too.</v>

4319
02:08:09.401 --> 02:08:11.740
<v Speaker 4>They did some really fucked up shit at one point.</v>

4320
02:08:12.090 --> 02:08:12.700
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4321
02:08:12.700 --> 02:08:14.530
<v Speaker 4>but they moved past that and they're here now.</v>

4322
02:08:14.660 --> 02:08:15.670
<v Speaker 4>What is the answer to that?</v>

4323
02:08:16.990 --> 02:08:17.823
<v Speaker 4>I think the,</v>

4324
02:08:18.080 --> 02:08:22.210
<v Speaker 4>and this is one of the things I'm exploring my book and I think,</v>

4325
02:08:22.211 --> 02:08:23.044
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4326
02:08:23.120 --> 02:08:23.953
<v Speaker 4>like with,</v>

4327
02:08:24.660 --> 02:08:25.070
<v Speaker 4>with,</v>

4328
02:08:25.070 --> 02:08:26.560
<v Speaker 4>with jews and with christians,</v>

4329
02:08:26.830 --> 02:08:31.090
<v Speaker 4>that they were able to have a genuine reformation where they're able to bond and</v>

4330
02:08:31.091 --> 02:08:34.870
<v Speaker 4>come together on a sense of community rather than ideology.</v>

4331
02:08:35.320 --> 02:08:35.501
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

4332
02:08:35.501 --> 02:08:35.651
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4333
02:08:35.651 --> 02:08:35.980
<v Speaker 4>if you're,</v>

4334
02:08:35.980 --> 02:08:36.820
<v Speaker 4>if you're jewish,</v>

4335
02:08:37.510 --> 02:08:38.570
<v Speaker 4>you can be an atheist jew,</v>

4336
02:08:38.571 --> 02:08:39.640
<v Speaker 4>you can be an agnostic jew,</v>

4337
02:08:39.641 --> 02:08:40.630
<v Speaker 4>you can be a secular jew,</v>

4338
02:08:40.930 --> 02:08:41.860
<v Speaker 4>you can be an orthodox jew,</v>

4339
02:08:41.861 --> 02:08:43.150
<v Speaker 4>but nobody's ever going to say,</v>

4340
02:08:43.151 --> 02:08:43.301
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

4341
02:08:43.301 --> 02:08:44.350
<v Speaker 4>you're not a junior anymore,</v>

4342
02:08:44.440 --> 02:08:45.273
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4343
02:08:45.370 --> 02:08:45.971
<v Speaker 4>You did this,</v>

4344
02:08:45.971 --> 02:08:47.440
<v Speaker 4>you eat bacon or whatever.</v>

4345
02:08:47.660 --> 02:08:48.493
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4346
02:08:48.550 --> 02:08:49.383
<v Speaker 4>with christians,</v>

4347
02:08:49.420 --> 02:08:49.631
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

4348
02:08:49.631 --> 02:08:50.560
<v Speaker 4>we were taLking about the catholic,</v>

4349
02:08:50.570 --> 02:08:51.130
<v Speaker 4>sorry,</v>

4350
02:08:51.130 --> 02:08:51.280
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4351
02:08:51.280 --> 02:08:51.551
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

4352
02:08:51.551 --> 02:08:52.384
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4353
02:08:52.540 --> 02:08:53.650
<v Speaker 4>a lot of them pro choice,</v>

4354
02:08:53.680 --> 02:08:53.940
<v Speaker 4>they'll,</v>

4355
02:08:53.940 --> 02:08:56.200
<v Speaker 4>they'll that they'll still end up going to church.</v>

4356
02:08:56.230 --> 02:08:57.760
<v Speaker 4>But you can't be an atheist christian.</v>

4357
02:08:58.860 --> 02:09:00.880
<v Speaker 4>You technically can't be an atheist christian.</v>

4358
02:09:01.120 --> 02:09:02.930
<v Speaker 4>Not even technically if you,</v>

4359
02:09:03.110 --> 02:09:05.080
<v Speaker 4>if you tell christians that you're an atheist,</v>

4360
02:09:05.081 --> 02:09:06.930
<v Speaker 4>they'll look at you like you just shit on a plate.</v>

4361
02:09:07.650 --> 02:09:08.261
<v Speaker 4>Mean they,</v>

4362
02:09:08.261 --> 02:09:12.190
<v Speaker 4>they are not interested in hearing that there's a strong faction of</v>

4363
02:09:12.191 --> 02:09:13.030
<v Speaker 4>christianity,</v>

4364
02:09:13.300 --> 02:09:15.440
<v Speaker 4>fundamentalist faction of christianity that it,</v>

4365
02:09:15.640 --> 02:09:20.590
<v Speaker 4>they were incredibly upset at the word atheist or atheist.</v>

4366
02:09:20.780 --> 02:09:21.613
<v Speaker 4>It's a very bad.</v>

4367
02:09:21.780 --> 02:09:24.620
<v Speaker 3>I mean they actually think of atheists this worse than rapists.</v>

4368
02:09:24.640 --> 02:09:29.640
<v Speaker 3>I think I was reading that they had added a data survey on how many or who you</v>

4369
02:09:30.741 --> 02:09:31.311
<v Speaker 3>despise.</v>

4370
02:09:31.311 --> 02:09:33.790
<v Speaker 3>Most people actually think atheists are worse.</v>

4371
02:09:33.800 --> 02:09:34.633
<v Speaker 3>Worsened rapist.</v>

4372
02:09:34.730 --> 02:09:35.780
<v Speaker 3>So you have.</v>

4373
02:09:35.840 --> 02:09:36.651
<v Speaker 3>But at the same time,</v>

4374
02:09:36.651 --> 02:09:37.484
<v Speaker 3>you don't get,</v>

4375
02:09:38.570 --> 02:09:39.480
<v Speaker 3>you don't get murdered,</v>

4376
02:09:39.481 --> 02:09:40.290
<v Speaker 3>so you don't get murdered.</v>

4377
02:09:40.290 --> 02:09:43.460
<v Speaker 3>You don't even get excommunicated from the community as you used condoms.</v>

4378
02:09:43.520 --> 02:09:44.900
<v Speaker 3>Like no one's going to say,</v>

4379
02:09:44.901 --> 02:09:45.420
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

4380
02:09:45.420 --> 02:09:46.460
<v Speaker 3>you use birth control,</v>

4381
02:09:46.461 --> 02:09:48.080
<v Speaker 3>so you're not a catholic anymore.</v>

4382
02:09:48.140 --> 02:09:50.060
<v Speaker 3>But with islam,</v>

4383
02:09:50.090 --> 02:09:50.990
<v Speaker 3>it's still,</v>

4384
02:09:51.620 --> 02:09:53.540
<v Speaker 3>a lot of muslims are still in that.</v>

4385
02:09:53.541 --> 02:09:55.070
<v Speaker 3>you can sit 10 people down.</v>

4386
02:09:55.071 --> 02:09:56.400
<v Speaker 3>One of them's gonna say music's ascend,</v>

4387
02:09:56.540 --> 02:09:58.190
<v Speaker 3>another one's going to say you got to cover your head,</v>

4388
02:09:58.550 --> 02:09:59.090
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4389
02:09:59.090 --> 02:10:02.330
<v Speaker 3>and you'll have all these different viewpoints and they'll,</v>

4390
02:10:02.660 --> 02:10:04.460
<v Speaker 3>there's going to be fragmentation based on that.</v>

4391
02:10:04.850 --> 02:10:06.590
<v Speaker 3>But if they are able to come around,</v>

4392
02:10:06.850 --> 02:10:07.200
<v Speaker 3>if they,</v>

4393
02:10:07.200 --> 02:10:08.840
<v Speaker 3>if they're able to focus instead on,</v>

4394
02:10:08.890 --> 02:10:11.450
<v Speaker 3>instead of the ideology focused on the community,</v>

4395
02:10:11.540 --> 02:10:11.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4396
02:10:11.810 --> 02:10:13.910
<v Speaker 3>we were saying that the identity of,</v>

4397
02:10:13.911 --> 02:10:14.091
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4398
02:10:14.091 --> 02:10:14.811
<v Speaker 3>going to church,</v>

4399
02:10:14.811 --> 02:10:14.991
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4400
02:10:14.991 --> 02:10:19.991
<v Speaker 3>having your own family and friends and that sort of communal atmosphere that a</v>

4401
02:10:21.350 --> 02:10:24.140
<v Speaker 3>religious belonging to a religious group gives you.</v>

4402
02:10:24.260 --> 02:10:25.190
<v Speaker 3>Which is a benefit</v>

4403
02:10:25.570 --> 02:10:26.381
<v Speaker 4>for a lot of people.</v>

4404
02:10:26.381 --> 02:10:26.880
<v Speaker 4>That mean that,</v>

4405
02:10:26.880 --> 02:10:31.880
<v Speaker 4>that sense of community is so huge for a comfort to people providing people with</v>

4406
02:10:33.080 --> 02:10:33.461
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

4407
02:10:33.461 --> 02:10:33.890
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4408
02:10:33.890 --> 02:10:38.890
<v Speaker 4>this group that they can rely upon and they feel connected to and joined with.</v>

4409
02:10:40.070 --> 02:10:41.540
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of benefit to them.</v>

4410
02:10:42.030 --> 02:10:47.030
<v Speaker 4>The idea that it has to be attached to some archaic belief system to some</v>

4411
02:10:47.511 --> 02:10:52.160
<v Speaker 4>ridiculous old shit that was written down when people had a very poor</v>

4412
02:10:52.161 --> 02:10:53.900
<v Speaker 4>understanding of reality,</v>

4413
02:10:54.170 --> 02:10:55.220
<v Speaker 4>very poor.</v>

4414
02:10:55.580 --> 02:10:56.390
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

4415
02:10:56.390 --> 02:11:01.390
<v Speaker 4>and that's what's really bizarre about the islamic religion is that at one point</v>

4416
02:11:01.761 --> 02:11:02.271
<v Speaker 4>in time,</v>

4417
02:11:02.271 --> 02:11:02.511
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4418
02:11:02.511 --> 02:11:03.344
<v Speaker 4>in the early,</v>

4419
02:11:03.630 --> 02:11:04.463
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4420
02:11:04.530 --> 02:11:09.530
<v Speaker 4>just like the 12 hundreds and before islam was at the forefront of science and</v>

4421
02:11:09.921 --> 02:11:11.900
<v Speaker 4>philosophy and writing.</v>

4422
02:11:12.140 --> 02:11:15.170
<v Speaker 4>I mean it was one of the islamic world.</v>

4423
02:11:15.171 --> 02:11:19.370
<v Speaker 4>The muslim world was one of the more advanced cultures on earth.</v>

4424
02:11:20.220 --> 02:11:21.500
<v Speaker 3>And it wasn't really an,</v>

4425
02:11:21.520 --> 02:11:21.871
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

4426
02:11:21.871 --> 02:11:22.520
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

4427
02:11:22.520 --> 02:11:25.020
<v Speaker 3>this is where we make that distinction between islam,</v>

4428
02:11:25.021 --> 02:11:27.480
<v Speaker 3>the religion and the muslims followed it.</v>

4429
02:11:27.481 --> 02:11:29.730
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of this was done by the matassa lights,</v>

4430
02:11:29.731 --> 02:11:32.190
<v Speaker 3>which is very sort of a openminded.</v>

4431
02:11:32.540 --> 02:11:36.420
<v Speaker 3>I'm very progressive sect of muslims,</v>

4432
02:11:36.710 --> 02:11:37.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4433
02:11:37.230 --> 02:11:42.230
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of those thiNgs happened not because of islam but despite it.</v>

4434
02:11:43.500 --> 02:11:44.340
<v Speaker 3>Even baCk then.</v>

4435
02:11:44.420 --> 02:11:44.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4436
02:11:44.620 --> 02:11:45.271
<v Speaker 3>Even back then,</v>

4437
02:11:45.271 --> 02:11:46.170
<v Speaker 3>it's always been like that.</v>

4438
02:11:46.171 --> 02:11:46.351
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4439
02:11:46.351 --> 02:11:49.580
<v Speaker 3>newton was a religious christian because you'd had the time.</v>

4440
02:11:49.590 --> 02:11:50.790
<v Speaker 3>It was like a virgin though too.</v>

4441
02:11:50.791 --> 02:11:51.870
<v Speaker 3>Wasn't even really weird.</v>

4442
02:11:52.150 --> 02:11:52.290
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

4443
02:11:52.290 --> 02:11:52.531
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

4444
02:11:52.531 --> 02:11:52.950
<v Speaker 3>he was a,</v>

4445
02:11:52.950 --> 02:11:53.730
<v Speaker 3>he was a virgin.</v>

4446
02:11:53.730 --> 02:11:55.640
<v Speaker 3>He didn't like,</v>

4447
02:11:56.340 --> 02:11:57.330
<v Speaker 3>there was no evolution.</v>

4448
02:11:57.331 --> 02:11:58.680
<v Speaker 3>Like nobody knew about evolution.</v>

4449
02:11:58.681 --> 02:12:00.030
<v Speaker 3>It was pre darwin and everything.</v>

4450
02:12:00.031 --> 02:12:02.790
<v Speaker 3>So this is a lot of things he didn't know if he had known,</v>

4451
02:12:02.791 --> 02:12:04.030
<v Speaker 3>he may not have been a,</v>

4452
02:12:04.230 --> 02:12:05.460
<v Speaker 3>we can't speculate on that,</v>

4453
02:12:05.461 --> 02:12:06.210
<v Speaker 3>but I mean he was,</v>

4454
02:12:06.210 --> 02:12:11.210
<v Speaker 3>he was a religious christian but we don't identify his achievements as christian</v>

4455
02:12:11.731 --> 02:12:12.564
<v Speaker 3>achievements.</v>

4456
02:12:13.260 --> 02:12:14.340
<v Speaker 3>We don't identify.</v>

4457
02:12:14.440 --> 02:12:18.990
<v Speaker 3>I'm like albert einstein's achievements as somethinG at the stewart and he</v>

4458
02:12:18.991 --> 02:12:20.410
<v Speaker 3>wasn't even albert einstein.</v>

4459
02:12:20.411 --> 02:12:21.300
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't even reliGious.</v>

4460
02:12:21.690 --> 02:12:22.200
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

4461
02:12:22.200 --> 02:12:23.033
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4462
02:12:23.400 --> 02:12:24.400
<v Speaker 3>but so with this,</v>

4463
02:12:24.450 --> 02:12:27.390
<v Speaker 3>the fact that there were muslims in a certain part of the world that we're</v>

4464
02:12:27.391 --> 02:12:28.550
<v Speaker 3>engaging in,</v>

4465
02:12:28.900 --> 02:12:29.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4466
02:12:29.560 --> 02:12:33.390
<v Speaker 3>a lot of scientific inquiry and they were really moving forward and there were</v>

4467
02:12:33.391 --> 02:12:35.610
<v Speaker 3>being progressive and they're making new discoveries.</v>

4468
02:12:36.460 --> 02:12:39.900
<v Speaker 3>Know this is something that is more of a,</v>

4469
02:12:40.290 --> 02:12:45.290
<v Speaker 3>it's a more of a testament to science and to free thinking than it is to the</v>

4470
02:12:46.351 --> 02:12:47.190
<v Speaker 3>religion itself.</v>

4471
02:12:47.520 --> 02:12:51.580
<v Speaker 3>They just seem to be muslims that's similar to the fact that</v>

4472
02:12:51.620 --> 02:12:52.221
<v Speaker 4>darwin,</v>

4473
02:12:52.221 --> 02:12:56.020
<v Speaker 4>when he was proposing use theories that predominant scientific community was</v>

4474
02:12:56.030 --> 02:13:01.030
<v Speaker 4>christian [inaudible] most of the people that he told his ideas to were in</v>

4475
02:13:01.131 --> 02:13:06.131
<v Speaker 4>opposition of these ideas initially because it went opposite of their christian</v>

4476
02:13:06.231 --> 02:13:06.770
<v Speaker 4>beliefs.</v>

4477
02:13:06.770 --> 02:13:06.940
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

4478
02:13:06.940 --> 02:13:07.490
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

4479
02:13:07.490 --> 02:13:12.490
<v Speaker 4>we think of scientists today as being almost universally secular or at least the</v>

4480
02:13:12.650 --> 02:13:15.320
<v Speaker 4>ones that we pay attention to and respect.</v>

4481
02:13:15.321 --> 02:13:20.150
<v Speaker 4>We think of them as having at the very least an agnostic religious base.</v>

4482
02:13:20.390 --> 02:13:22.550
<v Speaker 4>But back then there were predominantly</v>

4483
02:13:22.550 --> 02:13:23.350
<v Speaker 3>christian.</v>

4484
02:13:23.350 --> 02:13:23.561
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4485
02:13:23.561 --> 02:13:24.160
<v Speaker 3>a lot of them.</v>

4486
02:13:24.160 --> 02:13:27.730
<v Speaker 3>They were in America and everywhere.</v>

4487
02:13:27.940 --> 02:13:32.940
<v Speaker 3>And I think what we do is we sometimes Look at it other way around when you</v>

4488
02:13:33.481 --> 02:13:33.781
<v Speaker 3>have,</v>

4489
02:13:33.781 --> 02:13:35.670
<v Speaker 3>when you had all that scientific progress happening,</v>

4490
02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:36.833
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4491
02:13:36.900 --> 02:13:40.080
<v Speaker 3>in the sort of the golden age of muslims.</v>

4492
02:13:40.430 --> 02:13:41.263
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4493
02:13:41.700 --> 02:13:43.440
<v Speaker 3>then that was happening again,</v>

4494
02:13:43.441 --> 02:13:45.900
<v Speaker 3>like it was happening despite the fact that it was islam.</v>

4495
02:13:46.230 --> 02:13:47.700
<v Speaker 3>Now when you have all of these,</v>

4496
02:13:47.730 --> 02:13:48.000
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4497
02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:48.833
<v Speaker 3>all the terrorism,</v>

4498
02:13:49.110 --> 02:13:50.160
<v Speaker 3>all these things happening,</v>

4499
02:13:50.161 --> 02:13:54.960
<v Speaker 3>there's a direct relationship between words in the scripture and what they're</v>

4500
02:13:54.961 --> 02:13:55.710
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>

4501
02:13:55.710 --> 02:13:57.330
<v Speaker 3>So what we do is now we say,</v>

4502
02:13:57.331 --> 02:13:57.840
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

4503
02:13:57.840 --> 02:13:59.010
<v Speaker 3>just because they're muslims,</v>

4504
02:13:59.490 --> 02:14:00.660
<v Speaker 3>they just happened to be muslim.</v>

4505
02:14:00.661 --> 02:14:01.494
<v Speaker 3>That's why they're doing it.</v>

4506
02:14:01.740 --> 02:14:04.680
<v Speaker 3>But at that time we actually attributed to islam when it's really the other way</v>

4507
02:14:04.681 --> 02:14:05.514
<v Speaker 3>around.</v>

4508
02:14:06.300 --> 02:14:07.020
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

4509
02:14:07.020 --> 02:14:07.770
<v Speaker 3>That makes sense.</v>

4510
02:14:07.770 --> 02:14:08.290
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a,</v>

4511
02:14:08.290 --> 02:14:11.210
<v Speaker 3>there isn't anything in the quran that had been.</v>

4512
02:14:11.370 --> 02:14:13.200
<v Speaker 3>The crown says strange things,</v>

4513
02:14:13.201 --> 02:14:17.340
<v Speaker 3>just like any other holy scripture in [inaudible] 86,</v>

4514
02:14:17.870 --> 02:14:18.120
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4515
02:14:18.120 --> 02:14:19.230
<v Speaker 3>Verses five to seven,</v>

4516
02:14:19.231 --> 02:14:24.231
<v Speaker 3>it says that a man was created from a fluid ejected between the backbone and the</v>

4517
02:14:24.781 --> 02:14:25.560
<v Speaker 3>ribs.</v>

4518
02:14:25.560 --> 02:14:29.460
<v Speaker 3>So essentially it's saying that semen or sperm was created in the chest.</v>

4519
02:14:29.790 --> 02:14:30.061
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4520
02:14:30.061 --> 02:14:32.220
<v Speaker 3>this is like a backbone and the ribs,</v>

4521
02:14:32.280 --> 02:14:33.570
<v Speaker 3>the backbone and the ribs.</v>

4522
02:14:33.990 --> 02:14:37.780
<v Speaker 3>So 86 feeling the belly rent could be looking at this room.</v>

4523
02:14:38.320 --> 02:14:38.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4524
02:14:38.480 --> 02:14:40.020
<v Speaker 3>I mean you can broaden it and you can,</v>

4525
02:14:40.050 --> 02:14:41.670
<v Speaker 3>you can try to just select where your liver,</v>

4526
02:14:41.760 --> 02:14:44.850
<v Speaker 3>the lower lower ribs if you think so.</v>

4527
02:14:45.250 --> 02:14:46.020
<v Speaker 3>That could be.</v>

4528
02:14:46.020 --> 02:14:47.390
<v Speaker 3>I think it's just the testes man.</v>

4529
02:14:47.550 --> 02:14:48.383
<v Speaker 3>It couldn't be,</v>

4530
02:14:48.750 --> 02:14:52.410
<v Speaker 3>so that seems like a pretty vague the ribs.</v>

4531
02:14:52.470 --> 02:14:52.771
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

4532
02:14:52.771 --> 02:14:52.981
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

4533
02:14:52.981 --> 02:14:54.930
<v Speaker 3>it's like saying chicago is in the western hemisphere,</v>

4534
02:14:55.320 --> 02:14:59.020
<v Speaker 3>but you miss the western hemisphere because this is really a,</v>

4535
02:14:59.021 --> 02:14:59.854
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4536
02:15:00.030 --> 02:15:02.820
<v Speaker 3>there's absolutely no scientific basis to that whatsoever.</v>

4537
02:15:02.890 --> 02:15:03.780
<v Speaker 3>Just flat out wrong.</v>

4538
02:15:04.210 --> 02:15:05.043
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4539
02:15:05.440 --> 02:15:06.360
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

4540
02:15:06.390 --> 02:15:07.223
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

4541
02:15:07.390 --> 02:15:10.710
<v Speaker 3>so it doesn't have any set that the koran doesn't necessarily.</v>

4542
02:15:10.860 --> 02:15:12.240
<v Speaker 3>It's not conducive to,</v>

4543
02:15:12.770 --> 02:15:13.081
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4544
02:15:13.081 --> 02:15:14.760
<v Speaker 3>robust scientific inquiry.</v>

4545
02:15:15.260 --> 02:15:15.870
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

4546
02:15:15.870 --> 02:15:18.210
<v Speaker 3>But it is unfortunately linked,</v>

4547
02:15:18.500 --> 02:15:18.680
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

4548
02:15:18.680 --> 02:15:18.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4549
02:15:18.870 --> 02:15:20.460
<v Speaker 3>the words of the current in the scripture,</v>

4550
02:15:20.461 --> 02:15:24.390
<v Speaker 3>it is linked to a lot of the violence that you see a lot of the subjugation of</v>

4551
02:15:24.391 --> 02:15:25.320
<v Speaker 3>women that you see.</v>

4552
02:15:26.820 --> 02:15:30.540
<v Speaker 3>And that connection is something that should be acknowledged.</v>

4553
02:15:30.570 --> 02:15:31.800
<v Speaker 3>That's islamophobic.</v>

4554
02:15:31.920 --> 02:15:32.753
<v Speaker 3>How dare you.</v>

4555
02:15:32.910 --> 02:15:33.390
<v Speaker 3>There you go.</v>

4556
02:15:33.390 --> 02:15:34.290
<v Speaker 3>I'm a racist.</v>

4557
02:15:34.440 --> 02:15:34.921
<v Speaker 3>You are,</v>

4558
02:15:34.921 --> 02:15:36.510
<v Speaker 3>you're a racist against yourself.</v>

4559
02:15:36.930 --> 02:15:37.711
<v Speaker 3>You son of a,</v>

4560
02:15:37.711 --> 02:15:38.200
<v Speaker 3>b.</v>

4561
02:15:38.200 --> 02:15:40.000
<v Speaker 3>How and racist racist.</v>

4562
02:15:40.001 --> 02:15:41.610
<v Speaker 3>Just like gross as well.</v>

4563
02:15:41.670 --> 02:15:41.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4564
02:15:41.910 --> 02:15:43.110
<v Speaker 3>I've been athletic.</v>

4565
02:15:43.320 --> 02:15:44.160
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

4566
02:15:44.161 --> 02:15:44.850
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>

4567
02:15:44.850 --> 02:15:46.050
<v Speaker 3>He was a silly boy.</v>

4568
02:15:46.860 --> 02:15:47.281
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4569
02:15:47.281 --> 02:15:49.020
<v Speaker 3>That ben affleck thing was pretty weird.</v>

4570
02:15:49.021 --> 02:15:49.380
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

4571
02:15:49.380 --> 02:15:50.160
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>

4572
02:15:50.160 --> 02:15:54.600
<v Speaker 3>I think he was just trying to get brownie points though that on that show.</v>

4573
02:15:54.601 --> 02:15:56.130
<v Speaker 3>like the fact that that happened.</v>

4574
02:15:56.200 --> 02:15:56.530
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

4575
02:15:56.530 --> 02:15:59.160
<v Speaker 3>there was such outrage everywhere,</v>

4576
02:16:00.200 --> 02:16:03.280
<v Speaker 3>like I've just noticed that when someone says something like that or if there's</v>

4577
02:16:03.300 --> 02:16:04.840
<v Speaker 3>a curtain Burned or cartoons drawn,</v>

4578
02:16:04.860 --> 02:16:06.420
<v Speaker 3>this is like a lot of outrage,</v>

4579
02:16:06.480 --> 02:16:11.480
<v Speaker 3>but it just not the kind of thing you see when people burn people alive or</v>

4580
02:16:11.721 --> 02:16:12.554
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

4581
02:16:12.570 --> 02:16:17.570
<v Speaker 3>Then you get hashtags and when boko haram like bulk around killing 2000 people,</v>

4582
02:16:18.750 --> 02:16:20.060
<v Speaker 3>kidnapping all those school girls,</v>

4583
02:16:20.980 --> 02:16:22.200
<v Speaker 3>you get to hashtags and things.</v>

4584
02:16:22.201 --> 02:16:24.960
<v Speaker 3>You don't get the kind of outcry that you get over cartoons.</v>

4585
02:16:25.740 --> 02:16:26.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4586
02:16:26.340 --> 02:16:26.731
<v Speaker 3>That will.</v>

4587
02:16:26.731 --> 02:16:28.480
<v Speaker 3>That was in africa too and you know,</v>

4588
02:16:28.530 --> 02:16:30.970
<v Speaker 3>we have a of this going on over there.</v>

4589
02:16:31.200 --> 02:16:31.380
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4590
02:16:31.380 --> 02:16:32.213
<v Speaker 3>like dark floor.</v>

4591
02:16:32.280 --> 02:16:35.530
<v Speaker 3>It's like 500,000 people killed by an arab,</v>

4592
02:16:35.531 --> 02:16:36.041
<v Speaker 3>the ga.</v>

4593
02:16:36.041 --> 02:16:39.880
<v Speaker 3>We'd militia and we could go on and on and on forever,</v>

4594
02:16:39.881 --> 02:16:40.390
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4595
02:16:40.390 --> 02:16:40.811
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4596
02:16:40.811 --> 02:16:41.340
<v Speaker 3>we could.</v>

4597
02:16:41.340 --> 02:16:42.173
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4598
02:16:42.430 --> 02:16:43.263
<v Speaker 3>Let's see.</v>

4599
02:16:43.440 --> 02:16:44.710
<v Speaker 3>Before I get too depressed,</v>

4600
02:16:44.770 --> 02:16:45.603
<v Speaker 3>let's end this.</v>

4601
02:16:45.640 --> 02:16:46.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4602
02:16:46.150 --> 02:16:48.670
<v Speaker 3>When will your book be available?</v>

4603
02:16:49.110 --> 02:16:49.381
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4604
02:16:49.381 --> 02:16:53.400
<v Speaker 3>I'm still working on it right now where I'm in the middle of sort of like</v>

4605
02:16:53.410 --> 02:16:54.243
<v Speaker 3>negotiating,</v>

4606
02:16:54.400 --> 02:16:55.720
<v Speaker 3>like talking to publishers.</v>

4607
02:16:56.080 --> 02:16:57.460
<v Speaker 3>So it's still happening.</v>

4608
02:16:57.461 --> 02:16:58.060
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>

4609
02:16:58.060 --> 02:17:00.190
<v Speaker 3>there's more interest in it than I thought there would be.</v>

4610
02:17:00.670 --> 02:17:02.380
<v Speaker 3>So it's a good thing.</v>

4616
02:17:06.970 --> 02:17:11.260
<v Speaker 3>I would say about a year that's like my personal goal will let me know when it's</v>
