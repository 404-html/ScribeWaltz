<v Speaker 1>you haven't seen this.</v>

7
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.090
<v Speaker 1>So University of Michigan,</v>

8
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.650
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of universities.</v>

9
00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:14.200
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

10
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.180
<v Speaker 1>Now doing this,</v>

11
00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

12
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:15.811
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

13
00:00:15.811 --> 00:00:17.070
<v Speaker 1>like you sign up for class,</v>

14
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.460
<v Speaker 1>your professor sends out an email to the entire class and professor Joe Rogan,</v>

15
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.530
<v Speaker 1>my preferred pronouns are he him.</v>

16
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.970
<v Speaker 1>And then this one kid was able to cause you can voluntary choose your pronoun.</v>

17
00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.240
<v Speaker 1>He was like minus his majesty of it.</v>

18
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:34.463
<v Speaker 1>What a good kid.</v>

19
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.800
<v Speaker 1>His whole thing was to a point out the absurdity of it,</v>

20
00:00:37.801 --> 00:00:38.634
<v Speaker 1>but then people are like,</v>

21
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.230
<v Speaker 1>you're a fucking asshole.</v>

22
00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.180
<v Speaker 1>Like they're all mad at him.</v>

23
00:00:42.181 --> 00:00:44.070
<v Speaker 1>Now his name is grant Strobel.</v>

24
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.670
<v Speaker 1>Chairman of the young Americans Foundation do use the new policy to update his</v>

25
00:00:47.671 --> 00:00:49.470
<v Speaker 1>preferred Pronoun to His Majesty.</v>

26
00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.060
<v Speaker 1>How could they be mad at him?</v>

27
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.690
<v Speaker 1>That is,</v>

28
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.460
<v Speaker 1>that is no more ridiculous than h.</v>

29
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:53.671
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

30
00:00:53.671 --> 00:00:58.410
<v Speaker 1>R of course there's like 18 different gender pronouns now we've been identified</v>

31
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.050
<v Speaker 1>and we also know there's astral gendered.</v>

32
00:01:01.051 --> 00:01:04.310
<v Speaker 1>If you're feeling like you're part of the cosmos or eat Polly,</v>

33
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm Pauline by.</v>

34
00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:06.553
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

35
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.960
<v Speaker 1>you put it on your,</v>

36
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.420
<v Speaker 1>your pot.</v>

37
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.050
<v Speaker 1>You put it on his podcast or he's a Twitter page like a,</v>

38
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.990
<v Speaker 1>it was like by awareness day and then,</v>

39
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:17.010
<v Speaker 1>and then some,</v>

40
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.083
<v Speaker 1>some guy,</v>

41
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.900
<v Speaker 1>a real professor was tweeting and he retweeted.</v>

42
00:01:21.901 --> 00:01:24.930
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't something that was so close to parity.</v>

43
00:01:24.931 --> 00:01:25.830
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck did he say?</v>

44
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:26.910
<v Speaker 1>He was just like,</v>

45
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.780
<v Speaker 1>it was the wording of it was too absurd to even recall.</v>

46
00:01:30.781 --> 00:01:31.614
<v Speaker 1>But it was like,</v>

47
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.440
<v Speaker 1>remember when you're the teacher today on,</v>

48
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.323
<v Speaker 1>on um,</v>

49
00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.860
<v Speaker 1>by awareness day,</v>

50
00:01:37.861 --> 00:01:42.861
<v Speaker 1>your gender and your to be by is not to be gender specific,</v>

51
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.920
<v Speaker 1>but your specific to city of your gender can also dictate what your sexuality</v>

52
00:01:49.291 --> 00:01:50.040
<v Speaker 1>might be like.</v>

53
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.550
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

54
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:51.420
<v Speaker 1>like something like that.</v>

55
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.283
<v Speaker 1>Something,</v>

56
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.933
<v Speaker 1>I dunno.</v>

57
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.400
<v Speaker 1>And then it was like happy by awareness.</v>

58
00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.481
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

59
00:01:57.481 --> 00:02:02.481
<v Speaker 1>I finally used an all gender restroom in Portland and it was at a gay bar and I</v>

60
00:02:03.391 --> 00:02:03.680
<v Speaker 1>got,</v>

61
00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.010
<v Speaker 1>I didn't enjoy it.</v>

62
00:02:05.011 --> 00:02:07.110
<v Speaker 1>And it's not because of the whole Pronoun thing.</v>

63
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.440
<v Speaker 1>It's because you've got like dude's taking gnarly shits next to you.</v>

64
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.363
<v Speaker 1>That's an issue.</v>

65
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.773
<v Speaker 1>I don't need it.</v>

66
00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:13.623
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

67
00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't need it zooms or is A's I'm and by,</v>

68
00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.100
<v Speaker 1>and I'm also fluid gender.</v>

69
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.430
<v Speaker 1>My favorite thing is to be fluid gender because you can go however you're</v>

70
00:02:26.041 --> 00:02:26.940
<v Speaker 1>feeling in the moment,</v>

71
00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.730
<v Speaker 1>but you have to,</v>

72
00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.610
<v Speaker 1>people have to know what to call you,</v>

73
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.510
<v Speaker 1>so you have to,</v>

74
00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:31.500
<v Speaker 1>that's my favorite.</v>

75
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.780
<v Speaker 1>Announce constantly that we want.</v>

76
00:02:33.781 --> 00:02:35.850
<v Speaker 1>We saw this video of this guy who was like,</v>

77
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.661
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>

78
00:02:36.661 --> 00:02:36.811
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

79
00:02:36.811 --> 00:02:38.550
<v Speaker 1>you should really respect people's pronouns,</v>

80
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:38.971
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

81
00:02:38.971 --> 00:02:39.540
<v Speaker 1>which I owe.</v>

82
00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.811
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

83
00:02:39.811 --> 00:02:40.590
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

84
00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.230
<v Speaker 1>Then he goes and if you see somebody and you're not sure,</v>

85
00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.320
<v Speaker 1>just ask them.</v>

86
00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.641
<v Speaker 1>Be like,</v>

87
00:02:44.641 --> 00:02:45.060
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

88
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.893
<v Speaker 1>what's your pronoun?</v>

89
00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:46.860
<v Speaker 1>To which I say,</v>

90
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.251
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

91
00:02:47.251 --> 00:02:48.084
<v Speaker 1>you fucking don't.</v>

92
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.750
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

93
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.280
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to just see somebody and be like,</v>

94
00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.890
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

95
00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:51.080
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

96
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.913
<v Speaker 1>I'm just wondering.</v>

97
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:53.383
<v Speaker 1>She pronouns.</v>

98
00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.440
<v Speaker 1>I think that the elders should be on the person.</v>

99
00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:56.780
<v Speaker 1>The Steven Crowder.</v>

100
00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.120
<v Speaker 1>Steven Crowder has a fucking hilarious video where he actually does this and</v>

101
00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.510
<v Speaker 1>he'll go,</v>

102
00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.721
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

103
00:03:01.721 --> 00:03:05.380
<v Speaker 1>he goes out and asks people what their preferred gender pronouns are.</v>

104
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:06.240
<v Speaker 1>And they,</v>

105
00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.090
<v Speaker 1>there's the,</v>

106
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.380
<v Speaker 1>the looks they give him,</v>

107
00:03:08.381 --> 00:03:11.500
<v Speaker 1>like he goes to like grown adults and it goes up to them on the street and just</v>

108
00:03:11.501 --> 00:03:14.320
<v Speaker 1>talks to them and just wonders what their preferred gender Pronoun is.</v>

109
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.090
<v Speaker 1>Nobody knows what the fuck you're talking about.</v>

110
00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:17.110
<v Speaker 1>Preposterous.</v>

111
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.640
<v Speaker 1>I can't wait for the backlash is what's that video of that Guy Dustin?</v>

112
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.750

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

115
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:25.930
<v Speaker 1>We'd have to show Joe that one.</v>

116
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:27.190
<v Speaker 1>Dakota is amazing.</v>

117
00:03:27.191 --> 00:03:28.990

118

<v Speaker 1>Oh for the,</v>

122
00:03:35.501 --> 00:03:36.850
<v Speaker 1>the different gender pronouns.</v>

123
00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.180
<v Speaker 1>Why is it so hard?</v>

124
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:39.650
<v Speaker 1>Why can't you just do what they ask?</v>

125
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.660
<v Speaker 1>My pronouns are not preferred c and the thing is like,</v>

126
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.300
<v Speaker 1>I feel like there's enough people going okay,</v>

127
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.430
<v Speaker 1>really that it's kind of a legitimate thing to not be 100% on board with us.</v>

128
00:03:51.431 --> 00:03:52.150
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Whatever it is that's got a beard.</v>

149
00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.441
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>

150
00:04:26.441 --> 00:04:28.870
<v Speaker 1>I know it doesn't have a preferred gender pronoun.</v>

151
00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.070
<v Speaker 1>Well that's what you're looking at.</v>

152
00:04:30.071 --> 00:04:30.904
<v Speaker 1>We're going to get to,</v>

153
00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:32.500
<v Speaker 1>so that's the thing now,</v>

154
00:04:32.501 --> 00:04:32.741
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

155
00:04:32.741 --> 00:04:34.270
<v Speaker 1>You can kind of be whatever you want to be.</v>

156
00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.661
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

157
00:04:34.661 --> 00:04:35.231
<v Speaker 1>which is fine.</v>

158
00:04:35.231 --> 00:04:40.231
<v Speaker 1>I guess I just think it's funny that some people are saying that you should see</v>

159
00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.870
<v Speaker 1>this individual and lead with like,</v>

160
00:04:46.871 --> 00:04:49.090
<v Speaker 1>it's like almost like it's rude for you to assume,</v>

161
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.830
<v Speaker 1>which I think is absurd that you're going to,</v>

162
00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:53.800
<v Speaker 1>that it's rude to assume like if you,</v>

163
00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.290
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to dictate a different pronoun,</v>

164
00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:57.610
<v Speaker 1>I think that should be on you.</v>

165
00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:59.321
<v Speaker 1>Like a status.</v>

166
00:04:59.321 --> 00:05:03.820
<v Speaker 1>Like you should just show people or some people do have these little stickers</v>

167
00:05:03.821 --> 00:05:06.370
<v Speaker 1>that they put on my preferred gender Pronoun is.</v>

168
00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:07.270
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>

169
00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.540
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

170
00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.050
<v Speaker 1>here's a radio lab and this is one of my all time favorite ones.</v>

171
00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:12.740
<v Speaker 1>There's a radio lab podcast.</v>

172
00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.920
<v Speaker 1>They take it so seriously because it's radio lab and uh,</v>

173
00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:21.200
<v Speaker 1>there's a guy on it who's clearly out of his fucking mind and he goes back and</v>

174
00:05:22.001 --> 00:05:24.310
<v Speaker 1>forth between male and female.</v>

175
00:05:24.311 --> 00:05:27.790
<v Speaker 1>He switches while he's talking to you because I just switched.</v>

176
00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:28.653
<v Speaker 1>I just switched.</v>

177
00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:29.543
<v Speaker 1>I'm the man now.</v>

178
00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:30.250
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>

179
00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:30.401
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

180
00:05:30.401 --> 00:05:30.940
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

181
00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:32.980
<v Speaker 1>when do you get to be a dragon?</v>

182
00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.310
<v Speaker 1>Do you get to read minds when this book tell the future?</v>

183
00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:37.720
<v Speaker 1>Then we're supposed to respect this.</v>

184
00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:39.070
<v Speaker 1>You have to because it's,</v>

185
00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.390
<v Speaker 1>it has to do with gender.</v>

186
00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:44.830
<v Speaker 1>So if this guy was telling you about his past lives,</v>

187
00:05:44.831 --> 00:05:45.101
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

188
00:05:45.101 --> 00:05:49.210
<v Speaker 1>as a Roman gladiator or if he was telling you about the future when the star</v>

189
00:05:49.211 --> 00:05:50.140
<v Speaker 1>ships land,</v>

190
00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:51.880
<v Speaker 1>you would think that he's a crazy person.</v>

191
00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:52.570
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

192
00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:53.890
<v Speaker 1>But I think it right now,</v>

193
00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:55.690
<v Speaker 1>but we did talk about gender.</v>

194
00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:57.800
<v Speaker 1>As soon as you start talking about gender,</v>

195
00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:58.820
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

196
00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:59.870
<v Speaker 1>you really,</v>

197
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:02.900
<v Speaker 1>you're supposed to like give people the benefit of all doubt.</v>

198
00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:06.200
<v Speaker 1>Like even if you think you're switching gender back and forth as you're talking,</v>

199
00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:08.710
<v Speaker 1>like the idea that you're your genders,</v>

200
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.100
<v Speaker 1>like some sort of a seesaw,</v>

201
00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:13.790
<v Speaker 1>you're on the precipice and you can just go left or right to left or right and</v>

202
00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:15.680
<v Speaker 1>it is you just close minded asshole.</v>

203
00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:17.170
<v Speaker 1>You just decide.</v>

204
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:17.351
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

205
00:06:17.351 --> 00:06:18.530
<v Speaker 1>You don't understand Joe.</v>

206
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:19.640
<v Speaker 1>But here's the thing,</v>

207
00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.220
<v Speaker 1>are we different a lot of the time?</v>

208
00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:22.671
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

209
00:06:22.671 --> 00:06:26.780
<v Speaker 1>Why can't be expressed in gender like you the other day when you're cranky</v>

210
00:06:26.781 --> 00:06:27.710
<v Speaker 1>because you didn't get your sugar.</v>

211
00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:28.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

212
00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:28.850
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

213
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:29.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

214
00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.630
<v Speaker 1>Like what dance,</v>

215
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:32.660
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

216
00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.340
<v Speaker 1>You have a different personality trait.</v>

217
00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.830
<v Speaker 1>You fell into this bitchy it doesn't like but doesn't like that.</v>

218
00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:43.880
<v Speaker 1>That feeling that the going back like sexist and need a fire join up jetboat</v>

219
00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:45.550
<v Speaker 1>phobic nervous.</v>

220
00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:46.543
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

221
00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:47.923
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking forward.</v>

222
00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:51.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking forward to ignoring so many emails that are going to come into my</v>

223
00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:52.970
<v Speaker 1>inbox about this conversation,</v>

224
00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:53.853
<v Speaker 1>but too,</v>

225
00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:55.220
<v Speaker 1>but people get mad.</v>

226
00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:55.491
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

227
00:06:55.491 --> 00:06:56.720
<v Speaker 1>I know they're going to get so mad.</v>

228
00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:57.650
<v Speaker 1>My point is like,</v>

229
00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.000
<v Speaker 1>we've talked about this,</v>

230
00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:03.980
<v Speaker 1>like if you're feeling particularly lovie dovie right,</v>

231
00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:05.990
<v Speaker 1>you're the pet and kittens and you're,</v>

232
00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:08.630
<v Speaker 1>you're putting your daughter's hair in ponytails.</v>

233
00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:11.150
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] it's a more feminine feeling.</v>

234
00:07:11.151 --> 00:07:13.670
<v Speaker 1>So did you switch genders at that moment?</v>

235
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:14.031
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

236
00:07:14.031 --> 00:07:15.590
<v Speaker 1>You still specifically,</v>

237
00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:20.560
<v Speaker 1>this guy wanted to go back and forth to being recognized as a man and then</v>

238
00:07:20.561 --> 00:07:23.390
<v Speaker 1>recommend the middle of the conversation and then as he goes back and forth,</v>

239
00:07:23.391 --> 00:07:24.800
<v Speaker 1>he becomes a totally different person.</v>

240
00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:25.611
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

241
00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:26.240
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

242
00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.040
<v Speaker 1>Like he's not going to tolerate any bullshit.</v>

243
00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:29.410
<v Speaker 1>I think usually in the military too.</v>

244
00:07:29.411 --> 00:07:29.800
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

245
00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:30.320
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>

246
00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:30.530
<v Speaker 1>hmm.</v>

247
00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:31.970
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of weirdness to the story.</v>

248
00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.250
<v Speaker 1>And he's under the care of a psychiatrist though,</v>

249
00:07:34.251 --> 00:07:34.510
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

250
00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:34.640
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

251
00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:34.751
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

252
00:07:34.751 --> 00:07:34.941
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

253
00:07:34.941 --> 00:07:35.091
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

254
00:07:35.091 --> 00:07:38.270
<v Speaker 1>He's wondering around getting government grants and great.</v>

255
00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.081
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

256
00:07:39.081 --> 00:07:39.740
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>

257
00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:40.730
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea what he's doing.</v>

258
00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:41.953
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

259
00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:43.303
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

260
00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:45.530
<v Speaker 1>you never go.</v>

261
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:49.790
<v Speaker 1>Like if someone goes back and forth and pretends to be Hungarian,</v>

262
00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:51.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm Hungarian.</v>

263
00:07:51.381 --> 00:07:51.591
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

264
00:07:51.591 --> 00:07:51.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>

265
00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:52.051
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

266
00:07:52.051 --> 00:07:52.281
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

267
00:07:52.281 --> 00:07:52.461
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

268
00:07:52.461 --> 00:07:53.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm from Ireland right now,</v>

269
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.670
<v Speaker 1>but I feel today I'm now I'm Hungarian again.</v>

270
00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:55.941
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

271
00:07:55.941 --> 00:07:57.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm identifying that way.</v>

272
00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:57.850
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

273
00:07:57.850 --> 00:07:58.181
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>

274
00:07:58.181 --> 00:07:58.331
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

275
00:07:58.331 --> 00:07:58.841
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing,</v>

276
00:07:58.841 --> 00:08:01.060
<v Speaker 2>if you want to identify throughout the day,</v>

277
00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.010
<v Speaker 2>sometimes I am more masculine.</v>

278
00:08:03.011 --> 00:08:05.080
<v Speaker 2>When I'm at the comedy store performing,</v>

279
00:08:05.081 --> 00:08:06.760
<v Speaker 2>I am very alpha male.</v>

280
00:08:06.761 --> 00:08:07.594
<v Speaker 2>I'm very,</v>

281
00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:08.453
<v Speaker 2>it's macho,</v>

282
00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:09.251
<v Speaker 2>but I do,</v>

283
00:08:09.251 --> 00:08:13.750
<v Speaker 2>I have to demand that people know what to call me at every given moment.</v>

284
00:08:13.751 --> 00:08:15.310
<v Speaker 2>That's a little unrealistic.</v>

285
00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:16.390
<v Speaker 2>What's a new thing?</v>

286
00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:19.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's so presumptuous.</v>

287
00:08:19.091 --> 00:08:22.080
<v Speaker 2>A narcissistic that you should know what to call.</v>

288
00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:25.400
<v Speaker 1>Does this person at least say like right now,</v>

289
00:08:25.401 --> 00:08:26.780
<v Speaker 1>address me as her,</v>

290
00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:27.350
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

291
00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:27.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

292
00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:29.210
<v Speaker 1>My shooter for names.</v>

293
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:31.220
<v Speaker 1>He looks snip and you just see the shit out of them.</v>

294
00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:32.240
<v Speaker 1>Depending on who I'm,</v>

295
00:08:32.241 --> 00:08:36.200
<v Speaker 1>I might be mis-gendering or not depending on how he here or she hears it at the</v>

296
00:08:36.201 --> 00:08:38.390
<v Speaker 1>moment when you get points,</v>

297
00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:41.030
<v Speaker 1>if you're in a conversation with that person,</v>

298
00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:41.993
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

299
00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:44.750
<v Speaker 1>Would you cope like you feel like that's a respect,</v>

300
00:08:44.751 --> 00:08:45.890
<v Speaker 1>like something that you'd be like,</v>

301
00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:46.091
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

302
00:08:46.091 --> 00:08:46.924
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

303
00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:47.320
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

304
00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:48.440
<v Speaker 1>I'll respect your wishes.</v>

305
00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:52.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm not changing your gender.</v>

306
00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:53.030
<v Speaker 1>You gotta pick one.</v>

307
00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:54.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

308
00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:54.651
<v Speaker 1>If you say,</v>

309
00:08:54.651 --> 00:08:55.230
<v Speaker 1>girl,</v>

310
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:55.460
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

311
00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:55.960
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

312
00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:56.580
<v Speaker 1>you're a girl.</v>

313
00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:57.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm cool with that.</v>

314
00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any problem with that.</v>

315
00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:00.180
<v Speaker 1>But you can't go back and forth.</v>

316
00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:00.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

317
00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:00.890
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

318
00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:02.040
<v Speaker 1>Where I can't talk to you.</v>

319
00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:02.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

320
00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:03.860
<v Speaker 1>it's too much work is in other words.</v>

321
00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:04.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

322
00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:06.060
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the whole thing.</v>

323
00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:06.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

324
00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:07.890
<v Speaker 1>It's too much fucking work.</v>

325
00:09:07.891 --> 00:09:08.671
<v Speaker 1>And if you're an adult,</v>

326
00:09:08.671 --> 00:09:09.720
<v Speaker 1>it's got a full life.</v>

327
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:14.730
<v Speaker 1>How the fuck are you have room in your head for the Zim Jerseys every second</v>

328
00:09:14.731 --> 00:09:15.330
<v Speaker 1>changing.</v>

329
00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:15.481
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

330
00:09:15.481 --> 00:09:16.200
<v Speaker 1>not only that,</v>

331
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.340
<v Speaker 1>that's somebody else's issue.</v>

332
00:09:17.341 --> 00:09:17.670
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

333
00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:18.780
<v Speaker 1>What about yourself?</v>

334
00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:19.681
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

335
00:09:19.681 --> 00:09:20.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any,</v>

336
00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:24.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't even be room to communicate with you because you're concentrating on</v>

337
00:09:24.481 --> 00:09:25.560
<v Speaker 1>yourself so much.</v>

338
00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.600
<v Speaker 1>You want people to change how they address.</v>

339
00:09:27.601 --> 00:09:31.890
<v Speaker 1>You just can you just change how you feel occasionally and not have a new</v>

340
00:09:31.891 --> 00:09:35.220
<v Speaker 1>fucking name three o'clock in the afternoon.</v>

341
00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:36.450
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm Bob.</v>

342
00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:40.560
<v Speaker 1>Why did we have to label it every moment of every,</v>

343
00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:40.951
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

344
00:09:40.951 --> 00:09:44.850
<v Speaker 1>it's a super self indulgent thing and that's what you're getting out of this and</v>

345
00:09:44.851 --> 00:09:46.260
<v Speaker 1>that's what like the people that are,</v>

346
00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:46.621
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

347
00:09:46.621 --> 00:09:48.810
<v Speaker 1>they're being labeled as insensitive.</v>

348
00:09:48.811 --> 00:09:50.220
<v Speaker 1>Like that's kind of the point.</v>

349
00:09:50.221 --> 00:09:50.821
<v Speaker 1>The point is like,</v>

350
00:09:50.821 --> 00:09:50.971
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

351
00:09:50.971 --> 00:09:53.130
<v Speaker 1>you're supposed to be insensitive of nonsense.</v>

352
00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:55.590
<v Speaker 1>This deserves a fair amount of mockery.</v>

353
00:09:56.540 --> 00:10:00.870
<v Speaker 1>The Fairmount afraid to in part because we're going to get shamed on Twitter.</v>

354
00:10:00.871 --> 00:10:03.120
<v Speaker 1>People are going to call us phobic of this and that.</v>

355
00:10:03.121 --> 00:10:07.560
<v Speaker 1>Even if you say something remotely on politically correct or whatever.</v>

356
00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:08.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

357
00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:08.290
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

358
00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:12.330
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of people out there that are just not happy and they might not</v>

359
00:10:12.331 --> 00:10:13.530
<v Speaker 1>be happy with the gender.</v>

360
00:10:13.531 --> 00:10:15.390
<v Speaker 1>They might not be happy with the way they look.</v>

361
00:10:15.391 --> 00:10:17.340
<v Speaker 1>They might not be happy with how old they are.</v>

362
00:10:17.341 --> 00:10:19.290
<v Speaker 1>They might not be happy with a bunch of different things,</v>

363
00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:24.770
<v Speaker 1>but we have like rules as far as like what you can change and what you can't</v>

364
00:10:25.771 --> 00:10:30.300
<v Speaker 1>change and we're allowing people now this is like a really recent thing to just</v>

365
00:10:30.301 --> 00:10:31.560
<v Speaker 1>decide to change your gender,</v>

366
00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:33.630
<v Speaker 1>which doesn't affect me.</v>

367
00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:35.730
<v Speaker 1>I want people to have freedom,</v>

368
00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:36.983
<v Speaker 1>doesn't bother me,</v>

369
00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:38.730
<v Speaker 1>but what?</v>

370
00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:39.953
<v Speaker 1>What is this?</v>

371
00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:42.840
<v Speaker 1>There's an addendum to the radio lab story.</v>

372
00:10:42.841 --> 00:10:47.400
<v Speaker 1>She made them edit out the references to her actually changing her identity.</v>

373
00:10:47.401 --> 00:10:48.234
<v Speaker 1>I guess she stopped,</v>

374
00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:53.450
<v Speaker 1>she stopped switching after all this right here and she no longer flips.</v>

375
00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:56.373
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

376
00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:57.633
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

377
00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:00.900
<v Speaker 1>She now remains comfortable as a queer trans woman.</v>

378
00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:01.560
<v Speaker 1>What does,</v>

379
00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:02.393
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean?</v>

380
00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:03.220
<v Speaker 1>What's like,</v>

381
00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:04.560
<v Speaker 1>it's not queer.</v>

382
00:11:04.561 --> 00:11:05.490
<v Speaker 1>There's not gay though.</v>

383
00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:06.811
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

384
00:11:06.811 --> 00:11:09.600
<v Speaker 1>I thought it meant that queer is like weird.</v>

385
00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:10.980
<v Speaker 1>Like you can do both,</v>

386
00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:11.850
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

387
00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:12.510
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it?</v>

388
00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:14.230
<v Speaker 1>What does queer then let,</v>

389
00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:15.323
<v Speaker 1>how do you</v>

390
00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:17.610
<v Speaker 1>know gay is gay?</v>

391
00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:19.260
<v Speaker 1>Queer is not gay.</v>

392
00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:20.210
<v Speaker 1>Queer.</v>

393
00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:21.630
<v Speaker 1>It's like non defined.</v>

394
00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:22.493
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

395
00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:26.370
<v Speaker 1>so and not a non defined trail on binary.</v>

396
00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:30.360
<v Speaker 1>That's Tom's domain.</v>

397
00:11:30.361 --> 00:11:30.751
<v Speaker 1>Tom,</v>

398
00:11:30.751 --> 00:11:31.770
<v Speaker 1>can you explain this?</v>

399
00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:35.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean basically,</v>

400
00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:37.201
<v Speaker 1>well you guys,</v>

401
00:11:37.201 --> 00:11:39.210
<v Speaker 1>you fall on the binary spectrum.</v>

402
00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:41.590
<v Speaker 1>Cisgendered privileging.</v>

403
00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:42.121
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

404
00:11:42.121 --> 00:11:42.810

<v Speaker 1>A queer feeling.</v>

407
00:11:43.801 --> 00:11:44.011
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

408
00:11:44.011 --> 00:11:44.820
<v Speaker 1>That's not it.</v>

522
00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:27.680
<v Speaker 1>the turn of the 20th century.</v>

523
00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:30.860
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of photos of transgender people from back then.</v>

533
00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:43.340

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:02.000
<v Speaker 1>they don't have specials on him because he's an extraordinary story.</v>

549
00:15:02.001 --> 00:15:03.740
<v Speaker 1>They have specials on him because you know,</v>

550
00:15:03.741 --> 00:15:05.330
<v Speaker 1>it's ridiculous and you're going to watch it.</v>

560
00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:10.761
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

564
00:15:14.121 --> 00:15:16.730
<v Speaker 1>The same reason they have a special on a lady who doesn't cut her toenails.</v>

565
00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:19.213
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

00:15:28.341 --> 00:15:29.650
<v Speaker 1>That's the downer.</v>

572
00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:30.060
<v Speaker 1>Nowadays,</v>

573
00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:30.920
<v Speaker 1>people are employable.</v>

574
00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:32.830
<v Speaker 1>That is the one common denominator.</v>
